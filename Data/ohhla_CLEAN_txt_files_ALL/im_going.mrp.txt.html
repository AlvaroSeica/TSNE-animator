Master P now that you have made it big time
what doy ou have to say to the people
who didn't think you could make it

[Master P]
Same shit I had to say last year
"Fuck Em!"

Im going big time, I got four girls in the safe
with 50 g's and four ki's I got a sure dope case
but ill smolder the task, fedz was all on my ass
but I got away clean, and kept the nine on the dash
everyday the games get deeper, the week don't survive
you wanna play you gotta hustle like a ninety five
now im rolling the car stolen, in the 92 Lexus
driving in California took a trip to Texas
come up, you see it aint about them games bro
its all about my mil cause I gotta get paid doe
with the dope fiends condiving, suckers wanna try me
got the wholesale and Im strapped when im riding
peepin' on the turf undercover police
they got me under servailence trying to check my car lease
constantly waitning for the P crimes to surface
one time on the creep but no time to get nervous
see my concerts are packed, people standing in line
Master P done crossed over, im going big time

[Chrous]

Damn task kicks down my door the got a warrant

im legit im never slipping, got a female like a trust but
the girl is always tripping
wondering where im going I gots to what I gotta
I gots to get paid girl ill see your ass tomorrow

she wants me to come over and bend over like robbering
I walk into the gate but im tripping off the doberman
my pager is blowing up money calling gotta go
my boys are outta crack I gotta keylow in the record store
im back rolling and im living like a mack
a 92 benz bought moms a new Cadillac
I got a mansion full of brothers and maids
built in pools security guards with a twelve gage
my pops is rolling large and we hella deep
we used to knock fool's to the concrete
now we legit and they can't say shit
chill bought a Lexus candy painted and no gold kicks
marvin's rollin' round in a BM
gold teeth shining fool you should see him
Daniel got a rag top better gold flakes
police sweat him boy they gotta get away
C-Murder in a 10 it went a Jaguar
hella beat and he's cruising like a movie star
Sonya C and she's got a poise and she's clockin'
cellular phone and everybody be stopping
police pull up they wanna know whats happening
but I dont sell dope all the sudden Im just rapping
in other words you see me i bust sope rhymes
cause Master P done made it big time, big time

[Chorus]
