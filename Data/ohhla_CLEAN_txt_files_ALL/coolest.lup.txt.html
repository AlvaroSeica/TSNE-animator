[Verse One]
I love the Lord
But sometimes it's like that I love me more
I love the peace
And I love the war
I love the seas
And I love the shore
No love for no beach
Baby, that's loyal
But she doesn't see, therefore I spoil
I trick, I fall
Run up in raw
I love her, with all my heart
Every vein, every vessel
Every bullet lodged
With every flower that I ever took apart
She said- that she would give me greatness
Status, placement above the others
My face would grace covers
Of the magazines of the hustlers
Paper, the likes of which that I had never seen
Her eyes glow green with the logo of our dreams
The purpose of our scene
The obscene obsession for the bling
She would be my queen
I could be her king
Together, she would make me cool
And we would both rule, forever
And I would never feel pain
And never be without pleasure, ever, again
And if the rain stops
And everything's dry
She would cry
Just so I can drink the tears from her eyes
She'll teach me how to fly
Even cushion my fall
If my engines ever stall
And I plummet from the sky
But she will keep me high
And if I ever die
She would commission monuments on her bosom
To hum
Or maybe she'd retire as well
A match made in Heaven set the fires in Hell
And I'll be
The Coolest nigga what
The Coolest nigga what
The Coolest nigga what
The Coolest nigga what
Lord please have sympathy
And forgive "my cool young history" as
The Coolest nigga what
The Coolest nigga what
The Coolest nigga what
The Coolest nigga what

[Verse Two]
And so began our reign
The Trinity, her and I came
No weather man could ever stand
What her and I can
Hella hard
Umbrella whatever
Put plywood or propeller panes
And pray to God that the flood subside
'Cause you gonna need a Sub till he does reply
And not one of Jared's
You think it's all arid
And e'eryting's ivory
Another supply
That means another July
Inside my endless summer
That was just the eye of the Unger
Felix
'cause he is the cleanest among the
Younger, outstanding achieving up-and-comers
The ones that had deadbeat daddies
And well to do mommas
But not well enough to keep 'em from us
The ones that were fightin' in class
Who might not pass
Rap record pressured to laugh
At a life no fast
Can you feel it (can you feel it)
Is what I got asked
Do I love her (do I love her)
Said I don't know
Streets got my heart, Game got my Soul
One times my sunshine will never hurt ya soul
Quote to a client dishonored baby momma
Whose the momma to the daughter
That I had fathered from afar
My new lady gave a mercedes
And a necklace with a solid gold key
Like the starter of a car, the opener of a door
Or two pounds of raw
You gave me a baby, but what about lately
Then ha ha ha ha ha, right up in her face G
There's more fish in the sea
I'm on my mission to be
The Coolest nigga what
The Coolest nigga what
The Coolest nigga what
The Coolest nigga what
Lord please have sympathy
And forgive "my cool young history" as
The Coolest nigga what
The Coolest nigga what
The Coolest nigga what
The Coolest nigga what

[Verse Three]
Come these are the tales of the cool
Guaranteed to go and make you fail from ya school
And seek unholy grails like a fool
And hang with the players of the pool
Fast talking of the hustle
No heaven up above ya, no hell underneath ye
And no one will receive thee
So shed no tear, when we're not here
And keep your faith as we chase
The Cool...</pre>
