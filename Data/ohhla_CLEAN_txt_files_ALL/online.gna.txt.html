[Verse I/II]
I'm on the line
I'm on the line
Once I clean my mirror, I'm a be feeling fine
Trying to get there, is all that's on my mind
When I'm on the line

Now even though I run my race
With a smile on my face
It ain't easy
No, it ain't easy
Feels like the life of the party
But it's all in your mind
On the line

[Verse II/II]
I'm on the line
I'm on the line
Once I clean my mirror, I'm a be feeling fine
Even when you're falling, just pretend you're flying
When you're on the line

I'm with everybody, but I'm still alone
Just look down, that's my line your standing on
Let's keep it friendly; we'll be just fine
But don't cross that line!
No, no, no, no...
