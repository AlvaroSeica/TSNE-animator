"This is a new departure in language instruction"
"I think Steve should be the microphone holder again
 because he was doing such a fabulous job drinking his forty.
 Are you hammered Steve? Aww, here's the mic Steven."

I'm scaring phonies with my predatory instincts
Violence with perpetual thought allows a will to think
Don't blink or you'll miss a split second decision
Leading to a man's demise with spit hectic visions
Now listen, my battle tactics move like gat clips
Penetrate a rapper that doesn't know he ad-libs
Extinguish an emcee with no originality
Cats afraid to battle me because I pledge insanity
I carry the mind that survived a backlash
And tore through all the rappers that became whack fast
It's a mad dash keeping it real in a world of plastic
I spark the mic against sulfer, ignite like a matchtip
Bellowing ablaze all my competition
Fury of the flame burns past intermission
And this mission is simple and spoke in one word
To try to decimate the Five is by far absurd

Thoughts moving at a million decibels, it's an invasion
Pacing, grabbing microphones at any single occasion
I'm blazing minds and locking them in purgatory
Step down off the stage, it's Five's territory
Thoughts moving at a million decibels, it's an invasion
Pacing, grabbing microphones at any single occasion
I'm blazing minds and locking them in purgatory
Step down off the stage, it's Five's territory

Straight out the boondocks to your boombox
I'm smoking whack acts like addicts to crack rocks
And attack thoughts in a weak state of mind
Like cats trading raps for a great and straighter line
It's not your time so stop playing the minute
When you step to this emcee you get smoked in an instant
I'm persistant with words just doing what's best
Leaving all my enemies to watch in cardiac arrest
I use the thing in my chest that's known as a heart
To tear all my arch rivals and nemesis apart
Using emphasis to start with the momentum till I finish
Results in every single rapper I've ever battled to be diminished
The lord of the mic has come to fight for his right
Spark the intellect and ignite like dynamite
My presence exceeds sight so check your headphones
And pop on a mainstream cat if you expect dead tones

Thoughts moving at a million decibels, it's an invasion
Pacing, grabbing microphones at any single occasion
I'm blazing minds and locking them in purgatory
Step down off the stage, it's Five's territory
Thoughts moving at a million decibels, it's an invasion
Pacing, grabbing microphones at any single occasion
I'm blazing minds and locking them in purgatory
Step down off the stage, it's Five's territory

I reside at a critical stance always playing a game of chance
Armies lace the path I walk but I must forward advance
Against these machines that draw nothing but lies
Half you cats emphasize shit that never met your eyes
So here I try to make a point of the matter
While all they care about is stacks of bills getting fatter
My laughter is a tribute of what's left to sample
Myself and Andy Able will set a prime example
So follow and acknowledge the words that I speak
Heads are pressing hollow and bones are getting weak
So when potent thoughts cross a mismatch of shots
I'll be slaying the mascot on the upmost of spots
Inject my thoughts and feel free to step inside
Beware the risk of when pain and pride collide
I'm fucking authority so lock yourself in quarantine
Goodbye to all the fakes, you just entered a horror scene

Thoughts moving at a million decibels, it's an invasion
Pacing, grabbing microphones at any single occasion
I'm blazing minds and locking them in purgatory
Step down off the stage, it's Five's territory
Thoughts moving at a million decibels, it's an invasion
Pacing, grabbing microphones at any single occasion
I'm blazing minds and locking them in purgatory
Step down off the stage, it's Five's territory</pre>
