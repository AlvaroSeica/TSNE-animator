Shining Star!

Intro : Ol' Dirty Bastard

Yeah, knah I'm sayin'? 
This is what you call making history right here
The Fifth Element
Earth, Wind, Fire, Sunz Of Man knah i'm sayin'?
We got the Wu-Tang Clan in the house, knah i'm sayin'? ODB
Yo Wyclef play the guitar man!
The earth is approximately covered underwater
? street walks for surfers
The sun &amp; moon had attract the power
while it's on it's way around the sun

Verse 1: Ol' Dirty Bastard

I'm the Eddie Kane of the Wu-Tang
Osirus with the fire-extinguisher slang
Maintain this paradise on this earth
With the shut the fuck up style
For what this shit is worth
Watch a nigga catch a purse
Super-hero niggas die
Do my dirt, get away and multiply

Verse 2:

Hey yo entrepeneur wisdom ? who
The dark kahlua, the black sire
Smack fire out of the liar
My heart desire
Speak truth and light this fire
The clever writer, not lia, never retire
The child teacher, mouth speaker, earth seeker, wind blower
To the seas I'm like Noah

Chorus (2x): Earth Wind &amp; Fire

You're my Shining Star, no matter who you are
Shining bright to see, no matter who's with me

Verse 3: 

Uh, hey yo this masterpiece be exclusive and fascinating
Street knowledge education
Teach the seeds son no procrascinatin'
Ghetto learnin' graduatin'
Blessed be the ones with patience from the ancient
God bless the child that could hold his own
Little shorties don't trust a soul it's all globe control
Earth Wind &amp; Fire, Sunz Of Man, and Wyclef
We connect like unanex and bring the intelect
We teach both sex, Brooklyn to Tibet, male or female
Who follow footsteps and correct

Verse 4:

I'm a Shining Star, beam of light from out far
Hits like these would burn holes through our resevoir
Espionage, let it be known who take charge
Come hard with the underground like camouflage
Keep it bizarre, mainstream for the young teens
Though if it don't be for clearance till 13

Chorus (2x): Earth Wind &amp; Fire

You're my Shining Star, no matter who you are
Shining bright to see, no matter who's with me

Verse 5:

Escapin' the ghetto
Using the bass tempo or treble
In the streets we carry heavy metal
Roll with the devil
Yo son life is reality, reality is life
People livin' trife, the world filled with strife
The god's livin' right in this act too many lack
Black on black crime
No vest, another nigga laid to rest

Verse 5: 62nd Assassin

It's been a long time
The beat's certain
Sunz of Man behind deens of wall searchin'
The heat is perkin' Earth Wind &amp; Fire burnin'
Sensation yearnin' and learnin' situation
Wyclef platinum hits
Beach nation is what your life could truly be anticipation

Chorus (2x): Earth Wind &amp; Fire

You're my Shining Star, no matter who you are
Shining bright to see, no matter who's with me

Verse 6: Ol' Dirty Bastard

Yo, yo, yo, yo, when I was young i taught how to produce
The science of babies gettin' loose
I turn white boys to Springsteins' Bruce
Blacks to blues
To the Chinese I gave Bruce
I can't help it if my style is foggy
Words to boogie getcha high on my patio
Or come to see me movie
Girls your walking on my dirt
I'm all in ya hair
Or mike your life plane call hurt

Verse 6:

To all my shining stars
From here to L.A. to Mars
Growin' up in the ghetto where times is hard
No matter who ya are
You a child or God
Born as a king not a slave for jobs
It's much more to life then to drink at bars
Large bank accounts and these fancy cars
Little King Tut's scheemin' when they lust
They get handcuffed for diamiond ring cuts

Chorus (repeat till end): Earth Wind &amp; Fire

You're my Shining Star, no matter who you are
Shining bright to see, no matter who's with me</pre>
