I'll stare at the moon when the sun break down
and feel the pain of that anger
I laugh then smirk put my thoughts to work
and caught a flashback of me six feet beneath the earth
I heard a voice inside my head
like james earl jones now my mind starts to rom like a cellular phone
I'm having visions of death but nobody's understanding me
what can it be it's calling me like brandon lee
haunting me taunting me to go for a kill for no apparent reason
except fo ra thrill a biographic imaging scanner
capable of multi phasic resolution
couldn't even penetrate inside my skull
resistance so what's the main purpose of my existence
I hear it I feel it he stealing my dreams
give it back give it back and stay out of my brain
and stop making false illusions to keep me insane with these visions

first the metamorphosis
no I metamorphasize in visions
20/20 right in front of your eyes I awaken
shakin like the earth I'm quakin
and I'll fricasee any
android or humanoid MC
just like bacon which is forsaken
cause my style splace le he he he ust like sprockets
to keep time must one keep a sun dial in his pocket
no logic please stop it foolish mortal
I entered your porthole undetected by no one
to kill at will so I don't set my phasers on stun
times up expiration date is 1-9-9-4
that is what the universal hour glass hath gave
you put down your weapons not even your primitive hand guns
can save you when I came through clouds parted
and it rained to heavenly father help me I move planet to planet
I survive on meteortes stars asteroids rocks and granite
with my tune I'll cut you in half like half moon
because of this MC's will be voyaging to my star ship soon
is it true that you humanoid bad boyz bust caps
perhaps I'll shorten your life span foolish with one zap then rap
your remains and blood strains I'll bend and twist dem
too bad you should've had a stronger and more advanced
life support system e e eeeeEEMm now I'm outraged
serious some say I'm delirious since I'm dred out of the three
does that make me dred serious for me to rocket
I rip my eyes out of my socket until they're bloodshot red
then throw them as far as the eye can see so can see far ahead
the sun makes my flesh dark like vader hotter than
what separates your planet into two hemispheres
which is the equator my radar scans the earth and from birth
I was cosmic mic name CHIP FU, earth name roderick
and I rocks it with my verbal poisonous venoms
that are toxic through my visions

I enter the atmosphere where not knowing where I'm going
soaring through your sky I'm flowing knowledge is the key to knowing
oh and do you believe in magic when times are tragic gagdets
don't give you life so if you have it go and grab it!
but I'm sinking! these elements of my main frame of thinking
creating the turbulence my ships dashboard starts blinking
DING DING your inner thoughts are set on the mental
and it's dreadful that my covers been blown I'm a clone
to society and I have the right to be laid to rest and don't bother me
cause my brain pounds wit the stress! as I stand
in front of my mirror my eyes are filled wit terror
urging me to slit my wrist I start tremblin my adrenalin
starts flowing so now I'm bubblin now I'm in trouble
the room starts to spin, I'm in sin and I see double
and it stops, outta my eyes fall tear drops of acid
burns my retina and my pupils rot from my visions</pre>
