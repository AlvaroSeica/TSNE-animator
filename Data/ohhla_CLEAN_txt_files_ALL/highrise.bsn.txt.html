Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Man I got my dark glasses on
Cause I'm ready for the big lights
All my money counted all my rubbers skin tight
Me I always stood out you was more the in type
I never followed suit u were more like pin stripes
Riding ye's maybach smokin so it's cloudy
With 3 girls who spend all day doing pilates
Getting money niggas think I joined Illuminati
Throwin west side up I'm feeling like illuminati
Now isnt it ironic that I'm in a big body
Paranoid cause every rapper named big got bodied
Boy, and my bitch got body
But I sit her in the back cause my nigga called shotty
And I'm a g o till I'm a o g
Rockin something high end like a fuckin o.d.
They feel a nigga from ny to the oc
If we down in the 4th quarter I take it to o.t.
Then take it to 1 &amp; o just take it to o &amp; me
Chillin in a hot spot cause I never get cold feet
Nigga you on the side lines praying for an audible
Cause when your legendary everything is quotable
Boy, priceless is affordable
Order what you can afford matter fact order more
And I think I'm a have the same thang
My whole team gettin cash I just call it gang green
Big is on the track ye be on the track
Since when kobe and lebron hoop for the same team
Can live my life blindfold cause every time my eyes close
I just tend to fuck around and see the same thing
Yeah I just tend to see the same thing
They say it's meant to be when you sleep to the same dream
I hooked up with g.o.o.d and been living a changed scene
I'm tryna turn these grey clouds to vanilla skies
Camera in my face I guess the future will be televised
And I'm as underrated as the beat bitch
Fuck it if I'm underrated I stay on some g shit
Nigga I chief up it's December 25, 365 forever putting wreath up
And your girlfriend forever wanna meet her
Tryna see what is in common but my dick is what's between us
Man I break her heart everytime I change hoes
I make a new style every time I change clothes
Man they jock my rhymes every time I change flows
One of the few gettin change but won't change for it</pre>
