[Esoteric]
My blows landed, those they froze stranded
Most by most branded, for life I'm precise
These so-called perfectionists must have no standards
Thinkin they're the don when they shit comes on
They got it all wrong, tryna step into E's world
They fakin jacks like the bootleg cheese curls
Please girls - stop eating up rice cakes
Have a nice steak for Christ sakes
My mic takes many lives, like 20 knives to the uterus
A pugilist, whipin out cities like Mt. Vesuvius
You jealous jerks - I'll rip you out your Perry Ellis shirts
Write a rap on the map and show you Hell on Earth
I pop fly shit, you catch it like Dennis Burkes
They only way you'd be well at work is sellin Certz
[Yo Esoteric, when you bringin the pain son?]
It's probably gettin done as we speak like Jenna Jame-son

[Chorus: samples cut up]
  "Captivate 'em before the raps deactivate 'em"
  "I smile with a sinister grin and finish him"
  "Crews I run through it, drama I'm in to it"
  "Right stupid"
