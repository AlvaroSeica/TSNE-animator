[Intro]
Yeah nigga
Old Future Wolf Gang in this motherfucker
It's a full moon tonight motherfucker
You know you fucked up right? {*2X*}
Hodgy motherfuckin Beats, Left Brain
Earl nigga, shit, who am I?
Don't fuckin worry about it nigga

[Hodgy Beats]
I meditate before I elevate, cough medicate
Set a date, date which I escalate, Heaven Gates
No hesitation, Wolf revelation
Gang education, Freddy Jason what it might seem
We shake and bake the cake, poison frozen icing
Fuck 'em all, ice cream, black magic, white dreams
Blue collar, purple tag label
You holler don't bother me, you sittin at the fag table
My state is euphoric and my pride is true courage
I reach for the stars, Fantastic Four it
Wealthy in my future but I can't afford rich
Presidential suite, soundproof, door glitched
Terrorists landed, bet it gets handed on Christmas
You get caca if you on Santa's shitlist
Receive a gun, raised on O.F. hitlist
Tongue lick of +Deathwish+ like a frozen big stick
Nigga

[Chorus]
Follow everywhere I go
Because, I'm from Odd Future Wolf Gang, um
Follow everywhere I go
Because, I'm from Odd Future Wolf Gang, um
Follow everywhere I go
Because, I'm from Odd Future Wolf Gang
They, follow everywhere we go
We are Odd Future Wolf Gang

[Interlude]
Yo, say O (O) F (F) W, G
Say O-F-W-G (Odd Future motherfucker!)
(Wolf Gang~!) Say O-F-W-G (bitch!!)
O-F-W-G (Odd Future, bitch)
Say O-F (W-G motherfucker)
Say O-F (don't play around nigga)
(This ain't the shit to play nigga)
Say O-F (Wolf motherfuckin Gang)
Odd Future Wolf Gang {*2X*}

[Hodgy Beats]
Mind Hype, like I'm White with attention deficit
Blind mice, I'm life spaz, make the best of it
Retard syndrome, purge and bend some
My crew isn't sailin, I'ma fuckin rip some
Bio, suction lipo from the fat bitches and dope beats
Golden grills, Caddy DeVille, suffocatin, choke streets
Subwoof, drug kush, trunk hella steezy
I'm like the sauce between the bread and the fuckin cheesy
Squeeze me, squeeze me, like a squeegee
Niggas like to bordercross, half pipe fijis
Believe me, I'm cool like the muh'fuckin breezy
Heart cold, dick freezing, never shrivel up
Bars loose, pit drivels up, music riddles us
Like women nipple jugs, full grown werewolf
No yorkie, eat beef, chicken, no porkie
In front of the class, eyeglass nerd dorky

[Chorus] + [Interlude] w/ different ad libs

[Earl Sweatshirt]
Got these faggots shoutin revolution
I am Earl, that shit's ruthless
In the booth, there's no spoofin
Bitch I spit like I'm toothless
Fool, O.F. crew, fool y'all fruits and 'em
lyin like fuck truth, dropping shit like polution
Dirty like a bum's unwiped ass now
I'm transitioning from class clown to cash cow
Indeed, I got steez to pass out
Believe I'm dope, a fuckin breathin crackhouse
She diseased on her knees with ass out
Ace got on ski mask, she gon' need knee pads
Supreme 5 panels and green hats
Y'all don't come close like Winehouse and rehab
Goin back, no, the crafty assholes plateau
Got the game in the motherfuckin lasso
Ride that hoe, cruisin in the music
with the attitude of two kids, make 'em respect my two cents
Could really give two shits, let alone a dollar
My flows flows make bros go whoa, your mother says holler!
Wack niggaz say nada, OF the best, no synonym
Still my pockets slim like the Olsen Twins, it's on
Off I piss 'em and dismissin 'em quick and my sentences
Stay Oliver Twisting like Charles Dickens death
Wishing competition but listen the plot thickens
I'm a stand up nigga, well fuck it, I'm not sitting

[Chorus] + [Interlude] w/ new ad libs</pre>
