Whoa yeah, welcome to Texas bitch... 
  
[Hook: Big T] 
A piece and chain, and my wirst looking glitty 
My top let down, and my broad looking pretty 
I'm balling in the city, (I'm balling in the city) 
I'm balling in the city, (I'm balling in the city) 
Everyday, I'm choking on that good smoke 
Sipping on drank, pouring up some Big Moe 
I'm balling in the city, (I'm balling in the city) 
I'm balling in the city, (I'm balling in the city) 
  
[Lil' O] 
Two birds in my couch, money in my pouch 
When I pull out the drop, all the haters say ouch 
Sugarland crib, you don't wanna see the house 
I am Fat Rat with the Cheese, man this ain't no Mickey Mouse 
Clout I live it, shout I did it 
Wanna come up in the game, better watch my visit 
Put some piece in your grind, homie get your bread up 
I'm a beast when I grind, cause I never let up 
I bet ya start plotting, when ya get fed up 
Then you being broke, get to boxing head up 
My attitude is rude, and my chick is spoiled rotten 
How the fuck I look, in the field picking cotton 
  
[Hook] 
  
[Lil' O] 
Whoa, riding down 59 at night time 
I get chills, when I look at that sky line 
Cause then I look at my wirst, and see that I'm fine 
My wrist, looking just like them lights look how I shine 
Whoa, downtown is going down 
Cut through the school, smell like I been blowing pounds 
Told my partna with the burner, ay hold me down 
Keep your eyes open, cause the jack boys moving round 
Yeah, I'm such a god damn playa 
In the H, man I'm bigger than the damn mayor 
Man this wrist of mine, will make a grown man stare 
Make a bitch open her legs, like damn hair 
  
[Hook] 
  
[Lil' O] 
When I do it, man I overdo it 
Hit the finish line, ran a Range Rover through it 
The first time I hit six figgas, man you know I blew it 
Swore that next time, I'd be smarter like a Harvard student 
Whoa, got my money back on track 
Instead the plans, did the hemi thang black on black 
Now all the broads that was talking down, back on sack 
When they try to hop in front, I tell em naw hop in back 
Whoa, Fat Rat with the Cheese nigga 
Ask around man, these boys know me nigga 
Bet they tell ya, I'm a triple O.G. nigga 
This ain't no front or an act, this is me nigga
