	Uncle Danjaahhhh, could you read us a bedtime story?
	Pleeeeeeeease?
Hahahah, alright
Y'all shorties get into bed
And I'll get the story book, knahmsayin?
You all tucked in?
	(Yes, yes, yes we are)
Here we go

[Danja Mowf]
Once upon a time, I went to an orgy with Georgie Porgie
He hooked me up with Jill from the 'Ville
I found my thrill, she wasn't on the pill
Now Jack's in my grill frontin, who he gonna kill?
Nigga chill, take these beans and a-walk (uh-huh)
Plant em in New York and they'll grow into a weedstalk
He asked me, "Was the chronic ?"
I said, "Ask them three mice, them rodents STAY nice"
Hush my nigga, don't say a word
This, be the bomb if you ain't heard
If this weed don't get you lit
then we can just forget, the whole damn shhhhhh
Now Jack's goin North like Ollie
Good Golly, Miss Dolly My Baby
Now it gets crazy, Jack got a ride with Bo Peep (uh-huh)
in her Jeep, with Ba Ba, the Black Sheep
Now up North Ba Ba's got pull
He own a sess crop wit 'tree' bags full
But now he's scheamin on the weedstore
That's my word, I overheard, that nigga talk
He said, "We'll be arrivin in New York soon
I'm gonna take them beans like the dish jacked the bowl
for a spoon - meet me on the ave about noon
Right on the corner, and bring Big Jack Horner"
Well Jack Horner got his OWN corner (yeah)
His own avenue, crew, and a brand new crack shoe
What could that old lady do?
They got her kids servin bids
all the rest servin rock on the block {*phone rings*}
	"It's a call on the horn Jack!"
"Hey my man Simple Simon, what you wanna get high man?"
	"Nah troop, but I got the scoop
	 on some magical sess beans on the scene
	 that's bound to intervene with the home team cream
	 Know what I mean?"
"Yeah, what's gonna happen to my crack fiends
 like the Butcher, the Baker, the Crack Pipe Maker
 the Pied Piper, and Peter Piper would get hyper
 Little Miss Muffett couldn't puff it
 And how would the Billy Goats Gruff get blowed?  Oh no!
 The kid's got to go, the kid's got to get it
 So call Ba Ba, tell the Black Sheep I'm widdit"
Yeah, well Black Sheep told Jack you know a spot
where the fiends go a lot and the weed would grow a lot
He also knew the Golden Goose, with the juice
And word to his Mother Hubbard, he could introduce
{*tires peel*} They pulled in the alley by the fence (uh-huh)
Jack bought a five, ??, and some incense
from Big Peter, the bean pie eater
And Jack Sprat, the cat who didn't eat pork fat
At the end of the alley on the corner
they met up with Big Jack Horner
	"I wanna see them beans," said Jack
Out came the sack, out came the gat from Horner's back
	"Aiyyo this little niggy's got a drug market (right)
	 This little niggy's got a gun (right)
	 This little niggy's got the most beef (right)
	 so you little niggies gettin done!  {*automatic*}
	 Let's run, B. Nimble, B. Quick, Ba Ba get the sack
	 Let's split,"
"Nah we ain't splittin sh.. {*gun cocks*} BLAOW!"
	"Aowww, quit, I'm hit
	 Who's the culprit?"
Black Sheep then admits
"It's me old man, I shot you
 Point blank range with a thirty-two
 With a click-clack boom-bap straight to the dome
 Black Sheep, Bo Peep rollin home, hah hah!"
Black Sheep laughin in the Jeep
Tellin Bo Peep bout the dough he's gonna reap
The mansions, the yachts, the cars in the garage
The weed would feed, yes indeed, livin large
But all that thinkin never thought of that Bo Peep
keep a deuce-deuce in the garter strap
	"Now I'm the quarterback, wanna stay alive?  Take a dive
	 A bullet or the ground, yo I'm doin fifty-five"
{Aoooooooooh!}  Now Bo Peep's scattin in Manhattan
Drivin round, Broadway Chinatown
Chambers, Park Road by the World Trade
On the way to Brooklyn thinkin bout gettin paid
And how she'd have it made with the beans in the ground
Too bad she didn't look around, she woulda found
that the Brooklyn Bridge was fallin down
fallin down, her simple ass drowned {*SPLASH*}</pre>
