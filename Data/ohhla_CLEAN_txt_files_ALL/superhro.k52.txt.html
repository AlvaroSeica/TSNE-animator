Throw ya banner in the sky
Give it up for my superhero show love for my superhero
Gone hold em real high
You know that's my superhero you know that's my superhero
Just throw ya banner in the sky
Give it up for my superhero show love for my superhero
Gone let his light shine
You know that's my superhero

Now check the sky it ain't a bird a plane
It's the God man it ain't no lois lane
You need to know this fam now just why he came
Cause you can know his plan and you can know his name
You see I'm not the same since I got Christ
Right off the bat man I was in a dark night
And like a cat scan I'm in the dark right
I couldn't last man lost up in a dark life
I picked the wrong fights and I was stupid fam
Sin was the kryptonite and I was superman
I couldn't get it right but you came through and bam
See I'm renewed in life and cause of you I can
Now for you I stand just where I used to fall
Brought the hammer down on ya hand but you ain't thor
You're the truest God and now I see it all
Cause its to you I call right there just through it all

You found me right there just in my toughest need
You are a holy and your true that's the justice league
All I need is my faith like a mustard seed
Cause you're the air in my lungs when its tough to breathe
It was tough to see just how they took ya hands
And drove the nails through that junk that's the iron man
wasn't nails it was love held you high up then
caused you to shed ya blood that's quite a plan
you're the Great I am plus you're the super friend
you take my junk give me life and help me break the trend
you made me right give us sight help us comprehend
you take my sin x it out I'm the xmen
no need to guess man you know just who I mean
his light shines now w/out the latern that's green
the one who pierced his skin open like its wolverine
the one to put your hope in here's who he be</pre>
