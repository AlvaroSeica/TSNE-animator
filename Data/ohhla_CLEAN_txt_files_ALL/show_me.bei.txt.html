Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
Ooh, baby
All you gotta do is show me
All you gotta do is show me
Ooh, baby
All you gotta do is show me
All you gotta do is show me
(Me-e-e-e)
Ooh, baby
All you gotta do is show me
All you gotta do is show me
Ooh, baby

I've been watching you
just to see how for you would go (go, go)
You're gonna have to prove
make a move and let it show (show, show)

Girl, I know it's getting late
and you've gotta go home, home
But before you go, I need you to

[Chorus]
Show me, show me what I've gotta do
(show me what I've gotta do, gotta get next to you)
'Cus baby if you love me
I'll do anything for you
(show me what I've gotta do, gotta get next to you)

It's hard for you and me
to put our feelings on display (display, baby)
But if you look into my eyes,
you'll know why I feel this way

I know it's getting late
and you've got to go home, home
But before you go, I need you to

[Chorus]
Show me, show me what I've gotta do
(show me what I've gotta do, gotta get next to you)
'Cus baby if you love me
I'll do anything for you
(show me what I've gotta do, gotta get next to you)

Only if you... show me, (show me) show me what I've gotta do
(show me what I've gotta do, gotta get next to you)
'Cus baby if you... love me
I'll do anything for you
(show me what I've gotta do, gotta get next to you)

I know it's getting late
and you've got to go home
But before you go, I need you to

All you gotta do is show me
(Show me which way to go baby)
All you gotta do is show me
Ooh, baby
All you gotta do is show me
All you gotta do is show me
(Show me, show me, show me, show me, show me, show)
Ooh, baby
All you gotta do is show me
(Show me, show me, show me, show me, show me, show)
All you gotta do is show me
Ooh, baby</pre>
