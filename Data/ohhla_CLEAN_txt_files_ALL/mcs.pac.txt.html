[CHORUS]
Emceeee's
Master of Ceremonie [yeah!]
Emceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Emceee's
Master of Ceremonie, cause to me Emcee means Move the Crowd

[VERSE ONE]
yeah
a supreme mc has lots of girls
lets his nine go bang while he rocks the world
yo, a cool mc stolls thru the bitches
might be on the run down "THE ROAD TO THE RICHES"
a wise mc blazes thru
and he ain't NO JOKE cause he's "PAID IN FULL"
yo, a raw mc loves to blast weapons
you know the nigga motto, "AIN'T NO HALF STEPPIN'"
a slick mc is wet off props
he'll tell the CHILDREN a STORY while he let off shots
ah...a critical mc takes a stand
if you fear a BLACK PLANET planet c'mon raise your hands
people....a hard mc got to sell
his MOTHER said KNOCK YOU OUT while he ROCKS THE BELLS
brotha...a real mc talks so brave
and they also taught me how to "WALK THIS WAY"
what!

[VERSE TWO]
yeah
a natural mc never kicks a bad rhyme
the WORLD IS HIS, he be chillin at "HALFTIME"
a rugged mc comes with a better plan
always ready like yeah "WHATEVA MAN"
methodical mc's get the check
and they got hot nickels so "PROTECT YA NECK"
uh....a consistent mc will use a BLUEPRINT
to BIG PIMP while he schools his students
a B.I.G. mc rolls with a M.A.F.I.A
versace shades, watchin' ya, like "WHO SHOT AT YA?"
an entertainin' mc is nice to me
so put your fuckin hands WHERE MY EYES CAN SEE
thanks....a thug mc is just like a viking
make a song about you and you'll still like him
deep mc's is total OFF THE BOOK niggaz
MURDA MUSIK, they scare all the SHOOK niggaz

[CHORUS]

[VERSE THREE]
a SHADY mc pulls up in a mp
whips out a gat but the mothafuckah empty
a crazy mc, he always wanna SHYNE
till he locked up in a cell doin nine, nigga why?
a loose mc, he always wanna shoot
he ain't gotta do much, thats THE REASON he "THE TRUTH"
a southern mc will capture you
screamin' out "MOVE BITCH" as he "ACT A FOOL"
a creative mc is always official
even have his own language "FA SHIZZLE MY NIZZLE"
hey, a clever mc locks the stress out
he dont give a fuck like "KNOCK YASELF OUT"
a strong mc is crafty yall
he will catch himself "SLIPPIN'" like "GET AT ME DOG"
argh!...true mc's paint our hood
with SOUL even if it ain't "ALL GOOD"
yo!
