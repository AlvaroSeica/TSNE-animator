Song:   A Bad Girl's Lament
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I did it, I did but I'm sorry
Well, I'm really not that sorry
Why are you staring at me like that?
Stop looking at me like that
Okay, I did it but I'm sorry, but
I'm really not, well maybe, it's like
It's not you, it's just me
You know I love you, baby

He's just so tempting
He's addictive
I'm like an addict
I can't help it
I keep going back

I'm a bad, bad girl
I kiss that boy again
He does things to me
That I just can't explain
Yeah, sure I know better
Promised you I'd quit
Please forgive me baby
For I have sinned

Yeah, so I did it but I'm sorry
Well not, listen, here's my story
It's just surfaced, it's so silly
He's so sexy but that's all, really
See, the first time that I met him
He was taken, so I took him
Ever since then, when I see him
I try so hard to keep my distance but

He's just so tempting
He's addictive
I'm like an addict
I can't help it
I keep giving in

I'm a bad, bad girl
I kiss that boy again
He does things to me
That I just can't explain
Yeah, sure I know better
Promised you I'd quit
Please forgive me baby
For I have

I'm so sorry I'm not sorry
I say I am but really, well

I'm a bad, bad girl
I kiss that boy again
He does things to me
That I just can't explain
Yeah, sure I know better
Promised you I'd quit
Please forgive me baby
I'm just who I am

I'm a bad, bad girl
I kiss that boy again
He does things to me
That I just can't explain
Yeah, sure I know better
Promised you I'd quit
Please forgive me baby
For I have

That's just who I am (I did)
I'm a bad, bad girl
That's just who I am
That's just who I am (I did)
I'm a bad, bad girl, I did it</pre>
