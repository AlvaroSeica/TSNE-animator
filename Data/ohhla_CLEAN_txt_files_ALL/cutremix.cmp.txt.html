Typed by: AZ Lyrics

It ain't nothing to cut that bitch off
It ain't nothing to cut that bitch off

So what you saying ho?
You Know I'm the man ho?
Nothing but a bird I'ma leave you where you stand, ho
Heard you got a man ho
Hope he understand though
You ain't nothing but a creeper baby, I'm just saying though
Saying though

It ain't nothing to cut that bitch off
It ain't nothing to cut that bitch off

[Verse 1: K Camp]
Creeping on the low, hope your man don't see
She will bust it down for some damn Lime-A-Ritas
Chew me like some bubblegum, something like Rasheeda
Gotta get my partner some, she on me like Adidas
Baby, you can't hold back, stop flexing like you not
Your man tryna patrol then I guess he is a cop
But he really can't cuff if he busting at my spot
But I done had enough cause you making my shit hot
Blowing up a nigga phone, what I tell yo ass 'bout that?
Tryna hold something, hold my nuts, can you do that?
Can be playing around with that mouth while he hit it from the back
You can't say nothing now cause we all been through wit that, through wit that

It ain't nothing to cut that bitch off
It ain't nothing to cut that bitch off

So what you saying, ho?
You Know I'm the man, ho?
So what you saying, ho?
You Know I'm the man, ho?

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
(Yeaa, 2 Chainz!)
You know that ain't a real bad bitch, that's a knock off!
When I get that work I get the juggin' like hot sauce
All swimmin pool lakefront, Hit it from the back, rearrange her lace front
Stuntin', Tattoos on my neck and on my kidneys, if I don't like that ho I turn her ass into a frisbee
If I dont like your diss, I turn that ho into a frisbee
I throw it out right by its windy, three cellphones and all of em' jumpin'
I can see your hoes and all em' nothing
Yea I'm a don don', Don Cheto, Don Cornelius, watch the dawn spill
Pockets fat as Don Carter Jetter nigga done deal!

It ain't nothing to cut that bitch off
It ain't nothing to cut that bitch off

So what you saying, ho?
You Know I'm the man, ho?
So what you saying, ho?
You Know I'm the man, ho?

[Verse 3: K Camp]
Baby I'm ashamed, why you acting this a way?
Heard she 'bout that action, you can bring her this way
Hit her on yo mattress, make you feel some type of way
Pass her to my migos, they gonna bust it, Â¡Andale!
Please don't play no games cause I know thats what you like
Knock it out the frame, baby girl, it's alright
Yeah that pussy bomb, I just call it dynamite
You ready? Here I come, I can do this shit all night

It ain't nothing to cut that bitch off
It ain't nothing to cut that bitch off

So what you saying, ho?
You Know I'm the man, ho?
Nothing but a bird, I'mma leave you where you stand, ho
Heard you got a man, ho
Hope he understand, though
You ain't nothing but a creeper, Baby I'm just saying though
Saying though

It ain't nothing to cut that bitch off (Cut That Bitch Off) [x2]
