(*talking*)
Sit-sit-sit, bow down bow down
S.U.C., Laf-Tex bow down bow down
Louisiana, bow down, connect

[Hook - 2x]
We back up in that ass, like a shotgun blast
Bout to mash for our cash, nigga we back in

[Mike D]
I'm in that ass, like a hollow point shot to the dome
You want problems, you want war nigga bring that shit on
I'm ready like Freddy, for you light weight contenders
Jump in the mix with this click, we give you some'ing to remember
You cut throat cross out, back stabbing niggaz ain't shit
Trying to, impress a bitch
Knowing you ain't having shit, I crawl foreign everyday
Like it's a hoo-doo brah, bladed up and faded up
With codeine in my cup, it's just the way that we mash
On the Southside, when it's do or die hit the cash
Dropping nation wide, independent C.E.O.
Me and my lil' bro Clay-Doe, a thoed trio
With a mastermind stilo, miss my nigga P-A-T
But we gon proceed, a Southside Playa bout to take the lead
Don't mix my money, with you funny bunny niggaz
Get in that ass with a blast, unloading triggas

[Hook - 2x]

[Mr. 3-2]
We back up in that ass, like a booming ass blast
Mr. 3-2 doing boys, on twenty inch dash
We mash stash cash under the carpet, in the hole
But game is sold not told, independently we go gold
I hold the boulevard go hard, all night long
Sipping pints of drank, and blowing on zones
Gone intoxicated, bout to get my hands greasy 
Nigga I'ma kill ya, bout my mo'fucking cheesy
Fa sheezy, I'm the dirtiest of the dirty in the click
You run your mouth too much boy, we got's to cease that shit
Breaking down bricks, on a million dollar mission
Fucking with Big Bentley, dropping the belly in a Expedition
Knowing them haters listening, but they really don't want problems
Cause I'm blasting on sight, as soon as I spot em
From the bottom to the top, we gon mash for the cash
And I bust the ski mask, give it to me fast we back up in that ass

[Hook - 2x]

[Clay-Doe]
Right back at your ass, for the cash coming to get ya
Handling issues with pistols, say we them Southside sizzlers
Must be aimed at your missiles, so here we go brah
We back with E and Slack on a track, we on the god damn map
And that's a fact, bet your last bet your stack on that
Pack like naps, in his bitch spitting game on dats
Check my stats, seen cheese befo' raps
So if you wanna cap, nigga let's cap a nigga back

[Al-D]
See I'ma threat soaking wet, nigga ready for war
2Pac brought the pain, but I'ma bring some more
True killer for my scrilla, nigga think it's a game
My ese got the quethe, ain't a damn thang changed
Bang bang on the block, Mike D pass the glock
Since these hoes wanna knock, watch em hot the red dot
Boys stop like a glock, when I put my clip in
New Porsche dipping, shoot slugs in it

[Hook - 2x]

(*talking*)
We back up in that ass, huh (you heard me)
You better watch, your motherfucking self huh
Running round, with all that ol'
You know what I'm tal'n bout, and you know who I'm talking to</pre>
