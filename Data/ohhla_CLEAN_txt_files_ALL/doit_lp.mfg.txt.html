Typed by: GregVersion2@yahoo.com

Yo (come on man, let me hear it)
Put the kids to bed
Cause this rhyme is not for them (come on man, let me hear it)
I'm representing for men (Come on)

[Verse 1]
TEC-9 dreams and MAC-11 wishes
Infrared is beaming on the target making sure there is no misses
Your funeral, you know who's blowin' kisses at your widow
It sound fucked up but your widow's doing ditto kiddo
Get with me, on your death she didn't dwell
You're living up in Heaven but I know you're mad as hell
No one knows I killed you except you
(And we all know that dead men can't do shhhh)
Homicides in the dark, can't trace the bullet
Pick up the shell, dug the lead out your fucking heart
Shaking gates in Heaven because she's fucking me
Swinging on God cause you need Heaven's keys to get to me
Your spirit ain't shit to me, kid step to me
You're history, a ghostbuster ass kickin' victory
When it come to hardcore I am epitome of evil
So don't pull stunts like Knievel
Brainstorm

[Chorus]
Do it for the kids man, the kids
I rhyme for niggas in the street or locked up that's doing bids
Do it for the kids goddamn it
I rhyme for brothers walkin' dead and for those who left the planet

[Verse 2]
Violence in the belly of the beast won't cease
I've packed a piece since lease was born permanently creased
Far from weak, not too many better
Hardcore is color black but I shine like patent leather
Food for thought, hush, eat my words with you mind
Emcees are grapes and grapes are crushed to wine
A deadly breed, no fad or bad seed
You never forget me like the Jews will never forget Hitler's bad deed
Brain cells are blown like a bike tire
In nights escape the mental hell by running through the verbal fire
I wanted friends to see me at my best
But I lost a lot of friends in violent crimes in the process
My attitude's a mess, I like drama
Forget about my problems, I smoke a lot of scama
I have few things to live for but even more to die for
My niggas out the street is what I strive for
Brainstorm

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
To die unheard, I won't grant it
Six feet under this planet, unknown, I can't stand it
Platinum don't mean shit when you're perpertrating someone else's life
And they life ain't legit
How we livin'?
We livin' day by day
Ain't no tellin' on Earth how long you get to stay
Microphone friction with diction in speakers
Cause feedback, verse bleed black, when you attack
Or, repeat heated words I speak
Weak beat, strong vocals, no question the beats delete
Grimm's voice is elite 
Everyone loves a winner but what happen when a winner meets defeat?
Nuclear thoughts (boom), radiation , termination 
Clouds of mushrooms spell doom to all creations
Fuck World War I or World War II see
Cause rappers gotta deal with World War me
And World War me equals World War III
We can rhyme or either fight kid
So what it's gonna be?

[Chorus (x 2)]

Do it for the kids man, the kids
Peace to my nigga Puck
Do it for the kids goddamn it
G Squeeze
Sorry (come on man)
Sorry shorty but you can't hear my album
Cause it deals with stuff you shouldn't hear
And life in the streets is what your mommy fears
Streets in the past brought a lot of mommy tears
you know
You know what I'm saying?
To hear my album you gotta ask your mommy first
But don't get mad if she say no cause in verses there's curses
I'll do a radio mix just for you
Still curse but flipped in reverse
And I'm out shorty (come on man)
No, I said no! (come on man)
You don't stop (come on!)
No shorty (come on man, one line!)
Let's go watch the Prince of Bel-Air (one line!)
No one nothing (one line)
One no (one line)
No (one line)
No, I said no (I said yeah)
I said no (I said yeah)</pre>
