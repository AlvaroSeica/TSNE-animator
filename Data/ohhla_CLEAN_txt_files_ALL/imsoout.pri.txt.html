Typed by: timmy.bogenburt@gmail.com

Ooh, I'm so out of control
Oh yeah, I'm so out of control
Oh yeah, I'm so out of control
Yeah

Oh my God, I mean, oh my Self, my tactics are fantastic
I have every single chart position, so bitchin'
Turn on VH1000, what do you see, behind the me
Cribs starring me, and at the Grammy's it's only me and ten thousand more me's
It's time to drop out all the rest of the celebrities
Those on TV and cinema screens, those famous for somethin'
And those famous for nothin'
It must only be me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me
But there are still places that don't kno my face
What is the market like in Cambodia, so what they don't got soda or rice
What they need is a big dance hit to feel nice, yeah

Duplicant CC5794, get over there and learn the language
You might wanna bring a couple of sandwiches in your baggage
What we need is a big dance song, that's slightly European
Let's have a marketing meeting, the negotiator will be procedin'

[Negotiator]
These ain't people, they're territories, commit CD statutories
No individuals, just demographics, marketshares and tactics
We sellin' wack shit and laugh to the bank and back shit
But if you wanna be number one, you and me better start having some fun

Oh negotiator, you're the top promotional invader
Dark like Darth Vader and I'll do anything to ride your elevator
To the top, to the top, don't stop, do you know about my coochie coo
The best in the business baby, the best for you

You want it, I've got it
You need it, come get it
Marshmallow, hot candy
Oreos, uh, just got me
I'm so out of control
Oh yeah, I'm so out of control

Uh, you want it, I've got it
You need it, come get it
Marshmallow, hot candy
Oreos, uh, just got me
I'm so out of control
Oh yeah, I'm so out of control</pre>
