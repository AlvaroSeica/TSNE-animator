Song:   Love Lost
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Where did it go now, "where did it go"
Where did it go now, "where did it go"
Where did it go now, "where did it go"
Where did it go?

If I was to fall like some water from a nozzle
Or like a waterfall like these nuts when I jostle
I'm a superman spider man when I bobble
Get that kind of fast homie that's when I hobble
Write up on the paper put the message in the bottle
In these darker times I'm going out ull throttle
Suckin on the joints like a baby does his bottle
If I was a turkey I'd be King of the cobble

Curse and my dick in hand tryin to figure out understand
What went wrong hit my bong
I'll try to work it out in this song
What went wrong hit my bong
I'll try to work it out in this song
I'm caused a little blurry devastated by fist and fury
Drug me through undercurves, your punishment and end is torment
Amen to walk and lied a vi key guy when lighting strikes
I'll wheather any storm, I'll get knocked out but I'll come back strong
But this force was so powerful it devastated
Evil as evil gets, I found myself a war of Satan

[Chorus:]
Love lost is a love long gone
No more loving until the lost love wants to return now
Love lost is a love long long
No more feeling any love 'less it looks at the sun now
Love lost is a love long gone
No more cryin over spilt love listen to the thunder
Love lost is a love long gone
If it's done better run it will take you under

Where did it go now, "where did it go"
Where did it go now, "where did it go"
Where did it go now, "where did it go"
Where did it go?

Let me talk about it for a minute
Let me talk about the girl that broke my heart
I wish I could say it was just one girl but I got about 15 (scars)
Any more of these days I think I'm gonna treat her like a prostitute
All gone with a fake face in a fake place, on a fake case yeah I'm through
Double double bitch tactics, I'ma practice a little bit of that green love
Make money, money smoke that good
And treat another honey 'till they can't get enough
Girl do you want me, why do you haunt me?
Why do they make me feel like flying off the handle?
Nasty girls, you don't need that shit (nope)
That's because your damn hearts been bit
That's because you never trained that bitch
All because you never hit that switch
Get it, got it, good luck. come the next one
Get it, got it, reflect on that son
I'm a really bad example of a good man
Don't they understand?

[Chorus:]
Love lost is a love long gone
No more loving until the lost love wants to return now
Love lost is a love long long
No more feeling any love 'less it looks at the sun now
Love lost is a love long gone
No more crying over spilt love listen to the thunder
Love lost is a love long gone
If it's done better run it will take you under

Where did it go now, "Where did it go"
Where did it go now, "Where did it go"
Where did it go now, "Where did it go"
Where did it go?

Adios, sayanara, there ain't no need to even bother when we talk it only gets me hotter under my collar
Don't need no drama, no I don't need it, and no I don't want it
So you can take it back to where you got
Girl let's be honest, we had some fun for a couple weekends but then it was done
I should just what what you seekin but darlin' I ain't the one
We freak and fuck an (must have0 slipped and bumped your head fell in love
What was you thinking when I asked if all your friends wanna fuuuck?
It's no wonder why you try to hold me under
Try to suffocate me so I just can't breathe (just can't breathe)
You got your hands around my neck with the poison you inject
I reject you can't infect me (infect me)
I'm immune to the hate I expand and elevate
Cause my fate is to live life freee. (So Free)
It is gone and I'm gone, I'll just break out my bong
And I'll pack it with some sticky icky green

You want in on it, all 'cause at times I killin that pain, relax my mind
And miss my thoughts I'm checkin for knots
I'm keepin it tight with a ping when I rhyme
A smokin' machine, a bowl of the green
I'm toppin' it off, and just me and my team
I hitted it off for chasin the dream
Forever we ride if you know what I mean

I feel what you mean cause I'm diggin the scene
Like shovels and bubbles of cannabis green
I was a King, she is my Queen
Now I'm out with a gangsta lean, Biatch!

[Chorus:]
Love lost is a love long gone
No more loving until the lost love wants to return now
Love lost is a love long long
No more feeling any love 'less it looks at the sun now
Love lost is a love long gone
No more cryin over spilt love listen to the thunder
Love lost is a love long gone
If it's done better run it will take you under</pre>
