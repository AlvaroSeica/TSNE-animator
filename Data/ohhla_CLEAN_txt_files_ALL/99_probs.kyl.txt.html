(*talking*)
Yeah, the only problems these hoe ass niggaz got
Is that I keep killing em, run it
Ladies and gentlemen, I wanna welcome you to the hood
And just to let you motherfuckers know, what's that
I got 99 problems, and a rap ain't one
If you having rap problems, I feel bad for you son
I got 99 problems, and a rap ain't one nigga
Killa, ha-ha Killa run it, hey-hey

[Kyleon]
Keep thinking shit's sweet, like a Cracker Jack
I pack a Mack, that'll smoke you like a pack of vlacks
I'm getting money, like them niggaz getting taxes back
My chain stay full of them thangs, that's in back of that
That's diamonds nigga, Killa shining nigga
While you bitches, steady whining nigga
I'm in that 6-45, seats reclining nigga
I was at the bottom, but look now I'm climbing nigga
I paid my dues, so this perfect timing nigga
Plus I'm the best, do I have to remind you niggaz
My flow's digital, but niggaz still ain't getting the picture
I'm God with the flow my nigga, let me spit you a scripture
From Genesis, the revelation
My flow adapts to any situation, stay on that mind like that chick you chasing
I'm a gangsta nigga, get it through your head
'Fore I start busting bullets, and you get it through your head nigga

[Hook - 2x]
99 problems, and a rap ain't one
If you having rap problems, I feel bad for you son
I got 99 problems, and a rap ain't one nigga

[Kyleon]
Back in the day, not too long ago
A nigga like myself, had to prolong the flow
Upgrade my style, to a stronger flow
Now weak rap is some'ing, I no longer know
Ask Troy who the hardest, then you'll see
It's only two good niggaz, Slim then me
We created, a monopoly
He been running shit, and plus it ain't no stopping me
So think again hater, why you keep watching me
Cause a bullet is the only thing, that's dropping me
Not the labels, cause they know that I'm dope
And they aware of all these other niggaz, hits that I broke
So get a noose, if you think I'm gon choke
But it's not finna happen, if that's what you hope
Cause I'm finna blow, like a piece of C4
Ah fuck it, go on cut off the beat C-Mo, Killa</pre>
