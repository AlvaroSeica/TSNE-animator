[David Salas]
Even if they wanna say
You were never right for me but still I stay,
They don't understand the things that we've been through
Cause theres nobody else to love me better baby than you

[Verse 1]
There's nobody else who could love me like you,
And always stand by my side no matter what we go through,
People tend 2 wanna talk saying you ain't right for me,
But only you and I know what they never get to see,
See we been through some drama, hustling for lana,
Losing our first kid then once again your baby momma,
They don't understand how our love could be so strong,
Always trying to fill my head saying that you do me wrong,
I don't get their fascination, to break up this relation,
But they never imagine we have great communication,
So I brush it off...
Hold you close and day dream,
They can say what they want but things are not what they seem, believe me

[David Salas]
Even if they wanna say
You were never right for me but still I stay,
They don't understand the things that we've been through
Cause theres nobody else to love me better baby than you

[Verse 2]
I don't care who doesn't like you,
I feel the same way about you that I did in april
Your shy and so respectful
So I fell in love even though some couldn't take it,
And they tried to take you from me,
Tellin lies so you would doubt me
But some how we managed and made it all worth while a year later,
Look at us about to have a child
I see you wake up in the morning and lay down with you at night
I cant help myself but stare way down deep into your eyes and I know,
I don't need nobody to see how much I really mean to you
How much you really mean to me
So even if they come and tell me a thousand things about you
They wont get what they want cause my love could never doubt you baby

[David Salas]
Even if they wanna say
You were never right for me but still I stay,
They don't understand the things that we've been through
Cause theres nobody else to love me better baby than you

[Verse 3]
I could never let you go for somebody elses misery
Already had the times of love and hate the rest is history
I learned to move past little things in our lives
So I can fully enjoy the pride in being your wife
And letting everybody know they cant break us apart
So many haved already tried but they failed from the start
Cause I was never about to let some little girl take my position,
Ruin everything we have, for a time of bad decision
I don't think so
They can keep on wanting you baby, so you know thats why
They keep telling me lies to drive me crazy
But unfortunately, I guess they didn't know about me
They can say what they want and still can never take you from me

[David Salas]
Even if they wanna say
You were never right for me but still I stay,
They don't understand the things that we've been through
Cause theres nobody else to love me better baby than you</pre>
