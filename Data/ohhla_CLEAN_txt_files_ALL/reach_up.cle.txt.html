[Chorus]
( People ), it's time to unite
Time to reach up and defend all our rights
( We know ), there's so many people in pain
It's time to reach up, time to create a change
( People ), it's time that we speak
Time to reach up and demand world peace
( We know ), that we've all got to believe
We've got to reach up if we want to be free

[Verse One]
The top one percent of the population
Owns forty percent of the wealth
Over thirty thousand children die every day
In poverty from lack of health
This wealth gap keeps increasing between rich and poor
There's more slavery now than ever before
Although democracy's supposed to be equal
Government is controlled by a small group of people
Bankers and corporations are in charge
They finance presidents who then help them make laws
All the candidates are really pre-selected
So it doesn't matter which party ends up elected
Central banks control the money supply
The crazy thing is that they're all privatized
Every dollar that's printed and ever exists
Is a loan that we need to pay back with interest
The fractional reserve system's a scam
That keeps the whole nation in debt and that's the plan
This is happening across the whole entire
World, it only leads to global empire
The U.S. uses the world bank and I.M.F.
To pay off politicians and put countries in debt
That debt's so big, they can never repay
So they're forced to sell all their resources as a trade
At the end of the day, it's all nothing more than
Economic bribery and extortion
So more and more people are becoming desperate
Potential terrorists that can be arrested
And your home can be searched now without a warrant
You can be detained indefinitely and tortured
These laws are designed to destroy our liberties
So when we fight back it limits our abilities

[Chorus]
( People ), it's time to unite
Time to reach up and defend all our rights
( We know ), there's so many people in pain
It's time to reach up, time to create a change
( People ), it's time that we speak
Time to reach up and demand world peace
( We know ), that we've all got to believe
We've got to reach up if we want to be free

[Verse Two]
We live in a system based on profit
Regardless of what the environmental cost is
So in this society, monetary gain
Always comes first before people's well being
Now think about the theory of supply and demand
Everything is worth more the less of it that's on hand
If the goal's to make money by any means
It makes sense to deny people of what they need
In reality, energy is abundant
There's no need for anyone to die of hunger
Everyone on earth could be housed if we wanted
But technology that could help isn't funded
Instead businesses that control market share
Purposely keep all our resources scarce
People are forced to fight, cheat or lie
Cuz' there's not enough money for us all to survive
When greed and corruption is rewarded
It means our whole value system is distorted
We need to think critically, change our perception
Almost everything we've been told is a deception
For centuries, things like race and religion
Have been used to keep us focused on division
We've been conditioned to see ourselves as different
From everything else and that's the point were missing
Humans are trained to look at disparities
That are trivial compared to our similarities
And not just with people, were talking about
Completely detaching from nature itself
Our planet's a system that's interconnected
Everything we do, something else is affected
Without animals, elements or plants
We can't survive on this earth, humans have no chance
So look at everything as an extension of you
Atomically were all the same it's just a different world view
And the faster this realization spreads
The better off the world will be moving ahead

[Chorus x 2]</pre>
