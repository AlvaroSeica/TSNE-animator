La la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la

[Chorus]
Moments like this are amazing
Love it when your body's here close to me
Moments like this drive me crazy
Love it when your body's here close to me

We get away, get away no problem
You can spend the clothes baby those your options
We can go to Rome if you wanna go shopping
We can go to vegas if you'd rather club hoppin'
Big things poppin lil' things stoppin'
Show me what you want I say baby you got it
Before you came home I had already copped it
If they gift boxed it, "thank you", de nada

Yeah off top you can get it I gotta roll for you
Let me know if you with it
Yeah it's kind of grown but I think you'd kill it
Leave the kids at home baby this could get explicit
Kisses on your waist by way of ya stomach
Whole karmasutra book yeah we done done it
All the way in gotta keep it one hundred
Moments like this yeah I love it

[Chorus]
Moments like this are amazing
Love it when your body's here close to me
Moments like this drive me crazy
Love it when your body's here close to me

Moments like this got a real nigga trippin'
Moments like this got a real nigga slippin'
Oh one minute let me change my position
Now I'm in the back, back handin' straight pimpin'
He ain't do it like this baby no he didn't
Every time we finish you can shake it where you sittin'
I'm a take command 'til I'm finished with my mission
Left right, left right, keep a nigga 'sistant

Now baby don't trip
Tryin get love drunk can I take take a sip
See this wet drip from the corner of your lips
See this wet trail from my lips to your hips

Sex part of nature baby don't you love the trees
You can call me maejor baby that's if you were free
Tryin to stay close to me you don't wanna leave
Askin' can you move in please, hm

[Chorus]
Moments like this are amazing
Love when your body's here close to me
Moments like this drive me crazy
Love when your body's here close to me</pre>
