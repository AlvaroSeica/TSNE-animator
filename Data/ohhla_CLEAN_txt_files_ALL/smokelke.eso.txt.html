The Rzarector, Bliss N Eso
Worldwide Hip Hop, let's go

"Check the script, me and the Gods get it ripped" - RZA

[Eso]
Dressed up like the Joker, ready for a good night
Happy on the handlebars of a push bike
(What it look like?) It look's the Wu's in this
and I'm about to blow this booth to bits
So buckle up, click clack, front and back I'm on point bitch
They'll never win against a double-headed coin flip
Spitting pictures with the RZA, howling
All the way from Syd' city to Shaolin
King Kong chief chonga, big bonger
Beat bomber, double barrel cone puncher, bone crusher
The stone chucker with devils in his eyes
I can't tell if this is Hell or Heaven in disguise
Either way, I'ma spit rounds of dope shit
I even taught Bliss how to smoke bitch
So why so serious?
Put your fists in the air for this hydro lyricist

[Chorus: 2X]
Smoke like a fire, drink like a fish
Hope when I'm broke, think like I'm rich
"Check the script, me and the Gods get it ripped
 Blunts in the dip, forty dogs to my left" - RZA

[RZA]
I had a nightmare, that I slept for a light year
A thousand tracks was going in my right ear
Then I found myself trapped in a circle
with Eso and Bliss pza-puffing on that purple
bong, you trapped in the closet like my girl's shoe
Hip Hop done changed the whole world's view
I'm Mighty like Joe Young, my son carries a blow gun
We roam like we're chased by the Shogun
New Lone Wolf and Cub, cut your arm to a knob
Fill your body with holes they can't plug
Leave you with pains in your head that they can't drug
You covered in plastic, laying flat on my rug
This is microphone bullying boy, don't try to strike me
It's Crooklyn, Do the Right Thing like Spike Lee 
For real, once I get a puff on that ill
I get wild like Uma trying to Kill Bill

Smoke like a fire, drink like a fish
Hope when I'm broke, think like I'm rich
Rzarector in your sector
Bliss N Eso, let's go

[Chorus]

[Bliss]
Deep in the woods, out in a lonely cabin
Chronic capsule, flying on my doja dragon
The chameleon, holographic craft
Brought a bag of hash for an automatic blast
Beam me up Scotty, I'm ascending to the stars
and catch with the Abbot where I'm tending to my gardens
Running On Air through the night till the morning
Flying Colours like Killa Bees swarming
Buzzing through to BnE town, Sydney
Spot my smoke signal out my greenhouse chimney
You see in every village, Mary comes to meet us
State to state, another brother bearing bud to greet us
When we roll through, hear us rock all the bells
And I told you it's beer o'clock, all is well
"Cheers" So let's all hit this good reefer
The outcast, outback, racing bush cheetah, and I'm

[Chorus]

[RZA]
Rzarector inside your sector
Bliss N Eso on the flow yo
Hunzo on the beat
Killa Bees, W-T-C, come on
