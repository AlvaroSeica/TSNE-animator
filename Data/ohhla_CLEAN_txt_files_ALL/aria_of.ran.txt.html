They say the only thing required for evil to triumph
is for good men to do nothing.

[Verse 1]
No whip in the hand, kickin a can
Hurt in my heart and revenge in the plans
I get in my stance, everything's dark,
Dagger equipped and its ever so sharp
Hundreds have entered, to never depart
The most dangerous mission I'll ever embark
Is in front of my eyes, a castle so vast
Must overcome it and Tackle my past
My father is mad, my mother is dead
Can't get the memories out of my head
In the midst of my steps, I'm greeted by death
Who tells me nicely it's best if I left
But he don't understand
The mission at hand
It's easy to retreat And that's why I stand
Do all that I can - We gettin it in
Cuz Dracula's castle has risen again

[Chorus]
Check - it -- Dracula's been ressurec-ted
It's getting all kinds of hec-tic
Now they say I got a death-wish
Just-this... One time
I'll take my place on the front line
My luck has gotta change some time
I gotta sever the blood line

[Verse 2]
When My father rises he's put back to rest
The Belmonts are always equipped for the test,
The talent and nerve, The skill they possess
But yet, we got a whole different mess,
Usually after he meets he defeat,
He's in a coffin and deep in a sleep,
Licking his wounds, but he hasn't learned
Now he decides that he wants to return
But not on time, he had a surprise
Early to bed, early to rise
Use-lly a 100, now he's back in 5
Anticipating a hero to rise
But it seems that richter isn't around
Looked up and down, nowhere to be found
So there was no choice, I do what I must
Destined to bring the castle to dust

[Chorus]
Check - it -- Dracula's been ressurec-ted
It's getting all kinds of hec-tic
Now they say I got a death-wish
Just-this... One time
I'll take my place on the front line
My luck has gotta change some time
I gotta sever the blood line

[Verse 3]
This ain't a movie though I play a part
It'll take more than a stake to the heart
Garlic is useless and bullets of silver
Bounce off his chest if he ever is near ya
Undoubtedly this particular plight
Fighting the being that's given me life
It's Rough, .i Gotta face my father
..cause I can't let him take my honor
This has gone on for a century so know it can't take no longer
Searched every crevice and corridor
Taught to research for u Go to war
They say hes Stronger than 20 men
Got to be nimble if you wanna win
We goin in, My prayers are said
I cautiously walk in the lair ahead

[Chorus]
Check - it -- Dracula's been ressurec-ted
It's getting all kinds of hec-tic
Now they say I got a death-wish
Just-this... One time
I'll take my place on the front line
My luck has gotta change some time
I gotta sever the blood line</pre>
