(Has-Lo)
Yo yo, yo yo

(PremRock)
There's something wrong with my radio dial
So I switch it to the off position to get wild
On my accord
OD,overboard
Can't be serious... no please
No mission abort
Commission is missing the boat
Missing the port
So I frequent my own transmission 
To get it straight from the source
To get it up... get it out
Spread it out  with the word of mouth
Flip off that radio dial

(Has-Lo)
Grass to the root...
Heard it word of mouth when it passed through the group.
Draw upon tapes of the pastors of youth.
Sort of like batting the field of the past
But it's fast and it's new.
This is like You... Them... Me
Can't hear it in your countdown every week.
It's on the street
It's on your MP3 , it's in your ipod touch it's on repeat.

(Chorus 2X)
I keep it on to the radio dial that's my own
I keep it on to the radio dial that's my own
Can't dictate what gets played in my home
"Yo this jam bumping"
"Well that's my song!"

(Prem) 
I transmit the vibes 
Here's a transcript to the wise
Put your hands to the sky!
Im a wile out
like dust vials crushed into piles
Watching "Wild Style"
yaow, yaow...yaow
A frequency tuned in to drop out
While your favorite radio ready rap is a cop out
Fully loaded no payola that's corroded
I reckon color it in no crayola
Just a colorful record now let it spin
Let it blend
Like a fade or a mixed drink I'm faded again

(Has-Lo)
Sun got low and the freaks were out
And the freak got low
My team went "Owww!"
That's how it goes down in the scene
Any kind of rhythym is yours for the listen
Vinyl ain't dead, the just say it is
But this got a full color print
and a 7 inch with it
Now that's a limited edition
Radio ain't gonna play what I'm spinning

(Chorus 2X)

(Prem) 
Turn on the radio dial
Nah...Nah  Fuck it
Push the off button
If you want rotation we gonna need a donation
Your career's drowning? 
Shit we selling flotation
Now roll to the rhythm the rock 
the Radio pop, the AM clock watch the speakers knock and dock
No vindication for your syndication
No inkling of any kind of inclination
Just 15 minutes of quickly diminished fame
Too many stations ahh give me a wrist sprain

(Has-Lo)
Rahhh
Going out to everybody
Across the land from your main Man
The DJ with the 2 turntables and the microphone cables.
You know they been trying to shut us down, shut us up and shut us out
But without a shadow of a doubt 
I'll keep doing me and you keep doing you
Until the music is through...

(Chorus 2X)
I keep it on to the radio dial that's my own
I keep it on to the radio dial that's my own
Can't dictate what I play in my home
Yo this jam bumping yes that's my song</pre>
