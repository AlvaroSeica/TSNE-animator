Song:   If You Can't Say Love
Typed by: DrOpBaSeLA@aol.com

[CHORUS]
(Since you were) always here
(I even) wrote the songs (and all the) time we shared
and if you can't say love (justice) will prevail
(and even) love will over come (and all the) evil will fail
and if you can't say love

[2MEX]
I'll say it for you
travel the globe and tell everyone to aim LOVE towards you
the feeling's better than bass drums
I'm not the only person that's able to read the letter on your face hun
I'll make an alternate ending
It would all be worth it if I were to fall for defending
the LOVE on my 12 inch is a LOVE that's unselfish
above all the hellish because of your well wish

SCRATCH BREAK (DJ RHETTMATIC)

[CHORUS]

[LMNO]
It all starts with JAH LOVE gotta phillips head in a case
for your screw face brought a new pace
embrace grace cut the chase know our place
in a world of anger with piles of waste we're some do-gooders
with the filteration
we're mexican islander euro african asian
celebrate creator before creation (and all the) vision we're erasing

[ZEN]
Patiently taking all day waiting for the confrontations to cease
and the nations to do as we've done
replacement killers LOVE a good fight
a goodnight kiss takes the queen but protects the king's life
while worldwide peace is just a figment and now is where we're livin'
we can hold on to the vision, do our ancestors right
by our decisions, thanks givin' to the most
for the host of believers and this ghetto child's acheivements
to all the berevements we are...

[CHORUS]

[KEYKOOL]
Life is LOVE my wife is LOVE
impossible not to write this LOVE won't fight this LOVE
but I'll fight for what's inside my blood and beliefs
passed through my ancestory and family tree
from my grandparents to my parents to me
helped me get through the dark when I could barely see
thank you for taking care of me and caring for me
this one goes to those who show us L-O-V-E

[DANNU]
Don't stop saying what LOVE I'll say it with you
the music that we make and working out the kinks and issues
I'm seeing how the scene needs variety arts
just applying good ethics and LOVE is where it starts
got a lot of LOVE though from musicians to the fans
walking life in many circles understood in many lands
feels good where I stand much higher to go
take the time to say peace see you at the next show (see you at the next show)
