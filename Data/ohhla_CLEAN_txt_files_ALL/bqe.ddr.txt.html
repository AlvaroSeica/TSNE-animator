[MS] (Hairy Balls)
Aiyo, let the S, heads take deeper breaths when
The wind collapse, on your frame, cavin your chest in
Praise to the most high, the one who rolls mine
Spirit in now in the flesh, you love the way I blow mine
(And blow lines, like the herb I twist
Blow like fish, jungle when the herb palace) MS
(Plus HB rippin the sys, through the legs
Once around the back, and then switch)
Breakin you down like Henny H., better you Kenny A.
Quick to point wack competition on they derriere
(Border like Perriot) New York to the Bay
(Leave our impressions in sessions without a word mentioned)
No question my Force is takin it there, makin it clear
You tear like it's mace in the air, I'm tastin ya fear
And sharp as a spear, describe my wolf pack
Don't look back, these niggas got toast to leave ya cook back

[Chorus]
From New York to the Bay, everywhere in between
Makin it seem, like it's easy gettin this cream
L.A., B.A., P.A., aight
From Brooklyn to Queens, everywhere in between
Makin it seem, like it's easy gettin this cream
Q.B., B-Ville, Far Rock, aight

[MS]
Ain't no man like the S, who spit this gift the best
Been rockin way before Cocoa B's was Smif-N-Wess
And like the best, excite the rest, recite this best
(Hit like a human torch when I light ya chest)
We be the '90 versions of hippies, is you wit me
My heads got they eyes on you, just in case you try to stick me
That leave you stiff like a dick, G
MS pa, got your brain a chest scar, like a L full of clippies

[Hairy Balls]
Been through more issues, then the Time magazine
A tag to the team, me and this cat named Eugene
When I was small he gave H. Balls, sneakers and jeans
As I got older, he taught a soldier the power of cream
Since the Beck he left, and left me empty in ways
I know God love to test me, he send me foes wit no face
All the bodies we trace and times I got grazed
Hangin in hooker rooms, eatin shrooms, havin a haze

[Chorus]
From New York to the Bay, everywhere in between
Makin it seem, like it's easy gettin this cream
Atlanta, Chi-Town, Detroit, aight
From Brooklyn to Queens, everywhere in between
Makin it seem, like it's easy gettin this cream
Flatbush, Linden, Bed-Stuy, aight

[MS]
I heard that you ain't nuthin, without the BK button
I thought that stood for Brooklyn, back then I used to backspin
Ask them, poppin and lockin will tear the promise in
Had a mouth full before cats started rockin 'em

[Hairy Balls]
And when they screamed, oh my goodness gracious, I just blazed it
Wit more Flavor than the Flav, told me, can you taste it?
When I move wit my Force dukes, you can save it
Cuz we sprinkle all the seasonings you been cravin

[MS]
Brave men like you came from Atlanta, but watch ya grammar
I'm nicer than my Grandma when I'm swingin my hammer

[Hairy Balls]
Down in Bamma, scramblin wit the pro's and con's
I'm like 4th and 9, you know how I'mma throw the bomb

[Chorus]
From New York to the Bay, everywhere in between
Makin it seem, like it's easy gettin this cream
Texas, Florida, D.C., aight
From Brooklyn to Queens, everywhere in between
Makin it seem, like it's easy gettin this cream
Jamaica Ave, Crown Heights, Father Rule, aight</pre>
