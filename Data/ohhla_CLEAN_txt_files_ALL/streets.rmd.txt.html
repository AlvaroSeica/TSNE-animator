Artist: Remedy
Album:  It All Comes Down to This
Song:   Streets Are Watchin'
Typed by: Cno Evil

[Chorus 2X: Remedy]
The streets are watchin', I'm moving, moving
This is not for show, I'm proving, proving
We in it to win it, not losing
Feet don't fail me now, keep moving

[Remedy]
All I need, is a few pounds of weed
Fifteen acres of land so I can breathe
Struggle like Cappadon', wild like Costanza
Big like Frank Ferrara, mask like The Phantom
Murder like Papa, butcher like Calvin
Built like Cuban Linx, Lounge like Alvin
Cook like the Chef, resurrect like RZA
Inspect you like Deck, yet, Genius like GZA
Balds like Bokeem, money like my uncle
Move like I'm free, money comes in bundles
Revenge like Jackie Dirt, lawyer name Gangsberg
We rock the blocks, stand up like Lansberg
Stand up, welcome to Staten Island, hello
Where you can be a rat like Chris --- Tielo
He's a rat, too, and even worse more sense
Been a whole pack of rats from O'Brien to Prince

[Chorus 2X] </pre>
