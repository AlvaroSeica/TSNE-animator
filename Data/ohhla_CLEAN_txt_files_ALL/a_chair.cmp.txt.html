Lets get this thang started

In the club nigga heads get bust nigga
Oomp Camp soldiers fuck nigga I told ya
(We 'bout to throw a chair lets get 'em from the back)

Niggas be popping like they be running it bitch
Oomp camp mothafucka what you know 'bout this click
ATL got it locked, bitch you know we don't stop
Oomp camp mothafucka yeah it's on when they call
Intoxicated can't be faded don't disrespect hoe
Hit your ass in the head with a chair hoe
If I see you in the club you's a dead hoe
50 niggas pointing pistols at your head hoe

Chorus: (2x)
We 'bout to throw a chair lets get 'em from the back
We 'bout to throw a chair lets get 'em from the back
We 'bout to throw a chair lets get 'em from the back
Lets get this thang started and get 'em from the back

(Loko the Lunatic)
Get it buck wild lets throw some chairs in the crowd
Tear the club up I'm finna shut this bitch down
Set the roof on fire 
But we don't need no fuckin water let it burn higher
You said ok I'm finna start it, every fuckin body
I got 'em running out this bitch, I'm 'bout to 
It's got to be the Lunatic you know the only camp
Around this A-Town bitch be the oomp camp
Y'all niggas still in training bitch more like boot camp
So you don't want to fuck with this you better move out
Before we shoot up all this shit bitch bitch bitch
bitch bitch bitch
Before we shoot up all this shit

Chorus: (2x)

If I talk it I walk it
Everybody start ducking
Throwing bombs in the crowd
Attitude like fuck it
See we come to act a clown
Plus to shut this bitch down
Club owner and promoter got a mothafuckin frown
If you didn't know oomp camp now you know this shit
Lil C, Loko, Shawty B and Swade bitch
See the mothafuckin crowd 
Standing with a stare
Getting it buck don't give a fuck and throw a
mothafuckin chair

Chorus: (2x)
We 'bout to throw a chair lets get 'em from the back
We 'bout to throw a chair lets get 'em from the back
We 'bout to throw a chair lets get 'em from the back
Lets get this thang started and get 'em from the back

Hey clown watch out cause you standing too close
Getting deep in the club finna tear shit up
Abbed up ready to buck and not giving a fuck
See them fools from training camp so nigga what's up
Ready for war, catch you in the club say no mo'
Releasing all chairs hoe hitting the flo'
See you better watch your back
Cause you fuckin with some ???
Streets or the A beware for O.C hoe

Chorus: (2x)

In the club nigga heads get bust nigga
Oomp Camp soldiers fuck nigga I told ya
(We 'bout to throw a chair lets get 'em from the back)
