Eightball:
Close your eyes image just you and I alone
No instigators or player haters in our zone
It's on, we bone like two high school kids
Breathing fast pumpin' hard through the night and then
Watch the sun rise cheefin' on a cigarillo
Urge got your head feeling fluffy like a pillow
You know, what I like ain't no sense in hesitating
Sex for breakfast forget the eggs and the bacon
Leave you shakin', wishing I could be your man 
In the park holding hands with the kids in the van
On a sunday eating icecream at the zoo 
And everything I do, in someway involves you 
I be a crazy man to tell you no if you asked 
That don't mean I'm gonna be your trick and spend all my cash 
On your ass, but we can chill and do it right
But that husband and wife hype baby not tonight

Hook:
Living a players life, woah I be everywhere
Meeting all kind of women but ooh I'm playin' too hard to get
We can wine and dine till the morning light
But if you're trying to keep me baby I can do it not tonight

MJG:
Are you prepared for the creep 5 or sleep by
So ain't no need for you to teach I we each lie
Amoungst the sheets, and curiosity now waht you gone do?
Your clothes recieved by my butler that's providing for you
The luxury of my cottage covered up in the cut
Look ou the window baby lakeside, swans and ducks
Way outta touch with that fast lane
Keepin' it slow not here to critize 
The last man brother for fo sho' it's time 
You know baby space ain't hard to find
And eventually you gonna want yours like I'm a need mine
Indeed I'm impressed by your charism and charm
Everytime we do our thang you straight deliver the bomb
You got me sprung, sometimes but not I'm shakin' it off
Let's put some slack up in this thang instead of breakin' it off
The chandalears in the atmosphere doin' me nice
But I told you once don't make me tell you twice
Baby read me lips, not tonight

Hook

Eightball:
You be all in my mix talkin' bout "I be your fix"
Baby I ain't in the mood for no games and tricks
I got game, but I ain't ever had one like you
I mean one like you that makes me do what I do
But I don't wanna be your man or your confidon
If you don't fake the funk with me baby I won't front
Makin' love to a body in the dark is cool
And it's gone be somebody else if it don't be you

MJG:
True, laced out in pure silk my mind don't tilt
I got the AC kinda bumpn' cover yourself with this quilt
Now free your mind, time like this is good but understand
I'm a man of plenty thangs and plenty plans
Rather than, your average, sit around do nothing brother
Stuck on having his
Wrong way one way or the other, the vibe was right
Your laid back conversation was tight
So was the candle light the cruise and the flights
But not tonight
