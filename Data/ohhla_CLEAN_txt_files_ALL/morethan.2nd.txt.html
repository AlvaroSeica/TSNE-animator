[Gangsta D]
Hello bitches, tricks, tramps, sluts
It's the motherfuckin D, here to work your big butt
Got hoes in my backseat, niggaz on my nut
Cock blockin-ass niggaz tryna stall me while they know I'm tryna fuck
Aight fool, getcha clown on
You better check ya girl before I take the bitch home
And do a couple of things she's never done before
Start to spittin on my dick and send the cot home sore
Hoes like you and you, you gets nothin, bitch!
But the honor to come and suck a dog's dick
Sayin I'm cold when it comes to the ladies
I just can't let a little punk bitch fade me!
Niggaz can't fuck with the program
That's why they always wanna see me come and get down
(Ay aiyyo man, how you do it, man? What you do?)
Fuck your bitch and let her run through my crew
Cause anything goes, when it comes to yo' hoe
So get ya fine-ass bitch back
Cause the dick'll be quick to get ya girl sprung
And don't even have to lick the bitch pearl tongue
Cause I'm that nigga that can get your little coochie
You little nothin-ass funky-ass hoochie
Fuckin with a true'll get you dropped everytime
So back up off my line, cause I'm..

[Chorus: cuts and scratches by DJ Quik]
"I'm more than a player, I'm more like a pimp"
