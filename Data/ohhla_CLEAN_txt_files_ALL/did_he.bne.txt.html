(Layzie Bone)
It's the art, art of war, art of war
It's the art, art of war, art of war
It's the art, art of war, art of war
It's the art, art of war, art of war
We gotta blast them

Chorus:
Did he really wanna, did he really wanna, 
did he really wanna commit that crime?
Was really ready, was he really ready, 
was he really ready to do that time?
Did he really wanna, did he really wanna, 
did he really wanna commit that crime?
Was really ready, was he really ready, 
was he really ready to do that time?

Ya'll didn't anticipate a downfall, a downfall 
Ya'll wasn't ready to take that downfall, downfall 
Ya'll didn't anticipate a downfall, a downfall 
Ya'll wasn't ready to take that downfall, downfall 

(T N Tee)
Nigga's get paid, niggas feel pain
Point range in a court they hang
In a court for slang
25 years of my life never seen a light
Was it worth that?
Is you sure black?
Did you look him in his eyes when you laid the man down
Five rounds
Well I'll kill for self greed
Caught self defeat eternal death inside out you rot
Take a life, give a life, you the oldest one
Please Lord nigga don't cry now
Don't snitch now, don't run 
You was tough with the gun let's fight with time
Let's explore the mind with the Smith of Death cause you took his breath
Take a deep breath cuz you dyin' in here
Ain't no love in here
It's concrete when I open when you sleep 
A done deal, they got us fucked for real we lifers
Ain't no more sunny days do it your own ways
We programmed niggas to kill what we love
Our motherfucking self 

Chorus

(Layzie Bone)
They didn't anticipate a downfall, downfall 
They wasn't ready to take that downfall, downfall 

All the niggas better not move, it's a jack move bitch
Give me the watch that's on your wrist so I'm a empty out my clip
Put the keys down nigga, on your knees now bitch 
Put the gun on your mouth, on the lady where ya standing now
Niggas run like Jesse Owens
All I could hear was the silence when the guage started blowin
Ain't nobody knowin I'm a killa on the run livin' paranoid
Sometimes I can't trust my own homeboys
Scary in the night time, blurry in the daylight
We in the world well niggas don't play right
A nigga don't play fight, we seek and destroy
Tell the troop to keep it real for the girls and boys
On a mission for the lost souls
We'll meet you at the crossroads
My third eye nigga
Blurred eye open plenty dough
So I'm a target, hottest thug on the market
Gimme a blunt and I'm a spark it
Our misery is darkness bitch 

Chorus

You didn't anticipate a downfall, downfall 
You wasn't ready to take that downfall, downfall 

(Gold)
Lil' nigga didn't really wanna catch a felony case
Post outside store waited for the shift to change
Could've told you right now, went against the grain 
Put a mask over features stop wanted and heated
Make a dash for the cash and duck 211 on the (?) 
Got me stackin up the crop see me long as fuck
Don't call my bluff, get our chips up
Count two G's bag check cause this rapping ain't workin for me
Jack of all trades master of none 
Could've took more time in a cell
Nigga (..?..) pack guns for sport 
adrenaline straight bustin' out to hit the door
Where's the getaway car?
Headed back to the hood on the humble arrest, chips (?) like caffiene
(?) strapped with an uzi all day
Lay you bitches to rest 

Chorus

(Layzie Bone)
They didn't anticipate that downfall, downfall 
They wasn't ready to take that downfall, downfall 

(Meneski)
What you niggas thought, ya'll can disrespect the clique?
What you niggas you think Menenski is a motherfucking trick?
Shoot a nigga up
Naw wet a nigga up
Putting a nigga in the trunk is always real with me
Killa's roll with me
Hit the fuck and the Remy you better be feeling me 
Cause nigga's be killing me
My nigga's be buck wild and I be filed since a juvenile
Nigga I got too many styles 

(Ken Dawg)
I got to be fast nigga didn't see these niggas running off in the back
You hear my tongue on this track, now see his lungs from his back 
Cause he was sprung off the rack
He didn't come with a strap
Old dumb ass cat we run it up in him perfect contenders 
Six feet deep or facing a sentence either way it's endless
Square our bizness, bitch niggas last minute begging for forgiveness
Bitch trying to think of a faster way to end this
See he didn't really wanna get his self in the shit he was in
Grab his drags his monkey ass through the Benz
Make one example I won't describe
To let these niggas know we're for real about our ends, our ends 

Chorus

(Layzie Bone)
They didn't anticipate that downfall, downfall 
They wasn't ready to take that downfall, downfall </pre>
