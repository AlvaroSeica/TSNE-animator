[Adam Sandler]
I am the smartest man alive

[Intro]
I tried to tell all my friends when I was a kid
that I had powers, nobody wanted to believe me. Alright

[Verse 1]
Spent the last month feeling bad 'bout myself
I couldn't speak anything of real hope
And the day came when it hit me like lightning through my veins
A sudden change in my groove, in my walk
I got my lion heart and electric flowing through my brain
Shocking waves make me feel I can float
It's like the city is mine and the dark is my cave
I can't explain this sudden peace in my walk
I sure hope

[Chorus]
I am living my life as if I had powers
And tonight I feel immortal
I said tonight I feel immortal
Tonight I feel immortal

[Verse 2]
Bet you want to see me weak
Not sort of my thing you see
I'm too damn cool, my mojo too dope
It's the same old thing getting lost Day 'n' Nite, young and lost in the pain
So many times I've broke this vicious cycle
I got my lion heart and electric flowing through my brain
Shocking waves make me feel I can float
Surely Imma do what I want, ain't got no one to blame
I can't explain this sudden peace in my walk
I sure hope

[Chorus]
I'm living my life as if I had powers
And tonight I feel immortal
I said tonight I feel immortal
Tonight I feel immortal
Tonight I feel immortal
Yeahhh

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
I'm living my life as if I had powers
And tonight I feel immortal
I said tonight I feel immortal
Tonight I feel immortal
Tonight I feel immortal
Yeahhh</pre>
