[Big Sean] 
Today is a good day
I wish a nigga would day
Ride through the hood day (swerve)
Ride through the hood where I would stay
If I wasnt me, wasnt committed (oh)
I told my mom and my dad (what) itll be the last Christmas
In the hood that you can visit, oh boy I got it, no chasers
Cause the best mixed with Hennessey is problems
I took that advice young when I was headed up to college
Momma swimming in that debt, rather swim with the piranhas or the shark
Ready set go, on your mark to the top
Getting rich aint a blessing its a choice
Drunk and still drinking out the fucking bottle
I want a hood rat bitch motherfuck a model
You ain't alive if you ain't living thats the motto
And imma probably wake up tomorrow sayin, sayin

[Chorus]

[Jeezy]
Lets get it, yeah be alright nigga
Its the motherfucking world nigga
What, what, ay, let's go!

Getcha some time to just do it how I done it (AY)
First up on the first cause first of all you gotta want it (yeeeah)
Re-up time for every penny, never fronted (nah)
Showroom floor, paid every penny then I stunted (ha-ha)
Stunted so hard you woulda thought I was a stuntman (yeah)
TS4 with 23s Im talking jumpmans (daaamn)
Twos and thirds watch for the blitz, you know they rushin' (rushin')
Just dont get caught in the coupe with them birds, end of discussion
Them boys round the corner wanna sell in that Cal Ripken (Rip)
If them niggas think Im riding with that, them niggas trippin' (that's right!)
Yeah I got a magnificent hustle, cause imma grinder (grinder)
Told my O's, "I'm hiding you here, so they wont find you" (yeah)
What you know about a bag thats heavy as anacondas?
Bet you one thing, I aint talking no marijuana (nah)
Thats whats wrong with these niggas they think its about shine
You niggas get back to your grind, I think its about time (AY)

[Chorus] - w/ Jeezy ad-libs

[Payroll]
They say its my time according to my Rolex
Im bout to fuck the game, then your ho next (yeah)
I used to talk dirty on my cell, no phone sex (nah)
No yoga boy I was making blow stretch (come on)
Press the fast forward button, Im pushing a foreign something (yup)
All through my neighborhood, next stop is the haters hood (let's go)
My bitch so bad, but you can bet that my paper good
I do this for real, you lil niggas just fake it good
Its time for a new crib, its time for a new chain (yup)
20 thousand on me homie thats just loose change (ha)
Too many diamond chains that nigga a mess
But if you knew bout my hood youd say that nigga is blessed (4-1)
Detroit in this bitch, Big Sean what it do bro? (Whattup?)
Getting money four ways so I can buy a two-door (yeah)
Stash looking healthy but my jewelry got the flu though (sick)
The hustles who I represent, Dough Boyz we in this bitch (Doughboyz)

[Chorus]

[Outro]
"D-D-D-Detroit, once the backbone of this country
Now its the largest U.S. city to file for bankruptcy
Thriving neighborhoods are now vacant
Going from a population of nearly 2 million to under 700,000 in a matter of years
The people of Detroit really going to have to stick together to make it through these tough times."</pre>
