[Intro: Paradice]
Yo 'Po, man, what's the deal
With these dudes out here, son
Talking bout where they been, and who they be with, son?
Come on, man, you done sold 500,000 plus the game
Gold album status, kid
You been down with name brand platinum cats
Top shelf dudes, B
Come on, son, you know your man gon' know what's up
But you gotta let them know, kid

[Napoleon]
Yo, aiyo, I've been on coasts, I've done songs with The Clipse
Took flicks, with Kurupt, when he was strong with the crips
I did a video with Jim Jones, polly with Kayslay
My next stop is 106 &amp; Park with A.J.
I'm cool with Nicole Wray, I smoked with Raekwon
Way before the Purple Tape, that's why I just stay calm
I'm used to the lime light, I partied with Bubba Chuck
I seen Tyra Banks without the Maybelline cover up
I ate with Steve Harvey, hugged Melyssa Ford
We run our own label, yeah, you wish you could afford
To go to Vegas and sit beside a model from Eye Candy
Chill with Lil' Wayne, Slim and Baby in Miami
I've been to the Wu Mansion, vow with Spliff Starr
Catch me on the indy mixtape, I spit sick bars
Illuminati click, got hits, my man, The RZA
Try to rob the king of V.A., you won't get far

[Chorus 2X: Paradice]
I'm so entertainment, if I stop, niggas'll know
Where the game, I'm already famous, bang this, joint
In the hood (in the hood), on the block (on the block)
In the street (in the street), keep it hot

[Napoleon]
Out in Cali, I've clubbed with Leonardo Di Caprio
Copped chinchillas, from a spot Joey Crack'll go
Lounge in studios where Rick James used to smack a hoe
Fiends know my team from purple haze, D, crack and 'dro
I'm blood with Dope Boi, he fucking with Dame Dash
I'm known like Ritchie Valens, after the plane crash
I've been on a gold album, check the SoundScan
Pictures with Shaq, to, just give me my crown, man
I'm loved in the hood, where the roughest hoods wetcha
Leave you dead, hair red, like Woody Woodpecker
I'm a legend, my photo album look like a Source page
Nothing but stars and black divas with horse braids
My man know B.G., my cousin know Ludacris
Dudes tell girls they know me to get uterus
I lounge with Nelly to, I roll with Juelz
Sent flicks to Trina, tell my man I got 'em spelled

[Chorus 2X]

[Napoleon]
Yo, aiyo, I spit with Cappadonna, Quan and 12 O'Clock
I'm street like DMX is, Dark &amp; Hell is Hot
I stay in Hollywood, I've been in the magazines
Interviewers gave me T-shirts and a bag of jeans
Hung around drug lords, before I was 15
The whip started up without the keys like Christine
I've been to Canal Street, reforming the sale stones
Know so many people I can call God cell phone
The Syndicate's worldwide, my man's in Pakistan
We've seen more snow than most Green Bay Packer fans
I two-way Jazze Pha, kicked it with DMC
He gave me the game of ASCAP and BMG
I'm close to the Neptunes, Nottz my man to
Lord only knows all the grands we done ran through
We bought our own club, and wins to the boss night
Nothing but dons, that better come with your floss right

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
