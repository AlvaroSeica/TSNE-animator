[Solo]
She wraps her smile round her tired face
Sick of his heavy rap, this "Black Betty" wants to listen to some Spiderbait
And the sunshine on the window
But it doesn't make her happy like she should be
And he remains her silver lining in this tangled cloud of caps and hoodies
What role does she play? The lead female
This is no longer his monologue
It's the long lost story of this he and she
The lyrics to their forgotten song
Built first in single notes, then bars, then whole movements
He sang it proud from the rooftops
She kept it hidden with their ripped ticket stubs in a shoe box
Opposites attract
Until he noticed she didn't know the words
and his flight soon crashed when their wings uncurled

[Female]
This movement of notes rose and fell off the page in a slow mutiny
Their lost symphony transformed into two remote soliloquies
And this queen of hearts is now too bent to play
Uncrowned, she's pawned off her king to hasty trade
But it's better to have held aces and castles
and gambled all your stakes, mistakes make jokers of us all
A wrong hand played, it all shuffles and falls
A silver lining somewhere links it all
Loose pieces kept together, take it apart
Back to solitair, hearts

[Solo] + (Female)
She wraps a smile around his tired face
(And he around hers
 And for a moment, they aren't so tired)</pre>
