[Verse 1]
Uh, now here's a little story that must be told
By the unsaved man who lost and found his soul
It's a classic love ballad, those never get old
Let's piece together the tale of Sean and Nicole
A picture perfect couple in the eyes of they peers
Been together for eight, but only married for four years
Had one kid, both was true to their own
Just moved to the 'burbs and bought a beautiful home
Now Sean had a gift and for years he use it
He was an R &amp; B singer, sang secular music
Nicole worked in the daycare, she loved the kids
Had a nice income, but it never could match his
Now Sean stayed on the road, his schedule was crazy
Nicole spent a lot of nights at home with the baby
And this night in question, while out on tour
Sean made a mistake, she'd never forgive him for
But it's more

[Chorus] - 2X
We all hit the bottom but He can get us higher
The end of the day, we all sinners and liars
The truth is somebody's gonna burn in the fire
What's sad is, you probably think I'm preaching to the choir

[Verse 2]
Nicole was heartbroken, crazy sick
She had proof that he had stepped out of relationship
Sean was a hero, but after that circumstance
He was just a man who couldn't keep the shit in his pants
All her girlfriends said she was crazy to stay
"If it was me girl, I'd of left his ass that day"
Nicole stayed and forgave, made up her mind
Now it's five years later and everything's going fine
They did some soulsearchin, cause their love was worth it
But it's work though, cause no relationship is perfect
Nicole struggled, she was down and up
Some days she loved him, other days she hated his guts
Sean didn't know, she never told him the deal
He just kept singin, cause that's what was payin the bills
Livin in denial, that's a bad place to live
Nicole told him she forgave him, but she never really did

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Some time had past, while Nicole still struggled
Stressed over work, competin with the average couple
She was faithful, even after Sean crossed the line
When he was gone, she found ways to occupy her time
You'll never find what's missin, if you don't search
She started goin to the gym, then she joined the church
The experience she said, it took her higher
After six months of Sundays, she joined the choir
And when Sean came home, she threw him a curve
Said to come to church with her, so he could hear the word
They went to sleep that night, but when they prayed
For the first time he felt bad about the music he made
That following Saturday, Sean had a show
And it was 9 AM when he stumbled up to the door
And the house was empty though, he couldn't find his key
Drunk, gun was on him and he smelled like weed
February 14th and he forget to bring
Flowers and he told Nicole he'd come here and sing
So he walked in the church a half hour late
Uncomfortable, stood in the back, cause he couldn't find space
He just stood on the wall, rockin back and forth
The preacher preached about tryin to get right with the Lord
So he thought about his life and thought about his wife
And how short the walk was to get right with Christ
He looked up at Nicole as she started to cry
Seein her like that just brought tears to his eyes
The whole church started starin at Sean so hard
Thinkin this man is about to give his life to God
It's a guy in the choir, about to sing a song
Walked past Nicole, but their body language was wrong
Sean was feelin some way, something wasn't right
He started starin at the guy and how he's lookin at his wife
His heart started beatin, he's ready to flip his wig
Thinkin my wife ain't the type to do the things I did
The truth would have you floored
The man was married, sleepin with Nicole and there they stood both singin to the Lord
Damn (damn, damn)</pre>
