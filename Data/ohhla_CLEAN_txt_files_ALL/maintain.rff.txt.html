[Spitz]
Yo, I'mma call it like I see it
Crave it, but don't need it
Proceed it to dig into these roots deep seeded
And indeed is one of life most ironic infections
I'm born with it, no protection in this game so long
I think I'm immune to rejection
Search for perfection, desperation starts to set in
Settling for something less, it don't mean I'm worthless
Just don't want to deal with the stress
Of in general pursuit of happiness
Whole goal right now is for you to react to this
That's why, spill my guts, hopes you catch my drift
I got a gift rapped in words designed to uplift
My one true love I'm dedicated to this
Would you give it up, never go out with swinging fists
I can't lose you disrespect, or abuse you
I'mma stand alone and battle any crew that choose to use you in vain
Pimpin' ain't the game, the money or the fame
Back up in it, I will always be your man
We'll grow together even when these time will change
[Odario]
Word, word, word
We got to rise above, what you think of
Push come to shove, everyman wan piece of
R-E-S, P-E-C-T
The plan is to be where you can never find me
Rhyme MC, travel with the blind
The one refined, I see the trouble in all mankind
Practice mine, watch what I'm fiddling
I don't rhyme fo the sake of riddling
Black truck, you play and get stuck
Press your luck and your goooone
I lost my job today, because I was too busy to work for the man
Had other plans, got to give my life a stand
Like Sly and the Family Stone, you everyday people got to leave me alone
I'm in my zone making home for my soul, untold
Make believe that I'm in control
Slow, that's the way that the walk go
No, chance to pull in the pay so
So, we lay in the rock and just lay low, low

CHORUS [Odario] {Spitz}
[Everyday is the same thing, we got to maintain]
{Don't be slipping out the mindframe}
[Find some way, ease the pain
It ain't easy]
{I just do my thing, yo}
[Everyday is the same thing, we got to maintain]
{Don't be slipping out the mindframe}
[Find some way, ease the pain
It ain't easy]
{I just do my thing}
[It ain't easy]

[Spitz]
So what's my purpose to work this minimum wage?
Or to spurt this, energy live on the stage?
I'm not worthless, I'm done serving, keep your spare change
My job's to capture all minds within vocal range
And keep you open, open for the best expect the worst
Emmerson(?), a soul in the fluids like immerse
But reverse, because I wouldn't have it any other way
I'm so hip hop, I'll freestyle my resume
And initially said I wouldn't amount to much
The only trait I have is this mic I clutch
You get touched if you try to break the band between us
Us, we partners and we built o ntrust
When I bust, competitors know they dust
Envious, 'cause we can make a crowd combust
And a the same time maintain underground status
And still be the baddest when we shoot the gift
Whether we headlining or opening isht
[Odario]
Mad crazy, mad crazy
Mad crazy days up in a crazy world
Find your way, bring the truth untold
We getting lazy, and that's no lie
People tell me all I have to do is try
Well, these day trying ain't getting me by
I'm the type of guy to make the well run dry
And defeat the find, it will be you and I
We get together and we truning up the stereo
Coolin' out, we play a little domino
In a one love, one life scenario
So don't front, yo you can't see Odario
I take it easy when the worse try to hurt me
Tell the brother please, he don't know my steez
Ain't easy when we try to make these dreams
Picking upon these we going overseas (overseas echos)
For y'all that want see the world, got my napsack pack
Yo I got your back, no matter where we at we making room at the top
