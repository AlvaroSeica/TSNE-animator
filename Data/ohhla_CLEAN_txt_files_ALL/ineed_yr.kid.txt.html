Chorus: Fingazz
I need your love, baby (Need you day and night)
Your sweet, sweet lovin'
Let's make love tonight
Her body's calling (For you)
I hear your body calling (For me)
So let's make it happen, baby
Make you feel alright
Yeah

[Frost]
(Verse 1)
Since you been gone, girl
I really been on one
Just sittin' here by myself
All by my lonesome
I'm trying to figure out
Just how to get you back
It took me a minute, girl
To get that your lovin' is where it's at
I need your lovin', yeah
That good, good lovin'
I want it, I need it, the love keeps me heated
Oh girl, please believe it
Yeah
That good, good lovin'
Yeah

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 2)
Hey baby, I know exactly what you need
Just a little bit of relaxation and, just a little bit of me, see
I'm trying, I'm trying
To get you back, won't stop
When you give me of your sweet, sweet love
And we used to make love all night
Can nobody
Do it better
For your love is
Forever
Come on, baby, and give me just one more chance
And you'll see that I became a better man
Let's make it happen, baby, make you feel good
Make you feel like a beautiful woman should

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 3)
Ain't no tellin' what our future has in store
Why do I always leave if I come back for more
Got me fiendin', girl, you're so addicted
When I'm around you, girl, I feel so livid
Ain't no woman like you, in my life that always had my back
Then spark a flame when I'm rollin' up all them
Blunt wraps
Perfect face
Beautiful body
No time to waste
Come on, get on me
Ain't no tellin' what I'm gonna do next when I'm feeling your body
But I'll give it to you satisfaction, baby, let's get naughty

Repeat Chorus</pre>
