[Intro: KRS-One]
Yeah, let's get into this
The question is what do you love?
Heh, really
Like what do you really love?
Watch this

[KRS-One]
Here's what I'm about (love) you know what it's about (love)
Time for a different route (love) hip-hop we live it our (love)
Breakin emceein graf writin deejayin, no we not playin
This is (love), we live above
them guns and them drugs (it's love) ballers and thugs (it's love)
Never no hate, only debatin the gates of love
Never makin you wait for love, by flowin and showin the love
And if there is none we are creatin the love
Never mistake the love for lust
Create your love and trust I demonstrate the light of the love in us
Spiritual love, physical love, lyrical love
The miracle of, unconditional, mystical love
If you ain't got no love in your heart, how you livin?
How you movin, what you givin? What you provin, when you spittin?
Is it hate, or is it love? Whether you love money or heaven above
It's all love, what do you love? I love YOU!!

[Chorus: Non-Stop] + (KRS)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
It's for the love, it's only for the love y'all
YOU, yeah
It's for the love, I thank you for the love
(I love YOU!) Yeah (all the people that came to the shows)
This for the love, we thank you for the love
(I love YOU! Yeah, remember)
It's all love, we thank you for the love

[KRS-One]
Bringin back L-O-V-E, I rap and I emcee
I love what I do, if I ain't doin it I feel empty
I get love, and give back this love when I spit rap
But when I emcee, it's like a universal chit-chat
I live what, the love in my heart, the love of my art
The love I felt in eighty-six, at my first start
Rippin rappers apart, for the love of the art
Yeah the money was part of it but not the start of it
I got the spark in the dark in the park as a kid
To bark bark on the mic every night is a gig
When I finally did my thousandth show, and became a pro
and saw the real record business, I said OH
I think it's time to go y'know there's no more love y'know
Cats just rap for the cash, pushin and shovin they bro
Therefore I flow my flow, I fear no one toe to toe
I rock shows, but y'all know, I love YOU!

[Chorus: Non-Stop] + (KRS)
Yeah, yeah (for alla y'all)
It's for the love, we thank you for the love y'all
(I love YOU!!) Yeah (Alla y'all that be comin to the shows)
It's for the love, it's all love y'all
(I love YOU!) Yeah (Buying KRS shit)
It's for the love, we thank you for the love y'all
(I love YOU! Yeah, word up)
It's all love, it's all love y'all

[KRS-One]

[Chorus: Non-Stop] + (KRS)
