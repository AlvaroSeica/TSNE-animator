[Hook - 2x]
The world may spin, the sun may shine
Get it how you live, or get it how you die
You can live for the future, or you can dwell on the past
But long as I'm around, I'ma mash for my ca-ash

[Dougie D]
The world spins, 365 times
360 of em, Dougie on grind
Massaging my mind, with the cattle stannous with pine
24/7, pushing and pumping to get mine
I ain't never fin to quit, I ain't finna stop for shit
Get rich or I die trying, my intent when I ride bitch
Motherfuckers is scheming and plotting, wanna see me fall
Or do to the game, that I'm equipped with and managed to ball
Hating niggaz suck dick, hating bitches suck dick
Fuck every last one of you bitches, and Dougie said this
Living my life for the future, can't go on stressing the past
All the wild adventures happened, have me Dougie a man
Now I'm standing six feet, sitting 2-15
With a click of guerillas, and a arsenal weaponry
Ready for war on you bitches, Deegie bitches is smashing on all haters
Cut throat nigga, when it's all about my paper

[Hook - 2x]

[Dougie D]
The only thing I know up in my life, is go hard
And facing your contributions, determines your reward
The time that we living, is a recycle of life
The shit that you see in your life, once you might see it twice
So I keep on pursuing my paper, packing this pump
Niggaz is facing and flinching, feeling froggy to jump
Got no time for procrastination, conscience holding me up
The only thing that I see, is dolla-dolla buck-buck
Give it to me bitch what, I'm a G and I'm mashing at all cause
Only thing that I got, is my word and my balls
People that prosecute me, niggaz that want me red
When it comes to my dollas will I mash, bitch bet
