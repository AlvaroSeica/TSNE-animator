[Pro the Leader]
(Cold American Beach) Yeah (this is for the Cold American Beach) Yeah (Gat
celestial missile toe) Yeah
You best back off me before I make you my next offering to God
Hip-Hop made me an offer that I couldn't refuse
And while you're concerned with the battle it's the war I won't lose
Chose which style should I use, there's too many choices to make
Like who's the next opponent that I'm going to have to eliminate
I'm sick of people everyday trying to get loud and hold conversations on
things they know nothing about
Word too many, situations rise in a curve like who's the next shit mouth
that I'm going to have to face
Or raps place you in Fidel Wraps in an intricate maze
Yo, YOU DON'T KNOW NOTHING ABOUT ME,
CRACKS FACTORY, PRO'S LABORATORY, CHILLIN WITH ALCATRAZ B.
I'll rip off all your limbs; piss down your throat (grimy), STOMP YOU OUT
IN NEW TIMBS...

[Holocaust]
Nightmare violent, Alcatraz Jig-Saw Puzzle
Elite group of warriors like a gathered army of scientists
Onslaught appliances, look up the word mayhem
We came to slay men, ?leave them in caves den?
Technique is flat hat, and you bitches is bi-proxy
Rappers is cabbage heads, in five New York burrows to Caballero
By means of by hook or by crook, ?I call all it?
Rappers mutilating cadavers, yeah my mossy jerk calendars
I rest with caliber, and many noble man, skull, skull
Callus in a calamitous ch-callus
Call off my call girl calligraphy, Enlistment fucks up your physical education
School of assassination, like that first Mason, like that first Mason
Lyrics calculate calculatings in enumerative death calculations, like a
cereal killing fucking calculus calculator
Grey Asia, Asian plumb, Fiji Water, like Chinese Fist Boxing
Poetry audimator, the reanimater, Wu-Tang exorcist, perfectionist
By hand or hollow tip to burry or parliamentary, old legend of Dead Horse fist boxing
Enhance Holocaust, bomb a koala... props, bomb a koala props
The shy is high; the clouds are low, slow hand death blow
Rhyme wrecker book... gun wrecker book, take a second look
I leave crews subdued, spark in the dark Martial Arts
Master piece maverick, narrow minded maximum
Veteran mass produce massacre, poetry poltergeist Wu-Tang medicine book
Intelligent crooks

[Pro the Leader]
YEAH, YO catch me rapping from my camouflage helicopter
Don't get caught in my propeller blade, renegade assassin
Slit your throat because I think its time for some action
Hardcore start a verbal brutal murder attack, missile launcher on the back led
Loose your crew, is no longer in tact, dis-attach body parts, dismemberment
Pain and suffering is all your soul is going to remember when I return you to the essence
No ones going to reminisce on you're pissed on carcass
This made heartless, don't fuck around with the real artists
I'm here to teach you cowards a lesson
Trying to send me a letter, but I burn up your subliminal messages
AK-47s extra long banana clips
Murder all you fuckers, now I'm in a bunker blood drenched
Reaching down in my muddy Timbos, blazing white widow
Metamorphosize in to Windigo

[Holocaust]
This is pacificatory ice death, cost Los Angeles, Tokyo opium
Alcatraz yo, he's bravado ???? in a house with Polio,
Condemn sentence pistol, rhymes is bizarre twisted and uniquely imaginative
Alcatraz with a war gun, smashing the boundaries of western animation
Mic greave breath, a graphic life force in the poor world of happily
Japanese assassination
Like old man Jason, them Tasmanian wolves and thems up to no good
Rap tyrants in nocturnal environments, move with Charles Bronson heat, Don Johnson sheet
Yeah, the best towel on the beach up in a sweet geek, the best towel on the beach up in a sweet...
Perfect blue boots get spun, great monkey wants his gun, old man get hung
Slumped in a hallway, bloody lung, cough, bloody lung, bloody lung, bloody lung
Bong revolver, fish roses, furnace motor explosives
It would be a mistake to however to savage approach this, united ammunition takes focus
Child ill knock your smile out, leave you skull broken, buonas noches
Empty Alcatraz wrote this, he moves slow like a tortoise, he's bullied like Borrus
Gummy sandwich chicks like a ????, like a ????
The Candy Cain koala, him ?victoria? Alcatraz ghost stories yo, drinking in the house with Polio
Bitch watch this six digit zipper head
