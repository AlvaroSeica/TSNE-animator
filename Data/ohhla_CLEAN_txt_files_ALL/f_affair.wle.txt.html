Yeah, this shit got me feelin Robert Beck
Rather than Robin Thicke, hoes got a list but I gotta pick
I'm gettin bitches to strip
Leave all they clothes on, baby this ain't so hard
See, I'm a nigga with no flaw
No wrinkles in my game, this is Botox
And spoke of, I make them hoes strip
But keep on your clothes, leave your inhibitions here though
I breed 'em like I'm goin to war
I turn 'em killers, they ain't figure what they fightin for
This is your Vietnam, via my strength
See your arms can't reach me, believe me I'ma be your God
See, involvin yourself is to be a part
And when you clockin for the night, you don't need a heart
...You now on the premises
Where rules get followed, my pretty words stalk ya
Once guarded like the jail assistant
But now in-visible cells surround your brain, it's much different
It's much stricter, believe me
And even when you crabby, obey all seasons
Whatever issues you have, now speak them
Anything you need, now you gotta come to ME for it
Squeeze you tight, forever you my bottom bitch
And not a fear as long as you know who yo' father is
...call me Daddy

[Chorus]
(Me?) Cause you love me
(Why me?) Because you need me
(Why me?) You need to breathe me
(Why me?) Cause I'm your family, you're too weak to leave me
(Me?) Cause you love me
(Why me?) Because you need me
(Why me?) You need to breathe me
(Why me?) Cause I'm family, you're too weak to leave me

[Wale]
I'm more Karrine Steffans, than Corinne Rae
I see the honesty, he told me that he needs me
..You see he loves me cause he beats me
Because he kiss ev'ry wound that he leaves me
From the womb, my newborn child
Although the route's foul, we need Similac powder
Hold on... simmer down now
See momma's new job that provides temporary housing
...And I'm sorry that I brung
you to the world, see your father's in the clouds
And daddy's in the Cadillac, I better get my gown
I'm running out of time, thirty Xs' on that calendar
..You see I gotta go to war
You too young and you don't know what I'm fightin for
This is my Vietnam, you are my strength
And the reason that I'm going, see with you I never see it wrong
So I'ma leave you with the sitter
And ev'ry time I spread 'em, I'm dreaming 'bout us with millions
See me with a husband, no government assistance
Turn my back on the game and I ain't never gon' miss it
I kiss you on the forehead, baby just listen
Times I ain't with ya, know I am still with ya
Forever I am with ya and never should you tear
And never should you fear knowin momma's right here

[Chorus]
(Me?) Cause I love you
(Why me?) Because I need you
(Why me?) Right now, we need him
(Why me?) Cause he family, we too weak to leave him
(Me?) Cause I love you
(Why me?) Because I need you
(Why me?) Right now, we need him
(Why me?) Cause he family, we too weak to leave him

[Wale]
You got me feelin orphan Annie, more or less..
..than the muse of a family
Shit, is it money that my momma want?
Or is it somethin deeper, and this is momma front?
I know my daddy gone, it's such a lonely world
Is this the reason for you leavin? Do he feel a void?
Do he make you feel important than how you felt before?
Do he kiss you on the forehead and keep you warm?
Shit, if I was old enough to speak
I'd tell you that no money can be a mother to me
...And you ain't gotta go to war
Especially if you don't know what you fightin for
You stuck in Vietnam, you see him as a God
And I don't know who told you, but I don't see a mom
I see a young teen that don't see a problem
We're livin' wrong for your Garciaparra
Your little cub, one day a bed
One parent above, the other live scared
She need love, that's why I can't have it
She can't be my mother, she's always with daddy 

[Chorus]
(Me?) You don't love me
(Why me?) And you don't need me
(Why me?) This ain't easy
(Why me?) I got no family, you too weak to leave him
(Me?) You don't love me
(Why me?) And you don't need me
(Why me?) This ain't easy
(Why me?) Momma, we got no family, cause you too weak to leave him!

(Me? Why me?)</pre>
