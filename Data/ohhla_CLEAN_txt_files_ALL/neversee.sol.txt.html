[Intro: Solomon Childs]
Uhh, You know, I do, I swear I do, (Childs)
I just wanted to let you know, (Alicia Keys) That's right

[Solomon Childs]
I guess you heard overnight how I'm becoming a star
And now you think I got them other chicks in my car
And I know you'd never believe you and a street dude would stare at the moon
Been on the road too long, I'm coming home soon
My tender lover, My Mrs. Undercover
Aint nothing like snuggling with you under the covers
Tattoos on your thighs, We've been date'n for a while
And it's funny how I still get caught in your smile

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
Every time you hold me
Hold me like this is the last time
Every time you kiss me
Kiss me like youll never see me again
Every time you touch me
Touch me like this is the last time
Promise that youll love me
Love me like youll never see me again

[Solomon Childs]
See your conversation is immaculate, Wardrobes for every event
That's why the time we share together is well spent
And love it when you fall asleep on my clothes, Cause I cherish your fragrance
On my myspace page you leave the best comments
So if there's anything you feel that can hurt our love affair, Inform me
So I can do my best to prevent, Compliment with Heaven sent, Word

[Alicia Keys]
When I wake up in the morning, Your beside me
I'm so thankful that I found everything that I've been looking for
I dont wanna forget the present is a gift
And I dont wanna take for granted the time you may have here with me
Cause Lord only knows another day is not really guaranteed

[Chorus]

[Outro: Solomon Childs w/ Alicia Keys vocalizing]
Listen, How bout we make a deal, You take care your self
Out here in these crazy streets, And I'ma take care myself
So that at the end of the night we can see each other
Hold each other, Talk to each other, Make each other smile
You know, Word</pre>
