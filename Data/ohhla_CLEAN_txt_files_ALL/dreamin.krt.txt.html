[Big K.R.I.T.]
Old school flow
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
They used to say
They used to say
This rap shit

[Chorus: 2X]
They used to say "he's dreamin'"
They used to say "he's dreamin'"
This rap shit "is not for real"
This rap shit "is not for real"

[Big K.R.I.T.]
Yeah, I remember it so clearly
Rapping to my pop about the cars and the clothes, shrimp and the lobster
that I heard about, like word of mouth
That UGK tape and Scarface will turn ya out
I was like thirteen, thirsting for a good beat
Scoping for a studio, talking bout I spit heat
like 'Ball and 'G, on that pimp tight shit
Three 6 had me crunk on that late night tip, they said

[Chorus: 2X]

[Big K.R.I.T.]
Yo, yo, yo, I played ball for a minute, did I mention? Wasn't in it
Writing rhymes on my glove so I will never forget 'em
Had to quit it, didn't feel it back in high school
Rather write poems, known for flowing, that's what I do
Couldn't be Little Zach forever, peace to my big brother
Follow ya dreams baby, that's word to my grandmother
Well I hit the streets, tapping out beats, kicking my flow
I overhear the same shit they always said befo', that he's

[Chorus: 2X]

[Big K.R.I.T.]
I told 'em call me K.R.I.T., they told me change my name
Don't be alarmed if you don't make it, that's just part of the game
Besides, I ain't rap about dope, nor did I sell it
I guess the story of a country boy just ain't compelling
A&amp;Rs searching for a hit, I just need a meal
Couldn't afford to pay the rent, but passed up on a deal
cause, it wasn't right, sometimes you gotta wade the storm
In a class of my own, but I was scared to raise my arm
like, this my dream, this my life, I'll sacrifice it all
except my soul, in the firm belief there is a God
watching out, when all the others used to doubt
felt my pain and pointed down and said, son your time is now
I think my grandma pulled some strings on the low
but that's between her and the Lord, I'll never know
For those that caught me in the Spin and Complex magazine
XXL, the Vibe and whatever in-between
It's safe to say that dreams come true I guess
Don't let nobody tell ya, try for yourself
Just know that I was once considered just a dreamer
but I paid my dues and turned so many doubters to believers

They used to say
They used to say
They used to say
They used to say
"He's dreamin'
 He's dreamin'
 Is not for real
 Is not for real"

[Outro]
"I don't care if it is a dream
 I've got to believe in something, my love
 What can I do? What have I got to lose?
 You know sometimes dreams do come true
 Might as well be a dream, dream, dream, dream"</pre>
