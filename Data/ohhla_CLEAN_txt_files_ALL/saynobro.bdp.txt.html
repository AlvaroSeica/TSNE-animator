[Intro]
Alert! Alert! Beware! Beware! (New York, Philadelphia)
Crack attack! Crack attack! (San Francisco)
Alert! Alert! Everyone! (L.A., San Diego)
Crack attack! Crack attack! (New Jersey)
Alert! Alert! Beware! Beware! (Brooklyn USA)

Crown, Ruler, Allah C King
CRACK that's exactly what this means
And to all the Gods in '86 who are impressed
You better sit RIGHT BACK, and listen to THIS!

Crack stay back, crack stay back, crack attack
I say the jumbo means Dumbo (I say the jumbo means Dumbo)

I say crack stay back, a crack stay back, crack attack
I say the dime is a waste of time (I say the dime is a waste of time)

[Verse One: KRS-One]
Young proud middle class, beware yet
Crack infiltratin and that you can bet
Now is it politics or lack of leadership
That has the young babies sellin their body for a hit
I say the dime is a waste of time (I say the dime is a waste of time)
Why don't you wake up girl, at your school
And get knowledge of yourself and the golden rule
Now woman don't you know, you're the queen of the earth
And your precious womb is the home of human birth
So don't sell your body for no crack or dirt
I say the jumbo means Dumbo (I say the jumbo means Dumbo)
You tell your mother a lie, just to get high
You talk about the sneakers that you didn't buy
Just to get a 50 to get high, this new affliction
Some people say, is worst of all
There are no barriers and everyone will fall
First it was heroin from Kennedy to Luther
So now they're in the streets just sellin hula hula
I say the jumbo means Dumbo (I say the jumbo means Dumbo)
I'm gonna break it down to ya if you don't know what I mean
I say crack's miseries been takin over the scene
You do this coke girl, now that's a brand new thing
And let's pray to God, and let us pray to God
And let us pray to God you don't get addicted to the scene
I say the jumbo means Dumbo (I say the jumbo means Dumbo)

Crack stay back, crack stay back... {*echoes*}

[1:00 long instrumental interlude]

[Verse Two - spoken word orator]
And a dime, is a waste of time
Young, proud, middle class, beware yet
Cause crack's an infiltration, you can bet
Is it politics or, a lack of leadership
Who really knows?
But after a blast of this stuff your soul mind and body goes
Crack stay back, jumbo means Dumbo, a DIME, is a waste of time
Even the upper class you must watch your set!
With this stuff you'll lose all your gains
You may even lose your jet
First, they gave us her-on, they called it boy
From Malcolm, John F. Kennedy, right through Martin Luther King
But now it's cocaine in crack form
Hey it's the same old thing
This new affliction's powerful y'all!
Some say it is worst of all
There are no barriers this time
With CRACK, everyone will fall
So what do you say now my young people?
Black, white, hispanic alike, what do you say now?
I say, stay BACK with your CRACK
I'm no Dumbo, keep your jumbo
I value my time, don't want to buy your silly dime
Cracks are the devil in a white disguise
Once, once you use them you are SURE to die!
I AM THE BROTHER WHO ON TV SAID
SAY NO YOUNG PEOPLE AND KEEP YOUR HEADS
SAY NO YOUNG PEOPLE, SAY NO

[repeat 2X]
Crack stay back, a crack stay back, crack attack
I say the dime is a waste of time
Crack stay back, crack stay back, crack attack
I say the jumbo means Dumbo</pre>
