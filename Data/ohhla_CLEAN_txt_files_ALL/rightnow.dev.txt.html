Once Upon the wings of love
I dashed up on the craft
wrinkled foreheads greet me, but I'm high therefore I laugh
attendants rush me, to check my bags
they said "hurry, cuz we 15 minutes behind
we have one seat left and its way in the back
it shouldnt be too hard to find, go sit down."
I said aiite bitch, but I said it kinda low
It won't no problem go towards the back I go
had a little weed on me didn't want it to show
some helicopter took my patna 3 months to grow
so, I slid to the rear to find my chair
Hey pretty girl is this my chair here?
the key Y) didn't even crack a smile
She smelt my black and Mild
she think I be actin wild
and she refused to move her purse
out the little little seat freak trying to get the dude to curse
wanted a nigga to rant and rave
just because of my color, thinkin I cant behave
I said, "Pardon me ma'am, excuse me miss
But there's no reason for you to be pissed
I done payed my dues, payed my bills and fees
Just wanna sit by the window here while I'm feeling the breeze" caise

(chorus)
Right now I feel so good that I
won't let nothin or nobody bring me down
cant wait until the pilot finally levitate
trying to find a way to feel just like this way everyday

Breezier, Breezier
Breezier, Breezier
Breezier, Breezier

Attendants walked the asles as if we were in some type of camp
I seen all my belongings, big and small things
disappearing underneath on ramp
man, I started feeling kinda wicked
should have never bought a ticket
put on my seat belt in case
we land in shit creek
I had to grit me teeth
but then things kinda felt in place
I couldnt wait, broke out my big bag
put it on the tray table
wheels start rolling, table wouldnt stay stable
Waiter walked up and said do you want a beer?
I said yeah, he got happy start doing a cheer
He gave a bag of nuts to the nigga next in line
Put on a gas mask and pointed to the exit sign
I'm checkin it odd, I'm feeling the breeze
and everybody on the plane lookin at me, cause

(Chorus)
Right now I feel so good that I
won't let nothin or nobody bring me down
cant wait until the pilot finally levitate
tryin to find a way to feel just like this everyday

Breezier, Breezier x3

The weather started getting rough
and the big ass plane shook
I started trippin, cause everybody was flippin and dippin
and even hiding pocket books from crooks
I'm like look
I know its kinda scary, its a long way down
you should have had your shit together when you was on the ground
aint no time for whining and crying about dying
cause when its your time, its your time, but right now I'm

(chorus)
feel so Right now I feel so good that I
won't let nothin or nobody bring me down
cant wait until the pilot finally levitate
trying to find a way to feel just like this everyday</pre>
