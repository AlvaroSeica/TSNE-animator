Typed by: Cno Evil

[Chorus 2X: Joe Mafia]
Who's that, moving that, talk that, walk that
Pull your car, nigga, where you heart at? Hit hardest
Honest about that, you stop me? Straight tragic
Your hoes can't relate to that, so why ask?

[Joe Mafia]
I wake up every day with a warface, last one sleep
First one up, sun down, to sun up
Nigga what up, meaning you eating or scrambling
Hoe keep on handling, get at me, your face need a lax
Take a toke of some dough, keep it moving
By all means, for cream, I stay up on the new shit
Don't get it confused, move units, we just music
Then it's this, ghetto fabulous, fuck it
Cats get clapped for this, cuz ain't built to last in this
I break my foot in your ass for this
I'm on a misson that'll have you missing, in action
And ain't laughing, I'm dead serious with this
Niggas better recognize, sending with ties
I do bullshit for kicks, nigga, respect mine
Fuck around get sprayed up with a tech nine
Thinking shit sweet, muthafuckas better have they heat, heat

[Chorus 2X]

[Joe Mafia]
Wild blocks with a business like they own me, you don't know me
Stay the fuck out my way, just for my dead homies
I wreck these young restless, young hope for the dough
Whole big Smith and Wessons, secong guessing
Have you laid up in a po' lock, I zone on mics
Snatching up, cash crops, the last spot blown
Stay tucking the chrome, put one in your dome
For fronting, nigga, if it's on, it's on
Stay stunting in the hood where you living at, settle that
Put a fireball in your fitted cap, go and tell that, that
It's Mafia, get it right, get busy like
Wallstreet tycoons, make moves, you play the bitch type
Talks of curve, serving the Magossi steeze
Stay ready, ain't gotta get ready, nigga please
You know like I know, get cheese, fuck hoes
It's Muzzle Toe, stick niggas up for what they owe

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
