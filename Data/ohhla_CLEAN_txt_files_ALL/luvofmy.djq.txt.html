[Intro]
I'm lookin for the love of my life {*echoes*}
What I'm drinkin on?

[Chorus: DJ Quik]
I'm lookin for the love of my life
Lil' drank, lil' stank, that's the love of my life (Not me) 
Not lookin for a hussy tryin to be my wife
Say I'm lookin for the cash, that's the love of my life (You be)
I'm lookin for the love of my life
Lil' drank, lil' stank, that's the love of my life
Not lookin for a broad tryin to be my wife
Say I'm lookin for a whi[, that's the love of my life

[DJ Quik]
Now with a driver I can drink like I'm Halterbach
Martini glass filling, that's off the top
Don't like the talk shop, I'd rather shop and talk
I treat the tags like I treat them clubs, pop 'em off
A lot of players got the game distorted
If you have to ask how much it cost, you can't afford it
Plain and simple cut and dry, right to the chase
Cause sometimes you gotta put them ig-ums in they place
Everybody cain't make it to the pros
Some rise to the top, others down low
Some ride in the drops, others just stroll
That's the way the water flows if it ain't froze
Look at the brain on the man quick as the dame
Get the game from my mind to the pen through my hand
And to the streets from the speakers to the mic
That's why I'm so materialistic, I'm tryna buy the love, right?

[Chorus]

[DJ Quik]
Panamera Porsche, Maserati copy-painted
Diamonds from Chris Aire, too awesome, ain't it?
Middle finger in the air for the disses
And Tiffany jewelry for the misses
Orange bottle champagne tilt green blue
Clicko and Dom Perignon, weed too
Turn the music up so loud it bleed through
The BANG OUT~! That's exactly what he do
He get his style from the city of Compton
Fuck the doorbell, he get to knockin on something
Whip out on these haters, get to B-B-BLOCKIN on something
Take my girl home and get to lockin on somethin or somethin
Yeah, that's my ghetto mentality
I made it reality and it made me a salary
So I know just why you haters so mad at me
My life is a strategy while your life is a tragedy
So I'm lookin...

[Chorus]

[Gift Reynolds]
I'm lookin for the new love in my life
Benz CL6, skin all tan 
and with the insides, color of beach sand 
It's such a beautiful sight Just like Amber Rose
The way she sits at the light, hit a pose
I let her pause for the cause, camera shows
50K watch just so the cheers go
Jewlery game bananas, so they go apes
I'm makin love to the money like a sex tape
I travel onward, on to the next state
Now get that big cake, but no wedding date
I'm so hood rich, and love to cash out
And tear malls down, yeah spaz out
And throw it in the bags, and bring bags out
Full throttle whips, yeah smash out
New estates on my house, got another house
I-got-it-made money

[Chorus]</pre>
