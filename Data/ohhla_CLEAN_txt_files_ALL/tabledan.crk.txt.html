So here's on little question that I'd like to ask...
  
(Rap beat starts)
  
(Chorus: Repeat x4)
CAN A NIGGA GET A TABLE DANCE!!!
SHAKE IT UP! SHAKE IT UP! WOO! SHAKE THAT THANG!

[Maestro]  
I been workin' for a week, here's the money I got
I'm lookin' for a place to bust this nut
I'm attendin' in my benzo
Lookin' for a place to find some mackin' hoes
But that shit don't thrill me
So I head out to the mad city to get it on, G
Out the benz, I'm lookin' for fun
I'm lookin' for a place that gonna move some (echo)
Know what I'm sayin', know what I'm talkin' about?
I'm lookin' for a bitch that can turn the party out
I met a bitch named Dynasty,
Wit so much back, she made a blind man see.
What's really happenin'?
Too many clothes, not enough booty slappin'
Now I don't need romance, all I need to know is
  
(Chorus: Repeat x2)
CAN A NIGGA GET A TABLE DANCE!!!
SHAKE IT UP! SHAKE IT UP! WOO! SHAKE THAT THANG!
  
(Gong Sound)

[Stripper]
