(*talking*) 
Grrrrrrr...turn the track up, turn the mic up 
Yeah, what you bout to witness it's the Vault baby 
Do it now nigga come on, do it now nigga 

[Chorus - 2x] 
We gives you, exactly what you want 
And exactly what you need, all you gotta do is thug when we 

[Magic] 
I pop bottles, and I fuck models 
And the way I dress, you'd think I done hit the lotto 
So I keeps a magazine, filled up with hollows 
And don't date a bitch, unless I heard mami swallowing 
I got a following 
A bunch of thug niggaz in the hood hollering, (9th Ward) 
I moves with power, I'll have a flight of niggaz here within a hour 
To, bring out the coward 
In these so called gangsters, yank ya 
Up out your mama house and stank ya, uh-huh 
I put a nigga in a bad situation 
Bullets chasing ya, your heart's racing 
Shell casings, falling to the concrete 
I really doubt it, if you hear another heartbeat 
I embrace the block, like I embrace a glock 
Off top, I'm in the hood screaming fuck a cop 
9th Ward nigga, get it right 
If you don't get it right, me and my niggaz might fight tonight 
You ain't ready for combat 
You talk real good, but me and my niggaz bout that 
M16's with night beams 
You still carry pistols, and we strapped like the fucking Marines 
You know my background, you know my area 
So don't question my character 

[Chorus - 2x] 

[Trouble] 
Cherish my lyrics like the last supper, swallow them bones 
You burning up in weed smoke, follow you home 
Give me your love we hard, hustle for like we grind 
Thug niggaz, you can't help but be in love with mine 
Given the limelight, sender to the broke and blind 
Lost and found niggaz, heaven ain't that hard to find 
It's destiny, here's proof till the roof come off 
This where I get up in that ass, till the truth come out 
We stretch for loot stacks, so high it don't spend 
Possessing what's on the game, in time we don't bend 
My kind genuine, rock and still it don't bend 
Take a look what we got in the vault, you can't win 
Drawing blood, till the sunshine 
Speak every line, like we only getting one rhyme 
Come for the crowd I got mo' than just a point to prove, pay me in pain fool 
I ain't got a thang to lose 
So bare witness to the cross till it's lost behind, get unattached 
We strong arm first in line, send up a prayer for me 
Money make the world go round, turn up the mic for me 
Trouble make the world slow down... 

(*talking*) 
Trouble, don't go nowhere shaggy 
I don't think they heard ya, talk that shit to em ya heard</pre>
