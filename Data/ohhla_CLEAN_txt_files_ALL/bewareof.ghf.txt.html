Artist: Ghostface Killah f/ Venice Dawn
Album:  Adrian Younge presents Twelve Reasons to Die
Song:   Beware of the Stare
Typed by: Cno Evil

[Chorus: Saudia Mills]
He, spares, no, one
He was forgotten, but he was, someone
So beware of the stare of the Ghostface Killah
So beware of the stare of the Ghostface Killah

[Ghostface Killah]
Beware, son, I got the stare of Medusa
With the rope tied around your neck, it won't get looser
I might shoot cha, make your ass an example
You can't fuck with Tone Starks and not get trampled
Get hunted like a rat in the field, I hate rat
Hate fake ass niggas that love to set traps
Murder the Don, I'm back with a bird on my arm
Back to pillage, I rock a live grenade as a charm
I want bodies, DeLuca's, spread into the waters
I want mothers and sons, I wanna murder they daughters
Revenge, all I see is blood in my eyes
Like the rise of your worst nightmare, come alive
Ghostface Killah, let's see who's gonna survive

[Chorus: Saudia Mills]
He, spares, no, one
He's not forgotten, cuz he was, someone

[Ghostface Killah]
Yo, look away, don't stare into the eyes of a Killah
Metal lungies, junkies, nigga
I pack the nine millas and thrillas
Bulletproof robes and wave caps, revenge mode, nigga
You know Ghost gon' stay strapped, hunt 'em down
In alphabetical order, each person that cross me, watch the man slaughter
The butcher, the baker, the torture, the taker
I'mma send you right back to your maker
Few extra hoes, missing souls, sold to the devil
It's the rebirth of slick, brought back as a rebel
I'mma immortal, gonna kill generations of your fam
They try to melt my legacy away but I stand, stronger
GFK, the game pro longer

[Bridge: Saudia Mills]
He was a lonely man, they killed him
Cuz they didn't, understand
Well his spirit, possesses, a little
Cuz the words on this record, unleashes
The Ghostface Killah </pre>
