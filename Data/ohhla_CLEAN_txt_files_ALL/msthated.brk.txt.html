Album:  Rose Kartel Order
Song:   Most Hated
Typed by: DaSun Akbar

(Hook) Bloodthirst
The world most hated
Be about paper chasing law money, federal cases
The world most hated
Sex, money, murder
By any means homey we got to take it
The world most hated
Official with the gun plate
My Kartel can't be faded

[Nikki Bonds]
Is it my destiny to be a stick-up kid, rapping, selling crack &amp; weed?
Got your baby mama tied up in back of my V
I'm a gangsta with a capital G
Heard you're sitting on a half of ki
My dirty shot A-P blaze rapidly
I mass up dumping your whole faculty
Catch me in St. Valencia getting head from Daphne
Smoking indica, sipping Dackery
Jealousy and envy turn your best friend to your enemy
Money will tempt me
Run up in your crib and leave your safe empty
Squeeze trigger 'til the clip empty
Walking up and down this crib hugging the block
Haters telling the cops; me and my set got drugs on the block
That means somebody top gotta get popped
Kartel for life; you know how we rock
Don grimy, grimy, bitch from dirty DuMont

(Hook) Bloodthirst
The world most hated
The world most hated
Hated, hated, hated, hated...

[Baracus]
Why y'all niggas hating on us?
Like you faggot niggas don't know you'll get touched
See us hopping out of big, black trucks
Chromed out with the chrome out smacking niggas up
Lay on the floor nigga, give it up
Try to run my dunns, backing niggas up
Disrespecting my jukes, clapping niggas up
Be the role big gun style wrapping niggas up
Niggas know the Kartel bring bells
And we keep it popping, streets to the jails
Niggas kinda fucked up, right now
But as soon as we get right niggas getting nailed
Got the coke, crack, dope, and the weed
Tell me what you want, I'll tell you what you need
And we got these hoes down on their knees
'Cause they know the Kartel came up on some cheese
And we've been fucking, 2Gs
Shutting down the game for the 2G

(Hook) Bloodthirst
The world most hated
Be about paper chasing law money, federal cases
The world most hated
Be about the gun plate
My Kartel can't be faded
The world most hated
The world most hated
Hated, hated, hated, hated...

[Bloodthirst]
Man, the realest niggas you ever gon' meet
Real niggas we forever gon' eat
Love the way we move smooth with the vest and the heat
Left field niggas get lost left in the street
Got 'em hollering "Kartel off the meat"
Nothing soft and sweet, lift you off your feet
Moving unlawful deep in the Excursion, splurging
Stopping at the light, shitting in the Suburban and
I run with thugs that make niggas come up missing
Spot you on the corner, parked the whip and run up hitting
Same night book a flight to the fight shitting
In the 850, eye pearl, white dipping
Though three lays me, dopey, grimy and three dames
Starring at the world through my rear view in the speed lane
While y'all lame niggas pissing in ears
Know when we be the reason why you switched your careers
And them stinking ass hoes hating on a nigga
'Cause we got the Denali's into datings on a nigga
And y'all sideline niggas playing the fence
My M2 ace make niggas lay on the fence
Used to play the bench like it ain't made no sense
To them sherm heads by snitching they played those sense
Most hated

[Elohim]
Most hated I'ma bang 'til I drop
Won't stop 'til we pop
Won't stop 'til we get on top
Get situated; be about paper chasing
Duck taping, beating murder cases
My Kartel can't be faded
Infamous all the dangerous predicates
Uh-uh-uh, the world most hated
Everyday, all day, be about the trigger play
Every gun I tote gotta be chrome and nickel plated
Thug niggas, scheme drugs, still a dream
Bucky out beam, beam, beam, beam
And a whole lot of cash
Hydro, cocaine, gators, gold chains
Champaign's, and a whole lot of ass

(Hook) Bloodthirst
The world most hated
The world most hated
Be about paper chasing law money, federal cases
The world most hated
Sex, money, murder
By any means homey we got to take it
The world most hated
Be about the gun plate
My Kartel can't be faded
The world most hated
Be about paper chasing law money, federal cases
The world most hated
Sex, money, murder
By any means homey we got to take it
The world most hated
Be about the gun plate
My Kartel can't be faded
The world most hated
The world most hated
The world most hated
