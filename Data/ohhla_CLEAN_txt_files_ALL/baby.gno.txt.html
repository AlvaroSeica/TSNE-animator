I don't remember feeling like this..

[Magno]
It's Magnificent, the baby faced thug that you love
We cuddle and hug, I love it when I plug in your glove
You screaming my name, with each stroke you scratching my back
Plus you know I'm from the hood, so Mag packing a gat
We go together like fiends and rocks, screens and drops
I mash for the cash, until the green is got
I'm in the big body wide, cause you like the pick up
We fight and hit-hit Vinnies, and light Clarissa
Don't get it twisted, cause I don't trick for the cash
But it's a fact, that Mag never felt like this in the past
Anybody disrespect, they getting sprayed with the shells
Take the Benz, it ain't much for me pay for your nails
Make me melt, like the sun in the winter
You got rocks up on your wrist, and soo-soon you'll have one on your finger
It's like you paid the cost to book me, the Swisha House rookie
Been down from the start, I'd never switch my gal for nothing

(*Ashanti*)
I got this Jones, storming in my bones (from a man)
Who ain't need, took over my soul (understand)
I couldn't breathe, if her ever said (he would leave)
Get on my knees, till they bloody red (begging please)
See I don't know if you get it yet (just roll on)
He's like the lighter, to my cigarette (watch me smoke)
I'll never knew, another human life (even though)
Could have the power to take over mine, so baby

[Hook - 2x]
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Bay-baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
I love it-love it, when I hear your name
Got me saying

Bay-baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Bay-baby, baby, baby, baby, baby

(*Ashanti*)
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby

Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby</pre>
