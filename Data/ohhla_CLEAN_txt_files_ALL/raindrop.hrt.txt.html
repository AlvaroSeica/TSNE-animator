[Mr. Prezident]
Lord forgive me for my sins, but, we just trying to win
And we really need them ends
Know it might seem crazy, but, I just can't
Let the streets break me
Can't blame me, I'm, only what the streets made me
Seem lately, it's been crazy, I'm twist up
shit sucks, just lost two cousins in six months
My heart heavy cuz I'm holding in the pain
Feel like Orange Juice Jones when he was walking in the rain
It's strange when ya best friend, thought was your best man
Switch like a bitch, and turn, give you the left hand
Damn homey, thought, we was all fam, homey
Homey, seen the lane and he thought that he could tear it on me
Won't happen, get ya casket drop
Can't get shit by me, I'm like Shaq on the block
Keep that mac thing cocked, ya'll gone die misreable
Sitting around gossipping, just like the bitches do
Tell you what, when you see me, better get your tools
We getting physical, homey, the bare principal
I ain't got to say names, you know I'm spitting tool
Wrist that move, nah, the dog, yo, I'm invincible

[Chorus 2X: Mr. Prezident]
Rain drops fall down my face, it's hard to smile
When the black cloud follow you around
Rain please go away, come back another day
Life is rough, but there gotta be another way

[Fes Taylor]
Listen to rain drops, hopin the pain stops
You know I aim glocks, flame cops, change spots
The fame watch, take it like the blame I got
That's when I played the block, know my niggas make it hot
We lost Y. Million, P-Close took, AK slugs on the side of the building
Promise I will provide for your children
Honor my niggas lives, like, 9/11 died in the building
Who You? Know I ride for my building, I'm just building
Something, we could leave behind for our grandchildren
See, grandpops just passed, he was original gangster
From Lennox Ave., schooled me to getting cash
I say, our fathers, for my godfather
Look at my pops, same scars as my father
Say I follow the same path, go out in a blaze on the ave.
Think I'd rather die in a plane crash
Atleast I know my family's set, it's like my sanity left
Chambermusik G-Clef, hand me the check
I cash it with poppy, guns, I don't flash it with the paparazzi
Pull out hammers, you better pop me

[Chorus 4X]</pre>
