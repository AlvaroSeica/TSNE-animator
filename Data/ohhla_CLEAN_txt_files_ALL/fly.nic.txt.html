[Chorus: Rihanna]
I came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive
I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise
To flyyyyy-yyyyy-yyyyy-yyyyyyyyyyyy
To flyyyyy-yyyyy-yyyyy-yyyyyyyyyyyy

[Nicki Minaj]
Uhh, yo, yo
I wish today it would rain all day
Maybe that'll kinda make the pain go away
Tryin to forgive you for abandonin me
Prayin but I think I'm still an angel away
Angel away, yeah strange in a way
Maybe that is why I chase strangers away
They got they guns out aimin at me
But I become Neo when they aimin at me
Me, me, me against them
Me against enemies, me against friends
Somehow they both seem to become one
A sea full of sharks and they all smell blood
They start comin, and I start risin
Must be surprisin, I'm just surmisin
I win, thrive, soar, higher
Higher, higher, more, fire~!

[Chorus]

[Nicki Minaj]
Uhh, yo, yo
Everybody wanna try to box me in
Suffocatin every time it locks me in
Paintin they own pictures then they crop me in
But I will remain where the top begins
Cause I am not a word, I am not a line
I am not a girl that can ever be defined
I am not fly, I am levitation
I represent an entire generation
I hear the criticism loud and clear
That is how I know that the time is near
See we become alive in the time of fear
And I ain't got no motherfuckin time to spare
Cry my eyes out for days upon days
Such a heavy burden placed upon me
But when you go hard your nay's become yay's
Yankee Stadium with Jay's and Kanye's

[Chorus]

[Nicki Minaj]
Get ready for it {*3X*}
I came to win
Get ready for it {*3X*}
I came to win

[Chorus]</pre>
