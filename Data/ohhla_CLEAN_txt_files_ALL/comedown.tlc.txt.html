[Boz]
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
If you need a little tenderness
Can't find it no where else
If you want a little something sweet
You just come to me

If you're hungry for some love at night
I'll fix you up just right
There's a tender place just down the way
Where you can stay, and I'm sayin'

1 - 	Come on down
	Where the water tastes sweet
	Dive into my ocean
	Bring your love to me
	Come on down (come on down)
	Where the lovin' feels right
	Door is always open
	Open all night, come down 

Baby won't you come on down

[Boz]
I can take you where you need to go
Take you there nice and slow
To a place where feelings run so deep
You just run to me

I can lead you to a special kiss
Fulfill your every wish
There's a place I know just down the road
Where you should go, and I'm sayin'

Repeat 1

Baby won't you come on down

[Boz]
Oooooh
I can take you to where 
The love flows like wine (yeah, yeah)
I can show you my
Deepest secrets inside (yeah, yeah)
And you canc take a chance where I wanna be
So come here and get close
And baby gimme what I need the most
(Come come down)

[Boz &amp; Chilli]
If you need a little tenderness
Can't find it nowhere else
If you want a little something sweet
You just come to me

If you're hungry for some love at night
I'll fix you up just right
There's a tender place just down the way
Where you can stay, and I'm sayin'

Repeat 1

Come down
Come to my ocean baby
Come down
Where the water feels feels so right
Come down
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Come down
It feels all right

All you gotta do is come to me
Oh baby, baby come down on me
Where the water, water tastes so sweet
Just come to me, come to me
Alluring me, come on down</pre>
