[Chorus: Big K.R.I.T. and Ashton Jones]
Cause we could be
Kings and queens, and highs and lows
And wires and vogues, and anythang that goes
And together we, are closest
It was meant to be, you're chosen
The best, I know, I know
Cause we go good together baby
Cause we go good together baby
Cause we go good together baby
Cause we go good together baby
Cause we go good together

[Big K.R.I.T.]
I'm talkin early morning fresh 
Get up, get out and get, gone
Thank God for the sun, and the, chrome
That I pushed when we rolled
in that Brougham or Fleetwood 'Lac DeVille
Goosebumps trunk, yeah it gave ya chills
Popped up twice just to show ya grill
Left the comfort of her home to roll with me
Cause she was searchin for something real
I be that nigga, be that fresh
Leave that lame, be with a winner, relieve that stress
Jump online, I free your mind
We don't need no dimes, at least not mine, spend this check
Buy that Benz, or ride that Lex 
and drape our necks like kings and queens
Cause if you down to shine, I make love to your fertile mind
'til you conceive my dreams

[Chorus]

[Big K.R.I.T.]
Lemme be your one-stop shop
Fill you up when you on E
Pick you up when you want feet
Be yo' guide, I be yo' eyes when you cain't see 
I be yo' air when you cain't breathe
I give you game but it ain't free
You gotta be down for the play
When we up, we can shine, but prepare for the grind
Cause the 'Lac could break down any day
Would you be willin to hit licks?
I ain't the type to boast and nitpick
But it takes some hard work to get rich
It's a small risk to rock the Red Bottoms and bop the fresh fits
What you want, what you need
Gotta have, when we shop, gotta grab
Never hear, put 'em back, in fact
Just be careful how you spend yo' cash

[Chorus]

[Bridge: Ashton Jones and Big K.R.I.T.]
Just like highs and lows
Sub-woofers and vogues
We go good together, baby
We go good together, baby
Just like wires and vogues
Neon trunks that glow
We go good together, baby
We go good together, baby

[Chorus]

[Outro: Miya Bailey]
Enjoy the fruits of your labor, the spoils of war
There's no home in indulging
in the things that life has to offer
There comes a time in every king's life
where the wine flows in abundance
and the tables are set, feast and be thankful</pre>
