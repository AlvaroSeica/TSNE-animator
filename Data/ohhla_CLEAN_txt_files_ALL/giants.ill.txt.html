[Ill Bill]
Live at Giants Stadium with Ghostface &amp; Van Halen
Cypress Hill &amp; AC/DC too
Sarah Palin is a Wu-Tang fan, she was chillin with Diddy
During +Motherless Child+ she wild out and showed us her titties
Sign of the black mark, digital triple six cash cards
Devils clashin with Ansaars, bitches grabbing they tampons
I have to thank God for the places he put me
or rather for hip-hop, and the places it took me
Aim at the game, hit the scoreboard with the sawed-off, the warlord
Tryin to recite what I write, could cause your jaw to fall off
Flow is unique speak to the people, my flow is the street
Words are the traffic lights and my soul is the beat
My discipline is like walkin on hot coals with the feet
My confidence is like what you feel when you holdin the heat
But you don't need ratchets to validate the fact that you great
But watch your mouth, I'm old school, you'll get cracked in the face
In Farragut Road, trapped in the cold
My fingers numb from baggin up coke, stranded on the planet of chrome
In the jungle where the cannibals roam
Smashin with ratchets at your dome
Creepin up amongst assassins of the soul

[Q-Unique]
I'm a Brooklyn beast bringing honor amongst crooks and thieves
Fill the bong and let's cook these trees
Hear the words of a murder fanatic, blastin with the black ratchet
I'm a burner mechanic
I'm here with Howie's nephew, together we connectin the dots
We at Giants Stadium in the executive box
In the constellation of rappers I'm the top stars
+Superbad+, McLovin, shootin the cop's car
And yeah we all loadin the clip and feelin the heat
But nah y'all ain't killin the street like Ill and Unique
Spit venomous shit like a coiled snake king
and grab the cash in your safe behind the oil painting
Runnin through New York's major blocks blazing Glocks
And Decepticons lasers pop at Megan Fox
It's the Fox 5 Newsroom where my sanity dies
Cause I get more truth out of watchin Family Guy
The black Yankee fitted over the black doo rag
The black banana clip thrown in the black schoolbag
My memories of Lafayette High
when I walked between the Coney Island thugs and the Mafia ties</pre>
