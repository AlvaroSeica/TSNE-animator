Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus: x2]
Glo boy, I been with it since jump street
Right when we was selling D, right there on Front Street
You drunk bitch, why this bitch don't want me
I just had a six some, them hoes was acting country

Thots ugly cause that bitch say she love me
Cause I don't like the texting, I don't want no company
I dick her down she like 'Sosa you drugged me'
Told all her friends now them hoes wanna fuck me

[Verse]
Aye aye I'm bankroll shawty
I got so much money I bought a bitch to match my robbins
I'm king go shawty a nigga
Try and rob me he get brains blown shawty
I got 2 Glocks 40's
They both got 30's in it
Run up then you shot shawty
And all I ride is 'raris
But I just bought a Beemer truck
I'm sittin' on some 40's

I got the set with me
This shit ain't Aquafina but I got get wet with me
Bitch I got what you need
Is you gone suck my dick
And if you not you gotta leave
Cause I'm a cash count
Bitch I be high off that earth
She hit my weed, she passed out
I'm a laugh now I know this bitch I told you bitch
Can't stand me, sit yo ass down

[Chorus]</pre>
