[Intro]
"Astrology, mysterious science of the stars
 The science of life itself, fascinating stories of life
 I'd like to tell you a story..."

Aiyyo Chief Chinchilla
I seen you walkin down the block the other day with a 12 girl harem
And all 12 girls had different flavors of malt liquor
Whassup wit dat man?

[Chief Chinchilla]
That's called Zodiac Pimpin playboy
I got a Pisces, bitch same sign as me
An Aries I been fuckin since '93
I got a Taurus with teeth like a walrus
But she give head so it's fine with me
I got a Gemini, bitch see the king in I
I got a Cancer that lets me bust in her eye
I got a dancer, a Leo, ferocious in bed
when ee drink Zodiac 40-o's to the head
I got a Virgo but she get on my nerves yo
I got a Libra, this chick named Lisa
My Scorpio's broke so I duck the bitch
My Sagitarrius chick only get one gift
Christmas or birthday, one or the other
My Capricorn broad I got beef with her mother
My Aquarius is cute but queer
And all my hoes drink Zodiac beer, give it to me

[Chorus]
[G] Can I sip your Zodiac?
[C] Hell no hoe, go to the sto' with that
[G] Can I drink your Zodiac?
[C] Hell nah hoe, go to the sto' with that
[G] Can I sip your Zodiac?
[C] Shut up bitch~! Go to the sto' with that
[C] Can I drink your Zodiac?
[C] Hell, fuckin, nah!
[G] Pleeeeeeeeeeeease

[Chief Chinchilla]
I got a harem of 12 girls, 12 different malt liquors
One for every Zodiac (that's beautiful) knahmean?
That's called Zodiac Pimpin, and if you want a sip
