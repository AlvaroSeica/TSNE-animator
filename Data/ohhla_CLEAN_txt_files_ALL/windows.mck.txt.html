Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro]
I'm cruising, with my windows half down
Bruising, if he acting like a clown
Lose a nigga, if he doesn't wanna be found
If he go in that water, then make sure that he drown
I'm a shark nigga, I'm feeling like George, yea I'm a shark nigga
You's a dolphin, no you's a goldfish
I'm a shark nigga, yeah
Warrup nigga, to them sharks nigga

[Verse 1]
Yeah I'm hollin that sneaky diddy
I see you peepin me, I'm peepin him
Because we peepin this nigga that's next to us
Like he checkin us, like he bout jackin us
The cops on the corner, they got visions of hacking us
Who attackin us, you niggas claim you warriors
It's CMBMCMC you niggas don't want war with us
Warrup low jack, low jigga dick,
That's my nigga D fo shigaddy, get with me G
I know he straight from the dark side
Nigga that's the west coast,
If you don't get right you'll get left for
Warrup Birdman, see that's my uncle though
And he will punk you and spank you behind me, whoa
Warrup sugar slim, that's my uncle too
Some like my step pops, you'll get left, argh
Right on the block if you fuckin with us
Cause we don't play no games
You niggas is lame
Warrup Wayne, that's my brother
And we'll blues if you a clown
See we just cruising with the windows halfway down
Said lose a nigga, if he doesn't wanna be found
If he wanna come in the water
No life jacket, let him drown
Let him drown nigga
You's a goldfish,
Yea I'm a shark, I could spark in the dark
If I blast at your knees you can't walk
If I put a muzzle on you how you talk, speak nigga
Yeah speak up, I'm coming through your speakers
And nah I ain't fucking this song, I'm just chillin
I'm laid back, I owe you one, I put a check there
Signed by the x, cash and you pay back
G's up, hoes down niggas when we roll round
Blast shots at them, with a bit photon
If it's big then it might be a 7 pound
You 6 7 to 6 9
Nigga I got somethin' that's 4 7, with 2 letters
It's the motherfucking name, nigga, A to the K
You sure you wanna play, nigga this ain't recess
Yo mama she'll be stressed, sittin on a bench like it's recess
But no court, this a sport
You bitch ass niggas don't wann fuck with us
Nigga get your fork
Or better yet, switch your plate up if it's beef
Better become a veggie if it's beef

[Verse 2]
Bitch look, I'm cruising with the windows halfway down yea
Lose a nigga, if he doesn't wanna be found
Pussy nigga, come up in this water, you gonn drown
Y'all gonn fuck with the sharks
I'm feeling like a George nigga, I am a shark
And I'm coming to the shore, so I hope you ain't swimming
You might find a leg yeah they might find a limb missing
CMBCMC when we cruise nigga
You ain't gotta be the house for me to blues nigga
And nah, I ain't even know clues nigga
Know I'm not the DJ, and this ain't no relay
Get it the first time nigga, it ain't no replay
Type of nigga that ain't none of that he say, she say
See Birdman that's my motherfuckin nigga, he'll be hollin out
On you hoes
We come with nice clothes, might bust a lil gucci, might bust a dicky fit
Might get a nasty bitch, might get a quicky quick
You don't take too long as if we really don't wanna be in that thong
See we could smash a hoe for about 12 songs
See that's an album, that's just what we tell em
If this at school then you niggas we gonn fail em
If they go to jail we ain't the type that's gonn bail em
We just gonn cruise through the city with the windows halfway down
Lose a nigga, if he don't wanna be found
He could jump up in that water, and that nigga gonn drown
I say he jump up in that water, and that nigga gonn drown
Cause I'm a shark nigga
You's a dolphin, you's a goldfish
You ain't bout this and I know this
See this pistol yeah I hold this
See we still on some real nigga shit, we 100
You on some hoe shit.

[Outro]
