Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Unh
I always liked this song
Young Maejor
Chillin' in Jamaica
Sittin' on paper
Stuntin' on haters

Shorty you're my angel
You're my darlin' angel
Your picture upside down just for me, baby
Shorty you're my angel
You're my darlin' angel
Show me love, hit me up, that's all I need, baby

If you ain't know Michigan's were I growed up
My mama always told me that I would blow up
Now we gettin' in free when we show up
Every time we roll up, everybody know us
Life is one big party cause we so young
I get money, take trips, and it's so fun
Now I need me a girl for the long run
Yeah, I really want one
Don't wanna choose the wrong one

Shorty you're my angel
You're my darlin' angel
Your picture upside down just for me, baby
Shorty you're my angel
You're my darlin' angel
Show me love, hit me up, that's all I need, baby

Every time I look up I'm in a new state
And big rims on my truck feels so great
Some people come and say "What's up" but they so fake
Soon as I dip I already know they gon' hate
But it's really all good cause they girl don't
My songs make her feel good when the world don't
I won't stop until I'm poppin' on a world tour
And every girl gotta upside down photo

Shorty you're my angel
You're my darlin' angel
Your picture upside down just for me, baby
Shorty you're my angel
You're my darlin' angel
Show me love, hit me up, that's all I need, baby

Yo what up, guess I'm blowin' up, what can I say
It's the same Bei Maejor from back in the day
Only difference is my cars' in immaculate shape
And I gotta tell my rim quit actin' my age
When it comes to doing this I'm the jack of the trade
Makes beats, write songs, get stacks for a phrase
Got a pretty young thing way back in L.A.
Can't wait to touch down, lay back, and get laid
I'm representin' D-Town where the niggas don't play
Got love in the west, gotta crib in the A
Can't forget the east coast and they fast paced ways
All my people overseas or where ever you stay
Angel, you should get to know me
She like "How?"
Real simple baby girl listen take this down
3 1 3 2 4 2 triple 7 5
Wanna be my angel, hit me up right now
Unh, Maejor

Shorty you're my angel
You're my darlin' angel
Your picture upside down just for me, baby
Shorty you're my angel
You're my darlin' angel
Show me love, hit me up, that's all I need, baby
