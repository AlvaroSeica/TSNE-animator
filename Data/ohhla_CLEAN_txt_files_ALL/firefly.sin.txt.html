[Verse 1]
Yo, bear my black underbelly to the wind
I got an itch I can't scratch between my thorax and my abdomen
Lit my tail end with the fire to give us purpose
But I'm cursed by this short circuit below the surface
Nervous when I glow 'cause I always go dim
Like the breath of a torch light suffocating without oxygen
Wanna burn bright so the kids can catch a spark
Illuminate the space between grace and broken hearts
Inspire the human race to chase something set apart
The sky of firefly as I blow by to split the dark
But the spark fades and the blaze burns cold
Left most of the children with nothing to hold
Except the grip of what they thought they had caught
but came to doubt
I tried to firefly but in the end just flickered out
Six limbs, two wings, one vision to shine bright
But my city on the hill just spilled into the night

[Chorus] X 2
I wanna fill the sky with fire when I fly
Higher than the heavens just a twinkle in your eye
I walk the tight wire just to serve my own desire
I tried to firefly but in the end just flickered out

[Verse 2]
Escape the thin pocket of air beneath my Nikes
Might the night flicker bright to the beat of my wing flight
Or it might just not fall off the blown spot
Cat walk in the dark to the down beat
To the uprock quick to the don't stop
Talk love but spit hate
Don't do what I wanna do with every move I make
Cause I shake with my left and I take what I write
Speak life with my lips but then diss on the Mic
I'm swift to be angry but then I'm slow to be quiet
The trouble with the puddle of my life is double sided
So I struggle to keep the purpose of the lamp of my life lighted
Keep this lightening bug plugged with the Christ till I'm like-minded 
Till I burn with the fire than inspires the world-wided
And glide upon the spark of the sun till dark's blinded
And dart till dawn upon the lawn to be reminded
That our faith isn't gone but sometimes we can't find it

[Chorus] X 3</pre>
