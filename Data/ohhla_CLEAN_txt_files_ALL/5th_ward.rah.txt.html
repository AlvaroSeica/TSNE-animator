[ VERSE 1 ]
I'm one bad muthafucka out the Nickel
If a boy think he rough enough, then tell him just step
Cause other than the Nickel, I ain't seen a man rough enough
To do the shit the niggas out the Nickel do, yet
Like in the Nickel ain't a night without gunshots
9mm's and them Uzis ain't shit
You better be prepared to shoot a gang of muthafuckas
Cause them niggas out the Nickel just love to click
And fuck a pussy up until a pussy can't see straight
Hear straight, walk straight, do shit straight
And brothers out the Ward'll kill a man with the quickness
Drive through South Park, you need a jimmy jam-plate
What them boys know bout 5th Ward?

Huh, what them boys know bout 5th Ward?

[ VERSE 2 ]
A lot of ignorant muthafuckas out of 5th Ward'll
Deal with petty crime, and maybe snatch a bitch purse
You're probably sayin, "How you still livin to tell the story?"
When you live in the jungle, you learn to shoot a man first
And I'm a nigga quick to shoot a nigga when his guard's down
Fuck that other shit, let me regret it when I'm done
Fuckin with the beat, to tell the truth, is kinda dangerous
Cause ever since a kid I never really caught one
I learned to shoot, let go if muthafuckas triple-crossed me
Never trust a bitch and learned to juggle cocaine
Keep a nigga's ass off of Liberty and Waco
Cause that right there's a corner the hardrock claim
Now many say that they done come up out of 5th Ward
Mingled with the roughest, and the toughest, and the best
If ever there's a nigga who you think ain't out of 5th Ward
I'm a show you how you put his ass to a test
Ask him where he from, and if he stutter, he a lyin ass
Brothers out the Nickel don't forget where they from
Ain't a bitch that a 5th Ward man ain't fucked
Ain't a muthafuckin crime his ass ain't done
Anytime you see em, that's a set of ex-convicts
Who plan to go back in it anytime, it's just when
A.K.-47 in the trunk with a Magnum
Bitch, you better run, because your ass can't win
What them boys know bout 5th Ward?

[ VERSE 3 ]
Now everybody know that 5th Ward's where I come from
So I'ma show a 4th Ward nigga where it'is at
Anytime he ready for the war, come check me
I walk by myself, and I don't look over my back
Cause who and all your posse and your friends and your family
Ain't never gon' be ready for the wrath of the king
So you and all your dancers that you call your little lynch mob
Ain't even got no business with your ass in the ring
Now [name], that's my boy and I respect him like a brother
Anybody try to diss him, in some deep, deep shit
I'm the first muthafucka with a record out of Houston
And last muthafucka you should wanna fuck with
At heart I'm still a Geto Boy, trigger-happy nigga
With the love for 'making trouble', and the hate for a snitch
Known to take your money, take your life, and take your jewelry
So how you gonna play me when you look like you would bitch?
What them boys know bout 5th Ward?</pre>
