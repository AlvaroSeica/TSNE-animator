[Intro: Ice-T]
Yo, this shit got me bugging man
I'm looking at all these Hardcore motherfuckers; one year they got guns
and next year they're coming out with motherfucking damn stealths
Then I listened to some of these motherfucker's records;
They're acting like they done kill 300 motherfucking niggaz
They're still on the streets, and I'm supposed to believe that bullshit
What the fuck is up?!

[Verse One: Ice-T]
Niggaz got me bugging, in every rap they strap
Rolling Rag Top four, hitting switches and all that
You're lying, you ain't no Rap Star, you ain't got a car
You're whack, you're broke, a motherfucking joke
Stay the fuck out my face, kids, you don't know
You know my name, cause I beat down your homies
So what's up? - you want some more payback shit, back trap
You're only winning the fantasies inside your raps
Don't move motherfucker, best not twitch
I'll bust your homo spot, and then I'll fuck your bitch
Hardcore; no R&amp;B, Blues, no hooks singing
Begin to bleeding, niggaz be breeding
Hard shit, they rolled in and they believed that it's real
Hit the streets and get beat by shorties flexing with steel
I'm I-The Capital-C-E, you grew up wanna be me
Nigga, you can't see me, no fake
I'm iller than Jason up in Crystal Lake
FEDs take, every fucking move that my crew makes
Jail cells, my niggaz got mad years with Ls
Living hells, it happens often, tears and coughings

[Chorus: Ice-T]
Fuck that shit! - yo, I'm about to go off
The whole fucking Rap scenery is either fake or soft
So if you see me, nigga, don't shake my hand
Cause if you ain't Hardcore, then you ain't my man
Fuck that shit! - yo, I'm about to go off
The whole fucking Rap scenery is either fake or soft
So if you see me, bitch, don't shake my hand
Cause if you ain't Hardcore, then you ain't my man

[Verse Two: Ice-T]
You say you represent, but represent what though?
You say you're Hardcore, your shit sounds like disco
Damn steps, you're making me sick, can't watch the Box
If it ain't portiagraphy, it's bitches with glocks
Niggaz in Kansas lifted front and back
Niggaz singing sounding like war burnt of flak
Goddamn, give me the Boom-Baam beats and brace your killed-up face
Yo, break the takes, come lounge with the fool on the hell
Never faked a move in life, and never fucking with six albums
Living like concrete, every year I get harder, the riot starter
No need to overkill my raps with crap, I just kick facts
You hear the contact of the fat tracks
The choruses harder as they come
You feel the fat Airo-wave, drums boom, pock doom

[Chorus: Ice-T]

[Monologue: Ice-T]
Yeah, I make records for my motherfucking niggaz, not for your
motherfucking mother
I ain't with that weak whack ass R&amp;B BULLSHIT
Motherfuckers play on the radio everyday, FUCK that shit!!

[Verse Three: Ice-T]
Me and my crew be watching Evil Dead too
Sipping Kool-AidÂ® and brew, lacing the Disconnection Wu
Who can get enough of the ill stuff?
I got a motherfucking addiction to this shit
Like Court Fiction and beats like the shit I'm on
It's a bomb, a violence addict, like Nas I'm Illmatic
Lust for static, got my self, you better pad it
Mad erotic, fuck with this nigga you had it
Cause I'm all in, so what you're selling for Radio, whore?
You blow the DJ all day for Air-play
I got no love for niggaz who gave up the Hardcore for riches
Punk bitches!

[Chorus: Ice-T]

[Outro: Ice-T]
Yeah, you know who you are, you know who you are
You know who you are, Suck a dick!</pre>
