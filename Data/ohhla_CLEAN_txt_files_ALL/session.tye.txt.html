{WELL FUCK IT; IF YOU AIN'T GONNA FUCKIN SMOKE NIGGA}
{JUST, JUST RAP FOR US NIGGA} Aight I can hotbox it
Yo, yo, look

[Tyler, the Creator]
I'm Tyler Mr. Green Hat, pro-abortion anti-clean rap
Fuck your blog opinion and your feedback
My self-respect I leave that, in the lost and found
Wwere the black girls get theu weaves back; awesome I achieve that
Mini, blasting "You're a Jerk" in some fuckin yellow skinnies
looking like a fucking faggot!
Bouncing round the house trying to find an easy way to rape Minnie
Bet you thirty dollars you find her like Cartman found Kenny - dead
I like my girls smart, skinny, kinda Pop Tart
When I bite into 'em red
I'm a self-racist, you should tape this, ask Sarah, I'm the rapist
I'm a fascist, fuck fashion, Gucci belts is for them faggots
My hat is by Jabbia; if you got a fuckin problem
with the Future you can get a death wish just like Atiba
Fuck the biz apparent, Odd Future errant
I'm watching the baracks gettin head from someone's parent
Blind fuckin hate inside my heart, guaranteed
that I'm sharin in the force with the cyclops starin
I'm flyin on a beaver, you're a disbeliever
So don't ask for no motherfuckin ride when you see us
Swim right past you, the shit-list said that I'm nutty
such a cashew, cause I jack off with dish soap and smell gas fumes
Permanent brain damage similar to tattoos
The shit - you can mention me if anybody ask you
Kill the jungle let the cats loose
You didn't see me here if someone ask you

[Interlude]
That nigga got off! Hodgy Beats, haha
Hey, tell these niggaz

[Hodgy Beats]
I want to feel her in every way
Mary Jane keeps me high like every day
Bong, vaporizer, and the sack now
Stuck in my high, afraid of heights, I'm trapped
Buy a swisher for a dollar or two blunt wraps
Roll it up and ensure that everything's fat
She ain't got time to try and relieve ya
But she'll get all in your head, Sativa

[Interlude]
Ha ha~! Oh shit that's it?
Can't go no more? Yo, ayy
Ayy tell BranDun (to go)

[BranDun Deshay]
I'm good but y'all don't want me like vegetables
I'm all in front of you zeroes like decimals
Let's take them high like the decibels
So we get 'em high, get 'em high like cholesterol
In the overweight mother-lover, my tracks is filled with blubber
that's fat, who needs another producer?
Chicago get it from +Odd Future+
Used to ride solo vause I ain't really care what the rest say
Type of nigga to jerk off to his own sex tape
Best stay away when the door closed
I show up with four hoes
Best believe I'm leaving with more of those
And I got a girlfriend!
So I'm a keep lying until the verse end, end, yeah
Bran Deshay, Hodgy Beats, Ace the Creator
Odd Future, uhh
O.F. until, until
from now until forever, peace</pre>
