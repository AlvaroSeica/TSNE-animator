Song:   The Manual
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Travie McCoy]
They say anything is possible and life's just another obstacle
Well show me the manual, and the man responsible
Yeah, I went lookin for answers in the hospital and came back with a pocketfull
when I stole the manual, and killed the man responsible
Now we all make mistakes; but those mistakes just make us who we are
They're not who we choose to be (no)
My faith got misplaced; somewhere between a superstar {HEY}
And the boy that I used to be {HEY}

[Chorus: T-Pain]
I'm just tryin to be whoooo you say you are
But who are you?
I'm just tryin to be whoooo you say are the stars
and who is cool
But who am I? (Oh, oh, oh)
I'm the dude responsible
Hey, but who am I? (Oh, oh, oh)
Hey~! I'm the dude responsible... (hey!)

[Travie McCoy]
They say clothes don't make the man, but I'ma show you how fresh I am
Soon as I pay my water bill - and a couple other bills
They say they gotta cure for my smile, rather for my lack there of
So they gave me another pill, but it was just the water bill
You know we all make mistakes; but they just make us insecure
And a little uncomfortable
My faith got misplaced; between who I was before {HEY}
And the dude you think you know {HEY}

[Chorus]

[Young Cash] + (Travie) + {T-Pain}
Say! I can be in the hood sippin 'gnac with my boys
At the keg parties with them white boys
At the beach with the surfers in Beverly Hills
at a ex party with Vicks and light toys
I guess you can call me a chameleon
I adapt to any situation I'm in
And my momma ain't raise no fools
I'm just comfortable in the skin that I am in
(Now we all make mistakes)
{Yeah, I'm a walkin' contradiction and plus I never listen, ooh}
(And my faith got misplaced)
{Somewhere along the lines of, tryin to make my mind up, yeah - hey, hey}

[Chorus]</pre>
