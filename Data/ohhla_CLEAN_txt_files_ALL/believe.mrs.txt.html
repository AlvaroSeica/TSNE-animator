Don't play yourself, you know who this is, Lifetime Records ya heard

[Chorus 2X: Mr. Serv-On]
Believe me when I tell you boy we runnin this here
Believe me when I tell you fool we got this here
Believe me when I tell you yo city on lock
Believe me when I tell you we be freezin' yo block

[Mr. Serv-On]
Believe me when I tell you I be down for mines
Believe me when I tell you I be clickin them nines
Believe me when I tell you I don't talk to them boys
Believe me when I tell you I be servin them noise
Believe me when I tell you I be bangin them plaques
Believe me when I tell you I don't mess with no rats
Believe me when I tell you boo I like that there
Believe me when I tell you get it Ima hit that there fool
Believe me when I tell you I'm puffin on strong
Believe me when I tell you I be checkin them domes
Believe me when I tell you I'm shortin your breath
Believe me when I tell you by far I'm the best

[Chorus 2X]

[Blackwater]
Believe me when I tell you that Ketine gon' shine
Believe me when I tell you that this mic is mine
Believe me when I tell you that I'm bout my shit
Believe me when I tell you Ima handle my shit
Believe me when I tell you that I'm bout my cash
Believe me when I tell you that you gets no ass
Believe me when I tell you that my pockets be right
Believe me when I tell you that my wrists stay iced
Believe me when I tell you that my house is mine
Believe me when I tell you that I write my own rhymes
Believe me when I tell you that I'm bout what you not
Believe me when I tell you look chop or get chopped

[Chorus 2X]

[Blackwater]
Yo believe me when I tell you aint no little jacks on the block
Believe me when I tell you we be strappin them glocks
Believe me when I tell you I'm about that paper chase
Believe me when I tell you Ill put that nine in your face
Look believe me when I tell you we been six figures
Believe me when I tell you I'm a Lifetime killer
Believe me when I tell you we ride wit D
Look believe me when I tell you we put that ass to sleep
Just believe me when I tell you don't flash ya cash
Look believe me when I tell you get it out ya fast
Look believe me when I tell you better show us respect
Look believe me when I tell you Blackwater we next

[Chorus 3X]

[Mr. Serv-On]
