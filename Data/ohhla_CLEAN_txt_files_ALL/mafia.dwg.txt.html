[BRAZE MAC a.k.a B-BRAZY]
I couldn't wait to find Hawk so we can fuck this hoe
You know Braze got the hoe so many have to have jaw
In room nine cause it's gonna be a D.L. thang
You can't get in unless you claimin' Denver Mafia/Lane
To show your tatt' at the door niggas ain't bangin' ??
Or step to the curb and gettin' knock the fuck out
But this nigga that's gon' killas so gone his ass when I'm through
This is Lanes it don't stop, it don't quit, I thought you knew
I got the ?? pumpin' I like fuck
Pig tails, perm girls Braze khakis and Chucks
I be a nigga flue'd up should I kill it?
(Hell yeah - gotta with the gang I can roll ??)

[LIL' HAWK]
O.G. Inglewood back in the muthafuckin' door
Red Riding through your hood givin' up 104
With my dog B-Brazy
Rollin' in the Boupe
As everytime we swoop
We pull a: WOOP WOOP!
I got bitches that slangin' like each and every day
(But she can bangin' though)
C.M.G. for sure (West Side in the house!)
Oh, you didn't know?
Nigga, I'm Lil' muthafuckin' Hawkster
And nigga I ain't Africa I'm from Crenshaw Mafia
When I roll with Capone (and you know it's on)
And the J-U-N-E from the F.I. double G
And if I catch a Crab slippin', should I kill him? (hell yeah!)
Red Chucks on my feet, four braids in my head, nigga

I'm just bangin' Mafia/Lanin'
Do you wanna fuck with me?

[JUNE DAWG]
Surprise out of the cut, G'd up with my Chucks
Servin' cavi on the block is the way I can ?? (so what's up?)
I'm high off the chronic smoke
I'm down to blast any nigga that wanna come and provoke
So take a throw from a West Side Figueroa soldier
If I catch you slippin' hit you up and then I smoke ya
Flex back to my dog house with my G's
Pass saggin' to my knees one bitch's swingin' off the D's
So please I'm tick tockin'
Straight nina blockin'
On the dance floor and got a gang of hoes jockin'
I'm cluckin'
A major grip, down to set trip
Talk shit and get your first slip you just cannot fuck with
The young gangsta that be goin' toe to toe
Ready to scrap with any nigga representin' Figueroa
But now I'm kickin' down the door
With the infra-red beam
Glock-Glock on your dome lookin' the leather of much steam
With the genius, the quickness
I put them fools down
Shells drop on the gank blood spill by the pound
Bitch, you better watch you say to me
I straight get dope fiend by my nigga K.P.
A Ricket flue'd up, should I kill it? Hell yeah!
West Side Denver as we just done killed ya

I'm just bangin' Mafia/Lane and
Do you wanna fuck with me?

[LIL' HAWK &amp; BRAZE MAC a.k.a. B-BRAZY]
Mirror mirror on the wall
Who is the G is be a nigga off the mall?
Nigga you but nigga don't boost him Braze
I'm not, I just don't give a fuck about no Crabs
Nine block Lanes bitch my brain's mentally ill
Crabs watch your backs nigga at the light by ??
Blood it's the nigga named Braze, H.K. with the scope
Crab niggas wanna trip, Crab niggas get smoked
Snap crackle motherfuckin' pop
You Rice Crispy-ass niggas
Fool you know this killa
From the 4th to the 'Shaw even C.K. Century
And I'm still rollin' with the D.L.B.
Well it's anybody K fuck Boover, fuck ??
I gives a fuck what you claimin' if you ain't Mafia/Lanin'
Hoes swingin' off the nuts
Yep, but I can't stop ?? set up was Braze blood the hoes start jock
But since I'm Mafia/Lanin'
I'm entertaitin'
My niggas representin' be my niggas gangbangin'
I can't stop, won't stop, nigga I thought you knew
Lil' Hawk Red Riding and fuck a lil' boy in flue, Woop! Woop!

I'm just bangin' Mafia/Lanin'
Do you wanna fuck with me?</pre>
