Typed by: @QuezThePoet

And rumor has it
He came up out the womb a sonic boom and a match stick
Clenched between his teeth he lit it on his way out
It was his first fire spit it burned the roof of his mouth
And then the doctor said this boy's a Huey Neutron Bomb
But his mom she said nah, a Martin Luther King Kong
His daddy said he gon' spit that Slangston Hughes
And give these niggas the blues be bad news to crews
And when the people heard the news they all hit the avenue
In rejoice, a lot of them sparked blunts and cracked brews
And some commemorated this day with tattoos
That read "the Beatniq is here lets all go strait cashews"
They're calling him the blues, the funk, the jazz the rock n roll
They say his first steps conquered monster obstacles
And when he smiled he would glow it's like his soul glistened
The first word he spoke the whole world stopped to listen
He said

Follow the man with the mic in his hand
And he'll show you how to ge-ge-get down
He got a story to tell so everybody gather round
And by the way what they call him is the

Follow the man with the mic in his hand
And he'll show you how to ge-ge-get down

And they say he's out his mind out of sight outlandish out spoken
Outstanding outside the box get out foxed
By a rambling poet declaring all types shenanigans
On any Zapp Brannigan shitting on our future-rama
Plus they say he's quite the charmer
And he love his mama and he's worth the dollar
That you'll spend on an album or a show or book of poem
Go and throw him to the lions crucify him if you think he's slowing
Down the evolution of this hip hop art thang
Familiar face to many but his ways are arcane
He pull the heart strings like the long lost art came
From a past life and he's the re-incarnate
Stepping through the Stargate
To lands unknown his only weapon is a poem
His only message is to show em how to do it on their own
And if their leader's corrupt then it's their job to overthrow him

Follow the man with the mic in his hand
And he'll show you how to ge-ge-get down
He got a story to tell so everybody gather round
And by the way what they call him is the

Follow the man with the mic in his hand

And by the way what they call him is the

And they say that his death will be a glorious one
Although hero unsung a legend undone
A battle un-won but the struggles carried on
By the out casted youth with angst so very strong
And they do not know his name just his poems and songs
Face forgotten with the changing times but they hang his rhymes
On their picket signs death to those crossing picket lines
They say that wickedness is everywhere and sleeps in the divine
No wonder that his rhymes are said to be the source of crime
And to listen or quote equates to death and doing time
But they still bust the rhymes from a man who's now a myth
They call him Chupacabra not sure if he exists
But they still raise a fist computer chip in their wrist
Scratched off middle finger to the law like back off
And the moral is of course
That death can't even stop the man spittin' full force</pre>
