[Intro: Phonte]
When you wake up in the morning
I want to go to the mirror
and I want you to look yourself in the eyes and say, "FUCK - YOU!
Fuck your hopes, fuck your dreams
Fuck ALL the good that you thought life was gon' brang you
Now let's go out there and try to make this bitch happy"
New Tigallo New Tigallo New Tigallo New Tigallo

[Phonte]
Up early with the sun, and the stars 
6 a.m., ring the alarm
Weatherman say it's 90 today, but it's gon' feel like a hundred tomorrow
So throw some fresh water under the arms
Bullshit soon as I come in the job
Boss hit me with the news like a box-cutter under the jaw
Said they just had a meeting and I'm 'bout three hundred
Are y'all are gettin fired? 'Cause we been defunded
Can't say I didn't even see it coming
I always knew on one day 
They'd find a way to throw me to the wolves and once they 
came into my room on that Friday afternoon I was thinkin
"Why you faggot-ass niggas couldn't fire me on Monday?"
I know it's not sane, but yo I'm just sayin
Everybody prays for the day they see the light
but the light at the end of the tunnel is a train
$5 gas, and poverty rates 
are rising much higher than your hourly rates
So if you thinkin 'bout quittin, you should probably wait
'cause err'ybody gotta do a fuckin job that they hate
"Go and live out your dreams," that's what they tellin
Fam in my ear all day and they yellin
"Keep it real Tay and don't ever sellout"
But how the fuck you sell out when ain't nobody sellin?


[Chours]
Tired of playin wit' y'all
I wanna fight the good fight but it ain't payin me, dog
N.C. (MAKE YA MON-EY!) V.A. (MAKE YA MON-EY~!)
To my man still hustlin hard, tryna get it at whatever the cost
Wherever you at or whoever you are
That's me (MAKE YA MON-EY!) All day (MAKE YA MON-EY~!)

[Phonte]
It's like chasin a high, you just wanna get a hit
Just wanna get a taste, just want a benefit
Everyday you Wake up, there's the legitimate
Struggle between doin whats right, and just doin some nigga shit
Baby bro wrote me, say he feel he lost me
I'm like, "Dude I'm tryin, back the fuck up off me"
My single friends say "Tay, your family's beautiful"
I'm like, "If y'all niggas only knew what it cost me"
This shit don't come with no blueprints
and with every change it seems more like a game you could never win
I tell my peoples I ain't rich
but this harvest is the farthest from broke a nigga ever been
"Go and live out your dreams," that's what they tellin
Fam in my ear all day and they yellin
"Keep it real Tay and don't ever sellout"
But what the fuck is sellin out if ain't nobody sellin?
Shit..

[Chorus 2]
Tired of playin wit' y'all
I wanna fight the good fight but it ain't payin me, dog
N.C. (MAKE YA MON-EY!) V.A. (MAKE YA MON-EY~!)
To my man still hustlin hard, where you at or whoever you are
CoinStar pennies out of the jar, haha 
All day, nigga? (MAKE YA MON-EY!) Remember that shit? (MAKE YA MON-EY~!)</pre>
