[June Marx]
Manuever when its on, units are disarmed
Move thru the sewers diffusing a lit bomb
June in the fit form, ruthless, hit strong
Looming, intruding I ruin your sitcom
You and your clique gone, rugers inflict harm
Losers been warned,lose when the clip drawn
Cruise thru the shit storm,shoot and your limbs torn
Bruisin the foolish pursuing the list long
Rude when I hit chron, bars in a perfect scheme
Harsh as a murder scene,sharper than serpentine
Marxman, alert your team, vividly write
Caution, I burn regime trinity site
Gimmie the mic, agent administrate death
Waves of radiation incinerate flesh
I innovate the best,invest and surpass the norm
Still got my gasmask on, in babylon

[Hook  June Marx]
Its all or never, prepare for war in all weather
I lay low, catch me at the  bomb shelter
Raw as ever, arms in the storm cellar
Never surrender, catch me at the bomb shelter

[Lone Ninja]
Dooming your faction, they wounded in action
By hooligan's munition, bruiser gets fast win			
You're losing the match when we're dueling or wrasslin'
The brute aint disputing he shooting and stabbing		
Schooling you craftsmen a grueling assassin
Suited recruits they saluting the captain			
Ruthless with axes, Lone's the calm elder
Eluded the casket, roam in bomb shelter				
Harsh lessons your strengths weak, smart weapons
Detect heat, dark message when death speaks		
Form a staggered column, bomb the fascists, got em
I'm a slasher, armed attacker, yall gon' have a problem     			
Trauma's massive, awesome, I don't have decorum
I'm a master of disaster, I will clash in autumn
Got your sergeant major dodging lasers
Put your squad in danger for largest wager</pre>
