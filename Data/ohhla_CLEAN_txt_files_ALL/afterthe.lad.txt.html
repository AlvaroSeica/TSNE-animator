[Intro: female singer]
Ahhh-haaaaa... oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah.... yeeeeeeahh
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Ha ha ha ha ha
Oh oh oh oh...

[Chorus: male singer (female singer)]
Pass the Henny and XO
I'll say the word and we go
I want the 'dro and it's homegrown
(Oh oh oh, after, after we leave the club, club
You know it's rubba dub dub, in my hot tub)
Pass the Henny and XO
I'll say the word and we go
I want the 'dro and it's homegrown
(So now, after we leave the club
You know it's rubba dub dub, in my hot tub)

[La the Darkman]
Young Miss, I wanna know what you're thinkin'
Your fantasies, and what you're drinkin'
After all that, are we gon' be freakin'?
That determines if we gon' be speakin'
Keep it on the low, know you like creepin'
Know you wanna take me straight to the deacon
Get ya mind right, first spend the weekend
Bubble bath, while I rub on that ass
Henny in mine, Chardoner in ya glass
Tellin' me "No, don't slow it down, do it fast
Keep on goin' daddy, I'm 'bout to splash"
Runnin' up in ya hard as a car crash
Makin' it last, I'm a 4.0 when it come to the flow
I'm a plumber, lay that pipe good, you know?
Let's leave this joint, roll up a joint
And I could show you how to ride like Cedar Point

[Chorus x0.5]

[Willie the Kid]
You're now rockin' with the truest
Tell ya girlfriend you 'bout to leave, ma let's do this
Gimme the word, you could slide with ya man
And walk to my car with ya shoes in ya hand
My hand on ya waist, cellphone to my ear
You know Willie fly every day of the year
And yeah, that's me, black Jag on dubs
Shoot to the crib, pop bub in the tub
A good back rub, conversate, this and that
Now lay on this pillow, lemme hit it from the back
And we could run it back 'til the Sun come up
Wake up and run it back 'til the Sun go down
Pancakes and hash browns, ya whip game all that
Holla at ya boy, my dick game is all that
Seen me in the club, weed smoke, little Cognac
Gotta a phone number, little mama? Lemme borrow that
Cuz after the club...

[Chorus x0.5]</pre>
