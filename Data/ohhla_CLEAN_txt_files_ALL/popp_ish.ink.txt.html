Song:   Poppin' Shit
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Urgh I pop shit believe that believe that, everywhere I be
you can see that, drinks by the liter, you can see that everywhere I be at

I poppin shit bottles too she pop it for a g
That's what you gotta do, That's what you gotta do
We poppin shit [x3]

[Los]
Couple new Roley's with a couple frozen bands
My nigga squeeze arm's like a couple holding hands
Nigga vroom tryna flip that Maserati over
Smelling like Izzy Miyaki and my fly Versarce loafers
Drop them hunndits, Pop that perfect
Jum in the drop murk it while bumping the locks
Nigga shades Versace probably cost a thousand
Fly to death, private jets flying across an island
I just got me a spade I was just in Spain
Nigga I'm a get this change, Poppy told me slow down
I said woah now that's a no now, Nigga it's about to go down
I'm a turn bad like mowtown, What the fuck they think?
We don't smoke it, it don't stink
This how fly niggas lean, Love my Versace that's a fly nigga thing
I was born a broke nigga I'm a die like a king, Bad Boy

Urgh I pop shit believe that believe that, everywhere I be
you can see that, drinks by the liter, you can see that everywhere I be at

I poppin shit bottles too she pop it for a g
That's what you gotta do, That's what you gotta do
We poppin shit [x3]

[Kid Ink]
Pock' full of hund's in the Levis
Wait got yo' hunny out the beehive
OG got me high than a tree house
2 fingers up like a eat out... wait
Talk for a ride get the seat out
We be in this bitch going crazy... senile
Back then niggas ain't believe what they see now
Grip in my hand ball hard off the rebound
Boom, Shocka, Locka
Picture rollin, loud like a opera
Pull up in that big boy truck it's Satnica
Ready for the show, baby you gonna want an encore
Tell em we ain't on now bullshit
No AC just cool kids
With a bad bitch on full shift, I'm gone off the full hit
I don't think they ready bout to make em forfeit
We've been going hammer time right about the toolkit Alumni!

Urgh I pop shit believe that believe that, everywhere I be
you can see that, drinks by the liter, you can see that everywhere I be at

I poppin shit bottles too she pop it for a g
That's what you gotta do, That's what you gotta do
We poppin shit [x3]

Wait I tell her bring her friend cus we multiplying the ash
I let Ink divide her legs and we never provide a fraction
Two young fly niggas on a private jet
Running out of Ink tryna write me a check
Don't start no shit won't be no shit!
I said fuck the world but we don't care
We do molly to the models
Suicides on that Rarri'
Like soy-e sauce on the body
Then body shift to a hotty

Urgh I pop shit believe that believe that, everywhere I be
you can see that, drinks by the liter, you can see that everywhere I be at

I poppin shit bottles too she pop it for a g
That's what you gotta do, That's what you gotta do
We poppin shit [x3]</pre>
