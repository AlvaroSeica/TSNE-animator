[Verse 1]
If it wasn't for Kool Herc, hip hop wouldn't be created
That's bullshit, I would of created it tens years later
Niggas acting up till the guns is heard
I don't hear you poppin shit now, mums the word
And all you rapping niggas, what, that's all you got
Think you a thug now you doing songs with Pac
Gotta bullet in my stomach doctors scared to remove it
And 25 stitches above my dick to prove it
But I can't die, so I don't wear no vest
I'm like super nigga, gotta SF on my chest
Nigga I'll take a automatic and play Russian roulet
Just to collect, life is short expect my death
Told you once, told you twice
This is the last time you can boooooooop give me a flat line
Even if I bleed to death I can't die
Not even if I fell from ten stories high
Yo, I'ma rule the underground or get shot trying
No matter how many times I get hit with the hot iron

[Chorus]
I'm not die'n
What bring it I'm not die'n
I'm not die'n
What bring it I'm not die'n
I'm not die'n
What bring it I'm not die'n
I'm not die'n
What bring it I'm not die'n
I'm not die'n
What bring it I'm not die'n
I'm not die'n
What bring it I'm not die'n
I'm not die'n
What bring it I'm not die'n
I'm not die'n
What bring it I'm not die'n

[Verse 2]
I tried everything swallowed pills slit my wrist
Made my own brother shoot me, X-1 fuckin missed
Tried to paint the walls with my brain but the gun jammed
At my first shoot out, I stayed everyone ran
I want it rawwwwww, and more than ten different women
Locked myself in the garage with the Benz runnin'
As a kid, they had to watch me carefully
Tried to put the blow dryer in the bath with me
Everywhere I go, I hear voices, who calling me
Doc said my brain damaged but I don't see nothing wrong with me
Maybe that's why half the industry won't do a song with me
I walked amongst the dead
Talked to punks with lead
An eye for an eye
We can all go blind
All you niggas talking about you ain't scared to die
I feel nigga, cause I ain't scared to kill you nigga WHAT
I'ma rule the underground or get shot trying
No matter how many times I get hit with the hot iron

[Chorus]

You can't kill me {8X}</pre>
