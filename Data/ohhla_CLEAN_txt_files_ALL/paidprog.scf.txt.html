[unknown televangelist]
What do you mean we're not to judge?
You know, I can't stand some of these churches today
and all of these rock bands
Even Al Sharpton, the great black leader said
"We are fed up with all the FILTHINESS of these songs
 and all of the foul language they use"
Someone said, "Do you believe there'll be music in Hell?"
Well if it is it'll be rock'n'roll and rap
And I make no apologies for saying it
We've done away with the great hymns of the faith
"The Old Rugged Cross," "I'd Rather Have Jesus"
Ahh what have I to dread, what have I to fear? NOTHING
I'm leaning on the everlasting arms!
You can't even get a decent message out of most of today's music
And I'm not afraid to say it

[televangelist gets cut off]
Well this completes Channel 3's broadcasting day
Portions of today's broadcasting schedule
have presented complete or in part by mechanical reproduction
Have a good night, and a GOOD morning
