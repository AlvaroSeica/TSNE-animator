[Tyga]
Unreal to a closed eye
Can't feel but you heard that I'm close by
It's more vivid, the image invented in my mind
I look around and really I see a fake smile
No time, when the tickets down
My Rolex style don't mean shit now
It's just another pay cut my mind made up, unnecessary lay-ups
You can still win, ain't gotta a rich a star player
Fuck a hater, still remain a, self-made nigga
Live bigger, credit cards no limits
I dropped twenty on the luggage took 10 minutes
I don't shop online, those are all gimmicks
Only make moves when your heart's in it
B.I.G. said it, so I entertain like Cedric
Standin on the trunk roof top, view the city
Batman, spotlight, gotta say you bitches
The joke's on you Jack; who the fuck you gon' call
when your shit towed, by the repo
Can't tell your girl so she the centerfold
Now you gettin played like Casio's uhhh
Casinos, C-notes and chips like Fritos
Got a free coat in Costa Rico
Most hoes only know two words
Like "gimme those" - still buy 'em though
Currently ballin so I gotta let you know
Flash through the tint roll the window, tilt the brim
What the fuck I did, let me see your registration
I'ma keep it real kid I'm just hatin
Ain't a opportunity I ain't take close
Chase, City, National Bank, evolve into shape
of a dollar then I, duplicate
Motherfucker don't believe let me demonstrate
I dreamed a motherfucker tried to kill me in my sleep
What's the point of steak, when niggaz want beef?
Diss me cause they hungry
Made a meal that you couldn't eat
You fuckin snakes in the rat race, two-faced bitches
That's why I don't fuck with none of y'all niggaz
Cause sooner y'all fell and you fell with 'em
It's like puttin '87 in a Bentley; nigga don't tempt me

[Chorus: repeat 2X] {w/ Marsha ad libbing along}
Everything ain't everything; shit ain't always what it seems
I put that on everything, no sleep havin light dreams
What I see is what I can't reach, I put that on everything
Goin crazy, I might be; no sleep havin light dreams
I dream (I dream)

[Outro: Marsha Ambrosius]
