[Fingazz]     "Fi-fi-fi-Fingazz on the track..."

[Rap Verse 1: Big Meech]
Hey
The wait is over, it's summertime, you feel the heat
Throw on your stunna shades and white tee, it's Big Meech
A couple young superstars, me and Keke P.
We gotta move it from the beach, to the street
Ay

Chorus: Keke Palmer
Woke up in the mornin' and I see the sunshine
Only got the summertime on my mind
My girls and I, we kick it all the time
Only got the summertime on my mind (Ay)
We keep it movin' (Way-oh, ayo)
We keep it movin' (Way-oh)
We keep it movin' (Oh, oh, oh)
Oooh-oh
Oooh-oh

[Keke Palmer]
(Verse 1)
Everybody know that
School's out, no doubt
You know this one goes out
To all of my homies
It's what you been waiting for
It's 92 (Outside)
Let's make our move
And get into a little somethin'
Radio's blastin'
Let's make this happen
Homies and shorties, stand up (Stand up, stand up)
Let's get this party on
Let's do this now
Be young and proud
Show 'em how we hold it down
Get it, get it

Pre-Chorus: Keke Palmer
312, yeah
They know how to jerk it
212 and 310 about to twerk it
Get it, get it, get it
Come on now, it's goin' down (Come on, let's get it)
Everybody feelin' just fine, it's summertime

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 2)
And 106 &amp; Park
Gon' come on
And my favorite joint's on
It's a block party
So don't be afraid to lose control
It's all about you
Do what it do
Can't nobody tell us nothin'
Well, I love hip hop music
Let's go ahead and do this
Homies and shorties, stand up (Stand up, stand up)
Let's get this party on
We doin' it now
Be young and proud
Let's go and show them how
Get it, get it

Repeat Pre-Chorus

Repeat Chorus

[Rap Verse 2: Big Meech]
Okay
It's summertime, 'bout to Party Like A Rock Star
A couple months, beating pie like a hot car
Cause time flies when you havin' fun
So hit the floor and try to find yourself a summer love
With me
I keep it movin' all seven days of the week
I'm like Miami cause the boy always bring the heat
I got them Big Thangs Poppin' like my name was T.I.P.
Doin' tricks in the whip with Keke P., the million dollar kid

Repeat Chorus</pre>
