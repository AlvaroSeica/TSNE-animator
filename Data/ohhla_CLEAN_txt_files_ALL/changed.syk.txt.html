[Verse 1: 2Pac]
By age sixteen I sold to dope fiends
Not yet a drug dealer, but I watched them closely
Until they noticed me
I got the feds wondering who broke the law
Far too inhibited for gun smoke, I broke his jaw
Words harder than a fucking diamond
Mobile phone call to Simon, niggas tripping homey, when we riding?
Fuck them slowly like Jodeci
And stick a needle in my eye if I don't live and die for M.O.B.
And fuck your homeboys nigga we can drop the guns
I'll hit your block and we can box for fun
Nigga one on one, last to fall is a balling cat
It's Death Row, why the fuck you think we call it that?
So if you knew me in my past life
Don't act like we homeboys, ain't no love in the fast life
I switch gears on them jealous bitches, who do you fear?
The game plan of a changed man, so what I'm saying is

[Chorus: Nate Dogg](x2)(2Pac)
Now you can ride with me, live and die with me (fuckin wit Changed Man)
Changed Man
But no one understands, the ways of a changed man (nigga you fuckin Changed Man)
Changed Man

[Verse 2: Big Syke]
Million dollar plots
Birds and flocks is how I wanna live
It's hard to change after living so negative
What I give back is Mac's and packs and facts
And ever lasting game watch your back and stacks
Young macks stay the loc'est and keep the focus
Don't get ground to bow down nigga soak this, game
From a criminal element stay wide open
Bud smoking nigga trip, get to gat smoking
But keep hoping and praying, laying the foundation
Watch thieves, fake G's and perpetration
Imitation is lethal, stay true to the one's you love
Put slug's in these wanna be thugs
In these drugs, bud and alcohol
You make emergency call, to a down fall
After all they got Pen's for us, and our future kids
All the things I did, where's my cig's?

[Chorus: Nate Dogg](x2)(2Pac)
Now you can ride with me, live and die with me (fuckin wit Changed Man)
Changed Man
But no one understands, the ways of a changed man (nigga you fuckin Changed
Man)
Changed Man

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
A nigga so cold when I flow, bow down to Death Row
Three wheel motion, coming through coasting
Who's that nigga in the G-ride
Screaming out M.O.B, nigga we ride
I hit the charts like a stick-up kid
Number one in the nation
I fucked the world
The Judge gave me probation
Faced with incarceration
Move tapes like it's big weight, slanging to the whole nation
Gimmie mine, or I'm blasting on every song
Murder my enemies, I'm mashing until I'm gone
One love to my thug niggas
And fuck a bitch, cause a true sister love niggas
Throw yo' hands in the air, close your eyes and hope
Never come against the mass of smoke, on Death Row
My adversaries bleed
But fuck 'em all 'til the talk cease, fucking with a changed man

[Chorus: Nate Dogg](x5)(2Pac)
Now you can ride with me, live and die with me (fuckin wit Changed Man)
Changed Man
But no one understands, the ways of a changed man (nigga you fuckin Changed Man)
Changed Man

[Outro: 2Pac]
Everybody think they understand me
Shit, you niggaz don't know me
Y'all know that nigga on the rap song
Y'all know that nigga in the movies
You don't know this nigga in 3-D
Real live right up against you in front of yo' face
Shit, nigga you fuckin with a changed man
This fuckin shit on deathrow
Westside, Outlaw Immortalz, hehehe
Nigga you fuckin with a changed man
Hahaha..Nate Dogg up in this biatch you know that nigga aint no muthafuckin
joke
You know what time it is
Hahaha.. I ain't the same, you fuckin with a changed man
We ain't the same, you fuckin with a changed man
Kurupt in this biatch
Bad azz and Snoop dog
