[Bronze Nazareth]
I know I said I'd love you but damn I'm just a man
Or never was a man, enough to hold your little hand
Or walk with your mother, she labels me gutter
Cuz I came from it
can't relapse, shutter cuz the pain runneth
You wanted water from a rock
Blood from a turnip
And now you turn up, bleeding from the forcep
While at my door slept opportunity
too unsoothing to fool with me
now you look and drool at me
like I'm wearing Satan's horns and jewelry
what happened to that smile, 32 teeth
calcium, iron pills cuz you don't eat
don't grow, so we don't sleep
unless we sleep together, meet the weather
stormy forever, pleasure brings much pain
I know you hate me from pits of your brain
but numb it stays like novacaine
cause you never came, into the iron hills of pain
yo you can loathe me, God'll put it in frame

[Bronze Nazareth]
In lifes blurry scenes,
the sound of the city became my only screams
night child, cement blocks were my smile
looking up at the bottom like this shits hell
when it hits well, bricks sale
I'll take two vials, see if it sits well
poison in hand, this is a man's limit
sat at the corner of nowhere, my heart wasn't in it
that's why the beat stopped
I'm like,  please God help me, cause I'm losin it
Forgot to pray last night, but its not doing shit
I'll probably learn secret books from now
How my many questions he gave a look somehow
Cause as I sat thru the inferno of abortion
Family calamity, his triple beams and gram tossin
I sat alone, brick walls the kids home
Her belly's smaller, but my sins well has much grown
Just like her pelvis bones, I loved somebody who aint love me back too
Nigga it wasn't just you!!!!
And when I wandered life looking for your home
that one set of footprints, I proabably did walk alone</pre>
