[Intro: Cee-Lo Green]
Do whatever you like; do whatever you like (shh) {*4X*}

[Cee-Lo Green]
If the bubbles feel good
Hop on in and let me take you away
(I can only soak a minute - I can't stay longer than that)
Well this is your life
Stick a finger in my jet, it's not gay
Upstairs is Francine
Downstairs is shouting
(These bubbles go straight up my...)
Do whatever you like; do whatever you like (shh) {*4X*}

{What time is it? Damn}
{Why is it so hot in here? Uhhh}
{I must be dreamin', this room seems to be steamin'}
{Wait wait, hold up - hold up!}
{Is that a bubbly sound I'm hurrin'?}
{There's water everywhurr-an'}
{I'm freakin', straight tweakin'}
{Where is my man, he best not be creepin'}

[Interlude]
Do whatever you like; do whatever you like (shh) {*4X*}

[Cee-Lo Green]
Don't listen to her, listen to me
You gotta do the tub if you wanna be free
{I'm your wife, listen what I say}
{Out of the tub or no boo-tay}
(What should I do? I don't know)
(I can't get out cause it's too cold)
It's frustration
versus, relaxation - uhh-huhhhh
(I feel so conflicted, but this is up to me)
(On one hand there's the hot tub - the other's family)
{So what's it gonna beeeeee?!}
{Choose Stan!}</pre>
