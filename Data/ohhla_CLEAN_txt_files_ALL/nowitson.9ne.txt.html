Wicked wicked
Now it's on (echos)

[Short Nitty]
I murder your whole city
Nigga like Frank Nitty's hideous as idiots
Niggas betta get respect when I flex 
Comin tech flows like amphibians
From here to the Carribeans
Unexplored territories like Venus
Niggas never seen the teen the teams keenest
Bury ya mind like Zimas
Infared beamers keep ya posse on my penis

[Tech N9ne]
Now it's on
Wickeds in this da link a mid to west flex
Did a piss
To this bitch who dis this cl-ick
Bliss is hangin that bitch by the clitoris
You get spit on
Shit on
Hit on
Get on the dick of this
Sl-ick niggaRA
But you can always call the Nina
A killer in America
Amerikilla

[Short Nitty]
I got skills to kill
Like overdosin pills
Blood spills for million dollar bills
You can't try to peel this
Or feel the illness
Of a nigga that's comin out real (real)
I don't know why
Nigga you livin a lie
A plus I despise those who try
A nigga like I this high and fly and sly
Mid west side so you just might die

[Tech N9ne]
Check it out
I murder these hoes, Hercules flows
My shit carries on like hepatitis
So don't bites me
An enemy 
Gimme no fuckery foul like (what)
Now I gotta cock it to re-write it
I might just
Make a nigga bite dust
When I bust plus
Can maybe feels great
Can it be ill? yes
Sanity kills a real nigga but still 
I wreckin like I'm a Deville
The best, the NINE!, correct, BURN!
Now it's your turn
You must LEARN!
Misery niggas the craze like 24 gang niggas on SHERM!
When it's on I be heated like a hot comb
Tell these punk muthafuckas to leave me alone
When I'm in the zone you get blown away
Get the clothes away
Mitch Bade niggas cause it's on today

[chorus]18x
Now it's on

[Lejo]
Now let me smoke and choke
Let these niggas know that Lejo ain't brought no jokes
Nigga betta learn the ropes
We like costra nostra 
And'll fuck around and cut yo' throat
Decapitation facin devastation nations when they ragin can't stop this
Nigga you can catch a fist 
And you can rest in piss
But the diss and you thought I missed
I'm indestructable and untouchable
Ain't givin a fuck about what you know
I don't love no hoe, I don't mug no mo
But I'm still collectin my other dough
Now peep the rawness my rhymes is flawless
Fools get tossed for tryin to floss like bosses
People can call this the clique wit no losses
Cause a nigga can flow from September to August
Deeper than seven seas, colder than no degrees
Niggas is easy to get down on ya knees
When you fuckin wit rhymes like these
I always find that he's bitin my shit it's me he's tryin to be
No more chances understand this
I'm the man wit the plan I stand from Kansas
And this weed enhances scandalous dances
What is in my hands will take yo last glances
Fuckin wit a technicality, that's what it gotta be
Nigga sittin on the side of me
My mentality makes fatality reality
Split yo anatomy, assault and battery
Niggas pray to God we stop, we won't though
Askin who's on the top, they don't know
But don't no muthafucka in the muthafuckin western muthafuckin hemisphere really want Joe
Associated with a deadly force we got codes
Deeper than morse 
Sounds like (noise)
And needle points bullet shoot through a horse
So of course 
I'm leavin niggas dead like a corpse

(Gun shot then a pause...)

[Tech N9ne]
Don't test me
Biatchres
Another collorialism I came up wit the bitch deep this twist
Betta hurry pick a position I do for when you niggas submited to Amerikilla did it and then I 
I quit it I flip in a minute I'ma get them rellish lips
You can't sell us dip
We gettin high off K bombay (bombay)
Packin hella heat like Pompay (Pompay)
Itch-made abay igga-may anyway 
I get ill when I feel like, gettin biz
You know what that is?
I know what that is
When I be rippin eveybody know what that is
Rewind, SLEMET, NIET, HAA, HEEEH!!
If anybody wanna catch this
I just said fuck demons and I got pit backwards
And that's bomb futuristic attack shit
Match this
Takes hella practice
To rips scripts nigga gotta be thug
I gotta make this shit make sense so I can say "made it ma"
Top of the world
Gimme life or give me death
Death becomes evil like asmodious I gotta a melodious flow
It becomes podious changeable
Untameable angel 
Angelic
Bustin like a Magnum, Tom Selleck
Advisary terror 
Sick of loosin money in Harris
Mac assasin like Anotonio Banderas
How many niggas you know I bust style
So ambidextrous and I mean I'm buck wild
When it's on
I be heated like a hot comb
Like I said in the first, zone
Accident prone 
But these niggas don't wanna flex wit Tech when the heat is on
Nigga
Now it's on
