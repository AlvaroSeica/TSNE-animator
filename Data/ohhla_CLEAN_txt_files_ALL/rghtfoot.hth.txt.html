[Verse 1: Suffa]
When I lay down to sleep I turn to a deep thinker
Don't wanna be a whinge like a lonely binge drinker
It's just that, well they dont call me Suffa for nothing
I'm a depressed, harrowing, repressed suffering 
maniac, screaming at anybody, anyplace
Man I love people I just hate the human race
And I hate all my friends cos all my friends are takin drugs
They think it's spiritual like a hippy making love
But the powders power only lasts for an hour
So they take a powder shower til' they burn down like Nickey Louders(?)
Sour times come quicker with a drum inside a thinker
With a drum before that, with a drum for ???
Everyday for her's the saaame
Leg up, chin up
Left foot, right foot
Lay down - shut up
And relations get fucked just like everyone else
Man damn, screw all your problems, I'ma focus on myself and

[Chorus] {x4}
Left foot, right foot
"Keep it moving"

[Verse 2: Pressure]
I spent the last twenty two years of my life earning my way
around the world, this space around me, watching night turn to day
I earnt to pay in certain ways but it wasn't that they told me
Greys between black and white and opposites attract
Possibly that the world of one man is filled by another
Yo suffa we breathe the breath of others, your sancturies my cover
This feeling in my upper is possibly life
That matches negative thought so I move positive mics
Probability stikes, random targets live in famine
And the heart is too much for one man to stand regardless
The powder and pills ain't no way to heal my friend
Lean on one shoulder, the other rises like my skills ascend
See life has many ups, many downs and many miles
Many broken promises, hollow words and empty smiles
Consequently many dies when they break from the hit and hate
Drowning in this everyday give or take

[Chorus] {x8}</pre>
