Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1: King Chip]
I'm just what you made God
Not many I trust
Ima go my own way, God
Take my faith to wherever you want
I'm out here, on my son
Won't stop 'til I get me some
Club hoppin' tryin' to get me some
Bad bitches wanna get me sprung
Early in the morning, I'm wakin' bakin'
Drankin', contemplatin', ain't no such thing as Satan
Evil is what you make it
Thank the Lord for that burning bush
That big body benz I was born to push
On my way I'm burning kush
Nigga don't be worryin' 'bout us
Neighbors knockin' on the door, asking can we turn it down
I say, "Ain't no music on" she said, "Naw, that weed is loud"
Nigga, we ballin', straight swaggin'
Lost heart, but I'm maintainin'
I've been told that I'm amazing
Make sure keep that fire blazin', we livin'

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
I need smoke
I need to smoke
Who gon' hold me down now?
I want to get high y'all
I want to get high y'all
Need it to get by, y'all
Can you get me high y'all?
I want to get high y'all
I want to get high y'all
Need it to get by, y'all
Can you get me high y'all?

I'm just what you made god,
Just what you made
I'm just what you made god,
Just what you made
Just what you made god

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
Let me tell you bout my month y'all
Endless shopping I had a ball,
I had to ball for therapy, my shrink don't think that helps at all, whatever
This man ain't wearing these leather pants
I diagnose my damn self, these damn pills ain't working fam'
In my spare time, punching walls fucking up my hand
I know this shit sound super cray, but if you had my life you'd understand
But, I can't fold, some poor soul got it way worse
We're all troubled, in a world of trouble
It's scary to have a kid walk this Earth
I'm what you made God
Fuck yes I'm so odd
Thinking 'bout all my old friends
Who weren't my friends all along
Hm, when it rains it pours
Whiskey bottles of the six and fours
Everyday the first things a chore
Amidst a dream with no exit doors

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
I need smoke
I need to smoke
Who gon' hold me down now?
I want to get high y'all
I want to get high y'all
Need it to get by, y'all
Can you get me high y'all?
I want to get high y'all
I want to get high y'all
Need it to get by, y'all
Can you get me high y'all?</pre>
