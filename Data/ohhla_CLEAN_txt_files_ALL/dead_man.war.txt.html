[Intro: Warcloud]
Holocaust was hit by a meteorite
He is now to be addressed as Warcloud

[Chorus 1: Warcloud]
"Eighty shots to the mouth and the brain, shouting my name" -&gt; Warcloud
Warcloud
"Eighty shots to the mouth and the brain, shouting my name" -&gt; Warcloud
Warcloud
"Eighty shots to the mouth and the brain, shouting my name" -&gt; Warcloud
"Eighty shots to the mouth and the brain, shouting my name" -&gt; Warcloud

[Warcloud]
The Red Sox traded Babe Ruth to the Yankees
An ant swimming in orange juice, I'm loose
Diabolical, the skeleton makes green
Bio-freak out of cell eighteen escape clean
An old jagged fence where you hang your clothes to dry
Shake the apple tree where the burial grounds fly
Never un-clever, smoke goes up the chimney
Keep a clenched fist for funny niggas that envy
Flick my cigarette in the dirt after I curse
Stagger through the street's the worse from the hearse
Three revolvers, a strike down at the steel mill
Soon comes today spread out because I will kill
Paint the cover red, my thoughts from above the sky
Follow the shadow of a butterfly while others die
Grandfather song skipped to my loo
The all station man, sick like the flu
Guns are his favourite, meet Skeleton Lowe
Wind in the trees, MC's corrode
The diabolical Warcloud strikes again
Once known as Holocaust who slaughtered men

[Chorus 2: Warcloud]
"Chump-chump-ass niggas eyeing me temp me
I'll break it down simply I'm horrifyingly empty" -&gt; Warcloud
Warcloud
"Chump-chump-ass niggas eyeing me temp me
I'll break it down simply I'm horrifyingly empty" -&gt; Warcloud
Warcloud
"Chump-chump-ass niggas eyeing me temp me
I'll break it down simply I'm horrifyingly empty" -&gt; Warcloud

[Warcloud]
There's Dead Man's lab out on the breeze
Cat at the window, swarm of Killa Beez
Wait 'til the daylight, man dressed in brown
Killed every MC who spoke in town
Tall people, short people, thin people, fat
Danced with the monster wearing a hat
Straight people, crooked people all fall down
I stepped over them and littered the ground
Old Warcloud, heavenly diabolical
Catch me if you can facing a verbal obstacle
Court is adjourned, shake hands with Mr. Thorn
Murdered for the Lindbergh baby was born
Chaos in the ballroom, sprinkling apple seeds
The hanged man's rope twirls in the night
When you standing by lightning run in, go and get your tight friend
Your rhymes like the constitution, written in water
Warcloud slaughtered, save the sons and daughters
Break off your arm and stir my rap stew
The ghost drums bang inside the haunted village
You stuck like an Arctic bird in oil spillage
A shoe in the rain, for veins I got change
Strike so quickly that your brain has no time to register pain

[Chorus 2]

[Warcloud]
Maniacal intentions, strike a lonely match
Your rhyme's like chicken scratch, the plot hatch
Silence in the gardens, silence on the hill
Shadows creep across land in blood spill
Skill from the darkest regions of the earth
And I hold that saying best
The world is full of drowsy things and Dead Men playing chess
Up goes my umbrella then I leap
Warcloud smokes his pipe, sips his tea
Alcatraz grimy storybook, my lingo
Beat you like Ringo in a tree of jingle
Rain just hasn't been seen, flowers thirst
MC's heads all burst, a rugged church
Just down a lake, pictures in the windows
Pistol, pistol, pistol in the dirt
Money truck in the river, the Pisces
Slashing like Nikes, sipping Korean icies
Phantom in the typewriter, sack of wooden nickels
Guns drawn on the culprit Pickles
Colonel in the high tower shaving with a clever
Dynamite sticks, a glitch in your receiver
Moth in the closet, stand in the clearing field
Leave MCs slumped, biting into the steering wheel

[Chorus 2]
