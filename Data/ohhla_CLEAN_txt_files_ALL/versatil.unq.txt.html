Song:   Versatility
Typed by: jostmatt at bluewin dot ch

Changin suddenly, style is different
I'm takin a pause, so stop riffin
Great Unique is in effect, cold comin straight out the stash
MC's'll get smoked just like a cigarette till they're nothin but ash
I'm takin over the rap industry with speed and agility
What'd be a better title for this jam - than Versatility

I'm the imperial grand exaulted chief boot knocker
I'm even known as a fly party rocker
But I'm a wizard with these words that I weave
It makes me an opponent that can never be deceived
I been rappin for 10 years, there's nothin I don't understand
If you don't believe me, ask Buggs and Dashan
I'm usin words and make 'em fit into the craziest rhyme
Either way it's always on time and you are all on mine
I come from Brooklyn, so there is nothin you can tell me
I'm the teacher, so how could you fail me?
I'm standin on top of the list, don't try to dis
You'll miss, so kiss the thundering fist, yo bust this
I size you up by the width and then I measure the length
I have you shakin if you're fakin, word is bond on the strength
I'm unbeatable, undefeatable, uncheatable
So don't look for a pound, I'm not greetin you
I start war, now spell that backwards
( ? ) somebody livin inside a shack would
Try to be down walkin around like a clown
And you would never make a sound if you was in my town
You get your feelings hurt so bad you walk away with such humility
It's just a section of the Great with versatility

Your reaction has a fraction of relaxin and maxin
So much action, no distraction, you scream like I was Michael Jackson
I'm a girlie go-getter, you see there's no one better
Take off your sweater when we cruise inside my Jetta
Hm, have you ever heard a rhyme that fresh?
You have now, comin from Unique in the flesh
I need a break ( *scratch noises* )
Cut it up Dashan, cut it up ( ? )

I'm an expert in vernacular, a poet with vocabulary
The way I flush MC's is unsanitary
I eat them up and let them out just like manure
Digest them, then infest them, leave them smellin like a sewer
I'm from Medina and I don't take shorts
MC's are drunken vampires guzzlin rhymes by the quarts
I'm energetic, scientific and my beats are narcotic
Pure dope but they're sweet like a fruit that's exotic
I hate MC's with a passion
That's why I'm smashin, trashin, faces I'm bashin
In, you can't win, it's a sin if you try
It's obnoxiously blasphemy, so stop askin me
Why, cause I did it and I'll do it again
As I begin you be my enemy, in the end you're my friend
Cause I'm the highest paid vocal, my points are always focal
My name is Unique and I'm an express but you're a local
I shoot to kill, ( ? ) like Benny Hill
And on the wheels of steel Dashan is gettin ill
It's time to start buggin
I carry a 2x4 like Jim Duggan
My style is changin up while I'm rearrangin up
Methods of music, some choose it then exchange up
Thoughts if you think you can match such ability
This combination of words is versatility

Huh, you thought I was finished but it's not over yet
You're soaken wet, drippin with sweat
We can do this like Brutus cause my girl is the cutest
I pursue this cause you blew this and there is nothin to this
But here's a clue to this, MC's are new to this
They ( ? ) while the Great one stays true to this
I'm puttin heads to bed without dinner
Hittin like Tyson and I'm always the winner
Breakin bones when the combo connects
Cashin fat-ass checks, wringin rappers by their necks
Did you think I would forget about my beatbox skills?
Cause when I b-b-b-bump I will send chills
Up your spine, blow your mind and I be sproutin with fertility
Now that you know ( ? ) versatility
