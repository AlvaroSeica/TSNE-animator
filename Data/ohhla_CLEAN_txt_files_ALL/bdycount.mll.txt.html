Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Rick Ross]
Make sure you know what you're dealing with now

What's your body count nigga
I'm double digits
What you talkin bout nigga
It's time to get it
Bad bitches in the house
They all exquisite
Couple million in the couch
Right here where I'm sittin

What's your body count nigga
I'm double digits
What you talkin bout nigga
It's time to get it
Bad bitches in the house
They all exquisite
Couple million in the couch
Right here where I'm sittin

[Meek Mill]
I got some bad hos in my crib
Coup' stones in my couch
Scarface in this bitch
It's like a gun store in my house
Hobart on my desk
Bag it up by ounce
The feds watchin this bitch
Oh lord it's three strikes and I'm out
I'm gone

What's your body count nigga?
I'm double digits
Thirty birds I'm thinkin we gon need another kitchen
I used to pack my little work out my mother dishes
Now I'm the one to get the work to get a couple pigeons

Then we cook em up
And let em dry
We break it down
And let em fly
Send em to the hood
And tell em bye
All my niggas liftin weight but we don't exercise
Ha

[Rick Ross]
What's your body count nigga
I'm double digits
What you talkin bout nigga
It's time to get it
Bad bitches in the house
They all exquisite
Couple million in the couch
Right here where I'm sittin

What's your body count nigga
I'm double digits
What you talkin bout nigga
It's time to get it
Bad bitches in the house
They all exquisite
Couple million in the couch
Right here where I'm sittin

[Meek Mill]
Murder after murder
Nigga you ain't heard
Cause when it come to beef I'm puttin bread all on my burger
Man them shooters be so hungry
Bodies on they burner
I could send em to your crib
Spot you ain't come for em
They gon tear you out the frame
Fuckin rip your picture
Send a message to your homie just to make him get the picture
And if they tellin on me
I could make em hit the witness
They been off em like a summons
Dawg don't make me give em business

Talkin all that killa shit now what's your body count
The shotty bounce and make your motherfuckin body bounce
We on the graveyard shift where all the bodies found
... on twenty-threes
Them make the ride it bounce
Ah

[Rick Ross]
What's your body count nigga
I'm double digits
What you talkin bout nigga
It's time to get it
Bad bitches in the house
They all exquisite
Couple million in the couch
Right here where I'm sittin

What's your body count nigga
I'm double digits
What you talkin bout nigga
It's time to get it
Bad bitches in the house
They all exquisite
Couple million in the couch
Right here where I'm sittin</pre>
