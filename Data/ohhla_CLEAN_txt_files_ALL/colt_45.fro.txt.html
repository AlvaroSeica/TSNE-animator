[Intro]
Wait a minute man
Hey check this out man tell it
There was this blind man right
It was this blind man right
He was feelin' his way down the street with this stick right
Hey he walked past this fish market
He stoped he took a deep breath, he said [Snifff]
Woo, good morning ladies! hahahaha
You like that shit man? hey man I got a gang of that shit man!
Hey, I tell you what...We'll all have a good time
We'll pull on the drug
And hey, hey if everybody try on the mike
I tell you all these mother fucking jokes I got cuz..
But first I'ma start off like this, hey help me sing it homeboy

[CHORUS 1]
Said colt 45 and 2 zigzagz baby thats all we need
We can can go to the park after dark
Smoke that tumbleweed
As the marijuana burn we can take our turn
Singing them dirty rap songs
Stop and hit the bong like cheech and chong
And sell tapes from here to hong kong
So roll roll roll my joint
Pick out the seeds and stems
Feeling high as hell as hell flyin' thorough palmdale
Skatin on Dayton rims
So roll roll roll the '83 cadilaac coupe deville
If my tapes and my cds just don't sell, I bet my caddy will

[AFROMAN]
Well it was just sundown in a small white town
They call it east side palmdale
when the afroman walked through the white land
houses when up for sale
Well I was standing on the corner selling rap cd's
When I meet a little girl named Jan
I let her ride in my caddy cause I didnt know her daddy
Was the leader of the ku klux klan

We fucked on the bed
Fucked on the floor
Fucked so long I grew a fuckin' afro
Then I fucked to the left
Fucked to the right
She sucked my dick 'til the shit turned white
Thought to myself sheeba sheeba
Got my ass lookin like a zebra
I put on my clothes and I was on my way
Until her daddy pulled up in a chevrolet
And so I ran I jumped out the back window
But her daddy he was waitin' with a two-by-four

He beat me to the left
He beat me to the right
The mother fucker beat my ass all night
But I ain't mad at her prejudice dad
Thats the best damn pussy I eva had
Got a bag of weed and a bottle of wine
Im'a fuck that bitch just one more time

[CHORUS 1]

[AFROMAN]
I met this lady in hollywood
She had green hair but damn she looked good
I took her to my house because she was fine
But she whipped out a dick that was bigger than mine

I met this lady from Japan
Never made love with an african
I fucked her once, fucked her twice
I ate that pussy like shrimp-fried rice

Don't be amazed at the stories I tell ya (tell ya)
I met a woman in the heart of Australia
Had a big butt and big titties too
So I hopped in her ass like Kangaroo

See I met this woman from Hawaii
Stuck it in her ass and she said "aiee"
Lips was breakfast, pussy was lunch
Then her titties busted open with hawaiian punch

I met colonel sanders wife in the state of kentucky
Said I'll fry some chicken if you'd just fuck me
I came in her mouth, it was a crisis
I gave her my secert blend of herbs and spices

[CHORUS 2]
Said colt 45 and two zigzags baby thats all we need
We can go to the park, after dark
Smoke that tumbleweed
As the marijuana burn we can take our turn
Singin' them dirty rap songs
Stop and hit the bong like cheech and chong (hey wait a minute)
And sell tapes from here to hong kong

[AFROMAN]
I met dolly parton in Tennessee
Her titties were filled with hennesee
That country music really drove me crazy
But I rode that ass and said yes miss daisy
Met this lady in oklahoma
Put that pussy in a coma
Met this lady in michigan
I can't wait 'til I fuck that bitch again

Met a real black girl down in south carolina
Fucked her until she turned into a white albina
Fucked this hooker in Iowa
I fucked her on credit, so I owe her
Fucked this girl down in Georgia
Came in her mouth, man I thought I told ya

Met this beautiful sexy hoe
She just ran across the border of mexico
Fine young thing said her names maria
I wrapped her up just like a hot tortilla
I wanna get married but I can't afford it
I know I'm gonna cry when she get deported

[CHORUS 3]
Colt 45 and two zigzags baby thats all we need
We can go to the park, after dark
Smoke that tumbleweed
And as the marijuana burn we can take our turn
Singin' them dirty rap songs
Stop and hit the bong like cheech and chong
(hey wait a minute man, hey fuck that shit)
And sell tapes from here to hong kong

[AFROMAN]
Have you ever went over a girls house to fuck
But the pussy just ain't no good(say what)
I mean you gettin' upset because you can't get her wet
Plus you in the wrong neighborhood
So you try to play it off and eat the pussy
But it take her so long to come

Then a dude walk in thats her big boyfriend
And he asks you where you from
So you wipe your mouth and you try to explain
You start talkin' real fast
But he already mad cause you fuckin' his wife
So he start beatin' on you ass

Now your clothes all muddy
Your nose all bloody
Your dick was hard but now its soft(what)
You thought you had a girl to rock your world
Now you still gotta go jack off(heeehaaaa)

[CHORUS 1]
