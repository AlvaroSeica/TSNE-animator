[L.E.O.]
I'm back like anarchy, top off in a heartbeat
These niggas can't off me, smart me, sharp as shark teeth
If I don't see how God see, hard me
Stand tall like the walls be, flow like the North Sea
Saucy off L.I., smell I, like that Paulie
Red eye off them pure leafs, of course we, swell pies
Tell lies, tell guys, yeah, you good here
Get 'em in the hood here, and leave a nigga booked here
Pitcher like Randy Johnson, I don't mean baseball
Few Rockaway stars, under them radars
Them bases is loaded, under them state laws
But they on they way home, cuz I'm batting like A-Rod
Run home, I hunt domes, clapping that A-R
Ay ya'll, the boss smell like backwoods of haze jars
I make my brain fog, cloud like rainstorm
But I still see shit clear like a sunny ass day
Dog, money and that yae raw, yae is pure
I'm looking at ya'll plate, ya'll still shaving off eightballs
Guess that's the reason, I'm the nigga they hate on
Still wit pass, or moving fast in them racecars
Make them say God, he just shitting that face ya'll
But tell 'em that, I'm the wrong one to try to take on
When them trays on, they gone like the night when it break dawn
Stay strong, but a leg on, and hang on

[Interlude: L.E.O.]
Yeah, these niggas better stop coming up with excuses
And come up with the solution, you dig?

[L.E.O.]
Murder capital, have the murderers after you
Early morning, tear up your corner, burn up the avenue
Then it's, back to the honeycomb, money long
Just be alarmed, we arming the Vietnam, when the money gone
Then it's, back and forth with henchmen
We clap women and children and that's some real shit
The cost of war with interest, equal doors off the henges
Kill my brother and it's only business, nigga
Simple addition, never personal
Get murdered out and you ain't even worth that trial
Bitch nigga, pull ya skirt down, half of a chick, nigga
Half of a chip off a chip, you missed, you don't exist, nigga
You admit that description don't fit you, nigga
Pescriptions won't fix you, nigga, when them pistols get you niggas
It's all about that grip and the trappy, I'm from the M-M-Murder
C-C-Capital, and nigga we m-m-murder happy</pre>
