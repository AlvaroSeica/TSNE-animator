[Intro - 2x]
We on the grind, working hard
We-we on the grind, working hard
We-we on the grind, working hard
We-we-we on the grind, working hard to get it

[Lil' Keke]
All this dranking and banking, got me continuously thinking
About my giants and my grands, and my Benjamin Franklin's
We on the griiiind, stacking G after G
Got my faculty in back of me, these niggaz plotting on jacking me
No limitations or imitation, Commission's for sho'
Better check the game when I wreck the game, walk straight through the do'
Now it's mo' money mo', gotta get rich 'fore I go
I stay creased up and piece'd up, from head to toe
Not a fro but a bald fade, in Texas that's playa made
You niggaz think we country, but we getting paid
Cause we real with it trill with it, and still with it
Got skills to make a mill with it, so deal with it
You feel it, get up and get it these niggaz want my head
On top of that, I'm being chased by the fed
Infrared I'm leaving em dead, it's either them or me
My J-O-B, is verbally assaulting the industry
Can you see what I see, or you blind
This motherfucker mine, went from crime to rhyme
At the drop of a dime, better blaze your heat
Cause Commission rich niggaz, taking over the streets
Staying sweets for weeks, that's the way that it goes
Twenty thousand at my shows, I'm getting gold on these hoes
Cause I fill the front rows, for a large amount
Nation wide and independent, making both sides count

[Chorus]
We on the grind, working hard to get it
Commission rich niggaz, stacking chips you feel it
We on the grind, working hard to get it
We click with it thick with it, don't forget it
We on the grind, working hard to get it
Seven digits we split it, we the shit admit it
We on the grind, working hard to get it
Now shake it baby shake it baby, let me hit it

[Archie Lee]
Catch me a million dollars later, getting paid like P
You see I grind for mine, putting it down like a G
The Hitman, I make you change your game plan
Come short on my money, you soaking wet in a van
From Tennessee to Texas, known for squashing plexes
Can't stop this grind, cause yo we young and we wreckless
Getting paid is a must, if it's a hit I'ma bust
I'm too cold to hold, I'm too hot to touch
I'm hard headed embedded, super unleaded don't forget it
When I bust on tracks, niggaz respect it
Commission rich man, from H-Town to Japan
Blind you from the ice, in my gold wristband
Ain't nothing changed, but a nigga got mo' change
And some of y'all niggaz capping, with no change
I run with Luciano, Nitty and we run the city
So niggaz come and get me, what

[Chorus]

[Lil' C]
We on the grind we gon' shine, so sit back and recline
Smoking weed of all kind, money falling in line
Women blowing my mind, out on the coast of Rican line
Everything is fine, sipping wine from '79
Cause we did it and done it, the whole time we was blunted
We on the grind on the shine, doing shows in the summit
We worldwide, anytime you need us we ride
And collide, and make the whole world scream Southside
Frank Nitty the Commission, we platinum and gold
Matter fact go pick us up, at your nearby sto'
And play it in your radio, cause you can feel us for years
We on the grind all the time, bigger and better ideas

[Chorus]

[Outro]
We on the grind, working hard
We-we on the grind, working hard
We-we on the grind, working hard
We-we-we on the grind</pre>
