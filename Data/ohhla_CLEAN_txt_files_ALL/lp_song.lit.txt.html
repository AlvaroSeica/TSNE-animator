Song:   The Little Prince Song
Typed by: LittlePrince1981@aol.com

Rising from the Dirty South
excited that the world has now invited this disciple
to recite the lyrics burning clouds of flames
circling round the innocent for perching 'round
these insignificantly insufficient representers of a chain; better yet an area
generations I will change with every second I'm inhaling
every breath of rhyme exhaling is so soundly unaccounted
for surrounding all the sound I bellow out
within the bowels of my mouth I hold responsible
although
I guess I'll take the blame as I know somewhat
well the rate my mouth exerts its hidden statements
in the way that I will here decinigrate
till every village in the Milky Way knows I'm nothing to play with
for the gift which I was given
has enabled me to slip a glitch within the system
causing terror and confusion barely to amuse
the simple peasants who refuse to listen carefully to music
so inevitably
I use this method of projecting written letters with a message
to the depths of misconception while the planet realizes
until the Earth is swallowed in dirt
I vow to leave it as the greatest ever walking its surface
I am...

Little Prince (and I'm only) Little Prince (and the only)
Little Prince (that can go for) Little Prince while
behind the image I create and all dimensions
I will make from certain melodies
I'm chosen to forever be; Little Prince (and the only)
Little Prince (that is known as) Little Prince
(because there's only) Little Prince
now; before I forget though I shouldn't have to say I'm...

Here to terrorize anybody who decided they would dedicate
their lives with their body and their soul elevated on the line
wishing for it you can stop though
Jesus sent me here to treat your dreaming like a cockroach
seeing how I steam as if I'm bleeding kerosene and drink my tea with gasoline
you would think I'm bringing heat but people
if I'm equal to a hydrogen bomb
why would I keep a lighter peacefully inside of my palm
to pump fear inside the heart of every modern-day imposter
shoving garbage into ears portraying heroes they were taught of
and to haunt them till the mention of my name troubles
and corrupts them where they're mentally encaged
but mentally insane is what they suffer from
and I ain't even touching them but pain seems to bother them so
straight into another one
it's evident I'm better than the rest of these lames and so
believe I'm gon' be king until the take us away
my name is...

Little Prince (and I know that)
Little Prince (is the only) Little Prince
(nowyou know that) Little Prince is the hidden treasure w
hich you never knew existed
yes
I'm really here
it wouldn't help if you resisted; Little Prince (cause you know that)
Little Prince (is the only) Little Prince (while I'm only)
Little Prince I would never change even with the chance to change it...

Plainly
cause I know that God is planning something great for me
awaiting me is power to influence what to make of the blessings
he reserved me and definitely served me the lessons I neglected
with the parents who insured me that anything I need or desired
to have was always in my reach along the means of finding a path
I'm always found to let them down but I won't illustrate
I swear my wordy threats are not in vein
because I swore to make them proud
so I'ma carry every sound my voice emits until the power
is felt deep in the clouds but watch me levitate
around a flock of imitators proudly while the presence of a prophet
melts deep in the crown; I won't emulate an ounce of what these people are making now
I've conquered evil and made it out beyond deceit and pray that now
ain't nobody badder than me
like I'm the crunkest person since the days of Adam and Eve
but this is the beginning
Little Prince...

Little Prince (and I know that) Little Prince (is the only)
Little Prince (nowyou know that)
Little Prince is the hidden treasure which you never knew existed
yes
I'm really here
it wouldn't help if you resisted; Little Prince (cause you know that)
Little Prince (is the only) Little Prince (while I'm only)
Little Prince I would never change even with the chance to change it...</pre>
