[M1]
Yo, down south, niggaz know about crackas and black people
When I came up north, I started hangin' with Latinos
The Borikens and Tainos and even the Arawaks
It's the language that be dividin' the Spanish from blacks
My name is eme (M) de la gente, comprende, intiende
You feel me, Veicus to the Bronx, Habana to South Philly
We the same people, started way before Puerto Rico
Our history is more than just packages of penico
From Columbia, El Choko - they black too
Zapatistas in Mexico, we fightin' for you
Sandinistas in Nicaragua keepin' it true
Like the Tupac Amaru down in Peru
My name is eme (M) - uno, revolutionary
You can still catch a punio, my style straight susio
Police straight puto, we keepin' it caliente
DPZ, Tone Touch, we buildin' this movimiente
And the only way we winnin' this black and brown power
No backin' down, now it's the time to get ours
If you touch one, you touch all, it's more than a rhyme
We in this together son, your beef is mine

[Chorus]
My people, my people, we struggle, we struggle together
I'm with you, I'm with you my nigga, whatever, whatever
My people, my people, we struggle, we struggle together
I'm with you, I'm with you my nigga, whatever, whatever

[Stic.man]
Mami, don't be twistin' up ya nose, I'm your forgotten brotha
Spanish rose ain't got no love for a brotha?
We the same folk, same boat, same heritage
The slave ships with the P.R. just like America
Now just because you light, don't be thinkin' that you white
Puerto Ricans and blacks, we still fightin' for our rights
See, we're from the same root love, we on the same team
I'll put my cornbread and greens with your rice and beans
For every Black Panther party there's a Young Lord
We oppressed by the same system, so it's one cause
Latin Kings know about that gold and black on one flag
All my Spanish-speaking comrades hold ya rag
We want squad, libertad, from Cuba to Angola
Chase spirits still in the youth, they can't hold us
The hot whether to conquer, the Capoeira
The Spanish moms and black pops that got together
A struggle in the ghetto, is a struggle in the barrio
DPZ, Tony Touch, all up in ya audio
You touch one, yo, you touch all
And if you with U.S.A. then mothafuck y'all

[Chorus]
My people, my people, we struggle, we struggle together
I'm with you, I'm with you my nigga, whatever, whatever
My people, my people, we struggle, we struggle together
I'm with you, I'm with you my nigga, whatever, whatever

[Tony Touch]
Yo, yo, yo, yo, united we stand, that's why I invited my man
M1, big Stic, it's all apart of the plan
I'ma smash this shit, like as hard as I can
Blast right quick to as far as Japan
I come through with my fam, cause we bringin' the rawk'
Leavin' you stuck, really we ain't givin' a fluck
We touch one, we touch all, we about to get hectic
If my crew don't get in, then the Touch make a exit
To the rear, I'm outta here, don't front on my brothas
I takes care of them, before I takes care of others
Barkin' on these crooked cops and undercovers
Put em on the spot and rock em with the butters
It's just a preview, enemy I see you
You tryin' to creep through, but we gon' defeat you
Sooner or later, I'ma let go the lethal
And rep for my people like Pedro Albizu

[Chorus]
My people, my people, we struggle, we struggle together
I'm with you, I'm with you my nigga, whatever, whatever
My people, my people, we struggle, we struggle together
I'm with you, I'm with you my nigga, whatever, whatever
