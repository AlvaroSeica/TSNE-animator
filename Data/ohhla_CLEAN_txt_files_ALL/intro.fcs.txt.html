[20 seconds of wind blowing then heartbeats are heard]

[Focus...]
It's now or never..
Like Em said, "You only get one shot"
Got everything to gain, and a lot to lose..
Listen.. [*thunder cracks*]

I lost a lot in my life - moms, my pops, Biggie
J Dilla, the World Trade, and New York City
I lost religion but STILL hopin that God's with me
Prayin that the haters never up and come get me
I keep my sons with me, hopin they never hear .350 [*gunshot*]
7 Mag, give 'em what I never had quickly
I lost a lot of fake friends cause I'm mad busy
I TRY to bring 'em with me, but niggaz is mad iffy
I let a lotta hoes trick me
Now I'm so picky, ain't no woman wanna roll with me
Give me pussy cause these bitches think I know 50
and Eminem, and then they wonder why I act shitty
Yeah I know Dre, but what's that got to do with me?
The industry is really actin like they through with me
They say I'm hot, but won't have nothin else to do with me
Screws with me, then the motherfuckin truth hit me
Stay dedicated to ya sons and to ya fam
They the ONLY ones that love me and really know who I am
I'm Focus... second, but first I'm a fuckin man
Dedicated before, but now I finally understand
I'm dedicated...[*echoes*]
