"Let's begin with a drum set"

[Intro]
Yeah yeah, well alright now
Check it out, it goes, well it goes, well it goes

{*drums stop*}
"One, two, three, four"

[Verse 1]
It goes fuck what you heard what you thought what you said
Forget everything you know what you were told or read
'Bout to tell it like it is, if it's over your head
You better pick it up and learn it, code is closer to red
You've mostly been fed, one side you're mostly misled
They want you tunin out shit well listen closely instead
Fact is, if you don't then you only gon' get
'Bout half of what you should know but don't know yet

[Verse 2]
Yo don't let yourself be tamed by the TV
Radio's got the same ten songs on repeat
The papers claim to be the vein of the free thinkin man
But man, y'all need to stop sleepin
And if I can find the rhyme to save them
Make them wake the fuck up and shake the dust off
I'd stop and say it for God's sake
I'd take a boombox and play it and make you not complacent

[Verse 3]
You own 'Pac and hate it, we won't stop 'til we top the playlist
Your whole block and nation indoctrinated (Sweatshop)
We save the way you thought
But never put into words to rock the crowd and start the mayhem
Drop the 808 and take away the things you're taught
Sing along if you can sing or not
Everybody two-step, let your fingers pop
All the girls make noise when we hittin the spot
