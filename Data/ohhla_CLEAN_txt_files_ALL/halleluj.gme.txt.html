[Intro: Game]
R.I.P. to my nigga George Jefferson
Niggaz is movin on up
And I know Weezy personally (Chuck, what up!)

[Chorus: Game] + (Jamie Foxx)
Halle-muh'fuckin-lujah
All my real niggaz I salute ya
All the bad bitches I'ma run through ya
Hop in my holy Ghost, hallelujah
(Damn, damn, damn, damn)
Hop in my holy Ghost, hallelujah
(Damn, damn, damn, damn)

[Jamie Foxx]
Heaven prays, all I'm tryna do
Praise Him (praise Him) praise Him
Heaven prays, all I wanna do is praise Him
My Lord

[Game]
Nigga I ain't pastor Mason yo
Nigga Pat and Ron, peach CÃ®roc, Ace and y'all
And since I got good taste and all
This for all the bad bitches couldn't wait to get they braces off
I know we in church, and the way that I'm thinkin wrong
But inside the Bible is the perfect way to sneak my phone
But I don't wanna do that, I came to take the service in
and stare at all the women who brought they Louis purses in
Bad bitches in here, forgive me for my sins
I ain't mean to walk inside the church cursin again
I wanna live righteous and you know I love Jesus
But you can't catch the holy Ghost in the Prius

[Chorus]

[Jamie Foxx]
Heaven prays, my Lord

[Game]
Lookin 'round the church like "What that nigga doin here?"
He probably told on somebody, 'posed to be doin years
... But who am I to judge a nigga?
A.R. don't wanna go to church, I can't budge the nigga
But I love the nigga, so I'ma go for both us
And put these G Star slacks with these Louie LOAFERS
He rather sit outside and listen to Hova
But the service jumpin, the pastor servin mimosas
And all this ass in here, how do I focus?
Collection plate bulgin, damn pastor you the coldest
... My envelope stay swollen
So I'ma count my blessings now, somebody hold this

[Chorus]

[Jamie Foxx]
Heaven prays, all I'm tryna do praise Him

[Game]
Starin in the row behind me, man these fat hoes is too cheap
Ain't payin they tithes, takin up two seats
And look at God's house, packed full of sinners
With the sunrise service, now they back for the dinners
Yeah I know the chicken good, but your soul ain't
And your outfit clean, but your nose ain't
And I suppose ain't nobody a liar in here
If that was true the whole church would be on fire in here
I'm sho' glad we got a choir in here
to wake me up, every time I get tired in here
And one thing's for sure, gotta praise the Lord
Cause when I went to Undefeated, they still had my Fours
Fell to the floor like

[Chorus]

[Outro: Jamie Foxx]
Heaven prays, all I'm tryna do praise Him
(All I'm tryna do is) praise Him (praise Him)
Heaven prays, all I wanna do is praise Him
(All I wanna do is) My Lord (ohhhhhh yeah)
My Lord (ohhhhhhh praise Him, all I wanna do is)
All I wanna do, thank your lovin
It's alright, it's alright
It's alright this evening, I said it's alright this evening
Sometimes we have to go through things, to understand what love is all about
Hallelujah</pre>
