Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Dude you're pretty swoll have you been working out?
Uh yeah, why are you looking?
Oh no, not like that man, I mean, no homo
Ohhh no homo. Cool
When you want to compliment a friend (no homo)
But you don't want that friendship to end (no homo)
So tell a dude just how you feel (no homo)
Say 'no homo' so he knows the deal (no homo)
Hey yo man you got a fresh style (no homo)
And you know you got the best smile (no homo)
Your girlfriend is a lucky lady (no homo)
But your looks would make a handsome baby (no homo)
I like the way your shoulders fill out that shirt (no homo)
It's hard to pull off but you make it work (no homo)
Hey yo I kinda like your natural scent (no homo)
Hey yo I kinda like the musical Rent (no homo)
Man I cant decide who wore it best (no homo)
But I'm feeling Diane Keaton's vest (no homo)
I admit it I'm a fashionista (no homo)
and I know every line of Mystic Pizza (no homo)
and yo damn this rose is something special (no homo)
damn we should goof around and wrestle (no homo)
lets hit the hot tub and take a dump (no homo)
we're all friends ain't no room for trunks (no homo)
Yeah man I'm really feeling buzzed right now (no homo)
Are you really feeling buzzed right now? (no homo)
Yo we should watch this gay porno tape (no homo)
but as a joke because we're all straight (no homo)
man you could wash laundry on those abs (no homo)
Yo I think girls look good in drag (no homo)
Hey yo I've been thinking about posing nude (no homo)
Hey yo I've been thinking about fuckin a dude (no homo)
Or we could 3-way 69 (no homo)
Or human centipede in a line (no homo)
Or some docking could be hella fun (no homo)
Or yeah man I could do this one (no homo)
Hey yo no homo but I wanna dress up like Dorothy
and butt fuck a dude while he 69s Morrissey
Yeah no homo but I wish I lived in Ancient Greece
to gave young socrates the illful release
Hey no homo but today I'm coming out the closet
and I scream it from the mountains like a gay prophet
those two words have set me free (no homo)
damn it feels good to be (no homo)</pre>
