[Ceschi - with a faux British accent]
Francisco False, they all hate you, the way you stop to comb your hair
Out to the left, because you claim that it's what God does
And everybody stares and giggles, when they see you dancing by
Laughing at jokes, that you have killed with, in your own head
Don't fool yourself Francis
They won't come back again
And you're not all alone at all like you predicted listen
You might as well just go to sleep
Might as well... go to sleep...</pre>
