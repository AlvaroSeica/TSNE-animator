[Ese Rich Roc]
(Verse 1)
Don't let no one get you down
That's the message I'm sayin' it
From the heart
It's time for the stereotypes to start
Ending
Cause it's been going on too long
No one is live, but I see
No one tries to prove 'em
Wrong
So it goes on with no say, in it
I think it's time to deal with it
Just because I grew up in the barrio
Did that give you the right, to put me down, well, I don't know
They must have separate rights
For a Mexicano
Must have drew up new laws for us to follow
Cause it seems we're not treated the same
I ain't following no laws for some people who can't
Pronounce my name right
We gotta fight
For equality
We gotta bring it brown pride like it oughta be
Don't let 'em change our culture
Don't let 'em run our future
Some people let it, and it happens if you
Could let it get to you, well, I never sweat 
Cause I'm
Down to brown, and a change, they'll never get it
Why?
It's simple
Cause we were hittin'
For it in from the beginning, except
No one's admittin' nothing
Some things always stay that way
But whatever they say or do, don't let 'em change
You stay proud
And never ever let 'em get you
Down about our race

Hook: Ese Rich Roc
"Don't let no one
No one
Get you down" --&gt; War

(Verse 2)
You see, the green, white, red is the color of my, heart
And it'll take a lot more abuse for me to start
Sellin' out
Cause I am who I am
A foolish youngster, a Mexican, that can
Make a change, it's kind of strange, but it's, fun
They used to say it couldn't be done
Without a gun
In my hand
And now, they can't stand me
Cause they done think I could do it the same
How could it be?
A Mexican, I can read on their face
They think low of us, a stereotype
Our race
They say we're lazy and can never make a difference
But I didn't let it get me down
See, with this song
S. F.L.Y. is doin' the part to start
Showin'
That we can go in
The other direction
The Latin connection, it's dope and
Down to be brown
That's why they're hopin' we would
Fail
Cause that's what they expect
All except respect, well, we don't get none if you check
Ever since they took our land from us, but remember that
This is the beginnin' of us, takin' it back
It might take some time, it might seem like forever
Though keep one thing in mind and always remember
To stay proud
And never ever let 'em get you
Down about our race

Repeat Hook

[Ese Rich Roc {*slowed down*}]
"(???) put me
Down, in the ground
Hear what I say
I'm not black
I'm not white
I'm in the middle
I'm just right" --&gt; War

(Verse 3)
City to city, it's all the same
But why does every city seem like it has a Spanish name
They call us a minority
But in my area
We're a majority
And they still ain't do nothin' for me
We had to make it to the top ourselves
With no
Help, from anyone else, now I'm gettin' wealthy
See
They're gettin' mad
Cause I'm Mexican
Didn't think I do it, when I saw the face
That's when I
Knew that it would take
Time for them to notice us
Since I'm makin' money, bet you didn't even know
This was a cholo
And now I guess you do
Better watch your back cause we're catchin' up to you
We're flying high, and sooner or later
If we all work together, we can make
A better or greater life
For the Latino culture
Guess I thought wrong
When I thought you would
Help Latins out
But it hasn't never lasted
Never gave me nothin' cause I had a Spanish accent
But that ain't get me down
You see I'm still the same
Low down, down to be brown
And I'll never change
They'll never change us, we'll always be around
Puro brown side of town
Where we're always
Proud
And never ever let 'em get us
Down about our race
