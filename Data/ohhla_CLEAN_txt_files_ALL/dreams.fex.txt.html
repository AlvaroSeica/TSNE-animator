[Phonte]
What am I waiting for? So many places I could see
But who wants to do it alone? So alone, 'lone, yeah

[Chorus: Carlitta Durand]
I don't wanna ask for too much
All I know is dreams are made for two, babe
Dreams are made for two, babe
Without your smile and your touch, what's it mean?
Cause dreams are made for two, babe
Dreams are made for you, baby

[Phonte]
I'm laying on the shore, it's so amazing by the sea
But who wants to view it alone? Be alone, no (Ooh-whee)
And if you've come this far, then it might as well be
Be with someone you love, ooh-ooooh

[Bridge: Phonte]
And when the lights go down I pray we never change (uh, hey)
Cause girl I adore it (I do, yeah I do, yeah I do)
Lay with me and everyday I'll do the same
I hope that we endure it (yeah I do, yeah I do)
Let's get it

[Chorus]

[Rap Verse: Phonte]
Yo.. somebody ring the alarm
Gots to face it, I've embraced it
Life's the +Bracelet+, baby you're the +Charm+
Something more than lookin good on my arm
Don't need a costume, girl I got you 
That's the gospel, turn to the book of Psalms
Buy a beach or buy a farm
It ain't a dream if my dream can't come along, listen..

[Bridge: Phonte]
And when the lights go down I pray we never change
Cause girl I do adore it, ohh
Lay with me and everyday I'll do the same
I hope that you enjoy it (Hah~! Cause I do, cause I do)

[Chorus]</pre>
