[Dirt Gritie]   
It's been a long time since I spoke with you pops 
When you on the road get on the phone cause you still in my heart 
I feel as though we growing a part       
I see you every night though in my dreams its dark
Daddy don't you go that route 
See I'm too young to be the man of the house 
 
[Muta Mouraine]
Besides mommy needs a man to chase her round in the house 
To pinch her back side and help her out 
And I can get you higher than those drugs ever can 
Do you know what it's like to raise a strong young man? 
And as I grow I take my life in my hands 
I run with gun clappers that'll clap you man 
Learned that from 50 he a rapper dad 
Brought up in front the TV so my eyes are bad 
And mommy she can't feed me do you think that sad 
Huh, well that's your bad 
We live on welfare and family allowance 
Juggling the bills is a stressful balance 
But somehow, I know we'll manage
Keep our faith in the lord and we'll meet the challenge 
But me I keep my faith in the gun 
 
[Dirt Gritie]
And I don't want to see you around me or my mom
You stole my youth, I'm no longer your son
Sincerely yours to you, no one
 
[Chorus 2X - Dirt Gritie, Muta Mouraine &amp; Sierra Jamerson]  
In this world that is cold I keep to myself 
And try to find a balance between mental and health
But if I, but if I fall will you be there to help 
When I reach for your hand will you hold it out? 
 
[Bridge 1X - Dirt Gritie]     
If I could write a letter to my peers I'd tell them no more tears
When the tide takes you under cause the bank is near 
Keep your head above water and your conscience clear 
Or find yourself lost in a sea of despair  
 
[Ms. Trish]    
If I screamed a little louder would you hear me Ma?
I know you down, pops dead and gone
But this man that you with he be doing me harm
Caught him in the laundry room smelling my thong 
 
[Sierra Jamerson]                 
And ever since that day shit's been on 
He put his hand on my thigh I try to tell him he wrong 
That's why I cry to myself alone 
And you always out away from home 
Away from reminders a family that's behind us 
The way we ate together when pops was beside us
At times I feel as if I don't exist 
And wonder if I kill myself would I be missed 
Janey had a gun should I get a clip
Next time he push up on me shoot off his dick 
Yeah he got money but who gives a shit 
Are you blinded to see what he do to your kid 
The bruises, I feel like I'm losing it 
I try and tell you but you say that its jealousness
 
[Ms. Trish]    
What the hell is this, why he deserve your trust 
How'd he come before me, when'd he get between us
 
[Chorus 2X - Dirt Gritie, Muta Mouraine &amp; Sierra Jamerson]  
In this world that is cold I keep to myself 
And try to find a balance between mental and health
But if I, but if I fall will you be there to help 
When I reach for your hand will you hold it out? 
 
[Bridge 1X - Dirt Gritie]     
If I could write a letter to my peers I'd tell them no more tears
When the tide takes you under cause the bank is near 
Keep your head above water and your conscience clear 
Or find yourself lost in a sea of despair</pre>
