[Frank Ocean]
Get on my bike, and I'ma fly through time
Until I'm with you - I promise

I'm scared; I guess I shouldn't be
But I'm a boy, in this adult body
I know I said, that we would grow old together
But I haven't - and that's cost you years

[Chorus]
This has been the one of my fears
That has only ever caused you tears
So time machine, take me ahead 'til I'm with her
Gotta be with her, with her, with her, can't let her live by herself
Oh time machine, maybe, we can take her with us
Long as I'm with her, with her, with her she ain't livin by herself
Lift off and goooo ohhh-whoa-whoahhhh
Ohhh-whoa-whoahhhh {*ad libs*}

[Frank Ocean]
I tried; with all my might I peddled as fast as I could
Until the years just started to flicker past
Our lives, all of this
I saw memories on both sides of the road
I pointed them out as I went along
Right there, we're makin out
Listenin to "Purple Rain" in the basement
And just ahead I can see your heart fallin but I can't save it

[Chorus] - minus last two lines

[Frank Ocean]
I'm on my way there, to that time and space
I wish you could see all that I see now
I'm headed toward you yeah, I'm wishin time could wait
I'm a mile away

[Chorus] - minus first two lines

[Outro]
Lift off and goooo ohhh-whoa-whoahhhh
Ohhh-whoa-whoahhhh {*ad libs*}</pre>
