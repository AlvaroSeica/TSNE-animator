Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Oooh

[Verse 1]
When it comes to love
I know that pain
Comes with the territory
I been here before
Can't take one more
To end like a sad love story
Now that your here I'm hesitating
Just need a little understanding
Baby I don't want to wonder
How you got close to my heart

[Bridge]
Say you'll never leave me lonely
Say that I'm your one and only
Tell me baby if I let you hold me
That I'll be safe in your arms

[Chorus]
So baby be gentle
Hold on, don't let go
If we fall apart you'll break my fragile heart.
Promise you'll always be here to handle it with care.
And love me from the start
(don't break) my fragile heart
(don't break) my fragile heart
(don't break) my fragile heart
(don't break) my fragile heart
(don't break) my heart

[Verse 2]
It seems that we
Were meant to be
In love this way forever
Give me what I need
Now baby I see
That you are a treasure
Gotta know your dedicated
To see it through you gotta be patient
Baby I'm so glad I waited for you to come along

[Bridge]
Say you'll never leave me lonely
Say that I'm your one and only
Tell me baby if I let you hold me
That I'll be safe in your arms

[Chorus]
So baby be gentle
Hold on, don't let go
If we fall apart you'll break my fragile heart.
Promise you'll always be here to handle it with care.
And love me from the start
(don't break) my fragile heart
(don't break) my fragile heart
(don't break) my fragile heart
(don't break) my fragile heart
(don't break) my heart

[Verse 3]
After all is said and done
After all the rain is gone
It feels so good to know
Your the sun to help me grow
After all the stars have fallen
You'll be there to hear my calling

[Chorus]
So baby be gentle
Hold on, don't let go
If we fall apart you'll break my fragile heart.
Promise you'll always be here to handle it with care.
And love me from the start
(don't break) my fragile heart
(don't break) my fragile heart
(don't break) my fragile heart
(don't break) my fragile heart
(don't break) my heart
(don't break) my fragile heart
(don't break) my fragile heart
(don't break) my fragile heart
(don't break) my fragile heart
(don't break) my heart</pre>
