	Strange!!
	("And I like it...")

[Myntric]
Think quick as I split
a-toms and bust critical mass through some plastic
Get hot like saliva but spit like boric acid
Ditty done run get amped off the wonderman surprise
Mercury rise, I rock off my greedy little eyes
Sun, moon, pronouncing the energy is solar
With tongue numba one I have fun, rockin fuller
Let me wash the aloe vera from my strands just stop blocking
The scientific method of the locking, check it
as I, shoot the ray beam from the moon
Then rebound off the lunar, get amped off the beats
and mic get tuned, check the rhythm
into another dimension for direction
Arrange when I dissect, rearrange when I'm dissecting
the flavor, how many does it take to get to the core
Of a Boo-gie-mon-ster, when he rip it or he's raw
So, whatcha got, jigga nigga Jugganaut
I'm strange when I rhyme

[Vex]
Well I'm beyond critical mass, feel the lyrical blast
Vex the vortex, man of the past
Livin in the present, and walkin in the future
H2O's, the flow as I dilute ya
Twenty-one years now I stand as a man
Drinking from the ocean crushing mountains in my hand
The natural one, eighty-four seasons I have come
Wisdom goes to those that see the sun
God, iniquity's thicker
Any black man who draws the blood of another he's a quitter
Avoid, so go and get a stricken babysitter
A million dreadlocks throws devil in the picture
purgatory, just to seckle all that petty talkin deranged
Boogiemonsters come in strange

	Strange!
	("And I like it...")
	Ha-haha, these kids are nice
*repeat 5X, 4X - line three*

[Yodared]
Mondo McCann, microphone man
Yodaredsee Milo, dig when his mind expand
Vex to the rhyme is never social man
Myntric funk tanker slang a banger fifty grand
With the Riders of the Storm can yes we can can
Pack a black attack to evacuate the land
*together* The empire's falling check the New World Order
           for the slaughter, run for shelter, underwater
           See seventy percent of the world's underwater
           Seventy percent of your body's underwater
           Seventy percent of what we live is out of range
           We rearrange disorder, but niggaz say we strange...

[Mondo]
A million and one things in our vocabulary are considered strange
Some are legendary, some deranged
But we be not the suck shits cause we explore untouched
Consider hip-hop a big virgin and we -- AHH
Remember your first days of course the sex it felt strange
You blindly explored each other's emotional plane, but hey
The Boogiemonsters consist of four
Experimentin from now til forever and we score
with the Jugganauts the giants, all the way to humans
Forever buildin hip-hop and if not nigga we're fumin cause we're

	Strange!
	("And I like it...")
	Ha-haha, these kids are nice
