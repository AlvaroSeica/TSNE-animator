[D-Sisive]
The schematic chart implied in disassembly of secrets
Coils of whispered desire
The tablets lying crossed at the points of predatory abandonment
and tied to a consciousness rising with collective volume
There was a metallic conduit
A perogee around a glint of the night's earliest dreams
Their origins, a conjuration streaming out of scum rock theories
and then, a slip of magic
The agent of a sudden pact.. {*echoes*}</pre>
