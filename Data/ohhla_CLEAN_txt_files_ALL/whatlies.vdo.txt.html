Song:   What Lies Beneath
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Vado]
I call from the ghetto
(The ghetto)
I know that
(I know that)
Have no education
(Education)
But that's ok
(That's ok)
I know the streets
And I'm making all the right connections
Aha
Aha
With you on my side
There's no way I could get knocked
I go right to the top

[Vado]
I kept crawling to reach
Made a sale
Then I played the corner store
Gave the owner a piece
My eyes low like I'm going to sleep
Plays an L Slow songs and church bells
When I know you deceased
Can't tell who be holding the key
You just plain to check planes
Compressed cane
Dull on the streets
(That's my slang)
Took em O.T.
Small town in a complex
Dope was a ten
So now we ain't making no bomb threats
(Yes)
About to blow block know
They tryin' to get on next
Need a flow and a strong muscle
Like when your arms stretch
Black tuxedo for convicts
(Convincts)
Hot bottles but still thug egos for narcissists

[Chorus]
Streets of hack
Fiends of smack
Let the connect messages incoming back
On the road to success to your train off track
Niggers talking they talk
Till the fans, all clap
Streets or pack
Fiends or flack
Let the connect messages incoming back
On the road to success to your train off track
Niggers talking they talk
Till the fans, all clap

[Vado]
Ah
Black rose and my lapelle
Like call is there from a black rose and these gazzelles
Paid it for with the stacks fold when I could sell
My bitch and chick played the right role for that Chanel
Tell your jaw
Take my time to crack a ton of votes
(Aha)
Discussed it been it with gangsters down I don't wanna talk
(Warrap!)
He fell back off of his feet
'Cause he ain't want no war
Tried to put the money no suits on be coming sure
(Ha)
Watch the game and see there's no wins
Old teams dangling army coats on the cold ends
You wreaking like straight hair
No spins, no grinds
I'm coming home but they ain't going in

[Chorus]
Streets of hack
Fiends of smack
Let the connect messages incoming back
On the road to success to your train off track
Niggers talking they talk
Till the fans, all clap
Streets or pack
Fiends or flack
Let the connect messages income back
On the road to success to your train off track
Niggers talking they talk
Till the fans, all clap

[Vado]
Ah
Son it's a shame
Gun it for fame
And J playing 2k hunting the game
Only cash be 2k hunted the cane
So M.K. work changed but the number's the same
(Feel me)
I'm coming with things make sure that the cash's right
Don't ask twice if you ain't got it you black slice
I'm that nice, too dark without a flashlight
Snatch mice kidnap booze pull like a bagpipe
Great goose is simple
See me flex so I gotta cool while they envy
Coke stretching I always knew what is in me
Cold swaping in case you moving to get me
(Vado)

[Chorus]
Streets of hack
Fiends of smack
Let the connect message incoming back
On the road to success to your train off track
Niggers talking they talk
Till the fans, all clap
Streets or pack
Fiends or flack
Let the connect messages income back
On the road to success to your train off track
Niggers talking they talk
Till the fans, all clap</pre>
