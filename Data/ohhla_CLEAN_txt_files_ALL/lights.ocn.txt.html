[Frank Ocean]
Here goes...
Donald Trump said buy an apartment wit her (uh)
Buying an apartment wit'cha
Greenspan said the rate was good
My pastor says that your faith is major
Best friend said I ought to wife you today
Like, jumpin over the broom
The white dress and all, yup the rice and all
They said you love that girl, you need that girl
But don't you let her go, not ever, not ever, no
Who goin solo baby? I know, you told 'em baby
Watch you, you tell 'em baby, it's cool, it's cool

[Chorus]
But the lights is gonna be on us
That's the reason why I kept this love in the dark
Cause the lights are gonna be on us
Let 'em know, them lights will never turn off

[Frank Ocean]
But it's cool, cause this love will keep us cool
This love will keep us cool, this love will keep us cool
Your father really likes me, heh, he calls me son
Your brother I think he hates me
But you say that's how you know it's right
Your mother invites me to dinner all of the time
Only thing she's been grillin is me
Keep tellin her I love that girl, I need that girl
I won't let her go, not ever, not ever, no
Who goin solo baby? I know, you told 'em baby
Watch you, you tell 'em baby, it's cool, it's cool

[Chorus]

[Frank Ocean]
It's strobing baby, and they burning baby
But don't worry baby, just stay close to me
They flashing, it's like dynamite
This love will keep us about 55 degrees
Don't mind the lights, no baby
Don't mind the lights
The love gon' keep us cool
The love gon' keep us cool

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

[Outro]
But it's cool, cause this love will keep us cool
This love will keep us cool, this love will keep us cool
It's cool, cause this love will keep us cool
This love will keep us cool, this love will keep us cool</pre>
