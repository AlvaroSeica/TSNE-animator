Boss Hogg Outlawz, All Freestyles 3

Here we go again, spitting them hit flows again
Getting that big do' again, me and my click we sho' to win
We set trends, so when we ride them Davins spin
We having ends, so you see diamonds when we grin

But PJ and Dre Day, we go way back

Plus we all got some'ing in common, we love getting stacks
We love rapping bout gats, love rapping bout crack
Love the fact we the realest niggaz, rapping on tracks
