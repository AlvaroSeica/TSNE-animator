[Intro/Chorus: David Banner]
Everybody in my city pushin keys and that's all these kids see
If that's the only thin they hear then that's
The only thin they'll be, we call it "Swag, swag, swag!"
We call it "Swag, swag, swag!"
The homies is bustin slugs, the women is shakin ass
The white girls call us "nigga" and
We just sit back and laugh and call it "Swag, swag, swag!"
We call it "Swag, swag, swag!"

[Kardinal Offishall]
Banner, let me get them, let me speak up
Let me tell them 'bout swag, let me tell them 'bout fraud
Let me tell them 'bout pride and growin up black in a land so cold
You can freeze your soul if you don't have your wits about you
I will out you, if you talk that swag shit loosely
I been chillin on tour 'round the world
And most of the egos really don't move me
I came from the hood but I came up good, my momma raised me right
I was more into Malcolm than into talcum, different kind of fight
I see niggaz sell out who they really are for fame and money
Denounce a profit just for profit with no interest to stop it
My calculations showin as a people we regressing
Most of the rappers I know are intelligent
But they would never bless you with a lesson
They would rather feed you to bitches, drugs, and guns like fuckin clowns
They ain't concerned with your block cause they in the 'burbs now
What's worse, a white supremacist plottin to kill you with evil
Or black faces on the T.V. poisonin our people
Mentally in the streets, our brains are in a body bag
I hope you vote Obama twice, but some of you won't
Just blame it on your swag, swag, swag

[Chorus]

[David Banner]
Is anybody on the next level with me?
I'm hearin niggaz dissin God, y'all think it's witty
I ain't laughing, we don't play in Mississippi
Even when I was broke, sellin my soul wasn't temptin
Let a white cop shoot a black kid
You'll see a few tweets, that's it
He'll march for a minute, that's it
Get a new outfit and a dance like this
Cook! Swag! Woo! Cook! Swag! Woo!
Black kid dead and ain't nobody mad
They won't speak the truth, these niggaz been scared
Call my flow the puddin, the proof's in there
I say the shit they say I shouldn't, I ain't never cared
I been everywhere, took game, spit it, and left it there
I brought a couple of slugs to yo hood, pray I don't leave 'em there
I hope that you don't give me a reason, double dare
I'm hard to scare, I'm what they +Fear+, +A Black Planet+, starts here
