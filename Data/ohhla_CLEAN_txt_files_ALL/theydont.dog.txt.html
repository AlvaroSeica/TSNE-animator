Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

How is it
that they, don't know
that they don't know?
I mean, shit y'knahmsayin?
Now these motherfuckers got
They're livin off of the fat, y'know
But they don't know that they don't know
that they're not doin what they should be doin
But I do know it~! And, I mean
Had they sat down and just reasoned that out to themselves
They had to know that something, was coming
They had to know that if you strike the king you gotta kill him
Heh heh, and if you don't he's comin after you
They had to know that man...</pre>
