[Intro: Rick Ross]
Uh...uh...
This shit is highly sophisticated
I just make it look easy, nigga
Follow me...

[Rick Ross]
I'm so sophisticated
To get a verse from me, you gotta be initiated
To get a purse from me, she gotta be sophisticated
Purchase a whip from me and never miss a single payment
I'm from the city where the Muslims, even Christians hate it
Even the black folk hate to see another nigga made it
Tell all them pussies to chill, champagne refrigerated!
Just bought a chopper cause the last one, got it confiscated (whoo!)
Countin a hundred mil so many times, I contemplate it
You wanna be the hottest but that shit get complicated
I pull your card, I know you're pussy by your conversation
Show you the safe you'll have to kill me for that combination (WHOO!)
Made another two milli just off the compilation (Uh!)
I just hit a lick, I'm tellin you this shit amazing
Got a white bitch, she fuckin me just like she Jamaican (Laaaawd!)
Sippin purple and that motherfucker concentrated
This for my niggaz in them prisons, overpopulated

[Chorus: Rick Ross]
This the mob, so you gotta get initiated
If you a mark, then you gotta make initial payment
We goin hard, run it back just like it's Walter Payton
The game +Sweet+, gave all my niggaz an occupation (Uh!)
We so sophisticated (Uh!)... Shit so sophisticated (whoo!)
Hundred millionaires, bitch we made it (Uh!)

[Rick Ross]
I'm so sophisticated
Smokin weed, bustin open doll and lick her later
I bust her open then I tell her I'ma lick her later (Ha!)
Pull out the stick and spray that bitch just like it's activator
Time to lay down these niggaz who still be masqueradin
We know you're pussies, so you got my niggaz masturbatin (WHOO!)
Round of applause cause them choppers be so captivatin (WHOO!)
So sophisticated cause them hits be calculated (Ha!)
Put yo' dick in the dirt, now you decapitated (Uh!)
I'm gettin money so you'll never hear me talkin petty
Tatted on my stomach, rich forever, Makaveli (Bayyy-bay~!)
Fifty million, hundred million, it's accumulating
I'm the hottest and these other niggaz coolin, ain't it?
I got a bitch I'm fuckin that you see on BET (Uh!)
My lil' Haiti shooters will have yo' ass on TMZ
Breaking news and we STILL get them for ten a key
And if he fakin, fuck him, tell them niggaz c'est la vie

[Chorus]

[Meek Mill]
Double M-G, when you hear that sound in the back right there?
(Hahaha!) Always got a hundred on, nigga
Yeah, {M-M-Maybach Music}

AH~! Shittin on these haters, ball hard D Waiters
Ever since I got money, e'rybody need favors
That's why I ain't got no homies (nah!), and I ain't got no neighbors (nah!!)
But I be on my grind like, I ain't got no paper
But I'm so rich and I got yo' bitch, all in my whip and she all on my dick
With a hand on my stick, tryna live in my crib cause I handle my shit like a candle got lit
'Cause I burn shit down, yeah I'm in my bag and these niggaz so mad 
it's my turn now, and I get that cash and my bitch so bad 
She so sophisticated, I'm ballin hard, fuckin bitches and ain't got shit for haters
I hang my arm out the window ,now watch me get the paper
My neck so frosty, you fraudin, yo' shit refrigerator, boy you an imitator
You ain't got no Ms' in yo' account (nah!), I never ask my amount
Treat that bad bitch like a bad check cause I cash that and I bounce
I ain't never had shit but I grab shit and I cashed out on that ounce
And I flipped that to a BIRD and bounced back like word, go!

[Chorus]
