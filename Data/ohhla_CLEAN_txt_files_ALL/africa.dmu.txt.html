[LIL' HAWK]
Comin' right back at you nigga, it's the Hawkster
Nigga I ain't from Africa, I'm from Crenshaw Mafia
Gangsta no cut everytime that I'm flowin'
Ain't scared of you niggas
Just to let you know, so
What the fuck do you bustas wanna do?
Flamed up, banged up shit nigga, I thought you knew that I'm a true
Young-ass muthafuckin' Gee
With more bounce to the ounce sending you up with a beat and
I'm not tryin' to get no punk-ass rapper
But when I catch your ass slippin' nigga it's on, on site
Tonight - I'll be
Hangin' on a bucket, pullin' up in a G-Ride
Dump 'em with a Glock on these niggas
Bitches everybody get shot
You should've been a Dogg but too bad that you not plot
Another murder homicide when I ride
I be smokin' niggas up so you know I stay high, it's do or die
With me Y-G Lil' Hawkster
Nigga I ain't from Africa, I'm from Crenshaw Mafia

Mad as fuck, think about the payback... --&gt; Ice Cube

[LIL' HAWK]
West/Side C-M-G-B for life with me
On Crenshaw and Century the Mafia has made history
And even know punk niggas wanna do shit
We always stay down on this muthafuckin' streets, peep
My hood is over populated with G's
And I be hoppin' on planes flyin' way over sea's and
Every place that the young nigga been some
Muthafucka wanna get put on the M and shit
And never even seen where's at
But this nigga still down and pack a muthafuckin' strap or bust a cap
Nigga on the drop of a dime and
We don't give a fuck about no bitch-ass One-Time
It ain't like you got a bulletproof punk
You ain't takin' me to jail
M and the L you gettin' your head blown
Into pieces - just like this
On the 104th street is why the crime rate increased
Can't fuck with Lil' Y-G Hawkster
Nigga I ain't from Africa, I'm from Crenshaw Mafia

Mad as fuck, think about the payback... --&gt; Ice Cube

[LIL' HAWK]
Ain't that about a bitch
They want me to turn in my strap
But a nigga like me on the B is sayin' fuck that
Cause these niggas still want to blast
But when I'll catch their ass slippin' that's the muthafuckin' ass
I be blazin' niggas up just - like the thai hash, so
Don't be gettin' sparked' by this young sharp buddah and
It ain't no muthafucka callin' a cop
You sure stop with my Glock and you dead on the spot
Yellow tape
Red tag placed on your toe, these busta-ass niggas gotta go, gotta go, so
Hit the exit before I get to flex it
You can be black or
You can be a Mexican and
White boys gettin' knocked the fuck out
Tryin' to step to a G, you get socked in your mouth punk
You can't fuck with this young G-B
Kickin' up the most dust on this M-I-C, it's me
Your number one nigga Lil' Hawkster
Nigga I ain't from Africa, I'm from Crenshaw muthafuckin' Mafia

Mad as fuck, think about the payback... --&gt; Ice Cube</pre>
