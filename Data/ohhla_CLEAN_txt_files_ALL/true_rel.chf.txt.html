[Chorus]
Ima true religion fiend, bitch what fuck you mean [2x]

Ima true religion fiend [8x]

[Verse 2]
True religion fiend
Ice up with the team
Light it up and lean
Smoke until I dream
Shit ain't what it seems
You might need some glasses
And my nighas bananas
This shit might get tragic
True religion fiend
300 for pants
You don't have a chance
Bitch I shop in France
Money make her dance
Bet she fuck my mance
Pop her with the baggy
Shit ain't what it seems
Shit ain't what it seems
You might need some glasses
And my niggas bananas
This shit might get tragic
True religion fiend
300 for pants
You don't have a chance
Bitch I shop in France
Money make her dance
Bet she fuck my mance
Pop her with the baggy
Break her with the clan
She be eatin dinnas
We don't need no witness
Move light like fitness
My true section ridiculous
Bitch I got the bag
Bitch I stand true
200 on shoes
Molar niggas rule

[Chorus: (Repeat 2x)]</pre>
