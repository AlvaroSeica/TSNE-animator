[Splinter from "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" sample]
The path that leads to what we truly desire is long and difficult
But only by following that path do we achieve our goal

[Holocaust]
How a firefighter died battling a suspicious blade
The darts that are genius, from the sun you witness rays
We are all the trees in this forest zone
Watch you go between us in a day
I'm the illest, destruction night, with spiked armor
You'll get killed, in a helmet
Like Lance-A-Lot, for the pass wound that will not heal
There's nothing alive for ten miles, don't start
At keeping your heart, three sharp knives
Throws your books off to betray criminal gang members
As colorful people who lead exciting lives
Electric cardio gram chasing is of one normal heartbeat
Twenty two writers imagine the future
The criminals urge is supremely calculating sometimes
A colony of leaf-cutter ants can strip a whole tree bare in just one night
Barons of the sky, aspects of the dark side
You were giving to execution

[Pro the Leader]
We the best G's of death

[G-Clef Da Mad Komposa]
Sacrifice sleep no need for rest

[Pro the Leader]
My verses submerge to go more in depth
Don't get ahead of yourself, you just my protege
Try to defeat me, you'll try until you're old and grey
The wild time your mind, wither away
Alter state of mind, display the blown away, to a haters dismay
Iron fist leave a crater in your face
Give up the goods and what you got stored in the briefcase
Feel the sonic blasts from my hands like Ultron
They made over the wall of the fortress but didn't trip the alarm
Silent thieves are violent in the seas
A sports athlete, thought he was the shit until he tore a tendon in his knee
MVP, on top of the world, now he's history
Just like that, it can be all gone instantly
Remember what bridges you burn, because on your way back down
You'll get what you deserve
Lessons hard earned, can't regain trust
Once it's gone, greatness was thrust upon me

[Weapon X]
The mainstream is shallow, narrow prophets righteous
Get defeated if divided, then raise off the face of the Earth
Like previous empires
Destructive desires that boil deseases to the heart
Force to disembark
You best seven scars, worth space you like shot spenders
And leave you injured, there's no convincing the ignorant
Sever path that is significant as nature, what's in my heart
Can't be contained, there's rage in my pages
You live in vein until your life's wasted
Why on this choir by great things, not the material chasing
Regret the days that remain a fret to the brain
And cause an upset like witness in the departure of relative
Changing negative to positive, the opposite of what you fought
Receive the impact without a chorus
I force rodents to retreat to the corners
The stress left til that self destructive nature, expose themself to danger
Came from something strange to go back to being a stranger
With a mental that froze a threat to their existance
Only til you step back and see what's self inflicted
I seen from a distance, you need to be indifferent

[Dopestyle]
Check it, from the fountain of youth, fire in the mic booth
Hot spit, roast MC marshmellow
Niggas that be shallow, now come and follow
Round Sleepy Hollow, below in the gallows
Stubborn on the ship, yo, what is this?
See, it's a hole, yes, we will sink
And see a nigga cry, locked in the brink
Below watch your pressure, crushing the ship
So what other D, can he withstand
Me Sub-Mariner, black Aquaman
Man from Atlantis, living in a shady town
Underwater, smoking a pound</pre>
