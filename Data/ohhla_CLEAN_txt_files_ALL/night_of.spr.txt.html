VERSE 1

When the night falls
And all the children's parents turn their lights off
A fog is building where the afterlife calls home
Where the white carved stones
Cover almost every inch of fine lawn grown
Half the people fast asleep and dreamin' all their nice thoughts
Alley cats are creepin', shriekin' awful night songs
It almost seems as if the teeny hints of life's gone
The secret is that anyone believin' this is quite wrong
Cause that's when the freaks come out
Seize the town and people scream and shout
When the peeps six feet deep leave the ground
To leap around the street to the beats and sounds
There's nothing that'll keep 'em down
Or make 'em go back into the tomb and stay 
Cause as long as the music plays then it moves the graves
That's what you call radioactive

CHORUS

Start tremblin'
Your heart rate descends and then
Your skin is leatherin'
Then you're dead again
That's when we begin to roam
And rock out from the catacomb

VERSE 2

All hell's breakin' loose
Tell satan to vamoose
We're celebratin' spooks
Elevatin' ghouls and the ghosts in white
Into the high rankin' socialites who control the night
We're supposed to frighten most just like them poltergeists
Little kiddies close their eyes, older guys are so surprised
When they see the folk's arisin' dudes stay stiller
Statuesque to have your legs like two great pillars
It's a new wave "Thriller" 
When the dance floor chants for the doomsday chiller
You might be sick but lou's way iller
While you're tryin' to write a hit, my group makes killers
Who's to say bein' dead's no fun

I guess no one, spooks can play too 
But they get no sun when the red glow comes
The cemetary empties like techno clubs

BRIDGE

There's no get away
There's no get away
There's no get away
From the dead awake

CHORUS

Start tremblin'
Your heart rate descends and then
Your skin is leatherin'
Then you're dead again
That's when we begin to roam
And rock out from the catacomb
