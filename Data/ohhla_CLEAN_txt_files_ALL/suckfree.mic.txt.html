[Chorus 2X: Apocalipps]
Stay the fuck away from me, I'm trying to stay sucka free
And, none of ya'll niggas getting nothing from me
It's a war going on, in the streets every day
And that's why I got something to say

[Truck]
Too many cops nowadays, somebody snitching in the hood
Fuck a high impact, I'm still pitching in the hood
White tee, flight jacket, pair of Air Force One's
Five dimes to this fiend for this sawed off gun
It'll only come out, if you dare cross son
Soon as I pull the fucking trigger, I advise ya'll run
I come through in a crack head car, nigga, fuck yo Benz
I'm not really impressed by your corny ass rims
You get stomped out here, with these convertible Timbs
I got a short temper, and I'm known to get bored quick
For no reason at all, I might start some shit
These taxes is high, these streets is hectic
And I salute them muthafuckas who them detectives
An eye for an eye, nigga, tooth for a tooth
You wanna play undercover, then prepare for the truth
Ain't no respect, pull out the tech, place it on ya neck
I want it all, nothing less, just for wreck

[Apocalipps]
Haha, I feel what you saying, nigga
Aiyo, I'm still gon' sell records, and ya'll gon' kick dirt
And show up at my platinum party with the Fuck Lipps shirt
Ya'll see me every day, I know you wanna pop my top off
I'm too thorough, ran everybody on ya block off
You can't call jake, muthafucka, I paid the cops off
You probably wait til the Source Awards to try to pop off
You camera gangsta, you don't be rapping, you acting
So save that shit for the silver screen
Cuz my guns is all real, when they peel, you scream
I send a bad bitch with AIDS to go and kill ya team
And if you play me on wax, when I see you, I'mma clap you
I don't do this shit for fun, I do this shit because I have to
Either this rap shit, or do sticks and jack, ya finished
The state caught me for 5 years, 3 days, and 20 minutes
And they won't get another second, Pataki bought this record
To read a mind of nigga thoughts that's crime infested
My necklace, it wasn't bought with cash
It got these big ass diamonds that can cut through glass
And my pockets got paper, that can plush ya lab
But my toast got shells that can crush your ass
I had to cut my lieutanent cuz he knew too much
Yo, in my hood they call me Kobe, cuz I shoot too much
Don't ever sleep on them cats, from the Ferry and shit
I put your mic in the casket and bury that shit

[Chorus 2X]

[Iron Mic]
Yo, I show love, spit slugs, sell drugs for a living
We grown thugs, started off as hard headed ass children
Poverty stricken, you gangsta, you gotta be kidding
I was raised with them wild cats, you polly with kittens
You don't know where ya man, he probably missing
Probably tied up in the back of the truck, probably bitching
Probably chopped up in the reservoir, body with fishes
Ruthless is for the streets, sow it up like stitches
Now throw it up, rep ya district, grab ya biscuit
What's the use of having a gun, you ain't gon hit shit
A nigga told me self defense, that ain't make no sense
Soon as the shots lit off, he ducking under the bench
And hopping, over the fence, dropping all of his rent
He lived the savage lifestyle, now it's time to repent
It's time to pay the piper, and I ain't talking bout cash
You pay the price with ya ass found dumped in the trash
And we don't dead the drama, nigga, we dead the drama
With lead and armor, word to the father
What I write is real, leave you dead on the altar
It's my life, my world, and I'm the author
When I rap it's torture, you don't wanna cross us
What you know about them grimey Staten Island New Yorkers
Bring guns to ya office, biting niggas get off us
Gangsta lifestyle, it prepares to boss us

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
