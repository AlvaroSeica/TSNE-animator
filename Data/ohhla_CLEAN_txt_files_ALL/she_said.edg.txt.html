[Verse 1: Ed O.G.]
Coolin at a club I seen a girl I wanted to stick it to
Well, I seen a few, but this one I had to kick it to
So I stepped to her, threw a couple and a few of
My lines to sedate her
Hm... she grabbed her coat and her bag, we left five minutes later
Yo, if she was a door I wouldn't knock like a neighbor in peace
I'd treat her like a drug house and bang like the police
Now at the crib the lights are dim, the music is soft
I said, "You know what we're here for, so take those off"
By now she's butt-naked, I'm ready to break it
Threw on the jim hat, I'm ready for trim, and all that
So I did it up, oo-wee, homes, I lit it up
After I was done, she almost didn't get up
Then she got up on her feet, sweat me like a dog in heat
I knew it was comin, I didn't even have to run it
(She said it was great, she said she's glad we had done it)	--&gt; Slick Rick
(She said it was great, she said she's glad we had done it)
(She said it was great, she said she's glad we had done it)

[Verse 2: Ed O.G.]
Ridin in a car with T-Nyne, Slim Dog and Darren
We stopped at a red light, this girl started starin
At me, I was in the fuss, so I said
"Excuse me, could you pull over, please?"
Right down ( ? ) in the heart of the 'Bury
I said to myself I'ma show this girl the meaning of my dic-tionary
She was dressed in black with a pair of riding boots
A Chinese top with a nice ( ? ), she was cute
She wasn't like a radio, so I couldn't turn her down
I got her address and said I be over after sundown
Night had fallen, Edo  G wasn't stallin
I was over the crib, ready to place my bib
She was def/ man, you shoulda saw her
I rode them riding boots like a brother ride a ( ? )
She was the perfect match, and I was ready to strike it
Huggin on my jimmy tellin me how much she liked it
(She said it was great, she said she's glad we had done it)
(She said it was great, she said she's glad we had done it)
(She said it was great, she said she's glad we had done it)

[Verse 3: Ed O.G.]
Late one night I was with Kenny and Mike
We was ridin through Morton Street projects
Just cruisin around, foolin around
And then we saw a couple of female subjects
All of our eyes looked their way, standin in the doorway
With nothin on but two tight little negliges
So we stopped the car, got out cause we was trickin
Kenny and Mike wasted no time, they walked right up and started kickin
As if they had been there, pretendin to live there
Helping hands, but it was really just to get in there
Then they got in and left a brother all alone
K said, "Hey yo Edo, then you can use my car phone"
So I'm talkin on the phone thinkin this is ill
After a 30 minute ( ? ) K said, "You're runnin up my phone bill
Come inside maxin," he didn't even have to run it
(She said it was great, she said she's glad we had done it)
(She said it was great, she said she's glad we had done it)
(She said it was great, she said she's glad we had done it)

[Verse 4: Ed O.G.]
Rollin in two Jeeps, and both of them were Cherokees
Feelin like nuts we all wanted to get skeezed
So Teddy Ted and Special K
Led the way to a place where we could all get paid
Where the goods were like rugs, just waitin to get laid
So we stayed, tryin to decide on
Who would have who, and which girl wanted to ride on
His jim, one got up and kissed Glen
And took him in a room, goddamn he's in
Teddy Ted and Special K was already bonin
In a room with two girls who was yellin and moanin
And that left me, Fish, T, Cruz and Joe
Me and Cruz got hooked up so we looked up and g-o
G and Joe was waitin, sittin and debatin like troops
While Fish got up so he could step into some boots
So now it's two left tryin to get into the hoes' clothes
Ted opened up the door and said (Kick the Willie Bobo)
So now we're all in, finished and done bonin
We jumped in the streets cause it's time to start rollin
Everybody's feelin happy cause it was kickin
So we stopped at the store to get some forties and chicken
If those girls was prizes, we woulda won it
They said it was great and they was glad we had done it
(She said it was great, she said she's glad we had done it)
(She said it was great, she said she's glad we had done it)
(She said it was great, she said she's glad we had done it)</pre>
