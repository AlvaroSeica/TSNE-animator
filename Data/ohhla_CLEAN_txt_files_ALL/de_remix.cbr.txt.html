[Verse One: Drake]
What you mean I ain't call you? I'll hit you when I landed
I'm waitin in my hotel room
Seems like we're arguin more and it's gettin less romantic
Yeah! I think she'll be able to tell soon
But I'll fuck you right I will, I'll fuck you right I will
I'll fuck you like no one has ever ever made you feel
I mean it's part of our relationships amazin still
I might just put up with the arguin and stay for real
You lookin bad, girl for goodness sakes
You with all those curves, and me without no brakes
Oooh!!! I'm willin to work it out however long it takes you
You feel like you missed those happy days 
Well girl that makes two of us, our timin is wrong
Your friends always tyin up every line on your phone
Yeah! But tell them bitches that you'll always be my misses
And the hardest part about the fuckin business is mindin your own
Uh! And everytime I try and break it off
We just yell until we're tired then I break you off
It's useless all this fightin let's get past it now
Even when I throw them deuces you just send her back around 

[Verse Two: T.I.]
Your wrist and fingers glisten, ice cold like Michigan
Hey look at what we livin in, here we go with this again
I just keep on talkin but I guess that you ain't listenin 
Rather run around with them nothin ass niggas then
'Gon on, got me hot, smokin like a chimney
We used to be best friends now it seems we fittin to be enemies
Deep inside it's killin me but soon it's 'gon be killin you
To see her in that two seater no that's 'gon hurt your feelings boo
Aah Haa!!! Didn't you, think you would be over me
By now so you go sleepin with them clowns they are no relief
She spoke her peace I know capeesh so love must be let go release
Into the wind begin again them deuces I must throw ya peace!!!

[Verse Three: Kanye West]
You know what yo? You a bitch
You should have a travel agent, cause you a trip
You should make your own toilet tissue since you the shit
But all you got is some fuckin issues you fuckin bitch
I hate bitches, but I love your mom
Give her a kiss for me, her second son
Get your mind right baby or get your shit together
You gon' be hot a little while, I'ma be rich forever
Girl seduces, they come in deuces
But when I cut 'em off, they always become a nuisance
Niggaz take my old flows and they take my old swag
He just took my old bitch and turned it to his new bitch
Haha, I'm stupid but I won't get my drama on
What I'm dealin with is too real, for me to comment on
Jay finally got it through my head not to run my mouth
So when y'all talk 'bout you-know-who I don't know who you talkin 'bout

[Verse Four: Fabolous] (Chris Brown)
According to my old bitch, I be on some new shit
She was on some old shit, now I got a new bitch
Think I give two shit, you ain't gon' do shit 
Meet my two fingers, intro -- deuces (deuces)
If you knew better, you'd do better 
When I give the middle finger, but I got two better
(So you gon' diss me, even though you know it's wrong, know you gon'...)
{"Miss me a little when I'm gone"
