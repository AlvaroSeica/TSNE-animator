Album:  The Digital Gangster LP
Song:   Other People's Property
Typed by: @mc_lars (Horris Records)

MC Lars:
Who's down with OPP? Yeah you know me
Remixed pastiche of other people's property
Because what do you do when your culture's predicated
On a cut and paste identity, straight up appropriated?
Who's back who's tight who's on tonight
Who's black who's white who's wrong who's right
Yeah I speak for a generation of lost kids
Who had stranger life than our parents ever did
We never had a Woodstock, Iraq is our Vietnam
So we colonized hip-hop, like Dutch dudes Suriname
A mullet on a b-boy, the flavor is intrinsic
If you've got the beat inside you, me feel me if you're with it
From Rolling Stone love to MTV
The thin line between Eminem and Ali G
Guess who just aced this hip-hop pop quiz?
MC Lars posting up laying claim to what's his

Chorus:
You down with OPP? Yeah you know me
Remixed pastiche of other people's property
Because what do you do when your culture's predicated
On a cut and paste identity, straight up appropriated?

K. Flay:
Racial politics every time I spit
Am I a colonist or am I legit?
Tip-toe the fine line, it's ill-defined I'm
Implicated in this mess all the time
The high jack took place way back the Blues Act
Taken by this white cat, he made mad cash
Is it appropriation? Or appreciation?
What kind of statement are we making?

YTCracker:
are they mad at me? assimilate the game like the borg
hatin' on me cuz I banged a couple keys on my korg
i twisted the paradigm took something and made it mine
but the way that I make 'em move they don't seem to mind
I'm a hip-hopper respect the roots
I'm a show stopper and that's the truth
i've been doing this rapping long enough to gain my tenure
get respect at my shows making legal tender

Repeat chorus:

Beefy:
Let me introduce myself, my name is Beefy kid
I'm from the Northwest 509 number one Whitesican
Been known to grab a mic and kill all challengers just with the flows
And with these nerdy lyrics got kids heads all up all at my shows
So because my lack of pigment makes my skin all light
Mean I can't grab a microphone and rip apart your face tonight?
That sounds ridiculous, you surly can't be serious
Cause Beefy is so magical I should just be called Severus
Judge me not by the way I appear
Be in your ear, striking fear into all of those insincere
Rap about pop culture, that's experimentation
But there are those that wanna strike me down for my pigmentation, what?
Don't you know that I've been hanging around
Going to town on these fellas by simply making a sound
But add my visual and audio becomes less important
You've got a stupid argument, I'd like to see ya support it
Not trying to put anyone down, not sayin' your not amazing
But when you just reverse the roles you see the trouble we're facing
People hatin', people saying I'm disgracing the form
I'm trying to elevate the culture, roll it out and transform</pre>
