[Pro the Leader]
Scarce, Mix Jive The Skarekrow, Professional, word, Leviathan
My only flaw is that I lend too many people a helping hand
When in return I should CHOP OFF YOURS....
Hence rhymes like these, lyrically hit you off with a variety
I just may vanish and never return AGAIN
My vocals transcend and intertwine with the mind
I never miss an opportunity, by now I feel it's the offer through time
What I'm going through to some is incomprehensible
I'm a blissen in the sky to a chosen few
The sun reflects off of the sea to make the sky blue
Uncontestable, impenetrable, unmatchable
I find you highly susceptible; hit you where you're vulnerable
WHAT YOU THINK OF ME NOW
Opportunity rejuvenates, get carried away by the beat
Your better off back tracking then to keep up with me
Know what I'm saying son
(aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa)
Replenish, it's a privilege
Feel the presence
Enter my dominion, this is my domain, take this under consideration
From now on I will keep my ideas concealed

[Leviathan]
Word up, (hell yeah) Professional
Yo, sipping on ganja and water as we roam through a forest
Black Panther cats on attack carrying torches
Camouflage in brown and green, we wolverines
Catapulting gasoline, blow your tanks to smithereens
Skull mask with gattling-guns who's got you on the run
Professional, Monstar mob, World War One
Propel flares to the air, shine brighter then times square
Lyrics eat through the flesh; in hip-hop the war is fair
West Coast across our vest, we bomb with heavy artillery
Built for this, stampede through cross breeds
Because these deadly poems shatter your dome and scatter your bones
While violent tones guide you out this combat zone

[Onslot]
Yeah, I'm doing my thing mother fucker
Stupid niggas make me wanna pull a thing mother fucker
Onslot the magnificent, you niggas insignificant
You stuck in one place; need to get smacked in the face
Yall aint got no ambition; yall aint got no fucking heart
You stand around looking stupid and be thinking that you smart
Aint getting no richer, can't see the big picture
Running around broke as fuck thinking yous a real nigga
I aint gunna front I'm broke too but that shit is temporary
I'm going places mother fucker, cause I'm willing and I'm ready
And a nigga can't be stopped; I'm hot like my block with drugs
But my slugs are even hotter if I pop you in your mug
Hit you with a thirty-eight; leave a crater in your face
Then disappear with out a trace, so I never catch a case
I'm moving forward and you hating niggas moving to the back
Stay out my face or feel the impact of a fucking maniac

[Outro: Pro the Leader]
Yeah, that's right
Professional, Leviathan, Black Sun... Onslot, Skarekrow
Be on the look out for The Next Installment</pre>
