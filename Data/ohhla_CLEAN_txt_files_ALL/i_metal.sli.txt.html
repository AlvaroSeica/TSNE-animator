Typed by: AZ Lyrics

You've got a hold on me
My addiction's slowly choking me
Till my eyes pop
And they're bloodshot
Life is punk rock
Just let me go
No, cause you won't let me
So I won't let you forget me, let's see
I'm gonna get this shit till you direct me
After that, make like
You never met me
Fuck this, I'm destructed
Stick around and you're
Pushin' your luck, bitch
And I'm willing
To start killing
What more can I say?
Yes (something)
Guess what I got?
You got it?
Good
And since it's understood
Could you
Stop stealing, or I'm (something)
All I want to do is tornado through the mosh pit
Just let me (Juts let me go) [x4]
(Sir, you need to calm down.)
I don't want to, you can't make me
I seem to go wherever music takes me
You can hate me
Agitate me
But never should you under estimate me
(No)
Oh, how it feels to be knocked down
I got this site under lock down
What now, I'm going all out
With a deranged flow
Don't think I might cause I'm ready to go</pre>
