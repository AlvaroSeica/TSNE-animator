[Chorus 2X]
Girl, ya been touched by the forces of nature
I'm just tryna motivate ya 
Electricity is definitely there
I got shocked when I touched your hair
Sex 4 suga, suga 4 sex
Sex 4 suga, suga 4 sex
Sex 4 suga, suga 4 sex
Sex 4 suga, suga 4 sex

[Common - Verse 1ne]
Girl...ooh, you look uh!
You're the type of thick that I cain't give up
What's your name? I cain't hear ya
Will it be alright if I called you Suga?
You could call me +Smokey+, I'll be the +Bear+
Your smell is sexy, it's all in the air
Whatcha got girl? It's so unfair
I like the way you move so keep it right there
or you can do what you wanna do
I'm just glad I'm in front of you
But I don't mind bein behind
'cause I'ma touch you where the sun don't shine!
Got my hand on the money while you on the grind
In tune with you, 'cause you so fine
And when you wine it's genu-wine
Get on my vine and we can climb

[Chorus 2X]

[Common - Verse 2wo]
Heard you used to dance at Magic Ci-tay
The other girls couldn'ta been half as pret-tay
You look so sexy when you grab them -
OOOOOOOH!!!...oh, yes!
Suga good Lord, you've been blessed
If this is a sin, I must confess
The way you dress, is like birdless
I guess you don't mind bein undressed
I like the way it's goin down
Hips are movin all around
Round and round, upside down
I once was lost but now I'm found!
Sweetheart, can you give me another round?
Sweatin like you losin pounds
Touch the ground, makin sounds
Suga ooh Suga, you wear the crown

[Chorus 2X]

[Common - Verse 3hree]
All that dancin, Suga.. 
Make me want ta do ya..
The way you move and shake it
Ah ah, on the dance flooooo'
Wanna touch and feel ya... 
We can get fa-mil-ar...
The way you move and shake it
Make me wantchu some moooo'....
Ooh, you makin my nature rise
We can do more than fantasize
Let's do the do, me and you
We can whoa-ooh, WHOA-OOH, WHOA!! and whoopty whoo
Your physique brings out my freak
I like the way yo' bod-ty speaks
I want some of you everyday of the week
Suga Suga, you ain't nuttin sweet, uh!

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
