Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro]
I ain't tripping off no pussy
Freeband Gang

[Chorus]
I'm flying first class flights on these pussy niggaz
I just found that was yo wife I got that pussy nigga
I rock a whole lot of ice on a pussy nigga
I'm changing up my foreign cars on these pussy niggaz
I'm balling like I'm in the NBA on pussy niggaz
I'm kicking shit in Louie like a soccer ball nigga
You see me splurging on my nerves &amp; to these pussy niggaz
I got my check &amp; I be working on these pussy niggaz

[Verse 1]
I'm living larger, the richer part or I'm spitting lava
I'm getting that paper, I ain't slowing down, nigga I enjoy it
When you get famous they hate it, its like you can't avoid it
I'm in the front of plane sitting right next to the driver
You ain't nothing but some cheap pussy lil nigga I'll buy ya
I got em scared, I'm attacking niggaz like Michael Myers
I be directicting my own movies, I'm Future Tyler
I stay connected, I'm shipping it, I'm my own supplier
I get to moving &amp; flipping it, set the trap on fire
You cooking dope &amp; shoot pistols well then you getting higher
You got to know how to sell whatever thats all required
I'm looking at all these niggaz funny, Richard Pryor

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I got my feet up, I'm kicking it like I'm David Beckham
Ima' keep it trill nigga, I'm on another level
V &amp; G And BBG I'm folding Versace sweaters
They want me to be the one to take them up out the ghetto
I can't take no sauce my nigga I'm trying to stack it tall
I was talking to the pilot, by then we taking off
I just left the city, got some head from the flight attendant
I'm in a grill like a dentist &amp; all my clips extended
I put the ice in the chain thats how they recommend it
I don't know these bitches name, I know these bitches switching
They go smash me cause I'm Future nigga cause I ain't tricking
If she worthy Ima' let her fly with me, long distance

[Chorus]</pre>
