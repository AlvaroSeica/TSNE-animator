[Verse 1]
I'm all up in your brain like (drugs)
Robbie Burns-style chilling in these winter woods
Kinda humanist, all I really want is good
I feel hate sometimes but I suppress them thoughts
Now some people don't and their face contorts
And other folks won't, it's their main support
On the pavement screwing at the slightest nudge
Petty grudge, harsh words, so quick to judge
Everybody here whispers on the bus
Paranoid eyes look away
If you cause a fuss still get away
No-one's up for looking out for who's next door
Want a quiet life rather never see the poor
Spare change? Not likely we can just afford a glance
By the cashpoint tramps with the drunken dance
And we'd like to help, but I'm trying to get rich
And I'm going for self and yeah life's a bitch
Don't you know it - we feel ashamed but won't show it
Is the difference I take my chance and you blow it?
I do believe in the power of choice
But through the outside pressure can you keep your voice ?

[Chorus]
I'm only here cos I'm tryin' to get out
I'm only certain that I'm living in doubt
I'm only here cos I'm tryin' to get out
I'm only certain that I'm living in doubt
Move yourself, wake up like know yourself
Stay you then grow your wealth
I know the negative shit don't help, come on move yourself

[Verse 2]
Living with the aftershock of a million woes
Now who's quick to mock like their heart just froze
And waves splash the rocks like the land erodes
Like the liver rots slow when the brandy flows
Or egos melt when you're all alone
And your friends are props that nowadays don't phone
Debt strips men down, takes away your house,
disregards your class and anulls your credit rating
We sit debating who's playa-hating
And think life's hard cos the heating's broke
So the cold's penetrating while I'm tapping on the Playstation
It's all relative
We stay neutral and never give
That Sky Digital shit is like a sedative
I watch the news and stay thankful for how I live
So why the hell can't I help this man
with the nerve to approach me with an empty hand
Put some money in them little envelopes for charity
It could be me in 5 years clinging on to sanity
The only truth's that there is no truth
So don't judge me and I won't judge you

[Chorus]
I'm only here cos I'm tryin' to get out
I'm only certain that I'm living in doubt
I'm only here cos I'm tryin' to get out
I'm only certain that I'm living in doubt
