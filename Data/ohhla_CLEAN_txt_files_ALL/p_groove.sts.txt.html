[Chorus: MC Delite]
On fire, on fire, on fire
On fire, on fire, on fire
On fire, on fire, on fire

[Daddy-O]
We were born to be on, got strong and life-long
Our element of song, could never steer you wrong
We attack like a fleet, and burn like the heat
We win like a champ and the victory is sweet
We drive like a drill, we soothe like a pill
We consume till we're filled, opposition is nill
We speak to attain unattainable feats, and I'm rockin to the beat
Y'all and you don't quit, as I rely solely upon my wit
To help me say this rhyme for I forget
And rock much parties till skies are lit
Cause it's a sure hit from my rhymin' kit
While other MC's takin a stand I sit
And if a jam gets ill I'll deal with it
Cause I'm as hot as hot could ever get
And I'm not a nitwit when I throw a Stet fit
I hear em yellin and yellin (Daddy-O is legit)
And I don't smoke crack cause I'm not with it
The crew is crack-free and we'll admit it
Stet's been stickin out a stake for style
And on the mic we a-fi wicked and sometimes wild
We are the ones that'll take you higher
We're the band called Stet (my man) and we're on fire
