[Verse One]
Yo, yo
Phat instrumental
Coincidental 
Dwellin' in my laboratory in my mental
Concoctin', set to rock spots high
Do it another time, the rhymes is sho' shot
Fire burn flame remain just like God
Livin' everyday of my life can be hard
Leave the mic charred and scared we fought
Get played out and layed out, my job
Yo, deep in the city
Brothers get busy
The windmill will make your head get dizzy
19-99 I will design
A spacecraft blast
Off in rhyme
We gon' shine
Off the flight
With the lyrics of light, spark the insight
Say +Dynomite+ like my name J.J.
With the rhyme that I say to rock your party 
Hey

[Chorus]
I'm a B-Boy that's all that I am
Step into the party with the fire proof plan
Come on everybody say "whoo"
Come on, time to revolute
Yo, I'm a B-Boy that's all that I is
Step into the party gotta build the pyramid
Come on everybody say "free"
Come on y'all say, "me"

[Verse Two] 
Now I take my time
When I rhyme
When I start I bust I trust that mankind
Will grant me space
Explore the place
I'm the ace in the hole with the soul to chase
I'm unexplainable
I let my rhymes just glide
Slip off my lips and grip your inside
Momma don't cry
Poppa don't cry
Spread your wings
Let your backbone slide
This is one Zion I, we can see to the sun
Everyone get on cause here come
The promise land
With the wind I command
My life span expand by two grand
And two mo' fo'
Ride till it's gold
Hold the globe with the soul beautiful
Spirit style make the flow sound wild
Versatile cause God bless the child
Say

[Chorus]
I'm a B-Boy that's all that I am
Step into the party with the fire proof plan
Come on everybody say "whoo"
Come on, time to revolute
Yo, I'm a B-Boy that's all that I is
Step into the party gotta build the pyramid
Come on everybody say "free"
Come on y'all say, "me"

[Verse Three]
Now I always wear camo
Spit rhyme ammo
Boost the juice, get loose in the ghetto
Everybody need to breath and be free
And grab the style chi for more energy
Femininity
Masculinity
Come into the party let me get you obvi
Take off your coat
Promote my black vote
I wrote a dope rhyme so let the line float
Yo
Like a boat crossed rivers of pain
On the other side peace, release is the aim
Let it vibrate
My people co-create
So the last sit back, dance and meditate

[Chorus]
I'm a B-Boy that's all that I am
Step into the party with the fire proof plan
Come on everybody say "whoo"
Come on, time to revolute
Yo, I'm a B-Boy that's all that I is
Step into the party gotta build the pyramid
Come on everybody say "free"
Come on y'all say, "me"

"Yeah y'all come on" - Public Enemy

[Verse Four]
Yo, yo
Now I'm standin' at the edge of a brave new world
B-boys &amp; girls, let your magic twirl
2 G till you see what it got to be
All my seeds will speak through telepathy
The ability to face shit through hard ways
Will amaze, in the last days things will change
All the cold blooded things is transformin'
Brethren, have to celebrate the morning
Can't trip off that
Got to live today
Never promised tomorrow, got to make a way
So I sit on back
Think 'bout the past
The last on the track

[Chorus]
I'm a B-Boy that's all that I am
Step into the party with the fire proof plan
Come on everybody say "whoo"
Come on, time to revolute
Yo, I'm a B-Boy that's all that I is
Step into the party gotta build the pyramid
Come on everybody say "free"
Come on y'all say, "me"
