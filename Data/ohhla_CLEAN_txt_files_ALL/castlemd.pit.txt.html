Song:   Castle Made of Sand
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Intro: Kelly Rowland]
So you tried, to believe
in the castle made of the sand
When it falls, to the seat
And your feet can't find dry land
Reach for my hand

[Pitbull]
I sacrificed my life to give you my life in speakers
That's right I do good even though I've been crossed like Jesus
God knows I've got a good heart, but my blood's filled with demons
I'm fighting myself... believe me
I'm, far from ignorant, far from greedy
If you, knew what I come through, knew what I been through
You'd think there should have been another outcome
Just like most kids a father I, did it without one
Come from the city where they'll, X you like Malcolm
Then you wonder how come, I can move
in a room full of wolves, so swift, so smooth
Thank you mom, for makin me a man
Let a motherfucker knock down my castle in the sand

[Chorus: Kelly Rowland]
So you tried, to believe
in the castle made of the sand
When it falls, to the seat
And your feet can't find dry land
Reach for my hannnnnnd
Reach for my hannnnnnd

[Pitbull]
I've lived my whole life with the world on my shoulders
So I can care less what this music game throws us
I see them lookin for narckitties but they won't find it
I come from struggle, I'm a fighter, must you be reminded?
My mother's past has a trap has her blinded
But I took her past it, I took her pain
I made it strength, I fought the game
Do or die, Pitbull's the name
Now all I see is the future
Mom I love you, I salute you
And no matter what happens
Just know you the reason I'm rappin

[Chorus]

[Jamie Drastik]
Look~! I'm from the home of the spitters, the winners, the Big Apple
Came down to South Beach to build a new castle
Every day I'm hustlin and every day you hassle
Doin what you can't and I'm doin what I have to
Throw me in the jungle and I'll show you I'm a winner
I'm comin out with dinner and wearin a chinchilla
I did it for my town to show 'em the big picture
Pit hit the switch, I promise to never switch up
This is for my brother, took three and went to jail
I'm sendin all the pictures of my shows through the mail
He hit me with a letter said I know you'll never fail
So put me on a beach with a bucket and a pail

[Chorus]</pre>
