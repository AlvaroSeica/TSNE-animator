[Mr. Lif]
Baby boy, girl Â– Daddy loves you with a world of strength
But my thoughts of holdin you in my arms remain at arm's length
See I was raised with romanticism, around a tradition
which states a man should have some children with his wisdom
And your suspected mommy to be
More beautiful than any woman I could wish to see standin next to me
Intelligent, wise, beautiful eyes helps my intellect rise
through lows and highs, makes me love bein alive
I've been dreamin 'bout your life since early teenage years
durin a haze of beer and blunts; I envisioned you once
Immaculate black skin, me providin what you're lackin
Us coolin out, watchin flicks, laughin
Then your image disappeared, in a cloud of my fear
You're not here, but I've got some things I want you to hear
I'm scared I can't provide or survive on my own
Let alone build you a solid home where love's shown
Please allow me private moments as I gather this poem
May this pen commit to paper my emotions and zones
I'm on the highway in Montana and it's 7:42
And daddy wrote a rhyme just for you

[Chorus One: Mr. Lif]
If there's one thing in this life that I do hope to achieve
It's to give you all my love and make you strong before I leave
Just for you (you) just for you (you)
Just for you...

[Mr. Lif]
What can I say next? In '81 I wore a pair of gray specs
In '86 I started pumpin rap up in my tape deck
A younger music, then MC's would recommend
knowledge of self, to help uplift and we'd ascend
So I send similar, messages to my listeners
beyond perimeters, they advance to the rhythm of
a kick, snare, and hi hat; the masses won't buy that
It's drug sales and gun claps, so less loot's what I stack
I know the flow of cash ain't all that it would take
for you and I to form a bond so strong it'd never break
But I couldn't stand havin nothin in my hand in the time of your need
It's understood so shall I proceed?
Indeed there's many other factors that do come into play
That make me hesitate to bring you to this world of today
See there's a sense of desperation from miseducation
Which leaves our highest aimin far below required expectations
To play a plain hand is, the usage of language
Power's locked in codes so most misunderstand it
Major corporations plan to dwarf the layman
Our president's a profit margin; greed is growin strong and
It's just a mental death condition spawned by logo recognition
Dollar signs squalor minds, the prison's beyond our visions
I identify a piece and write it down on a page
Pray to God and hope for strength to practice healthier ways
Please pardon if I ramble through the course of this poem
May this pen commit to paper my emotions and zones
I'm on the highway out in Cali, it's 11:42
And daddy wrote a rhyme just for you

[Chorus One]

[Chorus Two: Mr. Lif]
But you're not here because I fear what's in the future I perceive
Got me shakin so I made a little song I'm gonna leave
Just for you (you) just for you (you)
Just for you...

[Mr. Lif]
I had to take a long hiatus from writin this song
Thought of you while I was gone
Though my feelings vary, yes I'll carry on
Larry, Sean, Diana, Dawn; shit I'll leave it up to Mom
No idle title vital, strong; strength to help you move along
Healthy self-esteem without a selfish dream
Who got you thinkin wealth is green, I see you starin at that screen
Well it's a black hole, it's used to extract soul
Thought it was neat, kept the receipt and I'm 'bout to take it back though
My mind roams through burnin homes, worldwide war zones
Cremation of the last generation before clones
If you should run into yourself on the street
Lie then press delete, dye your hair and change your physique
Unique survival pack words, when life walks backwards
A rocky road that doesn't lack curves meant to rack nerves
True, humankind has made life a disgrace
But there's one thing that may keep you alive in this place
Love may be found if your feet are on the ground
Follow your heart but stop and start to take a look around
Swear that's all that keeps me goin, love of flowin
Love of family plus G-O-D, all seein and all knowin
Pardon if I'm psycho when I'm writin alone
May this pen commit to paper my emotions and zones
I'm in Mexico, chillin with an oceanfront view
And daddy wrote a song just for you

[Chorus One] + [Chorus Two]

[Michelle Shaprow - repeat 2X]
Baby boy, your life should fulfill your dreams
Just follow your heart and you'll get what you want every moment
Always gon' be there, there for you, you, you
Baby girl, your life should fulfill your dreams
Just do what you love and you'll love what you do every moment</pre>
