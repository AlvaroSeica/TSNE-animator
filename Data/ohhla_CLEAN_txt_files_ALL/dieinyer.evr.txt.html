[Everlast]
Girl, I wanna die in yer arms tonight
I really don't care 'bout the wrong or right
The fruit is forbidden but it's sweet and it's ripe
Think I'm gon' pick me some and take me a bite
Baby girl looks so good, she walks so mean
Got a vicious little sway, I think she's semi-obscene
She'll pick your bones clean, oh my God she's so fine
She sweeter than the dew out on the grapes on the vine
I'ma pick her, I'm a squeeze her, I'ma make me some wine
And I'ma drink her 'til I'm crazy, I'ma drink 'til I'm blind
And I'ma touch her so good, I'ma treat her so fine
I'ma gonna make love to her soul, I'm gonna fuck all with her mind

[Chorus]
I'm gonna die in yer arms tonight
I really don't care 'bout the wrong or right
The fruit is forbidden, but it's sweet and it's ripe
Think I'm gon' pick me some and take me a bite

[Everlast]
Baby girl acts so proper, like daddy's little daughter
A wolf in sheep's clothin leadin lambs out to the slaughter
She's lookin so young, she's smellin so pretty
She's a junkie on a binge and her drug is the city
She's a vicious little bitty, her attitude is shitty
And if I get my way, she probably gonna come home with me
Talkin good for nothin, eyes weren't made for cryin
Bombs were made for droppin girl yer arms are made for dyin
I'ma die in yer arms tonight
I really don't care 'bout the wrong or right
The fruit is forbidden, but it's sweet and it's ripe
Think I'm gon' pick me some and take me a bite

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Die in yer arms tonight
Don't care 'bout the wrong or right
Forbidden but it's sweet and it's ripe
Pick me some and take me a bite</pre>
