[Bronze Nazareth]
I came to this Earth in the form of a raindrop
One out of seven millions, so how'd I make to this spot?
In an orphan dock, world that I painfully touch
Through the clearliness of one eye, my visions are corrupt
Think I landed in the force of cold watered Michigan
Used to shine down on humans like Lost Friends
Evolving from a jewelry place to the Earth dreary face
Teary laced, could barely see over the grass blades
Cracked ashtrays, polluted pathways of the mitt
Chunks of tree bark missed with the shotgun's slugs hitting
But before me, it's definitely hitting by night
I see your body with torn jeans and blood spluttered NIKE
Scaling my eyes over this demise man, what's inside me cries
My size tinted red I'm in the blood puddle Eli
It's ungodly how these humans take lie
It's the old harmony, they should burn right
But then burn out, loosing Illuminati
Life's harder like Socrates martyring in the garden
More like flowing then rhyme
Don't kill his footprints, surround 'em
Or riff the picture, outstanding
My father got the world drowning
Died with his eye probing like somebody he knew smoked 'em
Hoping I could help but all I could do is just glance
No more rain dance
Until this glow finally understands that I give beauty
But also I birth poisonous plants
Pictures of his voice in his hands make me wanna evaporate
I wish these trees could talk so they could elaborate
It's raining; it's raining; it's raining...

(Chorus) Mary J. Blige "It's Goin' Down" sample
Rain, rain, rain
Driving me insane
Rain, rain, rain
Driving me insane
Rain, rain, rain
Driving me insane
Rain, rain, rain
Driving me insane

[Kevlaar 7]
A reincarnated raindrop, filtered down from peaks in mountain tops
Cascaded in the form of glocks, life cycle's faded
I appear on men's faces
Witness more than a generation of safety erases
I embody violence, the silence with no eyelids
Observing the sailings in pain of the victim's cries
I rest in puddles alongside my brothers
And when I lay on branches, I observe the masses
Create confusion, I was born in the sky
Results of white tone gaseous fusion
So when I grew I became a lost teardrop
And knew the filthiness of this drowning world would put an end to this
It's all blur, I was burden into a world that was burning
And I refuse to be part of this negative love
So when I landed, I just marinated in the sun
Bullets cut straight through H2O with no damage
I just manage, disbursement with no drainage
This world is tainted, execute my own carnage
Separate parts of me start to rye, and I prophesize
Human kind will understand these words when I died
Think, evaporation, holy sacred nation
Open up your eyes, it's raining; it's raining...

(Chorus) </pre>
