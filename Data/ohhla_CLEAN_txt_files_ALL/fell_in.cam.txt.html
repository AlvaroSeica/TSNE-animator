[Chorus]
you done fell in love wit a thug
you in trouble baby
you done fell in love wit a thug
it ain't a damn thing a damn thing you can do about it

Lord knows its been hard wit boo
you stuck by a nigga like glue
its true that I done fucked up plenty of times and you forgave me
thats why I'm here for you baby
when I went to jail you was there phone calls and visits
tshirts and underwear lil ma you did it
when I came home it was the same song
out on the corner all night still tryna get my hustle on
you hate it but you still waited up until I made it in
questionin where the hell I been
and then came the love makin and the tounge kissin
on a mission to hit that ass in every position
wishin for peace love and happiness
are you happy (yes)
well lay your tired head on my chest
get you some rest
everything gonna be aight
but what
I know it feel like you hooked on drugs
cause

[Chorus]

I see you blowin up my phone
sayin make it home you all alone
give me about a hour uh oh I caught the dial tone
another argument wit me and my boo
I spend more time in the streets than I do wit you
but hey I gotta get it how I live baby
im tryna give you nice things and pay these bills baby shit
ya home girl said she seen me at the club fuckin wit some chickenheads
oh you gonna follow her up damn
what ever happened to that thing called trust
what ever happened to that thing called us
guess what
we got to make this thing worth it shit
I ain't even gotta tell you what you did

[Chorus]

Whoa now slow down lil ma whats your problem
I hope that I can try to help ya solve em
boo listen I know you upset I understand (you don't wanna work time in)
but shit I'm out here everyday tryna make a better way for us hey
this life I'm livin its so dangerous ok
you think I'm chasin bitches
but I'm out here chasin riches
when I'm wit my niggas you figure I'm wit some bitches
damn how you wanna run back to your momma
dont you think she gettin tired of all this drama
cause you and I both know wassup
you gonna be right back where you was
cause

[Chorus]</pre>
