[Tech N9ne]
E-S-T is 1985
in KC on a bus ride from the fifty-sixth side
Not too many knew that it was alive
But they spread it, so now they tied to Technicians worldwide

Listen, trying to recruit is the mission
We offer you a position where Tech will rule and condition your brain
to know acting a fool is the vision, Caribou Lou is tradition
and the way to be true to your living is Strange
We come in peace, but if you wanna be dumb and beef
a gun is something he wanna be, young and speak, I'ma numb his beak
He's a woman, he's the one that, he brung in meat for the cunning beast
Hit a lung and seep dung, and sleep long and deep, tongue full of gum and teeth
It's when a Technician do the sets who diss the crew
The best thing is for you to do is to let the click see who
the vet is, and miss the new seekers
Wondering who the fuck is coming through these speakers
Never forget it, the medic for you tweakers
Ahead of the medicine developed to soothe creatures
You're pathetic if you're no believer
cause we all are energetic and eager
Come alive when you walking side by side with me
Fly the skies and get high with me
On this ride you won't collide, just confide in me
Try denying me, ye dying violently
That's the way, you fakers got to pay
My people quick to spray and buck a demon till they lay
But if he breathing, it must've been an angel by his side like Sunday
Never would be the case cause my click ready to ride when I say

[Chorus: Tech N9ne] + (Krizz Kaliko)
Technicians~!
Ah-ooh, ah-ooh, ah-ooh, others ain't got a clue
They coming through suspicious
We do, the shit, we do, cause if you not with the crew
converting you is our mission
(If you were born Technician, put your ammunition
 and your hands up in the sky
 This is a strong addiction, live to this if
 you're a Technician till ya die)

[Tech N9ne]
My people all know what a Bianca is
Most of 'em want to diss, don't come at us, you don't want the biz
It ain't nothing but real women in my circle, not them phoney chicks
that don't know what I mean when I say elbow macaroni bitch
They know what I'm drinking
The ladies looking right, they know what I'm thinking
The babies even hype, the oldies be geeking
The red, the black and white, the soldiers beef seeking
All of my peoples here
Tech and the bidness are gonna equal fear
cause I'm about to bubble and get the evil peers
out of my life, I never want to see you, yeah~!
Bitch, you ain't a Technician
You don't know the pledge but you said that you listen
Guess you misunderstood the shit, huh?
Disrespect that Tech, trick get done
The moral of the story is we warriors
Notorious for the hordes of core, ready to roar, he is glorious
Technician number one
The mission, leave 'em sprung with the tongue
and if you listen it's a gun

[Chorus]

[Tech N9ne]
We are family, that Tech shit, we on it
We could be damaging, to all you punks that want it
We bring calamity, that snake and bat, we flaunt it
Unforgettable, Tech's formidable, repping the Mid, you know bitch we run it~!
You don't gotta know that I really meant it
when I said that I was gonna make the mainstream go me
Still rapping like I'm popping a pillow, off of the killer
I'm on it like I was taking Molly in '03
We can take anybody we so deep, I bet that you got us on yo' street
I'm tryna find a spot that's big enough so all of my people can meet

[Chorus]</pre>
