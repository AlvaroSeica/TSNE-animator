soared into solitude, who can put away a lot of food
gorge to the restaurant, no desert man, I ordered meals
you can easily get beheaded
machete addict, send that ego slice to your neck and leave you offset
getting choreographical credit, I created these steps
__, slice to slash you on any rapper
you'll never catch me on meth, looking left
__, again across the street
walking by with traffic all up in my sex
getting paramedic tests
my life or risk my death
most would think __needs breath
do verbatim verbia, operate um, shame um
do um, pay frame um, then insulate them lets incubate um
daily, that's an accurate prep
__
lyrically sticky, hardly vadum
monopolizing by me, with omni up after me
cant touch the fastest speed, nice lyrical counter beat

shadows, hallucinating battles (x3)

welcome to milineum, meet my minion
time zones in and out of tunnels, drifting seconds
minutes reach them ashes
vintage, dirty denim, tinted glasses
you know my reputation, in any situation
I know the risk I'm taking, __
to break um, I have him on his knees
praying, hoping heaven take um
heart racing, start racing like you lost patience
shot chasing, all my lazy boys start dazing
shadows in the dark, angels on the marquee blazing
move to the heart beat of the city, bang with me one queen
one face card, king hit me bing
21, pinky ring, squeaky clean, _
digimon with the celly on his hip, chip quick
on the draw, also things slow and tall, quick shit
ah, forgot about it donny, coco my jumper suit, one more move to make
I think its something new, sausage and meatballs for all, get the catalog
black market, black suits and black roses
black bandana tied around my face folded

shadows, hallucinating battles (x4)

black moses, part oceans, hold your nose with a clothes pin
roam alone like a roman, adult swim, sulfur king
I wont pretend, no posing
I'm mellowed out, opiate motioning to the audience when I'm on the podium
potent and dope when flowing, kosher rolling and over
holding a cup of folgers, __ my boner, you don't notice
no bologna or salami, poke your eyes out with chopsticks
head spinning like the exorcist, vomiting, nausea, auswitch
that wasn't a dis, I seen the museum of tolerance
please save the male from anti-semitist, I take offence
listen to the sole control, I had attention
now soldiers getting down like gun slingers, fingers going for their holsters
western eyes ducking for cover, cowboys on a motorola
jumping off the sofa, I knocked over my club soda, I'm playing
just really anxious, slowly losing my patience
got custy's lined up, they hate it when they've been waiting

shadows, hallucinating battles (x4)</pre>
