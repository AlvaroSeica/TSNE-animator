Verse 1
(Wise Intelligent)
Time to get funky-new-radical
Oh you can-say-that-again
Give Universal greetings
Then I slide into this
Some don't understand
Some say they fail to comprehend
Yet some of us can't keep up
Cause I rhyme different
P-R-T
Poor Righteous Teachers
Often greet you with a greeting

(Culture Freedom)
Knowledge, Knowledge

(Wise Intelligent)
That a piece of you're  
Pretty hole in the head
Well it's violent time of rhyming
Take the place
Face the facts
Full time teachers take the front
Substitute teachers play the back
Just for the year fifteen thousand seven, seven
Heard one fool say its "91"
See they don't know what time it is
This still based on mathematics
Blacks still that of Asiatic
Rock the jury
Crack the static
And send your soul in a spin
They try to put lyrics on my time
I rock the rhyme  
That heals the blind
Sure, Ten minutes left
Well I
(Culture Freedom)
KICK THE WHOLE NIIINE!

Verse 3
(Wise Intelligent)
Time to kick
Something a little lower
For savages  
Cause savages are always questioning
The word of the god
Some of them profile me
Some of them knowledge me
Some of them probably
See that I'm highly developed
In the eyes
Of the wise
Eyes on the prize
As the prize gets
Biz		
Busy as the blind, deaf
And dizzy goes nuts
See some still fail to comprehend
I often bend the rules a bit
Cause I'm Wise Intelligent
??????To make the A Plus
Now what am I going to tell them?
When they say that my words are "not all that"
Can't test me youth  
Cause we're known to lick a shot off
Now what am I going to tell them?
When they ask me  
"Who's the Don?"
Well when I was a youth
They often called me Karaka
Spark a microphone  
In the zone or the sea
A power huh  
That's a cipher
See I likes to tamper witcha'
Focus on the teacher
As the teacher
Tend to meet cha'
Halfway

(Culture Freedom)
HIT ME!

(Wise Intelligent)
In a minute I'm' hit cha'
Picture I the teacher  
Going out  
Like the sissy, or the punk  
Or the wimp, or the faggot or the chump.
Some know and understand  
The teachers into style and fashion
Fashion

Hip Hop Lyric
Posse friends what?
Well I suggest we giddy-up
Cause whenever the the teachers takes time to forget some

Come blind, deaf and dumb
Speaking on God's ability
With rhyming the capacity
PRT be asking me

(Culture Freedom)
"Wise ya gonna teach them?"

(Wise Intelligent)
This is what I mean I'm no typical type of teacher

The weakened never see me  
Like I see me in the mirror
So I'm taking care of snakes
And all the savages they come with
On with  
Or just to grab a hold or
Reach into the crescent of your soul
Draw you out then
In still you as your brain drops
Some say it's a slow flow
Still I can keep it ice cold
In still you  
As you inhale it fluffy as if its snow
Yo!
What be this?
I guess I'll tell you since you're asking
Some know I and the teachers into style and fashion
Some state that we okay and
