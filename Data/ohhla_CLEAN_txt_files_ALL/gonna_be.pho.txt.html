[Chorus: Phonte]
And I can tell by the look in your eyes
it's gonna be a beautiful night
I said, it's gonna be a beautiful night
baby doll, baby doll
And I can tell by the way that you're looking at me
it's gonna be a beautiful night
I said, it's gonna be a beautiful night
baby doll, baby doll

[Phonte]
All of my life I've waited for
a love to call my own
Can't explain how it feels, but I like it
I like it, yes I do
Of all the places in the world
that I could call my home
There's nowhere else I would be but beside you
just lying with you

[Chorus: Phonte]

[Carlitta Durand]
I used to be a lonely girl
until I found you
And then you became my world
Always think of you
Oh, I'm so excited
I don't want to fight it, no
Just take me in your arms, tonight

[Chorus: Carlitta Durand]

[Phonte]
My friends, your friends, always got their eye on me
Always tryna spy on me, outlook narrow
They like crabs in a barrel, or like ants in a colony
They front, but I'm thinking lakefront property
so that we can properly, get a slice of life
I'll be there with you, share with you
Make sure you got a piece of mind to recline from the fighting and the arguing
Teetering and tottering, just waiting for the fall
Spend all night waiting for your call
Would have called first but I ain't want you to think a nigga soft
Fuck it, I guess you've proved me wrong
I guess you know the reason why I put you in this song
Because you are my melody, I mean, my inner song
A sun ray of light that lets me know the winter's gone
Ain't no anger when I'm tangled in your hair girl
Skip the bojangling, just be my Lena Horne
It's so good to have you back where you belong
right here in my arms, you know what I'm saying?</pre>
