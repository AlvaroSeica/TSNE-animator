[Chorus: Kryme Life]
You niggas got nothing on me
Who fooled you, ya'll ain't got nothing on me
Wit these new rules, I'm back, homeboy, remember me?
I'm old school, these niggas got nothing on me

[Kryme Life]
Know my flows on some iller shit, New York gorilla
For the skrilla get ya villa hit, send hawks to get you
Get boxed out on the floor, when them boys pick you
Running routes, in and out, straight fundamentals
Run them boys harder than Coach Carter, my mental
Stay sharp, move wit a braveheart a chisel
For shizzle, wherever I go, it's off the hizzle
Let the flame go, destined to blow, I'm on my grizzle
Keep stacks under my mats, I got pillows
These boys keep coming wit shorts, like Willow
Hope they armored up like a 'dillo
I hope out of armored trucks blowing cigarillos
Kryme Life, T.M.F., goodfellas, nigga, I rhyme right
And I ain't in it only for a piece of the lime light
I hope you cowards getting your lines tight, I hang you
Hands out, reaching for my mic, I bang you
Stand out, where streets, cyphers or the corners
Or a sold out performance, the love is enormous
Insane, ten million fan campaign
T.M.F., these niggas can't stand that rain
They getting wet, steel touching ya, under ya umbrellas
Try keepin' us in the dark and undercovers
The truth is unconvered, me and my two brothers
Like gravy over my rice, we got the streets smothered
Labels gave me a price, threw me a few numbers
Been grinding all winter, watch how we do summer
We coming

[Chorus 2X]

[Kryme Life]
These niggas gonna make me, take it off safety
Ain't nobody safe, me? Nigga I don't wave fee
Let it go, click bang, there it go, click bang
T.M.F., man, show niggas ain't shit change
Same O.G., I'm genuine, fake niggas backstabbers
Ain't no friend of mine, cutthroats
Turncoats, I can see it in ya eyes
Pose like you love me, but you don't wanna see me cross the finish line
Hug me, the back of ya mind, you wanna slug me
Reminisce of the days, when it was all lovely
We ain't have a care in the world, just getting money
And we ain't went bite for bite cuz we was hungry
Life took niggas different ways, it's getting ugly
Yes back then was back in the days, it's real funny
Cuz, to a lotta niggas them visions is getting fuzzy
Better, tune in ya antennas, I need some damn answers
When you step, step correct, show some damn manners
I stand for this F, it's my star spangled banner
It's official, I'mma handle my handle
Looking handsome, just for the hood, here go an anthem, come on

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
