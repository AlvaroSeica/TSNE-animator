[KRS-One]
Yeah, Kool Herc!
Kool Herc, this goes out to you
KRS-One, word up, look

Temple of Hip-Hop, non-stop, we rockin you
This is what them b-boys be poppin and lockin to
Head moves, windmills, and yes uprockin to
From Mr. Wiggles, Boogaloo Shrimp, and Shabba Doo
Uh-oh, time for the truth to start boppin through
Stompin through, with somethin new man, we shockin you
This is what hip-hop'll do, perform the impossible
Knowledge Reigns Supreme Over Nearly Everybody OOOH
I'm philosophical, logical, very topical
These rappers man startin to look comical
But I'ma do what I'ma do and never follow
I'ma do, Amadou, even if it leads to Diallo
Victory over the streets that's our motto
Some gotta work for it, others hit the lotto
But big up Luna, Empire, Beedo and Gato
Watch how I spit fire, it's been a long time yo
But really it's a short time, cause I'm already in 2020
Me and Herc yellin MAKE MONEY MONEY MONEY
Hear me sonny while it's sunny release your rhyme
Get your money, ain't nuttin funny, but get peace of mind</pre>
