Song:   First Class
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
Fell asleep in first class
Hoes callin' my phone but fuck it
I get to 'em when I land
And I ain't tryna land cause time is money
So while you worry bout the hoes, I kill shows
and bag more clothes
It's Polo: check
These Jordan 4?s: check
These women know, What I'm on
(what I'm on)

[Wale - Verse 1]
Look, doing life from the 36th floor
Tryna renovate the game, I ain't happy with the score
Hol' up
Insubordinate for good reason
As I coordinate the perfect feature
Uhh, a working genius, a work of art
That's how I see it
Cause I can bring you to your dreams like Salvia
Holiday season, Obama's good neighbour
I ain't talkin to neither but got comma's in my statement
My bitches fuck me good
In the morning make me bacon
And even when I make 'em, mad still make em naked
And I don't take no dames out
I just spit my game out
She don't give her nigga head cause I fuck all her brains out
Hey, that's cold blooded
Hey, these hoes love it
Roll up was $4, Doja was four hundred
Dolce Gabbana stuntin'
A young nigga love it
Why ya'll be gettin' mad
We only gettin' money

[Chorus]

[Big Sean - Verse 2]
Okay today I was the freshest in my area
Freshest in the neighbourhood
Freshest in America
Fuckin bitches chasing paper
I feel like I'm alterior
Boi, I'm historical
I cause the hysteria
Ok, whats a better accessory?
My all gold Rolly or the bitch that's standing next to me
Or the one in front of me
Or the chick leaving
Lightin' reef up like it's the holiday season
Woah there, woah there, these niggaz can't fuck with me
They too little
I'm animal you can't talk to me
Unless you are Dr Dolittle
Welcome, we-welcome to the GOOD life
Heard you had a bad day, well lets make it a good night
But they say we ain't BIG
Turn us to a Suge Knight
Lets swim in alcohol and hop up on that red-eye kush flight
And when I'm old, I'll probably die getting some head
I'm just multiplying my money and dividing the legs
B-I, boi, boi...

[Chorus]

[B.o.B - Verse 3]
From my shell toes to my brim brim
I'm an old soul with my pimp limp
I roll up and I sip sip
Whole team full of OG's packing fo-fo's on the hip hip
But we stay cool, we don't miss miss
Through the grapevine yeah they diss diss
When they feel safe on some bitch shit
I'm first class on my trip trip
With two chicks, sadistic
We touch down in Moscow and take flicks like click click
She so hysterical, she say my life ain't regular cause
I be doing rich shit, you know, baller shit, etc

[Chorus]</pre>
