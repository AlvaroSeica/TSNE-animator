[Lil' Rob]
(Verse 1)
They wanna manipulate your mind
But don't try it
Even if I was the devil and wanted to sell your soul, I wouldn't buy it
I choose to stay quiet
They claimin' they're bigger than me
And I wanna be like David and Goliath
Shut their mouth, finally silence
I hold the Corona
I live in La Colona
Ain't got No One To Depend On me, I no tengo nade like I told ya
They follow like a soldier
I'd rather be my own general
What goes up must come down, what goes around comes around like teatherball
I shine like Armor All
Watch they watch their, partners fall
Watch out for the handshake
Just one flat on the ground, (???) I don't wanna pancake
Baby, let me be the clown for the time of your life
And baby let me be
The lowride for the part of your life
Let me be that part of your life
Many guy have come to you
With a line, that wasn't true
Wasn't true
And you
Passed them by
Now you're in, the center ring
And their lies, don't mean a thing
Mean a thing
Why don't you
Let me try

Chorus: Vocal Bizz
Many guys have come to you
With a line that wasn't true
And you passed them by
Now you're in that center ring
And their lies don't mean a thing
Why don't you let
Me try

(Verse 2)
You come
To my town
Like once
Every week
And I can't sleep, case anticipation got me up like I was blinkin'
Every time you look at me, it seems like you got control of my breathin'
Could it be that you want me, or could it be that you're teasin'
or could it be that I'm dreamin'
Just my imagination
Running away with me
Would it be too much to ask, see, baby, you can stay with me, lay with me
Play with me, and maybe
To spend the day with me
Cause baby
You got this little boy actin' crazily
Now I don't wear a diamond ring
I don't even know what song to sing
But I do know one thing
All the happiness I can bring
I'm your puppet
But please don't take advantage of the string
Cause I cut you loose, once I feel the tangling
and I'll have to find myself a brand new thing
So tell me what you think, between love and hate
there's a line that's thin
So don't leave me in the dark
Don't leave me on the outside looking in
Many guys, have come to you
With a line, that wasn't true
But baby, I'm for real
So tell me how you feel

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 3)
I take it you've been hurt before
Well, I was just thinking
Is it possible in this evil world
to find a little faithfulness in just one girl
It's like finding a needle in a haystack
See, I understand that people make mistakes
But everyone's always out for the payback
They wanna play "take-back"
I know where you're comin' from
You're just lookin' out for number one
I can understand that you didn't want me
But then again, you already got me
Caught up
Under your spell
And love, I already fell
I wanna take you home, Black Magic Woman, I can't leave you alone
I'll never hear the bells
If you leave me (If you leave me...)
And I don't know what I'd do if you deceive me (Deceive me...)
Probably break down, in a lonely stage
And go through a lonely rage
How come nobody told me this, about the loneliest loneliness
Every smilin' face
Ain't a happy one
And without you girl, a happy man
I just can't be one
Many guys, have come to you
With a line, that wasn't true
And you
Passed them by, now
Let me try

Repeat Chorus Twice</pre>
