[Intro: Scarface]
I sit alone in my four cornered room eatin' the wind dinner
 
[DJ Ready Red] 
Ha ha, chill out man
We're doin' the St. Ides Commercial
 
[Scarface] 
Word?
 
[DJ Ready Red] 
Yeah, St. Ides, check it out
 
[Scarface] 
Pick up a brew, read the sticker
And make sure it says St. Ides Malt Liquor
Cause if it don't
You ain't gettin' what you're payin' for 
St. Ides is the team I'm playin' for
But remember there's limit thru
Don't get too full or sure you'll be finished dude
 
[Willie D] 
Scarface, you can say that boy
Cause I'm drinkin' the St. Ides and Willie D is gettin' bull
Of the bear, lets empty the place
Why is that?
Cause I like that smooth taste
St. Ides the Don
When it comes to fun it's number one
Like yo, get you some
 
[Bushwick Bill]
I got mine, watch me rushin'
St. Ides brew, the crooked I gets me bustin'
Four-Double-O-Z and I'm straight
Cause that's all Bushwick get tolerate
St. Ides always run up on you
If you're drinkin' somethin' else 
Your mind is playin' tricks on you</pre>
