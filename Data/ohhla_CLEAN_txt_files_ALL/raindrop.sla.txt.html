[Chorus: Novel]
Teardrops in the pillow of my bed
Still tryin to keep my head up
Know you'd rather see me dead
And the raindrops keep on fallinnnnn
Said it keep on  fallinnnnn
And they keep on  fallinnnnn
Said they keep on  fallinnnnn

[Novel] Slaughterhouse yo

[Royce Da 5'9"]
I'm a product of when a nigga momma gives up
Cryin layin in the trash with the lid shut
Ain't got no family, my mind is tender
My - daddy's invisible, my moms is Brenda
Uhh (uhh) if I survive I'ma grow into what
society considers trash, the rope is to us
That mean I'm hangin myself by livin
The noose is gettin murdered, that or goin to prison
My mind's controlled 'fore I learn mind control
What you call livin life, I call dyin slow (slow)
I'm genetically predisposed
The reaper the only thing that can ease my soul
Freezin cold  feelin like
I was given life, and if I take it at least I chose
I'll probably be in heaven when the pain stops
'Til then all I'm hearin is wind and raindrops

[Chorus] w/ variations + ad libs

[Crooked I]
This just my pain
Dear auntie, I still feel your timeless sorrow
Before you died, it's like your body was mine to borrow
Like I jumped in your physical shell
While you was goin through miserable hell, sayin goodbye to tomorrow
Every day it makes me sad, angry mad
How you was sent to heaven's sacred path
Duct-taped and gagged, plus raped and stabbed
Body draped in blood, what a fate to have!
Such a pitiful end, I'm poppin Ritalin like they Skittles cause when
I sleep, I can feel it again and again and again
And it's difficult, killin is the wickedest biblical sin
I'm talkin 'bout momma's identical twin
I see your face when I look at her
Her reminder of how I been in the cold, since 14 years old
Swear to God, I'll probably be in heaven when the pain stops
'Til then all I'm hearin is wind and raindrops
Rest in peace Cha Cha {*echoes*}

[Chorus] w/ variations + ad libs

[Joe Budden]
Nah, I ain't move bricks on the Peter Pan
No father around to teach me how to be a man
We was too high, didn't know when we would land
(We was) Scrapin coke on the weed so niggaz didn't SEE a plant!
Alcoholic's child, raised off of sugar water (talk to 'em)
Hid it so you would just thought of how good he was brought up
Coulda woulda oughta, one-track mind
They say man of many hats buys a hooker for a quarter (quarter)
And now I'm writin a book and the hood's the author
Called "The Obvious Poker Face - The Look of Torture"
Teach you how to climb your way out that ditch then
Me? All I need is this pen and thick skin
Bein so bright, could mean you lit then (why?)
Cause you start tryin to figure out a figment (ohh!)
I'll probably be in heaven when the pain stops ('til then)
'Til then all I hear is wind and raindrops

[Chorus] w/ variations + ad libs

[Joell Ortiz]
Check (yowwa)
I'm still waitin on my dad to get back
He went to the store in '84 and I ain't seen him after that (what up?)
Another single mom's public assisted, the rent wasn't consistent
So they had us back and forth to court in the months of the blizzard (freezin!)
My sneakers leaned, the rubber was missin
No one-on-ones, they always jumped me, no brothers or sisters
to hold me down, alone with headphones
plugged into a cheap Walkman that ate tapes (what else?)
Gunshots had me sleepwalkin, I hate wakes
A whole lot of cryin, police chalk and that fake tape
Ambulance never on time, they like a day late
My cousin have to vacate, my best friend since age 8! (NO!)
Sometimes I can't hold 'em, I kid you not
Eyes get swollen, holdin on a tissue box, somebody get a mop (damn)
I'll probably be in heaven when the pain stops (word)
'Til then, all I'm hearin is wind and raindrops (raindrops)

[Chorus] w/ variations + ad libs

[Novel]
Yeahhhh, said it keep on fallin
And it keep onnnnn
And the raindrops keep on fallinnnnnnnn
(Ooooooooooohh) Yeah yeah yeah-eahhh</pre>
