[Ghostface Killah]
Yeah
That's right, it's not a Hardy Boy mystery neither
This is real shit
This shit come on right after Hart to Hart y'all
No doubt, seven o'clock Fantasy Island
This episode is "Death to a Brooklyn man"
This is Toney's Angels

Aiyyo, it was three white bitches who worked for Tony Starks
Undercover agents, far beyond NARC's
Amazed by their beauty marks
Wonder Woman bracelets, knee-high boots that was made by Clarks
My dick got hard on how they spoke and shit
Every language was music to the kid as if
I was modern day King Midas
Doreen, Skye and Kelly, Starky's Angels - Shaolin's Finest
Though it happened in the streets of Brooklyn
Plus I played the whip real low cause my face was woofin'
My angels jetted out of Albee Square, gun out, wrap in they hair
Kind of crowded so they clapped in the air
Chase a nigga down block for block, squeezing Glocks
These mammies real anxious to blow off his top
He's a rapist, murderer, convict, burglar
The more they ran the more they skirts got dirtier
Sending shots like check day, FedEx expressway
BOOM BOW BING! You heard the gunplay
"Who shot the duck out the window?" Mr. Lee said
"Three pay now, you fucking weed head!"
We can stop the fire, the suspect, he's dead
Then I pulled up "Come on girls to Club Med"

[MF Doom]
Stay tuned for the conclusion, Three's Company
Family jewels

Two brown sisters assisted the Villain Doom
He woked up, stoked like they was still in his room
Freed his right arm and leg, it was more like a sweep
Released his other leg, arm, head and rose to his feet
Staggering except for the socks and mask, naked
Threw on the boxers, searching for the trio
Checking for the keys, to go, a robbery expected
Yet nothing obvious was missing
Recollected now why Hollywood hotties stepped into Giuseppe Zanotti's
Personal nurses, Chanel purses, CLK shotty
Chasing Patrice with Thai iced teas
She drive wild nice to Veggie Fried Rice Spicy
Told them both "I don't feel so well, my belly"
"Spin me down Melrose, drive me to the telly"
"Y'all go head and get the dutches, be back, copy"
Feeling woozy, no Uzi, who's he see in the lobby? (Peace)
Peace, pizza man (change a hundred) stopped and looked
Nah whoops, left the knot in her pocket book
Wasn't the joox but too careless, fareless
Got to the room and fell flat out on the terrace
The question remained who bound and gagged him
That's when they found the empty pack of black Magnum
Villain's skeeter, gram on the street, fifty G
The part of Mr. Roper was played by Mr. T

[Outro: Ghostface Killah] + (MF Doom)
Fuck Charlie, that's r...
(True story)
Kelly, you gon' give me some pussy
You know what you gonna do
(Janet was dark-skinned)
You too Dorine, your little fat ass can't get away neither and shit
(Kristy was brown-skinned)
Uh huh, that's right yeah I'ma call them Theodore niggas
SWAT team on alert and shit
Uh huh, yeah that's right, Skye you can't hide baby
You got the best head nigga, word up
(The mask was chromed out)
This real Angel shit, y'all my bitches
Toney Bosley in this bitch, nigga
Word up, gimme back my boots
THEODORE!! </pre>
