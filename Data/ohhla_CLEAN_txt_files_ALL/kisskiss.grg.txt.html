"Kiss me you fool!"

[Greg Nice]
Uh-huh, I see ya
Kiss {*4X*} kiss you there
Kiss {*4X*} kiss you there
Kiss {*2X*} kiss you there
Kiss {*4X*} kiss you there
Kiss {*2X*} kiss you there

Kiss {*4X*} kiss you there
Kiss {*2X*} kiss you there
Kiss {*4X*} kiss you there
Kiss {*2X*} kiss you there
Kiss {*4X*} kiss you there

Girl you totally awesome
Must be married time to divorce him
I want to hug and squeeze
and kiss on you like Richard Dawson
Damn you look so sweet
Make me yell out trick or treat
I got hunger pains
Man it's time for me to eat

[Chorus]
(Don't kiss me here) I'll kiss you there
(Don't kiss me there) I'll kiss you there
(You kiss me here) and I'll kiss you there
I'll kiss you any and everywhere
I'll kiss you even way down there {*3X*}
I'll kiss you any and everywhere

[Greg Nice]
Be up all inside her puddin
I remember I said I wouldn't
But she's smokin hot to death
Lookin just like Meagan Good and
Extra sweet, lick or eat
No matter it's gon' be a treat
Went to sleep, had a dream
Thought I ate some Krispy Kreme

[Chorus]
(Don't kiss me here) I'll kiss you there
(You kiss me there) I'll kiss you there
(Don't kiss me here) and I'll kiss you there
(Don't kiss me here) I'll kiss you there
(Don't kiss me there) I'll kiss you there
(Don't kiss me here) I'll kiss you there
(Don't kiss me there) I'll kiss you there
(Don't kiss me there) I'll kiss you here
(Don't kiss me there) I'll kiss you there
I'll kiss you any and everywhere
I'll kiss you even way down there {*2X*}

[Greg Nice]
Yo I ain't afraid of no ghosts
I'll kiss it but I'll lick the most
Yo I don't brag I don't boast
When I kiss it I'll bring the climax close
Sweet and soft like a peach
I seen a whole lot of it on the beach
It ain't a spot on your body my neck won't stretch to
It ain't a spot my lips won't reach, kiss me

[Chorus]
(Don't kiss me here) I'll kiss you there
(You kiss me there) I'll kiss you there
(Don't kiss me here) I'll kiss you there
(Don't kiss me here) I'll kiss you there
(Don't kiss me there) I'll kiss you there
I'll kiss you any and everywhere
I'll kiss you even way down there {*2X*}

[Interlude]
Kiss {*4X*} kiss you there
Kiss {*4X*} kiss you there
Kiss {*2X*} kiss you there
Kiss {*4X*} kiss you there
Kiss {*2X*} kiss you there
Kiss {*4X*} kiss you there
Kiss {*2X*} kiss you there
Kiss {*4X*} kiss you there

[Greg Nice]
Yo~! I heard yogurt's good for the health
Rather have ice cream fo' myself
so I can put sprinkles and whip cream on it
Caramel, fudge, and cherry doggone it

Kiss {*4X*} kiss you there
Kiss {*4X*} kiss you there
Kiss {*2X*} kiss you there
Kiss {*4X*} kiss you there

[Chorus]
(Don't kiss me here) I'll kiss you there
(You kiss me there) I'll kiss you there
(Don't kiss me here) I'll kiss you there
(Don't kiss me here) I'll kiss you there
(Don't kiss me there) I'll kiss you there
(Don't kiss me here) I'll kiss you there
(Don't kiss me there) I'll kiss you there
(Don't kiss me there) I'll kiss you here

Don't kiss me there, I'll kiss you there
You can kiss me here, I'll kiss you there {*2X*}
I'll kiss you any and everywhere
I'll kiss you even way down there {*2X*}
Kiss you even way down there
I'll kiss you any and everywhere {*echoes*}</pre>
