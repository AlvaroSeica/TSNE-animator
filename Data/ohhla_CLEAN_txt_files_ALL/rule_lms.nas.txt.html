[Nas]
Yeah
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Nas...uh
Yo, yo
Life...
They wonder, can they take me under?
Naw, never that
Naw, yo, yo

I come from the hells and tentative buildings, unlimited killings
Ministers marked for death
Better known as the projects, where junkies and rock heads dwell
Though I owe to it my success
When survival of the fittest every day as a child
I would think I'm a part of USA and be proud
Confronted with racism, started to feel foreign
Like, the darker you are, the realer your problems
I reached for the stars but I just kept slipping
On this life mission, never know what's next
Ancient kings from Egypt up to Julius Caesar
Had a piece of the globe, every continent
Yo there's Asia, Africa, Europe, France, Japan
Pakistan, America, Afghanistan
Yo there's Protestants, Jews, Blacks, Arabics
Call a truce, world peace, stop acting like savages
No war, we should take time and think
The bombs and tanks make mankind extinct
But since the beginning of time it's been men with arms fighting
Lost lives in the Towers and Pentagon
Why then, must it go on?
We must stop the killing
Tell me why we die; we're all God's children

[Chorus: Amerie]
All this hate can't last forever
(Uh...C'mon)
Its time that we stand together
(Yeah....For the world)
Everybody wants to rule the world
(What, What, What, What, What, C'mon)
World....Peace
World....Peace
World....Peace
World

[Nas]
Yo there's brothers on the block posted up like they own it
That's their corner, from New York to California
Got blocks locked down
Like dog, you safe whenever you with me
See, this is my town
So the youngsters, pros, and ghettos goes to prison
At a early age, already know what's against them
So in order for him to survive one day
He must open up his eyes to the setbacks and rascals
Cause everybody wants a shot in this land of opportunity
Look at what this country's got
There shouldn't be nobody homeless
How can the President fix other problems when he isn't fixed home yet
The earth wasn't made for one man to rule alone
To all colors and creeds is to whom it belongs
I want land, mansions, banks and gold
To diamonds in Africa, oil in my control
The world's natural resources own its residuals
But then comes foes, I have to guard it with missiles
And I become the most wanted
But is it worth hearing' a million people's problems and followed by secret service
I guess, attempts at my life with loaded barrels
Should we roll with Colin Powell, or just throw in the towel, yo

[Chorus]

[Nas]
You know that's my style, to hit you at the right time
No other compares to what Nas write down
Tell you my dreams, show you my pain is yours
You could get what you love, be a chain to cause
You're alive right now
There's so many that's dead or locked up inside the beast
I'm a holler it now
It's whatever man think will manifest to the real
The plan is to wake up 'cause time reveals
All this hate can't forever last
All my ghetto heroes in heaven it's like you right here and never passed
You just transcend, I know I'm gonna see you again
Hoping' I'll reach the world's ears and win
Ain't nothing without struggle, listen up, it's critical
We used to fear arms, now the weapons are chemical
In hip-hop the weapons are lyrical
To be the best you challenge the best, and the blessing is spiritual
Top of the world for the kid none less
Popping' any rapper's head off his shoulders, no contest
I know the most high hear me, so fly you can't hear me
You scared of a mirror
My theory is that knowledge is power
To every projects and every street corner
We gotta get ours, now!

[Chorus]</pre>
