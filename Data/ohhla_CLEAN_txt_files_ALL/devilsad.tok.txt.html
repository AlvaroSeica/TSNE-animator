Chorus

How do I explain
What is it I can say
That'll help me make it through the day
How do I explain
What is it I can say
That'll help me change my evil ways
How do I explain
What is it I can say
That'll help me take off all these chains
Pleasure with the pain
How do I explain

Chorus

I'm a Devil's Advocate...
Miss Brown Skin
Light brown skin
Dark brown skin
We can link around 10
I said, I ain't got no lady
You ain'r got no man
Tell me what's the deal
What's the plan
You want to talk
Want to touch
Want to make love
Want to have sex
Want to fuck?
You want all of the above
But you want it with somebody
You can trust
Might as well face it
I'm addicted to love
Or is it lust
Trying to keep you in my grasp
In my clutch
When we split like a dutch afterwards
I wondered if we moved in a rush
Not waiting for the next bus
What they say,
Every 15 here comes another one
'bout to get in something that's troublesome
is a relationship possible
is it realistic or an obstacle
not for you
I'm on the phone
Said I need some time alone
When you gone
Wish I had you in my home
Said you've got a Jonz in your bones
Play D'angelo
Angie Stone told me
Come and get it while its warm
I called you back and said come on
Lets meet halfway
We can burn it til
We filling up the ashtray
And I've never been the one for betrayl
I've just got to find a way to say no
Devil's Advocate

Chorus

How do I explain
What is it I can say
That'll help me make it through the day
How do I explain
What is it I can say
That'll help me change my evil ways
How do I explain
What is it I can say
That'll help me take off all these chains
Pleasure with the pain
How do I explain

Chorus

Sins of the father
Cast down upon the son
As the sun sits overcast
Beaming down upon us
Hand inside the gauntlet
With a hair trigger
Father figure
Views The Bible Channel
As he sips upon his liquor
Son watches father
Watching channel
As the hammer hits the anvil
And its thinning out the blade
I recollect the times I could of died
By suicide but stayed alive
Before I hit the 7th grade
I met a friend
Who jumped over the ledge
But someone grabbed her leg
Before the halo or the flames came overhead
I understood that all her tears were shed
And realized that I lived in denial
Later restless in my bed
Know the secrets some should never know
Deep inside I hold
Wishing I was never ever told
Praised by others
Telling me I'm bold
But I often wished my ears were shut
Mouth were taped
And eyes were closed
So

Chorus

How do I explain
What is it I can say
That'll help me make it through the day
How do I explain
What is it I can say
That'll help me change my evil ways
How do I explain
What is it I can say
That'll help me take off all these chains
Pleasure with the pain
How do I explain

Chorus

The high rise is bigger
Than the skyscrapers in the distance
Living in a complex
Can be some complex
Section 8 'til we get it straight
I said, we gon make it big
Get up out here any day
(Repeat)

Chorus

How do I explain
What is it I can say
That'll help me make it through the day
How do I explain
What is it I can say
That'll help me change my evil ways
How do I explain
What is it I can say
That'll help me take off all these chains
Pleasure with the pain
How do I explain
