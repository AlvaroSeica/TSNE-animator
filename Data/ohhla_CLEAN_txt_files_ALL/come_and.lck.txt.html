[Lady Luck]
Yo!
Yo, yo, yo, come on
Yo, yo, yo, come on
Yo, yo, yo, yo!

[Verse 1: Lady Luck]
Yo, yo, yo
You could get rugged, rough, hard like luck
Bring your best rhymes and you niggas still suck
I'm slumped in a truck, with the pump tucked
Come to bend some dough? Never give em love
Your money like old men, can't get it up
I'm spittin up, sick of stuff, middle fingers up
Luck, never give y'all respect
Like no hot card check pounds with the left (What up, my)
If you get offended, I'm talkin to you
Come get it, and there'll be a coffin for you
You done did it, you messin with Luck, you pressin your luck
Got locked in jewels and I ain't givin em up

[Chorus: Redman]
(Come get it) Y'all niggas wanna fuck wit Jers'
(Come get it) Tha Bricks don't fuck wit her
(Come get it) I represent Jers' till I die
Smoke on the la la la, la, la, la
[Lady Luck] (Redman)
(Come get it) Y'all niggas don't want it wit Jers'
(Come get it) Luck don't come wit hers
(Come get It) I represent Jers' till I die
smoke on the la la la, la, la, la

[Verse 2: Redman]
Yo, yo yo, Funk Doc
Smack y'all niggas, jack y'all niggas
Have ya thug as thug come get it back for y'all niggas
Laugh at y'all niggas, throw caps at y'all niggas
Stick NBA for the basketball figgas
Gigolow, live with two hoes, John Ritter
Arm litter (bling!), microphone tormenter
I'm hungry as FUCK and I came to eat
If you came to shoot Doc, can you aim at least?
Bricks, sucker MCs that stay hookin up
You bougie hoes like, That's What I'm Looking For
Do, your moms think I'm a hell of a guy
Pussy, you don't get it like American Pie
I scar deep wounds, bubble teaspoons
Powder is the ?, yeah, bottle is the mind
When I spit, y'all become fiends to me
Crack costs MONEY, but the fee is free

[Chorus]

[Lady Luck](Redman)
(Aiyyo, low
Do you really know what pressure is?)
Nigga I apply it
The one scannin TVs in the Rodney King riot
Guns, all solids; whips, no milage
At the bar, three iced teas, Long Island
I stay stylin', boo stay fair with weed
In the V lane, 3 switchin' up with speed
I'ma be obnoxious until I can't, breathe
And until, then, y'all can't, win
Luck's 12 on a scale from 1 to 10
And blew a spiral hydro and lots of gin
Nigga back up! Damn, I need oxygen
Surrounded by lots of men that'll rock ya chin
And pop ya lids, handle like Iverson
The Mulberry, flows extraordinary
How 'bout the go Chevy a hole in the 4 steady
Been wantin' war let me know when y'alls ready

[Chorus]</pre>
