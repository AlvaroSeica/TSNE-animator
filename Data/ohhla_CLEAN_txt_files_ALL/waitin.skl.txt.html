(*Come on scratched several times*) 

(Skee-Lo)
Jump, jump geronimo
Buckle up and here we go 
I'm here to entertain and introduce my name 
I'm Skee to the Lo and I'm here to do a show
And if you forgot or do not then act like you know
If you could see this wannabe I'm makin sure you're readin me 
Know of me knew of me let me hear your demo
I rushed it rushed it to the toilet and I flushed it 
Cause cuss words are hush words so sshh I'm disgusted 
Just sit back baby listen to your radio
Baffled as a bat sayin who is that?
It's the mad, mad ones from Mad Tracks
Makin mad beats for you punks to get mad at
So, if you really want to know to who's beat am I rhymin
Really doesn't matter cause I'ma make ya scatter
I might get through but if you wanna start 
3 'o' clock we can take it to the park
I'll be waitin for ya

(Chorus)
(*Come on scratched several times*)
Not unless I say I'll be waitin 
Not unless I say I'll be waitin

(Skee-Lo)
Snap, crackle, pop
Oh wow look at me now
Holy cow watch me blew up blow up
Make ya throw up
I got mad fills to make mad bills 
If I want a buffalo ruffa-so big
About my chis-nip skills I get ill to make a mill
From the basement of my cris-nip 
Wreck shop and get biz with ruff kids
Like Jodeci makin sure you notice me
Or was we emcees but wanted all our enemies to stop
And just run, run from-a cause I'm the done, done-a 
I'm rappin you don't want to hear that so
The number 1 I'm 2, I'm 3, yo follow me
Yo nuff respect due to the one who calls me
Not Jamaican a Rastarfarian
I play Atari and sometimes Nintendo 
Relieve is from the Endo leave  
You got beef and loose teeth
But you really wanna start we can take it to the park
I'll be waitin for ya 

(Chorus)
(*Come on scratched several times*)
Wait, waitin in the park
Waitin for ya
Waitin in the park
Waitin for ya
Waitin in the park
Waitin for ya
Waitin in the park
Waitin for 
Not unless I say I'll be waitin 
Not unless I say I'll be waitin

(Skee-Lo)
Red Rover, Red Rover
Now watch me come on over 
You know I'll cross the sea as if my name was Noah
Watch out cause I know ya 
Clear across the continent
Cause you know Apacalla like the lickin monument 
(So heeey!) I'm famous but never call me nameless 
I don't like cookies, never been a rookie
Played hooky so whoopee 
Arrest me protest me do what you wanna
But you no your gonna have to give me props, give me props
I zip like lock grab my microphone and rock bad news on the block 
Did you forget forgot sweat me not
Well listen to the sounds of a rapper go pop
The weasel like diesel I fills up your truck 
?I lock ya to the talent? so that I make the bucks
I wreck shops for hip-hop and even recruits 
Give me a beat so I can flow and I'm gonna wreck that too
Cause I'll be waitin for ya

(Chorus)
(*Come on scratched several times*)
Wait, waitin in the park
Waitin for ya
Waitin in the park
Waitin for ya (not unless I say)
Waitin in the park 
Waitin for ya (not unless I say)
Waitin in the park
Waitin for 
Ya, in the park
Waitin for ya
In the park
Waitin for ya
In the park
Waitin for ya
In the park
Waitin for ya
In the park
Waitin for ya</pre>
