The story is touching like Shakespeare wrote it
Potent enough to propel a helicopter off and coast it
It opens with a hood setting, hood life, hood dreams
CREAM is the motto, let's follow throughout these city streets
Had an influence on most, the kind, have blind leading the blind
Refined light years ahead of his time
Pedal drugs above the street level's thugs and hustlers
Fiends issuing checks, hoes issuing sex
Probably too much to muster, plunder until nothing's left
No honor amongst thieves, believe hat sudden death
Never enter this brain, doing his thing, pushing 'caine and all
Where they hate it if you getting paid
And they not, now they plot to discontinue his reign
A king to a slave in just a matter of days
There's million ways to die, his decision on the clock
But most niggas I know will simply die for their block
What a way to go, no justice expect this guilt I'm stuck with it
Laid it for all you haters, my guns that's rapid firing
The streets silenced them, I could of saw us all retiring
Believe in karma, 'cause I saw the drama climbing
Kept an eye on 'em, turn next minute they're all trying 'em
This ain't the burbs, no police sirens, just violence
And tragic endings, casualties pending and soul's risen
I burn immune to the street living, I'm no victim

[Chorus: Salute]
Yo, these streets ain't paved gold
Walk with a limp, pair of dice and kangols
From pleading to robbing, from greens we're goblins
Same greeds and rhyming, you feel me?
Life is like 'deal me in or do me in
Same grave I live in, still the same grave they've threw me in

[Bronze Nazareth]
Yo, shit was poetic like Shakespeare's words
Chilling enough to freeze the blood on Illinois curb
It started with a tenement setting, the plot would thicken
The root of all evil, only grows from his wishes
Started catching victim after victim by the ATM on Whitmin
His pops was a one hit wonder hitman
Underneath the river they've shipped him
And found an armed suit forever to fit him
He was a leader, but eager didn't follow patterns like receivers
Trash blowing through alley's
See the deacons standing up in front of theatres
His hoes following him, plotting to swallow out the pocket column
Brown Rottweiler to chihauhua in just a few hours
Premeditating his last possible oxygen swallow
Gasoline, moccasin, kerosene, towel
Twenty two slug, broke his skull into particles
Told his brother be strong, to calm a storm a little
Exit early, stage left, the clue's the puzzle
Been immune to the church morgue, it's muffle</pre>
