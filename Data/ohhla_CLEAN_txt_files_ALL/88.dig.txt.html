[Intro]
You know they gon' say
What Diggy know bout 88?
Well I know this much
They made a lotta money back then
And that's what mine lookin' like

[Diggy Simmons]
Aye lil, it's Diggy
Got the key to the city
Check my family tree
You know uncle taught Diddy
Who turned around and taught Biggie
And Biggie taught Jigga
So you can just imagine what he teaching me
My top down in the winter
My doors up in the summer
I pulled up to the light
And I drove off with her number

88 is the number!
Like Michael Irvin but younger
Ain't no preserving my hunger
Now they're like "Where did he come from?"

Well I got 2 years in
And a couple of months
Yeah, the road was Bobby Brown
It had a couple of bumps
They be showing me love
Minus a couple of chumps

In my best Chris Tucker voice, "Is this what you want?! "

[Chorus]
No need to front
Homie pardon my back
I'm gettin it crazy
How retarded is that?
I'm playin' my cards
Got a fist fulla ace's
And these lil faces
I'm spending you prolly could trace it

To 88
88 [x15]
(And I'm still spending money from 88)

[Diggy Simmons]
I hear the hate
I don't sweat it
Cause I'm getting that fetti' (I said it)
I see a lot of mad rappers
Derric D-Dot Angelettie
Compliments to the chef
Ya boy out here eatin great
Homie you ain't no umpire
Why you watchin my plate?
While you watchin my pockets, Jordan 3?s in my closet
I get it all sent to me
So, I don't need to go to shoppin
I ain't braggin, I'm swaggin
My fly ladies what's happening?

Shout to Nicki
I'm an Aries and we go good with Sag's
Mhmmm
Hope that made you smirk
I'm a flirt like Kirk
With Dirty Money God made dirt and (Uh) dirt don't hurt
This for my, That's gettin it every month on the first

[Chorus]
No need to front
Homie pardon my back
I'm gettin it crazy
How retarded is that?
I'm playin' my cards
Got a fist fulla ace's
And these lil faces
I'm spending you prolly could trace it

To 88
88 [x15]
(And I'm still spending money from 88!)

[Jadakiss]
Yo, That's what my family was rockin'
I just sat back and watched em
I was only 13 So I ain't know nothin bout coppin'
I just knew that they had it
And if I asked then I got it
It all started from trees
Then it turned to narcotics
All the whips was exotic
All the chicks was erotic
Money was coming so fast
All you needed was product
And somebody to test it
Find a good place to try it
Never keep nothin' on you
Find a good place to hide it
If I'm in it I own it
Cause if I like it I buy it

Keep the loud in the air
Kinekt like that I'm quiet
How'd you hop in this platinum
And you ain't even near gold
Cause I'm still spendin' money
That's 24 years old!
