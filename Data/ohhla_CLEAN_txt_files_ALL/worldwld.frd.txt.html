Song:   The World Would Keep On
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Bridge: x2]
If I should die today
My soul would blind your way
The world would keep on

[Chorus]
It's so hard to find a way
In this life there's barely faith
And if I should die today
Nothing would change, nothing would change

[Interlude]
It's crazy 'cause life's supposed to be precious
And it's supposed to be a long time
But when death comes, it just occurs
It will be like nothing happened in the hour

[Verse 1]
I'm from the block, baby, put back feel with birth control pills
If government don't put us to work, we gonna kill
They don't care, the buildings they got the cameras on them
My man still in the lobby with two hammers on him
The hood drowns, money's water, get your shoes damp
Everybody who walks with food stamps
Sometimes it hurts the soul
I've seen a nigga come 200 deep
And leave in a hearse alone
New technology, grandma tryina work her phone
Grandpa in the liquor store, it's looking like a nursing home
Elderly everywhere, did we ever care?
They don't got money because they spent forever there
I'm in the front, my sister braiding my hair
I got shooters on every corner, fuck with me if you dare
It's murder every day in case you're unaware
'Cause the people that's representing us was never here

[Bridge: x2]
If I should die today
My soul would blind your way
The world would keep on

[Chorus]
It's so hard to find a way
In this life there's barely faith
And if I should die today
Nothing would change, nothing would change

[Verse 2]
I try to stay fly, joins the concretes
Life's a battle ground, we all on the concrete
Falls and arms reach, we all street
High school, we weren't stupid
And them hoes should be called screech
It's the ghetto, we lost from the get go
Slain just to get love 'cause things we gotta get, though
Like our life in order, like for the wife and daughter
It's all a toss so despite the quality
The other night they shot a cop
So this will probably ignite the slaughter
It's hunting season in the hood, you can't fight the order
We have dreams of college and how with home comings
But can't afford it, how we home running?
I wish that I could break the shackles, attack and how we long something
I put my feelings in my lyrics like the song command
If I was gone I know the world will keep on
So I'm a keep on, keep on

[Bridge: x2]
If I should die today
My soul would blind your way
The world would keep on

[Chorus]
It's so hard to find a way
In this life there's barely faith
And if I should die today
Nothing would change, nothing would change</pre>
