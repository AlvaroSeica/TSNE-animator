[Frank Ocean]
Ohhh, yeah... {*2X*}
I'm runnin from the man
I'm runnin from a flag
I made love to my lady before I packed
I left her while she slept
I put 87 grand, cash, in the glovebox
I left the keys to the car by the bed
Cause I got her

[Chorus]
Ohh! I wish she could be the Bonnie to my Clyde
But I won't risk her life for mine
No oh, not for mine
No Bonnie, no Bonnie, I'm sorry, so sorry

[Frank Ocean]
I'm runnin water through my hands
And flippin pictures in my head of her
I wish I taught the girl how to shoot a gun
so I wouldn't worry as much
Oh, last night
I put 87 grand, cash, in the glovebox
I left the keys to the car by the bed
Cause I got her

[Chorus] - repeat 2X w/ ad libs

[Frank Ocean]
The money should last awhile
But I know without a dime she got me
When the feds come around, she got me
No snitchin allowed from my baby

[Chorus] - repeat 2X w/ ad libs

[Outro]
So sorry, no Bonnie
No Bonnie</pre>
