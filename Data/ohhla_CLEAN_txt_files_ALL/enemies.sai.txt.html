[Saigon]
When I first met you I thought that you and I was friends to the end
People told me men you befriended just went to the pen
But I ain't listen to them
Cause you promised as long as I fuck wit'chu I'd never be in the same position again
Like you said they just jealous cause we gon' get rich and they not
They work a lot, we play the block, still got more than they got
Cousin guzzlin Henny high
People say if I keep fuckin wit'chu I'd subsequently die, end up with 25
They claimin you claim many lives
With semi {?} from guys, innocent ladies, babies of any size
Nah I knew it wasn't the truth, cause they ain't have nothin for proof
They even blame you for dozens of youths in substance abuse
What kinda crap is that? Everybody know that crackers brought crack to a habitat
to attack the Latins and Blacks
Never mind that fact son, and I know it's wrong
You was there when my hopeless mom put me out in the coldest storm
Even though you did introduce me to Smoke and Tron
And totin one, you welcomed Saigon with open arms
That's all I could focus on, the reason I wrote this explosive song
To show even the closest born (look)
Get torn (get torn) you tricked me all along
You had me thinkin you was my friend, you NEVER loved Saigon! (Saigon)

[Chorus 2X: Saigon]
With friends like you who needs enemies?
Brought a nigga bad luck like the Kennedy's
You had a nigga ass up in the penitentiary
With friends like you who needs enemies?

[Saigon]
Not only smokin Newport cigs, guzzlin whole 40's and force wigs
You taught the kid more than any school in New York did
Teachers teachin me social studies (yeah)
But wasn't there for Saigon to cry on, after the wakes of my closest buddies
I was too up, I depicted this picture true love
Was I just a fool or just too young? Or strung on the booze that you brung?
Snatch my soul, put a hole in it
Grab my mind, took control of it
Made my heart as cold as the home of the pose{?} of it
Funny when you wasn't around it wasn't no incidents
Let you tell it all of that was simply coincidence
That's the thesis I doubt - before I met you
I wouldn't have kicked Theresa's eye out or have the police in my house
I wouldn't have needed keys to fly south
Murder rap would never ease from my mouth
I'd probably be at peace with myself
Probably think what you did to me was sweet
Laughin at me like kee-kee-kee for fallin for your trickery in defeat
Don't flatter yourself, it don't take a genius to spell thug
Convince a kid at the mere age of 12 to sell drugs
If you really had G you had them white kids like you had me
It was they great granddaddies that created you badly
They was the ones that flooded you with gats in liquor stores
Macks, pimps with the whores that trade cash in for intercourse
And of course these young niggaz stay suckin you off
But I know the truth, so poof, I'm cuttin you off ("Watch out for your friend")

[Chorus]

[Outro: Saigon]
You did this to me! ("Watch out for your friend")
You did this to me man
You know what? ("Watch out for your friend")
A lot of times we grow up, thinkin the streets is our friends
Y'knahmsayin? ("Watch out for your friend")
Streets ain't your motherfuckin friend young blood
Take it from me man
I been in the street my whole motherfuckin life ("Watch out for your friend")
And I ain't get nothin but pain, death, jail
Fuck in the streets man ("Watch out for your...")</pre>
