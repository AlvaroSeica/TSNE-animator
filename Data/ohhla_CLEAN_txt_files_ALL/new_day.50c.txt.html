[Intro: sampled from "A Bronx Tale"]
"It don't take much strength to pull a trigger
 but try and get up every morning day after day and work for a living.
 Let's see 'em try that.
 Then we'll see who's the real tough guy.
 The working man is the tough guy."

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
Party people say, party people say AYYYY!
It's a new dayyyy, it's a new dayyyy!
World is gettin ready, everybody ready, YEAH!
For a new dayyyy, for a new dayyyy!
Celebrate and say
Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay {*3X*}
Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay, ay-ay-ay-ay-ay

[Dr. Dre]
I woke up this morning thinkin 'bout the old me
When I was feelin like Miller Lite and Olde E
But now I ride on some conscious shit
I'm gettin bread while I toast to my accomplishments
Only one I could have a problem with is myself
That's probably why my only competition is myself
From today to tomorrow the Doc'll just rock to the same drum
Fuck the past, though I ain't forgot where I came from
Uh, I got the club rockin
Uh, I got your girl jockin
Uh, me and Fif' still in this bitch, bitch
We goin the distance wit'chu party people, c'mon

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
Yeah, now you can get your knees on the church floor and pray it get better
Or push the door on the liquor store, see where it gets you
But me I got to be on top
I said me I got to be on top, I got the street on lock
I'm on automatic pilot, ain't nobody stoppin me
Growin up in poverty ain't filled my heart with larceny
Niggaz ride I don't hide, I duck to get 'em off of me
I'm a leader, we're gon' see the natural born boss in me
They from Bel-Air I'm from the bottom, soon as I spot 'em
I get the drop then I got 'em, I cut my piece as I dot 'em
It's dinnertime, when the nine come out, it's off with the chain
Off of the brain, move bang, off with your brain now

[Chorus]

[Alicia Keys]
Clooooocks on the walllll
It's nooooow or never at alllll
I'm gonna give it my alllll, oh-ooh-ohhhhhhhh
Whether I rise or falllll, oh-ooh-ohhhhhhhh

[50 Cent]
True story, I said I'd +Get Rich or Die Tryin'+
I did it, good luck sucka tryin to stop my shine
Nothin matters but the music, music my first love
With paper chasin I'm always comin in first cuz
I'm built for it, see I'm better under pressure
I react like a maniac when I'm comin to getcha
I got to win, Em watchin, Dre watchin, my son watchin
Fuck that, losin ain't an option
I'm sharp, I'm on point, the ink from my ballpoint
Pourin out my pain, I'm back on my A game
I'm focused, for me this is just another victory
Except that I'm stronger than a ox now mentally

[Chorus]</pre>
