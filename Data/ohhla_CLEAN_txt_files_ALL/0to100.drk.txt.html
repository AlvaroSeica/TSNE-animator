Fuck bein' on some chill shit
We go 0 to 100 nigga, real quick
They be on that "rap to pay the bill" shit
And I don't feel that shit, not even a little bit
Oh Lord! Know yourself, know your worth, nigga
My actions been louder than my words, nigga
How you so high, but still so down to Earth, nigga?
If niggas wanna do it, we can do it on they turf, nigga
Oh Lord! I'm the rookie and the vet
Shoutout to the bitches out here holdin' down the set
All up in my phone, lookin' at pictures from the other night
She gon' be upset if she keep scrollin' to the left, dawg
She gon' see some shit that she don't wanna see
She ain't ready for it; if I ain't the greatest then I'm headed for it
Yeah, that mean I'm way up
Yeah, the six ain't friendly but it's where I lay up
... This shit a mu'fuckin' lay up
I been Steph Curry with the shot
Been cookin' with the sauce, chef, curry with the pot, boy
... 360 with the wrist, boy (ay)
Who the fuck them niggas is, boy?
OVO, man we really with the shits, boy
Yeah, really with the shits
I should prol'ly sign to Hit-Boy cause I got all the hits, boy (hehe)
Fuck all that "Drake you gotta chill" shit
I be on my Lil Mouse drill shit
Fuck all that "rap to pay your bill" shit
Yeah, I'm on some "Raptors, pay my bills" shit
All up on TV, I thought it'd make me richer
Wasn't payin' me enough, I needed somethin' quicker
So now I'm all in Niko's basement puttin' work in on the phones
Either that or drive to money mart to make the pickups
Man it's 2008, I'm tryna paint the picture
"Comeback Season" in the works and now I'm thinkin' bigger
I got 40 in the studio, every night, late night
Gotta watch that shit, don't want to make him sicker - that's my nigga!
Oh Lord! Got a whole lot to show for it
I mean we can really get it, we can go for it
I'm just here for the bucks and the billi's, nigga~!
Don't make me kill one of the GOAT's for it
Uhh, I run this shit, they like "Go Forrest
Run Forrest, run Forrest, go Forrest!"
Yeah, I mean you already wrote for us
Damn, nigga, what's one more quote for us?
Oh Lord! Who else soundin' like this?
They ain't make me what I am, they just found me like this
I was ready... fuck that, I've been ready
Since my dad used to tell me he was comin' to the house to get me
... He ain't show up
... Valuable lesson, man I had to grow up
That's why I never ask for help
I'll do it for you niggas and do it for myself

I go 0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, whole squad on that real shit
0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, real fuckin' quick, nigga
0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, whole squad on that real shit
0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, real fuckin' quick, nigga</pre>
