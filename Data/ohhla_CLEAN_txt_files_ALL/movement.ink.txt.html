Song:   The Movement
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I know you can feel the movement, moving
I know you can feel the movement, moving

I know you can feel the movement, moving
It's nothing more than a movie
And this moment feel like 50, nothing but G's all in my unit
We built this from the roots, smell like trees all in my room
Fire cook the kush in the blunt, out the kitchen next to you
The story, the act itself, made way more money with acadel
But I'm doin this cus I dream big
And you already know who the team is
Never thought that we'd make it out
Grew up over where the fiends at
That's that thing that made me a man, swear I just act like a millionaire
If we talkin bout numbers, really me and you don't speak well
Just go ahead wit yo mixtape
I'm killin it with my pre-sell
Hope you getting prepared, everybody here with me gon prevail
Stay servin, it's deeper than you is

I know you can feel the movement, moving
See everybody around us, we built from the ground up, damn
I know you can feel the movement, moving
Top speed, no side bitch, losing's no option
Said I know you can feel the movement

Duckin the rules, high, stuck in the move
Don't look confused, everything coming in 2's
From 3 to 6 in the morning
What is she doin? Really don't care if you don't
Like what I'm on, to hell wit all yo complaints
I'm tryna stay humble and motivate
But let's celebrate, pour me a drink
Everything earned never concerned long as we grind
How do you skate?
All of these tats, all of this gold, stereotypes I'm tryna escape
I can see just why you relatin
But in my mind nobody competin
Leavin behind the rearview chasin
Ridin in my own lane just flexin
More ketchup, it ain't no pressure under pressure
Make sure to get my respect, waitress
Make sure everything is my just wants
These haters in the building keep booing
But ain't nobody gon do shit
We in this here just deeper than usual

I know you can feel the movement, moving
I know you can feel the movement, moving
We ain't tryna hurt nobody
We ain't tryna hurt nobody

I know you can feel the movement, moving
See everybody around us, we built from the ground up, damn
I know you can feel the movement, moving
Top speed, no side bitch, losing's no option
Said I know you can feel the movement

Said I know you can feel the movement
Pull up, truck big as a mover, ain't nowhere to park
Backyard big as an amusement park
Come through lookin like the millionaire march
My bad, I just had to brag one time
Hit em in the head with a brand new style
Closet full but there ain't no ties
Mouth full of gold, got a brand new smile
It ain't nothing new that these groupies been choosin
But we movin, better hold on, don't lose it

I know you can feel the movement, moving
See everybody around us, we built from the ground up, damn
I know you can feel the movement, moving
Top speed, no side bitch, losing's no option
Said I know you can feel the movement</pre>
