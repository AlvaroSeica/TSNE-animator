[Intro: Big Boi] + (Gucci Mane)
Yeah! All the ladies say hoooo
All the hoes say, (Hah, Hah, Hah, It's Gucci)
Here we go A-town! C-post!
Cutmaster Swiff, down your throat
Boy stop!!!! 

[Verse One: Big Boi]
Sir Luscious Left Foot's on fire
Trying to block my shine just ain't gone happen so don't try
Every time I get on this microphone I like to spit
Inking hit up after hit, This penmanship is so legit
I came equipped like a prophylactic, now they riding dicks 
+Lifestyling+ on these suckers out here tryin to buy they bitch
Now they rich try to convince everybody to trick off
But a true boss done paid the cost, she giving away her drawers
Word to the +Brown, James+, she some chicken chowmein
Really mayn you done said the silly things
And the fella Dana Dane, boy, you cuffed and claimed a dame
Hey, my main thang got my last name, got all her, mayn

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
I'm on my grind shawty, don't block my shine shawty
Hold up, hold up guess who just showed up?
Rolled up, rolls cut, drop with the doors up
I'm on my grind shawty, don't block my shine shawty
Wait a minute, wait a minute, chill a little, sit a minute
I can't close my safe no more cause I got too much money in it

[Verse Two: Gucci Mane]
They put Gucci in a cell, did my deal went to jail
I make music, I make movies, I need Tyler Perry's cell
Loud smell coming out the Lamb', fuck it, what the hell
Gucci Mane, so I'm Gucci down, she got on Chanel
In the cut rolling stupid kush like I'm in a rush
In the club with half a pound, 150 blunts
Zone 6 Atlanta, fuck with me the longest
So I shine like it's showtime, all my jewelry on
On the block with the stupid watch, boy you need to stop
When I stop everybody watch, car don't have a top
And stretch cost a stupid check, rolling up the pack
Now I'm gone, I can't even flex, Eastside where you at?

[Chorus]

[Verse Three: Big Boi]
Can't be tripping bout no paper cause the safe is not so safe,
The piggy bank got legs and feet, and can get up and walk away, shawty
With my southern drawl, awkwardly I spray 
Like the backside of a skunk and the stash house with the pump
Pistol whip in my lap at all times in the 'Llac 
From Atlanta to Savannah, can a nigga stop that?
Not when God's got his hands on me only the strong survive
And the weak minded are falling by the wayside
They try But which I overcome and succeed, indeed
But with success comes a great responsibility
We chose to lead not follow, It's a hard pill to swallow
Better get prescriptions filled cause there might not be tomorrow

[Chorus]

[Outro: Big Boi] + (Gucci Mane)
Yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah
A-Town representer (Hold-hold-hold up)
East Point, College Park
Decatur, Yeah!
I got me armor on, sword and shield on deck</pre>
