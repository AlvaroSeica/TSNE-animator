Song:   I Live in a Split Level Head
Typed by: Brian Rancourt

*Two voices in unison, one on each of the stereo channels*

I've lived in apartments, I've lived in a home
I've travelled in trailers when I used to roam
But now in these places you won't catch me dead
'Cause I've happy I live in a split level head

I do what I want to, no worries, no cares
If anyone bugs me, I climb up my stairs
Way up to a level where I feel no threat
'Cause I'm happy I live in a split level head

If you're trying something I couldn't care less
I don't rush for buses, my trains are a mess
There's no one to care for, I don't need a bed
'Cause I'm happy I live in a split level head

I like how I'm living, I'm nobody's slave
My head's above water so don't make a wave
There's no door to lock and no dog to be fed
'Cause I'm happy I live in a split level head

So why should I move when the neighbourhood's right?
No taxes to pay and no landlord to fight
Now I call this living, what's more, like I said
'Cause I'm happy I live in a split level head

Now you keep your ulcers, your ills and what new
You sure couldn't have them and live like I do
You think I have problems but you do instead
'Cause I'm happy I live in a split level head

I live with two people, I like both of them
He likes both of me and I like both of him
They're my alter egos and to them I'm wed
'Cause I'm happy I live in a split level head

There's no simple status in my neighbourhood
It's that kind of thinking that keeps it so good
I don't take the lead when I like to be led
'Cause I'm happy I live in a split level head

So why should I move when the neighbourhood's right?
No taxes to pay and no landlord to fight
Now I call this living, what's more, like I said
'Cause I'm happy I live in a split level head

	I've lived in apartments, I've lived in a home
	I've travelled in trailers when I used to roam
	But now in these places you won't catch me dead
	'Cause I've happy I live in a split level head

Now you keep your ulcers, your ills and what new
You sure couldn't have them and live like I do
You think I have problems but you do instead
'Cause I'm happy I live in a split level head

I don't know what he said, what'd he say?
You know what he said?
