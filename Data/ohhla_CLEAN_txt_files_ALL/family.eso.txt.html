Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Yeah, ooh
You've found me in a good mood, yaa little bastards

My Grandma told me
Do not take shit
From anybody in this motherfucking bitch
See, my Grandma told me
Never never never take no shit
Especially that shark in the dark
'Cause that shark in the dark can suck my..
Watch your mouth!

My Grandma told me
Never ever ever take no shit
And that's probably why my Grandpa hides
Well my Grandmas won
My heart won't quit

My Dad taught me how to handle the riff raff
And Mum bought the pain
First time I did graff
One time for the fam' that you got
Granny got a gun and never ran from the cops
So I stand on this rock with a Zen mentality
And we drift this bitch 'til we bend reality
My blood bangs when I handle the beat
So I don't bark up my family tree

I say what you think
But I'm not a mind reader
I'm good to my girl
But I wear a wife-beater
Happy as fuck when I rap with my cause
If you're battling him
Then you're battling us

A world full of wolves
Who's the leader of the pack?
When they teach you how to act
Try to keep you in a trap
Conditioned 'til you're blue in the face
So take it from rage
I won't do what they say!

Because my Grandma told me
Never never ever take no shit
Especially that shark in the dark
'Cause that shark in the dark can suck my..
Watch your mouth!

My Grandma told me
Never never ever ever take no shit
And that's probably why my Grandpa hides
Well, my Grandmas won
My heart won't quit

Just bob, like you're mad OMarley
And I've finally got a job to get my Dad that Harley
Though it's hardly a job 'cause the two forms refuses
I'm an uncle now, with a newborn nephew
Follows you 'round
Broke with the bruzz
Jam with my fam'
- with my cause
We don't say it enough
So from all of my band
I'm a take a second now
To give it up to all of my fans

I just stand in the kitchen
With a plan and a vision
I'm a man on a mission
With my folk on a Fridays
Soak in the light rays
Carolina, blue sky
Coast on the highway
On track, fired up and steam-powered
Never listen to the dream-doubters at the bean counters
Join the mental, consequential song writer
Lit the island up, like a continental bonfire

My Grandma told me
Never never never take no shit
Especially that shark in the dark
'Cause that shark in the dark can suck my..
Watch your mouth!

My Grandma told me
Never never ever ever take no shit
And that's probably why my Grandpa hides
Well, my Grandma's won
My heart won't quit

26th of March
The vision is bliss
5: 55, on the 5th of the 5th
Eso poppin' in new years
Flippin' the script
It's just 380 babies chillin' in the crib
We're not givin' a shit
So respect your elders
The proof's in the pudding
That protects and shelters
So tell this to the rock in your way
I don't budge mate, you ain't got what it takes
Got Tinkerbells magic dust and I'm saddled up
Downed all the jam and I'm rattled up in a cattle truck
Paint those pics with the pallet of a dreamer
Make those sick and rally the arena
No shit, we were revved up from the start
To the sleepers we were the bedbugs in the dark
In this pool won't shed blood for the sharks
The best drug is the head rush from the art

I remember when Grandma would make the meals
My uncle didn't like bikes with training wheels
And me and mum would work at local markets for tax-free cash with a backseat dad
Which makes me the man of the house
With a girl and a great dane
Hand me the crown
That's Granny in the chair
Put your hands in the air for this family affair

Because my Grandma told me
Never never never take no shit
Especially that shark in the dark
'Cause that shark in the dark can suck my..
Watch your mouth!

My Grandma told me
Never never ever ever take no shit
And that's probably why my Grandpa hides
Well, my Grandmas won
My heart won't quit</pre>
