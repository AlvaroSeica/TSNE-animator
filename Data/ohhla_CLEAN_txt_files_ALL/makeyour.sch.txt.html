[ScholarMan]
They say I talk about real hip-hop, way too much
I say we don't talk about it enough
Let me hear you say praise to those MC's that's keepin the game balanced
Those that share they views are now walkin around silent
Leaders in they own right, see we the guiding light
I'm tryin to go down in history for the rhymes that I write
For the people I helped, sharin emotions I've felt
Define my purpose play the cards I was dealt
But, maximizin any time that I can
Knowin that my destiny rests in my hands
And in my, heart and soul I never fold but at times rough
I'ma keep pressin on until my time's up
Steadily climb up The Movement won't you sign up
The GameShift is here so make your mind up</pre>
