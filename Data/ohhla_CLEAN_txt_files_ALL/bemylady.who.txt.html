[J.D.]
Yo these niggaz ain't ready for this

[R. Kelly]
I can't wait to get it on
I can't wait to get it on
I can just feel it

[Whodini]
Whodini, 96, so so def... smooth shit

[R. Kelly]
Somebody, somebody, somebody calling me

(Be my lady)

[R. Kelly]
I can just hear it

[J.D.]
Why don't you why don't you why don't you

[R. Kelly]
Somebody, somebody, somebody calling me

It started as a small thing
Like me watching you walk
Damn she looks good
But that's the way niggaz talk
So at first it didn't phase me
Just another lady
Walked by looking fly
Catch my eye
Now usually I could see two to three to look fine
At a later time neither one is on my mind
But not with you baby
Something's crazy
Tell me what it is
Tell me why baby you make me feel like this
I've only seen you one time
But in my mind it's like a million
Never met you but want you to have my children
Right by my side through thick and thin
I see you not just as my lover but my best friend to the end
I hope to see you again so I could let you know
How I feel and what the deal is from the door
Thought I was slipping but you fit the description to a T
Of a woman I need so I wanna know

What it gonna take to get next to you
Tell you some good shit and have sex with you
Show you nothing about me's shady
And I'd love it if you be my lady
What it gonna take to get next to you
Tell you some good shit and have sex with you
Show you nothing about me shady
And I'd love it if you be my lady

In too many spots around time
I ain't got lock down
Never had a steady woman cause I like to get around
Out of the crew
I was the one who never talked about tying the knot
I couldn't see it, I couldn't see me getting got
Until I bumped heads with you
All the things I talked about not doing
Now I'm ready to do
The dance floor was the location
I saw you, you saw me
And then I started my transformation
Casing out every little thing you do
I watched you and how you make all your moves
Contemplating my approach
Take it easy or be agressive
I take two to make sure you get the message
Got my beverage and I proceeded as planned
Me letting you know how I wanna be your man
And even though I don't know you
I feel I do so
Believe me when I tell you
Cause what I feel is true, so

What it gonna take to get next to you
Tell you some good shit and have sex with you
Show you nothing about me's shady
And I'd love it if you be my lady
What it gonna take to get next to you
Tell you some good shit and have sex with you
Show you nothing about me's shady
And I'd love it if you be my lady
What it gonna take to get next to you
Tell you some good shit and have sex with you
Show you nothing about me's shady
And I'd love it if you be my lady
What it gonna take to get next to you
Tell you some good shit and have sex with you
Show you nothing about me's shady
And I'd love it if you be my lady

(Come on baby, come on baby, I said come on girl)

[R. Kelly]
Somebody's calling for me
See I'm wise enough to know when someone's yearning for me, lady
Can I sing it again?
See I'm wise enough to know when your body's yearing for me, yes I am
So So Def, R. Kelly, mmm
So So Def, R. Kelly</pre>
