That girl ooh, that girl ooh, that girl, that girl, that girl
Ooh that girl, that girl, that girl, oh talk about that girl that girl
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
That girl, that girl, that girl...

Say look at me baby, I've been looking at you too
Trying to understand the thing that you want MJ to do
Ain't it funny how the time easily slips away
I've been thinking about you sugar every moment every day
And we lay upon the beach we can each get cosy
On the other end where the people don't know me
Show me, any little thing that you feel like
Let me know the spot that gets you hot and make it feel right
Introduce some plans, to the elementary game
We can be connected with a number and a name
Strange how women make you chase them for awhile
Then when you approach them they get timid like a child
Ain't no sugar in my tank, no deductions in my bank
Never never, mad mad this steels to clever
But I'm trying to get her on a trip of my world
Seven days, six nights -- that girl

That girl, that girl knows that shes so fine
I've got to have her in my life (that girl, that girl)
What could I do to make her understand
That I could surely be her man (that girl, that girl)

Take a nigga baby can we get out, go oversea
Don't mind at the house bring you body with me
I've been really taking notes on the way that you maintain
You're one out of akind entitled to the same thing
Opportunity knocks for you girl let it be
Yet it don't stop to the ?
I know you've wondering how long could it last
But trust in the future and let the day be the past
I'm taking you dancing, you've just got good legs
But all I vision is some real good times
That we could be having in the blink of an eye
Impossible dream we can achieve if we try
It's the brother who cut for youMentally and physically
What would it take for you, do you really want to get with G's
My mission to hold my angel my pearl
But we still live as strangers -- that girl

That girl, that girl knows that she's so fine
I've got to have her in my life (that girl, that girl)
What could I do to make her understand
That I should surely be her man (that girl, that girl)

You look marvellous in your jeans, that queen
Thinking about the entrance you made at the club scene
You know you're looking goodSo I just let it ride
Too many in the hood that have already tried
They said you be looking for things I can't produce
Like a fast life, and quick dreams
To tell you the truth, competiton is blowing my hustle about position
Concidences keep us apart
It's hard to listen to somebody that you don't even trust
you don't know
Places that I want you to come, you don't go
Half all playing the game of cat and mouse
But before you start running your mouth or getting out
You don't want a man, you want somebody to play with
Knowing it's impossible for you to stay with
So real don't forget that I said
Probem is went to her head

That girl knows that she's so fine
I've got to have her in my life (that girl, that girl)
What could I do to make her understand
That I could surely be her man (that girl, that girl) x2

I want you (I want you)I want to see you (I want to see you)
I'll do anything (I'll do anything)
Girl if you don't want to (don't want to)
I won't force you (force you)
I want to find someone who wants to be right here right in my world
I want you (I want you)I want to see you (I want to see you)
