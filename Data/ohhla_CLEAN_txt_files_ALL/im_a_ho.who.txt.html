[Intro]
I'm ready (here we go)
Yo Donkey? (Yo whassup man?)
Yo what's happenin tonight man?
(I'm goin to check out a few skeezers over there, y'knahmsayin?)
Yo man I seen a lot of skeezers in this place tonight, man
(I know I'm ready to do the wild thing, knahmsayin?)
(And, and-and, it goes a little somthin like this)

[Verse One]
Some say it's a art, some say it's a shame
You would give me yo' body, before your name
But I'm a jigga - high, and I'm a jigga - low
I'm a jigga, wherever, it can go
So later on don't act like you don't know
When I pick out the freaks, in the front row
I'm the rapper Jay, that's the rapper Ex'
We're known for playin, tag team sex
When I get you in the house, you know what I do
Well let me tell you a story that's definitely true
When I came to the party I was by myself
Nine times out of ten I leave with someone else
It's somethin about, the way I rock the microphone
The ladies in the place wanna, take me home
Stretch me out all along the couch
and show me what good lovin is all about
So when I get 'em, then I let 'em
I throw my jimmy on the top and then I wet 'em

[Chorus]
Cause I'm a ho, you know I'm a ho
I rock three different freaks after every show
Cause I'm a ho you, know I'm a ho
How do you know? Cause I told you so

[Verse Two]
Now the lover of many I just may be
But I'll never touch another man's property
So if you got a little momma, you wanna keep her neat
Then keep the little freak, off my street
Cause if she comes knockin at my door
It's my duty to give her what she came here for
What can I say? That's the life I live
Now how's your wife, and my kids?

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
Now if knock on your door you should open it up
You wanna know who it is? The neighborhood slutbuster!
Rockin freaks, all through the week
Now when I say freaks, I mean the ones with the sneaks
I mean the ones with the nerve, the ones with the guts
to call me a ho when they're givin it up
So I think it's 'bout time, you all learned a lesson
Slutbusters is our new profession!

[Chorus]

[Interlude: repeat 2X]
A-dicky-dicky-dicky-dicky-dicky-dick-what?
A-dicky-dicky-dicky-dicky-dicky-dick-who?

[Verse Four]
Now if knock on your door you should open it up
You wanna know who it is? The neighborhood slutbuster!
Rockin freaks, all through the week
Now when I say freaks, I mean the ones with the sneaks

[Interlude] - 2X</pre>
