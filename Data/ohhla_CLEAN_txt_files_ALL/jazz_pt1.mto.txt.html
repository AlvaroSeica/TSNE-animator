Yo I be getting lit listening to Sun Ra
early George Benson on down the Hampton Hall

Steve Cole, George Cables all up in the rhodes
see the Walt and Herbie Hancock drop the heavy load

Gene Harris and the Three Sounds for soul jazz listeners
Bobby Hutcherson up late geared to the Jazz Messengers 
Horace Silver (Bill Evans) to Terry Gibbs on the vibe Gary Burton and album archives

like Donald Byrd George Duke and Lee Morgan
Shirley Scott 
Groove Holmes 
and Jimmy Smith up on the organ

Gene Russell, the artist symbol of Chicago
inivators like Michael White push out the Cal Tjader
classic shit like Weather Report or Max Roach
laid back like Freddie Hubbard trumpet notes
Cannonball Adderley 
Eddie Harris 
Mill Jackson*

like Ron Carter's basslines will beat you like a backspin
yeah like a backspin
we got the jazz my man

yo, who's got skills like Rahsaan Roland Kirk or conduct like William Fisher, go to work with the swisher

up and John Coltrane up in my headphones
Gary Bartz, Mister Rub produce Lovetones

even Cool and the Gang got jazz for that ass
Modern Jazz Quartet always got the A class

Johnny Hammis met Carl Sanders
Paul Bley 
Thelonious Monk 
Norman Conners

Albert Ayler
John Coltrane 
McCoy Tyner

Dizzy Gillespie is presented by Don Sebesky

I be cranking mad jack
got mad stacks of cool-out
you know we pull the smoke tool out

I give props to Bluenote
and Black Jazz
Impulse* 
CTI records and
Plusga

Verve to Milestone
Atlantic and Muse
there's plenty more that I could name
but ya'll won't put them to use 

anyway
I love jazz my man
we got the jazz
we got the jazz
