welcome to fantastic land of the miracle
home of the black carnation and neon green marigold
welcome to fantastic land of the miracle
home of the pink pit bull and chain link steering wheel

aint no rappers like me man
cause there ain't no rapper like me man X2

I go by Time im either your favorite rapper or you don't like me
either way there's people standing in line (justa) waiting to bite
so I escaped to this place called fantastic
where everybody has a lover and a mattress
this album fell into my head, driving through the mountains
listening to Jay-Z with my lady
you could hate me, my music gets jacked either way
so shows is the only time people pay me
I've been smiling ever since I dropped the anchor
I dropped the gossip, I dropped the hate and the anger
hey mom I got a new album
and I promise it'll have a better outcome
cuz now my attitude's nothing but positive
I got inflated lungs with rocky mountain oxygen
in this place there's no hoochies, only women
the fish can fly and the pigeons are swimming
the drinking fountains got green tea
magenta scenery, where your dreams are free
plus there's no nuns or shriners trying to be mean to me
paradise is what this seems to be
throw your ego off the cliff and leave it be
this is fantastic, its raining earthworms the soil's pushing up babies
and all the children are sneezing daisies
I was born in the 80's ill be rapping till im 80
fantastic is crazy, there's no if's but's or maybe's
just good food, music, and literate ladies
christopher walkens wearing mascara
and instead of cucumbers over his eyes
he's got 2 pennies

welcome to fantastic land of the miracle
home of the black carnation and neon green marigold

cause there ain't no rapper like me man

I see 3 little rappers trying to hitchhike
thinking they're big tikes, trying to pick fights
and everytime they battle they try to win it with a fist fight
they saying they rip mics, and don't like what chris writes
but everything that chris writes is what the kids bite

never mind the negative fantastic don't have it
only 7 glasses a day, no procrastination and good habits
theres no cuss words here, just gosh darns and gee gollies
just sal dali and a superhero named molly
its my sophomore album so I guess I got to say it
guess who's back, with an over used line thats wack
it's time with a noisy cricket that goes BLAP!!!!!
it used to be tumbleweeds now its plastic sacks
it used to be old skool now its fantastic raps
put an emcee in front of me I swear ill murder him
especially if hes just your favorite
cause no ones ever heard of him
but there's no such thing as death
this world's a dream each lifetime's a breath
I wanna meet bobby dylan, tom waits and all the greats
I'm not gonna lie, I wanna be richer then my mom
I wanna quit my job, I want your girlfriend to know my songs
fantastics my escape
theres no ego, or guilt just plenty of forgiveness
theres no radical Christians atheists or jehovas witness
christopher walkens wearing eye shadow
he's stacking his Benjamin's
as far as money he's got plenty
