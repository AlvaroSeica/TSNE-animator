Oh yeah I chill with Nate, Like I did as a youth
It's still 213, ain't nothin different with Snoop
Music is the tool I used to leave the hood with
Became my own man, I wish you would BITCH
I been around the world and back
Two times ain't nuthin like home its crackin
After all the women, the money and the TV shows
I'm not really tryin to see these hoes

[DJ Quik]
Now AMG said her eyes are the index to her soul
But when I look at her face, all I see is a ho
We sex playin, with the Hennessey, and she in the mood
While y'all see her as a broad dude, I see her as food
Take her back up to the bar to get her cigerette lit
I told her, "I be buyin liqour like it Shh.."
She told me I'm a player motherfuu..
Forget about it, she know the scam
And now she belly dancin to that Indian Jam
So hell, I'm a let her get a little more buzzed
Till she starts to get to slurrin and forget where she was
Take her purse out to her buddy car, back to the bar
For another round of drinks with a pla-ti-num star
I'm gettin conceded, a lil bit, the game owe me
I've been humble since my first hit, but back to baby
I'm a rub her on the belly, make her scoot down the couch
Look her right up in her eyes, and take some food out her mouth, She want it

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
There she goes, the kind of girl that I wanted always
My favorite pro, oh I love how she got gangsta ways
I thought you should know, the way that I want it, I get it that way
Cant stand it no mo', nobody does it better than she

[Nate Dogg]
When I Wake up in the morning, fresh up outta my dream
I ain't even finish yawning, still as hard as I can be
Even tho I havent found her, I seen her when I was asleep
I'm pretty sure that she is out there
I'm pretty sure that there is some one else for me

[Bridge: Nate Dogg]
Hey ho, Hey ho, now that I found you, I wont look any further
Hey ho, Hey ho, now that I found you, I wont look any further

[Chorus]

[Nate Dogg]
The first time I ever saw her, I couldnt look her in her face
I tried hard to ignore her, but I couldnt walk away
When I finally got the courage, I couldnt think of what to say
To make a long story shorter, I better bust a different way
I was at the park one day, thats when I saw her face
She was kinda cavi to me
Had some nigga hangin on, I sent that busta home
And now she ridin with me.. THERE SHE GOES!!!

[Chorus] - 2X</pre>
