[Intro: Popa Chief]
This one I call; "What Not 2 Do"
Uh-huh, yeah, Popa Chief
Last of the Mohicans, for all my ghetto children
What a wonderful world this would be
If grown folks'll stop cutting up
What a wonderful world this could be

[Popa Chief]
It's been a long hard struggle, folks ask what took so long
My reply is 'how do I begin, what didn't go wrong'
Money should of been long, I should of been on
Baby meals with the haters thinking I shouldn't move on
Moms disappointed, she wanted a lawyer, a doctor
Out of all the things you could of been, you chose to be a rapper
Never laid eyes on my father, that's why I teach my seeds
Strive for perfection, always try harder
Learn from my mistakes, do whatever it takes
With raw held accountable for the rules he break
Remember, when it's bad, it could always be worse
We can all be dressed up riding in a back of a herse
Keep your head up, and never give up
So your friend and down and out, help him up, pick him up, cuz
You never know when you might need a lift up
Right is right, war is wrong, size shoes up

[Chorus: Popa Chief]
If we took the time to teach these children
What a wonderful world it could be
If we all stop fighting, robbing and killing
What a wonderful world it could be
If everybody came together as one mind
What a wonderful world it could be
If we just all got together and had a good time
What a wonderful world it could be

[Popa Chief]
The world we live in, is always gonna be a cess pool
Whose the dummy, whose the fool, what's really cool?
Rappers kicking, taxi cab confessions
And the law's listening, satellite's watching
Twas the night before the raid, and all through the hood
The fiend steady chirping, gangstas up to no good
And that's when the DT's swarmed, and crack heads
Running the weeds, and lost the water pressure in the hood, from all the flushing
When the smoke clear, all the cool is not here
Ain't gon' see him for a couple of years
Back on the bricks in a few, strike two
Bragging about his last come up and what he's about to do
Keep on listening to them rappers, if you want to
Sling one more crack rock, I dare you
Ain't SSI in hustling, thugging
Dreams about being a kingpin'll get you in the state pen

[Chorus]

[Outro: Popa Chief]
If the grown ones just act grown
What a wonderful world it could be
If everybody left the BS alone
What a wonderful world it could be
Now ya'll go the hell on up out of here
Let me see ya'll out here hustling
Begging for money, get a paper route, that's gangsta
Read a good book, that's gangsta, mmm, you heard
I break foot all off up in your ---
Ya'll think I'm playing if ya'll want to
I ain't got no change... aight... beat it
And remember, never laugh at a bum, cuz you might just become one
You heard? That's coming from Popa Chief, remember that
Put that in your peace pipe and smoke it
Word up... BKZU representing, South Jersey's finest representing
Thank you for joining my Pow Wow...</pre>
