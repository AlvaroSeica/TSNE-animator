[Intro: 12 O'Clock]
Yo yo yo y'all
You hear that shit?
Yeah...

[12 O'Clock]
Niggaz watch a lot, they be watchin' that watch
But it could be fake, got stones from a fishtank
I want that house with the lake in the back
So I could bury niggaz like I buried them stacks
From the coke robbery, my man on Lancast'
To keep it quiet a nigga got shot bad
I was on dust, weed and hash
Movin' fast, two and pass, to the pad
We picked up about six titties and three ass
Some Puerto Rican chicks we met up the ave
For niggaz on Riker's Isle and them covers got crabs
Heard the story, big nigga had niggaz in the bag
Pulled a mama there, muscle-bound nigga was a fag
He'll knock a nigga out then fuck him in the ass
I need a whip that treads fast and a glock in the stash
And a bitch in the past' and the Porsche go fast

[Interlude: Prodigal Sunn]
First thing first mothafucka
We gotta get that money, man nahImean?
Then you get the... money brings power, nigga!
Nigga don't cut me off, I'm tellin' you some real shit here!
Shut the fuck up!
Now if you gon' listen, listen
I gotta get the fuck outta here!
That's right, nigga!
When realest talk real shit over here, nigga!
Strictly from my mothafuckin' G
Now make that money and you get the honies

[Chi-King]
Aiyo I got that, I'm a hard head without a hard hat
Hit you where you smart, have you leakin' like a faucet
Punchline's offset, blood type awkward, supreme force that I walk with
Most niggaz like to talk it, Chi-King like to outline and chalk it
Try porcelain bracelet, talk first to walk it
G. Rap Bjork it, Brooklyn New York shit
Who want that raw shit? Let's go, we on it

[Raison the Zoo Keeper]
Mr. MC Glorious, I roast and toast it
Brooklyn still stickin' niggaz, you know I'm totin'
You could tell by the look in my eyes, this a no win situation
I'm that stick-up kid
Give me all you got or you might get popped
Around here, two hops, no walk off the the spot
Zoo Keeper/War Chief, nigga from the Hampton
Cuffies still runnin' these streets and then we ramp 'em
Shinnecock, get it cocked, step off the jock
They said I had a little bit, now I got a lot

[Interlude: Prodigal Sunn]
Them niggaz ain't tell you mothafucka?
Yo Ray got these streets locked, nigga
Empty yo' mothafuckin' pocket
Empty yo' mothafuckin' pockets, nigga!
I ain't gon' tell you again!
Chi-King rip out his neck, mothafucka!

[Prodigal Sunn]
Yo Sunny focused like a telescope, cash in the envelope
Cleaner than a bar of soap, note Taurus my horoscope
No scopin' the scene, no holdin' the king
Quote, rollin' the green, the universal sixteen
Splendid guillotine, shark burn gasoline
Let off a little steam, shatter bones, splatter teams
I'm from the Brook where it's real, ain't no in between
Now watch me sizzle lean, triple CREAM by any means
So many dreams, no self-esteem, I know the theme
And though it may seem, a lot of niggaz play the scheme
I get that money and think not before I plot
It's the Sunzini, nigga, I'ma stay hot

[Outro: Raison the Zoo Keeper]
Yeah y'all
