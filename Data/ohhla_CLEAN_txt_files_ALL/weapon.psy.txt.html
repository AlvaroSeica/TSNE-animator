Yung Buk
Oh yes I'm lethal
I make my shit equal to no one
like shogun I blow one
I don't rap I flow son
You cain't fuck wit my criteria
cuz in my high school cafeteria 
I'm known as superior
but now I rock stages
I used to rock the cover of books
but now I open'em up and rock them pages
massive dope shit I drop and brother's not comprehendin
that's why this nigga raps like it aint no endin
no brother can two upon the one 
cuz I'm the nigga who recked the Chi
and locked it up when I was done
you wanna funky rhyme you ain't gotta force me
a young nigga droppin shit like a horse G
I take your crew and wipe'em like mildew
and as for you I got a class that slaughter too
you can sit your ass down and learn the bits of this psychodrama shit
that you cain't fuck wit
correct so when I inject all you bitches keep steppin
cuz I'm a lethal weapon

Chorus: Yung Buk, NewSense
As lethal as I'm flexin
niggas still talkin bout who dat? (who dat?)
so the next time I bust a cap
it'll be on you black
As lethal as I'm flexin
niggas still talkin bout who dat? (who dat?)
so the next time I bust a cap
it'll be on you black
we gettin that motherfucker
PsychoDrama, too much for the industry to handle
PsychoDrama, too much for the industry to handle
PsychoDrama, too much for the industry to handle

Verse Two:
I'm versatile wit my style
this juvenile can come harder
and kick some wicked shit as fat as Nell Carter
when I flow my rhymes grow like a embryo
still fa sho and then come back like your feenin' hoe
you wonderin who's the best
some punk might say maybe me
but when I flex I'm drastic like casualty
I'm straight underground
no nigga can take mine
fuck a bitch man I'm sleepin wit a tech nine
I bury a body and break a bitches back
cuz you's a sad ass 
you sissy soft sucker I'm a bad ass niggaro
and I figured yo you cain't hang wit my mental slang
hell yeah I shoot that motherfuckin thang
I'm hard as fuck so motherfuckers disbelieve
and got mo' hoes than Santa Claus on Christmas Eve
you can not fuck wit me your homie will say yes he's right
I'll take your rep, your bitch, you'll flip from me like Jesse White
and love ya tender
I bend a body like a fender
and to them bitches front to back aint no surrender
here never

Chorus 2x

Verse 3:
Any and every punk bitch thats fake
I leave'em soggy like corn flakes
motherfuckers try and die wrapped to your brainwave
bitch itty itty bang bang
shit static dismissed niggaro 
fuck yourself up because you fuckin wit this ill shit
I won't blow you a kiss I punch in your fuckin mouth bitch
nigga just chill or catch the steal fist
now when I says I'm a Yung Buk
don't get an idea nigga fuckin
that you can come and fuck wit this here
the shit that I kick ain't simple
a nigga layin in the river dead wit his dick drilled in his temple
I guess that's how it's gotta be
niggas jumpin up and gettin they ass played like the lottery
dialog fonky punk you fail to realize
diggin through your crackerjacks and shit try to find the prize
but aint no prize fool
yeah you can get your ass bucked by a nigga fresh outta high school
wit dialog to kill you like a hog
chase you like a dog
slit your throat and drink your blood like egg nog
and thats a still

psychodrama, yeah that other shit
recognize bitch
ChiTown, ChiTown

Chorus 2x</pre>
