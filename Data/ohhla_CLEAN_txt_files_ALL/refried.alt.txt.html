[Mexican Male]
{*Mexican cry*}
Orale, A.L.T.
What's up, holmes
No one's ever done a song about frijoles
You know, beans
Refried beans, holmes

[A.L.T. and the Lost Civilization]
(Verse 1)
Caviar, naw, and I tried it twice
I want some beans with a side of rice
Refried, refried, re- (WHAT)
Beans
Gotta watch out, you might rip your jeans
Cause the buildup holds gasses, it passes
Our asses
And it surpasses
The toxic lover, watch the O-Zone burn
But I still, what, but
But I still yearn
For some refried beans
Please don't doubt 'em
Don't talk about 'em, I can't live without 'em
Mexican, Mexican, I love to eat them
Beans
Cause I can't afford meat
Motownphilly
Yeah, that was silly
A bowl of beans and a jalapeno chile

Refrain: A.L.T. and the Lost Civilization
Eat 'em with a friend
Eat 'em in teens
But you gotta eat (WHAT)
Eat them refried beans

(Verse 2)
I was in bed, I was fast asleep
The house was quiet, was no, not a peep
I woke up cause I thought I heard clappin' {*clapping sounds*}
Grandma's up in the kitchen, slappin'
The dough together
Mama mia
A bowl of beans and a fresh tortilla
One more bowl, one more bowl, please
Easy on the salt, but with extra cheese
I'm addicted, yes, I'm a fiend
Not for crack, but
A pinto bean
Gimme one, gimme one, gimme one, fast
For I'll get gas, and we'll have a blast

Repeat Refrain

[Mexican Male]
Ay, chihuahua
This song is hotter than a jalapeno
It's got me jumpin' like a Mexican jumpin' bean, holmes
Dame mas frijoles, dame mas

(Verse 3)
PASS ME THE TUMS
Cause that's what happens, and that's what comes
With eating a bowl of frijoles
Holy moley
The guacamole
Is on the side
IS ON THE SIDE
Forget that stake holmes, I got my pride
Some homeboy tried to hide
My bowl of beans, but it was suicide
I want a lot
And pipin' hot
Grandma makes in a big ol' pot
Someone gave me some navy beans
I couldn't do 'em
So I threw 'em
And no, I didn't try to barbecue 'em
Because they fall through the barbecue grill
No more jokes, homeboy, just chill

Repeat Refrain

[A.L.T. and the Lost Civilization]
Refried, refried, refried beans
Refried, refried, refried beans
Refried, refried, refried beans
Refried, refried, refried beans
Refried, refried, refried beans
Refried, refried, refried beans
Refried, refried, refried beans
Refried, refried, refried beans

[Mexican Male]
{*Mexican cry*}
LA FIESTA
VAMOS, ORALE, ORALE, ORALE
{*Mexican cry*}
Que viva A.L.T. and Mexico
Orale, vieja, vamos a bailar, vamos
Whoo, passa el tequila
Nos vamos a poner pejo
{*Mexican cry*}</pre>
