[Lauryn singing - Chorus]
Everything Is Everything
What is meant to be, will be
After winter, must come spring
Change, it comes eventually
(2x)

[Singing - Verse One]
I wrote these words for everyone who struggles in their youth
Who won't accept deception, in--instead of what is truth
It seems we lose the game
Before we even start to play
Who made these rules? (Who made these rules?)
We're so confused (We're so confused)
Easily led astray
Let me tell ya that...

[Chorus]
Everything Is Everything
Everything Is Everything
After winter, must come spring
Everything Is Everything

[Rapping - Verse Two]
I philosophy
Possibly speak tongues
Beat drum, Abyssinian, street Baptist
Rap this in fine linen, from the beginning
My practice extending across the atlas
I begat this
Flipping in the ghetto on a dirty mattress
You can't match this rapper slash actress
More powerful than two Cleopatras
Bomb graffiti on the tomb of Nefertiti
MCs ain't ready to take it to the Serengeti
My rhymes is heavy like the mind of sister Betty (Betty Shabazz!)
L-Boogie spars with stars and constellations
Then came down for a little conversation
Adjacent to the king, fear no human being
Roll with cherubims to Nassau Coliseum
Now hear this mixture, where Hip Hop meets scripture
Develop a negative into a positive picture

[Chorus]
Now Everything Is Everything
What is meant to be, will be
After winter, must come spring
Change, it comes eventually

[Lauryn Singing - Verse Three]

Sometimes it seems
We'll touch that dream
But things come slow or not at all
And the ones on top, won't make it stop
So convinced that they might fall
Let's love ourselves and we can't fail
To make a better situation
Tomorrow, our seeds will grow
All we need is dedication 
Let me tell ya that...

[Chorus]
Everything Is Everything
Everything Is Everything
After winter, must come spring
Everything Is Everything

Everything Is Everything
What is meant to be, will be
After winter, must come spring
Change, it comes eventually
