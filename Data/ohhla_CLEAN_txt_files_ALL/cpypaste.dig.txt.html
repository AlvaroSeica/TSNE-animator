Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Uh, it's Diggy..
Queens, you with me?
Yeah, let's get it... let's get it..

Uh, check my million dollar swag
I tell 'em ten four cause they wanna copy that, uh
In the mall lotta shopping bags
Baby girl what you want. Your boy got the tab
If ya man say, "Where you at? "
I'm a tell 'em, "I ain't seen her"
Better hit her on her jag
She's gone for the evening
I make dem lean back Don Cartegena
Yeah you know what's up Martin, Tommy, Gina
I'm a leader like Derek Jeter
They copy my domineer
I'd be jocking I know they're watching
They act like I don't see 'em but (ohhh)

[Chorus]
I'll never stop
Keep me on the job when they be tryna
Copy and paste me, copy and paste me
I'm on and I be in my Zone and they be tryna
Copy and paste me, copy and paste me
I'm gone

My shoe game look here I'm rockin 'em
Moccasins or go Jeremy Scott on 'em
Loubotin look like they got spots on it
My ratings up cause everybody's watching it
I be V.I.P you in line where the rope is
Don't come any closer, you might step on my toe, just
Ladies it's your jam leave your jacket on the sofa
Have a little class, put your glass on the coaster
Get it on the floor shake it
Shake it like you're supposed to if you know getting over
Tell 'em copy copy over

[Chorus]
I'll never stop
Keep me on the job and they be tryna
Copy and paste me, copy and paste me
I'm on and I be in my zone when they be tryna
Copy and paste me, copy and paste me
I'm gone

Copy paste, copy copy paste [x2]
Everything that I do they tryna do the same (the same thing)
Copy paste, copy copy paste [x2] tryna do it how I do it they can't do it like me (like me)
Copy paste copy copy paste copy paste paste (paste paste paste)

[Chorus]
I'll never stop
Keep me on the job and they be tryna
Copy and paste me, copy and paste me
I'm on and be in my zone and they be tryna
Copy and paste me, copy and paste me
I'm gone</pre>
