Song:   All I Know
Typed by: Alesmola

[Chorus: Jozeemo]
(All I know
I've been cool for too long
I'm so tired
And my nerves are just gone)

[Verse One: Jozeemo]
Yo, I try to chill but I can't
Well I can but I ain't
Cuz I never hurt a Saint
Jo Ziggy, Roll Wit me 
Blow sticky cuz I'm stressed out
Time to whip the vest out
Holster under either shoulder Soulja Smif N' Wess'ed out
Now I got's to get it in, You should be considerin'
Is Jo' just talkin' reckless or he really on that shit again
Juggernaut gymnastic acrobatic ratchet tumbler
Bold nigga humbler, Bring it to any one of ya
Cockin and what the fuck, you don't know what that is
But when it bang, you be like what the fuck just happened to my Nig'?
Wheelchair niggaz forever, shit baggin and then some
To take a bath you gon' need Mr. Belvedere and Branson
Not to mention I be poppin' Oxycontin's faithfully
If I got the eight with me then you should stay away from me
Joe Young, King of the Jungle, Guerilla Tactics
Pump a slug into you cowards and watch ya backflip

[Chorus: Jozeemo - singing]
(All I know)
You niggaz talking about kickin' in doors
Like I ain't got a hammer bigger than yours
(I've been cool for too long, cool for too long)
(I'm so tired)
Pussy niggaz wanna take my shine
Well, see the chrome? Come holla bitch, take my nine
(And my nerves are just gone, nerves are just gone)

[Verse Two: Sean Price]
Ayo asalaam aaikum, Alakium Salaam
Sean you taking too long to make a song
fuck it, I make it strong when I make a song
And I can tell by my sales you ain't wait for Sean
I take it back like to the break of dawn
Break ya arm, Sean a wrestler, One life to live, Carlos Hessler
You just a human poster or a vest-tester
The sket-presser the wet wetter than red sweater
The def leppard, the best effort, you can't rock
And my new, some old nigga you can't stop
Listen, I rap rings around niggaz, clap things about nigga
See you later, ya'll muthafuckaz is haters
Four fit for the four-fifth flasher
Flash the four-fifth in ya face, Make PLASTER
David Blaine duke, Abra-Cadabra 
I wave the thing, poof, I got to GET AT YA (I'm already THA rapper)

[Chorus: Jozeemo - singing]
(All I know)
You niggaz talking about kickin' in doors
Like I ain't got a hammer bigger than yours
(I've been cool for too long, cool for too long)
(I'm so tired)
Pussy niggaz wanna take my shine
Well, see the chrome? Come holla bitch, take my nine
(And my nerves are just gone, nerves are just gone)</pre>
