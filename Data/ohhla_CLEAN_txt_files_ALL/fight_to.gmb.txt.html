Song:   Fight to Win
Typed by: thenumber1superman@yahoo.com

Fight to win, stand up straight 
No debate, pushed by hate
Concentrate, penetrate, generate, motivate 
Live by faith, keep believing
I know the reason, it's the season
Now's the time, keep on dreaming
Keep on leading
And keep on fighting

[Cee-Lo]
I am fighting, for the liberation
Of voices with something to say Like many before me
For glory
You'll have to stand in harm's way
I'm no Savior, just a soldier
Soldier with an order
So I have no choice but to trust in God
Cause it must be done
My only fear, is what might have been
If I didn't fight to win!

[Chorus]
If I loose, it was worth fighting for
If I win, I only live to fight again
If I loose, it was worth fighting for
If I win, I only live to fight again

[Hook]
Who are, We are, they are too
Can't turn back to far to
You are, we are, they are too
(I'll be there)
(Fight, fight, fight)

[Cee-Lo]
You should be proud for the courage
The courage to think out loud
You'll find your way
If you're foolish enough to be faithful
Believe me, it won't be easy
But it's surely not impossible
And if they won't listen
Save your breath, and save yourself
And as soon, as you see sunlight again
Get up and fight to win!

[Cee-Lo]
If we loose, it was worth fighting for
If we win, we only live to fight again
If we loose, it was worth fighting for
If we win, we only live to fight again

(Fight!)
Till you push yourself
Till your last breath
For your spirit, for your mind
For your soul
Never loose sight
Keep up the fight
(Fight!)
When all fails and you done tried everything in life
Keep your head up, keep, keep, keep your head up</pre>
