[Truck]
For ya rabbit ass mine, saying I can't eat
You better keep on walking, nigga, move them feet
Before them bullets start flying, and you feel that heat
Hit ya man while he pull off in the driver seat
It's Truck, muthafucka and I'm not playing
I hope you clown ass niggas hear every word I'm saying
Speaking, loud and clear, Ruthless is here
Nigga, pump on the loosy, bitch, sip on your beer
It's 2004, man, this is our year
If you need that good shit, well Truck's that nigga
Think the ferry money looking right, plans getting bigger
Man, please, picture me soft
I split ya melon, there's rules, hop in the whip and sped off
I can't go back to the hood unless I pop ya fucking head off
Now here's something I never understood
How you doing it for the hood, but your never in the hood
Call yourself a hustler, but ya crack's no good
My money in the stash, nigga, that's no good
Big spender, you trick too much, giving up hundreds
Just for a kiss and a touch
And I'm not giving these bitches nothing but some dick in the gut
You feel me homey? Now pass the weed
So I can get my head right, nigga, yes indeed
Listen, pa, I really don't know what you thinking
I'm trying to have a smokefest, like them dreds in Kingston
I'm what these streets need, who gives a fuck if you think not
Rap's up and coming, and my guns'll pop

[Chorus: Apocalipps]
Aiyo, this is our game, ya'll niggas is finished
Ruthless Bastardz, and we destined to win it
We gon' ride on these niggas, lay 'em down like a new born
Whoever coming with me, get the fuck in the Yukon
This is my year, my block, my set
Stay the fuck out the streets if you ain't gon' rep, faggot
If you ain't gon' rep, bitch

[Apocalipps]
Apocalipps, I think you losing your touch, what?
Shit, you need to slow down, you do it too much
You birds fly away, and who the fuck is this lame?
You should feel like Alicia Keys, cuz I don't even know ya fucking name
Tuck in your chain, I put one in your brain
The Bastardz is all here, and we one in the same
I play with my style, because the shit is like practice
You ever bag a bad bitch off the strength of your jacket
Or, caught in a situation, shit start happening
And have to lay a nigga down, off the strength of the ratchet
Retaliation is related to this, a man and a woman
Grimy's a nigga, payback is a back
I put ya'll clowns on the bench, now ya'll singing the blues
All of a sudden, everybody think they can walk in my shoes
Follow the leader, I ain't never been the hater
And I'mma show you, how you and your team can get ya weight up
First off, see the Wiz, get some heart, muthafucka
To back that shit up that's in your darts, muthafucka
Soon as you bite, I'm lacing your team up
And I'm quick to catch a case, muthafucka, like I'm chasing that singer
Get it? Chasing that singer, I got bass on my fingers
That make all the fiends linger, the whole block's off the ringer
And this here, goes for anybody trying to play me
I got guns that can fire ya ass like Don Cheney</pre>
