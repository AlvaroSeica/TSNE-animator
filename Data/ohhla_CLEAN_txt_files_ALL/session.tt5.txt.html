{"Just Blaze!"} You KNOW

Family, YEAH, Nickel!

[Royce Da 5'9"]
If any one of you players in here oppose me
I'll tear your season apart like D. Rose knee
Call me the original gangster, O.G.
I'll split your head to the white meat, poultry
That's why my legacy starts where your era begins
I've taken over this franchise like Jeremy Lin
Y'all niggaz buyin your own albums, you pay to sell
Who dare to compare an Alpha to a Beta male?
You lames ain't as hot as me, look the other direction
I'll turn your brain to cottage cheese like some butt injections
Baby that naval piercin just ain't gon' work
if your fuckin stomach lookin like some balled-up homework
I'm the flyest nigga flyin here, Ryan yeah
Pioneer, try me here, you're dyin here
I am where the guided, where the iron, where?
It's only Just, me and Tony Touch
Sippin Patr√≥n out a Styrofoam-y cup
Nickel!

[Crooked I]
50 MC's, how many fans can Tony +Touch+?
Special hoes call us testicles, they know we nuts
I'm the opposite of horny sluts - I don't give a fuck!
When it come to shootin, I'm Kobe Clutch
Uhh, put them on mute when they know the boss is speakin
Our album comin out before it's s'posed to, that's how I leave 'em leakin
Pussy, you tampon, I'm in San Juan with some Puerto Ricans
that'll merk you in church, and ignore the deacon
Ow~! I'm the god of the West Coast
Lot of niggaz rappin over there, I'm the best though
House Gang matchin in escrow, nigga my neck glow
Like OD'in on coke, you'll get the death blow
I +Run D's MC's+ like Master J
Don't get it backwards like Paul Revere, rest in peace MCA
(Yeah!) AK's, semis and clips
I'm from Long Beach Eastside the city of Crips, cuz

[Joell Ortiz]
Uhh, yeah, you are now tuned in
Man I hope you've been tuned in to the most influen-
-tial beat-ruinin human being on fluid
Puerto Rican speakin, check me out with the YAOWA movement
I'm Mr. Everybody's Favorite Line
Mr. Unofficial Remixer, hop on there and make it mine
Mr. Stage Ripper, send that grip and ain't a place and time
Mr. Never Front On The Hood, no Mercedes sign
Mr. No Missus, just dope bitches takin fine
licks of my from-behind, stick it 'til they taste the slime
I'm so gangsta, prissy chicks don't wanna fuck with me (so?)
Like I care! If it's weave in your hair
I've got trees and a beer, meet me in the stairs
Be careful cause last time you got pee on your gear
I'll never change cause I touch cake, FUCK crushed grapes
Give me Dutch papes and a Touch tape, fuck-face!</pre>
