[Verse 2]
So mutch talkin the throne that who is holdin it
Heard about a new king of the streets and started calmin it
All I see was studios and con services
Nothin but I be hearin outcome this rap verses-ists

I picked up on the accent there in my Southern slang
In fact I picked up a whole sudden game
And picked up a few producers that make the beat go BANG
Kill it
Hot damn and then we get in the game
The beat novakane the streets weak hopin and prayin
MC's built to this, little speak, mo pain
Sua pressure eye brow y'all fuckin say
To the boys who make their time listen my name
Third page obituarys all attention you gain

[Bridge]

[Verse 3]
