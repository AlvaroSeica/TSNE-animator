[Chorus x2: 12 O'Clock]
Get up, boo boo cakes and shake that ass
And uh, roll a blunt and it's two and pass
And uh, pour that Hennessey no ice, no glass
And uh, we at the club when you shakin' that ass
Get up, boo boo cakes and shake that ass
And uh, roll that blunt and it's two and pass
And uh, pour that Hennessey no ice, no glass
And uh, we at the club when you shakin' that ass, GET UP!

[Merdoc]
I came in the door, I pissed on the floor
I never let them shorties walk past me no more
Cuz this is right there in front of me, she's shakin' it around
I can't hold it back, I gots to be down
She was short, all dipped up and low sports
She had a mean walk and a 'just for me' talk
It was Maybelline, and her eyes was money green
Had her own CREAM, I think she from Fort Green

[Shorty Shitstain]
You could catch me, gettin' drunk at the bar
Movin' through the crowd like they bumpin' cars
I see it in her thigh that she from Bedstuy
Putnam and Franklin, four-four-five
She was fly, like a bird in the sky
Light-skin complexion, beautiful brown eyes
That's when I stepped to the VIP section
That's when I caught my erection

[Chorus]

[12 O'Clock]
Come here sweetheart won't you relax yaself?
Slide off them Guccis and relax yaself
Come sit next to fireplace, unfasten ya belt
Cuz what we do I never tell
Want turn out the light, listen to Patti LaBelle
Or Marvin Gaye or the finest O'Dells
See you jokin' funny like David Chappelle
And I'ma laugh at you cuz that ass is swell
When my shit hits the store, guaranteed gon' sell
When I, hit that ass, guaranteed gon' yell
See them Brooklyn Zu dudes got a story to tell
And I'ma give you 12 play like my nigga R. Kell

[Chorus]

[Buddha Monk]
Come on ma, I know it's not ya first time
Whether clubbin' or bubblin', no bras or G-strings
Nah, I ain't the type, talkin' like it's wedding night
Rather get head right than leave with you, damn right
I ain't a star but my dick a Mastercard
Quick on the widthdrawl, slow on the recharge
When seein' broads, no one needed, it's me plugged
Drinks and weed buzz, sweet six with heat tub
No time for kind man, I'm born with the crime gang
They say the better you treat 'em you get more, that's a lie man
I defy the sex with rap desire
And they give them more beats, tell them why I'm providin' for the night live then
No "does he loves or loves me not?"
Take finger pops, back shots then leave spots
And if you down for that then tell me where you rest at
Cuz the night is still young and I got plenty more bitches to get at
