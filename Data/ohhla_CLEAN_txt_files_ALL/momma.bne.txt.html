[Intro: Bizzy]
Yeah (kick back)
Dedicated to the women of the world
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Out there strugglin, tryin to make ends meet
Yeah, yeah.. yeah, yeah
C'mon, c'mon

[Bizzy Bone]
Soon, you'll be on your own with skills in the game
Takes a strong-ass lady to survive nowadays
Single mothers with no money to cover the next meal
Strong sister in the winter, cold nights like steel
Feel the shiver of the wind, seems lonely again
No friends, no man, so you can speak with djinns{?}
Now you talkin to yo'self, let the Lord provide
This time, that time, every time we ride
So you slide to the store with change because you don't have anymore
You feelin embarrassed usin coins cause you poor
Good Samaritans are born tryin to hustle the road
Can't take the babies with you so they all wind up in homes
Grow up, become rappers, make a way for momma
But right before you have a chance to enjoy it here come the drama
Passed as the record went platinum
This dedicated to the women in the world, keep at 'em, yeah

[Chorus: unknown singer]
Momma, momma...
I see your struggles momma, so I wrote this song for you
Momma...
I see your struggles momma, so I wrote this song for you

[Layzie Bone]
Hey mom, hey mom, hey mom...
You battled crack addictions, alcoholism, you and your three against the system
Nevertheless you stayed persistent, showed us love, gave us wisdom
Time in prison saved your life, remember them terrible nights?
Paid the price to raise us right, right, right?
Critical fight to run the streets, shit got deep
With nothin to eat, tryin to get up on our feet
It was hard without no father figure
Growin up in the hood was all good, at least we had our momma with us
I look at pictures of the past and I smile
You a real brick house, whylin out
Hey ma! You did a good job after all
All the struggles we've been through made us have to ball
You instilled it in me, to be a real G
You my O.G. (hey ma) you set me free

[Chorus]

[Bizzy Bone]
Stack your paper, do your thang, bang bang, you gotta maintain
Swingin lightweights for nobody probably, but love remains
Whether you're dancin in the club or servin drinks in the pub
You could be married to the mob, huh, never could I judge
Just keep your mind right, depend on the Lord, that's all you have
Pay attention to the signs, the guidelines, of the last
Heaven shall be renewed, don't be shrewd or rude
If you not written in the book of the lamb, then you're screwed
Life, is so preciously tooken, candles are cookin
Keep lookin, for a reason, yo' passion shouldn't be ruined
Watch everything that you're doin, 'member to pray like every day
Lil' Lay and B love you, Jesus Christ, the only way, hey

[Layzie Bone - singing]
You are so beautiful to me
You're so strong and independent, girl that's what I see
Baby girl, you the backbone to the world
It been that long since you heard
You deserve, to be treated like a queen

[Chorus]
