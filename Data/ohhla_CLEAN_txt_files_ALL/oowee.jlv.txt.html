[Verse 1] (J-Live)
So anyway where was I
Somewhere in between being tipsy and buzz-eye
Realize the scene was a little obscene
Shorty I was seen walking out with was not the queen but what
With a little butt-butt, but my gut told me
Wake up
Especially when she went for the car keys like
Freeze
Sweetheart, let me see these please
I'm'a give 'em to your homegirl
You get a taxi
Cuz you apparently even most master me
If we would've made it home then we might've got skeezed
When I wake up in the morning I wouldn't've been pleased
Like Boomerang when Marcus inlay the yellow weaves
But atleast that night, let me escape from the problem
The mojo was bad intact
In fact, after that episode
Outside of the spot, sober dime hawked at me coming out the car lot
She said wasn't that sweet
Aren't you the boy scout
Was that your good deed for the night
No doubt, how's about you give a drunk monk a quick ride home
If you play your cards right
I'll cook you breakfast in the morning

[Chorus]
Oowee
Baby girl excuse me
Oowee
Are you single are you free?
Oowee
I'm feeling you. You feeling me?
Oowee
Well maybe this was meant to be
Oowee
Like razor sharp candy
Oowee
Your whole style so sweet and deadly
Oowee
So elegant and sexy
Oowee
I want to feel you feeling me

[Verse 2] (J-Live)
Anyway, gas stations we pass
We got gas, went on to get grub
Get to know me, get love
Get home, get naked, get rubbed, get dirty, get clean
Wash, rinse, and repeat
Nahmean, from fiesta to siesta to fiesta
Nahmean, I am wicked in the bed, but
She was pretty mean, had a thing for
Balconies and fire escapes, glass elevators, windows with no drapes
Anyway, fast forward that night
Next few weeks with my genie of the bottle
She treated me like a sheik
What was dope was much more than simply her physique
For hours at a time on the phone we would speak 'bout
Politics, bullshit, Celtics versus Knicks
New school dancehall and old school kicks
Even Pro Tools mixed and shorty was an engineer
But one night, she put a little something in my ear
She said, what we have here is really rather unique
But I'm happily single, fully intent to mingle
She said, recognize that or our future is bleak
I said, shit, consider me your On Demand freak

[Chorus]
Oowee
Baby girl excuse me
Oowee
Are you single are you free?
Oowee
I'm feeling you. You feeling me?
Oowee
Well maybe this was meant to be
Oowee
Like razor sharp candy
Oowee
Your whole style so sweet and deadly
Oowee
So elegant and sexy
Oowee
I want to feel you feeling me

[Verse 3] (J-Live)
So okay
So we here now, so far, so good
So there ain't no disguising
The temperature was rising
I'm realizing, she cut off all her other guys
And it seemed like she was sizing me up for a tux
And I can't say I'm surprised when shorty was catching feelings
I won't front, the thought of getting comfy was appealing
Besides the good company and sexual healing
That had her downstairs and they was banging on the ceiling
I'm sorry, I hate to play the role of the villain
But long term this ain't a coalition of the willing
She gave her ultimatum and said it was all or nothing
Respect for your position and I'm sure you wasn't bluffin
But I'm in transition, Just grabbing the rebound
Self mission, you see I made my decision
Cuz pushing a fast break could be a mistake
But see, that's Just one chance I'm'a have to take some of
Yeah, long story not so long
The plot thickened but the title suggested was all wrong
So sweetheart, heartbreaker, keep in touch, stay strong
Soon enough someone else will be singing the same song
Come on

[Chorus]
Oowee
Baby girl excuse me
Oowee
Are you single are you free?
Oowee
I'm feeling you. You feeling me?
Oowee
Well maybe this was meant to be
Oowee
Like razor sharp candy
Oowee
Your whole style so sweet and deadly
Oowee
So elegant and sexy
Oowee
I want to feel you feeling me</pre>
