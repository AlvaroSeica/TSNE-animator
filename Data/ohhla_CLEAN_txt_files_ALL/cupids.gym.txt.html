[Patrick]
(Chorus)
Take a look at my girfriend
She's the only one I got
Not much of a girlfriend
I never seem to get alot

It's been some time since we've last spoke
This is gonna sound like a bad joke
But momma I fell in love again
It's safe to say I have a new girlfriend
And I know it sounds so old
But Cupid got me in a chokehold
And I'm afraid I might give in
Towel's on the mat--my white flag is wavin'
I mean she even cooks me pancakes
And alka seltzer when my tummy aches
If that ain't love then I don't know what love is
We even got a secret handshake
And she loves the music that my band makes
I know I'm young, but if I had to choose her or the sun
I'd be one nocturnal son of a gun

[Patrick]
(Chorus x2)

It's been awhile since we talked last
And I'm tryin' hard not to talk fast
But dad I'm finally thinkin' I may have found the one
Type of girl that'll make you way proud of your son
And I know you heard the last song
About the girls that didn't last song
But I promise this is on a whole new plane
I can tell by the way she says my name
I love the way she calls my phone
She's even got her very own ringtone
If that ain't love then I don't know what love is
It's gonna be a long drive home
But I know as soon as I arrive home
And I open the door, take off my coat, and throw my bag on the floor
She'll be back into my arms once more for sure like

[Patrick]
(Chorus x2)

She's got a smile that'll make the most senile, annoying
Old man bite his tongue--I'm not done
She's got eyes comparable to sun rise
And it doesn't stop there--Man I swear
She's got porcelain skin, of course she's a ten
Now she's even got her own song, but movin on
She's got the cutest laugh I've ever heard
And we can be on the phone for three hours not sayin' one word
And I would still cherish every moment
And when I start to build my future, she's the main component
Call it dumb, call it luck, call it love
Or whatever you call it, but
Everywhere I go I keep her picture in my wallet like you

[Patrick]
(Chorus x2)</pre>
