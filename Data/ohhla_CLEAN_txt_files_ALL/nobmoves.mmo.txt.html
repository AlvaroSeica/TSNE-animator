Song:   Nobody Moves
Typed by: Cno Evil

[Chorus: Trigg-nomm]
Nobody move, think about playing it cool
Nobody move, I'm about to change the rules
Nobody move, you know the deal, nigga, Cash Rules
Nobody move, and I ain't got shit to lose

[Trigg-nomm]
Daily routine, every day scheme for C.R.E.A.M.
Typical fiends, slinging in the foulest scenes
By any means, attitude when we rule
Dudes is rude, similar to criminals Scrooge
Move thorough, type jigsaw like a puzzle
Pissing in train tunnels while scheming on your bundle
Playing the humble, huddle up, no fumbles
From child's play, to everyday foul play
Medallion Isle, where the foul, all went down
A small town, where clowns killed kings for crowns
We young cats, thinking it's fun to gun clap
We love rap, nah, dude, we don't rap
Fly villain, dipping out of dollar cabs, blunt spilling
Haters in front of villains be steady ice grilling
Knowing the dealing, still fronting with feeling
They be knowining they dealing, yet they still fronting with feeling

[Chorus]

[Trigg-nomm]
It's like a way of thinking, mostly when we out drinking
For adolescense, water weapons just testing
Learned a lesson, Brooklyn/Crooklyn's daily juxing
Wound up in Central Booking, crossfire, lives tooken
Moms in grief, major beef wit the police
Even had the man fronting out by the Himalayah
Dispicable, the way the boys in blue'll click on you
Sware your college is ugly, put a clip in you
Pistol whipping you, like the days of slaves
Resist and notice, when time is no change
Pain with no game, pre judge with no shame
So when I lose my cool, tell me who's to blame

[Chorus 2X]

[Trigg-nomm]
We goodfellas, out in Fresh Meadows, betting Monticello
Pocket sweller, type like, Rockerfeller
Name Marcellus, old time coke seller
Ring a bell? Talent gone stale, tipping triple beam scales
Service still well, slot locked for the 12's
My same gig, before he ran up in my dun crib
Illegal legacy, got the suckas pondering wit the pedigree
Snake steadily, hoping they bury me in memory
Type like Rasco, rocking rasco, back in the day
Form a daily Costco, rhymed bout apostle
Years to years change, from lots of small change
To Franklin's, Benji's, snakes envy
So now I play 'em stingy, feed 'em from a far
Switch up my repertoire
Now popular, I sky tint the car
Reportoire, fast cars and bullet scars
Trigg-nomm, legendary lyrical don

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
