[Beyoncé]
I've been drinkin, I've been drinkin
I get filthy when that liquor get into me
I've been thinkin, I've been thinkin
Why can't I keep my fingers off it baby?
I want you, nah nahhhh
Why can't I keep my fingers off it baby?
I want you, nah nahhhh

Cigars on ice, cigars on ice
Feelin like an animal with these cameras all in my grill
Flashin lights, flashin lights
You got me faded, faded, faded
Baby I want you, nah nahhhh
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty
Daddy I want you, nah nahhhh
Drunk in love, I want you

[Interlude: Beyoncé]
We woke up in the kitchen
Sayin, "How the hell did this shit happen?"
Ohh baby... drunk in loooooove
We be all night
Last thing I remember
is our beautiful bodies grindin off in that club
Drunk in loooooove

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
We be all night!
Loooooove, loooooove
We be all night!
Loooooove, loooooove

[Beyoncé]
We be all night, and everything alright
No complaints from my body so fluorescent under these lights
Boy I'm drinkin, park it in my lot 7-11
I'm rubbin on it, rub-rubbin, if you scared call that reverend
Boy I'm drinkin, get my brain right, Armand de Brignac, gangsta wife
New sheets, he sweat it out like washrags, he wear it out
Boy I'm drinkin, I'm singin, on the mic 'til my voice hoarse
Then I fill the tub up halfway then ride it with my surfboard
Surfboard... surfboard
Grainin on that wood, grainin-grainin on that wood
I'm swervin on that, swervin-swervin on that big body Benz
Servin all this, swerve, surfin all in this good good (hahaha!)

[Interlude]

[Chorus]

[Jay Z]
I'm nice right now, hold up

That D'USSÉ is the shit, if I do say so myself
If I do say so myself, if I do say so myself
Hold up, stumble all in that house, time to back up all that mouth
that you had all in the car talkin 'bout you the baddest bitch thus far
Talkin 'bout you be reppin that 3rd, I wanna see all the shit that I heard
Know I sling Clint Eastwood, hope you can handle this +Curve+
Uh, foreplay in the foyer, fucked up my Warhol
Slid the panties right to the side, ain't got the time to take drawers off
On sight... catch a charge I might
Beat the box up like Mike, in '97 I bite
I'm Ike, Turner, turn up, baby know I don't play
"Now eat the cake, Anna Mae, said eat the cake, Anna Mae!"
I'm nice... for y'all to reach these heights
You gon' need G3, 4, 5, 6 flights
Sleep tight... we sex again in the morning
Your breasteses is my breakfast, we goin in
We be all night

[Chorus]

[Beyoncé]
I'm never tired, never tired
I been sippin, that's the only thing
that's keepin me on fire, me on fire
Didn't mean to spill that liquor all on my attire
I've been drinkin, watermelon
I want your body right here
Daddy I want you, right now
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty
Daddy I want you...

[Chorus]</pre>
