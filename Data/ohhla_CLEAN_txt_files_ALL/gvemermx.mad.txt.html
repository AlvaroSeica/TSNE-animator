[Intro: LMFAO]
Pa-party rock!
Party, pa-party rock! {*2X*} Yeah

[Chorus: Madonna]
Don't play the stupid game cause I'm a different kind of girl
Every record sounds the same, you've got to step into my world
Give me all your love and give me your love
Give me all your love today
Give me all your love and give me your love
Let's forget about time, and dance our lives away

[Bridge: repeat 2X]
L-U-V, Madonna
Y-O-U, you wanna

[Madonna]
Give me all your love and give me your love
Give me all your love today
Give me all your love and give me your love
Let's forget about time, and dance our lives away

[Nicki Minaj]
Give me all your love boy
You can be my boy, you can be my boy toy
In the nick of time, I can say a sicker rhyme
Cause it's time for change, like a nickel or a dime
I'm Roman!
I'm a +Barbarian+, I'm +Conan+
You was sleepin on me, you were dozin
Now move!! I'm goin in

[LMFAO]
YO~! I'm Trojan
Pin you on the mat, Hulk Hogan
Take you to the max then go again
My slogan (I'm sexy and)
I KNOW IT! Show it
Baby girl it's yo' moment
Work it, work it, own it
Give me your love devote it all

[Chorus] breaks down into repeats of "L-U-V, Madonna; Y-O-U, you wanna"

[LMFAO]
Ho-ho-ho-ho-hold up!
Baby girl your man look to' up
You should be with me, I'm swoll up
Knock it out the park, home run
Witty +Young Money+, +I'm On One+, +A Milli+
Carve the sky, I am and know Willie
Like-like a bird, jump and I really
can't can't breathe with your love gon' kill me so

[Madonna]
Give me all your love and give me your love
Give me all your love today
Give me all your love and give me your love
Let's forget about time, and dance our lives away</pre>
