[Ke$ha]
I don't need you or your brand new Benz, or your bougie friends
I don't need love lookin like diamonds, lookin like diamonds

Get sleazy {*8X*} I'ma get
Get sleazy {*4X*} I'ma get
Get sleazy {*4X*}

[Chorus]
I don't need you or your brand new Benz, or your bougie friends
I don't need love lookin like diamonds, lookin like diamonds
I don't need you or your brand new Benz, or your bougie friends
I don't need love lookin like diamonds, lookin like diamonds

[Ke$ha]
You can't imagine the immensity of the {fuck} I'm not givin
about your money and manservant at the mansion you live in
And I don't wanna go places where all my ladies can't get in
Just rab a bottle, some boys, and let's take it back to my basement
and get sleazy, sick of all your lines, so cheesy
Sorry daddy, but I'm not that easy
I'm not gonna sit here while you circle jerk it and work it
I'a take it back to where my man and my girls is
Get sleazy {*4X*} Cause I'ma get
Get sleazy {*4X*} Cause I'ma get

[Chorus]

[Interlude: repeat 2X]
Rat-a-tat-tat on your dum-dum drum
The beat's so fat gonna make me cum/come
um, um, um, um, over to your place
Ah-ah-ah-AHH~!

[Ke$ha]
I don't mean to critique on your seduction technique
But-but your money's not impressin me, it's kinda weak
that-tha you really think you're gonna get my rocks off
Get my top and socks off, by showin me the dollars in your drop box
Me and all my friends, we don't buy bottles, we bring 'em
We take the drinks from the tables when you get up and leave 'em
And I don't care if you stare and you call us scummy
Cause we ain't after your affection and sure as hell not your money honey

[Chorus] + [Interlude]</pre>
