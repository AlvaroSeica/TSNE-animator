[Verse One: Ice-T]
Here we go, ten years ago I used to listen to rappers flow
Talking about the way they rock the mic of the disco
I liked how that shit was going down (Yeah!)
Dreamed about ripping the mic with my own sound
So I tried to write rhymes, something like them
My boys said: that ain't you Ice? - that shit sounds like them
So I sat back, thought up of new track
Didn't fantasize, kicked a pure facts
Motherfuckers got scared, cause they was unprepared
Who would tell it how it really was? - who dared?
A motherfucker from the West Coast L.A.
South Central fool, where the Crips and the Bloods play
When I wrote about parties it didn't fit
Six in the Morning - that was a real shit

O.G. Original Gangster - O.G. Original Gangster - O.G. Original Gangster
O.G. Original Gangster - O.G. Original Gangster - O.G. Original Gangster
O.G. Original Gangster - O.G. Original Gangster - O.G. Original Gangster

[Verse Two: Ice-T]
When I wrote about parties, someone always died
When I tried to write happy, yo, I knew I lied
Cause, I lived a life of crime, why play you blind?
A simple look and anyone with two cents would know I'm;
A hardcore player from the streets
Rapping about hardcore topics over hardcore drum beats
A little different than the average though
Jet you through the fast lane, drop you on death row
Cause anybody who's been there knows that
Life ain't so lovely on the blood-soaked fast track
That invincible shit don't work
I throw you in a joint, you'll be coming out feet first
So I blast the mic with my style
Sometimes I'm ill, and other times buck wild
But the science is always there
I'd be a true sucker, if I acted like I didn't care
I rap for brothers just like myself
Dazed by the game in a quest for extreme wealth
But I kick it to you hard and real
One wrong move (DAMN!!) and your caps peeled (*Gun Shot*)
I ain't no super hero, I ain't no Marvel Comic
But when it comes to game I'm atomic
At dropping it, at a straight, point blank and untwisted
No imagination needed, cause I lived it
This ain't no fucking joke, this shit is real to me
I'm Ice-T, O.G.

[Interlude: DJ Evil E]
YEAAAAHHHHHH!! COME ON!! PUMP IT UP!!
JUMP!! JUMP!! JUMP!! JUMP!! JUMP!! JUMP!! JUMP!!
JUMP!! JUMP!! JUMP!! JUMP!! JUMP!! JUMP!! JUMP!!
JUMP!! JUMP!! JUMP!! JUMP!! JUMP!! JUMP!! JUMP!!
Hit them with it!

[Verse Three: Ice-T]
Hustler, word, I pull the trigger long
Grit my teeth, spray 'til every nigga's gone
Got my block sewn, armored dope spots
Last thing I sweat's a sucker punk cop
Move like a king when I roll hops
You try to flex (BANG!!) another nigga drops
You gotta deal with this cause there's no way out (Why?)
Cash money ain't never gonna play out
I got nothing to lose, much to gain
In my brain, I got a capitalist migraine
I gotta get paid tonight, you're motherfucking right
Think of my grip, check my bitch, keep my game tight
So many whores on my jock, think I'm a movie star
In nineteen, got a fifty thousand dollar car
Go to school, I ain't going for it
Kiss my ass, bust the cap on the MoÃ«t
Cause I don't wanna hear that crap (WHY?!!)
I'd rather be a New Jack Hustler!

[Break #3: Ice-T]
Now, we got any hustlers in the house?
Say YEAH!! (YEAH!!) Say HELL YEAH!! (HELL YEAH!!)
Say HELL MOTHERFUCKING YEAH!! (HELL MOTHERFUCKING YEAH!!)
YEAH!! now SCREAM, scream
Switzerland is in the house

[Interlude: DJ Evil E]
Yo Ice man, I like the way you just got it down
You got the fliest girl, the jewels, look at that ring right there
I know that's real, it's gotta be real
Yo man, you're the fliest nigga I done seen in my life, man!
I don't understand this, School Rules in the house, Jazzmatazz
Yo Berg, yo bust this, hell can I be down?

[Verse Four: Ice-T]
What's up? ~ You say you wanna be down?
Ease back, or motherfucker get beat down
Out my face, fool, I'm the illest
Bulletproof, I die harder than Bruce Willis
Got my crew in effect, that I bought them new Jags
So much cash, gotta keep it in Hefty bags
All I think about is cheese and Gs
Imagine that, me working at Mickey D's (ha ha ha ha)
That's a joke cause I'm never gonna be broke
When I die, there'll be bullets and gunsmoke
You don't like my lifestyle? (FUCK YOU!)
I'm rolling with the New Jack crew

[Break #4: Trigger Tha Gambler]
Colors!! Colors!! Colors!! Colors!!
Colors!! Colors!! Colors!! Colors!!

[Verse Five: Ice-T]
I am a nightmare walking, psychopath talking
King of my jungle, just a gangster stalking
Living life like a firecracker, quick is my fuse
Then dead as a death-pack, the colors I choose
Red or Blue, Cuz or Blood, it just don't matter
Sucker dies for your life when my shotgun scatters (Colors!)
The gangs of L.A. will never die (WHY? WHY? WHY?)
Just multiply, Colors!

[Break #5: Ice-T]
WAVE YOUR HANDS IN THE AIR!!
AND WAVE THEM LIKE YOU JUST DON'T CARE!!
Say YEAH!! (YEAH!!) Say HELL YEAH!! (HELL YEAH!!)
Say HELL MOTHERFUCKING YEAH!! (HELL MOTHERFUCKING YEAH!!)
Yeah, Montreux's in the house, UHH!!

[Verse Six: Ice-T]
You don't know me (Fool) you disown me (Cool)
I don't need your assistance, social persistence
Any problem I got, I just stick my fist in
My life is violent, but violent is life
Peace is a dream, reality is a knife
My color is my honor, my color is my all
With my colors upon me, one soldier stands tall
Tell me; what have you left me? - what have I got?
Last night in cold blood, my young brother got shot
My home got jacked, my mother is on crack
My sister can't work, cause her arms show tracks
Madness, insanity, live in profanity
Then some punk claiming; you're understanding me
Give me a break; what world do you live in?
Death is my sect, guess my religion!

[Break #6: DJ Evil E]
Colors!! Colors!! Colors!! Colors!!
Colors!! Colors!! Colors!! Colors!!
Switzerland's in the house, YEAAAHHH!!
SOMEBODY SCREAM!! - SCREAM!! - SCREAM!!
Yo, Syndicate fool!

[Verse Seven: Ice-T]
My pants are sagging, braided hair
Suckers stare, but I don't care
My game ain't knowledge, my game's fear
I've no remorse, so squares beware
But my true mission, is just revenge
You ain't in my sect, you ain't my friend
Wear the wrong color your life could end
Homicides my favorite avenge

[Break #7: Trigger Tha Gambler]
Colors!! Colors!! Colors!! Colors!!
Oh! SHIT! yo, what the fuck is this shit?
Colors!! Colors!! Colors!! Colors!!
What is this shit?
Yo, Switzerland are you there?
SCREAM!! - SCREAM!! - SCREAM!!
Yo, Syndicate is in this motherfucker, Syndicate fool!

[Verse Eight: Ice-T]
I just walk like a giant, the police defiant
You'll say to stop, but I'll say that I can't
My gang's my family, y'all it that I have
I'm a star, on the wall is my autograph
You don't like it, so you know where you can go
Cause the streets are my stage, and terror's my show
Psychoanalyze tried, diagnosing me wise
It wasn't your brother, that brutally died
But it was mine, so let me define
My territory; don't cross the line
Don't try to act crazy, cause the shit don't faze me
If you ran like a punk, it wouldn't amaze me
Cause my color is death, though we're all want peace
But our war won't end, til the all world decease

* Crowd went nuts and gave up a great round of applause</pre>
