[Intro: Free Murda]
Yeah, uh-huh, yea
Brooklyn, Fort Greene
Division, check.. check..
What? Huh.. Division

[Chorus: Free Murda]
No, ya'll ain't never gon' take this money
Ya'll ain't never gon' take this from me
Tuck in my waist, you can make shit ugly
Pop in ya face, if you think shit funny
Ya'll ain't never gon' take this money
Ya'll ain't never gon' take this from me
Broads they like, on sight
Or we can get it on tonight

[Free Murda]
The thing to your mouth, you can't risk, can't flip
Tried to get me canned like Manwich
You ain't gotta leave, but you gotta get out of 'here' like dandruff
Fuck around and get that little head all bandaged
The fuck off, once I drive the truck, up the ave.
Buck off your cast, now you can't move
Stucked up the ave., didn't tell ya mans move
Bust off that cash, then moved to Cancun
I want that whole ave., give this man room
Get into you get something you can't do
Get you out of here, then we out of here, breeze off
In that Roc-A-Wear valor, pop ya hair, for sure
Laying in the dirt, be getting a lot of fans on tour
My niggas take blaze, because the PJ's taught
Clap a nigga, he gon' 'play the station' like EA sports
It ain't a game, yo, how I just let that thang go

[Chorus]

[Free Murda]
Why that nigga Tone, watching 106 &amp; Park
I'm on the block, til it turn 106 in the park
I'm out in my 1-06, that's parked
On Park Ave., smoking one whole spliff that's charmed
One whole clip that bark is all I need
And a nigga like Free, quick to lay you with chalk
My whole click got c-notes that they can lay in
Free ain't Benzino, but he 'made men'
I have nigga round ya way with macks, boy
I have you surrounded with chalk like black boards
My niggas clap, not on them back boards
Roll up like the Texans, in black Fords
Gats towards ya Honda Accord
Ya'll can't act hard til them wheels fast forward
Right up on ya, light up corners
Police get 'em right up of us

[Chorus]

[Free Murda]
Five hundred mill or better, dog, now that's money
Roll in a five hundred, ya'll, now that's ugly
Better ask money, flip shit, they gon' act funny
My watcher baby get that cash money
Since a juvenile, strapped with 21 niggas
Never took that gat from me, what?
As far as I can see, niggas don't want that fast money
Don't wanna be looking over the shoulders with the fast, money
Better dash, money, if ya bitch wanna talk
Shut her lips, before I blast honey
Division, we get dollars, blowing white Impala
Roll up on her, trick, they get nada
Talking all that shit, we gon' holla
If it don't mean flizz, then why bother
All that illing, like fast food, they getting took out
Doing all this grilling, it ain't even a cook out

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
