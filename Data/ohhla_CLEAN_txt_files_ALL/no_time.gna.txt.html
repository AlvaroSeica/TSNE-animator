[Cee-Lo]
This could beeeeee one of those dayyyyyys
When we must gooooo our separate wayyyyyys
Scared for you to be out of my siiiiiight
Cause you never know, you miiiiiight

[Chorus]
And I carry this, it's heavyyyyyyy~!
And I miss you, alreadyyyyyyyy~!
You were perfect babe

[Cee-Lo]
My time will come, yours tooooooo
I'd gladly go before youuuuuuu
I hope you never everrrrrrr
Oh baby we can go togetherrrrrr
Ahhh ahhh ahhhhhh
It'll be perfect babe

[Chorus]

[Cee-Lo]
Perfect</pre>
