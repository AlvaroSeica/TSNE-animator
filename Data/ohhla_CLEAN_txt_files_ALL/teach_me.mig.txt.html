Song:   Teach Me
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I just want to be wherever you are
I just want to know your there
I just want to see whatever you see
Cause I know you're not too shy to say it

[Hook]
Cause everywhere I go and everyone I touch
What I already know is not enough
And no one has taught me quite like you
Following my eyes searching for the real knowing that there's not much else
Tell me that you hear what I'm saying,
Ooh I swear you know the very best way to...

[Chorus]
Teach me, train me, guide me baby (ooh)
Only you can release the love inside me baby (waited my turn and I'm ready to learn)
Teach me, train me, guide me baby (ooh)
Release the love inside me baby (ooh)
In and out love me down playing with my dirty mind

I just want to feel whatever you feel
Feel it at the very same time (yeaah)
I want to know how to make you cry
How to make your body cream
Feel my dirty mind with your favorite erotic dream
Oooh show me what to do

[Hook]
Cause everywhere I go and everyone I touch
What I already know is not enough
And no one has taught me quite like you
Following my eyes searching for the real
Knowing that it's not much else,
Tell me that you hear what I'm saying,
Ooh I swear you know the very best way to

[Chorus]
Teach me, train me, guide me baby
Only you can release the love inside me baby (ooh waited my turn and I'm ready to learn)
Teach me, train me, guide me baby (oooh only you can)
Release the love inside me baby
In and out love me down playing with my dirty mind

[Hook 2]
Anywhere we are I'm daring you to demonstrate
The front seat in my car close your eyes and accelerate
If you never seen this side of me take a ride on my rocket babe
Your body is a party and I just want to celebrate
[Repeat 4x]

[Chorus]
Teach me, train me, guide me baby
Release the love inside me baby
Teach me, train me, guide me baby
Release the love inside me baby
[Repeat 2x]</pre>
