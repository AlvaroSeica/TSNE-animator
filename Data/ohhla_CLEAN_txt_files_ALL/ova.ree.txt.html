[Chorus: Freddie Gibbs]
Ain't no play
These fake ass niggaz, O.V.A
Ain't no play
These snake ass niggaz, O.V.A
Ain't no play
These bitch ass niggaz, O.V.A
Ain't no play
These bitch ass niggaz, O.V.A
Ain't no play
These fake ass niggaz, O.V.A
Ain't no play
These snake ass niggaz, O.V.A
Ain't no play
Bitch ass niggaz, O.V.A
Ain't no play
These snitch ass niggaz O.V.A

[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
Nigga ain't no play
These snitch ass niggaz, O.V.A
Had to close up shop
Niggaz hold all the rocks, done for the day
And I'm a hundred round drum
AK-47 right around that bay
Young nigga on the come up
I'm gonna try to fuck 100, 000 hoes this summer
Fuck with me and I dumps nigga
Make a move and get moved on
Pushin' packs to my young niggaz
Serving dope in your school zone
I need some zone in that backpack
The 38's and 9's, we got that
I'm gonna take my lil' niggaz on field trips
We straight kill shit
Where them sacks at, bitch
Cus' it's ova'
Getting road head in a rover
Chevy thang' got a new motor
Fucking with the cane and the soda
Got that yoda
And it's ova'
Whole things and the quotas
Real ass nigga I told ya
Fucking with the cane and the soda
Got that yoda

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Lil Reese]
Ain't no play
These fake ass niggaz be all in your face
And I ain't gon' play
Keep that thing on my waist
So you know I'm gon' spray
30 in the space
Take his ass to the crib, make him find that safe
And I beat that case
Stay rolling up loud, to the face
My mouth duck taped
These snake ass niggaz be talking to the tapes
And it's O.V.A
By all means I gotta get that cake
I don't fuck with the fake
And I party with the 8
Keep the squares out the shake
My block move yay
My name, ho wait
It's O.V.A
Get them going by the day
Keep the squares out the shake
Louis V on my waist
That's to hold my waist
That's to hold my waist
It's O.V.A

[Chorus]</pre>
