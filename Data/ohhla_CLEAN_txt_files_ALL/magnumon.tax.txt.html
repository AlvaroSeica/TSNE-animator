Ahhhh yeahhhh, hocus pocus
Open sesame... Abra Kadabra... And all that shit

[Verse 1]
You know we got to put a lead in it
Braintax putting Leeds in it
Made another album and it sounds so good
C.E. coming through like you wishing you could
And I'm the game keeper leading you all through the woods
All good? Nah I'm better than that
You can't figure my rap, you figure me out - and then you might figure to clap
Understand what I'm saying from the start
And if you do not know what I'm saying, start again from the start
I remain, dont forget it
I wrote it, you read it
Emcees are off the hook - no credit
Call a medic (huuuuuh!)
I got that Northern tinge
I used to rep the underground but nowadays it's fringe
Wait I'm jokin! Now Colin put the lead in
Braintax in the booth definitely weeding (da dit.. da dit dit...)

[Chorus]
It goes last is best, and my best is last
So I quit while I'm ahead, now consider me the past
See finishing ahead has got style and grace
I got accolades for ("Mic brains... check
Check? What the heck are you talking about?")

[Verse 2]
And yeah we had to put the funk in it, the most necessary additive
Money motivates, proving points is the catalyst (Joey!)
Mr Brains with Emmanuel, came with more than beats and loops
Like ?? and Miralles taking over modern guns and booths
Winning hearts with my ideas and I'm staying aloof
I can't be bothered with some paranoid petty squabbles
Why do you think I even care though? The mind boggles
The new, the new 20, yeah it's true
Didn't feel like an adult 'til I hit 32
So play catch up, I watch the markets, seen the dollar slide
You better change up your change, it's so 005!
I'm so 008 or is it 009
They say don't say the years, that's how you transcend time
I transcend mind by making classic shit
Heads keep asking for the HITS like passifists
What the fuck am I then, asterix!?
Popeye on the track with a tin of spinage 
Magnum on crack, Lewis Hamilton on speed to the finish? ha
I play no brains, I set minds free
Freebanging albums remind me

[Scratches/Samples from Biro Funk] {Colin Emmanuel on the decks}
"It's like a long walk to China tryna reach these heads"..

[Chorus]
It goes last is best, and my best is last
So I quit while I'm ahead, now consider me the past
See finishing ahead has got style and grace
I got accolades for days, fuck collapsing in the race
It goes last is best, and my best is last
So I quit while I'm ahead, now consider me the past
See finishing ahead has got style and grace
I got accolades for days, fuck collapsing in the race</pre>
