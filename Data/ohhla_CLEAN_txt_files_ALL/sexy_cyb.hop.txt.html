Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
Cyber, sexy cyber, sexy cyber, I love her
Sexy cyber, sexy cyber, she's my sexy cyber girl
Cyber, sexy cyber, sexy cyber, I love her
Sexy cyber, sexy cyber, she's my sexy cyber girl

[Hopsin]
Can you believe it, she's finally about to meet her soulmate
It's still trippin her out, she's like no way
No more sad lonely nights of straight horror
Tomorrow she's meetin the lover god made for her
She's lookin in the mirror dancin around the house
With a mess of clothes on the bed tryin on outfits
She's actin out how the day is probably gonna be
Like "Hi Pete I'm so glad we finally get to meet"
She thinks to herself, hmm I know what I should do
I'ma call Nicole up and tell her all the good news
It went to voice mail cause Nicole was sleeping
So Lauren left a message, like girl I'm gonna see him
She hangs up and falls back on the bed smiling
Lookin at the ceiling, daydreamin in dead silence
Eventually her daydreamin turns into sleep
It's love that she's feelin and yes the feelin is sweet

[Chorus]

[Hopsin]
It already hit mornin oh darn
But Lauren so excited she wakes up before the alarm,
And calls Pete, to see exactly where there gonna meet
Then Pete picks up and tries to act like he wasn't sleepin
Lauren's like so where we meetin at, we could try my place
Pete's like nah how about TGI Fridays
I really love you Lauren and I know you trust me
but it's our first time meetin I don't wanna rush things
She says that's fine I'll see you at twelve
Until then I love you baby hope you'll be doin well
She takes a shower, does her hair and all that girl stuff
Make-up, lip stick, neck and wrist pearled up
Now it's about time she heads on out to tease
She text messages Pete, hey I'm about to leave
And she's so damn excited as her heart pounds beats
that she almost left her house without her keys, geez

[Chorus]

[Hopsin]
She pulls up but Pete hasn't arrived yet
Should she go in without him, she hasn't decided
She doesn't really know how he would act if she tried it
So she just sits back and just relaxes her eyelids
Its 12:20 Lauren picks up an appetite
She decides to go inside without him and have a bite
Then the phone rings, it's Pete so she answers it
Pete says baby I'm gonna have to cancel it
Lauren says why, what happened, what is it, then
Pete says I just heard my grandmother's real sick
and I have to go and give her a visit
Then Lauren says it's okay baby, go handle your business
She loves him too much so it didn't really bother her
She hops in the car pulls off
A truck follows her but she don't even notice cause her music's too loud
And she just caught up in the zone of a Ludacris album
Now she's home, she opens the door, moves to get out
Soon as the foot hits the ground, a man rushes up and pushes her down
She drops her keys, the man picks 'em up
then drags her by her feet into her house like he don't give a fuck
He slapped her, then put tape on her mouth
to take from the sound of Lauren screamin rape really loud
He's goin ballistic, her face is covered with lipstick
Then he yells out bitch Pete never existed
Her head's spinning, then she just faints
The man rips off her clothes and Lauren gets raped
From that day on nobody ever heard from her
cause that so-called Pete guy went and murdered her
He tossed her body in a off-road ditch
and said to her "See you at the crossroad bitch"
