Uh
Ay T I see you nigga
look

[Streetz]
I'm young, wild &amp; reckless, Got a bad chick in Texas
All she listen to is Bun &amp; Pimp, Old School Flexin'
Man these niggas playing catch up, I don't never let up
My system on zombie, I swear I would be dead up
Look at me now, Chris Brown
Was nobody there but I swear I'm the shit now
This is for my cousin down in Little Rock
They sold a little weed, they sold a little rock
They was leaning forward with mainstream
They saying, "Marky keep rappin' &amp; keep ya hands clean
One time for that real shit
Treat a nigga like family &amp; they still switch, fuck it
Aye look the grass got greener
My daughter got older &amp; my flow got meaner
You looking for ya girl I aint seen her
If she say she don't love me, on yo mama don't believe her
I be spittin' Daffy Duck
I be winning, I be winning, it aint luck, niggas suck
Yeah bitch I'm on my high horse
I never snitch I rather die first, EMP Gang

[Chorus]
Player till I Die, You know how I roll
Baby Losing aint an option, if you playing with a goal
Niggas out here faking' moves, but I play it how it goes
Yeah I'm smoking' &amp; I'm drinking, but I swear I'm in control (Hold up)
Aye, I do it just like that, do it just like that, do it just like that
Tell her, come here bust it open, den she gone do it
Just like that, do it just like that , do it just like that

[Young Deuces]
Right now I be feeling like we the greatest, also the most hated
And these lame niggas hating, wishing we won't make it
I flow HBO specials, you niggas still spittin basic
When the bass hit, I need everybody to fuckin crank it
This that wicked Midwest Flow, yiggy, yiggy, yes hoe
Expensive jeans, V-neck, I'm still friggy fresh though
Wrote this on a short bus, that mean my flow special
Don't bring yo girl around me, cause I'm a hoe clepto
Higher than I ever been, drunker than I ever thought
I live the life of an out of control fucking boss
I told lil' mama what you want baby fuck the cost
That boy so sick you hear the phlegm all in my cough
I look like royalty, King shit, Totally
Wordplay lava bound, other words I boil beats
Crazy lil nigga, I'm the leader of the orderlies
Ya girl just sucked me dry &amp; I aint speaking metaphorically

[Chorus]
Player till I Die, You know how I roll
Baby Losing aint an option, if you playing with a goal
Niggas out here faking' moves, but I play it how it goes
Yeah I'm smoking' &amp; I'm drinking, but I swear I'm in control (Hold up)
Aye, I do it just like that, do it just like that, do it just like that
Tell her, come here bust it open, den she gone do it
Just like that, do it just like that, do it just like that</pre>
