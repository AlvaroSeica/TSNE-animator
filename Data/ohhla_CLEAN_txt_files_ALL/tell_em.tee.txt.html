[Intro]
Ay, ay, ay, ay
For as long as I remember I been tellin y'all man
to pull these niggaz résumé (ay, ay, ay, ay)
You better check up on these niggaz
These niggaz be lyin man
These niggaz ain't really kickin this shit they be tellin y'all man
They wanna see y'all get fucked up out there man
Man keep your eyes on me nigga
Don't believe what these niggaz tell you man
I'm tryin to tell ya partner!
 
[Chorus]
These niggaz ain't cool, what they rap about these niggaz ain't do
Hear 'em say it but it really ain't true
You niggaz ain't true, you niggaz ain't really totin tools
Don't be no fool, you better take yo' ass to school
Cause these niggaz ain't G, gangsta's somethin these niggaz can't be
What you expect? These niggaz ain't me
You niggaz ain't rich, you niggaz ain't really gettin bricks
It's official man, you niggaz ain't shit
Tell 'em I said that
 
[T.I.]
These niggaz lyin e'ry time you hear 'em rhymin
Hear 'em talkin 'bout they diamonds and how they be out there shinin
'Fore the rappin, hey what trappin, tell y'all they be out there grindin
I know they ain't 'bout that action, I'm tellin y'all I'm around 'em
They probably tried to come in the hood and sell weed
Think it's all good 'til they run into some real G's
Holla, tell us where it is and I promise we'll leave
Hesitate to say and boy them lawmen will squeeze
Please, pay attention to this part of the book
One time, got robbed, got shot, got shook
Got a job, start rhymin, came up with a hook
Got a chain and some tats, came up with a look
Went and made a hit record, talk tough in the book
Fuck the image and perception, they never tough as they look
They some motherfuckin suckas, put it on whatever
Any real nigga know better, man
 
[Chorus]
 
[T.I.]
You can't tell, them niggaz ain't shell
You get caught, bet them niggaz gon' tell
Them niggaz don't sell the shit you ain't gotta put up on a scale
He ask you if it weigh enough, just tell him yeah
You niggaz just yell, pull a pistol the nigga gon' bail
If he got a pistol bet he don't spray it, he don't wanna go to jail
And then he'll know he'll be walkin on shells
It's a gladiator school, is you prepared?
I can see these niggaz scared, got a problem with me nigga just say it
We can play it how you wanna play it
Better go 'head 'fore that pistol be aimed at yo' head
All the way down here where you gon' lay
You ain't really on the edge, you ain't under suspicion of the Feds
You just tellin them you is instead
You ain't never bust heads but you get behind the mic and just say it
The people oughta know I +MUST+ say it, man
 
[Chorus]
 
[T.I.]
You damn right, you niggaz don't have rights
to rap about the shit I did e'ry night
Did you win e'ry fight? You ever went to jail for sellin white?
Made bond, back in the trap the same night?
You know these niggaz lame, right?
I'm speakin on it cause it ain't right
Niggaz died, I survived, I done earned my stripes
Went to jail, came home, between the time got it right
I'm still tryin to keep from shootin sucka niggaz I don't like
Cause the game feel like the real niggaz on strike
This sucker get a deal, now he livin so sheist
These niggaz outta sight, actin hard, lyin on they record
You know it when you see it, recognize it, don't respect it
Got e'ry right to check 'em when you see 'em in your city
Run up on 'em and try 'em, bet your city they some bitches
Niggaz tell you what they want you to hear, don't tell me
Real recognize real, eventually they'll see
 
[Chorus]
 
Ay, ay, ay</pre>
