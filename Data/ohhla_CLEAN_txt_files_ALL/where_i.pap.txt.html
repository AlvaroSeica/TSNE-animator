[Intro: Papoose]
What y'all thought y'all was safe!!!
Y'all thought y'all wasn't gonna hear my niggas on The Nacirema Dream!!!
Thuga to the death of me! Or should I say to the death of you!
Thuga!!!!

[Chorus: Papoose]
Where I come from, a closed mouth don't get fed
Where I come from, young boys respect old heads
Where I come from, you shut up when you get arrested
And gangstas speak face to face fuck a text message
Where you come from, y'all disrespect OG's
Where you come from, y'all talk to the police
Where you come from, niggas never get it shakin
Y'all be internet killin, iphone bangin

[Verse One: Dada Stone]
I got the Louis on my feet two swag belt L.V.
Get your camera, I stay picture perfect no I.G.
Who got that green swag Dada nigga, that's me
Heart of a stone, throw up the rock, Jay-Z
You stay around pussy, your whole squad coochie
I stay around G's, my whole squad Gucci
Thuga Thuga, and Dada Stone motherfucker!
Nigga never had to red ball me, word to my mother!

[Verse Two: Odog]
Uh! I spit that fire like I'm propane, nigga call me cocaine
Now I'm in the dope game, use to rock a rope chain
Thuga to the death of me, whole team strike back
Pap already warned y'all, homey you ain't like that
Real recognize real, we don't complain
Niggas slick talk, end it with his slug in his crane
We run down on 'em, gun down on 'em
Play on these niggas from sun up to sun down on 'em

[Chorus: Papoose]
Where I come from, a closed mouth don't get fed
Where I come from, young boys respect old heads
Where I come from, you shut up when you get arrested
And gangstas speak face to face fuck a text message
Where you come from, y'all disrespect OG's
Where you come from, y'all talk to the police
Where you come from, niggas never get it shakin
Y'all be internet killin, iphone bangin

[Verse Three: Manson]
Rap said don't spend it unless you got it in the stash
O said you want it cop it, fuck if it's yo' last  
Pap said, it's yo' turn O, get up in they ass
You got style, charisma, now give 'em some pizzazz  
180 on the dash you can't ride like me
I did this my whole life O.D. O.G.!!!
I'm a side block nigga, I get respect in the P's
Flyin overseas just for me to play on jet ski's

[Verse Four: Kino]
My pops told me put yo' team on everything
Prepare 'em well make sure they ready for everything
I give my word hands down no funny dreams
Whatever come we get it done by any means
In here I feel it I'm just waitin
And money make me nervous my hands shakin
I said yeah I feel it them niggas hatin
But I don't fear niggas my family is Thugacation

[Chorus: Papoose]
Where I come from, a closed mouth don't get fed
Where I come from, young boys respect old heads
Where I come from, you shut up when you get arrested
And gangstas speak face to face fuck a text message
Where you come from, y'all disrespect OG's
Where you come from, y'all talk to the police
Where you come from, niggas never get it shakin
Y'all be internet killin, iphone bangin

[Verse Five: C-Brown]
Knock cats I'm T-Mac on the grind
It's like, catchin ruler divine eatin the swine
I was born to be a mack call me T-Mack divine
Light the state up everyday I go grind, so everyday I'm a shine
I'm Thugacated, so you don't want no problems homes
Red ice in the chains call it Dada Stone
I'm with them stick up kids that stay schemin
It's Pap and Thugacation we just Nacirema dreamin

[Verse Six: ?]
Aiyyo your flow is wack, stale and slippin better spit it well and gifted
Violator I'll lay you down, quicker than a trailor visit
Hella digits any body get it I'll finish your blood
I run through a sea like a sailor mission
Your work is garbage that's the reason why your boys struggle
Train you with lyrics we teach in the hood, like Floyd's uncle
Runnin for cover when the ratchet ring
I'll have your faggot team strippin like a model in a magazine

[Chorus: Papoose]
Where I come from, a closed mouth don't get fed
Where I come from, young boys respect old heads
Where I come from, you shut up when you get arrested
And gangstas speak face to face fuck a text message
Where you come from, y'all disrespect OG's
Where you come from, y'all talk to the police
Where you come from, niggas never get it shakin
Y'all be internet killin, iphone bangin
