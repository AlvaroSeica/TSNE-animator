[Lupe Fiasco]
Yeah, just a little bit, just a little bit
And it goes..
Lifestyles of the rich and famous
Bought a big house and a whole lot of Ranges
A fresh new couch and a whole lot of trainers
A closet full of clothes and some brand new dangers
And, some Mexican floral arrangers
A great big TV that'll entertain us
Some colorful commissions for some high-paid painters
Someone to take the wrap so that I stay stainless
And, a new relationship with a banker
Two pinky rings for my manicured fingers
A trained German Shepherd that bark when it's angered
to watch my possessions and look out for strangers
And, a fifty-foot yacht with an anchor
A young supermodel that shall remain nameless
Ups and the downs, the sames and the changes
All the money in the world don't make it painless, no

[Chorus: Lupe Fiasco] + (Thom Yorke "The Eraser" sample)
But they love it and they love it
("The more you try to erase me, the more..")
And they love it, and they love it
And they love it, and they love it
("The more that I appear, oh the more..")
And they love it, and they love it
And they love it, and they love it
("The more you try the eraser, the more..")
And they love it, and they love it
And they love it, and they love it
("The more that you appear")

[Kanye West]
Plain Pat what up? Uh, uh
Lifestyles of the broke and famous
Let you know how crazy this game is
Look at all the new beautiful faces
At-home supermodel, MySpaces
Long for they shot on the TV screen
Amercian Idol never seen these dreams
Just last week they want to see I.D.
Now they got you in V.I.P., huh?
How many people almost famous?
You almost remember what they name is
Like "Hey, didn't you play in..?"
"No it couldn't be, quit playing"
I try to keep that balance
After MTV, that's a Real World Challenge
Back on that train
Never to be heard from again

[Chorus]

[Pharrell]
G-R-I-P P-I-M-P
I, any spelling bitch, come on that's me
I bring a burning sensation to the urban eye
like an eye-drop of turpentine
You can listen to the serpent, fine
But the earth's got gas, once it burps, it's fine
Some around me, they talk about degrees
Not G.H.G., how to cook a quarter key
Talking all nasal, he ain't never over that cold
No glove, scrubs, man he just over that stove
Perfect paradigm, wrong place, wrong time
Should have been Pfizer, GlaxoSmithKline
Number one chemist, look at him, no blemish
Egg shell off-white like a DuPont finish
Young, dumb, high-strung, who could handle us?
I wonder how god's gon' paint today's canvases
Cause who knew that day that man would just
go to V.A. with a TEC and spray campuses
What a way to see the cover of Time
I know that nigga wish he was standing in line
to see it.. as if he didn't do it
