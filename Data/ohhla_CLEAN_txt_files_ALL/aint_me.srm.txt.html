[Intro: Erick Sermon]
Check one, two, ummm...yeah...huh...yeah..huh
Yeah! Long Island! Huh! Listen!

[Verse One: Erick Sermon]
Yeah! I be gettin looks and such when I be walkin
Able to bag any chick, when I start talkin
Even white boys be sayin yo E's awesome
Yeah I got jewels but no need to floss 'em
And I got friends got no need to cross 'em
Or Rick Ross 'em that means to boss 'em
I love the world so I take flights often
And I'm goin anywhere don't matter what the cost and...
My life's a movie, you tryin to make one (HUH!)
Up in the club with Bus shootin the fake one
No director, but you got extras
Chick define textures, all up in your sectors
'Cause sure you ain't fly, but that's what I be lookin at
My boy was in the spot, where your chain got tooken at
Live from the streets ain't no need to C-Span
The most respected, remember you ain't me man

[Chorus: Erick Sermon] (Sample from "Don't Look Any Further")
When I walk in the place they like (OH!) Flash my cash the girls be like (AHHHHH!!!!)
'Cause I be doin it (WELL! WELL! WELL! WELL! WELL!)
I'm a tell you one time, remember you ain't me man
'Cause you don't cash them checks, you can't look this fresh
Mostly in 550 you don't fly this jet
E'vrything brand new you ain't seen this yet
I'm a say it one time, remember you ain't me man

[Verse Two: Erick Sermon]
I'm on top of the game no tops on the car
Low top Louis untied no socks
On top of your bitch, she holla off top
Dope top of the line see the shine on the top
Hundred chickens in the kitchen I'm addicted to the (Smell!)
Every hundred thousand digits boy stop it (Inhale!)
Big Coupes in the front (Front!) The boats in the back (Back)
Pool on the roof (What!) Smokin anthrax 
Money don't stop (Stop!) Gunners on lock (Lock!)
The range for the cops so your woman gettin shot (OWWWWW!!!!)
Nobody move and nobody gettin murdered
I talk big money 'cause that boy gettin word
Money come in bags (Bags!) Count it on the floor
'Til we take it to the club and we pourin on a hoe
And they bring it back to me they know that daddy love his dough
Get the powder up their nose they know that daddy got a load

[Chorus: Erick Sermon] (Sample from "Don't Look Any Further" by Dennis Edwards &amp; Siedah Garrett)
When I walk in the place they like (OH!) Flash my cash the girls be like (AHHHHH!!!!)
'Cause I be doin it (WELL! WELL! WELL! WELL! WELL!)
I'm a tell you one time, remember you ain't me man
'Cause you don't cash them checks, you can't look this fresh
Mostly in 550 you don't fly this jet
E'vrything brand new you ain't seen this yet
I'm a say it one time, remember you ain't me man

[Verse Three: Erick Sermon]:
Enough with that now, back to the feature
No campaign or change for this speaker
Yes I can I'm a do it 'til I'm older
Somewhere around 50, MJ or Oprah
Russell Simmons, Madonna, Chuck D or Bono
Fly motherfucker and they don't ask condos
Somewhere up in midtown, up in Times Square
When nobody around but me and that there (HUH!)
It could be a maid (Yeah!) It could be a butler (YES!)
It could be a chick (HUH!) She could be a hustler
I'm somethin like Larry, Flint but tougher
No wheelchair, it's a Leer Jet plusher
All haters suffer, that's me sayin that 
Don't make a mistake man 'cause I ain't okayin that
Way before Wayne you could bet, I was stayin strapped
Now I'm up in Ceaser, craps where I'm playin at

[Chorus: Erick Sermon] (Sample from "Don't Look Any Further" by Dennis Edwards &amp; Siedah Garrett)
When I walk in the place they like (OH!) Flash my cash the girls be like (AHHHHH!!!!)
'Cause I be doin it (WELL! WELL! WELL! WELL! WELL!)
I'm a tell you one time, remember you ain't me man
'Cause you don't cash them checks, you can't look this fresh
Mostly in 550 you don't fly this jet
E'vrything brand new you ain't seen this yet
I'm a say it one time, remember you ain't me man</pre>
