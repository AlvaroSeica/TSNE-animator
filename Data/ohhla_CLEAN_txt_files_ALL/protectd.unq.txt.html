Yo
Wake up

This is protected by the red
The black
And the green

Sissyyyy

[ PRELUDE: Unique ]
Honor the speaker, for his wisdom is intelligent
And I'm not altered by negativity cause it's irrelevant
Instead I'd rather wipe the whole slate clean
Cause I'm connected and protected by the red, black and green

(Keep on pushin)
(Lord have mercy, we're movin on up)
(Keep on pushin)  --&gt; Curtis Mayfield

[ VERSE 1: Unique ]
My object is to make sure that all minds are free
And to bring vision into the eyes of those who cannot see
So listen close to every word cause this is for your own good
I break it down as simply as possible so that understanding is understood
I know half of you don't wanna hear it but I'll say it anyway
Because the truth ( ? ) the proof and it is here to stay
Now our people are bein destroyed all across this land
But you wouldn't know that it was a part of the government's plan
Some people live in poverty while others are livin in wealth
How could we think about helpin South Africa when we can't even help ourselves?
'USA for Africa' - somebody out there lied
Cause major companies in this country still support apartheid
So don't take things at face value, confirm them first
Cause what you think is the best, it might just be the worst
Like for instance crack is takin over everyone
That tried it once and now they addicted cause they thought it was fun
But if you dig a little deeper you will find out more
Vanglorious will teach you, that's what we're here for
But I will never get trapped in a negative realm if you know what I mean
Cause I'm protected by the red, black and green

(Keep on pushin)
(Lord have mercy, we're movin on up)
(Keep on pushin)

[ VERSE 2: Unique ]
Accept the knowledge or reject it cause it will be there still
This isn't a fairytale cause I ain't a joke and this here is for real
So if you listen real closely to the science I'm droppin I'm sure you will see
Why I come with the holy attribute of the Great Unique
The negativity won't survive the realm of righteousness
Cause I will build it, also destroy the bad and then save the rest
Many are called but few'll be chosen of the ones on the shelf
And the only ones who will be chosen are those who choose themself
Because anybody can make a record, but who will tell the truth?
MC Unique is in the flesh and he is livin proof
There's no conspiracy to the words that I speak
You never try to dis cause you really weak, I'm on my peak
( ? ) seek, you know you can't hang with the Great Unique
( ? ) this reality ( ? ) was livin it
You think about bringin any harm but ( ? ) flippin
Marcus Garvey was a leader like Malcolm and King
Cause we're protected by the red, black and green
