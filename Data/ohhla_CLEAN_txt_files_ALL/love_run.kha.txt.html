Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Hey, Hey, Hey
Hey, ohh

HoustatlantaVegas, NY to the Bay and
Toronto to MIA and all I have to say is oh my god
LAX up to the Hollywood hills
Remembering you girl is giving me chills
I remember shoppin, then remember poppin, rockin, that was so good

And we had something in common, no strengths meant no problems
but the feelings you caught them

And the funny thing is nobody knew what was between me and you
I think about the things we would do this time it was true
Cuz' what we had was love on the run
And we were having so much fun
Keepin it movin', keepin it movin', I'm sorry we're done
With this love on the run

London Town to the Islands, Philippines up the coast through the Tyland
See we was on a world tour, ain't no one could tell us a thing
I remember for the rest of my life, when we was wildin' up in Paris that night
Lovin you in Africa, was so magical, it's so sad that we're through, oh baby

And we had something in common, no strengths meant no problems
but the feelings I caught them

And the funny thing is nobody knew what was between me and you
I think about the things we would do this time it was true
Cuz' what we had was love on the run
And we were having so much fun
Keepin it movin', keepin it movin', I'm sorry we're done
With this love on the run

I wish that we could do it all again
And I might have you tell me when
The time place and where, baby I'll be there
For just one more chance to love ya, for
just one more chance to love you!

And the funny thing is nobody knew what was between me and you
I think about the things we would do this time it was true
Cuz' what we had was love on the run
And we were having so much fun
Keepin it movin', keepin it movin', I'm sorry we're done
With this love on the run

Yeah Yeah Woaaaahh, woaahhh, woaaahhh
Yeah, ooohhh, with this love on the run
Yeah, woaaahhhhh, aye, with this love on the run</pre>
