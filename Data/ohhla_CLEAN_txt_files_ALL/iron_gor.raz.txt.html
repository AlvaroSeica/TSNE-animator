Yeah, Razah Rubiez, Renaissance, Iron Gorillas

[Hell Razah]
While there's wars in Lebanon
I write it like King David in Psalms
See I was born to them horns of Saravan
Yeah, it's Ariel Sharon, the suicide bomb
Nat Turner nightmares and chasing Uncle Tom's
(Get 'em, get 'em) El-Razial code name: we Medatron
I got 'em open like dope vain for methadone
Without a right to bare arms, I'm mentally the don
You can't fuck with the God, he's seven bars beyond
They love to hate it and translate it and read it wrong
My definition is nonfiction I rhyme different
Then your everyday rap gimmick design image
You invented a clone of DNA digit

Number 472; 82; 87; 71 step to the front
It's time to stand up man
You've been called to be shipped
We're like endangered species right now

We might as well go and bury our self, we need help
Seek health, like knowledge and self
They tried to tell me I can't blow
'Cause I ain't tap-dancing like Sambo
My pants low from that Black Market Commando
I stand for righteousness, truth and straight facts
It's combat, gimme a drum and hard hats
Is this a office or a court room?
Burn my contract
Tell these Indies and these Majors I want my songs back
Make your moms buy iPod and download that
I'm on that seventy, thirty tilting my derby
Ayo these niggas is chicks they all purty
They smirk like they're trustworthy ready to murk me
I'm poison for the bloodthirsty begging for mercy
I'm blowing on that *sniff* sour Ds, mixed it with Hershey's
I spit it heavenly, my wisdom transform the melodies
Being black is like I already been born with felonies
A hundred bars like a Centipede pray for enemies
I got genes in me from the unseen and dead poets
Claustaphobic to one track minds that ain't focused

(Chorus) Razah
We might as well go and bury our self
We need help, seek health
Like knowledge and self or get shelved
Lord help us, you gotta measure your wealth it's all else
You gotta measure your wealth it's all else
We might as well go and bury our self
We need help, seek health
Like knowledge and self or get shelved

(Razah talking)
We need help more time
We're suffering
It's time to send out the war cries and ride out
The Government wanna kill us man
They want us dead and in prisons</pre>
