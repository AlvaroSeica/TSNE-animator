[Chorus]
It's the C. to the R. to the O.S.S.
We make you MOVE with the M. to the E.N.T.
We preach the C. to the R. to the O.S.S.
Coming at you with the Gospel frequently

I'm free from the bondage of having to sin
having to give in loving the world's top ten
having to not win when I struggle
free to love the Lord with all of my might
seeing life with all of my sight
vision unimpaired and clearer than ever
now is my faith, my salvation nearer than ever
nearer than when I first believed
then when I first received life from the giver
well springs spring up inside right from the river
Euphrates style, you fraidy cats prowl on the fence and howl in defense
I'd rather find out how to repent to the wildest extent
while this world wallows away in there childish events
stuck in the mode of thuggin' and livin for the moment
livin every moment as the Lord's opponent
askin' to be forgivin but givin' poor atonement
hopin' the thought that there isn't really more condones it
but don't it ever seem strange and deranged
to see art work with no author's name on the frame?
The wise move is to check to see if
the architect has supplied tools to help us dig deeper
to fall in-love with a God who could rig Easter
to rescue the rest of us from the grim reaper
And if you trust Him to save you, you can trust Him to keep ya

[Chorus]

Until then, my dealings and my feelings
are controlled by the wheel in
the middle of my will, ILL
I fell hell would have caught me
but Christ came And Blood brought me
His love sought me, located me and so faithfully has been
Making me what I am now
when shall this Lord be seen as responsible
for all that my team has that's worth havin' worth grabbin'
for with both hands
let go of earth's fabric and come closer than you've ever been
to your soul's medicine
jettison this world and it's trends then yours'
and Christ's life can begin

[Chorus]

I'm not rhymin' because I like to floss
I toss mics for Christ then step to the left like a right cross
and let Him take the center stage
and set the temperature gage
and get set to blow the spot like ten grenades
cause ever-since a tender age
I've moved with the Lord and stayed
where the alters and tents were made
So even when the temple is raised then set ablaze
I'll stay true and give like the Jews when the tenth was gave
Transitionin' it's hard to find a man listenin'
to the Lord without raisin' his hand's dissin' Him
only true sons see His hand's discipline
and have to hand it to Him like wow for how he handles them
That's when you know you're not ill-legitimate
even when you get ill a little bit
Days later you still are feelin' it
you don't understand who you dealin' with
cause you over there frontin' and actin' like you ain't feelin' it
Lookin' all hard and beatin your chest
either come to Christ and live or continue breathin to death
Those are the only two options I can suggest
if you can still look at this God and not get impressed
He came from the highest of heights to the deepest of depths
to buy us at sin's price so we can be repossessed
