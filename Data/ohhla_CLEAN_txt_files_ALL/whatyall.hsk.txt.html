(Rock talking)
I'm burying niggas up in this bitch.
I see you niggas son. I see you. I know what y'all niggas want.
I KNOW what y'all niggas want! This is what it's come down to.
All the motherfucking players, they done ran over
to the dark side and shit. Everybody hard again.
These players wanna be gangstas now, and everybody and they mother 
nd they 3 year old son wanna be a rapper now.
This shit is crazy. There's an old saying - 
in the land of the blind, the man who has one eye is king -
and I got one eye.

(Rock)
Yo,
Say it's not so
Rocko got a fro
Don't get mad, you ain't get mad when Puffy let the Lox go
New improved Rocko
The fix is up you dig?
And you gon' hate to hate me, that means you love me kid
What it is
A nigga you ain't seen in a while
We been out, doing shit rappers be dreamin about
That crime shit, talk about, but really shook about
Since you last seen me, three times I've been in Brooklyn House
But finally, the crook is out, and this time it's for good
Well, you can never really tell it's forever drama in the hood
But y'all some good damn good actors
Had the whole world convinced that you're really a bunch of hardcore rappers
But you asked for it- Who want beef? Well here's war!
Flip Rock around, Hard Rock, and spell hardcore
Want more? If I sound gassed, pardon me y'all
But I must say, I'm the shit that y'all be stompin for
You don't believe me?

(Chorus)
The piece on your chain says hide
And a special bling bling for those rings you got
What them niggas ?????  since 85'
In the same hood, if not the same ass block
Yo, I know what shorties like
Sometimes they like it in the morning, cuz they joint be light
You got a drinky drink? What's making it cool?

*What's that niggas name again? ROCK*

(Talking)
Yo son, I know you nice, them niggas is fronting son, them niggas be
penetrating the floor son.

(Rock)
Go ahead, call it a comeback! I ain't mad
I've been gone for years
But I prefer to call it a comeup, for me and my peers
Things have changed, but duke, keep this in mind
I'm still the same old G like Ginuwine
Why I knew something smelled fishy, so I left Duck Down
Felt niggas was trying to diss me, like Starr and Buckwild
What now? The cat is out of the bag
You parted on stank terms, but I'm not even mad
I just had enough of it, tired of fronting
Like we was one big happy family, we just wasn't
It ain't nothing my fans, Rockman's here for y'all
Shorties want me, they can have me, I ain't scared of y'all!
Tear the walls to shreds, all you Thong Song bitches
Now you bitches making up a new Schlong Song bitches
In the Hong Kong, bitches swarm the Rock
You ain't no better, all you chasing some form of Rock

(Chorus) X2

(Lidu Rock)
*Who that nigga that be breaking all the rules? ROCK*

(Woman Talking)
Rock, Rock, Rock, Rock.my ass. Nigga what's your real name?

(Rock)
Mr. Alvin Catraz, call me Traz for short
Send punks to me after court, with Magnum Force
My momma taught me ???????
I call my Desert Eagle Al Sharpton
Cuz he stick up for all my peoples
All the ladies in the house say (owww)
Cuz they want me, got a foot fetish so they call me Al Bundy
Alvin! Damn I'm in trouble again son
I study like a monk on how to get chips, but not Alvin Chipmunk
Alcatraz only mean ROCK!
Ask Sean Connery, or Sean Price since you forgot
Scar on my face but I'm not Al Pacino
But I'm an Alkaholik like J-Ro, Swift and Rico
Come again! Alcatraz the unescapable, unbreakable ROCK
Guy that make the scene hot as a twat at a Tyson spot
An ????? when business is good
Most things you wouldn't understand unless you live in my hood
Brownsville, a Brownsvillian full of adrenaline
My sounds killin them
I'm one of the nicest ever, word to Phil and them
I'm everything you want, say I'm not
All of y'all in some form or way be chasing Rock!

(Chorus)X3

(Talking)
Son I'm telling you son, all that is serious son.
When you wake up in the morning son, you rock son!
That little ????, there's rocks in it son!
My ring? There's rocks in it son!
Yo, you know what you be talking about son.
You gotta solidify yourself man. That's what I like man.
As a people we needto grow like that.
So, give me 5 dollars man. You know I'll pay it off man.</pre>
