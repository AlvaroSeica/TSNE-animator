[Ad-libs]
Yeah

It's that blood connection (tell it)
Mark Twain-Twain-Twain-Twain!
Southwest Armstrong with this game
Baby, baby, believe that!

[Chorus]
We keep it crunk off the RIP, what?
Bankhead stay crunk off the RIP, what?
Boulevard keep it crunk off the RIP, what?
Robinson stay crunk off the RIP, what?
ATL stay crunk off the RIP, what?
Decatur, Georgia keep it crunk off the RIP, what?
Sinson Road they keep crunk off the RIP, what?
Stockbridge (come on) crunk off the RIP (RIP)

[Verse 1: Khujo Goodie]
Off the RIP don't trip
You got a family, think about them
Stop looking at me like he never seen it happen, on T.V
Heard you were jacking
Back it up chop, chop tear it up
Snatching longfish like taking taking candy from a baby manny's gravy, uh
Maybe you shouldn't try to sell homes then you slowing the drive throwing up
on back woods like you should you could
Get your dough
Spit
Red trunk mixed rat blue onions
Cut to the ATL pump
Represent the crypt we keep it crunk all day thick
If I could, get my nuts but
You gots to have energy
When you snatching these jinx out they wood grain 2K
Heading 99 mile per hour thinking these but head
Keep it old school youngin'
All black now let me put it in
This week is average this week big body biz
Get the green light if you have any problems, it's rare
We get another more cooperative so I'm a hate hero
Thinking cool drama but getting shredded like some coleslaw, oh
It's so raw, but beating people and rapping is my bread and butter
But off the rails I keeps it gutter
Uh, off the RIP, uh

[Chorus]
'Jo Goodie keep it crunk off the RIP
Mark Twain stay crunk off the RIP, what, what, what?
Armstrong keep it crunk off the RIP
It's hard hard (what?) we keep it crunk off the RIP, what?
Northside stay crunk off the RIP
Southside stay crunk off the RIP, what, what, what?
Westside stay crunk off the RIP
Eastside stay crunk off the RIP, what, what, what?

[Verse 2: Mark Twayne]
Yeah, you know once you jump off it ain't no pulling back
On the corner bumping marijuana and powder packs
These niggaz watching my every move off in the hood
The po-po all in my grille, but it's still, all wood (wood)
Stay to the ground with this thing called representing the South
What they don't know about this dirty I tell it from my mouth
It's blood connect so don't act like you ain't heard it before
Gone jump this thing off the RIP when we step through the door
This for my folk in the trap, bumping them triple Z's
Ain't making enough on they check working at Mickey D's
And all my folk in deject with a baby to feed
Done came up on some of that hard and got O's for them G's
What it is, what it ain't
They killing off in the paint
Little buddy got hit with a slug over a bag of dank
Ways of the streets
Laws of the concrete, dirty
Hit the gas so we can make this bitch crank, dirty
It's off the RIP

[Chorus]
Goodie MOB keep it crunk off the RIP
Youngbloodz stay crunk off the RIP, what, what, what?
Attic Crew they get crunk off the RIP
Unknowns stay crunk off the RIP, what, what, what?
Slic Patna stay keep it crunk off the RIP
Dungeon Family stay crunk off the RIP, what, what, what?
GA keep it crunk off the RIP
Everybody stay crunk off the RIP

[Verse 3: Southwest Armstrong]
Came hotter than the two out
Pistol, that's off the RIP
Don't tolerate controversy just fill you with holes and watch it drip drop
Come out and ride this thing cause sailing deeper than Nova
Ain't nothing cooler on thirties and fours
Catch this bitch in my rims
I'm back just pimping my prim
Let me pre-school you slow, ho
And we'll be rolling you ain't knowing about this street lesson
They fully loaded on currency and weapon
And bids up to the power of suggestion
That's off the RIP
I'm just a felon away from wasting your ass and doing the time with no guilt
Follow the script
Reverse this game like eights
When I hit your state spitting game
Leaving them hoes drip
Like somebody taking prints and making monster grip
Standing tall and then fall this game on gold stilts
Busting at haters, that's off the RIP
That's off the RIP

[Chorus]
Uh, Zone 1 keep it crunk off the RIP
Zone 2 staying crunk off the RIP, what, what, what?
Zone 3 keep it crunk off the RIP
Zone 4 staying crunk off the RIP, what, what, what?
Zone 5 keep it crunk off the RIP
Parrot Home staying crunk off the RIP, what, what, what?</pre>
