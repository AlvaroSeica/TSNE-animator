[K-Rino]
Say man, think you can out-speak us?
I'll tape your mouth shut and make you keep on throwing up until your cheeks buss
My pinnacle is where no men will go
My wins count twice bro, so after my fifth battle, I was 10 and 0
I'll blow your chest away, lowers is where is best to lay
I did everything on your career resume yesterday
Better call some help but by the time they come
You'll be ate up like a baseball team leading 9 to 1
You never made a mixtape so stop bluffing
In the rap game you're like Larry Fitzgerald cuz you don't drop nothing
Your chance to ever win will hit a dead-end
Soon as I put the thread in, instant rigor mortis begins to set in
You contemplating dissing? Better back off man
The only thing stronger then my flow is your jack-off hand
His mama told him if he lose, he better not come back in that fence
That was five years ago, this fool ain't seen his mama since

(Chorus)
When it's time to rhyme
I don't say nuttin' I just duck
Words pumping from my throat executing rappers who bonk
When it's time to rhyme
Some start ripping and others fold
I'm leaving emcees locked in a verbal submission hold
When it's time to rhyme
Suckers get nervous and try to walk
Cuz they specialize in a buncha studio talk
When it's time to rhyme
Bars hang their mics on the shelf
It's only two types of rappers, me and everybody else

[K-Rino]
That verse you said about me, you gon' pay for that
Apologizing ass like your grandma getting breast implants, too late for that
So you a constant reenactment of slackness
You gotta practice just to work your way up to wackness
I'm blowing skin patches off rappers and gon' savage
You become a statistic like an athlete scoring average
I'll should smack you just for trying that bull
He so dumb he tried to leave me a voicemail to tell me mine was full
To me it seems like you haven't been rehearsing in awhile
I'll reverse this frown on my face and curse you with a smile
I don't have to tell the people that you get worst with every style
Cuz when they hear you as a parent like a person with a child
The burden of being this great, you know you can't shoulder it
So like the dot on the lower case side, trick get over it
Another day, another verse to say, another flow to spit
Cuz like a pigeon in Alaska, trick I drop the coldest shit

(Chorus)

[K-Rino]
You on the road to destruction, I'm mapping the course for ya
If you married to the game, then I'm the divorce lawyer
I'll punch ya wit' UFC fighter beez
Step to me and I'll promise you'll get touched more then typewriter keys
Me and you? No comparing us, son
You couldn't be in the same breath as me if we was sharing along
And it ain't wise criticizing my skill
That's suicide like an Indy 500 driver that sleep at the wheel
I reveal coward rappers talking about they use gun
The only nine you ever touched was followed by two ones
My rhyme scheme are out of your most exotic dreams
Eternal, while yours go bad like month old collard greens
When I step in I'm focused, I spit dragon flame to win
No one remembers losers, by the way what was your name again?
I'm known to buss a lyrical cap, and splat your fragments on the globe
So I'll guess you can say I put you on the map

(Chorus)</pre>
