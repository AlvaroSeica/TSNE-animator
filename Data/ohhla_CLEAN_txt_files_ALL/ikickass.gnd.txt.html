[VERSE 1]
Introducin Daddy U and Steady Flow
Lights, cameras, action, let's go
Nude and fat girls attack the tall mack
The chumps who lack fall back cause they all wack
So while they play the rear girlies stay to hear
Me and Kay make you say: hooray and cheer
Rockin steady, straight and continuous
Cool and casual, nothin too stringuous
Cause I like to flow smooth, keepin a slow groove
And I don't give a fuck if you don't move
Cause either way I still get mine
Combine and design dope lines of all kind
My competition stands stiff as a tree trunk
The dope I got is much rawer than P-Funk
Cause artificial stimulation don't last
But I maintain and remain to kick ass
I got somethin to say that you shouldn't miss
You get with this? (Oh, my goodness!)
Stay out the kitchen, the heat is too hot
And cookin the pot is the I dot U dot
And I.U. is the name they call me
The six foot tall grand daddy of em all, gee
I'm comin atcha like a wild rhinoceros
Take my crown? That shit sound preposterous
Cause all those attemptin to do such
Get caught in a clutch cause the U's just too much
It only take one look and you're under my spell
Then you fell, what the hell, now you wonder why
You can't match the things I accomplish
You ever try to step to this, you get stomped, bitch
Those who flam I slam, and goddamn
When I step in a jam you all scram
Cause I get nitro, hot as a micro-
Wave and behave buckwild like a psycho
As I laugh and do as I prefer to do
Don't even crack a smile while I murder you
You fuckin chump
Hey yo Kay, let the system pump
I kick ass

        (I'ma give ya action)
        (I'ma kick yo ass)

[VERSE 2]
Never in life have you heard such poetry
Cause ain't no man alive who can flow with me
All opponents get dust off quick fast
And you can kiss me, Kay Cee and Easy Rick ass
Smoother than this can no three men flow
For those who didn't know I provide info
For you and yours and his and hers
So yo, here's the scoop on what the group does
I kick ass cause the U is the violent kind
And get sporty with a forty of Ballantine
While my man Easy Rick picks a skeezy chick
Bust off and break north with a greasy dick
And deejay Kay Cee cuts superb
Six lick tricks on a mix and you're to the curb
Competition gets worse and worse, you curse
Rehearse, but still ain't get prop the first
Fuckin with me's more deadly than cyanide
And those who collide all die, so you try and hide
But in a bout you're gettin rendered senseless
Defenseless now it's time to commence this
I write rhymes that keep the crowd cheerin
Say type shit you never thought about hearin
Not just the same old same with a slight change
I elevate to an untouchable height range
Beyond the stars Mars, Venus and Jupiter
No way, no how, no man can get stupider
So cut the crap and save all the foolishness
There'll never be an MC as cool as this
So play the back, boy, fuck the bullshit
Try to get flip, I guarantee that you'll get
Your ass kicked, stretch ya just like elastic
Broke like plastic, you stupid bastard
You shoulda known not to fuck with I.U.
Now I bet you're petro and try to
Cause I make the mic bust off like a Mac-10
And keep the whole auditorium packed in
Front to back from the stage to the hallway
Kay'll blaze on the fade like always
Rippin the slice and dice, cuts are twice as nice
While I add spice to the mic device
My rap style's the best in the biz
Word to miz, think it ain't what it is?
Cause rhyme after rhyme each verse flows loosely
Hittin like a brick and kickin like Bruce Lee
What I invent keep the crowd content
I chew MC's like a stick of bubble mint
Knock em out the box and totally annihilate
One thing I hate is cheepskates who violate
Smile in my face, give me a pound or a handshake
Then behind my back you flip like a pancake
But all of that is envy and jealousy
A better MC than me you'll never be
You bum, you get nothin, son, not a mere crumb
Now I'ma smack the wax off your eardrum
Back off the set, pack your bags and flee
Nah fuck it - call the police
If that don't work, then got a order of protection
But still I roll in your direction
I blast, harrass and surpass quick fast
Any MC who fuck with me, yo gee, I kick ass

        (I'ma give ya action)
        (I'ma kick yo ass)

Yo
The Grand Daddy U is definitely on the map, homes
You know what I'm sayin
My man Easy Rick and DJ Kay Cee
Straight out Hempsted, Long Island, homes
Know what I'm sayin
Fuck all the bullshit

        (I'ma kick yo ass)</pre>
