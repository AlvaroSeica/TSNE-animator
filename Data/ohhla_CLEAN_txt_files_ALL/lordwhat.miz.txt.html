[Intro: Krayzie Bone]
I need another motherfucking cigarette, shit, fuck that

[Chorus: Krayzie Bone]
Niggaz start to riot, it'll never be peace
Would you forgive me lord, (We'll never get freedom) if I killed that man
Nigga bust your gun, nigga motherfuck peace
Would you forgive me lord, (My niggaz want freedom) if I killed that man
Niggaz start to riot, it'll never be peace
Would you forgive me lord, (Until we get freedom) if I killed that man
Would you forgive me lord, (We'll never get freedom) if I killed that man
Nigga bust your gun, nigga motherfuck peace
The man that tried to run up and rob me blind and nigga for devils intend

[Hook]
Now they say daylight come but me won't go home (I wanna go..I wanna
go..wanna go) Daylight come but me can't go home (I gotta..gotta..gotta..gotta)
I've been living been in this cell for too long (I've been gone way too long)
Daylight come and I just wanna go home
They say daylight come but me won't go home
(Daylight..daylight..daylight) (I wanna go..I wanna go..wanna go)
Daylight come but me can't go home (I gotta..gotta..gotta..gotta)
I've been living been in this cell for too long (I've been gone way too long)
Daylight come and I just wanna go home

[Verse 1: Asu]
Nigga tried to ride, hellraisin'
Figured he could get at me since my man was blazin'
So we cooked up some type of strategy
But don't be hurtin'
I keep my shells and turtles in all plans is for this war, like milk went to curdle
Cause see I ain't or ever been scared, just prepared
Nigga wanted to make primetime so that ass got air
On the news, blew the wrong fuse, payed more than dues
And for the crime, he got the coffin and all I got was the county blues

[Verse 2: Shade Sheist]
The justice just mailed me to a crucifix
They gave me 2 and a 6 for a brick, I'm feelin sick
The frame was narcotics and the body
Its funny, Kray, my strap was a nine, so I could murder this hotty with a shotty
Justine, she tried to sell her soul, for parole
But at the same time I'm gettin day time, L.P. weight time for droll
Too intelligent son, to hold the foe
So now we demonstrate, articulate, gonna rival the storm

[Verse 3: Krayzie Bone]
Shit, when I heard the cell door drop I knew my it was over
My life known on the outside does not exist no longer
Caught up in the system
I'm fucked took away my freedom
I'm stuck Man
I pace my cell late at night wondering what the fuck have I done
(Lord, what have I done?)
By the way my name is Slim and I'm in here for murder in the first
degree on some niggas who put up and tried to murder me
Self defense that ain't how the judge saw it
Said I was a menace because of my prior record and he was sorry that he had to do it
But hey, should I believe him, if he was sorry motha fucker wouldn't have sent me away
That's why when niggas start to ride, it'll never be peace until we get freedom

[Chorus: Krayzie Bone]

[Verse 4: K-Mont]
Man, I can't believe this shit
I never thought I'd be doin a bid
But whats really fucked up, is that my wife just had my kid
And now I never get to see him take his first step
I guess I shoulda thought twice before I loaded the Tech
Hey yo, my brother was hustlin he had Pitcher Lock
He had the money and hoes, the hatas started to plot
After a while he got murdered, I hadda get his revenge
Ya, I hit the block up, all his foes and his friends

[Chorus: Krayzie Bone]

[Outro: Krayzie Bone]
Now let me hear you scream fuck tha police (Fuck tha police)
Pump your fist and scream fuck tha police (Fuck tha police)
Let me hear you scream fuck tha police (Nigga, fuck tha police)
Pump your fist and scream fuck tha police (Fuck tha police)
Now let me hear you scream fuck tha police (Fuck tha police)
Pump your fist and scream fuck tha police (Fuck tha police)
Now let me hear you scream fuck tha police (Fuck tha police)
Now pump your fist and scream fuck tha police (Fuck tha police)
Let me hear you scream...</pre>
