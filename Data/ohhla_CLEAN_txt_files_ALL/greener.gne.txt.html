[Chorus] [Pigeon John] [x2]
No more greener grass
Love what you got or you lose what you have
There's no more greener grass
Just stay steady on your path, hey
No more greener grass
Love what you got or you lose what you have
There's so much more to grab
Just stay steady on your path, hey

[Verse One] [Pigeon John]
I feel like I'm in high school again
Trapped in the nerd stable
Watchin' the jocks floss at the cool table
They rockin' and they got signed to cool labels
I'm jockin' and I got signed to a fool's fable
That Pigeon John is the bomb
Is that why I'm lookin' for part time work with Joey The Jerk?
At Trader Joes
Another brick in the wall I suppose
That I chose a profession and a life on the road
Slangin'
Like a travelin' salesman
But instead of vacuums I'm sellin' packed rooms and my CD
That's when I see these niggas blingin' in 3D
Makin' it quite hard not to envy
Every time I flip through Urb magazine
I see all my friends blowin' up and turn green
They don't deserve it more than I do
And that's the kind of thinkin' that will begin to kill you

[Chorus] [Pigeon John] [x2]
No more greener grass
Love what you got or you lose what you have
There's no more greener grass
Just stay steady on your path, hey
No more greener grass
Love what you got or you lose what you have
There's so much more to grab
Just stay steady on your path, hey

[Verse Two] [The Grouch]
Well, I'm not tryin' to chase a mirage
Or play like, "Hey, we got it made", I got evil to dodge
Don't need my ego massaged
Just my feet and my back, now go deep with the job
Complex inventions can make your life simple 
I'm stranded in the thick of the fields, feel the winds blow
Ten toes plus fingers, your straight
Keep your stinkin' ass off my grass, life's great
I might say it different if I wasn't so happy
So happy I'm different I might say it to catch me
My whole world's a crop circle
Green as can be
Communicate with Venus cause a he needs a she
And she needs what I got and I got it to give
I'll pot it and push it minus preservatives
Deservin' this? Well, you decide for yourselves
No fungus among us, abundance of wealth now

[Chorus] [Pigeon John] [x2]
No more greener grass
Love what you got or you lose what you have
There's no more greener grass
Just stay steady on your path, hey
No more greener grass
Love what you got or you lose what you have
There's so much more to grab
Just stay steady on your path, hey

Greener and greener and greener it grows</pre>
