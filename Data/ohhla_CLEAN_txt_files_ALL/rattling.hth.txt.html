[Chorus 2X]
We came and we conquered, they praying to poppa
They claiming they want to, they really don't want to
You ain't maiming a monster, so don't bother with offers
Till the day that I die, I ain't stepping aside for one of you

[Pressure]
Check, when I start breathing heavily, I scar the beat and melody
They said that we're dreaming, we'll keep reaching till we're leaving heavenly
The key to freedom's said to be, release and leave the memory
Think you offended me? Please, with critics like these, who needs an enemy?
Indeed a breed of pedigree, beast unleashing speech telepathy
Here to bleed to industry of its diseased and evil effigy
Demons, thieving, greed and revelry, we in need and seeking remedy
But it seems to stay ten feet ahead of me like a centipede
I'm a train upon a track, I'm a flame upon a match
Ain't straying from my place, I want my face upon the map
I'm the weight upon your back, I'm a razor on your lap
We came to conquer stage and opera, fade it onto black
Now hush, hear the voice
So addicted to the rush to fill the void
Dismissing everything, we love to feel joy
Build it up, then we crush, kill, destroy

[Chorus 2X]

[Suffa]
Ay, ay, ay, ay
I go bananas every time, mind blown, Nirvana, Nevermind
They need some ketamine to calm us, harness the darkness every line
Till I've been enlightened, I'm leaving 'em terrified
like Bin Laden been hiding under their bed every night they go beddy-bye
Fat as the fattest Federline, fat as that cat post-Britney
Madness, that is a friend of mine, rappers get mashed so quickly
War comes, hear the roar from the raw drums, beat your poor son just from the boredom
Jump up, but you're stunned, dumbstruck, you're done like Young Buck post-Fifty
We claw at the morons, and pour on the soothing hooks on heaters
like them pouring the Boron on the core on the shore of Fukushima
They adore the recordings and we lording it over them
Think we're joking? Then we're going door to door with some Dobermans
(Woof!) No DMX
They thinking they got me pegged like BMX, but ain't seeing T or X
Briggs, Hons, Debris or Vents, we the best, no Khaled
We the best like Ali, Muhammad

[Chorus 2X]

[Pressure]
Rattling the keys
Rattling the keys
Rattling the keys to the kingdom

"Let me tell you what it's all about" - Posdunos
"Turn this underground rap thing to my kingdom" - Guru
