[Chorus]
(The Banana Clip Theory)
I cain't believe I took it this far, this time (The Banana Clip Theory)
I told myself, I should be smart.. and not blind (The Banana Clip Theory)
Bang bang bang, down we went today..
Lord, I think there's something wrong (The Banana Clip Theory)
Bang, bang, bang, another bullet went astray...
Another soul dead and gone (The Banana Clip Theory)

[Big K.R.I.T.]
I heard a gun the other day
It spoke to me and told me power
was the only thing that we could lose
So don't be afraid to let it shower, on them
if they ever run up at my door
It came with a red dot, for a sure shot 
and a silencer on the low
I had to stop, pause and think about it 
while it gave me its resume
Told me no better way to protect myself
In this world we live in 
cause they killin up women and children
Ain't nothing like havin one on hand
Cause if you draw down first, you'll be the man
Then you'll pop yo' trunk and demand
That respect, if they neglect, in the club...
When they touched my queen they didn't know what we had was love...
And it'll never be the same cause you'll throw it in my face just because...
So I'll pop my trunk once again 
For her heart I'll defend
and I'll let it rain on them 

[Chorus]

[Big K.R.I.T.] 
I heard he just killed a man..
I think he was a father... 
I know he was a brother..
Because his sis said that they gon' retaliate tomorrow
The doors still revolvin, gun shop
You're lookin for the kinda clip that don't stop
Cause you heard them jack boys comin for the very spot
That you opened up on they block
They wore red but you bang blue... 
They drove by but they ain't shoot...
'Til you was outside with the whole fam, havin brews 
Talkin shit, eatin barbeque
Duck and dodge, but it ain't safe 
You hit the corner but they gave chase
And double back cause you got away
But your little cousin got hit, sleepin in his baby crib
No CPR cause it's too late
So you cry, but you bounce back
Your reply is to get the gat
It's an eye for an eye 'til it's jet black
The only way you'll survive in yo' mind is to stay strapped
So you act out...
They'll call you soft if you back out...
So you roll your window down and you black out
The next day they'll be back 'round

[Chorus]</pre>
