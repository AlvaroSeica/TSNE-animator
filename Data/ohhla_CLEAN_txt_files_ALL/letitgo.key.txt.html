[Keyshia Cole - Intro]
You need to get if he don't wanna
LOVE you the right way, he ain't gonna
It ain't where he's at, it's where he..
WHERE HE WANNA BEEE, YEAH-HEAA

[Missy Elliott]
YO KEYSHIA!
YES!! (Whoo!)
Fire.. (uh-huh)
I like this one right here
This one for all my ladies y'all
Holla! Uhhhhhhh-huh
Let's go!

I don't want'cho maaaaan, 'cause I got it like that
But it ain't even gotta be like dat, eh-heh-heh-heh-heh
Yo' man he be callin me back
He say I'm fine and a matter of fact - heh-heh-heh-heh
He ask how I do that that fit my jeans over Baby Phat
Listen, I don't know the type of tricks he playin
But I should warn you, I don't want yo' man (c'mon)

[Keyshia Cole - Verse One]
I understand why you wanna try
to make him stay home late at night
But if he wanna go, he'll be GONE no lie
I can't explain how many times I tried
How many times I cried
thinkin about mine and where he might be
(Baby, I don't wannaaaaa know)
Remember when I gave everything I've got
Couldn't get deep down inside
How you love someone who didn't love me? (c'mon)
But now I get if he don't wanna
love you the right way, he ain't gonna
It ain't where he''s at it's where he, where he wanna beeeee

[Chorus 2X]
If he ain't gonna love you, the way he should
then let it goooo
If he ain't gonna treat you, the way he should
then let it goooo

[Missy Elliott]
When this song come on in the club, they gon be like
Daaaaaaaaaaamn, that's hot
And when they play it in the car, they gon' drop they tops like
Daaaaaaaaaaamn, that's hot (WHOOP!)
They gon' mix it with Biggie, "IT WAS ALL A DREAM.." like
Daaaaaaaaaaamn, that's hot
Me and Keyshia don't stop, 'til the tick don't tock like
Daaaaaaaaaaamn, that's hot

[Keyshia Cole - Verse Two]
Now understand why I take my time
cause you come with alibis
Tryna get me to see that's where you tryna be
But I don't want your man!
Your man's been callin me, tryna get me to see
that he wants me to be with him
but he ain't the one for meeeee
But if you only knew (only kneeeeew)
You would, do what you had to
Finally see that (finally get the chance to see that...)
You need to get if he don't wanna
LOVE you the right way, he ain't gonna
It ain't where he's at, it's where he..
WHERE HE WANNA BEEE, YEAH-HEAA

[Lil' Kim]
Uh, uh, uh
Here's a little lesson, Lil' Kim don't stress 'em
Kick 'em all straight to the curb like Beckham
Broke wit my ex, he with her for now
but little do she know, she's just a rebound (HEEY!)
Callin my phone, she's so outta pocket
I been there before ol' girl, you need to stop it
When he's with you, he's wishin it was me
You might be where he's at, but I'm where he wanna be
Baby, BAY-BAY!

[Chorus]

[Missy Elliott]
HANDS UP IN THE AIR!!
When this song come on in the club, they gon be like
Daaaaaaaaaaamn, that's hot
And when they play it in the car, they gon' drop they tops like
Daaaaaaaaaaamn, that's hot (WHOOP!)
They gon' mix it with Biggie, "IT WAS ALL A DREAM.." like
Daaaaaaaaaaamn, that's hot (that's right)
Me, Kim, and Keyshia don't stop, 'til the tick don't tock like
Daaaaaaaaaaamn, that's hot

[Missy Elliott - Outro as music fades]
