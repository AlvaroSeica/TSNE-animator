[Mr. Tibbs]
Why you gotta go, home so soon
Why you can't stay here, a little while longer
I'm really liking your company
Don't you know, I thought you know

[Chorus: Mr. Tibbs]
I want you to be my girlfriend, my girlfriend, yea
I want you to be my lady, my lady, oh
I want you to be my wifey, my wifey, my wifey
My baby.. whoa.. whoa..

[Mr. Tibbs]
I just wanna love you, I just wanna, I just wanna tell you
Tell you something, how much you mean to me
You're my everything
You're my queen to be, I'm talking bout a family
Oh, a wifey, I just want you to be

[Chorus]

[Mr. Tibbs]
I thought you know, up on those dues
Yes you thinking, stop thinking negatively
They wanted you, oh, up in my bed
Where are you friends, we gon' party tonight
Yea, babe, we gon' party tonight
Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh
Yeah, baby, baby, I thought you knew

[Chorus]
