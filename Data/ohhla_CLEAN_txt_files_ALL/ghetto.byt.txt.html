If you a ghetto ass bytch, put your hands up (Put 'em up)
Put your hands up (Put 'em up)
Put your hands up (Put 'em up)
If you a ghetto ass nigga, throw your hands up (Throw 'em up)
Throw your hands up (Throw 'em up)
Throw your hands up (Throw 'em up)

[Verse 1]
I'm a ghetto ass bytch nigga yean know
I be buck up in da club plus I'm slangin' dro
I'm a ghetto ass bytch cuz I wear da weave
I'm a ghetto ass bytch cuz I smoke da weed
I'm a ghetto ass bytch I got my dawg on
I'm a ghetto ass bytch I keep my mug on
I'm a ghetto ass bytch cuz I wrote this song
Wit a piece of lipstick and a envelope
I'm a ghetto ass bytch cuz I don't give a fuck
I'm ridin' down the street, bumpin me, so what
I'm a ghetto ass bytch cuz I be pullin' pounds
I'm a ghetto ass bytch because I'm stayin' down
I'm a ghetto ass bytch, I wear fake nails
And if a nigga don't like it he can go to hell
I'm a ghetto ass bytch, but still I'm ridin' clean
You know it's me when you hear da flows and see the bling bling

[Verse 2]
Where my ghetto niggaz at dat keep it so real
And the fuckin' out da frame slangin' pipe dat da deal
Where my ghetto niggaz at dat be buckin' da system
Runnin red lights, and they break 'em off and dismiss 'em
Where my ghetto niggaz at who don't give a fuck
And gettin' head while they drivin' throwin' finger signs up
Where my ghetto niggaz at that keep a mug on they face
Where my ghetto niggaz at who, paper chase
Where my ghetto niggaz at dat keep a glock they side
And if a hater wanna step, watch his bytch ass get tried
Where my ghetto niggaz at that be buck in da club
Cuz these the type of niggaz that we call, ghetto thugz with ghetto luv
