[Werd]
I love and hate this, but its an art form
So if you love it or hate it, its my platform

(Yeah) I love and hate this, its an art form
So love it or hate it, its my platform
We get on spraff on when the mics on
Never be done, still searching for the right song [x2]

Im unique, like everybody else
But words stands out when petulance sells
See I dont need to rap you could read them and tell
That all of my writtens well they speak for themselves
(Haha) Thats the quote of the day
No wait, misquote, thats what they do
We find it so hard in this day and age
Our faces say more than the words displayed
Hey, Im not asking you to like me
Nor am I trying to start pick a fight with
Anyone for anything I do it cause I might be
Heard by one person in the world that feels like me
Honestly, I've been through allot mate
But made allot of mates, tapes and a rock a stage
Got played, got hate, helped out the new
S.O.S. mate, its really all that I do

(Yeah) I love and hate this, its an art form
So love it or hate it, its my platform
We get on spraff on when the mics on
Never be done, still searching for the right song [x2]

[Conscious Route]
Makes me question living in this joke 
They got it wrong like media misquotes 
We form lines while they drop lies like Lockerbie 
They tell us we'd be more secure owning a property 
Creating pictures causing more divide 
Saying hate with tension, our race will survive 
A little more war to bring peace inside 
Were like terrorists fighting these terrorists 
Like Keyser Söze the truth has a cleaver twist 
Or put our faith in a God that has never lived 
Trapping the soul for the greed of another class 
In the system that wont let a brother pass 
You know the problems you seen the stats 
Thats why I live music and breathe for rap 
Keeping hope in my bars so the others can climb 
Or at least have belief in the conscious mind

[Werd]
(Yeah) I love and hate this, its an art form
So love it or hate it, its my platform

[Nity Gritz]
Fuck your life Im here to murder mics
And aye Ill have a couple pints
And punt it off as half the price 
For having me come run your night
Summon any son of God under the fucking sun that you like
It wont stop me (nah) the bastard child is impolite
The sun will fall out of the sky the day he cracks a smile
Somebody hold him back because there he goes he's acting wild
Fuck you and your placid style 
Your scene and shows just standing idle
Im wrecking sets to bless the heads with a perfect recital
I feel its vital to toll a line at the tight rope
Trying to find a balance, like Slug back in 04
Right before I bought a mic and started building a platform
Wording a verse with the perfect bars
Fuck a swag song
Im digging through my tape cassettes with pity for this art form
Feeling like my city dont appreciate the fact Im raw
Or maybe Im wrong because I live in the capital
People forget where it is Im from, and its Glasgow

[Werd]
(Yeah) I love and hate this, its an art form
So love it or hate it, its my platform
We get on spraff on when the mics on
Never be done, still searching for the right song [x2]</pre>
