Intro: 

Word up!
yeah! La The Darkman youknowhatI'msayin'
word up! takin' you on this expedition, tropicanty
word up! the underworld mission
youknowhatI'msayin'
revolution, yo
check it out, yo

Chorus:

The La's invincible
you thug cats i'ma stab on pricipal
better off dead workin' with a glass, go ahead
you got star dream on a corner drinkin' gasoline
my man threw you up in a fiend no contest
Dunn i'm bless and knew a devil in a blue dress
Dunn i'm bless and you a devil in a blue dress

Verse One:

YouknowhatI'msayin', word up! La the Dark...
yo, this brilliant companion peace to the original
approach my slang and end up in critical condition
when I let my shell I ain't missin'
technician, you get stabbed back in position
I know that money bring bitches and bitches on to be trusted
some rappers sniff coke and others be gettin' dusted
city lights, a minute with new books to read
I feed my man lock down, my physicals and my seeds
I ain't got shit, while you rap niggas be playin' wigs
and you the Vegas in the ditch, makin' life cold switch
I'm invincible, you get dead before you start
my night for sharp, push raps spikes to your art
La fight dirty, I strike first I snatch it a purse
inside my verse, takin' to the edge of the earth
and throw you over, son you drunk I smack you sober
assassin, blastin' enough your range rover

Chorus

Verse Two:

triple darkness, yo, expedition
yo, i'm from a long weeded stick up
kids, coke and hustlers
gars for cars, strong arms, Tech dusters
the streets got me in a ocean deep
Khuan i'm leap, a bum told me life is cheap
my lyric's dancin', lamp and eatin' fish in a Wu mansion
apart place i'ma dance and only my wiz i'm romancin'
hostted all you chicken niggas get rosted
I read manuscrip in 97 whips hells is tosted
I say some my minute your Benz and get benit
my guns get more open than a enveloppe with money in it
where I live it's only crack, fiends and dirty jeans
shorties on the block with the platinum drug dream
everything in our seems I got bagged at 14
on a highway runin' guns outta New Orleans
it's La, what you think them niggas trimbellin' pink
stumblelin' you a cat to turn tough on a drink
keepin' you lifted remenisce on what Chris did
pull out the mac and shop for a cat in a scebelian
right in front of the buildin' with kids playin', Shelly's playin'
on the second floor Shelly mom's prayin'
got cough by a stray in a window in broad day
and she die, fucked up and had to be that way
it was a drunk nigga who done it
word up! youknowhatI'msayin', yo

Chorus

Outro:

Word up!
La Trapicanty, youknowhatI'msayin'
you kids better walk straight and masked that you high
youknowhatI'msayin' or you be the next to die
word up! sendin' hands to our live
YouknowhatI'msayin' word up!
triple darkness
supreme, word up!
power for my whole unit
