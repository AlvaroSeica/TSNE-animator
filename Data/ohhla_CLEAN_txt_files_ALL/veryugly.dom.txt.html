[Intro: Dom Pachino]
Yeah, yeah... this shit right here
Is for all my muthafucking snake ass niggas
That cross my path, you know what I'm saying?
Some I caught up with, and I chopped they fucking heads off
And some, have yet to be seen and saught out yet
(I'm a serious fucking dude, man, some serious things, man
Fuck with me, it might cost you your life, yo)

[Dom Pachino]
I declare war on a fake nigga, a snake nigga
Damn, P, that used to be ya nigga
Niggas envy the fact that I can do without him
Eat, shit, sleep without him, pay my bills &amp; build a crew without him
Gemini minds, same sign as Einstein, but will they got him
He's hot, everybody's talking bout him...

[Chorus: Dom Pachino]
Jealousy, is a very ugly thing
Jealousy, is a very ugly thing
Jealousy, is a very ugly thing

[Dom Pachino]
Yo, I'm a winner by nature, and your a hater
You're patent leather, I'm alligator
Hit you up, sayonara, see you later
You fucking with a crusader, whose crew's greater
Pull ya pads out, listen to the street educator
Serve fiends like a waiter, even my neighbors
In my hood I'm considered the mayor
Real hip hop prevailer, you know the flavor

[Chorus]

[Dom Pachino]
Yo, you can't match my heart, nor my glory, end of the story
Purely, in simple terms, you got nothing for me
A chain built with the weak link, will surely break
It's not that the team was weak, just ya ass is fake
Ya ass is snake, you swine like ya ass is jake
Just like ya ass is jake...

[Chorus]

[Outro: Dom Pachino]
And you a bee, that couldn't sting anything...
You know, it's like niggas killed me though, and shit
Like, niggas befriend you, or whatever
Even be childhood buddies, and shit, grow up together
Little knucklehead niggas, and here niggas turn around
And do some real savage shit, knawhatimean
If I had it my way, all snake ass niggas, man
With them intentions, I'll fucking kill 'em, personally, man
KnahImean? Jealousy's a very ugly thing
So knock it off, kids...</pre>
