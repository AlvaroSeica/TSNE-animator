[Intro/Chorus]
OnStar to find the clit, I need OnStar to find the clit {*2X*}
No shit!!

[mc chris]
I pushed the OnStar button a long time ago
Don't you see how late they reactin?
She only cum and she cum when she wanna
I think her junk is dead, hope she's an organ donor
I think I got the basis to find my way to home base
But I'm thinkin of a way if I don't see your "oh face"
I want your teeth clenched, face pressed in the pillows
I want your toes to curl like decomposin armadillos
But, I hear you yawnin while I'm all in your stuff
I want to solve the case of the mysterious muff
So let the curtains billow, snap the panty elastic
And get down to it before we kick it monastic
Your body's fantastic, I like every part
As for the parts I can't find I don't know where to start
There's anxiety inside of me with every performance
So shoot me up a flare and let me know your coordinates

[Chorus]

[mc chris]
I think were on the brink of Armageddon
It's like Freddy shreddin when were sweatin cause we broke the bed in
Went spelunkin in your trunk when I made the descent
I can never get you crunk, a/k/a you're not wet
You, may not believe this I'm a sexual genius
I want you screamin JESUS, while I'm on your mons venus
Understand your hood and glands like the back of my hands
Am I in the ballpark or in the back of the stands?
Just, give me a sign, but don't give me the tap
I've been around the block and seen the charts and the graphs
And what I gather's in your labia it's embedded in flesh
I stir the mac 'n cheese while I wheeze upon her chest
It's time the surgeons take my word and helps me fix my flat
You got a lot that's more requires ranges from my map
I was so alone, and kinda lost, I'm nowhere to be found
It was all for not, upon the spot, until you came around

[Chorus]

[mc chris]
{This is Hally, what's your damage?}
OH THANK GOD! Oh thank God!
My car just hit a deer and did a triple flip into some pine trees
and then rolled down the hill like forty times
I'm upside-down in a river bed
and I'm being attacked by a bear and I'm drowning at the same time
BACK!!! BACK!!! OW!!! OW!!! IT GOT MY LEG!!! IT PEELED MY LEG OFF!!!
{Just sit tight and we'll send someone right out}

[Chorus] - repeat 2X</pre>
