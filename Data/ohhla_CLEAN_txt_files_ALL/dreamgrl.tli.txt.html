[Intro]
The following song is brought to you by Chex Mix

[The Lonely Island]
Some dude once said
That love is a many funny things
I know there's a perfect girl out there for me
Cause I see her, in my dreams

[Chorus: Norah Jones]
Dream girl, you're a fantasy
You're the only one, out there for me
My love

[The Lonely Island]
Dreamgirl you amaze me all dressed in paisley
Love how not one but both eyes are lazy
When I first saw you you were drivin the bus
Thick skin, strong nose like a rhinoceros

Dreamgirl so beautiful, lips all crummy
Skin like asphault, nose so runny
Thick thighs, no waist, not a care in the world
You not crazy girl, you just my baby girl

Yo you envisionin sweats with the neon patch
Half eaten squirrel hangin outta your mouth
Rainbow poncho, the female Tonto
Hear a loud noise drop a bucket like a bronco

[Chorus]

[The Lonely Island]
You got your cell phone ring set to Sex and the City
You like a hot bowl of grits only way more gritty
Straight drippin your turquoise my Santa Fe queen
One short leg you got the Santa Fe lean

It's music to my ears when you scream in your sleep
And when you lift your skirt in public yo I can't help but peek
You like Cleopatra, with the eyes of a pig
Love to watch you in the backout when you go out to dig

Girl how'd you get those mouse traps glued to your neck?
Little rascal, how'd you get screwed to the deck?
You put away slurpees like a trash can
Your smile's all stainy and your not too brainy and..

I LIKE THAT! Talking to your shoes lke it's your friend
I LIKE THAT! Yellin at the walls of make pretend
I LIKE THAT! Tellin you to stop it then you don't
You said you gonna stab me in my sleep BUT YOU WON'T~!

[Norah Jones]
Last week thought I saw you on the street
Turned out it was a bag of trash
Just a big ol' bag of trash
I thought you looked like a bag of trash

[The Lonely Island]
Dream girl I pitch a tent when you stomp in the room
Like a hellbound turkey mixed with a baboon
You're sexy and you'rre spicy like a bowl of Chex Mix
And I always feel safe when I'm in your flesh mitts

Your teeth so clean coulda swore you were British
Never take the Chex Mix cause you always get skittish
Open clamps with both feet cause you're ambidextrous
No point cause we know you eat nothin but Chex Mix

Chex Mix number one food snack in the land
It's the cereal taste, that you eat with your hand
Chex Mix at your local grocer buy your box
Your family will all say - CHEX MIX ROCKS!

[Norah Jones]
Chex Mix, you're the snack for me
You're the only one, I'll ever eat.. or buy
Chex Mix, you're delicious
You got sixty percent less fat, than potato chips
