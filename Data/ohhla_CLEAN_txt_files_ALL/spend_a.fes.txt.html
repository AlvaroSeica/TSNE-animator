[Fes Taylor]
You was the woman I looked for, all of my life
So it's crazy when I met you, even cooked for her
I adore like, walk through the door
And your kisses is the best for sure, I eat you up like
Vegetable sauce, chocolate syrup, strawberry ice cream
Know it might seem like a real life dream
Might seem like a vacation, sex til the day break in
See our faces, like Urkel, 'do I do that?'
Know you want me to do it again
I'm the truth, I can prove it again
Any pain when I'm soothing it in
Round two, kind of like, take a breather
Listen, ma, war, I'm going in
Mami, it's Taylor, I'm so in the cold forward it
No interruptions, your man give you all of him

[Chorus: Fes Taylor]
You ever have it like, you can have it like
Make love all night, maybe you can stay the night
She wanna run wit the Wolves, maybe you can stay the night
Girl you ever had it like, yeah, you know I have you like
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Fes Taylor]
I'm like, Lucy, I'm home, feeling like Ricky Ricardo
But I got 26's on the car, though
I pick you up, even open the car door
Trunk in the front, for ya luggage and ya cargo
She high class like escargo
But keep it on the low, know I get Escobar dough
Like whoa, yo, her toes like a rose, like suppose like
But she don't fuck wit me only cuz my dough right
Let them coles fight, mah, they beneath you like
Right under the sole of your Nike's, I take a whole slice
Bite ya O, I can't even talk about it
Know I can pop it off, you don't need to corp around me
You thought I sounded like I was sincere, so you
Gave me a chance, the reason that I'm here
I hit trials, see you disappear, I'm like, mami, come here
Listen, let me whisper in ya ear

[Chorus]

[Lot-a-Nerv]
Baby girl, I know we been through thick and thin
That's why I promise I'mma love you, until the world end, yeah
You my ace, you my nigga, you my bitch
So it's easy to get down on a knee to commit
I know, when I met you I was messing wit you friend
And we was creeping on the low, but I loved you ever since
Since first time we kissed, to the last time we fucked
Said the backshots was good, yeah, that's prolly why I'm stuck
I know, it's kinda hard, turn a lover from a dog
But I can never in my heart, get enough to do you wrong
Lord knows how I'm feeling, and yeah
We can be together forever, long as the love's will, uh-huh
That's what it is, love, you sick in that Benz truck
That's how my wife stunt, what you coming to pick me up?
Yeah, that's my bitch, man, that's my rider, right there
