[Hell Razah]
Nowadays you can't tell who's a gimmick or real
So I let my gun manage them, to give them the deal
Brought an extra clip with me just to finish the kill
Tell your label that your royalties pay for the bill
You's a write-off artist like an industry mill
Now that contract you just signed became your will
The more I spill, more burners from Israel
Killers couldn't feel what you were spitting if they swallowed an E pill
Sit still, this the barbers chair, Razah be a sharper spear
At midnight my revolvers flair, they heard the young Godfather's near
I pop-pop like it's happy new years
When we meet, wanna pass weed and Heineken beers
When you see me with my polar bears hide your ears
We turn the hood into woods, start hunting the dears
Desert Eagles like Noah, we get them in pairs
One male, one female, then pick up the shells
I bet you stop spitting fire when I send you to Hell
And what's sixteen bars if it ain't in the jail?
You locked without bail in your own brain cell
And wonder why no homies ain't sending you mail
Check it

[Chorus: Hell Razah]
Aiyo it's Hell Razah, all my niggas keep some bail paper
'Cause I'm still gonna sell, haters
Aiyo it's Hell Razah, you only get back what you gave us
So we're feeling like Larry Davis
Aiyo it's Hell Razah, pull chicks driving Navigators
We got lofts with the elevators
Aiyo it's Hell Razah, I only build with them true gangsters
Who got it locked down to the Incas
Aiyo it's Hell Razah</pre>
