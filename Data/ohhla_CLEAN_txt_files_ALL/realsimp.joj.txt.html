[JoJo Pellegrino]
I keep my life story real simple, blood, sweat and tears is what I've been through
Forgive me for sobbing, a motherfucker got a whole lot of shit on his mental
Mom winging it, keep your fingers crossed, I'm successful
Everyday's another struggle, everyday's another hustle
Waiting in a gate full of hate looking for love corrupts you
Daddy's a working man, tells me I'm lazy
Waht job? Trying to rap and get rich, call me crazy
I don't got no benefits, not type of pension plan
Gotta scramble an ounce of weed to see the dentist man
I catch a ?broke rash? and beat your chip for cash
The very next day whipping, blades spinning like I'm clipping your grass
It's nothing, I was built to be large, serving my life behind bars
I killed the track, yeah I'm guilty as charged
This is truly what's in my cards, ain't used to them jobs
Why cock back, aim high and shoot at the stars

[Chorus: DJ Premier Scratching]

[JoJo Pellegrino]
If I spit it, I lived it, if I kick it, I did it
If I said it I meant it, if I ain't got it and I really want it, I'll get it
I'm an ambitious fellow, making the impossible possible
Italian rap extremely marketable, flow's profitable
And if it's not JJP, the kid is junk
Straight jacket, streets is behind me, I get it crunk
Spin that weight from jump, forget about it
Dog I exit the storm when I got with Clue and told him sleep in the trunk
Haters is vexed, almost got hit with a tec
You gotta watch for them dustheads uo in the jex, they get slippery when wet
Ever heard the expression 'it's real in the field'? Respect it
Out in Staten Island the motto is anybody can get it
I'll tell you like Uncle Frankie said it, my man's fears are an ocean
There's alot of shark teeth in the ocean, that's why I stays on point when I'm coasting
Eyes open, can't afford to be dozing, gotta keep it in motion

[Interlude: JoJo Pellegrino]
Yeah, never stoppin, quit demo shopping, you dudes is never dropping

[Chorus]

[JoJo Pellegrino]
When I was young I used to have this dream I was trapped in a car with no one driving
Now I'm grown up and I feel like that when I'm wide awake, grinding, striving
It's never ending and the present is stressing
Even though I took control of the wheel, it's still how I feel
Life's ill, money don't solve problems, it pays bills
My moms sick, I'm never content, shit's real
So I put in work to make her proud
Your baby boy sold millions of records Mrs. Edwards, look at how he lays the crowd
I play the underground first, see how I laid it down
MTV, BET, that's where I take it now
Nothin in the world can stop me, I'm coming full force Papi
Never sloppy, I'm moving properly
Me and my team's been the unit for years
Through the ups and downs, highs and lows, I keep em right here
Be clear, this is GW dealers, masking the children
Take the offer in back of the building and cast it to millions, what

[Chorus w/ JoJo Pellegrino talking over]</pre>
