[Lil' Rob]
(Verse 1)
Contemplatin' the situation
Havin' complicated conversations with lacerations, so
Deep like my sleep
I can't believe that this is what I'm facin'
My heart is racin' and it's breakin'
I can't think straight and I'm spacin', I'm pacin'
Tryin' to figure out the answer to the equation
I need some kind of inspiration
Won't let me in, I got so reservation
Won't let me in, I got no invitation
Relationship with limitations
Imitation
But she gots me chasin'
Don't wanna have to do it
Don't wanna have to say "I didn't wanna have to"
Cause then it's too late
And yesterday is somethin' that I can't go back to (Damn)

Chorus:
{Lil' Rob in background}
[Moox] "Didn't want to have to do it" --&gt; Lovin' Spoonful
[Rob]  See, I don't wanna have to let you go...
[Moox] "Didn't want to have to do it"
[Rob]  Baby tell me that it isn't so...
[Moox] "Didn't want to have to do it"
[Rob]  Cause I don't wanna have to let you go...
[Moox] "Didn't want to have to do it" {No, no, no...}
       "At all (At all, at all)"
       "At all (At all, at all)"

(Verse 2)
I don't wanna have to let you go
I know that we could work this out if you want to, see
God knows how much I want to and how bad I want you
Don't want it if it's not you
You're irreplacable, I was irresponsible, but
Responsible for the break up
But I know the kind of woman you are, and I would do
Anything for the makeup
Can't believe what I did
To make you wanna pack up everything and
Leave with the kids
It's killin' me, but to you, it is what it is and
I just lost my reason to live
Don't wanna have to do it
Cause yesterday is somethin' that I can't go back to
Or else, then I do it
And change everything so I can have you (Man)

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 3)
I write about you cause it's therapeutic, you see
I don't want to have to do it
Let you go because I blew it
Actin' young, dumb, foolish and stupid, I mean, so stupid
What was I thinkin', I wasn't thinkin'
I was drinkin' in lack of (???)
Quit this act in an instance
Withdrew my classes, AA, church, helped me to fix it
So I promise to you, and I promise to God, that Rob
Ain't gonna do the expected
But the unexpected, I consider what you thought I do
For the new, resurrected
Don't want to have to do it
Don't wanna have to say "I didn't wanna have to"
Cause then it's too late
You say it has to be this way, it doesn't have to

Repeat Chorus

Bridge: Moox
"No, I didn't want to have to be, the one
Didn't want to have to be, the one
No, I didn't want to have to be, the one
Didn't want to have to be, the one" --&gt; Lovin' Spoonful

"At all (At all, at all)"
