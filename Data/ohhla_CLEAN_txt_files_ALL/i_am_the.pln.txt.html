I be that
Lyrical narrator, social commentator
Socially commentatin, what I say's verbatim
Verbal stipulator, oral illustrator
Orally illustratin what I'm stipulatin

Drugs rule everything around me
Thugs makin money, my manor, manor's ill yo, ill yo
Pushers on my block shottin rocks, this is real, yo
Bitches suckin cocks for them rocks, yeah, they real low
Prossies on the corner with the fuckin high heels on
Pick 'em up, drop 'em off, yeah they ride real strong
Crack addicts lookin for other addicts to steal from
Walkin round wonderin where they get they next meal from
Cokeheads on the red sniffin up their wages
Dealers on speed dial, suckin all their papers
Still under same number that they've had for fuckin ages
SIM card so old, the logo's fuckin faded
But turn it over and you see the gold nugget
Reflectin off the light that shines down above it
Unregistered chip, you gotta love it
Pay as you go, so the feds don't bug it
Twitter for the streets, if you want tweets
11 little digits and the blow is all you need
Tell me what's your poison, they got everything from weed
Up to metamphetamine, everybody follow me
And join up to their anti-social network
Database of smack, coke and crack-smokin experts
Without it they go out of business and no longer get work
So anybody tryina fuck with is gonna get hurt

Lyrical narrator, social commentator
Socially commentatin, what I say's verbatim
Verbal stipulator, oral illustrator
Orally illustratin what I'm stipulatin

Are you sittin comfortably?
Well, put your seatbelts on
Cause you're in for a harrowin ride
Cause this is Ill Manors where dark shit goes on at night
I am the narrator
The voice that guides the blind
Follow me not with your ears, but your mind
And alow me to take you back and forth through time
To explain the significance of things you may think are insignificant now
But won't... further down the line</pre>
