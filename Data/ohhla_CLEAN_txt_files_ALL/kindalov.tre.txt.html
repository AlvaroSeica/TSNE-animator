[Trey Songz]
Ladadadadada
Whoaaaahh
Let me explain the way your love has got me feeling
I'm willing to throw away and hang up all the pimpin
I'm ready to let go of my heart
And give it all to you
For the rest of my life
It's like I cant roll or go with no-one else but you babe
No body else can make me feel this way but you may
Be the only one I trust and baby that's what's up
I'm gonna tell the world about it
I'm gonna scream and shout it

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Girl you got that
Good kinda (good kinda)
Sweet kinda (deep kinda)
Loving
And girl you got that
Yeah baby
Oh baby
Keep it right there
I love it
Kinda lovin

[Trey Songz]
If you were music then you know I'd be the speaker
And if I was smoking then you know
You'd be the reefer
And if I was standing on the block
I'd keep you in my sock
And that's for real
Girl I can't see myself with no one else but you babe
No body else can make me feel this way but you may
Be the only one I love and baby that's what's up
I'm gonna tell the world about it
I'm gonna scream and shout it

[Chorus]

[Trey Songz]
And I'll love you 'til ain't no lovin' better
Baby you the best
Love you girl to death
And you can take my heart right out my hands
God forever planned
Got to be your man
So you ain't gotta worry bout this here
Girl I'll make it clear
Long as love is near
You gone be alright
Some kind of lovin so right

[Chorus]</pre>
