put the phone on ya but it's the booty call
and I'm comin' ta bust nuts on all ya'll
and I'm out
half a blunt hangin' out my mouth
speedin' like a demon on 101 south
I smoke chewy like a muthafuckin' nut
ya got a gram bag get the zags an' roll 'er up
it's Andre Nickatina tiger comin' out the cuts
maximum speed drivin' I don't give a fuck
garcia blunt fully hunt down the cat
these bitches on the street muthafucka were you at
dippin' on swayze wit my niggas from tha set
the blunt went out but we ain't done yet
get another one blaze
bitch get paid
a welfare that check every 15 days
i remember highschool lowfuel and bushy
cuttin' that muthafucka go gettin' pussy
caught up in the madness
this freak was the baddest
I seen her baggy jeans and her ass was the fattest
ooh it's jenine
she licked my dick clean
come right away she got a twomp sac of weed
nigga I'm sippin
my potna's got the tay' stay sippin'
talkin about money,hoes,hustlin' and pimpin'
I'm over
doja like this fine bitch
shinin' like a car or my news stands smith
cut the fade
hoes get wet from the wave 
dancin' in a cage with ass for days
it's like this
I didn't know you smoke chewy bitch
now bring the yale too so we can fire up a spliff
about six
my pager's talkin' to me sayin' "shit
the battery's low in this son of a bitch"
yeah 15's pound like this
15's screamin' out bitch
15's bumpin' gangsta shit
mind on a muthafuckin' grip
(shaggie)
a nigga graped his coat when I heard them 15"s
with a new 9 in the waistline of them jeans when I them 15"s
heard them 15's
grab my weed to get keyed when I heard them 15's
fresh out the house about to pop my p's
my niggas done swoop me up about twelve fifteen
what's the first thing to do but find that weed
in that sedan de ville cadilac wit' the gangsta lean
I gots to pop me a not
soon as we hit the spot
so I can hit the ho twice and see how much cash she got
me and 'dre will hop out
when we hit the parking lot
and get to flossin' on them fools like i pooled up at the postop
jumped out the car and we was feelin' like g's
I was broke that day but lookin' like I slang keys
but these hoes will neva know
cuz them ones will have you fat
when you off in one of them clubs and  dressing all in black
and it was cool I had juice to get in with a strap
in case I see one of them niggas from back in the days I done jact
in fact
my nigga shot done served that nigga a sac
and told me that he had 3 mo' niggas posted out back
bring this on
cuz right by the back door is my cuzin tone
and mr. blunt
ready to give some nike reading lessons to a chump
we make them bleed
then leave the seen
wit them a.r. 15's
a.r. 15's
(andre nickatina)
man I don't drink cappacino
I'm a picses not a leo
can't even strike to reno unless I tell my fuckin' p.o.
drinkin pina colata brooms staring hard at the moon
on the eightteenth floor hopin' I can find my room
five star
adictive like liquor at the bar
I sell tapes nigga bring it on cash or master charge
I gets lower than a den when I'm strikin" on a mission
lookin' for competition
or maybe a couple bitches
my style is something deadly like a newport cigarette
I'm a street chemist bitch
a money hungry pit
like daffey duck I gives a fuck
it's mines it's all mines
catch a flight in hienz
cuz I'll leave that ass behind
come stick with me
I'll bumble like a bee
cuz my boo
we was cool
back in nine two
but check it
I hit the party and these niggas holdin weed
and i hold it in at my heart and don't wanna leave
yeah what I think not
ya know we hate cops
imagine if nigga bought
every donut shop
in the city
fuck it in the muthafuckin' world
greesy like a curl
priceless like a pearl
strikin' like a lighter
bitin' like a biter
bitch did you recognize my whitewall tires?
(shaggy)
yeah man i recognize your whitewall tires, but we got to get this over with 
you understand me. I'm makein' moves I can't be standing around it might have 
been a good day for you,but I'm a tell you it'll never be right.

I stepped outside and I was tweaking
so tipsy mentally geekin'
I seen my nephew he had just got plug
he gave me credit he hooked me up with a proper dubb
here come my girl I hope she got a pipe
it might of been a good day for you,but for me it'll never be right
I must have been geekin' and I stole my mama's t.v.
now my little brother and my nephew wanna see me
but I ain't lookin' for them,I lookin' for a triple beam
and I'll be back later on cuz I heard you niggas got ice cream
something fat never that soda
fuckin wit the mexicans ya'll be havin' that peruvian yola
strait butt naked a dobe fiends dream
nextellin' ain't no tellin' when I put it on a triple beam
I love that bitch if ya know what I mean
but I ain't talkin' bout that skanless,I'm talkin bout that icecream</pre>
