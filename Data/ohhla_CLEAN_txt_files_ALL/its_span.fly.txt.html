A.K.A. Maniac for those who don't know

[O.G. Spanish Fly]
What's up, listen
Let me take this little chance
To grab the microphone 
And pull a cuete out my pants
Spanish fly gettin high
With the homies cant you see
Now what the fuck you putos 
Wanna player hate on me
Is it the rappin
The mic i be attackin
With some weed and hennisse
Manaic will be to mackin
Boy don't even trip
Bustin rounds out come slugs
My homies is deep I'm with a clika full of thugs
Mi fuckin mi killin mi love livin
With total devotion to rappin and millions
Is how we live in the 619 I thought you knew
Well bitch don't trip let me bust my flows
Maniac a.k.a Spanish Fly you ho
 
[Chorus]
It..... It's Spanish Fly, It's Spanish Fly
[2x]
 
[O.G. Spanish Fly]
Woke up, jumped out my bed
I gotta take a shower but primero shave my head
The party's down the street with some freaks of the week
The microphone is open for discussion let me speak
Pullin into the parking lot a friendly type of kill
The homies pitchin in now what you wanna do
A twenty pack of bud a case of thirty twos
A bottle of bacardi and a case to smooth
The jam is Spanish Fly, he's opinion cause I'm strapped
Chillin wit the homies cause the homies always got my back
Do Wa Diddy in a bitches titty then I'm out
I got the shit that makes the bitches wanna scream and shout
Yap Maniac, gun hoe you know
I'm chillin wit the homie Royal T at the show
So what you wanna do fool how do you want some
I got the whole down knowin Ese you don't want none
It's like this and like that and like this and uh
I got my gat cocked back wit a clip an uh
I'm fully strapped wit my nine milly clip an uh
We on hit, Spanish Fly is the shit but uh
I gotta go
 
[Chorus]
 
[O.G. Spanish Fly]
Verse number 3, to the streets for me
O.G. Spanish Fly getting high THC
You never heard my shit before
Just bob your head and listen 
Now Maniac from Diego town just mobbin on a mision
Rollin hella deep better watch as we creep
You'll catch Low Pro at the Wharehouse or the Swaptmeet
Bump it in your car as you role down the boulavard
Watch the cops try to trip and catch me 
Fuck that it's hella hard, you know
Forever busted, empty my clip for every gun
And everybody and their momma's runnin
So don't even trip Ese
That's how we do it on the streets
I play to win and I'll say it again
Now pour another cup of gin
Mix it wit some juice
What the fuck you pullin out on me a duece duece
Fuck that
