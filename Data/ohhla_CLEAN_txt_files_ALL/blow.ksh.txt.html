[Intro]
{*giggling*} Dance!

[Ke$ha]
Back door cracked we don't need a key
We get in for free, no VIP sleaze
Drink that Kool-Aid follow my lead
Now you're one of us, you're comin with me
It's time to kill the lights and shut the DJ down (this place about to)
Tonight were taking over, no one's getting out (this place about to)

[Chorus]
Blow {*-oh repeats*} blow {*-oh repeats*}
This place about to blow {*-oh repeats*} blow {*-oh repeats*}
This place about to blow {*-oh repeats*} blow {*-oh repeats*}
This place about to blow {*-oh repeats*} blow {*-oh repeats*}
This place about to..

[Ke$ha]
Now what? (What?) We're taking control
We get what we want, we do what you don't
Dirt and glit-ter cover the floor
We're pretty and sick, we're young and we're bored
It's time to lose your mind and let the crazy out (this place about to)
Tonight we're takin names, cause we don't mess around (this place about to)

[Chorus]

[Ke$ha]
Go, go, go
Go insane, go insane
Throw some glitter, make it rain on him
Let me see them Hanes, let me, let me see them Hanes
Go insane, go insane
Throw some glitter, kake it rain on him
Let me see them Hanes, let me, let me see them Hanes (c'mon)
We are taking, over (blow)
Get used to it, over (blow)
This place about to

[Chorus]</pre>
