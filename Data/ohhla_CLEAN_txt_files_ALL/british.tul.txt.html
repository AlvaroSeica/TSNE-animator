Bad man on the corner
Uh
Nines
Bad man on the corner
Female boss
British Swag

Bad man on the corner
Saying shorty come on over
Bring your body little closer
Cause I want to get to know ya

Yo my name's Tulisa and I come from London town
From Manchester to north Weezy baby, I'll show you around
Got links in every city, introduce you to my pals
Go with some British gangstas, show ya how do we get down

The more we rock together
We'll never, no no no we'll never stop
I'm all about my dollars
But I specialize in pounds, special specialize in pounds

I know you love my accent darling
I got that British British swag, that British British swag
I'll take you right into the top of the morning
I got that British British swag, that British British swag

Yea I know you recollect why I'm down
But guess what, baby baby me too
Now I'm thinking we should be me and you
I got that British British swag, I got that British British swag

Bad man on the corner
Saying shorty come on over
Bring your body little closer
Cause I want to get to know ya

Listen to our little garage, know that dubstep is our sound
We love a little bashment but you winding to the ground
I throwed you cups of tea but take the Henny straight down
Cause I'm the female boss, that's how I do when I'm in town

The more we rock together
We'll never, no no no we'll never stop
I'm all about my dollars
But I specialize in pounds, special specialize in pounds

I know you love my accent darling
I got that British British swag, that British British swag
I'll take you right into the top of the morning
I got that British British swag, that British British swag

Yea I know you recollect why I'm down
But guess what, baby baby me too
Now I'm thinking we should be me and you
I got that British British swag, I got that British British swag

British boy swag, I'm flyer than a space cadet
Nothing can't change, I'm gonna beat but I ain't need it yet
Still in the hood moving shhhh but I don't break a sweat
Looking like I'm sprung to buy a Nike the way I change my prayer at night
Time you think I had to do, the way I spend peace
Go to selfages, blow it quick, 10 G's
I know you love my accent, the balls of ether
I got 30k on my neck, offs Tulisa uh

I know you love my accent darling
I got that British British swag, that British British swag
I'll take you right into the top of the morning
I got that British British swag, that British British swag

Yea I know you recollect why I'm down
But guess what, baby baby me too
Now I'm thinking we should be me and you
I got that British British swag, I got that British British swag

Swag
