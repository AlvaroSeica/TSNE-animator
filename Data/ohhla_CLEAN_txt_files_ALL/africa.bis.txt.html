[Verse One]
It's been day too long, the sun is tired
Sunlight shift/night shift, the moon is higher
That's when them-when them b-b-b-boys hit the streets streets
Ridin' somethin' slow, real low, trunk full of beats
Boom boom boom boom boom boom
Boomin' like a tribal dance
See my comin' down that hill movin' like an avalanche
But m-m-much colder
Oh so below zero, flow so ice man/Ice Man, folks think I'm a super hero
It's just so silly cause really I'm a super villain
Coupe Devillain Coupe, roof a toupee, remove the ceilin'
Crunk willin', I'm feelin' so so (fresh)
I'm so church you can call me (blessed)
God damn man, the game's lame, time to change it
Number two, deja vu, fools drop the same shit
On a mission like a special agent to rearrange it
Still rappin', get the clubs packed like a slave ship
 
[Chorus]
I-I-I-I'm feelin' like Chaka
I gotta gotta gotta big spear in my boxers
Girl get down, get lower baby your ?
Soon after ya, attackin' ya, takin' you back to Africa [echo]
 
[Verse Two]
I'm feelin' like Chaka
Run around, half naked, big spear in my boxers
I'm about to set it, cast the spell like witchdoctors
Like I blew pimp dust in her face
Got her captivated, activated, wanna come to my place [echo]
Common gon' be mad at me [echo] (why?)
Common gon' be mad at me [echo] (why?)
Cause I likes them white girl
Had a little fever since Madonna, +Material World+
When I finda ? Tonya, let's make a chocolate swirl
G-G-G-Gringo come get Mandingo
Sisters don't trip, don't trip, don't be hatin' me
We just makin' up for slavery
Gosh, you know how them haters be
Hate to see you and me makin' any type improvement
In these streets avoid beef cause we deep like the Civil Rights Movement
 
[Chorus]
I-I-I-I'm feelin' like Chaka
I gotta gotta gotta big spear in my boxers
Girl get down, get lower baby your ?
Soon after ya, attackin' ya, takin' you back to Africa [echo]
 
[Bridge]
It's time to get dirty like a virus
It's time to get dirty like a virus 
 
[Verse Three]
Come on now, break it down, show me how, let's get wild
Put it on me, snap ya, whip your tail like a crocodile
Come on now, break it down, show me how, let's get wild
Put it on me, snap ya, whip your tail like a crocodile
My thing in 'em swingin' like Pitfall Harry
Got you creamin' and screamin' like it's a library
Very scary how every canary fall in love and wanna marry
Me, but see, I'm Eric Benet, you Hallie Berry
 
[Chorus]
I-I-I-I'm feelin' like Chaka
I gotta gotta gotta big spear in my boxers
Girl get down, get lower baby your ?
Soon after ya, attackin' ya, takin' you back to Africa [echo]</pre>
