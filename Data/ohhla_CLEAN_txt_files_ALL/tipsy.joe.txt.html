[Intro - Joe Budden - talking]
This goes out to you (you, you)
This goes out to you (you, you)
This goes out to you and you and you
You know who you are

This goes out to you (you, you)
Ta ha, this goes out to you (you, you)
And you (and you)

[Verse 1 - Joe Budden]
Check it, baby, sweetie, lady, darling
It don't (what?), get no better than this
And I know, guys'll go to any measure to hit
But I hope, you don't use that as a measurin stick (uh)
They priorities is off, busy treasurin whips
I just like the opportunity of pleasurin miss
Since I never met another that get wetter than this
Anytime I'm on tour, you'll forever be missed (talk to her)
'Cause I knew she was a fantasy dream
Every Sunday all she worried about is her fantasy team
And anytime shorty speed past, in that E-Class
Body so sick, that I always want a tea bag
So I spend, hit a mall, maybe SoHo
'Cause how she blessed me, swore her jaw broke though
Her sex to me's like a midnight ecstasy
So the bar could be closed as long as she next to me

[Chorus - Emanny &amp; Jay Townsend] - w/ ad libs
Baby I'm tipsy, so let's stay love drunk
Baby I'm tipsy, so let's stay love drunk
Ooh baby I'm tipsy, so let's stay love drunk
Let's stay love drunk, let's stay love drunk

See baby I'm tipsy, so let's stay love drunk
Baby I'm tipsy, so let's stay love drunk
Ooh baby I'm tipsy for you, yeah, so let's stay love drunk
Let's stay love drunk, let's stay love drunk

[Verse 2 - Joe Budden]
Check me out now, check it, see the beauty of it all is (what?)
We could both have whoever we please but um
We'd only be foolin ourselves (why?)
'Cause it seems without each other we would never be pleased
It's much more than her body though I value her waist
See shorty knows the value of space, she don't crowd me (nah)
Open-minded, know she don't got all the answers
When we hit the strip club, she tippin all the dancers
I'm tryin to show you things that you ain't used to (uh)
Talkin waterfront villas out in Saint Lucia (uh)
Turn our cells off, nothin else matters
Took it slow but it couldn't of happened any faster (faster)
See she don't go through the phone (uh)
She say if that's necessary than she'd rather be alone
Can tell she for real by the sound of her tone
Shorty grown, no chaser, she got me in the zone

[Chorus] - w/ ad libs

[Verse 3 - Joe Budden]
Uh, best part about it all, it's not difficult
You such a standout, nowhere near typical
Plus you let me be my own individual
You know if you support me, you'll get every residual
And when girls try to tell you that I'm cheatin (what?)
You agree sayin they don't know the half (why?)
'Cause how I got shorty, it ain't even fair
Know it all adds up, they can't seem to do the math (nah)

[Break - Emanny]
No Henn' or glass of Rosé (Rosé)
Could make my world spin around just like you do
They just don't taste the same
Got me buzzed off the love you gave (ya gave)
No way I see straight after one sip from you, oh

[Chorus] - w/ ad libs until the end</pre>
