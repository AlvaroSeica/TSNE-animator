[Talib Kweli] + {Sample}
{In this world} This that feeling
{What's happening to love?} It's that feeling you miss
{I'd like to know} It's that love, it's that passion
Tone, they don't get shit like this no more, yeah
Reflection, aiyyo

Welcome to my longitude and latitude, my attitude
is shaping my surroundings, skyscrapers, public housing
The sheep is running from the sun, the wolves is howling at the moon
It's tragic how you in the street cause you ain't got no avenues
When it come to rapping who's the baddest dude? {In this world}
You still don't get it
This a recession, what recession? Dog, we been stressing
Shit been a mess and we been dealing with this depression since
way back, but you ain't got to say that, that's the greatest lesson
Slave to our possession, greed the devil favorite weapon
Fight to the death, only the greatest left {In this world}
Let's get it

[Chorus: Sample] + (Talib Kweli)
Lordy, Lordy, Lordy Lord (let's get it, let's get it)
I been hustling really, really hard (yes)
Get up off my ass, start making some moves (come on)
Put two and two together, start paying my dues
I got to get up for it, stand up in this world

"If skills sold truth be told, I'd probably be
 Lyrically, Talib Kweli" - Jay-Z

[Talib Kweli]
I get respected by the best emcees {In this world}
The recipe for my success is
One part pain and suffering, two parts brains and hustling
Sprinkle it over Hi-Tek production
We bubbling like volcanic eruptions, you better buckle in
Push the panic button, come get your mama to tuck you in
You know we did like no other did it {In this world}
You gots to get with it

[Sample]
In this world
What's happening to love?
I'd like to know

[Chorus]

[Talib Kweli]
Aiyyo, I grab the mic until my hands develop the calluses
My style is bit, I only see myself with John Malkovich
My grind miraculous, rhyme from slums to palaces
Facing all my challengers, raising the black power fist
Here to eliminate the counterfeit {In this world}
Add it up, it don't amount to shit
I paid my dues, kept the receipt for taxes
Although we stack it we stay stuck in the bracket
It's like a straitjacket
My rebel tactics got the planet spinning off it's axis
The devil laughing when you lazy, man get off your ass and
talent don't mean nothing without all the practice {In this world}

[Chorus]</pre>
