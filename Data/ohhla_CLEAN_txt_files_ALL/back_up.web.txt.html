Trill Entertainment nigga mic check, Webbie and Boosie
Ya heard me, this how its goin down nigga, check it out
Back up bitch, back up bitch, back up
C'mon, trill entertainment
Yo hood can't fuck with mine

[WEBBIE]
Now I know, that you ain't really bout that shit that you be talkin about
And you be just runnin ya mouth but you'll get knocked out 
drug out the club house
Showin up with yo thugs, me and my thugs'll make yo thugs bounce
I, suggest that you respect it
disrespect I'll have to check it and when I check it gets hectic
You don't want no savage doin no damage to yo section
while I fuckk yo babymama she say fuck my babydaddy
If a nigga wants some static let'em have thats the G-Code 
since 94' I been throwed up in beast mode
Street life is all I know, sellin yo money, cars and clothes
run for real don't fuck with hoes, unload and reload
We G's y'all hoes, y'all ain't ready to swang with us, since
youngstas growin up y'all people wouldn't let y'all hang with us
Yo people prolly 'dont play with guns boy they dangerous', my
peeps don't play with guns they stay with guns and I slang'em

[CHORUS]

Now when I enter this bitch I was ready to get off in my some
shit, cause I love my hood and I'ma represent in this bitch
Now in the parkin lot, I had that for glock ready that jig goin
keep me hype when I be watchin over Webbie
In my city A.P. glocks and Smith and Weston, thugs who be
second guessin them the ones who be restin
God gave me a blessin, told me get the croud crunk, say Boo
dont change yo style give the croud what they want (look)
Now I'm that rumble in the jungle 2004 Hummer stunna, my momma
she still wonder why her sons a young gunner
Back back, back back, get out my way let me mob, all that
poppin in a nigga played out in 95'

I see y'all actin nigga, oh yeah y'all act a fool, betta stop
that actin lil savage'll beat you black and blue
I been abused you gotta excuse my attitude, plus I been smokin
Hy-dro and drinkin yak and bruise
I been a fool out here packin tools since middle school
I been a fool I had the most lud up in the school, a phonebook
a referrals I ain't follow no rules
Be quite in class, don't act back and raise ya hands was old rules
I skipped the class act the ass and sold some crack to white dudes
Between class smoked Kools and big blunts before school
Straight up, many niggaz glad I ain't go to your school, played
them hoes I woulda played you like a hoe too
Thats tat boy I don't, he start fights errywhere he goes to 
but proudly I don't give a fuck, try me I'll fight you
Hold up back up a bit you fuckin up my white shoes, alright I
ask you once, BITCH MOVE!
