[DJ Quik]
How come y'all niggaz bitter? Hatin so much
You wanna be up in my hair but you can't clean your brush
Should evaporate, you just exacerbate
What makes my sex life great and you gotta masturbate
Your hair is fallin out, my hair is growin in
I put my hair in curls and put yours in the garbage bin
Then play piano on stage live when I rhyme
And you niggaz can't even bounce and rap on time (I think I got it!)
I bet Eazy-E is turnin over in his grave
to see that some of y'all done made gangsta rap gay
(GAY~!) I got a brand new HK
and I sniper practice each and every day {*sniper shot*}
(Okay!) My momma's conversations on the phone short with me
(Mother..) I think she wants to have a heart-to-heart with me
I told her I would kill you niggaz smartfully
I'm the star player, you can't start from me

[Chorus]
Play that Quik shit, it get 'em all sparked
Everywhere from La' Park down to Carver Park
I keep it avenue, I'm bringin brothers hope
Liquid change colors, it's that killer dope
The street never changes, only faces do
Every something years, it replaces you
I get the people loaded, when they can't cope
Put me on the burner, got that killer dope

[Interlude]
Killer, it's so... killer
It's so... killer, killer dope

[DJ Quik]
I be all precision like the Temptations men
Before Paul Williams' replacement stint
or rehabilitation, what the name is..
My drinking situation is the same as his
Attention deficit cause I don't pay you none
I got the word before you came in, they say you done
Tryna fix your pockets with some broken tools
You run a broken school, full of broken fools
..Now g'on and clean out ya desk
Take your name plaque with you while they clean out the rest
I'm the new executive movement, I'm beatin my chest
and I'm a mess... I digress
that I'm too mature for the job I got, too young for the job I want
2-1 when my cars go flop, give all my homeboys a blunt
Cause the point is two spliffs are double-jointed
Now let's all go get high on my enemies' supply

[Chorus]

[Interlude]
And it's killer, killer
Got that killer dope
It's so killer, it's so killer, it's so killer..

[DJ Quik]
I gotta be simply ONE of the greatest, ONE of the hardest
One of the smartest, one of the brightest
One of the ones who helped start all this
Some niggaz eatin simply because I chose to be an artist
Way back when, I was homeless, way back when, I was carless
Way back when, my sisters used to kick me out they apartments
They back with they hands out, but they made me so heartless
I don't even put cans out, I ain't tryna donate
I ain't givin you bitches loans, this ainÂ’t no fuckin bank!
I ain't no house nigga, like {*censored*}
If this is UAC music then WHAT makes it so awful?
I'm back with the strap in my lap, I'm back in the hood with the gat
I'm back with the drink in my trunk, don't think so I'll drink 'til I'm drunk
I'm back in the kitchen, slow roastin a lesson
And I play my own piano, don't call y'all for no sessions
I'm a threat and a blessing, known to keep cowards stressing
While I'm relaxing at the shooting range releasing aggression
Now tell me how you want it

[Chorus]

[Interlude]
It's killer, killer, killer
My shit killer
My shit is killer, killer, killer
It's so killer
My shit is killer, killer, killer
So killer
Shit killer, killer, killer
So killer

[Outro]
Shouts goes out, to myself
I love me, DJ Quik!
