Let the bass make your spine jerk, drums make your ears hurt
Hear me deliverin' this phat ass verse, been puttin' in work
Eventually I'll master the craft and sit back
grab the phone and tell the boss to kiss my ass
You won't see me in the mornin', 8 o'clock on the button
I'll be on the lake fishin', blazin' fire with my cousin
(THAT'S IT) As I become one with the fish
Collect my thoughts for a bit until I'm ready to spit
Pick up my celly and shit, then proceed to hit up my kids
and connect 'em voice dialed through sprint
I tell 'em meet me at the spot with some hot ish
They say 'Jimmy you got lyrics?', SON I GOT THIS!!
Continuously the past two days kid I been writin'
Had to polish my game to make the stage show excitin'
It's frightenin', while y'all hang loose we keep it tightened
Y'all talk like thunder, we show and prove like lightnin' 
Aight then, why you always hatin' on me?
I'm doin' my thing on stage, I make the crowds move for free
I ain't getting' paid nothin', so why you frontin'?
With all that hard talkin' you're about to start something
You don't really wanna get into
I'll disassemble your nose, and possibly puncture a lung too
With a one then a two combination you're through
Blows from my Timberland boots leave you bruised like bad fruit
(SO WHAT IT LOOK LIKE) I might be white, but I still possess the skills
To rip mic's, when I'm sober, when I'm schwilled I keep it real
With my vocabulary spills I'm ill, like L, with lyrical skill
Like Hyundai cause I Accel
Whack competitors get whaced if their style's an act
It's been a long time but I'm back on the GCH track
I speak on fact while most of y'all cat's be preachin' fiction
The way you rhyme and live in life's a contradiction
You need to listen closely to the words I speak
Also get accustomed used to the word defeat
Bless beats like a Roman priest from dusk 'til dawn
My written flow be holy water, I spray shit 'til your gone..

Extra, Extra...Read all about it
You takin' us out kid, haha, I highly doubt it
When live wires connect they cause a surge
That electrocutes your ears the illest shit you ever heard
Extra, Extra...Read all about it
You takin' us out kid, haha I doubt it
When live wires connect they cause a surge
That electrocutes your ears the illest shit you ever heard

Ring the alarm, cause Travie Won is shining
Ring the alarm, cause I've begun refining
Ring the alarm, cause GCH is coming
Ring the alarm, and hear the drummer drumming

Ring Ring the alarm, bring it back to react and respond
I'll Pierce your teflon vest with Double O's like James Bond
Me say 'Mon, it be no problem', like a Jamaican
You ought never to try and compare this to you because you fakin'
(BUM-BA-CLAHT) You must have been so severely mistaken
If Hip-Hop today's a yard full of leaves, its time for rakin'
Ain't no time for playin', pay attention to these words I'm sayin'
Cause these might be the feet which to whom you will be prayin'
Verbal slayin', the last be first, first shall be last
In like 2 point 5 I get medieval on your ass
Play on the grass, but you know you're bound to step in doo-doo
Never no need to front, cause we don't be frontin' like you do
On some real shit, you don't wanna do nothin' now do you?
So screw you, we're true warriors like Shaka Zulu
With that juice, not like Tupac's Bishop but Desmond Tutu
And there you have it, most of y'all be quick to speak on Travis
Not even knowin' the full capabilities of his madness
You thought you had this, when you can't even come near me
In fact just you thinking that shit is kinda scary
I'm leavin' heads Gratefully Dead like Jerry

Everything's in the process, mad stress no rest
You could test but you'll never ever penetrate this lyrical crest
I'm armor, you'll get slapped with this fat rosey palm
Ask your mama, about that last soap opera drama
Son I'm wicked, do you want a first class ticket
To a beatin', show your ass and I'm inclined to kick it
Keep it real, that's just another bum ass deal
Sometimes I feel it makes me get a little crazy like seal
But I'm survivin', ain't drivin' cause I just got my license
All I got to my name is lint, a Herkimer diamond, and 79 cents
And a mountain bike that's just about as broke as my pockets
I'm broke to the point that I'm about to pull my own eye sockets
But there's more to life than just them new Jordan's, and right now
I'm rockin' anything my Dad's affordin', I come complete
Whole like Vitamin D, while cat's just Skim the surface
If 2% is real the other 98 is nervous
Open your eyes, take off them shades you ain't the secret service
Don't be surprised, realize that 'No disguise' can hide your worthless
I've tried and cried a million times to find my sole purpose
I've tried and cried a million times to find my soul purpose</pre>
