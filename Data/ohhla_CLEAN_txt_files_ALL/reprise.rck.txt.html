[Intro: Pimp C sample]
{"M-M-M-M"} "A little over a year ago I was in bondage
and now I'm back out here, reapin' the blessings and gettin' the benefits that go along with it
Everything that's out here for kings like us.
The reason why we like this, this jewelry and this diamonds and stuff
They don't understand is, because we really from Africa {"M-M-M-M"}
and that's where all this stuff come from. And we originated from kings, you know what I'm sayin'?
So don't look down on the youngsters because they wanna have shiny things.
It's in our genes, know what I'm sayin'? We just don't all know our history
so.. peace to the Midwest. Keep it P-I, you know what I'm sayin'?"

[Rick Ross]
I'mma just keep you up on this pimp shit, see what I'm sayin'? {"M-M-M-M"}

I just landed in Europe, nigga
Shopping bags, I'm a tourist, nigga
Money talk I speak fluent, nigga
Reeboks on, I just do it, nigga
Look at me, I'm pure nigga
I bet the hoes on my tour, nigga
I don't bop, I do the money dance
My bitch whip cost a hundred grand
Red vert, you see me slide
Sexy bitch I hope she 'bout it
Sexy bitch I know she 'bout it
Fuck with me, you know I got it

[Chorus 2X: Rick Ross]
Fuck with me, you know I got it
Fuck with me, you know I got it
Sexy bitch I hope she 'bout it
Come fuck with me, you know I got it

[Rick Ross]
My smoke thick, my jewels gold
My shoes new, these hoes chose
My pistol works, my looks kill
Bitch text me, her rent here
Unfortunately I'm a pimp, baby
Couldn't care less 'bout your rent, lady
I got a chopper that's a bit crazy
Balenciaga boots, I'm in the Bent faded
Peelin' paper like a bank teller
Me and Hova in the bank, hella
Paper cuts until you hate, cheddar
I take that back cause I am straight, cheddar!

[Chorus]

[Rick Ross]
40 racks, front, pocket
I bet 40 racks them folks, watchin'
I bet 40 racks them hoes, want me
I got 40 racks, these hoes, on me
40 rounds, that thang, on me
Fuck around, my bang, on me
Cell phone got 40 hoes
A-game give me 40 more
Her number keep on poppin' up
She came through, the topic was to top me up
Top down in my white Corniche
Ever see these HermÃ¨s seats?

[Chorus]

[Rick Ross]
I'm ridin' big comin' down that beach
Geechi nigga with satin sheets
Bad bitch, she a MASTERPIECE~!!
Got a bad bitch, she a masterpiece
