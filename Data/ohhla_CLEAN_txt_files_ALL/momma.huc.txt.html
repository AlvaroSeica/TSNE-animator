Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro: Nicole Wray]
I love you momma, love you momma, love you momma
love you momma, love you momma, love you momma, ayyy

[Chorus: Hurricane Chris]
Momma I just wanna take the time out to say
that if it wasn't for you I wouldn't be here today
and I apoligize for all the times I made you cry
and all the times I made you hate and momma I just wanna say
that everything I do I did for you
my daddy and the rest of the family
momma you know I love you and everything I do I did for you
my daddy and the rest of the family
momma you know I love you

[Verse: Hurricane Chris]
Momma I just wanna take the time out to say
ain't no way I can forget what you did for me no way
you raised me from a baby and plus I know I was bad
so no women on earth could ever take your place and that's a fact
I remember when you use to have to come sit in my class
cause I ain't know how to act thank you for beating my ass
that's why I know how to act every morning I woke up
there was a meal on my plate but I can see it in your face
you wasn't straight and you and my daddy went ya'll seperate ways
he stayed in my life just like he suppose to
that's why I say he a cheat see my momma love me
before I got my kids she told me what ever I turn out to be
just keep it real and I know she worried bout me too
momma I'm cool I got

[Chorus]

[Verse: Hurricane Chris]
Momma I apoligize for every virtue
for anything I ever did I ever said that hurt you
I had asthma when I was growing and I got real sick
you closed your eyes and prayed and cried more than a lil bit
my cousin had took me out and taught me how to mack
you hated when I hung wit him cause he be chasin cats
that broad fool but I never made no doubt in that
no matter what happend I knew my family had my back
and even though I'm out here living my life like I'm grown
everyday I pick up the phone and I call home
I say hey booy it's sean that boy
still trippin that boy crazy
and I wish I could be home with ya
I bet both of my grandmas in the kitchen
cookin food if it wasn't for them
I probaly wouldn't went to school
momma I love you in a way that I just can't explain
your only child Chris Dooley, Hurricane

[Chorus]

[Nicole Wray + Hurricane Chris]
Said you know I need you in my life
said you know your the only one I need in my life
my daddy the rest of the family
momma you know I love you and everything I do
I did for you my daddy and the rest of the family
momma you know I love you</pre>
