[Chorus]
As the room spins the boom within
Triggers to lungs to begin
So it's on again
Tell me, do you hear what I hear?
"Louder, louder, louder"

[Verse One] [Finsta]
Now who want what we got?
We rock from dungeons to rooftops
We chart while crews pop
Fuck your case history and keep your stay short
This our way of life, see we nicer than you thought
Perhaps if we had picture cards
To help you figure
You wouldn't discard mad shit that we deliver
My mind travel, like platinum artists thirsty for the cheddar
They don't know, see we came to train them better
Then those who oppose this righteous mad militia
Keep foes on their toes, assemble like artisti-
-Crats
King upon horseback, crown attack
F.B., forever hit you with that phat-
-Ness
+Payday Is Bliss+
Why I'm livin'
Idiots walk around just like this shit is givin'
To anyone
Every time I see the sun
'Nuff praise and hope I live to see another one
Before I go
I hope to blow like a bitch
Can't take the stress, too many fraud niggas rich
Not only that
You see, they fuckin' with my music
And I'm not included while they fuckin' up my music

[Chorus] [x2]
As the room spins the boom within
Triggers to lungs to begin
So it's on again
Tell me, do you hear what I hear?
"Louder, louder, louder"

[Verse Two] [Bundy]
Lyrics ferocious so check for dosage
Can't have overdosin' on views we composin'
Too many heads don't be knowin'
So every word's chosen
To melt the frozen that be dosin' off while they posin'
If you feel it then you're ready for the motion
This ain't for play
Fruits of life we bestoyin'
While others chase the glow in that drink 
Until they droven by material that's woven by humans
Yo man, who you jokin'?
See we transmit to the masses
Surpassin' the asses that are fiends for the cash
You know that don't last
But Finsta Bundy paragraphs 
Breaks niggas ass from the Bush to Bangladash

[Chorus] [x2]
As the room spins the boom within
Triggers to lungs to begin
So it's on again
Tell me, do you hear what I hear?
"Louder, louder, louder"

[Verse Three] [Bundy]
Some ask, "Who this?"
Wait a minute we been through this
So why must I come down like a Brutus

[Finsta]
Now when we bless this
Piece of papyrus
Niggas won't laugh at this
We some of the nicest
Kids with precise shit
That we suffice with
We keep your mental lit
Like that boom shit
So when we comin' down
Best to know the odds fuckin' with this odd couple
Right this way is far from subtle
Quick to take the head of a violator of the tribe
It's nothing personal, I just can't take the lies
Trickery
And mystery we deal with facts
Bitches tryin' to make they way, layin' on they backs
Fuck that and anything similar
The shit we bringin' to
The table
Will enable my children to buy land and stables
We capable of uprootin'
Bad seeds whose recruitin'
The blinds to the ways of the wicked
They dyin' so we rip shit
Sometimes explicit

[Chorus] [x2]
As the room spins the boom within
Triggers to lungs to begin
So it's on again
Tell me, do you hear what I hear?
"Louder, louder, louder"

[Outro]
Finsta Bundy comin', niggas livin' in fear
Just hide your bitches, keep the tops on your beers
Keep it to yourself as I'm movin' this here

Finsta Bundy forever [x4]
Feel it [x4]</pre>
