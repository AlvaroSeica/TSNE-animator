[Intro: Sergio Pizzorno]
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh..
Ahhhh-AH-ahhhh-AH-ahhhh-AH-ahhhh-AH-ahhhhhhh..
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh..
Ahhhh-AH-ahhhh-AH-ahhhh-AH-ahhhh-AH-ahhhhhhh..

[Verse One: Tom Meighan] (Pizzorno)
Hey son, I'm looking forward
You're aiming backwards, of this I'm sure
Have you had enough? Are you feeling rough?
Does your skull hurt? Well if it's war
'Cause I'm taking back what's mine, I am taking back the time
You may call it suicide, but I'm being born again - I'm waiting!
(Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh..) I'm waiting
(Ahhhh-AH-ahhhh-AH-ahhhh-AH-ahhhh-AH-ahhhhhhh..)
Right here now, I'm waiting
(Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh..) For someone, or something
(Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh..) to take me, to take me over

[Chorus]
Daaaaaaaaays, the days are forgotten
Now it's all oveeeeeer, simply forgotten
How to disappear

[Verse Two: Tom Meighan] (Pizzorno)
Home bred, I've got blood lust
Feeding you bread crust, I leave no scar
You say I'm old hat, a fucking dirty rat
Call me a clich√©, how right you are
'Cause I am with the vagabonds
I am righting all your wrongs
You may call it suicide, but I'm being born again - I'm waiting!
(Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh..) I'm waiting
(Ahhhh-AH-ahhhh-AH-ahhhh-AH-ahhhh-AH-ahhhhhhh..)
Right here now, I'm waiting
(Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh..) For someone, or something
(Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh..) to take me, to take me over

[Chorus 2X]

{Z-Trip cuts and scratches}

[LL Cool J]
Uh.. uh! {Bring it back!}
Days are forgotten, look how you treat 'em (WAIT!)
Show your compassion, waitin to beat 'em (WAIT!)
Bomb in the station, waitin to meet 'em (WAIT!)
Nineteen burglars, waitin to greet 'em
Then come back again and take revenge
or end the whole thing with a tip of a syringe
Introverted outcast livin on the fringe
Chest poked out, it HURTS to pretend
Fallen and can't get up
Buy a razor blade, find somethin to cut
Half the man that he used to be
These are my cleats on your neck, get used to me (WAIT!)
Self-denial is the world's religion
Back to the pulpit, preachin to the rhythm
Ain't fuckin around, takin back what's mine
Days are forgotten, but not this time~! (WAIT!) {*echoes*}

[Chorus 2X]

[Bridge: Tom Meighan]
I saw something out there in the darkest star 
You were sat home, chewing on monkey brain..
I am not here I'm just a silhouette 
You will never ever ever forget

[Chorus 2X]

[Outro: Tom Meighan]
I saw something out there in the darkest star 
You were sat home, chewing on monkey brain</pre>
