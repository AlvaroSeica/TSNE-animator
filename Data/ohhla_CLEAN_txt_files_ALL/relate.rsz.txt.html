[Juju] {Psycho Les}
What what yo
Yeah yeah, you know what I'm saying
One time for your motherfucking mind
No doubt
Beatnuts {exclusive}, Rascalz collabo
Who want it? Who want it? {Rascalz}
Ju the german
You know what I'm saying
Niggas don't want it {Rascalz}
All my live niggas, with me?

[Juju] {Beatnuts}
I make my own price, murder your team with only one knife
Stabbed my ex-girl because she couldn't make me cum twice
{It's dumb right}
Same reason I like to gunfight, squeeze 'til I bleed
So if you coming better come right
{Drunk tank}
Living so foul I'll even jump Christ
Hendrix is between heaven and hell with no ice
Hunger and terrible times helped me to become nice
Fuckable, we all going to die, that's why I love life

[Psycho Les]
This is for my niggas from S.A. D.C.
And D.R. where we are, 'Nut is who we are
Fly off the FDR and take your spotlight and make it clear
You couldn't bring the party to life with CPR
Pass the mic and go set the VCR
So I can blow up the show and dissappear
With the baddest chicks with the fattest tits
I like to fuck, get drunk, smoke
Then I have them strip, with no problem
Big thighs, I'm so round them
I could lick them but can't stick them
With no condom, so where the hats at?
So I could smack that, back fat
Flip it and then tip it, take a nap nap
And that's that
And call it a night, the alcoholics is like
Still drinking, the pussy on the mind like Bill Clinton
I'm still killing... tracks flipping something new
Beatnuts and my niggas Rascalz

CHORUS [Beatnuts &amp; Rascalz]
Yo who said a nigga can't be great
If it ain't about a half million dollars
Then I can't relate
Always killing with the jams we make
Beatnuts and Rascalz yo, we going to snatch your plate
Yo who said a nigga can't be great
If it ain't about a half million dollars
Then I can't relate
Always killing with the jams we make
Beatnuts and Rascalz yo, we going to snatch your state

[Red 1] (Juju) {Psycho Les}
Yo, got you in a choke hold, messing with these cats who be loco
(Beatnuts and Rascalz shine like Acapulco)
Rhyme is no joke, yo don't want to be broke
So, I hold down the fort slanging Vancity hydro
Banging the eyes low, microphone pyro
When we blow 'cause we sip strange brew like nitro
And flamethrow, fire spitter ill lingo
Yo fuck the industry 'cause I don't mingle
Only wnat what I can keep, and a couple of freaks
You know dem big batty girls with the ill physics
Nymphoes ready to blow from head to toe
Get handled, dismantled from all angles
Let it tango because I dangle
Don one, I don't hit if it don't wear thongs
And I don't smoke shit if it ain't that Chron
Is you with it?
{Yeah, so just bring it}

[Misfit]
Yo who that is
Coming down like an avalanche, copping my b-boy stance
Rocking the jam in any circumstance
Take a glance, the swatch general will enhance
To set it off and hang you by the seat of your pants
So slam dance, and let the world feel the song
When we bumrush the set and take control of your dome
'Cause we fully blown, 4-tracks we busted at home
Now it's time for you to see the way we rip up the phone
Nice in the zone like G Rice, precise with my device
Taking this time out so you can think twice
Before the heist, before you pay the price
Before the rhyme piper come to snatch up your ice in your life
The assistant blaster, when you ducking from what has happened
We scrapping, stacking, never pause steady action
And keep it craking like flavoured whips in a porno flick
With my hombres, we tracks will make a killing

CHORUS

  **Laughter**
[Red 1] Vancity
[Misfit] That's how we do it
[Red 1] Collabo, Beatnuts and Rascalz
[Beatnuts] Beatnuts and Rascalz, we don't stop
[Misfit] Nobody do it like us yo
[Red 1] Holding it down
[Misfit] Nobody do it like us yo
[Red 1] Holding it down
[Misfit] Beatnuts and Rascalz y'all
         Forever forever
[Beatnuts] Beatnuts and Rascalz who don't stop
           It's the remedy to make your body rock
           Beatnuts and Rascalz who don't quit
           And when we stepping to New York we the ultimate
[Red 1] Beatnuts and Rascalz who don't stop
        The remedy to make your body rock
[Misfit] We the ultimate
         Only real niggas come like this
[Red 1] Word up to my man Kemo
        What's up Kemo</pre>
