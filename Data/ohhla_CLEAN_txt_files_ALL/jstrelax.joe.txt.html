Hoo

Your ears and your neck gotta glisten baby
And this is crazy
But this the way it's gotta be
Baby you're a queen
Plus I ain't fit to be a man
So the plan for me
It's to get the cheese
Bye any means

[Chorus: Joe]
Every things gonna be alright
So relax yourself baby
Please cycle  down
Relax yourself
Please cycle  down

It ain't nottin' nice
It ain't nottin' nice
It ain't nottin' nice now

Said it ain't nottin' nice now

It ain't nottin' nice
It ain't nottin' nice
It ain't nottin' nice now

And when we make it
I'm gonna fly you to the moon and back
Visit the stars
Yes you are 
(You are)
So beautiful to me
Beautiful as can be
Good God sent you to me
You're and angel
And I hope these streets don't take me
Down the wrong road we gonna make
Trust in love 'cause it's amazing
Yes it is
So please
Just trust in me 
Listen to me girl

[Chorus: Joe] {Dre}
Every things gonna be alright
So relax yourself baby
Please cycle  down
Relax yourself
Please cycle  down

It ain't nottin' nice

My loves the bomb
Girl you gotta put me on [x3]

My loves the bomb
Listen

I got one hand in the pot
Of the holding you tight
This life girl
You know it ain't right
But we live in it
Something we're fighting for
You know it ain't nice
It's why the chrome keep it
Nice for me killin shit
I do it for us
I pray the Lord forgive it shit
One day we be out the hood
God would that be nice

[Joe] {Dre}
It ain't nottin' nice
It ain't nottin' nice
{Say what?}
{I said it ain't nottin' nice}
It ain't nottin' nice now
{It ain't nottin' nice}

Said it ain't nottin' nice now

It ain't nottin' nice
It ain't nottin' nice
It ain't nottin' nice now
