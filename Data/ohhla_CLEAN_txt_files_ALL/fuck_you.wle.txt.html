Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1: Wale]
Uh, Yea
Yea, Uh

Real nigga pardon whoever feel different
Only feel sorry for crack babies and rape victims
Pushing my way to the top
But this time it feel different
DC ain't been this hot since Ronald Reagan made a killing

Ambition mixing liquor with life's lemons
Despite my dark days I feel I'm the brightest of thinkers
Frequently hated, either that or misunderstood
But a wise woman told me it's okay to know you're good

They call it arrogance
But I think it's passionate
And I think this happens when you rap and don't exaggerate
Shawty open your soul
Pray that protools agree though

Me and my pupils is mutual they not focused as me though
See my flow is the nicest
And my ho is the baddest
And the sex will lock her down see my stick is the gavel

Catalog growing, rappers skedaddle move over
She reluctantly fucking
She's an adamant blower

I'm a passionate poet
Moonlight as rapping Folarin
Horse is missing on my Polo cause my tag is enormous
I ain't cocky I'm just proud of me
So why these niggas acting like I ain't allowed to be

[Chorus: Wale]
Fuck you, when a nigga in the room give a nigga room
Nigga fuck you, yea just you
Tell them people we ain't leaving go adjust dude

Fuck you, when a nigga in the room give a nigga room
Nigga fuck you, yea just you
Tell them people we ain't leaving go adjust dude

[Verse 2: Wale]
Real nigga pardon whoever feel different
How I grow to be 5'8
But it's still my little niggas
Chanel slippers on my bitches like you go love
And I love your brain but I think I'll never know enough

Argue with twitter niggas who insignificant
But it's just simply my interest to intricately rid up you niggas
Proud of it all defensive fuck I'm rocking alone
Say what you want I'm Immature like Roger go home

Hard headed hot headed I admit it
But I'll be damned if they defeat me like a fucking prosthetic
Ha, Wale you so arrogant
Rozay told me break a leg no wonder why I care again

Stunting in a pair of Tiffs I DON'T mean a pair of Tims
Two bitches named Tiffany I left them with a pair of kids
Rare shit, trend setting yea I be the best
OD'd on that mission x he thought it was '03 again

Hold up yea we the best
Roll with Ace, Khaled and them
Roll up niggas be like sex
Don't you leave a seed in there

Reading shit my critics say
Pitchfork doesn't need a plate
Not hungry for my poetry
They fasting they won't leave me ate

Tricks and a half
Optimistic this isnt bad it's different now
Before the faith niggas was wam
Carelessly whispering all they nickel opinions at me

Tell all my haters call they neighbor get they minions at me
A couple labels threw some millions yet they still ain't grab me
Nigga's talk they'd attacked me but wouldn't steal a taxi
Ha, and I ain't smug I'm just proud of me
Why they acting like a nigga ain't allowed to be

[Chorus: Wale]
Fuck you, when a nigga in the room give a nigga room
Nigga fuck you, yea just you
Tell them people we ain't leaving go adjust dude

Fuck you, when a nigga in the room give a nigga room
Nigga fuck you, yea just you
Tell them people we ain't leaving go adjust dude

[Talking: Wale]
Ambition is definitely on the way
