(Verse 1)
The fall of Babylon was prophesized to come to pass
Messenger Elijah said there will be fire
This wicked city shall burn at last
And everyone shall return to his home
Each shall flee to his native home
Land for the wicked?  Man time is gone
You don't believe"  you shall see when the fire come
"Fire come," burning through your town
And ain't no water going to cool it down
And there is no place to run,
For, the time is Armagedd-eon


(Chorus)
Hear the science
"Hear the science!"
And the mathematics
"Hear the science!"
of the destruction
"Hear the science!"
in this holy Armagedd-eon

Aie!
Bun-bung de de boy, 
Bung-bung de de boy, bing bing
Bung-bung bing bung, wing dang
What a ding, 
What a dang
What a ding

Bun-bung de de boy, 
Bung-bung de de boy, bing bing
Bung-bung, bing bung, wing dang
What a ding, 
What a dang
What a ding

(Verse 2)
Elijah did tell ya of the great catastrophe
That shall fall upon America for the sin of slavery
You shall see the holy prophesies of Armageddon come to pass
When you hear the angel Gabriel blow the mighty trumpet blast,
Which will send vibrations all around
And everybody's going to hear the sound
The ultrasonic sound waves will be so strong, 
that they will crumple tall buildings down "to the ground!"
And there will be a message written in every language,
Saying "Hurry! Hurry!  
Everyone to his home, for the hour of destruction is now!"

(Chorus)
Hear the science
"Hear the science!"
And the mathematics
"Hear the science!"
of the destruction
"Hear the science!"
in this holy Armagedd-eon.

Bun-bung de de boy, 
Bung-bung de de boy, bing bing
Bung-bung bu-ding, wing dang
What a ding, 
What a dang
What a ding

Bun-bung de de boy, 
Bung-bung de de boy, bing bing
Bung-bung, bu-ding, wing dang
What a ding, 
What a dang
What a ding

(Verse 3)
Ezekiel had a vision of Allah n' his mother playing
And from out of this awesome will within the will 
is from where the angel Gabriel came
And there will be many more ships in doubt after the trumpet blast
And the job of the angels within these ships 
is the release of the poison gas,
which will kill every living thing about the ground.  
And after destruct is done, more ships will come
and Egypt shall drop three one ton fire bombs
Which will drill deep down: one-mile into the ground
For each bomb is tying to it's cloak
And the fire shall ignite the gas in the air
setting ablaze the atmosphere

(Chorus)
Hear the science
"Hear the science!"
And the mathematics
"Hear the science!"
of the destruction
"Hear the science!"
in this holy Armagedd-eon

(Chorus)
Hear the science
"Hear the science!"
And the mathematics
"Hear the science!"
of the destruction
"Hear the science!"
in this holy Armagedd-eon

Acid rain coming down from the clouds
"You know Elijah did tell ya!"
Fire burning down the rich man's house
"You know Elijah did warn ya!" 
Hurricane come and blow them house away
"You know Elijah did tell ya!" 
That this is a sign of the Judgement Day
"You know Elijah did warn ya!"

Earth quake shaking up the concrete ground
"Farakkan is here to remind ya!"
Rumors of war spreading all around
"Farakkan is here to remind ya!"
Man have sex with man.  Girl have sex with girl
"Farakkan is here to remind ya!"
That this is a sign of the end of this world
"you know Elijah did tell ya!"

You  better be ready, for the wrath of Allah
Master Farad Muhammad is wrapped in Armagedd-eon
You better be ready now for the fall of Babylon
cause Babylon is going to fall in Armagedd-eon
You better be ready, for the fighting in the street
Cause the war is going to take place in Armagedd-eon
You better be ready now
For when it's time for us to leave
cause if you sleep, you're gonna feel the fire
Cause the fire gonna come in Armagged-eon
The fire gonna come in Armagged-eon
The fire gonna come in Armagged-eon
There's no place to hide.  There's no place to run
Hear the Science
Of the Master J</pre>
