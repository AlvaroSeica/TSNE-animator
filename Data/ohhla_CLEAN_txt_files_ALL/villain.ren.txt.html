[Verse 1: MC Ren] 
Nigga, Villain's back for the old 80s
You other niggaz is bitch fuckin' a snitch
Your whole life is a glitch
Your mamma was a trippin'
Given birth to put a bitch on a certain
You niggaz sound like Clones from the 80s
But what should I expect from the motherfuckin' crack babies?
Fuck the legend, I'm the westcoast Icon
Eat the big fish swimmin' in the small pond
This some Compton classic, nigga blaze
Now choke on the gush for Eazy and the old days
Y'all wanted the Gangster Gangster
Straight up out the hub, fuck the club
And fuck all you niggaz that votted for Bush
Now, your sell out ass is cryin' for Gas
In the Radio still some facts 
With that same bullshit, homie, makin' me laugh
Ugh, who in the fuck tried to sit on my throne?
Fuckin' with my shit while Daddy ain't home
The Villain is back again
Who the fuck you know really fuckin' with Ren?

[Chorus: Ninetrain]
Y'all motherfuckers don't know
I already fucked your whore
And I'm about to smoke up your weed
It's the Return of the Villain, what you motherfuckers need?

[Verse 2: MC Ren] 
Most of y'all niggaz need to quit
With all that money and flossy shit
With all the cars, rims and bitches
And mean brag clothes, y'all some whores
Nigga, y'all shit watered down
Homie, you're a half ounce and Villain the pound
I'm still Always Into Somethin' 
So if It Ain't Rough, ain't fuckin' us
My black ass gotta cuss, I can't change
Just like your bitch suckin' dick at the club in the Range-Rover
It's THE WORLD BIGGEST DICK  ---------&gt; DJ Yella
Tell that whore to move over
She started suckin' dick while I'm puffin' the Dojah
Y'all need this villainous shit
I can't be fucked wit when I start to spit
Now, who in the fuck tried to sit on my throne?
Now, you fake niggaz can bring my shit back home
Who in the fuck tried to sit on my throne?
Fuckin' with my shit while Daddy ain't home
The Villain is back again
Who the fuck you know really fuckin' with Ren?

[Chorus: Ninetrain]
Y'all motherfuckers don't know
I already fucked your whore
And I'm about to smoke up your weed
It's the Return of the Villain, what you motherfuckers need?

[Verse 3: MC Ren]
If you're a Legend, then Villain is an Icon
If you're a boss, then Villain is the Don
You niggaz is nothin' but locals
Go and take ten years, go work on your vocals
West Coast is sittin' on a commission
The same as before only Eazy is missin'
But I'm still that Nigga For Life
Smoke up your weed and fuck your wife
Bitch in the corner straight playin' the role
Don't talk to the Villain if your ass never went gold
From Compton II to UK, real motherfuckers play me everyday
Homie, here's that Return Of The Villain
About to make these whack niggaz go back to drug dealin'
And say to all these studio shit
You sorry motherfuckers, y'all just need to quit
Who in the fuck tried to sit on my throne?
Fuckin' with my shit while Daddy ain't home
The Villain is back again
Who the fuck you know really fuckin' with Ren?

[Chorus: Ninetrain]
Y'all motherfuckers don't know
I already fucked your whore
And I'm about to smoke up your weed
It's the Return of the Villain, what you motherfuckers need?

[MC Ren]
Who in the fuck tried to sit on my throne?
Fuckin' with my shit while Daddy ain't home
The Villain is back again
Who the fuck you know really fuckin' with Ren?

[Chorus: Ninetrain X2]
Y'all motherfuckers don't know
I already fucked your whore
And I'm about to smoke up your weed
It's the Return of the Villain, what you motherfuckers need?
It's the Return of the Villain, what you motherfuckers need?</pre>
