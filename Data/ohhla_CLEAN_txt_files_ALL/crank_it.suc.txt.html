Typed by: Lil Hustle

(*talking*)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, S.U.C.
Put your hands up, put your hands up
Put your hands up, put your hands up

[Chorus - 4x]
We bout to crank it up, y'all ain't crunk enough
Throw yo sets up, crank this bitch up

[H.A.W.K.]
Gangs throw your sets up, gamblers place your bets up
Hoes pull your dress up, hustlers get big bucks
Pimps don't handcuff, cause we drive big trucks
Big rims butter guts, she wanna roll with us
Ladies throw your hands up, ballers throw a grand up
If you feel me stand up, thugs cap the man up
Who got the good stuff, gon' head and fire it up
One puff two puff, let's get fucked up

[Mr. 3-2]
Get wired up fired up, tear the whole house down
Let me know where you at, gon' head scream it now
Give it up where ya at, throw it up in the sky
Represent it if you real, till the day that you die
Screwed Up forever, we ain't going nowhere
Mr. 3-2, bitch I don't fight fair
Oh yeah it's going down, Screwed Up underground
Chop the record two times, bout to slow the world up

[Lil' Keke]
H.A.W.K. told me crank it up, blueberry stank it up
Now we come in two's, my corner's bout to blank it up
Southside young don, money weighing two tons
Killers toting big guns, hater niggaz on the run
Everybody hands up, gangsta niggaz stand up
S.U.C. has crushed every click, that has ran up
Big rims big trucks, y'all niggaz fucked up
7-1-3, every hood get your sets up

[Chorus - 4x]

[Chris Ward]
Get crunk in this bitch, if you drunk in this bitch
Fire y'all skunk in this bitch, or some funk in this bitch
Don't fuck around, and get jumped in this bitch
Oh yeah we deep S.U.C., we leave you stomped in this bitch
It's C. Ward the spokesman, from Yellowstone to Coke-land
When the 4-4's ran, man I don't do no plans
If you got a tainted cup, fuck sipping drank it up
For Screw light your lighters high in the sky, and crank it up

[Clay-Doe]
I got a focused regiment, that focus on presidents
When it's time to represent, you know 'Doches gon' represent
My residence, salute three's to acknowledge me
Fire up that chronic leaf, drank face follow me
Kind of and sorta leave, hoes no apologies
Fuck the authorities, O.G.'s got seniority
And we instruct ya, to get it crunked up
We bout to rumble, see you monsters in this jungle

[Will-Lean]
Will-Lean the Chemist, bout to crank this bitch up
H-A-Dub in the lot, gon' crank the six up
Let's roll Cloverland, nigga throw up your set
And if you still on the block, nigga throw up your tech
Before I show you the 'Vette, I'ma show you the Lac
With Chinese AK's, and folding like stacks
My 18's like guillotines, that will throw out your back
Hit the ship channel nigga, and throw out the gat what

[Chorus - 4x]

Crank this bitch up, crank this bitch up...</pre>
