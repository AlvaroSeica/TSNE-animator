- Hello, is that you, love?
- Sun, I overheard some girls talkin about you today
- And?
- And I don't feel so secure
- Why's that, love?
- Well Sun, I wanna know, do you love me?

Do I love you? You shouldn't have to ask
Love, this is not a front, I'm not wearin a mask
The expression on my face is so loud it can be heard
Like a picture is worth a 1000 words
Picture me with someone else - very hard to do
I wouldn't dare try to picture anybody with you
To walk hand in hand, to say that I am your man
This is jewel number 10, love, do you understand?
To build such love we're born to be right
Don't mistake the way I feel because we argue and fight
we break up to make up, that's all we do
But still after all we've been through
I love you

I do love you, I love you, I love you
Woo-hoo-oo-oo

- Why do you love me?

I love you because you're so soft and sweet
It's a feelin that's heavier than tons of concrete
Just what I've searched for all my life
You're like a mother, a sister, a lover and wife
You bring about a new meaning when I say my girl
Four letters equivalent to this whole world
Everything I've ever wanted in one catergory
With you by my side I write a deep love story
With all the inspiration a woman can give
One kiss to my lips, then I'm hit where I live
And I'm glad to say I can feel this way
Baby forever (Forever?) Forever and a day
Sounds so impossible but I know the deal
Words cannot describe the sensation I feel
For the woman in my life whom I dream of

Look at me, I'm in love

And there's no way I could ever lose you, my desire
The woman I adore, fellas admire me
For havin good taste in body and soul
When you were bein made, baby, they broke the mold
When lyin in bed you occupy my mind
I see a candle-lit dinner, a glass of wine
The light from the candle reflects in your hair
Like the moon onto the water, it's makin me stare
Deep into your eyes, now you realize
I'm the captain of the Love Ship Enterprise
To boldly go where no man has gone
In the words of the late great Marvin -

Let's get it on
Oh baby
Let's get it on
Let's love, baby

- Sun, I wanna let you know somethin
- What's that?
- I only liked Rob as a friend
- Mh-hm
- Maybe he feels a little more for me
  But this is why I pretend
- Go on
- I'm sure I know my feelings and they are for you, as you can see
- So what's the problem?
- I don't wanna make a mistake, Sun
  I wanna make sure that you love me

I used to play and flirt, chasin every skirt
Didn't care who I hurt or made feel like dirt
A girl was a girl, nothin more than a friend
Make love one time and never see her again
Get the telephone number, I promise to call
Break the promise, never even call her at all
That was me back then, but now off hand
I know that love is to understand a woman and man
To be insecure with a desire for more
When you're not even sure it's so immature
Just you and you only, my one of a kind
And lovin you is all that's on my mind

Do-do-do-do-do

- Let's get married then

Not now, I'm too young, ah, I think we should wait
Maybe in two more years we could make it a date
As for now, I don't feel that much ready
See love, I mean, oh, we could just go steady
Why should we rush, I need time to date you
The father taught me we were married by nature
- Can it be you're afraid to ( ? )
I have to go because my mother has to use the phone
Peace
- I love you too, Sun, I love you too</pre>
