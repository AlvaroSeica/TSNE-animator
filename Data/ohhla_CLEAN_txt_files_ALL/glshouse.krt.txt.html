[Chorus 2X: Big K.R.I.T.]
Don't you want to rest that ass in this glass
Don't, don't you want to rest that ass in this glass
Don't, don't you want to rest that ass in this glass house
If you ain't sucking or fucking, get yo' ass out

[Curren$y]
Uh, niggas got shows to get to and shit
Yeah, no time for fucking around
It's the Planes and the Taylor Gang, yeah

Dash digital, situation critical
Hate to make it so blatant baby, but I ain't playing
Maybe you got me confused with one of them other dudes
I ain't none of them, under they breath mumbling
Scared to tell them hoes what it is, you put yourself in that position
I chill with all that baller fishing
You fucked around and you caught a shark
Cold heart, tear your feelings apart
I'm more focussed on getting my rims powder-coated
One of the dopest, I'm Schedule 1, you just ibuprofen
What is you smoking? Them bogus growings, they got you choking
The option's open, you can hide with them suckers
or ride low and get higher than a muh'fucker

[Chorus 2X]

[Wiz Khalifa]
Uh, straight stunting, sucker niggas, I take from 'em
They bitches that is, get up in the car with Wiz
They know they gon' bake something, ain't fronting
Smoke it all, the eighth onion
Get it twisted cause you see me on your computer screen
Thinking cause you got wireless you get as high as us
Bitches leaving they lame niggas to ride with us
Planes over everything, in the fly we trust
Just by the smell it's obvious that my connect come from Cali
I'm good long as the money piling up
All the while I'm just quick lane pimping, big Jane twisting
Walking how I talk it, bitch that's Pittsburgh pimping
Yeah, bitch

[Chorus 2X]

[Big K.R.I.T.]
Yo, now I was candy coated, bending corners, fifth, fifth wheeling
Made a killing with the bumper grill and chandelier ceiling
Plush linen, is you fucking? Is you sucking? I was wondering
cause if not, don't be pushing on my buttons in my cutlass
unless you cutting, bitch I'm just saying, I ain't tricking
is the reason that this porno flick playing, trunk shaking
Knocking pictures off the wall, southern mating call
808 mean no draws, you got friends, I fuck 'em all
What you mean you ain't nasty? Why the fuck you came?
Just imagine what you got to do to get up in my plane
Mississippi pimp, mouth piece frigid
Dolomite out of sight, show you're right, can you dig it shawty?

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
