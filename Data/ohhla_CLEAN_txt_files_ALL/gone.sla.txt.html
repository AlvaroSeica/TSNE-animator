[Intro: DJ Drama]
Truthfully, it's what the game did to us
It's what it made me
Me myself, I just try to get my name on the flyer
That's it, and look back, like damn I did it
It came with a price though
At some point, we all gone

[Chorus: K-Young]
The room is spinnin
My mind is running around in circles
I can't even hear the thoughts I'm thinkin
Cause I'm gone, I'm gone, gone gone
Cause I'm gone, I'm gone, gone gone

[Crooked I]
Talkin to myself I tell me "Crooked is real as this"
Life is a bitch and, death wanna steal a kiss
Slap you when you're born, when you're gone they feel your wrist
to see if your pulse still exists
Livin in the belly, of the beast is a real abyss!
Yeah, walk in a straight line is what you entertain
Then you slang to pay your bills, that's your ying and yang
A daily challenge to find balance within your brain
There's somethin else, livin inside your heart, other than your pain
I look at life as a lesson
For me to change is like a Rolex for a gift, no better time than the present
If not, I'ma be smokin chronic
Drinkin on vodka 'til I choke on my own vomit cause life's a broken promise

[Chorus] w/ ad libs

[Royce Da 5'9"]
When that Slaughterhouse album comin? What's the ETA?
Where that good music at? Where that beat from 'Ye?
Is Crooked and Yaowa only in that group 
to keep from bein in the streets to distribute yay?
Is Royce and Marshall 'bout to link and go their secret way?
Is Joe gon' start a show with all his hoes
like he the prot©g© of Stevie J. for easy pay?
Before y'all become a memory
would y'all please do a song with Kendrick, Young Money, and MMG?
These questions and suggestions they hard to maintain
When you fuck with Flex but you worry what Charlemagne think?
Cause you from the D and don't get no radio play in ya own home
Long as y'all playin Sean I'm good, I'm grown, nigga I'm gone

[Chorus]

[Joell Ortiz]
Have you ever tried to stop cryin but couldn't? Them shots fly in my hood and
Sometimes it'll force a guy to say bye-bye to a good one
Dust some slacks from in the back of that closet and button up
Don't crumble up when you approachin his mother, that hug is tough
It'll make you asthmatic, some can't hack it but look at me
I wear my hat backwards and rap fantastic cause I'm a G
Royce, far as that block I ride past that for them beats
But my niggaz mathematics? Bad traffic, still in the streets
Long as they there, I'm there, survivin for them ones
But they won't stay there, I swear I'ma write 'em out the slums
So when a gun is drawn in the hood man they good
On my tour bus puffin bumpin this song; fuckin fans feelin lucky we gone

[Chorus]

[Joe Budden]
Thought we were defyin the odds, I thought that we weathered the storm
I thought that we'd travel the same road, I thought that we'd never conform
Don't tell me you bastards tricked me, don't tell me that I was just wrong
Cause now I'm masked and it gets to me whenever we're about to perform
Thought we was about to heat up, it's takin a while to get warm
If not for the fact that I love you niggaz and we all get along
I swear I done been got, thought we could all see the writin on the wall
Now I'm disheveled, we was rebels, it ain't as excitin as before
Or maybe the fact that I've been solo so long it's kinda spoiled me
or when I'm annoyed and I try to avoid becomin a victim of loyalty
We were so cuttin edge... (yeah)
My address is this fuckin ledge!
Won't be unhappy, I know how I get one in this state
If I let 'em fuck me this time, it'll be considered rape
We were saviors on our own terms
I've learned if any three of you have wavered let me know
so I can wave good, nah

[Chorus]
