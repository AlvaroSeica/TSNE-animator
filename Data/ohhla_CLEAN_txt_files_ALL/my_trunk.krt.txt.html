[Chorus: Big K.R.I.T.]
My trunk pussy pop (pop), dem hoes down to bop (bop)
My trunk pussy pop (pop), dem hoes down to bop (bop)
M-M-My trunk pussy pop (pop), dem hoes down to bop (bop)
My blades swang and chop (chop), them subwoofers knock (knock)
Show yo' grill hoe (WHAT), show yo' grill hoe (WHAT)
Show yo' grill hoe (WHAT), show yo' grill (show yo' grill)
Show yo' grill hoe (WHAT), show yo' grill hoe (WHAT)
Show yo' grill hoe (WHAT), show yo' grill (show yo' grill)

[Big K.R.I.T.]
+Yeah Dats Me+, yeah dat right
So throwed off the drank that I'm outta sight
Pushin buttons, Caddy corner crushin
Cluckin bussas that claim they wanna fuck tonight
+Ridin' Dirty+, +Super Tight...+
I put the pressure on off-icial when she on the lights
A dark-skinned nigga with a playa voice
I have y'all thinkin I'm Barry White
Pop up twice, I ain't trippin on nuthin
Tires on rotation and the bass still buzzin
Old school whip with the A/C cuttin
Calibrate the navigation, bitch don't touch it
Hit the flo', you bet I get the flo'
I got bands to spend, you got twat to show
You can bop for gold, but I'm grain grippin
Trunk shakin like a stripper pole came with it

[Chorus]

[Big K.R.I.T.]
My car candy-painted (painted), my house sit on a hill (hill)
I never was a square (square), I always worked the wheel (Wheel)
A-A-Always had them boppers (boppers), r-ridin on some choppas (choppas)
Parking lot warfare, my trunk go, "Blocka-blocka!" (Blocka!)
The way I beat the bass, wassup? Might catch a case
Broke another bank and put it in they face
Ever since I rolled up with the doors on Transformer
Fo'd up, po'ed up, niggaz had to hate (had to hate)
Wheels on chrome-up, I had to slow my four's up
Cause them potholes deep and I can't let them scrape (let them scrape)
I let my tape knock, 'til my tape pop
Tell them motherfuckers that I got that bass!

[Chorus]

[Trinidad Jame$]
A-Toooown! I said of course I'ma show my grill 
(YEAAAAH!) and show my ass
I came on this earth in '87 (uh-huh) 
Pussy nigga check my past
Been a real nigga ever since (Yessir!)
ride around the A with my nigga named Tay
Beatin down them fuckin blocks (Bitch!)
from Conley Road to Moreland A
Nigga don't talk, yee ain't 'bout dat life (No sir!)
Drop-top Chevy with the Bow Tie pipes
Let that Chevy breathe on 'em
When ya, pull up, to that, light (OHHH!!!)
Hit that gas and watch that Chevy pop a ollie (Pop a ollie?!)
Half these young niggaz on rims, but my Chevy sit on Rally's
