[MC Chris]
Cruisin Mos Espa, in my De Lorean
War's over I'm a peacetime mandalorian
The story has stumped Star Wars historians
Deep in debate, buffet plate at Bennigan's
Rhyme renegade, sure to penetrate
First and second offense, I won't hesitate
Got a job to do and Darth's the guy that delegates
Got somethin against Skywalker someone he really hates
I don't give a fuck, I'm after Solo
For all I care, he could be hidin at Yoda's dojo
Gotta make the money, credit's no good
When the jawas run the shop in your neighborhood
Think you can cook, I got a grapplin hook
Let's make this quick cause I'm really booked
I'm a devious degenerate defender of the devil
Shut down all the trash compactors on the de-tention level

[Chorus: MC Chris]
My backpack's, got jets; well I'm Boba, the Fett
Well I bounty hunt for Jabba Hutt, to finance my 'Vette (wiki wiki wiki)
Well I chill in, deep space; a mask is over my face
Well I deliver the prize, but I still narrow my eyes
Cause my time I don't like to waste - get down!

[MC Chris]
I'm a question, wrapped inside enigma
Get inside the Slave 1, find your homing signal
From Endor to Hoth, Ripley to Spock
I'll find what you want but there's gonna be a cost
See my name is Boba Fett, I know my shit is tight
Start not actin right, you're frozen in carbonite
Got telescopic sight, flame throwers on my wrist
You still don't get the gist, spiked boots are made to kick
Targets are made to hit - you think I give a shit?!
Yo' momma is a bitch, I see you in the Sarlacc Pit
You just flipped my switch, integrity been dissed
You scratchin on my itch! You know I shoot the gift
I got bambinas at cantinas waitin to lick my lusty lips
So I'll let you get back inside your little space ship
Give you a head start, cause I'm the sportin kind
Consider the startin line the sneaky smile I hide inside
I hope you have hyper drive (drive) pray to stay alive ('live)
Don't try to slip me a five cause I never take a bribe
To the beat of a different drummer, bad-ass bounty hunter
Let no man put asunder or else they be put under
As in - six feet, got an imperial fleet
backin me up, gonna blow up any attempt to defeat
They got a, Death Star, I got four payments on my car
I hand it over to Hammerhead at Mos Eisley bar
He used to carjack, now he's a, barback
Just goes to show how you can get back on the right track
As for me that's not an option, can't say that with more clarity
Me goin legit would be like Jar Jar on speech therapy

[Chorus]

[MC Chris]
Slice you open like a tauntaun, faster than the Autobahn
or a motorbike in Tron, do the deed and then I'm gone
Jabba has a hissyfit, contact Calrissian
Over a Colt, the plan unfolds, no politic is legit
Back in the day when I was a slave
Living life in the fast lane, like in a pod race
Mean streak tweaked I became a basket case
So this space ace split that place, post haste
Took up a noble cause, called the Clone Wars
Life's not all about girls and cars
Gettin fucked up in fucked up bars
See, I'm not a retard, or gay like DeBarge
I'm large and in charge with a face so scarred
A cold black heart that's been torn apart
The Sith wish that they had a dick so hard
Cause it's long long ago in a pussy far far
Call me master, cause I'm faster than Pryor on fire
I no longer have to hot wire
I'm a hunter for hire, with no plans to retire
And all the sucker MC's CAN CALL ME SIRE!!!

[Outro]
My backpack's, got jets...
Well I'm Boba, the Fett...
Well I bounty hunt for Jabba Hutt...
To finance my 'Vette...</pre>
