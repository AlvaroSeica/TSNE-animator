Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Sittin on back, got a big sack of weed
Got a bottle of beer and a joint, it's all I need, and that's cool
Do you know why I'm smiling?
Smiling because of the way that I feel
I said, ain't gone be no denying the way that I feel and I know this feeling
is from drinking all my beers and I'm up on the phone (up till 4) (end up on the floor)
I said it doesn't really matter cause just wanna get in on (I'm not gonna get old)
I've got to move

Sun goin down, ain't nobody around
Fuckin feeling the breeze, ask her to get on her knees she say "cool"
Do you know why we smiling? Smiling because of the way we feel
I say, no, be no denying, the way that I feel and I know this feeling
And think that I'm crazy for the things I get into
When everybody in the club gonna act like a damn fool
Just move</pre>
