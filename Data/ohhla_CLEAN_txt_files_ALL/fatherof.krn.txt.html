(*talking*)
Father father, I'm so happy that you could come
(why wouldn't I come, I told you I'd be here)
I'm glad you made it on time, (where is he)
He's this way follow me, (how long has he been in this state)
It's been about three days, (I'm going to need everyone
To leave this room, I will contact you when I'm finished)
 
[K-Rino]
I'm the helter skelter, bomb shelter melter
Stealth atomic alkaseltser, top and bottom jaw welder
Dissecular thought exiter, whips from my techs are so extra wrecker
It stretches from you, to the devil that's standing next to ya
They gathering the battlers, gastly unaware
Of the fabulous passages, in my vast cavern of Salamis
I'm not a catalyst of Avaris
I send raps in the mail, that are more hazardous than anthrax packages
The rap arachnid, track critic
Who Ju-Jitsu kicked the blue sky, and left a massive crack in it
I'm par excellence, user of septuons
A genius spawn, of uninterperable lexacons
My anger hits high peaks, that leaves the eyes reddish
Explosive technician, with a homicide fettish
Compose a symphony, the first day life into me
No doctor was needed, I performed a self delivery
My raps should be, the castle inhabited lavishly
With every manufactured character, mapped in a tapestry
The sheet was seemingly blank, so the pitiful think
It was literal, but I write words in invisible ink
How much pillaging can a page do
Well if it's mine it'll incage you, and electrically taze you back to age two
I salavate above a cauldren
That's so hot, it takes a century just to cool down to starting
In the ring, ain't no burning me out
You'll never get a standing aid, you'll get a laying down eternity count
I see through blizzards clear, everyone's in fear when the wizard's here
They placed a sheet over me, but when they raised me I had disappeared
I deceptively, envelope you
My depth is too heated, for you to swallow like a new born sipping Theraflu
I got several, methods to stretch you in my weapon pool
So move, unless you got a extra neck to lose
K is never in a glamour mood
I'm a tyrannical fool, who caniballizes canibals on channel 2
The ill mannered, Bruce Banner dude
Who built the mechanical warcraft, without even reading the manual
I'm sarcastic and synical
I got blinded amnesia, but I still didn't forget to not remember you
Unparables are unbareable, I stare at you
The shoot a verbal arrow through, let it slice and make a pair of you
Storms come after the thunder starts
One spark'll become a thought, I never left my feet and did a somersault
I throw a spear through the clear blue, and pierce you
Until you scream so loud, Venus people'll hear you
Once a year I appear new, got a mistical vehicle
That lets me see a thousand miles back, in the rearview
I operate, under several names
Like murders I can have arranged, I stomp and trample brains into gravel grains
Imitators become so enthrawled
But once my vocals go in y'all, they toxifying cake up on your coated walls
I'm so skillfully gifted
That I spit six verses on seven beats, and every one of em were different
The next move I made, was colder
Seven flows on six beats, one each and had nothing left over
I'm here, but I appear in disguise
I've taken furier guys, and make your eyes dematerialize
I did a historical check, and explored my depths
And discovered I went to war, with them before my conseption
I be exploring facts, and recording tracks
That go deeper than sores in backs, and wahcks from Lizzy Borden's axe
Experimenting, new delayed effect raps
You walk away today, but much later your neck snaps
We are not, on a even accord
Six months old, I was recieveing a lifetime achievement award
Lyrically I am the omney, it's not beyond me
To gain energy, from swallowing red bull tsunamis
I'm never in a cautious state
I go fishing for prehistoric prey, in morbid dark waters and use sharks for bait
Your epidermis'll rot
During a scurmage I learned to tie his nick, into a tourniquet knot
Man I promise, you don't know the half
Every picture of my family from the last hundred years, I was in the photograph
I enjoyed, all the drama that my rap employed
They paranoid from dillusions, of circular trapazoids
I bomb your vehicle, unrighteously
Your windhsield wipers were a sight to see, trying to wipe me a right to breed
A sci-fi movie enthusiast
A student of unrulyness, broke loose from Mt. Vesouvius's nucleus
Antibiotic lyricist, any mental impurities I'm curing it
Illustrator of thought, the cloud purifist
My pen, is like a quick clean scalpel
I sleep strapped to dream clap you, rap example of the sixteen chapel
I'm schizophrenic, leprechaun crazy
I mate with robot ladies, and create decepticon babies
My narratives, average men babbling
For faster land travel, I'll grow some back legs and start galloping
I hear hoola, abra-cadabra men
And wrote a whole album in five minutes, with my miraculous magic pen</pre>
