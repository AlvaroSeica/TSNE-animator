{*ad libs and shouts for the first 24 seconds*}

[Verse One]
This is horse shit, please abort this
I'm not a fiend muh'fucker I don't snort shit
But see you forced it, down my throat
like I wanna be forcefed, I talk divorce here
I don't wanna be married to the game
if that bitch so thick, I'd be yellin for a moment
Controlled breech, don't let the soul speak
So when the real come out it's like a slow leak
In time I'm holdin up the real, intoxicating feel
I give it to you raw like a butcher shop
Poppin off the seal; ensure the freshness ain't expired
like these high rappers on the radio that you hear
I'm a shield - against the whackness attackin yo' ears
Be glad I'm here
Cause I give you somethin worth listenin to
You heard what I'm givin you?

[Chorus]
I'm spittin nuttin but the realness over here
No drama bits - no counterfeit
Come and listen to the music, you armed
to recapture what the mood is - on
I'm spittin nuttin but the realness over here
You know I'ma get what's not counterfeit
And I promise no bullshit
Yeah, as I'm talkin from the pulpit, no counterfeit

[Verse Two]
Higher than ever, and I'm feelin fly as a feather
Make a beat, write a rhyme, then I tie 'em together
to make knots of cash
And my kicks 'bout as crisp as a Stockton pass
Hearin lots of trash up on the radio
I'm the illest you never heard, that's not debateable
You lookin for your inspiration, well say hello!
I'm cold, I can turn a sauna into 8 below
I'm tryin to tell you this is next level~!
These girls love me - in the bed she get a sex medal
Soon as I leave Keisha then I probably text Carol
See they styles counterfeit, they not cut the same
On my X-Box Kinect, they can't touch my game
Goin harder than a steel pipe
It's like some stuffed up J's the way I kill mics/Mike's
Man I swear everything I write is real life
My art's never gonna stop when it feels right

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
We sucker free!
Yo you just a imitation, a replication
and drippin with precipitation of fraudulence
It's all in yo' bars and the flow in the songs that you throw on
And you want people to honor this?!
I laugh at your goofy ass, cause you bastards don't seem to get it
See you gots to be gone with this here
Cause if you ain't strong with this here
You disrespectin those that belong in this here
So be gone - am I clear?!
Every year a new clown nigga wanna be seen
And a lot of real niggaz ain't meant to emcee
Rap is so out of control, rap is so O.C.
And that's exactly why nowadays I'm so low key
Cause I ain't gotta be caught up in the nonsense
I'd rather make music now to calm my conscience
I'm at peace with the game (I'm at peace baby)
So I ain't gotta mingle and associate with all these counterfeit lames

[Chorus]</pre>
