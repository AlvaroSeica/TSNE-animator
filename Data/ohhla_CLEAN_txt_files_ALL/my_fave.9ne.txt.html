Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Versus 1: Tech N9ne]
Steady shooting for the stars
On this vertical journey I be recruiting more for bars
Gotta be hard, in the car
I'm running with cannons that really loosen your regards

Greedy money, and then some
These motherfuckers will murder you for your income
So when the flash the pass to begin some
Spitting my favorite of Prozak and Lynch Hung

After the shows I'm thinking about food
Just give me some [?] and drinks I'm cool
You probably thinking that a womans my juice
But I drool over Italian cooking is my joo

I eat all of it all the time
At the mall even y'all
When they called the n9ne
Money tall yes I ball missing all the sign
[?] we could meet but never draw the line

Doctor said that my blood pressure pew
I was healthy for one minute but then fumes
Of a pepper corn fillet within the room
I gotta go get it soon, you seeing the nigger zoom

Capital grill and a melting pot
They know my name PF Chang so they help a lot
You let the n9ne cut the line when its sweltering hot
to wine and dine me and we belting lot

I can't stop eating, I really love eating
I know my body be wishing I was vegan
The fat of my stomach it was leaving me, feeding me
All I be thinking when I be breathing un evely

It don't matter, I'm taking it to the head
Tucking my tummy they using bigger thread
Telling me if I don't be careful and kill the bread
I'm gonna pig out until a nigga dead

[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]
Insatiable's my name
When it comes to my favorite things
[?] nights I come to pray
Of my favorite
I never plan to die, too much haven't tried
Give me more, give me more
I crave it, yes I love it, that's my favorite

[Versus 2: Prozak]
I'm an addict, [?] I never pay
Kamikaze coming closer to my blood stream
Caffeine, nicotine, medical green
[?]
prepare for lift off, stimulation drift off
If I don't feed my addiction I get pissed off
All these voices [?]
I got the devil in my right hand

Always leaving me decitful theivery
procedes to impede so theres not much steem in me
in need to feed to be stuffed in eagerly
I can't seem to leave it be and be free

Feel my synapses, collapsing I'm gasping
I think I'm going down like Michael Jackson

Tunnel vision everything is going black
And I'm headed to a place where there never is no coming back

Swan dive in a lake of fire
All thanks to my faithful drug suppliers
Now the taste is a taste like you all subscribers
under the reigns of the chains of your own desires
Your new god is in black atire
Never slave to his rays you can not defy him
Such a waste to the race til your life expires
no escape, given chase like Michael Meyers

[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]
Insatiable's my name
When it comes to my favorite things
[?] nights I come to pray
Of my favorite
I never plan to die, too much haven't tried
Give me more, give me more
I crave it, yes I love it, that's my favorite

[Versus 3: Brotha Lynch Hung]
After the shows I be off to eat
Got a big fat sack and it be all for me
6 in the morning I be off these
Yelling 6 in the morning like my nigger has tea

I pop all of it all the time
And they put me in the zone when I'm writing rhymes

Drugged out, about to take the mug out
Taking gallons of water I gotta get the drug out

So stuck like I'm sniffing coke up
And I love it just as much as I love eating cold cuts
Yeah I'm the nigger that eat ya whole lunch
be tryin to rape me but I be like hold up

Date rape about to set a rape tape
Yeah Kim Kardashian Ray J
All up in that ass again Mayday
I'm just sick in the head as they say

I be off the top Tech N9ne [?]
Then I'm paranoid ready to pull it its off top
Y'all better than us hard slagger
Bitches on the Tech N9ne stage its goin pop

Grrrr
And it's all up to her
She just popped the pill and I'm [?]

This is not for real
When I'm ill
Call me a Beastie Boy and I will

[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]
Insatiable's my name
When it comes to my favorite things
[?] nights I come to pray
Of my favorite
I never plan to die, too much haven't tried
Give me more, give me more
I crave it, yes I love it, that's my favorite</pre>
