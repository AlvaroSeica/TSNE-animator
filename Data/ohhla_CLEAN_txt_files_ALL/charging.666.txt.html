(Chorus)
What them niggaz doin, chargin these hoes
What them niggaz doin, chargin these hoes
What them niggaz doin, chargin these hoes
Hoes, hoes, they ain't nothin but hoes
(2X)

[DJ Paul]
What the true players doin, ooh
They makin these hoes pay the motherfuckin cost, to the real motherfuckin boss
Pimpin is how I make my living, you fools need to keep paying bitch
That's why you gettin poor, I'm sturdy gettin rich
Why they payin these hoes I can't fear it after the bitch be chewin
Is throwin her whole fuckin back out and not get a dime after
What, ho I don't need ya, what I'm gonna eat ya, bitch I'm bouta beat ya
And what's up with them hoes who made the song Chewin Ass Nigga
Tramp ass bitch have you forgot that I had the picture
from the cam-corder in the closet, caught you hoes slippin
These bitches be gettin mad when they here
their name on the tape, they start to trippin
That's how it is fuckin with a Backyard nigga
My nigga Lord Infamous got fingers on the trigger
Aiming for your face, letting you hoes know the score
yo Juicy what the niggaz doin

[Juciy J] They chargin these hoes mane

[Chorus]

[Juicy J]
I met a little freak bitch, who always wore tight shit
Had five kids and her pussy had a tight grip
The first of the month came, the first of the month came
I saw the mail man coming now it's time to run game
Give me half the check bitch, niggaz like me never quit
Big nose red bitch, let your lips meet my dick
Pay up the money for the running of my cum on your tongue
Juicy Low Down J will never get sprung
Never was your friend see, all a nigga want is cheese
McDonald's, Crystal's, Burger King, Wendy's
Whatever kind of check it is, charging hoes is my biz
D-Magic, Project Pat, I know my nigga down for his
Yeah you hoes know the score, wanna fuck, gimme the dough
Credit cards, crazy checks, all that type of shit will go
To you little dirty freaks, keep my name out your mouth
Unless you want a job bitch, that's what I'm talkin about

[Chorus]</pre>
