(Samples)
"You think you know who you fuckin' wit now
Killa-killa Bill...ain't nobody stoppin' this now"
"Now who want WHAT!! We got..."
"Real deal hip-hop, even when my shit shot"
"You think you know who you fuckin' wit now
Killa-killa Bill...ain't nobody stoppin' this now"
"When you listen to my shit you don't chew, you don't breathe,
You don't miss a fuckin' line"

[Reef the Lost Cauze]
Anotha fuckin' classic

I'ma animal, yeah a lot like a monkey
And my pride is too sick, dawg you not gon' junk me
And my squad is too thick, you not gon' jump me
I'll knock you ova fuckin' wall like "humpty dumpty"
I'm the king of the castle, king of the battle
I'll dumb out like king when you gamble
And I'm classic like LL's kangol
Overseas runnin' the streets with Hell's Angels
You at home, playin' wit Wii
Nintendo, negro stop playin' wit me
I am the best, c'mon say it wit me
Fuck rappers, Reef is my favorite emcee, WORD!
I'ma own ya time, you'll get stolen, stomped
You'se mama's bul, your bitch still folds ya socks
You don't want beef and I'm so shocked
My niggas can't hold jobs they just know to hold glocks
It's not my fault I spaz alot
What you expect, I came under Paz &amp; Mach
Came from behind, Taji, Tareek and Koran
City of Philly, I am the evil of spine
Yeah, I'm Bad Newz
Especially when you see me wit the white bul wit tatoo will fuckin' smash you
It's Lost Cauze illegal wit the Snowgoons
You ain't know I'll be back bangin' two soul swords

(Chorus) Reef 2x
Ayo 'This is Where the Fun Stops'
This is purple haze, rum drop
This is knife wounds and gun shots
This shit here is vulgar and trife
The words I write, the illest shit you heard in ya life

[Reef the Lost Cauze]
Well maybe not, but I'm crazy hot
And the world is mine, but the baby's not
Always lightin' up drugs wyldin' in the club
I'm not grown and sexy, I'm childish and smuggs
Stay in ya lane stupid or drink rain fluid
Niggas in Philly tryin' to be the next Frank Lucas
We don't talk out, I promise we bangin' thru it
And Crip is my Blood, but we ain't no gang influenced
I'm in the Dodge wit plan, tryin' to dodge the man
Tryin' to get rich what part of the plan
Don't you comprehend, Einstein!!!
Don't need to repeat, just say my name one time
And I will be there to spit your frame
I rock, use to lag mics, crystal cave
I'll break ya arms, then start orderin' shots like...
J채gerbombs! J채gerbombs! J채gerbombs! J채gerbombs! 

(Chorus) Reef 2x

(Outro) Reef
Yeah, Snowgoons, Reef the Lost Cauze
We like 3-3 right now, battin' bout a 100
You mothafuckaz suck
That's why you can't come ova here and record shit
Nobody wants you; you don't need to get a fuckin' passport
There's no reason, ME?
I'm world wide bitch, I'm all ova this mothafucka
I might pop up in mothafuckin' Sweden one day and mothafuckin' UK the next
Germany, Switzerland, and then be back in Philly on the block like I ain't got shit
Cuz you niggas will not rob me
Call me what you will, just don't call me
And don't call Stress neither
Yeah, all of a sudden right you got love for us now right?
Take a number, just not mine
Lost Cauze, I'll see y'all in 08
I'm learning German out this mothafucka
Know'I'm'sayin'? I'm bilingual...one!</pre>
