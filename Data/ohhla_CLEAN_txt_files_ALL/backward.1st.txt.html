[Intro: Havoc]
Right there, yeah.. spin that back
Yeah.. uhhh.. straight out the lab
Chemistry made.. you know, yo

[Verse One: Havoc]
I don't wanna web
I just wanna chill but gettin still gettin confronted by ice grills
They learn when I hit 'em with, heat and conspicious
Stunt, just a little bit - start, we gonna finish this shit
You little niggaz runnin round snot nose
I laugh with a cold grin I dead you wanna pose
You fuckin with a nigga who done been through the bullshit
Niggaz die masabi, close friends turn to grimy
Wifey, bonin associates, hate a simple bitch
Add it all together: you know who you fucking wit
A nigga who can give a fuck when he broke
Give a fuck what he tote, got the drop then blow
You's a scared nigga tryna live
Yellow back 'n shit
You's a real good actor, your click actresses
Fact is, niggaz lose stripes for tryna match this
Havoc's a total package, knock a nigga of his axis

[Hook: Havoc] [2x]
Twist ya cap backwards, real niggaz handle
Beef, then it's on dunn, lick off if I have to
Niggaz scream gangsta, real niggaz play low
Play in the back, but fuck around and get smacked yo

[Verse 2: Prodigy]
Yo dunn I love it when these niggaz think it's somethin sweet wit P
Love it when people doubt me
Love it when you niggaz write songs about me, I love confrontation
Love it when a nigga that don't rap, he hatin
I love it when they think it's only a song I'm fakin
I love to see they face when my gun bangin
And I would love for us to bump it to each other on a humble
Your niggaz is stabbin, my niggaz'll buck you
Y'all niggaz is flaggin, yeah we got one too
Infamous, I heard you screamin our name, whatup with you?
Let me explain something, we the world's most
Y'all rap niggaz, we do this shit for real though listen
I knock ya hustle down kid
You's a fall to the next nigga, I murder you bitch
I would love to watch you bleed and take ya last breath
Give you pain, and let you get acquainted with death
Boy I.

[Hook: Havoc] [2x]
Twist ya cap backwards, real niggaz handle
Beef when it's on dunn, lick off if I have to
Niggaz scream gangsta, real niggaz play low
Play in the back, but fuck around and get smacked yo</pre>
