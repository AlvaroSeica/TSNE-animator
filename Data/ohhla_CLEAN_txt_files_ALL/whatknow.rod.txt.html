Album:  Rodentity
Song:   What U Know About
Typed by: Cno Evil

[Intro: Tai Fiyah]
What you know, what you know about...
What you know, what you know about...

[Chorus 2X: Tai Fiyah]
What you know about Mouse? What you know about Cno?
What you know about The Rodentz? What you know about the sequel?
Listen, this is Rodentity, pay attention, G
With the lethal darts, raps is a weaponry

[Cno Evil]
What you know about hip hop that's not down south
Real East New York talk, spitting out of my mouth
Now back to N.Y., pass the baton to Mouse
These kids don't play, verbal parties up in the house
DJ scratch that, Rode rap, show them where it's at
Lethal darts, raps like weapons, you heard that?
Cno E., Rodentity with Li
Show you where we be, up in W.P.
White Plains rearrange all the cells in you brain
Men with methods, from all the pain that we brang
All the bells that we rang, from the belles that sang
For the hell we brought, for all the well we fought for
Cno E., well, yes, shut you like a locked door
911 emergency, what you called for, sir?
Hip hop is dead, like Nas said, we came to resurrect
Breathe some life into your head for another second
Listen and observe and you might just learn a lesson
Rodentz is the hip hop lethal weapons
Like Murtaugh and Riggs or maybe Tubbs and Crockett
The black and white combos why the plug is in the socket
New York Vice, two MC's is above nice
C and Li roll with many 'monks and many mice
While rappers roll around with many chunks of ice
Pizza slice, you skunks, you better think twice
Before fucking with the Order Rodentia kingdom
You get three lumps on your head and then some
And I'm not talking about sugar, ain't nothing sweet
(Sample: One lump, or two? No lumps..)
You must be living one of those things called a dream
Only two MC's but still considered a team
When you think the song is over, you get more
Your shit is a bore, that's why we snore

[Chorus 2X]

[Li-Mouse]
Cno Evil, Li-Mouse, now we all grown
Who you know who can sample phone dial tones?
Make a hot beat that sounds official
More deadly then children playing with pistols
When we come through, your resistance is hopeless
Streaming attacks is too much for you to cope with
I wrote this, while I was focused
Scatter like roaches, and swarm minds like farms and locus
Hocus pocus, poof, gone, approach us
We only let smart MC's ever coach us
That means you bitch MC's back the fuck up
Switch fast, or get, wrapped the fuck up
Like some shit on the 25th of December
Whatever gender, surrender to my splendor
Bent out of shape like a fender bender
Illustrate these lines perfect when I render
No other words, man, your shit is just wack
And this ain't the kettle, calling the pot black
No this is real, Rodent type rap
So get back, like the cereal bitch, you get smacked
I cut through flesh like chainsaws and trees
You look nice when you fall off like autumn leaves
My style is ridiculous, you stay deciduous
I'm on the mic, and I remain vigorous
This is easy like Staples commercials
Live on Saturday night, no rehearsal
What you know about me, kid, fuck that
What you know about C, kid, you better shut that
Like ice cream freezers in mid-summer
If not, prepare for a permanent slumber
Permanent slumber, kid...

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
