*Tempo has reached critical level*

[Verse 1]
(Yeh)
Why you spitting them shoddy ass bars
You couldn't make that dodgy past last?
Your wrap sheet makes even bobbies ass laugh
I seen your boys riding noddy cars past
Tokes is real, I got the polygraph passed
never gonna chill, let the bodyparts graft
don't trust your boys
they probably bastards
fucking ducking down while ya bodyguard blast
They never thought I'd be as dope as that
thought I'd end up with a broken back
running around asking where the smokers at
and ho's are at
but now I got my focus back
Why you chilling with pussy-wipped brears
all the time asking, who she with, where?
Feeling like they wanna walk the plank
they better talk to Frank
My hash dealer called me up
said he bought the plank
your crack dealer called you up
he thought you sank.
bruv, what I record is rank
I ain't the type a brother could afford to shank

[Chorus]
What you gonna do? When the crowd start panikin
How you gonna act? When the crowd start panikin
Are you gonna act - Like a mutherfucking manikin
When the gun shots and the crowd start panikin
What you gonna do? When the crowd start panikin
How you gonna act? When the crowd start panikin
Are you gonna act - Like a mutherfucking manikin
When the gun shots and the crowd start
Are you gonna
Run - like it's an emergency
Flee - like it's an emergency
Duck - like it's an emergency
What you gonna do? What's it gonna be?
Are you gonna
Run - like it's an emergency
Flee - like it's an emergency
Duck - like it's an emergency
What you gonna do? What's it gonna be? (Huh)

[Verse 2]
I'll leave your bitch with a leaking muff
even if you try cheat and bluff
I don't know why your fucking speaking tough
when I know that tonight you'll be sleeping rough
or sneaking puff
that's bashed down so you sneeze and huff
wheeze, wipe it on your sleeve and cuff
that cheapest stuff ain't at least enough
My gunks strong like a horses leg
ho's want some, they forced to beg
bruv, I know that of course its dread
but if they ain't got the bread
then of course its head
Find a mutherfucking horses head
laying dead in your daughters bed
blud I know that of course it's dread
but I caused the red
sprayed on the walls and bed

[Chorus]
What you gonna do? When the crowd start panikin
How you gonna act? When the crowd start panikin
Are you gonna act - Like a mutherfucking manikin
When the gun shots and the crowd start panikin
What you gonna do? When the crowd start panikin
How you gonna act? When the crowd start panikin
Are you gonna act - Like a mutherfucking manikin
When the gun shots and the crowd start
Are you gonna
Run like it's an emergency
Flee like it's an emergency
Duck like it's an emergency
What you gonna do? What's it gonna be?
Are you gonna
Run like it's an emergency
Flee like it's an emergency
Duck like it's an emergency
What you gonna do? What's it gonna be? Huh</pre>
