[Demi Lovato]
I love the way you're talking
I'm lovin what you're doing, boy
I don't fall easy often
I've never had a love like you before
 
I like you, put your number, put your number
in my phone phone phone phone phone phone phone, yeah
You heard me right so call me, call me
when you're all alone 'lone 'lone 'lone 'lone 'lone 'lone
 
[Chorus: Demi Lovato]
Don't make plaaaaaaans
C'mon with me, we'll stay up all night long
I want you, and I want you baaaaaaaaad
Let's keep the party goin all night long
Let's keep the party goin all night long (Hey!)
All night long (Hey!), all night long (Hey!), all night, all night
All night long (Hey!), all night long (Hey!), all night, all night
Ah-ah-ah-all night!
 
[Demi Lovato]
I'm on another planet
I'm in another universe
You may not understand it
Sooner or later baby you will learn
 
I like you, put your number, put your number
in my phone phone phone phone phone phone phone, yeah
You heard me right so call me, call me
when you're all alone 'lone 'lone 'lone 'lone 'lone 'lone
 
[Chorus]

 
[Missy Elliott]
We could party all night night, wanna spend a night night?
Will you be my type? By the end of the night we could pillow fight
Yo' Missy's real nice, come closer cause I don't bite
You talkin how I like, you play daddy, I play wife
I-I-I'm so alone, no-no-no one is home
I got yo', got yo' na-na-number in my telephone
Wanna wanna wanna be ya gurl, wanna wanna wanna be my man
Boy we can hold hands, write our names in the sands
It's the weekend, don't make plans
 
[Timbaland] (Demi Lovato)
Party start - (when you're here)
After dark - (we don't care)
{*both*} We gon' set it off, we-we gon' set it off
Party start - (when you're here)
After dark - (we don't care)
{*both*} We gon' set it off, we-we gon' set it ah-ah-off
 
[Chorus]</pre>
