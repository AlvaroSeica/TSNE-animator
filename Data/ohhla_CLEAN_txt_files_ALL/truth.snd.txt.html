Man, her body was smooth
Moves fluid as Steen's syrup
Thicker than Serena, skirt-up
Straight up, and this story ain't made up
I end up behind her like 'wait up'
And had to think quickly
She turned around and frowned
Then it hit me
'I love real easy, but I love real hard
If you dis my respect I'ma dis your regard
You can't dis my courageÂ’
A brother just tryin' to be nourished
To my surprise conversation flourished
She told me of things that I never knew
And by my mind the info instantly flew
So, of course, interest grew
Now I'm figurin' out what we meant to do
You don't have to be intuitive to know I'm into you
Maybe I was sent to you
Hope I'm not kin to you
Beauty ain't stunnin' 'cause of no sips of brew
We should sit down for a dinner interview
Later on talkin' 'bout grown-up stuff
You sinner you

[chorus]
You don't have to believe it if it ain't truth
(repeat)

[Poetree]
Finally...
Your lips speak
But not without your head
I suspected all you wanted
Was a poem in your bed
And yes I am a poem
Rhythmic, sultry, and new
Verses so serene 
Ever ready to subdue
But you...
You have no intentions
Things that you mention
Ease all my tension
This boy's on a mission
So let's take the true ascension
On the way, I'll believe 
What you sayin' is real
Touched and relieved 
By the truths you reveal
But if you kick that BS 
And try to come all hard 
Well, then I gotta break out 
Leave your tired love scarred 
Now you don't have to say..... 
That stuff's already been said 
Forget the sex and make love 
To what's inside of my head 
I can be your bed of roses 
If your heart is not dead 
Give me the trueness 
Of Bavuness 
And my soul will be fed 
Know thyself as King 
And I'm sure to crown you 
But you don't have to believe it 
If it ain't all truth.

[chorus]

[Bavu]
We don't have to lay down to be down
Or stay down to rebound, let's learn

[Poetree]
Be clever, caring, witty, ready
Take a passionate hold
Be forever, live together
Have the kids and grow old
 
[Bavu]
Lay the foundation like only fathers can
Women are sandpaper for what bothers man
Stuff he can't stand

[Poetree]
All we need's this beat to move us
As our souls become one
Let this rhythm mix and move us
Build a union move on

[Bavu]
From pursuing our bond
To the point we're responsible and equally fond
I'm seeing way beyond
Us just meeting for small talk, greetings and such
Let's just keep in touch, true enough?</pre>
