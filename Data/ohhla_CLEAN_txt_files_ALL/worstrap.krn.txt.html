(*talking*)
Yeah, y'all wanna know who I am
I'm bout to tell y'all who I am

[Hook]
I'm the, worst rapper alive yo
When they see me hit the corner, they be running like I'm 5-0
No chance, for survival
Any man come test, left dead on arrival

[K-Rino]
I murder fools in exhausted ways, it starts with a arson blaze
No caution I shorten days, stand over graves and rip till I make coffins raise
A dark haze covers my noggin, cause chaos imprays
Spark and raise a light, that reach the red planet where the martians stay
Then I cast a verbal spell, flowing
Y'all ain't knowing on the microphone, I go deep like Terrell Owens
Vestibilize ya, from the chin up
I torture you rappers, I shave the hair off of your head and braid your skin up
I'm part sionide, I'm part venom
I got jars in my kitchen cabinet that look empty, but it's really thoughts in em
Witness my plan, you'll understand I'm a sinister man
Jumped off a two foot brick, and it took me ten minutes to land
The beats I own, hit and pound domes
My mind's expansive, I got workers on my brain now building town homes
I leave your defense delinquent, and ultrasound showed how I seen frequent
The unborn embryos, dream sequence

[Hook]

[K-Rino]
I'm the words in the sky, like cannibus smoke
A unanimous vote I could slander his quote, slice his neck and hand him his throat
I roll with facts, give me a pen and that's all she wrote
Control the axis of million men, with a small remote
I spit the best, pass my book and I'm a instant threat
I speak to life forms, that ain't even in existence yet
The phrase-ologist, bring bastards to me
One verse takes you from illiteracy, to a master's degree
They be fearing this, rain hemeriged way before they be hearing this
I take pride in give me this, spirit of out of body experience
Dilliberately deliver a DNA, to a cynical feminist
Stood mirror-less gazed at brick walls, and seen physical images
My flow is a mixture of a seven figure body, counting a bible scripture
Future predictor, with wicked riches in my baby pictures
When I first out, pull your hearse out
If you bite I'll punch a hole in your stomach, reach in and pull my verse out

[Hook]

[K-Rino]
I'm off of you with the hand and I, quickness of a stenographer
Worked part time at a cosmos, to the fly ghost photographer
Go to war with ya, a thousand horses couldn't drag me off of ya
Too raw for ya, that's why you on my wood just like carpenter
My metomorphesis took place, and the death toll started soaring to
New heights I was awarded for, steady outscoring the coroner
According to the majority, I'm the order that gives more to ya
Remarkable flame talker, please stop me if I'm boring ya
I spit my flow with precision, if I get you in the chin I'm flooring ya
Hit quick whenever tricks get ignant, like liquid I'm pouring ya
I bu-buck, now you don't want that it ain't no tomorrow for
To knock me out the pocket, it's gon take a hundred more of ya yeah

[Hook - 2x]</pre>
