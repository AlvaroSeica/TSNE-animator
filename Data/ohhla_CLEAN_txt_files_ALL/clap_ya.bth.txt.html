[Chorus]
Clap ya hands now people clap now
Clap ya hands now people clap ya hands

[T.J.]
Now what you know bout the kid on the strip
Mack extend a clip
I seen pappy get a brick
or crack from fity fifth
I'm not a game, I'm a gangsta
Slap you with the fifth
Lay low, eh yo! Back up in the mix
I'm a two time felon, two time rebellin
Do crime, do time, no sides are tellin
Rather blow with the case
Never roll with the state
Name hold heavy weight
I sold crack in every state
that I been through
I got plenty shots to send you
Your man too, better back up like an (?)
Whoa, you dudes don't really want it
I cock that glock back, bullets all in your stomach
I'm gangsta, thats with a capital G
Y'all niggas pranksters, don't wanna battle with me
Cause I take it the streets while y'all fakin on beats
The type that wanna speak when y'all faced with the heat
Dat ain't gangsta

[Bathgate]
Naw that ain't gangsta at all
Y'all niggas is soft
I kill style I'm rippen em off
Keep them dudes like hand nails, clippin em off
Man I'm attached to my money like I'm cotten em off (
