[Intro: Chris Webby]
To all the families affected by the tragic events that took place in Newton, Connecticutâ¦
Our hearts are with you
We're here for you

[Chorus]
Spread your tiny wings to the skies that we are from
Let our hope just reign, let us know we're not alone
Spread your tiny wings over all you love and know
All my queens and kings, don't worry you're going home

[Verse 1: OnCue]
This we're living really, it ain't appealing, it's hard
How you dealing, how you feeling, we all children at heart
Stop this killing, we ain't animals is what sets us apart
I was sent here to do this so let me play my part
I wake up that Friday like, "Damn man you must be kidding"
We need some change but I ain't saying I'm a politician
The only policy that's seen the way is the buddy system
I ain't preaching, I'm just wishing that somebody listen
I hold my brother, called his daughter, told her that he loved her
I called my mother even though I usually try to duck her
I could be so selfish out here trying to cake up
And I'm ashamed it takes this for us to wake up
Let our angels fly away, but not in vain
We could change, right now I'm just saying, trying to share my pain
I know nothing seems to make sense, how could we just go on
But it's in our hands, it's up to us to hold on
I wish I knew him, I wish I knew her
Shouts to the teachers, shape the future, save the future
Can't imagine what they goin' through but yup
I loved people, I lost people
Let's deliver us all from all evils
This gotta stop, no part 2 sequels
When we gonna realize that we're all equal

[Chorus]
Spread your tiny wings to the skies that we are from
Let our hope just reign, let us know we're not alone
Spread your tiny wings over all you love and know
All my queens and kings, don't worry you're going home
You're going home, you're going home
You're going home, you're going home

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
Man, the way this world is going
You'd expect that it's always something
But hope is all we got
Yea, we lose that then we're left with nothing
Tell your family you love 'em
Cause the things that we've been facing
As a people, as a nation, as a world, no explanations
And we hope, and we pray, tryin' to make it through today
Cause tomorrow's never promised and we searching for a way
That we can make it all add up
Up in this crazy world we livin' in
So for the parents who will never see their kids again
Just know our thoughts are with you
And our hearts are broken too
And all those little angels
They'll be watching over you
The teachers that were lost
Y'all are heroes now
Not sure if God was listening
But he gon' hear us now
Regardless of religious views
We all gon' pray for you
I know we're hurtin' now
But we all gon' make it through
Soon as I heard the news
I knew I had no choice at all
CT I love you
And I'm proud to be a voice for y'all
So let's all stand together
Reach up and touch the sky
And keep every memory alive of those we lost
Till we see 'em on the other side
Show our neighbors we love 'em
Really reach out and touch 'em
And light a candle for the angels that's flying above 'em

[Chorus]
Spread your tiny wings to the skies that we are from
Let our hope just reign, let us know we're not alone
Spread your tiny wings over all you love and know
All my queens and kings, don't worry you're going home
You're going home, you're going home
You're going home, you're going home
You're going home, you're going home
You're going home, you're going home</pre>
