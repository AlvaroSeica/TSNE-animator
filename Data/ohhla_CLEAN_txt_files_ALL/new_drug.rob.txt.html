Hey, what's up
It's the homey Lil' Rob
Back to clear some shit up, you know
People be stealing my shit
And making money off it
And you know who you are

Hey, Mr. Postman, do me a favor
Deliver the letter, the sooner the better
Blew you vatos away like a feather
Familia Records, chale, whatever
People don't know, and I'm not one to talk
But I gots to clear my name, for the shit that you dropped
Lil' Rob - Still Smokin' 
Homey who the fuck you joking?
Burning Raza with my name, use you brain, you're insane
It's a shame you're not ashamed to being lame
Are you Raza? No, then change what you claim
Be proud of who you are, and not who you wanna be
I don't wanna work with you, why do you wanna work with me?
I'm not your artist, so focus on them
If they're not making you money and you're broke, that's on them
But, to take the shit the way you did
You remind me of a jealous little desperate kid
No llores

No llores
You wonder why I broke left
If I would of stayed I would of left broke (simon)

You wonder why I broke left (you wonder why)
If I would of stayed I would of left broke (I would of left broke)

No llores
You wonder why I broke left (you wonder why)
If I would of stayed I woulda left broke (simon)

You wonder why I broke left (you wonder why)
If I would of stayed I would of left broke (and that's no joke)</pre>
