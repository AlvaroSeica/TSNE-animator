Song:   Throw Your Nickels Up
Typed by: illalready@gmail.com

Throw your nickels up!
I fell asleep too deep
Scarred from the sickle cuts
Looking at the face of my maker
Seen through the eyes of a stranger
Endangering your hindsight
Rearrange your position
Get your mind right
Change lanes if your mission is the limelight
That'll shine bright for a second of the nightlife
Not long enough to build reflection of the mind's might though

Rest my case closed
In between the passion and pesos
Son, I pay dues like I pay tolls
On the interstate going in between shows
And people tell me that's how it goes
So if you want to ride
With some Gnawledge on your side
Take Gnotes
Just a good way to get votes
Home to the East and West coast

Man, I'm about to post like a thumb tack
Stuck to the map
And rock bells like a hunchback
Dumbed of the rap after mass
Rise in the aftermath of mayhem
Floating on a sound wave to show you what I'm saying
I'm not even here to play games
If I want to demonstrate skill
I don't have to name names
Make sure that this stays anonymous
Drink up
Your cups are bottomless

All my people on the right
If your seeing through the light that's blinding
And you can get your mind on shine
Say "Hell Yeah!"
All my people on the left
Still breathing in this mess
With a demon on their back
But a heart inside their chest
Say "Hell Yeah!"

You're being watched by a closed circuit camera
On every city block that you walk
Understand bro
Conversations documented
If you said it then you meant it
There's a list of every sentence
It's right next to what type of soup you buy
You don't think that they can spoon you lies?
It's the deuce double oh seven
Where the truth is never mentioned
Cuz atrocities are committed to your brethren

StopÂ…move!
I don't really have it left in me to call a truce
To tell the truth I'm only really hear to stop... you
So what you gonna do
When the masses mobilize
And choose to rise above the lies
Then we've got you
It's only a matter of time
I'm a catalyst who's shattering rhymes
Against weapons of mass consumption
Mass deception
Saying something
Asking questions
Creeping through the shadow
Sleeping in the sunlight
Creeping at the gallows
While the reaper gets his guns right
Seeking a change of position
Against the same evil forces  that keep history in repetition
So what you think the real problem is?
We're about to find out where the bottom is
I already asked you to keep this anonymous

All my people on the right
If your seeing through the light that's blinding
And you can get your mind on shine
say "Hell Yeah!"
All my people on the left
still breathing in this mess
With a demon on their back
but a heart inside their chest
say "Hell Yeah!"</pre>
