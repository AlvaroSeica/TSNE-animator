Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
Go you, go you
Long hair, don't care, my baby so rude
So smooth, so true
You did slum nights, wearin them horse shoes
My madam queen don't do the dutch
But roll papers, dope way as she used to fuck
Don't ho save er, show haters her dude is up
Like go Lakers! Floor seats to 2 of us
I hold her hand when walkin
Let er know everything, she understands our talkin
I got er heart, no other man had caught it
Take a look at that rock that's on her hand, I bought it

[Chorus]
I love a lady out the projects
Damn, baby you got it, body is so exotic
Solid 'cause she real
Her broke pockets for some heels, her pocket books is ill
She gotta be the deal

[Verse 2]
Glass of wine, blow lime, let's groove out
Waste no time, slow grind, my tool out
I got er her own when her mom said move out
Got good brains and that's besides my booze mouth
She in love, that's I'm talkin bout
Star struck, VVM face, her eyes harded out
No matter where, we get the red carpet out
They flickin out when we move, like the corner's out
She my main slash day one
Keep me well grounded, always now where I came from
Way I'm soundin, move can never change hun
Inhale wild piff, bottles of champagne bruh

[Chorus]
I love a lady out the projects
Damn, baby you got it, body is so exotic
Solid 'cause she real
Her broke pockets for some heels, her pocket books is ill
She gotta be the deal

[Verse 3]
Ayo Keisha, she was a keeper
Threesome, she'd want Tameeka
In fact was the best, giving head, get er wet
And next she was my best, she got my name all on the chest
Tell me if you seen er, I was lookin for prenups
Wanda was a charmer, never let me get up on er
With Casey, she hate to taste me so she hooked me up with Stacey
Stacey fuckin Crazy but Crazy was fuckin crazy
Booked me a few shows, got her thinkin that she made me
All for one, not she lazy
Quick to flip the bricks and well bitch I'm fit to let go
Had a nig connect my bitch, turn into Diego
Couple of dollars and now she sniffin up the yayo

[Chorus]
I love a lady out the projects
Damn, baby you got it, body is so exotic
Solid 'cause she real
Her broke pockets for some heels, her pocket books is ill
She gotta be the deal</pre>
