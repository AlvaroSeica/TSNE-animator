I put on...
I put on...
I put on...
I put on for my city, on, on for my city
I put on for my city, on, on for my city
I put on for my city, on, on for my city
I put on for my city, on, on for my city

[Young Jeezy]
When they see me off in traffic, they say Jeezy on some other shit
Send them pussy niggas running straight back to the dealership
Me I'm in my spaceship, that's right I work for NASA
This 7H is not a fraud, call that my bitch my bodyguard
Call that bitch your bodyguard? Yeah that's my bodyguard
Own a lot of jewelry, Young don't so security
What's whiter than a napkin harder than a dinner plate?
If you want it come and get it you know I stay super straight
Ran up in my spots and now I'm working out the super 8
Know you niggas hungry come and get a super plate
Y'all sing happy birthday yeah I got that super cake
100 karat bracelet I use it like some super bait

[Hook  X2]
I put on for my city, on, on for my city
I put on for my city, on, on for my city
Put on - Eastside
Put on - Southside
Put on - Westside
Put on... 

[Young Jeezy]
Hat back, top back aint nothin but a young thug
HK's, 8 k's I need to join a gun club
Big wheels, big straps you know I like it super sized
Passenger's a red bone her weave look like some curly fries
Inside's fish sticks outside's tartar sauce
Pocket full of cel-e-ry imagine what she telling me
Blowing on asparagus the realest shit I ever smoked
Ridin' to that trap or die the realest shit I ever wrote
They know I got that bro-cco-li so I keep that glock with me
Don't get caught without one comin from where I'm from
Call me Jeezy Hamilton flying down Camelton
So fresh, so clean, on my way to Charlenes

[Hook  X2]

[Kanye West] 
I put on...
I put on...
I put on...
I put on for my city, I put on for my... 
I put on for my city, I put on for my city, on ... 

I feel like there's still niggas that owe me checks
I feel like there's still bitches that owe me sex 
I feel like this but niggas don't know this stress
I lost the only girl in the world that know me best
I got the money and the fame and that don't mean shit
I got the Jesus on the chain man that don't mean shit
Cuz' when the Jesus pieces cant bring me peace
Yo I need this at least, uh, one of Russell's nieces on
I let my nightmares go I put on everybody that I knew from the go
I know hoes that was frontin' when they knew we was broke
They say damn Yeezy Yeezy you don't know us no more
You got that big fame homey and you just changed on me
You can ask Big Homey man the top so lonely
I ain't lyy-iing so lonely I aint lyyy-iing
Let me see what we have tonight what we have tonight
I'm high as a satellite (satellite) I see those flashing
lights (flashing lights)
Cuz' every night, every night
