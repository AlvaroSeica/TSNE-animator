[Cee-Lo Green]
It's looking like a limb torn off
or all together just, taken apart
We're willing through an endless fog
We are the everliving, ghost of what once was

[Chorus]
But no onnnnnnnnnnne
is ever gonna love you more than I do
No one's gonna love you more than I do

[Cee-Lo Green]
And anything to make you smile
It's a better side of, of you to admire
But they should never take so long
Just to be over then, back to another one

[Chorus]

[Cee-Lo Green]
Someone should have warned you

[Interlude]
When things start splitting at the seams and now
the whole thing's tumbling, down
Things start splitting at the seams and now...
If things start splitting at the seams and now
It's tumbling, dowwwwwwwwn, hard

[Cee-Lo Green]
Did anything to make you smile
You are, the everliving, ghost of what once was
I never want to hear you sayyyyyyyy
that you're better off, or you liked it that way

[Chorus] - change "but no one" to "cause no one"

[Cee-Lo Green]
They really should have warned you
