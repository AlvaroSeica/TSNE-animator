[Intro: J. Cole]
Hey, Cole World, yeah

[J. Cole]
Yeah, e'rybody got a bad side, drop, let me see that shit
What you say Cole ain't hot; what? Where you read that shit?
You believe that shit? All cause some lame nigga tweet that shit?
Have you seen my shows? Have you seen my hoes? If I wasn't hot would they be so thick?
Huh... guess not, got the game in a headlock
I'm blastin at, I'm laughin at you old niggaz, Redd Foxx
Don't mind me boy I'm red hot, huh, aw nigga they not
I'm over here, I'm over there, I'm everywhere, they not
(I said) You'll never play me, nice try, ballin in a nice spot
No more Mr. Nice Guy, hello Mr. Nice Watch
You don't want no problems, put yourself in a tight spot
So, you could look but don't touch, I'll stay on my toes like the White Sox
Cause

[Chorus: J. Cole]
It cost me a lot, my chain and my watch
They say time is money but really it's not
If we ever go broke girl then time is all we got
And you can't make that back, no you can't make that back
So let's ball while we here, let's ball while we here
Like ain't no tomorrow, like ain't no next year
Drink away all our problems, make it rain with no care
Like I'll make that back, fuck it I'll make that back
Go... ahh, nice watch (uh-huh)
... ahh, nice watch (I know)
... ahh, nice watch
No more Mr. Nice Guy, hello Mr. Nice Watch

[J. Cole]
Stack on black, huh, I ain't never been a high roller
Now it's racks on racks, uh, never thought that I would ride Rover
But I'm back on track, add to the fact that I never really drive sober
+Cole World+ but I'm hot as shit, do that mean that I'm bipolar?
Young black and gifted, I rap/wrap like it's Christmas Eve
Coach wouldn't let a nigga off the bench, no wonder why I didn't quit the team
But, I'm cut from a different sleeve, +Cole World+ so the wrist'll freeze
Hurry up with your pictures please, I gotta make history

[Chorus]

[Jay-Z]
Yeah, got a Hublot I call it Tebow, I strap that bitch with a gator band
Y'all niggaz ball half-time, y'all niggaz like the Gator band
Y'all niggaz need a time-out, who got these niggaz all wound up?
Cocksucker I'm 7-30, y'all know where y'all niggaz gon' wind up?
No more Mr. Nice Guy, hello Mr. Nice Watch
Only but a matter of time 'fore I hit y'all niggaz with a nice shot
Y'all niggaz bet' not call the law, get no blood on my Audemar
Meanin y'all bet' not waste my time, when y'all ready I'll take you all to war
Meanwhile I'm just choppin off doors, put the front on the back cause I'm back and forth
Put the front on the back of the 'bach like a boss so I'm frontin on niggaz when I'm backin off
Uh, what up Cole? Showtime, let these niggaz know
Adjust your Roleys on these muh'fuckin hoes, whenever you ready, go!

[Outro: J. Cole]
It cost me a lot, my chain and my watch
(Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, ahh, nice watch)
If we ever go broke girl then time is all we got
(Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, ahh, nice watch)</pre>
