[No Malice]
In that all too precious, blood I am covered
This is for you, dearly beloved
For every D-boy on the corner, Mason jar in the cupboard
This is for you, dearly beloved
If I COULD, I would take back every foolish word that I uttered
I owe that to my momma, knowing how much she suffered
Her first born taken by that 80s' Holocaust
Then I turned around, served it Ã  la carte
I'm all apart inside, can't breathe 
Chokin on my windpipe every time my nephew say he wanna rhyme
And I know he got to question why I don't give him my blessing
That's only because I love you like you mine
And I refuse! We lose another, your father's my brother
Them pipe dreams, let 'em +Burn+, I can't +Usher+
You in this game, knowin it's a lion's den
I tell you like I tell my own son, reach higher than

[Chorus: No Malice] (Jon Bibbs)
Chasin that American dream
But life ain't always what it seems
(So I had to bury that)
Shoulda known it was a scheme
Any time he took one for the team
(Man, I had to bury that!)
Half of my homies is in the bing
But y'all don't see behind the scenes
(Lord knows I had to bury that!)
Out there hustlin that Medellin
David Banner, all I saw was GREEN

[No Malice]
They would have you think I am at odds with my sibling
How they look alike, yet bear no resemblance
All hail the Clipse and all of their magnificence
But I cannot deny my deliverance
It is no coincidence, that God choose to use my brethren
To show the magnitude of these ties I'm severing
The fight's fixed, especially ya top 10
Can you trust a list in which Pusha isn't mentioned in?
REALLY? Who copped a milli of them kilograms?
Broke 'em down, chopped 'em up like a ceiling fan
We gave you truth, y'all ain't want it, y'all wanted SPOOF
Now I'm Holy Ghost filled like I'm haunted
A warning, it's time to fall before Him on your knees
It seem like everything that's real is what you won't believe
Please, it's time to let go of the past
of the best duo ever, I guess I am an +OutKast+
