[Intro: judge]
Sentence should now-now be pronounced, I'll ask that you stand for sentence, please.
Mr. {*censored*} it is the sentence of the court that your custody be committed to the department of corrections
for confinement of the {*censored*} state prisons without possibility of parole for the remainder of your life.
You may be seated...

[Rick Ross]
War ready... you got shooters, I've got shooters
We've got money
Let's do what them other niggas can't do
MasterMind, uhh, uhh
Nigga got a thousand guns, nigga (Dade County)
If money is power, nigga, then I've got millions of power, nigga
(Hahahaha! Miami shit) fuck with me nigga, huh?

17, I was chargin' niggas 17
Ridin' clean, youngest nigga in the MedellÃ­n (WHOOOO!)
Bomber green, in that thang, in the middle lane
Did some thangs for my niggas which I can't explain (WHOOOOOO!)
Versace slippers, 20 chains, bitch I'm Dana Dane
Put a patch over your eye, fuck with my petty change
Fuck what you heard, for that bird I'm a dirty nigga
Laid to rest by the one you thought was workin' with ya
War ready, the game just wanna take my life
War ready, pussy boy we all could die tonight
War ready, fast cash above the law
War ready, gas mask when them choppers talk

[Chorus: Tracy T]
Killas, on the, front, line, when you're, war, ready (war, ready, nigga)
Chopper, shoot a, thousand, rounds, when you're, war, ready (bang, bang, bang!)
Just a-nother, mama, cryin', when you're, war, ready (war, ready, nigga)
Just a-nother, homi-cide, cause we, war, ready (AY! AY! AY!)
Killas, on the, front, line, when you're, war, ready  (war, ready, nigga)
Chopper, shoot a, thousand, rounds, when you're, war, ready (bang, bang, bang!)
Just a-nother, mama, cryin', cause we, war, ready (war, ready, nigga)
Just a-nother homi-cide, when you're, war, ready (war, war, war)

[Young Jeezy]
A coward dies a thousand deaths, a real nigga dies but one (It's Tha World, nigga)
21 gun salute out of the top of your drop top coupe (war, ready)
I know a lot of niggas gon' hate to see this
Yeah I wish Shake could see this
I'll never fall for what I stand for; this here for Nando
We could live today, blood and die tonight, cuz

+Box Chevy+ hit the block, run the whole 50 shots, you just poppin' 'til you know you can't pop 'em no more (war, ready)
We done came through the block and sold many color drops and these mothafuckas think you can't drop 'em no more (war, ready)
All right, a nigga put some change on your head, damn right, fuck around, clear my safe out (clear my safe out)
I got a few digi scales and a couple Denzels and you mothafuckin' right, this a +Safe House+ (that's riiight~!)
Give me the K and a shovel, I'll bury that nigga (bury that nigga), be his pallbearer, so I can carry that nigga (carry that nigga)
What you gonna hit him with, the Glock or the chop? Look, I wouldn't give a fuck if they were sharin' that nigga (war, ready)
You mothafuckas out here always talkin' 'bout what another mothafucka said (said)
Yeah I got that FNH when that mothafucka finna hostin', I ain't out here to mothafuckin' play (nah)
Why these fuck niggas always cryin' 'bout somethin'? Either you're livin' like a ho or you're dyin' 'bout somethin'
Try to let that Rollie breathe but it's hidin' in my sleeve like that motherfucker timid or shy about somethin' (ha-haaa!)
Tomorrow ain't promised, nigga roll up that weed, gotta stay strapped to live the life I lead
Start your own alphabet with all them G's, open up a hundred doors with all them keys (YEEEEAH)
Yeah we live for them coupes but we dyin' by the gun, missed his court date, now my nigga on the run (AY!)
Big shit poppin' in his pocket like a lighter, shit bag leave a grown nigga in a diaper (daaamn)
Hangin' out the Rolls, on your mark, get set, let it go, yeah hold that bitch steady
When that ritalin get to rushin' and them drums get to bussin'; yeah, I hope you pussy niggas war ready

[Chorus] - first 1/2 w/ Jeezy ad-libs

[Rick Ross]
I got a thousand niggas; nigga ready to die by mine, nigga
HUH! What yo money like?

Follow in my footstep (WHOO) I was born to die a soldier
Nigga couldn't walk a mile, found him naked in the river
Shout out to the Vice Lords (WHOO) shout out to my Blood, nigga
Shout out to them GD's, where that Crip love, nigga?
Shout out to them dopeboys, owe it to the plug, nigga (WOO!)
I could die a thousand times, will never die a fuck nigga
Shoutout to my city, too, my clip hold a 62
Ridin' down on 63, rest in peace to Flew Da Coop
Heroin and quinine, cut that bitch a thousand times
Phone call said he need a brick, I text him back, "Come stand in line" (HUH!)
You went out of town so I had to wack your bitch (bitch!)
Never came back, pussy boy, go die a bitch

[Chorus]

[Rick Ross - over Chorus]
War ready...
If you ain't ready to die about it, don't even mention it to a nigga like me, baby
I went from nothing, nigga, to $60 million, nigga
Walking around in my motherfuckin' Belaire RosÃ©, Evander Holyfield's estate, nigga
$25 million, nigga, $6 million in marble, $2 million in drapes
Another 5 in chandeliers, 230 acres, nigga

[Outro: Rick Ross]
That's just one of the many properties, nigga
War ready; and I'm down to die 'bout that
We gon' ride 'bout that, so you know we ready to slide 'bout that
Cut that check, nigga, what yo money like, huh?
It's hard to go to war with $70 million, nigga, hah?
Read the obituary, nigga, print that motherfucker in Italian, hah?
What's a hassa? What's a HASSA? That's you, haha
I'm not gonna kill you, though, haha
I'm not gonna kill you, though, haha
Hey Black, kill this motherfucker {*several shots fire*}
