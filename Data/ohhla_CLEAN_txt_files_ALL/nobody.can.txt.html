[Canibus]
You know this rap game is a lot like high school
and high school is a lot like life
You see in life, you got to do things to set yourself apart from your peers
you need to identify the qualities that separate you from those around you
After all, isn't that what most people spend they lives trying to accomplish?
Wouldn't we all want somebody, somewhere later on down
the line to remember the things that were different about us?
Don't you understand? The more you fit in, the less you're noticed
That's how it is, for anyone to walk through life unnoticed as if they never mattered
could be a punishment worse than death, and at the same time
that punishment is the only way you could truly be free;
free from the things you want people to remember about you
but also free from the things you want them to forget
I don't know if that freedom exists for me anymore
And even though I dream about what it would be like
it's just a dream, because I realize now more than ever
that I can't have my cake and eat it too, no one can
And as time goes on, we will always be loved by some and hated by others
And whether the people who talk bad about you know it or not
they really save you from obscurity every time they mention your name
You see, anytime anybody ever talks about you, either directly or indirectly
they put a quarter in your immortal meter
They keep you alive, whether they want to or not
they practically do the opposite of what they want to do
which is forget you. I dedicate this song, to the day
when you motherfuckers finally figure it out
and the day that you bury me, and erase the memory of me
Here lies a man, who became forgotten to the world
in his search to the key for immortality
He never made an impact, he changed nothing
and his words meant nothing
He never contributed to the rap game;
he never gave you anything to talk about
He never existed, and he never made a difference
his name was nobody!</pre>
