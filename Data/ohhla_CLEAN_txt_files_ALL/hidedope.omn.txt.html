turn up my boom box, slap me five on ____
pull up my tub socks, I rock with adidas on top
pass me the hot piece, my crew is motley
heavy on the head nod shit, all my world wide posies
cop this, it's a new beginning, I'm out the cut
gorilla nut, strut, put um up if you don't give a fuck like us
I rep the underdogs, putting in work
with a new box of product and fresh pack of white tee shirts, yeah

people out there getting that money,
hide the dope and parts in case the narcs come
go getters roll with us, all my niggas say
hide the dope and parts in case the narcs come
there trying to ban mixtapes, what the fuck we say
hide the dope and parts in case the narcs come

we'll take the states to the island chains
from overseas with the japanese, put my expertise on your next release
let it circulate and build like mercury
strategize the spark of a movement certainly
everything is calculated perfectly
and carried out, you can check me on my website for my whereabouts
I'm there right now, planting seeds with the world breeds
the dopest dee jays the dopest emcee's
are unsigned and still pushing cd's
flip an order out the gate into 10 g's
smuggle it across the border in some long sleeves
sneak it right past customs, tax free

people out there getting that money
hide the dope and parts in case the narcs come
go getters roll with us, all my niggas say
hide the dope and parts in case the narcs come
there trying to ban mixtapes, what the fuck we say
hide the dope and parts in case the narcs come

follow a cell high, aim for the sky
cock back the desert eye, let um fly, let um fly
keep something set aside, be ready when the draught comes
if you got a word of mouth then get um out withought them
hand in hand transactions in large sums
we stuff duffle bags, put um in the trunk
the catalogs impressive, we got enough to press
the best of, its me on the cover throwing the west up

people out there getting that money
hide the dope and parts in case the narcs come
go getters roll with us, all my niggas say
hide the dope and parts in case the narcs come
there trying to ban mixtapes, what the fuck we say
hide the dope and parts in case the narcs come
