Song:   Give Me All Your Luvin'
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Intro]
L-U-V, Madonna
Y-O-U, you wanna

[Madonna]
I see you comin and I don't wanna know your name (L-U-V, Madonna)
I see you comin and you're gonna have to change the game (Y-O-U, you wanna)
Would you like to try? Give me a reason why; give me all that you got
Maybe you'll do fine, as long as you don't lie to me and pretend to be what you're not

[Chorus: Madonna]
Don't play the stupid game cause I'm a different kind of girl
Every record sounds the same, you've got to step into my world
Give me all your love and give me your love
Give me all your love today
Give me all your love and give me your love
Let's forget about time, and dance our lives away

[Intro]

[Madonna]
Keep tryin don't give up, that's if you want it bad enough (L-U-V, Madonna)
It's right in front of you, now tell me what you're thinkin of (Y-O-U, you wanna)
In another place, at a different time, you can be my lucky star
We can drink some wine, burgundy is fine, let's drink the bottle every drop

[Chorus]

[Nicki Minaj]
Give me all your love boy
You can be my boy, you can be my boy toy
In the nick of time, I can say a sicker rhyme
Cause it's time for change, like a nickel or a dime
I'm Roman!
I'm a +Barbarian+, I'm +Conan+
You was sleepin on me, you were dozin
Now move!! I'm goin in

[Bridge: Madonna]
You have all the L-U-V
I gave you everything you need (now move!)
Now it's up to Y-O-U
Are you the one, shall we proceed?

[M.I.A.]
Me it, licks, I'm so swag shit
Glad, no one gave you this
It's super sonic, bionic, uranium hit
So I break 'em off tricks
Let's pray that it sticks
I'ma say this once, yeah, I don't give a shit

[Chorus] w/ minor variations</pre>
