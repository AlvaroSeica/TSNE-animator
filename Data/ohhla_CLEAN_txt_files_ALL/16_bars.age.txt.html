Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

  What the fuck?  Yeah!
  Yo y'all niggaz get'cha rhymes up
  I'm sick of this shit, get your bars up niggaz
  Sixteen bars of death my niggaz
  Ay Planet, let's go, c'mon!

[Planet Asia]
All it takes is sixteen bars of death
Rain hail snow, I make the clouds drip to get you wet
And that's a bar no matter East to West
Don't get this rap shit twisted, I'ma star that'll meet your threats
And we can bet, cause if I go deep in death
Then it's a rap, face it, you could never beat the best man
And even as a little kid - niggaz knew I had it in me
cause the way I used to spit at the assemblies
And unless you remember me from now on
Everytime I spit then it's a special delivery
My world is of ability, women give neck willingly
Niggaz respect me lyrically - my, city is feelin me
From the inner to the optic jewels
From the beginnin to the endin I am not to lose
I'm not the fool, spit 'til no bars is left
And all y'all teams can feel my sixteen bars of death

[Chorus: Planet Asia]
Sixteen bars of death
Rap monster on cassette, never runnin out of breath
Yes, sixteen bars of death
And when I spit I spit bars 'til it ain't none left
  [repeat 4X]
  Get your bars up (yeah) get your bars up (yeah)

[Planet Asia]
In the apartment, the artist get it started for hours
Heartless, like the department of the water and power
Yeah - fuck your hot showers, and while you watchin the fight
I cut your cable just to show who really got power
Now I'm, minutes from ass-kickin sessions
Asswipe, we tax niggaz like Pacific Gas &amp; Electric
Bar spitter, {?} cigar splitter, tar getters
Hard-hitter hater niggaz wanna war with us
But get your bars up, cause niggaz know about me
and they know about my squad, so as far as us
I ain't got to answer the shit, so if you see me in the club
keep your mouth closed and dance with a bitch
Cause I'm bout to be the hood philanthrophist; get down or lay down
And how I got up in the spot wasn't an accident
Just love blood tears and sweat, and large respect
And sixteen bars of death, yeah

[Chorus]
