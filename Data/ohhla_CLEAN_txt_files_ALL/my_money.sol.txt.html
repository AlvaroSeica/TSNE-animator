[Solomon Childs]
Say sexy, I would like to get to know you
But my mama said, I shouldn't speed
Your last man had a bald spot like Rasheed
Centipede, your body baby, work it like a centipede
You the drill sergeant, and I'm the private
And I'mma stay on my job, like a real man
You ain't got to listen to nobody, man
About your man, baby, listen lady
Or even sing to you like Tyrese
Every other day, all kinds of exotic treats
Summertime, Bentley soft top
Gucci loafers on, South American rocks
By the beaches, and we ain't gotta come back til they sent us subpeonas

[Chorus: Solomon Childs]
My money long...
I'll buy you a house... a car...
Some diamonds... and a little dog...
My money long...
I'll take you where your man can't take you...
I'll buy you what your man can't afford...
Baby, roll with me... you'll never be bored...
My money long...

[Solomon Childs]
Nowadays I'm holding my own, little mama
I'm grown, I see the stubborn in you
Your independant ass, I just pray you make it home
Cuz this a big city and you ain't but so big
But you don't care, cuz in your eyes
You can make it here, you can make it anywhere
But I need you to understand
That you rolling like the President's wife now
And all kinds of dudes gon' test you, now
All kinds of girls, gon' test you now
Make me look out to be a dog
When I just wanna kiss
From the princess, like I'm a frog
My money long

[Chorus 2X] </pre>
