If I had things my way, I wouldn't be a zero
Rather be respected like Pierre Ferro
Every album I touch 5 mics
Id be on MTV with Tommy Lee ridden dirt bikes
Me and Fred Durst cooking brought worst
And one of those huge barbecues with them bonny skirts
I wouldn't need a baracade at my shows
cause it would be nothing but celeberty friends the first 10 rows
id have a 90 pound sled on my arm
who likes like a little skinny dude with a perm
but shes a super model and she works in Brazil
and her daddy places pool on the isle of ???
I remember when I met at a party with my friends
I sent her a rose with a note "May I have this dance?"
Jeckel whut? I don't even know who they are
If I had things my way, I'd be a superstar

Chorus:
I'm so famous I'm so sweet
I'm so neat I can't be beat
call my one time
I'm so fashon, I'm divine
I'm so famous I'm so sweet
I'm so neat I can't be beat
call my one time
I'm so fashon, I'm divine

i got a call this morning Denis Rodman &amp; Carson Daily
they want to meet me up for lunch at the ????
and I don't even know them people
but we famous, so we consider each other equal
where am I from? oh yea Detroit city
i remember that tiny little town, so itty bitty
i think I used to have some family there
infact I wonder if.rmmm... anyway, jauque do my hair
sniffing cocaine off of crystal counter top
kissy face, sucking on her ruby red lolly pop
Shaggy Who? watch me clean up the ghetto
i sleep on a matress sprinkled with rose pedals
make my music, write my song ill come sing it
and when the royalty check comes, betta bring it
mr masoose come and rub me down gently
mom hers the keys, go and wash the ???

(Fast Talking I Can't Even Make Out)

Superstar....
(Chorus)

I'm like a zerko, I suck my drummers dick
i aint gay or nothin, I just did it for kicks
i play the crazy rock star it helps my rep
u shoulda seen me at the movie premire with johny depp
i love hollywood partys, I live like a star
ill kiss ur ass, even if I don't know who u are
ill jump in your pictures and ill get in your way
I'm annoying as fuck, I'm like that one kid from Sugar Ray
do I remember Twiztid? of course I do, Twisted Sister, They used to play with
Motely Crue
oh you mean them rapper kids that were down with me?
no, I don't recall, excuse me, security!
i don't need old friends, I'm way bigger
sorry, my phones ringin, its Tommy Hilfiger
ill see u when I see if I remember who u are
after all, your talking with the superstar

(Chorus)</pre>
