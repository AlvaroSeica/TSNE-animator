A-hem~!
'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the hood
Not a creature was stirring, so everything was all good
The stockings were hung - by the chimney so neat
In hopes that St. Nicholas, would come to our street
My nerves were stirring, I just couldn't get to bed
while dreams of new trinkets, just danced in my heads
And mamma in her nightgown, and I in my stocking (cap)
Had just settled down from a long day of shopping
When out on the stoop, there arose such a fuss
I sprang from the bed, to see what was up
Away to the window, I flew - like in a hurry
Tore open the shutters, and I noticed snow flurries
The moonlit glow, of the new-fallen snow
Gave the lustre of mid-day, to all the cars below
When what to my wondering eyes, should appear
but a miniature sleigh, and eight little deer
With a little old driver, so lively, so quick
I thought to myself NAHHH - can't be St. Nick!
More rapid than crackheads, his carriers they came
And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name
Now, as a man, raised in the ghetto so hard
My senses, they're heightened, so I'm always on guard
I, put on my glasses, and I grabbed my old bat
For if this is a burglar, I know how to handle that
I never imagined, a sleigh that could fly
so quickly, I dismissed my sight - as a lie
But, up to the roof-top, the reindeer they flew
With the sack full of toys, and a dude in a red suit
And then, in a twinkling, I heard 'em on the roof
The prancing and patting of each little hoof
As I drew in my head, and was turning around
I looked up the chimney, and guess who was comin down
He was dressed all in fur, his shoes they still shined
and although he had traveled, through such dirt and grime
a bundle of gadgets he flung on his back
And he looked like a peddler, just openin up his pack
His eyes-how they twinkled! His dimples, how merry!
His cheeks were tomatoes, his nose, like a cherry
The beard of his chin was as white as some cotton
I put down my bat, as if I had forgotten
But the stump of a pipe, he clenched within his teeth
And the smoke, it encircled his head - like a wreath
I instantly thought, that was someone just joking
So I grabbed his pipe, and I whispered no smoking
This jolly old man, I saw him, yes I did
But I hadn't believed in him, since I was like a little kid
He placed his fat finger, in front of his lips
And then turned to my cookie, my milk, and my list
He spoke not a word, but I knew the deal
I got so excited, cause Santa is real~!
Thought he was silent, but his motions were strong
and he wouldn't give presents, unless I got gone
So I went back to bed, smiling from ear to ear
My belly warm and full, bursting with Christmas cheer
We woke up that morning, with a yawn and stretch
and no one was readym for what we saw next
All the presents, that I knew I would see
The boxes, with the bows, sittin under that tree
But my mom was sad, so I asked her "What's wrong?"
The tree, the gifts, our Christmas is gone
Could it be true, that my hunches were right?
The jolly old man who went bump in the night
was not St. Nick, but some sort of imposter?
And that we were struck, by a holiday robber?
He took the PlayStations, our bikes, TV's
Nintendo DS's, the coats with long sleeves
This expert magician, was smoother than silk
He even devoured my cookies and milk
Though I was upset, that he'd broke in our home
He made ONE mistake, he took my iPhone!!
And thanks to the insight, and brains of Steve Jobs
Find My iPhone, activates when you're robbed
And when the time came, to talk to the police
Thanks to technology, this cat's off the streets
So always lock your doors and remember, sleep light
Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night
... and to all a good night</pre>
