Rest In Peace...JD(JD)(echo)
We doin' this live from Brooklyn,via satellite
 
[Chorus]
You know you really like it,you know you
You know you really like it,you know you
(yeah) You know you really like it,you know you
You know you really like it,you know you
You know you (alright) really like it,(look) you know you
You know you
 
[Verse 1]
Man, I run up on you with karate chop
Got you fallin out your A-di-das screamin E-AHH-AHH
You ain't seen it 'til I rocked the spot
Watch the stars as I connect the dots
That's how it is player; that's the game, player
You'll see God as you gaze at an ash trayer
Don't hate the gun hate the shooter
Don't hate the sword, hate the swinger
Cause I'm something like a (phenom-e-non)
I hit you with a beam of light like (phenom-e-non)
I got a flow that'll probably (go on-and-on)
'Til the fat lady starts to (yawn-and-yawn)
Haha,so don't go there,you cannot hold air/AIRE
I will escape through the grips of your fist,ah
And that will be a stupid move on your part
And now you gotta live/leave with a limp
OK,let's separate the blues from the pink
I can break it down from A to Zinc
I can snatch your girl with just one wink
I think fat boy got game,don't you think?
 
[Chorus]
You know you really like it,you know you
You know you really like it,you know you
You know you really like it,you know you
You know you really like it,you know you
You know you really like it,you know you(alright)
You know you
 
[Verse 2]
You should crawl before you walk;you should think before you talk
That's the order!
Don't worry ma,she's coming home with me and i'mma be so nice to your daughter
Come on dude i perfected rap
You ain't did shit,you perfected crap
It's like we graduated and you left back
You wasn't shooting bullets,you shot craps
-Plus- you got robbed for that
You said he got a gun,where the target at?
I'm old school like a starter hat
You arm facts,I'm the -ormonand-,do the knowledge
Look dude(Look dude),I'm nice(ha)
'Cause i always beat the odds
I admit:I love the Suicide Girls but Lucifer has gotten me closer to God
You wanna see me-that's a facade
Shorta difficult;maybe hard
My flow's cold like a St. Bernard
If this was a casino I'll pull your card
I'll pull your card
I'll pull your card
 
[Chorus][x2]
You know you really like it,you know you
You know you really like it,you know you
You know you really like it,you know you
You know you really like it,you know you
You know you really like it,you know you
You know you</pre>
