Loop Troop 99' David vs. Goliath
CosM.I.C, Supreme, Promoe, DJ Embee
Check it out! (What?)

Hated by everyone
(There is no way that we can rock after them)
Hated by everyone

[Cos.m.i.c]
Yo all I see is MC´s spreading wackness, preaching slackness
but yo bullshit you couldn't make me doing one track less
unless you take me out physicly
couse mentally youre 2000 years behind with your phonedelivery
acctualy your cast is like an archelogical discovery
from ancient times way beyond known history
I´m CosM.I.C and my troop wont do it your way
we rock live make firealarms go off from norway to broadway
MC´s in the hallway stand by
microphone connected network can't you see its a busy line yo
I aint got time to deal with jealousy
cause having that disease inside of me been killing me
plus fans been feeling me from cities to farms
all around this God's forsaken planet we walk upon
bring it on I break you down easy like ?
Cosmic the audio rumblepak in your headphones
Loop Troop hated by everyone
(There is no way that we can rock after them)
Hated by everyone
(There is no way that we can rock after them)

[Supreme]
It aint no way you can rock after these MC´s
no way you make heads bob like these and beats(?)
and please you dont want beef you dont wanna try
even with that extra cromosone I think you know why (Y)
Supremes watch we put some extra work on the make-up
like Sway and Tech we gotta show the makeups we make suckers wake up
see Im a floorfiller youre a floorkiller for sure
the only way you move the crowd is out the door
the poor flow and off-beat delivery
facing your discjockey constantly mumbling "hey yo fillin' me?"
not realy you'se like a playboyflick
it's never get to see no action, we want hardcore shit!
"Loop Troop" thats it! the rest of them sit quiet
David versus Goliath we turn the party to a riot
my crew will occupate the building barricade the doors
once the beat kicks in youll understand

Loop Troop hated by everyone
(There is no way that we can rock after them)
Hated by everyone
(There is no way that we can rock after them)
Schlook hated by everyone
(There is no way that we can rock after them)

Promoe:
yao Promoe´s a problem to the western world like the Y2K
even the presidents wife´s tooth ay
from sucking on my sugar daddy long dick all night
she wanna take it even I was like "allright"
I turn superstars into superhoes like Scotl la rock
Promoe´s an urban legend like Soda and Poprock
I dont cut like a cutler dickheads like bobby
if you dont bob it Loop Troop shit you cant stop it
you can cop it or copy it either ways you gotta have it
listening to our shit has becoming an alarming habit
of todays youth haha seekers of the truth
no wonder they stumble over this boygroup
sent from outher space to make the world better
cause MC´s act scizofrenic like the 23rd letter
mission: exterminate every wack rapper backstabber
get more fame and sell more records than ABBA
thats what Im after and if you go after
me on the microphone you get nothong but laughter
your DJ´s cutbacks stinking like butcracks
you got skills I got two words FUCK THAT

Loop Troop hated by everyone
(There is no way that we can rock after them)
Hated by everyone
(There is no way that we can rock after them)

yo a party aint a party if we dont get to rip
a hottie aint a hottie if I dont get to dip
a cypher aint a cypher if I did not spit
man we wont spit shit if the B aint sit(?)
