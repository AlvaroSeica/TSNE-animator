[Santigold]
We ain't got no name, no we ain't got no name
We're rough I understand, cause the status here to claim
Want it in my hand, don't want it in my head
Searching for a win, and a battle's on the way
Hustle make you high high, hustle make you low
Say I want, say I want, what I want they'll never know
Hustle make you high high, hustle make you low
All I know, all I know, all I got will make you go

[Chorus]
Al-wayyyyyys still game
We don't want the fame (we don't want it)
All I want the fame (we don't want it)
I siiiiiiing, we all sing (we don't want it)
We don't want the fame (we don't want it)
We don't want the fame

[Santigold]
We don't got no shame, no we don't got no shame
And look we got a plan, say we never play the game
Flowers in this bed, so our hearts can be misled
We're headed through they lane, holding close to what we said
Hustle make you high high, hustle get you low
Here it come, hold it tight, somehow we still let it go
Hustle make you high high, hustle get you low
I don't want, I don't want, maybe just a little gold

[Chorus]

[Santigold]
Oh, we really want the same you and I down low
Oh, we really want the fame fame
Oh, we really want the same you and I high low
Low~! We don't go for fame fame

[Chorus] - 2X</pre>
