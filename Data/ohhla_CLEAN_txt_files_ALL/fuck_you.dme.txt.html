[Drunken Master]
"Yeah, this goes out to you
And this goes out to you,
and for you, you, and the rest of your bitch-ass crew
Fuck you, you-know-what-I-mean?
Oh, it's finna go down
Drunken Master, nigga
Tired of playin' with you bitch-ass niggas, you-know-what-I'm-sayin'?
Check it out"

To all you jealous-ass tricks
mad because your woman be all on my dick,
fuck you nigga
To all the ridas who wouldn't ride,
but now they, uh, standin' on the outside
Heh-heh- Too late- Fuck you, nigga- Fuck you
And to that scarecrow lookin' bitch
over there off Jefferson, suckin' dicks
Turnin' tricks, ugly bitch- Fuck you
And to that playa hater on the block
broke and mad 'cause my shit don't stop,
fuck you- Go get a paper route or somethin', bitch-ass nigga
And to all you scandelous bitches
tryin' to fuck me for my riches,
bring that shit 'cause all I really wanna do is...
("Fuck you.") ...Then I'ma let my homeboy Ant,
then when we get done, we all gon' say,
'Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuck yoooooooouuuuuu!'
Fuck you, bitch
And to that judge at the Friend of the Court
that got me stressin' on this child support,
fuck you!

"And to anybody else out there who ain't bumpin' my shit,
fuck you- Fuck you- FUCK you!
I'll see y'all niggas on the next tape
And until we meet again..."

[Sample from Cam'ron's "Fuck You"]
"FUCK YOUUUUUU! Man, fuck you! (Laughing)"</pre>
