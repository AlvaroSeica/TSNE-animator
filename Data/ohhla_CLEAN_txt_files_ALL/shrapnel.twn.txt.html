[June Marx]
I walk on the battlegrounds
Fragments and scattered rounds
Paramilitary factions, abandoned towns
Where assassins found, in armed conflict
Launch rockets, war for large profit
Scarred beyond logic, still smell death aroma
Inner hell, post traumatic stressed soldier
Never sober, but focused on the mission task
Who provoke us, explosives and missiles blast
Choke your officials,laugh, blast walls with mortars
Coat where the pistol stashed, passed foreign borders
Masked armed enforcers, hijack a satellite
Gas-bomb your sources, fly past extraction site
Die fast, stand and fight, the weaponry blaze
I apply math, the cannons strike the enemy waves
The penalties paid, when the perils are crowned
Heavily slayed, left metal shells on the ground

[Lone Ninja]
Injuring the opposition, configuring a hostile mission
Got precision we crippling the competition 			
Squad is driven authoring in odd encryption
You're horror stricken, we clobber as we guard the prison		
You aren't forgiven, destruction on the frontline
You'll mourn your children, we cutting off the bloodline			
No running from the confines, I punish 'em the hunter's 
Gun'll numb spine I'm from the slums you sons is done it's crunchtime		
I'm rugged, shunning sunshine it's trench warfare
More sweat, more tears your death draws near				
Suggest yall fear in wretched afternoons
You mend your shrapnel wounds but breathless, trapped and doomed		
Intrepid, blast platoon, they're blown apart
venomous acid spewed with throwing darts        			
Lone and marx, they've surpassed your level,
Wave the flag of peril, raid with savage rebels				</pre>
