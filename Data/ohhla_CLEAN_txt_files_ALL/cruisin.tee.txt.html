[Intro]
Yo, yeah I'm on the way
Yeah I had to pick up the new car
Aight, ay, I'll be there in a minute
Ay you dressed?

[Chorus 2X: T.I.]
She had on purple panties, blue bikinis (yeah yeah)
And we were cruisin in my Lamborghini (yeah yeah yeah yeah)
She had on purple panties, blue bikiiiinis, yeah
And we were cruisin in my Lamborghini (cruisin in my Lambo)

[T.I.]
I pull up shawty came out the house with
her bra and panties with her jacket, that's her outfit
Her heels fly, they real high
She used to it, she's still fly
My ride new, her shoes on
She love to say she wanna take her top off
My car is orange, her toes too
R. Kelly on, I'm bumpin that old school
She's so so super bad, my motor's so super fast
Her feet up on the dash, I'm goin super fast
She's so relaxed, my windows black
Her legs wide open, can they see her while she's layin in her

[Chorus] - minus "She had on" at the start

[T.I.]
My tank full, the night young
Her eyes sayin, she wants some
She on one, the stars out
Wonder if she thinkin we can do it on the car now
I know she wanna play, it's written all on her face
What's in them purple bottoms? Girl I sure want a taste
Pulled over and opened the door, holdin that new Aventador
We parked somewhere dark, she laid on front and then I'm kissin on her

[Chorus] - minus "She had on" at the start

[T.I.]
(Shawty looks so goooood) She say she wanna do it in my ride
Looked so good in my ride what she was doin in my ride
(Shawty looks so good, good, good) She say she wanna do it in my ride
Looked so good in my ride what she was doin in my ride
(Shawty looks so goooood) So sexy I just let her get her ride on
Looked so sexy in my ride I just might buy her one
(Shawty looks so good, good, good) So sexy I just let her get her ride on
Looked so sexy in my ride I just might buy her one

[Chorus]</pre>
