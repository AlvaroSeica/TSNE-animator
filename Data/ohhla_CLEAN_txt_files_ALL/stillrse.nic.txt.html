[Nicki Minaj]
She said fuck Fendi, but I think she was playin
I heard she move them thangs, I think she fuckin Wayne
She call herself Lewinsky, that mean she give him brain
She tryin to be like Lil' Kim, her picture looks the same
Why she ain't signed with G-Unit? She from Queens right?
And what's her nationality? She Chinese right?
I mean she okay, but she ain't all that
She ain't the next bitch, tell that bitch fall back
See I'm a hater, I go hard, listen let's begin
You know her last name Minaj she a lesbian
And she ain't never comin out, like her currency
But every time she do a interview you know I run and see
She get me so sick it make me vomit
That's why I spend my time online leavin comments
And you know that I got some more haters with me, might hit up ThisIs50
MTV, hit up BET tell 'em pretty pretty please don't play Nicki

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Still I rise, still I fight, still I might crack a smile
Keep my eyes on the prize, see my haters tell 'em hi
One day you'll remember this, one day when we reminisce
Nothin I do ever is, good enough for the music biz

[Nicki Minaj]
Nothin I ever do is good enough for you... {*gun shots*}
Bitches is like crabs in a bucket
You see a bad bitch gettin shine, you should love it
Cause everytime a door open for me that means you
Just got a a better opportunity to do you
They don't understand these labels look at numbers as statistics
I lose, you lose, mines just logistics
Anyway; real bitches listen when I'm speakin
Cause if Nicki win, then all of y'all gettin meetings
(G'yeah~!) Ask L.A. Reid, ask Jay
Then hit up Universal, see what Sylvia Rhone say
Ask Craig Common, you can ask Chris
Lady when you're done, just salute bad bitch
Only underground bitch around that's duckin the paparazzi
In and out of town, be swervin the Maserati
Stay around the white like a Nazi
Pussy puh-puh-poppin on my poppers so the cops see
Bitches

[Chorus]

[singing over Chorus]
And still I rise, I'ma keep my eyes on the prize
Ohh, ohh
Yeah baby don't go down, no
It's for life for me
And when we reminisce, reminisce, babe</pre>
