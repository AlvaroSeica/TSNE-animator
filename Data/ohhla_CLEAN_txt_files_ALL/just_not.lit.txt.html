Don't mess with me, don't mess with me
Unless you're here to tell me you love me
Now, tell me you love me or tell me you love...
Well, anything will do, just not the truth...

With the door closed, I just find me a corner
To post up and start crying in till all the
Veins in my eyes run dry
Meditating on the latest stage in my life
Then I force closed what my mind sends upon the
Poor soul, which I've fought with the longest
Complaining about the life outside
When I made it how I carry hatred inside
That sends out signals switched and mixed emotion
Twisting up my feelings like an endless rope which
I'm planning to be hanging from tonight
Separating from the very state of living life
When no one can console me no more than try to hold me
And only seem to escalate the situation going
Directly to an end, so again, how can I say?
I'm living a drama so don't bother me or can I stay a-lone...

Don't mess with me, don't mess with me
Unless you're here to tell me you love me
Now, tell me you love me or tell me you love...
Well, anything will do, just not the truth...

Light switched up mean it's time I get down
And with a cartoon frown I start knocking things down
To the ground till I get a little attention
From somebody I can throw a tantrum at and be forgiven
Until the thought kicks in that I almost lost it
Tossing pictures in the light and causing darkness
Displaying all the rage I engage in
And made into a chain reaction phase I could've changed if-if
All that was lost that I caused
Could turn to be but all just a thought in the fog
But unluckily, rewinding and time aren't fond of each other
Not that I would bribe a simple bond
But I'm stuck between a wall and a fall and I'm definitely lost
How can a problem be solved if it's self and resolved into an end
But again, how can I say, I'm living a drama
So it's probably at best I stay a-lone...

Don't mess with me, don't mess with me
Unless you're here to tell me you love me
Now, tell me you love me or tell me you love...
Well, anything will do, just not the truth...

Mainly pain could never touch me
I was something like a stainless frame and then abruptly
The picture faded and memories painted
Began to dissipate and I appeared to be changing
But I ain't even recognize it till the end
And I was swiftly on my way beneath the ground for reprimand
Demons, I could see them and practically breathe in the
Atmosphere of evil, death in hours at a glance
But I'm not gon' let that stop me, no sir
I'd rather go home dead as a problem to both worlds
Than to live as the protégé of hatred and anger
Taking years away from moments like I'm flaming tobacco
Making an absolutely small thing a disaster
And I can't capture moods, just how they make me react
And nearing the end again, how can I say
I'm living a drama and most likely all the rest of my days a-lone...

Don't mess with me, don't mess with me
Unless you're here to tell me you love me
Now, tell me you love me or tell me you love...
Well, anything will do, just not the truth...</pre>
