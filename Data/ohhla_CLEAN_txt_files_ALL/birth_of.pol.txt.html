[Bigga Nolte]
This is my city and I been through it all
Shoot outs, fist fights, rough nights, the brawls
The club lights, kicking down a bathroom stall
See a fake nigga slam his head gainst the wall
Back then, I used to play ball with my friends
Now we all bag balls, just to make ends
It come hard, but they like when it stay soft
On blow off, when the Oilers hit the playoffs
That's how it is, hard core and grimy 
City of champions that's where you find me
The place where the boys be pullin' them stunts
And if you hit the club nights it be smellin' like blunts
And if you livin' life right, you be getting' it rich
The place where the hoes looking for pimps
Yes they all come quickly, yes they all roll with me
Cause I'm just too Gritie, yes I built this city
 
[Dirt Gritie]
I could recall when these parks never had fences
And you could leave your car running in the winter 
But it was much colder then
Seasons change, people age and the city expands 
Trades attract young men 
As the oil boom got us profiting
Though we might win some seems we lost it man
That good old community feeling 
Litter in the streets ain't quite as appealing 
And I wonder what's my part in this is
Bodies being found in apartments (damn)
That's my neighbour I don't talk to them 
But I always knew they would be a problem 
While the world gotta ask where's God been 
Artist such as myself struggle hard for spins
When the air waves cluttered with American trends 
 
[Chorus 1X - Dirt Gritie &amp; Oozeela]         
What up world can't you see, this ain't a melting pot it seems to be
A nice pool of diversity, ayo we built this city
I said we built this city, you know we built this city 
I said we built this city, ayo we built this city
 
[Dirt Gritie]
From China Town to Little Italy
Enoch and the Somalians on 107 street, we cleverly
Celebrate heritage in festival city
Elympia, aka E-Titty
Supple mother earth with the milk in her titties 
Been with her since my birth man I love this city
On heritage days the food is displayed
Scope the scene with my team and watch the booty displayed
 
[Arlo Maverick]
Sorry if my words dismantle, what's been put on a mantle
For every river valley, there's a fiend in the alley
And if Akeem still travels, his journey surely unravels
The membership between desolate and what we embattle
Should of read the preamble, but you chose to gamble
Now you scramble and pan handle picking pennies off the gravel
Disparity is poetry, but rarely do we notice these
Voids in society stemming from improprieties 
 
[Chorus 1X - Dirt Gritie &amp; Oozeela]         
What up world can't you see, this ain't a melting pot it seems to be
A nice pool of diversity, ayo we built this city
I said we built this city, you know we built this city 
I said we built this city, ayo we built this city 
 
[Arlo Maverick]                    
Good morning, Elympia, proud to meet you
Since these politicians won't, I'm a speak for you
How we re-elect a man who in a housing crisis
Sat back and wouldn't intervene on prices
Truth is, they own the properties we rent
So them dollars right there don't make sense
Then when we see crimes spread like cancer
They employ more police like as if that's the answer
Children lose innocence living on the streets
Showing up to school with no food eat
At recess instead of playing sports with their peers
They rummage through backpacks, hoping to find snacks
Now I love my city like BIG loved the Stuy
It's a shame that her birth only came when she died
I said I love my city like BIG loved the Stuy
It's a shame that her birth only came when she died
 
[Chorus 1X - Dirt Gritie &amp; Oozeela]         
What up world can't you see, this ain't a melting pot it seems to be
A nice pool of diversity, ayo we built this city
I said we built this city, you know we built this city 
I said we built this city, ayo we built this city</pre>
