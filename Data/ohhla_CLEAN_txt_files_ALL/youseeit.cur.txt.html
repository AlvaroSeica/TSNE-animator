Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
Poolside, too high, with three bitches
With four lives, I'm finna deal
Be out at 5 in that 600 Benz
Or that 750i. Ate 9 slices of that humble pie
But you know I still talk my shit right
What you tryna hear when you high?
What you wish they played on the radio
At least one time? It's cool though!
We getting major paper on the underground
You thought it was them other fools, though
It was us the whole time!
Them haters tryna deplete my shine like Venetian blinds
But sun do what the sun do rise
Hit the game like a Pinata tryna get a prize
Out here, riding, got me my bottom bitch
She give me the best top
A sex pistol getting shotgun in the drop
Best to wear your mittens, baby girl cause it's gettingâ¦

[Chorus]
My top down, Bitch in a bikini
My weed lye, I know you here screamin'
I'm here now, what's going on this evenin'
You could look the other way but I know you see me
I know you see it, I know you see it, I know you see it
Nigga, I know you see it
I know you see it, I know you see it
You could look the other way, but I know you see it

[Verse 2]
Cross-eyed, a few drinks
Cussing at the referee, his officiating stinks!
Spitta Andretti, I'm money on wheels
Like a Brink truck, way tough
Nigga never budge, that's my space! What
Marvel at my stance at your girl
What she think, she can't even respond
Cause her mind is now mine, fool
I ain't lying, let's just cross the couch
Sleeping with my shoes on just in case I have
to wake up and be out
Once again it's on
Mama bring my bong to the game room
With nothing but some panties on
And them Bape socks that I gave you
Never once on probation but your man's on his papers
Spendin' them, stackin' them, feelin' them
Wrappin' em, lightin' em, never passin' em
I rolled it up myself and I don't remember your help
That's how we do it now, fall through the jetset
Man, bring your ounce, this is new jack city
Baby girl rock them titties

[Chorus]
My top down, Bitch in a bikini
My weed loud, I know you hear screamin'
I'm here now, what's going on this evenin'
You could look the other way but I know you see me
I know you see it, I know you see it, I know you see it
Nigga, I know you see it
I know you see it, I know you see it
You could look the other way, but I know you see it</pre>
