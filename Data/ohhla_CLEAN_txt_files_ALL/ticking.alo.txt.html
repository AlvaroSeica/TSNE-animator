Song:   Ticking Bomb
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
The whole world's sitting on a ticking bomb
The whole world's sitting on a ticking bomb
So keep your calm and carry on
The whole world's sitting on a ticking bomb

[Verse 1]
The sun may never rise again
The question ain't if but when
The see will boil and the sky will fall
The sun may never rise again

The silent war has begun
We're staring down a loaded gun
No refuge found on solid ground
This human race can't be won

[Chorus]
The whole world's sitting on a ticking bomb
The whole world's sitting on a ticking bomb
So keep your calm and carry on
The whole world's sitting on a ticking bomb

And it's about to explode

(The whole world) [x4]

[Verse 2]
They're reaching in my pockets again
The ice we're standing on is thin
Making plans with greedy hands
They're reaching in my pockets again

The future is a dying art
Laying in a ditch in the dark
I need you here but all I hear (is)
The beating of a broken heart

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't wait to say goodbye
You're running out of time
Whatever you believe
It's easy to see

[Chorus]
The whole world's sitting on a ticking bomb
The whole world's sitting on a ticking bomb
So keep your calm and carry on
The whole world's sitting on a ticking bomb

And it's about to explode [x2]
(The whole world)
The whole world's sitting on a ticking bomb
And it don't care what side you're on
The whole world's sitting on a ticking bomb
So keep your calm and carry on
The whole world's sitting on a ticking bomb</pre>
