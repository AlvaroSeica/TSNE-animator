[A.L.T.]
(Verse 1)
I take you back in my past
I used to live life fast
And yo, it wasn't
Shit to let the .38 blast
I had it goin' on
With the bitches and hoes, too
Yo, come to think about it, so did my whole crew
We bumped the old school jams from the east coast
We was the baddest Mexicans out of East Los
Back in the days, many crews got hushed
It seems
Every night, me and my homies got
Rushed
But
We never back down, even if we got beat down
We came back next week to the same town
And we was ready for 'em
But they still figure
That they could do us
So Tiny pulled a steel trigger
I had a .38 special, not a A.K.
As we sped away, Tony G. was on KDAY
Mama told me, "Yo, Al, you better change your ways"
And I'm a take you way back in the days
And I'm a

Repeat Hook

(Verse 2)
Back in '83, we hit the party like fifteen deep
I kept the chrome in my jacket so nobody'll creep
Rappin' on the instrumental side
While Julio G. made the crossfade glide
Yo
I always had to carry me a half pint
Sippin' it and stirrin' on the mic
All night
My homie Tiny O. has had my back
And a trained pitbull that was trained to attack
And then I
Crack the 40 and it's on
Yo
Tilt the 40 and it's gone
Then
I might trip on a ex-freak
And I always had a flyer for the party on the next week
I seen my girl and I surprise her
Holdin' up the wall with some loc's and a tall can of Budweiser
Puffin' on a joint cause nobody smoke
Crack
And I'm a take ya to the days of
Way back

Repeat Hook Twice

(Verse 3)
Me and my primo, we was rollin' drop
And we was dodgin' the cops, cause we was lookin' for the crew
Spot
Rollin' in a six-deuce
I'm a target cause Mexicans never had a gang
Truce
Hit the spot, and it's dark
My primo said, "Park!"
Then we bailed out a '62 Skylog
Yeah
This vato rolled up
"Where you from, holmes?"
I dropped my 40
But Blanco said, "Stop, holmes"
I took two steps back
I could tell he was packed
Plus the skinny motherfucker's on crack
I turned
And dashed nine blocks
I heard nine shots
Now my primo's in a pine box
And if I go back and get him
I know
I can get him, squeeze the trigger on the nine
I hit 'em
And as I reminisce about my life
It's no wonder I still got my life
And I'm a take you back
