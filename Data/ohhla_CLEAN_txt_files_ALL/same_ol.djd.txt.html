Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Chorus: Kid Ink]
It feel like the same old story, everywhere that I go
And I don't really wanna do it all again tomorrow
So I'm trying to find something brand new
I'm sorry if you see me and I'm acting brand new
It feel like the same old bitches, same old haters
See me in the club, wanna come sit at my table
I'm trying to find something brand new
I'm sorry if you see me and I'm acting brand new
Motherfucker

[ScHoolboy Q]
No handouts for no niggaz
No handouts for no bitches
Killed the underground with my lifestyle
I'll let y'all fucks be the witness
But I'm losing my mind
On the block like 9 and a 9
Well until it got pined
You ain't know that it's something about time?
We didn't care about that
Remember the time I said I rapped?
Then the niggaz came after
Even the hoes was full of laughter
Flew back to the booth, went harder
Now node your heads to the product
Suck a nigga dick like he hotter
Slinky on the booty like your father
Beard look like Osama
Don't talk to me less about commas
Real shit, Go time get a meal tip
Save your compliments for the comments
Getting money is my assignment
Will still be in the set...

[Chorus]

[Cory Gunz]
Damn, these niggaz hatin, I can't understand
I'm your favorite's favorite, you the fan of a fan
I feel like if I fall off this boat I could walk
Y'all rap, Cory Gunz talk what he talk
Shorty said she coming, she bringing a friend
They ain't smoking with me, though, cause they didn't put in
Bitch, I be touring with Tunechi and Mack
Saluting Stunna on the way to the stage and way back
How many niggaz you know chill on the block with they fam and
Tell you if you need something handled, go and holla at Nick Cannon
Still spitting like I'm trying to get the deal
Don't fly private all the time, but I fly private with Shaquille

[Chorus]

[Childish Gambino]
Same old haters, niggaz just don't give a fuck
Tired of that old shit, swag is on some Bentley truck
Tired of these zeroes, ain't nobody near, though
Cause ain't nobody ready, throw the paper like confetti
Man, I get jobs, a hundred stack
Ya'll miss Jobs, like Wozniak
I make y'all insomniac?
No more sleeping, nigga
What you thinking, nigga?
I got your girl and need that E like we the Weeknd, nigga
People figure, cause I don't like it unless it's brand new
Everything is old news, even all your club clothes
Look like shit I wear when I need something from the Whole Foods
Royalty the newest niggaz fucking old dudes

[Chorus]</pre>
