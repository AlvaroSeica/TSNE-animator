Song:   If I Cry
Typed by: trickshady@hotmail.com

I can do whatever if I try
Can't let life pass me by
It's okay to say no
Wanna make it, then you gotta set goals

[Chorus: Romeo, Vercy, Intyana, Tata]
Can't let life pass me by
You can make it if you try
Hold your head up high
You might touch the sky
Can't let life pass me by
You can make it if you try
Hold your head up high
You might touch the sky

[Verse 1]
Look in the sky, you know where it came from
Plenty stars, but the moon, we only got one
Me and you, we all weak with shorty
We all human, so we people shorty
God made Adam, then he made Eve
Plenty apples fell from the tree
Can't forget about the birds and the bees
God's tears filled up the seas
And from my parents, came you and me
now you can be what you wanna be
It's time to make the right move (Uh huh)
You can be smart in school (Uh Huh)
All you gotta do is study shorty
Troublemakers ain't your buddy shorty
Stay focused, say no to drugs
Respect your elders by showing them love

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I could be a doctor, I could be the lawyer
I could be the next Michael Jordan or Vince Carter
I could be a teacher cause I love to read
I could be a fireman or the police
I wanna be a scientist and save the world
I could be a vetenarian and study squirrels
I could be the president, just need your vote
Too many kids dying, we just need your support
I could be like Master P and own my own business
A operator or a technician
I like airplanes, I could be a pilot
I wanna be it cause I will go to college
I could be on TV and be a superstar
or I could be a mechanic and fix cars
I could be an astronaut and fly to the moon
I'm always gonna be me, you be you

[Chorus]

(Vercy) + [Romeo]
Can't let life pass me by (Uh Huh)
I can make it if I try (Uh Huh)
But I gotta keep my head up high (Uh Huh)
and I might touch the sky (Uh Huh)
Can't let life pass me by (Uh Huh)
I can make it if I try (Uh Huh)
But I gotta keep my head up high (Uh Huh)
and I might touch the sky (Aight) </pre>
