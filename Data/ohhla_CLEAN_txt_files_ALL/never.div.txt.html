Song:   Never
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Shawty you never, never
Never had a nigga like me
Babygirl you never, never
Never had a nigga like me
Girl you never, (ever) never (ever)
Never ever ever had me (Uhh-uh)
Girl you know you've never

[Verse 1]
I never claim to be what I ain't
I never claimed and I never make mistakes
I never understood the reason why we hate (pshh)
Or why we never recognize when there's something great
So it's too late Shit I never catch a break
When cops drive behind me and they reading off my plates
Never toured around the globe never passed the states
Never got lucky laid on the first date
Never fronted on my friends before
Never done it what we kick it for?
It's 2 A.M. what we kissing for?
You never give it up, somebody get this whore
I've never been to jail never court to snitch
Never hustled rocks never snort no shit
Never rock Fubu polo sports my shit
I'm sorry Ed Hardy I don't sport your fits
Rather run with hundreds or some gorgeous kicks
Never laid the mates who were forced to skip
Never heard his spit well of course we sick
Never wanna see me on them courts too quick
Shit I'm balling like I'm AI tower like I'm 8-5
Call it what you want but just don't call it once it's game time
Never hear me talking lots of gossip through the great fun
Never stop until I take mine

[Chorus]
Shawty you never, never
Never had a nigga like me
Babygirl you never, never
Never had a nigga like me
Girl you never, (ever) never (ever)
Never ever ever had me (Uhh-uh)
Girl you know you've never

[Verse 2]
I ain't never been to prison
Never had a hustlers ambition
When I was in school I never listened
Never paid admission to a wack niggas show
And I would never pay attention to a wack niggas flow
No, never will I be ever put to rest
By another muthafucka that can breath the same breath as I
Never told my grandmother a lie
And if I ever did I could never look her in the eye
Never got a chance to say goodbye to my homie when he died
And I'm lying if I say I never cry
Never been a part of no trndy trash
And I ain't ever have to beg a chick to give me the ass
Never spit the rare scent on no findy bag
I don't ever pay for dinner with my stingy ass
Never been behind the wheel of a benzie-class
Till I wrote whiplash and I hope this lasts
Bet you never heard a nigga with a flow this brash
Straight A's when I never took notes in class

Shawty you never, never
Never had a nigga like me
Babygirl you never, never
Never had a nigga like me
Girl you never, (ever) never (ever)
Never ever ever had me (Uhh-uh)
Girl you know you've never</pre>
