[Omarion]
Second you caught my eye
Girl, I couldn't deny
That you got me on fire, baby..
(Something 'bout the way you walk)
I just can't get enough
Girl, you got that good stuff
I think I'm losing my mind..
Girl, can we just talk, baby?

In case you haven't noticed, your body's got me focused
just wanna let you know

[Omarion]
My name's Omarion, oh

[Chorus]
It's nice to meet ya,                          (EH!)
Baby girl, you're a keep-a,                  (You're a keepa!)
and I'm Never Gonna Let You Go,         (I ain't gonna let you go, baby)
Said I'm Never Gonna Let You Go
'Cause you're a keepa
You're something special
Feeling you since I met you,               (Can we do a lil' somethin', baby?)
and I'm Never Gonna Let You Go,         (WHOO!)
Said Never Gonna Let You Go
'Cause you're a keepa

Girl, it's OFFICIAL
Really, really wanna get with you
Girl, like no other..
(...girl that's in here tonight)
Let's go somewhere quiet
Get to know each other more private
Whatever it is about ya, just feels so right, baby

[background singers]
I like your conversation, just wanna take my time
and come over 'round you girl

[Omarion]
I gotta have you in my world, come here, baby!

[Chorus]
It's nice to meet ya
Baby girl you're a keepa,                (Said, you're a keepa)

Said I'm Never Gonna Let You Go,    (WHOOO!!)
'cause you're a keepa
You're something special,               (Oh, yes, you are, ba-baaay)
Feeling you since I met you
and I'm Never Gonna Let You Go
said I'm Never Gonna Let You Go,    ('CAUSE YOU'RE A KEEPA, BA-BY!)
'cause you're a keepa


Girl, I just can't get enough
Girl I just can't get enough
'cause you're a keepa
Girl, you got me burnin' up
and I just can't get enough
'cause you're a keepa
Girl, I just can't get enough
Girl I just can't get enough
'cause you're a keepa
Girl, you got me burnin' up
You got me burnin' up
'cause you're a keepa


[Big Boi]
The horns are making me horny
Sugar, darlin', I adore thee
These other girls are boring, really don't got nothing for me
Freaky in the worst way, me and Rick James got the same birthday
Simply means I'll drill you from Thursday to Thursday
Seven days, one week, one hundred sixty eight hours
I got the power, to make you shout, but I'll knock yo' ass sour
Scream, scream, permanent on the team
Like a Bantu, or a duke, or a.. ("Just for me!")
No LIE, relax, lay down, you need a t-shirt
You can sleep in the bed with me, at the foot of the bed, with yo feet first
And I will twirk you, unless you in that purple
You the only good smoking, puffing better than purple, guurl
I hope you fertile, guuurl
So we can have a baby Boi or a baby guuurl
To Chuck E. Cheese and Disneywuuurld
I'm just saying you're a keepa
From the day Big Boi was born, till the day I see the Grim Reaper
I'm keepin' her, Ha ha!

[Chorus til fade]</pre>
