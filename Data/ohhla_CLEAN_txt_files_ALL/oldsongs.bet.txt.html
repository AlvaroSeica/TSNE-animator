[Chorus]
Old songs, old songs 
Old records, and old memories 
8 tracks, takin' it back 
to, them old songs, olllld strong songs  

[Verse One: Betty Wright]
When you're 35 or 40 
and you chillin wit yo' shawty 
Whatchu gon' listen to? Whatchu gon' listen to
if you ain't making nothin new?  
If ya wanna just sample
Well Im tellin you, ya gamble  
You ain't even writing one strong song  
You aint even writing nothing to hold on 
Late at night you wanna watch TV 
Lean back and play a lil' Stevie (Stevie) 
Play the music, play the music 
Then you'll know why I'm talkin 'bout the 

[Chorus] 

[Verse Two: Betty Wright]
When you get a little older  
and your nights get a little bit colder  
Whatcha gon' cuddle to? Whatcha gon' cuddle to? 
Well it must be misty blue 
Tell me what you got on yo' menu 
Serve it up, I know that it's in you 
Serve it up, serve it up 
Serve it up serve it up serve it up 
Listen to the music that made you 
Tune in to what yo' mama played ya 
Time to celebrate, time to create before, it's too late
Oh, go to your favorite place  (Go to your favorite place)
Speakers bumpin, bumpin that bass (Speakers bumpin that bass)
Slow dance and what do they play? 
Betty and Teddy all up in yo' face!

[Chorus]

[Rap verse: Betty Wright] 
I must admit yo' beats got fatter 
But add subject matter on subjects that matter... 
Cause it matters, yeah it matters...

[Outro: Betty Wright]
