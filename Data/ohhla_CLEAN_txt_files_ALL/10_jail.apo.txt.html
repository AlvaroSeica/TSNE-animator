[Intro: Apocalipps, (Chuck D sample)]
(One, Two, Three, Four, Five, Six, Seven, Eight, Nine)
It's the ten jail commandments
Get that package up, Buy some stamps too
All my niggas in Austin County, Word up
All them down state man, (Man fuck the legal age)
All yall bout to come up North, listen

[Apocalipps]
Cause I been in this jail for years, I ran with some animals
There's rules to this shit, I wrote me a manual
A step by step booklet for you to get
Your freedom back and not your date pushed back
Rule number one, You gotta keep some peeps by your side
If it's your Mother or your sister, Keep some fam by your side
Cause blood runs thicker then water, And that's a jewel
And if you fucked up in the town you better patch it up dude
Number two, You gotta utilize that time
Pick up a book and learn somethin, Interact with your mind
What you gonna teach your seeds when you get to the town
How to curse and smoke top until your fingers get brown
Number three, Everybody cool aint your mans
Separate your comrades from dick-riders and fans
Number four, I know yall heard this before
If your fuckin a guy, Then your ass gone die
Then you see it all the time you think a dude is thorough
Then you catch em in the yard with a nigga that's named Cheryl
Number five, Wear your helmet at all times
Niggas'll beat you in the head for days if you don't mind
Talkin bout how many spots he stuck, Hoes he fucked
He locked for beatin women, You prolly in wit a duck
Number six, That Goddamn tellin, Dead it
You think I'ma forgive you for snitchin, Shit forget it
Number seven, This rule is so underrated
Keep your mail and the next mans completely separated
Cause if you write my chick I aint tryna listen
I'm in the staul while you shittin, Ready to push your shit in
Number eight, Don't wait for your mans to pop off
Waitin for your mans, You'll fuckin get your head popped off
Yo if you wait for help in jail you must be retarted
Yo when the drama comes nigga just finish it where it started
Number nine, Get a fat girl by your side
When everybody bounce, Big drawers gone hold shit down
Cause she fat and ugly and don't nobody want her
That's why you gotta write them letters, Keep tellin her that you love her
Number ten, Your whole plan is to get out
Don't do nothin stupid and get maxed out
You can act like you gone die for that T.V.
But you'll be chillin in the S block, Bunkin with Anna Beasy
No doubt, Study this shit, Goddamnit
And rest in peace to Big, This is the 10 jail commandments
If you in Attica, Sing-Sing, or Clinton Annex
Then you can do time in any spot that's on this planet
Apocalipps, One love to my peeps in the pen
And my motto this time, Is to never return again, Word</pre>
