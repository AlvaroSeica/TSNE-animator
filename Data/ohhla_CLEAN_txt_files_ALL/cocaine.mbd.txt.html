Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Havoc]
Pay attention everything I mentions is a jewel
All I gotta do is whisper to make the fatty move
The constitution I go by, cash rules
Everything around me, the movementâs grass root
Started from the bottom bottom of the pyrex
Hand in hand until that money went high tech
Keep a legend in a Mac Book
The crystal ball too was watching the crack cook
Foreseen undisclosed amounts, Bentleyâs, Ferrariâs, overseas accounts, major assets
Forgot my address
Got so many of âem [?] And Iâm straight from the projects
Niggas got heart, but we donât got a conscience
But I got a complex, I donât ever wanna be a bum
So Iâm counting money till my fingers go numb

[Chorus]
Black, black, black, black, blak, black cocaine
Black, black, black, black, blak, black cocaine
Black black black, black, black, blak, black cocaine
Black, black, black, black, blak, black cocaine
Black black black, black, black, blak, black cocaine
Black, black, black, black, blak, black cocaine
Black black black, black, black, blak, black cocaine

[Prodigy]
Ask around whoâs laid up, sharp and straight up, Maffiosi
The most infamous dangerous rappers on the earth surface
I serve purpose, I donât bullshit with it when I spit it
Leave a burn like the alien blood in this age of Aquarius
Fear me not Iâm here to guide you through the various stages of changes and consciousness
High of the life and haze. Am I a hypocrite?
Chunky black with cat piss, call it Wiz Khalifa
Swinging trees like Tarzan and Latifah
Got me hide in sun, moon, stars and wheezy
All the hash smell, hoes in ya clothes be easy and close ya eyes while I rhyme these lines
These black cocaine lines
Now picture me in ya mind at the concert live
We well worth the ticket
A 120 minutes of ya favorite P lyrics
Yeah that dirty New York reality rap, that Mobb shit
Classic like Biggie, but we fresh like Minaj is
Now who you know got a flow so timeless, who write about more than just cars and diamonds?
Itâs more than just whatever new gunâs in style is
Prodigy the brainiac kid. Word to baby Jesus
This baby faced genius is lasted so far for 80 seasons
What makes you believe that I will stop now and allow Mobb Deep to collapse to the ground?
You crazy? I even make that thought get up? Wipe the dirt of and come again
This is not luck, This is hard work, dedication an passion
You just a flash in the pan
We endless and everlasting
Hey all

[Chorus (x2)]
Black, black, black, black, blak, black cocaine
Black, black, black, black, blak, black cocaine
Black black black, black, black, blak, black cocaine
Black, black, black, black, blak, black cocaine
Black black black, black, black, blak, black cocaine
Black, black, black, black, blak, black cocaine
Black black black, black, black, blak, black cocaine</pre>
