[Joe Mafia]
Is it really poppin', stop it, we on it like that, addressing
All drama, Mafia, crushing primadonnas
I'mma set it off for the hood, we scorching hot lava
On the ball, plus I'm off the wall, with two hot llamas
Got this every time, ready to get dirty, you heard me?
Lotta haters love to have my glow, but they ain't worthy
Ain't no mercy on 'em, so take it personal, we riding on 'em
Reimbursing the crime murder, these rap performers
Got a lot of nerve, word, expose curtains for that fake
Studio gangsta rep, I ain't never heard of
VA trace it back, to Old York, get popped, get cost on
Get caught up in the mix and you're hist, I miss courts of course
We got gang bangers, twisters and jigga hoes
My slang stay changing, connecting from coast to coast
We holding big toast, and max most, kid
This is for the sucker in you, anybody can get it

[Chorus: Joe Mafia]
For my gangstas (we ride) for my lifers (we ride)
For the hood (we ride, we ride, we ride)
For the youngins (we ride) for the hustlas (we ride)
For the struggle (we ride, we ride, we ride)
I'm on my J-O-B, staying sucka free
It ain't no games, it's gangsta, watch you gon' see
For them snitches (we ride) for them haters (we ride)
For this paper (we ride, we ride, we ride)

[Joe Mafia]
I ain't the average Joe, yo, it's the savage dough
Throwing talent to your Tahoe, checking Mavado
Fifty Don P, bottles and balo, we stay uptown clowning
Bouncing ounces in public housings, son, it's about this
Stack cheddar, rap whatever, I'mma relax, lay back
Type of fella, of course minds four pounds of echo
Go out and sell O, hello, I'm selling out swelling melon
Dirty throwback jersey, jeans is Hershey
P-E-A-C-E, be easy, wide body sporting an AC
I ain't new, so don't sneeze, please believe it
Greasy, I approach, silent Al Pachisi
Valors spinning in shadows, with white PC's
And ice tea, I don't care if you don't like me
Just like the fact your wifey will get piped by me
Dog I ain't handcuffing or stuffing, backwoods in birds
Like it ain't nothing, bust it, hate to love it

[Chorus]

[Joe Mafia]
My team flooding the scene, son, so what ya life like?
Top mission, top positons, son, keep my mics right
Stay fly, cradling cabbage, cutting the snakes rattles
Throwing hollows to swallow, for those who wanna tattle
Yeah, go 'head, I got, money tied in 58
Legit on my paper waste, fingers get levitated
Who put a price on ya head, don't underestimate it
Prayin' on my downfall, you hate it cuz I made it
I'm out the hood, it ain't all good now, what I gotta
Start smacking these rappers up and pull it Suge style
I got the hood behind me and it ain't hard to find me
Greatest of all time, prime Muhammed Ali cocky
I'm bout to do 'em, watch me, all out, it's Kamikaze
Hangtime from the bassline, posing for paparazzi
Gunning the twins of Gotti, keys of Pavarotti
Ivory, American me, he fly for Starsky

[Chorus]</pre>
