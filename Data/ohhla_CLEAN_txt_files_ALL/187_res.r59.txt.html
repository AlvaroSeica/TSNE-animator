[Intro] [Saigon interview on Ms. Drama TV]

[Ms. Drama]
So did you give OJ th-the lyrics to say in that particular song?

[Saigon]
For his song? No, he wrote his own lyrics. But...I'm not...

[Ms. Drama]
Did he give you lyrics to say?

[Saigon]
No, but at the same time it's like, and we just havin' fun with it
I'm not gonna, go, try to be super scientifical, lyrical, mira-
I'm not Slaught-I'm not a part of Slaughterhouse

[Ms. Drama]
So do you co-sign Slaughterhouse too?

[Saigon]
Oh, well, most of 'em. (haha)
Strictly I even co-sign Joe Budden like (okay)...
He's just a faggot. He's a fuckin' faggot
But...he can rap, knowhatI'msayin'? The rest of like...
Joell's my NIGGA. He not gonna just start something (So how...) 
He's not gonna just say, "Damn, I need attention.
So let me just pick on somebody for attention."

[Ms. Drama]
And they're very close though. 

[Saigon]
They are close. 

[Ms. Drama]
But ho-how do you think they all get each other's back? 

[Saigon]
I don't know. I don't know how they close
I-I couldn't be close with a nigga like that (That's all...) 
Yeah, I'm a fan of Joell (Okay)
I'm a fan of Crooked I and I'm a great fan of Royce
And you know...I think they can rap
But I just don't think these motherfuckers can make records youknowwhatI'msayin'?
I don't think there's one song on there that we gonna be singin' two years from now

[Sample] [Man talking]
From the say you're born...till the day you die
If you're one of the poor one's you just gotta work hard

[Verse One]
My shit is laid out
Fuck that beef shit, that shit is played out
Why is it harder for, peace over violence?
Niggas don't know The Art Of War, we roll in silence
It always got to be that one nigga that's the loudest
That ain't gon' do no poppin' when it's time to be about it
RAAAA RAAAA RAAAAAA  RAAAAA
Fuck outta here with that shit
You puttin' way too much passion into that wack shit
Put your dukes down nigga, we come in peace
With them AK-47's, we from the streets
Calm down, shhhh
You so emotional
I know where you're at in your career is such a low for you
I understand it
But understand this
My daddy taught me manners
So it's foreign to fly off the handle and talk to cameras
That shit is lame, lames we don't respect
We wonderin' why the fuck you so upset
We know the streets'll swallow you
Look what that powder do
Look at you try to embody what's not really inside of you
I promise you
That if you chill now
In 5 years I will not ride through the McDonald's drive thru and bother you
I'm here for fries
That's it
Chicken nuggets
Give me some sweet and sour sauce too and quit your buggin' {gun shot}
I'm just above it
I'm too mature for this
It ain't smart to go to war for this

[Chorus]
Cause I'm a rider
I'm about that 187
Cause I'm a rider
I'm about that 187
You not a rider
Not about that 187
You not a rider
{gun clocks} {shots}
187 [x8]

[Verse Two]
Got the illest flow because I flow it from my soul
You said yourself you got The Greatest Story Never Told
These niggas got the balls to say that I can't write no record
But them plaques on my wall say y'all should read the credit
R dot Montgomery, ghostwriter and for the right price
Y'all know the rest
Get your doe biters
Y'all goin' left
Get your emo in check
Later with them vendettas
Handle your liquor better
Let's play some tennis
Go back and forth, who winnin'?
You will give into a Koch deal away from (finished)
Fuck outta here with that
Step your bars up 
Your shit is garbage, what you tryin' to kick knowledge, be honest
Step your cars up
That little Benz you know is lame
I'd rather ride in a remote control Soulja Boy chain
I'm so insane
I flow with open flame
Note to self: leave him floatin' if he spoke your name
That's why I don't bother nobody
I catch a body all alone cause I don't ride with nobody
Niggas figure's been put on Jenny Craig
Look what the prison built
You big up top with skinny legs
C'mon Johnny Bravo
You fuckin' with the whole Detroit, chill out
The S.O.B.s without the swing, you needs to get out
I'm quick to stick the clip in 
Just ask my nigga Crooked
Joey Budden got you niggas trippin'

[Chorus]
Cause I'm a rider
I'm about that 187
Cause I'm a rider
I'm about that 187
You not a rider
Not about that 187
You not a rider
{gun clocks} {shots}
