[Werd]
I'm no a liar or a cheater I aint lying I will eat ya
Like a lion or a cheetah flying high like an eagle
And your small like a beetle not the Beatles just a beetle
And I hit it like smack like I'm dripping from a needle
I'm stripping egos you people your no lethal
Like me and Deeko people we evil you just feeble
On Myspace and Bebo like check out the Scottish
You all talk shit you get battered like cod fish
I Would rather hear Goth shit the whole Slipknot pish
Than hear another little fucking cunt record this
This is my whole life in the mic I got this
So listen to my mind but mind your not this
If you forgot this that Werd from the Burgh
Is utterly no other utter words so thurah
Thats Werd to your mother see I'm psycho mucka
Pure plug-in the mic I'm a psycho killer cunt

[Talking Heads]
Psycho killer Quest que cest
Fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa far better
Run run run run run run run away

[Werd]
Rewind mate you ken its
Walking pace but I'm running the track 
Top writer on the map top right of the map
Who want wanted in rap now I'm wanting it back
To have all the wee kids pure running it back
See I'm cutting no slack this is me at my finest
Forgetting who you are like a suffer Alzheimer's 
Plus when I rhyme this its minus kindness
As times goes by we get more divided
See Drew Devine is beyond you fuckers
This pen and the pad is my bread and butter
you've heard no other thats like Werd mucka
Whole life been pish through shit like a plumber
Its no joke see I'm past the breakdown
Used to love this but its all just hate now
I hate how you think you built a scene
I'm a psycho killer I kill your dream cunt

[Talking Heads]
Psycho killer Quest que cest
Fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa far better
Run run run run run run run away
Psycho killer Quest que cest
Fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa far better
Run run run run run run run away

You start a conversation you cant even finish it
You're talking a lot, but you're not saying anything
When I have nothing to say, my lips are sealed
Say something once, why say it again? 
Psycho killer Quest que cest
Fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa far better
Run run run run run run run away

[Werd]
Psycho killer stuck right here
They wont let me out</pre>
