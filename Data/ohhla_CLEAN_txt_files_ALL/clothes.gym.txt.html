[Chorus]
We have to take off those clothes
We have to party all night 
We have to take off those clothes
To have a good time

[Verse 1]
Excuse me miss
I couldn't help to notice how alone you are
I dig your attitude and how your actin how you own the bar
Got me flashin keys and I don't even own a car
Frontin like you ain't feelin my charm because I know you are
I'm trin see how your lips feel
Im sorry my names Travis and I'm pretty much a big deal
Oh, you never heard of me, hmmmm
That sounds absurd to me
The way you stole my attention is flat out burglary
What do you say we exit stage left so me and you could possible be
in a place  with naked peek-a-boo    cause
After all you blouse your wearing is kind of see through
And its obvious I'm battin where ever your leader needs too
Such an angel with a devilish angle and aquite the certified sweet talker
And your buying every line of it girl
And I don't even blame you
If I was in your shoes I'll probably do the same too

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Now here's another barn burner for all the slow learners
Put your helmet on and take a seat on the short bus
Next stop, right around the corner from your moma nem
No turning back so you better buckle up
Shit,  don't be concern with mine
I be like a speaker spell the way I got you learnin my lines fine
Pull the string replay that shit
I change my name to did he really just say that shit     Yeap
I take her by if you let me
6'5  200 pluss so sexy
My legs going numb for keepin my phone on viberate
Hide the fact your girlfriend keeps textin me
And I have trying to never mind it man
But every time I get a new number she finds it    Dam
And you thought you had it sewn up
Until right around            clock when I shown up

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
We got chicks
Its all hot chicks
Any block chicks and Hip Hop chicks
Thin chick round chicks
Black white yellow and brown chicks

[Verse 3]
Good grief girl your giving me goose bumps
Standin there in your underwear and new pumps
Its like the more time we waste the less time I get to tast you
Honestly I can easily replace you
Its not a scam girl
Its how I am girl
Peter Pan I'm a sucker for smuther jam girl
Its clear I'm only here for good clean fun
Shut up and kiss me like the inter lumps under my tongue

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
We got chicks
Its all hot chicks
Any block chicks and Hip Hop chicks
Thin chick round chicks
Black white yellow and brown chicks</pre>
