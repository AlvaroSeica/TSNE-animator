Typed by: AZ Lyrics

We can have a rendezvous
Butter on your crip legs, dinner for two
I know you're used to niggas running game
But I ain't playing games
Trying to introduce you to my last name
Let's get acquainted
Let me be your fiend, you be my nicotine
I'm about to take a hit, shit
Damn, start a fam
Take you to the crib, show you how I live
Need you by my side, you could be my rib
Your friends messy, baby, I could be your bib
Fool for your love, my pretty angel, you came from above
My little ghetto dove
Hold me down and I could take us up

[Chorus: Jhene Aiko]
You that nigga
You that nigga
Real go-getter
And I'm that bitch, so you better come get her
[2x]

She wonder where we're going next
Want a rider if you know what's best
I can be your iron knight and you I will protect
Inhale your love and let our souls connect
Go deep inside
Steal your heart, take away your pride
Can see it in your eyes
The way a gangster got you smiling took you by surprise
Got me smiling too
No waiter, girl, you are the menu
My number one fan, you are the venue
Fuck show money, rather you're my revenue
Smoke a blunt or two
Gaze at the stars, keep us hypnotized
Reach for the sky, I could take you to the top
I hope you do comply

[Chorus]

We can have a rendezvous
Butter on your crip legs, dinner for two
Later on, shit, let's see what it do
Been chasing you for a while, let's end the pursuit
Lock you down and throw away the key
My new life the only place for you to be
Glad you chose a G
I can be your dreams and fulfill your fantasy

[Chorus]</pre>
