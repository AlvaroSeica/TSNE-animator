[Chorus: Usher] + (Ester Dean)
I'm like whoa Kimosabe, yo' body is my hobby
We freakin this ain't cheatin as long as we tell nobody
Tell your girls you're leavin, I'll meet you in the lobby
I'm so cold, yeah you that hot tottie
(Oh-oh-ohhh-oh-oh, oh-ohhh-oh-oh)
Hot tottie (oh-ohhh-oh-oh, oh-ohhh-oh-oh)
Hot tottie (thought I'd never fall in love)
Ay (I thought I'd never fall in love, OOH!)

[Usher]
I see you like to talk, yeah, I hear ya baby
Claimin you a bad {bitch}, show me baby
I'm a wild boy, you tryin to tame me baby
To where I get it from the house, can you keep me faithful?
Got a lot of girls, got a lot of flavors
That's why when I hit 'em they on me to return the favor
Yeah I hear you what you sayin but hear me babe
Think you can whip it to the point where I'm screamin your name?
Said I'm tryin to get your clothes off
From what I'm seein you look so soft
It's your body what I'm goin off
Said you the rider, just don't fall off
Ohhhhhhhh-OHHHHHHH
Yeah I done had a lot of women that tell me what they can do 
but can you show me babe?
Oooooh, you got me like

[Chorus]

[Usher] + (Ester Dean)
Yeah, yeah, yo
I'm a choosy lover, I pick 'em out
Talk a lot of {shit} dawg, it's good as you puttin out
Yeah you fancy, huh? I'm tryin to pull you out
See it's a lot of girls standin rooooooooooound
She said (You claim you're the best!)
Ohh! (And I, only want the best!)
So I said ha, "I ain't gon' be here long"
Girl I'm tryin to get you home and get your clothes off
Skeet-skeet a couple off and then you doze off
You claimin it's better {wetter} if I take it off
Said you the rider, just don't fall off
Ohhhhhhhh-OHHHHHHH
Yeah I done had a lot of women that tell me what they can do 
but can you show me babe?
Oooooh, you got me like

[Chorus]

[Interlude: Usher]
I'm so cold, I'm so cold {*4X*}
And I need a hot tottie
Will you be my hot tottie?
She said she wanna make me better
She wanna make me better

{"Wait a minute mother..."}

[Jay-Z] + (Usher)
Call me King Hov, copy?
They call me King Hov, copy? Uh
They call me King Hov, copy, copy, copy?

They call me King Hov, copy? Big ballin is my hobby
So much so they think I'm down with the Illuminati
My watch do illuminate, my pockets are naughty
But I'm God-body, y'all better ask somebody
I was born a god, I made myself a king
which means I downgraded to a human being
You was born a goddess, I made you my queen
which means we upgraded to Louie the 13th (hot tottie)
Hot tottie, her body like Cognac
Her momma like herb tea, we burned a couple of sacks
And as the tea speak I creeped all in her teepee
We did it Indian style, had the girl speaking
in tongue, she like "Young, you hung, what you done done?
Stop it 'fore you wake up my mom, I might.." {*woman moans*}
And now that you arrived it's time that I go (yeah)
I'm so cold, I'm so cold, Hov! (ohh!)

[Chorus]
