Fortune and fame misfortune and pain
The less fortunate get blamed for the fraudulent games they playing
not a pot to piss in with your back against the wall
fuck a lottery ticket, I need to get it all
injected drugs in the poverty zones its logic
fuck watching gotta cop a V of my own
and cop a crib like MTV mansion and bitches dancing
hypnotize her with the necklace on my neck dangling
that's life son yeah word that's right son
till the day the white man come
and claim it all back, tell ya ass to fall back
where ya squad at? police squads waiting for you in the back now you sweating
back stepping better part of your life, you were acting reckless
for the first time of your life asking yourself questions
too late now to be nervous and now your nerves break down
hearing police cars swerving now, nigga lay down stay down
treated like a slave bound to a cellar and now they found cheddar
now or never was an hour ago, its foul yo, dreams of Alpo
was deaded in a millisecond, now you outro
old news, history like dinosaurs
kid you like the laughing stock of the town like Al Gore
bamboozled, even Sam Bowie thought he was first
before Jordan ran through em and, left em all hurt
I see, trifling whores all day, trying to work me
I beat it up, no love ma, your pussy's not worthy
superbly flow, dropping new philosophies
my mind stamina's Britannica, peep the glossary
5 chapters loyalty, next 5 bitches
5 for the politics, last 10 for riches
Page 36, trust no one when it comes to the money and riches
niggas act similar to bitches, shit is real
ya man'll stab you in the back for that
fuck around and get clap for that
just the hard facts that's why I stopped thinking with my cardiac
I think I'll drink a glass to that
Cognac in my veins shorty laying where the condom
slow up and down and now she moaning when I start pounding
when I'm in a zone like this you can start counting the money
flowing faster than Ferraris down in
Monte Carlo where broads getting fucked daily
some wanna get pissed in, but I ain't Chuck Daily
show me love baby, give me a hug girl
do what you do best ma, you know whats up girl
making a mean dollar, making em scream holla
my team solid got it locked yo, dont even bother
yall rich broke niggas with chains, cars that ain't yours
houses with walls that ain't yours, videos with broads that ain't yours
matter of fact perpetrate spitting with bunch of bars that ain't yours
lost divas, phony prophets, false leaders/
fuck that bullshit on TV ONE son I wanna fuck Alfredas
from the million dollar booths, to the coliseums
chicks beg to swallow this million dollar semen
slaying this, Bobbie Flaying this, cooking hot shit
took years to master, now I got your ears hostage
like Iraqi insurgents getting the point accross
up in the joint flossing, its like the Mafia in here
don't disappoint the bosses, I built the king's coffin
so he can lay in it niggas slaying in Prince George's
decipher the Davinci Code in a sec
the symbolism's old and Napoleon posing a threat
to all the foes and the fresh, the newcomers and the old vets
reporters, can't even put a face to the name
speculating on, where he came from, where he staying
this type of money can't be made just, from the music game
that's gasoline crude oil money I guess
still spitting rude boy grimy shit for ya set
page 59, be weary of the water that sleeps
fuck around smack you down and slaughter ya fleet
knock you off of ya feet, Napoleon my style's gory
to vanquish without danger's to triumph without glory
many tried before me and failed, the story's real
getting EuroDollars by the thousands, even before the deal
a verse from me's worth a quarter mil, even worse
for you its hurts when it makes a quarter of ya blood spill
Legend 4th quarter with the pill, crowd hushing
back spin, crossover with the rock swish at the buzzer
perfect execution Carnegie shit that sick shit
that Melissa can't afford not to listen
the hardcore listener song, call a mortician
Four four spitting album hit the stores and its on</pre>
