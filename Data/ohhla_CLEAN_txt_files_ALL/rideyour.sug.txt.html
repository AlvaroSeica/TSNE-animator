[Shug]
Awwwwwwww SHIT!
God damn, motherfucker I thought you knew
Don't fuck with my crew
Should I grab the punk motherfucker by his throat
Cut his head off, like a chicken, watch him croak
Should I just buck him, or should I put my dick in him
Should I let him suck it, well fuck it he got his bitch with him
Cause I'm that nigga that was down wit'cha brother
Ride me so close I could've used you for a rubber
Ride your own dick before I hit you with a brick
Make your mind up, be a man or a bitch
All that top dog shit to me is whack
Supposed to be a dog, but you purr like a cat
Stop all the whinin nigga, and co-signin nigga
Before yo' ass and the devil end up dinin nigga
All that small talk shit you better QUIT~!
You gossip like a bitch, ride your own dick

[Chorus]
Ride your own dick, nigga ride your own dick {*3X*}
Ride your own dick motherfucker!

[Shug]
I'm that brother that you dogged out fool
Cause when we first met, nigga we was cool
How much money do you make punk?
Do you make it as a manager or suckin chumps?
Cause when I see you, you're swingin on nuts
All the nuts you ride on, you can't help but suck
Now you wanna tell your boys nigga that you taught me
how to rap, stop lyin before I bust caps
First that young D nigga he was all that
But when you couldn't get paid, he was whack, save it
Tellin D's you could have 'em so fuckin large
So fuckin big, but you like fuckin kid
You got goofy, act a motherfuckin groupie
Save that shit, cause real niggaz know the scoop
Claimin that you're rich, top notch in the streets
But when it comes to eatin out you ask me to treat
So you made a few bucks from me, that's alright
But soon as you got it, you gave it to the pipe
You're the kind of brother that won't show up
When it ain't no money cause you don't give a fuck
But soon as a dollar bill hits a nigga pocket
Yo' ass come around fast as a rocket
Hand stuck out, talkin 'bout can you borrow
Sayin you got bills, that's due tomorrow
Knowin God damn well that you can't pay it back
Tryin to juice a nigga for his money, that's whack
If I was quicker I'd slap you like a bitch
Now the dog got his tail between his legs
Ride your own dick

[Chorus] - last two words changed to "PUNK MOTHERFUCKER!"

[Shug]
Stop jockin~!
I just hate when a brother stays down with me
Big group, hangin 'round to clown with me
But when I'm broke there's a change of behavior
I guess we weren't down cause now it's different flavors
But that's alright cause I don't follow no motherfucker
Like Native Souls I gotta move on up, brother
There was times I was sittin in the dark
Cause my electric bill wouldn't spark
But I'm the type of brother that would cuss and fuss
Thinkin of a way to make money 'til my head bust
So I picked up a pen and wrote a few lyrics
Cause at first them fools couldn't hear it
Now I'm the hardest motherfucker that you ever laid eyes on
And I ain't got no dick for you to ride on
Hooked up with some brothers that got faith
Cause at first we was takin up space
Got with Young D, and he laced the tracks
Now I guess he think I'm all that, right
First fools in Arizona couldn't see
Now all of a sudden they ain't blind no more, see
Got signed with a big-ass company
And motherfucker think the shit is only benefittin me
That's alright, I'ma still try to get rich
And ride my own dick

[Chorus] - change last words to "YOU PUNK ASS BITCH!"
