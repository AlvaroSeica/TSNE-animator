{M-M-M} Noooooo gaaaaames - WHOOOA - Future
Can't play no GAMES with these niggas - Rosay (HUH)
Noooooo gaaaaames - WHOOOOOOA...

[Chorus: Future]

[Rick Ross]
It's the takeover...
Kilo in the kitchen, pussy niggas - Merry Christmas
Bitches takin' pictures cause we keep on gettin' richer (WHOO)
Say a nigga name you know you fuckin' with them killers (HUH)
Walkin' through the club, only salute the real niggas
Ain't no bottles on your table, pussy boy go get your gwalla (HA!)
Hoes don't credit pussy so you can't pay her tomorrow (NO)
Bitch just bought a house she can't afford to run her mouth (WHOO)
I run all these fields, I run the game, not just the South (whoa)
Bow down to the biggest (whoa), Belaire I be spillin' (whoa)
Countin' all this paper, no games with these pussy niggas (HUH)
Double M, we poppin' (WHOO), shoppin' buying new clothes (WHOO)
Heard your shit keep floppin' (WHOO) and your crib got foreclosed

[Chorus]

[Rick Ross]
No games...
Can't play no games with these lames, I'm gettin' money like Tony
Three chains on my neck these bitches brushin' up on it
Hundred grand on my watch, you don't feel me then fuck 'em
If you playin' with work, we either feed 'em or touch 'em
I play no games with these hoes, get a ticket a show
Feds follow a nigga like it's a brick at the show (OHH)
VIP choppa (OHH), Rollie be matchin' (OHH)
Ho know we fuckin' (OHH), so don't even ask 'em (WHOOOO)
I play no games at the bar, all I see is Ciroc
Three bottles for Diddy, three hoes in the car
No love for these skeezers (NO), we party and fuck 'em (AH!)
Every day is a party (yeah) so every day we like fuck Â‘em

[Chorus]

[Rick Ross]
Mastermind...
Niggas sellin' dope just tryin' to come up in the game
Say it's for the fam but spendin' a hundred on the chain
Niggas go for self when they caught up in the fame
Run back to a nigga when them shots start to rain
BANG, BANG, BANG, BANG, BANG! Now we holdin' hands (HUH)
Success another gamble (WHOO), bitch I took a chance (WHOO)
Jumped straight off the porch (HUH), jumped right in the kitchen (HUH) 
Then I got a Porsche, my bitch wanted a Bentley

[Chorus] - last 1/2
