[Intro - Skillz - talking]
Woo!
Ha! 
Aw man
I like this
It's that feel good music
This one of them days man, you know
Everything right
The weather right
The swag is right
Haha, yeah, come on

[Chorus - Kornbread] (Skillz)
Fittin to have a little fun tonight (uh huh)
Ain't nobody pullin guns tonight (uh uh)
We might argue and we might fight
But it'll be alright, it'll be alright
Cause, the mood set, we enjoyin the light
Kick back, relax, we enjoyin the night
(Check one, check two, yeah it's me on the mic)
So it'll be alright, it'll be alright

[Verse 1 - Skillz]
Another day, another dollar, I'm just tryin to get by
Pull the curtains back and see a clear blue sky
What's the plans for today? I'm tryin to decide
Hit the car wash up, get a shine on the ride
See my man (see my man), in the cut (in the cut)
The barbershop, yeah, see what's up (sup)
See my nigga 'Bread ('Bread), see my nigga Slim (Slim)
The kicks real slick, plus they matchin the brim (uh)
The temperature's right, the air's so cool (cool)
Hit the crib up, pull out the old school (oh!)
Ain't heard nothin bad 'bout none of my good dudes
You know what they say, no news is good news
Turn up the sound (sounds), crankin up the beat (beat)
Some Earth, Wind &amp; Fire, some Teena Marie (come on)
I got my lean on, now I'm sinkin in the seats (yeah)
Just one of those days, I'm just breezin through the streets
Come on, let's ride

[Chorus] - w/ ad libs from Aaries

[Verse 2 - Skillz]
Hit the dice game up, a couple dudes might hate
Just left Miss Ruby's and got me a plate
Drove right past the cops, ain't make a mistake
Hit that left on Main and hit that right on 8th (uh huh)
Got a chick on Main, had a chick on 8th
They call and I don't answer, I don't want no mistakes
And this time right here (uh), the best time of the year (yeah)
You smell that? Somebody got a grill out (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Did a U-turn and changed my route
Tryin to find whoever that is cookin out 
It's a good day, nobody gettin into beef (uh)
I'm ridin slow watchin the kids in the street (uh)
Holler at the old heads, spend some time
That's how you do yours, this how I do mine
Hit the park up and watch everybody shine
And it don't get dark 'til a quarter to nine
Let's ride

[Chorus] - w/ ad libs from Aaries

[Break - Skillz] - w/ ad libs
It ain't a cloud in the sky, we sittin right in the sun (come on)
Keep doin what you doin cause we just begun (yeah)
And it's days like this, man they second to none (yeah)
So HAVE, HAVE, HAVE FUNNN!

It ain't a cloud in the sky, we sittin right in the sun
Keep doin what you doin cause we just begun
See it's days like this (ha), man they second to none
So HAVE, HAVE, HAVE FUNNN!

[Chorus] - 2X

[Outro - Skillz - talking behind the Chorus]
Woo!
That's what it is man
Huh, we get, it's that feel good music
It's that feel good music
Just one of them days
Uh, cookout right

Shorty actin right
You know, you've been there before</pre>
