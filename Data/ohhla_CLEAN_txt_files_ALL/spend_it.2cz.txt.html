Song:   Spend It
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I'm riding round I'm gettin it, I'm riding round I'm gettin it
I'm riding round I'm gettin it, it's mine I spend it

[Chorus]
I'm riding round I'm gettin it, I'm riding round I'm gettin it
I'm riding round I'm gettin it, it's mine I spend it
It's mine I spend it, it's mine I spend it
It's mine I spend it
I'm riding round I'm gettin it, it's mine I spend it
It's mine I spend it, it's mine I spend it
I'm riding round I'm gettin it

[Bridge]
I'm smoking on exotic my girl ain't got no stomach
Every time we have sex she always ask me for a hundred
I asked her if she workin, she asked me do I want it
I said when I went to school bitch money was the subject

[Chorus]
I'm riding round I'm gettin it, I'm riding round I'm gettin it
I'm riding round I'm gettin it, it's mine I spend it
I'm riding round I'm gettin it, I'm riding round I'm gettin it
I'm riding round I'm gettin it, it's mine I spend it
It's mine I spend it, it's mine I spend it
It's mine I spend it
I'm riding round I'm gettin it, it's mine I spend it
It's mine I spend it, it's mine I spend it
I'm riding round I'm gettin it

[Verse 1]
I'm riding round my side of town
Boxin gloves, I beat the trial
I had a coke, I had a smile
I had a coat for every style, crocodile the gator type
I'm allergic to the hater type, I'll take your wife, give her back
Nine months after that, similac
Similar to saying mama's baby's daddy maybe
When we had sex I was in the Mercedes
And I ain't crazy but if that's my baby
Then we gonna have to name the lil' baby Mercedes
The money that I'm makin I don't see it like I'm blind
I rather spend money baby I don't spend time
My pocket's on full and so is my gas tank
And all my cars got gas in the ash tray

[Chorus]
I'm riding round I'm gettin it, I'm riding round I'm gettin it
I'm riding round I'm gettin it, it's mine I spend it
I'm riding round I'm gettin it, I'm riding round I'm gettin it
I'm riding round I'm gettin it, it's mine I spend it
It's mine I spend it, it's mine I spend it
It's mine I spend it
I'm riding round I'm gettin it, it's mine I spend it
It's mine I spend it, it's mine I spend it
I'm riding round I'm gettin it

[Verse 2]
Photo-ready, my polo out the cleaners
I'm the perfect definition of something you've never seen
Maserati, Kawasaki, bought my girl a Beemer
The jewelry I got on is matching with the tequila
Patron margaritas, double for my diva's
I bring all my guns to work Gilbert Arenus
Plus I'm killin' features and I'm killin shows
I should have sex in a coffin 'cause I'm killin these hoes
Filling these goals, climbing up the ladder
Shoot your ass down you know I rep Atlanta, southside
I'm ridin around stuntin, smoking loud in public
Talking loud in public yeah my entourage is bucking

[Chorus]
I'm riding round I'm gettin it, I'm riding round I'm gettin it
I'm riding round I'm gettin it, it's mine I spend it
I'm riding round I'm gettin it, I'm riding round I'm gettin it
I'm riding round I'm gettin it, it's mine I spend it
It's mine I spend it, it's mine I spend it
It's mine I spend it
I'm riding round I'm gettin it, it's mine I spend it
It's mine I spend it, it's mine I spend it
I'm riding round I'm gettin it</pre>
