Song:   Tears in My Eyes
Typed by: Cno Evil

[Chorus: female singer]
Tears in my eyes, but I can't cry
Smoke in the air, but I ain't high
Blood on my hands, but it ain't mine
No second chance and die
I got tears in my eyes, but I can't cry
Smoke in the air, but I ain't high
Blood on my hands, but it ain't mine
I won't forgive or forget, let my soldier die

[La the Darkman]
Your mind travel after you killed the nigga
Like a hole in my stomach, tryin' to seal it with liquor
Waking up in cold sweats, hoping I be fine
Crying and laughing at the same time
It could of been me, but instead it was he
Didn't want him to come back, so I hit him with three
A first class ticket to the cemetary
The price of his life was just a small fee
I'm a real Killa Bee, my heart is ice cold
Froze, I put a tag on your toes
It's the principal of it, when I shoot a nigga in public
At first, I used to like it, now I'm starting to love it
This La...

[Chorus]

[La the Darkman]
I've been there before, full fledge, bloody war
I seen how them bullets rip through the passenger door
And pierce a man's liver, sharp, fast and vigor
Stood there for a second, just watched him shiver
Saw his whip coming, so I pulled out quicker
Took aim, started rapidly pulling that trigger
Squoze off, La never doze off, you clown ass niggas
I blow your nose off, the concrete jungle
Where I was raised to rumble, hard rocks get shot
All of a sudden they humble
I do 'em like that, with the knife or the gat
You can call me a snake, cuz I eat rats, muthafucka

[Chorus]</pre>
