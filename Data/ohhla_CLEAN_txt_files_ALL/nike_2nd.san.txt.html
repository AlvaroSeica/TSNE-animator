Song:   Nike Basketball Second Coming Commercial
Typed by: Immaqulate@gmail.com

They say a family that plays together, stays together
And one that falls apart just falls apart
So, together we stand, divided we fall
United we form Voltron and take on ball (lets move)
Yes, the birds left the nest
I'm all grown up, I gotta fly with the rest (un-huh)
Best of the best is what we strive to be
A legacy is what we trying to leave (ya dig)
Now say goodbye to the past
The future is here, at last (at last)
The second coming, the new beginning
The truth is speaking, you should listen (listen)
So glorious, victorious
We take what we want, we born warriors</pre>
