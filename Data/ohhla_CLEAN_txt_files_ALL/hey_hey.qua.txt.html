[Chorus]
Yeah yeah yeah (rich homie baby)
I heard dem roomer's like dem bullets they gone spread
and if my money short dem young niggas gone tear down on yo head
and I'm gone run it up and never do no business wit dem feds
I said the way I'm living feels great and I'm like

hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey [x3]
hey hey hey

[Rich Homie Quan]
See I'm a nice person, all the hoes speak to me
recognize that hoe in public, he got that bitch from me
he clam that hoe ain't thirsty, shitin me, l
I totally disagree, I won that game big history
ain't no commin over, don't interven
that kush burn her throat, listeren
and she clam she wanna roll, for energy
name a place and we can go, jus point you a sin
stop that beat I ain't playin wit her
money stuck to my pants pocket
keep a bank roll rubber band
I give a fuck how yo man talk
I was thought let these bands walk for me
took my hands off of it, and I lost control
and imma show you how awesome goes
we made it when they said it was impossible

[Chorus]

[J Money]
slide through the door and I crack the party
40 racks and I got it on me
circuit small nothing but rich homie
M.E.C. We the most wanted
she the Nat Nat lil Tony said I don't wanna fuck all I want is head
she the bud down but its slick file
run through the cool shall gangster party
ball so hard I pulled a spleen
trap house jumpin like trampoline
I hit a women cause I know they ain't even bout the money it ain't pertaining me
I'm the big dog hail head honcho
all about dem nachos
play around wit my Paso, my goons shootin like Rambo
lights gray, lights on, fuck nigga bad bitches on me
its Rich Homie and J Money, don't fuck wit fakes no lames up on it
man fuck apona they ain't seein me, street nigga to the death of me
I'm two time like 500 1000 wit it got to keep cheese

[Chorus]</pre>
