Ugh, ugh, ugh

[Rick Ross]
Sometimes I get so fuckin paranoid
Reminiscin on how them bricks keep goin back and forth
I ask the lord for everything I lack and more
Last thing on my mind was slammin Caddy doors
I just made up my mind, I'm grindin like a boss
Dedicated our lives, sacrifices we lost
Fatal mistakes, talkin laws of attraction
The paper I'm makin, I upgraded my fashion
Everything tailor made, floss is my passion
Loyalty came first, number one rule in the faction
Follow my actions, came in at oh-six
Planted my flag bitch I'm takin no shit
I toted them toolies, I bullied the bullies
I made a few hits, my bank account Jewish
You niggaz is minor, the money manure
I'm thinking like Heinman, Godfather the 4th
It was never filmed, therefore never seen
It was never him, that's what these haters scream
I wrote the script, I was sippin lean
Now meet the myth, I brought along my triple beam

[Chorus: Omarion]
This thing of ours
It's a mafioso
You ain't never know though
Never gon' know so
No never, no never, no never
No, no, no, no

[Wale]
This reefer the sweetest, got me thinkin much deeper
They don't rap for a reason, this is rather convenient
Spend money with my team, made my money from hustle
Women love you for free, niggaz hate you for nothin
Never hate you in public, but they let they eyes tell it
Ain't even 5'11", what the fuck you got scared of?
I'm a loose cannon, screws damaged
And I do think hip-hop music needs some newer standards
Hardest working conglomerate, and that's word to my momma
Getting up in they mental, get 'em outta they garments
Adamantly comin at whoever call up for drama
Just know that D.C., Philly, Ohio, Miami got us
Private jet over water, now Dietrich got no barber
I see feds, I go that way~! That DMV shit saw us
When you young and you black, they see you as a target
So before them foamposites get your lawyers in order

[Chorus]

[Nas]
The Don of all Dons, since you wanna call me somethin
All of a sudden, niggaz ball and stuntin, y'all just started pullin on
How riders pull your car, ya spineless
Where your heart? I know where mine is
A don is one who accept things he cannot change
Only thing I accept I cannot change is gettin old and dyin
Gold medallion, over my son chest
He'll hold it down when I sunset
What does death mean to me? I never owned the concept
I was here - I'm just a spirit, let's get one thing clear
Everything segues into each other
One thing is just an extension of the other
My kid to me, I am my children through history
Of stand up men and stand up women
I am existin I was conceived to break bread with kings, and make connections
We haven't met yet? My reputation you've stuck with
Until we have our formal introduction that's enough
But every male is not a man
So some of those that will hold out they hand won't understand, this thing of ours

[Chorus]
