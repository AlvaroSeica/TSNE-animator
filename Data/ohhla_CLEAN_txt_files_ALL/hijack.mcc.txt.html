[mc chris]
Call it a rebound of a hip-hop devout
Got my heat out, feel alright
like it is Friday night and pops says, "Yo, let's eat it out" 
That's what I be 'bout
On the mic is where I be now, indeed now
Good for you and easy to chew, like a big bowl of puppy chow
See how, I get up on the mic and I can excite
You may call it tripe, that's just spite
I know my shit's tight. psych, it's like
when I was just just a tyke on my trike
And all the big kids would flip lids on their BMX bikes
Go take a hike, and don't forget the trail mix bitch
Beats I know come from a Casio, so call me Chris
As in MC, envy, I be on the top of the list
You try to diss I won't resist
You'll feel the kiss of my fist, I never miss
You're gonna need a first aid kit
Remove your whack ass rhymes like it be a cancerous cyst
You can't deny your tight ass behind be so movin' to this
mc chris hold down his shit like he was holding bong hits

[Chorus: mc chris]
Like Mahatma Gandhi followed by a horde of hotties
or the feds on the trail of a Mr. John Gotti
I'm a sound wave tsunami, vocal origami
Hijack the mic and it's not like anyone can stop me

[mc chris]
It's like arithymatic, the way I make it stick
Some say it's gibberish, some say it's silly shit
But some people pay a cover charge to listen to it
Some people take the path train to Jersey for it
Ladies! In the corner with your hand on your hip
Make you jump so high that the record will skip
Make you feel so good that the room starts to spin
My favorite kinda nut is a macadamian
Come on all you honies, I am beggin to begin
I say I gotta get the get the grand, gotta get within
Gotta get more cream than Wisconsin
Honeyroom suite at the Sheraton
Bathtub full of expensive gin, lots of candles and violins
Bikinis made of diamond
Honies beggin me to break their hymens

[Chorus]</pre>
