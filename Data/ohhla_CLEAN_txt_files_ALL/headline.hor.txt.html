[Solo]
Y'know, it took me a while
I guess I kinda had to get used to it and readjust
But I think I'm starting to like it here

Rocking on blind faith with no MySpace affirmation
I do it the opposite of the highway
And I'll be happy just as long as I can say that
Causing ripples in the river with the playback
Like "Extra, extra, read all about it
Village idiot takes over the whole township"
Shit, I cut my own keys to the city
Me and A-diddy and whoever else wanna roll with me
I write my home brand of battle rap magic
If y'all can't dig 'em, then shit, well that's tragic
But don't think for a second I'd ever change the method
to fit your idiot box idea of what's impressive
We got you second-guessing, but the truth is
them new kids bringing the freshness to the set list
I stay super fly with or without the suit and tie
while these other mother-hustlers sit and scrutinise
I'm doing fine, thanks for asking
Move along now, best believe that it's on now
See all I need is a mic and a CD-R
I'ma remind these city folk what it's like to see the stars

[Chorus: 2X]
There's only so many hours in the day
But each one's a chance for each of us to have a mate
So you get yours and I'll mine
The headline reads clear, now we here to stay

{Repeat 2X}
I said no longer will I hide my lows, I hold my head up high
Cause I know now I'ma make it, take it one step at a time

[Solo]
Heart, mind and soul, the foundations of greatness
Found inside every track of the playlist
And I can see it in your faces
To say we touch base when I'm on stage would be an understatement
Hush baby, don't say shit
Let's make real music, throw it on, disconnect from the matrix
And you can say what you like
but calling me wack's one underestimation you do not want to make kid
See I'm a firm believer in speak softly and carry a big heart
and use it to believe in things
So I stay on the grind, chasing the limelight
Rocking prime time with my partners in crime
Cause I got dreams to be that emcee who writes something
to brighten someone's day, like so many have been to me
So please believe that piece by piece
we gonna put it all together till the people scream
We getting off scot-free due to lack of evidence
when we do a hit and run on your premises
See, my crew move like a shooting star
"And we put it in your ear, no matter who you are"

[Chorus: 4X]</pre>
