[Pretty Willie]
Yea I'm ready, let's do it
Baby, where you feelin go
That's where I'm goin to then, it's all good

[Chorus One]
I, I know whatchu thinkin bout
You, you prolly wanna go out
So go on and do whatchu do
I'm thinkin the same thing too

I, I know whatchu thinkin bout
You, you prolly wanna go out
So go on and do whatchu do
I'm thinkin the same thing, I'm thinkin the same thing

[Pretty Willie]
Come in on a late night
Somethin just ain't right
cause what do I see (I see)
My girl gettin dressed up
But she got me messed up, thought she stayin home with me (with me)
She say her and her friends goin out, bout to hit the club
Jeep pull up she was on her way (her way)
I kissed her on the cheek so sweet
Boo I love you, have a nice day

[Chorus Two]
It's a shame what a man might do when his girl is gone (ah yea)
First thing that we do is immediately pick up the phone (look)
Call up my partners sister
Tryin to see what's poppin (poppin)
(look) I just went shoppin (shoppin)
It ain't no stoppin
Cause I'ma playa (playa)
What can I saya (saya)
I'ma hit the streets with matchin suits and gators (yea)

[Chorus One]

[Pretty Willie]
So now I got my clothes on
Of course I got my fro's on
Hata's can't stop my shine (my shine)
And you know I ride that hummer thang
Suella don't maintain
Lookin for that girl of mine (of mine)
Pull up in V.I.P. see what's poppin
It ain't no stoppin til the panties droppin
And you know I'm with the frontline(frontline)
It ain't no stoppin (no,no,no,no,oh,oh,oh)

Dirty look, bro come on what we doin next?

[Chorus Two]

[Chorus One]

[Pretty Willie]
Flex, time to have sex with you instead
Look at you all pressed up and dressed
I'm thinkin girl like you do whatchu do and do your biz, boo
I do what I do boo, you know how it is
No 911's, no emergencies (emergencies)
Just bottles of Cris, friends, currency
Buy up the bar, you know how we are frontline (frontline)
So go on do whatchu do boo, cause I'm doin mine

[Chorus One]

{*phone rings*}
Pretty Willie, who dis?
  Where you at?
Where I'm at?
  Where you at?
I'm at home, ain't you comin home?
  Naw, I'm out with the frontline
What?
  Whatever
