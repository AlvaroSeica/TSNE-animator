[Intro - Lupe Fiasco - talking]
La-sers, yeah, yeah
(Kane is in the building nigga)
(Yeah! Let's go)

[Chorus - JR Get Money] - 2X - w/ ad libs
Alright, already the show goes on
All night, 'til the morning, we dream so long
Anybody ever wonder, when they would see the sun up
Just remember when it come up, the show goes on

[Verse 1 - Lupe Fiasco]
Have you ever had the feeling that you was bein had?
Dont that shit there make you mad?
They treat you like a slave
Put chains all on your soul and put whips up on your back
They be lyin through they teeth, hope you slip up off your path
I dont switch up, I just laugh
Put my kicks up on they desk (yeah)
Unaffected by they threats (threats)
Then get busy on they ass
See thats how that Chi-Town made me
Thats how my daddy raised me
Like glitterin may not be gold, dont let nobody play me
If you are my homeboy, you'll never have to pay me
Go on and put your hands up, when times is hard you stand up
L-U-P the man 'cause, a brand that the fans trust
So even if they ban us, theyll never slow my plans up

[Chorus] - w/ ad libs

[Verse 2 - Lupe Fiasco]
One in the air for the people that aint here
Two in the air for the father thats there
Three in the air for the kids in the ghetto
Four for the kids that dont wanna be there
None for the niggaz tryin to hold 'em back
Five in the air for the teacher not scared
To tell those kids that's livin in the ghetto
that the niggaz holdin back that the world is theirs
Yeah, yeah, the world is yours, I was once that little boy
Terrified of the world, now Im on a world tour
I will give up everythin, even start a World War
For these ghetto girls and boys, I'm rappin 'round the world for
Africa to New York, Haiti then I detour
Oakland out to Auckland, Gaza Strip to Detroit
Say hip-hop only destroy, tell 'em look at me boy
I hope your son dont have a gun and never be a D-boy

[Chorus] - w/ ad libs

[Verse 3 - Lupe Fiasco]
So no matter what you've been through, no matter what you into
No matter what you see, when you look outside your window
Brown grass or green grass, picket fence or barbed wire
Never ever put them down, you just lift your arms higher
Raise 'em 'til your arms tired, let 'em know you there
That you strugglin, survivin, that you gon' persevere
Yeah, aint nobody leavin, nobody goin home
Even if they turn the lights out, the show is goin on (alright!)

[Chorus] - w/ ad libs</pre>
