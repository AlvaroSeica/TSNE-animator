[Intro: Talib]
Aiyyo Fed, what's up bruh?
{"L-L-L-League of Starz"}
What's up with me? You know what's up with me man
Heh, I'm tryin to get +Paid in Full+
Check this out right
Since Javotti is the label, and I'm talkin over this def beat right here
I think we should turn it up
We got my man {"Tr-Tr-Trend on the beat"}

[Talib Kweli]
Thinkin of a master plan
Where there's nothin but cash inside my hand
Wanna dig into my pocket, my phophet is Heaven-sent
I dig deeper, you know I represent, represent
Yeah money over bitches, my sisters go over everything
My band'll make her dance, I'm forever just like a wedding ring
Far above the hate and the jealousy that the cheddar bring
Tryin to get away from there 85er's like Evelyn
Ride with me, I got 'em leakin like Nene
Got 'em +Leakin+ like Wiki, these monkeys bitin like hickeys
Cause they seein what I'm doin, fillin 'em with confusion
Cuttin just like a truant, I'm fluent just like a student
of the romance languages, only the diamonds hang with us
My meal is decorated with garnishes like your wages is
The crib is outrageous but really it's no joke
The girl of your dream be comin over to smoke - loud

[Chorus: Talib Kweli]
Turn it up loud, turn it up loud
Turn it up loud, turn it up loud
Drop it, stop it
With all the soap operas and the soapboxin
Turnt up...
Turnt up...
Turnt UP...
For the people

[Talib Kweli]
Yeah, you could feel the heat from the speaker, my sound'll darken your features
Run it down like a zebra, I move with the speed of cheetahs
I'm from Brooklyn where the heaters the size of a 2-liter
I ain't askin for no follows, I'm lookin for new leaders
It's hard not consumin all the bullshit they feed us
Intravenous like a cord to the womb from a fetus
Been hard since I started readin
Alliteration is literally littered through my DNA swimmin all through my semen
So every time I bust, babies begin bein born
Talk turns tough 'til them toasters that's tucked
get drawn like a picture, picture a perfect paintin
Police profilin people peacefully prayin
Lay the law like leaders, the lazy is lollygaggin
On my grind gettin gwap, guess green is the new black, yup
Meet me at the bar and we throwin a few back
Hopped out the car, you know who blew that - loud

[Chorus: Talib Kweli]
Turn it up loud, turn it up loud
Turn it up loud, turn it up loud
Drop it, stop it
With all the soap operas and the soapboxin
Turnt up - say it again
Turnt up - with a T, with a T
Turnt UP... woo!
For the people

[Talib Kweli]
Aiyyo we drink good, smoke good
These cats wearin funny hats like the Pope would
I come in lookin quite clean in the loafers
So hood I might scheme up to no good
You're no crook, Gosling in "The Notebook"
I got the birds on +The Wire+ like I know Wood
I still rep P.O.C.'s like I'm supposed ta
Comin live from +Death Row+ like I know Suge
My rhyme like a laser beam, so focused
I'm in the ring so lean I need a foam cup
I ain't lyin, bare teeth so ferocious
Well maybe I'm lyin bare feet in the ocean
On a beach fall asleep and I'm floatin
to the beat so unique like a potion
I love music, I'm complete in my devotion
(Word, say it again) I'm complete in my devotion
Turn it up

[Chorus: Talib Kweli]
Turn it up loud, turn it up loud
Turn it up loud, turn it up loud
Drop it, stop it
With all the soap operas and the soapboxin
Turnt up...
Turnt up - uh, uh
Turnt UP - word
For the people, P.O.C.

[Outro: Talib]
