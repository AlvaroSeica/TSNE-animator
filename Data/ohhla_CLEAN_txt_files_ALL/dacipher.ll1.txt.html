Yeah, whattup, whattup?
Yo, uhh, it's a man's world
Yo yo, it's a man's world
Yo, to all the boys and girls
It's a man's world, it's a man's world
Tell me, yo, feel that one time
Just feel me, feel that one time

Feel my surface, while you kick rhymes that's worthless
My rap verses, burn niggaz like black churches
Assholes, that sound off at live shows
Techniques weak, while I'm on beat like five-oh
Peep the rhyme flow, for all those that play me close
a double dose, biting my style, you catch strep throat
Can't cope, I see this bullshit happen
Niggaz be gettin deals cause they boy went platinum
I backslap em, destroy, all comp
Niggaz be kickin rhymes about shit they don't got

Now what you had in store buzz was looted, your music makes me sick
So I stay in bed and drink a lot of fluids
Hospitals for my stroke of genius, don't care where you come from
China or Venus, vagina or penis
Portfolio, four point oh, Scorpio
Had sex with the friends of my mom that saw me grow
The pitch was lead so you never caught up, you artificial
I need a teaspoon of sugar and two cups of water
And when you get the light you blow it, cause a lot of y'all
so confidant that when you wack, you don't even know it
Bogus poets

Chorus: Punch &amp; Words

Don't you hate in a cypher when your rhyme is through
And some wack rapper rhyme, right behind you
Messin up the whole cypher for the whole damn crew
Don't you feel the way that I do? "True!"
(repeat 2X alternating)

Let me set it, fashion MC's I leave naked
They get disrespected and burned on record
I rip mics, freaky like two dykes (what you do)
I kick rhymes, stay online like websites
The ordeal, I'm nice with rhyme skills
and rock on beats, that pump like high heels
I rip off, those that can't get they shit off
Jam like a Tec that don't spit off, I dead all
MC's, weak ones that try to tempt me
I bust off rhymes until I'm empty, don't sweat me

I'm ill, literate, you illetirate
Reap what you sew then knitted, in your imaginations figaments
Consider this, all size of words are sewn
Force a rapper to read between the lines like barcodes
You aren't known worldwide, hardly
You that same MC, that wore the nametage to the party
Be fly, prepare for departure, I'm raw
I frighten MC's like I had multiple sex partners
You write your Rest In Peace and tuck you in
That verse was the worst;
when you get some breath control then we'll punch you in

Chorus 2X</pre>
