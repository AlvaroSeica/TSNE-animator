[Intro - 2x]
Shorty bounce it for us, bounce it for us
Put your hands up playa, bounce it for us
Bounce it for us, put your hands up

[Hook - 2x]
Shorty won't you bounce that ass, get crunk and shake some'ing
All the playas in the club, want a lil' love
Shorty won't you bounce that ass, get crunk and shake some'ing
Playas if you feel me, let's see your hands up

[Dougie D]
Shorty bounce that ass for a nigga, wobble and shake it
Titties bounce and pussy popping, that's the way I take it
Girl you looking good, the way you move your hips baby from side to side
Jump up in the whip and ride, and we can smoke and sip to cloud nine
Playas all in the club wanna get a lil' love, baby girl that's fa sho
What the hell you done came here fo', we wanna see some g-strings and thongs
Bend that ass over like a tie m-hm-hm, bow leg with the fat cat
Now what a nigga think of that can I get a piece of that, can I hit the kitty-kitty from the back
So smooth and debinare, peeping all the diamonds in my piece oh you like that there
She like you on the wreck on your chest, and you owe me just as well
Throw it to the South throw it to the West throw it to the East, let me see what the pussy made for
And twerk it pop it shake it don't stop it, let Dougie D see what you got for me
Got mami open there, let me see you throw it like a heartbeat on my lap
Fill up the spaces pick up the pace, it drive me crazy when you do it like that
So you say you know how to work that thang, just what I came to see so don't play no games
It's Guerilla Maab 3D2 we made this hit for you, so baby girl won't you shake that thang

[Hook - 2x]

[Trae]
3D to the 2 we up in the do', and if you ain't trying to be down you got to go
It be one thang that I really know fa sho, I'm making everybody up in the club say whoa
Now I'm pimping the pen and I'm making 'em shake, hey shock and I rock from the left to right
Say girl don't front you better go get crunk, and make niggaz in the parking lot pop they trunk
And nine times out of ten a lot of hoes gon hate, but I'm a certified thug and it ain't gon wait
You better beat your feet and recognize the game, Guerilla Maab won't stop and we taking the fame
And it ain't no fun if I can't get none, baby girl we really gon do that thang
You better bounce to the flo' gon touch your toes, all a nigga really wanna see is g-strings
Better slow your role and mind up already, and you bout to make a nigga wanna take you home
We be deep down South and you know how we do it, working the mouthpiece and run right through it
I'm piece with a chain and looking oh so thoed, you see Trae and Dougie D is playa made for life
You better shake that ass and get down with us, and if you ain't know you better twerk it right

[Dougie D]
You got to give me what you got baby, no just what I need
If it's hungry baby I'll feed, ain't a need to act shy with me
Could you tell I'm a pimp by the way I walk, by the way I talk by the way I act
Love it when it goes da-da-da-da like that, let me get a pretty lil' brown thing to smack
What you tal'n bout whoo-whoo m-hm yes ma'am, ass thicker than a hundred cans of spray
A Guerilla Maab nigga that's what I am, and I want you to shake it when I hit it
Got it everywhere bounce that thang, let me see just everything your mama gave ya
We all in the club we all get crunk, so baby girl you got to shake some'ing
