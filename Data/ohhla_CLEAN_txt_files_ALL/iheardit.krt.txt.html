[Chorus]
I done heard it all before
Yeah you jamming, but your image needs some guidance
and some diamonds, cause it's more to this than rhyming
Yeah, I done heard it all before
We'll be traveling and flying state to state
Fucking hoes, rocking shows if you sign
Aye, I done heard it all before
Aye, in this game what you claim ain't a thang
Mississippi ain't for fame, change your name
Yeah, I done heard it all before
But your talent is by far a blessing and a gift from God
But we can turn you into a star
Aye, I done heard it all before

[Big K.R.I.T.]
Never losing it, pursuing it, my vision
In my kitchen writing rhymes, pray to God that they listen
But it's a real fucked up position that this rap shit might just put you in
My partner fed up with the game, like he might sell that kush again
Cause CDs, we been pushing them, but deals ain't coming fast enough
when he need to go feed his kids and this shit here ain't adding up
Passing us by, time never waste, busy home
Sit beside my grandma, wish that I can stay, the phone ringing
Promises so confident of money plays
I head back to the struggle like, they might sign me any day
Forever trapped, no coming back, addiction's truly hard to break
A thousand pills could never fill the gap of leaving off the stage

[Chorus]

[Big K.R.I.T.]
I pride myself on being righteous, do it big or do it bigger
But A&amp;Rs ain't in the streets, I'm forced to follow them on Twitter
I'm painting pictures, ghetto compositions, living work of art
But dancing in a circle dressed as Urkel how you make your mark
Aye, get your start, play your part, find your swag, get your deal
So you snapping? Who needs rapping when you got some ad-libs?
And some days there's no choice, most days it's hard times
If skinny jeans mean big dreams, no thanks, I'm just fine
In my mind it's bout rhyme, I'm just tryna speak freely
My shawty feel Illuminati's real and they might kill me
for voicing my opinion, scared to die, but this ain't living
In these meetings they can't tell me what I'm missing

[Chorus]</pre>
