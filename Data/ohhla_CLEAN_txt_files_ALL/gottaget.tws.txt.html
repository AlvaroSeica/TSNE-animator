[Twista] Category F5, Twista, Static

[Chorus: Static Major]
Yeah, gotta get me one, gotta get me one yeah
So I can creep up on her, so I can ease up on her
So I can get touchy-feely, put a dip in ya back
And give me one, slow jam (slow jam)
Yeah, gotta get me one, gotta get me one yeah
So I can creep up on her (creep up on her)
Everybody's tryin to get a little somethin
Can I get one, slow jam? (slow jam)
Yeah

[Twista]
When it come to ballin I do it with no hands
Left the Lamborghini home and took the Broug-ham
Damn, I think the club finna close, man
But I be the Twista, you know how I be doin it with the +Slow Jamz+
Take a look at the shawty chillin by the do', man
I'm really into her persona cause she don't be takin drama
But she thick, when I ask her where she get it
and she said she get it from her momma
So I think I'ma, pop champagne cause the glass tall
The bartender said it was the last call
I told her give it to me fast
So we can slow dance and I can put my hands on her ass (yes)
And she like it when I hold and grip, control them hips
And you know I like it when she get low and dip
Plenty swagger when she move slow and sip
When they cut the lights on you gon' roll with the Twist
Lookin so love-ly in the 'fit you got on
But it don't matter if you was in a dress or you in some jeans (nope)
Fragrance by a diva, purse from another county
Look at you girl, you're doin yo' thing
Everybody leavin with somebody 
and I gotta get with somebody so I'll be doin what I do
Gotta get me one too
Before the night go I'll tell the maestro that's yo' cue

[Chorus] w/ ad libs

[Interlude: Static Major]
I am on my way to the floor
Baby hold on to my shoulders
Girl I won't let you fall
Just hold onto my shoulders

[Twista]
She was lookin nice
Too hot for the cardigan, she'll melt the ice
Lil' mama kinda like Rihanna she was +Livin the Life+
She be givin advice, but just to have an orgasm she gotta get a device
What's that for? Is your man a boy?
Cause he don't know how to give you what you're here for
I think I gotta show you what the pilot gear for
And the question is what I whisper in your ear for
You nasty, love to be on top
Mad if I pop if you miss the drop
You nasty, how you made me choke you
Told me I can put it anywhere I want to
Sex so good she do it with no hands
I met you while the DJ was playin the slow jam
As soon as we got into an intimate slow dance
it's the beginning of when I was feelin the romance
Now I be Twista with the super tight flow
One might go that's so true (yeah)
I gotta get me one before the night go
I tell the maestro that's yo' cue

[Chorus] w/ ad libs

[Interlude]

[Static Major - repeat 2X]
What happened to the slow jams in the club?
The DJ's don't play them anymore
I used to meet the ladies on the floor
And wait for the DJ to play one</pre>
