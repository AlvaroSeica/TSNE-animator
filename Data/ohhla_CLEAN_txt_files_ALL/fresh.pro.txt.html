F-r-e-s-h
Fresh, fresh, fresh
Yo, that's fresh

Well I was walkin to a jam and to my surprise
I saw a lovely light-skinned lady with light brown eyes
So I told her I was lookin for the girl of my dreams
And if I didn't find her soon I was gonna scream
Then she looked me in the eyes with a grin on her face
She said, "I think this is the end of your wild goose chase
Let's go for a walk and find a place
Where we can do the right thing until you're blue in the face"
Cause I'm

F-r-e-s-h
Fresh, fresh, fresh
Yo, that's fresh

Now Mr. Bee has the cash money
And the gold rope chains with diamond rings
See, this man has a lot, three Rolls and a yacht
When it comes to g money he hasn't too much
No, luck is not the question or the answer
The brother's too nice, he's just a woman dazzler
Flashing hundreds over there and hundreds over here
When you see him with a lady using savoir-faire

F-r-e-s-h
Fresh, fresh, fresh
Yo, that's fresh

Well I admit there's a place for money and girls
But you need fresh gear to live in this world
Why just the other day I couldn't decide
On which Champs to wear and what Kleins of mine
So with anger on my face I walked out the door
I didn't wanna wear those, I went shopping for more
Lees and Sergios were everywhere
But I needed something new that I could wear
Cause I'm

F-r-e-s-h
Fresh, fresh, fresh
Yo, that's fresh

We're so fresh we don't have to rehearse
We can even rap to you in reverse
( *reversed vocals* )

Yo Jay, I saw you with this girl last night at the jam 
What happened, man?
Word she was looking fly, man
What's up with her?

Well I took her to the crib and started to rap
With the bass that I was throwin she was 'bout to be trapped
Then she said, "Hey lover, let's make that move
To the place to be for lovers so we can prove
That we were made for each other on personal needs
Let's get it started, lover boy, if you know what I mean"
Then we was in the bed together with the stereo on
Doing it to the sound of my favorite song
Cause I'm

F-r-e-s-h
Fresh, fresh, fresh
Yo, that's fresh

Now back to the man with class and razzamatazz
I'm walking down the street with all the ladies in a trance
When you see the brother's back, ooh, the man is ( ? )
To buy this and that, her gear ( ? )
Not only cash dollars but also checks
And when it comes to his status he is always correct
Relaxin in his mansion, wears thick money belts
While he's countin all his money he said to himself
I'm

F-r-e-s-h
Fresh, fresh, fresh
Yo, that's fresh

Sheeepskins and bombers up and down the block
Well time was runnin out as I looked at the clock
And then a girl walked up, she gave a wink
She said, "I bet that your girl could use a new mink"
I agreed with her, she then asked me what size
I said, "You'll do just fine" - I had her hypnotized
I then took her to my crib and with one last yell
I had her and the coat that she tried to sell
Cause I'm

F-r-e-s-h
Fresh, fresh, fresh
Yo, that's fresh

Fresh
That's fresh
