Don't ever hand me a dead mic, hand me a light and a Red Stripe
Before you end up Colombian neck tied
Run from your death get caught in the next life
Hit with a very heavy lead pipe. let's fight
Like low lives on a liquor binge, throwin' broken bottles at litter bins
Spittin in Tony Blair's face cos' I'm sick of him
I apply strict discipline, citizen Smif scribblin' liberation provocation
Start revolution, sellin' eighth's to an eighth of the population
Givin' them a proper education, a lot of fakes hate
wait stop concentrate on the reverberation
Word to the bass bin, lace bin Laden with his in a basin, shavin'
That's when you'll see me behavin'
You're ravin, now you're gettin' scraped off the pavin' like ha

War
Dope
Prostitution
Birth Control
War
Dope
Prostitution
Birth Control

Give me your heart and i'll rip it in half
Twistin' grass 'til each eye's like a miniature Mars
Start shit and i'll finish it fast
You're a little fish swimmin' with sharks
Old man you can't live in the past
I'll spit a billion brilliant bars and leave your head spinnin' with a
vision of stars and then
Fling a million darts
So militant I even leave innocent civilians scarred
I'm carniverous, chargrill idiots
Laugh last and laugh the loudest
Dark as the darkest cloud is
Loomin' over boarded house
you'da never stepped out if you'd thought about it (no doubt)
Your outlook's bleak as the weather cast
when the storm starts, I'm on a warpath
Teeth chatter when I walk past, parts of glass shatter
I shape planets out of dark matter
The masked man I manoeuvre through Martian marsh land
Markin' my turf with a can of Carplan
Magnificent shit,on the mic way larger than life like silicon tits
It's the slick city script spittin' citizen Smif
Buil'in' a spliff, tanked up, Billy the fish</pre>
