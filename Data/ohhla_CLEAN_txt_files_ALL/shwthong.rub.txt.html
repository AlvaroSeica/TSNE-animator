[Rubbabandz]
Ay shorty, you looking real good in that thong
We can get a room, and, we can get it on
A one night stand, fuck til the break of dawn
Checkout time at 12, you don't have to go home
She wanna sip something, get a bottle of Patron
She like that drink cuz Usher said it in a song
By the time the bottle was gone, she was singing Marvin Gaye
Let's get it on, let's let's get it on, let's go

*instrumental*

[Rubbabandz]
I need a freak like Adina, ass like Trina
That love playing with balls like Venus and Serena
That bitch pussy dirty, I take her to the cleaners
And can't look nothing like Missy Misdemeanor
A gangsta bitch, walk with a switch
I got a fetish for a little waist, ass real thick
Pretty hands and feet, and ghetto ass beads
I hate proper hoes, too stuck up to speak
Bitch get ya nose out the air, with all that
Cake on your face and that fake horse hair</pre>
