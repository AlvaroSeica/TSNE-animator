[Chorus: Kalipssus &amp; Napezz] 
Why why Why Why
Dem try to take our life's
Why don't yall let us live
If some day we got to be free 
well again yeh!
Seh dem are taking what is mine
contructed whit my hands
but I know that what goes by 
comes by yaw yaw 
Seh dem are taking what is mine
contructed whit my hands
and if dem take me out right now
somebody will take dem out

[Verse 1: Migthy Kalipssus]
Many Babylon forces
wanna fight me (ey yeh)
but I fight back ATTACK
real skill me have for dem
wanna try me come get me
I'm alwayz ready to fight
I'll be the last man standing
Ina this wa-wa-war Yeh Yeh
Somebody told me something 
someday me just membah
when he said shit in life is unfear so
you better take care of yourself
watch out every step that you do ina the earth yaw yaw
and never thrust not even in your shadow
the world is full of pain 
not act like an stranger
bcuz many peoplez play the fools 
while dem a run from the troubles
so dem never face the truth
living in lies and dreams
what you think that comes first
me see so many broken smile's 
increasing in my way
poverty racism 
goverment ahead dem mental slavery
that's what Jah peoples are guettin'
do you think that's fear
do you think that's fear

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Migthy Kalipssus]
Bcuz Jah will bun down
the Rudebwoys dem yeh
Let dem fuckoff dem life's 
but for the judgement day
what dem have cultivated that's 
what dem will collect
you'll see dem runin'
from dem sin's ina the coil of death
(Ziggidy ya ya yaw)
watch out and listen well
to what I said cuz
peoples dem are thinkin'
dem touch the sky whit money
and what yall wanna show 
to the likke youths dem
nuff cars,nuff gyals
not love not respect! YAW

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Migthy Kalipssus]
some live in Fairy tales
fancy among reallity lookin'
for an easy way out from that mentallity
but you know you grow up  like that
It's in your blood it's in your mind
it's in the way that you express and talk
So better keep in mind every word that I told you
the judgement day soon come
and a smell of death is around you 
recognize your mistakes
recognize your failures
b'cuz we're humans muthaphuckas
we ain't perfects
we ain't perfects
And Jah knows it,knows it
