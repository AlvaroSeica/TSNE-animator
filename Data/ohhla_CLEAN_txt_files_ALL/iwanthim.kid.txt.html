Typed by: Cno Evil

[Intro: Robert De Niro as Al Capone in "The Untouchables"]
I want that son of a bitch dead, I want him dead!
I want him dead, I don't care
What am I alone in this world?
Did I ask you what you're tryin' to do?
Did I ask you what you're tryin' to do?
I want you to get this fuck where he breathes!
I want you to find this Nancy-boy...
I want him dead! I want his family, dead!
I want his house burnt to the ground!
I want to go in the middle of the night, I want to piss on his ashes!

[Chorus: G-Clef Da Mad Komposa]
I want him dead, Murder Incorporated enforcers connect
Inject lead into his soul, for respect
Who dat creepin' out the dark with the tech
Infamous, Goodfella and Blakspik
Aww shit, Soul Kid Klik is at it again
A fraction of the team, but it still seem like ten men
You comprehend when you spot the infrared
Perpetrators get got, nuff said, I want him dead!

[Goodfella Mike G.]
Yo, I want him dead, face down in manicotti
Laying in the street like Castellano and Bilotti
Shot point blank between the eyes like Sollozzo
Bombed in his car like "Gaspipe" Casso
I want the fuck, chopped up, and mutilated
Albert Anastasia style, Murder Incorporated
Like Fanucci, blow his brains out the back his fucking head
Understand? I want this muthafuckin' piece of shit dead!
Like "blaow" with the stogie still smoking like Galante
It's Vito Andolini and Carlito Brigante
A/K/A the Blakspik and the Ill Dago
Leaving suckers sleeping with the fishes like Fredo
But this'll be a job for Mr. Corleone Brown
The Infamous Mr. Savage, woodsman from the Boogie Down
You find the fuck and put that head to bed
Like Al said, "I want him dead, I want him dead", you hear me?

[Infamous Mr. Savage]
You want him dead, son, you got him
Get 'em, I'mma shot him, wet 'em
With the crossbow cocked, axe'll split him.
React to rhythm, treacherous thoughts of mutilism
Pound his body til it glisten with blood, and then we ditch him
Who want the friction? My team is giving lacerations
Only way the perpetrators get got Murder Incorporation
Soldier, you raised in street gorilla tactics
Edge weapon specialist, equipped with full metal jackets
Killa theatric, this is war, no time for practice
Making moves with my platoon, and it's on, don't get it backwards
Yo, you know my steez, lick shots from out the trees
Then hit the streets, with my army cap down, dressed in fatigues
The minor leaguers, they run they mouth and will continue to
But what they gonna do when I and I come for you and you
Your crew is through when you meet, the well bred
Infrared aimed straight at ya head, I want him dead!

[Interude: Infamous Mr. Savage (Blakspik)]
What's up, talk to me? (Aiyo, kid what's up, I just got out)
Yo, what's up Joakim, what's going down, yo?
Got Mike G. on the line right here (aiyo, check this out, peep it)

[Blakspik] (Infamous Mr. Savage)
Yo, what up, son, remember that kid, we used to run with?
(Yeah, curly hair, light skinned, yeah I remember him)
He got knocked, so the whole block, is hot
I told him Cop-N-Go, but the nigga move too slow
Words on the street, he's talking shit, try'nna trip
He had some dolphin in him, so you know he's gonna flip
So rally up the crew, I wanna hit him up tonight
I want his ass toast (You mean terminate on sight?)
He snitched about the lab, and all the shit we had
The nigga Joe, and Storm, and Mike G they got nabbed
They said he dropping dime (nah, kid, he's dropping dollars)
Working for the feds, try'nna get 'em all collars
I don't give a fuck about no witness protection
I want that little faggot in a lion pit with maggots
And if his crew talk shit and try to flip
I want they wigs pushed back like foreskins on dicks
So, when you see him, put his chump ass to rest
And put his head in a box, V.I.A. U-P-S

[Chorus]</pre>
