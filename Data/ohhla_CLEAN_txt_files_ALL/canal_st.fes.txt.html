Aiyo, how could you floss
When you know your chain came from the back of The Souce
Look what I brought
I cost about a lumpsum, fuck what you thought
And the bling I just put on the cross
I wear J's, but never put my foot on the court
Still switch up jewels like changing my kicks
See what I do, ill chain in my flicks
Jesus piece, I just added some new stones
Don't know how to act like I'm straight out the group home
Cuban Linx, stick it in pythons
Live on stage, is this mic on?
Nah I don't do gold teeth, fuck up my smile
See I get a hundred thou, for my Colgate smile
I don't shop in the flea markets, no way, pal
See my gwop come fast now, go pay pal
These wooly rocks, diamonds, where you get that from?
Canal Street jewelry, kid, that slum
Need to holla at my son, nigga, 631
2662, 063, yup
Remember I had a Jacob, colorful bands
Dudes make ladies think I'm a wonderful man
They judge a man by the size of his chain
Don't know, behind the bling, he disguising his pain
See I just brought two new rings, I ain't change
Cuz I was iced out since Fubu came
Respect like Guru name, I'm a Gangstarr
Your shit ill like doodoo stains
Second place, so I guess you a silver medalist
I was pedaling, to go and get some better shit
I'm veteran, purple haze medicine
Chain like a salad bowl, I'm just putting lettuce in
I got beef from my summer youth check
Cop me a chain, put green around my neck
You see me wit a brand new watch, like I ain't supposed to have
Shit, what ya'll expect me to flop?
Hope the clock on my techno, stop
I got gwop, so snaps on the petro, got
And blocks like Lego blocks, a Eggo's watch
I'm never letting go, letting it fly
See the Warriors, the chariots with wheels to roll
And Prezzy got a chain with a piece as a ferry boat
Two 4 bracelet, Coogie sweater colors
Dressing room like a movie set for Danny Glover</pre>
