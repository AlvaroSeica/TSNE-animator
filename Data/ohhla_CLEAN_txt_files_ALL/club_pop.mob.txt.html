(Verse 1, Master P)
Last car I bought had a missing roof
Last hoe I fucked it missing too
Nigga in the club, higher than Snoop
That's a bad bitch, you's a hater, let her through
Told her girlfriend drop it for me
You got work, then cop it for me
See the Mob in the bitch, nigga
And we don't fuck wit'chu snitch niggas
Hatin on us'll get'cha rat pack
Put a extra hole in ya snap back!
In the club, poppin bottles with some bad bitches
From the ghetto, but a nigga got mad riches

(Hook, Master P &amp; [E-40])

(Verse 2, Fat Trel)
Thirty poppin, you don't want no problem

New pack, run it back, run it like a option
No stoppin, I heard my old bitch watchin

[Alley Boy]
Aye, it's our first day but you know I'm fuckin tonight
On site, skin it down to some Louie shoes and she right
Lame shut up, that pussy gon' get you set up
Matter fact I got shooters outside the club, they don't let up

Hundred bands a piece on my arm and my neck, we just show stoppin

(Verse 3, E-40)
Everyday a new outfit
Driveway look like a dealership
So much jewelry that they think I'm a judge
We bout to slide to the club
I'm banked up, boy look at him
Fatty linked it, like ZZ Top beard
I rap now but I used to sell soft
We in the mothafucka sauce
Also showing off, standing on the couch
Muggin bitch niggas with our names in they mouth
It don't cost you a dime to stay up outta mine
Give you da thirty second checkin if you outta line

(Hook, Master P &amp; [E-40])
Yeah I got dope in the dope house [Dope house]
