[Bronze Nazareth]
One Day about 9am I woke up
By the sound of gunshots of some kid who got stuck
Screaming wild, so I slowly get up pull back my blind
And I ain't see shit except a note that was signed
So I reached out and got the note and all the shit said
is, "we took HipHop and he's almost dead"
Pack up my lyrics and beats to Kill Bill
And head towards a thousand high hats upon the hill
My map says. "Follow weak lyrics and simple beats"
They brainwashed the streets just to ride and not think
I can see the suspects 'cause they always flashing ones
Plus I heard Stagger Lee saying he was from the slums
With some bleached poco jeans on
And tied up in the chair was HipHop with white tees on
I quickly called 4th Disciple
Told him, "HipHop is dying, meet me with your iron rifle"
And tell Razah bring some Brimstone
Meet me in Ohio with a thousand tonnes of gemstones
Bring all your jewels and tools, we need professionals
Ringz lined up a tour to hit the decibels
I last saw HipHop in St Louis
Singing with Christina in a club with Lunatics
We stormed the club and didn't find HipHop
So we grabbed Nick Cannon and beat his fucking ass up
And asked him where was HipHop, he couldn't tell
And said he though he saw him last week on TRL
He said they give it up if a classic album was made
So we hit for his lab later that day
And when we arrived HipHop was still alive
But he needed respiration in order to survive
So we gave it our breath and you decide</pre>
