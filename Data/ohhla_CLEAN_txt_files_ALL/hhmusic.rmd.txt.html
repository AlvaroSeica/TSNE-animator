"Rap music, don't want the rap music" (repeats during intro)

[Intro: Remedy]
Hey all you hip-hoppers, beboppers, body-rockers
Yea.. this is the Remedy right here
The solution to your mothafuckin' ear
And this is the shit that I grew up on
A little hip-hop, wit a touch of rock and roll
Feel your soul, lose control, haha

[Remedy]
Way back in the days, nineteen-seventy-nine
Back back when, I wrote my first rhyme
The same year, came the Sugarhill Gang
But little did they know about the Shaolin slang
R&amp;B, disco, pop, country, jazz
Don't think hip-hop was ever just a fad
Soundscan and Billboard, look at the sale
While other music failed, hip-hop prevailed
Rap music was goin' platinum from the start
Me, Remedy, come straight from the heart
Seventy-nine, Kiss Army, eighty-three, Run-DMC
Eighty-six, KRS and Beasties
Rakim, G. Rap, the Biz and Daddy Kane
Nineteen-ninety-three, end up with Wu-Tang
Hip-Hop Music is never gonna die
Remedy, Wu-Tang, hip-hop survives

[Chorus 2X: Children of the World w/ sample]
"Rap music, don't want the rap music" (repeats all throughout chorus)
Hip-Hop Music, Hip-Hop Music, Hip-Hop Music
Hip-Hop Music will never die

[Remedy]
Twenty long years, many went and came
But let me tell you now how the industry's changed
Everybody wanna rock ice, everybody swear that they nice (Yup, yup)
Everybody wanna be somebody, nobody's nothin'
Everybody wants somethin', keep on frontin' (WHAT? WHAT? WHOA!)
Yo, there's no more love for the music, everyone abuse it
Politics and cash now rules it
Your A&amp;R's are wannabe rock and rap stars
Lost in enforcin' the spot that they are
All of y'all artists that have waited for the fame
A word of advice, yo this is not a game
Some cash in, now some cash out
And most don't know what they talkin' about
Ninety-nine I must have been I'm crazy
Thinkin' that I'd walk into his office on some old Slim Shady
Love and respect broke fast with the record
Not commercial enough for Russel Simmons
Now Hip-Hop Music is never gonna die
Remedy, Wu-Tang, hip-hop survives

[Chorus 2X]

[Outro: Remedy (Children of the World)]
"Rap music, don't want the rap music" (repeats to fade)
Listen.. never die
Pop music, never die
(Remedy, Remedy, Remedy, Remedy will never fight)
Yes he will
(Remedy, Remedy, Remedy, Remedy, we will survive)
Hip-hop.. never die.. never die.. never die
Never die.. never die.. survive </pre>
