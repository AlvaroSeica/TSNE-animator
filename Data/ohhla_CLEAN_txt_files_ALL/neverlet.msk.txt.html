Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Ms Krazie]
I never wanna lose the one I love
Baby hold me close
Never let me go
(Don't you ever let me go)

[Knightowl]
Don't you go baby - tell me that you love me
That I'm the one you need - that you be thinking of me
Without your love - my life doesn't mean a damn thing
Be my girl - take my hand - and then put on the ring
I gotta have you - tell me yes - I must confess
I never had a girl like you, - you're the very best
You've made a change - and I don't know how to thank you
But if I ask would you let me - Baby can I spank you
Take my hand - and let me give you lots of sweet kisses
You and I - tell me that I'm the one your heart misses
I love you baby hold me tight - we could make it work
You mean so much - and you're the girl I would never hurt

[Ms Krazie]
I never wanna lose the one I love
Baby hold me close
Never let me go
(Don't you ever let me go)
I never wanna see you cry again
Boy I'm heaven sent
Together till the end
Our love will last forever

[Ms Krazie]
I don't ever wanna let you go again
cause the last time it happened - my world came to an end
I couldn't sleep - I couldn't pull my thoughts away from you
who you with - all I wanted was to be with you
cause you're the only man that I have really loved
and it took that for me to realize what we had
but now you're posted by my side once again
and this time baby boy every little thing makes sense
I made mistakes last time that I corrected
The way you touch my body el amor resurrected
I wanna spend all of my life with you
Mi vida te quiero - Por siempre mi anelo eres tu

[Ms Krazie]
I never wanna lose the one I love
Baby hold me close
Never let me go
(Don't you ever let me go)
I never wanna see you cry again
Boy I'm heaven sent
Together till the end
Our love will last forever

[Knightowl]
Times be different - but the love I feel just keeps growing
You kept it real - not like them other bitches - fucking hoeing
But you baby with my life - I can trust you
I'ma love you - And forever I'ma lust you
I'll never doubt you - and I never need to ask about you
And all I know is that I just cant live without you

[Ms Krazie]
I never wanna lose the one I love
Baby hold me close
Never let me go
(Don't you ever let me go)
I never wanna see you cry again
Boy I'm heaven sent
Together till the end
Our love will last forever</pre>
