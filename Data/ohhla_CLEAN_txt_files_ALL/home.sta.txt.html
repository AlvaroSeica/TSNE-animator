[Intro: Talib Kweli]
Ok (Build it up!)
There's no place like home, there's no place like home, there's no place like home
Let's go! Is there a heart in the house tonight? Yeah! Stand up!
Yeah! I got a question
(La La La La La La La) Is there a heart in the house tonight?
(La La La La La, La La La La La) Yeah! Yeah!

[Verse One: Talib Kweli]
Good mornin, so glad I got a home to record in
These houses people grew up in disrupted they can't afford it
Had hope to stay in the family for the son and for the daughter
They makin you fork it over or force into foreclosure
When I'm tourin I got a bunk but it's more like a coffin
So the comfort of a home is important
Trust, alot more with investments of mortgages
They could put in on rims strut to the club and flossin
This is the american dream, house, wife, kids and a dog
Fight for 'em in the bitter divorce 
Nobody win in the situation everything considered a loss
I grab a lemonade and sit on the porch

[Chorus: Talib Kweli]
I write rhymes to the sounds of the birds chirpin, tellin our stories in the first person
There's no place like home, there's no place like home
Yeah! I write rhymes to the sounds of the birds chirpin, tellin our stories in the first person
There's no place like home, there's no place like home 

[Verse Two: Talib Kweli]
Yeah! This is dedicated to places I'm stayin at
My crib my lab my pad and wherever I lay my hat 
For some it's a box or a tunnel or underpass
It can be your beach for as long as the summer last
Home is what you make it the place where you find your start
Where you go when the block is hot as a sign your mind at heart
The heart is a house for love, and so we build it up
I use to feel kind of empty until we build it up
This here the living room, it's where we chill it's the biggest room
My cousins on the coach let me sit with you
Your kids playin in the yard they as big as you
Where your twin of course catch him in the kitchen with the food
Feelin good this is so essential
Watchin the game with my pops who taught me the fundamentals
So I'm swingin for the fences, not just tryin to trod on base
My homeruns bring me back to this home place

[Chorus: Talib Kweli]
I write rhymes to the sounds of the birds chirpin, tellin our stories in the first person
There's no place like home, there's no place like home
Yeah! I write rhymes to the sounds of the birds chirpin, tellin our stories in the first person
There's no place like home, there's no place like home 

[Outro: Talib Kweli]
Yeah! Is there a heart in the house tonight? Uh! Yeah! Stand up! Stand up!</pre>
