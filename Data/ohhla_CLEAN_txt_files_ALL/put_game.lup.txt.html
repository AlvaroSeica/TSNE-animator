Don't you know that I run this place
And I've begun this race
Must I rerun this pace?

I'm the reason it's become this way
And their love for it is the reason I have become this praised
They, love my darkness
I've made them heartless
And in return, they have become my martyrs
I've been in the poem of many a poet and I reside in the art of many a artist
Some of your smartest have tried to articulate my whole part in this
But their fruitless in their harvest
The drow grows from my footsteps
I'm the one that they follow
I am the one that they march with
Through the back alleys and the black markets
The oval offices, the crack houses and apartments
Through the mazes of the queens
The pages of the sages and the chambers of the kings
Through the veinses of the fiends
A paper chase pager, Yo I'm famous on the scene
One of the oldest most ancientest things
Speak every single language on the planet nya' mean
I am the American dream, the rape of Africa, the undying machine
The overpriced medicine, the murderous regime
The tough guy's front, and the one behind the scenes
I am the blood of this city; its gas, water and electricity
I'm it's gym and it's math and it's history
The gun shots in the class
And you can't pass if you missing G
I taught them better than that
I taught them aim for the head, and hope they never come back
I'm glad ya daddy's gone baby, hope he never comes back
I hope he's with you mother with my hustlas high in my trap
I hope you die in this trash; I can't help it
All I hear when you crying is laughs
I'm sure somebody find you tied in this bag
Behind the hospital, little baby crack addicts had
Then maybe you can grow up and be a stripper
A welfare receiving, prostituting gold digger
You can watch on TV how they should properly depict ya
The river shall flow with liquor, quench your thirst on my elixirs
I am the safe haven for the rebel run away, and the resistor
The trusted misleader, the number one defender
And from a throne of their bones, I rule
These fools are my fuel so I make them cool
Baptize 'em in the water out of Scarface pool
And feed em from the table that held the Corleone's Food
If you die tell em that you played my game
I hope your bullet holes become mouths that say my name
Cause I'm the {*gunshot*}</pre>
