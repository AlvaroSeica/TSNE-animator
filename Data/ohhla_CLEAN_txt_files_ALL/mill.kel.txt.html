[Intro: Andre 3000]
I said her from the city
So she got to be witty
I said him from the country
So him got to be funky, funky

[Verse 1: Andre 3000]
I'm a millionaire but I feel like a bum
I'm a millionaire but I feel like the only one
I, I, I, I woke up early this morning
I don't think y'all heard me
I woke up early this morning
I don't think y'all heard me
I woke up early this morning
I don't think, think y'all heard me
I woke up early this morning, but I still ain't seen the sun

[Chorus: Andre 3000] + (Kelis) - (Repeat 4X)
Oh oh Oh oh Oh oh

[Kelis] + (Anre 3000)
Papa I'm a millionaire, but Saks Fifth Ave. don't sell affection
(Saks Fifth Ave. don't sell affection)
Papa I'm a millionaire, but I ain't moving in the right direction
Something ain't right, I know

(Repeat 3X)
I ain't rich until he is rich and she is rich, then we is rich
(Repeat 1X)
I ain't rich until he is rich and she is rich, then we is rich, mmmm

[Verse 1: Andre 3000]
Where there is cheese there are rats
Where ever there are rats there are cats
Where ever there are cats there are dogs
If you got the dogs, you got bitches
Bitches always out to put their paws on your riches
If you got riches, you got glitches
If you got glitches in your life computer, turn it off
And then reboota, now you back on
Can't just put the cap on the old bottle once you pop it, that will spoil it
Go on and drink it and enjoy it

[Verse 2: Kelis]
What's a girl to do when she has dimes no time just play-yay-yay-yay
What's a girl to do instead of me it's you'll be true-woo-woo-woo
What's a girl to do in a world of greed but kneel and pray-yay-yay-yay
What's a girl to do when she's lost her long time friends that's lie-ie-ie-ie

[Outro: Andre 3000]
I, I'm feeling sad like a million bucks
I, I, I, I, I, I'm feeling sad like a million
I, I, I'm feeling sad like a million
Sad like a million
I, I, I, I, I, I'm feeling sad</pre>
