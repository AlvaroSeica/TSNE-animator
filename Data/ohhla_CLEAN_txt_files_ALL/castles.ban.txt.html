Song:   Castles in Brooklyn
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Got a castle in Brooklyn
Got a castle in Brooklyn
Got a castle, got a castle
And a bitch, that too
Got a castle in Brooklyn
Got a castle in Brooklyn
Got a castle in Brooklyn
That's where I dwell

[David Banner]
I got a bitch chipping dumpo, met her in the Gucci store
Slutty bunch of Felipes have Porsche, wild girl
Fasten your city ball, me? I like to hit and go
Her body looks so damn good, I bought a condom
Is Brooklyn man in the house, yeah I bought a house
And when this snow outside I mean the mouse
If you see me murder alone she down south
Tryin to get all the good while the white folks their lawn

[Bridge]
If I am in the south I'm out west and chillin in Brooklyn
If I am in the south I'm out west and chillin in Brooklyn
It's Brooklyn in the house, it's Brooklyn in the house
It's Brooklyn in the house

[Chorus]

[Maino]
I got a bad bitch from Fort Green
And dime out in real hook a girl from the style
And a queen that's from flat bush
Shout out to my Brooklyn bro's
And addicted to that Louis Vuitton
No one how to grind hit the mall with them credit cards
Diamonds in my automat, back the back the corner store
Bitch we let em fight before we fuck I swear to God Gucci
Rock a Louie scarf like a bandana
So I introduce the system to my nigga Banner
Never change, I got love for my down girls
That did it all for the heights on Groundsville
Fuck em all my Brooklyn chick with a clown still
Still rolling non-stop like it's down hill
Yeah nigga take my Brooklyn chick everywhere
Thorough bitch man, she adapting everywhere
Yeah she got a condo where the Metz play
Took me to junior's in the business for my birthday

[Chorus]

[David Banner]
I'm on the Bridge bitch my nigga
I'm in a Bentley that stop on four
Tim and Saint James pull out some ribbon
Then it's the best I'm a Prada chick, her name is Chanell
All close to Prada boy, all the shoes Chanel
Listen junio I got cheese plus cake
Flyin' on the interstate, always in and out of state
J about the Metz and I don't talk about Leno
The crib got a ball in the burroughs, not a rental

[Bridge] + [Chorus]</pre>
