Just Gotta Make It (alright)
Just Gotta Make It

ooo-hoooo

Just Gotta Make It (alright)
Just Gotta Make It

Just Gotta Make It (alright)
Just Gotta Make It

[Trey Songz - Verse One]
Shorty-eeee (Shorty-eeee), all I got is a dollar and a dream
Is ya gonna roll wit meeee? (roll wit meeee)
You see I've tried a "9 to 5", and it just don't fit meeee (fit meeee) (no way)
I can get us out the hood and have us living good
You feel me? (Oh, do feel me?)
But I ain't leaving here if you ain't wit me (if you ain't wit me)
'Cause, girl, a suit wit a smile that don't fit me (that don't fit me)
Taking a bus for some miles is gon' kill me (is gon' kill me) (oh no)
I'm tryin' to turn it around, slide this thing from the ground
Well as long as you're down I knoooow..

[Chorus w/ The Ebonys' sample]
Looking at you day after day, I know I -
Just Gotta Make It (alright) Just Gotta Make It (Just Gotta Make It)
Just to see that smile upon your face, I know I -
Just Gotta Make It (alright) I Just Gotta Make It
Everything I do, I do for you and we -
Just Gotta Make It (alright) We - Just Gotta Make It
To the top of the world, me and my girl we -
Just Gotta Make It (alright) Just Gotta Make It

Now, babyyyyy (babyyyy)
One day soon, you gon' walk outside (Yes you are!)
And see a Mercedeeeees (Mercedeeeees)
And I'm gon' give ya the keys and tell ya go shopping (shopping)
(And buy e'rything you want
and buy e'rything you need, make sure you get shit for me)
Then I can get us out the hood and have us living good
But first I gotta know, if you gonna roll
'Cause a suit wit a smile that don't fit me (that don't fit me, no)
Taking a bus for some miles is gon' kill me (it's sure gonna kill me)
I'm tryin' to turn it around (Hey!)
Slide this thing from the ground (HEY!!)
As long as IIIIIIIIIII know-ho-ho you gonna be there

[Trey Songz' last line overlaps chorus]
Looking at you day after day, I know I -
Just Gotta Make It (alright) Just Gotta Make It (I Gotta Make It)
Just to see that smile upon your face, I know I -
Just Gotta Make It (alright) I Just Gotta Make It (Gotta see that smile girl)
Everything I do, I do for you and we -
Just Gotta Make It (alright) We - Just Gotta Make It
To the top of the world, me and my girl we -
Just Gotta Make It (alright) Just Gotta Make It

[Twista]
Trey Songz, Twista - we put it down like this
Even if I gotta go and cop a thang
Get up early and go standing on the block, some how I -
(Just gotta make it) That's right
(Just gotta make it) Uh-huh
Even if I have to sit with the fellas
At the round table and come up on a plot, some how I - (oh no)
(Just gotta make it) Baby girl I -
(Just gotta make it) Uh-huh
I'm tellin' you the truth on the daily
There's nothin' I won't do for you baby
Havin' big dreams of me ridin' in the Bentley Continental
While me copin' you a cute lil' Mercedes
And I know I got the block hot
But until I make it happen for you baby I will not stop
I'ma drape you with diamonds and furs
Visions of your herb blowin' in the wind from a drop top
Like a ball-laaaa, like a true shot call-laaaa
The homey, Trey Songz, tippin' all day long if he have to-
makin' that money for the family
Can I get a wit-chaaaa, it's that nigga named Twis-taaaaaa
Come and take a lil' cruise with a G through the Chi-town streets
Cuz you feelin' me under inspiration whenever I'm..

[Chorus]

[Twista - Outro]
It's Trey Songz, and the homey Twista!
Oh, we gon' have to make it, chy'all
For my baby, 'cause we entrepreneurs
I know I ain't doin' this not shoutin'..
