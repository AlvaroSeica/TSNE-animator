[Long Axe]
When he came upon this scene
Saw the green of this American Dream
Like a machine, it was making people lead
From the fat pockets and the gat popage
Some people made it out, others seemed to get their back lockaged
But it's a process, though you never see it
You getting high but you feeling like you underneath it
And if you ever reach it, pull a little bit
For the kids eating cereal for dinner and shit
In the mailroom down for whatever
To that cutie in the front won't frown if you let her
She thinking how it balls down to the pleasures
And maybe I can work, she can buy that new leather

[Chorus x2: Long Axe]
It's like my money on my mind but I gotta put my money on
'Cause baby it's a broke world
My money don't give my baby love she just loving dough
'Cause it got you by the throat girl

[Long Axe]
Arrogant, elegant buying and selling it
Gotta get the paper but the trees is irrelevant
Needs be developing, bills be settling
Tummy don't care about me when you got a mouth to feed
And it's all about pumping that weed, get a J-O-B
Girl want a brother don't stay with Old E
Took her to a play called "Niggas Ain't Shit"
Take her ass home she ain't giving up shit
Then you remember that caf√© in the Sixth
Didn't say nothing, didn't have to prove shit
Don't mean to sound mad but he didn't do shit

[Chorus]

[Long Axe]
You strive harder but you still somebody's baby father
Your baby momma all she do is feed you baby drama
But then you say you're honoured, I'm with him everyday
Daddy working two jobs, Mommy lost a job today
Raegonomics put my wallet on and lay awake
Listen to the burning Bush, he ain't have shit to say
I mean I struggle, treat a Friday like a holiday
My money wearing Nikes 'cause they always tryna run away
Talking to my son, don't hold your breath
There's 'None Left'

[Chorus]</pre>
