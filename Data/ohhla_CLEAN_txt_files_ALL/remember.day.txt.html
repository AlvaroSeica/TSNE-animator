[Talking]
Hey, do you remember when Matt Hinkle started it all
Dayton family 1990, invested the first g's to ever let us hit the studio...
Fo'get it, let me just ask you these questions, check it...

Do you remember the clique was breaking you off back in December
Surrender, you rappers aint got no skills, you just pretenders
We heartless, we takin you out the game and that's regardless
Them partners, they fuckin' it up again and plus they fault us
Remember, the niggas that reppin the ave they drop them ???s
Or fold those, we spendin them dates instead of them mo mos
We tiptoes, do you remember the way that we ripped those, like .4-4's
We breakin it down so fuck you hoes
Do you remember Shoestring, but fuckin it up caught as the ???
Remember... you rappers be runnin your mouths, but you all beginners
Quit actin, you bitches been suckin my dick but now you packin and jackin
Fuckin around with us, you hoes subtractin
Remember when dope was whoopin yo ass from start to ending
Stop bending, we bustin you up again yo head we sending
Keep walkin, we done check yo nuts before but you still talkin and stalkin
Quit suckin up on my dick bitch, you aint ???
I said it, I'm chasin you up and out and down you headed, get leaded
Fuckin around with Dayton bitch I'll go get it
Remember the honkies that finish you off just like a fender
You tender, stickin you in yo neck cause our agenda, you leakin
robbin you for yo shit, you know we creepin, you peekin
Checkin us up and down cause we some heathens
Bootzilla, blastin on these bicthes, we some killas
From the Dorseys to the Millers...

[Chorus]
Do you remember when the days were short and the nights were long
Do you remember holdin' on even though your daddy was gone
Do you remember when mama was mama and daddy in one
(Do you remember) Time moves on, but it's too late for some

Now it begun in 1991, Dayton Family tape out
??? dropped that cap and saved a home for fools with no ???
I remember rappin under these streetlights when shit was cool
Or battle rappin in the hallways of a fellow middle school
It wasn't polite to do cocaine in public if you was cute and pretty
Once when my mind dropped and that shit stopped, fucked up the whole city
Do you remember the days and nights when you were broke and lonely
No money, everyone inside your household was hungry, ???
I remember my neighbor was telling me to watch my mouth
Our lights was out, we runnin extension cords from house to house
And fuck some cable, we had barely drug in a dining room table
Hella hot main-meals, chicken pot pies
Remember runnin with gang bangers and fuckin up tramp-ass-hoes
Mama I aint goin to school today wearin these same old clothes
Do you remember the look in her eye when she made you a meal
and you didn't eat it, and all them tears she shed
beside your bed over things that you needed
I still remember the way that I felt when I picked up a gun
I still remember the tears that I shed when my cousin was blasted with one
Do you remember the way that you felt when you walked out of prison
Or do you remember the pain that you felt
from them sendin you back for no reason
[*beat stops*]
I still remember the way that the ball bounce
insufficient bank accounts
Guns and triggas is all that counts
I'm robbin you bitches for different amounts
I'm losin myself and I can't be found
The niggas out now are still firing rounds
Stuck on the ground, my son's outta town
September eleventh has swallowed me now
[*beat returns*]

[Chorus X2]
Do you remember when the days were short and the nights were long
Do you remember holdin' on even though your daddy was gone
Do you remember when mama was mama and daddy in one
(Do you remember) Time moves on, but it's too late for some

Do you remember when niggas was sellin rocks on yo block
Do you remember weed and dopers whether you like us or not
Do you remember when back was breakin you off with the goods
Do you remember rollin the caravan with all of that wood
Do you remember...</pre>
