Whoa (4x)

[Ludacris]
The whole room full of candles lit
Strip down get ready for seduction
My body all over your body
Our body language is the only discussion
I see you blushin'
You can't hide the fact that I'mma blow yo mind
You done had a hard day, stressed out
Ready to get up off them feet and I'm so on time
Tick-tock go the clock, it's Ludacris
Lick-lick-lick all over yo BODY
Conjure on ice, you ain't gotta think twice
Get nice so that you can get NAUGHTY
My tongue is the life of the party
And I'mma dance all down yo spine
And you can scream and beg for mercy
But I won't stop til I make you mine

[Robin Thicke Verse 1]
Stressed out, uptight, over worked wow'd
Unleash what you got let's explore your naughty side
Follow me, where we're going we don't need no bread crumbs
Cant you see, baby
You're the only one
You are among the
Few (hard woman)?
Let me be your medicine.
Cuz I got one thing on my mind, I'll be your valentine
Spread your wings and baby fly away

[Chorus]
It's your body, we can love it you want to
Love if you want to, scream if you want to
Just let me love you lay right here, girl don't be scared of me
Give you sex therapy
Give you sex therapy
It's your body, we'll go hard if you want to
As hard as you want to, soft as you want to
Just let me love you lay right here, I'll be your fantasy
Give you sex therapy
Give you sex therapy

[Ludacris]
It's so therapeutic, how I do it
Get into it, you gots to
Hit the music, cuz you gon' lose it
From deep tissues, or shiatsu
Don't care if the neighbors watchin'
And I won't stop til the cops come knockin'
Make a wish list then I got gifts
When it's Ludacris, miss I'mma stuff yo stockin'
Give you any and everything you ever really wanted
Or imagined that you could have in a lifetime
I'll be your one and only lover and your one and only plumber
When you need me I'll be movin through your pipeline
Whether it's night time or the daylight
When it's the right time, what it taste like
Gimme a taste test and I'mma get you
Got the banana, now let me split you
Ha!

[Robin Thicke--Breakdown]
Whoa (4x)

Girl, it's your body we can do whatever you like (2x)
It's your body we can ride and rock and roll
Ride and rock and roll
Ride and rock, oh oh oh oh

[Chorus]
It's your body, we can love it you want to
Love if you want to, scream if you want to
Just let me love you lay right here, girl don't be scared of me
Give you sex therapy
Give you sex therapy
It's your body, we'll go hard if you want to
As hard as you want to, soft as you want to (it's your body baby)
Just let me love you lay right here, I'll be your fantasy
Give you sex therapy
Give you sex therapy

Shawty, Shawty it's your body we can do can do can do (sex therapy)
Shawty, Shawty it's your body we can do whatever you like
Just let me love you lay right here, girl don't be scared of me
Give you sex therapy
Give you sex therapy</pre>
