[Intro]
Yeah
Yeah
Come on (Hey)
PSC, Uh
(Y'all niggas) What (Y'all niggas)
What Pimp Squad shawty
(What you know about them)
What they know?
(You don't know about them)
They don't know, they don't know
(Now what you really know about them?)
(What it is) Yeen know about them
Them heavy chevys shawty
(Yeen know about them) heavy chevy shawty

[Verse 1]
Now how you tame a young baller
That rides Suburbans, Caprices and candy Impalas
Raspberry Monte Carlos that march like a rottweiler
Off the collar addicted to hustlin' and stacking mighty dollars
Ho holla, when you hear the chevy beating down the street
Beating so hard the Crissy wasting on my mink seats
To get them reupholstered gonna cost me ten G's
The same as the Chevy platinum emblem on my keys
With the diamond against the trim 
Young ass nigga with a Louis V brim
A sporty young shawty with Gucci shades dim
These hoes mistaking me for being they pimp
They say baby couldn't see you past them shiny rims
I'ma cool little daddy bitch I've never been a simp
If you choosing ho then you need to hop on then
And if you ain't bitch, then you need to ride with him
Cause I'm pimpin' in my

[Chorus (2x)]
Ridin' swervin' 
Ridin' swervin' 
Ridin' swervin' 
Ridin' swervin' 
Ridin' swervin' 

Yeah, we ridin' in them heavy Chevys, them heavy Chevys
On them D's and them Vogues
When we shinin' on them hoes
Yeah, we ridin' in them heavy Chevys, them heavy Chevys
Beatin' hard in the park when we rollin' wit the squad

[Verse 2]
Now you heard of me
You gone feel something hot to the 3rd degree
Coming down your streets in a black Caprice
With a fine ass freak in the passenger seat
Y'all fake niggas don't know the half of me
I spit pimp game automatically, don't be mad at me
Cause I'm finally coming up in the industry and the 4's sitting up on the triple d's
Bloodline, the underground celebrities, Mack Bone my partner keeping the beat
Heat it up like a cookout when the sun fall
Y'all nigga better look out or your rap career is over
I put a hook out like you at Apollo
Ride and swerving while my niggas follow 
Hoes wobbling and start slobbin' bobbin' on the dick til they swallow, AH

[Verse 3]
Speedometer broken, doors smokin'
Body dented, windows tinted
Bend it round the corner
Leaning, engine steaming, screaming demons
Spillin' liquor, yeah nigga
Blowin tall off the wall
Burning rubber leaving foul
Muthafucka how you ride
Choppin blades with triple golds
Stay away from Campbellton roads
Playa cause I'm riding old
It ain't no thang to take them vogues
Jack it up, strip it down
Have the freshest car in town
Pimpin cuz I'm bout my crown 
 
Hey shawty what's that knocking sound

[Chorus 2x]

[Verse 4]
T.I.P and P.S is fresher than new SS's
Triple doors and vogues shining like some treasure chests (bling)
I got a fetish
I ain't getting in it boy unless it's
Got them little blue boxes off in the headrestes

I bet it's wood in the dash
Duel in the ass
Get an Impala, holla
Watch me (skirrrt)
When I pass
I'm burning rubber in your yard
Diggin' up ya grass
Drag racin' 454
That's what make it fast

I hit the gas 
And I mash on it in a flash
Throw it in the gutter
Buy another if it crash
That's petty cash

I parlay all day in a Chevrolet 
Pearsjay wit a face bright as heavens day
I'm beatin fo' tens in the flo then
Hit the store then for some more Hen (Hey Dub)
Pull a hoe and four friends

Dubs still spinnin' with a gold grill in it
White leather guts
Wipe up what ya spill in it
Still trillin out here

[Chorus]</pre>
