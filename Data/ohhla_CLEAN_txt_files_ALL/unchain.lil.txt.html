 Cooooome, come to your brother (Thou shall not die) 
 Unnnnnn-chain me, sister (Thou shall not fear)
 Looooooove is with your brother (Thou shall not kill)"

[Lil B overlaps]
Yesssss~! Been a long time comin 
(Ain't never gon's top man, it's Lil B)
A lot of pain, a lot of triumph
Now I come to the point where I'm happy..
(Rawest rapper EVER goin..)

[Lil B]
You could break me out the strait jacket 
This hip-hop is just play action
I switch off and I keep smashin
I'm a legend, fuck the rap-off
They say I can't do my thang, I'ma build my own lane
You come in, you get ran over, but damn, he sober
I'm the God MC like Hova
But I'm on another level and my grind is over 
Put that heater on your back like you're sittin in Rovers
And he always prayed to God, I'm just bringing Him closer
Feel like I'm doin a bid and my mind in Angola
Leave me food, then I'm cool, they tried to get over
I stopped pickin up my phone, they won't get any closer
They watch my every step because I'm livin in motion
Seen it in the hood, I can't, feelings is open
They ask for my money, every other day 
like I'm askin for something
But when I had nothing, they was laughin...
They TOLD me that I'd never make it rappin
It brings tears to see I'm on top
but I told you that I'ma make it
14, I was livin like my life was the pavement
and I wanted to die, couldn't nobody save me
Now I save my own self and I'm on and I'm famous
And I deal with the haters
Ain't nobody gon' take away what I built
Fuck the death threats, small impostors
They really got the love but they just choosin that option
When I started to live better, they started to hate
I still got the same brain, that caught all them cases
I've still got the same eyes, that seen all the places
But I ain't never been fakin 
And, it's not a game, it's not the Trail Blazers
Throwin shots but we dyin, man the rap game
is the slave trade, no time for meditation
Turnin into robots, the devil is money
It's not even human, the people die for a piece of paper
It's so stupid, better when ya...
Man, just live how-EVER you do it (Live your life)
I guarantee, you see your life as a child
And make you who you are, just make sure that you smile
People are dyin every day, ma's look at me now
There was hatin, but I never stop, I wanted to drop 
but Based God, gave me strength advance
I gotta really go, this my chance, make history, man
Three back, I was feeling like "Damn!"...
...Shit! You know how I felt when I was washin my hands
Off that filth that was around, I'd never be down
On the streets, I'm gone, I never be around
Because the hood is a lie, man you better wake up 
before you're dead or surprised
I'm just tryin to save myself man
F'real, but they trapped in the middle
Don't wanna go to school because the teacher too simple
I just wanna know where I come from, to tell me
the truth, before I'm gone and desolve, man
It's connected to the woods, the wilderness is my home
The world say I'm bad because of my color
But they don't get the fact I said that I love ya (I love ya)
People give, the option to hustle
Just take it, and I swear to God if you're willin to struggle
And once you pass the bottom, you gon' get it to the top
It's a lot of hate up in the world, just make sure that you watch
