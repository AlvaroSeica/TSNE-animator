[Hook]
You know my kind

We grinding we chasing cheese

Money first and mother fuck them hoes

[Magic]

Full grown pit my nigga I bought that
Pull your hoe card to see where your nuts at

And bitchin ain't gonna make a nigga give you nathin

Hook 2x

[RJJ]
Nigga I am R-J-J-R
My pockets are full of paper
Everything you see here's mine
I'm a thug and I'm rich
you know my kind
always on a hunt lookin for a lil more dough
I can splurge with
money I can merge with
women I can flirt with
see if I can thug em
I got me a dime
All I wanna do is cut em
No convo
All I wanna do is cut em
Don't play with em never act like I love em
Only act like that nigga daddy raised
See I'm kinda cocky in my ways
But a nigga getting paid
And I'm probably in the back getting laid
With somebody's wife somebody's getting' played
I got my eyes on the prize
Mind on my money, got my money on my mind
Got my money on my mind nigga

[Hook] 2x

[B.G.]
Nigga know my type I be right on the block
I don't give a fuck if ya'll I got platinum records or not
I be thugin, keeping it real
Holdin it down
From the East to West Bank
Up to downtown
I'm a street nigga
And I keep that work
Keep that heat
Bitch nigga give me fifty feet
I've been bout uppin
Loadin, cocking and pullin
Poppin and pullin
I been representin Lousianna to the fullest
I've been ridin 20's
Getting money at 15
Dat there new to ya'll that shit throw back to me
I been ridin Benz's
Blingin and all that
If I'm not a Hot Boy then whataya call that
I'm a Vet
I ain't Labron James
Call me MJ
I'm a legend in the game
Respect my mind
Can't stop my shine
Real niggaz they know my kind

[Hook] 2x
