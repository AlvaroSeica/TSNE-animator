Typed by: Cno Evil

[Intro: Dark Knight]
Uh... uh-huh, uh-huh
Yeah, whoo

[Hook: Dark Knight]
You niggas need a foot in ya ass, yeah, for real though
Cut, shot, stabbed, get stomped out by steel toe
Bitch nigga, runnin' yo mouth, poppin' that shit
Blame us, run up on you, rusting your shit, what?

[Chorus: Sharecka]
Ya'll wanna be like us, walk like us
Talk like us, rip a tour like us
Fuck a hoe like us, do a show like us
Get the dough like us, try to shine like us

[Timbo King]
Yo, Royal Famous, cats hit the ghetto
Dope like Wilson Ave. and Palmetto
Catch me, ice on Timbs, banana yellow
Coughing that purple glaze from Startell'o
Street, to the point, my slang is unheard
I come through, deep in the night, A-Alike, eating a like
Cheers, drunk dick, fucked Britney Spears
Been doing this since four scores and seven years
Dirty mouth, down south nigga, switch gears
Crybaby bitch tears, one flip can buy six years
On investments, my breathe fresh mints, mints, mints
Yo, a dime is chump change, ten pennies to me
Only thing she can do, is just give me a G
Let me find out, ya'll niggas scared of my Fam
Scared of my voice, scared of my first week SoundScan
More fire burns, smoke catch a higher learn
I know alotta liars, let's buy our own firm
Germs fifty cents, buck off the Bucky Dent's
Street kings, gangsta shit, now who you gonna get?
You good from far, but far from good
Hip hop love a nigga, got it carved in wood
Fuck a bodyguard, my body is already guarded
It's the return of the block party, Jamaican walk
Now they red talk straight yardy, yardy

[Mikey Jarrett]
Ya know me ready for them
When me step here, and me hold a mic, and ride with dem
Make a guy, know, said me nah smile wit dem
When you walk through, take off ya Timberland
If a shotta ina problem, me murder dem
We had enuff, lean crossed, don't try it again
If ya can't bust, by now ya nah gon' win
If ya can't bust, by now ya nah gon' win
You not gon' win, you not gon' win, you not gon' win

[Dark Knight]
Bitch nigga, runnin' yo mouth, poppin' that shit
Blame us, run up on you, rusting your shit, what?

[Sharecka]
Yo, it's me they wanna be like, make my guns ending ya life
Ya'll baby, like Pedialite
Floss the best shit, even ya wife
Mad cuz we ain't, eatin' alike, I take it like a thief in the night
Go 'head, be the first one to get beat with a mic
Smashed with a turntable, all labels, prepare to meet death in yo face
It ain't my fault, niggas that you signed, ain't repping these days
Whole promotion get 'em over, found out the hard way, it ain't his range rover
Company owned, even his home, even his home
Can't believe, he in the cold, snackin' on a buttered roll
Bond is gold, in the wrong mind frame and soul
Wishin' he could find a hole and crawl in it
Got my hustle up, now, it's all business
The way I rhyme, some cats might get offended
Especially those that's off balanced
Kill you first, come to the funeral shooting, yo, fuck silence
R.I.P. to me, means Rest in Pussy
I'mma be here for a while, whose next to push me?

[Hook]

[Chorus 3X]

[Outro: Sharecka]
I said ya'll wanna be like us!</pre>
