"I'm 65 I'm not retirin'"

I don't care about you're tippy tappy typist
The happy hippies tryin' ta say that you're the hypest
Yeah you can spell but your soul is made of silicon
You got no skeleton, you're talkin on the telephone
That's why I'm off the hook, and I'm on stage with Moka Only
In style city, makin people smile pretty
Or else I'm at the race track with Prince Vince for instance
Been doin this thing since we were infants listen
I don't play, not with kiddies and card sharks
Naw, North American man, I like titties and car parts
And study star charts and cloud formations, meticulous
Religious, its rather ridiculous
Really though I'm playin xylophone on your sister's ribs
Pickin out Christmas decorations with Mr. Dibbs
Shootin pool with Kid Koala talkin bout our girlfriends
Rollin with the Molemen til the day the world ends
And why not, I gotta lotta love and some airmiles
One of the best hairstyles slash fashion combinations
And conversations with Greg Nice in Austin, Texas
I'm off the checklist, life on the road is often reckless
Startin the day off right with some Cap'N Crunch
Chomp, later on me and Swamp'll grab some lunch
Probably, walkin til my legs get wobbly
Don't put your hands in the air its not a robbery
Don't say ho unless you're wearin a toupee
I'm gettin together with the Stero on Tuesday
Shoppin for shoes, I can't stop the bleedin
Where's Top Speed when you need em huh?
I'm callin Jimmy Castor to get me past the recipes
The rest of these referees and rest in peace indefinitley
I'm desperately lookin for the perfect beat to break in half
My back is killin me, and I really need to take a bath
It makes me laugh, some of these kid tactics are drastic
Just ask Cut Chemist from Jurassic
Meanwhile, me and Slug are doin arts and crafts
Drawin charts and graphs with my friends from the Livin Legends
I'm out here with Styles of Beyond playin frisbee
Until we get dizzy then we go and get a freezie
Point is I'm easy goin, no need to hide for
But some folks really need to get outside more
You can't chop wood with an axe made of words
Its attack of the nerds 2001</pre>
