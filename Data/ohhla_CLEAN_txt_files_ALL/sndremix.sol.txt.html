Song:   Soundtrack of My Life (Remix)
Typed by: Cno Evil

[Chorus: Deemi]
No all star cast, no scripts, no budgets
In the soundtrack of my life
Just drugs and violence, sex and cryin'
In the soundtrack of my life
I'm like Halle in Monster's Ball, Jada in Set It Off
In the soundtrack of my life
No special effects, just rep my set
In the soundtrack of my life

[Solomon Childs]
I'm all alone in this cold world, day to day life
Criminals christen the moon light
Dreams of being rich, get schemes of being rich
And got screamed for showing bail, praying for Bobby and Whitney
Wanted my ways to glisten like Sidney Potier
Ther's a war going on outside
Against Sues and cookers, street hookers, no more defeated
Niggas is nerdy, watch my words soak dirty
Oh, when I was young, I was a very good boy
Must of listened to my father
Oh, and I know when I had no need for beef
And all these niggas is greed

[Chorus]

[Deemi]
See the job wasn't making it, sold weed I started hustling
I smoke more than I sold, got to get to the studio
And moms don't wanna babysit, she thinks I don't love my kids
Dropped out and got my GED
Because the pressure was too much for me
Up late cutting crack for his fiends
His allaby when feds questioned me
When I was young I was really good girl
Remember when I had no need for niggas and weed

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
