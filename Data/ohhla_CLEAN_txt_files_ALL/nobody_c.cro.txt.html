[Crooked I]
Ay, I got a question for you
When you see another human being who's bein treated worse than a disease
on his knees beggin please for egg and cheese
or anything to eat, do you see his test as a lesson for you?
Or do you move on, say fuck 'em, ignore 'em, can't do nothin for 'em?
If this is true, let me count your blessings for you
You could be fightin hunger
Not the Gandhi type hunger strike fightin for somethin right
I mean fightin the type of hunger a little girl in a third world
fights every day, 'til her stomach is nothin
but somethin that her spine is hidin under, only been alive five summers
Hunger pains, her heart beatin like some live drummers
It's beatin harder, then she drop, died, momma lost a daughter
cause they ain't have food and drinkin water
Goddamn, I shed a tear in the booth
Cause when I say it I'm simultaneously hearin the truth
But do you CARE?

[Chorus: Crooked I] + (Tena Jones)
(Caaaaaare) You out there?
(I care) Louder!
I need to know if you care
We dyin out here on the streets
Little kids, they got nothin to eat
But does anybody care?
(Are you therrrrrre?) You out there? (Who cares?)
(You need to see you in them out there) Louder! (to care)

[Crooked I]
Like "Zero Dark Thirty" we saw terror
Growin up in the hood, a small error
in judgement can make your parents become some pallbearers for NUTTIN!
They saw Eric and he gangbanged, but they can't aim
So them straight shots caught Sarah for NUTTIN! Do you care or what?
Get involved, get out of your chair, stand the fuck up
Do somethin, don't lie down and do nuttin
Five rounds hit him in his side now
Blood paints the streets of the Chi-Town since the newswoman
When is the truce comin? Violence hit a news summit
And the view from it allows us to see the youth plummet
Gotta be sad, colostomy bags, shots got teenagers rockin a new stomach!
And I ain't sayin that this rap was perfect
But I'm strapped with purpose, tryin to get past the surgeons
in that emergency room - but if I don't get past the casket service
Just write this shit on my tomb
Nobody care

[Chorus]

[Crooked I]
We dyin out here in the streets
Little kids, they got nothin to eat
But does anybody care?
Does anybody care?
I said - we dyin out here in the streets
Little kids, they got nothin to eat
But does anybody care?
Does anybody care? Uh
Put a lighter in the sky tonight
Put a lighter in the sky tonight (does anybody care?)
Put a lighter in the sky tonight
Hold a lighter up high tonight (but does anybody care?)
Put a lighter in the sky tonight
Put a lighter in the sky tonight (does anybody care?)
Put a lighter in the sky tonight
Hold a lighter up high tonight (does anybody care?)

[Tena Jones] + (Crooked I)
Oooh therrrrrre (you out there?)
To care (louder!)
Do you see you in them out there, to care (anybody care)
Are you therrrrrre? (You out there?) Who cares?
You need to see you in them out there (louder) to care

[Outro: Crooked I]
All praises due to God almighty
I'll give a damn if nobody else don't, aight?
