[Intro - Sample of "O Canada"]
(O Canada!  We stand on guard, for thee)
(O Canada!)
(O Canada!)
(O Canada!)
(O Canada!)

[Classified talking behind Intro]
I told this guy where I was from
He said "oh, Canada"
Kind of laughed it off, real funny, huh?
Yeah, uh, come on
One two, one two
Mic. check, one two, one two
Yeah

[Verse 1 - Classified]
Uh, yeah, from the land of the lost, Trans-Canada cross
Patriotic and I honor with my hand on my heart
From the greatest of lakes to the greenest of greens
To the rockiest mountains and everything in between
(Oh, oh), oh Canada, oh you no fan of us
'Cause our movies and TV shows are so amateur? (ha)
Yes we laugh it off, that don't really bother me
Look we ain't serious unless we really got to be
Humorous attitude like Kidz In The Hall
Or Jim Carrey, Mike Myers, hell we claimin 'em all
It's the great white north, home of the funniest actors (O Canada!)
The butt of the joke with an abundance of laughter
The red and white flag, keep it high, keep it visual
People say Canada and get stereotypical
Think we finish every sentence with "buddy" or "bye"
And if it ain't that, it's either "dude," "eh," or "guy"
Canadaka eh, yeah we considerate people
And smokin marijuana, we consider it legal
Still doin rap like the 1990's
But that's how we like it, off time20and grimy

[Chorus - Classified] ("O Canada!" - repeated in the background)
I know where I'm from and I told ya before
North of America, hard to ignore
Every time I go away I tell them for sure
I'm from Canada, oh-oh-oh Canada
Oh Canada, oh-oh-oh Canada
I'm from Canada, oh-oh-oh Canada

[Break] - 4X
When Class makes a sick beat, we call it a classic

[Verse 2 - Classified]
I've been around the globe and heard the confusion
Honestly a lot of y'all are ignorant and stupid
Yes, we have microwaves, TVs and cell phones
Unintelligent fuck, we invented the telephone
We made Yahtzee, the lightbulb, hockey
And bred the greatest players - Gretzky to Crosby
We all got at least one drinking buddy
And after one drink, all of us think we're funny (O Canada!)
Our national mascot's a damn beaver
Oh Canada, we love our beaver (O Canada!)
Home of Hells Angels and RCMP
Home of Gordon Lightfoot and SCTV
No doubt, the underground railroad
Georges St-Pierre, right here is where he call home
Our health care system, y'all know it's free
Keep our girls bangin with a full mouth of teeth
I won't even get into the music industry
They say hip hop is dead, nah it's up north with me
I could do this all day, it's a part of my routine
But supper's almost done and tonight - poutine!

[Chorus - Classified] ("O Canada!" - repeated in the background)
I know where I'm from and I told ya before
North of America, hard to ignore
Every time I go away I tell them for sure
I'm from Canada, oh-oh-oh Canada
(I'm from the east coast of Canada)
O-oh-oh Canada
(I'm from the east, east, east coast)
Yo-yo, no doubt
Yeah I'm from Canada, so sometimes words come out of my mouth like this
Get used to it!

(O Canada!  We stand on guard, for thee!)</pre>
