[Jensen Kirk {*Junior harmonizing*}]
Yeah
Jun
We got a hit, homie
My California girl
My California girl
Ha ha ha
My Cali girl
Hey

Chorus: Junior (Jensen Kirk in background)
California girl
Oooh, you got my heart (She got my heart, she, she got my heart)
You got my heart, girl (She got my heart, she, she got my heart)
California girl
Oooh, you got my heart
You got my heart and won't let it go

[Verse 1: Jensen Kirk]
Hey
Let me get you out them heels
You been dancing all night, I got a place to chill
I heard you like
Watchin' the TMZ
Get the camera, I'll put you on my T.V.
You in the land where dreams turn reality
We can hit Melrose with no salary
And I love how you wear them Lugz
When it's just
Right outside, no sign of floods
Yeah
And we back to the club
Flashing Lights like Kanye in the club
I see you movin' that thang
Get a little closer, can we link up
Take you to Cape Town, better link ya wrist up
Girl, you got me movin'
Too fast, for one night
She said, "I'm a Cali girl, that's our type"
Speed, and you can't slow down in this Cali life

Repeat Chorus

Hook: Junior (Jensen Kirk in background)
Won't let it go (Let it go, come on)
Won't let it go (Let it go, come on, let it go, come on)
Won't let it go (Let it go, come on, let it go, come on)
You got my heart and won't let it go (Go, go, go, go, go, go)

Repeat Hook

[Verse 2: Jensen Kirk {Jensen Kirk *slowed down*}]
I see you wearin' them bamboos
With your press-on nails, let me talk to you
Got your toes done up and your fingernails match
{T-t-toes done up and your fingernails match}
I'm askin'
Can you be my hood chick
With the Rolex chain and the Jordan kicks
Hey
Where my Latinas, baby
Oakland girls go dumb and get crazy
And I love my retro girls
Vintage chicks, we can buffalo exchange it
I love how them skin is fit
Expose your shape, making it look
Like you were shape
Do the Kelis, show me how a Milkshake
And Cali's [{*niggas*}] job is only to hate
So don't worry 'bout the he say, she say
Just let your hair down and do it the Cali way

Repeat Chorus

Repeat Hook Twice

Break:
(Jensen Kirk in background)
[Jensen] She got my heart, won't let it go
         You got my heart, don't let it go
         She got my heart, won't let it go
[Junior] You got my heart and won't let it go (Go, go, go, go)
[Jensen] She got my heart, won't let it go
         You got my heart, don't let it go
         She got my heart, won't let it go
