[Kirko Bangz]
I done came down, hold up...
I done came down, hold up, grip the grain, roll up
And your girlfriend want a nigga like me
Cause I ain't tryin to control her
She call me when she want a change, black diamond, my pinky ring
And she know you weak and we ain't the same
You hit the scene, I make the scene
I'm in her head like Maybelline, H-Town so I'm made for lean
I'm in her soul, I make her scream
I don't ride the toll, don't pay the change
I'm EZ tag like Peter Pan, she want a man, don't need a man
I'm flyin down your boulevard
She cookin dinner with your pans
Draped up, dripped out, yo' bitch know what I'm talkin 'bout
Pulls up, pull out, we get it poppin in the parkin lot
She like to do it with the lights on
Don't matter to me if it's dark or not
I'm G'd up, East up, fossil pants, I'm hard as rock

[Chorus]
Girl I know how much you really want somebody
Want somebody that don't really need you
Girl I know how much you really want somebody
Want somebody that ain't tryin to keep... you
heard what I said, that could put you to bed
That ain't tryin to love you baby, just fuck you instead
And don't tell 'em nothin baby, you know that I'm comin baby
Just hit up my phone whenever you need you some company
Got this drank in my cup; oh yeah, I got this drank in my cup
I got this drank in my cup (cup, cup) {BANGZ}

[Kirko Bangz]
I done came down, came up, slow pitch, change up
Same hood, same style, same drink, same cup
She call me when she wanna fuck, I never call she knows whassup
Same page, same book, different song, same hook
Everytime her nigga trippin, she on the phone with the same crook
And everytime I pull up, she hit me with that same look
Lips bitin, hips right, she left her man for that get right
I'm in the middle, like midnight, but only if you got that sit tight
Only if you got that wine fine, only if you got that sip type
Only if you got that mind bomb, only if you got that sip type
Eat that shit like wonton, jokin baby, I'm pimp tight
I'm used to bein that one and done but girl you got that get right

[Chorus]

[Outro]
H-Town, oh yeah
I got this drank in my cup
I got this drank in my cup
I came down, hold up, hold up, I said hold up, hold up
I done came down like hold up, hold up
Hold up, fuck, 'chea</pre>
