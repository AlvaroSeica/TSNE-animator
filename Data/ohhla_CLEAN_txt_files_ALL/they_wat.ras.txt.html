[Rasaq - talking]
Ghetto status
Color changin' click

[Yung Ro - talking]
Click clack, two in ya back
Gyea, it's yung ro here
And you listnin to my parter Rasaq on the block
Givin' it to ya ghetto status, gyea

[Hook- Rasaq]
Flashin' them jewelz
Or actin' a foo
No matter what ya do mayne, they watchin' (they watchin')
You rollin' on dubs, you pushin' them drugs
No matter what you do mayne, they watchin' (they watchin')

[Verse One- Rasaq]
I pull up on them thangs sittin' on lo pros
Rasaq on the block, tryna duck the po po's
Niggaz got plex, so I tuck the fo fo
Black buck it, cap tux are lo lo
Chain iced up, got my neck in below froze
Don't even blow dro, but I'm rappin' in slow mo
Relaxin' wit yo ho, mackin' wit no dough
You know how we do it, what's happenin fo fo
And that's achers homes, pimp ya good, take her home
And make her mone, then take her home
Late in the morn
leave her body tremblin' and shakin', wit some achin' bones
Gotta watch what you do, or it'll come back to you
Wit the feds watchin' you, they gon come back to you
When you on the block, I could cover ya tatoos
Thats a positive i.d., when they comin' to gat you
Eyes is always watchin', when you flash ya jewelz
You don't have a 2, nigga that's bad news
Last thing ya wanna do, is have ya back in a pool
Of blood, cuz some foolish thug, is comin' to gat you

[Hook- Rasaq]
If you flashin' them jewelz
Or actin' a foo
No matter what ya do mayne, they watchin' (they watchin')
You rollin' on dubs, or pushin' them drugs
No matter what you do mayne, they watchin' (they watchin')

Hey Rasaq on the block, listen up youngin'
Gyea

[Verse Two- Rasaq]
Watch how I'll flip a dolla into g's
I started off a rookie
where under the years, now my ears all on freeze
Paint job, look like water from all the seas
Flossin' the v, my bottom the knees, and calmest of breeze
I'm from the hood, where theres no palm trees
Just g's and hustlers, they hand palmin' the trees
Other hand palmed to the gat, ready to make you fall on ya back
Be aware, the karma comes back
If you kill a man, the harm will come back
Live by the gat, die by the gat I promise you that
And that's just f.y.I, but of course
Nobody can stop the dark course of death when it rides by
That's why I spend this cash, get this cash
Live life of today, tomorrow could be my last
Till my hearts forced to stop, I will force Rasaq
Maybe comin' up a gutter unorthadox
But that's how I live, I'm tryna get a porshe or box
Durable roc's, and of course a glock, but a border drop
Just in case, a little nigga like me, is forced to pop

Ya feel me?, they watchin' nigga</pre>
