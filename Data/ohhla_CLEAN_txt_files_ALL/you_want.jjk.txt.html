Typed by: TwstdFlava@aol.com

My girls, goin 'round talking 
They say that you've been watchin' me boy 
I know by the way you're talking 
That you're really tryin' to get to me boy 

Not anyone I'll just let in my heart 
You have to be hungry for me 
Girls may have been easy 
But you have to please me 
What makes you think that I can say this to you 
I know how bad you want this 

1 - If you want my future then 
    You better work it boy 
    No it won't come easy 
    I know you want this 
    By the time I'm through with you 
    You'll be begging me for more 

I know your whole story 
Because you're fine and, and you know it 
You think that you can have me 
Just listen closely, no it ain't so easy 
Every word you said I have heard before 

Girls may have been easy
But you have to please me 
One thing I've been told, nothing else compares 
To this loving body 

If you want my future then 
You better work it boy, no it won't come easy 
I know you want this 
By the time i'm through with you 
You'll be begging me for more, so you want my loving 
I know you want this 

Repeat 1
Repeat 1

[MC Lyte]
Ay yo, Janet, now I'm about to kick this
You want this, but do ya really think you can get this?
At first you dissed this, now you wanna kiss this
Tell 'em girls! [Too late, ya missed this]
Cuz we need a man that's real quick and clever
Ready at the drop of a dime to whatever
Not tryin' to front or fake or save face
Cuz I'm with that day any time, any place

[Janet]
You want this, don't you? 
You want this, say it 
You want this, you want this 
Can you handle this, well, come here then 

Early in the mornin', late in the evening 
Just about around midnight 
'Cause you know i'll do you right, baby 
What's my name baby, 'cause you gotta say my name baby 
Just a little bit louder now 
Just a little bit softer now, nice and easy </pre>
