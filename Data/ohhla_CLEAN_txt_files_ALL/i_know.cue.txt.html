[Chorus 2x]
I know you feel the same way to
And I know you feel the same as I do
So let's put all this bullshit aside
Spread them legs and let me inside

[Verse 1]
I'm cruising in a regal
With a desert eagle
I see this hyna jockin
Players know I'm stoppin'
I have to turn around
But first I look around, I
Have to watch my back
I don't know where this bitches boyfriends at
I pull up to her side and I tell her jump in
My rolas bumpin'
Notice something's on my mind
You're looking fine and you know it
You know your ass and titties look good
Because you show 'em, I wanna hold 'em
Kiss 'em and come and you can suck it
I love it when a bitch trips in front of me
Girl don't be frontin' me
Let me see how bad you are
Let me see how far you can take it down your throat
Try not to choke
You don't need to swallow
But suck me Â‘till I'm hallow
And then call me up tomorrow
Oh, I'm sorry! Did I take it too far?
If you don't wanna fuck, get the fuck up out my car

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I love the girls that flirt
Look at the little mini-skirt
That she's wearin'
I know she's lovin' it when I'm starin'
I got my eyes on her, her eyes on me
I guarantee later on we'll be fucking in between the sheets
I know you feel the same way to
Your boyfriend don't have to know what we do
As long as no finds out and goes out
And runs their mouth about me and you
We can do what we do
Whenever you want to
Call me on the phone
I'll show up alone
Ready to bone
Making you moan
I'll take off your clothes
And we're both getting ours
When we're bumpin my flows
Nobody knows like a big secret
And that's the way I wanna keep it
Just between me and you, you and me
Will know what we do
So stop acting like you don't want to
I know you want to

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
You know I'm not the type of guy
To sit around and watch you lie
Know that I'm the type of guy
I'll fuck you I ain't gon stick and die
I'll never waste no time
On a bitch that can't make up her mind
It's now or never so make your choice
I know you like my voice when you hear my tongue flip
Picture me doing it on your clit
Or picture me rubbing it with my dick
Any way you like I'll give it to you quick
Let me see your tits
Put your nipple to my lips
I'll kiss your whole body
When we're acting naughty
I love to see your body
On top of my body
Smoking on some yeska while we're drinking Bacardi
When your man gets you mad, call me up and we'll party
I know you feel the same way to
And I know you feel the same as I do
So let's put all this bullshit aside
Spread them legs and let me inside

[Chorus]

Ha-ha once again little Peter Cuete
Let's put all the bullshit aside mija
You got what I want
And I got what you want
So remember that
Put the bullshit aside
Let's get down to business
And I'm gone (echoes)</pre>
