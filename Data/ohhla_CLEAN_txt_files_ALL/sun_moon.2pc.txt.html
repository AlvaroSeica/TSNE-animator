[Chief Okena Littlehawk]
The sun.. and the moon

{*begins to speak in another language*}

Your ways are similar, to the raisin sun
Warm to me, but too strong for some 
The more you are needed, the brighter you shine
Watch them for too long, your brilliance will blind
The eyes of mortal men, threaten you with doom
They regret to see you, set, but it is time, for the moon</pre>
