Super electric, super electric sounds
Super electric, from the underground
Super electric sounds blasting to your ears

As we break it down to the nitty gritty groove
The bits and the pieces, the electric boogaloo
Yes we be rocking, saluting the old school
It never went away, just check out my moves

Super electric, super electric sounds
Super electric, from the underground
Super electric sounds blasting to your ears

We gre up on the sounds, our ghetto blaster was huge
We bombed the underground, all city and the rooves
With the baddest mixtapes, you earned the ultimate cool
Bam, D.S.T, Mantronix, Crash Crew

Super electric, super electric sounds
Super electric, from the underground
Super electric sounds blasting to your ears

All those classic breaks are still used today
DJ spin the wheel, cold rock the party
Hype it up and vibe it up, stop, hold it, play
Calling all the boogie freaks, to come right this way

Super electric, super electric sounds
Super electric, from the underground
Super electric sounds blasting to your ears</pre>
