[Vinnie Paz]
Ain't a God damn thing gon' change, I'm still the same Vinnie
I'm still the same fat muh'fucker, same guinea
A little bit more money, that's why I ain't skinny
Still the same block hugger, still the same city
I still got the same people that remain with me
That was drinking forties with me when they slain Biggie
And the same muh'fuckers felt the pain with me
When my stepfather died and they came with me
I ain't expect nuttin less from them, they chained to me
Spiritually, mentally, we the same really
We all was raised on different blocks in the same Philly
Still some stupid muh'fuckers sayin they cain't feel me
Actually they do feel me, they just ashamed really
that they ain't shinin like the kid, a bunch of lames really
Dirtbags trying to make the kid insane really
But Louis Dogs just impervious to pain really

[Chorus: Lawrence Arnell]
Every morning I rise up I open my eyes thinkin I'm the shit
I guarantee if you fuckin with me you gon' know who you fuckin with
I been this way since I came of age and I never did play them games
I'll be this way 'til the day I lay cause ain't a God damn thing gon' change

[Vinnie Paz]
It ain't anybody ever gonna hold me down
I'm one of the greatest ever homey I stole the crown
I'm too strong and fast, you ain't slowin me down
I'm gonna keep beatin your head, call me Homey the Clown
I hope that y'all are holdin close to your rosaries now
I think I got a couple snitches that's close to me now
If I was them I'd keep it movin be ghost from me now
And pray that they don't run into Vinnie socially now
It's always one muh'fucker trying to set you up
Dry snitch take somethin from you, wet you up
I was sleepin bein dumb trying to protect the fuck
He gettin buck fifty, slice him from his neck to gut
All in all ain't nuttin changed, still the same squad
Some are still hustlin, summers at the same job
Some is nine to five, some is on the graveyard
I'd rather have them on tour with me so I pray hard

[Chorus]

[Vinnie Paz]
I'm the truth muh'fucker not built to betray
With the philosophy that Rome wasn't built in a day
No matter how strong the body it wilts and decay
After it's hit by a shottie that's silver and grey
I'm a mess, bi-polar, I'm willin to say
that there ain't a woman that's livin that's willin to stay
Somebody please fix my head, I'm willin to pay
I'm too at ease with the dead and the killin okay?
Damn, I'm anti-social, I'd rather be home
And when I'm drunk Planet and Crypt carry me home
I don't have a happy ending just tragedy holmes
You better address me as mister or majesty holmes
I'm a messiah, I'm a liar, I have to be stoned
I'm a pariah, I retire, I have to be cloned
I have fire, I'm desire, this has to be known
I'm a survivor, a relier on tragedy's throne

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Thing gon' change...
Ain't a God damn thing gon' change (thing gon' change)
I'll be this way 'til the day I lay cause ain't a God damn thing gon' change
(Thing gon' change)</pre>
