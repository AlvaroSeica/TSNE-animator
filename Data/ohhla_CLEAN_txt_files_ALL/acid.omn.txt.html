[Rapper 1]
welcome to the bottoms
the bottles
the down under

[Omni]
I swig liquor
strong enough to make you shiver
the shit that eats your liver
make it hard to remember when
shots of adrenaline
change my mind state
militant
I like the feel of it
on stage feelin' it
mister maestro
I smoke the hydro
keep the lights low
I know survival
die hard
number one by far
I'm high roll
high power
still on the low
ya'll niggaz know
I keep my hair cut and shoes clean
I keep my jeans baggy
that's where I stash the scale and the sandwich baggies
play with the big boys
universal
big swish
we smoke big weed to big beats
ay dig this
what's up pluto
all my niggaz like to scramble
we throw back whiskey shots
stay up and gamble
it's nothing
I got 'em
roll the dice
shake 'em up
drop 'em
if they front break 'em off proper
we raid your city like gotham
it's the goons fuckin' up the hotel room
we do what we want
yeah know what
imagine that
we walk the map
look for the pack
and bring it back

[Ali Baba]
bring it back 'cause we never dare front
beloved omnipresent
until we in a convalescent
universal, pudge and crag
get used to us
radio, promo
they give juice to us
seen ya nigga in a magazine
??? cop the centerfold
blx
the biggest ad you see
little teens roll weed to it
and word of mouth certified as dope
that's how we do it
from ves park out to addalay
have you jumping like a saturday
down at the matinee
what more can I say
so get ready
that's four classic albums for funkdafied freddy
and like the omni abstract rude said
long awaited collaborations take place when facing west
grace and best wishes to my nigga on the australia mission

[Rapper 2]
???
ready to rhyme g
with omni
word up
hey ya'll don't know where
my mind be
uh huh see I was scatter-brained back before I had a chain
tell me what that'll gain
what's the matter man
pissed off
??? pain
having little ??? with they moves and they attitudes
probably gon' lose
had the same sound when I came 'round on they cruise
man take my name down ???
money-maker with my single
sick with it
get with it
hold something
roll something
man I know my shit fit it
bustin' out the seams
????
nowadays if you need it
you gotta act like you don't sweat it
okie dokie smokie I'm low key
finna turn myself around like the hokie pokie
you know me
I'mma roll a fuckin' swish if you don't
that nigga rap trigga some things

[Pudgemcee]
ayo we burst on the track with words that burn wack
disperse to the world and there's no turning back
burn a sack
twist a cap
it's a celebration
party favors in all bacardi flavors ????
a smorgasbord a soul
from your work corridor to the door of your home
my note stereo in every area code to any speaker that can carry the tone
turn it up
this is a mind altering rhyme offering
trying to keep you knot until your spine softening
crime chalkin' 'em
the beast
six figures on the surveillance video
getting away with the cake and the digi yo
half a mil worth of studio digitals
stealing your attention
cool as a criminals
vinyl junkie
bass line
skip the subliminals
go cancel the trial and the witness interview

[Malkovich]
state of the union
the big sum up
blx, roundtable, ????
malkovich tell 'em who's wearing a suit
bust a clip gun up
swift runner
tearin' ???
enchanted with your countries funny practices
so I sacrifice my life to dance with you savages
mind of a professor
they say I can do better
but rap beats a lecture
and amps beat a projector
so here's the conjecture
editors word
ya'll sub-standard
all text and no texture
I'm a cross-section of the oft-mention
with a little fuck ya'll thrown in for good measure
from good to better to best
whatever the test
I make being the best better
with never the stress
I represent the b
can't forget the l and the x

[Rapper 3]
that's my man malkovich
skeleton in the flesh
sky rock a martini in a dirty glass
blue moon
chewin' shrooms in the sands by the burning man
smoke a bag a hippie in the fonto leaf
crack a mickey on the b
rapper tipsy with them aborigine cats
so eat bats and relapse
swing axes
each hand
bring action
a match
pray ???
heat rash
speak fast and breath hash
in absense of deep cash
street mash or relax
but accent the wheat grass
team samurai
deem classified
master flow
native far from a passerby
rhyme big till my business hit
out for chips and them big tittie brisbane chics
yo om tell me when the next is
I wanna see them aussie hoes do the running man for us
deep like a forrest
rap brontasaurus
you rap dudes are florists
check the historics

[Omni]
yeah
uh
you know what time it is
from up here to the down under
it's the batterie baby</pre>
