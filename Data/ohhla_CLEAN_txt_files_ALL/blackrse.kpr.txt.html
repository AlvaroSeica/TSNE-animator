Song:   The Black Rose
Typed by: DaSun Akbar

(Hook) 2x
I'm the rose and I give this to you
It tears my clothes and this life's so crucial
Prepare the road and this ride's in neutral
Beware of my soul cuz I'm might just shoot you

[Killah Priest]
Love and happiness, drug and marriages
Slugs from a ratchet spit
Secrets of the dead when that casket lift
Bullets left to pull bastard stiff
Mix messages, rich heritage, I come form the Hyksos argot
Six thousand miles thru the strong currents
We survive wit endurance
Made it thru the waves kid
Outrageous, put in cages
Slaves for ages
Somethin' out the Bible pages
What made our survival contagious
This tribal, species endangered
The rose wit the cuts on his clothes
His pedals had fallen in the ghetto
Crowds echo, screams and I seen the Devil
Angels wit the same clothes

(Hook) 2x

[Killah Priest]
Is it the seven in the crescent?
The G in the compass?
Reverend and his message?
It's me in a conflict
Star David - The Mosque or The Masons?
God or the Atheists?
Tomorrow are the ancients
Which way do I go? Which ways do I roll?
New age or the old?
Ways of the crow to the grave in the cold
Or to the grave in the soul wit the sunrays and I can grow
To the pavement on the road
God dealt wit Nations so I deal wit concentration
So deep in conversation
I reap for combination
Read Psalms when I'm shakin'
Call moms when I'm achin'
The Devil's liar, the ghetto's on fire
The level is higher
That's why I'm bandier</pre>
