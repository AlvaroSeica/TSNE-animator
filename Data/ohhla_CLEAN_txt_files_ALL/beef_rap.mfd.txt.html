Beef rap, could lead to gettin teeth capped
Or even a wreath, for Mom Dukes on so-some grief crap
I suggest you change your diet
It could lead to high blood pressure, if you fry it
Or even a stroke, heart attack, heart disease
It ain't no startin back once arteries starts to squeeze
Take a easy way out phony, until then
They know they wouldn't be takin that bologna in the bullpen
So disgustin, pardon self as I discuss this
They talk a wealth of {shit} and that they ain't never seen the justice
Wait that was off the beat - BUST THIS
Like a cool milk from out the toilet
Two batteries, some Brillo and some foil, he'll boil it
He be better off on PC glued
And it's a feud, so don't be in no TV mood
Each week, it's mystery meat - seaweed stewed
Food - we need food
Cause I can't, stop that pimpin any more
I forgot out where I started, pimpin fool

There you go, yeah!  That's good</pre>
