[Intro]
Boss
Four-five off in the ride
Fo' blunts for me to get high
Trilla funk when I ride by

Who the fuck told you I'm finished?
Ricky Ross is strictly business
I got so many bitches
My rims so many inches
I got so many haters
but got so many bullets (holla)
Bitches it's the boss
who reps it to the fullest
M.I., llello, money out the asssssss
Yeah we touchin llello so it's funny that you ask
Whippin hard got me in them different cars
Different girls, same time, call it a menage
It's no co-sign, C-note is trill
Robbers won't rob, they know it's real
They know the deal, they know I deal
They know I have, they know I will

[Chorus]
I'm talkin money, cars, clothes - can you dig it?
And you said you want it hood, let me show you how we get it
Where the bitches gettin love too, hustlers gettin love too
Start huggin, mad Southern gangsters gettin love too
What you ain't heard that we does - gettin love too
Seven-trey bird, Motor World, gettin love too
Probably send them first to who I serve - gettin love too
Smoke with the boss, Ricky Ross, I gets love too

[Rick Ross]
Big wheels on the shit I drive
Big boys wanna deal with I
New stash, niggaz steal my fire
Big blunts got the Benz on fire
Flip flows like I flip dope
Make a nigga get flat for a C-note
Let your boy get stacks like a Arab
Better get back I'm strapped and I blow like C-4
Llello, pesos, big Frank, caseloads
Dollar bills - count 'em up; baddest bitches - round 'em up
All my cars drippin wet, my squad, they get respect
My two ladies baby gangsters; turn your back they'll slit'cha neck
Take your watch, take your spot
Turn that bitch to a vacant lot
They see that face and rocks
They give me face off top
My face be everywhere, I get them heavy stares
Niggaz never stare, they know I'm never scared

[Chorus]

[Rick Ross]
We came from Section 8, so now my section straight
We startin liftin weights, runnin routes, stretchin bass
My team winners, niggaz didn't know (hoe)
We the Dolphins in '72, a clean blow
I done seen blizzards, I'm chillin when it snow
I'm mean with the digits, I'm illin when it's low
I keep my gloves on, keeps the speed fast
I'm burnin green fast (I need I need cash)
She understand my grind, niggaz know my game
It's the R-O-C, rich off cocaine (boss)
My face be everywhere, I get them them heavy stares
Niggaz never stare, I gotta let you know

[Chorus]</pre>
