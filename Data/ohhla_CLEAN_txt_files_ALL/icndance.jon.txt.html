Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Some guys are good at talking to girls
Some guys have all the money in the world
Some guys wear fancy shoes and pants
I'm not one of those guys,
but baby, I can dance
(dance, dance, dance, dance, dance)

I can dance
(dance, dance, dance, dance, dance)
I can dance
(dance, dance, dance, dance, dance)
I can dance
(dance, dance, dance, dance, dance)

Uh uh, ah ah
Uh uh, ah ah

Some guys have friends and they do high-fives
Some guys have parents that are still alive
Some guys don't sit when they pee, they stand
I'm not one of those guys,
but baby, I can dance
(dance, dance, dance, dance, dance)

I can dance
(dance, dance, dance, dance, dance)
I can dance
(dance, dance, dance, dance, dance)
I can dance
(dance, dance, dance, dance, dance)

Everybody, let's count to ten

One
All you've got to do is watch me dance
Two
Keep watching me dance
Three
(Um, uh, hm)
Four

That's my bad. Sorry guys, sorry 'bout that.
Can we just maybe cut back to the choÂ—"

(dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance)
I can dance
(dance, dance, dance, dance, dance)
I can dance
(dance, dance, dance, dance, dance)

Uh uh, ah ah
Uh uh, ah ah

Some guys have money that they've invested
Some guys were never molested
I was though, and, but, em...

Change of music

You've got to stop touching the children
You've got to stop touching the children
Catholic church, we're looking at your direction
You've got to stop touching the children
We're not pointing fingers but, damn, your track record
is bad and getting worse
You've got to stop touching the children
'Vatican' more like 'Old-man-touching-childr-i-can'

Uh uh, ah ah
Uh uh, ah aaaaah</pre>
