This beautiful blend, I knew her through a mutual friend
She was a work of art, a part of my heart from back then
A brown skin singer, with a knack for actin, Alana's whole attraction
Just fractionally based on surface, I got into her mental on purpose
And with alertness, as I flirt with her emotion
Walls we built up out of nervousness was broken
I reminisce on how this Black Thought had her open
Wit da energy that got the whole summertime smokin very hypnotized
When it was time we spent time
It's no way to rewind or prevent
time from slipping away like day, into the dark
and the way that things fall apart, will make some start
to feel more, weak or insecure
But for whatever reason our relationship remain mature
Even when she caught feelings cuz I stay on tour
As I reflect on before, and recap the situation
I guess from experience, comes education
We set on a path to opposite destinations
It's best to chalk it up and add it to the elevation
Then eventually flow on to lost communication
I called but lost all information
And with time forgot it, it's not like I'm all in tears about it
But the fact still remains that I miss the Hypnotic

Chorus: repeat 2X

You're a shinin' star
No matter where you are
For the world to see
What you truly be

She was the hypnotic, and potent as a narcotic
the bizarre logic of it all, is why the clock tick
pages of the calendar flip, we can't stop it
time will either tell the tale, or turn a love toxic
now was she real, or an illusion of this optical
confusion with the accent of ancient Egypt
or could it be that she's the one I was supposed to be with
and together walked this twisted, staircase is somethin realistic
damn, her lips having me addicted to her presence
front page material on essence, a queen, imperial before her 
adolescence
and as she grew into a woman she became refine
I never knew another like her in my lifetime
so now I travel through a tunnel of space, without a place
on the face of this earth, with this pain gettin worse
drivin me insane, or release I'm touchin the brink, of sanity
to think of how I can link, or contact her
I was a fool before, but more wise after the fact
I'm analyzin how I'm wantin her back
and wonderin exactly where she could be on the map
I'm just sittin here spinning the world on one finger
reoccuring thoughts of this brown skin singer
yo, the psychotic, the hypnotic, yo check it out
the most melodic hypnotic, yeah

Chorus 4X

You're my shinin star
No matter where you are
Dont know what to say
Was it true to be</pre>
