[Omega Black]
I remember struggling, way before bubbling
Way before getting in trouble, when
Life was much more simple then, less frustration
Way before the heart breaking...
When I dreamed about being grown and out on my own and well established
My ideas added up like mathematics
And then I ran in a static, felt as if God wasn't having it
My life was so unmanaged
I remember getting chicks, before I became chipped up
Where my only concern was, mics getting ripped up
Back in junior high, before I caught a coke high
Before it was time, then I caught a sparkle in my eye
Back before it was time, for me to get in girl's thighs
The lord, had a bigger blessing, for me in the sky
It's like he been looking down on me, from up in the sky
And saving my black ass, and I don't know why
Maybe it's because of the love that he touch my life
And made a brother think twice
Feeling alone in the storm, and I'm not knowing which way I'm going
But I'm knowing I've been living trife
Got to find a way out of the maze, of henny and purple haze
And watching my moms struggle, got plans, for better days
It's so many different ways of getting out...

[Chorus: Popa Chief]
Yo, if my momma only knew I roll with killas and blood spillas
And drug dealers, and murderers and gangstas
She'd probably a fit, go upside my head with the good book
Talking bout, 'your ass better quit'
If my momma only knew I smoke weed
All the way to the liquor I speed, and dogs would greed
She'd probably a fit, go upside my head with the good book
Talking bout, 'your ass better quit'

[Popa Chief]
The whoopings I received as a child, my greatest hits
The ghetto is all I know, and it's the shit
Snotnose with a crumb snatcher, pocket book, purse checker
Hub cap gripper, upper, no pops, just a momma, hood love, hood drama
Usually followed by a comma, TG, I made it, got my diploma
Uncle Sam made me an expert killer
Got team and a deuce need the marijuana
Herbs go to college, thugs play the corner
Play pitch and catch with the rocks and boulders if you wanna
Some do the pimp thing, shorty work the pole thing
I send kites out to my niggas in the bing
Don't give up hope, don't drop the hope
Will it really matter if I vote? Pick up a gun, nope
I choose the rap game to earn my change
They say it ain't no way out, but I found a way out
Without robbing and stealing, brandishing and cap peeling
Sleazy business and underhanded dealings
Eliminate the dead weight, do the knowledge, elevate
Now everybody eat off my plate, I found my way out...
