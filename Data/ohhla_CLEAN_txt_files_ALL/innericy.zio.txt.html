[Intro] [Zumbi talking]
Yo, yo what's happening? Peace, love. Protection and guidance
Zion I crew, massive, youknowhatimsayin? DJ Amp Live Productions
Dave the engineer, youknowhatimsayin? For the hip hop heads worldwide
We got beats

"Elevation"
You know the time
"Elevation"
You know the time
Shine
"Manifest"

[Verse One]
I haunted psycho kinetical power so forged
Hotter than chili sauce, like Broadway we large
Travel with force of course I'm here to endorse
My ship is on course, without Jah I'd be lost
Reachin' every shore
Heart pure, I'll get it there
Open my mouth to fire prayers in the air
Guidance from the North Star, hum to the Lord
Soon as I step out my door I'm at war
Battle fatigues, full metal jacket, yo I'm red
To step into the forth dimension, can't forget
My pad and my pen, my messages send
Will blend like colors of the rainbow to the very end of time
Will drop rhymes
Candlelight shine
Peace and love to all the Zodiac signs

[Chorus] [x2]
Life is one big road with lots of signs
"Manifestation"
Let your inner light shine
Let your inner light shine
"Relax your mind" - EPMD 'You Gots To Chill'

[Verse Two]
I be the deep brother believer
Lyric miracle weaver
Always takin' ya deeper
Collie keep the cheeba
Special feats
Amp Live got the keys to the Jeep
To 4 Wheel Drive right through ya speaker
Nice to meet
Read your piece for release
The beats, we face the east and sink into the ether
Sleep and walk
Slang talk
Get my flash of light and then I peak into the dark
Like the Arc Of The Covenant
We discover it
In the middle of the desert in Mahat you dubbin' it, yo
Take our picture
Freeze frame photo
Guide you to a land of fantasy like Toto
Breathe slow
Then listen to the demo
Everything you want, work on it now, not tomorrow

[Chorus] [x2]
Life is one big road with lots of signs
"Manifestation"
Let your inner light shine
Let your inner light shine
"Relax your mind" - EPMD 'You Gots To Chill'

Break down
"I feel great" - Eric B. &amp; Rakim 'Paid In Full'
"Cause I'm righteous" - Eric B. &amp; Rakim 'Paid In Full'

[Verse Three]
Yo, yo
We bring scripture, lift ya
And it hit like Rumi
Tunes like Looney, knock out ya Gerry Cooney
Gold gloves
Body blows bring love
You sweatin' in the gym with Him so big it up
I live life
Walkin' the line that's type trife
What's right for me, don't mean it's right for you
Just give me my space baby pa
Respect due
We can, be hella cool if ya want to
But leave the judgment to the one above you
No space for a throne, my home
When I roam, self realization up on the microphone
Designated by a one, champion, chief son
Never puttin' down my mic 'fore my lyrics is done
That's right son/sun
Because she shine like one
Yo
"Peace"

[Chorus] [x2]
Life is one big road with lots of signs
"Manifestation"
Let your inner light shine
So let your inner light shine
"Relax your mind" - EPMD 'You Gots To Chill'

Yo
[Scratches]
"Peace"
"Elevation"</pre>
