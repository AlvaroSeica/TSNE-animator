[Verse 1]
I caught a gun case when I was just a young juvenile
Mr. Gonzalez now you in the gang profile
Shit's tough
How do I explain this to my mother?
She'll never understand that I try to be like my older brother's
Baggy pants, cortez and my hoodie on
Meeting girls tryna see who I can get pussy from
Most of you rap about it but you never lived it
I've seen my enemies in critical conditions
I'm on a mission, Mom's gettin suspicious
I pissed on my hands that's why I didn't go to prison
They gave my brother 32 cause he didn't listen
His girl was a witness, now she's in court snitchin'
This is a crazy ass world
Law of the king, don't put your trust in a fucken girl
We live life to the fullest, drug sales and bullets
Grab the nine and fucken pull it

[Chorus]
Teardrops in my mother's eyes
I was wrong, I realize
Drama keeps following
I feel like death keeps calling me
I feel like death keeps calling me
I feel like death keeps calling me
Click, Click, Bang, Bang
Click, Click, Bang, Bang

[Verse 2]
Back when I wore black cortez
My mother checking in my room and I'm not there
Walkin' through my neighborhood with big ass pants
Crossing out my enemies with a black can
I'm not an OG, I hate the new school
Cause motherfuckers are gang bangin' on YouTube
When was the last time you shot a gun?
I got stories of bullshit I did for fun
I was young, raised in the slums
Up in Mexico, I got a few plugs
Tell my homies up in prison
I'm sending you pictures of bad bitches
Wishin' that we could kick it
I'm tryna maintain, but my mind's corrupted
Drug money comes fast but it amounts to nothing
I can't stop my persona's too arrogant
Never fear shit it's in my blood, I'm a Mexican!

[Chorus]</pre>
