[Verse 1]
They thought we was over the soul of a Zulu warrior
Blew open and rose from my coffin murdered the coroner
Story of niggas who survived through the livest streets and the harshest conditions
Niggas condoning sin like its part of religion
Part of me grinning part of me smiling part of me sinning part of me wilding
The architects wanna snipe us so it's hard to be righteous
Poverty's rampant when you're black yo it's hard to be banking
So we look up in the sky pray to god and we thank him
For all the blessings the children the trees the air we breathing
To the cold stare of the murderer while the victim's weeping
Sinking deep in this pool of evil the root of evil
Is taking over and ruling my people Rastafarian Soul
Hostile Safari they hunt us, fronting like they sorry won't stop
Till they take everything from us
Raping out mothers molesting our daughters brainwashing us
Constantly watching us we lurking in the darkness my nigga

[Chorus x2 Â– Tweeta Bird]
Yes we moving on the Zion, clearing out obstacle from out of me way
Yes we moving on to Zion, freedom is a must we haffi get it some day

[Verse 2]
We the smartest in this modern era martyrs like Marcus Garvey
And Martin Luther using ways to get out of poverty sooner
From rocking Pumas to rocking gators to knocking nocturnal booty
Getting these thick hotties knocked with a baby
Now you rocking baby popping the baby nice for cheddar
Till the feds get cha now you locked up with a baby
Now the drama high ya baby crying babymama crying
Realizing you a slave to the dollar signs
They weeped for Columbine we speak with the foulest lines
Used to have dream but the United States demolished mine
I got a polished mind packed with knowledge and science
Dodging them bullets daily from lamas in the line of fire
Loading the nine to fire avoiding the 9 to 5
For the grans now the fans downloading the LimeWire
Now its going down the wire, you know the sound is fire
Spark and ignite a riot, marching on our way to Zion

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Hale Selassie Street philosophy never taught us democracy
Taught us to each his own taught us to rob and squeeze the chrome
Blasphemy over Jerusalem where Jesus roam
Using atomic energy using oozies to prove a point
Divide and conquered us niggas devised a master plan
Like u, give me Pakistan I'll give u back Afghanistan
They play chess with our countries using our goods to bargain
Setting foot and barging in from DC to the hoods in Harlem
We in the hood stalling, we popping our hoods and balling
Basket and footballing, practicing to put a ball in
Fire ratchets they digging coffins to put us all in
And catching assault charges got prisons to put us all in
Designed a system to control us and they pull us all in
A full assault on my morals and my body's exhausted
But we keep getting up, fuck it if we start crawling
All in it together they fear, when they hear us calling</pre>
