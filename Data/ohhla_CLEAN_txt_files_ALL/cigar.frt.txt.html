(yea..go ahead man..cue the special effects...)

Man I love this rapgame, mainly cause it's cool
To add a little spice to the life you've been through
Everyone exaggerates a tiny little bit
Make that shit sound more gangsta then it really is
You can't appear weak man, we wanna hear street
We wanna hear you spit your thug over this here beat
Don't take it as sarcastic, I can't get enough
I'm telling you, you can call my bluff
If it's not rough?, Then I really don't need it
I'm not even ashamed; I got too much reality that's fucking up my brain
So sell me on that product, I'm addicted to the game
Suck it up like a cigarette, light it up man

[Chorus]
(It's just like a cigarette something that I do
Once in a while but between me and you
It's just like a cigarette, nobody's really fooled
I don't want the truth I just wanna feel fucking cool)

Let me tell you something that I realized tonight
My hip-hop radio's like Marlboro light
They both telling stories and they sound about the same
Cigarettes say they safe, rappers claim they really bang
We don't care if it's true, but we just lay the money down
We don't believe the words, we just love the way they sound
They're acting like we're idiots they're lying to our face
Maybe we are idiots, we buy it anyway
I'm running out to get the next rappers cd
Just sucking up the guns, drugs and misogyny
The same way that I suck up all the stories when I breathe
That little bit of death supposedly cancer free
And everything they say's got the truth twisted up
And twisted up's what I want man, I can't get enough
Cause even though we know it's all just a big bluff
We just light another up, what we don't give a fuck!!!

[Chorus]
(It's just like a cigarette something that I do
Once in a while but between me and you
It's just like a cigarette, nobody's really fooled
I don't want the truth I just wanna feel fucking cool)
It's just like a cigarette something that I do
Over and over but between me and you
It's just like a cigarette, nobody's really fooled
I don't want the truth I just wanna feel fucking cool)

Man listen to my words, listen for a while
lip service radio don't touch the dial
If your in the car turn up the track man
Give your whole neighborhood some second hand rap,hey
Matter of fact man, listen for a while
lip service radio don't touch the dial
If your in the car man turn up the track man give your whole
neighborhood some second hand rap

[Chorus]</pre>
