World if I grow old (World if I grow old)
I be shocked myself (I be shocked myself)
Cuz only Lord knows (Cuz only Lord knows)
All the pain I was dealt (All the pain I was dealt)
I should kill myself (I should just kill myself)
And get it all over with (And get it all over with)
But then I stop and think (But then I stop and think)
That's the life that I live (That's the life that I live) 
World if I grow old  (World if I grow old)
I be shocked myself (I be shocked myself)
Cuz only Lord knows (Cuz only Lord knows)
All the pain I was dealt (All the pain I was dealt)
I should kill myself (I should just kill myself)
And get it all over with (And get it all over with)
But then I stop and pray (But then I stop and pray)
Lord watch over me (Lord watch over me) </pre>
