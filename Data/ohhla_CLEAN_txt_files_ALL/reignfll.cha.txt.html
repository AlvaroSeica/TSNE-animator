[Intro: Scarface] + (Chamillionaire)
(They just wanna see the rain fallin, fallin)
All the fallen soldiers, I love y'all man, I miss y'all
But we can't look back, we gotta look ahead
(They just wanna see the rain fallin)
Yeah (but ain't no cloudy days in a world so gray)
They be goin

[Chamillionaire]
They just wanna see the weather fallin on my crown
I just hope to never let you down, down
Rain fallin; they just wanna see the rain fallin
But ain't no cloudy days in a world so gray
Look up, I can see the weather droppin to the ground
I just hope you never let me drown, drown
Ooh-oooh ooh, they just want to see the rain fallin
But ain't no cloudy days even headed my way
Uh - I'm tryin to take a tres, and flip it to a seis
If real recognize real then you sure look out of place
They took out all the greats, they want 'em all replaced
They try to tell me it's curtains, I open all the drapes
Like "Lord, let the sun shine while your son shine"
Might be a gateway into heaven but it's one line
And I'm a soldier, loyal is the only way I know
Sincerely yours, the Chamillitary G.I. Joe
See life chose us but we chose the life we livin
We speak with fate and then we say those are likely written
Snakes come with the cake, oh looks like he's bitten
Your life's a gift but I'm like, "Who knows if life's a given?"
Dress casual at birth, at death we wearin suits
Feel like it's a special occasion if you want the truth
They say forgive your enemies but if we never truce
A born sinner so at least I didn't forget my roots

[Chorus: Chamillionaire] + (Bobby Moon)
(Falling) Rain fallin
(So just keep on calling for me) Rain fallin
They just wanna see the rain fallin
But ain't no cloudy days in a world so gray
(Falling) Rain fallin
(So just keep on calling for me) Ooh-oooh ooh
They just wanna see the rain fallin
But ain't no cloudy days even headed my way

[Chamillionaire]
Uhh, we look around and see nobody left to idolize
Cause we just waitin 'til these newer guys run out of lies
Exaggerated all the rumor talk of our demise
Then we rise up just like "What's up?" and they apologize
Surprise, the storm is comin so I wish you luck
Protect yourself cause if you don't then you might self-destruct
Go 'head and live it up, make sure you live enough
Pour out some liquor for the soldiers that didn't get to duck
What's up

[Chorus]

[Break: Scarface]
Yeah, ha, back, boy, hahahaha
You ever thought you was movin forward and
all of a sudden you realize you was goin backwards man?
It's kinda like my whole life has been man
So, I'ma take some time out and give it to you
Ya dig?

[Scarface]
If there's a heaven up above, show a nigga love
Cause I been strugglin in blood, tryin to make it back to where I was
I shed a tear for the lost souls caught up in the street life
Livin fast, die young, y'all know what them streets like
Ain't nothin new, we goin through it day to day
Doin bad in the hood, broke as fuck, so it's hard to pray
We hustle harder yet the cops keep callin
And they Glocks keep clickin, we cannot keep fallin nigga

[Killer Mike]
I started small time, dope game, cocaine
Gettin schooled by the O.G.'s of the game mayne
I got the jewelry and the shit that came with rollin hard
I got jammed with the toaster and I took a charge
The prosecutor tried to hit me with a sweet deal
I told that bitch to suck a dick like it's a sweet meal
My character hold no resemblance to a damn rat
So I refuse to be used by a pussycat
A nigga judge gave a young nigga 10 years
My baby mama cried 10 time 100 tears
100 nights in the cell, I've cried too
My momma died last year, I kinda wish I died too
But I can't, I gotta be here for my baby daughter
Niggaz that I'm doin time for won't even pay the lawyer
And I'm stressin and depressin on this crazy drama
O.G. flexin tryin to fuck a nigga baby mama

[Chorus]

[Outro: Scarface]
Ay, word from the wise man, always look ahead
Never look behind you
What happened yesterday is done
So, make your next move your best move</pre>
