[Intro]
"Rags, to riches, rag-rags, to riches" {*8X*}

[Wafeek]
I went from.. uh
I went from, rags to riches, that's two worlds and one suck
So I'm shittin on bitches like, two girls one cup
Nah pimpin! That was too much as one love
For all my women that done used up they young lung
Suckin with authority, orally
leave stretch marks 'round her neck like Kimora Lee
Simmons then I hit 'em with the steady swag, tell 'em that
Justin Timberlake brought sexy back, Feeky turnin sexy black
So let me have it, nigga ask me where the fetti at
Beat it like a heavy bag then beat it like your deadbeat daddy
That's why they cain't be happy, hoes on the D don't know
what they want, but they know, what I need, yeah
Knahmean? Nah, you really had to be there
In home economics class, tryin to bag a female
The cool kids foolin wit'cha kid sister
Nigga please~! You cain't transform like me
I went from "rags, to riches, rag-rags, to riches"</pre>
