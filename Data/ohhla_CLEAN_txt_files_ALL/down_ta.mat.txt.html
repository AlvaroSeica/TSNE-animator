[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Just chilling on top of the hill with my man Mathematiks
Showing brothers how we get down
From the nine six beyond
This is the last day
But we got to wake up, straight up

[Mathematik]
I helped raise the gods up and change the odds up
And take over songs that manifest for ya
Become a revolutionary like Sister Rosa
For biters, writers, non-fighters and soldiers
I send my knowledge back to my people black
In fact, you see others will listen
When it's the Asiatic mission
Niggas be on the court hitching
A ball of poison up inside the kitchen
When I collect my thought I'm mentally enriching
Yo, close to the end times, I'm about to correct mine
An internationaly plan to check rhymes
See the nine six, full of frauds and mad tricks
But we just about had it
So enter Mathematik, to clear up all the static
Yo, the message is this my niggas on the street need to wake up
Straight up, realize the nineties are bait up

[Chorus]
Cause every positive move you think of making the devils anticipating 
You might debate, you might just,
Learn to earn cause I'm righteous (Learn to earn cause I'm righteous)

[Mathematik]
My mind state elevates everyday I concentrate on societies state
You see the time to motivate and caplets
But the lockdown situation frustrates
And it does state the facts that black on black 
Is not the way to react. so the gods attack
And a Down Ta Erf session bring the real shit back
Yo, the metal 1200's always got my back
When my rhyme style prevails
You'll have to wonder what's real
Not the past or future, a present ideal
So you might just learn to earn cause I'm righteous

[Chorus]
Yo, yo, yo, weither you praise Jah, Allah or self just know
Take no shorts and lay low
Cause every positive move you think of making the devils anticipating
You might debate, you might just, learn to earn cause I'm righteous (Learn to earn cause I'm righteous)

[Mathematik]
Evidence relates every rhyme I state
And as the puzzle collects links its notes to take
And awake niggas act don't think
Full of scriptures of the devil's inc. and as a host I hint
Variable parables to my people of tint
So they can unvail the words that's real in hell
Born to re-write the arts then tip the scale
So Mathematikal static can rain on nigga's like hell
Build up the stockpile, like knowledge to a child
Come through first like empire from New York
Alley, my style a, is (?raley?)
And with this record on enalisis, I'll let you know my message is this

[Chorus]
yo, weither you praise Jah, Allah or self just know
Take no shorts and lay low
Cause every positive move you think of making the devils anticipating
You might debate, you might just, learn to earn cause I'm righteous
(Learn to earn cause I'm righteous)

[Outro]
The message is this, the niggas on the street need to wake up
Straight up</pre>
