HOLIDAY SEASON!!
{*TRAPAHOLICS*}

[Nicki Minaj]
Yo, yo, listen, okay, now now now
Now I'm a dime, you a nickelette, light skinneded pig-i-ment
Write my own shit, y'all copyrightin infringement
I eat these rap bitches, somebody get me a dinner mint
Pussy make him tattoo my name up on his ligament
Fuck wrong with dem? My nerves they keep tweakin
Tell 'em I'm the chief, I'm runnin with Mohicans
Tell 'em this is church, and tell 'em I am the deacon
Tell 'em that I'm black, Chinese, and butter peacon
Pull up in the Range, I'm givin them more reasons
Hit up Lil Wayne, while I'm in the Fo' Seasons
Tell Gutta Mac, and Kid Kid I'm here
I'm colder than a cough, I'm wetter then swim wear
Got all these lil' bitches g-gettin p-pink hair
I'm pretty and I'm fly, I'm up in the pink Lear
I needed an assistant, I got me a pink queer
Decorated his office with flowers and pink chairs (chairs)

Listen {*laughter*} Nicki Minaj, Nicki Lewinksy
The Mistress; where the fuck is the President?
Ha ha, Young Money!</pre>
