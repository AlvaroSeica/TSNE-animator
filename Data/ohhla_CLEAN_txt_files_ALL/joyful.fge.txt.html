[Lauryn]
Joyful, joyful
Lord we adore Thee
God of Glory, Lord of Love
Hearts unfold like flowers before Thee
Clearly as the sun above
Melt the clouds of sin and sadness
Drive the dark of doubt away
Giver of immortal gladness
Fill us with the light
Fill us with the light
Oh fill us with the light of day

*Beat Starts*

[Chorus: Choir]
Joyful, joyful
Lord we adore Thee
God of Glory, Lord of Love
Hearts unfold like flowers before Thee
Clearly as the sun above
Melt the clouds of sin, sin and sadness
Drive the dark of doubt away
Drive it away
Giver of immortal gladness
Fill us 
Fill us with the light of day
Light of day

[Rapper 1]
Check the rhyme
Joyful, joyful
Lord we adore Thee
And in my life I could not afford Thee
'Cos as youngster I came to know
That you were the only way to go

[Rapper 2]
So I had to grow and I come to an understanding
And I'm down with the King
So no-one comanded
You tell me "Who you down with" see
All I know is that I'm down with G.O.D
You know G.O.D

[Choir]
Yeah, you know me

[Rapper 1]
You know G.O.D

[Choir]
Yeah, you know me

[Rapper 2]

[Lauryn and Girls]
Join the mighty chorus
The mighty mighty chorus
Which the morning stars become
The Father of Love is mighty glorious

[Choir]
By the way!
What have you done for Him lately
Ooooh yeah (Oh)
What have you done for Him lately
He watches over everthing
So we sing!
