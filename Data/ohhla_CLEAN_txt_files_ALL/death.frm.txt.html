[Intro: the record reversing followed by 8 Bars...with Pun cuts]

[Verse One: Need Not Worry]
Now we all know.... that growing up is just another problem
and recognizing it is just another stardom
the horror of the horrible, and when you're starting to
take a breath it trips you up and takes another part of you
the type of shit that makes the life a hit or miss
or you can take the easy way and put a slice upon the wrist
a clean...cut fellow, working, with a wife and kid
but the demons that he tucked away were steady stalking him
dirty kinda like the way the gutters get
when there's a nest in it and every bird just likes to fly and shit
piling up...like the stress and nerve that got him winding up
pressure gauge boiling, cuttin on the diamonds ruff
gotta recognize that he died a couple times
like in 85, stole a car and caught on in the thigh
rise and fall, ten olock news, check it yall
unidentified duo take another liquor store...
..cops are 10-4...another score
under their belt, but they never forfeit or fail
with the destiny of jail cells path of a trail
with breadcrumbs and a lumpsum, very cumbersome...

Hook: 4 bar hook(cuts)

[Verse Two: Need Not Worry]
It's fucked up..the man had two lives concealed
underneath one and they're undeniably real
you can blame it on his buddy that had got him living crooked
or you blame the neighborhood that grabbed a hold of him and took him
cus as an adolescent you be livin for the present
not the past, thats for the future to grasp
and thats where this man is..., right between
a loving father and a criminal that has the matchin handprints
kinda hard to try to live a life of dirt
when you be cleaner than a whistle to your family first
this ain't a fantasy, a movie, nor a television entity
a breathing documentary of hero and the enemy
THE TRUTH..when his father died....no tears fell
but emotion was the action if you listen as the years tell
cus they were speakin out.....screamin bout
B&amp;E, armed robbery, before you heard a shout
but he did it on the low-key..a mouth muffled
never want to talk about he used to sniff and smoke weed
go back to 10 oclock, hear the BEEP BEEP
as the child sleeps, wife buggin like "we need speak"

Hook: 4 bar hook(cuts)

[Verse Three: Need Not Worry]
Now its over, out the door, mental back up off me
mind a mile a minute like he sniffin with some coffee
we all know getting old, so difficult..
job get dispicable, and family is so critical
nothing like a long day around the jobsite
then going home to get away but hear it from your wife
child with homework, karate, and little league
want to be the father figure but you're feeling too fatigued
add it up.overdose. measure with the high stress
thrill is doing crimes, to smoothen out the mind set
too bad he didn't know it be the last one
saw the cops coming so he had to fuckin blast them
a long shootout...middle of it froze up
life flashed before, and started with the old stuff
first image of his father was a tough one
last one;wife and kid, just a little rougher
and every other image that he seen in between
was a chapter of the horror film he lived as he breathed
he lets go, last step, smile as the past left
took his last breath, and now he meets his last death

Hook: 8 bar to fade...just let it go</pre>
