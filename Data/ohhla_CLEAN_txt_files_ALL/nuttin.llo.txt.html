[Intro: Lounge Lo]
Yeah, yeah, thanks to the peoples, man
Thanks to the peoples man, (yeah, I see you)
The Stones, we home man, what's up? Let's go
Riz, what up? Let's go

[Lounge Lo]
I'm doing numbers down South Carolina, hittin' vagina
Something nice, getting money with this chick Latania
Blowing haze with country bumpkins, crack head pumpkin
Told me to get me something, to get me jumping
Whispered in her her ear "it's like a hundred percent"
And baby girl, I'm up north, you know money is nothing
Park Hill, Staten Island, where it ain't no fronting
We take gwop, straight to the top, with the sword from pumping
Gotta fetish for the cheddar, my people, dope is lethal
And the weed give you lock jaw like sour diesel
Take a flick of the powder, the weasel, three quarter, white Nikes
Up high, because that's how B do, ain't nothing gonna stop the kid
I had them crackhead barbershop niggas with the arch to ridge
Layed up in Far Rockaway, my bark is big
Right on price, deep, where the Barker's live
Yes Lord, the Brim and the Stoney, the beef and the beast
Lingering Stone, been home, and I've been creeping the streets

[Chorus 4X: Lounge Lo]
Ain't nothing gonna stop the kid, the kid, the kid

[Lounge Lo]
Now I see all the hate and the love, I know this chick on my block
Yeah, my sister, put her face in the mud
And swinging belts, no relation to thug, it's a family affair
Now tell Tough, come and taste the slug
The bench potato, who grind out and grinch for paper
O.G. got a connect, that'll lynch the hater
Pardor self for a pinch of the wager, I know dudes
That'll come eat your food and don't tip the waiter
And pass guns to the chicks when the cops roll up
Take or sale, if I get locked, get the block sowed up
Here's the crack, here's the cash, here's the wop, blow up
But if I'm in, send me some Timbs, and some pot to roll up
It's the legendary, who never worry, it's true story
Lounge Mode Lo, and the move to boo shorty
I'm not too gully, too live, too sporty
But I fuck with them youngins like Belly at two-forty

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
