[Ace 1]
"Dallas"
"Dal-Dallas"
"Dal"
"Dallas, of the palace, where the marriage is from"
"Dal-Dallas, of the palace, where the marriage is from"
"Dal-Dallas, of the palace, where the marriage is from"
"Livin' lavished, I'm established til the cabbage'll come"
"Dallas, of the palace, where the marriage is from"
"Dal-Dallas, of the palace, where the marriage is from"
"Dal-Dallas, of the palace, where the marriage is from"
"Livin' lavished, I'm established til the cabbage'll come" --&gt; Slim Thug

[Verse 1: Big Gemini]
I'm in the land of the money, hungry, home of the trill
T-E-X-A-S, bitch, you know what's the deal
See these stars, see these T's, see these (???) jerseys
If we ain't on the map, well shit, just leave it to me
You reppin' yours, motherfucker, shit, I gotta rep mine
I'm with a tee, on my fedi' wild, I'm up in NY
Hey, I ain't got no grill, so don't ask me to smile
You better save that for Cam or that boy Paul Wall
Get it
Texas made, in the Lone Star State
Fuck ya cowboy boots, this Timbos on my feet
Some boys bear the names, I rather rock a white tee
Go against ya dress code and still be V.I.P.
Bitch, I'm on my grind, gotta stay up
On it
Peddle to the metal, never let up
Off it
Got love for my fedi, my city love me
If you want it, come and get it, bitch, you know where I be
I'm out in Dallas

Chorus: Ace 1 (Big Gemini)
"Dallas, of the palace, where the marriage is from" (We reppin'...)
"Dal-Dallas, of the palace, where the marriage is from" (We out in...)
"Dal-Dallas, of the palace, where the marriage is from" (Yeah
"Livin' lavished, I'm established til the cabbage'll come"
"Dallas, of the palace, where the marriage is from" (Eastside)
"Dal-Dallas, of the palace, where the marriage is from" (Westside)
"Dal-Dallas, of the palace, where the marriage is from" (Northside)
"Livin' lavished, I'm established til the cabbage'll come" (Southside)

[Verse 2: Big Gemini {Big Gemini *slowed down*}]
I'm on a mission and they say it's impossible
Shit, I ain't dyin' (Bruise)
But I still hurdle any obstacle
Let's move on, time to bring this back home
To the city of the fuckin' giant microphone
Where them hustlers hustle
Where them grinders go grind
Money gets stack up in bundles
When there's demand, you supply
Where them thugs, cause they tussle
And them hoes super fine
That means we knock out grill shit and knock down (Dimes)
Get it
I'm in the driver seat, grippin' the grain (The grain)
Windows rolled down so you can hear my bang (My bang)
Snow White Cadillac, nickname cocaine
And the Spanish passenger, they say she gave good brain
H-Town, yeah, they swang and gave birth to {Screw}
D-Town birth me and bang out Screw out
I got love for the H, but shit, I'm bringing it back
Back to the city that they say is next to blow on the map
I'm reppin' Dallas

Repeat Chorus

Hook: Big Gemini
If you a muh'fuckin' G
Go and rep it for the D
Eastside, westside, muh'fuckers, where you at
If you a motherfuckin' G
Go and rep it for the D
Northside, southside, muh'fuckers, where you at
Go 'head and rep that (REP THAT)
Rep that (REP THAT)
Rep that (REP THAT)
Rep that (REP THAT)
If you a motherfuckin' G
And you rep it for the D
Go 'head and throw your hood high and let 'em know where we be
We out in Dallas

Repeat Chorus
