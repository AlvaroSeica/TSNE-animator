[Chorus]
When I get a million, gator-toed reptilian
Lamborghini killing 'em, money at my cei-li-ing
When I get my bread up, like I got a bread truck
If I got a pot to piss in, when I lift my head up
See me on top (yeah)
See me on top (yeah)
See me on top (yeah)
See me on top (yeah)
See me on top

[Big K.R.I.T.]
All I want is money, all I see is paper
I don't owe you shit, motherfuck a favor
Motherfuck a hater, praying to my maker
Tomorrow ain't promised, I might just see him later
I might just get my cake up and never have to rap
I might just sell a million and never hit the trap
House full of plaques, wall full of racks
I might get me a bad bitch and never come back
like how he done that? Fly above the struggle
Past in my trunk, future in my duffle
Emerge from the rubble, cracks in the streets
If I had a chance, but 'if' is all I need

[Chorus]
When I get a million, gator-toed reptilian
Lamborghini killing 'em, money at my cei-li-ing
When I get my bread up, like I got a bread truck
If I got a pot to piss in, when I lift my head up
See me on top (see me on top)
See me on top (see me on top)
See me on top (see me on top)
See me on top (see me on top)
See me on top

[Big K.R.I.T.]
All I want is peace, what the fuck is pain?
You can work for bullshit, I can't do the same
I'm deep in the game, shit will drive you crazy
Signed once or twice, now look at how they played me
Bet you think they paid me, bet you think I blew it all
Mad cause I'm from Mississippi, scared cause I do it all
What you mean you do it all? Yeah, I really do it all
Produce and mix my own shit, out-rap all of y'all
Labels scared to take a fall, they ain't really signing checks
Check this, for the non-believers asking why I ain't signed yet
Asking why I ain't down yet, like what I'm supposed to do?
I'm Big K.R.I.T. bitch, so who this fuck is you?!

[Chorus]
When I get a million, gator-toed reptilian
Lamborghini killing 'em, money at my cei-li-ing
When I get my bread up, like I got a bread truck
If I got a pot to piss in, when I lift my head up
See me on top
See me on top
See me on top
See me on top
See me on top
