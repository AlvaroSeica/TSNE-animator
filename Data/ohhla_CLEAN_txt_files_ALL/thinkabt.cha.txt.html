[Intro/Chorus]
If you ain't never spent a night with me, then try it
Cause she can't be too fast with too much speed, and mileage
The ugly one always talkin like she, the hottest
But we ain't never trippin we be G's, about it
I'm gettin knowledge just like I got B's, in college
You know she almost fainted when she seen, my closet
And if you just like me you get plen-ty, deposits
If she ain't bring a friend then she should think, about it

[Chamillionaire]
Heh heh, hold up~!
Got so many cars see 'em soon as I walk out a do'
Whole bunch of colors in my view like a kaleidoscope
Women in the kitchen makin grits and cuttin artichokes
Plus they watchin movies I ain't with that Perry, Tyler though
Babygirl your face is cute I don't know 'bout that body doe
I would love to stay and chat but money talks I got a show
Got a few that's creole but they don't be jammin zydeco
They be jammin that Koopa and say that boy Z-Ro got a flow
Shout out to my hoes in Dallas, got some girls in Funkytown
Dropped that Major Pain they say that pain what they be bumpin now
They used to jam them other boys, them other boys be suckin now
I ain't even gonna tell 'em what his girl is suckin nowwwww~!
Bust it out, then I'm gon' bust it in
I can't stand when she tryin to say she can't because her friend
Don't be a follower, just swallow up this cup of gin
You know where to meet me, ring the bell and I'm gon' buzz ya in

[Chorus]

[Chamillionaire]
Say she ain't a groupie but she says she want a autograph
I just want some knowledge just point me to where your college at
Got some Andre and 3000, it's like I was part of 'Kast
If you get too drunk then get a driver and go call a cab
Knew that she was wasted she kept askin me to buy the tabs
Saw another bad one but her man had saw I spotted dat
Then she turned and looked at me and really that's what got him mad
He gon' mess around and get beat up in need of body casts
When I'm gettin choose, what they be expectin me to do?
Met a bougie chick that's tellin me that she don't need a boo
Take a look at you then take a good look at my vehicle
What I'm drivin make me feel like I should be conceited too
Got a army you know the Chamillitary hold it down
Hit the afterparty, call it work and call it overtime
You can't see how I be shinin baby then you know you're blind
Got a attitude but get a pass because you know you're fine

[Chorus]</pre>
