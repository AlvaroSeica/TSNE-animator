[Verse One]
I start beef on dark streets, cursing the transients
Take your pick of your latest whip, hearse or an ambulance
Cause I'm a scientist to the rescue
Who wish to infect you with contaminants from a test-tube
I pop up on the scene unexpectedly
All up in your city like teen mother pregnancy
Fiends love my tendency to serve dope
Cause I mesh with rap like a pimp in feathered hats and a fur coat
Curtains close the ??????? like ?????????
Lock you up in fresh wears and let you go in dirty clothes
I'm naked wear my words exposed
Disturbing folks performing bourbon soaked at suburban shows
Alert the pope and you better call a doctor
I'm going off my rocker when I chug a quart of vodka
And just before the cops come I'll face a hundred dudes
Like, "I'm Louis Logic, who the fuck are you?"

[Verse Two]
Plain and simple, ordinary Jack's same as nimble
Plus you lack the sack if your main veins are thimble
I hang my head over the pane of windows
Throwing up like, L.A. gang signs or graf paint in scribbles
Blowing up's a far stretch
With Indy B-sides I'm hard pressed, for a free ride like car theft
I'm a hard head; I gotta chill with Joe Camel
And stick with the liks like a hick in old flannel
The contradiction to turns are y'all niggas spitting a verse?
Is like me smiling while I flip you the bird
I mister disturbed and doctor depression
I got an obsession for seeing police officers stressing
And catching a deep throating actress
Who knows gymnastics and sucks the lubricant off of prophylactics
The facts is, I specialize in crushing brews
I'm Louis Logic nigga, who the fuck are you?

[Verse Three]
I create ????? ????????? of ????? ???????
Something similar to ????? ????????
The faint of heart want to puke on us, my cohorts are so sick
You sold yours sleeping in you ???????? ?????
We throw bricks cause we building, not a lack of skill
Fake cats make a killing in the actor's guild
I got a glass to fill with beer
Sipping while I'm stealing gear whipping a black Cadillac Seville
Niggas asking, "is this cat for real?"
Shit I'm swallowing some Advil pills with a flask that's filled
??? ????? I'm a shoe in, when it comes to spewing confusion
Over-achiever, working on improving my boozing
If you think that that's funny
A drug dealer tried to buy single DAT from me with some crack money
Sonny, my style is new plus improved
Cause I'm Louis Logic, who the fuck are you?</pre>
