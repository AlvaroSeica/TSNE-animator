Jacki-O you can't be playing with that pussy now
Jacki
Lemme lemme lemme see what you working with
I I I know it look real good but
I wanna get real close to it
Poe Boy
I wanna get real close to it  come on

I get diamonds, big old pearls
Brand new cars, cause I got my girl
She my best friend, she keeps it real
I love my pussy, pussy pay my bills
That pussy pussy
That pussy pussy
That pussy pussy
That pussy pussy
It's so pretty, she so sweet (So Sweet)
She so good, wet indeed

[Chorus]
Pussy real good, that pussy real good
Pussy real good, that pussy real good
That pussy off the chain, go on and do yo thang
Pussy real good, that pussy real good

Ya momma don't like me, she say I'm no good
What she don't know is, I got you pussy whooped
He need this pussy, he smell this pussy
He wanna taste this pussy, you gotta pay for pussy
That pussy pussy
That pussy pussy
That pussy pussy
That pussy pussy
Police pull me over, they don't write no tickets'
All between my legs, tryin to eat me

[Chorus]

Girl I don't pay for weed, I get in clubs free
In V.I.P. and we drinking bubbly
It's so fat, to be in G-Strings
And it's so swoll, you can see the print in my jeans
That pussy pussy
That pussy pussy
That pussy pussy
That pussy pussy
Collect calls from jail, he just want some stuff
Tryin to get a bond, he wanna beat it up

[Chorus]

Da the da the da the da the da the daaaaa (x4)

American Pussy, Hatian Pussy
Cuban Pussy, Bahamian Pussy
Puertorican Pussy, Jamaican Pussy
Poe Boy
Girls we got power, cause we got pussies

[Chorus]</pre>
