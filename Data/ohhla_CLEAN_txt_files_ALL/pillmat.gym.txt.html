Album:  The Papercut Chronicles
Song:   Pillmatic
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Chorus]
Pillmatic, three Xanax down
I'm poundin Honey Browns
I'm pillmatic
The Oxycontin got my stomach rotten
Pillmatic, I swear to God I'm not an addict
But I'm still at it, dagnabbit I'm pillmatic

[Verse One]
Thinkin back on when it all started
I found pink hearts in mommy's little pocket book and took 'em
Poppin when she wasn't lookin, I guess it runs in the family
I'm liable to eat any pill you randomly hand me
Save the greenery I'm lookin for them labels
Readin "may cause drowsiness" - "be careful when operating machinery"
Beautiful pharmaceuticals, residue in my cuticles
Sniffin them when it's suitable, wishin they made 'em chewable
Catch me in The Source with five pills next to my name
Like FUCK five mics, I want five Vic' fame
If, killin pain is the name of the game
Then I'm your number one draft pick
Dash quick to the closest medicine cabinet, kill the whole bottle
Never played the role model position, I'm just livin
So take two of these and call me in the mornin
I'ma take four and finish this 40 cause life's borin
And I'm

[Chorus]

[Verse Two]
Keep the hydro unless it's codone behind it
Never have to roam far from home to find it
Writin fake scripts like my doctor signed it
'Til I spelled his last name wrong
This ain't a song for the kids like the last album
Put 'em to bed go ahead and turn the volume/Valium up
A couple meds to ease the pain of the papercuts
The doctor says slow down, maybe later buts
FOrty milligrams, a 40 and I'm faded
This world is crazy so I stay medicated
Percocet, Ativan, and Klonopin
When my social lights are out they turn 'em on again
And I'll eat 'em 'til I'm born again
Oxycontin, orange juice and gin
Equals projectile wild style burner on the porcelain
{*vomiting sounds*}
(Daaaamn you alright?) I'm all good, I'm good

[Chorus]</pre>
