[Chorus: Jay Rock]
Keeping it G ain't nothing
You ain't gotta like it cause the hood gone love it
You ain't gotta like it cause the hood gone love it
Watch a young nigga show his ass out in public
I got the whole block bumping
You ain't gotta like it cause the hood gone love it
You ain't gotta like it cause the hood gone love it
Watch a young nigga show his ass out in public

[Jay Rock]
Na-now-now-now-now-now you know what this is
Tell 'em it's a celebration bitches
with barbecue pits and the mini-bikes
Mini-skirts, Hennessys and the Miller Lites
Domino tables, who got big six?
Where I'm from we do concrete backflips
Flip flop, flip flop, flip flop back
to the ghettos where I bring Hip Hop back
Real niggas love me, they tell me keep it pushing
The only niggas speak from way inside of Central Bookings
County jails and them lock-downs up north
Said I should have it if Scarface passed the torch
That's how they feel Jack, but this more than rap
This that project haircut in a cul-de-sac
This is where Jose front you, them quarters at
Meet your quota whenever I put a quote on a track, nigga

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
From Compton to Baltimore I'ma kill it, I'll buy a morgue in the minute
The public house, the plastic couch of a section 8 tenant
The Regal window is tinted, the air conditioner broke
But I'm cool enough to ensure you my ride is an eskimo, huh?
And I peel off in the midst of getting my thrills off
And I thrive off energy from inner cities that we lost, huh?
I'm putting the ghetto on top of my back
And I live in the back of the jungle, lions, tigers, bears, oh my
Hear the siren, walk up {*gunshots*}, drive-by
Shooters, looters, Federal Fed intruders
Engines on back of scooters, the real can recognize real
and we need to know just who you are, you are in the presence of many presents
Kendrick, the gift for the future, oh yeah I said it
Thug Life, good kid, mad city
Mad respect, representing the Hub right

[Chorus]

[Jay Rock]
The homegirls tell me I'm the shit
I break 'em off so they can buy 'em some outfits
I buy they sons a pack of pampers, some new Jordans
Give 'em the game, school 'em on what's really important
That's how I was raised, the OGs had me
thirteen, fresh off the porch, slanging cabby
But I'm wiser now, showing my young niggas
there's other ways you get them dollars and funds nigga
Coming down in an old school, so cool
Whip like a fireball, call it Goku
You don't know the tribulations that we go through
Put your ears to the speakers, I'ma show you
I paint a picture so perfect
Hear my CD, you see Mona Lisa in person
Courtesy of a hunnit beat
Got my crips and eses at arm reach, one west~!
