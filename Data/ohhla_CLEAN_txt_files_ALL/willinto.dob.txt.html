(Yeah)
(Oh Yeah)
(Oh it's on now fool)
(Just when you that you herd it all, nah this ain't no gang stories)
(This is a story about one of my homies)
(Yeah you know whats up)
(Hey yo Litefoot show them the reel fool)

[Litefoot]
Last night I herd the cops say freeze 
But now a days life on the resay, horses and teepees 
I Never had a good day, its bad enough they took our land, 
now we dealing with this B.I.A. 
But that's an Indians life out in OK, 
I'm sendin' the smoke signals all the way to L.A. 
Put out the peace pipe, put on the war paint 
Put down the bow and arrow now I got an AK 
And then Kid Frost stepped on the plain, 
this Mexican from LA is a little insane (loco) 
Frost My people got a problem, (what's that) 
You see they keeping us down, now do you think that we can solve that?  
(Strong arm straight up, that's the solution, 
 get your self an army and start a revolution)
Pollution, in the sky, makes me cry 
I'm proud to be a Cherokee and willing to die

[Chorus: Frost]
O.G.'s fighting to survive
they bout to recognize that I'm willing to die 
O.G.'s fighting to survive 
they bout to recognize the tribe's willing to die 
(What's up dog)
(You can't hang with this can you?)
(Nah it's too real)

[Litefoot]
Fighting is in my blood, that's just the way that I am 
I'm creeping with the Prophet and my Man Cheyenne 
Circling the reservation like a vulture 
And granddaddy always kept me up on my culture (that's right) 
So I'm proud to be a Cherokee 
And the United States government ain't scaring me 
Back in the days they killed Indians for salaries 
I'm could one time modern day Calvary 
What's gonna happen when we fight back?  
Strap the guns again man they ain't gonna like that 
They gonna have to come and get me 
Black boots and hundreds of troops like 1860 
So listen to the words that I'm writing
If I'm going down, bet your ass I was fighting 
Ask me what I am and I can never deny 
I'm a Indian homeboy and I'm willing to die

Frost Chorus: 1X

(Yeah)
(Are you willing to die?)
(Yeah)
(Are you willing to die?)

[Litefoot]
We the only people in the world without a motherland 
Legally that is but I'll explain it on another chance 
I been American before there was Americans (Americans) 
Back when they to call my people redskins (redskins) 
Have you ever herd of Billy Jack 
Well this is Litefoot Homeboy and I'm a little worst than that
I come equipped with a 30 shot clip
And my tribe got the vibe so they ready to trip 
Somebody gotta take a stance so I'm ah stand up 
Talk about the problem and I'm ah bring the land up 
You took this country and you demented it 
You saw a land that was green and you cemented it 
Machinery replaced all the greenery 
And now you acting like you shouldn't mean a thing to me 
So I'm ah organize and give it one more try 
You see I'm Cherokee and willing to die

Frost Chorus: 1X

(This goes out to every Cheyenne and Apache, 
 Cherokee, Inca, the Maya, Camanche, Navajo, Aztec 
 the people of the sun, run Indian run.)
(This goes out to every Cheyenne and Apache, 
 Cherokee, Inca, the Maya, Camanche, Navajo, Aztec 
 the people of the sun, run Indian run)
(Yeah)
