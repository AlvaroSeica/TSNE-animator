[Shawn Wigs]
You wanna crab half step? Get your fronts pushed back
I'm so tight, when I rhyme, I don't leave no slack
Fully packed, clap back, I'm a needle in a haystack
Jelty, Mighty Healthy, it's so wealthy
I ain't bullshitting, Donald fucking Trump couldn't help me
I Starks Entered the Prise, and blew eighty mill
Flew straight to Iraq for a license to kill
Rocked them kevlaar derby with the tephlon fatigues
Staten Island we all over your Source magazine
How marvelous, press said Wigs is high post
Well connected, been linked to Lord Mike and Ghost
And spotted in the hood from east to west coast
Puffing the Gerder, stomping in the Theodore coat
Park the CLK 500 with no plates
Took a test drive and drove the fuck out of the state
Off dusty, actions speak, my money speaks louder
Come around and get your brain popped like clam chowder</pre>
