Strings is on my fingers
strings is on my legs
I'm a human being but I feel just like a puppet
go 'head...

Without the name of a misfit
fit me into a game full of guilt trips and trip seeing
how I came with a zipped lip with lips speaking
not a thing that I wish just consider me a puppet
stuck with some thread in my butt because I won't get crunk
like the rest of these ducks who got plucked then stuffed
in the public market just to cuff a couple bucks like public parking
interrupt it hardly
hopefully I'm in the mind frame to openly erupt
the evolution of all time claim nothing but the problem
I'm solution to the migraine bumping
'cause it's nothing but the music of a child playing
lyrics from a nursery so tweedily-dum
and I'm suspicious of a person who don't see that it's dumb
I must be crazy with a little too much puff puff passing
'cause I swear I hear the music but see puppets dancing like...

Tell the industry they could kiss my (*) and I don't care
'cause the industry leaves you just like (*) with teary eyes
and underwear down below your (*) don't be surprised
and funny 'cause they don't know your Â– throw your hands in the air
and wave them just like bombs was in the air
and you was scared that they just might drop
and leave you scattered everywhere like a busted condom
while these rappers act as if they came from busted condoms
I don't trust nobody in a world
where the only way you elevate away is if you know somebody
it's like a robot party how these rappers are programmed to make a song
as if they rapping at an after school jam with their wam bam slam jams
thinking their amped and with a slam jam thank you ma'am
making you cramped is every artist with a song g
hostwritten by Forrest Gump but all I do is just give them my chorus
dunt...

Back again but on a whole new level is rap
but ya'll would never know who's better
just snaps in all and every song you fellas make tracks
around but let me told you better
I'm an old school feller so I thought that rap
would bring a whole new era but it brought some crap
I'll let you know that in the long run it can't be me
I rep diplomas while their showing off their ABC's
and if a chicken with his head cut off is crunk
I must be kicking like a missing leg off in the swamp
'cause see these suckas got me utterly disgusted and shamed
to bust and educated verse while they keep spelling their names
and I'm upset with this Atlanta for accepting these
grammar-impairing elementary amateurs you label as rappers
and now if everybody else can copy Barney and make it
I'll put up better competition simply farting and shaking saying...</pre>
