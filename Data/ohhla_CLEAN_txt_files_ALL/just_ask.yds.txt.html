[Intro: Bless]
I can tell just by the way your shaped, that your very sexy girl
(That's for real and I know)
I hope this ain't a very big mistake, that I'm about to ask you girl

[Chorus: Bless]
Is it cool if I just get in touch babe
I promise I'll be good, every minute you let me
Take my time until I make it enough babe, out here rough babe
I'm just asking you

[Young Deuces]
I got a mami that's a rider, keep her engine goin
She purrs when I'm inside her, keep the handcuffs beside her
Shorty so fly she stay dipped, dipped in Prada
And it feels like Nevada cause it's get, getting hotter now
E-Mail the kid when I'm out on tour
Baby girl I ain't fly I soar, I can glide the floor
We stepping out I work it out like a choir
That new whip you ain't finding handles on my door
And ya styles like Mayweather shorty is a knock out
Jeans fittin right I see you had to bring the fox out
Playing your position shorty done a perfect box out
Looking at your body is making my eyes pop out
I had to pull the drop out, talk of the state
Make reservations but we pullin up fashionably late
I move weight so you know I'm as real as can be
Wont you be the point guard on my team and get wit me ma

[Chorus]

[Streetz]
Excuse me miss, can I get your name
Write down your number, I'll do the same
You got a man, how long you had that pain?
I'm willing to bet, I won't do you the same
Grown man B.I.
Why you wanna go and do that like T.I.
I'm the letter after the H, you gone see I
Know how to treat a lady, no If's, And's drop the May be's
Hair in the wind, when I drop the Mercedes
Make your knees buckle, whenever I touch you
I can keep a secret, you ain't gotta tease miss
So bad yet she so sexy
I'm gone do whatever you let me
What is it I got it, you hurtin I spot it
Go ahead and let that lame go
Treat you like usher I'ma show you what it's made for

[Chorus]

[Young Deuces]
Toast of the town its bout to go down
Me and you can have a private party out in my lounge
I don't care about cakin I'm a grown ass man
We can go and get it poppin be apart of my plans
But you gotta be exclusive, I'm seein that you knew this
Don't get to wylin and actin all brand newish
Hey, relax ya mind let ya conscious be free
You know rollin wit ya boy from the E-M-P, Ya Heard

[Streetz]
Ma come closer you know I ball
We can live in the sky like we 9 feet tall
Awe, I'm so caught up
If it came down to it I'll give it all up
Baby would you mind if I ask some questions
If looks can kill she'll be a smithn-Wesson
Now, lay my game down, Tell me how you like it
Every king need a queen you can be my side kick

[Bless]
I can tell just by the way your shaped, that your very sexy girl
(That's for real and I know)
I hope this ain't a very big mistake, that I'm about to ask you girl
Is it cool if I just get in touch babe
I promise I'll be good, every minute you let me
Take my time until I make it enough babe, out here rough babe
I'm just asking you</pre>
