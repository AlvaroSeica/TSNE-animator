Song:   The Rose and the Thistle
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus: Mackenzie Gault]
The rose and the thistle, well they both have thorns
They both have thorns, they both have thorns
The rose and the thistle, well they both have thorns
And they grow in the garden where your love was born
The rose and the thistle, well they both have thorns
They both have thorns, they both have thorns
The rose and the thistle, well they both have thorns
And they grow in the garden where your love was born

[Verse 1: Brer Rabbit]
I'm between a rock and a hard place
Your thought and your heart's space
Meant no for nothing, like a pick in an empty guitar case
Follow you like a car chase
To the part where we stargaze the plot in your garden
I see your world view like Marvin the Martian
Your part of the solution's, my part of the problem
If you stop to smell the roses I know we can solve them
As the world keeps revolving, let's keep on evolving
A natural selection like Wallace and Darwin
Grow grey like Steve Martin, in old age be radiocarbon
Getting to half our lives together, when the great part gets started
To keep it short I'm glad you were born, let's keep flowing together through thistle and thorn

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Johnny 5]
The Rose and the thistle, they both have thorns
Took note of this when I woke this morn'
Sun rise came in as one bright ray and the place on the wall where it shone was warm
And the shadow cast was like a battleaxe so I grabbed it fast and I smashed the glass
And I crawled through the shards and I found myself in a beautiful garden
With petals, bulbs, nettles, mulch, hibiscus, delphinidins, ferns, christmas bells, geraniums
Jack in the pulpit, baby's breath, lily of the Nile, a star of Bethlehem
A brilliant child being poked at and scorned, the rose and the thistle they both have thorns

[Brer Rabbit]
Hey Mary, begging your pardon, what pretty flowers grow in your garden?
Let's lie back, in the lilacs, meander in the lavender
Get silly in the lilies, dancing under oleanders
Holy molly holding hands, snap dragon tantrums
And open up the irises, humming summer anthems
He loves me not will forget me not, looking for the answers
He loves me not will forget me not, looking for the answers

[Chorus]</pre>
