Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Hopsin]
Yo, I work hard and barely get paid
How did I get stuck on this page
I've been starvin for like six days
I should go and get a switch blade
And try to find out where this bitch stays
I'm a lit flame, what's your future I predict pain
Slit veins, squished brains I'm just saying
Locked in the basement causes madness and errors
All I have to talk to is the fuckin man in the mirror
But you never saw it from my perspective
The craft that I perfected got rejected
And thrown out the window with no proper exit
I was humble, now I'm not as pleasant
I'm droppin wreckage on your shady dynasty, bitch I'm not to mess with
You made me think it was impossible that I could blow
and get a little money from sellin records for coppin clothes
Let's talk about the 42 records that Hopsin sold
You sleepin on a fuckin pot of gold, so listen close

[Chorus]
Don't you ever call me again
I'm not your buddy
I'm not your pal
Right here is where it ends, ends, ends, sorry for you
I'm not your buddy
I'm not your pal
You are my enemy

[Hopsin]
Yo, since when are buddies posed to be so mean
They must be hatin the air that we both breathe
Shit we used to be tighter than emo jeans
The day I boss, stand back and watched the c-notes gleam
I know you see me blowin up, growin up it disturbs you
When my words move fanatics
and in return you gotta post little blogs on the internet
Talkin bout I've been erect, my career is wack I'll never benefit
I hope you die a bitter death
Then lie in a graveyard in regret
Where all of the foul niggaz rest
You hatin cause you witnessin the best
So just confess
You shattered our friendship and you can't fix the mess
I'm not a bit impressed by nothin you've done
My name's stuck on your tongue
Motherfucker you sprung
Give it up move on
You've taken this shit too far
You mad cause you unsatisfied with who you are bitch

[Chorus]
Don't you ever call me again
I'm not your buddy
I'm not your pal
Right here is where it ends, ends, ends, sorry for you
I'm not your buddy
I'm not your pal
You are my enemy

[Hopsin]
You were the love I used to see in my dreams
But when we met how come shit can never be what it seem
I was pleased with the things we did together, it's like we was a team
But you would change when I flee from the scene
Around me you were pure hearted, lovin and caring
And when we hun out you'd even brighten up your appearance
You fooled me like you were smart, cute and somethin to stare
But you was frontin little bitch, now I'm strugglin to bare it
Because you were the opposite of what you told me you don't do
Drugs, one night stands and you know that it's so true
You saw my heart exposed, grabbed a hold and then broke through
Hoes are just so rude, fuckin bogus and cold to
Oh but there's no dude you would let interfere
With our love, that's the exact shit you said in my ear
When you arrived in my world, I thought heaven was near
But time made it very clear that the devil was here
So fuck you

[Chorus]
Don't you ever call me again
I'm not your buddy
I'm not your pal
Right here is where it ends, ends, ends, sorry for you
I'm not your buddy
I'm not your pal
You are my enemy</pre>
