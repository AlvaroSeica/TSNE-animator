[Iriscience]
See I think a wack rapper needs to catch service
I think a wack DJ needs to be nervous

[Iriscience]
Yo my DJ's so nice he don't slice he severs
(Evidence: Bab's, forgive 'em)
{*DJ Babu scratchs "never"*}

[Iriscience]
See I think a wack rapper needs to catch service
I think a wack DJ needs to be nervous

[Iriscience]
Payin good money, the fans don't deserve this
Choppin up your skills, your potential is worthless

[Evidence]
I go to...any extreme for you to hear it
I find my best quotes make bumper stickers with our lyrics
Sell my slogan, boom box and spill my toxic vibrations
And echos...of metro...stations
I've placed in flow enhancements
Tomorrow your big parade, tonight we're rain dancin
My DJ's on the cut, my DJ made a beat
My DJ's name is Babu, don't provoke in self defeat

[Iriscience]
Yo I remember the days, these cats battled for fame
For equipment and paint, for the honor and name
But since me and hip hop is just one and the same
I be huggin the track
(Evidence: But who's conducting the train?)
*BABU*
His style's serrated to rip wax
It's a fact this cat's more felt than slip mats
Swinging the axe, choppin down the best acts
1200 Technics, the Shure's and Vestax
05 Pro, world wide then live show
Dilated Junkie makes the rookies drive slow
The stage prop DJ has run outa luck
Super Duper Duck Breaks, no fuckit just (duck?)

[Iriscience]
See I think a wack rapper needs to catch service
I think a wack DJ needs to be nervous

[Evidence]
Yo my DJ's so nice he don't slice he severs
(Evidence: Bab's, forgiv 'em)
{*DJ Babu scratchs "never"*}

[Iriscience]
See I think a wack rapper needs to catch service
I think a wack DJ needs to be nervous

Payin good money, the fans don't deserve this
Choppin up your skills, your potential is worthless

{*DJ Babu scratches*}

[Iriscience]
Babu, drop the obelisk on this

{*DJ Babu scratches "checkitout" *}

"DJ Babu, Beat Junkies, Dilated Peoples..."
