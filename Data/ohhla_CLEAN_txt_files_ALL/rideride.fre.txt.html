[Intro: Free Murda]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
My niggas ride, ride, ride, ride
Me and my niggas ride, ride, ride, ride
Me and my niggas ride, yeah, be a homicide
On your side, you can die, die, die

[Free Murda]
I'm a gangsta, never talk them hoes
Free gangsta, leave no info
Pop watts, while your fifth blow
How you gon' show me, what your clip gon' hold?
Least forty shots, I got the forty cocked, big gun, right through your window
Passing the door, watch your clip fold
I'm passing the raw, now my wrist grow
Off flips like gymnastics, when the NARCs come, don't know the answer
Still coming off with the four-matic
Disrespect and that's a closed casket
Don't know til I blow ratchet, boy, buzz all four, and we can go at it
Don't know hoes but the cold bastards
And you think with your dick, now your foe's laughing
Got the four blasting, nigga, hold that shit
Better run when I unload that clip
Nigga pull the gun with no action, leave his ass done with a whole rap bit
Sound of a donut, better high when I roll up
Bought mad singles but I ride like a soldier
Like I told ya, I disown ya, fuck with me and you'll lie in a coma
Should of stuck with me, right behind that toasted, when I fired from close-up
What's the hold up, when I post up, my doulja do like she suppose to

[Chorus: Free Murda]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Me and my niggas, ride, ride, ride, ride
Me and my niggas, ride, ride, ride, ride
Me and my niggas, ride, better run, better hide
Me and my niggas, ride, ride, ride, ride
Me and my niggas, ride, ride, ride, ride
Me and my niggas, ride, the'll be a homicide
On your side, you can die, die, die, die

[Free Murda]
Who that wanna fuck with me, Lil' Free
Now ya'll get smoked like angel dust
No clips wanna bang with us
Might wanna sing with us, ya'll can't be dangerous
Got feds wanna bang us, got niggas in the P's wanna hate us
Got chicks atleast wanna date us, nah we straight ball like the Raiders
Ya'll fools better slow down, better fall back, fall, make the outwards whole round
Put a ghost in your town, Free Murda, on your spell, put you in low ground
Ya'll niggas ain't harming me, and I leave these boys wet like laundry
Loose lips, chase hips, out to sold quick, but you walk quick
And it's funny like comedy, it's arming me
Now set cuz I shoot, til my armor sees, and pat on your arteries
That smoke make it hard to breath, fog in the air, you can hardly see
Get ate like God Degree, yeah, me and my niggas ride, kick that gun right off your side
You catch one when you walk the side, I don't care nothing, cuz I walk without mine
I ain't stupid, knock a nigga ass out with two hits
Leave you toothless, think you ruthless
We can do this, but the movement

[Chorus]

[Free Murda]
Muthafuckas ain't playing with the chopper
Undercovers with the K, got blocka
Nigga, blocka, blocka, all day and it ain't gonna stoppa
Act like you ain't afraid of the mobsters, swim with the fish, get ate by the lobsters
In school, cuz I ate in the locker, what's cool, better bang that llama
Use a fool if you think that I'mma, faggot nigga
I had it, nigga, up to here, you disappear, without magic nigga
Shit, yeah, see it clear, without glasses nigga
Sit here, in a chair, grab that plastic, nigga
Put it right on your face, now that's a classic, nigga
Can't talk, can't breathe, should of brought that heat
Middleside of the four day suites, six/seven on the court with the E
That's eight a sword, they can't bang us all
Police, can't walk on beats, strip they ass so they walk on feet
Hit the gas, tryin' to bark on me
Them niggas can't talk to Free, stick the gas with the hawk in his sleeve

[Chorus]</pre>
