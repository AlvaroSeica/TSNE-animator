Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Ye, ye, ye, ye, yea
Woo, let's go!

Come my lady
Come come my lady
I am the [?]
You can't trade me
Hate me or love me I spit greatly
Fuckin up the track
My town is crazy

I'll be back on the beat
Back like the red seat
Reclined and now I'm puttin up my feet
Heat
Is what I produce like rub and flint
Punches gottcha seeing two like double mint

I'm just trying to cop a dub
And split a dutch open
Fill it with that Mary Jane
And start smokin'
Rollin' that shit up and get blasted
Smellin' so good in a bag
It's orgasmic

Drop rhythms
Pop pills till I'm trippin'
So high that my feet are liften off the ground like a magician
Since I started flippin'
I just never stopped spittin'
Now I am a brain surgeon on these pediatricians

Stay whippin', 2 blunts down
And stay twistin'
Keep my people closer than fingers in a mitten
Verbal ammunition and you know I'm never missin'
More fly than, Dancer, Cupid, Donnor and Blitzin

I am Christian
Last name is Webster
Tear down the rap game
Insane and clever
Buzzed off the cocaine
Untamed as ever
Come down harder than rain
Spit flames for pleasure

The X I got won't find you treasure
It'll leave you rollin so hard
You'll leave in a stretcher
Better than all these clowns
Shit I'm blastin off
I am the next, better Asher Roth

With an unheard flow
I'm original
CT Criminal
Any opposition?
Minimal
Get up in your face
Not a message is subliminal
Battle with me
Is simply not winnable

I am the pinical of white raps
Since I started to write tracks
Blowing up knuckles
And fight back
I like that
I might blast off to the moon
Smokin piff for a night
Capped off dogs, so light that

Puff puff pass till you fall on your ass
Quicker than silver
And more fast than the flash
I'm a go kill em with my flow
While their ready to go

So bro, you know you can't rap with me
Your about as hard as a virgin dackquory
Spit some shit
Swear to god I was black, yah see
But I'm a white boy outta the academy

I master beats
Who could spit it after me
So if your looking for the best bitch
Ask for me
I'm a youngster
The next rap from the rug like bow wow
If he was white and on drugs

And if his tracks didn't suck
But they does
So I'm a be a whole lot better than he was
I'm buzzed
You'll now that hes bad
Like Amy Winehouse before the rehab

Poppin' 3 tabs
I'm made like (dog jeckle?)
Bump up the base line
And you know I rock treble
Number one hip hop rebel
You know what I meant
Illest MC of European decent

Holla, I'm Nice, I'm Nice, oh, whoa whoa, let's go</pre>
