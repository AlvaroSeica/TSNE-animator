[Spoken Word]
This is Big Snap representing The Brotherhood
O.T.S. Holding that 7 sign high
Freemasons alike, we all in the same struggle
The key is to come together for a common purpose
That purpose is to teach the lil' homies how to live life
If we all come together The Brotherhood will survive
Keep ya head up, Tupac, we miss you

[Verse 1]
Eluding the cops by all means, triple 6, glocks, buckles and beams
I take the brotherhood to heart with me
I take the 7 sign, hold it high, represent pride
And do what I got to do to survive, it's do or die
In this lifetime times get rough and I get tough
As if the drama in this life just wasn't enough
And I'll never devulge the secrets that I've been taught
About the struggle that me and my people have all fought
Like Tupac, you was a genius, a lyrical man
Hold the 7 up high and always think of homeland
And I'll await the year 2003 and then we will see
'Till then homie, I'mma keep it all in me
They'll never figure nothing out until the message is out
But the shadow is over my soul and it'll never come out
And there's one thing y'all gotta realize while hearing this
The S.U Brotherhood, homie, is planning some hits
And when I die I hope to reincarnate and become a teacher
Exit Big Snap, enter Paco The Preacher

[Chorus]
The Brotherhood is taking over, the end gets closer
Don't try to challenge me or my crew, because we doper
We settin' up shop in your town, your goin'g down
We sparing no expense on your life, we finna clown

[Verse 2]
The misson at hand, is for the Brotherhood to make a big stand
And Freemasons alike, you come along because we are fam
And I am the man, Big Snap from UGF clan
And I represent Cali 'cause it is the homeland
And I have a plan to rid the world of alien men
peeps that shouldn't be here, you'll die before you count to 10
I escape the world through the Underground Railroad
And leave clues as to where I am at but do not rat
I'll be back, let my legacy live, if you my nig
'Cause if you let it out, I'll fa sho pull the trig
Now lets ammo up and hit the spot, but don't drop
The Brotherhood is a shadow, invisible to cops
Don't talk biz on the phone because it might be tapped
And if you say the wrong words then we might get trapped
We come swift and unnoticed and that is a fact
And if you ain't with this lifestyle, you better adapt

[Chorus]
The Brotherhood is taking over, the end gets closer
Don't try to challenge me or my crew, because we doper
We settin' up shop in your town, you going down
We sparing no expense on your life, we finna clown

[Verse 3]
Keep the lessons that you've learned deep in your soul
Don't give us up to the foes or them crooked po-po's
And if you want to learn more cuz, then look up to me
And on the Mason sign, you'll learn the true meaning of the "G"
I'm a preacher 'cause of the words that I speak, I like to preach
I like to see reactions from the souls that I've reached
Don't even come at me with lies, 'cause I ain't got the time
I might not be too old but I've entered my prime
The Brotherhood moves swift and unnoticed, don't try to focus
Now you see us now you don't, this ain't no hocus pocus
Me, Oath, OutSpoken and D hittin' y'all hard with something proper
My homies Cyco and GK are ready to drop ya
Don't stress if I wear a Blue Rag in a Red Rag's hood
Just know that if you step to us, it won't all be good</pre>
