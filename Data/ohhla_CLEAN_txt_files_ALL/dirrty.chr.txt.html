[Intro: Redman]
UH, dirrty, filthy, nasty
Christina you nasty (Yeah)
Too dirty to clean my act up
If you ain't dirty, you ain't here to party
Whoo, ladies move, gentleman move
Somebody ring the alarm, a fire in the room
Ring the alarm, and I'm trowin' elbows
Ring the alarm, and I'm trowin' elbows
Ring the alarm, and I'm trowin' elbows
Where my dawgs at?

[Verse 1: Christina]
Uh, let me loose
Oooh, I'm overdue, gimmie some room, comin' through
Paid my dues, I'm in the mood
Me and my girls come to shake the room
DJ spinnin', show your hands
Let's get dirrty, that's my jam
I need that, uh to get me off
Sweatin' till my clothes come off

It's explosive, speakers are thumpin'
Still jumpin', six in the mornin'
Table dancin', glasses are crashin'
No question, time for some action
Temperature's up (Can you feel it), 'bout to erupt
Gonna get my girls, get your boys, gonna make some noise

[Chorus: Christina]
Gonnna get rowdy, gonna get a little unruly
Get it fired up in a hurry
Wanna get dirrty, it's about time that I came to start the 
Party, sweat drippin' over my body
Dancin', gettin' just a little naughty
Wanna get dirrty, it's about time for my arrival

[Verse 2: Christina]
Ah, heat is up, ladies, fellas drop your cups
Bodies packed, front to back, move your ass, I like that
Tight hip huggers, low for ho
Shake a little somethin', on the floor
I need that uh to get me off
Sweatin' till my clothes come off

Let's get open, cause a commotion
Still goin', eight in the mornin'
There's no stoppin', we keep it poppin'
Hard rockin', everyone's talkin'
Give all you got (Give it to me), just hit the spot
Gonna get my girls, get your boys, gonna make some noise

[Chorus: Christina]
Gonnna get rowdy, gonna get a little unruly
Get it fired up in a hurry
Wanna get dirrty, it's about time that I came to start the 
Party, sweat drippin' over my body
Dancin', gettin' just a little naughty
Wanna get dirrty, it's about time for my arrival

[Breakdown: Christina]
Here it comes it's the one you been wait'n on
Get up get it rough, yup that's what's up
Givin' just what you love to the maximum
Uh-oh (Uh-oh) Here we go (Here we go)
What to do when the music starts to drop
That's when we take it to the parkin' lot
And I bet you somebody's gonna call the cops
Uh-oh (Uh-oh) Here we go (Here we go)

[Verse 3: Redman]
Yo, hot damn, Doc a Jam like a Summer Show
I keep my car looking like a crash dummy drove
My gear look like the bank got my money froze
For dead presidents I pimp like Huddy roll
Doc the one that excite ya divas (ow!)
If the media shine, I'm shining with both of the sleeves up
Yo Christina (what), better hop in here
My block live and in color, like Rodman hair (yeah)
The club is packed, the bar is filled
I'm waiting for sister to act, like Lauryn Hill
Frankly, it's a rap, no bargain deals
I drive a four wheel ride with foreign wheels
Throw it up baby it's Brick City, you heard of that
We blessed, and hung low, like Bernie Mac (Bernie Mac)
Dogs, let 'em out, women, let 'em in
It's like I'm ODB, the way I'm freaking

[Chorus: Christina]
Gonnna get rowdy, gonna get a little unruly
Get it fired up in a hurry
Wanna get dirrty, it's about time that I came to start the 
Party, sweat drippin' over my body
Dancin', gettin' just a little naughty
Wanna get dirrty, it's about time for my arrival

Gonnna get rowdy, gonna get a little unruly
Get it fired up in a hurry
Wanna get dirrty, it's about time that I came to start the 
Party, sweat drippin' over my body
Dancin', gettin' just a little naughty
Wanna get dirrty, it's about time for my arrival

UH WHAT
