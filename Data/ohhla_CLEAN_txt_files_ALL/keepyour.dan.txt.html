[Verse 1: Danny!]
Nice girl, the type to wife up
A queen with a smile that could light the night up
Her dreams are a mile high cream-colored pile
She ain't sing in a while but ignites the mic, yup
She really wanted to pursue a deal
So that her dreams'll come true for real, self-esteem low
Her momma told her she's fat, the hell does she know?
Nobody told her that the haters smell defeat yo
To hear her tell it helpin' someone else's dreams though
Is more fulfilling, what she feelin' inside
Is pretty obvious to everyone, she's livin' a lie
But she don't possess the confidence to give it a try
You would figure her fam would be her biggest fans
But all they do is insult her and make her quit her plans
They tell her "channel that energy try to get a man"
So she don't give a damn
Throw herself into chores
Forever moppin' the floors, until it's spick-and-span
How many times you gon' mop that? ...stop that
God has better things in store and it's not that

[Verse 1: Collette]
When in the midst of sorrow
You can't see up when looking down
A brighter day tomorrow will bring
You hear the voice of reason
Telling you this can't never be done
No matter how hard reality seems
You just hold on to your dreams

[Bridge: Collette]
Don't give up and don't give in
Although it seems you never win
You will always pass the test

[Chorus: Collette]
As long as you keep your head to the sky
You can win as long as you keep your head to the sky
You can win as long as you keep your head to the sky
Be optimistic

[Verse 2: Danny!]
Two kids, Ahmad and Winston
Their pops not around so the odds against 'em
Their mom workin' three jobs, never stay at home
And the younger brother feelin' maybe God resents 'em
Girls like the way he makes 'em feel
But with a pen he's a pimp for real, no opportunties
Bitter brother, always sayin' "poppa ruined me"
Never got a phone call, never got annuity
Never got a postcard, so that gave him
Every reason not to try so hard, he's an ill writer
Still tighter than the kids in his class
He'd rather sit on his ass cause he don't feel as hyper
As everybody steady tellin' him to get away
Send out some resumes, all he ever says is "hey,
Listen, you guys are buggin' out, while y'all care so much?"
It was easier for him to use his dad as a crutch
Nowadays, you can find him smokin' grass from a dutch
How many times is you gonna get high man?
God has bigger plans but you gotta just try man

[Verse 2: Collette]
If things around you crumble
No you don't have to stumble and fall
Keep pushing on and don't you look back
I know the storms and strife
Cloud up your outlook on life
Just look ahead and you'll be inspired
To reach higher and higher

[Bridge: Collette]
You will always do your best
If you learn to never say never
You maybe down but never out
(See that's what optimism does)
Don't give up and don't give in
Although it seems you never win
You will always pass the test

[Chorus] - 2X</pre>
