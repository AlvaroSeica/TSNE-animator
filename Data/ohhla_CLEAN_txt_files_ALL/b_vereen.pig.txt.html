[Intro]
Here's a little story that must be told
Hey, what's going on? Can I talk to you?
Can I talk to you? Oh you need to sit down?
Oh..

[Pigeon John]
I fall in love too easily
I think I fall in love way too fast
I shoulda took a little more time
to really recognize your ugly-ass
When we first went out, I thought you was the bomb
You was kickin all this knowledge on the echos of stuff
You was smart, had intelligence and a bomb booty
Told you how I felt and you start to act snoody
Why'd you have to go and date all my friends?
Talk about you when I go and kick it with them
You spoiled everything, made me cold to the soul
I really think I loved you, let the story be told
 
[Chorus]
Girl I hate you, so much
I wish you were never born
Silly girl, you broke me
My heart's all ripped and torn

{"Hey!" chants}

[Pigeon John]
I want a girl that likes to read in the bed
and likes to watch TV drinkin coffee in the spread
Yeah, that's my type of girl fa sho'
Huh, I don't wanna chase you no mo'
You a mean little woman but yo sho' is fine
The type of girl that makes a brother lose his mind
Give away all his money, tryin to taste a little honey
And you know what you're doin, girl this stuff ain't funny
Everytime you laugh it's like a knife in my heart
You question these dudes' girls right from the start
Heh, you gon' make me date a FUGLY girl
But she know how to cook, make me rule the world

[Chorus]

[Interlude]
Yeah.. Yes you
Guys! (HUH?) GET OVER HERE! {*guys groans*}
Sing.

[Outro]
Why you gotta be so low?
Why you gotta act so mean?
You're such a pretty girl on the outside
But your inside's Ben Vereen 
Why you gotta be so low?
Why you gotta act so mean?
You're such a pretty girl on the outside
But your inside's Ben Vereen 
Why you gotta be so low?
Why you gotta act so mean?
You're such a fine girl on the outside
But your inside's a ugly scene
Why you gotta be so low?
Why you gotta act so mean?
You're such a pretty girl on the outside
But your inside's a (black demon that ain't free)</pre>
