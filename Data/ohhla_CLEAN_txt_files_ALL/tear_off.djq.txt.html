[DJ Quik]
Aw yeah, check this out
The Quiksta is here, yo Spin let me state this
With the hype and style the that I make this
Groove so hot that you would think that I bake this
This is a steak I'ma tiger-try and take this
I come off strong with the strength of a dozer
You have no game with your girl cus I chose her
I grabbed her hand; I took her backstage with me
We tore it off my friend, now she's yours again
I'm like the Big Bad Wolf on the microphone
So if your girl's Little Red you better take her home
And hide her, before I try to ease on up
To push up on the butt
Cus a brother like the Quik is chillin with a feelin
For a fly female because I'm able an willin
To tell her the things that make her hot like a cup of tea
After the show she'll be looking for me
To tear it off... 

Tear it off! Tear it off! C'mon!
Tear it off! Tear it off! C'mon!
Tear it off! Tear it off! C'mon!
Tear it off! Tear it off! C'mon! (C'mon! Cmon!)
Tear it off! Tear it off! C'mon!
Tear it off! Tear it off! C'mon!(Word)
Tear it off! Tear it off! C'mon!(Yo, yo Spin)
Tear it off! Tear it off! C'mon!(Yo drop it)

Getting busy on dope, could swear up and down then I sold it
Girls on the tip so I hold it
A masterpiece, and a piece I'ma get
From the get go I'm gonna go to the mic sweat
And heaven knows, anything goes
With those that dispose no Gucci at our hoes
For the AMG and while your playin me
I'ma flex the hip hop sex and then I'll be
Nice and smooth and mellow and hell of a fellow
?? you can't get with this
I'm a hip with this
Do that dance I'ma ring while you swing to this
And you thought I was only a pimp, how you figure though?
I'll make it good to your girl cus a niggaro
Is givin you something with heart and not soul
Yeah, tear it off

Tear it off! Tear it off! C'mon!
Tear it off! Tear it off! C'mon! (Aw Yeah)
Tear it off! Tear it off! C'mon!
Tear it off! Tear it off! C'mon!
Tear it off! Tear it off! C'mon! (Yo baby)
Tear it off! Tear it off! C'mon! (DJ Quik and Spin)
Tear it off! Tear it off! C'mon! (And we in here you know it)
Tear it off! Tear it off! C'mon! (We got Trace on the board)
(Yo Trace, drop that shit)

[AMG]
I wouldn't stop for a million bucks
Money, Quik cuts, The Source with a house to Â‘ford
And I'll bet the set will be in E-F-F-E-C-T
I'll be arranged to change so I can talk to you
On stage the world the girls the date, but I aint fazed
I play the role and I get praised
Freak and the funk and yo, watch a brother hustle right
On the road with rhythm and chorus, mic
Cus what I'm sayin, "There aint no brother like me"
To step into the AM cus the AM be the G
And girlies on the tip, but they really on the D
And Quik is on the mix, but if he aint he on a freak
Take it off baby, cus today you're gettin done
You never let me see you swim, but let me see you cum
So I can make it good to ya
You know I wanna do ya (Word)
Tear it off... 

Tear it off! Tear it off! C'mon!
Tear it off! Tear it off! C'mon!
