Yo' niggaz know when that White hit, I show no mercy
And I ain't Jesus but I'll bless you with that Hershey
It's some hot ones, we don't just got guns, we pop guns!
They know they zippin' yo' body up when the cops come
If the blood don't speak in the streets, the shots will
And if this rap don't save me from the game, my death will!
