[Big K.R.I.T.]
Hey hey now... 
'ey man, as always, good to see you.. 
Good to see you, my brother 
Good to see alla y'all.. 
Yeah, I called this meeting today to um, discuss a matter at hand
There's a movement we got goin on
I know a lot of y'all may have heard of it, called the R4
or "Return of 4Eva" and uhhhh.. 
Y'know, it's-it's-it's not easy to talk about, if you can dig it, but... 
If you just check, you might catch my drift
It's when the lights get dim and the people get quiet
Whylin, waitin on change (Y'all ready to see Big K.R.I.T.??)
People standin in line for hours at a time {*crowd cheers*}
just to see you hit the stage
You got a feelin that you never really felt befo', deep down in ya gut 
That's when the DJ hit the replay in the track, just to make 'em turn it up 
(Comin to you live from the muddy waters of Mississippi..)
Now the crowd starts chantin err'body frantic, ya know that you runnin behind
The promotor sold way too many tickets for the venue (Give it up!) 
He might just shut it down (for Big, K.R.I.T.~!)
So they so they rush backstage like you gotta go on 
and you gotta go right now
And you pass yo' drank to the broad with the dank 
like, "Baby girl, hold that down"
Then they hand you a mic that's all you need 
Peek out the curtain and all you see
Wave of people, screamin, eager 
to tell them a story that'll set them free
Let them be, a new generation of rebels...
and that there my friend, is how you begin, the Return of 4Eva
 
{*music stops and alarm clock buzzes*}
 
{*man runs up stairs and pounds on the door aggresively*}
 
"Aiyyo, K.R.I.T.! Ay cuh!
 Man cut that FUCKIN alarm off, dawg!
 It's too FUCKIN early in the morning for that shit!
 Yo get up! {*alarm stops*} Goddamn!"</pre>
