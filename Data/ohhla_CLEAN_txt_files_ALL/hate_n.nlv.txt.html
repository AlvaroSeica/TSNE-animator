Chorus: {Tec-9}

Why is everybody player hate'n me
I guess it cuz, I''m ballin' in that U.P.T.
It's the incredible, un-takeable T-E-C and
A lot of you nigga's wanna be like me
Why is everybody player hate'n me
I guess it cuz, I''m ballin' in that U.P.T.
It's the incredible, un-takeable T-E-C and
A lot of you nigga's wanna be like me

Verse One: {Tec-9}

I be the rock-rowler nigga you be the puppy
Hittin' at'cha, spittin' at'cha nigga
You better not let me catch'cha
Now who slipped and left the fuckin' gate's open
I'm on the outside waitin' scopin' out opportunity's
To make a motherfuckin' million is this industry and
I know you recognize I'm threatin' to shut 'em down
Strike 'em down like lightin' it's quite excitin'
To be the player that I be once again call me
The capital T-E-C pimpin' hoes tighter then a nigga
Rollin' Opitomes, so won't ya holla if ya see me nigga
Don't knock me, just watch me, as I rise to the top
Black Connection nigga, and I be slangin' all night
Sleepin' all day, can't figure out how I turned out that way
I hang around slanger's gang banger's rapper's and kidnapper's
Now why is everybody playa hate'n me
Ski mask's passin' me by so why should I try
If I'm not strapped with my automatic AK
Anyway, I'm a spray when I hit the corner

Chorus

Verse Two: {Tec-9}

Got four across the top, nigga all gold's
Ya see, bitches come a fuckin' dime a dozen
They see me chillin' with the wife, and
Start the trouble, but on the double
I'll bust a bubble, break a neck, chin check
To get respect, like that y'all
Yeah, I'm rollin' by kind of high in a
Candy Shaw, got connects with the mob
Bill's payed up front, Black Connection's
Givin' a party you got's to bring yo own blunt
I wonder if I'm a last to the end of time
Or will my face end up on tee shirt's
My family cryin' with all this playa hate'n goin'
On in this world today, who's real who's not
Nobody's safe to say, I see some nigga's
Who claim to be down, but ain't really down
Cuz when you down, them motherfucker's stop comin' around
So I'm a stick to the G-Code, 
don't change the nigga's that you came up with
Them the real nigga's, 
the bigger nigga's that you hang with and slang with
Try'na find a way to come up on a few key's
Try'na find a way to come up on a few gee's

Chorus: {Tec-9}

Why is everybody player hate'n me
I guess it cuz, I''m ballin' in that U.P.T.
It's the incredible, un-takeable T-E-C and
A lot of you nigga's wanna be like me

Verse Three: {Tec-9}

Got a back yard full of nigga's screamin'
Let me go, but I don't think so
Because you know I'm the bounty hunter, 
Bounty Hunter comin' to get'cha, 
The shit that I be carryin' straight up split'cha
I propolize the situation keep on thuggin'
Tellin' me you think I'm all that, but I'm just hustlin'
Comin' up in the game, steady fillin' up my cocaine
I fuck with real nigga's we live, you die
I often dream of straight makin' it
You got's to be about them dollar's ain't no fakin' it
Break out the bacon soda, break out the cola
Whip it for a hour, bring it back like a boulder
It's time for distribution, fuckin' confusion
Closin' my competition shop down
Yo look for me, or you get struck down
Ain't no goin' down my attitude is straight rude
When I was lookin' out for us, you was lookin' out for you
My enemies are around me, and in my face
They got my crossed out and locked down in that place
But I'll be back and down for an 187, it get's the job done
Because I brought my Mock-11, fully automatic
Prepare to handle static, rat-a-tatta
Won't y'all look at all these nigga's scatter
Before I let the bullet's go, I watch the nigga break
To his knee's and cry just like a hoe
{Bitch ass nigga}

Chorus

{Tec-9 Talkin'}

Spit my rhymes all around and y'all sang my shit
Say Yella, them fool's wasn't ready for that huh
Yeah, cuz I'm ballin' in that U.P.T.
Ride out with that shit
It's the incredible, un-takeable T-E-C and
A lot of you nigga's wanna be like me
Spit my rhymes all around and y'all sang my shit
Spit my rhymes all around and y'all sang my shit
Switch my rhymes all around and say that shit
Now why is everybody playa hate'n me
I guess it cuz I'm ballin' in that U.P.T.
It's the incredible, un-takeable T-E-C and
A lot of you nigga's wanna be like me
Why's everybody playa hate'n me</pre>
