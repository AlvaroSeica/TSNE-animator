Hello my children, hahahaha, gather 'round
I got somethin' that I wanna say to you
I think it's about time we over come these fucked up rules
And make the real hell on Earth, hahaha
So listen up, get any motherfucker that you can
And bring him back, haha, yeah

[Mr. Shadow]
If your ass wants to live another day
Get the fuck out of my way when I lyricly slay
Bring it on all my foes
Mr. Shadow be the one that be killing mothafuckas
Like told shove em all in holes
Like a ghost i'ma hauncha mothafuckas make the stories tie
I can hear the cries I can hear when you bring it with more jealousy
I give a bullet and begin to do the fool like I do that vatos mine
To the night with a sight when
I look the moon is full and get tool and look for my foe
Got that five footed star on my chest so you know what I'm looking for
Murder you heard of me makin it dark like an eclips
Like "Tales From the Crypt" I come equipped with the triple six
And I'm bound to get sick
It's The evilest lyricist bringing this wickedness nemisis
Giant on my premisis withnessin part like the Exorcist
Cause I'm comin to get em like every day
You run and you can hide but you won't get away
It's the game that I play like the Ouija board
You can't see me but you will believe me, and need me
If you look a little closer you can see The Shadow of a demon appearin
I'm hearing the voices that tell me to do the evil shit that I do
And you know that I'm due so I do when I cast my spell on you
The evilness just fell on you and I'm the perfect fool to wish HELL ON YOU

[Demon Voices]
Tonight, 781 to your area
You know it's gonna happen tonight
But of course, 781 to your area

[Lil'' Rob]
Creepin up on your ass you won't even see or hear me coming
Be running I'm becoming some thing evil fuck people fuck sequals
Got to get the murder done now, all I see is the fear in your eyes
The tear in your eyes, you're terrorized
Don't be surprised, I see my reflection like a mirror in your eyes
Every thing gots a price, but you got a price to pay
I sold your life away, and so I slice away
Dealin with your life I took your strap, your price is right
Could tonight be the night that I feel some thing come over me
I don't know what it is with a devilish grin
Foes and friend and bloody sin
Don't know when it's gonna end
Just like a puppet on a string he be controlin me
I try to be cutting those string but like smokey he gots a hold on me

[Devil's Voice]
Thats the fool that rolled on you
Thats the fool that stoled on you
What the fuck you gon do
Fuck it I'll do it for you

[Lil'' Rob]
I'm having a conversation with somebody whos not even there
Hearin the voices inside my head saying you'll get no where he you care
I be the Lil'' Rob going insane when he calls me name
I'm hearing voices in my head and every night I do what says

[Demon Voices]
Lil'' Rob... tonight is the night
I better listen to my master
It's good bye, tonight is your night
You should of never messed with me
Never mess with, maricon

[Lil'' Rob]
It's the satanical, magical Lil'' Rob and The Shadow
We're coming at you like horns my mother regrets I was born
And I know you like it like porn treat the streets like hors leave em torn
In drop my rhymes like the storm when it rains it pours
I take form and I...
Hit the streets looking all nice and neat top fully creased
One hell of a looking beat the least of my feats from west to east
From north and south not knowing what it's all about top me on scout
Looking for my new recruits to follow my foot steps down my route
If you're not in you're out, to know what I'm feeling
I'm beggin you to stay and if you wanna come play
But if not your better pray cause I'm coming your way
TRUCHA

[Mr. Shadow]
Crimes pays when ever the fuck I inflict pain with pick
And I'm coming to stick you let satin be with you
Nobody will probably miss you when I diss you
If you want to fuck around with these two blad headed mothafuckas
That'll leave you in the mist when I clutch my fist
I'm pist you missed Apocalypse, I can't resist the bloodyness
The mess ain't over on 31st of October, I toldcha
The Virgin Mary won't hold, I'll scoldcha and moldcha into a deamon screamin
I'm leavin you sufferin wonderin why
I have a tail a pair of horns and glowin eyes
Baptisted in boiling water fuck the father I fucked his daughter
I got her under my wing, it ain't no thing now let the Devil sing

[Devil]
I'm back
So now you know that you're gonna fuckin burn in hell
Tell what you think then I will meet you at the crossroads, yeah</pre>
