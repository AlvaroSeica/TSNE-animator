Can't understand your shit
You fuckin' idiot
Fuck you, just leave me alone today
Fuck you, just leave me alone today!!
Better watch your mouth
Before I knock you out
Fuck you, just leave me alone today
Fuck you, just leave me alone today!!
Fuck are you lookin' at?
Give you a fuckin' slap
Fuck you, just leave me alone today
Fuck you, just leave me alone today!!
This ain't no way to live
Something has gotta give
Fuck you, just leave me alone today
Fuck you, just leave me alone today!!
Please, please, please let me fall asleep
I might be sufferin' from all this attention
My mind won't give it up
Now I'm like what the fuck?
See your world
See my world
No connectionSee me die for you
Watch me cry for you
Fuck you, just leave me alone today
Fuck you, just leave me alone today!!
This ain't no fuckin' style
Just cause you're in denial
Fuck you, just leave me alone today
Fuck you, just leave me alone today!!
I'm no good for you
And you know it too
Fuck you, just leave me alone today
Fuck you, just leave me alone today!!
I know I need some help
Can't trust my inner self
Fuck you, just leave me alone today
Fuck you, just leave me alone today!!
Please, please, please let me fall asleep
I might be sufferin' from all this attention
My mind won't give it up
Now I'm like what the fuck?
See your world
See my world
No connectionSave your hater shit
For that other bitch
Fuck you, just leave me alone today
Fuck you, just leave me alone today!!
I'm out of cigarettes
Something that you'll regret
Fuck you, just leave me alone today
Fuck you, just leave me alone today!!
I don't care no more
What are we living for?
Fuck you, just leave me alone today
Fuck you, just leave me alone today!!
Wrap me in celophane
To me, life's just a game
Fuck you, just leave me alone today
Fuck you, just leave me alone today!!
Please, please, please let me fall asleep
I might be sufferin' from all this attention
My mind won't give it up
Now I'm like what the fuck?
See your world
See my world
No connection</pre>
