Typed by: AZ Lyrics

It's like sun
[scratching] walk into the big time
check this out
One two y'all
It's just the k-o
Hookin' up now
Where brother lay low
1 2 y'all
It's just the P O S
grab the microphone
Keep the vibe funky fresh
One two y'all
Its just the freestyle
We like to represent but in the meanwhile
We gotta let you know exactly how the perforation
Flows from the niggas check it out yall

As days progress son
I stress to keep lyricism fresh
And if I'm rollin sess
I'm rollin blessed to my death
And now I reside on my earth
Since I illfied turf
Some wait for heaven to dispurse riches
It's Godly the worth
Earthly treasures be the measures
By which niggers get their pleasures
Often manifested through straight up crook endeavors
Sending big money
Spending street bet and beginners
Cost college education
Got niggas thinkin'

Now whats the matter with planet
These niggers can't understand it
They either shoot the ball
Or they shoot like a bandit
Can it
All the talk about the new order
I can see through the snicks
No mistake like order
You're order kick that shit back to the table
The world you wanna make
It seem similar to fables
Cain and able
They existed
So take a lesson
No guessin'
Just stressin'
Check my lyrical

Lyrical
Lyrical matters
Thrown to window shatter
Now who's badder
I don't know
But jenny craig ain't fatter
Everybody all around me
Wanna make a little green bow
With the blood upon your finger
No laundry can make it clean
And know what I mean
If you understand say sing
No living or dead president
Can ever make me golfing as i
Ressurrect the igan I from purgatory
It's nice to say history
But it's a white man fiction story

I rise like the sun sometimes
But then I fall
Like a black moon I rise
When the night calls
When the night falls
The mic calls so listen
Its the ultraviolet rays
That keep me risin' on the mission

I rise like the sun sometimes
But then I fall
Like a black moon I rise
When the night calls
When the night falls
The mic calls so listen
Its the ultraviolet rays
That keep me risin' on the mission

As I break through the door
Like I did before
Confusin' motherfuckers
With my metaphor
I implore, this be me, positivity
Take your whole consciousness on a journey, ya
To infinity
Right back again
People know me as the mic's best friend, ya
Now you know that it is me
Original one named positivity

I wanna be on top of the world
Like Scarface, Montana
Where bitches bought a purse
For my side to Savannah
Plan a first degree versery
Homicide cursory
Nigga know they shouldn't have stepped off the nursery
Vocally superior destruct your material
Leaving nigga's weary so the world will never hear of ya
Bury ya resurrect ya
Homicidal text ya
Drama side elect ya
Figure

Everybody loves the sunshine
No doubt we drop bombs son
It's the music in the message
Like the signs
One time for your mind
And a million for your soul
If your mental's in prison
Take the lyrics as parole
My soul could take my brothers to a higher level
Doing mind the devils or demons because it's hunting season
We can get together
Put lucy on the run
As long as we could rise like the sun
Like the sun

I rise like the sun sometimes but then I fall
Like a black moon I rise when the night calls
When the night falls the mic calls
So listen
It's the ultraviolet rays
That keep me risin' on the mission

I rise like the sun sometimes but then I fall
And like a black moon I rise when the night calls
When the night falls the mic calls
So listen
It's the ultraviolet rays
That keep me risin' on the mission

I rise like the sun sometimes but then I fall
And like a black moon I rise when the night calls
And when the night falls the mic calls
So listen
It's the ultraviolet rays
That keep me risin' on my mission

I rise like the sun sometimes but then I fall
And like a black moon I rise when the night calls
And when the night falls the mic calls
So listen
It's the ultraviolet rays
That keep me risin' on the mission

He can rise and she can rise
And we should all just recognize the rise
He can rise and she can rise
And we should all just recognize the rise</pre>
