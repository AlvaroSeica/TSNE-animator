[Spoken]
Rap, is just a stem
A part on the branch
That comes from what we are all about

[Verse 1: Slow V]
Yo, turn my mic up  I want to make sure they hear me
Loud and clear on this one

Yo this a new generation we live in, it's different
Where the government creates a space for every black in prison
They said the banned prejudice it's still all the same
Black man can't find a job unless he got a white name
They brain wash us into thinking we need to be luxurious
Live above our income, can't make no payments
We used to judge on actions, back then we had principle
Nowadays they rather see you sleep with the minerals
School board can't afford to keep the teachers
These kids will pray to Sponge Bob before they pray to Jesus
Even church ain't the same they got you paying for a seizure
Work hard get paid just to lace up the preacher
It's not sacred no more, we're losing the Holy War
I seen more people remarried, then blacks with bad credit scores
Over night lovers, families without structure
Kids without parents and babies becoming mothers
Even hip-hop done changed, this shit is just made ruckus
Nigga shits over a beat and the people love it
That's why I pass it down the line, so you can pass it down the line
So they'll never forget the true origin of rhyme

[Chorus 2X: Slow V]
Slow V, this is my new generation theory
Retro, this is his new generation theory
S.R. this our new generation theory
Yes y'all, this our new generation theory

[Spoken]
Everywhere in the world
Every high school, every junior high school
Every elementary school, got a rapper in it
So something that at one time in the early '70's &amp; '80's
Was a novelty, now is every day

[Verse 2: Retrospect]
Uh, yea
Just listen

Acceptance, the downfall of the human society
It's irony, no need to buy CDs because of piracy
Acceptance, lesbian adoptions and gay doctors
Wanting a call from the state office is straight non-sense
In gay alters, holy matrimony marriage
Having sex with dead bodies, horny cats will only cherish
Acceptance, sadomasochistic, no exceptions
Anorexics will be in effect as a human investment
Corrupted elections, and nothing is mentioned
Your daughter's fucking with gangsters with drugs on her necklace
The good is slowly fading; it's time for fucking action
That's why I wrote this rhyme, to make sure it doesn't happen
Infections, infections, somewhere down the line there's a misconception
Which will lead to an acceptance, don't misconceive the message
Just pass the knowledge chisel it in stone
So it will always be known that the start of hip-hop, was in the Bronx by Jamaicans
So when you hear this song pass it to your generation
You'll pass it down the line so he can pass it down the line
So they'll never forget the true origin of rhyme

[Chorus 2X: Retrospect]
Retro, this is my new generation theory
Slow V, this is his new generation theory
S.R. this our new generation theory
Yes y'all, this our new generation theory

[Spoken]
Even though you don't sell records
It has nothing to do with
Your level of skill as an emcee
Or your credibility in hip-hop
It might have something to do
With your level of skill or credibility
In the corporate board rooms
Whose bottom line is the dollar
And how many records you can sell
But who gives a fuck about them and their opinion
They know nothing about hip-hop</pre>
