[Intro]
Yeah, I'd like a couple of cheese burgers
Couple of Coca-Colas. (6th And Alvarado). Oh shoot, oh shoot

[Verse One]
Little mommy up at the Tommy's
Looking at you find me
(Eating your cheeseburgers) 
And you're sloppy, funny
I don't got no money 
You gotta little tummy
So we even okay?
I'm the bee, you're the honey
"What's your name?" 
"Maria" 
"I have no idea
What you're saying, what's your name?!"
"Maria" 
"Oh, well can we take it slow?
Go to the movie yo?
Do a little dancin' tippy toe?"
"No."
I see what you're doing 
Trying to play hard to get
I'm slow like a Chia Pet 
And have me pursuing
Cool that's okay 
With me, soon you'll see, baby
That you really what to be with the PJ!

[Chorus]
I'll take you paddling boating in the pond
Where they find the bodies in the dawn at
(6th and Alvarado)
We'll have a picnic in the lawn
While the local homeless people yawn at
(6th and Alvarado)
We can go shop at the mart
Just as long as we get home before dark at
(6th and Alvarado)
Unlock the doors to your car
Cause they break it no matter where you're park at
(6th and Alvarado)

[Verse Two]
"Ah you're cute poppi 
Cannot front but see
I gotta boyfriend and you don't what him. Aqui?" (What?)
"He sells rock, cocaine in the smoke or in the vein
Out in macarther park only after dark"
"He sounds like a wuss to me 
And it's clear to see
The young man has too much time on his hands
And I'm a G myself
Little skinny but well
I can easily tell that's not the master plan."
"well, what is it?" 
A little visit 
Me and you so exquisite
Wiggle ya little bit but so realistic
Take you back to Tommy's
(Cheeseburgers on me)
"Como te llamo?" 
"El Pigeon Juanny."

[Chorus]

I'll take you paddling boating in the pond
Where they find the bodies in the dawn at
(6th and Alvarado)
We'll have a picnic in the lawn
While the local homeless people yawn at
(6th and Alvarado)
We can go shop at the mart
Just as long as we get home before dark at
(6th and Alvarado)
Unlock the doors to your car
Cause they break it no matter where you're park at
(6th and Alvarado)
I know what you want
And I just know what you need
If you let your guard down honey
I'll catch you up to speed [4x]
Like swish y'all
Roll your windows down to this</pre>
