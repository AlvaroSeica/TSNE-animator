Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I said my niggas be rollin on sidewards sippin on shank(boss)
'Cause it ain't shit for young bosses in my camp
Certified goon 100 on stance
Got that hater throw on shade 'cause I'm shinen like a lamp
Shinen like a lamp, sh-shinen like a lamp
You see tha hater throw on shade 'cause I'm shinen like a lamp
Shinen like a lamp, sh-shinen like a lamp
Me and P-Mont in the caddy and we be slidin like a ramp[yeaa]
I get it like this like that
That purple shit that I be slingin stickin like mice traps
I take a lost but I don't fall I'm a get right back
I drop tha oils in the water and it just might

[talking: T.I.]

I get it like this like that
That purple shit that I be slingin stickin like mice traps
I take a lost but I don't fall I'm a get right back
I drop them oils in the water and it just might crack
Said it just mite snap yea it jus mite jump
Shit I mite jus hit it hard and come up jus like luck
I got these stitches in my face and said they jus like buck
So I pop them and watch them fade away at a player rage
I be a-ok kickin it like an 808[kickin it]
'Cause I get, if I dnt got it I make a way
Natural born hustla, ever since a youngin I been all about dat double up
Ya'll was playin double dutch, runnin with the girls I was
I was with the d-boys and how they make they sales
Now I do it well, I learned from the realest
If it ain't about no money then it ain't about me nigga
I gotta blok like this, can't wear skinny jeans 'cause my glock won't fit
No one on the corner got a swagga like dis
When I step up in the hood I be good real shit
Jus me no goon, or t-groon, got dem multi-colored diamonds lookin like a cartoon
See dem haters lookin at me wanna stick me harpoon
But I'm glizzy with dat grizzy put nigga on snooze
Fresh like Manny be, I said roll a face blue like gazanny be
I'm here now, they like can he be? Filght attendants
With the haters had plans for me, more money is what the maker had planned for me
But I'm back and watch the whole hood chant for me
I'm back now watch the whole hood chant for me
But I'm back.</pre>
