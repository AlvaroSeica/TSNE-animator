[The Jet Age of Tomorrow]
There's a monster in my bedroom
I saw him yesterday
And then he disappeared under the bed
He didn't even say hey
There's a monster in my room I don't know what to do
There's a monster in my room, I don't know what to do
I saw him the other night actually
He was, laying on my bedpost
and then he disappeared again
All I know is
There's a monster in my room I don't know what to do
There's a monster in my room, I don't know what to do
So I finally seen him again, he came out to lay
It's rather shy
He says hi, I... hey look!
There's a monster in my room
There's a monster in my room
There's a monster in my room
He's short, he's lovely
but unfortunately he's not for me
He's a monster he would never understand
But, he's just a monster in my room I want to do
He's a monster in my room that I wanna do
or maybe not - what do you think?</pre>
