[Verse 1: Braintax and Jehst]
Down and out in San Marino on a roulette binge
I'm trying not to cringe watch 'em tow the Bentley off
6 AM cold, yawn and gently cough
Never been a toff, self-made
Double 0 style gambling habit got played
I watch the sun rise, park bench thoughts
From San Moritz via Cannes, left my yacht in the port
Got a ticket, harbour master strangulation left him in the shed
Shit! I fled, 39 steps, I hope he's not dead

[Jehst]
Yo from cream tea at 3 o'clock with the Duke of York
To my photo-fit picture on the news report
Who'd have thought I caught glares true to form
On a nudist resort selling shares in porn

[Braintax]
And I was stepping out casinos like 'The world's now mine!'
And now I'm sitting in the sun with my cardboard sign
And weak pleas, and all day looking at knees
And me and Jehst rifle restaurant bins for free cheese

[Jehst]
Sipping on vino, flicking through a copy of the Beano
Me and my amigo Joe in the casino
With only 5 bucks in my snow white tux
Most times I rock a t-shirt that says 'Life sucks!'

[Braintax]
We went from hotel to motel to sleeping on the beach
drinking cheap wine laughing at you slurring your speech

[Jehst]
Pop the cork fill a glass, Anthill Mob with the illest cars
Still doing bank jobs in a gorilla mask
So I can buy my other half a chinchilla scarf
Chilling with my honey-dip in a vanilla bath

[Chorus: Braintax (and Jehst)]
How you like me now?
(I'm off to hustle in the sun if I'm down and out
Play the gent, tell lies) cos I'm Brando Flux
('Til the heat dies down) we'll be down on our luck
How you like me now?
(I'm off to hustle in the sun if I'm down and out
Quick change, switch names,) now I'm Brando Flux
(Low Lifes sport a tux) when we're down on our luck

[Verse 2: Braintax and Jehst]
The jewel thieves know me at the Intercontinental
Knowing that I'm just down on my luck and not mental
It's a funny scene: me and the gang with Peter Sellers
eating breakfast at the beach with a Swiss bank teller

[Jehst]
It's that fella sucking ash out of last night's lagers
In my flip-flops and pyjamas
Stranded somewhere off the coast of the Bahamas
The bandit with banana clips and balaclavas

[Braintax]
Riviera Joey Brains steps credit card flex
Bad scam, high society discovered who I am
They got suspicious when I passed on the ham
At the buffet in Cannes, with Prince Albert of Monaco at the soir√©e
Damn!

[Jehst]
I wanna parlay man, yeah you know those cats
that rock black suits and bowler hats
Playing Jack Jones tracks in our stolen Jags
Holding stacks of ice like the polar caps
A new night another heist better guard your stash
Run upon Guy Ritchie for his cards and cash
That's the snatch! Paparazzi can't relax
Al Fayed won't rest till my yards been trashed
I've been drinking all day but I'm hardly smashed
On safari, asking where the party's at

[Braintax]
I'm coming with a box of stones
The Pink Panther does the picking and he spots the clones
I'm like amazed, give him props and accept the cash
I'm off to hustle through the Alps on a ski resort dash
Watch the name splash: Howard Marks, deposit box, same bank
Say thanks security the safe cracks open, last bash
Now I'm stood looking at my last cash
And I'm considering the options I could load some hash
In Morocco at the stash by the customs check
I thought Yasser paid 'em off but I'm a nervous wreck
I take a valium or two and we relax, sail back
Juggle tourism and rap and make money in the gaps

LIKE THAT!

[Chorus: Braintax (and Jehst)]
How you like me now?
(I'm off to hustle in the sun if I'm down and out
Play the gent, tell lies) cos I'm Brando Flux
('Til the heat dies down) we'll be down on our luck
How you like me now?
I'm off to hustle in the sun if I'm down and out
Play the gent (life out I'm the real Prince William)
Investing all my winnings in bridge with Jack Nicholson</pre>
