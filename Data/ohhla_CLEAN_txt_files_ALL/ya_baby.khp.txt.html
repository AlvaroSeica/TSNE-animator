I ain't the one, the one to get played like a pooh butt
See I'm from the streets, so I know what's up

 "Hold on, hold on, wait a minute, fuck that shit
  why don't you kick some of this 99 shit for them baby mamas"

[verse 1]
Ya baby daddy, worst nigga that you ever met
First nigga that you ever sexed
Nigga had you crying
Couldn't get it in but I was trying
Said it wouldn't hurt but I was lying
Dying to hit some new poontang
Make you do things
Bare back, no hat, blood had the sheets stained
Cherry popped, now I hear you wanna marry Khop
Bitch I just barely hit the twat
Seems to be your doing to much
It always been funny, how time fly by
Now your doin two months
Same pussy gettin old like my aunt
Now I only hit when a nigga get drunk
On late night rondevous, creepin
Tossin up other hoes, cheatin
Hopin you was at the house sleepin
After work, sixty days later on the first
Got a page, baby mama gave birth

[chorus]
Ya baby daddy, worst nigga that you ever met
First nigga that you ever sexed
Ya baby daddy, forever causin shit and never sweat
Never thought he would of been a threat
Ya baby daddy, down for tossin anything he meet
Catch him crawlin in and out of sheets
Ya baby daddy, ain't no tellin where he might be
Mama warned you bout a nigga like me

[verse 2]
We's out, my little man about three now
And I don't even see how
I fucked with you in the first place
You been the worst case, since I met ya
I never satisfied ass ever
Left you in the kitchen
I'm out throw on this mission
Lookin for attention
Ran into this bitch, in a six
Shot the shit quick, got the digits
Same night we kicked it
Started of jokin, crankin, touchin
Then we got to smokin, drankin, fuckin
In the bath tub, smoke dubs, back rubs, soap suds
Rush the guts, bust a nut, no love, what the fuck
Back to the house around fo'
Stepped in the do'
Seen yo ass walkin cross the flo'
Pacin, accusin me of false allegations
Trick, I ain't did naythin
You wastin your time tryna get a playa stuck
Make him spill his guts
Now you wanna smell a niggas nuts
If I pull my balls out you gotta blow me
Damn good thing the other bitch washed 'em for me

[chorus]

She don't know, I fucked another hoe on the low
She don't know
She don't know, I fucked another hoe on the low
Khop say it ain't so
She don't know, I fucked another hoe on the low
She don't know
She don't know, I fucked another hoe on the low
Khop say it ain't so

[verse 3]
I got used to hittin new shit
Hey you ain't never knew shit
Hallin how a player do shit
But the plot got hectic
Some shit I least expected
That other broad popped up pregnant
Ain't this a bitch
That trick came with a twist
And i'm like what part of the game is this
I'm through
What the fuck a nigga suppose to do
With you, baby mama number two

 "Hello"
     Hello is Khop there?
 "This me, who this?"
     Man what, a better question would be, who the fuck is this
     who the fuck do you think you are nigga
     what you can't call me back after I been pagin you 911
     I remember there was a time I wouldn't even get the chance to page yo ass
     before you'd call me back, but now I got the pregnancy test
     you wanna act all new on a muthafucker, you crazy as hell

[chorus]

Yo, Mr. Short Khop with a dedication
To all the baby mama's world wide
Real nigga, in a real situation
Your baby daddy bitch, your baby daddy bitch

Put the whoop on it [X5]</pre>
