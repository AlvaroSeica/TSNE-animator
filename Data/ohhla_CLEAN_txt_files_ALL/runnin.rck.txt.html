Announcer:
Put your hands together
And give him a big round of applause
Come on give it up

Verse 1:
A hundred miles and runnin
Up is where I'm comin
Down is where you goin
Cuz I'm speedin while you slowin
Get out the fast lane man
Where you think you goin?
You blockin traffic
We'll be crashin 'fore you know it
Rear-ended
It's dented
Can't mend it
Career ended
It's dead yeah
Like a De La Renta on a dead man
I'm fashionably late, here to make an entrance
It's about time, that I go for mine
I been on my grind, now I gotta shine
Primetime, a new era's begun
Yours is over, it's done
I'm the black Neo, the one
I'm the four horsemen in one
Make the moon collide with the sun
Now that Armageddon has come
All the drama setters'll run
My Uzi still weighs a ton
Son, go find where you come from
Your crew run run run
Your crew run run run
Yeah

(Hook)
Comin comin comin comin (we comin comin)
Leave you runnin runnin runnin runnin (runnin runnin)
Comin comin comin comin (we comin comin)
Leave you runnin runnin runnin runnin (runnin runnin)
Comin comin comin comin (we comin comin)
Leave you runnin runnin runnin runnin (runnin runnin)
Comin comin comin comin (we comin comin)
Leave you runnin runnin runnin runnin (runnin runnin)

Verse 2
Yeah Yeah
This for my runners, my sprinters
My joggers, the robbers
Who runnin from the coppers
Who always wanna pop us
The club stampeders, who beat us to the exits
And plus the bumrushers, who crush us at the entrance
I'll mention, for instance, my ventures, inventions
Sends you into dementia
Enters a new dimension of Bass
It slaps you in the face
Leaves you with a taste
It takes, escape to a safe place to make you wanna say
Hey!
My fans run in place, bouncin at my shows to this
Soon as I pick which flow to spit
It's over with
You quote it cuz you know it's sick
Notice it
Risin to the top
My buzz bigger than yours was back before you flopped
I drop, like an atom bomb
Sprinters or a marathon
If you at a standstill, a treadmill that you runnin on
You ain't Paul Bunyan, so really you ain't gotta ax
M-P-D we, be the ones on this track

(Hook)
Comin comin comin comin (we comin comin)
Leave you runnin runnin runnin runnin (runnin runnin)
Comin comin comin comin (we comin comin)
Leave you runnin runnin runnin runnin (runnin runnin)
Comin comin comin comin (we comin comin)
Leave you runnin runnin runnin runnin (runnin runnin)
Comin comin comin comin (we comin comin)
Leave you runnin runnin runnin runnin (runnin runnin)

Verse 3:
See the moral of the story is
We the glorious
Beat Street laureates
Wild Style warriors
Uh! Notorious
Black Card carriers
Warning shots, buckshots
Clear out your areas
So give me room, or give me space
Win every fight, win every race
Leave my shows in the back of a trooper car
Fly lord, Style Wars
Rise of a superstarÂ…Yeah!

(Hook)
Comin comin comin comin (we comin comin)
Leave you runnin runnin runnin runnin (runnin runnin)
Comin comin comin comin (we comin comin)
Leave you runnin runnin runnin runnin (runnin runnin)
Comin comin comin comin (we comin comin)
Leave you runnin runnin runnin runnin (runnin runnin)
Comin comin comin comin (we comin comin)
Leave you runnin runnin runnin runnin (runnin runnin)
Throw your hands in the air ya'll (air ya'll)</pre>
