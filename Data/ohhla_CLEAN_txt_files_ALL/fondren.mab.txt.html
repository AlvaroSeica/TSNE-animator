I'm grabbing grain, in the turning lane
And I gotta maintain (cause the law behind me)
I've tried to leave the game, I know I need to change
(I need to resco' again) meet me on Fondren &amp; Main

[Z-Ro]
I was a superstar at seventeen
Famous in the ghetto, for working a triple beam
Somebody told me it was destiny, for me to suffer
Cause when the going gets rough, it only gets rougher
I had to make a quick change from Lunchables, and a spot on the bus
To eating at Papa Deauxx everyday, and a Suburban with bump
I got the game from my partna, but all he told me was Ro
Before you get your feet wet partna, you better be sho
If you get caught it's Penitentiary time, understand
Fronted me nine, and now we got the hottest on the van
My grandmother knew what it was doing, because my pockets stuck out
And plus she told me I love you, but get your shit out my house
All I ever wanted to do, was just shine a little
Bump and grind a little, and then recline a little
Trying to protain, lavish have it like the H.A.W.K
You need another zone then I'm on my way, because I'm trapped in the game

[Dougie D]
Well I done came from crumbs to bricks
While I'm hustling up in the city streets
On the block of Fondren and Main, coppers know where the killas be
When I get out I'm gonna make me a change
The whole situation, seemed a bit strange
Everybody wanna die, somebody brain
Dougie D, trying to collect a little change
And grip the grain, swang turning lanes
With a whole bunch of hoes, yelling out my name
Pop trunk open wide, up in down South mayn
And when I work the wood, I lean on maintain
Or put it on your brain, ain't worried bout a damn thang
Without leaving this shit, and everybody need to change
But plus again, ain't worried bout a damn thang
Set up shop, up on Fondren and Main

[Taz]
I wish I was the one with the top down
In a chromed out Benz, with all my friends
Bank account, with unlimited ends
Gripping, I ain't sweating the rent
The only problem is, I'm a FED fella
With no intentions on, taking a loss
And everytime I see the law, my heart pauses
Riding dirty, everytime I'm flossing
I got tossed in the game, at a early age
Trying to push pounds and tons
Looking for fortune and fame
Through the smoke of my Mary Jane
Trying to control the game
Instead of trying to find another way to stay paid
I was stuck at a materialistic stage
Now I have a piece and chain, with expensive shades
Trying to resco' again, now I got two chances
I could pay the cost, and everyone they take a loss
So when the laws come, shake em off
Headed for the border man, I'm making it cross
Or I could break off a tight job, and do it right this time
Is you crazy baby, I gots to grind
