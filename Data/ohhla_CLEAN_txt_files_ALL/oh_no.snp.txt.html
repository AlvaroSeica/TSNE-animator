[50 Cent talkin] It's 50 Cent and S-N double O-P
You don't want no snoop and you don't want it wit

[chorus (50 Cent)]
Everytime I come around they like "Oh No"
I get to trippin; slap the clip up in my 44
Shit I been thruin my hood made my heart cold
I get to poppin off that thang like loco
No sense in coppin pleas when you see my knife out (knife out)
Motherfuckers light out (light out)

here come snoop, uh (oh shit) (Oh No)
sup nigga, supnow huh? (Oh No)

[Snoop Dogg]
Ricky Ticky Timble, C's is the symbol
Courdoroy khakis, stacies &amp; brimmed up
Straight razors just keep you trimmed up
1-8-7, oh yeah, now you remember
He's electrifyin &amp; original
So gangster, Snoop Dogg the criminal
The one you hate to love, in the club, in the cut
hugged up wit yo bitch, nigga I don't give a shit
You betta check dat hoe, that's what wreckin G
Now step your game down, cuz ain't no checkin me
Or my gat'll go boom, bullets so zoom
Now your name on a tomb
they pourin out liquor wit no room to consume, silly bafoon
I pop niggaz like balloons, I ain't feelin em
walkin in my big blue chuck cuz I'm killin em

[Chorus]

[talkin] Hey what up cuz, it's 50 Cent;
What's happin nigga?

[50 Cent]
Ever since the moment I was born I been dyin (yea)
Hundred miles an hour pulse flyin wit my eye... an
He who fears fate lives like coward
You go against me, you'll be devoured
Then you get to poppin you'll have change of heart
I hit your chest a couple times you'll have to change your heart
Have doc usin donors, dead niggaz wit spare parts
You come back wit lungs of a snicth, and the heart of dead nark
Niggaz never see the light till spark
Then they bleed, it get cold , then shit get dark
You can call me the beast from the east, I run these street
You can eat hollow tip shell or you can work for me
These rap niggaz crazy, my mercy has limits
Push me a hundred revolvers'll get to spinnin
Your services are no longer needed; rock-a-bye baby
My bitch will do it to you with a lil 380 (yea)

[Chorus]

[snoop dogg]
I'm bailin thru the door again
Let momo pour again
Me and my hoe again
Yea she got the four up in this motherfucker
And imma bust it if you try to rush us or touch us or sucka ducka us
It'll crak off, now back off -real slow
An if you don't know , I never hesitsyr to shoot a hoe
Yea that reputation - you test my patience &amp;
You &amp; your fam - bam - gon hear the blam, blam
Goddammit I'm at it again
They done let bitch niggaz up outta the pen
And now he lookin for me - what the hell - my game is built on repect
Now I'm brathin down your motherfuckin neck
I dumps till my clip is empty
I'm headin down willshire to send the scent
And when I get there don't ask who sent me
Just take dem shots and drop it like it hot
Bitch nigga

[Chorus]

[talkin]

just when you though I was gone
slide back up on you likr the wind nigga
