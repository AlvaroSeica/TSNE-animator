"Sometimes like me and you gotta kick it here old school
Yeah this is, this is truly old school
Definitely old school"

[Chorus: Kno and Deacon]
Yo, Yo
We keep the whole day so live
Felas
We keep the whole day so live
My ladies
We keep the whole day so live
Lynguistics
We see the whole day so live

[Kno]
Get live, set to destroy all the fakers
Cos this ones for the B-Boys and the breakers
Take ya to another level with the sound
Freaking the flow, kicking it low getting down
Take it all back to the essence
When you could go to a party and not leave with your head split
(Get This)
Cunninlynguists getting live
Respect the foundation that hip-hop vibe

[Deacon]
Now get up get up
Gunna rip up rip up
Any motherfucker in here they dont shut there shit up
Puts your hands up like it's a stick up
I got ya head jerking like some hick-ups
Its Deacon the Villan
Ill'ing with my nigger rolls
Rappers be soft, they probably walk on their tippy toes
Word up Jays game, and roll diggy (Go)
Flows potent, even my breath smells like sticky dro*

[Chorus]

[Deacon]
Im chillin the French way, I'm not the best
But more or less, the style is (finest)
For those that test, I shake em down like bumpy nuts
Smashed out their face, even slam it like a dummy cut
(Ohhhhhh!)
Yo
(Hold up!)
Kentucky shogun
Who's the master
(Showed up)
Ya damm right, deep in the last dragon
Flows off the wall like they outlaw tagging

[Kno]
Understand me when I tell you this
I got the style that'll give you fits
And get you pissed that ya can't rhyme like this
Hype with the type of shit that leave ya hyper tense
(Get down!)
When ya feel it dont be acting stiff
(Get down!)
Just go on ahead and grab a tit
(Get down!)
Do they dance a bit, before ya hit em
(Get down!)
(Thats that shit)

[Chorus]

[Deacon]
Im a gun (Ohhhhh!)
Cocked and ready
Bested to leave ya head spinning like Rock Steady
Get mistaken for a B-Boy breaking your dome
Off dependent like ????? out the O-Zone
A rap ????? You better be ducking and weaving
Take a breath so we can bound sucking your teeth in
When Kno's on the 1200's, cutting and bleeding
When I'm stuck in my broom like it aint nothing and leaning

[Kno]
I just knicked the mic and crushed Cataclysmic
Blast a sentence that would leave a rapper limping
Nowadays cats only rap about their bankroll
But ive been fresh ever since fuzzy Kangol
*Hey Yo*
Dont y'all be starting nothing
Just chill the hell out while we keep the party jumping
I know my style feeling nice
Me and my man Deacon the Villian keeping it live</pre>
