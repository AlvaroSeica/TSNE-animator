Clip clop, clip clop (Repeat 4x)
Hiding in the desert between the sand dunes
haven't slept in three moons
I'm running off fumes
Plus, I'm feeling sick with Montezuma's revenge
but I know I can't quit until the madness ends (We gotta keep moving!)
We're too close
And the enemy's scared, man, we got 'em on the ropes
So, hold your pistol on the low, and your head high
Look 'em, dead in the eye and shout the war-cry (People stand up!)
Let's start a revolution
I'm fed up with being pushed around
We gotta fight back! And start a revolution
It's about time that we stood our ground
You see, it was ten or so years ago
When they rolled up in the town and stole the show (Stole the show)
They used sex, intimidation and violence to plunder
And take the people under like pirates
They started spreading their seeds about
and we tried to resist, but they squeezed us out
So we went underground, off the map
Now we're on our way back, now we're on our way back!

"This is it."
"You know what they do, they steal and erupt!"
"This is the moment."
"Better step back!"
"Okay, mister, no more nice guy."

[Andy Cooper]
Now, I had a strategy, take 'em out rapidly
Break into their stronghold and blow a battery
I called a meeting and I drew up the plans
Volunteers? Fifty men then threw up their hands
I need one group on the boulevard
When you signal, just shoot with no regard
It's only a distraction (what?) so no killing
As you make noise we'll break in the main building
and head for the stash spots, with the cash pots
We'll take it all, and bleed 'em till the last drops
Then we'll need to tie up the guards
Cut the phone lines and set the charge
We'll make our escape then listen as the guns blow
Turn around and watch the walls crumble
Finally, we get what's rightfully ours
and put those who held us back behind bars
So, hit the sack at the crack of dawn
It's time to rise up the attack is on
The next morning we gathered on a prairie
Looking down on the town from a cemetery

"This is it."
"Artillery weapon for the enemy."
"This is the moment."
"Loa-loa-loaded about to explo-plo-plode it!"
"This is it."
"Best move you can make is a move to surrender."
"This is the moment."
"Better step back!"
"We're off to fight!"

[Andy Cooper]
I told the boys tighten up your boots
put on your sombrero
Today, we go in to overthrow the pharaoh
We rode town, but everything was vacant
Except for one vagrant asleep on the pavement
We were puzzled, then the church bell rung
And someone shouted, "Stop the rebellion!!"
We all ducked and ran for protection
Gunshots struck from every direction
Man, what had happened? We must'a been spied out
Later, I heard we had a traitor in our hideout
We were in trouble, this could be our last stand
Then I saw a masked man jump out of a trash can
He took aim, and caught my arm
A half a foot to the left, I'd have bought the farm
I was alive, but I couldn't stay vertical
Fall into the dirt below, like I had vertigo
I crawled out of the street into a pool hall
Out of bullets, so I threw a cue ball
Now I'm surrounded, it's looking grim
They yell, "Come out or we're coming in!"
I said, "Boys, can you say it again?"
Reloading my weapon and I started to grin
The odds are long and I might not live
but I'm coming out shootin' like the Sundance Kid

"Alright! We've got you surrounded..
Now come out with your hands up or it's gonna get ugly. And I mean UGLY!"
"You'll never take me alive!"
"Gentlemen...let's proceed."

Start a revolution...
Start the revolution...

"Townspeople say they will never forget the scene..."
"I just did what I had to do..."

Yeah, holmes, let me get a, um, get me a beef-peef
Uh, let me get a, uh
Two carnita shakes, and, uh, one, uh, turkey-shake and two beef-shakes
