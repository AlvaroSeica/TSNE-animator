Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Me no see no other way, but me no see no other way
The one way me seeing is the righteous way
Me no see no other way, but me no see no other way
The one way me seeing is the righteous way

Bounce with me, come real, take me
Follow some of them right on over to the right mental stylee
Keep me head above the water, they walking improper
Watch you children, they must be moron brotha
First glance sight, they got to be shotta
Respect the icons, they are the transcendors
Bob Marley, Euroy, Peter Tosh, and Bunny Wailer
How we come up me wonder, who some are who follow

Me no see no other way, but me no see no other way
The one way me seeing is the righteous way
Me no see no other way, but me no see no other way
The one way me seeing is the righteous way

Allow me a beat to follow I'll do this
How would it feel to meditate and I'll study from this
On the Billboard chart they'll bring back me hit
Give me the mic and run the track, the Mister start a spit
Tell them a Mr. Mutton time boy, they exit
Cartez sent them out with friend but them a hypocrite
Border line nigga, tell them don't cross it
How all don't me carrying a basket

Me no see no other way, but me no see no other way
The one way me seeing is the righteous way
Me no see no other way, but me no see no other way
The one way me seeing is the righteous way

Bounce with me, pound the floor, this entity is done
He has done so many things, some man was done but then become
A man if he understand how the world runs

But you can't be ungrateful

And now allow me a beat to follow I'll do this
How would it feel to meditate and I'll study from this
On the Billboard chart they'll bring back me hit
Give me the mic and run the track, the Mister start a spit

Me no see no other way, but me no see no other way
The one way me seeing is the righteous way
Me no see no other way, but me no see no other way
The one way me seeing is the righteous way, and

I just wanna, a living in the righteous way
I don't wanna, be in the Babylon way
I don't wanna, __ can call me __
I don't wanna, move with the pagans down

Tell me, tell me when you're ready for me
Tell me, tell me when you're ready for me

And I don't wanna no, follow the Babylon way
I just wanna, put myself into the righteous way, way

Tell me when you're ready
tell me when you're ready
To bend down on your knees and pray
Tell me when you're ready
tell me when you're ready
To bend down on your knees and pray, come in
I don't wanna, a living in the

I don't see no other way, I don't see no other way
One way I see it is the righteous way
I don't see no other way, I don't see no other way
One way I see it is the righteous way</pre>
