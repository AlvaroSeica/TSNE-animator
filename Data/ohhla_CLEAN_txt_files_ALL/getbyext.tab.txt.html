[Mos Def]
lets see, this is happenin every day y'all
(right now), right now, right now
(GOOD MORNING VIETNAM!)
Listen brooklyn wins again
It's the 'Stuy, its the 'Bush, them niggas again
Ta' Kweli, mighty Def, and S Dot on the guest, got
Kanye, yo the dopeman of hip hop now lets rock
And roll out niggas, my hometown niggas
Will get it good in yo' hood, so slow down niggas
Watch the speed though, mind ya pedal and ease off
Or screech off into a collision course of these walls
They don't move, don't break, don't lose
Don't sleep, life passin, life's flashin
Life happens that fast, par-da-don
Black hands up in prayer, black guns up affair
Dyin wishes to touch the air
seekin Heaven, it wasnt here
Eyes will not see another year, its another day
It's the same fight, different round, sound the bell
Mix it up, in victory ya live it up
The beat'll get risen up, ya knocked down
And get back and get it up
Get off of queer street and get wit us
And get clear where we get it, from the heart, from the people
From the top, from the deep, from the gut, from the street
From my soul, to the mic, to the essence
So in my absence you feel the prescence, exactly
I make contact wit shorter mc
Me and mind we don't justify, we get free

[Jay-Z]
(Mos niccah!)
Just to get by
Nigga I sold coke, nigga I pushed lah
Carried a four five
Claimed I was ready to die
Promised never to cry
Held it all inside
Reality was too much to take so I
Kept my mind fried
Slept for most of mine
Soon as I closed my eyes
Then I woke up behind
Nigga either I load up these nines
Or blow up with rhymes
Cuz this flow of mineis like blow up wit lines of coca'
And you folks think Hov' just wrote stuff to rhyme
Nah, I'm a poster for what happened seeing your moms
Doin five dollars worth of work just to get a dime
So pardon my disposition
Why should I listen to a system that never listened to me?
Picture me working McDonald's (uh uh yea)
I'd rather pull a mac on you
Sorry Ms. Jackson but I'm packing, bye

[Kanye West]
It's like I got that Nina Simone piano flow
It's like a Michaelangelo painted a portrait of Maya Angelou
And gave it to a sick poet for they antidote
If music get ya choked up, this is the tree and the rope
This the Chi' nigga, I'm Mr. All of That
Fuck a map, let's put this bitch on an almanac
Dice what they hittin fo', lacs what you sittin on
Tracks who you spittin on?, rap till we get it on
And don't let nobody with the power to sign
Ever tell you you ain't got the power to rhyme
They used to tell me toughen up, put some bass in ya voice
They used to tell me lighten up, put some Mase in ya voice
Lord willin, I ain't killed nobody
But I have a feelin this album that I'm gonna make a killin
Well now its chillin, this is love it or hate it music
But...at least we made it music
And we didn't make it industry, this is gon' be interestin
This'll be the end of me, or I'm finna be a entity
Kanye, Jay-Z, Mos Def and Kweli
We are not makin songs no more, we're makin history

[Hook: Talib Kweli + background singers]
This morning I woke up
Feelin brand new and I, I jumped up
Feelin my highs and my lows
In my soul, and my goals
Just to stop smoking and stop drinkin
But I been thinkin I got my reasons
Just to get by, just to get by
Just to get (by), just to get
(everybody get your hands in the sky, it go)
[background singers]2x
bah dah bah dah, bah dah bah dah
Bah dah bah dah, bah dah bah daaah

[Talib Kweli]
Just to get by, just to get by
(Talib Kweli) Just to get by
We keep it gangsta, stay 'fo shizzle', 'fo sheezy'
To set the tide to the violence on the TV during the war
Killin each other is easy, there's whores and liquor for fallen niggas
Believe me, it's ghetto lavacious, seen it all befo'
Just to get by, my people we get fly
My people we get high, fillin cigars with the lah
Nigga come on, even Jesus was stoned before receivin the throne
I said rest in peace to Nina Simone

[Busta Rhymes]
Back in the days we was used to doin the shit
I can't call it all in the streets
We was hustlin fiends that asked for it
I guess I was used to just standin on corners
Waitin for paper bags with bundles of crack
Hopin the week was good so I could get money back
To get by, just to get by, just to get by, just to get by
When I was stressed I possessed a side of my strength
That made me angry and bleed
With the frustration havin me smokin Newports and weed
To get by, just to get by, just to get by, just to get by
Those be the times when I try to rely
On my niggas and street motherfuckers
And reach out to wifey and then I place a call on my mother
To get by, just to get by, just to get by, just to get by
(Hey yo mom pick up the phone, I g- I gotta to talk to you ma)
If you was five percent instead of actin stupid and guessin
You had to go and study your lessons
And know your math in the building recession to get by

[Hook: Talib Kweli + background singers]
This morning I woke up
Feelin brand new and I, I jumped up
Feelin my highs and my lows
In my soul, and my goals
Just to stop smoking and stop drinkin
But I been thinkin I got my reasons
Just to get (get), just to get (get)
Just to get (get), just to get (get buh buh buh bye bye)
[background singers repeat in the background]
bah dah bah dah, bah dah bah dah
bah dah bah dah, bah dah bah daaah
