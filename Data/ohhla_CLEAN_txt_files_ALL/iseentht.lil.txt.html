Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
Why niggas don't keep it real no more?
Leaning on the next man
Trying to get some dough
And I ain't making a diss
This really exists
Last time I made love is
When I wrote this song
People: you saying "B
You should be a preacher"
Like I told em far back
I'ma be a teacher
I told em one day
That we gonna reach it
This is cut down on songs
I don't got no features
Keep my squad close like we [?]
I don't got greedy, man
The fame is enough
And for people trying to hate
Saw my money
Karma is real, and you gotta love it
I could take a few trips in advance
Look! I'm flying to the snow and
I visit the sand, see
Life's real, when you're tied up in Japan man
My face is in the streets
You have my picture in your hand
Let's get it

So many questions I got...

[Verse 2]
Why bitches don't keep it real no more?
Hopping on the next flight
Just to see you, but she don't know
That the game is played,
Try to say she love me
Naw, you love my fame
Cause real life: you don't know my name
You just know my lane
BasedWorld: it's a gorgeous game
I gained twice
I'm in the game
Y'all's after the catch
I'm in the dip like I'm on the Mets
On TV like I'm on the Nets
Bet I throw bombs like I'm on the Jets
How much I'm worth? I should make you guess
How much I work? It'll make you stress
I work hard like I'm living check-to-check
I made my mind up, I'm coming for respect
Bitch I love this life
I wouldn't trade it for the world
I guess I'm selfish, right?
It's Lil B!

[Verse 3]
Now I be off like Kim's shit
Two mansion, five cribs
That's that king shit
Got so much money, on the hole that it leaks
Dream is to deal with me
Shit, young man doing what I'm supposed to do.
I can hear the money speak
I suppose it's true..
It said I'm coming soon
But I'm dropping sooner!
Let this shit drop then I cop it sooner
Lil B, you got my back for the love of the music
I appreciate your mind and I appreciate your soul
And that's just my promise
I give you my soul and the music's promised
Only one life, I'ma live it regardless
Only one mic, look at what we started!
Look at me now: how I get so tight
Nigga, day in, day out, bitch I seen that light
Let's go!</pre>
