[Hook - 2x]
Its so haaa-aard
Living our life as thugs
I know, I gotta stay strong
Through all the pain, we gotta move on

[Dougie D]
Every day that I live life, a nigga steady be trying
To deal with the drama, then the struggle and pain
Don't wanna go and do the wrong thang, cause a nigga know
I gotta keep my mind focused, for my little girl reign
My baby mama ain't coming, instead of playing them games
Made them kidnap, there his baby
Alisha and Jennifer, Christopher care less
And y'all gon pay for what you did, yeah yeah
And I'ma put it in the Lord's hand, and let it be
And ain't no looking for war, that the Lord can't beat
Child gon see heavenly father, in the sky
Will you deliver me, from my enemies
Although my pain burns deep, through my fate struggles
I prayed for these peeps, revelation has been revealed
That the world is coming to, an end surely
Hope you understand, and shorty this is a message from my father
Save my soul, don't stress if I'm balling, what is it for
A lot to gain the world, but to lose a soldier
For the love of balling, hoping that you can hear me darling
Dear Lord keep us all here from falling, this is my world
This is my promise, keep me humble to raise my daughter

[Hook - 2x]

[Trae]
Fin to make me another nigga feel my pain, stressed out
Praying in chains, sick of living the game and it'd never be the same
I've been here too much, all of my niggas I love
Getting locked up, and dropping in the ground too much
I would give my life to see em, smile again
All of the pain that I feel, fin to run me dry
Look in the sky, and why my niggas had to die
These tears that I cry, can't bring back the time
Of life, the time we use to ride together
On the grind, to get us in we gon get this chedda
And now a nigga write letters, and feeling the rainy weather
To my brother in the penn, praying that its gonna get better
We tougher than leather, never ever will I get bucked
Aggravated in the mind, and about to click up
Being broke and my head, I got to keep up
Any devil running up, they about to get bust
I put it on my life this world is shife, everybody gon wanna die
But I'ma pay that price, before I sell my soul trying to wheel the fast life
You better feel my vibe, and try to get your mind right
Now this is the sound of a thug's cry, I can't lie
Lord please tell me why, when a nigga try to do right
Everything starts to go bad, so I'm begging my Lord to help me fight back

[Hook - 3x]

I gotta stay strong, a lonely life
And I've been trying, to live my life
I've been struggling, just to live life
I'm tired, I'm tired of living li-ife
And I've been struggling, just to live life
I'm doing my best, to provide for my child
And everyday that I'm living li-ife
And I'ma continue to hold it down
Ye-eah, I gotta hold it down
And I'ma continue to hold it down
I'm looking up to my father, in the sky
Until he come got me, and give me my props
And I don't wanna, let you down
But I've been struggling, just to hold it down
And I'ma continue to live li-ife 
I gotta stay focused, and live my life right</pre>
