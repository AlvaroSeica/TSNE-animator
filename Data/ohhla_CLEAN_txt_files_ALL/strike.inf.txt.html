Prepare for the battle, prepare for the war
Prepare for the real Street Fighter blood war
The third of the third, prepare to die for
Your life's on the line so I'ma take yours
So who wanna blood dance with me?
Get your body wrapped up or you ????? street fantasy
In the square yo you best to beware
Street Fighter we ain't playin over there
One on one kid you know you get finished
?????????? so come and get with it
Your heart ain't close so forget about the power
Battle this style to the 24th hour
Pay the price that you could't deal with
Cold blooded killers in my LockDown click
Got no time to waste, we tickin time bombs
Street Fighter 3 like this scar on my arm

Yo make your first move, so what's in gon' be?
You're trapped in the new world of Street Fighter 3
The 3rd chapter so what's it gon' be?
You're trapped in the new world of Street Fighter 3
Make your first move, so what's in gon' be?
You're trapped in the new world of Street Fighter 3
The 3rd chapter so what's it gon' be?
You're trapped in the new world of Street Fighter 3

Yo rock what you got. Block what you shot
Another chapter and what you get is what you got
'Nuff warriors here to fight, choose one
The best of the best will be the champion
Whose world is this after all?
Capcom living with LockDown forever y'all
?????? sees the violence and death
?????? so ain't ready yet
If a pack they ain't ready step up with all you got
With the fighters who ain't ready take your regular
spot
So what? Come down before it's too late to stop
Tryin to front like you was kids of the block
Step too close kid you might get shot
Only one master's goin straight to the top
One false move your whole game gets blocked
Only one master's goin straight to the top

Yeah, yo
You're about to get your life with something you wish
you wouldn't
It's too late, you gotta borrow what you wish you
couldn't
Pass the first stage, you thought you could live it
Now you just realized you never could survive it
Dealin with cold blooded assassinators
Decapitate your body give the food to alligators
You needa put your power over here it's much greater
It's either you push start or try again later
It's all about the confidence bet they don't cater
You got no time to talk to the player haters
I guess on ?? kid will leave your body critical
Talkin bout real street thugs and big criminals
Now you're helpless all the way to the finish
Where you can practice, come back and get with it
You can't bite my hits, the sky's no limit
Anything distant yo it's Infinite

Make your first move, so what's in gon' be?
You're trapped in the new world of Street Fighter 3
The 3rd chapter so what's it gon' be?
You're trapped in the new world of Street Fighter 3
Make your first move, so what's in gon' be?
You're trapped in the new world of Street Fighter 3
The 3rd chapter so what's it gon' be?
You're trapped in the new world of Street Fighter 3
Yo make your first move, so what's in gon' be?
You're trapped in the new world of Street Fighter 3
Fight for the future, so what's it gon' be?
The 3rd strike y'all it's Street Fighter 3
Make your first move, so what's in gon' be?
You're trapped in the new world of Street Fighter 3
Fight for the future, so what's it gon' be?
The 3rd strike y'all it's Street Fighter 3</pre>
