[Dizzy Dustin]
Why'd you have to go and leave me out in the cold?
I was too young, so how could I know
You didn't give me a light when I tried to grow
and then you jetted out and took a piece of my soul
Sticks and stones may chip at your bones
Especially when they hit so close to home
But I cut all the losses, buried all the skeletons
Dropped all the grudges, I can be myself again
That's the past and I'm moving on fast
And I won't blame you for the cause of collapse
They say you've got to live to forgive and forget
Cause holding on to it is a bigger regret

[Chorus: Andy Cooper]
All of the words they said
That debts been paid in full
All of the things they did
I can let it go, I can let it go
The hate, the hurt, the fear, the pride
It all just disappear when I concede..
It never mattered at all..
It never mattered at all..
It never mattered at all..
(None of the words they said)
It never mattered at all
(None of the things they did)
It never mattered at all..

[Andy Cooper]
I feel sick when I go over my resume
both at who I am and things I did yesterday
Fantasizing I could take it back
but it's a wasted act, have to face the fact that
I've got to live with the pain I've caused
And walk amongst those who sustained to loss
Picking up the pieces of broken trust
When their hopes were crushed down to smoke and dust
I said I didn't know and played the role beautifully
Then I abandoned you when it suited me
It's a stain that I can't erase
And I'm ashamed, but I can only ask for grace cause

[Chorus: Andy Cooper]
All of the words they said
That debts been paid in full
All of the things they did
You can let it go, you can let it go
The hate, the hurt, the fear, the pride
It all just disappear when we concede..
It never mattered at all..
It never mattered at all..
It never mattered at all..
(None of the words they said)
It never mattered at all..
(None of the things they did)
It never mattered at all..

[Andy Cooper] (Repeat 2x)
Hey, hey
It never mattered at all
Ho! It never mattered at all

"We promise to reveal the sound of the kia
Now listen, to the tremendous force of the scream.
It is powerful enough to kill...</pre>
