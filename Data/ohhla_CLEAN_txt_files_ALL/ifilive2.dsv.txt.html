{*clears throat*}
If I live to see tomorrow, that tomorrow better be polite
I've spent my life in darkness, I'm beggin for some bright
I'm ready for the light, lime
I've left my coat and umbrella behind
I told the weatherman please let the weather shine
or get ready for a milkshake Nick Cage
Let him breathe or let him slide, let it be or let him die
Paul +Live and Let Die+ like Lennon in the Rye
by Salinger and Chapman, Dakota dead inside
I've said it all before though I've never said it twice
I've never said it twice, I've never said it twice
I'm the devil in disguise and it's been one hell of a life
I'm the one who fed the fire, the one who fanned the flames
The one who had the balls to get a canvas to stain
and splashed that motherfucker like Jackson with paint
I'm Pollock on the beat, bleeding passion and pain
They laughin at my face, they jabbin at my weight
like I'm some clown slippin on banana peels
My face ain't a target for your coconut cream
Your low self-esteem so obvious
All because you're nobody - tippy-toe Napoleon's heels
Dynamite or Bonaparte
You see the truth is, we're a couple globes apart
And on mine, I represent the broken-hearted
While you're alone on yours; a solo artist
Disrespect me on the YouTube comment board
But get used to the face on your monitor
Everybody wants me to be what they want me to be
but I ain't no motherfuckin Commodore
Fuck sex appeal, I don't know how to sell
I'm a writer tryin to write my mind out of hell
Without a combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell
Fuck a novelty to get the world to follow me
I pen magic, but haven't seen a penny paid
Rap's Lennon, tryin to pen a Penny Lane
Very strange, I stumbled over every shake
My road travelled is bumpier than Lemmy's face
Three years spent spittin lyrics written for
listeners sick of all them piss poor spitters for
a stroke down tryin to multiply my, three years
worth of listeners by a million more in my fourth
I'm not stupid - I'm never makin Puffy ends
But underground groups generate a couple M's
And I want to see five before my fuckin end
I don't wanna die, and be discovered then
And go from four albums loved by a dozen fans
to another million jumpin on my bandwagon screamin
"D was fuckin man" loud enough for Spin Magazine to hear
And maybe spare me some fuckin press
Then my money hungry sister and her husband
can't slander me on paper, and publish it, fuckin pig
And every dream seller with they false promises
can kneel before my coffin and suck my dick~!
So if I live to see tomorrow, that tomorrow better be polite
I've spent my life in darkness, I'm beggin for some bright
I'm ready for the light, lime
I've left my coat and umbrella behind; I love you
So take Jonestown, take it all
Take my catalogue - I don't want your cash
Just listen to the words, that's all I ask
I'm tired of writin for the walls and my starvin cats
I'm sick of bein overlooked by these fucks scared to think
that don't get my references so they call me whack
I'm not skinny and I wear glasses
I'm not slim so they choose not to listen
and call me fat, just heard the new Adele record
That record's great, but have you seen Adele? She's fuckin fat
Beth Diddo's new solo record's coming, I heard the snippets
Too bad she's so fucking fat
Phillip Seymour Hoffman's brilliant in his new picture
But who cares? He's fucking fat - what the fuck's with that?
See the difference is you look like Fozzy Bear
flame and not Jonah Hill, but I can fuckin rap
So when the bullet's in my brain
and the ambulance arrives to load me in they truck in a body bag
And the story's unexplained in Chart Attack
with a photograph of me in a plague doctor's mask
And Kaplan says, he gave it all away
cause the music was all he had, yeah
So if I live to see tomorrow, that tomorrow better be polite
I've spent my life in darkness, I'm beggin for some bright
I'm ready for the light... {*sighs*} {*whistling*}</pre>
