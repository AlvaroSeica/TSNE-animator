[Saul Williams]
Well, there're two ways I can say this
And one would be: fuck you!
And there're no two ways around it
Because one would be untrue
(Because) I love everything about you...
But I don't want to be around you

[Chorus: Saul Williams]
If you control my heart, will you control my brain?
If I give in to you, will it still feel the same?
Cause I want nothing more than to be here with you
If you fulfill my dreams, will that fulfill you too?
I need a second
I need a second to think
I need a second

[Saul Williams]
Now, the other way to play this
Would be mellow, light, and, cool
Poetry and meditation
Higher ground and higher truth
(Because) I love everything about you...
But I use everything to doubt you

[Chorus: Saul Williams]
If you control my heart, will you control my brain?
If I give in to you, will it still feel the same?
'Cause I want nothing more than to be here with you
If you fulfill my dreams, will that fulfill you too?
I need a second
I need a second to think
I need a second

[Saul Williams]
I found the spot where truth echoes and know each beauty mark by heart
But I just can't keep her still enough to render perfect art
Cause the truth is ever changing and although she loves my touch
I've had my way, but I when I pray, she kisses back too much
And it's hard to feel real gangster when you're always getting kissed
But you jump at every pucker, cause your fear of getting dissed
I try not to fight the parts of me that want to kiss her back
Egos should be illegal, mine just don't know how to act
He tells me I don't need her that I should walk this path alone
She's make believe, she's up my sleeve
I'd do better with a clone
But could it be, it seems to me, that she's my other half
My inner-Tarzan monkey girl, raised mainly by giraffes
And besides, she makes me laugh
Cause deep down I think she's stupid
But deeper down, I'm just a clown starting bar room brawls with cupid
like, "Fuck that naked baby angel, doll, yo, 2 more buttery nipples"
And God just re-invents herself, as ice-cubes in my ripple</pre>
