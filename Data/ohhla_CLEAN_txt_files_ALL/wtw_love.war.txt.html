[Damon Warwick]
Yo mom, who thought that this could happen

[Dionne]
Nobody but me

[Ray J]
Love is what we need
So if you get that, the blessing will proceed, so please give back

[Big Daddy Kane]
Coming at ya, mob deep on this song
And now it's on
Come together for born
Better yet form Voltron
Spread love like mustard, bust it, making knowledge be born
So trust it, it's B-D-K, learn to love it 

[Dionne Warwick](Chorus)
What the world needs now is love sweet love 

[Flesh Bone]
I know just exactly what world needs now, plead it
Everybody come show a little love for your family, Jesus we need it   And
even when I flip through the pages of my history
Slowly reveal the mystery
Got to get it together quickly, in this industry

[Dionne Warwick]
Lord, we don't need another mountain 
There are mountains and hillsides enough to climb
There are oceans and rivers enough to cross
Enough to last till the end of time 

[Kurupt]
Yo, yo, yo
I could see far and beyond, me and my auntie Dionne
With the homie Fazon, who's cool as freon
As the music plays on, portrays and stays on
Got this thing together, got to get our game together
Life is life and if your ears are open
You could see when you scope doors closed or open
Whether you're in or you're out
You're always in and that's for sure
And that's what friends are for, for what the world needs 

[Dionne Warwick] (Chorus)
What the world needs now is love sweet love
What the world needs now

[Dionne Warwick]
Lord, we don't need another meadow
There are cornfields and wheat fields enough to grow
There are sunbeams and monnbeams enough to shine
Listen Lord, if you want to know 

[Mic G] 
Give me this drug, they call it love
I'd pump it off around the world 
To touch the soul of every man, woman, child, boy and girl

[Royal Flush]
I pray that we could live together on this family tree
Royal Flush and Mic G, we want the world to see

[Big Daddy Kane]
What's happening 
Is the matter when the people traveling 
To grasp a pen and pad and then this united gathering
Keep it on the love, love if you expect the vibe 
Work it out just like an exercise, shame of

[Dionne Warwick] (Chorus)
What the world needs now is love, sweet love
What the world needs no 
Come on can we have unity
Just a little bit of unity, brother
Just a little bit, just a little bit of love baby

[Coolio]
L is for the lies that they told and the lines that they crossed 
When they burglarized my soul, they cold
O is for the outsiders looking in, times is looking grim
You can't even trust your friends, damn
V, cause it's very necessary 
That various policies get variated and eradicated, I hate it
E is for the extra mile you had to walk 
Just to talk to your homie who was locing
And to show him you have love for him. 

[Dionne Warwick]
What the world needs now is love sweet love.
What the world needs now 
It's the only thing that there's just too little of

[Flesh Bone]
We humbly gather together united with almighty power
Ready to rumble at any hour
Got love and it won't let me stumble, follow me

[Dionne Warwick]
What the world needs now is love sweet love.
What the world needs now

[Tyrese] (Fades out)
Can we get together, I'm on my way, baby
Come on get together, unity
We can unify the hip-hop nation</pre>
