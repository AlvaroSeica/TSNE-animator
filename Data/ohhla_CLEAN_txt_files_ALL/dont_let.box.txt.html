Don't let me get on this track
Yeah
Hey Man, what's them things come in cans and gets you drunk?
Thanks man
It's better than being eaten
'Cos its like me all along like O my God
if I was Douglas Adams it's the extension
Man this makes sense if you think I'm God

Yeah but maybe thats what...
Jesus said when he was in serious shit
Like it's someone else and specifically not him
Wondering how something untouchable, remote and scary
I wonder how my Dad be
Looking up like "where the fuck is my ship, man?"
Modern Christians say it's a reasonable scenario
I bluff my way into Taskforce and they'll say "how you know, son, hello"
The parallels are obvious
You can't touch me
But flared shit
I got you firing flares from ships
I listen to beef rap and end up in beef shit
Deep shit why not fucking try
Dude was from my hood he'd spend more time inside the institution then out of it
Wonders why im so obsessed with it
Flashbacks like God put himself in the opposite
But worn like a badge innit
Like no-one else can touch it
There's no smarter guy more courageous in his own special way and I get lesbians calling me a faggot
Major mc's declare outright war, I'm more concerned with stepping on some snails and shit
They say I'm obsessed with them
Man it would be from others but to me it's only of modest interest to me
Deletion of mp3's results in outright war man I paid for that shit
The government are waiting for 153

The government tried to stop me watchin' my tv set
They put posters up on the street sayin I'm dirty
Bastard of Christ yeah
But these subliminals fuckin stress me
I sold a trillion minus one but I'm the equivalent of a blessed mc, only the equivalent
Man I don't like to talk but the human voice hurts me
"Put a beat on" I put on Ennio Morricione
All I want is to hear someone say kennedy bakirioglu â what? on track
But I'm the best and get so startled by a compliment it's funny
But that was tomorrow and I'm from a backwards universe, must be
So can I have the tenner I lent you back next week?
I write these to keep you away from me
Brother did you not know that we are simply competing for the same psychic space?
Fuck with me you don't exist in the past or the future that's why you think u getting thinner and shit
Fuck it me slipping me off fuck fuck like end of a future futurama Roger F Peace
Peace to blistered deviants
Kill me and all I get is a headache..........errrrrrrrr Rog?????
Oh yeah and fucked up for all eternity you get
Hey man get me a beer i'll tell u whos gonna kill Dre and who killed 2pac
They not linked to me
The visionary mc
This clone hurtling towards me
And in 2015 u gonna know what I mean
The Mars lander specifically mentions me
RMF, RMF as a introductional pretext man they know about me
Fuck writing words that rhyme just use the same one
Anyhow babies and rappers are all about me me me me me me
Don't mention Rog in the interplanetary communication
and its irrelevant nah its an irrelevancy
Jimi thought goin' to the moon was weak
Still living got possessed Mustaine during solos on 'Thirteen'
now he's out of the galaxy and scared me
Me
Me pet cats and stuff
Where's Necro when you need a word to rhyme?
Man its like rescuing people on a desert island
that specifically mention me and I get done for it
Yes, I'm a seedy, depraved ex-porn-obsessed
-and-now-i-do-the-opposite-and-probly-cant-even
Ok honey
Hey man what's that shit?

Go really misses Q
By the way I miss superclusters and intergalactic travel
Stuff that Oasis sing about
This world hates me but it wont let me go
My dreams are censored
Keep thinking that if you think you can change it fuck it
I fell out with the ones that were coming
Now I'm in with the ones that are slightly harder slightly comin' slightly after
It's not necessarily got fucking anything to do with you
Em understands this and doesn't like it
McCrack and McCrease and the end of the last shit
Obsessed with it
I never been the same since digitiser dot co dot uk exited teletext
Peace</pre>
