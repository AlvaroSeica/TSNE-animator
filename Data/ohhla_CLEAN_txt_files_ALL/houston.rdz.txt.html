(Chorus: Russell Lee)
Sometimes I feel like I don't have a problem
Sometimes I feel like my only fear
Is the city I live in, the city of Houston
Lonely as I am, together we ride

[Happy P]
These motherfuckers be hating on me, and they hating on us
Cause our city's moving up, it's over what what
Well you can suck my dick, you can thank a nigga when
Cause we gone bring it to your ass fa sho what, huh

[Rasheed]
Uh 59 I-10, forty five
Six to the 88, hitting all sides
We all ride, the city ain't a small tie
Wanna explore, well let me be your tour guide

[Max Minelli]
Cadillac pure coat, white pearl
When I pull out, they swear I'm moving white girl
But I ain't with that, I make sick beats
I hit my homie Toe Roll blowing big sweets

[Grimm]
In the Southeast telephone rolling on drop
Sitting at the light like I got a knot on the side
I'm gone punch it once it turn green
Let my rubber burn clean like it done served me

(Chorus)

[Low G]
Me and my flow, flow for my dough
Ride so clean 54 when I come to the show
Deuce double O, deuce is my word, word is my derb
You fuck with the move and you'll be done with desert

[Baby Beesh]
Well now the po-po's won't leave my ass alone
I'm on the 6-10 loop by the Astro Dome
I'm in the city where them laws get tough enough
Pulled over with a pocket of that fluffy-fluff

[SPM]
Man, my kind I'm as pure as the snow
And my words stay way below zero
All my life I been different, niggas telling me it's cool
But partner it really isn't

[Max Minelli]
I'm coming down from the booth cause I'm sick with this
And me and Russ fin to flip down the Richmond strip
Up in Sharpstown, ma buying t's and Nikes
At the light sitting clean on d's and whites

(Chorus)

[Grimm]
On Ferrisberg and Wingside, in the daylight
You can bet a thug moving bud like a hay ride
Same guy, might move and turn to you
Within another boo, we be shitting in front of you

[Happy P]
Man I wasn't born here but it sure feel like home
And all across the motherfucking state we known
From Alpasso to Beaumont, you know who won fools
I'm 59 blowing smoke out the sunroof

[Rasheed]
Uh huh, we get the more down cheap in the sector
Worldwide, Wet Black like onector
It's the myates speaking different languages
Changing shit, breaking bricks in the city mix

[Low G]
Then if I will, then if I won't
Catch me running downtown in the Screwston
Them boys in the hood, yeah save make 'em noisy
I'm good with these hands I got aim with this dose

(Chorus)</pre>
