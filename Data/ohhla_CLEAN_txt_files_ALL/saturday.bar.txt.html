[Chorus: Tim Armstrong]
Every night is a Saturday night
Every night is a Saturday night
Every night is a Saturday night
Saturday night for me

[Tim Armstrong]
Inner city boulevard, broken and neglected
When the sun sets, expect the unexpected
Listen to me closely, I'm a straight shooter
Met a policeman who, calls himself a looter
Met this girl named Sasiko, in the naked city
Things can go so very wrong, city or no pity
Good and evil split, it's a two-way tour
Too late now, the devil's knockin at my door

[Chorus]

[Skinhead Rob]
I see things a little different through the blood in my eyes
And though you mighta fooled them others I see through your disguise
I rise, I'm gettin by, no lies, I'm gettin high
And I ain't worried 'bout the next, you can bet I'm gettin mine
With this mirror by the cord and O.G. by the zip
My old lady got my side, and my chrome on my hip
We hit the freeway flyin, 21 in the front
Cheatin death, but I know the reaper's still on the hunt
So what?

[Chorus]

[Tim Armstrong]
Always movin uhh, town to town
Ain't never gon', slow us down
Never let up, never subside
I'm sick of bull, born to ride

[Skinhead Rob]
I got a monkey on my back, it's a constant reminder
Lets me know I need to let it go, there ain't no survivors
Still I'm, I'm sayin fuck it, roll it, I'm gettin higher
Though my lungs and my liver beggin me to retire
Nope~!

[Chorus]
