It's murda(Yo it's murda)...niggaz it's murda(Niggaz it's murda)
It's murda(Yo it's murda)...niggaz it's murda(Niggaz it's murda)

[Chorus: Chink Santana]
It's murda, you know when we come
Niggaz it's murda, ain't nowhere to hide
It's murda, ain't no where to run
Niggaz it's murda, I-N-C is gon ride tonight
It's murda, ain't nowhere to run
Niggaz it's murda, ain't nowhere to hide
It's murda, you know when we come
Niggaz it's murda, I-N-C gon ride tonight

[Chink Santana]
I'm from the city where the good die young and
Niggaz strugglin, drugs smuglin, youngins and keep the slugs cuplin
Hustlin hard, niggaz cussin guard for they scars
To many niggaz in the back of them cars
It like a bird dead trapped in them bars
But it ain't no thang, I got cookies change
And fame just a way of making plans
Ho's been hollerin my name (Santana)
I never been fuckin wit no snitches still
Quick wit barettas, wit hammers quick to get wit ya
Now a nigga hit up, clipped up
And real motherfucker know we all about stackin those digits
The reason I spit these lyrics bitches is to bring the word to the district
Who is it?
How to get connected comin from that gritty city
When nothin but a grind, and no time to rhyme
And my nigga D.O. visit
And you don't really wanna fuck wit Chink
And I don't even get a chance to blink
When I catch a lil' third nigga jumpin out the escalade
Iced out wit a black mink (Blingin lingin)
And to my niggaz wonderin why they can't find me
And why come by when they come by kid
Cuz I be up in the wide city wit I.G., Biiiitch

[Chorus: Chink Santana]
It's murda, you know when we come
Niggaz it's murda, ain't nowhere to hide
It's murda, ain't no where to run
Niggaz it's murda, I-N-C is gon ride tonight
It's murda, ain't nowhere to run
Niggaz it's murda, ain't nowhere to hide
It's murda, you know when we come
Niggaz it's murda, I-N-C gon ride tonight

[D.O. Cannon]
You gon get grown now, wit bitches so loud
Go get your chrome clow, your brain get blown out
Playa listen your forgettin to slippin to get your grind on
When we comin hittin, spittin your times gone
You know it's murda this should have told ya
Cuz a soilder, watch when I roll up
Heavy hittas, heavin spittin you want us? come get us
Natural born killers, now you feel us girl
Shot is flyin, no autumn ridin, you keep on hidin
Nigga put your time in
D.O. Cannon known for makin it happen
Trucks pull up we pop off boy what's crackin, you heard!
You know my crew it dirty, stay out my bentley shorty
You got that money show me, befo' I pop ya homey
Gotti is cool, niggaz is straight fools
Thinkin you tough dude, look what the inc do
Roll up!

[Chorus: Chink Santana]
It's murda, you know when we come
Niggaz it's murda, ain't nowhere to hide
It's murda, ain't no where to run
Niggaz it's murda, I-N-C is gon ride tonight
It's murda, ain't nowhere to run
Niggaz it's murda, ain't nowhere to hide
It's murda, you know when we come
Niggaz it's murda, I-N-C gon ride tonight

[Caddillac Tah]
Yeah, nigga watch out murda burner fo'-sho
Wit that New York city ??? out
Gritty ??? ???, semi charged out, remi car swirved
In and out of lanes
So we thuggin and hustlin, pistol lover wit alot of aim
Put it up and pop up your frame
Betta watch the game
Cuz we here to take it, ain't a nigga gon make us get sidetracked
From this paper, we fire gats
Put it in end wit tai cats
And that shit you decribe as rap
Is my life and I'll ride wit that
Mean wit ross wit the baby mack
Bitches be lovin the way we act
In the club when it's crazy packed
From Atlanta to Cacilac
Who the fuck wanna fuck wit that? Hit him a bad position
where his moma gon see homey spillin blood on the curb
Sayin they last words
The undispuited under dog
And we comin wit all intentions to win and crush em all
If you see I.G. nigga respect the master boss
When we ride (Ain't no where to run, ain't where to hide)
Somebody gotta die *Echo's out*

[Chorus: Chink Santana]
It's murda, you know when we come
Niggaz it's murda, ain't nowhere to hide
It's murda, ain't no where to run
Niggaz it's murda, I-N-C is gon ride tonight
It's murda, ain't nowhere to run
Niggaz it's murda, ain't nowhere to hide
It's murda, you know when we come
Niggaz it's murda, I-N-C gon ride tonight

[Chink Santana]
Y'all bet is to not fuck wit this
Cuz we're drunk niggaz ride (Repeat 4x)</pre>
