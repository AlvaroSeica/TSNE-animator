[Intro: Pitbull]
Mr. Worldwide!
Mami no you can't come down
No mami no you can't come down
Cause you look so right {*8X*}
Pause...

[Chorus]
Now go - stop! Drop it, pause... {*2X*}
Oh, look at that girl, she's like ah
Look at that girl, she's like oh
Look at that girl, she's like ah
Look at that girl, she's like

[Pitbull]
Look, I got what you need to get you hooked
I ste-al your heart, I'm a crook
Want Friday night?
I'm sorry, I'm booked
Brooke, Maria y la amiga de ella
Tan rica en la cama no juegan
Explotan y dicen pause...

[Chorus]

[Pitbull]
Hey, mamita would you like to play?
Would love to see where you stay
And if you say, okay
We will play night and day
I'm such a dirty dirty dog
My teeth will unsnap your bra
But for now baby just
Pause...

[Chorus]

[repeat 2X]
Mami yo it is so tight, mami yo it is so tight
She got what I like (what I like) what I like (what I like)

[Pitbull]
Mami yo it is so tight, mami yo it is so tight
She got what I like (what I like) pause...

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Oh, look at that girl, she's like ah
Look at that girl, she's like oh
Look at that girl, she's like ah
Look at that girl, she's like...
Pause...
