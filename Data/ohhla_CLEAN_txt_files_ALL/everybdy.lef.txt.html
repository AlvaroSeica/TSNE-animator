[Jake Lefco]
This is for everybody breathin, cause everybody's fiendin
for a reason to relax, for some music to believe in
I'm here to feed 'em, this form of freedom
It's more to me than, normally needed to succeed and
more to see than, what's on the screen and, I want to see it
Reveal it, and feel it, cause I'm a realist
And I can't deal with the mis..leading proceedings
The meaningless greetings, folks goin through the motions with no feelings
No, really, don't gimme that, indirect dilly dab
Beat around the bush crap, that's what I look past
Like clean glass, keepin me heated like a steam bath
Keep the sugar coating, I don't need that
Keep that in mind, you'll be fine with me
I'm not a thug, I never was, and I'm not tryin to be - it's not me
I'm not above it, I'm not tryin to preach - it's not me
I just speak from what I think, what I know and what I see

[Chorus]
This is for everybody breathin, cause everybody's fiendin
for a reason to relax, for some music to believe in
  "You listening?" "Oh yeah" "Nobody's listening"
  "I'm listening~!" Okay, okay okay listen"
This is for everybody breathin, cause everybody's fiendin
for a reason to relax, for some music to believe in
  "Let's relax for a moment, okay?"
  "Take a deep breath"

[Jake Lefco]
I say the first thing that moves me to speak, release the beast
Lose me, refuse to let logic confuse me
Knowledge is not just books, it's in the woods
It's in the hood, it's on a subway train, it's in the Brook'
Look, it's in the mirror, in the bad and the good
Listen, it's in the voices of the misunderstood
Listen, it's in the system, it's in the anti-war resistance
Listen, it's in the politician
It's in the schools and the prisons, the Jews and the Christians
Mathematicians and magicians
I keep my distance from those who won't listen
Those who keep insistin they know it all
Frigid and cold and all rigid, fear is all it is
Business is business, but this shit is personal
The illness is terminal, and hard to watch
Like seein a man get his ass kicked it's hard to stop
This is for everybody, anybody, all the spots
Play me in your box, the neighbors call the cops
You need a reason to relax, I give you all I got
Music, and I don't care who thinks I'm wrong or not

[Chorus] - different quotes in lines 3-4

[Jake Lefco]
Forgive me if it's too deep, if I don't let it out I'm gonna lose sleep
Instead I run my mouth 'til I lose teeth
Even that's fixable, physical appearance just isn't that critical
Obsession in the U.S.
Young bucks stressin cause they gotta get the new kicks
Some sell drugs while some parents couldn't do less
That's how it is I guess, it isn't that direct
It isn't my business, bear witness to neglect
I don't have the answers, got a handful of questions
I throw against the wall, see which stick and which fall
All stressin aside, we need an outlet
Find where the pressure's applied and let it out quick
That goes for white black yellow and brown
Cause everybody breathin needs mellowin down
And everybody breathin needs medicine now
That's the music to believe in so I'm settin it down
