[Master P] 
Shake it from the south from the north to the east 
Twerk it to the west from the club to the street 

[Chorus] 
Shake that thang, twerk that thang wobble that thang, 
let it bounce, let it swing 
Shake what your mama gave ya, you look good dats why they hate ya 

[Verse 1] 
Your probally mixed with coyotes the way that ass be shaking 
Put tht hump in your back and you and your girl trade places 
Then drop it like it's hot,shake it till they pop 
in the back of the club from the bottom to the top 
I've been fiending a little but see I'm ready for that 
Bend over touchyour toes let that minkie out that dress 
No panties, no thong I might take you home 
We could do right,or we could do wrong 
Where the thug girls at,you might get down 
We gotta couple, a lotta we might throw 'em up around 
Cuz them girls be actin bad,on the dance floor shakin ass 
In the club whodie getting in cash 
ballin them gouches in No Limit bags 

  [Chorus 2x] 

[Verse 2: Master P] 
Bodies on chrome,tattoos on my arm 
My boonopolisat the tele, my babooski at home 
I'm bout to act a donkie 
I like choclate like brown, but a trompak 
Wit curves like a coke bottle 
I mean thick like a stallion, but pretty like a super model 
Make the waiter drop the drinks 
Make a cripple old man take ruffle to the bank 
She'll shake it in the morning, shake it in the evening 
I don't play Georgia if she can play wheezing 
Ride it like a bike, twerk it all night 
Grab the wall from the left to the right 

 [Chorus 2 X] 
  
[Master P talking] 
I dont care what they say 
You been up in the club getting ur paper forever 
You look good babooski and the way that thing shaking, 
you look like a country stallion, YA HEARD ME 
Two balls in your back pocket, 
you could bounce that thing all the way to the top 
HOLD UP WAIT A MINUTE THEM NO LIMT BOYZ WE BACK UP IN IT 

[CHORUS 2X] </pre>
