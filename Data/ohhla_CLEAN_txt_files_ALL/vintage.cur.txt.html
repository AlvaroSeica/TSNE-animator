[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Uh
Open fire places
Me and my lady back home from a wine tasting
The scene was crazy, millionaires of all shades and trades exchanging jokes
Helicopters chopping as we smoke
Plotting on a way to get this cash cow roped up and tied down
Snipers outside my compound
Inside we pow wow been doing this for some time now
Andretti most slept on like yo big homies couch
I'm from New Orleans you'll get crept on and X'd out
And we like damn we was just talking to homie
Stretched EMS threw them covers on him
But them children already seen it
3 in the morning woke his whole family up with that screaming
Visions of hits, niggas dying living in shit
I'm just writing 'bout it, lighting my exotic
Call it like 8 ball corner pocket, drop it

[Interlude]
[Don Corleone] My wife is crying upstairs. I hear cars coming to the house
[Tom Hagen] I was just about to come up and wake you so that I could tell you
[Don Corleone] But you needed a drink first. And now you've had your drink
[Tom Hagen] They shot Sonny on the causeway. He's dead

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
Uh
Real niggas have died over a bitches lives
I know my brother would ride if ever, but never
The corporation grow forever even when I'm gone
Play my shit and light yo bong
Life goes on
We family I'm there for you, right or wrong?
They gon' have to get us all the same way dog
[?] sunroof top, the doja in the wind
Momma it don't stop you know you tryna get in
Dipping up the block with a G like him
These is rare events...
To live another way doesn't make sense

[Outro: The Godfather]
[Don Corleone] I want no inquiries made. I want no acts of vengeance
I want you to arrange a meeting, with the heads of the Five Families...</pre>
