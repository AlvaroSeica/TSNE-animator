(*talking*)
Laff-Tex street game, (yeah yeah)
Southside Playaz in your brain
You now listening to the original Papa Reu (that's right)
And I'm putting it down for Laff-Tex Records
And right chere with me (Mr. 3-2), I got my boy K.B. and Flea
Lil' Keke, Mike D, and you know I'm keeping it real on this one
Cause you know the game is strange
But we gonna make it joy for real, come down

[Lil' Flea]
Who wanna ride on a get money mission, well hop inside
When Boss Dogg get the dropper see, we all tired
Getting fetty in this game, so heavy back on the rise
Shaking the dodge, in this game alive
The way we roll it's so outta control, when money folds
The cars are rented, the windows are tinted you know what's in it
My mob be camouflage, bullet hole niggaz cards
I got killers behind bars, that cut like swords
But it's all love, cause we all thugs
Went from teenage scrubs, to front page punks
Anything less than real, I'ma chill
I put that on a house on the hill, with hundred dollar bills
Cause I'm leaving my fingerprints, in this rap game
If you ain't a hundred percent, pick up your slack mayn
Cause if your aim ain't the game, you gon' feel all the pain
And the shame that it bring, cause this game is strange

[Chorus: Papa Reu - 2x]
The game is strange, but it look so clean
It's like Papa Reu, be popping up on the scene
Cause you know that the dollars, know we all gon' make it
And that we never never gonna stop it

[K.B.]
I been living in the last days
When you will die, before you get a chance to see a old age
This how it is in the ghetto, stay away from the devil
If you ain't ready to die, never listen to a lie
They be telling them all over the world, trying to sell you a dream
I'm player made for life, give me the cash the cream
Don't try to play me like no dope fiend
I get to popping get to chopping, niggaz brain cells
We deep up in the streets, we got war stories to tell
Of how you get murdered then buried, the cemetery is full of my homies
I keep running from the devil, the devil don't wanna see me regard
The devil want me to pick up the nine and blast
Yeah my finger throb, living in United States of America ghetto is hard
This a everyday job, feel me coming from the dope and every corner I stand on
Where I was born, well I'ma be here till I die

[Chorus - 2x]

[Lil' Keke]
I been blessed with success, young nigga with finesse
How many wanna test, I impress the best
Seven figgas nothing less, I annihilate the rest
Get all up in they chest, with these lyrics I possess
From the South to the West, how the hell can they knock it
Got a million dollar profit, six digits in my pocket
How can they stop it, it's a funky expedition
Got a hellafied position, I'd die for the Commission
Rich niggaz hard heads, how many wanna ride
Got niggaz that'll die, got niggaz that'll fry
I'm a star from the sky, Lil' Keke's the name
Better check the game when I wreck the game, ain't no way I'ma change
Maintain the fame, I highly recommend it
Nationwide distribution, plus I'm independent
Everything's looking splendid, plus I never say never
It's the general invincible, in this game forever

[Chorus - 4x]</pre>
