[Hook]
Your love has left me wide open
Your love has left me wide open
Your love has left me wide open
Your love has left me, I don't wanna close the door

How could you leave me here all alone
How could you pretend to be home
How could I lead myself to believe you were here
When you proved me wrong
Every time
How could I be so blind and naive
How'd you keep the truth up your sleeve
How could you let your love turn around in a moment
So short I had no time to bleed wit 'cha

[Hook] - 2X

How could you let me go all the way
How could you ignore when I say
Your love is built for every day and the light was meant to forever shine
Why did I let my heart go
So easily it led me astray
The way I felt your temperature change
Oh, my summer has turned to winter in my mind

[Hook] - 2X

[Bridge - 2X]
Keep movin', keep movin', keep movin'
Gotta keep movin', keep movin', keep movin'
Man, wha chu doin', you doin', you doin'
Gotta keep movin', keep movin', keep movin'

[Hook] - 2X</pre>
