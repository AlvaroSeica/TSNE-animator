What cha gonna do wit all that junk
All that junk inside your trunk

[Fergie]
I'm gonna get-get-get-get you drunk
Get you love drunk of my hump

[Fergie - 2nd verse]
I drive these brothers crazy
I do it on the daily
They treat me really nicely
They buy me all these ice-ys

Fendi and then Donna
Karan, they be sharin
All their money got me wearin
Fly gearrr but I ain't askin
They say they love my ass 'n
Se7en Jeans, True Religion
I say no, but they keep givin
So I keep on takin
And no I ain't taken
We can keep on datin
I keep on demonstrating

[Fergie]/[Will.I.Am]

[Will.I.Am]
I met a girl down at the disco
She said "Hey, hey, hey you let's go
I could be your baby, you can be my honey
Let's spend time, not money
And mix your milk with my coco puffs
Milky, milky coco
Mix your milk with my coco puffs
Milky, milky riiiiiggght"

[Fergie]
They say I'm really sexy
The boys all want to sex me
They always standing next to me
Always dancing next to me
Tryin' to feel my hump, hump
Lookin' at my lump, lump
You can look
But chu can't touch it
If you touch it, I'm-ah
Start some drama
You don't want no drama
No, no drama
No, no, no drama
So don't pull on my hand, boy
You ain't my man, boy
I'm just tryin' to dance, boy
And move my hump

[Fergie]/[Will.I.Am]

My lovely lady lumps (3x)

Oh, spending all your money on me
And spending time on me
(She got me spending)
Oh, spending all your money on me, ah-on me
On me
