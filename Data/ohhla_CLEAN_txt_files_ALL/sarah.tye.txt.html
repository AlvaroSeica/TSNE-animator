[Tyler, the Creator]
I like my girls skinny, with brains
I like my hoodies fucked, with lame
I like my friends imaginary with no names
and I make music for the fuck of it, no fame
Aim, shoot, the gun, of love, round
Tried to find ammo but it's none around town
So I went down South but I ended up North
Uptown sittin on cloud 9's white porch
And of course, my car's off course
You're so white, my blinkers don't work
I'm tryin to let the force be with you, I get you
Music is my first, but I contemplate divorce
You make a nigga sing songs nice
You make a nigga nighttime day
And you make the flowers sing say turn green yellow
It sucks that I didn't get the chance to say hello
(HI~!) I want to eat you out like Jello
And mess with your body like the bass and the cello
And tell your mom I said hello
You want to go to prom? (Nigga hell no)
Fuck (shit) and another one
There goes another one
(Tyler the Creator, O.F.)

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Another love song about shit
And I'll be rich if I get another diss
Or maybe Cupid won't miss (BLAOW!)

[Interlude]
Baby (no)
Baby (I'm sorry)
Baby (I got a date)
Baby (whatever)

[Tyler, the Creator]
I like her L-I-K-E
The only difference is she won't fuck with me
But she will fuck with that Vegetable
with her hairs full of X and O's
I want to tie her body up and throw her in my basement
Keep her there so nobody can wonder where her face went
(Tyler, what are you...?) Shut the fuck up!
Shut up, you gonna fuckin love me bitch
or I'ma fuckin put this gun in your fuckin head
But all I really want is a kiss on the cheek
in private, not public in the streets
And your cupcake how we eat and your toes
cause I got a big fetish with the feet
I just want somebody I can see
You can be a gold digger, you ain't got to love me
I'm serious (I love you) I don't axe for much
Your heart literally is what I do want for lunch
(You're gonna kill me!) Now this shit is turnin to a habit
I'm the Burger King, I gotta have it my way
and truthfully, girl you really make my day
I would probably kill myself if you told me you was gay
And I can't even look the other way
Your aura is a magnet, my eyes a metal bag
It's attracting, L-O-L laughing
You're a gold Oscar and I'm just acting
And I want your cinema hole
and have our kids play supporting role
Climbing up the pole
Jack and the Beanstalk, bitch it's gold
And I was in loath
I would never get over you
ever, Sarah

[Chorus]

[Tyler, the Creator]
You're my lady, you taste so good {*sirens*}
Oh baby, be my baby, O.F., forever
I loved you, Sarah

Half your body layin on my chest
the rest is in my stomach, that's includin your breast
And I'ma just take another guess
Now you probably wishin that you would have said yes
Am I crazy? Maybe
But fucked up is how I been lately
Shit, I don't give a fuck
Your family lookin for you, wish 'em good luck
Bitch, you tried to play me like a dummy
Now you stuck up in my motherfuckin basement all bloody
And I'm fuckin your dead body, your coochie all cummy
Looking in your dead eyes, what the fuck you want from me?
What did you want from me?
What did you want from me?

I gave you everything, but {*knocking*}
guess I wasn't the one (this is the police!)
(Open the door) I don't know (you God damn)
(know you're surrounded) Well (fucker)
(Open up or we'll barge in, right in)
{*click-clack*} BLAOW!!</pre>
