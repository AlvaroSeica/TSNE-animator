[Intro: Dave Storrs]
KILLERS!! KILLERS!! KILLERS!! KILLERS!! KILLERS!! 
KILLERS!! KILLERS!! KILLERS!! KILLERS!! KILLERS!! 
KILLERS!! KILLERS!! KILLERS!! KILLERS!! KILLERS!! 

[Ice-T]
A man seen this Ad on T.V.
To enroll in the Police Academy
He's very talented and outstanding with proof
From his clean-cut appearance, to the shine on his boots
When it comes to graduation, he's number one
An expert with the Rifle and also a gun
Three weeks on the beat, his weak nerves cracked
And fired four warning shots into a kid's back (*Gun Shots*)

[Chorus: Ice-T]
KILLERS!! - These are the killers
KILLERS!! - The coldhearted killers
KILLERS!! - Bloodthirsty killers
KILLERS!! - Beware of the killers

[Ice-T]
A young girl marries an older man
With more money than you could understand 
He smothered her with pearls and jewelry
And they both seemed as happy as they could be
But three months later, she's sad but content
Seems he had an unexpected accident
The girl said he would be hard to forget
As the papers interviewed her while she flew his jet

[Chorus: Ice-T]
KILLERS!! - These are the killers
KILLERS!! - She was the killer
KILLERS!! - The coldhearted killers
KILLERS!! - Beware of the killers
It's time for all to work together for peace
Cause everybody's doomed, if the killings don't cease
Street homicide, war, it's all the same
Cause murder is murder by any name
KILLERS!! KILLERS!! KILLERS!!

[Ice-T]
A young man loses his only job
Too proud to hustle, too honest to rob
He goes to tell his family and his wife
But an argument breaks out, she grabs a knife
Tempers escalate into a total rage
Shots burst out from a loaded twelve-gauge
They called that Mass Murder, Suicide!
BUT SOMEBODY TELL ME WHY THE KIDS HAD TO DIE?

[Chorus: Ice-T]
KILLERS!! - These are the killers
KILLERS!! - The coldhearted killers
KILLERS!! - Bloodthirsty killers
KILLERS!! - Beware of the killers

[Ice-T]
Vietnam vet, home from the war
Can't get a job in a candy store
Unemployment hurts in his living proof
So to take out his frustration, he climbs on the roof
He shows no pity as victims are shot
The only thing to stop him is a bullet from SWAT
Ten people died on a sunny day
BUT TELL ME WHO TAUGHT HIM HOW TO SHOOT THAT WAY?

[Chorus: Ice-T]
KILLERS!! - These are the killers
KILLERS!! - You know the killers
KILLERS!! - Beware of the killers
KILLERS!! - Are you a killer?
It's time for all to work together for peace
Cause everybody's doomed, if the killings don't cease
Street homicide, war, it's all the same
Cause murder is murder by any name
KILLERS!! KILLERS!! 

[Ice-T]
A known criminal is sentenced to death
Now the legal system controls his last breath
He tries to fight execution with petitions and pleas
And a pardon from the governor is all he needs
He cries out for mercy, but nothing's spared
And on his day of termination, he's strapped in a chair
High voltage hits his body and the hounds sliced him
And all of the people of vengeance grin

[Chorus: Ice-T]
Are you a killer? - A coldheart killer?
A KILLER!! - A bloodthirsty killer?
A KILLER!! - A merciless killer?
A KILLER!! A KILLER!! A KILLER!!

[Ice-T]
Georgie-Porgy-Pudding-and-pie
Couldn't get a girl, let me tell you all why
He tried to be down like all the rest
Had curls in his hair, gold on his chest
He rolled around town in a Coupé Deville
But he had no money, he was broke as hell
Ladies love money and he needed more
So he tried to steal something from a Liquor Store
But before Georgie-Porgie could get away
The man pulled out his gun and blew him away

[Chorus: Ice-T]
He was a killer, a coldheart killer
A KILLER!! - Are you a killer? 
A KILLER!! - A merciless killer?
A KILLER!! - Beware of the killers
It's time for all to work together for peace
Cause everybody's doomed, if the killings don't cease
Street homicide, war, it's all the same
Cause murder is murder by any name
KILLERS!! KILLERS!! 

[Ice-T]
Politicians plus theirs power each and every day
We are all just puppets in the games they play
They manipulate the masses to obtain their goals
And for simple re-election they will sell their souls
Nuclear Supremacy is the ultimate thrill
So our taxes we pay and pay for overkill
Bureau of Bombers' super weapons, rockets in the sky
WHILE WE ALL PRAY TO GOD THE MISSILES NEVER FLY

[Chorus: Ice-T]
KILLERS!! - These are the killers
KILLERS!! - They are killers
KILLERS!! - Are you a killer?
KILLERS!! - Don't be a killer
It's time for all to work together for peace
Cause everybody's doomed, if the killings don't cease
Street homicide, war, it's all the same
Cause murder is murder by any name

[Outro: Dave Storrs until faded]
KILLERS!! KILLERS!! KILLERS!! KILLERS!! KILLERS!! 
KILLERS!! KILLERS!! KILLERS!! KILLERS!! KILLERS!! 
KILLERS!! KILLERS!! KILLERS!! KILLERS!! KILLERS!!</pre>
