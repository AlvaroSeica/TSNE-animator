(Now I got to cut ya...) <scratches quik="" quik...="" too="" w="">
Yeah ha ha that's right. 'Cause it's like this
Yeah, it's gotta be like this. Nigga.

Verse 1
It used to be a CPT thang (what)
but now it's just an all me thang (yeah)
because I'm tired of this gizame (right)
I'm through playin' for a crew
that ain't got my back
when I'm the one who done
created the sack
Mister You Know Who remember me
I met you when I was P.P.C.
and you wadn't nothin' but a scrub
wearin' plaid pants and bubble gums
and beggin' for grub
and then when ya hips start growin'
you tripped and flipped and skipped out
know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Not even thinkin' 'bout the times
when Kay Kay took yo' ass in
'cause you didn't have a dime
Nigga couldn't even say thanks for the trouble
I would've spanked yo' ass on the double
'Cause when ya didn't have a place to stay
you little round the way girl
my nigga took yo' way
and that way all my homies had yo' back
Because together they knew we had a fat ass sack
but you couldn't stand the guns
Couldn't wait to take ya
<bitch betta="" have="" my=""> (AMG)
money and run
Kay Kay should've knew the motto of life (what's that)
that ya can't turn a hoe into a housewife (ha ha)
Because you left a lot of people unhappy nigga
You in debt and ya need to get at me

Chorus
I'm gonna let ya know it (that's right)
I'm gonna let ya know it (so ya need to get at me)
I'm gonna let ya know it (huh)
I'm gonna let ya know it (you need to get at me)

Verse 2
Now I can name a gang of niggas I done tripped with
spent a grip with and they ain't spent shit
and they ain't never brought nothing to the table
But it ain't no puzzle I'm able
but why you wanna take my kindness for weakness
To get my money back
I gotta ride yo' ass like Preakness
it ain't that fly
and when ya see me in traffic just ride by
You should've been a pigeon
'cause you duck so well
but next time I catch you I'ma pluck yo' tail
'Cause niggas like y'all show disrespect
by flossin' so you in for a tossin'
You need to go brush your teeth
and change ya drawers and change ya sheets
and stop y'alls bitches
from steadily tryin' ta ride on my mink
And start bathing more than once a week (nigga)
You know who I'm talkin' 'bout bitches
so ya needs to come right with a quickness (come right)
and instead of tryin' to duck and dodge
and be crafty you need to get at me.

Chorus
I'm gonna let ya know it (hell yeah)
I'm gonna let ya know it (you need to get at me)
I'm gonna let ya know it (that's right)
I'm gonna let ya know it (you need to get at me)

Verse 3
So tell me how we gon' handle this
either we gon' be men or we gon' be scandalous
either way is all right with me
'Cause I'ma show ya that I meant it
when I said that I'm a G Nigga
I don't take ganks too swell (naw)
that's why I went and bought a gang of shells
and if you approach me wrong
I'ma clown first nigga run up <gunshot>
 "First down."
Damn I wish it didn't even have to come to this
'cause now y'alls on my shit list
right with the white boys in this game
thinkin' they gone get the hits for some chump change
Please huh I didn't believe that you'll trip like that
that's how a gang of niggas flipped like that
so get back fool 'cause I'm going out
comin' out of a straight jacket Blastin'!! <gunshot>
and they gon' have to get at me

Chorus
I'm gonna let you know it. (hell yeah)
I'm gonna let you know it. (you need to get at me)
I'm gonna let you know it.
I'm gonna let you know it. (you know what
y'all can never get at me)

Now battle
