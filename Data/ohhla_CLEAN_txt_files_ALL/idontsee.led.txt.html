[Intro: Birdman]
Yeah (2 Chainz!)
5000 on the lens
Perpetratin on these niggaz (bigger than life)
Uhh, fo'sho {DJ KHALED~!}

[Chorus: 2 Chainz]
If I stand next to ice, then I'm camouflaged
If I stand next to lights, then I'm camouflaged
My future's so bright, that all I see is stars
My shades on in the club, I don't see you broads
I don't see you broads, I don't-I don't see you broads
I don't see you broads, I don't-I don't see you broads
My future's so bright, that all I see is stars
My shades on in the club, I don't see you broads

[2 Chainz]
I'm +Criminal, Minded+ winter coat cli-mate
Cold, fuckin up yo' sinus
Bitches might choke, I'm givin them the Heimlich
I'm a, pimp in my own fuckin rhymin you my side bitch
Ungh - 2 Chainz, two pinky rings
I like to play with +Lucilles+, +B.B. King+
You don't fuck with us, we don't really fuck with y'all
Stunna bought some Yachts, We in the ocean playing bumper cars
Pocket full of money, bitch, and my crew eatin
Got a nigga shinin like a brand new nickel
Plated pistol, this my last shot
Just left the dealership and I cashed out

[Chorus]

[Ace Hood]
Black shades, gold chain, and a Versace scarf
Swear you haters couldn't see me if I glowed in the dark
What it be like nigga? What it look like hoe?
Still shinin a nigga, 2 Chainz lookin like it's lightnin doe
No love for you busters, consistently stuntin
Mo' bottles of Rose, yeah you know who run it
Thousand dollar shades on, all gold frames
Mister Fuck-Your-Bitch-And-Leave-Her, that's my code name
I'm blowin money in this bitch, I think I'm Birdmane
Trappin ain't dead, gettin money like the bird mane
B-B-Bad bitches, whole lotta ass
Make you famous in this bitch soon as the camera flash

[Chorus]

[Birdman]
Yeah... yeah
In the kitchen and we cookin up that raw hog
Driveway shini, I'm a movie star
Open up the bank bitch, bring 'em large
Flip 'em and we bust 'em, then we ship 'em off
Perpetratin'll get your head bust
A hundred million'll get you dope flush
A new Bentley, you get a hoe rush
Big money shit, we poppin cause we came up
Hella choppers, on them new thangs
Big yachts, brand new wings
Them hoes floppin cause they know the frame
Cartier, 10 karats on my pinky ring

[Chorus]

[Birdman]
Yeah~! Just like that my nigga
Dark room, tinted shades on
The GT poppin
In the club get in my zone, backroom
V.I.P., people, yeah
Y.M.C.M.B. flashin lifestyle
Whattup Detail? Yeah
I rock to this one my nigga, let's get it</pre>
