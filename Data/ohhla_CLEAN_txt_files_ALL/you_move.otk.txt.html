[Big Boi]
Booom, booom, booom..

Ready for action, nip it in the bud
We never relaxin, OutKast is everlastin
Not clashin, not at all
But see my nigga went to do a little actin
Now that's for anyone askin, give me one pass 'em
Drip drip drop, there goes an eargasm
Now you cumin out the side of your face
We tappin right into your memory banks - thanks!
So click-it-or-ticket, let's see your seat belt fastened
Trunk rattlin, like two midgets in the backseat rasslin'
Speakerboxxx vibrate the tag
Make it sound like aluminum cans in a bag
But I know y'all wanted that 808
Can you feel that B-A-S-S bass?
But I know y'all wanted that 808
Can you feel that B-A-S-S bass?

[Chorus: Sleepy Brown]
I like the way you move..
I like the way you move.. whoo!
I love the way you move..
I love the way, I love the way
I love the way you move..
I love the way you move.. whoo!
I love the way you move..
I love the way, I love the way

[Big Boi]
The whole room fell silent, the girls all paused with glee
Turnin left, turnin right, are they lookin at me?
Well I was lookin at them, there there on the dancefloor
Now they got me in the middlin, feelin like a man-whore
.. 'specially the big girl
Big guls need love too, no discrimination here squirrel
So keep your hands off my cheeks
Let me study how you ride the beat, you big freak
Skinny slim women got the cameltoe within them
You can hump them, lift them, bend them, give them
something to remember, yell out
timber when you fall through the chop shop
Take a deep breath an exhale
Your ex-male friend boyfriend's borin as hell
But let me listen to the story you tell
And we can make moves like a person in jail, on the low hoe

[Chorus]

[Sleepy Brown]
Hey baby, girl don't you stop it
Come on lady, dance all around me
You look so fine (look so fine) look so fine
You drivin me out my mind (out of my mind)
Out my mind, ooooh baby
If I could I would just be with you baaa-by
Oooh cause you light me, and excite me
And you know, you got me baby, whoo!

[Chorus] w/ ad libs - repeat to fade</pre>
