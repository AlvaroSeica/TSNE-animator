[Chorus]
Break down, the walls in your head, until you
Breakdown, not tears instead, you need a
Break, down on your page and pen, state it's you to really hold a
Break - down on stage

I'm talkin... ta ta tata ta
I'm talkin feelin' every single one of you in this room
I'm talkin knowing I'm feeling I have my right to this mic
Feel it, you feel it the dealer's deal has been sealed, it's alright
The flow will keep comin for real, it's alright
And see I'm not like every other motherfuck with a mic
I'm on my own (Doomtree)
Feel like the, feel like the words are comin'
Feel like the style is gettin' tight
See for awhile I been beside myself with I, me and me side-by-side
Say to spit it, I spit it, kill it with all of my heart now
The only way I know to keep away from the...

[Chorus]

I'm talkin... tock tick tock tock Boom
I'm talkin feelin' every single one of you in this room
I'm talkin knowing, not feeling I have a right to this mic
Feel it, you feel it the dealer's deal has been sealed, it's alright
Cos now the flow will keep comin for real, it's alright
See, cos I'm not like every other motherfuck with a mic
I'm on my own
Feel like the, feel like the words are comin'
Feel like the style is gettin' tight
See for awhile I been beside myself with I, me and me side-by-side
See to spit it, I spit it, kill it with all of my heart now
The only way I know to keep away from the...

[Chorus]

I'm talkin... BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA
I'm talkin feelin' every single one of you in this room
I'm talkin knowing, not feeling I have a right to this mic
Feel it, you feel it? The dealer's deal has been sealed, it's alright
Cos now the flow will keep comin for real, it's alright
I'm not like every other motherfuck with a mic
I'm on my own
Feel like the, feel like the words are comin'
Feel like the style is gettin' tight
See for awhile I been beside myself with I, me and the side-by-side
Say to kill it, kill it with all of my heart now
The only way I know to keep away from the break down</pre>
