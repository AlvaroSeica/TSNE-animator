[Chorus 2X: Crunch Lo]
Close all your windows and lock all your doors
Beware of the raw, the silent four four
Ground start to shake and walls start to fall
And you can stand tall, it's on, we bring war

[Shawn Wigs]
Yo, my pen's like hammers and I bust out grammers
Rocking fly wardrobe, cuz I pose for cameras
We can make tricks, heavy in the hood like rooftops
New glocks, tuck a few stacks in my tubesocks
B-Box, stay making music with ya mouth Wigs
One of the kids, that be doing they own thing
Big dookey ring, pa, watching the rope swing
Our shit style, kidda, come nice with the quitar
You bluffing, I'm all in, that's just how the shit starts
I gets smart, get brains, money like cocaine
I jump with the holy ghost, that or a jet plane
I maintain, my Theodore continue, got war scars
Ask Trife Diesel, son, he threw me a few bars
He copped me a few bricks, bagged me a few chicks
Had to hook up, for bulletproof glass on my new six

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
