[Kardinal]
Again, again, agian, again, again
Yo! This is Kardinal on the past two
Yeah, uhh you all know how we go
Mastermind tape five 0
T dot O Oh start to the bricks
Kardinal and Rah Digga with the shit
Yeah, yeah! Ha Yeah
You know its gotta be the Circle
and Flipmode Squad, damn breaking all odds
You know how I mean, watch out
Yo, yo its a big solider in this rap shit
I'm cappin' bad ass
I be motion style and take 2 stripes off you adidas
Pass the mic while you got the chance, fast
The master of the class
That you cant surpass
When night come be in the ninetys (You cant last)
I'm fresh-ahh, contact you necksta
Can when I begin to mash out like M.O.P.
Thats what the memo be
Retaliate and find hos in your Gu-o-chi
Listen to me, I'm the phat track filler
Rhyme killer when I combine with Rah Digga (word)
The styles mad flashy, the flow is insane
Instead of tryin' to fuck with me, try to abstain (uhh)
Its a "Trival Pursuit" and I dont play the game
I roll dice with you life, you get trude like sugarcane (nigga)
I'm ten times better than you will every be
You are what you eat and I'm the best emcee, no doubt

[Chorus (Kardinal)]
Now my niggas up north, dirty cats down south
Kardinal and Rah Digga will
(Puts your lights out
