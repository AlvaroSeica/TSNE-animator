[Chorus: Dre B]
It's how it's gotta be, this is how it gotta be
All we do is fight and it ain't gon stop
I used to believe we were all we got
now it's like we should've never been together
'cause I dont know If I believe in forever
It's how it gotta be, this is how it gotta be
it's how it gotta be, this is how it gotta be
it's how it gotta be, this is how it gotta be
I gotta do me I gotta leave
All we do is fight and it ain't gon stop
I used to believe we were all we got
now it's like we should've never been together
'cause I dont know If I believe in forever
It's how it gotta be, this is how it gotta be
it's how it gotta be, this is how it gotta be
it's how it gotta be, this is how it gotta be
I gotta do me I gotta leave

[Verse 1: Chris Styles]
Don't look at me like this was easy to decide about
Last thing I tried to do was give you somethin' to cry about
I'm findin' out this ain't right for me
you ain't supposed to make this a harder life for me
had the ups, the downs, the trust, the smiles
had the love, the sex, everything we missin' now
'cause it just don't feel the same, yea feelings change
it's time to go our seperate ways I hope you feel the same
I know that if I bring it up it's just another fight
and I don't want to go to sleep mad another night
we both 'gon be better off but you won't let go
I'm doing what I gotta and that's all I know

[Chorus: Dre B]
All we do is fight and it ain't gon stop
I used to believe we were all we got
now it's like we should've never been together
'cause I dont know If I believe in forever
It's how it gotta be, this is how it gotta be
it's how it gotta be, this is how it gotta be
it's how it gotta be, this is how it gotta be
I gotta do me I gotta leave

[Verse 2: Chris Styles]
I don't feel the need to apologize
what we used to be turned into a lot of lies
can't say we gave up we gave a lot of tries
it just wasn't meant to be, I ain't gotta lie
I thought we had somethin' but it wasn't
kept goin' back and forth and you couldnt trust me
that's why i wonder why you still hold on to me
all this arguin' feel so wrong to me
days so long to me, nights so short
feelin' like we just met, damn life's so short
I don't wanna break her heart, and I said it from the start
told her if we can't fix this I'd rather be apart
I'm 'bout to make millions, you could've did it with me
but we couldn't change, so I'd rather you forget me
I never saw how complicated this could be
shit, maybe she deserve better, maybe it's me

[Bridge: Dre B]
All we do is fight and it ain't gon stop
I used to believe we were all we got
now it's like we should've never been together
'cause I dont know If I believe in forever

It's money over bitches, so I'ma keep it lit
I'ma do my thang and I ain't gon' trip
Never gon' slip, never gon' lose
won't be long before the next bitch choose
that's really how it is, that's how it gotta be
dealin' with this nigga that was named Dre B
I gotta do me, I really gotta leave
that's really how it is, that's how it gotta be

It's how it gotta be, this is how it gotta be
it's how it gotta be, this is how it gotta be
it's how it gotta be, this is how it gotta be
I gotta do me I gotta leave

[Chorus: Dre B]
All we do is fight and it ain't gon stop
I used to believe we were all we got
now it's like we should've never been together
'cause I dont know If I believe in forever
I gotta do me, I gotta do me
I gotta do me, I gotta do me I gotta leave

I gotta do me (It's how it gotta be, this is how it gotta be)
I gotta do me (it's how it gotta be, this is how it gotta be)
I gotta do me (it's how it gotta be, this is how it gotta be)
I gotta do me I gotta leave

All we do is fight and it ain't gon stop
I used to believe we were all we got
now it's like we should've never been together
'cause I dont know If I believe in forever</pre>
