[Suffa]
I'm wondering where the day went
The clouds have me shrouded in grey but, I'm still out pounding the pavement, word
Drowning the hurt by pounding rounds in brown paper
Founded a label, now I'm drowning in paperwork
But now the crew I'm down with found an escape from work
And I love it, cause that's what your hard work gets you
My heart bursts through my chest, I'm rescued
So forget what the rest do, I'm blessed to
do it with two of who are the best to do it
Do I love it?

[Pressure]
Look at our goals
If never stood in the cold, we wouldn't evolve
Used to put my crooked foot in what I couldn't resolve
But took control now, hard work is good for my soul
And I love it, growing through life and stress
Knowing the fight is just half of self-imposing our righteousness
Contract owners and licences, showbiz in lights, we're just
searching for that moment of pricelessness

[Chorus: Sia]
B-boys, I met you at the bus stop
We had nothing but the tuck shop
We had school ties, the sky and the hilltops
Now we're all grown up and it's still about Hip Hop
I love it, I love it

[Suffa]
Five days deep in the booth, and spent Friday leaping through loops
Then spent the weekend sideways, seeking the truth
And I won't lie, they keep me on my toes these days
But I won't lie, hey I beat 'em with the flow for days
Cause I love it, a pen and pad's like a red rag to a bull
I see red like Leningrad
Raising a crowd from a vacant lot's, like how?
Raising a brow on the face of God right? Now

[Pressure]
And I love it, a life with no regret
No success without a price that owes a debt
I roll the dice and despite the road ahead
Hope that in a crisis I might just "Know the Ledge"
But I love it like takeaway beer
and a sunset to lay away our day-to-day fears
See haters underrate us, but this status takes years
And it ain't where we at, it's how we made our way here

[Chorus: Sia]

[Suffa]
And we can be in a hotel, worst part of town, and
support act, we ain't half as loud, but
twice as nice, you can ask the crowd, then
we passing out in a departure lounge, and
I love it, I hug the road
like an old friend, like the world won't revolve
unless we're rolling on it, it holds them on it
It's soul melodic, and oh, they want it (come on)

[Pressure]
I love it, been chasing the dream
Every day a new place, new faces and scene
Living out a suitcase, few breaks in between
There's been very few days I'd lose faith in my team
Got love far from home through the winter and summer
No matter how hard the road or the distance I cover
Even bitter when I'm missing my significant other
I wouldn't trade it for the world, given another
cause I love it

[Sia]
B-boys

[Chorus: Sia]

[Pressure] + (Suffa)
Come on, Adelaide (I love it)
London (I love it)
Melbourne, Sydney (I love it)
{?} (I love it)
New York (I love it)
Zurich (Uh, check, I love it)</pre>
