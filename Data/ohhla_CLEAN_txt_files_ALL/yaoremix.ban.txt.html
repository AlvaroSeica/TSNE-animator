[Chris Brown]
I'm a king, yes I'm a dime, nigga what you want
And I'm off to Jager bombs, and I'm your daddy cause I pay your mom
And it's hard to hate on niggaz, when you the most hated on
You know what, I don't give a fuck, your girl's pussy's my cologne
And she's on my private jet, she says she wanna try that mile high
Jungle better be shaved cause I ain't fucking wildlife
And she's smoking loud right, can you here me now
But she still be super high when my plane be touching down
Can't tell me stop it cause I'm gon' cop it
Anything you got my goons gone rob it
Nigga it's my time and you can't clock it
And I'm throwing racks, tell that nigga pop it
And she the best dancer going hammer
And this new girl way better
What's my name, you know the answer
Who did the beat? (David-David Banner)

[Chorus: David Banner]
And bitch I'm tall as Yao Ming
And bitch I'm tall as Yao Ming
Look at my daddy, look at my daddy
Look at my daddy, look at my daddy
Yao Ming
Look at my daddy, look at my daddy
Look at my daddy, look at my daddy

[David Banner]
It's all about my business, start collecting interests
Fill my own wish list so everyday it's Christmas
I don't have no time to wait, I need my money with the quickness
Ain't nothing like fast money, can I get a witness
They say that I've been gone, now say what you mean
Bitch, if I fell off I landed on the movie screen
They think I'm off the scene, but it ain't what it seems
They wonder why my self-esteem is called that Yao Ming
My money coming in, that shit coming out
You can gon bump your guns, I put this pistol in your mouth
Mississippi motherfucker, hoe I'm from the south
If you ain't talkin 'bout no money
Then bitch don't open up your mouth

[Chorus: David Banner]
Look at my daddy, look at my daddy
Look at my daddy, look at my daddy
And bitch I'm tall as Yao Ming
Look at my daddy, look at my daddy
Look at my daddy, look at my daddy
And bitch I'm tall as Yao Ming
Look at my daddy, look at my daddy
Look at my daddy, look at my daddy
Yao Ming
Look at my daddy, look at my daddy
Look at my daddy, look at my daddy

[A$AP Rocky]
It's mister pretty mutha-mutha
Bitch, I am the trill man
Spit that gangsta boogie
In my zone, they still dance
Them raiders be like haters
We the trill clan, no the real clan
Think where you got your style from
You niggaz old as my lil' man
Cause I'm ready to go
She next to blow
Like her fat ass, baby flexible
Got a gallery with collectibles
I pay my taxes, eat my vegetables
I'm texas throwed, my necklace gold
Keep a bad bitch, couple naked hoes
A couple of deals with no records sold
That comma-comma decimal
Grippin and spittin that tech
Come for respect
Trippin, I'm flippin your neck
All on my set when I'm pitchin and flippin that wet
Then the dealers feelin a threat
Shawty dancin got a whole lot of ass on her
She don't like to jig it, nigga I'ma pass on her
I said I'm off of the Chorus
She open off of my looks
I got her braiding my hair
I got her rolling my kush
I told her I am a crook
Because her heart's what I took
Holla if you need a job lil' mama
It's off of the books

[Chorus: David Banner]
Look at my daddy, look at my daddy
Look at my daddy, look at my daddy
And bitch I'm tall as Yao Ming
Look at my daddy, look at my daddy
Look at my daddy, look at my daddy
And bitch I'm tall as Yao Ming
Look at my daddy, look at my daddy
Look at my daddy, look at my daddy
Yao Ming
Look at my daddy, look at my daddy
Look at my daddy, look at my daddy</pre>
