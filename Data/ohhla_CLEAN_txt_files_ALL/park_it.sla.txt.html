[Intro: Royce]
You know we 'bout that club life, thug life
Got this bitch bumpin...
Pocket full of money (and we rollin)
Pocket full of money (and we rollin)
P-p-p-pocket full of money
You know we 'bout that club life, thug life
Got this bitch bumpin like a bug bite, club life
Pocket full of money (and we rollin)
Pocket full of money (and we rollin)
P-p-p-pocket full of money (yeah)

[Royce Da 5'9"]
Y'all niggaz fake as fuck
Lipstick on my collar, I couldn't make this up
I live in a real estate like it's housin
Life is grand, like a thousand
Thoughtless countin, my bitch is a walkin fountain
I talk to bosses, you talk to bouncers
Every bad bitch you see in here is comin with us
So I suggest you..

[Joe Budden]
.. you get off of her officer, get rid of them cuffs
So many bitches 'round I don't know what to do with 'em
Head ain't even fun no more unless it's two of 'em
To tell the truth I think beatin it is easy
So when I say I'm poppin models y'all got reasons to believe me
Keepin it +Breezy+, just me and my Weekend CD
Wanna fly in for the weekend and see me
Can tell I beatin it beastly cause look at how weakened her knees be
But the dome's trash, and she fuck me fast
Now she on stand-by, blame the buddy pass (haha)

[Chorus: Royce Da 5'9"]
You know we 'bout that club life, thug life
Got this bitch bumpin like a bug bite, club life
Pocket full of money (and we rollin)
P-p-p-pocket full of money (and we rollin)
P-pocket full of money
Park that motherfucker sideways
Park that motherfucker sideways (and we rollin)
Park that motherfucker sideways
To let these niggaz know you rollin in some motherfuckin SHIT!

[Crooked I]
Like A.I., I cross over when I'm near a +Mike+
I stay fly, even though I got a fear of heights
I aim steady, when I'm gunnin with one of them nines
And you ain't ready, for a hustler who huggin his grind
My chain heavy, so heavy the medallion broke the main levee
Now that muh'fucker is flooded with diamonds
Like a broke nigga, I ain't got nothin to lose
But I'm rich in the club, the couch is under my shoes

[Joell Ortiz]
Yeah, and shorty mouth is under my ooh
I can't say that; radio don't play that
I'm so cool, the sun gotta hate that
But it can never blind me, nah, where my Ray's at?
Yeah boy, this is payback
Y'all was hatin back in May so I said "Hey" and bought a Maybach
The roof gone, so I park it where the shade at
Leave it sideways and spin the +Wheel+, no Sajak

[Chorus]

[Outro: Royce]
Got this bitch bumpin
Pocket full of money
Pocket full of money
P-p-p-pocket full of money
You know we 'bout that club life, thug life
Got this bitch bumpin like a bug bite, club life
Pocket full of money
Pocket full of money
P-p-p-pocket full of money
You know we 'bout that club life</pre>
