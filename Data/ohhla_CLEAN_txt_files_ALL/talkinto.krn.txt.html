Ay K, psst, say K? I know you hear me man
I know you hear me man, K? C'mon man wassup?

[K-Rino]
I was sitting in my living room mapping out a plan
Strategizing on how to get a million in my hand
Man, right then and there something shot spark through me
I thought I heard my TV remote talk to me
He said "What's the deal, man? Why you straining out ya brain?"
You should chill for a minute, "Don't you wanna watch the game?"
I said "Yeah" he said "Cool", pick me up and start flipping
Through the channels then my pants said "Hold up K you tripping"
You know you need to sit down and finish these rhymes
We're pressed for time,  you about to miss your deadline
My rap book cosigned and said "Let's do it"
The stereo said "Nah, let's listen to some music"
The TV was down with the remote coming strong
Moaning and groaning, telling me to turn it on
Got me stressing cuz I know I need to finish up this song
I hear all these different voices yet I'm all alone

(Chorus) 2x
I don't know what's wrong with me
Man, I don't know what to say
Inanimate objects be talking to me everyday
Man, I think I'm gon' crazy cuz it just won't go away
Inanimate objects be talking to me everyday

[K-Rino]
I stood indecisively listening to the sounds
The bed said "Forget about them, just come lay down"
You haven't been sleeping, this is where you need to be
The television said "Yeah, while you lay, you can look at me"
I got a lot of work to do so no I won't listen
Soon as I sat down I heard a voice from the kitchen
I opened the refrigerator, who said what they said?
It was a pretty piece of fish, man I thought you was dead?
He said "Yeah, physically, but mentally you know wassup"
Stop debating with me K get a skillet and heat me up
I said "Man, I got work to do" this is not a joke
Right then I heard my pistol say "Wassup homie you broke?"
If you looking for a way to get some paper out the blue
Pick me up let's hit the streets, man, I know something we can do
As I thought about the money, I was smiling at my strap
My mama picture looked at me and said "Boy don't get slapped"

(Chorus) 2x

[K-Rino]
I said forget this I'm a work on some lyrics
My people need me, my stomach was screaming "Feed me!"
A book was saying "Read me!" the phone started talking
It said "Why don't you call Sharell"
The girl you met in Taco Bell, I said "Well, what the hell"
When I grabbed the phone I noticed the TV was getting jealous
Said "You always on the phone, why don't you tell it what you tell us"
These stuff is calling me, my possession are out to get me
The computer said "Why don't you come spend a few hours with me?"
Then all once chaos and confusion started sparking
At the same time everything in the room started talking
They said "K-Rino you'll eventually have to face us"
My shoes said "We're tired, it's time for you to replace us"
See this is what's it's like man when you tryna grind
And out of distraction visiting and taking over your mind
My homie came to my house sweating and choking
He said "My weed been talking to me, K I need to stop smoking"

(Chorus) 2x
