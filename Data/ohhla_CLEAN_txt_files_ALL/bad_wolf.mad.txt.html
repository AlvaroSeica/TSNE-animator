[Intro]
Show 'em what you got kid {*2X*}
Show, show, show 'em what you got kid
Yeah show 'em what you got kid
Show, show, show 'em what you got kid
Show, show, show 'em what you got

[Mad Child]
LL Mad Child is hard as hell
Battle anybody I don't care if you tell
I excel, they all fail
That's why Mad Child +Rock the Bells+
Getting into fights ain't a problem of mine
Cause I always do my thing when it's clobbering time
All I leave is a gloomy corpse
Cause I'm still on fire like the Human Torch
Forever Swollen Members but burn you solo
Mad Child says FLAME ON no homo
I'm a pyro, watch me spiral
Back into the 90's like De La and Hiero (HIERO!)
I'm from Canada, an awful climate
And I rap like my brainwaves are off alignment (yeah)
I'm in the desert, high on peyote
Eyes popping out like Wile E. Coyote

[Chorus]
Knock knock they don't wanna let me in
Not by the hairs on my chinny chin chin
Dress like a G, tattoos on my skin
Sayin that I'm guilty of all seven sins
Knock knock they don't wanna let me in
Trying to stop Mad from what I could have been
You can huff, you can puff, you can snipe all my friends
But I'm Little Bad Wolf, this is not the end

[Mad Child]
Yo, I tried to get into the States they weren't havin it
(Not havin it) Goin through my bag like a bunch of savages
Customs agent, looking like he's mad at me
Cause I got friends that look like Sons of Anarchy
Knew that I'm a rapper, guess he's not a fan of me
Lookin at me crazy, was pure insanity (this is fucking crazy)
Ten hours go by not panicking
I just sat there still like a mannequin
I was laughing, they kept asking me what gang I'm in
Started being nicer cause I didn't use profanity
I thought, what's the point? Shit, I'll be a gentleman
Instead of being an asshole pumped up on adrenaline
Thinking to myself, I can't believe I'm red flagged
I love the States, how the fuck I'm gonna get back?
It's not like I'm smuggling drugs
All of this just because I hang out with a couple of thugs?

[Chorus]</pre>
