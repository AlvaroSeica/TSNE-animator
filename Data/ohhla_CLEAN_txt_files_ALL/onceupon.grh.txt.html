[The Grouch]
Follow me, follow me
I'm goin.. on a little, excursion
Check it out

Won't you take me away, sweet music
Take me away..
Never lead me astray, I use it
to get through the day..

Like fiends use drugs and, cars use gas
I'm one with the beat but how long will it last
I, once had a vision that, every flower dies
so now I ride the rhythm without pride

I used to have a gray Sanyo, the kind with one speaker
No antenna I used tinfoil to help me pick the weaker powered
stations of my shit was set on cable, bumpin
Pause record to press just in case I caught somethin
I always did, just a kid and that's literal
Daddy used to tell me turn that shit off 
if I didn't he would get a fool
I turned it down to dub it, listened to it later
He knew how much I loved it, but rather I'd be a skater
or a baseball player 

- C'mon dad, let me just hear it
I said no!
- It's only five more minutes, please please
- Slick Rick's about to come on
Go to your room!

So now I'm sixteen, tryin to fuckin mix things
No money in my pockets just desires and some big dreams
My homey got an SP, I really wanna freak it but he won't let me
Let's see, what am I to do?
I waited for school to get out then I scrounged together big bank
Put mine with Jelani's went in halves and now the beats crank
if only for a second though for it was a Mirage
And that's a pun intended in the garage we pretended and meet
I recommend it, strugglin independence
An apprentice not a pro from the get go
Music so genuine, don't even have to speak on it
Got it in my veins but, I'ma let em bleed

Won't you take me away, sweet music
Take me away..
Never lead me astray, I use it
to get through the day..

Like fiends use drugs and, cars use gas
I'm one with the beat but how long can it last
said I, once had a vision that, every flower died
so now I ride the rhythm without pride

What the hell's a Journeyman?  Hipped me to the game
Katie brought em by and life would never be the same
What you say is what they said, pushed my head towards a new realm
seldom ever seen, now we clean, call them crews ? and you out
what I do through a tape and tryin to captivate live
Met up with MPX, Sidol-P, and MOS and felt the vibe
We let it ride one, season to the next
And then we took it, worldwide, came back and couldn't rest
Was so impressed when I met Eligh, 
and the man to make you really see why
you shouldn't speak up in a battle, that'll bring us next to
Mister Nomemono man, do you feel diversity
The Universe MC was next to perfectly X
Acute a freak of nature, and Bizarre's on the fader
We major, our music's major

Won't you take me away, sweet music
Take me away..
and never lead me astray, I use it
to get through the day..

Like fiends use drugs and, cars use gas
I'm one with the beat but how long can it last
said I once had a vision that, every flower died
so now I ride the rhythm without pride

I said I once had a vision that, every flower died
so now I ride the rhythm without pride</pre>
