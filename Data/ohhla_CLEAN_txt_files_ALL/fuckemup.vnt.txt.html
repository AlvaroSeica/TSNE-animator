[Vents]
Ay, word ...
Plagiarists get done, rhyme, dangerous drum
Dropped a lot of bombs but saving this one for now
Powder rap, pounding smack in your eardrum
The most villainous, fear none
Keep the town on lock, stop the madness
Splattering funk on the canvas
Ban this before your child cop this
Causing unrest in the populace
Doctor is in so pop the disc in
Peep while the motherfucking rock persisting
The Lord and master, all should answer
but harbour a fear for the father of disaster
Even your best architect can't protect
when my mechanism react to a threat, what?
Get the picture, it's the Mister
Big, the boss man put your town on the Richter

[Chorus: 2X]
FUCK 'EM UP! If he dealing with a snake
FUCK 'EM UP! If they dogging on their mates
FUCK 'EM UP! If he talk to police
Wait, say what's up, then break 'em up

[Sesta]
If your man skip my shit, tell him he a hater
Fella need to make a meaner face before you see me phased
and in fact I'm brazen, fuck I like Jager
Once I meet the pavement, I'ma need that for the icebreaker (how you doing?)
It's like I made arrangements with the maker to reign greater
So hate it or not, face it I got ya -
face dropped, dreams shattered and popped
Your hype man pat your back like "You gave it a shot"
Yeah, CW's trouble to punk fucks who wanted to act tough
like my city even wanted you
Running mouths, I keep fucking mouths
Still I'm hunted down for being the best cunt around
Drunk now off the Johnny, the blue and the black
and that two hundred proof, so I wanna fuck now
Lady better take a bath before and after 'Oars
depart with force that cause harm for her

[Chorus: 2X]

[Vents]
Next up to wreck, Vents One, the sect, the cult
The salt in your wound, the bruise in the assault
The bolt that keep fam together
and the letter V symbolise man that slam whatever
Got a plan to get a chick with rhetoric
Have her and her friend in a Jenna flick
and I pick correct technique
Wreck the bed sheet then pop her next week
Poppa Red Meat the butcher, puta
Piece of shit rapper punked and then put the -
FUCK down, drown in piss
Sharing your fits not sicker than this
The list of the top - Vents, 'Oars, Hoods then stop
The rest of them can get cock
You know the game, David Blaine with your crop
I never drop names to a cop

[Chorus: 2X]
