(Cypress Hill)
From the Wasteland
Cold steel under my wasteband
Hazardous times
Enenmy Lines drawn in the middle of the streets
The concrete's stained with blood
I still got to eat

(Fear Factory)
When I hit street I made the man understand
I fought with flesh and bled like a man
I rode that edge of darkness mt friend
Stood up to the enemy so life could begin

(Fear Factory &amp; Cypress Hill)
You know you got to
Back the fuck up
Back up off of me

(Cypress Hill)
Traces of igorance
Offense of hatred
The face change in the same old places
Dark nights and lost souls
Collide to cross those
The line between a death and dream

(Fear Factory)
I never wanted to lead your leash
To pull your ton of grief
I'll come back with a fist of lead
To educate your mind with a blow to your head

(Fear Factory &amp; Cpress Hill)
You know you got to
Back the fuck up
Back up off of me

Fear Factory)
Don't let the time pass waiton' for the answer
You are exposed to all of the danger

(Fear Factory &amp; Cypress Hill)
You know you got to
Back the fuck up
Back up off of me</pre>
