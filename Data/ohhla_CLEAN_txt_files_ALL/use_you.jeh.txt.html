[Jehovah's Boy - Intro]
Yeah, WHOO! (hahaha)
Rizin Sons (yep)
God I thank You for another one (Yes, sir!)
You know You a beast, right?
Look, God can use you in any way shape or form
if you just let Him come in, man
That's right! But you cain't be in self; you gotta know this too, listen...
Look...

It's not about you, it's about what
the Father, the Spirit, and the Son do
Trinity - the only triangle office I run thru
Game on the line and I know who to go to
and game is life, give it to Christ!
We need to think twice about decisions that we come to
When you club and party or let the Lord use you (c'mon!)
And youth, we need to get our lifestyles up
Don't worry about go picking them Lifestyles up, feel me?
Think about it as a turnpaper
You gotta have communication, structure, foundation
You want God to speak? Then His voice is the period
Don't run on with yo sentence 'cause then you won't hear Him [You ain't gon' hear Him!]
Listen, God'll be your exclamation point, make your statement stronger
'cause you don't want the devil's comma (nope!)
No more drama, He'll give you the words to say
When they ask you for your sources, you tell 'em "Yahweh" and..

[Chorus 2X]
Just roll wit Him, worship Him and stroll wit Him
Whether you in jeans, Forces, or Dirty Denim
Give up the life of sinnin and live the life of winnin
in everything you do, Let The Lord Use You

Now it doesn't mater the time, temperature, or the place
As long as you believe and step out on faith
With God, no discrimination - doesn't matter you black, white
Dominican Republican or Haitian
God'll use you in any way, no matter your destination
Even when this altercations are hatin (WOO!)
He's the reason we have a source of communication
Gave His son to die wit no hesitation!
And Jesus came, turned water to wine
Just one TOUCH from His hand, everything is fine (I thank You, Lord)
Use David in the fight people thought wouldn't last
So with God on your side, there's nothing you can't surpass
HE'S - pure and holy, tried and true
In Chapter 14:26 of Matthew [What'd it say?]
TWO fish, FIVE loaves, fed a multitude
If He can do it for them, then He can do it for you

[Chorus 2X]
Just roll wit Him, worship Him and stroll wit Him
Whether you in jeans, Forces, or Dirty Denim
Give up the life of sinnin and live the life of winnin
in everything you do, Let The Lord Use You

Truth be told, workin for God is not simple
But think about the pain and the bloodshed that He went through [Thank You, God]
to save each of us in this world we call sinful
So we need to be strong and hold up GOD'S temple
Like Tim Duncan - keep it strictly fundamental
Stay in your Word and encourage the people with your mentals (yep!)
'Cause souls can be saved just by hearin what you been through!
God givin you life is not meant to be accidental
Things that go on in the world, very incidental (yeah)
Temptation hits, harder than punches right to the temple
Your soul gives way just like cavities do to dental
That's why we need Christ just like lead needs a pencil
We are peculiar people that can be difficult
Decisions that need to be made never simple
We were spiritually elected, like the presidential (c'mon!)
So while you're here on earth, think of where you tryna make it to

[Chorus 2X]
Just roll wit Him, worship Him and stroll wit Him
Whether you in jeans, Forces, or Dirty Denim
Give up the life of sinnin and live the life of winnin
in everything you do, Let The Lord Use You

Holla! (WOO!)
Yeah, hahahaha!
Here we go! We got a nice one here, haha!
Rizin Sons, let's GO! (C'mon!)
Just let Him use you man (C'mon!)
Just let the Lord use you, yep!</pre>
