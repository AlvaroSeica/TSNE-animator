Yuh no see mi big house wid car an land? Ah him buy it gimmie
So tell me, weh would I want wid unno skettle bald people mon?
Nuttin... {*echoes*}

[Chorus: Kevin Gates]
These women ain't shit but hoes with tricks; baby girl, you different
When you're not around, it feels like something's missing
And I know you keep it real, never tell no lie
Know you heard what they say true love is hard to find
I just might trust you with my drugs, trust you with my money
Just might trust you with my drugs, might trust you with my money
Girl, I'll trust you with my drugs, might trust you with my money
Might just trust you with my drugs, might trust you with my money, girl

[Pusha T]
Started out as just a fuck mission, who'd have thought I would've fucked with ya
Dope boy, they got trust issues, never imagined being stuck with you
Years later, we in the villa suites, top back, we on vanilla seats
Reminiscing about my episodes with them extra hoes, but you didn't cheat
Cold nights when you couldn't sleep, Celine bags with the giving treat
C Class helped you see past all them other hoes, and that they niggas weak
WOO! I'm good money, got you talking in dollar signs
It's all good that she the top bitch but she just wanna know the bottom line
I don't blame her, I don't change her, I just sit back and give her options
Phillip Lim, Derek Lam, every baller gotta know she's sponsored
WOO! You earned that, now where the fuck did you learn that?
We turnt up, we turnt out we too far gone to ever turn back - AH!

[Chorus]

[Pusha T]
Locked phones, past tense, pass codes, we past this
Pass time, Presidential Rolexes, both sexes
Blue bezel we both flexing, big diamonds, we Bowflexin'
Pitch dope, touch down, both sports, I'm Bo Jackson
Your bitch fronting, that's you (that's you), my bitch stunting, that's me (that's me)
I break it down, then break her off, I'm breaking bread, and that's key (that's key)
We everything that they talk about, know them haters be watching
Them bitches lurking -- your page locked and they still know when you shopping
They still know that I'm ballin', you still know that I'm all in
Your ex nigga, your next nigga gon' hate the fact that I'm spoiling
WOO! But you earned that, now where the fuck did you learn that?
We turnt up, we turnt out, we too far gone to ever turn back - OWW!

[Chorus]

[Kevin Gates]
Please, don't, mind, I just need, some, time
These requirements just gotta make sure you meet, all, mine
Standing there staring with your bow-legged stance, trust being nothing you could hold in your hand
Hustle in the hood, strong with the bands, look at you as something more than a ho I could smash
Or being something bad I could bone at the bag, pole in my pants standing at attention
When you step out of the shower and your ass is wiggling, glance at the ceiling now your glass is empty
Thinking backwards, really I done grabbed a vixen that supposed to be a fitter after video
Stacks'll really blow, dancers get exposed, missing you when you not around
We text each other when out of town, you remain the same no matter up or down
These other women stay pretending, money come and they help us spend it
But'll fuck my niggas in the very minute, I was down and out and had to go to prison
Kinda high role play, acki; and again I say I like these hoes
