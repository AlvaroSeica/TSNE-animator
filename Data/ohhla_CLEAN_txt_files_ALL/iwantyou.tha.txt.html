No one else can ever
No one else can ever
No one else can ever

Yeah, uh
Yeah, uh

[Thalia]
What did I
Do to deserve such a man so special in my life
So many days and nights
I get on the go while I sit and wait for mister right
Baby, then came you

[Thalia]
Laidback with your sexy smile
When you move your body you just drive me wild
If you're feeling me, baby, tell me now
Because I want you, I want you

[Thalia]
Baby, no one else
Can ever want you like I do

[Fat Joe]
I'm feelin' love in the deepest fall, give you the keys and all
You even when helped me when the beef was on

[Thalia]
Tell me what you feel
'Cause I'm feeling something real

[Fat Joe]
I feel the same way, you make the Don say
Girl, I want you, girl, I need you

[Thalia]
Can't you see
How this love affair would be good for you and me
'Cause baby, I swear no other man can do
The things that you do when you love me
Oh, baby, you're my lifetime fantasy

[Thalia]
So smooth, love the way you walk
I just love to hear when you talk your talk
So if you're feeling me, baby, let me know
Because I want you, I want you

[Thalia]
Baby, no one else
Can ever want you like I do

[Fat Joe]
I'm feelin' love in the deepest fall, give you the keys and all
You even when helped me when the beef was on

[Thalia]
Tell me what you feel
'Cause I'm feeling something real

[Fat Joe]
I feel the same way, you make the Don say
Girl, I want you, girl, I need you, babe

[Fat Joe]
Slow down, love
Don't you see me with my girl, what you thinkin' it was
I know you're used to seein' me in the clubs
Different chicks, sippin' Cris', just a million in dubs
But I've changed, only got eyes for her
Believe me, ain't no girl dividin' us
We could maybe elope, have a baby and all
'Cause I don't wanna be a player no more

[Thalia]
Baby, no one else
Can ever want you like I do

[Fat Joe]
I feel the same way, you make the Don say
Girl, I want you, girl, I need you

[Thalia]
Tell me what you feel
'Cause I'm feeling something real

[Fat Joe]
I feel the same way, you make the Don say
Girl, I want you, girl, I need you

[Thalia]
Baby, no one else
Can ever want you like I do

[Fat Joe]
I feel the same way, you make the Don say
Girl, I want you, girl, I need you

[Thalia]
Tell me what you feel
'Cause I'm feeling something real

[Fat Joe]
I feel the same way, you make the Don say
Girl, I want you, girl, I need you

[Thalia]
Baby...baby...baby...baby...
Baby...baby...baby...baby...</pre>
