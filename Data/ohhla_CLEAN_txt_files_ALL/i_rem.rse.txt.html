[Verse One]
"I remember"
Since Big Daddy Kane used to Operate Smooth
And spit that insane flow that I'd relate to
"I remember"
Stop the relapse, hearin' O.G. Rap and Ra
Playin' Chronic got me screamed at as a child
"I remember"
To all my niggas and my bitches, fuckin' hands in the air
That made my pops draw the limit with that crap in his ear
"I remember"
Junior high
+Check The Rhime+ of A Tribe Called Quest
Used to vibe, little guy, maybe 5'4" best
"I remember"
Walkin' like uh...huh, uh...huh
Scotched taped my popped tape and bumped it some more
"I remember"
I fiend for +Microphone Fiend+ and didn't even flow
+Eric B. For President+ when I was too young to vote
I remember

[Chorus: scratching]
"Cause I'm so smooth" - Big Daddy Kane
"I remember"
"I'm the microphone fiend" - Rakim
"I remember"
"It's a demo" - Kool G Rap &amp; DJ Polo
"I remember"

[Verse Two]
Mad young blastin' +Life's A Bitch+ word she's a hoe
It's true
At 14 I didn't know her at all
Went to college
Two miles from the gate to the steps
No bus only room for +Cuban Linx+ in the deck
"I remember"
Summer time high
Walkin', thought I would die
Spinnin' at the station
Blendin' Method's +How High+
"I remember"
And now I'm a DJ man, the solution
And I just learned to scratch, used to practice from +Shook Ones+
"I remember"
But I didn't swing chant
How they tell it was I?
I blend everything with +Happy+ by Mary J. Blige
"I remember"
And then, look up in the sky
It's a bird, it's a plane
Yep, since Biggie died the whole game +Done Changed+
"I remember"
Soft walkin' money, fuck bitches, word up
"Fuck the world don't ask me for shit" from +The What+
"I remember"
Positive stuff
Great advice
The game did I enter
Like it's Bigger Than this Hip Hop
And I remember

[Chorus]
"I remember"
"Life's a bitch and then you die
That's why we get high
Cause you never know
When you're gonna go" - AZ
"I remember"
"Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
Scared of death, scared to look" - Mobb Deep
"I remember"
"Get lifted in the staircases, word up, incarcerated Scarfaces" - Raekwon
"I remember"
"Fuck the world don't ask me for shit
Everything you get you gotta work hard for it" - Method Man
"I remember"

[Verse Three]
And when I heard, "Hit you with no delayin' so what you sayin' yo"
I turned off my favorite show and I turned up my radio
"I remember"
Rise and L sides on the tape
You could play Benjamins in the club five hours straight
"I remember"
And they'd say it was great
Bad Boy I had a whole crate
Then take a break to Special Ed after bumpin' that Faith
"I remember"
The ways we used to do that Kid &amp; Play
And mute it so the crowd could say the Ohhla Ohhla Aye
"I remember"
+Bonita Applebaum+ and then we'd bring it back to date
And play +Killin' Me Softly+ and the hands would head for space
Like they had memory playin' for the whole entire day
On every single station, rock or rap or R&amp;B
"I remember"
Badder +Ain't No Nigga+ and then I'm party then I'm ghost
Two o'clock back to the spot 
Watch them niggas that are close
"I remember"
Bumpin' with my niggas as we laughin', vibin' out
To how a man would dance and scream Put In they Mouth

[Chorus]
"Put in her mouth, mouth, I mean her motherfuckin' mouth" - Akinyele
"I remember"
"Bonita Applebaum, you gotta put me on
 Bonita Applebaum, I said you gotta put me on" - A Tribe Called Quest
"I remember"
"So what you sayin' yo? Silly with my nine millie so what the dillie yo? - Busta Rhymes
"I remember"
"I get paid, my records is played, to put it short, I Got It Made" - Special Ed
"I remember"
"Eric B is on the cut and my name is Rakim" - Eric B. &amp; Rakim
"I remember"
"It's like this and like and like this and ahh
 it's like that and like this and like that and ahh" - Snoop Dogg
"I remember"</pre>
