[movie sample]
And as Head of Scotland Yard
I must warn you that there are only two courses
which can be taken
Either I formally charge you with murder
and send you to the galloms
or to have you committed to an institution for the criminally insane

[Chorus 2X: Skarekrow]
Feel the energy beyond the galaxy
Skarekrow beats

[Skarekrow]
Black misery, tame grain misery
Miserable suffering and agony
Gonna make it my way 'til the motherfuckin' cemetery
Early in the day I seen an old man pick up a casket
and hurl hearsts by itself, I found myself
I found myself hidin' behind tombstones
I'm tombstoned lookin' for Warcloud Smugglin' Booze in the Graveyard
I pick lots of skeleton bones

[Warcloud]
My raps is Rikers Island, Gino, Sing-Sing and Attica
Alcatraz, dark Christmas club, great gats about to blast
Rinsed in blood, garths and statesmen hold your weight some mo'
Cider house, great war memoirs, avenue of the strongest
Gnomes red, white and blue dragons are in my back yard
Red bats with green wooden eels that's so shiny
Mechanic planet static is clammy down in Miami
The feud is covered with blood but its only the light of sunset
Molecules, bat like biter blue and polished jewels
Dummy, I come from a planet of Algerian mummies
ThrowinÂ’ crummy dollars at you, slit open tummies
Your whole crew is chummy, I'm tending my vampire bunnies
Bloody, open and exquisite heavy swords
Pick finger, click for demolition

[Chorus 2X]

[Nu3tron]
Nu3trons bind his physics, catch an aneurism
Slip with equal MCs and swear "come prepared!"
With black dairy smile meanwhile slip projectile
Apricots for duck, my Kingdom is low we fuck
Been twisted in the whole night, drunken myself inside of it, rip
through the body armour
Drop a dirty blade microphone, I'll save lake man made muddy swamp thing
Ultra jaw breakering chomping, young tiger pronting and taunting
Add up the bluie dark matter, escape with my black ladder

[Vulgar]
Lyricism elevates mental state as it fakes brave and torment
My conscience be a fucked up remake to mystory like the Stone Henge
Don't play me for layin' MC's in glass fence
So you get the clear picture, motherfucker
Of who's dead, type of vocab that pumps lead
Finish scitso face since my name was said
Causing me to be the MC who's sick in the head
Drum kicks like Bruce Lee
Physically parting bones from body like Moses Potty
The red seat, hardcore click monopoly
Monopolising the whole galaxy, elevate on Skarekrow's beats
Elevate on Skarekrow's beats</pre>
