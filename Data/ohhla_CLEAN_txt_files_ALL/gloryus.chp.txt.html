Typed by: AZ Lyrics

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, yeah
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la,
Hey, howdy, I am super duper good
You can find me drowning in some mini mixed with groupie love
All of the above like I'm Maino or I'm [?]
When it's no more room, it's [?] to Cleveland if I needed you
[?] whip more, fucking niggas stomach up I'm throwing them
Hot sauce, really used to be killing when I'm drinking though
Used to ride my bike all day, too [?] single jungle though

Don't stop, grind hard, watch cops, give them the smile
Not doing wrong, just chilling oh yeah
We gotta find our ways,

If I focus on my dizzle, not these popped out hoes
Trying to find me a Hale Berry up in bed
For somebody I can desperately housewife
But really, fuck you nigga, I ain't trying to play housewife [?]
Independent that give us a good [?]
Understand what other and other records
But women I'm amazing, but I know it's crazy
See see, now you don't have to like me
Please respect the fucking glory of the mighty

We the all, all, all, all mighty, glory, glory, glory, all mighty
Glory, glory, glory, all mighty, glory, glory, glory, all mighty
Glory, glory, glorious

You want something call me Chip I just be chilling though
[?] through these crazy hoods and bumpy roads
Memories are living conditions worst than you ever seen
Now it's total opposite, I'm self made, fresh and clean
Straight up menace, we some rebels bad it did it right
Most advice I get, I just can't use it, they don't live this life
Hope for the best but it's probably bad as it seems
I brainstorm coming up yeah I had a few dreams
Used to stand outside at [?] getting tips to help with bags
9 years old running shopping carts to get that quarter back
Shooting my bang bang, [?] don't drive too fast, around my hood
Wish that I could change they perspective and tell them what's really good
Blow about 4 hundred a day on that purple Callie [?]
Cause life is over [?] maintain the financial sanity
Say what's on my mental when disregard the emotional
Try to stay on track and keep it to where I'm supposed to go
Before my grandma passed, she told me I will lead the people
I'm all that is man fearless, have yet to meet my equal
I'm call, ladies and gentlemen, hood niggas and bitches
You all about to witness, how nobody fucking with us

We the all, all, all, all mighty, glory, glory, glory, all mighty
Glory, glory, glory, all mighty, glory, glory, glory, all mighty
Glory, glory, glorious</pre>
