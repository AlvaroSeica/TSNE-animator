(Bootleg) Part 2, 19 muthafuckin 96, Bootleg tha
muthafuckin' rap Kapone, Ghetto E, &amp; my nigga Shoestring, gonna
Stick N Move &amp; bust up yo ass fo' tha 9 6

My memories get haunted by events in tha past 
Had an outlet to be free from dirty visions at last  
A brothaz out here stalking me but bitch you aint no
I've been poppin' window panes, my brain aint tha same no mo'
Living just like a criminal, but my mind still carries me
I'm seeing the bloody images of tha tools that bury me
Skeletons they walk with me, while holding my right hand
My mother be weepin' N cryin' while watchin' me box with a deadman
Load tha AK, spot a family &amp; kill 'em all.  
Take a butcher knife, &amp; spill some blood at tha fuckin' morgue
It's Murder
You bitches better understand
Motherfuck a plan, I'm gunning tha bitches down right where they stand  
Homey should've ran, but then again I wouldn't advice you to  
Cuz a 44 is good to go when I'm busting caps at fools
Sendin' you hoes to school  
Well fuck the books N desks
No description or police sketch,  you bitch &amp; no arrest
You can try yo muthafuckin' best to stop a villian on a killing spree  
Living is so fuckin' hard &amp; dying is so easy to be
Murder to tha first degree-demi, gotta represent 
Kill for dead presidents, in flint is sweet like peppermint
You'll never find my fingerprints, so watch me getaway
Murder victom found,  killer though, free to strike another day
Up-up and away, to get some Yahjl back where I stay
tha fedz are like mosquitos empty needles alley ways
I'm goin' to tha thang, take tha pain, I'm a ghetto champ
There's no court of law, my whole neighborhood's a prison camp,
Food stamps &amp; drug dealz is all a nigga know  
Strut &amp; Kokane got me addicted nigga pass tha blow
Coming in ya spot with my glock to make my getaway smooth
Nigga close your eyez, no surprise, bitch boom! 
Another Stick N Move...

CHORUS Mov'n N Mov'n out, take that cocaine out your house,
sight that any.  Here no evil see no evil, bitch N I done got away.
Mov'n N Mov'n out, take that cocaine out your house, sight that any.
Here no evil, see no evil, bit

(Shoestring) A giggerdy Gangsta from tha streets, so Muthafucka dont make me bust ya
Buck ya down, quick to bury your ass &amp; then I'll bust some 
Like the fuckin' terror that's on the quick to put ya town away
A Silencers on the tip so muthafucka there be no sound today  
I'm taking you niggaz to war, so playa haters lock ya door  
An AK 47 leaved his brains up on tha floor
A killa Riddlin' fuckin' around and frontin' about his stashes
3 killaz with masses, all we leave is ashes.  
Take ya shit &amp; dashes, now of in a cascets 
the fever fo' a murder got me breakin' out in rashes
So hide your watch-n-rings, cuz shoot and fill ya ass up with holes
Reachin' fo' ya clothes, ain't no marbles on ya toes
Stretchin' niggas out like limo's and creepin' down my block
Shoestring got a glock, can you follow us wanted by hollow point shots?
Hmmm, betta watch yo ass, a killaz creepin' up from tha past 
My finger's fast, &amp; you just saw ya fuckin' last 
Shoestring's a killa, so dont fuck with this Grim Reaper 
Mo' cloud than a beeper, and I hit you with this street sweeper
Down where I'm dwelling, niggaz sellin' and I go swellin'
Put snitches in ditches, cuz them bitches, they always tellin'
My click is thick, so we be screamin' "Fuck the law"
Creep mental state as three killaz you aint never saw  
Not from the shore so whut tha fuck the sources thinkin?  
Must stop the Drinkin?  and Dankin'?  I'm-a-leave you stinkin'
Better fuck your mutha, than fuckin' that nigga, that Shoestring
Cut off ya hands &amp; all i want bitches? The rocks and rings 
My polo's bloody, my case was lookin' kinda muddy  
Step with this bald head, fuck you dread, leave him dead
Rolling trough tha stocks, I'm so high, fillin' that bitch in
Looking through that tension, still kickin' Flint shit
S to tha H to tha O-E-S-T-R-I-N-G 96 pullin' tricks ridin' the duece with them dicks
Out tha Ass.  So 'xcuse me as I dust my grooves
I'm diggin ya chick My pocket's thick, nigga it's time to Stick N Move...

CHORUS

(Ghetto E) Ughhh, rattat to tha tattat, I'm-a-take take him out his misery
Put his ass in a box &amp; leave him as a memory
(See when you sleep, that's when we creep
Uh, Get on your toes, knock you off your feet)
Game I peep.  I did not know him, but I met him and now I got him
Mask to Mask took my shit off, and then I shot him  
Left him bloody with no money.  Cut his pocket
Grab my glock cocked it, seen his head, popped it, dropped it  
Now I was rollin' like a muthafuckin' bowling ball.  
(You sendin' up who? You sendin' him where?)
I'm sending him to tha graveyard 
No time to play, Eric Dorsey's on another mission
I called up Jody, he be coldin' police in tha kitchen  
Them niggaz talkin', conversation kept him on tha phone
Killa gone grabbed my chrome, I'm in his home.
Let's get him gone, put him in a headlock till I heard him choke.
So I used my kane, whip &amp; slit his throat
Creeped up on Jody, Jody's dead, now this shit is smooth
Got away with the money and the gang, Eric Dorseys on a stick-n-move!
