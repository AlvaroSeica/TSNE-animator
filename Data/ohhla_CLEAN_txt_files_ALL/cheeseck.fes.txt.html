Go go go go go, go go go go go
You a douja boy, I done told you, boy
Go get me some muthafucking cheese cake
You a douja boy, I done told you, boy
Go get me some fresh Cambodian milk
Go go go go go, go go go go go
Go go go go go, go go go go go
You a douja boy, I done told you, boy
Go get me some fresh Cambodian milk
You a douja boy, I done told you, boy
Go get me some muthafucking cheese cake
Go go go go go, go go go go go
Go go go go go, go go go go go
You a douja boy, I done told you, boy
Go get me some muthafucking cheese cake
You a douja boy, I done told you, boy
Go get me some fresh Cambodian milk

See Ness and Phillie, try to send them for cheese cake
Like damn, dog, Diddy sent 'em for cheese cake
Niggas called me up from 106 &amp; Park
Freestyle Friday, nah, I'd rather throw 'em to the sharks
Fuck Making of the Band, my life making of the man
From a young G, to O.G., understand
Fight Club the rapper, after the party over
I knife a rapper, fuck who the nicest rapper
This nigga phoney, smack Sub Zerol, please
T-K?

[T-Bird]
Ya'll ain't gonna do me like that, freeze
I dont' know who told ya'll rappers you was more better
I guess these days you gotta be wack to get cheddar
I can say anything like whiptidy, dooda day
Back to the day your stupid ass'll get blown away
I don't respect ya'll, so I had to check ya'll
I eat ya'll up real quick, I Hannibal Lect' ya'll
Now please don't talk about guns, cuz ya'll wouldn't shoot 'em
Half of ya'll niggas is cake, ya'll like sounding cute</pre>
