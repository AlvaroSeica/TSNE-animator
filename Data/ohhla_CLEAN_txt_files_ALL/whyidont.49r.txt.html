Hook

Why's she skeezin' this season, I don't know
Why this girl committing treason, I don't' know
Why she lying I'm believing, I don't know
Why she saying that she leaving, I don't know

Harun Karim

I'm an organ donor, I'll slide up in if you let me
Let me into your heart and I'm sure you won't forget me
Cause we got one love deuce deuce for troubled times
Forties suffice, I can get nice and pay the crime
Black Don Juan running game like Jackie Joyner
You the first to act ill and the first to point the pointer man
You feel it's real yeah you feel it's real
From the bottom of my heart to the top of the steel
From the appetizer to the main course meal
I think of you on two occasions and you know the deal
When I first saw you, I said what I gotta do to get her
Threw a couple of brews in my system and start to sweat her
Better get together because my game's so nice
I ain't sweating the lyrics because my rhymes precise
Contemplated then initiated the flow
She ate it, then reciprocated I know
First question, do you have a man
She said no I don't, I said you gotta understand
I don't be running around with somebody else's shortie
Just a few things I picked up from Papa Gordy
She said no problemo, I hear you loud and clear
Then I proceed to whisper in her ear

Hook

Why's she skeezin' this season, I don't know
Why this girl committing treason, I don't' know
Why she lying I'm believing, I don't know
Why she saying that she leaving, I don't know

Harun Karim

As I proceed to give you what you need you shank
While I'm treating you right, you taking me to the bank
On a crazy withdrawal when I'm all about deposits
The grapevine swears you got bones up in the closet
And on top of that, you really got a man
You said no I don't, I said you gotta understand that
Baby baby you sadly mistaken
Because I ain't the one for your moves to be fakin'
So don't even speak because I ain't trying to listen
Concentrate on a cure I'm sure you'll find something missing
Like g's lead to keys, keys lead to hoes,
Hoes lead to lies, anything goes
Jas Mace knows the oodles and the o's
And the eyes of the original mass is the physical
Change your spiritual this is a lyrical
For one, girl I hope you get the job done

Hook

What's the reason for the skeezin', I don't know
Why's my queen committing treason, I don't' know
Why's she do the things she does, I don't know
Why'd she say she was in love, I don't know

Jas Mace

Let me start it like this it began with a kiss
Under the steps a mutual agreement was next
After six months everything was cool
We went to different schools so she tried to play me as another fool
She didn't follow the rules she kept another
And kept me in the dark I was only food for the sharks
The spark that lit my fire wasn't her desire
It's a shame, I gave her water and she threw it on my flame
She ran her game and stuck her cleats on my soul
I guess she called my bluff cause now I'm forced fold and give it up
I'll keep it straight like noon
All alone in my room because time heals wounds
And after seven moons I got a call on the phone
Talking about she feels blue and how she wants to start a new
I won't forget the past but everyone deserves a second chance
I think I'll ask my crew, what am I supposed to do</pre>
