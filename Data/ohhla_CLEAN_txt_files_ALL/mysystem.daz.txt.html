Kurupt (Daz):
Gangsta (Yeah), Gangsta (Yeah)

Daz (Kurupt):
I Know y'all like The cars dat go boom (...boom ...boom..)

[Kurupt]
Beitch, it's the Gangstaz!
What Up Daz? where dem hoez at?
where dem bitchez at? where da homiez at?

[Verse I - Daz]
Cruzin' down the block 
and my system bangin' out about a million watts
all these suckers wanna stare and jock
and hear my shit subbin' down the block
I'ma tell you what I got and my shit be thumpin'
5 10s in the back we bumpin' 
chrome deez on an ice machine and god damn my shit be thumpin'
boom boom thats just my amps
e-q'z with the alpine deck
y'all niggaz cant really fuck wit this
all my homeboys know who got the shit
see the girls like bass when it's in they face
and when they love it cut it feels so great
when I pull up homegirl I got the gate
all my homeboys luv that bass

[Kurupt]
All I want is my gold deez 
talkin on my phones and a Armani's
OG DP GC's kurupt and D-A-Z
64 dippin' down the streets
switches or not as long as-it got beats
all my homeboyz on the cut like we dont give a fuck
what the fuck? what bounce my homeboys rounded
DPG surrounded you know how gangstaz roll
G'ing in full control hittin' up in mo' control
dipping on all gold 
why the fuck you wanna play wit a gangta man
my system bang.

Chorus - Daz (Kurupt)
My system bumpin' down the street
My system bumpin' down the street
My system bumpin' down the street wit nuthin but bass
Can you feel it y'all... huh-ha
can you fell it y'all
I said
My system bumpin' down the street
My system bumpin' down the street
My system bumpin' down the street wit nuthin but bass
Can you feel it y'all (Boom Boom Boom Boom) huh-ha
can you fell it y'all (Boom Boom Boom Boom)

[Verse II - Daz]
Lexus, Benz's, Lincoln, jeeps
wit the beat with the color TV'z
wit the fresh ass deez wit the killer weed
and my shit lookin' hell'a clean
you can hear me around the corner music bangin'
because I like it loud
wanna buy dippin' high wit the homeboyz 
Me and my niggaz be shakin' the crowd
50 amps and 30 woofers and my shit be pushing power
cruzing not givin' a fuck rollin' about 3 miles an hour
im the shit at the car shows 
i'll be flossin wit all the hoes
old school cadillac cutless then 64's

[???]
See me and my girls will buy a lexus jeep
rollin 6 deep till you hear the beat
bumpin' loud move twice lets move the crowd
gettin' rowdy rowdy wit my bumpin sounds
no doubt get a price and my system tight
y'all niggaz ain't the only one wit Karl Kani
got bumpin' beats stepped of on your chest
showing all y'all niggaz that I bump the best 
See we be wilding pro-filing sipping crystal 
&amp; we styling and went it comes to the subs
my shit be thumpin the loudest
so all you fellas don't doubt it
y'all sisters wit me then shout it

we bringin heat out the trunk
all you fools reckognise im the mad
cuz you can keep on trying and still get can adapt to this

and you know what the fuck I mean
Nigga..

[Kurupt]
Baby tou've ever heard about a gangsta? Then you heard about me
Then you heard about the homiez, baby D-P-G
See I'm smooth an I be movin
and my shit bangs you heard where I hang?
Dogg Pound Gang

oh you aint heard the thang yet
