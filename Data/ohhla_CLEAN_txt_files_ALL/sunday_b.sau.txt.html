[Saul Williams]
I can't believe the news today
I can't close my eyes and make it go away
How long? How long must we sing this song?
How long? How long? 'Cause tonight we can be as one
Tonight... broken bottles under children's feet
Bodies strewn across a dead end street
But I won't heed the battle call
It puts my back up, puts my back up against the wall

[Chorus: Saul Williams]
Sunday bloody Sunday, Sunday bloody Sunday
Sunday bloody Sunday, Sunday bloody Sunday
Sunday bloody Sunday, Sunday bloody Sunday

[Saul Williams]
And the battles just begun
This many lost, but tell me who has won?
The trench is dug within our hearts
Mothers, children, brothers, sisters, torn apart
Sunday bloody Sunday. Sunday bloody Sunday
How long? How long must we sing this song?
How long? How long? 'Cause tonight we can be as one
Tonight...Tonight, tonight, tonight..
Sunday bloody Sunday, Sunday bloody Sunday
Sunday bloody Sunday, Sunday bloody Sunday
Wipe your tears away...Wipe your tears away
Wipe your tears away...Wipe your tears away
And it's true we are immune
When fact is fiction and TV: reality
And today the millions cry
We eat and drink while tomorrow, they die
And the real battles just begun to claim
The victory Jesus won on Sunday bloody Sunday
Sunday bloody Sunday</pre>
