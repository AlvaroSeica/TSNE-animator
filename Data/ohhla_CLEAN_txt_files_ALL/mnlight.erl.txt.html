[Earl Sweatshirt]
Started thinkin about a normal life, it got me suicidal
Standin in the kitchen with a noose and a rifle
Hang or bang, hockin loogies in a bible
Dancing with the devil; tonight's our first recital
His hands on my hips, he take control of my movement
A couple of minutes pass, and I don't know what I'm doin
Just dance to the music so nobody will laugh at me
But the fuckin voices in my head keep askin me
Have you ever danced with the Devil in the pale moonlight?
You ever danced with the Devil in the pale moonlight?
Have you ever danced with the Devil in the pale moonlight?
You ever danced with the Devil in the pale moonlight?

[Hodgy Beats]
I live all over, my roomie's a bum
Fuck a bitch, never sober, virgin bitch nun
Sound like she dyin when that virgin bitch cum
My used penis beats on this virgin bitch drums
She asking me to dance, I asked for my pants
Ended up with an argument - sirens, ambulance
Scratch her off my list, the situation biased
She made me a +Milkshake+ and forced me to try it
Nah I ain't Nas, get the fuck off my dick
Besides from the smell of it I'm hatin the flavor
Last night for the hell of it I raped her neighbor
Bit her fillings all through my vampire teeth saber
("Ahh, Jesus, please!") She screams for her saviour
A nun with a bum, fuck you bitch you better pay up
I need to eat, place to sleep, new shoes, agin feet
Alligator hair heat Gatorade made her sweet

[Earl Sweatshirt]
Bitter sweet seven fist fighting with a reverend
Bless sessions niggaz fresh as Crest breath is
Devil in my chest I inhale more cess then
Place one missed call to heaven
You ever danced with the Devil in the pale moonlight?</pre>
