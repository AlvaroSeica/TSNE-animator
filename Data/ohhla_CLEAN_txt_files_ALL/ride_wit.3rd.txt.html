Boy come on, take a ride with me
And let me show you, the dirty 3
Pack your bags, don't forget your heat
Cause it go down, in the dirty streets

[Mafia Mike]
What you say boy, I don't play boy
Get up out my way, before I get out my K boy
With no delay boy, I'm bout to spray boy
Cause on these streets, your ass will decay boy
We want more chips, than Frito Lay boy
It's rough on this side, fuck where you stay boy
My niggaz is gorillas fa sho, ok boy
We can go to war, with it all day boy
You get it out of line, you better go and pray boy
Give you the casket, and the flowers to lay boy uh

[Hook - 2X]

[D-Reck]
I don't know if you done heard, but this the land of yay and herb
Where you can get served, every day on every curb
So nigga what you want, cause fool I got it
And if I'm out of pocket, I can tell you where to find it
Everything from cocaine, to fine ass dames
Rovers that Range, big Benzes wide frame
Propped up on thangs, pop trunk with the bang
The hustle and the game, and the piece and the chain
Got diamonds against the grain, candy coated paint
Got the wet and the drank, the X and the dank
Got pressure on my brain, from this task-4 stangs
Got hoods and these gangs, with these gats that flame
The joy and the pain, sun and the rain
Fortune and the fame, some of heat be scorching mayn
Hotter than Kayan, and her little sister Anne
Raging cajun cooking, will make a nigga say man

[Hook - 2X]

[Lil' Shay]
I hope you get the picture, cause it's on TV
Take you to a place, that we call the 3
Gucci frames, bad dames in 3D
In a city, hustlers in the VIP
Big clubs, big thugs big drugs
Parked outside, big trucks big dubs
Southside Tex, Lil' Shay gon ride
I-45, till the day I'm Northside
Eastside, Westside got hoes
Love it when they put they lips, where they don't belong
S-Class gator, play hater on the block
Want a house on the water, and a boat by the dock
Lil' Shay baby, don't bar no plexers
Boys round here, powered up on X's
It ain't all about your horses, spurs or your Lexus
We gotta keep it playa, Wreckshop Texas-Texas

[Hook]

Boy come on, take a ride with me
Let me show you, the dirty 3</pre>
