Song:   Get Better
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Imagine a song, that really reached out and touched kids
And not in a Daily Mail way, innocence corrupted
But in a way where criticism remained constructive
And wasn't too politicised and children weren't instructed
To behave in a way that was unrealistic
Or made out the way they live was somehow sick and twisted
But simply pointed out reasons to get it together
Not shouting "get a job", but just saying

[Chorus]
Get better, get better, get better, get better
Get better, get better, get
Get better, get better, get better, get better
Get better
Get better
Get better, get better, get better
Get better, get better, get
Get better, get better, get better
Get better

You see the young mother capital is where I live
Little kids being raised by slightly bigger kids
Society seems unphased that this is how it is
While I'm constantly amazed that this is how it is
They confuse love at first sight with lust at first light
It must have hurt right when trust first took flight
You're young, you've no rights, you long for new heights
But some of those nights leave more than love bites
Tops cropped, skirts stop at the top of their thighs
And the boys got that hungry look in their eyes
They wanna be grown up and have respect you see
But they're acting uneducated sexually
I ain't saying' be celibate
Go out and have your fun
But there's plenty you can do without impregnation
And there ain't nothing wrong at all with having children
Just build yourself a little before you try to build them
And

[Chorus]

I see small town syndrome growing in size
There's not a lot to do, so the kids they decide
To get drunk every night, a glazed eyes disguise
Do drugs every night, tired from their lives
People getting off their faces for a quiet night in
Kids rolling around the streets rowing and fighting
But it's all just because life ain't too exciting
And it's easier than trying to do the right thing
But there are other choices -- if you want them
You don't have to tow the line and just float with the flotsam
You can build your time better when you find a passion
The Internet and public services give free education
So it really ain't a case of rich or poor
It's a case of self-motivation and nothing more
Like Billy says, whether you have or you have not wealth
The system might fail you, but don't fail yourself
Just

[Chorus]</pre>
