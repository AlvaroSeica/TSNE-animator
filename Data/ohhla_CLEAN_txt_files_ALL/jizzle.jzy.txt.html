Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Don't let me rip shit for ya
Still come through ya
Panoramic ass niqqas
Yeah I shoot right through ya
Hole in ya niqqa yeah you gonna need a ruler
The way I measure that you can call me the ruler
Walk up in this motherfucker like a walking cooler
Yeah I'm walking cooler niqqa thanks to my jeweler
Oh Kim Wasabi, big ballin is my hobby
I should buy a W and throw a party in the lobby
Said a homeboy told her I was fucking roxy
Swear I hate niqqas I should be a fucking Nazi
Don't know what you hear baby that could be a rumor
Stones in my ear yeah that could be a tumor

Shawty redd on the track it's a hit
Yeah we got jizzle in the booth talkin shit
Give it to ya hard cause we know you like that
Shawty tell em what it is they don't know me like that
Go young on em go young on em (I'm goin young)
Go young on em go young on em (I'm goin young)
Go young on em go young on em (I'm goin young)
Go young on em go young on em (I'm goin young)

Young jizzle what's wrong what are you sayin
Say sumtin wrong what's that what are you payin
It's 2010 and you payin Patrick Ewing
Last time I payed that number I was wearin Patrick Ewing
At the end of every song you be talkin bout work
I said as far as I'm concerned motherfucker you a jerk
Real niggas love it when I talk that shit
Can't wear skinny jeans cause my Glock won't fit
How you make it out the streets

They need a real nigga homie give me dat mic

Shawty redd on the track it's a hit
Yeah we got jizzle in the booth talkin shit
Give it to ya hard cause we know you like that
Shawty tell em what it is they don't know me like that
Go young on em go young on em (I'm goin young)
Go young on em go young on em (I'm goin young)
Go young on em go young on em (I'm goin young)
Go young on em go young on em (I'm goin young)

Mine as well do this motherfucker strapped up ain't I
Pull this motherfucker out and blast a bitch can't I

Shawty redd on the track it's a hit
