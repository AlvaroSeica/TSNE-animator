[June Marx]
Pages of Warrior scripts, hatred and cartridges
Equals pain, and decaying carcassess
Slain sergeants, laying in the fortresses
Remorseless, train where the archers is
Blood spill when we reign thru the heartlesness
Understand why, my actions anti
Infiltration, factions in shanghai
Keep the cannons on standby, supreme
Marx manuever scheme thru the darkened ruins
With a sharpshooter regime, spark rugers obscene
Harsh intruders my team, move in the myst= its magic
Wicked gadgets, ar's with clip attachment
Envision havoc, its systematic
Out the system stricken victims wishing to kick a habit
I lit the matches, devils burn and liars fall
The twin perils have returned, time for war

[Lone Ninja]
I arrive with the rifle grenade, no rival surviving the raid
Spies will betray, they dying while frightened, afraid  
The sniper dismays, I'll strike in the night or the day
Slice with the blade, I invite you to heighten the rage	
Time to engage, I'm sly I'll surprise your brigade
Disciples are slayed, I'm swiping your life for the praise	
The cycle's the same, we fight and the titles reclaimed
Vile terrain, applying the trials with pain		
Powers were drained, I savored the medicine
I prayed for the second wind, the chambers are menacing		
My sabre is threatening, it severs and maims
Make way for the veterans, it's perilous reign			
Tremulous lames, defeated they're probably nervous
Step in the flames, feel heat of fiery furnace,	
We siege with the weapons and cause commotion
Decieving the heavens to cross the ocean</pre>
