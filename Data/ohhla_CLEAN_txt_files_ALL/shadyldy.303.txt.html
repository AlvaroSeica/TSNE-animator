[Hook - 2x]
No, no baby baby
No more, acting shady
Know that, you're my lady
You driving me crazy

[Willis Case]
Girl my patience is slipping
Because, I just don't understand why you be tripping
It was, the beginning of a beautiful story
But now, you just straight up ignore me
You go out, with your friends on the weekend
But oops, you forgot you got a boyfriend
That cares about you
And would love, to spend some time with you
Come on girl, tell me what's wrong
You're suppose to tell your man, what's going on
I've tried to tell you what I'm feeling, why you acting shady
Why you gotta be decieving, baby

[Hook - 2x]

[James D 303]
Why you acting shady, baby I don't understand
I might be crazy, for you I do all I can
But I'm your man, so why you tripping the way you do
Is it something I said or something I did, only if I knew
Stop acting shady, cause you're my lady
Until the day, when we say we don't need eachother
But the lies, no more
Cause the relationship, we had together
Won't ever be the same, once me or you say bad goodbye
Never turn your back on me, I will never turn my back on you
So stay true, cause you know that I love you
Too much in love, and loving you with all my heart
Just remember girl I, loved you from the start
Baby girl, let me ask you lil something
Why you acting shady, with me
Your the girl, in my world forfill your fantasies, real dreams
Diamonds rings credit bills, and things come and let me know
Talking so so shady is a no-no, so there be no more cries
No more lies shady is why, and there will be no more second tries
I wanna be the only one to take it as a story, this lyrical flow
So I let this one be known, to the one and only
To the one that's only, baby why you acting shady

[Hook - 3x]

[James D 303]
S-H-A-D-Y, lady
Stop acting shady baby, you driving me crazy
Never gonna fade me, that you wanna play me baby
But it, hurts me insiiiiiiiiiide
I feel like I wanna cry, don't need to try
I can see no love, up in your eyes

[Hook - 2x]

[James D 303]
Why you acting shady, baby I don't understand
I might be crazy, for you I do all I can
But I'm your man, so why you tripping the way you do
Is it something I said or something I did, only if I knew...</pre>
