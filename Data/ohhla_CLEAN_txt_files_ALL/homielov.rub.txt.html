[Chorus: Rubbabandz]
Ay shorty, you really look lonely
Can I be your homey? I don't wanna be ya man
I just wanna be your friend, someone you can talk to
Someone you can trust and depend
When ya man ain't acting right, give me a call
I come scoop you, we can go have a ball
I never had no country girl before
Cuz I'm a big city nigga, straight from up north

[Rubbabandz]
Excuse me girl, what's ya name, can I holla at you?
It look like you in some pain, what he putting you through?
I know you need someone to talk to, but you got built up inside
Looking like it's way overdue
You gotta let it out sometime, you feel much better
So please get it off your chest, cuz I'm a good listener
And I won't say a word, that shit is for the birds
Just don't make me mad, cuz I'm a spiteful ass nigga
Besides that, I'm here to chit-chat
Chit-chat, ease ya pain and ease ya out the slacks
Once you puff this purple haze, it's a wrap
I know you wanna use me for get back
You know I feel a little cheap, but I won't lose no sleep
If you was mines, niggas would of been trying to beat
That's the name of the game, and I play by rules
And I ain't worried about your dude, cuz I keep the tools
So, he better not come over here talking that shit
Like ain't you that nigga fucking my bitch
Cuz I can tell him what it is, like that's what it is
I'm not the type of guy to lie on my dick

[Chorus]</pre>
