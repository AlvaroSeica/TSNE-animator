[Chorus: Repeat 2X]
Invigorating, high pulsating
What we got banging is such a great thing
The prince of this earth must bow to the king
Know your place amongst these human beings

[Verse One]
It doesnt take a rocket scientist
To make your own hypothesis
On who's rockin this
Thank God for you mad child
You made me a happy man
Let's go ahead and deposit these grants
Stay based and confused and I'm holding on to clarity
Blow my funds hit the show for charity
Dont play I fight compassion asking for forgiveness
Cuz it's only God I sin against
L to the M to the N to the O
If it was'nt how could I say it was so
Grew up in the L.B. where kids brought theyre brothers heat
Those were the back whoppers and bunch seed
On tour must be at my class reunion
Like oh I been workin and what you been doing?
Step to it, through the thick and thin
I knew it would happen just did'nt know when
Invigorating

(Chorus)
       Repeat 2X
      Invigorating, high pulsating
      What we got banging is such a great thing
      The prince of this earth must bow to the king
      Know your place amongst these human beings

[Verse Two]
A stove away, there's just no way
He could barely defeat the purpose so erase the gray
Blue sky's all day
Doesn't effect my mood the sun still shines
Theres more to this then what the ear hears
Like what it took to get me here
If I'm an open book, number one novel
Can't say I grovel, Lord keep me humble
Pick me nose branch I'll listen to your heart
I prefer mine pumping like non-tart
Do what you will, I'll love you still
There's a piece of me in Mandeville
Beauty ay no way take off hoser
It feels good to deal with a fore-closure
We'll know when it's over (echoes)

(Chorus)
       Repeat 2X
      Invigorating, high pulsating
      What we got banging is such a great thing
      The prince of this earth must bow to the king
      Know your place amongst these human beings

[LMNO repeating]
Know your place amongst these human beings
Invigorating, high pulsating
Invigorating, invigorating, invigorating</pre>
