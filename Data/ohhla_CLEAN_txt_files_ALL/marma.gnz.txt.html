*Verse One*
[Peter Gunz]
Can I fuckin' play?
I got a quarter mill' in the bank
No one to thank but me
Break me -- "Gunz"
Bronx ball playa
Take the gatas and suits, from niggas rich
See me -- I'm stackin mah chips, flippin' mah chips
Bitch, I...
Peter Gunz, I...
Listen I, gobble, pour all I broke
No joke, clear the smoke, or get smoked
Nigga what?
You stand ya plan
You faka's join, but what's the point you makin'?
Nothin' taken
I seen nigga's come and go
But I'ma say a
A mothafuckin' Bronx playa
I went from eatin' outta trash
To walkin' and pushin' the E-Class
From chickens, to fuckin' bitches that's lookin' like Stacy Cash
An'-now flash
Moms prayed to God that she'd be green
But it was hard for me to raise somebody, I never seen
Cherish
I testify when they ask me ta speak
I said that only Lord knows two rants to praise the Lord
(Nah)

*Chorus*
I think it's bout time we'd shine (shine)
Nigga's made chips off mine (mine)
Climb the same rhyme, recline
It's time to bring pain to these nigga's (haaahh)
Drain these nigga's, if they wanna (who wanna?)
I gotta crew from Soundview wantin' war (c'mon)
Start a revolution with mah niggas from the fall (from the faaall)
We gotta bring it all Uptown in the party (uhhh)
Cause Lord Tariq won't you come and get shit started?
*Chorus*

*Verse Two*
[Lord Tariq]
Check it yo, I'm in the big black Bronco
Sippin' Rimmey out the bottle
From the Bronx like Billy Blanco
Fortin' high-on on the throttle
My shit dates back like American Bandstands
So ya'll niggas sit and relax while these grands change hands
Stand tall, stick yo chest out boy
And be a man
You bust one, you let them all-out, and go all-out
Wit' dat bug you had to fall-out wit, head-chest
Don't let-'em fall-out, shit
And if I fall-out, quick
It's Money Boss
I'm at the midnight blue
Three times to excite you
Have you drippin' off mah chest, wantin' ta be crew
Wantin' to be flauntin' the shit that we do
But ya can't nigga, ya still young, it's still alot of shit to go through
I been through enough drugs to get you high, think "I'm Bout It"
Think I'm lyin'? 'Cause I'm rhymin? Nigga mah path would be routed
Shit is real, don't you battle, now get ya bricks fa' tin
Now that's the Steel House of "Bout It" (House of "Bout It")
Money Boss...

*Chorus*
I think it's 'bout time you'd shine (shine)
Nigga's made chips off mine (mine)
Climb the same rhyme, recline
It's time to bring pain to these nigga's 
Drain these nigga's, if they wanna (yo who wanna?)
I gotta crew from Soundview wantin' war
Start a revolution with mah niggas from the fall 
Gotta bring it all Uptown and hit the party (party)
Peter Gunz won't you come and get this shit started?
*Chorus*

*Verse Three*
[Peter Gunz]
'Ey-yo
When you gettin' chips, you got mad tricks ridin' ya pony
But when ya slip, the same stank bitch is wanna journey
Ya baby motha', probably fuckin' brotha' if he trickin'
You resort to ass-kickin', she dick-lickin'
Now you in the mountains up north
Gimme the Nine, time ta think about the dumb shit ya did, play a mind
Sekikes, to all the chickens you treated, like they was queens
Ain't never rolled a nigga recenin' up in his greens
Conversatin his low, ho'
Ain't you gettin' chips? 
You get a check on the first birth, help a nigga live
I used to get.. rent money, I sent and spent money
I never lent money, I burned and bent money
So why you actin' funny, wit' yours?
Put them drawers on yo ass, and I knew the stash, a baby of course
When ya baby bounce up into the slack 
I took your son like he was my son, he never lack
And baby wise up

*Chorus*
Nigga it's 'bout time you'd shine (shine)
But nigga's made chips off mine (mine)
Climb the same rhyme, recline
It's time to bring pain to these nigga's 
Drain these nigga's, if they wanna (yo who wanna?)
I gotta crew from Soundview wantin' war
Start a revolution with mah niggas from the fall (haahah)
We gotta bring it all Uptown and hit the party (party)
Lord Tariq won't you come and get this shit started?
*Chorus*

*Verse Three*
[Lord Tariq]
'Ey-yo
I be the Bronx narrator, recitin' my ghetto stories
To mah playas, from the smallest to the tallest category
While you got shadow warriors, money ain't mah problem
You want aches and breaks, of that shit? Well I got 'em
Money Boss, get crossed off, so ring the alarm
Bronx roots, I recruit the thoughts, I'm making bombs
I'm the calm and the stong, Hiroshima the bomb
I have you in protection programs, somewhere on the farm
Wit' mah eyes on you niggas, like the feds and faka's
Got they eye's on the sippa's, big tippa's, and dice shaka's
Small head-build, means you the small-time nigga
With small thoughts, and small means, of gettin' small figures
By all means, expedite, "Live long -- prosper"
Ya live-wrong suits, got'cha
Remember that mink you bought? For 9 G's and somehow split the scene
It's in the government auction, for 900 -- what does it mean?

*Chorus*
I think it's 'bout time we'd shine (shine)
But nigga's made chips off mine (mine)
And climb the same rhyme, recline
It's time to bring pain to these nigga's 
Gotta, drain these nigga's, if they wanna ('ey-yo who wanna?)
I gotta crew from Soundview wantin' war
Start a revolution with mah niggas from the fall 
We gotta bring it all Uptown and hit the party (uh)
Peter Gunz &amp; Lord Tariq ta get this shit started? (get it started)
*Chorus*
