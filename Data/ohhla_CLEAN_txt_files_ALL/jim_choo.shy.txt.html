Alright, turn the beat up
I see you
Ok

I see you Ma
In ya $1000 weave, masterpiece
diamond face on ya sleeve, Pell Ma Nay?!
Waist petite, Alright!
Jimmy Choo shoes on ya feet, you right
Slide in the side the spida
I know you tired of guys that try to lie to slide aside ya
Forget about that, lets go
Forget about rap, I'm Po!
I mean really I been gettin money since niggaz is rappin funny
I'm fast as shit
Cause you look like you got ya head right
I just hope you can give head right
Racin through eggshell headlights
New York is mine
Relax ya mind

[Hook: Ashanti]
Ha Ha Haaa Haa
Can't nobody
Do them things we do
Cant nobody
Touch me like you do
Cant nobody
Love me like you do
Cant nobody
Be like me and you

This is me
Who else you expected
Ring down to the necklace
Some hoes say I'm sexist
Cause all I wanna do is stuff coke in they breasts
Sit back with stacks, count money
In the zone, up on the throne
Like bitch c'mon
I need a Prada chick to take this dick and take this brick and bake this shit
Basic shit
We can go shoppin and buy sum things
up in harry Winston ma
try sum rings
I have you feelin like you was Princess Di
So much cuts on your wrist
Think you try suicide
No lie
you ain't heard
extensive trips
Expensive whips
you ain't see nothing like this
not in ya life
if I ain't that nigga
shit you lookin lucky

[Hook]

Who gon cop them hoes?
Po
Who gon rock them gloves?
Po!
Who gon pop them fo's
Po
Well I'm glad you know
You don't need to ask who hotter
You notta, me lava
Shyne whammy gotta!
See you niggaz in hell
And thaz ?
Feds wanna tell
Just post bail
Million cash
Now you know that ain't rappin pimpin
Please believe that
its how you smoke like me
its chess when I clap 'em up
that ain't enough, back 'em up
Niggaz talking real greasy on them rap records
Like I wont strip ya naked and take ya necklace
Give it to my soldiers like, 'Hold this'</pre>
