[Chorus]
For a lifetime of service in the name of love
I wanna, thank you (Ooo-ooo-OOH)
I could say it a thousand times and it wouldn't be enough
I wanna thank you, for everyTHING you do!
I wrote this song about'cha, what would we do without'cha?
Uh-huh, and we won't forget (Ooo-ooo-OOH)
And all our lives have been blessed cause you're simply the best
And we, thank youuuuuu

[Cee-Lo Green]
I admire, your quest for fire
The one that always burns inside
After all you've been through, you still continue
In memory of the ones that fought and died
So we're thankin YOUUUUUUUU, pure energy come true
Alright, well
Oooohhhh, have I got news for you
Yeah, you are appreciated, uhhh!

[Chorus]

[Cee-Lo Green]
Now please know, that you're my hero
Each and every day is new
And when I see ya, I wanna be up
If only I was as brave as you, now
So I'm thankin YOUUUUU, for everything you do
Uh-huh, yessss
Oooohhhh, I know this much is true
Dude, my momma was a firefighter

[Chorus]

[Cee-Lo Green]
Now ever since I was a little kid
this was a dream that I had (so bad, so bad, so bad)
And every now and again
I wanna ride that fire engine so bad (so bad, so bad, so bad)
Yes I do~!
