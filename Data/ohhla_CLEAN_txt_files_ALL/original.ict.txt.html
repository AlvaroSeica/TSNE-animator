..Original Gangster!!

[Verse One: Ice-T]
Ten years ago, I used to listen to rappers flow
Talking about the way they rock the mic at the disco
I liked how that shit was going down
Dreamed about ripping the mic with my own sound
So I tried to write rhymes something like them
My boys said: That ain't you Ice? - that shit sounds like them
So I sat back, thought up a new track
Didn't fantasize, kicked the pure facts
Motherfuckers got scared, cause they was unprepared
Who would tell it how it really was? - who dared?
A motherfucker from the West Coast - L.A. 
South Central fool, where the Crips and the Bloods play
When I wrote about parties it didn't fit
Six in the Morning - that was the real shit

[Chorus: Ice-T X10]
O.G. - Original Gangster

[Verse Two: Ice-T]
When I wrote about parties, someone always died
When I tried to write happy, yo I knew I lied
Cause.. I lived a life of crime, Why play you blind?
A simple look and anyone with two cents would know I'm 
A hardcore player from the streets
Rapping about hardcore topics over hardcore drum beats
A little different than the average though
Jet you through the fast lane, drop you on death row
Cause anybody whose been there knows that 
Life ain't so lovely on the blood-soaked fast track
That invincible shit don't work
Throw you in a joint, you'll be coming out feet first
So I blast the mic with my style
Sometimes I'm ill, and other times buck wild
But the science is always there
I'd be a true sucker, if I act like I didn't care
I rap for brothers just like myself
Dazed by the game, in a quest for the extreme wealth
But I kick it to you hard and real
One wrong move (*Gun Shot*) and you cap is peeled
I ain't no super hero, I ain't no Marvel Comic
But when it comes to game I'm atomic 
At dropping in straight Point Blank and untwisted
No imagination needed, cause I lived it
This ain't no fucking joke, this shit is real to me
I'm Ice-T - O.G.

[Chorus: Ice-T X8]

[Verse Three: Ice-T]
Two weeks ago I was out at the disco
Two brothers stepped up to me and said: Hey yo
Ice, we don't think you're down, what set you're claiming?"
E drew the Glock, yo, my set is aiming!
Dumb motherfucker tried to roll on me, please!
I'm protected by a thousand emcees
And hoodlums and hustlers and bangers with Jheri Curls
We won't even count the girls
Cause they got my back and I got theirs too
Fight for the streets when I'm on Oprah or Donahue
They try to sweat a nigga, but they just didn't figure
That my whip is as quick as a hair trigger
"He is not your everyday-type Prankster"
I'm Ice-T, the Original Gangster

[Chorus: Ice-T X10]

[Verse Four: Ice-T]
So step to me if you think that you're ready to
Got any your bullet proof? - well mine's going right through
This ain't no game to me, it's hollow fame to me
Without respect from the streets, so I don't claim to be
The hardest motherfucker on earth
Catch me slipping, I can even get worse
But I don't slip that often 
There's a coffin, waiting for the brother who comes up soft when
The real fucking shit goes down
Take a look around, all them pussies can't be found
They talk a mean fight but fight like whores
I'm from South Central fool, where everything goes
Snatch you out your car so fast, you'll get whiplash
Numbers on your roof top, for when the cops dispatch
Gang bangers don't carry no switch blades
Every kid has got a Tech Nine or a Hand Grenade
Thirty seven killed Last week in a crack war
Hostages tied up and shot in a liquor store
Nobody gives a fuck 
"The children have to go to school" Well moms, good luck
Cause the shit is fucked up bad
I use my pad and pen, and my lyrics break out mad
I try to write about fun and the good times
But the pen yanks away and explodes and destroys the rhyme
Maybe it's just cause of where I'm from
L.A. (*GUN SHOT*) that was a shotgun!

[Chorus: Ice-T until fade]</pre>
