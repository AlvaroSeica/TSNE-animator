-Intro-
A lotta weed in the system
A lotta liquor in the system
I got pills in my system

[Kyzah]
Been a month, a week, couple days without smokin
Smoke blunt, got weak, broke the weed down split the swish open
Yeah east oakland boys tend to spark alot
Transform a drop buttons transform the top
Just bought the box 8-80 a killa shox
I'm Bay Bridge on my way to that Mission Rock
Right ova wata', me no right up in the corna'
That hype right in a moana
Shoot it right up ova' wata'
No bring your patna, tell her go network
I need that ballgame, Head Game Expert
Yea cause I love that turf work
Von Dutch skirt with a dozen Chanel purse
Online net search you find that turf dirt
Remember I said it first
Its Kyzah Lets Purp

[Hook]
I'm in a Scraper sittin on the whips
550 Barneveld Nigga I'm on one
45th and Heavier Nigga I'm on one
We on one my nigga we on one
------------&gt; 2x
EAST OAKLAND North OAKLAND West OAKLAND
Richmond Vallejo Frisco
My niggaz is on one

[Clyde Carson]
Lil' weed Lil' ecstasy Lil' Remy with some lil' bitches next to me
Lil' head thorough leg be the recipe
but she said she too good to have sex with me
I ain't trippin pimpin as long she ain't testin me
she just tryna go and tell her patnas that she mess with me
She a team fan groupies they stay touchin me
thinkin I'm Hova she Mya she tryna get the best me
I blow a couple for the fuck of it
she bustin I ain't fuckin it
she lovin just to touch a pimp
yeah now I'm cuttin it
lovin it cuz I bust on it
total disrespect no regards for her husband
shit I'm 4 hunned miles away
sunset knockin somethin bounce back to the bay
trap dump from the jump I'm all out of my scape
Go Guriella gotta get it Spectator parade

[Hook]
I'm in a Scraper sittin on the whips
550 Barneveld Nigga I'm on one

We on one my nigga we on one
------------&gt; 2x
East OAkland North OAkland West Oakland

[Mayne Mannish]
Yeah I'm a self-driven nigga no need for brakes
you see the candy paint lac no need to chase
with a g up in your face probably bustin your face
Any race they can get it man its far from the fake
Been known from rockin mics respected in o-4
My team they know whats up them others they close dough
I'll take ya to a place you never tried to go
Berkeley waterfront where niggaz is gettin dough
You never seen a young playa like Maine
Cahenas on way hes far from being lame
No games the bay shall be changed
From niggaz who stepped up whos known as The Team
You start from the bottom reach the top
most Niggaz they start from the bottom yet they drop
Reach forward ma clean ya act up
The 4 fifth conceal for niggaz who act up

[Hook]
I'm in a Scraper sittin on the whips
