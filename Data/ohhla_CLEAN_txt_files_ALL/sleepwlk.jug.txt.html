Song:   Sleepwalker's on Ya Radio
Typed by: Luchesse@web.de

Do me this one favor: turn ya radios up
And don't touch that dial like ya radio's stuck
Jugz hot enough to burn ya car radials up
These guys are terrible, I thought fellatio sucked
Didn't think about the art while you makin' yo' bucks
The Bully take ya heart right before I take yo' truck
Any emcee better than Jugz? Ain't no such
In other words non existent, I'm consistent
Strong arm the innocent, if you not bomb resistant
Be prepared to lose the battle, plus arms and ligaments
I'm armed and militant, so watch yo' family
Cause they might end up where Aquaman be
Glocks is handy, chicks drop ya panties
Tell Uncle Jugz all about your hot fantasies
Kids on ya block can't stand me
While kids who check "Bei mir ist alles aus" demand me
Nothin' fancy, just skills and mics
And a cute face that give ya girl chills at night
Shoot, I scoop ya moms if her grill is right
Leave with the dough for ya'll house phone bill tonight
I'ma show y'all what Hamburger Hill is like
Sleepwalker freaks the beats, Jugz eats the freaks
Keep the heat, plus keep the trees in heaps
Read and weep, run fast, or bleed in the street

[Hook]
Slleeeeepwalker's on ya radiooooo
Jugga The Bully got that crazy floooooooow
Keep your distance don't get near me yooooooooooo
Bei mir ist alles aus here we goooooooooo

My rhymes are like me: fat not thin
Bouncers ask how the guy with the strap got in
I knew somebody, that's how y'all cats got in
Had to be cause you cats not men
Guess these cats got friends cause they raps is slim
While Jugz drop the bomb like an action film
Back again, attackin' till they need aspirin
Stop sweatin' Sleep so y'all can do tracks wit' him
Girls do they nasty dance on his lap for him
Even healthy Fr√§uleins got claps for him
That's why Jugz come runnin' with these raps for him
And if need be? Jugz pack the gats for him
Luchesse puttin' UnderWorld on the map again
We Fed Ex U.S. Dollars in stacks for him
Cut rappers short like slacks with no hem
As an afterthought don't raps against him
Cause all them sound real wack against him
I'm wild like my dog in the back fenced in
Chicks pay me to sin, they want my babies for them
But they didn't get a kid, I gave rabies to them
News reports say the chicks go crazy for him
Not decompression, but I make ladies bend
Hold up, the trees got me hazy again
From North Cack, but rep Deutsch like Mercedes-Benz

Bei mir ist alles aus here we goooooooooo</pre>
