1 - 	Take me there, I wanna go there
	Take me there, lets go there
	Take me to that great place
	With wonders and wishes 

	Take me there, I wanna go there
	Take me there, you know where
	Just take me to that great place
	With wonders and wishes

[Mya]
Sittin here thinking about yesterday
About what we did and how we used to play
Just the thought of you brings a smile upon my face
Thats how it makes me feel to see you everyday, whoa

Where we go, nobody knows
And what we do is between me and you
So come on and take my hand, to that special place
Where smiles come to life and dreams come true, ooh

Repeat 1

[Blackstreet]
Lets make a wish
Close your eyes and count to five
Cause you know that everything will be alright
I see the magic in your eyes
Strong enough you know to bring your dreams to life, whoa yeah

Where we go, nobody knows
And what we do is between me and you
So come on and take my hand, to that special place
Dont want this dream to ever go away, ooh

Repeat 1

[Mase]
Now Angelica the one with all the exposure
Dil is the one they drop in the stroller
Tommy got the whole world on his shoulders
Cuz Dil cried to sleep cuz his eyes are beat
And as soon as they bring Chucky to petro
Chucky gets scared, Chucky says lets go
If I was a Rugrat, it wouldn't a been so real
Me and my twin woulda finished like Phil and Lil

[Blinky Blink]
Now with one wish, Blink grant you one trip
Where we going this adventure, who you wanna come with
See and you're my little brother that I'll come get
Run with, but it gotta be done quick
Though Chucky is scared and Tommy is sad
And Phil and Lil misses their mommy and dad
So pick a time and date and find a place
And I guarantee you that we all get home safe

Repeat 1</pre>
