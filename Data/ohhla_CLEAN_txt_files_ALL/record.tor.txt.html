Aiyo
My nigga Torae got bars, you feel me?
He 'bout to go in
None of that punk smoove shit
We catchin bodies right now
Is you ready, motherfucker?
Yeah

[ VERSE 1: Torae ]
The pen game official
Made to make change while makin change and let's not make that a issue
I make niggas miss you
You can send shots with hashtags, I'ma send my shits back with the pistol
I'm back on my grizzly, really was never off that
BK all day, you from where it's soft at
I bring summer heat, tell 'em niggas fall back
'fore I give 'em winter ball verses and they ALL CAPS
You got fans, I got fam and they all clap
Yours is applause, mines for goals on your score cap
These niggas all wack - all fact, no opinion
Runnin around in tight clothes cause they flowin isn't
Your co-ops and co-signs got you co-dependent
You niggas on the buildin, fuck it, I'm goin in it
These Beats and Rhymes is Life like the homes from Linden
If you ain't get it you ain't got it, ain't no comprehendin
They need to stop pretendin
I hate to follow a nigga, you choose to follow a nigga just cause the topic trendin
That was a Twitter analogy but you got the meanin
Or meanin, however you pronounce it won't stop the pinnin
I turn Men II Boyz, opposite of Michael Bivins
When I spit it, the biggest niggas'll feel like a midget
I'm downgradin y'all, AR to your A&amp;R
Lay off or I'm sprayin y'all, ain't often I'm playin, dog
Now take heed to the words that I'm sayin, y'all
I leave maggots on you faggots with the K and all
My debut will Slay you, ( ? ) Kay and all
Not the Drama King but drama ring when you play it off
Fuck is you playin for?

[ CHORUS: Torae ]
It's like I been tellin you, dog
This shit crazy, these new kids ain't ready at all
They sound basic, that bullshit ain't ready for Tor
It's all Matrix, is you niggas ready?
They ain't ready
It's like I been tellin you, dog
This shit crazy, these new kids ain't ready at all
They sound basic, that bullshit ain't ready for Tor
It's all Matrix, is you niggas ready for war?

[ VERSE 2: Torae ]
No signature sound, I start spittin
Niggas can tell it's Torae from the perdition
That set me apart, no partition
But still I give you niggas work like a audition
I heard when I talk, they all listen
They hang on every word from the god, they all Christians
I baptize 'em with lines, this y'all christenin
You blessed with the gift of my presence, this y'all Christmas
With no wishlist, it's clear that I'm naughty and nice
My Jesus pieces got the gaudiest ice
Couple kids and a wife, live a glorious life
But still be one to give your shorties the pipe
Tell her call me tonight, but I don't pick up
There's such a contradiction in my diction
Figured you learned the lesson if you listened
But niggas so conditioned to be calm in they conditions
And to bein so complacent when they face it that they miss it
I'm here to show you niggas the deal, no myth hits
No upper respiratory condition but spit sick
While y'all's accusin Kanye like eatin fishsticks
I hit the Stu, cooked up GOOD Music for my discus
I'm not the nigga you wanna diss or dismiss
You catch your name on a toilet paper, my shitlist
Niggas be sayin they fly but never lift it
And I been rockin 'Lo since Ralph Lauren was a Lifshitz
Now all the popular kids was all the misfits
You blink durin a fad, you mighta missed it
This illogical, logic lost to magistics
No Xbox 360, but the game twisted
I'm here to Straighten It Out like Corey Penn did [/penned it]
And that's a double entendre in case you missed it
You find your only option - you optimistic
And not can afford a operation after your shit split
Niggas is senseless

[ CHORUS: Torae ]

[ Rah Digga ]
Security!
Please escort these gone motherfuckin factor-ass rappers out of the building
Please
We're done with you
Be gone
Release the hounds on these ( ? )-ass motherfuckers
Get 'em outta here
