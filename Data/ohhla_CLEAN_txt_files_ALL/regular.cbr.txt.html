Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse: Tyga]
picture life in the movie frame
smiles in your face but every body fake
tryna claim a role, acting on the stage
the world wanna show and we all the play
just to say, why didn't you want me yesterday
I blacked out, got some change, now they feeling me
couple chains, gold chains on, mr tee
they see me low key so nigga don't bother me
I wanna relax with some time, all just for me
cause lately I been meeting girls, chasing me
wanted the spotlight, damn, she spotted me
dang you bad baby, let me tell you one thing

[Chris Brown &amp; Tyga]
you got it (I like how you flaunt it)
and I need it (I really, really want it)
can I get (oh)
your love?
girl I'm on it (I'm really, really on it)
til morning (I be up in the morning)
what I gotta do to meet you (I just want this)

[Chorus]
I want a regular girl
want a regular girl [x2]

I want a regular girl
want a regular girl [x2]

I want a regular girl
want a regular girl [x2]

I want a regular girl, when I get home yeaa

[Verse: Chris Brown]
the fame don't mean nothing, neither does the money
I just want my friend right here with me
the light will fade away, no matter how hard I grind
today ain't the day, so I'm just gonna live my life
all day long, same shit different video
all them silly games, I don't wanna play no more

[Chris Brown &amp; Tyga]
you got it (I like how you flaunt it)
and I need it (I really, really want it)
can I get (oh)
your love?
girl I'm on it (I'm really, really on it)
til morning (I be up in the morning)
what I gotta do to meet you (I just want this)

[Chorus]
I want a regular girl
want a regular girl [x2]

I want a regular girl
want a regular girl [x2]

I want a regular girl
want a regular girl [x2]

I want a regular girl, when I get home yeaa</pre>
