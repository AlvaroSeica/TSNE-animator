Yah, Embee, Promoe, Prime-time
check it

*Don't hate the media, become the media
They already know we are
so why no't get louder and louder and louder.*

Prisoner code T.H.X, 1-1-3-8
I'm a break the chains and litigate Bill Gates.
And Ricki Lake type intruders of your private life
It's like they got a million private eyes in the public eye
That they publicize doubleized, In a love disguise,
Wolf in a sheep clothing, I just love these guys,
Talking about freedom of speech, freedom of the word,
It's a well-known fact you need cash to make your self heard with,
Topics like this, they don't let litterarly to stop me,
But I'll be happy to sell 20 000 copies,
That don't make no revolution, so what I'm I to do then,
Rather die luging then get my message diluted,
Dilemma: either you say nothing to a lot of people
Or you try to kick some sense to a minority of equals
Who already know what you know and don't need to be schooled
But 85 % of the population keeps getting fooled

(Chorus:)
But the massmedia misleading ya,
all 'em press idiots gets greedier
chasing headlines and deadlines
the truth left behind us
it's primetime and the blind lead the blind
It's the massmedia misleading ya,
all them press eateries gets greedier,
chasing headlines and deadlines
the truth left behind us: primetime

Yah, They tried to drug me with TV
Dissever mislead me
But on the low though, I don't keep what they feed me
Believe me, I throw it up like a bulimic
Don't tell no one though they put me in a clinic
For brainwashing, they want to stop my guys
With money and lies, they got the troop monopolized
Manipulate and pollute the Mind State
Generations of mine rate
My voice echoed off the walls of Jericho and Berlin in the old days
Listen closer here and now
In your own hallways
It's your baby brother quoting me
He got all tapes, some youths of today
Want substances, not all saints
Massmedia don't wanna deal with the real issues
They want you to think, life is about chasing the riches
But that materialistic shit will fade away
Don't get caught up in the modern day slavery tray

(Chorus:)
It's only massmedia misleading ya,
all the press eateries gets greedier,
chasing headlines and deadlines
the truth left behind it's primetime
and the blind lead the blind
It's the massmedia misleading ya,
all them press eateries gets greedier,
chasing headlines and deadlines
the truth left behind it's primetime
and the blind lead the blind

Notice that that's the opposite of the standard view about democracy
It's a game for the elites, ehh, it's not for the ignorant masses

The unemployed no longer wants to be used
Modern day slavery, computers rules
In the school system, of miseducation
The entertainment business of ???
Capitalist interests, run the press 'n information
Hightway to hell approaching, the end-station
At a faster pace than formula 1 racing
Blaming the problems of society, on immigration
When in Sweden may guns export it to poor nations
Causing wars and starvations
Killing africans and asians
Calling it "foreign relations"
And it's all an annihilations
Yo, you forced them to leave their homeland
For an unknown land
The look upon them, is more barbaric than Conan
They asking for work, and you say 'no man, you can't be trusted'
They walked down your street and get busted
By your so-called justice
Designed to change mines
To put you in the lead, and the others behind
Well I will never try your road again, never vote again
Cause you have used the mass-escape quote again
I'll rate your radio-show again, like once P.E.
Run up in your office screaming and raving
Blame me!
I got the hottest beats out there courtesy of embee
and rhymes with the message to set your mindstate free

Chorus (2x)

This is not a democratic soceity. Notice that that's the opposite of the
standard view about democracy. Nowhere else is people so addicted to information
and entertainment in printed words. Propaganda for democracy is what violence is
for a dictator ship. It's a game for the elites, ehh, it's not for the ignorant masses.</pre>
