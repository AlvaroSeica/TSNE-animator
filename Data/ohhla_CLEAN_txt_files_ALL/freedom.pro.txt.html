I'm here to give a voice to all the blurred faces
the ones who vandalise and disturb neighbours
The ones who go to court and get to legal aid
have no right in society but to keep the evil paid
The ones that are outlawed worse than Reno Raines
and make the average Joe on the street demand cleaner trains
The ones whose history ya'll want to erase
no history's no future, despair in their face
The ones who get beat up by police and toy cops
like my boys got victims of boycotts
you claim they're not political but too me
the whole art form questions private property
A political crime of passion
this one is to my train bombing, train trashing...

Freedom fighters in the streets rock, rock on
fighting for freedom, writing for freedom

Chorus:
I represent the spray paint artist
I can feel your pain and hardships
I know you're workin' the grave yard shift
so you can keep that train yard hit
And though society hate our shit
and love feh build their great star ships
I know as long as your brave heart ticks
It's on your side the creators sits

You're never home sleepin' always out peepin' the yard
you doin' whole cars with no guards
If 5-0 show up do throw ups on po-po's car
you blow up the precinct if they put you behind bars
You're smart, no heart for a system that hates you
you praise true masters like Seen and Phase 2
You amaze crews and do a one man whole train
that'll bring fame to your name like John Coltrane
Disregard cold rain and bad weather you'd better
practice your letters cus you gotta get it better
Yo yo get up get out and do something
you can't sleep cus you wanna become king of bombing
Equipped with bomb ink and the most fat caps
and a walkman with Promoes fat rap

Who can tell you what you can do and can not?
Who can beat you down, smash your face and put on hand cuffs?
Who built the cage and who makes sure you stay in it?
Who can break the law, break your jaw and get away with it?
Who sets up trails when calling you a liar?
Who is out spying preparing train yards with barbed wire?
Who represent the evil with no regret?
Who forget about the people and what punishment we get?
but yo Who is out jumping electric fences?
Who is throwing rocks at hidden camera lenses?
Who is getting raw shitty to get up all city?
who is writing graffiti but never admit that they did it?
Who is discriminated and not told the truth?
Who's affiliated to killers according to the news?
Who goes by the names of Suer, Swob and Jesis
Kaos, Side, Heis, Cake and Obey? Who is on the frontline fighting sodomite?
'ey yo I gotta say peace to my peeps and all of my...
Freedom fighters in the streets...

Chorus

To all my freedom fighters let me see them lighters
if you're fed up with security guards who beat up writers
Fed up with seeing your pieces get buffed
police that's corrupt and leaders that bluff
Fed up with a unjust system
we gotta teach our young ones cuss the system
If you're fed up with the gun busts, cuffs and prisons
then let me see you pump pump up your fist son
Listen, you hear the freedom chimes? playin' at the speed of rhyme
tellin' you to free your mind
Graffiti is a freedom crime, beautiful and revolutionary
suitable for revolutionaries
On that road seldom travelled by the multitude
remember this when the cops come to fuck with you...
