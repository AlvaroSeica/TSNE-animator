[Intro: RZA]
Bodododododo...
Killa Beez control the set, Shaolin Island where you at?
Medina...

[Chorus 2X: RZA]
East coast just hold your set
West coast just hold your set
Dirty south just hold your set
Mid West just hold your set

[RZA]
Nano nano, my fammo, pop more love than Soprano
Carry ammo like Rambo, blow like Tony Montano
Timberlands with no sandals, started off like black Sambo
Talking ham bone, ham bone, having you heard, that we switched the channel
On the neck is gray flannel, Gucci cheese wit the camouflage
HÃ¤agen-Dazs Milano cookies, too hard to handle
Pepperidge Farm distinctive, Godfather like Brando
You, download my flow, on your iPod Nano
Nano nano, from Austin, tea parties in Boston
Spot that dot in your eye, you not a G til I cross 'em

[Chorus: RZA]
Shaolin Island how your set
East coast just hold your set
West coast just hold your set
Dirty south just hold your set

[RZA]
There's no need to cry ya'll, I gauge out your eyeballs
Your family's like 'why ya'll', there's blood on the white wall
The streets wrapped in white sheets, be strapped to my right knee
Twenty feet gorilla niggas, rolling, looking just like me
The jakes came to ID, I don't carry I.D.
You being fed through the vein wit the IV
In your head you're like 'why me', in the bed is where I be
Oh man, between the legs of a dime piece
Tongue kiss her scented breast, her best friend is behind me
Camcorder on WiFi, recorded in widescreen
Sent it to the iJack, to the people on my team
Killa Beez shine, I don't need no bling bling

[Chorus: RZA]
East coast just hold your set
West coast just hold your set
Shaolin Island hold your set
Medina hold your set
East coast just hold your set
Mid West just hold your set
Dirty south just hold your set
Medina, where you at?

[Outro: RZA]
East coast just hold your set
Killa Beez control the set
Shaolin Island, where you at?
Medina, where you at?
Mid West just hold your set
Dirty south just hold your set
Shaolin just hold your set
Medina, where you at?
Boogie Down...
Killa Beez control the set
Shaolin Island, where you at?
Medina, where you at?</pre>
