[Chorus: A-Wax]
I don't really care
If I step up in this smellin' like this
I don't give a shit
If my eyes is red I'm blowin' this L.G.

[A-Wax]
Please believe been a long time since it was a ease to breathe
Please believe been a long time since I seen a seed in weed
Big treez indeed
Got my life like a scene from "Speed"
I'm a fiend for green
Green money
Green bomb used to blow green blunts
Now I'm back to the Swishers
Packs of them bitches
Lungs like *cough sound*
See the boys and I run like *breathing sounds*
Wheezin' and shit
Damn Newport's got my lungs bleedin' and shit
Still pleadin' the fifth
Got a cannabis club plug
Everybody know Wax love dubs like bitches love Wax
Picture that
Yo, picture that

[Chorus]
I don't really care what you think of me and mine
I'mma smoke until I can't no more
I don't really care
If I step up in this smellin' like this
I don't give a shit
If my eyes is red I'm blowin' this L.G.

[B-12]
I smoke big trees with Big Mike, A-Wax, and Dutch
I'm trynna break down the sack in the back of the Lac truck
High as fuck and I'm off of this Gin too
Another reason for some shit to get into
I can't pretend foo
Cuz we been connected
It's the Riderlife gang
So we been protected
Green weed or coke sales
I represent Oakdale
I guess that's why these suckas be ridin' on my coat tails

[Chorus]
I don't really care
If I step up in this smellin' like this
I don't give a shit
If my eyes is red I'm blowin' this L.G.

[Dutch]
They use fingernails to break down the Garcia Vega
Fire that bitch up
Hit it twice then see you later
Blowin' bubbles in that bong
'Til they let the car go
All it take is one 20 dollar sack a indo
You pretend though
Your brown weed has no seeds
Believe me it's purple like green
Cop it from me
At ease
Young soldier we playin' it low key
Servin' 10 pounds of weed
To white boys like N'Sync
Orange pack of Zig-Zags
Keep yo pants on sag
Quarter ounce to blow
We keep the 44 Mag
Jump bad wit a boss
And then you know it's lights out
Matchin' you gram for gram when them Northern Lights out
Come on

[Chorus] x2
I don't really care
If I step up in this smellin' like this
I don't give a shit
If my eyes is red I'm blowin' this L.G.</pre>
