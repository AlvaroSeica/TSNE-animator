I'm The Dollar Taker

[Intro]
King kong is back!

[Dom King / Mystic]
You know me, I'm built never to feel guilt
My will has decided that my rhymin' is ill, but chill
I know a lot of hatin' niggaz is angry
It's them same hatin' niggaz on the side that page me
I'ma certified rider to many or few
Shit I been through can be studied, and covered in school
Birthed from the sperm pool as damn fool
In high school smoke weed then skipped skool
Still graduated, you mothafuckas ain't steppin'
You bout as half ass as the president you elected
Buzzin' and goin' off nigga give me 10 feet
We cuttin' mothafuckas and leasin'em 6 feet
Now let me get back to the main subject, fuck it
Like Xzibit said, "hip hop is hollow"
Fans now a days swish swash shit then swallow
I'm comin' up, bringin' up my city by inches
Bussin a nigga head, like lil scrappy for my riches... so listen

[Chorus: repeat 4X]

[Dom King / Mystic]
When I was younger nigga, I loved hip hop
Seen G's get arrested for listenin' to hip hop
Times have changed, now the game is just that
We gotta hustle for the loot to get up out this shack
Always brag about sellin' crack on tracks
I didn't know these lines could do all of dat
But since the 2pacs, Xzibits and Nases is rare
I gotta xzhibit my strengths, pullin piles of hair
Will I dare to go where no man went?
Cause we livin in a house wit cold air vents?
Make you wonder what happened
The game got kids in the burbs throwin signs and saggin
Dont know shit bout hood dramatics
So fuck the police cause they drug makin transactin'
Y'all ain't got a fraction of my will, my pride
Marijuna smoke in my lungs till I die
Cause when I wake up, only one thing comes to mind
Where the fuck my weed at? so fuck yo rhyme
Just an example hodup

[Bridge: Dom King / Mystic]
This the real, and if you ain't real nigga
then the shit wont appeal, this the real nigga


[Dom King / Mystic]
Y'all heard this before so what makes it different?
Im only a footstep or two from a sentence
Better grab a basketball or purchase a mic
Unless you slangin' caine my nigga by the night you fight
To keep the lights on, keep the hot water runnin'
If you ain't helpin rap, stay the fuck out of it
I love hip hop, it's my life, my soul
Been on The Chronic since 4 years old
Still do it today, while you dudes gettin' paid
Makin' a sing along and ain't got shit to say
You gettin' paid that's coo, but dont ruin a genre
That helped a nigga out when he ain't have no father
I miss tupac too, but niggaz try to rise to occassion
Try to help the game out instead of hatin'
I tell you now, without hip hop I wouldn't be shit
Fuck 26's on every song and shit</pre>
