[Young Broo]
It's paradiseyeah uh huhYoung Brook babyah yeah

Yo yo, we smoke Barry's like we in Hawaii
Dippin' in the CLK it's hard to find me
Then the phone ring it's Bo King
He wanna know 'bout the whole thing
18 karat bars, Fort Knox gold rings
We puppet masters, pullin' the strings, doin' the damn thing
I make it happen over night 50 G's stacked in
So for the weekend I'm relaxin'
Scam on the next plan to make it happen
For show that money you gotta cartwheel and back flip

[Interlude: Young Brook (Timbo King)]
Yeah Young Brook, Fort Knox shit
Aloha (Timbo King)
Play that shit back for me
Welcome (Timbo King)

[Timbo King]
Yo yo, my uncle Wu put me on the Kold Krush
Now I'm at the fever lookin' like the gold rush
Chain swingin', bitches wanna love, phone ringin'
Cuz back then Dappa Dan now on some fly shit
Ride die 84-5 live shit, you should see us
Bo King, Young Brook, move like crooks be
So shies see the ice bezels
Not three, now shells fly
Murder occur, all over evil paper
Sex, crack a Beck's, fuck the pussy
till it's soaken wet, G's up, hoes love me

[Hook: Young Brook]
It's Young Brook, Bo King
And you know the song the hoes sing
Aloha baby yeah every time the phone rings
Aloha baby yeah every time the phone ring
Young Brook yeah

[Young Brook]
Yo, ya sweet niggaz got the game sour
I caught the kite when me and Tre was in Maui
Blowin' out Cali, taking it back like 86 Bally's
Trap you in an alley, pop your top like Ali
I'm on your block with my shines out
Pop shit I pop them nines out
I keep it real everywhere I go
Just like I keep a steel everywhere I go
On the strip tryna see a mill when that paper flow
Get that, double that and watch that paper grow

[Hook: Young Brook]
It's Young Brook, Bo King
And you know the song the hoes sing
Aloha baby yeah every time the phone ring

[Timbo King]
Hawaiian skunk with the dust bizarre inside a Dutch cigar
At a luau, cool out, dip dip dive put a lap or two
We on some Don Juan Perignon same shit the actor do
Separate the real from the fake
This year another mill on my plate
Cuz we dealin' with weight
We love niggaz but they dealin' with hate
Thought we was gone, nah Pah
Still in yo face, hot steel in yo face
We go to war like we suppose to
This ain't the booth or some motherfuckin' Pro Tools
Bang for mines, Brooklyn danger signs
Gettin' murked same place you slang your dimes

[Hook: Young Brook]
It's Young Brook, Bo King
And you know the song the hoes sing
Aloha baby yeah every time the phone rings
Aloha baby yeah every time the phone ring

[Outro: Timbo King]
Palm trees and coconut water
From Brooklyn to Hawaii we cover the order, yeah</pre>
