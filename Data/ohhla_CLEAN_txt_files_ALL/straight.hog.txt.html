[Hook - 2x]
Showing trunk glowing, while I flip through the hood
Big diamonds shining blinding, while I'm gripping my wood
Showing trunk glowing, while I flip through the hood
Straight up-straight up out of Texas, straight up-straight up out of Texas

[Kyleon]
I pull up looking good, hand on that wood sturning
I got that purple po'd, and I got that good burning
I think and then I pull, yeah nigga that's how you learning
I got them Tyra banks, yeah nigga I am earning
My money long, I'm talking football fields
Nigga that's big bread, like I got a football deal
Or contract, whatever y'all call it
Let me insinuate, that nigga Kyle balling
Yeah that's why Kyle crawling, off in that big body
I got that top falling, 4's stick out it
You get a penny for your thoughts, Killa get stacks
I eat till I'm obese, so I sit fat nigga

[Hook - 2x]

[PJ]
What's the deal motherfuckers, hell yeah bitch I'm back
Tipping down the boulevard, in a Fleetwood Lac
Got the fifth falling trunk popping, acting bad on the cops
Candy blue paint, hoes bopping in the parking lot
Sitting sideways, purple stuff got me leaning
All these diamonds on my neck, hell yeah my shit gleaming
I'm a Boss Hogg Outlaw, I'm a Boy N' Blue
The Rap Hustler dick sucker, who the fuck are you
Making change doing my thang, hogging in that turning lane
Pimping hoes tipping 4's, pulling up on them swangs
Ain't no simping in my pimping, ain't no whack off in my mack
Make these hoes break theyself, when I pull up in the Lac

[Hook - 2x]

[J-Dawg]
We rolling 84's, homie
When you see me poking out, I'm repping for the whole block
Behind tint sipping purple drank, smoke inside with G's
Got the rolls still strapped up, big chrome desert eag'
Wood grain gripping, H-Town representing
Them boys looking mad, hate to see a Hogg winning
In a blue line, Northside coming down
Out the roof throwing gang signs, bitch I'ma shine
Banging Big H.A.W.K., a real nigga real talk
God gotta have a plan, but that's real big loss
We gon hold it down though, represent your name
Bang Screw good bang, stay loyal to the game
