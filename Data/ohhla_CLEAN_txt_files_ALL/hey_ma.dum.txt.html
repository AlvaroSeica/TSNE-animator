[Dungeon Masta]
What's up mami? I see you there rocking that Tommy
Hill, by the way, is your first name Lauryn, boo?
Pretty smile, hit it, ah, damn, since you is
Hour glass shape, make a nigga fall ape
You sending messages to Willy Wonka, before I spawn ya
Can I take you the VIP section so I can flaunt ya
Nice toes, smooth skin, caramel complexion
Sweet voice talking shorty, I know you full of affection
Your walk captivate my eye beams, put on my high beams
There's a meeting in my bedroom, can I skeet you with this milky cream?
Candle light after dinner, cheap sipping on bubbly
If you don't then does, then doesn't matter, more for me
Last name Masta, first name Dungeon the demental
With a chosen shorty right there, you got a banging max holding
NOw don't get your head swollen, you little cute
Why don't you, give me your math so we can build on your mental skills

[Chorus: Dungeon Masta]
Hey ma, hey ma, I need to know you
Hey ma, hey ma, your world is over
Hey ma, hey ma, I need to poke you
Hey ma, hey ma, won't you come over

[Dungeon Masta]
What up madam? How you doing? Glad to meet cha
How's your husbands treating ya? Anyway
Do you mind if I take you out?
And after that, we can work something out, I'm feeling you shorty
I love the way you work your hips
You even make Willy Wonka wanna flip, can I poke ya?
I'm just joking right now, it doesn't mean later
What you mean later? You taking off them jeans later?
Yeah, I'm wit that, I got hypnotic and a napsack with the bong
And with some slick shit for me
Now this amongst grown folks, ain't no need for you to be talking
And tell ya friends, the more tits, the merrier

[Chorus]

[Dungeon Masta]
Everything was all good, shit was looking lovely
I even caught feelings when you told you loved me
You got me thinking that no one was above me
Picked me up when I'm down, disrespect to shove me
You said I be the nigga you would cruise wit first
Grow old together, chill and don't need a nurse, ma
I can't imagine, even though it's verse
That my love for you's a gift, I see it as a curse
The way I see you smile is like heaven on earth
And your the reason that's behind Dungeon Masta's rebirth
You took my mental on the low, hit the Zu, got me thinking
Should I ever trust you again, no need for drinking
Your the reason that my ship in the waters are sinking
Love came and gone, the deal is gone, boo, if I'm blinking
When the ship comes down, all my niggas get ready
If you don't know how to swim, you will drown
When the ship comes down, all my niggas get ready
If you don't know how to swim, you will drown

[Chorus]

[Dungeon Masta]
When the ship comes down, all my niggas get ready
If you don't know how to swim, you will drown
When the ship comes down, all my niggas get ready
If you don't know how to swim, you will drown </pre>
