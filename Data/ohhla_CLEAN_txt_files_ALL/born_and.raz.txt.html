(Intro) Razah (Sample)
("I was born and raised in the ghetto")
Heaven Razah
("I was born and raised in the ghetto")
Razah Rubiez
("I was born and raised in the ghetto")
This goes out to all the ghetto's worldwide
We gotta be our own government, know'i'm'sayin?
G.G.O. Officialz

[Hell Razah]
Ayo its combat, gimme ya drums and hard hats
If it's an office or court room burn my contract
Tell these Indies and these Majors I want my songs back
Make your moms buy iPod and download that
(Downloaded) I'm on that 70-30 tilting my derby
These gangstaz be dressed like chicks, they all purty
They smirk like its trustworthy, ready to murk me
I'm poison for the bloodthirsty, begging for mercy
I'm blowing on that sour-diesel, mixed wit Hershey
It hurt me, inert me, rest in peace to Derby
I spit it Heavenly transformed the melodies
Being black is like I'm already born wit felonies
A hundred bars like a centipede, pray for enemies
I got genes in me from the unseen and dead poets, claustrophobic
The one track minds that ain't focused on the culprit

(Sample)
"How do you raise your kids in the ghetto?"
"How do you raise your kids in the ghetto?"
"How do you raise your kids in the ghetto?"
"How do you raise your kids in the ghetto?"

[Hell Razah]
I've been sick since '86, low fades and toothpicks
Duce flicks wit rope chains, we shoot shit
Desert Eagles and blue Evisu's get in your skin like drug needles
Yeah I spit it lethal, like gleam off the bright lean
It's mayday when I AK your right wing
Hoes swallowing my cum like ice cream
I'm in the white Beam 745 wit 745's
I look at shawty's eyes and see befo we die
Call me Billy Butcher, when I'm throwing knives
King Solomon son wit 700 wives, 700 .9's
My man Ra got the third floor boiling raw
Slipped the crack money under the door

(Outro) Razah
Hurry up, hurry up
Yo who da fuck is that knocking at the door son?
Ayo hurry up, hurry up
Word up, niggas money betta not lost
Yo you spilling shit, you spilling shit son
Brooklyn
When you look at the projects you see the pain of the people
That has a lot of power of what goes on in the ghetto
Therefore we gon' form a government, know'what'I'mean?
Renaissance Child, Razah Rubiez, Heaven Razah
Ain't no more Hell Razah, look at my bones, study me</pre>
