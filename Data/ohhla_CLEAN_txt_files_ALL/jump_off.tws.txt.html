[Intro]
(Twista) Twista
Uhh (yeah) F5 (baby)
What's up lil' mama? (tasty)
You know when I pick you up in that SLR
And take you to the 5-star telly, it's about to

[Chorus]
Jump off (Girl you can get it)
Jump off (Whenever you're ready)
Jump off (Then go 'head and let it)
Jump off (Yeah girl I said it)
Jump off {Boy come and get it}
Jump off {I am so ready}
Jump off {Time that we let it}
Jump off {Yeah boy I said it}

[Twista]
I got a couple of stacks
I got a couple of sacks, I got a couple of blunts
I got a cup full of 'tr√≥n, I'm fin' to bug in the zone
Lookin for a girl that'll let me get up in them thongs
Uh, damn I don't know which woman to pick
When I look at them I can see every one of them thick
They all wanna find out who a nigga comin to get
Because the Hummer is slick, and they want some of the dick
Uh, when you see the Twista comin around
I'm always stompin the ground, and for a woman abound
And I be runnin with hounds, and we'll be huntin 'em down
And when I catch 'em you know that I'ma be bustin 'em down
Then I - run off
Hot girls I gots ta - bump off
Who ain't scared to leave me - slumped off
She make sure I get my - nut off
And that's why I love her

[Chorus]

[Twista]
Hustle mode, I'ma cookin a brick
And if I'm in killer mode then I'm dumpin a clip
And if I'm in party mode I'ma stomach a fifth
And if I be in freaky mode then I'm fuckin a bitch
Uh, I love hoes that be ready to holla
When I pull up on them in that black Chevy Impala
Gotta get 'em if they lookin bottom heavy and Prada
and they wear Fendi and dollar but they be ready to swallow
Uh, when we hit the after party we lightin them up
And who I'm rollin with me is gon' have to get buck
I need somebody I can call in the mornin for sex
I need somebody I can call up after the club
Come off - with them drawers 
and then I bust off - in them jaws 
and get me - one off
I'm strapped so I'm lovin - jump off
When I'm rollin with my

[Chorus] - 2X

[Twista]
I score the pussy like a touchdown
Cause she can jump off, I'm gonna touch now
It ain't a bad thing, you gotta trust me baby
You's a busty baby, you're a bustdown
Uh, somebody you can get up with anytime of the night
Actin like a fiend when she be grabbin the pipe
Smokin green while you servin the white
She the conservative type, but never nervous to fight
Uh, I got the head hunter that's comin to get me
Suckin on the dick until it was formin a hickey
Me and her be like servin the soda or
mixin the Formula 44 with the Formula 50
Skunked off
A cup cause I got me - one off
I can't hear like I cut the - drum off
I'm feelin like I got my - drunk off
And that's why I love her

[Chorus] - 2X</pre>
