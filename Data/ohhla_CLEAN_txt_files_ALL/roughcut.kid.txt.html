Song:  Rough Cut
Typed by: Matt Jost

There's no time to lay a rap about the cold hard streets
People strugglin hard just tryina make ends meet
I just stand tough, hold down my beat
Never understand the meaning of the word 'defeat'
So you say it's like that and that's the way it is
But when I'm on the microphone it goes somethin like this
Body-breakin, booty-shakin, the money for the makin
You just put it in my pocket cause you know I gotta take it

It's rough, it's tough
Let me see if you can hack my stuff

It's rough, rough, rough, rough

It's rough, it's tough
We gonna rock you till you get enough

It's rough
It's rough

Russians got a thing about shooting down planes
They did it before, now they're doin it again
Can't you see that this world is comin to an end?
I wish that everyone would just go make friends
You're tellin me shit about the friendly skies
But to me it's all just a big pack of lies
Sit at your TV set, get all hypnotized
But it's about time that you realized

It's rough, it's tough
We gonna rock you till you get enough

It's rough, it's tough

Let's rough, so tough
Let me see if you can hack my stuff

Rough, rough, rough, r...

When sucker MC's try to be like me
Let me tell you in this world how it's gonna be
If you need some help you better call your mom
Cause I'ma stick to your ass like bubble gum
I'm one MC and you know I'm fly
Yeah take it from me, just a average guy
I've got a funky feeling, I tell you why
The rapper guaranteed to take you to the do or die

Well I'm Kid Frost
Well I'm, well I'm, well I'm...
Well I'm Kid Frost, the rappin boss
And on the mic can make your body to a stand-toss
Rockin on the beat called the body rock
And takin women home until the panties drop
( ? ) by her very last dollar
Then I'm down on the beat to make the women all holler

It's rough, it's tough
Let me see if you can hack my stuff

It's rough
It's rough

It's rough, it's tough
We gonna rock you till you get enough

It's rough, rough, rough, rough

Funky rough breadown</pre>
