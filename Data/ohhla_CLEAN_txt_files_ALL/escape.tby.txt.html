Song:   Escape
Typed by: Young Tob

oye! 
señores y señoras! 
escuche la música! 
escapar en la noche! 
ven conmigo! 

get up, get up, no one can hold me down 
get up, get up, no one can hold me down 
get up, get up, no one can hold me down 
get up, get up, no one can hold me down 

(hook) 
run away with me into the empty night 
drown out all the worries of a restless mind 
come escape 
leave it all behind 
say goodbye a little while 
and let it go, go, go, go, go, go 

get up, get away 
at least for the evening find a better place 
tired of struggling every day 
escape, escape, escape 
might take a drink or two 
to find a relaxed state to sink into 
where you don't have to wait to think it through 
I need a break, a break, a break 
someone turn the music loud 
dance like a fool, don't care who's around 
all the fear is losing ground 
the wine goes in, the truth comes out 
let the instinct play the strings 
in the tune of a melody that makes you sing 
that song of escaping things 
to run, run, run away with me 

(hook) 
run away with me into the empty night 
drown out all the worries of a restless mind 
come escape 
leave it all behind 
say goodbye a little while 
and let it go, go, go, go, go, go 

got nothing to get off my chest 
got no debts, regrets, or the stress 
still there's tension left on my breath 
till the woman that caused it sets it to rest 
dancing body pressed to my chest 
her breath on my neck like an echo 
it gets so I let go 
in the moment forgetting the steps 
move yourself and get away 
move yourself and liberate 
eyes closing feels like the time's frozen 
get down! 
completely in the now 
got the drums speaking to me loud 
finding my freedom in the sound 
run, run, run away with me 

run away with me into the empty night 
drown out all the worries of a restless mind 
come escape 
leave it all behind 
say goodbye (say goodbye)</pre>
