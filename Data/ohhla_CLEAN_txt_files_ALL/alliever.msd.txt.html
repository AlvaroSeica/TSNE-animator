[Verse One]
When I'm with you I only feel completness
I can feel taste on my lips
It's so hard to conceal the weakness caused by your fingertips
If I told you just how deep my lovin' really goes for you
And that you got all my trust
If you knew tell me what would you do?

[Chorus]
All I ever wanna do is love you
That's why I take the time to make it special
Night after night
Night after night
Everything I have is yours only yours
Bothing ever touched my soul like this before
Feels so right
Feels so right

[Verse Two]
Now if I told you that you're worth the world and all it's love to me
If I told you that I wanna birth a family with you some day
If I told you that I wanna grow old together what would you say?
If I was to let you know I wanna see forever with you
Would you run away?

[Repeat Chorus]

If I told you I wanna be your drive
Your strength and courage when your weak
I send my angels out every night to protect you from the street
If you knew I'd sacrafice almost everything to keep you happy
Would you let me love you for life
It's all I want It's all I need

[Repeat Chorus Till Fade]</pre>
