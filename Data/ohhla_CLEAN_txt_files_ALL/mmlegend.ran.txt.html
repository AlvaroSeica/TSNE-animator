[Chorus]
Wilson giving y'all Mega Man raps
This right here will make every fan snap
The folks that try copycat my style are wack
That kinda rap belongs in the junkyard scraps

[Verse]
All the haters in the game can get a cannon buster
..By the kid with the shiny luster
The blue bomber is my nick name
Rock man in Tokyo that's also a sick name
..My call of duty is get lames
Watch it up close like a court side knick game
Bad guys hate it when the A-R spit
I am shooting everywhere like JR Smith
I'm something you can't detect no radar glitch
Your fam will value this...Tamar clips
..I tried to tell y'all that this nerd hot
I stay with a crew around me....servebots
Shout out to Richie Branson for the rebel music
The bass goes hard plus he put some treble to it
...If the folks got that
Congrats you can understand robot rap!

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Wilson giving y'all Mega Man raps
This right here will make every fan snap
The folks that try copycat my style are wack
That kinda rap belongs in the junkyard scraps

[Verse 2]
Dr light flow I stay in the damn kitchen
Cookin ideas cuz I have that mans vision
Salty MCs in the game stay dissin
That's the reason why Im on a command mission
Eliminate all wack rappers on site
I don't really care if it takes me all night
I should win an artist award..breakthrough
Cuz This song right here is gonna make you
Jump jump slide slide
Jump jump slide slide
Jump jump slide slide
Jump jump slide slide
I had to do this for the fans son
Now I'm gonna pass the Mega Man raps back to random

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Wilson giving y'all Mega Man raps
This right here will make every fan snap
The folks that try copycat my style are wack
That kinda rap belongs in the junkyard scraps</pre>
