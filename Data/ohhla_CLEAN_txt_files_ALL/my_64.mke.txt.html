Cruisin down the street in my 6 4
jockin the bitches, slappin a hoe
Went to the park to get the scoop
knuckleheads out there, cold, shootin some hoops
Cruisin down the street in my 6 4, jockin a bitch, jockin a bitch
Cruisin down the street in my (who), jockin a (Mike Jones, Jones, Jones)

[Mike Jones]
Well I'm cruisin down the street in my candy painted low (low)
bouncin like a door, with 4 on my 6 4's
I pull up wood grippin, doors tippin sittin low
I'm hittin sixteen switches watch it stop and hit the floor
I'm leanin on the curb sippin syrup blowin dro
the girls show me love when they panties hit the floor
I said I'm leanin on the curb sippin syrup blowin dro
I got the 6 4 hoppin, watch it stop and do a show
First I lean wit it, then I rock wit it
I got a candy apple drop wit a glock in it
First I lean wit it, then I rock wit it
I got a candy apple drop wit a glock in it
First I lean, then I rock, (mike jones)
first I lean, then I rock, (I said)
First I lean wit it, then I rock wit it
I got a candy apple drop wit a glock in it
(because I'm)

Cruisin down the street in my 6 4, jockin a bitch, jockin a bitch
Cruisin down the street in my 6 4, jockin a bitch, jockin a bitch
Cruisin down the street in my 6 4, jockin a bitch, jockin a bitch
Cruisin down the street in my, (Bun B) jockin a bitch

[Bun B]
It's Bun B
I'm known for slammin cadillac doors
Comin down on that kandy
With them swanger and them 4's
But I got love for the west coast (all day)
so I suppose I'm-a head out to Cali
the land of the low lows
Touchdown to L-A-X and I don't need no car
Robbie Chino pick me up with the bud and the bar
In the hood I'm-a star
so to the hood i'm-a go
with mike Jones and Snoop Dogg
and they already know
Then I get love from the B's
love from the C's
Mexican, Asian that's a more of O G's
Throw it up when they see me
and holla Ay Bun
When I'm comin out as soon as ansy gray one
You might see me at long beach
OR MAYBE PASADENA
Inglewood I E or West COVINA
a southside ride with the homie big Kun
car hoppin, top droppin
the gettin get good when I'm

Cruisin down the street in my 6 4, jockin a bitch, jockin a bitch
Cruisin down the street in my 6 4, jockin a bitch, jockin a bitch
Cruisin down the street in my 6 4, jockin a bitch, jockin a bitch
Cruisin down the street in my (Snoop Dogg) jockin a bitch

[Snoop Dogg]
Big Snoop Dogg with a yellow paris hiny
with two girlies in the back in they crip blue bikinis
shakin and they jumpin cause the duece keep bouncin
tippin, whippin, thats it, steady dippin
Candy paint drippin and these axels want a sippin
As I shake like a dice game
Cold as the ice age
Mike Jones rockin like a rollin stone
It's Snoop Dogg boy I'm B-B-Bad to the bone
Yea them Cali boyz
We love them low lows
an real car club niggas bang they low doors
and take fo tows
See everything is fine
I'm in the 64
A 60 trail a 59
I love my car
like I love my wife
See lowridin aint a sport
its a way of life
On the real dough I'll tell you how it feel though
If you see me in the fo creepin slow yo</pre>
