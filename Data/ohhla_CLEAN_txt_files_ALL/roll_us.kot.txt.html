Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Ha let's get this session moving break
Out the Bob Marley music you got a
Paper and can I use it
After I twist this up we can smoke it
Together man I wanna stay high forever
We got cloudy weather
In the forecast in the room I'm
Occupying we be getting stoned and
Flying we be doing donuts while
I'm eating crispy creams drinking on a
Starbucks living the American dream

Yo, smoking kush the west coast is in
The building my town in the house
Blow the bomb to the ceiling
Hanging down in Cali kicking flows
Catching feeling dealing with some
Prime time feds chronic killing
Ripping J Ziggy J stone town feelings
Leaning back to my cat I'll be rolling haze
Whatcha wanna say I like being fazed
Bang it loud how we do light it up stoney days

Do you wanna get high?
Yes, we do!
Do you live life loaded?
Whoodewhoo!
The show me what your working
With and roll us a joint
Kottonmouth in the house keep
The session on point
[x2]

Yeah I stay loaded I keep it punk rock
My bank account stays loaded
It's tough here at the top
Just playing y'all
I'm about to open up shop drop another
Fucking dope rhyme
Right up on your spot only the I'll-est can
Smoke up on my pot
And the only the realist can sniff from my crop
Only the dealers are allowed on this block
And only the kings have a key to the lock

Stop, Hey what's that sound? Does
Anybody look what's going down?
Kottonmouth kings smoking 25
Pounds (green) blowing like a hurricane
Through your town
Woop woop that's the sound of the
Police and I don't know why they
Keep harassing me
I just wanna burn these ganja trees
And live in peace so come and sing with me

Do you wanna get high?
Yes, we do!
Do you live life loaded?
Whoodewhoo!
The show me what your working
With and roll us a joint
Kottonmouth in the house keep
The session on point
[x2]

I gotta brand new pipe and a brand
New case that I got in Humble Yo
Who wanna blaze
Who wanna taste of new strains I call
This Die hard cause it you go John micaline
I got the smokey too make you go
Cookoo have you up on the roof in a pigeons coop
So many new types to try and I
Wanna try them all so I headed over to the weed mall

Doctor, Doctor your never gonna
Guess after elevated line becoming
Far more than a test
It's a remedy for the down times of
Depression everybody get your best
Bud have a session smoke tough
Demonstrate how your flying and if
You claim you have the best weed
Stop lying matter of fact wait for me
Let me learn ya I got the most bomb
And I'll never ever learn ya

The birds eyes fazed flying high on the
Seen super dog style I got the super
Duper green tell me whatcha need a
Big bag of seeds I plant these trees
Like Christmas trees doing daily tokes on DTV
Will sling these leafs like west coast G's
Yeah I'll smoke my pot I'm Slinging these
Trees like west coast G's

Do you wanna get high?
Yes, we do!
Do you live life loaded?
Whoodewhoo!
The show me what your working
With and roll us a joint
Kottonmouth in the house keep
The session on point
