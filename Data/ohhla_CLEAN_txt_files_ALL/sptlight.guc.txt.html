[Intro: Usher]
It feels so good to be back! {Yeah}
Polow, Ursher baby {Zone 4}
Oh-oh-oh-ohhhhhhhhhhh! (Uhh uhh)
How you doin Gucci? (Yeahhhh)
(Huh) {Zone 6} (huh)

[Chorus 2X: Usher]
Cause the spolight, ain't nothin without ya girl
And the dance floor, ain't nothin without ya girl
You a show-stopper, whoa! Let's get it poppin, whoa!

(Ay, ay, Gucci!)

[Gucci Mane]
Rose by the fifty, uhhh, now she tipsy
Slow dancin in my mansion with no panties want to get me
Three girls Gucci trippin, that's a lot of women
Expensive denim jeans on, designer heels you feel me?
(Hey, hey, get money!) I don't want no violence but damn she tryin to kill me
She tryin to make me feel her, I'm tryin to make her feel me
She just had a long day, know I got that long cake
I give her that long stroke, I fuck with her the long way

[Chorus]

[Gucci Mane]
Bay-bay, o-kay-kay, where you wana go today?
No, she not a prostitute but if she was I'd have to pay
Say, lay, you can stay? I sex you a couple days
Tell yo' girl no need to front, she want to participate
Gucci on Elimidate, fo' girls with me
Simply I glaze they ass just like some Church's biscuits
Beat her like she stole my Bentley, swagger jackers pay attention
Cali girl, A-T-L, Detroit New York girls be with me

[Chorus]

[Gucci Mane]
I had a girl left alone, Gucci Mane's a bachelor
Sex tape just like Pamela, cause Gucci not an amateur
Mini-skirt, sun dress, booty shorts, monster
Her ass fat as two basketballs, Gucci fin' to dunk her
Pretty like Mariah, finer than Alicia
Sexy just like Trina dog, I bet she a keeper
Turn me on like Keri, uh, no she is not scary, uh
Probably sex her every, uh, cause lil' momma is fine as fuck

[Chorus]</pre>
