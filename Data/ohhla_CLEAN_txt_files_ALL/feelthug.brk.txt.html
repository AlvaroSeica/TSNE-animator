(Interlude) Goldie Mack
From East to West Coast we get it popping
Only like a broad if she take me shopping
Bang this in your club; Daddy Rose got the beat knocking
We VIP popping bottles with the team watching
 
(Chorus) Elohim
Yo, show love I know you're feeling my thug
Up in the club seen you grilling my mug
Acting up 'cause I was feeling your bub
Peep me then I was still in the club
I'm singing though are we chilling or what?
 
[Goldie Mack]
Yo I'm a gorgeous gangster, shorty you recognize in G'ing me
You ain't slick thinking you're G'ing me
But yo, how you gon' game a gamer?
If your girl out of line I'll tame her
Got a degree in Womenology
Disrespect Goldie, I'll have you begging my apology
You'll probably think it's alright 'cause you're a dime piece
But you know I get 'em by the truck loads
Now you wanna make it up to me and suck toes
Talking about how you liked the boots I got you
I'm like fuck those, pigeons gossip how I be fronting
Like they got enough money to buy me something
 
(Chorus) Elohim
 
[Baracus]
What up ma you fucking or what?
Yo Cash wanna get sucked in the truck
Who paying cash for you slut?
Calling you off in the club trying to master your cut
What are y'all gangsters or what?
Living it up, Kartel pop shells, niggas giving it up
Kartel Rose under the pale known for being hell
With me and dollar bills, and hate county jails
Stick up fiends, and hit county's grill
Holla hoe to my home, yo get Daddy dealt
Before warrants pop up, FEDS gon' pop up
Can't get Daddy now, fuck your man take his stash
And meet my man Cash in a half
Bitch better get Daddy help
Empty large amounts from my accounts
If you're feeling me boo make it count
Cop an ounce, make them clowns bounce
Take them clowns ounce
 
(Chorus) Elohim
 
[Goldie Mack]
Since I've been making moves broads hollering "where you been at?"
I'm like "yeah-yeah, what ever baby girl, where your friend at?"
Them sap rap what you got for me bitch send that
Where that at, bitch ba-dat-dat
I feel you G funk, from here to Long Beach
Gangsters know how we pump
Rose got guns for thugs, dicks for hoes
DeVille keep a nigga on his tippy-toes
I want cake, dumb bitch want to get me clothes
That's why I hit the club and bag some hot shit
I mean what could you possible do for me ma?
You ain't got shit, you used to pop shit
Now you get top-lifts, uh-huh and strip for a nigga
But your money ain't right, you can't do shit for a nigga
But anyways I'm feeling that one, your son tapper
Tryna get at her, iced out, plus her ass fatter
And her mind like money wild, see me getting mad numbers
Now she acting funny style
 
(Interlude) Goldie Mack
From East to West Coast we get it popping
Only like a broad if she take me shopping
Bang this in your club; Daddy Rose got the beat knocking
We VIP popping bottles with the team watching
