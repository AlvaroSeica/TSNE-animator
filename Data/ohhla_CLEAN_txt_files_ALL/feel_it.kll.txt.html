"It's not that I don't love you, you know how much I do" - Willie Clayton

[Intro: Dom Pachino (female singer) {9th Prince}]
Yea, Killarm'
This one here's for the people
{Word up}(on the inside)
The families livin in the ghetto (To make you fell it)
Babies, we're right there with you, yeah (On the outside, to make you feel it)
Puerto Rico (On the inside) {Japan, Africa} (To make you feel it)
Word up

[Dom Pachino]
Have you ever seen a grown man cry?
Have you ever asked a grown man, "Why?
Why do you feel that way inside?"
Sometimes I had to swallow my pride
And settle for less
Lord, don't settle for less
You more like the best
To me, as I pulled my head out my skully
and I give crazy dues to those who mean somethin to me
Moms, you incredible, you raised me all by yourself
Regardless of the situation, there was food on the shelf
Pops, you abandoned me, you left me all alone
In this cold war zone, I had to fends for my own
My sister Candy, probably the only one that understands me
Girl I love you to death, you never turned your back on me
La familia's sick, I wish I had the hands to heal ya quick
And rid you of a disease you're livin with
A young father, I've been blessed with 2 little girls
You's a jewels' more precious than diamonds and pearls
A power of me from a different perspective
And any woman that I'm dealin with is gonna have to respect it
On the outside there's negativity, please kill it
Cuz on the inside, me and my team'll make ya feel it (To make you feel it)

[Interlude: 9th Prince (female singer)]
(On the outside) Word up
(To make you feel it)
It's like everyday is a struggle (On the inside)
(To make you feel it)
Like flowin in the borough
(On the outside)
Runnin over rocks, sticks and stones
(To make you feel it)
And all that (On the inside)
(To make you feel it)
Eh-yo..

[9th Prince]
Eh-yo, "Mom, I'm suspended from school"
"Boy, I'm tired of your shit"
Black woman drivin the mothership
On the company with your name incorporate'
She told me I was handsome, I knew I looked funny with big lips
But that's the love she had for her son, the 9th Prince
Forever you exist in my circumference
Left my brain numbless
At night sometimes I cry
Wipe the salty tears from my eyes and realise
Lies gon' die, you're caught up in the Bee Hive
But mom, ever since you've been gone, ain't nuttin changed
RZA got a new Range, I can't complain
The fake cats stay in they lane
And grant more than delicate, it's gettin bigger
More figures I gotta spend on Princess Carithea
Pull, avoid pictures
Back from the canals ghetto prisoners
Let's all hold hands and sing for the listeners
I know you're feelin us

[Interlude: Islord (female singer) {Willie Clayton}]
{It's not that I don't love you}
First.. shit is just that real
(To make you feel it)
You know what I mean? Shit is different
{It's not that I don't love you}
(To make you feel it)
Just everythin, run up in the ghetto and shit, you know?
Like sometimes it's just.. (To make you feel it)
Sometimes.. word..  it's like..(To make you feel it)
It's like somethimes (To make you feel it)

[Islord]
Sometimes I catch myself sittin back
scratchin my nail over my head, thinkin about where I'm at, black
Trapped in the worst part
I guess so son, shit is fucked up though
The type of shit a young black man gotta go through
Everyday of his life
No matter where we at, they say we sell crack
Yea, we do, son, so what do you expect us to do about it?
I gotta eat, I ain't tryin to starve government
I know you lovin it
Got us like rats in labs
Just watchin us fade away in the sand
Like a rainy day, so what the fuck the President gotta say?

[samples: female and (male) singers]
We'll make you Feel It on the outside
(It's not that I don't love you)
Make you Feel It on the inside
(You know how much I do)
Make you Feel It on the outside
Make you Feel It on the inside
Make you Feel It..

[Killa Sin]
Yo one life
One love, to the next chamb' kid

Eh-yo I walked a fine line divided by right and wrong
Misguided at times, dissatisified not understandin my youth
The truth I'm goin through it, for real God, I need solutions
'cause it seems like a brotha like me can't win for losin'
Figured if I put my all into it than it's all fluid
Let them other brothas speed-ball 'cause I'ma crawl through it
Mama said, "Take ya time young man but do it right"
I promise to even if it takes the rest of my life
Long as I have breath in my lung and death is yet to become
I will rep 'til I'm done, that's it, never submit
and if ya have a problem with this, please reveal it
but the truth bein deep down inside, I know you Feel It

[Outro: female singer {Willie Clayton}]
On the outside {It's not that I don't love you}
To make you Feel It, on the inside
{You know how much I do}
To make you Feel It, on the outside
To make you Feel It, on the inside
To make you Feel It, on the outside
{It's not that I don't love you}
To make you Feel It, on the inside
{You know how much I do}
To make you Feel It, on the outside
{It's not that I don't love you}
To make you Feel It, on the inside
{You know how much I do}
To make you Feel It</pre>
