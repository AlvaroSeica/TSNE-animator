[Bronze Nazareth]
Bronze Nazareth rap to capture, stab you backwards
Mist in Michelin, adverbs stab worse than militia in black dirt
My raps squirt poison, Attica's finch ploys when
Sins spin from my pen like spider web
There's no higher celeb than he who impresses himself
Like the flutes in the foreground
I'm dirty like Detroit buildings tore down
One more round and you down
But the thirst hasn't begun yet, my gun get tongue in the way
It's hard to shoot sometimes, spin lines like Rumpelstiltskin
I slump and peel men from earth like they did send
Who wanna test my next verse? A 'Blade Trilogy'
Filling me with soliloquies
Hitting like __ into your metal facilities
Fuck you niggas up, spill the beans and I still eat them
Trouble since we first got freedom
'Cause freedom had an AK and passed it to ____
Okay I'm reloaded, the streets don't know it
My beats flow rich, clap and cut like bow rigs
The super curs, defeat you easier than super sluts
Deluxe handcuffs, precincts stand up when I'm arrested
Double barrel bronze but he was double chested
The heart, the ribcage, chest and solar plexus</pre>
