[The Jet Age of Tomorrow]
It all was a, crazy time
You ready but you ain't mine
For me you was out your mind
You're lookin fine but I was so blind
To you, I just want a ride
To use so I just step inside
It's mine, it's just you and me
Come on, this is ecstasy - you'll see

{*various voices overlap - some say "Atlantis"*}

[The Jet Age of Tomorrow]
You hesitate
You wanna fly so we just levitate
No air, you gave this some time
You're not around, so you're just on my mind
Just you, I go really deep
I am so deep that I am out of reach
From Earth, do you really care
Just come with me where there is no air - no time to stare
