If you can save me now
Let's go somewhere safe and sound
I'll try not to weigh you down
But I don't know if I can wait around
If you can save me now
Let's go somewhere safe and sound

It happened fast like a camera flash
The accident, then the aftermath
I'm not even sure what caused the crash
If I had the strength, I would probably laugh
I'm so relaxed, warm like blood
Laying on my back in the sun-dried mud
There's no point in even trying to get up
I got my eyes glued to the blue sky above
And it's been a beautiful summer
It reminds me of when I was younger
Used to count down to the sound of thunder
I smell fresh cut grass with the burnt rubber
And I don't need to take a glance to know
cause I can hear the traffic as it passes slow
They on the other side of the window
Checking out the damage, looking at the show
I can hear the sirens get near
Mama used to tell us to plug our ears
It gets so loud and clear
until every other noise disappears
And right now I'm trying to block it out
by imagining the sounds that come out your mouth
I saw two birds fly south
and I thought about the day we bought that house
Memories seem so real
Just like everything that I feel
Tried to coast on all five wheels
I wanna cry, I keep the tears concealed
I hear voices, footsteps
A cop's radio off to the left
The noise made me reflect
Somewhere along the way I must have caught my breath
Drifting, dreaming
and then I heard somebody screaming
But I don't even wanna know the reason
So I kept my focus on the view I'm seeing
Started thinking bout the ones that's gone
Everybody from the past that passed on
You play your cards, had to stand strong
But it ain't that hard to sing a sad song
We've all got scars and broken parts
But most of the marks stay close to my heart
Waiting for the downpour to start
The rainclouds over my head got dark
And then I saw my angel cut through the storm
She was in a firefighter uniform
I closed my eyes so I could see some more
and for the first time ever I remember being born

If you can save me now
Let's go somewhere safe and sound
I'll try not to weigh you down
But I don't know if I can wait around, I say
If you can save me now
Let's go somewhere safe and sound
I'll try not to weigh you down
But I don't know if I can wait around, I say

But I don't know if I can wait around, I say

I'll try not to weigh you down
But I don't know if I can wait around, I say
If you can save me now</pre>
