[JoJo Pellegrino]
Pella is nice as it gets, so as they call me
Sleep on me end up like Balboa in Part 1, kid is a bum
And where I'm from they need higher chips than just crumbs
So I ride with clippers, get funds and supply the pithiest slums
In case you thinkin' only white kids whip them with guns
Was the cops who greatly mistakes and fire pistols for sums
My hood is like your hood, robberies, killings and runs
Earners and burners, crack coke, wires, snitches and cunts
Federal agents make fathers switch on their sons
Pretty chicks ridin' with chopped up bricks in their buns
Louie tied up pricks for his ones
Gladiator Italian cat, loves rap and told me, "Jo, competition is none"
A wise man said gangsters got muscle, mobsters got brains
The cemetery's full of tough guys rottin' in graves
This kid tried to stick me up, I walked in his project for haze
I came back the followin' day and hit his block with grenades
Now piece to all my family locked in the cage
And smell me like when the body decays. the rapper play me
I take a bat to his arms and his legs
And to the kid who murked my man J.D. get, hope you get popped in the face
Now on the behalf of London I'd like to say, "fuck snitches"
And winos stop wearin' the same shit everyday
Jail, jail, moosey, I'm like Smithsonian
Piece, Cam, J.R., Jimmy, Santana, Big Joe and them, what?</pre>
