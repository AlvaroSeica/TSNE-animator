Yeah, yeah, yeah
You my lil' G, my lil' G
He's just a lil' old me
You just a lil' Dom P

(Hook) 2x
I'm a teach you about your birds and your bees
Your ABC's, your 1-2's and 3's
Cuz you my lil' G, my lil' G
He's just a lil' old me
You just a lil' Dom P

Yo, on my way to the hospital, I just missed my flight
On my way to Colombia to rock 'em for the night
My girl running labor, right about the same time
I got a family to feed, so I gotta make a dime
Shit happens for a reason, so it musta been a sign
From a Higher Power - I Self Lord Am Master (ISLAM)
All I can think about was can my car any faster?
Right across the Verrazano, to the county of kings
A brand new, I'm about to be born, if you know what I mean

That's my lil' G, my lil' G
That's my lil' G, my lil' G
Yeah

[Dom Pachino]
I did it again, the rebirth of a General
Let's just hope this time he's not a criminal
Just an intellectual street
Individual that sees things clear
For what they are and not for what they appear
I'm here, beside you, my light will guide you
And son you gon' shine
There's nothing that can hide you
Only tryna find you and I'm not gon' lie to you
With knowledge I provide you
When I looked in your eyes
My son, I looked inside you and seen me
Just a better version on a route in a better Excursion

(Hook) 2x</pre>
