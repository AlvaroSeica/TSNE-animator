Typed by: DaSun Akbar

(Intro)
I feel like they stealing my soul out here
Man, I don't know what they believe in, man
Kno'm'sain?
We've tried everything
Son, I was worshipping rocks for a minute
Shit, what the fuck, kno'm'sain?
Must be CREAM

[Chief Kamachi]
Yo I'm from the dunya
Where losing life don't mean nothing to ya
You still wallowing in my misery
Praying for to deliver us
Looking at the sky wondering why the angels don't visit me?
I've searched for so long, that I slapped the wind crazy
Screaming "Fuck you Lord"
Cuz mommy dead and you let the state take her babies
And I'm starting to think the Church stealing my gravy
Is it so? Is it so?
Cuz if it is than me and you need to rap
Cuz I done wasted all these years
And for you fucking up a little child's head like that

(Hook) 2x
I was searching for something that wasn't there
Giving all my love to something that didn't care
Felt like my faith and destiny was in the air
And the rest of me was here
Still searching

[Chief Kamachi]
They say the meek shall inherit the Earth
But ain't no goods in my hood
And I stroll past a boarded up Church
And you expect me to believe that the Lord is at work?
Pay tithes, nigga, I ain't gotta dime for that jerk
A hungry man don't eat off no Biblical excerpt
And he don't pray, he just hope that his vest work
In the dunya
Where they won't hesitate to tomb ya
Don't cope and from aldehyde fume ya
You wear your cross, but do it give you power?
Look at your environment
Your grandmom in Church every Sunday
The Preacher pay but she's 75 and can't think about retirement

(Hook) 2x

(Outro)
Now put that in your fucking collection plate
Been damn near lost my fucking mind out here
Fucking wit'chall, man
And these fucking religions, man
I'm fucking God
And what the fuck you think about that?
It's the Mic Messiah! Chief Kamach!
Cult Status! Nah'mean! Philadelphia!
