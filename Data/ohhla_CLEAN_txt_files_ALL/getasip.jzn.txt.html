[J-Zone]
Damn man, can't find my St. Ides commercials tapes nowhere
Damn what's on this tape here?
{*scratched: "Is it also true that he was quite drunk?"*}

[Chief Chinchilla]
Ay bartender, ay nigga
Pour me a glass of St. Ides, and a side order of escargot

Chief Chinchilla, the onion ring pimp
Take a bitch to White Castle, fuck lobster and shrimp
And when we drink we don't drink Moet
Pull up to the sto' (fool tell 'em what'chu get)
Motherfuckin St. Ides, forty ounce or a can
Mix it with sake when I drink in Japan
Bitch asked for a sip, I damn near choked
She asked do I drink, 8 Ball or Miller? WHAT?!
("You done fucked up the game!")
Chief Chinchilla bag bitches by the five
With a little White Castle and a little St. Ides
Give it to me

{Hey Chief! Can I get a sip?} Bitch hell no!
{*scratched: "drink up"*}
{Hey Chief! Can I get a sip?} Bitch hell naww!

{Yo Chief! Can I get a sip?} Bitch hell no!
{*scratched: "drink up"*}

[Outro]
"I'm drunk, so what?" "Okay we're roll"
"Let's get drunk, and throw up in the car" {*laughter*}
