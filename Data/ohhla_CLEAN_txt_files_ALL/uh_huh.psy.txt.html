[NewSense] 
NewSense, shit I wear a towel coat 
Ain't no need to sport the fancy shit 
Cuz I gotta keep it on the downlow 
I'm watchin this nigga, and I know he watchin me 
But he don't know that I'm watchin back 
And I'm strapped 
And my nigga YungBuk got my back 
So pray his motherfuckin soul to keep 
I'm a watch these skeezers as they skeeze 
And these homies as they beepers beep 
Damn, oh fuck, hell, shit my boys dead 
What caused the blood shed 
Two to the forehead 

[YungBuk] 
Comin from this young motherfucka died from this infrared 
Of a nine 380 
Or did I use the pump instead 
I really don't remember 
Because I'm hooked on aeronautics 
And I'm so good, nobody else heard 
Nobody else saw it 
It really don't matter 
I'll kill a motherfucka in broad daylight 
Put his head on a platter 
Cuz killin motherfuckas make my day right 
But enough on this real shit, ill shit 
Bound to catch a bad one 
You know what nigga 
I'm tired of talkin to your ass 

[SideKik] 
Shit 
On the low pro 
Slangin trade it 
Check up on my gun and pass 
Eight left in my clip 
Not enough in a drive by 
Make them hollow point tips last 
Say why I'm strugglin like this old young couple 
Slow down young lad 
Put a pause on my pimp on 
Its time to break bread of a nigga 
Had to get what I never had 
My tip now hot as dip dip 
Burn up 
I caught him ready in the ride 
Get out talk crazy 
380, get a sneak peek of my shady side 
Side ride the Best West 
Indo smoke going all in my chest punk 
That's how punks rolled in a plastic bed 

(Chorus) 
Uh Huh 
I pop a Hoester 
Cuz you gone show blood (You right) 
I pop a Hoester 
Cuz you gon show blood (You right) 
I pop a Hoester 
Cuz you gon show blood (You right) 

Uh Huh you right 
Chi Town motherfuckas is too tight 
I pop a Hoester 
Cuz you gon show blood (You right) 
Uh Huh you right 
Chi Town motherfuckas is too tight 

(YungBuk) 
Now I'm on this rap cuz I have to be 
I ain't no motherfuckin actor G 
But a nigga who will pack a 380 
And make you motherfuckas look crazy 
And if you a man put up them Dukes like Daisy 
Know plenty niggas think that they can fuck wit this shit 
Actin hard around they homies 
But alone they get them shit split (Why?) 
Because they don't understand 
If you a bitch, don't be no hoe 
If you a boy , strive to be a man 
Cuz motherfuckas wanna see where yo nuts at 
Motherfuckas bust at me 
You better believe I'm bustin back 
Cuz I ain't no motherfuckin hoe 
Niggas talk hard 
It 's just the perfect size to get traced on the fuckin flo 
So simple as you say it nigga, do the shit 
Cuz niggas wit wounds to this day shoulda knew shit 
You can walk wit the bullshit hoe 
I'm a let you open the doe 
It's goin down bitch 
Slugs from the front row 

[NewSense] 
Let me get this beef up off my chest 
That's weighin my down 
Round for round 
Pound for pound 
Finna grab this tech and clown 
These motherfuckas look for war four hours on the front line 
Slugs flyin, blood shed 
Niggaro's dyin, families cryin 
All because this hoe fucked wit my family 
I don't play that shit 
So rise up the population a bit 
One less, two less, three less bit-ches 
As I gave this trigger quick finger fuckin 
Cuz you shit outta luck 
If you in range 
While I be disenbuckin 
I kill a bystander 
Just for standin by that nigga 
Who fuck wit Psycho Drama 
And made himself a target for this trigger 
Guess I was blinded by the fact 
That this bitch had enough nerve to grab a strap 
And pop a SideKik back 
But he missed 
And I'm pissed 
What he do that shit for 
Now he on his back 
And all the witnesses around the scene of the crime 
Them niggaros too got capped man 
My motto be 
Why go 
If you ain't gon go for broke 
Them niggas best believe that Psycho Dramas all I stand foe 

Chorus 2x </pre>
