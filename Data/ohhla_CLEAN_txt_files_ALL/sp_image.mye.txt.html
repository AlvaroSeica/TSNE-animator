[Chorus: Neenah]
New directions, new ways
New beginnings and new days
Left the path of now to proceed to the road of change
Cause I know that it's all up to me
Starting over, over

[Kam Moye]
Here I am, uh
I think me and y'all should talk
Just sit down and just have a heart to heart
Let me just pour out my thoughts and open up
Though I'm lost at which part to start, I need blessings
Need to make a confession without the Catholic priest present
The brother I see standing here
The man in the mirror had demons hanging over his head like chandeliers
It's hard to backtrack, start a new beginning
So starting today I'm vowing to make a new ending, yeah
They say a new you is hard to rebuild
But keeping some personal flaws are just part of the deal
You could change all your physical features
But beneath are scars, and revealed they are the hardest to heal
So I'ma dream like I live forever
and I'ma live like I'm gon' see my grave tomorrow
I don't care if they doubt me or what they write about me
I proudly smile, cause honestly pal life is God's novel

[Chorus: Neenah] + (Kam Moye)
New directions, new ways
New beginnings and new days
Left the path of now to proceed to the road of change
Cause I know that it's all up to me
Starting over, over
(This is the splitting image of me
 The splitting image of me)

[Kam Moye]
Now I don't wanna be controlled by what my temper's telling me
Don't wanna be tempted by infidelity
Don't wanna have a success fetish so much that I let it edit
who I am inside or feel jealously
I don't wanna be around the friends who steady scheme and plot on you
The moment you down, they ready to kick rocks on you
I need mature friends cause I know that growing old
is mandatory, but you growing up is optional
I'd rather respond than react
I want the wrinkles on my face to symbolise where smiles used to be at
The tough guy persona, I shed it, let it go
I'm Kam Moye head to toe, except it and let me grow
See me as, the smarter rehabilitated version of my past
Be proud of my developments, so fellas toast a glass
At last I learned that happiness is not having what you want
But is wanting what you have (for real)
So I'm good with any success given to me
And I'm cool with being underrated or unsung
Cause my work is undone
The position I'm in is better than that bottom feeder life I come from
So this the part where you either clap for me
or you grab your coat and keys and leave and you don't turn back
Cause from this point I don't care what gets said
Hell, some of y'all need to learn that

[Chorus: Neenah] + (Kam Moye)
New directions, new ways
New beginnings and new days
Left the path of now to proceed to the road of change
Cause I know that it's all up to me
Starting over, over
(This is the splitting image of me
 The splitting image of me)

Hah, Kam Moye

Rock on

{*Excerpt from an interview*}
"Yo that's, that's why a lot of cats don't feel like they
 They really don't get the respect that they deserve sometimes"

Oh yeah I agree, I know exactly what you mean
People judge you unfairly in music and people judge you unfairly in life
It all works the same
If you was that dude who committed some type of crime years ago
That's what people gon' remember you by
And as for myself, I was always seen as that bitter, angry rapper who hated the industry
I mean I still hate the industry, but you know, I'm not mad about it nomore
Hahaha, y'knahmsayin?</pre>
