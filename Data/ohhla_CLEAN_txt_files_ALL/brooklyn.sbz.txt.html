[Shabazz the Disciple]
I'm from the thoroughest borough, and it don't raise no snitches
Son if you ??? buck fifty nigga, face full of stitches
It's BK lil bitches, better tuck in your bling
Ya'll mothafuckas ain't really down to die for your chain
County fo kings, we hook them niggas up to machines
And let it ring, and let you tongue kiss the sweet 16
Every night emergency's flooded, removing the slugs
Every block is Rikers Island, nigga, flooding with Bloods
A run up house party? I ain't tryin to go down there
Ya'll niggas slip up, you get laid down round here
You gettin strip with the niggas you with, tongue kissin the pipe
You'll have a long walk through the projects while I'm makin a ??? knife
I'm from the blocks where the boys'll gas somethin
The handcuff you and whoop your head with the brass knuckles
Shit ya'll better never come across that bridge
Ya'll other fuckin boroughs know what it is, this is Brooklyn nigga

[Hook 1: Shabazz the Disciple]
Don't come out here tryin to hustle all the house parties
You better know the right niggas or you gettin bodied
You on the pissy staircase, tongue kissin the shotti
While my son's in the lobby, there's mad guns in the party

[Chorus: Shabazz the Disciple]
When the party gets rushed and all the niggas turn into a jux
(They blame it on them Brooklyn niggas)
When they shut the shit down cuz it's flooded with crooks
(They blame it on them brooklyn niggas)
And when niggas get show down cuz they wanna be thugs
(They blame it on them Brooklyn niggas)
Who the niggas that make the most noise in the club
(It gotta be the Brooklyn niggas)

[Shabazz the Disciple]
A Brooklyn niggas keep it thuggin from the block to the cell block
Even my fellas got first off, so we bail hop
A hustlas' watch is synchronized with the cops
Hide the stash in the ass or pussy, shake the ??? box
Fighting fam on the cans who stay spitting the ox
Big marshall's in the pen, nigga stay in the box
All they slip is bust clips and Godbodies
Stay in the yard doin pull ups and dips, we hardbody

[Hook 2: Shabazz the Disciple]
We probly rob you in the ghetto, or search you for a ?snake skin?
Niggas on the block with the knife work and the shanks bitch
Niggas in the house party with a shotti on the windshield
Dice hiests, breaks, niggas rob you for the bank ???

[Chorus 2: Shabazz the Disciple]
When niggas riot in the messhall and stab up the Gods
(They blame it on them Brooklyn niggas)
When niggas got locked in for wilding out in the yard
(They blame it on them Brooklyn niggas)
And when niggas do us to infirmary cuz punkie a snitch
(They blame it on the Brooklyn niggas)
Who the niggas that always be takin over this hip-hop shit?
(It gotta be them Brooklyn niggas)

[Shabazz the Disciple]

[Hook 1]

[Chorus 3: Shabazz the Disciple]
When niggas rob the diamond district and get away with the jewels
(They blame it on them Brooklyn niggas)
When niggas get slapped upside the head with the back of the tool
(They blame it on them Brooklyn niggas)
And when the ?? finally rob them and tie up them fools
(They blame it on them Brooklyn niggas)
Who them niggas that's behind all the crime on the news?
(It gotta be them Brooklyn niggas)

[Shabazz the Disciple]
It's the home of Pre Magnetic, Hi-Lo, that nigga Tuck
D-Sec, C Train, you got your eyes closed shut
We on the 3 train, rock away and we'll roll ya
Niggas use them black barrels to stole ya
You got a box with the glocks, sixteen round fights
Yaaa, yaaa, yaaaa, that's all you hear at Crown Heights
Don't ride the A train cuz some Jews on late at night
G C or the F, still ?how we spend the night?
It's BK all day, all day ey day
The pitbulls, the wolves, pirhanas and stingrays nigga, what</pre>
