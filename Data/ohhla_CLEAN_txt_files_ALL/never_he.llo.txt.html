[Intro: J-Beastie (Lounge Lo)]
Yoooooooo (hahahahaahah)
Niggaz never heard of ya (Beasto, what up?)
(You know, back off that Drop City shit)
(You deal me?) Niggaz never heard of ya
So, what it is, man? (You know, that Simpstonian Institute)
(E.S.G., Stone Gang) Niggaz never heard of ya
(We ride yo) I see ridin' (Know I'm sayin')
Niggaz never heard of ya...

[Lounge Lo]
I said I'm couped up, yes in a Coupe truck
The blams on my lap, with my yessa, blowin' purp' in a blue Dutch
And I ain't gotta say no more, y'all niggaz poo puff
Want me to fuck around with dog, ya callin' who's bluff?
I'm off my kindness, no weakness in me
Better believe the beast is in me, I eats the friendly
Jamaica Dave'll let the llama blow
Stab you up twice, come to ya face like "Yo, you got the mama flow"
I do what I do, by the way, my name's Llama Lo
I been through bitches and I fucked all kinda hoes
Staten Island, the mayor, legend and landmark
Most Popular Son, who sit in the sand park
And watch my money rise, I see you funny guys
Walk around lookin' like me, and givin' funny eyes
I never heard of ya, and that's my wordaer
Guess how many niggaz is locked down for murderers

[Chorus: J-Beastie (Lounge Lo)]
(Niggaz never heard of ya) Ya said he did time
Behind the wall, homey, why you first in line?
(Niggaz never heard of ya) He said he real tough
And scream he gettin' money, had to call him out his bluff
(Niggaz never heard of ya) Stop claimin', stop, dog
Ya not that hard, ya not movin' in the yard
(Niggaz never heard of ya) Ya not a murderer
You said you killin' niggaz, but we, we never heard of ya

[J-Beastie]
If so, shall kill me, never break my stride
On 1090, ride on them dudes against the 5
The chronicles of the state, yea, it's still live
I keep my eyes open, look up in the sky
I'm 0-50, never breakin' down on these guys
I'm alive, so everyday's like it's a strive
I sat here and analyze, then watched the fantasize
How these dudes could've sized, how the kid minimized
Couldn't make the sale, he wasn't friend of mine
Get the shit poppin' like the '06 Calimine
He wanna act then dig him a grave
I'ma show him how to rock when he dealin' with brave
You choose ya friends cautious or get split with the blade
Got them runnin' suicide just for the beige
Keepin' niggaz mad cuz they see that I'm paid
I tell 'em suck a dick cuz crime do pay
I do say, if he act, blow off his Kufi
It's you Golden Child, you could as brother Nucci

[Chorus]

[Outro: J-Beastie (Lounge Lo)]
Never heard of you niggaz (Come on Beast)
Haha (That's what they talkin' 'bout)
(You know him? You know him? Who you know? Nah)
How long you know him, nigga? What he about?
You want free lunch with that nigga?
(Come on, you don't even know that dude right here
Fuck claimin' that ya Yessa, man, you know I'm sayin'?)
You know me, nigga? (Staten Island's Most Popular Son, man)
(You know what we do) It's what it is, man
(Yessa Yessa My Lord and Lord My Yessa
Aiyo, Hef, I see you, my nigga) The whole empire
Yo, E.S.G., what's good, homey? (Palm City, the click)
Yeah, what it is, homey, yo Drama, haha! (Yessa)
You movin' real good, man (Bitch, what's the ditz?)
Staten Island (We gettin' 'em, baby, we gettin' 'em, man)
We got 'em (Stoneys!) Yoooooooo... yooooooooooo...
This here's crazy, man, booo... we never heard of ya...
You feelin' good right now, man?</pre>
