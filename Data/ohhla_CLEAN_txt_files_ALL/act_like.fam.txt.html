[Noke D]
Ask any one of these niggaz, who the realest they know
Who put it down on the streets, and in the studio
Who grind everyday, and work as hard as they play
Who making major moves, and not end up in get way hey hey

[D-Reck]
We so many rap dons rap hustlers, and rap kings
With rap things, bragging bout bling-bling
I ain't gon say, that I'm sitting on the throne
Just know, Reck comfortable with the seat he sitting on
So I don't write no mo', just recite these flows
I'ma lead that new so called, Freestyle Pro's
Just give me the riches, give me the bitches
Champagne bad dames, and O's fools on switches

[Double D]
Man I just love when these haters, start spreading they rumors
And let me know whatever I'm doing, should of done it sooner
I ain't fucked up about em, fool I still got em
In my hand like a bird, if you niggaz ain't heard
Yeah I'm back now, reunited how you niggaz gonna act now
I bet you niggaz, wanna come and get a track now
Me and Reck and Noke D, got 'em packed now
You better back down, fool

[Hook: Noke D &amp; (Double D)]
These niggaz tripping acting funny, acting like they don't know
You better respect the name before we, kick in your do'
(If you got it, show it holla if you know it
All my gangstas (hey-hey)
And any nigga who a thug right now
In the club right now, show love right now) (hey-hey)

[Tyte Eyez]
It's time, that my presence be known
It was hard but I thank God, for the blessings he's shown
And the knowledge that he gave me, to maneuver through the hate
So many roaches so many rats, so many fleas so many snakes
In the grass it make me laugh, the way you fags spit your flows
And if brains was dynamite, you niggaz couldn't blow your nose
How the fuck you gon blow up, say man hold up
Y'all niggaz ain't freestyle kings, y'all offspring so grow up

[D-Gotti]
Boys know we put it down, fa real
Got it thoed with the pen, but I hold the steel, ha
And I'm a MC killa, I do it for my niggaz
Double D laced the track, Reck fronted the figgas
Bops scheming let my jokes out, nigga hot now
Wreckshop reloaded, and we bout to drop now
Know I'm saying, you dogs ain't playing this year
I'm out the Penitentiary, trying to leave these suckas in the rear
I fear no man, but God
This my motherfucking job it's my life, for when times get hard
Cause these fraud mo'fuckers, ain't deceiving young nigga
Get your grind on get up out the gutta, and see riches you bitches

[Hook]
