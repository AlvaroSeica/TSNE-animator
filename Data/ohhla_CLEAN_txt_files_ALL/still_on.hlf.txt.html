[Verse 1]
On the late mission for some ass
I had to pull over and get me some gas
And some rubbers and some drank
Let me count my bank, to see if I get some mutha fuckin dank
Oh let me think about with bitch I'm going fuck
A poorless bitch with the willing to suck
My dick grow quick without saying shit
Because I'm the gangsta ass nigga from the dogg pound click
That nigga hd dogg man, my nigga snoop dogg half on the sack
I gots five, so that makes ten
So we got a dime sack, and bide of gin (Well Ight)
And a nigga got drunk as fuck
Now is time for me to go and get my dick sucked
A fine bitch that I meat the other day
Rollin in my six tray down mlk
On the Eastside of the lbag and hch, but hold a wait
Let me elevate my game for this humble
I gives a fuck because I told you so
Ha, Ha

[Chorus (2x)]
Im still on a mission
And I mobbing like a mutha fucka every day
Im Still on a mission
And I'm swerving my tray down mlk

[Verse 2]
Now it all comes back to me
Before I was an og, I was a bg
Way back in eighty threezy
I puttin it down for the eastside of lbc seezy
21st is where we hung that night
A we squabble any nigga that wanted to fight
And if a nigga really wanted to trip
I got a nine with an extra clip on my hip
Get yo ass off the block, before I pop you with my glock
And take your sack of rocks
You I don't gots no love for yo ass
Hurry up nigga move fast
Before I had second thoughts about braking you off
And half dead is straight killing you soft
I be shore, to break you off proper
I beat yo azz down like you were cooper
You know why

[Chorus (2x)]
Im still on a mission
And I mobbing like a mutha fucka every day
Im Still on a mission
And I'm rolling my tray down mlk

[Verse 3]
You better watch yourself, while I'm slagin these rhymes
Im coming with the douser and the funky lines
Real fast, I blast and take yo cash
So hurry up and  move that azz and dash
To the stage, I'm getting page
Like a lonely nigga with a gage, on the front page
Of the papers, you caught the vapors
When you heard I pulled the capers and now I'm making papers
In 1994 fuck a ho, my niggaz on the row tony slow with yo
No nigga try to see me, I'm a bg
Coming from the Eastside of lbc seezy
Im a god damn fool
A young ass bg way back coming from the old school
I don't mean to be this nigga and like I told you before I'm still on a mission

[Chorus (5x)]
Im still on a mission
And I mobbing like a mutha fucka every day
Im Still on a mission
And I'm rolling my tray down mlk</pre>
