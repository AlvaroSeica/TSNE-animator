[Intro: Masta Killa]
Uh, I'mma fuck it like this, hah, uh
Uh, yeah, you already know
Hah, peace to my brother Ghostface
Ahh, yeah, uh, we just hah, yeah, hah

[Masta Killa]
Party people, welcome to the gathering
Many of you tonight have traveled from many miles
To hear the Masta of the art, display styles and techniques
Now with this piece of steel that I hold so firmly
I conduct ya'll accordingly, one time for your mind
Authentic redesigned and crafted by the hand of God
Autograph camera phones, flash as I enter
A glimpse from the ninja, rarely seen and heard
But his word so powerful, catch him at the show and prove
Building with Allah Sun

[Chorus: Masta Killa]
Who they talking bout me? I?
They talking bout, who they talking bout? I? I?
Who ya'll talking bout? Huh?
Who they talking bout? Me? Huh?
Who they talking bout? You keep my mic in your mouth, huh

[Masta Killa]
With beats so banging and bass drum kicking in
Melody soulful streams are calling
It's like back against electrical fence, but I'm a winner
My mic's like my only defense, brothers locked down
Aunties they changed my Pampers, all sponsors
I won't fail the mission, with self knowledge guiding me
Never could contain me, from seeing everything that's mine
Economically, nothing is given
We know steps are taken, people couldn't seen it
Til they burst into existence
Burst the star guns from the sleeves of my jacket

[Chorus]

[Masta Killa]
See this is how your rhyme gotta be, young G
I'm a writer, not a rapper, MC build or destroyer
Some over stand, but I understand that
We are suitors to life, true divine order
Must be restored in order for us to live right
Ya'll stay chirping like birds, words travel
At the speed that I'm slapping you, axle as the world revolves
Caliente, it's about a hundred degrees with no breeze
Can you swim nine thousand?
I bench press hills and mountains from the highest peak
I fears no evil as I walk through the valley
I'm like the father at the first rally, are you listening?</pre>
