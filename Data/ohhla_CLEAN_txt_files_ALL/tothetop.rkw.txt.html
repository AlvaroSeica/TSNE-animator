[Intro: Maino]
Ha Ha Ha! Unstoppable! Come on man! Mafia! MAINO!!!

[Verse One: Maino]
Let's take it to the top like a escalator
What! To touch me you need a elevator
Black Mob my team strong my style greater
Smooth criminal white linen on yellow gators 
Started with a dream to make it to a key
Now we hoppin out of cars that never use a key
Came up hard off credit cards and local schemes
Now it's women who make a livin right on their knees
All them nights, pray that night, for better days
Feelin like, Biggie in them versace shades
Vegas lights, sparkles bright, we on a wave
Feelin right, bitches nice, I can't behave
Chillin down Miami with my cuban piece
She won't let me leave grabbin on my cuban link
Pop models, pop mollies in large dose
Pack light pack hammers at them awards shows

[Interlude: Maino] (Raekwon)
YEAH! YEAH! (Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Whattup lord!)
MAFIA!!!!

[Verse Two: Raekwon]
Smokescreen coolin in them boats sellin choke
Jump out the whole world know this I'm only rich floatin 
Real deal bentley niggas, feel them heaters
We them Beatles pull out on family members snake elitist
Quart a million shit on the stove
Got some real Brooklyn killa Staten niggas with me spit on your globe
Got my lawyer in the back at the foyer, eatin saut√©ed fish
Pass the goya my gun named Toya
Marble floors in the benz the rims is regular
Come through new lots tag 'em in
A don with his sword and his leather and I've been on the walls in Ossining 
And bring it back through Bed-Stuy my clever kin
With me yo King with me reload quickly
I'm shellin down fifty a cheba, eloquently
I relax in the Waldorf, under the covers 
In the sawed-off sweatin this shit, growin a mohawk
Ready to blow off.....I hear the door dog

[Outro: Raekwon]
One million two million three million franks, all that, it's that good shit eloquently
Yeah! The marvelous, millicent, Maino in the buildin
Louis Rich the chopper, yeah  </pre>
