[Intro/Chorus: Big K.R.I.T.]
Refrain from bein lame, say it like you mean it 
Get up off yo' feet like it's the first time you've seen it
Music is my, bitch, let nothin come between us 
Cain't no one do it better, hoe 
It's the Return of 4Eva, 4Eva-eva, 4Eva-eva 
It's the Return of 4Eva, 4Eva-eva, 4Eva-eva 
It's the Return of 4Eva, 4Eva-eva, 4Eva-eva 
It's the Return of 4Eva, 4Eva-eva, 4Eva-eva 
 
[Big K.R.I.T.]
They holl'n,"BOUT - TIIIIME," that's what they told me
You want this money, don't be scared, hoe show me 
Old - school, I'm pushin hella flats 
I'm workin wheels, crackin seals, breakin pro's backs
Never - change, I cain't be Hollywood
I'm way to country, plus I'm bumpin in my neighborhood 
Fifth - wheel, +Comin' Out Hard+ 
'cause all I wanted was some rims on the candy car 
Third - coast, now what'cha know about it? 
I keep it trill, never slippin, you should never doubt it 
PEEIMP - TIGHT~! Picture perfect frame
Never trickin on these dames, refrain from bein lame
 
[Chorus]
 
[Big K.R.I.T.]
They holl'n, "HOL' - UP," but I cain't slow it down 
Too much to prove, if it ain't money I cain't come around 
Mul--ti, that's what I'm known fo' 
I'm never comfy, came from nothin bitch I want mo'
Don't - play, you know the sco' f'real 
I kept it country, and I'll be country even wit a deal 
Still - fly, cain't keep a player down 
Mainstream is cool, but in my heart, forever underground 
Thank - God, make due with what I have 
I grew up po', fuck what you heard, I ain't goin back 
R-4, I'm lettin my nuts hang 
Never trickin on these dames, refrain from bein lame
 
[Chorus]

("Now remember, now you've got to go out there 
 and you gotta work like NOBODY'S ever worked before... can you dig it?")</pre>
