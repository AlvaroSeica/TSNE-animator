Yea, yea...
My life is deep, everyday's like constant greif
And all I wanna do is breathe, so I choose to rely on me
I'll never let me..

My life is deep, everyday's like constant greif
And all I wanna do is breathe, so I choose to rely on me
I'll never let me down..down, down, down, down
I'll never let me down
So I choose to rely on me, I'll never let me..

My life is deep, everyday's like constant greif
And all I wanna do is breathe, so I choose to rely on me, yea

Look, I spit the truth in the booth, no lie
so believe when I say that I've cried some nights
All on my own in my room and I'm thinking
why did I choose this life it's deep
where did it all go wrong, please tell me
I remember, and it feels like just the other day when my life was peaceful
Sitting on a wall in Stroudy
Now a few years later, I'm a little bit older, wised up, that much stronger
My mum thinks that I'm wasting time, I'm folding man, I cant handle the pressure
And I've been a star from school, so I've gotta maintain the cool
If not then I get labeled a wasteman, somebody help me son I'm gunna fall
Its a normal ting I find myself in the mixup
And its all 'cause I touch mic's, all 'cause they call me Stryde or Stryder
All 'cause I came up with Ruffsquad, Rascal and Tiger
If I roll to a next endz, I'm bound to run into a next breh
'Cause I'm hype hype this year, but they aint gunna move me
Not while I'm here, not this year
I'm not letting them take the piss here, I'm tryin to blow like Wretch here
But man are still tryin to hold me back like wait there
Man get busy like roach on a biscuit
Look, all this hype 'cause I MC and all I wanna do is make mad p
Look, is this really worth it, this life is far from perfect
Pain inside, but I'm cool on the surface, 'cause the click aint tight no more
Some friends cant look me in the eye no more
Its hurting but I dont cry no more
I put my boy on my mix cd and all he could say is "My name aint on it"
Rar, thats the thanks I get, mind and next time we'll see who's on it
Even my boys think I'm mashing with p's so I'm not even shocked by the war on the streets
And they think that Stryder's nice and the jack move goons keep plotting on me
Little did they know that my dough aint there yet
I'm nice with the flow but I'm not quite there yet
That's why I'm a +Star In The Hood+ 'cause they think I've burst when I aint even blown yet
Aint it aint even ending there these random questions I'm facing bare
Like "Why didn't Rascal sign you? Why not Ruffsquad, Why Newham Generals?"
I'm like, "Business is business, plus he dont owe me nuttin"
All these questions, I aint got answers, what do I look like his brain or something?
Stop asking if its all cool, 'cause all I can do is speak from my side
And its still all love round East side, most of the mandem are still on your side
It was only a few years back, they had the strongest team its a fact
Now look I've done my first album, no features from Rascal or Wiley, it's fucked..

Yea, its real talk man, realness man, like..
I had to say what I had to say man..
Get me man, it's all love, still..
Yea, I'm signing out, I'm out, I'm out, I'm out, I'm out..


Yea, yea..
My life is deep, everyday's like constant greif
And all I wanna do is breathe, so I choose to rely on me
I'll never let me..

My life is deep, everyday's like constant greif
And all I wanna do is breathe, so I choose to rely on me
I'll never let me down..down, down, down, down
I'll never let me down
So I choose to rely on me, I'll never let me..

My life is deep, everyday's like constant greif
And all I wanna do is breathe, so I choose to rely on me
I'll never let me down
I'll never let me down
I'll never let me down</pre>
