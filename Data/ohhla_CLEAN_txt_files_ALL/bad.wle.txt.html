[Intro: Wale]
Monogamy or whatever you call it, I'm starting to think it ain't for everybody
Most of us rushing into it anyways, you know what I'm saying
You ain't rushing for love, and I ain't up here to judge
Let's neglect the what if's and make it do what it does
Let's get it...

[Chorus: Tiara Thomas]
Is it baaaad that, I never made love?
No I never did it, but I sure know how to fuck
I'll be your, baaaad girl, I'll prove it to you
I can't promise that I'll be good to you
cause I ha-aad some issues, I won't commit
No, not having it, but at least I can admit 
that I'll be bad noooooo to you (to you)
Yeah, I'll be good in bed but I'll be bad to you

[Interlude: Tiara Thomas]
Baaaad that, I never made love
No I never did it, but I sure know how to fuck

[Wale] + (Tiara Thomas)
Lets get it..
Bad girls ain't no good, and the good girls ain't no fun
And the hood girls want a smart NIGGA, college girls all want a thug
So it seems we fiend what we don't need, got a thing for a queen who know when to leave
I ain't bout to judge you, don't judge me, you ain't gotta really sing about your rap sheet
Cause I heard you (bad nooo to you) yeah, in the literal sense I mean that
Rough sex saying I love ya but to kiss them is saying you mean that (bad nooo to you)
I know I just be calling her mean ass
Oh the irony, got the bomb indeed but the problem is it's probably a deep past
Still I'm feeling of something I need bad, thinking if I get her, I get her to need this
I don't need emotions to open your deep sea, I conceive an ocean by going between legs
Beg, nope, bed, floor, dope, go, for it, couch, now
Slow, mo-tion, around, put it down; Lord knows she was goin' for the morn, hold up

[Chorus]

[Wale] + (Tiara Thomas)
Yeah, lemme tell you about, look..
She hurt feelings, she break hearts, she stay quiet, she play smart
She take pride, in going out, getting hollered at, and saying nah
She no saint, but she don't pose, she don't wear make up by the boat load
Riding through lake shore with the nose up, she don't really date much but it slows her up
She got haters, but we all do, heard your winter time cold shawty fall through
Baby look at they approach, how they court you: all those minds games nevermind cause they all lose
(Bad nooo) In the physical sense I mean that
I ain't tryna kiss up, suck up, feed gas, I ain't like them nigga you sucking your teeth at, nope
(Bad nooo) Play big, trust me I'll humble your mean ass, look
Shawty is actually in prevent cause the one in front is working deep threat, yep
Bed, floor, couch, more, more, shower, Lord, perm
Done, love, nah; called in the morning cell number wasn't on, goddamn

[Chorus] + [Interlude]</pre>
