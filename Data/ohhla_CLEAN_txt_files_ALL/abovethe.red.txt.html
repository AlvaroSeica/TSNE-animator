[Intro]
{*HBO TV logo sound*}
{*airplane engines rumble*}
Ladies and gentlemen
Captain Al Thompson has turned off the no smoking sign
And you are free to smoke at this time
Please refrain from smoking in the aisles, the lavatories
and the non-smoking areas of this cabin

[Jeffrey Osborne "All Because of You" samples]
I was sitting up above the clouds
Then one day you just came soaring by
Then my life just took a sudden turn
It's hard to swallow but you live and learn
I was sitting up above the clouds
Then one day you just came soaring by

[Red Cafe]
Yeah, let me breathe on it
Light it up 'til we hit the roof
'Til that coconut Circo got 'em gettin loose
We above 'em all, now they wan' call a truce
But I'm quarterbackin, busy callin audibles
Cruisin through the finish line
I'm still eatin dinner baby I ain't finished mine
E'rybody want the throne, y'all get in line
I'm comfortable, I got a dime and I got a nine
Whassup? I'm sittin way above the clouds
Like I'm on the stage, and I'm above the crowd
Preach capital game in the microphone
Fin' to tell these halfway crooks leave the mic alone
Nigguh~! Y'all killin the feeling
Got a nigga ready to go back, killin and dealin
Meanwhile I'm still lettin the kush burn

[Jeffrey Osborne samples]
Then my life just took a sudden turn
It's hard to swallow but you live and learn
I was sitting up above the clouds
Then one day you just came soaring by

[Red Cafe - over samples at first]
And I've been doin this for a long time
My grind strong
Puttin that work in, as you should
So while I'm sittin on this cloud lighting up
Breathe, bitch~!

Everybody judgin me - I guess it's a contest
Yeah, and I see the victory right in front of me
I turn back and trip 'em with no conscience
I know, no class, no sportsmanship
With that attitude I see no fortune, shit
But ask me if I give a fuck
I'm still winnin and they callin it beginner's luck
Ridin around in a bulletproof tinted truck
I know they got love but shit, they might hit it up
Yeah, just to get a name, just to get the fame
But all the hoes screamin they just wanna get Jermaine
They know I got it and I spent it
I get money every day, ain't none of this rented
I gotta get it, gotta finish the herb...

[Jeffrey Osborne samples]
Then my life just took a sudden turn
It's hard to swallow but you live and learn
I was sitting up above the clouds
Then one day you just came soaring by

[Red Cafe - over samples]
I mean I feel like we on a victory lap
Celebration is definitely in order
All my G's light up
Ladies I'ma pop these bottles and um

[Outro]
We gon' drink away the pain, believe that
I mean it's a beautiful day, huh?
We above the clouds
I'm lookin down on more than a nigga girl, ha ha
Ahhh, yeah don't mind me
I just got, I just got that grease nigga
Nigga taught me that grease, believe that
Like I was sayin this a celebration
Ladies and gentlemen, niggaz and bitches
Pimps and hoes, we gon' get right to it
This is Red Cafe, reportin to you live
