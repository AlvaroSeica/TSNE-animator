[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
Baby, I wanna.. I wanna get you to understand
I love you.. and I love her too
..But that may be too much for you to deal with
so I wrote a song about it, you wanna hear it?
Well, here it go

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
My life is Mardi Gras and she's the life of the party, y'all
It's like "Ring Around the Rosie", when I came around they chose me
And I make 'em feel famous, famous, FAMOUS, famous
Winner's circle, the square don't fit
And I'm caught up in a triangle ship, now
Livin life in a triangle ship, now now
And I'm caught up in a triangle ship, now
Livin life in a triangle ship, now now
And I'm caught up in a triangle ship, now

[Terrace Martin]
Yeah, I'm caught up in the middle of this love thang
I keep tryin to escape the ball and chain
My main dame holds me down for the winner season
My side piece just a winner, that's for many reasons
Insecurities inside of myself
have me not be able to picture you with nobody else, heh
I'm caught up between two beautiful women
who both cook, clean, and play they position
It's like, I know I'm wrong but I, can't seem to get it right
Process of elimination, hell of a decision to make
Take two (take two) and add me
Never knew a real commitment would ever involve three
The one, she got a temper, always make sure I'm fed
The other one, she leaves me lonely cause she's focused on the bread
Yeah, can't a man ever be so lucky
I guess that's why these women don't trust me, a 3ChordFold

[Chorus]

[Terrace Martin]
It's hard bein a star of a plot when
(Livin life) Love and lust at the same time, goddamn
So I doubled up, put five on they gotten
Gambled with they hearts, had the ball and I dropped it
To leave'll be the death of me, dearly departed
Don't know how I got by bein partially honest
A thin line between love and hate, yeah I crossed it
Wait~! Love is no guarantee, I got options
Fate, is me and her (me and her), it's me and she (me and she)
Multiple choices, not A and B
A test I was destined to fail fo' sho, boy
Rather be stingy than see you huggin on ol' boy
Oh boy, I'm just a man, with a lotta love to give
And I hope you understand, it was never my intent
to mislead me to of you, but it is what it is
Cupid tried to aim straight but I guess Cupid missed - 3ChordFold
