Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Cincinnati red hat, all I do is bowl out
Pop fly if you wanna fuck around get drugs out
Cash money young money who fuck it with us
All the other younger's I'm the motha fucking illest
Ohio with me. but town in this bitch pockets hella deep
Fuck around and drowning his bitch
I only care for my daughter
So I grind even harder Star in my own movies and I'm not Martin Lawrence
I'm sitting on these niggaz these boys ain't in my lane
Body on competition I don't cross on my slamp
Hot socks and some vans
Telling my ain't plan
And my pig bank fine, I'mma bout to go HAM niggaz
Still hating on me like I even really care
Got your girl in my whip she get me brain while I stare
I'm the hottest do doing it, don't let em tell you otherwise
Rap games garbage all these nigga do is lie

[Chorus]
I got em yeah
I got em yeah
Let em niggaz know I'm the motherfuckin problem
Hey I got em yeah
I got em yeah
Let em niggaz know I'm the motherfuckin problem

Chrome on the truck like a hore you suck
Not Missy Elliott but tell em niggaz past the Dutch
Drizzy put me on some hoes from the T dot
Y M C M B yeah nigga we hot
Only rock Jordans nigga fuck Reebok
You nigga tell mess up, like a broken down wrist watch
Real niggaz do real nigga shit
Keep my bussiness till my son n' hoes and talkin' about you quick
Rico turn that 5 D, on what you got me smokin' on damn, dog that weed strong
Really tho, they ain't fucking with the kid
They don't get it how I get it and live it how I live
What it is

[Chorus]
I got em yeah
I got em yeah
Let em niggaz know I'm the motherfuckin problem
Hey I got em yeah
I got em yeah
Let em niggaz know I'm the motherfuckin problem</pre>
