[Gangsta Pat]
Now normally, I'm not wit dat dissin shit
callin no nigga name on no muthafuckin record
but now if a nigga get off in a magazine
and they want to say something negative about you
then that leaves you no muthafuckin choice
but to tear into they ass
so three-six bitches, this for ya'll baby
  
(Chorus x8)
Tear my club up, Im gone tear yo club down
  
[Gangsta Pat]
Whats it with these three-six bitches runnin they mouth
I thought it was supposed to be love up in the south
callin Murder Dog magazine callin my name
Tryin to dis a real muthafucka just to get fame
I see you all in the source tryin to claim like you hard
Niggas from your own hood steal pullin your cars
push em off  nigga please you dont come in the club
I aint never see you in the hood showin no love
See I'm above all this dissin shit
but ya had to piss me off so just listen bitch
let me tell you bout this south I'm bad for your health
these violations from you hoes I just can't accept
You talk the talk now walk the walk you suckas cant see me
grew up bumpin off my shit now you want to be me
I catch my name in yo mouth again you gettin clowned
FUCK TEAR DA CLUB UP, IM GONE TEAR IT DOWN, BITCH
  
(chorus repeat x8)
  
[Gangsta Pat]
I even showed you bitches love back on Deadly Verses
now I'm tryin to patch yo names on six livin hearses
Voodoo curses haunt your soul when you see my face
off the muthafuckin map is you I must erase
Come and get a taste of what it feels like to get some fame
and have a lot of bitch niggas callin yo name
If you suckas want drama you know where I be at
come on fool and get some, I'm gone be waitin black
Bring your boys Juicy J and Lord Infamous
I got a group full of killas and they anxious to bust
See you suckas think I'm playin I done had enough
Its time to designate yo ass like I'm showed up
You should have never crossed that line that was on yo mind
Now you got to deal wit me on my fuckin time
You know revenge is like the sweetest joy next to gettin pussy
I wish one of you coward ass niggas would come and push me, BITCH
  
(chorus repeat x8)
  
[Gangsta Pat]
Represent, you aint representin shit
You represent some niggas that blew up off of BONE dis
claimin that they stole your style bitch you never had one
I heard your recent Cd its wacker than the last one
Im ready to blast one of you trick bitches
dropin of the south tryin to tamper wit my riches
See your click is paper thin aint no hard in your group
Prophet Posse is a army full of coward ass troops
Your records sales comes from dissin bone thugs click
now I'm seeing Krazie Bone rappin on yo shit
You niggas wish to god you had a real fuckin posse
Im talkin bad about you and you bitches can't stop me
 and if you violate, I'm gone treat you like a hoe in jail
ass open, wig split, and can't receive no mail
Three six better watch they muthafuckin back
for that crazy ass nigga named GANGSTA PAT, BITCH
