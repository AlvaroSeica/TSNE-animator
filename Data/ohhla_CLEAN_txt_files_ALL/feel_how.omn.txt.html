I feel how I feel, I'm real like I'm real
tension in my shoulder cause a nigga feelin older
cold cuts for dinner, not a winner now its obvious
I'm probably just better off, quit spittin'
I feel how I feel, I'm real like I'm real
tension in my shoulder cause a nigga feelin older
cold cuts for dinner, not a winner now its obvious
I'm probably just better off, quit spittin'

something magical had to happen, we got to rapping
the dj started scratching, behind his back we started clapping
man in the middle, stand and deliver, this is one to remember
from city to city, we getting busy digging the scene, check it
a brand new record, only gets better from here
something new to bump for the new year
got good where I once stood, now I see clear
and it feels good to live life with ought no fear, yeah
we can take it there if you pay your fare, oh yeah
if you make it there you can taste the air
just another piece of my collection
look we're all connected, from all directions
I play my part and spread the message

I feel how I feel, I'm real like I'm real
tension in my shoulder cause a nigga feelin older
cold cuts for dinner, not a winner now its obvious
I'm probably just better off, quit spittin'
I feel how I feel, I'm real like I'm real
tension in my shoulder cause a nigga feelin older
cold cuts for dinner, not a winner now its obvious
I'm probably just better off, quit spittin'

political, incorrect, with no intellect
folks don't know the hole scenario
brain washed, got diluted, you and I included
why the true living god got executed
privacies intruded, overseas invasion to get that new shit
mad abrasion, on that rude shit while folks still pledge allegian' with that bullshit
rally up the folks, tally up the vote
hieroglyphics on a hundred dolla' c- note
to get specific we in the boat with no paddle, up shit creek, many get sent to battle

I feel how I feel, I'm real like I'm real
tension in my shoulder cause a nigga feelin older
cold cuts for dinner, not a winner now its obvious
I'm probably just better off, quit spittin'
I feel how I feel, I'm real like I'm real
tension in my shoulder cause a nigga feelin older
cold cuts for dinner, not a winner now its obvious
I'm probably just better off, quit spittin'</pre>
