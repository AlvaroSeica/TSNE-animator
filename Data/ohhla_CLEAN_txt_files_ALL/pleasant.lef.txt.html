Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

Hachin up ill shit man
Ohh shit, whew!
Yo - what are you doin later?
I'm just chillin, whatever

[Jake Lefco]
I just got pleasant, I'm chillin in my sweatpants
Listening to Redman, high tonight
Crank the volume up that's all I want, all at once
Let it bump 'til the day's done, feel the bass thump
Jumped in the shower, hot water falls fast
Quick to make my back muscles relax
Brush my teeth clean, put my Degree on
Boxers, socks jean, t-shirt and fleece on
On my phone says Drew, Happ G and Big E called
It's gonna have to wait, gotta get a bite to eat y'all
Hopped in the black Mag, shifted up to wah wah
Order from the deli belly lifted from the lah lah
Slid past the Fritos, Sun Chips and Cheetos
So much junk I thought I'd never find Nemo
Probably woulda starved if it wasn't for my heroes
Turkey classic, Arizona and Doritos

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Yo I'm in no hurry, no worries, no stressin
No question, it's Friday night, let's get pleasant
I'm gettin pleasant, you gettin pleasant? (Lef Lef)
Who gettin pleasant, we gettin pleasant

[Jake Lefco]
I'm so pleasant, we just found a spot by the bar
And parallel parked with a spark
Barkin with my dawgs, talkin that hilarious talk
Carryin on, rhymin with the Clarion on
I roll into the spot singin various songs
Show the bouncer ID, and cover the charge
I open the door, and float in the room
I was greeted by the jukebox shakin my shoes
It's heatin up my tube socks, gimme two shots
And watch the Grey Goose flock to the rooftop
Surrounded by booty, cuties in tube tops
And dudes on stools impersonatin Tupac
With cigarette smog leavin eyeballs punished
Need a water for my throat, and a beer for my stomach
I was shocked when the bartender asked what I wanted
I said "HELL YEAH~!" I thought she asked if I'm blunted

[Chorus]

[Jake Lefco]
I stumbled out of the bar, pleasant as hell
Squinted at the street lamp, tried to steady myself
Left my car on the block, started wavin at cabs
With no cash, wavin 'em past, I'm lookin for Happ's
It's crowded out front, players lookin for ass
And one too many drunks trashed, lookin to scrap
Then I saw my man Drew, turned the corner and laughed
"Yo, I got 5 in the whip, but you can squish in the back"
Hmm - maybe I could fit on the dash
Then a faw jawn grabbed me, "You can sit on my lap!"
I can't lie it was comfy, soft and lumpy
I never woulda known the ride home was bumpy
Dumped me at the house, from the kitchen to the couch
Busy stuffin leftover chicken in my mouth
Sittin flippin channels, driftin in and out
Isn't this pleasant? {*snore*}

[Chorus]

{*scratched to end: "The greeny green is all I want now"*}</pre>
