[Intro: Li-Mouse]
Yeah, you know, it's just that time
Where everything's gotta come to that end
So we can send, word...
It's just, you know, I had mad fun
It's been a good time
But yo, but yo, but yo

[Li-Mouse]
Season One; the ending credits
We run through programs with, little edits
A project, that lasted four years
Finally done, but I'mma hold back my tears
Cause I know, they'll be another
Rip more tracks with my hip hop brother
Yeah, Order Rodentia we out of here
Give a rest, to your brain and ears
Give it up, put your hands together
The Rodentz, you know we gonna last forever
All you haters, we sever
Your head from your shoulder in rainy weather
Aiyo, I'mma see you, next season
Get the album, you need no reason (no reason)
My final word, take it easy (take it easy)
Live life to the fullest and make sure you ain't sleezy kid (yo, but yo, but yo)

[Cno Evil]
No more intruding, no more confusion
This is the conclusion, the Season Finale
The Rodentz, no, it's not an illusion
We gettin' play now from New York to Cali
Don't stand close to the ledge, if you don't know
Cuz now, we more 'serious' than satellite radio
Cno, wherever he appears, chaos follows
While your tired empty flows, leave you sleepy and hollow
All this contribution, make you feel right
Countless working nights, tweek this til it's tight
Leave it in the dark and drop a little light
Perepheals don't work for us, we out of your sight
This moment shines, I take my curtain call
Five foot five, I stand taller than all of ya'll
Unique achieveness with the Emmy nominations
We win the award, receiving the standing ovations</pre>
