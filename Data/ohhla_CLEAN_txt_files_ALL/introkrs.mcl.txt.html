[KRS-One]
Yo whattup? It's the Blastmaster KRS-One
and I'm chillin in BROOK-LYYYYYYN!!
Now we come down right now to let you know
that MC Lyte is NOT to be fucked with
This album will bring nothing
but the lyrical terrorism and hardcore beats
So come down MC Lyte
because you alone run the dancehall borderline!</pre>
