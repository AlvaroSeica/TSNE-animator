Hook 2x:

C-H-I-C-A-G-O
It's the final tic and here we go
Forget about them other styles
Conflict kicking rodeo

Verse 1: Kilo

Once upon a time
In the land of gang bang mentality
When we drop quick
Final tic clik
Fatality is reality
When the sunset
We blaze this hay
In the midst of a Conflict that's Crucial
Here we become bogus on the hunt
Notice how we speak this bump
If you wondering what is rodeo
THEN SADDLE UP!
For a different adventure
A journey to Chicago
Westside where the hood lie
'95 bound, we talking bout shit
Of a different plane
Secret loan hear we bang
The rooting tooting shooting maniac
Banging gats blunted high
The gat going up tonight giddy up
We copping that game at the drop of a dime
Cause really where I'm at
Scandalous, peeping the foes
You gotta know the signs
Load 'em up fast time running out
Turn 'em in turn 'em round
For the Conflict
If youz a snitch you betta get a grip
And come equipped for the Final Tic

Hook

Verse 2: Cold Hard

You know again it's on in the motherfucker
Still riding, my style is based on rodeo
Crucial Conflict what they hollering
They spooky now nigga let's turn it on
Fuck it burn shit
Let's fight till we hear that final tic
Kill till we kill each other clik
Bitch, you was talking crazy
But now we finish up your damn mouth
Send your bitch ass back down south
Let you know that your ass out
Niggas playing these games like a lame
Get they ass whipped
Beat up and slapped around
Broken legs twisted hips
Two eyes shot two busted lips
Teeth knocked out two busted whips
Bloody body up for gives
That's the life you chose to live
Now what's up wid that tough shit
I knew your ass was just a bitch
Drop you down just like a bomb
And you got the Final Tic

Hook 2x

Verse 3: Never

Nigga this the final tic
Calm bitches done made him mad
Bust a cap and jump back and it's on
And I'm gone and got a damn thing to say
Push push and push one more motherfuckin' time
Fuck a bitch fighting ain't the same no more
So I got the stinking hoe
Push that bitch 6 under zero
Who to roll mile though for Chicago
Kicking down the door wid the rodeo
C-O-N-flict trigger happy got the bomb
Up in the barnyard
Smoking on hay everyday in the Chi-Town
Had you throw down wid rodeo fever
And we got our mind made up
Give a fuck what the next man say gotta make it
Let me get down and take it
To that other level, petty ride
Who doing the killing
Presuming to killing the villain
I'ma meet you on that other side
Born to kill a man gotta kill a man
Born to ride and ride and roll in thick
I'ma come on up so you betta get ready
For the last and Final Tic

Hook

Verse 4: WildStyle

This is the final tic
I didn't mean to show my ass hoe
But I can't be soft coming off nasty
Willing woulda killa nigga if you wanna
Make it out alive kid you might die
I could fuck up your homies
Everylast one a y'all is a free fall ah no
Dynamite all around me
In ten more seconds we all might be gone
Four tons a death
You can't escape the Conflict
Wid the rodeo when you explode
It's overloading the flow
If you know woulda known
Betta pray cause it won't be no more
Did you wanna be blindfolded
Pressure, all around make you feel it
I'ma villain I'ma kill it
Final tic tock quick
In the room and smoke it
Close you eyes and hold on tight
Don't try to fight it's on tonight
Bet a motherfucker now won't touch that mic
Cause he might get this dynamite
Grabbed your face trying to get away
Conflict done dropped the bomb bitch
Straight from C-H-I, we never die
You know I talk that final tic
