[Intro]
Yo!
My lil bruh Wiz just uh
Poured me some champagne, appreciate that bruh
I first pissed some real shit man, you know what I'm sayin so uh, you know
We trippy
Getting fucked up
You know what I'm sayin?

[Bridge 1: x2]
Roll em up, pop em up
Roll em up, pop em up
Roll em up, pop em up
That the bidness, get the bidness up

[Interlude]
Trippy niggas
Real shit, real shit, let's get it

[Verse 1]
Scared young nigga let me put you on to the game
Fuck do you think they know? Make sure ain't nothing lame
No trickin a nigga, don't trip at a nigga
A nigga might come back and bust all you niggas
And these hoes shy, make sure you get the prize
Before you roll the dice
Ratchet ass hoes
Pocket full of money, know a lil something
Life getting silly, you get mo fo a bundle
Take it from me pimpin, me I'm like forgive it
The way I hear we don't consider that lyrics
Fuck that bitch, mistreat that bitch
Say it again, say that shit again
If they start killin give em the barrel end
Give your all again, and this will never end
It's the different kind but have me for a man and a pimp
Our beach half full of these niggas getting sick

[Bridge 2]
I'm so turnt up I won't turn down

[Chorus: x2]
Not that Charlie Brudges so don't play with me
Guns like roommates, they stay with me
Plenty goons and they gon spray with me
Nigga I'm 1000, I'm a stay a G

[Verse 2]
Nigga pick the wrong day for they fuck shit
He mustn't heard I'm bout that fuck shit
Baby choppa, fresh out the bars nigga
You was hard then now you actin box nigga
I'm on the beam, I wanna pop a nigga
I blink my eyes, my youngin shot the nigga
Ballin on these haters, I don't need a GM
Shootin shootin at yo ass, like do a rim
Put yo ass up like you took a swim
Choppa chop em down, call him a lim
Trippy ass niggas turnt up OG
Killers finding where you live then they going in
Run up in yo shit, take yo presidents
Give everybody no evidence
North niggas, we don't talk, we a mug a bitch
44 killa Â– David Berkowitz

[Bridge 2]
I'm so turnt up I won't turn down

[Chorus: x2]
Not that Charlie Brudges so don't play with me
Guns like roommates, they stay with me
Plenty goons and they gon spray with me
Nigga I'm 1000, I'm a stay a G

[Bridge 2]
I'm so turnt up I won't turn down

I'm a stay a G
I'm a stay a G
I'm a stay a G...
I'm a stay a G...</pre>
