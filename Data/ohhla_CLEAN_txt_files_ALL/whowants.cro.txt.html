Verse I (Eastwood)

Now do my niggaz wanna fuck tonight? Hell yeah
How many Ladies wanna fuck tonight? We do, we do

Ey yo, I once had a bitch named Chilly
And she wouldn't do it my way
So I slapped the bitch silly
That 64 Chevy hopin' blowin' on trees
With nasty Nicole Young blowin' on any tease
So you bitches didn't expect that Tha Row is back
But with a twist in youth authority my hoes come back, now how I act off the cognac
Lay 'em down flat beat the dick to the cat, you top notch hood rat
I love bitches in fourth quarter fuck 'em in clutch
Got your baby mama fiendin' for dick, she wanna fuck now
Don't be mad if I bless you and hit her and
Don't be mad cause I like 'em fly in short skirts
And my money you'll never get it with the stick
I'm sick with it, I made her cum quick with it
When the young Wood hit it like different
Yeah I'll be strokin' and leavin' the Pussy open
When I'm in it, it ain't no joke and get your whole back broke

Now do my niggaz wanna fuck tonight? Hell yeah
How many Ladies wanna fuck tonight? We do, we do

Verse II (Danny Boy)

She gave me head in the Benz and then we had sex in the Lex
And we pop a lot 7-11, while we was bangin' them new Row hits
She said she know it's about to happen
Just like in '94, '95, 96
I keep it real, I stick to the script girl
I gotta get my riches, money over bitches

Verse III (Crooked I)

I grab my dick and say girl, I'm just an artist after cheddar
But when you strip I'm the hardest rapper ever
I'm tellin' hoes ain't no holy matrimony
Just us, fuckin' on the holy mattress only
Now go in as your homie if they down with a ménage
Cause I'm down to get massage
Fuck the iconologe; beat it down in a garage, ugh
Nobody's hittin' these hoes harder
I could piss off a bridge and still feel the cold water
I been a fiend since Billy Jean
I'm in a clean limousine
Givin' this bitch from the Philippines that Jimmy Dean sausage
Watch me fuck till I'm exhausted
All of my real bitches only be fuckin' with Bosses
When we sex a freak in extra sheets I'm with it
Give me head for weeks, I'll spread your cheeks and hit it
I bet you reach your sexual peak in minutes
If your legs can reach your neck, I'm deep up in it
Damage your corn rolls, god damn it
Let's grab a camera, get the cam in and make amateur pornos
I'm slammin' the door close, you got me very bent
Crook's a pussy banger that eastside limp dick

Now do my niggaz wanna fuck tonight? Hell yeah
How many Ladies wanna fuck tonight? We do, we do

Verse IV (Ja Rule)

Baby I don't regret shit, what time is it to live reckless
Pushin' the six at times I get my dick licked
I'm childish, one of a kind, one in my own
And I'm about to take you freak hoes the devils a no
And touch your lips, and better off fuck the lips
The more positions the better
I been here for whatever see, feel me
I don't need weed to get high
Some good head will make a nigga kiss the sky
No lie, cause if she ain't right, turn the lights off
Put her on a summit and pump till your dicks' soft
The Rule does it, street love, how I met cha
Down to drug with the light buzz
I respect it, cause if she know, I will
Give you what you want, give you what you need
Ugh, holla back, Rule baby

Now do my niggaz wanna fuck tonight? Hell yeah
How many Ladies wanna fuck tonight? We do, we do</pre>
