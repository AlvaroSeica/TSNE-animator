[Trey Songz]
maybe its the dude, maybe its the cool
maybe its my shoes, call em 22's
baby its ya phase, baby its ya face
baby its ya smile make me wonder how you taste
maybe cause the thugs say that I'm cool
maybe cause the girls wanna be like you
maybe its the ice that made ya look twice
maybe its ya back that made me look back
baby I look good with you
she know that you look good with me too
let me ride through the hood with you
show you to my boys cause oooh ooh you

[Chorus]
you so fly, I'm so fly
whats more fly than you and I together
get high lets fly together
I'm so fly, you so fly
whats more fly than you and I together
get high lets fly together

[Trey Songz]
Maybe take a cruise, sail across seas
we can never lose, baby not we
we can be the two true life of the party
baby what it do you know that you want me
maybe its the feel that I like you
got a nigga feel he can wife you
maybe its the fit that made me look slick
baby you the pick I make you my chick
baby I look good with you
she know that you look good with me too
let me ride through the hood with you
show you to my boys cause ooh ooh you

[Chorus]
you so fly, I'm so fly
whats more fly than you and I together
get high lets fly together
baby can we fly together
I'm so fly, you so fly
whats more fly than you and I together
get high lets fly together

[Trey Songz]
Baby don't, don't you take too long
I want you in my arms
if you feel what I feel bring it here to me c'mon
see we young but girl we grown
and baby I want to grow old
with you cause you know that you soo

[Jim Jones]
maybe its ya attitude that makes me a little mad at you
the same time the gratitude that make one speck cash on you
take you on trips you caught the longitude and latitude
let you hold the whip last time we almost crashed the coupe
so I laughed at you, cause we was drop pissy
it was 2 summers ago and you still rollin' wit me
but maybe its the loyalty, the way that you callin' me
when we makin' love when you scream put it all on me
or maybe my physique and my upcoming from the streets
I keep you running back, I got you coming in the sheets
from the first time I met you you become a little freak
I might go downtown and get something to eat
and baby you took care of me baby I took care of you
you cry I cry, baby I should tears for two
baby if the 7 karats didn't cost 300 grand
I would had the table and put some ice in ya hand

[Chorus]
you so fly, I'm so fly
whats more fly than you and I together
get high lets fly together
baby can we fly together
I'm so fly, you so fly
whats more fly than you and I together
get high lets fly together</pre>
