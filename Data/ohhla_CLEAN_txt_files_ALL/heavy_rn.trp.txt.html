[Verse One]
Let me connect the dots in your record shops
Life's here one minute and the next it's not, so
If you're low and you're moving slow just
Yell "Yallo!" man I'm letting you know
Everything in this world is connected one way or another
Although well hid under cover
By who? We don't know
Why? We're not sure but we feel like our feelings are real
And we really wanna trust our emotions, they all that we have
We just got promoted, we oughta be glad
But we're not 'cause there's something that gnaws in the back
Of our mind that could cause a collapse of our spine
And when we block it out it doubles the pain
So we... double the dosage again and again
Pretty soon we off track like a runaway train
Try to run from the fact, we all one in the same
And the pain that we cause is the cause of our pain
And it's strange and we lost to the laws of the game
Called cause and effect, who the boss, who the slave
Who to pay, who to hate, who to fear (who's to blame)

[Chorus]
They tell me that Europe is floodied by heavy rains
But we won't stop to think or stop our cars
They tell me that Europe is floodied by immigrants
But we won't stop the trade or stop the wars
They tell me that Europe is dying overweight
But we won't change our diet or change our lives
And I tell you that children are crying over it
But to them nor us, we won't stop lying

[Verse Two]
Shit, I don't really know where to begin
It's not like I'm on the outside looking in
I'm right here in it, right between, get it?
I'm too close to even see, too deep in it
I gotta take a step back to get the whole picture
While we use and abuse but wonder why we're addicted
You think to free 'cause the of the land you on
But no man is an island and stands alone
The very moment you think you're independent
Your evil acts coming back with a vengeance
'Cause your wealth is based upon the next man
Who probably can't even pay his own rent and
Have to work for a couple of dimes
In your factory so he can build up your empire and
Everything goes around 360
If you can't see come out here with me
The pain that we cause is the cause of our pain
And it's strange and we lost to the laws of the game
Called cause and effect, who the boss, who the slave
Who to pray in which God who's the plague (who's to blame)

[Chorus]
They tell me that Europe is floodied by heavy rains
But we won't stop the thing to but stop our cause
They tell me that Europe is floodied by immigrants
But we won't stop the trade or stop the wars

[Verse Three]
My boy drink 'cause he alone but he alone 'cause he drink
And when someone come along, cupid miss 'cause he's limpin'
Away from the obvious, outsiders see
but in a way we all followers choose not to heed
The warning signs, blinking all the time
Thinking I've seen the big picture, I know the big trick to skip the pitfall
Slip through the net, I'm sick of it all but I bet I regret
Not pushing my way through fightin' and tryin'
I'll step on some toes, try to live like I'm dying
But some say the karma come back
So we facing the stab in the back 'cause we so quick replacing
Friends with our frenemies, who's left defending me
When tables turning, I'm stuck in a dead-end street
No one I know and I know that fo' sure
But now it's so late and there's nowhere to go
The pain that we cause is the cause of our pain
It's strange and we lost to the laws of the game
Called cause and effect, who to force, who to play
Who's the force, who's afraid, who's the prey (who's to blame)

[Chorus]
They tell me that Europe is floodied by heavy rains
But we won't stop to think or stop our cars
They tell me that Europe is floodied by heavy rains
But we won't stop the trade or stop the wars
They tell me that Europe is dying overweight
But we won't change our diet or change our lives
And I tell you that children are crying over it
But to them nor us, we won't stop lying</pre>
