Typed by: AZ Lyrics

uh, its the emcee (the emcee), yeah
yeah, you can be the prettiest
I'd rather be the gritiest
Crafty Plugz

I minipulate the modern dialect
words that I select
can be a higher threat then a man in a private jet
flyin by ya set goin dumb fast
since Pun passed I aint found an MC to admire yet
my intellect in affect when I drop the info
before I step on stage I give a propper intro
never go pop, hip hop is what I'm into
use the key to unlock the mental
I'm master of the rhythem and tempo
you'll never catch up, try to make an attempt though
you off to a slow start, me against you
thats like an F1 race car against a go kart
I'm so sharp, they used to gas you up too much when you was young,
now you nothin but a no fart
the whack opponent played [?] like Casanova
thats it I'm here for the throw down, pass it over

It's all over, Casanova
It's all over, Casanova
It's all over, Casanova
It's all over, Casanova

It's all over, Casanova (uh, yeah)
It's all over, Casanova
It's all over, Casanova
It's all over, Casanova

uh, yo
I dont know what kind of fantasy world you stuck in
sleep on me if you want but dont get tucked in
too comfortable, 'cause at the crack of dawn
when the wake up call comes it'll be too late to act alarmed
I activate the bomb to detinate
blow your career to smithereens, and not a second late
I'm here to set the record straight
I crack your cd in half, if its cassette, then i'll eject your tape
select a date, we can battle live
how about the monday your album drops, see if you'll survive
I'm on the war path, best move aside
otherwise say goodbye, 'cause its suicide
when you go against the pro-lific notion
I compose flows deep as the pacific ocean
right stroke, left stroke, whats the best stroke
word up yo, they be drownin in my quotes

It's all over, Casanova
It's all over, Casanova (yeah)
It's all over, Casanova
It's all over, Casanova

It's all over, Casanova (uh huh)
It's all over, Casanova
It's all over, Casanova
It's all over, Casanova

check me out, uh, uh, yo
I'm double extra large, evidently charged like wilson elliot
my pen skills is ill, they aint ready yet
[?]... so my editorials are part of the source, I'm here to charter the course
ya'll needa follow the leada like Rakim gave the orders
'cause we behind enemy lines like great reporters
tape recorders and cam corders, but they see the man slaughter
you aint gotta go beyond the damn borders
watchin news see cops confused
good guys gettin shot so we gots lots to lose
I dont pop the [?], I hop over obstacles
padded my rhymes like how a boxer moves
laced each line wiht lots of jewels
bad for ya whole hood and leave ya block confused
on behalf of real MCs, props are due
Djs and rap artists and pop lockers too, holla

It's all over, Casanova
It's all over, Casanova
It's all over, Casanova
It's all over, Casanova

It's all over, Casanova
It's all over, Casanova
It's all over, Casanova
It's all over, Casanova

It's all over, Casanova
It's all over, Casanova
It's all over, Casanova
It's all over, Casanova

It's all over, Casanova
It's all over, Casanova
It's all over, Casanova
It's all over, Casanova</pre>
