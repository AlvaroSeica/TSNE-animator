[Mr. Sancho]
Uh
Uh
Uh
What's up, mija
You wanna come to roll with Sancho
Uh
Uh
Uh
Let's go and take a ride, baby
I'll show you how to do this
Come on

(Verse 1)
I love it when we in the low-low
Drop the top and feel the wind blow
Blow
Blow
Like I say, it don't really matter where we go
Just me and you, all alone, on the open road
And you love it when I do that thing
That thing, that thing that makes you move
You're the perfect level, perfect base
Trebel, perfect tone
Now baby, take the steering wheel
But don't lose control
When you grab my clutch and shift it
Make sure that you do it slow
Baby, you're my rider, rider, rider
Baby, you're my rider, rider, rider

Chorus: Mr. Sancho
We can ride in my low-low (Low-low, low-low)
Baby, it don't really matter where we go
We can ride in my low-low (Drop, top, slip and slide)
That's the way you like it when we ride

[Chorus]

Bridge: Mr. Sancho
Girl, you looking so fine
I just wanna make you mine
We be making love all night
Making love until the sun rise

(Verse 2)
Love it when I do it fast
But baby, for now, let's do it slow
Slow
Slow
Raise the droptop, I don't wanna stop
Cause I know that you getting cold
Cold
Cold
Cause nobody could see us
Go ahead, relax and put your feet up
I'm
Gonna raise the heat up
Make your body sweating like a fever
Hit my switch
Watch it bounce
Guaranteed
You can never wear me out
You know what I'm about
In and out
Make you shout
So so loud
So, girl are you ready? (Ready, ready)
I know that you're ready (Ready, ready)

[Chorus] - 2X

Repeat Bridge

[Chorus] - 2X

[Fingazz]
You can ride
In my low-low, baby
Ride
In my low-low, baby

[Mr. Sancho]
It's Sancho
