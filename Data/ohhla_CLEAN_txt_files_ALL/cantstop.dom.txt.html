"Nothing's gonna stop, nothing's gonna stop, nothing's gonna stop me" 2X

[Intro: Dom Pachino]
Yeah, ain't nothing gonna stop me, you heard
They can't stop me now, nada, zilch, zip
They can't stop me, yo

[Dom Pachino]
They couldn't stop me when they locked me, knocked me for clapping papi
Should of never test my manhood, knowing I'm no damn good
See what the streets made me, see what the streets gave me
It's knowledge that can't be taught in no classroom
Think about my past and how the shit flash, zoom
Back to the future, back to the man
Back to the father, back to the friend
Back to the brother, who lended a hand
To another in need, now ain't that a brother, indeed?
But some others, are smothered in greed
To know for sho', I must make 'em bleed
To the point where they passed out, damn
Now that nigga assed out
On his tombstone, we should write why he got mashed out
It's called justice and ain't no one excempt
My advice don't bother to make an attempt
I bet you think, you're shit don't stink
Let me rub your face in it and see what you think
I threw everything at him, plus the kitchen sink
Remember my first deal, I was young then
I dropped five g's on a Linc'
I was stupid, then, yo
I know I had the thought then, that they can't stop me
I know I sound a little cocky, but they can't knock me
For believing in myself, it's hard enough to do so
When you ain't got wealth, and there's no enough food on they shelf
But we still got by, I was bred wit the heart and the will to survive
And a skill to make cake, enough heat to bake pie
Enough gear to stay fly, enough truth to not lie
In the booth I'm that guy, if I'm street, you know why
Life wasn't easy when you live amongst the trife and greasy
But I didn't let it, and I wouldn't let it
I just couldn't let it stop me, man
