Song:   Bang Out
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Chorus: Jasmin Lopez]
Bang out, 'til the sun comes up
The wheels fall off and the drop collapse
Cause I bang out, keep my glock in hand
While you're posted up, chillin wit'cha mans
Bang out, won't catch me sleepin
While you in the club, goin out for keeps
Cause I bang out, shots go off quick
Catch yo' ass butt-naked while you wit'cha bitch
Cause I bang out

[Snoop Dogg]
I toss up the set
I walk up in this bitch with some gold on my neck
Yeah nigga, I'm controllin the set
Rock and roll on a bitch then grab ahold of my dick
Uhh, I pop a hole in your clique
So you don't wanna fuck with this
One nigga found on the ground we don't fuck around
D-O-double-G Pound, L.B.C. style

[Interlude: Jasmin Lopez]
Victory, is mine, and no one shine
Ain't no need to try, can't stop my grind
Keep, my pen, in hand, goin on for mine
If, you did-n't know, just press rewind
Victory is mine

[Chorus]

[Snoop Dogg]
Eastside Long Beach Rollin 20's
Yup, we fully wid'dit
Yeah, we wear dem black and gold coats
with the patch on the back that's says "Stealers"
A lot of niggaz wanna do us but they cain't
cause it's hard to get wit us
Watch out for them sliders, boy we riders
Heavy hitters, Eastsidaz, yeah
We shoot first, talk later
Nigga y'all hater, Doggy Dogg spray ya
And then I slid away
Smooth lil' getaway, did it with a chill today
I'm gonna need a hit a day
I live my life like I was John F. Kennedy
Mm, nah, I won't be sent away
Fuck a cop, non-stop, 20 Crip, all day

[Chorus]

[Interlude]
