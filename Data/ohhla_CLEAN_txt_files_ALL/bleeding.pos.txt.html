[P.O.S.]
It's been a bit; you look a little sick
You got the vibe of a ghost and I'm not equipped
But I can host, or I can drive
And a ride might be right, just hit the gas and crash
Tonight, must have been a beast
I bet you still rock a sweater in the heat, right?
And you can stand like it's not that bad
But I only hear from you when it is, and you know that

[Slug]
My agenda is pure, I'm sure you remember
The dialogue that occured, I would render
The whole campus blue
If it was just another blender to manage through
Guess it depends on the day to day
Most days I don't even wanna see your face
Don't say that you don't need love; it's old
Act tough but your blood's exposed

[Chorus - Slug]
I like the way you comb your hair
And I love them stylish clothes you wear
You've got some lights you're down to share
It seems as if you want to care
Good luck; the game you play ain't fair
Still stuck on why you standin' there
We'll keep your name inside the prayer
Tear down that self-made cross you bear

[P.O.S.]
I've been your ride the last few years
I've seen you through when no one's there
I finally get why that's the case
We let the liar lie in wake
Up, it don't deserve my sleep
And I can't catch a wink 'til you stop, 'til you think
'til you're clean, 'til you quit, 'til you're done
This is it; I'm at the end of my rope
You're at the end of your wick

[Slug]
Midday with your bright stage light and your
Mistakes, more weight and the frame might
Give way to the offbeat dance 'til the
City and the concrete cracks in here
I still watch you 'cause I believe
There's somethin' true beind your teeth
It's in them secrets that you keep
Fish outta water trying to breathe

[Chorus - Slug]
I like the way you comb your hair
And I love them stylish clothes you wear
You've got some lights you're down to share
It seems as if you want to care
Good luck; the game you play ain't fair
Still stuck on why you standin' there
We'll keep your name inside the prayer
Tear down that self-made cross you bear

[Slug]
Bear with me, it's wrong to stare
But somehow I'm on it like it's what you wanted
Now I'm here, whistlin' a song and tears
Might fall on a pair of distracted ears
Are you, listenin' it's the sound of toy hancuffs
And another voice you can't trust
Disrupt the self destruct
Waitin' for the ball to hit the ground
Just to watch it bounce up

[P.O.S.]
Up, and down the same steps
We've both have climbed that bind and connect us
I still feel the itch sometimes, but it lets up
You scratch 'til you bleed; you bleed just to prove life
So you can see it with your own two
But it's mixed with a mess and it's not you
Can you hear me past the heartbeat?
Or do you only know I care when our eyes meet?

[Chorus - Slug]
I like the way you comb your hair
And I love them stylish clothes you wear
You've got some lights you're down to share
It seems as if you want to care
Good luck; the game you play ain't fair
Still stuck on why you standin' there
We'll keep your name inside the prayer
Tear down that self-made cross you bear</pre>
