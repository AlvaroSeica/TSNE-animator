Yeah, I think I think it's time now
I I think now is the time, I think now is the time

Verse
Yo who you see arising, realigning from the horizon
Reemphasizing disintegrating all enterprises
Destroy your synthesizers quintessential in your projects
Fix your optics regulating all equalizers
They theorizing on manners for keeping us divided
Demonizing, all men are equal in the eyes of Isaiah, Moses, Jesus, and Muhammad
Pre-Islamic, is he Alexander the Great, a Caesar, or a prophet?
Prehistoric knowledge, Leviathan and three enormous monsters, Neo and Morpheus
CEOs storming out their corporate office
Witness the growth of an artist fuck Bonaparte and Josephine
I married Joan of Arc
Broken livers in a stolen heart
Open bar, grab yourself a drink Po be the man that be close to God
Causing the planet to shift angles and perspectives
Couldn't follow the Legend with ankle detectors
Or GPS's, Legend is VVS'ing
Bout to hit the airways, record soon to be BDS'ing
My MP3 got your garbage CD ejected
Break your whole shit down/ McAfee can't protect ya
Alfa and Omega Rap epitome, previously only a God could tap this energy
Bad chemistry, vortexes are formed
Fuck around and catch a sick one like raw sex with a whore
Or I be the Zeus to you rappers
Napoleonic in this musical rapture
Your whole set is clitter, I'm a three dimensional spitter
History won't mention you niggas
My rhyme style is loco
My only motive is to put a chokehold on the game for them to ride my
locomotive
Leave the scene bloody, broken noses
For trying to block my cheddar hot stepping like Ini Komozi
Napoleon, watch me closely- socially
Catch an energy blast for standing close to me
You know the con came way before Edison
The Myth Or The Legend beginsÂ….come get your medicine

Yeah, I seen it- I seen this happen before
From the four corners of the world
Napoleon Da Legend- The Grimey Gentleman
Here and now I'd like to welcome the world</pre>
