Roll the red carpet out
("You oughta give him a CRAZY praise!")
 
[Evidence]
Ten Commandments, 24 hours
The 13th floor was missin in the towers
Hmm, I thought I shouldn't be here
but stayed an extra day because they said it's Leap Year
Who's the wolf in sheep's clothing?
Fuck it~! The rabbit hit the drum and kept goin (Still goin...)
Each word is the church and minister
Approach, I coerced the listener, so listen up
Gettin park bench rhythms up, 'til I vision the
flow, I stay at home, sitting visitor
Radio, I visit stations nights
It's kinda like they fuckin visitation rights (right)
This ain't the place for my face in lights
I'm type driven living in a fuckin shadowless life
Uh, I dilate like pay attention
Slow Flow just arose when mentioned
I didn't die lately, I just slept on bed springs
Can't define people, I just see dead things
It ain't just rap, I body ladies in one line
Talkin slick to three chicks on text at one time ("Hey!")
I've seen shattered words, they left broken pieces
Lines undone, half uncompleted
To be continued, dot dot dot
Cliffhanger, my life is like I'm scalin the rocks and it's on
 
[Chorus: cut and scratched by DJ Revolution]
"Hard rock, hard-hittin, hip-hop hard-CORE~!"
