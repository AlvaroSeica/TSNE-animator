[Lady K]
Soon I will, bring down
We're the trouble of the world
Trouble, of the world
Trouble, of this world
Soon I will, bring down
We're the trouble of the world
I'm goin home, to live, with God
No more, weepin and wailin
No more, weepin and wailin
No more, weepin and wailin
I'm goin home, to live, with God

Trouble, of the world
Trouble, of this world
Yes I will, bring down
We're the trouble of the world
I'm goin home, to live, with God</pre>
