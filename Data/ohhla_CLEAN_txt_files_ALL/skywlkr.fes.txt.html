[Intro: Fes Taylor]
You gotta have swag to pull this one off
It's like ya'll rappers scared to make money, huh?

[Fes Taylor]
Breeze wit the top down
Kinda cool when you eating at the top now
Still move like a player from the Chi-Town
I'm S.I. bound, now I take the top down
I ride around, what up, ma, jump in the car
Pull in the hotel, you can jump on the rod
I 'bust a rhyme' like 'oh my God'
Playing wit the big joker, I hold my cards
Place ya bet, pace my steps
Park Hill Project, the place I rep
Like Henry the VIII, I make my reps
So I still chase paper til I face my death
After we say grace, what's left
Drop a jewel, out my chain or my bracelet I left
Know the ones that's struggled, embrace this best
We ain't have nothing, got a taste of the best

[Chorus: Fes Taylor]
Fly, fly, fly, fly
Fly, fly, fly away with me
Fly, fly, fly, fly
Fly, fly, fly away with me
I'm so high, I can touch the sky
So proud, I can walk on the clouds, say it loud now
I'm so high, I can touch the sky
So proud, I can walk on the clouds, say it loud now

[Fes Taylor]
We on the come up now, shorties smile
Hoes looking at the kid like he come up, how
I ain't trick no bread, I just run up town
Trying, to flood the town wit a couple of pounds
Last vacation, we spent ten thou'
You know, sky high, looking down from the penthouse
Haters rather see me in the big house
So I make a couple bucks, slide 'fore the pigs out
Big chain looking like he switch lanes
When the light hit 'em like the signal flashing
Nigga you ain't balling, you single flashing
Plus I'm still single, I mingle in Aspen
You a hasbeen, I was getting cash then
Fucking with broads, pop ecst' like aspirins
Past tense, he ain't been back sense
Came back with a suntan and an accent

[Chorus til fade] </pre>
