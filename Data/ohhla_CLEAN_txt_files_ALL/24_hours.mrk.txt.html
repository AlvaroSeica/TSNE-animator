We communicated with fans and drew diagrams
Rapped to live bands and shook many hands
Analysed as the sands of time fell in the hourglass
How many rappers can last?
When you throw a pebble in the river the ripples expand
I must develop a style they understand
Not too difficult or scientifical
And not your typical but still lyrical
So I can maintain respect on a street level
The world's the river and my words the pebbles
When they connect watch the ripples spread
And keep spreading till it vanishes
Create an infinite thought
And dreams that I must chase so suffer the consequence
Build a fence as a form of self-defence
If ever they attack we don't respond
If ever we attack, we attack with rhyme bombs

24 Hours every day
We organise, eat, sleep, communicate
Put together beats, rhymes, cuts
Analyse, build, attack

I figure self analysis and journeys that are hazardous
Build the character while on stage I'm like a scavenger
Amateur damager, cannibal animal
Lyrical murderer, maniac, volatile
Free flowing, mind blowing, crowd catching,
Captivating audiences with rhymes and scratching
Gift of the gab, working harder than your average rapper
I'm 39 steps ahead of you
My brains ticking constantly
Sometimes it feels like its flooded with supreme intelligence
Take me to your dealer, I know what I need now
Call me clever coz I listen when you talk
They shaped you, moulded you
I stuck to my original plans and kept digging
Deeper, further, there's mud in my eyes
The tunnel vision is my escape route
I'm leaving forever soon as I get a chance to

24 Hours every day
We organise, eat, sleep, communicate
Put together beats, rhymes, cuts
Analyse, build, attack

Separate the good from the bad
Innovate, create styles you wish you had
Exhibit A: Wordplay
Crush a fool any day
Take your breath away before I make my getaway
Anyway, further evidence, exhibit B
Cross the enemy lines, make them remember me
Double check facts killing fads and phoney acts
You weren't even born when I was backspinning and busting raps
Exhibit C my apology
I cleverly severe competition heavily
They'll never be better than me
Information held on analogue technology
Forthwith equality, understand my terminology
I plead insanity lyrical vanity
Speak with clarity I got multiple personalities
Whoever, whenever, whyever, whatever, however I feel
We react and remain forever

24 Hours every day
We organise, eat, sleep, communicate
Put together beats, rhymes, cuts
Analyse, build, plan, attack

24 Hours every day
We organise, eat, sleep, communicate
Put together beats, rhymes, cuts
Analyse, build, think, attack
