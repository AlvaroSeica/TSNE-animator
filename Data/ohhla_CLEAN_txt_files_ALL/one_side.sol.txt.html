[Intro: Ruben, (Solomon Childs)]
Uh huh, Peace Momma, Peace baby, What's good baby
Go head and shake it, Uhh huh, (Yeah) Feel my pain.

[Solomon Childs]
It's almost all gone, Baby girl I'm almost all gone
And it's funny when your gettin money
Everything in your circle wanna touch
Except the one you wanna touch
And you go harder, Lookin to stay away
Fightin the temptations you deal with every day
And your partner in the arms of somebody else
And it's hard, People don't see it, You gotta hear it from somebody else

[Mario]
Tell your Mother, It's alright
Tell your sisters and brothers, It's okay
Your friends around the way, Tell em calm down
Cause they don't even know we gone work this out
Cause that's how it starts right there
Tellin everybody I'm here
What's goin on between us
We can't let, Let em all in here

[Chorus: Mario]
Cause everybody aint for us
Especially me, When they only hear
One side of the story and that's your side of the story
Then they make up their own story
I wonder what would happen if they only heard my story
That I love you only, Baby can't you see
They don't know about you and me

[Mario]
I got an idea we should get away
Somewhere with the view of the ocean for a couple days
All night, Girl we can make break up to make up love
And clear our minds, Nobody there but us
And if the phone rings, Let it ring
If there's a knock at the door, Let em knock
If it's the end of the world, Let it end
At least I'll be with my girl yeah

[Chorus]

[Mario]
When they see you cry, They don't know I'm high
When they feel your pain, They gone know I'm worse off
But I hold it in, Til I see you again
Cause I don't want to answer to nobody but you

[Solomon Childs]
I was spotted down town, Two rows, Wrestle Mania
Watchin Big Show fight Floyd, We so neighborhood tabloid
During commercials of Flavor of Love
But they don't understand, Nothin can stop this love
Cause it was built off of real love
That slick Rick ??? love with so much uniqueness
Yeah, Baby girl this is my side of love

[Chorus]</pre>
