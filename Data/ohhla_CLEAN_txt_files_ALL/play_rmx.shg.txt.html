[Intro: Big Shug] (DJ Premier) {Termanology}
Yeah man, all I'm sayin is (Remix...)
Just play the music, play all of the music, man
We gotta keep some balance in the game
Y'know? Let it play man, f'real (f'real!)
("Remix!") Uh-huh
Big Shug, Preemo, you know the deal
{5'9", Termanology! Singapore}
Just play these records man, all of em
DJs', all around the world

[Big Shug]
This year, I'm not fuckin with coward cats
who hide behind they raps and flashy Cadillacs
Scared of the battle raps and semi-auto gats
But wanna push wack rhymes from artificial cats
that wanna feel the purple haze and spots with cate-gorys
Swimmin pool with dime chicks, spendin happy days
With all my niggaz blaze, honey dips gets glazed
And I'm paid a hundred grand when I hit the stage
This is not a phase, it's a real, nigga's rage
And I'ma make sure I get it before I'm back in the cage
I promise to shoot and blaze, 'til my dyin days
'til DJs' stand and my music's played
Any beef with me'll end in castastrophe
I'm winnin while you losin, thats how it just has to be
From the vinyl, to the CDJ
Give the fans a chance to hear the fly shit I say
Play the record or get smacked clean
With another bangin joint from Big Shug and DJ Prim'
("Play it") Play it! ("Play it") Play it!
("Play it") Play it! ("Play it") Play it!
("Play it") Play it! ("Play it") Play it!
("Play it") Play it!

[Chorus: Big Shug]
Let the music play, ayy  ("You know we get down!")
Let the music play, ayyeyaay ("On the microphone"
