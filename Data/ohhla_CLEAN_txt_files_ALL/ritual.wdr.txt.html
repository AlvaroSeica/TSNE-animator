What is a ritual?
A ritual is something every man do around his house or
any time of the day, every man got his own ritual that he does
to keep himself alive. Music is my ritual
The language you speak, is that part of the ritual?
What's that?
The language you speak, is that part of the ritua?
That is the ritual

(wispering)

(chorus)
Make him feal ohh-ohhhhh-ohhh  x4

Verse 1:
Janey got a babyyy
Prostitutes walkin'
Police just hit the house down the street
Ol' man wit a sign, he want somethin' to eat

(chorus)

Verse 2:
Where my next check comin' from?
Hey, Where my next check comin' from?
Am I gone have to ruuunn?
I aint goin' back to jaaaiil
Aint got no lady of mine
'Bout to run up the street, get me a bottle of wine
Aint got much time left, in the streets
Not much time left

(chorus)
