Verse 1
{Yella Boy}

I was creepin' through Newtons gave my boy some fuckin' dap
I looked to my right and lil' hurt was about to strap
I rocked upon the mic I made the whole crowd clap
Tec-9 was in the back with boo-koo bitches on his lap
Bigge de bouncin' through the pot hos was on my j
I'm givin' eye to eye to this lil' freak named Renee
Spittin' much game and my game be cold
Now why them hos be sweatin' me
Because of the vibes of the Kangol

Chorus

Tell ya bout this time things they got wild
They got wild they got wild they got rowdy
So let me tell you about this time things they got wild
They got wild they got wild they got rowdy

Verse Two
{Tec-9}

Everybody buck wild because it's Sunday night
Music got it goin' on and it's kind of hype
Lil' Ya is on the mutherfuckin' mic tonight
Got the bitches pussy poppin' so we keepin' it tight
My nigga Pee Wee in the back rippin' shit up
He asked me would I grab the mic I said wusup
Ya know I slowly approach the mic wit my hand
Everybody was clappin' to what I was sayin'
Till that nigga from the other side shouted out
Mutherfuck that third put a boot in yo mouth!
Got damn nigga trippin' must be on that shit
Cuz before the bitch knew I was gettin' dat lick
As I knocked out the big mouth who fucked up my show
I told him it was sent around so it's time to go

Chorus

Tell ya bout this time things they got wild
They got wild they got wild they got rowdy
So let me tell you about this time things they got wild
They got wild they got wild they got rowdy

Third Verse
{Lil' Ya}

Sittin' in the club lookin' real sharp gee
Niggas break out fightin' uh oh its gettin' rowdy
Hos in the front try'na break it up I'm chillin' in the back
Try'na get my fuckin' dick sucked 
Ya see they distracted about wards
They servin' them hos come up drivin' and shoppin' in fancy cars
But me I'm just chillin' like a fuckin' villain
Step against the chrome and there will be another killin'
Somebody's on the mic rockin' the bitches
Lil' Slim my nigga Pimp they shit was tight
Nigga lit up a blunt the hos was nothin' nice
The big man started to make fight
Chairs started flyin' in the air 
But when you at Newtons nobody don't care
Then Ms. Tee poped up on the scene 
With that I don't give a ( I don't give a)
You know what that mean bitches weigh tires
With the fuck me Yella they was straight eddie bowin'
Who the fuck is Tec-9 a nigga with a lot of dog bitches
On his mutherfuckin' mind then I head of Juvie of Valence street
Down wit playa they call him lil' Gangsta Dee 
Newton was wild that night gee that's the same night 
Every fuckin' thing got wild

Chorus

Tell ya bout this time things they got wild
They got wild they got wild they got rowdy
So let me tell you about this time things they got wild
They got wild they got wild they got rowdy

Verse Four
{Yella Boy}

I slowly moved to the bar to get another slow gin
I turned back around hands was goin' in the wind
A nigga can't walk straight he full of that fuckin' dank
Walked up to another nigga that was drunk and waist his drink
He said ya blow my fuckin' high so nigga don't apologize 
I Feel ya about to play me like a ho suddenly ya bout to die

Chorus

Tell ya bout this time things they got wild
They got wild they got wild they got rowdy
So let me tell you about this time things they got wild
They got wild they got wild they got rowdy

Fifth Verse
{Tec-9}

Now I can't understand how a nigga sweat a bitch
Gettin' all pumped because yo ho in my shit
If ya tell her in her face ya fucked her
Then that uptown bitch wouldn't disrespect ya
You don went and got yo whole posse for me
Ya tried to test my nine to see if I was a gee
Mutherfucker as I pop my trunk let me see dat ass run
But the bullets from my gage put ya on front page
All the shit that went down didn't even make since 
When they put you in the bag i was diggin' up in yo bitch
As I left the scene everybody started to watch me
I got to get the fuck before them people try to rob me

Chorus

Tell ya bout this time things they got wild
They got wild they got wild they got rowdy
So let me tell you about this time things they got wild
They got wild they got wild they got rowdy


Everything is wild yo that's not my style
I like to keep my game smooth like the water in the Nile
Why shits always startin' while a nigga is try'na chill
Every fuckin' night ya hear somebody's gettin' killed</pre>
