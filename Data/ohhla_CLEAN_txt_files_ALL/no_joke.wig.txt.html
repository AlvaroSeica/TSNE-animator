[Shawn Wigs]
I used to bag ounces of coke, now I
Ski on tracks like the beats a slope
Rock a coat cuz the 45 King's a pope
Old school Eric B. beats are dope
I'm taking it back, you getting like 45 lessons
I just spit, a few rhymes in four or five sessions
And now, I got a mixtape to mount your career, so
Step to the rear, it's Wigs on arrival
Raised on the Island, spittin' darts for survival
Run around town with the dimes and the super gats
It's me and O, man, you just might catch a heart attack
Run, I'm telling you I ain't no joke
Ghost pass the ounce of murders, and I'm ready to smoke
See my Dutch got way more flavor than you
So I hope you ain't the nicest one out of your crew
This is cake to the God, like all praises due</pre>
