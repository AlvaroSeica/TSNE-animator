[Opening Skit: Crooked Patrol Cop singing]
Now, I'm listening you communists, niggaz and jews
Tell all your bodies to spread the news
Cause their judgement will soon been alight
As the lord in this wisdom looks down from height
Well, it's better be lost my mixing the races
We want beautiful babies, not ones with brown faces
Never, never, never, never, I say
Cause the Ku Klucks Klan is here to say:
Never, never, never, never, I say
Cause the Ku Klucks Klan is here to say:
Here's two clunches are bitter with lynches in their lyrics

[KM.G]
When you're ballin' in the neighborhood
And you have to fade your strap, cause it's like that
That's Uncle Sam's Curse

[Kokane] 
Uncle Sam's Curse, uncle Sam's Curse
Uncle Sam's Curse, uncle Sam's Curse

[KM.G]
If you're a rebel and you're moving the product
And everybody hates you, that's Uncle Sam's Curse

[Kokane] 
Uncle Sam's Curse, uncle Sam's Curse
Uncle Sam's Curse, uncle Sam's Curse

[KM.G]
If you're workin' from nine to five on the old plantation
In this U.S. nation, that's Uncle Sam's Curse

[Kokane] 
Uncle Sam's Curse, uncle Sam's Curse
Uncle Sam's Curse, uncle Sam's Curse

[KM.G]
And if you're prayin' on a fool to jack
And you don't care about the colour
Even if he's black, that's Uncle Sam's Curse

[Kokane] 
Uncle Sam's Curse, uncle Sam's Curse
Uncle Sam's Curse, uncle Sam's Curse

[KM.G]
If the mailman's late with your Government cheque
And they cut it, the motherfuckers, that's Uncle Sam's Curse

[Kokane] 
Uncle Sam's Curse, uncle Sam's Curse
Uncle Sam's Curse, uncle Sam's Curse

[KM.G]
And if you're walkin' in the mall and you're wearin' blue
And there's a nigga wearin' red starin' at you
That's Uncle Sam's Curse

[Kokane] 
Uncle Sam's Curse, uncle Sam's Curse
Uncle Sam's Curse, uncle Sam's Curse

[Hook: Cold 187Um] 
Hell yeah, ugh, since we in here, man, 
Why don't you set some shit off man before we get the fuck out of here?

[KM.G] 
Awww shit, we're wicked
I swear, I'll sweat your ass
Yeah, the Clinic came to blast
We're lookin' for them fake gangsters
They're handin' out the murder raps
Yeah, they're shakin' suckers like craps
Shit comes to pass, nigga
I hope you're not the victim of a raper
And let a nigga take your paper
And run, and live life swell
While you're rottin' and rhymin' in a cell
Now break yourself, nigga, how the hell you figure?
You used to need gas money home
Yeah, I guess the Gs are full grown

[Cold 187Um] 
Yeah, now it's time to play, the motherfuckin' clone

[KM.G] 
You're actin' all stupid like you don't know where we been
We buyin' a gang of gats, so tell a friend "Tell them"
That God put us here, to innovate first
Now the world's given, uncle Sam's Curse

[Cold 187Um]
See, I don't trust man, nigga, only trust God
So when it's on, bow down to the Black Mob
I be the dark skinny nigga representin' from Pomona
In the Rag-Top-Trey, on them dark corners
Yeah, cause I'ma floss for mine, and I'ma toss for mine
To let you know, that it costs for mine
Yeah, cause I'ma come like a true nigga
And for lunch, I think I won't fly twice, nigga
Awww shit, aww shit, we're goin' off the deep end
We're all off the hook and we're flowin' like the wind
I'ma take off on your ass like a LearJet
And if the shit gets deep, you gonna get wet up
And out of the luck, tryin' to fuck with the original
I used to slang dope, but now I get residuals

[Hook]
[Kokane] What's your name? 
[187Um] One eighty seven 
[Kokane] What's your name? 
[187Um] One eighty seven
[Kokane] What's your name? 

[Outro: Cold 187Um] 
One eighty seven
If I hear you diss my crew, it's on, forever!!</pre>
