Typed by: AZ Lyrics

They say money is the root of all evil
But I think it's people
So many friends say they would die for you
But they lied to you
You were one I thought would never betray me
So where you been hiding lately
Huh, it's kind of funny how you played me
Like a violin, thought we would die as friends
Caught in your lies at the end
We could start over and try it again
I never knew our friendship could be so cut throat
Dear mister stranger, listen to this letter I wrote
You sold me out and that's the reason I hate you
You got a free ride home and I didn't even get a thank you
You thought you could just walk away from this
Tell me how does it feel to finally have to pay for this

[Chorus]
Now tell me who's your friends
HA, because you never know
I can't forgive, I can't forget
And I can't let it go
'Cause time changes, and love changes
And best friends become strangers
Now tell me who's your friends
HA, because you never know
I can't forgive, I can't forget
And I can't let it go
'Cause time changes, and love changes
And best friends become strangers

They say time heals all wounds
But I'm still bleeding
Seeing friends become enemies
Now what's left nothing but bad memories
I'm feeling confused, used and left stranded
I'm feeling played and betrayed
I know you planned it
I know you thought you left me empty handed
You know where Yas &amp; Bobby are headed and you can't stand it
God damn it
You see I never knew our friendship could be so cut throat
Dear stranger, listen to this letter I wrote
You sold me out and that's the reason I hate you
You walked away and I'm glad I had to replace you
You made your choice now you can live with it
Tell me how does it feel to finally have to pay for it

[Chorus (2X)]

Misfits, strangers, liars, friends
Misfits, strangers, liars, friends
Misfits, strangers, liars, friends

You sold me out and that's the reason I hate you
You and I were friends I thought we'd die together
You sold me out and that's the reason I hate you
You and I were friends, but nothing lasts forever
You sold me out and that's the reason I hate you
You and I were friends but you stabbed me in the back
You sold me out and that's the reason I hate you
You and I were friends but now there's no turning back

[Chorus]</pre>
