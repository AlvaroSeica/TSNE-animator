(Get on up)

Say what?
I could never ever diss my homegirl
(Get on up)
I could never ever diss my homegirl
(Get on up)
I could never ever diss my homegirl
(Get on up)
I could never ever diss my homegirl
(Get on up)

My homegirl, she's my homegirl
My homegirl, she's my homegirl
My homegirl, she's my homegirl
My homegirl
Yo, what's up?
My homegirl, she's my homegirl
My homegirl, she's my homegirl
My homegirl, she's my homegirl
My homegirl
(Go off)

[ Boogie Knight ]
My homegirl is not my girlfriend
She's a female that's so genuine
I've had em older, had em younger, females of the world
I max and relax with my homegirl (word)
We never ever tongue or nothing like that
We go to parties and the movies and of course we rap
My girl can't stand her, she swears we're (messin)
My boy said if I ain't messin I'm (fessin)
People of the world, let me teach this (lesson)
A girl's not made for only caressin
I'm Boogie Knight, I say to you
My homegirl makes life easy to go through
I hang with the homeboys, we chill, we talk
Where there's 24/7 nonsense I (walk)
Coolin out in the Uptown world
I max with Kim, she's my homegirl

[ both ]
I could never ever diss my homegirl
I could never ever diss my homegirl
I could never ever diss my homegirl
(Say what?)
I could never ever diss my homegirl

[ Boogie Knight (&amp; Romeo JD) ]
She knows me (I know her) we grew up (together)
I can't stop (how I be for a new lady)
She's my friend (I'm her friend)
Got her back (thick and thin)
And it's all (from within)
Can you peep it? (Peep this)

( *scratching of* )
(People dancin)
(Get on up)

[ Romeo JD ]
When I'm feelin kinda down and I'm mad at the world
I just shoot Uptown to pick up my homegirl
Cause she knows how to make me cool on out
There ain't nothin in the world we can't talk about
She loves me like a sister and I love her like a brother
Yes, we're in love but no, we're not lovers
When we're walkin Downtown we hold hands and chill
If anybody tries to diss her, then I will get ill
Cause I protect her to the end, won't let nobody (hurt her)
If she ever needs a friend then I can never de(-sert her)
We're always straight cause neither one of us is phony
She's my homie and I'm her Rome
There might be a time we're playin husband and wife
To get the discount tickets on a honeymoon fight
On a round-trip journey all around the world
No foolin, I'll be coolin with my homegirl

[ both ]
My homegirl, she's my homegirl
My homegirl, she's my homegirl
My homegirl, she's my homegirl
My homegirl
Yo, what's up?
My homegirl, she's my homegirl
My homegirl, she's my homegirl
My homegirl, she's my homegirl
My homegirl
You know it
