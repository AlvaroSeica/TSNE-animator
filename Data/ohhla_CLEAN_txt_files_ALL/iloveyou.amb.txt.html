[Chorus: Erica Arthur]
I love you Jesus, yes I do
I love you Jesus, yes it's true
I love you Jesus, yes I do
I love you Jesus, yes it's true

[Verse 1]
Satan is the choice of the majority
Jesus seems to be the choice of only the minority
But He's the ultimate authority we call it sovereignty
The most pre-eminent so He's got the most seniority---follow me
Without restraint who knows how hard the heart'll be
The world, flesh, and devil formed a three-man comradely
And my block could be proof and so can anthropology
Sin has long since become man's hottest commodity
Everything from robbery to Sodomy
To improperly getting cash to girls who flash like photography
Without properly understanding biblical prophecy
You can't possibly see where the stop will be

[Chorus] - repeat

[Verse 2]
Meet the God who died for me enduring all the verbal mockery
Got to be cause He loves me like women love a shoppin' spree
His agape be the love that got to me, He adopted me
Now I'm in the family and I'm God's property
And periodically some youth will want to copy me
As I copy the Saviour so no more living sloppily
And as I start to get wobbly, God'll be
Mercy and Grace the ultimate team like cheese and broccoli
They make up for what we lack 'cause of our poverty
Fills in the gaps and the cracks up in our pottery
I believe I'ma die for sure not probably
"Or you can get raptured" --- you're right, possibly
But I'ma share my philosophy, logically
I know I don't want hell Galapagos are too hot for me
If it's not for free and salvation's got a fee
I can't stand it I'm like Titanic out to sea
Sure to be abandoned like bad stocks will be
But no need cause Christ hit the jackpot for me
That's why I love Him

[Chorus] - repeat

[Verse 3]
You know the world she's my ex-girl she keeps calling' me
Cause we used to go together kind of like your cars and keys
I was a fool, but we were cool as an autumn breeze
'Til I met the God who parted seas---pardon me
I had some bad rap and R&amp;B
Ought to be considered as dangerous as clogged arteries
The flesh and Spirit's been warring like dogs and fleas
The God in me told me He's attacking all disease
It's getting hard for me to ignore the spiritual part of me
That wants to hear Christ and not just lyrical artistry
I want to please the One who stretched out His arms for me
And though I failed Him He let the nail Him on a tree
By now you're probably on to me
I think the Son's hot, hotter than high noon summer street corners be
To the only God who gave a Son because He wanted me
To Him all the praise, all the glory, and the honor be

[Chorus] - repeat</pre>
