[Danny!]
Y'all know how we do
So what's wrong with you?
Y'all niggas draw pictures, followin' these niggas' style
Stop cheatin', copyin' not even worth niggas' while

[Verse 1: Danny!]
I, once was retired but he's sort of back
Haven't been the same since Uncle L sneezed on a track
(Heee-shay!) I'm 'bout to throw some D's on the 'Lac
Sike...my guest appearances is cheese for the rats
Pease porridge hot? Nah nigga, pease porridge black
Please pour a batch of Singaporan tea, more than that
Y'all gon' need some bigger cups if you fuckin' with me and Naledge
Even college was a hustle to him, like me at Claflin
We is laughin' at the competition deviously
So much accomplished, Wikipedia's peeved
They can't keep up

[Chorus: Naledge]
Shit, I make a rhyme a day
Just so I can keep the milk carton away
While these wack niggas, they tryin' to lead you astray
Naledge Born and Danny Swain here to take you away, so
Without further ado
Let us take it away 'cause it's been a long time
And I know we shouldn't have left you
But we're here now, so respect's due

[Danny!]
Guess who!
Y'all know how we do
So what's wrong with you?
This nigga, big picture; sick spitter, sip liqour slow
Patiently waiting for my shine and my time to blow

[Verse 2: Danny!]
Peace to Ted Bassett
I'm a beast on these beats, Easter egg baskets
Naledge Born, drop the science

[Naledge]
This is an order for rappers to be silent
Witness the birth of a legend, "Jelly Bean" Bryant
808 tyrant, taste-maker
Our taste make us, 'cause what I make taste gourmet
Like crab cake, courtesy of Wolfgang Puck
I am God in the goal, like Earl at the Ruck'
Or Wayne with a puck
Ain't drop 'cause Jarett ain't payin' enough
But I stay on the cut

[Chorus: Danny!]</pre>
