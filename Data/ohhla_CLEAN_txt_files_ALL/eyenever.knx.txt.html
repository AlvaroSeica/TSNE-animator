[Intro: Bumpy Knuckles]
Always payed attention to, how many cats I would rock with or who I worked with
On projects and everything 'cause, you know, what's important, is 
To stay focused on the growth, of your brand, you know, every mc is a brand
You whether you wont admit it or not
You know alot of cats out here screamin, how they just love hip hop so much
And they rock for the love and all that, wish I could walk into Best Buy and say yo!
I've been buyin from y'all for mad years yo 
And it would be my honor, if y'all let me rock one of them flat screens right there.......word...
PREMO!!! BUMPY KNUCKLES!!! DJ PREMIER!!! LET'S RIDE

[Verse One: Bumpy Knuckles]
Used to be money in the hood, then crabs started havin baby crabs
And all them niggas wanted to be Scarface
While I stayed on my Oliver Stone, enroll images
Bodyin top mc's you lost scrimmages
Mic on ampid, the warior holla is how I stamp it
Stash box, popped open
We at war for the people, loyalty's a damn maker (WORD)
Steal royalties a deal braker
CHECK! Mic check one, two, is what I do
Before I spit that real nigga shit at you
And feed you that mc tsunami, then I have you niggas cryin for your mommy
Punk try me, come on

[Chorus: DJ Premier scratchin sample from "In Da Club" by 50 Cent] (Bumpy Knuckles)
F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-Focus man (I never put my focus away)
(Word! Come On! Underground boom bap Bump's droppin!)
F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-Focus man (I mix it with the vocals I lay)
(WHAT! OG's show the streets really what's poppin)

[Verse Two: Bumpy Knuckles]
Come on! Peep niggas verses, subliminal bitch shit
I bitch slap rappers who bitch quick
Eye swole bisquick (POW!) Huh! Hit you with the biscuit
And grab the mic and butter the room, like a biscuit
Soaked into the mind of rhymes that make you feel like you can do it
Like the Nike sign fuck what you wear
Can you right these rhymes, that don't conform
Can you spit 'em over and over in classic form
Yo! Streets playin dirty, a hot sixteen a get you thirty, years
When keepin it real goes wrong black man, I put the pen to composition
Destroy competition, a soldier's in position
I'm loyal to my pen, you loyal to your chain
That you bought with your lil' advance and knock cocaine
Real niggas got their hammers out, my niggas wildin out
I think you better leave the violence out.......GRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!

[Chorus: DJ Premier scratchin sample from "In Da Club" by 50 Cent] (Bumpy Knuckles)
F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-Focus man (I never put my focus away)
(Come On! Underground boom bap Bump's droppin!)
F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-Focus man (I mix it with the vocals I lay)
(OG's show the streets really what's poppin)

[Verse Three: Bumpy Knuckles]
I was born a follower, who learned to lead
Amongst low lives, shit bags who burn in greed
Criticize me when you reach my level, until then
Just admire my style of fire, it's fire
I build on mistakes and learn from 'em
Study my enemies and learn from 'em, then never turn from 'em (WORD!)
The higher you fly, the smaller you appear to the eye
Of those hate waited niggas on grown level.......DEVILS!!!!

[Chorus: DJ Premier scratchin sample from "In Da Club" by 50 Cent] (Bumpy Knuckles)
F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-Focus man (I never put my focus away)
(Come On! Underground boom bap Bump's droppin!)
F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-Focus man (I mix it with the vocals I lay)
(Premier! OG's show the streets really what's poppin)

[Outro: Bumpy Knuckles]
Salute to the game, don't ever put your focus away!</pre>
