[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Shake it girl, work it girl
Us thugs, we like them girlz

Little mama wit alla that (Heyy)
Let me tell you where the partys at (oohh oohh)
No Limits where the ballas at (over here)
We pop bottles like we quarterbacks
hey girl won't you do that dance
lookin good mami, won't you shake that thing
I like your style and the way you move
you make a thug wanna get wit you

[Silkk] When I come through Dawg you no I'm fly
[Master P] It's about to jump off
[Silkk] when I stop by

[Master P]
we ain't LL but we jus those type of guys
thugs in the club with them bottles in the sky
My wrist sittin on 24 carats
Rookies tuckin in they chains they must be embarassed

[Silkk]
I slide through grab a couple of bottles
later on fly threw grab a couple of models
you a balla you outside or in
I pulled up theres more outside then in
niggaz in the parkin lot sparkin blunts
like if you ain't on 20's or above don't park out front
some couple of dudes ran up the street
tried to park and run
get back to the spot
once I get back to the yact

[Master P]
I'm on the dance floor with trina and tasha
I'm a actor so its juice and vodka
tell the waiter more champagne for shorty
we in a V.I.P. and bout to get naughty

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Shake it girl, work it girl
Us thugs, we like them girlz

[Curren$y]
Call me on a sunday
you no a dawg could roll through
in a black 350z with no roof
excuse me I don't no what they told you
but I'm gettin in for free anywhere that I go to
curren$y the high spitter got hella flows
rock platinum rolls white, yellow gold
got the world in my hand won't let it go
I'm not a lightweight cuz I got heavy dough
young dude ice so chunky
game so smooth thats why they want me
ooh too cool way to flossy
if thats your boo you better get her off me

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Shake it girl, work it girl
Us thugs, we like them girlz</pre>
