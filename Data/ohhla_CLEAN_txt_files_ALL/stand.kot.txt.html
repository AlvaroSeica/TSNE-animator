Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Richter]
If you dont stand, stand up for something
Then you will fall, youll fall for anything, yeah

[Daddy X]
Lifes kinda funny man
Little crush you hear like this beer can
Youll stop your soul and watch you blow away, yeah
I know youve heard all this before
So ill save your ears from gettin bored
Ill tell you this man, I dont roll that way, no way
I take the bull straight by the horns
I grab the rose and I cut the thorns
Cause I was born to roll tight to my dyin' days, yeah
They wanna see us suffer man
Wanna smack you down with their pimp hand
They will make you dance and tax you til your grave
But im not a slave

[Chorus]
If you dont stand, stand up for something
Then you will fall, youll fall for anything
You got to stand, stand up for something
Or you will fall, youll fall for anything yeah

[Richter]
Now this one goes out to all my brothers n' sisters'
No matter if your home, locked up, or unlisted
Use your voice, use your mind and your soul
To make a change in this world for the good of us all
But choose your battles, you gotta choose em wisley
You gotta pick your wars, the ones that are worth fighting
Cause its kill or killed in society today
If you dont stand for what you want
Then it gets swept away,
By the big companys and ...?... monopolies
Or our government that picks on is people on the streets
We need to speak, use our freedom of speech
If you believe in what you preach
Hey now well then preach
Let them know what you think, let them know where you stand
And if you feel it in your gut then stand like a man, stand
Total proud stand for those who cant
Get up and take a stand til you MAKE em' understand

[Chorus]
If you dont stand, stand up for something
Then you will fall, youll fall for anything
You got to stand, stand up for something
Or you will fall, youll fall for anything yeah

[D-Loc]
Stand up and stay true, you gotta always be you
No time for ?blinks? you gotta do what you do
Know what you what, who care what who think
Born to be a leader, watch you follow my lead
Raised by a tough man, teached me well
Taught me believe in myself and good health
Work hard, be stong, and dedicate yourself
Make wise decisions and invest your wealth
So I stand, like a man, with my family, for something yeahh

[Chorus]
If you dont stand, stand up for something
Then you will fall, youll fall for anything
You got to stand, stand up for something
Or you will fall, youll fall for anything yeah</pre>
