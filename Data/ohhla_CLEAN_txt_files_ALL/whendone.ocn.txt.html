[Frank Ocean]
Sittin next to your coffee table
I'm tryin to fix your cable box, again
Said you couldn't get channel 4
And that's the only one you wanted to watch

[Pre-Chorus]
Last week I was walkin your dog
Baby scrubbin your dishes
Took your clothes to the cleaners
I don't mind, cause

[Chorus]
When I'm done, when I'm done
I'm gonna get every little bit of your love
When I'm done (I'm gon' get it)
When I'm done (and you gon' get it)
You gonna feel every little bit of my love

[Frank Ocean]
Spend all day in my kitchen slavin
Uhhh, you didn't even know that I could cook
But you said you're tired and you're ready to go
Yeah, girl you didn't even touch your food, no

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus] - 2X

[Frank Ocean]
Well, gimme some mo' baby, gimme some mo'
It's never enough baby, you gotta let me know
You need something, tell me something, gather somethin to hold
Baby I'll do it

[Chorus] - 2X</pre>
