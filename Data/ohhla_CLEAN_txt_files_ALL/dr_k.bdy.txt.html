[Opening Skit: Sampler of Land Line beep]
[+] Hello! Suicide hot line, please hold
[-] FUCK THIS!!

[Verse One: Ernie C]
Prozac attack, I'm feeling whacked
My damned boss, won't give me no slack
Disconnected phone, I didn't get that loan
It seems like everything's going wrong
I'm unemployed, flat broke, out of luck
Ain't got no hope, when it seems like it ain't no way
Call up the doc, he'll be with you right away

[Chorus: Ice-T]
You think your life is tough? - call Kevorkian (Pathologist Jacob "Jack" Kevorkian)
You think your life is tough? - call Kevorkian
You think you're out of luck! - call Kevorkian
When you had enough!

[Verse Two: Ernie C]
Need some Xanax, want some pills
Cause I don't like, the way I feel
Can't sleep at night, can't get no rest
I want the grim reaper, as my guest!
Missed my bus, missed my plane
Life it seems, like a constant pain
Think it's bad, it could be worse
Call the doc up, he'll pick you up in a hearse

[Chorus: Ice-T]
You think your life is tough? - call Kevorkian (Pathologist Jacob "Jack" Kevorkian)
You think your life is tough? - call Kevorkian
You think you're out of luck! - call Kevorkian
When you had enough!

[Overvoice]
You're gonna just kill me

[Chorus: Ice-T]</pre>
