Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
Me and my niggas go dumb, is go stupid
Me and my niggas go dumb, me and my niggas go stupid
Me and my niggas go dumb, me and my niggas go stupid
I told you bitch I told you [x8]

[Verse 1]
My swag like Raymond, bitch I look amazing
Fuck everything, bitch, my show still 100 grand
Bitch, I can't hear you
Bitch, look it's Based God
Fuck that bitch, I will not pay her rent
Bitch tried to lie, you're fronting me the pussy
I don't want the pussy, ho you know I touch ass
8 Girls on me everyday, are you out your mind?
Bitch, I ain't lying, I ain't got nothing to lie about
Bitch, I don't cash out, fuck paying your damn rent
I ain't your baby-daddy, your baby-daddy's a mascot
I hate these stupid bitches who be lying all the fucking time
Bitch trying to lie on me, bitch I want privacy
Bitch, suck my dick, cause I know you gon' lie to me
Ho out here trying me, bitch you ain't gon' ride for me
I'm out here struggling and this Green Flame my dynasty
Based World behind me, you gon' have to push that line on me, you bitch

[Chorus]
Me and my niggas go dumb, is go stupid
Me and my niggas go dumb, me and my niggas go stupid
Me and my niggas go dumb, me and my niggas go stupid
Me and my niggas go dumb, me and my niggas go stupid
I told you bitch I told you [x8]

[Verse 2]
Ask anybody, Lil B sell out shows
Lil B do what he want, fuck the rules
And I'm a tell ya, fuck these suckers
And I'm a tell ya, fuck these busters
I got that scope with the long range, with 50
I'm a show you 'bout the game, whoadey
I'm a show you that black flame and that blue flame, whoadey
And I'm still on my dick, bitch, and I ain't even like that, whoadey
So, why you up under me
I'm a tell you like this, bruh, why they don't fuck with me
Bruh, I push that early line, that's why they don't fuck with me
And I ain't giving out no passes, these niggas out here stuck with me
Man, this Green Flame on life, they couldn't fuck with me
Man, ten years ago, man, these pussies still couldn't fuck with me
I'm out here riding solo because these busters got funk with me
And I'm a tell you like this, bitch, there only be one of me
The highlight of a girl life is when she fuck me

[Chorus]
Me and my niggas go dumb, is go stupid
Me and my niggas go dumb, me and my niggas go stupid
Me and my niggas go dumb, me and my niggas go stupid
Me and my niggas go dumb, me and my niggas go stupid
I told you bitch I told you [x8]</pre>
