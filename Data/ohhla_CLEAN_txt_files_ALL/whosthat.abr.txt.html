[Verse 1]
Who's that knockin' on my door?
Mr. Hartman
I'm just an artist
Just gettin started
Just a part of the planet
My plan is to chart all the progress
I'm just being honest
I got a fondness for smarts
It's the hardest growth to achieve but I believe in the harvest
But what I don't perceive is a market
I'm no Magellan, no sailin', no targets
I'm no Delano
Hell no
Pardon my hardened slice on the mice up in the garden
I'm carvin' a new niche
"My, aren't you kitsch?"
Nah, I'm just parked in the margin
I've just landed like Marvin the Martian
I'm markin my territory
I'm the sergeant
Leading this army of varmints that aren't regarded as ardent
But pardon, we're starving

[Chorus]
Knock knock
Can I get up inside?
I've been waiting in line all my life
On my mind all this time all I find is a lie
But I'll leave that out here if you'll just let me inside
Knock knock
Can I get up inside?
I've been waiting in line all my life
On my mind all this time all I find is a lie
But I'll leave that out here if you'll just let me inside

[Verse 2]
Who's that knockin' on my door?
Abraham
But next time I'm asked yo I'll just say "a man"
Understand what I am is a plan devised by creation's hands
I'm taking a stand
And demanding when changing from ape into man that we raise as a clan
Remain as a family
And can it be we raise our hands when the shit hits the fan?
Stand the beneath the canopies
And if we ever gave a damn we'd be saved from the bland
Expand from the waves to the land
I'm breakin the strand full of faking with brands
And behaving like laymen with our brains in our hands
I'm everything I say that I am
Now I'm aching to wake up and shake up the sand
That is falling from the hourglass
Every time a hour passes by I'm asking why we're still taking exams
The test is over

[Chorus]
Knock knock
Can I get up inside?
I've been waiting in line all my life
On my mind all this time all I find is a lie
But I'll leave that out here if you'll just let me inside
Knock knock
Can I get up inside?
I've been waiting in line all my life
On my mind all this time all I find is a lie
But I'll leave that out here if you'll just let me inside
Lemme get inside, lemme lemme get inside
Lemme get inside, lemme lemme get inside
Lemme get inside, lemme lemme get inside
Lemme get inside, lemme lemme get inside

[Verse 3]
Who's that knockin' on my door?
My name is Jesse
I'm not here to teach you so why you wanna test me?
Yeah this could get messy
So let's be balanced and not get dizzy like Gillespie
I'm just an MC
Sweet like a Nestle treat or a Pepsi
But still I am the
One who is here to steer whoever's empty
And fill them with care the dare is so tempting
I'm just attempting to be inventing
I believe in ending the pretending
I've achieved and seen a relenting spirit and I hear it every time I rhyme
Blending the answers with questions
My candor is senseless
I'm bursting and quenching your thirst with my venting
And I'm sending a vocal message
And I am not texting
I'm not texting

[Chorus]
Knock knock
Can I get up inside?
I've been waiting in line all my life
On my mind all this time all I find is a lie
But I'll leave that out here if you'll just let me inside
Knock knock
Can I get up inside?
I've been waiting in line all my life
On my mind all this time all I find is a lie
But I'll leave that out here if you'll just let me inside
Lemme get inside, lemme lemme get inside
Lemme get inside, lemme lemme get inside
Lemme get inside, lemme lemme get inside
Lemme get inside, lemme lemme get inside
Lemme get inside, lemme lemme get in-side
Lemme get inside, lemme lemme get in-side
Lemme get inside, lemme lemme get in- side
Lemme get inside, lemme lemme get inside</pre>
