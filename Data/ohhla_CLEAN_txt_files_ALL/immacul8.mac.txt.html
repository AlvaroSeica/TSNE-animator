[sample]
I dedicate to this program to the National Guad
But we're fresh out hillbilly music
But we know better, don't we?
We know about the 14 year old girl
The trigger happy guardsman shot last night
And the people they beat up
And the black businesses they destroyed, don't we?
It's almost time...
10 seconds, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, blastoff

[Intro: Timbo King]
Yeah... Bo Bo Bo, Maccabeez
Got macks to squeeze (cock and load)
Bo Bo Bo Bo, yeah...
Bo Bo, Maccabeez, let's go

[Timbo King]
For retrospect, I'm king of this metrotech
To the next millennium, I'm Clarence 13X
This the real it's gon' get, with no special effects
My fours leave the scene when the tech's on wreck
Yeah Mickey D's the boss, cuz he walks with a 'big mac'
Niggas went to jail, came home and got sent back
Blacker than '60's, compared today
The media, never air what we had to say
Blue steel in the hour of chaos, revenge
Composer of street music, Bozart, the man with a gold heart
Silver lungs, my duty is to teach the young
(You don't want none...)
Bitch rappers go run inside they daddy's house
We on the blocks with them caddy's out, bladder out
Yeah we liable on the stage, ya'll cats jatted out
Ya'll them haters acting mad about, what the fuck ya'll brag about?

[Interlude: Timbo King]
Maccabeez, Maccabeez Militia
Ya'll can't fuck with me, ya'll can't fuck with us

[Timbo King]
Yo, for the projects, niggas throwing objects at niggas
Smack niggas, jack niggas, one of those rap niggas
Hold your square, my circle is gunning
I've been popping shit like this, since my uncle was numbing
Stay dumb off the green gum
Bitches on the dick wanna see me cum
Income, outcome, all bums, albums
The streets wanna know, why and how come
Maccabeez... niggas get smacked the fuck up

[Hell Razah]
The icon of the Renaissance, the blast word on the intercom
That transform like Decepticons
I get my greenery from leperchauns
Ya'll better make sure your vest is on
We turn Brooklyn to Lebanon
Shoot at the police with no grief
Bloody your white sheets, fuck Alexander the Greek
We got the streets yellin' 'revolution', against the devil's movement
My sixteen in the constitution
And I be very ruthless, another young Huey P. Newton
Maccabeez don't obey laws, we came to kick down doors
And break bread with the one 44
Why you fake niggas hating me for?
My metaphors got your gay niggas cancelling tours
We handling whores like Max Julian in The Mack
Niggas scared to be back, Christ is black, but the church don't tell
you the facts
Since the Towers collapsed, we still hustling cracks
Keep gats poking out of the sides of throwbacks
Cadillacs on 22's, you know how money do
Have Judas sell you out for 30 sheckels
We rebels and law breakers, got you scared to face us
Til then, all death to haters</pre>
