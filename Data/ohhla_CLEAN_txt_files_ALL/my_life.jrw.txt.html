Y'all want to live my life
Y'all just can't live my life
Y'all want to live my life
Y'all just ain't fit to live my life

[Verse 1]
Since a youngin a lesson was told (told) was never to fold (fold)
Shit I started rappin around 11 years old
I was destined to blow (and what) and unlikely to fade
Copped me a pen and pad (and what) see my life in the page (page)
Nobody seen my vision (vision) they thought I'd be in prison (prison)
They though I'd be in prison for movin keys of ism (nope)
But as you see I didn't I just succeeded, listen
Now they watch when they spot every V I sit in (eert)
Let me stick to the plot (plot) since a kid I would watch (and what)
My favorite channel was the music video box (uhh huh)
Daddy Kane, Rahkim, every hit he would drop (who else)
Flu Dog, Wu Tang, down to Biggie and Pac (Pac)
I inherited charm (charm) but in a house hardly (why)
Cause was beggin my moms (for what) to hit the house party
Shit to dance, not a chance I was in there for that (that)
I was highly inspired (by what) just hearin 'em rap (rap)
They would crowd the mic (and what) and indeed get it crackin (crackin)
Of course I was too short to see who was rappin
I ain't bother to speak, just startled by heat (heat)
Listen to all of the words (and what) and nodded to beats
That's when I decided (to what) that that was my goal (goal)
To rap and to flow (flow) my tracks to be sold (ohh)
All across the country (country) for the coast of money (cha chaing)
Until the life the dreams or the lost and hungry

[Hook]
This a movement you see, all this movin you see
Basically this is more than just music to me
This is tears and sweat, for the tears I sweat
Every year I stretched I won't dare forget
This a movement you see, all this movin you see
Basically this is more than just music to me
This is tears and sweat, for the tears I sweat
Every year I stretched I won't dare forget
Y'all want to live my life
Y'all just can't live my life
Y'all want to live my life
Y'all just ain't fit to live my life

[Verse 2]
I was likely fixen to pop and the ciphers with a bop
13 felt like one of the nicest kids to drop
More practice I done made, the more nicer that I got
People loved me, I end up ghost writin for the block (I remember that)
Mama said I was a fool (fool) and I wasn't cool (why)
Cause round 14 shit I done dropped out of school (whoa)
Yeah that was my past (past) broke, rap was my cast (cast)
Getting caught writin rhymes in the back of the class (uhh huh)
I was trifling to all (all) I hit Dykeman for raw (raw)
Shot 5 with the students (students) rolled dice in the halls
They said dude take a T-O (why) almost caught with a kilo (kilo)
Principal threatened me (uhh huh) hey I'm callin ya P.O. (fuck outta here)
So drop out is what I had to do
Ciphered up the block (block) and battled on the avenue
Ran up on cats like faggot I will battle you
Battle what he babbled and I had him by a rap or two
