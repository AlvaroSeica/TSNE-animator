[Intro]
Here I go again, check me out!
Here I go again, check me out!
Here I go again, check me out!
Here I go again, check me out!
Here I go again, check me out!

[Verse One: Ice-T]
Another night, I sit alone in the dark
I can't remember my name, I stalk streets and parks
Shame on the nigga whose life aimed to sex with minds
Massive contusions, rivers of crimps and winds
Just member met, it's all the down remembering
Blood stains, pieces of brains under my fingernails
Screams kick, bites, bruises and yells
Nobody lives, so.. nobody tells
I wake up in my house all alone, bloody sheets, mud on my feet
Next to me attempt souls of death, I can't front son
Knives, Razer Blades, axes, and guns
Look at my chest, I got this glass cut
I get the needle and thread; and sew it up
Razed the shaves in this night again friend
You'll hear the shouts

[Chorus]
Here I go again, check me out!
Here I go again, check me out!
Here I go again, check me out!
Here I go again, check me out!
Here I go again, check me out!

[Verse Two: Ice-T]
Two ladies out late walking in the dark
The older city is dimmed from the fog
I approached from behind with the speed of the shark
I broke by dart, I ripped their backs apart
The violence is incredibly sex pushing me
I'm a blood fiend, makes me bust nuts in my Jeans
Yeah, I think I wanna keep the heads
I love to peel off their faces and wear with the dead skin to bed
The dogs bark and bite at my feet
As I leave, they dragged the headless bodies down the street
I make it home, take a bath
The water turns red in the aftermath
I waked again in this night, uhh.. I passed out no doubt

[Chorus]
Here I go again, check me out!
Here I go again, check me out!
Here I go again, check me out!
Here I go again, check me out!
Here I go again, check me out!

[Verse Three: Ice-T]
My head echoes with voices of terror
My next victim, is in the mirror
Seems like I have seen him before, I can't quiet recollect
All I know is that the voices say: Slice his neck!
I cut up his hand, the blood sprayed from his wrist and burst
The warm started to crunch my nerves
I stabbed him in the eye with my knife made him surgical steel
Oh what I feel, electrical shocks with my brain
Came like I have never left before, sweet pain
I love it, I love it and I want more
Pulled out my straight Razer Blade hit his jugular
I'm looking at the ceiling now, I'm wondering where we went and how
He couldn't escape nothing that's fate
I can send it to the gates of hell and let my soul mate
Side to heaven and the devil is my final bout
You'll hear the shouts

[Chorus]
Here I go again, check me out!
Here I go again, check me out!
Here I go again, check me out!
Here I go again, check me out!
Here I go again, check me out!</pre>
