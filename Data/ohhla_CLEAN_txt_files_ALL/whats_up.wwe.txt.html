[Intro: R-Truth]
Whassup?
Stand up and say whassup?
What's, up? {*repeat 3X*}

[Chorus]
People over there whassup?
If you feel me, stand up and say whassup?
Whassup? (Whassup?) Whassup? (Whassup?)
Whassup? (Whassup?) Whassup? (Whassup?)
You can get with this, or you can get with that
You better come get with this, cause this is where it's at
Whassup? (Whassup?) Whassup? (Whassup?)
Whassup? (Whassup?) Whassup? (Whassup?)

[Verse One]
I be skippin and jumpin and, leavin the competition
Makin 'em disappear like your favorite magician
I ride that {motherfucker} 'til the wheels fall off
And I bounce 'em back to back 'til they necks get soft
Most of the time you see me, I'm tryin to keep it simple
These are the type of people to get popped like a pimple
Statin my claim to fame
To be one of the baddest-ass {niggaz} to step foot in this game
And I haven't even started yet~!
But you can better believe I'ma yank it off a sure shot bet
Whassup? (Whassup?) Whassup? (Whassup?)
Whassup? (Whassup?) Say WHOA

[Chorus] - last "Whassup?" refain + "WHOA!"

[Verse Two]
Steady stickin and movin like there's no time left
I did it before the fall and like I lost my breath
Baby that's what happens when you snooze you lose
Grip yo' fate when you breakin the rules
They tellin me Jack was nimble, they said he was quick
But I bet that {nigga} can't do the {shit} that I did
Rippin and runnin the tracks, can't believe yo' eyes
The most gifted, intelligent surprise
It ain't even time to give up
I gotta be on my J.O. out like...
Be givin the dap back so you better watch out
And tell that {bitch-ass nigga} keep my name out his mouth

[Chorus] - same as last time

[Verse Three]
I'ma keep on pumpin and stompin as I please
I know you see me comin movin like a stampede
Been known for bringin the drama just to {fuck shit} up
It's all because of the drama that enough's enough
Bringin the entertainment, slash, top billing
Suntan Superman, Ron Killings
I be trippin and takin the risks, goin against the grain
Them are the reason and the cause of why I'm insane
Definitely makin impressions, and leavin you standin and guessin
My tongue be goin off like a Smith and Wesson
I can really get posted up, make noise and that's a fact
You better get ready for me, cause IT BE LIKE THAT~!

[Chorus] - same as last time to fade</pre>
