[Ice Cube]
This ain't Sinatra, this ain't The Carter
I am the chaperone nigga who brought ya
I am the author, this is holy water
From the holy father, the Rock of Gibraltar
Step up to the altar, step up to the slaughter
Get circumcised son and turn into a daughter
Niggaz know they oughta, drink the fuckin Kool-Aid
Industry laid out authorities they too late
Emcees past the due date, niggaz, they do hate
You are Bobby Bouchet, I'm the man like Cool J
I rock the Louis, but not like Kanye
Niggaz see me kinda like, Harry Belafonte
Step into the room they be like, ohh-kay-o
Yeah cause they know, a nigga ain't Play-Doh
Shots all fade-oh, is this Laredo?
Border town I knock 'em down just like Legos
Drink the Kool-Aid!
I make a motherfucker drink with the Kool-Aid ("Let 'em know")

[Chorus]
Do you? "Let 'em know" Do you? "Let 'em know"
Know who you fuckin with, know who you fuckin with
Do you? "Let 'em know" Do you? "Let 'em know"
Know who you fuckin with, know who you fuckin with
Always (always) always (always)
Know who you fuckin with, know who you fuckin with
Always (always) always (always)
Know who you fuckin with, know who you fuckin with

[Ice Cube]
I ain't the doctor, this ain't the patient
This ain't the nigga always on vacation
This ain't no white boy's rehabilitation
This is crazier than a boat full of Haitians
This is inflation mixed with degredation
This ain't no dead rapper's reincarnation
I heard it was a new West coast, I ain't worried
I murder mo' stars than Conrad Murray
I got mo' bars than the penitentiary
I wrote this shit without a rhyme dictionary
Young bucks try to step up, to the harem
lookin for some pussy I'm a old buck, I dare 'em

[Chorus] w/ minor variations

[Outro]
Drink the Kool-Aid!
I make a motherfucker drink with the Kool-Aid ("Let 'em know")
Drink the Kool-Aid! (Drink the Kool-Aid)
I make a motherfucker drink
{*scratches and Keith David samples*}

[Chorus] - to fade</pre>
