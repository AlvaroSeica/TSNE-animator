Chorus:

Keep their headz ringin (ring ding dong   \
ring-gading ding ding dong)               /  repeat 2X

Verse One:

[Hey you, sittin over there]                  Say what?
[You better get up out of your chair]         That's right
[And work your body down]                     Yeahhh...
[No time to funk around, cause we gon....]
Funk, you, right on up
So get up, get a move on, and get your groove on
It's the D-R-E the spectacular
In a party I go for your neck so call me Blackula
As I drain a niggaz jugular vein
and maintain to leave blood stains so don't complain
Just chill, listen to the beats I spill
Keepin it real, enables me to make another meal
Still, niggaz run up and try to kill at will
But get popped like a pimple, so call me Clearasil
I wipe niggaz off the face of the Earth since birth
I been a bad nigga, now let me tell you what I'm worth
More than a Stealth bomber, I cause drama
The enforcer, music floats like a flyin saucer
Or a 747 jet, never forget
I'm that nigga that keeps the hoes panties wet
The mic gets smoked, once you hear the beat kick
With grooves so funky, they come with a Speed Stick
So check the flavor that I'm bringin
The motherfuckin D-R-E, will keep they motherfuckin heads ringin

Chorus

Verse Two:

One-two for the crew, three-fo' for the dough
Five for the hoe (HOEEE!) six-seven-eight for Death Row
Mad niggaz about to feel the full effect of intellect
so I can collect respect, plus a check
Now I fin' to, get into to, my mental
will take care of this business I need to attend to, cuz my rent's due
And this rap shit's my meal ticket
So you god damn right I'm gonna kick it, or get evicted
I bring terror like Stephen King
A black Casanova, runnin niggaz over like Christine
When I rock the spot with the flavor I got
I get plenty of ass, so call me an ass-tronaut
As I blast past another nigga's ass that thought he was strong
but I smoke him like grass, just like Cheech and Chong
When I flow, niggaz know, it's time to take a hike
Cause I grab the mic and flip my tongue like a dyke
I got rhymes to keep you enchanted
Produce a smokescreen with the funky green to keep your eyes slanted
So check the flavor that I'm bringin
The motherfuckin D-R-E, will keep they motherfuckin heads ringin

Chorus

[Dr. Dre] Yeah, c'mon
[singers] If you, want to, get on down
[Dr. Dre] Uhh, yeah.. c'mon
[singers] you gotta get on down
[Dr. Dre] Hahaha.. it's like that
[singers] just get on down

Verse Three:

Debonairre with flair, I scare wear and tear
without a care, runnin shit as if I was a mayor
But I ain't no politician, no competition
Sendin all opposition to see a mortician
I'm up front, never in the back drop
Step on stage and get faded just like a flat top
Your rhyme sounds like you bought em at Stop N Go
Dre came to wax you so, just call me Mop N Glow
Many tried to, but just can't rock with
I'm 6-1, two-twenty-five, a pure chocolate
Your chances of jackin me are slim G
Cause I rock from summer til Santa comes down the chimney
Ho ho ho, and so, as I continue to flow
Cause yo, I'm just a fly negro
So, check the flavor that I'm bringin
The motherfuckin D-R-E, will keep they motherfuckin heads ringin

Chorus

[Dr. Dre] Yeah, uhh, c'mon
[singers] If you, want to, get on down
[Dr. Dre] Yeah, Death Row back up in that ass
[singers] you gotta get on down
[Dr. Dre] for the one-nine-nine to the nickel
[singers] just get on down
[Dr. Dre] so all you motherfuckers out there tryin to get with this
[Dr. Dre] don't even try it
[singers] If you, want to, get on down
[Dr. Dre] You couldn't see us with binoculars.. can you dig it?
[singers] you gotta get on down
[Dr. Dre] Ha hah, yeah, uhh
[singers] just get on down

[Dr. Dre]
I know you're bobbin your head, cause I can see you
UHH, I know you're bobbin your head, cause I can see you
You can't see me?  Hahaha, yeah
Death Row, let me know you in the house (BEOTCH!)
Yeah, that's right, we out..</pre>
