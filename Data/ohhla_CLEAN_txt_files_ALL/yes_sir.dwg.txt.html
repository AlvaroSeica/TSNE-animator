Chorus - 

You heard what I said (yes sir yes sir!)
You heard what I said (yes sir yes sir!)
I said you heard what I said (yes sir yes sir!)
You heard what I said (yes sir yes sir!)

Verse 1 - (White Dawg)

Run game, slang cane, Broward playas mane
Feel my pain, hit a switch come bouncin' mane
Slow grains, like Dre money fuck fame
Playing with a pistol while she like into my picture frame
Lay em down, don't fuck around come with it
When I hit it, bounce that ass and shake them fucking titties
Come with it, when I spit it, represent the city
Sold a rhyme for every dime, call me Frank Nitty

Verse 2 - (Dozia Slim)

Open up a can of whoop ass on yo bitch ass
Wanna fuck a thug bitch, give me head and cash
If the river runs dry ho, listen up
Call me back when that trick money stacks up
Got these medals on my chest from this pimp game
Steady bitchin' brains with these Broward playas mane
The pimp laws say you don't wanna cross
And if your contract is canceled bitch, it still ain't no loss

Chorus (2x) - 

You heard what I said (yes sir yes sir!)
You heard what I said (yes sir yes sir!)
I said you heard what I said (yes sir yes sir!)
You heard what I said (yes sir yes sir!)

Bridge (8x) -

We be some game runners, just some game runners

Verse 3 - (White Dawg)

Thug love, nigga got six slugs
Slang Texas, ain't where them niggas slang drugs
Popo ain't shit where I come from
So if you want some, nigga come get some
Met her at the mall, thirty minutes later in the draws
Talk shit get slapped in the fucking jaw
You know I'm holy, stack in the forty
Some died in the Caddy on some D's that was rolling

 Verse 4 - (Dozia Slim)

Talk shit get split, you heard what I said
Drop them 'bos on them hoes fuck em then they dead
Fire it up skraten up, who run shit
Game runners, ball playas, we run shit
Bring it on, bring it on, bitch buckle up
When I'm on this weed, I don't really give a fuck
In bed, catch head, gon' serve me
Bust a nut and I'm gone and I know you bitches heard me

Chorus (2x) - 
You heard what I said (yes sir yes sir!)
You heard what I said (yes sir yes sir!)
I said you heard what I said (yes sir yes sir!)
You heard what I said (yes sir yes sir!)
