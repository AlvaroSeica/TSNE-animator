[Intro: Michael Douglas - Wall Street]
'Read Sun TSu The Art of War
every battle is won
before it's ever faught
before it's ever faught
before it's ever faught
Think about it
give me guys that are poor, smart and hungry
and no feelings'

[Verse 1]
Draped in ermine
teaching rappers while I'm learning
cos I keep my eyes on snakes, pigs and the vermin.
I keep my friends close, but I squeeze my ho's tighter
and I need a toke, son, yo pass me the lighter.
They wanna deal with tokes
yeh they creaping again
but I'll put the leak to your brain
if you weaken the chain
I don't give a fuck if you speaking my name
but I'll fucking cut ya
if you speak it in vein.
Am I the devious, or the snake, or the ladder
or the stairs, out the back, or the elevator
coming back and back
and mine is on the stacker
out of fucking order
so I gotta wait, for the snakes
to come back in order
to separate the ones with the rungs
from the ones
with the forks for the tongues
they out for your funds.
So keep ya wits about you
check the former and the latter
use your grey matter
ask any dead rapper about...

[Chorus]
Snakes and ladders, you cud never tell
You never know what I'm gonna do next
Shit is like, snakes and ladders
I never fail
I play the game like its russian roulet
shit is like Snakes and ladders
you cud never tell
You never know where I'm gonna move next
Shit is like, snakes and ladders
jump up a ladder, up to the side
cos you can't decide

[Verse 2]
Rappers hanging from the noose knot
whose hot, whose not
whose got what, who's dudes got clocked.
Intricate, rhymes written in triplicate
using finite words
the combinations are infinite
Even walking under a ladder could make your luck badder
so I had ta, bun the, splif and wonder
how I keep from going under
in the jungle, my own mutherfucking uncle
L told me yo
the mutherfuckin'
snakes got the phones in my house tapped
praying that I fall for the mouse trap
I doubt that, but when the crowds clap
I despise jealousy
but a friend of a friend could be my enemy
He telling me, don't let them grab you
drag you back a square
You swear, you wont make the same mistakes
that got you there, yeh
know the rules, you could get schooled
or get fooled cos really
there's only two types of people overall...

[Chorus]
Snakes and ladders, you cud never tell
You never know what I'm gonna do next
Shit is like, snakes and ladders
I never fail
I play the game like its russian roulet
shit is like Snakes and ladders
you cud never tell
You never know where I'm gonna move next
Shit is like, snakes and ladders
jump up a ladder, up to the side
cos you can't decide

[Outro]
on a snake, watch out
there's fucking snakes out there
ladder, surrounded in smoke
snake, I don't give a fuck I don't know about you
or a ladder, you could never tell
snake, I don't give a fuck I don't know about you
ladder

Yo Smokee Tokess, light that inspiration
lightning striking like a python</pre>
