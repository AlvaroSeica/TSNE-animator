The "V" is for Virgin's fuckin' Virgin's
The "U" is for Unknown Unknown Unknown
The "N" is for Nothin' Nothin' Nothin'
The "L" is for Lowlife Lowlife Lowlife

I'm not a pussy ass nigga of off 6th and Baronne
Never bragin' stuntin' like I got a pocket full of stones
For U.N.L.V. we know they hittin' that pipe
Knowin' they never saw the rock in their motherfuckin' life
They better keep that shit round 6th and Baronne
I know I better not catch there ass on Heirhorne or Claiborne
Cuz that's where the real soldiers stay, if they talk shit
They get shot by the AK, rat-a-tat-tat that's the sound of my trigger
My heart got bigger, fuck a pussy ass nigga
Fuck a pussy ass nigga, my heart got bigger
An Tenth Ward hoe, make my dick get bigger
Fuck a pussy ass nigga, my heart got bigger
An Tenth Ward hoe, make my dick get bigger

[Chorus]
What do you call a nigga, that brags my man
I say you call that nigga, a fuckin' pussy n a can
What do you call a nigga, that brags my man
I say you call that nigga, a fuckin' pussy n a can

[Misdemenor]
Talk some more shit but another bitch ha-ha-ha
I had to laugh at that bullshit
This is the Meanor and I'm earnin' my respect
I got a lot of hoes, and I got 'em all in check
Not like Ya-Fat cuz they talk bad about 'cha
Say ya never fucked 'em, now I got doubt about ya
Silly fat fucker, settin' lies on his dick
Say he fuckin' hoes, but he ain't fuckin' shit
Check it out

[Kangol Slim]
What about that nigga who made that motherfuckin' Eddie Bow
He used a white man name, just to rock the crowd
The Eddie Bow, that shit ain't gonna work
We got a brand new dance and it's called the Twerk
First ya wiggle yo hip's just like you wiggle yo arm's
Now you doin' the fuckin' dance made up by Dejon
Now Twerk, Twerk, Twerk, Twerk, Twerk, Twerk, Twerk, Twerk
That's enough about U.N.L.V.
We bout to kick it about this bitch by the named of Heavy
That's enough about U.N.L.V.
We bout to kick it about this bitch by the named of Heavy
Always wearin' a tee shirt, cuz his ass is wide
Can't sport a Tommy Hill, cuz they don't make his size
Walkin' round town, talkin' bout he's a hustler
Fat ass bitch, need to use a gut buster
Do the gangsta walk, no that ain't it
Heavy's walkin' round the city with big fat tits
Do the gangsta walk, no that ain't it
Heavy's walkin' round the city with big fat tits

[Chorus]

[Bridge-Two-P-N-C]
Ain't nobody jockin' U.N.L.V. Style
Say ain't nobody jockin' U.N.L.V. Style
Ain't nobody jockin' U.N.L.V. Style
Say ain't nobody jockin' U.N.L.V. Style
There's only two U.N.L.V. nigga's
A fake punk pussy motherfucker, who's scared to pull the trigger
It's only two U.N.L.V. nigga's
A fake punk pussy motherfucker, who's scared to pull the trigger

[Kangol Slim]
Bang bang, bigelow, oo-e-oo-i
Bang, bang, bigelow wall-a-wall bing bang
Bang bang, bigelow, oo-e-oo-i
Bang, bang, bigelow wall-a-wall bing bang

[Misdemenor talkin']
What the fuck y'all nigga's know about that
Partners-N-Crime, and it's a Big Boy thing
We just like a business, like my nigga Bruce said
We can be cool, or just give me some gangsta shit
So call it like you see it, and if it's gotta be some gangsta shit
So be it, punk motherfuckers, punk motherfuckers</pre>
