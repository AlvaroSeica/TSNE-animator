[Kid Cudi]
Yeah, yeah
Relaxed and I'm thinkin, did I forget to mention
I'm sittin on a location, I call it new station
Constructing my best opus, motherfuckers ain't got no life
No vision, no ambition, no will to do a damn thing
They often spit greasy, and talk down on the nigga that be shinin
How is that readily, so mentrual psychology
Tamponic, stressful, overloaded jealous niggaz
I'm in my own world, literally no bullshit baby

[Chorus]
I keep a cool head, I keep a cool head nowwwwwwww whoa
I keep a cool head, I keep a cool head

[Kid Cudi]
Ay, ain't nobody trippin on, I'm cool, relaxed
I keep, my, mojo on, daaaamn, no turnin me off
I keep makin that money, that money, that money, yeah
Keep, my, mojo on, daaaamn, no turnin me off
Ain't nobody trippin on, I'm cool, relaxed
I-I keep, my, mojo on, daaaamn, no turnin me off
I keep makin that money, that money, that money, yeah
I keep, my, mojo on, daaaamn, no turnin me off

[Chorus]
I keep a cool head, I keep a cool head nowwwwwwww whoa {*3X*}
I keep a cool head, I keep a cool head

[Kid Cudi - repeat 2X]
They stay livin right in their own lies
In their own days in their holes
We see beyond the hate, we see a poor soul
who hasn't been told, they only know what they've been shown

[Chorus]
I keep a cool head, I keep a cool head nowwwwwwww whoa {*3X*}
I keep a cool head, I keep a cool head</pre>
