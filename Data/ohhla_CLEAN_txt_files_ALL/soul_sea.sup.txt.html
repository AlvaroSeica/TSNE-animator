Song:   Soul Searching
Typed by: heatpackrat

Y'all need some soul searchin'
Gotta find your sole purpose
Y'all need some soul searchin'
Gotta find your sole purpose

Dig deep inside, Dig deep inside, find ya
Dig deep inside, Dig deep inside, find ya
find your sole purpose

They say that I'm an old soul, trapped in a young physical
I'm so cold, only to certain individuals I don't know
Guess I matured at an early age, from watching niggas prematurely shift to the pearly gates
And witnessing your child arrive on the birth date, will help keep you
grounded, reminding you why you here in the first place
I need a place to rest my soul, so my destiny's controlled, so I guess, yes, that's my goal
I'm not trying to fall victim to the liquor and the Newports, and other
shit that you thought, would break my stride
That's the way I am inside, I make mistakes and fall from the 'greatest man alive'
I got addictions of my own, I'm trying to balance out instead
I got a past that seems to haunt me, every time I get ahead
I try to walk the right path, and abide by the gospel
In this day and age, that shit is damn near impossible

You gotta take time, do some soul searching
Make up your mind, find your sole purpose
Everyday you feel so worthless
Whatchu gon' do with your life
Whatchu gon' do with your life

So many nights I fight to clear my conscious, I'm just, being honest
I think I sacrificed my life, despite the fights with ma-dukes over nonsense
Somewhere along the line I gained the right insight
I should have gave my life to Christ more than once or twice
But it's the fear of back sliding that's pushing me back
My spirit could be intact, but I'm so engulfed in sin
That there is an opening in hell you can throw me in
I guess I'm in the same boat with my friends
Swimming up shit's creek again, and won't believe till I see the end
If I don't shape up, I'll know exactly where I'll spend my afterlife
Cause temptation is a bitch that's too hard to sacrifice
I'm far from an angel, far from a saint
And I really want to change, too, but deep inside I can't
It's real, I got some inner demons that I need to work on
I'm trying to get to higher ground like that old church song...

You gotta take time, do some soul searching,
Make up your mind, find your sole purpose
Everyday you feel so worthless,
Whatchu gon' do with your life
Whatchu gon' do with your life

I need to do some soul searching, find my position in life
Man, no one's perfect, yet, this is my life, picture my night's of insomnia
I can't sleep a wink, anxiety, but care about what other people think
I stare into the mirror, thinking 'what have I become'
A serpent, a person, am I worse than that bum, of a father
Who jetted on his first birthed son, left me and my momma stranded
marooned and abandoned
But then again I'm not as bad as some would say
but god ain't making no comparisons on judgement day
I need to change, but I'm stuck in my ways
I'm still suffering daily, I ain't really been feeling up to it lately
Barely get enough rest in, hardly ever have an appetite, my fam think it's signs of depression
That's not the case though, I'm just searching for my sole purpose
Finding myself downtown, to do some soul searching..

You gotta take time, do some soul searching

Everyday you feel so worthless
Whatchu gon' do with your life
Whatchu gon' do with your life
