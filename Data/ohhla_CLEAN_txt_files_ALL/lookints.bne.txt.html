[Intro: Bizzy]
Yeah, you know what it is...
Yeah, yeah, yeah, one time fo' they mind yo
One time fo' they mind yo
Get to 'em, get 'em baby!

[Chorus: Bizzy Bone]
See I know all about you, and I made you hot when you not
And now you talkin fast, actin like you somethin you not
So when I talk about you, can't even remember your name
Cause all these playa haters lookin the same, nigga

[Bizzy Bone]
I t-t-take a picture, with the quickness I come get wit'cha nigga
Stop ya ticker, read the scripture, dismiss ya then forgive ya
Got your bid, I don't know you, I don't owe you
A little quick forgetter, like you never existed in my picture
Take it to ya, it's like a nigga never knew ya
My homies they wanna do ya, I'm holdin 'em back from screwin ya
Ya wanna be me, in my business, you wanna be a rapper
You ain't Capo, you ain't Bizzy and you ain't dapper
Allah is God, Allah is my master, creator fly
You ain't fly, you would shoot me in the back like brother Ty
It's only I, who tried, to get you off the coke, crack
Focused your mind, and made you wanna go rap
How could you do me like that? And I still, gotta forgive
Got a clean heart, prosperous as I live
And now you know the truth, do what you do without me
You ain't gangsta, ain't gangin, ain't gankin a G 

[Chorus: Bizzy Bone]
I know all about you, I made you hot when you not
And now you talkin fast, actin like you somethin you not
So when I talk about you, can't even remember your name
Cause all these playa haters lookin the same 

[Bizzy Bone]
You a star or somethin, you ain't even Muslim
Wastin my time with your wack rhymes and your bluffin
Your homies are fruity, so I question if they even like coochie
Whatever happened to the pimpin that you said you was doing?
Got your people gooey, ain't ever seen me before
Man they don't ever boo me, never confuse me or
scramble my mind like I'm blind, and you hoes can't find
Look at you jealous of my fellas, I'ma chill and recline
You a dime, you a bore, you a toy indeed
You're not no joy so you make, prank calls to me
And what you see, is the real, how you feel don't brag
I don't care about your choices but I'm just not a fag 

[Chorus: Bizzy Bone]
See I know all about you, and I made you hot when you not
And now you talkin fast, actin like you somethin you not
So when I talk about you, can't even remember yo' name
Every playa hater lookin the same

[Bizzy Bone]
So Mr. crackhead, extasy poppin wannabe
Mr. coke sniffer, cock licker, wannabe Alicia Keys
I'm a rock-n-roller, holder of the heart of a G
And I promise you could never be me - don't even try it
It's too expensive to buy it, too extensive to sign it
Artificial feelin of drugs, can't even fly with it
So come and try it, you don't stand a chance in here
It's your weakness and your lust, that'll make you a queer
I'm on every tier, with every tear I give
They are not for you, only for God I live
See Allah's God, Muhammed his messenger
May peace be appointed my Lord and master, help me stay up up on 'em 

[Chorus: Bizzy Bone]
Cause I know all about you, I made you hot when you not
And now you talkin fast, actin like you somethin you not
So when I talk about you, can't even remember yo' name
Cause all you playa haters lookin the same, holla back
I know all about you, I made you hot when you not
And now you talkin fast, actin like you somethin you not
So when I talk about you, can't even remember yo' name
Cause every playa hater's lookin the same

[Outro: Bizzy]
One time, Bone Thug nigga</pre>
