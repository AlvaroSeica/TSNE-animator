Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Uh, yeah
Feel the pressure, new semester
Everybody's gettin' fly gotta dress up
And parents pay a lot of money they expect ya
To make a lot of money, so you don't wanna mess up
Now you're stressed huh? Try your best but
Why it never seems enough to impress 'em
And you just wanna hear 'em say "Good job"
Instead of "Get a good job"
So tell me, where is your rest huh?
And parents feel the strain too 'cause they named you
And they got the responsibility to raise you
If you turn out like a demon instead of an angel
Then they be catchin' the blame for bringing the family shame
When kids have kids they run and abandon
Others stick around, model broken examples
Clean ones nobody's hands is in and sometimes
This life's got more questions than answers.

I feel the pressure, yeah, coming from every side
I feel the pressure, yeah, knocked down but I'm still alive
When I feel the pressure, yeah, like where do I run to?
When I feel the pressure, pressure, pressure, pressure

Look
You ever feel like you're wandering?
No aims, no accomplishments,
Life's passing by, gotta make something out of it
And every time the clock tick,
You be so reminded how time flies but you ain't in the cockpit
And birthdays are like the worst days,
There's turmoil in your heart but celebration on the sur-face
'Cause Mondays it's right back to that workplace,
Where you hate it, but you gotta get paid

Yeah I could feel the pressure too, every time I'm speakin
On the microphone, different crowds on the weekends
'Cause I remember what James said about teachin
And why is everybody scrutinizing what I'm Tweetin'
Signed to that Reach camp expectations way
Higher than decent, I became free when I seen God's peace
Rested in it knowing that He's pleased with me
Now I don't gotta please men...

I feel the pressure, yeah, coming from every side
I feel the pressure, yeah, knocked down but I'm still alive
When I feel the pressure, yeah, like where do I run to?
When I feel the pressure, pressure, pressure, pressure

I'm free (I'm free), I'm alive (I'm alive)
Feeling good (feelin' good), alright (alright)
And you can't take my joy
And you can't take my joy

I'm free, I'm alive
Feeling good, alright
And you can't take my joy
('Cause the world didn't give it to me)
And you can't take my joy
('Cause the world didn't give it to me)

I'm free, I'm alive
Feeling good, alright
And you can't take my joy, No!
('Cause the world didn't give it to me)
And you can't take my joy, No!
('Cause the world didn't give it to me)

I'm free, I'm alive
Feeling good, alright
And you can't take my joy, No!
('Cause the world didn't give it to me)
And you can't take my joy, No!
('Cause the world didn't give it to me)

I'm free, I'm alive
Feeling good, alright
And you can't take my joy, No!
('Cause the world didn't give it to me)
And you can't take my joy, No!
('Cause the world didn't give it to me)</pre>
