[Memphis Bleek]
Yeah, what y'all niggas want?
Street shit, Memph Bleek shit, Ja Rule
[Ja Rule]
Ya heard nigga

[Chorus 1: Ja Rule - repeat 2X]
Niggaz live with it money, drugs and murda for life
Bitches deal with it, only lovin' them hoes for the night
If you feelin' it, get high it's all right
But you can't get it 'til the day of my demise

[Memphis Bleek]
Yo, you can holla at the dog
Haters want to see me fall
Bitches want to see me ball
Killers they don't want to see me at all
If I wasn't rolling with the roc
Would you niggaz pass roc, 
Yeah birds, or flash glocks
I walk around with two mac's, razors, and ice picks
Just cause' you niggaz want to see me hurtin' like them
It's all about the benjamins, money, cash, hoes
livin' through this shit I'm in, nigga stack dough
Street scholar, eight-figga nigga, white collar gat
Ain't the M-E-M-P-H man, bitch holla back
I'm a creature smokin' on hate since it was reefer
Drug ass flow, like I've been cuffed with Eta
Mark ass nigga don't want parts of this nigga
Spark with this nigga, blaze bark with this nigga
Me and Ja Rule fuckin' you hoes is what these guys do
Ain't the type to buy you, mommy how are you? 
Slide cock inside you supply you, with ten bitches times two
I'm a motherfucking animal

[Chorus 2: Ja Rule - repeat 2X]
Niggaz live with money, drugs, and murda for life
Bitches deal with it, only lovin' them hoes for the night
If your feelin' get high it's all right
Niggaz can't get it 'til the day of my demise

[Ja Rule]
Fuck, the world cause it ain't quite ready for me
I'm livin' my life niggas take a look at these eyes witness What it's like to 
be real niggaz 
Guns, drugs, hot slugs, coke rugs
Want some, get some, bad enough, pop some, nigga
Fuck around with Ja and may get hit up 
Tearing your whole clique up, then we clip up
Nigga that's what the murder, Nigga that's us
What the fuck? Is you ready to die right now Nigga?
Make you feel my style nigga
Growin' up with wild Brooklon and Queens L niggas
Hit em, any nigga that breathe room reel em wit' hot ones Ain't no nigga like 
me, who you ridin' with?
Rollin' nothing but hot shit, yo' bitch my bitch
Only difference is bitches on my dick, blow dick
How Icock spread it, hoes love that shit
You sel-a-bid I turn you in to the freakyist bitch
Have you topless, dancing in bars naked for dollars
Y'all bitches know how my style is, always in some foul shit
RULE bitch let the world know when I spit 
Nothing but the murderous, live with it

[Chorus 2]

[Memphis Bleek]
Yo, Yo, Yo Holla what you think of that?

Live with it, lick and hit it, don't stop, get it get it

[Ja Rule]
None of me cause' i hit em' with too much style
In my energy, got niggaz creating little me's

Knowing it's my time if I leave and breathe 
Niggaz hatin' on mines I'm a nightmare
