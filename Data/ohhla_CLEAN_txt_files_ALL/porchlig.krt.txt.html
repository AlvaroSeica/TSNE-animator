[Big K.R.I.T.]
Yeah, baby leave the porch light on
Baby leave the porch light on
Baby leave the porch light on
I can feel your pain through the phone
I promise not to stay too long
So leave the porch light on

I gotta get it while the getting good, get outside the hood
I'm tired of the landlord tripping on us
My partner said he got a play, heard it worked the other day
I'll been home late because I'm bending corners
Don't worry, hit me via text, ain't no need to stress
Gotta make some moves, I hate to leave you home lonely
I know just how it be when you in between the sheets
While I'm in the streets, think I need to feel homely
Lord knows I'm out chere on the grind
Maybe one day we can shine, ain't no telling when I'm coming home
Remember that you said that pussy mine, any time
Well meet me at the door with no panties on
And don't be mad, playing hard to get
cause you could cum till your heart content
Yeah, I can feel your pain through the phone
I promise not to stay too long, so leave the porch light on

[Chorus: Anthony Hamilton]
I'm coming home, baby it won't be long
I know you looking fine, slide up behind ya
Say something good to you, it won't be long
I'm coming home, coming home nice and strong
I wanna see them eyes when I surprise ya
I promise I won't stay too long, so leave the porch light on

[Big K.R.I.T.]
Back out on the road again
Different city, in the studio working on the flow again
I really want to talk on the phone
But shawty I gotta finish this song, it won't be long
until we presidential suite, vaca'ing on the beach, Waikiki'ing for a week
Diamond in the back, leather on the seats
Louie on your frame, red bottoms on your feet
I mean the money can't change how you feel right now
Even harder cause you bother once the sun goes down
Wondering where I'm going after shows and such
Don't be listening to your friends cause they talk too much
They don't know just what we going through to make it right
I pray you understand this ain't overnight
I'll be on the next flight on my way back home
I promise I won't stay too long, so leave the porch light on

[Chorus]

[Anthony Hamilton] + (Big K.R.I.T.)
I won't take too long baby
I'm on my way baby (baby leave the porch light on)
Coming home
I wanna love you, oh-oh-ohhh (baby leave the porch light on)
You know I'm on my way (baby leave the porch light on)
I can't stay away too long
Yeahhh

[Chorus]

[Anthony Hamilton]
I won't wait too long baby
Why don't you go on and flick that light on?
Now won't ya see me stepping up to the door
when I'm getting closer, closer baby, yeah</pre>
