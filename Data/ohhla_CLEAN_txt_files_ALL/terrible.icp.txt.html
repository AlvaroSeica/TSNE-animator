MOTHERFUCKER! YOU DON'T KNOW SHIT, DO YOU?
YOU WOULDN'T KNOW SHIT IF IT WHIP KICKED YOU
IN YOUR UGLY BITCH-ASS FACE.
YOU AIN'T EVEN BEGUN TO EXPERIENCE DRAMA, MOTHERFUCKER.
YOUR MAMMA,
YOUR MOTHERFUCKING BIG FAT CHICKEN FACE ASS MAMMA,
DONT EVEN KNOW ABOUT THIS DRAMA, MOTHERFUCKER!

(1st Verse- Violent J)
Oh my god! look at that turn it up please
Poor Nancy Kerrigan's sweet little knees
Somebody took a black thing and went thump
That's TEEERRRIBlE!  We heard about it for months
What about that one nobody guy that they found?
Dead in the grass with his, dick in his ass
Plus there was more but you won't recall
Because Micheal Jackson squeezed up on some little kids balls
What you consider...DRAMA
Ain't all that, it's just that you're wack
with your intergalatic satellite data compress
But we can't feed the homeless
Then OJ's wack story unfolded
And everybody watched that while Oklahoma exploded
900 good reasons why this world really don't care
THAT'S WHEN IT CALLS FOR A WHEELCHAIR!

(Chorus- Violent J)
What you know 'bout terrible?
[YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT'S TERRIBLE] (x2)

Yeah she's so terrible you gotta beat her you BITCH-ASS WACK MOTHERFUCKER!

(2nd Verse- Shaggy2Dope)
LOOOORRDY-lord have we got a protest, man
Some rock-and-roll ninja bit the head off a bat
Was watching his concert, and channeled to hell
'Cuz he's so fucking TEERRRIBLE
Meanwhile his records sell double and triple
'Cuz of you crying about him rubbing his nipple
Religious? Shit, you helped them bang
Instead of helping them poor people eating out of them garbage cans
When you're done with them bitch, come protest me
Shit, motherfucker I could use some money
The whole world was crying when Kurt's gun went BANG!
When Eazy-E died though, it wasn't no thang
Rapper dies of A.I.D.S. but you hardly mention
Rocker blows his face off and becomes a legend
Everyone grab a shotgun, a hero is made
Maybe I should do that shit so J can get paid

(Chorus)

Are your kids so terrible you gotta beat on them too 
YOU DRUNK MOTHERFUCKER!!

[Rebel Flag] In your schools
[Rebel Flag] In your parks
[Rebel Flag] In your courtrooms
[Rebel Flag] In your hearts
[Rebel Flag] Stood for slavery
[Rebel Flag] Stood for war
[Rebel Flag] Stood for hatred 
             but just go ahead and hang your flag up some more!
[Don't worry about my goddamn flag boy 
 what's terrible is you damn rappers cursin']

(3rd Verse- Shaggy2Dope)
The country we live in was biult by slaves
Beat down and murdered and stuffed in their graves
You put a slave owner on the one dollar bill
And you wanna know why I KILLLL PEOPLE!
(Violent J)
Bombs are blowing up, cops are corrupt
And all you care about is who the president fucked?
You don't know terrible...you will
as soon as our wagons come over the hill!!

(Chorus repeats to end)</pre>
