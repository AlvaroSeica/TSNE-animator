[Intro: Tony Montana]
In this country, you gotta make the money first
Then you get the money, you get the power
Then you get the power, then you get the women

[Chorus: x2]
Shoe box, no shoes in em (no shoes in em)
Shoe box, no shoes in em
You hear that money machine, you hear that money machine
You hear that money machine, you hear that money machine

[Verse 1]
I've been getting to the money all week
5 shoulders, 7 days, hit the mall it's on me
Shoe boxes in my closet, but I ain't got no shoes in them
Fill em up with money till it don't have no more room in them
501 Levi's, fresh in my new Denim
Kick bitch with me, skinnies on her, she can't move in them
Call me your highness, or better yet the fliest motherfucker that you seen in a while
You can't deny it, I got a bright future, I can see it like a psychic
And if I see it and I like it, then I buy it
Yeah, I live a cash money lifestyle, haters die slow
It's young money but I'm counting old money on the floor
From my shoe box

[Chorus: x2]
Shoe box, no shoes in em (no shoes in em)
Shoe box, no shoes in em
You hear that money machine, you hear that money machine
You hear that money machine, you hear that money machine

[Verse 2]
I'm getting money, I'm in the fast lane
Got a million bitches following my campaign
I don't drink champagne, I just sip lean
Had a big red, now I'm movin like a centipede
The purple potion got me moving slow motion nigga
Like Juvenile and Soldier Slim, shout out to Nolia nigga
New Orleans till I die, east side boy
I been chasing paper since I was a knee high, boy
So getting money is the mission
They say that money talks, so you should listen while I'm spitting
And all I know is hustle, I ain't got time to be slackin
Uncle Sam done locked me up for what I got stuffed up in my mattress
In my shoe box

[Chorus: x2]
Shoe box, no shoes in em (no shoes in em)
Shoe box, no shoes in em
You hear that money machine, you hear that money machine
You hear that money machine, you hear that money machine

No shoes in em
You hear that money machine, you hear that money machine
You hear that money machine, you hear that money machine</pre>
