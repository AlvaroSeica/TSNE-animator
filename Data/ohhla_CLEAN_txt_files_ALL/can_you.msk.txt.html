Song:   Can You Forgive Me
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
Can you forgive me
I look back at everything
That we've been thru
And I know that I no longer deserve you
Can you find a little bit of compassion
Let me show you girl I really love you.

[Verse 1]
What does she have that I didn't
I wish you would tell me
I know this is over but
I'd really like to know before I fall asleep
I've had my phone ready to call you
But I held back because I'm weak
I know that if I hear your voice
It's gonna hurt me so I tryna keep away
So I wont let my heart disturb me but its hard
I never hurt this much for anybody
So when I think of calling you
It hurts to picture me and you..

[Hook]
Que paso todo el tiempo me mentiste
Tu y yo forever estariamos siempre
Y ahora triste estoy me quebraste el corazon

[Verse 2]
Me quebraste el corazon carino
Now I'm writing this letter
I hope you understand the feelings
Behind every letter everyword I write
I swear I feel it from the bottom
Of my broken heart and the feeling
That I'm dying cause you torn myself apart

[Chorus]
Can you forgive me
I look back at everything
That we've been thru
And I know that I no longer deserve you
Can you find a little bit of compassion
Let me show you girl I really love you..

[Verse 3]
I really love you please mama let me explain
I would do whatever to take away the pain
I hope that you can look inside your memories and find
That I was right there for you thru the darkest times
Lo ke tubimos momentos compartidos
Yo soy el ke te kiere baby nunca el enemigo
I put this on whatever baby even on my life
Ur the best thing that I've ever had I realize
Por eso mismo yo te ruego con todito el corazon
Nunca mas te fallo mi palabra te la doy
I blame it on stupidity I lost my mind
Because a girl like you I know that I would never find
I wanna build the trust once again
I wanna show you babygirl I'm still your bestfriend
Yo te necesito abre el corazon
Porque yo me estoy muriendo sin tu amor ....

[Chorus]
Can you forgive me
I look back at everything
That we've been thru
And I know that I no longer deserve you
Can you find a little bit of compassion
Let me show you girl I really love you..

[Verse 4]
I had to take a lil second my blury vision
But the tears keep on falling on every paper
And I'm tryna hold on the best way that I can
But the thought of losing you isn't understand
My stomach hurts I feel betrayed I need you back into my life
Me desespero cause I really want you back
And every second that is passing I lose you more
I wanna text you but I cant cause you don't love me anymore
I don't wanna let go let go of the past
Cause this is all I got from you and I ain't giving it back
No way no how I ain't giving it backi know it hurts
But I rather hurt than lose it all
I rather be unhappily than lose it all carino
And forget bout you and me and the next time
That I see you if I see you once again
Ill let you know the way I feel so maybe
Ull undestand mi amor por ti</pre>
