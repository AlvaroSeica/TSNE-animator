[Chorus: Snoop Lion &amp; Jahdan Blakkamoore]
Look at hard mama work just tryin to get by (HEY YEAH!)
And enough ghetto yutes out there still a nuh get nuh bligh (HEY! HEY!)
Just keep on di hustle 'cause we have to stay pon di grind (HEY-HEY! YEAH!)
Don't give up on your dreams 'cause you know di sun will shine
Di sun will shine

[Verse One: Snoop Lion]
Up early in the mornin 'til late at night
Seein mama scrapin for nickels and dimes
On the salary she's makin we can barely survive
Tell me is there something greater in this life
Wait! Said mama!
Patience and honor
Breakin down, is not an option
Make it happen my son

[Chorus: Snoop Lion &amp; Jahdan Blakkamoore]
Look at hard mama work just tryin to get by (HEY YEAH!)
And enough ghetto yutes out there still a nuh get nuh bligh (HEY! HEY!)
Just keep on di hustle 'cause we have to stay pon di grind (HEY-HEY! YEAH!)
Don't give up on your dreams 'cause you know di sun will shine
Di sun will shine

[Verse Two: Snnop Lion]
How much more can my mama take?!
Now I gotta step up to the plate
Can't afford to make mistakes
Ain't no time to wait
Wait! Said mama!
Patience and honor
Breakin down, is not an option
Make it happen somehow

[Chorus: Snoop Lion &amp; Jahdan Blakkamoore]
Look at hard mama work just tryin to get by (HEY YEAH!)
And enough ghetto yutes out there still a nuh get nuh bligh (HEY! HEY!)
Just keep on di hustle 'cause we have to stay pon di grind (HEY-HEY! YEAH!)
Don't give up on your dreams 'cause you know di sun will shine
Di sun will shine

[Verse Three: Jahdan Blakkamoore]
To how di system a mek it so hard
From California straight to New York
From Chicago gone straight dung a yard
People everywhere dem haffi work and a strive
Cyaan get a visa fi fly ova di bordaline
Everywhere I go dem facin much harda times
Mi know di grass go green deh pon di odda side
But mi still waan see weh mi can find
HEYYYYY!!!!!

[Chorus: Snoop Lion &amp; Jahdan Blakkamoore]
Look at hard mama work just tryin to get by (HEY YEAH!)
And enough ghetto yutes out there still a nuh get nuh bligh (HEY! HEY!)
Just keep on di hustle 'cause we have to stay pon di grind (HEY-HEY! YEAH!)
Don't give up on your dreams 'cause you know di sun will shine
Di sun will shine
Look at hard mama work just tryin to get by (HEY YEAH!)
And enough ghetto yutes out there still a nuh get nuh bligh (HEY! HEY!)
Just keep on di hustle 'cause we have to stay pon di grind (HEY-HEY! YEAH!)
Don't give up on your dreams 'cause you know di sun will shine
