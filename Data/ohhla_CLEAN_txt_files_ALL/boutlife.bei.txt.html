Song:   Bout That Life
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Hey Shawty..
It's a Bei Maejor thang

[Chorus x2]
She say she really bout that life
Party every night
Ahhh, Ahhh, Ahhh, Ahh
She say she really bout that life
Party every night
Ahhh, Ahhh, Ahhh, Ah

You ain't bout that life, no
You ain't bout that life, yo
You ain't bout that life, nahhh nahh
I say we be bout that life, yo
We be bout that life, yo
We be bout that life
Ahhh Ahhh Ahhh

[Verse 1]
I'm body body no limits
I got money on money
I got haters on haters
But I got women that love me
I got a list full of problems
Prolly tend to 'em later
My whole team is some rages
And we go off like a racist
And I got chips I'm a blow
Bout that life I ain't fake'n
I got rims on the car
Whi-Whi-Whipped like I'm bacon
Leave yo fear at the door
We go hard or go home
I say we major, we on
We go-go-go til it's gone

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 2]
I got no time for games
cause I'm just too busy winning
I got no time to save
cause I'm just too busy spending
We just so young and so reckless
Carry ons, never check it
And they can't beat us, they join us
Ay look I gotta respect it
I went from nothing to something
Went from pennies to millions
We use to chill on the porch
but now we up in the building
And if you bought it, we bought it
We still out when you not
If I don't make it tonight
at least I went out on top

[Chorus x3]</pre>
