[Intro: Chuck D]
Ohhhhh! ohh! this is Ice Cube's message
From you to you, tell them Cube
You better, check it out!
In this time, we go coast to coast, rhyme with rhyme
Mic-mic-microphone check -----&gt; Ice Cube
Come On! check it now --------&gt; Flavor Flav
That's right, now with no further due
Yo Cube, tell them what they got to do!

[Verse One: Ice Cube]
You better check yourself before you wreck yourself
Cause I'm bad for your health, I come real stealth
Dropping bombs on your moms, kill car alarms
Do a foul crime, I'm that nigga with the Alpine
Sold it for a six-o, always let tricks know
And friends know, we got the Indo
No I'm not a sucker, sitting in a House of Pain
And no I'm not the butler, I'll cut ya (Uh!)
Headbutt ya, you say you can't touch this
And I wouldn't touch ya, punk motherfucker!
Here to let you know boy, oh boy
I make dough, but don't call me DoughBoy
This ain't no fucking motion picture
A guy or bitch-a, I'll get with ya
And hit ya, taking that yack to the neck
So you better run a check

[Chorus: Ice Cube]
Chickitty check yourself, before you wreck yourself
Chickitty check yourself, before you wreck yourself
Chickitty check yourself, before you wreck yourself
Cause shotgun bullets are bad for your health

[Interlude #1: Chuck D]
Mic-mic-microphone check.. One, two!
Mic-mic-microphone check.. One, two!
Mic-mic-microphone check.. What you're gonna do?
Mic-mic-microphone check.. Come On Cube!

[Verse Two: Ice Cube]
Tricks wanna step to Cube and then they get played
Cause they're Bitch Made, pulling out a Switchblade
That's kind of trifle, caise that's a knife-o
AK-47, assault rifle
Hold the fifty, I'm nifty, pow
Got a new style, "WATCH OUT NOW!"
I hate motherfuckers, claiming that they folding bank
But steady talking shit in the holding tank
First you wanna step to me
Now your ass screaming for the deputy
They send you to Charlie, Baker Denver row
Now they're running up in you slow
You're gone, used to be the Don Juan
Now your name is just Twan
Switching, snapping, rolling your eyes and neck
You better run a check

[Chorus: Ice Cube]
Chickitty check yourself, before you wreck yourself
Chickitty check yourself, before you wreck yourself
Chickitty check yourself, before you wreck yourself
Cause shotgun bullets are bad for your health

[Interlude #2: Chuck D]
Mic-mic-microphone check.. One, two, One, two!
Mic-mic-microphone check.. One, two, One, two!
Mic-mic-microphone check.. One, two!
Mic-mic-microphone check.. Cube what you wanna do?

[Verse Three: Ice Cube]
If you're foul, you better run a make on that license plate
You could've had a V8
Instead of a tre-eight slug to the cranium (POOOOOW!)
I got six and I'm aiming them (YEAH!!)
Will I shoot or keep you guessing?
Cause fuck you and that shit you stressing
Bitch, get off the wood, you're no good
There goes the neighbourhood rat (there they go!)
Go ahead and keep your drawers
Giving up the claps and who needs applause
At a time like this, pop the coochie and you dead
The bitch is a Miami Hurricane head
Sprung, niggaz call her 'Lips and Lungs'
Nappy dugout, get the fuck out!
Cause bitches like you gets no respect
Bitch, you better run a check

[Chorus: Ice Cube]
Chickitty check yourself, before you wreck yourself
Chickitty check yourself, before you wreck yourself
Chickitty check yourself, before you wreck yourself
Cause bitches like you bullets is bad for my health

[Interlude #3: Chuck D]
Mic-mic-microphone check.. One, two!
Mic-mic-microphone check.. One, two!
Mic-mic-microphone check.. What you wanna do?
Mic-mic-microphone check.. Westside baby, UHH!
COME ON!! ~ you better.. you better..
Check yourself Cube!.. Check yourself Cube!</pre>
