Genabis
This is Genabis, Remember this

[Canibus]
In the beginning I discovered wordplay
I experimented with some syllables from the first to the third day
On the fourth I searched for the words to say
How to compress complex verbiage in the least amount of space
I was perfect at it and mastered the tactic's
On the fifth day I decided I would combine it with mathematics
On the sixth day I became a fanatic and I couldnt kick the habit
I would just look in the mirror and practice
On the seventh cycle, I had to take the day off
I was exhausted I guessed my work will never pay off
But if it happened it to him, it could happen to me
And if it happened to me, it was destined to be

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Yo, Genabis, Exobus, Levitibus
There aint a mic on this planet I'm restricted to touch
I read the cosmo's but God wrote predicted as much
The inhabitants lack faith but resistance is tough

[Canibus]
They backslide back to church and call a minister's bluff
They rather remain unenlightened then listen to Bus
I blew the fuck up, even though it was short and abrupt
I was the first rapper to ever to close orbit the sun
One small step for man, one huge step for mankind
...I am the red giant of rhymes
Solar deflectors, incinerate you whole in a second
Flow is untested those that I've threatened fold under pressure
At 120 Beta cycles, high volts ignite your eyeballs
Until you see the fire in front of you
Optic cone rods, melt one at a time till you realize you in hell
Rip the Jacker's not done with you
I terrorize the rap community with impunity
Blow you to pieces and move elusively thru the debris
What my enemies want to do to me is old news to me
Those that pursue to me will never get thru to me

[Chorus]

[Canibus]
First rapper to speak over beats dogmatically
Mixed with Elizabethian drama and tragedy
My motto is to dress casually and live lavishly
Look at the Victorian tapestry in back of me
Notice the post renaissance pictures I drew
Hand sketched drawings of the deserts in Nazca Peru
The followable audio propogates the possible truth
For proof I'm the illest so the choice is not unto you
See the standard ideological definition of a rap model
Its Canibus scholarly periodicals
The article is substantially impressive, more then a message
A working thesis from several different perspectives
The Rosetta stone of sentences
For rap music's tentative
Enter apprentices
This is Genabis
The Rosetta stone of sentences
For rap music's tentative
Enter apprentices
This is Genabis
