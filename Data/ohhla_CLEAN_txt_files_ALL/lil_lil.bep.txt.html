[Intro]
Get on up and (get down)
People in the place just (...a blunt)
Get down rock with (the Peas)
The BEP crew and (...a bud)

[Verse 1]
People get prepared cause we droppin it
Motivating everybody when we rocking it
But for envious they ain't the ???
Cause they actin all jealous and sensitive
Cause it get and we tell it we the displayin ears
Certified and be the ish when its way in in
Plus its too damn heavy for you to carry thing
(Who get shocked ?)
Shocked by my curent air
People in the place that dig it and realate
(They like it)
When we vision and displace
(They love it)
When we switchin up the pace
(Cause they need it
Cause they turn them on
They want in)
So I'ma hit 'em with the fit
Cause we deliverin the ol' cosmic shit
Combined with elements from 1986 and
And bindin' 'em with intergalactic tricks
Look chick the result be the Peas
Ain't will and ain't no ever entity to bring the breeze
Winds that pull you in like tornados and we better might to let you know
Cause I..

[Chorus]
Give a lil' lil'
You take a lil' lil'
Lets have a lil' lil'
And make a lil' lil'
I love
Cause we can
I..
Give a lil' lil'
You take a lil' lil'
Lets have a lil' lil'
And shake a lil' lil'
We dance
Cause we can

[Verse 2]
It's necesary for me to be acurate
Get exactly angle plus imaculate
Letin everybody know that we droppin it
Where we step up to the place ain't no stopin it
Cause I'ma hit you lovely with my HIP
Make you dance to my Hop fanaticly
Pornograficly we bring it to you musicly
Hit you haked mentaly uncontrolably

Master to hit you right down till you shiver
Give you butterflys in you stomach and uplift ya
The legendary sound of redue
The transseder sendin this out to you
Cause I

Lets have a lil' lil'
And make a lil' lil'
We love..
