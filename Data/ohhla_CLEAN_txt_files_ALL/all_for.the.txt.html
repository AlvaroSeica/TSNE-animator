YEAH
Its Real life right here man
Talk to Em

[Verse 1: Clyde Carson]
Aye
It all started with a group from the west called APG
Big cousin redd turn me on to the beat
First year of the 90's I just turned nine
A Hoop dream Nigga never had a plan around
But I guess this rap shit was my callin
Caugh after high school I was through wit ballin
Try to rap with Redd but he was stallin
Met with onethang shit started to fall in
A cool nigga with a nice lil sound
Hook up with chillipowder
He broke the shit down
Gave me the game up on the rap game
And Games been connect its on to do my thang
The first album worth shit every single hot
Move up to new York Got my style a flavor
Came back A new man New Flow with a new plan
To shake the bay up and rep for OAKLAND

[Hook]
I took falls with my team
I got endorsed with my team
I did it all with my team
So its only right I roll with my team
I took falls with my team
I got endorsed with my team
I did it all with my team
So its only right I roll with my team
Nigga

[Verse 2: Maine Mannish]
I remember how it all begun
Seventeen years young
Not in highschool rollin the jungle
Rap didnt make me none
Had dreams of crack schemes
About clean shit was dumb but(You hella stupid man)
we Connected with Carson
Hopin on talkin about the path we walked in
We chose to rap right
Thought it would come quick
Thought about the money and
The hoes and the black 6
Thought it was easy-turned out greasy
Freak on the leave in the story of glassy
Had to relax sit back think about the whole situation
Loss of ovation man communication
Picture years now I'm cast out on probation
Plus I'm back to the bay now back to the bases
Grew from a story lead Beyond the Glory
Bringin fresh water got these niggaz low from it(yeah)

[Hook]
I took falls with my team
I got endorsed with my team
I did it all with my team
So its only right I roll with my team
I took falls with my team
I got endorsed with my team
I did it all with my team
So its only right I roll with my team

[Verse 3: Kaz Kizah]
There'll be none before none after
Niggaz know my page And chose my chapter
Got my first pistol I'm cockin handles
After looked up  become and came a cocky bastard
the 9-7-9-8 I'm joe montana
til ninety had me got locked in the slamma
Moms use to say More than to come
First round draft pick dawg I'm more like Lebron
More of a don You know the place is capin
Neva hit Penn state only the state pen
now I take pens comprehend what I rise
Lil niggaz just live never live my life
We rappin never imagined
Closed Traptin
Now every track I'm on Kaz attractin
Clydes pass See when my lil nigga laughin
Undastand what my past this is what Kaz is

[Hook]
I took falls with my team
I got endorsed with my team
I did it all with my team
So its only right I roll with my team
I took falls with my team
I got endorsed with my team
I did it all with my team
So its only right I roll with my team</pre>
