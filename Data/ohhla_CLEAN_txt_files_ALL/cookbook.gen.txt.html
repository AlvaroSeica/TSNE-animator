Genelec
Memphis Reigns...
Clarity of a Terrorist.
Presidential.
 
Genelec:
 
I exist as an independent entity, governments possess no knowledge of this identity
Operation Power Chancer
Under investigation for the distribution of treasonous propaganda
By Nary 80 and Steel Panther
Seven continents my feet have roamed
Instantly command everyone of them, overthrow
Rebel activity's unknown, during massive electricity overload
I snuck into the hanger to download various march codes
Two weeks later the challenger exposed
You didn't know about the NATO senate chamber?
I rearranged the data on the motherfuckin label translaters
Chaos creater, trained in criminology, geology and neural psychology
Interceptin' chinese technologies to leave Russian satellites blocked
Penetrated fort knox like it was guarded by luggage mocks
Then target the leaders in North Korea
Took the fuckin twilight camp to the Mona Lisa
Abused for World War III, proceed to sparkin'
Crashing American Stock Markets
Leave the whole world in disarray
By sending virus form: The Y2K
 
*DJing*
 
Memphis Reigns:
 
Yo, I dont quit when im ahead
Stop when I say so, crews who get their peace like kids who're playing lego's
Super Agents who fly skys i play the lay low
Wanted internationally like Carmon SanDiego.
Master of disguise change face at any pace
Rendevouz at any place, no existence of my state
Renegades are paged crew stations and databases 
Mortal hostile surrender are more than navy bases
United Nations know solutions to the infiltrations
Wanted by the Federal Bureau, of Investigation
Patient with the force proceed i sign and crush ya
Advanced technological armor stolen from Russia
Super diabolical seeds a planet needs mutated by scientifical labs and Japanese..
For the purpose: Undercover, no sight of what im seeing
X-files delete, for the defeating of European's
Identity erased
Unknown discovered weaponry
Blowin' up the SPOTS like heads on John Kennedy....
 
*airplane engine*
 
"Let every nation know!"</pre>
