[Sick Jacken]
Street kid royalty, Kings cause of loyalty
Don't rat, don't die, reap what the spoils be
Hopin that the cops and the feds keep ignorin me
If they ask questions you can bet that's where my lawyer be
Small minds checkmate, the pigs tryin to get him and arrest hate
Pharmaceuticals to get my head straight
My mind open, psycho when I put the coke in
That's why I sound a little strange when my words are spoken
Laws are broken by the token crime often
Nine times out of dimes rap chimed with the square motion
And so the game's changed, from shooting range
to shooting kites to feds to paperwork that's full of names
That's why I'm on a solo tip
Cause the one-sided gun don't flip, that's just my new shit
Though the concept of my crimey is behind me
You can still find me, in the presence of a sick army

[Chorus: various samples]
{"Do I gotta play the role just to be liked?"}
{"Get yours, I'mma get mine"}
{"That's why I write the shit I write in my raps"}
{"You know how we think - I'ma get, mine"}
{"Rap, hip-hop, underground, mainstream"}
{"Get yours, I'ma get mine"}
{"That's why I write the shit I write my raps"}
{"You know how we think - I'ma get, mine"}

[Slaine]
I paint a picture of the streets, her-on fiends and thieves
With rotted teeth in the alleys when they spotted police
I'm the rowdy cry of addiction and the voice of despair
Like the hope that burns inside 'em put the noise in his ear
Like beside him full of poison with his boys out of lock up
Ridin beside him, riding and dyin hard in the iron
I'm the poster child for white America gone wrong
Before you figure me out, I'm long gone
They call me Slaine cause I speak through the dyin eyes of a wise soul
that cries cold through each story that I've told
Crafted in my fabric, I'm not just rappin to music
Apparently what's happened: I have captured a movement
Splashin the absolute juice through intrusive truths
I'm the old fashioned new sense of a nuisance's noose
They're callin out for help from the heart of the youthless youth
That's what happens when you stop just doin you for you

[Chorus]

[Sabac Red]
I'm all about the people and progression, porn flicks and politics
A lot of it's ironic, got a long list of followers
with silencers attached, they shoot up the house
It's pure chaos like the cover of "The Future Is Now"
My goons move in a crowd, keep it under control
then BP your bitch, feed her things and plug up her holes
At my shows grown folks throw they sets in the air
I've been with fans smoke boges, drink Mexican beer
Al-Jahir, Al-Jihad, do you believe in the God?
I'm aware I stand somewhere between the seas and the stars
Police in their cars, playin games of evens and odds
and creepin the yard, now you leavin bleedin with scars
I speak these bars to escape it, fuck the fake shit I hate it
I wanna shapeshift that Diggin In The Crate shit
My patience and kindness turned hatred to violence
I pray for the day we read sacred environments
