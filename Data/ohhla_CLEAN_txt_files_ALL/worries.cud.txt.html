[1st Verse - Kid CuDi]
Yeah, the crazy the wizard
So much whiskey all in my liver
I really like the punch it delivers
Makes me warm while I high five sinners
All alone, trying to hide from the shadows
Aint no use, it seems everywhere they follow
They know where I be at
In my mind tryna get me

[Chorus - Mary J. Blige &amp; Kid CuDi]
These worries are heavy, they rest on my shoulders
My body wont let me fall victim no more
These worries are heavy, they rest on my shoulders
My body wont let me fall victim no more

[Hook - Kid CuDi]
Life is like that
Beat me up and Ill fight right back
Poof poof - be gone 
I see the devil linger on
Yeah,  stuck in my hell 
Writing my mom and I aint doing so well
Lord let me in
I feel like hes my only friend

[2nd Verse - Kid CuDi]
Yeah, the rage of the menace
Hate me now then hate me when Im winning
Work so hard to not go insane
Its a full time job to not lose my faith
Okay, Ive been here before 
Alone for the upteenth time or more
Im tired of motherfuckers sayin' that they worry about me
When in fact they probably never gave a fuck about me

[Chorus]

[Hook - Mary J. Blige]
Yeah, life is like that 
Beat me up and Im fighting right back
Poof poof - be gone 
I see the devil linger on
Yeah, I wanna win
As long as I can do the work within' 
Lord help me in,
I feel like your my only friend

[Chorus]

[Kid CuDi]
Yeah
The rage of the menace..</pre>
