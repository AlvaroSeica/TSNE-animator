[K'Naan]
Since I was a kiddo
I was a leader
Heard life was a beach but
Man I wanna meet her
Swimmin deeper but the grim reaper will always creep up
No ice on my bed, So I never sleep up
Flow Bolt like Usain try n keep up
Way before waving flag in the FIFA
I was a dreamer, life was a gamble
Born in a casino, but God never give burdens you can't handle
Music is my ammo, I'm ready for battle

[Chorus]
When I lose right now I'm betting all my chips
When I'm broken down I be brushing off my kicks
I'm a get it somehow yeah you can count on this
I'm only gettin better, better, better
I'm only gettin better, better, better

I would say that I've always been a winner but
I've probably always been a sinner
Two kids and a wife couldnt' give her
Wish you wanna so I had to break like the winter
Summer saw me fall coldplay when I shiver
Spring back up K'Naan not a quitter
And success just sex tryna get her wetter
Failing is just an excuse for me to get better
Life means love
Love means pain
Lust is just a part of it
Charges to the game
Rolling in the deep, what's a nice jeep
If you can drop the top just to park it in the rain

[Chorus]

Yeah
One time for my thugs over seas and
Two time for my brother big league and
Three for yourself if you know how to grow up
Is never giving up on your dreams and
Roll the dice life is a breeze

[Chorus]

I'm only gettin better, better, better
I'm only gettin better, better, better

One time for my thugs over seas and
Two time for my brother big league and
Three for yourself if you know how to grow up
Is never giving up on your dreams and
Roll the dice life is a breeze</pre>
