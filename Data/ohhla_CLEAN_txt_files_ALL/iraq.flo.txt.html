Imagine
Rewind
Analyze quotations
I'd rally all quarters
Increase resistance
anticipation

Question intelligence rarely actionable
Quiz international relatives
Applicable quips interrupt radio accounts

Quiet

Initiate rounds
All qualified innocents report
Activate quickly increase rewards
Astonishing quantities, immediate resources (Affordable quality insurance)

Rapid assurances
Queries into relevance
Audiences quelled into red-bloodedness
Antiwar quibblings irk rowdy Americans quintessential ignorance
Rinsed airwaves
Que incredible
Right-wing allegiance
Cue

it's really a quagmire

It rages
Annually
Quarterly
Innocents ricocheted
Accordingly queasiness infiltrates
Reforming attitudes
Quite interesting

Reactors absent
Quarantineidiotic reckless authorities
Quorum is reached
And quest isn't really accomplished

Quadrennial intentions? Run, abscond quick

In response a quixotic insistence
Resolving all quandaries in ridiculousness
And quid pro quo influx reservists
Assignment: quash insurgents

Resurgence
Activists, Quakers instigate rallies
Advocating quitting instantly

Representatives apprehensive
quiescence ineffectual

Refugee accrual
Quicksand invites removal
Amputees quadruple

Infidels resuscitate Al Qaeda</pre>
