Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

	We bigger than the Jews..
	bigger than the Irish..
	you can run the whole fuckin country!
	YOU could be the next John D. Rockerfeller

	"Nobody noticed us, nobody gave a shit..
	 but the bigger we get, 
	 the more we're TAKING from other people.."

[Nas]
Yo, in a mahogany, black scenery
that was lightning and rain drops
I'm tied up in the basement cocaine spot like Bangkok
I'm blindfold, Vietnam type mind control this torture
His accent sounds like the rarest culture
Askin me, my atrophy stabbin me gradually
Says his attribute, was satanic, masonic, ironic
I felt reminded of my fast life ventures
and winters, blinded til the flashlight enters

[AZ]
Yo Dunm, before the sun set
Call connect get all the tech's
I'm vexed, this nigga stall for sex
Lost respect, let's off his neck
My calibre, got me thinkin on a higher algebra
See me I'm just as foul as ya
but you ain't got no style in ya
I'm into bigger cheddar, G's and better, Armarett-ah's
Armani sweaters, plus these crabs could never dead us

Chorus: AZ (repeat 2X)

Mo money, mo murder, mo homicide
You catch that body nigga, better have that alibi
You never know it might just be yo' time you take yo' ride
to them pearly white gates, (now) watch that suicide

[AZ]
Now government official
Got you sippin Cristal in crystal
You fish you foul so you fell and took your fam witchu
I'm out to get you, guaranteed every shell'll hit you
Plus I'm on some shit too
Layin down whose-ever witchu
Mafioso, the New York City 90's era Sosa
AZ, you know my culture
Now my wolves is out to ghost ya

[Nas]
Scent of a rose on the graveyard for real now
The stakes is up a half a mil now
I tried to grab him with his shield down
Four walked in, they're crazy paid up
Sharp but straight up
Gators from Barbados, never seen nobody play those
Lay-Low's what they called him, his head baldin
Sippin cappucino, spilled on his silk suits, was scaldin
Laugh was vulgar, canvas paintings of the Isatollah
And on his arm he wore a priceless vulture
Tobacco pipe smoker, Escobar your life is over
Justify the righteous nova
Bullets flew out his right shoulder
Corpse leavin a foul odor, The Firm Volume 1 adjourned
Bring it to a closure

Chorus

[Nas]
So now you're rollin wit us, 
like co-defendents, no phony business
So know the difference - from supreme solo 
it's the styles ancient as Moses scriptures
It's Latin Kings, Black Kufis, and White Jesters
amongst us
Crime invades the minds of youngsters
Where it's pitch black they can't see you
Godfather 3, fallin for dead, in a cathedral

[AZ]
Now you're forced to listen
I got the mind of a grad from Princeton
Play your position, or soon you'll be lost and missin
It's far from fiction
My presence is like that of a christian
With ammunition puttin states under submission
Street addiction, got me tied in thorough with buroughs
Still in the ghetto, but in the cut where it's mellow
Incognito, on the lee-low, like Carlito
Cause we know, niggaz don't really want us to see doe
You never know it might just be yo' time you take yo' ride
to them pearly white gates, watch that suicide

Chorus 2X

[Nas]
Homicide, mo homicide
Mo suicide, mo homicide..

{*music fades*}
{*untitled 1:18 length song starts*}

Born alone, die alone.. {repeat 4X}

[AZ]
All alone in this wilderness
Who can figure life as ill as this?
My vision's blurred from guerilla's mist
Gun sprays, trey's left a portion of my crew in graves
Niggaz that would screw in ways unknown to these dudes today
Intelligence, kept us all away from state evidence
cause it's evident, this world is controlled on dead presidents
Never hesitant, I'm soulless, filled with coldness
Born to uphold this til I'm left dead from oldness

Born alone, die alone.. {repeat 6X to fade}</pre>
