[Chorus](2x)
No surrender no retreat
Niggaz don't play in the streets
Every day catch me on the block
Nowhere to run, nowhere to go to noooow

[Kool Chuck]
I'm ready now, givin' these rappers lyrical shakedown
When we get it on, you get scuffed up and torn
I make you wish you was never born
These niggaz like to talk that shit
They be burnin' with the devil if they fuck with this
We pop Crys' and we ain't even out yet
And we can fuck yo bitch
I'm all about the money, see I don't fuck
But a lot of niggaz, you know, niggaz get funny
But I'm the type that set you up
Dub, take you up now watch your girl get fucked
Bud is comin' backed up
You can be the MC, whoever
And I don't give a fuck
It's Chuck nigga, don't disregard the Kool
Or you'll be swimmin' in the blood pool
The most of mine niggaz has gone shoo'
Am you a buncha niggaz wildin' in the zoo
I been nice for years, you niggaz is played
I get late gear, still in fear

[Chorus](2x)

[Diamond (D)]
Yeah to my nigga A.G
What it feels like, what it feels like
Yo, yo, yo, yo
I seen you in the club about to smack the ho out you now
Frontin' at the bar, like you really know how to wild
I'm like a mean coke I never go out of style
My hustle's goin' to good for me to go out and wild
But I got some gorillas at my disposal
Plus, I did my homework; nobody knows you
Lyin' about, how you and your click, rob shit
And a beat up hooptie, listenin' to my hits
But you funny niggaz, straight Bugs Bunny niggaz
Get everything on a layer way, no money niggaz
But your reputation proceeded you, beat it boo
Sleepin' on the uneatable, unbeatable, undefeatable
And still stand all the smoke
Highly underrated like Buddy McKird
Move around in a sudden silly puttin' me work
And no longer do I fuck with them crowds and merc

[Chorus](2x)

[A.G.]
Now I got money with drugs, and then a honey show love
I was bummy as fuck and the Tommies spit slugs
I was told to get a hold them old rapper blow 'em
Then vibe 'em with Diamond since the "Soul Clap" explosion
It's that versatile wild nigga A.G. I'm hot
Wanna get the drive on A.G. I don't see how nigga
I'll be waitin' for the M uno cool cat huh
But I'll end you though for actin' brand new yo
It's a grande culo y te gante es mucho
Smack her for puffin' a blunt way too slow
Slay 'em the Com way and I'ma tell 'em like my mom say
"Ain't too many y'all that can fuck with Andre"
See me and K-Ci, C-Town with a lot of cd's
Spit sums with meanings, thoughts with meanings
Gettin' dirty for the fuck of it
I get high with my chicks, cause they suckin' dicks
I've had enough of it

[Chorus](3x)</pre>
