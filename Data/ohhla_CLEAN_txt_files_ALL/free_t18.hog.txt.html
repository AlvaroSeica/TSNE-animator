Killa nigga (yeah) ay..

[Kyleon]
These nine shots from a 9 Glock, will put you in a pine box
On your back in paradise, mama trying to find plots
Fuck with me your time's out, better try to find cops
I'll have your family over the bed asking, (is he fine doc)
The flat line's out, they finna come and give you nine shocks
I'll have ya ass in heaven walking around, trying to find Pac
I'm not a martial artist, fuck with me you'll get your spine chopped
I'll have ya ass in heaven walking around, trying to find Pac
I'm not a martial artist, fuck with me you'll get your spine chopped
I'll have ya ass in heaven walking around, trying to find Pac
I'm not a martial artist, fuck with me you'll get your spine chopped
I look for trouble, like a dope fiend trying to find rocks
So when the nine's cocked, I'm punching the clock I'm ready to work
And lift niggaz spirits, like Pastors preaching in church
They call me the nurse, cause I'm the cat you see when you're hurting
Front you a few zones, so you can get back working
Front you a few zones, so you can get back working
Front you a few zones, so you can get back working
He's back black, the black cat
Serving you half-dollar flap jacks, posted up where the crack's at
I got young niggaz that hustle, put it in they backpack
With that cheese, purple Gator-aid vanilla extracts
Got gorillas that tech pack, in a tinted Lex black
Get green from the dread heads, white from them wetbacks
I'm at Ace, grinding where the check's at
I'm short stopping your licks, you better respect that nigga
Back on the block, I'm like Quincy Jones
You fuck with Kyleon sucker, I empty chrome
Fuck with Kyleon sucker, I empty chrome
Fuck with Kyleon sucker, I empty chrome
Leave you inside your brome, with a empty dome
My bullets make your mind go blank, like a empty phone nigga</pre>
