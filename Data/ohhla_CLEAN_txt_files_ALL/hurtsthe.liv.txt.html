[Verse 1: Stretch]
Woke up one morning and I'm feeling good
Misunderstood, I'm fucking king pin in my neighbourhood
Im getting money with my niggas
The young guns, time to bust pull their fucking triggas
It figures, the phone rang, ima bring some bad news
Tellin from the tone of his voice my nigga had the blues
Saying such and such call it what you want shots
In his body was discovered by the cops
The phone dropped, my brain locked in shock
Started smoking mad weed but the pain wouldnt stop
My nigga, they took my nigga, na fuck that
We going on a hunt and when i find him im a buck that
Fool til he drool and he croak
Im runnin on his block nigga watch the glock smoke
Provoke the hit shit i want my vengance
Then I skid off and get away with my intelligance
And then back around the way its so cold for you
Uh, gunshots to my fallen crew

[Chorus: Stretch &amp; 2Pac]
(Stretch) When your nigga dies it hurts the most
(2Pac)    Boom boom boom {*gunshot fires*} got me shootin at a ghost
(Stretch) When your nigga dies it hurts the most
(2Pac)    Boom boom boom {*gunshot fires*} got me shootin at a ghost
(Stretch) When your nigga dies it hurts the most
(2Pac)    Boom boom boom {*gunshot fires*} got me shootin at a ghost
(Stretch) When your nigga dies it hurts the most
(2Pac)    Boom boom boom {*gunshot fires*} got me shootin at a ghost

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Revenge is sweet
On the streets, understand me
Gotta retaliate get it straight, locate the niggaz family
And im rollin in my jeep top speed, ready to pull the trigger,
On any bitch ass nigga, who got weed
They killed my homie and im restless
Gotta get em back
A nigga with a mak and a deathwish
Tears in my eyes dont cry
Look up to the sky and wonder why
Do everybody gotta die
Another soulja in a casket
Cant eat, cant sleep, till i, bury them bastards
His family is fallin to pieces, his momma dont understand the madness
I cant explain the drama
And it hurts the most, when its someone close
I smoke weed, cause im losin hope,
And any dope can see, the ghettos fulla drug dealers
But aint nobody born a killa
but it hurts the most

[Chorus: Stretch &amp; 2Pac]
(Stretch) When your nigga dies it hurts the most
(2Pac)    Boom boom boom {*gunshot fires*} got me shootin at a ghost
(Stretch) When your nigga dies it hurts the most
(2Pac)    Boom boom boom {*gunshot fires*} got me shootin at a ghost
(Stretch) When your nigga dies it hurts the most
(2Pac)    Boom boom boom {*gunshot fires*} got me shootin at a ghost
(Stretch) When your nigga dies it hurts the most
(2Pac)    Boom boom boom {*gunshot fires*} got me shootin at a ghost

[Verse 3: Mopreme]
One man, drowing in the quick sand
Put my nigga down with my full proof plan
On the other avenues that we tried was blocked
So its time to put in work with the 10 milly plot
And in no time flat, had the fucking money sack
Im a guard it all a hundred g's in my arms
All thanks to my nigga
Who took the most risk, even though I was a little bigger
I thought it would be alright
Just bust another right and get ghost down a turn pright
But a fucking pig cut him off
My nigga won't soft, he let his 9 off
And that will be the only way I'll take it
Filled him full of led and Im raising his babies
Now the money dont come close
Cus when a friend dies it hurts the most me live the thug life

[Chorus: Stretch &amp; 2Pac]
(Stretch) When your nigga dies it hurts the most
(2Pac)    Boom boom boom {*gunshot fires*} got me shootin at a ghost
(Stretch) When your nigga dies it hurts the most
(2Pac)    Boom boom boom {*gunshot fires*} got me shootin at a ghost
(Stretch) When your nigga dies it hurts the most
(2Pac)    Boom boom boom {*gunshot fires*} got me shootin at a ghost
(Stretch) When your nigga dies it hurts the most
(2Pac)    Boom boom boom {*gunshot fires*} got me shootin at a ghost

[Verse 4: E-Moneybagz]
It started from, word to jerry, foes was buried
Started cruiteens adolescence commissaries
Campless militants early age, you aint getting shit
All the thoughts of sleeping with, cant we would have been living this
Bodies in the riversplit, drug kingpins, brothers finger split
Apples man called him Richie Rich
Them rollers in brooklyn was, the stories of me
No intent, remind of 50 cent
From for cream my niggas taught me,
A thug way of life, I was from Sumberland The boys caught me
The family came together, lawyer fees was costly
Thats I'm the general of the click, known as the boss E
I leave a thought, manifest the reality (stack god)
In the middle of the beef, expect of the casualty

[Chorus: Stretch &amp; 2Pac]
(Stretch) When your nigga dies it hurts the most
(2Pac)    Boom boom boom {*gunshot fires*} got me shootin at a ghost
(Stretch) When your nigga dies it hurts the most
(2Pac)    Boom boom boom {*gunshot fires*} got me shootin at a ghost
(Stretch) When your nigga dies it hurts the most
(2Pac)    Boom boom boom {*gunshot fires*} got me shootin at a ghost
(Stretch) When your nigga dies it hurts the most
(2Pac)    Boom boom boom {*gunshot fires*} got me shootin at a ghost

[Verse 5: Majesty]
Yo
My niggas gone and they still can't touch this shit
Sneaking from the grand stand with the ruckless shit
Got the manuscript to live
Stay survivers from the flesh of the spirit world always stay the loudess
Spittin out the tightess, so contraficial arthritis
Mayn aint no problem we cant solve
Fuck a harder semen
Immortal being
Its not a lie cus all ya'll seeing
Thug funkateer, thug life pioneers
Players of the year, we be players of the years
Shifting gears in the drop jag wiping off the tears
Want my niggas in the flesh here
Fuck the chanelling, whisper we all rushing through
Recking shit that gremelin
Like old times, back to back rocking hard rhymes
Hit the tunnel watch chickers rocker by me shine
It still goes on, but it'll never be the same niggas
Stretch, Big Yak, Pac, my thug main niggas

[Chorus: Stretch &amp; 2Pac]
(Stretch) When your nigga dies it hurts the most
(2Pac)    Boom boom boom {*gunshot fires*} got me shootin at a ghost
