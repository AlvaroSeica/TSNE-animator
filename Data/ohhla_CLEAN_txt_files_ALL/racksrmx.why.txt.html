Racks on racks on raaa-aa-acks

Bitch I hit one button, my roof open like a hard spot (Daaaaaamn!)
Make me throw my diamonds up, bitch my life was hard knock

All I sold is hund'uns, where the fuck my twenties at?

[Wiz Khalifa]
Uh...

Lookin at my Rollie, 'bout thirty grand what that cost
Smoke like I'm in Cali, fuck takin flight, I blast off
Niggaz talkin tattoos, we should have a tat-off
Got racks on racks on racks... naps on naps on naps
Just made a mil, count another mil, so put that on top of that
Way back in 2004, I told 'em it was a wrap
Now my life ain't my life no mo', I told you, nigga it's a wrap
OOOH~! you claim you a dog, my nig, I'm the vet
We cain't even talk 'less you cut the check 
I guess that's why all of these niggaz get bad 
They said, "Fuck a young nigga! Fuck a young nigga!"
I know it's some girls in the crowd right now who wanna fuck a young nigga - yeah!
I roll one and roll another one bigger
Niggaz thinkin they sick, well, I'm sicker

Stacks on top of stacks (Uh!)

Switch gears like stick shifts, fresh as hell, I'm Big Gipp

Pull triggers like hamstrings, boy I'm doin my damn thing

Hit corners, hit licks, hit stains (stains)

No, not +Bombs Over Baghdad+
But on the track, you can call me Hussein (Hoo-hah-hah!)
That's why they nervous {*gasp*}, like I'm flyin on the plane with a turban (woo!)
But I'm fly, y'all just turbulence -- exit row, emergency (Mayday!)
As a kid, I was struck by lightning (Pow!), it's no wonder I'm electrifyin
Ha! Fuck a brainstorm, I'll fuck around and cause a power outage (BANG!)
And it ain't no rivals, if it was, it'd be no survivors (No!)
But just gimme a hour, I'll light it up like an Eiffel Tower

Got pills all on my phone, these niggas know Im wrong
Said 50 for a song, and they wont leave me lone
Gotta front me a brick, that aint nothin to you
Just ran through a ticket, there aint nothin to do
Yeah, I love these streets like I love the booth

Got white on white on white, ice on ice on ice
And when Im in the club it look like lights on lights on lights

[Chorus]

I'm tryna smash and not call back

Wet my willie, might call you a cab, yeah
Ridin around wit that reefer scent 
Ridin around with Miss Reece and them
When I'm in the groove, I can freak a tune 
I'm smoother than, alopecia skin -- HAHA!!
I shows out, like dope when I put that flow down
Like soap when I put my clothes on 
I'm jokin, but I be foamed out
And all she want is more bags, but all I want is more ones
I told her bring that money back, like all them racks is Nordstroms - Whoooooa~!

[Cory Gunz]

See stacks from back of my slacks (slacks)

Then he black on 'em like Tae-Bo (Tae-Bo)

Throw sacks on 'em like y'all hoes (y'all hoes)
Got racks on 'em like tight hoooooes

Somethin tan with a mean jawboooone

One hat carry like four blades (four blades)

Been lootin money since like fourth grade
I'm the shit nowadays, so they wave (wave) 
No whips, no chains, I'm a slave (slave)
Let you niggaz know Milita my gang (gang) 
MC aim if you was thinkin it's a game (game)
See me with the twin, buck a shimmy with the gauge (gauge)

[Dose]

[Cory Mo]
Catch me in the city with the trunk on crack
Top dropped down, black on black
Fistful of wood, twisted for the good
Check my bank account, got racks on racks
Look around fool, got a wall full of plaques
Platinum and gold, you gots ta love that
Posted up just like a thumbtack
Better hide ya hoe, 'cause she bound to get snatched

She got a fat ass, she prol'ly know me well
Keep it on the low, never kiss and tell
True player, Cory Mo cold as hell
Shows to do, got records to sell
Got a whole lotta BMI checks in the mail
If ballin was a crime, I'd be in jail
Locked up for double life like "What the hell?!"

[Chorus]

[Nelly]
Yeah, they call me Country Grammar, my brother out the slammer

I'm not from Alabama, but check out how I roll +Tide+
He might have the same whip, but check out how I roll mine
Y'all niggaz ain't no stars (stars), y'all only in it for the cars (cars)
The sky is yo' limit mayne, and mine somewhere 'bout Mars
I ride wit them boys in the middle of the map
St. Louis, Detroit, Chi-Town, Nap
Down to the Dirty, back up through the trap
But the money don't stack man, money overlap
Yeah, y'all better watch it mayne, right here we lock and load
Two things is for certain mayne, and one thing is fa sho'
Got a house on hundred acres, I've never seen my neighbors
A chick in ATL and from Buckhead to Decatur (Let's go!)
Now y'all better leave me alone, got license for my chrome
Police on yo' mama phone talkin 'bout, "Yo' baby gooooone!"
Tell the truth, I ain't gon' lie (lie), I got so many rides (rides)
Don't know which one I'ma drive -- fuck it, I'm just gon' flyyyyyyy!

[Twista]
Everybody wanna hate because I'm on ('cause I'm on)
Blowin head back, bottles by the zone (by the zone)
Twista finna get up on the track and spit it the way I do 
simp-ily because I like this song (song)
When I step up out the Maserati car
Gotta pull it, pull it, pull it, pull it from the jar (jar)
Then I blow, I'ma close out the par'
Wit some killers and everybody know who we are
Get Money Gang steppin through the do' ('cago), Chicago, 'cago, 'cago ('cago)
Anybody wanna get into it, c'mon and do it 
Fuck security, we gon' make 'em feel the flo' (feel the flo')
Might as well get it off yo' chest
While everybody got ammunition on deck (on deck)
I don't see them, see them. as a, as a threat
'Cause I got racks on racks on racks (on racks)
Oh~! Twista, I see your future, finna shoot ya
I salute you if you could get at the general in my military
Racks and racks and tracks and stacks and gats
I-I-I could destroy an entire village when I kill and bury
'Cause I manipulate your molecular structure
Other words, fill 'em up wit holes (wit holes)
If you try to give it to me at the do' (at the do') 
I just thought I had to let you knoooow
(I bet yo' bitch call me Big)

[Big Sean]
Now I got single bitches tryin (tryin), married bitches lyin (lyin)
I take 'em to the crib and leave our future in a condom
I wake up fresher than these motherfuckers as is
Look inside my closet (Look!), that shit look like it's Raks Fifth (Raks Fifth)
Man, that's racks on racks on racks on top of packs on top of pounds
My chains is Pow! on Pow! on Pow!, I'm off them trees, no I ain't no owl
I'm at the altar sayin my vows, to this Benjamin Franklin pile
You buy her a house, I won't buy her a vowel
You fell in love and I fell in her mouth
They called her Dickface, she call the connect (call the connect)
You call her collect, I call to collect, no need for a pet
If I throw this paper, yo bitch gon' fetch! 
(...Do it) ...B-I-G
And Detroit gon' be aight as long as we got me - I do it

[Trae Tha Truth]

Track and field with the birds, I'm runnin 'em like track (track)
Free throws of money, bet you cain't block (block)

Bitch niggaz hate the fact I get gwap (gwap)

The club underwater, have 'em runnin out the front
While I'm somewhere in the back, gettin blowed like a blunt (blunt)

Couple of foreign cars that I ride no top (top)
Couple of whi-whips that I ride like yachts (yachts)
A couple of haters lookin, I'm knowin them niggaz hot (hot)

[Ace Hood]
Okay, I'm back off into this bitch (bitch!)
Wit a cup, and it's full of that liq' (Hot!)

Big stacks, no Lego bricks (Whoo!)
Hit a trick and if any nigga got it

Blew twenty bands in that King of Diamonds
Sorry, that's just part of my hobby (Swoop!)
And I hear 'em feelin my Florida swagger
So dope, shoulda sold y'all copies

Now anybody wanna play some hockey?! (HAAH!)

Paper tall as Shaq (Oh boy!)
