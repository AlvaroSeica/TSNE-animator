Song:   Sell My Soul
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Want me to sell my soul
Just so I can go gold
Homie I'm
(Listen up man, I'm a hard head, you understand that man I can't change my ways...)
Wantin' me to be Will Smith
But I gotta be Bow
Feel me, I"m
(Hey man, I'm a big fan of that man but I gotta create my own legacy...)
And all I need is drough
And NBAK10 a
Ad my niggaz and I'm
(That's all I need in this world to make me happy man)
You can have the cars, clothes
The jewerlies, the houses and ho's
Homie I'm
(If I gotta go through all that shit man, ya'll can take it back)

Hold up nigga, ya'll already know
Ya homie bow, people don't make full roll ups nigga
Nigga talk tough when they be on twitter
Then they see him out in person and they act like bitches
Man they hate on me cause they want my position
But I don't give a fuck homie I ain't trippin
Stay on me grind, goota hustle hard
Tryna put me out the game they don't wanna see ya...
Boy am I on other shit
D-damn man I'm bout to turn 23
Got me thinkin bout kids and a wife and a life
I ain't stuntin that nuffin if it ain't benefitin me
In this game dawg, ain't no loyalty
Cats do anything for a little bit of fame
And a little bit of change, niggaz switch crews
That's hip hop dick ridin and you look same
These record exec's don't know nothing dawg
All they do is sit up in their office ya'll
Perfect example New Jack City Pt 2
My last album that was Sony's fault
Got tired of that corny shit
Tired of all this phony shit
And I don't know you and you don't know me
So quit with all that 'homie' shit

Want me to sell my soul
Just so I can go gold
Homie I'm
(Wonderful music)
Wantin' me to be Will Smith
But I gotta be Bow
Feel me, I"m
(Wonderful music)
And all I need is drough
And NBAK10 a
Ad my niggaz and I'm
(Wonderful music)
You can have the cars, clothes
The jewerlies, the houses and ho's
Homie I'm
(Wonderful music)
Here I go!

Man the game has changed
106 ain't even the same
So hard for me to watch TV
Got thugs niggaz out here
Plottin on rap has changed
Man the game ain't what it used to be
Niggaz fake, niggaz envy
Industry snakes, they ain't friendly
Thought she loved me, she just tricked me
Hard to say now all fans are iffy
Cats send me demo's all the time
Then when they ask for some advice
I tell that young man stay in school
This rap shit, think it over twice
Chew you up then they spit you out
Here today then you gone tomorrow
Wathever you accomplish
They'll find another one to follow
Man that's just how the game is
M-man that's just how the game go
I've seen rappers make millions of this shit
When the work stops then they end broke
Gotta keep you gaurd up
Never know when a nigga out there tryna throw you a blow
Just thought I'd let you know... NO!
Leggo!

Want me to sell my soul
Just so I can go gold
Homie I'm
(Wonderful music)
Wantin' me to be Will Smith
But I gotta be Bow
Feel me, I"m
(Wonderful music)
And all I need is drough
And NBAK10 a
Ad my niggaz and I'm
(Wonderful music)
You can have the cars, clothes
The jewerlies, the houses and ho's
Homie I'm
(Wonderful music)
Here I go...</pre>
