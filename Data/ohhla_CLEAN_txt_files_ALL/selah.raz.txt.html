*Woman reciting prayer in Hebrew*

(Intro)
Father forgive us
Because we all have sinned
T.H.U.G. Angelz
Even thugs pray

(Chorus) 2x
This is a prayer for the thugs
I don't care if you're Damu or Cuz
Because it's God's love

[Hell Razah]
Do you believe in the prophecies
That the Messiah gon' free our seeds?
To bring the truth back to Tel Aviv
True indeed, we've been all deceived
Now America is under siege
Even the citizens overseas
Chemtrails in the air we breathe
At 13 and can barely read
But he can sell crack and roll weed
Niggaz acting like they don't bleed
Till is IV's and respirators
The board of ED can't educate us
Too many federal investigators
I left Hell in the elevator
Next stop is the Heaven Razah
To every bomb there's a detonator
Is every traitor part of Al-Qaeda?
Or is it greater if it's legislator or a slave-trader?
Either way they all need a prayer
Look at my logo and the moon crater
You can't hide behind ya top layer
But I'm the old serpent dragon slayer
Spitting lasers at space invaders
Keep an eye out for Tomb Raiders
We cry out to the true Savior
Another victim in the newspaper
I wonder why when the baby cry
Is his visions of the Most High?
Or is there Archangels close by?
12 Tribes be the lost bride
Until then she's a black widow
A young mother starring out a window
On a soft pillow, more tears
Dear Lord you're the one I fear
I say it loud and clear

Selah!
Wingz Up!
Heaven Razah!
