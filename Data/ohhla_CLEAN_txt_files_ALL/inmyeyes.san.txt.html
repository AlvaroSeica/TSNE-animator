I'm trippin, palm sweatin, brain steady like a feddi
Get ready Sanchos trippin bout to grab a machette
I'm violent, everybody better be quiet
Silence cause I don't want to be the cause of all of the desmadre
But suddenly this heina is druggin me
Damn I love a g, I think I'm fallin in love
But its only the ecstasy
Messin but me getting the high
Getting to the point I wanna die
But why should I couldn't deprive my self
One moment away from life
Grabe a knife I wanna slice my wrist
Get a little smoke from this cannabis
Can't handle this I'm feelin scandalous
I know my homies couldn't handle this shit
Enhance the sensual feelings that I had
I'm feelin mad but know I'm glad
Cause those times are out of me back

[Chorus]
In my eyes my visions Colorado and glossy
Glossy, ecstasy callin me, callin me please come home with me
In my eyes my visions Colorado and glossy
Glossy, ecstasy callin me, callin me please come home with me

Threw stage finally blew up from my rage
I'm rollin, rollin, rollin from this state of mind of visional wage
I'm feelin cautious at the same time I'm feelin nauseous
This baby girl's got me good, feelin like I'm mackin
So I'm bout to sip the e-c-s-t-a-c-y
Bumpin up my window clear, I'm still gonna get high
Rubin on the thighs, look into my eyes, what a surprise
A dilate is there like the moon in front of the sunrise
We get together, it's like of a stormy weather
I'm takin the guns, be bustin these nuts
Like givin a fuck, just tearin it up
Mija stand right where I can see ya
I feel the pastilla, enhance the feelings that I had
Sentado en la silla lap dance
Bumpin and grindin the ass, cold sweat
Heard her suck my dick
Do it quick, cause I got another scent to hit
Checkin her to the cama
After I hit I'm whyling to slip bitch

[Chorus]
In my eyes my visions Colorado and glossy
Glossy, ecstasy callin me, callin me please come home with me
In my eyes my visions Colorado and glossy
Glossy, ecstasy callin me, callin me please come home with me

Mirame don't be afraid 2 pastillas that I take
All the stuff the it's looking sick
Now get in to my eyes
Lets take another trip to another dimension
As I try not to mention desperately high
Section by section, of my favorite collection
As I take you all back to that night
My eyes where dilated and I felt alright
Despite of the ecstasy rollin up in my mind
Well all right I just might grab reality
Cause I was trippin that night
Enveses estaba ariba, enveses estaba abajo
Sentia que me movia de lado a lado
Como le ago para explicarlo
La pastilla azul me traia tumbado
I'm trippin, I'm flippin, I'm sittin of
Nobody comprehended why I'm being so demented
I'm not understandin so look

[Chorus]
In my eyes my visions Colorado and glossy
Glossy, ecstasy callin me, callin me please come home with me
In my eyes my visions Colorado and glossy
Glossy, ecstasy callin me, callin me please come home with me
In my eyes my visions Colorado and glossy
Glossy, ecstasy callin me, callin me please come home with me
In my eyes my visions Colorado and glossy
Glossy, ecstasy callin me, callin me please come home with me</pre>
