[Chorus]
Don't forget that the body talks
You've got to watch what you say with your body parts
We're in a day where they display the body art
But don't forget about the blaze that the body sparks (the body talks)

Don't forget that the body talks
You've got to watch what you say with your body parts
We're in a day where we display the body art
But don't forget about the blaze that the body sparks (the body talks)

[Verse One]
Now I'm about to build a case like a lawyer
I need grace cause I'm a face heat like a broiler
But I assure ya, I'm for ya
Represent the only God who would die and he's not Sawyer
I'll slow it down I'm a walk for ya
You've been goin' round lettin' the round parts of the body talk for ya
It's a sad state of affair
I'm aware with the rear
Some of y'all have gone and made a career
Nobody is seeking a hottie that's highly indecent
Except when they wanna use the hottie for obvious reasons
Please know you're body be speakin'
I'm not talking about the kind of body talk you get from out of Ephesians
I'm talking about the kind you hear on the ave
Where starers be at
They sit back and "mack" just to stare at your back
I wanna help but it's in the blood stream of the culture
And some of you queens are so mean I can't even approach ya

[Chorus]

[Verse Two]
Most women have care in their genes
Where's the care you killin' us today the way you're wearing those jeans
A few of us really care for the king
We've got to fight when you're in sight
For other men staring's no thing
"Well don't look then"
Well sis, I wasn't lookin'
But if I've gotta nose can I help smellin' the cookin'
I know you can blame it on the weakness of men
But the weakness is made weaker when we see your skin
Don't mean to offend but somebody needs to contend for sensitivity
Ok yeah the reason is sin
I'm not fakin' believe me
You're not makin' it easy
And I'm able to see the
Plot of Satan for sheezy
He's got us thinkin' it's easy
To watch the things on the TV
Then control the soul which gets inflamed when it sees these
Women who seem to think their body is free
Save it for your husband or maybe you're husband to be

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
You're probably thinking I'm not any fun
Consider girl we're in a world where if you're 12 you look 21
Men teach your sons when he's young
Or when slimmy comes he'll feed the sweet tooth he has for her "sinny-bun"
You know the logic- girls flaunt it cause they've got it
We want a project, yeah we wonder, "Could we knock it?"
Sorry brothers I'm unpackin' the plan
Sorry mothers we love ya but we learn to mack from a man
Relationships we see are quick- a flash in the pan
Marriages that stick are few- like Blacks in Japan
Big bottoms have got a lot of men trapped in a trance
Their flesh causing lots of interest like cash in advance
If that was your plan it worked because you're all that
But all that says to us is that you might be faster than a corvette
Listen ladies I implore you to be pure
If not read Isaiah 3:16-3:24
But don't
