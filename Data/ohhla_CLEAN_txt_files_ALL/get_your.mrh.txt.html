[JD]
Hah, you know girl, it's crazy
See I've always been wantin' a girl like you
So fine, motherfucker, he he he
Can I, can I get your number

[JD]
Oh damn, the club bout to close in a minute
Can I get your number baby so you and I can go get in it
Let me come and pick you up, oh, and go take you out, oh
Can I get your number baby so I can show you what I'm all about
What I'm all about, damn

[Mariah]
I've been checkin' you out
And I noticed that you ain't just one of the crowd
So tell me won't you, come on and see about me baby
I've go the Crys on ice, I'm bout to get nice
Up in V-I-P with all my ladies
Tell me how many times in your life
Will you get an opportunity like this tonight
Tell me a little somethin' bout you
Here's a little somethin' bout me
I got a house in Capri and my own G4
And a Benz with the doors that lift up from the floor

[JD] (Mariah)
Oh damn, the club bout to close in a minute (ooh)
Can I get your number baby so you and I can go get in it
Let me come and pick you up, oh, and go take you out, oh (take me out)
Can I get your number baby so I can show you what I'm all about (yeah)
What I'm all about, damn

[Mariah]
Now that you're sitting next to me, I bet you're wondering
What my intentions are for you and I to get into
Baby I just wanna hug and kiss and love ya
Look into my eyes, baby don't be shy
Is it yes or no, we ain't got all night
Tell me how many times in your life
Will you get an opportunity like this tonight
Tell me a little somethin' bout you
Here's a little somethin' bout me
I've got a big penthouse with a sick hot tub
We can watch the flat screen while the bubbles fillin' up

[JD] (Mariah)
Oh damn, the club bout to close in a minute (ooh)
Can I get your number baby so you and I can go get in it
Let me come and pick you up, oh, and go take you out, oh
Can I get your number baby so I can show you what I'm all about
What I'm all about, damn

[Mariah]
Lalalala, la, la
Lalalala, lalalala
Lalalala, la, lala, lala, lala, lala
Lalalala, la, la
Lalalala, lalalala
Lalalala, la, lala, lala, lala, lala
Oh baby

[JD] (Mariah)
Oh damn, the club bout to close in a minute (ohh)
Can I get your number baby so you and I can go get in it (I wanna)
Let me come and pick you up, oh, and go take you out, oh
Can I get your number baby so I can show you what I'm all about
What I'm all about, damn</pre>
