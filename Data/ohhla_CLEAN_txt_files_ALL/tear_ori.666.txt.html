(Verse 1, DJ Paul)
This goes out to playa haters
Who be talkin' the shit
I hold yo head down and I fuck you
Like a common bitch
You can be my real ho
Kind of down, or not
I'm rollin wit' a nigga named Crunchy
Like to clown a lot
Backed up, by the four-five and the thirty-eight
Automatic G-L-O, plus the C and the K
Pristine old Mossburg, wit' the slugs and shit
We got some graves for ya body
Already dug and shit
Infamous, grab the tally with a hundred rounds
Koopsta, load the tech and blow them bastards down
Juicy with the two nines, like the nigga named Shine
On them movies, shootin' em up so bad they killed sometimes
I thought you knew that I'm from Memphis
Where this shit is so thick
Quit actin' foe, we get so buck
We tried to tell some shit
Get on that hustle and cheese
Ridin' clean in old car
So what the fuck you standin' there
Look like tryina steal yo car
You better find a real nigga
Who done lic'd you up
Put the tone up to your head
And make her spit it up
(fades, bad recording)
A rusty ass thirty-third
Will cold split yo brains, bitch

(Hook)
Tear da club up, nigga tear da club up
Tear da club up, nigga tear da club up
Tear da club up, nigga tear da club up
Tear da club up, nigga tear da club up

Tear da club up, nigga tear da club up
Tear da club up, nigga tear da club up
Tear da club up, nigga tear da club up
Tear da club up, nigga tear da club up

(Verse 2, Lord Infamous)
As I cut, guts pour
Blood washes from the shore
To the sand, as a thousand veins slither through my hand
Could and will, stand that man
From the under-land of pain
As his brains, hit the grains
And I buried the remains
Wit' my thangs
Piercing through a bitches jergurler
Infamous thangs, with psychotic interior
Killas, the triple-six murderers
I leave 'em another penalty
Covered, I'm ready to cook
And I pick up the hook
Cause these niggas is took
By the Infamous crook
And I'm off yo embelicle
Jump off a roof, key
Choppin' through miss niece
With the N-I-N, E
Slug, gets drug
And bloody up your rug
Because we really love to make a stang
It's the high capital, make me touch ya mind
I got the scope, but not the kind that kills bad breath
I got the kind that likes to cut quick your good health
Everybody in this bitch just whip some shit up
I don't give a fuck, it ain't my stuff
You can tear this club up

(Hook)
Tear da club up, nigga tear da club up
Tear da club up, nigga tear da club up
Tear da club up, nigga tear da club up
Tear da club up, nigga tear da club up

Tear da club up, nigga tear da club up
Tear da club up, nigga tear da club up
Tear da club up, nigga tear da club up
Tear da club up, nigga tear da club up

Tear da club up, tear da club up nigga
Tear da club up, tear da club up nigga
Tear da club up, tear da club up nigga
Tear da club up, tear da club up nigga

Tear da club up, tear da club up nigga
Tear da club up, tear da club up nigga
Tear da club up, tear da club up nigga
Tear da club up, tear da club up nigga</pre>
