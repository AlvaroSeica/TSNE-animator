[Intro: Wale]
Let me rap to you real quick..
I wanna enjoy the luxury of like, not knowin each other, f'real..
Hol'up..

[Miguel]
Lotus flower bomb, fire flies
When I'm low, she take me HIIIGH
I can teach you all the sounds of love

[Wale]
Flower bomb, lemme guess your favorite fragrance
And you got that bomb *huh*, I'm tryna detonate ya
No disrespectin baby, just tryna make you smile
Shawty keep my spirits up, that's why I lays it down
Shawty keep yo' spirits up, lil' vodka whatever
Took her forever to get dressed, I acknowledge your effort
So I clap for her, she deserves an applause
Shawty workin so hard, she deserve that baton
Shawty, where yo' baton? Racin through my mind like
She heard that, I got that work, I heard that she been on strike
Care to tell? I read your mind, she been on them dollars first
Caramel, macchiatos when shawty get into work
I can be your boyfriend, be yo' nigga or a friend with perks
I'm just tryna work that *huh*, they just tryna work yo' nerves
I'm just tryna read your mind, I'm just tryna feed you mine
I'm just tryna give you life, they just tryna lead you blind

[Chrous: Miguel]
We livin in a faaaaan-tasy
I feel it when you daaaaaance with me
It's feeling like you neeeeed to be
my lady, my baby, yeah...
Caaaaaaan't you see?
I'm talkin 'bout eterrrrnity
Tell me would you caaaaare to be
my lady, my baby...

[Wale]
Flower bomb, can I blow up on your mind?
This is not no Sandra Bul', but you're +Potion No. 9+
Navigatin thru her eyes, destinations to her thighs
And I hate to tell you too much, 'cause I stay with too much pride
And we way to young to know love, maybe not but we don't need no rush
Don't believe in love at first sight, but I believe in love at first *heh*
Can I be with you just one night? I can wear you out inside
I can tell you like persistence, but I make you cum in tri's
I just think we need one night, can't decide if I came right
Easy baby my thang tight but that lotus flower just ain't right
I ain't thinkin, I ain't right, cain't decide but I cain't fight
Easy baby, you're the bomb and all, but I'll be damned if I do not land mine 
or at least try, can I speak up? Was it peace out? Can we eat lunch?
Can we take shots with your flavor? Flat drinks, we call A-cups
I just think I need one night, slightly more if it's done right
With that gorgeous face, I don't know your name
It ain't important babe, 'cause I'ma call you mine

[Chorus]

[Outro: Miguel]
'Cause I don't know you, you don't know me
The clock keeps tickin baby, what's it gon' be?
I don't know you, you don't know me
Lemme teach you all the sounds of love
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, eh-e-eh-e-eh
Ie-e-ie-e-ie, I-o-ooooou
Baby, this one's for you (for you)
