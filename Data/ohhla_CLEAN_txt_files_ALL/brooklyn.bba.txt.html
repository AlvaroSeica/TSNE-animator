[Soul Khan]
The Wrath of Khan continues...
I got my peoples with me; Koncept and J57 of the Brown Bag AllStars...
We got Melton Sharpe on the beat...
And we gonna show you how we wreck shop... so let me begin...

How in the name of Soul Khan can you be pleadin' the fifth
when I accuse you of bitin' and you bleed from the lip
you must be feelin' real heavy from these steezes you lift
'cause if I take a shit these plagiarists come creepin' to sniff
yo my words are similar to persian scimitars
swung from the lungs of an urban minotaur
some things you can't learn in church or seminar
the best die and the rest turn to cenataurs
except a select few, the rest will oppress you
it's ten o'clock sucka, who the fuck will protect you
see I L-O-L at what these fellows sell
I'm like all ten plagues in a mellow shell
or like Paul Pierce prayin' when his elbows fell
and then he opened up his eyes thinkin "well, oh, well"
we in the biggest division since they split the religions, it's
hard to box God when you're missin' your ligaments, yuck

[DeeJay Element scratches Keith Murray]
"Can't wait to face ya, mutilate ya
Drink ya style down straight with no chaser
Can't wait to face ya, to face ya
I love to hate ya, 'cause you's a freak by nature"

[Koncept]
A designer that paints, an emcee that digs
moved from Queens to B-K, live right near the bridge
the mic fears this kid 'cause I'm so raw on it
shattered all your dreams when you broke your promise
to stay true, remain through ridiculous nonsense
the only left standin' is this kid named Koncept
content is real, somethin to feel when honest
I'm drivin on a distance I guaranteed accomplished
the kid I left behind just didn't put his hand in
when the weight's unbalanced, it's harder to stand in
the same spots when names dropped, I had to keep it movin'
unlock the gates, the key is this music and
Keith is the future so please just excuse him
when he knocks you out the frame in his lane he's persuin'
and he's gainin' in this game, it's a shame when you lose it
when bringin' up my name, I am great, don't confuse it

[DeeJay Element scratches Keith Murray]
"Can't wait to face ya, mutilate ya
Drink ya style down straight with no chaser
Can't wait to face ya, to face ya
I love to hate ya, 'cause you's a freak by nature"

[J57]
Raise they arms givin' praise on this god given day
but where was God when their arms give a spray
of stray bullets, they may, look in a different direction when they point fingers
annoint thinkers made in a Lord willin' way
so, read it and weep and take a seat in defeat
already seven steps ahead before they're leavin' their feet
seein' them leave in retreat, runnin' through the crowd riflin' 
takin' it back, ruin their life again like Vicodin
too hot, fahrenheit high like hide your fever
dunk-Skittle-rappers stuck in the '80's like wide recievers
fumblin' back, fuck 'em, now they got me ramblin'
first hit's for free, then they runnin' back/runningback like Rodney Hampton
Brown Bag time travel black holes
bring Terror to your Squad with no Pun like Fat Joe
lettin' his gat blow, we villainous rascals
no filler in this pillage, carniverous assholes, bring it
