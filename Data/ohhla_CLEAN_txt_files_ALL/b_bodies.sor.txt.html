Wussup Rock
Yall know I'm rockin' the Benz, poppin the drop vet, uh

{verse 1}
I took the tints off the six so you could see me with ya bitch
With a icey wrist Sippin on cris
Bumpin Jay-Z shit, his latest hits
Ridin' with a big gun and 'bout thirty bricks
If the cops pull me over, everything for the bitch
Every gram, even the big gun for the bitch
'Cause I told her I was hot before she jumped in
And if I go down thats my third convict
But if the hoe go down buy out the bitch
She'll be home tonight for all thirty kilo's
Me, I'd be drove with all kinda hoes
You know I'm on parole, got a white P.O.
Wouldn't leave a nigga hoe for a million bucks
My mansions, my watches and cars and trucks
I'm livin' marvelous, I aint starvin' bruh
Uptown, ghetto nigga from New Orleans bruh
I got a mansion on the beach wodie im livin' the life
Put crystal in a cup to use my watch for ice

[chorus]
Big Body on brabus, that's all I know
Big body on brabus, that's all I know
Mansion on Washington 6 figures on the floor
Mansion on Washington 6 figures on the floor
Big Body on brabus, that's all I know
Big body on brabus, that's all I know
Big body on brabus, that's all I know
Mansion on Washington 6 figures on the floor

{verse 2}
Smoked outt millionaire iceberg rocker
Got tired of driven' cars and bought a bently helicopter
Baby nephew Derrick, thats who I am
My mama named Durkie and my daddy named Yan
Smoked outt rich nigga, got money to blow
Spend a million a day and be far from broke
Got enough coke to charge a nigga a G for a 4
Bently payed out, you gotta see it, its nice
Roley, fulla ice it'll hurt your sight
In the casino shootin' craps with some platinum dice
I'm a young nigga suck at ballin and im playin' with some chedder
Bought a roley that was so iced out, cant look at the bezel
I got reppin' rights
I got a Bent with the random stripes
loud pipes
Plus I spent 100 grand on my bently bike
I rock ice wodie

[Chorus]

{Verse 3}
Young nigga money long, I'm playin' with major loot
Got a 8-50 beamer coup, windows bullet proof
Got a Benz motor bike with bubble-eyed lights
Woom-woom-woom, the sound of my pipes
Got a sprint phone with so many minutes
Bank account over-fulled my credit card got no limit
With the sacks with 10 stacks
Me and my bitch done bought iceberg, whole rack
Smoked outt rich nigga, how ya lovin' that
Win dixey baby thinkin' bout buyin that
Super dome, look at the receipt, we brought that, brought that

[chorus until end]</pre>
