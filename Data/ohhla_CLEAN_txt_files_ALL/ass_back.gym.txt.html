Song:   Ass Back Home
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Chorus: Neon Hitch]
I don't know, where you're goin
or when you're coming home
I left the keys under the mat
to our front door-oh-oh-ohoh-oor
For one more chance to hold you close
I don't know, where you're goin
just get your ass back home

[Travie McCoy]
We both knew this type of life didn't come with instructions
So I'm trying to do my best to make something out of nothin
And sometimes it gets downright shitty in fact
When you call and I don't even know what city I'm in at
Or what day of the week in the middle of the month in a year I don't recall
It's like my life's on repeat and the last time we spoke I told you I wouldn't be long
That was last November, now December's almost gone
I'd apologize but I don't realize what I'm doin wrong
I never know

[Chorus]

[Travie McCoy]
And you've been nothin but amazing and I'll never take that for granted
Half of these birds would have flew the coop but you, you truly understand it
And the fact you stood beside me every time you heard some bogusness
You deserve a standin O cause they'da just been over it
Let 'em talk, let 'em talk, let 'em talk, let 'em talk
Like we don't hear what they sayin
Let 'em walk, let 'em walk, let 'em walk, let 'em walk
We'll just drive by and keep wavin
Cause you and I above all that, just let 'em wallow in it
Now they all choked up, yuck; cause they be swallowin it

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
No one holds me down like you do sweetheart
You keep doin that, I'll keep doin this and
We'll be alright in the end - trust that
We put the us in trust, baby
Aowww~! Let's go

[Travie McCoy]
I don't care what you're after
As long as I'm the one, no
I don't care why you're leavin
You'll miss me when you're gone

[Chorus]

[Outro: Travie McCoy]
I'm home baby! Hehehe</pre>
