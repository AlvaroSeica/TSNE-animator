[Pusha T]
Beef is best served like steak well done
Get a gun in your face, bitch nigga
Beef will have you prayin to God
Move your kids, have you hidin your mom
Beef is when you hide behind them other niggaz
But they ain't killers they ain't pullin them triggers, fuck niggaz
Beef will have you keyin our cars
Heartbroke, yours don't look like ours

[The-Dream]
Them niggaz ain't dyin for you
Them niggaz ain't dyin for you

[Pusha T]
Throwin that flag up runnin around you hot shit
Takin half of everythin you get

[The-Dream]
Them niggaz ain't dyin for you
Them niggaz ain't dyin for you

[Pusha T]
Contract all fucked up
I guess that means you all fucked up
You signed to one nigga that signed to another nigga
That's signed to three niggaz, now that's bad luck
Damn that shit even the odds now
You better off sellin this hard now
You call it livin out your dreams
You can't fly without your wings
You get it
Jeremy Scott's all camouflaged
You can't hide it from yourselves, career sabotaged
I was really in that Travelodge
You just lyin through your catalogues
Where the blood and the battle scars?
We the ones that judge jugglin the gavels on
Put me to the body, nigga
First 48 put us to them bodies, nigga
Round here we don't play that
A to the K that, spray that, lay back
You can keep your beats, nigga
We'd much rather share your bitch, nigga, bitch nigga
3 million can't hide that
It shows in the homes I done tried that
That's why you'll never be my neighbors
Smile as you wavin but we know you niggaz hate us
Fuck you playin games for?
Don't be scared get everythin you came for
They got you talkin that big shit
Little do you know we don't miss shit
Them niggaz usin you as a pawn
You see they never loaded they guns
Now you out here all by yourself
Ask Steve Jobs' wealth don't buy health

[Chorus]

[Outro: Notorious B.I.G.]
What's beef? Beef is when you need two gats to go to sleep
Beef is when your moms ain't safe up in the streets
Beef is when I see you
Guaranteed to be in ICU, one more time
What's beef? Beef is when you make your enemies start your Jeep
Beef is when you roll no less than thirty deep
Beef is when I see you
Guaranteed to be in ICU, check it</pre>
