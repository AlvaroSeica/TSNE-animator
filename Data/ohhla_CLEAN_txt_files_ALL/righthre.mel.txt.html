Ohh! Ohh
Slow it down, ha ha
Left Brain is a beast ain't he?

[Hodgy Beats]
Can all my sexy ladies wave your hands right here?
This, track is peanut butter so we jam right here
I'm flirtin with you in your ears, and your mans right here
Plotting on how I'm gonna do these fuckin skins right here
Fellas get them hands higher, smoke them grams right here
Model chicks walking by and it's yo' chance right here
Confidence is a reality, your friends might fear
But I'm comin out this club with some twins, my dear
And we headed to the whip where we can smoke right here
Got the girls, got the Henny, got the Coke right here
Now she callin me her baby like I'm in a high chair
I swear, I fear, not a thing right here

[Chorus]
I kick rhymes all the time, I get high all the time
Can't nobody stop the vibe that I'm feelin right here
Bitch dimes on the grind, you can't cop it for the nine
Can't nobody stop the tribe and how we livin right here
And we rollin, we rollin, we smoke and blow
And can't nobody stop the vibe that I'm feelin right here
And we rollin, we rollin, we smoke and blow
Can't nobody stop the tribe and how we livin right here

[Hodgy Beats]
How you feel 'bout me caressin your blessings? Lesson after lesson
like an adolescent that constantly gettin in trouble
That bad ass need a whoopin, whoopie cushion belt pushin
With the Wolves in his nature, group huddles?
The kush is in the jar and the blunts are in the car
Blow Indian indicas like Jafar we be who we are
And we do what we does, cause we does what we do
Spark the weed Pikachu, pizza booze, we can chew
And drink the same time and think the same mind
Mental telepathy, leprosy, lettin C runnin through
my legs and feet, walking what we preach, we don't gotta teach
Just put one in the air, my dear, I swear
It's hundred percent everything right here

[Chorus] - 2X</pre>
