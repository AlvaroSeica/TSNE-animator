(12 o'klok)
I heard some niggas was ill-talking
Dipping in family matters and still walking
About to fly his fucking dome into a steel-coffin
Pianos and organs, little children left his office
Washing over the bullet wounds, body squeaking like dolphins
Niggas got vendettas, about to finger fuck this black beretta
Let it ejaculate all over the motherfuckers sweater
Navigators to jettas, we coming ready for whatever
Executions get major we taking drastic measures
Ill-Sicilians want us to compromise on making millions
Figure we nothing but black children from project buildings
That's where the beef started
Bitch made nigga was sheep hearted
Got paid off to seize that information before the police caught it
I got the word from Carlita, she twerk the beaver
Told one of them snitch niggas she was with him and he believed her
Silent retreiver, ghetto assassin saw them niggas passing
Tarentinas done made them willy so they flashing
Clutching my magnum, Carlita telling me don't blast him
That nigga be knowing shit, let me holla at him
You see, same way them tarentinas use them niggas to get to us
We use them niggas to get back at the tarentinas and we turn them all into dust
False fabrication, we laid back at the moves we making
While talking to me she thinking rush throughout the conversation
Sex him up a little have him thinking he's the willyiest
Fuck it and even if he don't believe make him feel he is
Tell him you want a meeting with the don
Pick the place and time
He respect you as a boss bitch cause a boss bitch is hard to find 
Tap the pager, fuck it tell him you want to take him to vegas
Buy him a blazer, roll up his blunts, lace him in gators
Within a month, she had him giving information up front
And I was screaming fuck the tarentinas and the family all at once
She gave him orders
Told him to set up a meeting at the quarters
Command his palace, eight o'clock on the dot, no shorter
A couple of nights later we in the quarter surrounding haters
Some niggas thinking they played us, others thinking they made us
But we stretched out, across the street in the hummer sessed out
Waiting for the dime, so we can drop a bomb and blow his vest out
And there he is covered with mobsters, lawyers and doctors
Couple of niggas on his dick, organized imposters
Fly that motherfuckas head I heard a shot ring
Carlita watch me, cover my back while I handle this properly
Cross the avenue, felt it was something I had to do
Saw a 13 year old twisting off a white lid so I blasted too
Watch the don drop, a message to the local crime watch
Either we leave it like it is or make this madness non-stop
Paparazzi got it covered, bodies in clusters 
Motherfuckers twisted to die and theres 17 others
How can I respect an establishment that don't respect us
Niggas detest us, ill-natured shit never let it infect us
I stayed sober, tomorrow morning I'll be off in the rover
Business as usual with my niggas up in Minnesota 
For clovers, lesson was learned when all this shit was over
Watch your enemies close but watch associates closer
Warning posters showing mob niggas and jive niggas
But don't nobody fuck with my niggas 
Get ill and you die nigga when you least detect it
Niggas infected, we living reckless
Now nigga trying to hit me up with that respect shit
I contest it, money, bitches and blood that how they left it
They love acceptance, I learn to love the niggas I was blessed with
Behind the scene workers, from lawyers to county clerkers
Black I swear to god this shit was like a circus but its family matters</pre>
