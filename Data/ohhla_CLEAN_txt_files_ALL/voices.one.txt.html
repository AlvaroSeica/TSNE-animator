Hahahaaaaaa... I'm back now watch yourselves

(Verse 1)

Lets talk about sex let's talk about reps
Talk about lust and talk about trust talk about death 
And talk about lies talk about truth and talk about life 
I know soon I go see me come back with about 10 crows 
So I make it all simple you, you and the world a nickel 
Sicko status who be the baddest motherfucker 
Watch when I buck you all of this arson all of this fire 
You be the G liar, liar quiet hums then I come 
Who who Mr. Lil One evilish ways devilish style 
Selfish pitiful greedy times

(Chorus)

Sometimes I feel so alone
Hear these sick thoughts going through my dome
Voices playing with my head 
Some times I wish I was dead

(Verse 2)

Lets talk about day talk about night talk about wrong 
And talk about right talk about truth talk about faith
Talk about you and talk about snakes wait till the grand finale 
Now Lil One blowing up in Cali had it bag it feeling the fans
Everybody knows I'm the man crystal clear how you fear
Me Lil One every time I'm near, beer I love it ghost I love them
And what about hoes I think nothing of them
Enemies run damage is done why why they fin to get done
Satanical sign dramatical times all cuz I'm sick in the mind

(Chorus)

*(last part dead repeated three times)

(Verse 3)

Lets talk about you talk about me talk about us 
And talk about greed Talk about hoes and talk about sluts 
Talk about girls and talk about mutts, why must I feel this way? 
All this pain every single day Moms is gone music is lost
Still I feel all of this wrong all this hate all this drama 
All of this hate from my baby momma
Making up lies family ties shred it poke and sitting here coping
Frown on my face hope that she taste 
Some of this shit when it blows in her face

(Chorus)

(Lil One Talking)

That's Lil One that's Lil One that's Lil One 
Coming for you But you know this and you know this gone</pre>
