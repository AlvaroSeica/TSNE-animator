[Intro]
Haha its yo boy
The loc S-P-I the first round draft pick
G-Unit!
The west rider! Da Riffs! EA Sports!
I don't know what they thinking but they got us mixed up
Watch me do what I do what I do what I do and I do it to you

[Hook]
It's Elementary
Just pay attention it aint hard to tell
You can tell who sent me
with G-Unit clique its hard to fail
Why do y'all resent me
It ain't my fault thats hard to sell
And evidently
I'm doing too much far as I can tell

[Verse 1]
I'm just a bit better and better than best
And my wits better than the wit of the west
I'm stayin 7 steps ahead of the rest
And Ive been heaven sent but never the less
You keep being impatient but never impressed
you got vocab issues that you need to address
You do weird type of things to relieve your stress
That can kill your whole career of you linked to press
Me and myself can fight us but I speak to bless
And within each verse we can deep vinness
You can call me the room cus I sweep the mess out the door tycoon well about to go!
We can jack from checkers, and I leap to chess
He gots to go get the record and peep to this
Y'all imitate us while we invest in us represent for the whole E-S

[Hook]
It's Elementary
Just pay attention it aint hard to tell
You can tell who sent me
with G-Unit clique its hard to fail
Why do y'all resent me
It ain't my fault thats hard to sell
And evidently
I'm doing too much far as I can tell

[Verse 2]
I get doe for the flow cus I got skills
Even more for the show cus I got bills
I'm on the role on the low cus I got wheels
Heard the song on the playback and I got chills (for real!)
It aint no doubt to me
The amout of big skrill im about to see
Went to private sckool but turned out a G
I kept my eyes on fools and learned how to be
When its time to go though I show up the best
Who else is true enough to sew up the west (nobody!)
In the hood they like for us its S-P-I so fly with so much vinness
Yall little chumps cant see my chips in change
I'm lokee but I keep my rips in range
Pay attention maybe you can get some game
And did I mention the flow I flip is flame

[Hook]
It's Elementary
Just pay attention it aint hard to tell
You can tell who sent me
with G-Unit clique its hard to fail
Why do y'all resent me
It ain't my fault thats hard to sell
And evidently
I'm doing too much far as I can tell

[Verse 3]
By now you should know you cant hang with me
Cus I spit that flow and I bang that G (G-Unit!)
Us youngsta just went from rags to riches
And G-Unit kicks and we sag like britches
And we showin up is the worst surprise
My diamonds glow enough thatll hurt ya eyes
Yo money get at me but we first advise
Do I know how to put in work or wise
Yo wallets gonna have to be a certain size
And you can get that big head sircome sized
While you search them skies
I'm a merchandise
And mark it that way my work get rised
We can battle I got a freestyle degree
But for paper I dont kick styles for free
The journey to the top has been miles for me
And ima stay till it hit 3003

[Hook]
It's Elementary
Just pay attention it aint hard to tell
You can tell who sent me
with G-Unit clique its hard to fail
Why do y'all resent me
It ain't my fault thats hard to sell
And evidently
I'm doing too much far as I can tell

For real man, gone have a seat
Let the bosses do this the Gs in the house
Theyve been waitin on me, wait no longer
We in here, im in the cut, but right now its Tony time
Do ya thang boy!
