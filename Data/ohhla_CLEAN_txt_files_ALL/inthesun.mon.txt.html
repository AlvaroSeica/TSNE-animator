Typed by: AZ Lyrics

We're out in the sun
Low as possible (don't cry)
We're out here in the sun
Low as possible (don't cry)
We're out here in the sun
Low as possible (don't cry)
We're out here in the sun
Low as possible (don't cry)
We're out here in the sun
Low as possible (don't cry)
We're out here in the sun
Low as possible (don't cry)

[Curren$y]
Penning these lyrics from a hammock
With an ounce of kush and a pack of bamboos and a ice cream sandwich
I'm that dude
game given to you from a og point of view
usually I sell it but I got enough to share with ya
Baby if you cookin rolling weed I be so happy with ya
Fuck it you so good you know I'm cheating it won't matter to ya
You know how daddy do ya spit em make the jet maneuvers
Hop out the club don't pur vally won't get a chance to move it
I'm out before I hear the music thats how quick the hoes be choosin
I don't call it pussy be scrawling to me homeboy
I don't know who did what
Cuz I was in the cut
Rolling tropicals
Sitting Low as possible
Yewuh

Relax under the sun
Low as possible
Relax under the sun
Low as possible
Relaxd on the sun
Low as possible
Relaxd under the sun
Low as possible
Relaxd on the sun
Low as possible

French Montana
Shawty pussy be the meaniest
I be balling all arenas
Homie high swearing some venus
I mean is when I tell you that I want it I don't need it
They be known in for procedures
Shawty yelling from the bleachers
Got me reaching like a two guard
two hard ski mask on suit on
Five chains canaries help me cool off two dog
Camaro like Larry flint
block star Rock star
Montana Aerosmith
Forty spit
Homies niggas dying out
I be flying out
Feds on my niggas tail he hiding out
Montana sliding out
Baby don't be fucking with my hot
Suck a nigga dry
I be low as possible tryna clear up my mahind
Montana B'c

Relax under the sun
Low as possible
Relax under the sun
Low as possible
Relaxd on the sun
Low as possible
Relaxd under the sun
Low as possible
Relaxd on the sun
Low as possible</pre>
