You lookin too good
What you standing over there by yourself for
Won't you come over here..

Unh... 
I think it's time we take a trip, tell me where
Tell me where you wanna go ah (you want go)

Just follow me baby...take you where you need to be)

Girl you know that you the shh, 'way you walking wit them heels on
Talking to me dirty yo body I wanna feel on (feel on) feel on (feel on)
Once I get to you I promise we gonna go re-real long

Nothing's more important than gettin our fairytale on (tale on)
