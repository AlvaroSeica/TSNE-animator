[ASAP Rocky]
I be that pretty mothafucker, Harlem's what I'm reppin
Tell my niggaz quit the bitchin, we gon' make it in a second
Never disrespected, plus I'm well connected
With this coke that I imported, just important as yo' President
Swagger so impressive, and I don't need a necklace
But these bitches get impressed when, you pull up in that 7
Them 6's, them Benzes, I gets gets the freshest
Raf Simons, Rick Owens usually what I'm dressed in
Rollin blunts, rollin doobies up, smokin section
Groupies rush, hold they boobies up in my direction
Quit with all the frontin, you ain't 'round my clique for nuttin
Cause our presence is a present, just to kick it is a blessin

[Chorus]
This is the way it goes, this is the way we roll
Cause everyday we on our pesos, pesos
This is the way it goes, this is the way we roll
Cause everyday we on our pesos, pesos
(Gun cock, gun shot, gonna lick a boy) {*3X*}
Cause everyday we on our pesos

[ASAP Rocky]
Yo' yo' yo' bitch just said I'm hot, man I told her I agree
She gon' really think I'm hot, if I told her my degrees
Pull up in that hard-top, showin off my keys
Graduate school of hard knocks, I can show you my degrees
Couple A, B, C's, bad bitch, double D's
Poppin E, I don't give a F, told you I'm a G
A.S.A.P., Stevie got it on his sleeve
But I got it on my chest, my nigga this is what I breathe
Inhale, exhale, cocaine, ex' pills
Import, export, Harlem catchin wreck still
So mami show me how that neck feel
Later show me how the rest feel, for now just chill

[Chorus]</pre>
