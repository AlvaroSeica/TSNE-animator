[Chorus: The Internet &amp; Left Brain]
I was rollin through the ghetto
In my Lincoln Continental
Blowin kush smoke out the window
What you think my windows tint fo'?

[Mike G]
Yo, uhh, yo
It go drastic, measures in a tale so tragic
Follow formula six-four as you trail my tracks
Bitch, there's nothin more pleasant than gettin paid on point
Pretty bitches with gold grills just to hold my joints
I make 'em plead - as the director says scene
New words, don't say my name, I just make 'em say King
Four rings on that muh'fuckin woodgrain wheel
Raw, I'm Johnny Law, but you should check my appeal
Once upon a time not too far back
There was a young Wolf Pack that grew up in a 'llac
Syd left King, and Ace played Black Jack
Bitches be talkin shit that's how you end up smacked
I'm after chips and if we eatin then I'm after your bitch
Ain't no cost, just pimpin player you should be after the risk
We winnin like there ain't no other way to play the game
All I hang around is zeroes figure my checks should look the same

[Chorus]

[Mike G]
Yo, got the money, fuck the bitches
Ain't gotta do it for long, I'm just tryin to get you on
Might not make sense, but I'm just a pimp bitch
