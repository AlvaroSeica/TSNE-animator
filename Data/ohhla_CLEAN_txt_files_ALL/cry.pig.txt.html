wait wait wait wait, wait wait

(chorus)

I feel so good I wanna cry (4x)
he took my seeds and multiply
then took my needs and supplied
wiped off the tears of both my eyes
I said I feel so good I wanna cry

There once was a time that my very eyes could not see
stumblin' over rocks that were right in front of me
but now that the cold is done, and my window's open wide
I spot all my enemies, that envy behind the skies

And baby butter it's on like a baton 
flippin' into the don, new breed to be, plus a brand new speed
like a bird, up in the air with new rings, a new born baby
touchin' new things, simple as that, brand new format
ready? Attack, bloody new baby in a mercedes ,the bitch's black
and calm and gruntin' ??? at one thing pushin' passed you
with the mischievioust grin

(chorus)

And baby butter I'm leavin now, all the past, the good and the bad
hear me now, when I got need to pull along, somethin' is gone
when I'm trying to write books compare it to songs
I'm a live right now, stop callin' the girls, especially the fly ones
with those curls, I'm tellin' the truth, you want some proof
go into you, how many verges rilly hangin' on with the truth?
niggy, it's hard on the boulevard, well we gotta make it, b-
come superstars, you know you feel this, no matter who you are
cuz you can't run when you're unloadin' the car, dedicated to my friends
who do heroin, they be lookin' for the peace but it's very thin 
trying to grab reality and make it bend, but it only breaks in th end

(chorus)

There once was a time that my very eyes could not see
stumblin' over rocks that were right in front of me
but now that the cold is done, and my window's open wide
I spot all my enemies, that envy behind the skies

now all I do is work to pay rent, in the studio
got another show, going on the road, another cheque sent
hangin' out with bro's, turnin' into pro's, learnin' how to soul?
replacin' my rent, let it all go, turn it into mo', let my chap low  
a drive in my mint, buy one dollar clothes, practicin' my flows
undip and unload
