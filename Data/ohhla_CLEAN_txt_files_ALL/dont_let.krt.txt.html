[Intro: Big K.R.I.T.]
Yeah, see, they wonder why we ride high, why we get high
Shit, it's just to get by
See some days, sometimes, this world lets you down
And you can't do nothing but fall, so I'm hollering out

[Chorus]
Don't let me down (don't let me down)
Don't let me down (don't let me down)
Don't let me down (don't let me down)
Don't let me down (uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-ohhh)
Don't let me down

[Big K.R.I.T.]
See we've been going through some thangs
Police hit the block and make it hard for us to hang
My girl bitch cause all I ever do is swang and bang
Pouring up, I swear my liver'll never be the same
A pint of Hen'll get me in and help to ease the pain
The world fucked up and I can't seem to leave the game
So I continue bending corners, bitches switching lanes
Ain't tripping on the sun, sometimes I'd rather feel the rain
Get high to maintain, so don't let me down

[Chorus]

[Big K.R.I.T.]
I made some plays that I regret, but that's just how it be
I lost some friends, fucked up some money, but stayed on my feet
I did all I could in my city, so I had to bounce
I signed my deal and got more haters than I care to count
But I can't fault them for their feelings, cause I know the score
It's hard to celebrate for others when you're dying poor
So I keep rolling low-key, dolo, trying not to stunt
I crank my system till it's clipping, then I let it thump
Put all my problems in my cup while I grip the wheel
There's too much money to be had, I ain't sitting still
A country boy trying to make these petty ends meet
I learned my lesson, can't trust niggas cause they envy
Can't stop no show, I'm bout this dough, and that's all I can say
Thank God for everything, I could have died like yesterday
Make room for me in case my plane just ain't meant to fly
I hope you there if I fall from the sky, hollering out don't let me down

[Chorus]</pre>
