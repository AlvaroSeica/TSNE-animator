Song:   I've Got Your Man
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Your Man, He Told Me That He's Tired Of The Shit You Got
He Took One Hit And Said My Good Shit Keeps Him Comin Back
He Likes It Tight And Said Your Shit Is Just A Little Slack
Girl Dont Get Mad At Me, I'm Only Telling You The Fact

[Chorus]
I Got Your Man And You Can't Do Anything About It
You May Think He Is Comin' Back To You But.. I Doubt It
Don't Make No Sense, You Even Call Ur Man, Try To Work Out It
'cause I Got Your Man And You Can't Do Anything About It

He Told Me You Don't Give Him Room Nor Give Him Breathing Space
And When He's Out With Friends You Call And Get Up On His Case
He Wants A Girl That's Down And Cool, Not All Up In His Face
That's Why I'm Here With Him Cause I'm About To Take Your Place

[Chorus]
I Got Your Man And You Can't Do Anything About It
You May Think He Is Comin' Back To You But.. I Doubt It
Don't Make No Sense, You Even Call Your Man, Try To Work Out It
Cause' I Got Your Man And You Can't Do Anythin' About It

[Reggae]
This Is A Lesson And A Lesson You Will Learn
Take Care Of Your Man Or Else You Lose Your Turn
Respect Your Man And Then Your Respect Return
This A Little Sign, You Might Go Get Burned
Notice When He Don't Come Home On Time
[?]
You Might Have An Extra Lover In Mind, But ..

[Chorus]
I Got Your Man And You Cant Do Anything About It
You May Think He Is Comin' Back To You But, I Doubt It
Don't Make No Sense, You Even Call Your Man, Try To Work Out It
Cause' I Got Your Man And You Can't Do Anythin' About It

Your Man, He Told Me That He's Tired Of The Shit You Got
He Took One Hit And Said My Good Shit Keeps Him Comin Back
He Likes It Tight And Said, Ur Shit Is Just A Lil Slack
Girl Dont Get Mad At Me, Im Only Telling You The Facts

[Chorus: x2]
I Got Your Man And You Can't Do Anything About It
You May Think He Is Comin' Back To You But, I Doubt It
Don't Make No Sense, You Even Call Ur Man, Try To Work Out It
'cause I Got Your Man And You Can't Do Anythin' About It</pre>
