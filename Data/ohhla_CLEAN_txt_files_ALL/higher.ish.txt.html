[Chorus]
We plot and we plan, but everything's controlled by higher powers
No matter how much you hate it, its evident and its blatant
We plot and we plan, but everything's controlled by higher powers
No matter if you don't like it, there ain't no way you can fight it

[Verse 1]
There ain't no way that you know what you gon' be doing day to day
You might get laid with strays, from some beef that was down the way
And you had nothing to do with it, and now you leaking fluids kid
Your arm blown out the socket, doctor telling you you losing it
Confusing it with movies, they still refuse to believe it
Till the truck jackknifes in front of you while you speeding and you can't weave it
Now you out of luck and out of choices, only seconds left
You gasp, but everything happens too fast to catch a second breath
Or a mother's life ambition, for her son to go to college
Shattered by a nameless bullet in a act of random violence
Perpetrated by his childhood friend he used to go outside with
Now he lay silent with a hole in his chest, and open eyelids
A blowout on a highway can probably make you late
But a blowout on a icy bridge can have you and your kids in the lake
And your family at your wake, praying over your casket
His son didnt make that trip, so I guess hes a lucky bastard

[Chorus]
We plot and we plan, but everything's controlled by higher powers
No matter how much you hate it, its evident and its blatant
We plot and we plan, but everything's controlled by higher powers
No matter if you don't like it, there ain't no way you can fight it

We plot and we plan, but everything's controlled by higher powers
Just as sure as the seasons change, everything happens for a reason
We plot and we plan, but everything's controlled by higher powers
Any second your life could change, if its sunny you might get rain

[Verse 2]
There ain't no way around the fact, whether you white or brown or black
That any moment, any second, any day could be your last
I knew this cat thats very talented in basketball, in fact
He could have went to any college in the nation on his stats
Who would have known that after practice, in the gym next to the track
That he would suddenly collapse and perish from a heart attack
Or a healthy child that was born through the pain of maternal labor
To pass away in his sleep in his bed, three days later
And there ain't no explanation, even after investigation
God I guess wanted to keep him away from Satan's temptations
So he called him back, whats wrong with that? We won't see him tomorrow
Though we know hes in a better place we still live with the sorrow
People ask me how I'm feeling, what I'm doing, I'm chillin'
But before I say what I'ma do I tell em, "God willin'"
Cause I never know whats gonna happen, one day you're here
And the next day you're gone, and the cycle just keeps moving along

[Chorus]
We plot and we plan, but everything's controlled by higher powers
No matter how much you hate it, its evident and its blatant
We plot and we plan, but everything's controlled by higher powers
No matter if you don't like it, there ain't no way you can fight it

We plot and we plan, but everything's controlled by higher powers
Just as sure as the seasons change, everything happens for a reason
We plot and we plan, but everything's controlled by higher powers
Any second your life could change, if its sunny you might get rain

[Verse 3]
Got off the bus with smiling faces, cause school was really live today
And now I'm trying to change my clothes so I can go outside and play
I went inside, my mom is heated, cause when she's mad, she don't smirk
I told a joke, she asked me if I brought home any homework
I said "Naw, its Friday, and after school its my day
And I want to go outside and spend the rest of it my way"
She said, not before you take out the trash and sweep the floor
I thought that wasn't fair cause that's one of my sister's chores
I'm sorta heated, cause I'm trying to get with my mans
Everything was set, my mom was the only wrench in my plans
We was going to the river today, steal boats and ride em
I jumped on my bike as quick as I can, to try to find em
I'm all pissed off at my moms, its about 5:21
By the time I make it down there I'm gonna miss all the fun
When I finally got there, its like 6 and a quarter
Shocked, as I watched the cops drag my friends' bodies out of the water

[Chorus]
We plot and we plan, but everything's controlled by higher powers
No matter how much you hate it, its evident and its blatant
We plot and we plan, but everything's controlled by higher powers
No matter if you don't like it, there ain't no way you can fight it

We plot and we plan, but everything's controlled by higher powers
Just as sure as the seasons change, everything happens for a reason
We plot and we plan, but everything's controlled by higher powers
Any second your life could change, if its sunny you might get rain</pre>
