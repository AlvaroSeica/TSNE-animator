Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus 1: Mob Doll]
I said I been smoking since monday
Maybe I'll quit someday
I stay smoking til sunday
I told you I'm in love with that dro oh oh
I'm in love with that dro oh ooh

I'm so in love with that dro
I'm so in love with that dro
I love waking up
Love waking up
Waking up with that dro
I'm blowing on that smoke so much
My room is full of that smoke
I said I'm on my way
With an ounce of caviar gold
Got some Hennessy in my cup with ice
And I'm mixing it with coke
Got a tattoo of a strap
That a-k's my logo
Mob life I'm repping
All of my crew is getting that doe
Don't care what they say about it
Cause you know who's running the show

[Verse 1: L.A Gun Smoke]
Uh let me split that, lick that
You gon' let me hit that?
I been trying to hit back then
I was with that one bitch kick back
I was trying to fuck you
We could smoke about a blunt or 2
I'm a fuck with you
You gon' bring your friends
They can fuck the crew
What you wanna do?
I been trying to fuck with you
Baby let me roll this weed
We could smoke another..

[Chorus 2: Mob Doll]
I said I been smoking since monday
Maybe I'll quit someday
I stay smoking til sunday
I told you I'm in love with that dro oh oh
I'm in love with that dro oh ooh

I'm with the crew on friday
Friday night is my day
Everyone's at my place
And you can catch us smoking that dro oh oh
Catch us smoking that dro oh ooh

[Verse 2: King Lil G]
Waking up &amp; we light it up
And we slowly blinking
I'm high as fuck
Your man keeps calling you
Keep ignoring
I'm looking forward to another blunt
Yeah we living that fast life
Had a different girl last night
You could smell it when you pass by
Double n-i-n-e company
She could ride with me
If she act right
Surrounded by all of the killers
The illest words
Be the ones that i"m spittin'
Just hit the herb
Reminiscin' of her
And maybe her dirty biz
That sucios mob
Rolling up purple
I'm a g star
Hitting that weed with the team
While I'm bumping this beat
Through the cali streets all week long
When I die make sure they bury me a legend
It's probably true
I walked up took your favorite rappers necklace
I'm young &amp; I'm reckless
Chilled with your ex's
My baby mama's in cali
My new girl is in texas

[Chorus]

[Outro]
[coughs]
Man that some bomb ass weed (weed)
When I went to portland, oregon
They had some bomb ass weed homie
Shout out to denver, colorado that mile high
They got some bomb weed too
Washington: reno, nevada got some bomb weed too though
And I'm out</pre>
