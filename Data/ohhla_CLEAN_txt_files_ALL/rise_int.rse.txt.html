What's your name?
Rise
Risen
Who are you?
Rise
Risen
La la la la la

[Verse One]
(What are you?)
I am the truth
I got the true sound
I am so loose
I got the juice now
I'm on the roof, burnin' the roof down
I am the shit, catch me, I'm it clown
Cause
While rappin'
No one's style's matchin'
My sickest style's rations for the mental crowd gaspin'
I'm call purist
But I Am Legend
The last man standing, immune and still testin'
I am the cure
I was never signed like a lore
But never think that I am obscure
I am the tour
I am so sure, that my mind knows the ?
Put up your rich and diss me as I bet you my poor
I over 
Ambitious
And over man bitches
And over tan britches I wear to the man's business
For my fan fixes of another man's sickness
I'ma chant scriptures
And yeah it's your man Risen

[Chorus]
You'll try while I'm alive til I chill in the skies
But you'll never find anybody iller than Rise
You can try while I'm alive til I live in the skies
But you'll never find anybody iller than Rise
You can try while I'm alive until I chill in the skies
But you'll never find anybody iller than Rise
You can sigh, you thought I died but I'm Risen alive (I'm back)
You'll never find anybody iller than Rise
