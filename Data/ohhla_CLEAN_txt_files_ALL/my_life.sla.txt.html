[Intro: Cee-Lo Green]
This is my motherfucking life, my life! Oh yeah
This is my motherfucking life, my life! Oh yeah
This is my motherfucking life

[Crooked I]
Ay; S-L-A-,U-G-H-,T-E-R-H-O-U-S-E
Yes we are the best in the biz
The West in this bitch, this Eastside L.B.
Money over coochie mayne
645 when I dip through the 'burbs
I be on my Gucci Mane
Smash in the gas, kick a bitch to the curb
House on the hills, thousands and mil's
Gettin wild in the field with your spouse in Brazil
On ounces and pills, how does it feel
to count dollar bills that I pound off, skills
Check it out - jets, fly, pri-vate
Nigga S-5, hy-brid, baby test, drive, my, whip
I'm in Bed-Stuy, with my, chick
On my West, side, fly, shit
Pullin out minks when the weather get +Chilly+
+Left-Eye+, side-kick
Huh, now don't you niggaz go chasin "Waterfalls"
These bitches wall to wall
And they love them Slaughter balls

[Chorus: Cee-Lo Green] + (Crooked I)
This is my motherfucking life, my life! Oh yeah
This is my motherfucking life, my life! Oh yeah
(Jets, fly, pri-vate, nigga S-5, hy-brid, baby test, drive, my)
This is my motherfucking life, my life! Oh yeah
(Jets, fly, pri-vate, nigga S-5, hy-brid, baby test, drive, my, whip)
This is my motherfucking life, my life! Oh yeah
This is my motherfucking life

[Joell Ortiz]
Uhh, sometimes I look around and I just
I just can't believe it (why?)
I'm on a high like a falsetto
Maybe that's why I feel like I'm dreamin
My eyes is clear, look what I'm seein
My life just shifted, I feel like I'm breathin
Light that spliff, nah I don't even smoke 
cause it burn my throat but tonight I'm steamin
'Trón in my cup, holdin mine up
Toastin with a slut that I know I'm gon' fuck
In these five-star sheets put her right to sleep 
then kick the bitch out when I wake up
Even though baby girl got a large ol' ass
I remember prayin that my car goes last
And my car's so fast 
I don't think you understand in a Marciélago dash
At first when you rap in the dirt and you work 'til it hurt 
and you end up on Marshall's staff
Hopin that your granny get to see you at the Grammy's
Get a call from your family that your grandma passed
And you know what you promised her 
so you stay hot as a, thermometer dipped in lava
So proud to be part of a, conglomerate - like this!

[Chorus]

[Cee-Lo Green] + (Crooked I)
Oh-oh-oh-oh; every time that they crave us
Put your hands up high if, you're happy you made iiiiit
Oh-oh-oh-oh; you're still asleep when I say it
But since I'm alive I'm, just gon' celebraaaaaaaate
Yeahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Oh-oh-oh-oh; yeahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
(Jets, fly, pri-vate, nigga S-5, hy-brid, baby test, drive, my)
This is my motherfucking life

[Joe Budden]
Uhh, what a success story
The film plays it gets less gory
My son didn't know who his pop was for years, now it's less Maury
God, put it there as a test for me
Used to, walk around with a vest at 40
Cops tryna mess hall me
Now babe with the 34 F's adore me
I took the rock and a hard place and made the best orgy
Now the fans approach, I get paranoid
Where I'm from they told me never let your guard rest
But it's simple to disregard stress
Hoes run to the bone and they far, fetched

[Royce Da 5'9"]
Uhh - now the jets, fly, high shit
That Panamera Porsche that's Ry-an's, fly, whip
As a kid I was po', playin tag now I'm, it (it)
For those of y'all that don't remember me
I'm a Detroit, Oak Park-er
Went from no office to offers 
and told y'all I'ma get my daddy out the post office
And so far I don't really need to own my city 
just as long as the D is on my fitted
And my sons and my daughter and the wife is along for the ride 
cause it's the motherfuckin life

[Chorus]</pre>
