Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Talking: Lil B]
Hey Baby, You know what the fuck it is
Lil B in this motherfucker
RED FLAME
Yea, Shouts out to my girlfriend, you know what's up baby
Yea

[Chorus]
I'm Miley Cyrus, I'm Miley Cyrus
Sorry Miley Cyrus, I'm Miley Cyrus
Cyrus, Cyrus I'm Miley Cyrus
Cyrus, Cyrus, I'm Miley Cyrus

[Verse 1]
Left hand Cyrus, right hand iced out
All the girls love me, all the guys hate me
Right hand Cyrus, girlfriend Cyrus
Driving no license
Tucan Sam, ice chain ultra-violet
Young Based God used to date MIley Cyrus
I look like Paris Hilton, chain Ellen DeGeneres, ring Mel Gibson, chain Jessica Simpson

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 2]
Where's Trey Cyrus, I'm on the waterfront
Real hood shawty, swaged up to the maximum
I'm in the suburbs, walking no security
Left hand Cyrus, girls love my jewelery
Right hand Cyrus, young based Cyrus
Young Based God, and my girl Miley Cyrus
Bentley Coupe driving, ten thousand diamonds
I'm Miley Cyrus, PARTY IN THE USA, Oh My God

[Chorus: end to fade]</pre>
