[Jason]
Yo Slug, it's your first man
Hey, haha, dude it's raining outside
And umm, I'm waiting on you motherfucker again
Nobody's answering their phone
And ah, I'm waiting van packed up
Ready to roll, we're checked out of the hotel
All I need is rappers and DJs to get in the fucking van
So please man, hurry the fuck up
Cats Van Bags! Yo Cali</pre>
