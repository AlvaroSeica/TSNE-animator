Fumbling over words that rhyme [x4]

[Verse 1]
Mad rap user, game made under pressure
Expose the jewel teeth, school at my leisure
Fumble over words that rhyme with a verse divine
I backtrack and think of the greatest of all-time
Class is in session, master this lesson
Teacher was a student, studied like a Buddhist
But few went on the best to do it
So let's do this

[Drum Break]

Nothin' to it
Considered the first emcee to blow the spot
and do what was Coke La Rock spittin' for Kool Herc
Followin' the influence and heard from more parties
Brothas like Cowboy made you move your body
Cowboy would toast for the G and Flash
And his skills elevated as crews started to clash
Flash and Bam, they both saw clientele
So Flash formed the Four with the father Melle Mel
Four became Five, more became live
Routines on the breaks, crew kings motivate
After L the brothers became Fantastic
With Theodore they battled the Cold Crush Four
Few had the confidence of G. MC
Without the CCB's [Cold Crush Brothers] there'd be no Run-DMC
The Funky and the Fearless Four forced emcees to small Spoonie G
And I can't forget the Treacherous Three MC's

[Hook]

[Verse 2]

"Props to the Kool Moe Dee, he elevated
and changed the r-records like the new rap language
Before the first four length LP's
There was abstract brothas like the one from LZ
Run DMC broke crew in '83
Outta Queens, started rapping hard over drum machines
808's started shakin' up floors ["The World is Yours" Sample]
We takin' rock's complex metaphors ["T La Rock" Sample]
A primary influence on L.L. Cool J
T La Rock's futurism must've been respectable
'Cuz Tragedy from Queens was young but very technical
Sham was eloquent, Chris was intelligent
The 'R' was all of the above with added elements
Slick Rick the Ruler was a street-made producer
Ultramagnetic had the vision for the future
Big Daddy Kane getting raw at The Appolo and
Kool G Rap was probably the sickest of all of them
Jaz from the BK, Mercy and Finesse from the BX
Prince Paul and Pharoe came next
Wu with the G-Z-A, C-F-K
N-A-S one of the best out to date
Any MC that's added on to the list
Pump your fist, but first give praise to the true scientists
