Yes, I am drunk, aaaand I'm proud of it
There was a show last night and it was off the hizzle for bliggle
And we did some cocaine and some methamphetamines

{There's no room for hotdogs on my desk anymore! You see that?}
{What's wrong with you? You gotta start makin mooneeey!}
I'm sorry! I'm tryin the best I possibly can! I'm just one man!
Have you heard the new songs man? You heard the skits?
{Yeah, but the songs stinks! And the skits are costin too much cheddar maaan!}
We, we need those skits they break up the monotony of the music
and people come to exp...
{I don't get the whole skit thing, frankly they're not funny
{They're NOT funny} It's funny aaaand people love 'em
{It's just references; who's getting these references?}
A lot of people are! Everybody gets
when you hear something you've heard before that's comedyyyy!
{No, that's not comedy}
{The songs you're writing now are garbage - everybody hates them}
What are you talkin about? They're hilarious!
{You gotta get back to your roots}
{What was that song everybody liked?} "Hijack?"
{No! The song, that everybody liked}
{It was popular. People quoted it} "Tussin"
{Tussin?! No! What the hell is Tussin?}
{It was the song about the guy from Star Wars in his car...}
"Fett's Vette" - "Fett's Vette"

Look at me in the eyes! "It's Fett's Vette!"
{What was it?} "Fett's Vette!"
{Yeah, Fett's Vette, that's it}
{You gotta write more songs like Fett's Vette}
{Come on, there were like twelve bounty hunters on that super star destroyer}

{It's not played out, what am I tellin you here?
{You gotta write more songs about bounty hunters from Star Wars, in vehicles}

{They are great ideas, listen}
{If you put "Bossk on a Segway," you gonna sell records!}
{Now let me cleverly use that to segue to my next point to you}

{Keep fightin me, see where it gets ya - get out there!}
