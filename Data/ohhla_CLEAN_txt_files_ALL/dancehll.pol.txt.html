[Dirt Gritie]               
See the dancehall queen on the floor with a bag a men 
Them a kill the tune so I'm a put the dagger in 
Shorty like my swagger and the way that I strut 
So she rewards me and put my hand on her butt
Her tummy it did a tuck tossed her legs up 
Eyes pop outta their sockets just like what 
But this is just the average 
Inna Da Dance we speak in body languages
Punk Rock, Rock Steady, I Swear 
Unu Nah Behave Inna Da Dance my dear 
But this is why we're here a night with no fear 
To get away from all the stress out there
 
[First Chorus 1X - Oozeela]
The bass a pound upon the speaker (That is we)
Music is part of our feature (That is we)
Jamaica, St. Vincent, and Dominica (That is we)
It's a West Indian thing
When the calilou cook up on the pot (That is we)
Then you know this here pepper is hot (That is we)
King Khan, Oozeela, Poli Rock we ago raise the temperature 
(Raise the temperature)

[Arlo Maverick]                    
Influenced by Stone Love, Black Chiney and Roses
The art of selecting centers on the closeness
Between tunes, and it's safe to assume
Air horns a prelude, every bloodclot tune
Head to head, dub plate for dub plate
It's more than just songs, it's more than just crates
Some dance to make memories, some to escape
Some trance so the melody takes them to a place
Where they don't watch face, but man a watch waist
Of the brown skill girls in fraks of pure lace
As speakers vibrate, we play for high stakes
But a me kill sound, it can't be my fate, no
 
[Second Chorus 1X - Oozeela]        
Thunder pound upon the speaker (That is we)
Music is part of our feature (That is we)
St. Lucia, Guadeloupe, and Martinique (That is we)
It's a West Indian thing
Trinidad, Grenada, Barbados (That is we)
Bahamas and Turks and Caicos (That is we)
Roti and Curry on the stove we ago raise the temperature 
(Raise the temperature)
 
[Bridge 1X - Oozeela]
We keep raising 
Up, Up, Up, Up, Up
Up, Up, Up, Up, Up
Up, Up, Up, Up, Up
Up, Up, Up, Up, Up
 
Up, Up, Up, Up, Up
Up, Up, Up, Up, Up
Up, Up, Up, Up, Up
Up, Up, Up, Up, Up
Up, Up, Up, Up, Up
 
[King Khan]
