[Chorus 2X: Twista]
Twista been comin with fast lyrics for years
I'm glad to see niggaz catch up to speed (okay)
But when it come to doin an intricate pattern 
I bet you y'all could never fuck with me (no way)
Cause when it come to this music I am a Mobsta, I am a G (I am a G)
And when it come to this rap shit then I am a monster, I am a beast

[Twista]
Never let negative energy interfere with this
I be from the outer limits and I devour timid haters 
that intend to annihilate what I put together
They don't wanna do what I got from of the military
And they wanna question if I am a lyricist
I would murder 'em with the dialect of an apostle
I'm apocalyptic and I can kick it whichever way you wanna hear it
Ain't no tellin who I'ma kill and bury
How could you fuck with a nigga willin to kill 'em all?
With the ability to body a brigade of motherfuckers 
that come with the ruckus who ruin any anatomy
Whoever stretegy you will try to initiate
Theoretically I'm the cypher that's infinite
In other words I'm immortal, I came through a portal 
and one day I'ma go back and tell 'em how them niggaz'll hate on me
cause I kept a circle and will not affiliate
Ain't impossible nigga, I go the whole yard
Ain't no law with my continuum, my minimum is forever and ever 
so nigga you wanna do it don't really matter to me
Let's handle it right now
What happened to goin and pullin a nigga hoe card?
Fuck all the thuggin on the internet cause I'm not into that
I'm on a higher intellect and I don't wanna catch a murder
cause I know that it's possible that you might die

[Chorus]

[Twista]
Now they be tellin me "Twista, come with the hard shit"
I don't wanna disappoint 'em so I gotta get it in to kill 'em 
with every syllable after syllable like a gorilla do
when I beat 'em at a physical
I be knowin the way I spit it be God's gift
Cause I'm feelin so bad when I fuck a nigga up
It's an immaculate conception of somethin immortal 
when the proportion of destruction is biblical
Like Isaiah, Deuteronomy and Leviticus
I be a lyrical prophet
I'm a disciple with a rifle, I'm like John the Baptist
My raps is a revelation of the genesis of your downfall
I'm a playa, you should follow me cause I'm infamous
And my flow is off the chain, I be rappin about somethin holy 
then I talk about your body bein cut up in pieces
out on the premises when they found y'all
You gotta give me the status of bein a legend
In my continuum what I be givin 'em be killin 'em 
and everybody feelin 'em, I'm colder than December
I'm a symbol and I make 'em remember my emblem
I hit you with the automatic and see you in heaven
Committed a verbal murder
We heard the surgery wasn't a success when you was in the hospital
So if I ever get charged I hope that I'ma get the minimum

[Chorus]

[Twista - repeat 2X]
Now there'll be no killin of Twista cause I'm the omnipotent (omnipotent)
But most of them niggaz just hate on me cause I flow different (different)
Like the way that I spit a verse to get in a nigga ass
Intricate patterns of intelligently spoken words 
killin my enemy off with the dialect of Chicago and I'ma blast</pre>
