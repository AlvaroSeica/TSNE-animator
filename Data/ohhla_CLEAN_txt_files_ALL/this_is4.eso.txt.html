[Verse 1: Bliss]
Yo, from half a headphone as a mic and a busted boombox
To rockin' the spot from Sydney to the fuckin' boondocks
To the fans when we pass through who love to wave high (hey)
To the arms that hold me up when I jump and stage-dive
To kids outside the venue who ain't on the door list
They love the music, they just can't afford it
Watch them build that cypher smiling quite glad
Why aren't they glum, what you dumb?
cos hip hop has no price tag
And everybody's welcome, it has no nationality
This is for rappers who ain't just in it for the fast salary
Who don't just push violence and money with all that damn braggin'
Who don't just jump on the ("it's all entertainment") bandwagon
To the dj who drops his tune and ain't paid to play it
To anyone who loves their partner and ain't afraid to say it
To everyone who's shown love when I looked unsure
Friends and fam, shit even the girls I boofed on tour man

[Hook] {X2}
This is for you, you're the reason I wrote this
You're the reason I stand in the rain and get my clothes wet
Oh it's just another taste from the bottle
Oh it's Bliss N Eso's page from the novel

[Verse 2: Eso] 
Keep your cash, your gold, your glitter and cars
Keep your royal red carpet for your city of stars
This ain't for the system to put a cage on your mind
It's for those who don't suck dick for radio time
And the only time you'll ever catch me aimin' a rifle
is when there's nothing on my telly but *Australian Idol*
We rock rusty mics, and spit what we think
Shabby hotel hoppers that piss in the sink
See cos rich make money and poor make magic
("We're gonna make you a star") bro they all say that shit
A habit for the headphones (kid's ride the merry-go)
'round down to meet me (inside the stereo)
With no Ride, and no meals full of shrimp
I'm broke, but hip-hop can make me feel like a pimp
See the man who lives patient handles displacement
Writing rhymes for you in a candlelit basement

[Hook] {X2}

[Verse 3: Bliss then Eso]
This is for the cause in the music, the gift that we're building
We all gotta use it for lifting these children
I haven't been the same since I fell in the well
I wished and found love where them matey aliens dwell
See it's the rhymes, it's the beat
It's the song, it's the mix
It's the times that we're free
It's the bomb, it's the shit
Opportunity's blind I don't wonder if he's coming
So look mum, no hands - I made somethin' outta nothin'

[Hook] {X2}

And I hope this feeling stays till tomorrow! {X3}</pre>
