(*talking*)
Hey Rocko, what it do, shit word
On the streets, motherfuckers
Say we ain't as raw as we use to be
Or ain't got it like we use to have it
Them motherfuckers must ain't peeped them
Last two albums, for real, dick riders

[Hook - 2x]
All you hoes, talking down
Guard your grill, keep moving around
On the real, it's going down
Fucking with us, you'll be laying it down

[Trae]
I'm finna to make you feel my wrath
Fucking guerilla niggaz, living the stretch
Ready to bust all of my enemies
When they living the life so shife, and knowing it ain't right
How the fuck did you leave a nigga with love, out to dry
Man I thought that we was suppose to shed blood for eachother
Get on the grind, and break bread with eachother
And now you wanna plex, and you keeping it undercover
I'm a hundred percent real, ain't never gon be another
Nigga like me, can you imagine what I be going through
When a nigga starts to go bad, and niggaz wanna turn around
So now I'm walking around, strapped with a frown
Move around, bitch it's fin to go down
It ain't gon be no more talking down, you walking a thin line
Cause now the Underdawg, gon make a nigga respect mine
You don't really wanna know, what's going on inside mine
You an't fuck around, until you deal with a flat line
Guerilla Maab for life, and that's my word
On the verge of doing a nigga raw
You better believe I'm gonna make it regardless, what a nigga say
And ain't too many niggaz, that'll fuck around with the Trae
I'm one of a kind, I stay on the grind I gotta get mine
Me and Rocko and Dougie, all them niggaz hate that
Better get on the corner, thinking you better back back
Fore' I street sweep the block, with a guerilla attack
Nigga tell me how you love that, I'ma surviving nigga
That's never gonna turn back, blessed with a tact
To make a nigga wanna feel that, living effect
A lot of y'all can't take that, gotta pray to God
I'll forever be strong, until the end of my living
When I'm giving I'm all alone, Lord no doubt
I wanna fall off in my zone, cause too many niggaz
Making a nigga wanna do wrong, you better be gone

[Hook - 2x]

[Dougie D]
I'ma put it to you motherfuckers, having no rest
Snapping necks, a motherfucker that be bumping they gums
Talk down, making motherfuckers move round
You moving too fast, you make a halt, hold up and slow down
Fa sho now, steady be rocking steady, we jamming it with this
We touch, we still slamming the bitch
Take time for a nigga to shine, and get rich
In the meanwhile, I'ma collect all my chips
Putting it in they motherfucking face, mm-hm
Thought we was gon give up, now bitch what
Dougie and Trae, a cold coming at you on display
And breaking em off, is the Guerilla Maab way
Do I really wanna play game, ah naw
Come in we gon stop, and press pause
Breaking a jaw and fade the law, and do it raw
Teaching motherfuckers a lesson, that they never saw
They gon learn by that, gripping a glock now tilt they hats back
Fucking with us, get your man some contact
Better believe that every word I say, look bitch I meant that
I'll ride on a hoe, keep my gun on squat and get throwed
Ain't nothing but Dougie, Trae and Rocko doing what we do
Up on the low-low, fa sho though, you know
That it's gon go down, keeping it crunk, blow up and shake round
Fuck boys up, and make they hoe mine
Just let pussy marks, lay it on down
Better believe it, I'm run right in it, just won't stop until I get finished
Bumping lips, they always get splitted, and when they get splitted
You know we done did it, talking on down get you hit in a minute

[Hook - 4x]

All you hoes, talking down
You gonna be laying it down
On the real, it's going down
You gonna be laying it down

All you hoes, talking down
On the real, it's going down
You gonna be laying it down</pre>
