Man... I'm so tired of my life right now
Got stacks and stacks of bills...
Got bill collectors calling me, harassing me everyday...
They even call me by my nickname now
People ask me what's wrong
I just tell them I got the Williams
Y'all feel me

[Chorus] 2X
I wish that I could have a second chance
Take it all away and just call it a day
But I got bills, problems, all in my way
What more can I say?
I got the Williams

All my life they told me, "save your money for a rainy day"
But I always end up buying things that take the pain away
From the bills that I can't afford
permanent credit reports
the rent that I turned in
landlord said it was short
I'm staring at a stack of past due bills
Wishin I could repossess my own dreams
Every time the phone rings
Bills collectors calling and constantly coming after you
I changed my voice so many times, they think I'm Supernatural
I said I pay you next week
Talk about it when we next speak
The way you bill collectors call it's difficult to get sleep
You on the phone begging me for money like you desperate
All you do is look at papers you sit at the fuckin desk with
I owe you for the bank loan
I'm sorry if I spent it black
if you don't want this fifty bucks I'll mail it till you send it back
temptation really got the best of me for once
now my car payments backed up at least three months
Damn

[Chorus] 2X

I wish I never had to see another day job, or punch another clock
Or beg the boss so I can go to lunch at twelve o'clock
I've been slaving overtime here a hell of a whole lot
Man, this ain't me, that's what I keep telling my own pops
I been working at the same place
movin at the same pace
dealin with these rednecks, I gotta keep a same face
game face on, I need to get a raise to get paid
Instead my supervisor warning me about my sick days
I need some credit for the days that I work
I've walked around this hellhole with my name on my shirt
Dusty and dirty everyday, I need to lease my respect
Cause child support's already reaching for a piece of my check
You think it's funny, but I'm serious
There's things we need to talk about
If I don't get my raise soon, I swear to God I'm walking out
Cause y'all awfully late, I tell you what man
I'm clocking out and goin home, soon as I come home for break

[Chorus] 4X

Yo, I'm tired of changing my voice on the phone man
These bill collectors really breaking a nigga down right now
Hell, my bills so old... I'm starting to call him William now
Oh y'all don't laugh, cuz some of y'all got the Williams too
I know, it's a shame right?
I got the Williams
Just quit my job man
Ayo Nicolay, we gon need a platinum plaque for this one
I pay for these bills, pay for this studio time
Hell, pay for these beats man
Yea, I got the Williams...</pre>
