Represent Who
Represent What
Represent Who
Represent What
Represent Africa with a spectacular street vernacular
Represent Who
Represent What

[VERSE 1]

Who woulda knew that this cat from Africa
Would come to America
Verbally massacre these characters
Never no passenger
I cruise in the driver's seat
Cadillacs, hoopties, Buicks, still doing it
Rap is like the ice-cream truck
Kids pursuin' it
Media's confusin' it
White boys consumin' it
Me I pick a spoon and 
Scoop a little soul in it
Master P with the flow, yo there's no limit
No gimmick, stay on point like Chauncey Billups
These arrows from my Bowe like Riddick
The critics say I spit it so different
Scorpio intense
Ghanaian presence definin' the essence
Ancestors blessed us beyond measure
Deliver lyrical treasure like AZ in the golden era
Written, off the top, on beat, or acappella
Every line, every rhyme relevant forever
In the name of Mandela
Masakela, Makeba
Oral traditions in a flavor you can savor
We never gave up
True warriors, vainglorious
It's obvious the gift is upon us

[CHORUS]

Whatever happened to rappin' without mentionin' a gun clappin'
Or gun clappin' without mentionin' in one's rappin'
I never been to Uncle Tom's Cabin
But I've met many a Shaman that's proud to be African
From the womb to the tomb
Were we destined for doom, NO
We do it big like a Sumo
Beats by B-Live make me feel alive
I'm from a mixed tribe
Coastally inclined
The ocean waves we ride
Our fisherman got Nets like New Jersey
12 year olds  carry big breasts like they 23
33 year olds got ass Europeans' envy
Skin ranges from jet black to chocolate ebony
Hot damn black Queen you heavenly!
Still understand I'm only a man
Don't stand adjacent to my frustration
Steady telling me ÒDon't fuck with her, she CaucasianÓ
With all sincerity, you hate
When I approach you with levity
Build a strong family
Let's enjoy each other's company
Stop with the bickerin' and build some harmony
These bills need to be paid
So when I open a new page
To script these lines
Don't show your rage
Like Cheney I'm a dick sometimes
But when the stars align
I pen these lines
It's so divine
News from the African Times

[CHORUS]

This the 3rd
You can eff what you heard in the second and the first
It gets worse
It's so puzzlin' it hurts worse
Than standin' on pins and needles
Or catchin' the measles
Learnin' like that cat from the Beatles

So damn Don Cheadle cuz my thoughts crash
Jumpin' around like everlast
Ghana to Rwanda
Tanzania Uganda
All the way to the horn
Other places war-torn
[spoken interlude]
[rhymes underneath]
I represent till my last breath is gone
Baptize mics like my name was john
Even Cheech and Chong would get high off this song
For sure, I represent for the black and poor
The malnourished who aint never heard of christian diour
Stoaways that risk their lives to see new york
It's a deadly voyage, Danny Glover couldn't fathom
But still we hold rythmn hostage, demand ransom
And spazz out, throw trantrums in my new habitat
Minneapolis, guns go ratatatat
I came in the door
With raw metaphors of course
I'm down for the law
I'm down by cause
Haha,
That shit right
[Represent
With a spectacular vernacular]
I represent Africa strictly
