Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Ya left me
I'm like I don't know why
Ya came back
And gave it another try
But I'm caught up
And I will add it's a lie
So we stop...
And now we're sayin bye bye

If ya want me to kill
I would
If ya want me to steal
I would
If ya want me to love ya
I could
But we're so misunderstood

Me and you together ain't really good anyway
We could break up or just break out in a heated argument on any given day
I'm impossible
Bein' with me is an obstacle
Women of the world
I got lots to pull
But we closer than most
Especially with our clothes of the floors
I'm only givin' dough's to those hoes
And without you is the one thing I hate
Together's our fate
But if ya ask baby I would jump in a lake
And I cheated
You stayed faithful
And I'm ungrateful
And I act so damn hateful
And over and o'er and o'er the sofa, finito
Cause I ain't seen when they get control of my libido
Forget about it
Cause I mean the world loves you
I was just playin' with them girls baby I love you
I know I messed up with ya baby I owe you
If we break up I'm a die o'er you

If ya ask me to kill
I would
If ya ask me to steal
I would
If ya want me to love ya
I could
But were so misunderstood

Baby this is too hard
The fightin' and the fussin' and the cussin' and ya bustin' me in my mouth
Girl I just want ya heart
I'm tusslin' with the fact that ya want me to get out
But I ain't leavin

You will listen to me now
If I gotta hold ya down (down, down)
We're soo misunderstood
Ya finally wonderin' why ya still keepin' me around

But if ya ask me to kill
I would
If ya ask me to steal
I would
If ya want me to love ya
I could
But were so misunderstood
(Pray for me ya'll)

And we're so misunderstood...</pre>
