Song:   Fixed
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Hip-Hop is art
Don't make another pop hit, be smart
Take it back to the start
Like KRS and Rakim use passion and heart

Don't get me wrong, I ain't dissing Dizzee Rascal
I'm just using his beat as a single example
It was the first big hit of its kind in the pop charts
Spawned a lot of shit with profit in mind, not heart

Channel U's full of "UK sound and ringtone"
Think they should all have "p45s to bring home"
Prancing about like they're the next big thing
cause their cousin's got an 8 track and their mate Daryll can sing

These kids getting above their station and sayin'
They're a vessel through which a higher power's conveyin':
"My lyrical content is a miracle, God sent"
My name is Scroobius Pip, I say fuck all that nonsense!

Their lyrical prognosis is like spiritual osmosis
In that everything they say evaporates into boasts - it's a joke!
I've listened and I can't even find one quote
Worth using as a reference or even as a footnote

Most of these kids could get their guns out and kill me
But how many got the skill to inspire and thrill me?
I've got a holster, I keep biscuits in it
It wears into your brain leaving big fat blisters in it

Who'm I better than? I'm better than I used to be
I'ma keep on getting better so you better just get used to me
You think that's a cop out? Then hear my point truthfully
cause chances are, this is how you should be

If your only goal's to be as good as Scroobius Pip
Then as soon as you achieve that your standards have slipped
If your goal is always to improve on yourself
Then the quest is never over no matter how big your wealth

Hip-Hop is art
Don't make another pop hit, be smart
Take it back to the start
Like KRS and Rakim use passion and heart </pre>
