Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Hey lady, don't you remember you was my lover you was my friend
Hey sister, I know you remember you left me alone now you want back in
Hey mama, don't you hear me? I can be a sucker for your love
Hey girlfriend, I understand it is what it is and it was what is was
And ever since you've been gone, it's been a lot of good things going on
And ever since you left that day, it's been a lot of good things going my way
What can I say? The clouds done rolled away
What can I say? Ain't no more rainy days. no, no..
I'll tell you, when you left me I thought I would never love again
Because you had me all confused and twisted up inside, I thought it was something that I did
Oh honey, you wouldn't wanna know what was going on inside my head!
Now everything is fine, you're out of my mind
I'm able to love myself instead
Ever since you've been gone, it's been a lot of good things going on
Ever since you left that day, it's been a lot of good things are come my way
What more can I say? The clouds done rolled away
What more can I say?
What more can I say? Ain't nomore rainy days!
Now, don't you wish you would've stayed?
What more can I say?
Look at the good things, good things that I've made
I made it without you, ever since you've been away
Been a lot of good things, good things everyday
Ever since you've been gone
Been a lot of good things, good things going on. hey yeah
Ever since you left that day, it's been a lot of good things good things come my way!

Ever since you've been gonnnnnnnnnne</pre>
