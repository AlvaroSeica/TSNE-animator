[Intro: Quavo]
Migos! Metro!
I mean all I ever wanted to be
Y'all know what we wanted to be
Rich!

[Chorus: Quavo]
All I ever wanted was some motherfuckin' guala (money)
Bando used to smell like some stinkin' enchiladas
The streets is a jungle, got to watch for the koalas (snoopers)
All I ever wanted was to get rid of them ounces (Ounces)
Ounces, Ounces, Ounces (Ounces)
Ounces, Ounces, Ounces (Gas)
Ounces, Ounces, Ounces (Uhh)
Whole lot of ounces (Whole lot)
Ounces, Ounces, Ounces (Ooh)
Ounces, Ounces, Ounces (Ooh)
All I ever wanted was to get rid of them ounces

Quavo! (Quavo)

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Walk around with large amounts of guala on me
I'm walking around with a pocket rocket, don't run up on me lonely
Bought my first Audi with the fish scale guts
Now I got the bitches, wanna fuck, they wanna cuddle up
When I Come to the bando, knock two times then twist the handle
Got everything in stock, whatever you need, just ask me
I'm selling that kush to Asher, real money, got a whole bag of Ashley
Molly taller than mountains
Drinking lean out a damn water fountains
She so bad gave me erection or whatever you call it
Bitch, me and my team been balling
Got your label keep motherfucking calling
Woke up to a bitch this morning, got 16 new text message
10 of em' saying go get to the guap, other 6 saying Migos up next

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Takeoff]
When I was a kid all I wanted was a hundred dollar bill
Now I'm 19, young nigga want 100 mil
Selling whole things
Want an ounce? Can't bust the seal
Wanna be a trapper? Never serve a nigga where you live
In the Bando counting chips no poker
Weighing bales of Okra
I got lots of O's, put my name right next to Al Capone
I'm a Wizard, Antwan Jamison
My plug ain't Kangaroo Jack, but he Australian
And he got crack sacks in the knapsack
Critics say I'm a product of my environment
Selling that dope to economists
Menace to society
On the top of the mountain, you under me
Young nigga, I'm trapping and grinding
No scale for the workers, I'm eying it
You niggas still nickel and diming
Remix the dope and you niggas still buying it

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Offset]
Fuck the rap game cause these rap niggas really ain't shit
I hop in the Audi, I hop in the Bentley
Fuck it I'm smashing that bitch
Young rich nigga with the Rollie wrist
Trapping and capping, I'm selling the bird
You fuck niggas really ain't serving
Selling the bricks to the plug up in Berlin
Put the dope in the water, hit it with the egg beater
Sipping lean, yeah I'm good, I'm tequila
My neck is so sick, got the measles
This for my my niggas that trap in the Regal
Ounces, ounces, ounces, molly Santana's tall as a mountain
Put the molly on top of her tonsils
She sucking and fucking, she ain't got no manners
Back to the basics, I'm counting these faces
My pockets inflating off trapping and baiting
You niggas fugazy
My niggas, they strapped like the Navy
I'm the mayor
Matter fact I'm the president
Sipping on Actavis, like it's my medicine
Throwing the bird with accuracy
All of you niggas is amateur
Pull up in Phantoms, but trap out of Challengers

[Chorus]
