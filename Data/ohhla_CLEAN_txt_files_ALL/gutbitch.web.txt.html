[Webbie]
Look hop in my ride, stash this, hold that
Be cool turn the sound up and roll that
Now you my gutta bitch, lil' momma don't get it twisted
No trippin, no house buiness you know I got other bitches
I mean its plain and clear I'm a motherfuckin player
Don't worry about the other teammates long as you straight
And taken care of, look here don't worry about me boo
Just worry 'bout you follow my playa hand rules
And everything will go smooth
Just wait for me I'll be back I ain't gon be gone long
Gotta make a couple rounds hold it down while I'm gone
This some gutta ass G shit girl I can't tell ya I love ya
but you ain't just some other ho I kinda got feelinhs fo ya
You just play you your part right don't slip and stay focused
Somebody might get laid off and you'll just get promoted
Been thuggin like you supose to real to me vice versa
I know you won't get close to it ain't the time I'm Andy Cursor

[Chorus]
You my gutta bitch, who I'm with
when I'm in shit with my other bitch
My other bitch when my other bitch be on some other shit
like oh girl I need you to keep my secrets, man look
You my gutta bitch who I'm with
when I'm in shit with my other bitch
My other bitch when my other bitch be on some other shit
like oh girl I need you to keep my secrets

[Webbie]
I'm a hustler
I don't have quality time to spend on what I'm sayin
And then I'm split it in 10's
So like a man I'ma come as soon as I come
Let me beat it cause I don't know when I'ma be leavin again
That's just me, that's how I play it
I hit the pole and roll cause
I know no money trucks come to the front door
Now don't go and get it wrong
Thinkin I'm actin funny
I can't give you to much time shit time is money
And you know my main boo new
You just don't know what she'll do to you
Ohh she might go off and get to  shootin you so on the real
Keep it cool is what we gonna do
Ahh ah don't call me I'ma call you
You miss my call den fuck it don't do that *67
call back or nothin
This down low pro shit
Gotta be up to par
You gutta bitch bet not get me caught

[Chorus]

[Webbie]
See you got a old man, I respect that
I ain't even gonna check that
real shit and I expect to get the same shit back
you catch me wit my old lady
Ridin in my Cadillac
I don't wanna horn to honk
And I don't want a smile crack
You do that shit I bet that, we ain't gon' be smilin back
We might just swerve on yo ass straight up tryin to handle that
I'll right you fuck'n webbie
No need for reppin
I wanna fuck her too so don't even tell yo best friend
Talkin all that gansta shit, realy don't impress me
Keepin it on the down low, then I'll be impressed then
Don't even tell your damn self
It ain't nobody's business
what we do, where we go, how we come, where we been

[Chorus]</pre>
