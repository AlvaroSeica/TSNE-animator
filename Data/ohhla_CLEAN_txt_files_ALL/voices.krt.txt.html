[Big K.R.I.T.]
Yeah! I got these voices in my ear
Ay! Yeah, got these voices in my ear
Ha-hah! Yeah, I got these voices in my ear
Yeah, breathe

Wake up to the sound of a million horns
Jesus piece, ruby red, diamonds in the thorns
Say a prayer for the jammed and the ones that's gone
I might have missed my nigga wake, but still I mourn
Did it big in the club with my cash out
Been dealing with a lot, so I drunk until I passed out
Went abroad, I met a broad with her ass out
Her concern was to earn like, nigga what your cash bout? (money!)
In the VIP on my tip with a glass out
We live a paparazzi life, what's your flash bout?
In a mattress in the ceiling, what's your stash bout?
In case I had doubts

[Chorus]
I got these voices in my ear
They tell me get up, get up, get up
I got these voices in my ear
They tell me wake up, wake up, wake up
I got these voices in my ear
They tell me keep running, keep running, keep running
I got these voices in my ear
They tell me get money, get money, get money, get money
Breathe

[Big K.R.I.T.]
What if a dream was all you had?
And life ain't fab, you can't throw it in the bag
Niggas ain't real, hoes ain't shit
My hand-me-downs was too big, they buying clothes that don't fit
I'm like, it was more the fame than the credit
Feeling like my whole life I've been trying to be the freshest
Respected, in a world full of kings
You pathetic, if you can't buy the finer things
Before you exit, the very moment that you got it
I swear my biggest fear is that I'll die nobody
Forgotten, when I was really at my best
Seems like nothing left

[Chorus]

[Big K.R.I.T.]
Lately I've been feeling like fuck it
Heaven's in my face, but Lord knows I can't touch it
Plus I heard the angel wings was kinda heavy
Scared to put 'em on my back so I threw 'em on a Chevy
Death knocking on my door, I can get it
Looking through the peephole in case I ain't ready
Fuck this rap shit, yeah I said it
On the road to the riches, ain't no telling where I'm headed
Now I dread it, the world ain't what it seems
Enduring all the shit to be a king
Praying for tomorrow, some more time to borrow
Scared, aware, they whisper, never fear

[Chorus]

[Outro: sample from the film "The Kid Stays in the Picture"]
"My life today? Hmm, more volatile than ever
 This last year alone I've been shot down, bloodied, trampled, accused, threatened
 disgraced, betrayed, scandalized, maligned
 Tough? You bet your ass it is
 But I ain't complaining, nothing comes easy"
"The last question: Is it truly worth it?"
"Sure, know why? I love what I do, and very few people do
 And when you think of most of your work that you do in life
 most of people's lives are spent in their endeavors
 and very few people really enjoy what they do
 and I love what I do, so yeah, it's worth it
 Damn right, it's worth it"</pre>
