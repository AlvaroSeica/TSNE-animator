[Chorus - 1: Jim Crow]
The ladies they choose
They love when I cruise
They all want to sleep with me 
Because of 22's on my car
(Cars, cars, cars)
Some raw 24's, Avalanche wit TV's
When you get up inside
Don't spill no liquor on the seats of this car
(Cars, cars, cars)
I met this chick in a drop, '67 Crovette
I offered to call her 
But she's playin' hard to get in her car
(Cars, cars, cars)
Every girl that I know 
And every girl that I see
They all wanna cut
But it's really not me, it's the car
(Cars, cars, cars)

[Verse: Mr. Mo]
I'm in the Regals 'n Cutlass, Impalas
Trucks, they fuckin' be droppin'
Engine's suspension be squeeking
Bitches by speakers they freaking
Police they catch us indecent
In the vehicle that's leased up
Buddy in the Cutt all tree'd up
He knew what it was so he eased up
Musta' been the candy paint (paint)
That attracted them jackas and skanks (skanks)
Know that them hams is spanked (spanked)
For the Candid Camera man
Everybody face get stuck (stuck)
When the brand new Benz pull up
And it's sitting on the dubs in Trade (Trade)
Jump out wit a throwback Braves (Braves)
Nigga ain't playin' this treal (treal)
I got a crib but the cars where I live

[Chorus - 2: Jim Crow]
The ladies they choose
They love when I cruise
They all want to sleep with me 
Because of 22's on my car
(Cars, cars, cars)
Some raw 24's, Avalanche wit TV's
When you get up inside
Don't spill no liquor on the seats of this car
(Cars, cars, cars)

[Verse: Polow]
Hold up, bendin' corners (bendin' corners man)
On 22's (on them Lil' Joe's man)
I'm that nigga (I'm that nigga)
That groupies choose (that groupies will do)
Now I'm a G (G - G)
Straight from the start (start start, start)
And when I pull this pistol (pow pow)
It's gon' stop ya hard (awww)
Give it to me now, figaroh figg-aroh
I'm old school, fall through in the '84
Wit brick red top, Cadillac brome
That's why your baby mama won't leave me 'lone
Got a girl named Shanelle wit a blue Chevelle
Big lil' freak from ATL
Got a freak named Tonya wit a black Impala
Ten-thousand dolla' rims, still stay wit her mama
Now she's so ghetto, but it's all gravy
I ain't got nuthin' but love for ya baby, now pay me
Got a older lady, she drive a Mercedes
The only thing crazy is the hoe smell shady
But, yes of coarse, yes of coarse
By age 20 I'm pushing Porshe
I'm the boy wit the raps, hoes on my back
Ain't nuthin' in the world like my Cadillac

[Bridge: Jim Crow]
We pull up in the vert like WHAM!
Shawty in the skirt like WHAM!
Gave her two minutes in the back like
WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! WHAM!
Yea, that stankin' lankin' WHAM!
(Cars, cars, cars)
Make a lame ass niggas say DAMN!

[Verse: Cutty Cartel]
'87 Re-gal, gut so clean
Eights and bolds on the Cuttlass Supreme
Original paint, dudes in the back
Thangs I do to that old school 'Lac
Mink on the necks, bitch on the grill
Cherry wood when I whip my wheel
Some bought us a Beem, the girl gon' drill
Chrome on the rims on this car here
Candy apple wit a slant in the ass
I scoop this girl off Ashley
She don't care bout spending her change (her change)
She just like riding on these thangs

[Chorus - 1]

(Cars, cars, cars)</pre>
