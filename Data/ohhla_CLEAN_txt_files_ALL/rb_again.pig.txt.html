[Pigeon John]
Well I was 12 in Inglewood when I first heard your voice
Felt like a dad I never knew and I knew I had no choice
So you're the voice I always heard when the silence got loud
And you're the artist behind all the animals in the clouds
And you been walkin right beside me, all my life
You say you love and adore me and I'm your delight
Well, I been frozen in the grain build high on the floor
It's so loud, I can't hear you no more

[Chorus]
Well you always have been my best friend
I always mess it up in the end
I'm hittin rock bottom again
I think I'm hittin rock bottom again

[Pigeon John]
With all the girls and all the drugs well I'm a rap clich√© 
I was convinced I never be one, would've swore on my grave
I never stooped that low until it was in front of my face
And no one was lookin and I took it and it quickly replaced
the things I stood for when I was in L.A. Sym-phony
We took Uno, FLYNN, bTwice, Sharlok, Joey and Great J
I mean we had the scene without a gleam of sweat on our face
I'm comin down, I need just one more taste

[Chorus]
Well you always have been my best friend
I always mess it up in the end
I'm hittin rock bottom again
I think I'm hittin rock bottom again
You always have been my best friend
and I always mess it up in the end
I'm gonna hit rock bottom again
I'm gonna hit rock bottom again

[Pigeon John]
Where did all my friends go?
Where did they all go?
Goddamn, I miss my friends
Goddamn, I miss my friends

(Help me... please help me, daddy)</pre>
