[The Jet Age of Tomorrow]
HEY~! It's yo' birthday, ahhhhh
Girl it's yo' birthday, ooh-ooh-ah-ahhh
It's yo' birthday (birthday, yo' birthday) uhh, UHH!
It's yo' birthday (don't forget it) you know it's yo' birthday, uhh
You eighteen, the one new day, where you can do yo' own thang
This is yo' birthday, happy birthday, uhh, uhh
It's yo' birthday, at the {?} strip club, or your momma club
Do what you like, cause it's yo' birthday
Or you could buy the bar not only if you want to but you don't have to
Just sayin, you got the option
BIRTHDAY, YEAH, YEAHHHHH, YEAHHHHHHHHH
YEAHHHHHH, YEAHHHHH, yo' birthday, birthday
Yo' birthday, yo' birthday yeah (holla)</pre>
