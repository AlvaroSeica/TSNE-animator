Let's get it started in here

And the bass keeps running, running and runnin runnin'
and runnin' runnin' and runnin' runnin' and runnin' runnin'
and runnin' runnin' and runnin' runnin, and runnin' runnnin' and

In this context, there's no disrespect
So when I bust my rhyme, you break ya necks
We got five minutes for us to disconnect
From all intellect and let the rhythm effect

Get loose in inhibition follow your intuition
Free your inner soul and break away from tradition
Cause when we be out, girlies pull the heat out
You wouldn't believe how we wow shit out
Burnin' 'til it's burned out, turn it 'til it's turned out
Act up from North West East South

[Chorus]
Everybody, everybody, just get into it, get stupid
Get it started, get it started, get it started
Let's get it started, (ha) let's get it started (in here)
Let's get it started, (ha) let's get it started (in here)
Let's get it started, (ha) let's get it started (in here)
Let's get it started, (ha) let's get it started (in here) yeah

Lose control, up outta your soul
Don't move to fast, people, just take it slow
Don't get ahead, just jump into it
Y'all hear about it, the Peas will do it
Get started, get stupid
Don't worry about it, people will walk you through it
Step by step like your into new kid
Inch by inch with the new solution
Transmit hits with no delusion
The feeling's irresistible and that's how we move it

[Chorus]
Everybody, everybody, just get into it, get stupid
Get it started, get it started, get it started
Let's get it started, (ha) let's get it started (in here)
Let's get it started, (ha) let's get it started (in here)
Let's get it started, (ha) let's get it started (in here)
Let's get it started, (ha) let's get it started (in here) yeah

Runnin' runnin' and runnin' runnin' and runnin' runnin'

C'mon y'all, let's get (coo-koo), uh huh, let's get (coo-koo) in here
Wild out, get (coo-koo), uh huh, let's get (coo-koo) in here
Wild out, get (coo-koo), uh huh, let's get (coo-koo) in here

Ohh ohh ohh, yada, yada, yada, yada, yada, yada, yada
yada, yada, yada, yada, yada, yada, yada, yada, yada

Let's get ill, that's the deal
Ap the gate, and Will bring the thugged out drill (just)
Lose your mind, this is the time
Y'all can't stand still, trust and bang your spine (just)
Bob your head like epilepsy
Up inside the club or in your Bentley
Get messy, loud and sick
You mind pass normal or another head trip
So, come them now, do not correct it
Let's get ignorant, let's get hectic

[Chorus]
Everybody, everybody, just get into it, get stupid
Get it started, get it started, get it started
Let's get it started, (ha) let's get it started (in here)
Let's get it started, (ha) let's get it started (in here)
Let's get it started, (ha) let's get it started (in here)
Let's get it started, (ha) let's get it started (in here) yeah

Whoooooaaa

Get (coo-koo), uh huh, we (coo-koo) in here
Let's get (coo-koo), uh huh, we (coo-koo) in here
Wild out, get (coo-koo), uh huh, we (coo-koo) in here

Ohh ohh ohh, yada, yada, yada, yada, yada, yada, yada
yada, yada, yada, yada, yada, yada, yada, yada, yada

And runnin' runnin' and runnin' runnin' and runnin' runnin' and..</pre>
