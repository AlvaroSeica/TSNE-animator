C.M.G., Custom Made Gangstas
(what's up Ke), what's up baby
(say mayn, it's been a long time mayn)
That's right, (put these placks on the wall mayn) fa sho

[Hook]
Crunch time, ball in your hand the time's running
Either win or lose, go all out for the cash money
Calculated steps, one mistake and the game's over
A Custom Made Gangsta for real, a true soldier

[Lil' Keke]
I pulled up 84's, suicide drop do's
Sitting at the club, on the belly with the top closed
Niggaz know me in the streets, cause I spit flows
But don't ever get it twisted, I pimp hoes
Sipping oil, in a platinum mind frame
Bought a new Benz, cause it's mo' in my price range
Shake 'em up nigga, cause I roll like a dice game
Keep some good snipers in the back, with a nice aim
Steps up the ladder, but they calculated
The Don here for the title, and I smell they hate it
These niggaz is overrated, they ain't working the field
Herschelwood is my hood, I'm a soldier for real
Hey, I just talk this way
But you can hear my life troubles, when you press that play
Ok, I'ma take it to the gutter and back
And my family gotta eat, if it's rap or crack fa sho

[Hook]
Crunch time, ball in your hand the time's running
Either win or lose, go all out for the cash money
Calculated steps, one mistake and the game's over
But I'm holding it down, Q.B. is a real soldier
Crunch time, ball in your hand the time's running
Either win or lose, go all out for the cash money
Calculated steps, one mistake and the game's over
A Custom Made Gangsta for real, a true soldier

[Q.B.]
True soldier, from the city of sinners
To be a winner, you gotta be colder than winter
Kept it plotting, every move that I make
Cause snakes got they eyes on me, hate to see the young'n loaded with cake
Moving the rock, like a guard of seminal
I ain't speaking subliminal, one shot one chance like Eminem
Haters in competition, get rid of em
Charge they life on a black card, for trying to spy like Dan Akroyd
I'm that hard, I go Shaq hard
I make moves like the President, win or lose go all out for the presidents
Like Mike Vick in the fourth quarter, it's hard running the sideline
And trying not to get hit by the blindside, it's crunch time

[Hook]

[Lil' Keke]
I grind for perfection, but nothing mistake free
My pebbles turn to them rocks, my rocks turn to a ki
We move at nigga speed, you facing a bigger league
A trained marine, on the scene to make 'em bleed
A soldier, so I walk that path
Cause I'm chasing after zero's, and holding a slab
On the grind, cause this game is mine
You keep your eyes on the prize, my nigga it's crunch time

[Q.B.]
I'm going all out, shocking and rocking for extra grams
Till I crawl out, in my new driveway in a slab
I was struggling, hard times just made me better now
I'm doubling, thank God he made the weather change
What it's been, Section A's and K's sprayed
A lot of homies die, trying to make it through this maze
Big and Pac gone, when we gon change our ways
Living in the last days, young nigga get paid

[Hook]

(*talking*)
That's right, Q.B./Young Don
Custom Made Gangstas, C.M.G. since the first day
It's about to be the worst day, you know I'm saying
Get ready, coming soon
"Loved By Few, Hated By Many", the Young Don is back
S.U.C. to the finish, Swishahouse the new beginning
0-6 we in the mix that's right, Herschelwood Hardheads
For life native Houston South Park, Sunnyside that's right</pre>
