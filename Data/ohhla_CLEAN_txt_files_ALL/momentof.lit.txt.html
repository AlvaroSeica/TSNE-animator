Different from the compositions heard from the past
I'm out to educate what I believe is certain to pass with some devastation
drama and a comet to crash
I'm bout take you on a ride with not a moment to

That
that just like that and I'll be dag and to the gonnet you can touch my track
so why act
act just like that
my track will drag you on the floor and leave you scuffed like tracks
and while you dragging on the floor just let me cut right back
I'm like a dragon with the flow but this ain't 'the' right track
but I'ma drag until that moment on the stuff I have to say
is badly leading on to where we bust like glass...

Well
I'ma break it right back down to the nitty gritty
where the people get smacked down just for giving pity
in the middle of a wicked city
when it ain't no feelings people giving till you end up missing
but it ain't no ending to the killings and the mass bombings
and that's something for people to be that heartless
but thank God we ain't harmed by an H bomb
when it ain't to say that we ain't walking on the Great Bomb like present arms now
Bang! Everybody's really supposed to forget
the incidents the government's presenting as over
really endless breeds and cultures suffer penalties
holding another generation vacant for a bigger destruction
bust it! Different from the compositions heard from the past
I'm out to educate what I believe is certain to pass with some devastation
drama and a comet to crash
I bet I take you on a ride and leave a moment to last and like...

That
that just like that and I'll be dag and to the gonnet you can touch my track
so why act
act just like that
my track will drag you on the floor and leave you scuffed like tracks
and while you dragging on the floor just let me cut right back
I'm like a dragon with the flow but this ain't 'the' right track
but I'ma drag until that moment on the stuff I have to say
is badly leading on to where we bust like glass...

But if I brought it right back down to the nitty gritty
think I'll probably get smacked down just for being silly
so I really need to keep it seri Â–ously
intended for the children that might end up listening
knowing in the end that it's the children who should have something
besides bombing to hear at every class party
ask George if he operates on race cards
when he hates to say we interrupt him
while he's playing golf like select iron now Swing!
Anybody living should know that we on
a thinner block of ice than any penguin that's polar
hold a history book close and watch the pictures and quotings
begin to illustrate a message that be bigger than Texas
check it! Different from the compositions heard from the past
I'm out to educate what I believe is certain to pass with some devastation
drama and a comet to crash
I thought I'd take you on a ride with half a moment to last and like...

That
that just like that and I'll be dag and to the gonnet you can touch my track
so why act
act just like that
my track will drag you on the floor and leave you scuffed like tracks
and while you dragging on the floor just let me cut right back
I'm like a dragon with the flow but this ain't 'the' right track
but I'ma drag until that moment on the stuff I have to say
is badly leading on to where we bust like glass...

Well
you probably know my act down to the nitty gritty
so it's proper that I back down from the written script
leave a comma where it stands now what should be a period
and I'ma pull the pants down like I'm William Clinton of the government
clutched within the palm of my embodiment is nothing
but the unsuspected fall of our environment
clutch whatever's close and take a ride inside my mind
as I will touch on every subject like the prophet of all time
like Dang! Stepping out the middle of Georgia
with not a single threat in sight aside of healing my soul
so roll a spliff and keep composure 'fore the scenery's crowded
with clouds of everybody's gun and powder shooting through bodies
how bout it! Different from the compositions heard from the past
I'm out to educate what I believe is certain to pass with some devastation
drama and a comet to crash
I bet I took you on a ride and now the moment has passed but like...

That
that just like that and I'll be dag and to the gonnet you can touch my track
so why act
act just like that
my track will drag you on the floor and leave you scuffed like tracks
and while you dragging on the floor just let me cut right back
I'm like a dragon with the flow but this ain't 'the' right track
but I'ma drag until that moment on the stuff I have to say
is badly leading on to where we bust like glass...</pre>
