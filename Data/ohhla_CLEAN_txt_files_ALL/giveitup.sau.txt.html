[Saul Williams - singing]
Hey, can I talk to you?
Hey, I wanna talk to you
Get out of your head
It's all in your mind
If you don't find no way to rearrange it
then we're out of time
Hey, can I talk to you?
Hey, I wanna talk to you
Now give it... up
Give it... up
Hey, can I talk to you?
Hey, I wanna talk to you

[Saul Williams - speaking]
Give it up; the tragedies of your mind
All your fears and doubts are mounting up
There's no room for you to breathe there
Who says you must perpetuate all the nonsense you were born into?
In the old days there were men who looked at fear and never questioned

[Saul Williams - singing]
Hey, can I talk to you?
Hey, I wanna talk to you
Now give it... up
Now give it... up
Hey, can I talk to you?
Hey, I wanna talk to you

[Saul Williams - speaking]
Give it up; the distance of your mind
When she hugs you she just wants to feel you present
And all the moments you resent your vulnerabilities are see-through
She sees God in you
Just because she loves you doesn't mean she can't see faults in you

[Saul Williams - singing]
Get out of your head
It's all in your mind
If you don't find no way to rearrange it
Then we're out of time
And give it... up
Uh give it... up
Uh give it, uh give it up
Uh give it, uh give it up
Uh give it... up
Uh give it up, give it up, give it up, give it up
Get up!
Hey, uh {*4X*}
Hey, can I talk to you?
Hey, I wanna talk to you</pre>
