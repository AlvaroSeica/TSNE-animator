Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Yeah, Whoop

[Chorus]
Ah ah aw yeah
You can tell em that its aw yeah
Came threw deep, everybody's all here
You ain't got to count it cause the money's all there, aw yeah

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
Aw yeah, tell 'em it my year
Tell 'em its my life it's more than a career
I was made for it, paid for it, slaved for it
Third times a charms so I went and bought a chain for it
Alumni, dumb high, you know what it is
West side, bad day, all up in this bitch
Got my wheels up, take off how many more I got to break off
Show yall that I ain't soft, think I might go A-Wall
Still I rest no stress
Come alive from the S.L.S
Front line nigga fuck who next
Head shots, fuck your vest
Case closed I'm killin the game
Everybody's feelin the same
Grab an umbrella cuz you bout to feel my rain

[Chorus]
Aw yeah
You can tell them its aw yeah
Came threw deep, everybody's all here
You ain't got to count it cause the money's all there, aw yeah
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Ah ah aw yeah, yeah, yeah [x2]
You can tell em that it's aw yeah, aw yeah

[Verse 2: Kid Ink]
Think I'm bout to do it, rest of y'all comin up short like chewy
Lately I've been on my great list, this is just the basics
So just sit back and wait but if you think you want some come try
You know what I'm on
Got my dog pound, one bitch, bad to the bone
Can't keep this up, no outlet
Off it, and aw shit
I'm on one, two blunts
Tell them we auction
Aw yeah, nothin but stars here, we bout to call out 2,3 Tarheels
Man you can't fuck with my team, you already know the dream
Baby let me hear you scream

[Chorus]
Aw yeah
You can tell them its aw yeah
Came threw deep, everybody's all here
You ain't got to count it cause the money's all there, aw yeah
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Ah ah aw yeah, yeah, yeah [x2]
You can tell em that it's aw yeah, aw yeah
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Ah ah aw yeah, yeah, yeah [x2]
You can tell em that it's aw yeah, aw yeah</pre>
