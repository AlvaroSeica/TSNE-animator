[Female Voice] I'm Jake Lefco! ("And you are?")

[Female Voice]
I like to curl up in the bottom - drawer of my parents' bureau
And take a nap, from time to time

[Jake Lefco]
Yo; come on in, everybody have a seat
Take a load off, put your stereo on repeat
Stereo on repeat, when I flow on the beat
It can go on for weeks - I'm dead serious
You don't wanna sleep when I speak on the P.A.
Seems like the beat, mic and me got a three-way
Fuck the he say, she say believe me
I get you high, and I'm safer than freebase
But watch what you say, take it ea-zy
You talk shit, then I spit - how your feet taste?
Live off freestyles and cheesesteaks
And still strong as King Kong on my weak days
This is more than somethin to sample
Shouts to Happ G, Brief, Snuffy and Scandal
I'm ill - I'm a peaceful man though
Too many rappers out now swearin they're Rambo
Call me soft but I don't really get it
Negativity can get to me but I don't really let it
Cause I'm way too busy gettin it on
Makin music for the white, black, rich and the poor
It is what it is, I do this for the kids
For your boy who didn't make it, for your cousin doin bids
Mostly for the love of doin this
Hope to motivate the knucklehead who wasn't doin shit

[Chorus]
I came too far to goof off; knock your socks and your shoes off
I'm Jake Lefco - and you are?
Too far to goof off; knock your socks and your shoes off
I'm Jake Lefco - and you are?

[Jake Lefco]
It's been a minute since I addressed it, my love for my message
In essence my mic sessions are life lessons, I'm light headed
There - I said it, I want credit, just might get it
I'm Jake Lefco, the right medicine, nice with it
Day and night spit it, spend my life with it
I'm hype get it right y'all, like a pipe bomb
Sprayin songs like Lysol, your favorite writ-er
Squeeze mics with this python, called my right arm
Psych nah; not that strong - but the flows are
So far off the tip of my tongue they roll off
They don't fall short of that frequent thought
Gettin back to Marlboro shore in the mood for more
I use the Force and my boys to move the floor
For you and yours, whoever comes through the doors
Gettin touched by the lyricist's smooth rapport
It's like a new velour, come prove me wrong

[Chorus]

[Male Voice]
Hi, I'm Jake Lefco, welcome to my album, welcome to my world

[Another Voice]
Hiiiiiiii I'm Jake Lefco uhh
It's not really me rhyming on this album
Actually I have to, confess
I really don't, rhyme, I've never rhymed in my life
It's actually a, stunt double who's very talented

[Female Voice]
Hi, I'm Jake Lefco!
I like to rhyme about happy things
Like helping my grandma, and bicycles, and birthday parties

[Male Voice]
Hi this is Jake Lefco
Do you know what you're missing if you don't buy this album?

[Spanish Female]
Hola, me llamo Jake Lefco

[Female Voice]
I'm Jake, Lefco and I love fruit roll-ups
And they're good for you they're FRUIT~!

[Male Voice]
Hi, I'm Jake Lefco
I used to be just like you, working a dead-end job
But then, I found out that I look like the Jewish Keanu Reeves
And ever since then, it's been on</pre>
