Do you wanna have a party? 	Yeah! Yeah!
(repeat 3X)
Then get down, get down, hit it
Dance, shake your feets

Dance, shake your feets
We want you, to have a funky party
But make sure, that you don't hurt nobody
Now ladies, if you want to dance
Then the Mob fellas want to see you work your pants
and they'll say

	OHH BABY, I WANT TO SEE YOU DANCE
You want to what?
	OHH LADY, I WANT TO TOUCH YOUR PANTS
	OHH BABY, I WANT TO SEE YOU DANCE
You want to WHAT?
	SEXY LADY, I WANT TO TOUCH YOUR PANTS

As we said before, we like to work our bodies
But to make sure, that we don't hurt nobody
All the ladies in the world, if you want to dance
Then you've got your chance, so shake shake your pants
To all the fellas, that like the sexy ladies
Why don't you look at them and say... work it baby

	OHH BABY, I WANT TO SEE YOU DANCE
You want to what?
	OHH LADY, I'D LIKE TO TOUCH YOUR PANTS
	OHH BABY, I WANT TO SEE YOU DANCE
	SEXY LADY, OH LET ME DO THAT AGAIN

Work it baby, that's what you told us to do
We have a question, and it is just for you
Why should we, let you touch our pants
	OHH BABY, I JUST WANT TO SEE YOU DANCE

Ohh now, you know it's plain to see
What we can do for you, if you can get funky

	EVERYBODY, THE PARTY'S HERE TO STAY
	SO LISTEN TO ME, WHEN I SAY
	GET FUNKY

Dance

	OHHHHHH, WORK IT BABY
Dance
(repeat 4X)

We want you, to have a funky party

But to make sure, that we don't hurt nobody
Now ladies, if you want to dance
Then the Mob fellas want to see you work your pants
and they'll say

	OHH BABY, I WANT TO SEE YOU DANCE

As we said before, we like to work our bodies

But to make sure, that we don't hurt nobody

	OHH, LET ME TOUCH YOUR BODY GIRL
	I LOVE YOU I LOVE YOU I LOVE YOU I LOVE YOUUUUUU, YEAH
