Song:   It's a Relief
Typed by: Cno Evil

[Chorus 2X: Li-Mouse]
It's a relief (the way I congregate words into bars)
It's a relief (the way I congregate words to leave scars)
It's a relief (the way I move smooth on these tracks)
It's a relief (Li-Mouse...)

[Li-Mouse]
Aiyo, straight up, man, ya'll cats need to check it
Can't all microphones clutch, when I spit, I always wreck it
Like fast cars and bald tires in a snowy winter
Ya'll crashing, I'm smashing, you catching, a million splinters
Peppered over your face, can't lose like NASA in space
I'mma keep a close look, just in case
I got to move quick like drivers in a Nascar race
At a fast pace, nigga, you could never replace
Mickey Grouch, nigga, yeah, that's me
You can tell by the way I always flow all nasty like I
Microwave McDonald's fries, or two people kissing
Yeah, I mean a bunch of guys
Fuck ya'll that hate on the, Mickey Grouch
Fuck it, I still wield that, mean fucking mouth, bitch
My style only computes some glitches
And I'm coming at ya, like baseball pitches
To batters, muthafucka, it don't matter
Cuz when I start spitting, niggas start to scatter
No escape, you can be skinny or fatter
It's like rain, when it hits something, it'll splatter
I've had it, I've bent backwards trying to be nice
I roll over your sharply like cutting a pizza slice
Jesus Christ, help me hold this tight like a vice
So I don't make the same stupid mistake twice

[Chorus 2X]

[Li-Mouse]
I've been possessed with many of the Egyptian Gods
That told me to strike terror on niggas with the iron rod
While Anubis wants me to commit destruction through war
Judging the dead with Osiris, with deadly lyrical swords
My mind and body are torn apart, it's possessed
Swiftly this time I only become obsessed, and the rest?
I left, for what is now called the living death
Who never had a single chance to take the last breath
It's like fuck it, if Ra don't wanna shine on me
You can push me hard like shopping carts on spree
I'll adapt to the darkness outside like on the inside
And rely on God to give me enough light to decide
What I need in this world or meaning of life
Will I rise to something or die by the devil's night
Fuck that, my body's made of U.S. steel
Cno Evil beats are ease and definite they will shield
Me from wack rappers with wack ass beats
From wack actors with fake ass rap sheets
I really hate ya'll, yes, I really do hate you
Exclusive track, you heard how I could scrape you
I'm smacking the pigment out of you bitch ass dicks
And I hope the black from my hand on your face sticks
Straight up Verizon niggas need to stop acting phony
If not, you get shot like them niggas fighting for that new Sony
System, I rip 'em limb from limb, not nice like a pony
Ask Oscar Meyer, shit is not bologna
It's only, potent enough to make your family mad lonely
And I'll make sure your children feel it when they clone me
Homey, you can't kill me if you try to stone me
Li-Mouse, Mickey Grouch, the king, try to dethrone me
I'm positive, to negate your bank account, so you feel lonely
And the creep will lead to niggas feeling mad phony
I'm tense like rope during a game of tug o' war
Elevator cables that move quick up to top floors
Having ya'll look like Greyhound logos, you dogs be running

[Cno Evil]
Then I'm the Bee-Line bus coming, and you bitches buzzing
Bzzz, fuck out of here, like Tucker on the Sixth Sense
Narrow minded, mind dense
You can't play me like Guys and Dolls don't pay Rent
Ya'll Cats can't be a Lion King, read the lyrics, find out what I meant
Faggot...</pre>
