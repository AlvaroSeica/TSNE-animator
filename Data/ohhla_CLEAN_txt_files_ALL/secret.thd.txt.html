(birds chirping)
(chanting)
(water drop and evil laughing)
As I submit the new world grows in
Six, I cover myself with lamb skin
Black family, fine point to win
That again, prophecy watch the magic, can you?
Must begin to think, sit up
And you can see par 22 was lit up
With the skull and bone
Betchya what is known of the scroll and key
Of the D.O.C.

Yeah
Yeah
I have a secret plan
New world connects and threatens man
Other hand, everyone fake god
Light, neofight, spit
On the cross from a pit
And I look
And I behold a pale horse
Forty-Second degree, mind in the source
Original, it's from the brotherhood
In the beginning, yet you never could
Listen
Ain't that kept undercover another one cause I got
Six got hung by the beast
Looking for the golden feet
With shackles
Lookin' to Jackyls, Greenpeace
To a ring to fill
Death come quicker when you shoot to kill
Watchout!
But your merry, sleep with your gun
Show me the sign innocent one
The end might come
Now whatchya gonna do
Night
Be to cold
Who shall save the human race, none
Six thousand, erase, replace
Replace
Replace
Replace
Replace
Replace
Replace
Replace
Here in by now, was so organized
Look for brotherhood
Made light the skies
Symbol of who arrives
Four thousand years, the past
Remember
Religion is better to to control your ass
Reflect
When the millenium connect
its so def freakin' right to meant to be elect
Reflect
Come face the order
Witness the immatical manslaughter
Now
Follow the master, supreme degree
The new world curve, now jet the 33
Thirteen levels above thee I see
Heel never to reveal the real keys
To the esoteric language
As you enter a brand new age of anguish
Pyramid
Police turn my niggaz into theives
No matter, six thousand delete, repeat
Repeat X12
(Sirens, gunshots, breaking glass, screams, and laughing)
Momma I don't want to die
Mind crawl
Circle complete when they creep the cat claw
Alien, secret unto the ages
Be symbolic to the dead sea pages
Nights
History didn't
We forgettin from where the cocaine 
Brotherhood of the insane
Slay
Humanity you can not identify thyself
I sign and pray
Sign, hand over forehead
Countersign  pyramid, eagle wing spread,hey
Luciferian, totalitarian, socialistic, twistic mind
So when they bail
Holy blood, holy grail
Historically, they don't want a nigga to see
Trilateral begun kurk
Political murdering, do the gun work
Chasin'
To replace the hell
Into a jail cell
Society, don't want you in they clientel
No matter, six thousand we blood runnin'
'95's the beginning, watchout it's comin'

America is now under martial law
Stay in your home
Do not attempt contact with loved ones
insurance agents, or attorneys
Do not attempt to think or depression may occur
Stay in your homes
Curfew is at 7 p.m. sharp, after work
Anyone caught outside the gates of their
subdivision sectors after curfew, will be shot
Remain calm
Do not panic
Your neighborhood watch officer will be by
to collect urine samples in the morning
Anyone caught interferring with the collection
of urine samples will be shot
Stay in your homes
Remain calm
The number one enemy of progress is question
National security is more important than individual will
All sports broadcasts will proceed as normal
No more than two people may gather anywhere without permission
Use only the drugs prescribed by your boss or supervisor
Be happy
Obey all orders without question
Be happy
At last, everything is done for you</pre>
