[Verse One]
Remember when I was so weak for you
Remember when I felt so deep for you
I remember the day I cried for you
Remember the days I though I'd die for you
But you said you had no time for me
Said that you and I would never be
Said you wouldn't mind gettin' up between my legs
But not good enough to be your girl that's what you said

[Pre-Chorus x2]
Ooh how you broke my heart that day
All the love I had for you
But only disrespect did you show me

[Chorus]
Now you want my love
So what ya tryin' to tell me?
Now I'm good enough?
And now you want my time
If you think you're gunna get it
Must be out ya fuckin mind

[Verse Two]
Now it was pure disrespect that you showed me
And now suddenly a brother wanna know me
Is it because I'm Ms. Dynamitee
That suddenly you wantin' me to be your wifey
You're showing how shallow you really are
Coz all this shit don't make me no superstar
Lickle name Lickle fame Up in dis game
Shit ain't changed, shit ain't changed
I'm still the same
I'm still the same girl
Who's heart you broke that day
All the love I had for you
But only disrespect did you show me

[Chorus]

Da Da Da

[Chorus]

Now you tried misusin', abusin' and usin'
Was it ammusin' when you was confusin'
And left me in sorrow
Now tell me who's in control
And it was so upsettin'
But now I'm lettin' you know
My love you ain't gettin'
I'm bettin' that you regrettin'
The day you stole that lickle piece of my soul

[Chorus x2]</pre>
