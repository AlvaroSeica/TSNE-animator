[Long Axe]
Near to the future museum on the CD
Pictures I paint on the mic for your DC
Being new form of species
Career on the rise, can't control or relieve me
Asking around, some love and some hate me
Style off the chain I guess that's why they wanna take me
Rise like the Sun through the clouds stay shining
Want a mountain of money so I can stay climbing
Music on the brain can't put a price to me
Can't go over it, can't get under it
So I go through it with no problems
Minor complications, major innovations
I let you see for yourself just listen close
This is what your Daddy said Hip Hop is missing most
Explore me the industry can never ignore me
What it really taught me is that you can not be sure of me
This is greater than the deal with the handshake
More than a video where honeys make their ass shake
There was a promise I made in '97, right
Never surrender my skills and always keep them tight
Break the mould, creative control
Cause you can't have the highs without having lows

[Chorus: Long Axe]
Some people living black highs and black lows
As a matter of fact we looking out for each other
Some people living outside, they're so cold
From where I'm looking out we gotta heel one another
And if you never satisfied, you grow old
Yo we tryna work it out so we can deal with one another
Talking about them black highs and black lows
For sure, for sure

[Long Axe]
When I was young at this, wondrous, technique was thunderous
Only those that's chosen can run with us
Hunger was eating my fear and feeding my heart beat
Folds that holds us, getting torn apart
Like an army we marched, stomped under arch
Wet wind with words, with you missing ____
Plans in flames get remembered in smoke
Handsome names get dismembered then broke, nope
Everything is close to the seed
And like an alphabet record with scratch I'm stuck on G's
I'm stuck in jeans, they said escape in these please
In joy and pain, inside the black Lois Lane
We came so far from me to being solar
Now I'm the general driving in your car
Elbow pointing out the left window
With tits so dark it's like a black instrumental
Eyes follow as the streets swallow me
Cops hung bodily, can't get apologies
For the past slavery, I must advise something savoury
I love music, but some of y'all hating me
Hate my look, hate my nose, hate my lips
Hate my rhymes, hate my mind, hate my gift
You need to move .. you get moved on
Relocated from the charts taking too long
The label you on will be the last labour you're on
I looked back cause I was able to calm
Begging to shine, but for me I am ready to climb
While others riding at a steady decline

[Chorus]</pre>
