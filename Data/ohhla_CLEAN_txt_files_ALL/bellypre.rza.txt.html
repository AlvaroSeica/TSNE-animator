Bobby.. Bobby.. Bobby.. Digital.. Digital.. Digital..
Bobby.. Bobby.. Bobby.. Digital.. Digital.. Digital..

[Intro: RZA]
{*makes that DOODOODOODOO noise over woman's voice*}
Bobby Bobby.. yo..
Belly of the beast, belly of the beast
Yo, yo

[RZA]
The murderous assault catapault lyrics from the vault
The exalted chief annointed, flows double jointed
Ointment of disappointment, opponents can't pinpoint it
The moment of microphone mystics, merciless meticulous
Verses disperse the tricks from the surface
Expose those who real and whose nervous
I'm killin your urges, I'm determined
to inject my serum, to your eardrums
Then swell them up, it's the merciless
galactic tactics, of microphone harassment
Impregnates your brain to give your head piece contractions
Rebirth the thought, Wu-Tang can't be played short
We import and export, uncut dope from New York
Like Nate who sold weight, between Monroe and Gates
Half-ounce to big cake slice to his lowest price rate
Had a deathcase at the weekend when his cousin used to freebase
A high speed chase and Gods waved in his face

[Chorus: RZA]
B-O-B-B-Y
Trapped up inside the belly of the beast got to break loose
Bobby unleashes, the craziest shit
Fuck the world fuck the peace it's..
B-O-B-B-Y
Trapped up in the belly of beast, we gotta break loose
Bobby unleashes, fuck the bloodshed
Yo slugs to your head, you won't make it past me

[RZA]
Hell.. I'm gettin sick
I bugged the fuck out when DMX fucked Taral Hicks
Make me wanna jerk my dick, jerk jerk jerk..
jerk jerk, and bust the fuck off on the next hoe's skirt
E.M.I., I'm wild like G.I., Joe - Magnum P.I.
or niggaz from C.I., on the B drinkin Knee-High
Alpha Phi, Sigma guy, NeoGeo, fuck the C.O. or the P.O.
I'm wild like the Lion Leo
It's a K.O. fuck a J-O.. B
I'm an emcee, D-M-D, W-T-C, B-C, G-P, REC posse's all in me
Live on TV.. you see the B.. O-B-B.. Y.. D-I.. G-I.. T.. A-L
can never go to jail by NY..PD
F.I.C, try to hold my money hostage
from my last deposit was one mill'
Bobby Steels gettin ill

[Break: RZA]
Still, trapped up in the belly of the beast
Fuck the world, fuck the beast
Bobby unleashes, masterpieces
when I'm trapped in the belly of the beast
And bring the war, and say fuck the beast!
What should I do?
{*makes that DOODOODOODOO noise*}

[RZA]
Immaculate attackin' pattern of track stabbin'
Imagine, pestilence, war, death and famine
Examine the swordsman, blades double-crossin'
Caution, death covers devils up like frostin'
Northern style, changin' colors like Autumn
Porcelain exotic slang, reigns through ya forum
MC's freeze from the breeze, performed by a Swarm of Killa Beez
Yo my sword can't dull a hoe
Throw, boomerang a blade that shave through ya skull
Decapitate, red alert, time to activate
My Digital signal, shit is gettin' critical

[Break: RZA]
Bobby, trapped in the belly of the beast
I must be unleashed
Robbin' Clark's, sellin' drugs, bustin' thugs
Show three-to-four bitches love at the same time
Insane mind, niggas get locked behind bars
We crash cars, shoot up bars, ghetto superstars
Tryin' to find Allah, bloods attack crews in war scars
Let's take it back to Africa
My shit niggas out of jail, niggas bail
Get more drugs to sell
Nigga put a hand on my girl
Bobby, trapped up inside the belly of the best
Must be unleashed
Robbin' Clark's, sellin' drugs and bustin' thugs
Show three-to-four bitches love at the same time
We crash cars and shoot up bars, ghetto superstars
Tryin' to find Allah, bloods attack crews in war scars
Let's take it back to Africa
{*makes that DOODOODOODOO noise*}
