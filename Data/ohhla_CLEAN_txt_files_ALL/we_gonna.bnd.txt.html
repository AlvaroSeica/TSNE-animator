[Intro: Sara + (Trackmasters)]
(It's on fire tonight) What we gonna do tonight
(It's on fire tonight) What we gettin into tonight
What we gonna do tonight
What we gettin into tonight (Trackmasters)

[Ness]
Uhh, you know what happens when your girl go out
She pop up, a month later up on Girls Gone Wild
Say cheese you on candid camera
In your birthday suit like a go-go dancer
Ain't nothin funny I ain't Jo Jo dancer, ENess
Puff L's like I promote cancer(huh)
And I ain't gotta give a pick up line, I'm a pimp so
you can kiss where the sun don't shine

[Young City]
I pull up in that platinum buggy, club hot actin lovely
In the spot where it's packed and jumpin
You can catch me in the cut tryin to wrap the
yucky-sticky-icky stuff holla at your youngin (whoop-whoop)
I'm back on it hit the macks on it
Girls love to touch and put they back on me
I don't wanna be your man
I'm into one night stands
You know we doin it big and straight boning huh?

[Chorus + (Sarah)]
[Babs Bunny]
It's more room in the V.I.P., you can come take a seat
by me (What we gonna do tonight)
Get it poppin making a love scene, plenty room in the
limousine (What we gettin to tonight)

[Fred]
Baby girl leave it up to me
I wanna bite through your pantie string (What we gonna do tonight)
Cause I got sexy things I wanna do
That'll get you in the mood indeed (What we get into tonight)

[Babs Bunny]
Rode deep to the club my truck is packed
If there ain't enough room lap it up in the back
Circle the block, pull up in the parking lot
We all smell like weed cause we spark a lot
Table reserved, chicks stand up when they see me
Flag down the waitor get an Apple Martini
All night stuntin doin it up
A bunch of bed style bitches with big ass butts

[Fred]
Could it be the snake skin with gators or the throwback Raiders
Every moment is a Kodak for the world
But tonight I'm no mack
When I match your girl the human spatula is attached to her
I snatched her up, pulled her real close to the fur
gave her a, bottle of crisp fuck a plastic cup
Let me know if we gonna bump with your sassy self cause
The Don got ass to touch, holla back

[Chorus + (Sarah)] x2
[Babs Bunny]
It's more room in the V.I.P.
You can come take a seat by me (What we gonna do tonight)
Get it poppin making a love scene
Plenty room in the limousine (What we gettin to tonight)

[Fred]
Baby girl leave it up to me
I wanna bite through your pantie string (What we gonna do tonight)
Cause I got sexy things I wanna do
That'll get you in the mood indeed (What we get into tonight)</pre>
