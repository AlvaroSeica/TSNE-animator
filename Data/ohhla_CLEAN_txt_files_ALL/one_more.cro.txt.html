Typed by: Nickolye16@aol.com 

Hey Bonnie, hand me my keys baby
  (Where you finna go?)
Psh, wherever the fuck I want to, bitch! {*door slams*}
  (Tch, niggaz ain't shit!)

[Intro: Crooked I]
Chea~!
Before one of you niggaz make a new song called "D.O.G.S."
Death of Gangsta Shit, ha ha ha ha
I just need to hear some West Coast G shit one mo' time
(Yeah yeah, just one mo' time)
Geah, just one mo' time
Put your muh'fuckin finger in the air and say (one mo' time)

[Crooked I]
Aiyyo, hardtop convertible - it's him again
When the car stop it murder you - them killer rims
Your heart stop, the seat's half suede and part croc
Paint job far from stock, this is dark chop
Hit the block with the system KNOCKIN on some extra loud ish
You tell me it's child ish
But I'm, on my Long Beach, Southern Cal' ish
And my, fuck a brrritch, young Chris Brown ish
Hahaha.. I'm only playin wit'chu
My homegirls gangbang bitch, they'll hit you
Puttin hands on a woman ain't a player's issue
I'd rather treat your emotions like they was made of tissue
(What that supposed to mean?) Guess I'm a asswipe
(Tch, FUCK YOU nigga!) Yeah, that's right
Fuck me like your friend did last night
Now go on and call her so y'all can have that catfight

[Chorus 2X: Crooked I]
Bitches know niggaz ain't shit
We cheat and lie, act like it ain't shit
So when we die, cremate us then put us in your douche
So we can run through that puss - one mo' time

[Crooked I]
Yeah, niggaz ain't shit (nope)
Reoccurin drama, with the same chick
Twenty kids in your past made with the same dick
Now it's a wrap on your present like your dick is Saint Nick
Now she talkin all loud in court
Like gettin buckwild in sport, hollerin 'bout child support
And you done paid up for e'ry kid
She spent yo' money on other niggaz and gettin her hair did
Puttin Mac makeup all on her pretty face
Just to get the money shot later from Mr. Weapon Waist
Call Reverend Ma$e, tell him that I need prayer
And ask him is it a better place for players
I'm sorry, I dig a ditch for you critics
A black Ferrari to gettin rich, I'm committed
The second comin of Ice Cube, "nigga" stitched on my fitted
Niggaz ain't shit, I admit it

[Chorus]

[Crooked I]
Yeah, one mo' time
Yeah yeah, just one mo' time (just one mo' time)
Baby one mo' time
Put your muh'fuckin finger in the air and say one mo' time

I got you haters mind puzzled
How this ghetto ass nigga thinkin like Russell
Goin independent was supposed to sink my boat
I was already afloat with my side hustle
Ice age ain't over for this Californian
But the recession hit yours like global warming
Neck look ice-less
Damnit man your bare-ass wrist look timeless, as this rhyme is
It's all about chokin chicks with my dick
Then get behind her like I'm givin her the Heimlich
{*cough cough*} Bend that tail over, ya dig?
I'm signin off, male chauvinist Pig-{face!}

[Chorus]

[Outro: Crooked I]
Yeah, my shit knockin
Chea! My shit knockin, ha ha ha
I know I'm takin hip-hop ten steps back
Fuck it, PIGFACE!

[woman]
And I'm his bitch, Bonnie</pre>
