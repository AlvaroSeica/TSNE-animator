[Intro/Chorus: Adam Levine]
My heart's a stereo
It beats for you so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every note
Ohh ohhh
Make me your radio
And turn me up when you feel low
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo

(Gym Class Heroes baby~!)

[Travie McCoy]
If I was just another dusty record on the shelf
Would you blow me off and play me like everybody else?
If I ask you to scratch my back, could you manage that?
{*imitating a scratching sound*} Travie, I can handle that
Furthermore, I apologize for any skippin tracks
It's just the last girl that played me left a couple cracks
I used to, used to, used to, used to, now I'm over that
Cause holdin grudges over love is ancient artifacts
If I could only find a note to make you understand
I'd sing it softly in your ear and grab you by the hands
Keep me stuck inside your head like your favorite tune
And know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you

[Chorus]

[Interlude]
Oh, ohh ohh
Oh - oh, ohh ohh (to my stereo)
Oh, ohh ohh
So sing along to my stereo

{Let's GO!}

[Travie McCoy]
If I was an old school fifty-pound boombox (remember that)
Would you hold me on your shoulder wherever you walk?
Would you turn my volume up in front of the cops?
And crank it higher every time they told you to stop?
And all I ask is that you don't get mad at me
when you have to purchase mad D batteries
Appreciate every mixtape your friends make
You never know, we come and go like on the interstate
I think finally found a note to make you understand
If you can hear this, sing along and take me by the hands
Keep me stuck inside your head like your favorite tune
You know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you

[Chorus] + [Interlude]

[Bridge: Adam Levine]
I only pray you never leave me behind (never leave me)
Because good music can be so hard to find (so hard to find)
I'll take your hand and hold it closer to mine (yeah)
Thought love was dead but now you're changin my mind
(Yeah, yeah, c'mon!)

[Chorus] + [Interlude]

[Outro]
It's your boy Travie
Gym Glass Heroes baby
Ah-YEAH~!</pre>
