Hook 4x
We rock from dungeons to rooftops
I rock nothin but the hits
We gets busy, busy, busy

Are you done without refirming and cutting coke
Ain't nothin nice, ain't nothin joke sheeit
I'm the reason half of y'all rewind button broke
Mentally masturbate til I'm nuttin quotes
Fifty feet of jizz until it coats niggas minds like a bitch button soaks
I'm the shit, shit happens sorta does
Now I caught a buzz and niggas know I'm nicer than they thought I was
I flow for rhyme for yours
Avoid wars but if you bringin it
Ain't no biggie like puff bad boy tours
You don't wanna ask for trouble
Don't front cause I'm one of the last to bubble
I'm payin up dues til I'm your ass'll cover
From all the studio time I spent on
To whole rhyme ciphers I sent home
But how can I be down syndrome
Shit, I ain't gon lie I want a pretty penny
And a bitch named penny that's pretty
With a skinny waist and big ass and titties
I rock for loot plus devotion
Nigga keep it real, don't make decisions with your points too
Not just emotions ya know

Hook 4x

Ya givin pounds of huggin a nigga dough
And lovin a nigga flow
But is it nice enough to back instead of dubbin a nigga? No
It's how so many dope niggas came and went
I'm sure it wasn't their main attempt
Rap legends without a remainin cent
At the games expense I see what they meant
Money can't buy happiness but shit it's one hell of a down payment
I got love for the game but have yet to find my reward
And after years this could be the last rhyme I record
Startin from scratch like chicken pox scars
To blow up and get tore down by the same niggas that made Biggie and Pac stars
Rhyme skin niggas in a form of polo and hilfiger
Grammy award winners lyrically couldn't house a field nigga
Yeah we used to love her with affection
But even since Insurrection, erection still run up in her with no protection
And skills gon' have yet to fare well
I'm bout ready to tell this bitch like next years welfare farewell

Hook 4x

Everyday it's the same question
How you get so many words to fit on a line
Like a fag that thinks with his dick, I keep shit on my mind
Like niggas affiliating italiano
The real niggas know what I'm talkin bout from new york to cali I know
The likes of y'all, I'm a astronomical
Wipe out the entire mass atomical
While laughing at your ass so comically
Is the real thugs, killas and hood dwellas
So it ain't nothin none of you wanna be goodfellas bitch niggas could tell us
You headed to our next
If you are next in line to shine
Try swallowing a bottle of tarnex and puttin reflectors on your ass rode life
You heard right, show me niggas that join the mob
I show ya jews that join Hitlers third reich
It's your turn to get ya flow circulation cut off like tourniquets
Cause I'm sending all you bitches Ike Turner kits
And sendin these freestyle braggers and rhymeskill boasters
To the bathroom masturbatin with they favorite Vakill posters
