[Big Von]
Big Von in the building straight from the Chopshop
tellin all MC's send fire to ya rap books
cuz Sly Boogy is here to take the throne
we gone take the ground
bring the spot like back to the west

[Sly Boogy]
I be the S-L-Y to the B double O
to the G to the Y, for those who don't know
with a poisonous flow
for the duece double 0
with a tray on the mic
when I get the paper I'm ghost
I been in the lab
with a pen and a pad
and a pack of zig-zags and a fat ass Indiga stash
these niggaz is mad
cuz I'm fuckin with Sway
and I'm fuckin with Tech
nothing but love and respect
just take that blunt to the chest
and a little bit of yac to the troat
and let this bump in yo deck
when you go to congrat with yo folks
steady smokin this do
got me dumb in the brain
wanna be runnin this game
it's like I'm smugglin caine
I'ma put a high slug in ya frame
and change my goverment name
when I take this muscle with aim
it's gone be nothing but pain
some of you niggaz is lame
you don't belong in this game
so you better make way
cuz this is judgement day

[Sly Boogy]
I be the S-L-Y to the B double O
to the G to the Y, for those who don't know
with a ridiculous flow
for the duece double 0
with a tray in the zone
when I get the blow in this dro

and I'm hungry as fuck
