Don't bounce it like that don't move it like that don't do it like that

[Juvenile]
Should of had you on beef from the beginning
Sipping hennessy I mean no disrespect miss yeah
I'm not hard to find in the club at all
I know you see these diamond's shining on my necklace (yeah)
You got my shit beating hard for me to control it
now all with my hand in my pocket I gotta hold it down
Your booty like misses incredible the only thing different is you move like a ghetto hoe
A shape like that can only come from chicken and vegetables
Now let me get this hoe's address and ya area code
Bossman is getting chedder on the shizzle the wrist is on chill and the feet is on sizzle
Hoe my shit rain it don't drizzle

Try to show you respect but you gunna make a nigga rush it OH

[Chorus]

[Juvenile]
Baby baby baby baby baby baby baby baby baby baby baby baby

Shorty you can sip with me shorty you can dip with me shorty

Go ahead bounce that ass 'round let it stick out
