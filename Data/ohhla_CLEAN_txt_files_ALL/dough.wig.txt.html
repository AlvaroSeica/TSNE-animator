Typed by: Cno Evil

[Intro: Shawn Wigs]
"I need dough and plenty of it"
Uh-huh, uh-huh, where that paper at?
Let me keep them little dollars, get 'em out of here
I need hundos and shit, fucking crabs...

[Shawn Wigs]
Yo, it's Wiganomics, that mean no slugger from Louisville
Staten Island, the land of hits, I get stupid bills
Dookey o's, and I don't fuck one, I fuck groups of hoes
Get 'em all wet in they pants, it's like Snoopy's nose
Lou lou flows, thousand dollar thought, I rock booster clothes
Pockets all pumped, like I stuffed them with pizza doughs
Biglet, my Othorized Clan be the spread
You know the plan, the plan is to snatch all the bread
Stack moneys, rubberband in 'em, half a million
No singles, I throw 'em in the trash, outside my building

[Outro: Shawn Wigs]
Knowhatimean? Big black bags and shit, cuz
It's like if the Feds come in, I can't be on TV
With a whole bunch of singles and shit</pre>
