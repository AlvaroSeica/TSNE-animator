[Intro]
Come and get it, girl... C'mon (Yeah-eee, yeah-ee...)
Come and get it, girl... C'mon-c'mon
Come and get it, girl... C'mon
Come and get it, girl... c'mon
 
[Chorus: woman singer]
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet
 
[Heavy D]
I'm talkin about swingy, swinga, swing with the swinger
Forget about what you heard, here coems the humdinger
And I'ma ride the beat like a jockey rides a horse
I'm the boss, hold your horse, Heavy D is on course
Pardon me, excuse me, watch it I'm a biggie
Here comes the Hevster, a good friend of Ziggy, Marley
and Eddie Murphy's brother name Charlie
If the beat is very funky, then it's made by Marley
When I was in school, sometimes I didn't study
Producer Pete Rock has a brother named Ruddy
Ruddy is my cousin, the oldest in his fam
and really really appeciates a good Jamacian jam
Me for myself, myself and for me
I like a fresh lemon mixed with honey and tea
Or a chocolate chip cookie, later on a lil' nookie
In the morning, I wake up, I'm in the bed up with my bookie
Wash my face with Ivory, girls don't connive me
When I grow up, I want a kid big just like me
No need to BOW on ya hands and knees
Just come a lil' closer, 'cause the lover's got what you need
 
[Chorus: woman singer] (Heavy D)
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet
(The lover's got what you need)
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet
 
[Heavy D]
Mister mister, pass me the muffin
The kind with the crisp that's brown like stuffing
Then while you're at it, pass the lemonade
But cut the charades, I can do without the shade
Aiyyo, make me happy, try to be snappy
I like to say "waddup" to my mammy and my pappy
My big sister Porsh', my brothers of course
My man EJ, he's a don from The Source
Then D.O.C., UFO, well the Daddy-O
Little Big Mayne on the block, playin the game of c-lo
Can't forget CL, ?Tom of KBS?
Cousins Grace and Shelly, boy those girls can dress
Little cousin Grap, then the U-M-E is Uni
Then up to Philly, what's up to cousin ?Tooey?
No need to BOW on ya hands and knees
Just come a lil' closer, 'cause the lover's got what you need
 
[Chorus]
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet (...well alright)
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet (...well alright)
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet (...well alright)
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet (...Bring it in)
 
{DJ Eddie F cuts and scratches}
 
[Chorus (This time along with a group of singers singing "I got what you need")]
 
[Heavy D]
+Mary Had a Little Lamb+, but Heavy had Mary
Some say it's a lie, but on the contrary
Sure as I'm standing here, those boots got smoked
(Yo, what happened to the little lamb~?!) -- Sheep skin coat
I ain't no joke, so you better see the joker
Won a thousand dollars last night playin poker
Look there's a cutie, I better rope-a-dope her
Treat her like a buddah, roll her up and then smoke her
Extra Extra! Read all ABOUT me
Turn to channel one, Heavy D's on TV
Look at him GO! Look at him GO! Look at him
Time to get the franks out the fridge and start cookin 'em
I'm so SMOOTH, when I walk I strut
When I run I glide, when I dip I tuck
No need to BOW on ya hands and knees
Just come a lil' closer, 'cause the lover's got what you need
