[Chorus]
There's only two ways, out, of, here
If your too late you'll be trapped here, forever
There's only two ways... out, of, here
Ones through the door, the others through Me

[Verse 1]
Sometimes livin' in a word like this
It's pretty hard not to go insane
Not pretty if you don't comply
Pretty easy if you don't complain
Stand there like you don't feel pain
No tears in the face of defeat
Pretend to the end that you don't feel change
Don't admit it that your faith is weak
Don't say that you feel like dying
Life's hard that it feels like diamonds
Go home, shit's far too gone
Much too late to even feel like trying
Can't understand what I'm saying
Can't figure out what I'm implying
If you feel you don't want to be alive
You feel just how I am..
I'm on the dark side
And you can't come find me
How? when it's light all around you
Yeah but it's dark on the inside
No win when it's me against me
One of us ain't gonna survive
My heart been broke for a while
Yours has been the one keeping me alive

[Chorus]
There's only two ways, out, of, here
If your too late you'll be trapped here, forever
There's only two ways... out, of, here
Ones through the door, the others through Me

[Verse 2]
This world's such a fucked up place
My mind's in such a fucked up shape
Everything down here sucks
Maybe what's up there is great
We all gotta go one day
I just wanna cut to the chase
I wanna stop these nightmares
I just wanna touch your face
All you see is all my feats
All I see is all my flaws
All I can hear is all my demons
Even through your applause
All you see is all my flights
All I see is all my falls
All you see is all my rights
All I see is all my wrongs
Go on keep telling me to fight
Gun on my table telling me to come on
Tellin me to put a bullet inside my head
Damn put it up right next to my jaw
Don't keep tellin me to find a reason
Anything to keep me from squeezing
Simplest things yeah you really like summer
You really like music, you really like reading
I can't win if it's me against me
One of us ain't gon survive
And my heart been broke for a while
Yours been the one keeping me alive
Yours been the one keeping me alive
Yours been the one keeping me alive

[Chorus]
There's only two ways, out, of, here
If your too late you'll be trapped here, forever
There's only two ways... out, of, here
Ones through the door, the others through Me</pre>
