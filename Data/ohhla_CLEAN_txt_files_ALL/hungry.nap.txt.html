Typed by: Cno Evil

[Intro: Napoleon]
Yeah, what the fuck is going on out here
In these muthafuckings streets, kid?
Ya'll niggas better start paying muthafuckin' homage, yo

[Chorus 2X: Joe Mafia]
You ain't ready, never steady, you ain't hungry enough
Never grinding, never shining, you ain't tougher than us
Real music hit them speakers, and it's banging them cuts
So who the realest, tell them niggas, are we hungry or what?

[Napoleon]
Ya'll dudes feeling yourself, it's not that serious
To sum it up, ya'll ain't fucking with me, period
Damn right, I sun ya'll niggas, ya'll my embryos
Mixtape, nickel and diming, we got plenty O's
Six hundred dollar a weasel, you got digit clothes
Can't even say ya'll bitches, ya'll some friendly hoes
Trying to get close to the don, but take a number
I do a song with you round, '08 December
You a killa right? Nothing but glocks in ya rhymes
How many quarts of water, go up in the pot when it's nine
You done hustled for years, on the block with a dime
Military circle mob, fake rocks ya shine
You a failure, you might as well go to work
You can't feed your family, off a O a purse
Everytime I'm in the hood, the hoes go berserk
I'm soon to be a millionaire, they suppose to flirt

[Chorus 2X]

[Joe Mafia]
Snatching skirts off a nigga, G's up, hoes down
Pull a shirt off a nigga, do a couple of rounds
Wipe the smirk off, brush dirt off, move the crowds
Change a faggot whole swagger, when them guns come out
It's the rush from the drama that's embedded in my brain
I'm figgity, can't stop moving, like I'm sniffing 'caine
Bang bang, everywhere came, we tearin' up the streets
You think it's something sweet, get lifted off your fucking feet
I know you scared of beef, we move like the sidewinder
Ain't even thinkin' that you jeopardize your fam, partner
Come off them grams, partner, I need a hundred thou'
Right now, damn Mafia, no less than eighty large
Cash, that's my last offer, meet me at the Marriot
No funny shit, I ain't gettin' the same time that Cherry got
Extortion with the licks, Air Forces with the blicks
Need court orders, issue warrants, cuz they know they bitch

[Chorus 2X]

[Napoleon]
So you wanna be a gangsta, for real? On the real, you a joke to me
Them faker weasel jeans look dirty, you broke to me
See I stay fresh, like strawberry potpourri
Scarface leathers, mink hoodie, the coke was free
To say I'm not fly, yo, you high, you done smoked a ki'
You got to have atleast a couple mill', to approach the G
The next Paul Allen, six years ya'll hope to be
Instead of Microsoft, the empire was coke and D's
Yeah I'm in exclusive jeans, soon as they quote the feed
Tear the mall up, and cop kicks like groceries
Everywhere I go, the chicks, screamin' ferociously
And I ain't even Denzel, Jigga or Jodeci
I guess they must of heard, I was that nigga, supposedly
Ice shining bright, yeah I figured you noticed me
All I really need, is some fish, an older sea
To be the first, ghetto billionaire, with no degree

[Chorus 2X]

[Outro: Napoleon]
Yeah, real niggas, we here nigga
Cap, Drum, Rascal, Mike Williams, Kenny B
We here nigga, ah-hah!</pre>
