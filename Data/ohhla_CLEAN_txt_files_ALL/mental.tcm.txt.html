[Prelude: The Ambassador]
God's viewpoint, that's what heaven's mentality is
It's synonymous with the biblical term "the mind of Christ."
Thinking like he thinks about everything
And the bible does speak about everything
And it's the final authority on it
Get your Christ on... .(yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!)
Come on fellas!혬

[Chorus]
Yeah I got it, yeah I want it
Yeah I need it, yeah I'm on it
Yeah I like this, it's the hypest
It's the brand new mind of the righteous
[2x]

[The Ambassador]
Feel the vibe of a new wave of thought
We fall short but the lord god pays child support. 
'Caught up in the rapture of love'
A whole family that's been bought by the blood
And a new mindset is what God gives them
Brand new rules and new tools for the livin' 
On this earth encased in a dirt prison
A new talk with the cross sought as the wisdom
I stopped wishin' for the 'ole time religion
Now I'm drawn to the Bread of Life like a pigeon 
The Risen Son, He's the reality
So make way y'all for Heaven's Mentality

[Chorus]

[The Ambassador]
It really gets to me
How the world rejects the God of history
Knowing it's the tree that gives the victory
And it's the key that unlocks the voice box to say, "love lifted me혬
Now it's the three, person identity called the Trinity, rollin' for infinity
But you know we love death not life
Wrong not right, dark not light
It's called depravity, it's rotten like a cavity
Don't get mad at me, sin's got the gravity
Pulling us down, every life form
All the way from Adam to the last life born
On and on and only through bloodshed
Could sin be turned to snow white from blood red
Someone said, "life's a 'b' then you die혬
That's because you're not reborn, realize
Accept Christ, and new life is imparted
Biblecentric thought is the target (buh!)
And what this breeds is
God pleasers yeah fanatics for Jesus! 
Watch us come down
It's the believers who's stompin' ya town
Rippin' it for Jesus
And The Cross Movement represents lovely
Not too concerned with what you think of me
I break out like an allergy
And indeed I see the need for the bleedin' at Calvary
So while Christ hangs in your art gallery
Mad souls are being lost like a calorie
So it's time to go public for He who
Is the light with the keen sight that can see through
All of the modern day pharisees
'The author and the finisher' of Heaven's Mentality!

[Interlude]
"Heaven's Mentality: thinking God's thoughts
For 'His thoughts are not our thoughts
His ways are not like our ways.'"

[Chorus]

[The Ambassador]
Don't panic, don't get frantic, understand it
Single handedly the Three rule the planet
And it's the "Triune Clique혬
That rose thick that our crew gets wit'
We do be quick to make a duplicate copy
Bondservants of the same God we serve
All up in his word, so we got the
Knack to put Christ in ya cypha', ya circle
The word flows everywhere we go
Universal-ly, we be free servin' God you can see these
Lives bein' watched by the world like TV's
As we represent, the True King Excellent
Not a next event, He rules in the present tense
The I am, I slam for the savior
Incarnate flava', the Alpha Omega
The Bleeda' the Infinite Leader, the whole
Wide world's Judge and Redeemer of souls
Check the avenue, Cross Movement's grabbin' you
Not a braggin' crew
We just want to tap into ya mental
State of credentials
Of a man with a better life insurance plan than Prudential
Plus, trust, follow him like a stencil
The joint, always on point like a pencil
Get this new mind and flaunt it
Once you got it, you want it, you need it, you on it!

[Chorus]
[2x]

Yeah, I got it!</pre>
