[Hook: Kizzo]
I come from, Break A Bitch University
If you ain't got do' for me, then hoe just let me be
Call me a break a bitch, magnum kuloddi
A scholar for spitting pimping, motivation for your body

[Talent]
All I can be, is me
And all I be, is a P-I-M-P
And that, will never change
Cause I'm still, pimping these dames

[Congo]
I'm trying to get you motivated, trying to get you on my level
The game you talking is over rated, I'm a spitting pimping devil
Ay if you think that you can talk it, with the best of em
Then bring that big ol' booty to fuck with some pimping, like the rest of em
I heard you giving head shots, and letting niggaz hit for free
I got three degrees of pimping baby, I'm talking a P.H.D.
So listen to the doctor, when he spits this citation
It's ok to use your mouth piece, and it all start with your conversation
Like daddy here's your cash, and I'm going to get some more for you
And that's the shit that I like to hear, when I'm lecturing in my classroom
Sometimes you got to rehearse it, and reverse it
You don't curse it, you willing to be the coldest freak there is working

[Hook]

[Talent]
All I can be, is me
And all I be, is a P-I-M-P
And that, will never change
Cause I'm still, pimping these dames

[Billy Cook]
Do what it do baby, let's get a room baby
Let me hit it real slow, so I can hear you call me daddy
Ten toes up, and ten toes down
I like the way you take charge, put it in your mouth
You's a freak baby, so bust it open baby
It's Billy Cook Superstar, that's how I roll daily
Ooh three point stance, got me in a trance
Side to side poetry, in motion make it dance
Baby keep it trill, let me get a bill
Do it sideways, baby show me them skills
Japanese Chinese, and all kinds of 'nese
Just the way I like 'em baby, go and get my cheese

[Hook]

[Talent]
All I can be, is me
And all I be, is a P-I-M-P
And that, will never change
Cause I'm still, pimping these dames

[Billy Cook]
I got hoes, in different area codes
I'm a first chaser, Escallde I'm tipping on 4-4's
Stepping out the finest of pimp clothes, all this all a nigga knows
From the Himallayahs to the East and West Coast, I pimp  H-O-E-S
Up in all suites yeah you know me never show the I.D., cause I be's a G
Up in the club spitting my game like a true mack, space age pimping like Ball and G
Y'all tip foreign cars, ain't nothing to it dog
I'm a ghetto superstar, and that's on the real showing my skills and keeping it raw
Collecting my pimpering chips, breaking these hoes tricks and simps
Just label me a magnum kuloddi, break a bitch pimp
It's Billy Cook Superstar, and I'm all about my cheese
If you ain't got my money, then hoe let me be

[Hook]

[Talent]
All I can be, is me
And all I be, is a P-I-M-P
And that, will never change
Cause I'm still, pimping these dames

(*talking*)
Ha-ha yeah, it's never over
Till the fat lady sings, believe that iight</pre>
