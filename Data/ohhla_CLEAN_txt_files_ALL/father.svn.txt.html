[Intro]
Uh yeah, Forgive me lord
Uh, Cmon, Yeah, Uh
Listen to me

[Verse]
This is the prayer of a hard weight heavy
I'm in a sea of depression, Please lord, Let my ship stay steady
Cause I ain't ready, To be devoured by the mouth of death
My cup of faith runs full, Now half-ounce's left
So I count my breaths and hold my own
Hopin satan ain't stole my throne
I know, All too well, What it's like to be young and poor
When everyday is as dark as the one before
And I just wanna be like you
Step out onto the surface of this water lord, And then run to shore
Would you meet me at the bank of the sea?
For a hug, Be as anxious as me?
I gotta know, Cause everyday is a fight to win
When you're surrounded by triflin men
Sometimes I feel I'm worth nothin more than just my mic and pen
I need you in my life again
Forgive me lord</pre>
