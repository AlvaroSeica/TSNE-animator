[Lady talking]
Ladies and gentlemen, here comes the stone rockers
I mean some real playas
But tonight, they gon' do it all in together

[Fred Durst talking]
Uh, check on, uh
Limp Bizkit

[Fred Durst (Method Man)]
Uh
Who could be the boss
Look up to the cross
Stranded in the land of the lost
Standin up I'm sideways
I'm blazin' up the path
Runnin' on the highways of rap
Choked up by the smoke and the charcoal
Lava stamps then brands me like a bar code
I'm bashin' all the media strikes
To keep the media dykes
As reinforcements for the fight
And that alone'll keep John Gotti on the phone
I'm tangled in the zone
I got the bees on the track
Where the fuck you at (Tical!)
Let me hear you pigeons run ya mouth now (Shut the fuck up)
I'm pluggin' in them social skills
That keep my total bills over a million
The last time I checked it
Thank God I'm blessed with a mind that'll wreck it
Wait until the second round and knock em' out

[Method Man]
They call me Big John Stud
My middle name Mud
Dirty water flow
Too much for you thug
And can't stand the flood
What up Doc, hold big gun like Elmer Fudd the sureshot
Mr. Meth I'm unplugged (Unplugged)
Temperatures too hot for sunblock (Burn)
Playin' with minds
That get you state time
Locked behind 12 bars from a great mine
Killa bees in the club with his ladybug
Brought a sword to the dance floor to cut a rug
Love is love all day
Till they throw slugs
And take another life in cold blood
Can't feel me till its your blood
Murder rates tremendous
Crime is endless
Same shit different day
Father forgive us
They know not what they do
All praise is due
I'm big like Easy
And Big Bamboo

[Hook: Pharrell William (Method Man &amp; Fred Durst) x2]
Whats that, I didn't hear you (Shut the fuck up)
Come on, a little louder (Shut the fuck up)
Everybody in together now (Shut the fuck up)
What huh (Shut the fuck up)
Oh (Shut the fuck up)

[Method Man]
Headstrong, dead calm, get it right on
Dead weight to dead wrong, let's get it on
Twelve rounds I throw down, who hold crown
Protect land with 4 pound, Limp Bizkit
Get around like merry-go, bust a scenario
Comin' through your stereo, why risk it
Lifestyles of the prolific and gifted
8 essential vitamins and minerals delicious
Word on the street is, they bit my thesis
Knocked out they front teefers, tryin to taste mine
Actin like they heard it through the grapevine
Dope fiendin for the bassline 2 for 5 rhyme
Pharmaceuticals, hard as nails to the cuticles
Where you find that monster she beautiful
Wu-Tang and Limp Bizkit roll on the set
Kick a hole in the speaker pull the plug and inject

[Fred Durst]
Mic check
So what's it all about (Bout)
And where we gonna run (Run)
Maybe we can meet up on the sun
Discretion is advised
For the blood of virgin eyes
We limpin' on the track with the Method
So get the sunblock (Sunblock)
You gettin' one shot (Ha)
Until you dissolve
I revolve
Around everything you got
From outta nowhere
Prepare
You be blinded by the glare
I told you not to stare
Now you're turned into stone
Without a microphone
But don't you forget you're in a zone (So shut the fuck up)
And take that shit back
Cause all your shits wack (Doo doo is doo doo)
When its weighed out like that
Burnin' up your brain like a piston
So all those that didn't listen
Now they even knew what they were missin'
And never even knew that the sky was fallin' down
Wu-Tang Clan for the crown

[Hook x4]

[Method Man to fade]
It was over your head
All day and every day
S.I., N.Y. 10304
Wu-Tang Killa Bees
And the Limp B-I-Z-K-I-T
Y'all know the time
Y'all know the rhyme
It ain't easy bein' greasy in a world full of cleanliness
And, you know, all that other madness
We gone, peace

Limp Bizkit
Method Man
Rock the house y'all
Bring it on</pre>
