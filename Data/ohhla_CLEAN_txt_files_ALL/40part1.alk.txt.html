Lazy-ass gentlemans.. may I have yo' drunk-ass attention please
Comin to you motherfuckers live on stage here tonight
I'd like to present.. the most intoxicated, most inbreezeiated
Most anpissipated, group of our time - the 40 Oz, Quartet
Take it away, gentlemans

[J-Ro]
It's the cap twistin clique that get you sick off one sip
of this concoction - pass it to a nigga like Stockton
Grape juice, Johnny Walker, Olde E, and Hennesey
So much Remi in my kidney they had to send me to Sidney
to find a remedy, from drinkin kegs all alone
I wish they'd leave my head alone, I'm just an alkie to the bone
They try to send me to AA, I said "Ay ay!"
Not today-day, I just bought a bottle of Tan-gueray-ray
But first I gots to finish, my eight ball and Guinness
I'm feelin so dry now man, I must replenish
Ohhhh I like the gurrrls with the fat backs
But I be so damn wet I never get a chance to smack that
Straight out of order sign on the weenie
Wasted chips buyin a bitch a gang of apple martinis

I'm.. just.. a drunk (I can't help myself)
I'm.. just.. a drunk (Drinkin X.O. off the top shelf)
I'm.. just.. a drunk (No I can't help myself)
I'm.. just.. a drunk-k
