[Ev] Oh no~!
{A-A-A-Al-Al-Al-Al-Alchemist}
[Ev] You gotta let this breathe for a minute
[Ev] Just let it breathe

[Evidence]
(Talk to 'em) There's a reason why my friends did cocaine
I sat home at night, tryin to get my biggest pro game
Slow and low, what happened was this
I stayed on my grind, and everything else became last on my list
Let my birds go, go 'head, fly away
The ones that don't come back ain't meant to be caged
It's a brand new day (yes) I'm a brand new me
Change the # on my cell and on the brand new street
I don't wanna keep in touch, I just wanna start fresh
And ain't afraid to die but still got a little left to give
This, Evidence Alchemist hits
Live and direct, no price tag could cover the trip
Shit is the truth, and this is undisputable proof
So understand where we stand in negotiatin loot
Right now you got the two best chefs who got the recipe
This the main course, the weed sold seperately

[Chorus: Phonte]
Aiyyo I'm all about elevatin
I'm on the grind tryin to get mine instead of waitin
So why you hesitatin? (Let yourself go, let yourself go)
(Let yourself go, let yourself go)
If you ain't got a plan, then you are not a man
If you ain't hustlin then we gon' have a problem fam
(Let yourself go, let yourself go)
(Let yourself go, let yourself go)

[Alchemist]
It's the rhythm jackin, honey slappin, long money bums
I come from Cali cause that's where I'm from
It's the pocket, I'm sittin on top of the snare drum
Full circle, now I'm right back to square one
Some rappers had the game in a smash now they're done
It's crazy how they go just as fast as they come
We were little kids, writin raps, just tryin to have fun
Kickin punchlines and bangin on the table at lunchtime
Now it's the field of rap, they got us all on the frontline
Used to get butterflies in my stomach before showtime
But now I just stand and deliver it
Cause Beni said always make better and bigger shit (ABB)
I'm just perfectin it, I'm not the one who invented it
All this money I'm spendin it, not the person who printed it
The money never motivate, it's just an incent-ti-tive
You tryin to get it like that, your options are limited

[Outro: Phonte]
Aiyyo I'm all about elevatin
I'm on the grind tryin to get mine instead of waitin
So why you hesitatin? (Let yourself go, let yourself go)
(Let yourself go, let yourself go)
If you ain't got a plan, then you are not a man
It's Evidence, A-L-C, we got a problem fam
(Let yourself go, let yourself go)
(Let yourself go, let yourself go)
Uhh, Phon' Tigga, Evidence and A-L-C
Most definitely, we keep it.. we run it..
We do it.. we gun it..
My nigga Evidence whattup (whattup)

[Evidence]
It's the Weatherman, landin in your area
Who said it doesn't rain in Southern California?
Man they crazy
Stay on my grind...</pre>
