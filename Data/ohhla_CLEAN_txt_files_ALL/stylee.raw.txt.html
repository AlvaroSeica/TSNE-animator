Hip hip hip-a-hip-hooray, DJ Fuse is here to stay
Raw Fusion DJ, hey hey!
Hip hip hip-a-hip-hooray, DJ Fuse is here to stay
Raw Fusion DJ, hey hey!

You say you're new to the style that's worth your while
Prepare to come follow me now
Money is givin you 'nuff of the stuff
and I'm pumpin it wicked and w-ild {*cough*}
You're new to the style that's worth your while
Prepare to come follow me now
Invitin you down where the writing's exciting
enlightening the gun POW
Sty-leee, sty-leee - what does it mean when it seems
that everyone in the game CLAIMS
to be number one and some of the think the wackness is the newest
And none of the ten MC's out there
shot and popped and failed to prove this to me
Cause style-a-style is a style, and even a child knows this
Raw Fusion is what I call this one folks and it's the antidote
Been rockin the wack, attackin the pack of newjacks I get the flak from
Umm, ahh, you're shakin and givin me the fits and so I black one
Cause some of the peoples scrupulous
schooled in just stuff I'm paintin
They're tugiin and pokin and pullin and jokin
and all of their heated debatin
But Clinton's funk they all should wear with me
They say HOW Ron?
I tell them Styleetron they stop and stare
and say wow Ron!
What is it where is it what does it do
and how did you learn to use it?
I tell 'em all it's the nucleus and only DJ Fuse gets
the props for havin the chops to operate in how to use this
The birds, the bees, and the trees, and all of the
loops and breaks he chooses
get added, splice, purified, may the lightning
from the Styleetron strike me down if I lied
The chain reaction packs a hell of a punch and such we did so much
to christen DJ Fuse the bio-stylee technician, so..

Hip hip hip-a-hip-hooray, DJ Fuse is here to stay
Raw Fusion DJ, hey hey!
Hip hip hip-a-hip-hooray, DJ Fuse is here to stay
Raw Fusion DJ, hey hey!

Stylee of DJ Fuse and Money B
The Styleetron rests in total expressive FREEDOM
Examine, your, options

Now, I go with the flow, the show low, he'll stick ya stick ya
And runnin off styles for miles and I'll, get wicked witcha
Me takin a fall CHILD PLEASE, now pick a picture
that I can not imagine cause I'm smashin ya and I'll admit ya
gave it a nice try, but nice guys, they finish last
Now stand still tobacco pants and let me SMOKE ya ass
It's been a long day and I've been fiendin for a booty HA
I need to hear ya like a coochie needs the cooties
Try to be tough, and give up, you snap a head instead of talkin that
stuff, straight out cause I'll leave rappers dead I'm cock-strong
You're wrong, if you think Ron won't wreck shit I get busier
than a one-legged man in a butt-kickin contest
My mind, is sort of like attackin if you check it
you would find, that I could hit you with the clip don't trick
cause I've no time, shoo fly don't bother me
Don't even try to be startin jack shit
Cause I flip you get hit quick
Get slapped like that, you get curled like a bicep
And flies get swatted - you want beef?  I got it
In the freezer with the wine, before we take a sip
here's a toast to you.. sucking my dick!

	.. you're on my dick but you can't have it..
	.. you're on my dick but you can't grab it!!..

"Fuck you.  You're an asshole.  Fucking jerk.
 Eat shit.  Eat shit.  You're an asshole.  Eat shit."</pre>
