[Consequence]
Now how we 'sposed to really carry on as a item
If you got more baggage than a carry-on item
And all you do is carry on and try to ignite him
Which leads me to think that you really don't like him
But let me find out that she ain't into the kid
Man I tell her I'm from Tribe, so I Indian-give
Go while she gettin shoes with the bag that matches
The only thing she gave me I could wear are scratches
So now when I catch her out in NYC
I got a formula I use called XYZ
Cause she was 'sposed to be my ex, and I kept sayin why?
'Til I pulled up in that Z, now I just drive by and say

[John Legend]
What you makin that bass for? And what you makin that face for?
I'm tired of you accusin me, it's not the way it is supposed to be
There'll be days like that, there'll be days like this
When we start out mad, and we wind up pissed
Can we go and do that all day? Now the only thing I can say
Is that I...

[Chorus]
Wish you could read my mind, wish you could take some time
To listen to me, I wish you believed, and then you would see that I
I don't know what I ever did to you {*2X*}
To make you feel this way {*2X*} ay~!
I don't know what I ever did to you {*2X*}
To make you feel this way {*2X*} ay~!

[John Legend]
Yeah yeah...
Say they seen me here, and they seen me there
With a light-skinned girl with some wavy hair
Now you know that shit just ain't true
I would never do that to you
If that's the way you feel you can play the field
And maybe then you'll see
That you'll never find a man like me
You'll be comin back I guarantee, and I...

[Chorus]

[Consequence]
It's like down to two hands when you dealin with 'Quence
Cause soon as I get right that's when they get left
And the opposite sex say that I'm a living legend
So of course the next step they wanna live with the legend
So now I got 'em Pledge'n like the furniture spray
Just to be with me at night she try to murder the day
And I go further to say, that I created a monster
Sorta like the prostitute that played in Monster
Cause once she found out I had chicks on my roster
Her lip puffed up like she's allergic to lobster
While we be slurpin pasta at a table for two
All I hear is accusations 'bout the things that I do
That I lie, that I cheat, about the dimes that I meet
Makin rounds in the street, or out of town on the creep
So believe what you will but what's revealed today
Is I ain't never tried to make you feel this way, word

[John Legend]
Loving you, is all I want to do
But that's so hard to do, with the things you put me through
I said loving you, is all I want to do
But that's so hard to do, with the things you put me throughhhhhh

I don't know what I ever did to you {*2X*}
To make you feel this way {*2X*} ay~!
I don't know what I ever did to you {*2X*}
To make you feel this way {*2X*} ay~!</pre>
