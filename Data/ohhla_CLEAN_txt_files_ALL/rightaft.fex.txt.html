[Intro: Phonte]
We've got a thing, and everybody knows
But the night is young and pretty girl I'm ready to go
So ride out, hey!

[Chorus: Sy Smith]
Don't wanna play cool, and don't wanna play shy
Don't wanna break rules, and don't wanna waste time
Maybe I could be yours, and you could be mine
If we're behind closed doors, right after midnight

[Phonte]
Pretending I don't see you, while we're on the floor
Wishing I could lead you, into something more
Your eyes are feeding my curiosity
why is this happening? Man, listen... I say baby.. 
You looking good but I can't play this game all night
And if you want me to sang it again, I'll say baby
Heh, I like the way you move and girl you're just my type
Just my type, lover - so ride out, hey!

[Chorus]

[Phonte]
We've got a thing, and everybody knows
But the night is young, and we're dancing close
And I've been waiting, and imagining
All the love we're making -  Maaaan, look~! So I say baby
Yo, you looking good but don't just take this as a sign
And if you want me to sing it again, then I say baby
Just wanna know what can I do to make you mine, lover
Make you mine, lover - so ride out, hey!

[Chorus]

[Phonte + Sy Smith]
All across the world b-boys and girls
We let 'em know that the party don't stop
Make dollars, make cents, fly ladies and gents
We let 'em know that the party don't stop
Party people in the street, time to move ya feet
We let 'em know that the party don't stop
B-girls, b-boys, y'all make some noise
We let 'em know that the party don't stop

[Phonte]
Woo~! Hey (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-oooooh-oooh)
Yeah, ooh yeah, can you feel it baby?
Can I feel you baby? Oh.. Ooh, just gimme your love

[Outro: Sy Smith - Repeat 6X]
Just gimme, gimme your love
Just, just gimme your loving, babe</pre>
