It's Jibbs ladies and gentlemen

And I'ma do it like we did it in high school
And send my dedication on my favorite station

Ay DJ, ay DJ, ay DJ (play that song for her)
Ay DJ, ay DJ, ay DJ (play that song for her)
Ay DJ, ay DJ, ay DJ (play that song for her)

[Jibbs]

used to walk home nothin to ride to
no car but I heard the radio playin my favorite song for you?

how we used to pass notes and now I be passin money
And I know that yall fake cuz baby you are the truth
so turn your speakers up this next ones for you

[chorus]

[Jibbs]
it ain't nothin like the old days
listening to them old days
then when you role play while you listening to O'Jays
I remember that night in prom
when they played our favorite song
in the back of my jeep first time
you told me you wanted to bone bone bone
foggin up the windows writtin my name in it
now the days passed it ain't the same is it
do you remember that yeah I remember too
so turn your speakers up this next ones for you

[Chorus]

[Jibbs]
