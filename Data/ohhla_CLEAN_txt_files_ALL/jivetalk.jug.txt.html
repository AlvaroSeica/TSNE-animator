Blasi blah blah blasi blah blah blasi blah [X6]

[Chorus]
J to the I to the V to the E to the 
T to the A to the L to the K (with "blase blah's" in background)
[X4]

So what you sayin, kid, you but you 
Sprayin niggas means saliva messy slobberin 
(I know you got soul!) 
From my Timmies 
When you test me clobberin these niggas easy 
See I hunger for ya talkin shit, you please me when you say ya shit is butter 
Poor excuse for the use of noise 
Slaughterin there'll be no truce 
Ya boys'd break ya jaw if they ya peoples 
To stop ya yap from playin Doc Kevorkian 
I'll lock ya talk see then commence the mercy killin cause ya mental's dead
Ya verse be still intensely showin you gots love for the game
Maybe if you playin tennis cause you mista menace 
Wicked, crazy hard 
To listen to without my finger flyin to the fast forward button 
Cause ya feeble ass flowin nothin new 
Nothin new and cuttin through we be the Juggaknots 
If you know the deal then you gots to keep it real... far away 
Secluded from my vision on the hush
and any effort towards rebuttal leads to crushin feeble niggas with the jivetalk

[Chorus X4]

Ayo I heard you comin out
The closet deposit ya masculinity
Ya guts, the hair on ya chest, ya scrawny nuts
Nigga run ya manhood 
I takes ya average dropping bombs joker 
Till the family jewels will be locked in ya mom's choker 
Leavin niggas jelled but I never thought the KY 
And when you say, "I gots ya back," you tryin to hit the hay 
I never knew the static could be so traumatic so I cut em slack
And everybody singin "Who's the Mack" and "Tryin to be a Player" 
Bridge yaself and rascal
Getting crazy ass 
Whip ins I gets hostile when a brotha know he fly 
But to me reminiscent of Jeff Goldblum, fallin apart
Breakin as the Brewin's in ya soul, dooms are given 
And driven by the stress
Thoughts are deep 
Throatin my quotin but the Juggaknots'll never fail to peep 
Ya style's corny just a horny slob
Talkin bout you gettin laid off
and then you best to get a fuckin job but not the jivetalk

[Chorus X4]

Well then there're times I can't front ya style's milk 
Curdlin close to cottage cheese
With ya verbal and ya boast of knowledge 
Please, kid, I know ya style's def 
Cause you couldn't possibly be hearin loud and clear and mean the shit you sayin 
Quit ya playin cause ya thought is nothing 
Only around the edges you be rough 
And in comparison I'm only catchin L's when I puff em 
From the strictly raw (Jog into hooker style) 
Ya joints hot (And I'm bettin your condition took a while after clinic visits) 
During which the master cynic blizzards 
As a rain storm and flushin out those cockier than Jordan, for the swing and miss
0 for 4, no rapport, bringin pissed feelings to the enemy 
So nigga buy serenity 
(My style's dope) 
Fiendish 
Paranoid, can't cope, squeamish 
Knowin that the Juggaknots stalkin, jivetalkin 
If y'all still ain't understandin me, let's get on down
In ya case, on ya hand and knee, defeated

[Chorus X5, end with "blase blah's"]</pre>
