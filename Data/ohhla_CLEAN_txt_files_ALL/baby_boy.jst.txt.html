Typed by: Cno Evil

[Chorus: King Just w/ G4 vocals]
Baby boy, oh, you my pride and joy
Things were great, and that's why I'm singing this song
To let you know, that I will never let you go
My pride and joy, my only reason for living, my baby boy

[King Just]
Hey little man, what's the deal, how you feel
I'm in the jungle, and everything out here is real
Kids packing steel, not caring who they kill
Your mother's on some dumb shit, she OD'd on the pills
Killah Hill 10304, where your old man's hang
In the spots, with jiggies kickin' down the door
Breaking laws, so you and mom duke can get yours
That's why I go on tour
I saw things that I wouldn't let your eyes see
I done things, man, that you wouldn't believe
But that don't mean, you can turn around and do the same thing
Recognize and realize, you the son of a King
Yeah, they talk about me, but I don't hear what they say
I'm in your heart, mind and soul, each and every day
And I'mma make 'em pay, for taking you away
As I lay on my bed, with your picture, I say

[Chorus 2X]

[King Just]
How could this be, they wanna separate us?
I feel like my whole world just been crushed
I bum rush, for the whole world, I hate you
Cuz I made it, yet you wanna buy my tape and play it
Hypocrites make me sick, that's why my mom copped bricks
And made flips, so I can make more hits
Hey little man, don't worry, we'll be together real soon
God don't like ugly, so the'll whole future's doomed
Where's the pain, I feel my stress building
I can't see my boy grow up and play with other children
It's killing me like a murder crime
I know one song can make up for long lost time
But you rhyme, and let nobody else tell you different
I miss you little mister, that's word to your unborn sister
I'm here to let you know who's the real mccoy
And you and nobody else, it's who?

[Chorus 2X]

[King Just]
You're older now, understand what I'm saying?
You see your daddy's out there, you know I'm not playing
I'm praying, to the only one up above
Cuz I know their evil ways can't overcome my love
But if you push come to shove, I'mma shove push back
Cuz if I die tomorrow, then it won't be no coming back
Think about that, another black man gone
Same old song, that's why I need for you to be strong
So you can live long, and prosper
With a mansion on the hill, eating on some shrimps and lobster
Like a mobster, a family bond, between me and you
Something I ain't have with my pop dukes
But that ain't stop me from becoming a star
I hope you understand and realize who you are

[Chorus 2X] </pre>
