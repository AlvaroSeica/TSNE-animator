[Intro: B.o.B]
We don't get down like y'all
No no no-no no n-n-n-no-no, no no n-no n-no-no
No no no-no no n-n-n-no-no
We don't get down like y'all
Sucka nigga, we don't get down like y'all

[T.I.]
Hey, it's been a lot of back and forth over this and that
So I don't pick the vocal no more, I just give the facts
Listen pimpin, let me tell you what the business is
Y'all and us, I'ma tell you what the difference is
See we old school, you just old news
We used to move blow, and you just blow dude
See we the talk of the town, me and my whole crew
You run around town gossip like the hoes do
See you name drop when nobody knows you
We get them lames out our section like we 'posed to
My crew we cop the Bentley, Brooklyn and the Rolls too
You give her roses, I'm the one she bring the rose to
So you, say you shinin well I guess I'm shinin more
So high up I'm soarin, 30 and I'm like a dinosaur
Carnivore, meat eater, G's they respect
Me to you like comparin a vet to a cadet, nigga

[Chorus: B.o.B]
We don't get down like y'all
I ball, I do, you talk
I'm real, you flawed
Pussy nigga, we don't get down like y'all
Sucka nigga, we don't get down like y'all

[T.I.]
Don't call it a comeback, again right, bein from the Fed pen'
Pull up on them suckers, pop the trunk and tell 'em get in
Heh, thought I lost a step, well guess again
Back to ballin, gettin bread, bring the checks in
Yeah, like we did on my last case
I show you how to make a blessing out a bad break
Ay, let me set you niggaz ass straight
Hoes want they clothes back, listen up fag bait
Them hot pants bad for your prostate
Lime green, hot pink or drag queen, hot date
At stores askin for the same size the bitches buy
They say it's hip but where I'm from we call it sissyfied

[Chorus]

[T.I.]
Ay, before us there were none, after us no more there'll ever be
This the greatest show on Earth you'll ever see
I still it for my niggaz in the streets, get into it
Blowin money like my nigga Big Meech just to do it
Say we blowin money fast, big ol' money bag
Three, fo' hundred cash just to make them suckers mad
Back in the saddle, the winner of every battle
Been the best since I was rappin in the rattle, word travel
As you, comment on the rumors or what have you
Beware dude, prayer can't prepare you, how dare you
disrespect my presence? Peasants I will tear you
a new one, I poop on your egos and move on
Rolls Royce, back seat, no Grey Poupon
A true don, three-piece posh lil' suit on
Peons, see it ain't no neon in my new Ones
Hear the truth on every song I spew on
Blaow~! Hah!

[Chorus]

[Outro: B.o.B]
No no no-no no n-n-n-no-no, no no n-no n-no-no
No no no-no no n-n-n-no-no
We don't get down like y'all
Sucka nigga, we don't get down like y'all

[T.I.]
Pussy nigga! {*laughing echoes*}</pre>
