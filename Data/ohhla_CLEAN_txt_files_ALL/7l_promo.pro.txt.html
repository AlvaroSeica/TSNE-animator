Now I'll elaborte with precise detail
As I collaborate on this mic and prevail
So 7L cut the record, the sound has been selected
The formula's perfect, all frauds have been ejected
from this project at hand, so take a second reflect
Sound Providers on deck, always comin correct
So yo bro drop the needle as I shoot from the 3
Chosen speaker's got the flow as everybody can see
SD the residential with rock rhyme potential
Bless the brother 7L just to add to my credentials
Off of that we keep it simple, no need for all the hype
I'd rather stimulate the mental with the words that I write
Precise is the ability, microphone agility
As to my charm when I'm rockin the facility
So I'ma let you know who's runnin the show
See they call him 7L and I'm the one Sound Pro

No doubt
Sound Providers rock swell with my man 7L
Cali to Boston, it's like that</pre>
