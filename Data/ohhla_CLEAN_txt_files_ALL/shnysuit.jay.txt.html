[Intro: Jay Electronica]
One two, one two, yeah, uh huh, yeah!

[Chorus: Jay Electronica]
Im sailin on a cloud, they trailin below
My shrink told me its a feelin theyll never know
I pack up all my sins and I wear em to the show
I let em go, let em go, let em go, let em go
Im sailin on a cloud, they trailin below
My shrink told me its a feelin theyll never know
I pack up all my sins in every L that I blow
I let em go, let em go, let em go, let em go

[Verse One: Jay Electronica]
In the land before time, a land before altar boys
Synagogues and shrines, man was in his prime
Look how far I go in time just to start a rhyme
The method is sublime you get blessed with every line
Im in touch with every shrine from Japan to Osaka
Your melonated carbon dated phantom of the Chakras
Me and Puff we was chillin in Miami
He said nigga fuck the underground you need to win a Grammy
For your mama and your family they need to see you shined up
You built a mighty high ladder let me see you climb up
Nigga what you scared of?!
Terrorize these artificial rap niggas and spread love, pollinate the ear buds
Like you supposed to, spit it for the culture
Pay no attention to the critics and the vultures
They rather have a shot of Belvy just to spite you
They cast the judgments cause they feel they got the right to
Fuck em!!! I let the dice roll like my father did
I gotta shine its in my blood Im a Harlem kid
I treat my babies right, treat my ladies lady like
Hit em with a remix, then make sure that they play me twice
I thought you said its the return of the black kings
Luxurious homes, fur coats and fat chains

[Chorus: Jay Electronica]
Im sailin on a cloud, they trailin below
My shrink told me its a feelin theyll never know
I pack up all my sins and I wear em to the show
I let em go, let em go, let em go, let em go
Im sailin on a cloud, they trailin below
My shrink told me its a feelin theyll never know
I pack up all my sins in every L that I blow
I let em go, let em go, let em go, let em go

[Verse Two: Jay-Z]
In this manila envelope the results of my insanity
Quack said I crossed the line between real life and fantasy
Can't it be the same went on covers with Warren Buffett
Was duckin the undercovers, was warring with mu'fuckers!!!
Went from warrin to Warren, undercovers to covers
If you believe in that sort of love your screws need adjustin
In the, world of no justice and black ladies on the back of buses
Im the Immaculate Conception of rappers slash hustlers
My God, its so hard to conceive
But it all falls perfect Im like autumn is to trees
Uh, the doc interrupted, he scribbled a prescription for some Prozac
He said take that for your mustard
Boy you must be off your rocker
if you think youll make it off the strip before they 'Pac ya
Nigga you gotta be psychotic or, mixin somethin potent with your vodka
It takes alot to shock us but you bein so prosperous is preposterous
How could this, nappy headed boy from out the projects
Be the apple of Americas obsession?
You totally disconnected with reality, dont believe in dreams
Since when did black men become kings?

[Verse Three: The-Dream]
You have no idea, yeah, the means to what I say
And you have no idea, of how I got this way
Now fear my dreams, and by the time you wake
Ill look down from the clouds, see Im, on my way

[Chorus: Jay Electronica]
Im sailin on a cloud, they trailin below
My shrink told me its a feelin theyll never know
I pack up all my sins and I wear em to the show
I let em go, let em go, let em go, let em go
Im sailin on a cloud, they trailin below
My shrink told me its a feelin theyll never know
I pack up all my sins in every L that I blow
I let em go, let em go, let em go, let em go</pre>
