(*Sampler from Dr. Dre's Nuthin But a G Thang*)

[Chorus: Horace Brown]
"Shake it up" Shake it up in the club
Do it girl like you're Making love
"Get Love"  hands up in the air
Wave them like you just don't care
"Spread Love"  it's the Brooklyn way
Pass the Moét and the Alizé
"Tear it up" it's what I wanna do 
When I'm loving you

[Verse One: Horace Brown]
Mmm, to my surprise, I can't believe my eyes 
You look so hot, you're making my temperature rise
Your sexy body has got me wishing 
For your loving and some French kissing 
Jeffrey Adverizét, I want to play it
But here's what I wanna do
I wanna drive you crazy, wanna drive you crazy
We'll be riding my Mercedes, ride ride 
Won't you be my lady, won't you be my lady 
Kill that attitude, kill that attitude, baby

[Chorus: Horace Brown]

[Verse Two: Horace Brown]
Youuuu'rrrre the perfect size
I love your roomy thighs 
Your lightened top, you got me hypnotized
I want to Rendezvous at the Eiffel Tower 
And I see you in about an hour 
If you make that a bet, you won't regret
Cause here's what I'm gonna Do
I wanna drive you crazy, Sugar Sugar 
We'll be riding my Mercedes, Ride Ride 
To be my lady, to be my lady 
Kill that attitude, kill that attitude, baby

[Chorus: Horace Brown] 

[Interlude #2: Horace Brown]
Gonna do, loving you, yooouuu
Yeah yeah, gonna do, I'm gonna do
I wanna drive you crazy oohh
We'll be riding my Mercedes 
To be my lady, to be Miiine 
Kill that attitude, kill that attitude, baby

[Chorus: Horace Brown w/ minor variations until faded]</pre>
