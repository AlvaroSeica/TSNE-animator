[Nate Dogg (Mister D)]
Could've been mine (Mister D, Sleepy Malo)
Could've been mine (Krypto on the track, Nate Dogg)            

Chorus: Nate Dogg
You should've been mine
You could've been mine
You wouldn't be mine
But instead, you wanna play those games
You should've been mine
You would've been mine
But now you just cryin'
Now I don't wanna take that chance (You know)
I roll through the streets with them thugs and hustlers (I roll)
Now you wanna act like you know but (You should've been mine)

[Verse 1: Mister D (Nate Dogg)]
From the day that I met you, I knew you had style
Walked right up, you replied with a smile (Smile)
Asked for your name
Numbers we exchanged
Called you up, then you started with this gauge
Strange
How I knew it wouldn't even last
Said too much about your life too fast (Fast)
Everything came with this story about cash
You said you liked it, I just laughed {*laughing*} {Mine, mine}
I ain't dumb, girl, I know you down to ride
You trying to get yours, I'm just trying to stay alive (Yep)
But that's how it goes, the strong survive (Yeah)
But back then, I wished you were mine

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 2: Sleepy Malo (Nate Dogg)]
Don't have to be, but you should've been mine
It was always the right places, never the time
City lights is where I climb to the fortune and fame
Like Frankie Valli had you close enough to carry my name
But yet far
So far to understand how I felt
About my dream to have a hit stashed under my belt
I needed help, when I looked, all I seen was myself
So it ain't surprising that it's you on the self (You style)
Call me up, just to say "Sleepy Malo, I love you"
I got radio play, so I don't really trust you
I don't really want to, but you still should've been
Next to me, while MTV showin' off my crib

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 3: Mister D {Nate Dogg}]
Now up on stage, magazines, front page
Interviews, on the news, now you calling everyday (Everyday)
You say that you love me
But didn't realize
I had motives, working on my interprise (Yeah)
Wanna see me, sayin' that you miss me
Thinking back two years ago, how could this be (Hun)
Used to diss me, now you caught the vapors (Ha ha ha)
Stuck at the bottom with the haters and the fakers (That's right)
I can't relate, I'm on the grind
You don't cross my mind, it's a waste of time
Listen to my CD, I guess it's fake
First Chicano on the song with Nate {Oh yeah}

Repeat Chorus Twice

[Nate Dogg]
Mine, mine, mine, mine</pre>
