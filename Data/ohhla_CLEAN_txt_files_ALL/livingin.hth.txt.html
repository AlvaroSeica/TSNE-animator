[Pressure]
When I came, I started like an arsonist to set a flame
Mastering this art, I'm everlasting when I pen my name
Darker like my letters stained markers on the head of Cain
Sharper than a marksman with a target in my centre frame
A father, so my red in veins harboured by my said-in name
or rather, with my other forefathers and genetic strain
If we ain't asking for respect or fame
with words as dope as marijuana, though it's hard to take what's said in vein
A splinter faction, so we're carving up against the grain
Laughing at them grasping over stardom and a sense of claim
Hard to hang your head in shame rather than accept the blame
Own your hardships, we're only master when we shed the chains
Affect the game, cause and effect, check the change
Forget your name and not the part of it from where you came
Dangerous tracks like a scar where you inject the vein
Murdering your martyrs, I'm the harbinger to end the pain

[Chorus: Lotek] + (Suffa)
Unforgiven, staying hidden like we're living in bunkers
whether you're in Sri Lanka or you live in Toronto
Dominican or Indian, we're living like hunters
whether you're in the Congo or live in Rwanda
(What we doing 'Tek?) Staying hidden like we're living in bunkers
whether you're in Sri Lanka or you live in Toronto
Dominican or Indian, we're living like hunters
whether you're in the Congo or live in Rwanda

[Suffa]
Check, I've got a cache of beats to make 'em get on the floor
Ranging from better than yours, to way better than yours
The heavy metal supporter leaving competitors floored
The most malevolent devil to ever tread on the shore
I'm a composer with a grudge ready to settle the score
and you supposedly the one to wreck like never before?
Please, you a Stooge like you're standing with Iggy
So please, bear with me like I'm standing with grizzlies
I'm a dark moon rising, bred in the 'burbs
I'm for beyond the horizon, ahead of the curve
And now your head is on swerve like you're Linda Blair and
painted eyes on my eyelids, they think I'm staring
Even when I'm sleeping, eye the angles
I sleep with demons, dine with angels
(Screaming) I'm the last one that you wanna start on
I'm sicker than lighting the next one off the last one

[Chorus]

[Black Thought]
Uh, kick it up a little notch, let the heat knock
for the number one soul brother next to Pete Rock
I'm from the gutter, came out my mother Tariq Trot'
Doctor told me I was only human like the beat box
I've been sicker than dope fiends in detox
and been around plenty time like a G-Shock
I ain't doing the kind of dimes my brother Keith got
It's Mr. Big Stuff taking Heavy D's spot
The same Rik Geezy, my man speak easy
Old soul, so ice cold, they can't unfreeze me, listen
Streets need me, so I represent my town
Two one pound, where they keep enough shots to go around
Uh, watch the crown, most underrated
None above it, you gotta love it, folks wanna hate it
In a P-A-N-A-mera Porsche four-door
Headed down town, riding round bumping Wurx' joint

[Chorus]

[Lotek]
We're staying hidden like we're living in bunkers
If you living in Tonga, or you living in Russia
Sydney city to Nigeria, they're living like hunters
whether you're in the Gaza or live in Casablanca</pre>
