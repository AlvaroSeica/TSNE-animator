[Intro: Snoop Lion]
Major Lazer! Here comes the king! JAH!!!!

[Angela Hunte]
Show no fai-th, we made it d-ay
That the warriors are comin we no pl-ay

[Chorus: Angela Hunte]
We are war with the army of haters
And when we kill 'em we just smoke them like vapors
Somebody get me my crown 'cause I'm feelin it now
It might be lord, but here comes the king
You might be a lord, but here comes the king

[Verse One: Snoop Lion]
Here I come I'm steppin in di dance, here I come I'm steppin in di dance
Posted up di wall here inna mi stance, posted up di wall here inna mi stance
We never fail we only shine with brilliance
One king one faith one religion
And if you hear me come and join the revolution
One king on faith one religion
And if you hear me come and join the revolution

[Chorus: Angela Hunte] (Snoop Lion)
We are war with the army of haters
And when we kill 'em we just smoke them like vapors
Somebody get me my crown 'cause I'm feelin it now
It might be Lord, but here comes the king (King! King!)
You might be a lord, but here comes the king (King! King! King! King! King! King! King! King!)

[Verse Two: Snoop Lion]
They gonna love me, call me Black 
All gold chrome with the diamonds in the back
Lil' homies in the front and don't know how to act
Homie, we comin deep and you'll never see us smilin
Two million strong you be rumble and we ridin
Two shots up for my afiricans, been around the world and back again
Feels so good gotta let me in, power to the people that love just to win
BOW!!!! Here comes the king!!!!

[Chorus: Angela Hunte] (Snoop Lion)
We are war with the army of haters
And when we kill 'em we just smoke them like vapors
Somebody get me my crown 'cause I'm feelin it now
It might be Lord, but here comes the king (King! King!)
You might be a lord, but here comes the king (King! King! King! King! King! King! King! King!)

[Verse Three: Snoop Lion]
And now mi in Japan and Pakistan
Ganja meks mi low and hold di land 
And royalty nuh need fah mi to grab a gram
Born a rebel then I became a man
I heard a voice he said that I would understand
One king one faith one religion
And if you love me come and join the revolution
One king one faith one religion
And if you love me come and join the revolution

[Chorus: Angela Hunte] 
We are war with the army of haters
And when we kill 'em we just smoke them like vapors
Somebody get me my crown 'cause I'm feelin it now
It might be Lord, but here comes the king
You might be a lord, but here comes the king </pre>
