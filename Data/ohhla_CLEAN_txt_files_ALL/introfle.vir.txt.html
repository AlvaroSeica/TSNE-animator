There's no walls, no controls
To make up for that they try to teach me how to act without thinking
Like a soldier who can take apart and reassemble a gun blindfolded

"Kick his ass! Fuck him up! Fuck him up!!"
"KICK HIS ASS! Kick the shit out of him Danny!"

I realized that my training was useful
After awhile, I grew to understand
that my role was less about saving lives
than about bearing witness</pre>
