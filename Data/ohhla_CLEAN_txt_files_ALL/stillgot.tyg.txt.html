[Intro/Chorus One: Drake]
I feel good, I got some time off God it's been so long
Did you have fun? Cause I'ma need a cab just to get me home
And maybe you could call in sick
And bring it to the crib and get all this {dick}
I know, I know I'm blunt, but how real is that?
You want that feelin back?

[Tyga]
Probably one of my realest loves ever, four page letters
In time it's all better cause time heal whatever
I'ma need a moment cause moments last forever
Cars with cream leather, females who aren't regular
Push the pointed metal we like it and now we careless
I'd rather stay friends with benefits 'til we ready
Not ready, Sean John got my feelin heavy
She like "One Mo' Chance, Mo' Problems, no Biggie"
Ahh~! It's all good, don't take it the wrong way
Ain't nuttin personal but who this nigga in your face?
We can leave together or we can take up space
The night young we should head over to my place
Hah, now we laughin and all that
Tell your friends they can fall back
Ain't even gotta ask twice
Just tell what you feelin like, I'm like

[Chorus One]

[Chorus Two: Drake]
Well you should know
I still got it for you, I still got it for you {*3X*}
And even though we let it go, it's better that you know
I still got it for you, I still got it for you {*3X*}
And even though we let it go, it's better that you know

[Tyga]
(I still) Uhh, ain't no ain't nobody lie
Heard you got a ballplayer but he don't excite you
Huh, I ain't the one you gotta lie to
Lay down, relax, climax, let me bite you
Ahh! Still a still a super freak
You know how I be when I'm rollin in the sheets
Enough about me I heard you finished your degree
Just call me Ginuwine cause I'm the same, ol', G
We was young, full of insecurities
Grown up now, all we got is old memories
Used to be like enemies, arguin at Barney's
Fly shit, too much pride to say sorry
Shit, problems ruin like half a day
Number twenty-fo', let it fade away
She gotta leave but she wanna stay
She like "How you feelin babe?" I'm like

[Chorus One] + [Chorus Two]

[Outro: Drake]
I still got it for you, I still got it for you {*3X*}
And even though we let it go, it's better that you know
I still got it for you, I still got it for you {*3X*}
And even though we let it go, it's better that you know
I still...</pre>
