[Holocaust]
Into a single basin, make her buy ice
And out morning the dazzling sun
His rare for, come, have, breakfast
For the short term memory of a naked woman
Hovering around in the sky, covered by birds
You see there has been an on going war, the lady of the birds
Into a single basin, make her buy ice
And out morning the dazzling sun
His rare for, come, have, breakfast
For the short term memory of a naked woman
Hovering around in the sky, covered by birds
You see there has been an on going war, the lady of the birds
Into a single basin, make her buy ice
And out morning the dazzling sun
His rare for, come, have, breakfast
For the short term memory of a naked woman
Hovering around in the sky, covered by birds
You see there has been an on going war, the lady of the birds
Into a single basin, make her buy ice
And out morning the dazzling sun
His rare for, come, have, breakfast
For the short term memory of a naked woman
Hovering around in the sky, covered by birds
You see there has been an on going war, the lady of the birds

[Outro: Peter Tevis "Lonesome Billy" sample]
The rough man, who would rather kill than run...
Always kept one hand near his gun...</pre>
