First Verse (C-Loc):

Open your mouth wide traitor put this pistol inside,
You my dogg thought I'd die for you, boss hogg was ready to ride for you,
But you fucked me, you lucky, you deserve to die,
But I got love for you and your folks so I'ma let'cha slide,
A real nigga, always been down with you, you bitch you,
Just remember from now on, clown I don't fuck with you,
Spot your ass like a spotlight, you'z a phony,
Even though this shit don't sound like clowns, you ain't my homie,
Now you standin' on the hook, bout to get your ass shook,
Crazy muthafuckin' walkin' around playin' with thugs,
Fuck that judge, and that D.A.,
I been down since the first day,
Bitch you snitched when I treated you like blood,
I guess that's love?

Chorus (Maxminelli):

What's love?
I don't know nigga you tell me
What's love?
Is it somethin' I'm supposed to see?
What's love?
When they actin' like your enemy
L to the O to the V to the E
What's love?
I don't know nigga you tell me
What's love?
Is it somethin' I'm supposed to see?
What's love?
When they actin' like your enemy
L to the O to the V to the E

Second Verse (C-Loc):

Fuck, love'll get'cha killed or make a nigga kill somethin',
Cuz of love blood gets spilled, no future in your frontin',
It's funny, how muthafuckas love ya in the beginning,
Til' you fuck'em, then they love ya just enough to kill you,
Word is bond,
All around the World, same song,
Got to get it on cuz a nigga played the game wrong,
Keep your word nigga, and I'm down wit'cha to the end,
You ain't heard nigga?  When the goons come to get'cha, I'm your friend,
Nigga thin, yakkin', gin, hard times, on the grind, ignorin',
Any shit I hear about'cha in the wind, no lyin',
Ever day love is goin' crazy,
Niggas killin' they ladies,
Ladies killin' they niggas,
Usin' triggas,
And Joe Blow cuz he fuckin' your hoe,
Never know what an in-love muthafucka is thinkin',
No joke, don't talk about when it involves some Franklins,
These crazy muthafuckas'll leave your ass stinkin'

Chorus

Third Verse (C-Loc):

You gotta watch love, it'll get'cha fucked in the game,
Nowadays niggas love they paper more than they thang,
Come on mane, shit I done picked Peter for some paper,
That loves a muthafucka it'll make a nigga rape ya,
You fuckin' with the bitch but for a minute,
She already actin' like she all up in it,
Watch the broad fall up in it,
All on you, if you choose to play the game,
But that love thang'll make your brains hang, see that?
Beware, or be square in the pine box,
Whole life, in the air because a sack of rocks off top,
Give the game to a nigga give a fuck if you use it,
All the niggas who feel me, got 'em hollerin' "Don't stop abuse it"
