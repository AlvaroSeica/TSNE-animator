[Chorus]
At the the top it's just us nigga
But I don't really trust niggaz
Otf it's just us nigga
But I don't really trust niggaz
Gbe we don't fuck with niggaz
At the top where you see us nigga
Since a youngin bitch we been them niggaz
Since a youngin bitch we been them niggaz

[Verse 1]
From a bitch I want top nigga
Fuck a opp we send shots nigga
Bullets coming none stop nigga
At the top I don't see you niggaz
And I'm steady rolling up swishers
If it's a problem we ain't get the issue
My niggaz they will deal withcha
I ain't even gotta deal witcha
Since a younging been a real nigga smoke
I blow nothing but kill nigga and
Bitch I'm in the field nigga
You might get killed nigga

[Chorus]
At the the top it's just us nigga
But I don't really trust niggaz
Otf it's just us nigga
But I don't really trust niggaz
Gbe we don't fuck with niggaz
At the top where you see us nigga
Since a youngin bitch we been them niggaz
Since a youngin bitch we been them niggaz

[Verse 2]
Since a youngin bitch we been them niggaz
A small circle with no new niggaz
Because I don't really trust niggaz
Gbe it's just us nigga
And she just wanna fuck with us
So much kush got me stuck nigga
In other words high as fuck nigga
Life's a movie I'm a priceless picture
400 for the belt nigga (Gucci belt nigga)
Right or wrong you'll get left nigga
For that bag you'll get left nigga
For my niggaz you'll get left nigga

[Chorus]
At the the top it's just us nigga
But I don't really trust niggaz
Otf it's just us nigga
But I don't really trust niggaz
Gbe we don't fuck with niggaz
At the top where you see us nigga
Since a youngin bitch we been them niggaz
Since a youngin bitch we been them niggaz</pre>
