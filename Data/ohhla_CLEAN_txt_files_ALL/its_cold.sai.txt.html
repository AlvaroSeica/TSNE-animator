[Intro]
Uhh...
"Cold, cause it's cold, cause it's cold, and I'm cold"
It's cold, it's cold, I'm cold
"Cause it's cold, cause it's cold, cause it's cold, and I'm cold"
It's cold, it's cold, uhh, I'm cold
"It's so cold in the streets" ahh yessir!
"It's so cold, anywhere that you go"
"Somebody take me to another place"
"A place where, it ain't so cold" why?
"Cause it's cold, cause it's cold, and I'm cold"
It's cold, it's cold, I'm cold
"Cause it's cold, cause it's cold, cause it's cold, and I'm cold"
It's cold, it's cold, uhh, check it

[Saigon]
My momma with my grandmomma now
I wonder what they sayin when they lookin down; wonder if I made 'em proud
I made it this far, I wonder if that made 'em smile
I took something so wild and I made a mile
But now people takin my kindness for a weakness
Talkin shit about me like I ain't one of the deepest
Like I ain't connected to them niggaz with them sweepers
that'd be happy to introduce fools to the Grim Reaper
You think you know me cause you seen me on a website?
Well did you know I'm in some drama almost e'ry night?
I never set out to be a fuckin celebrity
So I don't what people think give 'em the right to mess with me
Feeling like they testin me, gettin ready to lose control
Momma would've said use music, it soothes the soul (I know)
I try to live my life on cruise control
But I feel the need to speed right now baby bro
cause it's cold

[Chorus]
"It's so cold in the streets"
"It's so cold, anywhere that you go"
"Somebody take me to another place" where?
"A place where, it ain't so cold"
"Cause it's cold, cause it's cold, and I'm cold"
"Cause it's cold, cause it's cold, cause it's cold, and I'm cold"

[Saigon]
Check it; my momma with my grandfather now
If heaven got a ghetto they in that part of town
I wonder if it get cold up there in the clouds
Cause down here Jack Frost ain't fuckin around
Even in the summer time you can feel the windchill
Shots light up the night, niggaz gettin it in still
This is where we call home, shit is like a war zone
Try to dress warm, put your long john drawers on
Homey it's cold; and you gon' need more than some hot chocolate
Cause when it's on somebody spittin them Glock rockets
'til you seen somethin that ain't for your eye sockets
This is our hustle and no you can not knock it
{*brrrrr*} Freezin out here
You would think that it was winter season I swear
Everywhere you would turn the Feds and the D's is right there
Shit is like a freakin nightmare

[Chorus]

[Saigon - imitating GZA's "Cold World"]
They'll be runnin on the block, bustin off shots
Shit is deep on that block and you've got me locked down
in this cold, cold world

[Outro]
Remember that shit? SHIT REAL~!
It's cold out here man
Recession, ain't got no money, no job
Niggaz still shootin, goin to jail every day
It's cold... it's cold... it's cold... and I'm cold
It's cold (yeah nigga) Saigon, YEAH!</pre>
