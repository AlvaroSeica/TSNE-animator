"Time ... Time ... What is it?"

[Chorus]
"Time ..."
People wait for it others hate all of it and many waste all of it
Time. I need to know, "what is it"
And when it's yours what will you do?
"Time ..."
Don't lose track of it
Let it pass you, kid
Or you'll find out what's after it
"Time." I need to know "what is it"
Cause mine might be long overdue.

[Verse 1]
Spare a minute of your time to sit and listen to a rhyme
about decisions in your life that you choose
There's this kid, they call him Byron and he misplaces his lighter
and his bills are past due so he's screwed
No ambition left to find, he sleeps until it's five
Feeds his body mad brew and fast food
Gets back too late to say hi to dad, so one day father gets mad
And tells him what to do, he's gotta move
Now he's confused, walking down the street without any shoes
And he's starting to look more skinny too
What more can he do?
He's clueless begging quarters for food
But he's content cause that's all he's gotta do, what a fool
He should have kept better track of minutes and dollars he used
Then he could probably do whatever he wanted to
But he acts like he's trapped right where he is and he can't fight
Destined to live a bad life but do you believe that?
Cause many don't, including his dad
Who finds him in the back of a restaurant rooting through trash
He scoops him up fast and shoots him back to the pad for brunch
Prefaces his lesson with, "I'll only tell you once
What I'm gonna tell you now. Don't no one around
Give a fuck about your luck they just don't want you in their town.
Time waits for no man." Byron replied then
"That might be true but every man woman and child waits for-"

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Second story's about an attorney who's on a journey
to feed his wife and child that was born prematurely
Tis the season to worry like always
For no reason cause everything due is all paid
But can't let a song play without some interjection
Becoming restless when they're running late and had nothing for breakfast
An hour late to meet the parents the mother could no longer remain calm
But just who do you place the blame on?
The same song reloops and they never stop and listen
Feeling like each day doesn't have enough hours in it
But at any given they're dealing with million dollar digits
If that's how I was living do you think I would complain? No.
But back to the show with me
A rough day at court quickly turned to getting more tipsy than Nicole Richie
Rolling swiftly after boozing and cruising on purpose
Ended with the Sheriff asking "Do you have proof of insurance?"
The answer was yes, but then he breathed a flammable breath
And the officer saw his new passenger sweat ...
"What happens next?" Wait. Look at his license. His name is Byron
Looks like he took some advice and didn't like it
And would almost rather be back with no food on the street
Now look and see cause Byron lives in both you and me
Trusted judges among us, even brothers who lie
To survive look inside for the right balance, and you might manage</pre>
