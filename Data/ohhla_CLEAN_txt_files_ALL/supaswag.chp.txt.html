Typed by: AZ Lyrics

My Chevrolet be bangin bangin
Dubs in the trunk with the doors wide
Screens glow so bright
Chromes shinin when the 4's glide
Windows tinted so I, Blow my, Oh my
Bubblegum kush I'm so high
Slab up that is all
We shall never stag or fall
Super Sayan man so please stay off my Dragonballz
All about a stack G
24's run like track meet
You can keep King Kong in yo trunk cause I got Godzilla in the backseat
ROOF
Big dog shit, Jungle in my Closet
Red Monkeys pissed off cause the Bathing Apes keep startin shit
Runnin my city like I'm run yo block
Run up on me &amp; the gun go POP
Ran through the red light in my drop
Big money so never runnin from the cops
Put niggaz on in the hood so when I'm sleep I still get money of Klutz
Got a couple Puerto Rican hoez in the west side
Everytime I come they toss me bucks
I got niggaz everywhere so the paint job really ain't cost me much
Black on Black with the 20 inch Sways
Same car as them niggaz Starsky &amp; Hutch

[Chorus: 2X]
Supa Swag Man
Supa Swag Man
Supa Swag Man
S-Supa Swag Man
Supa Swag Man
Supa Swag Man
Supa Swag Man
Call Me Supa Swag Man

Check my fit I'm so clean ho
9 in my Phee Coat
I feel like a million bucks or should I say 25 Kilos
What you mad at me for
The whole world think we zeros
I'm showin these niggaz how to really get money
You should call me the C-Town Hero
Gettin all dis money what the fuck I need the beef for
But everyone of my niggaz be strapped
Fuck around we put you to sleep hoe
Gotta little fetish 4 Puerto Rican hoez or I'll jus go to Puerto Rico
Look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane, oh no wait that's a G4
It's obvious I'm on some other shit take a look
How can me &amp; you be on the same page if I'm in a different book
Look at my Fit
Look at my Bitch
Look at my Regal 76
Look at my dick it must be long cause when I'm gone they on my tip
Like Swag up, Slab up, Cash up, we got dough
Land Rover, Range man best believe we got 4
If I was you I'd hate me too cause yo baby mama think I'm hot tho
Maybe cause we young, black trendsetters who got dough

[Chorus: 2X]
Supa Swag Man
Supa Swag Man
Supa Swag Man
S-Supa Swag Man
Supa Swag Man
Supa Swag Man
Supa Swag Man
Call Me Supa Swag Man</pre>
