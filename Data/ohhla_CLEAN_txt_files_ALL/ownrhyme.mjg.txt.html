Unh, light up the bomb
Cuz here I come
It's eight bizall got the remedy
Dr. Green's sticky got the cure for me
Pimp tight, I'm so tight
Takin flight like a kite
When the wind blows
Creepin in my Timbo's
Most, hoe's know, I'm out to get the loot
Fuck being your boyfriend girl I wanna hit the boot's
Jump, deep in that rump, and then I got a flat bitch
You should've known how a real nigga act
That's, why I be, about my P's and Q's
Cuz hoe's end up being bad news
Find em, fuck em, split em, forget em
Let the hoe go, so the next Joe can hit em
Real about this playa shit, Suave came deeper than the ocean
Lip on hay, hit me wit the potion, floatin
Cloud nine is beneath me
Niggas can't see Eightball and MJ fuckin G
Dope, like a cake, fake, niggas get the <pow>
Fuckin wit' the, <full battlin="" force="" that="">
Don't be the next one to get done and find
You can't fade a pimp in his own fuckin rhyme

Chorus: 

Pimp, in my own, fuckin rhyme
Pimp in my own fuckin rhyme yes I'm
A pimp, in my own, fuckin rhyme
Pimp in my own fuckin rhyme yes I'm
A pimp, in my own, fuckin rhyme
Pimp in my own fuckin rhyme yes I'm
A pimp, in my own, fuckin rhyme
Pimp in my own fuckin rhyme yes I'm

These bitches be poppin game, and wearin they niggas clothes
Scandalous, groupie, big choosy, booty outrageous hoes
Bitches and backrubs
Bubblin bathtubs
Luxury hotels
Executive strip clubs
A natural born break-a-bitch scholar, holla if ya hear me
Step on if ya trick bustas fear me
Hear the, pimp speakin
For all and each 
And each and all
Now break em off somethin ball
What's next?, much real shit, comin from the two
Pimp niggas who survived, comin up payin dues
Funky flippin
Style switchin
Niggas better pay attention
Before the automatic starts spittin
Listen, Eightball be straight bubblin
Slaw ass niggas gettin broke off by my tongue again
Comin in, MJ fuckin G lettin em no the time
And I'm, just a pimp in my rhyme

Chorus:

Pimp, in my own, fuckin rhyme
Pimp in my own fuckin rhyme yes I'm
A pimp, in my own, fuckin rhyme
Pimp in my own fuckin rhyme yes I'm
A pimp, in my own, fuckin rhyme
Pimp in my own fuckin rhyme yes I'm
A pimp, in my own, fuckin rhyme
Pimp in my own fuckin rhyme yes I'm

Here comes the motherfucking playa
The rhyme saya
Bitch slaya
I break a
Young womans back then I take her
Home
The thrill is gone
I gotta jet, the set
Before I get my ass in some mess
Sippin hennesey, till I finish the whole cup of the cognac
Catchin contacts, put the blunts back
Supa fly mista goldy, 
Its getting oldy
So label me a young goody
Straight out the hoody
I'm able to lay my game down
In a single bound
Then while I'm in the same town
Smokin out on the pound
As I'm keepin an eye for tight hoe's, while I creep, through the streets
While you sleep put them D's on my Jeep, peep this
A hundred and ten percent, physical fitness
I lay the type of pipe that put the plumber out-a-business
Who is this?, manipulata
Demonstrata
Pimp shit, top rata
Trick hata
Bustas can't comprehend, but then again
They never could, to busy fuckin off in the neighborhood
I'm a keep pimpin rhymes
I'm outta my pimpin mind
I'm here to say that I'm
A pimp in my own rhyme

Chorus:

Pimp, in my own, fuckin rhyme
Pimp in my own fuckin rhyme yes I'm
A pimp, in my own, fuckin rhyme
Pimp in my own fuckin rhyme yes I'm
A pimp, in my own, fuckin rhyme
Pimp in my own fuckin rhyme yes I'm
A pimp, in my own, fuckin rhyme
Pimp in my own fuckin rhyme yes I'm
Pimp, in my own, fuckin rhyme
Pimp in my own fuckin rhyme yes I'm
A pimp, in my own, fuckin rhyme
Pimp in my own fuckin rhyme yes I'm
A pimp, in my own, fuckin rhyme
Pimp in my own fuckin rhyme yes I'm
A pimp, in my own, fuckin rhyme
Pimp in my own fuckin rhyme yes I'm
A pimp!</full></pow></pre>
