Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Strike down the ones who
Come criticize you
Strike down the ones who
Come jeopardize you
Come jeopardize you
And like a new grown seed
The man come and chop you down
He come chop you down
And when your reaching for that sunshine
He come chop you down
He come chop you down
The man come he say to me
In the morning time you'll see me by the ocean floor
Building castles
Building castles made of sand
Said if your good to me you know that ill be good to you
You never really understood the meaning of the truth</pre>
