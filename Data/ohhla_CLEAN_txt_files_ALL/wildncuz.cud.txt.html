Song:   Wild'n Cuz I'm Young
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Chorus]
I be wild'n cause I'm young, wil-wild'n cause I'm young
Wild'n cause I'm young, wil-wild'n cause I'm young
I be wild'n cause I'm young, I be wild'n cause I'm young
And I'll be wild'n, 'til I'm chillin old

[Kid Cudi]
Liquor all night, love it!
Untamed youths, the Coupes moves like bullets
I guess the fact my father smoked and drank
made it a young nigga destiny to do the exact same
Young wildin and all, me and my co-D's
Watch the phonies, and hoes that claim they blew me
Dark skin China doll with the fake tits
Ice grillin my Spanish chick, word~!
We all in together, now we off it
Cops be buggin, shotguns on the whip
Fuck 'em! I would never sweat for a piggie
You can catch me high, it's all good, no biggie

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

[Kid Cudi]
Four in the morning gettin cozy
So much Goose I let the fries soak it up some
Tuesday weekly, the legend of the Rager
Most have witnessed The Cud in the club
... and don't have Plain Pat ready
Ice is thrown and the whole crew gone
Done off for better and very celebratory
Fuck applause, I'ma tell my story
No matter the phase, my name is engraved
in the minds of the young'uns who be livin to they grave
... you live and you learn
Doin bumps in the day and keep blunts to burn

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

[Kid Cudi]
... rage! Cause I'm paid
Take the grey, and create another shade
Awesome, no mo' bitches playin possum
Pop and lock 'em, and send 'em on home
Tired of hoes, all they want is to get chose
Know the code, when a women with some toes
Optimos, takin trips to Australia
Do some blow and hope you make it through the show
Hands, high
Go wit'cha soul and try floatin through the sky
Hide the pain with some pussy and mimosas
Costa Rica, next on the agenda

[Chorus] - repeat 2X</pre>
