[Intro: Apocalipps]
Now Born... I'm ready, let's go ya'll

[Chorus 2X: Truck (Apocalipps)]
Nobody's fucking with Lipps (nobody's fucking with Lipps)
Nobody's fucking with Lipps (nobody's fucking with Lipps)

[Apocalipps]
Yes, ya'lling, ball like Spalding
Fucking with Truck, it's a blueberry morning
Let's go, the Bastardz'll leave you wet though
Hot shit, that melt the plastic on your techno
All my bitches, all my thugs, get your shit, let's go
Say Lipps, and watch these faggot niggas get petro'
It's been a good year, you know, pedrico flipping
And I been nice since Atari's and Colecovision
I got a tech with an engine and an air condition
And that's, what we create, cuz that's our mission, so
Stay alert, it's so easy to hide you
Apocalipps, my gimmick is, once you listen, I got you
You like a dalmation, it's so easy to spot you
I'm the kid, you the balloon, it's so easy to pop you
I'm about to throw a block party, and lock the whole block down
Matter fact, bring your gun, cuz it's a glock party
And I hope nobody get shot
Cuz that MC make shit hot, you know why?

[Chorus 1.5X]

[Apocalipps]
I'm so nice, niggas ask me, let me borrow your flow
Let me introduce ya'll niggas to the star of the show
A-P-O, C-A, Lipps, make 'fuck the court' songs
That make the D.A. flip, you see that shit?
Now who the first MC, to step up and get they face lit
Blow you, slow mo' style, like The Matrix
I hate this, when I, got to use violence
For my dead arm can we please have a moment of silence
Now I'mma stop spitting rhymes like these
For niggas call my P.O., and the'll tell her I'm blowing trees
Apocalipps is prophecies, read the scriptures in lines
On how I traveled through time, and battled cats for they shines
That's how I got the '88 rope chain shit, I took Kane shit
We was spitting, and he came with some lame shit
But now it's 2G, they rock the platinum and diam's
So I, iced out my watch, I fucked around and froze time
Now I'm stuck here, caught a bid for sticking up dudes
And used to travel through jail, and battle cats for they food
I battle for soups, fuck that, I battle for boots
You will be leaving barefooted, if we battle for boots
I splatter you dukes, don't get your shit pushed back
And niggas gon' start calling you mummy, cuz you a wrap
I got a six shot with a plastic beam
The way I flip, you will sware I'm on gymnastic teams
And you bastards scream, when my plastic steam
And I can turn your Gucci pants, into acid jeans, you see?</pre>
