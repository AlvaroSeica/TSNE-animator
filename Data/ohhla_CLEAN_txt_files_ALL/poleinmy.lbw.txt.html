[Intro]
It's Mr. do it for the ladies (yeah)
And it's that LB-dub gang {yeah boi}
Better get your hands out
You better get your hands out {yeah}
It's that LB-dub gang {yeah boi}
(We callin all strip clubs around the world)
I said you better get your hands out
You better get your hands out (oooh-weeee) {yeah}
 
[Chorus: Bow Wow]
I got a pole in my basement
So shorty you ain't gotta go in, shorty just come bring a friend
I got a pole in my basement
Lil' mama I got wings on deck, shorty got money to spend
Come over over, I'ma break you off
Lil' mama I know whatchu' need
Said lil' mama come over over, I'ma break you off
Lil' mama I know whatchu' need
 
[Verse 1]
If this is song, then go get busy (yeah)
Them niggaz throwin singles, shorty be throwin 50's (yeah)
Cuz I'ma make a storm, make a storm in her, in her (say what)
Big ballers, no lames in her, in her (say what)
Drop it up, up and down to the floor lil' mama (yeah)
If I throw some more cash at'cha, can you do it longer (huh)
She's a bonafide pole tool, just like the magician
Got her ass like Puffy so I gotta keep tippin (damn)
She's definitely a 10, got all the guys chase her (uh-huh)
And shorty fuck the club I got a pole in my basement (sure do)
Call me Mr. ATL because I'm always full of cash
If I run out, don't worry girl I got another stash
 
[Chorus] 
 
[Verse 2]
I'ma make it Katrina (what), these niggaz make it drizzle (what)
Gone on patron (what), gone off a skittle (what)
When I keep tossin money 'til I can't no more
I'ma keep tossin money 'til my arm gets sore (oooh-weeee)
See let's play a little game, all you really want to know
Is Carla tryna pick up every single dollar I throw
It might take a little minute, maybe even a hour
How about you and your homegirls meet me in the shower (haha)
You know it ain't trickin baby girl if you got it
Plus your face is like Beyonc√©, damn you a problem (yeah)
Now we can do this all night girl e'ryday (say what)
Now how you do that, I mean this the replay, now bust it open shorty
 
[Chorus] 
 
[Verse 3]
Sayin you ain't gotta worry tonight, lil' mama come over, come over
And if you got friends bring them with you, I'm waitin for ya to come over, come over
Girl I got money to throw, you already know, come over, so come over
Whatever you make in the club, I got it in my crib, come over, so come over
They call me Big Bang Bow, and I can make it rain all night
And if that LB-dub gang's in the club, then we gon' make it rain all night
 
[Chorus]
 
[Outro]
Said if your boy Bow Weezy's in the club {yeah boi}
Then I'ma make it rain all night {yeah}
If my nigga T-Waters in this bitch and Hyde's in this bitch {yeah boi}
They make it rain all night {yeah} 
If I got my nigga Shiz with me, my nigga Bart with me {yeah boi}
Make it rain all night {yeah}
It's that LB-dub gang {yeah boi}
Hmm, huh... {yeah}</pre>
