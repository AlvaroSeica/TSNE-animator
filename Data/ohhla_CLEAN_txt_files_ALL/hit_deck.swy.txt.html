Let loose on 'em, yea, let loose on 'em
Hit the Deck. Crooked I and King Tech

(Crooked I)
I spit impossible rhymes, full of philosophical lines
My phenomenal shine, is leaving everyone of your opticals blind
Run you over when it's Apocalypse time
Half nigga, half fesal like Optimus Prime
Cockin' this nine to pop ya
Permanent disfigurement
Have you rocking half a mask like the phantom of the opera
My three is how fast I drop ya
Walk fast, that bothers the speed they clock to
Hatchet, acid, delivery chopped ya
You thought you had a win here
Like watching porno flicks with six chicks
I'm the hardest nigga in here
Straps under you here, we blast like every night's new year
Seribal hemispheres get blue here
No need to cuss and fuss, just
Hop out of the bushes scratched up from the brush ya bust
I make the angriest athiest praise me, if not
He's feeling the simultaneous pain of a shot
And the shank in his pancreas, maybe it's my instantenous clots
The craziest nigga couldn't face me if an alien gave him his thoughts
Us kamikazees regulate
I strap a bomb under my trench coach
And hug you 'till it detonates
I was brainwashed by NWA and BDP
I'm the year two-thousand versin of the D.O.C
When Crooked I spot these fake clicks
They better be able to dodge bullets like the Matrix, I take six
I'm so ominent, it's in dominant, improminent, hip-hop conglomerate
On this continent I'm BOMBING IT</pre>
