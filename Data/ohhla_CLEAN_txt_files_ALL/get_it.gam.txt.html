[Childish Gambino]
Childish Gambino, doper than 20 kilos
Feeling me no Aveeno, pardon me that's my ego
Nigga I'm on, my swagger on He-Man
Down for +Community+ these other niggaz +Glee+ fans
You cannot see me you are blind like Venetians
Eyes wide open, nigga stay focused
+Bat-Man+ on these niggaz, I am tired of these +Jokers+
and my brain is too expressive and your mind is on the local
Motherfucker I ain't playin; ironic I am Childish
Ad-dressin all you niggaz, now you motherfuckers stylish
And get me any indie song, I promise to annihil' it
My mouth will kill everyone, I guess that bitch a nihilist
Yeah my girls are the wildest, they're in love with a weirdo
I am so different I am protege, my hero
Self-made phenom, green like tree frogs
Save every +Penny+ like Inspector Gadget reruns
My name is Donald Glover, talented motherfucker
Childish is my cover, to hide this shit from my mother
She can't know how I'm livin, I'm drinkin and fuckin women
And she is Jehovah Witness, and don't believe in all this shit
But I gotta handle business, kick it like soccer
Upper-class Kit-Kat, break 'em off proper
I AM JUST A RAPPER, +Sick Boy+ is my clique man
You are not a +Sick Boy+, you are just a sick man
Take some Dimetapp, yeah these hoes a dime-a-tap
'less you get caught by them bitches better keep your penis wrapped
Then you are JUST A RAPPER, the sky is the limit
Don't put nothin on the game, just put somethin back in it</pre>
