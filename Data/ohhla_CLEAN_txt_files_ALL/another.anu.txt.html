[Anubis5]
I am the awesomest guy in the world
I rock aviators and I got the most beautiful girl
I play Sega Genesis daily
I'd play video games professionally if I could find someone to pay me
I like Bohemian, it's my favorite beer
My hip hop playlist consists of Epic and Ill Seer
Good folk no joke, I've met them both
Rocked stages in different places with random folk
I'm a Canadian with a heavy appetite
I like Marineland and a bonfire at night
Fubar practically raised me
So I just f'n giver until the last day of my pay week
Canada's ill, Kenny and Spenny live here
I trot from Niagara Falls to Vancouver's piers
We have no wars and our rap scene rules
But don't judge me if I say Dallas Green is cool

[Hook]
[Anubis5]
I've gotten drunk with Jim Lahey and Randy
I've been to Edmonton but I've never been to Calgary
Doug Gilmour was interstellar
He took out his false teeth for me in Zellers

[Cancer]
Bought tickets to a K-Os concert but that motherfucker cancelled on me
In the Galleria London I saw that hot bitch from YTV
I remember watching Much Music, seeing Nam's nipples poke out
Fuck with us and I'll kick your ass like my name was Sam Stout

[Cancer]
Born into poverty, not much to do but drink, fuck, fight and steal cars
Blaze a blunt and reminisce, a true survivalist with real battle scars
That was an age long ago in a galaxy far, far away
Without the hard times I wouldn't be the MC you see today
Never been to Van City but I'm still a Canuck
Maybe someday I'll be famous enough to do a show with Buck
My favorite TV show would have to be Mantracker
Dropping the most lethal bomb that will explode like a nuclear reactor
Fine finesse flow like the well dressed girls in Montreal 
Some of the hottest females I've ever seen were at the mall
Real Canadian like the super store funky fresh
Our Motley Crue of artists just seem to mesh
Galvatron Omega is the name we guarantee you will never forget
Just try me, I got the luck of the Irish son, I never lose a bet
Just turned on the London news and seen that they finally caught Snare
A world renown tag writer, I swear his shit was everywhere
