[RIDER BONE of CENTER PARK]
With my back against the wall me and a Crab was face to face
They got me stuck between a rock and a hard place
I got a strap but the Crabs came too fast
I never had a chance to make it to the fuckin' stash
So it looks in this game that Rider Bone is fucked
He aimed the strap, then he followed with the buck-buck
I hit the ground with two holes in my clothes
I'm gettin' cold - because my insides are exposed
I'm damn sleepy but I see my homies comin'
One homie pick me up, the other had the car runnin'
Now it's all up the time, will Rider Bone survive?
Or will he go - to the big dog house in the sky?
(Newsflash) - he's back, and mad
Rollin through Crab hood with a .9 wearin' a shit bag
Shootin' Crabs, Blood, I seek revenge
Goin' straight to their house and kick the do' off the hinge and as I dump
The whole family starts to holler
I'm killin' moms, pops, pets and toddlers
Rider Bone's a menace, the Crabs thought I was finished
But never will I die until the Crabs are diminished
So I peep doin' hits on the solo
I be C-K to the Bone just can't no more
And if you dump on the Bone you better smoke me
Or I'll be back to smoke you and your family

[RIDER BONE of CENTER PARK]
Yeah
And that's how was done in the 95
Done retaliated all the time
Always have, always will
Ain't no Crabs getting away with nuthin'
(...)
Killin' all Crabs, feelin' all glory
And if you can't understand, listen to the next story
And it goes a lil' some' like this here, yeah

[RIDER BONE of CENTER PARK]
Now as I make front page
Rider Bone runs in rage with a 12-gauge
E-Rickets is sure, wound's too deep for a band-aid
And doin' dirt in the 'Wood is a must
Anybody wearin' blue it's mandatory that I bust
Caps after caps until I drop
In broadlight Rider Bone still pops
It's just the life of a Blood, it's kinda risky
I hope I don't re-live the day the Crabs got me
So strapped I be when I'm rollin' thru the streets of Inglewood
The Crabs want my life for what I done to their neighborhoods
I give a fuck, Blood, it's Center Park gang
Rider Bone's insane, fuckin' Crabs in their game
Ain't no thang when it comes to C-K
It's O.K. everyday
But don't caught or you get all day
You know we lose more soldiers than weight
Homies never comin' home for a sloppy-ass C-K
I tell you this, not to fright but enlighten to you
So be smart when you're dumpin' on Crab fools
Watch your back, dump your strap to the last shell
And smash out like a bat out of hell
Center's up - we doin' more dumpin' than a dump truck
Too many young homies just don't give a fuck
And when you see the homies comin' then it's too late
Duck and dodge 'cause we're out to retaliate

"Hey Cuz I'ma kill that nigga Rider Bone
That's on my dead homies"

[RIDER BONE of CENTER PARK]
I hear the contract's out for Rider Bone, so bring it on in Centers
Cause C-K Rider Bone ain't runnin' from nann nigga
Inglewood - the motherfuckin' streets that I run
West/Side Center Park, a hundred and eleventh
B's up, pinky down, that's the Center Park sign
So if you tryin' to be a Ricket you better keep that in mind
Because I give up that Centers in a minute
And I'm dumpin' on fools - believe I'm in it to win it
Rickets catch the blues when I'm on bang status
I'm rollin' thru their hood and Rider Bone is mad as
The red bull chargin' at a red cloth
Only it's the Rider Bone chargin' at the C-locs
To put the smash down nigga, Mac-10 in effect
Ricket niggaz hit the dirt 'cause there's a lack of respect
When the blue rag meets the red rag
The blue rag's in the body bag, and it's too bad
We're bound to clash
West/Side Center Park and Crabs
So in the Inglewood streets - ain't no Crabs allowed
So when you meet that big sign sayin' welcome to the 'Wood
Bust a U if you claimin' a Crab hood
I watched that Mac-10 spray
West/Side Bloods is out to retaliate

"This is Inglewood, and we straight rat pack ya"</pre>
