(Ke'Noe Talking)
Man play that fucking beat
What's happening playboy
I'm up here thugging with my niggas
Tuff Guys, Tru Records, No Limit You heard me

(Ke'Noe)
Man most of these nigga ain't nothing but hoes
I'm an weed smoker, pistol tooter, blowing on an optimo
Tru records, Deadly Sounds, gang affilitated real niggas
Uptown that's my hood country speaking ill niggas
Man who in the fuck said the south ain't hard
Man bring them niggaas to Lousiana and watch me pull they cards
Oh my god, ya'll don't fuck around and jump into this mix
Hating on Ke'Noe and Mr. Marcelo get you hit bitch
I'm an rugging nigga screaming Tru till I die ho
Say Doe run the hoook and I'm off to the liquor store

[Chorus 2X]
Y'all niggas can't fuck with us
It's No Limit and Tuff Guys from Tuff
Y'all niggas better get the fuck

(Mr.Marcelo)
I'm gonna let you know off top brah
Never leave home with my glock brah
Stay strap with the chopper
Prepare to bring heat to the coppers
Ya'll niggas can't stop us

Finger on the trigger on the lever nigga

Low down dirty deep from the ghetto
Keep shit mello, Keep shit mello
