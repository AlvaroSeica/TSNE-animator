Song:   Nobody Knows
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
Nobody knows what I go through
Wish you could put yourself inside my shoes
You got friends that ain't friends no more
They don't understand the life I chose
See the money and the fame
It can hurt everything you love
Got some people that depend on me
And I can't give up
They don't know what I'm going through
They don't know what I'm going through

[Verse 1]
Nobody saw the struggle they just see the reward
They focused on the peace but they never saw the war
Homies I started with ain't make it till the end
They used to be my niggas now we ain't friends
Long as I'm putting niggas on it be all good
Soon as I tell them that I can't they're the first to go
I see 'em trying to come around since I'm out the hood
But I see 'em being fake so I let 'em know
I got to let 'em know

[Chorus]
Nobody knows what I go through
Wish you could put yourself inside my shoes
You got friends that ain't friends no more
They don't understand the life I chose
See the money and the fame
It can hurt everything you love
Got some people that depend on me
And I can't give up
They don't know what I'm going through
They don't know what I'm going through

[Verse 2]
Now everybody run up with their hand out
Maybe 'cause I stand out
See me in a video, thinking that I'm cashing out
They don't see my homies with the notices on their house
They just think I'm eating so they sitting with an open mouth
Laying back saying I should give 'em this and buy 'em that
I remember back when I was hurting, working selling crack
Where were all these niggas at claiming they my fam
If I lost it all tomorrow I know they won't give a damn

[Chorus]
Nobody knows what I go through
Wish you could put yourself inside my shoes
You got friends that ain't friends no more
They don't understand the life I chose
See the money and the fame
It can hurt everything you love
Got some people that depend on me
And I can't give up
They don't know what I'm going through
They don't know what I'm going through

(ah, ah) Nobody knows [5x]
Nobody knows mmm nobody knows</pre>
