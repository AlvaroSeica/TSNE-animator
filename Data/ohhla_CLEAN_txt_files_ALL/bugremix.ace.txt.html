[Chorus: Future] + (DJ Khaled)
I come looking for you with Haitians
I stay smoking on good Jamaican (this We The Best Music)
I fuck bitches from different races
You get money they started hating - TURN UP~!
I woke up in a new Bugatti~! (REMIX~!) {*4X*}
I woke up in a new Bugatti~!

[Ace Hood] + (DJ Khaled) + (*Future)
Yeah; I woke up in a new Bugatti, tats all over my body
Gettin' real money, niggas still hatin' on me, man y'all need a new hobby
Or they won't talk to me, what they gon' say? I ball, you a waterboy, Bobby Boucher
On top, toup√©e, y'all niggas fruitcakes, I don't really play games but I keep 2 K's
Damn, Mr. Hood why you do 'em like that? Pull up in the drop with the ceiling top back
Couple weeks old, "Bugatti" done went gold, you ain't even know, I deserve that plaque
We The Best, runnin' every summer in fact, July 16th I'm bringin' the real back
Broward! Pussy (This the remix!) (*I woke up in a new Bugatti~!)

[Meek Mill]
Hold up, double M back in this bitch, walk in the club with a MAC on my hip
Diamonds look like niggas be snappin a flick, ballin' I blow fifty racks in the VIP
I back in the whip, Maybach with your bitch, a new Mussolini in back of the six
I'm shittin' on rappers, these rappers is sick cause my homies got whips that these rappers ain't get
Cause we crackin' them bricks and I package the zip, and I'm switchin' my flow, I spit crack in this bitch
And I been hit your ho, now she back on my dick, but I get to the dough and get back at your bitch
Like hol' up, I woke up in Coon new Ferrari with all my motherfuckin' jewelry on me
New Aston Martin plus a Rolls Royce and a new Ferrari, that's a new Bugatti, nigga

[Chorus: Future] + (DJ Khaled)
TURN UP~! - I woke up in a new Bugatti~! (REMIX~!)
I woke up in a new Bugatti~! (REMIX~!) {*3X*}
I woke up in a new Bugatti~!

[T.I.]
Okay... Bankhead, nigga
HUSTLE GANG, PARTNA~!
THIS THE KING, BITCH~!
Let's get it...

And it's paid for nigga, got racks, stack 'em up like Lego nigga
I'm a motherfuckin' G, I don't play with no nigga, multi-millionaire self-made ho nigga
H-U-S-T-L-E gang - for that, in God we trust, we bang
I'm the new John Gotti in a new Bugatti, I got a few young hotties wanna get shit poppin'
Right, put it in the light, nigga got ice but it don't look right
If a nigga buy a brick and it don't cook right, I'll whip that shit for a rack, sit tight
I got a bag full of tools and some yay to move, and all I want is money, leave the fame to you
I graduated out of gladiator school, so all I know is go like I'm trained to do
Right now, turn my Mazy pedal to the metal I'm ashin' out
I let the top down in my Phantom drop, blowin', I'm high as an astronaut
When you see me, I'm cashin' out, walked into Mercedes bought half the lot
You keep carrying on, you getting carried out cause I don't take ass whoopins, just pass 'em out
Is this worth getting blasted about? No forreal, is it worth getting blasted about?

[Wiz Khalifa]
{*laughing*} Uh!
Money conversation; get so high, I be scrapin'
Got my eyes like a Asian, in my ride, like I'm racin'
In the sky, like a plane; it's Gang or die
Ain't no lames up in my circle, ain't no ho shit in my eyes
Throwin' money in the air, poppin' bands and let it fly
Where I'm from, you come up short, pull that thing and let it fly
You know me; blow so much dank, think I'm Marley, got so much ink on my body
Brought so much drink to the party, I fell asleep and woke up in a new BUGATTI~!

[Chorus: Future] + (DJ Khaled)
TURN UP~! - I woke up in a new Bugatti~! (REMIX~!)
I woke up in a new Bugatti~! (REMIX~!)
I woke up in a new Bugatti~!

[Birdman] + (DJ Khaled) + (*Future)
Yeah... Rich Gang
Fresh, whips, candy on that money dip
Five hundred, I'm hood rich, put in work, did a hundred flips
Been about them mansions, Stunna island, we packin'
Rich Gang, we uptown, nigga hardbody and mackin'
Tool on that back, nigga - money and that power
Mansion on that beach, nigga - blood red Bugatti
Versace on my bitch, nigga - blow a mil' like it's a dollar
Stunna (This the remix!) (*I woke up in a new Bugatti~!)

[French Montana] + (DJ Khaled) + (*Future)
Ay, ay, ay, ay, woke up with the crown nigga, servin' Bobby Brown nigga
Started from the bottom now it's "Carter", Nino Brown nigga
Take my spot nigga never will, now I know how 'melo feel
We both shooters from New York, but I shown nigga how the metal feel
Fidel Castro with them cuban links
With Mark Cuban where them Cubans link
+Excuse My French+ nigga, no France, hottest new niggas in ten years
Coke Boy deal like ten M's, DJ Khaled up in there
(This the remix!) (*I woke up in a new Bugatti~!)

[2 Chainz] + (*DJ Khaled) + {Future}
Flow hot as the Mojave, gimme that sloppy shit
All on my car stick, give her some hundreds she did
Like this, I'm a say this (I'm a say this), fuck it, I'll say it (fuck it, I'll say it)
If you got good pussy you should always have your rent paid (tell 'em)
Choke on some bands if I'm not mistaken (mistaken)
Add up my outfit, fashion statement (fashion statement)
This the school of hard knocks, graduation (Tru)
(*This the remix!) {I woke up in a new Bugatti~!}

[Ace Hood] + (DJ Khaled) + (*Future)
Ugh; I'm sick of y'all niggas all talkin' crazy, hottest nigga spittin' and they can't debate it
I didn't really know 2Pac or B.I.G, but know the beast within'll reincarnate 'em
Fuck underrated, I'm constipated, I'm shittin' on 'em, fuck toilet paper
You're now tuned into the fuckin' greatest: Ace Hood, congratulations
Say name one nigga that's rockin' with him, flow like a hundred round choppa nigga
Made a way out of the jungle, and now they in trouble, I used to be humble as shit
Recently flooded my neck and my wrist, tell all them critics to suck on the dick
Nigga... Broward (REMIX~!) (*I woke up in a new Bugatti~!) {*echoes*}</pre>
