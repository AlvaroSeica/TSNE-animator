[Intro: Inspectah Deck]
Yeah ya big hommie, The O to the G
INS the rebel, Back at it
I've been doin this a long time man
I'm built for it, You know
I got the scars to proof it, It's real

[Chorus 2X: Inspectah Deck]
East side, West side, Everybody's side
Get money, Get high, Everybody fly
I'm livin, You livin, Aint nobody die
Big time, Small time, Everybody ride

[Inspectah Deck]
I comes from the pissiest stair case
Where shortys sling base and the creeps keep a mask on they face
And hard body, They aint just a word it's the life
And as you speak another nigga gets murdered tonight
They got cameras on the roof tops watchin my oops
In the kitchen with the blue tops dodgin the cops
In the process, Sipped a few burs, Lit a few herbs
Daily warfare, It's over just a few words
While I toss heavy weight on the beam, Cross state with the team
Caught a case for a taste of the C.R.E.A.M
And lost weight just from chasin a dream, Just from chasin the fiends
I'm only peace when I'm blazin the green
Hood life what we reppin with the weapons in hand
Squeeze off in a second for a section of land
Since thirteen measurin grams, Gerttin cheddar in grands
Don't let the tech stretch him and his fam, Man

[Chorus]

[Fes Taylor]
Smack open up doors for me, I come through with the hammer out
Listen you don't want to go to war with me
I'm Fes Taylor you heard of me
Cause my buzz spread around the world now from S.I. to Germany
Life got me stressed out, Took my Moms to surgery
Before I see my Earth go, Rather see em murder me
Shit on you purposely, My new name for you niggas is toilet seat
I'm tryna make it so we all can eat
I play the guitar, Bullet it can split the tar
Only way I make a nigga dance is shot at his feet
Rather make songs from the hood, I'm a street nigga
Got crack on the block from Park Hill to Osgood
It's all good, Hoes Woody Woodpecker, More wood
Extortin you rappers, Yall niggas should call me Suge
Two 4 the new death row, My left blow
Plus my right hook'll knock him right off his toe
Let's roll

[Chorus]
