[Verse 1: Red Cafe]
Yeah, straight up, I be paid up
Get white girl powdery like makeup
Or I Arm &amp; Hammer cut it up no razor
You order, I deliver like labor

So I got a lotta sons, the Phoenix team, uh!

Shorty get it from her mama, Call me daddy 

[Verse  3: Fabolous] (DJ Envy)
So I chirped the baby (FABOLOUS!!!)
Come through in that two tone purple maybe
Around, 7-Eleven fo a slurpee maybe

Champagne's cold in the purple haybee
