[Intro: Remedy (Clocka) {Sweetleaf}]
The warning y'all, this is a warning yo
(Listen up, the code red)
Code red (Yea yea yea)
This is the code code red
(What?) Yo yo you've been warned
(Uh-huh) {This is a warning}
This a warning yo {Warning}
(War nigga) Code red

[Remedy]
Yo yo, I came to warn you, strike and swarm you
Inform you, knowledge born you
They're on you, cameras in corners
Men who take orders, closed quarters of slaughters
Tell ya sons and daughters
Behind the closed doors it's an old wise man
With the power of destruction at the palm of his hand
Understand, how it got there is this
Not a mark in his list, white face, data risk
Son he couldn't miss, his chance to pull the strings at his dance
Control the whole world through the power of trance
How you see it?

[Clocka]
From the outer circle runnin, I'm an inner circle gunner
Clocka, holdin my block down, dope beat, polite sound
Dump, you heard it through the track in the speed bump
You need somethin to rush off, here take this poem
Inject it in ya vein, real strong
Don't dumb out, there's more than three ways for you to come out
There's mental state, check the medallion plate
Myself know what time it is, release, I got somethin to give
Are you driven? Are you strickened? Yo it's sickenin
I hear it too much, control the Dutch, clutch my hand in a ball
All I need to know is when it's time to brawl
Before you walk you gotta crawl 'fore you stand too tall
Feel ya own height, seen you stagger through the scene on nights
Don't understand ya kind, this just a warning, a warning

[Chorus: Remedy (Sweetleaf)]
Yo this a warning, I look and see a new day dawnin (Warning)
This a warning to every man born and sworn in (This is a warning)
The Remedy, I look and see a new day dawnin (Warning)

[Remedy (Sweetleaf)]
Watch this catch like a wildfire, burn in the blaze
Release those of you, most of you were caught in the maze
We got six million ways to shine like sun's rays
So do what we do to get through the last days (the last days)

[Clocka (Sweetleaf)]
Try to listen to the science of life
Anythin but that mean you don't give a fuck about your's
Until ya door's kicked in by Mac-eleven machine men
Army green men but not the ones that's toys boy
That's for sure, if not in case you've been warned
I roll with a Clan that swear they raise they right hand
And smash ya with they left, appear an injustice, it's right there
Get sent back to the essence, kid you wildin like an adolescense
In c-seventy culture, get hung like a wanted poster
Trust me, and Rem-D, ain't the ones to contest G (This is a warning)
You totally desobeyed the first one, break you and fire at you, I know it
hurt done

[Remedy (Clocka)]
Follow instructions, the black gun pulls like suction
Evil minds plot destruction, corruption
+Az the World Turnz+, born into a system of third degree burns
With no knowledge there's no wisdom, we all fall victim
Sign of the times, society's lost, controlled, read between the lines
(Warning)
Yo it's late night, come up in ya bank
Computer flippin, microchippin
Insert the disk in, see who's worth a million
They come for the killin, we know where you livin
Come kick ya shit in
Comes the door and three or four men pour in
Yo you upstairs snorin, we in the safe, panel floorin
Come and go like we tourin, bottomline is we scorin
Half way across the country by the mornin
The Remedy with the Clocka quest
Through ya treasure chest, comin up in anybody's rest
Yo peace and God bless, warning yo
This is a warning yo, this is a warning yo, this is a warning..

[Chorus 2X]

[Remedy]
Code red warning, yo, code red, code red

[Solomon Childs]
I'm all in it for the beef, save the barkin for the real dogs

[Remedy (Sweetleaf)]
Born and sworn in, this is a warning, yo..
This is a warning.. (Warning)
Uh-huh, you've been warned
Come to warning (This is a warning)

[Solomon Childs]
Lyrics spit like shots to ya police
Killa Bamz, the best thing since yeast
Don't have the gold why you cats is brass?
Solo kids you talk to fast, I peal with math
WTC, world war predicate law, hundred percent raw
Rock the universal crown, all Wu-Wear down
Nobody jokin, lyrics leave ya camp backbones broken
Broken..

[Sweetleaf]
This is a warning {5X}
Remedy, the Remedy
This is a warning..</pre>
