[Intro: Buddha Monk]
Ladies and gentlemen...
You just tuned into the station, Kickass
My name is Row Daddy Row
And tonight on our show, we got a very special guest
He goes by the name of Buddy Buddy
So sit back, relax and enjoy our station
Kickass, KTU

[Chorus 2X: Buddha Monk]
My buddy, my buddy and me
Everybody know it's my buddy and me

[Yung Budd]
Once again I'm in the studio, rhyming again
You never thought you'd hear this kid shining again
Rhyming since ten, never gonna stop with the pen
Until my mom's begetted out, with a pocket of Yen
That's when I know that I achieved every goal in my life
Like I said, I'm sixteen, but I'm filled with life
Chill with ice, faggots wanna chill, my spite
It really doesn't matter cuz I know I'm real on the mic
I'm the first on the block, with a Prada suit
My shorties stay with the latest pair of Prada boots
I never got nicknames cuz the game is real
The nine never get dirty cuz it's stainless steel
Bang with steel, you short with my grains, it peals
I send niggaz to ya crib to re-arrange ya grill

[Chorus 2X]

[Yung Budd]
You ain't a thug, nigga, you pop a gangsta bills
Let me know how it is when ya gangstas kill
Cuz I'ma throw a free party with my fam at ya crib
Don't let ya mans jump off, I'ma empty his rib
Bammer boys, but I claim, 'bout to change the game
Not Crip, not Blood, but I does my thing
And I know y'all niggaz waiting for that cypher dip
Cuz my nigga P8 just wrapped the ship
And the beef wanna die, I know that thing for a fact
But it can't cuz these faggots wanna squeeze on the Mac
Have problems with Crip, problems fam and Blood
But the beef is dead now with Buddy Love

[Chorus 2X]

[Yung Budd]
I know niggaz wanna see me with a hole in the neck
That's why I rock the bulletproof, with a hole in the chest
You see niggaz in the dirt cuz they was after the kid
They tried to hit Budd up, so I was jacking the kids
Cats wanna stay raw so I treat 'em like hoes
Ya short with my chips, I'ma heat up they toes
Eat at my foes, niggaz felt the heat when I rose
That's why the cat stay hot, you'se about to be luke warm
I sick the heat on ya sleeve, make you a new arm
I pack new arms, niggaz hate on my flow
'Dro, dough, hoes, man, you know how we flow
Take cash, never Duck-Lo, bust at folk

[Chorus 4X]</pre>
