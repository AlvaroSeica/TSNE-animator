[Verse One- Chess-T-BunZ]
Me and my girls were looking for the party
Sippin on Shirls, Cherry 7, no Bacardi
There's that new club in town (the Ass Palace)
Word, and they patted us down
Looked around crazy lights flash fog on the ground
The place was weird and it gets weirder still for real
On the Ceil, I couldnt tell but
Floatin there, a girl in some fake ass Gucci underwear
Naked, gold skin bare
Aint no joke (Did you toke?)
Nah I didnt smoke, she spoke, told us to take our pants off
I'm like Nope! Everyone was trance dancin with their hands up
I still had my pants up But then she go.

[Verse Two - Princess Superstar]
Sweep your feet with the beat unique get what you really need
Follow the beat faster than Superman speed
Rock the beat shakin the butt on the cuts
Beat it Billy Jean beat on the butt
Simon says "Get the fuck up!"
My Pharoah Monchi chi
How you soft and cuddly
Pourin all them big boobed bitches bubbly
Shake funnily
Nuff bitch for two chew chew bless you twin boo how they call me?
Peppermint Doubly

[Chorus - Slick Muffins]
Everybody get up
Take your pants off
Everybody get up
Bump your ass off
Bump bump your ass off

[Verse Three - Princess Superstar] (Chess-T-Bunz)
Check the panoply, a bubbly butt in the back of me
Cacophony of butt smacks 'n happy cackiling
Ass grappeling All happening while I'm didact-a-ing
Keep practicing (What she sayin?)
Stop thinkin, just dig in
Chess-T-shake your Big-uns
It's just the beginnin remove linens all the womens
Grab your men 'ns freak like Richard Simmons
No time to be timids Don't limit your image
Get lucky bump at home at your cribbage
C'mon get a move on
Get your groove on
This aint the right song
To leave no pants on
Hit em with a hee haw on the beat
Year God
Damn, nice to meet ya!

[Repeat Chorus - Slick Muffins]

[Verse Four - Princess Superstar]
Alright, it's time to learn a new dance now
Get yourself a partner
ow I want one partner to turn away the opposite direction
Partner #1 grab one of partner number 2's buttcheeks with one hand
Now cross over the other hand and grab the other buttcheek
And now move it in time with the trumpet
Candy cone lick it til it's gone
Kick it take it home smack it Kit Kat
Hang the phone hit that drive it home
When I say it's on then it's on
When I take it home then you best be on, dance c'mon
Body shakin you achin want you all to get naked
While I'm makin and takin your body
Breakin your body wit naughty keepin the party hearty
Hey Smartie roll up your sweet ass and party
Aint nothin wrong House music ALL NIGHT LONG
Go Chess-T Go Chess-T Go Chess-T!
Take a look at who you dancin with
Tell em who you gonna do it with
Tell em I'm gonna do ya!

[Verse Five- Brock]
When Brock's in the club
Getting lots of the love
From the sluts with the butts that be stuck on the drugs
I see you on the dance floor looking all stuck
Now you awestruck cuz Brock got pull like a fuckin small truck
Meet me at the bar so we can have a few drinks
Just see how you think and why you actin all stink
Then hit the dance floor after we buy out the bar
Feel the beat of the rhythm of the night like El Debarge
Your hips is nice and your tits is all soft
But girl I wanna see you with your pants off

[Outro - Princess Superstar]
Go Chess-T!
Poke me mon, all this booty - you gotta catch it all!!</pre>
