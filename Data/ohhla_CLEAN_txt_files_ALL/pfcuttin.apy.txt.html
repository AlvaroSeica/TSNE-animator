Apathy...Atlantic Records
That's what works, baby
You ready to do it? Let's go

Yeah, yeah yo...
I'm old school, like analog opposed to Pro Tools
And blow through your whole crew like Triple-X when he hold tools
The intellect is so cool, I freeze the cerebellum
When I'm blowin' air up in your melon
I'm compared to a felon with an infallible flow
Imagine me rappin' like I wanna hurt you
Worms will tunnel holes through your body then push that dirt through
I'm Jesus with telekinesis, I'm Moses, so focus
I open up the oceans with basic human emotions
I ain't boastin', I'm that bastard that bathes in battery acid
You makin' Apathy mad, and you taken out in a bag
Zip from your cranium to your ankles
I study the radius and the angles
To turn those who oppose into angels with halos
Guitars and harps, my bars are so sharp
Marine biologists study me instead of jaws of sharks
It's too deep, a few sleep like we goin' to nuclear war
Put my CD on sale and see what it do to your store

We show you how to do this, muthafuckas!!</pre>
