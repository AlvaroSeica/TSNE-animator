[Saul Williams]
Om nia American born of beats and blood
The concert of the sun unplugged 
I'm the, Om nia merican born of beats and blood
The concert of the sun unplugged
I'm the, Om nia merican born of beats and blood
The concert of the sun unplugged 
I'm the, Om nia merican born of beats and blood
The concert of the sun unplugged
O say can you - 20,000 negro leagues beneath
The sea foamed clouds laced with ink that stains
When rains makes books of trees at once
Upon a dawn's early light, pawn, bishop, knight
Children of night, may queens take kings
Hereafter, thereafter the trickling sands
Demand that our decisions be timely 
I'm the, om nia merican born of beats and blood
the concert of the sun unplugged
I'm the, om nia merican born of beats and blood
the concert of the sun unplugged
I'm the, offspring of spring reborn, pledged, and
sworn - the risen ash of a flag burned and torn
I'm the, blood of the womb, the risen
Tide of the moon, the dark side that the
Light cannot hide, I'm the, pages of history
Read between the lines, the living proof
Behind your symbols and sign, I'm the, son
Of a minister, love of a teacher, my mother
Taught me well so I rebel, I'm the, bell re-told
Yet a story untold, the hidden force behind
A rock that was rolled
I'm the, om nia merican born of beats and blood, the concert
Of the sun, unplugged, I'm the, om nia
merican born of beats and blood the concert
Of the sun unplugged
O say can you - 20,000 negro leagues beneath
The sea foamed clouds laced with ink that stains
When rains makes books of trees at once
Upon a dawn's early light, pawn, bishop, knight
Children of night, may queens take kings
Hereafter, thereafter the trickling sands
Demand that our decisions be timely
I'm the, om nia merican born of beats and blood
the concert of the sun unplugged 
I'm the, om nia merican born of beats and blood
the concert of the sun unplugged
I'm the, om nia merican born of beats and blood
the concert of the sun unplugged, I'm the
I'm the, om nia merican born of beats and blood
the concert of the sun unplugged
(Uh!) Lift every voice and sing (Repeat 2x)
Uh! And you don't stop! Uh! Uh!
Uh! I'm the om nia merican born of beats and blood
the concert of the sun unplugged
I'm the, om nia merican born of beats and blood
the concert of the sun unplugged  
Uh! Yeah, yeah..</pre>
