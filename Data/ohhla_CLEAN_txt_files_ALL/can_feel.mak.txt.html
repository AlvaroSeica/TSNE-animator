Song:   Can You Feel Me
Typed by: Cno Evil

[Intro: Makeba Mooncycle]
Yeah, this song is dedicated to an imaginary male
This is how I feel about, about
Can you feel me? Cuz I'm feeling you to
Uh, uh

[Makeba Mooncycle]
Erased from your memory, exhaulted from the high
Redemption necessary, yes, remember, please try
The culture one, extraordinary, skills used to battle
Cutting off your head, leaving your tail at the rattle
The truth will hit you, knock you out, with great intention
Taking the past, bringing it up like hyper tension
Did I forget to mention? Yes, excuse me just a minute
Gather information, don't stop, before you finish
That's selling information, conceal in hidden lies
The poor righteous teaching, give me what you can't buy
Now we getting down to business, who created contradictions
Saying one thing, but having two different meanings
And if we human beings, whose you to demand?
Selling all originals from east to western land
You may not find this information, surfing on the net
Cuz everything's controlled and not written in the text
Formation of these nations, not united, but divided
Greed change you heart, using tactics so coniving
I shine my light on wicked ways, that lead me through the night
And since missed those slaves, they might, kill us on sight
Can you feel me?

[Chorus: Makeba Mooncycle]
Lalalalala, can you feel me? I'm feeling you too
Lalalalala, can you feel me? I'm feeling you too
Lalalalala, can you feel me? I'm feeling you too
Lalalalala, can you feel me? I'm feeling you

[Makeba Mooncycle]
Do you remember me? I'm like pain your molars
Don't forget I brung consciousness to your daughters
I keeps it flowing like free refills
You wack MC's, I'm hunting like good will
Ignored your existence like the black Holocaust
Tired of the blaim, could care less about the loss
My gun will let off, my extinction, you have saught
Could never be the one to run, yes, I set it off
No reality concerns, they in love with Pulp Fiction
If I say it twice, then clever be my diction
Like science fiction, back in the days, lost in space
Tried to find the truth, every thing leaves a trace
I feel for you devils, battle for destruction
Nothing is forgotten, another reconstruction
Cypher is complete, trinities giving meanings
Connection maintains, yet, a negative reading
I get stressed enough, the importance of knowledge
We absorbing like sponges, that's why we're divided
False for advertisements, full of bullshit
I admit to the following cuz I'm not having it
From matrix to hatred, what has this world gave us?
What has this world gave us? Can you feel me?

[Chorus]

[Makeba Mooncycle]
Through the Earth, holds us down like gravity
My style, wack MC's wanna marry me
I speak my shit with clarity
And have you spoken like a Shakespeare tragedy
Brooklyn united, my kingdom took my knowledge past freedom
Left behind jealousy, envy and greed
Deep like seven seas, no wetting this received
Just pure energy, from the, God Degree
My thoughts are, hot like fire, soul savior for hire
My skills you admire, my lyrics you desire
No justice, no peace, sharp as a crease
Your death will be tragic, as my lyrics become classics
Classics, can you feel me? Yeah, yeah, I'm feeling you too

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
