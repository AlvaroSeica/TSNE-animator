[Styles P]
Most of us came from a broken home
Drownin in my sorrows, drinkin liquor, tryin to smoke alone
Argue with my wife so I broke my phone
Throw it on the wall, tryin to ball, but they playin zone
Connect is actin funny with the work
Like my money didn't work, they gon' end up gettin merked
The label actin funny with the deal
like the shit that I be spittin on the record wasn't real
Hood mad but they know a nigga ride
But the hate and jealousy can blow a nigga high
The other day I said I know a nigga fucked
When I played the bodega, it was two dollars for the Dutch
To keep it real, we livin in real time
And I feel a nigga's pain but they never can feel mine
And so I'm on the go with the green light
I don't even sleep, how the fuck could I dream right?

[Chorus: Rell]
Yayyyy-yeahhh-yeahh; they keep tellin me things gettin better
Yayyyy-yeahhh-yeahh; but I'ma do me, you can say whatever
I'm a G

[Styles P]
Ghost, never on the swag shit
Guess it's a sad thing my tarot card is magic
I remember I ain't never have shit
December was cold but, February was drastic~!
So pardon my niggaz and what they traffic
or if they seem cold when the murder scene's tragic
Niggaz can talk shit, we don't even glimpse
Niggaz can get hit, we don't even wince
Come with an +Entourage+ and I don't mean Vince
Purple ape in a purple Porsche, of course I'm playin Prince
or lookin through the sky light, my light
And I zip my lips the minute they read my rights
Blowin on a long Dutch, inhale
How I lie I'd rather die than be in jail
It's all good 'til it's all bad
And the ugly niggaz gon' crash your broad's pad

[Chorus]

[Styles P]
I keep it movin in my new J.O.'s
On them blocks, where them young boys move llello
They salute like "Whattup O.G.?" I salute
cause it's the +Wild Wild West+ like Kool Moe Dee
What they do for a two-door B, and a nice watch
Blow your brains out when the cocaine price drop
Like yeah I know my man got life ock
The game don't stop so pull the weed out your night sock
Yeah! It's like that ain't it?
My down South niggaz that got the Lex painted
My East coast niggaz that got the Benz kitted
Don't it hurt when they snitch and you found out your friends did it?
I thought it's money over bitches but
niggaz throw money at bitches so let's kick it
If you really live by the G code
Shoot a couple of guns, hurry up and reload

[Chorus]</pre>
