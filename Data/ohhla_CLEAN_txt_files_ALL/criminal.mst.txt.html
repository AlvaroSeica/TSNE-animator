(Fingazz)(Hook)
Hey you wanted to let you know (that)
G's like me are always up to no good (No good)
The one and I wanted to tell you what (cause)
G's like me... like criminals ... back to the G's

(Mr. Lil One)
Come in and say fuck you
You ain't the sick man
Don't give a shit fuck a trick all in my dick
You wanna slang in the middle of the rang
I want your gang to see you under a can
Motherfucker heard a bang and he ran
Headed up a jail and he sang damn
Who can I trust when I chose not to bust
Stupid bitch it ain't love it's all lust
You must be crazy thinking you could faze me
Get your memory load it up erase me
I'm the king in the middle of your thought world
You're a phem in this universe of rote world
Looking for a freebee believe me
Rapping wit your eyes closed... you can't see me
I leave it to the man to protect me
See the flames from the sun never sweat me

(Hook)(2x)

(Mr. Shadow)
Controlling the scene (scene)
Controlling the streets (street)
Read fools like a book it's just a g and me
1-3 on my arms cause bodily harm
Shut your doors and your windows and ring the alarm
I'm the loose (loose)
Frowning you hear the dogs growling
It's foggy outside your whole house is surrounded
Westside of S-D and I bang with this
And you sucker mother fuckers can't hang with this
I aim my shit and blast
Do it faster than fast
I want my money and cash
I'm smoking chronic with hash
All in your ass with some new shit
You roll around with fake fools who won't do shit
You silly faggot this is criminal activities
And not a single petty minded motherfucker in this bitch is getting rid of
me
Go ahead and get at me
Shadow O.G. The Mistah ain't nobody else like me
You haters listen

(Hook)

(Mr. Sancho)
Ruthless
Abusing leaving you fools toothless
Got webos to blow hips up
No need to shoot this
Face to face toe-to-toe is all I know
Aint even in the back of an ally putting on a show
Gonna take the hit on the blunt
Gonna make a hit on you punks
It's Sancho, Lil one and Shadow we not giving a fuck, (what)
Criminal minded, criminal's blinded by the fact that we dying
To the top of the game we popping these days
Showing everyone we got a lock in this game
Chicanos refunding cuetes and filerors
Fucking around with these two Pandeiros
No me llames y me listo primero
No te burles por qu√© hablo en serio
Calmado, hijo de la chingada no mas mi la maman
Puta los tenies con mis palabras
Habla con mis manos que te discalabran (trucha)

Q'Vole soy Sancho hijos de la chingada
Mr. Sancho para ti putos
Eschucha muy bien o ti discalabro la mente puto
