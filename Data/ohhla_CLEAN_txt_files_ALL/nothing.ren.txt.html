[Intro: Bigg Rocc]
Say hell yeah (HELL YEAH!!)
Say hell yeah (HELL YEAH!!)
Say hell yeah (HELL YEAH!!)
Say hell yeah (HELL YEAH!!)
Say Fuck that shit (FUCK THAT SHIT!!)
Say fuck that shit (FUCK THAT SHIT!!)
Say fuck that shit (FUCK THAT SHIT!!)
Now scream (HHHHHAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYY!!)

[Verse One: MC Ren]
Who the motherfucking boss nigga spell at the villain
We make them feel us, the presidents be begging to kill us
Dope dealers and the FEDs, bitches, fucking my head
Niggaz dying over colors, nigga blue and the red
What 'Ren gotta do to expose your ass?
Gay bitches on the mic homey making me mad
Really who fucking with Ren?
I don't give a fuck, how many book should be there?
I'm a fucking veteran
R-E-N niggaz, know what it mean
V-I-L-L homey seldom seen
I'm with that nigga Bigg (Rocc) homey puffing the green
I'm sick of bitches always asking why; I look mean
We got fucked up schools, fucked up stores
Nobody gives a fuck about the niggaz no more
Then they got the nerve to ask what this for
This for motherfuckers growing up in the ghetto

[Chorus: MC Ren]
We're the shit nigga, don't need nothing
John Doe coming through, fool we're dumping
Motherfuckers mad cause we always make something
To make their shit nigga, look like nothing - What?

We're the shit nigga, don't need nothing
John Doe coming through, fool we're dumping
Motherfuckers mad cause we always make something
To make their shit nigga, look like nothing - it's nothing

(*Sound of police Sirens*)

[Verse Two: Bigg Rocc]
I come through repping while niggaz be half stepping
Choose my weapon, letting loose in your section
Fake-Ass chrome niggaz shot the next man 
I'ma buy my own cheese, smoking in the cali' grease
Ride nigga - do or die, my niggaz
Full of Alcohol, ready to pull big triggers
High Powered, street kings, reigned by killers
Gangbangers, phoney-Ass Cop, dope dealers
Prostitutes, horny-Ass mayors; wanna be mack players
Spend your paper, beware of the kill
Deal or get dealt with, I'm not the nigga to cross
It's nothing to a boss
To peel to a motherfucker, kill a motherfucker
Be real to a motherfucker, so chill motherfuckers
But shit gets start you can't heal motherfucker
It's on for life like paying bills motherfucker

[Chorus: MC Ren] </pre>
