[Intro]
{So, do you party?} Nah, I just do ignorant hoodrat shit
with me and my niggaz in the fuckin mall!
Odd Future Wolf Gang

[Jasper Dolphin]
Niggaz at the fuckin mall, niggaz where my fuckin drawers?
Think I'm happy? Think I'm sad? Bitch you fuckin know my dad
He wears his pants up in his ass, touch his ass, grab his dick
Youse a fag, you like that shit, O.F. is the fuckin clique
Going off the top of the brain
Nigga don't know how to rap but I'm in the game
Fuck that shit~! I don't give a fuck
I'm back up in the fuckin club, niggaz know I'm at the mall
Eating chips with my drawers
How you doin? How you fall?

[Chorus]
Swag, swag, swag, swag {*2X*}
Tina, perm yo' fuckin weave {*4X*}

[Tyler, the Creator]
Eat my ass, lick my balls, bitch I'm in the fuckin mall
with my niggaz eatin ham (MMMMMmmmmmmmm) yo!!
Bitch I got that fuckin swag, you don't know my fuckin dad
I don't know my fuckin dad, what is this a fuckin purse?
I ain't fucking Mexican, but we can have sex again
wit'cha your sister with no rubber (Alexis' real name is Alex)
What the fuck? That's yo' fuckin brother? I ain't with that jerkin shit
Unless it's Steve Harvey's buff sister tryin to jerk my dick

[Chorus]

{*screaming SWAG repeatedly and saying "oh no" throughout*}

[Taco]

Uhh, uhh, ohh shit ohh, mmmmm, mmm

Alright, yeah

Yeah, swag!

[Chorus] - 2X
