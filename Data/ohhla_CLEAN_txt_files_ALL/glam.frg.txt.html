Are you ready?

[Polow Da Don]
If you ain't got no money, take yo' broke ass home
You say (If you ain't got no money, take yo' broke ass home)

[Fergie]
G-L-A-M, O-R, O-U-S, yeah
G-L-A-M, O-R, O-U-S

1 - We flyin' first class, up in the sky
    Pop the champagne, livin' the life
    In the fast lane, I won't change
    By the glamorous
    Ooh, the floss-y flossin'

2 - The glamorous
    The glamorous, the glamorous
    By the glamorous
    Ooh, the floss-y flossin'

    The glamorous
    The glamorous, the glamorous
    By the glamorous
    Ooh, the floss-y flossin'

[Fergie]
I wear them gold and diamond rings
All them things don't mean a thing
Chaperone's and limousine's
Shoppin' for expensive things
I be on the movie screens, magazine's and bougie scenes
I'm not clean, I'm not pristine
I'm no queen, I'm no machine
I still go to Taco Bell, drive-thru, raw as hell
I don't care, I'm still real
No matter how many records I sell
After the show or after the Grammy's
I like to go cool out with the family
Sip and reminiscin' on days when I had a Mustang
And now I'm..

Repeat 1
Repeat 2

[Ludacris]
Talkin' champagne wishes
Caviar dreams
You deserve nothin' but all the finer things
Now this whole world has no clue what to +do with us+
I got enough money in the bank for the +two of us+
Plus I gotta keep enough lettuce to support your shoe fetish
Lifestyles so Rich and Famous, Robin Leach'll get jealous
Half a million for the +stones+
Takin' trips from here to +Rome+
So if you ain't got no money, take yo' broke ass home

[Fergie]
G-L-A-M, O-R, O-U-S, yeah
G-L-A-M, O-R, O-U-S

Repeat 1
Repeat 2

[Fergie]
I got problems up to here
I got people in my ear
Tellin' me these crazy things that I don't wanna know (Fuck ya'll)
I got money in the bank and I'd really like to thank
All the fans I'd like to thank, thank you really though
Cause I remember yesterday when I dreamt about them days
When I'd rock on MTV, that'd be really dope
Damn it's been a long road and the industry is cold
I'm glad my daddy told me so, he let his daughter know

[Polow Da Don] {Fergie}
If you ain't got no money, take yo' broke ass home {My daddy told me so}
You say (If you ain't got no money, take yo' broke ass home)
{He let his daughter know}

If you ain't got no money, take yo' broke ass home {My daddy told me so}
You say (If you ain't got no money, take yo' broke ass home)
{He let his daughter know}</pre>
