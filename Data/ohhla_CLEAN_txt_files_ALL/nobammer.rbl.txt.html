Song:   Don't Give Me No Bammer
Typed by: jostmatt@bluewin.ch

[ CHORUS: Black C ]
Don't gimme no bammer weed
(Get with the program)
(Just smoke that dank)
We don't smoke that shit in the SFC		(4X)

[ VERSE 1: Mr. Cee ]
3, 2, 1, comin in with a bang
It's 2 dark-skinned niggas, not a muthafuckin gang
Pimps with limps, never known as simps
We smoke dank, not the bammer shit
Damn, that bammer ain't no good
You might as well smoke some rolled up wood
And you laughed and said those rhymes was funny
But trip on the sense that I'm stressin, you punk-ass dummy
Get with the program
Can't you see bammer ain't nothin but a scammer
False high, nothin but a untrue affair
Or a everyday lie to dank ???
Ain't it a gram that you seek to gain?
Once knew a girl named Brenda
Smokin that bammer was her everyday agenda
She used to laugh and giggle
Until Mr. Cee moved next to her building
I tried to get her but she acted kinda shob
So I shared my dank, I got her real high
She followed me up to a room
And for you bitches, honey boomb, honey boom
We smoked mo' dank without a pause
And later that night I was in them drawers
See, Frisco niggas ain't no punks
Put guns in our way and they're gonna get pumped
Oh, Brenda's now hoein in the Point
Couldn't handle the dank, the reason - bammer joints

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 2: Black C ]
Don't gimme no bammer joint
It's the Black C, nigga, gettin straight to the point
I was chillin outside on a hot day
It was me and my niggas, just check what I say
Let's fade, let's go see the dank man
They'll fade if they is my friends
A few niggas pitched in
(Let's go to the store so I can get some gin)
Oh no, straight Hen-dog on mine
With a little dab of Coke and a nigga doin fine
So now we got a nitro
We up, yeah, let's go hit the indo
In fo' deep we creep
It's about to be a party in a 5.0 Jeep
Nigga straight checkin the mirror
One nigga in the back had a St. Ides beer
Urlin like fuck in my backseat
I made him buy five grams and clean up the mess, gee
Straight Hen-dog with no chaser
Fuck that beer, ain't nothin greater
A-B, our name: C
And you gotta pause when you get to the D
D for dank, D for drink
But not D for the dope that's stackin my bank
There's only two things that I smoke
A punk-ass nigga or a pipe full of indo
I like nothin but the real McCoy
Straight dank, fuck a bammer joint

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 3: Black C ]
Is it gold, is it green, is it brown?
(No, it's Black C breakin em buds down)
Or should I say them indo clusters
Never want homegrown cause I'm a indo lover
Trip on the shit that I say
Or go take a trip to go get the shit 
D to the a to the a to the n to the k
(Niggas know what's up) So what more can I say?
If it's in a zag or a pipe
It's quite expensive, so you better smoke it right
Get a few niggas to fade
Find a cut, a chizurp in a shade
And like meat belongs to a meal
Grab a 40 with the dank cause it's time to get ill
It's better than crack cocaine
It ain't medicine, but it'll ease the pain
And if you find right you're in luck
That and the Ides got you amped as fuck
Now for the journey or quest
And creepin for some sex but don't forget the latex
Niggas like each other lesser and lesser
But on the dank tip let's come together
You call it herb, some call it sess
But if it's called bammer don't smoke that mess

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 4: Mr. Cee ]
Once again it's the muthafuckin Mr. Cee
From Harbor Road, gee
Just gimme a couple of zigzags
So I can roll a fat one and take a drag
Now I ain't got no time for playin
I just wanna smoke my dank, and
Niggas always say don't smoke that bammer
What's that word by MC Hammer?
Shit, it ain't 'proper'
The nigga who sold it to ya gotcha
Straight up gaffled
Now you're lookin confused, or should I say baffled
But don't let it kill ya
Cause a Hunters Point nigga will ???? it to ya
The smoke gets straight to the head
And next you're put head to bed
Then you start to dreamin, wonderin
You say to yourself (Damn, that dank was bumpin)
Ooh, ah, look at that hoe
But don't open that door, you got to cop that blow
Nigga say that while rollin in a ride at the same time
Listen to the bassline
By T.C.
And my nigga named Black C
Poem like d-o-p-e
Sayin fresh rhymes for the RBL Posse
?????????????????????????????
Boy, I said it backwards, can I come smoother?
That't that dank shit
Time to pull another lick
RBL to the ninjas:
Our mission: to go and jack niggas
For their indo sacks, to be exact
We 2 are like straight macks
See, we got straight to the point
Cause we don't smoke no bammer joints
