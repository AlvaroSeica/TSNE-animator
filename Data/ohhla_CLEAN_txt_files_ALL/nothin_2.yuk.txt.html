[Yukmouth]
Haha... I can't believe you niggaz
You can't be serious
You really thought since 'Pac died the West coast fell the fuck off, huh?
You thought since Dre ain't made a album, we flopped?
Fuck that shit nigga!
Rap-A-Lot for life nigga!
Yukmouth nigga!
West Coast don nigga!
What's wit it punk?!
It's nuthin to a boss nigga!
We been ridin on dubb's that spin nigga!
We been poppin bottles, nigga, since 'Pac was alive nigga
The West Coast is back you faggot ass fucks!

[Verse 1]
I'm from the West Coast and never-ever crip-walk
I'm like the Bird Man, platinum grill, big cross
an I'm tryin to sell a few mill like Kris Kross
I'm ultra cocky, tell a chicken get lost
diss the boss an get ya lips ripped off
I let clips off
ya whole click soft
what you know about a hundred on a wrist watch
twenty on ya chicks watch
loungin Gucci flip flops
and I bang in the club like Rick Rock
Yuk show you how to rock that real thug hip-hop
they ride lo-lo's
Yukmouth flip drops
off the floor every year is a whip hop
menage-a-trios all year if ya chick jock
with ten karats in my ear like big shot
Godzilla get the scrilla like Chris Rock
an I'ma bring the West back when my shit drop

[Chorus - Benjilino]
To roll around on 24's
wit plenty millions in a vouge
everything a nigga want..
It's nothin 2 a boss!
So much ice a nigga froze
custom rides wit 310's
until I die it's all West coast
It's nothin big to a boss!

[Verse 2]
Yeah... if you gon' do it, do it right
I'm in the blue and white
rally striped Vipe leavin Peanuts wit a crew of dykes
Tuesday night I got my game together
I'm dangerous fella
my rims spin like plane propellers
an I'm down wit Prince James forever
Rap-A-Lot fo' lia (life)
Yukmouth, Scarface an Tela
and ya'll know Yuk is off the meter
for all you non-believers
I spark the heater
I'm what you call a block leader
Why you hatin?
I roll through ya radio station wit Gary Payton
in a franchise Lac outside on cherry Dayton's
an rock the new blue Burberry
make every nation feel the thug vibration, uh
my cars talk back like Michael Knight
I got a hunderd on a Roy Jones and Tyson fight
you wanna roll wit baller, well tonight's ya night
I rock ice cause the price is right
step it up hater. Yeah

[Chorus]
To roll around on 24's
wit plenty millions in a vouge
everything a nigga want..
It's nothin 2 a boss!
So much ice a nigga froze
custom rides wit 310's
until I die it's all West coast
It's nothin big to a boss!

[Verse 3]
Every day I'm poppin a bottle, and poppin a tag
fourty G's in a Gucci bag, I'm coppin a Jag
two-hundred G's in a Louie bag, I'm coppin a pad
wit the dragon shaped tool in the bag
What you know about that?!
What you know about chronic an Hypnotic
coppin Lamborghini's from 310 an Simbalic
drop stretch Hummers, twenty-four inch rims on it
??? skin interior wit the suede trim on it, wait!
I came in the game wit mobsta tales
I hit Mr. Chow's for meals, crack lobster tails
at the mall wit a model who only buys Chanelle
you wish I fell, but I prevail, Yukmouth is ill
I rock the 'Wheels of Fortune' like Pat Sajack
in a black Maybach
I'm tryin to bring the Bay back
in a A's throw back and a A's hat
Yuk a beast, and bleach couldn't fade that!
What?!

[Chorus]
To roll around on 24's
wit plenty millions in a vouge
everything a nigga want..
It's nothin 2 a boss!
So much ice a nigga froze
custom rides wit 310's
until I die it's all West coast
It's nothin big to a boss!</pre>
