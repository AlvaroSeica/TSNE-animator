All the way live
From the cornfields of Romeo, Michigan
Detroit, rock city
Two, double-o three, and four
The early morning, stoned, motherfuckin' cowboy
Here we go

Kid motherfuckin' Rock, call what you know
I got them bitches and them riches and that old school flow
Big nuts and such, you can't even front
I got it all bitch, so what'chu what'chu want
I can do it better than Jordan playing ball at twenty-two
Quicker than Rod Carou, sicker than Motley Crue
Who? Yeah, motherfucker, The Who too
Beatles, Stones, The Ramones, Trick and U2

A fucking country, rock, soul-singing MC
A fucking country, rock, soul-singing MC

I've got the brakes to shake the whole United States
Earthquakes couldn't recreate my shake
No fake, no make-up, who relates
Check these rhymes, motherfucker, they all first takes
No fucking around, I put it down
Pop your shit, but don't pop it in my hometown
Cause I flow down Motown sound shit
The motor city ain't nothing to fuck with

I'm the flyest, there's none flyer
I'm the highest, there's none higher
I spit truth, I've never been a liar
And I won't stop rockin' till I retire

A fucking country, rock, soul-singing MC
