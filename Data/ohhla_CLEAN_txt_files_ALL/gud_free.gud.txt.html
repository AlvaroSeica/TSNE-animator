Ok, I walked up in the club like fuck these niggas
Treat them like a soda can, I'm a crush these niggas
I know they don't like it, cause they ain't nothing like me
So I walk up in this bitch and start to check niggas like nike
I'm a bad ass like boosie, riding round with my uzzi
Cock back and I shoot it, turn your head into a smoothie
Riding around in my vet, bumping money, power respect
I don't run behind these hoes, but I'm chasing after respect
I got 2 chains like Titi, I'm getting all my dollars boy
Players in my circle snatching squares by the collar boy
Real nigga for certain, my lil niggas is murking
If you peeking out your blinds, I'm a make you pull your curtains
I'm on south beach and I'm lurking, seen a bad bitch that's perfect
Take her back to my room, eat her up and then I burp it
Glass house no tints, all the bitches squinting
I'm tryina buy some land, I ain't worried about no renting
I got hustle, I got flow, God damn it I'm so gifted
I got purp in my sprite, God damn I'm so lifted
My og just came home so I told him that it's on
You ain't gotta sell no work, all we selling is wayne tones
Yeah the shit right here is murda, I cook it like a burger
I run up in your crib and steal a nigga like a burglar
Yeah the shit right here is murda, I cook it like a burger
I run up in your crib and steal a nigga like a burglar

Ok, I walked up in the club like fuck these niggas
Treat them like a soda can, I'm a crush these niggas
I know they don't like it, cause they ain't nothing like me
So I walk up in this bitch and start to check niggas like nike
Check niggas like nike, check niggas like nike
So I walk up in this bitch and start to check niggas like nike
Ok, I walked up in the club like fuck these niggas
Treat them like a soda can, I'm a crush these niggas</pre>
