[intro]
Yeah dope boy, this is the official hustler's anthem
You gettin money, throw it in the air

[Young Jeezy]
Guess who's bizzack (back)
Still smell the blow in my clothes
Like Krispy Kreme, I was cookin them O's (cookin them O's)
Like horse shoes, I was tossin them O's
Time to re-up gotta recycle the flow ('cycle the flow)
I'm emotional, I hug the block (aye)
I'm so emotional (I love my glock)
Cash rules everything around me, so what's realer?
'Bout the scrilla, call me a +Ghostface Killah+ (yep)
It's kinda hard to be drug-free
When Georgia Power won't give a nigga lights free
Switch hustle, been killin 'em ever since (since)
It pays to tell the truth dawg, it only makes sense

[Chorus: Young Jeezy]
When they play that new Jeezy all the dope boys go crazy (geah)
and watch the dope boys go crazy
I pop my collar then I swing my chain
You can catch me in the club, pimpin doin my thang (heyy)
When they play that new Jeezy all the dope boys go crazy (geah)
and watch the dope boys go crazy
You pop your collar then you swing your chain
For all the gangstas in the street that be doin they thang (heyy)

[Young Jeezy]
Buy eighteen the hard way (let's get it)
Have a humble nigga thinkin about gun play (geah)
Now who the fuck wanna play wit guns?
A lot of holes, a lot of blood dawg, the shit ain't fun (nope)
So I suggest you don't play wit my chains
I'll send these hollows at ya, let 'em play wit ya brain (that's right)
These streets is watchin, the name is warm
The product's white, a star is born (yeahh)
Pimpin I'm so fly, if I take this parachute off, I might fall and die (damnn)
Wrap the work like spandex wit the latex (geah)
Then we ship it out of town, call it safe sex (heyy)

[Chorus]

[Jay-Z]
Uh, more than a hustla I'm the definition of it
Master chef, lord of the kitchen cupboard
More than a street legend, homey it's Hova
More than a relief pitcher, I'm the closer
The Mariano of the Mariott, ah
If money talks, the whole world's bout to hear me out
See I'm a hustler's hope, I'm not his pipe dreams
So when they speak of success, I'm what they might mean
Attract money my worst color is light green
My favorite hue is Jay-Z blue
Don't follow me young'n, follow my moves, I'm not a role model
A bad influence got the world drinkin gold bottles
When Puff was in that tub spillin Mo'
I was at my video, Cris' on the speedboat
In my lifetime nigga, go through your research
St. Thomas my nigga, that was me first
Chrome shoe'd the GS, I came feet first
In the game like a baby boo on the reach birth
I got the keys if you need work
I can kingpin you a line, the diamond of time (uhh)
My niggaz love it when I talk like this
My corporate people start buggin cause I talk like this
The corporate thugs is like, "Nah Hov, talk that shit"
The dope boys go crazy when they hear that boy Jay-Z
See I'ma 80's baby, mastered Reaganomics
School of Hard Knocks, everyday is college
You ain't did nothin I ain't did, nigga pay homage
or pay the doctor, I sprayed Lami's
Still, the time'll reveal, you know I'm bein honest
Ya ain't put my coat yet and I keep my shit in coat check
They say the truth shall come to the light
So everybody grab your chains cause your boy that bright

[Chorus]</pre>
