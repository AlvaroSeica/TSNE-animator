YOU BACKTHEFUCKUP!
Cause I've had enough
They put the evil in chains and handcuffs
They hope that people will change and have love
They hope the weak will rise and stand tough
I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN
Maybe it's just an experiment from the scientist
Maybe the reason that most of the people are buyin this
They're all in search of solution, that's why they tryin this

I'm beside myself and I don't understand
I need some time to breathe and
Wake up from my master plan
I don't fit in
but I'm sure in no time I'll be on your shit list
then you'll..

WELCOME HOME!
When you come down..
WELCOME HOME!
Come here with me..
WELCOME HOME!
When you come down..
WELCOME HOME! HOME! HOME!
Come here with me..
WELCOME HOME!
When you come down..
WELCOME HOME!
Come here with me..
WELCOME HOME!
When you come down..
WELCOME HOME! HOME! HOME! HOME! HOME!

Sick games with sick ways to play though
Don't say no names or get smushed out like play-doh
They put my name, stature in limbo
then it all pops like a sawed of gage (oh!)
Shoot the place, nobody is givin a fuck
Street teams and big trucks, and driveways stuck
With no bucks and you can chalk it up to bad luck
But on the real muthafucka, your music just sucks
I'm a quicka eater like a ego
and choke your fuckin neck till you're beggin me to let go
everybody warned you, I know because you said so
but now you makin t-shirts in your basement, stealin my instrumentals
Monumental and detrimental
the one that that make me wanna slit you
I'm holdin my son, holdin the gun, holdin it down, holdin the sound
Forever I'm underground, so hear me now

When you come down..
WELCOME HOME!
Come here with me..
WELCOME HOME!
When you come down..
WELCOME HOME! HOME! HOME!
Come here with me..
WELCOME HOME!
I'm beside myself
WELCOME HOME!
and I don't understand
WELCOME HOME!
I need some time to breathe and
WELCOME HOME! HOME! HOME! HOME! HOME!

Bitches are nervous cuz we got up on the pigs
So they sickin to hide and try to thicken they clip
I got a clip for the whole squad
and if we get to shootin them termin ninjas is screamin out "oh my god"
Help me lord, been irritated and imitated
and even hated for the fact that my face is painted
Maybe it's prejudice, I realize and recognize the fact
The envisionist company, they gon turn it white and black
Writin bars like the others, don't matter color or creed
When they say with animosity
No undisputed enemies appalled
Y'all dicks got no balls, because the real biggest mob of them all is city hall
We the product of environment, ghetto till we finish
Till the day that we retire and close out for business
I know you feelin this, you wellin up inside
But the clip in ya heata, pull the trigga, and let's ride

WELCOME HOME!
I'm beside myself
WELCOME HOME!
and I don't understand
WELCOME HOME!
I need some time to breathe and
WELCOME HOME! HOME! HOME!
Come here with me..
WELCOME HOME!
I don't fit in
WELCOME HOME!
But I'm sure in no time
WELCOME HOME!
I'll be on your shit list
WELCOME HOME! HOME! HOME! HOME! HOME!</pre>
