[Verse One] [KBimean]
Cuts is more than bionic
Ironman with the timin'
I can see wires comin' out his arms when he's on
Revolution is a beast, spin crazy like The Shining
Terminator with the wax
Renaissance Megatron
The first time I heard him I thought he had, 20 arms
The Techniques was speakin' to me while he was choppin' up the drum
All in all
Rev is a machine with his hands
That's why it seems he's more of a machine than a man
