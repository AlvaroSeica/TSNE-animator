[Chali 2na]
Yo, this is a lesson in friendship, the depths of a kinship
What women and men begin with and then slip
My pen drips as I scribble my thoughts on thin strips of emotion
A fraction, seduction, attraction, eruption of passion
Corrupts if a lasted friendship's involved
Would love to cross the line but that's why we built these walls

[Hook: Jurassic 5]
We been friends for a long time, a very close friend of mine
Love ya like ya was mine but respect the thin line
I love ya like ya was mine, think about ya all the time
Very close friend of mine but respect the thin line


[Akil]
Opposite's attract when the female and male come in contact
Sticky situation, in fact tryin' not to let the feelings catch
But there's a thin line between both of y'all so you respect that
And entertain the idea but get brought back- to reality
And could you really live with that- decision based on intuition?
You love and keep it distant, hug and kiss in friendship

[Marc 7]
An ongoing kinship, we was people to begin with
Disrespect was not intended but your feelings sparked the sentence
Sometimes you're too intense in your quest to invent- the perfect man Please
understand my rhyme is your repent

[Hook: Jurassic 5 and Mya together]
We been friends for a long time, a very close friend of mine
Love ya like ya was mine but respect the thin line
I love ya like ya was mine, think about ya all the time
Very close friend of mine but respect the thin line
We been friends for a long time, a very close friend of mine
Love ya like ya was mine but respect the thin line
I love ya like you was mine, think about ya all the time
Very close friend of mine but respect the thin line

[Soup]
Man too bad that we became friends first
And I'm not an expert on how relationships should work
But {*echoes*} from the minute it was known
It changed the whole tone, the way we spoke on the phone
Yo it was cool but I felt it wasn't enough
And I was stuck when your moms would pick it up
Over you all my buddies would swoon
But I felt we were in tune
You let me up in your room (damn)
But to me girl you're still off limits
No matter all the times that I hinted (yo, what you doin' after this?)
Infactuation was authentic
But yo I just pretended so I wouldn't lose the friendship
Maybe I should spill all my guts
Or write a letter then tear it up
Or do a song just to say what's up
I want... just... a touch

[Hook: Jurassic 5 and Mya together]
We been friends for a long time, a very close friend of mine
Love ya like ya was mine but respect the thin line
I love ya like ya was mine, think about ya all the time
Very close friend of mine but respect the thin line
We been friends for a long time, a very close friend of mine
Love ya like ya was mine but respect the thin line
I love ya like you was mine, think about ya all the time
Very close friend of mine but respect the thin line

[Mya]
What happens if we cross the line?
Can't take it back, can't ever go back
Damn you're such a good friend to me now
But the attraction's undeniable
See I know ya as my brother but could see you as my lover
So what am I gonna do now?
Cuz physical relations want confrontation
Ooh what are we gonna do now?

[Chali 2na]
Yo, this was a lesson in friendship
I stress in this sentence:
Should women and men be friends first and then slip?
My pen drips as I scribble my thoughts on thin strips of devotion

[Akil]
Opposites attract and best friends make a perfect match
If you only knew that
But once you cross, ain't no turning back
The minute you let him in it and he hit that, that's that

[Marc 7]
We was people to begin with but you was too relentless
Jeporidizing kinship, respect is intended, resolve is my intent
While we got it in I'm tryin to salvage a friendship

[Hook: Jurassic 5 and Mya together]
We been friends for a long time, a very close friend of mine
Love ya like ya was mine but respect the thin line
I love ya like ya was mine, think about ya all the time
Very close friend of mine but respect the thin line
We been friends for a long time, a very close friend of mine
Love ya like ya was mine but respect the thin line
I love ya like you was mine, think about ya all the time
Very close friend of mine but respect the thin line</pre>
