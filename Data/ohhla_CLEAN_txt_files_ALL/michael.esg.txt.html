You know the type of niggaz, that claim they moving work 
But soon as the FED's come, they singing like Gerald Levert 
Them the type I like to merk, yep as soon as they hit the cell 
They point they fingers at me, call em hoes Patti Labelle 
Yeah the 40 cal short, but the AK is long 
The laws hit they home, they go to singing like Trey Songz 
Get caught with a brick, and a couple hundred pounds
