Typed by: fywhla@yahoo.com

[Intro]
Yeah, you heard of the world famous Alkaholik crew, right?
Yeah, you heard of Defari, right?

[Chorus]
(You got the fire huh?)
Step up and I'll dump
You real not fake then smack ya face
You feelin' all the bass then smack ya face
You like it straight with no chase then smack ya face
(You got the heat huh?)
Step up and I'll dump
You real not fake then smack ya face
You feelin' all the bass then smack ya face
You like it straight with no chase then smack ya face

[Defari]
Lookin' at my guchi it's about show time
An Alkaholik King, hit the stage with dope rhymes
Defari is the name, shout it out
To them explain why I would never bottom out
I deal with pain
Now they can all talk about - my claim to fame
How that nigga slung it out, and changed the game
Revolution, the DJ phenomenon's producin'
Now he's the solution -
To all these weak ass beats I hear year after year
All day in my ear
Goodyear tires fit 23's
I get higher off the trees and the Hennessey's
Loyalties, so important to the royalty of Likwit
If you niggaz wasn't knowin' me
The cavalier, unprecidented brigadier general
Grab the mic then let it go
All the glory and frustration from many years
All the intoxication from many beers
I break bread with my peers..
Then play the star of the bar like Norm from Cheers

[Chorus]

[Defari]
Crash, harder than paint, hit the glass
Another Jack Daniels, throw away my cash
Another ghetto dude that likes the hash
Oh, the blunts just been lit man, hit and pass
Why oh why is Defari so fire, fire
Alkaholiks is the crew the whole world admire
Break West, the Pacific Coast's best
All-Star, with the lions heart in his chest
I rock tours, rock academic valours
See, many have come, but not many endour
Through the heartache's and pain
The bubble and the trouble, the -
Arguments, the tustle and the hustle
I manifest destiny, it's still not the best of me
My prime is a time that's now, they can't "F" with me
Blow a G, blow a tree, throw an O.D. back
Hit a hook and your face get smacked

[Chorus]

*scratching*

"Slap in you the face with the bass..." - Defari
"Smack your face..."</pre>
