Takin' it away
Takin' it away

[Bonez Dubb]
I need somethin' to eat, I'm fuckin' starvin' in this piece
Kinda feelin' deceased, somebody call a priest
I'm fuckin' empty, cause they don't give a fuck about me
You know I can't pay off the salary
I need the money, the green, cause I have no home
And Uncle Sam don't show no love to a broke ass Bonez (B-O-N-E-Z)
A twenty couldn't last me two weeks
I'm fuckin' used to chillin' on the curbs of these streets
I'm alright though, you I'm straight how I'm livin'
Here's how I roll - I know the place I was given
Bitches laugh when they walk by until they pass
Most of the time get pissed cause I smack they ass
It's just the Juggalo way, I pray to be okay
And don't give a fuck if bitches give me the time of day (aww, bitch!)
Cause eventhough I'm broke, I still get the skins
I don't need no Benjamin's or even Washington's
They takin' it away!

[Chorus]
I hate this shit, but need it cause it ain't nothin' free
Everywhere I go they keep on chargin' me
They keep on takin' it away (takin' it away)
They keep on takin' it away (takin' it away)

[Otis]
Hello! I'd like to introduce myself to you
My name is broker-than-broke, no joke, yo, fuck you
Ever since I was born, it's been the same old thang
Diggin' through my homie's couches steady lookin' for change
It used to cost 25 cents for pop in a can
But nowadays the machine try to eat your hand, but hey
It ain't really ain't shit to me
I still boss-man boogie in the middle of the streets
And this Juggalo shit ain't never gon' switch
Flat broke, but I still got a hot ass bitch
And this bitch is the shit, don't bitch at all
I mean, she ain't even a bitch, she a Juggalette (awwwwwww)
But don't mistake her for a easy-to-use
She'll hypnotize rich dudes for they loot like, "Jack move!"
Please believe it, scrubby's the way I live
Not just the way I'm treated, alright?
Peace, bitch

[Chorus]
I hate this shit, but need it cause it ain't nothin' free
Everywhere I go they keep on chargin' me
They keep on takin' it away (takin' it away)
They keep on takin' it away (takin' it away)

[Bridge]

[Otis]
Fuck money, all it ever does is hurt
And it never lives up to what people say it's worth
And fuck work, even if you earn somethin' you deserve
They still take it away, even if you're at church.

[Bonez]
Fuck money, all the bills on Earth couldn't buy
All the lies and sins I can see in your eyes
I despise the whole world cause it runs on flow
I'd rather smoke it all away through my bomb indo

[Otis]
Fuck money, man, y'all just don't get it
I say muthafuck money, man, and I ain't kiddin'
My whole life I watched moms bow her head over a pile of bills
So whoever's lovin' money is gettin' killed

[Bonez]
Fuck money, they're takin' it away from the broke
And give it back to the rich because of words they spoke
It's all taxes, what I ask is, the real fact is
Speak the truth before I cut your ass up with the axe, bitch.

[Chorus - 2X]
I hate this shit, but need it cause it ain't nothin' free
Everywhere I go they keep on chargin' me
They keep on takin' it away (takin' it away)
They keep on takin' it away (takin' it away)</pre>
