[Malcolm X]
You are the prodigal son, you are the lost sheep
You are the people about whom the Bible is speaking
who will stand up in the last days when the trumpet is sounded
Black people are waking up, black people are standing up
black people are rising up

[Antonio Chance aka Shanghai the Messenger]
Ooh ma, ma, ma, my Lord, Lord
I see chariots in the sky (skies)
Men on Earth look surprised
As they flow across the sky
And I see the light deep into the night
Up there on Mars among the stars in that distant land
Swift as light, we took our flight, the chosen people
Ooh ma, ma, ma, ma, my, Lord, Lord
The reasons why we here, ooh ma, ma, ma, ma, my
Lord, Lord, the reasons why we're here

[Killah Priest]
Before being born without physical form, avoiding the vast
My space voyage, begins between the asteroids
Before I landed upon the planet, and looked abandoned
Lost and stranded, I became a force that demanded
Life force took flight one course of the night, search for any source of life
Light was the know the ledge coming from the edge of the universe
Then passed the moon, to the earth, then from the womb to nurse
With a slight remembrance, how I came from a distance
To an instinct, resistance with 5 senses
The quest for man repentance
While others cry I exercised my third eye by hearing lullaby
Then I magnify inside, became intelligent and wise
Transform from the celestial
Shot through a sexual terrestrial, testicle vessel
Small as a decimal where I nestle
Nine months later, special delivery
The Killah P-R-I-E-S-T, from the fetus to the cleavage
From Atoms to Adams
From Atoms to Adams
From Atoms to Adams

[Antonio Chance aka Shanghai the Messenger]
I see chariots in the sky (skies)
Men on Earth look surprised
As they flow across the sky
And I see the light deep into the night
Up there on Mars among the stars in that distant land

[Killah Priest]
So I begin, between, the meteorite
Now I walk like Christ except I'm not the sacrificed but a righteous parasite
Searching' for paradise, which is the birth-right
Off a celestial Nazarite, with appetites to bite from the Tree of Life
The smite, Edomites, sodomite, Moorites
In the land of Canaanites following six flame of knights
Burning over 1 million degrees fahrenheit
Bright as, neon, beyond the satellites
Flight takes me over cattle stocks
Blocks of ice, I began to flock, flock, flock
Flock across Mecca with a vivid projector
Seeking my scepter looking, at, Rebecca
Two sons, bobbing through Jerusalem like a hoodlum
Ahhh, principalities enables me to see the other galaxy
Release all calories, backed by 8 authors, writers and ologies
I'm the author and the writer of a biography with God prophecies, to challenge Egyptology
Philosophies and Greek mythologies
Going through the glossaries of Socrates, with Pharisees and Sadducees
Going through genealogy with degrees I contact the Hasmonean dynasty
Approximately, one 68 BC transform from the Wu Killa Bee into the families of the Maccabeez
I can see every species in 3D, and hear them clear as CD's
Join my pilgrimage, I walked through the wilderness
I have the privilege the see the pyramids
Which gave me the will to live, to roam through the villages and heal the kids
Walk across the bridge strong as Farrakhan
As a voice echos like Sarah Vaughan across the great Amazon
Stretched out my hand like Yon
Until I reach Babylon, behold a physic phenomenon
Quiet storm, I wander out a horizon
From the top of holy Mount Zion
Holding a staff that turned into a python
Killah Priest, the living icon
Sitting in a form of a Pentagon, in the center of the Octagon
Walking from Tyre to Sidon, to Lebanon to the walls of Hong Kong
Reciting the 23rd Psalm, long gone, before the crack of dawn
Dodging and weaving, through the Garden of Eden, without eating
Speeding, throbbing, lobbing, devour the marked regions

(As they flow across the sky..)

Those that were uncivilized was chastised
While the civilized were baptized
12 tribes began to rise like bees from the hive
Causing seeds with their wives, starting apartheid
As the scribes carry the archives, follow the star guide
As we glide through the windows of the far side
Across the dark sky, then over the ocean tides
The Unidentified Flying Objects
Hovers the projects, scenery, gothic
The sky condense with darkness
As the thugs transform into prophets
The body becomes cosmic
As the floor becomes carpet
They rise from out the toxic
And the wasteland and the garbage
Where faces are various shades of chocolate
Dropping the narcotics, and the pork sausage
No longer held hostage

[Outro: (Killah Priest) Shanghai the Messenger]
(From 'Atoms to Adams')
As they flow across the sky
(From 'Atoms to Adams')
As they flow across the sky
(From 'Atoms to Adams')
And I see the light deep into the night
Up there on Mars among the stars, in that distant land
Swift as light we took our flight, the chosen people
Ooh ma, ma, ma, ma, my Lord, Lord
Ooh ma, ma, ma, ma, my</pre>
