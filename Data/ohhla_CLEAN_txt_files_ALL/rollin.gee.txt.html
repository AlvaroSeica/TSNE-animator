Chorus

Get yo shine on playa it's on now
You ain't thuggin' if you ain't ridin' on chrome now
Get yo shine on and chase yo richest
You want to roll right drop yo Benz on twenty inches

{B.G.}
I get that noise out these busters anything I ride
It's gonna have TV's in chrome on it wood inside
I got a variety of cars I can drive in 
I'm B. G.  whatever it is I'm gonna shine in
I don't be slipping' I'm on the issue believe me
Top of the line rollie on my wrist when ya see me
I want to be chauffeured in a Bentley
Haters can't take that so they plottin' to flip me
But I'm goon shake that a million dollars 
I'm try's make that these baler blacken' rookies
They hate that i don't wear nothing' cheap
From my head to my feet 
Twenty on my wrist ten on my cash money piece
You can't help but hear my name ringin' on the streets
From gettin' my ball on to Nelly and old lady
You can try to look through my grill and get blinded playa
All week long I like to shine playa 

Chorus

Get yo shine on playa it's on now
You ain't thuggin' if you ain't ridin' on chrome now
Get yo shine on and chase yo richest
You want to roll right drop yo Benz on twenty inches

Get yo shine on playa it's on now
You ain't thuggin' if you ain't ridin' on chrome now
Get yo shine on and chase yo richest
You want to roll right drop yo Benz on twenty inches

{B. G. }
Juvenile gave me a ride to the drop top cut dog
Let's creep downtown I know some girls
Who gon twerk dog keep yo phone on
Round eight I'm a call we gon click up
Drop it off in these broads draws
They only want to see a hot boy
Break 'em down I'm a represent
Because I'm from that Uptown
Plug get iced up do what ya gon do den
Let's split because it's goin' down on
Infrared and Washington I follow you in the Suburb
With the fifth rim chrome grill wood range stern wheel
Baby Gangsta is worth six figures plus
I'm thinkin' about a Lexus Truck For Christmas
I'm a put TV's in both of the head rest's 
Women live to please me I can't say I'm not blessed
Fresh look what rap got us 
Look what rap don bought us
We followin' each other on two big body's
On boulders 

Chorus

Get yo shine on playa it's on now
You ain't thuggin' if you ain't ridin' on chrome now
Get yo shine on and chase yo richest
You want to roll right drop yo Benz on twenty inches

Get yo shine on playa it's on now
You ain't thuggin' if you ain't ridin' on chrome now
Get yo shine on and chase yo richest
You want to roll right drop yo Benz on twenty inches

{B. G. }
I'm gettin' my ball on like I'm in the NBA
Hustle for a mil I do dat everyday
Me and my whole click we just shinnin'
House's and fancy car's all Big Tymers just buyin'
Lyin' to these broads because we got it like that
Black on black army truck we ridin' like that 
None of us want beef black brother's gettin' rich
We always follow this model trick's ain't it
Baby don't like to brag but he just bout a Jag
Ferriah, and Lambergine with TV and stash
That thing there fast and it's off the hook
We don't carry cash we all tot a check book
Leavin' haters in the dust competition shook
Step aside on yo own or wootay ya get pushed

Chorus

Get yo shine on playa it's on now
You ain't thuggin' if you ain't ridin' on chrome now
Get yo shine on and chase yo richest
You want to roll right drop yo Benz on twenty inches

Get yo shine on playa it's on now
You ain't thuggin' if you ain't ridin' on chrome now
Get yo shine on and chase yo richest
You want to roll right drop yo Benz on twenty inches

Get yo shine on playa

Get Get Get yo shine on playa 

Get yo shine on playa it's on now
You ain't thuggin' if you ain't ridin' on chrome now
Get yo shine on and chase yo richest
You want to roll right drop yo Benz on twenty inches

Get yo shine on playa it's on now
You ain't thuggin' if you ain't ridin' on chrome now
Get yo shine on and chase yo richest
You want to roll right drop yo Benz on twenty inches
