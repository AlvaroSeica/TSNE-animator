Long Live the Kings
Kings and Queens, raise your glass as I propose a toast
To the long living legacy, of the Kottonmouth Kings

What's good here we got the game on lock
We ain't goin nowhere, we still sittin on top
We still doing our thing
We still raining supreme
That's why everywhere we go they're yelling Kottonmout Kings

We still here we got the game on lock
We ain't goin nowhere, we still sittin on top
We still doing our thing
We still raining supreme
That's why everywhere we go they're yelling Kottonmout Kings

Yo
Whoever thought these rowdy whities from the Southern California, Orange County
Would still be pushin and poundin

Our beats in the streets and smokin fifteen years later
Some say it's an incredible beat like the rebound of the lakers
So I'm here to thank the people who that it all possible
The kings and queens close to the crew that's out on the road
My homies at the noize in the warehouse shipping stage
Johnny Richter I'm ya boy, and these colors never change

D-Loc back again
Blaze the weed you can ask a friend
Load a bowl, burn the head
Let the games begin so here we go
Yeah, Yeah on the road
Place blow, Kottonmouth killin shows
Fuck the hoes, 13 we still in a row
Killin the flow
Killin the show</pre>
