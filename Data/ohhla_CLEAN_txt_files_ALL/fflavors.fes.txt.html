[Hook 2X: Fes Taylor]
It's Future Flavors online
It go mic check, 1718, now coming on time

[Fes Taylor]
Fes Taylor, the only one who staying holding it down
Watch homey run, I'm airing a pound, they fearing my town
Staten Island, we back, I put holes in your knee cap
Bullet go right where the crease at
The streets where I feast at, shit and I sleep at
It's Wolf Pack, what up Dub, you know you can peace that
I spark blunts, with Emilio, I'm gangsta, really though
I step inside the booth with a Philly roll
Three way on the Nextel, Gil holla at DJ Excel, tell him the check's mailed
I'm the best, well, guess you can test
And just feel, MC's can't touch me like the third rail
With show's with Tufflon, L.I.S., and S.I.C.
Security, rock, this nigga right here popping shit
Listen son, this is Two 4 War, Park Hill Day
Like Meth said "Put that nigga jaw to the floor"
Profes, you know I'm guilty in the court of the law
Warriorz running streets from the south to the north shore

[Chorus 2X: Fes Taylor]
I'm the Future, you know I got Flavor, Shaolin, I'mma save ya
Independent, no favors for majors
I'm the Future, you know I got Flavor, and I won't disgrace ya
All you rappers, yeah, I'm here to replace ya</pre>
