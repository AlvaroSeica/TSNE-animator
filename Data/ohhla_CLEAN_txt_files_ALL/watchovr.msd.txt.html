Every day I wake I feel like crying
Every second I feel like praying
Every where I turn my prople dying
Brothers and sisters now listen what I'm saying

I don't really feel like writing
And I don't really feel like singing
Coz everywhere I look my people fighting
And It's out own that we're killing

The same gunmen that cry 'bout suppresion
Of the white man and he's racist oppression
Go a church and give God he's confesion
Gun in his pocket and crack in his possession

Damn hypocrite don't be disillusioned
Yeah life is tough but that's not no solution
You g'wan like ya brave
That's an illusion
Brave man wouldn't kill his own
Would start a revolution

Gunamn and too much drug man
What are we showing the yours dem?
We should be protecting
Instead we're destroying
Oh Father,
Watch over them</pre>
