(Intro)
Yo breddren, you look so fucked up
You look so fuck up breddren
Yo g, I've been bleaching for days
Haven't slept, haven't eaten, know what I mean
I'm just trying to make this money you know what I mean
People at home have to eat rude boy, straight up

(Jugganot)
Yo, after midnight, nigga's don't want to been seen in the streetlight
The street life is toxic to your body and the heat might
Cause a nigga that you always thought would be tight
To ROB you cause you made too much money last night
When it gets dark outside, nigga's get dark inside
And when stressed, some how well put one in your moms chest
But lets not forget the five-o
cause if your heart says no tell the rock head to blow
Cause they will smoke that shit to make the charge stick
Half of them smoke shit anyway
All y'all nightshift nigga's know who I'm talking about
The shady figures strangling nigga's and yelling, Spit it out
(Get on the fucking floor)
The heats so high you have to chip it out
Rap it individually and keep it in your mouth
But we still poor and we still survive
And we still chop non-stop until the sunrise
G home get something to eat, take a load off my feet
I'll probably only get four hour's sleep
Cause my phone only chooses to blow up when I'm tired as fuck
Now they got me asking myself, what's worth more my health or the money?
Asking myself these things as I go to chop my rusty
My mom says I'm gonna die quick if I don't stop selling shit
But every time that I try to quit
I have visions of my moms eating dog food and shit
Yo, on the nightshiftnightshift
Its not happening, huh, straight up

Chorus (x 2)
Yo on the nightshift, its just you against the cops
A war over rock, the battleground is your block
On the nightshift, you'll see evil at its purest
Make money, stay low, and never touch the surface

(Jugganot)
Up on the nightshift, smoking my spliff, flaunting my gift
You got to be swift, your lack of reflexes is gonna get your wig twist back
Were not the only ones to walk with gats
Its just that, were busting after the first word
You're waiting for the fourth word
We kill nigga's, I know you heard
But you're afraid to admit the fact that you're weaker
I'm like a walk-in sound, you're like a jail radio speaker
I'm an Erikson phone, you're just a cash money beeper
See the comparison, there is none
You walk with knifes, I walk with big guns
Kidnap your son and kill him after I collect the ransom
Its not done, I kick you in your throat
make you choke on your own tongue, it's job done
All you hear is BROM, BROM, cause when we bust, we bust more than one
Even if you got your vest on, you can't regard this
We do dirt and beat the charges, my nigga's try they hardest
To harness, the quality to make us the largest
Enemy and nemesis you dealt with
Your compulsion to talk shit will be the death of your click
We make money, legally or illegally
But feasibly, it's all economically
Fool proof security 100% criminal quality
Means no apology, my philosophy is thug technology
Cripped out wallabies, I try to leave but the streets keep calling me
Some times I feel they trying to swallow me
Don't follow me, cause I wont lead you and don't need you
But if you're willing to die for my cause I'm gonna feed you
I'm too big to be eaten, to quick to kill to be beaten
DGK's defeated any enemy for any reason
Scholastic movements leave a small margin for improvement
Crip nigga's prove shit, remorseless and ruthless
Friending me up is useless, actually
You make it easier for me to take you and your family
I'm taking you for three out of the six in a diss
On the nightshift, know this (nightshift, nightshift)

Chorus (x 2)

Make money, make money, make money</pre>
