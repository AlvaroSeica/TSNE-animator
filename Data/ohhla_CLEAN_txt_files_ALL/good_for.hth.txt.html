[Intro]
I'm no good, yes I'm no good
Let me tell you, no good, girl I'm no good
I'm no good for nothing

[Suffa]
Get 'em P!

[Pressure]
Problematic child from a God abandoned isle
where Hip Hop is like a convict on a standing trial
Dropping havoc, I'll rock the planet wild
till they shoot me in a movie, Hong Kong combatant style
Plastic wrapping/rapping and disposable culture
Poet or soldier, falter and get throw to the vultures
We wear our scars like a badge of honour sewn in the shoulder
Cross the unknown, rock alone like the coast of Gibraltar
Looking over my shoulder, radio and payola
keep us alien on air like being flown by Travolta
Flow with a vocal assault of the microphone and controller
Harder to handle than a loaded revolver coated with sulphur
You in a house made of glass throwing a boulder
But never see the light of day like car motors on solar
Going for broke don't mean you're going broke for the culture
We'd hang ourselves given rope and pergola

[Chorus 2X] - (Suffa) - {Pressure}
I'm no good, yes I'm no good
Let me tell you, no good, girl I'm no good
I'm no good for nothing
(And I might be no good, but when I seize the mic
 I can spit it like), "Jesus Christ"
I'm no good, yes I'm no good
Let me tell you, no good, girl I'm no good
I'm no good for nothing
{And I might be no good, but when I seize the mic
 I can spit it like}, "Jesus Christ"

[Suffa]
Beast of burden, carry the weight
I got divorced from reality, then married a break
in a bally and cape, I get carried away
like a cadaver on a battlefield, make barriers break
Man my chariot waits, I can't stay for the gala
Music is dead, fame's alive, Lady Gaga
They complain about the drama
Go play the martyr role better than Mohamed Atta
Suffa, grimy as Calcutta
Beat you single-handed like Def Leppard's drummer
I'm a-bout to blow like meth on the cooker
Leaving me with the mic's like leaving pets with a butcher
Don't put a foot wrong, think for a good long minute
(Shut your mouth) put a foot-long in it
You're dealing with one of the best to bust so
Tyler Durden, don't beat yourself up bro

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
