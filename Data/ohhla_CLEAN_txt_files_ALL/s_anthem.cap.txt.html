[Fingazz (Mr. Capone-E in background)]
Nothin' like the summertime
Baby
Homies in the park goin'
Crazy
Cruisin' down the block with ya
Lady
In the
In the
In the sunshine (Oh!)

Chorus: Fingazz
Kickin' back to the summertime anthem
Cruisin' in ya ride to the summertime anthem
I know you feelin' that summertime anthem
So get down to the summertime anthem
Summertime (Yeah)
Summertime (Yeah)
Summertime (Yeah)
I know you feelin' it
Yeah, yeah

[Mr. Capone-E]
(Verse 1)
It's summertime, and I feelin' so good
Wake up in the morning with the player's groove
The weather is hot, and I'm in my drop top
Family and friends rolling through the parking lot
Today's a good day, so call up the DJ {*Fingazz scratching*}
Bring the Gatorade
It's a sunny day
By the way, I'm so fresh and so clean
Out of the sunshine, you know what I mean
And not to find no stress, and so it's time to chill
A moment of real action with a meat on the grill
And for real {*wolf whistle*}
The girl's lookin' so fine
Dressed to impressed, and the weather's 89
All the time
The homies bring the cars out
Black, white, brown, Asians, no doubt {*lowrider*}
It's a holiday
It's a sunny day
Summertime anthem, sing along
Hey

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 2)
It's still hot
As we reach the mid-day
Water balloon fights
And the kids play
Another day in the summer sunshine
Kites in the air, as the food gets prepared
All the fellas lookin' for the pretty girls
The pretty, pretty girls out in the summer world
Like DJ Jazzy Jeff
And Fresh Prince
It's Summertime again, let's reminisce
And how summer comes and goes, and comes again
School's out, let's all have some fun again
Everyone with their ringtones blowing up
It's the summer anthem song, so you know what's up
Play it loud in the park, cruisin' in your ride
Everybody enjoy life, these are the good times
Nevermind your problems, they go ahead
It's summertime, everyday is a good day

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 3)
Now it's 6 o'clock and it's feelin' so good
Summer breeze spreadin' throughout the neighborhood
Time to pack up the bags, and to roll on out
Jumped in the vehicles with the music playing loud
Boastin'
Like it was '94
Remember Whittier Boulevard after the car show (Sho!)
Dammit
Those were the good old days
But the summertime's back, and it's time to play

Bridge: Fingazz
Nothin' like the summertime
Baby
Homies in the park goin'
Crazy
Cruisin' down the block with ya
Lady
In the
In the
In the sunshine
Nothin' like the summertime
Baby
Girls lookin' hot, they a-
Maze up
I'm so fresh, so clean, so they praise me
In the
In the
In the summertime

Repeat Chorus
