[Intro]
Smoke dawg baby, remember that shit

[Tyga]
Young light skinned, born ??
Since I was 10 prolly name all the trouble I did
Neva participated I'm like fuck all them other kids
Like I don't owe you child shit when I make it big
But a little respect, ??
Never raised a gentlemen like Ne-Yo said
Lookin for hero heads, but I don't see none yet
All my friends weenin cigarette so I take a hit
(cough cough)
That's some potent shit
Ol' nigga police man, I ain't scared a shit
But hell yeah I ran
Lost my money clip ever since wrap rubberbands
Biggity bam ?? skin made a couple of grands
Fast forward to the 4th escort I ball ??
Too quick 14 no license, that's some mar full shit
Now must stack ketchup like condenments
Kinda jss wish you taught me how to be a man. cuhs

[Chorus]
Growin up all I wanted was a father figure
Me &amp; mom alone every dinner
One day I hope you hear this I pray you doin better
This what it sound like if I sent my dad letters
If I sent my dad letters
This what it sound like if I sent my dad letters
One day I hope you hear this I pray you doin better
This what it sound like if I sent my dad a letter

[Tyga]
Word is, 10th grade kick out the crib
Like where I go from here, lucky I had a girlfriend
Remember money make the world spin
Runnin around the big body benz wonderin who in this thats pedestrian
Spoiled kid, never that
Worked to hard to get where I'm at
Think of fuck school, but next semester I be back
I hated rules, but ?? often dream of that
Dream of meetin you dad
Moms really getting mad when I call you that
I don't understand
Your phone numbers all I ask
She laughs with her jaw dropped like the movie mask
Damn so I then reply resort to raising my own little man
But I'm too young for that, wait I take that back
I shoulda used the hat. my girl gettin fat
Whatever results make sure that, I'll be there like you wasn't dad

[Chorus]
Growin up all I wanted was a father figure
Me &amp; mom alone every dinner
One day I hope you hear this I pray you doin better
This what it sound like if I sent my dad letters
If I sent my dad letters
This what it sound like if I sent my dad letters
One day I hope you hear this I pray you doin better
This what it sound like if I sent my dad a letter

[Tyga]
Double 09 lately its been on my mind
The pain eatin me alive one verse at a time
And this heart problem ain't helpin at all
Its a cardiac diagnose, just wanna stay at home
Dyin slow so I bought a fast car, and a couple of charms
Now family and old friends wanna be involved
Some nigga tryna marry mom he like my songs
I find it odd sometimes wanna fucking shoot his head off
Am in the wrong, didn't think so movin on
Im working on my new album if you singing songs
But rap is what I does
Turnin 20 soon, then 21 then 22 like ?? was
Everybody sleeepin on me time to wake em upp
Now everybody chasinn us like they missed the bus
&amp; girls wanna roll like a blunt
P.S. your only son

[Chorus]
Growin up all I wanted was a father figure
Me &amp; mom alone every dinner
One day I hope you hear this I pray you doin better
This what it sound like if I sent my dad letters
If I sent my dad letters
This what it sound like if I sent my dad letters
One day I hope you hear this I pray you doin better
This what it sound like if I sent my dad a letter</pre>
