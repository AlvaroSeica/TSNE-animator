[Chorus: Nathan Williams]
Shoes for runnin', and I'll race ya
Sun is comin', it'll chase ya
Through this dead beat town
Through this dead beat town
The end is comin', I will race you
But there's no runnin', it'll chase ya
Death will hunt you down
Death will hunt you down

[Big Boi]
What about the people that's barefoot
with no shoes for running when the sun come up?
Hey, one percenters, the ninety-nine say what you gonna do for us?
We'll run up in your house like the first runner up
Be the first one to buck and the last one to get laid down, stay down
And now we're looking at the top of the pile
Or the king of the mountain gonna knock him off
Revolt, but y'all niggas here too soft
Bubblegum, just poppin' off
At the mouth like the nigga got all the hoes
Got all the dough and all the women
Boy, what you goin' do in the penitentiary?
Got a lot of money, can't take it with me
I can't take it with me, I wish they could send me
to the moon and back with a cure for cancer
And save the lives of my great grandmama and my great grandaddy
Now that's the answer to the question
but they make money off the medicine
Leaving us all stuck in elections
with no progressions, just recessions

[Chorus: Nathan Williams]
Shoes for runnin', and I'll race ya
Sun is comin', it'll chase ya
Through this dead beat town
Through this dead beat town
The end is coming, I will race you
But there's no runnin', it'll chase ya
Death will hunt you down
Death will hunt you down

[B.o.B]
Yo!
Just as I expected, life gets deadly
It's funny how the beloved become the beheaded
The truth can be independent or the direction that you stretch it
So my niggas will draw when shit gets sketchy
That's a masterpiece, a work of art
A gallery, no photoshop
Pictures say a million words, so I just let my photos talk
Even in your local talk, niggas say you know he boss
Everytime my name is brought up better know it's mogul talk (It's mogul talk!)
That's why she give me geek 'till her shins weak
I'm blazin' everyday, you can call that demp week
You're runnin' from your life that you didn't see
That's like playing' hide and seek with the Grim Reap

[Chorus: Nathan Williams]
Shoes for runnin', and I'll race ya
Sun is comin', it'll chase ya
Through this dead beat town
Through this dead beat town
The end is comin', I will race you
But there's no runnin', it'll chase ya
Death will hunt you down
Death will hunt you down

[Big Boi]
You can run, but you can't hide
Spent your whole life trying to escape
When everybody stayed
Getting tired of livin' in a lie
Different nights, same town
Say goodbyes, but we tried
Cause we know there's no gettin' out
And when the pawns are playin' themselves
I just lay and wait and straighten myself
Let 'em blow it out to the rhythm sells out
Bring them back to life, give them mouth to mouth

[Chorus: Children]
Shoes for runnin', and I'll race ya
Sun is comin', it'll chase ya
Through this dead beat town
Through this dead beat town
The end is comin', I will race you
But there's no runnin', it'll chase ya
Death will hunt you down
Death will hunt you down

[B.o.B] (Repeat 2x)
You can fight and try to get away
but there's no way to run and hide to
You better know that there will come a day
Eventually, it's goin' find you 

[B.o.B]
Eventually, it's goin' find you
Find you
It's goin' find you
And it's goin', yeah, eventually, it's goin' find you
And it's goin' find you; it's goin' to find you
Yo!</pre>
