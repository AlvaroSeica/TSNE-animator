Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Hey! Ah-ha
Hey! Yah-ha
Hey! It's Ke$ha!
Let's do it

The lights are off
It's time to play
Got work to do
But that can wait

I wanna let go
Let everyone know
That fuck it
I don't care

Been spending too
Much energy
On stupid shit
When honestly

I wanna get high
Just wanna get high
With everyone else here

Baby, all that matters
Is the beautiful life
Yeah, is the beautiful life
Yeah, is the beautiful life

Baby, all that matters
Is the beautiful life
Yeah, is the beautiful life
Yeah, is the beautiful life

Baby, all that matters
Is the beautiful life
Yeah, is the beautiful life
Yeah, is the beautiful life

Baby, all that matters
Is the beautiful life
Yeah, is the beautiful life
Yeah, is the beautiful life

We're made in stars
We're up in space
Now in the dark
Come kiss my face

We're swimming in gold
We're swimming in gold
Like fuck it
We don't care

Yeah, this just got sick
Before my eyes
We'll stay up here
Till the end of time

I feel so alive
I'm losing my mind
Like everyone else here

Baby, all that matters
Is the beautiful life
Yeah, is the beautiful life
(Oh-oh woah-oh-oh), yeah
Is the beautiful life

Baby, all that matters
Is the beautiful life
Yeah, is the beautiful life
(Oh yeah), yeah
Is the beautiful life

Baby, all that matters
Is the beautiful life
Yeah, is the beautiful life
Yeah, is the beautiful life

Baby, all that matters
Is the beautiful life
Yeah, is the beautiful life
Yeah, is the beautiful life

Yeah, uh, it's raining down
Been up all night
There's no excuses
We kiss the sky

Don't wanna come down
Don't wanna come down
Is anyone out there?
Baby, all that matters

Put your motherfuckin' phones up
Light 'em up, oh yeah
Put your motherfuckin' phones up
Light 'em up

Baby, all that matters
Is the beautiful life
Yeah, is the beautiful life
(Oh-oh woah-oh-oh), yeah
Is the beautiful life

Baby, all that matters
Is the beautiful life
Yeah, is the beautiful life
(Oh-oh-oh), yeah
Is the beautiful life

(Yeah), baby, all that matters
Is the beautiful life
Yeah, is the beautiful life
Yeah, is the beautiful life

Baby, all that matters
Is the beautiful life
Yeah, is the beautiful life
Yeah, is the beautiful life

Baby, all that matters</pre>
