("There is no time, to say what I feel")

[No Malice]
It's kinda hard to articulate
I guess I'm in a different place
Different space, different time
I reason with a different mind
What I'm sayin is the things that I once loved
I now find myself ashamed of
In the game we done came up
But we ain't all had the same luck
Some of us, heard the gavel slam
With all that snow came an avalanche
Did we ever really stand a chance?
Well now it's out of our hands
Mercy; your little man, 3rd grade
Little league, 1st place
Proms, birthdays
We miss you in the worst way

("There is no time, to say what I feel")

[Jaeson Ma]
There's no time...
But I have to say what's inside of my heart
The most valuable asset we have is time
How do we use our time?
All we have is right now
All we have is this moments
I don't wanna have regrets
I don't wanna die thinking about what I shouldâve done
But it's never too late, for our God is a god of second chances

("There is no time, to say what I feel")

[No Malice]
The things I call regrets
are the things that made me my best
He made a message out of my mess
So now my heart is a under arrest
I confess I was, misguided, misled
No laws, I'm runnin the red
Roulette, gun in my head
You don't have to die to already be dead!
..Think twice
Life or death, choose LIFE
Some things are elementary
Sometimes we create our own misery
But no penalty, you can let it go
He gave me a voice when I shoulda been an echo, echo, echo...

("There is no time, to say what I feel")

[Jaeson Ma]
I hear you...
This voice crying out in the wilderness...
I don't care what you done: abortion, adultery, murder?
There is no condemnation!
You need to know this: there IS a redeemer
Have you tried everything?
Are you the same place you were in last year?
At this time, then read the signs
Don't just +Watch the Throne+, pay homage to it!

("There is no time, to say what I feel")

[Jaeson Ma]
You only have this moment...  Listen...
Don't be mistaken
One who has unreliable friends soon comes to ruin
But there is a friend who sticks closer than a brother
We've all, at some point in time, been a friend with this world
We've all had the conversation with the old man
We all shook hands with the devil.. and had fun doing it
But when is enough enough? Are you getting nowhere fast?
Take a look in yourself, is this the real you?
Is this who you wanna be?
"For I know the plans I have for you," declares The Lord
"Plans to prosper you and not to harm you
 Plans to give you hope and a future"</pre>
