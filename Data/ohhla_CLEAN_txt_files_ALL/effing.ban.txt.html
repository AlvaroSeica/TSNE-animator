[Intro: Jazze Pha]
Woo~! Ohhh, she look so beautiful, don't you agree?
Girl, you know what I think you should do right now?
You should just take off all of your clothes
Every article, of clothing.. 
except for the.. leave the pumps on, girl! I like that
Enough of the kissin and huggin

[Chorus: Jazze Pha]
We should be FUCKINNNN - on the bed, on the couch now
FUCKIN, FUCKIN, FUCKINNNNN - on the fur to the living room
We should be FUCKINNNN - on the bed, on the couch now
FUCKIN, FUCKIN, FUCKINNNNN - on the fur to the living room
We should be..

[David Banner]
Let them boys make love, let me fuck you from the back
Hair pullin, hot wax, they won't do it like that
They can't do it like this, they won't tie you by your wrist
and spank ya lil' sexy bad ass, come quick
Yea, I know you're hard at work
Yea, I know your boss a jerk
You can come to the flat, I tie you up with youur skirt
Let your man make love, let me bring you to the crib
You a big city girl, let me show you where I live
Got a pond in the front, got a lake in the back
If you wanna pop the trunk, we can do it in the 'Lac
Got a dick like a horse, let me see you take that

[Chorus]

[David Banner]
Girl, g'on lose ya mind, let my dick touch ya spine
Cum four or five times, Southside bump 'n' grind
Young ladies stand in line, but I wanna fuck you
And all your freaky dreams, I wanna make 'em come true
Like fuckin on the back porch, g'on let it out
or we can fuck in Times Square, I'll make ya scream, "Dirty South!"
Damn, I ain't tryna run game
But I will make you scream my name - (David Banner)
Geah, my G5 just an airplane
Pick it how you want it girl, pleasure or pain (Heeey!)
Yeah, cause you're dealin with a mack now
Go and tell ya friends that I blew ya back out

[Chorus]

[Jazze Pha]
When ya step into the crib
Get in ya birthday suit, GIRL leave on ya heels
..and get it ready for daddy
I guarantee your satisfaction, I hope you're ready for action
I'm in the mood, baby.. Oh yeaaaah
Forget, ya nigga, it's Banner and Phizzle
Put ya back into it - when I work, the middle
(Make it hurt, a little) When I hit it from the back, girl

[Chorus]</pre>
