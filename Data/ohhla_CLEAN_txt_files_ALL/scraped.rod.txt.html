Typed by: Cno Evil

[Intro: Li-Mouse (Cno Evil) {Knickolist Knowledge}]
This is hip hop, get your shit rocked, I'm in tip top
Shape, when it comes to this, you get scraped
I'm hearing songs that sound like some recipes
That's alright, I'm the spice, you can't mess with me
(That's amazing, my innovation is persuasion
I love this beat, just like Mouse loves an Asian
It's over done, finito, when you fuck with Cno Evil)
{Let him do what he do, and roll with the new}

[Knickolist Knowledge]
Saint Knickolist, with the verbal gift, blessing with the hits
Time to spit, hit him with the lyrics, the scientific
The flow is splendid and terrific
But cross the line and shit'll get horrific, but flip it
Time to finish shit, the bullshit you try to start, we end it
Move on to big and better things, higher level, heavy metal
Golden like Sonic rings that blink, we split tangoing
Materialize the dream and get creamed, so what, you bring
I just blow it off like steam, indestructible
Untouchable, flow combustible, mighty crew
Rushing crew, rushing through, coming through
Spit a few and drop jewels...

[Chorus 2X: Li-Mouse]
Hip hop, get your shit rocked, I'm in tip top
Shape, when it comes to this, you get scraped

[Li-Mouse]
Bitter muthafuckas need school, culinary
Check your breathing, I affect your pulmonary, and
Other spots in your anatomy
The way I spit chaotic, leads to tragedy
Your limbs and weak and every, time I start speaking
Then you panic, more than New Orleans when shit starts leaking
I'm sick, disease, poison, I spit venom
I don't rules, like pipes in Meineke, I bend them

[Cno Evil]
This the miracle on ice, and nope, it's not hockey
This the digital device, and nope, it's not Bobby
Here's some spiritual advice, Cno Evil's nice
Mouse brought the speakers and Knowledge brings the mic
He's...

[Li-Mouse]
M-O-U, fuck that, you know who
S-E, destroy you for free or fee
How we, get cheese, and you'll agree
Then you flee, yeah, man, nigga please

[Cno Evil]
Knowledge, New York Knick, your shit is sick
This is Cno E., straight from W.P.

[Chorus 3X]</pre>
