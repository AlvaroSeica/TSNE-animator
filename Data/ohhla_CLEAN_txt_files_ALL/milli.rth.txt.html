Song:   A Milli 
Typed by: jaysscholar@gmail.com

A million here, a million there
Yeah you got a mil but for real dog, nobody cares
If you don't share, don't donate to charity
Children who can barely eat, no shoes on their feet
We don't see, we don't read, we don't really need to
Self-centered humans be the root of all evil
In this industry, we just feed our egos
Got a seven series and a brand new peacoat
With that "Oh, Oh, look at me yo.
Heard that Asho Milli, he ain't talking about me though"
Yes I am, yo you call yourself a man
But it ain't about the money, it's about what you stand for
This is for my people who can't afford pampers
Wake up in the morning got my clothes out the hamper
Money ain't the answer, still ain't cured cancer
I ain't got a mill but I'm a pretty good dancer
My advance lasted me about a week
After taxes, my bills and a big sack of weed
I am back to where I began, chilling watching CNN
Thinking damn, we are damned, not again
How is George Bush not in jail for treason
But Clinton gets impeached for busting semen
A million dead, a million scared
A million bars so you realize you took it to far
With your cars and your guns, ha, hardy har har
Till I'm dead and I'm gone I'm a party too hard
Life's short have a ball, matter fact have two
Yo,the government don't care, here's a big fuck you
Cuz gas is four bucks but they still drive trucks
Dumb &amp; Dumber in your Hummer, yo I bet that sucks
Spend a milli at the pump, in the city you don't need that
Buy a fucking bike maybe you wouldn't be fat
Ha, Yo homie where the weed at
Yeah I need to relax, motherfucker I'm chill

It's just these stupid motherfuckers never get it, it's pathetic
Yo, they get to the pros and don't do shit like they Reddick
When I get that chedick (check) I'm a take it straight to the medics
Cuz these sick kids need it more than I need a necklace
Y'all need to respect this
I'm Asher Paul Roth, yo I'm always on the guestlist
Yeah I got a checklist, stay getting checked bitch
Keep your mouth closed don't let yourself get checked bitch
Rap's Wayne Gretzky, yes I'm the best and
Only 22 more like Alex Ovechkin
I suggest y'all invest in some self-
esteem, intervene with Charlston Heston's
Plan to arm every man with a handgun
Who kills people: the gun or the man? um,
I'm the best sword fighter in the land, come test me
I'll be drinking wine while practicing my fencing
And drive a jet-ski, straight multi-tasking
How are you so good? I don't know, don't ask me
A million here, a million there
Yeah you got a mil but for real dog, nobody cares
If you don't share, you don't donate to charity
Children who can barely eat, no shoes on their feet
We don't see, we don't read, we don't really need to
Self-centered humans be the root of all evil
Motherfucker I'm ill</pre>
