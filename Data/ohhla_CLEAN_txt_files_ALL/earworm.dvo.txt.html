[Devo Spice]
I get up Friday mornin and I'm singin a song
But realize to my surprise there's somethin seriously wrong
Cause my brain does a loop, when it gets to the end
I hear a verse, then a chorus, then it starts right up again
I sing it in the shower and then when I dry my hair
I look sexy when I sing it in my worn out underwear
The song's still goin strong as I'm puttin on my new suit
At breakfast when I sang I nearly choked on a Fruit Loop
Finally it fades away as I prepare to leave
I breathe a sigh of relief, my brain is finally at ease
I get in my car, turn the key, and away we go
And guess what song is playin on the radio?
I get to work and I see my buddy Craig
But he backs away and looks at me as if I've got the plague
Cause I'm singin out loud "I'm the dancing queen"!
Young and sweet, only seventeen

[Chorus]
Oompa loompa doopity doo (make it stop!)
I'm going to do something awful to you (make it stop!)
Oompa loompa doopity dee (dear God make it stop!)
Because of what this song is doing to me
Oompa loompa doopity doo (it's still going!)
This song will never stop bothering you (please help)
Oompa loompa doopity dee (I can't take it)
You'll be singing this for all eternity

[Devo Spice]
Noo-ho-hooooo

[MC Lars]
Don't get me wrong, yo, I love a catchy song
But some tracks are real annoying when they make you sing along
Malicious songwriters know it's mind control
Spending publishing advances while it's voodoo on your soul
Maybe Katy Perry's very scary there she goes again sincerely
making everybody wary of dark magic that she carries
This teenage dream is in fact a teenage nightmare
Bruno Mars singin bars in your head for like nine years~!
Unless you hang a pentagram, sacrifice a Bieber fan
Major labels doin damage, save yourself and even then
Every song you've ever loved, every ad you've ever heard
Earworm's all up in your brain, doing damage it's absurd
Indie bands too, these pop charts are no liars
It's a vampire weekend, the arcade is on fire
Demonic pentatonic I'm on it I want it out
Calculated melodies, something I can do without
Devo Spice and MC Lars, we so nice we underground
Workin on a clever sound, better rhymes are never found
I said it before, and I'll say it again
The mainstream is whack, thank God he and I are friends (like)

[Chorus]

[Devo Spice]
Will someone please explain why my brain tends to crash
and repeat the same refrain like a record with a scratch?
Thankfully it's just me who gets to hear the song's persistence
Otherwise ASCAP would likely sue me out of existence
It's called an Earworm when the song goes on and on
Because it burrows into your brain like +The Wrath of Kahn+
Even songs that you enjoy become annoying over time
I've even started to hate a few songs of mine!
(Yeah me too) What? (Um never mind dude) Anyway
I'm still hummin that same dumb song from yesterday
I wanna cry - will someone please explain to me why
I'm singin Jingle Bell Rock through the middle of July?
So now I'm getting desperate, this is drivin me insane
It's like the song is trying to burrow a hole into my brain
I've got to get it out before my cerebellum warps
So now my only recourse, is Cannibal Corpse

Kill the freakin Oompa Loompas, DIEEEEEE!
Ahh, that is SO much better</pre>
