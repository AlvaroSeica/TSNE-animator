[Chamillionaire]
Here we go again
That's liiiife
Ooh, ooh, ooh, alright
Can't you see that it's rainin? (hol' up)
Can't you see that it's pourin?
They just wanna see rainfall (hol' up)
They just hope that it's stormin
They, always gonna tell you when it rains it pours
Mother Nature's playin her part, c'mon
I don't have a lot of time to tell you this
But this is where we gon' start, hol' up

Teenager from the north side of town
It was a rainy day in Houston now, wasn't no hoopers out
Just people that would loot your house
In a city where they used to smile, you could lose your child
Think back when I heard a rap
I would listen to the words of Chad
and Bun B, "Have you heard of that?" is what I heard 'em ask
I never ever heard 'em laugh
Uncle Ro was a street cat
He was down with a Chi-Town producer named Hurt-M-Badd
He did "Hail Mary" for 2Pac
When he spoke everybody listened to him like you heard the man
I met them out of Rap-A-Lot, I was droppin off my partner Crime
And I was really young at the time
I wasn't even 'sposed to be there
He asked me to come with him cause he knew that I could rap some lines
No problem, on the way drivin
Everybody else workin on they day job and
Don't sell weight, no I ain't robbin
I'ma keep goin, told 'em that I ain't stoppin
Had rhymes I was tryin to bust (bust)
I guess I said somethin that was live enough (nough)
I had the type of vibe that these guys could trust
and one said "You should come out to the Chi with us" (uh)
Can't do, it took a little while to get cool
This relationship was brand new
But you know I had to
Fast forward three months later, where you think Cham flew?
Touched down in the windy place
Make a move to Chicago, work for survival
Vice Lords and Disciples
"Stay gangsta" was the motto, really what do I know?
Well I learned real quick how to not die (die)
Don't wear your ballcap to the wrong side (side)
Matter fact, you don't wanna get the wrong vibe
Don't wear the ballcap if you gon' ride
It's what he told me, and he was O.G.
And when I listened to him I had did it closely
It was cold so he brought me a Coogi
And matter fact he never told me "You owe me"
Think about it that was cool as hell (hell)
And I was tryin to rap, tryin to do it well (well)
He had that type of hustle that included scales
The type of hustle that could put a dude in jail
I slept on his couch, I'd say my prayer
Like, "Why the hell did I move way out here?
How did I get this great idea?"
Three months later I'll disappea...
