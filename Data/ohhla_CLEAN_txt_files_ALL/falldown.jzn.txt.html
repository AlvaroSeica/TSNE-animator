[Chief Chinchilla]
We all.. fall.. down

Drankin that Fall Down Brew
Hoe, let me fall down on you
Fall into my lap, then take a nap
Then call your sister she can fall down too

[R.A. the Rugged Man]
Oh yeah drink it drink it drink it (drink it) fat bitch swig it
Let's kick it, get on your knees lick it lick it lick it lick it
The Fall Down Brew, chug it, don't swig it, once you pass out
The titties gettin sucked your pussy gettin fingered
Born to get laid drink it the Fall Down (down)
Bitches think I'm attractive and wanna fuck me once they drink it all down
Pour some on my dick and use it as a prophylactic
Pour some on your pussy watch your pussy do a backflip
Catch my dick, it can please ya nice
I dick the Fall Down Brew and stick my dick in Condaleeza Rice
I raped Dick Cheney with a shotgun
Sewed Hillary Clinton's meadow, and that's after drinkin just one
The Fall Down

[J-Zone] Damn baby where you goin?
[ChiefC] She drinkin that Fall Down malt liquor again

"I fell down a flight of stairs man"</pre>
