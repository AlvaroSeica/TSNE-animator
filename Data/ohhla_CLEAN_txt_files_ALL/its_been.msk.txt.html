Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
Its been a long long time
Since I wanted to hold hold you close
And I long just to
Hold you close hold you close
Its been a long long time
And ooh its been a long

[Krazie]
Its been a long time since I seen you last
Still remember firme memories from our past
And I cant help but think what I must of been to you
And why I had to trip in the first place
All up in your face didn't care about your sentimientos
And thats one of the razones why you went away
Couldn't bare to stay and so you had your way
And now I'm slowly dying every night and dia I think about you
What am I to do when you cross my path no longer be sad
Hold you close and never let you go this time
Ill be tu mera mera pandillera en la loquera no me perdere
Te prometo serte fiel y esta vez no jugare
Contigo y siempre te amare entonces que dices
Baby you ain't gotta think this
I'm your one and only never lonely babydoll
So when you think of me give me a call
Let me know its been a long time
And you been so down without me
Lets me up somewhere what time when and where
Let me know mi vida and I'll be there

[Chorus]
Its been a long long time
Since I wanted to hold hold you close
And I long just to
Hold you close hold you close
Its been a long long time
And ooh its been a long

[Krazie]
I remember when we parted ways
Were the saddest days of my life
I couldn't sleep I couldn't think
Todo el dia me la pasaba on that trip
Couldn't let it go so easily
Baby te juro time hasn't done nada
I stay awake and wide awake I dream of you
Mijo porque what I feel is true
And what I felt back then serio
I still feel it right now
I want you to know I want you around I need you around
Baby no doubt your what I need now
Lets make it all better you know whats the matte
I miss you un chingo y enserio te digo
Que quiero que vuelvas mirarte a los ojos
Decirtelo todo porque yo te adoro simon</pre>
