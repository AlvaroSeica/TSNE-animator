"Top Notch..."

[Chorus]
Shorty said she was gon' work it on you (yeah)
She did a little twerk and she flirtin on you (yeah)
She's headed to the dance floor, now it's on you (yeah)
She's stayin all night, and she waitin on you (uhh)
So what you gon' do? (Huh?) What you gon' do? (Huh?)
So what you gon' do? (Huh?) What you gon' do? (Huh?)
So what you gon' do? (Huh?) What you gon' do? (Huh?)
So what you gon' do? (Huh?) What you gon' do? Huh?

[Cassidy]
Yeah, I do it big, I be puffin the bud
And e'ry dutch is a dub, it's like a steam room up in the club
I drink from the bottle, I don't need a cup in the club
I drive the ladies crazy, I get nothin but love
Because, that's the type of nigga I be
But y'all money too small to do it bigger than me
Cause see, I be on some fly shit
My chain blue, bright like the light they be killin the flies with
I ain't tryin to commit to e'ry chick that I slide with
But if she a dime I'll make her my side chick
If she could ride dick and she willin to rock out
I'll VVS a link, pink rockin her watch out
And then, I'ma let her shop 'til she drop out
It might be considered trickin but nigga I'm guap'd out
I'm gettin cheddar, I'll give her a check
But I ain't givin her a penny 'til she give me some neck, yes

[Chorus]

[Cassidy]
Listen, I ain't a magician
But I could make the roof on the Vanguish vanish
Poof~! Dependin on the circumstances
I simply'll straight take penitentiary chances
But my plans is to change my whole life around
Say no to drugs, put the guns and the knife down
I'm with this lil' bitch right now
She remind me of Nicki Minaj, she's spittin on the mic now
Heh, she recordin her whole album on me
She 'bout to make me cum in her mouth then swallow on me
She started drinkin right out the Hennessy bottle on me
Then strip like a new model on me
If you want it then come and get it, if you want me to hit it
I'm wit it, let's get it done, if you want it then come and get it
You know if you want it it's nothin to come and visit
Mami let's get it done, if you want it then come and get it

[Chorus]

[Cassidy]
I'ma make it do what it do
Yeah, I'ma make it do what it do (what you gon' do?)
I'ma make it do what it do
Yeah, I'ma make it do what it do (what you gon' do?)
Cause my jeans brand new and my sneaks is too
Yeah, I'ma make it do what it do - I'm so clean!
If you with your girlfriend you could bring them too
Yeah, I'ma make it do what it do - ya mean?
