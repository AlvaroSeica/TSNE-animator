{Verse 2: Lil Ya}
Look yea, look yea...
Once upon a time in the heart of the three
There lived Tec, Ya &amp; Yella, you know U-N-L-V
Livin violent was the way of livin
And every telent show they entered man them boys was winnin, we been hot
Three niggaz representin that U-P-T
Hard hittin, go gettin, straight runnin the streets
Trend setters gettin chedder plus love from the hood
Keepin it real with my peeps, givin my bitches the wood
Niggaz be throwin they wards all you see is the 3
Even downtown through it up fa 6 and B
Each show cross the river all over the world
Gives it up fa them niggaz who keeps a pocket full of furl
