What's the place where you see more girls 
that you'd like to pick up, than any other place?

Honey was offended by the pick up line
Honey was offended by the pick up line
Honey was offended by the pick up line
Honey was offended by the pick up line

If I said you had a beautiful body would you hold it against me?
Can I buy you a drink?  Your glass is empty
What's a nice girl like you doing in a place like this?
Anyway, you come here often?  Is this seat taken miss?
America?  No?  Well you should be a model I'm
New in town so could you show me around?
Can I call you sometime?
I'd like to get to knowin
Your place or mine?  I love your eyes, hey where you goin?

Now, honey didn't do what everyone else does
She stood out without making a scene because she was
The hottest but the most modest in a long plaid skirt
And a shirt with a little picture of Ernie &amp; Bert
Now, she played no sports except scholastic sorts
An academic epidemic during book reports
The starlet of a play, not a harlot to lay
So all the school ??  mad that she wouldn't give it away
See,

[CHORUS 1]
Honey was offended by the pick up line
Honey was offended by the pick up line
When Joe the superhoe said, "Baby what's your sign?"
Honey was offended by the pick up line

Cut my bangs so they don't hang, then shampoo the doo
Get the hair out of my eye so I can look into
Of you master and capture the flag
In a '65 rag with brand new tags
She's for real, I feel *chills, they're multiplyin*
*it's so electrifyin, it's so electrifyin*
No denyin that I'm tryin to undress her
With that phony rap, you wouldn't even get near it
She wouldn't go for sugar-coated lyrics
So other girls would say, "She must be gay"
And call her a Lenny Dykstra
But soo what?  They really wanted to just like her
Jealous, I won't offend her, I'll treat her tender
Defend her and send her letters and such
But there's no rush and there's no
Baby you're so fine I wanna make you mine
Cuz honey simply ignored the pick-up line

[CHORUS 1]

[CHORUS 2]
Honey was offended by the pick up line
Honey was offended by the pick up line
There's no "Baby you're fine I wanna make you mine"
Cuz Honey was offended by the pick up line

Well excuse me (x4)

Y'all step up to this

Now the main dude who wooed women tried to make his move
On her, so we all watched to see what she would do
He moved in:  "Hey baby doll.. what's up with us?"
And honey was like, "Excuse me, but I'm gonna be late for my bus"
So I stepped up to her and said here's what I'm about
Long walks, deep thoughts, I I'd take you out, I won't
Play games or try to take the truth and bend it
I just wanna talk, and she wasn't offended

[CHORUS 1]

[CHORUS 2]

The pickup line, the pick up line
Honey was offended by the pick up line
Honey was offended by the pick up line
When the R&amp;B singer said let's bump n grind
Honey was offended by the pick up line</pre>
