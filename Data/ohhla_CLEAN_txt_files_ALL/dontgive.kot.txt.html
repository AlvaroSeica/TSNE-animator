Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Oh no we don't give a fuck
Oh no we don't give a fuck

We don't give fuck nah we don't give a fuck
Come into the spot, blowin shit up
Twistin up joints, dealin under cops?
We don't give fuck nah we don't give a fuck
We don't give a fuck like I told ya before
So gimme gimme gimme, gimme some more
We don't give a fuck, probably never will
We don't give a fuck, give a fuck fer real!

First off let me a say a lil something
My name is Daddy-X from the city of Compton
Just kiddin' I come from P-Town
Where the white boys nubb? And the chollo's get down
Back up man, I need room to breathe
My head is still spinnin from the beer and the weed!
It's just a everyday thing around these parts
Southern California like to party hard
Our very first gig was in someone's backyard
A huge keg party, shit was punk rock!
That's how we do it, we don't fuck around
We got paid in booze and bout a half a pound
(What)
I was happy I don't give a fuck
We all got wasted and I got my dick sucked
Here's the birth of an underground renegade
Decades later, I'm still gettin paid

We don't give fuck nah we don't give a fuck
Come into the spot, blowin shit up
Twistin up joints, dealin under cops?
We don't give fuck nah we don't give a fuck
We don't give a fuck like I told ya before
So gimme gimme gimme, gimme some more
We don't give a fuck, probably never will
We don't give a fuck, give a fuck fer real!

No I don't give a fuck man
Catch me blackin out on a plane on our way to Amsterdam
Guess I almost got arrested by the fuzz
cuz I took a couple pills and got a big buzz
We blaze big budds we does madd bottles
You wanna talk dirt bike, we always on the throttle
I stay madd faded, bein sober is under-rated
People seem to hate it cuz I'm always misbehavin
(Hey)
I don't give a fuck ya know D-Loc,
Middle fingaz up give a fuck lets go
Climb around when it's time to clown
gettin blown on the set just to let you know
Hold me down if I get outta line
ya never know what's gonna happen when I'm out my mind
I keep it easy and lay low but don't test ya luck

We don't give fuck nah we don't give a fuck
Come into the spot, blowin shit up
Twistin up joints, dealin under cops?
We don't give fuck nah we don't give a fuck
We don't give a fuck like I told ya before
So gimme gimme gimme, gimme some more
We don't give a fuck, probably never will
We don't give a fuck, give a fuck fer real!

I'm too sick about it
Fuck all the doubters
And fuck all the haters
I'm makin a stack of papers?
I'm into livin life
And I'm into gettin high
Those who try to bust my ballz
I gotta fuck you for all of yall

Fuck y'all
Daddy-X Johnny Rick D-Loc don't trip
Don't hate, relate the king klick
When we runnin a muck

Oh no we don't give a fuck
We don't give fuck nah we don't give a fuck
Come into the spot, blowin shit up
Twistin up joints, dealin under cops?
We don't give fuck nah we don't give a fuck
We don't give a fuck like I told ya before
So gimme gimme gimme, gimme some more
We don't give a fuck, probably never will
We don't give a fuck, give a fuck fer real!

Yep! Yep!
Never have, never will</pre>
