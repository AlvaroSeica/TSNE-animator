I ride for my niggas dawg, I ride for my niggas
I slide for my niggas dawg, I ride for my niggas dawg
Stay schemin'
Niggas tryna get at me (dawg)
I ride for my niggas
Stay schemin'
Niggas tryna get at me (dawg)
I ride for my niggas

[Rick Ross - Verse 1]
Damn, life so short, Fuck it, I don't wanna go to court
Fuck it, got a budget for the lawyer though
Fuck it, I'm on the run for the month
I'm in the bucket, paid 200 for it
My lil niggas thuggin', even got me paranoid
I'm getting money thats in any nigga category
Double M I got G's out in California

[Hook]

[Drake]
It bothers me when the Guards get to acting like the broads
Guess every team doesn't come complete with niggas like ours
Thats why I see no need to compete with niggas like y'all
I just ask them when you see me you speak up nigga thats all
Don't be ducking like you never wanted nothing
Its feeling like rap changed, there was a time it was rugged
Back when if a nigga reached it was for the weapon
Nowadays niggas reach just to sell they record
Spaghetti bolognese in Appolo lounge
Me and my G from DC thats how I roll around
Might look light, but we heavy though
You think Drake will pull some shit like that you never know
Million dollar meetings in appollo lounge
Me and my man all Oliver North thats how I roll around
Shawty wanna tell me secrets 'bout a rap nigga
I tell a bitch its more attractive when you hold it down
Kobe 'bout to lose a hundred fifty M's
Kobe my nigga I hate it, had to be him
Bitch you wasn't with me shooting in the gym
[Rick Ross] (Bitch you wasn't with me shooting in the gym)
Tell Lucien I said fuck it I'm tearing holes in my budget
Bag her like we in Publix and take her ass out in public
Ordered it a filet tell her butterfly she'll love it
She used to soda and nuggets she really just out here thuggin'
Im just hittin my pinnacle you and pussy identical
You like the fuckin finish line we can't wait to run into you
But let me get my mind of that
Young rich muthafucker getting mine off rap
With my niggas

[Hook]

[French Montana]
From the hooptie coupe to that GHOST dawg
Pigeons on the roof like GHOST dawg
Dwight Howard on the post dawg
My niggas got the powder through the post dawg
Watch the body tilt when you hit the head
Niggas lost mills tryna beat the feds
10 grams off my last 250 now
Big ass crib, 250 down, damn
Gave my nigga MAX 7-5 (MAX B)
Then they gave my nigga PENTHOUSE another 30
Fuck, got me thinking like I'm 75
Damn, nigga ain't even seen 30
