[Verse 1]
I just left the mall gettin' fresh as I can
Can't hardly walk cause I got so many bags in my hand
I'm spinnin' like that eight, winkin' at women as they walk by
Eyes red, I got the munchies, I'm zonin' cause I'm so high
How many Caddys for sho' sittin' on them fattys and Vogues
Fussin' with my niggas cause they keep on slammin' my doors
Hit the crib, now they chiefin' while I'm changin' my clothes
I put the Cadillac up and bust out with the Range Rover
I went to see my nigga Cool, I know he got sticky too
I pulled up he on the front porch puffin' a blunt or two
I copped an ounce now it's time to bounce and sweat on some hoes
But first I stopped at the store and got us some Optimos
Now we ready to roll, Lil' Rock twist up the blunts
I just love it when the women be jockin' them gold fronts
On the highway, pushin' 95 on the dash
Tryin' to hurry up and get there cause that's how we mash

[Hook x2]
It's Friday night and I'm feelin' alright
Blowin' sticky green plus I got the bank roll tight
I bet cha' the bodies will hit the strip baby
Hit the brakes on the feet and make it dip baby

[Verse 2]
We on the strip and so tight, I'm seein' cars for miles
Women smilin' yeah I know they jockin' our styles
I got diamonds against the wood, I'm knockin' up out the frame
I'm hangin' all out the window, them women callin' out my name
And bumpin' Thug Pasion, she ridin' tight ho
Flickin' hard on them twenties like was a car show
So many freaks on the set, pretty legs and tight shorts
The only hard part is makin' the right choice
Tryin' to find something super-duper stout tonight
Take her to the room and put her on the house tonight
That's how we do, runnin' game on bitches we put em' out
After we finish runnin' trains on bitches it ain't no doubt
I met a young freak, she came and got in the Rover
She had shorts up the ass now ya know it was over
Time to hit the tel, knock her off and bounce the scene
That's an every day thang when a nigga be ridin' clean

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
We dropped the freak off and headed back to the strip
I'm sippin' Moet, that bubbly got me ready to rip
Turn the pager off and seein' hoo-gobs of niggas
With they guard on like they gon' really rob some niggas
We don't worry bout jackers cause we strapped for that kind of shit
We focus on ballin' tryin' to push up behind a bitch
Hoes jockin' for sho' I seen em' lookin' off in the truck
Come on lets go home and put them legs off in the truck
We met some more freaks, fine as hell, they were nice peep
I'm rubbin' on titties I put my hand up thighs quick
They asked us to follow them to the room and smoke some bud
They smokin' with hoes, we jump on it they show us love
We down for whatever, I bust a U and got right behind her
She rounded her friends up and they jumped in the Pathfinder
We trailin' em' to the room and you know what time it is
Back to the telly now nigga we flexin' ain't that some shit
