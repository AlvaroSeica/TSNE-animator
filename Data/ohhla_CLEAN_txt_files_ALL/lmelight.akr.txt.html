[Intro - Akrobatik - talking]
Fast cars, get high, big dogs, (yep, yep) get dough
Rock ice, shine bright, livin for the limelight, limelight (yep, yep)
Fast life (uh), fast cars, get high, big dogs (yep, yep)
Get dough, rock ice, shine bright, livin for the limelight, limelight (yep, yep)

[Verse 1]
Yeah, yo, shorty looked good and she knew it (uh)
Everytime she stepped up in the club, brothers be marvelin at how she do it (no doubt)
But if your pockets ain't fat, then she ain't hearin ya
She college educated with a future career in her (girl)
And can't nobody tell her that she won't get hers
So if you want her by your side, you gotta cop ice and furs (uh)
Ballerina body, general manager mind (general manager mind)
That's why the story so amazin how her life got intertwined (uh)
She realized early pop dukes was a cheat
Moms come home from work to get that ass beat (ass beat)
And when they was together, the whole thing was fake
They be in the back smokin while she watch Ricki Lake
and Jenny Jones, chickenhead 101 (chickenhead 101)
And that party people is where the drama begun (begun)
Or began, cause shorty's twenty lookin for a man (man)
To get a thug in her life's the plan

[Chorus] - ("yep, yep" said several times throughout)
She want to live that - fast life, ride in the - fast cars
She wanna - get high, and roll with the - big dogs 
Cause they all - get dough, she wanna - rock ice
So she could - shine bright, livin for the limelight

She want to live that - fast life, ride in the - fast cars
She wanna - get high, and roll with the - big dogs 
Cause they all - get dough, she wanna - rock ice
So she could - shine bright, livin for the limelight, limelight

[Verse 2]
This young cat Slick Will pump crills up on the hill (hill)
Askin shorty daily to come on the block and chill (chill)
His pretty boy thug style put a smile on her grill (smile on her grill)
Plus she loved how he pimped his kitted out Seville (kitted out Seville) (yep, yep)
Eventually she gave into his charm (charm)
Basement parties in the hood she could be found on his arm (arm)
He the type to shoot the party up and make mad noise (mad noise)
But that only reminded her she loved bad boys (loved bad boys)
Yo, he was something straight out of a gangsta rap video (video)
Shady as all hell, but mad paid and pretty though (pretty though)
Gettin her high, steady tappin her up (tappin her up)
But when shorty forgot the pill, he started slappin her up (slappin her up)
At first they kept it all behind closed doors
And what was goin on was teachin her that is all is fair in love and war
Furthermore, she knew the glamour would be gone (gone)
When she had a baby girl it was on

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Shorty's girls steady wanted her to straight bounce on Will (bounce on Will)
But for the money stacks, Will she could count on still (count on still) (uh)
So she struggled through the lies and the occasional beatings (alright, uh)
No longer in school, now it's battered women's meetings (women's meetings)
Now she had become exactly what she always hated
A lonely hurt soul, easily manipulated
This story doesn't have a happy ending (no)
Grandma always told her baby girl to be careful who she befriended (yep, yep)
A person's only deep as the company they keep (keep)
So when these selfish con men roll up, you can't sleep (word)
She realized hindsight is 20/20 (20)
That night will got knocked and cats wanted their money
She knew he stashed his dough in the crib (crib)
The last thing shorty ever saw was a steel toe in the ribs (steel toe in the ribs, damn)
Luckily her baby girl was at the babysitter
Let's hope the same tragic fate doesn't lie with her

{Chorus]

(yep, yep)
(yep, yep)
(yep, yep)

(Yep, yep)
