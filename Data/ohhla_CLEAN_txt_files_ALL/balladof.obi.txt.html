[Obie Trice: Talking over chorus]
I'd like to reintroduce myself, haha
If you don't know by now. It's Obie Trice man

[1st verse]
I came from nothing solo, straight outta the dumpster hobo
Made up my monster, I was cultivatingly slanging that cocoa
Hated the po po, locally known as abominable snow-o
Later the pig fo' rated the home where I made the dough grow
So on and so fo', the story of us urban negros
Created as equals we wouldn't have to be so eager to mistreat you
We as a people heated in evenings doing these evils
Gotta eat you, be cool, got a kid to feed that'll reach you
Or did it see thru? Or do I just speak thru the EQ just to say I got a hot sequel
When niggaz on the block gotta eat, gotta cop, gotta cot when they caught by the cops
Young Tupac's, laid in the box or they age in a cell blocks, fade away
Brick walls, steel gates, can't wait for the day to be free, that's why I'm

[Chorus]
[Obie talking over chorus]
Seen it, I done ate it, I done shit it
Slept it, lived it, now I spit it
Shady

[2nd verse]
Working that house off an no-doze, got an ounce to roll on
Trying to get rid of the pounds, I gotta whip the bounce, I gotta put that chrome on
Same old song, young nigga thats trying to get some where I come from
Funds, need 'em in abundance, whole bunch, only way a city boy function
In conjunction with selling this substance
Chips stay up, fuck it, glucks keep coming, take another pie out the oven
I'ma be hugging these corners till these corners corner me
But currently, I'm calculating this currency, urgency
Gotta earn a G, uphearnestly, up early when the birds'll sing
It's an emergency, never did occur to me, that the first and the third'll be
Such a thirst for me, life almost took a turn for the worst for me took to see
I finally had a purpose on Earth's surface the seed that was birthing me
[Obie] Gotta do a little soul searching and [Obie] myself personally
And to think all Em had to hear is one verse from me
To confirm and unblur my dreams
Best believe since burst on the scene, I'ma be here certainly
With no uncertainties, yes indeed, I'ma get this cheese and that's why he's

[Chorus fades out]

[Obie talking over chorus]
That's why I'm
That's what made me
Haha
That's why I'm
Young black man in America
Get up and get yours nigga
I know you struggling man, I been there
I see you
Get up and get yours nigga
Ain't no looking back now</pre>
