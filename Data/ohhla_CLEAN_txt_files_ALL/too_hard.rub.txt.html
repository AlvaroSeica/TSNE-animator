Song:   Too Hard 4 Radio
Typed by: Cno Evil

[Chorus: Rubbabandz]
Too hot for TV, too hard for radio
Spit nothing but hot fire, but you don't hear me though
The type to wear, ski mask all in my video
And no I'm not a dancing, Diddy, C.E.O.

[Rubbabandz]
I'm Bandz, five star general
I talk, I wreck, I never speak subliminal
If I got a problem with you, I address it
I put it in the air, while a nigga in my presence
I can't understand, talking indirect
I put your name in the verse, career in the herse
I blat niggas out the water if I bomb first
Ya'll small time, better re-up, get more work
Ya'll little league niggas, nickels and dimes
I got a million dollar flow, send chills up spines
I got a million dollar lady, drive me crazy
She's so insecure, she think I'm so shady
So laid back, I seem lazy
Been through so much hell, nothing can phase me
Sitting at the bottom of the world, no where else to go but up
Grab the dice and get 'em, girl

[Chorus]

[Hook: Rubbabandz]
I'm B-A-N-D-Z, and yes my gangsta come naturally
So ya'll niggas better not step to me
Cuz ya'll little niggas ain't half of me

[Rubbabandz]
I'm what the streets been missin'
Bout to chop these dogs up like a Chinese kitchen
I been sitting back for too long, my palm's itching
Alot of hit singles made from underhand pitching
Niggas paying the play, they songs on the radio
Program directors, strictly it's hell, for really though
Fucking it up for real niggas with some heat
That get out and grind on the street
I keeps hoes alive on the street, when they listen to me
Pop been number one, underground CD
New Jack City, Bandz is finally here
Underground rap nigga of the year, it's so clear

[Chorus]
