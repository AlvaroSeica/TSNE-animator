[Intro: Freeway]
Ok! Steele! Tek! Philly Freezer Smif-N-Wess!!! That's right!

[Steele]
All praised be man you know what it is!

[Freeway]
We in the buildin! Philly to BK!

[Steele]
Pete Rock! And Smif-N-Wessun!

[Freeway]
Tek! Get 'em!

[Verse One: Tek] (Pete Rock)
If you love me say your lovin me man (Lovin me man)
Dont wait 'til I'm gone to say your lovin me fam (Lovin me fam)
'Cause, when it's said and done and ya said nothin (Uh)
You 'gon be wishin that you would've said somethin (No Doubt)
I can't smell the creed when I'm six feet, deep
In the box with dirt, thrown on top of me (Word)
Why you wanna wait tell I'm not pleasin (I Don't know son)
To cry on my chest so tell me how you was feelin (Uh huh)
Just say I'll tell 'em, let 'em see me at my best (At your best)
But your not knowin how much time is left (Uh huh)
You keep sayin well I'll get around to it (To it)
But they say the same thing so nobody ever do it (No doubt)
I've been through it, wishin I could take it back (Uh!)
Turn the clock back, to where we fell out at (What)
If I could I part waters like Moses (Uh huh)
And give you dozens while you can still smell the roses 

[Chorus: Freeway]
Still got love here, you thought all the love was gone
I do what my brothers do, not when while my brothers gone
Now when all the love gone, you wish that the love would stay
I do what my brothers do, pray to who my brothers pray...too
Still got love here, you thought all the love was gone
I do what my brothers do, not when while my brothers gone
Now when all the love gone, you wish that the love would stay
I do what my brothers do, pray to who my brothers pray.... too

[Verse Two: Tek] (Steele)
Just think (Just think) If BIG and 'Pac made peace
(And you could say somethin to both of them what would it be?)
What about your brother just got murdered?
(When you was cryin sayin sorry do you think that he heard it?)
For seven years, sisters not speakin
(Car accident claimed one and now the other tweakin)
One cousin killed the next over three keys
(That sound like Rich and 'Po if you ask me?)
Mother and daughter at each others throat)
(Daughter get raped) Mother can't cope
Never said sorry, before they left home
(She felt she ruined her life so she took her own)
Now daddy fucked up drugs gettin sucked up
(He got a grandbaby that he gotta raise up)
If I could I part waters like Moses
And give you dozens while you could still smell the roses

[Chorus: Freeway]
Still got love here, you thought all the love was gone
I do what my brothers do, not when while my brothers gone
Now when all the love gone, you wish that the love would stay
I do what my brothers do, pray to who my brothers pray.....too
Still got love here, you thought all the love was gone
I do what my brothers do, not when while my brothers gone
Now when all the love gone, you wish that the love would stay
I do what my brothers do, pray to who my brothers pray.... too

[Verse Three: Steele] (Pete Rock)
Bismillah Al-Rahman Al-Raheem
My life real, but sometimes, it seems like a dream
My aqui, advised me to stay up on my theme
Get thanks for what I have go hard for what I need
Think fast when time to eat (Time to eat baby!)
We in this together like two feet knee deep 'til we deceased (Uh!)
Some say it's the honor out here in these streets (Yeah!)
Who heart really pure who sure about their own peeps (Let 'em know!)
My friends are my fam his are each
'Cause when they, gone to sleep, we mourn and weep
While they, still on they feet, salute when we greet
That's how soldiers show respect when troop to the beat (Yeah)
If I never say the word it ain't 'cause I ain't mean it
You could judge by my deeds that I pledge my allegiance (No doubt)
If I could I part waters like Moses
And give you dozens while you could still smell the roses

[Chorus: Freeway]
Still got love here, you thought all the love was gone
I do what my brothers do, not when while my brothers gone
Now when all the love gone, you wish that the love would stay
I do what my brothers do, pray to who my brothers pray...too
Still got love here, you thought all the love was gone
I do what my brothers do, not when while my brothers gone
Now when all the love gone, you wish that the love would stay
I do what my brothers do, pray to who my brothers pray....too</pre>
