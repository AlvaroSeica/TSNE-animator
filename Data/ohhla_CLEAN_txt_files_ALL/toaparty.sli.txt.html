Typed by: AZ Lyrics

To a party the other night
Yeah just to see another fight
All this violence it just aint right yeah
Come on party people lets unite
You'll see, we're better off just you and me
You'll see, come and dance with me
Whoa oh
To a party where there is no fight yah!
To a party where its all alright
To a party that it lasts all night
To a party where we all unite
You'll see, come on baby dance with me
You'll see, just get....
They're called slightly stoopid
They fuck shit up
With the ska and the reggae
Go listen to em punk!
Get off my fuckin'
Get off the stage
The drummer's so skinny</pre>
