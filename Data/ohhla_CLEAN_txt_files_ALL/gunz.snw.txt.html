[Verse 1: Sean Price]
The god send you back to the Earth from which you came
Backsmack Earth, wind, fire and rain
Elemental, the god get busy to instrumentals
Yeah you get busy, but that's all in your mental
I sent you a note sayin', "Son, don't rhyme"
You ain't listen, in turn he got burnt with the nine
Here's a gun, there's a gun, just...everywhere's a gun
I guess everybody pussy, scared to shoot a fair one
I will Larry Holmes your dome, Shane Mosley your homey
Felix Trinidad your dad, duke you don't know me
Riddick Bowe my ho, punch the bitch in the face
Run up on her like anime, eat this cake
Eat this eight, slugs inside of your mug
Got the Eagle from Balegal plus I'm puffin' on drugs
I rap for dough, no dough, no rap
Freebies get VD, yo ass get "clap," P!
 
[Chorus] (x2)
"We got guns!"
