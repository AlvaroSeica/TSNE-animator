Performance
I got a pretty good performance
When I'm standing on the stage, they screaming my name
and they lookin at the diamonds inside of my chain
Performance
I got a pretty good performance
When I'm standing on the stage they lookin at my chain
Everybody know what I rep is the money gang

Back again, with the shit
SOD gang, God damn we make hits
Got a hundred on my chain, oh my God I'm filthy rich
'Bout the bring the pain and game, Soulja tell 'em in this bitch
and I'm standing on the stage, yeah they scream my name
50 up, go ahead and go and make it rain
I'ma do this, let's do it
I'ma go ahead and throw it
You fuckin know it
Now watch me blow it
Turned up to the max
Let's do it fuckin big
I'ma take to my city and show you where I live
Down with them killers, they'll cut you down to half
Everybody know I got a hundred on the map though
One mil, two mil
Three million dollars
Mansions, ballin
Soulja pop them collars
and everywhere I go man you can't follow them models
They taking pictures of me cause I stay poppin the bottles
I stay in gollados, I stay wit the models
I stay in the club, SOD poppin olives
and you know what my name be, you know what the gang be
You see the fuckin chain mane, you know that shit crazy

Performance
I got a pretty good performance
When I'm standing on the stage, they screaming my name
and they lookin at the diamonds inside of my chain
Performance
I got a pretty good performance
When I'm standing on the stage they lookin at my chain
Everybody know what I rep is the money gang

Looky here, I'ma show these niggas where we fuckin be
Looky here, tell 'em that we gettin 400 g's
Looky here, everything is iced with flat screens
Looky here, oh my God Soulja Boy done trampolined
and jumped off the damn map, then jumped off the damn trap
and jumped out the hood and put the set on the damn neck
Now go and run and tell 'em boys that we ain't backing down, nope
Got them fuckin rounds, yeah a hundred of the ammo
Soulja Boy my name, dressed up in camo
I'm hunting all my chains, yes I make hits
Yes I'm with yo girl and I made her suck that dick
Hundred on my whip, God damn I be the shit
I'm still 1up, I'm still set to rob
I'm west side on simpset, I'm 'bout to put it down
You niggas know my name
Buckhead yellow diamond shawty drop top range
Le-go

Performance
I got a pretty good performance
When I'm standing on the stage, they screaming my name
and they lookin at the diamonds inside of my chain
Performance
I got a pretty good performance
When I'm standing on the stage they lookin at my chain
Everybody know what I rep is the money gang</pre>
