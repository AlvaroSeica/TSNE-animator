Song:   Numb
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I make music to numb your brain... [x2]
Ride the wave...

[Verse 1: Cassie]
New young ruler of the beat and the vox
Breezy tonic, fresh like rain
My beat mans cruel, he's the freakiest box banger
Fox hanging on my coat, rocks hanging on my chain
And that's how you know I've been hunting the game...
Bang bang and I hit it with impeccable aim
Bang bang and I blow it up, they don't know wassup
If they think for a second that I do it for the fame
'Cuz I make music to numb your bain

I make music to numb your brain... [x3]

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Bottle after bottle, I am balling like Robert Griffin
Never made love I had her coming from a distance
Said I was a mason, Martin Margiela
Triple Beam, hustling, thats full of cheddar
Yellow brick road, was told its just a cakewalk
Now its Philip Lim on them, no more Eight Balls
Uncut, my love thats all thug
Call them different names in the middle of the club
Went on world tours, paid in all cash
Top floor views, my wall is all glass
All paid dues but normally fall fast
Same bitch you shittin on the only thing that I [?]
I am trying to see 100 of em
Kobe Bryant money, nigga you aint gotta love him
Swish, new rims on the six
Tell me that you numb if you not feeling this

Rick!

[Verse 3: Cassie]
When I make the wave, you ride it
(Ride the wave, ride the wave)

If you insane and it's late in the night
You can smoke one, pop one, close your eyes
You can say this in your mind
And I say it all the time
Im the same, insane
Its a damn good time
Its a damn good time
Im just saying its a damn good time
In-vi-gorating, impact ya like ice
Beat, pulsating, your heart skips twice
On the bass drum, and them pumps so nice
Heart skips twice, and them pumps so nice
On the bass drum, pumps so nice
Heart skip, ride the wave

I make music to numb your brain... [x4]

It's a damn good time, I'm just saying it's a damn good time...

When I make the wave (ride the wave) [x2]

I make music to numb your brain...</pre>
