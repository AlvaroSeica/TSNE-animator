Typed by: AZ Lyrics

It's like you think you know me
But you don't really know me
And one day you gon' wake up and figure that out
And when that day comes
I'm thinkin you'll prolly leave

Now I don't know how long my forevers gon' be
But I invite you to come and spend mine with me
And I'm a do my best to see that we live happily
And you just keep what's left when somethin happens to me
I'm lookin for someone to marry me
Take care of me
And bury me
These days that's a rarity but I can guarantee
If I broadcast live from deep within me
God will send me someone only divinity can ever get the credit for
And I can take her from the hood to tha gucci store.god give her an og' fo a daddy
Bad broad for her momma
From tank tops and thongs, to them prada pajamas
And I'm a be awake when I'm posed to be asleep
Cause my minds on my money
And I know when I'm a be
What I so?
I'm a be some shit, be heavily medicated
Huh, that's they opinion, to me I'm just dedicated
Motivated by the thoughts of empty mouths
Nightmares and comin home to an empty house
I know what it is, to see somethin fail titanic
Built a castle, and watched it colapse in front of me
My daughter, she survived the tragedy
The aftermath, and my attempt at a family
So don't sit up here and talk about what I already know
Or sit up here and act as though you would never go
You like you would never ever pack ya bags and leave
I'm not comparin you to her
It's a reaction of me
People take all they can take and I just run em away
Even I can't believe some of the stuff that I say
The holes in the walls can easily be fixed with mud
The holes in us can only be repaired with love
But they can only be mended
They can never be fixed
Because people forgive you, but they can never forget

[x2:]
I'm hard to love
Some say I'm hard to like
But I been through alotta thangs and I'm scarred for life
I got bruises on my spirit, dents in my chin
And I'm never lettin anybody get me again

Now if you never been in love
This irrelvant to you
If you there, pray for me
And I'm a pray for you too
Babygirl I'm trynna see
All of yo dreams real
So try to understand how my size 14's feel
I need anotha female like a hole in the head
And if I eva caught you cheatin, it'd be holes in the bed
And holes in the head
Of a man caught up in the middle
Of a good thang gone bad
I ain't sorry for it, uh
But I can never invision
You betrayin me
The one you don't suspect
That's the one it's gon' be
No trust, otha than my trust in god
Cause everyone I ever trusted has broke my heart
I keep my guard up
And it can neva be lowered
You can neva sucka punch me, I'm forever lookin for it
You go through the bad, just to get to the good
Somethin I wish more people understood

[x2:]
I'm hard to love
Some say I'm hard to like
But I been through alotta thangs and I'm scarred for life
I got bruises on my spirit, dents in my chin
And I'm never lettin anybody get me again

You ever seen two old people walkin in the rain
One of em got the body, and the otha got the brains
Dang, they prolly got grandkids my age
People don't love like that these days
They too quickly say forget it
Turn it away and leave it
To the point of where that love
Is nothin but a image
Lights and smoke, 2 way mirrors
So the people on the outside don't see errors
And you can no longer create the fascade?
And you done talked to everybody about it but god
She gon' make mistakes
But so will you
You shouldn't say nothing that you wouldn't want her to
Say to you, if you was in the spot she's in
Love, makes exceptions, and takes direction
Babygirl, just hold me down for now
Before you know it you'll be married to a whole new ground?

[x2:]
I'm hard to love
Some say I'm hard to like
But I been through alotta thangs and I'm scarred for life
I got bruises on my spirit, dents in my chin
And I'm never lettin anybody get me again

I'm hard to love</pre>
