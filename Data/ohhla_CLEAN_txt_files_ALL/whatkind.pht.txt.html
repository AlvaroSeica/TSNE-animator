Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus: 2x]
What kinda woman you is, what kinda man you like
What kinda shit you like to do to make you feel alright
What kinda car you like to drive, what kinda job you got
What kinda shit you like to buy, what kinda fit you rock

You go to school or you finished, drive a beamer or a bentley
You ratchet all alone or you just home independent
A business or a dentist, a dancer or you be trickin
Not a big difference I just love women who tryna get it
From the bathroom, to the living room, to the kitchen
She be cookin she be cleanin hold it down when ya up in prison
Apartment, condo, or a house, how you livin,
You stay up in the A so you like to shop at Lennox
You keep yo mouth closed cuz you don't like em in yo business
you in love with just one nigga, no they got plenty
You faithful and you taken you don't like fuckin with many
Like a nigga in true religion jeans don't do the dishes
Drank ciroc or that goose, a photo or a coupe
Ain't even gotta tell her she bad know she the truth
Facebook and twitter she still do it bigger
ain't even gotta trip worry bout nare nigga

[Chorus: 2x]

You hate hoes in yo business huh
playin on phones like children that shit be sickenin huh
Yo man broke as the fuck you independent huh
you tell em fuck who you want
you don't be trippen huh that's what I'm talkin bout
I just like a woman like to keep herself together
It's sumthin bout a woman who suck it and suck it better
Hands down you ain't fuckin with her cuz she better
One of them girl rappers got a bad bitch swagger
Like a nigga in the streets don't like puttin up with his shit
think he fuckin with a hoe he might be cookin up a brick
Keep yo friends out yo mix, they'll fuck up your relationship
I call her trina when I'm leanin cuz I patient sip
when she ride it like my fiyah cuz the way she dip
Don't get mad give her a kiss like the way she trip
When I'm rockin the stage she rep my single
With me put a cup in the air if you single with me

[Chorus: 2x]</pre>
