Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Hey Nino
Whatever ground that

Hey I see pookie trippin off the game again
Well, I don't know you what's your game again?
Oh you, this nigga back to count the change again
Word, just came out to court the body gotta change again
I see pookie trippin off the game again
I don't know you what's your game again?
Oh you, this nigga back to count the change again
Word, just came out to court the body gotta change again

What's good now pop, you and the hood now ho
You think the shit sweet like they don't get down harm
I've seen you when you creep you try to hit down son
But he ran that's when you told us amidst to get down huh
You think you all lack the shooters shit now huh?
You need to fall back before you get fowl humble
No lob, war from the [?] you need to skip down done
It's a job, and none of the guys I gotta get pounds from
Get em out, will string the bell shit, bullets hurt and it felt shit
He felt quick, shots in his pelvis, nigga Elvis
I don't know about that but my nigga smell this, we sell this
In the pocket lot of the celtics, [?] and got Boston problems
That George young up and down shit, we force them robbin
They told em no come around, can't walk in hollum
So we move walk down every block floss in on em
(Who's bad?)

[Chorus]
Niggas wasting their time, I gotta get mine
All day on the grind, I gotta get mine
Bitch nickles and diams, I gotta get mine
Yeah I gotta get mine, you already know Slime
Niggas wasting their time, I gotta get mine
All day on the grind, I gotta get mine
Bitch nickles and diams, I gotta get mine
Yeah I gotta get mine, you already know Slime

All over sudden niggas tough you know that ain't good
Finding on the block, much that mean I ain't hood
Paid it for like AZ but ain't wood
I play to role gold they PM a straight bull
3 80 pool, waving that at your students
Youngers ain't got the heart old, niggas was making them shooter
It was pumping if I'm from the start old
Niggas making me moving, breaking the day in the pock on
Niggas drinking the [?]
Playing card cars [?], most haters the movement
I'm from A life you could lose it
You bring the mike I'll abuse it
I'm dumb nice that I'm stupid, so retarded you garbage
I fuck with none of your music
On your carpet departed, that's only done with the shooting
Don't worry bout it, I got it
I hit em once in his duices, peace
I always come in exclusive, don't put me on
Never wait on love for the new shit

[Chorus]

I gotta get mine, you gotta get yours
I gotta get mine, you gotta get yours
I'm trying get mine you should be trying get yours
Stop watching mine 'cause I'm not watching yours
Nigga I'll call, nigga I'll call, nigga I floss
I have all the woods out, black hoods out
Nigga I'm good out, go to good out
'Cause I don't give a fuck like going wrong
Eye pulls out

[Chorus]</pre>
