[Verse 1: Muph]
Alright now
Me, I'm eager to
Continue to keep it true cause
It's not me, it's you
Yeah, I can repeat that too cause
It's not me, it's you
So quick I'm bleeding blue
Off tits and teething too
We can release these screws
That means they're more than loose
Wanna give me a talking to?
Not tonight, you got a boring view
Not me who kicked in the door
Woke up, who pissed on the floor?
Damn, that shit is raw
Never been a liar like this before

[Chorus: Jess Harlen] + {Muph}
We get high (high)
We get low (low)
The desire (alright)
{So beautiful, so ugly}
We get high (high)
We get low (low)
It's alright (right)
{So beautiful, so ugly}

[Bridge: Jess Harlen and Muph] {Repeat X2}
J:	High, low {*X3*}
M:	So beautiful, so ugly

[Verse 2: Muph]
She's got a sad face (okay)
Her problems are man-made (cocaine)
And Bollinger Champagne (that's the way)
Great idea, get smashed in a bad state
How's it taste to devour the sour grapes?
The powder face needs Powerade
The power play came an hour late
And how he behaves at twenty-eight
Is out of date, I'm out of shape
And out of place, let's celebrate
The thousand takes, the town, we'll
paint - red was-ted
With a day spent in a made bed
Make noise for complainin neighbours
Keep smilin like Kasey Chambers
Make friends with dangerous strangers
Dutch courage, currently courageous
So aimless, I ain't got the faintest
I'm faded, and brainless
My dress sense is so tasteless
I'm wasted, my facelift
It majors - in agein
Not playin - escapin
The threats that test my patience

[Bridge]

[Verse 3: Muph]
No inhibitions in here
Guess I'm a little like Britney Spears
Endeared to fifth gear
Then increase to quick steer
I shit me to tears
I'ma gumboot through the river of fear
Actin like I'm pimp of the year
But probably shrink when they get too near
Go ahead, let's clip this beard
Of shame, pass the blame when it's clear
As day, I won't hear my name
Appear insane, I'm searing flames
Scorchin - stumblin, walkin
Like I'm highly important
Nauseous, I'm far from flawless
Awkward - to the ears I've tortured

[Chorus]
