[Hold On, Hold On, Hold On, Hold On]

This is a tribute, 
to the playas who get loot
And all my peoples out there on the street, tryin' to eat
Make money, take money, that's the hustla's hymn
Got chu runnin' thru these ghetto streets scuffin' ur Tims
And it don't stop,
til somebody calls the cops
When the ball drops
I'ma snatch all the props
For all my brotha's in the struggle
Who learned to juggle
Jus be strong, and live long, you know I love you
Crime pays,
But we need to news ways to maintain
Cuz when I see you fall I feel the same pain
Like when they had you in the penile
You did ur time, ur free now
We bound to keep it real, until we old and senile
I got a fly scheme, to multiple my cream
Put a solider on my team, like my brother Raheem
will organize, a enterprise and represent one time
So my crew could succeed and my seeds will see sunshine
We came from nuttin', they kept cuttin' down my family tree
You'll understand why, we don't plan to die and strive to be free

Now hold on, hold on, hold on, my peoples hold on, hold on
Be strong
Hold on, my peoples hold on

Yo it's all the same, in the Hall of Fame
I just want to be ready when he calls my name
This material, world, is a ball and chain
Live your life righteous or it's all in vain
It's all the same, in the Hall of Fame
I just want to be ready when he calls my name
This material, world, is a ball and chain
Live your life righteous or it's all in vain
Now, hold on

This world got me stressed, though I know I'm blessed
I'll probably feel safer wit the nine and a steel vest
I run wit the unafraid, who wanna get paid
by any means, even if it means, guns gettin' sprayed
and drug raids, and other thugs laid to rest
He died trife, somebody told me life's, a test
Some pass wit flyin' colors, while others drop out
Some never got a chance, got knocked out
the box, and ghetto blocks, is trife
and we live by the knife
And die young, I'm hearin' shots echo in the night
I can't sleep tight, me, I was raised by the street life
Got me forever open, hopin', that we never meet twice

Now hold on, hold on, hold on, my peoples hold on, hold on
Be strong
Hold on, my peoples hold on

Yo it's all the same, in the Hall of Fame
I just want to be ready when he calls my name
This material, world, is a ball and chain
Live your life righteous or it's all in vain
It's all the same, in the Hall of Fame
I just want to be ready when he calls my name
This material, world, is a ball and chain
Live your life righteous or it's all in vain
Now, hold on

This is dedicated, to all the street corner hustlas
all my project peoples, the 85er's, born survivors
To my brother, Raheem, still trapped up in The Belly, its time to come home
To all my peoples on lock, hold on, be strong,
To my pops, Malik, don't let Harlem be your world
If ya lost lookin' for light, jus know there's a way out
This is for you, do whatcha gotta do
Jus hold on, be strong
Hold on

Hold on</pre>
