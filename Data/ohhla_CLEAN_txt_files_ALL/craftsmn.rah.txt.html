Typed by: Quest Rah

Craftsmen builders
Heroes villains
Move wit the illest
1s in the air if you feel this
Gotta gotta make way
Gotta gotta make ways
raps snap ankles its handled dangled like vanilla mic tangled
tangible flow all angles is HANDLED extractin dope beats like ore
its raw
ya styles washed up like bodies on the shore
false idols spotted like a leopard
no effort boom wreck it
tune methods who's steppin in write benevolent
lines checkin em swing like a pendulum
hyenas I be fendin em off with his melon
wit no stressin' emblem embezzelin'
I take it serious
get trapped like Chileans hidden in the pavilion lyric kill about a
million  rappers talkin high like helium
get slit like Japanese flicks where bloods and guts be spillin-in
not feelin' em creep above the ceilin' while you vibe and lounge n chillin' in
leave you needin' penicillin' wit the rhymes I drillin in
ha pow
pierced wit the metal shards raise the flag above the stars
La Illah ill ALLAH
No matter who you are
Like my fam nomadic said You still a mortal need a bed
lines dynamic so they bled Heads be needin' Sudafed
The cool effect mad respect  walk the plank while I'm on deck
You lack spirit like violence that poppin off
between the sects
pop ya ear off like Van Gogh
get ready for the standoff
pow pow
hands off

Aiyyo
Craftsmen builders
Heroes villains
Move wit the illest
1s in the air if you feel this
Gotta gotta make way
Gotta gotta make ways

Aiyyo drop a jewel iller fool cool wit the mic tool
shoot wit the harpoon You dial up this digital
This Situation critical Elevation minimal
Gravitation pull these rappers off their high horse
Move past Fast From the school of the craftsmen
Broadcast on beats Food for the fastin'
Hungry Tools sharp Praise the Everlasting
Tribezman productions Horseback marksmen
Yep yep
Make P, count beads, still eat
Lyrics smack an MC's slave to the industry
BREAK free like the chain of Samson
Disappear faster than a phantom
trouble like Somali pirates askin ransoms
hip hop is dead
hijacked by the devilish
only benefit is a pit
full of venomous
sentences flow from my pen
but you never heard
testament of a scribe
all I gots my jewels and my word</pre>
