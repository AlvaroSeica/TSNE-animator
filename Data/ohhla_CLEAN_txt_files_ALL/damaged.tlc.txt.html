I know I'm kinda strange
To you sometimes
Don't always say
What's on my mind
You know what I've been hurt
By some guy
But I don't wanna mess up this time

[Bridge]
And I really really really care
And I really really really want you
And I think I'm kinda scared
Cuz I don't wanna lose you
If you're really really really there
Then maybe you can hang through
I hope you understand
It's nothin' to you

[Chorus]
My heart's at a low
I'm so much to manage
I think you should know that
I've been damaged
I'm fallin' in love
There's one disadvantage
I think you should know that
I've been damaged

I might look through your stuff
For what I don't wanna find
Or I might just set you up
To see if you're all mine
I'm a little paranoid
From what I've been through
Don't know what you got yourself into

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

My heart's at a low
I'm so much to manage...</pre>
