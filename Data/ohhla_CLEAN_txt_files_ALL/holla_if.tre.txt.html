[Trey Songz]
Holla
Whoa whoa whoa oh
I know its been a minute since we really kicked it
But I just want you to know
I cant pretend that everythings all good
Nope I cant say that everythings all bad
But I'm gonna say that you be on my mind
How you doin, who you with, where you be at
Girl, we've had our share of ups and downs
But you know that I'm gon' always be around that's fo sho
And you know how we do, how I roll
And remember aint a damn thing change so

[Chorus]
Holla if you need me
You always gon' be my boo
Holla if you need me
You know I still got'chu
And if you ever need me to be
What you need girl, I'm free and foreva you can holla at me
So, holla if you need me
You always gon' be my boo
Holla if you need me
You know I still got'chu
If you ever need me to be
What you need girl I'm free and forever you can holla at me

[Trey Songz]
I still be thinkin bout the things you do
I still be thinkin bout the times we had
Don't wanna seem like ive be missin you
But I am and damn its bad girl
Girl, we've had our share of ups and downs
But you know that I'm gon' always be around that's fo sho
And you know how I do, how I roll
And remember aint a damn thing change so

[Chorus]

[Trey Songz]
Girl, you can holla at me
Whoa whoa
Girl I really really really wanna let'chu know
That I really really really cant let'chu go
And even if we never get it back girl you can still come and holla at me [x2]

[Chorus] - first half 2X

[Trey Songz]
Girl I really really really wanna let'chu know
That I really really really cant let'chu go
And even if we never get it back girl you can still come and holla at me</pre>
