Kamachi!!!!!
JuJu Mob!!!!
I'm back y'all
C'mon

[Chief Kamachi]
Yo, believe me I know the feelin'
Tryna escape the killin'
Wanna build a village for the little ghetto children
Wit lead paint pealin' from their project ceilin'
And tears for so many shot in the midst of the dealin'
We need... hugs and healin' to patch the wounds overtime
Bring the glossiness back to corroded minds
We was Kings beatin' drums in Mali
And now we stashin' drugs in alleys
So rowdy everyday feel just like wars in Saudi
Not exactly, but I know you get the idea
King I and "Quite Clear"
Ancient divine, sheer a lion glare
Don't hesitate to let loose the iron here
I keep spittin' it ill, cuz my strip is real
Was a broke nigga hittin' the field
Wit a clip and a steel
Catch 'em while he in his wheel
Don't wanna put money grip on his shield
But he don't wanna sunny dip killed
The blood splash on the kid is surreal
Full of couple of chips, there was nothin' to peel
This hood nigga give you somethin' to feel
Tryna change my life, no longer bang the steel
Or stand behind it
Cuz I done seen some days tryna clean my ways
But I'm barely out my schemin' phase
So watch out for the beamin' rays
THE GOSPEL!!!!!!</pre>
