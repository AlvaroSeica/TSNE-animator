[Chorus: R. Kelly] + (Ashanti)
If it wasn't for the money, cars and movies stars and jewels
And all these things I got
I wonder, hey
Would you still want me (Want you)
Would you still be calling me (Still calling you)
You be loving me? (I'll be loving you)

[Ja Rule]
Wanna keep you flawed with no dough
Pimpin ain't easy
Trust me I know
When gangstas and hos
Go go go go go go together
Lke chinchilla and bad weather
I'm good but been better
All my bros, chedda and glamorous things
Copped a few cars
A crib with a east and west wing
Cuz this is how I'm livin and yall women know the secrets
Of how to get it and keep it
How to prey on my weakness
Cuz the power of p-u-s-s-y
Got a lotta niggaz wonderin it ain't just I
Gotta keep ya cash comin and that's on my life
If it wasn't for the money and the things I got
Shit, she probably wouldn't like me
But I keep her and Irv and Jeffrey quite icy
Sip seraphim, who doesn't like me
And the murderous I-N-C

[Chorus]

[Ja Rule]
I wonder why love is about money
And why wou wanna take it all from me
Honey
My life is dark but its lovely
Crimes cars cribs ain't that right Kelly?
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh)
Yall bitches don't know
Money ain't a thang
Mami need a lil change
Girl I'm pitchin quarters
Closest to the arches but live in a fortress
New benzes new porsches
New cases new lawyers
im becoming the infamous notorious rule
Niggaz couldn't walk a mile in my shoes
Niggaz don't possess the heart that I do
And it's a wonder that I'm still here
Thought I was gone but I'm still here
And all you bitches that left me here
Its kinda funny how you right back there

[Chorus]

[R. Kelly]
Oh oh oh oh ohhhhh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh ohhhh
Oh oh oh oh

Ashanti..

[Ashanti]
Now how many nights does it take to make you
Believe my love? All these years, done had your kids
How could you wonder? (Hey yea)
See I was with you throught he rain and the thunder
And all the crying and the pain, who you run to?
Now tell me baby, do you still wonder? (Hey Yea)
Cause I'm that chick from I.N.C
Some try to front, but them chicks aint me
Straight to the top, you all gonna see
All my ladies say, "Ohh ohhh ohhh oh"
It's no wonder why we still here
And all this hatin and we still here
You didn't think we would be here
Aint no mistaken this is our year

[Chorus]

[R. Kelly]
Oh oh oh oh ohhhhh
Oh oh oh oh
