[Joe Budden Talking]
You look familiar
I swear seen you some where before are you sure 
Are you sure we never meet 
Naw I'm not using it for some cheap pick up line
I really think you look familiar

Look she be calling my name 
Screaming real loud I would think she's pain
Nigga's tried to tell me her head was insane
Everything she do it takes a toll on my brain 
It seems a little strange but she be calling my name 
Screaming real loud I would think she's pain
Nigga's tried to tell me her head was insane
Everything she do it takes a toll on my brain 
It seems a little strange but she be calling my

[Verse 1]
She don't gotta a name 
So for now lets call her Ashley 
Had her gym clothes on
Seen her when she passed me 
Met her up in Exxon
Body was the nicest 
Cursing up a storm
She complaining bout the prices 
She just left Toronto for Jerz brough a condo
Know everything about her though we never had a convo
Pops wasn't around much 
Her mother raised her
Got so much in common that 
I don't like to face her 
Her parents are dope heads 
She dropped out of school to 
Got the same tat's at me and I find that unusual
That I smoke cigs stay they're bad for my own health
Said I'll never love me cause I don't love my own self
Gave me the ass the first night and I gladly tossed it 
The best part was I didn't even have to ask for it 
Her period don't ever come 
And when I dick her down she always run  

[Chorus]
She be calling my name 
Screaming real loud I would think she's pain
Nigga's tried to tell me her head was insane
Everything she do it takes a toll on my brain 
It seems a little strange but she be calling my name 
Screaming real loud I would think she's pain
Nigga's tried to tell me her head was insane
Everything she do it takes a toll on my brain 
It seems a little strange but she be calling my 

[Verse 2]
She like to scream so the neighbor's might hear her 
For some reason like it in front of the mirror
Let me make it clearer 
She be making strange request 
And I'm not talking bout just pulling on her hair oooooonn
She be saying choke me like I lost all respect 
And every time I do marks show up on my neck 
She say punch 
her smack her 
Like I'm an attacker 
I say you a fool
I say just do what I asked ya
I be going slow until she tell me do it faster 
Every time I'm out with her these nigga just harass her 	
I don't understand it 
She so unattractive 
Shorty looking terrible 
Plus she come with baggage
I tap it 
Though she below my average it deceives me 
She be talking marriage saying she'll never leave me 
I say I'm gonna bounce 
But I say I don't believe me 
She fucks me every time she sees me 

[Chorus]
She be calling my name 
Screaming real loud I would think she's pain
Nigga's tried to tell me her head was insane
Everything she do it takes a toll on my brain 
It seems a little strange but she be calling my name 
Screaming real loud I would think she's pain
Nigga's tried to tell me her head was insane
Everything she do it takes a toll on my brain 
It seems a little strange but she be calling my 

[Verse 3]
I be wanting ta 
Strangle her
Throw her off the balcony 
Dangle her 
Mangle her 
How long have I carried this anger for 
How come when we argue
We have to get physical 
We crucial conflict 
She ends up in critical 
Habitual 
Happens daily 
It's our ritual 
But show your face bitch stop being invisible
Is it just my mental 
Is she just a symbol
There for me to look at everything that I resemble
Sometimes during sex I blurt another name
Do that mean I look at me and be ashamed 
I'm cheating on me 
With a hottie 
with a body
Who so happen to embody
Everything I so happen to not be 
I be tryna leave her 
But then I get lenient
And since I'm in this room alone 
She become convenient 
Then we lie together 
Cry together 
I swear I hope we die together 

[Chorus]
She be calling my name 
Screaming real loud I would think she's pain
Nigga's tried to tell me her head was insane
Everything she do it takes a toll on my brain 
It seems a little strange but she be calling my name 
Screaming real loud I would think she's pain
Nigga's tried to tell me her head was insane
Everything she do it takes a toll on my brain 
It seems a little strange but she be calling my 

[Verse 4]
I finally grew the balls to tell shorty we should separate 
Save your breathe nothing you can do to make me hesitate 
There no room for me and you to grow
Don't love me then leave me alone do both
Then she apologize for anything that she did 
Said with out me she can't think of no reason to live 
Said she'll miss getting piped down 
The she picked up a shank
I to tell the crazy bitch to put the knife down
Crying 
Eye shadow on her face
Filthy 
Feel me if you kill you 
It's gonna kill me 
Really 
She said you neglect me 
I said we the same 
So whatever you do it's gone affect me 
You know I can't let it be 
So if we have to stay together just to co-exist then so it is 
She said I loved you then hugged me 
Took her pants off and proceeded to fuck me 

[Chorus]
She be calling my name 
Screaming real loud I would think she's pain
Nigga's tried to tell me her head was insane
Everything she do it takes a toll on my brain 
It seems a little strange but she be calling my name 
Screaming real loud I would think she's pain
Nigga's tried to tell me her head was insane
Everything she do it takes a toll on my brain 
It seems a little strange but she be calling my</pre>
