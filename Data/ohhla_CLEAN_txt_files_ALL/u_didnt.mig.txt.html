Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus: Quavo]
Don't act like you don't know I got them racks bitch
Don't act like you don't know I got them packs bitch
Don't act like you don't know I'm wildin' out biiitch
Don't act like you don't know that's who I am bitch
Don't act like you don't know, don't act like you don't know
Don't act like you don't know, don't act like you don't know

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Don't act like you don't know, don't act like you don't know
No Homer Simpson but you know I keep that dough
All white diamonds look just like a line a coke
Like Rozay, Quavo get it off the boat
Smoking loud ass gas, make a nigga choke
And I know you smoking mid, I see that barrel smoke
Take your bitch to the mall, she walking out with Coach
Now I got her running plays like I am the coach
Hang them on a rope, soldiers trained to go
All my niggas don't move till I say so
Niggas trapping out a mansion and a Lambo
Can't see the troops cause they wearing camo

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Takeoff]
Don't act like you don't know
2 cups drink a lil' bit mo'
[?] no Shawty L-o
Bricks like Soulja, man they always on gold
When you see the squad better act like you know
In the kitchen with the stove [?]
Got the hood saying 'Jumping out the bando'
Niggas mad acting like they don't know
Bill G put terror in your squad
And I walk around pockets on Fat Joe
Walk around with the deuce deuce
Smoking on fat ass blunts Bruce Bruce
Riding in the truck with no motherfucking roof
And it got 2 doors would've thought it was a coupe
Hit the gas in my [?]
Hit hard like a nigga smoking Kimbo
And when I sip the lean, lean low like a nigga playing limbo
Pull up in a drop top lambo
All the kids they scream out 'Bingo'
That bitch who I could afford her [?] new world order

[Chorus]</pre>
