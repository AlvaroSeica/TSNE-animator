[Blue Raspberry]
Damn, my mans calling the cell
And he's getting me stressed as hell
But tonight I'm gonna say 'oh well'
I know I gotta get right for real
My peoples on the other line
Saying let's meet out round nine
Ladies free in the club til ten
Let me finish this bottle of gin

[Chorus: Blue Raspberry]
Hey, Mr. DJ
You gotta get it poppin' for sure
Get the people on the floor
I want that feel good vibe
You gotta make me lose my mind

[Blue Raspberry]
Uh, it's about to begin
Night fall is about to come in
Picked up about five of my friends
Just big enough for ours to get in
Hit the strip, to see who's it
Cute and long, and bikes riding around
Some made my head spin around
It's the weekend and it's going down

[Chorus]

[Hook: Blue Raspberry]
We're going to the spot tonight
I'm ready to get delirious, I'm serious
I'm going to have some fun and get right
I'm going to get delirious, I'm serious

[Chorus 3X]</pre>
