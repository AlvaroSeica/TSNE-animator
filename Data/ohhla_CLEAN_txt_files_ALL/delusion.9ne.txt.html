Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
Yeah... Like this (like this) Ima drink this henn
Ima keep this grin
but if you look at nina closly I'm tryina contain this beast within
I know some of yall already knowin that I got alotta cheese to spend
but that don't change the fact I go insane I gotta heap of sins please begin

I saw a glimspse in all of this when I was just yay tall
and I pictured yall and it wall to wall
but they all said I was just Delusional
but the people startin callin us and I'm ballin tough
but the crawlin rough and I never though of stuff with saw enough
What the problem is now I got em here tellin all these kids
I'm the K.O.D and they pumpin up the volume and listenen hard
when I give my heart is it Delusional
When I'm thinkin Ima boss in the biz
but I'm lost and I fake it that I'm off in the lid
but they pay the cost when it is dark at the crib
Some say that if tell them to hate
my people are at the gate ready for sealin your fate
that is up for debate cause when I make my music
ain't no evil from mister yates callin me a cult leader
I don't really know but Ima fosho
heater wickedness commin from mine rove they could blow me
but the folks wanna soul see us at the bottom
with the devil look around and it be no N9na
they say I lead em to evil like I was jimmy jones
and feedin the people when I bleed in the steeple
the reason they seizin me ain't no decreasin my ego
my powers for good I think would I shrink
if somebody took away how good I ink
but that would never happen I'm makin it with the rappin
but they want me to collapse and when I could I sink

[Chorus - Nikkiya]
I hope I find what I'm looking for
maybe I should drink just a little more
Delusional I'm fightin but I'm losin
feel like we offer up confusion Hear me!
My rights and wrongs are questioned in my life
and confusion seems to be my alibi
Delusional I'm feelin like I don't belong
feel like I'm tellin you to do wrong hear me!

[Verse 2]
She feel like I'm
gonna make them hate because I was around
and kick it and make them babys
and now that I made it gotta escape them daily
and that's crazy cause all I'm doin is makin the industry pay me
but when I show my face feelin everythings great
did a show then we ate then I'm outta that state
she said I'm a good provider but daddy of the year man I'm outta that race
how I compensate for the losses they get often dates
that's too personal we'll stop the tape

[Chorus - Nikkiya]
I hope I find what I'm looking for
maybe I should drink just a little more
Delusional I'm fightin but I'm losin
feel like we offer up confusion Hear me!
My rights and wrongs are questioned in my life
and confusion seems to be my alibi
Delusional I'm feelin like I don't belong
feel like I'm tellin you to do wrong hear me!

[Verse 3]
They say I'm seein things but everybody know
I'm bein things we dem kings like it or not we runnin this
gotta lotta hype cause I wanna spit
and I come to grip on the fifth
you gotta know techs never gonna miss
I know I might be a little psychie but its nightly
and brightly inside of me makin me a little frightening
rippin it with the right team I bring hella light
when resighting when its all said and done I'm sickened
and heavened caused this a damned reverend ALL 6'S AND 7'S

[Chorus - Nikkiya]
I hope I find what I'm looking for
maybe I should drink just a little more
Delusional I'm fightin but I'm losin
feel like we offer up confusion Hear me!
My rights and wrongs are questioned in my life
and confusion seems to be my alibi
Delusional I'm feelin like I don't belong
feel like I'm tellin you to do wrong hear me! </pre>
