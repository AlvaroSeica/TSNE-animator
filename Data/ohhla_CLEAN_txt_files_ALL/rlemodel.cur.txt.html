Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Uh...
Nothing but...
Tell the truth, do I?

I been in the game, OG
Seen fools blow up and blow it, you know it
Prophetized by the perpetually high poet
I been thru it so free game I got to throw it to the listeners
Gifted in the art of deciphering rhymes
Conjured up in the confines of a powerful mind
Between the cars and broads, you're sure to find
The story of a man who drew his own guidelines
Inspirational, ain't it?
The way shorty set his goals tall and attained'em
Professional brushstrokes on canvasses
Finger-painting amateurs, can't handle it you do best to stay in your pajamas, kid
Blew my high when you came in with them cameras
Questions and peanut gallery suggestions
I hear some drummers comin' from your section, that's cool
But we got our own beat to walk to, fool!

Uh, drinkin' from the lemonade bottle
Tell the truth, do I look like a role model?
To the kid that chose me to follow...
Life ain't nothin but bitches and Impalas

I'm, drinkin' from the lemonade bottle
Now tell the truth, do I look like a role model?
To the kid that chose me to follow...
Life ain't nothin but bitches and Impalas

Nigga! Life ain't nothin' but bitches and Impalas, yea
Lyin' ass bitches, thievin' ass partners...
To the kid that chose me to follow,
Life ain't nothin' but bitches and Impalas
Thievin' ass bitches, lyin' ass partners... yea</pre>
