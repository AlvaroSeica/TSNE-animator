Hey Muph it's Frank man
Umm I know it's your day off
look James has called in sick and I really need you to come in man
I know it's your day off bro but your really doing me a big favour, yeh
Give me a call as soon as you get this message man
I know your there

[Muph]
Ahhhhh fuck

This time was supposed to be mine now I gotta give it back to them
This time was supposed to be mine now I gotta give it back to them
This time was supposed to be mine now I gotta give it back to them
This time was supposed to be mine now I gotta fucking give it back to them

[Verse 1]
The day off I wait for a breather
Fly over the grind and then seize up
Who cares, alarm clock and freezer
at it's best no stress, put ya feet up
And you can get with me, chuck a sickie
Pull a shifty and hit the high road, dismiss the dizzy
over-exerted busy inner-citty gritty-grind in between the five toes
The light load lift, daytime TV zone when I don't do shit
but still offload any constipation making me think
We want double sided tapes so either way today we'll stick or play this 
Make this 24 hour shape shift
Holding to the click which sits with the heart beats, get drugged
They say you only live once so I'm not gonna be tight with my slight income
The day off - when we finally win some

[Chorus]
So raise your hands if you can be bothered
It's your day off
For the days that we actually did what we wanted
It's your day off
Believe me there's gonna be more I promise
It's your day off
For the days that we actually did what we wanted
It's your day off

[Verse 2]
It's not the day off but the night before
I get blindmind(ed) n find my report(?)
Doesn't matter no wake up call
I find these moments of freedom are yours
and I'ma keep drinkin until it's not fun
I'm not picky, hit me with a shot to get the job done 
So the issues will cling to all the other lost ones
Head out to the car quick to call "shotgun!"
Drop punt a bottle, full throttle through the air
Fully loaded Ford escorting us to the bear barron land 
to the snare where we salivated 
The celebreations we spit on the spaces taken
I'm out late and we've been paying in time for this 
No longer waiting stumbled to outside for a spliff
Filled these short term toast to it's top
and make the most of our time like we ain't got jobs

[Chorus] {2X}</pre>
