[DJ Drama]
Uh what can U Do

[Dro]
A... Grand Hustle man Young Dro man
A yall know me man hold up

[Chorus]
Shine 4 mouth full of gold
ridin round town lookin down on them hoes
I'm tall as a pole so put up yo 24s
I pull up in a chevy sittin on what the hell are those

[Dro]
put up yo 24s you don't want we can keep em
6s on the regal man I thank the shit illegal
and plus we ridin round on some bad as reba
we cookin up blocks we got the glass at ether
airplane motor in the jag I leave ya
nigga say finer than dro then be
I wana see I aint even got meet ya
betcha dont shine harder than them boys on
betcha benz two seter plus I ridin wit a creature
I gotta be blessed so I'm buyin blocks from a preacher

and plus we cop mo pictures than mona lisa
a I love ridin tall I love hittin the mall
I love when my trunk knock yo pictures off the wall
a 6 crawl my wrist on froze
I pull up in the chevy sitin on wat the hell are those</pre>
