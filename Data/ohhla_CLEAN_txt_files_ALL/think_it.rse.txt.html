Song:   Think it Can't Happen
Typed by: DaSun Akbar

Yeah, uh, what? What? Uh

(Chorus) Saulhaudin
Think it can't happen?
You get - got - shot - popped
Stuck for you cake, nigga
Think it can't happen?
You get - touched - rushed - crushed
Duck taped, nigga
Think it can't happen?
You get - got - shot - popped
Stuck for you cake, nigga

[Daddy Rose]
I be the man behind the madness
Keep the fire calm, till the firearm
Stocks and plastics, glock shares and bio-com
Be a head trader, do a live rom
Carry buck traces, cats like to talk with wires on
If you nervous nigga buy a chrome
In 2G nominate me "The Flyest Don"
Wifey wasn't turning me on, told her to buy a thong
Lames cross my path they get fired on
Don't give a fuck if you know Chaka Khan
I show the chrome, act up, back up, blaka!!!
Now your shoulder gon', violated
Now your youngest and older's on
Use the Mona in the trunk, now the older's gon'
Daddy been doing this shit before Rick was Ruler
Buy my bitch some stones then stick the jeweler

(Chorus) Saulhaudin
Think it can't happen?
You get - touched - rushed - crushed
Duck taped, nigga
Think it can't happen?
You get - got - shot - popped
Stuck for you cake, nigga
Think it can't happen?
You get - touched - rushed - crushed
Duck taped, nigga
Think it can't happen?

[Daddy Rose]
We kill fo'real the Ville, believe me right
Pop your ass; make your vision dark like Stevey's sight
Fuck a coward; don't try to hear 'em out
Wear 'em out, kick 'em in his ass, air 'em out
Tear his mouth, then tear his spouse
Bitch try to get away, tear her blouse
They be bling-blinging, split your cabbage
Stick your body kitchen cabinet
Take your foxes and your rabbits
Me and my dawgs splitting carrots
Talk shit behind my back
But when they see me they choke up
I've been doing this shit before New Edition broke up
Before Bobby went solo
Coca Cola shirts, denim cuts, and we're prolly wit' polo

(Chorus) Saulhaudin
Think it can't happen?
You get - got - shot - popped
Stuck for you cake, nigga
Think it can't happen?
You get - touched - rushed - crushed

[Daddy Rose]
This is to all y'all lames
I advise y'all to buy y'all some big shit
Sick shit, illegal shit, evil shit
The four-four bulldog bark and the evil spit
Mama shoulda named me Superman the way I see through shit
I was always taught to share my toys
Give a gun to all my dawgs
Air y'all boys, remi drinking
While y'all cats stay bent thinking
I'm like Jesus water walking
Y'all like Peter and your men be sinking
Shit, I was made to honor
Shave my head for what I believe like Sin√©ad O'Connor
Warning, I advise y'all don't play the corner
In the morning, come to spray the corner

(Chorus) Saulhaudin
Think it can't happen?
You get - touched - rushed - crushed
Duck taped, nigga
Think it can't happen?
You get - got - shot - popped
Stuck for you cake, nigga
Think it can't happen?
You get - touched - rushed - crushed
Duck taped, nigga
Think it can't happen?
You get - got - shot - popped
Stuck for you cake, nigga
Think it can't happen?
You get - touched - rushed - crushed
Duck taped, nigga
Think it can't happen?
You get - touched - rushed - crushed
Duck taped, nigga
Think it can't happen?
You get - got - shot - popped
Stuck for you cake, mothafucka... </pre>
