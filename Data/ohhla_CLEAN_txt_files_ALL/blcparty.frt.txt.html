[Intro: Mike Shinoda] + (Apathy)
Hey yo Ap, why don't you do the uh
Do the intro on this shit (yo, Apathy)
Yeah (Fort Minor) uh-huh (Styles of Beyond, Demigodz)
Here we go

[Apathy]
Yo, Ap is like heavy metal and ghettos, guns, metal and ammo
I pistol-whip Tony and fuck Meadow Soprano
A cat who sell them bugs but tell them thugs
They don't Â– Ap is like, Ap is.. {*scratches*}

Ap is like heavy metal and ghettos, guns, metal and ammo
I pistol-whip Tony and fuck Meadow Soprano
A cat who sell them bugs but tell them thugs
They don't know to carry more heat than welding gloves
I walk amongst the gods, keep my head in the clouds
Oh we show groupies love, gettin head in the crowd
Put it in your girl's mouth, blast off like NASA
The master of nastiness transform a classy bitch
into a little chic freak sadomasochist 
Dastardly bastard of rap so disasterous
Spittin healed a cripple like Christ the miraculous
And fights my savageness, turns punks pacifists
The police clock Ap like "There he go"
Always on the watch cause I used to carry blow
Always lock her down but I never marry hoes
Bury foes when the flows come through your stereos

[Mike Shinoda]
There we go, flippin a predictable verse
It's a curse to burst words like turrets on purpose
Put the verb like a backhand reject perverse as it is
I can't stop and it's makin me nervous, okay?
Get me on a track and I'm crackin
Packin up a backpack full of tracks on some CD's
Be me? Fuck that! Not likely
To bite me you need to be you times ninety
I got schemes and a team so hyped we
get on the scene, make a scene on the nightly
Say what I mean, whether mean or politely
Livin the dream in some clean white Nike's
Or DC's, I'm not givin a shit
Fuck the words that you heard and the lips that they hang from
I stay bangin to bang, bang drums and hangin you lames
and the same no-name gangs you came from
I don't got an excuse, just talkin the truth
I'm fuckin awesome when I'm rockin the booth
And I stay ready with hot block rockin abuse
Y'all are really not stoppin us dude
Yeah Tak, get 'em!

[Tak]
Uhh, it started off takin over and hit the galaxy
Now we're movin them over, they're crownin me the Cali king
Anything tossed in my view is gettin chewed up
With a quota six and little good weight, too much
Hooligans smacked in the face with aluminum bats
Your fuckin raps are as good as me boo-boo'in
I said I was rude, step in the shoes
You don't believe me, you can ask Devin the Dude
how I strip down your bitch, clown, stand in my socks
And whippin motherfuckers ass like I'm Cannibal Ox
You wanna be stoned? Beat him with a basket of rocks
Then get your shit flowin, feenin for the casket to drop
You know them S.O.B.'s never get the record to stop
Breakin the habit is impossible, what happened to Tak?
He's unleashed, he's a beast so Sledge hand me a block
Partyin, what's your corpses posin for? The camera was shot
Huh, Styles and Machine Shop, necklace fly
No wonder everybody's so petrified 
I said - Styles and Machine Shop, necklace fly
No wonder everybody's so petrified

Let me hear that?</pre>
