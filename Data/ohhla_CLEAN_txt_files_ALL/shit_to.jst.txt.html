Typed by: Cno Evil

[Intro: King Just]
Killah Hill status, we bout to go n on em
We bout to go n on em

[Chorus 2X: King Just]
You got to hustle when you struggle, got to struggle when you right
Keep ya mind on your money, everything will be alright
Got to know when to pull, and I got nowhere to go
Ain't a funny thing about it, I ain't got shit to show

[King Just]
That's all I can stand, and I can't stands no more
About to kick the hinges off the industry door
All's fair, love &amp; war, especially with the in-laws
Yours be back from the fucking hog jaw
Hardcore flavor hang out, the liquor store
Metaphors ran ya'll niggas like minotaurs
Editors want a copy on front page
Starting riots, cuz the mayor do it on stage
Blaze like a magazine or Johnny Cash
If the real don't get on, how long will it last
Personal, nah man, I got a vendetta
Way before Milk D copped his first Jetta
A letter to the better, ask Masta Ace
It be a Chainsaw Massacre like Leatherface
Yo, sick ass bass, who rock in the staircase
And left niggas dazed like the trees was laced
Get a taste of the exclu', new from Who You
Fuck you, and whatever's got to do
Ran through every project, I proside
Can still that ain't loose, don't knock the muthafucker rock it
A dangerous mind, before ya crew was thought about
Watch what you say you might get punched in the mouth
Turn out, every fucking jam that I slam
The Mizza, short for the muthafucking man
Mother, may I, yes you can
KJ, I hold you up, just like a kickstand
Banned in the USA, I'm a wolf, so much it gray
And still take like Parle

[Chorus 2X]

[King Just]
A straight smash to any MC who think he lasting
He think he high post, cuz he high fashion
I ain't asking, man, I do what I gotta
Take KJ out? It'll take a whole lotta
MC's to step in my path and build my wrath
We can meet on Soulful Court or Park Hill Ave.
And crash like the ram on the Mountain Drew commercial
You need to start walking like Urkel
My studio was Universal, after that, it's Galactic
Horror tactics, don't get it backwards
K put the C in the Carter, and serious like your fucking father
Nigga, don't bother, the archer
Bow and arrows sparrow, brunette like Carol
I told them telling ass niggas to tattle
They don't wanna battle, they seen what I did to they idol
Standing in the corner all spiteful

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
