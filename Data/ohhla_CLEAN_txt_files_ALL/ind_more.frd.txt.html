Song:   I Need More
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I gotta get it, I gotta get it
I gotta get it, I gotta get it

[Chorus]
Got a couple plugs but I think I need more
Think I need more, think I need more
All these bricks coming in
But I need more, but I need more
All these bitches on my dick
But I think I need more
Think I need more, think I need more
Got a lot of money but I think I need more
Think I need more, think I need more

[Verse 1]
Bill g, gbe that's how we stunt them bricks
Got columbian, jamaican plugs and I know mexicans
Fredo ricksy they on system, forth I fuck with sosa them
Every month on the 24th I get some more of them
Truck loads of them bricks and bells took up all of it
I put my name off a clientelle, that black amigo shit
I was list for 4 rounds, I was street profit
I got 5 different plugs, that's a lot of profit
If a plug bring problem, you know I could handle it
I robbed a lot of plugs, they known for snitching in the end
So when I need some bricks, I just make some more of them
300 glory boys, black amigo balling

[Chorus]
Got a couple plugs but I think I need more
Think I need more, think I need more
All these bricks coming in
But I need more, but I need more
All these bitches on my dick
But I think I need more
Think I need more, think I need more
Got a lot of money but I think I need more
Think I need more, think I need more

[Verse 2]
Gotta get this money so you know I'm trappin stupid hard
Don't give a fuck who you are, serve to your mobs
I need that diamond, the trap we taking chains too
Turn your ass around, you look suspicious, we ain't serving you
Scooter bring that vet out, we ran around with that tek out
Fuck niggas stretched out on the concrete with they chest out
Hunned killers when I step out, hunned grand in my safe house
Killers with me, they safe out
Kick the door really safe out

[Chorus]
Got a couple plugs but I think I need more
Think I need more, think I need more
All these bricks coming in
But I need more, but I need more
All these bitches on my dick
But I think I need more
Think I need more, think I need more
Got a lot of money but I think I need more
Think I need more, think I need more</pre>
