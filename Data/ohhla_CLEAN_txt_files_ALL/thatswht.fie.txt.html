(*talking*) 
Yeah, Cooler B, Untouchable 
Beeno, Kevin Baily, I love being a survivor feel me 
Yeah that new Fiend shit, get with me 
Papa Jones T, MH 

[Fiend] 
I started out, the baddest motherfucker alive 
Now for my spot, all these lil' niggaz want me to die 
Unlike telephones, can't kill my connects 
In these streets on the sets, in your hood in these 'jects 
It's the heart of the lion, that make me cock my shit and get to firing 
I'm a survivor, if you get to classifying 
Blood on my sneakers, niggaz moving drugs from the people 
Whenever I was spoon cooking, like Anitas 
What you need cheebah reefer, or nigga seekers 
Got wolves that'll kill they own, if the thicker sweeter 
Black crack in the beaker, ain't no cock but keep a heater 
Most are throw aways, snitch are relievers 
This is where we at, and I suggest you know your environment 
Cause soon as you exhale smoke, that you can die in it 
And my heart, got some'ing that yours lack 
Plus a hundred different guns on the rack, yeah 

[Chorus] 
That's what you want, my gun in your face your neck in a brace 
Your life erased, from that new thang up out that case 

That's what you want, my gun in your face your neck in a brace 
Your life erased, from that new thang up out that case 

That's what you want, my gun in your face your neck in a brace 
Your life erased, from that new thang up out that case 
That's what happens, when you playing round 
Playing round, then your ass gon' be staying round 

[Fiend] 
Some call it, murder by numbers 
I saw it that's what happen when you slumber, never encounter a New Orleans summer 
The city that care forgotten, like New York's apple where it's rotten 
Where there's plenty plotting, rifles stay restocked in 
Where the junkies score the bass, and rocks in 
Protect yourself, you shooting three's like John Stockton 
And everybody temperamental, off these instrumentals 
Cross the line, and your life's the incidentals 
And I know that the streets ain't safe, and I don't wanna be a goner 
But he bragging on three hundred pounds, of that California 
This is my life, and my surroundings 
Read between the lines, and think we clowning 

[Chorus] 

[Fiend] 
Shotgun shells, yells of smells of burnt flesh 
Passing out, from the sight of the mess 
It ain't new to me, most of these visuals glued to me 
Nothing movie theater, or news to me 
Random do I cry on a lost life, whether she slain from a knife 
Begging and screaming forgiveness, to Christ 
It's trifling when I close my eyes, expose and roll the 4-5 
And watch a man, slow die 
Get your profits pack your rockets, count your cheddar 
Be bout whatever, don't be caught without your metal 
Cause when it came from concrete, I be damned if some how gon' get me 
Return to find, snap your bone grizzly yeah 

[Chorus - 2x]</pre>
