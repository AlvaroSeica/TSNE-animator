[Hodgy Beats]
My amnesia cause me to sip NyQuil
and sleep in the mornin, forgettin how my nights feel
Niggaz nosey, I wonder how Mike feel
after the fix-up, hopin Venice might heel
Banana clips might peel if situations heavy
Dumpin out the Bentley Azure instead of Chevys
Battery mentality, I'm +Everready+
You're the opposite of me motherfucker you never-ready
I gas up on my wagon 'til my whip full
Keep the hip tool, a/k/a pis-tol
Diamonds by the diamond to keep the wrist cool
I stand tall while y'all posin niggaz sit, stool
Flights overnight, constantly on the move
Real niggaz don't jerk, real niggaz we groove
Real niggaz don't hurt, lil' homey we do
what we gotta do to get ourselves at the plot
The plant gets moved when it's too big for the pot
I'm a G, so I know how to hit the right spot
When they're tied up, I can untangle any knot
Girls ride my coaster like I'm a ride at Knotts
Black dude, black car with the black socks
The reason they down my race is because, black rocks
Ock, I hope you understand English
Whoever made slang is a muh'fuckin genius
Call me Captain Hook, and get hooked
if you relax, one gram of me'll make you relapse
If you try to sleep, take a free nap
I'm allergic to the world, how the fuck I'ma react?
I don't know...</pre>
