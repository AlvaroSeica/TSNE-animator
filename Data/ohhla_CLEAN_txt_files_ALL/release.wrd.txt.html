[Werd]
Yeah 
Werd SOS
Feel like I'm locked up up here
What these are mixtapes
What ken I need a release date
I know your waiting

(I know) I know your waiting for weeks mate
It's like I get no release date
My release mate is on beats mate
Even if I get no release date [x2]

Shit see its hard when your struggling 
Own own publishing but sitting in the pub again
Thinking that better off off with your mug and pen
Rather then taking out a blade and just mugging them
No thuging ken ken man a fucking ken
Look for relief with a beat and a fucking pen
Then nothing really happens
Your locked in a room cause they dont like the accent
No acting or faking my actions
Stop giving tips was it like I was asking
(Nah) take your feedback and eat that
Keep back keep that right in your heid twat
Next time you write a rhyme you can beat that
And if not fuck off go and take your seat back
See its just a game
Your sounding the same and I'm sounding insane

(I know) I Know your waiting for weeks mate
Its like I get no release date
My release mate is on beats mate
Even if I get no release date [x2]

I rapped as an infant my natural instinct
To ink things instant making an imprint
For instance I started looking at big things
Only to notice that I might as well lip sync
Dont want to hear what I got to say (no)
Think I'm crazy because I rap this way (yes)
Well OK I'm no cashing the bills
See I flow pretty good with no marketing skills
(Nah nil) Though I do flow ill
I'm sick to the stomach no cup half filled
See its empty theres plenty I need fulfilled
You dont ken me a bet you think of bills
But no no I'm no in it for the cash man
Like Pac man nah I'm like Pacman
Eating up the game pure balls but I'm back and
Thats where I bin bin binned like a trash can

(I know) I Know your waiting for weeks mate
Its like I get no release date
My release mate is on beats mate
Even if I get no release date [x2]

See I'm older my hearts got colder
Girl called fame do you think I can hold her
Mold her get her to try and move boulders
Blocking my path on life roller coaster
(Coaster, coaster) Yeah get your drink on
Look at clubs and pubs aint shit on
(Nah) Just a bunch of fake guys with the bling on
Doing a two step two steps fae a sing song
And it's oh so stressful
Build up build up oh so suspenseful
On instrumentals I'm instrumental
But get nowhere with the pen or the pencil
Mental need to speak gentle
I dont slag the scene but its not very helpfully
Nah I just do it for release
I feel allot better with my speech 
Peace

(I know) I know your waiting for weeks mate
It's like I get no release date
My release mate is on beats mate
Even if I get no release date [x2]

Naw get no release date
Just get no release date
This is my release mate
Shout out Bill on the beat</pre>
