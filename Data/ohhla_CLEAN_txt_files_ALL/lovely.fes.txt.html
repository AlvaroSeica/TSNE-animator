[Chorus: sample (Fes Taylor)]
(Love me, love me, love me...)
That's all I ask girl, yeah
(Love me, love me, love me...)
That's all I ask

[Fes Taylor]
I really do love you, cuz you the only one who
Was there for me, cared for me, and kept it true, boo
I'm so glad that we got together
I feel sad when we not together, writing these love letters
Express the way I feel, love hurt, make my heart bleed
And it won't heal, this envelope sealed with lots of love
Lots of hugs, lots of kisses, be mines, I grant you a lifetime of wishes
We can make babies, build a family, they call ours
Or make love, early morning, the shower
Wake up, in my arms, holding you tight, it feels so right
That's why I'm devoting my life
To making you happy, making you smile, so love
We can't give up, ma, we made it til now
Since 3/24/99, day that we met
In front of your school, in the GS Lex
Hi, my name Fes, baby girl, you the only one
Worthy of my last name in this whole wide world
Now, who better for you, than me, give you the title Ms. Reed
Husband and wife, we soon to be
Thank you for making me feel, the way that you do
So don't worry bout me cheating, girl, I save it for you
I'm all yours, tired of being a dog, on all fours
Giving up the game, baby girl, you're the cause
Found what I'm looking for, searched no further
Sorry for the wrong I did, sorry I hurt ya
Think of me and you, you can't hold back to laugh
Regardless of the bad times, had fun in the past, girl...

[Chorus]

[Fes Taylor]
Girl, I treat you like a queen, all I ask
We do it fifty/fifty, meet somewhere in between...</pre>
