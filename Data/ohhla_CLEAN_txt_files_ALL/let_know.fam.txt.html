(*Intro*)
Roll up the dro, po' up the fo'
Calling all my thug niggaz, time to hit the flo' 

[Hook]
Roll up the dro, po' up the fo'
Calling all my thug niggaz, time to hit the flo' let em know
You bout your bidness, and you ain't gon play
(let em know), you out the gutter and you come up handling weight
(let em know), see it's whatever man plexing never settles man
(let em know), get on our level man we up out the ghetto man

[D-Gotti]
Off top, I came from the block
I came with a glock, so don't get body rocked
Got it hot yes sir, blowing on the best sir
And your girl on my thang, cause I beat it up on the dresser
Mitchell &amp; Ness sir, man I'm throwback
On this dro from Afghan', trying to get blow back
True mack's wrecking I, sex with dime sexes
Guys spitting flows hitting hoes, this is what we specialize
Supersize rizzel, baby mama fill'l
He po'd up and thoed her, and he still wanna spill him but he gon

[Hook]
Roll up the dro, po' up the fo'
Calling all my thug niggaz, time to hit the flo' let em know
If you ain't fronting, and you keep it one hundred
(let em know), you getting money playboy you ain't stunting
(let em know), you grinding with it and you pay your own dues
(let em know), do your dirty work and don't leave clues

[A3]
I kick in the do', said it before
Piece around my neck, colder than a block of snow
Got my hand on my grain, a playa like to swang
I'ma do the damn thang, cause I'm thoed in the game
Choo-choo where the train, I don't know but I'm the tanker
All day everyday, gotta keep it gangsta
Pull up to the club, on some oversized dubs
Got purple marinated, moving like a slug
I'm a playa, holding it down a heavyweighter
Where my hustlers if you hear me, all across the equator then

[Hook]
Roll up the dro, po' up the fo'
Calling all my thug niggaz, time to hit the flo' let em know
If you thugging, and you all about your do'
(let em know), if you playa and you ain't tripping on no hoe
(let em know), if you hood and you represent it good
(let em know), if you real make the point understood

[D-Reck]
I'm gon let them boys know, when I step up in the do'
I done valeted the car, and now it's all systems go
There go D-Reck, see he CEO
The streets show respect, cause they see he know
How to get that do', how to whip that snow
How to ship that dro, grip the calico
Let's get this shit right, we gon burn all night
We gon thug it in the club, till they turn on the lights
If you love it man say it, tell the DJ man play it
All my Dirty 3rd gangstas, go on wreck it and display it let's

[Hook]
Roll up the dro, po' up the fo'
Calling all my thug niggaz, time to hit the flo' let em know
You fetch your feddy, by any means necessary
(let em know), it's cash first all else is secondary
(let em know), just scream if you bout cream like Ben &amp; Jerry
(let em know), you trying to make it quick fast and in a hurry

[Dirty $]
Life's a hundred yard dash, until away from the block
Waiting for the starting gun to pop, then the first is that shot
As long as my cash quat, any season it drop
Boys wanna hate, give him a reason when I hide the top
I make em stop drop and roll, swanging elbows
Crawling down candy, creature feature's exposed
On that Southside, we slide down and swang wide
And I'm thoed gripping grain, sitting on that buck hide
When I glide down, I'm just another gutter guy
Looking fly on that butter, so I guess I'm butterfly now

[Hook]
Roll up the dro, po' up the fo'
Calling all my thug niggaz, time to hit the flo' let em know
We thoed swanging, bounce and turn
(let em know), with a big muddy cup and a ounce to burn
(let em know), we thoed swanging bounce and turn
(let em know), with a big muddy cup and a ounce to burn

(*outro*)
We thoed, swanging bounce and turn
With a big muddy cup, and a ounce to burn - 2x
We thoed, let em know</pre>
