Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro]
I don't really care what everybody gotta say (oh no I don't)
I don't really care what everybody gotta say (oh no I don't, no I don't)

[Verse 1]
I don't really care what everybody gotta say
Bitches tellin me that they love me, they be lyin to my face
That's the price you gotta pay you wanna live the life of fame
It's that life that's for forever, I don't know no other way
I don't really care what everybody tryna do
I've been on my own shit and stayin loyal to the crew
Gotta ride it, damn bitch you stayin loyal to this dick
She know I be workin hard and I ain't comin home til 6
Baby God is my witness, I'm a die before I flee away
Too much drive, better click, you see me dead
While I light another I'll of that fire straight from hell
I just need a little time but they never made it up

[Chorus]
I don't really care what everybody gotta say
I hear em talkin but they ain't sayin nothing no
I don't really care what everybody gotta say
Cus we lovin and hatin and we changing every day so don't
Believe what they tell you, don't
Believe what they say, don't
Believe what they tell you, don't
Don't believe, don't believe what they say

[Verse 2]
I said I ain't really trippin on how everybody move
Ridin in my own lane, feelin like I got the juice
Tell the truth, I jug, I'm allergic to the fame
Never ever gave a fuck they used to say I was
I'm still ridin round with my middle finger up
Top down on a girl, put them titties in the air
See you lookin at me now like that nigga got a nerve
I don't worry, keep sippin what you want to
And bust down to the ground
I've been bustin my balls tryna put on for my town
Yea I go work in the town, put that foul on my vouch
But the judge man can try, don't nobody make a sound

[Chorus]
I don't really care what everybody gotta say
I hear em talkin but they ain't sayin nothing no
I don't really care what everybody gotta say
Cus we lovin and hatin and we changing every day so don't
Believe what they tell you, don't
Believe what they say, don't
Believe what they tell you, don't
Don't believe, don't believe what they say

[Outro]
I don't really care what everybody gotta say (oh no I don't)
I don't really care what everybody gotta say (oh no I don't, no I don't)</pre>
