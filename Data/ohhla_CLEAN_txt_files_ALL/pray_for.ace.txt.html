Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro]
Paranoid going through it Oh Lord! Somebody pray for me please somebody amen somebody

[Chorus]
Somebody pray for me somebody pray for me
ain't got no fucking mind somebody help me please
them niggas still snitching no common loyalty
boy I'm so stressed out too many lawyer fees
somebody pray for me somebody pray for me
them pussy niggas mad they filled with jealousy
I got that problem solver now where my enemies
somebody pray for me somebody pray for me

[Verse 1]
I think I'm going crazy I think I lost my mind
feel like the feds watching I think they tapped my line
I'm going through paranoia just paid another lawyer
got to keep the devil off me I need some holy water
Lord somebody pray for me somebody pray for me
I got so much money bitch I can't go to sleep
I lost my granny Georgia oh may she rest in peace
I took a bunch of diamonds put 'em in my Jesus piece
I'm sick and tired of crying all my niggas in the city
dying either that or prison cells they doing so much time
I just won't ever get it that clip gonna come extended
the last nigga threatened mine I swear he end up missing

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I'm calling out to God I hope he get the message
just bought a brand new choppa run up and you'll regret it
my baby momma tripping that shit gonna have me stressing
that money bring you haters but still know it's a blessing
somebody pray for me somebody pray for me
just 'cause I'm in the 'rari police wanna fuck with me
they think I'm selling dope my neck a half a key
my bitch is bad as hell she come from overseas
this world is going crazy the streets is getting worser
don't wanna get caught without it that's why I keep my burner
oh please forgive me father the type to never bother you
try my mother sister daughter you won't see tomorrow

[Chorus]

Lord Lord somebody pray for me somebody somebody oh Lord!</pre>
