[Asheru]
Niggas, niggas, niggas
(This is insomnia)
Niggas, let me tell y'all 'bout some niggas

Niggas are living contradictions
Niggas stick to their convictions
Niggas fall prey to addictions
Niggas are full of unfulfilled ambitions
And some niggas are just full of shit
Always talking' about what they Â‘bout to do or trying to get
Niggas know a lot, they just ain't applying it yet
See niggas wax and wane
Niggas love to complain
Niggas love to hear themselves talk, but hate to explain
Some are trained to love outwardly and hate within
Desire what they can't have, give away what they can
Niggas are so superstitious, yet they claim to know God
And they live simple lives, and they think it's so hard
Niggas love being another man's judge and jury
Niggas love to be late, niggas hate to be hurried
Niggas procrastinate 'til it's time to worry
That's why when niggas get backed into a corner they to throw flurries

But I love niggas...
(While you were sleeping)
Niggas embody the truth, the good, bad, and the ugly

But niggas are beautiful too
Niggas live lives as kings born of queens
Who never taught them what their reign means
But niggas are learning, niggas are building
Niggas are finding their place at they own pace
Niggas are having children
Making symbolic unions with worthy women
Progenitors of the dream soon to be deferred no more
The encore to our suffering from our elders' pain
They will reclaim our glory and continue our original story
As it was in the beginning is now, and forever will be, the nigga in me</pre>
