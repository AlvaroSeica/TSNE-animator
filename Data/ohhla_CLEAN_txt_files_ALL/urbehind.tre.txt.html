[Trey Songz]
So unusual to me
How I can see
That thang you got
From the the back
To the front
So beautiful to me
Girl you see
This dream I got
You'd be walking all through
The way you do it

[Chorus]
Shorty I want you so so bad
You running through my mind
All I see your behind
Shorty I want you so so bad
You running through my mind
All I see your behind

[Trey Songz]
And all I see
Is you on top of me
Watching you ride
Looking to my eyes
All I need is to be inside
I'll be sliding in the front
Going to the behind

[Chorus]

[Birdman]
Ay that girl so big
Ay that girl so fat
Ay that girl so big
Ay that girl so fat
Why is your back bone bigger that the usual
Little mama why you so phat
How long did it take that thang to grow
I'd love to hit that front the back
Me and my cut cuts
You and your gut guts
Girl move your butt butt
Diggin your gut guts
And you already-dy
Sit down on hands and knees

[Chorus] - 1.5X</pre>
