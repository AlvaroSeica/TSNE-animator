Chorus (Dre B):

You've been lookin' for the right man huh?
somebody who could understand your pain
your friends sayin' every man's the same
but you just won't believe it baby
'cause you hope one day, you pray
that he'll sweep you off your feet
as soon as you meet
so you can tell 'em please rescue me
and he'll tell you, you ain't gotta cry no more
no baby you ain't gotta cry no more
and he'll tell you, you ain't gotta cry no more
no girl you ain't gotta cry no more
and he'll tell you, you ain't gotta cry no more
no baby you ain't gotta cry no more
and he'll tell you, you ain't gotta cry no more
but deep inside you just won't believe it baby

Verse 1 (Cristiles):

they treat you like you nothin' huh?
and when you need someone to lean o n
they tell you you ain't tough enough
but nobody even knows what you've been through
bitches callin' you names and no one defends you
you just wanna let it out but they won't hear you
you keep screamin' but when nobody near you
'cause you don't wanna be judged, you keep it a secret
lookin' for the man you could trust so he keeps it
but every man that you meet on that weak shit
usin' it against you. tell you that they leavin'
you want him to accept you, want him to look past it
but how he gon' respect you if all you do is ask 'em
to stay with you forever when he don't even want that
you lettin' men play you, headin' down the wrong path
want a man to save you but how you gon' find 'em
you pushin' him away when you don't put it behind you

Chorus (Dre B):

You've been lookin' for the right man huh?
somebody who could understand your pain
your friends sayin' every man's the same
but you just won't believe it baby
'cause you hope one day, you pray
that he'll sweep you off your feet
as soon as you meet
so you can tell 'em please rescue me
and he'll tell you, you ain't gotta cry no more
no baby you ain't gotta cry no more
and he'll tell you, you ain't gotta cry no more
no girl you ain't gotta cry no more
and he'll tell you, you ain't gotta cry no more
no baby you ain't gotta cry no more
and he'll tell you, you ain't gotta cry no more
but deep inside you just won't believe it baby

Verse 2 (Cristiles):

Let him defeat you, every time he beats you
you puttin' up a wall and pretendin' it ain't see through
you gotta learn to crawl 'fo you start tryna run
so instead of startin' small now you tryna find a gun
what that gon' solve? put that blade down
you ain't gotta kill him girl he ain't finna stay 'round
you just gotta leave him baby you don't gotta plan an escape
what's the guilt for? you ain't never planned to be raped
wastin' your time with another guy, wasted another try
life ain't a lullaby, called you his wife, just another lie
sharper than a knife is the pain as you cry for another night
prayin' for another life, prayin' for an answer
took your soul hostage, holdin' it for ransom
everytime they hurt you, you gave 'em the chance to
but you deserve better, someone who understands you

Chorus (Dre B):

You've been lookin' for the right man huh?
somebody who could understand your pain
your friends sayin' every man's the same
but you just won't believe it baby
'cause you hope one day, you pray
that he'll sweep you off your feet
as soon as you meet
so you can tell 'em please rescue me
and he'll tell you, you ain't gotta cry no more
no baby you ain't gotta cry no more
and he'll tell you, you ain't gotta cry no more
no girl you ain't gotta cry no more
and he'll tell you, you ain't gotta cry no more
no baby you ain't gotta cry no more
and he'll tell you, you ain't gotta cry no more
and deep inside you finally believe it baby

Outro (Dre B):

Tell 'em rescue me
Tell 'em rescue me
Tell 'em rescue me
'cause you've been lookin' for the right man
Tell 'em rescue me
Tell 'em rescue me
who could understand
somebody who could understand your pain
your friends sayin' every man's the same
but you just won't believe it baby
'cause you hope one day, you pray
that he'll sweep you off your feet
as soon as you meet
so you could tell 'em please rescue me</pre>
