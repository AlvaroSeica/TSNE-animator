[Intro: Dom Pachino]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, what?
Yeah, uh, uh, uh, criminal shit
Talk to 'em, nigga, talk to your man real quick, man
Before I smack the shit out of him, man
For real, yo, yo, yo

[Dom Pachino]
Aiyo, move like a ninja, rule like a winner
King of your center, roll with the soul that be cold as December
Roll with the same goals as a go getta, thinking they no better
Move with persistance, create my existence
Do alotta shows to promote my flow's wicked
Rep P.R. like a young lord, that's the ticket
Ill representer, militant re-inventor man
Look at the temperature, spot got hot, when I step in here
Look how he reppin' that Staten Island rap
Got this bitch all packed, that Latin cat
Got the shit on smash

[Islord]
Aiyo, I shoot my darts at you, son, now you like
What the fuck is going on, what the fuck I done did
Common sense should of told your ass, nigga, you done fucked with the wrong kid
That nigga Islord, son, is off the meter
The God style's hot like a heater
Quick to burn ya, uh, toss and turn ya, uh
Have ya ass well done on both sides
Like some steak and fries, cuz I give it to ya early morning
Everyday with no delay, cuz I'm always on time with it, crazy fly with it
When I rhyme with it, that be me
The muthafucking I-S-L to the muthafuckin' O-R-D
In the house with the God Dom P.

[Chorus 2X: Dom Pachino, Islord]
Pump up your fist and represent this
Red hot Napalm, militant shit
Black boots, camouflage, with tanks and shit
Five star generals with ranks and shit</pre>
