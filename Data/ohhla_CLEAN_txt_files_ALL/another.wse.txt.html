[Intro] [Wise Intelligent talking]
Yo feel that. That piano is good
This is it right here DJ. This is it

[Chorus]
If I had another chance at life
I'd try to tell you that the things we had were right
If I had another chance at life
I'd try to tell you that the things we had were right

[Verse One]
Look, if Timothy Taylor was given
A chance to do it again 
I, would probably change a few things
I'd listen to me a bit more
I'd travel the world with +Three Brides+
No hate, to each his own
My world would no longer be Wise
You'd call me Jesus Jones
Pop off the hammer for Jers
Return of a prodigal son
Go tell your favorite MCs to give him his style back
Here he comes
If Timothy Taylor was given
One chance to spit it again he
Would rinse it until it's empty
Lock up to the track like Cythie
Black youth would come to the forefront 
Hip hop would feed the masses
No weapon formed against us
Would prosper or harass us
I'd educate your babies
I'd teach black men to raise them
I'd civilize your ladies
I'd be +Captain-Save-A-Hoe+
If Timothy Taylor was given
A second chance at life
I'd tell Shaheed and Culture
That what we had was right
I wouldn't have let my sister
Be murdered on the train tracks
I wouldn't have watched my old earth expire in the projects

[Chorus]
If I had another chance at life
I'd try to tell you that the things we had were right
If I had another chance at life
I'd try to tell you that the things we had were right

[Verse Two]
Yo, if Wise Intelligent was given
One chance to make it whole
I'd buy back all your souls
I'd give you crowns of life
I'd bulldoze all the projects
I'd build ghettos of grandeur
Let Jadakiss ask +Why+
I'm here to provide the answers
No longer a need for black folk
See physical labor's cheap
Job market on the constant decline
They movin' 'em overseas
Get money then out of the ghetto
Pitch coke like that, get fame
No love for the poverty stricken 
You clique up inform the game
Is Wise Intelligent was given
A second chance to say this
I wouldn't water it down to compliment your radio play list
I learned the hard way
There's no such thing as bad broadcasters
They're simply puppets at the mercy of their slave masters
Whatever you think, believe in
Becomes the world around you
Poor people think abundance
Riches will soon surround you
If Wise Intelligent was given
A chance to do it again
I'd think the thoughts of prophets/profits
I'd rid the world of sin

[Chorus]
If I had another chance at life
I'd try to tell you that the things we had were right
If I had another chance at life
I'd try to tell you that the things we had were right

[Verse Three]
There's
No longer a need for rappers
Jesus Jones has entered the building
That certain way you feelin' 
'Bout what I be talkin' 'bout
Talkin' shit while I'm walkin' out
Never let hate control your thinkin'
I'm he who speaks believin'
Who hip hop fans are seekin'
If Timothy Taylor was given
A second chance at life
I, would probably not even rap
I'd open up school abroad
If Wise Intelligent was blessed with
Another chance to live
I, would live for the love of the people
A little bit closer to God
I'd bind the broken hearted
Free the captive, touch the blind
Crush the grapes, say the grace and prepare the wine
Forgive the sins of our fathers
For which we suffer today
Return the sons of mothers who mourn for 
Watch the Donnelly (projects) pay
I'd organize the gangs
I'd give them the knowledge and know how
I'd do this like Reginald Lewis
I'd teach them never to buy out
I'd give them a love for self
I'd wrestle with Hell to be right
If Timothy Taylor was given
Another chance at life

[Chorus]
If I had another chance at life
I'd try to tell you that the things we had were right
If I had another chance at life
I'd try to tell you that the things we had were right</pre>
