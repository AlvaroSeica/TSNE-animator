Geah. Wutup? The Compton phsyco is back
Here goes something for the niggas

Listen up mutherfuckers cause its hard times
MC Eiht comin back with the hard rhymes. Geah
So bring your pen and pad and start learnin
And sit your ass down for the Eiht root sermon
You know the hard life comes livin with livin in the ghetto
Nigga hello, don't be shakey like Jello
And you better know where your from
Or you might catch the blast to your sorry ass. Geah
And the gang bangin done got me in the slum
So I gotta be with it, fuck the dumb
Down for the hood, holdin my own
livin it up cause one day I'll be gone. Geah
Now the shit done hit the fan
14 year old nigga headed for the can
Blame it on the world, because everybodies buggin
Can I get help because a niggas strugglin

17 years old kinda crazy
Heard my little freak is pregnant with a baby
So now I gotta pay, and no time to play
cause the mutherfuckin stork is on his way
Hey, nigga give up your shit
and don't be a hero, cause fool I aint havin it
One more point that got scored
cause lettin you slide I just cant afford. Geah
Just like cats and dogs when it rains
another jacked is the snaps that I gain
So I rush you, quick on the blind side
Better take cover when Eiht starts to hoo-ride
No where to run so you stand and fight
As I macks your ass once good night
A nigga like me 'll keep muggin
Can I get help cause a nigga strugglin

I guess its back to the same old shit
Grab the gat then I make another hit
beggin just aint friendly
can't get a job at motherfuckin Wendy's
Gotta go out and test my skills
A brother gotta kill to bring home the bills
It aint the way I was born, the way I grew up
To gets whats yours and dont even give a fuck
So nigga gimme whats mines and get on
Punk you know the routine its the same ass song
So don't slip fool or get caught
Riggedy-raised in Compton was the way the Eiht was taught
Gettin my propers, beatin the coppers
This brother gotta have the ends I wont stop the
Puttin in mutherfuckin work
I gotta have the ends cause I'm down for the dirt
Cause a niggas strugglin

Geah, thats how it go down, y'knowutumsayin?
Niggas strugglin, cant get none. Cant get over. Damn.</pre>
