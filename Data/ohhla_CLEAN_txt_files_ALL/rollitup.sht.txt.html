[Intro]
Okay, okay, okay
Okay, I'm gettin high man
What? Okay, okay
Got to get fly man
What? Woo
C'mon, I'm gettin high man
Okay, okay, okay okay

[Verse One]
Yeah, the Shot about to smoke again
I know, I know I know I know just what you wonderin
Why you, why you gotta rap about bein blowed so much
Then you go and spend your last end on gettin a blunt?
Man, this shit been gettin on my fuckin nerves
before I choke this so I'm just gon' go and blow some herb
See I, be high to get away from all these fuckin birds
Me eyes, be found without these jackers or these fuckin herbs
Get it, split it, fill it, lit it then let it go
Man I don't pass no mo', I take it to the fuckin dome
Fillin Swishers man, I even hit the bong
Dealin with this daily bullshit, got me up in the zone

[Chorus]
Dealin with this broke shit I'm broke and I gots to roll it up
Feelin like I'm losin my focus, I gots to roll it up
Dealin with these niggaz &amp; bitches man I quick roll it up
Now you know, now you know, now you know why I roll it up

[LongShot]
(Now you know, now you know, why I roll it up)
Yeah, it's LongShot
So next time you see me with a fuckin blunt
Man don't ask me why muh'fucker, c'mon

[Chorus]

[LongShot]
(Now you know, now you know, why I roll it up)
