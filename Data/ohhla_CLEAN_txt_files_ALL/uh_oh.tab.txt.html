[Intro: Jean Grae]
That is great
Good for you! Okay, get out of the way though
Ehehe, thank you
Excuse me, excuse me

[Jean Grae]
Been a long time (yes) shouldn't have left you
Without a dope beat to step to
Say - uhh, shouldn't have left you
without a dope beat to step to, sayin
(UH OH! UH OH! UH OH!) C'mon, the word is back
(UH OH! UH OH! UH OH!) Yeah, y'know you heard of that
(UH OH! UH OH! UH OH!) Ohh! Uh, you know the word is back
(UH OH! UH OH! UH OH!) Yes, I know you heard of that

Psychopath, ride a tricycle in a biker's club
Mike Tyson face tatted addict, like it tough
Hey scatterbrain, don't get your grey matter punched up
'til you hunched, talk-talkin like you punch drunk
One love - two maybe if I'm drunk enough
Naked watchin three, painted ladies do the bump and grub
Mean muggin Jean - the Heebs call meshugenah
Bookin her in the Catskills like "Look at her rap skills!"
He's rockin a backpack, a nerd in the rat pack
Jean Martine de Begerac, you heard of her murder rap
I murder rap, you learn it, confirm it and burn its audio
Music for your convertible, music for burnin cardio~!
Don't use it for burners - they'll find me in your stereo
and blame me for the murder sock me up and get me carried off
I know I said murder befo' - murder murder, FUCK IT murder
Make it fo', insert a learning curve
Mine is so high you get vertigo, assertive girl a-fern to blow
Eternally superlative, blindfolded learn to drive
at night up on a girder bridge, heard a "NO!"
Talib dirty nervousness, yes the boys are back
Oh yes the boys in black, the boy's a {motherfuckin} rap star
Teeny rock star, minus the f'real and all the cop cars
Rocks off, lock bars with the realest (hach-too) in the spot
Really y'all should get on your knees and just pray for forgiveness sayin

[Chorus: Jean Grae]
(UH OH! UH OH! UH OH!) I said the word is back
(UH OH! UH OH! UH OH!) Uh oh, you heard of that
(UH OH! UH OH! UH OH!) I said the word is back
(UH OH! UH OH! UH OH!) Uh oh you heard of that ohh
(UH OH! UH OH! UH OH!) I said uh oh
(UH OH! UH OH! UH OH!) Oh yeah you heard of that ohh
(UH OH! UH OH! UH OH!) I said uh oh
(UH OH! UH OH! UH OH!) Oh yeah you heard of that, ohhhh

[Talib Kweli]
I'm a, man of God who asked the Devil for some face time
It's shade time you never see him comin cause you fake, blind
The mainline, Bloods are wavin flags like K'Naan
The Crips throwin gang signs, the Beast in the street
there to keep like a canine, and low like the bassline
Jean and Kwe' think alike like great minds
The crown is on my head, what makes you think that you can take mine?
They know they'll never win but still they racist like a hate crime
Runnin track like Tyra in +Higher Learning+
We bleeding gasoline so we keepin the fire burnin
We speedin like Valvoline and we speak fo' a higher purpose
You believe in magazines that deliver entire sermons
Give me some Vasoline cause your shit is dryer than deserts
You never fired a weapon in your life~! So
picturin yourself as a gangster the only way that you shootin
My intelligent design is a product of evolution
Psychotic, erotic, catch phrases just to, get at your girl
Create solutions for a digital world
So baby even when I'm spittin game I'm addin on
Rappers goin hard pure for the dope, I got an acronym for Capricorn
{?} And Prepared, Rigorous, Innovative
Captivatin, Ordinary, Regular, Nigga just
throwin daily your chick goin crazy yo
Handle her like Chelsea Lately
Rockin the fresh kicks like you felt her baby
We'll wait until you done bein whack
We got every hand up from the front to the back
If you wonderin why you just dressin funny in rap
You need attention dog, there ain't no more, money in rap
So if you're mixin with GarageBand, videos on the Flip cam
I'm a big fan - you got more +Hart+ than +Bret - The Hitman+
But shit damn, it's the pinnacle, it gets no better
I'm boastin, but still stay humble
Never spinnin, I'm always coastin

[Chorus] - first half with ad libs

[Jean Grae]
(UH OH! UH OH! UH OH!) I said uh oh
(UH OH! UH OH! UH OH!) Oh yeah the word is back
(UH OH! UH OH! UH OH!) The word is back
(UH OH! UH OH! UH OH!) Yessir the word is back
