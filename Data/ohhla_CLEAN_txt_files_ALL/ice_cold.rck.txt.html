Omarion! (Rozay!)

[Rick Ross]
She fell in love with a dope boy
Black diamonds on the neck of that dope boy
Big body Benz for that dope boy
Love every tattoo on that dope boy
She sheds tears for that dope boy
Shit, it is what it is for that dope boy
Handle minor biz for that dope boy
But the reward is major, so on and so forth
She can tell you by the Greyhound
She can show you how to stay down
I can tell you 'bout to break down
VS1's all in my bitch watch face now
Straight G's for your low esteem
8 P's for the whole team
As I run away from my obituary
Walkingin the shit that'll get you buried
Miami's mine like I'm Pat Riley
Baseline shooter niggaz act wisely
Get the picture niggaz gettin richer now
Living next to bitches out on Fisher Isle
Down from Oprah, Don King, and Sosa
Come to the coca, callate la voca
They let shit slide when my nigga won't
Remember God forgives and them triggers don't

[Chorus: Omarion]
Aw baby it's just how it goes
Can't feel it but I know you know
Cause I keep it on the outside of you girl
And I keep it on the outside of you girl
And I'm reapin just what I sew
My heart's beatin but it's still stay tho-rough
And y'all waiting on the inside for me girl
And y'all waiting on the inside for me
Arms wide open
It's warm in here - arms wide open - it's warmer there
It's hotter there, but it's always fall in the cold
Arms wide open
It's warm in here - arms wide open - it's warmer there
It's hotter there, but it's always fall in the cold

[Rick Ross]
She fell in love with the lifestyle
Paper tag now her neck all iced out
Lear jets to the fights now
Belagio crap table with the dice out
Floor seats at the Heat game
Her bag twenty grand, nigga peep game
South Beach making love on the rooftop
Fuckin to the rhythm, got her singin like she Jill Scott
I'm just a +Nigga Witta Attitude+
Earning revenue through different avenues
One of my soldiers died in Attica
Anything other than a ride is out of character
Top down and it feels right
I could tell you what a dope boy feels like
I could tell you that he never sleeps
He may smile but it's never sweet
Swisher burnin at his fingertips
Tears on the inside but they never drip
God forgives and the courts don't
Seekin an appeal when the courts won't

[Chorus]</pre>
