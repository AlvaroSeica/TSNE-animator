Hey love...
Yeah...

Shopping in the city one day
On my way, met a redbone by the name of Stronjay
Five foot six, body thick, hair silky
She could make the hardest man melt and turn milky
Bugged out shit, one eye was hazel, one was blue
Lips fully packed as my attention stayed glued
Upon her outline, I cased it with my mind
Saying to myself, 'this sugar be a dime'
Yo sugar, let's have a drink, and um, talk some more
Proceed to grab my bag, and then we exit the store
Walking down the street, men is staring with amazement
Treatment something like black ???????????????
Anyhow, the star and me hit a sushi bar
Told her that I never had sushi before
Ordered saki that I already endeavored in Japan
Reached 'cross the table then I grabbed her hand
Why your man let you walk around solo like this?
My chinky eyes looked upon her as I gave her hand a kiss
This most mesmerizing young thing I must say
Echoes in my thoughts since I met you that day

Chorus:
Stronjay, a beautiful thing I must say
Her body got curves like waves in The Bay
Lips light smooth, just like Alize
The bizomb, I couldn't see her blowing my way

Stronjay responds, men only want her cuz she rich
Her beeper start buzzin' so we pullin' out a flip
In the back of my mind, I'm sayin' 'yes, go ???????'
Find a nigga rich in New York's one in a million
She wanted to leave, I said 'Is this the end?'
Then she gave me an invitation back to her crib
I never surprise, I flag a cab, she says 'un uh'
My car's round the block in the parking garage
Got the vehicle, ???? the speed like Batman out of his cave
500 Benz whippin' in the wind
Destination 57 Park Ave. south
Turn my face a little, wipe the slob from my mouth
The building was immaculate inside with marble floors
We hit the elevator, she slips out of her draws
I'm shocked like goodies and I don't know how to take 'em
Titties in my face and like a gun I must face 'em
This most mesmerizing young thing I must say
Echoes in my thoughts since I met you that day

CHORUS

Top floor, penthouse suite for sure
It was classy like some type of fly furniture store
She grabbed me up and intertwined into a kiss with me
I tried taking off my clothes, she assisted me
Upon her fireplace wall is were I pushed her back
Then on the plush floor we fell; passionate collapse
She pushed me off, but the push wasn't mean
To the fridge, and came back with strawberries and whipped cream
The scene is set, but baby not just yet
Cuz strawberries and whipped cream ain't complete without Moet
Foreplay; nibblin' my tongues in the air
Layin flat on her back, I love tappin' on the rear
Nuff time we spent gettin' excited, I'm delighted
Excstasy, I know honey-hun she won't fight it
She stands up, and lead me by my hand, we fled
Into a room with a king size canopy bed
This most mesmerizing young thing I must say
Satisfied O in like each and every way

CHORUS
