[Intro: Truck]
Alright, it's on, this bout is scheduled for one fall
Standing eight count, if you fall, you loss
Both of ya'll rap with honor, don't matter the cost
Alright, now tough mics, and ya'll get it on

[Apocalipps]
You like to talk a lot of shit, but now, I'm makin' you pay
These Mayweather hooks, that I break in your face

[Iron Mic]
Yeah, slow up your pace, punchlines makin' you daze
I go the rounds, to leave you ripped up like paper mache
Nigga you better keep your fist up, and cover you face
Cuz after this, you gettin' stitched up, I'm leavin' you maced

[Apocalipps]
Not nothing, come on fam, why you want me to break your jaw
And have you sippin' meatloaf, through a plastic straw
I suplex you hard, and straight, break your spinal
Apocalipps, I piss CDs and shit out vinyls
Come on, man, stop throwin' on weak blows, I eat those
Get at your people, desert eag' through the peephole
What, you shootin' bricks, nigga, I'm water from the free throw
We had to get it on, the street said we equal

[Iron Mic]
Man, listen, I'd rather fuck you up now, and then respect you later
You gon' have me put your mic on a respirator
When I was young, I got wicked, eight body buddies
But now my arms is so strong, they could body your buddies

[Apocalipps]
Yeah, shots through your belly, hot rocks poppin' your skelli'
The call me inf', I never fake it, I keep it gully
You couldn't touch my mic, if I gave it to you
Half these niggas know I'm not the one to play, do you?

[Iron Mic]
Listen, competition, come an go, my last vic, I bombed him
You couldn't fuck with my style, if I gave you some condoms
My rap's is sick

[Apocalipps]
Yeah, but your jab ain't shit
And I'mma weave right under it, and smash your lip

[Iron Mic]
Oh, you fuckin' daredevil, you must of drunk
You must of drunk a case of Mountain Dew
Or smoked about an ounce or two, thinkin' I won't pound on you
Well fuck you nigga

[Apocalipps]
Well fuck you too
I got a chrome four-four

[Iron Mic]
I got a nine and a rule

[Interlude: Truck]
Wait hold the fuck on, hold the fuck on
Ya'll muthafuckas better stop hittin' below the belt
Next time ya'll nigags hit below the belt
I'm kickin' ya'll the fuck out my ring
I'm takin' a point from Apocalipps, and I'm takin' a fuckin' point from Iron
Mic

[Apocalips]
Man, if you wanna fight, call Oscar De La Hoya
Cuz I handle mine, shootin' up blocks and Ford Explorers

[Iron Mic]
Yeah, but if you wanna talk, talk the prec', to the police
Cuz my semi-auto's def, and retarted for beef

[Apocalipps]
And if you wanna squash beef, cook up a burger with bread
Cuz I'm all squashin' over here duke, is legs and heads

[Iron Mic]
And if you wanna die

[Apocalipps]
Fuck, then that's my kind of talk
Let's run at each other, swingin'

[Iron Mic]
If you fall you loss

[Apocalipps]
Now what's the cost?

[Iron Mic]
For what, for a can of ass whippin' ?
Cuz that's all you gettin', my tongue and my gun spittin'

[Apocalipps]
Between my gums and rugs sippin', hopin' a fight is near
If I was Tyson, I would bite you, but I'm slice your ear

[Iron Mic]
Yeah, and I'mma play Holyfield, beat 'em twice that year

[Apocalipps]
Man, that ice grill is not yours, were'd you cop that stare?

[Iron Mic]
I got that, from my block, where I was raised for years
Laugh now, cry later, nigga, save those tears

[Apocalipps]
Man, I slay your peers, blaze their gear, whatever they wear
And you can name a time or place...

[Iron Mic]
Nigga, whatever I'm there

[Outro: Truck]
I told ya'll, no hittin' below the belt
I told ya'll that shit already
So I'mma end this shit right now
And if ya'll niggas got a problem with that
Come see me, come fuckin' fight me
I'm the king of the ring, come and fight me, muthafucka</pre>
