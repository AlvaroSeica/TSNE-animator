[Josh Osho]
Ordinary days
But these ain't ordinary times
I lost to makin waves
I know there's something on our minds
We need, something so beautiful
when you feel you're losing ground
Someone to keep you straight up tall
cause no one wants to fall, fall

[Chorus]
We all wanna be giants
but I hate to chew every form of mesh that we're in
We all wanna have patience
and we want it right now gettin tired of waitin
We all wanna make progress
and we sufferin runnin in, circles again
The only reason that I stand to make it through
is that I'm twice the man I am when I'm with you

[Josh Osho]
Tryin to make a change
Going down a different avenue
If anytime I stop
at least I know where I am heading to
So won't ya, join the revolution
cause I been missing you
'till we all know where this story goes
We're climbing up these walls, walls

[Chorus]

[Childish Gambino]
Money left to burn, we can do whatever
And you know that I'm a boss, check my Kelsey Grammer
Steak attitude but she smilin when we kiss
But I love my baby momma, cause she do not exist
Do not mess with me though, ain't fly but we know
No habla ingles knows how not to angle
I tried to get bingo, make that un poquito
I tried that with Rita and we wear Mossino
They wanna see what's up in your heart, don't start
playin Saliare on my Mozart
Shit I'ma get the bogart, with my lil' cousin
Cause life is only livin when we livin for each other

[Chorus]</pre>
