[Jazze Pha]
I need a bitch that'd eat a bitch
with decent cheeks and tits
feet and hips
and a backside
at that time she need a dick
a freaky bitch
you can eat this bitch that she can reefer with
and for the man she sleeping with
she be quick to release a fit
and be the bitch
and leave a cheek a print of a palm
a black eye
and a bleeding lip
when she see you with the bitch that eat her clit
but when it comes to treating dick
she be the bitch
she'll have you skeeting quick
and make sure that she end you teasing it
she use a whole heap of spit
she like the semen shit
she'll squeeze the tips
and hit the breast side
cause she ain't leaving shit
she like her jeans to fit
but so goddamn petite with it
the average weaker trick
will freeze her wrist
she like to tease the tricks
to make spend them their cheese
to get her niece's Bent'
so he can hit
but first and foremost
she gotta see some chicks
and in the morning I love
when she fit
yeaster bread
with cheese in it
inside a hot greasy fish
