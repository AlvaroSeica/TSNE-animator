( gillie )
yo they found me .. cut me ground me 
made me powder .. say I'm expected across seas in an hour
i was born in columbia they shippin me out 
package tight so them dogs aint sniffin me out 

( spade )
but me I aint changed I'm a household name
considered common but play a major part in the game
people keep me in cabinage, drawers and shells 
and say I do magic turn four into twelve

( gillie )
I'm transported cross borders on planes and boats
I dont know my name yet but there calln me coke
I'm usually around the waist and in the line in the coats
so they can sneak me past customs and the guards dont bust 'em
 
( spade )
and I heard about that cat called coke and I dont trust 'em
cuz all the other dudes I know be scared to touch 'em
they say he from columbia .. they want us to meet 
they must know how I react when I'm under the heat 

( chorus ) 2x
I'm the coke .. you know you cant move wit out me 
so wut .. I'm da cut you gone loose wit out me
but I'ma drug dealers dream
but I'm da one dat make the drug dealer mo' cream
nigga .. lets make a team

( gillie )
they got me in .. they passin me out, city to suburbs
state to state .. they put me on china plates
chop me up .. make me look like shake then call me weight
and now they wanna introduce me to this kid bake

( spade )
o0o you da cat coke that I heard about 
from word of mouth, put us in the pot stirred us out
I gotta admit .. man I like this guy 
they cooked us up into a pie allowed us to dry
when together we frew from 20 to 25

( gillie )
this kid bake is live .. 
now we headin to the hood 
to dem niggas on da corners dat be up to no good
this one cat .. he picked me up in a benz
he brought me, bake and like 11 of my friends 
we headed to the kitchen .. shit we at it again

( spade )
and it was magic again 
I mean we jus got larger 
I got stronger .. coke strength got smaller
put us in the hands of these niggas dey call ballas
and hustlers .. and fiends on the streets they all lustas

( chorus ) 2x

( spade )
me and dope is like brothas
( gillie )
da fiends they all loved us
( spade )
and da ghettos and the guttas
( gillie )
da east coast to the southas
( spade )
to the people dat ran this land
( gillie )
mayors and govenors 
( spade )
congressmen .. cant believe the people we knew 
( gillie )
and da hustlas they ran from the people in blue 
( spade )
u know the name, the kid bake refridgerated near you 
( gillie )
but for the love of us you see wut people will do 
they kill brothas .. aunts, uncles, neices and mothas
aint shit you can tell us
( spade )
they feel for us
( gillie )
and we manipulate minds
( spade )
and they kill for us
( gillie )
and all my thugs on the block
( spade )
they whole steal for us 
( gillie )
it might seem like a dream
but its real for us

( chorus ) 2x</pre>
