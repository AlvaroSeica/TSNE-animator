Down south is where I stay 
Switch 4 lanes 
Never the same 
From the Antwon to the MLK 
These H-Town boys like to swang and bang 
 
(Slim Thug) 
Now welcome to the city of game, piece and chains that swang 
Pop trunk and bang as I grip wood grain 
I'm bout that down-south city, where they show no pity 
Candy paint be lookin' pretty, makin' haters feel shity 
See I'ma long star balla, and a chop chop crawler 
18-year-old shot calla, and a droptop crawler 
I'm no less den da best, yes I must confess, 
And hell that sets in my chest torelive off stress 
Freshly dressed in my Guess, I gotthat Guess on my chest 
It's 3rd coast in dadoor all the rest must wreck, 
Went from'a BMX to a GS Lex, born and raised in Houston Tex 
Where we don't bar no plex 
NOW ..

Never the same (it's doin down baby)

(Mista Madd) 
Down South .. you know we real baby 
Even if we ride a Hodo or a foreign made Mercedes 
Rocks in my wrist, gat close to hip, 
just in case a hater out there gets me pissed 
Man I'm so real, man I'm so trill, 
99 I'm tryin' to get the million dollar deal 
Nice to know that I'm tryin' to have some diamonds in my grill 
And I'm breakin' boys off with my freestyle skills 
Givin' them something they can feel, man just chill 
Man what the deal with the syrup and the pill 
In the lac and cat with 18's in da trunk 
Da Alpine thump, is screwed as we bump 
TV it stay on wood with fifth wheel in the back 
With the top down I keep it hot with defined plex up in dadash 
Wearin' white socks and dem black Nike sandals 
We down-south nigga's this something yall can't handle 
Ride man I'm grippin' so much up on da freeway 
Down-south baby switchin' lanes up on da freeway 
Wouldn't give a good-goddamn about the he say, she say 
Cause when u downtown you saw me you say, "Damn he paid!" 

{*Hook*} 

(Yungstar) 
Here I come, Here I come, I know you see me comin' 
Drop my back on Antwon, pick it up on the front end 
Steady hummin' I be stuntin' like a bag of diamonds 
I be shinin' I be grindin' man wood on the vinyl 
I'm a minor, wood on the vinyl, 
Broke dem boys off cause Yungstar still a finer 
Houston's finest artist, I'm da smartest, boys get rigormortis 
I'm crawlin' real slow on 4's like a tortoise, like a toad 
I'm in da mode, feel me explode, hoppin' out my rides do's 
Dawg gots to keep it cold, I'ma toad, I'm so throwed 
I'm complete, unique from my feet from my head to my feet,something sweet

Down south is where I stay 
Switch 4 lanes (mann, hold on) 
Never the same 
From the Antwon to the MLK (DAWG, man I got this) 
These H-Town boys like to swang and bang (why am I actin'so bad) 
Down south is where I stay (one mo' time, one mo time,bring it back) 
Switch 4 lanes 
Never the same 
From the Antwon to the MLK 
These H-Town boys like to swang and bang 

(Yungstar) 
Got eleven Chevy's, I'm the rhymin' acrobatic 
Your boy he da baddest, naw I'm da maddest 
I done slipped, I done slided, hoes done got wilder 
Broke dem boys off now I'm a wood provider 
I'm in Asia, slidin' on my datons 
Boss rock and skate, got Nintendo and a Station 
Maybe Super Sega, rock like Omega 
Messin' with these boys I be ridin' with a Vega 
Comin' with a woman, real clear, all up in their ear 
Baggets and Pioneer, once a year, 
I'm bout dat Belvedere, I'm a butler, I done reached, Idone cut ya' 
Break des boys off with baggets and clusters 
Round my neck, if you disrespect grab my Teck 
And leave you wet on the set I don't expect 
Won't be da Gama I'm mo shake den ?? 
Moved to Alabama, and got silk pajamas 
Got silk sandals, I ride sled I turn their heads 
Boys get scared u better call on da FED's 
I rock u don't stop got Gucci shoes and socks 
Sowed up da block, like da Pac I won't stop 
We dangerous, dismantle, wood upon da panel 
Nike shoes, Nike sandals, light my girl with a candle,handle 
Knock on do's, do's done get froze 
As I pull out da wide body candy red low (low low low) 
Watch I roll red maybe roll blue or green I'm on the scene 
Diamond ring Byzantine, I'ma swang I'm a swanger 
Watchin' Cliffhanger, screens fall I'ma ball 
Better get the ?? chamber 
In the deck u come wreck, give me my tape deck 
Slide I'ma ride, vibe in the special effect 
Diamonds bling bling, swang and I swing 
Matchin' pinky ring, Antwon to the King 
Here I come here I come, yeah this Yungstar comin' 
Real with da woman, hear da bang think its thunder 
Naw it ain't thurder it's just me, see da candy jet ski 
Read da lights its TYP, Throwed Yung Playa 
I'm da mayor of the Himalayas 
My diamonds glare, wide body valeter 
Here he come here he ..
Mann bring it back I'm ready I'm ready</pre>
