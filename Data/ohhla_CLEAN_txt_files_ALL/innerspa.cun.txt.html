[Intro]
"There's that new girl in our math class."
   "Oh yes, she's a smart kid. Why, you know her?" 
"Not very well. I wish I did."
   "I don't know what it is, but there's something about her you like."
  "Well, she always looks nice, to start with."
"Yeah, especially when you prepare with some of the weird calclus miss"

[Deacon The Villian]
I remember as young'n, slummin with my crusaders 
Garcia Vegas, burglarizing neighbors for Segas 
Lil schemers, countin Beemers, Benzes and Acuras 
It's tough to count blessings when battlin Count Dracula 
Life's fangs'll drain yo' blood in floods 
Can't wade in that water because of rogue scuds 
Role models taught us you oughta just roll up 
In life there's no love whatever yo role was 
Find wealth, no need to find self 
Stand in line until you find your spot on a shelf 
Sold! Don't mean to sound cold
Got my soul singing baritone, feelin down low 
To think, of those in this winter with no mink 
or folk, weathering this desert with no drink 
to cope, some chain smoke with no link 
or hope, just dope, tree and a rope 

[Chorus: Deacon]
You are the living truth of life, ooh ooh 
 (The fastest can't run from who they are 
 I'd run from self but no man can run that far)
You are the living truth of life, ooh ooh 
 (The fastest can't run from who they are 
 I'd run from self but no man can run that far)

[Toby]
Turn the page, eventually I hit a certain age 
Learned that all the freedom was worthless when you're afraid 
Success can often be a perfect cage 
Searching for a way to stay the same while the world will change 
A prisoner, trapped in the regret 
Cause the ego can't keep up if they happen to reject it 
Sometimes you want so bad to be respected 
Goin after it 'til youâve left your happiness neglected 
I've seen the weakness in grown men 
Playin games with their pain, they cheat but they don't win 
Seen 'em feed the needle deep into their own skin 
Tryna find a fleeting bit of peace in that moment 
More success to fix what's left 
Take an even bigger risk like after this I'll rest 
'Til he painted with a razor on his wrist a red 
The color of lips, pucker up, it's the kiss of death 

[Natti]
I'm +Bustin' Loose+, no +Wilder+, just a prior/+Pryor+  
and that debt was paid in spades and barbed wire 
Later use eyes to weigh and move fire 
Then moved crowds in wades with hellfire 
Meet a fan, kick it witcha, take a picture 
Sign both titties and give a pound to your mister 
It's been real, realer than steel I'da grabbed 
before I picked up a pen and a pad, shit, it's been chill 
Chiller than the look in the eye 
of a junkie when heâs lookin to buy, lookin to fly 
Pyrex on the good eye of a broke stove 
Pyramid of cans, tin foil with poke holes 
Soft white girl break your nose and gets harder 
Revenge of the caine/+Kane+, the original +Get Carter+ 
Take your favorite star, make him into a martyr 
Life ain't trending, it's ending, see farther

  "Well, she always looks nice, to start with."
"Yeah, especially when you prepare with some of the weird calclus miss"
  "YOO-HOO" "Jimmy thinks she has the key to popularity, parking in cars with the boys at night"
 "When Jerry brags about taking Jimmy off, he learns that she dates all the boys and he feels less important"</pre>
