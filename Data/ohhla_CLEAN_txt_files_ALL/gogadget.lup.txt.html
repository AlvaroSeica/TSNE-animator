I'm from the city in the Midwest
best city in the whole wide-wide world, say it now
I'm from the city in the Midwest
best city in the whole wide-wide world, say it now
I'm from the city in the Midwest
best city in the whole wide-wide world, hey
City in the whole wide world, hey
City in the whole wide world, hey

I got my go go go go go go go go go go gadget flow
I got my go go go go go go go go go go gadget flow
I got my go go go go go go go go go go gadget flow
I got my go go go go go go go go go go gadget flow

I'm back I'm back
I'm cool I'm cool
West side representative
All me
No ghost no 16 bit like Sega genesis
All G-ball on the ball, Soundtrack on the track
Gemini on the job, Shayla G on the G
Sarah Green for the green, free Chilly
And I'm back on my thing for the listenersses
What you are a-bout to-to witness is
Blue and new valuable album 2
Credit for the ghetto, ghetto images

From the M-A-D-I to the S to the O-N
Potent, to get you open
Move like a nigga supposed to
Get your dough on the go with the flow
That I'm holdin

I got my go go go go go go go go go go gadget flow
I got my go go go go go go go go go go gadget flow
I got my go go go go go go go go go go gadget flow
I got my go go go go go go go go go go gadget flow

Love, got the windy city on my back
So I'm back on my grizzle like a bearskin rug
Plus I'm layin on the floor, blame it on the Go
Little rapper turn it out cause I'm very pluh
I convert I can work anywhere any word you can ask my brother huh
He'll concur, that I'm sers, spit the words with the man up above
thank you very much
That I got what I got and I'm at where I'm at like an a in a circle
with a pay little erkel
What they say when they see O.G. from the F to the F to the amazing verbals
They race in circles like they racing a gerbil
I race in a circle like I'm racing a horse
I'm racing a Porsche while they racing in place
They race in a cage, I race on a course
Course
That case in the court did not defer the dream
I am still a raisin in the sun, raging against the machine

From the M-A-D-I to the S to the O-N
Potent, to get you open
Move like a nigga supposed to
Get your dough on the go with the flow
That I'm holdin

I got my go go go go go go go go go go gadget flow
I got my go go go go go go go go go go gadget flow
I got my go go go go go go go go go go gadget flow
I got my go go go go go go go go go go gadget flow

I'm from the city in the Midwest
best city in the whole wide-wide world, say it now
I'm from the city in the Midwest
best city in the whole wide-wide world, say it now
I'm from the city in the Midwest
best city in the whole wide-wide world, hey
City in the whole wide world, hey
City in the whole wide world, hey

I got my go go go go go go go go go go gadget flow
I got my go go go go go go go go go go gadget flow
I got my go go go go go go go go go go gadget flow
I got my go go go go go go go go go go gadget flow

Hey, hey don't hate on me
My tank on full, your tank on e
Look good on you, look great on me
Cause I'm a go and never gunna S-T-O-P
Like hey, hey don't hate on me
My tank on full, your tank on e
Look good on you, look great on me
Cause I'm a go and never gunna S-T-O-P

Like hey, hey I'm the boss
Rock genuine time, not bear the cost
Beyond clean, in phenom jeans
Little rap is like azemof
I let my momma in the rhyming that she raised me off
A 80s baby on fire like a safety off
Got my hood ridin high on them 28s
Off of everything that's gon be like a 84
And they in love with him and I'm in love with them
And we'll never ride dubs again
No we won't
Tryna get a butter rim
A little too short to dunk
So we dock

From the M-A-D-I to the S to the O-N
Potent, to get you open
Move like a nigga supposed to
Get your dough on the go with the flow
That I'm holdin

I got my go go go go go go go go go go gadget flow
I got my go go go go go go go go go go gadget flow
I got my go go go go go go go go go go gadget flow
I got my go go go go go go go go go go gadget flow
