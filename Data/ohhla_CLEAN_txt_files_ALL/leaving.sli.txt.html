Song:   Leaving On a Jet Plane
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

All my bags are packed, I'm ready to go
I'm standing here outside the door
I hate to wake you up to say goodbye
But the dawn is breakin', it's early morn'
The Taxi's waitin', he's blown his horn
Already I'm so lonesome I could die

There's so many times I've let you down
So many times I've fooled around
I tell you now they don't mean a thing
Ev'ry song I sing I sing for you
Ev'ry girl me lay I lay for you
When I come back I'll bring your wedding ring

So kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you'll wait for me
Hold me like you never let me go
'Cause I'm leaving on a jet plane

Don't know when I'll be back again
Oh babe, I hate to go</pre>
