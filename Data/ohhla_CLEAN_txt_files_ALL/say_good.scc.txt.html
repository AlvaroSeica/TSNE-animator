[ VERSE 1: Prodeje ]
Cold in the city, I stroll like a damn fool
Smokin your ass on the strip, you're not cool
You beat up my homie but didn't kill him, you wish you did
Cause this murder rap will leave you dead and rid
Of indecision, I got to Uzi to buck it off of a clocker
Called up Havoc, he said, "Let's roll on the muthafucka"
Put up the four, four niggas with hot heads
Gee got the AK and loaded the shit dead
It's fucked for the nigga but he didn't know
Yo, the Mouthpiece got up and aimed and he ducked low
Fool, you wanna dance with the devil?
So I'm sendin you home, you better get you a shovel
Havikk hit the corner, Luva Gee got the AK
We spotted the gang and then we started to spray
A nigga spotted the move and said, "Duck!"
The dumb fuck is dead
I shot him in his goddamn head

[ CHORUS ]
(Open fire like a lunatic from Vietnam)
(Fuck that, say goodbye to the bad guy)	--&gt; Scarface
(Another nigga dead)				--&gt; Ice Cube

[ VERSE 2: Havikk ]
12 on the nose, I hit a corner with a tense pose
Shootin niggas, gettin blood on my damn clothes
A nigga slippin on the dark streets
I put they ass to sleep and leave they blood on the concrete
Yo, I'm from the hood shootin punks from the rooftop
Snipin your ass, I'm givin a fuck about a damn cop
Leavin notes on your window pane
As you step out your door I'm blowin out your brain
Fool, my alias Havikk, a damn gee from the dark side
A lyrical psycho who laughs in homicide
Cause through the night I creep, swarm and terrorize
Knock on your door and put a bullet between your eyes
Drag your body in a alley
As your corpse deteriorates like a damn cavity
My piece rolls to unload the reign of terror
Dead as fuck, hard as hell, then your brain fails

[ CHORUS ]

[ Havoc ]
Yo, this Havoc The Mouthpiece from the S.C.C.
That was only phase two of a muthafuckin massacre
So sit the fuck down because phase three is a muthafucka

[ VERSE 3: Prodeje ]
It was like the wild west in South Central
I jumped out the car and shot a fool in the window
The nemesis wrecks this in the premises
I mean business and you could be the goddamn witness
A nigga will die hard and kill up a few punks
The busters will scatter and I stepped on a dead hunk
Of flesh, open fire on a goddamn house
And three hoes butt-naked try to break out south
I shot a bitch in her ass, Rhimeson got her neck
Havoc got her in the head, now she shook for a sec
Cause they ( ? ) and started to set-trip
Prodeje laughed, I said, "Give me a fresh clip"
I tell you muthafuckas who to fuck with
Niggas let out a pit, I had to blow him to shit
It was a mission, a vision of parallelism, we did em
And got ghost, but yo, who's next to play close?
