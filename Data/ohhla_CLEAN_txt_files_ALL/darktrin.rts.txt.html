[Black Thought]
Mountain high and valley low and river wide and tunnel deep
I have traveled chasing demons, screaming all I find I keep
If you don't pay like you weigh, alright okay that's fine with me
I'ma just splay my heat then say my piece and lay you down to sleep
Ain't nobody tell you clowns to speak, I'ma AK you down the street
Draw that pump that's built for the +Riots+ see how +Quiet+ y'all can keep
Ain't no whylin, it ain't no pro'lem, ain't no question, ain't no beef
Cut that check then thangs are sweet, I'ma go buy some diamond teeth
I'll be damned if my setback gon' help you get back on yo' feet
No surrender no retreat, nigga we out here tryna eat
#Hashtag diamond dog tag, money bag, nice swag
Pockets need an ice bag, toe tag, body bag
Niggaz lose their lives sad, rockets in their flight path
Breaking bad, making bad, choices out here thinkin fast
Smokin wet and drinkin bad, soaking wet and sinkin fast
Shoot them niggaz makin cash, stick them niggaz take their stash
The law of gravity meets, the law of averages
Ain't no sense in attempting to civilize savages
Even though I wish I could be spared my embarrassment
I'm a nigga, other niggaz pale in comparison
We out in Paris yet but still a nigga perishing
No idea how much time's left, fuck tryna cherish it
A life in times unchecked, now that's American
Inherit the wind, pressure in everything

[Greg Porn]
The world ain't ready, for someone like me
when life is sex, drugs, drama and I'm hooked on all three
I'd rather O.D. than be the next O.G
that's frontin for a hoe that already chose me
One man revolution that's supportin prostitution
I'm tryna pimp the game, where ballin don't mean hoopin (swish)
And ridin don't mean cruisin, it mean keep your bitch-ass movin
If you ain't built for bruisin, redrum ain't in your blueprint
In a jungle made of concrete, every animal Jumanji
On Eazy-E and PCP - ass, cash, or EBT
How you monetize pigeons on a power line
On a road to the riches, every dude's a dollar sign
I don't mind, I donât mind, long as all the smoke is mine
And the liquor store delivers faster than a Papa John's
And I heard that death is callin, money's on the other line
The last episode of Good Times, is my life

[Dice Raw]
It's a phrase they say in the streets when the young players meet - "Get rich or die tryin'!" (Get rich)
But the funny thing about that phrase to me is that these lil' niggaz be lyin! (be lyin)
Cause don't nobody wanna die (wanna die), but everybody tryna get rich though (get rich)
But the fucked-up thing about that these lil' niggaz don't how to get rich, so
I still run with those angels, man I still peep all those angles
Keep 'em with guns, speakin in tongues, talkin that Arabic and that Yiddish
Ridin them trains, stashin them chains, bangles - yeah I played all those games though (I played 'em)
My tag on the wall, you niggaz look up, you can still see my name yo
How did I, end up, where I'm, at? It's kinda hard to explain yo
I remember, all I, wanted, was a, gold chain and a Kangol
I remember, all I, wanted, was a, gold chain and some Jordans too
Crushed that bitch 'til I got that bitch, now all I want from her is an abortion
My mind filled with distortion, my eyelids say caution
Yeah I sold crack to get my soul back, they say it's gon' cost a fortune
And I wonder if Allah take debit (take debit), cause a nigga got real bad credit (bad credit)
If not I ain't got a whole lot, so a nigga like me just can forget it - HA~!</pre>
