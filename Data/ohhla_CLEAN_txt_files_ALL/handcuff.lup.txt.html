Sittin in the back of the police car position
Your mission is forgetting and denying they existence
Thinking of different ways to keep from submitting
and continuing not tomention...like that
Grand marquee police interceptor edition
with wall so you can barely fit in
Knees is touching the front seat shifting
Cause your handcuffs is cutting your wrist and
Your wishin that he would drive faster pleeeease
But he slows the hood as he drives past the free
It's cool but you trippin' the quicker you get there
The quicker you sit there and cuffed to a bench and
They playing good cop, bad cop one of the them
pretending so you rewindyourself
To your uneasy recline in the back of the police car
hand-cuffed to the seat belt...NAW
"You ain't gotta quicken the pace"
That just give me more time to sit and erase
Alibi and aliase switch and replace
Think about then figure out an escape thank God that I'm up in the states
Cuz if I was in Russia who knows how'd they do a hustla
Waite! I ain't a hustla I'm straight
I'm damn near a busta, no laws I break
Money I never seen guns, I didn't hold
drugs I never sold calls I didn't make
Nigga this is a waste of your time and mines
"Is that uncomfortable?"...."I fine"
A case? this ain't even a fine
You ain't find nothin' homie not even a dime
Not even a don that'll drop dime on me
I know you as Don so you put a dime on me
I know thats a crime you suppossed to fight crime for me
Protect and to serve
Prosecute, correct and return to the homies
And thats gonna send direct to the curb, so you can put em back on me

He's sittin in the front of the police car position
His mission is bending, pinning charges on niggas even if they didn't
He's sittin in court lying, testifying against defendants LIKE THAT
And he love to choke niggas
He don't trip wit the rich he just love the broke niggas
Probably did more dirt in the street than most niggas
Even the old people don't like em, cuz of the way he approach niggas
"Nigga you ain't no better than me"
Just a hustla wit a badge confiscate the dope money
Put it wit your retirement boat money
You ain't building no playgrounds in the poor for some cash
That ain't a pension thats a shoe box stash
Wit a glock to protect it we both undercover check it
Thinking that the good we do, gonna out weigh the sinning that we do to
collect it
Sayin its for the community, they don't value us
Only around because the property value up
And they gotta clean the street before they put the houses up
Knock the Section 8's down...put them 200,000's up
Feel he don't get paid enough
To kick in doors to raid and cuff
So he use what niggas get on the street to supplement the wages cut
So he gotta keep just enough niggas out there hustlin to keep his paper up
LIKE THAT!!!...Maybe he should be in the handcuffs
