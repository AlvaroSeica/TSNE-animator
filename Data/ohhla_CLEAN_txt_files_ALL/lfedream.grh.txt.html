[Chorus: x2]
Life. Dreams. Work
However, Work. Dreams. Life
It's all about 

[Luckyiam.PSC]
Now old Mr. Patterson
Had us in his front yard 
Explainin' all the reasons why his life so hard
I took a seat on his porch, right side of his hammock
He told tales of mishaps, somebody ever had it
That way it made his strong he said
I could feel him
Destiny shuffled up his cards and had to deal 'em to him
Straight up, no second round
Second time around
No time to half step
Man, you gotta put it down
What he said made sense
He told tales of war
Conflicts with men
Money, the whores
And the women he came across
Times he fell in love
The children who abandoned him
Promised that they would love 
Him
Forever
But they never visit
Benefits dwindle, holiday visits so spread apart
So sparse
Loneliness and ghosts of heart wrench
But no one, the darkest days start
Which enable him to remark
His days of the past
His old army buddies
The trenches
The blasts
Explosions of memories sent shrapnel to my psyche
Explainin' my youth
He said, "You started off just like me
Got a hard head like me
Prepare for mistakes
But focus on your future 
And you'll make it through the gate."
The gate
The gate
The gate

[Chorus]

[The Grouch]
Life life
Almost everything I know and have known I was shown
Learned how to innovate but never would have grown
To be 23, goin' on 24 
Goin' on many more occasions
I need to stay in the right mind state
To make my impressions felt
Like a lesson learned from being punished
Blessin' in disguise though really
Now wise, so silly to think
That momma didn't know what's right
So when I show I'm tight
She gets props 
And when I deal with a fight directly
Thank my pops
He would check me in the art of
Being a man
And when I thought I was smart 
I really didn't understand
I really couldn't see the plan 
Working
Kinda like Dan thought Mr. Miyagi was just jerkin'
Him around
While he painted while the sun went down
When truly it was knowledge he was lucky he found
I'm on
Solid ground
Put a dollar down to learn
If you got something to share
Go head voice your concern
Cause who am I to be the U.N.I. Verse (universal)
Alright, respect the dark to the light
And the young to the old
