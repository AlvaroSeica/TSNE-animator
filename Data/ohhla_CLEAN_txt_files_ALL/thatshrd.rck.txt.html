[Intro: Sample from Earl Sixteen "No Mash Up Dance"]
Di dread at di control, international, control all thru di world

[Styles P]

[Pete Rock Scratchin]
Styles P!!!

[Verse One: Styles P]
I ain't tell you that I'm local brother (Yeah!) 
I keep the Tek and Steele like the Cocoa Brovaz
My niggas still Smif-N-Wessun to me (MY G!!!)
Hard headed to God bodies, couldn't teach a lesson to me
Aqui's couldn't reach me, neither could the church boys
I was outside with a gun movin that work boy (I was outside!)
Whattup natty head, bull head, beard men
Some niggas sizzlin us we can't sear men
A fried to a frickaseed, and I'm no Wiccan
So I don't wear roseries or thicker beads
No crosses, no Bible or Qu'ran, just survival on my mind
With a gun up on my palm
All spiritual nigga, I'm all lyrical
Dyin to come back I'm the ghost of all miracles (GHOST!)
I told them I could stare at Medusa (I could!) 
They think that I'm high but I'm really tryin to stay in the future and shoot ya!!!
Nigga! Ghost!

[Interlude: Pete Rock Scratchin]
G-G-G-'Gon take that shit out of somebody...somebody
