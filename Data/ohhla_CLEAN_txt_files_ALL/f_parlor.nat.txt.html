I advise y'all to open your eyes
and ask JFK if flyin through the skies you can die
And all the ballers out there cookin them pies
do you even realize why we lookin so high?
It's a surprise, It's the end for us all
the hieroglyphics told mysteries on the pyramid walls
I feel the force drag me into the light
The same one who stole the life in the still of the night

(I see dead people all in my sight, even when I close my eyelids tight
with all my might.)
(I see dead people)

I often wonder, do dead men dream?
about the life they lived and all the fancy things?
about who was paid? and who was broke?
about who had the most money, ho's and dope?
about that one nigga who just couldn't cope
life came down crashin like a nigga on a ski slope
Can I rock this one for Redd Fox?
I saw Biggie Smalls, I saw Tupac
I saw the nigga with the gun bust 2 shots
some of you believe me and some of you do not

(I see dead people all in my sight, even when I close my eyelids tight
with all my might.)
(I see dead people)

Check the rigamortis, cause time moves slow as a tortoise
like a virgin, like Madonna till she had little Lordis
You can't afford us Time goes fast, life's the shortest
Officially for the good green weed and coke snorters
Support us, look how far the dead brought us
2000 AD rock the funeral parlors
Dead ballers and dirt crawlers, under the surface
You must know the difference, between an angel and the serpents

(I see dead people all in my sight, even when I close my eyelids tight
with all my might.)
