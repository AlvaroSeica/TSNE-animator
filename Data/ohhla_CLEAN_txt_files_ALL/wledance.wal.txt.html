1st verse:
 
Yea,
When I'm gone the whole city missed me 
Im on my UK shit
Get me
The eye of the Bengal shuffling my 8 gig
Y'all boomer, You need you an MD
Like eastsire sin
Dominating of the eastside shall commence
And I shall commence that I'm the truth yo
They try to block me like Moonyos
I know my car is worth like phone card
I get brain everyday, Im a know it all
More birds then know it all cool yar
Keep talking my know it knows none of y'all
Hit the green like running backs with no yards
No Hoe, I'm playing with the floor
Overly Ingracious
They call me say word
Niggas say word
Just so happens my nigga for
Yours is the for
We ahead of the curve
And they all looking like the girls on virgin
Cut beats, I'm a fucking wordsurgeon
Scalp and sponge
This work
Dance
 
Chorus:
Under the spotlights 
Neither black nor white
It doesn't matter 
Do the dance (do the dance)
 
As strong as you might 
Working day and night 
What ever happens
Do the dance (do the dance)
 
2nd Verse:
 
On my way back home 
Now I'm in the zone
My simcards a bomb
They blowing up my phone
Kicks Hong Kong
Bape in a garment
The face of hip-hop 
My DC audience
And you niggas will acknowledge this
Born again social life thanks climate
My climate is way higher then Lindsay Lohan nostrils on powder
Sorry mark I don't want offend your sisters good friend
But when my pen get in
It pretends it's a soul in a intatee
And it interferes and gets the best of me
So I'm one with that
Im stuck with that
Y'all little ass niggas can't fuck with that
Nigga, It's a sign for a truck to rap
Little light in the ass 
But I must rap 
And I must admit 
I bring creotine to the scene
Your developmental league don't see a team
I got a stich lil nigga
You can see my seam
Split Salvage my nigga in summer jeans
Kick you my denim bar
Kicks made you look Nas
Riding in the black joint listening to Gnarls Barkley's 
On DS y'all, DS flow like nothing y'all heard
Broke ass niggas all see before
Low cash niggas, broke ass niggas 
I don't fuck with y'all hoe ass niggas
I be rammy sippin ammo as sippin
Im a 35 double o ass niggas
Rattin out niggas, KY niggas, Trinidad Niggas
I got y'all niggas
DC Pimpin, Uptown Roamin
Moco 1 2 4 when I go out
PG all more where my niggas ball at 
Say what you want 
Logo with my homie
Do this shit for harlem
Smoking on a marley
Rolled in a marlin
Fresh above the water
Say I'm not hot 
Then your prolly on water
They prolly on water, they prolly on water
Prolly on water, They all on water
Acquire more bras then Zachary morris
yall lost crete to me
You released the beef  and I play your little niggas like least to shit
Y'all ass niggas don't worry me to the least to bit
And a finger in the middle that I leave em with
I cant heal little niggers and he be's a bitch
Whats the least, I don't know English
Fuck it, I'm done 
Let me breathe hard like it was hard 
Huh Huh
Huh Huh
Huh Huh
Huh Huh
Gone
 
Chorus:
 
Under the spotlights 
Neither black nor white 
It doesn't matter 
Do the dance (do the dance)
 
As strong as you might 
Working day and night 
Whatever happens 
Do the dance (do the dance)</pre>
