[Skit #1: Dialogue from the 1988 'Above the Law' movie]
[Bruce Evers as Frank Yates] You heard about what's going on in there?
[Peter Murnik as a Trooper:] Heard a lot a bullshit talked, I know that much
[Bruce Evers as Frank Yates] This isn't bullshit my friend
[Female Voice] Do you know something?
[Peter Murnik as a Trooper:] Don't listen               
[Female Voice] What'd you know?

[Bruce Evers as Frank Yates] 
Maybe I do and maybe I don't
What I say is that they ain't got no business negotiating
We ought to be going back in there with a bullet for everybody in the yard

[Peter Murnik as a State Trooper] HEH! Is that right?

[Bruce Evers as Frank Yates] 
We do it now, we do it later
Later it can be new use, am I right Hal?

[Harry Dean Stanton as Hal]
Now, wait, wait minute Frank
We gotta a lot of angry guys in there
Black Muslims, Panthers, The Young Lords besides you 
The average antisocial..

[Bruce Evers as Frank Yates] 
So we gotta go in, right? Clean their clocks!

[Verse One: KM.G]
I hit a little juice, and pulls up in the Deuce
He gives me the scoop about the fake ass troops
And how niggaz out there wanna play
I take another hit of the way, and then I blast away
[Cold 187Um] How far player? - Far enough to go off the edge
I push another nigga off the ledge
So I stumble as I slide to the Chevy
Yeah, my eyes kind of teary, and gun kind of heavy
I'm a Walking Dead Man is what they call me when I'm coming
Got the big S on my chest, so I'm kind of gunning
High powered on my way too the West Side
To check upon on some chickens, it's a hell of a drive, so drive on
As I hit my dodo stick to the break of dawn
Crime fighting's what I do, and niggaz in my crew
Don't take lightly to you busters, and so we say fuck you
Then buck you, tuck you in for the night
As you think about the paper at the funeral sight
So when I'm hanging with the clique, and we're in demand
I feel good that the City of Angels call me Black Superman

[Chorus: DJ Total K-Oss Computer Voice] X2
Yeah!! Yeah!! Now you will see.. Black Superman
Yeah!! Yeah!! You're now Black Superman
Yeah!! Yeah!! call me, call me

[Skit #2: Phone rings and Cold 187Um's answering machine picks up]
Yo it's Hutch, I ain't in right now! 
But uhh.. leave a message please!
Get all about flossing, tossing, dipping and tripping
You know what I'm saying?

[DJ Total K-Oss]
Aiy Hutch man uhh.. they're just fleeced your mama's house
Man Uhh.. I don't know what they got
Uhh.. that sound broke, Uhh.. they're looking for us man
Call me, with peace out, man (*Hangs up phone*)

[Verse Two: Cold 187Um]
Now, it was once said by an old O.G.
Always trying to come up, yeah! and that's a G
HUH! cause where I from is like a curse
Cause see, once in the lifetime everybody did some dirt
I guess it got to me the same
So at the age of fifteen, I entered the dope game
I had my game locked up tight
In the day I went to school, but I clerked all night
And when I went to class I always feel to sleep
But I was out like a motherfucker, if somebody beeped
My teacher said: boy can't it wait?
I said: No! I got to put some more icing on my cake
I think I saved about fifty G's
I bought a truck, a house and a Coupé on D's
Moms is tripping but she really don't know
All I'm thinking, is she ain't on the county no more
Before my mama fucked with the county again
I'd rather take the risk of doing five to ten
I'm not taking a Check, I'm straight making the Checks
So now we deserve, to get what we wanna get
I got my mama up out of there
Because y'all motherfuckers just don't care
HUH! you really wanna know why I sold scum?
Because my mama told me, comes number one
Now you sucker motherfuckers don't understand
But to my mama, I'm her real Black Superman

[Chorus:] X2</pre>
