[Intro: Ice-T]
1994 BC Rise

[Chorus:Ice-T ]
Masters of Revenge, masters of Payback
Inciters of Chaos, messengers of Rage

[Ice-T]
All we wanna do to you, is what you did to us
All we wanna take from you, is what you stole from us
Masters of Revenge, masters of Payback
Inciters of Chaos, messengers of Rage

[Chorus:]
Body Count, Body Count
Body Count, Body Count

[Ice-T]
You can't kill us, we're already dead
You can't kill the truth, you're already dead
Masters of Revenge, masters of Payback
Inciters of Chaos, messengers of Rage

[Chorus: Ice-T]
Body Count, Body Count
Body Count, Body Count

[Ice-T]
You took my past, I want your future
You took my parents, we want your children
Masters of Revenge, masters of Payback
Inciters of Chaos, messengers of Rage

[Chorus: Ice-T]
Body Count, Body Count
Body Count, Body Count

[Ice-T]
There can never be justice, on stolen land
There's nowhere to run, you can't escape fate
Masters of Revenge, masters of Payback
Inciters of Chaos, messengers of Rage

[Chorus: Ice-T]
Body Count, Body Count
Body Count, Body Count

[Outro: Ice-T]
