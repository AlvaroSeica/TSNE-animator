[Mystikal]
Well bitch I'm country as cowboy boots
I debut beatin' boy band groups
Nigga let me know what the fuck yall wanna do
Either keep up or you can't
Mildew or barbeque! Crack or do yo thang!
Dang I ain't come here for no dumb shit
You tell me which one of them is the hardest nigga: lyrics or the drum kick?
And when its finished over and done with
Imma smoke a blunt and knock the pussy off some bitch
I ain't no speedy and you said I beat it too much
I ain't gon eat it you aint gon' drown me and I pound it enough
They see me leavin' with the big butt woman
With me walkin' funny pussy up in her stomach
Sittin' in the front cause the tv's runnin'
Peanut butter leather seat with "Big Truck" on it
I musta kidnapped a nigga main honey cause I heard em holl'n
"Hold on baby I'm coming!"

[Chorus: Butch Cassidy]
We hushed those (ssshh) who never thought we would get this far
But bitch I told you - Tarantula - so do what you 'sposed to - Tarantula
Give me brains stop lookin' strange bitch shit changed
It's just like I told you - Tarantula - came up like I'm 'sposed to

[Mystikal]
And I'm known as the mutha fuckin' black prince of the south
So wop-ba-ba-loo-bop bitch watch out
I make ya mama shake a tail feather
Dont tell ya daddy that I'm here cause you know it make him feel threatened
Go get ya sexy dress to turn me on
While he down there quotin Betty Wright, "I know you not gon' sing that song!"
I hit the chart and never move off or homie cool off
Before your nose look like Rudolf
I give it to em and this bitch can't handle it
Ol' ugly jealous mutha fucka this shit's jammin
Ridiculous amounts of raw uncut talent
On top of bass string kicks and piano
They callin me big bucks no whammies
This year I'm screaming Jive Records Big Truck got dammit
Heads up tighten up nigga move
Rank: CEO - slash - rapper - slash - fool

[Chorus]

[Mystikal]
(Butch: Watch you gon' do?)
I'm fixin' to blow up like the jaws of Dizzy Gillespie
Heavens to Betsy
Julio Iglesias couldn't out-rock me
Speedy Gonzales couldn't come catch me
The Grammy-nominated, especially
The Soul Train Award Winner, call me "Black Elvis Presley"
You probably cant keep up with what you see me on
Either 106 &amp; Park, Queen Latifah, Chris Rock or Jenny Jones
Knock down buildings chop down trees
I kick so fuckin hard they say, "You Japanese!"
I'm up the millions 'cause of what I invent
Look at ya over there with ya seatbelt light on approachin your initial descent
A.K.A.  "The Tarantula"
Hot rhymes coming from a canister
I'm keepin my fans with somethin to brag on
These people in here ain't leavin' until I finish my fuckin' last song
Bitch walk like a barbarian
Tall dark and cut and keep them fuckin' hoes starin'

[Chorus 2x w/Mystikal saying "Tarantula"]

[Butch Cassidy]
South and the West come together
However, we plan on doing this shit quite clever
My nigga Mystikal, it's ya boy Butch Cass'
And we put a foot off in they ass
