[Verse 1 - Pharrell]
Hello? Hey mom, it's me mom
Can't tell you where I sleep mom
Cause that's where we be mom
Sometimes I steal and cheat mom
Yes, I get enough to eat mom
Mom, can you listen to me?
No! I don't mess with guns
Yes in my travels I have seen one
No, being a runaway is no fun
But house rules sure were not fun
Something told me to

[Chorus - Joel Madden &amp; Benji Madden]
(Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!)
(Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!)
And I don't care now
(Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!)
(Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!)
Cause we don't get out
(Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!)
(Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!)
I packed my things now
(Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!)
(Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!)
Fuck this shit right now, I'm checking out
(Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!)
(Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!)

[Verse 2 - Joel Madden]
Hey dad, I'm ok dad, that's what you say dad
I never could obey dad
You would have bad days dad
And you would make me pay dad make me feel way sad
Punk rock, tatoos, leather jacket
Good grades don't come with that package
Yes y'all I would love to match it
But names just make it harder to hack it by

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - Pharrell] + (Joel Madden)
Don't let your teachers teach you about wealth to death
Maybe there's something else (I'm checking out)
Don't let Massah teach you that we are by ourselves
Cause trust me there's something else (I'm checking out)
Oh la la la, la la, la la - la la la, la la, la la
Shh.. maybe there's something else (I'm checking out)
See we're not part of the Magna Charta
There's no shuttle for us to charter
No.. they're keeping it for themselves (I'm checking out)
My ex-girlfriend I'm trying
And her new boyfriend I'd fight him
And what about my cousins?
Tell em that I love 'em
I'm not perfect nor facetious
But at home I've felt fearless
Your son completely hateless
Turn to BBC you should see this
A thousand heads

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I woke up thinking something (I'm checking out) (jump!)
Wish I had it my way (jump!)
Though I'm a rebel some can say (I'm checking out) (jump!)
I'm told it's neither (jump! jump! jump!)
(I'm checking out) ..
(I'm checking out)
