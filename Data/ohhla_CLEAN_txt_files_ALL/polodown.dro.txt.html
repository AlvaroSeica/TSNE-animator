Polo down [repeats]
Ralph Lauren, Luis Gucci [repeats]

I am from...
I am feeling the buzz
Ain't no shit about the bubble
I am feeling the...
Be pussy nigger male
I am feeling the...
Drop the lyrics on Catherina
I am feeling the...
Ain't got the phone number
I am feeling the call
... be serious
They are feeling the...
Half million for my condom

I am feeling the...
Ask me what I have
But I am feeling the...
Should I go live in Brazil
I haven't decided
I am feeling money make it real...
I stay fresh mother fucker
Who's asking about me

Ralph Lauren, Luis Gucci [repeats]
Polo down [repeats]

I'll be fresh
I'll be good</pre>
