[Toby]
her eyes say she needs me now 
but her words try to keep me out 
my feet are grounded, using up my gravity 
abusing the new snooze button on my sanity 
this ain't a friendship, it's 
just silly to deny that the tension exists 
bottled up, sensing the risk 
walking tough, both hands clenched in a fist 
like were meant to be together 
but fear just intervened tempting me to let a 
moment pass we'll never see again 
no going back, cause everything will end 
thats life, nothing is perfect but still 
gotta work through the nerves cause it's worth it to feel 
you get hurt, you deal, its part of the path 
can only run so far before you start coming back 

[Chorus]
it's about to go down 
I can hear the sound 
inside my head 
of your heartbeat calling me 
from it's hiding place 
it's about to go down 
I can hear hear the sound 
inside my head 
of your heartbeat calling me 
heartbeat calling me 

[Toby]
bedroom eyes, silent love songs 
unify when the night becomes dawn 
fire is burning in our veins 
let all the inhibitions turn in their graves 
only certain is today 
let our bodies speak words we're still learning how to say 
open the curtains to the stage 
pull the pieces of the puzzle, put em perfectly in place 
finding minutes in the seconds 
dance to the rhythm only hidden in the presence 
of innocence and bitterness swimming in the essence 
pause, cut the ribbon and just let it fall 
gotta build it from the ground up 
now I found a cloud that I ain't coming down from 
the sound of music written to the hope 
eyes closed, both sides, hold tight, let go 

[Chorus]
it's about to go down 
I can hear the sound 
inside my head 
of your heartbeat calling me 
from it's hiding place 
it's about to go down 
I can hear hear the sound 
inside my head 
of your heartbeat calling me 
heartbeat calling me 

[Toby]
It used to be much better 
so pure like a rough edit of a love letter 
unfettered hearts like "come get it" 
one step in and one out like I was trusted to sublet it 
but that rush had flushed every doubt out 
without receiving enough credit 
so it's tough to be upset at us ending 
up just being a lust with a love fetish 
denial keeps the eyes bright 
when the twilight creeps beneath the skyline 
to leave a kind of sign that time is finite 
and ya find that it might just wind right down 
on illusions created 
of her, I made cause the truth was too overrated 
her? I didn't know. me? she didn't have 
now we live with both, trying to give it back 
give it back

[Outro 3x] 
and it's never gonna be the same 
forever begins today 
the seconds gonna tick away 
baby don't let go</pre>
