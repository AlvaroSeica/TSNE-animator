[Verse 1: T.I.]
Sit back, toss dice in a knick trap
Serve thick crack in white T's and fitted caps
These sick reps, this my life you just spit raps
I been a hustler all my life gimme six stacks
Cop my self a quarter kite I can flip that
Cook it till its solid white tell ?em hit that
Big fat Os of that solid hard git that
Those slangin blow on a boulevard knick sacks
Just as big around as a Tylenol, hit that
Nigga with the Yay tell him now bring a brick back
Now I'ma move it by day nigga 6 max
And ain't no runnin' off with yay shootin' big straps
40 cals, Sk's with no kick back
Get you get your shit sacks right where your dicks at
and I don't think your clicks just supposed to forget that
I gotta a gauge for that day you want some git back
While we sprayin all you niggas sayin git back
Duck down nigga, naw what now nigga
you was talking plenty shit but you aint tough now nigga
You don't know the click, I got enough wild niggas that'll 
Hit you then ride you to another town nigga
Dig a hole, throw you in it for a half a brick a blow
Man, Rappin' and Movies is all these niggas know
Swear to God He niggas true fags
Certified Douche Bags..

[Verse 2: Juelz Santana]
Yea
You don't know what that new glock do
You don't know how to count chump, 2 times 2
You don't know what the grimin's like or that new rock do
You don't know what it is to see that shoe box full
Chump, you don't know what that oo op do
Have your block like oo aa oo
Who shot who
Yea, I leave the gun there so the police think you shot you
Then hop in a coupe and do my due
I pimp most of these bitches, really open these bitches
Ask about me, you thought Pretty Tony was vicious
Man I'm that times 2
So please homey, cuff your bitch and let that guy through
Let that guy move
Let that guy go
Man that guy crazy
Let that guy know
Cat got rabbies
Yea mac got Amy
Shots that ready to pop and hatch like babies
I lock the block down
Like a jailhouse lockdown
Cops found razors in the mattress
I let the 8 boop off at your face dude
Have you comin out the speakers like the base do
I'm a mothafucken beast and animal
2003, the street's new hannible
Man I show you what the piece and hammer do
Raise my arm with the piece and hammer you
Let the 8 spread, off at your face head
Watch your face shead sorta like snake's shead
Im gorrilla born, lion hearted, ape bread
2 minded, eagle eyed, beatle side, snake head
And I play dead, just to fool you, just to move you
All that just to shoot you
Fall Back, this kid is cuocoo

[Verse 3: Cam'Ron]
Cha ching, I'm in
Bling my rims I sing they spin
But my 2 nine M's, they the ying yang twins
Cuz they Skeet, Skeet, Skeet, Skeet, from the window to the wall
From the ceiling to the floor
With a feeling when you ball
Make your mom cling
Im into don things
Don Don, Donna Karren, Don Cornelius, Don King
But follow Jon Gotti, Joe Pesci, armed robbery
Hard body, body hard doggy fuck up your bodyguard
Dolly call us the shotty ma
Yall'll call up the squally squaw
Prolly hard, get it all the squally in the party pa
Right in the hamerstein
Gasoline, tear gas, pepper seed, tear fast
Knight sticks tear ass
Cuff ?em and chief goes
Damn gun that he reach for
Hammer hit with the cheap blow
Man its nothing I eat those
Then I piss off my fowl, I lay for it
Car, Crib, credit, A 1 steak sauce
Ima straight boss, great loft, great Porsche, golf course, race horse, Aqueduct, Ray Soft
And I make one call to get the pussy poppin
Call your girl, pop that pussy wanna pussy pop
And a hoochie split it, dookie hit it, booby hit it
Her booby wanna back the coochie play some luchie wit it
Booby at this thing, damn he all moody with it
She ain't all that in that car I say Suzuki civic
I make a movie with it just to get my point across
Dog hand cuffin' god damn join the force
Mommy, come join the boss
Stick your tongue out and
toing a toing a toing on my dick till your voice get hoarse
Once again I gotta tell you that the boy's a boss
I employ the force
Half a mil on lawyer Cost
