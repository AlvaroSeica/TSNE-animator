Heads up, nigga
Wale
Play it back
Emile

Off jump, boo, cudi get ya funk
Hit ya in your head then it work it to your rump
Hate a nigga scared, hey leave him off stump
They gotta like a nigga
Call me Obama
Not a hype beast while you beast for the hype
Yea I'm the underdog, story of my life
Matter fact I dreamed that I lived twice
Once as a slave who imagined bein' free
And made it out happy for his family and his seed
And now me, you can call me mister friendly
One life to live, but no actin' on my nigga Friendy
Can't stand evil bitches when they befriend me
All they do is envy and plot up on my loins
I give you options, baby flip a coin
You get McDonalds, forget the sirloin
Hatin' my mackin', they askin'

Is there any love
In this world?
Is there any love
In this world?
Is there any love
In this world of voice?
Is there any love
In this world? </pre>
