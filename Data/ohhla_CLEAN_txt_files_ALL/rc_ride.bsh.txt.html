Chorus: Ocie Groceries
If you wanna ride, then you better get live
Does everybody wanna ride a roller coaster ride
A roller coaster ride, yeah, roller coaster ride
Does everybody wanna ride a roller coaster ride

Repeat Chorus Twice

[Verse 1: Baby Bash]
Oh my goodness gracious, that thing you got's amazing
That kitty cat is lookin' phat, and I'm the dog that's chasin'
I be mero caliente, man, that body's blazin'
Puerto Rican mamacita, black skin, light or Asian
Caucasian
I'm so lost, I need your navigation
Beam me up, I'm comin' up, expect me on your station
Turn me up, yeah, crank it up, my song is what they playin'
And if I get you home tonight, then baby, ain't no playin'
I'm sayin'
Go 'head, mama, let 'em get in line
Cause everybody wanna ride a roller coaster ride
But they ain't packin' what I'm packin', ain't too far behind
So I'm a go 'head baby girl, and let 'em stand in line

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 2: King Solo]
Mama, take a ride with a G, roller coaster Range Rover
Purple paint, white seats, just like I played for Minnesota
Drop top, in New York, mama say she want me back
My life is like a movie tour where everything is strapped, we get in
Boys wanna, girls too, I just keep it player with 'em
Mama lookin' real good, and I just like, playin' with 'em
Sexy, classy, real and nasty, and she know I'm 'bout mine
Just know I'm on a roller coaster when I'm on my down time

Repeat Chorus Twice

Break: Baby Bash
Step, step, step right up
Get your ticket, let it buck
Step, step, step right up
Get your ticket, let it buck
Form a line, let 'em through, baby show me what that do
Form a line, let 'em through, baby show me what that do

[Baby Bash {King Solo *slowed down*}]
All the girls that wanna WHAT!!! {Get your hands up}
All the girls that wanna WHAT!!! {Get-get-get your hands up}
All the girls that wanna WHAT!!! {Get-get your hands up}
{Get-get-get your hands up, g-g-g-get your hands up}
