[Boots Riley]
Listen to the, shotgun sonata from personas non grata
With a plot to rock harder than the secta intafada
I do, drink firewater but I'm more like Hiawatha
and will slaughter, slaughter, slaughter, your armada
Inform your scholars that our alma mater's squalor
So my squad'll pull your collar at your black-and-white gala
We're canon fodder for dollars both under Bush and Obama
I'm not a baller I'm a brawler callin y'all to come harder

[Chorus]
And I'm a Ghetto Blaster
Cause I'm a Ghetto Blaster
See I'm a Ghetto Blaster
I'm a ghetto, I'm a ghetto, I'm a ghetto, I'm a Ghetto Blaster!!!

[Boots Riley]
I'm from the land o' the free labor that planted the plan of the
black-and-branded to scram it over to Canada
A fan of radical bandits and bandanas
who slammed in the banana clip and rat-a-tat-tat-tatted-a
They spat the grammar to scam y'all to clamor up
The damn ladder to grab for Excalibur
Not a rap battler, but the next calibre
Catch the program and not just my pentameter

[Chorus]

[Interlude]
PULL THE TRIGGER~!
C'mon and help me out!
Said help me out!
Need y'all to help me out!
C'mon and help me out!
Help me out!
C'mon and help me out!
Need y'all to help me out!
Help me out!

[Boots Riley]
Cause I'm a Ghetto Blaster
Yeah I'm a Ghetto Blaster
I'm a Ghetto Blaster
I'm a ghetto, I'm a ghetto, I'm a ghetto, I'm a Ghetto Blaster!!!
I'm a Ghetto Blaster {*3X*}
I'm a ghetto, I'm a ghetto, I'm a Ghetto Blaster motherfucker!</pre>
