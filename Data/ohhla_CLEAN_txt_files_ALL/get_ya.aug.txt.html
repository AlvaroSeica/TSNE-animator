Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1: August Alsina]
They don't ever see you like I do
First thing when you wake up, before you put on your make up
And they don't really know you like I do
Cause me and you ain't the same, you ain't gotta run no game
Girl cause what you do and what I do ain't different
We both on a mission, I love your ambition
And I know how it is too hit the block and get the gwop
And you know what it is to hit the stage and make it pop
Like damm I hope somebody spent some money today
And I pray nobody try to come and take it away
Cause I'm just out here doing what I gotta do
Cause all these fucking bills are due
And I see all this money too make, so girl you know....

[Chorus: August Alsina]
I ain't judging you, go and get your money
Go and get your money, go and get your money
Baby, I salute go and get your money
Go and get your money, go and get your money
Take that money girl its yours
Spend that money girl its yours
You work hard for it, it's yours
Work that body baby its yours
I ain't judging you, go and get your money
Go and get your money, go and get your money

[Verse 2: August Alsina]
Single mother in college, working hard for them dollars
Girl we got something in common, making money with ballers
See you pussy popping that onyx, keep it clapping at magic
Got them niggas tricking that chalice
Come on making this happen
Girl I love seeing your back bend, they cashing out
And you cash in, they going broke and you working
Back broke when you twerking
I know how hard this shit can be, when income is uncertain
Hustling just too make a way, and I know you hoping
Somebody spent some money today
And I pray nobody try to come and take it away
Cause I'm just out here doing what I gotta do
Cause all these fucking bills are due
And I see all this money too make, so girl you know....

[Chorus: August Alsina]
I ain't judging you, go and get your money
Go and get your money, go and get your money
Baby, I salute go and get your money
Go and get your money, go and get your money
Take that money girl its yours
Spend that money girl its yours
You work hard for it, it's yours
Work that body baby its yours
I ain't judging you, go and get your money
Go and get your money, go and get your money

[Verse 3: Fabolous]
We grind together, we shine together
Show the single folks how to double
Two wrongs don't make it right
But two strong's make a power couple
And our trouble is small talkers
Talking down in the big spenders
But the winners focus on the win
And sore losers focus on the winners
Stacked up shawty, stacked up shawty
And if I ever need it, she the back up for me
Blacked up foree, his and hers Mercedes
No hoes to the house, just the first lady
So gon' get your money, don't let nobody stop that
Even if you gotta pop that (that body baby it's yours)
We do it big, an no together we about to do it bigger
My little mama hustle harder than a lot of these niggas

[Chorus: August Alsina]
I ain't judging you, go and get your money
Go and get your money, go and get your money
Baby, I salute go and get your money
Go and get your money, go and get your money
Take that money girl its yours
Spend that money girl its yours
You work hard for it, it's yours
Work that body baby its yours
I ain't judging you, go and get your money
Go and get your money, go and get your money</pre>
