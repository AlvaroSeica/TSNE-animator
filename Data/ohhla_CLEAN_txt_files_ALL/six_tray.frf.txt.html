(where my keys at?)
six tray... 
six tray...
no joke

Six tray, well hey, what do you say today?
some ol' silly ass fools I'll spray
now I wanna cruise some schools
like what you can, be cool
fast up Texas ?? fool
blue eyed devil killer
black man, a nine millimeter
in a presidents residence false evidence is evident
black six tray, who
out of shape, out of date girls
nigga's way cool

Six tray, well hey, what do you say today?
some ol' silly ass fools I'll spray
hittin' switches on Crenshaw
let me tell you what I saw
had a fight, hit a nigga, socked him in the jaw
now my head is swolled, damn this waters cold
maybe I shouldn't have attacked
nah, fuck that
six tray

We can cruisin' in my six tray (x2)

g, it all started at birth
I wanted to see how much my hood was worth
was born to be a child of voodoo
do as I do, follow and move you 
to the rhythm blues with a blue-r curse
sunken in rib cage, a point blank range
blow from a twelve gage, better get him a nurse
split second too late, brown hearse
right door second, left door first
I noticed my flaw in a plan
everything was rehearsed
two knocks on the door, but they did everything twice
received the device, two pairs of latex gloves
a scalpel, a rich knife
looked at each other and said let's get it on
strapped the body down, checked the temperature
to see if it was warm
stick man sculpture on front side
skin splits in two, reveal insides
now it was a homicide
as it drove away, I heard bullets ricochet
and a hell of a skid marks left from the six tray

See 'em off, give me a call
and we can roam, we can roll in my six tray
????, give me a call
and we can roam, we can roll in my six tray

We can cruisin' in my six tray
We can cruisin' in my six tray
Anywhere, anytime, any day
We can cruisin' in my six tray

yo, so if you ever, if you ever
see a tray rolled up with the lights out, 
smoke coming out of the window
you better lay the fuck down and run
this is a six tray

We can cruisin' in my six tray (x4)

<scrachted in="">:
point blank- point blank range
better lay the fuck down and run
blow from a twelve gage, a point blank range
there was a sign that said, six tray
blow from a twelve gage, a point blank range
better lay the fuck down and run, this is a six tray
blow from a twelve gage, a point blank range
there was a sign that said, this is a six tray

aw shit, I left the radio on</scrachted></pre>
