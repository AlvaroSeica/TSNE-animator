[Cee-Lo Green]
Yeah, let me hold you
Don't cry baby

If this makes you cry-yyyy
Girl I didn't mean it
Next time I should lie-ieee
The truth is inconvenient
I bet if you try-yyyy
You could live without me
I really don't know why-hyyy
You bother to cry about me

[Chorus]
Cry, cry baby
I guess that I'm the bad guy now
Cry, cry baby
And just like all the other ones
Cry, cry baby, ohhh

[Cee-Lo Green]
I hate to see you cry-yyyy
Sad to say I've seen it
We should say goodbye-yyyy
And this time really mean it
When some time goes byyyy
I'm sure that you'll feel better
But if she needs to cry-yyyy
Then maybe I should let her

[Chorus]

[Cee-Lo Green]
Now, help me find a way, yeah
What more, can I, sayyyyy?
To youuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu

[Chorus Final]
Cry, cry baby
I guess that I'm the bad guy now
Cry, cry baby
And just like all the other ones
Cry, cry baby
Build a wall around your heart
Cry, cry baby
Bay-bayyyyyyy

[Outro]
Ohhh, ohhh, OHHHHHH (just like all the other ones)
Oh-ohh, ohh, OHHHHHH (just like all the other ones)
Cryyy baby, cryyy baby - ow, ow, ow
Whenever she cry baby, cryyy babyyyy
Ah-ohhhh!
Don't cry baby...</pre>
