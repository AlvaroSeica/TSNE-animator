Swerve on 'em, niggas gotta nerve on 'em

But a nigga back home and now niggas roll wit him

[Chorus]

[Meek Mill]
Damn Tommy you ain't got no job (no job)

Compound niggas live now (live now)
if its the finals I'm balling like I'm LeBron now (Bron now)
I call up Odyssey tell them bitches to calm down (calm down)
I treat the jet like a taxi way the way I'm flyin' around (flyin' around) 
And I don't fuck with no niggas (I don't fuck with no niggas)
if they don't fuck with my niggas (they don't fuck with my niggas)
And I ain't fucking no bitches (no bitches)
