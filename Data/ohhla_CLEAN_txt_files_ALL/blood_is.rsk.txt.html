like sand through an hour glass
I sift through the past
in retrospect
and recollect
the circumstances
creating ras kass miosis
X Y genes, create the male human being
like jeru damaja, I come clean
2 point 5 million years ago
my dna through
all my ancestors make me who I am today
and to my predecessors I paved the way
no time to eat swine
standing on the county line
hey, despite we endorsing this family fuedin
domestic disputes
your peeps mad as alfred e newman
and it took me some more time to see
when ain't nobody got your back you always got your family
so to me yo
you served that crack head bastard over your kin, you violatin
just cos a nigga makes kids, doesnt make him a man or father
who loves ya baby

blood is thicker than water
blood is thicker than water
blood is thicker than water
Son, blood is thicker than water
from my grandmomma to my lil daughter
son, blood is thicker than water
blood is thicker than water
blood is thicker than water
Son, blood is thicker than water
from my grandmomma to my lil daughter
and I, I never put a hoe before the homies, nigga

seems like a short while ago
me and byrd swore to god, we'd never stop playing with g I joe
now we play with h, o, e' s's
women with big breasts's's
and niggaz compete to bag the freshest bitch
But brothers stay true thru thick and thin..
clocked a major, knew all it really takes is a few good men
but couldnt stand the rain
after the pain of betrayal goes away
you learn a nigga ain't ur homey just because he knows your slave name
Lemont Le-Dale, Curtis Bryan and Jason Terrents
revealed like a mason, but got
326 and 2 3rd more degrees
all you brothers got love like you was part of my family tree
im not anti-white but I'm pro black as hell
gotta save myself first
my family and my race before I save some god damn whales
let it surge through my veins like lava

blood is thicker than water
blood is thicker than water
blood is thicker than water
Son, blood is thicker than water
from my grandmomma to my lil daughter
son, blood is thicker than water
blood is thicker than water
blood is thicker than water
Son, blood is thicker than water
from my grandmomma to my lil daughter
and I, I never put a hoe before the homies, nigga</pre>
