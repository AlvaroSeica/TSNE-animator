Typed by: Knowledge God

[Long Axe]
People looking at me like I'm spinning my wheels
Acting like a nigga can't do it for real
Coming from a place where the heart was cold
Going to a place where you marched the flows
Damn it I'm a dreamer but I'm wide awake
Ain't feeling everybody, who am I to fake
A person like you who need music like air
Sounds to breathe to put your body over there
But with a gene in tune with a dreams
And soon it would seem that life redeemed would redeem
But here you go handing your music right over
You lose it, I'll struggle with the Hell you fight over
Now we overseas they love it more than us
Got B-Boys and breakers in the back of the bus

[Chorus x2: Long Axe]
Everything that I know, I can't stop
Everything that I know, I can't stop
Everything that I know, I can't stop
Everything that I know, I can't stop

[Long Axe]
I'm on the board and I'm ready to jump
Thirty year stories as my body kaputs
Hit the underground and I'm feeling at home
But then I realise that I'm all alone
Everybody fighting for a spot on the shelf
Stepping over people for a piece of the wealth

[Chorus]

[Long Axe]
Multiplied beef got the streets on edge
Bullets so freaky all they wanting is head
Bodies disappear, new thug reappears
"That shit is gangster", but what about the kids?
The money breaking back, taking house, taking world
Shaking, bringing home the bacon, still aching
Harlem shaking, pill taking too long to work
Kidnapped rap and had a ransom on the Earth
Pass that blunt or maybe drink that clear
Bring down the fence that's supposed to guard your ear
Fresh out of prison with a stale idea
I'ma make it toÂ… ratatattat now he out of here

[Chorus]</pre>
