"What the worrrrld needs now, is looove sweet looove
 It's the only thing, that there's just, too little of" {*echoes to fade*}

[Rasco]
Yeah, uhh, show 'em no love

[Intro]
When these brothers try to get out of line
When these brothers try to take your shine, show 'em no love
When these brothers try to test your crew
When these niggaz try to shit on you, show 'em no love
We show 'em no love, we show 'em no love
When they try to get down, show 'em no love

[Rasco]
Aiyyo it's Dick Swan' back in the flesh, back to win
Now where a track stand, it lead in the PAC-10 (ha)
You can tell by the look in my eye
Dudes better not give it a try, here's why
I (what) bump the hardest, dump your garbage
If your tracks ain't tight I make 'em bump regardless
It's the marksman, hittin your targets
Give 'em one shot clean in places that's unseen (blaow)
What's wrong with the world today?
I just want my little girl to play, let her find her way
That's why I'm on the grind today
Never havin no time to play, a brother got rhymes to say
(Yeah) I got bills to pay
I know you cats wanna know why I feel this way
Cause the man got us locked down, we gotta put it to a stop now
Hey let's burn this whole place down

[Chorus]
When these brothers try to get out of line
When these brothers try to take your shine, show 'em no love
When these brothers try to test your crew
When these niggaz try to shit on you, show 'em no love
When these brothers really get off track
Try to talk shit behind your back, show 'em no love
We show 'em no love, we show 'em no love
When they try to get down, show 'em no love

[Rasco]
Yo, I rock heavy handed
Go to your face at a pace with the intent to do heavy damage
They just couldn't stand it, man they had to test
But you niggaz never had to press
Nobody knows who your clique is, but I tell you what the trick is
(What?) Ride the next nigga dick kid
See if these cats can sell your name
With enough pub maybe they can swell your brain
To hell with fame (yeah) that was never the need
At my own pace settin the speed, checkin the feed
Give me one second to breathe, man I have your whole mouth taped up
Paralyzed from the waist up
But I gotta stay laced up, with the fresh gear
Guess you gotta get it next year
Get it clear man, this is never a joke
I know cats still sellin the smoke, aiyyo

[Chorus]

[Rasco]
I give 'em nothin they can cling to
Like fastballs on the swing-through; aiyyo I didn't really mean to
Most have known I'm postin strong
'Til cats had to ask what the fuck is wrong
Fuck your song (damn!) Man your bars is weak
I'll be out givin scars to cheeks, hard to speak
Bring me the hardest beats, start settlin in
Watch Ras start wearin 'em thin
Like, melted ice you felt it twice
Bet a joint like this never felt this nice
I paid the price (yeah) spent a lot of time lookin for chips
Still cookin up marvelous shit
Yo, peace to A's, we flipped the page
Have you run around yellin out "Jesus saves," yeah
Look above, you dudes is scrubs
When these niggaz really try to get down show 'em no love

[Chorus]</pre>
