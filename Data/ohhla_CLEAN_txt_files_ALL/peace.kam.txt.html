[ VERSE 1 ]
Hittin corners in a six-trey Chevrolet
Rag-top Impalla, top dollar
Got my cousin Laid-Back ridin shotgun
Cause I got the front-and-back hydraulic hot one
Juiced up, and I'm itchin to hit the switches
Crawlin over train tracks, avoidin all ditches
Ice-skatin on the 20-inch tires
Jack up the ass, and flex the gold dayton wires
Now I'm down to take a risk
Gettin geeked up off a compact disc
I went hoppin up Crenshaw, niggas hang loose
Lookin for my homies to celebrate the gang truce
And they about to throw a cook-out
So I'm puttin down the hump, we sailin on the look-out
For C.H.P., I was a teenage gee
So I'm readin a graffiti
The walls say 'peace treaty'

[ VERSE 2 ]
Lookin at the aftermath of the riot
I can still smell the ashes
&gt;From all the clashes
But quiet is kept, it wasn't just the blacks
Everybody was lootin, and had each other's backs
We came through in understandin, demandin
Justice, bust this, we all had our hand in
The cookie jar, took it far enough to make a statement
Daryl Gates - that's where all the hate went
We pass by a swap meet
Been shoppin at for years, but it couldn't stop heat
See ya, wouldn't wanna be your next door neighbor
Less government relief checks, more labor
10 percent blood suckers of the poor took a loss
For exploitation, had to show em who was boss
Teach em not to be so greedy
Had to shut em down, bound by a peace treaty

Bound by a peace treaty

[ VERSE 3 ]
Hit the park, bailed out the car
And seen blue and red everywhere, look how strong we are
Niggas showin up from this gang and that gang
Nobody set-trippin, cause it's a black thing
People just partyin, sippin on a cup
Some of the Compton F.O.I. even showed up
Suited and booted, kickin it with the locs
In unity, soon we'll be lovin all black foks
I heard Solo, bumpin in a Blazer
Clownin on a car phone, blowin up my pager
Watts-Up is on the set
Just checkin out the scenery, brothers I ain't never met
Is hittin me up, I had to swallow my pride
Just kept steppin, hit em up and said, "Right"
Ain't no drama, cause I'm mobbin with Laid-Back
I seen Big Jess, Jay and K-Mac
They used to work them narcotics
Like my nigga L-Wood and Renegade from the street products
We used to jack from the rich, and then give to the needy
But now it's a peace treaty

[ VERSE 4 ]
And now the party's acceleratin
The whole crowd bounce, and sho nuff celebratin
Ain't nobody bustin shots
I bumped into Mike a/k/a Mo' Like Watts
An O.G., cause he's older
Lovin every minute of it, with the camcorder on his shoulder
So he could capture the moment, and reminisce
I'ma always remember this
Because my niggas made the history books
And now the mystery looks
A lot clearer
The man in the mirror
Got power
It's now or
Never, more than ever
Black people have to stick together
But yo, let's hear it for the Bloods and the Crips
I gots to admit it
Y'all brothers did it
I just hope it don't cease
For the sake of all the homies that's restin in peace
