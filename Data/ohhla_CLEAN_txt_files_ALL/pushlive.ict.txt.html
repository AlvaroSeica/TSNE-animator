[Intro: DJ Evil E]
Yo, yo, yo Switzerland
Switzerland, yo man this is WHAT'S UP for a WHAT?
Yeah, yo man as I ?? up, Switzerland doesn't know this
And doesn't know what time it is man, you know what I'm saying?
I don't think they know what time it is
I wanna shoot man; the man with 50 grand that let Switzerland;
know what time it is, you know what I'm saying?
I want y'all to make some noise if y'all wanna know what time it is
Scream Switzerland, yeah
Yo baby, ??? throw this some high
Hit them with it

[Verse One: Ice-T]
Yo, it's time for me to pump the volume
No problem, the record is revolving
Evil is the mixer, I'm the rap trickster
Paparazzi is on the Bum Rush for pictures
Ice, cooling, yo, colder than ever
Punk executioner, E pulled the lever
Rotate the wax, then cut and x the tracks
Push up the levels 'til the red lights max
Don't try to size up, you better wise up
To the rap criminals, we're on the rise up
We're selling dope, til we're succeeded
Dope beats and lyrics, ain't no beepers needed (NEEDED!!)
For this drug deal, I'm the big wheel
The dope I'm selling, if you don't smoke you feel
Out on the dance floor, on my world tour
Selling dope in each and every record store
I'm the king pin when the wax spins (UHH!)
Crack or smack will take you to a sure end
You don't need it, just throw that shit away
You wanna get high? - Let the record play
Now, if you feel me out there, move your hands like this here
And everybody, we gonna sing along an old shit

[Chorus: DJ Evil E]
I'm your mama, I'm your daddy, I'm that nigga in the alley
I'm the brother, when you need, a true player to emcee
You know me, I'm your friend, your main boy, thick and thin

[Ice-T]
What's my name? (MC Ice-T!!)
And what do I do for the living?
Tell me? - I'm your.. PUSHER!!
Yeah, yeah, here's some fly shit
Check it out

[Verse Two: Ice-T]
I know you're loving this drugs as it's coming out your speaker
Bass through the bottoms, highs through the tweeters
But this base, you don't need a pipe
Just a tempo to keep your hype (UHH!!)
Grooving like I see you doing
Some stupid crack, would just ruin
Your natural high, why? - that ain't fly
And anyone who says it is (LIE!!)
Move like I knew you would, like I knew could
And if you ain't cracked out then, I know you should
Be able to give me a clap, to match exact with the track
But I know that you ain't, I expect that
Now this jam is lit, like the ultimate
People high off dope but still physically fit
Make a million buck, pack my dough in truck
From selling dope beats, dope rhymes, dope cuts
I'll be the biggest dope dealer in history
Cause all the fly will be high off that Ice-T
Show clap, show clap

[Chorus: Ice-T]
I'm your mama, I'm your daddy, I'm that nigga in the alley
I'm the brother, when you need, a true player to emcee
You know me, I'm your friend, your main boy...

[Outro: Ice-T]
What's my name? (MC Ice-T!!)
And tell these motherfuckers what I do for the living
I'm your.. PUSHER!! - YEAH!!</pre>
