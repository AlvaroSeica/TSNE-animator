Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Want a wrist like this, you gotta Bird talk
Expensive kicks like this, you gotta Bird talk
Drive whips like this, you gotta Bird talk
You want a bitch like this, you gotta Bird talk

Bird talking with them pigeons make them bitches fly to you
Looking like the police imma have to lie to you
Run up on me wrong, boy you don't wanna die do you
Them shooters at you head and they killing everybody who's riding with you
Gino got the pistol and we solving all these issues
In the field we play with missiles and these niggas soft as tissue
Savage squad wreckers man we the newer order
We kidnap your daughter catch a case I call my lawyer
Call up Pablo and place my fucking order
Everything's good long as he get across the border
44 ho and they ask for a quarter
44 ho and them ass for a quarter
Last week I'm at a club in Minnesota
All white foreign whips same color coca
All white foreign whips same color coca
I know this one Fein cause she's a very mad snorted

Want a wrist like this, you gotta Bird talk
Expensive kicks like this, you gotta Bird talk
Drive whips like this, you gotta Bird talk
You want a bitch like this, you gotta Bird talk

It's Fredo Santana Mr. Step up in the kitchen
I got what you want extra chicken with them biscuits
Just call my phone man you know that I deliver
I would be shit if it wasn't for my whipping
Bitches see me getting money and they wanna kick it
My neck is very cold man I think it's froze bitten
A nigga try me then he must've fucking lost it
I got goons I got goons better put you in the coffin
Bang on the lid then I put it in the soda
Buy a couple keys then I need some baking soda
I got toasters I got shooters that'll put on a poster
Keep my gun in my hand man I don't use a holster
War time, doing hits out a Toyota
Score when I'm shooting just like I'm supposed to
Savage squad, man these pussies can't control us
Savage squad, man you bitch wanna know us

Want a wrist like this, you gotta Bird talk
Expensive kicks like this, you gotta Bird talk
Drive whips like this, you gotta Bird talk
You want a bitch like this, you gotta Bird talk</pre>
