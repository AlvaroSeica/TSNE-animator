[Intro]
My homegirl told me I got an issue
With women with issues
I guess I got my own and I can relate to them, you kno
The irony in it
When you get what you want, you don't always want it

[Verse 1]
Temptation, I'm done waitin'
I'm done thinking, this ain't enough drinking
I'm in love with a lady who crazy
Maybe it's cause of the way the she praise me
I ain't used to it, she got that hot love
I try to lay low, she like to pop up
I try to make the most of it, beat the box up
I make the pussy wet, make the heart bust
Good pipe make a good girl to a good wife
Good morning wood, I just need a termite
Riding thru my hood tryna see where I'm at
She can't be in my face, then she be on my back
Like, "Where you at Wale?'
Or, "Where is that Wale?', "Who you with Wale?'
When I'm back, "You the shit Wale"
She crazy, that stalker shit
Everyone of her homegirls so talkative
No time for that, no acknowledgement
Think its time you and I need to call it quits
Look, need to call it quits
You be on that stalker shit
Look I tried to call it quits
Til' she came trench coat and a thong and shit
Woah

[Chorus]
I'm like a masochist
So lead me to the wall
I'm yours to own, you know
Don't be a pacifist
Cause girl it turns me on
Girl it turns me on

Girl I know you like that, you crazy
But I think I like that, just maybe
I ain't tryna fight back, but baby
If I go inside that, you'll hate me

Baby when I like that, I know it's crazy
Bite me and I bite back, and call it love
And you know I like that, you say you hate me
You bite me and I bite back, and call it love

[Verse 2]
Look
Temptation starting to sink in
As I indulge in an instinct I'm fadin'
I'm in love with a woman who crazy
Maybe it's because of the way she chase me
The more liquor around, the more I'm in love
The less clothes you, the less I want to talk
Maybe that throat she got have a nigga stuck
And I be putting it down, so she ain't giving up
She call a nigga too much cause she don't get enough
She never ready to go, so she forever come
I lick her up, she love it
I know I'm fucking up
I like it cause she a ten, but she say I'm the one
Like, "Settle down, Wale."
Look, "Right now, Wale.", "I'm in love, Wale."
"Guess I ain't nothing but a quick nut, Wale."
She crazy but I attract to it
All the insane bitches so passionate
What they lack in trust, they make up in lust
And it don't really make sense until the draws it off
She is far is all
I be leading her on
I be deeping her up, she said the D is a drug
Shawty fieining for love, I be feeding her lust
I be needing to leave, but I be needing to nut
Never need it enough

[Chorus]</pre>
