[Intro/Chorus: Grace Cook]
Coming around the mountain when she comes
Riding two white horses when she comes
Coming around the mountain when she comes
Get out on the dancefloor when she comes
Coming around the mountain when she comes
Riding two white horses when she comes
Coming around the mountain when she comes
Get out on the dancefloor when she comes

[Grace Cook]
Doing it! because we like it
Doing it! just for fun
Doing it! because we like it
Doing it! just for fun

[Chorus: Grace Cook]
Coming around the mountain when she comes
Riding two white horses when she comes
Coming around the mountain when she comes
Get out on the dancefloor when she comes
Coming around the mountain when she comes
Riding two white horses when she comes
Coming around the mountain when she comes
Get out on the dancefloor when she comes

[Grace Cook]
Doing it! because we like it
Doing it! just for fun
Doing it! because we like it
Doing it! just for fun

[George Clinton]
Standing on the mountain when she comes
Riding on the mountain when she comes
Coming around the mountain when she comes
Stand on the dancefloor when she comes
Riding around the mountain when she comes
Riding two white horses when she comes
Coming around the mountain when she comes
Riding two white horses when she comes

[Linda Brown]
Doing it! because we like it
Doing it! just for fun
Doing it! because we like it
Doing it! just for fun
Coming around the mountain when she comes
Riding two white horses when she comes
