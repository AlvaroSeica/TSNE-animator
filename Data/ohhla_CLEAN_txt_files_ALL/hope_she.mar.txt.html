[Intro: Fabolous]
You see Marsha, I don't know how you could feel a way?
I would never wish you no bad, we went our seperate ways
I would wish you the best...SYKE!!!!

[Verse One: Fabolous]
I hope he's cheatin on you with a fat wack silly hoe
Hope you see your boyfriend in a Kat Stacks video
Thought I found Cinderella shoe didnt fit her yo
Now I'm gonna have to trend topic you on Twitter though
Nah I ain't bitter, Ok I'm kinda bitter yo
Hope that cat shit on you, like you kitty litter though
Oh!!! Daddy tricked you to get your butt up
Uh Huh! OK! Whatever! SHUT UP!!!
Hope you catch him creepin, datin one of your friends
Get y'all both pregnant and y'all babies look like twins
Might say I'm hatin, well yes I'm hatin
Just thinkin 'bout it got me SMH'n

[Chorus: Marsha Ambrosius]
(Well look it how it all turned out now!!!)
I hope she cheats on you with a basketball player
(Look it how it all turned out now!!!)
I hope you feelin lonely baby now were not together
(Look it how it all turned out now!!!)
I hope she cheats on you with a basketball player
(Look it how it all turned out now!!!)
Oooh now that I'm without ya

[Verse Two: Marsha Ambrosius]
I hope she cheats on you with an NFL baller
She ignores you every single time you call her
Brand new Louis gotta have it spend your money on her
When you wanna hit it she actin like she don't wanna
I may sound bitter, I'm a little bitter
just a little bitter, because you were with her
I'm in Salt Lake City now I'm up on a pitcher
Remember how it was when I was with ya
Ba-by!!! Sex so good, do you remember? OH?
Ba-by!!! Sex so good, do you remember? OH?

[Chorus: Marsha Ambrosius] (*Maino)
(Well look it how it all turned out now!!!)
I hope she cheats on you with a basketball player
(Look it how it all turned out now!!!)
I hope you feelin lonely baby now were not together
(*Look at how it all turned out baby)
(Look it how it all turned out now!!!)
I hope she cheats on you with a basketball player
(*I'm feelin you)
(Look it how it all turned out now!!!)
(*But she ain't gonna do that) Oh now that I'm without ya baby!!!)
(*Maino!!!!!)

[Verse Three: Maino]
You don't wanna see me doin good you hopin that I be stressin
Up nights worried and hurt without restin
Wish I get embarrassed and stuck with no blessings 
Prayin that I feel what you felt without question
I'm tryin to touch the sky but you want me down
It's like the video she ended up with Shannon Brown
But that ain't goin down 'cause in real life
I'm the winner middle fingers in the air like
Yeah! You really startin to sound like a hater
My baby girl she would never leave me for a Laker
I'm sorry, I know that I'm the reason for the breakup
At times, I think back and wished that we had made up
'Cause I didn't mean to ever make you miserable
But girl, look at life from my point of view
I was young hard not to be a two timer
When girls, is screamin in my ear "Get 'em Tiger!!!"
So now with my new girlfriend
It is what it is this for you girlfriend
And even though you wish me bad I'm a wish you happiness
Look at how it all turned out you'll see what happy is

[Chorus: Marsha Ambrosius]
(Well look it how it all turned out now!!!)
I hope she cheats on you with a basketball player
(Look it how it all turned out now!!!)
I hope you feelin lonely baby now were not together
(Look it how it all turned out now!!!)
I hope she cheats on you with a basketball player
(Look it how it all turned out now!!!)
Oooh now that I'm without ya

[Bridge: Marsha Ambrosius]
She cute and all but that won't last forever
What I had for you was so much better
Yeah the grass ain't greener on the other side of town
Now look at how it all turns out now
I'm a little bitter, just a little bitter
but I'm doin better, 'cause we ain't together
You sorry excuse for somebody I was into
Remember what it was when I was with you

[Chorus: Marsha Ambrosius]
(Well look it how it all turned out now!!!)
I hope she cheats on you with a basketball player
(Look it how it all turned out now!!!)
I hope you feelin lonely baby now were not together
(Look it how it all turned out now!!!)
I hope she cheats on you with a basketball player
(Look it how it all turned out now!!!)
Now that I'm without ya baby!
