[Voice]
Ay you, Luke Skyywalker got a hit list out
And guess what? You're on it sucker
Hahahaha Ahahahaha Hahaha
Drop it

[Verse 1: Last Asiatic Disciple]
Land of the free, you see
Suzi is a big country singer
She's a hard rock slanger
And when she wants someone will bring her
It seems that her pimp Columbo
Always supplies her with a nice fat jumbo
And she puffs non stop, stimulating her brain
The president to her beat the street cop
Keeping the brain cells from growing the black
But relax to attack the crack

[Verse 2: Last Asiatic Disciple]
When you walk with your back to the sun
You fight for freedom with shadows
But, now life is in the saddle
To keep brothers facing the light
Showin' 'em wrong from right
So you can get a clear look at the fight
Now, I'm an anti-drug disciple
Devised by Professor Griff
We were put here to uplift
And explain the damage Suzi's doing to our nation
For example, education

[Voice]
Get off the snow white

(Chorus)
Suzi, Got to get this message to you
Suzi, I just got to get this message to you

[Verse 3: Last Asiatic Disciple]
Now grin like Oliver North did once before
But that ain't sayin' much to settle the score
And it did just enough imagine if
Freedom, Reagan, politics changin' in the Middle East
To say the least
The import must cease from this here malady
Limousines tellin' me what some don't know
As they use the crack pipe all the way to death row
Slammer, middle name Crime with the big guitar
And my civilization ain't what it used to be
And pollution of nation leaves us with no salvation
On top of all of this shit
She got them fiendin'!

[Verse 4: Last Asiatic Disciple]
On every block for miles
And like a slave, they're chained to a life of vials
Lookin' to steal to support that high stage
But unaware the undercovers are being paid
Not to squeal the deal that make the roads go
But to scheme of dreams and sell their own souls
Instead of sharin' and carin' to get self respect
Suzi had to hit to make the country sweat

[Voice]
Drop it Suzi

(Chorus)

[Verse 5: Last Asiatic Disciple]
You think it's simple
To send a black child to school
And only teach them about the golden rule, but
Professor Griff and the Disciples are not havin' that
And if you hang around Suzi you won't learn jack
I'm tired of this garbage and trying to explain
Don't blame it on yourself, 'cause Suzi is to blame
And if you know what I know
Listen, take heed, and try to go far
And let Suzi be a rock star

[Verse 6: Last Asiatic Disciple]
Countries claim to be aware, furthermore
Addressing issues but they really don't care
In fact, it was mentioned to blame it on a brother man
By the government who has the upper hand
To control your soul and the environment
'Cause Suzi's sellin', it and kids are buyin' it
To achieve with ease new sports cars
Suzi hooks the crowd 'cause she's a rock star

(Chorus)

[Verse 7: Last Asiatic Disciple]
In from Colombia comes a supporting cast
It hit the streets real fast
And everybody knew that Suzi was acting up again
Because the children were gettin' fed
Maybe what she's feeding them ain't food
The children might be gettin' screwed
Behind their backs Suzi's gettin' paid
In their front by settin' up a drug raid
Catching the little guys
While the big guys escape
'Cause they were caught hand fightin' with all States

[Verse 8: Last Asiatic Disciple]
I've been sworn by the oath that stands
To verbally and physically
The one who took a little time
To keep in mind a better path
So feel the wrath as I unwind
Many who struggle to comprehend just what
The man with the modern instinct is capable of
Wouldn't you love or can you understand
What the plan is
Makin' this tradin' stuff's going straight to your head
Pimps, pushers and suit and tie men
Whose lives were led
Chasin' bread through bloodshed
Tryin' to hide the truth and roots
Until a man screams
Someone shoots in to the realm of Suzi
Hahaha, 'cause she wants to be a rock star

(Chorus)

[Voice]
We're gonna kick you to sleep, America</pre>
