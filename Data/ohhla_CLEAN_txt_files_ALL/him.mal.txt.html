[Chorus]
Hear ye Him or hear Him not
You either fear me, or fear me not
I know you see clearly, I'm comin for that spot
So, you need to fear me like I fear God
Hear ye Him or hear Him not
You either fear me, or fear me not
I know you see clearly, I'm comin for that spot
So, you need to fear me like I fear God
Hear ye Him

[No Malice]
I shoulda been dead a LONG time ago
I offered death in almost er'ry line I wrote
Camouflaged it and act like I had offered hope
The gold chain was steady hangin, {niggaz} choked!
My older brother was my hero 'til he started dope
Wish I could've stopped his very first line of coke
But, I don't judge, we all got a guilty pleasure
And bless my momma heart, she still believe he gettin better
That's faith and er'ry man was dealt a measure
That's why I believe er'ry word in red letter
I ain't no better cause even I supplied 'em
For fifteen or twenty, I'd provide 'em
But, never deny the man that's steady gettin mad
At every time he begged for cash, I oblige 'em
My conscious is speakin kinda loud lately
Lord forgive me, I done killed my momma's baby

[Chorus]

[No Malice]
The Gospel's foolish to those who are perishing
They nod and dose, minus the heroin
The truth's obvious, maybe too evident
But clearly Malicious is something I should have never been!
Here's to the death of him, we gon' say a prayer
I gave y'all way enough time to prepare
For my second coming, that was the rehearsal
When the real second coming come, there is no reversal
Pusha, I'm the first to, admit I wanna see ya win
But when we die, I wanna know I'ma see you again
And to my baby, uh! I know I hurt you badly
For way lesser, I seen my momma leave my daddy
So I gladly, accept the fact you know I try
I guess that make you the wifey minus the "y"
I sigh, only cause I know the truth
YOLO?! +You Only Live Once+ if you choose to
