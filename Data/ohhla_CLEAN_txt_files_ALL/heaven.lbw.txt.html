Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Some people say that I'm blessed
Lately I've been feeling stressed
Just cause you see me wear all these diamonds shinning on my neck
Don't means I'm enjoying it, got [?] bitches lying them
Tired of my girl, going through my shit spying on me
I don't wanna be here, yeah, I know that sounds crazy
America, look at your boy, look what y'all mean
Nowadays, this police don't deserve a badge
It's 2011 and they still whopping our ass
They trying to lock my nigga [?] up for 5 years
I cried long even real niggaz shed tears
Because this bullshit I'm seeing got me bugged out
Looking out my living room window, wanting to jump out, ghost

Ah, can't find no piece on earth I'd rather be in
I know that I seeing, lord I gotta get to
I hope when I die I see everybody in, everybody in, everybody in
Ah, can't find no piece on earth I'd rather be in
I know that I seeing, lord I gotta get to
I hope when I die I see everybody in, everybody in, everybody in

I can't even talk to bitches, without these hoe snitching
Cause now your conversation turns to everybody bizness
Fuck you bloggers, I wonder how my pops feel
Probably sick to his stomach wishing he wasn't here
And I just make my money in peace, without your hating
Why is this so important to find out who I'm dating?
So what I smoke weed, just please, let me be me
I'm not that nigga you read about it or see on tv
I'm tired of pleasing you people who the fuck is you?
Stop compare me to these niggaz, they can't do what I do
If hell is on earth then fuck it I feel curse
As the days go back, it's worse

Ah, can't find no piece on earth I'd rather be in
I know that I seeing, lord I gotta get to
I hope when I die I see everybody in, everybody in, everybody in
Ah, can't find no piece on earth I'd rather be in
I know that I seeing, lord I gotta get to
I hope when I die I see everybody in, everybody in, everybody in [x2]</pre>
