[Intro: Yung Joc] + (T-Pain)
(Shawty snap)
T-Pain
(Damn, shawty snap)
Yung Joc
(Shawty snap)
Ay, ay, she snappin
(Snap ya fingers, do the step)
(You can do it all by yourself)

[T-Pain]
Baby girl, what's your name?
Let me talk to ya, let me buy you a drink
I'm T-Pain, you know me
Konvict Music, Nappy Boy, ooh-wee
I know the club, close at three
What's the chances of you rollin with me?
Back to the crib, show you how I live
Let's get drunk and forget what we did

[Chorus: T-Pain]
I'ma buy you a drank , I'ma take you home with me
I got money in the bank - shorty what'chu think 'bout that?
Find me in the grey Cadillac
We in the bed like ooh, ooh ohh, ooh, ooh {*2X*}

[Trey Songz]
What's your name? I'm Tremaine
I got game for days with these dames
Don't complain, stay in yo' lane
Pop champage with my nigga T-pain
V.I.P., G.I.B.
What'cha know about Louie the 13?
You ain't no stripper and I ain't in love
Let me give you a tip while we up in this club

[Chorus] w/ ad libs

[Yung Joc]
Wont you meet me at the bar, respect big pimpin
Tell me how you feel, momma tell me what you sippin
A certified dime piece, deserve Louie 1-3
150 a shot, three for you and three for me
I'm checkin your body language, I love the conversation
And when you lick your lips I get a tinglin sensation
Now we're both 'bout tipsy, you say you in the mood
All I need is 'bout a hour, better yet maybe two
Let me take you where I live, Ferrari switch gears
When I whisper in your ear, your legs hit the chandelier
Passion fruit and sex all in the atmosphere
I'ma let T-Pain sang it, so he can make it clear

[Chorus]

[repeat 2X]
Let's get gone, walk it out
(Now walk it out, think about it, awwww snap~!)
Now rock, rock, rock, rock
You can do it all by yo'self

[Chorus]</pre>
