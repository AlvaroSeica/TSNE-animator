[Intro: Sheek Louch]
L.O.X.! Damn baby make your mind up for real!
You 'gon love me or leave me alone?!

[Verse One: Sheek Louch]
Yo! When we first met you knew that I was still in the streets
Our first time at the movie I was carryin heat
First you didn't mind that I like to smoke
Drink alot of liquor made a livin off of baggin up coke
Hit-Hit that Louis store get two of whatever you want
Cop that speedy and that Louis monogram in the front
Then I-Then I got famous, signed with Puff
You was happy but still hatin my tours and stuff
Every bitch that I took a picture with, conspicuous 
Text message you ain't shit! And who is this?!
It was all love back in the days
Until I blew up, but you don't understand my ways
Huh!

[Chorus: Sheek Louch] (Styles P)
Aiyyo 'Kiss I got a girl that's bad, but she don't understand my ways
Arguin days after days after days, well I could dig it
Aiyyo Styles I got a girl that's bad, but she don't understand my ways
Arguin days after days after days (Well I could dig it) WOO!

[Verse Two: Styles P]
Mellow off the la la leave it is not a option
Cool like 'Melo and La La when we be rockin (Cool)
Shit get bad we like Stevie J and Joseline
Starin at the dolphins playin some Janice Joplin
Hotel balcony, O.T. arguin
See she ain't budgin nigga and I ain't bargainin
I'm-I'm so high forgot why we was arguin (So high!)
I'm just tryin to make up
Make love and fuck ya fuck and make love (Word!)
Then I'm chillin on the tub we bud to break up
Love her so much I ain't tryin to break up (Nah!)
But sometimes she be trippin the minute I wake up

[Chorus: Styles P] (Sheek Louch) (*Jadakiss)
Aiyyo Sheek I got a girl that's bad, but she don't understand my ways
Arguin days after days after days (Well I could dig it)
Aiyyo 'Kiss I got a girl that's bad, but she don't understand my ways
(*UH! UH!) Arguin days after days after days (*EH HEH!) Well I could dig it (WOO!)

[Verse Three: Jadakiss]
Sometime's the easiest way is just to let go (Let go)
Sex after the argument usually the best though (Yep)
Bringin up shit I did in the past that's stressful
It's all good though, as long as them checks flow
Know what they say when you search you find sum'n (True)
That groupie shit is old school, nine sum'n (Yep)
Sit down have a convo, mind fuck 'em (What's up?)
Packin my bags spend the rest of my time puffin (UH!)
I can take the bruisin not the accusin (Nah!)
The tact that your usin becomin amusin (Yeah!)
Screamin and shoutin, frown and poutin (UH!)
It ain't that hard just love me or be out then
What!

[Chorus: Jadakiss] (Styles P) (*Sheek Louch)
Aiyyo Styles I got a girl that's bad, but she don't understand my ways
Arguin days after days after days (Well I could dig it)
Aiyyo Sheek I got a girl that's bad, but she don't understand my ways
Arguin days after days after days (*Well I could dig it) WOO!
