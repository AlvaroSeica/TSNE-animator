[Intro: Inspectah Deck]
See I aint no hater, I'm a team player
I got family all over man, East, West, North, And the South
So this is what I'ma do for my dirty niggas

[Inspectah Deck]
N.Y. native but I'm known world wide
King size nigga, Dub dishes on the ride
I rhyme but I still be in the kitchen with them pies
And four or five do or die niggas on my side
Certified hustle, Still two four five
I gotta stay low I got the poe on my hide
Born wise, You could never blind my third eye
I'm House Gang banga, U.D.'s on the rise
Rhymes or the crime man, Got to get me mines
(Money on my mind) That's the sign of the times
Son I'm like a coffee bean stayin on the grind
Haters on the side line jealous of the shine
I came up straight from the grits and the grime
I'm hardcore, Sure to take a life over mine
I used to work Mickey D's back in eighty-nine
But now I'm gettin gwap just for droppin sick lines like...</pre>
