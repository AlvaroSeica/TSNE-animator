Now if it's cool in moderation
I found a way to pace it
I made it more acceptable my life and I ace it
I'm faded on occasion an abrasion to the clean cut
Blend it with my normal way of life and now I seem stuck
Even when I'm not blue I'm focused and I thank you
For opening that part of my brain I couldn't break through
Even though it's illegal while consuming
I participate in dangerous activities I'm dooming
My future longevity heavenly prospect
I think I have a good heart, I'd say I had a late start
People in my family have fallen to addiction
It's a mission uncontrollable you can't take the friction

[Eligh]
It fits together like bricks stacked in an orderly fashion
When I'm building up my confidence
Surrounding my controlled habitat
Split in two
Which rabbits the lie
Which holds the key to free
My destiny survive
Survival of the fittest it's the medicine
The key to free the mind
Subliminal intricate tricks put upon my being
Since the birth of a sorcerer came under the Pisces sign
Alcoholic rushing, gushing like rivers of gold
Holding my breath with the fish, early death is not a wish
I'm not Bronson but it haunts my conscience on the constant
Soaking up my compliments, one hand in the wonderland
One hand in the contraband
Underwater chase the rabbit to its destination
One hand on the pipe, one for the blunt
One for the medicine, one hand on the bottle
One for the door so they can let us in
One hand for the glass, one hand for the ass
One for the pad and pen
One for the mic control
See the rabbit gentlemen

[Bicasso]
They set it up for us
Put me on a planet of people, use these plants of love
Put Â‘em in they mouths and stuff
Tried it once to call a bluff and see the repercussions
Cuz the world is a petri dish, experimental hit and miss
And I'm a goldfish, underwater
Shake me some crystals that might change the color
Now look thru my lens, do you see how things are circular?
Pixilated pressure points directly when you hit the joint
Added it to what you had it stashed up in your liquor cabinet
Drank to wash down that sticky tablet
Stuck inside, you had to have it
Now go and get, cuz here it comes lifted
Euphoric brain liquid melt shifted felt good
Either you shouldn't or you should but you did
Either you shouldn't or you should so you did
This is a message for grown folks and kids
Who choose to chase the rabbit down these lives that we live

[Scarub]
The old lady gets upset when I touch the bottle
I promised I wouldn't touch the bottle minus special occasions
Yesterday she could tell I had a hang over
When asked what was the occasion I said because I could afford it
I was a shame how short the time was since my previous buzz
Didn't want to think about it, tried to swallow it all,
But that would only leave things unsettled causing nerves to shake
Like upset stomachs, avalanches and earthquakes
Not an uncommon occurrence but still hard to digest
The older I get the harder it is to fight
These addictive aggressive gravesites weighing me down
Squinting my eyes, gritting my teeth in disbelief
Or becoming what I always learned to hate
And some of us won't stop until we see with our own eyes
The self destruction, the coughing up of blood caught in the throat,
Infectious phlegm I'm trying to tell y'all
I know shit like this will be our down fall
If not the actual sickness then the mind state that we're in
Seeing is believing
But at time, what is seen is a sign of it being too late
A sign of it being too late

[The Grouch]
Now I've been to the depths of the steps of that other place
Turned back and learned that here is where I love to race
When in the face of reality I kiss it
If I fuck off relations, know that I'm gonna miss it
Visit with it, live it, give it all of Grouch,
Unzip it like a pouch and let it all hang out
As if no one was watching, I ain't botching up the job
God, never that, help me with a better act
Knack embedded, I manipulate in any state
Weather sober or faded to where I can't see straight
I motivate, elevate, activate, tell it great, take it farther
Growin' larger on the daily off a chill pill
Although the thrill will call
Face it, life in this matrix is raw
Pace it, pace it y'all</pre>
