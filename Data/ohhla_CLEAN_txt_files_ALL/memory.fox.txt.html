[VERSE 1]
Damn the rap game done changed
Everytime I turn around niggaz spittin' nigga's names
'96 was when the love was real
When Big came and took the whole Brooklyn to fame
Straight off of St. James
Lookin' all Dapper Don, he threw a party and bullshit, it was on
And, B.I.G. spot'll never be claimed
'Cuz Mrs. Wallace, Cease and Roc carry his name
And later on in '96 when Hovi came and
"Ain't No Nigga" was the key to his fame
Introducin' a little Brooklyn girl by the name of Fox Brown
About to shut this rap shit down and
To the world we was Bonnie &amp; Clyde
And everything my nigga Jay said I'm ready to ride
Then "I'll Be" came to skyrocket our fame
And 2 million sales later bet I rode the same

[CHORUS 2x] (Notorious B.I.G. from "Things Done Changed")
Remember back in the days when niggaz had waves
New Gazellie shades and corn braids
Take you niggaz on a trip straight to Memory Lane

[VERSE 2]
Then Nas came and The Firm was born
We snatched AZ and Mega and our team was born
I took 'em on Puff tour, turn around Nas gone
And the whole crew follow, what a hard pill to swallow and
I had to thug it out and go in the zone
And rock 30 thousand on my muhfuckin' own but
I couldn't break down, I couldn't moan
I got this Ill Na Na blood in my veins, I spar alone!
Then 4 weeks later Puff ended at home at the Garden
The show I came up on the throne
See I...Can't believe my niggaz left me alone
And I don't buy the shit about Puff was treatin' 'em wrong
How the fuck we tryna pull weight on this man tour?
At the time Puff 8 mil, the fuck you mad for?
That's the problem wit niggaz, see they worse than broads
Want a bitch to conceal they scars, yeah

[CHORUS 2x] (Notorious B.I.G. from "Things Done Changed")
Remember back in the days when niggaz had waves
New Gazellie shades and corn braids
Take you niggaz on a trip straight to Memory Lane

[VERSE 3]
It's called the vapors
Soon as you stack some paper
These cowards got the nerve to face ya
They got the gall to page ya
How the fuck you have a lil' soldier and replace her wit a dozier
But like I told ya Fox is a trooper
I'll walk straight pass ya like I never fuckin' knew ya
Listen man I'm he first bitch to sign to Def Jam
How can't I be the best, I'm from the best man
'97 was the year Kim came wit her best plan
To go straight at her best friend
I thought it was a cute lil' spar
'Till I heard her on the Flex tape describin' my car
Mo' money, mo' problems, kid
I guess you never did expect me to blow this big and
I know my fans won the battle I fought
But understand I keep her breathin', I'm her life support

[CHORUS 2x] (Notorious B.I.G. from "Things Done Changed")
Remember back in the days when niggaz had waves
New Gazellie shades and corn braids
Take you niggaz on a trip straight to Memory Lane</pre>
