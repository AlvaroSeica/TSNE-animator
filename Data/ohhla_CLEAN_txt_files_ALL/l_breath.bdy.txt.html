[Intro: Ice-T]
Oooooohhh am I dreaming?
Oooooohhh am I dreaming?
Am I alone?
Oooooohhh am I dreaming?
Am I alone?

[Verse One: Ice-T]
Yeah
I like to wait 'til late night, til you motherfuckers sleep
I crawl in through your window, and I motherfucking creep
I catch you little punk ass kids asleep in your beds
And I take out my knife and I cut off your motherfucking heads
I want your last breath
I want your last breath

[Interlude: Ice-T]
You're not dreaming, you're not alone
You're not dreaming, you're not alone
Ha HA HA HHHHAAAAAAA! ~ Ha HA HA HHHHAAAAAAA!!!
OHHHHHHHH, I want your last breath
Your last breath, your last breath
I want your last breath

[Verse Two: Ice-T]
So you go to downstairs to see if everything is alright
You're afraid, you're alone and it's late on a rainy night
Are you asleep or awake? you don't know as you turn around
And my rusty blade cuts you open, let you hit the ground
I want your last breath
I want your last breath

[Outro: Ice-T]
You're not dreaming, you're not alone
You're not dreaming, you're not alone
Ha HA HA HHHHAAAAAAA! ~ Ha HA HA HHHHAAAAAAA!!!
OHHHHHHHH, I want your last breath
Your last breath, your last breath
I want your last breath
You're not dreaming</pre>
