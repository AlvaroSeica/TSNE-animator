(But I thought it was 80 - that's it)
(Flash and Melle Mel)

[Rev Run]
Aiyyo tips and toes-es, and fly poses
I resurrect and respect like I'm Moses
Flows is boast-es, +Def+ just like +Mos+ is
And caked out like Rev just bought Hostess
Run got a rhyme designed like seven-nine was
I come to flip the script and change time cuz'
Go, here we go, here we here we here we made it
I take it back 'fore flattops was faded
Way before the laptop created
But now it's on and back and y'all played it

[Chorus: Blondie "Rapture" samples]
And you don't stop - it's the sure shot
Francois c'est faux, Flashe' no deux
And you don't stop - it's the sure shot
Take a tour, take a tour
And you don't stop - it's the sure shot
Francois c'est faux, Flashe' no deux
I said don't stop, do punk rock

[more samples - The Monkees "I'll Spend My Life With You"]
"Played a game that couldn't last, an ounce of memories from the past"
"The life I thought I wanted is today..."

[Rev Run]
Aiyyo back by choices, and my voice is
on point just like a Rolls Royce is
Noises, boys is poison with toys-es
Caked out and Run be the moist-est
Run got a rhyme designed like seven-nine was
I come to flip the script and change time cuz'
Go, here we go, here we here we here we nitro
That nigga Run insure you like Geico
I 'member Flash and Mel rocked the night yo
And back then them boys was like nitro

[Chorus]</pre>
