[Intro]
Trigga Tribe
Take it from the top of the titty! (Not the nipple)
You will only hear this, in yo' top {?}
Sa-LUTE! (He's banned from us)
Lord Jesus Christmas...

[Chorus]
Industry Rule #100 is funny
Tall midgets get short money!
Industry Rule #100 is funny
Tall midgets get short money!

[Treach]
Don't bite the hand that feed you, that's exciting fightin
Shoulda done Celebrity Ghost Stories for all my ghostwritin
I can't, fire the owner cause it's me and my DJ
Get a grown-man time-out, I'm out, buy my swag on eBay
Cash I, get it, grab it, feel the punishment from the savage
Legend lyrical lord they call you Uncle Ad-Lib
Harlem Shake shook off f'real, you so breezy!
Starvin for press, that's why he went and wiggled his wee-wee
My, back-up plan is fuck a back-up man, I'm back
Need to call my nigga Busta, buy Spliff Starr off his contract
Never last ya joke, better DIP the yoke
I'm everlasting, bro! Ya ghetto PASS revoked
Chorus

[Chorus]

[Treach]
Stop bitchin, stop trippin, stop riffin
I'm not listen, stop listen, stop sniffin
You out of my army, can't harm me, or alarm me
Fuck ya fat-ass, you a bagel away from Barney
You wack rapper, backstabber, so greedy
I'll make it so they'll never see yo' wack-ass on TV, eat me!
Time to find yo' own zone, watch yo' tone
Naughty Gear, was niggaz throwin you a bone, homes
I hate the leech lurkin off of what I build
Cause I real, now I'm doin side deals that I feel
Many of dudes, love the end of the groove
It's the ending of you, Mr. Winnie the Pooh 
Chorus
