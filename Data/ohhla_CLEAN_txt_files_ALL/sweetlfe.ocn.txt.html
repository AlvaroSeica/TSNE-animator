Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Frank Ocean]
The best song wasn't the single, but you weren't either
Livin in Ladera Heights, the black Beverly Hills
Domesticated paradise, palm trees and pools
The water's blue, swallow the pill, keepin it surreal, whatever you like
Whatever feels good, whatever takes your mountain high
Keepin it surreal, not sugar free
My TV ain't HD, that's too real
Grapevine; mango, peaches and limes, the sweet life

[Interlude]
The sweet life, sweet life
Sweet life, sweet life
The sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet life
Sweet life, the sweet life
Sweetie pie

[Chorus]
You've had a landscaper and a housekeeper, since you were born
The starshine always kept you warm
So why see the world, when you got the beach?
Don't know why see the world, when you got the beach - the sweet life

[Frank Ocean]
The best song wasn't the single, but you couldn't turn your radio down
Satellite need a receiver
Can't seem to turn the signal fully off
Transmitting the waves; you're catchin that breeze 'til you're dead in the grave
But you're keepin it surreal, whatever you like
Whatever feels good, whatever takes your mountain high
Keepin it surreal, not sugar free, my TV ain't HD, that's too real
Grapevine; mango, peaches and limes, the sweet life

[Interlude]
A sweet life
A sweet life, yeah
A sweet life, a sweet life
A sweet life
Live and die in the life

[Chorus]

[Frank Ocean]
And the water, is exactly what I wanted
It's everything I thought it would be (thought it would be)
But this neighborhood is gettin trippier every day
The neighborhood is goin ape shit crazy

[Chorus]</pre>
