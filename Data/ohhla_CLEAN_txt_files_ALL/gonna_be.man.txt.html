[INTRO]
(Yeah)
Ooh Yeah, you should've never messed with the Macho
Man Randy Savage dude (that's right) You're in trouble now

[CHORUS]
Oh No! Ya better watch yourself cuz I'm bad for your health
And I'm about ready to blow
Uhhh Oohh!! Now There's Gonna Be Trouble!
Oh No! Ya better watch yourself cuz I'm bad for your health
Ya feelin' the wrath of Macho
Uhhh Oohh! Now There's Gonna Be Trouble

[VERSE 1]
Everybody wants to talk shhh.... I heard it all before
But by the time I'm done with you you're layin' flat on the floor
I'm the Macho Man Number 1 exterminator
Ya see my come your way you better say your prayers
I'm sick and tired of all the speculation
You talked that junk now you're a hospital patient
I told you before dat Randy ain't playin'
Now you're all swoled up that's the price you're payin'
You're sayin' sorry but it's too late now
Cuz I dissed ya and dismissed ya like a bastard child
(Boom Bow) you're knocked out and don't know how
Takin' Shh....from you chumps is something I don't allow

[CHORUS]

[VERSE 2]
You're in trouble now dude cuz talkin' a lot
of Shhh ain't my style dude
But you always wanna run off at the mouth dude
I'm about to show you what I'm all about dude
I'll knock you out dude
I can't believe the gall of all these wrestlin' cowards
Cuz they all know the Macho Man got the power
Even though you haven't seen me in the ring for awhile
I'll still kick ya butt and walk away with a smile
That's my style I let my fists do the talkin'
So don't even think about it dude keep walking
All you new dudes I'm about to bust ya bubble
Cuz when the Savage comes back you're all in TROUBLE

[CHORUS]

[VERSE 3: Smokke rap]
(Uh huh) Smokke, this is Macho Bad
Smokke and the Macho Man look homey I am not your man
Watch what ya say before the ----go bam
and if I miss partner Ya better watch your fam, got a savage
named Randy who is not for playin'
A heckler and kotch that I cop for sprayin'
A whip with a top I can drop when I tan
And if you get spotted, better start your prayin'
Messin' with me dog you ain't got no name
And worse case scenario you got no change
I curse through the stereo &amp; rock your brain
Smokke and Macho Man it's not no game

[CHORUS]

[OUTRO]

Macho Man Randy Savage baby he ain't playin'
he comin' at ya like this
