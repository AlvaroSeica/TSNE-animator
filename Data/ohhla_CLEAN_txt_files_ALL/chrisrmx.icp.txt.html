[Intro]
A catastrophic demise (A catastrophic demise){4X}
Unmeasurable regrets (Unmeasurable regrets) {2X}
 
[Violent Jay]
Shit builds up, fills up
Too much goes over board
(What the fuck am I doing?!)
Oh Lord, pressure stored 
Ex-PLODED, unloaded
(What the fuck am I doing?!)
I had to, it's really too bad, too
Went cuckoooooo! (Gone mad dude) 
Grab at and STAB fools!! (Who knew?)
Sad news (What the fuck am I doing?!)
I-I I-I-I I, broke
It took some time, slow poke
I finally gave way, went under deep (Don't float)
No longer steering, choosing
On-on-on autopilot cruisin-n-n
Haywire, crash, virus
Pull your tongue out with pliers, CHRIS BENOIT!!
 
[Chorus]
No longer steering (No longer steering)
Lost all control (Lost all control)
Manipulation (manipulation), it won't let me go! (won't let me go)
The pain exploded (the pain exploded), the pressure burst (the pressure burst)
I drop the wheel (I drop the wheel), headed for the worst! (for the worst)
Headed for the worst (I'm Chris Benoit) {The Crippler} 
Headed for the worst! (for the worst)
Headed for the worst (I'm Chris Benoit) {The Crippler}
Headed for the worst!
 
[Ice Cube]
Crazy, yeah..
You're playin Tic Tac Toe wit a tickin, timebomb
Y'all mother-FUCKERS don't know what his mind's on
(Pressure) Make him hard as a dia-mond
Sinner sinner 'bout to get his fuckin crime on
Y-Y-Y-Yep-yep, he was liked by the neighbors
This motherfucker got 31 favors
(The World's Best Dad) They say he's the greatest
But a drunk-ass hoe when you see him out in Vegas
..He's acting rather odd
This motherfucker's gettin sick of the fa√ßade
and workers takin losses
And if you didn't know, he's got horrible bosses
{BOSSES, bosses} So what's the diagnosis?
When you can't sleep and you start hearin voices
{voices, voices} He's got too many chores
Might kill his whole family, MIGHT KILL YOURS!
 
[Chorus]
 
[Shaggy 2 Dope]
Strobelight, let go! Hold tight
Wake up to this, cold sight
You did this! This YOU!
(What the fuck am I doing?!) You got issues
What happened? Shit, I'm snappin
All bloody, myself I'm slappin
One day, all the sudden it
all became too much, wouldn't it?
YES-S-S-SS, finally released
(What the fuck am I doing?!) Unleash the beast
Eject my controller 
(What the fuck am I doing?!) Took me over
Ha-Ha-Had to - it's really too bad, too
Went cuckoooooo! (Gone mad dude) 
Grab at and STAB fools!! (Who knew??)
Sad news, I'M CHRIS BENOIT!!!
 
[Chorus]
 
[Scarface]
We can die tonight, I don't give a fuck-fuck
Push that button, I'ma blow shit up
Fuck the world, kill the kids
Fuck the courtroom, I ain't finsta live
What I'm hearin here is Satan's voice
Then I {?}, make ya choice
Blood on my hands, I can taste your pain
Head's so open I can pick your brain
Shit then change, love bizarre
Don't we all want to love a star?
Well here I are, stab ya pick-pick-pick
But after this, I'm stick his bitch
And stick his bitch!! AND STICK HIS BITCH!!
Ever seen a man mad? Well, this is it (Hahaha!)
What's in my head? I'm a zombie now
At the end of the act, we can all take bow
 
[Chorus]
 
[Outro]
On any given night
I can take you out, permanently
Because life is about pain
I'm The Crippler, Chris Benoit
A catastrophic demise (A catastrophic demise) {4X}
Headed for the worst {The Crippler} (Unmeasurable regrets)
Headed for the worst! (Unmeasurable regrets)
Headed for the worst {The Crippler} (Unmeasurable regrets)
Headed for the worst! (Unmeasurable regrets)
{The Crippler, Th-th-the Crippler}
Unmeasurable regrets (Unmeasurable regrets) {2X}</pre>
