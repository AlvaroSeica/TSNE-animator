Typed by: dynospectrum@gmail.com

Southern California underground funk assassin
Known to blast the competition
Break 'em up like New Edition
I'm gonna rob you, throb you, rip you with mics
And make you question your commitment like my dicks in your wife
And I'm hittin' it right
Now how's that for a visual to make your brain stall
Your old ball and chain now chained to my wall
I'mma reign 'till I fall, when I do I'll get a stunt double
Like to play it smart so I hump when there's trouble
While you try to go for broke with them punks in your huddle
I play Voldermolt and bring the magic to the muggles
Just dove in the struggle
Not waitin' waist deep
Lickin' kicks off the snairs while you suckas waste beats
Lose your hunger for success once you taste defeat
So I'mma show you how to eat
You gotta let it wet your appetite
Spit it out and rap just tight
Keep a sense of humor and just kick back and laugh at life

[Chorus]
(It'll drive you crazy)
If you let it take over
Have you stressed to the point where you can't stay sober
(It'll drive you crazy)
If you let it take over
Got me stressed to the point where I can't stay sober
(It'll drive you crazy)
If you let it take over
Got me stressed to the point where I can't stay sober
(It'll drive you crazy)
If you let it don't forget it
Take control of your life or you just might regret it

That's how I got these panic attacks and frantical raps
Thats cold as a chick mixed hispanic with black
But still spit it so hot they'll have to ban it from wax
Or at least press it on that heavy european shit
So you can't want beef when you're a vegan bitch
Props to BLX, I hope y'all see them checks
I'm uppin' woman from the back like a CRX
And real heads can stop waitin' cuz WE are next
Def J-U-X and Living Legends coming through when I play two sets
Like Shock G and D.U. don't know the half about blowin' up
I call you see too
Treat it like an opening act of movie preview
'Cause everybody in the house came to watch what we do
Since your rhymes are as fly as a fuckin' Emu
So even if I only make MTV2
It's better than me stuck in a rut being you

[Chorus]
(It'll drive you crazy)
If you let it take over
Have you stressed to the point where you can't stay sober
(It'll drive you crazy)
If you let it take over
Got me stressed to the point where I can't stay sober
(It'll drive you crazy)
If you let it take over
Got me stressed to the point where I can't stay sober
(It'll drive you crazy)
If you let it don't forget it
Take control of your life or you just might regret it

Quit letting your girl run you life and
Homie be a man
Your ladies not supposed to be your one and only fan
Or your manager
That's a conflict of interest
I expect nothing less from a product of incest
I been fresh
Since my first song in '92
When I got with 3MG we put it down since high school
So mother fuckers, know, how, I, do
I shove this mic down your throat and start speaking into you
And my mic sounds nice, check one
I can sing in the middle of this verse just for fun
Like, "la la la la laaa"
I know it's off key but when Oh No's on the beat
He can make something even that vile seem sweet
As revenge on your ex-girlfriend who fucked your best friend
While you were drunk passed out in your den
So while you were downin' Hen(essy)
She was goin' down on him

[Chorus]
(It'll drive you crazy)
If you let it take over
Have you stressed to the point where you can't stay sober
(It'll drive you crazy)
If you let it take over
Got me stressed to the point where I can't stay sober
(It'll drive you crazy)
If you let it take over
Got me stressed to the point where I can't stay sober
(It'll drive you crazy)
If you let it don't forget it
Take control of your life or you just might regret it</pre>
