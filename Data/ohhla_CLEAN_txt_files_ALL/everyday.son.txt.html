If I were to love and cherish you
try not to embarrass you
always want to share with you
tell me would you love me everyday
everyday everyday everyday everyday everyday everyday

If I were to hold you and kiss you long
always wanna sing along
give up all these sad songs
tell me would you love me everyday
everyday everyday everyday everyday everyday everyday

If you were to trust me and hold me tight
try not to make a fight
bring your bag and stay the night
And I would love you everyday
everyday everyday everyday everyday everyday everyday

If you were to keep a smile on my face hit me up on my space
just end up at my place
I would love you everyday
everyday everyday everyday everyday everyday everyday

If I were to take you to Costco
And the pigeon john show
And then to McDonald's tell me would you love me everyday
everyday everyday everyday everyday everyday everyday

If I were to buy tickets on eBay
to go see Le Tigre would you be my baby
or maybe just love me everyday
everyday everyday everyday everyday everyday everyday

If you were to just tell me everything
I can handle anything
I messed up many things
I would still love you everyday
everyday everyday everyday everyday everyday everyday

even if your friends try and talk about us
they don't know enough about us
their just mad cause they don't have us and our attention
everyday everyday everyday everyday everyday everyday everyday

If I were to kick back on the drama
be nice to your mama have you in my palma
And I would love you everyday
everyday everyday everyday everyday everyday everyday

If I was to never ever hurt you or to desert you
And feed dessert too
would you love me everyday
everyday everyday everyday everyday everyday everyday

If you were to let me watch my raider game
let me watch my dodger game
let me watch my laker game
And I would love you everyday
everyday everyday everyday everyday everyday everyday

If you were to tell me that you miss me
kiss me kiss me kiss me
be here to assist me
And I would love you everyday
everyday everyday everyday everyday everyday everyday

If I were to love and cherish you
try not to embarrass you
always want to share with you
tell me would you love me everyday
everyday everyday everyday everyday everyday everyday

If I were to hold you and kiss you long
always wanna sing along
give up all these sad songs
tell me would you love me everyday
everyday everyday everyday everyday everyday everyday

If you were to trust me and hold me tight
try not to make a fight
bring your bag and stay the night
And I would love you everyday everyday everyday everyday everyday
everyday everyday

If you were to keep a smile on my face
hit me up on my space
just end up at my place
I would love you everyday
everyday everyday everyday everyday everyday everyday</pre>
