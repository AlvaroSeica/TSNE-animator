[Hodgy Beats]
Moms said I'm crazy, and then she kicked me out
I used that motivation, for shit to spit about
2000 YM, 3000 dollar lamb
I'm comin from the gutter, now where my food stamps?
I smell the scent of collars, now where's my fuckin gramps?
No money in the bank - only in my pants
Countin 'nuff dollars like the pole when the strippers dance
Take today serious cause some niggaz don't get the chance
I consider me lucky
Got these haters on us like the puffy, stuffing
goes inside the chickens that are clucking
I be like that iPhone, your girl wanna touch me

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
I've got it {*3X*} you've got it

[Hodgy Beats]
Man they put me out (out) man they put me out
A man is in the mail, if you got a pussy out
Wolfin on the couch, ambushin at the mouth
Slut want comfort and them cushions on the couch
I'ma get up and chase that money
A bumblebee with polishin to make that money
I can't be tall, and shrink like a midget
She can't give me her money and not not call them digits
He lives in anxiety, he twitches and he fidgets
If he don't tell you a story, ask his homey Bridget
And Bridge is like a down-ass hoe
But a woman that knows his story won't tell a soul
cause what you reap you will sew, karma only grows
Carmen only knows when she's ridin in that BM
Mercedes come around when money grow like a Chia
Visa for Mona Lisa with this hiccup, drink up~!
