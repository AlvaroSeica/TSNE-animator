Yea
Streetz &amp; Young Deuces
The Mill's Finest
ROCK.........Wit us
Come on
Uh huh yea
Come on
Uh huh
Let's Go....

[Streetz Verse]
I said nobody do it like we do it
Ride through, Mirror tint can't see through it
If shorty wanna ride tell her hop in (Hop in)
Seat Back finna get it poppin' (poppin')
Uh, Mill Fitted, Yep I'm mill wit it
They Said Mil-Town ain't hot, The Mill Did it
Shades on when it's dark outside
Don't mind me I be frontin' sometimes
Young Dude, doin' old school moves
Logic to Pro Tools I done paid my dues
So it's only right chicks love my swag
I'm only 19, so my pants gone sag
Mall Like my playground
It ain't nothing when you see us poppin tags now, you doin' bad now
It's all good girl gone get low
And I'ma tell ya sumthin' that you already know

[Chorus]
**Scratches*** I'm Fresh
Hat low, jewels gleaming', Oh Yes!!!
We be on da dance floor not to break a sweat
Step once to the right, once to the left (GET EM UP NOW!!!)
**Scratches*** I'm Fresh
Hat low, Jewels Gleaming, Oh Yes!!!
We be on da dance floor not to break a sweat
Step once to the right, once to the left (GET EM UP NOW!!!)

[Young Deuces Verse]
I'm the best to ever do it, Yes ya boys clean
Hat match's da sneaks and da jewelry so mean
Can't believe Young Deuces only 19
My fit da flyest thing you done ever seen
800 makes ya lean, and bounce like a 6-4
You lame dudes get gassed up like Citgo
I understand you be hatin' a lot
You work full time still ain't makin' a lot
I'm a hustla, I come and throw base on da block
That's why I flood so many diamonds in the face off my watch
You got no street smarts, you'll waist on da block
Da type dat'll go and try to sell base to a cop
Listen homie you ain't fresh as me, I'm da best they see
My Cologne got them thinkin' they on ecstasy
So why you tryna stand next me
Man you need to back down
Let me put my mack down
I'm FRESH

[Chorus]
**Scratches*** I'm Fresh
Hat low, Jewels Gleaming, Oh Yes!!!
We be on da dance floor not to break a sweat
Step once to the right, once to the left (GET EM UP NOW!!!)
**Scratches*** I'm Fresh
Hat low, Jewels Gleaming, Oh Yes!!!
We be on da dance floor not to break a sweat
Step once to the right, once to the left (GET EM UP NOW!!!)

[Breakdown]
Now I don't know where you from
But where we from, we be rocking' (Rocking', Rocking') (GET EM UP NOW!!!)
So if you in da club, stand up
Cause you know we gone get it poppin (Poppin, Poppin) (GET EM UP NOW!!!)
Now I don't know where you from
But where we from, we be rocking (Rocking, Rocking) (GET EM UP NOW!!!)
So if you in da club, stand up
Cause you know we gone get it poppin (Poppin, Poppin) (GET EM UP NOW!!!)

[Chorus]
**Scratches*** I'm Fresh
Hat low, Jewels Gleaming, Oh Yes!!!
We be on da dance floor not to break a sweat
Step once to the right, once to the left (GET EM UP NOW!!!)
**Scratches*** I'm Fresh
Hat low, Jewels Gleaming, Oh Yes!!!
We be on da dance floor not to break a sweat
Step once to the right, once to the left (GET EM UP NOW!!!)
**Scratches*** I'm Fresh, Fresh
**Scratches*** I'm Fresh **Scratches***  Fresh **Scratches***  Fresh</pre>
