[Mecca]
Yo Pack, you see that cat playin' you close, son?
[PackFM]
Where?
[Mecca]
Right there, son!
[PackFM]
Oh man, what?!
[Mecca]
Son, you know we don't allow that
[PackFM]
Yeah, we gonna take him out tonight, son
[Mecca]
No doubt.

[Hook]
Take a walk with me, we goin all city
Black hat, gloves, flat black's all you need
Krylon, Rusto', a Pilot, a silver Touch Tone
My name is famous, my face - unknown
{*2X*}

[Verse 1]
This is how it goes, late night, early AM
Sky's pitch black, reach in the bag, Click-Clack
Then I start sprayin'
Paint the wall red, before the cap hits the floor
I'm runnin' from the law
There's a alley closeby, I can tell by the stench
Shortcut to the park, I'm hidin' under the bench
First my kicks was muddy, now all my gear, too?
...Shhh - somebody might hear you
Can't make a sound, cuz they just might find me
Can't move an inch, there's dog shit right behind me
Damn! This shit is grimey
It's like I'm an A&amp;R and all these walls are rappers screamin' out "Sign Me"

Hold up - gotta let these pigs pass..

[Cop 1]
He's gotta be here somewhere, we gotta catch his ass
[Cop 2]
Eh, so what? It's just a bunch of paper work
[Cop 1]
You know what? You're right, and I'm tired. Let's go get some donuts

Cops got tired of waitin', no match for my patience
I think I'll be safe and head in to the train station
And you know I ain't payin', but no need for creepin'
This time of night the lady in the booth is always sleepin'
9 times outta 10, the platform is empty
Poles freshly painted and it really looks tempting
But tonight I got a feeling like somebody's out to get me
I reach for my marker, but my instincts won't let me
White guy, by himself - don't care when the train's comin?
Just don't add up, allow me to explain somethin'
This guy's an undercover, disguised to bring you under
No lies, I seen 'em hover, Just tryin to warn you, brotha
Here comes the train, dip into the last car
Put my name everywhere, even where the maps are
And nothin' leaves a mark like Griffin Shoe Polish
By the time we hit the next stop, the whole car's demolished
Time to exit proceed with a purpose
My canvas, a surface most people deem as worthless
Pop the krylon top, no need to steal, I purchase
You find that funny? I'm spendin' rap money
Anyway, cop a squat, got a nice spot - the rooftop
Won't stop till the sun's up and my name's seen from 2 blocks
You know what they say, fame is the name of the game
So clear the way when you hear the click, clack, and the spray

[Hook]
