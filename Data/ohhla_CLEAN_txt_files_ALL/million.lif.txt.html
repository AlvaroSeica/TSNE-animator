Lifestyle with no heat baby
I told em a one in a million to work on a billion and before trillion
Truck dealing smokin looking for a way out
In and out the stash house from the South
Move cross the mouse when we walk we proud when we talk we growlin
Bout my rappin that's style check the bitch don't check the dip
I know you heard don't fuck with him that's that damn Mexican
And we don't want no pexican makin more than a minimum
Runnin trough the new millenium grabbin the mic and wreckin them
Wreckin them off and checkin em  unload the ship break the brick
I test the dope then lick my lips gotta take a trip then make a lick
Make a hit I aint afraid of shit watch my candy flip 
as I hit the streets smokin on hydro stay a lid smokin on my snits
til my fingertips ignite yourself while I'm livin then 
get in a grip and disturb the dent 
I'm workin in when I'm earnin in so bounce on in 
Get on in ride a dick get a playa hit

million dollar stars find us at the bar 
flossin in our cars cause you know who we are
million dollar stars find us at the bar 
flossin in our cars cause you know who we are

Money gives me power power and money create stars
Everywhere I go fingers pointed at my fancy cars
all I realize is to do is just keep flickin and givin my best
bring the snow and the pain and the real for the foes and the rest
cause money make quick while this other niggas life
Don't name names just kept inside pop trunks post cause livin high
Always tell other till the day I die
Time to keep packin neighborhoods welfare
Take world's express gonna take you there
Sit back on your ass why stare 
I don't give a fuck if my boys don't care
Livin in G role island demma block flakes
Around me I'm so hot it's look at every face
Potential plot choices I face I would escape if I could 
There's nowhere to go so ill b 
providin crack cocaine for my neighborhood 
Scream out in pain for the game while you let em know 
Why ever playing in castoris and bathing in white snow white snow

million dollar stars find us at the bar 
flossin in our cars cause you know who we are
million dollar stars find us at the bar 
flossin in our cars cause you know who we are

soy un pistolero yo no tengo miedo
I hit the fucking callez gettin ready for some pedo
Let's get this shit zero lace con pedro fumo mariguana y
me pongo bien pendejo menso no quieres saber las cosas
que llo pienso lla es tiempo for the mexicanos to come up in
This juego luego aser dinero quiero ser millionario
Driving around my town in a nice forricado 
with the house on the lago aya en el lado tirando 
el dedo and chunking up my cuernos

million dollar stars find us at the bar 
flossin in our cars cause you know who we are
million dollar stars find us at the bar 
flossin in our cars cause you know who we are

money cause you know we are, cause you know who we are
