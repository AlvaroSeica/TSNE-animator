[Intro: Talib]
Okay, Talib Kweli, P.O.C.
What is this?

[Chorus: Talib Kweli]
Check it out baby, check it out y'all {*4X*}
Uh (This the upper echelon shit)
What is this? (This the upper echelon shit)
What is this? (This the upper echelon shit)
Welcome to the "Prisoner of Conscious"

[Talib Kweli]
Brainiac dum-dum bust the scientifical
You feel it all, up in your soul, we gettin spiritual
You heard I'm comin back, you so scary it put the fear in you
I murder every track cause the rhyme is the light you stare into
R-r-real shit back, it's a miracle
Rap been laughable over the last year or two
Reflectin like a mirror do, who is the real livin proof?
I'm back, with that classical shit, I pack lyrical
Substance like bowls of kush, into a vaporizer
And I vaporize ya, my paper may surprise ya
No need to brag on my paper cause I'm a nature riser
I vibrate higher, the truth break liars
I-I-I-I-I toast to us and those like us
The lovers, the fighters, the writers, the exciters
Cut the grass, we can see the vipers
We cut the glass cause we the diamonds

[Chorus: Talib Kweli]
Check it out y'all
Check it out baby, check it out y'all {*3X*}
Uh (This the upper echelon shit)
What is this? (This the upper echelon shit)
What is this? (This the upper echelon shit)
Welcome to the

[Talib Kweli]
See I be listenin to real shit, real spit, my diehards feel it
Type of shit the fake niggaz find hard to deal with
I'm on a higher plane, I'm destroyin it while I'm buildin
My threat can't be contained so my name on Obama kill list
... Kweli the artist that you wanna be
Movin through the darkness, the light is what's in front of me
Front of me you posers exposin your insecurities
Supposedly your swagger replaces lack of maturity
The purity you need to get in the game is gone
Ain't no conspiracy, stop lookin for someone to blame it on
Gotta pay your debt, took your stale style and I made it fresh
Wait a sec, got your girl, wetter than tomato flesh
Waitin on me with baited breath

[Chorus: Talib Kweli]
Check it out y'all
Check it out baby, check it out y'all {*3X*}
Uh (This the upper echelon shit)
What is this? (This the upper echelon shit)
What is this? (This the upper echelon shit)
Welcome to the

[Talib Kweli]
Walkin through double fisted, I'm lifted off somethin vicious
Everything that's movin I'm gettin me a percentage
Vintage, nothin but the sky is my incentive
My girl is ride or die, I'm avoidin the evil temptress
Uhh, ain't no question who the best is
You don't like it stay the fuck out of my mentions
Pimpin, down to the socks, it's all business
The all-night workout like 24-hour fitness
... Huh, y'all niggaz is adorable
Incorrigible, the praise that you get is barely audible
People is ignorin you - why?
The last place in the world that you belong is a recordin booth
Order soup, niggaz is gassed up, petrolium
I laugh when these niggaz get swept up, custodians
of culture, +Back to the Future+ rap, DeLorean
I class up the joint, the spit is valedictorian

[Chorus: Talib Kweli]
(This the upper echelon shit)
What is this? (This the upper echelon shit)
What is this? (This the upper echelon shit)
Welcome to the "Prisoner of Conscious"
(This the upper echelon shit)
(This the upper echelon shit)
(This the upper echelon shit)
W-w-welcome to the "Prisoner of Conscious"
(This the upper echelon shit)
(This the upper echelon shit)
(This the upper echelon shit)
W-w-welcome to the "Prisoner of Conscious"
