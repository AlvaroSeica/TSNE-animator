Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
I was the kid that didn't get shit for Christmas
My moms didn't care about goodnight kisses
Fuck it
At least I got hugs from my sister
Never let me down
I got love for my sister
In the hood it got cold in the winter
She put me on a jacket
Everytime when I shivered
I didn't like superman
I idolized drug dealers
Jump me in the neighborhood
That's how I got a gun quicker
I was only twelve
Homies in &amp; out of jail
I needed money
So I went &amp; bought my first scale
That's when I learned how to bust raps
I told stories about my gang
And how I started selling dub sacks
Hood muthafuckas love that
When the enemies came through
Better believe I always bust back
I want the finer things in life
Jewels around my son's neck
A model for a wife

[Chorus]
There's a time &amp; a place
For every little thing
I'ma grind my way up
To get those big things
Yes I see it
My name is shining light
Let me shine for all the fallen
Wrap arms around them
Just let me get to where I'm goin'
Cause this is - this is my life
Cause its my life
My right - my mind

[Verse 2: Kiki Smooth]
Wu-tang hustle
Chasing that cream
As a young buck
On my bicycle moving thangs
Ditching school
Trying to get paid
Had a corner stand
And didn't sell lemonade
Step-pops in the kitchen
Bagging up them drugs
Me &amp; my little bro
Soaking game like a sponge
Eyes on the prize
Make my dream a reality
Love &amp; happiness
Puffing on some al green
Sitting on the curb
Thinking about my master plan
Gather up the soldiers
Invade the rap game
Voice of the people
The vato got heart
I spit that fire
Illuminate the dark
Serving in the hood
Fiends know my nickname
Mister go get it
I ain't tryin' to fucken wait
Here to be the greatest
Top of the mountain
My debut is coming
The days are being counted

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Trust nobody
Keep your trust me dog
You never should
Them boys will treat you like
When death row belonged to suge
Cause if the deal goes bad
Black hoodie on
Here we come to peel yo' cap
In l.a
We hit a spanish club called rodeo
I came to hear my homeboy weasel's song
From los canelos
Corona in my hand
Listening to his corridos
I wanna do what
How scrappy did up on cerritos

[Verse 4: Kiki Smooth]
Living that fast life
No time for pumping breaks
Heard it through the grape vine
Kiki bout to elevate
Kick in the door
Like biggie to the smalls
Smooth don't care
If he's big or small
Gangsta in the mirror
Man of the hour
Dope man flow
Got ya face looking sour
Mama always told me
There'd be days like this
I was born in the ghetto
Can't worse-er than this

[Chorus]</pre>
