[Intro]
Aaaiight...aaaiight...aaaiight...aaaiight!
OH NO NOT THEM HERE THEY COME!

[Fredro Starr]
Balheadz and gunz BLOAW!
Do you wanna run say: "Aaah!" (Aaah!)
Wich way did he go? You don't know
You move too slow, boy you BLOW
My style flows on you right here
Where my Queens niggaz? (RIGHT HERE!)
Is you out there? (YEAH!...YEAH!)

[Sonsee]
Just watch us walk this hit, and get ILL
We won't gall, til we hear fifty bill
So grab a hoe, get a grib, it's time to shake it up
Rappers and routines, that make bricks

[Sticky Fingaz]
And you couldn't make me forget about, where I came frome
And even if I left the... SLUM, I'll still be a hoodlum
Cause good things come to those WHO TAKE 'EM
And I'm fed up, if there was so much anxiety
I gotta screeaam! (Aaah!) To let it all
This frustration that's built up inside of me

[Chorus: repeat 4X]
Come on and scream (AAH!)
And shout (OOH!), just let it all out (YEAH!)

[Sonsee]
These M.C.'s shoulda rehearse
They keep comin' around like auto-reverse
But then I shift THE WORST!
We THE WORST, and then they heard
But first da cut... then I bust they verse to quench my thirst

[Sticky Fingaz]
I've had mad money, but I spend it, now I'm broke
So I'm searching for somebody to put in a chokehold
And I can't wait to wrap my bare hands around they neck
And SQUEEZE until I fuckin' strangle 'em to death

[Sonsee]

Yo, you smell that?

[Fredro Starr]
Yeah, that's me, I'm the shit
I'm in affect like Woodtex
A newer Tec from out da click
Because my rhyme again, pass me my Heineken
WHERE'S THE WEED I NEED? It is my vitamin, so light it Lincoln (HAH!)
Reach for the sky, you won't survive, you won't get by, you gotta die
This style is a gimmick and you know that you can't be, what we be
We AFFICIAL NASTY!

[Chorus]

[Fredro Starr]
When I was born, I never thought that I could be like that
Growin up in the back block, sellin crack rocks
Watch the BLACK cops, I PACK cock clocks and glock phat knots
Nickel and dimes, petty crimes, packin plenty nines
And odds to stay alive, survive and they gettin' mine
Faultless for ghetto minds, and FUCK DA ???
See you rather run the streets and fuck around with the crooks
THEY GOT bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and deffer and better
This my better bottom of brother, word to mother!

[Sonsee]
Mo' niggaz grab the mics, talkin' 'bout they gonna set it
When all the rounds you'll make is fake and synthesis
We just get it, wish your style is old and ?
So burn up mo' money, cuz you gets no credit
You want it? Here go
Nigga know that you own me, or me gon' be on da street dealo
Bangin' M.C.'s, SO KEEP IT LIVE! Up in here
I swear nothing left, we pose dead, your best record by--Most def, Most Def

[Sticky Fingaz]
Sticky Fingaz, I earn money for walkin' in chains
Where I grew up, in Brooklyn New York, moved to Queens, and my teams
My pants bustin out the seams, wit this gun in my jeans
Without it I wouldn't've lived this long
In my wildest dreams, and I'm a STAR!
All spotlights, police high beams!

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Afficial Nast keep it on, keep keep it on, and ya don't stop
All City keep it on, keep keep it on, and ya don't stop
Armee keep it on, keep keep it on, and ya don't stop
Onyx keep it on, keep keep it on, and ya don't stop</pre>
