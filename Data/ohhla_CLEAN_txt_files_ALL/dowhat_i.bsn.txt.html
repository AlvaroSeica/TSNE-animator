Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro]
Lil Bitch, Money... Money. I've been working too hard
Finally Famous in this

[Chorus]
Baby do what you got to do, do what you got to do
Do what you got to do, Baby do what you got to do
For the shit that you gotta have, shit that you gotta have
Do what you gotta do, for the shit that you gotta have
We out here, grinding, shining
If I ain't getting paper bitch I'm dying
If I ain't getting paper bitch I'm dying
Do what you got to do, what you got to do [x4]

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Pop, pop, pop, pop that, whoa
Do everything except stop that, Hold up
All of that ass I can't grab it
You might as well be a fat bitch
Boy I'm 'bout it, 'bout it, getting sloppy toppy
While I'm rolling kamikaze
Skeet, skeet, swear I made the pussy fire hydrant
She up and down the pole, like she, like she fire fighting
Bitch I'm finally famous, I do, I do what I wanna
The money, money, sex, money in the air, with an aroma
Swear I got her head banging, banging, might be in a coma
Walk up to the baddest bitch and tell her that I own her

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Tyga]
T killer, big game, gorilla
I'm the one, pull up, like Billups
Two hoes, screw them like a fucking Phillip
Asian bitches, Wu Tang give them rhythm
Oh really, milli vanili, fucking with me
Bet she lift that ass up high like she hit a wheelie
In the club, be in the back like
Niggas pretending to be me, and that shit don't offend me
I'm about my business and this bitch is temporary
I don't give them love, try February
Money committed, swear this shit be married
I get that cake, cake, cake, then I pop a cherry

[Chorus]</pre>
