[Intro]
Crazy, I plead insanity
Crazy for you, baby

[Frank Ocean]
Talk to me, and I better not hear a word
Mmm, do me baby, I better not feel it girl
Baby I, I still got one bullet left, in my niiiine
Fin' to do a love crime, love crime, fin' to do a lovecrime

[Chorus]
Murder, murder, murder she wrote
Love crimes, love crimes
Murder, murder, murder she wrote
Love crimes, love crimes

[Frank Ocean]
You write me love letters, with your father's pen, ohh ahh
If he knew the freaky freaky things, that you write with it
Is it really wrong, that I want, to be the baby daddy?
Is that a love crime, love crime? Tell me it's a love crime

[Chorus]

[Frank Ocean]
Oh yeah yeah

[Chorus] - 1/2

[Frank Ocean]
In the getaway car
You know I love it when the ride is smooth {*music slowing*}
If we ever get caught
It'll be a long vacation for two

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

[Outro - unknown speaker]
Right? Men'll just stick it in every place they can
But for women, women it's just about
Security and commitment and whatever the fuck!
But you're not the jealous type are you?
You've never been jealous about me have you?
And why haven't you ever been jealous about me?
You're very, sure of yourself aren't you?</pre>
