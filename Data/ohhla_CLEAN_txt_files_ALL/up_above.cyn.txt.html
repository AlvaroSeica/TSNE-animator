[Cise Star]
One more time I gotta see your face and I
Cry every time I think about the things that ya did
Held me down, always told me to face my fears
I held the tears back had to get a beer
Just to maintain from all the stress of pain
I held ya there but damn now ya gone from ya
I think about the things that I should've said
Before the fall, I scream and I curse at God
For takin you away so early in my life
Ya never had the chance to see me have a wife
Never be a grandmother and see my kids
Ya never see ya son mature and go on to live
I fight the tears to stay strong for the fam, but damn
I'm just a man with a broken plan, I am
I'm just a man with a broken plan, I am
I'm just a man
C'mon

(talking)
Sometimes I just zone out
Thinking about everything that you did for me
All the love that you had given me
But then I think about where you are right now
And it brings me peace
And it brings me joy
But sometimes I still feel a little bit empty

Sometimes when the stress in the day is thick
I have a wish to have that one last kiss
One more hug, rejoice and grandma love
Of God above, a lot I needed because
The stress and strain, the pain come down the rain
The sun, it came too late now it's not the same
My life has changed, my soul has an empty place
And only the sound of your voice can fill the space
I'll wrestle angels just to see ya face again
Because you were my life, my mother and friend
You reside in God's love now in heaven above
So don't you move ya son gonna see you soon
I run, past the hardships tears and pain
Growin up I said ya name you always came
Hold my hand, gotta move through the storm
Now I need to be strong cause you're with the Lord
From the beginning to end, 'til I finish the start
Hold close to my heart no matter how hard
Things get to be, it's you I see
Smilin, cryin, lookin down at me
Wit tears of joy, come hold your baby boy
Look at me now, it'll make momma proud
So she can see the things I aspire to be
She sowed the seed, and now her boys a tree
And uh, moves are strong and they go along
And, raise the star let ? of God
And, all the love that you givin me
Help, me become the man you see
So, hold me close and never let me go
Low behold the time you have to go
Spread your wings momma let you fly
Cuz God himself will be the one to dry ya eyes

I'll wrestle angels just to see ya face again
Because you were my life, my mother and friend
You reside in God's love now in heaven above
So don't you move ya son gonna see you soon
I run, past the hardships tears and pain
Growin up I said ya name you always came
Hold my hand, gotta move through the storm
Now I need to be strong cause you're with the Lord</pre>
