[Intro: Wordsworth]
How long you plan to run
When the road ends, you can't turn back and go the other way
That's not a solution, that's only refusin'
Now you trapped yourself in more sides in everyway

[Chorus: Wordsworth]
So where you gonna run now?
Nobody makes it alone so
Where you gonna run now?
No more places to hide so
Where you gonna run now?
No more places to stay so
Where you gonna run now?
Eventually you get caught

[Verse 1: Wordsworth]
Troublemaker in her teens, either love or hate her
Seeks attention make a scene wherever her mother takes her
Curses her out, attitude worse then her mouth
Used to work in the south, 'til her aunt there kicked her out
Raising hell, acts invincible, yell back and spit at you
Held back in middle school, expelled, splapped the principal
Wilding out, nothing to be wild about
When her mom keeps her up to date with every style that's out
Long Island house, got her own room
Behave and save, a crib and care, she'll have her own soon
But shes very unappreciative gives all the credit to her dad
But the secret is her mom made him keep the kid
Doesn't go to school, just another truant case
Trespassed at a high school and slashed a students face
Can't go home police waiting
Tries to run away from her problems but they keep chasing

[Chorus: Wordsworth]

[Verse 2: Wordsworth]
Pops up on her pops porch
"My little girl came to see me, man it's been a while" that's what her pops thought
Scot-free at her pop's crib
Thought her mom was being cruel
thought her father had no set of rules, but he got his
Chores, mop the floors, then scrub the walls
After 8: 00 no noise, phone calls, no boys
Mow the lawn, wash the car and dishes, clean the kitchen
Wake up, we excercise, your curfew's at 9: 00
Was gonna teach her how to drive, couldn't wait 'till her father arrvied
And mischeif only keeps her occupied
Takes the keys while he went golfing, drove but not often
The store wasn't that far she could've just walked it
Foot slips of the gas, but to avoid the crash
Hits a woman coming out of Pathmark carrying bags
Hit and ran, felt she was driving safe
A customer inside the gate of the parking lot got the license plate
Parks it back in the garage, paint scratched, try to match it on the car
With nail polish so the accident was solved
Cops drove up asking, "Sir, do you own a Maxima"
She was gone before they thought of asking her

[Chorus: Wordsworth]

[Breakdown]
Calls her aunt upstate with the estate and the house that's by the lake
She said "I don't want that drama down here"
Calls her ex boyfriend that moved in Portland, Oregon to get away
He said "I don't want that drama down here"
Calls her cousin in Miami but the family called there before she did
They said "We don't want that drama down here"
Last call to her uncle but he's unaware
He said "Why don't you call your mom and dad"
She's like "Yeah, great idea"

[Verse 3: Wordsworth]
Whole city looking for her
Things escalated since the slashing and the hit and run in Brooklyn where they saw her
Changed her hairstyle, now in Staten Isle
Because she knows her grandma would never give up her grandchild
Blind in one eye barely could see who it was
Family always say they'll visit but nobody does
Through the screen door recognized, boy she was surprised
Lonely, seen it in her eyes as she rushed her inside
"Does your mom know that your here" but really didn't care
So delighted to see her, catching up on things, trying to feed her
Ran out of sugar, "I'll go to the store for you"
Hands her the purse but not without going in it first
Opens the door, cops ambush from the trees
With rifles wedged in her temple yelling "Freeze!"</pre>
