You don't wanna see hell as Vica Versa
We gotta stop complainin and claimin that jesus cursed us
My nigga Troy gave revelations inscripted in braille
Im here to speak on the devine Revelations of Hell
Imagine being pulled away from life for forty nights
To witness fright beyond comprehension of human sight
Though we don't see it, but this evil is spiritually groomed
The demons enter from the tunnels of fear to consume
They say the stench is unbearable for us human people
Deadly fluids, the smell of sewage is the same as evil
And after all this homicide who can sleep a settled
Knowin the shape of hell is the same as the human vessel
Aint symbolic yet psychotic in the same token
The flesh was smokin from the exposure for simple notions
Witness the maggots crawling at you, feel 'em and you learn
Prophecy had it they would dwell and you would never burn
Now how can I reply to his face, knowin I used to buy hella flakes
Steady goin to buy hella weight, my demise was the pay
Now Im feeling the fires of blood spillers and liars, making the ?????
There be another dead soul, making it worser than lead holes
Never should've said no, to God and let go
Now Im living in a death hole, beggin and wishin it was death row
Never ending torture to torture, I used to have a porshe it was gorgeous
And now Im dead in hell, wish I see God and bless his self
But now the forces have ordered the courses of horror
Murder him over and over, they put me inside a coffin, steady stabbin me slower
The razors penetrated higher and lower, and nothing indicating this will be over
Better things, you know what forever means? Never ending "Hell"
Eternal tensions from this mission this is all I mention "Hell"
I know its farfetched, and most of you may not believe it
But I dare you get the book, unfold it, hold it up and read it</pre>
