[Atherton]
In the beginning, some say there was a big bang
Particles colliding aligning the universe to hang
ever so delicately everywhere around us
Pop, goes existence from the ground up
Sound of silence took on the tone of noise
On the Earth's surface where they birthed, girls and boys
Little pearls of joy, a bundle of lovely
Sometimes I cannot see the beauty right in front of me
I don't wanna be another apathetic asshole
Noose on neck, losing grip, Lucifer's lasso
Last hope coincides with my last laugh
Knowing that I'll get happy before my last lap

[CHORUS]
All I wanna do is live my life
Make music eat good find a wife
All I wanna do is sing along
to the soundtrack of the sweetest songs
All I wanna do is live my life
Make music eat good find a wife
All I wanna do is sing along
to each and every single Paul Simon song

[Atherton]
In the end; well, I really hope it's painless
Take off in the silent night to Saturn on a spaceship
I'll get there and look back from whence I came
to the eyes of my child that will bear my name
That will bear the weight of this lightness of being
Marching in the grand parade to fight for some meaning
I've spent my life dreaming, believing in fiction
Intrigued by the feelings in meaningless diction
Easily breathing through needlessness wisdom
Seemingly keeping me from being a victim
Creeping and weaving retrieving the listener
My life AKA running with scissors!!

[CHORUS]

[Atherton - repeat 4X]
All I wanna do is, live
That's it, simply exist

WOO! Yeah, living

[Outro]
Expect nothing, blame nobody, do something</pre>
