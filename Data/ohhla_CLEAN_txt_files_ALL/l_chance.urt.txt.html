[Verse 1: Ozi Batla] 
Somewhere in the desert is a telegraph pole 
Holding up a telephone line full of copper wires 
With your voice and mine and a profound silence 
Trying to build a word-bridge between our islands 
I'd like to hold you but like I told you it's hard 
To look beyond tomorrow with this wounded heart 
Like a lion tamer who got mauled by his favourite 
This memory's still painful, time won't erase it 
And you've been through the same shit, ain't this, strange how, life shifts 
When you least expect it, Cupid beckons 
And love can live or die in a second 
So I'll say it now or forever wonder if, if 
Would our grip have slipped or was this the real shit? 
I pour some more change into the payphone 
And If there's something that you gotta say, please say so 

[Chorus]
The last chance, this'll be the last time 
this'll ever feel like this so don't miss 
The last chance, this'll be the last time 
this'll ever feel like this so don't miss 

[Verse 2: Urthboy] 
I met her when I wasn't in a good state 
Sore sight couldn't sleep right toss and turning all night 
You see I've never been a ladies man so wasn't like 
I whispered softly in her ear "yo baby let me take your hand" 
I try to play it cool though inside I'm inanimate 
Frozen up impossible to play like a real candidate 
Yeah I'm an MC they all call me 'wordsmith' 
But somehow the context changed and all the words miss 
But who'se to say you're not my life's purpose, It's Urth 
at your service, for once there's no question I'm certain 
But little does it translate, until the dam breaks 
I've got no rabbit in my hat yeah I'm not Mandrake 
I haven't got a trick, and no pick-up line 
Give me a sign and I'll repay it in kind 
Multiply it a by a dozen and we can call it a day 
And if you were inside my arms then this is what I would say 

[Chorus]
The last chance, this will be the last time 
this will ever feel like this so don't miss 
The last chance, this will be the last time 
this will ever feel like this so don't miss 

[Verse 3: Urthboy] 
I would've told you I was inspired, in awe 
Enthralled captivated by the way you bring 
Your self to the task, food for the starved, love 
For the heart, talking deeply, still sharing laughs 
And if I'm half what you are well I'm content 
When I have a couple kids I hope to pass on your sense 
And damn, I've seen the way that life can slip through the fingers 
Death might interrupt but the love will still linger 
[Ozi Batla:] 
My friend said that losing love is like a death 
But then love lingers long after the final breath 
And these sentiments I'm thinking of in retrospect 
Got me really wishing that you hadn't left us yet 
And if I'd known of what you were gonna do what could I say? 
A magic phrase or two which would've made you stay? 
In the storm cloud of your life you were the silver lining 
And in each one of our hearts your star is still shining 

[Bridge: Urthboy]
Resolve it all before you sleep man 
This could be your last chance (this could be your last chance)
It's water underneath the bridge man 
This could be your last chance (this could be your last chance)
Because no one lives forever man 
This could be your last chance (this could be your last chance) 
It's either do it or regret it man
This could be your

[Chorus] {x2}
Last chance, this will be the last time 
this will ever feel like this so don't miss 
The last chance, this will be the last time 
this will ever feel like this so don't miss</pre>
