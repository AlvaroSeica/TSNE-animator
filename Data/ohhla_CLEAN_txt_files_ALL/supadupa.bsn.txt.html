[Intro]
Uh huh.

D-town what it is? (whaddup)

Can you say G.O.O.D. Music?
Can you say G.O.O.D. Music?
And we do's this.

Uhn. Get ready for the next dynasty nigga!
Finally Famous the album comin' soon nigga.
B-I-G, beetch!
Look.

[Verse 1]
I am a supa' - dupa - troopa'
Use to the bottom, scuba
So I'm on the grind, skateboard or scooter
'Til I am the king of my castle - Koopa
Dawg, I took a shot at the dark in the industry's sharks
That's surrounded by water - Cuba
I can make a Einstein's mind feel stupa'
And I can make an insecure bitch feel supa'
Realest nigga ever - Kunta - Kinte
Ultra - master - super - sensei, dawg
In the nineth inner we're just tryna' hit a homer
Marge - comprende' - hard - aldente
M.J. - Jordan or Jackson
Only difference is, I ain't fuckin' with these kids
Sean - Big, a problem too big
Trick - you nigga's ain't shit - pissed, tsk, tsk.

[Chorus: x2]
I does it, I - I does it (does it)
And I'm a make this look like nothin' (nothin')
Watch me make this look like nothin' (it's nothin')
I'm a make this look like nothin'

[Verse 2]
I am solo, dolo
When they see me on my high horse - polo
See what I'm wearin', I know those
Hoes do, want the same thing - homo - Elton - Jojo
Made for the block, O'neil Romo
You hated on the block - robo - popo
But more importan-t-ly,
The story of my life, is to get glory off the mic.'s - Quincy
Remember the FF doesn't stand for fendi
Finally Famous, you are an attendee
You are labelled small - indie - centi - or semi
And I'm expected to blow - Lindsay
And if she's on my pipe, I'm a make her go DOWN - draino
And tell the bitch to eat her heart out - Kano
Hannibal - cannibal - sean, the man up in the hood - mechanical
This is the manual

[Chorus: x2]
I does it, I - I does it (does it)
And I'm a make this look like nothin' (nothin')
Watch me make this look like nothin' (it's nothin')
I'm a make this look like nothin'

[Outro]
B. Right, you're a genuis - yeah</pre>
