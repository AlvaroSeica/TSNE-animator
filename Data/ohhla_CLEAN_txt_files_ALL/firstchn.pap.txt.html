[Intro]
Come on now you know I was comin!
Y'all just ain't know when!
That was a cheap shot, now I gotta get you

[Verse One]
Big Sean's album is trash, it sound wicked
In fights I be swingin like Will and Jada Pinkett
Papoose who? Boy I'll give you face shots
I'll leave your eye Puffy like the nigga who made Ma$e hot (DAMN!)
All of your dogs is stray dogs y'all get straight shots
Bastards I split acid they need Maalox 
Kanye wore a skirt what was he tryin to prove?
Y'all be followin them illuminati rules (True!)
Carry yourself like a man and you will fail
Play a bitch, you prevail 
The only time they want the black man to show his strength is during sports
Outside of that they all want us to be soft
So Big Sean speak like a woman when he talk (HA!!!!!)
When he havin a seat he keep his legs crossed
We can't blame him, it's really not his fault
This is the feminization that he was taught
You ain't a man take that m from your mannerism
You brain dead, I just gave you aneurysm (DAMN!) 
True and livin, God cypher divine use your wisdom
Whenever I'm recitin a rhyme the proof is given (Yeah!)
Usin Biggie name? Who gave you permission?
You look like Ralph Tresvant from New Edition (HA HA!!!!!)
Gifted, I shoot to give no curse
Everytime they play +Control+ they skip yo' verse (Yeah!)
Little bitch how much change you got in your purse? I'm 'bout to lift your skirt 
It's a difference between great music and G.O.O.D. Music y'all ain't good with me
How the fuck they put your album out before Pusha T?! (WHAT!!!)
I figured out why your so skinny then I got over it (YEAH!)
Pusha must be sellin the crackand you smokin it
Anorexic describe the way that you spit
On your next album cover it look like you takin a ahit
Behind the green curtain same color as Kelis dress
On Nas album cover you a complete mess
Is that a indirect or you just a copycat
'Cause he killed you on your own album, he bodied that (YEAH!!)
Got the audacity to say your better than Drake
And out rap Jay-Z what a level of hate
Those artist made you hot go ahead and give grace
Worst +Clique+ verse they should spit that in your face
Your biggest record was called A-S-S
Nicki Minaj made it hot, you less fresh (YEAH!)
I heard you 'Ye yes manwho get paid less checks
So when 'Ye ask a question you just say yes yes! (HA!!!)
You cocky for no reason like you makin mad noise (WHAT!)
You got your style from the original Bad Boy (YEAH!)
B.I.G. Why you said that shit
Always sayin boi!!! That's Craig Mack shit (YEAH!) 
Still in New York? You better head back bitch! (THUG A!!!!)
Red still ringin, let that red mac spit (ANTE UP!!!)
First chain, don't make me laugh lame
In Brooklyn, that would've been your last chain
Said you stay on your toes, damn that's for ballerinas and girls
You should stay grounded, keep your feet on the floor
Miley did your video without you even
I saw your interview couldn't give a good reason at all
Lost on your first single you was fiendin the draw
Attention to your project, she evened the score (True!)
She illuminated your album you was fiendin for more
Prostitutin for the press, you a media whore (DAMN!)
Mentally you a virus
Part of the reason we lost Hannah Montana now we stuck with Miley Cyrus (DAMN!)
Talkin 'bout your +Hall Of Fame+ but you and 'Ye is all the same
Share a verse wear a skirt place them on the wall of shame
When they name lyricist they don't never call his name
So in every interview you hear the fuck boy complain (Yeah!)
Never walked in the subway tracks in the pourin rain
With a can of spray paint just to tag up on the train
Never seen a movie Breakin, Beat Street, Krush Groove
Style Wars, Wild Style damn your a fuck dude (DAMN!)
Ain't hip hop in alot of ways
Never walked with a walkman your first headphones was Dr. Dre's 
Sean I get at you! Ready to attack you!
Last name Mackie Doo, you gonna call me Papoose
Right on my hand I got my whole city tattooed
Five boroughs of death don't make me back smack you (HAAAA!!!!!!!!)
King of my castle get out of here skedaddle
Eyes on the prize and my ears to the gravel
Niggas like to tattle , shotty double barrel
Brains on the windshield, Kaine cousin Harold (WHAT!!!)
I carry the torch like a motherfuckin statue
Shittin on these rappers I don't even need a bathroom
They probably never had you know the man who craft you
Big head scientist go by the name of Yakub
Oh I spit a mean sixteen, I can match you
Well I spit a M-16 who wanna battle?
Papoose who? World Health Organization
Papoose who? You a owl or you hatin
Who? You know who the God is stop frontin
Never say who, Who is a rock group from London

[Outro]
HA HAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</pre>
