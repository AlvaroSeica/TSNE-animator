Typed by: Cno Evil

[Intro: Makeba Mooncyle]
The song I'm about to do, you know there's alotta battles
We have battles with ourselves, we have battles with the police
We have battles with friends, we have battles with people that look like us
We have secret battles with people that we don't even know that's battling us
But you know, this song I wrote, cuz, you know, I wanted to battle the beat
So I started to fight the beat, so, if you can hit this High Plainz Drifter
We can get it, we can get it, we can get it on
I'm feeling this here, I'm coming like...
High Plainz Drifter part two, it's orange in the house
Ill town, straight from boogie Brook Brook Brooklyn
United Kingdom, Makeba Mooncycle
Bout to drop some wisdom on your head like this

[Makeba Mooncycle]
I myself am much wider, you can even say bigger
When I deliver, I see you shake and quiver
I'm lasting longer, cuz I'm too swift and much stronger
Don't turn your back, cuz you might be a goner
I'm snatching props, like a posse steals loot, as I shoot
Off my mouth, blam blam, feel my anger
My lyrics hit shots like a 45 banger
Your a dirty dude with your rude attitude
Watching my back, cuz fiends attract
Absorbing all my energy, you really not a friend of me
Facing my face, what a waste
Why you sweating me, like Flex, stop 'stressin' me'
Killing me softly in your sleep, laying next to me
I brung it to your lower, it's hurting like a soda
When it comes to slinging, you better go retire
Into your groove like a madman's desire
I'm having fits, in my heart, there's a twitch
Staying on point, so my ass won't get lit
We're going forth and back, back and forth like intercourse, he marked it
Cuz I was too fierce when we started it
It was like I was the target, so he flips
Aiming for my jugular, so I can run out of wind
Saved by the chorus, when Hev brung it in

[Chorus 2X: Makeba Mooncycle]
The High Plainz Drifter, no one does it swifter than me
Makeba Mooncycle, I be, sucker I'm a High Plainz Drifter

[Makeba Mooncycle]
Catch my breath so I can breathe
Have a couple these, to knock you off your peas
I got your keys held hostage, you can't face me
Like an ostrich, my arms are not too short
Practice from the Gods, peace to the Earths and the Gods
I fight back, with the track
Stop all you, from fronting like you hard
Too swift my shit, so I'm quick to react
Hit with the kicks and the hi-hats
Strapped to the bass, with sawed-offs for the cause
Me and my mic, four by four
Crushing your mental like a blow to the temple
A rat-a-tat-tat, here's some blows to your central
My authority is my credentials, I'm essential
You can't compete, so prepare for destruction and defeat
Population creeps, universally, quality, eternally
Born in hell, I'm causing problems, I got the vibe
That keeps my channel live, feel the passion
From the Population Click, female assassin, why you asking?
No time for talking, just keep your ass walking

[Chorus 2X]

[Makeba Mooncycle]
Nothing can be done, I got you on the run
You was sweating bullets, while I reflect the sun
At the tumble off my weave, as I sit and roll my trees
Turn my black hat to the back for my enemies, I gets busy
Like Redman and Uncle Quilly, you must be silly
Break that ass up, like an old ass Philly
After smoking bud, I gets wiser, forgot my six shooter
My horse and my lighter, mental fighter, red slicer
I knock your man off his horse last nighter
I can dry ya, out like oxy, remember
You can never, outfox me, you better off messing with the, 'nother posse

[Chorus 4X]

[Outro: Makeba Mooncycle]
Uh-huh, you can't mess with this, cuz I throw fists
You can't mess with this, I throw lyrical fists
You can't mess with this, I throw lyrical fists
Sucka, I'm a High Plainz Drifter
It was the kinky, the notty
My voice will come to your party
Shine light on everybody, what
United Kingdom, Makeba Mooncycle
Yeah, the C.O.I.N.S., Illiana aka Taisha
What up, what up, what up, Brooklyn Rose this
Brooklyn Rose this, rodey rodey row
Prodigal Sunn, Killah Priest, 60 Second, Hell's the Heaven Razah
Royal Fam, yeah, yeah, the Clan, 7th Ambassador</pre>
