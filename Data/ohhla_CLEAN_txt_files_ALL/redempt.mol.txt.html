Redemption. Redemption

[Verse One] [Capital D]
I used to say C'est la vie, que sera sera
And wish that I could be this super duper rap star
Drive around the planet from New York to London
Take it for granted that it could never get redundant
Now where the fun went?
That dumb ish is played out
To hell with stunts and blunts and tryin' to stay out
I fade out from that lifestyle to retirement
Cause we all called to a higher environment
Then the club scene
Drinkin' down gin and juice
With a fogged mind, you don't wonder what your son produce
Nine months later with a shorty though
And you still tryin' to cling to your 40, no
I want true mission and submission
And never say a word without the most high permission
Now listen
Ain't nothin' deep for us to understand
Put the nonsense down and be a man

[Chorus] [Capital D]
Redemption
Peep science and reflect
And seek the divine, refine and perfect
Time we receive we really don't earn
So each day I promise to Allah to stand firm
What will the day bring?
I don't know, can't front
But if I listen close God will tell me what He want
Now some say the message in their ear ain't clear
Maybe what He's tellin' you, you ain't tryin' to hear

[Verse Two] [Capital D]
I see the straight path before me, but walkin' it is difficult
The nature of life is just just and reciprocal
You reap what you sew my brother
"But the times are tough"
"Yo, I know my brother"
To guard against sin, you see I gotta close ranks
And still coexist with all who give thanks
Become an old man and find a straight path
We argue over names, some debate and math
But you see God is one
One Earth and one seed
One word
So brother you must read
The information that you need has been written
Any knowledge I speak, is definitely bitten
So I'm a proud biter and reciter of news
A writer who will try to reach higher haiku's
Just a plain one, tryin' to shed a little light
As long as we're alive we can make wrong's right

[Chorus]</pre>
