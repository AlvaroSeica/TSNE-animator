[Verse 1]
Thru the misty window
Smoke rises like the puff from indo
You think its cush but these tribulations I seen tho
Strung up and whipped flipped
Skin opens and blood drips
When you in ya ride in deep state of mind ya pump this
I see Local smack spots locals smack what
Rusty backdrops
I Like drums tighter than genesis tank tops
Soon as the needle drops I write these bars
Craniums get rocked
Cos you the slave steppin the czar
Write lines royal like a Shah
Kinda like Fidel wit the cigar
Maybe mans mite dig up these bars to learn about their past
I'm tryina seek out my essence
But outside its unpleasant
What do you see thru ya window glass
Do you see the gold and glitter or do see him
In the corner bones cold wit the shiver
Merciless times you'll get left behind and flushed wit the detergents
Urban lurkin murky talesforever waiting a day ta tip the scales
This sight is pale in comparisontryina slice my worldly desires like a
Saracen
Reflective mood thru the window bars inspirin
Reflective mood thru the window bars bars I'm writin em..
Aiyyo my window journeys this is my window journal
Aiyyo my window journeys this is my window journal
What do you see thru ya window pain?
I see the pain

[Verse 2]
Futuristic universal like its Arabic scripted
Early for the train in case I miss it
The rhyme sometime is hidden sometime explicit
But exquisite trapped by the system so I diss it
Im free in the heart to reach heights beyond the universe
Im only trapped in the system if I let em get me first
So try fill my mind and heart wit divine remembrance
These words I write are art folded in a ring and birds carry the scroll to
far distant provinces  from valleys to offices
reflect  the position of a young boy lookin out at his war torn waste land
cracked glass window rusty steel blade in hand
cos they came for his pops and he know not what awaits him and his mother
his mother says things will be better up in jannah
what else can she say
scopin an adversity
Thru winds that be murky see
They try exploit souls like world bank does African resources
Offering dollars for their gold slave trader forces
But gold is worth more then paper so I try and write wisdom so gold lifts up
off my paper
Tongues a weapon yo sharp wit the razor now I'm lookin out like those who
await a saviour
Aiyyo my window journeys this is my window journal
Aiyyo my window journeys this is my window journal</pre>
