Let's go, let's go {*2X*}
Uh-huh, uhh

Babeez in the buildin cat
That's right, he in the buildin

[Verse One]
Ooo I got a one didn't take long to spot 'em
In the clubs showing love in them candy apple bottoms like ooo
What flavor you tryin to pick?
It dont matter if you slim, shorty thick in the hips
I like 'em ooo, and you can tell when she walks
She got that good ooo girl, let me break you off
I got that ooo baby, you can tell by the wrist
You ain't never gonna ooo like this

[Chorus One]
You gonna be, mine tonight
I got that ooo and it's parked outside
Pourin some ooo in your cup, blowin that ooo in the air
Ooo let me take you there

[Chorus Two]
Cause I'a hit you like ooo
Like you got your first freak
Backseat of the Jeep on a late night creep, like ooo
First time in the club
When you gettin some love, shorty backin it up like ooo
It's like rollin one up
Real girls gettin down and you throwin it up
It's like, gettin your girl in the V.I.P.
My first time with a fake ID, let me hit you like ooo

[Trey Songz]
Ooo I gotta, sexy wanna holla
On the flo' gettin closer, like we supposed to
Ooo shorty by the end of the night
See if we ooo like we came to it's gon' be tight
She bout to ooo all over herself
I had to say "Ooo girl get control of yourself"
She felt that ooo, when we bump and grind
See everything bout ooo is so fine cause

[Chorus One] + [Chorus Two]

[Trey Songz]
Now tell me how many thugs in the club got that ooo right there
Cause I'm looking at a ooo with a ooo and she right here

[Chorus One] + [Chorus Two] 2X
