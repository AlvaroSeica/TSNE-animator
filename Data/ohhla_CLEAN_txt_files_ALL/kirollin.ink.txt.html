Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
I said go on put your lighters up (what you smoking)
You can smell it over there, back (aint even open)
With your girlfriend getting high
And we smoking, making movies with the cameras on
Just keep it rolling baby
Just keep it rolling (been tryna smoke another one)
Just keep it rolling baby [x2]
You aint gotta turn the cameras off, just keep it rolling

[Verse 1]
They would think that it was Christmas (how I got her open)
You can see it in her poker face
(I got her falling)
Baby girl if you getting high
(I got the potion)
Now them hoes aint choosing, nigga
Im already chosen
I aint blind I can see you hate
(I keep it rolling)
They just mad cause they not here, and im the opposite of cold
And Im getting fast money, yeah the opposite of cold
And they might stay well try get another bottle from that hostess
with a pocket full of trojans
(You can call me Roman)
Kid Ink the entertainer they be wishing and they hoping that
Ima take her home cause this the after party
Get turnt up we already got started

[Chorus]
I said go on put your lighters up (what you smoking)
You can smell it over there, back (aint even open)
With your girlfriend getting high
And we smoking, making movies with the cameras on
Just keep it rolling baby
Just keep it rolling (been tryna smoke another one)
Just keep it rolling babe [x2]
You aint gotta turn the cameras off, just keep it rolling

[Verse 2]
I aint ever gone stop no, (no)
I keep it going
Walking like a giant, fi-fye-foing
Tatts everywhere, scarface Lil Tony
They don't ever tell me no
They say yes like Lil Corey
And im smoking on some good (good)
You for it, put my CD in
She gone thank you for it
Kid Ink baby, say hi to the bad guy
Only one year and I aint nothing like the last guy
In the club, mmm. its alright
We can leave we aint gotta stay all night
Know, its OG waiting back home
Lil kid you can feel it in your back bone

[Chorus]
I said go on put your lighters up (what you smoking)
You can smell it over there, back (aint even open)
With your girlfriend getting high
And we smoking, making movies with the cameras on
Just keep it rolling baby
Just keep it rolling (been tryna smoke another one)
Just keep it rolling babe [x2]
You aint gotta turn the cameras off, just keep it rolling

I dont know about you, but Im living in the moment
You can hate if you want but Ima keep it rolling
Gotta super bad bitch feelin like Seth Rogen
Making movies all night
Just keep it rolling babe

[*spoken*] this the part when you get your lighters out,put them in the air just keep it rolling baby
