(sung by Monoxide) 
People are strange 
When you're a stranger 
Faces look ugly 
When you're alone 
Women seem twisted 
When you're unwanted 
The streets around you are whole when you're down 

When you're strange 
Faces come out of the rain 
When you're strange 
No one remembers you're name 
When you're strange 
When you're strange 

(sung by Jamie Madrox) 
People are strange 
When you're a stranger 
Faces look ugly 
When you're alone 
Women seem twisted 
When you're unwanted 
The streets around you are whole when you're down 

When you're strange 
Faces come out of the rain 
When you're strange 
No one remembers you're name 
When you're strange 
When you're strange

No one remembers you're name 
When you're strange 
When you're strange
