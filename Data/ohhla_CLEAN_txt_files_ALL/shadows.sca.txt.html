[Hook 1 - Scarub]
Some of these girls they think they own ya
Using they sassy ways ta put it on ya
Then when you don't call them back soon enough yeah they phone ya
Cursing you out throwing shit fits tryin ta stone ya
Hold on I remember being committed bending on my knees
Asking for your company till death do us part
If you like the way we vibing baby you can be down
But tying me around your pinky lady don't even start

[Hook 2 - Amazon]
Ok sometimes it seems you see my presence in your dreams
But lately you've been acting so uncertain and displeased
Constantly expecting me to honor and obey this
lifetime of dealing with the women that you play, stop it
I'll make it simple don't ask me for my name
I'll keep my cleavage covered you keep your sorry game
Fame has made you wicked and you'll always be searching for humanity
i hope that while you live you rest in peace.

[Hook 2 - Scarub]
I like those freestyles, I hold on to what I have
Like a mean child, Stingey because thats all I have
In the meanwhile, you hardly know half of my story
But surely your eyes despise and judge me as one of those guys
being found

[Hook 2 - Amazon]
Acting like a spoiled adolescent
While you disrespect every last lady in your presence
i've got confidence I leave you in the past tense
Cause my passion no longer exists, you wont receive my kiss.

[Hook 3 - Scarub, Amazon]
[Sca] A mark in the dark
[Ama] A waste of a heart
[Sca] A piece of a part
[Ama] A blend in the crowd
[Both] A shadow (*repeat 9X*)

[Verse 1 - Scarub]
It was never yours to begin with
Face it, it happens to the best of us
A reality check,huh, makes a mess of us
Then left looking like the rest of us do now
I mean those who steal scour like a child acting all juvenile in denial
? I wish that itch turns into a burn when you can't scratch what you want
Don't it
Now we can pretend it never happened but it will always be different won't it
Just don't let it happen again and were cool, Don't trip
Scarub's literary were never in the grips of yours to begin with
Youse were born and were in with it
That's only till the end of it
Everyone has their own philosophy on how love ought to be
and some are better then others
While others see others as monstrosities
Your dream is my nightmare
How did you figure you'd be the boss of me
Trying to make me move at the velocity that you choose
Order me to move expeditionary an hour freeze, froze
Now i've never been the one to be like these hoes
But these hoes expecting to brown nose
Not all women just those who suppose that the world revolves around them
And until they wake up I will forever clown them
If you can't compromise I can't corroborate
If you spit lies I won't walk away
Never was one to operate like that
i'm as stubborn as you are bitchey
You can't get through my abuse me up until i'm all gone
Then ditch me and glide to the next
But I see what you mistook me for
See how you figured you could break me into your advantage
And order me to the door until it's outworn then get torn to shreds
Keep your seductive jargon, I can't hear you, how dare you
Chuckling to myself will I wait by through my rearview
Your such a shadow girl
such a shadow girl (*repeat 4X*)

[Verse 2 - Amazon]
He said he'd like to take me dancing cause my figure was impressive
Said he'd seen me in his fantasies constantly
Won't you write your number on this napkin
I'll pick you up at seven
His girlfriend was in frisco for the weekend (What?)
While he was speaking I kept thinking all prejudges story cause you bore me
Keisha, Pam and Cory told me bout your fame and glory
Girls before me babies mamas skimpy loose pajamas in your dirty hamper
Open condoms scattered on your dresser
Who you trying to fool
I can smell the silencing from what your calling poetry
Your eyes are manly focused on anatomy
instead of me experiencing several different immature Peter pan
Never growing up you'll be a free man
Hours pass my prince is yet to reach the surface
And what would be the purpose
My tears are not commercial in this cycle of relationships is constantly a battle
I look beyond the shadows for a shadow

[Repeat hook 1]
