Song:   We Are the World
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I had to do this before I die
It's your boy Lil B
Stay positive stay positive
I love you...

My people we can change the world
It takes a brave one to stand up
Live positive, turn that frown upside down
Love means life, it's our town

My people we can change the world
It takes a brave one to stand up
Live positive, turn that frown upside down
Love means life, it's our town

I did this song because it's real
And I love y'all
We all gotta get together because it's our family
It's all of us man, the whole world (you feel me)
The whole world
I'm alive and I love it, and I'm happy you're alive
May god bless your soul
Yeah, It's time to spend time and it's time to see the earth
Man, it's time for rebirth

Yeah, I'd love to see you smile in the path of yesterday so it's easy for today
And even though it seems hard,
we're one big family and it's all our jobs
To help one another, to love one another
Man, god bless our mothers, and God bless our fathers
And even though it seems crazy
And you're thinking you're lazy
Just know I'm here and we're living positive

My people we can change the world
It takes a brave one to stand up
Live positive, turn that frown upside down
Love means life, it's our town

My people we can change the world
It takes a brave one to stand up
Live positive, turn that frown upside down
Love means life, it's our town

Man, I just think the strangest things,
I love it when I daydream
And you're not weird, you're unique
And every day I wanna speak
And tell you how nice you are
And tell you how cool you are
And you're just a shining star
And it's positive in my heart
I'm gonna help all my friends
And be there until the end
Whatever you need from me, I'll be here
So if I don't live to see tomorrow, just know you're a shining star
And every day I live for you, who would've knew
I just cried, you feel me

My people we can change the world
It takes a brave one to stand up
Live positive, turn that frown upside down
Love means life, it's our town

My people we can change the world
It takes a brave one to stand up
Live positive, turn that frown upside down
Love means life, man, it's our town</pre>
