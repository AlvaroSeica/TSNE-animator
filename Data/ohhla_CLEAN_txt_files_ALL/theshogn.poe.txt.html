Song:   Death to the Shogun
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

When I was little... my father was famous
He was the greatest sam-urai in the empire
and he was the Shogun's decapitator
He cut off the heads of a hundred and thirty-one lords, and the Shogun...

It was a bad time for the empire
The Shogun just stayed inside his castle - and he was infected by DEVILS
His body was rotting with evil
The Shogun said the people were not loyal

He said he had a lot of enemies
but he killed more people than that
It was a bad time, everybody was living in fear

But still we were happy
My father would come home to mother
And when he'd see her, he would forget about the killings
He wasn't scared of the Shogun, but the Shogun was scared of him
Maybe that was the problem</pre>
