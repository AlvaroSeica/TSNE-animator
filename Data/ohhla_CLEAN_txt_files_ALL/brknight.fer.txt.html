{Verse 1 0:20}
It's a cold world aint it, word to Jermaine
Great minds think the same
See I could roc the nation but, the dollars I'm accumulating
Only amounts to a few things that I can partake in
Like recording tracks, I'm sacrificing the food that I'm eating too a few snacks
While these other rappers wack, getting put on spending money on shit I can barely afford
I just wanna four door I can push too the store
But, these jobs not hiring need I say more
And this music inside of me just needs to explore
They say if opportunity doesn't knock, you build a door
Well, I built a whole house had to start from the floor
Invitations to the people who were with me before
I still can't see where I'm headed at all
Just a little bit of hope and believing above {above}...

{Hook 1:01} Repeat 2X
Cold life, No lights
I gotta dream, I gotta dream and it's so bright
If only, I could change the world
I could change the world but, it's just another broke nightÂ…

{Verse 2 1:21}
Welcome to the dark side of the moon
I'm on the run in search of places to jump {jump}
Speak to me anyway that you want
Time and time again I'ma tell you that this is fun
No money's coming in but, I know that it's gonna come
So I breathe, focus on what I need
Any colour you like except for the color green yup that's how it seems
Typical sillyness, I'm blocked out, blocked out what is this eclipse
The industry doesn't see me, they don't give a shit
Well, here I am kid malik ferraud and I rep maryland with a capital M bitch
I'm to hungry so I'm pickin at the locks
I use to be outside now I'm stealing to the top
Coming in fast yeah I'm claiming my spot
I tell em make room or get dropped {dropped}

{Hook 2:01} Repeat 2X
Cold life, No lights
I gotta dream, I gotta dream and it's so bright
If only, I could change the world
I could change the world but, it's just another broke night...</pre>
