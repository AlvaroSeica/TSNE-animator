[Buckshot]
Yeah - this is also
A message for all y'all heads out there
Who just heard, whatever you hear
This is the Boot Camp Clik, and we everywhere
Right now y'all 'bout to get into the real mindstate
of where this is all goin, the Temple of Hip Hop y'all
Keep your mind thoroughly placed where it's at
So you can know where it's goin
Understand?</pre>
