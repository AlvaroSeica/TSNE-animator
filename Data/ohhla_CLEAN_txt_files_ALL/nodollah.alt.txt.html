[Sample]
"The question still remains, where is the money"

[A.L.T.]
Yo man
Check this out

(Verse 1)
I got pull like a trailer
I cuss like a sailor
I shop at the swap meet, never had a tailor
I don't really care
I'm broke as a joke
Yeah, I had a single, but the record didn't smoke
I drive a Toyota, it's older than Yoda
Mona wanna loan her, but I already told her
That I don't have a penny
I'm short of a nickle
Tried to buy a burger, but I only got a pickle
A brand new Pinto, only in dreams
I'm talkin' secondhand jeans and refried beans
But A.L.T. treats ya
Good money meets ya
I'll offer you a soda and a piece of frozen pizza
Girls wanna mingle
My pockets only jingle
Damn, I'm getting hungrier, so please buy the single
Don't ask for a nickle
And please take a hint
If you ain't got dollars
Then you ain't got sense

Hook: Sample
{*scratching*}
"Dollars and cents"
"Dollars and cents"
"Trying to get her hands on some doll-"
"Dollars and cents" --&gt; Ice Cube

(Verse 2)
Rhymin' up a funky rhyme and lyrics, yep, I got 'em
Plus I got sober, there's a hole in the bottom
Peeped out, and scoped out, the hons when I was little
Couldn't afford a guitar
I had to learn to fiddle
That was never cool, and all the honeys never liked it
They were always on the A.L.-I-will-take-a-hike tip
I love Italian food
The noodles
Alfredo
My spaghetti's good, but yo, it doesn't have tomato
Tomato
Tamoto
I'm a desperado
Mexicans win, but this one can't afford the lotto
A knock at my door
I open, it slowly
Jevohas, leave me alone, because my socks are really holy
If I get a crowd, yo, I try my best to rock 'em
I got some clever beats, and when I get a chance, I knock 'em
Don't ask for a penny
And please take a hint
If you ain't got dollars
Then you ain't got sense

Repeat Hook

(Verse 3)
I got some Chuck Taylors, so my shoes, they always stand out
I doesn't have a penny, but I won't accept a handout
Never had a radio, I had to stick to hummin'
Mom
Mom
The ice cream man is comin'
Her time is always out, so she always thought I planned it
Other kids got some, but I was empty-handed
I live with my parents
My room is always dirty
Mom said I can stay
But only til I'm thirty
I never had no money, but it really doesn't matter
If my record sales
Then I'll be livin' phatter
There a lot of people, so be cool and take a hint
If you ain't got dollars
Then you ain't got sense (Sense...)</pre>
