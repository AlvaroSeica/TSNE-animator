[Hell Rell]
Surgeon General, what's hood, what's good nigga
Hell Rell, DipSet nigga (all day, everyday)
BX is the borough (yes sir)
Sha you lay the groundwork down man (groundwork!)
This is groundwork right here man
This is nothin (this is nothin)
Rollin up my sleeves on a nigga (let's do it) uh-huh, yeah

All my G's in N.Y. carry big fo'-fives
Chicago, L.A. prefer them AK's
All Philly niggaz, is Mac milli' niggaz
Every thug in St. Louis bought an uzi
Now who's the real dookie? Meanin who's really the shit?
Frank White, rest in peace, you was really the shit (R.I.P.)
And them hoes went crazy when I hopped out the Beemer
Had on so much ice looked like I hopped out the freezer (brrr)
Eagle got rainbow rocks (rocks) and them whips is fruity
Banana Benzes, mango drops (look at 'em)
Listen playbot we ain't gon' stop (nah)
Yeah your gun bust but what makes you think mine ain't gon' pop? (pop)
Gettin fresh out homey, just came from the mountains (mountains)
Since I been home a lot of niggaz been frownin (I see y'all)
Runnin 'round poutin, like this SK won't pop
Leave you stretched out right in front of they house
And these, lil' niggaz runnin 'round with lil' heaters
'Bout to send bullet at 'em size of my middle finger (uh-huh)
And, youse a little middleman in the middle of a little war
Yeah I'm on my Big Pun shit, I run shit (woo!)
I got enough guns and clips to take on a SWAT team (c'mon)
Red dots, all of 'em got beams (yeah)
And moms talkin 'bout I need Jesus in my life (what?)
Look he hangin from my neck, I got Jesus in my life nigga</pre>
