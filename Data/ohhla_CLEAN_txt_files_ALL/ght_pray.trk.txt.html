Typed by: pneumatic

[Intro: Truck, Apocalipps]
Let's pray, (Let's pray) Yeah yeah
Come on, Don't be afraid, (Don't be afraid)
Man I aint afraid man, Get on your knees
I'm ready to speak to the lord too, Like this
Let's do it

[Chorus 2X: Apocalipps (Truck)]
Now I lay me down to sleep, I
Pray the lord my soul to keep, If
I should die before I wake
I hope you all respect this music I make (Respect this music I make)

[Apocalipps]
I was born a bastard, Pops shot me out a cold nut
Freezin in the womb, Before you judge me hold up
I felt rejection, Inside the womb it hurts, (So what)
So I cam out the pussy middle finger first, (Fuck yall man)
Fuck the world, Six pounds two ounces, (Uhh huh)
Blood everywhere, My moms aint stay for the stitches, She bouncin, (I'm out)
All in the game, Left me with the littlest frame
They through me in a crib, But it looked more like a cage
And I guess I was made for the pens, (What)
18 years later, What a coincidence, The pens I'm in
Stressed out, Young black male, Don't get no mail
Intelligence, Self educated, But destined to fail
Picture a funeral, Every bodies dressed in black, (Yo whoÂ’s' that)
But who's the brother shackled up in state greens
With a tear in his eye, The smell of death make his face bleed
With two cops that look like Murdock for A-Team
What a turn around, Apocalipps now
Destined to take the game, They gone stop me how
Truck and Lips, Two cousins like two brothers, (uh huh)
Our struggles the same, So they separate us from others
Let's go

[Chorus]

[Truck]
As I kneel in front of my bed with my palms together
I ask the lord, Can you help me get my life together, (For what)
Since day one it's been fucked up, (Uh huh)
I remember bein homeless, Nothin to eat, No luck
When the food came up missin, They knew it was us, (Where's the food at)
My thoughts is the autobiography of Truck
I was young, Dumb, Ignorant, (What else)
That kid right there don't got no sense
Problem child, Growin up in the ghetto was wild, (Uh huh)
Forced me to do things I regret that's foul, (Like what)
I can't change my past, So I look for the future, (Uh huh)
Hungry Man Apparel, Nigga lace your boots up, (That shit is hot)
One Day at a time, Yeah step by step
Staten Island the fifth borough, For life I rep

[Chorus]</pre>
