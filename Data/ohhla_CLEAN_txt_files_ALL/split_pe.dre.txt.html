[Intro: Dr. Dre Talking]
yeah, I'm just sittin' in the lab, I'm...
my name is Dr. Dre, and
I want all you mothafuckers out there to know
that I have a split personality   (*Mr. Ski chuckles*)
and sometimes I just, exit through these things, you know
ha ha, you know, hell yeah..

[Break: E-A-Ski]
Mr. Ski nigga
I'm takin' over shit Dre
(*E-A-Ski chuckles and laughs*)

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
diagnosis, roaming with more personality to slaughter
with modern tech, jugglin' hard in a Leg' versus manslaughter
I took a swig of the potion and it sent me coastin'
with visions of my ulti-Eagle hittin' three wheel motion
"Is it Dre, is it Dre"
No that Ski in a purple 6-tray G.T.A.
killin' any mothafucker walkin'
and all these niggaz in these magazines that keep on talkin'
don't get twisted, I been there, I done that
but Ski's out control and maniac
he just show me that he got my back "I just show him I got your back"
see, in a lot of there, I'm straight
I'm Dr. Dre, but after stroke of mid night
and Mr. Ski A.K.A. Dooms Day
concocted the shit up in my lab
with Mr. Ski up in my head, bringin' on the Aftermath
you can see the stars runnin' from the sky
tryin' to get away from Dr. Dre and Mr. S-K-I

[Chorus: 2X]
[Mr. Ski ] the Doctor should've told you, Mr. Ski is fatal to your health
[Dr.Dre] I'm livin' on another level that y'all ain't been yet
[Mr. Ski ] the Doctor should've told you, Mr. Ski is fatal to your health
[Dr.Dre] yo, the life style that I'm livin' is just too complex

[Verse 2: Mr. Ski]
it's Mr. Ski and Dr. Dre, can't stop this maniacal individual
to start showin' level, with 7.0 on your digital
I'm tryin' to take over shit like Buddy-love
but this professor ain't nutty and he can't do it, any herpe dove
I was the madness that brought on Dre Day
such this time Dr. Dre, he's the one is gonna pay
I dropped this bud, strain in his brain and shed it off
and have them slangin' guns to them females wouldn't set it off
I do dirt, and tied up his body and break free
witnesses saw Dr. Dre but it was really Mr. Ski
you might think it's insane, but it's a clever scheme
Dre don't know shit, he wake up in the morning thinkin' it was a dream
put his ass to sleep and soak his game up
steady mobbin', hopin' to get this mothafucker brained up
I can't stop till I succeed, then I can break free
no longer Dr. Dre, nigga it's Mr. Ski

[Chorus: 2X]
[Mr. Ski ] the Doctor should've told you, Mr. Ski is fatal to your health
[Dr.Dre] I'm livin' on another level that y'all ain't been yet
[Mr. Ski ] the Doctor should've told you, Mr. Ski is fatal to your health
[Dr.Dre] yo, the life style that I'm livin' is just too complex

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre]
I start shakin'
test tools and bottles start breakin' (*glass crush*)
my Ulti-Eagle starts overtakin'
instantly spinnin' around like the mass
tossin' that shit up off like a twister
no longer, the docter or Mister "Ski"
I can't hold it back
I'm trapped behind the walls of my brains, tryin' to count a rack
"even though tryin' to fight"
my vocal tone ignited into a loud scream "how high"
it's time to get the fuck up off, yeah

[Verse 4: Mr. Ski]
I'm on the loose like 2Pac I'm juiced
God bless the dead
but I'm already dead from trauma to the head
I'ma verbal Manslaughter on the Mic
bumpin' in your trunk, shatterin' your glass from the street life
nobody wants to play with me so I'm drillin' them
I'll be back like Swords nigga, so I can finish killin' them
if you want music to drive-By
torment minds like yours and Dr. Dre
but all I think about is S-K-I

[Chorus: 2X]
[Mr. Ski ] the Doctor should've told you, Mr. Ski is fatal to your health
[Dr. Dre] I'm livin' on another level that y'all ain't been yet
[Mr. Ski ] the Doctor should've told you, Mr. Ski is fatal to your health
[Dr. Dre] yo, the life style that I'm livin' is just too complex

[Outro: Mr. Ski]
