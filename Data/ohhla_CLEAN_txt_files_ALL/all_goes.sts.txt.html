[Leo the Lion]
Can you blatantly say looking straight in her face
that you ain't telling tales to her?

[Chorus]
If you never tell a lie to her
You don't have to remember anything
But it all goes out the window
When I try to do it myself

Oi, oi
Can you blatantly say looking straight in her face
that you ain't telling tales to her?
That you never get stressed
when she questions events she'd be best to forget?
Can you actually brag when the alarm glances when your prangin' or chatting?
That if you had the chance to go back
to her pad for a passionate act you wouldn't have it?
Oi, but why's that then?
(That's cause the reason you've been faithful is)
You've been so good
(Cause you've never seen temptation
Deep down you heed the man's burden)
We all have a man's burden in our heads
(You'll always be a bad person)

It's getting you down
You were letting her down
You were tempted and you bowed
You showed her up
You need to be owning up
You need to show her you love her for once
It was an extreme circumstance
It was she that advanced
She defeated you gradually
So you must stand
Be honest
You must get on this
Mend the wrong shit

[Chorus]

Oi, oi
So why you wanna phone up?
Why you wanna own up?
You were selfish and so dumb
To ease it off your chest
To be relieved of the mess
That's being proper selfish, oi
I've been in some broken moments
I know what goes on the road
But there's a road you chose
However coats should be brang
You know you chose the strain
She knows your game, but
Oi

(But it makes you see things clearer)
It was weird though, man
(But you didn't wanna be with her)
Seriously, back home ..
(If your girl was to even hear
If would spare her weak heart
She need not fear)

The chance to see the fit thing naked will spell and mesmorize you
You'll disregard the ways the lady in your life inspires you
Which is why the day she tires of you
You'll be crying and howling
And if you have the chance to go back to her pad
For a passionate act
You won't allow it
But if you're plans on the chance to go back is not even had
Then the passionate acts won't happen
Cause you plan not to have the chance
Rewind that back if that sounded fast, oi
You can't think straightly
You gotta avoid the situation
Forget what she's doing
You may be mugged if you trust too much
But it will fuck you up more worrying about
Trust

[Chorus] - 2X

(You may be mugged if you trust too much
But it will more fuck you up
It will more fuck you up
Worrying about trust)</pre>
