Song:   Around 'N Round
Typed by: Cno Evil

[Chorus: Blue Raspberry]
Around and round we go...
Who really think you, can just take us no more
We keep going back and forth, forth and back
When you leave, boy, don't come back
What you do to me, will always come back to you

[Blue Raspberry]
You say there's man or woman that I can know
But I break pause and I let it go
Made me feel like I was gonna be his queen
Like a fairy tale, all I want is fantasy
But then I had to snap into reality
And realize he wasn't only loving me
Can't forgive him, cuz my love was too deep to see
That your ass was just not fucking me

[Chorus]</pre>
