[Intro: Li-Mouse (Knickolist Knowledge)]
Li-Mouse (This is a Knickolist Knowledge production)
Knick, you did it again (featuring The Rodentz)
Shit is crazy (get ready for it) fuck that (yeah)
Li-Mouse (aiyo, aiyo, aiyo)

[Chorus: Knickolist Knowledge]
My peoples gotta eat, my family's gotta live
So rock with The Rodentz, and roll with the kid
My family's gotta eat, my peoples gotta live
So rock with The Rodentz, and roll with the kid

[Cno Evil]
Here comes the flow, microphone Van Gogh
The blood is Type O, with the shots I free throw
Vintage Bordeaux, I bestowed years ago
Riding on my horse and carriage, stomping through the snow
It's the third Cno, Evil Part 3
Mr. Miyagi, this kid kicks karate
Try and stop me, and you'll get disembodied
Bend your arms and legs like your bitch doing Pilate's
Hardly, can you phase the kid
You slid in like a squid, but nope, I forbid
The home of the amazing arts like Madrid
My mic blade's expanding hearts so I got rid of
You and your crew who tried in my shoe
But got tossed off the ship like them stowaways do
That's nonsense, I control your thoughts like your conscience
Crowd over your shit, like them pits that be moshing
These beats is dirty, so my lyrics do the washing
Nobody to my soul like your name was Roxas
Surpass ya'll with speed, of a runaway train
My pinkie got more thought, than most MC's brains
Bitches try to reach for my joystick, but I ain't playing
I'm up in the mountains just to see what they 'Sayan'
Low IQ's can't compute, they just stay mute
Space paranoid, electron with lasers that shoot
Another session, mixing songs together with compression
Not to mention, that our lyrics can teach a lesson
With simple comprehension, that stretch your section
Now the sword chops up your whole body, attention
Copy, paste, erase, enter the next space
Re-arrange the verbs, so the words get put in place
The shit looks good, and it's got a good taste
I just need a dope hook that puts a smile on my face

[Chorus]

[Li-Mouse]
Aiyo, straight out of White Plains, yup, it's us
Rodentz focus energy, then we must crush
Fake ass MC's that think they can compete
But ya'll are soft like freshly poured concrete
Back to Relax; 'we can never swallow defeat'
I excrete, discreet shit that stays elite
Like you never even fucking existed
Cno and Mouse, never be resisted
I'm on this mic, like, white on rice
Up in your head, like you got a case of lice
Spears nimble, like blades of grass
Keep moving through like tolls and EZ Pass
Ya'll don't want us to really start to think again
It's mad scary, made the ink run out of the pen
Shit is crazy, you can never say shit about me
Making the pessimistic cats agree
Give me my crown, fuck it, I take the throne
Headphones, speakers, and your ring tones
Wearing out your components until they blown
Pioneers within, will try to figure out Li
There only solution will be to put a muzzle on me
Sony will explode trying to contain our sound
JL still try to figure out how the bass shakes the ground
Only one left is defined discos exposed
We annihilate, where they go, who knows

[Chorus 3X]

[Outro: Knickolist Knowledge]
It's The Rodentz, Knickolist Knowledge
Cno Evil, little Mouse, get ready</pre>
