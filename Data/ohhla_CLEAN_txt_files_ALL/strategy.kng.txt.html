(Useful strategy)		--&gt; MC Lyte

[ VERSE 1: Sugar Ray ]
Standin over the mic, gettin deeper in thought
Brain cells amplifyin at a 1000 volts
Rhymes combined and musically designed
While my DJ rock the funky beats all the time
I'm usin strategy, leavin suckers in the dust
You know it's us, the Kings cold crush
Makin a move to a swing-swing groove
I bet you nod your head, cause I got nothin to lose
And never singin the blues and never steppin off track
Makin funky records from back to back to back
Well, that's my strategy and part of the gameplan
While you're hearin this, I'm workin on the next jam
I devastate the whole industry
I rock the funky beats and rhymes with telepathy
Well, it's confusin but amusin, some amaze me in rap
Brothers makin hit records that ain't all that
But the subject to the matter don't apply to me
Because my name is Sugar Ray, and the rhymes are so funky
You wanna battle? Call my company
You catch a beatdown, I'm usin strategy
Kick it

[ VERSE 2: Mike Master ]
I treat suckers like a boardgame, and relate em to chess
I check-mate em and I raid em cause the punk ain't fresh
He can't make a move, he can't make you jump
I'm Mike Master, ready to hump and pump
I mean a winner with a creative mind
I got a high i.q. like Albert E. Einstein
Now here's my theory on strategy you can't debate
Suckers never take time to concentrate
I get delirious when I hear a rap song
No concepts, no ideas, so what the hell is goin on?
Some rappers are good, and some rappers are dope
But the majority just keep relyin on hope
You can't portray an MC, you gots to be an MC
If not, put down your microphone and watch me
Cause I do the things like you never did
I'm like a hardrock on stage, but not a gangster kid
So if you wanna battle, call my company
You catch a beatdown, I'm usin strategy
Kick it

[ VERSE 3: Sugar Kay &amp; Mike Master ]
The style of the crew's too hip, so come equipped
So if you plan on battlin, you're [fuckin] with a battleship
The Kings of Swing is large and takin charge
Of the whole entourage while Cocoa steers the barge
Of the beats that the King of Chill programmed
He's on the board this time to slam and bam - damn!
And if you're smart, you won't confront nor war
And if you plan on battlin, we steppin to your front door
You wanna battle? Call my company
We're goin Rambo, we're usin strategy
Kick it
