[Hodgy Beats]
Odd Future, I shoot ya... beatch!

I'm good on a badder day, better never fabricate
I spit after I saturate the poison from a rattlesnake
From a one to ten, you're like an average eight
Blowjob, you suck, shall I elaborate?
Fuck a top down, findin my Seikos in Osaka
English no television, Japanese soul operas
High as a koala, burnin inside Impalas
Coastin, close edge, I'm on the ground like pro-pegs
They ask if I worry if my future's lookin curry
The morning's bright and early; my prize my +Temple+ +Shirley+
Shorty's ten 'per-surely' tampers through dirty hampers
Looking for the worthy answers, smoke from respiratory cancer
Fuck knowledge roll up, I'm tryin to get eminent
Everybody know me like the President, It's evident
I'm kettlin Royal, you sediment soil
You took the wrong turn now it's my turn, turmoil

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Me and my +Wolves+ be roamin in the street
Looking for a Bo Peep, bitch that we can go and eat
A nigga count sheep, go to sleep with a down ass freak
Seven times out the week (what'chu say?)

[Hodgy Beats]
O-F-Dub-G-K-T-A {*3X*}
Either join with us or step away
I'm a warrior, as I reign from the middle ages
In the Roman Empire, riding separate stages
Pencil, pages, mental cages
No sort of patience as a hit of greatness
Rose out of the pavement, a proud of amazement
Smoke right out of a basement to a spot where we makin it spacious
As God's glory is gracious say your graces for the glutton
In a chance where you're cuttin
You niggaz ain't eatin supper? Well at least you get to have somethin
Comply not to complain, when abide a food chain
The +Future's+ looking +Odd+ and yeah, things do change
Try not to restrain, shit happens like things
And the if about them thiags is if them thangs do bang

[Chorus]

[Outro]
O-F-Dub-G-K-T-A {*22X slowing down each time and fading out*}</pre>
