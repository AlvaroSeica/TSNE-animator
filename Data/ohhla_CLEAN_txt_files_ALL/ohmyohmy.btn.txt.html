[Verse 1: Sick Jacken]
My city has 'em in the same since crack flooded
Street tsunami a-blow
Casualties from cooked coke
Lowriders became riders and dropped the low
Formed armies on the block cause they smoke or slang dope
We learned to cope with no hope in my hood
Got burnt by havin' dreams to live life good
Bein' in one eighths, pawn over real estate
The battle for Pico Union keeps elevatin' the murder rate
Damagin' vertebrae, leavin' bodies with no motion
We're in a matrix, but bullets don't come in slow motion
We sell needles and [{*fuck*}] with no Trojans
That's why my cities full of disease and distortion
They tryin' to change it
With the Staples Centers cleaner
But that ain't gonna stop fiends from comin' to re-up
Get your ass out my hood if you find you can't handle this
I'm from the lost city of God
Los Angeles (Angeles...)

Chorus:
[Female] Oh my, oh my
         I'm gettin' high
         Oh my, oh my
[Psycho] For my peoples on the east to the westside (Westside...)
[Female] Oh my, oh my
         I'm gettin' high
         Oh my, oh my
[Psycho] For my peoples on the streets
         Worldwide

[Verse 2: Psycho Les]
N.Y. City
Where everything looks gritty
For this, really shitty
And we grind to the nitty gritty
Big Willie en mi boca, keep it lit, filly
Always on a move, it's hard for you to get, with me
Walk with me, I'm a tell you 'bout the dark side
Where you could die or survive it through the dark time
Drive through the wrong hood and get your fuckin' car shot
And pregnant [{*mothers drive*}] and drink
Can't this all fly
You're in the ghetto now, ain't nothin' sweeter here to hear
And foreigners take scars back to southerneers
New York, big city of fiends
Scams and schemes, let me take you to Queens
And show you how the big bosses live
You gonna notice the difference as soon as we cross the bridge
I keep buddha in the air, and a cold one in the freezer
Immigrants come here, lookin' for visa
Like that

{*Female singing to beat*}

[Verse 3: Sonny Sandoval]
They say the ghetto in the streets, that's where legends are made
If that's the case, I'm goin' down in the hood of fame
From Cedro, the rock town, to (???), the home
Ask anybody in the south, forget about it, I'm known
Sick Jack's in the zone
Set the levels and tones
Of mic checka one-two
Hit the beat and I'm gone
I twist you
Six hundred and nineteen degrees
On sixteen bars with
The Nuts, S.D.'s
In your mouth
Look how I flip it, get funky
You watch me stick it to this track
Like a heron junkie
San Dego, so love or leave, I must confess
Like seven Hail Marys in a bulletproof vest
Never pullin' a led
You can't defend it to the death
And Killer Cali's doing things you only get from the west
In the best way I know, I keep it grimey and gritty
From New York
To L.A.
To America's finest city

Repeat Chorus

[Female] Oh my, oh my
         I'm gettin' high
         Oh my, oh my
[Psycho] For my peoples on the east to the westside (Westside...)
[Female] Oh my, oh my
         I'm gettin' high
         Oh my, oh my
         I'm gettin' high
