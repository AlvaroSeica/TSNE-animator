maybe
all my life I walked, stuck in the dark
thinkin brothers that went to church had to be marks (??)
no hearts, though I had it twisted like french braids
it takes a man to serve God, this ain't no kid's trade
I got Saved and the devil wept
I wear respect to street formances as pertainin to my ghetto rag (??)
I was a shooter in my former life hoo-ride
now can I make a G slide to the bright side

[Tic Toc]
mm, if anybody can do it then you can do it Tic
well if I can do it then its done and I'm a do it quick
(why) cause I'm a doer, never seen a one truer
than me, cause this is O Double G now
you see, I got a question, but really you need to ask yourself
how do you refuse to come to Christ when He can give you help
but yet you stay, you catchin case after case
lookin left and right, up and down, when the answer's right in front yo face

maybe if, you would lift
your eyes and see (maybe)
whats crackin, step back and
peep it like a G (like a G)
maybe if, you would lift
your eyes and see (maybe)
Satan tryin to twist em, dropped in the system
let Christ set you free (set you free)

attention, O.G.'s open your ears up
and all busters stop up your ears so you cant hear us
cuz its only G talk, when we talk
and by faith with deliverance how we walk
until now ive been known to hit knees
but one time can I break it down for the G's
I left a stain so you'll never forget my name
I worship the Slain, now all gangstas ain't the same
see some bang, some slings cain, some shoot
some fight, some pray and fast, some smoke root
some claim Crypt, some hustler, and some buy root
some serves Tweed, and some serves God like I do
once was blind, but now I see, I know
I did it to greed, now freeze the G's and blow (??)
life into the hood, mourn for those that died
do's a genocide, still with one to five (??)
look at chea

maybe if, you would lift
your eyes and see (maybe)
whats crackin, step back and
peep it like a G (like a G)
maybe if, you would lift
your eyes and see (maybe)
for God so loved, sinners on Earth
that they redeemed

on the real though dog, I used to slang and bang
but from homie to homie, dont even try to gang
cuz one brotha be down, one brotha be suckas
and the other half bustas
I'm not down with killin brothas cause its killin me
and I'm not the one to contribute to your conspiracy
lift your eyes, check a nize, and stop now (??)
cuz satan wanna see the dead, are locked down (??)
or if he keep us on crack, then he got us
knowin if we toppin the purpose, he cant stop us (??)
to pen is what I need, the truth and funk is what I get you with (??)
the rhythm we givin, so they can learn from what we live thru
blacks killin blacks, blacks sellin blacks crack
now when we gone see some unity in our community?
when the G's hit they knees and get they pray on
until then homie stay strong
on the wrist (??)

maybe if, you would lift
your eyes and see (maybe)
whats crackin, step back and
peep it like a G (like a G)
maybe if, you would lift
your eyes and see (maybe)
a brighter day, a better way
for you and me

today, we done forgot about our makage as pleasure (??)
but think bout gettin our rhine on, everybody gettin they grind on
men hustlin women, and women hustle men
men hustle for skins, and women hustle for they mens
to the left, homie missed it with that set trip
in 96, half the projects read about yo chips
G wise, lets get our lives prioritised
and then start to raisin our hands, and shapin our eyes

maybe if, you would lift
your eyes and see (maybe)
whats crackin, step back and
peep it like a G (like a G)
maybe if, you would lift
your eyes and see (maybe)
a brighter day, a better way
for you and me
maybe if, you would lift
your eyes and see (maybe)
whats crackin, step back and
peep it like a G (like a G)
maybe if, you would lift
your eyes and see (maybe)
a brighter day, a better way
for you and me
maybe if you'd lift your eyes and see, yeah
maybe if youd peep it like a G (like a G)
(O Double G's, in the hizzouse, 9 6)
lift your eyes and see</pre>
