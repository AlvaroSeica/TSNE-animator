Fast lane!

...3, 2, 1, GO!

[Biolante]
Only God is judged, never plea the case
Oh reason where is the truth, we can never erase
I've fallen from Grace, black nor face
Ounce of green smoke, jack wit no chase
Peddle on the floor, thirsty for score, Fastlane
Destination: top of the cash game
See keep like a missle with mad aim
You can't blame
Missin spirits who campaign
A mystery at most, universal most stee is hot
Yup off in the knot
Vision clear like a Hindu with the third eye dot
We be wig...nah baby that's my word I got
Nuff rhymes, tuff times try talkin to kids
Who walk around thinkin that (God) doesn't forgive
Life in the self is like a bid
And if you scared to die then you scared to live
Ain't it a shame dealin with the remain
Hennesey on the brain, travel the plane

[Biolante]
Will the copy cats twist the def traps, bliss the sex raps
Blind to jet black, the matters awake in response since came to life
Singin a seance, escape the realm
Bly swift like 'o' at, fake jacks a cast
Catch two smacks, gentlemen relax
Blaze trails that haven't been traveled in a while
Scatter clues for those who equate the style

[Biolante]
Cruisin in the Lex out the window seat
While I be trippin off the rhyme bop my head to the beat
I can't speak on delirious mood swings
True crowns, a helmed at the true kings
Tell ya take it back straighten, money makin
Light we sign awaken, idle mind oversaken
No debatin on the vestle that we navigatin
Gravitatin, schemin, leave 'em standin waitin
Specialize in futuristic mental picture paintin
We are slave to sick ways, I'm quenchin with thirst
Gift of a new day they seem like a curse
What we made, penetrate the charade
The incision is barely felt from the sharpness of the blade
Movin motionless through this masquerade
Loomin in the dark, but justice save a spark (Rock)
Like a match made in Heaven and Hell apart
But still one, if it's life we start
So real reveal, sign is sealed
What we feels translates to meals
That 9 to 5 shit is no joke, muscle in
Scientist but don't look upon my hustlin

[Biolante]
Will the copy cats twist the def traps, bliss the sex raps
Blind to jet black, the matters awake in response since came to life
Singin a seance, escape the realm
Bly swift like 'o' at, fake jacks a cast
Catch two smacks, gentlemen relax
Blaze trails that haven't been traveled in a while
Scatter clues for those who equate the style

And that one's Gigan. We are controlling them."</pre>
