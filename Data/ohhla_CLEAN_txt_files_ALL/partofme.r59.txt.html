[Intro: Royce  whispering]
You took a part of me with you
You took a part of me with you
Uhh, you took a part of me with you
Ahh, ahh

[Chorus: Royce Da 5'9"]
Last night we had a one night stand
But when I woke up in the mornin I missed you
You see, all I'm sayin is can I see you again?
Cause when you left you took a part of me with you
A part of me with you

[Royce Da 5'9"]
It's like it's a, urban legend, his mistake
Her confession; how 'bout it for a first impression
How 'bout it, with the Birkin lookin perfectly measured
Lookin certain as ever like she got her purpose together or whatever
Him, he was like a typical thug
Hat and glasses, he had to bag the baddest bitch at the club
He had a, way with his words, a certain  how should I put it?
"Je ne sais quoi" is how the French bitches would mention him
Never known for lovin them all, havin them drivin his cars
Havin them in the mall on his budget ballin
Him tryin to call her is the part of the issue
He said that when she left she took a part of him with her
He ain't a stranger to the one night stand
If you lovin them you's a sucker - that's the one night sayin
But why give him the wrong number and fuck him later on girls?
That's all I'm sayin; let me tell you how they meant
He approached her with the usual swagger
"How you doin?" Blahzay-blee-blah-blah-blah, the usual blabber
Now that the, ice is broken it's time to get linked
He asked her if he could buy her a drink  she nodded to him and said
"I don't really drink but thank you for the offer (aight)
Let me buy you one and we can finish talkin (let's do that then)
How 'bout some Patron, and have him fill the cup up
(Aiyyo bartender, can you fill that up?)
And when you finish up we can get into somethin" (where we goin?)
He like it's, easy as pie, you see it in his eyes
He tryin to turn her out tonight and leave her where she lies
Tell his friend he hung her out to dry
Another bitch taps him on the shoulder and he turns around surprised
She said, "How you doin? I think I know you from somewhere (I don't think so)
Yes I do, don't you drive that Mercedes out there? (yeah that's me)
You was drivin by me one day I was walkin (word?)
You pulled over to me and we started talkin" (oh okay)
While they talkin Shorty 1 grabbed somethin out her Birkin
Tossed it in his drink and watched it sink to the surface
Shorty number 2 kept talkin like she was tryin to stall him
Long enough for that thing to dissolve in
1 gives a signal, 2 says "Who's this?"
He's like, "Sorry I'm rude" then introduces
1 to 2 - they start hittin it off
just like he wants them to, it's wonderful
He thinkin, she's a skeezer, she's just easy
They both probably bi, so they should lead to a threesome
They both probably high cause neither one of 'em drinkin
They both keep gigglin so you know what he thinkin
He swallows his Patron shot, sets the cup on top
the bar, like we gon' fuckin party, don't stop
1 cues 2 then, says "Where yo' ride at?"
He says "Hey, I let valet decide that"
They laughed, they leave, he says "Mami drive that
I'm tired or I'm high, I just wanna lie back"
They get to the hotel, they get on the elevator
He ain't feelin so well like "Fuck it, I'll get better later"
They get in the room and start takin off they clothes
Dude steppin out his shoes while he checkin out the hoes
He's sick so he sits, 1 says "Lay down"
2 says, "I'll take off his clothes, okay now?"
He loses consciousness, he dreams of number 2 ridin him
Slidin up and down with no condom
Number 1 suckin on his dick usin both hands
Both hoes dressed like nurses, I guess they role playin
He comes to as the rooms circle and comes to a stop
He not certain or not is he still dreamin (where the fuck am I?)
He feels numb so he looks down and sees
that he's layin in a tub, full of ice from his knees
to his waist, in a bathroom with grief on his face
He feelin like he too weak to move so he waits
He feel around and notices a piece of paper stickin to the tub
from his bitches and it's written in his blood (WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS?)
He panics, he screams, oh God, what's happenin?
More readin, less prayin, no time for rationin
The letter reads "Never ask for shit
Cause you can get more than you ask for, we have yo' DICK!" (AHHHHH!)
The letter reads "Never ask for shit
Cause you can get more than you ask for, we have yo' dick!"

(Bitches! *sobbing*)
You took a part of me with you (my DICK!)
