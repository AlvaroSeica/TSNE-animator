[Devo Spice]
We had a wonderful date, it was a pretty late night
that you invited me to your place, to cap it off right
You've got a beautiful place, a beautiful dress
and two cats that are makin my eyes a runny mess
But I took a couple pills and now I'm good to go
Your father's in the next room? Well that's good to know
Now the music is soft, the lights are dim
But that candle that you lit smells like my cousin Jim
No matter - you get undressed and I caress your thighs
Nibble gently at your neck and gaze deep in your eyes
Throw you down on the bed and kiss you passionately
As I begin to ooh ahh, AUGGGH~! Sorry</pre>
