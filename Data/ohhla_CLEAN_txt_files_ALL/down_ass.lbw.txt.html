Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
when I don't call you back I know it pisses you off
I'm getting to the money baby you know I'm a boss
when I'm not home I know she fiends for me
and when she all alone I know she'd be having dreams of me
ok I'm a man and she my boo
we can make it through whatever look what we've been through
and I need you to be by my side
down ass chick and she down to ride

[Verse 1]
ok I'm grinding for me and her
putting in work making sure she got plenty bread to fill up that purse
and I keep that thing wetter than a scuba diver
and she ain't never leaving me cause ain't a nigga flyer
I'm getting naked pictures straight to my e-mail from her feed mail
talking she wanna ride me like a v twelve
yea and I be gone till november
but I will leave you something to remember

[Chorus]
when I don't call you back I know it pisses you off
I'm getting to the money baby you know I'm a boss
when I'm not home I know she fiends for me
and when she all alone I know she'd be having dreams of me
ok I'm a man and she my boo
we can make it through whatever look what we've been through
and I need you to be by my side
down ass chick and she down to ride

[Verse 2]
yea I understand what she go through
got her feelings caught up you know how girls do
so you're saying you unhappy ok well rest your case
mad cause I was grinding trying to bring home the cake
so quit all these excuses and bad attitudes
i can't lie I ain't seen no woman as bad as you
yea and I be gone till november
but I will leave you something to remember

[Chorus]
when I don't call you back I know it pisses you off
I'm getting to the money baby you know I'm a boss
when I'm not home I know she fiends for me
and when she all alone I know she'd be having dreams of me
ok I'm a man and she my boo
we can make it through whatever look what we've been through
and I need you to be by my side
down ass chick and she down to ride

[Chorus]
when I don't call you back I know it pisses you off
I'm getting to the money baby you know I'm a boss
when I'm not home I know she fiends for me
and when she all alone I know she'd be having dreams of me
ok I'm a man and she my boo
we can make it through whatever look what we've been through
and I need you to be by my side
down ass chick and she down to ride</pre>
