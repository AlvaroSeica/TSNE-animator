Yo
Let's go back to the origin, clear up all the arguin'
Back to where it started, so tune up your organ
The truth'll come through and then rock your life
And cut all your lies down like a pocket knife
So pardon me as I give a little history
On the Greco-Roman gods of antiquity
The false god's birthday was on December the 25th
But this is not a reason for Christians really to resist
Cause now you see saints praisin' God in the winter
And "aint's" think of Christ on twenty-five of December
Them Roman gods in your mind ain't remembered
But Christ is the crux that resides in the center
The perfect plan- have a rival celebration
That presents the opportunity to preach the Bible in the nation
And them girls goin' wild every time on ya station
Are now forced to hear the story of the God of creation

[Chorus]
We don't celebrate Christmas as a pagan day
We celebrate Christmas as the Invasion Day
If Jesus never would have invaded in time and space
Then none of us would be saved today
Let's celebrate Christmas Oh!
We don't celebrate Christmas as a pagan day
We celebrate Christmas as the Invasion Day
If Jesus never would have invaded in time and space
Then none of us would be saved today
Let's celebrate! Oh!

[Flame]
Christmas tree, oh Christmas tree!
Idolatry is what you are perceived to be
But no, it's the result of Scripture taken out of context
So fix your mind set, cause it's not complex
Jeremiah 10:2 through 4, come into the house of truth
Let Him open the doors
The description is an idol that was made out of wood
Not a Christmas tree- if the Bible said it then I would
Plus at the time Jeremiah wrote this
Was 2,000 years before the Christmas tree would exist
Come on man, now how crazy is that?
They got saints who bought a tree goin takin em back
Besides that, in Christian Germany
In the 16th century, is where they made em at
Go search my sources
So on Christmas Eve, find me puttin' under your tree
Them yellow, white, blue and them purple Forces

[Chorus]

[Flame]
Check it, for all y'all that be straight doggin' Santa Claus
Selah, pause, selah pause, and listen
The tradition, is simply this
The Anglicized form of the Dutch name is Saint Nick
Or Sinter Klaas, who would shower the needy children with gifts
The attitude opposite of a woman with menopause
And he supported the doctrine of the Trinity
In Nicea in 325 A.D., but not the dude that be flyin' in the air
With the white beard, flyin' behind 9 or more of them deer
No, not the dude slidin' down ya' chimney
They created to dumb down what happened at Gethsemane
No, not the dude that's supposed to know if you're naughty or nice
And stole that attribute from the Lord Jesus Christ
No, but the dude who existed before
And illustrated giving like the Father sending the Lord
Yes!
