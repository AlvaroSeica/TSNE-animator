[Verse 1: Krizz Kaliko]
What the hell are you doing?
You give it up and making me want some more
Why the hell do we ruin?
A silvan go right in the closet door
I think this is heaven or hell
Baby I can't tell
You're the only thing on the menu
Bury me in you

[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]
It feels so good I hate it
Go in half on a baby
And when I get you naked
Feels like I could die!
I don't know what you gave me
I don't want you to save me
I got to get you naked
Feels like I could die inside you
Like I could die inside you
You make me feel alive

Perfect, perfect, you're perfect, perfect, you're perfect, perfect

[Verse 2: Krizz Kaliko]
If I gotta go I gotta go
I'd rather die like this
You know nobody really gotta know
This between you and Krizz
You're exactly what I don't need
But I'm in need
She said touch me till I'm in deed
Die in me

[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]
It feels so good I hate it
Go in half on a baby
And when I get you naked
Feels like I could die!
I don't know what you gave me
I don't want you to save me
I got to get you naked
Feels like I could die inside you
Like I could die inside you
You make me feel alive

Perfect, perfect, you're perfect, perfect, you're perfect, perfect
Oh my god, the music just turns me on
You're perfect, perfect</pre>
