Greetings loved ones
Let's take a journey

[Katy Perry] + (Snoop)
I, know a place
Where the grass is really greener
Warm, wet and wild
There must be somethin in the water
Sippin, gin and juice
Layin underneath the palm trees (yeah, yeah)
The boys, break their necks
Tryin to creep a little sneak peek, at us
(What, what, what?)

[Interlude: Katy Perry]
You could travel the world
But nothin comes close to the golden coast
Once you party with us
You'll be fallin in love, ohh, oh-ohhh-oh-ohhh-oh

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
California girls, we're unforgettable
Daisy dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin so hot, we'll melt your popsicle
Oh-ohhh-oh-ohhh-oh, oh, oh-ohhh-oh-ohhh-oh
California girls, we're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it on lock
West coast represent, now put your hands up
Oh-ohhh-oh-ohhh-oh, oh, oh-ohhh-oh-ohhh-oh

[Katy Perry]
Sex, on the beach
We don't mind sand in our stilettos
We freak, in my jeep {*horn honks*}
Snoop Doggy Dogg on the stereo, oh ohh

[Interlude] + [Chorus]

[Snoop Dogg]
Toned, tanned, fit and ready
Turn it up cause it's gettin heavy
Wild, wild, West coast
These are the girls I love the most
I mean the ones, I mean like she's the one
Kiss her, touch her, squeeze her buns
{*OHH!*} The girl's a freak
She drive a Jeep, and live on the beach
I'm okay, I won't play
I love the Bay, just like I love L.A.
Venice Beach, and Palm Springs
Summer time is everything
Homeboys, bangin out
All that ass hangin out
Bikinis, zuchinis, martinis
No weenies, just the king and the queenie
Katy my lady (yeah)
Ay looka here baby (uh-huh)
I'm all up on ya
Cause you representin California (ohh ohh)

[Chorus]

[Snoop Dogg] + (vocoder)
West coast, West coast, ayyy!
(California, California girls)
California girls man
Hahahaha (California)
I really wish you all could be California girls
(California girls)</pre>
