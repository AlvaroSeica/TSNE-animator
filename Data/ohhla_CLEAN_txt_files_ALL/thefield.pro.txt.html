[All verses by Profile]
I'ma let the rap world just sit back and max
I be in the lab with my technician makin' tracks
From my crate of old wax, I reinvent with good intent
So you can tell from the sound it's time well spent
Sent from the past to elevate from the mass
You far material just to show you got class
Well I'm a bigger man so I let the nonsense pass
You need to open your eyes, because my mindstates fast
Let it be known, that my wisdom is shown
That perfection is the key to unlock my microphone
I'm penetratin your zone, leavin' all spots blown
But you never would have guessed it from the sound of my tone
When you see me around, just hit me off at the pound
And I'll be the first to show you how the Pro gets down
On that note, I think it's time for me to slide
Never question the fact, it's the sound that we provide

(Dj scratches)
"Skilled in the field, so slide to the side"
"Technical difficulties is through" (3x)
"Skilled in the field, so slide to the side"
"Hey yo, technical difficulties is through"

My pen blends smoothly over paper landscapes
Collective thoughts build as I start to create
The essence of soul is dispensed at my control
? is brought, to move the crowd at every show
Ã”Cus we provide the sound that exites the underground
Profile, the chosen one to break it down
And that, enables me to flip any track
Over drums that attack, the perfect blend of pure facts
It's time to bring it back to the days of rap scholars
When your rhyme was for real, and not the old mighty dollar
You see, I was there every step of the way
So now you know the reason why my rhyme style sways
I perfect structures of phrases I sellect
And the sound that you hear, let you know that I'm correct
This is a musical journey, and sounds my only guide
I'm skilled in the field, so slide to the side

"Skilled in the field, so slide to the side"
"Technical difficulties is through" (3x)
"Skilled in the field, so slide to the side"
"Hey yo, technical difficulties is through"

Radient thoughts illuminate for the blind
A student of my culture translatin' through rhyme
Educated by time, so check my verbal design
Interject visuals through the use of the mind
It's all about the money nowadays so what's the use
The only fortune I hold, are the gems that I produce
The solution is one, but if you don't make the cut
You be the last in line once the door get shut
The next chapter, page one the conscious rapper
Not in it for fame, so respect is what I'm after
Don't have to wave a gun to help generate funds
So record exec's can start throwin' me crumbs
Top dollar, as I walk the chosen path
Invite the mic device to help me focus my craft
The wisdom is sealed, now it's time to reveal
The actual facts that help me master my field

"Skilled in the field, so slide to the side"
"Technical difficulties is through" (3x)
"Skilled in the field, so slide to the side"
"Hey yo, technical difficulties is through"

"Skilled in the field, so slide to the side"
"Technical difficulties is through" (4x)</pre>
