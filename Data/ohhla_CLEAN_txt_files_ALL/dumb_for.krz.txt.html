Typed by: AZ Lyrics

OK, did I do it, did I put the key in the door
And lock that thang down
Did I hit it? Yes I did,
On the problem is out got a friend, and he way too hot now
Chasing nothing bout Mary, so don't get carried away and get buried
It can get real dumb, and make them rekill us said this motherfuck idiot
See here's the deal, she got a baby buy some young punk
Runner run up on me, it's feeling too ill
Never check the player, check the game
You never came up home,
I don't know why you did it like that
I borrowed your girl and give her right back
Give me a little bit of ris out of the carpet that
I have a side bar, she don't know how to act
You better get her
She got go women like it was born in 'er
The big old booty keep me warm in the cold winter
It can go stupid, that means I'm going easy
Where you find her from? Firearri

And I'm about to go stupid
And I'm always representing where I'm from
From from from from from from
And if a nigga wanna try me, better tell him roll right by me when he come
Come come come come come come
Hey, I'm about to go dumb for you, dumb for you, dumb for you, dumb for you
Hey, I'm about to go dumb for you, dumb for you, dumb for you
Hey, I'm about to go
You're one hundred, we so hunterish
And you'll be mokin' her when she's bumpin' this

Mister goodie good could change it to make it good
I love to keep the piece but I wish a nigga would
Leggo it would be different if she sell out
Then you know what you had before
If I cock it then let it go
You go six she lonely and chose me
You boarded home alone and tried to blame it on me
Keep my family riding with me but sometimes I'm so lo
You don't know I can really make it go dodo
And I ain't have to force her to come
Divorce her, before it gets dumb

And I'm about to go stupid
And I'm always representing where I'm from
From from from from from from
And if a nigga wanna try me, better tell him roll right by me when he come
Come come come come come come
Hey, I'm about to go dumb for you, dumb for you, dumb for you, dumb for you
Hey, I'm about to go dumb for you, dumb for you, dumb for you
Hey, I'm about to go

Aha, T-Pa-a-ain
Okay, Kali baby</pre>
