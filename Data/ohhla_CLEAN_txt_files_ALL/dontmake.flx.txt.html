[Verse Two: Ace Hood]
I say, fuck all that talkin all my money do that, gettin some head in the back of the back
Still I'm 'gon ride with the strap on my lap and some whip in that 'lac that's a matter of fact
Still smokin on that good good, nail a bitch with this good wood
Fuck around with my people dog and this death rollin that nigga shook
Say long money, tour bus, eat a rapper like cold cuts
Make a check and I blow it all and it's fuck a hater like four sluts

Eighty gram for that cube flo' and my pockets fatter than sumo

All this ice around my collar got me coolin (BLING BLAOW!!!)

[Verse Three: Meek Mill]
Oh lord, I'm feelin myself

Hold up! She pop molly pop that pussy, he puffs loud we pop that pussy
That's yo' chick I got that pussy I treat that shit like project pussy
