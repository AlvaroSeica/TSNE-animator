It's the dirty south, the dirty south, the dirty south (repeat 2X)
 
(Redd)
down south we wear bandannas and denim suites 
down south you gone always spot us in them coupes
 
(Lil' Flip)
well down south we drivin bentleys and jaguars
and we play all our hoes like a game of flash cars
 
(H.A.W.K.)
down south we bout that dolla dolla
grab a trick then hit and make em holla holla
 
(Lil' Flip)
Down South we eatin Timmy Chan's and noodles
I just bought an Escalade and a PT cruiser
 
(Redd)
down south my wrist stay below freezin
down south my niggas brag for no reason
 
(Lil' Flip)
in down south everybody shop in the galeria
I dont care about the price I drop money like diarhea
 
(H.A.W.K.)

(Lil' Flip)

ugly birds get shot down like duck hunt
 
(Lil' Flip)
down south at my concerts I'm packin em in
and you can see my diamonds from the back of my hand
 
(H.A.W.K.)

CHORUS:
It's the dirty south, it's just the dirty south, 
It's the dirty south, the dirty south, the dirty south
 
(Lil' Flip)

86 baggets clogin my rang
 
(Redd)
down south we count money on the back of the jags
but if I'm broke you gone find me with a gat in the mast
 
(H.A.W.K.)
