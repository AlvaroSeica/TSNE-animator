Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Intro]
When my emotion grows, I still won't let it show
I still won't let it show
Even if I'm broke, I still won't let it show
I still won't let it show; I won't let it show

[Tyga]
Nigga, welcome to my life
Life feels like I'm runnin through a red light
Don't believe what the blogs write
Muh'fuckers wanna know me so they call me Mike
I'm just chillin, watchin the fight
Few friends, fake girls, po' me some ice
Table glass, slippers on, lower the blinds
Never been shy, I just ignore lies
Take a look into Tyga's eyes
I breathe love, but inhale the hate bomb
So numb my face gone
I need +MySpace+ and I don't do Facebook
Serious look how my face look
How could a man cry while the crowd looks?
Could you walk with me if I give you my foot?
Didn't think you could

[Chorus]
When my emotion grows, I still won't let it show
I still won't let it show
Even if I'm broke, I still won't let it show
I still won't let it show
My mind overloads, I still won't let it show
I still won't let it show
People I love the most, I still won't let it show
I still won't let it show, I won't let it show

[Tyga]
I don't wanna feel like most rappers feel when they get a deal
like "Yeah I'm bigger than him"
He's still loco, gotta keep it real cause they will go loco
like "He ain't ever go through shit, we go through"
So I guess now I owe you
Oh no I hold you, watch them niggaz close to you
Don't compare careers his and his fools
Acting like I knew you back in middle school
Dropped out, momma said I was a fool
I brought the drop out, now me and momma cool
Told her I won't lose, showed her a Jimmy Choo
She call me son now, tell me she real proud
Smiles, uh-huh, oh what a feelin to be loved
Oh what a feelin to be loved
I wish I could fly like a dove

[Chorus]

[Tyga]
I've learned that.. people will forget what you say
People will.. forget what you did or done
But people will never forget, how you made them feel
Don't cry because it's over; smile because it happened

[J. Cole]
Yeah, hey~! +Cole World+, niggaz ran for that heat
As the globe twirl gotta stay up on your feet
Before I say it to my girl, I say it to the beat
Then I play it for the world and they say that shit is.. deep
My life is changin as we speak
They acting like they never seen a nigga on the beach
I say "peace" hope it ain't no sharks in my water
Then holla at my momma, man she love to see Obama
do his, thang; now look how far niggaz done came
They had us on the chains, now we coppin bigger chains
I ain't sayin that it's smart, old nigga don't trip
but they had us with the whips, now we coppin bigger whips
Aww shit! Wonder how bad will it get 'fore we rise
I'm out here trying to get rich
I survive and a nigga got God to thank
And I'm still throwin five in the tank, nigga
Cole
