[Zack De La Rocha]
This time the bullet cold rocked ya
A yellow ribbon instead of a swastika
Nothin' proper about ya propaganda
Fools follow rules when the set commands ya
Said it was blue, when ya blood was red
That's how ya got a bullet blasted through ya head
Blasted through ya head, blasted through ya head
I give a shout out to the living dead
Who stood and watched as the feds cold centralized
So serene on the screen, you was mesmerized
Cellular phones, soundin a death tone
Corporations cold turn ya to STONE before ya realize
They load the clip in, omnicolor
Said they pack the nine, they fire it at prime time
The sleeping gas, every home was like Alcatraz
and muthafuckas lost their minds!

[Chorus]
Just victims of the in-house drive-by...
They say jump, you say how high...Yeah
Just victims of the in-house drive-by...
They say jump, you say how high...

Run it!

[*Tom Morello's wah-wah guitar solo]

[Chorus]

Checka, checka, check it out
They load the clip in, omnicolor
Said they pack the nine, they fire it at prime time
The sleeping gas, every home was like Alcatraz
and mutha-FUCKAS lost their minds!
No escape from the mass mind rape
Play it again jack, and then rewind the tape
and then play it again and again and again
until ya mind is locked in
Believin all the lies that they're tellin ya
Buyin all the products that they're sellin ya
They say, "Jump" and ya say, "How high?"
Ya brain-dead! Ya gotta fuckin' bullet in ya head!

[Chorus]

[*instrumental break*]
UGH!
Yeah!!
Yeah!
FUCK!

Ya standin in line...
Believin the lies...
Ya bowin down to the flag...
Ya gotta bullet in ya head...

Ya standin in line...
Believin the lies...
Ya bowin down to the flag...
Ya gotta bullet in ya head...

A bullet in ya head...
A bullet in ya head...
A bullet in ya head...
A bullet in ya head...
A bullet in ya head..
A bullet in ya head..
A bullet in ya head.
A bullet in ya head!
A bullet in the head!!
