[Mr. Prezident]
Iron in the kitchen, and I'm pitching by the corner store
You already know, same shit, different toilet bowl
Can't call it though, bang til the drama stop
Now the blocks is just about as hot as a lava drop
Gotta watch for cops, when you making cream
Whistle, I ain't bet you, I'm just pitching like the Major Leagues
I know how to move, move up a block or two
It get hot, shit, we do what we gotta do
Get it popping then, can't box me ini
Need bread like plants need oxygen
Me? I gotta win, any drama friend
I put the llama to ya face like oxyten
What your life like, high off the light life
You ain't getting money, you should walk towards the bright lights
Dang, lived finesse, fucked up, nigga
Shit is real, but I buck up, nigga

[Chorus 2X: Fes Taylor (Mr. Prezident)]
They say you foul, got issues
So shoot it out, ref blow the whistle
(What your life life, we live the trife life
Shoot outs and knife fights, what your life like)

[Fes Taylor]
I push ya wig back, I aim where his wig at
He do the Dipset, your grave, you can dig that
This Wolfpack, fuck around, get your bitch slapped
Heard she a easy fuck, blunt and a six pack
You can't rap, get a job, you should stick to that
My silverbacks, niggas get killed with that
Wolf with a platinum pull, dough, what up?
So everything I touch muthafuckas know, I even do that or more
Nights I throw Gladys on, or Stacy Lattimore
Just to calm my nerves, nah, this ain't a battle song
How I go to war, with some chipmunk punks
All of ya'll, I just pick up lunch, I ain't hiccup once
Guzzlin' Henny, blunts to the face
Next BET AWards, getting punched in your face
My life like a vision from Goines
Life or death at the flip of a coin, heads or tails, nigga

[Chorus 3X]</pre>
