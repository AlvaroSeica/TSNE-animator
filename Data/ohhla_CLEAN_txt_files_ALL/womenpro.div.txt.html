[Chorus]
My Homie said that he was going through it, going through it
My Pops said that he was going through it, uh
My uncle said that he was going through it, going through it
Even my little cousin going through it
And na na na, now I'm talking bout my Women Problems
Cause I got me some Women Problems
I need help with my Women Problems
Cause I got me some Women Problems

[Verse 1: Big Mibbs]
Uh uh, Damn baby, you the one who's actin crazy
Catch me dancing with some lady now you talking bout you hat me
In the party drunk and Shwayzy trying to punch me over Stacy
So loud the crowd hear you cursing over Jay-Z
Now this is for instance the shit that I was talking bout
Big Mibbs can't go to shindigs without you walking out
Mad at the world, at them girls that be eyeing me
Trying to see if I'm a be the type to Creep
Find a Freak, buy em drinks, Lie and Cheat
Damn why you Spying me, Last week I caught you at the mall
Playing Hide and Seek
After all of this might as well call it quits
Cause I never called you bitch, never ever balled my fist
Never ever tried to hit you
And it's a understatement if I said you got some issues
Quite crying here's a tissue
You swear like I'm against you, but you the one I'm into
You keep this up and I'm a blow the whistle
Girl you mental, uh

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Likewise]
My girl problems go way before Junior High
Nicky used to diss me, with some prissy little cutie pie
Daniel rejected my fan mail, Remember writing letters to Quinetta
She would shred em when she get em, you know
The folded letters with the question in the circle box
I was cryin when Shania stole my Ninja Turtle Watch
The Purple Watch it was Donatello
Elice was cute but the teeth behind her braces was kinda yellow
And I can tell that Shanell liked me
The only problem with her ass is she smelled like pee
Casey and Lacy the twin sisters they was tap dancers
But they was stingy, wouldn't let me play Math Blaster
Morgan? Well she let me play Oregon Trail
But her breath had a foreign smell
Only talk to Courteney when I'm bored as hell
And then Porches tail, was lying ass cheating ass whore for real
Behind the bungalows, tongueing up different dudes
Skipping school, kissing who?
Damn you at this nigga fool
And to this day ain't shit improved
My bad luck with the women got me stuck in dilemmas and

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: BeYoung]
We was going on 3 years this summer
Deep in still love her
Never ever did I see this here coming
Queasy in the stomach, knee deep, started buggin
Seen this would lead me into something
This the start, homecoming 06'
Got word that she had a friend she was close with
Spending dough with, heard he was quarterback for Howard
Paranoid I call he back for hours
The phone calls slowing up, Holidays no showing up
Her momma say she goin nuts, so I already know what's up
Last I heard she was in the campus, letting niggas tap her
When she swore she was going just to get her masters
First plane heading to the campus, Crashed in the classes
And I'm askin, Where's room one eight two
Bustin through the door, seen jeans to the ankle
Daaamn uh

[Chorus]</pre>
