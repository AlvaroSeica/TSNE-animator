Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
So I ride, I lean, I crawl do it better then them all
Let the road be my guide as I glide in candy cars
Underneath the moon and the stars

[Big K.R.I.T]
Yo, my digital dash as I mash on the gas
Don't know where I'm going fast but I'm goin there
Stop at a club foreva sho there's some hoes in there
Shakin they ass lookin for playas with dough to share
But that ain't me though
Before I trick on ya bussy baby
I'm outta the door
If you were looking for savings shawty
I'm not your hero
More like the guy that can take you where wanted to just look in my eye
Like you suppose to cold enough to froze ya
Talking bout that pimpin that you already been exposed to
Far from being sober let's travel into space while
Puffin on this yoda blowin like a light saber
Doin what the grown ups do
Be grateful that this game be bestowed up onto you
Those backstab men betrayed us advise don't listen to
Cause they front but they don't do what I do cause they will never ever be pimps

[Chorus]
O I ride, I lean, I crawl do it better then them all
Let the road be my guide as I glide in candy cars
Underneath the moon and the stars

[Killa Kyleon]
Runnin back on that butterscotch
Got my paint lookin peppamint
Pull a pace in a pokas puffin that purple that's evident
Smell the scent I can see the moon and the stars through my evidence
Louie v don't see haters no focus cause they irrelevant
Comin through like the president
Wave at boppas and droppas
I let my trunk do the jump
And they flag us down and they stop us
Flock us like waka like tv shows they watch as you see these hoes
Mesmerized like khalifa
Pulled up in slab do you see these fours
This is ain't not time for dis purple
Drink do you see me pour
And my cook got them double stacks like that x
Do you see me roll
Paint wet like it's aroused
So high I can kiss the clouds
I roll up in sour flowers and smoke till I'm lookin yow
I'm stuck on this country shit
I'm southern just like the college
Neck bones cornbread candy yams and my greens colli
Crawlin just like a talla pradas pushin them pedals down
Jackas keep me in Magneto mode I keep that metal round

[Chorus]

[Curren$y]
I be obliged if you stepped outside
Smoking that bum ass shit bitch
You get no play in this ride
Butta soft high
They built many vettes after mine but I think they did it best in 89'
Idling at the red light mindin my business
Holdin my weed low with a slight crack in my windows
Playin all three of my mirrors
I ain't nervous
But I'm certain that them devils tryin to get me
Cause I'm swerving banging curbs
And they can't stand to see me with it
But it don't stop just provoke me
More to drop my top
Now be planetarium status
Flickin ashes in the big dippa
You ain't as high as me mista
I's screwin your sister
From a fifty foot distance
Now she missin caught up in a twista
Tropicana pour me up a glass of tang
Roll up some of that NASA mane
Yessir
