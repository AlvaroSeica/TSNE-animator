Typed by: AZ Lyrics

All round the world I'm seeing all them pretty girls
Only one I need and only thing that I been thinking 'bout
Is you girl, you, yeah, you girl yeah, yeah

Only fantasy and only one I want to see
Early in the morning, only one that keeps me holding on
Is you

Always on my mind, at any place, at any time
Girl, way you so fine control the rhythm of my heart
And this is you girl, you, yeah, you girl, yeah, yeah

Feel you in my soul, it is my heart that you can know
Look into your eyes are more than diamonds, olden gold
I need you, the need is you

Hotter than anyone or anything I've ever seen
Sexier than all the girls in all the magazines
And that's true girl, you, yeah, cool, yeah

Sharper than a razor blade but still be burning me
Blazing on the freeway doing more than eighty three
And that's cool

Favorite place to go, is any place that we's alone
Smelling finer than the ocean got me putting down my phone
And that's cool girl, you, yeah, cool, yeah, you, yeah

Hotter than the weather, love is harder than a stone
Anywhere we come together we can call it home
And that's you, girl it is you</pre>
