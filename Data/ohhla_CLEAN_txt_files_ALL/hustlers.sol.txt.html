[Intro: Solomon Childs]
Ya'll niggas need to read the bible, we in Revelations
They told you God was coming..

[Chorus: Solomon Childs]
Yell it with me (hustle, hustle)
Get it with me (hustle, hustle)
See it with me (hustle, hustle)
Huh, huh? (hustle, hustle)

[Solomon Childs]
I go the E. on the block, the D. on the block
The bread off the block, I be on the block
With the cherry red V. on the block
You niggas sports wear, NBA gear
Fly on the block, clientele off the chain
From the taste of the rock, try'nna go behind my back
And steal my custies'll get you popped
Whatever the deals, who deals, peels
All color bags and crills
Hustlers, gotta combine, when you looking for mills
Sending them chills, up and down your spine
It's the flow of money that make you hungry, homey
When you on the block and the heat's to the mack
You keep one in the head, when you sitting in your bedroom, counting your stacks
Fiends be running like horses on the race track

[Hook: Solomon Childs]
Listen, I'm on my grizzly, and I'm a paper chaser
Although the glocks be busting, I won't stop
Cuz the hot boys are coming

[Chorus]

[Solomon Childs]
Here comes the rule, close ya pharmacy at ten
Cuz no matter morning or night
Police looking to throw you in the pen
Never play the blocks, too jiggy
Never let a crack head get too biggie
Never rock a walkman or a CD player
Cuz muthafuckas is grimey in the hood
And won't warn you when they coming for you, playa
If you get high, wait til your pack's finished
Cuz the paranoia'll stagnate your business
Never pull out a knot of money
To profile for them bitches, cuz muthafuckas is snitches
You can see 'me walking down the block, when they twitching
Last rule, don't be fronting in the kitchen
Playing with fire, get ya burnt in the kitchen

[Hook]

[Chorus]

[Solomon Childs]
I go the E. on the block, the D. on the block
The bread off the block, I be on the block
With the cherry red V. on the block
You niggas sports wear, NBA gear
Fly on the block, clientele off the chain
From the taste of the rock, try'nna go behind my back
And steal my custies'll get you popped

[Hook]
