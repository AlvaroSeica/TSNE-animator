[M.C.A.D.]
(Verse 1)
I'm fascinated with pussy, patron and Percocet
I graduated to groupie love and dirty sex
Infatuated and runnin' with the devil
I'm a God, I'm a rebel
I'm a dawg, I'm a fucking mess
You wanna get it on my personal armageddon
You threatened by my recklessness, you powerless
I'm obsessed
I'm possessed with the heart of a warrior
Born and raised in southern killer California
I got that bubblegum, yeah, I got that JD
But JD only make a nigga crazy
But (???) meister
Make a nigga nicer
And grey goose help the groupies get loose
Yeah, there's a demon inside, that slow suicide
That can't be denied
The Jeckyl and Hyde, that Bonnie and Clyde, you dig
No regrets, no stress, never vex, no
Take your time, you got time, you the next, yo

Chorus: hed pe
Uh oh, uh oh, come over tonight
There's a ride in the parking lot, we dancing in the moonlight
Hey, hey
Let your hair ride
You a rock star {*gunshot*}
Larger than life
Uh oh, uh oh, come over tonight
There be fightin' in the parking lot, and fuckin' in the moonlight
Hey, hey
Let your hair ride
You a rock star {*gunshot*}
Larger than life

Hook: M.C.A.D.
Rock-rock, rock-rock
Rock-rock, rock, star (Yeah)
Let everybody know
I just don't give a fuck (Fuck...)

(Verse 2)
Mommy, I smoke and I drink
I fuck, I fight, and I stay
Punk rock for life, get high
In the club all night {*gunshot*}
Mommy, I know what you want
The other boy not doin' it right
You come on over and I'll fuck you all night
For real, though

Bridge: hed pe
Shorty, I know you feel the electricity
Feel the fire rising, come and smoke a joint with me
It's prophecy, a punk rock opera, see
And all the shots are free, when shorty rocks with me

(Verse 3)
Come on, come on
Forget about games, just give me that thang, gotta get inside her
I'm a little insane, gotta give her that pain, when I'm right behind her
Wanna get her back home, when I get her alone, I'm gonna hurt her
Homicide, serial killer, baby, I'll murder ya

Repeat Chorus

Repeat Hook Twice

[Verse 3: Roscoe]
I live my life on the edge
So I might just jump, if you don't push me
Got the infrared
On the ride, punk
For punk, pussies
I pull up in the Bentley, I feel the good weed and Hennesey
Truck
Full of fullies and semis for my enemies
Am I foolish for my ways, maybe
But I'm gettin' paid, baby
Grew up in the 80's, they labelled us Ronald Reagan babies
Obsessed with money and sex, cars and jewelry
Everybody dyin', who's next
Could be you and me
Heavily sedated, I never been this faded
Investigators persuin' me
Tapin' my conversation
Cause the shit I say'll probably get my killed (Like you)
Niggas wanna body me, but I don't think they will (Will)
Scarface
Gotti got a posse, a dog face who was shot
He's in the car chase
Tryin' to escape
From paparazzi
I'm a block star, known as a glock star, when shots pop
Off in the moonlight
Duckin' from cop cars

Repeat Chorus

Repeat Hook Twice

[M.C.A.D.]
That was (???)
Homicide, serial killer, baby, I'll murder ya
Ha ha
Yeah

[Roscoe]
Rock star
Hood star
True star (Oooh)
Pass that shit (Superstar)
Light that shit up
Hit that (Superstar)</pre>
