Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Yeh
You got me
Got me like

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh woah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1:]
I touch the guilt in your eyes
As your lips begin to lie
And it kills me every time
But I always learn the hard way (with you)
Just be cool
Be kind
Don't be dumb
Don't be blind
It's the sweet
That's in your smile
It's nothing new
Nothing new

[Chorus:]
But I always learn the hard way
And it always ends in heartbreak
You put me in an odd place
I always learn the hard way
My heart breaks with you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh woah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2:]
I don't cry
I don't complain
There's a pattern
To this pain
Just keep hopin'
That could change
But I always learn the hard way (with you)
Let's just face it
I'm complacent
I'm just comfortable
Yes, I'm jaded
And it's all my fault
'Cause I know what to expect so it's cool
Nothing new

[Chorus:]
So I always learn the hard way
And it always ends in heartbreak
You put me in an odd place
I always learn the hard way
My heart breaks with you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh woah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Breakdown:]
Apologies
And promises
Our empty words
Same ol' [echoes]
Yesterday
We were on
And you were here
And now your gone

[Chorus:]
Said I always learn the hard way
And it always ends in heartbreak
You put me in an odd place
I always learn the hard way
My heart breaks with you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh woah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh woah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh</pre>
