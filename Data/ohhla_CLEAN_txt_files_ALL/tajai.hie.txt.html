You best to watch yo knot if 
The styles get chaotic
Niggaz'll plague me bubonic
But when I move on it
They stay free
Feet no hands at least
And say "Peace!"
Cause it's lethal when released
Defending?  Please...
Watch me slice these cheesy MC's
With 5 ounces of milky smooth enrichment
Each encroachment's intolerable
I'm too committed and these flows is volatile
Wither with other music in it and this
Industry in a sense is lost
And my only guidance is inner sense and energy
Enervating
What I'm saying will bust your innards
Innovating
That's why implicating us as winners
There's no mistake, emerging sole victorious
An urgency felt in every flow we bust
With surgeon reminiscent precision
Even around the contours, curves and incursions
We gettin in visual gettin busy
More so than Aunt Kizzy's
More so than bout any MC that touch mics
What that look like, what that sound like?
I'll give you a second 
Cause ain't no description sufficient
For how we wreckin on records I recommend
I rack and ruin all encompassable
With a position at our beckon and call
Butt naked ball, I bare it to yall
For you to stare at
Too bad if you can't bear it, I'm gone
Out there</pre>
