[Chorus: Childish Gambino]
I got a PJ for the whole crew
Passport lookin old news
Champagne in a glass house
Old money know what I'm about
Put your money in that real estate
I put my money in that real estate
I put my money in that real estate
Nigga I'm from Georgia, that's the realest state

[Childish Gambino]
I'm feelin like New Zealand, charge it to the Am-Ex
Gotta use that latex or she livin like a princess
They don't wake you up in private, let a nigga sleep
I got houses in the mountains, man Will Smith live down the street
Got that generation money, my grandkids are assholes
Stackin somethin dummy, every verse I got got cash flow
Monaco they loved me, I'm wearin somethin ugly
But they still know I'm rich though so my do-rag lookin stuffy
Rollin with the royalty, Kauai is just my Camelot
Glass house, champagne, white shirt, no socks, no top
Saint Bart's, pushin 997's like I'm makin fuckin phone calls
Half a mil' is low ball
God of diamonds, Lite-Brite, whiskey older than Betty White
Spot me on Dalmatian Coast, Croatian girls salvation us
Make somethin of myself man, somebody let 'em know
Cause it's that Eastside nigga {"A-T-L!"}

[Chorus]

[Alley Boy over Chorus]
That real estate
Get that real estate
You know how we doin it nigga
Duct tape nigga, A-Boy

[Alley Boy]
Ridin 'round with a whole meal, real estate, can a nigga live?
Gold slug no ice grill, deal with molly, no X pill
Georgia nigga I'm A-town, Eastside, nation-wide
Rep nigga like Tim Briggs, killed 'em, homicide
Real estate, that's my estate, Georgia peach, I'm like Big Meech
Mason Ave, that's my street, we sellin crack on Front Street
Old money got dust on it, old chopper got rust on it
New crib, ticket on it, just cashed out seven figures on it
Baby mama, stank bitch, fought child support, I'm too rich
Pussy hoe got lucky, you can pay your bills on my dick
My driver license suspended, but I'm still ridin in a Bentley
I'm still strapped with that semi, real estate we winnin
Me and Childish Gambino, plenty chips no casino
Poppin bottles with models, they gon' suck us some pronto
Put my grill in your real estate, know I come from that realest state
Niggaz eatin off a paper plate, we just copped them new Audi 8's
Yeah

[Chorus] - 2X

[Outro 1: Swank]
Man, Atlanta showin love too man
Shout out to Eastside, shout out to Southside, Westside
And fuck the Northside, man them niggaz up there be testin
Ain't nothin changed man, we still get money out here
"Royalty" forever in this bitch, Gambino nigga, youknow'msayin?
That new shit man, come see about
One time for the one time man, real niggaz stand up
Two times for the bad bitches, three for the rich
You know what I'm talkin 'bout? Yeah man
Cuz you know what it is man, yeah man
Money talk, bullshit walk a marathon
Real niggaz know what I'm talkin 'bout
"Royalty" forever motherfucker, Gambino forever motherfucker
Get used to it, "Royalty" nigga, "Royalty" motherfucker
Motherfuckin Eastside stand up, Stone Mountain, L-town
We in this bitch like we fuckin a dog or some shit my nigga
Man y'all motherfuckers already know what it is
"Royalty" forever in this bitch, bitch niggaz fall back
Real recognize real and y'all sucka niggaz ain't it
You feel me? Man don't watch me, watch TV
Wait, 'Bino on that shit too, goddamn!
Man we gettin that white people money, you heard that?
Matter of fact Tina, tell these niggaz what I'm talkin 'bout one time!

[Outro 2: Tina Fey]
Yeah, we in here, we in this thing
Gambino is forever, "Royalty" is forever
We ballin 'til we fuckin up the hardwood homie
This is the life we live son
My President is black and my Prius is blue motherfucker!
"Royalty" all day, we droppin racks in Nordstroms son
That's racks on racks damn it
You feel me? You feel me?
This is the part where most people would say somethin crazy and drop the N-word after it
Not going to, not gonna do that, I don't feel comfortable!
I'm OUT~!</pre>
