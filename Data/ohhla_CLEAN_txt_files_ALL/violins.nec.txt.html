(Intro):
Go home
Go now, in peace
If you do not go now, you will be buried in this field
I've seen enough.. blood
But if you want more, I can't stop you
I can only warn you, that it will be your blood, not ours

(Necro):
Evil is anointed, get disappointed
Guillotine to your spleen
You'll get defeated, you can't beat it, join it - what
Death comes in the worst way, through satanic wordplay
Here's a knife in your spine, happy birthday - bitch
Bile Lubrication, crack vial rejuvenation
Subdue my patient, persue cremation - ahhhhhh
Insert a lance in your back through the circumstance
You're dead, over your corpse I do a murder dance - hahahaha
I'm on some stab you with a shank shit
My language is filled with frankness, and anguish, youre anxious
Greetings to all cretins, to those bleeding from repeated beatings
I'm like a snake at Eden - ssssssssssssssssssssssssss
You're down with Necro, be loyal
Or get strangled with a scarf til you barf
What goes around recoils
My conversation disects you like operation
My obligation is to kill nazis with concentration - kill 'em!
Romance, ain't a slow dance
It's a slut with no pants, suckin and holdin my dick with both hands - slut
Put a gun to your pockets
My steez would blind the eyepiece of a high priest like the sun to his sockets

(Mr Hyde): x2
Violins of violence will thrive off destruction
It's Necro abduction with Hyde corruption
You flirt with escape but that's in the clip
Cause happy endings are not in the script

(Necro):
I drop english vocab distastefully, gracefully
With a machete strapped on my hip i'm in the place to be
Reppin brutality faithfully
My religions sin
Bash a pigeon in, i'm belligerant
Peace to all midgets in america
With short ligaments, do your thing
Size dont mean shit, any nigga could win
Talkin out your ass is great
You'll get drastic hate
Force you to masticate, a fuckin plastic plate
I got your brain through acquisition
Mow youre on the streets smokin crack on a mission
Lookin like an apparition
Your death is like angelic
The splatterin of your guts makes a beautiful pattern - It's psychadelic
Kiss your last hundred dollars bye - Your wallets mine
Scream holler cry you've been disqualified
My demented thoughts need to be vented and sacramented
Your tendons blended are splendid

(Mr Hyde): x2
Violins of violence will thrive off destruction
It's Necro abduction with Hyde corruption
You flirt with escape but that's in the clip
Cause happy endings are not in the script</pre>
