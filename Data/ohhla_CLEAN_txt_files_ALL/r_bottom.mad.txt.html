[Intro]
("Yo!") Mad Child, Battle Axe Records
The resurrection (resurrected) I can do...
Yo and, warriors are in effect
Battle Axe warriors, yeah

[Mad Child]
I do what takes you five years in one summer
Cold stunner, came up fast like Roadrunner
People sayin Mad's on the come-up
But then I fell doing drugs until sun-up
Used to get a lot of hummers, in my new white Hummer
Now I'm broke, life's a bummer
Caked up layin pipe like a plumber
Now Mad Child's the one that they make fun of
Standing in a dark tunnel, but there's no light
Feels impossible for anything to go right
Dark winters, cold summers
Hard to feel fresh in 5 year-old runners
So sullen, life's duller, no color
Teeth fucked up like Old Yeller
Cold chillin, old villain, no feelings
Rock bottom, no ceiling
Put the kid out of his misery, go kill him
I thought it's goin down but I guess that they don't feel him
I'm clinically insane which is limiting my brain
Now I'm looking for a cure tryin to remedy the pain
I found it then I took it things will never be the same
Now I'm leanin standin crooked while I'm trippin off my name
Yeah, ahh, yo I'm mentally ill
If the drugs don't kill me the memories will
All my enemies will, flag planted up on Vanity Hill
Stick around and see my sanity spill
I don't need a hammer to kill, I'm in Amityville
I'm an amateur from Canada still
I was thinkin I was someone tryin to stand up on stilts
Now I'm lookin in the mirror like this can't be the deal</pre>
