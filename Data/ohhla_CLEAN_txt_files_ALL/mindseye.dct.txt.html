[in my mind, I can see your face
As your love pours down in a shower of grace
Some people tell me that you're just a dream
My faith is the evidence of things unseen]

In my mind's eye, in my mind's eye
In my mind's eye, in my mind

You know what I'm going through
I know this is true
'cause you stood in my shoes
Desire's inside of me
But it's hard to believe
In what you cannot see

Can you catch the wind?
See a breeze?
It's presence is revealed by
The leaves on a tree
An image of my faith in the unseen

[Chorus]
In my mind's eye
I see your face
You smile as you show me grace
In my mind's eye
You take my hand
We walk through foreign lands
The foreign lands of life

In my mind's eye, in my mind's eye
In my mind's eye, in my mind

In my mind I'm where I belong
As I rest in your arms
And like a child I hold on to you
In my moment of truth, yes I do

We can ride the storm
Endure the pain
You comfort me in my hurricane
And I'll never be alone again

[Chorus] - 2X

In my mind's eye, in my mind's eye
In my mind's eye, in my mind

In my mind I can see your face
Love pours down in a shower of grace
Life is a gift that you choose to give
I believe we eternally live
Faith is the evidence of things unseen
People tell me that you're just a dream
But they don't know you the way that I do
You're the one I live to pursue

Can you catch the wind?
[can you see god, have you ever seen him?
I've never seen the wind
I seen the effects of the wind
But i've never seen the wind]
Can you see the breeze?
[there's a mystery to it]

[Chorus]

In my mind's eye, in my mind's eye
[I see you there again]
In my mind's eye, in my mind's eye
[I know you'll meet me there my friend]
In my mind's eye, in my mind's eye
[I know you're there, I can touch you there]
In my mind's eye, in my mind's eye
[I want you there, I need you there, I see you there, I know you care]
[and I believe, and I believe, and I believe]</pre>
