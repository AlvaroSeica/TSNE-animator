Typed by: AZ Lyrics

So you really wanna know how I freak it..

Bangin' bones on Roland
Jungle rottin'
Chicken skeletal system bombin'
Unidentified genre abductor
Hit it from the back
Formula fucker
Hooded executor of
Cookie cutter
Can't wait to pull dat trigger shut gunner

So you really wanna know

Cock the hammer
Droppin' thunder
Double helix stopper under
Influence of dat
Head knock what a
O fuckin' g, whata uh
O fuckin' g, fuck it up
Bitch you don't know me
Run it blood ride reel to reel low key
How's it feel, feel, feel, easy
Make it bloody, make it bloody
Ain't really nothin' else
I see any more
Gone in the cause
I'm bleeding for

So you really wanna know..
So you really wanna know how I freak it
Double helix

Live in a trance can't see you
Don't want to anyway anywhere
What'd you say forgot you were even there
Head float astray
Clear the air
Be back when you think I'm gone
Blue jay way, don't belong
Double helix phoenix
From beyond

So you really wanna know how I freak it

Rorschach ink blot
In the street
Skid row mark
Show me the beast
I'm the lust, you can't hide
That balled up, fist gut inside
Strapped ta, suicide
Missions set off
With so much pride
You can see it
In a dead man's eyes
So you really wanna know..

No maps wit directions
No answers, just questions
Second guessing everything you swore was so can't
Tell you what to do
But I'll tell you why I threw
All the rules out the window
And took an oath to be true
Wit the one and only view
A man can ever truly know (know)

So you really wanna know..
So you really wanna know how I freak it
Double helix

Been there and back
'nuff tracks I am
The rail to the road
We run like scam
Drop it on the one
And it's on like damn
Well I never thought
Uh huh, oh yeah
Like I didn't know
Wake up young blood
Ain't nobody sleepin'
And they never was
Off the cliff in a blur of black blood and hoodou hexin guts
I thought you heard dem ghetto birds hollarin every time I bust
Swallow it down and lap it up can't do that, I'ma have to cut
Double..

So you really wanna know..
So you really wanna know how I freak it..
