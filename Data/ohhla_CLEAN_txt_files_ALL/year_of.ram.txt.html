[Zack de la Rocha]
The sistas are in, so check the front line
Seems I spent the '80s in the Haiti State of Mind
Cast me into classes for electro shock
Straight incarcerated, the curriculum's a cell block
I'm swimmin in half truths and it makes me wanna spit
Instructor come separate the healthy from the sick
You weigh me on a scale, smellin burnt skin
It's dark now in Dachau and I'm screamin from within
'Cause I'm cell locked in the doctrines of the right
Enslaved by dogma, talk about my birthrights
Yet at every turn I'm runnin into hell's gates
So I grip the cannon like Fanon and pass the shells to my classmates...
...
(Aw, power to the peopleeee~!)
The bosses right to live is mine to die
So I'm goin out heavy sorta like Mount Tai
With the five centuries of penitentiary so let the guilty hang
in the year of tha boomerang!

[Chours]
(I got no property, but yo I'm a piece of it..)
So let the guilty hang
(I got no property, but yo I'm a piece of it..)
In the year of tha boomerang!
(I got no property but yo I'm a piece of it..)
So let the guilty hang
(I got no property but yo I'm a PIECE of it..)
In the year of tha boomerang!

YEAH!
NOW, IT'S, UPON, YOU!!!
NOW, IT'S, UPON, YOU!!!
