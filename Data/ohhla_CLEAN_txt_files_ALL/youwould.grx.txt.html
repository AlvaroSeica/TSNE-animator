Soccer, Soccer, Soccer
Soccer, Soccer, Soccer
Soccer, Soccer, Soccer
Soccer, Soccer, Soccer
Soccer, Soccer, Soccer
Soccer, Soccer, Soccer
Soccer, Soccer, Soccer, Soccer

You would give me kiss if I were on soccer team

Soccer, Soccer, Soccer
Soccer, Soccer, Soccer
Soccer, Soccer, Soccer
Soccer, Soccer, Soccer
Soccer, Soccer, Soccer, Soccer

Yes, You would give me kiss if I were on the soccer team
I know this because you are girlfriend of Rasheem
If I had a jersey with my number on the back
Then you would be my girlfriend and you would give me smack

When I did a telephone call you'd call me back
You would take me for a ride in your Cadillac
You would give me milk, to go with my Apple Jack
But you don't.  This hurt Hashmere like a thumb tack

I play chess, but you don't care
still like soccer player with his very long hair
And I ask for half a candy-cane you would not share
This made me mad like a big grizzly bear!

Every time I try out for team I get chopped
Coach says to me: "Hashmeer you need to stop"
No I do not care, and I keep on trying because I think
You would give me kiss if I were on soccer team

Soccer, Soccer, Soccer
Soccer, Soccer, Soccer
Soccer, Soccer, Soccer
Soccer, Soccer, Soccer


You would give me kiss if I were on soccer team
Know what I mean? Know what I mean?

Soccer, Soccer, Soccer
Soccer, Soccer, Soccer
Soccer, Soccer, Soccer
Soccer, Soccer

You would give me kiss if I were on soccer team
Know what I mean? Know what I mean?

I like to paint, and I like to draw
But that don't contemplate I do not kick a soccer ball
You dont even say "Hi" when you see me in the hall
Tried to give you kiss but you push me and I fall
If I wore the Umbreds and a pair of cleats
You would want to do a sex on the bed sheets

Then we would go out and get a bite to eat
We would have a sandwich with lett-u-iss and meat
Then we'd go back home and watch Jerry Letterman
I know you like Rasheem but Hashmere's the better man
He might be good at soccer but I think he's too mean
You would give me kiss if I were on soccer team!

Soccer, Soccer, Soccer
Soccer, Soccer, Soccer
Soccer, Soccer, Soccer
Soccer, Soccer

You would give me kiss if I were on soccer team
Know what I mean? Know what I mean?

Soccer, Soccer, Soccer
Soccer, Soccer, Soccer
Soccer, Soccer, Soccer
Soccer, Soccer, Soccer

You would give me kiss if I were on soccer team
Know what I mean? Know what I mean?

For two weeks, practice night and day
But I'm still not good enough for the portion that we play
Guess what I discover while I'm at the Jiffy Lube?
Hashmere is very good at Rubik's Cube

I can separate white and red from the green
I will chop a pony and slightly give you lean
And yet, I am better at the Rubik's Cube than James Dean
And I am better at the Rubik's Cube than Charlie Sheen
If my pants be dirty I wash them and they're clean

Could have been my queen
I could have been your king
But now all women want to date this mean machine
I don't need you bitch, I'm on the Rubik's Cube team!!!

Rubik's, Rubik's, Rubik's
Rubik's, Rubik's, Rubik's
Rubik's, Rubik's, Rubik's
Rubik's, Rubik's

I don't need you and I don't need your soccer team
'Cause now bitch I'm on the Rubik's Cube team
Know what I mean? Know what I mean?

Rubik's, Rubik's, Rubik's
Rubik's, Rubik's, Rubik's
Rubik's, Rubik's, Rubik's
Rubik's, Rubik's

I don't need you bitch or your soccer team
Know what I mean? Know what I mean?</pre>
