[Chorus]
I told her, you should go on, it's better that way
I wish I could come with you, but I gotta stay
But I gotta stay
But I gotta stay

[Big K.R.I.T.]
All aboard, I heard 'em call your name
I knew you got your ticket, now you on your way
And it was hard to watch you wave goodbye
I'll write you here and there with no need to reply
It's just I lost a good friend in a time of need
Like forever would be better, but this time you're free
Hate you left us, kind of selfish just to think that way
You going home, don't worry, what you probably would say
But yeah it hurts, but I smile at the thought
you at peace in your mind, no longer ache in your heart
Finish your story, rise with the sun
Finally to hear your father say, servant we're done
I strive to be half of what you was
I'm just hoping that I can carry on your love
And I regret all the times I had to leave you
I promise I'ma see you when I see you

[Chorus]

[Big K.R.I.T.]
Yo, your motherly hands used to usher Sunday mornings
Played the tambourine so well
Reminiscing on my granddaddy
Shed tears as you looked at his pictures on the shelf
Phone ringing every day, friends gone away
Wishing you could go, but you had to stay
I sit and cry with you, soon the feelings up and pass
Aware one day that you'd pack your bags
Turned to me and asked, don't fret when I leave
This earthly body of mine done did all of its deeds
Crawled till it walked and held all it could breathe
Carry on what I taught, you was given through He
to you, from me, in times like this believe
I got a call like you used to get just the other day
They told me you'd gone home to stay

[Chorus]

[Big K.R.I.T. - singing]
Now I know what you meant when you used to sing
If I had wings, wings, wings
I'd fly away, I'd fly away
Lord, if I had wings, wings, wings
I'd fly away, I'd fly away
