[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
(You better be easy) You gotta take your time to get what you want from me shorty
(Baby be easy) I'm a need a little more if your tryin to run your game on me
(Oooh baby be easy) You better take what you could get cause right now I'm all messed up shorty
(You better be easy) It's gonna take all you got oh baby
(Take your time and fall back easy)

[Verse 1: Hot Rod]
Nigga lean to the back be easy jack
Get cheese off of tracks twenty three's on Lac
Now, new day new timbos, new day new bimbos
Roll up that window, gimme that indo
I only pimp the ones who wanna be pimped though
Ask hoes sometime I'm a man that's gentle
Two hoes shit that's a menagetrois
Got that tongue on mt thing they goin la la la
I ain't trick no bread only dimes when I had 'em
I ain't had no gun when I was poppin at 'em
Fifth cop the Phantom and I hopped in the Phantom
And they ain't hopped in the Phantom, man they hopped in they Saturn
Man they actin all hard all mean and macho
I'm burnin these chips so this cheese is nachos
So get yo' ass to the rear matter of fact
G-G-G-G-G-G-Get yo' ass outta here nigga!

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
(You better be easy) You gotta take your time to get what you want from me shorty
(Baby be easy) I'm a need a little more if your tryin to run your game on me
(Oooh baby be easy) You better take what you could get cause right now I'm all messed up shorty
(You better be easy) It's gonna take all you got oh baby
(Take your time and fall back easy)

[Verse 2: Hot Rod]
Now I changed this hoe she was actin all bouji
Showed a little bit of swag she end up in the 'cuzzi
Little time passed she was givin the booty
First time I met her she was callin me mooley
Chill with me mama I'm a get the nana
Ask for that Prada you 'gon end up with nada
Creep me up in your teepee call me papa
Cause you know that D is supreme like Dada
I don't be up in the club doin the cha cha
Cute girl asked me if she cute I'm like uh uh
Now that's game now I hope y'all listen
Cause everybody say she was cute me I'm different
It ain't my fault that you's a lame
Nine six you was broke O Six is the same
And you mad cause I'm hot with a little bit of fame
And your chick sprung off me sort of like T-Pain

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
(You better be easy) You gotta take your time to get what you want from me shorty
(Baby be easy) I'm a need a little more if your tryin to run your game on me
(Oooh baby be easy) You better take what you could get cause right now I'm all messed up shorty
(You better be easy) It's gonna take all you got oh baby
(Take your time and fall back easy)</pre>
