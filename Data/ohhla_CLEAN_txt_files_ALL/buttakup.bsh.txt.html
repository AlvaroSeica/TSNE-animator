Typed by: Wammy Giveaway

Chorus: J. Lacey
She got a caramel round, round, brown
Make me go crazy, when she come around
Baby is my buttercup, oooh, I got a sweet tooth
Baby is my buttercup, oooh, I got a sweet tooth
And she got them skinny jeans buttoned down low
She's my favorite candy, got to let her know
Baby is my buttercup, oooh, I got a sweet tooth
Baby is my buttercup, oooh, I got a sweet tooth

[Baby Bash]
(Verse 1)
Yeah, you bustin' out your label, girl, you bustin' all night
Body top notch, top rank and top flight
But it ain't a Butterfinger or it ain't a Babe Ruth
Got you dancin' way loose, like you off the Grey Goose
(???) on my mind, caramel frappucino
Betty Crocker, Dunkin Hines, cakes like Rio
Her body so frio, colder than Alaska
Break me off slow, she gon' break me off faster
And you know she broke me off from the south to the north
East to the west where the booty so soft
Got me singing woy-yoy, woy-yoy
She got that goody gum, gum, oh boy

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 2)
Less filling, tastes great, that's my thang
Honey buns, dum dums, coconut cream
Cut her up clean, cause she sweeter than my swisha
I get a cavity, every time I gets with her
She my Cover Girl, lover girl, sweet as amaretto
Lookin' some vicious, when she do it in stilettos
Hip hop or heavy metal, she workin' that Jell-O
And she love to bring it home and help me count mas dinero
Hersey Kisses from my Lady Godiva
I ain't got a sqaure belle, I gots me a rider
Put her on your flyer, bet your club jump off right
Guaranteed, she gon' keep it bumpin' all night

Repeat Chorus

Hook: J. Lacey
A top notch lady make the club go crazy
Let me see your goody-goody gum drop
Thicker than a Snicker with a body off the ricther
Let me see your goody-goody gum drop
If you sexy and you know it
Not afraid to show it
Let me see your goody-goody gum drop
And if your frame off the chain
Make 'em say "Mayne"
Let me see your goody-goody gum drop

Repeat Chorus

[Baby Bash {Baby Bash *slowed down*}]
{Awready...
DJ, hook it up like a tow truck
DJ, hook it up like a tow truck
DJ, hook it up like a tow truck
Ha ha}
La-lace 'em up
