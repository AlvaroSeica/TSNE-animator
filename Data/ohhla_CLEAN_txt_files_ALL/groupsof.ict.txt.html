[Intro: Quotes from Wu-Tang Clan - Bring Da Ruckus]
I roll with groups of ghetto bastards ---------&gt; Inspectah Deck
I roll with groups of ghetto bastards ---------&gt; Inspectah Deck
I roll with groups of ghetto bastards ---------&gt; Inspectah Deck
I roll with groups of ghetto bastards ---------&gt; Inspectah Deck

[Verse One: L.P.]
Since the days of an embryo, I knew something wasn't Cooperstetic
Premature, and mamas was a diabetic
The Paramedics gave her the statics; to stop her screaming
Not even borned, already dreaming
Fiending for the outside, but damn they didn't make it
Pops broke out, cause mama is pregnant, he couldn't take it (NO!)
I wiggled my way out through somehow
Six weeks in the oxygen mask, suffering succotash
Outcast by the rest, but I don't give a fuck
Barely in the sixth grade, already fucking up
In school, on the streets, nine strapped for the enemy
Rolling with a group of ghetto bastards as bad as me
That's how I hung out, got sprung out on a Four old bottle
Tape deck, Snoop Doggy Dogg became my new Role Model
Slang for the hustle, bang for the group
Born to be wild, now let me tell you what I do

[Chorus: Quotes from Wu-Tang Clan - Bring Da Ruckus]
I roll with groups of ghetto bastards ---------&gt; Inspectah Deck
I roll with groups of ghetto bastards ---------&gt; Inspectah Deck
I roll with groups of ghetto bastards ---------&gt; Inspectah Deck
I roll with groups of ghetto bastards ---------&gt; Inspectah Deck

[Verse Two: Ice-T]
Niggaz I be rolling with don't care about much
Niggaz I be rolling with be quick to loose touch
They'll cut you up in a second, out reckoned, they got no chain
And grown up with mams, but no dads for explain
And so they tamed to the street and learnt to eat raw meet
Live the night, life is strife, and quick to kill with the knife
Before gun uhh.. that shit don't matter to them nothing
Sometimes they roll out; for drama and the gun blazes fun
So.. jack me, nigga and I'll jack you back
I got an Army full of niggaz high of Chronic and gnac
And they're all Street down, love to beat down
A sucker talking out their neck and made me lick to catch wreck
They got warrants, parole tales, some jumped bails
I even got a couple of niggaz straight escaped from jail
But they're motherfucking niggaz and I love them to death
And they're ones that come to see you, when you play me left

[Chorus: Quotes from Wu-Tang Clan - Bring Da Ruckus]
I roll with groups of ghetto bastards ---------&gt; Inspectah Deck
Them niggaz checking raper, regulating in the dark -----&gt; Ice-T
I roll with groups of ghetto bastards ---------&gt; Inspectah Deck

[Verse Three: L.P.]
Now when it comes to rolling solo, I don't give a damn
Cause any time; I'm with my boys I be the trigger man
Understand - for what it's worth, that I live hell on earth
Shotgun out of the stick hood, I've never learnt to surf
It was just me and my homies from the springs to the winters
Ending out the Juvenile Hall, detention sinners
Doing shit, ain't got no business doing
Til we left the GTAs, plus evading cops pursuing
Never had a chance to have a real male figure
Nineteen year old Bad-ass little nigga
No one to help me but that demon on my shoulder
Keeping me high, got me shadowboxing boulders (UHH!)
Fists pour blood, tears roll in the cheeks
Mad cause I've never had a real family
Back to reality though, my boys be my real peeps (Yeah!)
So niggaz watch that ass, cause when I rolls, I rolls deep
And uhh..

[Chorus: Quotes from Wu-Tang Clan - Bring Da Ruckus]
I roll with groups of ghetto bastards ---------&gt; Inspectah Deck
I roll with groups of ghetto bastards ---------&gt; Inspectah Deck

[Verse Four: Ice-T]
When I was young I used to watch shows like 'Leave It to Beaver'
Wily, Freddie and Haskell, Miss Cleaver
I've looked around my environment though
And didn't see a motherfucking thing that looked near like that show (SHIT!)
Shit, my moms was dead, my pops was soon to die
And even though, I loved them dearly, yo, I did not cry
I stayed strong, and I fought from the bottom to the top with my posse
Now, a nigga is looking dope, fly, flossy
Rolex blinded niggaz from my fart
Fifty foot boat, fifteen cars
And may you make a mistake and step wrong, well nigga you won't live long
Cause all of my niggaz are known to catch wreck with chromes
Straight from South Central, fool, we ain't from Compton
Now, I'm high on that hill, I got my crew's ears popping
My same niggaz and they ain't no Marks
Them nigga checking paper, regulating in the dark

[Chorus: Quotes from Wu-Tang Clan - Bring Da Ruckus]
I roll with groups of ghetto bastards ---------&gt; Inspectah Deck
I roll with groups of ghetto bastards ---------&gt; Inspectah Deck
I roll with groups of ghetto bastards ---------&gt; Inspectah Deck
I roll with groups of ghetto bastards ---------&gt; Inspectah Deck</pre>
