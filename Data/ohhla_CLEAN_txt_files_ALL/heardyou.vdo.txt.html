Song:   Heard You
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Nigga still talking that gun shit like they shun spit nigga suck dick

[Chorus]
Heard you, streets talk and I heard you
You walk next, I heard you
First to death, I heard you
I heard you, getting money I heard you
Got roll voice, I heard you
Quarter mile I heard you
Uh! Heard you, streets talking I heard you
You walk next, I heard you
First to death, I heard you
I heard you, getting money I heard you
Got roll voice, I heard you
Quarter mile I heard you

Got back in back in the coop
We trap a trap for that loop
I'm the type to walk to any dealer shit
Give me that, that and that too
Move deep game just to spare the franks
When the rap pack was that crew
But the difference is get a round of applaud
Y'all clap clap and we shoot
I just rap facts in that boof
LV tracks sew for that too
You don't want to fuck with me with that flu
You wanna be ride smack too
Chicks looking back at you like that's who
'Cause I'm always blowin' paper at you
Yeah floss mean and shark fools
Lost in and that blue

[Chorus]
Heard you, streets talk and I heard you
You walk next, I heard you
First to death, I heard you
I heard you, getting money I heard you
Got roll voice, I heard you
Quarter mile I heard you
Uh! Heard you, streets talking I heard you
You walk next, I heard you
First to death, I heard you
I heard you, getting money I heard you
Got roll voice, I heard you
Quarter mile I heard you

Uh, Verse 2
Giving me the word and I'm merk two
Down to '95 with them birds flew
I'm 101 25 with no curfew
You on 12 o'clock, movin' on and you can sell the rocks
I'm in the blue feltin hotel alive
The lil' diamond with the nails on top
You can smell the pie, a big L I'm a stack weed in it
Always quit to go play the block, I'll be big L and max in it
Keep the 40 AK and glock
If I ain't feelin' well than I am squeezin' it
Play the crib every day it's hot
But once the party is empty been reading it

[Chorus]

En mi caso be I can't even see
Trap house tell me where the [?] believe
Top on, top down, that's you [?]
Come to the plug try to maximize
On Twitter and them birds in the middle of the town
Tryin' to [?] in the middle of the house
In the living room tryin' to [?] my nigga
Don't play got choppers on the couch my nigga
I'm a hit her, I'm a boss, I ain't never do across
[?] to the niggas that I fuck with
Caught the mile on accumulate hundreds on the MP I'm on some floss shit
You'll be on some floss shit, causing up the shit waiting for to do that
I'll chase a pussy, a p**sy wait nigga boy I already knew that

[Chorus]</pre>
