Yeah, fuck y'all.
Yo.

[Verse One]
Rap assassin, catch me in trenchcoat flashing
Son of law, hate the Jake with a passion
Control the street, hold heat, roll the leaf, flossing teeth
Extraordinaire, thousanair flare prepare
Lying there eat ya beef rare, we treat ya scare
Prepare for the Wildcat, stare down pet, forever foul rap
Malik spit the filthiest poetry
Leave heads dead for just the dose in me dunn
You ain't supposed to be, posing a threat
I leave ya clothes wet
Daily ashes shit sniffed could get ya nose wrecked
The labre gaining fast lader smokin in gaschambers
Melt ya ice rap flamer, lion tamer
Now let me conquer, I eat the drama like a school of piranha
Tuff as tonquer, and die for my honor
Kamikaze bomber that defy any persona
I let your fire blunt choke emcees, like Erick Onasis
I'm on it heavy, fast daddy pushing a Chevy
Up the turnpike, play Heads Betty, burning the mic
Sweaty dick, converted dyke, murdered for spike
Street dirty type, sticky move murky tonight
Some Magnetic Allah, 1988 for figger heavy weight
Drop today's date, rocking ya state
Boulevard bully, squirt cats with the fully
Seven and a half thousands of ref under my hat shiiiit

[Hook] [2x]
Extravagant, arrogant
Extraordinair, tabernaire
No fear, we rocking the square
Wildcats taking over this year
Thousanair flare Dynasty the b-boy pair

[Verse Two]
Yo check my trifle recitals
Grab ya Korans, ya Bibles and tourists
For the vital info, the pimp flow
Original Mack smacks truly in the Mackadocious
God should strip exposes with dream to test the rovers
Yo, picture me manoeuvering through wild New York just cruising it
Shift to the F-T-R, I'm set to spar
The likes of Mario with Dreaddy in the next All Star
We don't spark pah, Allah don't like ugly
Yo, the belly full but me always hungry
Never settling, mah switch mah A-packs, break like latex
Ya Avirex jackin rockin niggaz come down by dozens, yo cousin
(Whatup son) You gets the best of my love, don't budge
I see a nigga tryna plot out ya steps, plan his attack
He did it just to get a rep
Let's smoove with vigor, feel the effects of the liquor
Straight up with no chaser make the high come quicker
Damn! You know what happens when the shit takes over, I lose control
We can't let this nigga slide, besides
Let's do the track until it dies like Bedstuy
Brooklyn crooked thoughts roam through my third eye
Twist the lye, grab the mic to testify, justify the ends
My army's Afreem, Kareem Abdul Jabbar, Hakeem Olajuwon
??? or post, we rocks the fly shit the most.

[Hook] [2x]
Extravagant, arrogant
Extraordinair, tabernaire
No fear, we rocking the square
