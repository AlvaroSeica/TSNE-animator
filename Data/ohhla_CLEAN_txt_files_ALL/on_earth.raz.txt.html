[Darnell McClain]
I hear people saying, they're waiting for the Hearafter
And making it to Heaven is the only thing that matters
I got Heaven right here on Earth

[Hell Razah]
On Earth as it is in Heaven
Where you headed after Armageddon?
But David Gef' is playing Dreamworks
Bury my spirit in the universe
From the word of God into a verse
Through an immaculate virgin birth
What's the lowest price a person's worth?
He sold his soul for the perfect curse
What you searching for in every Church?
Look in yourself you can find it first
We can't take our wealth into a hearse
It's even worst to see the children hurt
The devil smirk after another killing
Beneath the Earth ceiling
May all the feeling, the pain, become a joyful healing
Eternal happiness, forever lasting life
Shining primordial light, by universal right
Immortal God head on my celestial body
Extra terrestrial thieves, sons of Illuminati

[Darnell McClain]
I got Heaven right here on Earth

[Hell Razah]
If I ain't got nuttin' I know they ain't got me
But still I ain't cocky
And my father houses many mansions
On the roof of the world you see the stars dancing
Look at the sun smiling, the beauty of the moon
I'm in the Upper Room
Zooming on Neptune, writing in next June

[Darnell McClain]
I think about it all in retrospect
Feel it passed sky to my neck
And I'm still wondering why, it's like we all expect
When we need our debt to get a reward
I know I think about it's all worthless
Going through this life and never find your purpose
In this Hell and trying to do it on this surface
And it got me nervous
And I'm screaming out WHYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!??!!
When there isn't a soul that missed the real time
Oh Lord WHYYYYYYYYYY!!!!????!!!
It's more then just waiting for him to crack the sky
I've realized I got Heaven right here on Earth

(Timbo talking)
Yeah
I'm a roll an olive tree to this, man
Sit back and watch it grow
Yeah
It's Heaven on Earth
Let's send this one to the farmers
You know?
Ok

[Timbo King]
And yeah, icon statue when I'm looking right at you
Laws and commandments, many wars plus famine
Heaven on Earth, you know sheeps' come first
This that feast of the Church
Baptized since birth
Matthew, chapter 5, 3rd verse
You can search for the truth
The proof within the fruits
All childrens' of the ghetto turned pharaohs and kings
The smell of frankincense in the air
Spring, I'm your heavenly host
Let's merrily toast
To the meek and the humble that inherits the most
I repent, I rebut, the preacher man suit
A saint like Luke when I'm up against the duke
Gospel army of the Lord
Knocking on Heavens door
Glory, hallelujah, the devil try to fool ya
The vessel, the bloodline, we children of the Most High
The Most High

See you going through a lot right now as a people
No'm'sain? We need some inspiration
Some that's gon' inspire us man
The music is a tool
So that's why when I was making this album
Just had to sit down and really really think about what I was gon' give to you
I wanted to open up your spirit
I wanna return your spirit to back to God, no'm'sain?
I'm a messenger of God, what I come to say and deliver
I feel is important, I got something add to hip-hop
Everybody just wanna get into hip-hop and do the same thing
But what you gotta bring to the table in the end of the day?
Is you gon' make history?
You look around you man, and you think about it?
You think about what's gon' happen to you
2012 is the world gon' end?
What's gon' happen to the babies, huh?
24 Elders, archangels, we gon' open up the Ark of the Covenant</pre>
