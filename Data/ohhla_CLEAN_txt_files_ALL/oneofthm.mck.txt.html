Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus 1]
It's just one of them days
Yeah ma, I ain't tryina be all alone
Ha, I'm just tryina be with you baby girl all day
Like 24/7, 365, yeah
It's just one of them days
Yeah, and I'm just feeling like getting with my baby
It's just one of them days
Today I'm not tryina be in the studio
I'm just tryina be with my baby
It's just one of them days
You know when I need love
Every nigga that's real need a hug
It's just one of them days
Huh, we might sex all day
We might sex all night
It's just one of them days

[Verse 1]
I'm just tryina relieve stress
You know when I'm sad I know your womb is the best
It's just so wet, see I protect
You from the world, that's right you really my girl
We could be like Mickey, or be like Mallory
Even if I didn't have money lost salary
I know you'd prolly be next to me
Ride in the Lex with me
Or ride on the bus with me
You probably just fuss with me
I fight with the laws, I fight with your paws
I know you cat fighting baby
But you still are my dog
And I won't never call you a bitch
But if I do, understand that it's just

[Chorus 2]
It's just one of them days
Hah, when I might be trippin
Like a man baby girl I ain't slippin
It's just one of them days
I might say but I don't mean
But you know I'm a cool dude
You know I ain't mean
It's just one of them days
But the world fucking with me
But I'm still fucking with you
And you're fucking with me
It's just one of them days
And I wanna be with you
All I wanna do is see you
It's just one of them days

[Verse 2]
When I wish that we could chill
Maybe go to the park and have a little picnic
Go to the art gallery
I already told you that we Mickey and you Mallory
Now we Bonnie and Clyde every time that we ride
Know that you be ready to come every time I'm inside
I let you bust 3 before I bust one
If a nigga disrespect I might have to bust 1
Plus 49, right up in this frame
And I love your frame
See on my frame, me on your frame
You know you got my name and all on my frame
I might get your name

[Chorus 3]
It's just one of them days
And I'm feelin real good
When I see you with your scarf on you're feeling real hood
It's just one of them days
And you might be on your period
And I just lay back, I ain't really getting serious
It's just one of them days
And I wanna be with you
Since my plan A is you
I wanna see you
It's just one of them days...
Ha oh you went to DU, ha I might ask to see just keep you uh
It's just one of them days</pre>
