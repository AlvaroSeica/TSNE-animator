[Zack de la Rocha]
A jail cell is freedom...from the pain in my home...
Hatred passed on...passed on and passed on...
A world of violent rage...but it's one that I can recognize..
Having never seen the color of my father's eyes...
Yes, I dwell in hell...but it's a hell that I can grip...
I tried to grip my family...but I slipped!
To escape from the pain...in an existence mundane
I got a nine, a sign, a set, and now I got a name!!!

READ MY WRITING ON THE WALL
NO ONE'S HERE TO CATCH ME, WHEN I FALL!
DEATH IS ON MY SIDE...
SUICIIIIIIIIIIIIIIDE!!!

A jail cell is freedom...from the pain in my home...
Hatred passed on...passed on and passed on...
A world of violent rage...but it's one that I can recognize..
Having never seen the color of my father's eyes...
Yes, I dwell in hell...but it's a hell that I can grip!
I tried to grip my family...but I slipped!
To escape from the pain...in an existence mundane
I got a nine, a sign, a set, and NOW I GOT A NAME!!!

READ MY WRITING ON THE WALL!!!
NO ONE'S HERE TO CATCH ME, WHEN I FALL!!
CAUGHT BETWEEN MY CULTURE AND THE SYSTEM...
GENOCIIIIIIIIIDE!!!!

READ MY WRITING ON THE WALL!!!
NO ONE'S HERE TO CATCH ME, WHEN I FALL!!
IF IGNORANCE IS BLISS...
THEN KNOCK THE SMILE OFF MY FACE!!
YEAAAAAH!!!

[*Instrumental break*]

If we don't take action now...
We settle for nothing later...
Settle for nothing now...
And we'll settle for nothing later...

If we don't take action now..
We settle for nothing later..
We'll settle for nothing now!
And we'll settle for nothing later!!

IF WE DON'T TAKE ACTION NOW...
WE'LL SETTLE FOR NOTHING LATER...
WE'LL SETTLE FOR NOTHING NOW...
AND WE'LL SETTLE FOR NOTHING LATER...

IF WE DON'T TAKE ACTION NOW...
WE'LL SETTLE FOR NOTHING LATER...
WE'LL SETTLE FOR NOTHING NOW...
AND WE'LL SETTLE FOR NOTHING LATERRRR...</pre>
