[Chorus]
They digging me, look at everybody digging me (digging me)
They digging me, look at everybody digging me (digging me)
Digging me, look at everybody digging me (diggin me)
They digging me, look at everybody digging me (digging me)

[Verse 1]
I see you looking at me you wanna know whats hap'nin
Do I work dem keys, or dem P's, is just strictly rappin
Hell I live that life, now I'm livin right
You see this necklace round my neck filled with so much ice
And my pockets fat, like I got the mumps
Until you haters Come On try and play like I'm a chump
We got them killas on our team, and they ready the dump
I hope you dig that, cause this is ain't where its at
Just keep a gangsta and help a playa spin up deez stacks
Cause dat beef shit, (nigga) you don't want dat
We fifty deep wit dem 2's, everywhere we at
So you best to check a ho and, nigga and try and fuck dat

[Chorus]
They digging me, look at everybody digging me (digging me)
They digging me, look at everybody digging me (digging me)
Digging me, look at everybody digging me (diggin me)
They digging me, look at everybody digging me (digging me)

[Verse 2]
When I step in the door they notice me d4l chains so icy
Fixin ain't in my nature though that's why deez bitches like me
22 man sittin up on knocked nn the door done dropped my phone
All deez whips all on dis chrome wood droppin feelin dats too long
Everybody diggin me fuck naw they ain't no kin to me
All they do is hang around and hold they nuts they enemies
Its ok with the stuntman though déjà vu I done seen it before
Ask how low ask Fa-bo ask Mook b dey already know
Uh uh

[Verse 3]
(A-Town) It's shorty low
Look at my eyes they set, real real low
I can't lie, I'm high
You know how I flex
Ice round my neck
I'm here to impress
Lean with it, (ah) rock wit it (ah)
Bounce wit it(ah), hit the clock with it (ah)
Shit I can dig it (I can dig it )
Shit I can dig it (I can dig it)
They digging me (they diggin me)
Nigga hol' at me (hol' at me)

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
They dig the way I talk so I impress
They dig the way I walk dat boy blessed
Aint really playin with the rest
d4l tattoed over my neck
Look at the colors dey like no other
Because of the turned of the cave is bubbla
He wore the white shades never mistake
Fa-bo for another
they never gave bankhead a chance
Look at Checky's sundance
girls going crazy fallin out
Lord blessed the fans
We playin baseball in the stands
Hittin homeruns every time I can
Two times to the left with the ATL band
Two times to the right if you dig me man
