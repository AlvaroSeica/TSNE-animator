Song:   The Vulture
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Standing in the ruins
Of another Black man's life
or flying through the valley
They're separating day and night
"I am death," cried the Vulture
"For the people of the light."

Charon brought his raft
and came from the sea that sails on souls
And saw the scavenger departing
taking warm hearts to the cold
He knew the ghetto was the haven
for the meanest creature ever known

In a wilderness of heartbreak
and a desert of despair
Evil's carrion of justice
shrieks a cry of naked terror
He's taking babies from their momas
and leaving grief beyond compare

So if you see the Vulture coming
he's flying circles in your mind
Remember there is no escaping
for he will follow close behind
Only promised me a battle
battle for your soul and mine

He taking babies from their momas
And he's leaving
Leaving
Leaving
Leaving
Leaving</pre>
