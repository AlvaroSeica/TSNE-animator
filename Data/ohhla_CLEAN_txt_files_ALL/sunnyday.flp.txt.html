(Hook:Big Shasta)
we rollin on chrome
flossin its a sunny day
niggas smokin blunts
blowin light green hay
all about our cash
we worked hard and got paid
stacks mutiplied now its
time to parlay

(Lil'Flip)
its a sunny day so I'm a pull out the drop
no chain today but I'm a pull out the watch
you know I'm iced out (bling!)lookin like a wedding cake
I hear niggas whisperin man I bet its fake
But I got cash ride around in drop Jags
with my top back interior all black
With leather seats rimmed up 4 times
I'm in the V-12 watch me blow down
you know me I gotta put my stunt down 
and when the laws pass by I put my blunt down
cause I stay high like a telophone pole
And I roll on vogues and pimp yellow bone hoes
Swangas and blades is what we sit on
I'm talking on my "flip phone", ya get it "flip phone"
Smokin on a zone of that  sticky-icky-green
Hoes see me in the Jag and say "Flip thinks he clean..."

(Lil'Flip)
I'm at the beach party in a pearl white drop
I had to take my bracelet off cause the girls might bop
white Airforce ones Fat Albert tank top Nike head band
long braids hang out hoes everywhere man its goin down
the traffics so bad cops sayin turn around
but you know niggas we gonna try to sneak in 
some niggas going broke tryna ball this weekend
and TJ takin flicks wit bad broads, Hump in the Benz
Redd in the Jaguar, we leaned out you know 
our car screened out and if we aint ridin 20s
we chrome 19ed out 84s got me shinin in the lane
we been ridin blades stop stealin our slang!
you know what we really ballin down south and all
niggas jammin Screw and Swisha House...

(Hook:Big Shasta rp2x)

{Lil'Flip}

{Big Shasta breakdown}
we rollin on chrome
(rollin on chrome)
and we looking good
(you know we lookin good)
grippin on wood...
its a sunny day in the hood!

(Lil'Flip)
you see them 20s spinnin when I'm swangin down the strip
Diamonds hanging off my lip, my trunk bangin like a crip
niggas thinkin I'ma slip but I cain't
If a hater try to jack I'm a waste 'em like drank
I'm ridin on a full tank, switchin lanes like Maurice
Baguettes on my teeth, maurcetts on my teeth
Iceberg on my feet, the Speedy Gonzales
Big Mar, &amp; Big Hawk yea them my compadres
we ball everyday like Catino Mobley
I gotta Cartier but have you seen my Roley
I ride Navigator its my Navigator
I feel like Tela "bound by haters"as I
slide by Jaimiaca sippin medicine
we wanna bring our cups in but they wont
let us in so we hit cornbreads and go back
to the house I'm a hold it down for Screw
know what I'm talking bout!...
