[Intro: Dom Pachino]
Dom Pachino, Golden Child

[Chorus: Golden Child in Spanish]

[Dom Pachino]
I know she like thugs, I can see it in her eyes
She came with that clown, but she wanna change sides
Could it be my jewels, or my luxury ride
It might be beard, cuz I dress kinda fly
I got a girl, but I want a slice of the pie
Temptation's a bitch, and I know she wanna try
Damn, mami, you got a mean set of thighs
And a set of lips, that'll suck a man dry
I'mm slip you my number, just make sure you call
If my girl picks up, you my cousin, that's all
I got a nice condo, right next to the mall
And I'm sitting sideways like my name was Paul Wall
One night with me and that clown won't exist
You ain't living life, if you don't take a risk
Dame besos, girl, give me a kiss
It's whatever you want, I'll grant you a wish

[Chorus]

[Hook: Golden Child in Spanish]

[Dom Pachino]
Girl, slide with me, baby girl, take a ride with me
One night is like eternity
Your man's not a concern to me
For certainly, he don't no problem with P
I got big plans for you and me
Like blue skies and white sands in the West Indies
Look in my eyes girl, can't you see
The chemisty is hot, like a hundred degrees

[Chorus]</pre>
