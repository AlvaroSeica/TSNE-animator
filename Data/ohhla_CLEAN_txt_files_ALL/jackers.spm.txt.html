(Verse 1)
They wipe tears, while I wipe fingerprints off lead
They say shoot for the stars, I say shoot for the head
I beleave in good times having peace and fun
But im still in my room, tryna grease my gun
Can't let it get rusty, if it shoot I breaks
The only thing I want jammin is my screwed out tape
And tomorrow is a big day, gotta get my rest
Forty five "G's" out of town, link by a tres
I'm all alone, my girl said that she couldn't make it
Cuz she caught a damn cold, and her whole body is achin
And I feel kinda nervous, butterflies in my stomach
But I drift off to sleep, really thinkin nothin of it
Then something wakes me up, and I open my eyes
Somebody is in my house, I'm heartbroken cuz I
Couldn't tell my mom bye
They finally cought me slippin'
I'ma die like a man, homeboy I ain't trippin'

(Chorus 2X)
Gunhsots to my dome, jackers in my home
Nothin' too fancy just your average tombstone
I'm sorry that I choose the life under the cursed
I'll be dressed in a suit, finally going to church

(Verse 2)
Dreams of the cream, enemies on different teams
Red beams in my house, man this shit is so extreme
I saw 'em dressed up in all black, with the mask
And knew I they was comin' for the birds and the cash
So I rolled out my bed, hit the floor and stared crawlin
And this is the price you gotta pay when you ballin
But how did they get the spare key to my crib
It had to be my bitch, she gon' die if I live
Usually I keep a black glock on my dresser
And I'm hearin someone whisper sayin, "Los ima get you"
And I know is the devil but I pay it no mind
But i've been dodging that fool ever since I was nine
Gotta make it to the closet, where I keep my mossberg
Slug shots, one hit, never speak another word
Little did I know they had night vision googles
When they saw me on the floor, boys squeezed on the throttle

(Chorus 2X)
Gunhsots to my dome, jackers in my home
Nothin' too fancy just your average tombstone
I'm sorry that I choose the life under the cursed
I'll be dressed in a suit, finally going to church

(Verse 3)
Shots started ringin' I was tumblin and diving
Running out of time with my mind on surviving
Dove out the window, but I started seeing stars
I forgot last week bought some burglar bars
Now my face is all wet, and I know it ain't sweat
Bullet hit my leg, so I rolled to my left
Guess where I was at? Damn right in the closet
Grabbed the pump, now it's my turn to make a deposit
Damn slugs ain't no punk, hit the boy in his back
Saw his right leg flying, and it knocked down my lamp
Unloaded, reloaded, it was a three men army
Now they looking like they got us at the end of a party
One was still alive, so I started asking questions
He could barely talk, spitting blood like venom
He said he had a team, and that people would rent him
I killed the messengers now I need to send him

(Chorus 2X)
Gunhsots to my dome, jackers in my home
Nothin' too fancy just your average tombstone
I'm sorry that I choose the life under the cursed
I'll be dressed in a suit, finally going to church</pre>
