[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Yes, everybody, this is something for you
That you got to hear!
And sometimes you may say to yourself, baby, I - love - you!
Yes, my dear, everything is so fly and so splendid girl
Iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii, loooooooooove, youuuuuuuuuuuu more, girl
Yeah, yeah, my sugar pie, my honey bunch
My flower, my dew dropping, my --- permanent shit stain
My, my, my girl, I said I love you so
You're my, you're my heart ---</pre>
