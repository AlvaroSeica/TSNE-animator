INTRO
[?1] Hmmm, what style do you practice?
[?2] I'm fluent in the mic technique and you
[?1] Hmm, your style's pathetic, you want a fresh style?  Let me show you

[D-Shade] {Revolution}
I'll tell you a bit about myself, and swing it with a... (verse)
My man cool play me the fool I gotta... (curse)
Grumpy with the voodoo, even though I want to hear you scream
(All of us jumping the rainbow, coming to get you out of a dream)
I'm the trippin' ripping like {this}, ripping like {that}
Trip with a hit, with a (verb bat)
And it's combined with the mind, that this series I climb
And at that old invitation, (stop to recheck the time)
But the clock {stops}, no more tick {tocks}
Did you think at least take the time to learn the leter of hip-hop
{Yeah, it's too black, cat can't play that}
But in a couple weeks he's playing all the fly tracks
And saying (hmmmmm, well anyways)
Of course he's going to play it 'cause he knows that the rhyme pays
Respect for my elders, (peers as well as women)
The only bitch I've had was my dog, and (now I'm sending)
This shoutout to (all my friends with the clout)
I mean the ones who push the ??? (to bring the orders out)
And now that I have no really care to turn back
So bring it on consignment, (yeah right black)
Listen here I come riding in with the (bass drum)
Burning all the labels giving it up on the (high strung)
Bump filled (speakers) who play the roll of (leaders)
Taking a fat chunk of the check (money bleeders)
Need to clarify (any lie that you telling me)
Rest with the ????? considered the (friendly)
To a certain extent, but if you fuss (or cuss heads gonna get buss)
'Cause respect (is a must) what do you say, what do you know
As we come (as we go, with a touch)
You know a little bit about us

CHORUS [D-Shade] {Revolution} (All)
About who, about what? {A little bit about us}
About who, about what? {A little bit about us}
About who, about what? {A little bit about us}
(And now you know about us 'cause the rhymes we bust)

[Revolution]
Ah man, I gots to get lazy on this track man
(Eh rude boy  wake up the man)
I got a fridge full of (juice), I'm ready to let loose
You're waiting to hear about us, so (listen close)
I'm coming up, I'm styling up, I hit like a (batter)
I'm badder,  (a hatter), so what's with the (chit chatter)
You're sure to hate me 'cause I'm white and I'm a (rapper)
If my last name were (Dan), my first would be (Dapper)
I'm coming on strong like Steven Seigel not (Van Damne)
I only eats meat, don't give me cheese with my (ham)
Give me a break, I'm just joking like (Seinfeld)
If I was a stand up comic, (you'd be known as Rhymfeld)
You could be my sidekick, only not the same
Um, your name (George), your partner (Kramer)
But lamer, look at these styles that I've (dropped)
In the past what a blast, as I've watched the crowd (hop)
I jumped like House of Pain or Kriss Kross but (don't mis-)
Intrepret, or get pissed 'cause you know I don't dis-
(Member) another member of the human (race)
I rock the mic like (beyond this place)
Back from the tip, I stand for peace and unity
The Choice is true to me, the beats not new to me
So sue me, or better yet blow me... (a kiss)
So, should I say I'll blow you (up like this)
Yo, I'm rocking and shocking, a harder faster than plaster
I'm saying Knowledge Reigns Supreme, (just like the Blastmaster)
Peace to black and white (is a must)
(And now you know a little about us)

CHORUS X2 [Revolution] {D-Shade} (All)

[DJ Choice]
Come back boy
Yo, as I look into the future, I realize that no one can get looser
Than me, DJ Choice, the producer
So get (used to) the style that I'm bringing 'cause it's (swinging)
And all the fly women on my tip (since the beginning)
But now I stay (focused), and you should know (this style of mine)
That I be kicking (ain't bogus)
So don't you play me like a (jerk)
'Cause to get where I'm at (took a lot of hard work)
And if you've been (seen what I've seen)
You probably end up turning out to be dope (fiend)
It was a long road to travel (travel)
'Cause when I started out I was at the bottom of the (barrel)
But now I'm in like (Flynn), and I plan to win
And try to open some doors (to let the others in)
So they can all get a taste (a taste)
'Cause I just can't stand to see (talent goto waste)
Ayo I ain't the type to wait and let time decide my fate
Before you know I might blow it, then it will be too late
So now I just have to write, rhyme night after night
And make the people lose their minds when I (grab the mic)
And hook up my sampler to make a fat (beat)
Could scratch like amad (motherfucker from the streets)
And bring back hardcore that y'all have been (waiting for)
Invading the states, come straight through the (back door)
Going 100 miles an hour, I won't fall short
And when my crew is not around, I'll be holding the (fort)
So while my homeboy (Chuck) is still (locked up)
I'll be controlling while I'm rolling over suckers like a (truck)
Making sure I'm getting paid, taking care of my living
With help from Fritz Maugile and my lawyer Steven Simmons
(So you just can't trust), gain control is so much
So watch your back and get bust, that's enough about us</pre>
