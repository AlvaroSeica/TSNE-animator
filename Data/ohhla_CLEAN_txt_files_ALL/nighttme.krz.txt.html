Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro]
You do love the nighttime
Ah yea?
Yea
It's crazy
Feels so real
It is real

[Chorus]
In the nighttime
The night is on it's way
For some reason I feel better
I'm so bored of the day
Like I know how I feel it's right
In the nighttime
It's wrong for me to feel this way

[Verse 1]
So excuse me if it's weird
When it's dark some people fear it
I go near it, I can feel it
The sun just fell and I know this feeling well
A change is taking place, my city's out of space
And I wonder who's gonna cry tonight, who's gonna get fly tonight
Get drunk, get high tonight
And who's gon die tonight?
What is waiting on the side of daytime?
Feels like it's play time

[Chorus]
In the nighttime
The night is on it's way
For some reason I feel better
I'm so bored of the day
Like I know how I feel it's right
In the nighttime
It's wrong for me to feel this way

[Verse 2]
In my head it's always nightfall
Close my eyes and then the light's off
I'm at the white love
Yea these streets still gotta beat me but the mic's off
They hollerin Kali baby, put your arms round me baby
And show me what's it made for
I like the sunshine
But I love the moonlight
The freaks come out at night
The darkness is the right time
For us to do what we do

[Chorus]
In the nighttime
The night is on it's way
For some reason I feel better
I'm so bored of the day
Like I know how I feel it's right

It's crazy
Don't know why I feel this way
In the nighttime
It's crazy
In the nighttime</pre>
