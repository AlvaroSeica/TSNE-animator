what you know about this (surprise attack)
freedom fighters, black fists, we're striking
omni's in the house, he's got my back
so step the fuck back, just step the fuck back

what you know about this (surprise attack)
freedom fighters, black fists, we're striking
grasshoppers in the house, he's got my back
so step the fuck back, just step the fuck back

why you holding on my nuts like a hubcap
every five minutes asking where the bud at
you can take a puff but when you pass my bud back
step the fuck back, step the fuck back

why you holding on my nuts like a hubcap
every five minutes asking where the bud at
you can take a puff but when you pass my bud back
step the fuck back, step the fuck back

I'm a rolling stone, some one no one knows
don't move too fast, don't play me close
save your pager codes, please I'm available
relax, take a shot of jack and twist your bottle cap
I wasn't always accepted, I was often neglected
left me with the time to sharpen my soul, my skill got perfected
I'm sick, I see it and sketch it, my brains infected, I flip
the record and mix the message in 60 seconds
word to beat, edge of your seat, unexpected
fresh shit, another one to add to my collective
there's nothing you can tell me, im wealthy
I got another healthy lp, to help you help me

what you know about this (surprise attack)
freedom fighters, black fists, we're striking
grasshopper in the house, he's got my back
so step the fuck back, just step the fuck back

what you know about this (surprise attack)
freedom fighters, black fists, we're striking
mc mell'o in the house, he's got my back
so step the fuck back, just step the fuck back

I'm sick and tired of the b.s
roll with the realest
motor on my shoulder, enough weight on my chest
------
finish, regress
the most high's got my back so nobody can touch
before I die, --
hold up on many, I got plenty more shit to spit
now that I'm in it.
fit to concrete, confirm don't ------
you can make a cause, you got one choice that ------
sit in the night, write rhymes in ----
convert my thoughts to speech.
my enemy is far from a frenemy
I have to defeat, I stand strong not weak.
aint skin and no teeth
it aint sweet
to be filling up heads with ------
real hip hops the truth, that the youths aint feed
but when feeding them dessert, watching them go bizzurk
loading them with dessert, the dirt, nuff said

what you know about this (surprise attack)
freedom fighters, black fists, we're striking
omni's in the house, he's got my back
so step the fuck back, just step the fuck back

what you know about this (surprise attack)
freedom fighters, black fists, we're striking
mc mell'o in the house, he's got my back
SO STEP THE FUCK BACK, JUST STEP THE FUCK BACK</pre>
