[Intro: Rick Ross]
This not a mind game
But we can play them, too
Still running the streets
Cause I wanted to eat
Cause I wanted to eat
Cause I wanted to eat
But she who I wanted to see
Who I wanted to see
Who I wanted with me

[Interlude: Rick Ross]
Me against the world, me and my baby girl
Me and my baby girl
Me and my baby girl
Double R, me and you
Taking over the world
Taking over the world
Taking over the world

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Going hard was a given; the chance I wasn't given
Til I pulled right beside her, she was sitting in the Civic
Man, you was just who I was looking for
Top down, you could never overlook a boy
Big buckets, magnum bottles of that rose
On my R. Kelly, girl I'm bout that foreplay
Slow it down, speed it up, I'm just being me
Panamera has the ki's, that just the g in me
Got a crib on the water, need a bathing suit
Bond that we share so unbreakable
Here's a toast to the baddest chick in the room
This is not a mind game, but could play them, too

[Chorus: Kelly Rowland]
You don't have to play mind games
Just tell me what's yours is mine
Even when you're far away
You come back to me every time
It's just me and my babe at the end of the day
We ain't gotta play no mind games
Mind games

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
All-black double R
Me and my baby girl
Me and my baby girl
Me and my baby girl
You know I'm on the grind
So I miss you at times
All on my mind as I'm scribbling lines
I put the weed out, cause it play with my head
Turn the money down, we just laying in bed
She blowing money wild, bundles of bread
Times are priceless, it can go to your head
I think my mind blown, I barely feel my feet
I'm a hold my head high even in defeat
It's not a mind game so don't even think
Even if it was, it'd be over 'fore you blinked

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Kelly Rowland]
The sky is the limit
Let's take over the world
And everything in it
Me and my baby gonna ride to the finish
Down from beginning
Ooh what a feeling
Ooh what a feeling

[Interlude]

[Chorus]

[Outro: Kelly Rowland]
You don't have to play mind games
Just tell me what's yours is mine
