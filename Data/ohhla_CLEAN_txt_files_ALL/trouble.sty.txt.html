Verse 1 (Chris Styles):

Opens his eyes, it's time to wake up
another one of them nights dreaming 'bout the break up
where she came to him to say to him she wanna make up
and they speak the whole time but they never say much
lost in a gaze, lost in a maze
they were young and dumb, coming from the bottom, staying at the top
at the top, asked her simply, you with it? you not?
the rest is history, he know it 'cause the hands on the clock
move forward, he gotta keep going
no use in being lost in the moment, every memory disown it
move on with the day, 'cause he wanna get paid
there's dollars to be made, you told him he got what it takes
its on his mind, he'd be lying if he said he don't remember you
he's seen you do the coldest shit he ever knew you'd ever do
and he know that she know, he's getting close as ever
its on you 'cause he gon' make it, and you gon' regret it

Chorus (K-Young):

Is it really worth this struggle?
you're causing me too much trouble
I'm wondering if it's worth it
should I stay do you deserve it?
I don't wanna be apart
Don't wanna live with a broken heart
I can't let you drive me crazy, oh oh oh oh no no baby

Verse 2 (Chris Styles):

He came to change the game, couldn't let it stay the same
can't nothing hold him back no more, she wouldn't call him back no more
she started calling when she heard his song is on the radio
his mind is made up and ain't nothing that could change it though
she's leaving voice mails on his line, asks him if he's doing fine
says she miss him and she crying, she wants to kiss him one more time
he starts to listen and just think about the times
he started trippin' when he started digging all up in his mind
on the dance floor, took him to the past slowly
he just started reliving the memory in trance mode
when everything was how it used to be
he's young again, dumb again, numb and then in love again
and truthfully she don't know what she do to him
he lose it and he's back in the moment
when he snaps back out of it he's back at his home
and she's laying there in bed next to him like he's stuck in the past
when I wake up again, damn, that's why I gotta ask

Chorus (K-Young):

Is it really worth this struggle?
you're causing me too much trouble
I'm wondering if it's worth it
should I stay do you deserve it?
I don't wanna be apart
Don't wanna live with a broken heart
I can't let you drive me crazy, oh oh oh oh no no baby

Bridge (K-Young):

I try and try to understand
why you had to do me trifling
but now I'm wiser, a little bit smarter
now I realize you never gave a damn

Is it really worth this struggle?/ (I appreciate it)
you're causing me too much trouble/ 
I'm wondering if it's worth it/ (That I never waited for you to change)
should I stay do you deserve it?
I don't wanna be apart/ (I don't wanna be)
Don't wanna live with a broken heart/ (But I'm gonna be moving on)
I can't let you drive me crazy, oh oh oh oh no no baby

Is it really worth this struggle?
you're causing me too much trouble
I'm wondering if it's worth it
should I stay do you deserve it?
I don't wanna be apart
Don't wanna live with a broken heart
I can't let you drive me crazy, oh oh oh oh no no baby

Outro (K-Young):

Why you wanna bring me down?
tried your best to bring me down
wish yo ass could see me now/ (Baby Girl)
I don't give a damn 'bout what you say about me
I'm so glad I never fell in love with you</pre>
