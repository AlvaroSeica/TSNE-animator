Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro]
Most hated

[Chorus]
My team go, my team go
We the hottest in the town, let your team know
You don't wanna fuck around when them things blow
We ain't gotta break em down we let the things go

[Verse 1]
I had a few celebs fore I seen a mill
Was out the Memphis with the mack when I've seen the mill
Wasn't eating off the rap I ain't seen the mill
I knew my cars off the back, I ain't need the deal
Keep the steel on the lap, see slug nigga
No need for us to dab more than once nigga
I'm in the club, I play the back I don't front nigga
Kick you to the other side like a punk nigga
They told me a little but learned plenty
The way I rap it's clear that bottom first pennies
Shirt slimmy the Louie Vuitton worth many
I'll picture perfect Mister perfect, Kirk Henny
Wasn't working, now I work and serve many
Up in the work and cut the burn the murk any
Either roll or don't roll
Just made a hundred K on the road, no show

[Chorus]
My team go, my team go
We the hottest in the town, let your team know
You don't wanna fuck around when them things blow
We ain't gotta break em down we let them things go
My team go, my team go
Six series till they find me in that beam low
Chicks near me with it like they never seen dough
Wrist clearly litted, we're making a gleam show

[Verse 2]
Who don't floss, Hublot gloss
In the sleeve of the two piece of that Hugo Boss
Jumping the 9.11 call the new Volv Porsche
Before you can ask a question, yea that's too dope cause
Just lit the cigar, riding through Campton bumping Kendrick Lamar
My makers senses the mar, I'm doped up, think I'm hearing Jimmy Hendrix's guitar (spaced out!)
I messed off, you a safe left
Red bean on em when we play tag
I hate it when the palm nigga say swag
I'm stunting on em every day that's why he stay mad
Versace swag sack have Medusa head
Medusa head I lay em all got my shooter said
Nothing fake about me that's why my old jeweler dead
Even though they talk about me, shit I'm used to head

[Chorus]
My team go, my team go
We the hottest in the town, let your team know
You don't wanna fuck around when them things blow
We ain't gotta break em down we let them things go
My team go, my team go
Six series till they find me in that beam low
Chicks near me with it like they never seen dough
Wrist clearly litted, we're making a gleam show

[Bridge]
You hate that chopper well
Is off a lock you jail it on the block hot as hell
Front pan I'm Iron Man when the glock was hell
A lot of rastas sell, back pocket, pocket scale
And my cool jades but I ain't do rock the bells
I'm with the bricks squad like that click walker yell
The soldier knows if you don't like that sour smell
I burn my building down same way the towers fell

[Chorus]
My team go, my team go
We the hottest in the town, let your team know
You don't wanna fuck around when them things blow
We ain't gotta break em down we let them things go
My team go, my team go
Six series till they find me in that beam low
Chicks near me with it like they never seen dough
Wrist clearly litted, we're making a gleam show</pre>
