[Chorus: Buddha Monk]
Babyface, here's the rum to get the party started
Delta got the 4-4 and now we on guardin
We walk with heat, ain't nothin sweat on the streets
If you walk in the slum, you get caught by dum dum niggas
What, Red Rum, Red Rum
Murder is the muthafuckin case that they gave me
Red Rum, Red Rum
Murder is the muthafuckin case (that they gave me)

[Babyface Finster] (Delta #1) {Buddha Monk}
I wanna hit some skids tonight
(Aight crook stop stealin, dogs count your slugs
But ain't nobody killin)
I know I got a chance, at this, pants is tight
(L.I.Q., got me flippin, feelin for a fight)
Wanna get my groove on, preceed to move on
(Before the break of dawn, all ya niggas is gone
Try to front and get torn, I'm at the door
With the 4-4, restin my chest, I'm fuckin livin
hardcore hearing)
{Ooh baby I like it raw, war, things ain't just peace no more}

[Delta #1]
The way I get raw is gettin ready for a war
Suited in fatigue suits, size of livin proof
Robbin niggas ain't cute, but niggas need to salute

[Babyface Finster]
I step to this creep, "What's ya name?", (Denise)
She had a steel mad conceit, and the cunt's manifique
S &amp; Jet, cuz the bodies now recked
Then I stepped, she was from the fuckin projects
Back to the party, to drink some Bacardi
Step to this chick, but her breath was type tardy
Miss La-Di-Da-Di, get off the wall so we can party
You see me scoppin, your pussy prink got me open
Damn baby

[Chorus]

[Babyface Finster]
Control party masses, pass champagne glasses
Peace and love to the Ol' Dirty Bastard
Multichin, it's the Zu Killa trend
Deadly with the pen, with the track he kills again
I'm layin my charm down, this honies all around
My section, got lifestyles for protection
Fuck that, groundin on asses, gives infections
Time to chill out for this alcohol section

[Delta #1]
16 cent on this fuckin Alezay
Pour it out for my man A, rest in piece
Love, peace and hair grease
The drama never cease, I'm rugged like a beast
With fronts in my mouth piece
Teachin niggas how to pimp
If I did it, I did it, you caught a charge for a tip
Bitch stop pagin me, I'm not tryin to hear you
You wanna fuck my physical, beep Spiritual
I'm tryin to get Drunk with the Dragon
The one night stand got ya braggin
Ya hot like a shot, with the 30-30 off the trot
I wanna bitch who smoke pot alot (*inhale*)

[Babyface Finster] (Delta #1)
Dancin with these bitches got my drawers all wet
(Yo the party just started, don't end it yet)
We gotta go Delta (nigga go to hell)
This crazy bitch is waitin at the fuckin hotel
(Let me smoke another L, and drink some more wine)
We got mad cash, but we can't buy time
(Son, it's only 15 to the break of dawn)
Let's scatter like roaches when the light come on

[Chorus]</pre>
