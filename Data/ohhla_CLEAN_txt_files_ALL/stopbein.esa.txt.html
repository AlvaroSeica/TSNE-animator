Da Wizard

I believe that the creators of the news hire crews 
to batter and abuse all the clues and keep us all confused 
and leary of leaving your home.  
For the fear of the unknown 
and now they got you in a zone 
believing only what they've shown.  
Until your mind is blown from the badness, 
sadness, madness, very little gladness.  
Until you buy protection from your fears, 
but how do you kill a fear.  
They've got you where they want you. 
In a life that's plus and minus 
you might as well use your anchor man as a security blanket 
and change your name to Linus.  
It's easy to control the metropolis 
with the amount of negativity that's fed to the populace
But you 've got to keep it clear.  
Too much can cause rebellion, 
but the right amount can cause fear.  
Enough to cause lack of trust, 
enough to cause hatred and disgust, 
enough to make you lust, 
enough to make a little kid grab the gun an bust, 
enough to make you leave your lover in the dust, 
enough to make you cuss.  
And if it wasn't bad enough to handle.  
They hit you with the 24 hour a day newschannels.   
Trying to keep us all in grief with no relief, 
they got you gritting your teeth and waiting for someone to beef.  
They giving you the foul run of it, flaky government.  
Here is the news, they need to put the word bad in front of it.  
You think that's ill, check me.  
The news is a criminal's blueprint on doing crime correctly.  
And good deeds go unheard of, 
but you hear about crime, the bad politics and of murder.  
And it's hard to read into the subjects that they lead into.  
They bleeding you with this illness they feeding you.  
Until you get full, from what you thought was a brand new cow, 
but it was the same old bull. 

Stop being blinded, 
stop being metally sleighed with this nickel and dime shit, 
we don't have to be reminded, 
'Cause if you search for yourself then the truth is where you find it.

I'm not too happy with all this shit I see on TV, 
it's gotten to me and all I do is stay confined to my misery.  
Locked away looking at ABC, NBC, CBS, CNN and MSNBC.  
Kosovo depressed me, China scares me, 
Y2K is coming to get me 
and all I see when I turn on my local news TV is the newest remedy.  
For me to cure my case of my HIV.  
Or Syphyllis or Herpes, because 20% of Americans have it 
so you know that means me.  
I look at the world pesimistically 
and I discovered it looks the same right back at me.  
The world is out to get me.  
Salesmen try to jerk me, drunk drivers aiming their cars at me 
and high school nerds are trying to hurt me.  
I don't eat beef, because the government laces it chemically, 
but I can admit I'm addicted to chicken 
the steroid-enhanced original white meat.  
An Arab killed an Israli, an Indian a Pakistani.  
A cop killed a homeless lady in Cincinnati.  
Is it just me or is the world really that crazy  
that  I can't even go to the mall 
to get myself a  pair of new Nikes.  
'Cause someone might rob me on my way out of Starbuck's coffee.  
Here you go man it's just a latte and my money, 
I'll I got is a buck-thirty.  
But you know they'll take it all according to TV 
and it's negativity.  
Last night on TV I saw death and disease, 
I saw rape and conspiracy, 
I saw shit I hoped would never happen to me.  
I saw kids with no feet and kids with no teeth living poverty 
and complete misery.  I also saw a new high on Wall Street.  
More money made today than ever in history, 
but none was giving to me or those kids that preceded.  
Fuck the media and be wary of your local news stories on TV

Stop being blinded, 
stop being metally sleighed with this nickel and dime shit, 
we don't have to be reminded, 
'Cause if you search for yourself then the truth is where you find it.
