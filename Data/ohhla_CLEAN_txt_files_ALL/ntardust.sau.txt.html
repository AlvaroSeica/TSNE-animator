[Saul Williams]
...NiggyTardust: Grippo King, philosopher, and artist
Downright to the marrow, he's the arrow through the heartless
Sunlight in the afternoon, his shadow travels furthest
Woven through the heart of doom, he's bursting through the surface
Hardly nervous, suffice to say, he understands his purpose:
Threshold King of everything, a comical absurdist
Sometimes when he talks he sings, yet keeps his high notes wordless
Sing along when Niggy sings
Without you he'd be worthless, homeless, Earth-less
Venus Hottentot, up in the circus
Freak show here him speak so properly, 'cause every word is measured against meaning
Probably scheming to unlearn us
Don't you call him by his name! White people call him 'Curtis'

[Chorus: Saul Williams]
When I say Niggy, you say nothing..
Niggy. Niggy
When I say Niggy, you say nothing
Niggy. ("Nothing!"). Shut up
When I say Niggy, you say nothing..
Niggy. Niggy
When I say Niggy, you say nothing
Niggy. ("Nothing!"). Shut up

[Saul Williams]
"Put your mama on the phone"
You can't say that, girl, Niggy's grown
What your daddy gonna do?
He can't deny what he knows true
What the preacher gonna say? Preacher can't shit, girl, the preacher gay
What your granny gonna do? She can't deny the truth
Hey! NiggyTardust, here to stay!
Paint him on your lunchbox or your thermos, for a fee
You might win the chance to hang with Niggy for a day!
Side effects may include simply doing what you say
Hey! NiggyTardust, no guitar
Ghetto Gothic millionaire
A super-duper star! Side effects may include simply being who you are
you are yourself, my darling dear, and where never niggar

[Chorus: Saul Williams]
When I say Niggy, you say nothing..
Niggy. Niggy
When I say Niggy, you say nothing
Niggy. ("Nothing!"). Shut up
When I say Niggy, you say nothing..
Niggy. Niggy
When I say Niggy, you say nothing
Niggy. ("Nothing!"). Shut up

[Saul Williams]
So what y'all niggas wanna do?
I'm standing at the Pearly Gates so you can run and get your crew
I'm knockin once then I'm bustin' through, with some gold Diadoras and a shirt that reads, "Do unto who?"
What y'all niggas wanna do?
Elevate the race or love these other motherfucker's too?
The choice is yours, which means it's up to you
But how can I love myself if I can't love you?
