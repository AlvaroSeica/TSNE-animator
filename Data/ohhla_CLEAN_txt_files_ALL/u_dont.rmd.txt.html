[Movie Sample]
All that shit right?  Right back to the television, right?
Conversations over?
You don't ever disrespect me the way you did tonight!
You understand me?  This is my house, alright?!
I paid for all of this shit.
(Get the fuck outta here
Don't you dare! Don't you dare!)
Shut your mouth, Shut up!

[Intro: Sweetleaf]
U Don't Care, U Don't Care, U Don't Care, U Don't Care

[Chorus: Sweetleaf]
U Don't Care, only stop and stare
When I'm over here, you're always over there
When I'm over there, you're always over here
When I'm far then you're near
When I'm near then you're far
Out drivin' in your car, U Don't Care
Going to the bar, U Don't Care
Swearing you're a star, and thinkin' who you are
What am I to do, is it me is it you?

[Remedy]
Yeah, yeah, but I do, you never get a clue (never)
I tried to do us, but it's all about you
Yeah, U Don't Care bitch? Well go and do your hair bitch
You wanna be rich bitch? Well I'm the one that got you shit
Judging our relationship, always out comparin' it
Bitch start carin', and all the wear and tear that we share
Wouldn't be so hard on a heart left scarred
If you don't get your way (way), another cloudy day (day)
Everything is real love, check it, from the first day we met
Until the day I made this record (U Don't Care)
You was always on the set
To my career you were second, to the rest, you was first (U Don't Care)
I love you (U Don't Care), you're my personal nurse
(U Don't Care, U Don't Care)

[Break: Sweetleaf (Remedy)]
Yeah, yeah, but I do
(U Don't Care, U Don't Care)
Nah love, that's not true
(U Don't Care, U Don't Care)
Huh, it's me and you
(U Don't Care, U Don't Care
Momma always told me life's not fair)
And poppa always told you girl be prepared
(You say you do but you don't, say you will but you won't
U Don't Care anymore, I'm packin' up my bags) Where you goin'?
(And I'm walkin' out the door)
What for, what for, what for, what for, what for?
(U Don't Care, U Don't Care)

[Remedy]
Yeah, Heaven's angel, I rock you like a bangle
Dream lover crushed you from all angles, star spangled
I brought you in, you with the family
Things were good, you always understanding me
Yeah, I turned your life into a fantasy
Did all that I could do with it, as far as true
I was always true with it, this is you and me, me and you
Just doin' it, you went and blew it
I love you, always thinking of you
Don't let the petty he said, she said ever get above you
What you mean that some silly chicken's cluckin'?
Talkin' who I'm fuckin'

[Chorus]

[Movie Sample]
You still fuckin my sister!?!
Get the fuck out my house!
Don't fuck with my sister!
Don't fuck my sister man!
I fuckin told you, you don't be fuckin lyin!
I'll fuckin kill ya ass {*girl screaming*}
{*gunshot*} </pre>
