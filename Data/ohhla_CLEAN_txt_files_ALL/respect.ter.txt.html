Typed by: Kredebabz@hotmail.com

[Chorus]
You better respect my walk, cuz my walk is mean
BX, NY, all across The Bean
Back down to Miami where the girls are hot
The ladies, man they know how I rock
You better respect my walk, cuz my walk is mean
LA, LA all over the scene
Back down to TX where the weather is hot
Recognize when you see a player up in your spot, ayo

[Termanology]
Ayo I'm like the last real lyricist alive
Let me break it down why I'm in the top 5
Name me 5 rappers out that enlighten minds
Now name me 5 more rappers don't like 9's
You can name me 5 rapper that don't write lies
And name me 5 good rappers that are unsigned
Along with 5 more rappers that are on time
With the beat intertwine with the street like I'm
Them I'm, properly gonna tell you
That you still out your mind, no one spittin' like I'm 
Plus I'm, 5 mixtapes deep
20 songs each, did it all unsigned
No lie, I say it so it's understood
When you from the hood independent money good
I do the R&amp;B shit or the killer shit
You gonna have to censor this, homie I'm a lyricist

[Chorus]
You better respect my walk, cuz my walk is mean
BX, NY, all across The Bean
Back down to Miami where the girls are hot
The ladies, man they know how I rock
You better respect my walk, cuz my walk is mean
LA, LA all over the scene
Back down to TX where the weather is hot
Recognize when you see a player up in the spot, ayo

[Termanology]
Ayo, I was warming up, but if you put me in the Porsche truck
And get my mamma crib heat warming up, I give you all that stuff
R&amp;B, hip-hop, pop, underground, man, I do all that stuff
The slow writers ghostwriter, cuz I flow tighter
Dependant on the price, I can make your flow tight
Whatever you into, the pencil is in tune
I show what this pen can do
It could take a little bummy rap dude with no money
Who ain't never get a honey turn his days hella sunny
My minds my 9, my pens my Mac-10
My target; all you wack rapper writin' fraud shit
I'm from the lawless Murda Mass, flawless
Diamond shinin' on you neck, then we rob Â‘em
It ain't a problem, all over the map
Bitches recognize the game, killas recognize the rap

[Chorus]
So they respect my walk, cuz my walk is mean
BX, NY, all across The Bean
Back down to Miami where the girls are hot
The ladies, man they know how I rock
You better respect my walk, cuz my walk is mean
LA, LA all over the scene
Back down to TX where the weather is hot
Recognize when you see a player up in the spot, ayo</pre>
