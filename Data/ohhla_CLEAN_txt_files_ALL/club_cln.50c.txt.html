[50 Cent]
Go, go, go
Go, go, go

[Pre-Chorus: 50 Cent]
Go shorty
It's your birthday
We gon' party like it's your birthday
We gon' sip Bacardi like it's your birthday
And you know
We don't give a [{*fuck*}], it's not your birthday!

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
You can find me in the club
Bottle full of bub'
Mama, I got what you need
If you need to feel the buzz
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't in to makin' love
So come give me a hug, if you into gettin' rubbed

[Chorus]

(Verse 1)
When I pull up out front, you see the Benz on dubs (Uh hun)
When I roll twenty deep, it's always drama in the club (Yeah)
Now they heard I roll with Dre, everybody show me love
When you sell like Eminem, you get plenty of groupie love
But homie
Ain't nothin' changed, pros down, G's up
I see Xzibit in the club, hey man, roll them trees up (Roll that)
If you watch how I move, you mistake me for a player or pimp
Been hit with a few shovels, I ain't walk in a limp (I'm aight)
In the hood, and that lady sayin', "50, you hot" (Uh hun)
They like me, I want 'em to love me like they love Pac
But holla at New York, fa' sho, to tell ya, I'm loco (Yeah)
And the plan is to put the rap game in a chokehold (Uh hun)
I'm fully focused, man
My money on my mind
Got a mil', out the deal, and I'm still in the grind (Whoo!)
Now shorty said she feelin' my style, she feelin' my flow (Uh hun)
Her girlfriend wanna get by/bi, and they ready to go (OKAY!)

[Chorus] Twice

[Bridge: 50 Cent]
My flow, my show brought me the dough
That bought me all my fancy things
My crib, my cars, my crews
My jewels, look, homie, I done came up
And I ain't changed

(Verse 2)
And you should love it
Way more than you hate it
Oh, you mad?
I thought that you'd be happy I'd made it (Whoo!)
I'm that cat by the bar, toastin' to the good life
Moved out the hood, right, you tryin' to pull me back, right
When my dawg, get to pumpin' "In Da Club," it's on
I wink my eye at ya chick, if she smile, she gone
If the roof on fire, man
Just let it burn
If you talkin' about money, homie, I ain't concerned
I'm a tell you what Banks told me, "Cous' go 'head, switch the style up"
And if they hate, then let 'em hate, then watch the money pile up
Or we could go upside your head with a bottle of bub'
Come on, they know where we be (Whoo!)

[Chorus] Twice

[50 Cent]
Ha ha ha
Don't try to act like we don't know where we be neither
We in the club all the time, it's a prob' to pop off
Shady, Aftermath
Ha ha</pre>
