You sweet young thing you
Whatever you do Lord knows you do it nice and easy
You keep it nice and long
You sexy thang you
Whatever it is you want from me you know I'll satisfy
Just keep the love at home

You give me pleasure
Unlike any pleasure that I've ever felt or ever seen
I can't get enough of you in me
You know I treasure
Each and every waking moment that you spend with me
I'm in ecstasy

1 - 	Let's do it again
	'Cause I love to make sweet love to you baby
	Let's do it again
	I wanna go all night long

Repeat 1

You precious thang you
I love what you do when you do
And you do it oh so special
I don't see nothin'wrong
With nothing 'bout you
Whatever it is that makes you feel so very special
A baby please please keep it on

I so desire
Everything about you and I want you close to me
As close as close could ever be
Come light the fire
That waits for you yearns for you that burns inside of me
Take me to ecstasy

Repeat 1

Don't stop please don't stop please please don't stop it
(don't you don't you don't you don't you stop it)
Don't stop please don't stop please please don't stop it
(don't you don't you)
Just do it do it do it do it
Ooh ahh ooh ahh

Repeat 1</pre>
