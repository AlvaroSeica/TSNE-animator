[Intro: MC Ren]
Msss, man
Like the long live I be feelin' nigga, fuck the intro

[Chorus: MC Ren X2]
The saga continues right before your eyes
The saga continues cause it's do or die
The saga continues right before your eyes
You know why? (why?)
Cause I'm Ruthless for life

[MC Ren]
Nigga ten years passed, and we still up in that ass
Villain make it all continuing, look at all the shit you in "that's right"
Eazy-Duz-It, happy like the shit we used to do
5 niggaz comin' out the C-P-T, so fuck you
Time changed for the good
Niggaz in the hood be comin' up:
Villain can you set it off again, you know, you should
Villain just take this shit back to 1989
Where these niggaz shit, I'm bustin, niggaz know they couldn't find
Dream Team lovers, Egyptian fan based
Villain hit the scene, all them fools got erased
Threw a motherfuckin' monkey, wrench up in the rap game
Since I hooked up with E, shit ain't never been the same
Opened up doors for you niggaz that be thinkin'
that your flows be on tizight
Bitin' what I wrizite, jokin' when I recite
Feelin' manuscripts when I MC
if it ain't rough it ain't me

[Chorus: MC Ren X2]
The saga continues right before your eyes
The saga continues cause it's do or die
The saga continues right before your eyes
You know why? (why?)
Cause I'm Ruthless for life

[MC Ren]
All y'all motherfuckin' G's nigga, like Eric Wright "that's right"
You can floss for your bitch, but you know this shit is tight "nigga"
Cause when y'all niggaz started rappin, who you tryin' to be?
I'ma slap you cause you lyin' if you don't be sayin' me
Or the other 3, that the FBI be phone tappin' "nigga, nigga"
Shoot the government before you niggaz start rappin'
that was clone city "what's up" I gotta bomb it like Iraq
Use my alias, spend my nights at The Shack "that's right"
Ruthless attack all the way to two thou'
Try to black it out!, but you never knew how and when
I walk through the crowd, I'm seein' motherfucker's brain
I hear their bitches sayin' ask MC Ren "MC Ren"
Makin' fools Sway when I roll to King Tech's
Because I started cussin' all you fools gettin' checks
Ruthless for life, see, that be my state of mind
Y'all can Kizz My Black Azz one more time, ugh

[Chorus: MC Ren X2]
The saga continues right before your eyes
The saga continues cause it's do or die
The saga continues right before your eyes
You know why? (why?)
Cause I'm Ruthless for life

[MC Ren]
I run a hundred miles also I can MC  (*Great Explosion*)
Villain wants that bomb so I get with L.T.
Ain't nothin' changed, we find them, fuck them, then flee
While you're hatin', pillow talkin', with that bitch, she want me
Niggaz weed crazy, Dre and Snoop turned you out
Now y'all cristal sippin', y'all niggaz be trippin'
Make the West look like ass, all full of shit
Investin' drug money, shit still gettin' hit
What it takes for y'all quit, Ruthless got it on lock
Y'all shootin' videos tryin' to look like 'Pac "Pac"
Here we come, here we come, blowin' up your spot   "like this"
with my little brother Jubee and that Bigg homie Rocc "that' right"
Full Circle, all that shit gon' repeat
ugh, when the shit dropped, niggaz clownin' in the streets "niggaz clown"
The saga continues right before your eyes "nigga"
Villain gives a fuck nigga, cause this is Ruthless For Life

[Chorus: MC Ren till end]
The saga continues right before your eyes
The saga continues cause it's do or die
The saga continues right before your eyes
You know why? (why?)
Cause I'm Ruthless for life</pre>
