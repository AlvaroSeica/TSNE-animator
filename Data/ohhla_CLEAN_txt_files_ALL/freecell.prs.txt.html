Freedom, Freedom, Freedom, Freedom
This is how we ride and roll - soldier fo life fo' sho
Freedom, Freedom, Freedom, Freedom
This is how we ride and roll - soldier fo life fo' sho (2x)

(Paris)
We come back to the days of - grenades up
Black fist raised up - we stay rough
Come this way cause - the game fucked
Can't stay away from - the main stuff

still bust when we ride, still game
still bust any time, fuck fame
still rhyme under pressure, still bangin'
still prime, niggas wetcha, still aimin'

Still put a fist in - the system
Still kill a killa cop, we still win
Still be the one to expose the beast (when it's)
Still un-American to be for peace (yeah)

Revenge is a dish best served with steel
If it's on then, lets get it on for real
Can't shut us up - cut us down - never regret
Fuck Bush, I'ma say it loud - raisin' a fist - we holla

(Chorus)
Freedom, Freedom, Freedom, Freedom
This is how we ride and roll - soldier fo life fo' sho
Freedom, Freedom, Freedom, Freedom
This is how we ride and roll - soldier fo life fo' sho

(M1 - Dead Prez)
RBG'd up, yeah, ready to get freed up
Bangin' on the system, ready to turn the heat up
Malcolm X cocktail, ready to burn the streets up
Holla if ya hear me big homie, it's time to eat somthin'

Picture me rollin', me Paris and Chuck D'd up
Dickies and white tee'd up, throwin' them O.G.s love
Listen up, rule number 1 is no snitchin'
Switch up and you gon' have to eat a clip up 'till you hiccup

(Stic - Dead Prez)
My reality is poverty, police brutality
How I came into this revolutionary mentality
Comin' up in my hood, it's an everyday thang
Niggas is hungry and starvin' that's why niggas bang

The O.G.s put me up on the jewels of the game
Ain't no wins in the street if you comin' up lame
That's why I walk how I walk and I claim what I claim
Red, Black to the Green with a gangsta lean

(Chorus)
Freedom, Freedom, Freedom, Freedom
This is how we ride and roll - soldier fo life fo' sho
Freedom, Freedom, Freedom, Freedom
This is how we ride and roll - soldier fo life fo' sho

(Public Enemy)
Get back, we put it back on the map
With Power, a panther return to growl
What I'm talkin', Guerrilla Funkin'
And now we back and I'm rappin' to back 'em off again

What I'm spittin' got 'em trippin' we rush the fakes
To keep us livin' I'll keep givin' 'em records to break
They'll never master me, they'll never master P
Why we blast, harass until we get a piece

Bring the noise, Public Enemy number 1
And P-Dog'll bust, in God we trust
A def jam without the Def Jam we rise
To rush injustice, brush lies aside

What ya need - self-sense and self-defense now
We got it - representin' we bail through the crowd
Be around and 'round, you can't ignore the sound
We still say feel the Prophets of Rage - Power to the people say

(Chorus)
Freedom, Freedom, Freedom, Freedom
This is how we ride and roll - soldier fo life fo' sho
Freedom, Freedom, Freedom, Freedom
This is how we ride and roll - soldier fo life fo' sho

(Paris)
Rebels at it come again
That's why we conspire so you never win
Keep it calmer when we ride so you never seein'
Niggas aim between the eyes so you never mend

Field niggas in the front be the first to bust
GuerrillaFunk.com who you gon' trust?
With all this talk about the war they forgettin' us
Broke schools and abuse made the noose a must

Holla black - fuck a pig and these killers wars
Around the world every border it's the same story
Anywhere that it's color it ain't never peace
Africa, South America and Middle East

Move in packs bust back at these killa foes
Reach first make the heat spurts so he know
No blood for the rich - they been exposed
Now it's power to the people everywhere I go - and everybody's sayin..

(Chorus)
Freedom, Freedom, Freedom, Freedom
Yeah, my live niggas standin' in here, Yeah, my live niggas standin' over there
Freedom, Freedom, Freedom, Freedom
Yeah, my live niggas standin' in here, Yeah, my live niggas standin' over there</pre>
