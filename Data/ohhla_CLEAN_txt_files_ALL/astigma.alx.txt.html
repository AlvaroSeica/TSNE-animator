Picture this, visionist, servin 20-20 vision
With the future stigmatized, insecure of how he's living
Addicted to a past never coming to fruition
Yet still viewing through the present without aid or provision
Exorcism of the demons, leave the shell of man lifeless
I'm 19 years old - stuck in a midlife crisis!
Look left, look right, say "fuck it" then go straight
When the fork came, I took it - started clearing off my plate
Til fate stepped in and gave a little boy his courage
A flashlight in the dark - gave his soul its sole purpose
That's why this pen will never stop - the pad will never drop
Each surmounted height spawns another needing to be topped
Until the goal is manifest, communicated clearly
Emotively emancipated, lay it out for you dearly
Sincerely yours, now and ever, til it reads on the tombstone
"Here Lies Alexipharmic", his work done - now going home

[Chorus]
Lay it all out on the line, I wonder how I'll be remembered
Cease the moment while it's given, holding hands with time together
Light shine in through the darkness, lift my head through stormy weather
Through it all it's now or never, and I'm siding with forever

Heavy handed benevolence, a self-evidenced perfectionist
Documentary through writing - filmed without hesitance
And no alternate lenses, no varying perceptions
Just an author and his camera, filming his own reflection
I can't promise that one day any of this will make sense
Between logic and insanity I shimmy cross the fence
Smiling down on the spectacle, fertilizing both sides
The grass growing greatly equally on the divides
In retrospect, it's most convenient to peer back in hindsight
Second-guessing each decision, unforeseen by blind sight
But all I ever wanted was to understand conditions
All I ever needed was to diagnose these symptoms
All I ever wished for was to pick apart the fragments
Fixing something out of nothing, mixing change in with the stagnant
And all I've ever given was a piece of the part
So you can put it back together before it all falls apart

[Chorus]
Lay it all out on the line, I wonder how I'll be remembered
Cease the moment while it's given, holding hands with time together
Light shine in through the darkness, lift my head through stormy weather
Through it all it's now or never, and I'm siding with forever</pre>
