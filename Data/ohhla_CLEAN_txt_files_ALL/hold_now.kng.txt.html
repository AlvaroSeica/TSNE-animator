[Intro: Timbo King]
Yeah, Young Brook, the whole B.V.I. (Brooklyn shit, nigga)
56 shit, yeah, Jarrett, P-City, Self Rachet
Flatbush, let's go

[Chorus: Timbo King]
Yeah, guns in ya face, all you sayin' is "Hold it now"
The block we hold down, niggaz don't come around
Bitches wanna fuck for a fast buck
Niggaz want a pull of that haze cut

[Timbo King]
Yo, drunk off the easy geezy, G's up, Bo Keezy
My team pump deezy on the grind, so greezy
We Cash Millionaire niggaz like Lil' Weezy
So put ya money where yo' ounce is, it's that easy
It's Gutter, P-City, 56, air base
Niggaz'll air the place and won't catch a court case
Up and down the block, treat it like a staircase
We them gangstas that lick shots in ya face
We got the map to heaven, spray off the Mac-11
Godbody, practice seven, we done attacked ya Reverend
My block dirty, two clips, yeah I popped thirty
You frog niggaz wanna leak ahead and act Kermy
For the love of money, gangstas and hoe models
I mean motel bitches with fake Gucci goggles
We beat niggaz up, no, we don't beat 'em down
You better hold it down, yeah, hold it now

[Self Rachet]
Why you feel like my team won't make yo' ass it (hold it now)
We knew you for years, but it don't make no difference now
The street life, young bucks get older now
(Why you wanna stand up in my set, hold it now)
I'm comin' down like, whatever you want, you get served
Chip a piece of the block and sell you the curb
I charge half, have my man come and rob you for the third
I'm like, adverbs that describe the verbs
Like, niggaz is pussy and niggaz is herbs
Like, you niggaz is flocks, you niggaz is birds
Like, they wiggin', they buggin', they don't know shit
Like, a equal split is a equal split
Like, they wearin' blue and they blood, wearin' red and they crip
They ass backwards, get clapped quick
Check me on 56, coppin' a pound of that shit
Of that, sticky icky (Why you wanna stand up in my set)
Yo, back on 57, that's the 7/11
Bitch fights, bitches fits with guns and weed all night
I rock 50 and 50 inch, you rock 12-12s, I'm killin' it
My niggaz run around killin' ya peeps
"Are those niggaz real, boo? Yeah, those be studs"
Cop a 2G2 Impala, bitch, and sit it on dubs
After a while, the six vial, lay at the club
Ask around, niggaz like "Oh, he bugged
Cuz love walk around like he don't give a fuck"
Recognize a gangsta
When I hear "Start 'em", everybody get banksta
Triple-O, specialize in cash flow
Yeah, the gear, I cop it

[Outro: Self Rachet]
B.V.I., 56, this is where we be at, B
Come holla at ya boy, man
You need a little bit of this?
A little bit of that?
Holla back...
P-City, you know that
Gutterman, Fuzzy Leo where you at, huh?
Wake the fuck up, nigga!
It's the block... Timbo!
Hold 'em down, please
Pick 'em up, pick 'em up, Timbo
Hurry up, please
Drag 'em to the back, man
They finished, man
Come on, man, hold it now</pre>
