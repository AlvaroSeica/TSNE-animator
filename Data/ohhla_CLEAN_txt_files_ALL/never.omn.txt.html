never loose a grip on reality, never loose a grip on life
never let the evil take you under
cause we aint going out withought a fight

listen to the testimony of an eye witness
took this trial by fire, call life and strife business
high risk is involved at every waking moment
tasking on competitive, negative forces that you've grown with
products become factors in environments
where money is subtracted and rations get divided between
the aspiring, righteous and tyrants
fighting amongst as appose to against
tiring ourselves for the battles that have yet to begin
we first must mentally win
from within starts the search for the strength to sustain
everything we gain, including stress pains
good times, sad songs, blessed days and bad habits
its all human, no person exempt, we all go thru it
but who gets to see the sun rise on the other side of night

never loose a grip on reality, never loose a grip on life
never let the evil take you under
cause we aint going out withought a fight

my parents raised their kids like pit bulls
to split sculls when I'm dismal
I ditch school when ever I dropped a pencil
a fist full of bad luck, ive been thru the most
all my problems do is add up and then I loose hope
abuse dope, a fuse blows
then all I see is green light, anything goes
nothing seems right
life, love, freedom, all of the above
I love breathing, then seem to manage besides my upbringing
I'm a dreamer, cannabis, sativa chiefer
believer, burning like a heeba
with my feet up on the coast of lima
then its back to earth with an empty bag of dirt
its hard to live a dream when everyday you have to work
you gotta rise above, you cant hide your love
its too strong, your music cant die its too young
sometimes less is more, the best is yours to come
cherish every son given, thank god I'm still living
and I
never loose a grip on reality, never loose a grip on life
never let the evil take you under
cause we aint going out withought a fight</pre>
