Gettin rowdy! (Ha ha ha, rowdy)
Rowdy!
We gettin rowdy! (Oh we gettin rowdy on yo' ass)
Bout to do the thang (bout to get rowdy)
Rowdy! (Geah)

[K-Kwik]
So many damn styles get tossed up in the mix
I got 'em yellin get rowdy K-Kwik
We gettin rowdy!  I'ma move some thangs
They wanna see me bust a move and shake that ass like jang-a-lang
I got your flesh crawlin when you see me
Ladies wanna feel me, knuckleheads wanna try and beat me
I get down, nice so easy
I get greasy, LOW DOWN DIRTY AND SLEAZY
Teasin, I'll be the rash
on your ass, hollerin, sufferin succotash!
I ain't fearin nobody
Damn right K-Kwik gettin rowdy

[Chorus]
Gettin rowdy! (Uhh)
Rowdy! (Back gettin rowdy)
We gettin rowdy! (Geah, good lord)
Bout to do the thang
Rowdy! (Geah, gettin rowdy)

[K-Kwik]
I'ma be a legend like Timmy and Lassie
I get sassy (geah) these people acts nasty
They call me K-Kwik
I'm the hottest thang since a bowl of grits
Clip ass and kickin ass spreadin like a bad rash
Get them heads bobbin, movin like whiplash
Don't get stuck, shake and tossed like a salad
Don't be all on my hip, cause K-Kwik ain't havin it
Come to fuss, kickin dust, applejacks better hush
Be the big dawg daddy on ya, bout to bust
Pump your fists and get rowdy like dat
Bump your fists and get yo' hat rack cracked

[K-Kwik]
I'ma be a legend like Timmy and Lassie
I get sassy, all these people acts nasty
They call me K-Kwik
I'm the hottest thang burnin since a bowl of grits
Comin fast and kickin ass spreadin like a bad rash
Keep them heads movin, bobbin like a whiplash
Don't get stuck, shake and tossed like a salad
Don't be all on my hip, cause K-Kwik ain't havin it
You can fuss, kickin dust, applejacks better hush
Be the big dawg daddy bringin drama bout to bust
Pump your fists and get rowdy like dat
Bump your fists or get yo' hat rack cracked
