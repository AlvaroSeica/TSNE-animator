Intro Chorus:
Everything I had imagined is starting to happen
Everything I wanted all the dreams that I had back then
Yeah they're happening happening now happening now
I told them

Verse 1:
That I was gon be the illest rapper they ever gon see
Make a name for a city that you never done heard of
Talking dumb'll get your ass murdered
Wordup
Stainless steel Spanglish watch your head I only aims to kill
So if you thinking you was holding the torch then lay it down
Cuz if I didn't say it before then I'll say it now
I'm the Eighth Wonder the Lost Ark the Holy Grail
Represent the hustler Ville corners to Coney Isle
Smelling like some aromatic
Had to drop some new shit cuz I got these kiddies itching like some
heroin addicts
So put it in your veins ho
I'm in the clouds like a motherfucking angel
Yeah I'm way way high above
Fly as fuck Spanish got the Midas touch

Chorus:
Everything I had imagined is starting to happen
Everything I wanted all the dreams that I had back then
Yeah they're happening
Happening now happening now
I told them best believe I told them
No one would believe me so indeed I had to show them
Now I'm floating yeah I'm floating
Up in the clouds up in the clouds clouds

Verse 2:
I was raised in a lion's den
Take my sword cut the head off Leviathan
Evils try to hold me back tell em try again
Cuz I don't talk about what might've been I intend
To disguist to disrupt
Take this pussy ass game and get it fist-fucked yeah
Pull on up to the club in the old school
And hop up out her looking at em like I told you
Cuz y'all is old news and this the Renaissance
This is that next level that upper echelon
Raw never been stepped upon and I do it my way
Coming at me wrong'll do you like Sade
And bid you adieu
I'm blessed but my name really isn't Achoo
If this was High Noon then I'd have my guns drawn
You rappers best start to run boy you're done for

Chorus:
Everything I had imagined is starting to happen
Everything I wanted all the dreams that I had back then
Yeah they're happening
Happening now happening now
I told them best believe I told them
No one would believe me so indeed I had to show them
Now I'm floating yeah I'm floating
Up in the clouds up in the clouds clouds

Verse 3:
Where do I go from here
There is this one thing I hold so dear
And I know that I can't let it go and I won't
Cuz I'm making my own
So it's fuck what they've been telling me

Chorus:
Everything I had imagined is starting to happen
Everything I wanted all the dreams that I had back then
Yeah they're happening
Happening now happening now
I told them best believe I told them
No one would believe me so indeed I had to show them
Now I'm floating yeah I'm floating
Up in the clouds up in the clouds clouds</pre>
