Y'all done fucked up, and let me in this mix
Interscope just signed me, so I'm finna get...
Y'all done fucked up, and let me in this mix
Interscope just signed me, so I'm finna get...
Y'all done fucked up, and let me in this mix
Interscope just signed me, so I'm finna get rich
And that's the main reason, why I got scrill
Cause I've been having thangs, way before I got this deal
It ain't shit for me, to spit a hit track
Ask Mo, I can do one less than five minutes flat
I got a universal style, I can take it cross the globe
Cause everybody knows, Killa got some awesome flows
I'm from the home, of the Houston Rockets
I've been hot, since Dougie Fresh use to drop shit
Back in the days, with the Get Fresh Crew
This the Day 1 Fam, we the spit mess crew

[Hook - 4x]
Killa, Killa, Killa, Killa
Killa, Killa, Killa, Killa (that's who they want)

[Kyleon]
See I'm a syrup and Sprite drinker, and you on Dasani
You bout being broke, but I'm bout having money
I'm bout to ship, three birds to the block
While you punks steady bumping, on the curb of the block
Cause I'm connected, like Dub and Mack 10
Cause I'm always packing, a snub or Mac 10
For a nigga, think he taking my work
My trigger finger, gon start making it squirt you in the dirt
I'm bout to drop man, niggaz like god damn
Cause most of these niggaz with deals, ain't hot as I am
I'm bout to do it again, make some hit music again
When I show up, and prove it again
