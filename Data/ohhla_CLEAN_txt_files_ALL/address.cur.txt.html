[Curren$y]
Uhh, nigga for what
get down wit them suckas when I'm high as fuck
and they, under us, catch a crook in ya neck
from tryna watch the jets
mr. tokyo drift, spend yen on the vette
lookin' for yo bitch fool, take one guess
she caught up in the rapture
waken and baken, anita's greatest hits blastin'
pedal mashin', paper twistin'
scraper engine, rad racer
no 3-d glasses, jus a high ass rapper
spitta, nigga in the building now
I'm on the roof chillin'
the pool up here, a couple chicks I grew up wit
bottles in the cooler, if you don't know how to do it
homie I'll school ya
barrel roll, loop to loop, top gun maneuver
makin' hot wheelz outta hoopty's
holdin' it down like balloon strings
 
[Hook]
its all good
I ain't gotta be serious
its already understood
ain't nothin', 
ain't nothin changed but the address
fool, ain't nothin' changed but the address
we still in the same mode
niggas switchin' the scripts 
we still playin' the same role
and so, ain't nothin' changed but the address
fool, ain't nothin' changed
 
[Stalley]
starin' out the villa at the ocean, miles long 
tryna figure out raps, to put up in a song
nights long, but the days short
nike shorts, argyle socks, jordan 3's, lounge gear
long beard, you can tell I ain't from round here
obvious, with the occasional glare from the natives
callin' back tellin' momma I'm a make it
not complacent with the lifestyle
feels good, but it hard to crack a smile
when the ones you came up with, not around
roll a joint after pickin' thru the pile
whole perception done change
funny how a three hour flight can make your life change
type things I be thinkin' on
when I'm driftin' in and out of herb clouds, hangin' on
every second of the moment 
so you can feel all the memories I come home with
and those that miss me, I'll be back don't trip 
in a 'maro with the shift kit, ocean side
doors open while I try not to be sea sick
plottin' in the tropics, thinkin' bout how I'm gone run ish
back in the states when I'm leavin'
