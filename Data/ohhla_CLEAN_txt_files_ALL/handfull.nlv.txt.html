But don't get spook!! If yall don't try nothin'!! I won't shoot!!
Clutchin' my weapons!! And ejectin' on your whole crew!!
So respect my mind!! Or get'cha neck broke!!
Mad cuz I got ounces like big bars of soap!!
Lookin' at'chall through my scope!! Cuz all this hatin' gotta cease!!
Don't trip!! I'll split'cho wig!! And leave you with uh crease!!
I'm utamed like uh wild beast!!
You wanna go in that water,up against Reap?!
Thats like ya peeing in the Mediterranean Sea!!
Where all the sharks!! Piranhas!! And lobsters be!! You won't last long!!
Plus,the crime cannot be solved!! So Fuck Sherlock Holmes!!
Grim Reapor is known for bustin' uh few domes!! Stealin' uh few Souls!!
You know that little Nigga from 6th &amp; B!! With the 6 golds!!
