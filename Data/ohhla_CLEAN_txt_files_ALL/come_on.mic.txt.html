[Chorus 2X: Iron Mic]
I'm screaming, come on, if you want it, nigga
We right here, we not running, nigga
I'm screaming, come on, if you want it, nigga
We right here, them apes is coming, nigga

[Iron Mic]
Aiyo, bring it if you wanna, nigga, I ain't scared
You can find me right on the corner, you better come prepared
You better be aware, for them Ruthless boys
Nigga, we play with them guns like them shits was a toy
Yeah, I'm from New York, got Bastardz in the south
ATL on down, and know what we about
They know about my click, they know we spit them fifths
They need some medical attention, these niggas is sick
Cuz we on they ass, and they time is up
Most of ya'll rappers suck, can't wrap it up, plus ya gun don't bust
We spitting them slugs, we flipping them drugs
Biggie taught me how to flip my shit when he did it with them Thugs
But ain't harming me, and you ain't harming me
Nigga, my gun collection look like the armory
I advise you not to bother me, cuz it ain't hard to see that
Iron Mic is the champ, you don't wanna spar with me now

[Chorus 2X]

[Iron Mic]
Aiyo, I love the south, but I don't pop my collar
Pop that muthafucking glock, make yo punk ass holler
Nigga, Iron Mic's my name, I'm not a fucking lame
Ruthless Bastardz, we was born to bang
Remember we was with Wu, shit done changed
We got a brand new thing, nigga, it's on again
Pop Ya Head Off Records, don't ever disrespect
We the best in the world, you better cut the check
Or you gon' miss out, you know what this shit is bout
Run up in your house, top your kids and your spouse
And I can talk it, cuz I, did it, before
Don't give a fuck about you gun, you never spit it before, nigga

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
