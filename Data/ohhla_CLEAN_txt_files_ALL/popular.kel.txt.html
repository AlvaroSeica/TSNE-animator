[Pusha T] - talking
You know what I am
You know what I do
Well at least I thought you knew
They call me Pusha
Damn

I take ya like a slap in the face
Everytime the bass is mentioned like I had bad intentions
Listen, I thought love was given
So for you I did those things that were missin
Never have to say please gimme borrow
As long as I got yay and two semi autos
And connetts in the jets like wetback Carlos
I ain't askin' you to follow
Just think about tomorrow, please

[Kelis]
I should have known by the way that you stared
Eyeing passes by like your rich but life ain't fair
But ya

Chorus: x1
Make my record skip
Make my record skip
Make my record skip
Make my record skip

I would have never talked to you if I had known you was a popular thug
Hey, popular thug
I would have never talked to you if I had known you was a popular thug
Hey, popular thug


(Pusha T)
I can't help if I'm a thug and I'm popular
I think that come along with driving a shocking car
Watch the coke light up they life the rocks with stars
Had friends talking crippled cuz they locked they jaw
Aw Pusha T you think its call that you deal
'Bout as cool as that breeze on the beach in Brazil
As long as fiends want cain then I'm gon' slang
When my financial change then I'm gon' change

[Kelis]
I should have seen in the way you touched my hand
Shuffling your car keys but sounded like a gentleman
But ya

Chorus: x1 (last lines x3)

[Pusha T]
You don't know it yet
Its the life that I live that you love and the fact that I'm a thug
That had you holding techs
When you really didn't know what it was but you did it out of love
Shit, far from deprived give you all of your fetishes
Like treacherous necklaces and beget etceteras
Colours coming out make your head spin like exorcist
Spending bright futures in the hood all them no good messages

[Kelis]
I should have heard it in the way you said my name
While I analyzed your tone you were formulating games
But ya

Chorus: x1 (last lines x4)

Hey, Popular thug</pre>
