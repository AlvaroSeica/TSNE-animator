Typed by: AZ Lyrics

So now you wanna know
But where was you when I was broke?
Now I see love you've never shown
So what you think I'm bading?
Ay mum I swear we made it

Ahh, so fuck them, they don't go as hard as me
Who's been claiming that they're ill?
Fuck them, I'm a disease
I put my money where my mouth is
They be lying through their teeth
Oh and don't be mistaken, I stall it down a pagon

Ahh, so fuck them, they don't go as hard as me
I don't raise the bar so high, no satellite can find me
They can keep chasing their dreams until I clap them out their sleep
Piss-pissed that they're fading, but then they've been cremated

Lies. You've been gassing out them hoes, with your bullshit
'Cause you've been pissing on your balls with your small dick
Look, I got my willy out. HEY
And the camera's on, but nottin' can't be wrong with that if that's what Harry's on

Tarzan's in the booth big, JarJan in my hand
I ain't showing of my tan, I'm just Letting my shit hang
I'm like half the size of Ricky bitch, I sound nuttin' like Drizzy
It's time I beat up the game like, Chris Breezy did to RiRi

That's just D-A taking a P-P-Y, I'm doing Migi
Them ringtone rappers ain't got no credit, come rings around me
And breaks one leg in, piece o' cake
Soft and sweet, I'll piss on them they roll toilet seats
I shit on them, oily freaks, they'll never catch me on a sunbed!

'Cause no one cares about, what the fuck was made in Chelsea
The only way is the streets, don't care what no one tells me
Started of, one zed, two shots, none left, ten man, one ped
Ten times later; ahah-ahah, BLOAW, ahah-ahah

Pussy roll out my carpet, 'cause the King of the Jungle, just took the piss out the muppet
He took a shit on a record and wiped his ass with an Artist
Didn't even get time to flush it, 'cause the fucking thing charted. Haha
It's over. You finished? Shut up
You dickheads be quiet. I'm stuffing my face and I'm taking pussy
You on a diet?

You the type to go to Gucci- Pick up a hat just to try it
Take a picture, post it on Twitter, then don't even buy it
You cat. You don't hustle, You just listen to nip CD
The only strap you ever see is on top of your kicks G
I got jacked once before and you can even ask Tinchy
I got them out my shit back and it wasn't in Finchley

You see my chain's link to my pride
If you take that it comes with my life (track)
We'll take outside not even my toilet will let shit slide
Let alone booky manning out whip
Don't think they're playing around with their dick
If only you see the shape of that clip- BOOM, BOOM
Suck your mum you prick

So now you wanna know
But where was you when I was broke?
Now I see love you've never shown
So what you think I'm bading?
Ay mum I swear we made it

So fuck them, they don't go as hard as me
Who's be claiming that they're ill?
Fuck them, I'm a disease
I put my money where my mouth is
They be lying through their teeth
Oh and don't be mistaken, I stall it down a pagon

So fuck them, they don't go as hard as me
I don't raise the bar so high, no satellite can find me
They can keep chasing their dreams until I clap them out their sleep
Piss-Pissed that they're fading, but then they've been cremated

Ahahah-ah pum-day
Ahah-Ahah-Ahah, I'm the- King of the Jungle
Oh, no ones fucking with Tarzan
So fuck them!
Ah ah, ah ah</pre>
