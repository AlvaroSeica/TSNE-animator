[Chorus]
Video game lover, we should, with each other
I said, video game lover, we should, with each other
Don't act like we don't feel the same
Baby, baby, baby quit playin' them games
Don't act like we don't feel the same
Baby, baby, baby quit playing them games

[Verse 1]
Let's go, back up in the game, what's good? What's poppin?
Maejor on the stage got the whole party rocking
When they see the kid they be pulling down their stockings
Cause she know what is, yea I get the bed rocking
(Come on) Hop up in my car let me get some of that toppin
And if you don't ah, Imma look at other options
She is on my level so, she got them panties droppin
Imma beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it ain't no stoppin
Come and play with a boss, amazing of course
I'll have your eyes roll back dazed then look lost
She playing with my joystick all in my subs seater
I'm pushing on her buttons, yep, playing on her features
I never leave her cause I heard that its cheaper to keep her
So imma keep her cause I love how it feels when I freak her
Them other girls try, but it ain't the same
Cause she be up and down like a video game

[Chorus 2]
Video game lover, we should, with each
Video game lover, we, with each other
Don't act like we don't feel the same
Baby, baby, baby quit playing them games
Don't act like we don't feel the same
Baby, baby, baby quit playing them games

[Verse 2]
She was running plays, straight game like madden
Had me out my zone, wait, how did this happen?
She knew I was close to the bread like steadmen
So do it in the name of love like stephon
Let's go for a ride baby, don't be such a loser
'cause once I power up, you'll be saying that I'm super.
I don't discriminate I got young ones, I got cougars
I even got a British chick, she drive a mini cooper
Come and play with a boss, amazing of course
I'll have your eyes roll back, dazed then look lost
All up in her momma craven and kissing in the kitchen
She knew what it was, she was acting like she didn't
Pass her to my niggas man, shout out to Bei Maeger
They slate her right there, watching how to be a player
Them other girls try but it ain't the same
She be up and down like a video game

[Chorus]
Video game lover, we should, with each other
I said, video game lover, we should, with each other
Don't act like we don't feel the same
Baby, baby, baby quit playing them games
Don't act like we don't feel the same
Baby, baby, baby quit playing them games

I don't wanna play, I don't wanna play,
I just wanna get straight to the end
I don't wanna play, I don't wanna play,
I just wanna jump straight in the bed

[Chorus]
Video game lover, we should, with each other
I said, video game lover, we should, with each other
Don't act like we don't feel the same
Baby, baby, baby quit playing them games
Don't act like we don't feel the same
Baby, baby, baby quit playing them games
