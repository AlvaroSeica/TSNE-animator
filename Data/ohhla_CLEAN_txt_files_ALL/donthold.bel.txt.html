I wanna welcome you - to my train of thought
I caught you out there kinda bad
And I know you wonder why I'm peepin yo' activity
But I'll put you up to speed, yeah
Check me out

[Verse One: Brother El]
Thinking, of, love - pain - pressure
Finding, hearts, combined in minds and time it don't go fast
Knowin when one needs to catch up (catch up)
Yeah, and take time out
Find out, if you can make a difference
Please, but don't hold back
Let's face the facts..
There's responsibility in every act
How can we keep our lives on track - and overstand the facts?
And not play blind man (yeah)
You'll sick quicksand
Wonder why life is so bland?
Bet you didn't have a good plan
Please..

Don't hold back {*3X*}

Please!  Don't, hold, back - yeah
Don't hold back
Please!  Don't hold back, yeah
Don't hold back

[Verse Two: Faith]
And so I study, it gets muddy
Cloudy days, so I pray and make lovely
visions of a better world
of man, wo-man, baby boy and baby girl
Love unfurled, stickball jheri curl
playin hide'n'go-seek, promenade and twirl
New feets take a peep to the beat what you seek
in your soul so renew where you goin to
And do you like the things the world is showin you?
You, you, you and you, and all of them
But rap is just a fetus and this life will never end
Now some say that I'm wrong for bein right
And so I'm left, alone, in doubt
Rhymes with about, face, forward
March, a million, start buildin
Strong black foundation for our children..

Don't hold back {*3X*}

Please!  Don't, hold, back - yeah
Don't hold back
Please!  Don't hold back, yeah
Don't hold back

{*long interlude*}

Don't hold back {*3X*}

Please!  Don't, hold, back - yeah
Don't hold back
Please!  Don't hold back, yeah
Don't hold back</pre>
