[Intro]
haha look like I'm gettin money 
look like I got a bunch of bitches to right
look like I get every car that come the fuck out
thats what it look like nigga
look like street fam bout to take this shit over
thats what the fuck it look like 

[Fabolous]
yea yea yea yes!
looks like ya memory need refreshin
you couldn't do me if you was doin an impression
maybe I should just press charges
for swagga theft you faggots deaf
if you cant hear I'm hot as dragon's breath
nah I'm past hot I'm the sons mascot
when stacks on deck I'm at yo neck like a ascot
It's Loso she already know
so I said ok good tell that other hoe
so I say whassup son you whassup
son they say ya swagger's on Viagra keep it up
son ballin is heat we start the engine with buttons
this player be limpin call it injury struttin
these Carti lenses is somethin
get in this Benz and quit frontin
I ain't gettin no younger bitch
I ain't Benjamin Button whateva you like ???
I ain't stingy with nothin so I could dollar tip ya
or either hollow tip ya let me know...

[Chorus]
whassup son what it look like
whassup son what it look like whassup son? what it look like 
when you gettin money this is what it look like 
whassup son what it look like?
whassup son what it look like whassup son what it look like
when you gettin money this is what it look like</pre>
