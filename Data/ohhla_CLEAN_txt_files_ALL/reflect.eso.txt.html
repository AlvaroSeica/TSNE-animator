[Bliss]
Well I've been
Running round this globe for a coupla spins now
Grown from school days the outcast from the in crowd
I keep my chin down as time flies and seasons vanish
Hold the self belief to manage grip and seize my canvas
Paint the color that connects with me and speaks my language
Try to release my baggage be free to relieve the anguish
When it's freezing cold feel the warmth between my toes of this earth I walk
Creation is what feeds my soul
It can ease the load climbing on the steepest road
so I preach this ode to remind myself to keep control
When it's all too much and I dive to free fall
I try to center myself on the center of life's see-saw
I crave the fun times the sunshine entices
Of wandering temptation and unwind my vices
From the drugs to the girls and the beers I'm drinking
and remember what's at staking staring in the mirror thinking

[Chorus]
Well I've been down this road before
It's been one hell of a ride
The challenge is to balance on that fine line
Between the earth and sky
And I will wait for the morning sun till the way is clear as day
Well ok hallelujah
Now watch me take the stage
Oh a oh
Oh a oh
Oh a oh
Oh a oh (eso) yeah

It's the hunt for the high the people I've met the places I've seen (ohh)
The stories I've told the forks in the road chasing my dream (woahh)

On the brink stop and think I'm telling you dreams don't cost a thing
I know we all die alone but I feel faith within that cosmic link
I surf the starlight where every wish is worthy
Only happy when you've got it often makes you miss the journey
Coincide with chemistry
Flow and ride my energy
We'll grow our grass greener than that other side will ever be
The man on the mic the rose on my drum kit
Happy with my reflection even though I've done dumb shit
And sometimes I think of stuff keen to get that instant rush
Fiending for that pick me up that; s probably why I drink too much
It's not the feeling of the high when you're running round
It's the friends that you find when you're coming down
From smooth sailing to foggy rocky roads
I won't be faked by my reflection like that dog that dropped his bone

[Chorus]
Well I've been down this road before
It's been one hell of a ride
The challenge is to balance on that fine line
Between the earth and sky
And I will wait for the morning sun till the way is clear as day
Well ok hallelujah
Now watch me take the stage
Oh a oh
Oh a oh
Oh a oh
Oh a oh</pre>
