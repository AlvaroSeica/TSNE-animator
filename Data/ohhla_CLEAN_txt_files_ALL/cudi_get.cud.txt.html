Gimme more, uh, uhh
C'mon feel the noise, don't stop the boys,
They get wild wild wild, wild wild wild

[KiD CuDi]
Step it up, let your neck snap back
Uh, saddle up baby-girl put your hair back
Hurry up, barkeep, keep the brew comin'
Tryin' to drank 'till my back start slumpin'
Like old man, live by the old rules
Fought all the steps in front of the old fools
Got me nowhere, nigga, it's a different time
Fuck '08, niggas thinkin' '09,
I take a look behind
Niggas can't form a line
Like Kindergarten waitin' for the water fountain
Standin' up, said, arms crossed, poutin'
Scott Mescudi, boys they was doubtin' him
'Till they Googled me and found that Imeem
They love a dooder, they love me I mean
I can't believe how I had a dream of Martin King
But they ain't takin' me out on no balcony

(Feel the noise, don't stop the boys
They battle-ow-ow, wow-wow-wow)

[KiD CuDi]
Stand up, put your arms to the ceiling man
Show skin, baby-girl, yeah, I'm a fan
Won't do you wrong, like a pushover
See Cudi ridin' through, better pull over
Like I got blue, red lights shinin' 'round
But if I see the man, slowly put the club down
"How you doin' Officer? Nice mustache"
Dunkin Donut eatin' muthafuckas hatin', damn
I get my speed-racer on
Playin' Ray Cash, get my Cleveland city on
Brooklyn to Cali, jet-lagged and all
There's still enough time to hit the mall
Shit, one wish when I'm deceased
Bury me in 501's and ten deep
And please keep the bapes on the feet
So I can watch the devil ice-grill me,
Haha, yeah, how you like a nigga now?
I'm it like the clown,
And CuDi get (Wild wild wild)
I get (Wild wild wild)
Back, back up in the mix like that
How y'all feel? How y'all feel?
Y'all a'ight? That's right
And it's like that Plain-Pat, holla at me, man
Yeah!</pre>
