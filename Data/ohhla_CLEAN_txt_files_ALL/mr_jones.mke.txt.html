[Chorus]
You can ride all day long
Another Mike Diesel production (Mike Jones)
But you'll neva catch Mr. Jones (Ha ha ha ha ha haaa)
He's got a gang dat's far too strong (Ice Age, Ice Age, Ice Age)
Ya friends know it, dat's why ya all alone (Ha ha ha ha ha)
Chasin' the man you can't see (Mike Jones)
So just walk away and let him be
He's got a shotgun so go back home
(Mike Joness.. Who? Mike Joness.. Who? Mike Joness..Who?
Mike Joness.. Who? Mike Joness.. Who? Mike Joness..Who?)
'Cause you'll neva git Mr. Jones (Mike Jonesss)
 
[Verse 1]
I'm back on these tracks, 'bout to sell anutha miiill
My pants, they saggin' from dem hunned dolla biiills
These haters hate, but they don't really wanna see the steeel
These haters hate, but they don't really wanna see the steeel
Had a million in my bank befo' I signed bout the deal
Had a million in my bank befo' I signed bout the deal
Befo' I came I just say the streets wouldn't feel
The game dat I'm spittin' the shit dat's real
But now I'm like Mello', I'm The King of The Hiiill
American Dream, I'm livin' dat phureal
Eleven Corvette a playa tell me how ya feel 
The diamonds on my teeth, I put dem on my Phantom griiill (Smile, Ha haaa)
 
[Chorus]
You can ride all day long (G'yeah.. Mike Jones)

He's got a gang dat's far too strong (Ice Age, Ice Age, Ice Age)
Ya friends know it, dat's why ya all alone (Ha ha ha ha ha)
Chasin' the man you can't see (G'yeah.. Mike Jones)
So just walk away and let him be
He's got a shotgun so go back home
(Mike Joness.. Who? Mike Joness.. Who? Mike Joness..Who?
Mike Joness.. Who? Mike Joness.. Who? Mike Joness..Who?)
'Cause you'll neva git Mr. Jones (Mike Jonesss)
 
[Verse 2]
I used to git dissed by the chicks in the cluuub
Now they want to rub my belly, wanna show ya boi some luuuhv
They see me Iced Up they be like "Wussuup?"
Try to jack me if you wanna, I'ma leave you fucked upp
Used to roll hatchback now I'm Cadillacin' Benz
Used to roll hatchback now I'm Cadillacin' Benz
I used to have hommies, now I'm like fuck friendz
'Cause even back then all they did was pretend
Now I got my own label +Ice Age+ and I'm Boss!
I'm The Mayor of dis town wit' the key to dat Vault!
All my cars Black on Black 'cept the one wit' big gloss!
Got anutha White on White, I call dat ho' Rick Ross! (Ross!), Ha haaa
 
[Chorus]
You can ride all day long (Mike Jones)
But you'll neva catch Mr. Jones (Ha ha ha ha ha haaa)

Ya friends know it, dat's why ya all alone
Chasin' the man you can't see (Ya can't see me baby)
So just walk away and let him be (It's The Mayor)
He's got a shotgun so go back home

Mike Joness.. Who? Mike Joness.. Who? Mike Joness..Who?)
'Cause you'll neva git Mr. Jones
