[Intro]
This is "Royalty", bang bang

[Gonage]
I-I-I got yo' bitch layin naked 'cross the bed, no rosary
Stackin up this bread like a baker, Josephine
She want a refill so I gave that hoe a bean
Niggaz on the sideline yellin, "Who the fuck is he?"
Bitch I'm @Gonage, you can call me Codie B
Wardrobe overseas, passports all over me
White leather seats lookin like cocoa leaf
E'ry time I crank up the woofer sittin on a key
I'm Gucci buckled up, house note on my feet
Linen button-up, like I'm walkin 'round on the beach
Blind hoes notice me, in my Range Rover jeep
So they wanna +Come and Talk to Me+ like Jodeci
Smokin in the morning, and when I go to sleep
Blowin presidential man I think they about to vote for me
Any event we party like a frat, no toga sheet
If money ain't the convo, they ain't even 'posed to speak

[Chorus: Gonage]
If you ain't talkin cash, don't say shit
In the V.I.P. we champagne spray shit
I'm in the club lookin like a bank statement
If you talkin cash I can make arrangement
Walked in the club, ain't pay shit
Broke niggaz hate, cause they ain't shit
I'm gettin to the cash, pockets on payment
If you talkin money I can make arrangement
Codie

[Childish Gambino]
Codie Beanz Sr., pushin mean ether
You don't know Childish, nigga me neither~!
Eastside Atlanta, flyest nigga in a the Waffle House
If it ain't money man we ain't got shit to talk about
Kennedy compound, my 20-room house
So big my ex-girls ain't gotta move out
If you ain't talkin cash, don't say shit
Bank account lookin like when little kids break shit
"Oooooooh," if I'm breathin I can handle it
Watchin all my dreams get together like an ampersand
Blueprint the new shit, mixtape management
Show these dummies how to do it, all I want's my ten percent
Porsche brand new, passed 'em a cool hundred
Yeah my girl 5'2", even her growth stunted
It's the nigga y'all KNEW, back when I flipped meal cards
Now my meals free when I don't taste the fifth star
We can make arrangements, old money Cambridge
Meetin with the moguls, make 'em richer and they owe you
It's the kid you used to talk about, I'm watchin people get up on it
On WorldStar and I ain't have to have a nigga moment
Flow's always cold, keep the whole soul anemic
Never left that hard shit, a nigga always constipated
Got the change for my cousin on froze, no more movin weight
Flossin-flossin hard, Ice King, no more Finn and Jake
Love or hate you gotta say the hype is somethin handsome
As long as all of 'em bloggin I'm livin Richard Branson
Shit-talkers still talk, haters on my billboard
Used to take the Q home, now I hang with +Schoolboys+
So iconic, Black Kennedy this shit
Man I'm so ironic, man this ratchet need a fix
Droppin new shit, and the haters get the splashback
Don't be surprised when he ask you where the cash at

[Chorus]
