Song:   Girl I Love You
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus: x2]
Girl I love you more than anything in this whole world
your the reason that my life is so beautiful girl
Girl I need you more than the air that I breathe everyday
Please don't ever ever ever ever ever go away

[Verse 1]
Have you ever loved somebody so much
you can't sleep
Every minute by your side is like heaven to me
Babygirl everytime I look into your eyes
I wanna kiss your lips and tell you a thousand times
Your more pretty than the skies are blue
like the rays from the sun when I'm close to you
Even with all these problems we had to go through
I'll do it all once again just to be with you
Lil' mama today is your day to shine forget what everybody says this is yours and mine
All I need is your touch and your lovin' everyday
And were gonna make this last until the end of always
Invite your friend and you family too
I want the whole world to know I'm crazy for you
Forget about your problems let me make things right and let me love you girl
for life

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I knew it from my first kiss
never imagined myself feeling like this
I see forever in your eyes
you took me by surprise by the way you are
Your the wish that came true from that falling star
Your the air that I breathe and everything I need
The missing piece that completed me
And put me back together when I was under the weather
You were the melody that made me feel so better
Kisses and hugs x's and o's at the end of love letters
sweeter than a box of chocolates
Everday is valentine when I'm with you
Your my lady and I'm you rider
and I'm always gonna be right here beside you

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Please don't ever go away
(Oooooh)
Lil' mama cause I love you
(Cause I love you)
Lil' mama cause I need you
(Cause I need you
Please don't go away)</pre>
