Verse 1 [Kanye West]:
Yeezy, Ne-yo, the remix a-yo
I think it's time to hit em with the Mase flow
Mya she was gettin' The Best Of Me
But oooh child you my destiny
And I know it's especially
Hard with all these girls just testin' me (c'mon)
Uh and you gonna question me
If she even stand next to me
But you should laugh
Cause you my better half
And these girls just fightin' over the rest of me
Right now it feels so crazy
I know she just some lady
And my outfit just so 80's
Not to mention the Mclemin Mercedes
And the 26 inch rim wheels
Looks so good with your 6-inch heels
Fly shit that you be on 
Gucci on
Aligned by Louie Vuitton
And we high (hi) as the way we cruisin' on
Highlight I like Mercury
Why do I mention the solar system?
Cause you in my soul and system
And we gonna take her home wit this one
I got somethin that you gonna like
You got somethin that I can't fight
We got somethin that we both gonna right

Bridge [Ne-Yo]:
And I know this much is true
Baby, you have become my addiction
I'm so strung out on you
I can barely move but I like it

Chorus [Ne-Yo]
And it's all because of you [x3]
And it's all because...
Never get enough,
She's the sweetest drug

Verse 2 [Ne-Yo]:
Think of it every second
I can't get nothing done,
Only concern is the next time, I'm gonna get me some
Know I should stay away from, cause it's no good for me
I try and try but my obsession wont let me leave

Bridge
I got a problem and I don't know what to do about it
Even if I did, I don't know if I would quit but I doubt it
I'm taken by the thought of it, and I know this much is true
Baby, you have become my addiction
I'm so strung out on you
I can barely move but I like it

Chorus

Because of you
And it's all because of you
Never get enough
She's the sweetest drug, she's the sweetest drug</pre>
