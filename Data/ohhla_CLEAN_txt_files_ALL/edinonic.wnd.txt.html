[Intro]
Yo, pay attention
And listen real closely how I break this slang shit down

[Werd]
Check it 
If I spraf then I lie
If you ask yes is aye
If im melted im high
And if am sneaky am sly
If am drunk then am pished 
If am spewing am sick
Heroin is smack 
Got smacked you got hit (Also)
A chibs a stab a kid is a wain
Cocaine is called ching 
If its shan its a shame
If you know then you ken 
Shit a mucka's a friend
A girls a lassie ken that a womans a hen
And if you met a dirty you met a slut 
You got a gam you got sucked
And if you got a shag then you got fucked
If your ringing your soaked 
Toke or draw is a smoke
A scores a 20 note skint your broke
And if you got punched that means you got a bat
Blether's a chat 
Got leathered then your put on your back

[Werd]
I ken you like the way I'm speaking it
I talk with slang and a'l never stop speaking' it

[Nas]
Speak with criminal slang

[Werd]
And that's the way that a talk like

[Nas]
Vocabulary spills I'm ill
Speak with criminal slang

[Werd]
Its just the way that a talk like

[Nas]
Vocabulary spills I'm ill

[Werd]
Yo Ok
A roundhouse is a hook 
If a chore im a crook
Big L explained it a just switch it about like
Called names got slagged
Got caught got nabbed
If you got fucking plugged then you got stabbed
So If your raja then your crazy
A fix is a hit and a bairn is a baby
Attacked you got jumped 
Left out you got bumped
If someone's taking ages then they're taking the cunt
If a steal then a tax
My soap bar is my hash
Rapid is fast 
If we fight then we scrap
The food you eat is your scan
If am sound then am cool
If its finished its tanned
And your weapons a tool
If its shady its bad 
If your pathetic your sad
A cigarette is a fag  
And if your rageing you mad

[Werd]
I ken you like the way I'm speaking it
I talk with slang and a'l never stop speaking' it

[Nas]
Speak with criminal slang

[Werd]
And thats the way that a talk like

[Nas]
Vocabulary spills I'm ill
Speak with criminal slang

[Werd]
Its just the way that a talk like

[Nas]
Vocabulary spills I'm ill

The weed a smoke is my green 
And a fruit machine is a puggie
A minging lassie thats ugly
But if your girls stunning shes hot
Healthys a lot keep shottie you watch
A healthy swagger is the way that a walk
Talkings banner 
Good fights called a pagger
Long hard stare is you giving daggers
If you're peeving you drink 
Drink enough and get reeking
Smiling is cheesing 
If its packed then its heaving
Smelly is humming 
If am spunking am coming
Throwing is chucking 
If am dashing am running
(I run Edinburgh)
The TV is a telly 
Boyfriend am your felly
Guts your belly 
If am sorted am ready
And if you're minted then you've got loads of cash
Got away took a nash
Werd n Deek fucking class

[Werd]
I ken you like the way I'm speaking it
I talk with slang and a'l never stop speaking' it

[Nas]
Speak with criminal slang

[Werd]
And that's the way that a talk like

[Nas]
Vocabulary spills I'm ill
Speak with criminal slang

[Werd]
Its just the way that a talk like

[Nas]
Vocabulary spills I'm ill
