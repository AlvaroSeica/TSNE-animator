Yo Geezy tell these niggas' who the ballas is 

I be that playa-hata dodger 
Niggas' claim ballers, but they ain't nothin' but flodgers 
While I stay on the low, that midnight marauder 
Tryin' to get my bank account fuckin' larger 
Whatever's whatever, gotta stay clever for dat' cheddar 
But don't holler if it ain't six figures or better 
Ya' better come here with 8, cause' I'm drivin' in five 
Shine til' I die, so I strive to stay alive 
Shit you talkin' bout' fakers, nigga' I'm livin' in 7 
But you playin' with four so what the fuck you yappin' for 
Cause' me and my niggas' is always shinin' 
Lettin' niggas' know, with that fuckin' Rolex with dem' diamonds 
Twenty-one years old and I'm playin' in that Nav 
With bitches for every season, yeah we livin' lav(ish) 

We be chillin' off in Tennessee 
With 3-6 Mafia and dem' Cash Money H-B's 
A nigga' livin' his dream of regulatin' cream 
Nashville, Memphis Tenn, Mega Bucks on the scene 
Know nigga' livin' deluxe, cause' we dem' ballin' niggas' 
Went from seein' hard times to seein' six figures 
I neva' thought it could happen, unless I'm pushin' crack 
Who would a thought a Geech(ie) boy a get paid off rap 
263 we livin' major six-figurenaires 
The best broads, (ver)sace', diamonds, rollie wrist wear 
We done came along way from bein' small timers 
Now we blowin' makin' millions bein' rap rhymers 
Down &amp; Dirty, K-Rob, and dat' nigga' A-G. 
And that sniper style killer Mista O.Z(O.G.) 
And the master of metaphors dat' X-Fac(tor) 
We got the king of all ballas my nigga' T-Mac 
When I tell you we rollin', you best believe we roll 
Money so thick that we got it by the truckload 
Keep yo eye on your girl, you bet not let me get her 
Cause' you ain't gon' get that bitch back once the Bucks hit her 
I done told you before that I be livin' deluxe 
While you hatin' in the cut 
I'm steady comin' up 
I make moves that you fake niggas' dream about 
I'm that nigga' in the bed yo' wife scream about 
While you lickin' on the pussy nigga' you suckin' my dick 
So i'mma shine and bigtime on you playa-hating tricks 
Now you tell me nigga' 

Who the ballas nigga'? 
Can't fuck with none of us 
Yo money ain't big enough, thats why you hatin' us 
Who the ballas nigga'? 
263, shinin' and bigtymin' makin' moves for the money 
Who the ballas nigga'? 
Yeah we made niggas' big-ballin' and shot-callin' 
Live and die for six figures 
Who the ballas nigga'? 
Open your eyes I know you see 
T-Mac done made it funky, nigga' 263 

A yo it's ridiculous, the way we pass you by life vehicular 
Navigators on chrome, big-bodies 
The entourage loaded with felons and misdemeanor 
Showin' up short shit 
Jump out the Yuk' like sub-zero and froze your shit 
Yeah iced out what rollies and all 
Candy-coats, 18's, prowlers and all 
Nigga' thats how we rollin' yall know we ballin' 
Pick up some gats and watch yall niggas' start stallin' 
Cartier eyewear, slick gators, 
black lacs stink lincs, pussy in the pink 
What the fuck I'mma freak 
Plus we smokin' that shit to put your dick in the dirt 
So when its time to go to work, I put my dick in her skirt 
After I nut, I say fuck dem' bitches, fuck dem' stank-ass hoes 
Tryin' to monkey wrench my plan, so my mo's wont roll 
But I get in and hit 16, burn rubber then jet motto 
And a flashlight photo, while the sun flip my candy-coats 
No probes, one hundred spokes effects be reversal 
263 clique universal, well rounded 
Now take it how it sounded 
And why you dumbfounded 
????? is how this clique here be bonded 
A yo we keep it cock for all my niggas' on lock 
A yo we smoke an o' for all my niggas' on parole 
So you know its to be sold and not told 
We bout' to shine and unfold, and break this fuckin' mold 

Now I'm playin' in my Hum-vees 
These hoes wanna see T-Mac they gotta come to that S. C. 
Now I'm all about my bitches 
I spark niggas' like blunts who try to get up on my riches 
Now you know I shine all day long 
Twenty-inch rims, candy on that Navi, nigga' I stay on 
Spark the shit up for my niggas' 
We goin' to the top Iced out nigga' makin' six figures 
Top notch to the fullest 
You fuck with my 263 niggas', you gonna bite a bullet 
I got geezy in that Navi, K-Rob in the EX-p 
Me and bucks in that Bentley, X-Fac nigga' Yukon 
I got O.Z. out yesterday a hundred thousand dollar bond 
Now you see my Baby Bone, he's in that jaguar on his way home 
He got that Rolex on 
Twenty-karat rock diamonds 
Twenty round' my wrist ten round my neck nigga' steady climbin' 

Who the ballas nigga'? 
Can't fuck with none of us, can't fuck with none of us 
Yo money ain't big enough, thats why you hatin' us 
Who the ballas nigga'? 
263, shinin' and bigtymin' makin' moves for the money 
Who the ballas nigga'? 
Yeah we made niggas' big-ballin' and shot-callin' 
Live and die for six figures
