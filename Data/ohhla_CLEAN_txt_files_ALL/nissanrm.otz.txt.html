[Chorus: Joell Ortiz]
Nissan, Honda, Chevy, Nissan, Honda, Chevy, Nissan, Honda, Chevy
My stash is never empty baby
Nissan, Honda, Chevy, Nissan, Honda, Chevy, Nissan, Honda, Chevy
The-the d's will never get me

[Verse One: Joell Ortiz]
In my hoopty I be swurvin, the public who I'm servin
Boost phones forever chirpin I be out there puttin work in
Know them dirty boys lurkin If they nab me then it's curtains
So when I'll go see a person I spend the blocks so I'm certain
That it's cool, I'm no fool, see Raul is bored and reckless
So I meet him when it's busy at that Meek or Morgan exit
Off that BQ B-B-B-B-B-B-BQE near Mickey D's
And occasionally treat myself to a nice little fish and cheese
I'm really really in the street, being broke's my enemy
Teachers said I'm dumb but I dropped out and I know chemistry
I make that soft get hard, and meet my homey Pito
In the parkin lot of Home Depot off Northen Boulevard
I got my route down packed, I'm about my stacks
And my mouth don't chat I let my 'bout 'bout clap
But I ain't with that though I'm tryin to get that dough
Beamer, Benz or Bentley oh no I stay low in that

[Chorus: Joell Ortiz] (Jim Jones)
Nissan, Honda, Chevy, Nissan, Honda, Chevy, Nissan, Honda, Chevy
(Hey Ortiz! I know a nigga that could put a stash on anything, on my mama)
My stash is never empty baby
Nissan, Honda, Chevy, Nissan, Honda, Chevy, Nissan, Honda, Chevy
(Hey y'all know I had to jump on this, you know I stay low, tinted up Jones)
The-the d's will never get me

[Verse Two: Jim Jones]
I remember gettin soup when I first had the Acc (I remember)
It was the nine seven Coupe I didn't know how to act
When Juju did the stash the body shop on Jerome (Seven Fourth)
Way before the boost I had the flip mobile phone (Right)
Before that it was the beeper, had one Streetsweeper
We all cut class so we hardly knew the teacher
When The Rink was really hot (Alright) rockin minks was really hot (I remember)
We was on the car waggers wasn't thinkin about a drop (OK)
Now I scoop you in the charger drop you off in the 'ghini
Let you out on the corner right before your boyfriend see me (And)
Keep a low vehicle (Right) when I'm low speedin through
And I'm sccopin up your hoe they don't know that it is you (Jones)
Used to watch my uncle do it (Yeah) scoop 'em up in the Buick (And)
One chick Delores turned fiend she was gorgeous (Where?)
Speakin about cars I think we still got a Taurus
I ain't 'gon mention 'bout the color 'cause it's still takin orders (FUCKER!!!! GO!!!)

[Chorus: Joell Ortiz] (Jim Jones)
Nissan, Honda, Chevy (And) Nissan, Honda, Chevy (And) Nissan, Honda, Chevy (And)
My stash is never empty baby
(I, I hope you got your registration, you, you know)
Nissan, Honda, Chevy, Nissan, Honda, Chevy, Nissan, Honda, Chevy
(I used to get a bitch to get me runnin and still put tinteds on that mu'fucker!!!) 
The-the d's will never get me</pre>
