I'm comin
(Here I come girl, here I come girl)
I'm comin for you
(Here I come girl, here I come girl, here I come)
You can run and hide, there's nothing you can do

(It's real tonight, let's start the show
And turn the lights down low)
Girl, I'm captured by your radiance
(You're the sunshine of any man's life
Can you be my girl or my wife?)
The way you make me feel inside is so intense
(( ? ) of the world around
The way you're penetratin my heart ( ? ))
I've held back but now it's getting late
(You know how it is, sometimes you chill
When the time is right I will)
But they say that good things come to those who wait
(Patience is a virtue
If that's a fact, I'm gonna get you)
When you're feelin kinda down girl then I can build you up
(Word
Word)
When you're feelin empty, come around girl and let me fill you up

I'm comin
(Here I come girl, here I come girl)
I'm comin for you
(Here I come girl, here I come girl, here I come)
You can run and hide, there's nothing you can do
(Here I come girl, here I come girl)

Girl you know I want you so bad
(I don't play no games, but if I did
For you I'd make my highest bid)
The way you say my name just drives me mad
(Like music to the savage beast
Your voice it brings me peace)
Ease your mind and throw away your pride
(Put your pride all to the side
You don't need no money for the love ride)
It's alright, don't fight those things you feel inside
(Listen up you sexy thing
You feel like a queen cause I'm the king)
Maybe I just try to tease you, oh baby, I don't know, don't know
(Word
Word)
Girl I only wanna please you and I'm good to go

I'm comin

I'm comin
(Here I come girl, here I come girl)
I'm comin for you
(Here I come girl, here I come girl, here I come)
You can run and hide, there's nothing you can do
(Here I come girl, here I come girl, here I come girl)
The things that you feel inside
(Here I come girl, here I come girl)
I'm comin
I'm comin for you
(Here I come girl, here I come girl, here I can)
Oh girl
You can run and hide, there's nothing you can do
I got get right next to you
I'm comin</pre>
