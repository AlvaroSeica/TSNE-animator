Song:   Thinkin Bout Cops
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

As the sun going down I'm thinking to myself
If this life is my heaven, why am I going through hell?
And if there's nothing at all then only time will tell
So I try to make money with these drugs that I sell
They try to put me in jail and police fine me
Can't smoke (something), you know I gotta be free
I know that drinking and driving lead to DUI
So I try to stay sober I'm driving this high?

Thinking bout cops and then one passes by
Don't mean I got some fuckin' psychic mind
Looking for life before it passes by
When the time comes I will be ready to die
And I won't love them once more, they try to kill you
Thinking of shit, you know they cannot refuse

They mark up on letters to inscribe me
The girls that you know I will never find
Girls on the street ain't like the ones in my mind
And now I speak to my brother cause he speak the truth
When I like it girl, I'll fuckin' bust in two?</pre>
