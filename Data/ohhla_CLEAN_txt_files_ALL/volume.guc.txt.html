[Intro]
{"Just Blaze" *echoes*}
Gucci... it's Gucci
Okay lemme get my paper out
Get my paper out

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
I'm so motherfuckin turned up right now (volume)
Someone please turn Gucci Mane down (volume)
Brick Squad thugged out, we don't give a fuck (volume)
We hit the club, shoot the club, tear the club up (volume)
So you should hit the flo', get low, or shut up (volume)
Hit the flo', get low, and shut the fuck up (volume)
Youse a bitch, youse a snitch, youse a motherfuckin scrub (volume)
Youse a bitch, youse a snitch, youse a motherfuckin scrub (volume)

[Gucci Mane]
I pulled up in a four door Porsche set trippin
Three young dread head niggaz ridin with me
I don't think they like me, and I don't like 'em neither
But if they move wrong I'll red up they wifebeater
I do it for the hood, I do it ain't no equal
I do it for the red, black, yellow, white people
I just bought a kay, just the other day
And I don't play with grown men I don't like to play
I'm so motherfuckin turned up right now
Niggaz hatin on me, I don't give a fuck right now
Well you niggaz keep on tryin like the little engine that could
You thank you could, you thank you can, I thank you pussies should

[Chorus]

[Gucci Mane]
Call me Gucci Flocka Flame, I done changed my name
Call me Frenchy Mane LaFlare, Guc' the Kid, it's all the same
I be runnin gunning stuntin with a hundred killers ridin
You snitchin bitchin tattletellin scared to stand beside me
I just bought another house, just to house my goons
So Icey Entertainment, boy we just like a platoon
The colors in my chain remind me of a cartoon
I'll merk your boy in March, they don't find that boy 'til June
(Well damn!) I wish they found him August so that's like too much too soon
(Wow) His face was swoll and puffy about the color of a prune
(Well damn!) Brick Squad movement and no you're not a part of it
Me, Waka and Wooh, Juice and Frenchie Mane started it

[Chorus]

[Wooh Da Kid]
Iced out crib got me ballin like the lakers
Homicide around the corner when you in Jamaica
My volume on max, you boys better run
I'ma nigga with a attitude, holdin on the gun
Seventeen niggaz I left sixteen hit
Last nigga hit the corner got his whole head split
Told you you a goner, I'ma leave you dead quick
I'm like asalaam alaikum, left him bakin dead prick
Wooh Da Kid thugged out, he don't give a fuck
Let your soul meet the sole of the bottom of my Chucks
Black car, black tints with the big tags
Stay low to the flo' my midget out bag
My midget out the bag

[Chorus]
