I see your face in the winter scarred in the snow
I have your teeth marks on my neck
two perfect holes
Flowers tend to die when you walk past through 'em
Hearts tend to die when you carve right through 'em
My white oleander she stays in my garden
A couple feet on top of my ready made coffin
She's the angel, dressed in white
The horns come alive when she turns out the lights

She's alive!
She never sleeps!
She will destroy you
My white oleander

She plays with her hearts
She always sits on her hands
Opposites attract like the ying and the yang
Tempted by the temptress, the evil vixen
Slithers with her forked tongue open ears listen
Feel the fire
burning beside you
Let it destroy you
Don't look back
Swallow the poison
give her your love
Drown in her river
Take your last breath
Caught up in her web and she's not letting go
You're caught up in her rapture and your death will come slow
Rest your head
and go to sleep
Goodnight
Sweet dreams

She's alive!
She never sleeps!
She will destroy you
My white oleander</pre>
