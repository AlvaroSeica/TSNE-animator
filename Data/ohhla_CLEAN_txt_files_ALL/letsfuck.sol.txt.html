Typed by: Cno Evil

[Chorus 2X: male singer]
Let's fuck... until the sun come up
We can skip the breakfast, baby
I just wanna fuck you, baby

[Solomon Childs]
I got 'em screaming, aoow, slow down daddy
Don't hurt the cootie, when I'm hitting that spot
So you a big girl, and you can take it all in your mouth
No disrespect, believe me, I ain't trying to diss you
I'm trying to kick it with you
Cuz what's good goose, shit, good for the gander
And we all got dirty clothes in the hamper
And I'mma Scorpio, I just want a freak anyway
Without the buddah and the Hennessey, baby
Blowing the pineapple, while you getting head
Switch, have you blowing the pineapple, while you getting licked all around the edge
Beauty marks all over your body
Never mind the hobbies, sweat, mami
Romance is whatever it takes, I need full-time to work on back cakes

[Chorus 2X]

[Solomon Childs]
Animalistic attractions, and after the sex drive
You gon' need more than aspirins, how you feel about
A weekend in passion, sweat dripping, nothing but actin
I like 'em with the complexion strawberry
And whipped cream, butterscotch and honey
Coco with the tattoo on your tummy
Satisfaction, so it could never get dry
Got the KY jelly for all those other requests
And replies and let me ease your mind
This casanova, ain't never been a one minute brother
The pipe game exotic, I'll be your ultimate lover
Baby you think I'm juicy like a California cherry
How you feel about doggy style?
Hitting real wild, like Billy Bob Thorton
And Halle Berry, take a look at me now

[Chorus 4X]

[Hook 2X: male singer]
Forever, and ever, ever, and ever
Ever, and ever, always...</pre>
