[Sean Price]
Let's go, listen
Stuck in a jam - why you wanna fuck with me, fam?
I'm tryin to live a square life, you wanna fuck up my plan
Under a bus fucker, I'll throw you under a van
Throw the van in reverse and then I'll do it again
Grand theft auto, the man with the sket also
two turntables, a tec that'll touch torsos
P, niggaz thinkin that the family sweet
Run up on Ruck you'll get beat with hands and feet nigga
Kimbo Slice and a slice of Jim Kelly
Thing go pop and then enter your thin belly
Fuck bein humble, I'm better than everybody
Melancholy niggaz get hit with a heavy shottie
Dumb fuckers don't know how the rules go
Young pups can't fuck with the Cujo
... You bark better than your bite
Yeah I bark, but I'm better when I fight - P!!

Some of the nicest niggaz in the game is friends
If I do a song with 'em then the friendship'll end
Sore loser, spittin the raw at y'all Rugers
Bet niggaz frauds like Jean Claude in broad bluest
East coast niggaz, west coast niggaz
I eat most niggaz with the sket close nigga
P!! I make you mad you livin
Fuckin with Sean Price, that's a bad decision
I was once fucked up, from the ash I risen
A lot of, fights almost got slashed in prison
I had money on my head, you can ask my imam
This rap is a, actual fact that's written
I'll fuck a nigga up but if cash is given
I will split a nigga head, call it bad division
P! I dismember your memory homes
