[Intro: Buddha Monk]
Ladies and gentlemen, I wanna thank ya'll for coming out tonight
On this night, we want ya'll to drink straight shots of Henny and Ali'
Haha, cuz tonight is one of the special nights
We got one of Albany's greatest on this mic, tonight
Ladies and gentlemen, give it up for Mr. Q, come on

[Q]
Here's the jack of all trades
Chillin' with my baby in the gangsta lean
She's, the only girl that I want
She keeps a nigga hard, when I'm seeing them lumps
Lumps, lumps, lumps
What's a true player gotta do
To keep this thing, poppin' with you
I don't live by the code of a stud
But I do what I do, to give a nigga what she wants
She got me busting like a three eighty
I got to scrill, like these the last days
And I love her cuz she had my baby

[Chorus: Buddha Monk (Q)]
Rhyming in the park, chilling in the dark
Dealin with the girl and the gangsta lean
(That's what a true player do
I want you to understand what I'm saying to you)
Rhyming in the park, chilling in the dark
Dealin with the girl and the gangsta lean
(That's what a true player do
That's why I roll with this song and I'm saying it to you)

[Q]
Not bad to the bone, but I'm bad when I bone
Wants my caramel soon as I come home
I'm like a big kid with a ice cream cone
So sprinkle me babe, lick me off the bone
I lived the life of a gangsta life
Albany, New York, where we keeps it live
Smoke trees, sip drinks, shoot dice
High six, or more six, four or nine

[Chorus]

[Q]
I'm a thug and you my lady
If you feeling me, then sing this baby
Nanana, nanana
Nananananana, nananananana
Nanana, nanana
Nananananana...

[Chorus]</pre>
