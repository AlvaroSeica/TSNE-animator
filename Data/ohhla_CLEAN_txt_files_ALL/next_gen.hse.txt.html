[Verse One] [Blueprint]
I'm sayin'...
A lot of thangs change
Fades and slang change
Clothes and change change
Back in the day bangin' Slick Rick and Dana Dane
Airbrush jackets, fat laces, name plates
Gold has come and gone, now platinum chains hang
A Dee with white tees all rockin' the same thang
Gazelles and finger waves to dreads and stunter shades
Went from G. Rap &amp; Kane to Kanye &amp; Lil' Wayne
I was a shorty then, I couldn't even stay up late
Still caught the bug when David Bowie sang of fame
Went from Reganomics, full black in '88
To Dre and The Chronic, red and blue to gang bang
Big ass computers, punch cards and mainframes
Now a little microchip can do all the same thangs
It's more modern now, I'm tryin' to maintain
It's all behind me now but things still seem strange
It's been a couple of years
But Greenhouse is still here
Had to figure out where we go from here but when I looked at the past it was crystal clear
I'm talkin' VCRs, Betamax, VHS
High buyer TDKs and grey Maxell cassettes
Now it's Netflix, TiVo and On-Demand
The death of the daily paper, get your news on the net
CDs, they 'bout to be gone next
It's all about your cell phones and Bluetooth headsets
Used to have the fliest Walkman
Now my Iphone give me GPS directions while I'm walkin'
Went from member's only, Lee jeans and Izod
To ?, Evisu jeans and Ipods
We used to actually sit down and write letters
Now it's all Facebook, Myspace, Twitter
Larry Bird, Magic Johnson, Michael Jordan
Kobe Bryant, King James, Tim Duncan
If you livin', you gotta love it
The shit you feel the most is the shit you never saw comin'</pre>
