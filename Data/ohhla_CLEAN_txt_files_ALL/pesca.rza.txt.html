Aww yeah, pescatarian baby
WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS?
Well let me drop some truth on yo' ass right now

The vegetarian lifestyle is healthy as a f#%k
To my four-legged homies, no reason to duck
But you fin-f#%ks, got this emcee gunning
Meat is murder, but the fish had it coming
Omega 3 fatty acids run deep
But don't sleep - the price you pay is too steep
I never seen a fish who ain't a punk-ass bitch!
High mercury, killin my brothers and s#%t!!
Got a hot yacht, that's a stone cold killer
Make these fish fly still as Ben Stiller ("Hi!")
Harpoons in the front, harpoons in the back
Now that f#%king fish momma, she's dressed in black
Every Chicken of the Sea gonna need an escape pod
Watch me turn Cape Cod into Rape Cod!
I dick yo' mouth, gonna make a fine parent
Psych! That was a f#%king red herring

POP, POP, POP
Call me a POP, POP, POP, pescatarian
POP, POP, POP
Steve Jobs f#%k POP, POP, POP, pescatarian
POP, POP, POP
Then cuff me - POP, POP, POP, fried fish
POP, POP, POP
{*choking on fish*} Damn f#%king fishbone! F#%k!
