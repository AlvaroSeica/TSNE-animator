Yeah, yeah, yeah
Back in bright light!

Hey yo, I don't really cry
Ask why?
Cause inside no one ever really dies
Your presence is still alive
Your voice I still hear it
I still feel your spirit in a room
Feel heavenly with the scent of you
It wasn't only issues
But couldn't help but notice your views
So many aspects of truth!
In fact you let the past get to you
So thoughts on a better future
It couldn't suit you alone!
We was stoned by the snakes of this life of sin
But you taught me a lifeless end to fight within
Use the power of our minds
I was confused at some hour in time
My eyes were dark, probably blind
But, now I see even the sunshines through blinds
And now I moving light in the sightings that I find
Enticing in my prime, like, look at me now
You used to tell me, "read books!"
Niggas booking me now!
But how, could I have done it without you though?
You was the big bro I never ever had, you know?
Why you had to go and hurt me inside?
I feel guilty walking down outside with false pride
If only we could vibe like, one more time
Hear one more line or share one more rhyme
Even show me one more sign of destiny yourself would be fine
But there's no turning back the hands of time,
Or delaying the plans of your mastermind
So I hope you came across of what you had to find
And watch over the ones you once loved!
You was my nigga, we pushed...

One love, yeah, yeah, yeah
One love!
One love!
One love!

The sky's the limit
That's what they told the fucking fool!
I disguised the limit
Now I'm aiming for the sun and moon
The sky's the limit
That's what they told the fucking fool!
I disguised the limit
Now I'm aiming for the sun and moon.

Long Live Steelo!
Yo, yo, yo, yo
93 till infinity
Yo, yo, yo, yo
