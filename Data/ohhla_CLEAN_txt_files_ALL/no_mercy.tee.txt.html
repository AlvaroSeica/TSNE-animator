[Chorus: The-Dream]
There's no mercy for me
No crying myself to sleep
No mercy for me
Nightmares have become my dreams
No mercy for me
Good morning reality
Will I wake? We'll never know!
I'm late for my date with destiny, let me go! {*echoes*}

[The-Dream]
Let me go! {*echoes*}
You gotta let me go! {*echoes*}
Right or wrong, let me go! {*echoes*}
I'm on my path, let me go! {*echoes*}

[T.I.]
My momma love me more than I do, she say, "Your pop was just like you"
Trapped in a vicious cycle, Jesus' youngest disciple
Tell the judge if he throw the book at me make it the Bible
Start callin myself the king for lack of a better title
Loyal beyond belief to my detriment, it's so vital
I change or blow opportunities like a choir recital
Now while I'll not care who tell it
Meanwhile sellin powder puts food in the bellies
Well it's, unfortunate the orphanage couldn't keep up the mortgages
Kid go to school stupid, they teachers ignorin it
Sorta just doomed, forced into bein a goon
Sell the kush in a jar, mix a {?} and a balloon
Consumed with the same way of life I left
Everything I know now learned by myself
All you see is the wealth, the Maseratis, Ferraris
So they don't sympathize, don't nobody feel sorry
No mercy

[Chorus]

[T.I.]
Everybody's standin and waitin, chantin and hatin
Gospel say they should forgive me, they'd rather hand me to Satan
Blatant displays the day of hypocrisy, boy you got to be
kiddin, could it be possibly second comin of 'Pac is me?
Remember that? When he was here?
And when he died you realize you need him here
God with me partner, ain't no one for me to fear
Hindsight, 20/20, future not as clear
But I'm a rider 'til I die, put bullets 'tween my eye
I j-ust ask I can make my peace with God and say goodbye
Fuck up the world like Lady Di on the day he died
His wife, his sons and daughters know that every day he tried
to be a better person, all they want is better verses
they can market to the merchants, but when the closed curtains
Ay, you could be for certain ain't nobody perfect
But when you're rich nobody give a shit, no mercy

[Chorus]

[The-Dream]
You gotta let me go! {*echoes*}
Gotta let me go! {*echoes*}
Let me go! {*echoes*}
Let me go! {*echoes*}</pre>
