[Verse Four: Ghostface]
YO! I know a couple of real killers that's Catholic
White boys that speed blacks cleanin they ratchets
In the bloodline it's Irish, I'm the only Muslim in the pool
They know I put that work in like a pirate
Jails you slap the ox in the green jello
Carvin your face is like the sound of a sweet demo
Swiss knives and timid they roscoe
Blood drippin over my crisp Nike's
The streets the teks spit like tobasco
Never sip the blue shit or pink Rose'
That's more for like pretty women, you so lame
So if you wanna get physical
Staten Island goons is in the cut
Tony Starks play the front like my genitials

[Interlude: Swizz Beatz] (Busta Rhymes) (*DMX)

[Verse Five: DMX]
I went away for a minute, it's like I'm back from the dead (YEA!)
Relapse on you niggas, and crack some heads (AIGHT!)
Lemme see - my plate's empty, yours is full
You suck, real talk, C'MON with the bull!
Guns clap like applause (YEA!!), tap tap on the doors (YEA!!)
You gon' be like, "What's that??!," all you gon' hear is BAP!! thru the walls (YEA!!)
