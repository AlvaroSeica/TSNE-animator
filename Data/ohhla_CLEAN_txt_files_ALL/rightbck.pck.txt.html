Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse: Stunna]
yea, if you blink I can make ya eyes roll back
sit on 4 flats, better get where you goin to
In the game so the chicks think I'm rich now
see me in my phone, yea bitch I drink crystal
don't trip cause stunna got a pistol
hatas gettin mad an they seen that I'm pissed now
gimme 12 rats, we can switch trains like a frieght train, like a big plane
got bay game, I'm a hood nigga
yea you alright, but I'm good nigga
like to sit back, watchin ass shake
like to beat it raw, then gimme face
no gimme taste no boogers sugar
b rock the place, yea I took the lookers
got a mini skirt look like a hooker
queen get a crew, yea now we took ya

[Chorus]
bring it right back I know you heard dat
bring it right back lemme hurt dat
bring it right back I know you heard dat
bring it right back lemme hurt dat

[Verse: Young L]
I'm on the grind yea fuck you pay me
young l hoe, bitch go crazy
you like to laugh huh? go chuckle
l smith game tall like a turn buckle
power bomb ya ass, go figure
faced in the basement big tigger
hoes bring em over here on the mattress
b-town on the map, check the atlas
raw at this, money on my mind
dick in her mouth, I tell her I'm gettin money nigga
you a funny nigga sip ski bummy nigga
you ain't shit bitch, I'm a big tummy nigga
candy bar sweet niggas spit sugar
green in the mouth ice grill, boogers
pair of vans free, niggas got prada

[Chorus]

[Verse: Droop-E]
(yes ma'am) why they call me droop-e? nobody knows
cause when I pull it out it grows and it grows and it grows
hoes know I'm a pro when I hit it
I'm sick wit it, lutienent up in it
I'm fitted, fresh lookin grape
you niggas hatin cause you fake like ya bapes
I'm great, hoes move they drinks when they hear my chains shake
me and b slim man, wit the wolf pack
hoe take ya pants off, show ya ass crack
we showin no mercy, I'm touchin more hoes the a football jersey
I'm still gon feel an I'm still gone kill
I'm a droop e pill, I'm her drug of choice... thats why that bitch high like chris tucker voice

[Chorus]</pre>
