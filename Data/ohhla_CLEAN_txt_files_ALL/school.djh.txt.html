[Black Attack]
One two
What the fuck going on?
Black Attack, AMV
'98 worldwide
Knamsayin, knamsayin?
You 'bout to take a ride through the town
Some wild shit son
Word up, hold on

Yo, let me clear my throat like DJ Clue
Set it off for my niggas who be actin fool
Blackattack 'em, have they techniques on hold
Shut 'em down at the end where there's pots of gold
Let me dilly, dally, hit this alley
Puff an L with sally or this chronic from Cali
Wilin, comin straight from Rosevelt Island
Thats how it is, dog nobodies smilin
Always on some cool out, neva get upset
Flow all over the track get my dough to step
They call me Blackattack I rep the AMV
And one thing I hate is a weak emcee
I gets it, going off, cuz I'm up next to flex
You bet I'm coming through, shit be rough like sex
Positive, and watch ya toes tap to this
And Blackattack make 'em clap to this

Chorus: [Black Attack]

Aiyyo, Old school, New school need to learn'o
I burn baby burn like disco inferno
Burn like disco inferno
I said I burn like disco inferno
Old school, New school need to learn'o
I burn baby burn like disco inferno
Burn like disco inferno
I said I burn like disco inferno

[Black Attack]
I be ya idol, the highest title, numero uno
Bigger nigga, break cats down like Frank Bruno
You know, new kid on the block rip tracks up
Check out my melody and the way I twist sacks up
I was fiend at the age of seventeen
Cash Rules Everything Around Me, CREAM
Wait a minute, ha, slowdown baby
I'm on a rampage for dough now baby
Sometimes I wonder what'choo lookin for
Can a ill rapper make money any more?
If you tired cousin, go take a nap
If you rappin outta place then you will get smacked
Got thirty songs ready and I still want more
Kinda fallen ??? black four door
Always calm under pressure, don't need to act shook
Listen when I tell you boys...

Chorus (With Variations)

[Black Attack]
Now look, in this corner we have the raw buddha blazer
You bettin for ya style dog I raise ya
Double, confident, my shit on point
I got godfather trees while you rollin a joint
I know y'all wonderin, is black paid?
I'm broker than a motherfucka tryin to save
Cuz I ain't got cash, I can't flow neither
Kick ya best flow and I'll make you a believer
I live with rap, die with rap
Talk with rap, walk with rap, smoke with rap
Eat with rap, I do my thing and thats that
I don't think niggas fucking with the Blackattack
Smack the back of a neck of a wack emcee
I don't fuck with the crack, I smoke cranberry
Nigga please, all I'm tryin to do is get cheese
And own land in the sand in the West Indies

Chorus (With Variations)

[Black Attack]
To all the old school veter-ans
EMPD, Rakim, Redman, Special Ed
KRS-One, no doubt, what what
Old school, New School
Real deal nigga, word up</pre>
