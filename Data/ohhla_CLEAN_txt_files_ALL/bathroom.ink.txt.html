Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Yeah, uh
Everybody follow me
Back home, its a afterparty; full of bad hoes
Bunch of drink, grass smoke
You can do them other drugs in the bathroom
Follow me, back home, its a afterparty; full of bad hoes
Bunch of drink, grass smoke
You can do them other drugs in the bathroom

Cuz I'm tryna keep it on the low girl
Breezy, and I'm livin in a cold world
Try to get in, gotta know the code word
And I'll take one, but girl you gotta go first
Whole room movin like a lava lamp
Club full of bad girls, no oxygen
And you know it's goin down, and thats that
Cuz we on the blunt, you gotta pass that
We don't smoke those, you can ask that
I'm in the bathroom hidin from cash stacks
Dro's here but I'ma need a cap back
I got my money right, since you comparin that

Follow me, back home, its a afterparty; full of bad hoes
Bunch of drink, grass smoke
You can do them other drugs in the bathroom
Follow me, back home, its a afterparty; full of bad hoes
Bunch of drink, grass smoke
You can do them other drugs in the bathroom
(Dj Rockstar)

I got they hands up, like a classroom
Can't see me like I got a mask on
Girls straight off the cover of Maxim
It's snow bunnies here, like we in alaska
White girls, dike girls
And she told you that she don't even like girls
Lyin ass, I make that kitty purr
Since you can bring it back, go on hit reverse
It ain't no dirt knees, land mines
Gotta blend in, camoflauge
You trippin girl, this ain't a altoid
But it got me feelin like a cocaine cowboy

Follow me, back home, its a afterparty; full of bad hoes
Bunch of drink, grass smoke
You can do them other drugs in the bathroom
Follow me, back home, its a afterparty; full of bad hoes
Bunch of drink, grass smoke
You can do them other drugs in the bathroom

Money on my mind, what the fuck should I be thinkin bout
Purple drank and two styrophones is what I'm drinkin out
The party's poppin, as well as pills
I'm geeked bitch, the whole damn party's outta control
I'm in the bathroom with a freak bitch
Gudda hoe, yea that's my name
Don't look at me, look at my chain
Walk in the party, shut down the party then pile the hoes in the black Range
All black tires, I'm the bat man
In the batmobile, doors up bat wings
I get a lot of money, what are you doin
The hoes think I'm crazy, couple screws loose and
I party hard, we ain't sleepin till next afternoon
So follow me and swallow me it's a party in the bathroom

Follow me, back home, its a afterparty; full of bad hoes
Bunch of drink, grass smoke
You can do them other drugs in the bathroom
Follow me, back home, its a afterparty; full of bad hoes
Bunch of drink, grass smoke
You can do them other drugs in the bathroom</pre>
