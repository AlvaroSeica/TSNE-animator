[Intro]
Alright. We gonna build a foundation from here
They told me I had to return with some heat. Step up
It's time to step it up. Supastition

[Chorus]
Now step up and get with it
Step up and get with it
Now step up and get with it
Step up and get with it
Step up and get with it
Now step up and get with it
Now step up, step, step, step up
Step up, now step up and get with it
Now step up and get with it [x5]
A one, two, a one, two

[Verse One]
Now let me introduce myself
I'm Mr. Bad Luck, yep I paid dues
Been here forever, y'all just slept on my debut
I've been kept on labels and learned when you get dealt a hand
Full of bullshit you play with it like Elton Brand
Just when you thought urban music was dead
I resurface with the purpose of provin' I'm never losin' my edge
This Carolina cat flows infinite
My brain's like Korean food, nobody knows what's it in
Bringin' the drama to my team is like sparkin' a gas fire
Cause I run with a regime the size of a mass choir
I'm the champion, I march around town victorious
Leavin' you nervous like you blew lights on Crown Victorias
My crew, we make rappers kiss the ground before us
The underground notorious, put your crown in storages
These cats ain't movin' toward us
I make niggas fans by the second bar
Turn 'em to groupies before the chorus
Step it up

[Chorus]
Step up and get with it
Step up and get with it
Step up and get with it
Now step up and get with it [x4]
Now step up, step, step, step up
Step up, now step up and get with it
Now step up and get with it [x5]
Now step up, step, step, step up

[Bridge] [x2]
Now hurry hurry, step right up
Let me tell you what I do to y'all
Cause I'll smash any MC, soloist or group
We can even get your crew involved

[Verse Two]
Whoever said that niggas from the south can't rhyme
Got another thing comin' cause brother I bring thunder
I'm toxic
I do not fit the stereotypes
I'm just the opposite, the hottest shit you hear in your life
I'm not infatuated with chains so I snatch your respect
While your half a dollar ass is still attached to the check
I am
Supastition, rank as one of the best today
Yes the S.U.P.A.
Go head and press the replay
Cause me and M-Phaze we blaze with chemistry
As different as night and day but still praise with infamy
An I-Tunes constructed for the grittiest streets
Floodin' your city with heat, the way I spit on these beats
It's so ill
With so many MCs, you've probably seen a million
But I'm the main attraction like the backside of Serena Williams
Better yet, Vivica Fox
Deliver different hip hop
Can you get with it or not?
Just step it up man

[Chorus]
Step up and get with it
Step up and get with it
Step up and get with it
Now step up and get with it [x4]
Now step up, step, step, step up
Step up, now step up and get with it
Now step up and get with it [x5]
Now step up, step, step, step up

[Verse Three]
I put my heart into my verses
You can feel when I'm close
Some people say they touch the vinyl and feel my pulse
In every rhyme you find player I'm no joke
And every line is dope, potent as a line of coke
One sniff and you can die from the words and instrumentals
It's not coincidental, I rock your residential 
Hip hop is detrimental but vital for me to breathe
I'm tryin' to push my name up there with the EPMDs
I'd rather be established
I'm not tryin' to walk away having a contract with less points than Joc Vaughn's season average
That ain't happenin', I'll hold somebody captive
Before I let somebody fuck me over on this rap shit
Critics consider me a three and a half, that's alright
To get a five I'd probably need some knee pads
I don't believe in brown nosin' for a little recognition
I'm a classic
That's the true and livin' definition
Supastition y'all</pre>
