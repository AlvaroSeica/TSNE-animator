[Intro/Chorus: Travis Scott]
I'm riding up uptown (WHOO)
I'm a motherfucking monster (WHOO)
One hand on the wheel, one hand on my dick
I'm a motherfucking monster (WHOO)
You riding up uptown (WHOO)
One hand on the wheel one hand my dick

[Travis Scott]
At the green light I'm speedin', fourth wheel on, I'm weavin'
I got red eyes and swag seizures, all my concerts fillin' them bleachers
Ooh girl with this camo on, they can't see us
Tossed in a little more dank and a little more drank then La Flame might lean
To the point where they can't be topped, fuck around, make the Latinas pop
It's a new world order, never had my head on my shoulders
Uh, beware of the monsters: ain't that what your preacher told yah?
La Flame 500 degrees from the uptown to the magnolia

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
I'm a motherfuckin' monster (WHOO)
I'm a motherfuckin' monster (WHOO)
I'm riding up uptown, WHOO~!
I'm a motherfuckin' monster (WHOO)
One hand on the wheel..... uhh

[Travis Scott]
Damn you gorgeous, tell me somethin' I don't know
Dice on the corner with the lights low, got the base in my sock, fuck the 5-0
Damn you conscious, gon' get your head off the plate though
Lemme show you Yamamoto, take a little lick of the mayo
Out on 135th.. spendin' them pesos
Tell my nigga Fergie Ferg keep the back locked cause we got a little bit of tango
Real nigga from the south to the east they feel a nigga
Been a while since a nigga get a wait, take a little taste, leave you numb feelin' in the face
I'll pass if that pint ain't sealed, I'll make your weak inhale
XX know that we gon' die for this and probably keep it trill
Chain links, by nigga, popular, demand nigga
My bitch pearls from the clams, nigga, she can ride the dick no hands

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
While I'm ridin' uptown (WHOO, WHOO)
I'm a motherfuckin' monster (WHOO, WHOO)

[A$AP Ferg]
It's that young Fergestein (Little Frankenstein) pockets full of Benji Franklins; teacher, stay in line
Cannot take a break; in time, Iﾂ値l take ya shine, take your bitch, hit it from the back - Iﾂ値l break her spine
(I'm a lady) Your bitch look like Shanaynay
Margiela so cold feel like Tommy get to his payday
Going nuts like a PayDay, bitches thinkin Iﾂ知 crazy
My fraternity is the burna heat, Iﾂ知 a Kappa nigga with an AKA
Barkin' loud like Q-Dogs, movin' niggas like U-Hauls
Pussy niggas so RuPaul, you pussies get me tight like blue balls {*echoes*}

[Outro/Chorus: Travis Scott]
I'm ridin' up uptown...
I'm a motherfuckin' monster...
I'm ridin' up uptown...
Hand on my dick...</pre>
