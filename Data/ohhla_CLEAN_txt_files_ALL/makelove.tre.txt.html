[Trey Songz]
Excuse me woman, but it's something on my mind and I gotta get it off my chest
Baby girl I must confess, and I'm trying to say it with finesse
And it won't take nothing, just a little bit of time and a body up inside your dress
I promise it will be the best, and baby I ain't talkin sex

[Chorus]
Can we make love tonight
Get the champagne poppin off tonight
With your Secrets comin off tonight
Can we make love tonight
Bubble bath with only candlelight
And massage your body bet you'll like it

[Trey Songz]
Cause you gon' feel it from the minute that you walk in the room
I'll have the candles burnin
while the waters running and the music's playin there'll be no delaying
Outside its rainin but it's cool
Cause I'll just pull you closer
and hold you tighter and I'll say to you

[Bridge]
Let's take this night for loving, and make it last 'til morning
(We'll be) touching, (and we) kissing, freakin, so can we....

[Chorus] - 2X

[Bridge] - 2X

[Chorus] - 2X</pre>
