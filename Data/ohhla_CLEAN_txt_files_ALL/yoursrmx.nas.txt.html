..."It's yours!" --&gt; T La Rock

[Nas]
I sip the Dom P, watchin Gandhi til I'm charged
Writin in my book of rhymes, all the words pass the margin
To hold the mic I'm throbbin, mechanical movement
Understandable smooth shit that murderers move wit
The thief's theme, play me at night, they won't act right
The fiend of hip-hop has got me stuck like a crack pipe
The mind activation, react like I'm facin time like
'Pappy' Mason with pens I'm embracin
Wipe the sweat off my dome, spit the phlegm on the streets
Air the Nikes on my feet, keep my cypher, complete
Whether crusin in a Sikh's cab, or Montero Jeep
I can't call it, the beats make me fallin asleep
I keep fallin, but never fallin six feet deep
I'm out for presidents to represent me
I'm out for presidents to represent me
I'm out for dead fucking presidents to represent me

[Chorus - Pete Rock]
Whose world is this? (La la la)

[Pete Rock]
Whose world is this?

[Nas]
To my man Ill Will, God bless your life
To my peoples throughout Queens, God bless your life
My insight enlights vision
Words of wisdom
Niggaz pay me a tuition to listen
The murder paragraphs of mysticism
Man plant seeds that brings forth multiple breeds so many cultures on one 
planet but one culture's free.
Son, I need Weed to proceed
Change the flow speed and I'm getting vex Giuliani you 6-6-6.
There's no days for broke days selling smoke pays
I toke the chocolate potent philles never roach-sprayed.
Shit is a hassle, the bridge is like a haunted castle
The mic my religion and the system is the Devil's lasso
And yo, the trife life is the most influential
The colors on mink skins and pens is coincidental
How ya living large you broke,
You're wasting time extortin papers from smokers
Catching court papers getting broker

[Chorus - Pete Rock]
Whose world is this? (La la la)

"It's yours!"--&gt; T La Rock

[Pete Rock]
Whose world is this?

[Nas]
I'm the young city bandit, hold myself down singlehanded
For murder raps, I kick my thoughts alone, get remanded
Born alone, die alone, no crew to keep my crown or throne
I'm deep by sound alone, caved inside in a thousand miles from home
I need a new nigga, for this black cloud to follow
Cause while it's over me it's too dark to see tomorrow
Trying to maintain, I flip, fill the clip to the tip
Picturin my peeps, now the income make my heartbeat skip
And I'm amped up, they locked the champ up, even my brain's in handcuffs
Headed for Indiana stabbin bitches like the Phantom
The crew is lampin Ill Will style
Check the gold toothed smile, plus I profile wild
Stash through the flock wools, burnin dollars to light my stove
Walk the blocks wit a bop, checkin Danes plus the games
people play, I check the games plus the games people play
bust the problems of the world today

[Chorus - Pete Rock]
Whose world is this? (La la la)

[Nas]
The world is yours (La la la)
The world is yours (La la la)
The world is yours

[Pete Rock]
Whose world is this? (La la la)

[Nas]
The world is yours (La la la)
The world is yours (La la la)
The world is yours

[Pete Rock]
Whose world is this? (La la la)

[Nas]
The world is yours (La la la)
The world is yours (La la la)
The world is yours

[Pete Rock]
Whose world is this? (La la la)

[Nas]
The world is yours (La la la)
The world is yours (La la la)
The World is yours

[Pete Rock]
Whose world is this? (La la la)

The world is yours (La la la)
The world is yours (La la la)
The world is yours

[Pete Rock]
Whose world is this? (La la la)

[Nas]

The world is yours (La la la)
The world is yours

[Pete Rock]
Whose world is this? (La la la)
