[Intro: Ice-T]
Damn! the whole world is fucked up!
Everybody is a fucking liar, who the fuck can you trust?

[Chorus: Ice-T]
Lies, betrayal, lies
Truth or Death!
Lies, betrayal, lies

[Verse One: Ice-T]
Who the fuck can I trust?
The whole fucking world is built on deception
False perception, look you dead in the eye and lie
Your best friend'll stab you in the back
Yo, what the fuck is that?
Politicians lie; what the fuck is that?
Your lover lies; what the fuck is that?
The police lies; what the fuck is that?
The church fucking lies; what the fuck is that?

[Chorus: Ice-T]

[Verse Two: Ice-T]
Somebody tell me where is the truth
Every holy book is written by man
Probably by a liar's hand
And if you feel that public schools are teaching truth to the youth
Motherfucker, you living a lie too
Lawyers lie; what the fuck is that?
Doctors lie; what the fuck is that?
Your mother and father lie; what the fuck is that?
You lie to yourself; yo, what the fuck is that?
There is no truth; only variations of lies
Don't try to figure it out
Honesty is extinct, and if it ever did exist 
The human race took it out!

[Chorus: Ice-T with variation]
Truth or Death, Truth or Death
Lies, betrayal, lies
Truth or Death
Lies, betrayal, lies
Truth or Death
Lies, betrayal, lies
Truth or Death</pre>
