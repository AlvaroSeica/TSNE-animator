[Chorus]
Get money, don't be no lame
Bench warmers never ride foreign, so play the game
Never drop the ball, never accept a loss
Get back up if you fall, and when your number called
you better give your all
I hope you give your all
You gotta play until the end
The only difference between a winner and a loser is a winner plays until he wins

[Big K.R.I.T.]
Ain't nothing for free so get your ass up
My partner said if we don't speed then they might pass us
So we hit eighty-five, tryna keep this dream alive
All I see is green, I think these screens is fucking with my sight
Nowadays hoes claiming that they crushing
Bop a darling in my bucket till their heads catch concussions
But please don't push my buttons, I don't know you like that
Can't do no favors for these haters, I don't owe you like that
Well I guess it's the allure, like when you need to score
One second on the clock and the shot's all yours
Hit or miss, we take the risk
cause anything's better than Viennas and warm grits
Trading bust-it babies for fly divas that buck
Her only concern is if my car match her clutch
Yeah she a gold digger, but that pussy good, so what the fuck?
Don't be late for this player's ball, hurry up, and

[Chorus]

[Big K.R.I.T.]
They told me life is what you make it
So what you been creating on your free time?
I'll lend you bars if you need rhyme, or reason
Some people change, it's a part of life, like seasons
Just be aware that everybody ain't your friend
They'll be gone with the wind once your jump shot don't go in
or your ACL torn and you a couple yards short
from a Super Bowl Championship and it was down 4
Gotta play the field, be willing to ride, willing to dive
for what you desire, call your pop fly but never collide
with other players that play the game
Don't be eager to run with crowds, stay in your lane
Pass the knowledge onto your team, but carry the flame
cause it's yours and yours alone to brighten your way
Put God first and free your soul
cause even Olympic runners sometimes lose their gold, so

[Chorus]</pre>
