[Verse 1: Chrome]
On the real I don't understand fake ass niggas
Smilin' in a nigga face when they hoe cake niggas
All the time these niggas wishin they could be in my shoes
We ain't strangers we ain't friends and we sho ain't cool
Imma give a dog a bone and put his ass on
You don't fuck wit Corlione want you gone pretty soon
Lyin telling my bitch lies like you all jive 
Nigga you not a man you just full of surprises
Thinkin you got game cuz you wanna be the livest
Keep on talking so much and we gon see who be surviving
Never will I, talk about a man wit a man
Nigga ya so fake you will never understand  (Come on!)
 
[Chorus x: DJ Paul]
Trick if we was cool we woulda been cool
But you was sayin we wudnt cool
Bitch! Ya, ya bitch you!
Trick if we was cool we woulda been cool
But you was sayin we wudnt cool
Ya bitch! Ya, ya bitch you!
Trick if we was cool we woulda been cool
But you was sayin we wudnt cool
Bitch! Ya bitch you!
Trick if we was cool we woulda been cool
But you was sayin we wudnt cool
Bitch! Ya, ya bitch you!
 
[Verse 2]
And you say you wish me good but you wishin me hell
You WAITED for me to fall you WAITED for me to fail
See real niggas can tell by the way you niggas talk
Now you wanna be killas since you bought ya self a ????
Homie, we ain't cool cuz ya quick to throw a cross
Snitchin, tellin the feds I'm the one with the soft
You rather see Chrome down, fucked up, assed out
But you telling ya friends that we really hang out
Knowin we ain't straight cuz I know what you about
You really wanted me dead yep a gun in my mouth
Probly watchin my head go where yo pistol take me out
You niggas is bitch made won't you shut ya fuckin mouth (Come on!)
 
[Chorus x: DJ Paul]
Trick if we was cool we woulda been cool
But you was sayin we wudnt cool
Bitch! Ya, ya bitch you!
Trick if we was cool we woulda been cool
But you was sayin we wudnt cool
Ya bitch! Ya, ya bitch you!
Trick if we was cool we woulda been cool
But you was sayin we wudnt cool
Bitch! Ya bitch you!
Trick if we was cool we woulda been cool
But you was sayin we wudnt cool
Bitch! Ya, ya bitch you!</pre>
