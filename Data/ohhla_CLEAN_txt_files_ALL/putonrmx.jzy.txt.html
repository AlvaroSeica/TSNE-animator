I put on...
I put on...
I put on...
I put on for my city, on, on for my city
I put on for my city, on, on for my city
I put on for my city, on, on for my city
I put on for my city, on, on for my city

[Verse 1: Young Jeezy]
When they see me off in traffic, they say Jeezy on some other shit
Send them pussy niggas running straight back to the dealership
Me I'm in my spaceship, that's right I work for NASA
This 7H is not a fraud, call that my bitch my bodyguard
Call that bitch your bodyguard? Yeah that's my bodyguard
Wear a lot of jewelry, Young don't so security
What's whiter than a napkin harder than a dinner plate?
If you want it come and get it you know I stay super straight
Ran up in my spots and now I'm working out the Super8
Know you niggas hungry come and get a super plate
Y'all sing happy birthday yeah I got that super cake
100 karat bracelet I use it like some super bait

[Chorus 2x: Young Jeezy]
I put on for my city, on, on for my city
I put on for my city, on, on for my city
Put on - Eastside
Put on - Southside
Put on - Westside
Put on... (Yeah, let's go)

[Young Jeezy (Lil' Kim)]
(Oh yeah)
I put on... (You knew it was coming)
I put on... (Yo Jeezy what's poppin' my G?)
I put on... (I like this right here, that's what I do)
I put on for my city, on, on for my city (Yeah)
I put on for my city, on, on for my city 
(They want a show, I'll give 'em a show)
I put on for my city, on, on for my city 
(Yeah, eastside, southside, I'll do it like I'm doing it for TV baby)
I put on for my city, on, on for my city 
(I put on for every city I go to, proceed)

[Verse 2: Lil' Kim]
Lamborghini name on my luggage and my sports car
Jog five miles in my Louis Vuitton sports bra
Nigga I ain't playing, the celeb's in the courthouse
I show up and show out, that's my motto 'til the day I die
Trying to do what I already did, I'm on some other shit
You don't like me? Well I don't really give a spit 
They don't wanna give it to me, dammit I'ma take the shit
Get money international, y'all can have them local chips
I pops, can't duck the barrel, I was born and breed thorough
If you know me then ya know I put on for my borough
Might catch me in Maybach, Phantom, or the private jet
Put on like a billionaire and I ain't even got it yet 

[Chorus: Young Jeezy (Lil' Kim)]
I put on for my city, on, on for my city
(What y'all gon' do when I do get it, huh?)
I put on for my city, on, on for my city
(It's all over now)
Put on - Eastside
Put on - Southside
Put on - Westside
Put on... (Yeah, let's go)

I put on for my city, on, on for my city
I put on for my city, on, on for my city
Put on - Eastside
Put on - Southside
Put on - Westside
Put on... (Yeah, let's go)

I put on...
I put on...
I put on...
I put on for my city, I put on for my... 
I put on for my city, I put on for my city, on ... 

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I feel like there's still niggas that owe me checks
I feel like there's still bitches that owe me sex 
I feel like this but niggas don't know this stress
I lost the only girl in the world that know me best
I got the money and the fame and that don't mean shit
I got the Jesus on the chain man that don't mean shit
Cuz' when the Jesus pieces can't bring me peace
Yo I need this at least, uh, one of Russell's nieces on
I let my nightmares go I put on everybody that I knew from the go
I know hoes that was frontin' when they knew we was broke
They say damn Yeezy Yeezy you don't know us no more
You got that big fame homey and you just changed on me
You can ask Big Homey man the top so lonely
I ain't lyy-iing so lonely I aint lyyy-iing
Let me see what we have tonight what we have tonight
I'm high as a satellite (satellite) I see those flashing lights (flashing lights)
Cuz' every night, every night

[Chorus to fade]</pre>
