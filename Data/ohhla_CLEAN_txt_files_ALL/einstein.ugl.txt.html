Song:   Einstein's on Stage
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Verse One]
Steppin to the stage, right in front of your eyes
Young Einstein, he's about to go live
So, punch your ticket - then move up close
Pay, special attention - and take some notes
He's a two hand band when he's on the cut
And that's all we need, backin us up
He's got the rhythm - and the quickness - and the focus - and the skills
That's growin like grass with the mass appeal
He doesn't do it for the money - and not for the fame
He does it for the people cause he loves to entertain
So steppin to the stage, right in front of your eyes
Young Einstein is about to go live

[Chorus]
"Comin up on stage" - he's about to go live {*3X*}
"Comin up on stage" - Young Einstein is about to go live

[scratches]
I'm the greatest, go ask your mother
  Drop the beat, break it down like a droptop
On the two turntables
  Makin sure the beat come out clean
Ain't none of y'all cool like me
  Jack, I don't play
Transform
  You've never heard a DJ, with cuts like these

[Verse Two]
Get back~! When he puts the vinyl on the slipmat
Scratch so fast you hear the wrists crack
Cause my DJ cuts the record down to the bone marrow
Rockin from Carter, on the Rio De Janeiro
Einstein's got fans that'll stand in line
To see him speak with his hands like a pantomime
Yup, all packed in to a sold out show
Yelling "Go Einstein, go Einstein, go!"
He doesn't do it for the money - and not for the fame
He does it for the people cause he loves to entertain
So steppin to the stage, right in front of your eyes
Young Einstein is about to go live

[Chorus]

[scratches]

[new scratches after instrumental breakdown]
Wait a minute, I ain't finished yet
  I wish I could go on, but I have to end this
I, have, to go
