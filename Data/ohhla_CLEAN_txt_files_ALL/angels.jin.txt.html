Typed by: AZ Lyrics

You know I gotta say something
The beginning and the end
What's the difference between the two?
I mean I'm still tryna figure it out
I know one thing
I'm just getting started
You know all that stuff that happened in the past...
I ain't even thinking about that
It's about right now
And it's about moving forward

Check, check
Yo, dear God I wonder can You save me?
The more it makes sense the more they claim that I'm crazy
I had the beef for them to see me this calm
Or reality, uh uh no TV sitcom
My pure will got me stolen for Grace
Eyes closed, salty tears all I could taste
All on my knees, fall on my face
They say put God first and everything else will fall in the place
So I've heard, wise words got me thinking
Gotta give it time to let it sink in
I sound confused, I know
For what shall a prophet a man to gain the whole world then lose his soul
For the longest I was ridin' high cruise control
In my own mind making up the ruses I go
I swear it's not just my imagination
I heard a voice guide in me, navigation
Is it the route I chose or should I check the stair end
Took a couple wrong turns, selective hearing
Is it fact or just my premonition?
I see what's going on now, high definition
Nothing but lies I was living at
Wasted like Lay 6 it took me time to get my vision back
Learnt to recognize the fakes and the true snakes
So call friends, you know the twoface
All in my grill like a twofake
Still you never find me under pressure like the last drop of tooth pace
My mission has never been more clear
The Truth has never been more near
But I know I can't do it on my own
So I pray You give me strength when I lift the microphone
All I hear is "Jin, what happened to the old you? "
See I could explain but I would rather show you

Word, check it out y'all
'Cause actions speak louder than words
So it don't matter how I mix, the nouns with the verbs
New fans and glad God anointed my style
Old fans wanna know "What will I rap about now? "
Switch it up, yo I gots to do it
The word is "Jin's spittin' out Gospel music"
See I prefer the call it "change your life music"
All in hopes that one day you might use it
Whatever they choose they label it, so be it
I proceeded, all I know is I so need it
I'm certain that I can't rap forever
Before the curtain call I gotta get my act together
No surprise the room over my eyes has been lifted
My entire perspective has been shifted
I can't call it, you can call it how you feel
Call it change, call it grow, as long as you call it real
I am no quitter
My journey's just begun, you are all welcome to follow, no Twitter
I know plenty folks that wanna touch the gate to Heaven
Never been to Church 'cause they can't relate the reference
Ain't no sense in me, preaching to the quire
Even with starch arms I'd be reaching to the fire
I stand firm, the enemy don't face me
No need to wonder, only God can save me</pre>
