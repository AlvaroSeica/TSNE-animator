Standing.. standing.. standing..
Standing behind you are my specially trained ninja

[Intro: K-Blunt]
Yeah.. yeah, yeah, yeah, there they go, son
Kamikaze assassin.. they got hear it, yo son
Let 'em know, son, Dirty Bastard
Brooklyn Zu...

[K-Blunt]
I transform like water, the ninja, verbal manslaughter
That enters bloodstreams like poison, throughout the body
No remedy to save the, I caught you from Trenton to Kalamazoo (Haha Brooklyn!)
Don't stop, powers refined, liftin' two cents to ten times, wastin' no time
My wisdom, makes a large impact like 151 in the batch cookin' crack
In fact, where I come from I practice deadly
and rarely do they show their skills cuz they're scary
No way to, counter, flows that found you
You asked for this, so holy graduous
Shoulda shut ya mouth before you lost ya teeth (to late)
Now them shits is, fallin' out ya face
Can't wait 'til that sound sign on wax
Tell the truth, give a million folks the facts
Kamikaze attacks, out the darkness
First one with the fire so I spark this
K-Blunt, saluted, undisputed as an artist
Out the mouth rambler, who's the gambler?

[Chorus: Raw]
Ninjaz got that ill ass shit
Y'all niggaz ain't fuckin with this
This is ill as it gets
Ninjaz got that bangin' ass shit
Y'all niggaz ain't fuckin with this
This is ill as it gets

[Black Lantern]
Rome the streets in my dome, I'm ba-ba-bad to the bone
Hard likes tone, take advice, keep ya ass home
Ya prepare, ya search but the truth's already there
You stare cuz it's never been brought, under the care
Of the orderly direct, in fact, you're in correct
The outcome is death, sword across ya neck
I cause mad wreck and pain from my scorchin' flame
Many bodies I claim, militant, from out my name

[Drunken Dragon]
Now listen here, the majority of these MC's is superficial
Your lyrics so ass, ya raps'll rip tissue
Nobody's gonna miss you, printed ya last issue
Concide it, this is played out, that's why them raps hit you
(Yo, I'ma make this..) I don't give a fuck about, what a nigga got
If ya bust ya glock, if ya sellin' rocks
Boy ya still get dropped, stop before I hurt you
Lyrically I make tough MC's turn commercial

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Yo, I'ma make this hit, bump up yo' shit
Warfare flick, bitch can't tamper with it
Stop fuckin' with the black, kids, keep it on-on down
Tell the truth, kill ya lies, still respect yo' sound
Ain't no punk, it's just I'll always be around
Fuck y'all, nigga, that's how we gets down
I make you, shake you, urk you then I break you
I'm Ason and then I'm gone, then I take ya ass on
for the hip-hop ride, nigga please, step inside, and then ya die

[Popa Chief]
Popa Chief, hard-headed, black-hearted
It don't take much to get a nig like me started
Off the top rope, lovely, with this one
Put ya head up like a well-trained Pokemon
Verbal shogun, we all known the outcome
Another hit courtesy of Holy Woly Productions

[Raw]
Just acknowledge the ways and just how I
Gets prayin' like professor, son of a best
Take a lesson, angelic ad-libs
Mass transit grabs kids then our scripts flip like back-flips
Mathematic teachings combine with ninja tactics
Cut ya bars, pre-teens get injured with that racket
Zu comin' through makin' chumps out you bad kids
Colorize, terrorize, computerize, third eye, yo!

[Chorus]</pre>
