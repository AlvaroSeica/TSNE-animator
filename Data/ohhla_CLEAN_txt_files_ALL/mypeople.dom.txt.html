[Intro: Blue Raspberry]
My people, my people
My people, my people, oh, oh, oh
My people, my, my, my, my, my, my, people
They just don't know, they just don't know

[Blue Raspberry]
They just don't know, what I'm here to do
I've been putting in work for years, for years and years
And it's such a shame, when you start to win your pain
Thinking how many people come to you
I don't think that it is fair, but then you say
That patience is a virtue... I said that
If it was meant to be... things will happen
And you'll get your groovy back to fold
And now I'm shining, listen to me, my people
My people... they just didn't know
Listen, here come, the rapper to flow
People... my, my, my, people, oh
You was bound to see, you were bout to see
The wrath of Juliani, yo

[Interlude: Cranston Juliani]
Yo, human Raspberry, now you know that's scary
Yup, ok... we ain't new to this, man
We true to this thang, hip hop, been on the grind for a minute, yo

[Cranston Juliani]
I was hot back when Run-DMC was on top
But my moms ain't see no future in hip hop
So she made me stop and watch my grades
I was hot when at the barbershop, all niggas got was fades
With their initials engraved, and a tail in the back
I'm like Satan all I do is give you hell on the track
I take ya'll, to hell and back, and fuck selling a crack
I'm on the block, night and day, man, selling my rap
And they way retarded, I be sonning the bravehearted
I was hot, back when 'Zo Mouring played in Charlotte
Team mates with L.J., running trains like railways
Leaving my DNA on your female's face
Damn, now I'm a baby father, with a little lady holla
And I was hot when Air Jordan's cost 80 dollars
Back when navy Impala's, wouldn't cool the whip
Just cop the the beamer and some hammers and you was the shit
Back in the day when Junior Mo had the G on lock
And Jack Macky had to make it time to see what's hot
Ask your peeps about me, they done heard them stories
Bout the Bobby and Jimmy, yes I murdered them shorties
Little with no effort, your boy stay the freshest
And I was hot back when Rod broke Worthy's records
All I need is thirty seconds, and you a fan
Give me another thirty seconds and I'll make a grand
Have my street team shoot through, up in that van
Getting big cake, mixtapes is hand to hand
I short circuit your medula, man
Supreme being on the track, nigga, fuck who's the man
For all ya'll non believers, I'mma leave 'em a quote
No disrespect to L.L., but I believe I'm the G.O.A.T., yup
I believe I'm the G.O.A.T., what?
I believe I'm the G.O.A.T., nigga

[Chorus 2X: Blue Raspberry]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, my people, my people
They just don't know, oh, oh, oh, oh
My people, my, my, my, my, people
They just don't know, they just don't know</pre>
