[Dr. Dre]
Yo man, there's a lot of brothers out there 
flaking and perpetrating but scared to kick reality

[Ice Cube]
Yo Dre, you've been doing all this dope producing
You had a chance to show them what time it is

[Dr. Dre]
So what you want me to do?

[DJ Yella]
All you got to do now.. is Express yourself!..

[Dr. Dre]
I'm expressing with my full capabilities
And now I'm living in correctional facilities
Cause some don't agree with how I do this
I get straight and meditate like a Buddhist
I'm dropping flavor, my behavior is hereditary
But my technique, is very necessary
Blame it on Ice Cube; because he said it gets funky
When you got a subject and a predicate
Add it on a dope beat; and it'll make you think
Some suckers just tickle me, pink to my stomach
Cause they don't flow like this one
You know what? - I won't hesitate to dis one
Or two before I'm through, so don't try to sing this
Some drop science; while I'm dropping English
Even if Yella, makes it A Capella
I still express yo, I don't smoke weed or Sess
Cause it's known to give a brother brain damage
And brain damage on the mic don't manage 
Nothing, but making a sucker and you equal
Don't be another sequel

[Chorus: DJ Yella]
Express yourself!.. do it good..
Express yourself!.. go on and do it.. (Doctor)

[Ice Cube]
Ice Cube, it's not for the Pop Chart
So where should a brother like you start expressing yourself?
My boy will show you how, yo Dre!

[Dr. Dre] What up?

[Ice Cube]
Drop English, right about..

[Dr. Dre]
NOW!! getting back to the P.G.
That's program, and it's easy
Dre is back, new jacks are made hollow
Expressing ain't their subject because they like to follow
The words, the style, the trend; the records I spin
Again and again and again - yo, you're on the other end
Watch a brother blend dope rhymes, with no help
There's no fessing or guessing while I'm expressing myself
It's crazy to see people be
What society wants them to be, but not me
RUTHLESS!! Is the way to go, they know
Others say rhymes was failed to be original
Or they kill where the Hip-Hop starts
Forget about the ghetto, and rap for the pop charts
Cause some musicians cuss at home
But scared to use profanity when upon the microphone
Yeah, they want reality, but you will hear none
They'd rather exaggerate a little fiction
Some say NO! to drugs, and take a stand
But after the show, they go looking for the Dopeman (DOPEMAN!!)
Or they ban my group from the Radio
Hear N.W.A. and say Hell No!
But you know it ain't all about wealth
As long as you make a note to.. 

[Chorus: DJ Yella]
Express yourself!! Do it good
Express yourself!! Go on and do it (Doctor)

[MC Ren]
A lyricist, yo Dre is the name for it
To make some dope on the record, that's what he came for
Kicking reality overstaying itself 
But it's important that you keep it mind to.. (Express yourself!)

[Dr. Dre]
From the heart, cause if you wanna start to move up the chart
Then expression is a big part of it
You ain't efficient when you flow, you ain't swift
Moving like a tortoise, full of rigor Mortis
There's a little bit more to show
I got rhymes in my mind, embedded like an embryo
Or a lesson - all of them expression
And if you start fessing, I got a Smith and Wesson for ya
I might ignore your record because it has no bottom
I get loose in the Summer, Winter, Spring and Autumn
It's Dre on the mic, getting physical
Doing the job, N.W.A. is the lynch mob!
Yes I'm a cob, but you know you need this
And the knowledge is growing just like a fetus
Or a tumor, well here is the rumor
Dre is in the neighborhood and he's up to no good
When I start expressing myself, Yella slam it
Cause if I stay funky like this; I'm doing damage
Or I'ma be too hyped, and need a straight jacket
I got knowledge, and other suckers lack it
So, when you see Dre, a DJ on the mic
Ask what it's like, it's like we're getting hike tonight
Cause if I strike, it ain't for your good health
But I won't strike if you just.. 

[Chorus: DJ Yella]
Express yourself!! Do it good
Express yourself!! Go on and do it
Express yourself!!
Express yourself!!
Express yourself!!
Express yourself!!
Express yourself!!
Express yourself!! Go on and do it</pre>
