(Do you got Skillz?)

[Intro - Skillz - talking]
Aight, it's time to get in, ha
Now where should I begin?
To run back the ratchetness to 2010
Profound Sounds, y'all cut the track up
I'm a get it in, this the twenty ten Rap Up

[Verse 1 - Skillz]
Now Waka Flocka went hard and got shot in the paint
Kelis went a little harder, took Nas to the bank
All that bread on the monthly? Son that's crazy
Did I mention the fact she only had one baby?
Then the 'quake hit Haiti and left us in awe
So pray for them and pray you never see the things they saw
+We Are The World+ got made, just to donate bucks
No "I" in we though, I just think we fucked that up
Sade came back and blessed the world with her gift
John Mayer went there and let the N word slip
And Yung Berg got robbed by his peers
It's not '09 though, he just seems to do that every year
50 Cent tried to take out Ross
Look like it ain't work Fif, you might have to take that loss
Rozay, he had some heat
Had everybody from the 'burbs to the streets thinkin they was Big Meech
Ross had a good year, that's fact
But him baggin Stacey Dash? Mmm, I don't know 'bout that
Now I might sound thirsty
But Erykah Badu's video? Woo, Lord have mercy, mmm
And I don't mean to sound foul
But if I could hit that, I'd dress up like a clown right now (right now)
So don't tempt me, ha
And nobody had one, but we was rappin 'bout +Beamer, Benz and Bentleys+
Mel Gibson, spazzed out for real
Idiots of the year? BP, for the oil spill
And Wayne went to jail for his gat
They said he had a music player, where he hide that at?
No matter where you looked, it was hard to miss Drake
But easy to miss 50, when he lost that weight
LeBron made a Decision, that move was bold
But he had to take the heat, once the Heat got cold
Hey Cleveland, I'll holla
'Bron's the reason a hot dog in Cleveland'll cost ya eighty-four dollars
The iPhone prototype, that got jacked
Shout to rappers that was dumb enough to touch Kat Stacks, mmm
I know what ya thinkin kid
And no, I didn't touch her, but I know a lot of rappers that did
Kanye had Twitter goin nuts
Man y'all funny, since when you cared about the World Cup? (uh)
Facebook, talk of the town
And don't lie, you know you was cryin right along with Chris Brown
But in the New Year, what I don't wanna see
Is Montana Fishburne or a movie in 3D
And Swizz wifed Alicia Keys
The volcano cloud had me and Jazzy Jeff stuck overseas
And rappers, they weren't excitin
But I'd hate to see your parents if you came out lookin like 50 Tyson
And Antoine Dodson, that was just trife
With all that "hide ya kids and hide ya wife"
Man, the industry sucks
'Cause we started off laughin at both of them but now they laughin at us
Ha, I'm just askin
How Lady Gaga could wear some raw meat but y'all call that fashion?
And Fantasia, she went the suicide route
Oh, you gon' kill yourself, before your album come out?
Lil Wayne came home like jail was a fad
They sold us big iPhones and they called 'em iPad's
And we all got barraged
By the many faces and many voices of Nicki Minaj
Old girl got it in, ha
And before the year was over she was already beefin with Kim
Lindsay Lohan, behind bars
I guess I wasn't supposed to notice that a dancer won "Dancing With the Stars"
The census came tryin to get the count right (uh)
And Paris Hilton, well she got caught with the white
And Petey Pablo, need a reverend
Dog, a gun? In an airport? On 9/11?
Obama still tryin to do his thing
They caught T.I. with three pills and sent him back to the bing
Miley Cyrus, had us at a loss for words
A lot of y'all got addicted to Angry Birds
The miners got freed, live on TV
Y'all could of gave 'em somethin, maybe a Double Down from KFC
YouTube views, that could get ya some bread
Ask that little white boy with the real big head
Usher came back and still claimin King
He signed Justin Bieber though, can you say cha-ching?
Willow +Whipped Her Hair+ and hit the perfect score
Rather see hers, than anybody on Jersey Shore
Republicans, ha, they still trippin
A WikiLeak? Nah, where I'm from man, we call that snitchin
Raz-B and Chris Brown, they had some words
I got three for Raz-B Â– you got served!
I hear a lot of Rap Ups gettin made for real
Ehh, he's alright but he's not Skillz
With that being said, I send a R.I.P
To Guru, Gary Coleman and Miss Teena Marie
Apache, Eyedea and Lena Horne, the star
Huddy Combs, Hideo and Cool DJ Law
May they all rest in heaven
The Rap Up is wrapped up, I'll catch y'all in 2011</pre>
