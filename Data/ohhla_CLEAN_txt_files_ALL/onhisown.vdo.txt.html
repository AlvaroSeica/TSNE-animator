Song:   On His Own
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Man, my whole life I've been here
If I don't do this, if I don't do that

[Chorus]
Get it to the back
To the back
Keep it going cause now isn't funny
But his lifestyle is out on his own, here
Out on his own here
Out on his own here
Out on his own here
Get on the side!
On the side
In case your pop is fucked
You're keeping the rock soft
Cause he knows he's out on his own here!
Out on his own here!

Fitted to the back, I match blue Yankee
This dudes they do hate me
You thank me, cause I 'm you what you ain't me
I'm the best witty, so let's get it, [?]
Fill it!
I ain't got time to stress
Give me?
I heard you are spinning to impress witty
Drive by the apartment
And seen that rich on the balcony kissing on that girl like God bishop
No time to shoot
I'm still a flat nigga
I live in a public mansion
My mortgage is far biggest
Vado, your boy is out on his own here
For dues, crime square, we get it on here
Sure he wants a crime, but he can't stand here
[?] treat a black like ten shits

[Chorus]

This ain't man
I'm getting paper now
I could get you cleaned up quick, like paper town
Ha, I got that [?] to the gate where I live

Fuck her, [?]
I keep [?] my song with a few new starters
I'm getting money out of dollars
So we don't have to walk out in the club and call silence

[?] my bitch comes uninvited
My door man won't let her up
They rather see me down instead of above

[Chorus]

Yeah, I'm in the class all by myself
Sixty-five ex class all by myself
I come with cash all by myself
Two girls, one mess, all by myself
My [?] bag all by myself
And pass and see [?] all by myself
Myself
Don't make me take the [?] of myself
Cause I'm a gee like the Gucci style all by myself

[Chorus]</pre>
