Typed by: AZ Lyrics

We got the blood that oozes slow
The sickos and creeps, this carnival
We got the screams that shiver your spine
The hatchet that hacks the meat out the swine
We got the spiders, they're spawning and spawning
From the head to the shoulders they crawl on the dead
We got the axe still stuck in the head
We got two dead bodies fucking them {?}
We got that wicked what you needed more
At the Dark Carnival Creep Show

Scary, demented, and crazy, so check out our
Freaky Creep Show
Mad'ning and eerie and you'll wanna go to the
Freaky Creep Show
Scary, demented, and crazy, so check out our
Freaky Creep Show
Mad'ning and eerie and you'll wanna go to the (show)
Freaky Creep Show

We got that paint for the smile we wear
We caught a witch and cut off her hair
We got them gloves that choke the neck
We got them six, the Joker's Deck
We got them drums, demonic guitar
We got yo last breath in a jar
We got the killers who stalk you down
Tape out the scene and chalk around
We got that terror you been looking for
At the Dark Carnival Creep Show

Scary, demented, and crazy, so check out our
Freaky Creep Show
Mad'ning and eerie and you'll wanna go to the
Freaky Creep Show
Scary, demented, and crazy, so check out our
Freaky Creep Show
Mad'ning and eerie and you'll wanna go to the show
Creep, Creep, Creep, Creep

[More voodoo chants]

Bang! Pow! Boom!

Ladies and gentlemen, without further ado
The throat chokers, cut-throat jokers
Juggalotus and you know this
Most hated band on the planet
So fresh they can't stand it
Dark Carnival minions
The Duke of the Wicked
And the Southwest-side Stranglord himself
Big Violent J, and Sugar Shaggy2Dope
Wicked-wicky-wocked-wicky-wicked Clowns, bitch!

Scary, demented, and crazy, so check out our
Freaky Creep Show
Mad'ning and eerie and you'll wanna go to the
Freaky Creep Show
Scary, demented, and crazy, so check out our
