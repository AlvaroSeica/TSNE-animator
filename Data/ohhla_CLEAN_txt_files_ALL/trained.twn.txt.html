[Lone Ninja]
Sworn to defend, soar to the end of the universe
Aura extends from the moon to earth 
My body is a sacred vessel
I'm sorry but your fate is dreadful, you hardly		
Could evade the vengeful crawl and hide
There's horrid, morbid cries falling skies			
Animal part vicious, battle 
With harsh grimness, travel beyond limits		 	
Barrage wicked, strike with the weapon
Mirage vivid, strive for perfection		
March in with dark aura, start 
Horror, yall in some hot water	
Hail and obey the code of the sovereign
Assail with the blade, approach us with caution	
Soldiers and squadrons,are seen fleeing
Loner and Marxman, supreme beings		

[June Marx]
Savage roar, wrath of the captured moor
Transcendent, calculating math of war
I am the Avatar, born in the planet core
saboteur, hooded cloak assassins soar
Launch cannonball, crush a hundred men
Time for battle flying shrapnel puncture skin
Rugged twins, ushered in by the gusts of wind
Stomach rumbling..let the hunt begin!
Bring a humble end, any force attack us
Cause mammoths to backflip across atlas
Off the axis, trained transcendents
Pain and vengeance, no chains no pendants
Slain at the entrance, terrible pain
Train in trenches, unbearable terrain
Refrain, the reign measurement is endless
While they succumb to the pleasures of the senses
Transcend this, in the present stage
Secret pamphlets stashed in tibetan caves
Relentless rage, let my mind expand
Blueprint ancient zaragoza diagram
Trinity doctrine, stargate eye exam
Orb artifact pried from a dying hand
Take a higher stand, reallign charts
Transcend, rebuild, redesign the arts
