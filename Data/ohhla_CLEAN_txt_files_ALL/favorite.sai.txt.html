[Chorus: Saigon]
Me when I'm rhymin', remarkable timin'
Shorty's with brown eyes that sparkle like diamonds
Us in the park when we played on the swings
These are a few of my favorite things
Heckler koch's, necklaces and watches
Brethren that got no respect for the coppers
My cousin Face who was placed in the bing
These are a few of my favortite things
