Worked for the empire worked for the Hutts
Worked for anybody cause I didn't give a fuck
A job is a job and a bounty gets a buck
And I'm always kinda poor cause this war kinda sucks
The mental schizophrenic from the gas planet Gand
I'm a chubby little grub, more insect than a man
Three fingers on each hand I can regenerate limbs
I'm a rebel sympathizer cause a guy killed my kin
Don't talk, don't sleep and I don't take baths
Never could compete flunked fourth grade math
Crash course in the Force made of poor kids' laughter
Now I'm meditatin waitin predictin' the prey's path
When I said I, might have been a Jedi
Nobody gave a shit so I split on the red eye
So I go buy a blaster and a bowtie
To the hunters guild cause this field has a gold mine

[Chorus]
We got the bug eyes, it doesn't bug us
4lom and Zuckuss bad-ass motherfuckers
We got the bug eyes, it doesn't bug us
4lom and Zuckuss bad-ass motherfuckers

Then I got a partner and the jokes were never funny
For him it's not an art it's for the love of the money
We would ambush our opponents intercept their information
He brought the knowledge and logic I brought the meditation
Got a reputation, now my bling is a computer
Vader called us up to chill on the executor
Said he had a smuggler that was buggin his breather
Yo I can relate I can't hardly breathe either
It's a mess but not the best when we can finally find Fett
Intercept the bounty cut the gross, and not the net
He's a tricky little dick with a dent in his dome
Got away with solo now Lom's a puddle of chrome
Brain was wiped got him workin but it wasn't the same
Like back in the day off the chain kickin ass taking names
I became a rebel agent thanks to 21-B
A new lung new life, yo it's up in the streets

[Outro]
We got the bug eyes, we got the bug eyes
We got the bug eyes, new lung new life yo it's up in the streets
We got the bug eyes, we got the bug eyes
We got the bug eyes, we got the bug eyes
New lung new life, yo it's something to see
That's it~!</pre>
