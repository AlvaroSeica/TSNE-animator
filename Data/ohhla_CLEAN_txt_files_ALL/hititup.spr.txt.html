Uh-oh, yeah
Uh-oh, yeah

1 - Hey yo, all my life I've been trying to live it up
    Pigeons like to flock they just wanna give it up
    I don't want a girl
    I just wanna hit it up

Yo, I don't wish nobody one the best
What the  you expect?
Blessings when my own  be correct
Blaze trum, coming for you gazy dons with arms
Hit your crib, blaze your moms
I spit bombs, eating  real like Jeff Dons
And chiefs that disagree with me, wave your arms
Don't get is twism, quit rapping and stick to living
You like a  cycle dawg nobody like you
I'm in the cockpit with hot 
And just like money in Titanic
I'm teaching  how to hot spit
I lock  peddeling rocks
Better off down in Broadway peddling socks
My hands stay hot, that's why the put metal with 
I'm gonna rock till I'm on a yacht settling stocks
Man  when you done with g's, I'm hungry
Split a cat from his hat to his Dungarees

Repeat 1

Hey yo I can't spit gotta smoke a  to this
I'm a hit a  make her son to this
You can't turn yourself in you gotta run to this
&gt;From police  tote your gun to this
Yo my car's futuristic that's where I keep the biscuit
Any girl's seen my  before must have kissed it
Shouts to my district, girls claim distant
Don't ever kiss chicks that wear lipstick
By holler catch my  on a visit
With Timbs, when I get rich cop the lizards
Hit a club, out the car like where the 
Y'all  know first out being snitches
Catch me on tv or in your girl's pictures
Peep the background see if panties in the pictures
Stay with the lickest
Surrounded by 
We the jiggest rate girls on who the thickest

Repeat 1

Yo, I feel like we can fly when I floor the ride
With them doors that open towards the sky
 on the block like your brand Delgado
Cause I pump out exotic you can test my product
Life is full of stress so I drink Old Gold
Smoke a  bring my high back with the stove
Body frame young but my mind is old
Bad student but with  I can honor roll
And the only crime I risk my life for is federal
Cause doing time for big dough is more acceptable
Girl with sex candies that's edible
Only if she got a good job like in medical
Grand stay recording, stay wearing Jordans
Beeper with the phone so a nigga look important
Yo what up?
It's that  who hit the club up
And  sitting there playing the wall get cut up

Repeat 1

If a  quick  grab my  and hit it up

Repeat 1

If a  quick  grab my  and hit it up
Uh-oh, uh-oh</pre>
