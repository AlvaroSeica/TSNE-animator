[Sean Price]
I'm better than mine, Sean Price, remember this time
I'm all that, jaw tapped, pa, Gregory Hines
Strapped from the wall, I got a package of raw
In the ass crack of this whore in the passenger door
Y'all niggaz is whack and should be slapped with the four
Shit like that be attractin the law
Can't get knocked, better yet, can't get shot
Bust a shot at the 'Bad Boy', can't be stopped
Listen to my old shit, they be like "Damn they hot
What happened to them niggaz, man, they flopped," word
Drinkin' and smoking, vice verse, smoking and drinking
I'm hoping these Lincolns add up I ain't supposed to be stinkin
Y'all niggaz is farsighted, didn't notice the kingpin
Up close in your face, bust toast in your face

[Chorus: Sean Price]
Peep my words, words, heavenly word, words
Stackin' niggaz locked up in the 73rd
Peep my words, words, heavenly word, words
Stackin' niggaz locked up, locked up, locked up

[Sean Price]
Aiyyo, I'm bustin the cronz, call me Ruckus but Sean's
the name that I choose to be called when I'm in front of my moms
Get it? Get the fuck from in front of me pa
The number one stunner gunnin for y'all, listen
I got little guns that'll straight pounce ya melon
Got big guns 'bout the size of Mount St. Helen
Soon as I punch a nigga he like "Ouch, I'm tellin"
Gotta bounce down south with Welling, what up cuz
I'm Sean Price, watch me lead this shit
Boot Camp, no fatigue and kicks, nigga
Y'all niggaz is fake, straight perpetratin the fraud
Give me the cake 'fore I insert the 8 in your broad
Scared to death niggaz going face to face with the lord
Dumb out, bang ya motherfuckin face with this board
Fuck around and catch wreck in this spot, scared to go pop
Heckler &amp; Koch, reckon your not, fled from the cops

[Chorus]</pre>
