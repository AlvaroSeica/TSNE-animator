[Chorus][Kandi] 
you make me TALK nasty nasty to ya 
DREAM about how i wanna do ya 
THINK things to think about you bring it out 
you show me how to use my tongue 
you just some yum yum tasty tasy 
and when you take me and take me you bring the freak out in ME 

[Da Brat] 
i'm freaky freaky 
gimme head head 
i wanna see how you get down, go down, go down and get fed 
come 'n get some tasty tasy 
lick each 'n every individual part and make me, make me 
come come a chameleon 
see a different position to do something different to the yum yum 
jump jump on top of the kitchen cabinet 
so you can stick it 'n pump pump 
Miss Harris waiting for whatever i feel like having 
save you some embrassment 
i'm an Aries 'n i ain't scared of shit 
dare to flinch then 'n there i'll make your chest hairs lift 

[Chorus] 

[Jermaine Dupri] 
Only you do ah, ah 
think about this n try try 
to kiss all the places 
missed by the basic lovin' up your guy-ah 
ride in the park in the broad daylight 
real hard like we the only ones around 
back of the car, tearing u apart 
'n this how shit be goin' down 
when i pump you say harder harder 
love it when i bring my camcorder 
whipped cream, take everything 
even when we first got started started 
from the bedroom to the dancefloor 
to a slow tune up against the door 
to the up 'n down, to the in 'n out 
to the way you sound 

[Chorus] 

[Kandi] (Jermaine Dupri) 
are you gonna fuck me? 
(you think i'm not?) 
come on baby 
(i'm comin) 
lets fuck 
(i love it when you talk like that) 
yeh whatever, go down there 
(show me how to use my tongue) 
i want you to put your tongue right here 
(talk to me!) 
right there on there yeh 

[Da Brat] 
i'm a superfreak i do what you need 
i'm a slave for you, stay craving you 
i'm available, i'm unfadable 
and i'm capable to disable you 
i break you down, blow out your pipe 
turn out your lights and leave your wife 
lie me down on my back but don't let my Timberlands clap 
hit it up like its Wimbeldon 
don't spare a racquet 'cause Brat freaky like that 
just once taste of the nipple 
and two kisses will leave you crippled 
you done fell in love with shantizzle 
and i'ma keep you fiending for mizzo 
the 6-0 six-fo bizzo 
got one of the freakiest hizzo's 

[Chorus] x2 </pre>
