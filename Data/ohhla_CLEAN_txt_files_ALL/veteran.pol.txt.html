Colorful clothes?
(And the way the sunlight plays upon her hair)

This shit right here is history... in the making
Huh?
Check it

[ VERSE 1: Grand Daddy I.U. ]
I been in the game since Daddy Kane sayin No Half-Steppin'
When Large Pro rocked with the Main I was reppin
Before the game changed and the bullshit trappin
I was already a legend, veteran, ask your bredren
I scored me a classic, my first LP
Until you cowards do the same, fuck can you tell me?
I'm from the era of the boom bap, the real rap
Before the West or the Dirty South was even on the map
When niggas wore fatigues and they hat to the back
Now they dressin like hoes in colorful, tight clothes
This game's in the shambles now, anything goes
Come on, skateboard gear? The fuck outta here
When Nas said the shit was dead I read it loud and clear
That's why I ain't turned the radio on in 'bout a year
Cause Hot 97 be playin that garbage
And Power 105 be playin that garbage
Then these bullshit labels keep signin that garbage
Fuck that, I.U., I'ma give you the hardness
I'm a soldier, and soldiers do militant shit
I live and die by the code, and that's as real as it get
I ain't a Blood or a Crip, I'm a thug with a clip
And when I empty it out, niggas' blood gon' drip
You gon' give me respect in this bitch, by any means
Or get hung by the chain on your tight-ass jeans
Your days are numbered, your future ain't as bright as it seems
I'm 'bout to end your career right mo'fuckin here
Before we go further, let's get this clear
I Dot, I'm the Mack of the Year
Cocksucker

(The veteran) --&gt; Guru
(Runnin my plan, I'm the better man) --&gt; Guru

[ VERSE 2: Grand Daddy I.U. ]
I speak my mind cause a closed mouth don't get fed
And hustle hard, cause lazy niggas don't get bread
I'm from the 'Stead where these young boys bust for nothin
Hummer stuntin like they ain't scared of jail or somethin
I just laugh cause I'm past that
You came to beef, I came to ask where the ass at, the cash at
I'm the last of a dying breed, you buyin weed
I'm growin a whole farm to grow marijuana on
And I don't even smoke but my money kinda long
And my team blow pot, so fuck it, why not
Live from the streets of the 'Stead it's I Dot
You want what I got, yeah nigga, I'm hot
You say a old school rapper can't get no play
But the Rolling Stones can sell a million records today
Well shit, if that's the case I'm the rap Mick Jagger
Pretty chick bagger, check the stick swagger
I came in the game, I was ahead of my time
This era is mine, you listen to a veteran rhyme
I score points like Shaq in the post packin a toast
Far as dough, Steady Flow stackin the most
So be easy, you cowards don't want no discrepancy
Especially steppin to me without a weapon, G
You must be out your rabbit ass mind
MP stop the track, this here's the last line
I'm out
Fuckers</pre>
