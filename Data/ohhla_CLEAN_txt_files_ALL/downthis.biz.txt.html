[Intro: Yelawolf]
Yela...
Take a left...
Catfish...
Take a left motherfucker {*3X*}

[Chorus: Yelawolf]
You ain't ever been down this road befo'
You ain't ever seen a J runnin with no clothes
Grandmomma beat the switches with her hair in rolls
Sold a sack in the cul-de-sac down that road
Take a left motherfucker {*4X*}
You ain't ever been down this road befo'
You ain't ever seen a J runnin with no clothes
Grandmomma beat the switches with her hair in rolls
Sold a sack in the cul-de-sac down that road

[Yelawolf]
Catfish Billy, ain't it Bizarre though
Country motherfuckers, yup, I got a carload
Got a 30-pack of Bud in this Monte Carlo
And I'm mackin this slut who got an ass like a barn do'
Told her I'll give her the stick for a carton of Marlboro's
My boy said I'm trippin but she looked at it as charm though
What a mystic man I am with this art flow
Like creek water we harder than a drunk tryin to dart throw
Chevy's in the back, Barettas click-clack
Mullets and the Starter jacket, babies in the back
Gave my momma keys to a 1980 'llac
She let her boyfriend see it and we never got it back
Fuck it, it's a bucket, a bullet's in budget
I'll just go back to cookie cuttin and reach under the rug and
pull out a sack of bud and hit my buddy up for a nugget
Buddy it's all in the family, and I mean family by cousins
And we sittin in a fuckin beanbag
Front porch swingin, lean back
Big truck ridin, never clean that
Buckshot signs, you ain't ever seen that

[Chorus]

[Bizarre]
75 North, an hour from Toledo
Blue Chevy's, big body Regal's
Hammerton tuxedo, home of H-Piller
Raised by lions, tigers, gorillas
Red Magnum, helicopter doors
Them big potholes will fuck up your 24's
Detroit, Michigan where people don't care no more
Chrysler and Ford plants, they ain't there no more
20/20 vision, make the wrong decision
Get 5 to 10 in, Jackson Prison
Abandoned homes, drug dealers, crack addicts
A lot of white boys but ain't no B-Rabbit
When I gotta have it, blowin that kush
Car started out, I need that push
The home of the Purple Gang, the home of Coleman Young
Detroit, Michigan, great place not to come

[Chorus]</pre>
