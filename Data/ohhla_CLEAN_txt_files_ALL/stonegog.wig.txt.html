[Shawn Wigs]
Yo, we've been on the map, since Ghost two-toned the wallos
Staten Island, murder one, bullet heads with hollows
Wiganomics, you know I always with bottles
So fly, I slap big stones in my goggles
And my names engraved in the glass, T.C.B.
Cuz money come first in the stash
Blow hash and a chocolate dutch, you wanna brag about your magic stick
I got the magic touch, these ice cold bitches melt down when in my clutch
Grab the hammer, run through the streets with ill grammar
Work the, springs on your mattress, baby, I got stamina</pre>
