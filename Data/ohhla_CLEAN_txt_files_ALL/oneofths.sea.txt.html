"One of Those Days"
 
Jas Mace Intro
 
Maybe it's just the beat, that got me feeling the way that I feel...
 
Hook
 
It's just one of those days where nothing goes wrong
And everything is right life's moving along
It's just one of those nights when we're partying on
And we get it, get it in until the break of dawn
It's just one of those days when your vision and clear
And world makes sense living life with no fear
It's just one of those nights got your loved ones near
The kind to make a good week, a good month, a good year
 
Jas Mace Verse
 
You ever wake up thinking that today is your day
Like its your birthday even though its months away
There's something in the air, that makes you not care
That makes the clouds move around the sun like Fred Astaire
And its glare got the whole neighborhood shining
Clear like a diamond everything's on time
And the colors are vivid, the image last for more than a minute
But you ain't take no shrooms so you ain't tripping
It's a natural high, getting lifting by the fresh air
Inhale the good life when everything is right
It's like the last day of school now you're cool for the summer
With no bills to pay so you're good to play
Yeah it's one of those days
Where you ain't thinking about tomorrow you're just living in the moment
Hoping it never ends surrounded by your best friends
Until the nighttime when it all begins again
 
Hook
 
It's just one of those days where nothing goes wrong
And everything is right life's moving along
It's just one of those nights when we're partying on
And we get it, get it in until the break of dawn
It's just one of those days when your vision and clear
And world makes sense living life with no fear
It's just one of those nights got your loved ones near
The kind to make a good week, a good month, a good year
 
Marchitect Verse
 
Jas called around dusk, on the tusk or the horn
Talking about it time to chill and I've been hustling since the morn
So that sounds in order, there's a spot by the water
Where we're knocking back shots smoking out if we wanna
The bartender makes a drink, slides it to me
Ain't y'all the 49ers? He provides it for free
And just when I thought the night was going fine
Got a call from the office it's Vlad on the line
Everything is great but the fun's just begun
Check the charts 49 Seasons' End number one
Yeah it seems that we got another one
Until the night's done not a worry on my mind alright son
Not to mention my girlfriend flew in
She's waiting at my crib and she ain't fooling
All night had the good vibes flowing
Now we're out, I'll have to catch y'all in the morning
 
Bridge
 
Because I got the vibe, and you got the vibe
He got the vibe, and she got the vibe
I got the vibe, then you got the vibe
He got the vibe, and we got the vibe
 
Hook
 
It's just one of those days where nothing goes wrong
And everything is right life's moving along
It's just one of those nights when we're partying on
And we get it, get it in until the break of dawn
It's just one of those days when your vision and clear
And world makes sense living life with no fear
It's just one of those nights got your loved ones near
The kind to make a good week, a good month, a good year</pre>
