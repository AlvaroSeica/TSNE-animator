Here we go (repeated)

I suffer from the worst torment, burn my flesh
Screaming from the mercy, i fell from the rest
Humiliate, dissappoint, i'm stressed with the headache
My heart stopped beating, quick the paramedics
I heal from the wounds, realived or fatigued
Many still at ease from the struggle, pray for peace
Aggrivate a soul, who's at fault is it now
Embarassed from the frauds that are hostile and wild
Don't blow the fuse, so what, just for instance
Niggas wanna set it, fool, make no difference
Loonie of the looniest, the mighty Funkdoobiest
So fuck you and that fake crew that you be with

Chorus
We ain't hearin' it, havin' it, it ain't goin' down
(Fuck what you heard, it's about what ya hearin')
(4x)

They try to put shame in the name and kill a back stabber
The sucka ducked shit, of course it made me madder
Matters worse, the situations knotty
Nobody's dolly in society's party
Reveal all the evil that occured in the act
Bloody was the incident, shall burst in you back
The price of betrayal, the faces turn pale
Rumors have failed, truth have prevailed
Tales in the mist, but don't believe the nonsense
Everybody's getting over, nobody's honest
Break a promise to sabotage fortune
A portion of lies, who could be the spy
Sneaking in the film, mini reel, keep it solid
The loot on their mind with their eye on their wallet

Chours

99 bottles of beer on the wall
Anonther all gone cause T-Funk drunk 'em all
I call all you peasents in fear near the hour
Niggas self destruct, implode from the power
Tower
Many of corse have seen the 4 fronts
Smoking more blunts and fucking more stunts
Seems like an epidemic, the phony spreading
Giving altrocidies, didn't see the dead end
Whatcha gonna do with the picca boo 1, 2
Break a fool up in this bitch nothing knew
Cause you'll be the victim, treason is the reason
Don't wanna be locked down for the season
These are the schemes that prove themselves evident
Incomplete, non-sipher, irrevilent

Chorus

Here we go (fades with song)</pre>
