[Shawn Wigs]
This is Theodore, we move like an 18 wheeler
Trife gon', wax the joint, I'm just laying down the sealer
Fuck Tequila, we knocking out Grey Goose bottles and
Wanted from state to state, hitting all the lotto's
Big checks, we blowing out local arenas
Fly whips, we got an account with Ray Cotina
And Ghost paying them tabs, so I'm copping the big boy
George Jetson Benz, with a little Lex Elroy
Damn I need a truck, two blocks, I gotta duck through
So many haters out there be like "fuck you"
You bastard, try to pop in my hood
That's why I keep Johnny Mack crazy like Jimmy the Goods
Blowin' dust bones, dancing in the purple rain
With no umbrella, him and Dan Serves up in your cellar
Stuffin' Gerder bags, shining the gats until they glow
Didn't want 'em in the streets, and everybody's like...</pre>
