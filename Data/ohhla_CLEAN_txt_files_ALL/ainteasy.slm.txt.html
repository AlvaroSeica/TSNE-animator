Hook:(x2) 
It's like bounce, rock, skate 
Rock up, roll and get the papes 
Slice the cakes and spread love thru this Peach state 
Hit the first one like the sweepstakes 
And we gon all eat cheese steaks 
Believe me, it ain't easy, to get cheesy, what, what 

(Slimm) 
Stakes high, my hands dirty 
I'm a big lick drilla quick flip gorilla for scrilla 
Blue chipper with more shine than the big dipper 
Spit dinero game fuck the hero fame 
Went from wild to tame, just for change 
Still a lustful brain for thangs like cold chains 
Crush grapes and grain but the key is to maintain 
Some dare to be different some dare to be dumber 
Bleeps and blunders got you stuck in slumber 
I'll a wake that ass like thunder 
Thudding on the late night, on point like a steak knife 
Keep the game tight, from the Dirty, fuck a fair fight 
Cause of static my monetary status 
Situations get tragic when I got to have it 
Destructive like Turkish earthquakes 
I'm selfish got to have the pie and the whole cake 
Working non-stop no breaks for the house on the lake 
All for the love of the Peach state, yeah nigga, GA, GA, GA 

Hook:(x2) 
It's like bounce, rock, skate 
Rock up, roll and get the papes

Hit the first one like the sweepstakes 
And we gon all eat cheese steaks 
Believe me, it ain't easy, to get cheesy, what, what 

(Backbone) 
Stay working in the late, that's right, stay right 
On a money making mission to the break of daylight 
Swerve the ride, serve to survive 
Everyday that be the forte       
Lay in the cut, never take a shawt buck, believe that 
Where the weed at roll up, see yeen got cha money right 
Partna gotta hold up, Sho nuff see business is business 
I gotta bend a corner in a minute 
Smash the gas, stash the cash 
Keep it to the flo 
Gotta stay on they ass, can't give 'em no leeway 
Smoked out on the freeway 
Chevrolet wit the brains blowed Congal and Dro 
Yeen know, so hence fro the 
We gone ball y'all till the reign 
Fall and when they reign 
Fall we gone ball y'all 
A yes, yes y'all

(Slimm) 
Boy I'm spit shine nickel clean dead serious bout this pickle green 
Make moves then we shake the scene 
Rule one is to know your team 
To avoid infiltration of your cream 
Cause all sleepers get is a dream 
And that's on everything in between 
From the Remy X-O to the Monte Cristos 
Rapped around crypto but never too good to blow 
A fifty-dollar O of Jam Toe you know sucka boy play Rambo 
Get sliced off the hambone its Slimm and Slick Backbone 
We get the track blown 
For a dollar Calhoun Scholar in a Caprice or Impala 
Watch these hoes holler 
See it take bread to make bread, we only count in grands 
I'm trying to stack like the Sultan of Sudan 
For a 500 Sedan and a spot in the sands 
God Damn!
