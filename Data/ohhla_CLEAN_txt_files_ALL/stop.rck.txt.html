[Intro: Naisha]
Uh, uh, yeah, yeah, world wide, world wide
Feel this, smooth gangster shit, yeah, c'mon ya'll
Stop, hah, locks get too hot, know what I mean?
Them things come out boy, believe that
Uh, check it, uh, yeah

[Naisha]
I'm runnin with rebels, runnin with devils, cocking dirty glocks
This thirty shot make the city hot, them goons plop
Bufoons watch while I make it to my stash box
Thinkin I'm goin down, somebody call the damn cops
They circle the block, tryin to get a glimpse of the white rocks
Even attempt to make a sale, I hope you got bail
Rockwell static comin from my Nextell
I think it's a net tryin to warn me that them boys on me
It's goin down, everybody face down
Look around, heard the siren sound, click blao
See the frowns in the faces of death
Places if left, preserved in the ghetto, there is noone left
See it started with the best, nothin more than death
Every step was like a shortage of breath, no rest
Never kill time, deez is the rules
Next step, next scroll, let's unravel his tone
Next text

[Chorus: Naisha]
When you see them boys roll through your hood, stop
To my niggas that be up to no good on hot blocks
Bout to cut a major deal with a rep, stop
Cooperatin with the feds, buy yourself in a trap
Think you were the nicest lyricist on the map? Stop
Alot of MCs came across the kid and collapsed
One move, that's that, see your face, I smack
You didn't know I'd be getting live on the track, proceed

[Naisha]
Since a run away, beggin for a better day, put the gun away
Get done away by AK slugs, love my Persian rugs
A person's love shattered, it's bugged, sparatic, black magic
Back at it, using these words from my brain addict
I came accurate from flipping the script with ill tactics
From getting a grip on life from exercising bad habits
Keep fantasizing you'll be sleeping in that black casket
A million maggots eating your flesh like your stomach acid
Tha hood crafted, the flow mastered, no match with
No competitors, you flakey niggas hustlin backwords
Come check me nigga, I'm from Brooklyn, I spit sharp axes
For the classics, we first class, clean glasses
We packed with ratchets, back with actions
Stop your laughing, get cracked in fractions
Say my name faggot, The God you know, is guard you how?
Pray to God when you facing the pound, bring the chorus down

[Chorus]

[Naisha]
You didn't know that I'd be flipping them tracks?
You didn't know about the gangstas, prankstas, hoodies and bats?
You didn't know that I'd be aiming to steal
You didn't know that I'd be bustin, rushin, cleaning the gat
You don't think I'm gon get right back
You didn't know about the hot rhymes, tight rhymes, flipping the tracks
You didn't know about distributing crack
You didn't know about sealer, bag em up and serve em in packs

[Chorus X2]</pre>
