Message post: 6-10-90 never subject louis logic

You said it folks this guys clever
He got extra dope rhymes and punch lines forever
His stuff will catch in no time if his production guy was better
And theres nothing I like better then new battle lyrics
My favorite jam secret agent man you have to here it
I heard he got a fad review in a mag or two 
And now the majors want him that would suck if that was true
there aint a cat half as fat as lou and that is true its stayin in me
Or dudes with punchlines on major lables sprayin any
He even answers all his emails if he's got a chance at all
He told me icons real name is vinny
Maybe when he's getting chased by a bunch of sweaty face record snakes 
With chansaws and machete blades in pursuit like leather face and jason
He'll be the first kid who dont forget his place and sustains placement
Anyways hit me up on my email if you disagree or wanna spit a free
later dmx63

I said pray for the sunshine warmth today

But the cold rain cloud gon wash the sun away

You know this guy cries child but dont you weap

Cause mother son even goes to sleep

I said pray for the sunshine warmth today

But the cold rain cloud gon wash the sun away

You know this guy cries child but dont you weap

Cause mother son even goes to sleep

Well isnt this poetic faithfully
Theres another emcee  with major label fever next to me no
He'll make a disco record
Louis Logic the next thing to grow into a classic?
Its probably more likely Roy Jones will get his ass kicked
He has made some imprssive plastic but thats it
he never crafted a classic with an extended track list
who tries to make tremendous rap hits on 12 inches anyways?
he doesnt understand that this is hells business
all the labels care about is sales figures and your whereabouts on the charts
and rappers livin at there parents house
for tryin to invent the damage sound
which obviously isnt lous intent to save you the suspense
his newest attempts a dissapointment and a clear case
a great unlistened enjoyment for career stakes
so here's the answer and the ointment, show em no love
your favorite dick eating critic also known as O'Dub

So this is what you've all been asking for
I never let your small talk make me mad before
Cause after all when its said and done
Its as if these cats wish my only bread was crumbs
so let em front
Everyones a critic theese days, not to complain
Theese little djs dis wax of the popular phrase
But the topics the same, money sex and guns
Is that less expressive from how indie snobs expect it done
When underground records come with three choices
They cant spit
You cant understand it
Or its punks with weak voices
And you rejoice at three joints of the 20 tracks only some were fat
Then you wish you had your money back
Therell be none of that in my wax or stage show
I make extra sure to stay dope im spittin for your pesos
And kick them on the same flow to show you that im anti wack
Wether indie or major and their aint to many fans like that

**CHROUS 2**
I said pray for the sunshine warmth today
But the cold rain cloud gon wash the sun away
You know this guy cries child but dont you weap
Cause mother son even goes to sleep
Blue skies and the sunshine come today
To the rain clouds gone washed the sun away
I know that things arent the way that they supposed to be
so I keep my umbrella so close to me

Younge Fella you wouldnt know a dope emcee if the lord made them grow from trees
so some fellas wouldnt know a dope emcee if the lord made them grow from trees
They used to love my shit before the suburb chicks
Wanted to suck my dick
Now the rain done came
It's like they hate the flow, cause the radio increased the ratio
Its the same dumb thing

They might say my name, to the sound that creates migraines
Which means i dont go counterfit to change my game
I got a plan to be fresh, and even if the first families stressed
God damn the regret I cant be supressed</pre>
