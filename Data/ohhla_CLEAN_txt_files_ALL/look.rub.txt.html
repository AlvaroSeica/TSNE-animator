[Rubbabandz]
Look at the kid, look at the crib, loook at the way I live (look)
Look at your girl, look at my dick, all up in the ribs (look)
Look at her fiending for my semen, she open wide
I put it inside and she started swallowing kids
Look at the lies she telling, her man, she want a fam
She so faithful and the pussy is his, shit
Look at this fool believe this whore, when she just pack bags
And bounce for a thirty state tour
Look at this dude, I mean to be rude, but ya ho coming with me
Holding the tool, ready to fool, (look)
You in love with a bird, that's my word
As soon as I bring her back, I'mma kick her to the curb
Look how your boy get down, I dare you get up the nerve
Don't get ya self hurt, my street credibility
Is through the roof, I put in work and not do dirt
Don't get ya self murked over no skirt

[Chorus: Mali Boy]
None of the boys don't pimp like, to take a life
Fighting men, making hoes, stop like goddamit
Now look, look at the boy from N.Y., the black ride
Purple eyes, why ya hoes looking so suprised now
Look at the boy, look at his chain, look at his name
Look at the game, look at the TV's in the range
Now don't they look good?
Look at the boy, look how he came, look how he claim
Look at the game, ya'll lame muthafuckas need to stop and look

[Rubbabandz]
Look at the boy, look at the toys, look at the whips they pushing
Look at the cake, look at the weight, he supply the pushing
First the pushers to push it, niggas be like 'what you pushing'
And you don't really want to know
It's federal time, and ya'll ain't even live enough to know
Look at ya man taking the stand, telling the judge
I sling coke and I don't even touch grams
Now he in the witness protection program
Look at the kid back out on the streets again
Look at my head back holding my heat again
Look at the stash right back on my feet
Ready to clap dude who thought he was sweet
Look at ya man waving that white flag, screaming for peace
As soon as he touch ground, I splash 'em with the heat
Ya'll know my M.O., as soon as that iron come out
All you hear is a echo, echo

[Chorus]</pre>
