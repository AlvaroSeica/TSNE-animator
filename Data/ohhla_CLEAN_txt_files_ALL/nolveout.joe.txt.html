[Intro: Joe Budden]
Mic check, mic check, one-two, one-two
Made a lot of mishaps, lot of mistakes, lot of missteps
Grown shit though is when you can recognize that
And I recognize that, and real recognize that
Talk to 'em
Last word, check it

[Joe Budden]
Unbeatable force, insurmountable object
Bull should've known better than countin me out, I'm from the projects
So if I ever do it for greed indeed somethin is wrong
Prepare for the future, 'member I used to get heat from the oven on
They wanted to see Budden gone, fiend out on sour
But nobody helped put Budden on, had to bring my own power
So, I'm havin a private party, that only myself attends
And if the DJ plays the song to my soul it'll give itself a cleanse
They tellin me all the pain I ever felt was self-infringed
But I had help from friends, one even held the syringe
Architect of my own path, like to think it's designed the best
Defied the odds, I never aged while givin time a test
Known niggaz on house arrest, I'm on a minor rest
You tryin to call me or text me don't even bother, I'm tryin to give mine a rest
I got a treasure but its content is invisible
Was filled before with shit that I thought I treasured but made me miserable
My affairs together, here forever, yeah I'm back to work
Learned in order to lose love, probably gotta have it first

Uh, here we go (OH!)
Life's a crap shoot, my dice are loaded, ain't no stoppin me
Most interestin man, a hard place is between a rock and me
I'm torn within, and my eyes are heavy
I'm born again, just means I died already
Means I survived already, so FUCK they want with me?
World been against me so long misery hates my company
Isolated my whole life, not many know who Joseph is
In order to reciprocate love you gotta notice it
You gotta recognize it, gotta feel it first
Gotta be let inside it, feel its hurt and then kneel to its worst
If you contain it don't hide it, gotta reveal it first
And when you think you hit rock bottom gotta feel it worse
Or, my rule book is just dated
And for you to truly appreciate it you gotta at least be hated
Momma I made it, if anyone knows my way was hard
They prayed for my downfall on deaf ears, I was prayin to God
So God, I loved love 'til it resented me
And if it's still a stranger then I love who it pretends to be

[Outro: Joe Budden]
Uhh, no love lost, no love found
They found a little bit though, taha
I don't know where they found it out, but it was there
So I guess the moral of the story
is as you mature so will it
Just gotta find it, tah
