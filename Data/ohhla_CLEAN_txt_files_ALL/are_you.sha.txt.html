Hello, God...
"Are you there?" 'cause I'm just not too sure
Every time I step outside I see somebody breakin' a law
And I mean laws of nature
Lord, I don't know what I'm waitin' for
Just wanna be at my makers doors
'stead of endin' up on satans floor
We at this game, at this park
I knew names, after dark
Ref made calls, pushin' stars
Death threats thrown, "get my car!"
I said that loud, just right then
Shots rang out, peep my friends
We duck down, wait like ten
I ain't proud, my life won't end
Tryin' watch no game
I know bullets don't got no name
These little dudes don't got no aim
Brooklyn style, thinkin' why I came... .

Looked around, seen this crowd
Young little boy, dead on the ground
Moms is yelling: "Take me now!"
And I'm just sayin "How?"

Hello God... . are you there . . ?
Hello God... . are you there . . ?
Hello God... . are you there . . ?
Hello God... . are you there . . ?


Look...
I swear that I don't club too much
Might go to a lounge
I be down at the A(?)
They be playin' that southern stuff
Well, that's everywhere now
But if I go out, like I did last month
Saw a real nice crowd, long line in the front
But I walked right in
Some dude real put(?) like: "Who that is?"
"I don't know what you want, but I'm not that dude"
"Don't act rude": nigga on his side, I'm tryin to be cool
Talkin' to a chick, some chick he knew
His eyes on me, I'm thinkin he's a fool
Should I go home... ?

This chick was bad, but her kids had 3 different dads
Maybe he's one, lookin pisted and mad
She said: "Not his shifty ass"
And it turned out; homeboy thought
I was somebody else than his homeboy thought
But a hand on me got homeboy caught
With a left from security and homeboy lost
But he came back, claimed he was hard
Aiming at that big ass guard
Other people there, shame on you God
That girl got hit, 'caught one in the head
But I was thinkin':
"Damn, I hope she don't walk with a limp"
Even worse 'cause she can't walk
Is that her fault ?
Just cause come kid
Felt stupid and he got locked
Came home and he got shot
Suppose to be ya children
But you chillin', you do not watch

One of my friends got his top rocked
And his son had to see it
What's the sense of being human
If there's so much evil in human beings

Hello God... . are you there . . ?
Hello God... . are you there . . ?
Hello God... . are you there . . ?
Hello God... . are you there . . ?

Look...
How can I put my faith in you
When you don't show your face
We singin out amazin grace
But why come you can't make it safe
You know how many ladies hate themselves
Cause they got pain from rape ?
And boys that grow up likin' other boys
Cause someone changed their faith ?
And made them take
Or made them taste a man
And they just can't erase the hurt
So now they're shamed to face the mirror
And it's crazy, break it down
I know I sound like I would rather be a satans gay
But every day we pray and wait
I heard a song, you can't be late
I know I know you right on time
You gave us life, you gave me shine
And this is not no blasphemy
I'm actually just sayin'
I don't know if you exist or not
When babies die and kids get shot
And people drink and drive
And other people ride or die
And teens swallow cyanide
And some go through initiation
Just to get inside a gang
So then they blaze engaging faces
Yes, my president is black
And those who practice bein' racist
And the stories says that Jesus died to save us
...damn


(talkin/interview)
...why is it called the last supper
You know, this life is filled with tradgedy, horror
And the saddest most depressing stores of suffering, hardship and needless deaths
It is easy to understand why people question Gods existence
The devastation of millions, due to tsunamis, earthquakes and other natural disasters like the cyclones and so on
The millions killed in wars and revolutions, and by ruthless dictators
The terrible famines and droughts that have stolen multiple millions of lives
The millions killed yearly around the world though accidental deaths
The merciless ways of sickness and disease which has robbed millions of poverty lifes and in many cases caused slow and painful deaths
What about the increase of violent crime and madman who take pleasure in the suffering and killing of their fellow humans
Why does...is this allowed to take place?
And what of...when you look from a Christian perspective; what about the millions of martyrs..
That have been martyred, in the most cruel ways possible, killed in the most cruel and you know, merciless ways
And God 's allowed it...</pre>
