Who them stars pulling up (fa sho), ha-ha
Turning heads, still pimping, ha-ha, uh
Lucky Luciano, uh

[Hook]
You with your man, but still watching me
Now you, gonna make your man mess around and try to kill me
Cause I'm, gon do some things that's never been done
I'm, gonna leave you sprung
(you gon be sprung when I leave, cause I'm still pimping)

[Lucky]
Girl look me in my eyes, quit staring at my diamonds
Yeah I see you with your man, and you're just waiting for the time
When you can come on over here, and give me your number on the low
So I can put it in my phone, and then hit you up at fo'
In the morning, have you in the Hotel moaning
I'm ordering room service in the morning, then I'm out
Tell him to pick you up, know I'm timminy tal'n bout
I'm about making loochie, staying draped with Gucci
Never paying for no coochie, never swanging in a Hooptie
It's the candy slab rider, with a handy gat inside a
Glove box, you already be knowing that boy Lucky bust shots
Jackers running up, cause I'm the rapper coming up
Mad at the stack of money, I had up in the club
And how I took off with his girl, then I left her at the Telly
He had to go pick her up, now he really wanna kill me
He had to go and pick her up, so now he wanna kill me

[Hook]

[Uchie]
If you gonna look, say something
Just because, my shine stay on bling
Lucky, I think these bitches be tripping
So tell em more, so you bitches better listen

[Lucky]
Better listen up to little Luck, I'm tinted up in a trophy truck
Got purple stuff up in a cup, I'm glittered up with the princess cuts
Still sitting up on leather buck, getting big bucks off pimping sluts
I get it crunk and live it up, y'all boys ain't ready for Lil' Luck
I left your girl sprung, with my name in her mouth
She was taking off her blouse, when she came to my house
Wasn't no making out, I came to make her shop
It's that Lucky Luciano, I ain't saving y'all

[Uchie]
Hold up Lucky, man I said it before
And I, don't give a fuck about these bopping hoes
Cause uh, hit em up my celly cause they love to roam
Take em to the Telly, cause they man's at home

[Hook - 2x]
