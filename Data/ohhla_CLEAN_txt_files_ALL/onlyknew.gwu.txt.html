[Intro: Pop Da Brown Hornet] + (Down Low Recka)
I'mma tell all you playa haters, right, for real (uh-huh, yeah)
All you playa haters is runnin' round, tellin' on niggas (they got a union)
I see your man (we got a union for ya'll) talkin' this and that, right
You makin' 21 dollars an hour, doin' that lil' sucker shit
Or whatever the case might be, you might be able to sneak thru the back door
Cuz you did that lil' ol' punk shit, yeah, I've seen slim doin' that
And then slim doin' this, and slim doin' that
You didn't see me with your girl, though
And you gettin' paid to tell that, nigga?
(The name of this piece is called, I Got a Bitch, word the fuck up
When I got a bitch, I got a bitch, for real
When I got a bitch, I got a bitch, I'm not playin' no games
When you got a bitch, I got your bitch, when you ain't around
I got a bitch) *Yo, we gon' do another one, we gon' do another one for you*
(Yo, yo)

[Down Low Recka]
Your girl's fucked up, your world's fucked up
Situations a nigga go through
He don't show a sensitive side, so he keeps it inside
With so much stress buildin' up, that you are ready
To die for a love, a lot of things he tries to hide
Covers the tracks you got no solid proof, so you gotta let it slide
And I know it's tearing you apart inside
Everywhere you go you tell a nigga
Keep an open eye on your prize
But she can do up dirt on the low
Because if nobody seen it you don't really know the 411
But you heard she hittin' niggas off
Runnin' around the projects like a chicken with her head cut off
No respect for herself whatsoever
If you hit the spot you could get her hot, and run up in her
You thought she was your bread-winner
Fed up with aggravation, a black girl lost
Trapped in a world of temptation

[Chorus: Down Low Recka] + (Rubbabandz)
If ya nigga only knew
(That little trick put your lips at you too)

[June Luva]
I know this trick named Trina, Trina drives a Beamer
Everyday around my way, she comes through at a
Quarter to 2, if her man only knew like Keith Sweat
His so-called chick was straight twisted, wicked
Let me put you under what she did kid
I had her in the back-seat of the whip
Money was low and really couldn't fuck with the mo
One of them days I didn't have a place to go
She said so let's get it on
We don't need a whole lotta room to perform, ya hear me?
As I responded loud and clearly
I don't really support sex without the condom, ya feel me?
Very quickly she ripped out the Life Styles
And slobbed on the nob for a while
The thoughts that ran through my head
Was if her man only knew
How his baby mother is caniving and untrue

[Pop Da Brown Hornet]
Either ya do or ya don't, ya will or ya won't
I'm one to believe niggaz's girls be getting boned
Every day of the year
These chickens don't care
They're living in a world that's unfair

[Chorus: Down Low Recka]
If ya nigga only knew, that I was runnin'
Up in you (what would he do?)
If ya nigga only seen, how his wifey
Was stressin' me... he would leave, he would leave
You alone, you alone
He would find another chicken head to bone
And you better believe, you better believe
That you'll be gone, that you'll be gone
And I hope you're independent, I hope you're independent, baby...
Switch!

*beat switch*

[Rubbabandz]
Raiders of the Lost Art, I master style by a long mile
Showin' many battle I'm the winner
I curse your record sales thinner, to any contender
Tryin' to take my title I'm a heavy hitter
You tryin' to catch my blow it's suicidal
I'm any musicians idol
Vary from rock and roll to a orchestra recital
Colossal, hip-hop apostle
Inquirin' minds wanna know, if I ever fall off, it's impossible
I got too much potential, and plus you just startin'
I got too much pride to bait, so I demand you partin'

[June Luva]
Okay, okay, ya'll best to leave me alone
I'm in the zone, holdin' it down on my own
Come on, bring it own, I barracade crews
If you snooze like Kool G. Rap, nigga you loose
I bruise and inflict pain, who couldn't handle
So if you feelin' then pick at what's comin', take a gamble
I dare you, triple dare you, I'm not scared of you
Besides that your rhymes ain't shit, they're uncomparable
So stop, lookin, look ahead mista
Ain't no turnin back once the jewel comes to get you, you got
And the most beautifullest thing is when I drop my pants and let my nuts swing
Mothafuckaz, can you dig it? Best to back it?
Up ain't no tellin' what's comin' from out my jacket (BLOW!)
Duck son, this one here's a free-bee
So go spread the word, niggas can't see me
Niggas can't see me, niggas can't see me
Niggas can't see me, niggas can't see me
Niggas can't see me, niggas can't fuckin' see me

[Outro: Pop Da Brown Hornet]
When you wake up in the morning, you look in the mirror
And you say, look here, right
That nigga, came off, right?
Word is bond, look at this sucker shit here, right
What I did wrong, I had too many beers
Some ol' sucka shit, right, and you come back out right
And you do what you gotta do, man
All that sucka shit about corn...</pre>
