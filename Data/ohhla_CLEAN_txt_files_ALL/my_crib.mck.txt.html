Song:   My Crib
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

We can take it back to my crib
We can get away, no photographs
Chillin' all alone in my home, what you on?
My crib
If you wanna roll, let's roll
Why you tryna front then do what you want

Whoâs this I see?
Brown eyes, 5â3â
Legs right, ass tight
Just what I need to make my night right
I need some change
Money come and go like planes
Ohh fly down, what's your name?

Cause you're looking like the perfect love song
Girl, you got me going with your clothes on
We can do this right here but that be so wrong
So what you say? Girl won't you roll my way?

We can take it back to my crib
We can get away, no photographs
Chillin' all alone in my home, what you on?
My crib
If you wanna roll, let's roll
Why you tryin' front? Then do what you want

I feel no shame I want you donât play
All types sweet things jump from my lips to you wanna roll babe?
You meet downtown, send your girls home now
I'm home bound. What you say?
Cause what I'm really wanting is for you to stay

Cause you looking like the perfect love song
Girl, you got me going with your clothes on
We can do this right here but that be so wrong
So what you say? Girl, won't you roll my way?

We can take it back to my crib (Oh, oh, oh, ah)
We can get away, no photographs
Chillin' all alone in my home, what you on?
My crib (We can go to my crib, my crib, my crib)
If you wanna roll, let's roll
Why you tryin' front? Then do what you want</pre>
