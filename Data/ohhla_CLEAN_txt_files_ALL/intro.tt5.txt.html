[Intro: Baby Touch]
Warnin, the surgeon general of Brooklyn, New York
Has determined that the sounds you're about to hear
Can be devastating to your ear

[Intro: Bonz Malone]
I pledge allegiance and have to brag
About the united weights in America
And to this republic, for which we dance
Zulu Nation, in the yard, is the invincible
With ability, to Touch this, for y'all

[Tony Touch]
Say it loud, man, I'm proud to be Latino
Skinny like Vinnie Barbarino
Toca, esta loca, you know the steezo
Shine all over the world wit my sonido
Mijo, you ain't got nothin on this Taino
So benvenidos, by popular demand
It's the most requested DJ from the east coast
Io canto, en el nombre del padre, hijio, e del el spirito santo
I'm half Indian, but my name ain't Tanto
I rock my own slang when I bang my bongos
Now most people want it but have to main ready
So I'mma hold it down for them heads in Rock Steady
Renegade cut up the brake wit a machete
Beat breaker, suddenly, the street taker's a Piece Maker
Breakin it down to pieces, check my thesis
When my album releases, come on
Takin it back like Lee's wit the creases
Knockin this shit out that park into the bleaches
Grand slammin it, kid, I man handle it
It's mad scandalous, you can ask Canibus
The pit fighter, you sucker DJ's is dick riders
Mad as hell cuz Toca got his shit tighter
I spark a L wit a big lighter
Criminal use oblational to get inside ya (and do what?)
And fuck your whole head up
El Cavallo in the house, so gots to get up 
(say what, say what, say what)
I kick your whole chest in, can I hold it down alone, man, no question
