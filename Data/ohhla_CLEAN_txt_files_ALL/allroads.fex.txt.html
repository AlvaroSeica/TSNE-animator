The hazy days of life's parade
Were keeping me from seeing all that I'd done
No way to leave
Nowhere to breathe

The frantic pace all but erased
The memories of just how far I had come
No other way
No more to say

[Chorus] 
There's not a bridge to burn
There's nothing left to learn
Don't matter where you turn
Cause all roads lead to you
To you...

So I ran away, tried to escape
The winding roads that carried me to my fate
No way to live
No more to give

Had lost my way and stopped to pray
Watch over me cause I am losing my faith
And it's a bore
Searching for
Need something more
Just be assured

[Chorus]

[Outro]
La la, la la, la-la {16X}</pre>
