(Beep)...Hey, baby, it's me, I was just thinking about you.
It's time these niggas stop sleeping on you. They can't
even touch you. You just gotta show 'em. Don't worry I got
your back. I love you. Call me when you get back from the studio,
NI-GGAAA(Beep)

Your skills suspect, time to get your jaw adjusted,
Those kind of rhymes even got Young M.C. disgusted,
You think you the shit? Well I flush kids,
Punch you in the bicuspids leave your eye busted,
You can't be trusted like your mom with a bag of rocks,
I'm the greatest, you weightless like astronauts,
Hit you with more combinations than Master Locks,
You wouldn't have a shot if you carried plastic glocks,
I don't stop, keeping it rough like hockey leagues,
In drug tests my polls register dope like poppy seeds
Unforgettable like Nat Cole,
You couldn't hang if you were Stars and Stripes and I was a flagpole,
Asshole, I dictate fate like Castro,
I got grenades, you just get played like Hasbro,
Jugga smash fools, fast hoes get pimp slapped,
In fact, the Bully be on top like pimp hats,
Your weak I get up in your freak like Fem-Stat,
My technique leave you broke like cheap jim hats,
I been fat like Dom DeLoise,
Got hip-hop locked like platinum MC's with felonies,
Your jealousy is obvious,
I carry firearms like a burning octopus,
So nasty, I'm monogamous...cock diesel,
You get smoked like joints, I'm on point like shot needles,
So sick you think I got measles,
My Jugganaut scripts make you "SHHH!" like Doc Evil,
The Bully drop people you sweet like brownies,
You hard, but you won't bring that noise to Fulton County,
My flow collect a bounty like Boba Fett,
Until those fat girls screaming, "It ain't over yet!",
You overstaked your boundaries,
I think we at the circus, I see so damn many clown MC's,
Floundering like fish out of water,
That image you use doesn't work, your style's out of order,
I'm about to slaughter you like that sergeant,
You couldn't catch me if you were Steve Largent.</pre>
