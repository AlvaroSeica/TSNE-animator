Song:   I'm Dedicated
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I'm dedicated to the one I love
Deja te cuento
Desde hace mucho tiempo que yo estado en el intento
De poder sacar de mi una simple melodia
Que pueda repetir todos los hechos de mi vida
Cuando yo te conoci no te tome mucha importancia
Pense podria ser otro mas bien y se acaba
Pero eso no paso la vida iba lenta
Ahora que eres mio ya me siento yo completa
Mis padres no querian ni que yo me fijara
Mas ellos no entendian todas las rosas que me dabas
Eran para mi mucho mas que un detalle
Pues todo estaba escrito, esperandome en la calle
Me llevabas a la escuela y al final tu me sacabas
Juntos en el carro, mil besos que me dabas
Yo sabia que tu amor era un amor sincero
Y queria que tu fueras en mi vida el primero

[Chorus]
Now I'm dedicated to all the moments with you
You got me anxious for your love when your heart comes shining through
Boy, I'm dedicated to the special moments with you
I just wanna let you know that I'm dedicated to you

Hold me down and make me feel like I'm the special one alli en tu vida
That every night it's just me who you want to be by
La vida es dura sin tu amor yo quiero confesarte
Que tu eres todo para mi, tu eres importante
Oler ese perfume cause you know baby I want you
Esa es la neta te lo digo desde adentro it's all about you
I don't care about them other fools trying to mac
Make up excuses to try to get back but it ain't like that
Cause, baby, you know what I wanted
A crazy fool who love me for me and I love it
Te quiero, te amo, and I love it when you tell me what I mean to you
And that you would never play me
Y eso es lo que quize y eso es lo que tengo
Una gran persona que me ama y es mi cielo
I love you, baby, and I know you'd do the same
I'm so anxious to live life with you, it's insane

[Chorus]
Now I'm dedicated to all the moments with you
You got me anxious for your love when your heart comes shining through
Boy, I'm dedicated to the special moments with you
I just wanna let you know that I'm dedicated to you

Break-up to make-up, but we don't need that
You hold it down for me and our familia
Our baby girl, she loves you more than anything
And baby 2 on the way, here's your everything
I love to hear when you pull in from work and
I love it when you tell 'em that you're tooken
Our love is real and I know it was meant to be
To sleep with you every night, boy, it's heavenly
We have our ups and our downs but it's worth it
You got the key to my heart cause you've earned it
I wouldn't change you for any other person
Cause they don't have what you have, that's for certain
You've given me amor y respeto
One of the reasons por eso es que te quiero
Just thought I'd let you know what you really mean to me
I'm dedicated to you, you're dedicated to me

[Chorus]
Now I'm dedicated to all the moments with you
You got me anxious for your love when your heart comes shining through
Boy, I'm dedicated to the special moments with you
I just wanna let you know that I'm dedicated to you
Now I'm dedicated to all the moments with you
You got me anxious for your love when your heart comes shining through
Boy, I'm dedicated to the special moments with you
I just wanna let you know that I'm dedicated to you...</pre>
