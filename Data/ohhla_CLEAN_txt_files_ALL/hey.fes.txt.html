[Intro: Fes Taylor]
Two 4 War Entertainment, presents, Fes Taylor
Taylor Made, heart of the city
We back at it again!

[Fes Taylor]
I see ya girl lookin' like you on the red carpet
Peep the Uptown, I was tryin' to find parkin'
A Brooklyn butt, BX strut
Enough meat on her, probably drive a T-Rex nuts
Queens attitude, Staten Island swagger
Black, half Italian, long hair, had to bag her
Two 4 t-shirt, X-type dagger
Ya girlfriend know I got the best pipe, ask her
Sex 'til it feel like you goin' through asthma
Put ya back into it, you screamin' out "Faster"
Playa play on, on top, tryin' to stay on
Got a lock from South Beach to Bay on
Anything I say on a track, say it's a hit
Bracelets, now my jewelry game makin' 'em sick
Hey world, it's ya favorite Don (what up Don?)
It's Fes Taylor, a couple chicks on the table in thongs
(Alright then...)

[Chorus: Benny K]
You're the best lookin' girl
That I've done seen tonight (Seen tonight, baby)
You're, just the type of girl
That I'd like to wife (I'd like to wife)
Ohhhh, let's bring ya to the floor
Just show me what you got, baby
Just show me what you got, baby (Just show me what you got)
Hey, I like it up on me
Just show me what you got, baby (Just show me what you got)
Ohhh, noooo...

[Fes Taylor]
I'm hypnotized by thighs and her hip size
Taylor 2 Fly, bend 'em over, grip thighs
Custom whip I drive, bigger than my kicks size
Shoes twenty-five, so high I could kiss the sky
Mama, listen, I got a baby mama
She don't like men though, yeah I got crazy drama
Anyway, back to you, Miss NewBooty
Listen cutie, don't act like a groupie
I played the block, rap, I don't act up in movies
But I had a few bad chicks, sat in jacuzzis
Chantelle, Samantha, Sally and Suzy
After a few drinks, come out of the two-piece
Who flyer than them boys from S.I.?
We at the dealership, five toys to test drive
Drive off the lot with the tip placed
You know me, state-to-state, out the trunk with mixtapes
I holla...

[Chorus]

[Benny K]
(Fes: Benny) Tell me what you like...
And it's your's at the drop of a dime, baby
Cuz baby it's ya world tonight
Just come take my hand
It won't trouble me
What ya got? Ohhh...
Ohhhh, let's bring ya to the floor
Just show me what you got, baby
Just show me what you got, baby (Just show me what you got)
Hey, I like it up on me (I like it up on me)
Just show me what you got, baby (Just show me what you got)

[Outro: Fes Taylor]
Oh yeah, we got guns
Nah, nah, we got the guns and shit for sho'
Whatever, you rollin' with us
The Two 4 War, we all together
Yeah got homegirl too and them chicks over there
We all gone bounce, ya nah mean?
I got, my boy Lot-a-Nerv, yeah, he right there, he comin'
B. Real, he comin'
And we all gon' meet up at the telly and shit
Aight, that's what it is
Yeah, what up, I see you baby...
Yeah, Staten Island
We bringin' it real good right now
We got our swag' right</pre>
