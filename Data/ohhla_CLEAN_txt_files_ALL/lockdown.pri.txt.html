Typed by: Platinumknicca@aol.com

Hounds from Gert-Town, 
B-Way set, keep it up 

[Chorus] 
But I'm on lock down but I'll be home in a minute, 
Soon as I finish, in these cells there ain't no endin' 
But I'm on lockdown but I'll be home in a minute, 
Bet every penny, in these cells there ain't no winnin' 
But I'm on lock down but I'll be home in a minute, 
Soon as I finish, in these cells there ain't no endin', 
But I'm on lock down but I'll be home in a minute, 
Bet every penny, in these cells there ain't no willin', 

[Verse One] 
But I'm in the system now for feeda, My manager done put them G's up, 
Put the ki's up, thankin' Jesus, 
But if they don't, then I'll be stuck up in this bitch, 
They got me sick for thirty-fifth, lookin' at a year and six, 
Aw shit my head smokin', wasn't down for jossin', 
Court date approachin', I'm through until further notice, 
Can't get no bond and shit, Pumpin' iron and shit, 
Wastin' time and shit, 
My family cryin' and shit, Oh well, I'm stuck like Chuck, 
Can't come up on a buck, 
Got bad luck, fuck, I guess a nigga like me is stuck, 
But I'm gone bounce ya heard me, believe what I said, 
Ain't got a DA strong enough to keep a nigga like me in bed, 
And all my dogs Upstate got life for rape, 
Straight out the pen with the flavor in your face, aight?  aight? 
{Weak mother fuckers rappers on the mic, 
Don't know what they fuck they doin'} 
[Chorus] 

[Verse Two] 
Do you know who the fuck I be? a {P.T.} 
Then you know never to fuck with me, (from G.T.) 
You round there reppin' and stuntin' you better do what'cha gotta do, 
Beefin' with the seventeenth, shoot who you gotta shoot, 
Cause I be home in a year or two head bustin', 
Split him wide open made him die from the head bustin', 
See I'm known Uptown for bein' real, check my steelo, 
Hit hoes on the D-Low, ain't no hero, P.T. below zero, 
Enemies I make 'em bleed, chop 'em down like trees, 
Like Japanese with 2-23's, now clown please, 
I'm full blooded, better get'cha mind out the gutter, 
More slicker than butter, but nigga no shame in my color, 
Now who this clown think he is? 
Gonna run this til', I paint a picture for him, cut him up, and 
Then I show the bitch my skills, 
{Show the bitch my skills, my skills, pussy ass} 

[Chorus]</pre>
