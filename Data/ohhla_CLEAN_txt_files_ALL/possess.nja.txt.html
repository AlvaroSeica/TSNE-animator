[Verse 1]
Avenging souls, channeled, manifested
The den is cold, shallow, and decrepit
Zone out in a trance like state
No doubt, vicious and irate    
Discover uncharted levels, I boast
I hover on top of temple, I float    
Levitate with deep concentration
Sever, break, and seek domination    

[Verse 2]
Both palms release energy ball
Pose harm, see each enemy fall	
My heighten senses are in tune
I strike your trenches and bring doom			
Sing gloom, despair, and agony
The king whom prepares the battle seige 	
Cruel, stalk, kill, I'm bound to finish you 
Blue force field surround my physical		
Pulsing flames radiate from the body
Stalk terrain, raid, you're slain with your army
Duel with foes in pit or cage,
Lose control in fit of rage
In need of an excorcism The demons 
Possess its victims and scheme to infect 
My wisdom, I shoot the prey, the brute is slaying
Have ruthless ways, a Super Saiyan</pre>
