You know you're my cookie baby and you're too smart
I can see it in the lines of your school art
True heart
I mean courage
Expressed with care
Go on draw them superheroes with the curly hair
You're my daughter
My love
More than kin to me
This for you and the woman that you finna be
Tell that boy he's wrong
Girls are strong
Next time at show and tell play him our song
Tell your teacher I said princesses are evil
How they got all they money was they killed people
If somebody hits you
Hit 'em back
Then negotiate a peace contract
Life if a challenge and you gotta team up
If you play house pretend that the man clean up
You too busy with the other things you gotta do
If you start something, now
Remember, follow through
Later on you gon' blossom like a lotus
You'll get into boys and the boys gon' notice
It don't matter who you do it with
Just remember when I tell you baby you the shit
Handshakes are promises
Lies can spoil it
Words should be bond and seal
Wash you hands after using the toilet
Brush after every meal
And also

*Chorus*
Wear clean draws
Everyday
'cuz things may fall
The wrong way
You'll be lying there
Waiting' for the ambulance
And your underwear
Got holes and shit

Wear clean draws
Everyday
'cuz things may fall
The wrong way
You'll be lying there
Waiting' for the ambulance
And your underwear
Got holes and shit

Pam can I get a little scratch right here?
(yeeah)
Pam can I get a little scratch right here?
(oh yeah)
Pam can I get a little scratch right here?
(yeeah)
Pam can I get a little scratch right there?
(oh yeah)

My boogie baby now
The world ain't no fairy tale
And it's ran by some rich white scary males
To make it simple for you let's call 'em the bosses
They take money while the people take losses
Stole Black folds from Africa
To work for free
And we still barely get paid enough to eat
That's what I told you
I be saying in my vocals
That's why the woman got the gun on the logo
The star is the future
That we gon' create
Where nobody steal money from the things we make
The revolution takes time and space
But you as a woman gotta know you're place
That's in the front baby
I'm being blunt baby
If the get mad say it's they time of the month baby
Your face is just like the sun when it raises
Thank you for adding beauty to my phrases
Handshakes are promises
Lies can spoil it
Words should be bond and seal
Wash your hands after using the toilet
Brush after every meal
And also

*Chorus*
Wear clean draws
Everyday
'cuz things may fall
The wrong way
You'll be lying there
Waiting' for the ambulance
And your underwear
Got holes and shit

Wear clean draws
Everyday
'cuz things may fall
The wrong way
You'll be lying there
Waiting' for the ambulance
And your underwear
Got holes and shit

Pam can I get a little scratch right here?
(yeeah)
Pam can I get a little scratch right here?
(oh yeah)
Pam can I get a little scratch right here?
(yeeah)
Pam can I get a little scratch right there?
(oh yeah)
