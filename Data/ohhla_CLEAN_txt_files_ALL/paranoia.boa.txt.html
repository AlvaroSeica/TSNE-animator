Song:   Paranoia is Awareness
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

You could fool them... but you, but you can't fool me...
You could fool some people sometimes, I got it, I got it all figured out

[Verse One]
You have never heard the likes of me, pretending to be nice to me
So you can get all up and close and personal with my psyche
A blueprint couldn't even help you find your way around
The schematic of my brain you couldn't figure out the sound now
Take a look around you, everything astounds you
The search and rescue teams of dogs and psychics couldn't find you
Very hopeless, out of focus, I was open when I wrote this
Cameras on post and propoganda stuck on posters
{BLAOW!} Another freedom fighter hit the ground
And many more to come if we don't turn this shit around now
{BLAOW!} Another freedom fighter hit the dirt
That's why I'm undercover super secret and covert now
Blood of Abraham, I'm just two ordinary people with
extrordinary minds who pay attention to the signs
Watch your back, be careful don't be careless
In this day and age your paranoia is awareness

[Chorus]
Paranoia is awareness, why we scared of this, why we gettin careless
(L.A. down to New York, Australia to Uganda) .. don't need propoganda
Paranoia is awareness, why we scared of this, why we gettin careless
(New York down to L.A., Australia to Uganda) .. don't need propoganda

[Verse Two]
Adjust your minds think optimistic, kids I'm drinkin double fisted
I'm the simplistic, friendly neighborhood mystic
Technology has put a strain upon humanity
The Western mentality with the Eastern philosophies
All mixed up in one, threw me in the right-hand sun
Baskin in the rays and radio waves, ether that's rotund
Damn it's somethin when your stomach starts to grumble
Just when you thought shit was in control I'll make you fumble now
{BLAOW!} Another freedom fighter bites the dust
Votin for the less of evils cause we never trust now
{BLAOW!} Another freedom fighter disappears
Never to be seen again they feedin on your fears now
The Blood of Abraham are just two ordinary people with
extrordinary minds who pay attention to the signs
Watch your back, be careful don't be careless
In this day and age your paranoia is awareness

[Chorus]

[Interlude]
You could fool some people sometimes
But you can't fool all the people all the time
You could fool some people sometimes
(I got it all figured out... y'know?)

[Verse Three]
It's amazing when you stop and think about the times we're livin in
The government should hand out free shampoo with their conditionin
They're callin all the master plans to hook their lines and sinkers
They captured all the fools and now they're lookin for the thinkers
But you shouldn't have to worry, cause you're not one of those
Individuals who show the negative exposed like, light
You slipped on rock you went and now saw the roaches scatter
Put that same rock back you wouldn'ta saw the roaches splatter

[Verse Four]
It's amazing when you stop and think about the times we're livin in
The government should hand out free shampoo with their conditionin
They're callin all the master plans to hook their lines and sinkers
They captured all the fools and now they're lookin for the thinkers

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Paranoia is awareness, why we scared of this, why we gettin careless
(Israel to Asia, Europe to Atlanta) .. don't need propoganda

(Bahamas on to China, yeah, yeah) .. don't need propoganda

"Paranoia strikes deep"</pre>
