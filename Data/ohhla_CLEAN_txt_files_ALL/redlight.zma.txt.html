(1-2-3) 
Green light

Tic-tac-toe, yo, ah here we go
Red means stop and green light means go
Common sense dropped cause I truly love the hip-hop
( *beatboxing* ) I even like to beatbox
In the mornin I'm usually yawnin
Then I'm kickin crazy rhymes until the break of dawn and
Cause I know and you know a gun goes bo!
But you didn't know I'm funky like a project ho
Ah yeah to the honeys, slide your number
Cause when it comes to skins I lay my pipe like a plumber
So watch out cause I'm the type of crazy man
First I slam bringin the -

(What is a MC if he can't rap)

Came to catch wreck like a hit and run, run, son
Stay off my diznick, I pack rhymes like guns
Music with rhymes, you know I give the scoop
So calm down troop, I kick rhymes like Timberland boots
With no person who stole a crazy verse and
Bo! Bo! Bo! flash a rhyme with no rehearsin
With the East Coast stylee, live in the West buckwhiley
Drinkin apple juice with the -

Green light
Hold this moment - yes
All this stuff is really fresh
( ? ) center stage I flip on none page
Props grow like the afros on the Barkays
Start my own words, make it original
Satiable, yeah, always willin to get lyrical
So end stalkin that's just Charizma's walkin
I don't play football, so yo stop chalkin
Unless you're a skin with good, good looks
That's overdue like a library book
Mariah may sing dag-diggy-dope, dope
Cause I can't hit the high note
For that matter I get into my pen
Have a bubble bath and then let the dopeness begin
So bump, bump the loop in your mob car, no we don't roll Jeeps
We roll the mob cause on the westside of the street
And let your cat feel heat -

Green light
Back on the track, yo, I'm hungry for the groove
( ? ) I'm in the house like a boob tube
Turn it on, dance y'all, not quite 5000
First I gotta give my brothers pounds and
Blows, don't you know you see I grow like Jack the beanstalk
Take my honey to the park and swing after dark
So follow me now because I didn't come to talk sh-
Neither full of sh-, I came to rip sh- and wreck sh-
I'm a crazy man that rocks the dope jams
I start to slam like Captain Caveman
12 months of the year I'm just flashin
On the pedal mashin ready to bash in
This microphone, so welcome home
Tell, show, show and tell, this is what I've shown -
