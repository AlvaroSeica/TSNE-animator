Song:   Sound of Love
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Every time you hear my music
Feelings I've never had before
You got my head turning baby
Up in the night, ain't gotta look no more
Cause you're what I've been searching for lately
So you're thinking about changing up then boy, you're crazy
Take me to another place and make me your lady
Because I'm ready, damn, boy, I'm ready
To be your one and only girl

You make it hard for me to breathe
Whenever you're around
My heart vibrates every time I sense that you're around
That's the sound of love

Temperature is rising, baby girl I know you like it
When I see your face I get so, so excited
But I don't know what to do, I don't know what to say
Cause you would've been searching for lately
So if you're thinking about changing up, then girl, you're crazy
Take me to another place and make me your baby
Cause girl, I'm ready, damn, girl, I'm ready
To be your one and only man

You make it hard for me to breathe
Whenever you're around
My heart vibrates every time I sense that you're around
That's the sound of love

Let me turn it up a bit, lights on, like that
When we had enough all we do is kiss and get right back
You can take my heart baby, it's yours now, I don't need to fight that
I see you're on me cause nobody made you feel like that
I know you need it, this ain't bleeding, my heart's waiting
Our hearts waiting
Every time we get close, mind, body, soul
If I was the first to say it, baby, would you feel the same, baby?

You make it hard for me to breathe
Whenever you're around
My heart vibrates every time I sense that you're around
It's the sound of love

That's the sound of my heart
It's beating
It's waiting
Just to be loved
I don't know if I'm ready for love
So I don't think I can love you right now</pre>
