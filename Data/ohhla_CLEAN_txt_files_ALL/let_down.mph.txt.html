[Nick Sweepah]
Such a spark, yeah and all that
Great expectations and had to fall flat
Like what this was written on, didn't expect to get shitted on
But you gotta sigh, shrug and keep moving on
Quitting on Sweep shows your character, not deep
And snares from Mobb Deep couldn't be this harsh
But fuck it, it's my way of wading through the marsh
Been a little while between drinks so pass the next one, I'm parched

[Muph]
And when push comes to shove
It feels like a kiss becomes a hug
But if it's just not real love
You may slip from that rug boy
You can't force it, must take the crush and forfeit
Now you're just friends and it feels awkward
Holding your head low, along with your esteeming ego
Feeling morbid, everything seems slow
Got to sort it off the pitch to sit
In the ditch the initial hitch was a risk
And you knew that, wondering why you continue to do that
{Do what?} Let the disappointments affect you
Damn, that shit can really get you down
It can get you down boy
It can get you down, it can get you down

[Chorus] {X2}
Let down! That shit can break, shift and shake
Like tectonic plates it irritates
But we eliminate, throw await away
And elevate for goodness sake

[Nick Sweepah]
Now we had great plans for the title
The show, mixtapes, promotion, CDs and vinyl
Mixing one element that's vital, enthusiasm
Thought you wanted to jump the chasm and meet under the steps we planned it
And then we canned him almost overnight
Seeing if you turn up, still the show was alright
But what about the meeting times, the mad drinking and speaking times
Shouldn't have been relying on you for all those beats and rhymes

[Muph]
Make a little more effort
Captivate and leave 'em breathless, work hard and perfect it
Should never have neglected the ones who were affected
By the words I projected
By the passion I injected, now my objective
is to be tight, make shit just right
Be selective before I let it out of the tavern
I've been let down by so many who've lost that passion
Used to crash and burn with sounds you've never heard
But when she gets heard, the turd loosens
But I won't let the words of disappointment leave me in ruins
I'm chewing on the past, spitting out the present
Got to ignore the let downs so my life can be pleasant
Chewing on the past, spitting out the present
Ignore the let downs so my life can be pleasant
Oh so pleasant

[Chorus] {X2}</pre>
