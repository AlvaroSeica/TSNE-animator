Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus: Young Thug]
I'll shoot at you and yo ho like a porno movie
I'm always high, Call this condo music
And if the girl wanna come, let her in
Word around town is that them young niggas went in
I'm sittin' at the end while you still beginning
I love her friends, I love her friends, oh yeah

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
He ain't came in my spot, Come skatin' under my blocks
Unless you heard, then gettin shot.. Ain't no ho nigga
And even at a concert, I'll show a nigga
Or just like double cells, I'll Po' that nigga
That's my protocol, My word law
My birds soft, My ho a spouse
Feed me, feed me
I don't rap for free, the opposite of free be..
I wanna whole grammy, I wanna hit yo nanny
I'll take another .5 now I'm the last standing
I call him Dominique, cause he stay with that cannon
And he gone sit in your front hard, even if you was stanley

[Chorus: Young Thug]

[Verse 2: Wicced]
I should take a pic all this fly shit I got on
I'm fly, I'm fly, like i been airborne
Yo girl suck me up, She suck me up like she work on porn
It's so hot, It's so hot call her remy like all star
I'll take a Aim and skeet ride in her jaw
You ain't gettin' paper that's a personal problem, it ain't my fault
I'm too focused and level headed, Fill up a money vault
Do try some stupid shit, pull out the stick and come chop 'em out
I'm on 4 different drugs, shit I'm high as a loft
I just buy expensive clothes, fuck what the shit cost
Keep a closet full of work, ain't no such thing as drought
'migo drop 'em off, We get 'em in and we get 'em out

[Chorus: Young Thug]</pre>
