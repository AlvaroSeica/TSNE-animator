Song:   Break It Down
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

Intro: Mellow Max

Yes, as we continue to get it going on
Artifacts representin from Newark to Illtown
Put your ear to this here
Most definitely it's a sure banger
Keep this one in your collection
Newark to Illtown representin
Who do we have up to bat? (MC El)
Lace that

Verse One: El the Sensai, Tame One

In this field, niggaz get killed, quick with the skills
Intact, ill with raps, buildin facts to fill
gaps react, tap into your internet and patch into
my steez or my style, niggaz down to make the cheese wild
MC's get defused cause I'm the bomb specialist
With the wettest, test this, deadly like asbestos
Check the credit set it, so odd they have to call a medic
My paragraphs be off key, that's why niggaz can't get it

For those of you who don't know, my flow keeps MC's
on freeze like Sub-Z doin MK3 fatality
Do remember like Clue, I run up on booty crews
on every weekend buggin out cause I be geekin
Lounge like the peppermint the Boom Skwad President
leaves a tenament resident finding evidence of sedatives
DAILY, scoopin through the Roots like Alex Haley
Beetle Bailey beatdown to a soundman lookin scary
Label secretary terrorizer yet I'ma
fresh rhymer comma bringer of the drama the bomber
From the Lost Lands, off hand claps I run raps
and shatter nigga cyphers into pieces like gun claps

Verse Two: El the Sensai, Tame One

My verbal, patterns reach farther than Saturn
Bustin niggaz up because my rhymes be breakin
atoms stranger, ProForm arranger
Fake U-SA Polo shirt stainer with the tec that's never plainer
indent, that's the men blend trends we make and cross
without the fakin, to the ten niggaz respect we just take it

New jacks relax cause the syntax can't be Xeroxed
Cause I be locked on spots like niggaz movin in from swat
I X more Men out than Elijah, Muhamm Ali of rhyme schemes
Leavin my stickers at the crime scene
Skwad Odd Man, receive response like Roxanne
Battle the top man, and shock fans like I'ma rock band
I cut the mustard and plus I can bust it dusted (what?)
Whatever you fuckin with I touch and leave it busted
My click rips and gets up in ya like the shits
from grits, while yo shit sits like it's on bricks
Tracy Chap raps I laugh at, half-assed rappers
who lack fat tracks get capped at, fuck that

Destroy the masses, niggaz in classes tryin to catch the math
As I sit and think the ink begins to craft
my blueprints instruments workin as I'm jerkin
Your style hurtin in the club your crew nervous rehearsin
In between the cut I run amuck with mad stuff
Niggaz can't touch, escape wack cyphers like handcuffs, so
C'mon and get down with that Artifacts sound
"When I break it down from Newark NJ to Illtown"

Outro: Mellow Max

Word up thank you I think I'm convinced
Cool Mellow Max in the house
Peace to my niggaz Park Ave, Swift-O-Matic yeah!
Boom Skwad in the house how you like it now?
Representin the skills, what?
Chancellor Ave, Avon Ave, nigga where ya at?
Aww man the Bricks!  Newark to Illtown
If ya don't know I think ya better ask
Breakin it down, sizin it up
for the year nine-six, WHAT!!!
