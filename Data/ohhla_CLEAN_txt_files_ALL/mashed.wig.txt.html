[Shawn Wigs]
Verbal classic, watch me peel ya wig past your shoulders
Tie ya legs to bricks, like mafia soldiers
Mash your potatoes, dart me to a poke, like O.J.
Ya'll pancake niggas can't smoke up an oh-say
Iron lungs blowin 'em out, burning the kush
How the fuck did Ghost not get a Grammy off "Tush"?
Fuck the game, I'm about to cup-a-soup it
Got hard with the team, it's a Theodore movement
We green beret soldiers of death, straight road rats
Throwbacks, even if the money's in small stacks
I dart, cuz my heart got, too much to hold
And my mind got thoughts for your body and soul</pre>
