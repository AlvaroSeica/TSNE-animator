Typed by: Cno Evil

[Chorus 2X: King Just]
They know... they can't forget about me
Cuz my flow... been so low

[King Just]
I'm the first platinum harmonized rap from the Stat'
It's like an epidemic cuz I spread across the map
Way back in '93, I dropped my first LP
When half of ya'll couldn't M.C.
Let's see, who can stand the test of time
When half of ya'll don't even write your own rhymes
Blind to the fact that these niggas is wack
They only get over cuz a hot producer did they track
I ain't hating, cuz I'm over you waiting
I'm bout to give these rappers hell, might as well call me Satan
Pentilating, my frustation on a nation
I do what the back of a pencil do and erase 'em
Case closed and throws 'em, because I've arosen
The choice that you chose was the chosen

[Chorus 1.5X]

[King Just]
The living legend is repping, I'm nice with the weapon
Ever since Kane dropped "Ain't No Half Steppin'"
Hip-hop, beggin' my call, so I've answered
Live on stage, without the muthafucking dancers
Cancelled deals that's sold as King Just
Without a cigarette, I still give a headrush
'Cold crush' like I was a 'Force MD'
I ain't gotta say nothing, nigga, talk is cheap
New York streets is mines, cuz I'm taking it back
Laying down the format to show these cats how to rap
I hear that, but most of ya'll is death
On the turnbuckles, screaming 'time-out' towards the ref
Try'nna guard ya left, while I'm steady throwing rights
Brawl til we fall, cuz we all love to fight
The great white hype, should of been Pellegrino
If he's T-Money, who the fuck you think is Nino?
Not a Gambino, and I don't own casino
But I still cop weight from Radamez Encino

[Chorus 2.5X]

[King Just]
Last but not least, I keep it short like briefs
Cuz most hungry niggas gotta eat
Starving artists, who the fuck you think started this?
Selling out the back of the trunk with no marketing
Beg you pardon, son, man, I live where you live
Nigga, did what you did, but I gave back when you didn't give a fuck
About your roots and youth
In the dark there's lies, in the light there's truth
And justice, but ain't that the American way
Watch out for real raps on Veteran's Day
Hear what I say, make this clear to your ear
That this one individual shows no fear
With much more to gain and, nothing to lose
With my ass in your face like the Rikishi move
On the ten o'clock news, screaming "Who You?"
Rick Rude, I eat you like Charleston Chew

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
