[Verse One: June Marx]
My conduct is unsportsmanlike scorch a mic when the sword'll strike
Reporters on recorders on corners at brawler's fight
Author, I write horror type sought with spikes
Metaphors ignite for the offered sight move with the force of life
I stalk the night til the early morning dirty brawling
I  heard the calling and promise to burn until the birds have fallen
Verses storming weapons purchased are foreign wrecking the earth
With arson the reverend church is scorching step in the dirt I'm walking
Repping perilous orphans dr. Jekyll transforming deflecting devilish haunting
Second your reckless talking your flesh and essence dissolving yes I'm a sergeant
Directing the rebellion squadron replenish and sharpen contending I'm sovereign
The end is alarming severing marksman your records are boring heaven is calling
Shells melted the sensitive organ, ending the flossing
element stalking a second left measured your coffin

[Chorus 2X: Lone Ninja]
Wild and vigorous, I prowl in the howling wilderness
Militant, take the crown you frown with bitterness
Style is rigorous these foes fret and then perish
Your doubts is timorous we pose a threat to contestants

[Verse Two: Lone Ninja]
I'm a bad mamma jamma, I don the olive drab balaclava
It's kind of sad you boxers try to jab, I will drop ya
Get clobbered proper I'm  the soldier of fortune
Upholding the warning the boldest will be frozen with caution
Patrolling guardsmen getting struck unexpected
They're pummeled to wreckage I chuckled as they mumbled their death wish
I jump from the terrace and apply the sleeper hold
A troubling menace gouge out eyes in peeper's hole
Lethal and cold I'm a like green beret
with three grenades I'm mean watch you scream in vain
I'm seeking to slay it's survival of fittest
Rivals is dismissed and stifled cause I'm vile and vicious
Guile with a grimace I am not to be trusted
With jolly I've hunted you rowdy, yeah you probably wasn't
Mad vex it's doom I rock and sock 'em
I snap necks and June will cock the shotgun
