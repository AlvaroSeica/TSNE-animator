[KiD CuDi]
Have you ever been to heaven at night? (Night) 
Have you ever been to heaven at night? (Heaven at night)
Have you ever been to heaven at night? 
Closing your eyes, the feeling so right 
At first you might see this one bright beam of light 
Crutching your soul ? 
Happy unites and feelings take flight 
Blinds of the evils you give them no sight 
Focus on floatin, your focus is tight 
Like you be road ass you safe for a class to pass in the night 
Have you ever seen the ending so nice You feel so free like your high as a kite 
Like how you feel if you drink some Bud Lite 
Followed by Jag models we smile then tilt our heads back 
These are a few of the visions I like, mixed in with light 
these are my favorites to dream in the night 
This is my heaven at night
Have you, ever been to heaven at night (Heaven at night) 
Heaven at night (Heaven at night) 
Oh, have you ever been to heaven at night (Heaven at night) 
Heaven at night (heaven at night)
Man, ohh, I need what the world can't give me (Can't give me) 
Can't give me 
Man, ohh, I see what the world can't show me (Can't show me) 
Can't show me, dog, oh, I like what the world can't give me (Can't give me) 
Can't give me, dog, oh, I sing but the world can't hear me (cant hear me) 
Can't hear me...
Heaven at night...
Have you ever been to heaven at night? (Heaven at night) 
Heaven at night (Heaven at night)
Have you ever been to heaven at night?
Heaven at night...</pre>
