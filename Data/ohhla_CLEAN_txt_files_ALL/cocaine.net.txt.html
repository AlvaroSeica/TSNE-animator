[Syd Tha Kyd]
Hey baby
Where you goin?
You look good to me
You look good to me
Walkin by yourself
Maybe I can help

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
I wanna, I wanna
Do you wanna do some cocaine?

[Interlude: Syd Tha Kyd}
Baby just ignore the consequence
You look like you could use a little confidence
So follow me
to fantasies in paradise
And now that you know what this feeling's like
You know you can have it for the rest of your life
Just follow me
Just follow me

[Left Brain]
She high as fuck up in my truck
Shocked up lookin for a bitch to fuck
I'm high on coke
She high on coke
Coast to coast baby float my boat
Got coke to sniff and weed to roast
Post no need to boast
Let's snort

[Syd Tha Kyd]
Two in the back, one in the front
Do yo wanna ride in my car

[Chorus]

[Syd Tha Kid]
Ayy, don't trip
Just try it once
Don't worry (I wanna, I wanna)
Just follow me (I wanna, I wanna)
