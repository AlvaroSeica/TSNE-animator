Sa-noop, Snoopy-Doop, doo, doo dooo

[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
Fredwreck, uhh, uhh, Snoop Dogg
Ye-yeah, ye-yeah
Yeah, nigga quit bullshittin and hit that
Hit the shit man~! Yeah, ahhhh

[Snoop Dogg]
If I do if I don't, if I will if I won't
I mix the C with the P, and live the G with the funk
Got you rappin at school, my nigga acting a fool
He got suspended, now he all alone in his room
playin my CD, la-da-di da-di
Eastside shit, Goldie Loc and big Trey D
On the scene, the young homey wanna be me
So I'm a let him, I hope the homeboys don't get him
Cause they gon' sweat him; gotta stay on deck for that
If you a busta, you gon' get jacked for that
It's so real, homey don't pop that pill
Dip that, now tell me how does that feel?
I cain't stop, gotta go hard in the paint
I cain't fake, nigga put paint where it ain't
Monkey see monkey do, what I say I do
If I take one, you take two

[Chorus: Traci Nelson]
I just wanna let you ride - peer pressure
And get you high - peer pressure
And smoke trees 'til I die - peer pressure
Uhhh
I just wanna let you ride - peer pressure
And get you high - peer pressure
And smoke trees 'til I die - peer pressure
S-N-double-O-P, I just wanna get you right

[Snoop Dogg]
Baby girl wanna be grown
She got a Facebook page and a cell phone
Her daddy gettin money, her momma on the go
She movin too fast, but she really don't know
Life is a trip; lil' momma don't drink that
They tellin you it's cool, baby don't take that
Cause if you do, ain't no tellin
You'se a good girl, why you fightin and rebellin?
If you keep that up you gon' end up spread
Misled - better yet, sick in the head
So stop tryin to be like them and be yourself
Stop, look, and see yo'self
It's so real, gotta stay hard in the paint
You can't fake, baby put paint where it ain't
Monkey see, monkey do, what I say I do
If I take one, you take two

[Chorus]

[Interlude: Traci Nelson]
I love the street life, cause there's no place I can go
Street life, it's the only life I know
Street life, it's the only life I know
Street life, cause there's no place I can go

[Snoop Dogg]
I'm up all night like I'm on +Twilight+
Turn left, turn right, your life, my life
Do wrong, do right, low life, high life
I go green, so why you keep offerin me white?
I cain't stop, gotta go hard in the paint
I cain't fake, nigga put paint where it ain't
Monkey see monkey do, what I say I do
If I take one, you take two

[Chorus]

[Outro: Traci Nelson]
Get you high, smoke weed 'til I die
I just wanna let you ride
And get you high, smoke weed 'til I die
I just wanna let you ride
Ah-ahhhhhhh
Ahhhhhh...
I just wanna let you riii-iii-iii-iii-ii-iide</pre>
