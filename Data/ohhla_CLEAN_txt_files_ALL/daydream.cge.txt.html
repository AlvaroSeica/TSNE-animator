[Cage]
I met this chick in the club 
took her to the telly for back rubs
split a dozen dutches
ate a hundred drugs
we tripping face 
I'm like yo sit on my face
she like "I got a rag unless you like the way it taste"
should I kick you in the cunt?, no?
so pass the blunt
she bend over the bed and said "yo, do what you want"
So I entered like a bull, til the cavity was full
looked down my dick was a knife and I took her life

[chorus 2x]
daydream being a murderer or killer
assassinator, death coordinator, executioner
with a presidential finger
I blow up countries and dead lips my name linger

[Cage]
wake from this nightmare can't even see clear
shooting my grip off through the wall catch my moms in the ear
run downstairs tripped over dead siblings
covered in my sister's blood
fell out the crib limbs
Hanging from chains and red sky wit black rains
Floatin the bodies of the slain cloggin up sewer drains
trying to save the drowning clinging on to
my kayak but I slice off their heads as I battle through
with razor oars, 16 hearts pump darts out of my pores
and killed passersby doors
Perception, close up, keteset cloggin my nose up
see myself in a precinct and my head blows up

[chorus 2x]

[Cage]
So I'm in front of the judge the jury says "you fucked"
"slice his knife with his own fucking wrists..."
     (overlapping) "suck the life out of his eyes.." 
     ("Kill him") till the piece of shit dies
Fuck it do as you will I welcome all flies
I jumped from my seat attacked the judge with his mallet (bam bang bam)
my girl was like "chill Alex"
I bust the judge head til he dead "see you with the worms"
Hung the jury "this court is adjourned"
