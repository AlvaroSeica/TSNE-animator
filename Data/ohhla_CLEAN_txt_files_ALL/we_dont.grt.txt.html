Typed by: AZ Lyrics

(Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on) [x3]

Come on, yeah, here we go
Come on, yeah, somebody hold
Yeah we get down. Yeah!
Bounce around. Blow!
We don't play, we came to get down
We do it like this everyday
Since we the ones that rep our city
Gotta give up to the ones who with me

We don't play. never have, never will
Cuz i got to much to give
i got to much word and this life is to real
Got to be heard and fight for you to feel me</pre>
