Before I start this, I know some of my words may be wrong
and I have a couple question marks as well. If you read this
and have suggestions please e-mail me at (itwasmagic_card@yahoo.ca)
and together attempt to master AZ's every word!

(hook)

rolling down the block pushing something you aint never seen (yeah)
shorty riding shotgun so incredible (so incredible) (gorgeous)
lay back in the ? down gangster lean (I stay chilling daddy,you dig, ha ha)
this feeling is undeniable

(AZ) verse 1

drama seas, sands so white
bahamas beach, your plans go right
out of reach, rambo flights
in some two seater, sitting up like cleavage
plane conceded, the prayer was a parapalegic 
save the chatter, my swagga's needed, believe it
button ups, tailor custom cuts, 
trees on the feet, physique fucks him up
thats whats up
straight from the gutter side
keep clean on everything my mother dries
still I love allah , sucker for southern fries
facing affiliation, embracing my butterflies
I,(I) been down for a minute now
theres none flyer,all the live wires in the ground
a young messaih, admired by entire town
sun-fire, stay higher than Miriah's sound
so you know I'm on some other shit
sneak peak, low creep, deep cover shit

(hook)

rolling down the block pushing something you aint never seen
shorty riding shotgun so incredible
lay back in the ? down gangster lean
this feeling is undeniable

(AZ) verse 2

local wars, coastal brawls, 
if you ball at once, whats the most you saw?
if you fall, do you really got folks to call?
with that bell on hand, why they tell on fam? (sigh)
I feel his pain, how the unfortunate try to steal the fame
how its more naucseousness than the killer in ray 
through so much anger, (clentching jaw) I know such danger
thoro, I'm a decade in
from a borough way wicked than wes craven
then again
certain things I could never do
my whole life, get it right, get revenue
get a wife, get a white BMW
2 doors style, take that roof off now
(ha) that was dreams of a younger me
now my hunger's humongous as a hummer 3
ferarri drop, with that time in the summer T

(hook)

rolling down the block pushing something you aint never seen (never seen)
shorty riding shotgun so incredible (so incredible) (gorgeous)
lay back in the ? down gangster lean (gangster lean)
this feeling is undeniable (deniable)

(AZ) verse 3

I'm unsure, how I felt before
but for now all I ask, is Lord help us all
help me stay focused, I'm self absorbed
and then sunny vibrations, real spot thats spacious
few cases, Julio Englacias
fl
ow from the coop, I'm like Owens in the booth
big boy, had his know from the roof
way before rap, I can more than fall back
all that it's a beautiful zone
I stay mellow like musical tone, (musical tone)

(hook)

Rolling down the block pushing something you aint never seen. (never seen)
Shorty riding shotgun, so incredible. (incredible) (gorgeous)
lay back in the ? down gangster lean (gangster lean)
this feeling is undeniable 

is undeniable
is undeniable
is undeniable

this feeling is undeniable</pre>
