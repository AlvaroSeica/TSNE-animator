[Saul Williams - singing]
We're taking we, we're taking off
I plant the seed, and watch it grow
I plan to reap, the seed I sow
We're taking we, we're taking off
When I go, I'll explore
Beyond life, all that we know
To unfold, the untold
All the mysteries yet to be known
I want to go up like a rocket in the sky
Beyond every doubting eye
And I'll reach, what I seek
Yes yes the stars began to speak
When I take off like a
Rocket, rock, rock, ah-rock rocket {*4X*}

Rocket in the sky
You think drugs can get you high
But I know, that my soul
is so beyond substance control
Watch me take off like a rocket in the night
Beyond history implied
We will dance while soldiers fight
And explode into the night
Watch me take off like a
Rocket, rock, rock, ah-rock rocket {*4X*}

Rocket, I'm in space
And the darkness knows my face
Every stratus states its case
And an angel takes her place
And we take off like a rocket in your heart
Every ending has it's start
And with love like yours and I
All it takes is just one spark
And we'll take off like a
Rocket, rock, rock, ah-rock rocket {*4X*}

Watch me take off like a
Rocket, rock, rock, ah-rock rocket {*2X*}

We're taking we, we're taking off
I plant a seed, and watch it grow
I plan to reap, the seed I sow
We're taking we, we're taking off
Rocket, rock, rock, ah-rock rocket {*4X*}</pre>
