[Chris Ward]
It's graduation time, and no disrespect to Don
But tonight, I'm the Louis Vuitton don
I got my shades and my shoes, by Louis Vuitton on
My skully and my scarf, by Luis Vuitton hon
You see my wristwatch, my Luis Vuitton arm
I went and got some money, and gave Louis Vuitton some
So for the moment, I'm Louis Vuitton's son
Ghetto spokesman, on 84 spokes man
Let me take a second, to tell you just how I do
I'm so fresh, everytime you see me it's like deja vu
Boo it's true, young C-Wizzly
Rocking a pinky ring, big enough to fit a grizzly
Nigga you can hate, but your bitch steady watching
The rocks in the watch, got your bitch steady watching
The rocks in the chain, got your bitch steady rocking
I grind full time, on the clock steady clocking
 
[Hook]
Nigga you can hate, but your bitch steady watching
Nigga-nigga you can hate, but your bitch steady watching
Nigga-nigga you can hate, nigga-nigga you can hate
Nigga-nigga you can hate, but your bitch steady watching
Nigga you can hate, but your bitch steady watching
Nigga-nigga you can hate, but your bitch steady watching
Nigga you can hate, but your bitch steady watching
Bet you can't do it, on the dick she bopping
 
[Big Pokey]
Nigga you can hate, but your chick got a crush
Everytime the kid talk to her, she gotta blush
Yeah I know you love her, but you bet not trust her
And you bet not try me, cause the crock bull'll flush ya
Send her back home, call on her on the phone
Sometimes I just text her, tell her bring her ass on
Naw I ain't gon' gal her, you can handle that
All I'ma do is scoop her up, and dismantle that
She say she like my stees', she see me with my ice on
She say she like my freeze, the kid counting cheese
Stop hating on me homie, give me fifty feet
When I'm finished with ya, they gon' think that I was fifty deep
Rolled a three point five, in a swisha sweet
Put it in the air, and blew it in her hair
One hand on the wheel, but her hand down there
An eye for an eye, that's how we play it round there
 
[Hook]
 
[Slim Thug]
I'm in that new Benz, with the new plates
And if you try to jack, I'ma catch a new case
My watch bright white, with the blue face
It's my time to shine, haters you too late
Your bitch steady watching, she already bopping
Trying to audition for me, she wanna get it popping
You can't knock her though, cause I'm a fly guy
She saying hi to me, and waving at you bye-bye
I know you haters hate me, but it don't frustrate me
I only confrontate with ya marks, when you make me
It ain't my fault, your grilfriend wanna lick me down
It ain't my fault, your sister want the Boss to dick her down
And yeah I hit your broad, but I ain't rape her though
I beat it last night, she calling me today for mo'
I be damned, if I let you haters take my glow
I'ma ball hard, and make ya hoes hate me mo'
