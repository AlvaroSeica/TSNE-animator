Song:   All the Kings Men
Typed by: Cno Evil

[Chorus: Timbo King]
Of course it's the Royal, put the horses in the stable
All the kings men, fucking up your turntables
We strike over night, day time it's even worser
All the kings men, out to hurt ya, hurt ya!

[Mikey Jarrett]
Yes, we come again, all the kings men
In position, to reject the tension
We run the engine, start and begin
Make me sure to water them with off timing
Long riding, I'm implying
If you pretend, crack, and I will bend
Ya jaw red, and you like one bag of wind
Waiting to hear 'Royal Fam nah win'
So just step in, cock rampin'
You kill us, heard dem boy, you left and then ripped
Just be who you are, and you can overcome
When things get hard, praise to the almighty God so far
It's been love, hide us and protection from the heavens above
When shit get rough, so weak want tough
You gain nuff respect, soldier never let
No boy disrespect, my intellect
Own this mic check, sound boy, just step

[Benny Boom]
My rap style aggression, keeps niggas guessing
Learn your lesson, when will fake MC's stop testing?
The terminator frame nigga with the bombing
Every time an MC done and step.. the Boom they blame
My humility, makes me not wanna boast
But I got that shit that's hot at night like Rae &amp; Ghost
My anger, I bring it like a potent hooded stranger
I'm not Harrison Ford, but I'm 'Clear &amp; Present Danger'
I know where MC's, get beheaded by the Kings'
County niggas, representing with crowns and rings
Army fatigued, the ghetto breed, rhyming with the blaze in our mouth
Yo, but, the tongue will never bleed, are you ready?
For the dope shit that the Boom is putting in you
Rhyming takes my heart, yes, my nerve, yes, my tenure
Wack rappers change ya venue
Benny Boom, Royal Fam, yes the saga will continue

[Dark Knight]
All my kings men, got this rap shit under pressure
The Dark Jester won't settle for nothing lesser
Cuz Uncle Sam, don't give a damn about the black man
All my kings men, all my kings men

I'm king like Arthur, fuck ya'll niggas, don't even bother
My shit cause more ruckus than ass kickings from ya father
Focus ya thoughts, cuz in my courts ya just a jester
I said it, fuck with the 7th Sign, and get beheaded, yo
This is the live shock, nigga, this ain't no fable
I conduct peers, on how all you duck punk nigs off roundtables
I sent 4 million to '70, forward in your day
When I come back with dope tracks, fuck the Alize
I boogie to bang, for my Camelot gang
Riding horses, fuck The Source, kids, it's mics in hands
At a thousand paces, I raise the eyes of a fucking sparrow
Make glocks outta rocks, cuz I can't fuck with those bows and arrows
The roughest nigga from in ya God damn sector
Kings men, coming to get ya, pussies dare not enter
Who sent ya, give us no problem, fuck the hassle
Rhyme directive: kill and destroy, guard the castle

[Chorus] </pre>
