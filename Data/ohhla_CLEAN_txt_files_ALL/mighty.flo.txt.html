[Nottz]
Lil' nigga, I'm a muh'fuckin monster, I drool when I talk
Shit crumble and die throughout the paths I done walked
Eyes stay blood red 'cause I ain't slept in a hundred years
I'm one vampire that bust heads, get tough guy
Thinkin you can fuck wit the boy {UH UH, DEM LIE!}
Nuff dem die and fry for that shit, dig it? {DIG IT? Dig it? dig it?}
Now what yo' GOD-damn problem is?!
{*gun clicks*} I ain't think so, bitch!
Sitcho' monkey ass on down 
Before I putcho' monkey ass on down like you went wild from a zoo {*monkey screeches, gunshot*}
Nottz Raw ring bells from here to Kalamazoo
You ain't gotta like my shit! Nigga, FUCK YOU~!
Listen, there's a big enough muh'fuckin opinions that means somethin
And a fourth of that be frontin
The other 75% fuck with that real hip-hop
Bitch stop - HOL' UP befo' a nigga go nuts!

[Chorus: cuts and scratches by DJ Flash]
"Real niggaz only" "5'9""
"I be the five-star gener-real"
