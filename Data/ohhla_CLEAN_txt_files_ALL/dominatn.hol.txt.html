[Irie 1]
Meet at Ground Zero, back to the lab
Packs on our shoulders with the pen and the pad
You won't catch me without a fresh rhyme in can
Dissected from my brain, for you to understand
The, poetry in motion, moving with sound
My words are like an ocean and I'm already drowned
I'm stuck in the deep, everything beyond my reach
So I put my head from want to get, lost in the beat
You need to practice what you preach, word, don't follow what you teach
When the people listen, depends on who you trying to reach
This is the trial, struggles, trials and tribulations
Things we have tought from the moment of creation
Now word is bond, on a brand new day
We break bread daily with heads around the way
I just ain't got time to live forever
As the world turns, it don't get much better

[Chorus 4X: Pro the Leader]
Domination, crush the opposition
Why you living? Really, you need to stop rapping

[Holocaust]
Have you had these crushes burning like a flame in your heart
You die in the dark, I crash like a shark, the fire arm spark
When a dying soldier departs, to those of who have been wounded and hurt
Disappointed by someone, just honesty and evil work
To all of those of you who were facing death
Or endless that unfurl, man, that can not understand
That his mission was to invite them to the kingdom of God
Which is not of this world
I relax with a new evil bat and smoke a blunt
You die in this chain night, nervous locked his keys in his trunk
Please know that the Lord does not like that
Our time on Earth is very limited
But my black heart yearns for you to know him in it
Do you know the militant?
You trip and fall on the Island like Gilligan
There are others of you who perhaps have been in churches
Where you can condemn for you weakness, son, from making poor choices
God has a place for all die to angel voices
The pain and weakness you experience in this life, reveal to us
Our need for grace, and not realization
We only need to turn to the grave

[Chorus 4X]

[Mic Moses]
Too many pity cats, kicking them same shitty raps
This is the gritty match, and I'm bringing my city back
Watch the evil hole, digging motivated monster
Focused on the mission, bringing the cannons like Contra
The death of the cave, survive and nice forum
Is not enough to keep you safe from the vibe of this world
Commited fam on the rise, the general stay wise
Building an enterprise, and ready to change lives

[Chorus 4X]</pre>
