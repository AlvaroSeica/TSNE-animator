[Intro: Inspectah Deck (whispering)]
Elevation (x15)

[Chorus: Inspectah Deck]
Tired of trials and tribulations
It seems like life is Hell, dreams the only way of escapin
to worlds that's beyond imagination
I know a place, I could take you there through elevation

[Inspectah Deck]
Where I come from young ones pump jums for lump sums
Bustin guns, trust none, become son
Truth spells broke loose shells that propel
Where I'm dwellin, niggaz bail, tellin what you sellin
My nigga Tone just came home but improvised
The system tried to give him 5 more for gettin high
Fly Stacy, daddy's little lady fucks crazily
Wavy after baby, lost the shape fancy lately
Used to spend the quiet nights home, now she likes to roam
Feelin quite grown, caught in like cyclones
I was taught be the wise of glide and I'll impass
to advance, learn the science of life and earn the masters
Trapped in the havoc, I'm forced to go the whole
Although, it might spell a jail cell and no parole
I fight with the force of Steve Austin
Until my arms can no longer hold off the coffin
In this ghetto Heaven, God bless the children
Whose shattered dreams are offered and hard to mend
We don't believe in Heaven, we livin in Hell
Tryin to escaped, but fate's sealed in the bomb shell
Feelin like U'ey, he knew they would pnat the plot
When high-tech surveillance got my moves on watch
So, I drop jewels, use the music to educate
Can't celebrate 'til we elevate

[Chorus]</pre>
