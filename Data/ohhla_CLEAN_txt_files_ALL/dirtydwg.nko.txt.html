"Never ever think of jerkin me"	--&gt; Greg Nice

[ Jordan Knight ]
You should have treated me right
But you left me lonely and cold at night
Since you won't, someone will
Treat me better and be for real

[ NKOTB ]
If you didn't want it, you shoulda let me know
But since you didn't want it, then girl, you got to go
You left me sad and lonely, and ran away from home
So since I'm not your only, then go and fetch your bone

[ Jordan Knight (+ NKOTB) ]
Cause you'se a (dawg)
Dirty dawg (dawg) dirty dawg (dawg)
Ooh, you're a dirty, dirty (dawg)
Dirty dawg (dawg) dirty dawg (dawg)
Ooh, you're so dirty, dirty

"Never ever think of jerkin me"

[ Jordan Knight ]
I gave you all that I can
Till I caught you swingin with another man
But this time you strayed too far
Now you come beggin like the dog you are

[ NKOTB ]
If you didn't want it, you shoulda let me know
But since you didn't want it, then girl, you got to go
Don't think that you can play me, and jerk me all around
You used to be my lady, now your ass is in the pound

[ Jordan Knight (+ NKOTB) ]
(Dawg)
Dirty dawg (dawg) dirty dawg (dawg)
Ooh, you're a dirty, dirty (dawg)
Dirty dawg (dawg) dirty dawg (dawg)
You're so damn dirty

[ Greg Nice ]
Yo (Yo) Why you wanna act like a tramp (tramp)
A wet food stamp?
I think it's time for me to break camp
Had a crush on my man the first time we met
Now what you see is what you get
I lost more than a mill on a gambling bet
So here's the chuckwagon for the dog in you
Here's the KennelRation and the Alpo, too
[ Smooth B ]
Now you know I didn't want her
She tried to back me in a corner
Told her blow the horn like little Jack Horner
Forever forbidden
The fast girls in life, the fast cars, they call 'em kittens
Now they've been known to amaze
But they can't pull one over on me, I got game for days
Save the sap rap for the handicapped
Been around the block and I didn't fall for the dirty trap

[ Jordan Knight (+ NKOTB) ]
(Dawg)
Dirty dawg (dawg) dirty dawg (dawg)
Ooh, you're a dirty, dirty (dawg)
Dirty dawg (dawg) dirty dawg (dawg)
Ooh, you're so damn dirty
