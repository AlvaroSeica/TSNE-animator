Typed by: Davida.b.

[J-Boo]
Yeah, I wanna get away where the skies are blue
All night, make love on the beach with you
Laid back, counting the stars up in the sky
Playing with my hair slowly while caressing my theighs
So hot, so hot, off of life and love
Got me stuck like a cloud in the skies above
I'm so in love, let's just get away, I had to get away
From the pain and the stress that I feel everyday
And everyday is like a dream come true
Can't you see it in my eyes when I look at you?
I know you do boo, cuz the vibe is strong
And I'ma keep loving you till I'm dead and gone
These words can't express how I feel for you
There's a burning deep inside that I only get from you
So for now, I gotta lay back and chill
Close my eyes, cuz this getaway is so real

[Chorus: Madam Scheez]
Take me away, I wanna fly for now
Need to escpae, get away some how
Can't ease my prime, got need to shine
Find space and time for beats and rhymes
Take me away, can't ease my prime
Gotta get more, I was born to shine
Cross a thin line, it ain't hard to find
I space and time for beats and rhymes

[Ill Knob]
Would you like to escape all the pressures of the world?
All the heat from the streets and the stress from your girl?
No more police in your face on the concrete
No more guns, no beef, no sleep
Or should I say rest, take a break from the tech
Twenty four seven, mic check, God bless
Don't worry bout currency, money meanin less
Health is your wealth, and babies are the best
The presidency is for every wannabe
Where they wanna be, how they wanna be
I feel you, you the one I'm talking too
Holla at me, holla back, tell me what you wanna do
Or better yet, Ill Knob gon tell you what we gonna do
Go to ?City Island?, eat food by the bundle boo
And live life through the stress and the sight
It's trife, be we gon make it so damn right

[Chorus]

[N-Tyce]
Forrest Gump said life was a box of chocolates
Kinda hard to pick spots to rock with
Can't stop the prophet
I was a little girl learning till I copped illogics
Now I got what I need to succeed in life
If only you'll belive you'll achieve in life
But I need to escape every now and then
Tired of breathing the air that I'm surrounded in
Different atmosphere, new scenery
Feel like I'm dissin where I'm from, I don't mean to be
I love Caroline and green grasses
Cows supplying milk and clean pastures
It's a beautiful thing
To be on a certain high only music can bring
Don't matter where I'm goin or strive to be
Baby, close your eyes, come ride with me

[Chorus]</pre>
