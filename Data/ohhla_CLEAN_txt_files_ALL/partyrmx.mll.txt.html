[Intro: Fabolous]
Hey Meek Milli, is my niggas there? (Yeah!)
Is there some bitches there? (Yeah!)
Is that Ciroc there? (Yeah!)
(*WOO! WOO!) Well let's go

[Verse One: Meek Mill]
I tell her meet me in the bathroom, hold up, better yet my bedroom
I call that my V.I.P. fuck a bad bitch get some head room
If I score hot and hug her friend, I'm callin it and one
If I murdered that front and back, I'm callin it red rum
Red Rum! All these bad hoes in my sight
I see bad hoes to my left, I see bad hoes to my right
And they like SHOTS! SHOTS! SHOTS! SHOTS! Loso bring that box of Ciroc
Mac go bring some O.G. and we 'gon party ladi da
Wale say he on his way I'm black Cobain I'm D.O.A. 
MMG We in this bitch we party hard now we don't play
We stackin chips like Frito Lay, flexin on these mu'fuckers
I walk in the buildin and I'm fresher than a mu'fucker (Mu'fucker)
Shorty bad (Shorty bad) Yet she a star (She A star)
I tell her bring it back like a DVR (DVR)
Ain't nobody leavin, 'cause we too far
I tell her my dick can't breathe and she 'gon give me CPR

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Ciroc all on my table, bitches in the living room
They 'gon ask you the door! What you tryin to get into
I'm with me and my niggas tell her bring a friend or two
Bottles poppin models watchin all up in my living room
Welcome to my house party-party!!!

[Verse Two: Fabolous]
I sent one big room, full of real niggas
Bunch of bad bitches (Whoa!) Here's some chill niggas (Whoa!)
Crib out in Bel Air, no Uncle Phil nigga
So I take 'em in +The Basement+ and yeah I feel Tigger
I don't hear niggas corny raps yeah I feel Jigga (Whoa!)
You lil' niggas do whatever make you feel nigger
Everytime I'm 'round y'all, somethin's a lil' fishy
I smell, I smell, I smell PUSSY!!!
What's your name? Where your from? Almost done with interview
I'm into havin intercourse is that's somethin that interest you
Yes, no, maybe so, baby bro, fix me up
Real house party shit now hold up your Dixie cups
(Get 'em up!) With your other hand, do me a fuckin favor
(Get 'em up!) Put a middle finger up and say fuck the neighbors
Then fuck the haters, they never invited
They can't get on my level my level is private
(WOO!) Who fly more than me my level is pilot
(WOO!) My pockets stay fat, I'm never on diet
(NICE!) Don't be stuntin out of town when you get off
I'll do you like Kid and whip your ass when you get home boy!

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Welcome to my house party-party!!! Welcome to my house party-party!!!  
Welcome to my house party-party!!! Welcome to my house party-party!!!  

[Verse Three: Wale]
Hol' up, this gon' be one vicious flow, show me what it's hittin fo'
Promise if I kill her pussy, I'll send you home in a Ghost
And we on yo, Burberry my winter coat
Germantown my older bitch, she call me her youn'n jawn
Kick game and on Cali bud, I'm fuckin with plenty BUT
Got a new Lorraine, she got her a Sidney jump
MMG, and we out, couple blunts, deep as fuck
Haters love to talk you down when bitches always speak you UP~!
Maybach, bitch we the winnin team
How can I illustrate, you drawlin if you ain't with me
Ballin like I'm in that league, flossin out, yo' bitch gon' leave
Party at the L-I-V, y'all gon' be like this shit O.D.!
(Ha) Mansion party, yeah, they on the couches
Most of 'em got no conscience, I promise I keep a condom
E'ry Friday new polish, shawty fly but she modest
Double-M-G, money speakin, bet you tired of talkin
Wale!

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Ciroc all on my table, bitches in the living room
They 'gon ask you the door! What you tryin to get into
I'm with me and my niggas tell her bring a friend or two
Bottles poppin models watchin all up in my living room
Welcome to my house party-party!!!

[Verse Four: Mac Miller]
Uh, you only gettin one shot, I hope your picture take (take)
Bitch I'm spittin on this remix like I'm Kid &amp; Play (Play)
You know I'm gettin laid like I'm Vincent Chase (Chase)
I'm thinkin 'Ye should hit me up to say, "That shit is cray~!"
Off the backboard, playa, I enjoy the bank (bank)
Plus my people smokin on them pack of noise complaint (WOO!)
I murder beats and get away, it's First 48
But this the house of +Love+ homie, word to Courtney's place
Tw-tw-twenty racks a night, that's on merchandise (WOO!)
I'm rollin up this killer, sippin purple Sprite (Sprite)
Party hard then head to Europe on a early flight (flight)
Walking 'cross the +London Bridge+, that's that Fergie life 
White BOY~! Gone WILD~! 
Every time I do a show it's like the Pope in town
And I call my girl Titanic how she go down
Hope she don't drown, bitch (SHE'S DOWN)

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Welcome to my house party-party!!! Welcome to my house party-party!!!  
Welcome to my house party-party!!! Welcome to my house party-party!!!  
Ciroc all on my table, bitches in the living room
They 'gon ask you the door! What you tryin to get into
I'm with me and my niggas tell her bring a friend or two
Bottles poppin models watchin all up in my living room
Welcome to my house party-party!!!
