Song:   U Don't Want it With Us
Typed by: Cno Evil

[Buddha Monk]
It's I for sure, who leave blocks and bleed nots
Don't need the cops, if need by, believe these rocks
My team don't need evacuate cash and beef wit spots
Like you bleeding for ya life, wit a strong breathing from ya heart
G wind, down ya crew, wipe the smile off of you
Whip the smack from the ruger, knocking the feeling out your tooth
Turn man to RuPaul, name now boo
Your safer that way wit the bitch now you
Games I don't play, I take aim and spray away
Shortness, what is the total population that way?
Stay out of way, I don't mind deleted mistakes
With gun aids, that clear ways and leaving ones brainless

[Chorus 2X: Buddha Monk]
Ya'll don't really, want it with us
But do you think that you want it with us?
My squad love dealing with all you thugs
We don't play that, just cock back and lay men

[Buddha Monk]
You a bad boy, cock that back, blast that ass boy
I lift ya shit for real, so you get it up, boy
I got them thangs that turn bodies over
Pull out the ring from that, that make bodies soil
Show ya'll real love, but ya'll covered in mud
But you said she was a real thug, before you real fuck
Leave no witnesses, so they can't say who killed what
That thought under the rug, from the top of meat slug
Fifteen to what, man, we do nuts
Cuz anything under the sun, gets the short from my gun
This is how the east was won, we creep, never run
Lick my sheez in anyone, ya'll really don't want none, huh

[Chorus 2X]

[Buddha Monk]
We roll in Brooklyn, make that ass a soul in Brooklyn
Body parts might be what's on the stove cooking
Tender meat looking at, good looking out
No evidence, gloves on, so no central booking
Only drugs tooken, plugging your women, counting those dead presidents
Head to the next regiment, for the cash settlement
Red Cross them Blue Shields, hardly in lotto
20 inch wheels, I peel from the kill, I dare someone to squeal
Then this be another kill, no reveal, only blood spill
Yellow tape around the kill, detector filled with donut meal
Me watching the news, hate you
Can't make a face for the kills, so they wait for another kill

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
