[Intro: Ty Dolla $ign] + (DJ Mustard)
Ohhhhh (yeah!) Dolla $ign!
(Y'all know who I am, right?)
{"Mustard on the beat, ho~!"} (Let's go!)

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
I see two of my bitches in the club
And I know they know about each other...
I think these bitches tryna set me up
Maybe Iâm just paranoid...

[Ty Dolla $ign] + (DJ Mustard)
I got a bad light skin from Cali (what)
She be in the club with all baddies (yeah)
Little momma used to be my main bitch (yeah)
But now we donât speak the same language (let's go!)
I love my bitch, I could bang it
But my dark skin bitch know how to take dick (what)
Yeah, she wear the red bottoms all night
You never heard of Dolla $ign, bet you will now (everybody turn up, c'mon~!)
I tell 'em both of my bitches drive Range Rovers... (yeah.. whassup)
None of my bitches eat leftovers... (nah)
Both of my bitches look good as fuck... (what)
Your bitch look like a boogawolf... (let's go!)

[Chorus] w/ ad-libs

[Interlude: Ty Dolla $ign]
Yeah, Iâm paranoid, Iâm trippin'
Iâve been smokin', Iâve been sippin'
Iâm fuckin' around with two bitches
But I never made them hoes my missus

[Trey Songz] + {DJ Mustard}
TRIGGA! (TRIGGA!)
Got bad Spanish bitches in Miami (WOOOO!)
Shit, all the bitches Spanish in Miami (WOOOO!)
I'm gettin' pussy like I am me (yeah)
Hatin' ass niggas can't stand me {hah}
Flown cross country out to Cali
Work it out like Bally's
Introduced the hoes to my homies
Titties feelin' all silicone {dang!}
All of my bitches play sleepover... {what'cha say Trey? What'cha say?}
And then we fuck, and then we bust and do the sheets over
And then we fuck and then we fuck and then we bust
None of my bitches wanna fuck with you... {nah}
All of my bitches eat pussy too.. yes they do {let's go!}

[Chorus] + [Interlude]

[French Montana] + {DJ Mustard}
How we do it? MONTANA~!
Ty, it's Taylor Gang - HAAAH~!

If I gave a fuck about a bitch, I'd always be broke (uh-huh)
I'd never have no motherfuckin' indo to smoke
I get in with +Toony+, niggas actin' +Looney+ (HAH!)
Do you, let your girl do me
Now I got a bitch out in Oakland, got a bitch in the A
Got a bitch out in Portland, got a bitch in the Bay
Got a bitch out in Queens, got a bitch in the Valley
I be reppin' the East, while I'm smokin' in Cali {let's go!}
HAH! Manage shit, head gettin' risky (risky)
Feelin' like Short with bitches (BIATCH!)
Paranoid, rolla toya
Now I'm ballin' like A.I. on the Hoyas (swish!) benches moya
High gettin' bent
Bitches catchin' paranoid, must be the Hen
Then again, I be pimpin' like Hugh Heff (WOO!)
Seen two of my bitches two step {let's go!} ... MONTANA~!

[Chorus] w/ ad-libs

[Outro: DJ Mustard]
Now this is what I want y'all to do - hands up, everybody come on!
Hands up! Hands up!
If you came to fuckin' party - hands up!
Hands up! Hands up!
If you came to fuckin' party - hands up!
Now just rock! Just rock!
If you came to fuckin' party just rock!
Now just rock! Just rock!
