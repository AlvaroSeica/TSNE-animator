And the Starz come out tonight
And the Starz come out tonight
And the Starz come out tonight
And the Starz come out tonight

Yo girl I have been peepin you for quite some time
I finally got the nerve to see if you could be mine
we could go and smoke some trees eat some dinner, drink wine
talk about your mind frame cause the starz is out, and baby you so fine
I just hope you got a different mentality
seen a lot of places and a lot of nationalities
yo turn it up, everywhere is the same
different people, different places, diffent spaces, different races
but everbody is still playin them same games
it got so bad I started doin the same thing
but anyway we can talk over lunch
if you dont slumber yo here's my number

And the Starz come out tonight
And the Starz come out tonight
And the Starz come out tonight
And the Starz come out tonight

Hey yo I like the way you dress, oh yo thats fresh
hey yo I like the way you undress too you impress ooh
and you'll always be my boo
unless your ass is untrue, and you know we through
no more play the fool ?
we go shoppin if you cook some au gratin
you on the team if you cook some greens, True
my mom and pops taught me how to cook too
the only one I want to be with is you
what it look like, and it look like you lookin at me
yo, take a trip and see how things could be

And the Starz come out tonight
And the Starz come out tonight
And the Starz come out tonight
And the Starz come out tonight</pre>
