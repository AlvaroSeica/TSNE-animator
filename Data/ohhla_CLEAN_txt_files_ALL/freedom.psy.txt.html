[Chorus: Duke]
The time has come for some freedom
End of the revolution, we won
If we don't get what we want we fight on

[Sick Jacken]
War pigs retire, arms and cease fire
Law dogs pick up their slain troops, expired
Gave up the ghost in hopes of keeping ropes tied
Tight around our necks, no respect so they died
Those on my side risk their lives for the grand prize
Freedom in the eyes of those fed lies, we rise
Who opposed demised, we rebelled, the foes fell
War criminals get shipped to cells
Cuz they failed to let honor dwell, in their battallion or personel
Righteous absence instill hell to battle tales
Veterans flashback the attack on occasion
Remembering the first and last days of the invasion

[Chorus: Duke]
The time has come for some freedom
End of the revolution, we won
If we don't get what we want we fight on

[Sick Jacken]
This is our first day of freedom, the war's over, we beat 'em
People react to the way you treat 'em
You treat us hostile with raw style, but look now you lost out
Count your casualties, everything you lost is ours now
We walk out of tragedy thinking how could we possibly
Go through all those years acting savagely, battling the war years
Rebelling against those telling us we must trust rival weapons
Fighting for peace looking for that serene dream
Replace bombs with small explosions of mellow scenes
In the post-war era we do whatever it takes
Put our lives at stake to break sick weather, making lives better
Preventing lost cities from turning to gardens of stone
We roam in ruins and broken down homes, war repercussions
Freedom for now, the next step's reconstruction

[Chorus: Duke]
The time has come for some freedom
End of the revolution, e won
If we don't get what we want we fight</pre>
