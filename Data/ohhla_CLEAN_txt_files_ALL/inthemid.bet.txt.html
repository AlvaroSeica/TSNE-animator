Typed by: kirenamloh@msn.com

Just go from right there..
Oooh, yeah...

[Chorus] 
In the middle of the game, don't change the play 
You know you was sweet to catch him, to keep him - keep it that way!  
In the middle of game, don't change the play 
You know you were good to the last drop, don't stop - keep it that way!  

[Verse One: Betty Wright]
Give her breakfast in bed sometimes 
Tell her that she's been on your mind 
Take her out somewhere nice to eat 
Put a pair of Jimmy Choo's on her feet 
Stop nagging on him all the time 
Start bragging on him sometime 
Go some places that he wants to go 
And make him think that he runs the show  

[Chorus]
In the middle of the game, don't change the play 
You know you was sweet to catch her, to keep her - keep it that way!  
In the middle of game, don't change the play 
You know you were good to the last drop, don't stop - keep it that way!  

[Verse Two: Betty Wright] 
Make sure there's gas in the car 
Give her money to go to the spa 
And she'll never forget who you are 
In fact, you'll be a super star 
When his friends are watching sports in the den 
Get in the kitchen, hook him up something 
And even if you cain't cook nothing 
Have a little take-out brought in (oww~!) 

[Chorus]

[Interlude]
You better keep it that way
You ought to keep it that way
You better keep, you ought to keep
Keep it that way
You better keep it that way
You ought to keep it that way
You better keep, I said keep
Keep it that way

[Bridge]
Why do they always have to change? 
When you're wearing their ring, and you're bearing their name? 
(Whooo-hooo!) Why can't it stay like when it was new? 
Cause if you deserve me, preserve me 
I'll be all that I can be to you, ohh
Ohh-ohh-ohh! (Don't change!)
Ohh-ohh-ohh-ohh! (Don't change!)
Ohh-ohh-ohh-ohh-ohh-ohh-ohh-ohhhhhh!
