[Werd]
Edinburgh its ma life
Say what you want cause I do what I like
Healthy and am doing fine
So you do yours cunt I'll do mine (x2)

[Werd]
No money you must do it for a laugh
But thats no funny if am rapping for cash
(Fucking right) See I'm writing my past
And its no right that you write this trash
(Get smashed) Av been doing it since eleven
(Its what it is) honestly, am just trying to make living
(Yeah its true) I'm just trying to make them listen
And live life like am trying to go prison
(Fucking listen) I am not in a band
This is not just music you do not understand
(So don't speak) Who you yelling at man
I have your whole fucking face like the elephant mans
(Ya fucking raj) See this is more than music
This is ya chance to be more than useless
(Something more) Can't be fucked with you liars
So please stand back while I aim a little higher

[Werd]
Edinburgh its ma life
Say what you want cause I do what I like
Healthy and am doing fine
So you do yours cunt I'll do mine (x2)

[Werd]
I'm back had to do it myself
No producer no nothing I do it as well
(Cunt its true) And your feedback is harmless
Say what you want I do my shit regards
(Check it out) See I do it with swagger
I bubble up like a fresh pint of lager
(I got knife) So don't give me daggers
(Get a life) Or I'll take yours after
(Is it true?) Or is it pretend
Got one question do you really want to ken
(Want to ken) See we are the people
And not the Huns mate no me and Deeko
(Me n Deek) But he said thats a weak flow
I said know 
Fuck it I am heat though
On beat so what if I speak slow
Its just talk take a walk if you think so

[Werd]
Edinburgh its ma life
Say what you want cause I do what I like
Healthy and am doing fine
So you do yours cunt I'll do mine (x2)</pre>
