Typed by: Cno Evil

[Remedy]
Yo, the word on the street is that hip hop's dead
Or a dead man walking with a million on his head
This is fortified bread, nobody cares
They preserve money, black and white millionaires
It came from the top, what they saying is mutiny
Family ain't family no more, not what it used to be
Searching for the answers, through all the scrutiny
I wish we could turn back time, speaking truthfully

[King Just]
Liar, liar, pants on fire
Keep the party going, keep it heated like a dryer
Call me a sire, can't no higher
Won't stop rocking til I retire
Made it through the barbwire, by the hole in the fence
He had beef in the hood and we ain't seen him since
Left the prints on the gun like the beat to the drum
You wanna battle at the war, you need better aim, son

[Lounge Lo]
I move with a tabernacle, get tackled
Stone Gang hit you in your Adam apple
Staten Island, been there, done it and come off
Ask E. Sermon, who took his chain off
Out the blue, my dudes from the New and
Ain't nothing changed, this is what we doing
Fuck boys, too young to touch toys
Me, I bust back like your heard enough noise
Pothead, and the block said I'm hot head
Out there, slinging rocks for that gwop bread
L.I. angerer, S.T.O.N.
Yeah, I got a gun, but you can't hold him
But hold a shell as if you owe Kim
And that's my sister, I kill you, Mr.
It's The Genuine Article, a small particle
And that's the shit that B.Z.W.

[Remedy]
Another casualty, acid leaking out the battery
Dash that, trash that, raps automatically
Otherwise tragedy, move half hazardly
Body part darts ricochet through the anatomy
(The hood) is where they sell crack cocaine
Might stick a brother up for his watch and chains
(The 'burbs) is where they sell pills and heroine
Do a blast, wired up like Baltimore, Maryland

[King Just]
My description, ammunition, ambition, Hell's Kitchen
Got a pot to piss in, darts spitting
Hard hitting, duck-chicken, finger linger
Muzzle mitten, puff piffing, rhyme bitten
Time ticking, line blitzing, the offense
Staten Island sharks, you Miami Dolphins
Put 'em in a coffin, lay 'em to rest
J-U-S, anything after that is stress</pre>
