Get my mothafuckin hands on this Beat (Yeah Nigga) 
I Told ya I was gonna get my hands on this Beat (word up) 
Ima go 113 bars (On some real Hip Hop shit) 
113 (lets go! ) 
Ima fighta not a Lover 
Yous a lover not a fighta Pai
Im getting Real Swole
Like I had a lot of Spider bites 
Now throw your hands Up 
Like your caught Up in a Stickup 
Ima go over your head 
like Jordan in a game of Pickup 
And it aint really my fault that I stay Tighter than a Coochie
And it aint really my Fault that I spit rawer than some sushi 
But I think it is my fault
Already Grown I know the Dilly 
Cause I'm street
And I touch more White than the name Billy 
More white than the name Sally
They call cause they want Brittany 
I hit em with more Baggies
I keep em along with me 
If something is wrong with me
Let the devil be my keeper
When we die they put us in a box
Like a pair of sneakers
And I think it's time for you to hang it up
Just like a Celly 
I Done been Down route 46
And hit up all the Telly's 
I Done did my share of dirt
Prolly smoked a ton of weed 
And I never hit the brakes 
Just like the movie Speed 
What is it that these people Need? 
Do they want me to destroy it?
When I walk into a Room
People rise like Unemployment 
I'm a vision to Behold
When I'm rippin up the Stage 
Spreadin myself out for the Bread 
Like a glob of Mayonnaise 
If we was still makin Records 
Then I prolly melt Wax 
I'm similiar to Dope Fiends
That make Mad Tracks 
Listen I am what you Lack
Listen to my Whole Collection 
Throw my stickers on your Car 
like if you Went and Passed Inspection 
Rep your local Emcees
even though they dimes a dozen 
Cause, some of them is sick
Like when you Fuck your Cousin 
First it was and then it wasn't, Yo this is isn't what you think 
I do this involuntarily Like when you Blink 
Ima drop a couple clues
Let me drop a couple hints 
Can't you see I am unique? 
like a set of Fingerprints 
Aint nobody got my style
Aint nobody got my Grunt 
They get Cocky for a while 
then get Sloppy like a Cunt 
I'll be waitin out in front
like if you Went and called a Taxi 
Why you riding shotgun? 
when we treat you like the Backseat 
Absorb this like a Maxi
Ima leave you in the Hudson 
And I do this for my children
So i can Cop them Teddy Ruxpin's 
come up against a Masta! 
its, Rappin is my Expertise 
I think yall got it fucked up
like a Hookers Knees 
Look at them and look at meI
is there really any Competition? 
Calmly I'll defuse the situation like a Bomb Technician 
I'm the Type of person that demands your Respect 
Your skull is empty inside like a Muslim Discotec
I'll suffocate a Python
and poison back a Rattlesnake 
But I got a Softer Side
my little daughter Rattle Shake 
Daddy playin pattycake
I'm lethal as a Ginsu 
You goin have a rough time Like all the shit I been Through 
My tongue is Bleedin cause my words emerge as sharpened Razors
Lines Be
Cyanide that Travels through the vents and Kills the Neighbors 
My pen is vader saber
Chop you up and kill you Later 
Time is ticking like the gut on Peter pan's the Alligator 
I'm the procrastinator
Chopped off my Umbilical 
Because of paranoia that my mom would take my Lyrical 
It's gonna take a miracle for me to get to the top 
All I gotta do is keep it movin
like the hands a clock 
And spit nonstop, and show you what I got inside 
Stay current, stay fresh like bodies with Formaldehyde 
Use the left lobe and right lobe and coordinate my Brain 
While ya'll falling out of Favor and Fame like Corey Haim 
This a game then I just Won it Man 
I grabbed the ball and Ran It Man
I came here to Exterminate it
And take you out like Taliban 
So tell me what's the matter man? 
your off Point like Weathermen 
Everybody got they top 10 like David Letterman 
Ima be up in your top 10
all in your Graces 
And you'll never find me in the same spot, like Different places 
Lets take this back to basics
you Could learn a couple Lessons 
I'm about to buck shots, like if I rolled with Smith and Wesson 
Usher in all your Confessions
feel the Pressure you wont make it 
While I'm layin In a Telly with your baby mama naked 
Had to splack it, I can't take it, disrespect your Way of being 
There's an energy that happens when 2 people are agreeing 
Lets agree to disagree and walk the path Until it splits 
But the path will leave scars on you 
like Silicone Tits 
Bland your Like a Bowl of Grits
man I know I got the Vision 
And I'm livin high definition like a Television 
Take it all or take a smidgeon
and I will go down in History 
I swear to god I'll give my life for this and Claim for victory 
You crackling like hickory
I'm Hotter than a Fireplace 
The first place I smoked a blunt was probably a Firescape 
Beast from the north aint a Chump I go Hard 
And I probably got more Power in my Voice than your God 
Say B.E.A.S.T 
B.E.A.S.T 
B.E.A.S.T
