[Chorus]
Come get your kool on, stars are made to shine {4X}
Stars are made to shine
 
[Greg Porn]
I'm in the double G, three-piece tux
Screamin dressed to kill, hope somebody call my bluff
It's a full house, sippin on a Royal Flush
Two queens is on my cuff, good times is in the cards
Livin on borrowed time I'm payin the extra charge
To feel like something small is worth a hundred large
Swag is on retard, charm is on massage
Wit is on guard, I challenge you to a duel
Who needs a chain when every thought's a jewel?
God bless the weirdo when everyone's a fool
Fuck a genie and three wishes!
I just want a bottle, a place to write my novel
I am like her-oin to those that hear a rhyme and think
"How do you find this upper echelon this time?"
Let's toast to better days 
A beautiful mind and a flow that never age
 
[Chorus]
 
[Black Thought]
Yo, I'm never sleepin like I'm on methamphetamines 
Move like my enemy ten steps ahead of me
Say my reputation precedes me like a pedigree
Gentlemanly gangsta steez, beyond the seventies
Holdin fast money without runnin out of patience
Move in silence, without runnin up in places
Cake by the layers, rich but never famous
Hustle anonymous still remain nameless
In hindsight, gold come in bars like a Klondike
The minute before the storm hit is what I'm calm like
Suited and booted for a shootin like it's prom night
It's suicide, right? Pursuers tried like
to no avail and a heroes what they died like
I got 'em waitin on the news like I'm Cronkite
Not in the limelight, or needed for the crime right
No boasts, just bodied, chalked close to the line tight
 
[Chorus]
 
[Truck North]
Yeah, outside where the killers and the dealers swarm
and inside they dressed up like it's a telethon
Black tie affair but they holdin heavy arms
Straight cash with a stash in the cummerbund
More Bacardi and the bouncers of the party hum
Riots eruptin around and still we party on
Made the quantum leap to a king from a pawn
But it was destined the conclusion was foregone
Serenade of the former slave promenade
'cause them long days in the sun, have now become shade
So we doing high speeds in a narrow lane
Say cheese, free fallin from the aeroplane
Another feather in the cap, for all the years
That we spent in luxuries lap without looking back
'Cause memories could sting like hornet
Damn, it felt good to see people up on it~!
