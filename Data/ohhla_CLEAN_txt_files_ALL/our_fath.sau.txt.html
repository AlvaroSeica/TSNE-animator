I just want to talk about a good father..
Now, coming from me if you where to personally look at my life, you would ask the question
"What do you know, about a good father," and that would be a fair question, because.. one of
the statements that I have written on my notes, here today, is that men need examples
and that's not holy men, all of us, are helped by examples. But it does seem that
as men we feel better, when other men show us that they are man enough to do
whatever it is that we have hesitancy in doing. Whether it is cook, sew maybe sit..
or to shout, clap our hands, cry. We sometimes can't do it until we see other men
who have lost themselves in the praise of God and in life
So, it would certainly be a fair question, on this Father's Day to ask
"What do you know about a good father?" Now when I say father I am speaking of
one who is the guardian or biological male in your life
Who takes you out with them, who teaches you and gives you the instructions to follow
Proverbs talks about the son or daughter following the instructions of the father
well certainly, there is no equivocation about that, that's wonderful, howe'er
in order to follow ones instructions they most know what they're doing
We ask, sociologically, why are there so many, messed up families, what's the problem?
Well, in most of those cases, those children have no or little example to follow
There are exceptions, but in most of those cases, they had little or no example to follow
A good father, is more than one who provides shelter, food, and body coverage
Now I pray that those fathers who are here, and those mothers who had to be fathers
also and everyone once in a while we find some fathers who had to be mothers also:

[Saul Williams]
Our father, which art in, St. Frances Hospital, for hypo-tension
Our father, which art in, jumpsuits and prisons, federal detention
Our father, which art in, dark bars and alleys, lethal injection
Our father, which art in, denial and delusion, this cannot happen again
Hallowed be thy (State your name for the record) (Repeat 6x)
Selves Disraeli end
Dear goddess, we made this break beat just for you
As an offering, can you hear us now (Repeat 2x)
Dear goddess, we made this break beat just for you
As an offering, can you feel us now (Repeat 2x)
When I was young, I cried when I found out I couldn't have children
Soon after, I started rhyming no one was nicer than me
I mean it upstate, New York
I learned to beat box in my tree house
Sounded good up there
Would you rather hear about guns fear
Or broken glass in the tenement
Should I rob to make you fear me now
Dear goddess, can you hear me now 
Clear the way and prepare me now dear goddess, can you hear me now
Dear goddess, we made this break
Beat just for you as an offering, can you hear us now
Dear goddess, we made this
Break beat just for you as an offering, can you heal us now
I'm suppose to be, less of an emcee because I never sold a ki
I sold my homework but,
Y'all niggas were to busy hustling to do
The dome work now you can only rhyme about
How you're stealing chrome work or your cell phone jerk
Change your topic, damn, I'm suppose to be praying
I got to stop it
Dear goddess, we made this break beat just for you
As an offering, can you hear us now
Dear goddess, we made this break beat just for you
As an offering, can you hear us now...
Dear goddess, we made this break beat just for you
As an offering, an offering...</pre>
