[Verse 1]
If you want the money and fame then pay attention
He ain't balling the same you better bench him
All black in the chain you better lynch him
Streets miss him like the range with the 7 engine
Go crazy, I spit fire,
Told baby, my man be fresh, we big timers
Yankee blue Vette with big tires
Can you make any move? Yes got big buyers
Drop Medina, got molly in Aquafina
On my way uptown poppin that la marina
Walking through the crowd like I'm hot and don't got a fever
Eighteen hundred in rucker, we taking shots of tequila

[Bridge]
I don't wanna talk, mami show the real,
I'm a bone crusher, I ain't never scared
Road to the riches I'm already there
IPhone taking pictures I wish niggas was here
Cause it's just

[Chorus]
Bad bitches everywhere, bad bitches everywhere
Bad bitches everywhere, bad bitches everywhere
Bad bitches everywhere, bad bitches everywhere
Bad bitches everywhere, bad bitches everywhere

[Verse 2]
Chinchilla everything, I'm tryina kill everything
Murder with the K stow, quarter mill heavy bling
False thang go, I heard your name never rang
See me in that dang low, bullet 9 the yellow paint
I'm in the cut, Polo down rolling up
I don't frown I don't front,
Keep the pound, load it up, hang around if you want
Bout the brown, mow it up,
Chrissed out, patron it up, got the crowd going nuts
Like throwin up, if you bout that
Bout to turn it up, I keep a judge and a loud pack
Mami wanna fuck, I'm like fuck, where that mouth at
On my main shit, she touch proof, I want my couch back

[Bridge]
I don't wanna talk, mami show the real,
I'm a bone crusher, I ain't never scared
Road to the riches I'm already there
IPhone taking pictures I wish niggas was here
Cause it's just

[Chorus]
Bad bitches everywhere, bad bitches everywhere
Bad bitches everywhere, bad bitches everywhere
Bad bitches everywhere, bad bitches everywhere
Bad bitches everywhere, bad bitches everywhere

[Verse 3]
You can find me in kiss your fly bitch, bad bitches
Or with a vixen up on diteman, bad bitches
Green house, who I'm wifing, bad bitches
Amnesia, let's get it hyking, bad bitches
Bad bitches everywhere, bad bitches everywhere
Find me on the low, tryina bag bitches everywhere
Los going crazy, mad bitches everywhere
And they all know I done have bitches everywhere
That bottles and jays, with the models and jays
She might not never did it, but she gonn swallow today
That new Ferrari is grey, that new Carrera is black
That new Bugatti is beige

[Bridge]
I don't wanna talk, mami show the real,
I'm a bone crusher, I ain't never scared
Road to the riches I'm already there
IPhone taking pictures I wish niggas was here
Cause it's just

[Chorus]
Bad bitches everywhere, bad bitches everywhere
Bad bitches everywhere, bad bitches everywhere
Bad bitches everywhere, bad bitches everywhere
Bad bitches everywhere, bad bitches everywhere</pre>
