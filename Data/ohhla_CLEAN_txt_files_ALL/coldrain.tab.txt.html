[Intro]
Let's try something new - it's been a long time comin
Let's try somethin brand new - aiyyo Ski~!
We overdue man, c'mon
Yo who we do it for?

[Talib Kweli]
This is for the daytrippers and the hipsters, whores and the fashionistas
Spiritual leaders practicin all the laws of attraction
and teachers who readin passages from the Bhagavad Gita
We bustin off Dalai Lamas or flashin heaters; the last of the boosters
with the shootin, the thuggin and all the goonin and spoonin
and all the croonin and coonin and auto-tunin alive
You be tellin to peddle it to consumers I'm helpin them see through it
Get with this new movement, let's move it!

[Chorus]
(Feel the cold rain)
Still standin right here
(Even the winter summer days)

[Talib Kweli]
Yeah I'm a product of Reaganomics
From the blocks where they rockin to feds like Jay Electronica
drop and make this a lock
If you promise us where the heart is whether Jesus or Mohammad
Regardless of where the Mosque is (word)
They hope for the Apocalypse like a self-fulfillin prophecy
Tell me where do we stop it?
Do they ask you your religion before you rent an apartment?
Is the answer burning Qu'rans wo that we can defend Islamics?
The end upon us with a hash tag, a trendin topic
You take away the freedoms that we've been fightin to gain
Then you disrespect the soldiers you ask them to die in vain
In the desert praying for rain
Our music's like a drug and they tend to take it in vein
it ain't for the well-behaved
The soundtrack for when you great but it's more when you felt afraid
More than your average rapper, so you sort of felt the way
The brain is like a cage, you a slave and that's why they lovin you
This is the book that Eli that start with a K-W

[Chorus]
(Feel the cold rain)
Still standin right here
(Even the winter summer days)
Yeah, yeah, I ain't goin nowhere
(Feel the cold rain)
Still standin right here
(Even the winter summer days)
Yeah

[Talib Kweli]
I do it for the trappers other rappers, backpackers the crackers
The niggaz, the metal-packers, the victims of ghetto factories
I do it for the families, citizens of humanity
Emcees endangered species like manatees
I do it for the future of my children! They the hope for the hopeless
Karma approaches, we gon' be food for a flock of vultures
The end of the world; ain't nuttin left but the cockroaches
and the freedom fighters - we freedom writers like Bob Moses
The chosen, freedom writers like Voltaire
For my block, my borough, my hood, my city, my state, yeah
My obligation to my community so clear
Yeah we gotta save them, this opportunity so rare
We do it so big over here that it's no fair
to the punks, bitches, the chumps, the snitches that sneak in the game
We let 'em live although they weak and they lame
They poseurs and jokers promotin when they speakin my name

[Chorus]
(Feel the cold rain)
Still standin right here
(Even the winter summer days)
I ain't goin nowhere
(Feel the cold rain)
Still standin right here
(Even the winter summer days)</pre>
