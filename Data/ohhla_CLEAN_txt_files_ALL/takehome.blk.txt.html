It started with Chick-o-Sticks and candy canes
Illegal joysticks and videogames  you were my ace
A tomboy female with a pretty face
It's so ill, how we relate
You taught me how to ice skate
I know you wonder where I'm going with this rap
With childhood flashbacks, memories we laughed at
Let me explain slow so you know
How it got deeper than the '85 blizzard snow  yo
When you put out the extra sweaters and cocoa
I know you thinking right now that I'm loco
I see you giggling and feeling giddy
But I gotta get it awhile the liquor's in me for real
Stop joking, other seat, take my hand and understand
I got a plan, and you included
Look at me, willing to ?? and take a chance, and
Listen to me; we can do it  yeah

[Block McCloud]
You probably gonna laugh
But mama I've been thinking
How long have we been friends now?
It doesn't make it easy
Lady, you complete me
But it's starting to make sense now
And maybe I've been drinking
Well, you're my other half
And you're my missing rib
And I'm your Mr. Right
And maybe it's the liquor talking
Or maybe it just helped me
To say what I've been felt, see
Growing up in the next apartment
Ever since we was kids
And this'll be the night that 

[Block McCloud]
You can take me home
(Together we can live in paradise)
You can make me whole
(I have no weakness with you by my side)
You can take me home
(Together we can live in paradise)
You can make me whole
(I have no weakness with you by my side)

[Pumpkinhead]
Now you telling me no, see what the whole world does?
Damn  then I'm in trouble
When we're out together, the looks and the whispers
Of a nigga cute couple
Our pride is there, and our glow is strong
Even your moms think something's going on
Even your pops be like What the hell's going on?
I see something worth saving so I'm holding on
And by no means do I intend to disrespect
When I  hold your waist and smell your neck
I gotta hit the men's room, excuse me, I'll be back in a sec
And don't call for the check, I'm not done yet

[Block McCloud]
When we was playing ball and you banged your knee
Who did you run to? You ran to me
When you was hating all of your family
Who did you run to? You ran to me
When you was dating Paul
And you caught him cheating on you with Amery
You ran to me
When you was crying, dying inside
You ran to me so why can't you see that 

[Block McCloud]
You can take me home

[Pumpkinhead]
For me, hit VA alone before we talk off
Then the late plane, a kiss at the airport
When you peeked at me in the shower
At the hotel jumpoff, I felt it then
Don't front, you felt it too
You my friend, what we gon' do
You ran to me, now I'm running to you, cuz 

[Block McCloud]
You can take me home
(Together we can live in paradise)
You can make me whole
(I have no weakness with you by my side)
You can take me home
(Together we can live in paradise)
You can make me whole
(I have no weakness with you by my side)</pre>
