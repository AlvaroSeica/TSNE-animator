[Intro: Solomon Childs (girl)]
(You made do this) Hahaha
Ten to bar... Def Jam remix
Bobby Valentino, Solomon Childs
You know how we do it, Theodore, just another one

[Bobby Valentino]
I saw you walking, down on Melrose
You looked like and angel
Straight out of heaven, girl
I was blown away by, your sexiness
All I have to do is, catch up to you

[Chorus: Bobby Valentino]
Slow down, I just wanna get to know you
But don't turn around 'cause that pretty round thing, looks good to me
Slow down, never seen anything so lovely
Now turn around and bless me with, your beauty, cutie

[Bobby Valentino]
A butterfly tattoo, right above your naval
Your belly button's pierced too, just like I like it girl
Come take a walk with me, you'll be impressed by
The game that I kick to you, it's over and for real

[Hook: Bobby Valentino]
Like a flower fully bloomed in the summertime, you're ready
To be watered by this conversation, you're ready
I'm in awe, cause you shine like the sun
Let me be the one to enjoy you, let's kick it girl

[Chorus 2X]

[Bobby Valentino]
Ooh baby, you know, by now that I want you bad
I'm floating on thin air, I can't come down
Cupid, hit me already damn
Now, I can't leave til seven digits are in my hand, my hand

[Solomon Childs]
Can I have a minute? If you don't talk, listen for a minute
You can hear my heard pounding, like making love on the top of a mountain
Anybody ever tell you, your eyes glisten like a spring time water fall
You the type I gotta open doors for
In your shorts and Jean-Paul Gaultier
Type of girl, I can take anywhere
And, excuse me, if I sound offensive
Most of them sound real effective
But you got the grace, of a jaguar
How it feel, your teeth, when you kiss my neck
The best boost, plus you loving the sex
Suplex, what you say, we text each other?
Maybe call each, maybe hold each other
Listen, use your imagination, put the rest together

[Hook]
