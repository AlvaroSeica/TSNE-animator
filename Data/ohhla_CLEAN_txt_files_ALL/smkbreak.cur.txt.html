Typed by: AZ Lyrics

You should be rolling up by now
Locate your lighters

Prime time
It's mister go left on the bitch who can't find her right mind
I'm squeaking past a yellow light, doin 65
Hope that wasn't one of them camera joints
Traffic eyes in the sky

I'm kind of high
What you done twisted?
I'm used to that killer shit
So I maintain my pimpin
While you over highed and slizzered
And I'm laughin at you slippin
And yo bitch feeling disgusted and miserable
She like why is she even here with you
I'm puttin air in my inner tubes
Black mags on my haro hanging from the wall
The allure of my home decor
Got these girls tripping
And frequently speaking of return visits

A time machine, my lyrics and the same thing for my garage door
You see what I just put in it?
We tryna compete with them NASCARs
You noticing that the styling got switched up
Cause the last one got bit up?
Yeah lil homie y'all can get down, but I bet y'all can't keep up!

This Jet Life ain't for everybody
This shit is reserved for us
Yeah lil homie y'all can get down, but I bet y'all can't keep up!

[Repeat to end]
The stylin got switched up
Cause the last one got bit up
Yeah lil homie y'all can get down, but I bet y'all can't keep up!</pre>
