"Well first of all, let me say this: I need a man who
knows how to make a speech. I think that's very important.
A man who knows a lot of hard words."

	"Well we've checked all the possibilities."

"And we've settled on the one man who we feel can reach the
silent majority and tell it like it is at the same time."

Yo, first of all, you drop (one) beat you see
I be the first MC who grab the mic and spit
You think you the (one) dog? I got one for you
Your crew is in first place, I put some fools in (two)
Now I'm a say this shit (once) when I drop my axe
Wherever you come in, trust me, I'm on top of that
First rapper I ever battled, that fool is in a casket
My first song, that's a hip-hop classic
My first tour was world reknown
I only did MTV (once) but I tore it down
One click got jel (one) time and tried to front
The first fool to talk shit, I slapped him once
?Five Philly and Singleton? cats don't know me
Understand that shit, O-N-E
You're only getting (one) warning if you owe me
If you one of the best then I suggest you show me
You a QB then throw (one), I'm running with mine
I get sweated the first time you hear (one) of my rhymes
Nice with a mic device, I guess it's a curse
If you roll up (two) nigga, guess who's first
(One) slug to your brain, that's equal to (one) verse
There's a shortage in one of the hospital, you get (one) nurse
Y'all niggas is bitches, I've seen (one) of your skirts
It's a lot of bad rappers but I'm (one) of the worst
You one of them weekend thugs acting like you did dirt
Come Sunday morning, you be the first nigga in church
Y'all cats better dispirse, watch it son
He don't got your back, he only own (one) gun
Fuck the forties, niggas better know the nine (one) (one)
That one loud cat is gonna be the reason you all get done
For my sons to gettin' (ones), keep 'em stacking
We gonna go the other way now, peep the subtraction
If you go double platinum you seeing double the stacks
But you ain't deserve all that, I'm a take (one) back
Cop the couple of acts, I'm the reaper, black
Keep ice grilling me and soon, you gonna be rocking the patch
I hear one of your baby mothers, you don't think that's true?
I'm the reason that (one) of your kids don't look like you
I know it's hard to digest, don't start stressing it
It should be hard as shit when you only got (one) intestine
Learn your lesson, you tried to run a couple of blocks
(One) shot, (one) ambulance, and a couple of cops
Now you layed up in surgury with a couple of knots
When you get home, I don't knock, I run up in your spot
First you up in the watch, smack you twice
First one got the cheeks stinging, the second (one) was light
Any MC steals rhymes from Skillz
You gonna be in the yard with (one) of your kids doing (one) handed 
cartwheels
You getting a thousand spins on your B.S. hit
I got 2,000 a day on the Aalyiah remix
For the cats who fronted, ask them again who's nice
I done told y'all niggas once, or maybe it was twice

One two, one two, one two, one two, one two, one two, one...
