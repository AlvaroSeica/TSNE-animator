[P.O.S.]
Dedicated to the brave and the snakes how they stay
steady raising mistakes like the earth won't quake
if they don't break rank, and the bank, and the take, and the hate
And the shape of the grief in the wake of a mistake
Dedicated to the trust in the grave, to the lust and the haze
Every co-dependent with a gust to behave, to the old pet names
The dust and dead pets in the backyard graves
Dedicated to the dedicated few
Under medicated with an elevated view
Stuck down, big ups to the buck-short
The harsh, the snitched, the not-rich, the miscourt
Those who demonstrate when the rest just say
or penetrate when there ain't no way
Dedicated to the sweat in the face
of a man misplaced who finds his own lane

[P.O.S.]
Dedicated to the brave and the snakes how they stay

And the shape of the grief in the wake of a mistake
Dedicated to the trust in the grave, to the lust and the haze
Every co-dependent with a gust to behave, to the old pet names
The dust and dead pets in slippery concaves
Dedicated to the dedicated few
Over-medicated with an underrated view
Stuck down, big ups to the buck-short
The harsh, the snitched, the not-rich, the miscourt
Those who demonstrate when the rest just play
or penetrate like today's that day
Dedicated to the sweat in the face
of a man misplaced who finds his own lane
Dedicated to the real, to the raw
To the ball in the court of a tall sip
Slip through the sidewalk, skip through the hard part
Tip to the card shark, rip through the rampart
Rampage campaign, masquerade that-a way
Dedicated to any fucker that back breaks
Dedicated to any mother with cracks in her pretty face
Dedicated to the rat race
And to the great escape, and to the greatest days
And to the things we make with our own hands
And to the way we stay within the arms delay
until the sting of loss in our own land
And to the great escape, and to the great escape
To the great escape, to the great escape
To the great escape, to the great escape
To the great escape, to the great escape</pre>
