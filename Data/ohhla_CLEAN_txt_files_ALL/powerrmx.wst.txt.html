[Jay-Z - Intro]
Is this thing on?
Oh, I thought they silenced us, 'Ye
Power to the people

We're living in that 31st century, futuristic fly shit
The penthouse is the projects and everybody flies private
New watches (you know what time it is) 
Watch us (you see us)
They can't stop us
The prophets
Beotches!

[Chorus: Kanye West]
No one man should have all that power (Yea!)
The clock's tickin, I just count the hours (Yea!)
Stop trippin, I'm tripin off the power 
("No one man should have all that power!"
