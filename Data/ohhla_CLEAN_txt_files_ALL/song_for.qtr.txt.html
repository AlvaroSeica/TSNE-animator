living in a cage breed hate
6 feet 250 would you miss me still hard to break
what the pain do make your brain do
waiting hating kept seeing thoughts until it came true
in 97 his own father chose to end it
99 his mother became dependent
(a few years later) 2005 at 16
what it like to be human wonder if god listening
he might've known for a few months listened to lennon
and johnny cash a few close friends but they all young
in 96 started putting cameras and guards in the building
I was there the same year felt more like prison
new years new technological advancement
but if the babies feel like criminals it could be more damaging
starve for what they never provide
make me wonder how we ever survive

[Chorus]
my heroes not yours you probably arrested them
your schools probably neglected them
they spawn thoughts you probably infected them
feed us what you feed us you can lay us next to them
fbi call it major crimes
babies making babies cry
everywhere my people walk stakes are high
I wonder what you say to god

[Brandon Allday]
walls leaking blood like whine
took a 28 year old father from his daughter's side
they heard gunshots before teachers started barricading the doors
glass shattered cut sharpened the floor
looking like the walls leaking 45 shots bleeding
he was quiet bet them hear him now
but they heard a round - speaking with bullets
make life not long as it seem amplify the sound of death
what type of feelings he hold make him want to kill his own
now they sending babies in the helicopter lift
coughing up blood prayers saved the seven that lived
doctor couldn't really relate to a night like this
said nowadays everybody slicing their wrists
he don't know how that feel but the prozac bottle filled
starve for what they never provide
make me wonder how we ever survive

[Chorus]
my heroes not yours you probably arrested them
your schools probably neglected them
they spawn thoughts you probably infected them
feed us what you feed us you can lay us next to them
fbi call it major crimes
babies making babies cry
everywhere my people walk stakes are high
I wonder what you say to god

[Brandon Allday]
I saw babies your age where most spend their days
orange handguns in the arcade stood out more than usual
school let out for awhile flags at half staff
and press conferences and north country regional
walmart donated 5 thousand for the wake
so thats what they made a couple hours that day
probably paid for with all that broadcast blank video tape
fbi came and went tell me what changed
same day legislators came to visit you
they cut the funds for a new middle school
I don't want to know who you blame bloodshed blood
all the same and I don't accept death in vain
hotels and restaurants read our thoughts are with you
I wish it was all so simple
starve for what they never provide
make me wonder how we ever survive

[Chorus]
my heroes not yours you probably arrested them
your schools probably neglected them
they spawn thoughts you probably infected them
feed us what you feed us you can lay us next to them
fbi call it major crimes
babies making babies cry
everywhere my people walk stakes are high
I wonder what you say to god</pre>
