[Sean Price]
Yeah; yo - uhh, gotta be P hatin
The fist to your face claim Muhammad Ali shakin
Fist full of chips grated, gotta be P cakin
Whimp you with Jim fakin, gotta be P apin
I sell white rock and clap canons
I'm old school like white rock soda and backgammon
Rap phantom, Sean is a starvin artist
I gained a lot of weight cause a nigga eatin regardless
You a target, and talk about bullseye (bullseye)
You a Target employee, a good guy (a good guy)
And ain't nuttin wrong with that, nigga
and ain't nuttin wrong with this
I make somethin strong with rap nigga and guess what?
The nigga next up, he can't make a song for shit
P! Mad smart, no Cornel West shit
But I can make death ring your doorbell next kid
I told y'all I'm with the family chill
Don't sleep a phone call'll get your family killed

[Hook: Torae]
Gotta be Sean, gotta be who bodied the song
Cause Brownsville ill, gotta be on
Ruckus you wrong, gotta be - the fuck is you on?
Popping pills, chopping krills - what the fuck is you doin?
Gotta be the best rapper to spit it, clap in a minute
Gotta let these niggas know who still actually live it (P)

[Sean Price]
It gotta be P snappin
The fifth to your face, shake, I gotta be relapsin
Spit in your face, maybe gotta be P laughin
Gift from the eight? Great, it gotta be P clappin
I can't stand around you bitch niggaz
Inf' beam make your team steam like a fish dinner
.... But the new shit burgindy
with new kicks straight from Munich, Germany
My net worth be makin your neck jerk
Expert whenever, whenever the sket burst
Bang bang, the most fabulous flow
Yo, your whole shit dead, toe tag on the floor
Villainous speech, rappers play pretend with the beats
Hit with the knife, goodnight, then I send 'em to sleep
(Good night nigga!) Nigga, General P
And the +KITT+ is like the confederate General Lee, P!

[Chorus]</pre>
