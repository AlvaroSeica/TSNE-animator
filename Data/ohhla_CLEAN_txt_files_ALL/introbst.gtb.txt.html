[Intro: DJ Ready Red]
Today's special, is Geto Dope process, in 5th Ward, Texas
We sell so much of this, Brad man
Geto Boys, Geto Boys
Geto Boys, Geto Boys
(*Multiple Gun Shots*)

[Scarface]
Y'all, give it up to the invincible
This H-Town finest, The GB the generals
The street shit, the timers, the motherfucking criminals

[Chorus: Female Singer]
Gangster, awww, put me down
Gangster, awww, put me down

[Bushwick Bill]
Rap-A-Lot, streets music 
Geto Boys stay alive
It's time to kick some more of that shit, YEAAHH!!

[Willie D]
I make big money, I drive big cars
Everybody knows me, it's like a movie star, fool

[Scarface]
Pulled out my .38 and aimed at the bitch
A cop says (FREEZE, motherfucker!) Bitch, suck my dick
I said "Die, motherfuckers!" as I blasted
(*Sample of the Police Sirens*) 
Something clicked in my head, visions of bodies in plastic

[Bushwick Bill]
Yeah, Geto Boys in this bitch still banging
And ain't shit changing, uhha.. ain't shit changing
(*Multiple Gun Shots*)

[Outro: DJ Ready Red]
Geto Boys, Geto Boys
Yeah, Geto Boys, Geto Boys
DON'T FUCK WITH ME!! -----&gt; Tony Montana
COME ON!!
Geto Boys, Geto Boys
Geto Boys, Geto Boys</pre>
