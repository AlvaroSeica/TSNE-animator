[Intro: Dezi Page]
Hey! Hey! Heyyyyyyyy!!!!

[Chorus: Dezi Page]
I always knew I touch the sky
With heart full of fire and third eye
Steady my vision my climb
I, I knew, with all my mind

[Verse One: Common]
The dream manifesto to get it and don't let go
Praises to the most high eyes are kinda set low
A man of many faces I rock the crooked smile
Since they took off my braces
Back on Stoney Isle we was on our own oasis
Mild sauce, hot tempers cold cases
Huh! I ran the town not knowin it was racist
Standin on the deck and smokin aces
Grace is the wonderland, I see the face of the sunnah man
A fatherless child that made it to the motherland
I think how far these raps really took me
A veteran in the game I stay fresh like a rookie
When I was underground, they use to overlook me
Now flicks and book tours make it hard for them to book me
The presence of Rah, the essence of a star
Jewelry and a car, suggestin who we are
The blessings of Jah, that come through us all
I'm seasoned y'all I never knew when to fall
In the quicksand

[Chorus: Dezi Page]
I always knew I touch the sky
With heart full of fire and third eye
Steady my vision my climb
I, I knew, with all my mind

[Verse Two: Frank Nitt]
The picture's been clear since the man's been a shorty
Consoldate the dollars go dumb E-40
No pimpin in your jewelry no sleepin with your jewelry off
And when you get your chance slam dunk it Ron Turiaf
And I did that, me and my guys reppin the city
And I hustle with no pity they christen me Frank Nitty
And I took that and I ran with itmade a few stacks and some bands with it
But then I brought it home a student must then teach his own
And I could never dream it could go from the Yancey's basement
To be standin up on stages in front of some foreign faces
Get love in those foreign places like we from there, and oh yeah
They like, where the dollars at? I'm like, I'm a call ya back
And please let me clarify, playa I'll be damn if I
Ever let the picture fade to black before I say goodbye
Spot you like you spotify, Nitty make the song cry
I'm a let Illa sing this lullaby, quicksand

[Chorus: Dezi Page]
I always knew I touch the sky
With heart full of fire and third eye
Steady my vision my climb
I, I knew, with all my mind

[Verse Three: Illa J]
I heard a hater say I never be more than J. Dilla's little brother
I never be more than an insignificent other
I never be more than a video stand in
But here I am standin
When you hater try to leave me in the quicksand
Left me outside of the club with no wristband
Now I'm pissed off like I'm reppin the Pistons
'Til I came all the way from fuckin Michigan
That's when the shit hit the fan then I moved back
Had to do my Stella still I had to get my groove back
Then I came up with a plan to put my shoes back
On I ran hella hella fast until I proved that
I could do it while I'm swimmin in the pool of sweat, blood and tears
My career I had to keep pursuin that
And I could do that, with my eyes closed
'Cause I know I'm fly, always knew I!!!!

[Chorus: Dezi Page]
I always knew I touch the sky
With heart full of fire and third eye
Steady my vision my climb
I, I knew, with all my mind

[Outro: Dezi Page]
With my mind! With my mind! 
With my mind! With my mind! (In all my mind!)
With my mind! With my mind! 
With my mind! With my mind!
