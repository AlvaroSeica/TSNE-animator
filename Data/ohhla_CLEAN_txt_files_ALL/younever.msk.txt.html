Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
See I used to be the type of mija that used to get fuked up over love
with tequila in ma cup and I went off mad at the world and everybody in it
down a couple shots with the homies til I finish bottles up
plus I thought about all those times you used to hold me
cryin all nite long over some stupid shit u told me
Talkin on the phone with ma best homegirl
askin if she saw u with some otha girl
and still it all remained the same you were a perro
but I guess I didn't kno that back den ya ke me acuerdo
it didn't matter I was the envy of tha hood ma homitaz
let me kno dat chu was up to no good
but I smiled cause I thought nah this can't be true
when in fact deep down ya I always knew
and wat was I suppose to do
one day u treated me like shit and you would try to act all crazy

[Chorus]
It never mattered wat tha fuk I meant to you
It never mattered all tha shit that we went thru
So go ahead and do your thing all you want
now cause I don't give a fuk u ain't got me waitin up
It never mattered all those things that u told me
It never mattered all those times you used to hold me
So go ahead and talk your shit all you want now
I'm sayin Fuk Love So Puto Shut The Fuk Up!

[Verse 2]
Go ahead and talk about your babosadas I'm used to u sleep
talkn smack behind mi cara that I'm a big time freak
shit is that suppose to hurt me thanks to you
I got a gang a vatos tryna get to kno me
but let me break this down pa ke entiendas
wat I'm sayin you tryna play the victim
that's a jueqo I ain't playin you stupid mutha fucker
I'm just makin sure your hurting putting me on blast
yes u thought dat that woulda hurt me but helll nah
I don't play dirty like that if you want to
tellin all your homies how the many times I fuked you
I guess you se te olvido decir les alqo you never made me
cum ni si kiera de milaqro
but chales I know you could'nt let them know
that u say dat you can handle it rite but u don't own that mijo
keep lien to urself about wat happened this used to be
between us but rite now you got me laughin

[Chorus]
It never mattered wat tha fukq I meant to you
It never mattered all tha shit that we went thru
So qo ahead and do your thinq all you want now cause I don't qiva a fuk
U ain't qot me waitin up
It never mattered all those thinqs that u toldd me
It never mattered all those times you used to hold me
So qoo ahead and talk your shit all you want now
I'm sayin Fukq Lovee So Puto Shut The Fukq Up!

[Verse 3]
I guess you probably thought I woulda kept cryin
I guess you probably thought I woulda kept tryin
to get a hold of you so I can get chu back
but I'm too buzy with ma people tryna make that stack
and count that feria stroll around like it ain't nada
so I'm not gona waist ma vida with a chavala
y mi lana viene on top of it and from tha word of the street
got chu wishin I fall isnt it funny how u tryna ser me dano
pay backs a bitch now eres tu el acavado
el awitado that's really funny to me cuando
presumes de una ruca ke no se compara a mi
she a hoodrat y se lo diqo en su cara ain't nada to be
jealous about pobre chavala actions speak louder den words
so best you learn it u kan have your shit back estupido already burned it

[Chorus]
It never mattered wat tha fuk I meant to you
It never mattered all tha shit that we went thru
So go ahead and do your thing all you want now
cause I don't give a fuk u ain't got me waitin up
It never mattered all those things that u told me
It never mattered all those times you used to hold me
So go ahead and talk your shit all you want now
I'm sayin Fuk Love So Puto Shut The Fuk Up!</pre>
