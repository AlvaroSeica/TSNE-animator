Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
I said I'm headed to the liquor store
40 ounce, 6 blunts &amp; a bag of dro
(dro, dro, dro)
All these bitches I'm fuckin'
All this money we flippin'
All this weed that I'm smokin'
Man this shit got me trippin'
I said I'm headed to the liquor store
40 ounce, 6 blunts &amp; a bag of dro
(dro, dro)
All these bitches I'm fuckin'
All this money we flippin'
All this weed that I'm smokin'
Man this shit got me trippin'

[Verse 1]
I'm that new guy your girl's talking bout
L.a. it's going down
Fuck you haters
We made it
Yeah they wish we traded places
Just a one day operation
That bullshit is amazing
Got no replacement
Just write notes &amp; face it
Smoking this weed
Your bitches fucking with me
I got a click full of riders
Who got no problem with beef
Hold it down &amp; cock it
Got weed &amp; pills in my pocket
Too many hoes at my crib
My neighbors want me to stop it
They calling complaining
Talkin' bout the cops on their way
You know I'm used to all that bitch
I live in l.a
Yeah we deal with that
We real with that
Check the news we pealing caps
Young king enemy
Always dropping the realist rap

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Mr2theP]
I'm posted with my feet up
While I'm smoking weed
Chiefin' with the team
Who helped me live the dream
I roll up &amp; I smoke
I run out &amp; get mo'
That's mo' weed
And that's mo' drank
Mo' drugs sure thing
Poo tang - wu-tang
Thirty-six
Back to see what dirty is
Sucio with a groupie ho
I'm a murder this
Oh duh I go dumb
Oh um where you from?
Big line &amp; I go numb
H-b is where I'm from
Who let this muthafucking guero out the casa
You didn't know?
Lil g was para la raza
Feeling car sick
While I'm in the whip
(oh we doing just fine take another hit)
I pop the top &amp; I choke
While I'm filling my lungs
Bump &amp; grind with a banging 9
Beach life &amp; what's up?
I'm posting with my chick
While she roll my weed
And then I send her to the liquor store
To get a drink

[Chorus]</pre>
