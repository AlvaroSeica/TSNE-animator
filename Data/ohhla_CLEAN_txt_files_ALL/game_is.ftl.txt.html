[Chorus]
My game is tight my money is long
My cars is new my muscle is strong
???
5 o'clock in the morning we open again
My game is tight my money is long
My cars is new my muscle is strong
???
5 o'clock in the morning we open again

[Verse 1]
I do wat I won't in the hood
They seem to just loves us
Fuck the law middle finger to cops in public
I rippin the streets but I rather be rippin the stage
Iam from the zoo my gorillas don't fit in no cage
We go bananas for the hood and go ape for the baby
And iam married all the time no mistake it for lady
If everything is all for ??iam takin the 80
And all these misdemeanor 2's is makin me crazy
I get it for this and sell it for that
I walk wit the fifth, I ride wit the mac
?????
5 o'clock in the morning we open again
Its never bout nothing unless its involving some paper
And if I can't sell u nothing ill talk 2 u later
Do wat I gotta do the cops can't stop me iam ??
I dirty the 40 and dropped then caught me the ??

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
G-Unit is the pussy
So through ur hustle
Go ahead and act like u won't it
Watch me run through ur muscle
I know iam bout it bout it
I love to stash money
U c that bitch right there she keeps it in her ass for me
Iam always on point
At night I might sleep wit the hammer
The mail man I drop it off and I creep wit the scanner
Iam untouchable but shit I ain't Al Capone
We twist up sour and that coush leave the malls alone
The coppers behind me but fuck it I speed wit no license
The copper hold 90 so blood ain't no need 4 fightin
???
5 o'clock in the morning we open again
Get caught cutting shorts we gon open ur skin
I had a 44 long noise pokin in ur chin
My game is tight my money is long
I get money from the hood and get money from songs

[Chorus](x4)</pre>
