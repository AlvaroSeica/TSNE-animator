[Chorus: repeat 2X]
I solemnly swear that I will stay raw (raw)
So if you love hip-hop I'm the savior that you prayed for (for)
I ain't here to bring it back, I'm livin proof
that'll show you how a liar and a thief can be the truth (truth)

[Diabolic]
Yo...
I'll burn a ounce of the best, left with doubts left in my stress
Speakin from the heart like there's a second mouth on my chest
I really must confess I've been thinkin who I might murder
And stoppin me is like Ike Turner bein a civil rights worker
I'm Dr. Jekyll and the twisted side of Mr. Hyde
I swim beside the sharks but got bigger fish to fry
Don't matter if I live or die, I'm here and I'ma fight you
and the only place that I'm gettin punched in is the mic booth
Aight Duke? You know the stuff I'm droppin is hot
Shit is fire like the Human Torch coppin a squat
It's the only option I got, so I'ma rape the industry
Makin history and ain't nobody sayin shit to me
Defeat is agony, I'm thrilled by the taste of victory
Out in the Boondocks boombox playin "Symphony"
I still exist in rap even when I'm sittin back
The only livin cat with a fan base off a hidden track

[Chorus]

[Diabolic]
You know it's not hype, I've been God-like when I rocked mics
since gunmen took 'Pac's life in Vegas at a stop light
Way before Suge Knight had cops aimin fours
Off duty shootin B.I.G. leavin the Soul Train Awards
And later on I came across my own fatal flaws
When I shit where I eat and wipe my ass with the table cloth
I sprayed the boss and I'ma take his turf for paper work
I'm an angel's birth intertwined with an ancient curse
And to make it worse, these kids buy the records we drop
An excessively hot recipe, I'll never be stopped
You could have my mind shackled and penitentiaries locked
I'll eventually pop the sheriff with the deputy's Glock
My shock value's 10 times the cost of pure lightning
I just lose it off the top like Lucy Liu sword fightin
When it comes to raw writin, 'Bolic's a born titan
To be completely honest I wish there were more like him

[Chorus]

[Diabolic]
Yo...
I came to a fork in the road, hopped it straight and swerved
Stole an ancient language and escaped, I got a way with words
I give the kids who love hip-hop what they deserve
and a little somethin me, myself, and I can break in thirds
Could say a verse you wish you thought of but didn't think
while I sit and drink and spit some pink vomit in my kitchen sink
Merciless as Meng, clenched fist, kiss the ring
The vicious king, livin off beer and chicken wings
I mountain climbed to get here, like next year is our time
Now it's mine, a chance to show these peasants how to rhyme
Survival of the fittest, 'Bolic's so prepared
King of the jungle, throwin solar flares at a polar bear
Lion's pride, eye of the tiger, coldest stare
and some drunk thoughts on my front porch in a folding chair
Drinkin vodka, tryin to do my thing and prosper
'til the fat lady singin opera while I finger pop her
It's over bring the doctor, referee stop the fight
'Bolic's nice at the bar, throwin chairs like Bobby Knight
I body mics, but they won't play my cleanest version
cause I ain't a people person and rotation's pre-determined
To be for certain, I'll get even with these evil serpents
when they girl's penis slurpin, gaggin like bulimics purgin
I'm a genius workin, leavin pussies bleedin worse than
a screamin virgin with a deep insertion between her curtains

[Chorus]</pre>
