[Verse 1]
I snuck inside the ground floor
Duck and hide around walls		
Invisibility, hid
In facility, swift with agility		
Forced entry, assault sentry
I cross fence and crawl vents then stalk and siege		
Gruesome, relentless, vicious, bury ya
Move undetected in restricted area		
Lost your life cause you aggravated Lone
Walk the night through evacuated zones		
The sword the spear, the bow and arrow
The lord appears for forceful battle 		
More Clientele for hired gun
Wore riot shield in violent slums		
Unmerciful with the surgical strike
I'll murder you, the insurgent will fight	

[Chorus]
"Slide from your field 
Of vision, I lie 
Still, hide 
In concealed position			
The assassin's assignment's
Met, it's matter
Of life and death
Blast from the sniper's nest"

[Verse 2]
General, boss, special force operative
Sentinels tossed,level fort, charging in		
Best in the sport, yes of course got the win
Sever your corpse, dreadful loss chopped your limbs	
Wreck you false charlatans and rivals
They breathless, lost oxygen, and died slow				
They exit, recite a hymn in bible
The menace will fight for grim survival			
Perilous trooper, it's harsh war
Rebel intruder, when dark falls				
Make rounds and start brawl, sword cut flesh
Take down your top score, cause upset				
Raw slugfest, assassin is solo
Combat in the dojo? That is a no no				
It's on when the violence met wrath
Perform the Defiant Trepass			

[Chorus]
"Slide from your field 
Of vision, I lie 
Still, hide 
In concealed position			
The assassin's assignment's
Met, it's matter
Of life and death
Blast from the sniper's nest"
