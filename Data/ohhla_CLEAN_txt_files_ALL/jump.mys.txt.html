(Mystikal's human door opening)
Poof, oh no not you, fuckin right bitch
Uhh, what uhh poof fuck, jump round jump
C'mon jump, jump, jump round, jump jump
I ain't got no more answers left, bitch i rap it all
You just ain't gonna have no more head after I snatch it off
What in the fuck is you thinkin?
You can't do shit if you stankin!!!
Keep on thankin if I say it then it's done
I give a fuck what you bringin
Because my ????? elbows be swingin
You here those fuckin choppers cuttin niggas, run nigga!!!
Hike nigga, hut what
Nigga want some?!
Ain't nothin for ya represent where i come from
Front son, brown blood, I'll lay all of you down son!!!
Recognize a fuckin killa when you be around 'em
Values and ?????
Sterroids and alcohol still a fuckin athlete
Cock strong with my jock strap on with the time clock 
Bout to run the rock home
Yo ace brew crew and a hole in the clutch and a pocket on the field
And the down gets touhed!!!!

Chorus 2x: Uh oh here I come, here I go,uh oh, jump round jump!!!
                   Watcha wanna do?!
                   Watcha gonna do?!
                   Let me know girl, jump, jump!!!

You can tell by the style of losin
I got all of my adveseries cruisin for a brusin with contusions
Cuts, atserations, broken bones, and open soars
Ripped spleans, sprained ankles, and broken noses
I bust the microphones i flip on!!!
I step on the stage and get my grip on
That's when you get you get the skip on!!
It's on and I'm the shit homes!!!!
I fucked around and lost count of bitches I put the dick on
My ?????
And I'm cool when I talk to P
They fuckin call me the home-town hero
Im the center of attention
The topic of the discussion
It's understood they already know with out me sayin nothin
It's been like that since these niggas been down here wearin badges
I'm off the heasy!!!!!
I'm the reason for this pimp rap!!!
So I stumble over myself sometimes like I ain't got no mind
I said fuck it dawg I'm over the crowd like the goal-line!!!!!!!!

Chorus

Nigga you just like ten yards 
Always the fisrt down
Be the first muthafucka off the bus and the last nigga to clown
Ol' sometime ass nigga ol' fake regular regular everyday common ass 
No drama ass nigga
I keep these niggas sippin' on super dick and advil
Punch 'em in their muthafuckin ass and keepin it that real
Ain't nothin you can do to keep a nigga off the score board
It's fourth and four 
FUCKIN RIGHT IM GONE!!!!

Chorus:4x

Jump, round, jump
Jump, Jump
Jump, round, jump watcha wanna do watcha gonna do
JUMP,JUMP!!!</pre>
