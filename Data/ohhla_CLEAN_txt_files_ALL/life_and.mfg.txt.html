Song:   Life and Death
Typed by: kstarr1@hotmail.com

Her name is Life, loyal, would never do me wrong
With the best move she was a beautiful song
A schoolgirl, mastered biology
Taught me everything, she holla hollla at me
Beyond vision, totally internal
Trees, bees, birds, words, verbs, nouns
Took walks in the park
She was sweet but at time hard knock

Til I met Death, she took the last breath of me
I met her through her cousin Sleep
To the left, to the right, she went both ways
Yes chasing her was chasing Amy
Took me to the edge, told me jump with her
I was hypnotized so I jumped with her
Cause I wanted her, confronted her, between the sheets
I messed with her Life paging me want me to mess with her
Don't feel like being stressed with her
She wants to walk in the park, I wanna run the streets
I'm acting real cold, she's giving off heat

She rather see me get a diploma
I go check out my homegirl Coma
Coma and I have a cool relationship
She give keys to the crib and don't ask me for shit
Sack the fridge for me to drink and eat up
I'm skeeming like a demon on the couch with my feet up
Pay-for-view championship bout
Main event didn't start so I slipped right out

And called Life from the pay phone she's chewing me out
She sensed that I'm cheating the way I'm moving about
A nigga from the streets is what you trying to be
Your sleeping around, stop lyin' to me
Life, you know you act like a bitch right?
Then we just die, that's why I get high
And she said my love you try to deny, but please give me a try

But Death's a fiend, public places having sex with me
The streets are watching us, stay hard when she's next to me
We don't love these hoes before we lust
She introduced to her girlfriend and off I bust
Menage-a-trois we must constantly
Together fuck the world criminology is what she taught to me
Feels so nice giving blow jobs in her mouth is glaciers of ice

I act up cause I'm backed up with virginous Life
Won't give it up until I make her my wife
Life want it all, I just can't win
Traveled back to Coma house and then I slipped back in

Coma love me ladies sexy as can be
She looks into my eyes and asks what's troubling me
Powers beyond are humbling me
Gotta pick one so which one will it be
Women like Death is all around the world
She said Life is wonderful a hell of a girl
She wants to share her world give you all she can
Death's a freak slept with every damned man
Life got your back she's picking you up
Death packs the gat straight sticking you up
Life can't live without you she's biggin' you up
But put Life after Death cops are diggin' you up
Life is precious she's one of a kind
Choosing Death over Life you lost your mind
Life is the one for you no doubt
Main event was over so I broke the hell out

And called life back how silly I've been
I took her for granted when she's my best friend
Nothing lasts forever one day it will end
But I remain loyal until then
Mentally strong she would carry me
Got down on my knee Life marry me
I feel so blessed because she said yes
Now I gotta break it off with Death

Tell her the right way don't provoke her
Cause how she livin' mi vida loca
I spoke to her, but she didn't listen
Straight face like poker
A joke to her
She think I'm bluffin'
But I'm not, things gettin' hot
As I leave her spot
She pulls a gun out
And says it's not over

Fatal attraction actions alter my mind state
Meet your fate cause up goes the death rate</pre>
