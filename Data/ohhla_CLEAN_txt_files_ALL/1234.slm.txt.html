Yup ( Box and Royal)
Done hook up with Slim &amp; Danja
You know it's about to get dangerous

Chorus: repeat 2x 

1st off is ya majesty 
Royal a pimping pro
2nd in line we got a box, juggy ,and greedy
And we stacking dope
I'm running 3rd up of my word
Danja off to let you know
Look here, Slim chance yo last chance
I'm coming 4 by 4

Verse 1: Box

1st off ( girl who is that) I'm ya majesty
The 1st nigga on the block
That be causing tragic
I'm the first nigga to answer when my niggaz call
(oh Thug ass nigga) girl voice
I'm the 1st nigga to show these fucking hoes I'm a dog
I'm the 1st nigga to cock
The 1st nigga to shoot
The 1st nigga to smoke something
But the last nigga to do
I hit hoes on the 1st night
Been pimping since my 1st night
Marijuana was my 1st flight
Been thugging since my 1st fight
A tisket ,A tasket, A nigga in a casket
4 run up typical, Cause I ain't trying to get my ass kick
1 nigga down , Now I got 1 more to go
Fall thought I had the clips but see i had 1 bullet more
That's just 1 scenario
I'm bout my paper ,bout my chetter
Just  made a hundred G's but 1 million would be better
Now it's my pleasure
I always be the first nigga to flow
Don't mean to cut it short, but they got 3 more verses to go

Chorus: repeat 2x 

Verse 2 : (Royal)
Oh yeah I'm from the boot
And look I'm too cold
I'm that same lil nigga that got that benz with 2 doors
Whip a nigga for benting 2 bows
Playing hard gone get ya  broke
And get ya body filled 2 holes
Everyday go shopping for new clothes
And my old lady mad at me
Cause she caught me cheating with 2 hoes
Boy, I'm getting paid 2 do shows
And I know some niggaz like my grill
Started out with 2 golds
Me and these niggaz got true golds
And on the mic, I guess you can consider us, As a few pros
Will I make a Mill (million)
Well, who knows
Look 5 figures good ,But dog I'm trying to add 2 more
Back up out my face, You too close
And Stop fronting like you got money
Know damn well you too broke
Let me grab my glock and unload
Cause you might tripped when I tell you that I had ya girl unclothes
Now watch all this drama unfold
And I'll bet my own life that I'll take ya out with 1 blow
Number one title that the South holds
And if you niggaz talking shit you keep ya motherfucking mouth closed

Chorus: repeat 2x

Verse 3: (Danja)
I say 3,2,1 or 1,2,3
You motherfuckas really wanna know 
What the hell is bothering me
I got 3 bomb bitches looking me dead in my face
And I got 3 bomb bitches down to have what it takes
Got them 3 motherfuckas looking like they ready 4 war
And them same 3 niggaz 
Got 3 minutes to back up off me Boy
I got 3 plus 6 up in my pants ready to dance
And I got 3 beer on the table line
And I ain't scared to take no chance
I got 3 pounds on dink and 3 bags of ices
got 3 buds to smokeÂ…looking like 3 blind mice
I got 3 rounds of PART-TAE
Comes 3 the hard way
You wanna run up on me
Plus 3 you gon have a hard day
Now you claim to be a soulja
Ain't no game to be I told ya
Bitch! Hold up, It's over
Trying to play with a 3 leaf clover
I got 3 mo golds and 3 mo hoes 
And I know they got  three's copying
So ya'll hoes got to go

Chorus: repeat 2x

Verse 4: (Slim)

I got 44 hoes and 4 golds, 44 shows and 4 blows

Put the 4 seats roll in the tank
44,000 in 4 banks, Got 4 accounts and 44 safes

Got a mansion with 4 floors

Breaking 'em down and chopping 'em down

Call for hearses to get their ass
Call the market and order 4 caskets
