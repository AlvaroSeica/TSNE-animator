Chorus:
Esta Loca darle juevo
dame chocha, you dont get dinero
si te gusta, dirle huerpa
rub my pepe, I rub your teta

(Madd Rapper)
Yo Yo Yo  hey pretty momma, you look sweet
I mean you the mamacita Ive been dying to meet
beautiful in a day in July and May
last summer at the puerto rican day parade
I said "mida chica, que te pica?"
tu me ore, toda vida
I kick it to her like a real thug should
bacardi limon, hydro in a black wood
my name is dot, you hot boo, how you do
like ricky ricardo, I hit them with the bobbaloo
"yo yo man Im on your deric boo for real"
combination of Salma Hayek and Jennifer Lopez
aint nothing like a spanish chic my friends say
that loves head, salsa, merengue
mi favora con esta chocha
like Ricky Martin, livin la vida loca

Chorus:

(Beatnuts)
I love a morena, or latina, 
even a china or blanquita 
or get pounded by the heavy gringa
no need to turn this into Jerry Springer
start a big fight over Big Syke
we can all pitt fight and get drunk tonight
baby you want to hold hands and slow dance
candle light romance no chance
I need a muchacha mala even badder than don
dominicana, colombiana, let me do the honors mami
you know exactly lo que quiero
I knew from the getgo, that the honey was ghetto
but she started screaming 
"Beatnuts Im a brooklyn model"  
She's a mac, well dot I know her from corona
you can bone her, just show her some bread 
she's a paloma, cccccooooo, ccccccooooo   

Chorus (Repeats until skit)</pre>
