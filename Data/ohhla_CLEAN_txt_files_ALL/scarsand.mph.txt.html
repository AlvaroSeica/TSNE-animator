[Verse 1 - Muph]
Implants of paint sitting near her armpit
Arabic scripture, persist and I harness
The stained artist that plays the smartest role
Red wine stains on the carpet I hold
The chart is in goals of all the spilt stains and etched scars
Guilt remains and you're left charred
By the memoires of pain while they gain from the marks
And the blame came with a rushed gush
What the fuck's up? Man I'm stuck, every morning I wake up
I stay cut with enough scars to develop an entourage
That makes the skin hard, makes the skin hard - talking really thick skin!
The stains are - washed away with a rinse
They're out of sight, out of mind, haven't thought about 'em since
But the scars stay visible, and each individual
Looks back with a miserable little pinch
Cautious, before it repeats itself
The stains fade, the scars stay, time does tell
And time keeps talking to me, keeps on just walking with me

[Hook - X2]
This ain't a game, it's hard
So fuck having fame and cars
The shit I deal with leaves me stained and scarred
We write dangerous bars
Put the truth in 'em to make 'em last
And get us past all the stains and scars

[Verse 2 - Minas]
I write raps like its therapy
Until the situations that I'm facing don't even get to me
Eventually proving I'm much stronger than that
Getting past feeling I've got to react
Calm though, if not for the tracks and beats
I'd have to speak and probably end up smacked and beat
I little in real and that's just me
I've been scarred in fights half my life
Remember being scared to walk the streets of Oak Park after the dark of night
From certain groupies, there's truth these
Physical pain washed like stains, it's nothing new to me
What it left me scarred with, the lessons I learnt
When I grew up of course back then - never concerned
But now I'm picking up on new stuff, I ain't too tough
And cuts fade like I'm hoping all this drug use does
True Muph? {Yeah the man's right} I might still stand and fight
But I'd rather put my hands on the damn mic

[Hook - X2]

[Verse 3 - Muph]
Now lets take a step back in time
When I was walking along a thin line
Blind to the signs that stood before me
Dragged from behind, I was about to get cut shortly
Shot down in a blazing story
Awkwardly they cornered me, normally, I'd approach formally
Walking all over this over range rover
Stained clover yelling move slower!
The lower they went, the deeper the wound
Too much blood for the bandaid to consume
Ripped me off, pissed me off as they blossom and bloom
Hooned from the evidence, stole my ideas and sentiments
Meddling with the lettering, you'll never again
Get the better my friend, but then again I've been sliced right before
Scabs and sores, then I'll dab some more
Ripped more, skin torn red raw
Seemed strange, but to settle the score
I arranged to get Nappysan, kill those germs
And make me a happy man with battle plan
Of stand and watch karma crack through your armour
Snake charmer, intensity
And we all get stained and scarred eventually
{But the scars are what messes with you mentally}
I won't let these imperfections get the best of me
That's a recipe for laughter, I'ma kill the stains
And worry about the injuries obtained after</pre>
