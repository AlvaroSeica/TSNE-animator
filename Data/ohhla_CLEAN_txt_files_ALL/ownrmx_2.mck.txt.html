[Verse One: Joell Ortiz]
I'm tryin to pick up a stranger with her draws off
Tonight I'm doin the wrangler with the doors off
I got some keys to the Waldorf Astoria 
My story get glorious down on all fours
That smile too pretty, why I talk for?
Stay right here with me, why walk for?
Baby your back is wild as that boy Mack
When that waitress come back whatever you wanna pour is yours
I'm thorough my borough gotta love and respect it
Anything less these goons with me would not accept it
Baby you rockin with a G
I put them G's on your feet what's a G?
Gees! I ain't trickin I'm just havin fun
I know tricks though let's disappear under the sun
Uh! Pick a coast pick a beach
But tonight pick your cup up let's toast to us ownin the street

[Chorus: Mack Wilds]
Tell me where you wanna go, what you wanna do

[Verse Two: Mack Wilds]

Said I don't mean to brag, but I live a life that most can only dream about, yeah
So baby come be my dream girl, pick a fantasy and let me work it out, yeah, oh yeah

You know you're the flyest, they should call you your highness
And call me king 'cause I'm that dude, and all you gotta do is leave your crew
Said I don't mean to brag, but I live a life that most can only dream about, yeah
So baby come be my dream girl, pick a fantasy and let me work it out, yeah, oh yeah
