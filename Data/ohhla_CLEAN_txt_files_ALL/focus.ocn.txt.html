[Frank Ocean]
Yeah I know I'm probably wastin my time
But listen yeah - I got some shit on my mind
I know it's obvious that I'm the talk of the town
It seem the more fame you get the more they bringin you down
Everywhere I go it's a media frenzy
All they seem to care about is me, Kim or Lindsey
Is the story real? You don't even know
Do you even care? Yeah I thought so

Yeah yeah I know they wanna see me

[Chorus]
Focus {*3X*}
I gotta get back to the money, I'm losin
Focus {*3X*}
I gotta get back to the money

[repeat first verse] + [Chorus]

[repeat 2X]
I'm back at it
Automatic

[Chorus] - repeat 2X</pre>
