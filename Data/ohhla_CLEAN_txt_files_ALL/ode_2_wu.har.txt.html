Song:   Ode 2 the Wu
Typed by: Tha Masta

[Intro: Black Jesus]
Wu, Wu, Wu, Wu
Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang
Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang
SUUUUUUUUUUUU!!!!!

[Black Jesus]
Meth, Ghost, Rae, The RZA (uh-huh)
Inspectah Deck, U-God and The GZA (Okay)
O.D.B. and of course, Masta Killa
And I can't forget the other Wu familia
I'ma take you back to '94, I was a kid with rap dreams
They taught me how to Protect my Neck, the manual for getting CREAM
Inspired by these brothers, I knew that I could do it too
But never thought The RZA, would bless us with The W
Thought Method Man Brung the Pain?
I'ma show you what's gon' happen once the Harlem 6 done got in the game
We gon' add on to the legacy, that's more goons, a bigger threat
We'll hit you with harpoons, smoke you like a cigarette
I come from the 'jects, I know about the hallways
Sipping on St. Ide's and puffing weed all day
It's well known, Nothing to Fuck Wit
That's why meeting now, we never die, so go here with this
It's something

[Chorus: all]
This is Ode 2 the Wu, in '93 they changed the game
From the slums of Shaolin came the 36 Chambers
Only Built 4 Cuban Linx had the streets going crazy
Everybody was screaming M-E-T-H-O-D, Man
It was a plan, all RZA's tracks turned major
And Ghostface set the pace when he hit y'all with Ironman
While GZA and U-God came with Deck to Inspect
For the late great O.D.B., Shame on you Niggaz that's hating

[Wil Power]
Since my youth I knew my duty would be
Playing with the suuu, Wu T-A-N-G Clan
Innovators for success, a whole new way of spitting
Made you sharpen ya skills in a lab and handle ya business
Meth gave you a threat, feeding you the disses
Chef came on ya set, recipes for ya kitchen
And Ironman launched the missles, threw you across the board
GZA came with that formula of Liquid Swords
RZA gave you, that Digital Bullet that got rid of you
Fakers and perpetrators, O.D.B., he would ridicule
Hip hop clothing line, Wu-Wear was Prophecy
Stomped the streets, matching hat and multi-colored Wallabees
The Harlem 6 is on the scene, watching all the odds increase
The rebirth movement, the new vision to the streets
And you best believe, this time we play for keeps
The Swarm of newborns, that's ready to take the East

[Chorus]

[Yung Man]
It's Harlem, Strong Island to Brook Zu
Throw the guns up in the air if you rep Wu
We go hard, when I was younger never thought that I'd be a part
of the movement that was too thick to break apart
Here's a blueprint for any group trying to make it large
R.I.P. to O.D.B., peace to the God
Shout outs to, G.P. Wu and the Killarm'
Sunz of Man, The Royal Fam and the Cappadon'
15 years up in the game, and just getting started
We ain't back, we never left, nigga, I beg ya pardon
Get to stepping, keep it moving, we run this market
Harlem 6, the chosen few to take out the garbage
We do what most won't do, do it with honor
No more riding the bandwagon, don't even bother
We Ain't Nothing to Fuck With, yeah you know the motto
This is Ode 2 the Wu, you got a problem, holla

[Chorus]</pre>
