[Intro: Usher]
Gotta do it for the ladies
And I gotta keep it hood
Where we at Polo (*Ayyy*)
I see you Ryan
Yo Keith nigga you was right
But we just gettin' started
Yeah man...

[Verse 1: Usher]
You see you searchin' for a nigga
That'll take you out and do you right (do you right)
Well come here baby and let daddy show you what it feel like (feel &gt; like)
You know all you gotta do is tell me what you sippin' on (sippin' on)
And I promise that I'm gonna keep it comin' all night long

[Chorus]
Lookin' in your eyes while you walk the other side
And I think that shorty I've got a thing for you
Doin' it on purpose winding and workin' it
I can tell by the way you lookin' at me girl

I wanna make love in this club *ayy*
(make love in this club *ayy*, in this club *ayy*, in this club *ayy* )
I wanna make love in this club *ayy*
(in this club *ayy*, in this club *ayy*, in this club *ayy* )

[Verse 2: Usher]
You got some friends rollin' with you baby then that's cool
You can leave them with my niggas let em know that I got you
If you didn't know, you're the only thing that's on my mind
Cuz the way I'm staring miss you got me wantin to give it to you all
night

Lookin' in your eyes while you walk the other side
I can't take it no more
Baby I'm comin' for you
You keep doin' it on purpose winding and working it
If we close our eyes it could be just me and you

I wanna make love in this club *ayy*
(in this club *ayy* , in this club, *ayy* in this club *ayy* )
I wanna make love in this club *ayy*
(in this club *ayy* , in this club *ayy* , in this club *ayy* )
I wanna make love in this club *ayy*
(in this club *ayy* , in this club, *ayy* in this club *ayy* )
I wanna make love in this club *ayy*
(in this club *ayy* , in this club, *ayy* in this club *ayy* )
(I got this - yeaa - let's go!)

[Verse 3: Young Jeezy]
I'm what you want, I'm what you need
He got you trapped, I'll set you free
Sexually, mentally, physically, emotionally
I'll be like your medicine, you'll take every dose of me
It's going down on aisle 3, I'll bag you like some groceries
And every time you think about it you gon' want some more of me
Bout to hit the club, make a movie yeah rated R
Pulled up like a trap star
That's if you have yo regular car
You wanna make love to a thug in the club with his ice on
'87 jeans and a fresh pair of Nikes on
On the couch, on the table, on the bar, or on the floor
You can meet me in the bathroom yeah you know I'm trying go

[Verse 4: Usher]
Might as well give me a kiss
If we keep touching like this
I know you scared, baby
They don't know what we doin'
Let's both get undressed right here
Keep it up girl and I swear
I'ma give it to you non-stop
And I don't care who's watchin'(watchin, watchin watchin...)

I wanna make love in this club *ayy*
(in this club *ayy* , in this club, *ayy* in this club *ayy* )
I wanna make love in this club *ayy*
(in this club *ayy* , in this club, *ayy* in this club *ayy* )

Ayy (repeat 4x)</pre>
