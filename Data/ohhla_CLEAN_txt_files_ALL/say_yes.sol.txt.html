Song:   Say Yes
Typed by: Cno Evil

[Bridge: Solomon Childs]
Say yes, baby...
Say yes, baby...
Say yes, baby...

[Chorus 2X: Solomon Childs]
I'll be your backup, baby, when he acting wrong
I'll be your backup, when you crying over love songs
I'll be your backup, baby, and teach you how he should
I'll be your backup, and make you feel real good

[Solomon Childs]
Excuse me, baby girl, why you frowning?
This kind of girl was just laughing when I be clowning
Hey, hey, no disrespect, your legs...
Look like they need some poundings
You from the suburbs? As for me, I'm from housings
Fifth borough, Shaolin
Where them dogs be howling (roof!)
Only reason I said that, to let you know I can protect you
As well as hold you, walk in the park with you
Share a vanilla shake with you
Catch a movie together, shit
We can cuddle in front of whoever

[Chorus 2X]

[Solomon Childs]
Listen, turn around for me
Damn, how in the hell he let you get away?
With a walk that'll melt the ice cream
In the Mr. Softee truck
You even got Roscoe in uniform looking at your big ol' butt
See, girl, I've been checking you out
Light-skinned, tongue ring in your mouth
Teeth pearly white, so sweet and nice
Like lemonade and ice
Let's not talk about what he did wrong
He messed up, and now he gone
And this is me putting my pit in
For something real strong, I treat you real, girl

[Chorus 2X]

[Hook 2X: Solomon Childs]
Baby girl, is you a wild thing, wild thing
You make a thug wanna change things, change things
And where you got them ballers spending chips
On bracelets and kicks, proves you nothing to mess with

[Chorus 2X]
