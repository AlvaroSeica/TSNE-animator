So I'm watching her fine ass walk to my bedroom
And thought to myself that's the shape of things to come
She said, "Why in the club, you don't make it precipate?
You know, make it rain when you could make it thunderstorm?"
I'm like, why? The world needs sun. The hood needs funds
There's a war going on and half the battle is guns
How dare I throw it on the floor
When people are poor
So I write like Edgar Allen to restore
Got a cord, umbilical, attached to a place that can't afford
No landscaping or window draping
This old lady told me if I ain't got nothing good, say nay-thing
That's why I don't talk much. I swear it don't cost much
To pay attention to me
I tell it like it is and then I tell it how it could be
The hood be requesting my services
Oh, don't get nervous it's
Step your game up time. These ain't them same old rhymes
Designed to have you dancing in some club
Niggas ride to me; women beat off in their tub
Exfoliating with their poms poms yelling, "Go 3000."
I'm in my whatever bumping +nwa, + +100 Miles and Runnin'+
Runnin', Runnin', Runnin', Runnin'
Summon, woman. Come in. Sit down
Heard you need some plumbing
Done and Im in a swell mood, a rather swole mood
Until she told me that she told dude
That shell be back, shes going to the store
I didnt know she had a boyfriend so the door
I pointed her to. I said, "Call me when y'all break up
I dont fuck nobody's bitch and never owned a Jacob."
Know what time it is
Nigga just trying to live like a nigga supposed to live
If I still drank that malt liquor, Id pour the beer
On the ground for niggas not around. I started off starving
Now they got me out here +Brett Favre+ing
Trying see if I still got it; got it
I guess its like a bike. Think about it
Bout it, bout it

[Marsha Ambrosius: Hook x2]
Nothing going to stop us now
You can't stop us
What you going to do right now
You can't front
We the boss in here, we floss this year cuz
Ain't nobody doing it like we do
Oh no

[Big Boi]
So I peeped this bitch in the whip I used to clip like Rob the barber
It seems she couldn't shape up. Cupcake her; I didn't bother
She's a follower; a hell of a swallower not a leader
Got a first, second, third and fourth string. I didn't need her
I didn't mean to treat her like she was the main feature presentation
Her just a traitor to these situations
More like a hassle because she had no keys to the castle
The queen sits on the throne while this hoe rides down Old National
Zoom. Go ahead hoe and beat your feet
Dr-dr, drop down and get your eagle on freak
We ever so discrete with this meat
Got a whole lot to lose if paparazzi ever shot or shoot we
Meaning me and you. Us together and the lens
My 'ins would be gone just like some dro in the wind
Told the hoe, "You going to win. Sure enough we going to pretend
To the land of make believe. Now come on and hit this hen."
Taking shots to the neck
Now that's love in your mou-outh now we're affiliates
So don't give me the gangster grill. No drama. It makes no sense
I got a mean-ass backhand and a +Cannon+ that don't miss, bitch
