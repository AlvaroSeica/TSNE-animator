Just another day where my tears are falling, descending
Pain inside is never ending, cannot put it in a sentence
Everybody's condescending, I'm not broken but bending
And I'm about to snap fast! How am I representing
All the people that are pretending to love you forever
But better yet, they never get all your letters whenever
You take the effort to tell them your feelings, every endeavor
Feeling tethered together, you better get up and sever

Your oppressor and aggressor, the voice of freedom
Could never be deafer but I'd rather beat 'em than feed 'em
I know it's hard to imagine having a fleet of defeated credence
You're bleeding and need to be treated, speaking the streak is completed

You need to be seated-standing, demanding
That someone you love is planning and fanning flames you commanded
I know you have an advantage but I'll be damned if you manage
To vanish and leave me stranded with all the lives that you've damaged, damnit

People say that money talks- my cash hollers
Sweet talked your mom and got ass for twenty dollars
My name is Mr. Pollard but I'm known as a scholar
Because I hit it like I hit the books, pop it like a collar

Make me sick to my stomach- feeling my abdominals
This kid is phenomenal, how can we possibly monitor
Something like this? It's too hot, get a thermometer
Claim to have class but your ass shops at Hollister

I'm a nuisance, abusive to music
Get on a track and lose it, leave a few bruises
I'm using confusion that you find amusing
Constantly improving, that's why I'm a nuisance
[x2]

I avenge and set trends; your friends are meeting their ends
Revenge offends anybody that takes a defense
Hence, it makes sense to vent at other's expense
I get intense with suspense, here's the consequence

I put bitches in stitches and pitch you in the ditches
Trigger finger' itching, insistent on getting riches
Reach into your britches; clean our pockets like some dishes
You're too submissive and I'm getting to kissing your missus

I'm mentally stressed, eventually death
Will come and empty my chest so there ain't nothing left
I'm taking a breath, lungs vibrating my breast
Coincidentally blessed and incrementally tested

I know it's heroic to go and show it; yo I'm a poet
I'm growing up- dynamite, I'm blowing up
Throw it up- grab a machete already if you're ready
To make confetti with this money- I'm insane

I'm a nuisance, abusive to music
Get on a track and lose it, leave a few bruises
I'm using confusion that you find amusing
Constantly improving, that's why I'm a nuisance
[x2]

How can I possibly elevate my philosophy?
To become the hottest artist- it was said inside the prophecy
According to Socrates, you can't possibly copy me
I'm the dopest rapper rocking, you can stop with sodomy

I've had it with mediocrity' you've turned what was probably
The hottest cultural move in the planet into an oddity
Every record sounds the same, stop with the monotony
You've made it all a comedy by constantly
Making it a novelty, please hand me an apology
And honestly, I could probably forgive if it was modestly
Said, but instead, you keep acting so uncommonly
And quite frankly, I'm gonna punish that anomaly

People look at me the way they look at pornography
How can he possibly do that shit and do it so properly?
And how can he shoot off at the mouth with that much velocity?
Wow, this is some good stuff, this kid's got some quality

I'm a nuisance, abusive to music
Get on a track and lose it, leave a few bruises
I'm using confusion that you find amusing
Constantly improving, that's why I'm a nuisance
