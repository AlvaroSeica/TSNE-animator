[INTRO]
Ooh yeah, it's the Macho Man Randy Savage
and we're about to drop it on you like this
Check it out, here we go

[VERSE 1]
OOOH Yeah We got the power and we're ready to wreck
With a force so deadly it'll snap ya neck
OOOH Yeah we're about to put this thing in motion
We'll hit ya so hard you'll have a body convulsion
OOOH Yeah We've been kickin' butt way too long
So don't get us wrong cuz we're way too strong
OOOH Yeah Anyone wants to test the king
It ain't no thing just step in the ring

[CHORUS]
Let's Go Baby Come On Tear It Up
Let's Roll Baby Come On Kick Some Butt
Everybody Step Back cuz we're comin' too strong
So Let's Get It On (what) Let's Get It On (what)

Let's Go Baby Come On Tear It Up
Let's Roll Baby Come On Kick Some Butt
Everybody Step Back cuz we're comin' too strong
So Let's Get It On (what) Let's Get It On (what)

[VERSE 2]
OOOH Yeah I don't think you wanna mess with us
Cuz we'll slam ya on the ground now ya coughin' up dust
OOOH Yeah it's not wise to mess with Randy
Cuz you'll catch a beatdown to the third degree
OOOH Yeah you don't believe me bring it on dude
I'd advise that you don't cuz I'm not in the mood
OOOH Yeah me get beat's not part of the plan
So you're about to feel the wrath of the Macho Man

[CHORUS 2x]
