[Intro: Shabazz the Disciple]
Yeah, this be the 4th Chapter
From The Book of Shabazz, word
Sitting in that church, praising the lord
With the congregation, yo, yo, yo

[Shabazz the Disciple]
I used to, sit in the church and hear the father preach
With him catching the holy ghost, and shaking right in they fucking seats
And passing out and catching seisures
And swallowing they tongues, worshipping pictures hung, of Jesus
Never could understand the moments, people shouting and people foaming
Giving me visions of The Omen
Preachers preaching for righteous, with they wicked ways
And when they pass the offering, man, I stole the money out the trays
I had to purify my holy temple, and crucify the flesh
Now I'm dwelling in the spirit and in the mental

[Chorus 2X: Shabazz the Disciple]
Is it in God who they really trust?
Cuz I seen many fallen victims who been beat and lust
Masters that been turned to ashes and grains of dust
Incarcerates of the flesh, this is ya exodust

[Shabazz the Disciple]
I'm reaching out to all my brethren and my sistren
It doesn't matter if you Muslim or you Christian
Or Athiest or Baptist or Israelian
Jehovah Witness, Catholic or Rastafarian
I hear the voice of one crying in the wilderness
Who climbed the wrong side out of the mountain on the pilgrimage
Narrow is the path, and wide is the pearly gate
Fall in the mist of hatred, just uphold your seal of fate
His death and ministry alters your chemistry (why?)
Buries the vision, makes it hard for them to see (why?)
My holy arm shall raise the flag of victory
So praise the Lord and raise your sword and follow me
Cuz I seen many men cast down, ruled it
They had to beat up on the path and got my ruler
They went astray and sold they souls and he consumed it
They had the vision, lost their focus and they lose it

[Chorus 2X]

[Shabazz the Disciple]
The preacher man is mister sheist
Just put the money in the panty, don't give a damn about Christ
You noticed how in every ghetto there's a liquor store
A funeral parlor, in the church, where they grip the poor
I be the author of his written death day
He's in checkmate, put on your armor hats and breastplates
I'm not the reverend preaching on your false Sabbath
More like the one that came and taught the Mathematics
I walked the edgings of the Earth and never went astray
Many religions locked my path but went cast away
My thoughts be traveling at speeds and higher altitudes
Six feet above the surface, at your all and stack it too
It takes a million years to follow where the God is at
And if I'm traveling too fast follow my star attack
Lord have mercy, we living in the last days
I'm stretching out my hands to the grave
To raise the dead, and pull you out the denial
The maze in your head is leading to the fire
Inhale this breath of gospel, through your nostril
Exhale the mist, the moist and dry fossils
I hear the screams of the souls of the wounded
That need to be held, cuz they religion has failed
The Anti-Christ, pick of the sacrifice, your precious life
Apsiring knowledge of self, it helps your melt the ice
The holy force, the scent of a holocaust
So take the nails out ya hands and feet and climb off the cross
I'm like the cloud that rains on God's sons and daughters
It's up to the children to absorb the holy water

[Chorus]</pre>
