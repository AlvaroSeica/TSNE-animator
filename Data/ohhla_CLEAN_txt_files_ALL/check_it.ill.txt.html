Yo yo yo..
What I want you to do on this one Illogic is..
Show all these people, what kind of styles you got..
Cause the true test, of any MC, is his versatility..
So get on this mic, and show these heads what you got..
Yeah..

[Illogic]
Yo, yo, so you wanna try battlin?
I know time will tell my prime but I paddle time for tattlin
I'm on some, kind of, time to, hypno-tize a hypnotist
Verbally you're vaginal
Take this stiff mic and split your lips
Lyrically I'm picturesque and you're not photogenic
My shadow gets tripped up tryin to mimic
In memory mention me mentally, starvin put simplistically
Pardon but waitin for you my mind would malnourish
While my style flourish, try not to bother it
Cause with your intellect
you couldn't stay atop your flow with a scholarship
Holla if, ya hearin this, conceal I'm revealin gets
you higher than heaven so then it's now an execution
You feelin this?

It's Illogic on the mic, check it out y'all

Purified skill I demonstrate as the wack is eliminated
I could cum off with a vasectomy and you struggle masturbatin
For this rendition I need some competition
Some type of challenger cause I smash, melons like Gallagher
with strength you're weak/week like one line of a calendar
Amateur - here's a warning, I keep it live, and you're snorin
I'm so hot my conception was the initials stages of global warmin
Stormin kids, typhoon-like when the mic ignites I strike tykes
that take flight to lights of elevated height, cloggin pipes up when
Bend men on the regular, sever ya, flavor ya lac-tates
You to beatin me has the probability of lightning striking
three times in the same place, but I make haste
Cause I'm destined for great things like the fetus of Jesus
With wisdom I confuse the color schemats of prisms
I manipulate mics like the Nation of Islam to attack men
and leave wack men endangered like the species of black men
I'm on the prowl and, usually disembowelin my attacker
And for some reason I got this habit of chain-smokin rappers

Mr. Dibbs in the house, check it out y'all
Signify in the house, check it out y'all
G. Fresh in the place, check it out y'all
Apple G., check it out, check it out, check it out y'all..

At times, my metaphors are hard for me to catch and I threw 'em
Heads I flew 'em ran through 'em with the quickness
Synpatic shutdown, what noun can haunt the pronoun for progressing?
So aesthetically profund, I got nuns undressing
Let's slowww down, impossible cut throttle to light speed
This ya gotta see facts spittin so sick I'll need a colostomy bag
Resistance is too foul, I'm advancin hands when raps adapt
I'm so dope and you're so wack
You now defy the law that opposites attract
Herb you don't got the nerve to test me
Cause my mind is so quick
you'd think my thoughts are goin the speed of sound on a jet ski
You're rockin name brands but you don't impress me
If I was your breath, while takin a rest, you couldn't catch me
Respect me you're gettin cancelled like Matlock
Cut short like a half-top
Stop, I told ya now I gotta fold ya like a laptop
You wonder why you can't get me it's cause you're not thinkin
Cause yo I flip more styles 
than a couch potato flips channels in a weekend
