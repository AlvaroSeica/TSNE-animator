[Intro: 2Pac]
Yeah... clear enough for ya (Is that right)
(Hahahahaha) Yeah
(Hehehehe) Why niggaz look mad (Is that right)
Y'all supposed to be happy I'm free!
Y'all niggaz look like y'all wanted me to stay in jail, hahah!
Hoe bustaz

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Picture me rollin in my 500 Benz
I got no love for these niggaz, there's no need to be friends
They got me under surveillance, that's what somebody be tellin'
Know there's dope bein sold, but I ain't the one sellin!
Don't want to be another number
I got a fuckin gang of weed to keep from goin under
The federales wanna see me dead - niggaz put prices on my head
Now I got two Rottwillers by me bed, I feed em lead
Now I'm released, how will I live Will God forgive me
for all the dirt a nigga did, to feed kids
One life to live, it's so hard to be positive
when niggaz shootin' at your crib
Mama, I'm still thuggin', the world is a war zone
My homies is inmates, and most of them dead wrong
Full grown, finally a man, just scheamin on ways
to put some green inside the palms of my empty hands
Just picture me rollin
Flossin a Benz on rims that isn't stolen
My dreams is censored, my hopes are gone
I'm like a fiend that finally sees when all the dope is gone
My nerves is wrecked, heart beatin and my hands is swollen
thinkin of the G's I'll be holdin', picture me rollin

[Chorus: Danny Boy]
Picture, picture me, picture me rollin
Rollin, picture me rollin
Wheelin, picture me rollin in
Picture me yea yeah

[2Pac speaking over Danny Boy chorus]
Can you see me now Heheheh
Move to the side a little bit so you can get a CLEAR picture
Can you see it Hahah
Pictue me rollin
Yeah nigga!

[Verse 2: Hussein Fatal]
I've got a mind full of money
The beat is who I talk to
And without any pain
Picture me rolling on a raw crew
But now I'm selling remix this
It don't matter how they try to do it
Homie we did shit
The truth and them cowards can quote us
But they don't tell the truth in their muses
Cuz they might promote us
The money don't stop when a nigga get knocked off
The world don't stop cuz the homie get popped off
We far away from manage
But we right where the static at
And we'll stand around to get money
And niggaz mad at that
Mama ain't raised no chump
So when it's on I'm on it
Pump 12 (Outlaw) gauge ready to dump

[Verse 3: Young Noble]
Listen he rather see me dead or in jail
Than to see me rich
That's why I drive by slow take a picture bitch
I'm in a tinted black 745
On the grind getting back what's mine
Middle finger to the law
Realest that you ever saw
Living my life and I'm a die a fucking Outlaw
We on the verge of greatness
The hood embraced it
From the corner to the cell blocks
The coldest entry
From the bricks of Compton
Made nigga mafiatize you hear me
Killer Kadafi sunrise
Listen can you picture all my cheques getting bigger
These niggaz expect pressure and we only getting better
You feel me (Outlaw)

[Chorus: Danny Boy]
Picture, picture me, picture me rollin
Rollin, picture me rollin
Wheelin, picture me rollin in
Picture me yea yeah

[2Pac speaking over Danny Boy chorus]
Can you see me now Heheheh
Move to the side a little bit so you can get a CLEAR picture
Can you see it Hahah
Pictue me rollin
Yeah nigga!

[Verse 4: EDI]
I got my two tone C
Wind is blowing big
And I find that I'm somewhere on the way to getting rich
I ain't tripping on a wish
My mind on cash
I'm just hating motherfuckers thinking I aint' gonna last (what)
I can't get wrecked
Rep built on repect
If you ain't about some chips or a cheque
Eat a dick (yeah)
I'm shining on my shoes when I cruise
Niggaz get the blues
Hoes go woo
When they see how the roof moves
Dude is a fool man the cops can't touch (No)
Hood niggaz love here idolish
Cold to the glocks straight love
They wishing something to end
Then I'm rolling
Picture me rolling
(Ha Ha)

[Chorus: Danny Boy]
Rollin
Picture me roll-hoee-ollin
Picture me, picture me rollin

[Outro: 2PAC speaking over Danny Boy chorus]
