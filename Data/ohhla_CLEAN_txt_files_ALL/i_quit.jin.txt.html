Typed by: OHHLA.com

Man, I was just tryin to eat
is this what happens?
yo I'mma do this in one take
cause if I gotta do it again
it just wasn't meant to be...
yo Golden Child, I owe you big time for this joint yo
that's my word
people, feel me

I sit up nights let the beat loop
contemplate what to write
think you got me figured out
but you'll never know what its like
to live my life the attempts to live up to hype
of being the nicest Asian to ever lift the mic
if I bite the dust while I'm writin this song
then I might just end up right where I belong
amongst legends that's how y'all should
remember me gone but forever existent in a memory
so I never ask for applause
if all goes well I'll leave this earth due to a natural cause
picture me with my grandkids 60 years old
watchin BET footage from 40 years ago
like "ya grandfather he use to be a beast
when it came time to battle
ain't nobody wanna piece"
the way I tell the story they amazed I'm older
tellin me "grandpa ya glory days is over"
flashback to the present moment
where the real battles just gettin started
and I'm my own opponent
ready to call it quits but gettin the busy tone
I might stop by radio and pull a Bizzy Bone
see my whole life changed in the last 4 years
a lot of laughter but definitely not without tears
I watched the Asian rap community grow
first there was none
now theres a few cats that nobody knows
I suppose they label me the one that was chosen
to open doors for those that were normally closed
who oughta get props I composed a list
in no particular order yo it goes like this
YungMAC the protégé LS is a beast
lyrically Snacky Chan Thai &amp; FAReast
Liv n proof Shogun K Grey I'm wit ya
we gota open our eyes and see the bigger picture
Jargon INVAZN On Fire get props REIGN ERA
Mountain Brothers holla at me Chops!
If I didn't mention ya name don't take it as a diss
you got my support if you takin it serious
sometimes my efforts seem unappreciated
I know I ain't shit!! but hey at least I made it
this far for y'all that didn't wish me success
heres my biggest flaw I still wish y'all the best
and thru it all I kept a level head listened
to GOD and ignored what the devil said
I can't leave rap alone the game needs me
hard to let go cause none of this came easy
how many times do I gotta prove myself!?
do I really gotta battle EM and Lose Myself!??
106 The Fight Klub Smack DVD
a classic CD well at least it was to me
what else can you do to me
I went to war with the radio station on behalf of my community
bout to retire pull a Hova I quit
no more its over for Jin I'm tired that's it</pre>
