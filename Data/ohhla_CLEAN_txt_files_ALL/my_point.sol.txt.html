Song:   My Point of View
Typed by: Cno Evil

[Chorus: sample]
Talking bout my, talking bout my
Talk, talk, talk, talk, talking bout my
Point of view... point of view...
Talking bout my, point of view... point of view...

[Solomon Childs]
Red violence, street gauntlets
Bolivian coke, pure in my government's horses
Niggas talking, we talk the streets, the street talk
I heard too many stories bout these niggas are soft
I don't even live in ya hood, it's nothing
You live your life, kid, it's all good
Me, I'm taking mine, east coast
This the real fever, without all that Die Hard, Bruce Willis shit
Make you wonder who's real and who's counterfeit
8th wonder of the world, heroine
Killa Mob, Iron Maiden, lick 'em with the P45
Far from playing, this is business, I understand you cool
But this is bidness, I'll shot ya spine out ya back
Niggas is dumb, a baby can understand
Niggas don't listen, til the heat claps

[Chorus]

[Solomon Childs]
I live in violence, shit, I move like the FOI, silence
Was taught by my old earth, since the bird of a phoenix
You got to show 'em you need it, you got to show 'em you willing
To extort it, can't stagnate yourself with bullshit or bullshit riches
Bullshit niggas, crooked cocaine connects
Relocating the fiends, dirty guns imported from the M13
That's why I'm bringing back float, potent
Like eighty five jars of water
Any objections, to this is my court room
Addressing criminal order, yellow back cowards
You niggas, I'mma undress ya with the quarters
Something small, bring sudden light
Huh, cuz I'm about that money like Quincy Jones
Get it right

[Chorus]

[Solomon Childs]
Uh, so P. Diddy let loose of them diamonds
Donald Trump let loose of them diamonds
50 Cent let loose of them diamonds
Bill Gates let loose of them diamonds
And them emeralds, scream mercy
Let this weight, the generals
Or the leaders that was hit in the head
Like Caesar, I'mma throw the crowd bread
Come on...
