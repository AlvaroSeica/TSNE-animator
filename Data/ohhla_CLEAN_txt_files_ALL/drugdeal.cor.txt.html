It is a plant, not a demon
It is a teacher, it is a healer
Roots within our mother's skin
One who gives, freely

Who are you, so full of lies
I am human, I'm alive
Who are you to dictate rights
What you see is not our sight

God made it, men use it
Governments put people in cages for it
God made it, men use it
Governments put people in cages for it

Shiny green, above the sky
I see her and she looks so nice
I feel her and I ask you why
Who are you to dictate rights

Who are you, so full of lies
I am human, I'm alive
Who are you to dictate rights
What you see is not our sight

God made it, men use it
Governments put people in cages for it
God made it, men use it
Governments put people in cages for it</pre>
