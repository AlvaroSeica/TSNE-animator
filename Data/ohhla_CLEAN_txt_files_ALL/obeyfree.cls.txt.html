[Intro]
{*laughs*}
My turn to rock..
(Twisted)

[CL Smooth]
Now meet the carmel king of the castle
Keepin it tight, CL Smooth sippin on Sprid-ite
It's this Mecca Don, never swervin untitled
Knowin commercial rap needs to be recycled (woo.. aw yeah!)
Collectin cans for nicks, pitch my latest LP
Now obey my thirst son precisely

[Pete Rock]
I got the knack to rock, I'm steady heatin up the spot
The Chocolate Boy Wonder makin heads bop
Plus I... {*laughs and cracks up*}</pre>
