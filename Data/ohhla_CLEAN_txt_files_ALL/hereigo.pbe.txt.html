Here i go, i don¹t give a damn if you wit me
Stupidity, shit i¹m the reverse of jiggy
All that prettiness running on empty
Only wusses need pity, no i ain¹t from the city
5 minutes of fame if you don¹t know my name
Oh yeah, i¹m that field nigga they all fear
Here¹s a madd salute to all my troops
Fuck a lawyer and the law and all them suits
I spits and i vomit cause i come like a comet
Better quit it if yall don¹t know what yall gettin from it
Just forget it if you wit it, that racket runnin it
Come on come with it, i think i¹ll fit it
Go to war but what the hell i¹m fightin for
As i soar yeah baby i like it raw
No cigar, i ran over the pop star wit my car, 
Again and may the best jam win...

Here i go ---- there you go

Bingo, it don¹t matter if this platter¹s a single
Needin needles like the beatles needin ringo
From the beginnin i told you how to see thru the linen
All that talk but that¹s the way
The side walks in new york
I simplify cause you might be high
Rip shit in the pit so what you don¹t like it
This is man shit a hip hop trip
On that aggressive tip but rap got pussy whipped
Got out psyched down on that turnpike
I knew this philly who just wouldn¹t get right
Cause i was aware as a square in delaware
Execs writing checks for sex in spandex
Radios gettin sucked by labels under the table
Mix dj¹s gettin overpaid for airplay
Try to shut me down like ray, what i say?
Fuck your friends and may the best jam win

Here i go ---- there you go

Mirror mirror i¹m finger pointin at the man
It is i, i interrupt the program
Chuck d rubberneckin with the fans
Pe don¹t give a damn about uncle sam
And on and on like i said before 
Some, the 100 meter dash, i¹m the marathon
Against the grain comin like a train
As you listen to the sounds that remains insane
One on one and it¹s just begun 
To get out the ghetto and get something done
To be the man you gotta beat the man
Don¹t confuse me with being dumb or bubble gum
And i¹ll be here as you disappear
And i¹ll be around amongst the crowd
Cause anything i wear is a step on down
That¹s how i¹ve always been
And may the best jam win...
