[Intro: Apocalipps]
DJ Storm, Wats collaboration
Apocalipps, double homicide, motherfuckers, kill 'em
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo

[Bridge: Apocalipps]
Tell em to, cock your gun and blaze
I want to fill him up with holes if he misbehaves
Cop something and blaze
My niggas on the corner with the 20's of haze

[Apocalipps]
Yo, I aint tryin to wait for this deal from Warner Brother
I'm trying to sling, so if you see the police, warn a brother
I scramble on these blocks, my gun handle is rubber
This crack won't go, I gotta sell this shit to your mother
Apocalipps, I'm way ahead of my time
So you probably won't really feel my shit till like two thousand and nine
I got thousands of rhymes, shit that can go through your vest
I cut your ears off, now you can sign with So So Def
My shit is unrestricted, fuck it, I run through your district
And make a tray for the cake once I show you the biscuits
And everything is on the line, but sometimes you gotta risk it
I do a stick up so fast, if you blink you'll probably miss it
I'm Apocalipp-tic, and I'm feelin at my best today
And you can't get it now, just like you could of got it yesterday
You throwin up blood, the doctors put you on a respirator
Blow up your thugs, I put a bomb under your Escalade
Go ahead, try to ball, your shit get stamped
I got these fake niggas tryin to cop some Limpton plants
And I done did so much shit, so many niggas got hit
A lot of cats mistaken me to be a Blood or a Crip
But the only gang I run with is a gang full of guns
In my set, I claim this tech hammer, banging your lungs
Throw it up, nigga, I rep mines, no holding me back
Again, all praises due to my OG Macs
They loaded with caps, black strap over my back
And I can kill you on the streets and you know I kill you on wax
I spit at your seeds, Cali style, spit at your V
You realize a nigga's wack once he spit after me, you see?
