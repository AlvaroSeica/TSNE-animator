K.FLAY:
Not two weeks ago in the mail I got a ticket
From the Millbrae 5-0 listing crimes committed
Had a picture of a lady in a car that wasn't mine
But somehow identities became intertwined
Surveillance gone awry yo you got the wrong guy
She was the one who was running red lights
It's a set up, the government's corrupt
Now my State Farm's gonna go way up

MC LARS: How you gonna run a stop light say it wasn't you?
Keeping civil peace is what my peeps and me are gonna do
You're flaunting all your liberties like they don't mean a thing
Writing angry raps just to try and make a scene
But the government don't like it when you talk mad trash
Standing at the rally with a fat green sash
Like Free Iran, think you're Ayn Rand
So we'll trace your calls to deflate your evil plan

CHORUS:
In the walls, in the floors, in the halls, in the doors
In the sky, in the car, late at night from afar
Why you gotta be in my space?
Just doing my job, keeping you safe
On the phone line, email we know every detail
ATM pin codes, all up in my Gmail
It's like hide and seek
Can't a girl get a little privacy?

K.FLAY:
Pentopticon they say it makes us safer from the Taliban
But what we gonna do when all the laws are gone
Lock so-called criminals in Azkaban, it goes on and on
Diaries unloosed from underneath all the mattresses
Strip search striped shirt, that's only the half of it
Slipshod shut close cases concocted
How they seal the deal?
Evidence Photoshopped it

MC LARS:
It's 187 on the independent rapper,
Like Sister Souljah, hey let's ask her
Your words mean nothing, we're not scared of this
You're either down with us, or you're a terrorist
So don't believe the lies when you're in a state of war
And they're breaking down your door like it was 1984
There's no Oceanic double-speak contradiction because
Big Brother loves you and Orwell wrote fiction

CHORUS:
In the walls, in the floors, in the halls, in the doors
In the sky, in the car, late at night from afar
Why you gotta be in my space?
Just doing my job, keeping you safe
On the phone line, email we know every detail
ATM pin codes, all up in my Gmail
It's like hide and seek
Can't a girl get a little privacy?

MC LARS: Stand up, line up, let them know that you're here
Check in, check out, and fumigate your fear
Oh no, it's fine Uncle Sam's got your back
Forget the US troops shot dead in Iraq
CCTV everywhere all the time
Cause the FBI is even tapping your rhymes
Check philosophy from Socrates back in ancient Greece
There's no enlightenment if we can't increase the peace

K.FLAY:
No privacy they got us locked down
Satellites in the air spy cams on the ground
Every village, every city, every town
Tracking all our moves like a bloodhound
Yeah we're fucked as Huxley predicted
Snapping pics, falsely convicted, innocents interdicted
Kegs and wires similarly tapped
No way to get your ass off the map

CHORUS:
In the walls, in the floors, in the halls, in the doors
In the sky, in the car, late at night from afar
Why you gotta be in my space?
Just doing my job, keeping you safe
On the phone line, email we know every detail
ATM pin codes, all up in my Gmail
It's like hide and seek
Can't a girl get a little privacy?</pre>
