[Chorus]
Boom shaka-laka boom boom shaka-laka
Boom shaka-laka boom boom shaka-laka
Bangers
Biddy bye-bye
Fool... Fuss all your block, you get [?] on your block, yawk!

[Verse 1]
Grab your brownie sit the party
Shake the party break the party
Murder party leave the body tell nobody
Put it down, Figg Side rip ride
Groove line wig line shots fired knock knock YAWK
You ain't really bout that you don't want to see a Glock out
You a pussy ass nigga you be hoping for a cop out
Got a nine and a clip put a nine on your hip
Keep talking that shit, knock 5 on your lip
G-Ride ski masks colored rags contraband in bags
Focused on enemies in jags big sips out our flasks
We faded who next to get famous
Them bangers get banging that barrell keep changing like click click
Shit, I wish a nigga would, feeling fucking good
Crack and scramble up your hood get it understood
I could have cuhz leaking blood
Personal as fuck at your door drop you on your rug

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Ain't nothing sweet about rumbling with beasts
You don't need water to travel through the seas
Unravel the backwoods and crumble up the trees nigga please
Your skull missing now homie feel the breeze
These bullets burning gon' be hard for you to breathe
These bullets burning damn near possible to bleed
Off that alcohol that nozzle flammable
Beef I prey on my preyer react like animal
Pussy, I split you like camel toe
My shoelaces matching my flannel
We be loading up ammo
Ya'll be making them channels
Yellow tape by them candles
Gang members with killing sprees on our agendas
Real niggas fingers on nickel-plated 9 triggers
Facial expressions say surrender when that iron enter
Lay back recline nigga
Access denied nigga
Refrigerate Ziploc and all genders
Rather Crip or Piru hoes get it too

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Ya'll really into talking we with that bullshit
Them shots is steady sparking we on that bullshit
Your hood gon' hear them sirens we did that bullshit
My 50 niggas wildin' we bout that bullshit
You know Atlanta with that bullshit
New York to Miami with that bullshit
You know Chicago with that bullshit
Kansas City down to New Orleans with that bullshit
Texas to Alabama with that bullshit
Boston and cats from Philly with that bullshit
Arizona to Seattle they with that bullshit
Warn your mama California we 'bout that bullshit

[Chorus]</pre>
