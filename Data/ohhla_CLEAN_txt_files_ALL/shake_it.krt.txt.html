[Intro: Big K.R.I.T.]
Yeah, broadcasting to ya live from the third coast
I'm ready

[Chorus: Joi] - (w/ Big K.R.I.T. ad libs)
Let me take you higher-a-a-a-ohh (I told ya I can take ya higher baby)
Let me light your fire-a-a-a-ohh (Let me light your fire darling)
Oh, oh, oh, oh (Yeah)
Won't you shake it baby, shake it baby
shake it baby, shake it baby, shake it? (Oh no getting all shy now baby girl)
Can you take it baby, take it baby
take it baby, take it baby, take it? (Let me know, can you take it?)

[Big K.R.I.T.]
Now I was creeping across slow, in a candy '84
with the fifth wheel and a chandelier, and the elbows with Vogues
I was scooping up yellow, head game nothing better
that went down fourteen, ironically her first name Coretta
Her body is stellar, I told her that when I first saw her
in the strip club with her top off and her ass up like "Good Lord"
She had me pinned up in a corner
whispering that I could have her if I want her

[Chorus: Joi] - (w/ Big K.R.I.T. ad libs)
Let me take you higher-a-a-a-ohh (Let me take you higher baby)
Let me light your fire-a-a-a-ohh (Let me light your fire darling)
Oh, oh, oh, oh (Yeah)
Won't you shake it baby, shake it baby
shake it baby, shake it baby, shake it? (I know that's what you came here to do)
Can you take it baby, take it baby
take it baby, take it baby, take it? (I just wanna know, can you take it baby?)

[Big K.R.I.T.]
Now I was late night creeping on 'em in the pillow they was sleeping on
And her man, she was cheating on him for the chrome wheels that glide
On the old school with the plush seats that feel extra soft when you touch these
She'd get real freaky, wanna touch me and suck me as I drive
I said cool, she was thorough it, matter of fact, she was thoroughbred
as the light from the street twinkle off my chrome and the back of her silky head
Kinda crazy, trying not to crash my whip, but I'm kinda hazy
Kinda soaring, kinda high, told her one more time

[Chorus: Joi] - (w/ Big K.R.I.T. ad libs)
Let me take you higher-a-a-a-ohh (Up to the moon and the stars baby)
Let me light your fire-a-a-a-ohh (Make it shine baby, let's make it shine)
Oh, oh, oh, oh (Yeah)
Won't you shake it baby, shake it baby
shake it baby, shake it baby, shake it? (I know you don't think it's over yet)
Can you take it baby, take it baby
take it baby, take it baby, take it? (You ready? Let's go)

[Joi] - (w/ Big K.R.I.T. ad libs)
Won't you ride (won't you come aboard)
aboard my spaceship? (I just want you to shake it baby, everything that you got and more)
Can't you tell we going places? (If you can't tell by now that we going places...)
(One more time, alumnus, yeah)

[Outro: excerpt from the film "CB4"]
"I definitely don't like what's happening to you"
"Now just because I got a little bit of cash
 why does everybody gotta start bugging?"</pre>
