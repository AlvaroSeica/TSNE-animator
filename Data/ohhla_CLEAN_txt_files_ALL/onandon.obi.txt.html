[Intro]
Ha ha! Yeah! Ha ha! Yeah!
Aiyyo-yo, aiyyo-yo!
Obie Trice, yo!
Nuttin nice, yo!
Where the fuck, my niggaz at
Check check yo

[Obie Trice]
I had a vision to conquer the world with lyrical incisions on your brain
And blow this rap game
Introduce myself, the name's Obie Trice
Caramel complected, stay the hell away from vice
The fifth Spice, without a coochie
Never had lucci, Coogi or Gucci
Unruly, roll with niggaz that be moody
Talkin loud at the movies, checkin out your mom's booty
Don't fuck with cats that's fruity
Pull out the toolie on a nigga with a irregular size dukey
Sellin rocks to Pookie
Got my pockets fat, so fat at times it gets spooky
Makin moves with the uzi
In a truck when I scoop up the cutie from a different hood that I be
Raunchy, never drink Spumantie, it make me sick
Drunk it once, farted, truthfully shitted
Pitted, every time I piss for P.O.
So THC remains in the urine flow

[scratched samples by DJ Grouch]
"On and on"
"Obie Trice"
"My rhymes could never be compared to yours"
"On and on and on and on"
"And on and on and on-on-on"
"I was born to rip a.." - "Microphone"
"On and on, on and on, on and on and on, on"

[Obie Trice]
I'm too much - the type of kid that'll take your car
Burn out your clutch and really wouldn't give a fuck
A grunt, grudge holder, slug thrower
Mean-mug ignore ya, I just feed you to the boa
Bullshitter, when bitches bossy over dick
I tell 'em quit that, stand back, get off my shit
Thick lips, known for fuckin titty bar tricks
Nice size hips with a dozen of Ray Ray kids
Runnin the block like Bébé Kids in Atlanta
Hot! My temperature be Tony Montana
Y'all niggaz never smoke 'bama, speak with broken grammar
And if you talk shit I'ma slam ya

[Obie Trice]
Backs out ya tweeters, stage dive, me and Colt Seavers
Pullin out heaters on disbelievers
Grow like a Chia
Pettin all pussies non-poison, givin out gonorrhea
You can find me here, in ya ink
Open up notebooks and sink, deep between the sheets
We'll meet, "mano y mano"
Crack you with the 40-ounce bottle, until my style up full throttle
Offend MC's, that's the motto
Once I'm in this rap game ridin tracks, me in my Tahoe
Shippin platinum, Obie the +Well Known Asshole+
Fuck with it though, I guarantee a great asset
