[Verse One: Busta Rhymes]
See how I come again with another hit and I bang 'em
Gonna win every time I spit and I hang 'em
Another win whenever I get 'em and then I have 'em
I'm wildin all over the damn club now I'm bugged
Then I'm comin see the way I kill 'em when I bag 'em
Rub it in see the way I drill 'em and I drag 'em
Wonderin how I really hit 'em and I smaeh 'em
With another dose of the drug leave 'em on the run
Then I get 'em in the front hit 'em in the back
Then we hit 'em in the middle hit 'em high then we hit 'em low
Yes we get a little henny get alot of money
Gotta put it down every single time then I let 'em know
You can test the way I do it and the way they movin
And bouncin and shakin and shoutin and breakin
Amount that I'm makin and the noise I be makin
Every time that you be hatin sorry for keepin you waitin while I'm demonstratin
And we watchin the people participatin ain't no debatin
While I'm eliminatin look how we skatin all over them
Now playa play your position you yellin I'm dissin
You see the way he diss 'em make me waste 'em (Huh!)
From J.A. back to Trinidad gyal bad! (Bad!)
