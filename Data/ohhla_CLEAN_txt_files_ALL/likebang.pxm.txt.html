[Chorus]
I feel like bangin' a nigga
I feel like bangin' a nigga
I feel like bangin' a nigga
I feel like bangin' a nigga
I feel like bangin' a nigga
I feel like bangin' a nigga

[Verse One]
I had a fight last night and my name is Wood
I started whippin' up on a nigga, and the whippin' was good
The nigga booted up so I pulled my gat
One shot to the dome, and it was like that
You fuckin' with a gangster and if you didn't know
Smoke weed, get high and drink my Sisko
I don't give a fuck, when I start to strap
I'ma tell you like this I'm always strapped
Sonic boom, sonic boom on all these bitches
I even got somethin' for them nasty tricks
So if you think you gettin' ready, to pull that trigger
Then bitch I feel like bangin' a nigga

[Chorus]

[Verse Two]
Rat a tat, rat a tat, run for your gat
It ain't where ya from, it's where you at
Nigga's talk shit, like they always do
They might show a lil' stunt cuz they hangin' with the crew
Nigga's come to, then let's start fuck 'em
Strap a lil' wide, strap a crip, let's bust 'em
So boot up nigga, that's all I heard
Bitch slapped him in his mouth, and I ain't heard a word
I say bitch my nine is bigger, all you did was piss me off
So I'ma bang me a nigga

[Chorus]

[Bridge One]
Nobody move, nobody get hurt
Nobody move, nobody get's hurt
Nobody move, nobody get hurt
Nobody move, nobody get's hurt

[Verse Three- Big Heavy]
I brought my clip and my nine-millimeter
Nigga got mad, cuz I took his girl from the Cheetah
He wanted to strap, he wasn't ready to shoot
He didn't look real hard, but I was ready to boot
He was a Street Fighter, nigga knew me from the game
But an Downtown nigga ain't gonna never change
Jive ass nigga, wanna talk that shit 
But if he make one move, I'ma pop that clip
So nigga-da-nigga nigga-da-nigga I'm quick
To pull my trigger, trigger, trigger I'm quick to kill a nigga

[Chorus- Big Heavy]

[Bridge Two]
Third Ward nigga's gonna bang me a nigga
Forth Ward nigga's gonna bang me a nigga
Fifth Ward nigga's gonna bang me nigga
Eighth Ward nigga's might bang me a nigga
Ninth Ward nigga's gone bang me a nigga
Tenth Ward nigga's gone bang me a nigga
Thirteenth nigga's gonna bang me a nigga
Seventeenth nigga's gone bang me a nigga
West Bank nigga's gonna bang me a nigga
East Bank nigga's gonna bang me a nigga
Uptown nigga's gone bang me a nigga
Downtown nigga's gone bang me a nigga

[Chorus]

[Talking]
A nigga's ass bitch!</pre>
