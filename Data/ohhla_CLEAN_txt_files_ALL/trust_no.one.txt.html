(girl)
something told me

(lil one)
never trust
a soul

trust no one

(repeat)

well as I sit I make a fist
I'm commin the grips up with the wheel
I strugle as I wonder knowin that my days
are numbered. take a breath but do I care
knowin death is in the air? these bullets
lookin for me like the homie right before me
the caps from the bible territory be a saw me
these fools are pourin beers
while the mothers pourin tears
while the beers are for the name
while the tears are from the pain
that she feels never will she heal
cuz she's the one that's real
to the cause of your loss I can hear
it in the screams so depressin reminiscin
how she's feeling I'm only guessin
but the question now we're stressin
now begin to comprehend
as I'm lookin around ain't noone around
I'm all alone
and listen on how I be trippin on how these mutha fuckas
commin around and a bunch of them claimin to be your
boys your dogs breakin the laws
those are the ones I call pretenders fakers
shakin the hand of a man that is ready to take ya break ya
only pretendin to be tha g but see I be the one that be
knowin that's why I be showin no props and no one to trust
so hangin alone is a must.but better belive that'll i'll get em'
and wet em' forget em' and rather than let em' affetct me
makin em' all respect me

(chorus 6X)</pre>
