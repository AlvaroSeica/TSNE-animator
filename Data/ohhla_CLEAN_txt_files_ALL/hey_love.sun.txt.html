Hey love, you're the girl that I adore
Everytime you go away I want you more and more
But I see I want something I just can't have
So I hide my hurt with a simple laugh
Although that is a cover, so you won't discover
That I am jealous of your modern day lover
He couldn't give you all that I can
I can love, cherish and understand
How a girl like you deserves to be treated
Honesty, respect and love is needed
The feeling that I have is much too strong
If lovin you is wrong then I guess I'm wrong
Who wants to be right, I just want you
If only you knew what you are puttin me through
My eyes behold the woman I'm lookin for
It's you, you're the girl that I adore

Hey love
Hey love
Hey love

I see you early in the morning waitin for the bus
I can't really figure out if it's love or lust
When I see your face, light skin and fine
Nothin but a warm current shootin up my spine
Palms get all sweaty, a lump in my throat
Overcome by the urge to write you a note
I feel for you, so I reveal to you
If you were my queen I'd kneel to you
Do anything that you ask me to
But baby, there is a limit to what I'll do
For no female is worth goin to jail
And any man who disagree I said is weak as hell
Not tryin to diss, come off, or act ill
Baby, I'm just tellin you how I feel
For the fact remains that it's you my dear
When you make up your mind, love, I'll be here

Hey love
Hey love
Hey love

A mundane affair, oh yeah, my dear
Just a little sweet somethin we both can share
Can I have your number so I can use it?
I know what you're thinkin, baby, I won't lose it
But write it down and when I get home
I put your number on my speed calling phone
Then all I do is push number 2
Let the phone ring and then I ask for you
(Hello?) How you doin, love? (Sun?) Yeah, this is Sun
(You know Ron's here) Oh he is, huh?
(Yeah, but we can meet...) Well I call back later
The weekend's here, my money is right
There's somethin goin on at the club tonight
As I walk in the door suddenly it's you
Sittin all alone at a table for two
A walk to the bar, I begin to sweat
To get a bucket of ice, a bottle of MoÃ«t
Now I'm here, opposite your chair
As I pour you a drink I begin to think
About you and I, love, I wanna know why
You keep bringin up this other guy
You wanna be my girl, then quit wastin time
If he's out of your sight, then get him out of your mind
As I take your hand and we proceed to dance
The dancefloor is really packed
Although we both look cute wearin Fila suits
Everybody else is ( ? )
Now the party is over, we both are tired
But isn't it true just how time flies
Although we're beat let's get somethin to eat
Drive up to the pier and watch the sun rise

Hey love
Hey love
Hey love

I sit down to the desk in my room at my rest
While listening to WGFS
I address my letter to your college dorm
And begin with the help of the quiet storm
How should I approach, can't be too excessive
Not too shy, not too aggressive
I must be careful in how I word it
A poet of love, so introverted
See I am gonna write until I run out of ink
Until my fingers are sore, until my eyes turn pink
Just to let you know what I'm feelin
Wounded by love, now I need healin
Only you have the medicine
To cure this condition of love that I'm in
Love with a girl committed to another
You think that I'm wrong because your man is my brother

Hey love
Hey love
Hey love

Look sweetheart, I don't know what's wrong with you
You act like you want me but you don't wanna give this brother up
Everytime you hear about me and another girl you start riffin
And I'm not goin for that
Because it's not that time
You see
So what you gonna have to do is straighten up and fly right
And just bow out gracefully, love
But listen, I don't feel like talkin anymore
Why don't you just call me later
Peace

Hey love
