Into the nightmare, surrounded with evil 
I take flight
Devils they take me into a far place away
 
Into the nightmare, surrounded with evil 
I take flight
Devils they take me into a far place away
 
I see visions of creatures, crawl through the low
so I might fall
I tried to turn anyway
and gaze at the beauty I had known
 
The sun went down
He's lost the crown
The sun went down
He's lost the crown
 
"...and since much of our basic desires 
involve those things which are taboo or modified by moral precepts,
especially sexual desires and desires to commit hostile and violent acts,
we find that these things are not allowed to appear directly in our dreams!
Instead they are modified by regrouping, substitution, displacement, 
and other devices that disguise them."</pre>
