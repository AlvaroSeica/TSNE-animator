[Intro/Chorus: Ice-T]
EVIL DICK!!
Evil (DICK!!) ~ evil (DICK!!)
Evil (DICK!!) ~ evil (DICK!!)
Evil dick

[Verse One: Ice-T]
Evil dick likes warm and wet places
Evil dick don't care about faces
Evil dick likes, young tiny small spaces
Evil dick leaves little gooey telltale traces
Evil dick

[Chorus]

[Hook: Ice-T]
Late at night evil dick, he comes to me 
He says: don't sleep alone, don't sleep alone
Late at night evil dick, he wakes me up 
He says: "Don't sleep alone, don't sleep alone
Don't sleep alone, don't sleep alone, don't sleep aloooooooooone

[Chorus]

[Verse Three: Ice-T]
I had this girl, she said she loved me
Thought there was no one ever above me
She wanted to marry, and have my child
But evil dick, he had to get buckwild
Took me out one night; out with the freaks
If ever there was pussy, evil dick would seek
My girl caught me skeezing, she said I wasn't shit!
I said: "It wasn't me, baby, was that motherfucker evil dick!"

[Hook: Ice-T]
Late at night evil dick, he comes to me 
He says: don't sleep alone, don't sleep alone
Late at night evil dick, he wakes me up 
He says: "Don't sleep alone, don't sleep alone
Don't sleep alone, don't sleep alone, don't sleep aloooooooooone

[Chorus]

[Break: Ice-T displays the erotic characters of his dick]
And when evil dick has it's way, it sounds a little like this
AH, AH, AH, AH, OH, OH, OH, OH
COME HERE BABY, COME HERE BABY, AH, AH, AH, AH,
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, OH SHIT, OH, OH OH, OH... DAMN DICK!

[Chorus]

[Hook: Ice-T]
Late at night evil dick, he comes to me 
He says: don't sleep alone, don't sleep alone
Late at night evil dick, he wakes me up 
He says: "Don't sleep alone, don't sleep alone
Don't sleep alone, don't sleep alone, don't sleep aloooooooooone</pre>
