Mmm, yeah
Here we go
Hey baby.. don't you know what I can do to you?
Then again don't you know what I can do for you?
Check it out

[Chorus]
(I'll make you so, very happy)
Yeah, do you wanna be happy? (I wanna be happy)
Do you wanna feel good? (Yes I do)
Do you wanna be happy? (I wanna be happy)
Or do you wanna feel good? (Yes I do)
Do you wanna be happy? (I wanna be happy)
Or do you wanna feel good? (Yes I do)
Do you wanna be happy?
(I'll make you so, very happy)

[Markie Dee]
Let me see you smile..
Hey little girl take a hold of my hand
And let me tickle your G, until you can't withstand
It was once said, a brother like me couldn't whip ya
But daddy got deep, now your head's gonna trip
A real all true man, Markie Dee's the freak one
who stay in your back - shh - don't even speak hon
I know you wanted it from your first look at me

[Chorus]

[Markie Dee]
Aiyyo sugar, sexy, boo my sweet thing
Pappy slap me, make me happy
Jingle your earrings, and all that good stuff
Cause I'ma make you happy do you wanna call my bluff
And if you do, then step inside
Take me back to school and let your legs divide
I know what you want and what you're thinkin
And every other brother is dead and stinkin
And all up on your body I will be grippin
Cause if I didn't make you happy I would be slippin
So just ride, the merry go round and round
Then I pound, your body down to the ground
Just let me know, when you've had enough
So we can take a break and I can kiss your stuff
I know you wanted it from your first look at me

[Chorus]

[Markie Dee]
Here we go, breakdown..

(Yeah baby) Say love daddy baby, c'mon
(Love daddy!) Yeah..

Check it out (I'll make you so, very happy)
Ever since I was young I made the girlies drip
And if loving's a sin, me and the devil are kin
So would you like to ride on a, rough, rider?
And if you got a friend we can play inside her
I'm leavin girls with Kool-Aid smiles
I keep you occupied with different styles
Tell momma don't cook, cause tonight I'm gonna eat out
And I can keep the pace even when I pull the beat out
So come and get some of this scrumptious basty
mouth-waterin creamy pastry
And you can have it when you want it with ease
Just call me up and say daddy please
You run and tell your friends to try this here
Cause you know that I can leave 'em with a smile and a tear
I know you wanted it from your first look at me

[Chorus]

[Markie Dee]
Yeah, c'mon baby
Let's head on back to my room
Yeah
C'mon you know you want it just as bad as I do
Cause I know, that you know, that I know, that you know
(I'll make you so, very happy)
Yeah
Let's head on back to my room baby
C'mon
Cause I know, that you know, that you know, that I know
(I'll make you so, very happy)
Yeah</pre>
