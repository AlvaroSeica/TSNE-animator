Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Yeah
Another love song gone wrong
So know you are a WOOP
Like based God in wonton
But I didn't
And I ain't even tripping
Another foul ball
But I'm still glad I hit it
'Cause a lot of niggas didn't, you know
Coulda shoulda type like,
"Oh, it was like, too tight"
Come on, I would've pipe
But our schedules contradicted
Well I was tied down hey pipe down
First night ya boy laid the pipe down
Took off the night gown
And whipped out the slanky
Then she screamed, "Joey spank me"
And after that she even thanked me, swanky
One time for my nigga Dymes
Lord knows we'll be kicking rhymes
'Til the end of time
But back to the topic
Oh yeah I'm pissed off
I'm still tripped off
And wondering why shorty dipped off
I ain't gonna front a nigga
Do miss the lip gloss
Now she sucked some next nigga dick off
And my dick soft
So tell me what the fuck I'm posed to do
And you know it ain't too easy getting over you
I sent the postcards so you know it's true
I promise that I wouldn't get emotional
And I'm not, so stop it
Why you frontin like you don't miss my whole cock
Pit down your esophagus
Screaming, "daddy stop it"
Ripping out your tracks
Chipped nail polish in the scratches of my back like
Did you forget about the time we had the sticky roll
And I tried to suck your titties whole
For milk for my cheerios
Did you forget about the video when you first came
I hit that spot twice and since then
You haven't been the same
Now I heard you fucking with some new man
Can't remember his name
But my first impression: what a lame
Lorraine said she seen him at a bowling lane
Walking out the bathroom kinda strange with a shoulder stain
Faggot
Six months, and I'm still at it
You probably never hear this track
But I still rap it
I guess I'm still attracted to you being here
I swear I can't imagine you to not even care
Whole thing played out like magic and it's kinda weird
It's like I did a trick and you won't be reappear
It ain't fair, I need you back sometimes I get scared
But I'm a player, ain't gonna let you see my tears
'Cause I'm a player, ain't gonna let you see my tears
'Cause I'm a player, ain't gonna let you see my tears
'Cause I'm a player, ain't gonna let you see my tears
'Cause I'm a player
I couldn't see it coming down my eyes
So I had to make the song cry cry
I couldn't see it coming down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
I couldn't see it coming down my eyes
So I had to make the song cry cry
I couldn't see it coming down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
