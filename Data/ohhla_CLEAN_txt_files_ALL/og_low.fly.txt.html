[Ese Rich Roc]
Yeah, that O.G. lowrider's a little higher

(Verse 1)
Like a rock
I'm rollin'
Goin' to the barrio
The area that's scaring ya
And you don't wanna go
To the wrong side of the tracks at the wrong time
Draggin' to the hood, I see some homies of mine
Gettin'
Fucked up
And kicking it hard
And then I drive up slow
In my (???) car
Turn up
The firme
Rola
My O.G. song
Notice some socas that don't belong
Tell all my homies and we jump
Inside the ride
Cause these vatos can run
But they can't hide
But the (???) on ask a thing, I didn't blast
Pero
One had pleto, so I stuck him with my filero
Jump, back in, cruise slow and slower
Flip, the hydrolics
Drop it to the floor

Refrain: Ese Rich Roc
That's just to show you not to fuck with me, man
Ask all the vatos in the H.A., they know who I am

[Ese Rich Roc]
"All, my, friends
Knows the lowrider
The low-ri-der
Lives a little higher" --&gt; War

(Verse 2)
Heinas stare
As I roll by
Rukas scream, to jump, into the ride
But by now, there's too many, it's a car low
Pick, up many rukas from the streets I roll through
I'm not a
Fool, I know what to do
Bitches, come on in, as long as I get into you
To fuck, that, teasin'
I know the only reason
You jump into the ride, that's for you to be seen inside
But that's alright
I'll have my fun tonight
Only reason I'll let you in is cause your pussy's still tight
They use me, I use them
I don't think, nothin' of it
And the heinas don't, care because my, car, they love it
That's how it goes
That's how it is, see
You wanna find out for yourself, you don't believe me, then

Break: Ese Rich Roc
"Take a little trip
Take a little trip
Take a little trip
And see
Take a little trip
Take a little trip
Take a little trip
With me" --&gt; War

(Verse 3)
Crossroads, roll as I drive
To be a lowrider, shit, it's hard to survive
You got these rapas tryin' to jack
Tryin' to get the payback
And everytime I look behind my shoulder, there's a jura
Pulling me over
To the side, mato my ride, I don't know
Maybe it's because I'm a hardcore cholo
Or because my car's too low
I drive too slow
And I drink too much Cisco
Always on the run
But never driving fast
Always pulling slow
Down to kick, some ass, and blast
Down a fool, who keeps
Slippin' and trippin'
Pull the cuete from under the seat
And the trigger, I'll be clickin'

Repeat Refrain

[Ese Rich Roc]
"All, my, friends
Knows the lowrider
Low-ri-der
Drives a little slower" --&gt; War</pre>
