[Wiz Khalifa - Verse 1]
The world turnin, the weed burnin
Them haters talkin, I keep earnin
Know some who say lifes a bitch
Well I'ma keep flirtin 
And fuck that bitch for the money and Louie V purchases
Old folks jock my car cause they know just what this is
Niggaz flexin' hard with no bars, they got weak servants
Keep verses, Mortal Kombat
Look at my ring, if I aint ballin' bitch then what you call that
Nothin but net, ain't back cause I never left
I did everythin right nigga better yet
Roll a blunt for the niggaz thats around us
Somethin like a contractor buildin from the ground up
Now just (Ooooooh)
Twist up this weed
Realise that you in the presence of a G
Don't fuck up my paper meanin my cheese
Or the ones I use to roll up my trees
Fuck it, you know what I mean

[Chorus]
I'm riding round, smoking, my music aloud
Kinda do my thing, no disrespect to the niggas before me
Some smile up in your face but then they on the low
Now I just stunt on my own
Now I just stunt on my own
I'm in a race, and taking the winners place
No foot on the brakes
One of the best, homie thats what they call me
It's lonely at the top, aint no company so
Now I just stunt on my own
Now I just stunt on my own

[Wiz Khalifa - Verse 2]
See me, when I'm alone, wishin they could fuck with me
My ex calling my phone, wishin she could stunt with me
But I'm just riding dog, doing a buck fifty
Stunting like Jet Li, boat houses and Jet Ski's
Thirty on the flight, ice like the Gretsky's
My dime pieces only recognize the best tree's
Treat em like I don't need em boy, you best believe
You in her face, I let her breath (Ooooooh)
From debated on, to waited on
From hated on, to the nigga they put they cake up on
Cause we are, Young Movie stars
Cause we are, Young Movie stars

[Chorus]

(Ooooooh, oooh, ooo-oo-oooooh)
(Ooooooh, oooh, ooo-oo-oooooh)
(Ooooooh, oooh, ooo-oo-oooooh)

[Wiz Khalifa - Verse 3]
O-ooo-oh, now I just stunt on my own
Bitches aint say shit to me but now they won't leave me alone
Used to walk the other way
But now they all come to my home
And they callin my phone, cause my paper was looong
Nothin, they aint singin my song
Get hired up, if they want than I bring them along
We flyin up, now you want me to take it all off
Me to take it all off
Tell a bitch I'ma ball and I'ma buy a new crib for my niggaz and all
Cause I remember days we'd sit and picture it all
Nigga swear I'd leave or pictured I'd fall
Countin reasons why they hate, your bitch think I'm a star
Cause we are, young, gifted, not to mention out here makin muthaf-ckin millions
Yeah, I said it, muthafuckin millions
Got my money up, I'm in the building

[Chorus]</pre>
