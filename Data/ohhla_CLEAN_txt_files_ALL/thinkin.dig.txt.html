Song:   Thinkin' Bout U
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Uh yeah, uh uh, uh uh, uh, yeah
But girl I gotta let u know...that

[Chorus]
I know we're apart but, u still got my heart and (I gotta know)
Do you ever think about me
No I don't deserve this
What we had was perfect, (just want you to know girl)
That I'll always think about you

Hey miss anonymous
Lately I've been reminiscin
On all our kisses and what we had im kinda missin
It got me trippin' cuz everything just feels so different
And every time I'm in the heights I gotta' a nigga' thinking
What if she better off with out me just running abroad
That she's gotta a new man just waiting up under my car
Can't figure it out but I know I gave you my all
Funny how you took it for granted and then just call it off
The cherry red flowers them late night hours
When I would god bless the way I felt towards you I thought the world was ours
Well I guess I was mistaken, because when I was in Vegas
I got a call when you were sayin that u couldn't take it, (what yeah)
You said it was just too much
Girl what you think this was a crush, (nah)
I wasn't even in a rush
But the way you had me feeling I thought you were thinking bout us

[Chorus]

Everything seems so perfect
Almost like a dream
I guess the nightmare been disguises all that you can see
But through the eyes of everyone around as well as me
Know that our chemistry incredibly made us complete
So when it went down I was at a lose for words
Couldn't take it
Everything that I just heard
And anything that happened between us was now a blur
Cuz only last week we were good then that occurred
So unexpected your behavior didn't reflect it
Felt disconnected
Something between us in a second
All the affection gone
What happened to the blessing we had together for so long
You and I perfected
I bet to u it didn't mean a lot
I mean I know u said it did but rite on the spot
You went a bent me from your life like a boycott
Well just imagine how much hurt this boy got

[Chorus]

[2x]
Late night
Just putting up a fight
With my feelings when I know it ain't rite
Ain't never had this much strength in my life
But baby I can't stop
Think about you

Yeah, yeah, yeah</pre>
