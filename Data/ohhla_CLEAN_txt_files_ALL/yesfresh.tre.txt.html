[Intro]
I'ma just get right to it
(DJ Finesse)
Feelin like a million; a trillion
Bills and um...
Na I'ma just, wait 'til it drop
Aight, let's go
Uhhh

[Trey Songz]
Feelin like a million, trillion, bills and I'm
revealin all this jewelry, chickens wanna cock-a-doodle me
Wouldn't that be cool to me, let 'em think they schoolin me
They get no besides usin they brains, lack of tutoring

[Chorus]
Yes I'm, fresh um, leanin to the left um
Liquor on my breath, bitches singin to the left to the left
Do your step, do your step
I'm drunk, but I can drive myself

[Fynch Money Baggz]
And I'm a VA nigga, drankin all the bottles at the bar
You can tell I'm a star, shorty saw me hoppin out the drop
26's my nigga, ridin high smokin
Well my weed come in a jar, leepin it hood my nigga
Drinkin my lean out the bottle, gotta have a pocket full of money
Just to be at my car do', and I ain't thinkin bout a hater
Cause the pump in the car do' I'll leave you slump in your car low
Throw them deuces my nigga, they gon' have to catch me tomorrow
If I come and they follow, I'll be gunnin the throttle
Fo'-five on my side when they come with the hollows
All the ladies they love me they like the way I be leanin
Geeked up treed up and I'm promethazinin - Money

[Chorus] - 3X
