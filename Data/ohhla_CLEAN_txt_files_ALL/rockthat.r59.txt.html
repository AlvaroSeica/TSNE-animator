[Chorus: repeat 2X]
I, can't, feel you; I want you to {"ROCK THAT"} shit

{"ROCK THAT"} shit {"ROCK THAT"} shit
{"RO-RO-RO-RO-RO-RO-RO-RO.."}

[Royce Da 5'9"]
Ooh~! Put up your hands, show me the real you
If you don't put your hands up then I'ma kill you
You ain't never been touched homie, I can't feel you
I don't listen to threats, nigga I can't hear you (hello?)

[Kid Vishis]
Put up your hands, show me the real you
You don't put your hands up, I'ma kill you
I'm the shit fool, it's the king prince too
I'm the next shit from the I'm Da Shit crew, ooh

[Royce Da 5'9"]
Nigga get cool, "You're my boy Blue!
Blue, you're my boy!" I'll Chicago, Illinois you

[Kid Vishis]
Nigga we'll destroy you
It's a motherfuckin wrap when it come to that heat like aluminum foil

[Chorus]

[Royce Da 5'9"]
Idolize 'em, not a lot of 'em, body by them
There's a bottle by the fags, she should try to follow 
the man with the rocks, rocky as Colorado standin on top of them
Toppin top the opposition, I ain't quittin 'til Vishis in my position
I drop this apocalyptic, you got to be optimistic
I'm hot hot hot

[Kid Vishis]
Let's try this shit again
Vishis the prince, the topic of the spit
This cop nowhere near it, I'm in a win-win position (yes)
Could send killers to knock-knock (who is it?)
Hard in pot, fall by the end of the visit (yes)
No henchmen

[Royce Da 5'9"]
Six shots the biscuit
Smackin on his back like I'm burpin a infant
Then nigga put up your hands, show me the real you
Put money on your head and then I'ma bill YOU
Take it out yo' ass in hell, I'm on a ratchet trail
And you about to see the gat derail!

[Chorus]

[Kid Vishis]
Yeah, Vishis and Nickel equipped with pistols
Missiles'll hit your tissue {?} show you and STAY, like Mystikal
Clip to whoever riddle, my mental see you and scratch
You tryin to scrap to cover up the fact you can't rap

[Royce Da 5'9"]
I, can't, feel you; I want you to {"ROCK THAT"}
Glock that, pop that, shock that
Down to click twos, I'ma spit true
Dominant crew, I'm the SHIT fool~!
Ooh~!

[Kid Vishis]
Put the clip to a actor, CUT!
You motherfuckers up when it's action, nigga what?
We don't fight rappers, we write back at ya
Black mac blap, niggaz back snap backwards
Ooh~!

[Royce Da 5'9"]
Actors, act puss, blow 'em off the atlas
Fear niggaz should fear, on point like a cactus
You probably need to practice, that's it, backflip
Word blacksmith, herb active DOPE~!

[Chorus]

Ooh~!</pre>
