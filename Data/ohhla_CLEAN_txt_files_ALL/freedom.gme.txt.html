Holdin my daughter in the booth
Her momma out there somewhere in that Bentley tryin to find a roof
Poof, I wave my wand and here comes Kendrick
Niggaz say the West ain't winnin, I'm just tryin to find the proof
Speakin of Proof I'm 'bout to roll one with Snoop
Blow the smoke out to your memory and toast to Eminem cause he
gave me the shit that I needed on "Documentary"
Keep it real with myself, I got murdered like John Kennedy
But that was cool cause I was just there for the energy
Watchin Bizarre pop pills while 2Pac in my Hennessy
First time in Detroit, had to rock the Grant Hills
Cause I threw up my dukes when California was at a stand still
But hope ain't lost cause, Dr. Dre the man still
Had faith in me, knew I had heat, like an anvil
Ran through entire crews, put their remains in a landfill
And I ain't lost the hunger, I'm eatin out the can still
Yeah, wherever Hov' and Nas at in the world right now
I know they listenin like
This young nigga be killin this shit
Hip-hop is life's CÃ®roc, I'm 'bout to drop a pill in this shit
Let's go, +Esco-bars+ nigga, like Nas nigga
The flow is Rakim with the Birdman cars nigga
Hold on I gotta take Birdman's call nigga

[Interlude: Game]
Stunna, what up Blood?
("What up Blood? What's poppin my nigga?
  Look, I know this the last one
  After this it's straight Cash Money my nigga
  So, it's YMCMB, wild life nigga, let's get it poppin")
Rich game
("All the time, one hunnid")
Soo-Woo

[Game]
New coupe, remove roof
I'm from where niggaz'll do your bitch and bitch niggaz'll do you
Inevitably we take celebrity bitches and run a choo-choo
We puttin on Magnums, taggin that wagon, some of these birds cuckoo
And murder is what I do to these Just Blazes, Kanyes
Shit on Swizz, I handle my biz, the whole world know what I do to Dre's shit
Niggaz know I'm classic, I ain't even gotta say shit
Frank Ocean more of a man than you niggaz, get up off that gay shit
Fuck copyin styles, niggaz be tracin
Whether it's me, the movie or Jadakiss, niggaz just can't fuck with Jayceon/Jason
Let's go

[Chorus: Elijah Blake]
Lahhhhh, dah dah da-dah dahhhh, ah
Thought you loved me before
I'm glad to kill it some more
Every hood needs an anthem
Lahhhhh, dah dah da-dah dahhhh, ahh
Winning comes with a price
No matter how hard you try
Can't buy freedom
We're farrrrrrrrr from being free
Yeah we're farrrrrrrrr from being free
We're far from freedom

[Game]
Wanna welcome everybody to "Jesus Piece"
After my album fades my competition will lyrically be deceased
Niggaz sayin I'm underrated
Like a younger Jay with +Heat+ but not the ones the Thunder play with
So Los Angeles King is sort of an understatement
Let me find a gun to play with I'll leave you niggaz under pavement
Tell 'em they rent's due, pay up or get cement shoes
All this dope be around, you actin like I ain't lean on that fence too
But now you up here and bitches and cars is what I'm into
You wanna send me to God, I wear 45 in that French shoe
I fuck with Wale, Ross, and my nigga French too
And me and 'Face just slashed the last beat up like a ginsu
My album like a 'rari, a lot of dope features
Glad you bought it, now sit back and just blow reefer
I know the concept behind it is gon' reach ya
Now turn this muh'fucker up and blow speakers

Ladies and gentleman
I would like to introduce to you
An incredible gentleman
He goes by the name Elijah Blake
Let's go

[Chorus]

[Outro: Game]
And last but definitely not least
I wanna send a special shout out, to my nigga James Harden
Another Los Angeles nigga carryin them Rockets
Ballin on you bitches</pre>
