[Bridge]
This, love is chemical 
E-lectic particle
Down, to the minimal 
Tickle tickle, ego stroke
I, love your follcles
I, know you've heard it all
You, know that I am skilled
in just, how you want to feel
Ooh! Uh-oh! Dropped your knot
Scoop it up, put it in my sock (uh)
I'll, be your robot girl
Come, in to meet my world
(I want you baaaaad...) - Ooh-whee, boy lemme drive your car
I am a predator, hey
'Cause munny I want you bad, la-la, la-la

[Chorus 2X]
