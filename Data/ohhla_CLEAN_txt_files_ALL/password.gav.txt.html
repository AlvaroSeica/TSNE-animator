[Chorus]
I don't think they want it homie
I don't think they want it holmesâ¨I don't think they want it homie
I don't think they want it bro
I don't think they want it homie
I don't think they want it holmesâ¨I don't think they want it homie
I don't think they want it bro

[Verse]
It's Sir heVy but you could tell by flow
Grammatically armed, set, strapped ready to go
I'm repping for my city, 'cuz Brooklyn on my back
And my street still gritty, just watch how I reactâ¨I'm in it 'til the end of it, rather durable
This verse diagnosed with aids, it's incurable
Sick with the stanzaz, dancing with the rhythms
Sounds like I'm hopscotching, two stepping or fox trotting
Coming for that 1 spot 'cuz these other dudes sweater than kumquatâ¨Still referring back to time when they was hot
Fam I do doubt it. Yup, we too rowdy
Yup, you could count it if I'm shooting to win
They shot once, but I doubt they'll be shooting againâ¨I'm on a mission and really cant settle for less
Neverapped2bcool bro ... the best

[Chorus (2x)]
I don't think they want it homie
I don't think they want it holmesâ¨I don't think they want it homie
I don't think they want it bro
I don't think they want it homie
I don't think they want it holmesâ¨I don't think they want it homie
I don't think they want it bro</pre>
