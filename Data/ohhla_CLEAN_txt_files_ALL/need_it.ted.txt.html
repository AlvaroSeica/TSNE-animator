Dont get confused baby
Dont get confused (x4)

Verse 1: Tedashii

The gospel got me so good, I call it super straight
Was lame till He came, I know that you relate
Was dead to Him but lead to Him, He rejuvenates
Still cant believe me call me up, yea elevate
That's how I know He got me, His love is never endin'
And thats just like the Gospel which for sure is never pending
Not just from my beginning, gets me until im finished
Takes me way beyond the grave. I'm saved, eternal livin'

This goes beyond conversion, this gift just keeps on giving
It makes no sense to start and stop. Now pop that clutch and shift it'
I'm hoping you don't miss it, this here is target practice.
I'm asking, "What good are Beats By Dre if you can't grasp this?"
(Hah, uh-uh) That aint even right man
Way into the left of lust, mental pics, tight frame
You crop it like a close-up, then chop it like the chorus
I'm tryna take you deep, call it Blacklight, mayne

Chorus:
Aye it's that good news music
We call it Gospel (x3)
Don't get confused, baby
Its what He used to save me
It's what He used to keep me
I need I daily, you need it daily, we need it daily, they need it (x2)

Verse 2: PRo

Boy let's get it clear, from the Lord's wrath I'm saved
Yeah I'm Gucci Mane, no Waka Flocka Flame
So secure in the Lord, no frontin' for people
You die stuntin', Evil Kenevil
In this New Jack City hold the world loosely
His Word keep callin' me, I'm itchin for it, call me Pookie
Satan try to trap us like "Go pursue sin"
I'm like "Silly rabbit, Trixs are for kids."
I know only in Christ we gon' be free
Through His blood we've been redeemed
Them chains no longer holdin' me (Soooo)
Clique for the squad, for the love of God, boy we rollin' 40 Deep (and)
We the one that want a love for the son through the Helper, get a hold of me (see)
Christ died for us, we'll say He's a church fan
I'm talkin' Gospel, minus the church fan
I'd be a fool minus the Lord's hand
So I'm wrapped around His finger like a wedding band

Bridge:

I'm good, I'm good
Let's get that understood
The Gospel got me right for life, that's right that's what it do
I'm good, I'm good
Let's get that understood
The Gospel got me right for life, that's right that's what it do

I'm good, I'm gucci. Aye, yeah that's what it do (x2)</pre>
