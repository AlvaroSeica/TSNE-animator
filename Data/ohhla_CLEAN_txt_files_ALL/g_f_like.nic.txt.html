These girls fall like dominoes (dominoes)
These girls fall like dominoes (da-da-Dominoes)
These girls fall like dominoes (dominoes)
These girls fall like dominoes (d-d-Dominoes)(dominoes) (d-d-dominoes)

(Verse 1)
Yo, Ayo, Ayo
I'ma need 69 real bad girls for my tour bus
Somebody get security to escort us
They go the long way, but we take the shortcuts
Gimme the blonde hair, long weave, short cuts
You know the flow sick came in on the small bus
So get the d-cups c-cups small bust
They judge me like the girls on trial
But every time that I come out it's just girls gone wild
Got the domino affect, in the front row passing out
With little bikini tops, they got they X's hanging out
Say my shoe game nuts, so I call em cashews
Every other city is a Nicki tatoo
Steal Wayne girls, I steal Drake girls
You kno da real bitches, let me fuck da fake girls
So if you pretty I sign titties
I got da key to eight muthafuckin cities

These girls fall like dominoes (dominoes)
These girls fall like dominoes (da-da-Dominoes)
These girls fall like dominoes (dominoes)
These girls fall like dominoes (d-d-Dominoes)(dominoes) (d-d-Dominoes)

(Verse 2)
Okay so wen I'm in da hills I hang with Kristen Kavaleri
And wen I'm in Miami I'm with Kourtney, Kim, and Khloe
And wen I'm in the A I'm with Ciara or it's Keri
I'm feeling like a diva then I hit Mariah Carey
I'm in the UK I'ma see M.I.A.
Super hero by night, Ra Ra rapper by day
And if I just wanna talk ima hit up Monique
If I need a bad bitch... Angeline Jolie
Material girls like Madonna, model for Donatella
Ain't nothing you can tell her cuz she get da mozzarella
She look just like Rihanna, she work with Wilhelmina
Only rock Galliano, she might be Filipino
Be sippin' Pellegrino, be watchin' Al Pacino
She could prolly sniff a kilo, any way yo
Hit up Grace Jones and tell her I said strange
I'm out in Paris muthafucka wit Beyonce'

These girls fall like dominoes (dominoes)
These girls fall like dominoes (da-da-Dominoes)
These girls fall like dominoes (dominoes)
These girls fall like dominoes (d-d-Dominoes)(dominoes) (d-d-dominoes)

Girls Girls Everyday, from London, Canada and the USA
Girls Girls Everyday, from London, Canada and the USA
Girls Girls Everyday, from London, Canada and the USA
Girls Girls Everyday, from London, Canada and the USA
Where my westside girls at, and where my eastside girls at
Yo where my northside girls at and where my down south girls at
Yo where my westside girls at, and where my eastside girls at
Where my up north girls at, now where my down south girls at

These girls fall like dominoes (dominoes)
These girls fall like dominoes (da-da-Dominoes)
These girls fall like dominoes (dominoes)
These girls fall like dominoes (d-d-Dominoes)(dominoes)(d-d-dominoes)</pre>
