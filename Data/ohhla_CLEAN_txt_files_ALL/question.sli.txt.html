Typed by: AZ Lyrics

You say where are we going
And what you gonna do
When all those police men
Come chasin after you
You better run away
Keep yourself from day
Hide out in the night
They leave you without any right

I don't know why they are coming to take you away
If you had reasoned
They'd call it treason
And blow your sorry ass away

You say where are we going
And what you gonna do
When all those police men
Come chasin after you
You better run away
Get out while you still can
There's blood in your eyes
You're not a mortal man</pre>
