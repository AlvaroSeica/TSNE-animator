Y'all niggaz, can't fuck with my niggaz hoe - 4x
Motherfuck that nigga, (motherfuck that bitch)
Motherfuck that nigga, (motherfuck that bitch)
Motherfuck that nigga, (motherfuck that bitch)
SES the shit, you can't fuck with my click

[Carmen Sandiego]
My bitches be rolling on dubs, big bodies we got that
These jackers try to get with it, my gat I cock back
Now bust back, I hate to be the reason you gone
I'm a bitch with anger problems, piss me off you so gone
Now run home, see mama cause I ain't got time to play
You fucking with SES, you done picked the wrong day
Cause lately, my patience ain't what it use to be
These hoe games you bitches playing, done got the best of me
But not now, like Ray I'ma make you do what it do
Carmen San' a gangsta bitch, now who the fuck are you
I stay down with my niggaz E.S.G., Sin and Stacks
And got drama for a bitch, if she got a problem with that
Now where you at hoe, now where you at hoe
Don't make me blow a fucking hole, in your back hoe
It's like that bitch, it's like that bitch
I took your nigga fucked him down, cause I'm a bad bitch

[Hook]

[Brandon Stacks]
Now what's the fucking problem, why these bitch niggaz ain't moving
Guess they won't get the picture, till they see they blood oozing
See I love this rap shit, but I love that beef shit mo'
You get X'd out with mo' X's, than tic-tac-toe
Oh you ain't know who you fucking with, it's SES bitch
Let the fans be the judge, who the number one draft picks
You don't want no street shit, knock one out and ask who's next
Then shoot a innocent bystander, for throwing up his set
First you lose your chain, then you lose your watch next
And this here, cause you bitch niggaz wanted plex
I see you, fighting for your life all night
Wife and kids praying, knowing your future don't look bright
We drag niggaz out the club, and let the laws sort em out
Same night we chilling smoking, don't even know what it was about
Cause when you fucking with my click, you done crossed the line
Lost your mind, now you looking sloppy lost your grind bitch nigga

[Hook]

[E.S.G.]
Niggaz I ain't seen in a minute, still running they mouth
They ain't seen what I'm driving, they ain't seen my house
Fuck this ice in my mouth, I'm a C.E.O.
Politic'ing in New York, trying to get mo' do'
You know two hundred G's I'm stashing that, bent like free I'm mashing that
(and why you ain't sign with Slim Thug), stop asking that
No plex with it, or less respect with it
And start dragging have my check, it's gon be less digits
Yup niggaz still hate from back in the day, deadly combo like Shaq and Wade
On the street y'all acting hard, behind the bars y'all acting gay
Ask them labels majors say, yep I bring a lot of fire
Grown man amongst boys, this a younger Stoudemire
And I ain't talking bout Damon, I mean Amare
Thought I wouldn't bounce back, bitch niggaz sorry
V-I-C-T-O-R-Y
Y'all can't have it, na-na-na-na-na

[Hook]

[Swiftface]
Real life type, fuck the hype type
Get the do' and go, I slick the shife type
Living my life, running red lights
Selling blow you ain't know, stay out the FED's sight
Cut the check nigga, nothing less nigga
Diamonds is still relentless, what you expect nigga
They say the streets heated, I'm what the streets needed
Got a hunger for this hustle, shit then let me feed it
They dranked out and weeded, and bitches been depleted
But miss me with that show shit, I high speeded
I want it all nigga, it's time to ball nigga
Ain't a Muslim but trust him, the final call nigga
This is for my dog niggaz, I'm back to hog with ya
If I squeeze seventeen, I mean they all hit ya
In a dead rush, to get your head bust
SES don't plex, they can't fuck with us

[Hook]

(*talking*)
Know I'm saying, that's what we talking bout baby
E.S. motherfucking G, that;s my nigga Brandon Stacks
Carmen Sandiego, Swiftface that's right
What's up Sin, this SES know I'm saying H-Town
This how we doing it oh yeah, All American Gangsta
In your motherfucking sto', you ain't got it get it
You square ass niggaz, it's going down for this 0-5 SES</pre>
