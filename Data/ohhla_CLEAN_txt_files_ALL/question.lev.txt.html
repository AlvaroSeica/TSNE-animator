[Intro]
Here we come again. Know what I'm sayin'? Got a question to ask
Ha. What's up that? Um, what's up with that ass?

[Verse One] [Bambino]
Well it's the player in the ? all the hoes be on my nob
Squab if I have to see, but I got a rep to be 
Chilled out with Mary Jane, gear geared out the game
More people know my name, but everything's the same
Bambino the adolescent
Punanny pokin'  
Do you get the dick?
Cause she was wide open
Put a check in the box if I rock
Leave it blank if I spank
You hop on my jock for the props I say thanks
Cause the chronic
Couldn't have done it without ya
I'm the one to hit the skins cause there's just somethin' about ya
I bone so I get roasted if my gear is repeated
I know it's kinda sad, I'm a tad bit conceited
I let loose my frustrations
Then blaze a blunt for the relaxation
Foes keep poppin', got hoes that don't stop
Cause it's loot clockin', boot knockin', who's stoppin' me though?
Not Vanilla but I'm Ice Ice nice nice
I roll with Stenge but pas the mic to Ced Twice twice

[Ced Twice]
It's the fresh cut baldy
?
Hit me on my box hops, don't call me
I come clean cause I rubba dubba
I hit ya mother
The cool brother from Anotha (Level)
I'm on point
Sharp like a syringe
For phat beats I binge
Pull hoes with Stenge
And Bam
Niggas wanna shake my hand
Honey's choosin' me
Even one's that got a man
Arivaderchi so I'm out
Back in with an Hola
Niggas hear me flow went back and said, "Oh my
God. Style's kinda odd but it's nice."
Twice, the mellow
Hello to the honeys
Now I'm makin' ends everything I say is funny
Laugh, laugh I got lots of cash
But after the show hoe, what's up with that ass?
(Yeah what's up with it?)
What's up with that ass?
(We got a question to ask)
(Ayo what's up with that ass?)

[Stenge]
Well it's that dope rhymer writer
I wrote this rhyme on Provida 
I da be the dopest rapper 
I da hope/Idaho, not the state
Stayin' geared up and down like a mannequin
I steps on the scene
And niggas started panicin'
Cause they know my shit's terrific
Cause +Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of These)+ like Eurhythmics
The one and only
Never lonely
You can peep me but don't you'll get owned
Not boastin' or braggin' 
Big star saggin'
No I'm not taggin'
That's what I did in junior high no lie
Hangin' off buses
Kickin' up dust and 
Tell the girls ? 
And down with the panties
Niggas can't stand me
I'm only 19 and I'm new on the scene so what's up with that fanny?

[Bambino]
Well as I freak this 
You freak with the funky fly freakiest
Flow with the A.L.
But not the squeaky kid
The one rough rookie, who's one tough cookie
Never pussy whipped cause I whip that pussy
Lookie here
40 hoes and beers
40 O's of beers
'94 is the year

[Ced Twice]
I'm Polo booted
Hugo Boss suited
Tag Heuer on my wrist
Pockets fat and looted
When it comes to honeys, I roll with the team
If one starts trippin'
I can always call Janine
(The dick fiend!)
So what's up with the seeeeeexxxxx
Let me take you to Anotha Leeeeeev
You know the question I'm askin'
When can I get to smashin'?
What's up with that ass in?
I mean it can't get no plainer
Roll the Mary Jane up, prepare for the reign of
The player
Fly girl layer
You know I got (aaaaaah) flava
+What's That Cha Say+
From the west
L.A.
A.L.
Is what I'm on
Peace out Twice is gone

[Outro]
What's up with that aaaaaaaaaaaassssssss?
Tell me what's up with that ass? Tell me what's up with that ass?
Cut the small talk tell me what's up with that ass? </pre>
