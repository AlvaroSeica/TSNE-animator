Now the streets I run
Is the streets I'm from
And the streets you run
Is the streets you from
And this is for the borough

Verse 1:
I roam in the jungle and rumble with thugs and hoods that rob for goods
Weed smokers and murderers and relations
My daily operation caucasions hit me wit persuasions
Be all you can be, fuck that
Be on the block, sell rocks, stay strapped
Ready to cock back and blast for my respect
Never neglect and watch out for my Tech
I got trouble, mad trouble
I drink too much, that's when I don't give a fuck who I buck
I get sideways and take it to the highways
Killin' liars twistin' niggers like pliars
Day to day strugglein' jugglein'
Wonderin' where the next meal comin from
Never happen, nay mean
I'm playin' for keeps that means I'm keepin' my cream

We play for keeps
Me and my peeps we run these streets
We play for keeps
Don't sleep when we creep
Lose your head piece chief
Bring beef lose teeth
We play for keeps      x2

Verse 2:
Brand new apparrel on my ass on the regular
Skypager new ride equipped wit a cellular
Big ass piece of the pie till I die
Play for keeps no lie, wonderin' why
Niggas aint got no opportunity
Niggas aint got no fuckin unity
Every man for himself and kill a man wit the ball
Drink a little Hennesy and go A-wall
Fuck the bullshit, glock shots spit where I rest at
Got me asking niggers where you buy that vest at
Leave my front door like I'm ready for war
I'm ready to die sometimes, I can't take it no more
My mantality is twisted
I'm forever blunted forever wishin' to get lifted and splifted
I love these streets
That's why a nigga like Nine play for keeps

We play for keeps
Me and my peeps we run these streets
We play for keeps
Don't sleep when we creep
Lose your head piece chief
Bring beef lose teeth
We play for keeps      x2

Verse 3:
Dark mass forever until the day I'm gone
I'm gonna put in on my people
Save it for the sequel, the root of all evil
Is fillin' up my pocket makin' me lethal
Only the good die young so I'm bad as fuck
Pass the buck and be shit out of luck
Niggas know the routine, we got it down pat
You ain't getting jack if your pocket ain't fat
So phat out the realness, you could feel this
Goin' insane me can't deal wit diss
I'm under pressure
The ghetto got my mind in a daze
Duckin' strays, knowin' that crime pays
Always and forever picture perfect
Not the Mona Lisa, cuttin' up niggas like pizza
In slices devices of war make me hardcore
Over rough beats I play for keeps

We play for keeps
Me and my peeps we run these streets
We play for keeps
Don't sleep when we creep
Lose your head piece chief
Bring beef lose teeth
We play for keeps     x2</pre>
