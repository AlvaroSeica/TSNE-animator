Faded
FafafafaFaded
Faded, Boss Cost: paid it
Red Eyes, no Visine, pupils dilated
Money I'm creating, Hoe's I'm replacing
Got the bitch shocked but I ain't do no tazing
But this the news that I get prescripted to
Your girl with me, then she getting lifted too
Got a good head, she mentally gifted too
She love the same dick I keep giving to you
Dont come with that bullshit, I'm already balling
And I pass it off, you can say I'm Chris Pauling
My money growing, yours jackson balding
I get the pass but I ain't Kevin Spaldings
I'm a student smoking blunts long as rulers
If she got some good brains then you know I need a tudor
Lil Marley Mean but the john* even ruder
All these hoes wanna kick it I must be the scooter

I'm Faded
Hook

My eyes low but I keep 'em on the rise
I'm buzzing in the air, look nigga I am that fly
I'm up in the sky and you nigga on my shitlist
And yall ain't fuck nothing, you nigga ridiculous
And I go deep nigga you just need to vomit
JBM in the building nigga you know that we run it
Why you fronting?
Where your hoes nigga?
And I ain't talking clothes and
You nigga be acting and this is not a show
So play your role or get cut
I'm a dog you're a mut and
You nigga ain't running, you just running out of luck and
yeah we be shooting, so nigga you better duck and
Cuff your head, I'm about my bread
Life on the edge
Play with my bread, you will be dead with a bullet through your head
No tears should be shed
Yeah I'm with my nigga and you would fall off a ledge nigga
Ankle farther than your head

I'm Faded
Hook

I get my coffee, then I hit the block
You're a lil bit of a drinker, I drink a lot
Ecstasy in my pockets, on my teeth: rocks
Heroin lookouts on the corner, I got it locked
Big short, Small package, Medium Shirt
Hip Hop, Miss the wake or the funeral first
These rappers are a kneejerk
They're crying  because they need work
Dont know how to adapt then blast
Blow out your back
Aim for your spine like that
I lose and get my brain back
Lobotomized, Ostracized, I am not a lie and I dont lie down
Thought we was cool, you caught a five hahaha
6 chicks, 3 dyking, 3 all for me like a 3 for 1 sell at the club for me
I walk out cheesing, car smell like cheese and
When I light up again I'm cutting the cheese up
I re limp, we pimp, trippy wholehearted-
Eat shrimp, steak prim- 8 ball stacking
That's fat like farm, look at my charm, move back, state farm, crash that
Raekwon wannabees in New Orleans with vocobulary
I rob and very mindless to my behaviour
I got to carry nine guns with nine in the chamber
Behing 8 cars, I'm so Christian
Party like the 9.9.9. it's your century
