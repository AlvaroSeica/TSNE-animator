[Chorus: Weensey] 
Pretty girls, I ask em do they smoke? 
Ask em what do they know? Ask em can we go? 
Pretty girls, Sunshine in the air! 
Perfume everywhere! Girls are everywhere! 
 
[Wale over Chorus] 
Bass to the floor, right now! What up?! 
 
[Verse One: Wale] 
A lime to a lemon remind; you of the sky 
When im fuckin and we on cloud nine for that minute 
Admire your style and your physique 
And I aint trying to critique but you deserve a good drink, so whats up? 
What you sippin on? Its no problem 
Black and gold models like im pro-New Orleans 
But, shawty I'm far from a Saint 
But I got two A-Mex's that look the same way 
Wale, D.C. thats me huh 
My Prada say Prada and they Prada say Fila 
I aint gotta tell ya they know about me, huh 
Come to D.C. and I can make you a believer 
See, baby, I'm a leader they always from a Libra 
And I aint trying to lead you wrong, sugar, I need ya 
So would you please listen to what I'mma need from you 
Here for tonight, but for tomorrow's amnesia 
 
[Chorus] 
 
[Verse Two: Gucci Mane] 
Hey, girl, say, girl, ain't no time to play, girl 
I'm a tell Sean Taylor I want that girl 
Yeah they call me Gucci, but I'mma buy you Louis 
Yellow stones on my wrist remind me of a slushy 
Girl so fine, wanna ride me like a Huffy 
Ugly girls, quiety, pretty girls ride 
Country girl, city girls, love to float by me 
Got her in the bed with kid, straight wildin' 
Took her to the club bought her three more bottles 
She from Rhode Island, Atlanta, I reside in 
Big black diamond, bigger than a black razor 
Asian, Black, Caucasian, or Blasian 
Persuasin so amazing, it's amazing 
How they stand there, cuffed up, patient 
Waiting for the perfect time for conversation 
My observation tell me that she Gucci's baby (baby) 
 
[Chorus] 
 
[Bridge] 
Ugly girls be quiet (quiet), pretty girls clap (clap) like this 
Ugly girls be quiet (quiet), pretty girls clap (clap) like this 
 
[Verse Three: Wale] 
Okay you have em in amazement; switchin four lanes 
In that 09' range while im singing 0-tre shit 
(Let's just dance, come around my way 
you can hear some jams) Its like this all day 
Okay my name's Wale they probably know me from the you know 
Boss in my Hugo, floss like my twofer 
My flow is on Pluto, them rollins ain't plutons 
And a nigga having beef with him gon twist up my new grove 
Ha, yeah shawty thats G-shit, 
Tokyo spinners, yeah shawty thats G-shit 
Please get hip to that new D.C. shit 
On my PG shit, I aint finna keep them 
And I be with P, so I got BBC shit 
Even if I didnt I would ball like arenas - swish 
Now, shawty this is what I'mma need from you 
Here for tonight, but for tomorrow's amnesia 
 
[Chorus] 
 
[Bridge] - 2X </pre>
