[The Grouch]
It's natural, actual, factual..
It's natural, actual, factual.. whoa..

Now maybe it was justice, to have just us ripping you
Sipping brew between my verses, I'm hipping you
to my feelings very strong when I like the song
and my righteous all prolong the set, only a few regrets
I shoulda paused there, heard applause where I didn't
Swear I hit it on the nose, when I spit it they froze
Hands rose, holds down the audience chose sound
Oddly since probably imprints from the last time
hooked em, mass minds took them words
and related, elated from the vibe
I paid it extra attention, check the intentions I have
Wack prevention in effect, seven more Legends on deck
Prevalent minds of all kinds under one roof
Enjoying the truth I spoke, clearly
nearly perfect ennunciation, hear me raise them hands
(put em up) You give me power, enable me to stand
I tower devour the false pretense
Unsigned means indecent once mine makes the sequence he lives out
We give about enough, energy to go 'round twice
so when the flow sounds nice, it's double your pleasure
Now does that measure up to expectation?
Can you feel it, does it give ya, a fresh sensation?
Progressed embraced and laced, with the finest addatives
I had to give it to you straight

No boundaries, I've found the keys
to the lock that blocks my entry to justice
A sound to please, profound with ease, I
rock don't stop this century I bust
It's natural, actual, factual..
It's natural, actual, factual..

Far from make believe, achieved in the flesh
Well received I seen it, with my own eyes
And I've known guys to try and build us down
Conceal the sound from the mass, we steal the towns
Topic of talk and assault on the insecure
when for sure you know we mean no harm
Be armed with only IQ's, turnin heads like fly shoes
Never seen the severed clean crew lives whatever dream, dreamt
and any failed attempts, won't remain
due to attained desire to prosper
Admire the author's offerings
?? brings things so relevant you hella bent on the wordplay
On an absurd day I come, weak feel dumb
Seek out another path speak out, feel my wrath
The motion devotion to the art, from start to finish I'm in it
replenishing the goodness -- as best I know how
Impressed if no wow
I feel fresh still no rest til mission accomplished
Never a pompous troublemaker (who me?)
Do a double-take, for goodness sake, I speak the truth
For real.. everytime I open my mouth

No boundaries, I've found the keys
to the lock that blocks my entry to justice
A sound to please, profound with ease, I
rock don't stop this century I bust
It's natural, actual, factual.. whoa..
It's natural, actual, factual..
It's natural.. actual factual..
It's.. nat-u-ral, fact..
Feel it, peep it, bump it..</pre>
