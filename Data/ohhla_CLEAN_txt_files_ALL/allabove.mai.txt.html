[Verse One: Maino]
Listen! Really what do you see, when you lookin at me?
See me come up from nothin, see me livin my dreams
I've done been through the bottom, I've done suffered alot
I deserve to be rich, headin straight to the top
Look how I ride for the block, look how I rep for the hood
I got nothin but love, now that I come through the hood
Gettin this fortune and fame, will it make all of us change?
The new benz is all white, call it John Mccain
How the hell could you stop me? Why in the world would you try?
I go hard forever, that's just how I'm designed
That's just how I was built, see the look in my eyes
You take all of this from me, and I'm still 'gon survive
You get truth from me, but these rappers 'gon lie
I'm a part of these streets, till the day that I die
I wave hi to the haters, mad that I finally made it
Take a look, and you can tell that I'm destined for greatness

[Chorus: T-Pain]
Tell me what do you see (See) When you lookin at me (Me)
Whoa oh oooh ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!
All I'm wishin to be (Be) What I'm destined to be (Be)
Whoa oh oooh ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I've done been through the pain and the sorrow 
The struggle it's nothin but love (Nothin but love)
I'm a soldier a rider a ghetto survivor and all the above (HEY!!!)
All The above (OH OH!!!!) All the above (OH OH!!!!)
All the aboooooooooovvvvvvvvvveeeeeeeeee!!!!! 
All The above (OH OH!!!!) All the above (OH OH!!!!)
All the aboooooooooovvvvvvvvvveeeeeeeeee!!!!! 
All the above

[Verse Two: Maino]
It's easy to hate, it's harder to love me
Y'all don't understand, y'all quickly to judge me
Put your foot in my Nike's, picture you livin my life
Picture you stuck in the cell, picture you waistin your life
Picture you facin a charge, picture you beatin the odds
Picture you willin to bleed, picture you wearin the scar
Thank you for makin me struggle, thank you for makin me grind
I perfected my hustle, tell me the world ain't mine
You've been seein me lately, I'm a miracle baby
I refuse to lose, this what the ghetto done made me
I put that on my father, tryin to hope for tomorrow
When I think that I can, I envision Obama
I envision in diamonds, I envision Ferrari's
If the world was perfect, all my niggas behind me
Ain't you happy I made it? Man I'm makin a statement
Take a look, and you can tell that I'm destined for greatness   

[Chorus: T-Pain]
Tell me what do you see (See) When you lookin at me (Me)
Whoa oh oooh ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!
All I'm wishin to be (Be) What I'm destined to be (Be)
Whoa oh oooh ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I've done been through the pain and the sorrow 
The struggle it's nothin but love (Nothin but love)
I'm a soldier a rider a ghetto survivor and all the above (HEY!!!)
All The above (OH OH!!!!) All the above (OH OH!!!!)
All the aboooooooooovvvvvvvvvveeeeeeeeee!!!!! 
All The above (OH OH!!!!) All the above (OH OH!!!!)
All the aboooooooooovvvvvvvvvveeeeeeeeee!!!!! 
All the above

[Bridge: T-Pain]
Now if I'm out on the spot (Spot) Or if I'm out on the block (Block)
I hustle hard cause it's all the time (They know, they know)
If you know that crime don't stop (Stop) Because I rose to the top (Top)
And eveybody knows my name (They know, they know)
Hey! I'm still grindin (Still grindin) Still hustlin (Still hustlin)
No more pain (No more pain) No more sufferin (No more sufferin)
My ladies and my shorties and my thugs
Keep on dancin and shinin for love

[Chorus: T-Pain]
All The above (OH OH!!!!) All the above (OH OH!!!!)
