Militant: Dig it, dope peddler
We're out here building a new nation for black people
It's time for you to start payin' some dues, nigga! 
Youngblood Priest: I ain't givin' you shit!

(Intro) AZ
Haha-haha-haha
New drink, Baileys and henny
You ain't got no henny, get the remi
You ain't got the remi, any cognac will do
Smooth criminal shit baby

[Half-A-Mill]
Keyser SÂšze intention, glide in a hummer with the flying saucer engine
Willied out at my crib in the winter having cookouts
Smack my whiz, look out
I'm like Bronner Bros. crap niggas tryna conquer us
They mad, cuz they jump outta cabs and hopped on the bus
Copping dust, Firm clique rock the whole Metropolis
Bitches who burn dick, won't put a stop to us
Niggas who turn snitch, gotta rush
Coward, you ain't a part of us
Send you flowers, you part of the dust
Hard to discuss, this ill life is hard to live up
Once you fall it's hard to get up
Once you ball it's hard to give up
See how it all started up from stick ups
In my father's Dodge pickup, it wasn't really my fathers
But the pulley made the starter kick up
The money made even the hardest get stuck
The smartest get fucked, honest for what?
This world is like Sodom &amp; Gomorrah
Niggas ain't promised tomorrow
Only thing we're promised is projects
False prophets, 50 cent beers, SSI checks
Prison bars, prison yards, Knowledge thru Wisdom, God
Living large, get with the Mob, ain't nothing personal
It's strictly a job, six in the heart, for six hundred lard
We gunning hard, coming hard, hundreds and cars

[Chorus: Half A Mill &amp; AZ]
Quiet money, retired money
Earth, Wind &amp; Fire money, aquire money
You wanna die, try it money
Seven six and five money
Live money, Ill Click to ride from me
Quiet money, retired money
Earth, Wind &amp; Fire money, aquire money
You wanna die, try it money
Seven six and five money
Provide for my Fam and my Fam provide for me

[AZ]
Glaciers of ice, niggas in the race for their life
Raised in the hype, for real killers playing tonight
Basing the pipe, dope-fiends will blaze at your wife
Who want what? Nigga, let's engage in a fight
Glorify wit the gray seal, relay real from the spirit
So niggas can hear it like Curtis Mayfield
Front door shit, we pump raw shit
Pretty portraits, nickel plate gats that gorgeous
On the runway, rip and run, relax on Sunday
Who want a gun play? My mind only work one way
Words of a wise man, got love on the streets I ran
To never snitch, and never flip or even beat my man
Play the game for y'all niggas, rearrange ya shit
E&amp;J ya shit, cuz you say ya rich, haha-haha-haha
Speak subliminal, smooth hustler, black criminal
Smack ya general, even my bitch will clap ten at you
MAC's identical, rarely react when I'm interviewed
In the Q, creep on ya niggas in the new

[Chorus]

[Half-A-Mill]
I still rock Gucci sneakers, money green to match my CREAM
I don't sleep, niggas get splashed in their dream
You couldn't match my team
You ain't original, you like a flugelhorn hollow beam
You was rocking Bugle Boys
Head nodding like you shooting boi
All of a sudden you Super Boy
You just a pigeon in the coup
Peace to them ill cats, living the proof
Manifesting the truth, Firm affil', landing jets on your roof
Exceptional, got a set schedule, ganja festival
Prime line fish and vegetable, I'm skeptical
My man seen it thru his Cartier spectacles
I'm telling you, this BMW life is best for you
The ghetto brung out the hell in you
The heat took over the L in you
Covert of the wilderness, put the spell on you
What's left of you? Caught in the game, is like a hex on you
What's next to do? Not every one's chosen, just a few
I know it's fucked up, when everyone's holding, except for you
Tough luck's gotten the best of you, we living
Hummer wit the flying saucer engine, satellite system
High, travel at night, thru the ninth dimension
Every word, precise wisdom, various furs in this life I'm living
My dunn shoot dice in prison, I would like to mention
My insight is like ice thats glistens
They took a page of my book and built Princeton University
I'm all for this paper personally
You heard of me the first time your purchased a ki
FEDS got pictures of niggas holding bitches and G's
Cut your arms off, in case you got tricks up your sleeves
Split up the cheese, I got hollow tips for the D's
Pimping disease, my bitches swallow ships in the sea
Black Marquise, you ain't a player, you'se a car thieve
Stomp you wit gators on, squash you like beef
Make it hard for your heart to beat
Spray up ya hood, darken the streets
Mark of the Beast, push cars on weekend
We park in the streets that's deep</pre>
