[Frank Ocean]
Daaaaaaaaaamn~! You hungry!
I mean, it's cool, he he
Want some mo'?

I, built, us a little gingerbread house you said you loved it
I, baked, you a little gingerbread Benz, and you said you dug it
I, make, stacks and stacks of cake in the bank, bank
You ate through 'em, you ate through 'em, you ate through 'em, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Tell me how does that taste
Tell me how does that taste, oh
When I re-up, got you coming back
When I'm runnin out, you keep your bags packed
All the Louis shit, and the Benz I baked you
Tell me somethin baby, baby, I can't blame you
When we first met, I know you told me that your taste was crazy
But sweetie, you tell me now that you're craving
You say that Gucci taste good, but Dior tastes amazing
(mazing mazing mazing mazing)
{*AYYYYYYYYYYYYYY*} Baby! (Baby!)

[Frank Ocean]
We took chartered flights all around to taste those malls that
you like most, said the jet food taste like pink raspberry
Good credit, A1, just like that sauce said you liked Ruth Chris way better
Lean back my seat, watch your head go down

[Chorus]

[Frank Ocean]
You say that Gucci taste good, but Dior tastes amazing
(mazing mazing mazing mazing)
I know that you're going to love me as long as your fed, you said
But I like you around -  just want to keep you here
I got to know, girl I ain't runnin out, I ain't runnin out

[Chorus] from "Baby, I can't blame you"

[Frank Ocean]
You say that Gucci taste good, but Dior tastes amazing
(mazing mazing mazing mazing)
Hey baby, I've noticed you eat your jewelry for break'
Hey baby I, noticed you eat your jewelry for break'
Hey baby I, noticed you eat your jewelry for breakfast
I swear, it's crazy</pre>
