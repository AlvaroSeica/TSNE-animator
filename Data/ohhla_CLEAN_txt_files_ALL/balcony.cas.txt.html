Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Cassie]
I don't wanna scream
I don't even wanna tell you
How good it is
Because if it's a dream
I'd only wake myself up
And baby I don't wanna ruin this
Honestly I was scared cause
I know you were prepared
And you knew what I was thinking
All my thoughts, all my cares

Then we made love on a balcony
Right there in New York City
Saw a tourist staring back at me
In Times Square in New York City
And in that moment the city was all ours

[Young Jeezy]
I said she sassy, she classy
Hair cut like she Cassie
Why your voice so raspy
Ooh I hope she nasty (yeeaah)
Lasy night it was kush &amp; Ciroc (yeah) super freak
Told em put it on my black card get a super suite
We could do it right now girl I don't give a fuck
Right here in the valet, we can do it in the truck
Legs on the dashboard, yeah I got her balled up
Maybe it's the kush or the heat but it's fogged up
Gone

[Cassie]
Had a couple drinks
Lit a L it was perfect
Started enjoying the scenery
We couldn't help it
All things have their purpose
The wind it blew through my hair love
I was stunned by your stare
From the sight of you standing there love
I could walk, walk on air

Then we made love on a balcony
Right there in New York City
I Saw the tourists staring back at me (they all staring back at me)
In Times Square in New York City
And in that moment the city was all ours

[Young Jeezy]
Started off on the floor
Ended up on the dresser
Baby girl name is Pam
Why I just call her Vanessa?
I'm on the balcony stylin'
I got her legs on the rail
I knocked that thing out the frame
Like I just got outta jail
She say Young don't you quit
She say Young don't you stop
She say you happy to see me?
I said no girl that's my glock
She said you're G to your heart
You just so stuck in your ways
I said girl what u mean?
Why u still got on your jays?
I said they just dropped today
So imma keep on my shoes
And you keep moaning like that
Then we gonna be on the news
I like bitches with money
She like niggas with power
She said let's do it again
But this time in the shower

[Cassie]
Then we made love on a balcony
Right there in New York City (city, city)
I Saw the tourists staring back at me (they all staring back at me)
In Times Square in New York City
And in that moment the city was all ours</pre>
