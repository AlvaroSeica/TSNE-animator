[Intro]
Razah Rubiez
Yo, let me build with you for a minute, man
Sit down, sit down for a minute
Come here, come here, I just wanna talk to you

[Verse 1]
I try to tell my baby girl "Ain't no need to worry"
It's the last days, ma, I know it's gettin' scary
Niggas gettin' killed, murdered over little crumbs
We gotta step our game up to save our little sons
Can't be havin' our banks with insufficient funds
Mayor Bloomberg, tell me how we get these guns
Why so many mothers who buryin' their young?
And rent is gettin' higher, what is this comin' from?
They wanna turn the slums into a condo
Y'all all up in my convo checkin' my tonsils
On cases, we get 'em, then we beat 'em like congos
On Pico Boulevard, eatin' at Roscoe's
Buildin' on the angels in the realms of the cosmos
Soon as I hit Watts I'ma hook up wit Hydro
The Hell if I know who y'all niggas gon' ride for
We pull up to your side door spittin' at five-0
Cops hate us, everytime that they raid us
They got plans to erase us each time they face us
We get handcuffed and stuffed in America's prison
Inmates on a bus just to make us a livin'
God gave man law, man gave us religion
It's a struggle, no matter you a Muslim or Christian
You a Buddhist or a Hindu, a Crip or Damu
Don't ever ever bite from the hand I lend you

[Outro]
