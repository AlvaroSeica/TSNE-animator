(*talking*)
Agent double-0 Flow nigga
Yeah run it, CTC nigga
Cut the motherfucking check, you dig
This ain't a freestyle, it's a fee to hear me nigga
Yeah, that's right Killa dig the flow bro

[Kyleon]
I'm in a European six, with a European chick
That give me some head, and keep me with a clean dick
Aggravated flow, the boy Killa got a mean spit
My 16's got the seam sewed, like a seam split
Diamonds blue and cold, like the flu do my bling sick
I rock jewels with a attitude, I got a mean wrist
Smoking on some green shit, purple in my soda
Buster see gorilla open, now I'm smoking that yoda
Dash full of cash, in the wall full of yola
A-1 no soda, I'm a I-10 toter
My pockets overweight, from all the cash that I get
While your shit, look like it's on a Atkin's diet
All that bullshit these other clicks selling, we don't buy it
Can't slick a can of oil homeboy, so don't try it
You stuck at the bottom, my click's the highest
You crop dusters we G-4, my click supply it yeah</pre>
