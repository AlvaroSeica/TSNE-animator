Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Come on, Come On.......Come on...... Ca... Come on

If you ever lost the person who was closest to you
I don't know what else to say other then me too
If you ever had feelings inside yourself
So bad... you had died yourself
I try to keep the depression to a minimum
But I done I carried caskets that had my best friends in em
I believe hearts can be so broken there is no mending em
If you recover, you're a true champion
Just know it can be done it's just a test of your faith and god
He gonna be with you every step of the way
I'm a sinner and I know I'm not living right
And if I were to die, out here chasin this rent tonight
Denied at the gates, casted into hell
Some how, that's secondary to cash and living well
Fuck a condo, a mansion, a bentley, and a benz
When I die, I wanna be with my paw paw again.

I had the strangest dreams
Ever since you been gone
They always end holding you
But I wake up here all alone
I had the hardest time
Picking up and moving on
I fall asleep hoping, maybe
I'll wake and you'll be home

Your momma named you Makayla Kay
I call you whop-gotti
I love ya like I never loved nobody
From baby food to hot wings
We done came along way
Daddy work all night and sleep all day or
Daddy work all day and sleep all night
But I couldn't sleep at all if I didn't know you was alright
Maybe one day when you're an older kid
I'll sit down and explain this soldier shit
About loyalty and friendship, honor, and taking vows
And other things you cant understand right now
You just see I'm not around the way I should be
And still she calls me every day to say that she loves me
One day you'll be grown with children of your own
And I hope every moment I'm not gone.
Boo boo, in case I'm not there when you turn thirteen
We all come to red lights, we wont see turn green.

I had the strangest dreams
Ever since you been gone
They always end holding you
But I wake up here all alone
I had the hardest time
Picking up and moving on
I fall asleep hoping, maybe
I'll wake and you'll be home

I done lost a whole lot of people to this thing here
In 98 we lost four in the same year
Sill beer, perpetuates a moment of reflection
And I try to freeze frame that picture of perfection
Me and you chillin, blowin, and getting gone
Back to present day and poof ya gone
All these years and it don't even seem that long
You ain't goin no where (hell no) he's to strong
He just sleeping, standing by the machine beeping
And ya momma said baby he is leaving now
And that machine is the only reason he's breathing now
I said god damn it and ran my fist into the wall
I was fucking with that brawd I oughta been with yall
And all this could of been prevented
It's amazing what can change in a few minutes
But since you been gone so much went by
Nothing changed I still like to ride and get high
And ponder questions, like why I am I still alive
Forty east bound blowing doing ninety five
Why are we even here, the answer to this riddle
Is a question that we been trying to answer
Since we was little, whats my purpose in life
Something big for me to do
Must be because if not then I'd be there kicking it with you.

I had the strangest dreams
Ever since you been gone
They always end holding you
But I wake up here all alone
I had the hardest time
Picking up and moving on
I fall asleep hoping, maybe
I'll wake and you'll be home</pre>
