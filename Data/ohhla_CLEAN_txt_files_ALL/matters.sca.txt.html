(Chorus: Scarub)
It's matters of the heart that rip you apart
Then stop you before you even start
To provide the rules of the chart
Hours glasses you each
Hour that passes you by
You wondering why
Why are you even wasting your time
Following whats in between the shoulders
instead of whats going on in the mind
It's matters of the heart
That keep your eyes open in the dark
Waiting up late for that love one or the wife or husband to come home
When you know they're probably roaming the town
Getting down with some other clown
Screwing around
And when they do you accept their mouth full of excuses
no matter how crazy they sound
It's matters of the heart that keep you high on hoping
Hold you down

(Verse 1: Scarub)
I've heard it all before
Never no more
Save your breath
No one left
Just waiting for the sun to rise
Don't be surprised when i'm gone
Out the front door no looking back
Truth is what you lack
How you gonna mess around behind my back
And then tell me that i'm wrong
I've heard half of  you to break vines
Seen the other side with my own eyes
Didn't want to believe What I saw
It makes no difference if you apologize
The nerve to play me for a follie figure
Extra ounce of melancholy
As if you were to be concerned
The lesson I learn
Is that you gotta be the first to burn
Don't get charred,boiled,foiled,disgrunted as ash that was once something
You gotta be the first one no matter the person
Rehersing the words when you wake up in the morning
Or taking and heart aching hallucination of that lover by your side
Stop faking yourself taking yourself for a ride
It's suicide or and it's slow and it doesn't soothe whats on the inside
Where the real men hide
Practicality and let their fellings fill them up
But less then their emotions to spoil
Like lotion and body oil
Covering up the fucked that was always there
Becoming open minded
You just may be down with your soul mate but because your behind it
Many times people mistake lust for love
but don't see the truth because they blinded
It's matters of the heart that take up all your time
and you can't rewind it

(Chorus)

(Verse 2: Eligh)
What matters to me the most is like honesty is the best policy
Like policies crack between your mullers
A mess can be made of a situation'
Negativities involved and argument
Between two partys thats escalated in enciroments
Like muscles that pump blood through your entire leg of mind state
Get up and get what makes you content
Sit up straight and admit to the shit
Facts been proven a million to one times
Over make it heated in discussion
When in the function unsoberly
Actively action packed in matters of the heart
Lies in deciete of crutins meeting you in the dark
Florescent letters addressed to you
Wrapped in a sweater colder then sickness
Mold in a pickle to keep the message sour
Competition is not my for te
To me this world is my ash tray
For what matters inside is love and art and happiness
Holding on to the pain drags you down
Weight in the shoulders easy to release
Easy to be deceased by the beast
Talking shit straight to the heart
Causes your chances to increase
Honesty, consistent,resistent to uglyness
And other kiss designed to sense a weakness
Crushed under the weights of matters of the heart

(Chorus)</pre>
