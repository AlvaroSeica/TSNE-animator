[Frank Ocean]
Oh oh ohh my, ohh yeah
yeah yeah ohh ohhh love love love, yeah
Hollywood, Hollywood
Heard you like to take the love
That's why I, came to town
With only my brain
Holly baby, baby, yeah baby, yeah
Why do you drive a talent crazy, crazy - yeah~!

[Chorus]
When they call your home, their home, their home, yeah
When they call your home, their home, their home, yeah
And they come from far away to meet ya
Then you break their hearts in pieces
When they call your home, their home, their home, yeah
Yeah and you drive 'em crazy
Holly baby, Holly baby, Hollywood, ohh

[Frank Ocaen]
I met you on, the TV screen
You told me you were single and
we talked about the weather babe
You said it never rains in Southern Cali
Baby, baby
Why do you drive a talent crazy, baby yeah
