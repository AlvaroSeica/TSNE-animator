"They say nothin wrong
 A change is gonna come
 You know, and I know, you know that I know
 I know that you know, honey that a change is gonna come, ohh..."

[Intro: Joell Ortiz]
First you clean his hands from top to bottom, grand afferents then wash 'em
Then you go pick the cotton, listen y'all I'm tired
Man I swear {"I've been running"} for so long tryin to be strong
But yo {"I've been running"} I'm exhausted {"Ohh yeah"}
My feet hurt {"I don't"} wanna run no more
{"I don't"} Wanna run no more {"I don't know what's a bed"}
They said {"A change is gon'"} when?
{"A change is gon'"} When? {"A change is gon' come every day, ohh"}

[Joell Ortiz]
Uh, ain't nothin changed 'cept the chains ain't restrainin 
our physical frame, mentally we still livin the same
It's lockdown, they knock down the Towers to raise tax
Anything they burn we pay back
I live in the hood; you'll never bump into Pat Sajack
But we spin the wheel every time we chill cause cops hate blacks
And Hispanics they draw gats and just blam it 
before they ask where your hand is
I don't see how a wallet can be mistaken for a cannon
So please don't let 'em play us no more
In every way I'm ready, willin and able to war
Like any day now I could pop, I'd be in the front
Like, please may the force be with me and this pump
Housing want me to work, cause I'm still on my mom's lease
Threatenin to raise the rent if I don't pick up them park leaves
Ain't nothin in this world for free
But somehow they got us fooled like this world is free

[Chorus: Joell Ortiz]
This is modern day slavery, you see {"yes"} carry I.D. {"yes"}
Water is a fee {"yes"} this ain't how it's supposed to be
Man {"I've been running"} for so long tryin to be strong
But yo {"I've been running"} I'm exhausted {"Ohh yeah"}
My feet hurt {"I don't"} wanna run no more
{"I don't"} Wanna run no more {"I don't know what's a bed"}
They said {"A change is gon'"} when?
{"A change is gon'"} When? {"A change is gon' come every day, ohh"}

[Immortal Technique]
Yeah, yeah
Our people are the product of, genocide and slavery
Everything in the ghetto was how it was made to be
Designed in a process, Prison Industrial Complex
Niggaz transformed into numbers and objects
We pay the devil rent for livin in hell
Cause the projects was built on the spot where Lucifer fell
Incarcerated knowledge heavy weight (heavy nigga)
Every black man should read through the Romany Chapter 28
Cursed in the city like we're cursed in the field
Cursed on the border, and cursed by the New World Order
Our sons and daughters were stolen by another people
Yolkavian{?}, end of the Earth, land of the Eagle
This is the sequel to the prophecy
Freedom whether peaceful or violent is my philosophy
I built an army, now I'm gonna build a nation
The foundation of a new civilization, and overthrow the plantation

[Chorus: Immortal Technique]
This is modern day slavery, see {"yes"} it was designed to be {"yes"}
Patriot Act 3 {"yes"} just wait young nigga, you'll see
{"I've been running"} For so long, my people been so strong
But yo {"I've been running"} I'm exhausted {"Ohh yeah"}
My heart hurts {"I don't"} but I'm gunnin them all {"I don't"}
But I'm gunnin them all - fuck them niggaz! {"I don't know what's a bed"}
Yeah, I said, we gotta make 'em {"A change is gon'"}
We gotta make 'em {"A change is gon'"}
Quick motherfucker, lock and load

[Outro: Immortal Technique]
Yeah, Immortal Technique, Joell Ortiz
Yea, Harlem, Brooklyn
You know what it is nigga</pre>
