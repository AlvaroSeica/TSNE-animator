[Intro: Willie the Kid]
Fuck yo...

[Chorus x3: Willie the Kid]
What the fuck's goin' on?
Gun Rule, big guns, bitches lovin' it
Bitches lovin' it

[Willie the Kid]
Yo, W.T.K., runnin' through ya hood like M.L.K.
Grey C.L.K., S.U.V., M.L.K.
H.K., rapid spray, gun play, stack and pay
4-0, 1-K, mutual funds in my way
Headbuster in my ride, somebody die, in my eye
Bulletproof, tint the ride, Michigan militI
Outrageous, cake ridiculous, play the club, takin' pictures
Gang related, throwin' hand signs, rock paper scissors
Sign language, rock bakes, pattin' leather, snake or lizards
Sneaker lustin', reefer puffin', we conductin' great business
Bling bling, understandment, Sing Sing, undertakement
Put you put you under pavement, if you slippin', missin' payments
Bill collector, Will got extra, cheddar off the bills, exctera
Not Excedrin, cop the weapon, Jerichos, fuck ya weapon

[La the Darkman]
Niggaz call me a lot of shit, but they can't call me broke
If I ain't pushin' trees, I'm pushin' E's or coke
With a Cannon in my coat, hardly laugh, ain't a joke
Any fire confrontation, a nigga gon' get  smoked
Might hit you with a gemstar razor or a red dot laser
Take a piece of meat off ya when I blaze ya
Like Albert Anesthesia, I'm a mobster, I'm major
I'm loyal to my blood, not a faggot-ass traitor
Big brother hustle great, I gotta hustle greater
My operation's so smooth, they call me ice skater
Cuz I figure eight great, when I'm movin' that weight
Syran wrap, Vaseline, ship it to a different state
Gettin' rich is my fate, keepin' G's in my hands
Diamond bezel Seleny, alligator leather band
I'm exquisite, my Malcolm Little thoughts, so vivid
I walk it how I talk it, cuz believe me, I live it
In my safe, six digits, stash box in a Caddy
I run my house, nigga, like Michael Jackon's daddy
So listen, it's La the Darkman, I'm on a mission
I air the crowd out like the Pacers and the Pistons
Motherfuckers!

[Chorus]</pre>
