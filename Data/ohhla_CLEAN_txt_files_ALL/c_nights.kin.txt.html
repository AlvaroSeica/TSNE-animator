[Intro: Kinetik &amp; Tone Richardson]

Yup, I'm out in California
My first time on the West Coast
I'm having such a good time, I really don't wanna leave
I'm loving it here [I ain't ready to leave]
I love it so much, I might start crip walking and just throwing up a "w" or something

[Chorus: Kinetik &amp; Tone Richardson]

Another night in Cali-forn-i-a
I'm getting twisted like oh my days
I love it here and I really wanna stay
Another night in California
Another night in Cali-forn-i-a
I'm getting twisted like oh my days
I love it here and I really wanna stay
Another night in California

[Verse 1: Kinetik]

Saturday night and I'm loosening up
[I'm doing my little two step in front of the mirror you know]
I'm in the house with the booze in my cup
[A yo, Jeremy pour me another J.D. bruv]
Cars outside hear the boom of the funk
[You know who that is, that's Masato]
And my clothes match so I'm never losing my touch
[Cause you know we black folk have to co-ordinate man]
Crazy now we're headed down Saratoga
Tonight's the night I wish I had a chauffeur
In the club everybody wants to have us over
Sitting at the table or laxed on the sofa
We shoulda got a round of claps
It's all love and we must've had a thousand chats
And even more heads are coming from around the back
It's "Hey Mr. D.J.", I like the sound of that

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Kinetik]

Bright lights got me thinking I'm in showbiz
[I can't lie, I feel like a super star]
Nice night but what's happening at Blowfish
[I heard about Blowfish back in London]
I'm getting funny looks so I suppose it's
[Cah dem know sey me look like a true bad bwoy]
The Sprerry's on my feet looking sweet getting noticed
[I'm gonna need that sponsorship money though]
Wavy, that's how I felt from the A.M.F.
It's adios, I'm ghost, I should be laid to rest
Rusty nails are the most pain
Sipping liquid cocaine got me twisted with no shame
Folks came just to party hard
We're getting drunk and it's looking like we can't be charged
I'm paralytic off the liquor and my back is to the wall
Posture lean but you know I'm having a ball

[Bridge: Kinetik &amp; Tone Richardson]

Give me one more night, one more day
One more night in California
Okay, so it's 3 A.M. and the night is still young
But before we go home
We're gonna bring back a classic
Shout out to Zhan√©
Hey Mr. D.J., hey Mr. D.J, hey

[Second Chorus: Tone Richardson]

Everybody 
Move your body now do it
Here is something 
That's gonna make you move and groove
Hey D.J. keep playing that song 
All night
On and on and on
[One more time Tone]
Everybody 
Move your body now do it
Here is something 
That's gonna make you move and groove
Hey D.J. keep playing that song [keep playing]
All night [all night]
On and on and on
[On and on and on and on]</pre>
