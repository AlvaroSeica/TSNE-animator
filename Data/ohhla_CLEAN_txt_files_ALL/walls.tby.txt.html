(hook) 
the walls are trembling, it's time to break 
time to break, break them down 
beneath the beliefs 
rebuild ourselves piece by piece 
so all the lost can find our way 
find our way, our way home now 
we've been all alone 
trapped so long that we called it home 

every morning when he woke up he cried 
thinking back on the moment that had so many times 
replayed in his head, showed in his eyes 
when his father and brother lost both of their lives 
attacked on the way home for the night 
their bus exploded, he was the only survivor 
guilt like a poison growing inside 
till the fight took over his mind 
looking after his mother, close by her side 
most of the time, consoled by the idea 
of getting revenge on all of those on the side 
of those that had fired on his 
to reclaim his own bit of pride 
as he sunk deeper in religion becoming 
more of a victim than he originally was 
learning all the love songs written in blood 
by blind poets, eyes focused now on living the struggle 

(hook) 
the walls are trembling, it's time to break 
time to break, break them down 
beneath the beliefs 
rebuild ourselves piece by piece 
so all the lost can find our way 
find our way, our way home now 
we've been all alone 
trapped so long that we called it home 

finally the order was sent from command 
stepping with weapon in hand into enemy lands 
thoughts dancing on avenging his family 
when he saw the target, was like he entered a trance 
opened...fire...didn't care who they shot 
bullets falling from the sky like they were some raindrops 
some stood still standing in the same spot 
families falling all around them, finally they dropped 
to the ground...hear the sound 
of silence, hit him in the chest 
knocked him to the ground 
as he saw all those innocent children 
he flashed back to when he witnessed the killing 
of his family...and in that instant of feeling 
his walls crumbled down upon the myths that had built them 
evil is a concept we made up because 
we see the actions and want to separate them from us 
the right situation mixed with anger or love 
and these are actions that all of us are capable of 
looking at the fruit of his labor 
he fell to his knees in confusion and shame 
suffered so much pain from his losses 
the flag shaped scars stained on his conscious 
exhausted, tears rolled down his eyes 
turned the gun on himself 
opened his mouth up wide and fired 

(hook) 
the walls are trembling, it's time to break 
time to break, break them down 
beneath the beliefs 
rebuild ourselves piece by piece 
so all the lost can find our way 
find our way, our way home now 
we've been all alone 
trapped so long that we called it home 

break it down, break, break it down 
break it down, break, break it down 
break it down, break, break it down 
break it down, break, break it down 
break it down, break, break it down 
break it down, break, break it down 
break it down, break, break it down</pre>
