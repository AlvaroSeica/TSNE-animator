[ VERSE 1 ]
Ghetto eyein, ghettoes dyin, ghettoes cryin
Unemployment, no hirin, ghetto firin
But we got the heart of a lion
The music to our ears is the sound of a siren
Most don't stand a chance
Get stuck, can't advance
Criminal record or in a ambulance
Gangbangers considered soldiers
Killin each other on the street got they mother in foreclosure
The Lord knows ya, Lord chose ya, Lord hold ya
Is exposure, can't keep my composure
I love Obama, he ain't the savior
No unity in my community, we don't 'love thy neighbor'
Ghetto folks, change your behavior
Be braver, pick the fruits of our labor
And stop fallin for these tricks
When white America get a cold, black people get sick

[ VERSE 2 ]
You want the milk, go eat the honey
Why? Cause my message can beat your money
You unprepared, unaware
You either runnin free or you runnin scared
So how you runnin?
(How you runnin, dog?)
Or is it just your mouth you're runnin?
I'm hunger-driven, unforgiven
Everybody high like the cost of livin
All takin, no givin
I got bitch knowledge, hoe wisdom
You a math major, all division
Altered vision, I take aim, all precision
I get mine, step back
It always gets dark before it gets black
Yo, so who's keepin time?
From champagne to cheap wine
You speakin for money? I'm speakin my mind</pre>
