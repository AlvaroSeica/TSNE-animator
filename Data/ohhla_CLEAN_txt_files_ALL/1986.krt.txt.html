[Chorus]
Like it was 1986, yeah I'm back bitch
Big money, subwoofer, Randy Savage
It was 1986, yeah I'm back bitch
M.C. twenty-four crawling through the traffic
It was 1986, yeah I'm back bitch
Rolling clean, hella screen, digi-dashed it
It was 1986, coldest year ever
Momma could have cut me out the womb but she knew better

[Big K.R.I.T.]
Digi my dash, this for the players
that got them some golds, and copped them some gators
Fresh' than a motherfucker, I knew what it took
The game that I'm giving you, couldn't get out a book
Now don't be tricking no hoes, don't be lending your ride
And if you fuck, wear a rubber cause they burning inside
If it don't pay what you're asking, then you're wasting your time
If you can't get you no old school, don't go fucking with mine

[Chorus]

[Big K.R.I.T.]
Watching for jackers, scoping for law
They go to hating when I'm bassing cause I swang and I crawl
Scraping the wall, rubbing the curb
A chef with the whipping, my trunk shaken and stirred
I got a fetish for Chevys, an itch for the dollar
On the hunt for a freak, down to fuck if she swallow
I be popping my collar till I'm dead in a tomb
Hell, I've been popping my collar since I fell out the womb

[Chorus]

[Big K.R.I.T. - singing]
Feels good to have it
Knowing that I did what I could
It feels good to have it
I put the leather on top of the wood
It feels good to have it
I rode chrome all around my streets
It feels good to have it
to see it, to need it, to grab it
Feels good to have it

[Chorus]</pre>
