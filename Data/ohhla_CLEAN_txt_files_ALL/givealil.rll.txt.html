Song:   Give a Little Love
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
You just give a little love and it all comes back to you
You know your gonna be rememberd for the things that you say and do

[Bashy]
Boof, Yo it's BBB
Could be anything I wanted to be
Like movin x-men
Put the thought in my mind inception
From the hood where the fullstop don't mean the end of your sentance
We're tryna' get out like attention
Say cheese when I smile, See chedder
In like don't be bitter, be better

[Wretch 32]
I started with nothing but an idea
Following my own steps in my Nike airs
Yeah, it was all or nothing
My story tryna' find a buzz in a lightyear
I go in when I step outdoors
You can't put in less and get out more
I went from opening locks
To sellin' Jumpers so I'm over the top

[Chorus]
You just give a little love and it all comes back to you
You know your gonna be rememberd for the things that you say and do

[Manga]
Yo
And I fully beleive in karma
So I keep focused and I work harder
Puttin' my feet down just like a farmer
Show them love and watch them go faster
A couple 'dem try and say that we couldn't
But, yes we can Obama
And that's why I see supeheroes in all of us Peter Parker</pre>
