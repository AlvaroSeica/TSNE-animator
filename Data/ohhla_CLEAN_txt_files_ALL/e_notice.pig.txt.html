Typed by: pbwlf@yahoo.com

[PJ] Yeah, do you go to uhh, 70th street?
[Man] Yeah we go up yeah
[PJ] Alright, hmm, how much is it?
[Man] It's $1.35, you gotta move up
[PJ] Oh, I have $1.25, is there...
[Man] No, no you gotta go, you gotta go

Woke up in the mornin' and yo what did I see? (What did you see?)
Eviction notice on the floor lookin' at me (What did you do?)
Fell back on to the bed and into insanity
Cause I've been losin' my job since he age of 16
Let me tell it now, let me tell you how life is sho'
Most of my life yo I been po'
Workin' ever since 16 years old
Life is a game but I wanna fold
If I want more then I gotta sow
If I don't sow then I turn cold
Brought up in the wind, tryin' to pretend that everythings dandy
But you know, you know, rather be full of clarity
Than, runnin' in rippin' with no sense of sincerity
Cause, cause with no heart, things don't last
Tryin' to be cool with my bus pass
Cause I know things is gonna work out
Gimme a shout, this too will pass

Whoaaaah
Come on sing the song now
Whoaaaah
When you're wonderin' how
Whoaaaah
When your phone line gets cut off
Whoaaaah
Come on and sing
Whoaaaah
Come on sing the song now
Whoaaaah
When your car breaks down
Whoaaaah
And your girlfriend leaves you
Whoaaaah
Come on and sing

Losing my friends and passion over record contracts
Wanna be so young again wish to take it all back
Two sweaty little niggies rappin' over bomb tracks
And then get hungry so we all go Taco Bell wrap
But now all we do is work to the bone
Gettin' kinda older now its showin'
Bills to be paid and still don't own
Flat broke still got a cell phone
Sleepin' on a couch don't got a home
Wanna be a rapstar sittin' on chrome
But I know in time things gonna change and rearrange
And I'm gonna show 'em
Been through this (been through this) long before (long before)
Sittin' knockin' waitin' at the same old door
But I gotta go ain't waitin' no mo'
If the door ain't open break through the window
New breed to be gonna take it off for the kingdom
When the bells sing this song

Whoaaaah
Sing the song now
Whoaaaah
When you're wonderin' how
Whoaaaah
When your phone line gets cut off
Whoaaaah
Come on and sing
Whoaaaah
Come on come on sing the song boy
Whoaaaah
When your car breaks down
Whoaaaah
And your girl straight leaves you
Whoaaaah

Come on and sing
Come on and sing (Whoaaah) [4X]

Wake up, brand new day here
On my way dear
Worry out the door (4X)

Whoaaaah
Come on sing the song now
Whoaaaah
When you're wonderin' how
Whoaaaah
When your phone gets cut off
Whoaaaah
Come on and sing
Whoaaaah
Come on come on sing the song girl
Whoaaaah
When your car breaks down
Whoaaaah
When your boy friend leaves you
Whoaaaah
Come on and just call me
