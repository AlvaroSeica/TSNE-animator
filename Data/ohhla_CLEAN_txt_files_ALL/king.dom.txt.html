[Intro: "King of New YOrk" samples]
Okay, from here on, nothing goes down unless I'm involved
No blackjack, no dope deals, no nothing
A nickel bag gets sold in the park, I want in
	You think you're gonna live long enough
	To spend that money, you fucking hump

[Dom Pachino]
Pumping rocks on the block like all day
Niggas playing ball, shooting round of Spalding
Plans of being king off codeine, morphine
Cocaine, a wrong for dope fiends, life of a hood kid
Ain't bright, unless there's more green
More weed, means more steam, yea they touch in school
That drugs ain't cool, but it's survival
Don't hold me, accountable, reliable
For those who get killed in the process of this nonsense
Cuz it was by choice, like when Eve seen the apple and bit it
He seen the crack pipe and hit it
Right after he lit it, he said that's the shitted
I'm not proud of myself nor the government
They put this shit here, so the poor man discovered it
A weak mine's fell in love wit it
That's when the undercovers hit
They want us all in jail, atleast minorities
Black and latinos, that's living in poverty
And in the urban areas, we the majority
And students study us in schools like Harvard, g
I'm king of New York, the soniority
Slugs whisper, twist your vital arteries
Making music since I was 9, cuz it's a part of me
Multi million dollar deals, sorta like the lottery
Like the lottery, like the lottery
I'm bout to it

[Chorus 2X: Dom Pachino]
K for the Killa in me, I for Intelligent
N for Napalm, and the God bout to settle this
Staten Island delegate, what you buying, I'm selling it
Step out of line, the nine split your melon quick

[Dom Pachino]
I put the new tax bracket, mills in the vault stacking
Drugs to rapping, quit acting like it can't happen
I bare witness, to the sickest individuals
Accumilate riches, and rep Staten, bitches
This ain't a fairy tale, if so, I know it very well
The seven dwarfs be my cartell selling that snow white, all night
On park benches, in broad daylight
Until midnight, til it's all gone
That's when I collect, I have a meet with the Don
At the round table, delegating, location Napalm label
Tune in, your boy is on cable
Often flossing, I was abandoned like abortions
You'd rather see me in a coffin, cuz of extortion
Then I'mma rider, like the Four Horsemen, just in a Porsche, man
See me, approach me, extreme caution, and scream king

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
