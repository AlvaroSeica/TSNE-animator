Whatever my targets on
I carpet bomb
My man Karthik gone, wrong
running out of sodom
with a semi lob on
Smelling rotton, that's a horses head
in your daughters bed
cos I caught you slipping
now I'm sitting in your kitchen
Safe crackers grey matter
sprayed back, (uh)
my heist game remain dapper
gay chatter, made you sound like
the queerest fella
trying to tickle with the nearest feather
make you fear this cellar, you'll be here forever
I was just a teen
jumping on my trampoline
smoking ample green
getting lean
with this tramp Pauline
Once she tried to set me up
I had to trample fiends
grabbed her by the ankle ring
and mangled her like a mandarin
Then for no reason
I told Liam, the Cambodian opium
that I sold Ian at 4pm
was old and mouldy and
so he's O.D'in
cold and he won't speak
and his nose and his throats leaking</pre>
