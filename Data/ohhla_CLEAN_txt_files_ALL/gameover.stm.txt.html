[Chorus]
Whatcha gonna do when the game is thru
Whatcha gonna do when your life is due

[Verse 1]
Back in the day you see I used to live a hard life up in the hood
Roaming around the dark streets at night up to no good
Slowly creeping down the wrong road having my fun
With the homies cruising the wrong boat that's how it was
I was young and didn't know better call me na√Øve
My family had no cheddar no room to breathe
I had given in to peer pressure but didn't wanna
It was getting hard for me so I moved in with my grandfather
had to make a choice quick cause I was living
a lifestyle resulting in death or prison
so I got my life on track gave my life to God
Doing better than before couldn't ask for more
So why you holding back what's it gonna take?
For you to understand and see that you can finally make
The decision of your life so whatcha gonna do
Before this party called life decides to end with you!

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Now just analyze your lifestyle what will it say
And what's it gonna take for you to change your way
You may be having fun now but it will it last
When you're driving on the wrong side your bound to crash
Now whatcha gonna do when the party's through
No more weed to get high no more gin and juice
Your homies that were there before no where to find em
You thought you hade some friend's bro ducking and hiding
What if Jesus comes back to take his church away
What if something goes down will you be saved
Fooling nobody dogg but yourself
Doesn't matter if you gain the world and all its wealth
So why you holding back what's it gonna take
For you to understand and see that you can finally make
The decision of your life now whatcha gonna do
Before this party called life decides to end with you

[Chorus]</pre>
