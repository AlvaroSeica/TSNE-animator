[Zach de la Rocha]
Hey, don't miss out on what you're passing
You're missing the hootah of the funky buddah
Eluder of the fucked up style's that get wicked
So come on as I start to kick it
'Cause we're like outlaws stridding [while] suckers are hiding
Jump behind the bush when you see me driving BY
Hanging out my window, and my magnum taking out some putos
Acting kind of loco I'm just another local kid
From the street getting paid for my vocals
Here is something you can't understand
How I Could Just Kill A Man!

[Hook]
Here is something you can't understand
How I Could Just...Kill A Man!
Here is something you can't understand
How I Could Just...Kill A Man!
Here is something you can't understand
How I Could Just...Kill A Man!
Here is something you can't understand..

I be doing all the dumb shit, yo, cause nothing is coming from it
I'm not gonna waste no time fucking around, I got ya humming
Humming...coming at ya!..
Then you know I had to gat ya!
Time for some action, just a fraction of friction
I got the clearance to run the interference
in to your satellite, shining a battle light
Swing out the gat and I know that we'll gat you right
Here's an example just a little sample...
How I Could Just Kill A Man!

One-Time tried to come in my home
Take my chrome, I said "Yo it's on!
Take cover son...or you're assed out!
How do you like my chrome?" Then I watched the rookie pass out
Didn't have to blast him but I did any way
Ha ha ha! Young punk had to pay..
So I just KILLED the maaaan!

[Hook]
Here is something you can't understand
How I Could Just...Kill A Man!
Here is something you can't understand
How I Could Just...Kill A Man!
Here is something you can't understand
How I Could Just...Kill A Man!
Here is something you can't understand
How I Could Just...Kill A Man!

[*guitar riff*]

It's gonna be a long time before I finish
One of the many missions that I have to establish
To light my spliff, ignite you with these site
So if you ain't down...BULLSHIT!
Say some punk tried to get you for your auto
Would call the one time and play the role model?
No! I think you'll play like a thug
Next hear the shot of a magnum slug
Humming...coming at ya!..
Yeah you know I'm going to gat ya!
How do you know where I'm at
When you haven't been where I've been
Understand where I'm coming from!
While you're up on the hill in your big home
I'm out here risking my dome, just for a bucket or a fast ducket
just to stay alive, yo, I got to say "FUCK IT!"

Here is something you can't understand, how I could just kill a man..
Here is something you can't understand, how I could just kill a man..
Here is something you can't understand, how I could just kill a man..
Here is something you can't understand, HOW I COULD JUST KILL A MAN!!

[Hook]
Here is something you can't understand
How I Could Just...Kill A Man!
Here is something you can't understand
How I Could Just...Kill A Man!
Here is something you can't understand
How I Could Just...Kill A Man!
Here is something you can't understand
How I Could Just...Kill A Man!
Here is something you can't understand
How I Could Just...Kill A Man!
Here is something you can't understand
How I Could Just...Kill A Man!
Here is something you can't understand
How I Could Just...Kill A Man!
Here is something you can't understand
How I Could Just...Kill A Man!
