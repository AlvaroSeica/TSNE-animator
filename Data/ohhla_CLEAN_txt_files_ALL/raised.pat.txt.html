[Hook]
I was raised in the projects, projects
I was raised in the projects, projects - 6x
I was raised in the

[Verse 1]
Tryin to floss in the projects, mayne get ya jacked off
Run up on ya with the Mausberg, face smacked off
You could be the nigga on the curb, get ya crack off
Fingers on the trigger full of herb, never slack off
Same gorilla tactics over here, pocket swollen
Pretty white guts, rims big as a Samoalan
Jollyrancher colors on the whips we be rollin
North Memphis, Dirty South, you know that I'm holdin
the hood on the weight of, my nigga you stay up
Locked down now the town gettin my pay up
It's Project Pat, the haters say, "Oh no"
Hypnotize stackin money by the boat load

[Hook]
I was raised in the projects, projects
I was raised in the projects, projects - 5x
I was raised in the

[Verse 2]
We still cock 'em up, rock 'em down, come up love, ride the town
Flexin out, lookin good, still the same in the hood
Full of dope, full of crosses, ain't no love, ain't no losses
Niggaz greed, want it all, Cut the throat, of the bosses
Got them diamonds in the teeth, in the watch, in the Range
Diamond out, neckalace, diamond out, Fendi frame
You stay sweatin the police cars on bricks
Givin fake names mayne dodgin all warrants
In the projects dope bodies'll get hauled off
You got twelve years old out here shootin sawed off
These big booty chickens got suckers turnin necks
Project Pat, Dirty South, welcome to the projects

[Hook]
I was raised in the projects, projects
I was raised in the projects, projects - 5x
I was raised in the</pre>
