[Hell Razah]
9-7, grab your righteous thougts
And get rid of em, its the 5 Deadly Venomz
Grab your righteous thoughts and get rid of em
Its the 5 Deadly Venomz
Grab your righteous thoughts and get rid of em
Its the 5 Deadly Venomz, yo

Chorus: Hell Razah (4x)

Aint nuthin new about the Sunz of Man
We cant be Tony Touched
You either build or destruct us

[Killah Priest]
Near em Tony Touch, I grab MC's within my clutch
And crush, I wip my hand while oppenents stand off
And look sad and worthy, bloodthirsty
No mercy, I kill em while they curse me
And damn po-9 to search me, dont get me started
I flip retarded and start chokin artists
And leave they kidz broken harded
I'm fatherless, I'm too marvaless
Why would you bother this
I squeeze you neck til the saliva drip
So tight, I bite off my bottom lip
Until your head pop and your soul leave
Whoeva told you I was holy, I'm Killah Priest

[Makeba Mooncycle]
Eliminate my competition like a Shogun
So bad, I have you switchin colors like Michael Jackson
Represent from Crown Heights to Bedstuy
You either do, you either die, while your tryin to survive
All these street lyrics are like Psalm
So, Brklyn maniacs remain calm
So, come get some from Park Place to Putnam
We hold shit down like Franklin Av
You get shot, gaged and stabbed, buyin gunz from the arabs
Ah, Makeba a true bitch beata
Gotcha hot like a heata, when its pumpin out ya tweatas
Flippin American's like Nazi Arena
&gt;From Gracia to Aruba, behind the Sunz of Man, you see Moncycle

[Prodigal Sunn]
4th Disciple, what, blazin like a rifle

[Hell Razah]
I see too many wannabes be livin comfortably
Southern, comfort me, whats the reason why you front to be
Sumthin like it only took you months to be
Personnaly, I take your mentality to Mercury
Bring you back to Earth to see, the same ol
Check the Sunz of Man lingo, we got for minutes, defendants
Wack students get suspended, shoot you down with a sentence
As you back for repentance, Sunz of Man cant be Tony Touched
Dreddy roll the dutch, crunch berries in my cup
Bitches stress to test my lust, quick, you bustin guns on us
We move crowds like clouds, lightnin struck whoeva sucks
Some claim to be Allah's, they force gods
Sellin out for cars, tellin lies to the stars
Why you front at clubs and bars, we be in tune with Mobb's
Royal Fam, United Kingdom, now expand, got to war like the Pakistans
Been fightin devils since the sonagrams
Now its, programs on my avenues, satin out to master you
Live daily masker you

[Prodigal Sunn]
Yo, in these dark days of Vietnam
Death is a pawn, thats word iz bond
Sound the alarm, we surround calm
Bury arms, spark a mega-charm
Rockin charms, true and livin Islam
My supreme wisdom becoms a realistic sitcom
On the grounds of Brklyn, sent you walkin thru the Crklyn
So, until then I make ends meet, war with the beast
In the streets of heat, movin is weak, formation concrete
Medina slodier, mathematical, alphabetical
Quoted an intelligent sire, contain the element of fire
Mental ignita, who said the student bout the lighta
As it was written, bitten in the book of Objia
Shower soldiers, sold for papaya
Original soul writter, the golden fighter
Swift, clever like the tiger
So, on the contrary, you can get bloody like Mary
Head flown, like a tooth fairy, crushed like some berries

(Chorus: 3x)

[Hell Razah]
Black Rose Family, Gray Rose, Touny Touch, what
Tru Masta, yea, what, 4th Disciple, Killah Priest
Prodigal Sunn, Hell Razah, 60 Sec., what
7th Ambassador, what

(Chorus)</pre>
