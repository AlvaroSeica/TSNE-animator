I wake up in the morning, and I ask myself
Is life worth living, should I blast myself
Before I go to sleep at night, I ask myself
Is life worth living, should I blast myself
Look at myself in the mirror, and I ask myself
Is life worth living, should I blast myself
I got problems, but too much pride for me to ask for help
So is life worth living, should I blast myself
 
[Z-Ro]
Tell me where to go, to get a piece of mind
Cause all I see is suicide, recieveing me by my tech nine
Although my tattoo reads, no more pain
Lately I feel the needle hit me up, in vein
Most of my real niggaz are dead, they done left me with my fake friends
The ones that always need ya, but don't appreciate friends
I'm solo when I roll, I live and die by myself
That way nobody can blame me, for the death of somebody else
Cause the way these niggaz hate me, is an epidemic
I'm in the line of fire, 24-7 constantly stepping in it
Hate me cause I'm doing good, hate me cause I ain't doing bad
At least I got to be a dad
But I've got no seeds, I use to bleed for some other cat's creation
But as far as I'm concerned, I would of burned for those creations
My family didn't make it, make me wonder will I last myself
So is life worth living, should I blast myself

It ain't that I sound like Pac, I sound like stress
Just like an automatic, when I'm down and depressed
I shed tears, cause I do it so good
Thanks to my nothing ass homies off the block, nigga fuck my hood
I couldn't shit shower shave, unless I was willing to pay
That's why I wasn't willing to stay
I could do bad by myself, I ain't even have no money for me
And ya'll was laughing, like me suffering was funny to see
So wonder why I don't give a fuck, about being here
On the other hand I murder motherfuckers, do we have a problem here
If you beat me to the trigger, I ain't mad homie
At least I ain't gotta cry no mo', no mo' feeling sad homie
I know Trae got my back, he gon' look out for my people
God lead me not into temptation, deliver me from evil
If it's my time I'm ready, if it ain't I'ma ask myself
Man is life worth living, should I blast myself

I ain't trying to be a role model, but I am
What kinda role model get arrested, for three hundred grams
I struggle with my addiction, I ain't perfect 
Realizing it's bringing me closer to my grave, so maybe it's worth it
The more coedine I drink, the more I'm not awake 
I'm like a prisoner, and syrup is the way I escape
But this message is to the kids, do as I say and not as I do 
Cause there could be, a brighter future for you 
But as for me all I know is drama, all I know is pain
27 and I don't know to smile, and that's a shame
I came in 1977, the first one
By age ten or eleven, full blown smoking blunts
Cause weed was what I needed, to evade and escape
But reality would enter, smacking me dead in my face
Now that I'm grown I've got no more cheeks to turn, so I ask myself
Man is life worth living, should I blast myself
 
[Hook]
Went to the preacher full of liquor, trying to ask for help
Said is life worth living, should I blast myself
Moving so fast, I done fucked around and passed myself
Man is life worth living, should I blast myself
I'm tired of being broke, where was I when the cash was dealt
Man is life worth living, should I blast myself
I just can't take it, I ain't even gotta ask myself
Maybe life ain't worth living, I'ma blast myself</pre>
