Vegas Lights

[Verse 1: Retrospect]
A man comes home, mad 'cause he lacks the chrome
His mind sporadically flows like a saxophone
He grabs the phone to make a call out of state
His hotel reservation is tomorrow at eight
Now keep it in mind, he has a wife, baby on the way
Yea he's there, but his love's in a different place
Dinner went great, he went to sleep to wake up the next morning
Airplane flight, the jet's starting
He takes off to a place, to make more
Money in great wads, the lights hit him hard
Corruption attracts motherfuckers like magnets
Turns you into a zombie, dissolving your assets
Casino night, he sees no price
Starts betting his life "let me see more dice"
He can't stop, his hand's hot
'Till his luck ran out, and now that nigga's ass out, yo
Everything is gone, he's scared to go home
So he doesn't, and now his baby-momma hustling, damn
Another child is born on this earth without a father
And to try to make it up, yo he never really bothered
Besides that, his mom died at age 30
He never had a father figure, he gave early
He died, 'cause no one was around to raise him right
His family was affected by the Vegas lights

[Chorus]
I know you like the way it shines
'Cause it's calling you back
Got effected by the lights
Now it's all in your stash
L, l, l, light it up homie
Yea, yea yea, light it up homie

Got blinded by the rays
Can't keep it intact
Slowly loosing your composure
'Till the shit is a fact
L, l, l, l, l, light it up homie
Yea, yea y, y, yea light it up homie

[Verse 2: Slow V]
Go ahead and cross that path, you see that flash
You far from home, you can't leave that fast
See it got you trapped got your feelings attached
Just a toss of the batch got you ready to catch
Luminance lights, got you viewing more than the sights
A beautiful night got your eyes opening bright
Caught in the hype got your head floating new heights
Fighting with might but you know the strength of the lights
These rays are ultraviolet you don't need no lenses
Strong enough to even break the bonds of friends
Get you compliments got you confident
This factor always seems to come down to the end
Nowadays people do anything for a buck
Makes it real easy to get reality struck
Ever seem a couple married for so long, so strong
Then all of a sudden the shit's just turning out wrong
It's lust, we fiend for what we can't touch
Same marriage different views, but now divorce is a must
I seen buddies and friends, even closer than kin
Trash everything they had just to make up some ends
All types of people drive for miles just to view these nights
Just to get a small taste of that Vegas life
But I'ma keep my mic strapped when I'm reaching these heights
And keep a clean-cut shade for them Vegas lights

[Chorus]

Shine, shine, shine {*4X*}
Umm hmm {*2X*}
Yea  {*3X*}
Go head and bet all nigga  {*3X*}
Go head and bet it all
It's S.R. {*2X*}
It's Slow V nigga and Retro nigga
Vibe with us</pre>
