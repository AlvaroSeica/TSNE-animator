	1, 2, 3, 4!

[Milk]
Who's this white boy knocking at my door!?

[Ad Rock]
Well it's the King Ad Rock and I'm a goddamn fool
Don't give a fuck about the golden rule
Because you know I get fly, I'm high, I'm gone
Listen all of y'all, because my word is fucking bond

[Milk]
I'm the Milk, man, I got game like Ewing
I work real hard like Oakley be doing
Mister 23 couldn't dunk on me
Here's a knee to the ribds, my bad, foul three

[Ad Rock]
Well it's the high-pitched brothers from the East Coast
Rapping on the mic and giving y'all the most
Because I'm the host of disaster, master of shock
You all want a piece of Milk and Ad Rock!

[Milk]
Yeah! Everybody knows that Milk's no killer
But you might catch a headbutt like Reggie Miller
I am what I am that's all that I am
But what I ain't is spam, damn!

	Spam! Ain't the move it's imitation ham!
	Ham is pork and the pork is foul
	Cut it like a pig and that ain't my style
	Two MC's you know we're versatile

[Ad Rock]
So won't you grab the mic and just rock for, a while

[Milk]
Milk's the name I use, I don't smoke Wu's
I'm down to catch a bump and a bruise
But I won't slit my wrist if I get dissed
I drink a quart then I take a long piss

[Ad Rock]
Well it's the intergalactic connection with the rhythm section
And I like to wreck shit so (Latifah sample: Get live, all right?)
I bulit my house on my DJ's cuts
I'm Wilt the Stilt cause I bust a million nuts

[Milk]
Check! I'm unpredictable like the Knick John Starks
When I wreck the mic all you see is Milk sparks
Fire! My voice gets HIGHER and HIGHER
You said I'm not the man, you goddamn liar

[Ad Rock]
Well it's nice to be back in the M-I-X
I'm making all the suckers say "My God, what's next?"
Because I'm on some other type of shit that's odd
But I got a hook for all of y'all and it's

	Spam! Ain't the move it's imitation ham!
	Ham is pork and the pork is foul
	Cut it like a pig and that ain't my style
	Two MC's you know we're versatile

[Ad Rock]
So won't you grab the mic and just rock for a while

[Milk]
Check it out y'all, check it check it out
A check it out y'all, check it check it out

	"This is all very unfortunate, but he made a mistake
	 And he sung, we're not going to have any more trouble
	 He was always a lovely boy"

[Ad Rock]
Well one (One!) two (Two!) three (Three!) four (Four!)
Who's that black guy knocking on my door?

[Milk]
It's the M to the I to the L to the K
I'll split your girl when it's time to hit the hay
Spit in the crowd and curse at the ref
Scream on the mic til you all go deaf

[Ad Rock]
I put a smile on your face from ear to ear
Make a young lady want to shake their rear
Because I got raps, I kick skull snaps
When it comes to rhyming I never hold back

[Milk]
I hate a sucker boy in the skirt and shirt
Trying to act hard but he just don't work
You'd better step left or you might get hurt
Punched in the face and kicked in the dirt

[Ad Rock]
Well I'm Earl the Pearl Monroe and I'm on the go
When I get my flow you know, I'm gone
But you can't catch me with your fucking raps, G
Cause I'm the man, you know I'm never ever no

	Spam! Ain't the move it's imitation ham!
	Ham is pork and the pork is foul
	Cut it like a pig and that ain't my style
	Two MC's you know we're versatile

[Ad Rock]
So won't you grab the mic and just rock for a while

[Milk]
Check it out y'all, check it check it out
A check it out y'all, check it check it out</pre>
