[Verse 1]
Yo, D. Swain is back on the block
He went from laughingstock
To rappin' in happening spots
And nappin' on yachts
Don't get your head wrap in a knot
You gotta unwind
Gotta remind yourself that stress is all in your mind
Speaking of your mind, there's a little place that we all can go
Let me take you to this spot that you never saw before
Close your eyes, and uh
Count to five, and uh
Meet me on the corner of Dream Street and Freedom Drive
This be the venue where anything goes
We staying overnight my nig, did you bring any clothes?
Let's roll

[Chorus # 1]
This cappuccino's
Too cold for me
So grab your stirrers
And roll with me
Let's go to Cafe Surreal
(Lemme get some creamer in here
Lemme get some stirrers, some syrup
Lemme get my dreamers in here)

Relax your mind
Let your conscience free
If you don't wanna come
That's more coffee for me
Let's go to Cafe Surreal
(Lemme get some creamer in here
Lemme get some stirrers, some syrup)
{*beatboxing*}

[Verse 2]
This is a dream, right?
That's what you thinkin', right?
Stop all that thinkin'
You thinkin' too much for me tonight
Just let your mind roam free, grab a seat by the front
I'll go grab us some coffee, how many creamers do you want?

[Chorus # 1]

[Verse 3]
Surrealism got you feeling imprisoned?  Don't let it
Just chill and listen to the intricate sounds
Of Mr. Renowned, I'm renowned around the globe
And I'm inviting you to pack your favorite gown or robe
Or whatever you're sleeping in, just keep it thin, pack light
Don't act like, you don't remember what happened last night
You're now tuned to my nocturnal fantasy
Never mind that melting clock, disregard that dancing tree
Can it be?  Danny l-l-losing his marbles?
Imagination, I've got a jarful
Carpool if you need a ride, your unconscious is your guide
You can hang your coat by the door, but leave your cares outside
Where's all my fellow free-spirited, open-minded free thinkers?
Free drinks're on me; go grab a latte
But not a lot, hey
'Cause I may need some
Open mic for dreamers, won't you please come?

[Bridge]
Won't you please come
Won't you please come
Won't you please, p-please
Won't you please come
Y'all still with me right?
Cool...now, you know this IS the remix
So I'm gonna have to switch it up on y'all

[Chorus # 2] - 3X
(Two for tea) Two for tea, you and me I hope you like...
(Mayhem) We flyin'?
(Flying) Loosen up, don't sip your cappuccino... (silently)

[Verse 4]
I, had it with rap
So I got on the transit
Disappeared like a bandit
Reworked my style
Nowadays I like to hang at Cafe Sur-re-al
Loosen up, don't sip your cappuccino... (silently)

Niggas is afraid to be themselves these days
Originality's the key
But I'm the only one that's got it on his keychain
D. Swain for mayor, stick T-Pain for paper
Loosen up, don't sip your cappuccino... (silently)

I may be overlooked
But I'm never overworked
My fans go berserk when we in Cafe Surreal
Infatuated with tea, imagination is key
Loosen up, don't sip ya cappuccino... (silently)

But this place ain't for slow-mos
So get in where you fit in, grab a cup of cocoa
Yo, you know I'm still a pro with the prose though
Loosen up, don't sip your cappuccino... (silently)

Y'all can't tell whether I'm peddlin' coffee or
Peddlin' creative energy and free-mindedness
Rewind this disc 'cause by the time you catch on
I'll be on another birthday, my 95th
And everytime I sip on a chai tea
And it ain't hot to me
I'll heat it up and switch it up and change my route
Cafe Sur-re-al remix, D. Swain, I'm out
...you like that?</pre>
