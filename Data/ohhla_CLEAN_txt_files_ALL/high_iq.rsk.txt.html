(Scientist voice: 
"Say, what do you suppose is the most important part of the body?
 Some people say the feet, because we all have to walk.
 Some say the eyes, because we all have to see.
 Some say the heart...[voice becomes distorted]")

(you got emcees, you got entertainers,
 and you got lyricists, which one are you?)

Brace yourself...impact...
crack...BOOM...
motherfuckers,
my molecular structure
is that of an alien
coming out a bald white bitch
On some shit that's wig-splittin'
Got niggas' heads dividing faster
than nerds at a calculus convention
Beyond comprehension
I implement my mental
over instrumentals
and it becomes as detrimental
to a nigga 
as Tuskegee experiments with syphilis
the fundemental rudiments
Studying the phonics of yesteryear
pioneers found buried in sediment plates
trying to metrate alphabetics
It took two weeks to estimate the way the old school emcee's said it
I break down the elements
of rocking a mic cable
like a periodical table
Subject matter, (1) production (2), delivery (3)
with the collection of all three
theoretically, 
E = emcee squared
But there's a sucka born every minute, it appears
That's 1,440 a day,
525,600 redundant rappers a year
(complex concepts)
And I'm positive as protons, 
niggas won't comprehend John
So fuck Bone, I'm bad to the chromosome
All 46 that dwell in each somatic cell
could raise more hell 
than Darryl, Jones, Rusty, or Satan
Exercise my mind
and turn fat tracks to muscle
I come from every angle
like 90 degrees in diameter
The Hemis chemist
Isolating isotopes
under microscopes
I bioengineer (Jacob's Coil???)
Let your lens focus
Through osmosis,
just standing next to me
I thought you knew (I thought you knew)
I'm the B-boy scientist
"with the high IQ"</pre>
