[L.O.G. and (Fila Phil) talking]
UTC
(9th Ward, 9th Ward)
C.T.C., Cross The Canal
(Press Park nigga, that Florida, A.L.)
We hustlin', New Orleans, down in that boot
(No doubt nigga, what comes up nigga, must come down, ward bangin', ya heard me)
(Untouchable, I'mma kick it like this)

[Chorus-Fila Phil-]
I'm ward bangin', ward bangin', everybody ward bangin'
Bullets slangin', brains hangin', y'all bringin', we bringin'
I'm ward bangin', ward bangin', everybody ward bangin'
Bullets slangin', brains hangin', y'all bringin', we bringin'

[L.O.G.]
Time to hit the streets, of the U.P.T., tip toe, creep
10th Ward, and 3rd Ward got beef, bring the heat
When we hit the streets, ????? we meet
Blood gone leak, no surrender, no defeat
No peace, shoot that Thomas got a army mob duckin' villains
Willin', to make some killin', gravefillin', cap peelin'
Bustin' shots non stop, they raided the block
One nigga got popped, its the knee he dropped
To the ground, ain't no dodgin' 50 round, clips
Bullets sting like whips, chest play, all rip
Up, what the fuck, man these niggaz got nuts
So the Mac Melph Calio tappin' my bup
And retaliate quick, to leave some wig splits
These boys done hit, ??????? is split
Out, like a drought, so its gone no doubt
So the 3rd took a route, show them boys they bout
Nuttin' but trigga play, mission his head gone
Take niggaz away, pop 'em up, chop 'em up
Bodies skunk, bodies dunk
Brains hangin', fuckin' 'round with them souljas ward bangin'

[Chorus] 2x

[Fila Phil]
I said it all started off Downtown in that 9th Ward
Some killers out that Nina respect a baller from that 7th Ward, St. Bernard
Knock a nigga head off, birds cocked back, and want to fuck with Press Park
Into a, U-haul, full of killers
Makin' niggaz bleed or straight duct tapin' niggaz, on the reala
Them boys don't play, they trigga spray
Leavin niggaz in coffins, bodies to get away
At the same time, 4th Ward niggaz, they got beef
Bustin' at them lil' niggaz every ???
Dig deep, you can't roll the streets without yo heat
Desire, they act a donkey, that Florida, they act a beast
A.L., some crazy motherfuckers that'll buck ya
Hit ya 50 times up in yo chest and make you suffer
The consequnces, found dead with no witness
Brains go to the fat, ain't nobody know who did ya
Nigga we killin' thugs, nigga we poppin' slugs
Them boys from Downtown, never did it, show no love
So niggaz thats on the run, stay strapped with tommy guns
We the ones who ??????
So what the fuck you mean, Downtown get out the way
We all about that drama, and all about that trigga play
Don't start no shit, won't be no shit
Fuckin' 'round with Downtown, ya get ya wig split
Don't start no shit, won't be no shit
Fuckin' 'round with that Nina, ya get ya wig split
Don't start no drama, won't be no drama
Fuckin' 'round with Press Park, we 'nappin ya fuckin' mama
9's rangin', bullets slangin', brains hangin', we camouflaged down
From the ward, its ward bangin'

[Chorus] 2x

[L.O.G.]
T.C., C.T.C., is the boundaries, all our enemies, unsolved mysteries
Nigga please, concrete shoes, I can't lose
Givin' niggaz the blues, puttin' niggaz on the news
Act a fool, with that tool, if you snooze, you lose
Lyrically I bruise, clans, clicks, crews
Abuse them all, 9th Ward scar, socca ball
Catch ya on falsed on, ya body get hard off
Represent it to the fullest, trigga man through bullets
At yo head, stretched, red, red, now ya dead
T-Shirts and jeans, that was all was seen
As I fled from the scene, my team, who bout that green, fiend
For paper chasin', erasin', or war, catchin' capers
Its the basic way, you gotta make it in New Orleans, a.k.a.
Soulja cemetary, many niggaz get buried, very, so often
That its scary, in my terri, tory, no mercy, no glory
Another soulja to story, be happy, don't worry
If you ain't hangin', or slangin', nigga, you ward bangin'

[Chorus] 2x

[Fila Phil and L.O.G.]
Tell them boys, they can't handle us
9th Ward scar, we hits too deep, livin' scandelous
Tell them boys, they can't handle us
9th Ward scar, we hits too deep, livin' scandelous

[Fila Phil and L.O.G. talking]

[Fila Phil and L.O.G.]
15 deep-ah, I'm finna creep-ah
We the fuckin' gangstas put you pussy niggaz to sleep-ah

15 deep-ah, I'm finna creep-ah
We the fuckin' gangstas put you pussy niggaz to sleep-ah
That 5, 4, that 5, 4, that 5, 4, that 5, 4</pre>
