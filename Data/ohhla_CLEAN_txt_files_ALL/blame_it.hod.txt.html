[Intro]
I wanna welcome y'all
to The Dena Tape

[Hodgy Beats]
Nigga I'm contagious; ain't nobody cure us
One squirrel out of many gathering more nuts
Groupie fillies gettin ran over by the tour bus
Double salad sticky icky like syr-up
Me and my drink, homey what's in your cup?
A-a-a-a-a, a-alcohol
A couple sacks extra fat, I bag 'em all
Swisher packs for the sacks I packed them off
We fly nigga, we don't relax at all
I'm on my +Ginuwine+, "So anxious!"
Cruisin 'round drunk like she know where to take us
I can see through the make-up, if she tryin to fake us
Bring me to the bank where I never go bankrupt
Got my change up though I'll never change up
I go after my moneym like a fuckin predator
I wake up to the sound of my lovely cash register

[Chorus]
Every time I see one of them chickenheads, I be like get off me
(Get off me, get off me)
Every time I see them girls in the red, I be like get off me
(Get off me, get off me)
Every time I see them chickenheads, I like man, get off me
(Get off me!)
Cause you're killin me hard (cause you're killin me hard)
You're not killin me softly (Hodgy Beats)

[Outro]
Thank you!
I mean... you're welcome
