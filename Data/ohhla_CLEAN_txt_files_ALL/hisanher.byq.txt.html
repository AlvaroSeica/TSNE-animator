[Intro: SZA]
Can I show you this world babe? (Can I show you the world?)
Ain't no rules to this night darling (No rules to this night)
(But you)
Can I show you this world, darling? (I know, I know, I know)
Ain't no rules to this night darling (I know, I know, I know)
As I focus my frame to truly adore you babe (Truly adore me, that you adore me I know)
Can I show you this world, darling? (I know, I know, I know)
Ain't no rules to this night darling (I know, I know, I know)

[Schoolboy Q]
You know Q gon drop that funky shit you know Q gon spit that real
How you not like me?
How you not love me?
How you hide your feelings?
You get hooked from the jump
It's the first of the month
We be good for the week
Won't last for the day
Just right for the night
So right for your life
Let the truth be told
Let it crush your balls
Then I'mma heal your soul like
I could make you feel good your skin, baby
I'm the blood in your heart when it pump, baby
I'mma be there with you till you turn 80 and I know
Uh, your family got so much to say, baby
I'm the thing that make pain go away, baby
When I'm warm and you sick to your tongue, baby and I know

[Chorus: SZA]
I know, I know, I know, I know
Can I show you this world babe? (Can I show you the world?)
Ain't no rules to this night darling (No rules to this night)
(But you)
Can I show you this world, darling? (I know, I know, I know)
Ain't no rules to this night darling (I know, I know, I know)
As I focus my frame to truly adore you babe (Truly adore me, that you adore me I know)
Can I show you this world, darling? (I know, I know, I know)
Ain't no rules to this night darling (I know, I know, I know)</pre>
