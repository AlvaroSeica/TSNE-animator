Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Foolish win sometimes, but it's still my birthday
Foolish win sometimes, but it's still my birthday

I know the day started off so smooth
Wiping off the cold sweat
Woke me up, it must have been a good dream
I guess however its that's why I feel like I live in a big smile
With my hands in the air

Poppa like this girl, sweet pie
More than pieces
I'm not gonna play, I know for a fact
You truly must relate to fate to 'pon the roll
Endless places, new faces, that I know forever can directing
Foolish win sometimes

Foolish win sometimes, but it's still my birthday
Lord, lord knows
Foolish win sometimes, but it's still my birthday

And she gives the lovin, you see
It's so true, me on my back up
Whatever she sees, I don't mind and I don't care
I will flow with the determined effect
The itchy biters, see not to rest, boo must resent the mess

I don't care what suzie loves
Or even what the crew really does
It's my own, and my real friends to the end
The only things that I could see, lord

Foolish win sometimes

Said I don't know which way
To keep from movin down the line
And whether soundman say
You gotta keep pushin to feel fine

I say don't give up on this world
I wanna reach for higher ground
I say don't give up on this world
I wanna reach for higher ground

The love that you see
And it's awesome for me
But them don't stop now
We remember holdin it</pre>
