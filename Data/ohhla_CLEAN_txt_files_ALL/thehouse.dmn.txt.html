Intro/Chorus:

Well we gon' start this thing on fire
(Diggy Domino's in the house tonight)
Said we gon' start this thing on fire
(Diggy Domino's in the house tonight)
Well we gon' start this thing on fire 
(Diggy Domino's in the house tonight)

Here we go, here we go, it's time to get started
Get'cha ass up on your feet
There's a new sheriff in town and so it's goin down
and I know how to make it all tick
It's been said once before that diggy Domino
can't make your body work
So just play your cards and if ya ?sweattle? more
then come on up outta your shirt
Now is it on the East Coast baby? (HO!)
Is it on the West Coast baby? (HO!)
Is it on the East Coast baby? (HO!)
Is it on the West Coast baby? (HO!) Check it out
Now I've been lit this fire, boy
Tempt me, Bo it's your turn
(We don't need no water, let Domino bring it home)

Chorus:

Well we gon' start this thing on fire
(Diggy Domino's in the house tonight)
Said we gon' start this thing on fire
(Diggy Domino's in the house tonight)
Said we gon' start this thing on fire 
(Diggy Domino's in the house tonight)
Well we gon' start this thing on fire
(Diggy Domino's in the house tonight)

Now I'ma tell you straight in the record on your face
And some may think I'm wrong
But if you ain't paid to do your thang
then take your ass on home
Cos if you know how to move then you know how to groove
Just rock until you drop
You see it ain't no party like a Domino party
cos a Domino party don't stop
Now is it on the East Coast baby? (HO!)
Is it on the West Coast baby? (HO!)
Is it on the East Coast baby? (HO!)
Is it on the West Coast baby? (HO!) Check it out
Now I've been lit this fire, boy
Tempt me, Bo it's your turn
(We don't need no water, let Domino bring it home)

Chorus

You see I got to live it up when I'm comin in the place
I knew just what it takes just to see your ass shake
So if you're from the ol' school then do what you do
and if ya square dance then you can skip-to-my-lu
Ya say ya can't damn, then that's what you say
But I can rock your body while ya screamin out "Heeeeyyy!!!"
So now ya know what it's all about
Then get that ass up cos Domino's in the house

Chorus to fade
