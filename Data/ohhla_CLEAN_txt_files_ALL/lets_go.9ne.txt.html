Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Ee Ah Oh Ah Ah
That means I love you if you got a ass
Yes, ain't no stoppin' there
Let's go, let's go if you talkin' (like a player?)

Let's go
If your sittin at home talking to him on the phone
And he aint't call without a style of his own
You wishin' that you was gone, throwin back up, what's wrong?
You aint wrong cause you'd rather be with me in the zone
Let's go
Sorry, your lady has been taken
You can find yourself in the mall with the flo' shakin'
And I aint even the one that's bringin' her home to bake in
You the one been talking bout kickin' my face in?
Let's go
You can do whateva you go to
My rebel persona, that got me dressin' red as I wanna, I had her, you're stronger
The problem is you're dead as a coma
You sickin' me, but I'm right here to put the medicine on ya
Let's go
Got 'em all frightened up, and tightened
You might be too late to get fights in with the bison
It's always 'citing, my ben's real (gelrighfin?)
I ruined your life when i produced a licencse

Let's go
Coming through the dough, hella fast, never slow, got the cash, and the pedal to the flo'
Let's go'
If you wanna ride, let me know
We can slide on the low
Whatcha standin there fo'?
Let's go
You can hate cause I'm dippin' witcha mate
Out the gate, let's roll, let's bounce, let's skate
Let's go
To the room, let's go to the left
Let's go, Your boyfriend aint talkin' 'bout shit

Post it up, squat low like a pig
And know this patrol chasing whole motion nigga shit
And i ain't gotta decide to proceed without a grip
So we can just do it movin' if it's all on the bed
Let's go
They likin' the skinny jeans and tha kicks
And Judy Wells
But I ain't in the please and the trick
I'm in the top
With porche's and keys to a set
So sit back and let the engine breathe a lil bit
Let's Go
But I'm highly in the hoochie holla are-o
Money, all the beezy's got it from my uncle Larry-o
Superstar to me when I'm playin' on your radio
Addicted to Regina when she ain't a robbin' are-o
Let's go
Cut, cutty, cowoonie's best senario
Kansas City to Oak
My folks like Big Mac's dare-o
Tell 'em it's raining game
He's soakin' up every drank
Gonna give you a party for the marry-o
DAMN

Let's go
Coming through the dough, hella fast, never slow, got the cash, and the pedal to the flo'
Let's go
If you wanna ride, let me know
We can slide on the low
Whatcha standin there fo?
Let's go
You can hate cause I'm dippin witcha mate
Out the gate, let's roll, let's bounce, let's skate
Let's go
To the room, let's go, to the left
Let's go, Your boyfriend aint talkin' bout shit

Get down, gotta get down, girl
Is you ready to roll?
Well shit, let's go
Hit that KCM straight to the O
I got that joke, sip that err
What we call it fo?
I hit that err that got that urge to knockin' on yo do
Get in this car. I'm a star, you aint noticed yet?
Look at these shoes
Look at these jewels shinin' on my neck
I spit that denim then I send em in the remover denim
And once I get 'em, then I bend 'em, and I can't remember 'em
I stay persistent and consistent when it comes to pimpin
Your hoe gets sentenced from a sentance when it comes to repentance
I go the distance when I hit your butt like I'm the midget
Position touch it, position ship it, like I ain't in it
The arms are touchin' we gonna hit that
I'm suckin' and bustin', I'm tryna hit her tat
She said her dude rang
But really he's too lame
Battlin' Tech N9NE, you know that we are too strange

Coming through the dough, hella fast, never slow, got the cash, and the peddle to the flo'
Let's go
If you want a ride, let me know
We can slide on the low
Whatcha standin' there fo?
Let's go
You can hate, cuz I'm dippin' witcha mate
Out the gate, let's roll, let's bounce, let's skate
Let's go
To the room, let's go, to the left
Let's go, your boyfriend ain't talkin' 'bout shit
Let's go</pre>
