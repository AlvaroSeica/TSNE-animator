[Chorus - Bruno]
You shot me through the heart staring in your eyes
So I might die a happy man today
Just empty out your barrel Girl, it's alright
Click Clack away (click clack away)
Click Clack away (click clack away)

Go ahead pull it, pull it, pull it
Yeah yeah pull it, pull it [2x]
Go ahead make my day
Click Clack away

[Rap - Diggy]
You got weapons of mass seduction if I was broke I give you half of nothing
I give all then I give you more I'm no decorator but the writings on the wall
Winter, Summer, Fall, April, May and June
You shot through the heart, I don't have a wound
You got a good aim cause I could of sworn I moved
When it comes to relationships I don't have a clue
Love at first sight I don know I assume
You put a hit on me badabing badaboom
If this pain let me hurry up and suffer what doesn't kill me makes my love tougher
I'm tough now, what's up now? fire at me I swear I won't duck down
Wow. You had at all you ain't have to shoot girl you had me from the draw

[Chorus - Bruno]
You shot me through the heart staring in your eyes
So I might die a happy man today
Just empty out your barrel Girl, it's alright
Click Clack away (click clack away)
Click Clack away (click clack away)

Go ahead, pull it, pull it, pull it
Yeah yeah pull it, pull it [2x]
Go ahead make my day
Click Clack away

[Rap - Diggy]
You take away my very breath, call 911marry bless, no need to ask if I'm ready yes
I go get my tux and you go get your dress and we gonna do it big although we just met
I was just being fresh yeah I know I'm a mess but I like spontaneity, continuity
Let it flow let it flow just you and me
And I'm not pressing charges
Don't want you to ricochet
And hit another target, you take me to the edge
Right into the margin all I see is fireworks I can feel it sparking, hope you keep at the center of
Your bulls eye and you its more benefits for full time you are everything in more
You ain't have to shoot girl you me from the draw

[Chorus - Bruno]
You shot me through the heart staring in your eyes
So I might die a happy man today
Just empty out your barrel Girl, it's alright
Click Clack away (click clack away)
Click Clack away (click clack away)

Go ahead pull it, pull it, pull it
Yeah yeah pull it, pull it [2x]
Go ahead make my day
