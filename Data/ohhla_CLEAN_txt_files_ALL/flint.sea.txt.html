[ VERSE 1 ]
Once upon a time in a town called Bedrock
There lived a man named Fred who ran a dopespot
He had a right hand man named Barney
And loc'ed out fools who used automatic tools in his army
Fred worked for Mr. Slate
Who owned a rock factory, but Fred rocked up cakes
And sold em at 14.3
A 4.3 profit cause Slate gets 10 g's
Fred made good bread but he was fed with the pay
And only Slate stood in his way
He had a plot for Slate which was murder
Discussed it with Barney over Brontosaurus burgers
Barney was down, he said, "Call me when you're ready
But gimme a few hours to take a shower and fuck Betty"
Fred said "Yabadabadoo, it's on"
Meet the Flintstones

[ VERSE 2 ]
Fred had a plot to get Slate over
He had porno on his Bedrock camcorder
Slate was on his way to the casino
Got flagged down by Fred's dog, name's Dino
He got persuaded by the dog's dilemma
When he heard on the porno was Betty and Wilma
Slate got to the house and didn't see a thing
He was shot, heard the cock of a M-16
Blew his whole head off, poor Mr. Slate
Barney rolled him in a rug, then dumped him off in a lake
But Fred didn't know one thing
Before Slate came he gave the Buffalos a ring
And said he'd stop by Fred's for a minute
And be at the casino as soon as he's finished
But Slate never showed up, Mr. Slate's gone
And the Buffalos is trippin - meet the Flintstones

[ VERSE 3 ]
Now Fred and Barney run a rock factory
And the pockets are past satisfactory
Barney bought Bam-Bam a ride
A stone Mercedes with 4 12's inside
Because of the stone the beat sounded like treble
Gettin head from Fred's daughter, name's Pebbles
It was dark, all you saw was sparks from the guage
He was slippin cause the head had him in a daze
The Buffalos was deep in a Chevy
Lookin for Barney, but they only found Betty
Kidnapped the bitch, pistolwhipped her with a gat
Said, "We only askin once, where the fuck are they at?"
Scary-ass bitch snitched in a hurry
Said Fred and Barney was down in the quarry
They tied the bitch up and put two in her dome
Now the Buffalos is headed for the quarry - meet the Flintstones

[ VERSE 4 ]
Now Fred and Barney heard the bad news
The Water Buffalos was out payin dues
Fred said, "We ain't goin out like punks"
Grabbed the 50-shot K and Barney grabbed the pump
Dumpin on the Buffalos meeting hall
Barney yellin, "One for one, nigga, all for all"
Sideways, headin straight back to the spot
But they didn't know the Buffalos were posted on the block
Glocks cocked, soon as they spotted them, they got at them
Tryin to drop them, tryin to pop them
With M-16's and A.R.-15's
Tried to peel their cap with sub-Uzi machines
Barney caught a couple straight in the face
And Fred tried to make a run for the cash and the cakes
But he got rattled by the bullets as he stepped out the Brougham
And that's the end of the Flintstones</pre>
