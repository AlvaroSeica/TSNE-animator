[Intro: Vinnie Paz]
Yeah, hahahaha
Yo Kwest you killin them on the beat cousin
Let these motherfuckers know, yeah!

[Chorus 2X: scratches of "Last Dayz" by Onyx]
"Thinkin 'bout takin my own life, I might as well"
"That's where I'm goin cause the devil's inside of me"
"Thinkin 'bout takin my own life - yeah, that's where I'm goin"
"'Cept they might not sell weed in hell"

[Vinnie Paz]
See I always have respect cause I always talk facts
The .38 and .50-caliber hawk black
I always left with nothin but I always brought back
I always been a hustler, I probably go off that
Yeah, y'all don't wanna go to work with the boy
It's only two words that describe me: search and destroy
I don't think you wan' get murked by the boy
My shit is military, y'alls is like a nursery toy, it's hurtin you boys
(BRRAP!) My team ain't even hungry, we famished
I murder everybody, fuck collateral damage
I'm animal savage with Hannibal's habits, I'll mangle your cabbage
I walked into the barracks and I strangled the faggots
I hang with the baddest, brothers put they trust into Jesus
Run with brothers who's forty guzzlers, Islamic extremists
Ugly and ignorant is how they perceive us
I don't care, I'm tryin to deal with my personal demons

[Chorus] w/ "That's where I'm goin" at the end of second repeat

[Vinnie Paz]
Y'all don't wanna go that route
Broke muh'fucker need to throw his throwback out
If you see me drinkin somethin good I stole that stout
If you see me drinkin in the hood then roll back out
On the real I don't want no one to bother me cousin
Rappin just a little fuckin bit a part of me cousin
I'm just tryin to have a drink at the bar with my cousin
I ain't mean to be rude God, pardon me cousin (pardon self God)
I stay strapped Lord, gun in the tuck
Young bulls act wild Lord, funny as fuck (they funny style)
I scrap southpaw, sonnin you fucks
Look at you Lord, on the floor bummy as fuck, what~?
My life been defined by death
So I guess if everybody dead mine is next
My father dropped a jewel on me, time forgets
It's not as easily the mind forgets - ya mean?

[Chorus]

[Vinnie Paz]
+Drag You to Hell+, I'm +Evil Dead+, you can call me Sam Raimi
These muh'fuckers want a verse but they can't pay me
Fuck a funeral home, put 'em in the sand maybe
Y'all are actin like you're big like your man gravy
Y'all don't wanna beef with the God (y'all don't want beef)
Don't have the brain power to compete with the God (nah)
Y'all should retreat from the God
Before you get turned to meat, somethin to eat for the God
Peace to the Gods
I carry heavy shit, big guns, John Rambo
I'ma spot Russia like Pakistani commandos
How you goin to war when you standin in sandals?
Now you dead and your family handlin candles
Don't even call for a truce
I'm about to end this whole muh'fucker when I call for the troops
Reservoir dog walk with the troops
And I'll burn this muh'fucker down to the ground down to its roots

[Chorus] w/ "That's where I'm goin" at the end of second repeat
