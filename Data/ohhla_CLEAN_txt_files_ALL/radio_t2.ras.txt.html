(*talking*)
You getting this, it's live in the beat
Dude it's O.G. Ron C, turn it up
Ha-ha, it's Rasaq boy yeah

[Rasaq]
When I tip down I chunk the deuce, sipping on a cup of juice
Screens hanging from the roof, realest nigga in the booth
Flashy nigga in the coupe, diamond display on my tooth
Leather seats up on my cheek, feeling like a butt massuse
Niggaz rap like Dr. Seuess, talking down like they the truth
Niggaz ain't even feeling you, they trying to get a ounce and move
Low pro's around my shoes, 4-4's around my dudes
Make the wrong move for my jewels, and my niggaz'll down you fools
Boys talking plenty noise, when they come around they crew
Do my dirt all by my lonely, black on black with 22's
Who you know that break a stack, spend it all and make it back
Most niggaz from around the way, sell dope and hate to rap
Niggaz think they thugged out, cause they hair is braided back
Till I hit you lay you flat, you's a trick I say you whack
Northside my habitat, play with me I ain't having that
Boys is like them Air Force Ones, mid-top I'm staying strapped</pre>
