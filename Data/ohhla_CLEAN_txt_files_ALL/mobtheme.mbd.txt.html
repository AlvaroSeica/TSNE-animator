[KLC]
Yeah (yeah)
Three niggas in the broad.
Serv did his side of the story so I guess I'm gonna.
And it go a little somethin like this.

Once upon a time not long ago
Bumped into my cuz in the commotion show
Bro trippin' with the broads in the Bayou classic
Eyes do the problem, make you stop in Dallas
Low and behold, we hit the club called spot
Ten minutes on the scene and I hear about three shots
Scared as the pluckem checkin' around for blood
Hoping none of these slugs hit one of my bruds
So my cousin stops me at the aftermath
Gold teeth shinin' like a psychopath
He was looking for some beats so he could pull a keeper
I'm like "Hell yeah, let's make some paper"

[Mo B. Dick - Chorus]
Bitches call me Mo B, niggas call me Dick
You may call me crazy or you may call my silly
I am just a gangster who likes to rock the mic
Promising you haters, I'll shoot your ass tonight

[KLC]
Yo Dick, you wanna know some funny shit?
I'll be worked for three niggas in the broads.
And locked five niggas in the pound.
Bumpin' down this platinum shit.
Now let 'em know what happen after that broad got shot.

So I fly out to Cali to persue my dream
All I had was twenty dollars and a drum machine
But I wasn't even trippin' cause I'm had like that
Serv and C picked me up in the Cadillac
Now it's off to K-Lou's so we can get shit started
Dropped Fuck Them hoes with my first recording
Puttin' in work every ten that day
All day every day, that's how we make that pay
Move back to the booths so we can touch our roots
Eat red beans and rice and coffee stew
Say what you want, but this is who I be
Tank Dogg, No Limit, DPGC

[Mo B. Dick - Chorus]
Bitches call me Mo B, niggas call me Dick
You may call me crazy or you may call my silly
I am just a gangster who likes to rock the mic
Promising you haters, I'll shoot your ass tonight

[KLC]
Yeah, Mo B. Dick, KL.
The Pound, Craig B, O'Dell, Los.
We in here, No Limit 2000. We out.
