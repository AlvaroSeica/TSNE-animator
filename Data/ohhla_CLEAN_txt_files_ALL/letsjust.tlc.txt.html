[Lisa Lopes]
Uh Yeah, Come on

[Missy Elliott]
I like this

[Lisa Lopes]
Lets just do it

[Missy Elliott]
Whoop

[Lisa Lopes]
See when I wanna do something I just do what I feel you know what Im
saying, I just do it straight from the heart
So we can do it and do it

[Missy Elliott]
Lets go

[Verse 1: Lisa Lopes]
Nobody ever understood me better, a true friend forever
That's why Im writing you this love letter
Despite my ways, through every phase
You brought me better days, we stood the craze
From the beginning windy hill the black linen
When I was sagging denim and let you get up in em
Until I damage when I selected another niggaa but we managed to stay
connected
When you expected to see me naked
I couldn't let it 5 years and you still respect it
Now check it
Give me a second to unwind you'll find all the pain and misery it nearly
blew my mind
Gain no fame and chivalry compared Im losing time Ill explain my history
aboard the cruise at 9
Don't be late cause I would hate to cross the seven seas, in the windy
breeze without your fantasies
Lets do it

[Chorus: T-Boz and Chilli]
Lets Just Do It Do It Do It Do It Do It Oh Yeah
Lets Just Do It Do It Do It Do It Do It Oh Yeah
Let's Just Do It
Lets Just Do It Do It Do It Do It Do It Oh Yeah
Lets Just Do It Do It Do It Do It Do It Oh Yeah

[Verse 2: Missy Elliott]
See I am the E-E-L-L-I-O-T-T
They call me Missy-E
 I'm C-U-T-E you like the way I do it
I put my foot into it
Tell them haters they mad they cant do it like I do it
They used to call me fat
they used to say
I'm ugly, but now Im making records groupies screaming that they love me
I got them dollar bills I make a lot of cheese but you cant do it like me.

When you see me in the club Im looking fresh and
When you see me on the street Im looking fresh and
When you see me all the time Im looking fresh
I got my hair and my nails done Im so fresh baby

[T-Boz and Chilli]
