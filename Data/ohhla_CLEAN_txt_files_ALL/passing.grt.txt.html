*hook*
El tiempo esta passando
El tiempo esta...
(Is it all yours, time is passing away. time is passing away)

*bonafide*
My chronological line
Was designed by the divine
At times my minds vision
Was found to be blind
Sometimes I felt like
I lived life with eyes sown up
Nothing but sounds and voices
Surrounding me within the blackness
Walking cautiously
Only God guiding me
Abiding in me
Independently I fail myself
Images of my history
Is haunting at times
Taunting at times
Confronted most times
How is spent mines
Tempted frequently
To feed the need
Of past relations
Found struggling attaining more scars
Through inner battling
Wondering will I make it
Plundered through ways to shake it
Remembering what was written
My only method
To break it
Being locked in this life
connected to christ
His will and my destiny
My reason and purpose for birth in life
For a minute was contended
With whatever was presented
If it's sin
I was in it
In the flesh represented
Supressing truth in which was hid
In my spirit ignoring guidance
Rebelling against His voice
With choices in pure defiance
Then I asked myself
Was it designed to be mine
If so
I found I wasted the blessing
Of precious time

*coffee*
Perpetrated me
A serious fraud
So don't applaud
Feeling sawed in two
Part of me scattered all about
With the other half
Appearing and domineering
My steering
Mentality of bangbanger
To topple my dopple ganger
With excessive force
No doubting
While re-routing course bouting
What might endorse
Waters of hell, just to prevail
"Don't fail"
The voice saying magically
What tragedy entail
The terror won't take my will
To conquer error
When the time has passed and gone
The ending will be
"Me at home"
I brought it to you plainly
(Just like that)
Don't let it pass you by
(Just like that)
Time is ticking away
(Just like that)
Uh-huh uh-huh
(Just like that)

*hook*

*coffee*
What's my passion?
I love to see people hashing
Thru all life's problems
Whatever it has to offer
Situations come
Do you face it
Do you run
Look it right between the eyes
Succumb and be Hypnotized</pre>
