[Hook]
"She was my baby"
Damn right she was
"But she put me down"
Oh well, now I'm moving up and I'm moving out

[Verse 1]
And I, still sleep on one side of the bed
And I, can't sleep so I'm tired instead
Trying to, set free what's wired to my head
Short circuit circulating with each breath
And, she left with a convincing stride
Spread them wings effortless and let it fly
Glide, like, there was never any drama
And I won't watch when the wind gets calmer
I'm gonna find my spot many mornings after
Contact lost so I can sort through the data
Wonder what you're up to since the departure
Hope we both learn to play it smarter
I'ma have a harder shell to crack
So when the walls all crumble, I'm numb to the impact
Six pack flowing through the bubbling veins
In the winter they will simmer in a troublesome gain
The future without me, that's not one in the same
You didn't see a future with me, not one in the same
So move on...

[Hook - x2]
