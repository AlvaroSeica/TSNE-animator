Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Picture me flying down the highway
Rolling my way I can sit and marinate
But why should I stay just roll
Could never be still it seems I am always on the go
One day at a time I vision everything in slow mo

That's how I kept it always and I won't change
I can stand here like a statue but have no game to grow
Could never be still it seems I'm always on the go
One day at a time I vision everything in slow mo

Capitol I - to the man to the land is where I navigate you
Hit your city then we make moves
Every county every state too
We bake and take the cake too
The effects that suffocate you
Handle business on my way through
When I leave it don't mean I hate you
Nomadically, no matter where I be
It will be with me I mean musically
I stay on game because I'm choosing to be
Coming out the system when your cruising the streets
Slightly Stoopid and the band CE
World wide most definitely
Hang around here what you expecting from me
When I am gone later on you will be checking for me

People can take me the wrong way
Call it a night from a long day till it's gone hey
Pass me a bottle of that Bombay
But I hate it when it feels like a Monday
But I can't stay I got to stick and move
Be ready in this case they switch the rules
Get it off my chest with the SS crew
That could never be me but I guess that is you
Different strokes for different faces
Spacious skies stay high and gracious
Patience makes us feel tired and wasted
Came so close I can almost taste it
Switch it up once and change the game plan
Put in on you like a Nike name brand
Till you give it up and let respect change hands
It will never be the same man</pre>
