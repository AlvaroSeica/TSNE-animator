[Shyne]
Close your eyes and turn off the lights
Listen to the words that this author writes
Seen so much, so many parts of life
Darker life, wrongs only God can right
Think back when I was loose, rollin around
Insurrection 'bout to gun some down
Didn't care 'bout no rap career cat
You violate - I go twist your bare cap
Yeah - I've gotten blessed that night in that club
Nobody died from that slug
I think about the way that I was
I tell ya I was on one, cuz
'Bout to catch a few bodies, woulda probably caught the chair
First album y'all would never got to hear
Huh - I can't believe that I'm here
I should've been buried with my peers

[Chorus]
Close your eyes and turn off the lights
Been suffering all my life
Listen to the words that this author writes
Close your eyes and turn off the lights
And listen to the words that this author writes

[Shyne]
I guess e'rything happens for a rhyme and reason
Still don't excuse the lyin and treason
You could face 100 years in the precinct
Keep your mouth closed, ain't no speakin
When you in the streets, this is how it goes
Police ask you say you don't know
Make sure the witness all follow same code
Death before dishonor 'til they take away your soul
I need to know, how my co-d
Called witness to sacrifice me
Just so he, can get away free
This does not comply with the streets
But he ain't from there
This is not a smear
This is what they fear
The whole truth, I swear

[Chorus]
Close your eyes and turn off the lights
Listen to the words that this author writes
Close your eyes and turn off the lights
Man, wrongs only God can right

[Shyne]
Look -  one thing about me, I was never naive
I might've played dumb to get what I need
But I could see, who was he
Nothin ain't surprise me about this creep
Ha, I'm from the land of the East
All up in the streets
Man mi nuh skin teeth
Eyes wide shut, shotta don't sleep
Look, I seen the plot
What he did to Mason he did to LOX
What he did to Wolf and he did to Ock
God bless the dead, Notorious PAC
Why would I think that I was different?
So I just, I sat in the distance
Kept my mouth closed, looked and listened
Learned all the trades of the sharks and fishes

[Chorus]
Ha - turn off the lights
Suffering all my life
Wrongs only God can right

[Shyne]
I got partners to go to jail for body the man caught
Get shot, know who shot him? I won't testify in court
This kid got millions, that's how he talks
Shoulda took that paper, made his soul walk
Talkin 'bout he ain't responsible for my actions
Man, if I was yappin
The world would knew what happened
Them kids was about to wrap him
Shyne, they should thank him
But nooooo, they hate him
I hope I ain't rambling
Y'all got questions, I'm just answerin

[Chorus]
Close your eyes and turn off the lights
And listen to the words that this author writes
Suffering all my life
Man, wrongs only God can right

[Shyne]
Alpo did it to Rich, Brutus did it to Caesar
Throughout history, the thing is repeated
In a world where Sammy the Bull is leaders
Frank Lucas's and Joseph Massino's
Nooooo, that ain't my world
All I got is my, and my word
Until the electric chair burns, I don't bend, I don't turn
You ain't to blame for the witness you called
To say it was me, nah that ain't your fault
The lawyers you paid, I mean that you bought
To sacrifice me in open court, ha~!
I moved on
I promise no more songs
Blood, I wish you well
Ha, now watch me sell
Thank you, thank you, thank you</pre>
