[Verse 1: Eso]
So ladies and gentelman, friends and crews 
I came here to represent and vent my views 
See they want you brainwashed like everyone's for the money 
While we want the scene to blow like cherry bombs in the dunny 
So check it out this is Eso on the mic 
No Fuckin' around I came to get you in the vibe 
Grab life by the balls and never look behind 
'Cause when that bling bling dies you can bet I'll be alive 

[Verse 2: Bliss]
A revolution of radical rebels writing raw, reflect the rap 
of this cataclysmic cool calm collected cat 
The front row covered when I'm spittin' the rhyme spray 
Got skeletons on stage playin' rickety steinsways 
I sit with the owls, flippin' the mouth, flippin' the vowels 
The midnight paddock runner who's tippin the cows 
Spittin it foul, down and dirty 'cause my crew's shabby 
All I want's my girl, beer, a used caddy and this dudes happy 

[Hook: Bliss] {X2}
Well you heard about the boys from the foreign land 
They gonna stroll across the globe with the mic in their hand
And they be puttin' it down the only way they know how 
So sing it, "la la la la la la la la"

[Verse 3: Bliss]
From the moment the show starts and we emerge when the curtains break 
Your chest starts burnin' like you're slurpin' the bourbon straight 
We blow the spot with more heat we servin' than a fernace makes 
Percolate this bitch until we certain every person shakes 
The bim bam boogieman is drinkin' 'til I'm plastered 
All over your ears, rappin' swingin from the rafters 
Got asses leavin' the seat when I'm freakin' the beat 
Just husslin' like Larry Flint with the freedom of speech 

[Eso]
So while it seems like there's millions of cats that stack loot 
My crews here to stay like tax and tattoos 
And theres no match for the kid that blows your mind 
'Cause beatin' me's like me returnin' videos on time 
and the music I make is like peakin' on a trip 
Call me Jimmy Open Doors, day dreamin' with a spliff 
Puttin pressure on the player tryin' to look like the cool guy 
But couldn't come close if he spoofed on the bulls eye 

[Hook] {X2}

[Bridge: Bliss]
See they tried to put it down but up jumped the boogie [X7]
So sing it, "la la la la la la la la"
