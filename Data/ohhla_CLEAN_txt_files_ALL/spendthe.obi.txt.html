[Intro: Obie]
BME, Obie Trice
All I need is 1440 minutes wit'chu baby
Drey Skonie c'mon

[Chorus: Drey Skonie] + (Obie)
Tell me what you want (what you want)
You can have it babe (you can have it)
It don't matter, what it is
Girl you can have your way (it's your way baby)
And I don't care 'bout money
I'll spend it anyway (it's what we do)
Just imagine what I'd do for you
Just spend the day with meeeeeeeeee, ohhhh
Spend the day with meeeeeeeeee, ohhhh
Just spend the day with me

[Obie Trice]
What the problem is? Ain't it obvious?
Got a thing for ya, we need to handle biz
Take you to the crib, play with your esophagus
Get your nose snotty, eyes watery
I just wanna party wit'cha, got the party bus
We doin 1800 shots, all of us
You bring the honeys, I can bring hustlers
And we can muster up conversation to discuss
And I'ma put it in your brain, like you're readin Zane
Jumpin off my skyscraper, you ain't die in vain
You came and became, my lil' mama
Miss do anything, no drama
Runs in your stockings, no comma
When we encounter you appreciate kitchen counters
Alls I need is 24 hours
Watch Obie show you that the world's ours

[Chorus]

[Obie Trice]
Say she love my aura, how my hustle unfold
Way I hurt 'em with the yay, she call me Amber Rose
Pretty toes, no pimples, no blotch
No Proactiv, nope, the girl's hot
They rolled the carpet, whenever that the girl's out
Make sure it's Red, cause I made sure her Bottoms are
My bottom broad, you could catch us at the bar
No tops on the bottles, exactly how the models are
You know I'll put your ass together like a model car
Now your head's gettin big, if you follow us
on Twitter with Venus and Serena
Then Trice do the servin, whenever he's between her
Cause Obie-GYN
You say you're bi-curious then bring yo' friends
And we can get it in 'til, ante-meridian
Wake up, roll over then we do it again
C'mon~!

[Chorus]</pre>
