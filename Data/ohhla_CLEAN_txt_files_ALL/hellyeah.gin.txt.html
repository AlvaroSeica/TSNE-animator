[R. Kelly]
Chitty chitty bang bang boom like a pow
Everybody off in the club getting wild
Drinks everywhere the crowd is real loud
Looks like we gone be hear for a while
I'm so drunk I'm just droolin at the mouth
Trying to get somebody to take me to my house
Now where my car keys at, and where my money at
I'ma follow yall till the hour where the honeys at
give me some cheese egg steak and gritz
then hit the after party with gen and em boys clipse
whoo whoo whooo
look out for the po po
whoo whoo whooo
smoking on the tro tro

And them Air Force Ones and that all white brand new tee
Plus I get these jewel honies tryin to juke on me
You've got the occasion and girl I've got the key
It's the pie-ete piper so people follow me

[Baby]
Hey hey hey hey
So fresh, so fly, so sweet, so polite
So much, too many, cuz we ridin? tonight
Well, it?s that pimp talk that ain?t that pimp walk
It?s big pimpin? over here, player, that just started
See, we fresh with Air Ones, Lexus and big drums

[Ginuwine] Chips, Willie Chicks, Willie crisp, big fun

[Baby]
Ma, you worry none, the minks come with the guns
Prada, the Gucci, it?s all in Bird fun

[Ginuwine]
I'm sittin in my truck, snakin the club out
Kill this sip then go wild the fuck out
Up in the club with my hands in the air
There's so much shit in the atmosphere
So girl, quit frontin and get you're ass over here
And get yourself a cup of this Crown and Belvedere
I'm all off in the corner 100 honeys takin pics
They be in the VIP with lots of chicks
I'm pimped out now, low cut, and a pick
G and Big Tymers together, thats what Im talkin

[Hook]
Have you ever seen the thug in the club with a bottle turned up
Head bobbin like hell, yeah
Have you ever seen the chick in the club with a drink in the cup
Booty shakin like hell, yeah
Have you seen those Big Tymers pull up in the front of the club
Twenty-fours like hell, yeah
Have you ever seen 50 thousand strong with their hands in the air
Up and down like hell, yeah

[Malice]
Ohh what, It's on me? Let's go
I'm in the club with it on me, homie
and homie you don't know me I don't want it
I just wanna find a wodie to go home with
Not hold the phone with
Spend money on the chick I'm on, gotta have her own shit
And no Im never lonely or alone without that chome
And I only keep it on me just incase we don't click
Don't confuse the club atmosphere
With strapped in here
This just might explain malice's lack of fear

[Pusha T]
55 thousand prada pink wrist
2 years ago never picture this
Raise up the Cris'
Watch the bottle shake up
Rolled it like it was dipped in foundation make up
Na maa this is not yah jake-up
This is what ya call presidential cake up
Shake ya moneymaker until the night break up
then be on your way as soon as your ass wake up

[Hook - Ginuwine] 2x
Have you ever seen the thug in the club with a bottle turned up
Head bobbin like hell, yeah
Have you ever seen the chick in the club with a drink in the cup
Booty shakin like hell, yeah
Have you seen those Big Tymers pull up in the front of the club
24s like hell, yeah
Have you ever seen 50 thousand strong with their hands in the air
Up and down like hell, yeah
