[Intro: Random]
Merry Christmas! Ho ho ho ho
Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night

[Chorus]
Oh, I got a real good feelin
that this gonna be the best Christmas
No fightin, no fussin, no stealin
I'ma get everything on my wish list

[Random]
Dear Santa, I been on my best behavior
I brush before bedtime, I play nice with the neighbors
I keep my room spotless and I wash up of the dishes
I share with my brothers and I stick up for my sisters
I take out the trash when it isn't my turn to
I come in the house 4 minutes before curfew
Finish all my dinner even when I don't enjoy it
Do whatever I'm told but my parents ignore it
But they told me that you - know when I'm awake
And you know when I'm asleep and know when I'ma make mistakes
and when I don't so I am totally sure
Cause I see it every-time that we go to the store
It's the same thing I've wanted for the past two seasons
So I know I deserve it, I'm past due even
I signed the letter in my best manuscript
Sat it next to the ginger snaps and cold milk, cause

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

[Random]
First a brand new bike, on my wish list
And some brand new Nikes, on my wish list
A couple video games, on my wish list
Even a herringbone chain, on my wish list
You won't find no socks, on my wish list
or no turtleneck tops, on my wish list
And no corduroy pants, on my wish list
Nu-uh~! Not a chance, on my wish list
I know what musta happened the previous years
I was scribbling too fast, you couldn't read it too clear
So even though I asked for the Jordans with patent leather
You mistook it for a request for a stack of sweaters
It's all good, I take the blame for the mishap
That this year will be better than last year's, dig that!
It'll be heavensent; I even ripped the page
out of the Sears Catalog for you for reference

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

[Random]
A new stereo set, on my wish list
Some new jeans and sweats, on my wish list
Comic books and kicks, on my wish list
A little loot for flicks, on my wish list
I didn't put any ties on my wish list
Penny loafers, any size, on my wish list
Those Superman long johns, on my wish list
I been working a long time, on my wish list

[Outro]
Signed, Raheem (ho ho ho ho)
Aight, all done (ho ho ho ho)
What was that? Pssh whatever</pre>
