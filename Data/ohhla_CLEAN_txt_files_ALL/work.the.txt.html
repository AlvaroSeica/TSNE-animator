[Intro: Solomon Childs]
Yeah, you know
Niggaz keep talkin' bout
Theodore this, and Theodore that
Niggaz need to stop worryin' about the Theodore
Worry about your muthafuckin' self

[Chorus: Solomon Childs]
From the door, you gotta put in that work
Rep your work, move that work
Apply that work, kill or get hurt
Eastside, hear the adrenaline, dirty

[Solomon Childs]
Money make the world go round
Here, muthafuckas can't fuck with me, pound for pound
We only got one life to live, so I need a gangsta bitch
A ratchet with a big kick, captain of my own ship
Cuz fake niggaz dream too much
And talk too much shit, do it sound like I'm playin'
With you muthafuckas, go 'head, me squeeze like Smucker's
This ain't a gimmick, for me to get on
Do an R&amp;B remix with P. Diddy and R. Kelly
I don't know those muthafuckas
You see me in the club, high poster
Never who that, see me on the block with the roaster
Never who that, see me in somethin' pretty and big with the chauffeur
Never who that, model type, tipsy on the side of the coaster
Uptowns, white on white, valor suits, the color of _mocha
Upstate New York, ran with the trademark, the kid poker
I ain't talkin' bout a card game, talkin' bout blood on your face frame

[Chorus]

[Solomon Childs]
You bitch ass niggaz, you ass cheeks, and it reeks
Like the smell of dead Mafia, at the bottom of creeks
Mahonda speaks, that the true Messiah is speaked
This the first year of the future, walk with me, little nigga
Order to my people, people to my order
And pull myself together with the thought of a flat five
For manslaughter, I'm prepared to lead nations
From Muslims, to Bloods, to Masons
Music to guide killas through out dreams
Of self destruction, 20-05 eruption
Get the drop on, who cousin? I believe in guns hustling
Blood in your mouth, mumbling
Misinformation is the height of ignorance
That invites disaster and suffering
To blow a whole through the fader
Theodore Unit AKA the Al Qadea

[Chorus]</pre>
