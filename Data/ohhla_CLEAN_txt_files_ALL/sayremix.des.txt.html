[Timbaland]
Heh-he, yeah
You want me to say your name, right?
Alright, uh, uh

1 Â– [Destiny's Child]
    (Ooh) You better say my name
    (Ooh) Cause something feels strange
    (Ooh) Oh my man will complain
    (Ooh) I'm just asking you to say my name

[Beyonce'][Timbaland]
(Hey what's up yo?)
See usually when I call you
You say "Hey baby" oh
(What'cha talking 'bout)
But now this time
You're only mumbling to me, oh yeah
(You can't hear me, alright)
I know it ain't me something seems funny
(Naw ain't nothing going on)
So tell me now
Forever, hold your peace
(Tell you what? What'cha talking bout?)
Is that a girl I hear next to you, ooh?
Don't make me come and crash your party, baby
(Na-uh don't do that)
The game is on so I know you ain't leaving, leaving
(It's almost over though)
On my way unless I hear you say, oh baby
(Hold on don't come, don't come)

Repeat 1

[Beyonce'](Timbaland)
Oh (Yo what'cha doing later?)
Why does it feel like you're trying to rush me
(Well now you know I wouldn't do that girl, come on now)
And don't leave the room I hear it getting quiet, oh yeah
(You hear that TV in tha background)
I still remember when you tried to on me
(Oh your girl tried it on him right?)
So tell the truth I wish you'd quit trying to play these game, oh
(You trippin' now)
It's about to be over if I can't come over
(You can come over in a little while, not right now)
Boy you must think I'm a fool or something
(I think you're the smartest girl in the world come on now)
Listen at your voice, see you're sounding shady
(I sound calm like I always do what's up?)
Then prove it to me and let me hear you say my name, oh
(I'm saying now baby)

Repeat 1

[Destiny's Child]
Say my name
Something ain't the same
You're homie paged
Boy you've been acting kind of strange
Say my name
Something's done changed
I'm not absurd
I'm waiting for you to explain
Say my name
Something ain't the same
You're homie paged
Boy you've been acting kind of strange
Say my name
Save the games
I'm just asking you to say my name

[Timbaland](Beyonce')
What I'mma do baby is get off this phone
(Oh yeah-yea-yeah)
Cause I see you trippin' right now
(Oh yeah-yea-yeah, yeah)
Give you some time to yourself
Let you think a little bit
(Oh yeah-yea-yeah, yeah)
I hope you change your mind right about now

[Beyonce']
Say my name, say my name
When no one is around you
Say "Baby, I love you"
If you ain't running games
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kind of shady
In callin' me baby
Why the sudden change?
Say my name, say my name
When no one is around you
Say "Baby, I love you"
If you ain't running games
Say my name, say my name
Say my name, yeah
Say my name, say my name</pre>
