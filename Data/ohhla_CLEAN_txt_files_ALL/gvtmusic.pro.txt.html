Well I got things to do
And people got things to say
Said I got work to do
And the people find time to play

Babylon system is stuck in a slow modem
Why yall persisting to fuck with the Promoe when
No rapper that rise against me shall ever prosper
Rhymes written in the bible, revolutionary rasta
Take an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth
I tell a lie for a lie and a truth for a truth
I spit a line after line over loop after loop
To make your mind intertwine with brain food at the root
Cus we all gotta eat but I ain't sellin' my soul
Cus man can't live by them belly alone
I'm hard to reach trust no cellular phones
Cus the government agents wanna follow we 'round
Electronic transmittors picked up by satelites
I'm writing rhymes in a room lit up by candle lights
And I'm spittin... in the wind, of changin' times
In the name of unchaining minds

[Chorus]
All of a sudden when you sick
Off all of that government music
Just call and I'll come with that new shit
Just call if you love revolutions
Call on this sub level nuisance
Ball you could bloody well lose it
Come on call if you run with a crew which
Is armed with a gun and a full clip

Pointed at the business give me points and tour support
And creative control or end up in the war report
Us against them David versus Goliath
I'm bustin' at them aim at jerks with cold fire
Old pirates rob I of my songs of freedom
Songs that we've done Promoe comes from Sweden
Needn't no further introduction
In a world of wack music my shit serve as interruptions
Short breaks from a reality that's really unreal
Where record companies want you to sign a dumb deal
Then they're swallowing your following like a bottle in a fridge
They suck you dry and leave your body in a ditch
They steal your golden days then when you're old and grey
They done found new blood to mold and clay
And if you're bold and play make sure you read the terms
A life long contract till you feed the worms

[Chorus]

Yo you can call me on the 1-800 hotline
Listen closely go out and cop mine
Or you the type to drop dimes and call the cops? fine
Bring your glocks, nines ain't nothing can stop mine
Though life is one big road with alot of stop signs
And I carry a big load as long as I rock rhymes
I do not mind, the bullshit: behind
Love will conquer all evil
It's easier for Heavy D to enter through the eye of a needle
Than for the government to be buying my people
Your smile is deceitful, plastic, colgate white
Get it smashed if your flow ain't tight
Now if that happen to me I'd spit blood on the tracks
Till it's cluttered with facts and women cuddle the wax
Love to the max physical and spiritual
Natural, lyrical miracle

[Chorus]

Well I got things to do
And people got things to say
Said I got work to do
And the people find time to play</pre>
