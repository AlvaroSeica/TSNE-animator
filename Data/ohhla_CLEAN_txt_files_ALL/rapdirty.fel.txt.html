"Dirty"
"Rap dirty" (Rap dirty, yeah)
"Rap dirty" (All right)
"Rap dirty" (Hey yo)

[Verse 1: A.L.T.]
Baby, won't you spend some time with me
Let me take you home and sixty-nine with me
Let me get you wet like a slip and slide
Because I'm hittin' front and back, and side to side
Like a rag top Impala, three wheel motion
Let's take a trip to the west coast ocean
I say the rhymes to keep the home girls clappin'
Sand on my balls and nut sack's slappin'
Baby, do you wanna fuck
Cause if not, Slow Pain got some pussy in the truck
And I ain't even tryin' to beg like Benji
Bitches be down three deep fuck frenzy
After the show, where you wanna go
I promise you bitch, I won't call you a hoe
But if you real good, I swear I'm a call you back
Cause it's like that
I can rap dirty

[Tony G.]
"Rap dirty"
"Rap dirty"
"Rap dirty"
"Rap dirty"

[Verse 2: Slow Pain]
Hoppin' in a six-three, up and down in the back seat
Dumpin' money sign hickeys on a super freak
Climbin' on this night club trick
A bitch is a bitch, I'm from the long weenie click
So many hoes always asking my name
I'm in a player's game, and all the pussy's the same, yeah
It smells like fish, but it tastes like chicken
When you pimpin'
It's all finger lickin'
So, do it, the head boppin'
Let me hear you scream if you think you bed rockin'
Just another 3D porno show
X-rated nympho, the pants comin' slow
To all you gangsta girls across the land, like Mr. Troutman
I Wanna Be Your Man, hah
As I, hoe hop along in a '39 bomb
Slow Pain raps dirty

[Tony G.]
"Rap dirty"
"Rap dirty"
"Rap dirty"
"Rap dirty"

(Verse 3)
[Slow Pain]
Can I get a ho, ho, I'm in the mix
Room 69, I be's the Need-A-Freak-Fix
Serve for them hoes, puttin' in overtime
Baby, you the shit, so won't you please (???) mine
Puffin' on a El Camino, that's a Slow Pain drug
Oh baby, can I get a little love
I feel like some Sexual Healin'
Love Between The Sheets, give me the good, good feelin'

[A.L.T.]
Hey yo, Slow
Peep out this bitch in the front row
Tryin' to come off like a high class hoe
Seventeen'll get you three to five
So step off bitch, I'll give your mama a ride, I'm
Twenty-four with the six inch dick
But that don't mean shit cause I can lick
I'll call your bluff if you wanna act flirty
Three deep clique comin' through
And we can rap dirty

[Tony G.]
"Rap dirty"
