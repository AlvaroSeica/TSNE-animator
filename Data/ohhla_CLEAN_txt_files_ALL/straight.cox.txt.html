Vast (talking; Vordul in [])
Yo, yo [what]
Def Jux, cipher unknown [this is hard right here]
Co-Flow what the deal? [this is Brooklyn right here]
This on fire right now [this is east, this is west]
3rd degree [what]

(Vast Air Kramer)
Yo, I been nice but you rather put your hat in your sleeve
And break arms like Segaul, don't wear your heart on your sleeve
There's two things in life; fact and belief
Yea, and you best to believe, it's a fact I just rolled the leaf
Def Jux don't care about your culture or creed
Or the color you bleed, and it be Ox versus aliens
All you see is martians piled up
That's jiggy shit; my b-boy chest rises up
You ain't a convict, you got caught jaywalking
And you don't know the alphabet, but you still talking
Well I got a blade too
And I know it's sharp enough to cut you
They call me starvin' Harlem, scissor tongue, I lick tissue
And pardon me, my lava just spit almost hit you
You know I got liver, spinning got a lot of it
We can call it in the air, this is for rain drop missiles
Heads or tails
The last cat who tried to see me, he now gotta touch braille
Everybody inherit the earth, why not?
We can sell it to the frail, and feed 'em fairy tales

(Vordul)
Cannibal O-plus the-X
love to sex, microphones, the type of poems
We spit rips through scripts and strips ya bones
Yo we sick wit poems off the dome
I'm off the known, inhaling Newports and eights
Cause New York is sick, still we walk and spit
Straight off the dick
Wit these niggas please you freeze in the NYC where everyone..

Live from the 1-3-5 representing niggas that strive
Straight through hard times trying to survive
Inside of New York, the island of crime
Where the most violent of minds, walkin these blocks
Stay eyeing on mine, yo my brain sparks like sporting a glock
I might start firing live, straight off of the top
Cannibal Ox, inspiring minds, flipping on tracks
Spitting these live, animal raps
I'm strangling cats, sliding on my side of the map
Thinking he all, you aint got it like a mighty matter of fact
You small, claiming you large?
I'm pulling ya car, leavin ya scarred
Reppin tragedy, warfare, but nod yo, this god writes like
Travelled bars and dabbled stars and shine to
Rap Allah, yo we crack cigars that gettin' me stressed
Pulling on sets, stabbing these birds, loving the sex 
Now I'm chillin in front of my rest
Smoking the rent, watching these cops, popping on blocks 
Screaming y'all niggas aint nothing awake 
We trying to gain freedom like a tribe in Tibet
Starving niggas had to still spit it live on the set
Live on the set
You know what I'm sayin? I dunno

So nigga
How you do it, we stay moving
Through the jungle, ghetto surviving, spittin lines off the
How you do it, we stay moving
Through the jungle, ghetto surviving, spittin lines off the
So how you do it, Cannibal O-plus the-X
Love to sex, microphones, the type of poems
We spit rips through scripts and strips ya bones
Off the dome, I'm off the known, inhaling Newports and eights
Cause New York is sick, but still we walk and spit
Straight off the dick
Wit deez, straight off the dick with these
Y'all gon' freeze in the NYC
Cannibal O, hail from the B
y'all better realize
Unh ah, unh unh unh

Cipher unknown, Cannibal O
unh
Straight off, straight off, straight off the dick with these
Y'all niggas freeze so please
unh, unh, straight off the dick with these
straight off the dick with these y'all niggas freeze
In the NYC so c'mon, please
