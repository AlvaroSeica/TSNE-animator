this goes out
to everybody everywhere
that I cross paths with
one day it'll all make sense
until we meet again

(chorus)
the sound from the streets like music to my ears
when I flow to the beat it's like music to my ears
through the call of it
I heard it all
I've been around for years
with the thought of even when I'm gone my music's gonna live

repeat chorus

I'm still spiritual
still living off of miracles
my heart shines bright indigo
I'm invisible
to the naked eye
I'mma take you by surprise
the world's not big enough
I over-maximize
I'm never satisfied
when it comes to this I want more
keep my name on your mind
that's what I'm on the road for
looking out my window
holding memoirs in my notebook
I document everything
fifty bars
no hook
this is all I know
that's my reality
and I appreciate everyone that's looking out for me
I gotta carry on
people here believe in me
but there's a lot of faces that smile and read envy
I see through it
stay focused and weave through it
jealousy can bring harm if it's deep rooted
stank eyes can wait for me to slip up
this is my world
i'll never give it up

chorus
repeat chorus

I die by what I live for
hear the sirens
bass, kicks, guitar riffs and violins
footsteps to a better place
there'll be better days
spending too much time planning it
your life sketched away
I been here before
I can understand
believe me
everything happens for a reason
take it easy
it is what it is
some things you just can't control
when it play with your mind
all you want is your soul
I never let Â‘em get too close
I need space
???? where you're going
??? each case
never take it personal
but always take it serious
in every aspect of this I'm highly experienced
cold-blooded is the game
the pain build immunity
never let emotions come between your opportunities
when handling your business
know who your friends is
I open up and break down
defenseless

chorus
repeat chorus

I play the game with two mindsets
one's correct
one's for the love of respect
the other's to collect
it's all expressed
I got a lot to get off my chest
I really don't complain too much
I been blessed
I never compromise my art to make the ends meet
so I think about
how I'm gon' eat
and where I'm gon' sleep
if it doesn't pay at the end of the week
and the end of the month I'm right back out on the street
but you know me
I bounce back up on my feet
so on my downfall
and place the plug up in the leak
all this shit I been through made me ten times stonger
and a piece of the pie couldn't fill my hunger
I want to be remembered by this world as a poet
you found a rose on this ground
and picked it up to grow it
I'm always in the midst
I'm too important to the recipe
as long as I'm alive and well you'll never get the best of me

chorus
repeat chorus

on and on and on and on
on and on

the sound from the streets like
when I flow to the beat it's like
the sound from the streets like
WHEN I FLOW TO THE BEAT IT'S LIKE</pre>
