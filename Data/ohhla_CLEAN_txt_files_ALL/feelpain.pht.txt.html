Look...

2009 I learned to count my money backwards
I'm hated my big chance niggas and fake rappers
Now I ain't gotta hustle, gettin it in with my daddy
You, turk, and neek we all we got
Fck no I ain't forgettin s...

Watxh who ya fck with, reall ass shit

I swea to God, croos my heart and hope to die

[Chorus]
Fuck what they tell you my nigga kuz I'll neva change
I know who to kall on if nobodi feel my pain
And I ain't trippin ova money my nigga
I'm a put money up on top of yours
Nobodi tell me different but you, you who I trust
I put my trust in my glock but sometimes it don't bust
And I ain't trippin on money my nigga
I'm a out money up on top of yours

[Verse]
2009 I learned to count my money backwards
I'm hated my big chance niggas and fake rappers
Now I ain't gotta hustle, gettin it in with my daddy
You, turk, and neek we all we got
Fck no I ain't forgettin savage
But this one for my daddy remember when I ain't have
That dope charge stealin cars tryna make his baby mama happy
Stupid shit, juvenile but now I'm welcomed to the parish
Fucked up but still loved, free the badass ratchet
Fucked up I lost friends but you daddy I still got
Remember I lost faith but you daddy I still got
Daddy them niggas missed us, me, ken, and trap
But now I know who really got it out the same trap
You shudda neva put me in that bently
I ges that's why ny friends became into my enemies
Fuck em, youngin it's fuck em
Fuck they mam fuck they people daaddy fuck em

[Chorus]
Fuck what they tell you my nigga kuz I'll neva change
I know who to kall on if nobodi feel my pain
And I ain't trippin ova money my nigga
I'm a pput money up on top of yours
Nobodi tell me different but you, you who I trust
I put my trust in my glock but sometimes it don't bust
And I ain't trippin on money my nigga
I'm a out money up on top of yours</pre>
