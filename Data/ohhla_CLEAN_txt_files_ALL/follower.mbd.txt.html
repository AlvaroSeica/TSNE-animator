[Prodigy]
It go hip-hop on our block
always lead to some fights and gun shots
niggas need to stop that bullshit hop
unless its really necessary to get hopped
you got asshole pulling out busting on pounds
just to hear the sound or to see the crowd bounce
niggas need to save that shit for outside
or take all that noise up the block dunn aiight un
staying at the times you got to drug a man
but godamn, you fucking up my pussy plan
fuck it
ya'll niggas never learn, so why should I concern
after the show I'll grab my click and the tires burn
off to the next pavilion
the infamous men, women, and children
stick together like dry ce-ment pieces
our story go too long for rap lines
too many of my niggas died on the front lines
the Mobb history go too deep for rhyme
could you feel a pain in the trilogy of my regiment
please do
we write these for you
with the hope that my words sink through
like on the page how the ink do
hey yo dunn check it
my every hour that passes
is guaranteed packed
cause the hour that's gone ain't never coming back
Im tired of wasted days
my eyes E&amp;J glaze
romp you tools flooded with smoke fumes
make faster moves
my raps can't lose
especially against you
how soon we forget niggas minds be getting absent
not gone for a minute 
ya'll niggas trying to shit
it's time for Pee to turn back on the light switch
and pull your faggot ass click out the darkness
yo its QB, queer bastard we queens best 
a quiet bullet will do yo ass justice
why you stupid fuck look at you now
I can't believe how these niggas now-a-days gets down
he just a clown from a foul part of town
who barely blent in 
he took my words on some personal shit
he just self-conscience
trying to flip on some desperate shit
don't be stupid 
the mobb been through it
don't be a follower and get yo ass led to the fire</pre>
