I'm lying on the ground, vultures in the sky
people falling off cliffs, but they don't die
I hop to my feet and brush off the dust
gotta stay positive, this is a must
I see a girl in the distance, she is my wife
I see a boy in the mirror, he is my life
I swear I'll take care of you til you're a man
it doesnt make since now, but you'll understand
the clouds are whipped cream, the sky is water
I'm holding hands with the future, I'm looking at my daughter
she looks like a goddess, I don't wanna leave
life is fantastic, so's reality
all my friends are alive, and my family is healthy
I got enough money, even awareness is wealthy
I'm shaking hands with sunflowers, and sipping on grapes
this world is my savior it's where I escape
music is my savior it's where I escape
fantastic is my savior, it's where I escaped

(Time and Input)
it's been fantastic, but now I must leave
the most beautifulest reality
it was fantastic, but now I must leave
the most beautifulest reality

my lungs are inflated, like pink balloons
I'm back with my lover, we sleep till noon
I wake up in the pm cook some french toast
I start the french roast wearing nothing but a trench coat
I see bjork on a swing set, tupac in a hoopty
I see mila kunis, she is my groupie
god is in the sky, he looks like a farmer
he's got a pail of water, my ego is my armor
he melts it off me along with my guilt
he teaches me forgiveness and everything it builds
I turn into a crow and off I go
with Carlos Castaneda in Mexico
I'm with james joyce in a rolls royce
next to bukowski, with a whisky voice
I'm hitchhiking with kerouac, he's bumping my tape
this world is my savior it's where I escape
music is my savior it's where I escape
fantastic is my savior, it's where I escaped

(Time and Input)
it's been fantastic, but now I must leave
the most beautifulest reality
it was fantastic, but now I must leave
the most beautifulest reality

goodbye to the angels with brunette hair
goodbye to the B cups and brown eyed stares
goodbye to the bubblegum, cotton candy sunsets
goodbye to my goddess, and all her just for fun sex
goodbye to fellini and salvador dali
goodbye Joe, I'll give a kiss to molly
goodbye to the good food, music and love
goodbye to the bright colors just because
they changed my perception on how everything was
now I'm flying through the Himalayas on a magic rug
goodbye to the mountains with sprinkles on top
goodbye to magenta, and virtuous cops
goodbye to the everything's gonna be all right
goodbye to enlightenment and 3rd eye sight
it used to be vampires but now I gotta cape 
this world is my savior it's where I escape
music is my savior it's where I escape
fantastic is my savior, it's where I escaped

(Time and Input)
it's been fantastic, but now I must leave
the most beautifulest reality
it was fantastic, but now I must leave
the most beautifulest reality

in between a vanished me, I can be my best friend</pre>
