[Verse One: Ice-T]
Six in the morning, police at my door
Fresh AdidasÂ® squeak across the bathroom floor
Out my back window, I made my escape
Didn't even get a chance to grab my old school tape
Mad with no music, but happy cause free
And the streets to a player is the place to be
Got a knot in my pocket, weighing at least a grand
Gold on my neck, my pistol is closed in hand
I'm a self-made monster of the city streets
Remotely controlled by hard Hip-Hop beats
But just living here in Montreux is a serious task
Didn't know what the pigs wanted, didn't have time to ask

[Break: Trigger Tha gambler]
EVERYBODY, PUMP YOUR FIST!!
EVERYBODY, PUMP YOUR FIST!!
PUMP YOUR FIST!!

[Ice-T]
Say WORD!!
Now after that one, we even got funkier, remember this one?
I remember this one

[Break: Trigger Tha gambler]
COME ON!! WAVE YOUR HANDS IN THE AIR!!
AND WAVE THEM LIKE YOU'RE JUST DON'T CARE!!
JUST WAVE YOUR HANDS IN THE AIR!!
AND WAVE THEM LIKE YOU'RE JUST DON'T CARE!!

[Verse Two: Ice-T]
I-C-E B-E-R-G - what's that spell?
Iceberg nigga, can't you read?
Time to bleed, slaughter, slice
Try to say I wasn't nice as we waxed them punks like lab mice
Dice them up, slice them up, dissect
Put you in a boiling pot and let your ass sweat
Cause I rap on game you say I'm weak in a freestyle?
Well 911 you should dial
Before my posse makes a move on your mom's crib
Think we got knives and guns? - (We got bombs, kid)
Blow up your whole block, you hear the gunshots
Throw you in the Syndicate cellar and watch your body rot
Cause I'm the coldest motherfucker that you ever heard
Call me The Ice, or just The Iceberg

[Break: Ice-T]
Yeah, Yeah, yeah!! - Come On!!
Just The Iceberg, can I do one about Evil E? - say YEAH!!

[Verse Three: Ice-T]
Evil E was at Cesspool with a freak one night
Fucked the bitch with a flashlight (DAMN!!)
Pulled it out and left the batteries in
So he could get a charge when he begins (UHH!!)
Used his dick, the shit was tight
Bitch's titties start blinking like tail lights
Rolled her over to change the connection
The bitch's ugly face, cold spoiled his erection
I'm the Ice rhymer, big timer
And yes I'm a pimp, player, hustler, kind of Mack
Poet, impressive, I know it
Don't only rhyme for niggaz cause I live my life co-ed
On the mic, it's living, breathing hype, a 1995 type Dolomite
Cool motherfucker (WORD!!) call me The Ice, or just The Iceberg

[Break: Evil E]
Yeah, put your fist in the air, let's go
COME ON!! COME ON!! COME ON!!
COME ON!! COME ON!! COME ON!!
Power, say POWER!! say POWER!! say POWER!! say POWER!!
Evil E, say POWER!! Evil E, say POWER!!
Say POWER!! say POWER!! say POWER!!

[Verse Four: Ice-T]
I'm living large as possible, posse unstoppable
Style topical, vividly optical
Listen, you'll see them, sometimes I'll be them
Cops, critics and punks, never ever wanted to see us in (POWER)
Well, that's too bad, Apocalypse Now I'm back and I'm mad
We're coming, you're running, cold and cunning
Ice-T on the mic (Said What?) Top Gunning
After your neck, checking respect
Making you sweat, Rhyme Syndicate boy in effect
The rap motivator, teacher, talker, the rhyme stalker
Words thrilling, so real, they're chilling
The hit author, getting louder than a shot gun
You don't want none
RHYME PAYS was the name of the album
But that was number one, this was number two
My posse grew, we're gonna break through with POWER!

[Outro: Trigger Tha gambler]
POWER!! YO, PUMP IT UP!! PUMP IT UP!!
POWER!! JUST PUMP IT UP!! PUMP IT UP!!
POWER!!</pre>
