[Chorus 2X: Dungeon Masta]
Your people don't have a clue, what we go through
Your people don't have an idea, what we been through

[Dungeon Masta]
As I dwell in my social trip for heaven and hell
A dark force inside me will cause me to yell
Cuz I gotta pull a hole, if I didn't, I make bail
If I had my way, I'd burn down all the jails
Watching all these cats and deaths that look frail
Overbase security guard, ready to tell
If you spaz out, as out, straight to the 'why me' pen
Hit 'em in the chin, before they pull they 'why me' pin
Ding ding ding, ultra the races, riot gears off of trouble
If you at not, we can take over the bubble
You think we won't get to the lady C.O.?
That be the ones to get it first
Don't trust a shorty, congratulate she stripping
I've been locked down so long, even the ugly ones look good
Don't get gassed, I saw your forest and you're robbing her
For your chin plates, sit down on the chair that did techs
Metal pull ya drawers down, sins looking up
For loonies, random searches, disrespecting people
Living quarters, treating grown men like babies
Then they wonder why they wilding

[Chorus 2X]

[Dungeon Masta]
All inside my mental and dig deep
How many MC's must I put to sleep
You talk mad shit, when you roll with your peeps
Creep up on ya, uh uh, blow up ya jeep
In the P's, enemies get stuck for keys
Tragedies, co-signments, penalties for the indies
The only thing that's left from ya, is memories
Tragedies, caught up in a rage, next page
Cost a mad ransom, fam, get ya dough up
Black &amp; Spanish cats, found the four, when they blow up
How many rap cats you know that got open cases
So much drama, now it's all going to waste
How dare you hold ya head high, when you're a disgrace
When the dough runs out, like sour gas face
You won't be able to afford to live in your place
Lifestyle erase, go home and find a trace

[Chorus 3X]

[Dungeon Masta]
As I think of an easier way to escape
My mindstate, is ready to claim your fate
The only thing I feel in my heart now is hate
I'm not doing too great, for dough, I can't wait
If you want to make a move, don't hesitate
My ratchet don't discriminate, only penetrate
Elevate your soul, while your corpse disintegrate
Feeling mad lifted, as I'm twisted off the grape
If you want it bad enough, then come and get it
Death upon 'em, in the undustry who shhhh
I'm saying no names, but you know who you are
What's race you liable to catch a hot one, hot one

[Chorus 4X]</pre>
