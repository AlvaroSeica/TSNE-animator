She has a beautiful face
And no tattoos
Long hair that doesn't smell like cigarettes or booze
She's a virgin in forty-nine states
And she's not from Jersey, so she's feeling kinda out of place
Nine-digit combination to her embrace
Off Topic Â– eight letters and one space
I've been this life, been this twice
Every time I do right it's not because of, it's in spite
So much nothing happens for so long
Then inspiration strikes from nowhere and there's a new song
The worst joke life plays on us kids is
You have no choice who you fall in love with
And girl if you wanna ride, we can ride
Put that shit in drive
And cruise til the sunrise
And if you wanna just chill in these cold months
I'd be happy just to relax for once

She's into hip-hop music
Some of it I'm not feeling
But we can argue about it
That makes her more appealing
She don't play herself, least not that I've seen
And she don't give a fuck about what's cool in a magazine
She stays real positive, and I admire that
She comes running for a hug when the world makes her sad
Sometimes I think everything we learned growing up as kids
Must be ninety-nine percent bullshit and one ad-lib
I can't believe the circumstances surrounding me
Nothing ever seems to happen how it's supposed to be
How could something that seems to be so damn perfect
In actuality be all fucked and not worth it?
But girl if you wanna ride, we can ride
Put that shit in drive
And cruise til the sunrise
And if you wanna just chill in these cold months
I'd be happy just to relax for once

She's got her ears pierced, but that's it
No nipples, belly button, no clit
A little bit of make-up, but she could do without
None of the fakeness that Phife talked about
The girl's just chill and I can't understand it
She's got two really fucked up parents
Her dad thinks he's a pimp, her mom is transparent
They're both focused on grandma's inheritance
I remember nearly every detail of the transaction
But I'm still not really sure how it happened
All I know is that I gave a little part of me
Now I'm just a little less of what I used to be
So girl if you wanna ride, we can ride
Put that shit in drive
And cruise til the sunrise
And if you wanna just chill in these cold months
I'd be happy just to relax for once
And girl if you wanna ride, we can ride
Put that shit in drive
And cruise til the sunrise
And if you wanna just chill in these cold months
I'd be happy just to stay home and fuck</pre>
