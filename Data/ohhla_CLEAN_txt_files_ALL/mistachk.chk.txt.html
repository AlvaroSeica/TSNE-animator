Yeah...uhum.
Let's set it off
Mista (Yo P..yo Slick)
Line 'em to you
Yo Bob
They call me mista..
Aaight
To you
This about report to the comissioner
To you
This about that time
Set it off..

[VERSE I]
To all the critics that had me counted out
To all the cynics I fought &amp; Thought they had me figured out
Who opened doors on 32 tours
From last year's GIVE IT UP goin' back to YOU
'RE GONNA GET YOURS
38 countries in the name of hip hop
Never stopped, 7 Continents
Attackin governments
Political rhyme practice
I gave cause you lack this
Serious sense of time and world geographics
Bring ya brain outside philly
East to the West, North to the South
If you're black we can't all be Big Willie (never)
And to be judged by a hit
By some counterfeit click
That's some bell curve shit
Cause I'm cool like this
Now how I get my swerve on I keep hittin nerve bombs
Relax the saluting arms carry on and carry on
My record speaks for itself I never stopped the hip hop
And I never jumped backwards or kissed myself

[Chorus]
If you don't know me you can call me Mistachuck (D)
Public Enemy number one (yeah..I'm tellin you)
If you don't know me you can call me Mistachuck (D)
Public Enemy number one
If you don't know me you can call me Mistachuck (D)
Public Enemy number one (I'm tellin you)
If you don't know me you can call me
(c'mon)

[Verse II]
Can't win without beginning it
Heed the word of the brother and the voice that got muscles in it
Now Im'ma show you a waste is a terrible thing to mind
Rhymes without education equals butter from the gutter
And all this talk about the street we stay in &amp; playin
Is a fishtank by the hated you thank
And you say ho hum another story to bore me
Maria take a letter tell Mayor have a freeknik in Marietta
Here comes the halfstepper hypocrites and advocates
Who care
But be crashin like US Air
The last Bohemian but you'll never see me intoxicated
By bones in drug zones I hate it
One on one black CNN
Keep it from bein in the cartoon network
The rhymes can hurt and do work
Got you lookin for the loot
Is down down to the one &amp; shoot
50 fought to the cracker so for all y'all I getz blacker

[Chorus]
If you don't know me you can call me Mistachuck
Public Enemy number one
If you don't know me you can call me Mistachuck
Public Enemy number one
You don't know me you can call me Mistachuck
If you don't know me you can call me mister

[Verse III]
I don't care for Range Rovers
Cause the price is too high
And I feel em gettin over
Land Cruisers, Issuzus or new shoes
Man dem notes is heavy
That's why I got a couple Chevies
Low budget I am believe me when I speak it
Limousine ain't a damn thing unless they let me keep it
I duck the cakewalk and all dat BS talk
About what's fatter West coast, North, South or New York
It don't matter
It don't matter

[Chorus]
If you don't know me you can call me Mistachuck (D)
Public Enemy number one (yeah..)
If you don't know me you can call me Mistachuck (D)
Public Enemy number one
You don't know me you can call me Mistachuck (D)
Public Enemy number one
If you don't know me you can call me mister chuck
(The hard rhymer)
(Yeah check it out
Mister
For you
Yes...and you...and you....for all y'all)</c></pre>
