(Talking: E-ball, DJ Dial Tone, Jady Experience)
What's up E-ball (yeah)
Demolition bout to rule the world...(no doubt no doubt)
I know yall got the Kreative Natives and all that but it's
time for LAZ to
get his shine on
(yeah word....L - A - Z - O do your thing my
brother.....make these
motherfuckers go blind!)

[Chorus]
It's on me it's my time to shine
My time to rhyme and intertwine
Through these f-ing baselines
It's on me it's my time to shine
My time to shine my time to shine

(Verse 1: Lazo the GWShark)
Now it's that black verbal demon captured in flesh
Still scheming to splatter these tracks man Lazarus!
I'm hazardous for your health don't write these rhymes for the wealth
I'm trying to see like how many times I can impress myself
And I'm impressed when I manifest my feelings
With lyrics so hot they  <crack ceiling="" fucking="" out="" plaster="" the="">
And I'm reveling that I been sparring with my spiral
Magnificent, most significant words written since the Bible
Wrote these flaming hymnals to scorch your mentals
Then make your body tremble in consecutive intervals
Yo! mics I swarm like Jamaicans wear orange
And back in '92 into the Natives I was sworn
That's when I took that oath that decided my fate
We had to orchestrate it's time to Kreate and Dictate!
And if I live by that it will all be right! right!
I'll get my time to shine up in the f-ing lime light

[Chorus]

(Verse 2: Lazo the GWShark)
Laz fell up in the campsite to excite
That venomous strike reminisce caboom vipe'
Cause when I speak I reach just like Dante's peak
Laz reciting rhymes written in volcanic ink
And as Long as I'm a Native rhymes be razor sharp
Cause I stroke my pen just like a goddess strokes her harp
E said spark a verse for me and I concurred
But cats say we herbs cause we from the suburbs
But that don't make no sense and you'll see
Instead of dissing me you ought to switch your style to karaoke
Cause that's more fitting this this rhyme was written just to show
Who's the GREAT still slitting throats up on the mix tapes
Now that's the vibe niggas is left like scared alive
You better come creative or you will not survive
Now that's the essence my presences alone
Hits the tracks full throttle throw the spices in the air
Or I stick to the bottle yeah and we can all get nice and
Lazarus entice through this damned mic device
And I bet you'll bump my little single in your vessel
Bobbing real hard then through your arms around the broad
In the passenger seat massaging shoulders to the beat
Yeah you owe me one I helped you get her in the sheets
Cause she love the way I'm rhyming, to the top I'm climbing
Breath control and timing shining like a fuckin diamond

[Chorus]

(Verse 3: Lazo the GWShark)
Laz Loves Lacing Lack Luster Linguists
Suburbian Scorpion So Secretly I Sting this
Eastern Entity be Expressing through that English
Ferocious Free-verses be having Fuckers Feeling Fiendish
Sometimes I get Sort of Squeamish when I See these Sorry Singers
Ridiculous Rappers Writing Radio Ringers
But on Stage I'm Seldom Separate from Cire'
So them Back-talking Bastards leave Bruised and Bloody
By that Kreative Carnivore Created to Consume
With Devious Dialogue that Dictates your Doom
See My Mind's Masterpiece was Meshed with Mal-intent
So you Better Bust your Blinker Before that ass get Bent
See These Tedious Tactics got Tackled by The Thinker
Landed in Lovely Language that Lasts Long and Lingers
See my Verbal Venom is like a Visual Virus
It's Intent to Ignite all Inside your Iris
So Bitch Beware Before you and your Boys go Blind
Swiftly Shut your Shit So I can Spit this Sunshine!

[Chorus]
