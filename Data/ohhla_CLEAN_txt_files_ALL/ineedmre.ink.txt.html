Song:   I Need More
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I said
Girl I think I need more..

[Verse 1]
Ya
Usually I'm not worried
But der is something that is about you like marryn
I need a lil time
Maybe piece of mind
Know I got that cake n she can get a piece of mine
But that ain't wut you want
Yous a good girl
So is it bad I wanna treat yo body good girl
All of yo friends say tghat you should girl
Just give me a chance boo you gotta understand..

[Chorus]
No we ain't been togetha that lng
You wanna take it slow but
Girl I think I need more
Tryna play it cool just can't ignore
Girl I think I need more
So give it all you gotten
Ima give it to yo body
Say you neva been like this before
But.. girl I think I need more

[Verse 2]
Usually I don't do this
Girl as bad as you is
Sayin know yo swag is stupid
Worth a milli ion milli ion
Body look scilli ion
Know I got that pencil baby
U shud let me fill it in
I say it loud.. audio voice
My paper out.. multiple choice
But I ain't got no question for ya
O, Expect shawty can I get to know ya
Can I get closer
Closer than close up
We belong like a toaster to my holster come on
Girl you shinin wit the light out
N you know ill beat it right out
Til the sheets look like some white out

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Lets do something you ain't use too
Spend the nite so it don't feel like I used u
Its no reason to be hesitant
I said I'm ready girl
Go get a oven mitt
I know I be on some otha shit
Might take charge
but I can cover it
you haunted by the niggas n yo past
but all I can invision is me grippin on yo ass
so come right ova here
n give me wut I want
do some of do things you tell dem otha nigga that you want
I swear you got a coke body shake it up you cud explode
Body sayin yes but yo mind sayn no

[Chorus]</pre>
