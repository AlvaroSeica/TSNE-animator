Artist: Saigon
Album:  The Greatest Story Never Told
Song:   I Want it All
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Chorus]
I want it all
I want the cars and the fancy things
I want the life this success shit bring
I want the love and the power and respect
That's the way it seems
Said I said I want it all-ah-ah-all-ah-oh-all, ah-ah-oh
I said I want it all-ah-ah-all-ah-ah-all, oh-oh oh-oh-oh

[Saigon]
Okay; I wanna ball like LeBron or Chris Paul
But what I want even more is to finally get in the door
I want the critics to give me the credit that I deserve
Wanna show 'em how vicious a nigga is with the verve
Want the Burger King burger with the McDonald's fries
Want the Marriott but wanna save money so it's the Econo Lodge
I want people to see that I was poppin way before Entourage
Flow you can not describe
I wanna know if my sister fuckin if she protected
I want that President Obama to get re-elected
I want the kind of rhymin I'm doing to be accepted
Since my rhyme was silent at times I'd probably be rejected
I want... longevity
I want Saigon to be strong as I'll ever be, when I'm going on 70
I want mom's recipe for sweet potato pie
It was to die for, I want a reply y'all

[Chorus] w/ minor variations

[Saigon]
(I want it all) I want the Beamer, Benz and Bentley
Even though that I know they come with jealousy and envy
I want people to be honest even when it offends me
Unless they wanna wake up the violence that's deep within me
I wanna thank everybody that want the dark to shine
I wanna earn the true dollar sign without doin blue-collar crime
I want you and you to learn how to rhyme
You can't call yourself an emcee if you're just spewin the five'n'dime
I want the kids in the ghetto to go to school
by the multitude; want them to know that flunkin is so uncool
I wanna know who's relatin gangbangin with entertainment
Probably the same dude that'll be the complaintant
I want the paintings, y'all could buy up the jewelery
I want hip hop to stop providing this buffoonery
I want the opportunity, I promise on mommas I won't stall
I'm telling you pah~!

[Chorus] w/ minor variations

[Saigon]
(I want it all) I want to send a rest in peace to Mr. Mass Appeal
I wanna feel if Nicki Minaj ass is real
I wanna know if you dangerous or a daffodil
Like do you want this machete or want this Massengil?
I wanna welcome myself back into rap
Y'all can clap or have an asthma attack
As a matter of fact, I want everybody imaginin that
I was the one out of the pack that ain't go staggerin back
(Say it again) I wanna welcome myself back into rap
Y'all can clap or have an asthma attack
As a matter of fact, you think I came this far
for me to motherfuckin fall? Hell naw!

[Chorus] - last half w/ variations</pre>
