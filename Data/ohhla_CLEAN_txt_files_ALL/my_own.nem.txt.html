Now Everything Makes Sense
Geah, uhh

I was born alone and I'm damn for sure gon' die alone
In this world it's just me and my microphone
I feel cursed like the Kennedys
And sometimes I feel like I'm my own worst enemy
Let me explain, cause when I'm deep in the zone
There's nobody that can touch me, just leave me alone
It's like I got the key to throne but I lost it
Niggaz think it's fun and games tryin to get on, but I'm exhausted
And I ain't signed yet, guess it ain't my time yet
Start to get high and mess up my whole mindset
I'm on the grind yes, doin it big watch me
And truthfully, I'm the only person that can stop me
I'd be Wayne Gretzky if rap was hockey
but I'm more like Barry Bonds, arrogant and cocky
Radio don't wanna hear it, labels don't wanna see it
I guess they want a follower and I was born a leader (yes)

[Chorus]
I'm my own worst enemy
Sometimes I feel like I just can't do it
I'm my own worst enemy
But somehow someway, I just gotta get through it

[Nems]
They say be careful what you wish for; damn I gotta get on
Like - why I gotta take all of this shit for?
And it ain't nobody's fault but my own
Already 24 years old, dawg I'm all grown
Jails, institutions, and then there's death
The only thing I haven't seen man that's all that's left
All that's ever gonna happen if I keep actin up
I talk a lot of shit but I'm a G, I back it up
I keep it real as FUCK and I do it with a passion
You judge a man not by his words but by his actions
You might see me laughin, you might see me cryin
You might see me livin, you might see me dyin
But you won't hear me lyin got the heart of a lion
I hear them haters talkin - small thing to a giant
They don't know the person that I am, they never will
If they don't sign me it's their loss, I'll get another deal

[Chorus]

[Nems]
Def Jam wanted to sign us, Shady wanted my story
But my reputation entered the room right before me
True story, them drugs had me empty
When I'm focused, don't no man could stand against me
But the devil had me fooled, thinkin that I need somethin to perform
When the truth is, I don't need nothin to get on
Ecstasy diet was the quiet before the storm
Pocket full of drugs required to do a song
I did it all night long and slept the day away
Woke up when it was dark out and couldn't stay awake
I had to change, couldn't take it any longer
It didn't kill me so I guess it made me stronger

[Chorus]</pre>
