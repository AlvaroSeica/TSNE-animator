[T-Pain]  The mighty cyclone

Chorus: Mickael
She moves her body like a
Cyclone
And she makes me wanna do it all
Night long
Going hard, when they turn the spot
Lights on
Because she moves her body like a
Cyclone
Just like a cyclone (She moves her body like a)
Cyclone
And she makes me wanna do it all
Night long
Going hard, when they turn the spot
Lights on
Because she moves her body like a
Cyclone
The mighty cyclone

[Baby Bash]
(Verse 1)
Now look at that
Dumper on the back of that bumper
She ain't even
Playing when she shaking that rumpa
And, oh, you ain't
Know, she get lower than a muffler
Either with her girlfriends
Or showstoppin' with her hustler
The way she move her body, she might see the Maserati
She wanna put it on me, tryin' to show me her tsunami
She make it hard to copy, always tighten, never sloppy
And got an entourage and her own paparazzi
Now, there she go
Again, ridin' through the stormy weather
You better button
Up, if you wanna go get her
Cause it is
What it is, everybody wanna love her
But when she
Pop it, boy, you better run for cover {*thunder*}

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 2)
It's a rap
When she breakin' boys off the typhoon (It's a rap)
Gotta get that feri like a boss Tycoon (It's a rap)
Now hold it steady, cause she make a monsoon (It's a rap)
Now you can Google, download to iTunes
See, what I'm sayin', she ain't playin', bet she got the mans turnin'
You gon' hear 'em clack-clack, when them heels get to burnin'
Stiletto so fuego
She got her own label
And got us all doin' her tomato
Ugh!

Hook: T-Pain
Shawty got looks (And)
Shawty got class
Shawty got hips (And)
Shawty got ass
Once she hits the stage, she
Drop it down low like
{*T-Pain revving*}
Hey!
This is crazy
It's amazing
She must be the one, the lady
{*T-Pain revving*}
Oh!

Repeat Chorus

{*T-Pain revving*}

[T-Pain]
Oh!</pre>
