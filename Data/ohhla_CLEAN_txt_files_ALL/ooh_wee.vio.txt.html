Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

Ahh, AHHHH
Woo woo woo woo - the hit is out when we spit it out
Let it out, and there ain't no doubt, when we hear you shout
   Woo woo woo woo!  Get it on, witcha ghetto mom
   Precious metal on, when I get you home, shit it's on
Woo woo woo woo - we ain't goin far, backseat of the car
Baby doll, ghetto superstar, meet me at the bar
   Woo woo woo woo!  And I got a big crew
   Hope you know the drinks is on you, so whatchu wanna do?

[CRU]
This is it now, I spit now
Extra clips now, to make you shift now
C-R-U, you doin it?  We-are-too
C and me, be-a-few
Uz' weigh a ton, don't let your tongue slip
You will not have a fade when I give you the clips
but you will get faded, but why bother
At this rap thing I'm like your grandfather's father, great

Wait, every line counts!
Money in our pockets, so let me find out
Somebody wanna stop it?  Deduct our profit?
Dubbin the album instead of goin to cop it?
Nines I cock it, one squeeze will pop it
Get on my nerves and watch how how yo' block it
Cheeks I lock it, thrustin like a rocket
8-1-0, 7-3, criminal docket
Local corners and projects, they knock it
Me and yo' Bee is like Tubbs and Crockett
Money in our pocket, y'all need to stop it
You still in New York with a demo tryin to shop it

   I never had a flow like this before (that's right)
   Give it to me daddy til I beg for more (uhh)
   Ooh wee!
Hit em in da head, give em what they lookin fo'
Y-O-G, Chadio, we'll hook somebody up
   People in the club goin side to side (side to side)
   Dancin with their hands up high (uhh)
   Ooh wee!
Hit em in da head, give em what they lookin fo'
Y-O-G, Chadio, we'll hook somebody up
   Woo woo woo woo!
The hit is out when we spit it out
Let it out, and there ain't no doubt, when we hear you shout
   Woo woo woo woo!  Get it on, witcha ghetto mom
   Precious metal on, when I get you home, shit it's on
Woo woo woo woo - we ain't goin far, backseat of the car
Baby doll, ghetto superstar, meet me at the bar
   Woo woo woo woo!  And I got a big crew
   Hope you know the drinks is on you, so whatchu gon' do?

[CRU]
When I spits, I spits for them thugs cats
Money under the rug cats, bust a slug cats
Robbin the greedy and givin to the needy
Frequent the spots to slow down the CD
Walk in the streets where they gots no name
And it's hot as the core of the devil's flame
So go cop clothes, I'd rather cop nines (for real)
for them thirsty ones that wanna stop mine

[Yogi]
I wake up in the mornin, got the yearnin for papes
Madagas', for that ass, CD's and tapes
Been through Grants like ?, you know, true indeed
Flow tight like Patrick Ewing knees, pah-lease
Turn haters to a life of a crime - take dat
With a recipe, you couldn't make dat
Where the dice?  Pick em up, just SHAKE DAT
Where that ass?  On the dancefloor, SHAKE DAT, til you break dat
Hands high like I'm hemp
In the room with more bastards than Shawn Kemp
Wrote some hits that's notable, you know a few
Yogi, I won't stop until I'm quotable, loca

   I never had a flow like this before
   Give it to me daddy til I beg for more
   Ooh wee!
Hit em in da head, give em what they lookin fo'
Y-O-G, Chadio, we'll hook somebody up
   People in the club goin side to side (goin side to side)
   Dancin with their hands up high (side to side)
   Ooh wee!
Hit em in da head, give em what they lookin fo'
Y-O-G, Chadio, we'll hook somebody up
   Woo woo woo woo!
The hit is out when we spit it out
Let it out, and there ain't no doubt, when we hear you shout
   Woo woo woo woo!  Get it on, witcha ghetto mom
   Precious metal on, when I get you home, shit it's on
Woo woo woo woo - we ain't goin far, backseat of the car
Baby doll, ghetto superstar, meet me at the bar
   Woo woo woo woo!  And I got a big crew
   Hope you know the drinks is on you, so whatchu gon' do nigga?

It's a new millenium
C-R-U, The Mighty Ha, Chadio, Yogi
Anybody wanna battle, we can take it there
The streets, we can take it there
Uh-huh, and it don't stop</pre>
