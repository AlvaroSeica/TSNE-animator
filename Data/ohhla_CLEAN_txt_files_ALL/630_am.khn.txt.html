Fresh
For 0 A.D
You SUCKERS!

[Soul Khan]
It took me 23 years just to write this verse
I felt the sum of all fears in a lightning burst
I was shaking at the window like Pookie with a Pipe
But there ain't no director when the movie is your life
Look for answers in The Book but it takes too long
And it ain't like Nina Simone can make new songs
They said if I speak my mind, I'll be despised
Stick to liquor punchlines, ass cheeks and thighs
But I'm just too potent
I get you open, like a flesh wound
Hopin that the fresh truths soak in
Oh, they got flow? Well I exhale oceans
How could they not know? They up the next male's colon
This is for the pipe dreamers with the nine-to-five fever
The hardest working fathers and the Friday night divas
I dedicate my resume to all my light sleepers
Who stay awake and wonder where the future might lead us</pre>
