Uh yea
I ain't fucking with like that there
No I can't be fucking with you like that there lil daddy
You too hot
What you trying to get me busted or something must be
Man tripping

(Soulja Slim) 
I just got to hear this one time
That you fucking around with one time
Got a nigga busted one time
Dog you wasn't really made for this
Real niggas stay silent
Rats be on some get down first crazy shit
Don't even speak to me when you see me
Cause my four nickel be like please squeeze it nice and easy
I rather die up in the pen than be a dirty rat ya heard that
If my nigga don't take the charge fuck it give me thirty flat
Thats the code that I live by and won't break
Fuck the feds let them interrogate spit in they face
I don't nothing about a thing ya talk
You got me fucked up talking about if I rat I walk
Suck my dick I ain't nothing but a state baby
I make mines off this gangsta shit you been hearing lately
I read the transcript lil daddy ratting like its legal
I ain't fucking with him he fucking with them fed people
That's cold blooded

(Chorus x2)
I ain't fucking with you cheese eataz
You rat niggas that be fucking with them fed peoples
That niggas got loose vowels at the mouth
Silent niggas know the niggas that I'm talking about
Uh huh

You know that real nigga you thought was silent
Well he a motherfucking rat he told on everybody
I heard he took the stand and got a nigga a life sentence
It hurt me to my heart cause this nigga was bout his business
All the shit he done up in the game don't even count
They told him he won't see the street he start running his mouth
Ra ra ryan blazay blahing about this and that
Now them people trying to lethal inject my dog fat
I'm with you nigga camouflage with the hard hat
A silent nigga to the gristle what you call that
And if that rat ever hit the street anytime soon 
He gotta get hit with that rata tata boom
See I'ma start being a rat trap for all the rats
Just put some cheese on the trap you eat it thats a rap
And I'ma check the trap as soon as I smell something
Thats the end of that rat there he ain't gon tell nothing
Ya'll smell something

(Chorus x2)

(Soulja Slim)
They had a dope shop on willow street
Let sarge tell it the dope shop was ran by me
He said he had me under surveillance for about a week
He ain't nothing but a klans member without a sheet
That white bitch got half of the U.P.T.
Back in town josing the O.P.P
Look here round this one here for all of ya'll
Fuck sarge and his task force bitch boys
I'm living large and they hating cause they living small
So they put me behind bars try to stop my fall
Somebody snitching I think I know who the fuck it is
One of my cutthroaters cut throated me it brought tears
I been fucking around you for too many years
But you ratted on me dog out of fear
Thats fucked I wanna how the fuck that go

(Chorus x2)</pre>
