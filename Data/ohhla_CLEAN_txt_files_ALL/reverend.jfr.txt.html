[ INTRO: The Fresh Prince acting as 'The Reverend' ]
Now brothers and sisters
There comes a time in your life you've got to get up and get busy
Can I get a witness?
(Yes, brother, yes!)
Now I don't know if you're prepared to embark upon this journey
But the time is running out
Brother Jazzy, break it down

[ VERSE 1: The Fresh Prince ]
Liggedy-ladies and gentlemen, hello, and how are you doin all?
Now there's a problem that we really have got to solve
In our society there's a big mess
People are having entirely too much stress
And me and Jeff, yo, we've been workin on
A way to ease your everyday burdens of
Work and school, because we thought that we should
Make a record that makes people feel good
This is a remedy, simple and basic
You work too hard, come on, face it
You gotta treat yourself, you deserve it
Dance like a wild person, come on, you earned it
Young and old and old and young
Relax, come on, cool out, come and get some
You gotta let yourself go get loose, it's
Cool - dance to the music

[ VERSE 2: The Fresh Prince ]
Say ?J-e-f? this beat is def
Can I get a witness, Jeff? (Yes)
Are you ready to start things off yet?
(-) Aight bet
Clap your hands and dance, come on, let's do this
Here is a hip-hop track with a new twist
Designed to ignite a subliminal dance fuse
And even if you can't dance, you can't lose!
It's for everybody, you included
We hooked up a beat and a rhyme and e.q.-ed it
We put it on a tape and took it to [Name]
And then we - yo Jeff, where's my beat at?
Oh, there it is, back to the story line
The music and rhyme are designed to make you have a (good time)
At the party, or wherever you hear it pumpin
Get up and twist or breakdance or shake somethin
Yo man, this groove is all of that!
And it's different from anything we've done, in fact
I might even go as far as to say
This cut shines bright on the darkest day
And sometimes you really need some light
Like when your teacher or boss ain't actin right
This will quench your thirst to chill, it hits the spot
Give em a taste, yo Jeff, let the beat rock

( *only the beat is heard* )

[ BREAK: The Fresh Prince acting as 'The Reverend' ]
Now Brother Jazzy
Please enlighten us with a bassline
( *Jazzy Jeff lets the bassline play* )
And for all the people assembled before us
Brother Jazzy, scratch
( *Jazzy Jeff cuts* )

[ The Fresh Prince ]
We're at the top, not the bottom or the middle
We're the freshest, the deffest, the best, Jeff, cut it up a little

(Oh, I get it, you wanna dance!)

[ VERSE 3: The Fresh Prince ]
Ahhhh... the time is now to get up and dance and move
And clap and jump and jam and feel the groove
I want you wigglin and jigglin and stompin and shakin
And showin your approval for the records me and Jeff are makin
We got a brand new album out
And dancin and shakin and movin is what it's all about
We want everybody to get busy
You're not down with the Rev, then get with it
This is a new age, history turned a new page
They said that we would decay and I say who do they
Think they're dealing with, a couple of amateurs?
I'm willin to bet to where this jam hits
At your job and at your school dance and also on the radio
Winter inside the house, summer on the patio
Let me get out of here before I lose it
But remember the motto, y'all: dance to the music

[ OUTRO: The Fresh Prince acting as 'The Reverend' ]
Now now
Ladies and gentlemen of the congregation
We realize you are not in a position to get up and dance right now
So we'd like to ask of you, if you're in your car, honk your horn
Honk your horn to the rhythm
We'd like to ask, if you're behind the desk at your job
We'd like you to tap your pen and pencil to the rhythm
If you're walkin down the street
You can be a little discreet
And snap your fingers to the beat
But if you are in a position
To get up and dance
We'd like to ask you to wiggle and jiggle everything you got
And get involved with it
