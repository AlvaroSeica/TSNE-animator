[INTRO]
Yeah
All these hatas their just forced to hate no reason (fuck yall)
Don't really know who I am at all (fuck yall mutha fuckas)
So I guess I kinda gotta introduce my self again to
These mutha fuckas so I'm just like yeah

[Verse 1]
Please tah meet ya find me with ah heep of reefa
Speaking etha ill whoop ya ass and crease ya sneakers
Hatas keep the haten lil faggots figure skaten
While we figure eightin seekin your replace ment and I ain't gon
Touch the hate like some bacteria
Some nasty ass food from the cafateria
You'll have and hear me bruh if you pass me up ah luh
Ima beat ya ass tearin you in half and eat ya up
Like any given friday I roll up to ya drive way rock
U in the face have you lookin sideways
So step back cause you ain't want it with Mac the young
Cat with rap to leave you flat on your back
And as ah matter of fact I'm like crack on the track
With mah cap to the back I'm the cat in the hat
Yeah we rhymen like Dr. Seuss so be careful before you end up on the news
Everytime that we..

[Chorus]
CRUISE like we ain't got nothing to loose
Hit the speech throught the speakers hope its comen in smooth
When we CRUISE see I ain't got nothing to do
So ima roll around the city smoken blunts with mah crew
When we CRUISE [x2]

[Verse 2]
And there ain't nobody that do it like Pittsburg (NOPE)
Said there ain't nobody do it like Pittsburg (NOT AH)
I said it twice just incase that you misheard
Cause this verse is like........
So quit ya back talk I ain't haven it boy
I'm lookin fresh right now straight dazzlen boy
Light a swisher now I'm gone
When my minds on, 5's on, laced up, headed out the time bomb
Get your life right size truck whit a white light
Triple x tee and a fresh pair of white nikes
I wright like nobody you've seen
Cause my weed is purple and my money is green
See I'm hungry for cream with my fitted on lean
If you wanna talk shit, ima shit on your teaam
I rock my fitted to the side
Roll around the city blowing piff up in the sky
When we..

[Chorus]
CRUISE like we ain't got nothing to loose
Hit the speech throught the speakers hope its comen in smooth
When we CRUISE see I ain't got nothing to do
So ima roll around the city smoken blunts with mah crew
When we CRUISE [x2]

[Verse 3]
The kid raps like lasers, sharp like rasors
Rollin up my weed and some ?gos see a vegas? (yuup)
Fuck a cop tryna chase me with tasers,
I'm runnin out my crib and I'm dippin through the neighbors, garden
High homie marvin the marshin
I wipe my ass with you soft rappers like charmin
Yall hungry I'm starvin, you talkin shit, oh I beg your pardon
Specifics is never gimics,
I rip it just how I live it,
You wanna it ill go and get, I'm kickin it so escuisit
The wickedest mothafucka on the block I live at
Shit talk on hip hop I'm pealing your wig back, yuup
So where the crib at, where the party at,
Where them butt naked hoes and the bacardi at
Cause when I start to rap, its gameova
And I ain't spend a single one sober
When we..

[Chorus]
CRUISE like we ain't got nothing to loose
Hit the speech throught the speakers hope its comen in smooth
When we CRUISE see I ain't got nothing to loose
So ima roll around the city smoken blunts with mah crew
When we CRUISE [x2]</pre>
