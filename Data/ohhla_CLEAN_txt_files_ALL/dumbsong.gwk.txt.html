[Gawkman]
You're dumb
You're dumb
Same thing
Still dumb

Hey Murph, you're dumb!
  No, you're dumb
No, no you're dumb!!
  Well you're dumb, cause you got glasses on
Well you're... dumb
  Your nose is funny, and dumb
Oh yeah? Well your eyes are dumb
  I'm gonna sing why you're dumb

Your books are overdue, because you're dumb
  Oh yeah? Well your hampster ran away, because you're dumb
Your shirt shrunk in the wash, because it's cotton and you're dumb
  Well your toilet overflowed
You know Murph, you're not the only one that's dumb
  Who else is dumb?
Everybody
  You're right, they're all dumb

Hey you, you go to Pluh dot com because you're dumb
  Yeah, and you're downloading this song, because you're dumb
Your hemrrhoids are enflamed, because your dumb
Your brain's all stupid

[Chorus]
Oh say can you see
Everyone is dumb but me
I am never ever wrong
And that's all you'll ever beeeeeeee

People who hold out notes are dumb
The longer you do that the dumber you sound

It's daylight savings time, because you're dumb
  That guy right there is dumb, because you're dumb
One time you went to McDonalds and got some french fries
some ketchup packets, and you sat down to eat them
But you couldn't get 'em open so you went to the store
to buy some scissors but didn't have enough money so
you started running to your friends house to borrow some
money so you could buy some scissors to open up your
ketchup packets and enjoy your french fries more fully
But then just before you got to his front door
a piano fell on your head - because you're dumb
  Didn't see that one coming!!

[Chorus]

That was beautiful
  Thank you
You're still dumb
You're dumb, the song, now die
You're dead, because, you're dumb
Oh wait, you're still, alive
You're still, no dumb, the less
  ROARRRRRR
You roared cause you're dumb...

You're dumb because you thought the heavy part was over

You died while in the pit, because you're dumb
  Your funeral is boring, cause your dumb
You're six feet underground, because you're dumb
  Now you're all dead and stuff

You're dumb cause this sounds like a Deftones song
  You're dumb cause pandas are endangered
You're dumb cause everything is composed of matter
  You're dumb because, smiley face
You're dumb because this recording studio is just my closet in my appartment
(Dumb dumb dumb)
And you're dumb because
(Dumb dumb dumb)
I'm out of dumb things to say... you dummy!
