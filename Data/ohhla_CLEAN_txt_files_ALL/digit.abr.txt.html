[Verse 1]
If there's a mountain I'm a climb it like the weather
I'm finite forever
It's my night and eyesight has never been better
So why fight? Whatever
Look, my knife's a feather
When I write and I type that's my type of endeavor
So highlight the effort and mark it up with asterisks
I might be deffer than the market up on Astor Place
Sadder days are always followed by the sun
I bite off more than I can chew but then I swallow and it's done
I'm following the son
I'm seeing shadows doing flips
A lunar eclipse can turn me to a lunatic
I'm like a tuna fish on a water slide
Even in my element I think I oughta hide
Screaming like a elephant who thinks he saw some mice
It's seemingly irrelevant but links us all to fright
Afraid of a mouse
Intimidated by mice
We instigated a crisis
We're paying a price
What you're saying is nice but it's trite and lifeless
Missing inhibitions just like Dionysus
You could try to make write this
I'll make your hard core soften
I'll be sick when I'm dead, coughing in my coffin
Try to make write this, make your hard core soften
I'll be sick when I'm dead, coughing in my coffin often

[Verse 2]
You ever notice that the cleverest method that ever unfolded
Is never the mode you ever expected to better your soul?
I know it's bogus
I hold the heaviest boulder
Measure my treasure, it's better than gold
Whatever the weather I'm better than ever and never will my endeavor
Die or whatever
I'm wearin a sweater but still I'm cold
I never will meddle with general peddlers
I'm higher than Everest
Why would I ever rest?

But still I never will know a dirtier omen
Yo, I'm rollin'
They go and bury a sword
As if I'm Wart, I pull it out
I'm full of bullets now
Let's go, we're merrily rowing
Better be ready the lever's unfolding
Instead of the reveille's melody I wake up to heavenly celery soldiers
What the hell is a celery soldier?
You'll never know that you'll never be knowin

[Verse 3]
I'm the digit
Dig it like a ditch then ditch it
I fidget while snitchin on magicians
I ribbit like a frog and I rip it like a midget with scissors
Sharp like a shark with shards of glass in his jaw
All of y'all are soft as molasses in jars
I carve jargon
I'm sharp as a marksman
But the target is gone
