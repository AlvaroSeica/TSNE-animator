[Crunch Lo]
Aiyo, ten sets of fifty, ya'll niggas get with me
We bout to get gully, plan to snatch this money
Things get ugly in the hood for the goods
We been going to war, for the politics and raw
Break a nigga jaw, chop flows like a chainsaw
Here for the paper and another thing I came for
Is M.C. treachery, gas mask for my Tera Iz
Dirty Weaponry, the streets got the best of me
But on my worst day, I'm still, better than the average
Walked in a crowd, and blew myself like a Arab
Suicide bomber, I'm looking for Osama
Stick him for his dope and his power, make him build back
Them Towers, lead showers for the rule of the strip
Stay dipped, love the chrome with the two rubber grips

[Lace]
I'mma keep this on a serious tip
Let's talk about the drugs I flipped
The clips I hid, I'm the unsigned hype
Just check the blood type, got female MC's
Droppin' to they knees, like they saw God
It's a full time job to keep the streets wilding
Off my freestyling, reppin' Shaolin to the fullest
I'm spitting bullets, you lost control
You dropped your soul, 19 years on this Earth
Made the mental worse, I got suicidal thoughts
Due to hip hop's loss of real rappers, we gained slackers
Ain't it funny, how niggas talk about money
Before they cop a tail, let's keep it real
You still shitting in your diapers, you can never be like us
This is an empire that will make your life expire
