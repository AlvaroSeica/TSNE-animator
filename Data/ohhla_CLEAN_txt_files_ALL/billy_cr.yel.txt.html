Trailer parks on fire, Billy been cookin up somethin
If you need a biscuit come on then, Billy just got it jumpin
Get it from a pro, get it for the low, get you some blow
Get it for the nose, get it for the show, get it for the HOES!
Four-wheeler cranked up, gas tank on the ATV
It's full of that crank bud, Billy got pills from A to Z
So what do ya think bud? Billy won't go below fifty
22's are dangerous, trigger finger full of nugget rings
Pow, take one from the needle, how you feelin now?
Purple moons and lucky charms, yeah that's the sound
With veins turnin brown, but his fame is so profound
His name is like a noun, they goin Billy now

[Chorus: Janine Booth] + (Yelawolf) + {Rock City}
Billy's on the corner with the crystal meth
(Yeah, and he ain't slowin down, slowin down)
B-B-B-Billy's on the corner with the crystal meth
(Go Billy!) The-the-the-the crystal meth
{Ay-ay-ayy! Oh-oh-ohh! Ay-ay-ayy! Oh-ohhhhh-ohhh!}
{Oh-oh-ohh! Ay-ay-ayy! Oh-ohhhhh-ohhh!}

[Yelawolf]
Hello junkies, and hello momma too
Hello to my P.O., deuce up to the boys in blue
Billy got brass balls, twenty pounds on the catwalk
LSD and Adderall, and LCD's on the wall
He's watchin every move, high tech redneck
Run up on 'em if you want to, I bet, really?
C'mon, it might be dark in the woods (dark in the woods)
But the lights are on (lights are on)
The money's counted (money's counted) and if the price is wrong
Well then, Billy will get them +Gremlins+ like Spielberg
He'll take your house down, off of them pill-ars
And take your mom to Sizzler, and feed her chicken liver
That's cold-blooded love, Billy's a chiller

[Chorus]

[Yelawolf]
4:30 in the AM, Billy ain't slept for days
Gotta keep up with the profit, gotta keep up with the craze
It's a heavy shade (shade) gotta walk through the maze (maze)
Down where the sun don't shine, and the pine trees sway
And when the wind blew, and the cradle fell
Down come baby Billy, and up come an able male
Momma stayed at work, daddy stayed in jail
Hey that's a full deck, but you gotta play with what ya dealt
So Billy dealt the joker, put the sheriff in a choker
He drank himself sober and pissed in a supersoaker
And he wet 'em all up, and left his snow yellow
That's hard white, boy, for the L-O

[Chorus]</pre>
