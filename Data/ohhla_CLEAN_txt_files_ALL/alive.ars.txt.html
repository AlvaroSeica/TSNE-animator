[Chorus: Swel Boogie]
You can't kill the wise
We gon be here in your children's eyes
And your children's (children's) children's eyes
We was built to rise and we will survive

[Verse One: Swel Boogie]
Who's gettin shitted on?
Who's gettin shitted on?
Who's the next motherfucker to get shitted on?
'Cause if that nigga is me, then we gon get it on
Don't even smile in my face if we don't get along
Yeah that's right, I sound foul (so?)
And maybe even sound bocus, but focus
Just notice that I know how it feels to be hopeless
and homeless
But it ain't about hard times
Everybody goes through a struggle that makes ya mind craze
and you thinkin who's above you
but I get up, I don't stay down
I got lot of shit to climb, get with the time
You shit on me?  That's fine
I'm at the finish line, now you behind
We in the race and I'm droppin your horse
Everything down my road is an obsticle course
And one by one I see 'em go down
and I'm sweatin to win
Who's goin get the gold
I see the fool is bettin, it's him
So now we're toe-to-toe, eye-to-eye
Will you survive?
My crew will strive, we clever why
We never die
It's true we rise

(Chorus 2x)

[Verse Two: Jise One]
We were stranded on jungles of concrete
Primal fear scuffin my feet
where paper scuffle spear head pens
and rhymes is good to eat
Where two species of snake meet ground
Pound instinct, swamp walkin a leech
A street parasite wedgin my soul to heat
Machetero, puro latino
Hybrid with hyena
Laugh it off scrapin the blood sucka off
Racing a cheetah
key to the world
I walk, I talk in my step
Guerilla suited and fitted who chalk reps
Shitted with hearts knitted
My tribes kept and never slept
Night watch changin my shift
Just in case of deadly concepts
possess a myth that I could sniff
my prev's shadow in my perimeter
Sinister sounds at night
so I hibernate in the winter

(Chorus 2x)

[Verse Three: Q-Unique]
I stand evenly against all odds
Now at a war with the gods
so from the heavens came triggered bullets to dodge
Struggle to survive, it's never ending
My eyes locked on the bonus plan
Though adversity keeps it pendin
Food, shelter, riches, hopes, dreams, wishes
But life could be like a mixer
sometimes the fader switches
Watchin as time passes to the last sand granular
Put on to run the streets without a survival manual
I move day to day, unaware but well prepared
Digest the proper rations and framed lenses
to help my stare
exists 'cause I'm one step ahead
Never get ahead of myself
'cause one too many steps could be
one step ya dead
I've played many times with the chess master
Lost some of my pawns and sent my knights into shear
a great disaster
I stratagize right through life's highway
At the end smile with Sinatra's sureness
'cause I know I did it +my way+

(Chorus 2x)
