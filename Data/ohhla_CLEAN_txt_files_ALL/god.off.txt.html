So I have a question
A question for those people who say they believe in God
Because to believe in God, you must have defined God
You must some idea of what you've chosen to believe in
Oh, and I have the same question for the people who say they don't believe in God
Because you must have defined God
You know what it is that you've chosen not to believe in
So I don't want to know what God is, or isn't
Because I know that none of you have any idea
I just want to know where you got your information
Because it must be a good source for you to make such an important decision
And I too am seeking truth</pre>
