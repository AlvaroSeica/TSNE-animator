Uhh...
It's kinda hard when you think about the future
Realize the past really repeat, f'real
Uhh, we can see it in our music
Me, you can hear it in my beats (beats)
Yeah, they buy clothes for that old retro me
I keep it retro with my feet, yeah
So much for that soul that's gone (gone)
I guess I'll put it on repeat (repeat)
Repeat yeah, I love this music (music)
So don't ask me why I use it (I use it)
I use it for my personal outlet
Outlet's ma how I don't confuse it (confuse it)
One day you hot, the next day you not
Spoke about it with a lawyer who was Jewish
Consulted with him, about why do this again
Watch it the only way you watch it is keep it blue-ish (blue-ish)
Well, I keep a celly for the time
When I accesorize, I'm the subtle kind who do it
Probably cause, my money ain't long
And loans ain't paid off but ain't got shit to do with music
Hardly; music 'posed to represent life
And for now, life is a big party
So as I regulate the party (party)
I turn heads and make a move like a {?}
It's kind of hard when you think about the future
Realize the past really repeat, f'real
Yeah, we can hear it in our music
Me especially, up in my beats (yeah)
They buy clothes, for that old retro (retro)
I keep it retro on my feet (on my feet)
Yeah, so much for that sole that's gone
Gone, I put it on repeat (repeat)
Repeace, repeace</pre>
