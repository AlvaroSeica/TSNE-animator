[Intro: Bizarre]
Brothers and sisters
We're gonna have church tonight
And tonight this speaker is, Reverend Rufus Jackson

[Chorus: Bizarre Â– singing]
I wake up praisin, God every day
I wanna, smoke some weed and, roll me a J
Thank you Jesus! (Thank you Jesus!) Thank you Lord! (Thank you Lord!)
For lettin me, live another day - hey, hey!

[Bizarre]
Nigga I'm high, nigga you high (uh-huh)
Let's get higher than the motherfuckin sky (ha ha)
Watch the butterflies hit the wall
And if you're feelin down, give your boy a call
Weed, it takes the stress away
That's why Bizarre smokes ten blunts a day
It's nothin but the sticky-icky green stuff
Light it, pass it, and take a puff
Havin a bad day? Stop by my house
Cause most likely, I got a blunt in my mouth
So sit down, relax and chill
And if ya don't smoke weed, then shit I got some pills
What'cha need girl, a fuckin refill?
A fat bag of weed and some Happy Meals?
Nah baby, I don't smoke Newports
Only fat bags of weed in this Escort

[Chorus]

[Bizarre]
Sunday morning, Bizarre half baked
Blunt in my mouth, watchin TJ Drake
+Dangerous Mind+, just like Coolio
Only church I know, is Snoop Dogg's studio
White owls, wraps, rollin in my lap
Rap Hennessy, get the acid tab's
I'm glad, that I didn't go Down South
Take care of my kids, be the man of the house
Orange mushrooms, and yellow stars
Fat bags of Guido's in mason jars
Get in the 'llac, c'mon jump in
Bring a bottle of gin and two of your freaky friends
Oh fuck it, let's go to see the point
Bring your son along, shit, he can hit the joint
Cause rappin, it's a full-time job
All I wanna smoke weed and praise God, yeah

[Chorus]

[Interlude: Bizarre]
Break it down, yeah
We gon' slow it down right here
We're havin church up in here tonight
It's the Reverend Rufus Johnson
And we're sittin over here, at sixteen-five-oh, Coney
And ladies and gentlemen, come and, praise God with us!

[Chorus]

[Bizarre - over Chorus]
Sayin grace
Baptist, Catholic, Jehovah Witness, Tabernacle
Yeah, come praise God
Yeah, services, send it, at 4:20
Brothers and sisters send it at 4:20

[Outro: Bizarre]
C'mon, praise God
Just cause you smoke weed don't mean you a sinner, what?
Just cause you smoke weed don't mean you don't believe in God
Jesus will take care of ya!
Jesus, you need Jesus
