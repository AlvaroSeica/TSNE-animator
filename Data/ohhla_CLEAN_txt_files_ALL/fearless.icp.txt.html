Song:   Fearless
Typed by: daimon@get2net.dk

Are you scared? (Fearless!)
Are you scared? (Are you frightened you little bitch?)

Chorus 2x
What's the matter
What's the matter
what's the matter (Are you scared of ghosts?)
what's the matter
What's the matter
Tell me are you fearless (I'm not scared of ghosts)

I'll go to Alaska, bitch slap a polar bear and take its food
I'll mow the fuckin lawn, on a land mine field like what boom
I'll roll a m-80 up in some papers and smoke that shit up
I'll share a dirty heroin needle with that dirty bitch Courtney Love
I'll run around the white house lawn naked and screamin and bustin shots at him
I'll scratch my back with a chain saw oh yeah got it
I'll walk through comton alone and sport wranglers and a cowboy hat
I'll head-butt a fuckin unicorn come here bitch (No! *Thumb* Damn!)
I'll stand on a stump and let you trim my toenails with a axe
I'll sucker punch a gorilla and then try to run with a banana hangin out my ass
I'll fuckin become pen-pals with the unibomber and let him send me packages
I'll drive a ice cream truck through eithiopia talkin about free ice cream sandwiches

Chorus 2x
What's the matter
What's the matter
what's the matter (are you scared)
what's the matter
What's the matter
Tell me are you fearless (Don't be scared)

I'll let Sam Kinison borrow my car if he was still around
I'll bungee jump off a crane with only a spaghetti noodle tied on
I'll clinch my butt cheeks shut while a ruthless alien trying to probe me
I'll receive an operation on my eyeball while riding in a dune buggy
I'll finger fuck a toilet and French kiss a light socket
I'll pick up a hooker with a deep voice ("I'm Jenny!") (Naw! No I wouldn't)
I'll take all my clothes off and run up and bear hug a cactus
I'll sneak up to slick rick and snatch off his eye patch
I'll eat a bowl of cluster bombs and spread jellyfish on my toast
I'll fuckin grease my ass up and sit on top of a flag post
I'll shoot a game of pool with the grim reaper and then let him beat me
I'll meet Jeffrey Dahmer at some kinda of bar let him take me home and eat me

Chorus 2x
What's the matter
What's the matter
what's the matter (are you scared?)
what's the matter
What's the matter
Tell me are you fearless (Don't be scared!)

I'll through gang signs at the booya tribe up and downs like whut
I'll hunt Michael Jackson's plastic surgeon tell him hey do me up
I'll put my lips on a 81' novas exhaust pipe and smoke that fucker
I'll fuck a chick raw with crabs so big red lobsters tryin to catch'em
I'll start a record label and base everything I got on M.C. Hammer
I'll wear a pink bikini thong and walk right through the slammer
I'll take a chrome desert eagle 45 put it to the dome and dump it
I'll go to a big ass b hive on a tree, drop my drawers and hump it

Chorus 3x
What's the matter
What's the matter
what's the matter (are you scared)
what's the matter
What's the matter
Tell me are you fearless (Don't be scared)
