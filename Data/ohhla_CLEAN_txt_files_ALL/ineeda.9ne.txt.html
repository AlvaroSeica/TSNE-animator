Typed by: AZ Lyrics

In heaven but the hell still with me
Cops pull us over yo my name Bill Bixby
That meaning a blink, I'ma do the opposite of shrink
And bink ya but I do not want to clink,
I need a drink vodka, cognac, rum, whiskey beer and tequila
I don't wanna think, I need a drink
Whether wine, or moonshine, whatever
I'm just trying to ease my mind
I need a

Big fucking cup, shit's fucking up, this fucking sucks
Everybody broke cause they no job
Cris stuff and puff, lit up and huff
Pissed cuss and fuss
Everybody told one and go rob
Mama need John Knox village
And that's a lot of cheese from my skillet
But that don't matter though cause for mamas health you know money gotta go
Radical, stab ya, no but me and the gat is compatible
I don't know why these employers ain't calling me
Constantly, stalling me, fuck this economy preacher be telling me read Deuteronomy,
But in all honesty, it fucking astonish me
When we broke nigga, looked at as a joke nigga
But I'm a go getter, hop up like a fourwheeler
The jacker dope dealer, run up in your hood
Chopping all stood with the 'k till it was all good

In heaven but the hell still with me
Cops pull us over yo my name Bill Bixby
That meaning a blink, I'ma do the opposite of shrink
An bink ya but I do not want to clink,
I need a drink vodka, cognac, rum, whisk beer and tequila
I don't wanna think, I need a drink
Whether wine, or moonshine, whatever
I'm just trying to ease my mind
I need a

Club so I can just geek, just get to it
Now I'm ducking every pig cause my nig blew it
And how we sangin' on a nigga ain't a funny sight
I still gotta get my motherfucking money right
Hella strong I put the I in might
Take a chunk out off a stunner with the lion's bite
Fuck signal with nothing I ain't about to cry and gripe
Just gonna live my every day like the Mayans right
I ain't bullshitting, I'm a lost soul
My kids growing and they need shits that cost dough
My homie got shot right outside ofâ¦
I need a cross yo,

I need a drink vodka, cognac, rum, whiskey, beer tequila
I don't wanna think, I need a drink
Whether wine, a moonshine, whatever
I'm just trying to ease my mind
I need a</pre>
