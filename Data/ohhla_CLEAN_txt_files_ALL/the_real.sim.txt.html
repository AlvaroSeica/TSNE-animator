[Verse 1] (Guilty Simpson)
Mama got bills
Papa got ghost
My new father figure's popping that toast
On the corner where the dopeman boast
Arguing who got the most
Barely got a pot for roast
(Starving)
But always have pots for coke
When you're broke the hood got jokes
A lot of brothers doing good got smoked
Many blood stains paint the ave
Makes you wonder what choice we have
(Not many)
I chose not to take that path
I ain't trying to feel the DA's wrath
So I push it on the freeway fast
Trying to see another b-day pass
Some think my success won't last
Still I go hard and get cash

[Hook]
Since you don't know
It's Guilty you feel me
My foes want to kill me
I can feel it
One day you gotta go
And I know
But the dough got me dreaming of filthy
I'm'a get it
Since you don't know
Just pop in the disc and you gettin' the real me
I'm the realest

[Verse 2] (Guilty Simpson)
My friend got killed
His girl got problems
She saw what happened when they robbed him
The block got eyes and ears
The strong survive so dry your tears
Be leery of the guys you speak with
Showing emotion is a sign of weakness
And that's deep shit
Sometimes the ones you beef with are the ones you eat with
And that's sad to say
I hate it that your friends gotta act that way
Money is the roof when you stack that pay
They want to do you like MLK
Catch you on the balcony
Shoot you in the head
Face down dead
Take all your bread
Haters got setups to murk you ballers
That's why I had to make my circle smaller

[Hook]
Since you don't know
It's Guilty you feel me
My foes want to kill me
I can feel it
One day you gotta go
And I know
But the dough got me dreaming of filthy
I'm'a get it
Since you don't know
Just pop in the disc and you gettin' the real me
I'm the realest</pre>
