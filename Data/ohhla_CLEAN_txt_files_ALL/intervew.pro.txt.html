[Interviewer]
Our guest live on This House is the world's famous Apollo Theater
Professor Griff of Public Enemy

"Check this out" ---&gt; Chuck D

[Professor Griff]
I'm speakin' out, to address the nation
To reject and correct false information
Don't believe the hype and the lies you've been fed
Half the motherfuckers don't know what I
Say what I feel 'cause I'm grown
And if you live in a glass house then don't throw stones
This fax was fact and now I'm batted 'cause I'm black
I educate the blind
That's why they label me a nigga with a radical mind
Label you givin' won't stick to me
And if I don't make another dime
It won't mean shit to me

[Interviewer]
We're going to take a very quick break
But come back take some phone calls from you
And our listening audience at W-K-M-A
Our number here is 5-1-6-8-6-7-9-7-8-5
We'll be right back

"Hit it"

[Professor Griff]
You quick to judge in the essence of fairness
A message sense to enhance black awareness
There's freedom of speech, but when you're black you're limited
A G-O-P to keep your mind primitive
Statements I made were misquoted, misread
As a result a lot of people were misled
They let Jim Bakker lie from the pulpit
I speak out once, you jump, that's bullshit
Prove me wrong instead of dissing me
I expose the plan and now you miss me
No time for despair, you'll single the white fan
Get involved and get with the Griff plan

[Interviewer]
I want to ask you, without getting into what you said specifically
I'm curious to know
Why would you single out one group of people?
And what has this taught you about the media and the music industry?

[Professor Griff]
M.T.V. jumped on the bandwagon
Entertainment Tonight said I was only braggin'
Meanwhile back at the camp it was critical
Now I see why they say 'Griff's political'
Remember, I never said I lied
Chuck D answered the question 'Why'
Rappers who said they were down to the end
When the shit hit the fan they got in the wind
As Judas hatched his master plan
I bet you didn't know David Mills was a black man

[Interviewer]
We're going to take a short break and we'll be right back
With Professor Griff to answer your phone calls
So Griff, do you think what happened is going to stop rap
From saying what perhaps needs to be said to our community
Especially to our African young men

[Professor Griff]
No because there's a lesson to be learned to all of this
This is our way to communicate to our youth

[Interviewer]
So, Professor Griff, you are Minister of Information
With the rap group Public Enemy
So, has that relationship between yourself
Chuck D, Flavor Flav and Hank Shocklee
Is that now irreparable

[Professor Griff]
No, I believe we can um, keep the group together

[Interviewer]
Now, can Public Enemy be as it was?
Are the rap artists being asked by their labels to
Condemn Professor Griff like we saw with Farrakhan
Has it gotten to that level yet

[Professor Griff]
No, the rap artists have to be strong as they are
I respect all of the rap artists
To everyone in the industry
I'd just like to say, peace
Positive Education Always Corrects Errors
Thank you, I'm takin' two steps, I'm outta here</pre>
