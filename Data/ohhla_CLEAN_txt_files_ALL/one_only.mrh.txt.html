[Intro - Mariah Carey]
I'm looking for my one and only
Every time I turn around
I find my heart in pieces on the ground
So so lonely
I'm lookin' for my one and only

[Mariah Carey]
I'm riding home in pain again baby
But that don't mean shit to you
You're currently engaged
In an intimate conversation
With a young groupie or two
They say players only love you
When they're playing games
Still I gave my heart to you
I should have stayed away-a-a-a
Like my friends all told me to

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
Every time I turn around
I find my heart in pieces on the ground
So, so lonely
I'm lookin' for my one and only
Every time I turn around
I find my heart in pieces on the ground
Why can't I find my one and only

[Mariah Carey]
See I'm looking for a man that'll rub me slow
Make me sing real high
When he goes down low
But see it ain't just a physical thing
He's gotta treat me affectionately
And I gotta know he won't betray my trust
Just like every other motherfucker does
Is this just an impossible dream baby
To elusive to pursue
It's been such a sad and windy road for me
Just searching for the truth

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]

[Twista]
Now ya know I'm rollin' Beamer and a Benz
And I'm dishin' out ends
Why you hatin' on a playa, baller
Havin' better conversations while we rollin' on twenty fo's
And I know ya got doubts
Why ya listen to what people talk about
Ya ain't figured out why they call ya
The heifer steady hatin' cuz you rollin' on twenty fo's
See how ya money flow
Ya dressed in designer clothes from head to the toe
Ya ain't satisfied then tell me what ya lookin' fo'
(Mariah Carey: I'm lookin' for my one and only)
Well I'll be ya one and only
If ya give me a chance I'll make a change fo' ya girl
I know I ain't been the most faithful nigga in the world
But let's stay together so we can shine like pearls
Spendin' to a wallet, fill a Swisha with fire
To kiss ya lips I desire
Twist and Mariah, together like a rim and a tire
(Mariah Carey: I'm lookin' for my one and only)
Well come on shorty let me make it better
We can do whatever, while we sittin' on suede and leather
Feelin' through the city while we rollin' chrome and
Let's kick it in the Chi, I know I messed up with you I ain't gon' lie
I knew you was feelin', you really know yo guy
But baby girl I ain't mean to blow your high
Let me pick the pieces up and put em' back together
Cuz I wanna be with you, don't wanna leave you lonely
Ride with you like the homie, never no phony
Shorty can I be ya one and only

[Chorus: Mariah Carey (with variations) to fade]</pre>
