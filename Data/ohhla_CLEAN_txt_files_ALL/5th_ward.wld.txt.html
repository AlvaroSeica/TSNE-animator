[DJ Ready Red]
Yo Will, the word out in the street, man 
You're high-capping now, since you got your new album coming out

[Willie D]
Ain't that a bitch? 
You know goddamn well I'm on that other level

[Verse One: Willie D]
When I left my neighborhood, to make this big break
I promised my road dogs, that I'd dedicate
A super jam to the hood, that's sharp as a sickle
So here it is, 5th Ward, better known as the Nickel
Everybody know my hood, they say it's no good
But they don't talk that shit in my neck of the woods
We ain't got the homes and fancy rides
So the only thing we have to fight for is our pride
Washington Armstrong, May Wessels and Williams
Robinson and Thomas Tobes, we're all be chilling
But when a sucker starts illing, the chilling disrupts
And like Kim Rhodes we tear their ass up, in the Ward!

[Chorus: DJ Ready Red scratching Excerpts below]
Don't don't don't FUCK WITH ME! ------&gt; Al Pacino as Tony Montana
Fifth Fifth Fifth Ward!  --------&gt; Prince Johnny C
Make a move and you're dead --------&gt; Prince Johnny C
Don't don't don't FUCK WITH ME! ------&gt; Al Pacino as Tony Montana
Fifth Fifth Fifth Ward! --------&gt; Prince Johnny C
I'm down with J.. Fifth Fifth Fifth Ward! --------&gt; Prince Johnny C
Make a move and you're dead --------&gt; Prince Johnny C 

[Verse Two: Willie D]
Crack is sold on the main road to brothers that bold
The police come around but they ain't got no control
You can get an ounce, in Powder's Coffee
And you can buy pussy 24-hours a day
Whores track you down as you cruise the streets
Jump in a car with any motherfucking body than me
Before you can make it to the block and stop
Dead sure your ass licking nuts and sucking cock for a rock
They don't give a damn who you are in society
As long as you got the damn money 
Watch your back, stash your crack because you might get jacked
We got some vicious bitches trained to attack
You keep away from The Ward

[Willie D]
Yo Ready Red, why don't you tell these soft-hearted, fake-ass
Dookie in the bootied-peanut patted face, whore-ass motherfuckers
What Fifth Ward is boy

Hard, Hard, Hard, Hard, as hell 
Hard, Hard, Hard, Hard... ----&gt; LL Cool J

[Willie D]
Aiy child, where your little punk-ass brother at?

[DJ Ready Red]
Oh! nigga, I don't know what the fuck you're talking about
The last time I've seen your punk-ass brother;
He was playing with a motherfucking G-I Joe.

[Willie D]
Wait a minute motherfucker, let me tell your black-ass something.

[Verse Three: Willie D]
My little brother threw away his G-I Joe
He don't pack a launch kiddy, he pack a forty four
He says the steel ain't his meal, he only use it with Jones
But every time he comes home, he has a different Dookie on
Maybe I've influenced him, some say I've ruined him
But they ain't never been in my shoes
So yo, Fuck them, cause I'm pushing pussies down the city hog
I blame them, should hang them for all this damn term on
They got the power to reconstruct, but don't give a fuck
About the ones who are stuck, my zipper is down cause they suck
I've voted and voted to do a way with the negligence
I ain't going no war for the shit talking president
The demon is scheming, but his masses glad
My people is crying and dying while he sits on his regal-ass
Laugh motherfucker but your dentures are fraud
Cause see, you're gonna get yours if you ever come to The Ward

[Break: DJ Ready Red]
Yo D man, what's with these stupid motherfuckers? 
Talking about what hood they're from and shit
Calling us Meat-heads, ain't that hurts?
Fifth Ward don't produce no motherfucking nerds
Man, what I want you to do for me, man
Is talk about these bitch-ass motherfuckers, spitting louder of nothing
Man, put these motherfuckers on the spot 
Because this goddamn shit has got to stop

[Verse Four: Willie D]
Keeping them honors, Jessy Thomas don't you worry I promise
They say we're Meat-heads, I guess that makes their vaginas
They can't get honor, that's just that high-capping shear
They come with shotguns, ?? got them because they think I'm from here
They fear incarceration, not because of freedom
But how do the penitentiary pimps, are gonna greet them
Walk around the free world, with the guns they can ??
Behind the walls they loose the balls, and also the ass
I know you're type that like to fight, but don't walk alone
Always running with a thousand motherfucking morons
Ready Red gotta come for you (It ain't enough for you)
I'll tell you what do, you better not come to the Ward!

[Break: Willie D]
That's right motherfuckers!
You come for the Ward, you can't help but being hard
So don't be taking your stupid-ass down here
Thinking you're gonna run something with that whore shit
Cause we'll fuck around and be shipping your ass back
To your freak-dog baldheaded-ass mama
Keep away from the Ward!

[Chorus]
