[Intro] [Illogic speaking]
Mean bars it's mean things. It's real focused and mean
You know, it's how you just gotta go, just go all the way in
You know. Uh huh. Yeah

[Verse One] [Blueprint]
What the fuck I'm holding back for it's time to bring it?
Waitin' on a record deal is like waitin' for FEMA
After what I been through, man, they can keep it
I'd rather stay up in my basement makin' heaters
I used to battle rap, face to face with a rapper
You on Youtube, talkin' tough to a camera
Everybody got goons and they clappin' hammers
You diss him, he diss you but don't nothin' happen
Last week you was in the hood duckin' cops
This week you wrote about it all in your blog
You don't wanna do music man, you wanna talk
Proppin' up an album that we all know ain't gonna drop
Shit sound like the dead of winter when it's cold
When you look out doors and all you see is snow
You can't escape it or feel it all up in your bones
Nowhere else to go, so I'ma put it in my songs
While other cats is out playin' on vacation
I'm stuck in Bust Town playin' on my Playstation
Mad at this damn game cause I can't exchange it
And my state lost the most jobs in the nation
It's much bigger than a couple rappers makin' paper
Or even independent hip hop versus major
Y'all ain't sayin' things the common man can relate to
But instead of listenin' you'd rather cause tales
I'm out

[Chorus] [Illogic] [x2]
Cold out here, man it's cold
It's cold out here, man it's cold
It's cold out here, man it's cold
It's cold out here, man it's cold
It's cold
Cold

[Verse Two] [Illogic]
You think tomorrow is a promised but it's only a request
So why you payin' homage, be sure to watch your step
The people you acknowledge and those you haven't met
Are on the lookout
Hopin' that you fall to your death
Didn't want to see me make moves because they're stagnant
I'm droppin' off my luggage while they're gatherin' more baggage
Their progress is sluggish, I maneuver fantastic
The gridlock, I rise above it, they're fighting the traffic
They only see the dunk, they don't see the assist
They say all I have is luck, but I worked hard for this
It's hard to stay grounded cause I'm not scared of flyin'
The only thing that causes me fear is not tryin'
They criticize the steps I make but they don't bother
I stepped out on faith and now I'm walkin' on the water
My wife is proud to follow me, I'm happy as I wanna be
You thought you caught up with me but now I'm where you wanna be
A message to my legacy
Be the silver lining
Even if you fall on your face, just keep grindin'
They need to re-channel all the energy they hate with
The world is on my shoulders but I told you that I'm Weightless

[Chorus] [Illogic] [x2]
Cold out here, man it's cold
It's cold out here, man it's cold
It's cold out here, man it's cold
It's cold out here, man it's cold
It's cold
Cold

[Verse Three] [The Catalyst]
I spent most of my nights gettin' drunk up at some night club
Can't even get up into V.I.P. from my buzz
I got a cloud over me that's too dark to see tomorrow
Like it inserted the darkness where the sunlight was
With the hope that one day I get my shit in the stores
I'm trying to blow up B.I.G. and +Kick In The Door+
But when I think I got control it's like Bo verse ten of me
Ed Norton in Fight Club, my own worst enemy
But, the Tyler Durden inside my persons 
Is harder to break than the modern version of the Iron Curtain
To plead the code I keep the throne like a fire burnin'
Sippin' Remy with an Ice Cube in it for Higher Learnin'
See ya boy is so nice even when bitin' verses
I add to it with some new shit that'll improve it
Blastin' my music sippin' bourbon and Hennessy
Well, swervin' the SUV while I'm turnin' on Refugee
Feelin' like Moses
I find myself lookin' at a bush on fire when I be burnin' an effigy
Go figure, it's either me and this Con liquor
Or Lady Liberty is the epitome of gold digger
A cold winter, makin' my bones shiver
But it's cool, cause dudes can't follow my steps if the snow thicker
Luckily for you we heatin' the globe quicker
So get yours while you can before it explode nigga

[Chorus] [Illogic] [x2]
Cold out here, man it's cold
It's cold out here, man it's cold
It's cold out here, man it's cold
It's cold out here, man it's cold
It's cold
Cold</pre>
