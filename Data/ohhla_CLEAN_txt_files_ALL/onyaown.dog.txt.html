[Mr. D.O.G.]
So he's like, "What's goin on?"
I said, "Aw nuttin y'know just comin through I was lookin for somethin"
Said, "What do you want?" I said, "Well y'all don't have it"
He said, "Alright I'll see you later" so I run out
And down the block my crew was waitin
And they was like, "Umm - what's good?"
I said, "Naw we can't, we can't do this"
"Why not? It's two people in there"
I said, "We can't do this, and I'll explain it later"
So we left, y'know, a lot of them was like
"We don't care who he is, and who they are, and.. y'know anybody goes"
And I'm like, "Yo my man, this one here is, you're on your own"
"Cause these are some bad dudes"</pre>
