Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
Looking like a star like a diamond
Something like a star girl you're shining
You got all that I need
Baby you got all that I need
Looking like a star like a diamond
Something like a star girl you're shining
You got all that I need
Baby you got all that I need

Wishing I could change your mind yeah
I wish that you could see yourself through my eyes, girl
You would see that you're my star
My queen, my heart
Yeah I pull the star down for you
'Cause you are, you are, you are
Like rain in July love form the sky y
You are
Like uhh, uh you know

[Chorus]
Looking like a star like a diamond
Something like a star girl you're shining
You got all that I need
Baby you got all that I need
Looking like a star like a diamond
Something like a star girl you're shining
You got all that I need
Baby you got all that I need

You look in the mirror and smile
Do you feel like I feel right now yeah
I pray to know that you're my star
My queen, my heart
And I would shade it all for you
'Cause you are, you are, you are
Like cold on the pillow
Look here what you did to
You are
Like uhh, break it down

[Chorus]</pre>
