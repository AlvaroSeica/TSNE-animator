[Intro]
You stand here beside me, and all the times you just pretend
To be my friend...

[Krayzie]
Nigga get your hands up out my fuckin' pockets before I cock
This A.K. fo' seven and rott your body (might...) opposites
Plottin' niggaz don't think I'm watchin' get 'em in my scope
They say keep it, enemies in focus, watch 'em closely
Niggaz that takin' a roll in it comes in a (?) slowly cause of the
Money man and that can be a dangerous thing cause when they
Play with the paper Krayzie go loco insane my nigga I just
Let you hang so quit tryin' to mothafuckin' sue my brotha
Nigga cause I just now met ya so don't play me to close
So keep your distance cause I'll split ya, for tryin' to
Infitrate mine what about my nickel plate nine these niggaz
Ain't no friends of mine niggaz get drunk and tell you they
Love you twenty-five times in one night next thing you know
Niggaz is kickin' in your door for your life, got your wife
And your kids, and your crib this your shit you see he was
Fuckin' around with them suckas and you started trustin'
The mothafuckas nigga don't you know, you can't trust no one
At all cause that one might be the one that get you bring
You down, make you fall

[Chorus]
What's friends (what's friends)
I don't want no more friends (no more friends)
I don't need no more friends (no more friends)
I can't take no more friends
Because they always end up back stabbin' in the end
What's friends (what's friends) (*X2*)

[Layzie]
This is strange shit if he'd explain shit don't act like you'd
Understand this like we would be on some lame shit I read it all
In your conversation you think I didn't pin your player hation
Gotta nigga thinkin' Mo Murda when I face him put him on down
With a real situation, take 'em nigga this how we take 'em dog
Nigga will sing us with song nigga will spin us what's wrong
It's all real (real) you haters was born to piss me off
Or kill (kill) nigga we comin' to break you off nigga break you
Off somethin' proper (proper) you used to be my nigga now I might
Have to watch ya, ghetto bird snitchin' like a helicopter so when
You see me comin' dog I might have to pop ya (pop ya)

[Chorus]

What's friends (what's friends)
I don't want no more friends (no more friends)
I don't need no more friends (no more friends)
I can't take no more friends
Because they always end up back stabbin' in the end
What's friends (what's friends) (*X2*)


[Bizzy]

Because they always end up back stabbin' in the end
What's friends (what's friends) (*X4*)</pre>
