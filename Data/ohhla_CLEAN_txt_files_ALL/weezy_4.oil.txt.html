Y'know New York comin back business y'knahmsayin?

Because the whole shit the whole shit is
All we gotta do is be us, man y'knahmsayin?
Let hip-hop do what the fuck it do mayne y'knahmean?

Just livin that man, dress style is still the same B, y'knahmean?
We ain't wear them Lees pleated any more
But we still doin what we do kid, y'knahmean?
Y'know I don't put my sock under my Puma no more
But I'm still keepin it trim and fresh you dig?
So you know it is what it is man y'knahmsayin?
If you love hip-hop and it's in your heart man
This thing's gonna live on forever and ever man
This the first music to ever happen in a life
That where people, that that listen to hip-hop, y-your grandson
Your grandmother listen to the same song that the grandkid listen to
Man that ain't ever happened in all the world B, y'knahmean?
This hip-hop kid</pre>
