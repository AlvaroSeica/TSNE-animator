[Intro: Hodgy Beats]
Hehehehe
Super 3! O.F.
Yes, uhhh

[Hodgy Beats]
Save all your letters and drop your tomatoes
Hodgy Beats, with heat, lookin for a large payroll
Not dimes, nickels, pennies, pesos
I'm tryin to stack chips nigga, peelin my potatoes
If I'm not the biggest boss that you've see thus far
take a look at the exquisite, luxury cars
Big ponts being stuck into a Cuban cigar
Promethazine on the leaf only to get bizarre
We don't go to the club nigga, we post at the bar
Have conversation with girls that don't, know who we are
With diamonds in our ears lookin like cube stars
I live a Matrix life and we cruise hard

[Chorus: Casey Veggies]
And I swear I'm a fiend, dope fiend, I'm an addict
Crack music going hard, Odd Future gotta bag it
And I swear I'm a fiend, dope fiend, I'm an addict
Crack music going hard, Odd Future gotta bag it
Yeah~! Make it stretch like bubble gum {*3X*}
Eh, all the little females like yummy yum

[Tyler, the Creator]
Now ugly girls get out, the light skinned girls about
Without a doubt you niggaz don't amount to shit no need to count
Now bring the ruler out like +Rick the Ruler+ paid in full
I'm cooler than your cooler, got these hoes, now where's my garden tool
Fuck 'em all, all them fuck with the +Future+
+Odd+ back with thrash hard, backyard beach cruiser, look
You niggaz can't contain the thoughts that's flowin in my brain
it synthesizes skits on neutrons from steering paper plane
And the white girls love me, and the haters shove me
and push me until I beat the pussy up like it was ugly
And that's without the loot, niggaz take the time to tune
the diamond dollars bitch I'm complex like Einstein's Rubix Cube
Look I'm the truth, now stop daring me
Niggaz kill yourself and decide to go back to therapy
And my right is right, my right is left, my left is wrong
Now bitches throw your fuckin bras off while I'll be writing my songs

[Chorus]

[Hodgy Beats]
Gimme a couple commas while I abbreviate
The war between the pen and paper I alleviate
+Alexander+ is Hodgy, cause I can be the +Great+
as long as I have a hundred mill' in the cheese steak
In a big briefcase like I won a sweepstakes
Odd Future got money out the ass for G's sakes
I feel like I can fly without wings on my back
This is crack with me but this crack ain't whack
I got niggaz hooked, yeah the stadium packed
And I flip that, like a gymnasium mat
It's grind time, and I'm makin it stretch
Why get less for more when you can get more for less
Pure for less, down
Five three eight two thousand and press send
If you comprehend, what I recommend press send
If you comprehend what I recommend
Odd Future... {*long instrumental pause*}

[Chorus]</pre>
