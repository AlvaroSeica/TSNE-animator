[Thes One]
I might call your spot pumpin' if you got crushed ice
In a styrofoam cup with the refill rights
So homie no time to chill we got places to try
I gotta find some grilled onions and a large side of fries
Some guys are mad smart, some guys are tough dudes
But me and my homies we mostly care about food
Got spots to peruse and never choosin' McDonald's
I'm talkin Al's cheesteaks, Dino's and Chano's
Tomy's on Pico, Hi-Life in Pasadena
Man and Lucky Boy too and I can't forget Arena
Wilson Burger by PCH in Hawthorne
And right around the corner is Y-Not, it's awesome
Melrose got Astro's and that's that
I only mess with Fat Burger if your fries are fat
Now Whittier you got Ruby's they're renowned for their shakes
It's like the Claim Jumper pilin up the food on your plate
Wait, now better yet let me tell you 'bout that Busy Bee
You get the Belly Busterthe chicken or the pastrami
Tommy's on the late night, Eat Well for breakfast
And Fritto Misto with my ladygnocchi's the best dish
Shout to Papadakis, Lighthouse and a Waffle House
Fantastic Cafe and Pronto they rule the South
Word to your mouth until the next Phillippe's
Yo I'm out on the streets looking for something to eat

[Double K]
When I'm chillin' I'd rather be grillin
Gimme a plate of the flavor and Mike starts stealin'
Now if I ain't squeezin lemon on the roast chicken
I'm jumpin on the row like the fast food villain
Burgers I be killin, tomatoes and all
I be coolin in the food court of your favorite mall
Buyin' brunch like it was weight, throw it in the back of the trunk
I'm off to Tom's #2 to get me some lunch
Ten beef tacos, señor. Extra cheese.
And the chips that you got at the store, lookie here
Now I just passed Oki-Dog, I'm headed toward Lucy's
Passed the Roscoe'sthey can keep them waffles
In the distance I see a place they call El Rey
Home of the garbage burrito and if not then hit Benito's
Taquitos for days and a big bag of Lay's
Wash it down with a soft drink, hmm, let me think
I head down west to the A-1 Burger
Where the french fries are fresh and you might get murdered
Or what about Johnny's pastramis and shakes
So you can hit Chabelita's for the midnight break
After the club spend a dub and you can feed your crew
On any given day this is what I might do
Go place a order, then wait, pick it up</pre>
