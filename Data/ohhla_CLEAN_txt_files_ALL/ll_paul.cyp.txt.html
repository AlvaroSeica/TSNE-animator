Latin Lingo - "Here comes the pain!"

[Sen Dog]
I freak to the funk that no-one else is bringin
Sen Dog with the funky bilingüe
Yeah that's the nombre, heard that homey?
Peace to Mellow and Frost, and the deporte
Sen Dog is not a kid or veterano
I'm down, another fried Hispano
One of the many of the Latins este año
And I got plenty for the Jennies tryin to hound yo
But wait, they're clownin on me cause of my language
I have to tell em straight up, it's called spanglish
Now who's on the fiend, gala gringo?
Tryin to get paid, from the funky bilingual

[Chorus: B-Real &amp; Sen Dog]
Latin lingo baby (funky bilingual) funky bilingual
Yeah, funky bilingual!
Latin lingo baby (funky bilingual) funky bilingual
It's the Latin lingo!

[Sen Dog]
Cuando entros, when I come in, the suckers fronted
They mida, another bilingual from bein
Tengo, como ejemplo, check the tempo
Ahh, esta chingon el instrumento
Ya no usted, como somos
Yo no jovo, I gots my soul though
And you can hear it, in las skonkas
Tribal ceremony as the Hill gets stronger
Don't be such a leper what you got for la cabeza
Hey homes, pass the cerveza
Before I have to go and push up on your resa
Hmm, she's fine, something fresca
Here homes have a hit of this yesca
Dicho enseño, the lingua la prento
Now you know, that I am in the centro
Where you live, si tu puedes
Nowadays you ain't shit without your puentes
Something like a gang thang, vatos get it BANG, BANG
Could of hung out with them now you callin me a insane
Senta la mi cara, senta mi camino
Make way (yeah) for the funky bilingual

[Chorus: B-Real &amp; Sen Dog]
Latin lingo baby (funky bilingual) funky bilingual
Funky bilinguals hoe!
Latin lingo baby (funky bilingual) funky bilingual
It's the Latin lingo, baby!
Latin lingo baby (funky bilingual) funky bilingual
Funky bilingual...
Some of that old Latin funk, knowhatI'msayin?

[Sen Dog]
(What's up homey? Don't you know me?) Si mon
(Ain't you the brother of the mas pingo?)
Straight up, and I'm down with La Raza
Kid Frost got my back, BOO-YAA's en la casa
Cause everyday things get a little crazier
As I step to the microphone area
First I claim my city, puro los angeles
Yeah (you know homes) that's where the calles is
Vato wouldn't know me, along with the heinas
Catchin all them slippin, for they such a one-timer
So when you see me at the party or the baile
Before I got here I was gaffled in the calle
Troop like a vacho who said I was borracho
Had an attitude, tried to play me macho
Just relax, calmado mijo
Sen Dog with the funky bilingual

[Chorus: B-Real &amp; Sen Dog]
Latin lingo baby, funky bilingual
Funky bilingual
Latin lingo baby, funky bilingual
Funky bilingual
Latin lingo baby, funky bilingual
Funky bilingual... funky baby!

Yeah, I'd like to say peace, to my homeboy B-Real
Mellow Man Ace, Kid Frost, and Ralph M the Mexican
And we're out</pre>
