Song:   Learn My Lesson
Typed by: OHHLA

No, I don't think I could confess to sin
and I scratch my mind, cause the question is
when will I learn my lesson, when will I learn my lesson
I just stride for the best of things,
and I scratch my mind, cause the question is
(what's the question?)
when will I learn my lesson, when will I learn my lesson

I never learn the mental persons spendings earning nightly
complains when the rent is burning pockets in his nice jeans, blimey
the one who's quick to mock a person's styley
or didn't stop to clock the person standing right behind me
yeah, very quick to hit the snooze on his alarm clock
or thinks it's pretty stupid why he's booted from his last job
ticket guy will come to check your park spot (dickhead)
or think to ticket you a minute after your charge stops

No, I don't think I could confess to sin
and I scratch my mind, cause the question is
when will I learn my lesson, when will I learn my lesson
I just stride for the best of things
and I scratch my mind, cause the question is
(what's the question?)
when will I learn my lesson, when will I learn my lesson

la la la la la la la {*2X*}
I ask myself, when will I learn my lesson

See, I've gotta learn that not everyone is okay that you've encountered
or try explaining to a bouncer that his name is not bouncer
when his mates all surround ya, and you've paid to come out so
why they stopped you from having fun but nowadays they'll bounce ya
the amount of times I've wound up in a crisis
well, I used to like this chick but then I found out she's a right bitch
did I miss the point, I get tripped up at every turn
the art of learning lesson's is a lesson that I never learnt
a lesson that I never learnt, a lesson that I never learnt, a lesson that I never learnt
I ask myself, when will I learn my lesson

No, I don't think I could confess to sin
and I scratch my mind, cause the question is
when will I learn my lesson, when will I learn my lesson
I just stride for the best of things
and I scratch my mind, cause the question is
(what's the question?)
when will I learn my lesson, when will I learn my lesson {*2X*}

yeah yeah</pre>
