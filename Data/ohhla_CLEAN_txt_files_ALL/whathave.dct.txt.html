Song:   What Have We Become?
Typed by: alcatrazz_iz_crazy_4_god@yahoo.com

A preacher shuns his brother
Cause his bride's a different color
And this is not acceptable
His papa taught him so
It was love that he'd been preaching
But this was overreaching
The boundaries stretchin' further
Than his heart would choose to go

Like an angel with no wings
Like a kingdom with no king

[Chorus 1]
What have we become?
A self indulgent people
What have we become?
Tell me where are the righteous ones?
What have we become?
In a world degenerating
What have we become?

[Chorus 2]
Speak your mind, look out for yourself
The answer to it all is a life of wealth
Grab all you can cause you live just once
You got the right to do whatever you want
Don't worry about others or where you came from
It ain't what you were, it's what you have become

Mom and dad are fightin'
As rosie lies there crying
For once again she's overheard
Regrets of their mistake
With christmas bells a-ringing
Little rosie'd leave them grieving the gift she'd give her family
Would be the pills she'd take

An inconvenient child
She wasn't worth their while

[Chorus 1 + 2]

What about love?
What about god?
What about holiness?
What about mercy, compassion and selflessness?

You know it's true
He is there for me and you
Doesn't matter what you do

[Chorus 1]

What have we become?
Have we come undone?
What have we become?
Have we come undone?
What have we become?

[Chorus 2]

Selfish... ???
With selfish... ???
Selfish people
When you gonna learn?
Everyone of us
Gathered 'round in trust
What have we become?</pre>
