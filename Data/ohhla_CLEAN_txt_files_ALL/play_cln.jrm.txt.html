[Notorious B.I.G.]
Uh

Chorus: Notorious B.I.G. {DJ Clark Kent}
PLAYERS! Grab your {*dick*} if you love hip hop
LADIES! Rub your {*titties*} if you love Big Poppa
Got ya, open off the words I say because
{"This type of {*shit*} happens everyday" --&gt; Slick Rick}

[Verse 1: Lil' Cease]
Now, who smoke more blunts than a little bit
What are you, a idiot
Listen to the lyrics I spit like M1's
Got mad guns up in the cabin
Cause Cease ain't the one for the dibbin' and dabbin' (Shhh...)
I make it happen, you got your ass caught
All you saw was fire, from the Honda Passport
On the M.P., what if you see, then I miss ya
I blow up spots like little sisters
G'wan, grit ya teeth
G'wan, bite ya nails to the cuticles
Like Murray, my killers, be the most beautiful
Junior M.A.F.I.A. clique thick like Luke dancers
Players, grab your gats
Honies, take a glance
At the little one, pullin' over in the Land Rover
Playin' Big Willie style with the chaffeur
You know what I mean
Stack the green, read all between the lines
A fool act up make the maggot hard to find

Repeat Chorus Twice

[Girl]
How ya livin', Biggie Smalls?

[Verse 2: Notorious B.I.G.]
I'm surrounded by criminals
Heavy rollers, even the sheisty individuals
Smokin' skunk and mad Phillies
Beating down Billy Badasses, cracks in stacks and masses
If robbery's a class, bet I pass it
Things get drastic
I'm burying ya, bastards
Big Poppa never softenin'
Take you to the church, rob the preacher for the offerin'
Leave the fool coughin' up blood, and his pockets like rabbit ears
Covered the wife, kleenex for the kid's tears
Versace wear, Moschino on my misses
She whippin' my ride, countin my one's, thinkin' I'm richest
Just the way players play
All day everyday
I don't know what else to say
I been robbin' fools since Run and them was singin'
"Here We Go," snatchin' ropes at the Roxie homeboy
You didn't know my flow, detrimental to your health
Usually roll for self, I have son ridin' shotgun
My mind's my nine, my pen's my Mac-10
My target
All you emcees who started rappin'
Junior M.A.F.I.A. steelo, people know the half
Caviar for breakfast, champagne bubble baths
Runnin' up in pretty honies constantly
The Smalls, baby, who you thought it was supposed to be

Repeat Chorus Twice

[Verse 3: Lil' Kim]
I used to pack Macs in Cadillacs
Now I pimp gats in the Ac's (Uh)
Watch my money stacks (What)
Nines in the stores, glocks in the bags
Maxin' mini-markets, gettin' money with the Arabs
No question, confession, yes it's the lyrical
Ladies, shake your hips, players, grab your genitals
Proteins and minerals, exclude subliminals
Big Momma shoots the game to all you Willies and criminals (Uh)
I kick the really with my peeps all day (Ha)
325's roll by with the windows down halfway
DKNY, oh my, I'm jiggy
It's all about the clique, Junior M.A.F.I.A. and Biggie (What)
Fellas love the way I bust a rhyme (Ha ha)
Cause they all in line, screamin' one more time
"Players, grab your {*dicks*} if you love hip hop"
Ladies rub-a-dub in the back of the club, straight up

[Lil' Kim]
Uh
Junior M.A.F.I.A.
Yeah
9-5 for that
Mmmm
Whoo
Lil' Cease
Lil' Kim, Big Poppa in the
Whoo
Yeah
Bringing it straight to ya live
You know what I'm sayin'
And it's on
And it's on</pre>
