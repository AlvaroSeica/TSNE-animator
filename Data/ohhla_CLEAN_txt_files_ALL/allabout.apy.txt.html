"One gun, two gun, three gun, four

Yours, mine, it's all about crime" - Onyx 'Throw Ya Gunz' 
"One gun, two gun, three gun, four"

[Verse One]
It's been all about (CRIME!)
Pretty much since the beginning of time
Early men killed each other for objects that shine
Now business men do it with progress in mind
It ain't all about sweeps, projects and nines
This is (CRIME!), a very complex design
As long as motherfuckers got checks to sign
As long as they connects got a Lex to shine
Find the money or these cats got tecs in mind
This is (CRIME!)
Ain't nobody new to it
Everybody been through it
Shit, even Martha Stewart do it
White collar, not a lot of time
Tell 'em what you got in mind, stock times to glock clips
There's a whole lot of crime

[Scratch Chorus]

[Verse Two]
And now they configure their secrecy in dollar signs
All the time tryin' to increase they bottom line
By any means, any schemes, any product lies
Buying bullets and then go bowling for Columbine (CRIME!)
Con men, congressmen with they concubines
Condoleezza Rice types confound in the conscious mind (CRIME!)
They frontin' with they witty facade
But more kids got guns than The City Of God
When Cube copped heat from Sweets with little cash supply
"Damn baby, tell your mother Jackie said 'Hi'."
They're easy to cop
Hard to stop
Even rappers are turnin' gangsta shit to pop

[Scratch Chorus]

[Verse Three]
There's even thugs runnin' things in the slums of London, England
Drug rings, king pins, stay smugglin' things in
Invest in a vest, chest protected with metal
A way of life from broken down to the molecular level
It's like one block, two blocks, three pounds of product
Four story building where that work gets knocked up
Powder got more power when cooked with flower
So these motherfuckers hustlin' till the 25th Hour
From the east to the west to the place you least expect
From the gangsters we respect to the snakes police protect
From the Criminal Minded like KRS-One
From the criminal minded like gangsters with guns
