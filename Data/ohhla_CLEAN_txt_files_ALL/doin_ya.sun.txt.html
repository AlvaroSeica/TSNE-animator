[Intro : Hell Razah]
Yeah, Joe Uzi, Makeba Mooncycle

[Prodigal Sunn (Hell Razah)]
You might catch me outta Cali' swervin'
(Doin' my thang)
Lames out to ruin the game
(I'm doin' my thang)
See me in the hood, Blackwood
twistin' a Range and every nigga from the ghetto
(Probably doin' the same)
Keep my metal on the side when
(I'm doin' my thang)
Focus my aim, stack CREAM
(Doin' my thang)
Six-foot-two, ladies love the way that charm swing
Out in Palm Springs, stoned off that crippy
sticky green, video shoots
Them candies in them penthouse booth
Catch me blowin' shorty out in the confession booth
Money market plans, keep a nigga stressin' for loot
I stay high, fly, dressed in them custom-made suits
Big business, live for my fruit
build for my fam, here's another one
Sunz Of Man platinum jam

[Hell Razah (Makeba Mooncycle)]

Aiyo, I saw many come and go that wanna be me
I show love to fans, this ain't TV
Hos wanna come in the bed, drink and feed me
I can't help it, it's real, I live kingly
To stand where I be at now it ain't easy
I grew up where the Bricks and fiends be
Wanna paper hate, but we gon' eat
Kill a party up in South Beach
smokin' on a pound from Greece
Do the knowledge, everyone I'm around is deep
Sunn-zi, me and Makeba givin' you heat
Yours truly, Heavenly Razah
keepin' it street, even if a nigga hate
(Keep doin' ya thang)
In the club with my bottle out
(Buildin' with queens)
You might see me at the Superbowl
(Kickin' some game)
You might see me comin' out of the store
(Just keep doin' ya thang)
Buying champagne and Pampers
(Doin' ya thang)
Up at Pakmart shopping
(Doin' ya thang)
Coppin' weed out the weed stash
(Still doin' my thang)

[Makeba Mooncycle]
I'm at the head of my helm
Reigning my realm, holdin' my weight
I'm bustin', I'm bustin' right through the gate
Mooncycle stashin' ammo and rifles
I will fight you, beat, bite you, out-write you
spark my crew to ignite you
Masquerades, I protect with rocks and grenades
This is everyday as we plot and we pray
Known as warriors, we come out to play
To bless the ignorant, we got rhymes for days
'Cos I don't wanna hurt nobody
out on the street or up in the party
I know my directives, this is S.O.M
That's an acronym for the Sunz Of Man</pre>
