[Verse 1]
Now when your young death can make you aware of your mortality
Yet times we feel invicible, lose site of reality
Until it takes a loved one residing in our circle
It'll hurt you 'cause you miss em'
once were close now you're distant
And it hurts just to know that they could go at any instant
Gotta love them by the minute, now you realise this
It's sad it takes a loss to appreciate the gifts
so celebrate the occasion, just breathing is amazing
To see the sun rise and set at a day's end
A chance to fix mistakes that we regret making
Find joy in the simple things, no time for complaining
The sun will shine, it cant always be raining
I know it hurts deep, but you must maintain it
I seen it in my homeboys Terry and Tom
They lost so many, yet they keep so strong
To lose a parent or a sibling and have the will to keep living
Takes so much strength, so I admire y'all
and one day hope to find out what inspires y'all
Cause I'm still mad askin why it happens at all
Some say that God takes them and they lean on mythology
But I choose to believe that its divine lottery
I cant believe Gods lookin down waitin to slaughter me
I cant live in fear and I cant live here 
forever, so I treasure every moment

[Chorus] {X2}
And its friendship that I value the most
That kinship, the ones we hold close
and deal with it the most of losin but keep truing
The memories bluing 'cause life keeps moving

[Verse 2]
We came together like family, like it was our first death
Unexpected, so quick, so sudden, the worst yet
Didnt get to know the girl 'til years after her first breath 
still we loved her like a sister, as if there for first steps
Got the call out of town, so alone I first wept
Deep pain in the same place from where this verse crept
Never slept in that bed again, the memory was too tragic 
Looked up and screamed goodbye
No you wouldn't be present at the wake in your casket
Now you ask if things change since you left, not really
We still playin games, BS n' actin silly
See she dont talk to her and she dont like me
And will we work things out, thats not likely
I mean where will we start, do we mend friendships?
Or let things fall apart, will we still be in touch
Honestly I don't know, but you're in my heart forever

[Chorus] {X3}

Go have a little blue and blow a blunt while you cruisin
Love your friends that you choosin'
Gotta love before you lose it
Stand strong when you do it, tough times live through it
Don't give into em, stay go pursuin, and doin what you doin 
Cause life keeps movin on</pre>
