[Chorus]
Unbreakable
You can't break our bond It's far too strong
Unshakeable
Ooooh... we love we cry we ride we die
Unmistakable
There's so questioning It's the real thing
It's unbreakable
You can't try but I'm telling you It's unbreakable

Never endured a love like this
It's just pure tenderness
From the morning to the midnight
The million ways he's loving me
Never have I known It's so true, ooooh
These heights he takes me to
I've lost control he caressed my soul oh
I aint never gonna leave

You can't, you can't, you can't, you can't
You can't have it, no, no, no, nooo...
You can't, you can't, you can't, you can't
You can't get it, oooohh woo...
You can't, you can't, you can't, you can't
You can't take it, no, no, noooo...
You can't, you can't, you can't, you can't
You can't break it, no, nooo...

[Chorus]
Unbreakable
You can't break our bond It's far too strong
Unshakeable
Ooooh... we love we cry we ride we die
Unmistakable
There's so questioning It's the real thing
It's unbreakable
You can't try but I'm telling you It's unbreakable

All I seem to feel is complete
It's so real It's so deep
I'm surround and I'm drowning
Just can't catch my breath
And it seems I have everything
You can't replace the joy that he brings
He's my heartbeat and my soul-mate
Gonna be by his side til' my death

You can't, you can't, you can't, you can't
You can't have it, no, no, no, nooo...
You can't, you can't, you can't, you can't
You can't get it, oooohh woo...
You can't, you can't, you can't, you can't
You can't take it, no, no, noooo...
You can't, you can't, you can't, you can't
You can't break it, no, nooo...

[Chorus]
Unbreakable
You can't break our bond It's far too strong
Unshakeable
Ooooh... we love we cry we ride we die
Unmistakable
There's so questioning It's the real thing
It's unbreakable
You can't try but I'm telling you It's unbreakable

[Chorus]
Unbreakable
You can't break our bond It's far too strong
Unshakeable
Ooooh... we love we cry we ride we die
Unmistakable
There's so questioning It's the real thing
It's unbreakable
You can't try but I'm telling you It's unbreakable</pre>
