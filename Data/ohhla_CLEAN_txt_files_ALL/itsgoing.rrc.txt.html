Yeah Whooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Yeah, Yeah

(Chorus) 2x
I've been waiting, Spend my time chasing
For your Love, But it's goin down tonight
It's goin down tonight

Verse 1:
What did you think you would do?
What did you think you would say?
After I told you how I was feeling
Never thought I'd see this day
I always kept dreaming
Never I felt you hurt my heart
I knew that you would soon see better
All I can do is hope and Say

(Hook)
Is there a chance or a possibility
That I can get close to you
I want to get Romantic with you
Do all the things that lovers do
Finally all the things that I've done to get
The chance to be with you
It was sure nuf' worth the wait
Tonight I'll be wrapped up in your arms

(Chorus) 2x

Verse 2:
I always kept Wishing
I always kept Praying
Good things come to those who wait
That's what Mama always said
Baby dat Phrase stuck in my head
There's nothing I won't do, To Please you
Even the chance, Ill do you right
Deep down inside I have to knowwwwww

(Hook)

(Chorus) 4x

Oh

Hey, Hey, Heyyyyyyyyyyyy 

(Chorus) 4x</pre>
