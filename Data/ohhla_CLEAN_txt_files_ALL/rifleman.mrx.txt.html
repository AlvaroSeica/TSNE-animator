Verse 1:

Every night I pray with my rifle, pray for my rival
Pray for armageddon, the day of survival
Came to harm the bredrin, thats claiming the title
Trained to arm the weapon and aim at your idol
Flame will spark the second betrayed by disciple
Bang your armor shredding your brains and your vital
Dames recall the reverend page from the bible
Change your form and essence, spray em in a cycle
Lames remain spiteful styles
Rugged bars that slay
Spies hunted from 5 hundred yards away
I'm digital camo' you lingerie
E am modern day, Vietnam conflict Pearl Harbor bay
Fuck the frauds will say, make it all clear
Check the armory the arsenal is all near
I really fired at a target through a crosshair
And its nothing like playing modern warfare

Hook X2:

Believe they are not in my league
It's time that I lead, you liable to bleed
Strive to achieve
I'ma proceed to enlighten the seed
And I'ma write it indeed
I'ma recite it like the rifleman's creed 

Verse 2:

Targets hit while you acting grim and talking shit
Disregard him quick
Let off a clip practicing my marksmanship
I cant part with it, i must master it
Protect from rust and damages bust accurate
Plus attack with it, imma spray correct
Adjust attach a tip slay him wit the bayonet
Take a moment for disabled vets
Trouble awaits which one of these double agent traitors next
Plot to take my breath, wipe the handle
Wipe the sights and barrel infrared light apparel
Decide on ammo, from marxman to sharpshooter,
To expert, spark the ruger bronx to fallujah
Born ruler, the type that will fight for reign
Surgically strike the game, the sniper came
Deny the pain, but your life vitals cycle strained
Precise with aim, the mic is my rifle range

Hook X2

verse 3:

The bullets crash like an iron steed, wrath let the lions feed
An outcast, the last of a dying breed
Rounds blast, and travel death defying speed
You clowns ass, in battle get your alliance sieged
Your minor league, cant even stand next to me
Master the enemy  by planning exact trajectory
Handling weaponry become an unstoppable force
Apply your thoughts, life is an obstacle course
Gain my wisdom from a proper source
Mission carried with precision i aint missing when im popping off
Your block is soft, flashbacks tear my soul apart
Forward march though the road is dark cold and harsh
You know its marx im drilling shields iron armor
My mind is darker, the killing fields divide and conquer
The fire starter, your skin is peeled crying horror
It's sayonara, at least you can die with honor</pre>
