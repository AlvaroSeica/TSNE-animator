[Verse 1: Young Noble]

Against all odds us against the world!
You only live once, the freedom is a rush
Is like the future close, thats why im speedin up
Focus on the prize turn my dreams to reality
This shit these niggas dream about, is really my reality!
I like my whip topless, and my bitch topless
We ain't worried bout the cops or whoever watching

All green everything we gon make it flip right now

[Verse 2: Shawnna]
Huh, um look.
I like my whips flawless
My crib is gorgeous
The size of my whole bankroll is enormous!
Out city's for it,your chicks boring
While she sit and waiting home im on trips tourin!
Ballenciada, Alexander Mcqueen
Every room in my house got a money machine
Picture me flying G-6 in them white sins
See im his main bitch, he my right hand
And we dont give a dammn, we got a money team
We blow it all like is growing on a money tree!
See he is in love with me, and im in love with him
So if you fuck with me, you gota fuck with them
So if you make a wrong move then its lights out
We put them big boys up and pull them bikes out!
We blow them pipes out
We livin it rich
Bumping that old school biggie "me and my bitch"

[Chorus: Young Noble]
I like my whip topless and my bitch topless
Can you vision how a nigga ride?
I like my whip topless and my bitch topless
She feel free, anytime she ride beside me
I like my whip topless and my bitch topless
This outlaw lifestyle we livin is priceless!
I like my whip topless and my bitch topless
She said its freedom, every single time we ridin


[Verse 3: Gage Gully]
Follow our own rules, we outlawz we the munity
I like my whip topless, no tellin where the roof will be
I like my bitch topless, she get a rush outa nudity
She hang on every word think i speak hope fluently
I tell the truth, schooling and youth to help the communitys
We young eneptrenours, creating opportunity
Dont obey by the laws we, got underwold unity
She in love with the future thats where im headin so move with me
All green evrything we scheme for steady cream
I seen this whole thing clear out before i sleep in my dreams
Thats why im ready,heavy foot on the gas i got this
She ridin aroun topless, im drivin around topless
The feeling of freedom ill
Cuz i know what the cost is so i enjoy it everyday and eat how a boss live
She look at me, her eyes speak without sayin a word
Fantasy became reality so fast we free as a bird
Find how!

[Chorus: Young Noble]
I like my whip topless and my bitch topless
Can you vision how a nigga ride?
I like my whip topless and my bitch topless
She feel free, anytime she ride beside me
I like my whip topless and my bitch topless
This outlaw lifestyle we livin is priceless!
I like my whip topless and my bitch topless
She said its freedom, every single time we ridin</pre>
