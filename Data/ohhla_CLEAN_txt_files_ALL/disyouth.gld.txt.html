[Santigold]
Don't look ahead there's stormy weather
Another road block in our way
But if we go, we go together
Our hands are tied here if we stay

[Chorus 1]
Oh we set our dreams, to carry us
And if they don't fly we will run
Now we push right past to find out
On how to win what they have lost

[Chorus 2: repeat 2X]
Oh ah, oh ah
We know now we won't go
Oh ah, oh ah
Our lives' worth fighting for

[Santigold]
So let them say we can't do better
Lay out the rules that we can't break
They wanna sit and watch you wither
Their legacy's too hard to take

[Chorus 1] + [Chorus 2]

[Santigold]
In their heads, head in their beds
In their eyes it shows
When the beacon breaks for them
You ask and they don't know
Oh tell me then
I turn my back while the odds all stand beneath me
And they all said, I was misled
But now the odds all stand beneath me

[Chorus 2] - 1/2

[Chorus 1] + [Chorus 2]

[Outro: repeat 2X]
You were wrong, let me hear what you say
Now here we come, can't stop nothing in our way</pre>
