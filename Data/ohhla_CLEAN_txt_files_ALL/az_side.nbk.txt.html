[Radio]
Yo its ???? WNBK the only radio station that slams a jam 
check this out ladies from Nasty Boy Klick its the AZ Side

[Chorus] x1
Take a little trip,Take a little trip with me
Take a little trip,Take a little trip and see
------ Now who wants to take a trip(echoe)
Sit back enjoy the ride,As we take a little trip
Through the AZ Side

[Verse 1] 
Now let me step out the Arizona sunset
Album number 2 just to clock respect(uhh)
This time we gotta do it my way
Cruise control with me and ziggy hit the highway
Bout to hit the spot so pop the top
To the bottle of the champagne
In the studio workin on a phat track
New release cause I'm lookin for the fat stacks
Uhh change the flow for my hente
Dropin all those lyrics that are stickin to your mente
So let it be known that I'm the rap mistro
Bouncin like a ride with the hydros
Too swift in the mix in the backround
Makin sure the honeys on flow get down
So get live and do what you do
Cause we gotsta bomb from the 6 cero 2

[Chorus]x1

[Verse 2]
Steppin out the doorway holmes,its the zig zag
My khakis all bagged,saturday night and its time to party
We have a hotel suite for the after party
We'll have sex on the beach
Cisco ????? while the rest is sprung off that coke and bacardi
And those rainbow daceries
Fillin dirty mouth of fantasies
We got warm summer knocks for the freaks
And all the dogs chasing all the kitties
From all over the cities,came to the zone to party
Zig zag with the magic ?????
So you can ride from the westside,eastside,northside and the south
We gets down so california gon feel it
So how ya gonna dis it if ya never even seen it

[Chorus]x1

[Verse 3]
We'll hit the switch and let the back fall
Its 10 o'clock and its time to hit central
Cause all the hoochies lined up straight beggin for the ride
Rollin in the passport leanin to the side
Well let it ride I was all high
To keep my mind off the heat
With the AC blowin in my face as we hit center street
Cause you know how we do it
Laaaa five carloads,caravan,and one line
Turning right cause I'm bout to hit baseline
Bump the alpine its MC Magic and too swift
And you know the ziggy's still up on it
I got the calls hoppin,girly stoppin
Remember how I used to be when punks never had to quit this bumpin
So drop the gats and check the track
And take a ride through the AZ Side

[Chorus]x2
