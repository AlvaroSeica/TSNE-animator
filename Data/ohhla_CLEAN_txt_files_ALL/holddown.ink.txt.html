Song:   Hold It Down
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus - Kevin Cossom]
I know that times are hard and you might need a break
Hope you can hold it down till I'm on my way
Girl I'll give you the world but until the day
Hope you can hold it down until I'm on my way
Girl I'm tryna get to you as fast as I can but until
I get there, can you hold it down girl, hold it down, hold it down, hold it
(Till I'm on my way) hold it down girl

[Verse 1 - Kid Ink]
I'm out here, tryna get paper, map-sized, hold me down like I'm getting baptized
I can see it in your mad eyes, now I'm looking like a bad guy(guy)
A little change in my pocket don't change my heart, you should slow down
Hit a break and park
Cuz you lookin at me in the wrong way
Don't waste time and throw it all away
So soon, pent-house rooms, high heeled shoes, girl its not an excuse
But I got shit to do like a plumma(plumber)
See you when the sun up, this summa(summer)

[Chorus]

[Verse 2 - Jon Connor]
I am on my way
Heads strong
I hold my weight
With the flow, I hold my own
And on my back I hold my state
Can't help but eat these rappers cuz they shit-list on my plate
Killing shit
They can't see me till I see the pearly gates
Look, Haters used the ammo that gon turn me into Rambo
Turn the beat on and the heat on
Watch me murder shit at random
Man First the haters doubt me based on the shit they know about me
I'm the one
Now they feel me in they stomach like an outie
I ain't never made excuses
I just went and made a movement
The flow gotta be crazy
Being broke mean you losin
Nowadays niggas ain't real
I stay away from illusions
Now I'm in the position to make a million making music
And I will because I'm ill
And there ain't no cure for poppin pills
And I got drive, you ain't not no wheels
Holla at girls if you got my skills
Look, all these niggas pissed
They could feel it in their bladder
But I've learned that my opinion is the only one that matters

[Chorus]</pre>
