[Intro: Crunch Lo]
Got to have that shhhh
And I love that shhhhh
And I love that shhhhh
I got to have that shhhh
Cuz I smoke that...

[Chorus: Crunch Lo (Lounge Lo) {both}]
Come here, cuz you shine, give me a little time
(You catch my eye, like a dime walking by)
Come here, cuz you shine, like fine wine and good taste
(Caught my eye, like a dime, walking by)
By the way (by thee) physically, a perfect ten (immaculate)
The fly shit {something I gots to get with}

[Crunch Lo]
Introduced to a chick, at the age of fourteen
Peace my name is Crunch, you can call me Beneen
I like the way she smell, loved the sense of kid
Couldn't wait to bomb with you, like my father did
Back in the day, anyway, I'm a sucker for you
Spend my last fox head to get in touch with you
A month late, up early, red eyes and looking worried
Cuz I hung out with you, ain't nothing I could do
To stop, now I cop you, and run when you say so
Dig in my stash, and deduct from my pay roll
And when she start barking, I can't yell back
Cuz I, keep on coughing, spit lungies often
And I got the munchies like I'm one, see it
What the hell is going, I'm strung on Miss Strong
She fuck with other niggas and run with steady bitches
I still bring her home, and still treat my figures
I go great distance, when I hit, she look good
You might see me with a screwface, in ya hood
Looking for my lady, my sweet lady
Put her to my lips and stop me from going crazy
Let your love shine, for the short mean time
That I got you in the role, in the two-finger hole
Decked with the gold, now everything's peace
Took her to my crib, wrapped her up in my sheets
I hit it while I drink, she making me thank
Now she all in my bank, and I moms think she stank
But she get me higher, than a mountain peak
Aiyo, I'm talking bout this weed, I'm talking bout this dime piece

[Hook: Crunch Lo]
Yeah, cuz I need that shhhh
And I love that shhhh
I got to have that shhhh
And I love that shhhh

[Chorus]

[Lounge Lo]
I had a glass of black berry, O.F. and the Deck
Lady Green legs pinned behind her neck
Played her wet spot, until I had smoke in my lungs
I was eating her son, I had buds on my tongue
It was a loose one, next time, tighten ya twist
Where the Gods are great, you dealing with a slang therapist
She laughed, rewrapped her ass in spandex
Mad tight, and shook it in my face all night
When I attempt to hit that, she went back in the jar
Caught a battery, came back and blew the shit out of me
The red head was hot, so I creep with a tactic
Threw my hands around the body, and stroked her with a back hit
She bust, smoke came all out her Dutch
Nah plus, had me laid back from the lust
She nicknamed me, called me, vanilla fudge
Called her caramel mint, light skin with a tint
A green in her eyes, tattoo on her thigh
It said smoke, smoke til the day that I die
Voluptious, equality built, and stayed in touch with this
Dime sack of life, soon to be the wiz
Ay, what's up China girl... yeah, son...

[Chorus]
