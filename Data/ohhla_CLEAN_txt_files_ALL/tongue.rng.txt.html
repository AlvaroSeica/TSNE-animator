You here the Strings nigga

On this side of this thong shit

[DJ Clue]
The tongue song 
Strings
Hold Up

[Strings]
This might sound so scandalous
But is true that men can't handle it 
See most of the time a nigga dick ain't shit
Need to go a step further and lick the clit (uhh)
Keep lickin till you hit my spot
Nigga fuck all the ju in the bugie pa
She gets no skin just comin from cock
Put your face all in my chocha
cuz I'm gon get a nut nut nut (man)
Head like what, what, what,
Hands up in my butt, butt, butt
You need to lick it again 
cuz I'm gon get a nut nut nut (man)
Head like what, what, what,
All night long
Work the tongue (come on tongue come on)

[Chorus]
I like it when the niggaz go dun-nuh duh
The way you make my pussy go duh-nuh-duh
I know you wanna  hit so duh-nuh-duh
Give me that Tongue, Tongue, Tongue, Tongue,
I like it when the niggaz go dun-nuh duh
The way you make my pussy go duh-nuh-duh
I know you wanna  hit so duh-nuh-duh
Give me that Tongue, Tongue, Tongue, Tongue,

My niggaz keep tongue out thong and shit
I wanna see ya face in between my hips
You seen the black code

She can't scandal this you can't handle this
I like to dance till six ain't pumps
Put a philly in my pussy while you smoke a blunt
Straight put you in a ranch
Yo I ain't no punk
Have you screemin about my chocha
All nigga wanna do is fuck, fuck, fuck 
Head like what, what, what
Come and give me na, na, na
You need to sing it again 
Cause all they wanna do is fuck, fuck, fuck
Head like what, what, what
Come and give me na, na, na
I think I'll sing it again (Come on)

Come on what
Come on what
Come on what

[Chorus] 2x</pre>
