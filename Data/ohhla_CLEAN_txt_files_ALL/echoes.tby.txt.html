we are the children of the wounded 
who try to do their best 
through the eyes of a child 
echoes running through their heads 

(hook) 
echoes, echoes, echoes 
running through my mind 
just let go, let go, let go 
nowhere to hide 
echoes, echoes, echoes 
running through my mind 
just let go, let go, let go 
nowhere to hide 

used to look into my father's eyes 
saw the struggle, but he never stopped to cry 
when in poverty there's not the time 
you gotta bottle it and hope the product is not too violent 
has me wondering how does one recover when 
they see their mother burn alive right there in front of them? 
only fifteen, oldest of his siblings 
forced to raise them while holding to his big dreams 
and underneath the surface 
that pain was waiting to come up in a burst 
and sometimes, my brother got it first 
and he'd pass it along to me to cover up the hurt 
one day, when it all overloaded 
I had it up to here but didn't know how to show it 
so before I might get afraid 
I closed my eyes tight and punched him right in the face 
jumped back uncontrollably shaken 
awaiting the return but he showed me restraint 
in that space we owned our mistakes 
and I felt in that moment we'd broken a chain 
learned to respect the work ethic 
he said the words never accept the first edit 
expect the worst but don't let the nerves get it 
I try to forget the hurt but the echoes return yelling 

(hook) 
echoes, echoes, echoes 
running through my mind 
just let go, let go, let go 
nowhere to hide 
echoes, echoes, echoes 
running through my mind 
just let go, let go, let go 
nowhere to hide 

(bridge) 
feel it coming back again 
feel it coming back again 
feel it coming back again 
feel it coming back again 
feel it coming back again 
feel it coming back again 
feel it coming back again 
feel it coming back again 

look mom, 
if I had a penny every time your lies passed as truth 
I'd save up till I could buy back my youth 
went for days with a bowl of dried vomit 
poured urine on me, forced me to sit in ice water 
I'd fight harder and cry but why bother 
the bi-product I thought I'd always need my guard up 
there was love in every little punishment 
but ignoring your past, you ended up becoming it 
repressed memories are like a disease 
that show no symptoms till you die in your sleep 
exposing everyone that might be in reach 
so it comes no surprise to me 
you don't remember or choose to admit abuse that you did 
when you don't remember a thing from when you were a kid 
it lingers and the truth of it is 
if you don't confront it your children are due to relive it 
falling in the trap of blaming you for my mistakes 
acknowledging the cracks, making use of the shapes 
you will never be an excuse, forever be my purpose 
the strength in my voice, the direction to the urgency 
and every word I speak is a testament to your lessons that nurtured me 
the learning and encouragement that nurtured my dreams 
but every now and then the echoes return as screams 

(hook) 
echoes, echoes, echoes 
running through my mind 
just let go, let go, let go 
nowhere to hide 
echoes, echoes, echoes 
running through my mind 
just let go, let go, let go 
nowhere to hide

feel it coming back again 
feel it coming back again 
feel it coming back again 
feel it coming back again 
feel it coming back again 
feel it coming back again 
feel it coming back again 
feel it coming back again</pre>
