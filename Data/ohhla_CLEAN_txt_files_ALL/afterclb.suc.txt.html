(*talking*)
Yeah, S.U.C. is in the building uh-huh
Talking all that shit nigga, what it do

[H.A.W.K.]
You could meet us in the parking lot, ain't nothing else to talk about
Bout to see what H.A.W.K. about, I'ma teach your ass bout showing out
I'ma beat ya till your ass pout, call your homeboys out
Put the pistol to your mouth, and dare your ass to even cough
Yeah I'm from the dirty South, H-Town Texas
Put one in solo plexes, and then take your necklace
I'm untamed and reckless, so please do not test this
I'll shoot up your Lexus, so please do not mess with
Me Z-Ro or Mike D, or you will have to fight me
And that shit excite me, cause I swing these hands nicely
I'm asking you politely, and I ain't gon' tell you twice G
I'ma pull out my knife G, and commits to sight see
So don't take us lightly, when you see us in the club
Keep it real and showing love, or the parking lot'll be filled with blood
Giving slugs doing drugs, niggaz lying in pools of blood
Niggaz fingers cut to nubs, for fucking with these Texas thugs

[Trae]
Ain't too much finna to be said, I promise you mayn
Left and right hooks, the hands might come at ya mayn
Asshole By Nature bitch, so remember the name
Unless you wanna get a hot one, inside of your frame
You might wanna get back dog, you out of your lane
Cause if y'all in my arena, bitch I'm out of ya mayn
A clip full of hollow tips, right on front of ya mayn
And plus my kin folk Ro, right on side of me mayn
Ready for drama, we ready to scrap
Hop out the drop, 4-5 in my lap
Sizing me up, we gon' see who gets slapped
Got me fucked up, now bitch where it's at
Screwed Up Click nigga, we in the parking lot
For an' one of y'all, who like to bark a lot
Got a fully round clip, that likes to spark a lot
We run this shit, fuck what you thought about
Half of these niggaz, don't wanna see Trae
I'm well respected, from the West to the Tre
Plus I'm backed up, with two AK's
And the H-G-C's, with Trae blue and grey
And I got a few Blood's, in the red and the black
In a slab packed, with a few black macks
Making these bitch made niggaz, back back
H-Town hoe, niggaz know where it's at

[Chorus]
You can meet us in the parking lot, after the club
Don't get scurred now nigga, you done just fucked up
You can meet us in the parking lot, after the club
We can address that issue, just bring your pistol wit cha
You can meet us in the parking lot, after the club
You was talking shit at first, nigga what you scared of
You can meet us in the parking lot, after the club
Buck shot slugs nigga, buck shot slugs

[Mike D]
When they finally come get me, bury me teflon down
Fifty boxes pouring pint of drank, a half a pound
Cause I know my soul, being cast to hell
Cross your legs put your feet up, got a story to tell
Look how he booting me hard, mean mugging me hard
Make that flashback, think I'm back on the yard
Knife chained by my neck, pistol in my holster
Snuck him in this bitch, even though I ain't suppose to
Put the mash on boys, like you and your weak crew
Intimidate boys, when we do what we do
Lock it up loc it up, roll it up smoke it up
Three puff pass rule, nigga we smoke that fine dope
This time I mean it nigga, I plan to stay free
I gotta feed my family, rap gotta pay me
And if it don't, then I'm off to them Tre streets
Down 10, rumbling them flatland streets

[Z-Ro]
In the parking lot, we ain't gotta trip now
You don't want a nigga, to bust your lip now
So go on catch your breath, and sit down
But when you come outside, be ready to get down
Ain't no bitch nigga, gon' disrespect me
Get killed, you don't wanna try to check me
Left and right jabs, quicker than a jet ski
Wetting me a nigga, so a nigga don't wet me
Look me upside my head, I ain't tripping
Long as you ain't fucking with my bread, I ain't tripping
But get outta line, and go to looking me up and down
The blood start dripping, the blood start dripping
AK slugs, zip across taper fades
Repping S.U.C., we don't play no games
So meet me in the parking lot, simple and plain
Don't be reaching, cause I will put a double in your brain
I'll slide me a nigga
And if I gotta hide me a nigga, I'ma hide a bitch
Treat a nigga so wrong, I'ma feel disrespected
Then I'ma tie him up, and I'ma ride the bitch
Now post show, now you don't really wanna see all that
You don't really need to be all that
Cause if you and your people, respect my mind and fall back
Fuck around and fall flat
On your face, make a move and it's on today
Fuck going outside, I'm going for my gun
What you gon' do nigga, fight or run
If you can't back up your words, watch your tongue
Cause I'll be the one, that'll put his hands on ya
Inside or outside the club
You fucking with a sharp shooter, bitch I should pick you off
And leave you dead, right outside the club

[Chorus]</pre>
