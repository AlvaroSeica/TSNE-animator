(Mr. Shadow in background)
[Mr. Shadow] Haters, haters
             What you talkin' 'bout
[Fingazz]    Talkin' 'bout those haters in the street
[Mr. Shadow] From Dego
             To I.E.
[Fingazz]    Yeah, why do you want to hate on me?
             Shoo, doo-ooop
[Mr. Shadow] Shadow and Fingazz
[Fingazz]    Just talkin' 'bout those haters in the street (Fuck you haters)
[Mr. Shadow] Check it out
             All you motherfuckers
[Fingazz]    So that's why you want to hate on me (Haters)

[Mr. Shadow {Mr. Shadow &amp; Fingazz}]
(Verse 1)
I stay loaded to the streets
I got half the world
Mad at me
Hatin' with my name in their mouth piece
Fuck peace, bitch, here comes the pitbull
With a shaved and tatoos, comin' to get you
The other day
I heard a tweaker say
That they're watching the empire, night and day
Talkin' about I got the whole state served
{Up and down Interstate 5, flippin' birds}
The word keeps travellin'
I stay shippin' and handlin'
I gotta make my shit start scatterin'
It doesn't matter when
Placed your order
I don't care if you want it in Minnesota
I cross states with full crates and do whatever it takes
To make big and fill cases with big faces
And just in case you
Hoes didn't know (What)
Every car are (???)
Hate me more, biotch

Chorus:
[Mr. Shadow] Haters
             Dawg, what you talkin' 'bout?
[Fingazz]    I'm talkin' 'bout those haters in the street
[Mr. Shadow] Haters
             Hatin' everything I got
             Tell 'em
[Fingazz]    Yo, why do you want to hate on me?
[Mr. Shadow] Haters
[Fingazz]    Shoo, doo-ooop
[Mr. Shadow] Dawg, what you talkin' 'bout?
[Fingazz]    Just talkin' 'bout those haters in the street
[Mr. Shadow] Haters
             Just mad cause I'm blowin' up their spot
[Fingazz]    So that's why you want to hate on me

(Verse 2)
I take a hit and I laugh at these petty-ass wannabes
You break bread when we take over your colonies
The streets are calling me, there's ends to collect
Eye in the sky, steel derit hasn't left
You're runnin' out of breathe
Sellin' all them woof tickets
{They can't see a millionaire from the hood, kick it}
So keep your mouth shut
You jealous bastards
And when the pig ask somethin', you don't answer
What you hear
In the circle
Stays in the circle
Run your beak and get beat
Til your turn purple
I think it's best that you run back home
I'm sick in the dome
You're answerin', "The murder is on"
From night til dawn
Whether it's
Right or wrong
I gotta
Stay paid
All day long
Remain calm
Cause only the strong get to see another day
So watch what who you hatin' on

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 3)
[Mr. Shadow] Now there's one more I gotta bring to the table
             For them punk ass deputies, you bitches need security
             Outgun
             Outnumbered
             Outdone
             The result is a fucked up outcome
             Number one, can't nobody take out from me
             I got it locked from my hood to your county
             Rowdy people
             I don't know
             Why the fuck they say that all men are created equal
             It's plain and simple, gotta make what you spend
             And if it don't make dollars, better pay me a cent
             I represent
             All my soldiers that are playing to win
             And all the motherfuckin' riders makin' moves in the pen
             See; talk is cheap, it don't make me or break me
             Heat off safety, for you cops tryin' to take me
             Hate me if you want, but I'm a grind til my last day
[Fingazz]    So what more can I say about you haters

Repeat Chorus

[Mr. Shadow]
Ah ha
Yeah
This song's dedicated to everyone of you fools that playa hated
Mr. Shadow (Shadow)
Fingazz
My homeboy Krook, you know
Streetlight, Pit Boss (Ha ha)
One love
2001, bitch (2K1)
Pack a lunch and an extra pair of nuts (Extra nuts)
Find me in San Diego, puffin' on a blunt {*inhale*} (Blunts, biotch)</pre>
