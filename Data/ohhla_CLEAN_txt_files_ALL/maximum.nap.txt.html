[Crook Nitty]
I remember my mom said crime, gon' get my ass killed, they at a fed time
I did five, three of the livest prisons, I did mine
With ease, blew trees, with killas and thieves, I wreck yards
Stay fighting and lighting, new borns, niggas respect our
Rep where I'm from, no smiles, nigga, bad news
Hit the weight pile, come out my shirt, show my tattooes
Mad crews of so called thugs was hoes, dirt solved
Spit game, bitch CEO's, watching me jerkoff
Made pocket pussy, creese around gloves, creese sheets
Blaze free books, use lotion and Royal Crown grease
Clowns beef, seen dome split by sock lock
CO bitches wanting to fuck, but niggas cock block
But cats was still booking them bitches, got us some head too
Got drug and them hoes did what them niggas said so
I bet it ran stoveboxes, fronted niggas with credit
Ran up in cell, took commissary and cosmetics
And stated a hoe, locked in a cell, 24 hours
Two times a week, handcuffed, going in showers
In the wreck cage, doing pushups, while the cassette played
Heard war stories from cats that been down for decades
Ran my bid up, wilding out, time, got tricked up
Faggots with tits, caught my man getting his dick sucked
Time'll change any nigga mind frame, this a mind game
The thought of never coming home'll give you a migraine
I know niggas with life and some change, and conversations here about
Niggas with ass, and nice with the brain
Who got hit, with the what, CO watch dick
I bugged out, freaking my black, while niggas talk shit
Sneaker robbers, plotting on Chucks, ordered from Eastbay
Each day, wait in the cell, the same cliche
Talking poker, mad chain smokers, caughts on Sorzene
Life at 14, noddin' out, like they on morphine
Feel the tension, when it get real, they steal snitching
Cats still in the deal and then selling shit out the kitchen
Hercules is benching, hard rocks turning religion
Behind bars in prison, with Muslim Gods in prisons
And I been a vet, ran with cold con artist with intellect
Cats that been down so long, they ain't heard of the internet
Lives on hold, locked in VA, ain't on parole
It's 85 percent of your time, under control
Had coups of chicks, now it stay boots for kicks
Spending dough on commisary, living off suits and chips
Stack up, distorted white boys and burn the jacker
Fiend for that day, when they came and told me to pack up
Was gone so long, as on, your being warned
For this, only perform in wreckyards and prison dorms
And these rap niggas, talking crazy shit in they rhymes
Like they really did some real time, nigga, you did a baby bid
We the trife type, til my niggas hit up in night fights
Big Crook professional bidder, that's what my life like

[Interlude: Napoleon]
Yeah, nigga, that's that real shit right there, yo
VA penitenteries, kid, all ya'll niggas on that street
That think ya'll doing ya'll thing
Knowhatimean, if you ain't prepared to do the muthafucking time
Don't do the god damn rhyme, yo

[Napoleon]
I got niggas locked at success, same prize, power tan in Greensville
They go there business, swallow balloons and shit fiend pills
Red onion murderers trout, twenty three hours
Sixty minutes left to play chess, TV or shower
Loansville Correctional chicks, trick for cash money
Crash dummies, every new year, we drank mad, sunny
Came out in modern day slaves, got to masturbate
Fake Christians sleeping with fags, inside of master's gate
Eighty five percent of your time, it's no parole, kid
Get 50, do 45, damn, your whole bid
James River redneck waters, dirty, you heard me?
Either milk cows or lose your 30 for 30
During lock down, turn off his swolls, became a ritual
Five hundred push-ups a day, the pain is physical
Old heads, cheating padroll with toilet paper dice
Richmond niggas breaking in lockers, same paper twice
Had my man sitting on 20 cartons of Malboro
Tidewater niggas the illest, yeah, we all thorough
South Hampton and Cobsville Sunny, at a tabernacle
Faggots running round with hickies on they Adam's apple
Necklenberg, damn, the Bradley Brothers escaped
Even though rusty barbwires covered the gate
I'mma convict, half of you muthafuckas is inmates
Stay struck, moving like zombies, after 10 straight
My Timb's laced, inside of my mattress, I got the icepick
Razorblade, under my tongue, ready to slice shit
The gun game, got 'em insane, it's like a new sport
Newports is just like money, if you do snort
It's more dope in prison than it is in a crack house
That's why niggas happens the same when they back out

[Chorus: Quan]
All my life I've been beated
From juvenile to state prison
Oooh, shit, CO's, trying to keep me from home
Fucking with my good time, ah, I'm in the hole
But I did my crime, so I'll do my time
And I, never snitch, cuz I ain't no bitch
I'm a muthafucking soldier
I'm a muthafucking soldier, nigga</pre>
