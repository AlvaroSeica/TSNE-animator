[Lil' 1/2 Dead chorus 2x]
it's the 12 pacofdoja
I told cha befo' cha
here's a litte G throwin boulders from the shoulders

[Quick Ta Mac verse (Lil' 1/2 Dead)]
you thought I was gone
well I'm right back on yo ass
I'm the lower class so I must have yo cash
hoes call me Sam recognize who I am
that nigga who can slam maybe jam, goddamn
who am I (the smoothest, I groove this, no cluedish)
I write you down the stack
you right back up if you act up, don't clown
back up now, cuz Quick the M-A double C and HD
Stank is a fool as I swoop and recoup the heat, freeze
peef to this nuts
but don't touch the negros got you totally fucked up
16 bars on this ? ass tracks
they got you freaked shuck up broke
so inhale this indo smoke
who found yo speakers, you finally peeped us
negros can't see us
(matter of fact I think they need us)
need us, if you won't play the script of a knucklehead
put the bed, rock quicker
Mack, Chaos and Half Dead

[Lil' 1/2 Dead chorus 4x]
it's the 12 pacofdoja
I told cha befo' cha
here's a little G throwin boulders from the shoulders

[Chaos verse (Lil' 1/2 Dead)]
I'm MC C-O indeed on this 12 pacofdoja
Chaos is in the dove in '94 like I told cha
nothin but the funk for your trunk so make way
what's really goin on on the east on friday
it's my day like Z-Z
they only one that can see the
but I'd rather do your crew on sunday morning cuz it's easy
this B.G. is not to be temperate with like toxic
you learn quick to mack
bring it back now watch me drop it
(like shit from my burn cuz my word is tight
like a vergin steady spurgin cuz you heard it right)
don't bite, don't even try to take my flow and expand it
cuz this a Chaos thing and you wouldn't understand it (fool)
for grandid, this how we take foes (foes), indo scoes (scoes)
this how it goes (goes)
and will it stop, noone knows (knows)
doja pro's be throwin bolo's, commitin no-no's
I step on your toes
I'm down with Half that's how it goes

[Lil' 1/2 Dead chorus 4x]
it's the 12 pacofdoja
I told cha befo' cha
here's a little G throwin boulders from the shoulders

[Lil' 1/2 Dead verse]
it's the 12 pacofdoja
I told cha befo' cha
cuz I'm a little G throwin boulders from the shoulders
cuz I'd rolled cha like a motherfuckin joint
so just sit back for a second while I pull my point
I got it goin on like one two three
cuz now in '94 they can't see H-D
they wanna be like me, becuz my shit is poppin
I'm risin to the top and ain't no motherfucker stoppin
this gangsta from the Dogg Poud click
becuz I'm droppin nuttin but that cavvy shit
and now I gotsta take me a trip to get what I like
it's the 12 pacofdoja like I told cha
I will fold you like a letter
put on a sweater
cuz H-D dogg is comin out in any kind of weather
straight rockin the house for 9-4
with that mad ass eastside cavvy flow
so

[Lil' 1/2 Dead chorus 8x]
it's the 12 pacofdoja
I told cha befo' cha
here's a little G throwin boulders from the shoulders

[Lil' 1/2 Dead talkin]
yeah, ya know what I'm sayin
it's that 12 pacofdoja like I told cha
ya know what I'm sayin
I see how it froze your motherfuckin ass with that cavvy ass gangsta shit
