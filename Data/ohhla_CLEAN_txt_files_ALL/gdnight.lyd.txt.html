Typed by: AZ Lyrics

What if daddy was right?
What if there's no forever?
Would you kiss me goodnight?
So that I could remember?

Keep you frozen in time
Like they do in the pictures
And if I close my eyes,
Would I still think of patience?

Stay with me, don't disappear
To tell the truth, I need you here
I'm afraid, I can barely breath
I need your words, to comfort me
Say goodnight, would you say goodnight?

What if daddy was right?
And I knew all the answers?
But they could give me the world
But that wouldn't matter
And if the gates open wide, and make you an angel
Two tears in my eyes, I'd save you're seat at the table

Stay with me, don't disappear
To tell the truth, I need you here
I'm afraid, I can barely breath
I need your words, to comfort me
Say goodnight, would you say goodnight?</pre>
