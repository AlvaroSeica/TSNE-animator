It's Cha Cha, Noontime
Shekspere, Nine-nine

What cha wanna, what cha wanna
What cha wanna do
What cha wanna yeah
What cha wanna, what cha wanna
What cha wanna do

It's Cha Cha the Tuskadero the one they call most
I'm high post
So what I'm gonna sweat a broad for
Don't y'all know?
We ain't finished till it's almost
You gotta deal with a broad that ain't even 5'4
My live goal is  to send three or four in the Tahoe
To your door, visit courtesy of Tuskadero
Now where they going, from Detroit, yeah the capital
Which made us national, seven miles with haters after you
They sure to catch you
The vendettas, trend setters, and Benz getters
With big cheddar fellas, pay bills and just met us
The big set up, the big let up inside their leathers
Tical fellas spray for the baby
If she tell em, blast half your middle or half your nickel
On command in general, imagine me on my menstrual
And these broads ain't exempt, they get it good as him
Probably worse if the baby have to reach down in her purse

1  Yo what cha wanna do?
      Wanna ride with, wanna roll with the crew, get live with the crew?
      In 99, it's time to shine with the crew
      Yo what cha, what cha wanna do?
      What cha wanna do?
      Wanna ride with, wanna roll with the crew, get live with the crew?
      In 99, it's time to shine with the crew
      Yo what cha, what cha wanna do?

Why every time I leave the driveway y'all playas get sick
Is it cause I'm 18 with this four point six?
Come on y'all, y'all gotta admit I'm looking good in my whip
Couple carats in the air, twenty-seven on the wrist, you pissed
And I can tell by the way that you wave
Tell your peeps yeah she's cool but gots some funny acting ways
That some paper stacking stage that our minds all crave
And out it, we ain't got it, we gonna get it always

Repeat 1

Watch these feared one's glare through
Front how dare you?
Catch you backstage and wreck your twenty dollar hair-do
Yeah you ostrich, raising like you want shit
I'll break all these nails and just came from getting done
You ain't a broad
Turn around and face one
You'll be surprised who they hot ones and make ones
That's why they think I'm so hard to meet
When fact is they to intimidated to speak
Or maybe it is the physique
Size, zero petite
And this is way before I hit the charts and the streets
Who's she?
Tuskadero, trump tight with all aces
Angels with dirty faces, leave you in thirty paces
&gt;From heavy rotation to every rotation
The number one in the nation, especially on your station
They say it's over, and 99 they can't stop it
And if it's true remember I'm the last one that rocked it

Repeat 1 (2x)

What would you, would you, would you?
And if you could, could you what?
Would you, would you, would you?
And if you could, could you what?
Would you, would you, would you?
And if you could, could you what?
Would you, would you, would you?
And if you could would you?

What cha wanna, what cha wanna
What cha wanna do?
What cha wanna, what cha wanna
What cha wanna do?

Repeat 1

New millennium, Cha Cha
Yeah, trump tight, yeah, Noontime
Slick I see ya, what? what? what? what?
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Yo what cha wanna do?
Yo what cha wanna, what cha wanna, what cha wanna do?</pre>
