[K-Os]
Yo, check it out

[Verse 1]
When I rock it's like a deja vu
Revolution feel acu
When I grab this mic device and flip on all these [fuckin'] crews
I'm down for writers, breakers, movers and shakers
Illuminators
Somebody save us and take us to God who made us, blow
Liquor show, this is hip-hop
If I move to the east it still won't cease
So yo I don't stop
You get dropped by sonic waves
Caught in the maze ancient days
Heart of a lion, fire ablaze 'cause

[Chorus] - 2X
No time, so close
But it seems that there's just one blood
That's why, don't go
It's the one thing you can't think of

See what they were doin' was...enclosed..
Rooms and corporate structures
They were doin' experiments on MCs
So I broke out, and I came like this, yo

[Verse 1 - Repeat]

[Chorus] - 2X

[3X]
This is homicide, useless homicide

This is homicide</pre>
