How many times have you watched the sun rise
How many times have you looked deep into your lovers eyes
how many times have we spit phat rhymes
how many times
how many times
yo
how many rhymes would it take
just for you to relate
and understand that we're livin in a police state
how many a pretty penny I would guess
non the less
??? he's got us all desensitized under stress
how many tales of whore shore to shore
before the last days is here that for shore
how many days before we get more mature
and brothers with babies take care of there ladies
how many mics get crushed blown to dust
before we discover the true power within us
yo
how many times can we rhyme about the same thing
before we realize stand up we got to change things
how many times have you seen the sun set
how many times has your ass been in debt
how many times have you bumped our cassete?
how many times
how many times
yo
how many times do the seasons turn for babaloyn
burn this is my own concern to carry on
traditional listen yo
how many brothers tears have shed
by my people for over four hundred years
how many times have you lied cheated acted conceited
didn't needed you want it
how many times runnin
how many scars and cuts
bruises from the battle from those who got beef
how many ever seen cattle
killed in cold blood
so you can eat it up0
how much more till somebody says that's enough
how many times have you watched a full moon?
how many times have you cried alone in your room
how many times have you felt the bass boom?
how many times
how many times
yo
how many more of the hardcore rappers and gun clappers
gotta die before we realize ??zion i??
how many change in shadows
how much came in tobacco
how many bottles of 40 oz
death can we tackle
how many at the chapple
how many will be saved with fires rage
surface of earth is getting blazed
how many cause everyones got ??an opinion??
this is shit to zion crew expresses um
how many times has a baby been born
how many times has lightening stuck in a storm
how many times has your work been bought
how many times
how many times
yo how many times

*scratching*

how many live in the projects
how many have sex
before they fell in love
how many people forget
where they came from
i seen some people that lost
how many brothers get accused and hung on the cross
how many children get neglected
how many get raised
in the land of the empty
the home of the slaves
how many times can we rhyme about the same thing
before we realize stand up we got to change things
how many times has the sky dropped rain
how many times has your heart felt pain
how many times mastered again and again
how many times
how many times
how many times have you seen the sun rise
how many times you looked into your lovers eyes
how many times have we spit phat rhymes
how many times
how many times
how many times have you seen the sun set
how many times has your ass been in debt
how many times have you bumped our cassete?
how many times      *fades out*
how many times
how many times have you watched a full moon?
how many times have you cried alone in your room</pre>
