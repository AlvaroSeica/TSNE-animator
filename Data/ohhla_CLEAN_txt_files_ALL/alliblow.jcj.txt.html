Typed by: AZ Lyrics

That's trippy shit right here bruh

[Chorus]
Don't pass me no regular, I'm a turn it down
All I blow is loud, All I blow is loud
Don't pass me no regular, I'm a turn it down
All I blow is loud, All I blow is loud
I'm a turn it down, and be turnt up
I'm a turn it down, and be turnt up
I'm a turn it down, and be turnt up
I'm burnin' loud til my lungs burnt up

[Verse 1]
Smokin' gas in a rental
She givin' me mental
Countin faces (countin faces)
While she poppin molly like mentos
I got money forreal tho
Split blunts down the middle
I got love for everybody, who give a fuck how you feel though
In a big house with 10 hoes
Catch me in the hills blowin endo
Pool party, that's indoors
So much gin, take a swim ho
Homie pass the weed, let's get super high
I smoke that shit that made R. Kelly think that he could fly
Droppin racks off one plate
Took her to the strip then blew it
Took a lot of gin and some pills, took her to my hotel room like screw it
Smokin on pounds, smokin on pounds
In Seattle where ain't no crime
All I do is smoke weed and rhyme
Sip codeine just to eaze my mind

[Chorus]
Don't pass me no regular, I'm a turn it down
All I blow is loud, All I blow is loud
Don't pass me no regular, I'm a turn it down
All I blow is loud, All I blow is loud
I'm a turn it down, and be turnt up
I'm a turn it down, and be turnt up
I'm a turn it down, and be turnt up
I'm burnin' loud til my lungs burnt up

[Verse 2]
Chugging on lean and I'm chiefin on skunk
With yo man girl and I eat like it's lunch
Kick it so tough you would think I roll pine
Niggas so high you would think I'm gon jump
Upwards and down, it's just like a sea saw
Her titties keep bouncing just like a beach ball
She oh want em all to be smoking, we fuckin
On so many drugs that we can't sleep at all
Goons on my side, I got cars I don't drive
Got a bitch in my bed that's somebody's broad
Got kush in my blunt, got lean in my Sprite
I'm drunk as a fish and I'm high as a kite
Two down bitches and I'm in the middle
Maybach and my curtains I ain't got to the rental
I stay low, I look only in em
That's the killa loudpack in my cigarillo
No Reggie in my presence, tell them niggas get it right
I got girls doing girls now that's the shit I like
Now that's the shit I love, give me pussy money drugs
I take 30 out my stash then go blow it with my plug

[Chorus: x2]
Don't pass me no regular, I'm a turn it down
All I blow is loud, All I blow is loud
Don't pass me no regular, I'm a turn it down
All I blow is loud, All I blow is loud
I'm a turn it down, and be turnt up
I'm a turn it down, and be turnt up
I'm a turn it down, and be turnt up
I'm burnin' loud til my lungs burnt up</pre>
