[Lil' Platinum]
I'm Lil' Platinum every body knows me
They also know my songs are off the heezy
When I walk down the street all girlies headz turn
I'm so on fire, I give em heartburn
Try to start mess wit me and you'll be under sun
I rock Iceberg, Fubu and some Sean John
Even Look cute when I record a song
I'm so contagious I'll make you itch
Bling so much call me richie rich
13 years old and got the whole block shook
Spittin ILL rhymes that be off the hook
Have you sayin my name like Destiny's Child
Cause when I hit the stage you'll be bitin my style

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
I'ma young rhymer, I'ma young cat
I'ma young dawg, so give a shout out to dat

[Lil' J]
Stay your distance
And dont step outta line
Cause I'll blind you and freeze you wit my shine
Leave you like a snail without a spine
Have your open wounds burnin like iodine
All you haters need to step cause your in my line
Cause your raps is wack unlike my rhyme
I think its crazy how you fake dawgs try to ball
Cause when I step up your standin 2 feet tall
The industry is puttin out corny flakes like cereal
but they need to stick wit me cause I'm the raw material
I'ma rock the ice, and rock the mic
after you hear mah flow you gon want to start to fight
yes Kp is gon keep this lock down
While we keep you bumpin to our ill sound
Can you step to dis please, dont even bother
Lil' Platinum is out 1 luv Holla

[Chorus]</pre>
