[Verse 1]
Went from more marsh clears than mackage
Her man start M series the package
A good dude need a bad bitch
It's no reekin when the max lit
Still creepin with my last chick
Was pamperin niggas, trainin em how to have shit
Did a whole, fuck all I have shit
The winter too long to act like I never had shit
Pimp still on, winnin feel some
Said the young talent was swag like Ben Grill's son
Shots hittin the center, they tryina kill some
Quarter mill done, niggas slit like when the bill come
But thank God I know how to make shit
In ghetto gutter go in to take shit
Niggas we bank after bank, we try to rape shit
Then go drink after drink, and celebrate shit
Same class with street legends
Deep measures with niggas that blast the heat better
Funny style, don't laugh but speak clever
Dark knights, get you killed faster than Heath Ledger
Rap bane, 2 guns Max Payne
Pac came for the worst shower, Jack Chain
You catch change when getting some trap change
Arrogant, act strange, I'm cocky I act damed
Dash at me, you give me the ass pass you
65 clash you I be the swag master
Sensei Bentley washed in wax after
Hit all stars in the morn then sax after
If you ask for it, the arm lift
Rose is on the dashboard like one zip
Black everything, chrome rims, my arm sick
Knockin every track out without a bomb fist

[Chorus]
The game whack so I'm bout to get
Niggas in the trap like what's happennin
They wanna see a nigga rap again
I ain't on it but the homies not havin it
Niggas talk that fly shit,
I does that, that's my shit
They like V you ain't comfortable
You don't come from money, you ain't a Huxtable

[Verse 2]
I feel like a when he put out the Vanquish
Or like Ec when that SL was dangerous
It's too hot for these fake shits
I done got too hot was on my main shit
I played the block where ox rot and jay sit
Put my money on poo, G spot, he acin
I got 3 spots I'm chasin,
Dolla for dolla, servin out of my basement
I see a lot of replacements, we lean on you like we gotta be wasted
Just take what's out of the safe then
Too many keys, said he gotta be maintenance
I'm in the T top slot, it's been a month you niggas only rewind once,
Sellin d brown while d block buck,
In the town I put 8 balls like a Reebok tuck
Ah, you can smell the piff, ain't gotta open the bag you could tell it's it,
Yeah import her a bag it's what you tell this bitch
That's all corny and sad, I can tell you bitch

[Chorus]
The game whack so I'm bout to get
Niggas in the trap like what's happennin
They wanna see a nigga rap again
I ain't on it but the homies not havin it
Niggas talk that fly shit,
I does that, that's my shit
They like V you ain't comfortable
You don't come from money, you ain't a Huxtable</pre>
