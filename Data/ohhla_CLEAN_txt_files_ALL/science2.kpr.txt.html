Life in the Science Projects 
Life in the Science Projects

Life in the Science Projects 

[Killah Priest] 
The beginnin' and the endin' 
The departure of close friendships 
Here today and gon' tomorrow 
Why should death be full of sorrow? 
What do the pops of Marvin Gaye think about on Fathers Day? 
The last goodbyes are so hard to say, I pray 
God bless my oldest sister, knowin' I miss her 
Read the eulogy, refuse to speak on the pew wit the Preacher 
We're part of the Lost Tribes bought to these shores 
While America treated us evil, Deuteronomy speaks of the eagle 
And Obadiah put coals of fire on the heads of Edomites 
That won't give us our freedom rights 
Ask Willie Lynch what them demons were like? 
The slave scene swing low, sweet chariot 
Like HE from Nazareth will come 
Carry us away, but we still here today 
The children play in buildings, lookin' for a way 

(Hook) Priest 

[Killah Priest] 
Life and death is like a carnival the cemeteries 
Ain't nobody left that's honorable, they all been buried 
The Prodigal Son return as the product from slums 
Tattoos on his abdominal and glocks by his lungs 
Superstitious, crucifixes and horseshoes hang 
And grab nines, livin' room since I've been in the womb 
Stain - Glass window Church's, Friday night service 
Israelite curses, Five-Percenters recitin' their verses 
What's his real name? Allah, God or Jah, or is it Yah? 
Jesus or Jes√∫s? They greet and name Zues 
Yakob or Jacob or Ya'qub? Crips or Blood? 
Baby Crips to Pirus 
We went to Jesus Disciples to Gangster Disciples 
Till those angels invite you, pass them pearly gates 
Think of worldly place you'll like to escape
