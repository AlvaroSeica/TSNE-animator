[Off Topic]
I write a couple lines out
To photograph my thought
So when I'm overcome by toxins in my blood
It isn't lost
The more years I spend with time
I feel that it's not on my side
Though I turn the wheel and drive
I'm following directions, blind
Life is gonna suck no matter what
So make it kneel down
Give me what you love and watch me change what you're about
I've been around the block on foot
So I know the details
And if that's not cryptic enough
Then I'm not suited for retail
W04 stickers seem to linger
Like street corner cameras
Custom evidence configured
For the purpose of the quote, leaders
Comma, space, greed
Give me what you love and watch me change what you believe
I'm talking in my sleep
I'm sleeping on my feet
I'm marching to the beat
I'm starving for a feast
Everything seems petty to me
Like I'm elite
And I'm lost in a world of doubt with no beliefs

[Off Topic]
We don't ask for too much in our lives
We're just looking for a safe place to die

[Phase Fate]
Hang my head down low
These days found snow
Watch the wind blow leaves across my airflow
Watch my feet step on one another
As my laces get caught in summer
My toes are tangled, distraught and smothered
Cold extremities form frostbite
White ice slice nerves slight service slaves' rights
Counting days like mice in a plague
To take to the grave
I'm shoulderin' weight
I'm shoulderin' hate
For all that is great
And greater than me
Jealousy, envious, deny it
My very own Pontius Pilate
Terminal velocity reached
Like an unconscious pilot
My sanity breached
Red flowing seas turn violet
Now I cleanse it with bleach
I don't ask for much, for those goals I will reach
Please give me strength
For life's length
And those souls I teach
Those lessons of mine, with time
I try not to preach
Now its blood-letting
Setting sun
Forgetting none
What's done is done

[Phase Fate]
We don't ask for too much in our lives
We're just looking for a safe place to die
