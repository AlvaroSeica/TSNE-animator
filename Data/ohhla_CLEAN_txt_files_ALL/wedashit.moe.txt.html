[Chorus: Big Moe and Z-Ro]
{Big Moe]
Rolls wheels and roll over 
South side dozier
[Z-Ro]
We da shit bitch
I know you smell the odor
[Big Moe]
These boys raise hell push a V 12 motor
[Z-Ro]
 We da shit bitch
I know you smell the odor
Repeat 2x

[Verse 1: E.S.G.]
Now will the freestyle kings stand up?
Hol up I'm kinda sluggish with all this lean in my cup
I'm washed up
Redrum
Sittin in 22's
Wrist is cut
Like double Japanese tattoos
I paid dues
Tell them fools
Tell them feds I'm back
Ghetto breed pit bull 
I ain't scarred to scratch
I'm out the gate
Po eight
Cause I don't give a damn
HPD be lookin at me like my name was Gary Graham
Watch my trunk slam
And my crack fool
Nigga ride wit a fo fo
Bout to cock and hit you
Sue the sue
Paid my dues
Why do you be hatin on us
People wit lights
Lookin tight
Tookin the ice
He ready to bust
Switch the gus
Ounca
Diamonda
Tru to real
Hit mo green
Four fifteen
Six fifteen si real to real
Sandra hill
Sammy Sosa
I be livin la vida loca
E.S.G., Z-Ro, Big Moe
You know we takin over

[Chorus: Big Moe and Z-Ro]
Repeat 2x

[Verse 2: Big Moe]
That M O E
Barre sippers can't fuck wit me
Five dollas sippin drank blunt trees
Hit a cup and a pint and I'm still not pleased
Three deep screamin S U C
Hatas betta not plex wit me
I bet you can't get next to me
I'ma throw chunk deuce and ecstasy
They try to make me lose my mind
Fuck around and make me use my nine
That's why I gotta take a cruise up town
Playa hatas jockin beef droppin ? I'll come down
Ballin out of control
And my a c blow cold
Big Moe all up in yo face
Never need a sweet taste
Knockin off codeine by the caaaaase

[Chorus: Big Moe and Z-Ro]
Repeat 2x

[Verse 3: Z-Ro]
Guerilla mob run deep
And I'm representin forever
Them other two bitch made niggas getting tired of heffer
I'm all alone
Bring it on
Cause I get wet till I'm drippin
Fuckin wit Z-Ro
You be dealin wit rukas while they rippin
I'm still the Mo City don
Rap game phenomenon
Playin it raw
Wit niggas changin like chameleons
Sugar coated wit fillybusters to make em dance and stuff
Ol durag wearin ass nigga wit ya pant leg up
Lookin weaker than water
I start the easy contender
Reach my fo representer
Flew over the great over point a pena
Ya betta return the favor 
Cause we ain't havin that
S U C been wreckin since niggas been doin the cabbage patch
E.S.G. M O E and the A to the Z
Fuckin wit deadly niggas cocked up on three
Murder after murder wit plenty fedi in our hand 
So you can keep watchin me yaaaaaa

[Chorus: Big Moe and Z-Ro]
Repeat 2x

[Z-Ro]
The odor 
The odor
The odor</pre>
