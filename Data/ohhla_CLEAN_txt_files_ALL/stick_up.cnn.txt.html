[Verse One]
Slime they tried to stick you, we stuck them so fuck them
We robbed them then fucked them, fucked it up fuck shit
fuck they assumption

Them niggas nearly caught me slippin'
But my murder intuition told me start spittin'

Niggas like Lester Freeman, But ain't No HBO thang
No thang for the weekang

Slime my phone breakin up, meet me at the Marriot,
With heaters near shorty in the blue caddy drop

Yea, Im on that metro chip joint
Just left the strip joint

Dont forget to bring the big joint, 
Yo I got a puerto-rican ho that'll set 'em up, you wet em up
I know where they hang on the regular

Been hit up diamonds only spanish chick in the club knew me
From Cheetah's when I busted in her hair we got groovy (hey)
She said her name diamond but I treat her like a ruby

Slime it's time to make a movie!

[Chorus 2x]
Yo It's a stick up Yo!
It's a Stick Up Low!
You Motherfuckers just know how a stick up go!!
(Put ya hands up nigga! It's a stick up nigga!)
(it's time to stick them niggas, time to sick these niggas)
(Dont turn around nigga!)
(it's time to stick them niggas, time to sick these niggas)
(Put Everything on the floor.)
(Everthing!)

[Verse Two]
Yea, Do it considerably
Dope, weed, cocaine still comes from Cicaly

No games officially, put in that work and breeze
We smokin' the weed, Slime who gon' move the keys?

Mike Booth Gibrazzi, still like my right hand, 
Hand swollen from cuttin coke from his right hand

Thats the right plan, keep a close knit circle
About to roll up, light me some of this purple

Yea, I caught the niggas creep cuz they real sneaky fucks
Be in Milwauke, but we'll get 'em for they bucks.

Soon as they hop out the car, I'll be laid in the cut
Tryin' to get 'em If they
front, I'll just spray em up

Soon as they get out the car, the culture culture on 'em
The 4-4 long feelin' like a vulture on 'em

Nobody move, nobody gets shot
Oh, you the stupid nigga down to die for your watch?

Na he a stupid nigga that wont ride for his block
He the stupid nigga that'll ride with a cop

[Chorus 2x]
Yo It's a stick up Yo
It's a Stick Up Low
You Motherfuckers just know how a stick up go
(Put ya hands up nigga, 
It's a stick up nigga!)
(it's time to stick them niggas, yo)
(Dont turn around nigga!
put everything on the floor!
Everything!)
(it's time to stick them niggas, time to sick these niggas)

[Verse Three]
Yea caught him for the forty bricks and the forty thou
I had the 40 cal then I drank a 40 wowww!

We was drunk reminicin on the stick
Polishin' them burners bout' to catch another lick

Ay ayo what up Slime (What up? What up? whats goin' on man?) 
Yea I heard these niggas they got money on us, man (What?? niggas crazy)
On our head (what?!)

25 stacks I tell 'em get they money back
They know how we move every day with the strap

[Chorus 2x]
Yo It's a stick up Yo
It's a Stick Up Low
You Motherfuckers just know how a stick up go
Put ya hands up nigga
Stick up nigga!
(it's time to stick them niggas, time to sick these niggas)

[Outro]
Yo slime! Yea Yo slime!  
What up what up?
Yo hold on right

Cuz I think I hear somebody coming right now, hold on I think I hear somebody comin
