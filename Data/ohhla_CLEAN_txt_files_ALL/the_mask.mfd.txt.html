[Intro: song sample]
"Is it much, too much to ask
Not to hide behind the mask"

[MF Doom]
Head on straight, mask on crooked
Exit stage left, with the cast on crooked
Off like a khufi, the figure's a big doofy
He tried to get schoolie, with that tool for you
One two for me G, cut the cranky attitude
Wet 'em like a handkerchief, or a stanky fatter dude
Whether you'se a rapper or a damn singer
Once you in there's only one way out, like a gang banger
With a new crew key chain, and street name
What set do he claim for fame, game
Just to keep feather and stay dipped
You need it like a letter, or better a get away whip
This old thing's rusted and crusted as the bowl
Rings the all kings busted
Planning in, global starvation and fat herb
Now what in tarnation did I go and do that for?
Stuff happens, like getting snuffed for tough tit rappings
See I told him enough, quit your yapping
The same apply to any and all chumps
The only question he had for y'all was how many lumps
Three or four, either or
Mon cheri amore, so why you need your heater for?
The super villain slid in your party for free
Want an MC, get out of here, kid, you bother me

[Ghostface Killah]
The day I took my mask off
My face was missing for two days
For the record, G, came back a year later
A whole new identity, Toney Starks pedigree
My money green like my nickname was celery
Who is Ghost? He flashed his toast
Never wore sheets, but bulletproof coats
Oh no! The feds cried for the mask back on
Told them Ghost is dead, he'll return at the crack of dawn
Few years from now, him and his pals
Before the Jetson era will rock, he'll be back summer time 2005
With a half of face iron, the other half water, look like alien science
In the summer time, you can see the face boil
But the other side, I keep luke with the Pennzoil
Mad loyal, when the winter time come, I gets stuck with my brain all numb
Like I ate thousand icey's and frozen Pepsi's
Aquaman's pops can't water check me, disrespect me, indirectly
I seen his feet and they both lefty, he steppin' half correctly
As I stroll the globe and terrorize the planet
With a Bill Clinton mask and them Playskool hens
Me and Doom, always be the best on the landing
Superheroes for life until our souls vanish

[Outro: Brak from Space Ghost]
Check me out my name is Brak and not to fuck
I got a mom and a dad and they all outback
We're sitting by the pool, and we never on snacks
And we eat a big lunch and we all take naps
Why the beat stop? Hey! Hey!
I got a Mask too, so give me a mic! (You're no Doom!)
Come on Danger Mouse, give me that beat!
Turn the beat around, love to hear precaution
(You suck) Turn it upside down!
Love to hear the... (I'm know talent, and you ain't got it)
I wasn't done!</pre>
