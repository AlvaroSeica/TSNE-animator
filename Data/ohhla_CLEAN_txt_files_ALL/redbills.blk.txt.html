Fuck around and get ya head cut off 'round here nigga
YOU fuck around and get ya head cut off 'round here..

Sickenin'
Poverty Stricken
WE runnin' 'round like a chicken with his head cut off
WE unlawful
YEA BUDDY
Whole block full of Ted Bundy's for that Red Money
Meaning that Bloddy Money, yea we hungry hungry
AHH!
Sittin' on the toilet, thinkin' 'bout a Fortune
And how the Rich stay shittin' on the less fortunate
I mean I'm sittin' on the Throne
Thinkin' how can WE get on?
I'm just trynna stay eatin' llike Jesus and his peoples
When Judas turned Thriller he know he was gon' be Tito, (Woah)
Am I my brother's keep-NO
Man's best friends' the Desert Eagle, OW!
Savage, put a hole in his cabbage
for a little dough and a Zoe Kravitz
Give 'em the Green Light and they OG backwards
...Shootin' like Kobe practice, (Kobe!)
On the run like if Jackie Kersey snatched a purse
Muhfuck the police they gon' have to work
Niggas doin' dirt and gravel work..
Goin' crazy for that bloody money

CHORUS:
Red Bills (Red Bills)
Red Bills (Red Bills)
Niggas head over heels for them Red Bills
Red Bills (Red Bills)
Red Bills (Red Bills)
Goin' head over heels for them Red Bills
Red Bills (Red Bills)
Red Bills (Red Bills)
Niggas head over heels for them Red Bills

Now for the Loot, for the purse
What would YOU Do? Steal?
Would YOU shoot the Gift if the Curse got Real?
Rappers talk Loud always raging bout Fightin'
wouldn't dive in the crowd if the stage was on Fire. (Fire, Fire)
THE ROOF IS ON FIRE
Fuck the glass ceiling when the Roof is on Fire. (Fire)
Killa put ya Hoody on tighter
For a bag of Skittles they be shootin' on minors
Just flash on em with ya Black Light
Black Life worth less than a Crack Pipe
Act Right, YOUR Next
Thats the threat Night after Night like YOUR Life got a Debt Price
Question EVERYTHING, even YOUR Team
Lost Souls in the Trap for the CREAM
Blood drippin' off the Cross and the diamond ring
Them Red Faces on the Dollar for the Murder Game

CHORUS:
Red Bills (Red Bills)
Red Bills (Red Bills)
Niggas head over heels for them Red Bills
Red Bills (Red Bills)
Red Bills (Red Bills)
Goin' head over heels for them Red Bills
Red Bills (Red Bills)
Red Bills (Red Bills)
Niggas head over heels for them Red Bills</pre>
