[Angie Stone]
Uh, uh, uh
What? Check it out
Angie Stone on the remix with who?
Neptune, uh

I've had my bouts with love
I've been going through things you never heard of
Breakin' up and gettin' back together
Faced with all kinds of stormy weather
There was a time thought I'd lose my mind
My friends and family warned me
Time after time after time

[Chorus: Angie Stone]
Tell me how you gonna get something
When all you gave up, was nothing
Every day, every day, every day baby
You twisted my heart
Tell me why is it that I'm buggin'Now that I've got everything
Every day, every way you gonna pay

Now baby it took a few
For me to get over you
I didn't think I could make it
But my faith in God said I could check it
Back in the day I wasn't good enough for you
I would do anything to win you over
You took advantage of my attention
Oh, did I forget to mention
Every day you did the same thing
And every hour you'd switch up on me
Every minute I'd be forgiving
Every second we'd be reliving
Every day you did the same thing
And every hour you'd switch up on me
Every minute I'd be forgiving
And every second we'd be reliving

[Chorus]

[Pusha T]
Yo, yo, uh
How you only recall the rough times?
We ain't laugh late nights watching Loveline
I ain't rubbed your back, you ain't rubbed mine
I ain't kissed on yours, you ain't kissed mine
I guess you the only one hurt
Like I don't miss by the hand up your skirt
With my chrome in your purse
There's a lot chicks out here loving to flirt
You got my name in the streets
They just lovin' the dirt
What? I ain't keep 88 in the lining
Couldn't divide 'em only if I slide 'em, straight grinding
Moon shining getting cake till down
Amnesia huh? I ain't take you on
Shopping sprees to D.C. order from Rodeo
Spilt the credit card number only if I say so
Packing that pack and packing that mack
You know what this is why you actin' like that?

[Chorus]

Well, it was your attitude much too shrewd
Caused you to lose, now who's the fool?
It was your attitude much too shrewd
Caused you to lose, now who's the fool?
Cause all I had is love for you
And there ain't nothing more to do
Cause I had a crazy, crazy, crazy love baby, babe, baby, baby yeah
See when you come home early
Don't come with that freaking respect
Cause I ain't got no time for packing up your, ooh

Uh, keep it hot, ooh, ooh ah, ooh

[Chorus]</pre>
