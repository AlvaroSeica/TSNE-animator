[Verse 1: Bliss]
Yo I know a place that you lot can play
It's a party that you can hear like two blocks away
Fuck an attitude and fuck the right to prepare what to wear
Fuck driving I rolled up on a barrel of beer 
And bustin through the door to Bliss N Eso bustin the speakers 
It's so packed in here that I'm steppin on sneakers
But this MC corners me, he's got my patience spent
'Cause he's wack but thinks he's the shit like David Brent
Gave me his demo to sus, He wouldn't let go of my nuts 
I was like "Dude I'll be right back just need a bevo to clutch" 
Yo Bevo what's up 
I got the erge to write a sentance
Izm rocked up with 3 Virgin flight attendents
When his beer runs out there'll be some trouble and some bugging 
So open the fridge and stash the couple in the oven
I'm a sneaky little cunty but believe me 
it was funny when I found two mingers gettin' freaky in the dunny
("Wait Thats Not A Girl, what's up bro") 

[Verse 2: Motley]
It's me Motley
Didn't I tell you fuckers to watch me
Bliss you know I'm pissed man you should've stopped me (*hick up*) 
Now I'm drunk and this fat chicks got me
Hand-cuffed to the taps and now she's filling the bath 
I'm from the UK so she love the way that I rap 
But the bitch got sideburns worst than Shaft
Shits not funny man please don't laugh
That's when Eso bust down the door 

[Eso]
Ay yo get your ass up off my bathroom floor
You've only had a couple of drinks we got more 
It's beer o'clock bro I told you before
Now hit this weed

[Motley]
But I don't smoke 
Ahh what the hell man just one toke

[Eso]
Nah take two hits but watch you don't
(Motley: w-w-watch y-y-ou don't choke)

[Chorus: {Bliss}]
Well there's a party at my place n you're all invited 
A place to just chill, get ill and spend the night in
You like that? "Hell yeh" 
Well get amongst the buzz and crack a night cap bro, this one's on us 
Well there's a party at my place n you're all invited 
A place to just chill, get ill and spend the night in
You like that? "Hell yeh" 
Well get amongst the buzz and crack a night cap bro, this one's on us 

[Verse 3: Eso]
Ay yo it's freak fest two double o' five
It's quiete in the hood but there's trouble at mine
Brothers that are broke, we don't know how to be rich 
There's stolen steaks on the barbie on my balcony bitch 
I'm teaching newcomers how shape n make a bong
While Bliss hides my beer so we can take em' later on 
Plus the colour of my c'mons like the Canberra Raiders
It got me crackin' jokes with Izm playin' San Andres 
We got the whole block shacking outrageous 
'cause a party ain't a party without waking your neighbours 
Or makin' arrangements to go break in a basement 
and steal another mother fucking case for these cavemen
Kicking flows freestyling on some ill shit
If you ain't down with us then you not on the bill kid 
So piss off 'cause this cost nothing for my brothers 
Just a house party full of nuttty mother fuckers 
So bounce, break something, shake the house down 
Get on a stage and then make the crowd shout 
Bounce, break something, shake the house down 
Get on a stage and then make the crowd shout

[Chorus]

[Hook]
Party people in the place I'd like to get to know ya 
Party people in the place I'd like to get to know ya 
First push up your hands if you're a weed smoker

[Verse 4: Motley]
Look I'm so busy Esy Izm got busy on the ones and twisy two's 
Now I'm drinkin' Victoria Bitter out of my shoes
That's when Bliss told me the bad news

[Bliss]
The door bust open there was two cops to see 
They turned the music off and said "Who'se got the weed?"
and everyone went quite
But then they told us the point 
"Carm down love, just roll a cop or a joint" 

[Chorus]

[Verse 5: Eso]
It goes on and on and on till the break of break of dawn 
Everybody gettin' loose, everybody gettin' on
and it's all good 
That's the moto so grab a bevo n let go until tomorrow 

[Hook]
Party People In Place The I'd Like To Get To Know Ya 
Girls shaking their tutsies
With a bim bam boogie and a bottle of whisky...
[Eso]
'Cause its my house, my crib, my kingdom 
where the floorboards creek and the kids keep singing</pre>
