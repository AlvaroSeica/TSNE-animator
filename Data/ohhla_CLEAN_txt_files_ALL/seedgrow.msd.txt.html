[Verse One: Kymani Marley]
Yo oh
At first glance it's like cupid hit
Mesmorised by her thighs and her hips
So, she went ahead and find a man wit' some chips
And left school when she cop da whip
Caught in the game
Locked in the speedin' lane
Livin a life for money, drugs and fame
But true love is what she can't entertain
And every chance she get she's given the blame
Then she askin' why
I told she was livin a lie
When I told her she started to cry
Don't just sit and let life pass you by
And I slowly wiped the tears from her eyes

[Chorus]
I told her to take it slow
Girl give it time to flow
And from a seed to a flower you'll grow
So many seeds on the street
No sunshine but always heat
And lives are lost at every heartbeat
I told her take it slow
Girl give it time to flow
And from a seed to a flower you'll grow
So many seeds on the street
No sunshine but always heat
Drownin' in poverty and deceit
But black roses grow from concrete

[Verse Two: Ms. Dynamite]
He got a family to feed
So every night he out on the street
Shottin poison to young mothers and youths dem
Cause he feel it the only way to keep his peeps on they feet
Makes ends meet
And gets his own up out of poverty
Until one night
He came home to find his mother cry
She pointed to the floor and he saw a trail of his supply
She led him to his room to find his brother on his bed
Track marks
Needle in his arm and stone cold dead
And suddenly
They all flashed before his eyes
The kids that he sold to
And they mothers cries
Every child is someones child
You affa a mind what you do
Cos Karma gunna bring the drama back on you

Do what you gotta do
But nigga when it comes to them youths
There is no excuse
Our future that
We supposed to nurture that
Nah lettin nuttin or nobody hurt that
Do what you gotta do
But nigga when it comes to them youths
There is no excuse
Our future that
We supposed to nurture that
Nah lettin nuttin or nobody hurt that

[Repeat Chorus]</pre>
