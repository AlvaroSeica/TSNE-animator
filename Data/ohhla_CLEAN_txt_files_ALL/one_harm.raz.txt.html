[Intro: Hell Razah]
We bout to blow it, yeah, Rebel Music, raise your hand up
4th Disciple, G.G.O., 4th Disciple, G.G.O.
Razah, G.G.O., Razah G.G.O.
4th Disciple, G.G.O., Malachi, G.G.O.

[Hell Razah]
I got them scared I'mma shine, because my mind be ahead of it's time
I be the future, terrorist to niggaz that sign
Got more than Valentine, twelve contract binds
We my guns outta Palestine, to silence my nine
It's either God or the the devil, better balance your mind
The Black Libra, raise amongst crack leaders
If the Hebrews is Jews, it's a Black Jesus
So I'mma tear Satan's kingdom down like Shirley
Ceaser, dedicated to the great achivers
The late comers and the early leavers, get it early, I ain't wordly neither
Archangel in this armageddon, who be a calm weapon
More deadly than the bomb threaten, rock the mic til my palms sweating
We be the bride, walkin' to God's wedding, all I gave was brotherly love
Now they act, wired and bugged, like CIA's supplying them drugs
Who can trust in these last days, hold ya breath when the gas sprays
My projects is a crack maze, that was built for a black slave
To keep us heading to a fast braid, same shit different last names
Ya'll gettin' caught up in this rap game, rap game

[Chorus 2X: Hell Razah]
I'm reality, poverty, poetry, prophecy
Honesty, pain that's in one harmony
Pardon me, for the steppin' on toes
But we ain't came here to bag your hoes, we came to
bring back soul

[Interlude: Hell Razah]
Yeah, Sunny Jewels that be G.G.O.
Killah Priest, that be G.G.O.
Prodigal Sunn, be G.G.O.
60 Sec., that be G.G.O.
Shabazz, that be G.G.O.
This be G.G.O.

[Hell Razah]
Roll out the red carpet, insert the cartridge
I got a hunger like a hostage, in Kosovo, run and tell so and so
Bop your head to my promo, we went from water guns to four-fours
To breakin' government through barcodes
Now it's man verse computer, eight thousand CC's of brain
You fell in love with what you can't even claim
I can't maintain to watch no blood suckers campaign
Prayers and pain, for months turn to tear drops of rain
I stay ghetto like the A train, survived all this crack and cocaine
And still alive so we can rap and complain
Now we done dropped out to get cream, since school teachers is turning to fiends
Strip dancers comin' out they g-strings
Nice thighs in them iceberg jeans, projects we the nation of kings
You too fly, then I'mma clip wings, we go to work while others'll sling
Audi's and teens, and d's smoke weed til it's dark and cloudy
Don't fuckin' crowd me, I'm too deep, you can't count me
Ask Bush while we flippin', and we gettin' rowdy
We the last one left up in this King's country
We the last one left up in this King's country

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
