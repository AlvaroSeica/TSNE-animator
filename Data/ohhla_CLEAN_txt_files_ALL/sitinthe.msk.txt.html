Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Bitches come and go yet they talk a lot of shit behind your back
but in your face they don't say nada saying this and that
cause the puta had a big mouth osico
that she used to suck the homie when she got down
and they pretend that they don't know who the fuck this shit is
when the whole fucken quadra knows that she's a whore
it's plain and simple she don't need to explain
they already got a clue to scandalous shit
she bring it's not to long before she tries
and take your vato you can either cry about it
or sentarla bien sentaso pensilo bien
if it was me I would just do it but then again
that's just me crazy locs that's how I handle it
fuck the hair pulling come back and just laugh at it
Scandalous ass hoe move out my way before
I'm done with it she's the kind of chick that likes to schedule her fights
and says meet me at the parque at a quarter to five so I was

Sittin at the park waiting for you
Sitting at the parke kickin back by my lonesome not givin a fuck always ready if they want some
Sittin at the park waiting for you
Another day another puta that talks another bitch should joyride In the back of my trunk

And I ain't taking pendejadas from no body te lo digo
I don't care how fucken hard you think you look drivin that rego
but I'm sittng my ass down esperandole en el parke
that bitch ain't showin up I bet que quiere que me large
I called the home girl Sonia and I asked about that rucka
she said that she's been known to never come thru for a bronca
but fuck that I'm waiting but the trampa never showed up
instead I seen her jefa damn que risa hold up
walking like she has a fucken broom up her culo
another pinche juego from a ni√±a que no pudo
venia ella solita so she had to go and snitch
cause she really think I gave a fuck about that bitch
cause on the serio I'm a tell you how I see it fake ass
homies how a dama does it you best belive it raking
now every fucken chansa they get like the homies
that I use to kick it with bunch of bullshit

Sittin at the park waiting for you
Sitting at the pake kickin back by my lonesome not givin a fuck always ready if they want some
Sittin at the park waiting for you
Another day another puta that talks another bitch should joyride In the back of my trunk

Ya las cosas an cambiado do from lo down to a jefa
but you can still catch me saying fuck a bitch
and fuck a leva segun que muy amigas
then they stab you in el espalda pendejas se suena mas bien siendo
carga you always have to deal with the stupid shit she bring
and you never told no body but the vato she was with
but now all of a sudden got a reason to talk
and she's going around saying shit that you never thought
the way she looked at your mijo made you think there was algo
you never paid attention, didn't think nada malo
but fuck that a bitch comes at my vato
then she's getting it full blown desmadre que se hace
you can bet on it cause ain't no hoody playin me
for somebody que no sabe I know exactly como le hace
and I ain't down to let nobody take what's mine
y yo entiero lo que venga even if I do the time

Sitttin at the park waiting for you
Sitting at the pake kickin back by my lonesome not givin a fuck always ready if they want some
Sittin at the park waiting for you
Another day another puta that talks another bitch should joyride In the back of my trunk</pre>
