[Verse 1]
Yo, 24-7 365 days niggas coming sideways
not me, some are sloppy
My syyle's sharper than a 3 piece suit
Plus a tie and deeper than the look in a thug's eye
Why do slugs fly ask youself that
Why does Uncle Sam got us held back
My niggas sell crack to survive
Dun, it aint what you wear its what you drive
Them crackers in the bank dont give a fuck if you live
No affense, but yall just gotta know that its tense
Im energized everytime I rhyme I go the length
From point A to point Z you must have slept
I guess you never realize how high my joints be
So turn it up I found a new way to earn a buck
Rapping for the people hustlers and murderers
Doctors and lawers cops and Tom Sawyers
Type niggas ball players earning nice figures
Everybody play my shit loud at every party
Bitches get dicked down
Now they praying that they pregnant by me
On purpose, I be that nigga that you worship
Staying in your tape deck spraying your favorite verses
Again and again peep my adrenalin
Thugged the fuck out
At the same time a perfect gentleman

(Chorus: repeat 4x)
You aint never hear no shit like this
You aint never hear no shit like this

[Verse 2] (beat change)
Now who else can take a beat like this and twist it
Speak wisdom, and sound clear on a cheap system
It gotta be me you know my policy
I keep you on your toes
Like high heel shoes for real though
Irratating like when your beard grow
Try to trim it
The hottest nigga in the rap game with out a gimic
Keep my hat on matching my wears
Bitches ask me for loot
Only after my deal its all real
Critically acclaim my shit bangs
From here to Quebec
Niggas show me either fear or respect
You can dance put your ear to the deck
either or, you can play it at work
Try to teach your boss
Messing with fate
Yall fake niggas stay stressing my tape
Think yall ready for hits
step up next to the plate
With your low percentage low value no value
Your shit's slow-mo mine's is thrown at you homo
I dont make the rules nigga I just break em
Rap for the fools lay my jewels out for the taking
Pick em up listen well
Critics predicted since the Firm that my shit will sell
Straight doing it, can you picture me not moving em
You know you love it so much you copped 2 of them</pre>
