Song:   Return to Forever
Typed by: Cno Evil

[Intro: Blue Raspberry]
This song is about the circle of life
And also about someone that I lost and truly loved
I wish I had them back

[Blue Raspberry]
Days floating round the bay
Through the rainbow sail, return to forever
Nights, ring around the moon
Ending all too soon, return to forever

[Chorus: Blue Raspberry]
When we reach the autumn's bay
And I wish that we, we're young again
Having you the first, in time
If only we knew now, what we did then

[Blue Raspberry]
Clouds, along across the sky
Changing as they flow, return to forever
Wasted rush to kiss the shore
Once, and never more, go back, return to forever

[Chorus II: Blue Raspberry]
How I wish that you were mine
And we could live again, on summer time
To leave this happiness, this once, again
If only we knew now, what we did then

[Blue Raspberry]
A child, holding out your hand
Please, try to understand, return to forever
Please, wasted rush to kiss the shore
Once, and never more, go back, return to forever

[Chorus]

[Chorus II]
