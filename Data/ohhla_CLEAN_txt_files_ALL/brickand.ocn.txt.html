[Frank Ocean]
If a tree fell in the forest
And no one's around to hear it
Baby, does it go boom? Does it go boom?
If I have love for ya
But you were never close enough to feel it
Is my love any good? Is my love any good? Ohhh

[Chorus]
But the distance ain't even a room away
You're layin in the bed right next to me
But there might as well be a brick wall in between us
Some soundproof glass and some bars in the middle
Oh baby, when I wanna talk to you
I'm conversin with bricks, and steel, a pile of bricks, and steel
And when I tap your shoulder
You're cold as bricks, and steel, a pile of bricks, and steel
And how do I stay in love with you?
Ravish all the the leftovers and garbage
Was it ever real, if you were never here?
Bricks, and steel, walk around the kitchen
like a pile of bricks and steel
Bricks bricks, steel steel

[Frank Ocean]
I know you're somewhere in there
Sometimes I wanna pick up a hammer
And start chiselin away, away; chiselin away, away
Girl my phone bill is crazy
The rate is sky high when I call ya
But you only let it ring, you only let it ring, no

[Chorus]

[Frank Ocean]
Stomp, stomp, I think I hear 'em comin down the hall
He don't hear a word I say at all
I'm wishing these four walls could talk, talk
Oh, stomp, stomp
I think I hear 'em comin down the hall and
And he don't hear a word I say at all

[Chorus]</pre>
