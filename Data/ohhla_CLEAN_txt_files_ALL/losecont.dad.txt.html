Zumba, zumba, zu-zumba
Zu-zumba, zu-zumba

I see you stare, which looking at body
Dance with no care
It's obvious that you need to appear
Let's turn off all lights and sing in your air

Shake your body
Rock your body
We ain't stopping til the early morning
[x5]

Let me lose control your body
let me lose control..
Let me lose control your body
let me lose control..
let's go!

Candela, candela, candela..

I'm in the place you never go
I'm in my bottles going low
Ya t√∫ sabes so dedicated so
Go waist some tavern
My morning drinks won't ease
Take you rum pa-pam the beat
Compararme con I'm here and I'm glad
Came little late
just give me enough space..

Dance here to my bottom
Right hand in the air
Live your life like you want to
Party night, we don't care!

See in your eyes the simple seduction
It kills me inside
You got what i want it, and i want tonight
Let's turn off the lights
Snd speak up our lives

Let me lose control your body
let me lose control..
Let me lose control your body
let me lose control..
Vivo!

That's how we roll, rol!
That's how we roll, rol!

Shake your body
Rock your body
We ain't stopping til the early morning
[x4]

Let me lose control your body
let me lose control..
Let me lose control your body
let me lose control..

That's how we roll, rol!
That's how we roll, rol!</pre>
