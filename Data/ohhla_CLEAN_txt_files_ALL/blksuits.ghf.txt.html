[Ghostface Killah]
Young aggressor, born into the life of crime
I will walk down the street, strapped with two nines
Bitch smackin', jackin' niggas, G'd up, stacking figures
Police drive by, I was click-clackin' triggers
Jay DeLuca's, put me with the fam to grow
I was a boss amongst white boys, rocking the 'fro
I had hoes, bankrolls and minks by the dozen
My rise to power was quick, they just wasn't
Trying to make me a made man, they fucked up the game plan
I blacked out on 'em, and started my own Clan
Black Gambino, black suits, the black syndicate
My crime fam was tight, every move was intricate
The coke was brought in from bad Colombian mules
Gorgeous women that I draped down in jewels
Street fights started, mafia wars from Italy
Crime fam against fam and no one could do diddly

[Chorus: Ghostface Killah]
Do the dirty work, ring in the coke by the boatloads
Go against the grain, nigga, I feed those hoes
Follow no family rules, rules are for fools
Chase the paper, cause it's the cash that rules

[Ghostface Killah]
Fuck the, law of the fam, it's the, law of the land
You don't like how I move, and then try to force my hand
Then moving keys, them DeLuca's couldn't touch my pianos
Putting pressures on them Gambiny and Verrazzano's
They love my money, they hate to see a nigga getting it
Selling drugs is taboo, but I ain't fucking sweatin' it
The dirt gotta get done, so I took my position
One day I'm just black Tone with a lot of ambition
Next, I got status, dinners with all the bosses
Flights in and out of the country, they getting nauseous
Money, power, respect, rise of the black suits
Talk shit behind my back, but to my face, salute
Hugs and handshakes, they can't stop my reign
Got the coconut, pilots bringing shit on the plane
It's a shame, they ain't have the balls to make moves
They pussy, couldn't walk a mile in my shoes

[Chorus 2X] </pre>
