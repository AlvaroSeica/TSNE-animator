Put it on y'all...(*X4*)

[Verse 1]
We the survivors, the hustlers
gusslers, the riders, we don't know no busters
suprise 'em with guns and knuckles
they bound to be broken' buckle
been down before thuggish ruggish
come around with my motherfuckers
and let God keep it bumpin', love you
this money do wonders for me
you know me from Bone Thugs, so show me some Bone love
my (?) is strong love, drink forty's and smoke blunts
Still, I'm givin' all the shots
to the St. Claire Thugs in the glock, glock
for the niggaz on hot-blocks
bustin' back at the cops boy
you can't stop me, I'm up in your shit like papparazzi
Competition is sloppy
draw position, not even worthy got me poppin'
cause if you want me, buckin' them bloody body
they never did wanna come fuck with the thugs
they comin' to shoot up your posse
shoot up your posse, livin' with trill niggaz
If you don't true with real killas
on the road to this meal ticket
My mister was still with me, the lyrics is ill wicked
and niggaz is still trippin', and talkin' shit after this one
we gon' get up in that grill, hear me..

[Chorus]
Won't weep no more, won't sleep no more
won't be no more once we
Put it on... dogg, won't weep no more
won't sleep no more, won't
Be no more once we put it on... dogg

[Verse 2]
Ever since I complete my mission
ten years and they still listenin'
when you see me you know me
but excuse me don't fuck with no bitch niggaz,
eads blown, heads gone, if they step in Bone
we let 'em know, straight from the do', just where we comin' from
let it go and reload, if you need some mo' let 'em know
there's mo', we split it, gon' pull it
no matter them thugs gon' get with ya killa
day time or at night when your kissin' baby night-night
you can die, rock-a-bye, got thugs but they ain't leaders
we thugs for a fuckin' reason
scuffed up, fucked up, leave 'em in the mud
That's how you gotta leave 'em, body bags
It's no trash bag, they pickin' up the pieces
Niggaz is hungry Dogg, they flossin' so get 'em dogg
If bitches step on it too straight up thuggin' to get you
that Gucci, that bling ooh, gotta (?) with niggaz
who they will murder y'all, sit 'em up
and there and then we rush all y'all
that's thugster shit, that's how we roll..

[Chorus]

Won't weep no more, won't sleep no more
won't be no more once we
Put it on... dogg, won't weep no more
won't sleep no more, won't
Be no more once we put it on... dogg </pre>
