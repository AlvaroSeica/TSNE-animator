[Intro: Ice-T]
Necessary evil

[Ice-T]
Look outside my window, I still see a fucked up world
Waking up to helicopter and car alarms
Does this happen where you live?
Gunshots sound in my mind
I don't flinch anymore, when I see niggaz in my hood
They're holding their dicks tight

[Ice-T]
Yo, fuck my landlord
I'm a step away from clearing this shotgun
To erase the problem
Does this happen where you live?
Just had Steak and Lobster last night
Now I gotta rob a Liquor Store
But it seems so normal
Because it's necessary evil

[Ernie C]
Car hit my dog, babies die
Raped in a stairwell, cop killed a little girl
Armed robbery, shooter of a drive-by
Smoking Cain, selling joints in junior High
Head from a minor, sex with animals
Butt hole surfers, a fucked up rehearsal
Lost pawn ticket, wrecked my father's car
Can't pay my school loan, major Jack Move
Holy underwear, stuck in the pen'
Forced in a gang, plain wrapped food
Fucked up presidents, sleeping through trash day
Hit a police car, getting laid off
Gotta pay Taxes, gridlock traffic
Jealous motherfuckers, bitch tried to do me
HIT AND RUN!! I GOT A FAT BITCH PREGNANT!! 

[Ice-T]
Necessary evil

[Ice-T]
Little white kid with a Kool-Aid smile
Training wheels on his bike 
Thought he called me a nigga
Pushed that little bastard in traffic so graphic
He was holding his bike tight
He was a victim of fucked up explaining
An American example of fucked training
When the fucking bus connected, he flew like Knievel
It was just necessary evil

[Ernie C]
Car hit my dog, babies die
Raped in a stairwell, cop killed a little girl
Armed robbery, shooter of a drive-by
Smoking Cain, selling joints in junior High
Head from a minor, sex with animals
Butt hole surfers, a fucked up rehearsal
Lost pawn ticket, wrecked my father's car
Can't pay my school loan, major Jack Move
Holy underwear, stuck in the pen'
Forced in a gang, plain wrapped food
Fucked up presidents, sleeping through trash day
Hit a police car, getting laid off
Gotta pay Taxes, gridlock traffic
Jealous motherfuckers, bitch tried to do me
HIT AND RUN!! I GOT A FAT BITCH PREGNANT!! 

[Outro: Ice-T]
NECESSARY EVIL!!</pre>
