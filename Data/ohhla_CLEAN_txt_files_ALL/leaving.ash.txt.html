(Chorus 1:Ashanti)
If you were me, what would you do
Always a lie and never the truth
Now as for me, I'm movin on
You'll always be my baby

(Chorus 2: Ashanti)
Baby I just got to let you go for now
Thought I could take it for a while
Maybe you will make it back around

Baby I just got to live my life for now
Can't see me changin for a while
Hope I can make it back around

(Ashanti)
Anything that I want I can get it boy
you know you turn me on and on
that's why I switch my frame my mind
the been in there when you call always on time

I-I-I-I-I'm lookin to spread my wings
and party everything and for everybody
I need my space, my time alone
it's like our hearts don't match no more

I'm still everything that you want you can get it boy
You know I still got love for you
In court I'll plead the fifth, my baby

(Chorus 2)

(Ashanti)
When you was cheatin, you was probably thinkin
I won't sense a thing
But love got a funny way of catchin up to lies
and your lies can't look me straight in the eyes

I'm not surprise that you would hurt me baby
Though why me baby
Just let me breath in
I-I-I-I-I-I fly-y-y-y freely

(Chorus 1 and 2)

(Ja Rule)
yo, yo, 
Why in the world would you wanna leave me girl
Is there something that I did that you feel
that if it was here at home
then I know a bitch can do better on her own
You're not alone!
The way you hurt me baby
Shit, why me baby
I feel yo pain a little but I know that love is real
and as long as I let you go you feel
the need to come back to me baby
Who else gone hold you and sex you crazy
R-U-L-E come on back holla at me baby

(Chorus 2) 2x

(Chorus 1) </pre>
