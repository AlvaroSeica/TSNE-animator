Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Future man knows what to do, he's got a plan to help this land
He's the future man, he's the future man
Future lady's confident, she knows how to take a stand
She's the future lady, she's the future lady

Bright in the yellow sun, there's energy for everyone
Bright in the yellow sun, let it come, let it come
Bright in the yellow sun, there's energy for everyone
Bright in the yellow sun, let it come, let it come

Future man is taking steps, he ain't got no time to rest
He's the future man, the future man
Future lady's getting dressed, she's gonna clear up all this mess
She's the future lady, the future lady

The wind makes the windmill turn
The wind makes the world go round and round
The wind makes the windmill turn, let it blow, let it blow

The wind makes the windmill turn
The wind makes the world go round and round
The wind makes the windmill turn, let it blow, let it blow

Future man knows what to do, he's got a plan to help this land
He's the future man, the future man
Future lady's confident, she knows how to take a stand
She's the future lady, she's the future lady

Bright in the yellow sun, there's energy for everyone
Bright in the yellow sun, let it come, let it come
Bright in the yellow sun, there's energy for everyone
Bright in the yellow sun, let it come, let it come

The wind makes the windmill turn
The wind makes the world go round and round
The wind makes the windmill turn, let it blow, let it blow

The wind makes the windmill turn
Wind makes the world go round and round
Wind makes the windmill turn, let it blow, let it blow</pre>
