[Intro]
Twistin fingers in the club, I'm a young nigga
I got them young niggaz that'll hide your body parts
Pants saggin, flag hangin, I'm a young nigga
("P-Pants saggin, flag hangin, I'm a young nigga")

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
My pants saggin low like a young nigga
I'm twistin up the 'dro like a young nigga
I'm in the club thirty deep like a young nigga
I'm still in the streets like a young nigga
Like a young nigga, this one for the young niggaz
Where ya from nigga? This one for the young niggaz
For the young niggaz, this one for the young niggaz
Where ya from nigga? This one for the young niggaz

[Gucci Mane]
Yeah I watch my niggaz rob, they don't got a job
I got a couple young niggaz that'll take the charge
So I don't bring a bodyguard I bring my entourage
Stop the track pause - R.I.P. to Camoflauge
I am about to pull my yellow 'Rarri out the car garage
I got some young niggaz that'll hide your body parts

[Waka Flocka Flame]
Twistin fingers in the club, I'm a young nigga
Got them old niggaz sayin I love that young nigga
Your whole click buyin shots, y'all some broke niggaz
Pants saggin, flag hangin I'm a young nigga
In the car strapped up with them guns nigga
We shootin at the po-lice just for fun nigga

[Chorus]

[Waka Flocka Flame]
Ray Charles vision, screamin where's the competition?
Lot of rappers on the carton, man they swag missin
I'm on that young nigga shit
Shiesty ass niggaz at my shows run for bricks
Gucci said I'm goin hard, Flocka on this shit
Old school swag got these hoes on my dick
I'ma let 'em think I'm like "Which girl to get?"
Pulled up on some on-set yellow and black whip
I'm on my Wiz Khalifa shit, I don't do no papers
Fresh up off the papers, hater catch the vapors
Shoes alligator, I'm talkin 'bout Jordans
She ain't got enough swag, shorty can't afford 'em

[Chorus]</pre>
