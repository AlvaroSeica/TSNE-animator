Chorus: repeat 8X
[Pimp hard   ..   pimp harder]

(Eightball)
Big plush cadillac seats holding me up
Bitches hatin' cuz I'm always doing big boy stuff
Would will ill be grippin' in my big boy truck
Back then at the club gettin' this big boy sucked
Eightball, Mjg you know we can't be touched
If its bout hennessy and weed you can link it to us
If I feel you disrespectin' ima cock it and bust
And MJG gon be right with me if that eight ain't enough

(MJG)
If Eight ain't enough 
Don't worry I got eight in the clip
Eight for them hard looks
And eight for that lip
It was unnecessary
That sort of punishment was less than very ugly
Which was fucked up 
You wanted this you lucked up then
Oh well  some more shit I'm stuck up in 
Hey lets squash it  
Go sweep the dust up then 
Drink a shot 
I got a bitch you could drive a truck up in 
MJG pimp tight! And I got em

Chorus:  8X

(Eightball)
We handle this shit like a pimp should
I fuck with them niggaz who run the hood
From the south to the east coast to the west
I be puffin on that shit that gon be burnin' in yo chest
See them hoes want a nigga who got bread
These niggaz want a bitch you got that fire head
And all I want is weed and money
And mo' money
The streets don't respect a nigga   with no money

(MJG)
Ya poor dummy  
You should be spendin ya ho money
When she offered you some 
You probably tell her "no honey"
You to slow sonny
What I'm spittin' gon make you know somethin'
So the next time instead of just talking 
You could show something
And most hoes is like casinos 
Pistol blow somethin'
So anytime a bitch approach me 
I see some dope coming
My main focus is tricks who be out ho huntin'
But they don't get that pussy for free
I make em owe somethin'

Chorus: 8X

(Eightball)
I like them yellow dick women giving love to me
Hugs and kisses disrespecting bitches cuz of me
Always wanna sex with me no matter where we be
All her friends do my friends and they do it for free
Ok we smoke with them hoes and get em something to eat
But any real nigga will just to drill baby
Pimp hard or pimp harder for the millennium
That paper out here for ya ima get me some

(MJG)
Hit a liquid some
Tell my bitch to quick get the gun
We got some shit to run so shut up and cut off the grits they done
I want you up on your feet until they blitz the song
Bitch you understand what I'm sayin'
I'm the official one
Mjg I pimp strong until the reasons gone
Until it ain't no hojack left to spring the season on 
The niggaz who violated they still bleedin' on
I be packs and shit sacks and the leavings on

Chorus: 16X</pre>
