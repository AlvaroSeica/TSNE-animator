[Intro]
Heh yeah, ah yeah
Alright (alright) yeah

[ASAP Rocky]
Don't cry, dry your eyes, call me a jerk
Not cause the size of my jeans but how I hurt ya
I knew this relationship was never gon' work
But I plant thoughts in your head that only do you dirt
And I said this once befo', we make the perfect team
We barely get along, forever makin scenes
Your cryin on my sleeve, what does it really mean?
It doesn't really matter to me

[Chorus]
Cause I go, I go all around the world
Fuck different girls, cause when they see your boy they scream
And as sad as it seems, it doesn't really matter to me
Cause I know, I know there's a perfect girl
who I can share my soul with but I can only see in my dreams
And as sad as it seems, it doesn't really matter to me

[ASAP Rocky]
Now you can cry me a river, or cry me a ocean
Maybe the Pacific, that's just to be specific
I gotta keep it pimpin, these hoes they say I'm trippin
I don't care about your nails your new hairdo yo' lipstick
Dip dip next ho, they be on my dick like
all on my testicles, I can't even piss right
After we fuck you won't see me again after this night
Real niggaz know what I mean

[Chorus]

[ASAP Rocky]
Don't cry, dry your eyes, call me a jerk
Not cause the size of my jeans but how I hurt ya
I knew this relationship was never gon' work
But I plant thoughts in your head that only do you dirt
And I said this once befo', we make the perfect team
We barely get along, forever makin scenes
Your cryin on my sleeve, what does it really mean?
It doesn't really matter to me
Now you can go go where you want, front who the one gotta get that vibe
Girl I hit that quit that hotter hit that niggas knoz how I keep it live
Live try dis suprised but she just say I'm on her eyes
Whenever get it in that Prada or Gialacka en la casa
I be the man, Peter Pan, I fly high cause you like my drift
She know how I do it cause I got pizzaz and I'm so swift
Get her girlfriend, in this whirlwind, how we spin
It don't really matter cause I'm pimpin bitch until the end

[Chorus]</pre>
