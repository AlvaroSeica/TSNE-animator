She could be my, Queen to be, Vanessa Bell Calloway
Yin to my Yang on that one foot balance thang
Hair cut short goin thru her Halle phase
I can see her in my Palace with the Palisades
Forever Honeymooners in that Ralph &amp; Alice stage
Alpha Male in the Jungle trynna salvage Jane
But she don't need me and my valiant ways
Just a little recognition and her talents praised
Imagine if Heaven's a mile away
The closest thing to Helen Folasade
Adu I do? I'm trynna get married today
Black Ops yellin: Too soon! Carried away
I ain't even ask her what her name was yet
Already wondering if she trynna claim a husband
I think I need to just tone it down..
She got my thoughts racin' while I'm sippin on this crown, wow

CHORUS:
Say the Word and WE can Start
YOU can by my Queen of Hearts
I can See the Future
From Inside my Crystal Ball
Say the Word and WE can Start
YOU can by my Queen of Hearts
I can See that YOU and me
are just a Game of Cards

She out for Presidents to represent her
But, Dead that like Marylin. I make a chick from bougie to head wrap
And, I ain't talkin' bout Badu or Irie. I mean I make her feen Karrine Steffans for Press, ACTION
Not trynna make a Hoe a Baby Mama Drama, But, I do like some Crazy on my Lady
I got problems but I'm balanced
I'm guilty but acquitted, Orenthal. If it ain't a challenge, I ain't trynna kill it, won't call
Just don't walk up and UPS the digits
YOU might as well just threw em out the window
I don't pick up the litter
And, I probably won't like YOU if YOU cool with ALL my niggas Already, Go figure
But, yo figure make me wonder maybe..
YOU make flip heads to tails when that money-maker toss-up
Just hate when you through, butt-naked and YOU leave the stage
and Security walks up saying: Hey, Get Out The Way!

CHORUS:
Say the Word and WE can Start
YOU can by my Queen of Hearts
I can See the Future, From Inside my Crystal Ball
Say the Word and WE can Start
YOU can by my Queen of Hearts
I can See that YOU and me, are just a Pair of Cards

OUTRO CHORUS:
Say the Word Girl
YOU can be my Queen of..
Say the Word Girl
YOU can be my Queen of Hearts</pre>
