[Chorus: Jess Harlen] {X2}
Don't worry about nothin', cause nothin' works out
Hold onto somthin', till somethin' turns round

[Verse 1: Muph]
Heard you've been stressed out lately
Your friends are concerned for your safety
Talkin like your steel nerves are breakin
And walkin like you just murdered your patience
You drink bourbon on the daily
On a search for somewhere vacant
They just wanna nurture the pain and
Fade it, strain it and percolate it
I know it's not a personal statement
But your words reaffirm that you're fading
No longer firm and stern when you say it
My word, we can rework this arrangement

[Chorus] {X2}

[Verse 2: Muph]
And I've seen you... brush it off like it's nothing
Lips locked, it's not for discussion
Paracetamol in Muphin
It's my turn to see you leave the strugglin
The rope burn bleeds and bludgeons
You can't believe that you're nothin
You're the one thing that can ease the sufferin
It kept me going when secrets were sucked in
The hoover put a pressure on a loser
Sucked in - nah fuck him
He don't understand, he's just lonely man
Tryna get an upper hand

[Chorus] {X2}

[Jess Harlen]
Don't you, don't you, don't you, don't you
Worry about nothin', yeah
Don't worry about nothin', nothin' works out
Hold onto somethin', till somethin' turns round

[Verse 3: Muph]
Lift your feet up, put your foot down
Hold your head high, try not to look down
Take a deep breath, release and push out
Believe me, we all took routes
That could house the hopeless
Amongst the cloud, encountered the loneliness
Chase them clouds, adding to the openness
And he seems great, staying proudly devoted
Throughout the hours that we've spoken
I can see your self-esteem's broken
But I'm kinda relieved that you're honin
In on the problems, easier said and spoken
Open that mind, expose the insides
Little bit of ice, deal with burnt pride
We can change the flow and turn tides
Tread water, sure it's not the first time

[Jess Harlen]
Oh don't you worry about nothin', cause nothin' works out
Hold onto somethin' till somethin' turns around
Till somethin', till somethin', till somethin' turns around
Oh don't you worry, oh don't you worry
Oh don't you worry bout nothin' cause nothin' gonna work out
Hold on, hold on, hold onto somethin'
Hold on, hold onto somethin' till somethin' turns round</pre>
