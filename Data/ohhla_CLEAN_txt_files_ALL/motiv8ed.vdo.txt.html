Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro]
You're everything I want
I wanna give you what you need
Baby when I said I'll hand you the world I don't mean to gloat
Real talk I don't mean to glow
You're everything I want girl, I give you what you need
I was born to spend money
Girl we make the perfect team

[Verse 1]
Like the Boston Celtics
You can have it all, mine far from selfish
Sean Paul dance harder than Elvis harder than Elvis
You wishing on a star, I'm the star you end up with
Vado, man
You know how V do
Finish your bracelet, ice cubes and V2s
Boo you like that? Well me too
So tell the lady wrap up both, we need 2
Anything to make my sugar happy
She like you too young to be a sugar daddy
Condo classy, you could let er in
Minus the C you could see me in every letter bin
Nuff cheddar spent, that's what I really do
Had plenty boo's but none of them as pretty as you (nah)
But we could cruise through the city too

[Chorus]
Whatever you want (whatever), whatever you need (I got it)
You get me motivated to give it to you baby
I'm tired of playing games (real talk)
I want to treat you like a queen (gorgeous)
Whatever it takes to keep you motivated (I got you baby)

[Verse 2]
Wutchu wanna sip? White wine or nectar?
Eyes like Electra, I'm a dime collector
Sex of the wall like a projector
Loft down in Tribecca, now they gotta respect ya
No more shoppin at C Town
Lead out every night, for Mr. Chowder Felipe's now
Love is blind but I see now
Soon as you call I answer, no need to redial
Ain't even had no dream yet
Giuseppe high heels, Alexander McQueen dress
Dress flyer than golf stream jets
Shoot a cross just to catch a play we ain't seen yet
(Vado) I do the damn thing
Trust me like Pepsi, I'm a brand name
Must be impressed driving your man's Range
No loan, I get you your own and champagne
Do the damn thing

[Chorus]
Whatever you want (it's nothin), whatever you need
You get me motivated to give it to you baby
I'm tired of playing games (you already know)
I want to treat you like a queen (it's my wife right there)
Whatever it takes to keep you motivated

[Verse 3]
Why cuff ya? No need to rush ya
Street hustla, guaranteed to touch ya
SL6 to pick up her
She like what the? Soon as the seats hugged er
I show you how to ball playa
Risk residence, we live around ball playas
White planes, no ice chain, that's light change
We like things, there's nothing out of our price range

[Interlude]
There's a combination to your heart
You to the left, me to the right
Love in the middle, girl
And what we've built together
Let nobody tear it apart
That's why I do for you girl

[Chorus: x2]
Whatever you want, whatever you need
You get me motivated to give it to you baby
I'm tired of playing games
I want to treat you like a queen
Whatever it takes to keep you motivated

Motivated, motivated
