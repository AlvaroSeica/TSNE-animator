(Let off a couple) --&gt; Psycho Les

[ A.L. ]
I'm into stackin papers, I'm smackin fakers if they rappin haters
I'm jackin bakers takin dough plus I'm crackin acres
My throughts are intricate, magnificient, significant
Infinite spittin it on behalf of those are innocent
My tongue's a instrument, makin my larynx a clarinet
Never to fumble or stumble, stayin away from arrogance
The mic's a sacrament, I bring to life while you surrogate
Lyrics are holy, I write this poetry in arabics
So let's get head up, dead up, step up and you get wet up
Up in a set up, you bleed for real, forget the ketchup
And you can tell I'm proper, rap the planet while you sellin copper
You cross my path I have you hangin from a helicopter
Step in my world but I ain't down with hittin Blondie
Livin with zombies got me starvin hungry like if I was Ghandi
You try to set it, yo, I regret it, I'm fly poetic
You die pathetic cause you sweeter than a diabetic
Lyric historian, crown valet victorian
Rap in memoriam, been doin it since the auditorium
Visionary, missionary, you get the picture scary
Squish you like berries, have your name in the obituary

[ Psycho Les ]
We got no feelings for ya
We're breakin hearts, choppin breaks apart
Technically we grab you with the state of art
Let it start, pause your camcorder
I fear we slam harder with this lyrical manslaughter

[ JuJu ]
Hey yo, I stay hustlin, bustin, I'm disgustin
Only got a few friends and I don't even trust them
Those cats who wanna see power I'm gonna crush em
Affiliated, got all the work flowin through custom
Frankly, better make your mark and enforce it
Look at me, the end of my sleeves remain frosted
I lost it, took the ball and ran when they tossed it
Blind shit, not even care how much it costed

[ Rawcotiks ]
( ? ) undercover and judges, druggin is rugged
Jailtime walks in expensive halls
Fast calls, killers and mad weight for high stakes
Snitches behind gates will become shark bait
Train pitch, you on my hit list, public enemy, different identity
A chameleon towards civiliance
Warfare political government affairs
A madman who declares a share
A piece of the action, a percent, yo, you gotta pay rent
Or catch dent and facial gat imprints
Man, even our se√±oritas be carryin heaters
Now how you gon' beat us or delete us
You bunch of half-way achievers
By ( ? ) appartment leases the dough increases
Out of this world contact just like ( ? )
See, we keep pieces strapped on the waistline
But too many jokers in the world of crime so now I keep mine
And the sh... never mind, forget that
Don't even sweat that
Let me get upon this track and let the world relax</pre>
