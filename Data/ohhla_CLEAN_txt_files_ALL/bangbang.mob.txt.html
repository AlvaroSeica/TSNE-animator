(Intro, Master P)
I put my trust in God, I don't put my trust in man
Niggas'll lie, steal, kill ya
Do whatever, know what I'm sayin?
This my movie, I'm the director
I know I might tell y'all somethin and y'all might listen to this shit but mayn...
That mothafuckin Calliope project ain't nothin to play with
From my hood to your hood, real shit my nigga

(Verse 1, Master P)
I'm in the project, got two guaps
Y'all niggas run up on me talkin that woo-wop
My nigga on the ground layin in a puddle of blood
Next day nigga layin in a puddle of mud
I don't gamble but a nigga gotta take a chance
Mask up under the house, nigga hit the gas
Dirty game, bang-bang; Niggas don't play
I'm from the hood, niggas die every other day
Murder shit mothafucka, ain't no politics
I'm from the streets where young niggas, they'll kill ya quick
And if you trappin mothafuckas, they'll fuck your bitch
Kill ya boy and ride wit'cha lookin for the shit
Dirty game, mothafuckas like to bang-bang
I'm from the streets where niggas let they nuts hang
Don't change, mothafucka niggas gang bang
Lil niggas run around like Superman

(Hook, Master P)
Bang-bang! Motherfuck a nigga! Bang-bang!
From the hood where niggas sell dope and gang bang!
Bang-bang! Motherfuck a nigga! Bang-bang!
From the hood where niggas sell dope and gang bang!
Bang-bang! Motherfuck a nigga! Bang-bang!
From the hood where niggas sell dope and gang bang!
Bang-bang! Motherfuck a nigga! Bang-bang!
From the hood where niggas sell dope and gang bang!

(Verse 2, Fat Trel)
Bang-bang, motherfuck a nigga, bang-bang
Robbin bitches, killin niggas ain't the same thang
I want your bitch, I want your presidents, I want your chain
I want your whip, I want your shoes; I'm a rude dude
I think polices know my name, come from cocaine
Hella funds, so you know my guns bang-bang
What's your name? Where you hang?
Heard you whip a Range
I got a fifty shot bang, I ain't gotta aim
We not the same, D.C.; Kill anything
Or anybody, I'll drop a body with any shotty
Somebody stop him, they try to tell me the Feds watchin
But I'm the same, and all I know is bang-bang-bang-bang

(Hook, Master P)
Bang-bang! Motherfuck a nigga! Bang-bang!
From the hood where niggas sell dope and gang bang!
Bang-bang! Motherfuck a nigga! Bang-bang!
From the hood where niggas sell dope and gang bang!
Bang-bang! Motherfuck a nigga! Bang-bang!
From the hood where niggas sell dope and gang bang!
Bang-bang! Motherfuck a nigga! Bang-bang!
From the hood where niggas sell dope and gang bang!

(Verse 3, Alley Boy)
Murder cheap in my city
Youngins killin for pennies
Two bands'll get ya topped
Bang-bang, bodies dropped
Alley Boy, he goin major
See these shots on front pages
Young niggas doing walk ups
No pull ups, hit ya from all angles
These niggas ain't really street
These niggas ain't ran no traps
Where I'm from get ya murked asap
Bang-bang-bang, put ya head in ya lap
Alley boy, big P, Fat Trel
Stay alive off cocaine sales
Know they laced up, keep my shells
These rap niggas, they fake as hell
Niggas lying in lyrics
Real niggas don't wanna hear it
Anything in the streets, I did it
We gon' see who really wit it
Fuckboy better stay in your lane
When that chopper sangs, you can get a whole thang
Know I love that gun sound; Bang-bang-bang-bang

(Hook, Master P)
Bang-bang! Motherfuck a nigga! Bang-bang!
From the hood where niggas sell dope and gang bang!
Bang-bang! Motherfuck a nigga! Bang-bang!
From the hood where niggas sell dope and gang bang!
Bang-bang! Motherfuck a nigga! Bang-bang!
From the hood where niggas sell dope and gang bang!
Bang-bang! Motherfuck a nigga! Bang-bang!
From the hood where niggas sell dope and gang bang!</pre>
