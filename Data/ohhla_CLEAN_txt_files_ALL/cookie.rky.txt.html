Typed by: AZ Lyrics

(Let's wake up?) it's dinner time
Turn up
Pull up to the crib and a nigga on [?]
Come fuck with a nigga
Bang on a pussy like I'm on a [?]
Fuck with a nigga
You gon' wanna come claim this dick
Fuck with a nigga

Ohh, she roller coasted on it (ohh)
She threw it up an alley (oop)
Gonna beat the pussy til its (blue)
Girl you know I got that good yeah

Like an Oreo
I love to lick the middle like an Oreo (turn up)
Oreo, Oreo, like an Oreo
I wanna bite it, and get inside it til I get you gone
Wanna know how I get down?
Wanna know how I get down?
You wonder how I'm the best and how I can do all this with my mouth?
Wanna know how I get down?
Wanna know how I get down?
You wonder how I'm the best and how I can do all this with my mouth?

Cookie, cookie, cookie, I'm a cookie monster
Break your back, crack it open like a lobster

Ayyy, I kill the pussy, dig a (grave)
She grab the wood like grippin (grain)
I told her put it in my face, let it rain (rain)

Like an Oreo
I love to lick the middle like an Oreo (turn up)
Oreo, Oreo, like an Oreo
I wanna bite it, and get inside it til I get you gone

Girl I've got a sweet tooth
Ain't nothin' sweeter than you
I'mma eat it up, beat it up, til you holler out truce
My bed can be your stage, and I'mma make you a star
Your legs in the air and my hand all up in your cookie jar
Yeah I'm hittin' the spot on your map, thats me going on tour
My Tom Ford your [?]
You throwin' ass, I'm catchin' it
The neighbors keepin' score
Louie Armstrong, I pick you up, eat that against the door

Mmmm
Like an Oreo
I love to lick the middle like an Oreo (turn up)
Oreo, Oreo, like an Oreo
I wanna bite it, and get inside it til I get you gone
Wanna know how I get down?
Wanna know how I get down?
You wonder how I'm the best and how I can do all this with my mouth?
Wanna know how I get down?
Wanna know how I get down?
You wonder how I'm the best and how I can do all this with my mouth?
