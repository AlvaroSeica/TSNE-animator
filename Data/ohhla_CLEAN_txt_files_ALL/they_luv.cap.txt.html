[Cap.One]
Uh, yeah, uh yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah uh

My Chi town playas
(They luv dat, they luv dat)
Philly and DC
(They luv dat, they luv dat)
Atlanta, Miami, LA
(They luv dat, they luv dat)
(Atlanta, Miami, LA)
Memphis and Texas, The Bay
(Uh Texas, The Bay uh)
North and South Carolina
(They luv dat, they luv dat)
Virginia and them Big Tymers
(They luv dat, they luv dat)
MI, Vegas, Jersey behind ya
(They luv dat, they luv dat)
Detroit, Orlando that's where you can find us!
YEAH!

First of all where my big cats
Who sit back and pop Cris
By the six pack sittin' on big stacks
Like dig that
They call me strobe light
Cause of the way my ice shine when I hold mics
Nigga get your dough right
Spit rhymes for bitches they luv dat
Then flip it gutta for muthafuckas
Where my thugs at?
Catch me on the block all night
Flippin' drug backs
Hataz don't honor want drama
Then we lettin' slugs clap
For the love of the niggas and bitches
Who a run up in the spot with the gun cocked and hit niggas
Lookin' for the Windy City watchers
Y'all don't want none with the prophet
Windy City Mobsters we fixin' to prosper
Hittin' opposition with a mini mack clip
And dippin' in the Benz that was flickin'
That's how we ride on a mission
See I spit that shit for my killas
On the block duckin' the cops
We bout Scrilla!
It's South Side till the day I die
We gorillas!
Its M-Five nigga that's the tribe we the realer

1 - [Cap.One]
    Check when you see me flickin' up the block
    (They luv dat)
    Hat cocked, checkin' my watch yo
    (They luv dat)
    Beats bangin, droppin' the top
    (They luv dat)
    Iced out flossin' my rocks
    You know they luv dat
    When you see off in the club
    (They luv dat)
    One Blunt rolling on dubs
    (They luv dat)
    When I show 'em nothin' but love
    (They luv dat)
    VIP nothin' but thugs
    (They luv dat)

[Nokio]
I see you're sick playa
Cause I rock jewels for the rush I get
Dru Hill platinum dragons custom shit
Chain truck, chipped up make you tuck your shit
One night all it take and I'll cut your chick
You see the rings that I'm rockin', the bracelet
Rolley ice, tough shinin' like the face was lit
see fuck y'all haters I run up in your face and spit
We used to have to wait in line and now we GANGSTA shit
And niggas love that shit
When the playas be minked up, six chicks linked up
Dough by the gray trucks
Spend cash for y'all
Grab ass for y'all
Six cases of Cris when we pass the bar
nigga I'm N-O-K-I-O
Spit it for my niggas and bitches that got dough

They luv dat
Shut it down playa every show
Rollin' with the don, Cap One watch it blow
How they luv dat!

[Repeat 1]

[Cap.One]
Yo reminiscing when I beat box and pop blocks
But now I cop cops and run up in rock spots
Duck when the block cock
Fuck fag niggas I bust the mack split ya
Grill to the wife mean she cop the Jag
Flick up the block then cop her squat
Let beats bang while y'all chickens pop that cock
Move that thang shorty frontin' like you got something for me
(Got something for me uh)
Never ever give a tip unless she cuttin' my homie
(Unless she cuttin' my homie)
I'm pimpin' your Rolley and see it with your eyes
Plus I'm just living the life
Windy city ballers, city in Chi
Right-handed villains and we ready to ride
Keep your head in the five
Live like a big dog at the club with the dick grown
Hat cocked eyes all up on the girl with the big shorts
Now tell me what the info
Now you live that shit when a nigga be ballin'
Hit up his block and bump for eight blocks
Windows cracked sippin' on Yack
Now who the mack?
C-A-P dot and keep a Dre-A cocked
I'm sponsored by the macks in the hood
A matter of fact I'm still backed by the hood
So what y'all wanna act
Then it's good we can take it to the stage
If we gotta bring it back to the woods
Now you see?

[Repeat 1 until the end]</pre>
