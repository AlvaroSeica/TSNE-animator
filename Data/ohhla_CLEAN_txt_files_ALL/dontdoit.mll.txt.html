Typed by: AZ Lyrics


[Sean Kingston]
These hose are triflin
Thats why we ain't gon wife em
These young niggas better smart up
And dont get caught up
Said shawty got a husband
But she out here creepin
These young niggas better smart up
And dont get caught up

Dont do it, noooo
Dont do it, noooo
Dont do it,
Just cause she fine with ass
But she just want a nigga with cash
She triflin

[Meek Mill]
Shawty got a man, but she creepin though
I guess she want a young nigga eatin though
But I was never known to keep a hoe
Met her in mia, was with my nigga Tre a week ago
A friend told me he had two weeks before
She said she ain't fuck in months, Im like you sneaky hoe
But I knew some bitches like my sneakers though
Fucking all my homies she was tryna keep a secret though
Loving the crew, love the place for the team
She sucking my dick, guess we chasing her dream
Im made her go ham, he made her a queen
I ain't chasing these hoes, no nigga Im chasing this cream

[Sean Kingston - Chorus]

[Nipsey Hussle]
She look good, but to me she just a bummy bitch
Tryna fall in love cause she know Im bumpy rich
Hear my name ringing, she know Im on my tip
She cant walk out her house without hearing em play my shit
2008 came in this game and I ain't made a grip
Im sucking, ducking, fucking with the ones I made it with
One thing they knew about Nip Hussle I dont save a bitch
She be content with saying, she done fucked a famous crip
Basic bitches that we flippin, you be laying with
Her pussy played out, we call that Avirex
OBGYN, she got you in labour with
Your maybe baby cause you weak and be chasing yo dick nigga

[Chorus]</pre>
