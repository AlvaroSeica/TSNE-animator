[Intro: Daddy Rose, (Suga Bang Bang)]
Yeeeah.. Heaven and Earth shit
Forty days and forty nights (one love..)
We murder all day (one love.. one life)
Murder all night, can you feel my pain?
(One love.. one life.. to live)
U.K., can you feeel my pain?
(One life to live..)

[Daddy Rose]
The ressurected Christ just rose from the Hell's flame
Where I'm from we murder all day and we sell 'caine
Been so miserable so long I could smell pain
Didn't know shorty's body was on the roof until the smell came
Coward niggaz snitchin, and can't spell names
Workin with the D's, shit and they sell names
Besides the monkey, I got my baby mamas on my back
Sometimes I be wonderin if these bitches wacked
Can you feel me? Been through changes in my life, but I'm still me
Men who come in the name of God shifty and wanna kill me
But I'm surrounded by thug love, no one to still beat
Just my precious stole shit, 'ever will be
I roamed the Earth, I was crowned with bloody thorns
Upon my birth, I'ma give all I can give
Shit, never live negative, although you've got one life to live

[Suga Bang Bang]
One love.. one life.. one life.. to live
One love.. one life..

[ShaCronz]
It's gettin hotter..
Though the muggy weather me never stop, born to use clever plots
Strive for cheddar, we young, could bet a Scotch
Clouds fall like rain, I watch the poor in pain
I speak for those lookin for a change
In front of corner stores, sippin Cors' with a dame
You know the law, extorted to reign, in my new drug
Chickens adore my chain, almost died 'til I realized I had more to gain
Winter time, snow falls, the old brawl
Hustlin in cold halls, strugglin sometimes feel like death
Learn to deal with the stress, kill with the best
Forced to tote steel with a vest
In dreams we attack the world, abandoned buildings
Smoke hash and hurl, want cash, won't hesitate to clap your girl
Test my manhood, me and my man stood
back to back, gat to gat, stack for stack
Cake it up, put it on the plate, then break it up
God of the universe, police will never take me cuffed
God of the universe, police will never take me cuffed
What? What? You know?

[Suga Bang Bang]
One love.. one life.. one life.. to live
One love.. one life..

[I-Born]
From birth we cursed, this life hurts, these floors burst
The first one swingin, who bring it?
The spit singin, the bitch thing, from graveyard
We semen, the dark hearts is measured on triple beam
Ripple dreams, get crippled for C.R.E.A.M.
The biscuits clean, fake thugs gleam
Locked, I squeeze, Fort Greene off top
Take it all and empty, cheap frauds
Street laws, my drink speak pause
All alley case, sick Sally snakes
Hustle for Cali grapes, our style is faced
Only cuz they crown can't wait
You damn straight, envy, leave me the papes
with trey-eights, keep the theives at bate
The boxcutter way, Billy (Lust peace.. I must leak)

[Suga Bang Bang]
One love.. one life.. one life.. to live
One love.. one life.. liiiiiife
One love.. one life.. one life.. to live
One love.. one life..</pre>
