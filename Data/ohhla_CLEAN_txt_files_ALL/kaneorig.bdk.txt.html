[ VERSE 1 ]
The wrath of Kane, takin over your circumfrence
Destroyin negativity, and suckers that come with
The weak, the wack, the words, the poor
I thrash, bash, clash, mash (* Mister Cee scratch *) and then more
Blow up the scenery, I reign supremer, see
You need a savior to save ya, so lean on me
I'm playin rappers like a haunted ghost
And stomp em out like a wanted roach
I slay my prey and they decay
I blow away and throw away
So go away, cause I don't play
Attackin like a psychopath 
Breakin rappers in half
So feel the wrath
Of Kane!

[ VERSE 2 ]
The man at hand, to rule and school and teach
And reach the blind to find their way from A to Z
And be the most, and boast the loud and proud
The Kane'll reign your domain!  (YEAH KANE!)
The heat is on, so feel the fire
Come off the empire, on a more higher
Level than 'def', one step beyond 'dope'
The suckers all scope and hope to cope - but NOPE
Cause I can never let em on top of me
I play em out like a game of Monopoly
Let us beat around the ball like an Astro
Then send em to jail for tryin to pass Go
Shakin em up, breakin em up, takin no stuff
But it still ain't loud enough
So Mister Cee, let the volume grow
So I can flow - now yo
Juice Crew's the family, Slick Rick's a friend of me
And Doug E. Fresh, Stet', KRS and Public Enemy
Blahse Blah, you know who you are
The red, black and green, the sun, moon and star
Knowledge of Self is bein taught here on after
Peace in the name of I Self Lord and Master
I come to teach and preach and reach each
With the speech every leech I'll impeach
Drop science and build with math
And the dumb, deaf and blind'll feel the wrath
Of Kane!

Marley Marl, break it down!

Bring it back, Cee

[ VERSE 3 ]
Line by line, chapter after chapter
Like a pimp on the street, I gotta rap to
Those who chose to oppose, friend or foes 
I still dispose, and blow em out like afros
So many rappers have fronted to get a name out
Yellin and screamin and dreamin but still came out
Off the wall and butter softer, y'all
So you waited for Kane, to come forth to all
Competition, that bite and chew and crunch and munch
To play me out position, you on a mission
But stop lyin and tryin to front adventures
Your rhymes are more false than dentures
Freeze, as I get warm like a heater
You bite like a mosquito, but still can't complete a
Rhyme or find the time to design a line
Or phrase that pays, so you dine on mine
And steady frontin and tryin to be a friend of
You mgiht as well see _Guess Who's Coming To Dinner?_
So just quit, submit and forget
Huh, you must be on some new improved shit!
I get busy from sun to sun
I'm only 21 and untouched by anyone
No one throws bangs or blows
All foes, I keep em runnin like pantyhose
They get soft and tender, front and they'll surrender
I turned off more lights than Teddy Pender-
grass, bring on your class, forced be my staff
But when I'm in effect, they feel the wrath
Of Kane!
