Song:   See Me
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro]
Chris Webby, Googie GoHard
They still can't see us though
Regardless
Okay

[Chorus]
We the illest around, and ain't nobody gon' see me
Ain't nobody gon' see me, ain't nobody gon' see me
Burn this bitch to the ground, 'cause ain't nobody gon' see me
Ain't nobody gon' see me, ain't nobody gon' see me

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
You couldn't see me with your contacts in
Walk by, bitches yelling out like 'Oh My God' that's him
Mwahaha, so come here you little groupie
That's why I'm always chillin' with a burb like Snoopy
I got my wood stocked, I am rappin' cooked rock
Spitting crack, bring it back, doing things you could not
Burn a bag of good pot, let it lean, let it rock
CT, where you at, got my regional locked
Beam me up, Spock, to the top of this
Can't see me, see a fuckin' optometrist
I show dominance, you better grab bifocals
Then you see me kill it with the vocals, local
Hometown hero got the whole town buzzing
Like a vibrator, haters see you later, no discussion
Got percussion in my bloodline, music in my heartbeat
Money in my mind
Steve Nash couldn't guard me, hardly
Famous, well maybe on Facebook
Friend request healthy ass every single day, look
Rap's Dane Cook, one liner got 'em shook
Fly, a Peter Pan man, but I'm a captain like Hook
Rap and I took everything that is around you
Leave 'em looking like a damn Velicoraptor found you
Simply, sickly, somebody hit me
So cool I'm frozen in time like Walt Disney
Drink like I'm dizzy, and steadily burning
Anybody dumb enough to battle Webby will learn
That they can step in and step out, meeting adjourned
Ask Rafeki he'll tell you that the king has returned

[Chorus]
We the illest around, and ain't nobody gon' see me
Ain't nobody gon' see me, ain't nobody gon' see me
Burn this bitch to the ground, 'cause ain't nobody gon' see me
Ain't nobody gon' see me, ain't nobody gon' see me

[Verse 2: Googie GoHard]
It's Googie GoHard and I came to bless the track
Groovin' with the Teenage Mutant Ninja Rapper
We droppin' who can not, seeing Inglorious Bastards
The flow has been mastered, I'll leave it and spin it backwards
You don't want the raw meat, you don't want the raw eat
You don't wanna spark too many punches in the rap
You ain't on my level anyway, you spelling that
It's a tad in the bag from the git to the gat
Ah man, this kid is unbelievable
Even B.I.G. would say it's something he ain't seen before
He would blow, speaking shows, scheming when I'm even low
I ain't tryna battle homie, I just tryna see the dough
Nah, it ain't, seen it yo, faded just a little bit
Hope you got binoculars, and if you do riddle me this
How you gon' say something that you know yourself don't even exist
Lickety Split, [?]
Can't see, Webby, yo, Googie GoHard
You can't see us, how you gon' see far
So mean in my B-Boy lean
You gon' need a telescope to see these stars gleam
CT all the way to the dirty
Jersey, muhfucka, you heard me
We burn trees like arsonist, you don't wanna bark to this
Can't see the flow then you better get your goggles bitch

[Chorus]
We the illest around, and ain't nobody gon' see me
Ain't nobody gon' see me, ain't nobody gon' see me
Burn this bitch to the ground, 'cause ain't nobody gon' see me
Ain't nobody gon' see me, ain't nobody gon' see me</pre>
