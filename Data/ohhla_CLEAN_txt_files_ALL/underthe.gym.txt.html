[Intro]
From up above the clouds, to under the bridge
I'll always have a best friend in the city I live

[Travie McCoy]
Sometimes I feel, I don't have a partner
Sometimes I feel, like my only friend
is the city I live in, this big Rotten Apple
As lonely as I am, together we cry

I drive on her streets cause, she's my companion
I walk through her hills, cause she knows who I am
She sees my good deeds and, she kisses me windy
Now I never worry, now that is a lie

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
I don't ever wanna - feel, like I did that day
Take me to the place I love, take me all the way

[Travie McCoy]
It's hard to believe that, there's nobody out there
It's hard to believe, that I'm all alone
At least I have her love, the city she loves me
Lonely as I am, together we cry

[Chorus]

[Travie McCoy]
Oh noooooo, yeah yeah
Oh noooooo, no yeah yeah
Oh noooooo, no-no yeah yeah...

From the, highest of high to the lowest of low
From the, hottest of hot to the coldest of cold
From the day we pop out to the day we grow old
From the four-track hits to over ten million sold
From the, poorest of poor to the richest of rich
Already told your ass before that simple living's a bitch (biatch)
From above the clouds to under the bridge
I'll always have a best friend in the city I live

The bridge is over, the bridge is over
{*repeat skatting like KRS-One*}

Oh noooooo, yeah yeah
Oh noooooo, no yeah yeah
Oh noooooo, no-no yeah yeah... {*fades*}</pre>
