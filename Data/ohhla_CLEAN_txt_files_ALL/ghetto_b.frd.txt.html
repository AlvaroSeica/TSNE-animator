Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus: x3]
I grew up around them ghetto boys

[Verse 1]
I was raised by my mama
Then I was raised by niggas who raised the lama
Gauge in a leather bomber, we engaging drama
Death is coming, eat you alive, this Jeffrey Dama
They wanted me to finish the board of education
I dropped out, I was bored of education
Money caught my interest, slinging on the benches
Papi gave me peer, I'm giving customers that vintage
My men got sisters, they gave em a half a dozen
The Ave out here buggin with magnums they out here slugging
I'm out here hoodied up, champion of pony top
Picture while the corner pop, I'm out here with you on the block
I'm watching the transaction,
We breaking down every kilogram, gram stacking
I thank God they letting my people go
Welcome home all

[Chorus: x5]
I grew up around them ghetto boys

[Verse 2]
I grew up in the ghetto so from the get go
You know we had to get dough
Shots rain, get low
My uncle just wasn't quick enough
It was spring of april, that's when they hit him up
He was throwing up blood on my shirt
I had to snob staring at his hurts
Just got taken for what it's worth
I grew up around killers
The block was a casino, I grew up around dealers
You know why street niggas think different
You know these clips will make you jump niggas think griffin
The 50 is in the whip, that's how we grippin
Lord knows for the bullshit, this Scotty Pimpin
We still in the cut slinging
And we got it for the load, this is my upbringing
They letting my people go, thank God
Welcome home bra

[Chorus: x4]
I grew up around them ghetto boys</pre>
