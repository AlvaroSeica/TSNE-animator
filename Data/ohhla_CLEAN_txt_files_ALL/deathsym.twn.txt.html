[June Marx]
Gothic Symphony, demonic ministry
Lawless logic, symbolic in the imagery
Silent soliloquy,cosmic chemistry
Conjure it vividly, they copy and mimic me
Knowledge of symmetry,conscience spirit free
History laced with masonic conspiracy
Godless industry, pagans led them all astray 
They all decay, ancient to the modern day
Let the organs play, let the choir sing
Seance in the middle of a fire ring
Kill a tyrant king, take the bastard place
Masked my face, dash from volcanic base
Savage traits and tribal design,
Divine, transcend the seven cycles of time
Refine, its vital cause the flesh sinful
Detrimenal, represented by the death symbol

[Lone Ninja]
The thorn of death falls from the heavens
You mourned and wept and called on the reverend				
Slaughter your brethren as you stood defenseless
Draw for the weapon masked with hood, relentless				
Bad and just demented assassin is swift
Master of the henchmen you cash in your chips					
Abandon the ship and you'll sleep with the fishes
It's black in the ditch my mystique is the mystics				
They say the last rites they play the bag pipes
In hades' grasp the grave is vast, on way to after life 		
There's anger inside the dungeon
You answered the final summons					
Test me the harsh savage
Death be the dark passage					
On path to the glory you rose but fell short
Massacre's gory, you rode the pale horse</pre>
