[Verse 1: Jay Electronica]
I can't sleep at night, I toss and turn
Visions of my dead father, hoppin' out the urn
King James, Sigmund Freud, Mussolini, Nietzsche
If they miss me on the CD, they gonna get me through the TV
I'm sleeping and I'm dreaming, walking through the city streets
Hoping they don't see me, who?
Him right there with hands like a tiger, eyeballs of fire
Teeth like barbwire, feet like tires
He opened up his mouth and then out came the locusts
Real hocus pocus trying to make me lose focus
I can't wake up plus I couldn't run fast enough to make it to the truck
So I yell... but no sound came out
Teacher held me down, while the jackals ate my brain out
Then I woke (phew) close call
Stumbled to the bathroom, pissed all over the wall
Twisted up a nug, sippin' on Jack Daniels, watching True Blood
Sookie was gonna getta smashed by Eric and Bill
And out the corner of my eye, I thought I saw a few
The power went dead and on the beam of light
A ship carried me away at the speed of light
I said: please don't drop me, I'm scared to fall
Just another close call, the writing on the wall

[Chorus: Jay Electronica]
Am I conscious or dreaming
Peep or Tom Hanks, Angels and Demons
Dear Lord if I die tonight
Then I'm looking for revenge
Once I step into the light
[Repeat]

[Verse 2: Jay Electronica]
Fuck you Times Square, I'm losing my mind
Ice on my nutsack, trying to freeze time
Starbucks, Adderall, Nodoz, Hobos
The late Richard Simmons and a couple of limes
Blame Netflix, cousin of death was on the guestlist
Robots and Goldwatchers all over the setlist
Yes sir, Decon kills rats
I'm running with my wolf pack like Wolfman Jack
Crop circles under my eyes
Am I coming or am I going on this mushroom high
I can't lie, feel good to be me
Feel good to be free, feel good to be in 3D on MTV
Knock, knock, who is there?
Pop, slip down the rabbit hole
Back to another unending match of Scattergories (Uhh)
Snap out of it man because you got to save face for the politics and...</pre>
