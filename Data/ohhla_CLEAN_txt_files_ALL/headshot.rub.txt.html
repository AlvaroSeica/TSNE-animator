[Rubbabandz]
Bandz hold it down like a muthafucka
I got bitches holding guns and they will touch ya
Trust me, I'm a nigga with a hood degree
Stapleton Projects, straight N.Y.C.
I'm certified, you don't want no problem with me
I got heat, burn niggas to the tenth degree
This my hood, get caught slipping out here
You can get your top popped off round here
Can't stand homo crib
Fake ass pimp nigga wit a perm in his hair
Low blow, that's right I don't fight fair
And I don't pull out guns and shoot up in the air
I toke headshots to make ya body rock
You get touched then call the cops
Fake ass thug nigga, taking the stand
Acting like we tight, we ain't really mans
Brought some Brooklyn niggas to my mom's house, trynna get me murked out
And you supposed to be my right hand?
The type of nigga won't do shit to his enemy
A killa's best friend, and he supposed to be kinning me
You got to be kidding me, nigga you a bitch
A fake blood nigga, turned crip, turned snitch
Bring that shit, I don't care who you get
Put a price on my head, and I still won't get hit</pre>
