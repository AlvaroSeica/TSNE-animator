Uh-huh, uh-huh
(Lay it on me)
We been eatin, breathin, and sleepin hip hop since way back
When shoelaces were fat and Michael Jackson was black
So when we hook up a track and attack like Red Sonja
We're gonna lay it on ya {We're gonna lay it on ya}
As I drop the snap caps with the laugh gas, get a gas mask
Or you'll take your last gasps, so you better act fast
Once I place it into circulation there's no stoppin it
Cause every action has a reaction equal and opposite
Einstein get on the Vestax, keep the (keep the) beat (beat)
Steady when you're movin the wax
I come off so fast that they call me Velcro
I'll bend a pretender like my elbow, from his beanie to shell toe
And render this pretender and his rappin to be null and void
Compound his pressure points and snap him like a Polaroid [Say cheese!]
I open eyes wide without ammonia
Hittin harder than high tide when I lay it on ya

We lay it on ya
"Don't let the fools get you down and..."
"Maximum capacity, the projects jump."
We lay it on ya
"Maximum capacity, the projects jump."

Dizzy Dustin!

(Lay it on me)
I settle in my skeleton like Jell-o in the gelatin
In comparison, start and end with the melanin
In my skin, and again, this is Dizzy Dustin
{Blowin it up,} so reverse the liposuction
I'm chocolat-e, been on more missions than a padre
On Pace like picante to saute a chupacabre
I stay hungry, like Al Bundy
or kids who forgot their lunch money
Got a propellant to propel and repellent to repel
The excellent excel and the rest test and fail
So I keep my eyes clean, without the Visine
And don't ignore the hygiene like Dave the dope fiend
My mics a gyroscope
And Young Einstein got a dookie gold rope
I flow without lamaze, break it down like pneumonia
And I never pause when I start to lay it on ya

We lay it on ya
"Don't let the fools get you down and..."
"Maximum capacity, the projects jump."
We lay it on ya
"Maximum capacity, the projects jump."

[Andy Cooper and Dizzy Dustin]
(Lay it on me)
When we rock a show all the heads they know
That we exercise good mic control
I stay stable like a neutron, it's on like a crouton
From here to the Yukon (the Yukon)
Man, I do an interplanetary tour, crusin in my battlestar
Leave Â‘em wantin more like a sumo at a salad bar
A U with a G, add a L and a Y, and then a Duckling
You can't deny we lay it on ya

We lay it on ya
"For those of you who love to hip hop"
We lay it on ya
"We rock, the best of 'em"</pre>
