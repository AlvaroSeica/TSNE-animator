[Intro: 12 O'Clock]
Yeah I wanna date you, huh Missy?
Can I date you, date you?
Can I go out on a date with you?
Can I spoil you? Feed you?
Can I go out on a date with you?

[Chorus: Preacherman]
If you wanna party with the Zu ma
Let's get this party started
Drunk up in the VIP ma
Let's get this party started
Back that thing against the wall now
Bend down and touch the floor
Whoa, never seen a thing shaped like that ma
Bend down and touch ya toes

[12 O'Clock]
Hey sexy, see ya smell so sweet
And them thongs you wear shows ya ass cheek
You in the club like a freak, and ya job is police
So won't you drop it down and touch ya feet?
Let's pop some bottles, the kind that burn when you swallow
And all ya girlfriends, they lookin' like models
Treat us like celebrities from the time that we get out the car to the VIP
What you drinkin' ma? See I like what you're wearin' and it's fittin' ya ma
See you sexy in appeal, I could picture me ma
I got mirrors on my ceil' when I'm hittin' ya ma
When I'm hittin' ya ma, dang it...

[Chorus]

[Buddha Monk]
Zu mackin', step up in the club
Lookin' for that girl nails done and feed scrubbed
Her elegance, got a thug issue
We was stuck on the island like Ginger with Phil again
Hulk adrenaline, got her ass bendin'
Her waist cuffed, better feel, oh Mr. Pelican
Zu backward man means under your zucinni
Persperation from this dance got that thing stringy
Keep it there ma, let me know what you drinkin'
Don't stop ma, how many chips before I'm hittin' it?
You right there ma, girl I'm not kiddin'
Swerve in a Suburban with an ass like Free's

[Chorus]

[12 O'Clock]
Yeah let's take her to the crib, yeah that girl in the pink
(Come here) We could sex on the covers of this mink
Kitchen table or the bathroom sink
What do you think? Don't act like ya shit don't stink
Can you get me somethin' to eat? Chick, I'll buy you a Frank
Lemme play with ya hair while ya head down there
See I hope that you share, I got my man right here
You scared? You like it in the front or the rear? Say yeah

[Buddha Monk]
Keep it there ma, let me know what you drinkin'
Don't stop ma, how many chips before I'm hittin' it?
You right there ma, girl I'm not kiddin'
Swerve in a Suburban with an ass like Free's
Yes, club night, bottle pops, model hops
I look at the room right, look at knees right
And she's like now (Go down baby)
I'm like, "LL, yo slow down baby.. whoa!"

[Chorus]</pre>
