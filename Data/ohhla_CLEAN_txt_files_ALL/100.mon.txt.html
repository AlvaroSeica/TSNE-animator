Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro]
I let it fall, my heart
And as it fell, you rose to claim it
It was dark and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me
My hands, they're strong, but my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms without falling to your feet

But there's a side to you that I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say, they were never true, never true

[Chorus]
Promise always keep 100 strapped with 100 clips
Started from 100 dollars tryna make 100 Ms
Lost 100 niggaz bought bout about 100 whips
Made about 100 visits sent about 100 flicks
100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100 100

[Cheeze]
Your new mixtape albums we break upon
Put that mac in his face no make up on
Home invasions your mouth we puttin tape upon
Blaze through your forehead no shape up on
Yeah its cheeze I'm the one that get my cakin on
In the kitchen pie flippin with my apron on
I gotta have patience but they taking long
They ain't got no cool nigga breakin on
100 bottles 100 bitches
2 o's 100 swishas
Million dollar dream blue dream wishes
Ice shining tryna scheme with your misses

[Chorus]
Promise always keep 100 strapped with 100 clips
Started from 100 dollars tryna make 100 Ms
Lost 100 niggaz bought bout about 100 whips
Made about 100 visits sent about 100 flicks
100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100 100

[Chinx Drugz]
Took took took the game by surprise they ain't see us coming
See they tracks in the sand got these suckers running
Fresh off this life from poverty board that money train
Put 100 on your head you can keep the change
I lost 100 niggaz gained zero friends
I'm 6-0 feel like I never gain to win
Some call it ungrateful I call it overdue
Double styrephone cup with that purple juice leanin
Big money schemin
Dump tell stack I said what up
Fuck em I ain't lettin up
Got the game by the testi cal
Gun range tested sks and the 50 cals
Quiet but my jewerly loud
My money went from spud webb to Manute Bol
Im ballin hot these niggaz luke cold
They dont want the money
Thats why they run from it
If you a stand up nigga then keep it 100

[Chorus]
Promise always keep 100 strapped with 100 clips
Started from 100 dollars tryna make 100 Ms
Lost 100 niggaz bought bout about 100 whips
Made about 100 visits sent about 100 flicks
100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100 100

[French]
My niggaz put in work
Shawty held me down
Hustlin paid the bills
Karma came around
That fast money came nigga then I lost touch
When it sounds too good nigga I never trust it
From crabs in the bucket to them lobster tails
From the block to trynna get madonna sale
They got keys from west, to hittin key west
Thats a mother fucker, delonte west
Gettin high off moll nigga, fuck niggaz lame
Thats a hundred thou trynna fix the pain
Niggaz stole our style trynna switch the game
Hoppin out the shower throw on a hundred chain</pre>
