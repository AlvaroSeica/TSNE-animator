oh mama you don't want a one minute man ?
Well give me a chance let me get in it damn
If you want it that long you better know that I tax
I can hit the cat strong even make you climax
Crawl down to your toes anything goes
I got your body shivering like baby den froze
I'm delivering the brown on skin just call
you can even bring your friends it could be us all
Cause I'm down for the freak I smoke a pound a week
so all around the streets I find pounds to beat
They Rio gotta tone and he pound discrete
I keep them smothered on the phone cause they sound so sweet
It's a word around town that I'm making it last
Yeah I swerve around town cause I'm making my cash
But if your down for a round baby just ask
but I promise I won't confess

oh mama
oh come to papa Yes mama papa
You got that twa twa and I want it bad
oh mama won't you come to papa
Yes mama papa I promise I won't confess

So if it's on then it's on
I like to hear them moan on the phone
in between you know they fien my zone
All the women from my block say my thing is long
And I can work around the clock cause I bring my bone
So if you really wanna jock then baby give me a fix
And I'll be running like a fox with plenty of tricks
hold on to my glock let me give you a hiss
As I beat it on the spot, with plenty of stick
Cause imma do what I do cause I love the sex
I'm so new to the crew but I plug the best
They say Rio was a fool the way he dug your chest
and the way you played it cool by saying he was the best
So if it's on then it's on we can do it make it last
while your sporting your thong, getting truant in the grass
Imma hit you with my song we can do it for the cash
But I promise I won't confess

oh mama
oh come to papa Yes mama papa
You got that twa twa and I want it bad
oh mama won't you come to papa
Yes mama papa I promise I won't confess

I don't wanna be a brag man I never had nane
So I'm gonna give it every minute like a mad man
take you to your limits when I'm in it not a bad plan
hit you like I'm Lennox you know I gotta brag And
I don't wanna take it to the streets of klash
All I'm really trying to do is get a piece of ass
Take them out like the trash as the fun just last
but I promise I won't confess

[Chorus 3X]
oh mama
oh come to papa Yes mama papa
You got that twa twa and I want it bad
oh mama won't you come to papa
Yes mama papa I promise I won't confess</pre>
