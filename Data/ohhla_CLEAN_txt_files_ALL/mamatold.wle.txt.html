Song:   Mama Told Me
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus x2]
Mama told me there'd be days like this
But I ain't never ever think there'd be a day like this (Naw!)
Not now not ever, and now until forever you will never need another (Nigga!)

Look...
Sorry hiphop, it took me so long to get on but so long that I'm on it, it's on!
I'm rappin' for the scholars and the hustla's, meanwhile
Showin' mama I ain't dropped out for nothin'!
I swear these dolla's gon' add up
And I ain't shallow, material things suppress bad luck
That's why I shine like I does, it's pain in my eyes but these east saints blind you to look
Binded between, carryin' the flag for an area that drag, whoever tried to gravitate
G told me it's a city full of crimes, I'm feelin' like a platter at Philip's when I rap
As much as I wanted to be minisculed the fact is, they'd only be happy with a minstrel actor
Sorry Mr. Charlie won't chap dance, and fuck the radio for tellin' me to snap jam
I'm just expectin' the spectator's respect here
My net is from jet setters to cab fares
Hip-hop's unbalances got out of hand
Ain't have to see-saw, I'm already scared
I been called the ??
And I DC'd this whole fuckin' genre
And I ain't in it for them O's or them comma's
But more or less the hope for dope niggaz to prosper
Yessir...

[Chorus]

The future is now, I lead on record's dedicaton for makin' better music is now
Dope niggaz locked out 4 year rap drought
It's rainin' now somehow the fugitive's out
I would invest in a poncho, 'cause I ain't finna punch out like Glass Joe (Naw!)
Ima go until my arm's sore, fuck it! I go until my 40 millionth encore
Hip-hop's dead yeah that's what Nas said to me
I guess that's hip-hop heads on salary
We've had the tables, on them record labels
Who's next to release? We guillotine them
Niggaz braggin' but everybody stagnant everybody broke except the nigga on the track (Shit!)
And mama why you throw away my drums?
A hundred for a deal they made a hundred on the song
Nigga I'm a hundred miles far, I'm feelin' Chris Childs
You lookin' like Kobe Bryant ya'll
It's lonely at the top so I waited, but ain't nobody take it
Now I'm playin' solitaire patient
Crucifix pieces, necklace with Jesus
See me as blasphemous for I don't need them
God give me strength, Allah give me patience
I am only a man and I don't know what to think

[Chorus]</pre>
