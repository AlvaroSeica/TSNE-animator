[Intro: Raekwon]
What up son?, maintaining, maintaining, you know?
You good, right? Everything proper, still, right?
Come on, man, what's the matter wit you, man?
Ain't nothing, I just want us to be on

[Chorus: Method Man]
Tell a friend, it's that symbol again, that W
Coming through, bust a shot on your block, give me a suu (suuuuuuu!)
Get it right, all my chicks hold ya tits, let's get it in
All my niggas take a toke off this weed, let it begin
(Here we go), yo, ya'll already know what it do
Brand new, nigga, back from the slums, it be the Wu
(Now throw ya W's up), back from the slums, it be the Wu

[Raekwon]
Love to dress a lab, get rocked, hundred bags, black doorags
Ski masks is on, g wags
Don't try to take pictures, 'lax, still in the grass
You'll learn respect, *gunshot* wanna ask
Rhyme master busy, wizzy on the subject, love Deck
Thug battle drug vets, snub sets, iller than most
Night time tokes, gorillas in boats, three boats
Villains is killa, gangstas flip notes
Hibernation yo, switch up, liver nation, fly information
Vivid vacation, deliberation moments
Move like 91 Romans, cloning everything
Gents only, the rent's on the stove, I'm in Rome
Maxed out, Annex style, my team brand bandits
Make a move and get blown off the planet, baby
Hold that cannon, just understand we got the whole shit
Padlocked down, my niggas won't have it

[Chorus]

[Ghostface Killah]
Aiyo, jumping out of Benz wagons, my family live in the Hill
They call us Bin Ladens, laughing, turbaned up
Faggot niggas get murdered up, these streets is like radio beef
So watch how the kid turn it up
Bulletproof tuxes, knuckle games is clobbering busters
Eighteen niggas is bringing the ruckus
Flame throwers on our backs and shoulders, the rusty joints still work
The trey eight'll blow one of your doujas
When it's mad, he the mad calm, walk around
Gold collect, 36, so before G bomb
My inner strength flowing, I mastered chi kung
Ya'll Planet of the Apes, standing next to King Kong
Forensic file, ultraviolet hype, sky blue Bales
Laying niggas like ceramic tile
I'm like Urlacher, beasting at the top of the pile
Kneeing niggas in the nuts, nigga, damn I'm foul

[Chorus]

[Method Man]
We blow money, got game, hungry, we pop things
Look for me, crams in my pocket, Chef cook for me
Blue Magic bundles, I'm dope, but on the humble
I'm a good dude, don't short change me, see that's our hood through
Beer drinkin', Cuban Linking, new way of thinking
Got me thinking, Meth, break the handcuffs, run out the precinct
This is hard body, hard knocks, if you pushing that hard rock
Then let these niggas go off top
We rock fitted, drop kitted, I live it and not quit it
I pitch it, my pops sniffed it, mean business, I'm not finished
I'm *sniff* too hot wit it, you bitching, the plot thicken
I'm shitting, the glock spitting, if nigga don't stop snitching
Just what the block missing, the two-seater wit the top missing
And two divas wit the tops missing
Now that's living to me, I'm what these kids is killing to be
But I don't want my children to be

[Chorus]</pre>
