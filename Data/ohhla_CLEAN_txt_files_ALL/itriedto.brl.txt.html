Song:   I Tried to Commit Suicide
Typed by: jordtuba@gmail.com

[Chorus] (x2)
I tried to commit suicide
I had a gun in my mouth and a tear in my eye
Where's my motherfuckin' daughter at?
Think about the next place I could slaughter at
I know she wonders where her father's at

[Verse 1]
I tried to commit suicide, I had a lot on my mind
I couldn't figure nothin' out and my mama just died
It's like, damn, everything was blowin' up in my mind
I couldn't determine what was wrong or right, I'm goin' Madesicc
I ain't the type to bitch, whine and moan
But now I'm in a weird place and I'm really missin' home
Not metaphorically, I'm really missin' home
I couldn't explain how much I'm really missin' home, mind gone
I'm on some shit that'll get you locked up
Put in the truck, nigga, that's life, shit's fucked up
I remember when I used to sit at home, all alone
In my room, thinkin' I'm hungry for food
My mama screamin' in the front room, drivin' me crazy
I feel like jumpin' out the window, I'm itchin' like scabies
'Cause my mind's tryin' to frame me and nobody cares
I might as well take this nine-milli' and die right here

[Chorus] (x2)

[Verse 2]
Like to keep a gun, I'm always on the watch-out
Niggas think I'm dumb 'til I pull that Glock out
Leave a nigga numb, somebody bring the cops out
His work day is done, yeah, he had to clock out
I can bring the block out, niggas don't really want that
Send 'em on a plane with that thing and it's dark black
Plastic and as if I asked it, he came out
Couldn't trust a nigga, so I maintain the same route
Why should I trust a nigga? They think with they penis
Then they wonder why it's friction between us
I'm tryin' to get a Venus, so suck a duck you motherfuckers
I could just leave it and treat it like another supper
I could just eat it, take it how it comes
And when it's all said and done, we ain't gotta wait for reruns
I can't even see cuz' in the rear-view mirror
Hey, let me get right back to this nine

[Chorus] (x2)

My life been so fucked-up, it's all on a bitch
Ever since I was 13, I wanted to be rich
Tried sellin' dope, nah, that didn't work out
I was jookin' in the creek, I couldn't get my work out
Too many niggas was jookin', that brought the cops out
Yeah, I went back to the Gardens and Mom kept me locked out
Livin' in the Regal, thinkin' somethin' illegal
We know how it is when you ain't workin' with them eagles
Dope money paid for my EP, Tower Records
Put it on consignment, I had a sample of "Knee Deep"
Those days was good days, these days is no good
Niggas think I got a million, prob'ly 'cause I prob'ly should
Sittin' in this tight-ass studio, 'bout to change it
Reverse and rearrange it, now I'm with Strange, bitch
This better work out, I'm tired of the same shit
So I put it in my mouth, yeah, I'm goin' out

[Chorus] (x2)

[Skit]
(Do it! Don't think about it, just do it!) (x4)

I'm in here! I'm in here!
Nah, the door's locked for a reason! Hold up! I'll be out there!
Who is that? Is that Destiny? Is that Faith or Destiny? Which one?
I'll be out there in a minute, hold up!

I can't do this. I can't do this, this fucked up! Damn!
(Do it! Don't think about, just do it!) (x2)</pre>
