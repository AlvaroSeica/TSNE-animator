Typed by: Cno Evil

[Chorus 2X: Bronze Nazareth]
Flashes of brilliance....
Cash in abundance...
Swallowed by these buildings...
Peace of mind, but I don't tell you 'bout the illness...

[Phillie]
Swallowed by these buildings, never seen the Sun
A young outlaw, sworn to the almighty gun
Get robbed for your funds, it's jobs to be a thug
Little knucklehead nigga, it's trouble ahead, nigga
Some say just one dead nigga, a waste of skin
Sands of law, took it personal, the hatred of men
Had a nack for escape, show flashes of brilliance
Resilient, to capture a master at disappearing
One day his luck was up, running with the pistol
They never saw him throw it, and bullets was on the menu
His family sued and received an abundance of cash
But you know, black folk, they ran through it fast
Leave you with peace of mind, the streets designed
To make a self destruct button, we must leave the blind
Through the labyrinth, throw 'em to the lion's den
In the end, pride is the ultimate prize to wind

[Kevlaar 7]
The illness is peace of mind, he ain't slept in years
Rip Van tears, in glock buildings
Healing held up, a chemist king perfect in threats
The serpent in buildings, he silently calling for help
The cousin of Grim, death, prison walls captured him
An early abundance of greed, of green land
Cash in hand, in houses at seventeen
Like cream wool Jesus, he wore brilliant Muhammad pieces
And leases gooses and clout, rerouted innocent brilliance
I could of filled him with knowledge, from night to dawn
Knowledge to born, now it's federal prison horns
Claps of thunder torn, a Gun Rule b-boy in a song...

[Chorus 2X]

[Bronze Nazareth]
Yo, we show flashes of brilliance, with evil in his eyes
Used to carry mom's groceries, when she be in the house
We used to fight over Tiana fat ass, throw my chain in sixth grade
So I took this nigga Kool Moe Dee tape
Now I hear he run with nominated soldiers, and my man June
Got beef with anybody, leave that glass off that coster
Meanwhile over turkey sausage, niggas is flossin'
In the middle of a weed draught, I'm coughing
So Sixth Month, dialled his man, who he cop from often
Guess who walked in, Tiana with a Grace Jones fade, yo
And her man said, "You that nigga that stole my Kool Moe!"
June stood up, my numero uno
Bullets travelled through the heart, now we arrive at the funeral
Swallowed by these buildings, drowning in beers
His grandma said he already been dead for years
All I saw was the face of his moms, was fearce
How after the laughter, then comes the tears
And I don't go to funerals, they keep me away
But in his casket, I left a new Kool Moe Dee
But wait, they threw June cell keys off in the abyss
I tried to give you peace of mind, when I don't tell you about the illness...</pre>
