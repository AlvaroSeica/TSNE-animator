[Edi talking]
Loyalty....
Some of yall niggaz dont even know what the fuck that is
A whole lot of niggaz (yeah)
Some of yall niggaz'll never know Loyalty
Wanna hate on me?
Nigga fuck you and yo family
I stay true to what I know and thats Outlaw (who?)
It aint no me in this muthafucka without yall

We went from nothing to something 
Hustlin' and bubblin' 
And aint ask niggaz for nothin' (shit) 
Shit that made other cliqs I split 
Made us tighter
Fuck the industry
Cause I ain't no dick rider
You see me nigga
I ain't lost a pound
Still eatin', still breathin' 
Still reackin' off that cali shit
And I ain't never want muthafuckas to handle shit
You see me pushin' .22's? 
Nigga handle it
Feelin' good like we just won a championship
New money, new label 
Keep it crackin' bitch
And I'ma get the last laugh 
You can count on it
And stay away from you mutherfuckas that's counterfeit
Loyalty..................... snitch ass nigga

[Chorus]
Somethin' bout loyalty
It always avoided me
As far as my eyes can see
I can only depend on me
What's loyalty?

[Edi - repeat 2X]
It's like a jungle sometimes
We keep on hustlin'
But they wanna take us under, under, under

[Napoleon]
God damn I'm glad you set it off
Used to be hard
Now you just went soft
Poison, young nigga, bitch to society
Once had love for em
Why the fuck he lied to me?
Kicked out the crew cause his soul aint strong
Started sniffin' herion
Nigga you wrong
And I aint never hang around fag ass niggaz
Rappin niggaz alseep in the county ass niggaz
My family strong like the mafia
It aint no thang to put a slug thru ya
Scary ass nigga
Damy ass nigga
Wont throw rice in a wedding ass nigga
Loyalty

[Kamikaze]
I cant stand the fake and the snake never
Worse the betrayal
You scared of the heat muthafucka? 
Stay away from the barrel
And I aint never been a rat
Or been scared to ride
A lot of niggaz act tough
But know they pie inside
Death before dishonor
But you really scared to die
We could spit a verse about you
We put yo life on the line
Military mind aint never put his nose on the line
A real souljah never retreats
When it's time for a crime

[Young Noble]
Hey yo....
You can talk that shit
But how many of yall can do what we did?
Muthafuckas talkin' bout the Lawz aint shit
Bitch ass nigga should get off the Lawz dick
Muthafuckas mad that we got our own label
Outlaw Recordz, we aint fuckin with you haters
Niggaz know the Lawz been holdin' this down
If you dont see him now
We dont fuck with that clown
Loyalty... (uhuh)

[Chorus]
Somethin' bout loyalty
It always avoided me
As far as my eyes can see
I can only depend on me
What's loyalty?

[Edi - repeat 2X]
It's like a jungle sometimes
We keep on hustlin'
But they wanna take us under, under, under

[Kastro]
What's Loyalty?
When a nigga say he love you
But all awhile he dont think nothin' of you
And that's just what love do
Stab ya in the heart
Grab you in the dark
And rip families apart
Damn... we was supposed to be fam
We had plans
Now I claim to understand you
I guess life is a gamble
I shook the dice
But I betted on the peasent
Then I took a dive
Like oohhhhh.... 
How come I ain't know
I should've seen it was simply soul
Now I know.... what's loyalty
It's all clear to me
These words is for the birds
You aint real to me
Life is a liar
Got me spinning like the tires
Hug a drunk driver, back and forth
you ain't ready and you petty
So I laugh it off
But it's a cost to be the boss
You gon' pay for not being loyal

[Ed Bone]
My life's a blessin'
My life's a lesson
And if it's ride or die
There aint no question
Aint no time for second guessin'
We aint bustas
Niggaz aint new to this shit
We some muthafuckin' ridahs
And yall niggaz is the opposite
I sense bitch like a dog sense fear
So yall better act right
Anytime that I'm near
Live in yo ear
Everyone's a ridah in here
Cross game
Watch them ridahs appear
Muthafucka

[Chorus]
Somethin' bout loyalty
It always avoided me
As far as my eyes can see
I can only depend on me
What's loyalty?</pre>
