Uhhh, yeah, that's my type of shit right there
Uh, we taking this one here to the club
Real niggas out your hands up, thug niggas put your hands up
Where the ladies, put your hands up
Everybody put they hands up, look

[Hook]
I'm in the club, to the early morning
Don't wanna go home, I'ma fight the yawning
I like to party, to the break of dawn
And I'm full of alcohol, that's just a warning that
(me and my niggas, is known for wilding and)
Me and my niggas, is known for wilding and
(me and my niggas, is known for wilding and)
Me and my niggas, is known for wilding and

[Magic]
I'm in the club, with a sack of bud
And I'ma smoke right here, cause I don't give a fuck
Security know, I break the rules
I smoke I drank, that's what I do
High as a kite, and full of that yack
You know what I'm bout, you know where I'm at
I'm ducked off, in the corner
Lips stuck to your woman's ear, telling her I want her
Don't know, when I had enough
I want, one more drink and one more puff
I want, one more dance with one more hoe
I ain't leaving this bitch, till they lock the do'

[Hook]

[Magic]
(who in the DJ booth)
Tell the nigga, he doing his thang and that's fa sho
He making sho them hoes, don't leave the flo'
It's getting hot, and I'm starting to sweat
I'm ready to fight, this bout to be a night to regret
(me and my niggas, is known for wilding and)
Me and my niggas, is known for wilding and
(me and my niggas, is known for wilding and)
Me and my niggas, is known for wilding and
In the crowd, where they push and shove
Is where you'll find me, every nigga with me a thug
Start something, see what I'm bout
Talk shit, and they gon carry out

[Hook]

If you real with it nigga, put your hands up
If you bout handling bidness, put your hands up
Thug niggas put your hands up
Come on, independent put your hands up
Come on, where the ladies put your hands up
Come on, everybody put your hands up
