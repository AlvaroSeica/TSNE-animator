[Phonte - singing]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh, oh, ooh baby
Oh, oh, oh, yeah

Wondering if
A face that wears a smile like yours
Has ever heard a no before (hahah)
Such a beauty and a blessing
And if no one will tell it, I will, I will
Wondering if
A man like me could swallow his pride
Would you stay with me and stand by my side?
And let nothing come between it
Girl, you know I really mean it, for real, for real, for real

[Chorus]
When she lays down at night
I wonder what she sees
When she thinks of paradise
Maybe she'll dream of me
So every night I pray
That when she goes to sleep
and she dreams of a love
Maybe she'll dream of me

[Phonte - singing]
Just imagine the possibilities (talk about the possibilities)
If you would only let down your guard
I always say, my love is easy babe
You don't have to make it so hard, so hard yeah
I know you want nothing else
But you can try and tell yourself
It's all a game, all a game
I know you've been lonely wishing
for a love that goes the distance
Call my name, cause I am in love with you

[Chorus]

[Phonte - rapping]
Go easy, uh
I'm thinking that you're out of my league
Walking round looking like something right out of my dreams
People saying me and you is like the finest cheer leader
going with the dude that got picked last for the team
But desire's a miraculous thing
When your soul get ravenous, all you want is just a little happiness
and you would gladly grab it from the average things
No matter how it look or how absurd that it seems
So it's pertinent to stay with what is working, I mean
even if your perfect person is alerted by screams
and whispers and yells, and whyles
And how are they together man? I just can't believe
This is something that the OGs call composure, keep me in mind
Baby you are my star and I'm now realigned
Sweet candy for me and my dreaming eyes
And when I lay down at night, maybe you'll be in mine
Know what I'm sayin?
