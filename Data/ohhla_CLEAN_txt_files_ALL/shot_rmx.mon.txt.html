Met her back stage at a Summer Jam concert (CLAP YOUR HANDS TO THIS!!!)
Hair like Rihanna, shoe game was awesome (CLAP YOUR HANDS TO THIS!!!)
Could tell by her aura she want a shot caller (CLAP YOUR HANDS TO THIS!!!)
Wanna be with a baller, shot caller 
Could tell by her aura she want a shot caller
Wanna be with a baller, shot caller (Aiyyo Montana!!)
Could tell by her aura she want a shot caller (Yeah! Let these niggas know man!)
