[sample]
Black people y'all better realize that we losing
You better gotdamn fight, and die if you got to
Nahmsayin but now niggaz is ready to die over a coat
A necklace 'round your throat! That's bullshit

[Hook]
[Crayon]
A criminal mind when living behind
Material times just seek and you'll find
(Scratches)
That's the life we livin
[Crayon]
Surrounded by hate, we chasin for papes
But sealing our fate, we hate it but wait!
(Scratches)
That's the life we livin

[Crayon]
The hottest summers, coldest winters
Kids play ball with frozen fingers
While the gunsmoke often lingers
We pack pistols by our penis
Blow the brains from out them dreamers
Blood spilling on the cement
Painting walls making murals
For the ones no longer breathing
Writing raps for my eulogies
Pawning TVs and jewelry
Some of us perfectly happy
Living in the lap of poverty
Choices that apply to me
Pay rent or be homeless
By the way this shit is going
We gonna never be owners
Got no time to brush shoulders
When police all up on us
They be coming at us daily
With evictions and warrants
Trying to escape
The corners and coffins
Where stick up kids be warring
And any face that's foreign
Can get shot off of boredom

[Hook]
[Crayon]
A criminal mind when living behind
Material times just seek and you'll find

That's the life we livin
[Crayon]
Surrounded by hate, we chasin for papes
But sealing our fate, we hate it but wait!
(Scratches)
That's the life we livin

[Rock Shabazz]
New York streets is hell, shades of blue and oranges
The rotten apple stuck in Adam or Eve's oesophagus
Your head is a sarcophagus, your cranium's a coffin
That's why street niggaz is mentally dead very often
Amateur abortions, toilet bowls is coffins
High school is warzones, educational system rotten
Kids commit crimes out of boredom
Started regretting as soon as the officers caught em
We're stuck in Sodom and Gomorrah
Same crime, bail varies
Mama sayin Hail Marys
Shorties getting knocked up, so now forcefully getting married
Riding subway cars to entry level jobs
Watching Black men hardened from years of tryna act hard
I get slight chills from these niggaz' ice grills
Civilzed still, thirst like a savage for the bills
On the corner of Black Man boulevard and Nigga ave searchin for direction
These streets is teachin valuable lessons

[Hook]
[Crayon]

(Scratches)
That's the life we livin

[Scratches]
I keep livin like this I might lose it
Life (Life) as a shortie shouldn't be so rough
I keep livin like this I might lose it
I walk down the block with my stomach in knots
Life as a shortie shouldn't be so rough
Living in the ghetto trying to get the hell out
That's the life we livin

[Rock Shabazz]
Nigga I gotta get paid!
I've been waisting my life since the tenth grade
It's time to get paid!
By legal means, no sense in doing crimes
Niggaz is so blind they take pride in doing time
Different judge same case, different bid same place
It's like having a different exponent with the same base
Same mistakes with greater stakes, saddened by the lives we livin
A grown ass man gotta make the wise decisions

[Crayon]
Catch post-traumatic syndrome
From semi automatic shots flown
In these cold city streets where I roam
Same block different time zone
Some cats is 7-30
I wake very early
Landlord like Mr.Ferley
And I never get no peace
My mom is filled with grief
At night I hear her crying
Cause they ain't renew the lease
I'm looking forward to some beef
And each days a mystery
And even if I D-I-E
I swear 2 God I wanna leave

That's the life we livin

But sealing our fate, we hate it but wait!
