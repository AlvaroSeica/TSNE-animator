[Intro: YC]
Whatchu got? Racks on racks on racks 
(He got) racks on racks on racks 
(We got) racks on racks on raaacks (Leh'go!)
Ayy~! I got, racks on racks on racks
(She got) racks on racks on racks
(They got) racks on racks on racks

[Chorus: YC]
Got campaign goin so strong 
Gettin brain while I'm talkin on the phone
Spend money when ya money gets long
Real street nigga, ain't no clone
We at the top where we belong
Sip lean, ros√©, Patron
Smokin on thousand dollar worth of strong
when the club 'bout to hear this soooong (Whatchu got?)
We got racks on racks on racks (racks)
Racks on racks on racks (racks)
Racks on racks on racks (racks)
Got racks on racks on raaaaacks 
Got racks on racks on racks (racks)
Racks on racks on racks (racks)
Racks on racks on racks (racks)
Nigga ain't even tryna hold baaaack

[YC]
Got a car outta my garage (So many cars!)
Got a condo down in the stars (Swag!)
I'm geeked up off them bars 
Got a car, I ain't even gotta park (Park itself)
No keys. push button start (SKERT!)
She ain't a dime I won't get hard
Got hoes that need a green card 
Say I'm a dog but I don't even gotta bark {*woof*}
Got 'em bitin this swag like sharks
One hit, I'ma knock it out the park 
Trap be so goddamn hard
Got kush, got lean, got barre
Got remix hard as scale
Got bricks, don't need no scale
I'm plugged in with the mail
I'm part of the Cartel
Got re-rock, ain't no cling (Remix!)
Six-two hundred for a nin' (the 'nina)
Then fuck it all up on jeans 
I'm a True Religion fiend
Got bands in the pockets of my jeans (Where dey at?)
Need a kickstand way I lean (F'real!)
Promethazine fiend
Stamped on Sprite and lean 

[Chorus]

[Future]
No choice by force I sport, then go and cop some ice
Designer on my mojo, I live in the spotlight
Real street nigga ain't no flaw, young Future gotta keep that raw
That swag I gave you niggaz, I'ma need me a round of 'plause
(Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!) Bravo, Bravo, Bravo!
Got a hundred thousand dollars worth of clothes 
I'm froze I'm froze I'm cold
I keep me a big bank roll, I ain't trickin off on these hoes
These hoes bringin me they soul, I will never sell my soul
Cashed out on all the cars, these foreign foreign broads
Got a nigga livin in the stars, I'm on my way to Mars
Got Keisha, Pam, and Nicki, they all wanna do a +Minaj+
Ay one freeband freeband, we ain't ever got a goddamn flauge

[Chorus]

[YC]
Y'all know I keep them racks
I stay countin them stacks
Ya girl won't leave me 'lone 
Wanna fuck, now she attaaaached
Flow hot don't need no match
Sell work don't pay no tax
I'm turnt up to the max
Don't even know how to relaaax
I drank so much that lean
Had to wake up on a bean
Got racks off in my jeans
Man it bustin out the seams
Got kush all in my lungs
Get high like Cheech and Chong
Eight hundred a zone 
I ain't blowin unless it stroooong
Gettin head on my iPhone
Catch mine and then I'm gone
The girl won't leave me 'lon
I can not take her hoooome
I'm gone on them bars
Bitch I'm not a star
I'm driving foriegn cars
Strapped up no bodyguaaaaards

[Chorus]</pre>
