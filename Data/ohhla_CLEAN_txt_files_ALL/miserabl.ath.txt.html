Typed by: Atherton

[INTRO/CHORUS]
Yeah I made it through that miserable December
Yeah I made it through to the other side
Yeah I made it through that miserable December
Look below my nose I still know how to smile
I made it through that miserable December
I made it through to the other side
I made it through that miserable December
Look below my waist I still walk with some style

[Atherton]
As I watched her cry, I couldn't help but wonder why
I never let the liquid leak from these pressurized eyes of mine
Designed over time to stay dry
Rotten got bottled up and tossed to the wayside
See my eyes are desert islands in the middle of a sea
of hemophiliac tear drops that never cease to bleed
Surrounded my this grief, it finally took its toll
In that miserable December when the weather gets, cold
Came with the cold, to paint on my skull
Twisted pictures that let the pain unfold
And for shame I sold her a piece of my shoulder
Only to maintain the frame from falling over
Roller Coaster never passed inspection
Keeps rolling over rusted track sections
Massive pressure - elephant on a thimble
Bones do break when made so nimble
Simple - stuck in her sadness
And I was in love with her lack of fantastic
Classic case of a devil and an angel
Obsessive reflections of each others opposing angles
Mangled tangled dementia's apprentice
Never broke my heart but boy did she ever bend it
And it mended to my skin with an unbearable weight
So this lopsided style is how I walk today!

[BRIDGE]
(*Na-na-na-na-na and Di-di-di-di singing bits*)

[PRE-CHORUS]
That year only had 11 months
No days in December never saw the sun shine once
That year only had 48 weeks 
The clock skipped ahead to the peak of New Year's Eve
Only 334 days in the year
Calendar company got off easy I fear
Between me and you, December didn't exist
You get it, got it, good now buy me some new Saucony Kicks
Bitch!

[CHORUS]

I still walk with.. some style</pre>
