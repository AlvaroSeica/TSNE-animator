[Verse 1] (Skinny DeVille)
Yeah....ha....uh....
They say success is the best revenge, tell a friend
keep 'em close like a enemy, invest to win
safeless, the necessary, leave the rest to them
loose lips sink boats, try your best to swim
captain of your ship, do ya best and grin
never let 'em see you sweat the stress again
and make a new direction, take ya next of kin
out the trap, it's called life--make the best of it

[Verse 2] (Fishscales)
Well it's the F-I-S-H S-C-A-L-E-S
you can find me rollin' hella sess
I keep a smile cause I never stress
I'm gettin' love in Kentucky from Paducah back to Somerset
and yeah I'm country I don't run from that
I got a catalogue full of 16s say I come from there
and this is me all day, I'm never clockin in'
just wanna say thank y'all for just stoppin' in 

[Hook]
Welcome to the show, welcome to the show, Welcome to the show (x4)

[Verse 3] (Big V)
Dear God, let them hear me and see you
thanks heavenly for what you allow me to do
all things are possible when I go through you
thanks for the caterin' and real good food
thanks for the DJ and 5-man crew
bless him for the fans, God, you the man
well, as I bring this to a close
bless me with a feel for the real good (HOES!!!)

[Verse 4] (B. Stille)
Uh, I rock the, v-neck tees, wrinkly jeans
old people askin' me "do  you sleep in them jeans?"
I reply, "no sir or ma'am, this is the style,"
big smile, I ain't felt like this in a while
see the young'ns on the block, tell 'em stay in that school
gangbangin', hangin' out, smokin', drinkin' ain't cool
show you how to be a leader, just follow your dreams
and always vow to keep it Nappy by any means

[Hook]
Dude, dude, you guys are phenomenal dude...
I promise...I mean, my sister loves you guys...
I joined this frat because of you guys...
Fuckin' awesome, man...
Nappy fuckin' Roots

[Verse 5] (Ron Clutch)
The world's a stage, just tryin' to play my part
keep my feet on earth and still parlay with the stars
yeah I be spacin' out, vacation to Mars
but when I return, I come back with the burn
what you learn? Sometimes you have to take it that far
it's more important how you finish than the way that you start
life is bittersweet, even taste a lil' tart
let you make the situation, it don't make who you are
you can't throw in your hand, might as well play with your cards
you win some, you lose some, don't take it to heart
take it to the next level, take it way out the chart
you don't wanna leave here without makin' your mark
bet your light shine, find your way out the dark
surround yourself with good energy so you can stay charged
stay on the cuttin' edge, make sure your blades stay sharp
art imitates life, life imitates art...
