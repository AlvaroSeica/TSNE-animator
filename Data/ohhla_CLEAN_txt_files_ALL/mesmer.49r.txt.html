Blew my mind without the nine
She's banging like the beat without the rhyme
And I find she shines like a diamond that sits on one's wrist
Real simple like a track that fits on one disk
Had to have her grab her when the sun sets
Achieving oneness never knew what comes next
Something came over me but wouldn't that be fun to see
Rushed in like Wilber Montgomery
All my other girls started looking really dumb to me
But if you would have told me then that you wouldn't fuck with me
After a couple of years it got rocky
Like Clubber Lang when the boy got sloppy
She got me for my dollars got me for my cents
Got me for my Aquimini and my incense
Got me getting bent cause now I'm late with my rent
Taking shorts like my temper getting heated like the vents yo

Now as I think back it doesn't make sense
I went head first not thinking of the consequence
Man, I should have played it cool
But I ain't never fall this fast I couldn't help but play the fool
Since the first day of school she sat next to me in class
Man I'm telling ya, an Asian from the Korean Peninsula
Foreign exchange never tainted by capitalism
Level headed not influenced by materialism
We went all year without speaking
Until the last week of class when she asked for my notes over the weekend
That was the spark that lit the fire
Instant messages until today became the prior
We both understood it wouldn't last that long
At the end of fall semester man she had to fly home
14 days never went so fast
Now she's back in South Korea and I'm thinking of the past

Learned my lesson like a pupil
Cause if you look into my pupils you'll see I got used like a loophole
And took the weight like a scapegoat
Paid the bills and next week I awake broke
But I can see clearly cause it's over now
Head racing severely like Dover Downs

The one thing you'll never stop
Is the hands of a clock
It's always gonna tick
And it's always gonna tock
You're working on the sun's time
So seize the opportunity before its bed time
Because days become hours, then hours become minutes
Until minutes become seconds damn I learned my lesson</pre>
