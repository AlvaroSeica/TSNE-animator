[Big Pimp]
I know dat y'all feel me now...
I know dat y'all feel me now...
I know dat y'all feel me now...
I know dat y'all feel me now...
I know dat y'all feel me now...
...feel me, feel me now

[Big Pimp]
Load it up, cock it back, get dropped bitch
None of y'all haters cain't stop this
Everyday we on the grind selling rocks bitch
Just because we got a deal, it don't stop bitch
I poured the cocaine in the pot bitch
When it drop and check it when it's hot bitch
We still tote dope in our socks bitch
Broke ass hoes tryna knock bitch
Runnin off atcha mouth, get popped bitch
AK, sawed-off, or a glock bitch
Runnin up in ya house or ya spot bitch
Now yo' ass tied up in a knot bitch
Take every damn thang that ya got bitch
The Pimp and the G got it locked bitch
On the pimp, so we got all the twat bitch
And the G, so we got all the blocks bitch
We did that thang in the 'Lac boy
I bought me another big 'Lac boy
I know y'all niggaz hate I did that boy
Put my name right back in the back boy - like dat boy
I know y'all niggaz don't give a fuck
So what? So when there come a time to bust
ya 'posed to buck - yo' nigga ass greasled up
Ya leave a nigga smoked up, just bring the dutch so what?
Y'all niggaz can't bring the pain and stop the fame
There ain't nothing more to explain, you must insane
It's like tryna stop a train in the rain
Now if the bitch doesn't take ya pain mane
Y'all niggaz don't know how it feels
To run with the k-ika thug niggaz that's real
Y'all niggaz better learn how to well
When Big Pimp come through slangin steel

[Big Pimp]
I know dat y'all feel me now...
I know dat y'all feel me now...
I know dat y'all feel me now...
I know dat y'all feel me now...
I know dat y'all feel me now...
I know dat y'all feel me now...
I know dat y'all feel me now...
...feel me, feel me now

[Mr. G Stacka]
I know, when all this beef jump, all my heat gon' blow
And when it the streets y'all peeps gettin broke
Got no time for hoes, cuz if you want the war
Then I'ma call my folks and bitch (let's go)
I ride, with G's and they strapped with them big tech nines
And they gon' catch yo' head and yo' neck and yo' spine
Ain't no need for crying, cuz I gotcha nine
and bitch that ass is mine
Don't be petrified, don't be scared to fire
I knew y'all boys' gon' run and hide
I knew y'all boys wattn't down to ride, now
So don't step, cuz a nigga hopin
That y'all boys know that we ain't jokin
Cuz a beatin prolly better have ya bones broken
The heat from this gat'll have ya ass soakin
My hands around ya neck'll have ya ass chokin
Throw you in the river now ya ass floatin
Fuck a bulletproff vest, get ya chest open
A lifeguard woulda be more impo'tant
Now you wanna hate cuz our styles be cold
Or ya sittin mad cuz ya really can't flow
And ya say you wanna rob but ya really don't show
For the same reasons that you already know
We'll take ya main broad havin her swallowin that blow
I don't give a fuck about you or ya hoe
And this steel that we slang like ya off on ya toes
How many y'all niggaz really want mo'?
What y'all fuck niggaz wanna clown on me fo'?
If you wanna take it there then we can go
Strangle ya throat bitch, watch ya die slow
Y'all lil' niggaz won't hate no mo!

[Big Pimp]
I know dat y'all feel me now...
I know dat y'all feel me now...
I know dat y'all feel me now...
I know dat y'all feel me now...
I know dat y'all feel me now...

[Mr. G Stacka]
All y'all niggaz who was talkin trash
I'll tell you right now, you can kiss my ass
And nan one of y'all in my paper stash
So I don't give a damn who the hell get mad
And I don't give a damn if you don't like this track
But I bet'cha right now that ya watching ya back
So the thugs in the back, let'cha know where I'm at
Got ya down on ya knees praying I don't attack
But right now it ain't no stopping
And right now it ain't no squashing
Cuz my click roll deep and we pack mo' heat than yo' boy Osama Bin Laden
So bitch tell me now what's poppin - I know ya feel me mane
And when my glock start sparkin, I'm killin everythang

[Big Pimp]
Shiiit.. I don't give a damn 'bout all that hatin
Cuz all y'all rappers' just overnight stops
Me and G, we been in the game like Larry Bird and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar
Freddy Lamar, Sanford and Son, Bubba and Grady
Good Times, JJ Sweet, Penny Lenny
We been doing talent shows since the first breakdancer was Crazy Vinnie
I took ya back to the TC Lockers
When Trinico was poppin and lockin
When my cous' Steve Ree was tickin
We was at home, wine droppin
You can take it how ya wanna bitch
And I want all y'all haters to know
The Westside is the crunkest side
From Riverside to Smiley Cove

I know dat y'all feel me now...
I know dat y'all feel me now...
I know dat y'all feel me now...</pre>
