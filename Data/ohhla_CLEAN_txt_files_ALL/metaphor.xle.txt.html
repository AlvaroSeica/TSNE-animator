1st Verse:
 
I have lived a wildlife
Put fruit on your lamp to give me the lime light
Watch on the opposite hand to make sure the times-right
Oh who am I? The names XALE
The definition of that can't be found using brail
Get out of my letterbox no time for male mail
They say video killed the radio star
Must have been a snuff tape of Houston HR
It's obvious I don't just dabble in rap
I throw my self in the deep end so give my paddle back!!!
And get energised so much I'm like that rabbit on crack
That used to be on TV
This cd is my cv
If someone kissed your ass they would get vd
From a he-she
I will throw you in a volcano to give you some deep-heat

2nd Verse:
 
I watched terminator and got I'm back
Tatted on my back
I want to raise money for awareness awareness
Because people don't realise my flairs are eccentric 
This track will make all clowns sad 
So move old horn-bag
I also heard when it comes to the sax your not great either
Your not a vampire but you can have this steak-and-eat-it
Leave old food in the fridge to make a crook crook your only getting peanuts
Taking a shower nude is they only time your wetting your penis
I'm enjoying the single life
That's a lie cos as I write
It's with a knife
Carving up some good shit for you
Only eat it if your starving because it is shit...plural 
One more bar than I'm done cut me off like a tumor</pre>
