[Waka Flocka Flame - Verse 1ne]
I FUCKED my money up -- (Damn!) 
Now I can't re-up
Ran up in his spot (spot) 
Just to get my stacks up
Now I'm back on deck (deck)
So shawty, what the FUCK you want?!
Heard he talkin shit (shit) 
But this ain't what the FUCK he want! (Flocka!)
Lock my CEO up, now it's back to coka
Niggaz talkin shit brah, hang 'em by the rope-a
Hit 'em wit the choppa, call dat shit hot llama
Call me waka Flocka, a/k/a Young wild Nigga
A/k/a Young Drug Dealer
Got purp, got kush, got pills, got white
In the trap all night, wit the hard and soft
Stacks on the flo', watch {?} boy whip it
Shook it to the left then he shook it to the right
So Icey, Brick Boys, got it all night
These lame ass niggaz ain't got no fight
Kick in my door we gon' shoot out all night
Home of the Braves, shawty shoot 'em wit a K

[Chorus 2X]
YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH~! 
O let's doooooo it
Hey - o let's doooooo it 
Hey - o let's doooooo it
YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH~!
Drug dealin music
Hey - I influence
Hey - I influence

[Waka Flocka Flame - Verse 2wo]
One shot, man down 
His brain go ka-POW~!!
Ow! Dat shit hurt 
So don't fuck around
But dat happen often off {IN RIVERDALE, GEORGIA}
You gon' pay the life you live, {OFF IN RIVERDALE, GEORGIA}
They gon' lay yo' ass out, rock you to sleep like a bay-baaay
Brick Squad shawty in the hood, we got the baaaaa-bies
Ever since they killed my nigga Travis
Start poppin pills and ackin craaaaa-zaaaay
Ever since they killed my nigga Travis
Start poppin pills and ackin craaaaa-zaaaay

[Chorus]

[Cap - Verse 3hree]
You know me nigga... (You know me nigga!)
I am the block       (BLOCK!)
It's Riverdale       (Shawty...) 
...and Waka Flock    (Flocka)
We got the glocks    (Glocks!)
Whips and the knots  (Knots!)
Even got the spots
SKERT~! SKERT~! Out the pots (Yeaaaaa)
Catch me in different states, bussin down bricks
Bussin down them bricks wit dat chick you fell in love wit (Ha!)
We on dat thug shit, give a fuck about love - I'm cruel, bitch!
Keep my money on my mind - not you, bitch!
Everyday shawty pull up in a NEW whip! (Haaah!)
In the trap, shawty said he need another one
Told 'em call Lil' Waka, he said, "What the FUCK you want?!"
Pull up in the dump, followed by a yellow one
So Icey, Feddi Gang, plus we keep them Tommy Guns
RAH!!
