[ PRELUDE: Unique ]
I wanna start this off different, not like the old one
Before the beat was fast, now it's a slow one
So I guess I'll have to change my style
It matters not to Great Unique because I'm versatile
My ingenuity enhances my ability to rhyme
Yo, you should know it, I'm a poet in his own time

[ VERSE 1: Unique ]
I been rappin since '77, I was 11
Breakin and brutalizin, sendin suckers to heaven
I never lost a battle, I very seldom had one
Cause in the outcome it was a sad one
It took a while for me to get well known
But now the king is here to swing cause he's on top of the throne
So make room for the searg', son, cause he's the large one
If everything was free I wouldn't charge none
But things are different, don't take your way home
Cause you'll be lost in the sauce of the Twilight Zone
And then Unique will smack you right back to reality, chump
Then find yourself as a bum and me as rich as Donald Trump
See all my lyrics are dope and beats are thick like molasses
Homeboy you're blind, so you better go get your glasses
Then take up a course in remedial rap classes
In other words what I'm sayin is I'm kickin asses
So ask yourself: Do I really wanna do this?
Knowin it in your heart that there is no way you can get through this
Cause I'm built like a China wall, and I will sign you all
Over to the authorities, but first I line you all
Up from the smallest to the tallest head
Because the bigger it is the faster it will go to bed
The way I rap is like I'm breakin down a plus degree
Since I'm your dad that means I have legal custody
So what are you talkin back for? You must be smokin crack, or
You're just a monster kid, so wouldn't you like a fractured jaw?
Besides I owe you one, so I'm gonna show you one
Chic technique, don't speak because I know you're done
Something that the aftermath will bring a repercussion
Case dismissed, there's no further discussion
So like I said before, catch up, you're behind
Cause I'm poet (cause I'm a poet) in his own time

[ VERSE 2: Unique ]
When Great Unique is on the set pump the volume up loud
Cause when I'm freakin you'll be thinkin I'm a part of the crowd
Because there's more than just a stage show, turn a page, so
We can continue, then you can let the rage flow
It's unleashed on those who oppose
Now they're froze from their toes to their nose cause they chose
To be different, exactly total opposites
But they all step aside when I'm droppin this
Bomb of harm dispersin toxic fumes
You make an ass out of yourself if you decide to assume
That the Great could be late cause I'm always on schedule
Put your money where your mouth is and I bet you will
Leave empty-handed, you'll be stranded
Disembodied, dispelled and disbanded
With this gift I can uplift your spirit
That's why I speak loud enough for you to hear it
But now it's time to show 'em, just write it in a poem
I'm blessed oh yes so I guess it's time to slow 'em
Down so you can catch every thing that I say
Cause what I do is a profession, not a thing for play
The microphone is like a heart and the rhymes are the brain
The beats is the blood and the mix is the veins
That's why the music makes the body move to the tempo
Last stop - I think this is the end, bro
So tell the world that Unique is def
Because Allah taught us right before he left
But I be back to kick another dope rhyme
Cause I'm a poet (cause I'm a poet) in his own time
