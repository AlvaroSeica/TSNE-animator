[Intro]
Uh, riiiight

[Smoke DZA]
I'm a loco, nigga straight loco
So think twice 'fore you cross my path, cause frontin on DZA's a no go
Uhh, I said a no go, told y'all niggaz is a Bozo
to go against my word just take it from me cause I know so
Uhh nigga no thought, bodied in the trap you get roped off
Call me Polo Young, nigga, this a motherfuckin Lo Sport
Kick that shit like none other, re-arrange a deal, need more mugga
Trying get drunk as a fish tonight, holler at my homeboy Joe Scudda
Straight shots I don't need no ice in it, got me talking reckless all night with it
All these old niggaz on Gotti dick, real life he ain't even like niggaz
Trying to be more like Bob Lemon, obsession with the flow let the beat ride
From the West to the Eastside
Light the sour &amp; bump this joint up in your G ride

[Chorus: ASAP Rocky] + (Smoke DZA)
Uh, I'm sittin high, I'm tippin slow
I'm gettin high, but I'm sippin slow
Mouth full of golds, nigga I got hella hoes
I'm that Harlem motherfucker with that mellow flow
"Comin down, sittin clean, mixin that Promethazine" {*4X*}
(Right)
(Purple... we Loko)
(Purple... we Loko)
(On purple... we Loko)
(Purple... we Loko)

[DZA] Uhhh

[Smoke DZA]
I'm a corporal, been around the globe you're a local
Niggas know your gaffe and we laugh at your ass
that you pass cause you're more like toll booth
Uhh, I thought I told you, you niggaz hard of hearin thought I told you
Uhh, there's some new niggaz eatin in the hood shit them other niggaz old news
We them new niggaz, clappin that strong whole crew stable
Me and my niggaz run this shit, coolest niggaz sittin at the cool table
Niggaz pop shit on the web, hide up in they crib cause they ain't able
'Til you GPS a nigga's crib, tell some niggaz where they live
like they worked for cable, but they 'bout that life
You niggaz ain't with it though, you know, who you foolin?
You know you don't smoke for real, why you tryin to reach for the doob?
What you doing? 'Til the next life, it's jet life, flyin high is luxury
Ain't shit changed, still George Kush, still need eight lungs to come puff with me

[Chorus]</pre>
