Sketchy, witness the relentless, the manhunt is tensin
The Tek left behind was printless
Narcs and Homicide, Feds and armoured rides
Hell se-la-cia, I'm vest up, armed to die
Forever will, glock shots, shoots to kill
So what the deal? Violate, feel the steel
The cleverest, so whoever slips
I'm roamin and holdin, terrorists born wit dis, gettin on wit dis
Makin moves while you fake moves, you and your frontin crews
Dressed pawnin jewels, livin in 6-2's
But now it's on, the end justifies the means
Lye smoke and CREAM, is all I fiend
It's in my genes, I float thru the streets and seen
In a tinted European and 50 coupe, it's green
Nothin in between, me and my team, we ill too
Respects due, oh I feel for you

We got this locked now, pure official, white crystal
The hypo get you before the snipe from the pistol
It's potent, just one whiff'll have you floatin
Hot and soakin, while I'm sellin, y'alls is smokin
Forever shinin, but strictly thru diamond's prominent
and dining with wealthy, old dime bitches rich as from cosignin
And Gold and American, Visa Charge-card, hold while I'm rollin
Affliated with hoes that is just bonin
So knowledge me, and analyse all of my qualities
You've crossed all apologies, my lifetime policy
Plus playin for keeps in these New York streets
It get deep so hold heat, and try and control your sleep
Cos umm, the life I live is deeper than the Mississippi Rivers
Me and my niggas only drivin what a ride give us
Puffin lye, gettin high til we die
So fuck it, whatever nigga try, violate and fry</pre>
