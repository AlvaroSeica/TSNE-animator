[Intro]
Ha ha, yeah!
Decay baby, Dat Squad!
Cool and Dre, it's homecoming
I'm hone now, bust out

[Travie McCoy]
I'm just an oxymoron in a song when I'm straight bent
Intoxicated on sobriety, irony makes sense
I'm tryin to make a livin, you dyin to pay the rent
Why you lyin for forgiveness when I ain't givin you shit?
My original plan was to live as a starvin artist but
Starvin artist die hungry, dress bummy
OMG, LOL, capital HEO
See a lot of 'em talk but half of 'em ain't paid
Truthfully, I +Walk it Out+ like Dre say
Bought my car on +106+ but now it's missin like +AJ+
I played it smart, put a little to the side
Bought a bar in New York, where I sit and swallow my pride

[Chorus]
I'm home, and they've been missin me since I've been gone
That's why your Mrs. been hittin me on my phone
Little man, had a plan, now he grown
Left you alone for too long sing the song maricon
I'm home, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home

[Interlude]
I'm home, I know I've been gone for too long
But I'm back, homecoming - ha ha~!
I know y'all missed me, don't even play
I'm home now though

[Travie McCoy]
I'm back, your boy did it, look how he shitted on 'em
He's like hard division, consider him a problem
Subtract me from the game, now that's a bad equation
Add the fact the industry's whack, now check your calculations
He's the equivalent of emcee squared
Multiplied by eight Kimbos, plain and simple
Round that to the nearest tenth L, it's just a waste of time
I'm stingy, I only make sense to myself
If wealth was the truth then that should by a man's happiness
Why the hell you think I'm smilin so hard while I'm rappin this?
Hay dios fuckin mio
The whole world got they eyeballs in my ijo
And that's why I keep the lies all close by
Cause currency is dirty, especially when you got it stacked miles high
They say money changed me, that's a no though
I just don't roll with bums, no hobo

[Chorus]

[Interlude]
Man, Gym Class Heroes is a real problem
You need to recognize that
Y'all was actin funny while I was gone
Now we back - ha ha, HAH~!

[Travie McCoy]
You tried livin in the fast lane but couldn't reach the pedals
Now your +So Called Life+ not as cool as +Jared Leto's+
I give this whole rap game a purple tonsil
Boom, now that's what you get for actin hostile
You can bite the hand that feeds you, but when it bites back
You gon' get +Arrested Development+ cuffs and cardiac
I'm in my prime, going harder than I should so
You little bastards takin orders like +Good Burger+
Spittin Snapple facts, that's nonsense
Read a couple books and you call yourself concious
The only reason I've been sleepin on music lately
cause y'all ain't makin nothin slightly close to entertaining
But that's entertaining, this is history
If you ain't on my level, don't even get at me
Literally, I am what you have been waiting for
Gym Class is now in session, you ain't gotta wait no more

[Chorus]

[Outro]
And there you have it, Gym Class Heroes baby
Decadence, Cool and Dre, dat squad
Oh-eight, AHHH~!
Fuck outta here</pre>
