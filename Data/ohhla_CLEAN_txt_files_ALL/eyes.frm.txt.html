[4 Bar intro]

[Verse One: Need Not Worry]
It was the Fall Semester, the 87 winter
skully with a leather jacket to get the picture
a back pack,psych class, heading home like that
public enemy inside the headphones...
took em off cus the batteries low
damn bro, yo its fuckin up the Chuck D flow
but the campus is crisp and he doesnt mind it
there's no snow yet, but its getting cold kid
hands in the pockets, smooth little groove
no tunes but he getting to his dorm room soon
when he caught a whiff of perfume
so refreshing, heard a couple footsteps just ahead of him
he try to catch up, prolly a cutie
with boobies, rockin little tight pants..booty....
nice, excuse me?? (who me) yes!
want a little company for walking home with

hook: 8 bars (would be nice to have juggaknot cuts) 
if so, I'ma have to re-write the hook around the cuts...
(if not....ima spit the hook similar to the version I had sent you)

[Verse Two: Need Not Worry]
Now we continue where they left off..just met.
now troopin, talking bout their lifestyle as students 
major/minor.. and everything thats in between
reader/writer...they chilling for the evening
they hit the spot...turned the lights on low..
and got comfy, knowing that its going real lovely
chattin, laughing while she trying on his kangol
little oversized for her so it hang low
music; soft, off with the shell toes
her tight jacket hit the floor but they went slow
little smootch right here,not going down there
no rush, both shy, don't touch
had enough? maybe not, maybe want more
but they stopped, then he walked her to her front door
a little kissy pooh, giggly euphoric
cus they know they gettin thicker than an oatmeal porridge

hook: 8 bars (would be nice to have juggaknot cuts) 
if so, I'ma have to re-write the hook around the cuts...
(if not....ima spit the hook similar to the version I had sent you)

[Verse Three: Need Not Worry]
as each day pass, they seemed to get a little closer
walking home from class together like they supposed tah
hand in a hand with her head upon his shoulder
friendship gone because the love has taken over
googley eyes, they'll be together forever
whenever they were together they were warmer than a sweater..
in winter,'91 asking her to marry him
she getting all emotional but laughing as she grabbin him
the perfect couple, last year on the campus
never had a question, their marriage had the answers
moving in together after graduation..
had to wait some, time for a demonstration
put their money on a house...no toys
no choice, year later had a healthy baby boy
happy daddy, good job..no lie
good kid, and a wife with eyes like blue skies

hook: 8 bars (would be nice to have juggaknot cuts) 
if so, I'ma have to re-write the hook around the cuts...
