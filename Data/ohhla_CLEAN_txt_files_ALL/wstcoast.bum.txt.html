[Verse One] [E-Vocalist]
Yo, I show no mercy, like Prince, I bring the controversy
Runnin' niggas off tracks like Jackie Joyner Kersee
The main component with raps that turn back opponents
I dunk foes like cops dunk Rachael's Donuts
I'm packin' led in the form of a #2 Pencil
I never slept cause payin' dues is essential
I
Got potential you can check my credentials
I'm known to get a piece of the rock like Prudential
But back in the day I was considered a heathen
Now I smother wack kids to make sure they'll never breathe again
I learned the ropes from an ex-con
I'm mellow like Seravon
With game like Farrakhan 
Yo check it
When my Oakland's style's dissected
My dialect is rough enough to make your girl get naked
I'll take your rough ass crew put them in Quincey &amp; Hecks
And if you piss me off I'll tap that ass like Sandman Sims
See I'm the roughed entertainer comin' straight from the west
And yes, I will agress in a battle or contest
The first B.U.M.
So I don't need an 'S' on my chest
I put more rappers in that +Gangsta Lean+ than D.R.S.

[Chorus] [x4]
"Now I'm gonna show you how the west coast smacks kids" - Souls Of Mischief 'That's When Ya Lost' 
"Boom boom bap boom bam" - D-Nice '25 Ta Life'

[Verse Two] [D-Wyze]
Who be the rapper grim reaper, sparks the blunt with the reefer
Pullin' back six thorough Micks slammed in my trunk
Who stands around me while the kid gets loose
I produce the kind of shit that makes the puss get juice
My vocal peaks makes the drums in your ears sleek
But wait a minute, let my man spin it while I speak
I got the gab to back crews off
For those who sweat my nuts and start to floss
? your crew behind your back you ain't shit (fuck 'em)
Blow all the noise and get the dick
You better believe I got a trick up my ass 
Press my button 
And I get live on the tracks and write rhymes while I'm fuckin'
"You're dirty kid!" Your damn right cause I'm D-Wyze
Caught me fuckin' Mother Nature then I spit in that bitch eye
Beats are broken down by The Baka Boyz butcher shop
D-Wyze crew is too live, I got 'em noddin' like hop
Purely pro, tight like a fresh bitch virgin twamp sack on the room
I cut the film like a surgeon
The author, kid with large eyes and nasty nucks
I grew up in east Oak so you know my life is fucked 
But who
Stands around me while the kid gets wreck on the mic all night?
Who you?
Yeah right

[Chorus] [x4]
"Now I'm gonna show you how the west coast smacks kids" - Souls Of Mischief 'That's When Ya Lost' 
"Boom boom bap boom bam" - D-Nice '25 Ta Life'</pre>
