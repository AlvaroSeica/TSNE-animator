Typed by: DaSun Akbar

(Chorus)
Welcome to the world young fella
You better bring your Steel Umbrella
Cuz the raindrops feel like fire
Fulfill your desire
Look in the mirror, you're the real Messiah
C'mon, look in the sky, and the sun ain't yella'
You better bring your Steel Umbrella
Cuz the raindrops feel like fire
Fulfill your desire
Look in the mirror, you're the real Messiah
C'mon...

[Chief Kamachi]
Who said life ain't supposed to be foul?
Starving, never stroll the grocery isle
Wipe the sweat from your brow
Grow stronger from denials and trials
Let your mind go a thousand miles
One loaf of bread can really feed a thousand mouths
Gotta learn the secrets in those old ancient files
Till than meet adversity with grace and smiles
Look in the mirror only put faith in thou
Can rule the world and just might take a while
Make a Covenant with God and don't break a vow
Naked souls, temptation then raped the child
Change the channel, Lucifer done broke the dial
Bought a brand new TV to watch the globe
No grass gon' grow, crack still cook on the stove
Went to the library, guess what book that he chose?
Wanna help him and every fucking crook that he knows

(Chorus)

[Chief Kamachi]
Ayo, thugging awhile, till I had a talk with Brother Bilal
You only achieve what your energy will allow
And you all high, walking with your head in the clouds
Half of your homies laying dead, covered in shrouds
Sit on your front porch, dopefiends huddled in crowds
Old lady eat cat food, it fuck with her bowels
It's so sad, picking in the trash for smiles
Feel helpless, walk on broken glass and vials
See the world change, we close to 2012
Can't stop the clock, in time it do tell
Would we ever see the face of the lamb?
At the golden gates, white robe embracing his hand
Make your own miracles happen, do what you can
Don't be depressed, you will find the power in man
Next thing you know, a lot of rich shower the land
Don't wait for things to change before making a plan
Eh?

(Chorus)

[Chief Kamachi]
Yeah, they say the end is near cuz the seasons is off
Black President they still don't believe in the laws
No jobs, but they steadily inflating the cost
Water or food, two choices making a toss
But the Government is promising spaghetti and sauce
But it's a black cat at every path that you cross
If you're not tested, how will you develop force?
You in misery, really need to get a divorce
Just look inside your soul and find a spiritual course
We want the fast life, Audubon, steering a Porsche
It's so ill, middle class living off oatmeal
Cuz strung out businessmen paying their coke bill
I see them in the hood on payday
It's crazy, but nowadays nothing really amaze me
Little girl is pregnant with Damien's baby
The shit you can't see cuz your third-eye is lazy
