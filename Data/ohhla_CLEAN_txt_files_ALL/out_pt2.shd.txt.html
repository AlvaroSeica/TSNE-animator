V1:
So I wrote this song once - out of love
About a scrub
In a crowded club or lounge
Surrounded by these hounds and thugs
And he goes home and he pouts because
Well first of all, his ears hurt from shoutin stuff
trying to flirt when the sound is up
so he already feels down and plus
he just got clowned and stuck out so many times
that now hes out of touch
well as the story goes, that boy never found his luck
sleeps in his folks' house
on the couch or just around the rug
legs spread starfish-style
mouth is up
singing - 'look out the window' and the blah-blah
loud as what
you know childish stuff
the things you do when youre lonely
but homies gotta be all proud and such
like 'we don't love them hos'
that's what they all say
still I seen many fall prey to a doll face
they sayin I ain't all straight
cuz dimes recognize me now in the hallway
and flash a smile, I pass em quick with a small wave
basically punk em so my boys get mad and punch me
in the junk til my balls ache

chorus:
look out the window and there's rainstorms
I let the wind blow out a brain storm (x3)

V2:
Shad's back on that emo tip
Oh good.
The scarf and the tight jeans complete the whole look
Why don't you go cook
Some vegan food and rent The Notebook
We all need a good cry shad, you so should!
Then maybe youll feel better
And wont put together another lame long love song
With no hook!
Go sniff a rose bush and learn how to rap again
I thought you got your flow back, what happened man
You had that super difficult, seven syllables at the minimal
a-typical schemes and you packed em in
now oyu slack and when you rappin, you have to grin
cuz you know that them rhymes is as wack as sin
and not half as dope as you had em then
shad dude, when was the last time you grabbed a pen
and worked your brains out, spat flames out
you tame now
sort of got this half-way lame style
and this is sort of an aside, but you've gained pounds
spending all day layed out on that same couch!
Whatever happened to 'I want a clair huxtable'
And 'the only rap videos I make are instructional'
I think you got a little bit too comfortable
And you still out of love, so what you gonna do...

(Chorus)</pre>
