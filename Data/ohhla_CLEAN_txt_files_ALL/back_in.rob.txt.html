[Lil Rob]
{"I'm back in the streets"}
Yeah, yeah I'm back in the streets man
{"And every girrrrrrrl that I meet"}
And every girl that I meet
{"They ask the same question"}
They're always askin me the same thing
{"And I tell them everytiiiiiiiiime.."}
And I tell them everytime, that I'm just gone for a while
But I'll always be back

I'm, back in the place where, we get so absurd
Liquor in a brown bag laid on the curb
Where a lot of good things and bad things occur
I know what time it is, homey what's the word?
I kick back on the valley with my eyesight blurred
All up in the alley, swiggin Thunderbird
Selling rocks on sidewalks, long walks to detox
A place where we creep don't sleep and we sweep the street blocks
Moox on the beats that make the streets, rock
I'm up in the corner hittin some grifa{?}
Spittin some game hopin to hit this weeza
Still in one piece and I'm back in the streets, I'm

[Chorus: Lil Rob] + {sped up samples}
{"I'm back in the streets"} I'm back in the streets
{"And every girrrrrrrl that I meet"} Every girl I meet
{"They ask the same question"} Always askin me
{"And I tell them everytiiiiiiiiime.."}
Just gone for a little while
But I'll always be back

[Lil Rob]
I'm, back on the calles, and I'm twice as bad
I still do the same thing, my bumper still drag
Lay it down on the ground right down on the ave
All my homeboys pass, see Lil Rob, got a brand new bag
Stuffin the cuff up, haters watch it watch it jump up
When I cruise by, everybody sayin whassup
Hey good to see you again - homey where you been?
I've been around the bend where I ain't got no friends
But, I'm back, in town and I love these streets
Brand new Nikes on my feet, walk on the concrete
Ey girl, I only leave cause I have to
And when I'm gone I'm thinkin I got streets to get back to, I'm

[Chorus]

[Lil Rob]
I, know every shortcut, I know every path
No matter where I go I know I'll be back
Anywhere on the map doesn't really matter where I'm at
I'll be on the Camino posted up, with my people
In a ragtop (yeah), pancake on the blacktop
Imagine this back drop, the lifestyle I can't stop
Heinas, homies, liquor and oldies
Can't leave the pad the hurras waitin for me
I'm buzzed and I'm on drugs - people ask me why I do it
And I tell 'em just because - it's just mari-huana
I do what I please, no need to be discrete
It just feels good, to be back in the streets, I'm

[Chorus] - 2X</pre>
