I was born into the goodness, graciousness of all mighty god
faced with temptations, lies, emphasize
war, weapons of destruction, mayhem
slaughter of the people, satan
worldly ways, godly ways, holidays, sorrow
no one is guaranteed tomorrow, yesterday was borrowed
picture perfect sunsets, ocean front
toxic waste dump, smog, clogged arteries
lotteries, rechargeable batteries
flattery, vanity, stars
jet propelled cars, men behind bars
murder, justice destruction
cats that quit, setups
politics, revenge
evidence, identity, plus agility
natural ability, idolatry, and chemistry
fear, friendship, enemies and energy
heat, humidities. crimes against humanities
carry these, harmonies, melodies and galaxies
trinities, remedies and memories are fallacies

I think I know too much! you don't know shit!
I think I know too much! you don't know shit!

I was born into the purest perfection of love of all mighty god
faced with the sword of the truth like a lightning rod
city, states, countries and all abroad
spacecraft all aboard
convoy are destroyed
books, tv, radio and telephone
records, phonographs, speakers and microphones
dance, cultural expression
unity, neighborhood community
youth and the elderly
parties, battles, skills and graffiti art
determination, reputation, strong and the weak at heart
gods, gangsters, griots and gigolos
kings, queens, bitches and silly hoes
money, cars, clothes and diamond rings
houses, horses, stock, the finer things
food, family, future, a purpose
knowledge, wisdom, understanding this circus
time, travel, audio and visual
creative adaptive, lonely individual
one nation under a groove, indivisible
mind, soul, spirit and the physical

I think I know too much! you don't know shit!
I think I know too much! you don't know shit!</pre>
