[Chorus] x4
So High, The time is 
So High, So High, So High
So High, The time is
H-A-Y slice the blunt, high grade shit (the time is)

[Project Pat]
you know I get high like Jamaican
light'cha blunts up, shot guns im takin
to the head dawg, break down the hydro
or some regular, it get'cha high tho
some of yall like to smoke the bad bitch
get the light green, but we like cabbage
get the razor slice down the optic-mo
my nigga, we bousta party
smokin weed to us is a hobby, eyes like chinese
smoke in my body, once im high mane
don't try to blow it, aint no passin
I must enjoy it, me and my dawgs gangsta and heavy
C and toby ride in that chevy, wit the tv's we we got
plenty
Dope ta smoke on, flashin on twen-ties

[chorus]

[Lord Infamous]
I love dope, dope loves me
Im high til I D-I-E
With a big bag of bud, and a bag of tooty too
I know that you get high too
As I cheaf, upon the leaf, of swisher sweet
The D the da da O the P the E
The C the da da O the K the E
I need the B da U the da da D
Uh, scarecrows a cloud of smoke, Always on the thunder
Puffin on the paper cus white ?? marijuana
I stay fucked up, on a daily basis
Maybe the reason I got all these cases
Extacy orange juice make me me so horny
Super pimp coked out coked out til the morning
Hydro coats on sniff snoff as I sniff sniff 
Come let Lord Infamous take a wiff
