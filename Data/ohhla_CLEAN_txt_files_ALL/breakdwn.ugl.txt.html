Whooo-wee! Alright, breakdown
Break it down!~!

Uh-huh... I like that! Check it out

[Verse One]
It's, not, easy bein Ugly
Comin up hopin that people would love me
As a kid in some cheap sneakers and a backpack
Try to make a friend and you end up gettin laughed at
(Ha ha!) When I try to fit with the clique
or pick up a chick, I felt like I'd been hit with a brick
Cause all I'd ever get was chills from a cold shoulder
Thinkin this'll all change when I grow older
Move to today and it's still the same
As I try to make a "Bang" in this hip-hop thang
See, all I want to do is just rock the mic
Then I heard there's a jam goin off tonight
So I'm knockin... I can't get in
I'm knock, knockin but I can't get in
I'm knock knock knockin but I can't get in
And I can hear the party is about to begin

[Chorus]
You won't unlock this door
Well what are we gonna do - BREAK IT DOWN!
You want to close us out
Well what are we gonna do - BREAK IT DOWN!
You want to build this wall
Well what are we gonna do - BREAK IT DOWN!
You'll have to watch it fall
Cause what are we gonna do - BREAK IT DOWN!
Woooooooooo~! {"right, r-right on"}
Woooooooooo~! {"go nuts"}
You, can't, stop us now
We, will, break you down
YOU, CAN'T, STOP US NOW

[Verse Two]
RRROUGH...
Now I'ma break it down like the Berlin Wall
And give it all I got until the curtain call
Einstein, Andy and I, started this group
to get back to the roots and rock retarded loops
Now here's the scoop - we got signed in '99
Two LP's, performin overseas
Show after show we'd be takin the stage
Straight gettin no sleep, makin minimum wage
Beggin for support from the labels and the press
But they'd look right past us and be like "NEXT!"
They said the sound won't make it today
They don't wanna hear what we're tryin to say
So we're knockin... but we can't get in
We're knock, knockin but we can't get in
We're knock knock knockin but we can't get in
And we can hear the party is about to begin

[Chorus]

WE, WILL, BREAK YOU DOWN!!
Uhh, yeah
One more time break it down!
