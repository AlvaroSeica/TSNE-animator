[Intro: Girl (5 Foot Hyper Sniper)]
Ninja habitat (bring the trauma)
Ninja habitat (bring the trauma)
Ninja habitat (bring the trauma)
Ninja habitat (bring the trauma)

[K-Blunt (5 Foot Hyper Sniper)]
Yo, check the joint, son
Yo, yo, now, bring it back, baby
One time for the Brooklyn Zu
{Ninja habitat} (bring the trauma)
Bring it back one time for the Brooklyn Zu
{Ninja habitat} (bring the trauma)

[K-Blunt]
Dreams of the dreaded drug dealer gettin' drawn back
That's kind of drastic and dreary, I don't like that
That's why I drink til I'm drunk, don't know how to act
Some get prowls in the ground, catch a heart attack
I got destroys from the past, so I'm the true legend
Shining bright, never dull, like those that dwell in heaven
Of all the beings in the universe, I'm the worst
Sometimes I apoligize to my mom, when I curse
Beat drops, making you shake your hips and hop
Sixty four tracks, runaway train, non-stop
Looking at my watch, 12 o'clock, on the dot
Rushin' to the block, so I could sell these rocks
Smoke cess, smuggle on slave ships, from foreign soils
To my lips, had to hittin' horny hoe's with hips
She's bangin' bangin', like Buddha Monk's beats
On our streets, Brooklyn bound, never face defeats
Now you know, why I'm the one to entertain
It's K-Blunt, scream it loud, say my name

[Chorus: Girl (5 Foot Hyper Sniper)]
Ninja habitat (bring the trauma
Eat your ass like Jeffrey Dahmer
Universal unibombers, comma, we heat that ass like saunas
Karma, oops, son, we bring the trauma)
Ninja habit (bring the drama
Eat that ass like Jeffreyy Dahmer
Universal unibombers, comma, we heat that ass like saunas
Karma, oops, son, we bring the trauma)
Ninja habit, muthafuckas!

[5 Foot Hyper Sniper]
My life struggle, is how I like to couple, who can't get caught
Be on the double with my hustle, I bust you
Got to, Cash Rules Everything Around Me, get the CREAM
And get an eight fifty, let it beam, check my team
We all scheme for diamonds, golds, and rings and things
And put, where mathematics is the verdict
Like Rapper Noyd, I'm seatin' 'pon unlawly, leaves a permanant score
That's the Iron's Eagle Claw, cuz I seek to understand the bond cuz a cureable

[Popa Chief]
It takes a strong knowledge, see, to hold down the foundation
Constant Elevation, I run the whole plantation
Daily expanding, my reservation
Sitting on top of the world, looking down at my creation
The globetrotter, world traveler, Supa Ninja
Raise the roof, is a ball burner
A wise dred bluntly said, hold ya head
Therefore I take this roll like a moped
I keep the best part and out with the trash
And catch wreck like a twenty car crash
Rip a show, get the dough, do the dash
Putting niggas in the full body cast
Cuz I ain't got time, to be sitting around, waiting for miracles
I build with Spiritual, a/k/a Killa Constable
Fuck that happy shit, Buddha Monk's the first nigga to spark shit
And the Manchuz killed it
That's it, that's all, period, end of story
The Ninjaz out for the same and the glory

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
