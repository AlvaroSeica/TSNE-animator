[Intro: Andre 3000 "Elevators" sample]
"True I got more fans than the average man but not enough loot to last me"
"to the end..."

[Apathy]
I'm tryin to read between the lines, show me how the war's won
"Rich Dad Poor Dad," I just had the poor one
Call me Charlie Bucket, attitude is fuck it
No golden ticket so I'm ballin on a budget
And rap money's bullshit, nothin like it used to be
I used to be used to G's, blew through them foolishly
And fuck a nine-to-five, I live life for rockin these mics
The only time I wake up early is for court dates and flights
I'm livin check-to-check, but I ain't talkin Nikes
I'm leakin money like BP with oil pipes
It's funny how it makes you feel like you ain't a man
Tryin to justify why you makin payment plans
I never made it cause I never tried to make you dance
I'm makin ends meet, while Diddy's makin bands
I wanna thank my fans, the ones who show respect
I'm like projects in Prague livin Czech to Czech

[Chorus]
"To the end of the week, I live by the beat like you live check to check" {*3X*}
"If you don't move yo' foot then I don't eat, so we like neck to neck"
"To the end of the week, I live by the beat like you live check to check" {*2X*}
"If you don't move yo' foot then I don't eat, so we like neck to neck" {*2X*}

[Apathy]
I never drink on some bitch, cause drinking's for the weak
The only way I make it rain is cause Ev' did this beat
I'm sittin in my car reclined back in my seat
Phone's about to get shut off and I ain't even eat
I'm waitin so long for a check from a song
by the time I get to cash it every penny of it's gone
Gone baby gone, I'm tryin to stay strong
If it wasn't for my family and my friends I wouldn't be around this long
Like me and Louie used to live off only Little Debbies
Cause they only cost a quarter, can't afford a penny more
to get a value meal, wish somebody woulda taught me how to deal
But I ain't talkin about trees or ki's of blow
I never knew how to be responsible with my dough
I radiate bein broke, you almost see me glow
I'm the Incredible Hulk of blowin money for show
And so I rock the show to make my empty pockets grow
I'm contemplatin changin jobs if the money's better
Cause makin paper off rap now's "Tougher Than Leather"
I love music forever but we can't stay together
I told myself I'd never ever ever ever ever

[Chorus]</pre>
