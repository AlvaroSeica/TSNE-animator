Typed by: AZ Lyrics

ets go ziggy now them a pray for the riches and the gold
but won't even pray for them soul ziggy

I hear you wanna try to find it do you know what it is
I hear you gone looking for what you want hope you find what you need
I hear you gonna try and find it do you know what it is
I hear you gone looking for what you want hope you find what you need

Not all that glitter is gold once a fool was told
Right before he sold his soul his soul
and a man made his money His money was on his mind
He got everything he wanted and he still wasn't satisfied

How you feel when you look in the mirror do you see a champion or a weakling
What's your thing what you chasing falsehood or fatherhood
Abandonment of parenthood I'm looking for something good
There's something bout the way you act the way you play the game
I love you smile and you don't look at life quite the same
Your attitude kinda make me want to really change
Look at things not the same but differently
You the best the worst of me the reverse the opposite of me
Your hospitality got me feeling quite free

Sitting in front of the big screen watching life go by
Wanna be like what you see every time you close your eyes
She's coming in from the cold she cant stand to be alone
He's looking for a hole what she needs is a home

Hope you find what you need hope you find what you need

A religious man is preaching. Said he found god
But he couldn't go to heaven until he found love
The people they are listening he caught them by surprise
He Confessed all his sins and he stop telling lies

I hear you wanna try to find it do you know what it is
I hear you go looking for what you want i hope you find what you need
I hear you gonna try to find it do you know what it is
I hear you go looking for what you want hope you find what you need

Hope you find what you need

Hey yo push come to shove what happen to the love
What happen to the giving instead of taking my heart is breaking
To many greedy not giving to the needy
What happen to the pity when you walk through the inner city
Now where the love at where the hugs at
Nowadays everybody want to be a thug act
Too many materialistic ways and nowadays nobody love each other the same way

Everyone's trying to find it Do we know what it is
hear we go looking for what we want I hope we find what we need
Everyone's trying to find it Do we know what it is
I hear we go looking for what we want I hope we find what we need

I Hope you find what you need hope you find what you need

One time and if the blind lead the blind then wha go happen to the whole mankind
You nuh know me say hope you find what you need

Ziggy ziggy ziggy and heavy heavy heavy and Ziggy Ziggy Ziggy them no ready ready</pre>
