Song:   Reba (Two Worlds Collide)
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Andy]
Oh, it's been a long time coming
Two of the world's greatest
America's Sweetheart, Reba McEntyre
([Kenan] Yeah, yeah, how you doin', Andy?)
We 'bout to take it to the top
Hit 'em, Reba

[Kenan]
Haters in my face
Try to keep me down
But you know we keep on shining
([Andy] Here we go!)
Two big stars from opposite worlds

'Bout to set this track on fire
([Andy] Yeah, she's the queen of country)
He's a comedy prince
Makin' something out of nothing
([Andy] We hooked up in the studio to make this song!)
But as usual we ended up fucking
([Andy] No doubt!)

[Andy]
Flashback to when I first met Reba
Sitcom dressing room, puffing on cheeba
I said I was a fan, she said "groovy"
Dropped her denim skirt and said, "hop to it"
Made love all night ([Kenan] More like we fucked!)

Kids banging on the door, trynna interrupt
But them autographs can wait
'Cause this is way too strong
I can't leave it alone
Because her pussy's the bomb

[Kenan]
Well my pussy is the bomb and that's a fact
But these n-words keep on tripping
([Andy] Okay!)
So I stay on my grind and drop these hits
'Cause I can't go back to stripping (I'm Reba!)

([Andy] You're my undercover freak)
And you're my best friend, but our families don't approve
([Andy] That's right 'cause I'm a city boy)
And I'm a country girl
And I'll never leave your sweet balls blue

[Andy]
Ay, because a girl like Reba's got just what I need
With big, broad shoulders and a red ass weave
([Kenan] And a penis)
Hot damn, she fly
All she wanna do is fuck me
I'm a lucky guy
([Kenan] I'm a guy too)

My friends think I should dump her
They say she's a man who found a wig in a dumpster
([Kenan] Your friends are smart)
Naw, Rebs, they're just jealous
'cause I'm dating a star instead of hanging with the fellas
([Kenan] Hanging like my nuts)
Word up, they're just liars
They can't believe that I could pull Reba McEntyre

[Kenan]
Since I came out my mama's butt
I knew I was destined for greatness
I looked in a dumpster and saw a wig
And thought, "hey brother, I'm gon' take this"
([Andy] Tell 'em, Reba!)
So I put it right on and took a stroll
Right over to 30 Rock
([Andy] SNL!)
I saw Andy Samberg and he thought I was Reba
And I made him suck my dirty cock

[Andy]
So there you have it
Two worlds collide
We the new Bonnie and Clyde
([Kenan] Reba!)
From haystacks to Maybachs, our love will survive
For Reba I ride, 'til the day that we die
([Kenan] I'm Reba!) </pre>
