Verse 1:

Hey ho, hey ho
Southside gon' hold
Its candy coat on my toes
As a park the rolls(royce)
And open up the door
Shining marble floors
Love seat full of hoes
52- inch playstation with some 9-9 Teken
Anotha' L.P. they tell me this boy still wreckin'
Ain't no time for flexin'
I just washed the jag
Meet me at the studio nigga poppin the deck
Bumping 5th ward to they murdered off
Illegal serve em' off
While they hating
I'm debating
Thats disturbing my cause
Now wanna par-lay for later
Black and grey navigator
Round some tickets if you wit' it
Jay and face in Jamacia
Now later player-hater
Just for bumping his gums
Started off with nine short
Slanging two for one
But my job ain't done til' i go world wide
And have em' all body-rocking, which side wanna ride?


(Do you wanna ride with the southside?
 Eastside gon' ride
 Do you wanna ride with the southside?
 Westside gon' ride
 Do you wanna ride with the southside?
 Northside gon' ride
 Do you wanna ride with the southside?
 Southside worldwide!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Verse 2;

I bring the noise  unnn  when i pop my trunk
Customized with the glass banging southside funk
Blowin' hunks of the skunk til' the cab smoke out
Ridin' hot 
Til' we die with the glock on cock
Always peeping 
Never sleeping 
Man these boys a get cha' 
Pickin' the wrong time the wrong place and wrrong picture
Butl I ain't bout trippin'
Fool I'm all about my chips
Stacking them grips
Big ol' pimp on the southside flip
By the club
Where dem' girls 
And dem' thugs show love
Pop' trunk leave em' rough
Throw em' back the dust
Keeping it true
Jamming screw
Slowwing it down three notch
Got a crib off the hill
And a yacht by the dock
Off the beach laying bone to some yellow-tone skin
Next to my AMG  600 with rims
Pop a pill
Stack a mil'
It' our time to ride
If you boys representing just ride with the southside


(Do you wanna ride with the southside?
 Eastside gon' ride
 Do you wanna ride with the southside?
 Westside gon' ride
 Do you wanna ride with the southside?
 Northside gon' ride
 Do you wanna ride with the southside?
 Southside worldwide!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Verse 3:

Take a ride
On the side
Where the weather stay dry
Poppers ride plenty deep 
Behind the shit that you drive
As I creep the scene I peepin' these so called friends and hoes
Lousiana nigga with the capability to fuck many hoes
And yours too
Wach me ride through
These streets fall and die
They he lit wit' cho' bitch on the passenger side
Hit the switch, trunk rise
Ganster white-wall tires
Sunshine blind eyes on my candy-coated prise
But my pride can't be tied to no item you purchase
Cause in the long run
When you gon' son
That shits all worthless
Valet service got em' nervous
When we hit the scene
Haters gream, blowing steam
Cause we stepped out cream
My team 15 deep
????? and suites
Limousine real cheap
So check the V.I.P.
Hit the club rush the boy for the stars i'm jetting
Now which side wanna ride with the shop thats wrecking
I-10 connected

(Do you wanna ride with the southside?
 Eastside gon' ride
 Do you wanna ride with the southside?
 Westside gon' ride
 Do you wanna ride with the southside?
 Northside gon' ride
 Do you wanna ride with the southside?
 Southside worldwide!!!!!!!!!!!!!
