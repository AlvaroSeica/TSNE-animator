[Intro]
Smoke, Ty Beats

[Verse One: Spaceghost Purrp]
Back in this bitch mothafucker yeah it's me
Spaceghost Purrp and I put yo' bitch to sleep
Me and my twin at it again with this funk
Sipping on gin, living in sin, lean in the trunk
R.I.P. to Screw, rest in peace to Pimp, C
Shout out to the H and that fuckin S.U.C.
My fuckin brain is purple, nigga

[Chorus]
Everything is purple (swag)
Everything is purple... (swag, swag, swag) "I said"
Everything is purple (swag)
Everything is purple... (swag, swag, swag)

[Verse Two: ASAP Rocky]
It be that pretty motherfucker sippin that throwed
Grippin my pistol, my chrome
Hittin to hit you then splittin yo' wig into somethin
I spit it and flip it like +Bone+
Niggas ain't ready for the flow switch
Only Harlem nigga on his +Bone+ shit
Tippin Vogues since, back in oh-six
Ain't you see a nigga gettin throwed, bitch?
Two middle fingers to the show, bitch
Cause they selfish in the showbiz
Cause they show kids and it's hopeless
Career dying quicker than a cold fish
(I be that fly young fella, Maison Martin Margiela)
(Bitches Cinderellas under my umbrella, I go and tell her)

[Chorus]

[Verse Three: ASAP Nast]
All hail here, bitches Satan talkin
Told her to take it off, give me the D she take the offense
Skinny nigga ballin, trip but never fallin
Who said to make it rain? Bitch I make it pourin
I'ma cake-o-saurus, go study my nature
Big chain on me like Treach from Naughty by Nature
Fuck what you sayin, away
A hater don't faze a gangster
Brought up in danger, all about paper
Smokin on purple, bitch I'm dangerous
Nasty, crazy 90's baby, momma I made it
Up to the sky, goodbye to the pavement
Hoes get caught in amazement
I'm stuck in my ways
So fuck 'em up, fuck 'em and duck 'em for days
What more can I say? I'm chasin this paper
That's purple, nigga</pre>
