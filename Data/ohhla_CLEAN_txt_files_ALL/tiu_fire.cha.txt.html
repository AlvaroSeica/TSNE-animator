[Chamillionaire]
Yeah, it's the name they say is running the game
Chamillitary Mayne, yeah so go ahead and hand over the torch
Super producer Scott Storch, and of course...

[Chorus: Chamillionaire]
I'ma show you how to get your shine on (get your shine on)
Turn it up, the DJ playing my song (my song)
Everybody keep on calling my phone (my phone)
Which one of y'all am I gone take home? (take home)
I'ma show 'em how to get the club crunk (get the club crunk)
Give 'em something that's gon' rattle their trunk (rattle that trunk)
Tip ya cups up until ya get drunk (get drunk)
Tell the DJ to play it loud and turn the beat up

[Chamillionaire]
Give me that million-dollar beat and let me show you what to do with it
Who that is? That's the illest rapper chopped and screwed on it
Couldn't snatch the game that's what they told me so I'm provin it
Put the truth in Texas with Scott Storch and you got you a hit
Hit and never miss, rep your click and throw 'em high
Because Chamillionaire's the answer to the game like Allen Eye
Middle fingers to the sky if they don't like their reply
Cause any DJ that deny is a motherf#*kin liar
So give the ladies what that want, got 'em racing to the front
of the stage to feel the bass and tell the DJ turn it up (turn it up)
Yeah, Sound of Revenge, send Universal to get my plaques
Rap is dead so I'ma bring it back like DJ's do when they hear my tracks
Check out my track record, they'll say I'ma track wrecker
Hotter than a black pepper now that I am back nigga (he's back!)
You can't get mad if you feel that shoe and cap fit ya
Drop the biggest stats ever so don't let that blat hit ya

[Chorus: Chamillionaire]

[Lil' Flip]
Ay, ay, when it's time to hit the club I let my chain hang
If they got clovers on they neck we in the same gang
I'm twenty deep in V.I.P. puffing Mary Jane
Splinters still in my hand from my woodgrain
I got homies on the West who like to gangbang
And I got homies on the East who do the same thang
I told Johnny put fifty in my panky rang
Five karat diamond chain, VVS is in it mayne
You know I rep the Dirty Dirty where they move 'caine
You know we mix purple stuff in that blue drank
Hypnotic, big bodies with blue paint
We got Big Oomp Spray, but it still stank
You a lame so your dame playing mind games
I'm a pimp so I stay in that mind frame
Niggas talk shit until I let the nine bang
Me and duke in that Maybach switching lanes

[Chorus: Chamillionaire]

[Chamillionaire]
I'm headed to the bar (I'm headed to the bar)
You know I'm V.I.P. (you know I'm V.I.P.)
And since you rolling with a star (your rolling with a star)
Your V.I.P. with me (Chamillitary Mayne)

Chamillitary the biggest threat to any of these rappers that think they doing it
Who that is? That's them boys from Texas that always do it big
Multi-colored diamonds got us shining, they say our jewellery sick
Houston got a problem and you don't want nothing to do with it
Do you kid? I ain't think, I'm tipping slow
When my trunk is lifting up look at the neons as they glow
Groupies never giving up, they be everywhere I go
When that elevator go up to my suite they there fo' sho'
Told me that she didn't care about my money, wasn't hearing it
Looks can be deceiving as Chamillion paint appearances
You know how we do it at home of Screw and purple syrup is
She got turned out quicker than my power steering did

[Chorus: Chamillionaire]

[Chamillionaire]
Ay man, you got some fifteens in your trunk, turn the volume up!
If you got some tens in your trunk, turn the volume up a little louder mayne
It's going down, it's King Koopa the Man on Fire
Live and direct from the streets of Houston Texas
Invading the airwaves with the official Chamillionaire mixtape powered by Fear Factor Music
We about to get into another world premier right here
You already know how DJ Smallz and Chamillitary do it mayne
Exclusive, let's hit 'em</pre>
