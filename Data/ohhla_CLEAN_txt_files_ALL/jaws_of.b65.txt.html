I used to march around the playground with my friends
Yelling we hate girls and now all's well that ends well
And there's so much to be said for fresh starts and second chances
In a world of scary monsters and high tech advances
I try to do what I do with love instead of with anger
And when sometimes I bite my nails 'cause real life is a cliffhanger
What with only seconds left at the end of the 10th hour
We got emergency ways to respond to the Nth power
The alloys are light weight and increasingly durable
But as far as I'm concerned, the original is preferable
I'm stubborn that way, I piss while humanity waits
My motto wouldn't fit on a set of vanity plates
The watch in my pocket maybe indeed old and tarnished
But at least I can raise my hand without a shoulder harness
You know I can easily replace my lungs with a respirator
My ?pants? with a DV and my staircase with an escalator
But my life revolves around the spherical orbit of earth
And it ends forever with the miracle moment of birth
On the first day of spring, I start work on the fall edition
And decide for myself who's a thief and who's a politician
It's two different things on different pages of the calendar
I gauge the way I react on the age of my challengers
I row my boat gently against the current and I believe
In real life and death experience and keeping and even keel

What's that Dim, Stop that racket (2X)
Damn that noise, I'll kill them all</pre>
