One for the money, two for the hoes
Three for more money - cause what else is there?

One for the money (yup) two for the hoes (that's right)
Three for more money - cause what else is there?

Yo don't player hate me, or my tray to (?)
We stay at Super 8's and break-fast at Denny's
Son we run thick in Hunt Club-ness and short sets
You best know we roll with blue metallic tint glasses by Revco
Me and the bros go out mackin slick in matchin tracks kicks
Unable to fail, when sippin on Champail and Schlitz
Mad hits on the Gold Star beeper by my hip set
The crib got Cecil Vinyl slipmats (what?)
It's a fact my brothers do rock, the tri-colored tube socks
This crew grubs on fine Aston Food Club
Washin it down with Fresca, Realistic deck soundin fine
Blastin through the speakers by Sound Design
Charlie Red in the air; this hustler fiends for Rustler jeans wear
Peeps stare at my Foto Pass and Gold Tone effects
Rollin in, Yugos, Sprint Turbos and Chevettes
The type of hoes I impress hair be smellin like Flex

[repeat 4X]
One for the money, two for the hoes
Three for more money - cause what else is there?

WHAT?!</pre>
