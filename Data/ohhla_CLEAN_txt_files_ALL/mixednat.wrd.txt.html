(Sons of Scotland)

I'm the Kilt the haggis tamed from a savage
The excess baggage of UKÂ’s Marriage
The English they had us after the carnage
Made us UK now the whole flags tarnished
(Union Jack) What the fuck is that?
Are one country or just one thats cracked?
Are we free as a nation to make our path?
Or follow on the road of a systems thats
Not ours (no no) no power
Sheep to the wolf once wolf turned coward
Yeah and whats your flower
Rose or thistle or does it not matter
(Shit) Then it speaks for itself
And you cant speak less you be in the wealth
Yes we are being ourselves
Scotland murder drugs poor health

Its English Irish Pakistan
Polish Spanish Iraqi man
From Italy China Oz Japan
This is Scotland mate this is who I am [x2]

This is Scotland (aye) this is who we be
A land of so much fuck BNP
You be nothing pricks thats been never proud
To stay in time that we live right now
This is 09 no time for the old times
Feel right at home with the Nazi's in war crimes
I dont know why you cunts want to draw lines
Not for your national pride cause I got mine
And I find that this place is amazing
Indian Asians black and Caucasian
All people stay in Scotland the brave yin
A mixed nation dont mind me saying

Its English Irish Pakistan
Polish Spanish Iraqi man
From Italy China Oz Japan
This is Scotland mate this is who I am [x2]</pre>
