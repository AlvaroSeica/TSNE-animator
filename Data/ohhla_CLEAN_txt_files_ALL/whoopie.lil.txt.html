Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Nigga came with this, niggas came with that
Dog I got that crack, dog I got that food
What you need nigga slangin off the cheaper prices
Your prices wack my prices priceless
I would drive 7 seas for that heavy duty, real hustlas know stuff it in her booty
I don't play games, and I don't say names
I'm not a teacher, I'm Ron Artest
Serve the whole crowd, win the championship
I'm Doug Flutie with an assault rifle
I'm Larry Bird, with and half a bird
Like Churches chicken, do you have some nerds
Niggas think I fell of I was working 60, Never had a charger but my gun's a hemmy
Lamborghini bitch I feel like john test, classical music, classical bitch
All the girls hate you, like you're Marvin sickness.
All my bitches love me, like morning breakfast
I'm like the eggs, you're like the plate
You hold me up, while I sit in cheese
Juvenile bitch, my bullets 400 degrees
Niggas think√ø they big shot Well, take out his knees
I don't wanna be the guy that no one's respecting
Fuck respect bitch, I'll be the one you're neglecting
Heavy duty bullets, call of duty black ops, becuase I'm in the bushes
I bought a bitch and a bought a new xbox
I bought a new range, copped the red flame, download blue flame
Shotgun in the trunk, for the player hatas, bitch I'm Forest Gump
Bitch I'm Mandela, nigga full nelson
All my bitches Helen Keller, they can't see you niggas
But they still shoot, that gun forever
I got money in the safe, cause I'm paranoid
2 guns in my waist cause I will destroy, no mask on my face cause I'm in idiot
Bring the gun to his house, make him sleep with it
Selling off thangs, I'm Barbra Walters
This is a vest... I lay you in that coffin, Lil B the God
This is toy soldiers, nigga fuck around with me bitch don't think I told ya
Evil Red Flame Bitch, This is toy soldiers, nigga fuck around with me bitch don't think I told ya</pre>
