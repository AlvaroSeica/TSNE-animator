[Trey Songz]
Damn, I'm so hungry
Plus I'm layin
What time is it?
I'll tell you what...
It's 5 o'clock in the morning
and the club is over
Shawty let's go get our grub on
I had way too much to drink
and I need to get sober
So, let's go get our grub on
Baby let's get out of here
I know a place not far from here
that I can get that grub on
Said my stomach's growlin so crazy
would you please feed me baby?
Girl let me get my grub on
No cheese steak or grits...
I don't have a taste for that
I don't want pancakes or bacon...
I don't have a tatse for that
Girl I want something fulfilling
that's gon fill my appetite
Girl you're the only one that can make it alright

[Chorus]
Will you be my IHOP baby?
Can I place my order?
The food in here is crazy
Twenty-four hours
'Round the clock you open
Baby here's a tip:
You hop on top of me
I hop on top of you

[Trey Songz]
I'm thinking 'bout going for seconds
maybe some dessert, Yeah
I'm still tryna get my grub on
And when I taste ya coffee
with sugar and cream
This spot is where I belong, oh...
Cake and whip cream so divine
I could eat here all the time
Is there a doggy bag I could take home?
Tellin you if you ain't tasted
think you better call your waitress
Cuz IHOP's open 'til the early morn
No fruitcakes, no salads...
I don't have a taste for that
Lookin for a meal with a balance
Something that can satisfy me
Girl I want something fulfilling
That's gon take care of my cravings
So girl tell me can you feed me?

[Chorus]

[Trey Songz]
I like that blueberry syrup
I like that strawberry syrup
Now baby lay your body down
and let me lick it all up
Now baby let's get you seated
Don't need a plate to, whoo!
Get a good meal
let me show you girl it's real
But it's gon be just me and you
We gon grub 'til we full
So tell me it's cool

[Chorus] - 2X

[Trey Songz]
Now gimme that rootie-tootie
that fresh &amp; fruity
that, that, that big ol' booty
Now come and do me
Grub on
grub on...
Grub on
grub on...</pre>
