[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
I had a dream that the whole world was starin at me
I woke up and wasn't no one there, wasn't no one there , yeah eh eaah
Same song to a different beat
Cause really sometimes I feels like I'm the only one there
I guess nobody cares, hey
But everythings good 'til it goes bad
And you gon' tell all the people about the fun you used to have
It hurts when it don't last, no easy way sayin bye
So I'm a spread my wings,  head for the sky

[Chorus]
And I fly solo, and I fly solo
And I fly solo, and I fly solo
And I...

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa] 
I'm tired of bein tired
And dealin with your BS, all the while supplyin
The money for your request, without me you're a dime
But with me you're a buck fifty, haha
I can get another one quickly, but I'd rather wade it out
Take the broken pieces try and fix it
Or you could let your pride over weigh the right decision
And I'll be in the sky you can pay your boy a visit
Ha

[Hook]

[Chorus] Â– repeat 2x

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa] 
Remember what you said
But what you say to me ain't guaranteed to always be the Gospel
I was doin good way before I met you, now you're off the set
And I'm a let you see the show go on without you
Take a bow....think about it
And hopefully we could be friends but I really doubt it
See you be catchin feeling's now and I be catchin planes
The story of my life, you're just another page

[Chorus 2] 
But everythings good 'til it goes bad
And you gon' tell all the people about the fun you used to have
It hurts when it don't last, no easy way saying bye
So I'm a spread my wings, head for the sky
And I fly solo, and I fly solo
And I fly solo, and I fly solo
And I...

[Outro] 
I had a dream that the whole world was starin at me (starin at me)
I woke up and wasn't no one there (no one there)
Yeah eh eaah</pre>
