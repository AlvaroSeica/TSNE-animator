[Sample taken from "Take Some Time" by Ndugu &amp; Chocolate Jam Co.] (Badu)
Take some time to let your feelings flow free 
(Take some time to let your feelings show) {What we gon' do right here is go back}
Let your FEELINGS flow free...
You can't hide away from what you need, yeah...
(You can't hide, you can't hide) {...way back}
Search the skies, a new horizon
(Sky's the limit, lemme really know)
A new horizon to unfold
Set yourself on the oceans of dreams to behold
(You can't hide, you can't hide)

[Verse 1]
Come down baby let me know 
Umm hmm
I love how you make me feel
Umm hmm
Let's jump off into your world
Umm hmm
Hearts lead baby, it's your deal
Umm hmm
Thump, thump, I've been here before
Umm hmm
Don't cheat, I been taking score
Umm hmm

[Chorus: sample taken from "Take Some Time" by Ndugu &amp; Chocolate Jam Co.] (Badu)
Take some time to let your feelings flow free 
(Take some time to let your feelings show) 
Let your FEELINGS flow free...
You can't hide away from what you need, yeah...
(You can't hide, you can't hide)
Search the skies, a new horizon
(Sky's the limit, lemme really know)
A new horizon to unfold
Set yourself on the oceans of dreams to behold
(You can't hide, you can't hide)
