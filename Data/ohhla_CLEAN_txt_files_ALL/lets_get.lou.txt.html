[Louis Logic - Talking]
Huh, yeah 
Yo, yeah, yo, yo!

Follow the sounds of the drunken dragon
and just imagine recoverin' alchies, jumpin' from the wagon (Look out!)
Someone's staring in that your mom knows
as "The King Of Put Downs" and "Most Ignorant Snot Nose"
Who got flows, much liver
than a 2Pac show? A drug wired truck driver's on caffeine pills
My nasty spills surpass the thrill
of the change to chill in bed with two muff divers
Fuck a Budweiser, I'd rather taste the geyser
of JÃ¤germeister squirtin' out a stripper's shaved vagina
What a way to find an artist, waiting for the show to start
Don't snooze, punk, there were two drunks on Noah's Ark
Throwing darts in Jehovah's bar, sippin' smooth rum
scheming on how to stick the only chickens who would come
You bet your ass if Lou was born I would've had 'em both
Super drunk on Jack and Cokes and crash the boat

[Chorus: Louis Logic] + (J-Love)
Ayo, J!
(What's going on, Lou?)
Let's get it started
Respect the artists at the bar so much, he's never carded
It's... (two for us) ...and none for you
So who can fuck with J on the beats? (Or get as drunk as Lou?)
Let's get it started!

"We keep it tight and that's the way it's supposed to be" - - &gt; Grand Puba

"Ya frontin', boy, come against me" - - &gt; Guru
"Louis Logic" "J.J. Brown"
"Y'all ready?" "No!"

[Louis Logic]
Let's get it started, catch a harlot
in stretched leather garments and wet her carpet
I'm in the sex department at your local video shop
Trying to ingest Bacardi mixed with some pop
with a grip on my crotch
Looking for lust in all ya slut's blue jeans
It's nothin' personal, I'm just too mean
So what new scheme, will I invent next
to blend sex, music and beer?
Into a world of art that you shouldn't hear
I make a profit when I take a topless chick's picture
and disfigure the size of the tits bigger
Cut and paste a couple of sick niggas like me and J-Love on the nipples
Spazzin' out like a couple of cripples
who sip liquor 'till they chuckle a little
Now isn't that cute?
With all this talk about booze and puke
it's no wonder you sick of that dude they call "The Dragon"
When they looking for some action
Drunks ain't falling off anymore
I push 'em off the wagon

[Chorus: Louis Logic] + (J-Love)
Ayo, J!
(What's going on, Lou?)
Let's get it started
Respect the artists at the bar so much, he's never carded
It's... (two for us) ...and none for you
So who can fuck with J on the beats? (Or get as drunk as Lou?)
Let's get it started!

[Louis Logic]
I'm the evil voice that's in your head
when you're drunk as a skunk
That always has you headin' back to the keg
Then you end up splashing your leg with a river of puke
that gets in your boot
and no one at the place will sit next to you
I'm the barer of bad news, a terrible brat who
sneaks out your mom's window in a pair of your dad's shoes
I'll dare her to tattoo
My rap name, square on her ass dude
and deny it like, "I swear, I'm not that Lou"
I'm the reason they invented gauze
cause I'll clench my jaws around your bitches neck, see all men are dogs
But none of 'em like Lou, will run up and bite you
And just to be spiteful, start humpin' your wife too
I'm the rightful ruler and king of the castle
Doing his thing with Long Island Ice Tea, so fuck a Snapple
I'll chug a flask full of whisky and ask you to diss me
After I'm pissy, just to prove how much I love to battle

[Chorus: Louis Logic] + (J-Love)
Ayo, J!
(What's going on, Lou?)
Let's get it started
Respect the artists at the bar so much, he's never carded

Ayo, J!

Let's get it started
Respected artists at the bar so much, he's never carded
It's... (two for us) ...and none for you
So who can fuck with J on the beats? (Or get as drunk as Lou?)
Let's get it started!
