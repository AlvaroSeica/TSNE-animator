[Verse 1: Yaki Kadafi]
We do this thug life shit, like 4, 5, 6, dick em'
Down wit' no rounds left up in the pound when the sounds (Here we go)
Squeeze the lead off, I blow his mutha fuckin' head off
Signal all the other outlawz to get this shit set off
Yaki Kadafi, it ain't a cop here to stop me
These streetz is black hockey and raw we get sloppy
Put a pamper on your silly ass prestyle grammar
Locked in the slammer, while I'm layed cocked back like a hammer
Ya'll newly weds that in honey moons, times bout up
Ya'll, that means I leave no trace found with you face, bounce, stuck
Your pig scanners can't come close touch or even hit me
Doin' my dirt, puttin' in work, you see shit, what you gonna do?
Secretz to war!

[Chorus: Kastro]
Secretz to war bust if we must, plus
Handle our business if them jealous niggaz fuck with us
Secretz to war if we must, plus
Handle our business when them jealous niggaz fuck with us

[Verse 2: Hussein Fatal]
Let go my enemies, my heart beat, pump with the heat
So I bust instead of waiting for you punks to squeeze
See you all on my 3 pound rounds, since you conform
Bit the fact that Outlawz just kick down these doors
Bitch niggas be fouling out, hacking me with the wack rhymes
Grabing ya .9, shooting scared, tryin' to take mine
I'm putting pressure on you niggas when I'm mobb
Deep bringing the heat to you dirty ass squad
You can robb, point blank range, peek game
From the pleasure, taminated criminal Hussein
Bitch nigga I try to project steps with the Tek
Murder next, and robb any nigga any set
Hussein, the type of muthafucka dying with trey pounds
Ghetto type be drown, hollow points from the waist down
Secretz to war!

[Chorus: Kastro]

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Now, as I approach the scene, from smoking green, got my eyes close
Niggas I call 'em my foes, I make 'em die froze
Watch me make 'em bleed, makin' G's, Lord help me with it
Got me fakin' bitches of a meal ticket, help me get it
See me in and pray for options, when the precious love stop
Niggas get to pistol poppin', then watch the body drop
I'm a lethal weapon, watch me hit yo set, flash on
Blast on them bitch made niggas with my mask on
Do it for profit, plus I'm, lookin' for punks to bust on
If you ain't screamin' WestSide, nigga get the fuck on
I'm seeing demons hittin' weed, got me hearing screams
Scared to go to sleep, I bust the scene like a dope feen
Probably be punished for it, although you can't ignore it
I live the life of a thug nigga, and die for it
Niggas past the clip and watch me bring 'em to the floor
I got some shit that they ain't ready for, I got the secrets to war

[Chorus: Kastro]</pre>
