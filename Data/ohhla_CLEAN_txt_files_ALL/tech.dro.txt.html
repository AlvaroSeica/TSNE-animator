Chewbacca's not here I'ma do it for your circumcised
niggaz don't realize my format is a palm spectrum
to damage any rectum
This is the real dinosaur funk which permitted G-Funk
to play anally through the trunk a digital master
was given to Sam Cooke and Jimmy Castor
Kurt Cobain was here but Doc Oc' has novacaine
Theoretically keepin puppies and the pedigree
Small fetus brought Santa Claus to greet us
Rappers know I'm equipped with Clorox
and chemicals that'll burn off your lip
Intestines investments hide money in your stomach
Who can stop Pepto Bismol?
Only a Gremlin eatin in Larry Parker like Gizmo
As Dr. Octagonecologyst girls open legs for beer kegs
French toast and herbs were covered with giant eggs
Livin small, people unequal challenge my thoughts
No station or radio will understand
The perfect enzyme is me with your brain in my other hand
Suck my oil, yo Gudio tell em

MP4, six spacecraft in the mix, kissin Mary J. Blige
on Earth was quite normal, 
as Dr. Octagon, walkin through a polygon
My first impression was to give patients a lesson
Who's the best to put me to the test
I'll battle Ultramagnetic, my own self as well
Two mirrors in the clear, I'm floating deep in the atmosphere
Through Los Angeles heights I'll damage Hollywood lights
Woman know my sex computer condoms humpin on Ampex
My number 2-7-5-49-69 disconnected
My first black robot, 
space connected while you listen to Keith Sweat (meow)
Your brain is caught up in a net
Two million thousand three billion wack records in the solar
The system's out of reach, niggaz try to preach
Why you tryin to act fly walkin up Venice Beach?
Zapp, like Roger, my funk is powerful then Troutman
Seven years ago like California was tooken from Mexico
Who knows this magnum five can't scope this
A&amp;R's will go crazy tryin to find someone to duplicate Dr. Octagon
Yo chief administrator, suck my oil

"We are experiencing technical difficulties
 Please stand by"

[speaking in Spanish left untranslated]

Auto four six seven five four three
Equals, the levels, of nobody in this trauma
World of unconciousness
Blackness and power, coming down through the urinalysis
Leaving hands with callouses
Right power</pre>
