[Shawn Wigs]
I feel like the movement is hard and my language is broken
Choking over these words that's meant to be spoken
You keep hoping that Theodore won't reach the Billboards
Sharpen than them Kill Bill swords, fuck the award
I want the press, paper and tour for six months
Amsterdam murders and free lunch
Bally shoes, Louis belts, I want Argile socks
And I don't need gun permits, I got gun stocks
Peace to the company, son, I get percents at Mossberg
I slice, cuz I could pop that Snoopy off your iceberg
Who do you think are? You ain't Allah un-invincible
You grade school kids, I'm your principal
Hear to take that title, that's been on reserve
And to snatch up them sales that Ghost deserve
Cuz you been spending your money on clown acts and hype
This is Theodore, we run New York, overnight</pre>
