[Intro]
Ugh, yea
From the art
Gavlyn
And it's that clarity
Yup, oh, and it's that clarity

[Verse 1]
Cause it's a rush that I feel in my veins
When I'm able to maintain with this wordplay
Each and every day
Some say It's a phase
But I say it's a way of life
Which is why when I grab the mic
I grab the mic tight
Looking at my shadow from another street light
Getting tired of the bullshit, talk is cheap
Yup I ment it when I said it
Cause cats now a days people are too hard headed
Peeps ask, what is hip hop to me
Rhythm, bass with the kick up or a tree
Coming in this culture as a female
Just speaking with detail
Can't catch up to my phases when I shake this
Which is why I leave with no trace
What would a reaction be, without action
What would Gavlyn be, without a passion
What would a painting be, without a vision
What would a story be, without the description
Just doing me, doing my thing
As I bring just not just your ordinary talent
Cause when I kick I got balance
And what I live is what I give is logic
Take a look at my profile from my sense of style
Haven't felt this way in a while
Label myself, as a G
But when I say G I mean
Genuine, feminine, em cee
Oh yea G.A.V

[Chorus]
Yo, never stopping cause it's my life
This ain't a dream this is reality
With this classical clarity
Not tryin' to get props
Just an understanding
It's what I'm showing
And you can pause, or keep it going
Or keep it going...

[Verse 2]
I put in work in my rhyme book
Write a scenery of thoughts
Or just freestyle when I'm going on a walk
Rap about how I'm seen and my change
Getting used to how things we arrange
But still got my own flurry technique
Still got my own definition of unique
When I speak, blending colors
Still make a masterpiece
Never stroke with my confidence at my feet
You can tell the years fly like a breeze
When you look at the leaves, (?) is the melody
Everyday lips hit and eat or spo (?) a tree
Cause the only love of my life is the M.I.C
And lyrically, artistically
Had my word shell like abstract confetti
So you could see me, hear me, feel me
You can keep an open mind
Cause Gav likes to keep an open mind
That's how we do it for life..
(Until the day that I die)

[Chorus]
Yo, never stopping cause it's my life
This ain't a dream this is reality
With this classical clarity
Not tryin' to get props
Just an understanding
It's what I'm showing
And you can pause, or keep it going
Or keep it goin'
