[Krs]
Now all type things that went on this evening
they all say they fresh but I'm here now
who you believin
who couldn't hear a hit if you hit up
what a pity, you tried to be quick wit the tongue
your style is dibbie-dibbie
you need no lyrical rush in your mumblin
whatchu sayin?
I serve you up like stove top stuffing
Im gonna say this once and I mean this
disattach yaself from my penis
give my genitals room to breathe
you take shots at me wit a weak album I cant believe
you got no skills, chill plus your corny
you think your hardcore cuz you got a 40?
my car is not tint
I dont eat wit a chip
when I read I dont squint
in real life I got the hard shit
you cant out grow me
you don't even know me
I be leavin the jam wit your black ass as a trophy
this is nobodys style but the teacher
so dont compare me to none of these creatures, features
feature and battle rappers
krs one is the head clapper

Chorus
Nice &amp; Smooth dem have a title(TITLE)
Flavor Unit has a title(TITLE)
Nice &amp; Smooth dem have a title(TITLE)
Kid Capri have a title
Buck! Buck! Buck!

Remember the name of the crew is called B.D.P.
Remember the name of the crew is called B.D.P.
