Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[J Rich]
So here we are again when the lights go on
Another ending to a night of Irish Car Bombs
Lots of drinks yet too many to remember
I was gettin hooked up and my friend was the bartender
Just, playing pool and DJng on the jutebox
Tom Bany, Steve Miller, Snoop Dogg, and Pac
People spillin their guts like they're just spit hogs
But that's what happens when you mis pain and alcohol
Let's put some money up and make a little side wager
8 ball best out of 5 with just a little paper
It's always fun to put at least a dollar on it
And if you win make sure your victory is always honest
Yea

[Hook]
You never know when your gonna lose
And you never know when your gonna win
(You never know, you never know)
Take a look around 360 views at tonight when it's about to end
(Tonight when it's about to end)
You ain't gotta go home but you gotta get to gettin on outta here
(Get to gettin on outa here)
So when the waitress comes around make sure that you order up another beer
(Another one, another one)

[Chorus]
When the music stops and the lights go down
And she calls for a final round
Closin Time
When the feelings right in the dead of night
At home in a sleepy town
Closin Time
It's closin time turnin off the sign
Makin toast to the ones above
Closin Time
We drink Moonshine and we walk the line
It's a party in every life
Closin Time

[Dirtball]
How's it goin friend why don't you come on in
The weather's lookin schisty the same for many men
Please pull a chair, closer here, order up a cocktail
Whipe away the day with the Whiskey and [?]
So all hail to the bartenders tending
For taking all the pain away and not defending
The reasons why I be drinkin a cold one
My favorite watering hole is holdin my home
My life my problems are one in the same
When the clock strikes 2 that's the end of the game
Back to reality the root of the cons
Became face to face are always because of the lungs
And when the sign's back on I'd be back in the mix
It's a Bloddy Mary mornin I'm gettin my fix
As the last call approaches
I fire up the roaches
And order all my good friends a one last round

[Chorus]
When the music stops and the lights go down
And she calls for a final round
Closin Time
When the feelings right in the dead of night
At home in a sleepy town
Closin Time
It's closin time turnin off the sign
Makin toast to the ones above
Closin Time
We drink Moonshine and we walk the line
It's a party in every life
Closin Time

[Daddy X]
Shut em down! Shut em, Shut em down!
Bottoms up, Closin Time, One last round
We stumbling, fumbling throwin the net
Jivin for the finish threw some wink at cats
Bottle after bottle, Dive after dive
This kid got loud so I socked him in the eye
Cracked him in the jaw
Left, right, Combo!
Put him on the floor play his ass like a bongo
[?] threw us outside
Kottonmouth Kings Now we baned for life
But that's alright
You know how we role
We got more DUI's than the highway patrol

[Chorus]
When the music stops and the lights go down
And she calls for a final round
Closin Time
When the feelings right in the dead of night
At home in a sleepy town
Closin Time
It's closin time turnin off the sign
Makin toast to the ones above
Closin Time
We drink Moonshine and we walk the line
It's a party in every life
Closin Time

[D-Loc]
Walk in the room the whole place stops and looks at me
Cats from the other side recognize my tats
What's up with that?
I see whispering
Must be that crown on my neck I wreck that 'H' on my back
Right into the bar people lookin I'm a star
Right into the bar time to get some alcohol
Right into the bar while I slip into my zone
I got to get a shot of [?] that Patron
So hey bartender we got to keep em movin
Anybody wants a drink say you better get to missin
Me I'm in a hurry cause I want another shot
Plus I wanna get blitzed get ahead to smoke some pot
This life I chose late nights and long roads
Half hours in the dark my joint stay spark
I'm baggin bunddles
Health is key
Cause I chase these dreams in this concrete jungle

[Chorus]
When the music stops and the lights go down
And she calls for a final round
Closin Time
When the feelings right in the dead of night
At home in a sleepy town
Closin Time
It's closin time turnin off the sign
Makin toast to the ones above
Closin Time
We drink Moonshine and we walk the line
It's a party in every life
Closin Time</pre>
