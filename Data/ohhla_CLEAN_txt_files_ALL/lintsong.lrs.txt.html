Hey kids, let's talk about lint!

Lint in your pockets in your navel too
Lint on your clothes and in your shoes
Lint on the carpet, in the washing machine
Lint in your undies, red, blue, or green
Lint, lint what are you?
Lint, lint what do we do -
With lint everywhere,
on the floor, on the chair
Because lint is dangerous if you don't stop it in time
So listen to this funky lint rock rhyme (uh huh)

[CHORUS]
This is the link song, everybody sing along
Until the break of dawn: lint, lint, lint, lint!
This is the link song, everybody sing along
Until the break of dawn: lint, lint, lint, lint!

Lint is everywhere you look
On your bed in a library book
Lint can even be found at sea
In a boat floating swiftly
But you didn't think of that
but you've got lint underneath your hat
And you've got lint in your navel too
So get a clue, that lint's got you
Hey you've got lint growing out
Of your ears, what's that about?
You're an old man, man, linty man
Linty linty linty man

[CHORUS]

Gloria Johnson, age 47, had a lint infection in her belly.
She went to the doctor complaining of a stomachache.
The lint actually entered her intestines and infected them through her belly button.
Hey, that's not funny!

[CHORUS]

When it comes to being clean take the lint right out your belly
But don't wipe it on your friends because lint is very smelly
Don't put it in a sandwich with peanut butter and jelly
They don't say "TV" in England, they talk funny they say "telly" (what?)

Lint, lint, lint, lint!
Lint, lint, lint, lint!
