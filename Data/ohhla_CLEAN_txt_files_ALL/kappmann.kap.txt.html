[Intro: sampled]
To the Batmobile, let's go~!
Atomic batteries to power, turbines to speed
(Roger, ready to move out)
{*signature spinning Bat logo sound*}

[Madd Kapp]
Three o'clock in the mornin I'll be scrapin the curb
I'm down pimper to the D to the burbest of burbs
Sippin 'gnac, let me elaborate, I'm leaned back
Wearin R. Kelly's mask and Bishop Don's hat
Mad pimpin, but never Superman to these bitches
I'm outstanding, destined for the fame and riches
That's how I planned it, learned the game from top to bottom
Daytime entrepeneur, night time Ramada
That's dirty! (To the beat y'all) Heh, but that's the way that I'm livin
I don't hang with too many dudes, I wanna stay out of prison
I call myself Kapp Mann cause I mash through Gotham
And I'm a wild motherfucker, I'm the one that you watchin

[Chorus]
Just call me Kapp Mann! Kapp Mann!
KAPP MANN! Kapp Mann
KAPP MANN, KAPP MANN, KAPP MANN!!

[Madd Kapp]
I done shook up thangs and made the rap scene noticed
And I done came up focused over the hopeless locus
I drop my vocals and split, I got some paper to get
I bootleg my own shit if I run out of my shit
That's called saavy, and they ain't teachin that up in college
And if you hungry, you bound to stumble onto this knowledge
Now let me explain, in broken english, english the same
Never trust a motherfucker or you're losin this game
And I done it, done it, done it, done it
(To the beat y'all)
But now I'm on the, top of my game
So fuck losin, I'm Madd Kapp, baby I reign
I'm a flamethrower, burnin down the club to the ground
A superhero honkey headed for the throne in the clouds

[Chorus]

[Madd Kapp]
It ain't easy bein breezy assholes be hatin
They never minded when I was broke, recordin in basements
Now they think that I'm arrogant, but it ain't that at all
I'm just bullshit free, I put my word on my balls
So fuck 'em all with this middle finger I host in the air
Let 'em talk all that weak shit, I'm everywhere
So let 'em stop and just stare, lookin hard at a legend
I'm Madd Kapp, nephew, freestyle and forget it
I'm like Uncle Elroy, I'm the KAING around here~!
I'm ain't talkin to your ass unless you buy me a beer
I'm what's hot down river, that's the way this shit is
You got some skills on the mic, drop your demo by my crib
So we can split up a million, the studio's where I live

[Chorus] - change first three words to "They call me"</pre>
