[Intro: The Reverend William Burk]
Ay yo, check it
Take ya on a trip
Back in the days
Slave narrative
Listen

[The Reverend William Burk]
My mother taught me my history, she remembered it vividly
From the trip on the ship to the cotton fields of misery
Forced to live her life as a slave, but only physically
Despite all of the chains they couldn't capture her mentally
She lit a flame in my soul, told me my mind's worth more than gold
Keep it strong until you're old, and at the crossroad, son
At the first chance you better run, don't never look back
And never wait around here, for noone
They captured my momma in Ghana, took her to Bahamas
Where they (?) her, then brought her here to Carolina
Where she had me, hopin' that I one day be free
But she never got to see 'cause she died at 43
They said she poisened Master's food, so they hung her from a tree
I died on the inside, I cried till my eyes dried
I couldn't eat, I couldn't sleep, I felt they killed my pride
Don't worry, mother dear, in my heart's where you reside
Never forgot your words, I just couldn't run and abandon you
Livin' this life of a slave is worse than being animals
I can't stay here in this horrible atmosphere
These are my last days here, now my mind is clear

[Chorus x2: The Reverend William Burk]
Come on, let's run free, we can take it
If we stick together, we can make it
This bondage, we gotta break it
The chains on the mind stop us from being Divine
I can't live without freedom, I gotta get mine

[The Reverend William Burk]
I feel the sweat drippin' from my face down to my waist
I gotta pick up the pace, it's like a race, and I'm in last place
Runnin' through the woods in the dark, I hear my heart beatin'
Feel the heat of the rugged earth under my feet
I gotta compete, can't stop, rest or sleep
Or else I'll meet defeat, but I must admit I'm beat
I inhale the smell of the woods and exhale the pain
My brain is focused on freedom as it begins to rain
It's hard to run under the gun, but I continue
Cause I know if I stop now, plain and simple I'm through
Brought to this land by the white man
I don't understand his corrupted evil plan, he must be damned
I stop for a minute just to catch my breath
Suddenly turn around and witness the face of death
I hear the sound of horses and dog steps behind me
I duck behind a tree, hopin' that they wouldn't find me
But next thing I know I hear a gun blast and then total silence
Except for my heart beatin' fast
I close my eyes and see my mom as if she was alive
She grabbed me by the hand and helped me rise
As I ascended to the skies, goodbye to this land
It's away, I release the rage
Feelin' like the world is a book and my life is a page
I followed the bright light at the back of the cage
And although I have been killed I was no longer a slave
