kush land
yea buddy

taylor gang
taylor made
taylor made
money gang
yeaa, bitch
(laughter)

the world turns (world turns)
the kush burns (burns)
I touch paper
more paper than a bookworm (a bookworm)
so look learn
all I need's my cake
a blunt and a pretty face
then I'm straight like a good perm (good perm)
and her swag so official (uhhh)
taylor made money gang
I'm the general (I'm the general)
and all my weed strong
like kimbo slice (slice)
money's the only thing I do twice (twice)
I'm in the fast lane
yellow chain, blue lights (yeaa)
and you gon' need shades (shades)
they say I'm to bright (bright)
or shitten on the game (shitten on game)
so bring through wipes (wipes)
and you can clean up (up)
and try to beat us (yeaa)
I'm sure you niggas is ballin
that's what they all say (say)
but me plus gettin money
gon' equal all day (all day)
my seats [?]
bitch from the caribbean
she say por que (wizzle k h a f...)

super fresh and my swag so official
super fresh and my swag so official

and my swag so official
swag swag, so official
and my swag so official
swag swag, so official, [x2]

(puerrrr I'm gone)
the swag just left the room (room)
and I ain't impressed
got you feelin underdressed (yeaa)
any time you find him in the building
I'm a threat
got some gucci chuck tay's (tay's)
you ain't seen yet (ya ain't seen yet)
yellow ice, so I may seem fresh (yeeea)
but if you did what I'm doin
nigga, you'd be feelin spoiled rotten (rotten)
in my city I got pull (i got pull)
so don't tug
or get drugged
through the mud probably
like my weed rolled (rolled)
i stay done properly
i put my team on (on)
and now we own property (yeeeeaaaa)
and my swag so official
no magazines, so my cash not a issue (nahhhhh)
tell the ref to throw the flag
blow the whistle
cause your style's out of date
that's a foul on the plate
and your words don't hurt
cause I'm flyin out the way
what you make a month
I probably spent today (day, puerrrr)

super fresh and my swag so official
super fresh and my swag so official
and my swag so official
swag swag, so official
and my swag so official
Swag Swag, So Official [x2]</pre>
