[Chorus 4X - imitating Big Daddy Kane on "The Symphony"]
You, got to groove...
Freeze, stand still, MOVE

[Gift of Gab]
Huffin and puffin, this track is bumpin discussion
on how we crushin and snuffin
The one's that bluffin, it's nothin
and while they lunchin, we bustin
to get you, up in the club and
We keep you wantin and dubbin
Dig it like somethin you puffin on
Fill it up in your stomach to your astonishment, on a mission
The marvelous, starvenous, verbal novelist, killin 'em softly
Offin them, often they in a coffin, we drillin' them, taunt 'em
All in the tournament, in the bottomless pit again
Pardon me, but this art is like the parliament rockets parkin
All on yo' gardens and +lawns+ just like +potholes+, sonically stompin
Up on a mission of dominance, solid flawless, so obvious
Callin y'all to the ball to get off the wall, everybody yes, YOU [*echoes*]

[Chorus]

[Gift of Gab]
I've been to Africa, Brazil, everywhere across the Americas
Canada, France, Italy, Copenhagen, Australia
Everywhere, every time, every audience, mass hysteria
Some rappers make good records, but live they are a failure
Mailin your area, special delivery carrier
Tearin the various barriers, 'til everyone's everyone
Whether you're heavy or Libra, or Aries, or Lebanese
Vegetarian, Ebony, Ivory, seventeen or ninety-THREE
I don't care if you're arrogant, or inherit inheritance
From yo' parent's parent and then didn't share it with N'ER NIGGA
Prepare if you dare, to get yo' HANDS IN THE AIR
It's a rare form, Mary'll shake her derriere witcha
BEAR witness to SNARE kicks that TEAR and rip through
the blarin' speaker woofers that pummel into the AIR [and] hit cha
It's there witcha, yo' cares lifted, don't stare driftin
The airs shiftin slightly, so come into the lair, get SUM

[Lifesavas]
"Party people, you are now being rocked by the sounds
of Chief Xcel and Gift of Gab, Blackalicious
We're here to take you higher, y'all!
And I want everybody from side, to side in the front
and the back Everybody in the building
MAKE SOME NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOISE" (*crowd cheers*)

[Gift of Gab- through speakerphone then normal]
Jumpin and movin
and dancin and sweatin
and shoutin and grindin
And bobbin and weavin
we takin you outta yo' mind
and the science applyin this, high in the sky in this pio-lots
Flyin this, dia-late ir-is, wireless mics
The fire is bright, retire, I'm sire, you're squire
and dire straits, admirin higher intelligence, dialect science (*exhales*)
I elect my-self Vice Prez, I'll belt
Rappers that lie to get by and get fried
and left by their self scientists
Thrive when this guy is lit, try and spit fire
with my intent I in-vent sciences, try the best with no side effects
Buy a vest or be lyin in rest, tryin to test
The eyes in the eyes of the vi-brant lion with iron tiger fists

[Chorus and guitar riff]</pre>
