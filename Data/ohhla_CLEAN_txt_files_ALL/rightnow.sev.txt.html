[Verse]
my man was deep in love it was almost sickening
couldn't leave the house unless his girlfriend was with him
bought her the flyest gear took trips around the world
his phone was always busy yappin' to his girl
I wasn't hatin' on my man I was like do ya thing son
never know - she might be the one
come to think about it y'all look good together
I'm happy for you duke hope it lasts forever
I didn't wanna get between such a good thing
they my man got inspired and pulled out a ring
got down on one knee and started to propose
but before he could finish this chic was like "no"
said she wasn't ready - and bolted out the door
my man was in shock and totally floored
just let her go bruh - she'll be back for sure
if it was meant to be then she's worth waiting for
she's 16 years young and very depressed
a beautiful girl but she's trying to impress
this fool at school but he could care less
now losing weight to fit a certain size dress
she lives inside magazines she gets
wants blue eyes and much bigger breasts
believes all the lies - readin'em right to left
twisting it backwards so there's no self respect
and she's crying actually thinking about dying
taking her own life cause the mirror ain't supplying
that visual - that she wants to see
so now she contemplates getting plastic surgery
it's all real - all this for one lowly guy
he's only here for the curves he ain't down for the ride
I'm trying to say you've already been blessed
so close the magazine you're too young for this stress
ya just got home today got off the plane
got plans to make got dates to take
no rain in the sky but you see some clouds
now it's lookin' like smoke this ain't no joke
downtown is your direction with heads lookin' up
staring at they faces and they all shookin' up
so you ask the cab to please stop right here
mixed with curiosity and fear
and just before steppin' out you see this low flying plane
this cat's insane he not right in the brain
feelin' that something was odd and things about to change
ya intuition was late there was already flames
bellowing out the massive hole in the first tower
outta control with smoke and debris giving showers
to cover the skyline and street landscapes
no escape for ground zero and ill determined fate
the 2nd plane hit you knew it was time to go
like mos, nate and pharaoh ya whole vibe was like "oh no"
and you fell down and cried
then something inside made you lose ya mind

[Chorus]
well all need change - now
before it's too late - right now
aint no delay - now
what's the time - right here right now</pre>
