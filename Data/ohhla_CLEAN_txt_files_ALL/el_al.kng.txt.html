[Verse 1: King Lil G]
I got my girl pregnant at 19
And I thought I'd never make it
All the drama I was facing
All my friends was gang related
All I gave fuck about was slangin'
Never thought of making changes
Till we got the crib raided (raided)
Drug dealin' cases
My homeboy buzzard incarcerated
Suddenly my whole life change
Now I'm livin' life real slow
My lil son is what I live for
My whole clicks what I'd kill for
Redel castro in sinaloa
Now we making that real doe
This the shit
That I'm built for
This the shit
He got killed for
I swear to god
Me &amp; my baby mama
Was meant to be
Till she went through my phone that night
Caught me cheating with Stephanie
Naked pictures she txted me
Goddamn you stressing me
I'm like goddamn you stressing me

[Chorus]
I'm surrounded by soldiers
All the gangstas salute me
All the gangstas they love us
And they wanna recruit me
I swear to god my life's a gangsta movie
My life is like a gangsta movie
Fumando mota &amp; sellin' coca
Like gangsta movies
Like Al Pacino
Doing perico in mafia movies

[Verse 2: King Lil G]
Shits about to get real
I'm tellin you the shits real
Wasn't old enough to buy cigarettes
But I was old enough to drug deal
We was old enough to kill
We was old enough to pay bills
I was living poor
Slept on the floor
Tell me how the fuck would you feel?
In that one bedroom apartment
I was far from stardom
Guns in glove-compartments
Staying far from the law
Enforcement they was on us tough
Gang unit rushing us
I wrote songs in my worse time
When I felt hopeless &amp; suicidal
Close friends kept hating on me
Shout out to my future rivals
Shout out to my newest rivals
Who talk shit but I can't find em
Mad ass fuck cause they stayed behind
But I don't see em
I'm still grindin'

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: LA Gun Smoke]
Life ain't what it might seem
Hit the pen at 19
Now I'm out &amp; I'll shoot it out
Gangsta shit
What you about?
My hand guns I can't do without
Fuck with me &amp; I'll pull it out
Shots are bangin'
Shots are rangin'
Investigation, snitches singin'
Telling cops where the kilos stayin'
Telling the cops our information
Talking to pops at visitation
On parole still debatin'
Pick up work still debatin'
Still debatin', still debatin'
Life ain't what it might mean
I got 2 strikes
And I might fight three
If they catch me with the burner
Cause I got a couple fucken murders
Coming from the state of California
1, 2, 3 strikes
And they will hold ya
You weren't trying to do life
I thought I told ya
All that shit from being a soulja

You feel that?

[Chorus]</pre>
