L.A. to down under
What up Muph, let's give it to em

[Muph]
It's 2004
It's time to make your choice

[Muph]
So I'm the king of this kingdom like a pimp in prison
Handing out women, for a minimum fee, for free!
Keep living with an ambition that exceeds binge drinking
I'm no victim, I believe in this team swinging
Hitting the dreams I've seen the seems ripping
The obscene mission sides, live and fiend for the steam drifting
From the bitumen, creamed by the stream of riddle and booze I choose to mix it in
This was a life I was living in
It's alright for most but I was a host to giving in
The simple things affect the citizens within my fortress
I was willing to let the sins burn the skin of the ones that fought this
Raucous, thoughtless, pauper who ignored the corner
That was closing in, so now I'm focusing
On noticing the details between servants, serpents, jesters and sea-snails
The queens, the females, I inhale their beauty
An exhale a head spin, my duty is to use thee
Power I've got, to look after the ones I love full stop
As a king of my world I feel this is my job
As a king of my world, this is my job

{*Scratches*}
"You can't wear my crown you clown"
"This is my time to live"
"You can't wear my crown you clown"
"Thank god I'm alive"

[The Grouch]
Well my job isn't a job, it's all that I wish
And it's wived and I'm involved so I'll solve this
No prob, use my noggin and she's all mine
Like a thought with my dick but fed her just a line
Is it better just to rhyme or do I rhyme better thinking?
Hard to let it sink in, I'm smarter with my ink pen
And larger, chart you face value and now you
Understand the game plan and how to say your name brand style too
Cause everybody's got a dream inside
Red light, green light, when you gonna scream and drive
I'm driven, I drove the whole ride
Matter of fact I'm giving less since I sold the old Sky
Bought a bright new blue one for the night who's viewing
For the sights we're seeing are freeing all the locks up
Bullies and the jocks just die after high school
To stay alive you've gotta ride with the right crews
People get screwed and hammer out the kinks
Don't wanna make the news but I'll slam another drink
Drunk punks pump to save the world
We want money, freedom and girls
I said young god's out, to change the earth
Give me respect, fact, freedom and dirt

{*Scratches*}
"You can't wear my crown you clown"
"This is my time to live"
"You can't wear my crown you clown"

Feeling anxious, young rappers want to get signed
My advice is do it yourself and take your time
Stabilise your mind, never plagiarise your rhymes
If you're capable of lines, that captivate the human kind
You'll make it, independent kingdom creation
Keep your enemies close and hold the henchmen sacred
They'll try and leap over walls and crawl into your basement
A real king or queen is eager and keen but patient
Your rule of nation is your own life you're facing
Panels and boards short circuit in the control station
Your soul stays pacing until the unbreakable is breaking
While their chasing, I'm pacing and making decisions
On how to improve this kingdom, blueprint plans and missions
I overstand the division, make use of the truth and the equipment
I remember Draino dishing out CD's, pure heads had reached the eastern streets
Way before I even hooked up through Obese, the shoes meet the pavement
I catapult my tracks in the form of a laid back attack
As the arrangement stays within my civilisation
And I begin to roam towards my throne and move towards bigger things</pre>
