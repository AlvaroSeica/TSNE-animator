[Intro-Chorus]
Bone, Bone, Bone Thugs (Ooooh, how we do it)
Bone, Bone, Bone Thugs (It's all about the music)
Bone, Bone, Bone Thugs (It's all about the music)
Everyday, day, it seems it's gettin' shorter as the world turns
Round and round, these last day, day so crazy, oh why

Everyday, day, it seems it's gettin' shorter as the world turns
Round and round, these last day, day so crazy, oh why

Everyday, day, it seems it's gettin' shorter as the world turns
Round and round, these last day, day so crazy, oh why

[Krayzie]
They tellin' me criminals be crazy and would it be reason for the
Brutality, they killin' these niggaz in cold blood, Bone Thug
Been a part of the reality all the insanity they know who humanity
Whatever happened to family us man we back in the game back when
The crack came it ain't to much (??) the day seems like it's never
Gon' get better (better) forever get the love and peace (peace)
"Day's of our Lives" they keep on gettin' shorter everytime that I
Realize, telly warn me to long --before-- we wake up and the world
Is gone, and it won't mean no, world war it'll be Armagedon for sure
For sure...

[Chorus]
Everyday, day, it seems it's gettin' shorter as the world turns
Round and round, these last day, day so crazy, oh why

Everyday, day, it seems it's gettin' shorter as the world turns
Round and round, these last day, day so crazy, oh why

[Wish]
Everywhere we look there's so much violence, violence and I won't
Makin' no bet I'll quit the riots, riot and you ain't gotta lose
It's all about the roads that you choose but what is there to do
When your brought up and stung like ooh and I can see your pain
Young thugs stay focused cause we can get this money young thugs
Even though the end of days are comin' (comin') we can get it right
Right now do somethin' for somebody just hold on for me I promise
There's a better place for all us t-h-u-g's if he don't believe
Then, don't call yourself a thugs cause thugs believe who don't
Believe, who don't believe

[Chorus]
Everyday, day, it seems it's gettin' shorter as the world turns
Round and round, these last day, day so crazy, oh why

Everyday, day, it seems it's gettin' shorter as the world turns
Round and round, these last day, day so crazy, oh why

[Layzie]
Sometimes I sit back and I think why me, now how did I become a
Victim of the struggle everyday tryin' to piece this puzzle and every
Second I'm out on the hustle I sit and I guzzle hopin' reality'll
Pass me by, right on by and I'm not gonna sit and lie how a my life
Has been at fine I could test some reals alot of determination and
Skills and the death ain't never come easy not when a nick gotta
Pay these bills I scrape this meal feed this man of the house
Gotta keep that money comin' gotta be out here doin' somethin'
Rather than sittin' back broke with nothin' can you feel me if I
Have to come and get ya, I'm a get ya you gon' feel me and what did
They say about little Lay he's a ghetto legend niggaz is out here
Threatened cause I'm headed for Armagedon baby

[Chorus]
Everyday, day, it seems it's gettin' shorter as the world turns
Round and round, these last day, day so crazy, oh why

Everyday, day, it seems it's gettin' shorter as the world turns
Round and round, these last day, day so crazy, oh why

[Bizzy]
Back in the day with little Lay and all the Bones we got to
Scrappin' for pay sometimes I miss when we were kids is all
Now since ninety-five back when Eazy died of a A-I-D's oh what a
Disease 'n how many harmony out could it be now everybody wanna
Keep us twisted you better believe it, little Eazy whispers
Different gotta keep my distance me payed up on the buildin' none
Of us used that just don't stop until I get shot, shot wheelin'
And dealin' me back in the day from the crack lock yeah I see
Greg roll it I seen bad murder, murders St. Claire as for the
Industry we're pickin' now, sickin' now and the hard headed came
To break it down lick it out

[Chorus]
Everyday, day, it seems it's gettin' shorter as the world turns
Round and round, these last day, day so crazy, oh why

Everyday, day, it seems it's gettin' shorter as the world turns
Round and round, these last day, day so crazy, oh why</pre>
