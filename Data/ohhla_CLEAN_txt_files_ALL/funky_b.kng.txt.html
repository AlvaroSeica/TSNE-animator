[ Sugar Kay ]
Step into the dangerzone and get blown
The microphone junkie's on the microphone
I ain't a joke, nothin like Bob Hope
I make real rap songs, hard and cock-strong
You'll never catch us making a rock song
The Kings Of Swing is not nothin to sleep on
I'm Sugar Kay, the poet, the mike supreme
Grippin the mic with the gangster lean
I'm like Moses, I can part the Red Sea
You wanna step up, huh, and try to mess with thee?
Please, I make you bow down to your knees
Sugar Kay is murderin MC's
I'm Asiatic, rhymes get dramatic
If I see a fly cutie, huh, I gotta tap it
My style's unique and all the girls I keep in heat
I'm Sugar Kay, I got a funky technique
I bag and bruise all the hoes I like to choose
Are steppin to it cause I got the tools
Spread the news, I got a new sound
So Milk Dee, let me get a funky breakdown

(Break)	--&gt; T La Rock
(Down)	--&gt; L.L. Cool J

[ Mike Master ]
Grab a hold of yourself and let the dopeness flow
Within your bloodstream runnin like H2O
Yo, the man, the myth, never puffin a spliff
Just gettin blunted on the mic and keepin suckers scared stiff
I'm the Mike Master, also the mike deacon
Servin somethin funky everytime you hear me speakin
Givin you more than what you bargained for
I'm like Jordan on the mike and I'm bound to score
So flow into a midst of clouds and I guide you
Let our spirits enhance as I get inside you
Beat your soul, then gain control
Of your mind and your body with a drumroll
Broken down in my rhyme, put together combined
Into the musical aspect of a artist design
The almighty on the strength we're goin the length
Check out my lyrical ecstacy, it's self-evident
I'll take a dead crowd and make em all come alive
Let the funk flow cause I'm dopedafied
And qualified to break and rip your whole town
So Milk Dee, let me get a funky breakdown

[ Sugar Kay ]
Check out the beat, the bass, the tone, the sound
When we start rockin suckers catch a nervous breakdown
Here's the breakdown, rhymes I lay down
So if you wanna step up, huh, you better stay down
I'm so precise and nice, you think twice
I treat you like a hustle when I'm shootin the dice
My advice you get ice, so bust a move
You catch a beatdown if you're steppin to this gangster groove
I'm Sugar Kay, the best you could get
So Mike Master (yo) get ready, get set

[ Mike Master ]
I'm so smooth and raw, you want more
Stickin a mike until the cord gets sore
Therefore prepare to wear and tear
The whole dancefloor cause the Kings is in here
Makin it rough, makin it tough
Cause I got the stuff, you can't get enough
Of the way that it's done like, serious as a gunfight
So put your guards up because I'm rockin tonight
Cocoa Channelle controls the funkyness, the flow of the sound
So Milk Dee, let me get a funky breakdown</pre>
