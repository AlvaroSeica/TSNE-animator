[Verse 1 - Akrobatik]
Hey yo, you ever copped a joint that seemed to be on point?
But when you see the artist live, they strictly disappoint ('point)
Rhymin off beat, starin at they feet (starin at they feet)
When you seen them in the video, they wasn't this weak (they wasn't this weak)
Yo, it's funny how the most hardcore and most blunted
Knees buckle (knees buckle) when they see a crowd of five hundred (five hundred)
Straight cuffin the mic and you can't hear what they sayin
And three quarters of they set somebody else's beats is playin
(somebody else's beats is playin)
Proud (proud), 'til they see they can't get you loud (loud)
The next move's predictable, blame it on the crowd
(blame it on the crowd, crowd, crowd, crowd)

[Break]
Rapper: I got the illest lyrics (boo)

Rapper: Y'all is straight whack
Akrobatik: We're not feelin you
Rapper: What fuckin city is this?
Akrobatik: You're not even from the ghetto, lame ass flow, what is that?
Akrobatik: You got no lyrics
Rapper: Yo, yo, y'all is weak, y'all don't know no hip-hop

[Verse 2 - Akrobatik]
Yo money, how the people goin to think that you tight?
When you kick the same quote unquote freestyle every night (check this out yo)
Yo, a star it don't make you
When every single member of the audience feels like they could take you
(feels like they could take you)
Cats be comin through with egos enormous
But can't seem to give a halfway decent performance

[Chorus - Akrobatik] - w/ ad libs
Newsflash, rappers talk shit
Who they are, what they got and what chicks they hit
With the mad arrogance and the words they spit
But when it's time to hit the stage they just ain't legit
Newsflash

[Break]
Rapper: When I say diamonds, y'all say ice
Rapper: Diamonds
Akrobatik: Yeah, right, yeah, right
Rapper: Yo, yo, yo, y'all motherfuckers better throw your hands up in the sky or somethin before I - yo
Akrobatik: Whatever man, take that, (hmm), take that

[Verse 3 - Akrobatik]
And what about the headliners?
You know them cats that's supposed to be the show's main shiner
(you know them cats that's supposed to be the show's main shiner)
Steady gettin taxed (taxed) by the openin act (openin act)
Consumin brew and cold cuts in the back, blind to the fact
(cold cuts in the back, blind to the fact)
They get you so pissed you just might start booin (what?)
'Cause the artists are so fucked up, they don't know what joints they doin
(joints they doin)
Screamin in the mic like "yo, who got the roofies? (who got the roofies)
We got video cameras for the butt naked groupies" (butt naked groupies)

[Break] - w/ ad libs
Rapper #1: Yo, yo, y'all, all y'all niggaz

Rapper #2: All my niggaz of this side drinkin

Rapper #1: After the show, know what I'm sayin?
Rapper #2: Alright, word
Rapper #1: In the tour bus or at the tellie
Rapper #1: Know what I'm sayin?? Yo

[Verse 4 - Akrobatik]
Yo, durin all of this, now you ready to scram 
'Cause your favorite act done fucked up your favorite jam (favorite jam)
The whole show seemed like a twenty dollar scam (twenty dollar scam)
And you embarrassed because you invited all your local fam (all your local fam)
But you know it don't go down like this at every single show (true)
So you at the next event chillin in the front row (front row)
And as it go yo, tonight wasn't totally whack
Thank God Akrobatik was the openin act (thank God Akrobatik was the openin act)

[Chorus - Akrobatik] - w/ ad libs
