[Ice-T]
This fucking city, run by pigs
They take the rights away from, all the kids
Understand it
We're fighting a war, we can't win
They hate us, we hate them
We can't win - NO WAY!!

[Ice-T]
Walk down the street, I flip them off
They hit me across the head with a.. Billy Club (Stick)
Understand it
We're fighting a war, we can't win
They hate us, we hate them
We can't win - NO WAY!!

[Ice-T]
NOTHING I do, NOTHING I say
I tell them to go get FUCKED!!
They put me AWAY! - understand it
We fight a war, we can't win
They hate us, we hate them
We can't win - NO WAY!!

[Ice-T]
I go to court, pay for my crime
Stand in line to pay bail
I may serve time - understand it
We're fighting a war, we can't win
They hate us, we hate them
We can't win - NO WAY!!

[Outro: Ice-T]
POLICE STORY!! </pre>
