[Verse 1]
Slanging girlie in the morning early got the cash to rush
MOB and that's a must, COD I got no trust
And I be b mf'n a million won't last a month
All I need is one PNC and that's enough and
And I ain't even cranked up yet but bet I'm gassin up
When my prada pressed that pedal bitch you better fasten up
I exhale ash the blunt inhale a hundred tons
Not even a hundred one, couldn't bring back how it was
When M brick was 17 and you ain't had to rob your plug
Man rapping was an art now this shit a joke
Catch a couple dollar few jewels and some pussy
I'm getting a little too power drunk now I'm on that bullshit

[Chorus: x2]
I got a problem and a plan
Revolver in my hand
Tryin' to keep it cold
Bitch y'all won't understand
That's why I roll
That's why I roll with the bible on the dash
That's why I roll
That's why I roll with the bible on the dash

[Verse 2]
Cuttin corners on coronas
Tryin' to buck up on a bonus
Out here on my lonely last stoggie
But I'm focused now I know
Friends parallel to foe
And all that good pussy leave you parallel and broke
I aksed the pastor what's the fastest way to heaven
For a bastard with a tonish past
Give me a honest answer
With all this Hannah Montana without the arm and hammer
Am I gonna get the slammer or the casket
Tryin' to keep a level head rolling on this rocky road
It's a full time gig trying to keep this glock poled
I got the work, water and the pot need a hot stove
Vendor down as bitch in a squad down the road

[Chorus: x2]
I got a problem and a plan
Revolver in my hand
Tryin' to keep it cold
Bitch y'all won't understand
That's why I roll
That's why I roll with the bible on the dash
That's why I roll
That's why I roll with the bible on the dash</pre>
