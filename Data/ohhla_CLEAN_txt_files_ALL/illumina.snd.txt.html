Every man is not created equal
We're all created mad different, some are bad people
The bald eagle's mad evil
Place you into class C, feed you placebo
Chick the cops were caught spooning caught it sooner than the pack
Think they're tapping your computer? Your computer is a tap
Human traffickers wanna track you, your computer is map
Forget whoever fingerprints that got a match, they got a Mac
Every app that's on your jack's for getting jacked
Every act on every bill and every law and every bill and every act
Is game that's run so they could run up where you at
They got padding down down pat, I gotta give 'em that
Now it's money that I never had, I'm supposed to give it back
They keep statistics on the gifted, young, and black
They put out statistics, people read 'em, act like they be given fact
Think they been given lean when they been given fat

Chemtrails, the MO arrest, then raise the rent in jails
GMO, the monkey wrench in your entrails
All you see is shop and save sales
Where's the dough you spent to try and save whales?
Well
That was took and added to the moneys from the breast cancer walk
Who knows what's the answer to what it bought?
The grief with which you have been wrought was all for naught
It's too high a cost trying to save the orphans, just keep em off the lawn
The war on drugs been going on for awful long
So folks married to the game instead of dating off and on
But there's no poppy fields in Harlem, look around
But for some reason all the brown ni√±os turn to Nino Browns
We used to beat on Bush but now he's not around
So people have found a different bush to beat around
Favorite noise of boys in blue "Kapow"
You're bound to catch a round
You're almost lucky when they only beat you down

Tight girls straighten out their tight curls
Everybody wants to be a skinny white girl
'cause all you see is skinny white girls
Though black girls are allowed if they're getting loud or if they're getting plowed
Keep 'em from being proud, it's easier to keep 'em down
Keep 'em drowning in doubt, keep 'em down and out
Favor Flavor, chuck the Chuck D
You could say that black is ugly long as you say it round about
It's not the type of ish with which to clown around
Rap to them about capping, pow, instead of cap and gowns
Tell 'em that they're bugging out if they don't get around
It'll bug em out too much to wrap their head around
Release the hounds
How?
Create an enemy to hate
By then it won't be tough
By then they'll hate themselves so much they couldn't wait
They'll drown in booze that which they couldn't take
And debt'll make em slaves
And then we cut the pay and lengthen days
Provide the drugs to medicate, then cut the Medicaid
And institute a military state
Provide Israel with military aid just to rub it in they face
They'll be afraid because they don't have any faith
They'll claim that they believe but that it is not how they behave
As money comes to power over power that's divine
They will all turn into cowards because they're all afraid to die
They'll never form alliance
They'll be content to live a lie as long as they're alive
The sirs and madams will surmise
That it's on us which they rely, they'll never realize
That we rely on them
Any moment they decide, they could make it end
Instead just make some ends 'cause life is hopeless, times are hard
And keep 'em focused on religion so they never look for God</pre>
