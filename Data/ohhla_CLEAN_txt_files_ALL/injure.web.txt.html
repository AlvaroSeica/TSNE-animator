Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Yeah
This is for all you shit talking mother fuckers out there
When are you living shit?
'Cause if you push somebody to that limit
Push that wrong button
You feelin' me?
Dude's bound to just turn around and..
Psh, fucking injure you
Know what I mean?

You'll get injured
Grab around your neck
With my hands
And choke out every fucking last breath if I can
God damn
I'm usually mad stoned and friendly
But like anybody
There are many sides to Webby

I don't need a pistol
I'm leaving you knocked out
Show up at your mom's house
Like bitch, whatchu want now?
My sanity can't be found
Try to step hither
I'll stab you in the liver
With a pair of blunt scissors

Run off with a switch blade
Flipped out, displayin'
And slit my own throat first
To show you I ain't playin'
WIth a few beers in me
I'm a rowdy mother fucker
So keep talking
I love it when you doubt me
Mother fucker

'Cause when I feel aggression
I just grab the closest weapon
And beat 'em in the skull with it
Until I make his head spin
Couldn't matter less
My skin color or complexion
I'm a nut case for fucks sake
So quit steppin'

You'll get injured
And that's just be being truthful
I'm brutal
Beat you to death with a pool noodle
Your fucking toy poodle
Can't step to the bite
Leaving him drinking every meal
For the rest of his life
Bitch

You'll get injured
And I ain't playing around
One punch make that ass lay on the ground
If you didn't know before
Then I'm sayin' it now
Yes, I'm sayin' it now
That you're gonna get injured
And I ain't fucking with you
You can't touch me
Or anyone in my crew
You could just ask anybody
It's true
If I'm comin' for you
Then you're gonna get injured

Feelin' like I'm wanting to kill
Straight raging
My boys are like
Knowledge is chill
But on the real
My pockets are filled
With pot and some pills
Ready to leave a mother fucker
With some hospital bills

I'm not stopping until
I see you dropping
And spill
If the bleeding don't kill you
Lack of oxygen will
I'm a doctor
Not like Phil
But more like Kevorkian
Get over here
I'm bout to finish up my scorpion

Stick my fingers in between your rib cage
Force 'em in
It's straight open
You'll walk like an accordion
I ain't trying to pretend that I'm the hardest
But honest
I'm a beast talkin'
Just garbage

I'm lightweight
I'm a lean 215
Routhless
Ready to leave a tooth
Or two missing
I'll put the heat in your mouth
Like a Hooters wing
And dunk shot
At the shot
Like playing hoops with Kareem

I'm blowing this king
Procede cautious
I eat [?]
CT's mine
Tell [?] office
Try to cross me
Arrestin' P
Son that [?]
Body full of low metal
The kanye [?]

You'll get injured
And I ain't playing around
One punch make that ass lay on the ground
If you didn't know before
Then I'm sayin' it now
Yes, I'm sayin' it now
That you're gonna get injured
And I ain't fucking with you
You can't touch me
Or anyone in my crew
You could just ask anybody
It's true
If I'm comin' for you
Then you're gonna get injured

(You'll get injured)
