[Tyga]
Uh... Lamborghini, you don't even see me
Bad bitch, no bikini takin shots of Henny
Order calamari, say she want that fettucini
Five-star bitches, my bitches don't eat at Denny's
HA~! Run the city, you runnin laps tryna get with me
I'm all in her +Redskin+, like I play for Washington
I'm five eight, but six ten, my dick stand like Superman
Shoulder lean that bitch, HA! Shoulder lean that bitch, HA!
Mills cause I'm hot, trigger finger keep that pussy wet
Bills in my fists, shawty she gon' dance on my dick
MILLS CAUSE I'M HOT, TRIGGER FINGER KEEP THAT PUSSY WET
BILLS IN MY FISTS, SHAWTY SHE GON' DANCE ON MY DICK

[Chorus]

[2Chainz]
(Yah... 2 CHAINZ!) Uh..
She got her booty cheeks on my Louie sheets (yah!)
She can do it on a pole, but can she do it on me? (uh)
Her flexin ass, let me see you flex that aaaaaaaaass
I don't call, I just text that ass about special bags
(Bro..) P-Python, all gold, no ice on
Nothing but shaved pussy in my iPhone (Damn!)
And this right here a no-fly zone
And you are not us, so don't try holmes
I buy cars, I buy homes, my antidote for my catapult
I'm up through there, foreign shoes, these a new pair
Chains on, this two pair, make ya girl buy new hair
Wear that pussy OUT~! ...like new gear - hoe

[Chorus]

[Tyga]
Fuck yeah bitch, throw it back, don't be scared of it
Fuck yeah bitch, throw it back, don't be scared of it
Fuck yeah bitch, throw it back, don't be scared of it
Fuck yeah bitch, throw it back...
Throw it back... (Yea..) Throw it back...
Throw it back... (Fat bitch) Throw it back...
(Yea, yea...) Throw it back...
(Thick bitch) Don't be scared of it

[Chorus]

[Outro: Repeat "Fuck it right, boy!" 'til end]</pre>
