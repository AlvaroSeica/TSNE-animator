Yeah this goes out for these funky ass bitches and
these trick ass niggaz you know what I'm saying..
cuz some of these niggaz be bitches too..
even your own best friend can turn into a bitch ass
nigga sometime so I'm sending this one out personally..

[Kingpin Skinny Pimp]
Now Chapter One of a Pimp A Bitch cost no shots
Running out the mouth she get her monkey ass popped
A good pimp is slick like a big boss
I put a charge to the train you wanna toss then you gotta pay the cost
Every show I go I got my hoes in the room
I tie her to the bed then I beat her with a broom
I'm never satisfied with ya hoe do they know what I mean
Go get me my money or get these Gators in your G-Strings
Most of the big pimps snotting coke thru they nose
Not me I keep my head straight I pop my kone and break they hoes..

[Chorus] w/ ad libs

[Kingpin Skinny Pimp]
Well it's the pimp nigga breaking on a bitch nigga
Drinking on some Crown clown watch me whip this dirty hoe down
I was raised to dog 'em all rush they head to the wall
If she come short with my trap I'm gon break her jaw
I'm one up from whipping these bitches
I'm whipping these bitches I'm feeling like they running game
To a nigga that taking no coke from a hoe
selling left of my change the broke out remains
To bring out the pain cuz all of my life
I been looking for some of the stoutest
So after this staying for the paper to stack
to buy it's for all we living the baddest
We living the villain they beg for the future
and that is forever I'm down with you hoes
I believe in you hoes so pick up my dough
no matter whatever just deal with this hoe..

[Chorus]

[Kingpin Skinny Pimp]
Be on the lookout for Skinny Tales taking these bitches mails
Saying these hoes names pimping they fucking brain
I broke all of them almost 50,000 was close
But anyway I got some more bitches I'ma roast
Like Tonya, and Renee, Sharee, and Baby
I left them hoes bankrupt I whip 'em like I was O.J.
And Riko you thought I was thru stinky bitch this part two
Put them sluts on they V.O. cuz what they do they like to chew
These bitches they mad and they talking that shit
cuz I'm telling the truth and I'm taking they bank
They bang from a trick and they may suck a dick
I'm buying my way and they making me rich
You dig it's all about stacking my chips
I'm busting they lips for that gravy don't play me
I'm crazy you run across them hoes tell them Skinny Tales coming soon...
