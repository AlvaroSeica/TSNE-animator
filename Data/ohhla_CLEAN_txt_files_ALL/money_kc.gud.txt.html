Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I woke up this morning, money on my mind
Bad bitches in my bed, trying to fuck, but I ain't got time
So I had to pack a set, jump straight in the shower
Told my plug I'll meet him in McDonald's in an hour
So I jump right in my truck, cut that chord a foe
Stop the gravis right, gotta get right, it's time to poke up
Wasting to the money, cell phone tripping
And a pistol on my lap while I'm riding and I'm working

I'm straight from the New Orleans
These bitches know balling
Got a scope on the riffle
I ain't missing none of my targets
And your girl said she wants all of me
And when I leave she follow me
I gotta get straight to the money
Bitch, I hear that paper calling me

Calling me, that money keep calling me
Calling me, that money, that money keep calling me
Calling me, that money keep calling me
Money keep calling, keep calling

I'm talking big money, big paper
Big gun with a layer laser
Dump you in a river now
The pigs will find you here later
I'm a New Orleans, a fake cater
Peels bury, I'm a brand maker
Got a nine, I call on Nina Ross
Aka that head breaker
You niggas is dead fakers
See before, that's so tight
Niggas getting money, living lovely
Nigga, fuck your life
Drink cotton, I'm using mine
Every day is when I use the shine
They call me The Mechanic
'Cause I'm walking 'round with this tool mine

I'm straight from the New Orleans
These bitches know balling
Got a scope on the riffle
I ain't missing none of my targets
And your girl said she wants all of me
And when I leave she follow me
I gotta get straight to the money
Bitch, I hear that paper calling me

Calling me, that money keep calling me
Calling me, that money, that money keep calling me
Calling me, that money keep calling me
Money keep calling, keep calling

Love my nervs back, gotta pass me the weed
I'm a cold hearted nigga, so I'm grabbing the heat
Throw some bullets at your ass, all my past is complete
I'll put a hole in your skull, Alexander McQueen
Man, motherfuck you and the name of your team
I'm laughing at you while I stab you, then I rape you and shit
I caught you by your girl's house, now you're bleeding on the lawn
I spit dope, I'm Cole Young, put this needle to your arm
I'm the hideous when it's cold, I be freezing when it's warm
Face it, I'm about to blow, like I'm sitting on a bomb, pause
Two wild bold niggas from the NOI, 6-6 douce parol, MOB

I'm straight from the New Orleans
These bitches know balling
Got a scope on the riffle
I ain't missing none of my targets
And your girl said she wants all of me
And when I leave she follow me
I gotta get straight to the money
Bitch, I hear that paper calling me

Calling me, that money keep calling me
Calling me, that money, that money keep calling me
Calling me, that money keep calling me
Money keep calling, keep calling</pre>
