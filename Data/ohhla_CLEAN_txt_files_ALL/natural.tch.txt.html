[Intro: Mela Machinko]
Oh-oooh-ohh, ohhh
Natural beauty, ooooh, so beautiful
Yeahhh, natural
Yeah!

[Immortal Technique]
They corrupted the priceless African image of Isis
Replaced it with a lifeless, anorexic white bitch
The fashion industry, got 'em in a funny spot
Self-hatred leakin out they mouth like a money shot
Movie star, Hollywood, Babylon fantasy
Bunch of peacock bitches. in a cocaine canopy
And if you healthy they make you think you're a manatee
Look how they invented this Eurocentric insanity
Got you brainwashed, to the point you bleachin your skin
Blind to the truth and can't see the beauty within
Cause ain't nuttin wrong with exercise to tighten your thighs
but there's somethin wrong with contacts that lighten your eyes
We're goin backwards, from hip-hop in the park
to the experiments, by Dr. Kenneth Clarke
So after the cannabis, I'ma have to handle this
Release the pressure on her and open her like an amethyst

[Chorus: Mela Machinko]
Their lies can't phase your beauty, you gotta know who you are
Stay strong and always remember, the truth in your heart
Don't forget there are those who, benefit from your scars
You can't deny, what's, natural

[Immortal Technique]
Yeah, yeah, check it, uhh
The business of beauty, isn't a natural model
It's built to be the opposite of the cultures we topple
These magazines got you caught in a hustle
Cause when you starve yourself, your body doesn't burn fat, it burns muscle
And men who don't even like women control the business
That's why the women look like men and the men like bitches
I break it down as God as my witness
Remember Sambo, caricature characteristics
Now who got the collagen under they lipstick?
Implanted Arabic hips, surgical sickness
A bi-polar society that claims to be righteous
Spray paintin artificial melanin tryin to be like us
Living in a pathetic epidemic of schizophrenics
Buying a synthetic body with credit
You mad that I said it, but you know that I'm right
Find the natural beauty and get you some natural love tonight

[Chorus]
