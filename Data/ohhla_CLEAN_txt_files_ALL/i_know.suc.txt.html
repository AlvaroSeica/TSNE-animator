[Chorus: Billy Cook]
See I know, a thug ain't the way to be
And I know, the streets ain't no place for me
And I know, these laws got a case for me
But who else gon' make a way for me, I know
Dear mama, I'm thugging

[Lil' O]
Fresh off of lock, and I'm back on the streets
And all that's on my mind, is get back on my feet
So my stomach and my back, but my back wanna eat
And two thousand years for a charge, I make that in a week
But the irony of it all, is I know it's a trap
And I promised to my mama, that I wouldn't go back
So I said I'm getting a job,be honest for stacks
But every time they look at my record, and see I sold crack
And the minute they see that, they don't show me no pity
So that proves, I was getting a good job with the city
And I'm so broke, I can't a stripper to show me her titties
And I use to have hoes, now they don't wanna fuck with me
Cause I'm broke and beat down, it's hurting my pride
And everyday that goes by, it's like I'm dying inside
I'm getting frustrated, to the point I fell out and cried
Cause when I say I stopped hustling, I knew that I lied

[Trae]
Everyday I be thugging, and I'm on my last leg
What the fuck I'm gon' do, when I get down on my last bread
Selling dope ain't for me, and a 9 to 5 ain't gon' get it neither
Me being broke, done got me certified as a block bleeder
Deep down I might be wrong, only God can help me to change
If you ain't Trae then don't judge me, cause you ain't felt my pain
What I'm suppose to tell my son, if I don't get out and get it
What I'm suppose to tell my son, if ain't nothing in my kitchen
I know to jail I'm headed, and one day I'm gon' regret it
It ain't no charging to the game, nigga I got fucked up credit
Mama be stressing daily, and I can't watch her suffer
So I'm gon' grind all through the night, to try to bo'guard my muscle
My life be complicated, everyday and I hate it
Consequences I'm facing, if it's my time I take it
Cause life itself be wrong, but yet I'm dealing with it
Heavenly father if it's a better place, go on and put me in it

[Chorus]

[Z-Ro]
I know, Z-Ro don't wanna go to the county jail no mo'
But I know doing what I be doing, it's either that or the graveyard bro
But sometimes a brother really wanna go, cause I know my T. Jones in the afterlife
I'm trying to keep it on the straight and narrow, but just to survive a nigga might gotta blast tonight
To get some cash tonight, that's a distance if unless I got my 4-fifth in my palm
Kick it with my nigga Tre Deuce smoking on the sticky green, trying to keep myself from dropping a bomb
Shit me and Den we done been friends to enemies, enemies back to friends
The root of all evil believe me, people never let you down cause your dividends
I know what I'm saying it ain't no time for playing, you can ask my dog Gray-Doe
The reason why we let magazines fly, and have to relocate and lay low
It's a part of life for a thug nigga and a drug dealer, at the same time
I can't blame nobody it's for mama sake, Z-Ro gotta beat some folks to make up for mine
One deep for real not because I wanna be, but because of all the shit I done done
And I'm so tired I feel like I'm dying, I can't even see myself in a little son
I ain't go no seeds ain't nothing but the drank and weed, it's just me till I'm D-E-A-D
And I know that the penitentiary ain't for me, but we'll see

[H.A.W.K.]
Now you done heard they story, now let me tell you mine
Every line in this rhyme, damn near got me crying
Lord will I ever shine, or will I lose my mind
Why all my partnas dying, or locked up doing time
I know the bible said it, I know because I read it
I know just where I'm headed, even though I might regret it
These streets got a hold of me, but they not controlling me
These streets have molded me, to be all I can be
That is my destiny, to leave these streets alone
That was the boy in me, but now the boy is grown
Into a grown man, and now I understand
That I'm a black man, and this is God's plan
Mama just keep on praying, and feel me when I'm saying
I hope you understand, my life's in God's hands
I know because of Pat, that you can not relax
Therefor I got his back, I gotta get these stacks
