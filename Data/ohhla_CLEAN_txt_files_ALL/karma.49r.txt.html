Jas Mace Verse

If you had three wishes, would it be on some materialistic selfishness
Or would it be a selfless wish
Benevolent and generous
Like a mother's kiss right after an accident
Hu, what does it matter well if you picked the ladder
Then I'll be on your right shoulder helping you get over
Because life ain't a bitch she's a princess
That ought to be cherished and spoiled at every instance
I can make you see the light with one stroke
Like a shinigami dropping his deathnote I'm no joke
And I'll return 10 fold for that bold deed
Helping out oldies and learning from history
I tallied up the good and bad so you better do right
Because one mistake could mean your life
I'm trife yeah I know, but I don't care
Because my name is good karma protected by righteous armor come on

Hook

Marchitect Verse

You put me out there and got caught like a hunter in his own snare
That he set with intentions to spare
Nothing in his grasps or reach
I'm coming back to get you that's the least of your worries
Because I know where you live, matter fact
Man I live in your crib
Because I live in your heart and I know what you did
Because I did it to your first I guess life's a bitch
Do unto others as you like to get did
Because once I come back to find you it's hard to get rid
Of me, I'm ugly but my timing is impeccable
You into doing evil then me and you, we're inseparable
I come around when you're doing exceptional
To bring you down and choke you out in my tentacles
Make you want to turn your life around, tomorrow
I'm drama, uh I'm bad karma

Hook

Karma Ah I'll get ya, ah ah I'll Get ya It's Karma
Ah I'll get ya, ah ah I'll get ya It's Karma
Ah I'll get ya, ah ah I'll get ya It's Karma
I got ya, I'm right there with ya It's Karma
Ah I'll get ya, ah ah I'll Get ya It's Karma
Ah I'll get ya, ah ah I'll get ya It's Karma
Ah I'll get ya, ah ah I'll get ya It's Karma
I got ya, I'm right there with ya It's Karma

Marchitect Poem

Yeah, you see the other day
I was fortunate enough to get to go down by the water
And I saw an old man sitting there
And we got to talking about karma
So he had a couple interesting things to say
It went like this
It takes a hook to catch a fish
Before the cook will fetch a dish
It takes a worm to kiss the hook
Before a hungry fish will look
A fisherman waits because he hates the feel
Of losing a meal to an empty reel
So he looks to the sea for his favorite wish
And a fish gets hooked by its favorite dish
It's Karma</pre>
