Song:   I Don't Give a Fuck
Typed by: iamomni dot com

(chorus)
I don't give a fuck about who you are
where you're from
what you are
where you're going
the things you do
the things you've done
or going to do
the crew you roll with

I keep the conversation shorter
in the ??? what's up
I jump start the motor
after ????
yapping they gums
nobody asked about the cash
what you keep in your stash
but phony niggas always quick to put they business on blast
when I go 'round the city dizzy as dots
and everybody about they money
and where they gettin it from
that they ringing it up
that they living it up
I don't buy the bullshit
I don't be giving it up
I don't really give a fuck unless I'm getting a cut
so just divvy it up
and stop bringing it up
talking 'bout you're balling and shit
and swimming in wealth
nigga lie so damn much you start believing yourself

(chorus)
I don't give a fuck about the car you drive
the house you bought
the money you stole
the people you shot
the drugs you deal
the heat in your glock
your beef with the cops
or ???
it's not my concern
I go for mine
I'm out for mine
look out for mine
if it came down to life it's like yours or mine
I go for mine
I'm out for mine

I'm through with listening to what you talkin' 'bout
I block you out like tunnel vision
play the song and drown the sound
clear my mind of all the clouds
let the voice inside me out
you see I'm always filthy rich
even when I'm down and out
and I remind you
fuck the label that you're signed to
your fan base and all the yes men that hide behind you
you could never reach the level that I climb to
your simple minded style
you could never do what I do
I'm deep rooted
immune to influence
more concerned with the vibe from my music than moving units in
sell you some illusion to confuse the stupid humans with
I'mma keep it dope and keep on hoping that you're using it
it's dozier
I close a
I told ya
it's the shit that make you lose your composure
you rollin' with us or what
everyone's invited and

(chorus)
I don't give a fuck about who you are
where you're from
what you are
where you're going
the things you do
the things you've done
or going to do
the crew you roll with
who you are
where you're from
what you are
where you're going
the things you do
the things you've done
or going to do
the crew you roll with

in certain situations different angles give you leverage
never got about a person heard me
people telling
driven by the need to know
I'm not always self-centered
I just write about predicaments I put myself in
message
delivered on an altar
who it may concern
you can read it if you want to
it's for those who love to learn
I still go through
turmoil it's
overwhelming
I can't help but let it vent out
sent out to a pen pal with no return address
this is for ???
I overlook the review
less you wanna trade facts don't criticize my art work
my heart pumps
bassline
idolize the hard work
when I'm right they never remember when I'm wrong
they never forget me
I never regret something I said
never regret something I said
?????

(chorus)
I don't give a fuck about who you are
where you're from
what you are
where you're going
the things you do
the things you've done
or going to do
the crew you roll with
who you are
where you're from
what you are
where you're going
the things you do
the things you've done
or going to do
THE CREW YOU ROLL WITH</pre>
