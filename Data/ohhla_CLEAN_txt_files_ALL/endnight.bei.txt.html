Song:   End of the Night
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Yeah
It's the end of the night girl
And I'm gonna make you feel good
Make you feel good...

Now that we're alone girl
Do every thing that we said that we would...

So lay ya body down down down
I'll make you say my name and
Try not to make a sound sound sound
My neighbors be complainin'

Yeah, yeah
It's the end of the night girl
And I'm gonna make you feel good (I promise)
Make you feel good...
(Girl we shouldn't be doin' this. Upside down)</pre>
