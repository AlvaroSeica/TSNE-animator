Typed by: AZ Lyrics

She got that good good
She Michael Jackson bad
So hit me with them cuffs Jackson yea

And I don't have to ask
Shorty gon give it to me
And now we high
I got more green than grounds keeper willy

Home girl now don't be silly
Let's come up to my city
They ask about me
My kick game be making FIFA envy
See that belly that ain't mine
If out of line
Had a woman bust it taking that matter right

I be getting scratched
So I must ask now wheres the calamine
And pussy is the shit but that don't mean I'm feening paper ya'll
Damn I'm fry
And I'm gone
She alright
Oh she gone
Please sugar don't come alone
And don't you bring your camera phone

I believe in prophecy
I beleive in honesty
That lieing on they jimmy
On they twiter right and I will see

I'm modest, and humble
My polo got no logos
Mr packy now I'm packing
Your vagina shall be kodo

I can party and I know 2-1-0
So whore hard and go go
Need a girl whos tryna ball
Cause I don't know we bag a logo

You is lofing no B.S.ing
Second guessing ever me
Never agree with that message
They say nothings ever free

Shit cause I'm an F-ing theft
Pop a pill
Get some tree
Get a glass and put chris on, yea
Just like mr. C, oh

No big baby
So give it baby
I'm verra waggin
No isn't baby

Don't mean to be impatient
But you should be in pagents
I got more hoes that tiger
Word to saget

I got that ganja itch
Loud addition purple patch
And bring some roll up
Bring a movie
Bring your friend
I got the mattress
Bring some cheedos
Bring some gum
And when you done I'll call that cab
And if you pay for that yourself
I promise I'm a call you back

All you bad
And all you cute
And I'm in awe
From all you do

But if I went and convolute
Do you think I would have called it to

Now though
Audible
Think I need another play
Let me call that hotel
She can't know where my mother stay

Now I'm straight
Let's consummate
Your girlfriend want to follow
She said kiss me on my lips if you wanna know how her vagina tastes

Ok, let me do it
Guess I see it's my turn
Ya'll wife and white knight her
I try to one night her
Heart break
I serve
To MCs that don't lie good

They think they bring that pain
Well I am percaset and vicodine
You work the bitch
I'm ballin
Something foreign
You get close but no cigar
Like the footballers from new orleans
I'm a manning
I'm a mansions
Or the Hamptons
We just went there
Put that lamp in
I'm in the middle of a bad bitch sandwich, yea
And they all lettuce
You all ketchup
And all this feta (cheese)
This time we all relish

And ya'll don't know no beef
This smourgus board is portabella
All I bump is Rockefeller
Rock nation

D.C., We propelling
You know I am not gon stop
I don't need no single
Like I'm only serving 20 rocks

No change
I won't Change
Fat drill
No bass
Three tits
Go head
Break a leg
Do what you must do
But while Like mr. Fiji in Hiku

Ya'll ain't fly
Ya'll ain't cool
Got shit dropped out, don't recoup
And I don't make no bed rock
I turn that mattress to a pool, Biotch

Ooh Baby
I Be Stuck To You, (hey)
Like Glue Baby, (like)
Wanna Spend It All On You, (I want it to feel like my song)
Baby, (hey)
My Room Is The G Spot
Call Me Mr. Flintstone
I Can Make Your Bed Rock
I-I-I I Can Make Your Bed Rock (Hey)
I-I-I I Can Make Your Bed Rock Girl (hey rock nation what's up)
I-I-I I Can Make Your Bed Rock (young money what's up
Rock nation what's up)
I-I-I I Can Make Your Bed Rock (let's go)</pre>
