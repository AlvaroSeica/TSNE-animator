"Science"
"Friction"
Test, test, test
"Science"
{*scratching*}
"Uh hun..."
"Friction"
One, two, three
"Science"
{*scratching*}
"Uh hun..."
"Friction"
One, two, three
One, two, three

[Verse 1: Simon Sez]
Science friction
The science of listenin'
Mixin' noise, tall tales
Advanced technology
Follows me with no apology
Steve, Jobs, keeps callin' me
For text support
It's a no brainer
I'll pull your card like a Pokemon trainer
Simon Sez, the cosmic Casanova
Stay sharp by overdosing ginkgo biloba ("Go..")
I fold time and space in half
I got a velvet dash inside my hovercraft
Do the math
Equations equal paragraphs
I drink sulfuric acid by the carafe
I got a high aptitude, a few
This test tube dude's always in a bad mood
I'm nude
Under my white lab coat
I use a telescope to watch every note
Flow by
I'm always in disguise
Cause I know every secret plan the government denies ("Go..")
I play with toys that make noise
I'm not a B-boy, I'm a droid on 'roids
I'm the one who built Dexter's Laboratory
That young punk tryin' to steal my fame and glory
My story
Started with a Big Bang
Now fast, from Penang to the Sudan, when I hang
With the professor
The west coast professor
I spit microchips, flip microprocessors
In takes
I communicate with the greys
My drum breaks
Cause quakes and dry lakes
Pinch a fifth, it's a computer glitch, quick
I got pimps and players getting itched
Throw the switch
Skyler's just lit its
To look inside my head, point and click

"Go..."
One, two, three

"Go..."

(Verse 2)
[Spitball]  It's science friction, we been through the future
            Generations to come and look back and wonder
            How The Earthquake Institute
            Did what they did
            Seismologist trip like Den hits the cid
            It was off the grid, the invisible mist
            Knock down buildings, everybody screams
            When they heard the boom
[Simon Sez] It was one big boom
[Spitball]  Causin' monsoons while they touched the moon
            I'd say, "We're comin' soon," but we been here twice
            Turn tables over there by the laboratory mice
            When we tried the formula
            It was so powerful
            One drop caused heart attacks from here to Antartica
            It went dark, we blew apart the sea
            With more power than Freeza in Dragon Ball Z
            You see
            The prophets couldn't convince
            The world we were invisible
            It got critical
            Harbor metaphysical DNA criminals
            You swear to Buddha, we came from out of space
            But we been in the place
            Brains without faces
            Manipulate breaks in the early stages
            Of production
            First phase, the cuttin'
            Second phase, the mix
            Last phase, destruction
            Simon, push the button
            It's not fiction
[Simon Sez] "What is it?"
[Spitball]  It's science friction
