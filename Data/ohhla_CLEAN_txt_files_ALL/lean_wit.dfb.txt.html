[repeat 8X]
Lean wit it, rock wit it!!

[Verse 1]
I bounce in the club so the hos call me Rocky
Posted in the cut, and I'm lookin for a blockhead
Yup in my white tee
I break a bitch back
And I keep a big bank
Oh I think they like dat
Before I leave the house I'm slizzard on the goose
And I'm higher then a plane so a nigga really loose
And I can lean wit it (lean wit it)
And I can rock wit it (rock wit it)
And if you gotta friend
She gotta suck a cock wit it!

[Verse 2]
Ay gon and rock wit it (gon rock wit it)
Gon and lean wit it (gon lean wit it)
Rock so damn hard, you break your spleen wit it (u break your spleen wit it)
Pull up ya jeans wit it (pull up ya jeans wit it)
Smoke some green wit it (smoke some green wit it)
And the spot ain't crunk bitch if we ain't in it
If you don't wanna do it, then I'll make you dance
Perfect example watch me make your face beat up my hands
When you see me hit the spot, betta watch dat boy
Charlay, from the road wit them franchize boyz

[repeat 8X]
Lean wit it, rock wit it!!

[Verse 3]
I'm too clean to wanna pop lock
From left to right A nigga lean
Vibin to the beat Check my feet

Everytime the beat drop
Lean wit it Rock wit me
Freeze 'fo yo fingers pop
Purlpe leen purple green grams in my sock

Old school people pat cha feet

[Verse 4]
Shit I'm pimpin in the club
Til the hoes start to act up
Cuz they see my chain
And a nigga throwin them stacks up
I keep a full clip and my pistol in my pants
I'm in the middle of the flo'
They screamin NIGGA DO YA DANCE!!
You can roll yo arms (roll yo arms)
And just put 'em in rotation (rotation)
Go side to side
