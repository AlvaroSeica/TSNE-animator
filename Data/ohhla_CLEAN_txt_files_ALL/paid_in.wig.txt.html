[Shawn Wigs]
Aiyo, I came in the door, I said it before
The 45 King that's prepared for the war
Guns galore, quarters on my armored truck
I got, suing dutch, if you looking to get stuck
My team is crooked just like a St. Ides drink
That's why we gully, big 4-5 under the mink
And my wings stink, just like hazy coffee
Your styles just as hard as Mr. Softee
Bunch of cone heads and rainbow sprinkles, be talking that stack money
But got a few hundred in singles
I break the bank, push a tank, rock a half and million dollar time piece
Paid in full, there's no cheats
Check the sheets, my bankroll, is crazy dookie
I said my bankroll's dookie, large like Mr. Drummings
Shove my, dick in your ear, so ya'll can hear me 'cumming'
This is Theodore, 718, get ready for the likes and the presence of an all time great
I'm just thinking of a master plan, so many scams
Got your girl butt naked just cutting up grams
Telling me... I know, baby, you make me feel good too</pre>
