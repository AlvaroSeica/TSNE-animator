Chucky Smash Now close your eyes..visualize and see what we be

seeing...eveident with the evidence...nobody be 
freeing...wisdom...release your mind..bitches rockin Calvin 
Klein..confined to watchin rewinds of Martin on channel 9... where
the 
blind lead the blind, destination to the boulevard..blessed to be 
fresh...beatboxin' like M&amp;R...flashback..to Cold 
Crush...Easy A.D.in...I used tyo rock the tube sox...aye yo, my box
was 
JVC an nowaday, these Childs wanna live like Mr. Kevin....o.t.
with mad 
g's...push a 7 or a Legend.....Yo, was 
it the buddas?...stick up niggas with 17 shooters...but they don't 
understand till they're three time losers...Chucky Smash...I be killin 
em...I hit em with the minimum...then I start 
smackin em...I take em to the maximum...level..you retreat,
complete 
back pedal....The Microphone Lord...I'm steppin off with a bad
broad 

YO, MY GLARE IS BLINDING...GOT A KNACK FOR
FINDING.....CURENCY FOR 
SHINING...DOLLAR SIGNS AND DIAMONDS....SKY'S
THE LIMIT..YO, WE LIVE IT, 
NEVER BE TIMID...CAUSE REAL NIGGAS DON'T FAKE
IT... CAUSE REAL NIGGAS 
LIVE IT 

Chi I layed low for six years...was in no rush to drop an album..still 
got g's and car keys...wasn't stressed without one...yo wonder how
come 
I ain't rappin and I'm stayin creamy...ladies 
love me and I'm peelin Franklins when you see me... up in the
Tunnel, at 
Esos, even the Mirage....I bag up models at expos and we menage 
trois...no, I'm no star but my aura and my 
jewels are gleamin...and now I'm driving so I'm keepin lifestyles
filled 
with semen...No yall aint dreaming...It's Chi Ali..I'm back to 
stay...and dare niggas say some shit I think is wack 
today...my record label drop me..but that shit still ain't stop me..It 
got me mad so I had to go o.t. and cop me..a diamond stud and a
fat ass 
cuban link...be stayin laced cause I just refuse 
to sink..or fall off and now I'm back to set it all off..yea..me and my 
niggas rentin floors in the Waldorf Cie Lo Now I'm holding more
records 
than Tower..when I reign..do more than 
shower..No baking soda, come back story - I devour...delete,
destroy - 
prime time, by the hour - Grand Rapids - never delt with
coke...barely 
touch flour...Torn from the seam...born in my 
genes to get the cream like noxem - shine like oil sheen....Niggas in 
this game with that in-expensive talk...while I'm out buying property
- 
real estate - and side walks...I elevate at a rate 
that's heavy weight...straight from the state where we chop it and 
break...the Legion see...we click on all cylinders...o.t. locking
blocks 
and holding down Dillingers 

HOOK 

Cules Check it..To get what I got in my possession...I had to use
some 
aggression dealin in my profession...My compliance with my clients
is to 
a science...I'm only dealin with giants 
because I'm forming an alliance....They call me Molecules..you
know the 
rules..I paid my dues...back in the day..I walk the streets with 
.22's.....now, It's different times and different 
weathers...so now I rock the block with glocks under butter soft 
leather...Although I changed my flow..I'm about gettin doe..but on
the 
low..I don't think these niggas know we about to 
blow...Now we're pushin limos...me and my Legion team...kickin
the 
breeze...sippin on Dom P...Remy on freeze...I went from sportin
Swatches 
to Cuban links around my neck...Sub 
Mariner Rolex..Assault mix made by Avirex....Yo Dres...These
petty 
motherfuckers is small in the mind...they will find it's time for Black 
Sheep and the Legion to shine....And fuckin 
with me is like snortin a ki of lines...ya better off bustin yourself 
with a million nines.... cause my mind is on pushin weight and
dicking 
dimes and your mind revolves on sippin three 
dollar bottles of wine</pre>
