[Intro]
[King Tee] Give me some more volume..
[Boss Mack] King Tee, pass me that drink, nigga
[Boss Mack] All you motherfuckering pimps
[King Tee] (*Toke*) Woow, ha ha

[Boss Mack]
All you motherfuckers, cause this is motherfucking..
All the motherfuckers, cause this is motherfucking..
All the motherfuckers, cause this is motherfucking..
All the motherfuckers, cause this is motherfucking..

[King Tee] Alright, we got it

[Chorus: Boss Mack]
Gangsters, whores, alcohol, drugs, ecstasy, blow
It's a wild life, wild out niggaz let it go
Gangsters, whores, alcohol, drugs, ecstasy, blow
It's a wild life, wild out bitches let it go

[Verse 1: King Tee]
Hold up!
The sin sets in a smoke filled room
And all the Rotwelliers hollering at the moon
Someone is coming, with eight karat diamonds on his jewels
(Who was that?) the rebirth of the cool
Finally resurrected, with the game of life profected
Cause the strain of my voice gets noised on the record transmitting
That nigga takes a blow and keeps ticking
The Hop-Hipping, balling nigga from the Liks and
Now listen, if you fuck back in your Coup√©
Roll around your neighborhood finna hit the loop
Just react, throw your neighborhood like that
Whoever set trip gets ripped off the map
Take precautions, when you're at that light launch coughing of the herb
Macking at them whores on the curb
Bump this, now you're feeling paused up, ain't ya?
My name is King Tee, I'd like introduce you to some fucking to..

[Chorus: Boss Mack]

[Verse 2: King Tee]
Uhh, King Tee, I spit the game since I came out
I'm from the city where them niggaz known to bang out
And everyday we hit the town, pull the Range out
King Tee, the master plan in turning the game out
Making money is in my blood
I started from nothing to coming up, nigga what?
Perusing my dreams for bigger thing
Wild in the being, bitches get stuck, got ball in the bling
About ten Karats how old in the ring
Niggaz hate cause their bitch bow to the King
And down to do the damn thing
Feel me nigga? - I gots to keep it gangster
Cause player haters hate a nigga with paper
And fuck you haters, I be doing the majors
And make it happened like ticking the lakers
And how you figure, you can stop the dude?
Cause I'm a vet at this shit and got a lots to pull
So keep it gangster

[Chorus: Boss Mack]

[Verse 3: Boss Mack]
Yo, yo, yo, this shit is whore can't start it out
Young niggaz seen too much
Young Buck had dreams and really living it up
But it was just an older dude tapping green too much
Hundred stacks, gold money, they done cleaning it up
Ride for the coast, die for the coast and pose
This is real life, nigga, you can't press pause
I saw the rough, real tough, ragged and raw
Down in the place they call the gutter, maybe tougher than all
My own grandpopps was a fiend chasing the Rock
Take a big hit, waiting for the pain to stop
Basically, these streets awaking me, I mean mistaking me
Now, I'm standing straight into the face of the beast
You can't be ready, Freak Freddy, the Boss speak heavy
And ride whores like the scretch nutty
We're at the hotel waiting for the paper to come
Break the bread and take the shit like Big Pun
And it don't cheat us..

[Chorus: Boss Mack]</pre>
