(Happy P &amp; Grimm talking)
What up loc, we holding it down
But anyway, what's up, bitches, niggas
And them bitch ass niggas, everybody
We the Lone Star Ridaz, representing the Lone Star State
That's Texas, front your do' motherfuckers
But anyway, Grimm, what's up my nigga
(what up, what up Hap) what's up bwoy
(been a long time coming huh, Latin Sector
You know, to that aggravated, if you don't know
Most Hated, and they look now, the Lone Star Ridaz
And everywhere we go baby, they looking at us
All the Mexicans, them essays) sick motherfuckers
(essays starting it from the beginning to the end baby)
Here we go...

[Grimm]
Ever since what, '89 I put the pen on loose leaf
The only Mexican in black clubs with groupies
Who see, the same round groupies and baselines
G-R-I double M, got this game mine
Slayed down from scraps, raps ran over tracks
And for that quick to cap, niggas giving me dap
Pimp smacks to strap packers, what no Latin rappers
Switched the game up straight fucked, back sackwards
Bastards, never knew what him at first
Not to laughter, he was making the matter worse
And we recite Man, Balasso, Shadow, Filero
Some breaking bread, others have no dinero
Sad though the ghetto, was feeling us from the front
Fucked up cause we kept it crunk, and who would of thought
That Mexicanos out the Gulf Coast, keep it to the utmost
Some though boys that been hating, them boys cut throat
Buck holes, get your jealous niggas your organs
Look no bided, and look how many to follow you
The fars back days boys, yesterday's boys
Telling em get up get out, and get your game boy (game boy)
It ain't hard, nothing to it, but to do it
If you knew it, I knew it
Make you think twice, bout that G life
We respect the Jesus Christ and why he died
Now be applied, hope this game get you soked up
Been loced up, since Aggravated and then we broke up
But hold up, then the Most Hated came to the rescue
Lone Star Ridaz, do his thang and smoking left fool

[Chorus: Rasheed &amp; Russell Lee - 4x]
Now if you feeling this
Go and turn it up a little louder
So what you saying what
So what you saying what</pre>
