Song:   How to Listen, Part 1
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

This is a how to listen program
How to listen:
Including how not to
How you ought to
And how you won't

Could tell us what Hi-Fi is?
Hi-Fi?
Why Sure!

I think I can tell you what hi-fi is...
What-what-what-what is it?
Hi-fi? Hi-fi? Hi-fi is...

Hi-Fi is sound reproduction
From an instrument that has been specially designed
From the tur-tur-turn table
And-and-and-and-and I saw records made...
Music literally written in wax

[Music Interlude] (Ahhhh-ahhhh-ahhh)

This is a how to listen... program
Including how not to
How you ought to
And how you won't

How

Furbish wax is put on the tur-tur-turntable
A cutting point called a stylist is adjusted
And everything is ready to record again
The most popular selection ever caught on wax

Well... What would you say to a person like
A do it yourself hi-fi enthusiast like yourself?

Oh-oh-oh-oh it doesnt take much

Only money, A thorough knowledge of electronics
(Ahhhh-ahhhhh-ahhh)

Your wife's threatened to leave you
But, if you want re-re-re-re-real hi-fi!

Eee-ooooooo-eeeeeee

(Real-real-real-real-real-real)

Real hi-fi!
Eeeeee-ooooooooo-eeeeeeeeeee
R-r-r-r-r-r-r-real hi-fi!
Eeeeeee-oooooooooooooo-eeeeeeeeeee
R-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-real hi-fi!</pre>
