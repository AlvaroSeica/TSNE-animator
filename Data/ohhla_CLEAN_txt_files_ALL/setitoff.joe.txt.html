[Joe Mafia]
I got my mind on my money, and money on my mind
I got an alpine eighth of that Billy G, fahreinheit
Sit in the whip, fresh pair of Air Force One kicks
Hopping out a big Hoop dog, Lex, we stunting
Flirting with some modeling chicks, Myrtle Beach birds
Heineken and Hennessey fifths, got my speech slurred
Hating niggas willing my shit, I gangsta lean on 'em
Trey pound, bulging my hip, flash C.R.E.A.M. on 'em
Dog it wasn't always like this, I went through for it
Niggas got killed for this shit, some went to jail for it
So I give it back to the block, so when I get it up
For days, when my face stay twisted up, I live it up
Soon in a hood near you, guaranteed
Ain't no scared money, niggas that pug, spending cheese
Rock around the clock, toasted off of shots of Hennessey
It ain't greed, it's the need for speed, true indeed

[Chorus 2X: Joe Mafia]
Set it off, on the street, ya'll
Set it off, on the kite, ya'll
set it off, if beef come, then I'mma let it off

[Joe Mafia]
All Day I Dream About Sex, six digit figures and flex
And just lumps in my Nautica sweats
Going to the rest, a cat and a mouse
A beem to the head and I'm out, drink a Guinness Stout, a six, I'm out
Niggas thats ride and slide time, know what I'm talking bout
Vile smooth of ounce of that, stick move, bounce it back
Messing with them out of cats'll get your nuts cut
For sure, if you ain't got cash flow, acting like your slow
Corn ball niggas, I told y'all, stay out my business
Rather lay up with them pigeons to get it, got to sick 'em
Dyslexic, flipping minor numbers, sometimes I wonder
How they trynna get back, I max up a supper luncheon
Valentino Rossi on Bigotti's, what can stop me, nothing
Got my mind set, from the projects, no time for fronting
Sliding off, jetting in the kind of weather, Oli North
Alls get it straight from the source, plugging, we taking yours

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
