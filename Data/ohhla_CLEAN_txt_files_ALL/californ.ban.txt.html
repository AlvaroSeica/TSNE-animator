[Kree]
In Californication

[David Banner] + (Snoop Dogg)
Yeah, bitch I'm from the country but that don't make a nigga soft
Big city niggaz come south and get their wigs knocked off
Tell me, I just hustle and flow
Find a track to start and pimp on a ho
The block got hot a nigga, had to get low
Get the fuck out of dodge and hit my uncle on the East side
Treyvon (Whattup neph? What's crackin?)
I wanna visit L.A., I'm already packed
Been already stacking so we gonna get turned up
(Soon as you land, purple kush gonna get burnt up)
Shit, the next day I'm at LAX
Uncle Trey pulled up in a Camaro SS
Black on black, sitting on 23s
Bumping Rich Boy like bitch Throw Some D's
2 bad bitches in the back seat, one of them for me
Mexican mami name Marie
Rolling up some trees on the 1-0-5 east
Roll down the window, just to feel the breeze
It's real nice, feeling like paradise (sheesh)
And all I can see is sunshine and palm trees

[Chorus: Kree]
Welcome to Californication
Welcome to Californication

[David Banner] + (Snoop Dogg)
Where we goin? (To the hood)
Now I wanna see the swap meet, Crenshaw and Slauson
(Fool, that's where the cops be)
(Nigga, I ain't got no driver's license or insurance)
Sure enough the cops put us over on Torrance
Everybody out the car, the cops set us on the curve
They searched the ashtray and found a roach full of herbs
What's this in that cigar? (Medical marijuana officer)
(I got a weed card) What condition you smoke weed for?
Treyvon Jones, place your hands behind your back
You're under arrest for warrants go to court in Torrance Monday
Monday? It's Wednesday man
Or maybe Tuesday, you heard me ma'am
Now if you keep it up, I'll arrest you for obstruction of justice
Trey like "Take the car, fuck this"
(Have fun, call my homies, go clubbin with your dumb ass)
(At least they ain't found my gun stash)

[Chorus: Kree]
Welcome to Californication, you might come for vacation
Welcome to Californication, you might leave on probation
Welcome to Californication, everyone knows, anything goes
Welcome to Californication, in Californication

[David Banner] [Nipsey Hussle] [Ras Kass] [Snoop Dogg]
I dropped the bitches off, now I'm off to my uncle house
Stopped by the liquor store, nothing but the thugs out
White tees and Chucks when niggaz hit me up like

[Ras] Where you from homie?
[Ban] Lifted up his shirt on me, chrome 4-5
And dawg I wasn't strapped another would walk up like
[Nip] Nah, he cool, that's Dave Black, Tray lo folks
Visiting from Mississippi
[Ban] Pass the pint of Hennesey
[Nip] here sip this with me
I'm Javon, we're gonna get it poppin tonight
Wassup? Hollywood around, these niggaz are flockin at night
[Ban] What's flockin?
[Nip] Breakin in homes, B and E
[Ras] Burglary nigga, damn you slow
[Ban] Oh, we kicked it in the hood drinkin smokin kush twist up
Hood rat with the big butt shows up got our dicks up
Kissed my auntie on the cheek see you later
Now we 5 niggaz deep and Javon's Navigator
The club's off the chain, I'm seeing models and stars
NBA players straight buying out bars
The state of Arizona tryna segragate
But my dick don't discriminate
Black girls, white girls, pimping I just like girls
California Girls, Katy Perry dyke girls
Met an Asian with fake tits next to a hype girl
She took a pot of that, sniffing on that white girl
V.I.P. bottles and all that
This unbranded nigga started pouring out cognac
I said "Pimpin what you doin'?" He said fuck you too
And that's the last thing he do and
I took a bottle and I cracked that nigga, smacked that nigga
Security bust me like arrest that nigga
Tearin up the club, all 5 of us
Asian bitch grab me like hurry up slide with us
But the cops were outside stopped her, detained me
Found some coke in her purse, motherfuckers blame me
Next thing you know I'm in the county jail
I walked in the cell, my uncle Trey is right there
And he's just shakin his head then he laughed at a nigga
[Snp] Don't pee in the bed
Don't let the bright lights fool ya and lay you tricky place
[Ban] It's been 24 hours I just caught my first case

[Kree]
I'm just here to see the Hollywood sign get locked up
Niggaz doin crazy, tribe lights get popped up
As they trippin on me for no reason
Jail politics, county niggaz in season

[Chorus: Kree]
Welcome to Californication, you might come for vacation
Welcome to Californication, you might leave on probation
I'm telling you that
Welcome to Californication, anyone goes, everything goes
Welcome to Californication, in Californication</pre>
