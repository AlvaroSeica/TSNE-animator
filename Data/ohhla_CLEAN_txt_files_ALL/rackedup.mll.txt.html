Typed by: AZ Lyrics

It's MMG
All my niggaz strapped up and racked up
It's a lifestyle nigga
Racked up Shawty, Racked up Shawty
All these bitches call me Racked up Shawty
Racked up Shawty, Racked up Shawty
All these bitches call me Racked up Shawty
Racks all of my wrists, racks all on my neck
I spend racks all on my bitch
Look at these racks all on my check
Nigga I'm racked up and I racked out
Fuck the bitches she tap out
Fuck a bitch and I pass out
My pockets on j Stackhouse
Cause I ball hard I'm swagged out
All black maybach's out
You'll niggaz just been shit
And I live shit that I rap 'bout
These racks came from my crack house
Dirty money like Diddy
Hammers niggaz ain't never seen
Got thirty off in that fifty
Now tell them hoes that I'm busy
Tell them hoes that I'm balling
I done fucking ain't answered once
Now why this hoe keep calling
You'll niggaz be fowling
Acting like you all got it
That shit you call your stash nigga
That's racks off of my pocket

Racked up Shawty, Racked up Shawty
All these bitches call me Racked up Shawty
Racked up Shawty, Racked up Shawty
All these bitches call me Racked up Shawty

My shoes cost me a rack
My outfit off the rack
My presidential Rowley
I'm calling that Barack
Damn I meant Barack, too much Ciroc
Won't catch me and that passenger
That's word to Pac
That's word to Big
Rest in peace to the legends
We kill niggaz for the acting
Rest in peace all them legends
Catch me in that Aston
I'm what's up fuck asking
They talk behind my bitch back
They must have seen her ass then
From H town like the astro, score card her ass ten
Pop pills no aspirin like a ski slope in Aspen
It's going down, it's going down
Now I brought my ski racks
Niggaz know my flow cold
So I don't ride I ski tracks

Racked up Shawty, Racked up Shawty
All these bitches call me Racked up Shawty
Racked up Shawty, Racked up Shawty
All these bitches call me Racked up Shawty

Black Ferrari, blacked out
Black Friday, Black Map
Popping spade blackjack
Bitch I'm hotter than fish grease
Made 250 this week
Baddest bitch all in balling bitch ball center
Ass fat, can't sit straight
Bought her like green blake
Chain blue and white penn state
Touring off of mixtapes
Racked up Shawty, Chain by forty
Came here with one bitch, left here with forty
Shout my hommie Meek Mill
Shout my hommie Fabo
Bellow the crib Cup Mill
I ain't trying to brag hoe
That coke boy that Mayback
That bad boy that stay strap
That ghosts fuck that Mayback
Baddest whores say that

Racked up Shawty, Racked up Shawty
All these bitches call me Racked up Shawty
Racked up Shawty, Racked up Shawty
All these bitches call me Racked up Shawty</pre>
