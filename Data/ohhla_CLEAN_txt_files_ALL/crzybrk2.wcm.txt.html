[DJ Crazy Toones scratching quotes below]
UHH! ~ in your ass motherfucker!
Here, here they go, Pure black
Bitch; I got them bomb ass tapes
DJ Crazy Toones, get funky with it!
I'm trying to ease your mind
I wanna know - Who's you?
One of the city smartest guys.. all time craziest
Now here we go, y'all gotta play this (WHY?!)
Excuse me, I'm trying to ease your mind!
Oh, I made a mistake!
Errors like this must be handled smoothly
This is the mark of the professional!</pre>
