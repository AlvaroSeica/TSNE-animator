[Verse One]
Yo, yo, in El Cuidad they don't
Tires smoke
Shorties on the sideline, heat under they coat
I split a cantaloupe and watch 
The drama on my block, enjoying every juicy drop
Keepin' my eyes out for the cop
Will this shit ever stop? I doubt it
The Devil is highly touted
The righteous man that wanders is eventually rerouted
In the opposite direction, reflection, interspection
Wickedness will have your soul trapped in a burning fence and
I'm relent-in'
The hustle is so temptin'
You can quote my sentence
We ain't about no pimpin'
I'd rather be ascendin'
Rearrangin' patterns
Programmed by the slave master
Can you fathom?
Life with Eve and Adam
Before the serpent had 'em
I return to my sender, revolve like rings around Saturn (echo)
Survive

[Chorus] [x2]
Ain't it a pity
That you hate this city
But the way you feel, ain't no big deal
You got to survive
You got to survive
You got to survive
And that's 
"The real!" - Gang Starr 'You Know My Steez'

[Verse Two]
Dark streets, swole feets, with massive trash heaps
Few speak, most weep, the sorrow, runs deep
Eat pain, sleep pain
Escape through cocaine
Come back, get smacked by life
Late lane
Want more need less, the stress, maintains
One day lose track, in fact, lose brains
End up, laid up, in a hospital no name
Just numbers on your chest, the vest, you wanna scream
But there's no one there to sympathize 
The doctor, you despise 
You never had love for I-N-I
Now the dope returns and the hatred burns
And you bury yourself deeper in the earth like a worm
It's your turn
Take a look at yourself
Don't be too preoccupied by everybody else

"Ghettos are the same all over the world. They stink." -Enter The Dragon

[Chorus] [x2]
Ain't it a pity
That you hate this city
But the way you feel, ain't no big deal
You got to survive
You got to survive
You got to survive
And that's 
"The real!" - Gang Starr 'You Know My Steez'

[Verse Three]
The tales of a dark mental, shakin' like Jello
Someone was giggin'
I told him not to leave himself open, evil is hidden
In the cracks and crevasses
Crannies, cuts and nooks
So I sit on my hopstetter and write hooks
? like what it is, look at miss
She's really a mister with blister all on his lips
It's his biz
Can't judge what it is
But I know the woman to woman ain't havin' no kids
And man to man yo, ain't havin' no kids
I pray to the father to come and show me what it is
And take all my crust from out my eyelids
I never did a bid and I won't get scared

[Chorus] [x2]
Ain't it a pity
That you hate this city
But the way you feel, ain't no big deal
You got to survive
You got to survive
You got to survive
And that's 
"The real!" - Gang Starr 'You Know My Steez'

"It's really real" - Nonchalant '5 O'Clock'
"In the concrete jungle" - A Tribe Called Quest 'Midnight'</pre>
