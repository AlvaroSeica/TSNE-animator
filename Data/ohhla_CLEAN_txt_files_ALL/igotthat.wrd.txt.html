I got that gangsta shit, cause I'm a gangsta biiiitch
I got that playa shit, cause I'm a playa biiiitch...

[Chris Ward]
I don't rehearse a lot, and I don't curse a lot
Whenever I lay some'ing down, my verse is hot
It's like when I'm under pressure, the worst come out
Yeah just like that, the worst come out
I grind everynight, whether it's the first or not
Knock boys out like a 4-4, bursting shots
Well go 'head, call the surgeons and the nurses out
Oops my bad, the paw bearers and hearses out

[Hook - 2x]
I got that gangsta shit, cause I'm a gangsta biiiitch
I got that thuggish flow, cause I'm thuggish hoe
I got that playa shit, cause I'm a playa biiiitch
I got that hustler flow, cause I'm a hustler ya know

[Chris Ward]
You see I rap, like it's Christmas time
Shine harder than your neighborhood nigga, during Christmas time
You hear a flow, that's a Chris design
I got 'em rushing to the sto', like J's half off at Finish Line
The rhyme rhythm is ratical, I make a mack fanatical
Me and my mathematicals, are so damn compatible
Everything that comes to my hands, got a price on it
Whether it's a 4 or a zone, with a touch of spice on it
The Coupe look nice don't it, when I'm hogging the lane
Like a tour bus, trying to flood the city with pure dust
Balling symptom so sick, they can't possibly cure us
Next year it's M-S fashion, Belour crush
So shhhhhh, keep that on the hush
Cause I think I just told y'all, a little too much
My lyrical lectures, are so infectious
Blend in like mega-plectures, with all the extras
My jewelry light up the night, like bicycle reflectors
That's why hoes call and harass me, like bill collectors
So please believe, believe me please
I be on the block from dust to dawn, like I got all-nighters disease

[Hook]

[Chris Ward]
See I'm a gangsta, full time playa
Big balling, all about my paper
See most girls that come to my shows, stand in line
Whether they love me, or they just some fan of mine
They all be like, Whodie how can we be down
I be like, you already are cause damn you so fine
Most hoes that say they know me, really get to know me
Once they know that I'm gone, get it nigga they know me

(*talking*)
You don't get it do you, ya heard me nigga they know
I got that playa shit, cause I'm a playa bitch</pre>
