I lamp on the corner selling bootleg tapes
Rappers collect breaks so that I make papes
I don't give a fuck about Kane or Biz
Finally, somebody beats The Wiz
And that somebody is me
Catch me around three, and I'll be busy as a motherfucking bee
Call five-0 and let 'em know
I'm selling bootlegged tapes, and they'll say... so?
My brothers in rap
Are gonna have to keep comin' up off the trap
'Cause I'm a salesman on the street
You know what to do if you can't stand the heat - can't eat
Vacate the kitchen with your bitchin'
I specialize in reproducin' tapes over Wild Pitchin'
If stupid people buy 'em, I'll continue to supply 'em
For $4.99, you can't complain about the volume
'Cause it's a bootlegged tape
And it's money I'ma make

Check it

I'm busy bootleggin'
I'm busy bootleggin'
I'm busy bootleggin'

Now I'ma tell ya something about yaselves

Now all you people claim you're all about loot
But when it comes to tapes, everyone takes the escape route
So I take advantage; and rappers sit and wonder how I manage
To do millions of dollars of damage
I'm hustlin' ya tapes out of crow[?]
And on my pole, sales go: brand new to gold
Instead of cryin' up an ocean
Record people need to hire brothers like me to do promotion
The ghetto entrepreneur, make Crazy Eddie feel like manure
Discontinue his store
And, yo, the president can't stop it
'Cause I got mega-presidents before his ass in my pocket
Let the IRS ask for tax
I'll just make tracks, no haps; I can relax
And keep slinging tapes that are garbage
And like Goldilocks watch the people eat 'em like they were porridge
'Cause it's a bootlegged tape
And it's money I'ma make 

I'm busy bootleggin'
I'm busy bootleggin'
I'm busy bootleggin'

'Cause it's a bootlegged tape
And it's money I'ma make

I'm busy bootleggin'
I'm busy bootleggin'
I'm busy bootleggin' 
I'm busy bootleggin'
I'm busy bootleggin'
I'm busy bootleggin'</pre>
