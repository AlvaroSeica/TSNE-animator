[Bajah] + (Rubix)
Yeahhhh (this the high life)
I said we're livin the high liiiiife
(Call it my life, hey)
Yeahhhh (woo!)

[Rubix]
This the byproduct of beautiful love
Fit like a glove, what's good, my people thought that we could
get it, you know we should, holdin like it's a grudge
Submerged, man I just surf

[Talib Kweli]
I'm writin a universe
But the stars don't fit in my bars, I'm too mega
This the fruit of my labor, my plate is full of color
Arugula, rutabaga, share the food with my neighbor
Truly innovative like Fela Kuti and Ginger Baker

[Rubix]
Yeah; moon raker, sun scraper, give you fire for the papers
Take you higher on the vapors, sire of the flavor
Designer of the caper, executive executor
Direct when I'm on path flight of a Navigator
Plight of a savior

[Talib Kweli]
Now what would Jesus do?
How you believe in Him? You don't believe in you
of the idea that you doubtin I'm unbeatable
Vizzini in "The Princess Bride" - inconceivable!
These MC's is eatable - wait, edible
I'm fishin with dynamite, now I got a freezer full
of rappers, bastard I'm ten steps ahead of you
Incredible, give credit where credit due

[Rubix]
Put passion into action
Mashin on the gas where them others they be maxin
Accelerate, generate, power with my pen and pape
Stimulate, you simulate, you do what I incinerate

[Talib Kweli]
We do it for the dinner plates, musical we innovate, you imitate
Your theory full of holes and so it ventilate
Damnit man for goodness sakes, they love when we get on stage
Even if they don't, one quote and the hate disintegrate

[Rubix]
They feel us like shade, you know we feelin great
Not a script that is writ, this is our original spit
An unconventional gift, Kwe' we interpolate
Them others be herbin it, the praise we deservin it

[Talib Kweli]
Word, I love songs (uh-huh) writin to right wrongs (c'mon)
Continue to fight on (yeah) I'm puttin the gloves on (c'mon)
I love horns, I'm lovin this damn track
I'm lovin the hand clap (let's go) clap, clap
... Lovin it when you listen
Love'll fix it said Ashford and Simpson (that's right)
We livin for the drums in the slums, some of the best parts
The tourists never come, they run when it gets dark

[Rubix]
Yeah, so on my outer space, they funny like them bridal maids
Bookin like we playin Spades, yeah we always make the grade
FSC to get a faith, Valencia to the Haight
Sucker-free, I'm in my space, say I'm hella steezy, yea
Believe I get it so in, streakin like it's Martin
Sunny and Delores bike park and
Fly chicks sparkin - then we up the road
to the Phoenix on some steady bar hoppin
It's high life everywhere, Tony Allen rhythm is
Pattern that we livin in, Kweli on his busi-ness
Everywhere we deep in this, shorties gon' be speakin it
"Oh, they so uniquely spit!"

[Talib Kweli]
Yeah, the great debater, the savior, the caped crusader
The alpha, the omega, your favorite communicator
News junkie, I'm debunkin the myth of the job creators
That part of the conversation, the start of indoctrination
The flow is a thing of beauty, I'm bringin it, that's my duty
You drinkin it like a smoothie, they spinnin it like a Sufi
Rappers I dissect 'em, collectin 'em like a souve-
-nir, they actin up, I'm directin 'em like a movie
Skip the drama, this is action adventure
They so freakin soft it should be against the law
Illegal tender - aiyyo Ru', I really need to mention
... This is the high life

[Bajah]
So we're living in the high life, high life
High life, high life
Cause we be living the high life, high life
High life, high life
Yes I'm living the high life, high life
High life, high life
Cause I'm living in the high life, high life...

{*40 seconds of instrumental*}

[Rubix] This the high life
[Talib] Yea, yea!
