Who's in the house, Trucker
Who's in the house, Trucker
Who's in the house, Trucker
Who's in the house, Trucker

Singin' hey now people here we come
Here we come, motherfuckers, here we kitty come come
You know what we do and where we're from, Detroit baby
You got fifteen seconds to get to your seat now, ah yeah, uh
We're gonna start this show and blow your minds now, yeah
Who's in the house, who's your uncle, Uncle Kracker

[Uncle Kracker]
Double Wide on the side, in the back of the bus
I'm your Uncle Kracker, sitting platinum plus
Double platinum, what, triple platinum, fuck
You'd be accountant, motherfucker if you add that up
Can you back that up, yeah, but what for
I've got a big brick house with two gold doors
What's more than that, you need to shut my mouth
I'm the same motherfucker you been hearing about
'Kracker went pop', no, I did the pop dash
Floatin' through the airwaves, pickin' up cash
I dropped Follow Me, people thought I went soft, shit
Chill, I'm still very difficult to fuck with

Straight out of the sticks of Romeo, Michigan
The early mornin' stoned, motherfucking pimp of the God damn nation
Yee-haw, motherfuckers, let's rock
With the Kid, yes y'all ya dig, ya don't stop
Got riffs to rock, brought booze to slam
Now who's the man, Kid Rock, God damn
Back on the scene like a fiend for beats
Ain't slept in weeks, got too many freaks
Seen too many geeks try to rock the rap
So I'm back with heat to unseat the wack
I'm a unpack and set up shop
I'm a step back and watch ya rock
I'm a bomb tracks to stop the pop
Then I'm a master-blast it through the aftershock
I got dug ditches to bury you bitches
Who whoa the flow, who wanna stop the show
So I'm a roll and throw another on point seven
From North of Detroit, way South of Heaven, yeah
Turn it up, uh, come on

Rock motherfucker with the T-B-T
Rollin' through your city like the General Lee
You wanna fuck with me, don't test the odds
Cause your arms are too short to box with God
But if you send me your address, I'll swing by
Call up your friends, I'll get your whole fucking crew high
Say bye, bye, bye to the wack
And let it be known Kid Rock is back

Yeah, rollin' with the T-B-T
We're gonna rock the house for my man Joe C.
Yeah, we're gonna start this show
Come on, come on, yeah</pre>
