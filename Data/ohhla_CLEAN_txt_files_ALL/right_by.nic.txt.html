[Nicki Minaj]
It all comes, down to this
I miss your, morning kiss
I won't lie, I'm feelin it
You don't know, and I'm missin it
I'm so gone, I must admit
It's too much, to hold it in
I can't say, no more than this
I just hope your heart hear me nowwww
I let you know, how I'm feelin
You own my heart, he just rentin
Don't turn away, pay attention
I'm pourin out my heart, oh boy~!

[Chorus 2X: Nicki Minaj - singing]
Iiiii-I, I'm not livin liiiife
I'm not livin riiiight
I'm not livin if you're not by my side
Noo-ohhhh

[Chris Brown]
Let's meet at, our favorite spot
You know the one, right around the block
From a nice place, that you love to shop
Can you get awayyyy?
Care to sit down, let's talk it out
One on one, without a crowd
I wanna hold your hand, makin love again
I need to be near you
Gotta let you know, how I'm feelin
Own my heart, and she just rentin
Don't turn away, pay attention
I'm pourin out my, heart girl~!

[Chorus]

[Nicki Minaj - repeat 2X]
I can't eat, I I I, I
I can't sleep, I I I, I
What I need, I I I, I
Is you right, by, my side, I

[Nicki Minaj]
It-it-it ain't
It-it ain't your spit game, it's your dick game
that got me walkin 'round ready to wear your big chain
I only argue with him, when the Lakers on
Other than that I'm gettin my Marc Jacobs on
My-my pussy game's so cold that he always seem to come back
Cause he know that it be a wrap, when I'm ridin it from the back
Wait, oh let me see your phone, cause all them bitches is ratchet
And now let me get in my truck, cause all them bitches'll catch it
W-w-w-w-w-w-w-wait, damn, there I go again
I'll be trippin, I'll be flippin, I'll be so belligerent
Man this shit that we be fightin over's so irrelevant
I don't even remember though, I was probably hella bent
Let's go

[Chorus]

[Outro: Nicki Minaj]
Iiiii-I (whoahh whoahh whoahh)
Liiiife (whoahh whoahh whoahh)
Riiiight (whoahh whoahh whoahh)
If you're not by my side, no-ohhhh
I can't eat, I I I, I
I can't sleep, I I I, I
What I need, I I I, I
Is you right, by, my side, I</pre>
