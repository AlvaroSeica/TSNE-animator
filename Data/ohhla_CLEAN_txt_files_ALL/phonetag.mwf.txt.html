"Hello, you have eight messages"

[Lonnie B]
Yo Danja, I see you're not at home
It's me Lonnie B tryin to catch you on the phone
I got some bad news I seen your girl at the park
Chillin on the deelow with this dude named Mark
Now I ain't one to gossip and I know how you are
But it was her for real I seen them kissin in her car
I wouldn't bring it to you if I thought it wasn't true
So hit me on my box tell me what you wanna do

[Danja Mowf]
Aiyyo Lonnie, you sure you seen my shorty?
Chillin at the park with a nigga gettin naughty? (Yup)
Let me get the forty... four, I'ma buck her
D'Angelo style, shit damn motherFUCKER! (Calm down brother)
Hold up, wait let me think
First I gotta go take a trip to the bank (uh-huh)
Transfer all the funds, cancel credit cards
As we speak I'm throwin all her clothes in the yard (pssh, man)
Things she can't pronounce, things she can't afford
Things she can't... hold up, I'm tangled in the cord
Here she comes now, you know what time it is
Meet me at the James I'ma throw her off the bridge

[Mike Street]
Aiyyo Danja, I see you're not at home
This is Mike Street tryin to catch you on the phone
I got some bad news, I'm up here at the station
I heard the P.D. won't put you in rotation
Son I tried to save ya, and play you on the Flava
But he kept flippin on some ill type behavior
I told him you were hot but he didn't have a clue
Hit me on the cell and tell me what you wanna do

[Danja Mowf]
Aiyyo Street (Mowwwwf) What da deal?
Brothers tryin to take me off the radio for real? (Yeahhh)
Why they wanna ill?  I just don't understand
But if they wanna play rough, check it here's the plan (a-ight)
Your man gettin off around six (uh-huh)
I'll be in the van at the five o'clock mix (right)
Ski mask and black gloves, ready to attack cuz
And snatch him in the back of, the van for tryin to act up (What?)
Drop Squad style, blindfold him, hold him, scold him
bout the things that you told him
But if he won't cooperate you know what time it is (What?)
6:30, James River, I'm throwin him off the bridge (Bet)

[Shawnee Poo]
Aiyyo Danja, I see you're not at home
But this is Shawnee Poo tryin to catch you on the phone
I got some bad news, I hope you sittin down
Some kids from crosstown tryin to steal your whole sound
And not just that, they bustin on your mens
They say they battle SupaFriendz and only got wins
I know you not gon' let them diss you and your crew
So hit me at the crib and tell me what you wanna do

[Danja Mowf]
Word Shawnee Poo?  They tryin to diss my crew?
And on the downlow tryin to get my sound too?  (Yup)
Especially round you!  "Disorganized" my peeps
Time to let em know, SupaFriendz play for keeps (Gotcha back)
Call Ray, Joe, Wally and Lil Rock
Tell em meet me on the block half past six o'clock
Then I'ma call Lonnie, Shaquan and Speedis Toine
Who, Kalonji, MyndBenda, Javon and Don Cabon (do it)
and tell em that it's on, eh yo I'm gettin hyper
We'll invite them wack kids to come and join the cypher
I'ma play the Pied Piper, you know how he did (what?)
Lead em to the river, and throw em off the bridge
