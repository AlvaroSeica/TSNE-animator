[Intro: Havoc]
Da-da-da..
Right there, yea, spin that back
	*record spins back*
Drop it, drop it, yea, uhhh, straight out the lab
Chemistry made, you know, yo

[Verse One: Havoc]
I don't wanna wild, I just wanna chill
But yet still gettin' confronted by ice grills
They learn when I hit 'em with, heat and conspicuous
Stunt, just a little bit - start, we gon' finish this shit
You little niggaz runnin' round snot nose
I laugh with a cold grin, I dead you wanna pose
You fuckin' wit a nigga, who done been through the bullshit
Niggaz die Mesabi, close friends turn to grimy
Wifey, bonin' associates hate a simple bitch
Add it all together; you know who you fuckin' wit
A nigga who can give a fuck if you broke
Give a fuck what he tote, got the drop then blow
You's a scared nigga tryna live
Yellow back and shit
You's a real good actor, your click actresses
Fact is, niggaz lose stripes for tryna match this
Havoc's a total package; knock a nigga of his axis

[Chorus: Havoc]
Twist your cap +Backwards+, real niggaz handle
Beef, then it's on dunn, lick off if I have to
Niggaz scream gangsta, real niggaz play low
Play in the back, but fuck around and get smacked yo

(And I) Twist your cap +Backwards+, real niggaz handle
Beef, then it's on dunn, lick off if I have to
Niggaz scream gangsta, real niggaz play low
Play in the back, but fuck around and get smacked yo

[Verse Two: Prodigy]
Yo dunn I love it when these niggaz think it's somethin' sweet wit P
Love it when people doubt me
Love it when you niggaz write songs about me, I love confrontation
Love it when a nigga that don't rap, he hatin'
I love it when they think it's only a song I'm fakin'
I love to see they face when my gun bangin'
And I would love for us to bump it to each other on a humble
Your niggaz is stabbin', my niggaz'll buck you
Y'all niggaz is flaggin', yeah we got one too
Infamous, I heard you screamin' our name, whatup with you?
Let me explain somethin', we the world's most
Y'all rap niggaz, we do this shit for real
Look, listen, I knock ya hustle down kid
You's a fall to the next nigga, I murder you bitch
I would love to watch you bleed and take ya last breath
Give you pain, and let you get acquainted with death, boy

[Chorus: Havoc]
Twist your cap +Backwards+, real niggaz handle
Beef, then it's on dunn, lick off if I have to
Niggaz scream gangsta, real niggaz play low
Play in the back, but fuck around and get smacked yo

('Cause I'ma) Twist your cap +Backwards+, real niggaz handle
Beef, then it's on dunn, lick off if I have to
Niggaz scream gangsta, real niggaz play low
Play in the back, but fuck around and get smacked yo

('Cause I'ma) Twist your cap +Backwards+

Niggaz sream gangsta

('Cause I'ma) Twist your cap +Backwards+

Niggaz scream gangsta, real niggaz play low
Play in the back, but fuck around and get smacked yo
('Cause I'ma) Twist your cap +Backwards+</pre>
