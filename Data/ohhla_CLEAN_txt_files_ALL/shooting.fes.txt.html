[Chorus: Fes Taylor]
My life fucked up, So what I could fix the wrongs
Go hard like I spit on this song
Look inside myself, I see what I did in the past
It's like every time I visit the Ave, I find myself
Right back where I started from, Day one
Under the clouds, Waiting for the rain to come
And no one saw, Nothing but a star come down from the sky
And no one saw, Nothing but a star come down from the sky

[Fes Taylor]
The birth of hip hop re-born, Pass the peacock, Preach on
Anything you put me on know I'm a best on
Soon as you throw some beats on and he's gone
Like Fifty did Camron, These niggas is tampons
Losing my patients, Constantly my buttons is pressed
See the kids frontin', Nigga I'm fresh, Try to uplift the people
But some satisfied we're living less then equal
Nigga I tote the desert eagle, Ruffle a nigga's feathers
Nothing's forever, Sooner or later nigga it's just you and the maker
Will he understand, For the love of money and rubber bands
Bitches, Drugs, And contraband, Fly clothes
New kicks I buy those, Size ten I try those
Up in 5-0's for five days with five hoes
Get it all into tariffs, My nigga's our show
Rest in peace rose

[Chorus]

[Inspectah Deck]
These niggas want me boxed underground
But I'm still here standing motherfuckers, What now
You never gonnna take me alive
I'm guaranteed to make a way to survive
I'm on the block with the foils of caine
And if worst come to worst I'll pitch Muslim oil on the train
Like Malcolm with the shotty in the window by all means
Fiends in the lobby, Open longer then Walgreen's
I dreamed it'd be better then this
All my G's got cheddah to split, Years from now reminisce how
The struggle made me, The hustle changed me
And lately I got no friends, These niggas hate me
Cause I'm a rider from the Caddys to bikes
I'm on my own like Daddy and Mike, Yeah Daddy all right
No escaping it, I'm trapped in the life
Were your head come un-attached for the price

[Chorus]

[T-Bird]
I aint even a rapper, I'm a hustler with a flow
So if rap don't work, Then it's back to sling'n dope
And if that don't work, Well I got a mob of niggas that be robbing niggas
I'm like K-Slay, I love the drama niggas
Slugs squeezed from the hammer, When I squeeze from the trigger
I don't even battle no more I just sneeze on niggas
Ice froze on the finger, Reason for me leaving it must be the telling season
I'm like please don't talk, If you do, You'll find out first hand if Jesus walks
I'm so hard body but these streets is soft
And I don't hang with pussy niggas that act like they bad
Cause hanging around all them pussies started making me mad
That's why it's back to my lab and back to my craft
Put the mack to your back and leave your back on a slab
Still get it eighteen a grisly and sixty a slab
Your flow aint adding up you wasn't doing your math
