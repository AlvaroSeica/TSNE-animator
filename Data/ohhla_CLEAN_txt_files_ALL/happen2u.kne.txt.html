-That nigga done fucked with a nigga from the ghetto
-He don't know who he fucking with

This one goes out to the murder capital murder capital of the world

(Chorus)

At night they robbing and they killing and they jacking
And when you slipping g that just when its gone happen
So be best to watch your back and keep your gat close
Before them No Limit Soldiers peel your cap hoe

Verse 1 (Kane)

The heart of a human is evil like a Damien
Every man born crying bucking ready to die screaming
It's the rapping grim reaper that heavenly got you scratching
Gone off that peter oding on some aspirin
Kane &amp; Abel back in that ass like return of the dragon
And on Friday the 13th I'm a play Jason
Pops mad tripping like if I was freebasing
Nightmare on Elm Street I'm gone play Freddy Krueger
Creeping on your block be like masked with the rueger
If I pull a wicked's Child Play I'm gone play Chucky
AK now you coming out some money
Check the dictionary definition of a hustler
Best to chill or be chilled we got more drama than Blockbuster
Clack clack pull it back that's when I rhyme in the chamber
Down with No Limit whipping on haters like some Power Rangers
Ten plus seven in the click, got a death wish
How you gonna get with this
Man I'm cooler than eskimo piss
Catch me in my candy impala getting none
Couldn't live my thug life cause it was tatted cross your stomach
Now I'm feeling good got weight circulating through the hood

(Chorus)

Verse 2 (Abel)

Its on robberies like they balling and they g's
True players for real ask Master P
Creeping up on me, I'm the one that did this to ya, put that ass in 
surgery
Pimping like my name was Pretty Tony, phony busters wanna murder me
Picking 'em up taking 'em up to Howard Johnson's
Kane &amp; Abel get the money like we bail bondsmen
If this is Halloween I'm a play Michael Myers
You could smoke a bag of smoke but I bet that sticky get you higher
For the love of money had to kill you like Radio Raheem
Do the right thing or these 17 put you in a gangsta lean
Or laying in a pine box cause the drama don't stop on my block
That's how it happen to you

(Chorus)</pre>
