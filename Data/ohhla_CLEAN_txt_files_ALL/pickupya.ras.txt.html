[Rasaq]
Ye, uh, uh
It's Rasaq, put ya chips up
I ain't gonna stop, till ya whole body chipped up
Dripped up, princess cuts from the wrist up
Sip buck, me n my click up in the buildin', as quick as a hiccup
Pick up ya pace, or get left behind
The only rapper you know, that could use ya left and right mind
Bought me a whip, and chamillion co signed
And bought the same as mine, in mint n chrome shine
The watch is aquatic blue, I promise you
Niggaz got me laughin', like comic view
Throw game like a sonic boom, and I'm wild
Not 50 cent, but I know you like my style
Know you like my smile, teeth look sharper than a crocadiles
Roc's n pows, shine for blocks n miles
Knock ya pal, in the butt for clarity from the roc's is wild
Even from the top go wild, birds fall at em
Flock when they see the, watch and smile
Not hostile, but the chain got so much agression
Niggaz be plexin, and never learned they lesson
Uh, Rasaq on the block ye ye
Uh, uh, it's-
Uh, Rasaq on the block ye ye
Uh, uh, it's-
Uh, Rasaq on the block ye ye
Uh, uh, it's Rasaq put ya chips up
I ain't gonna stop, till ya whole body chipped up
Dripped up, princess cuts from the wrist up
Sip buck, me n my click up in the buildin', as quick as a hiccup
Pick up ya pace, or get left behind
The only rapper you know, that could use ya left and right mind
Bought me a whip, and chamillion co signed
And bought the same as mine, in mint n chrome shine
The watch is aquatic blue, I promise you
Niggaz got me laughin', like comic view
Throw game like a sonic boom, and I'm wild
Not 50 cent, but I know you like my style
Know you like my smile, teeth look sharper than a crocadiles
Roc's n pows, shine for blocks n miles
Knock ya pal, in the butt for clarity from the roc's is wild
Even from the top go wild, birds fall at em
Flock when they see the, watch and smile
Not hostile, but the chain got so much agression
Niggaz be plexin, and never learned they lesson
Sorry nigga, tryna make this chedda
Call me paper clip, cuz I hold this paper together
Like papers n letters, catch me in the hepper stapled together
Like, bin dancin' wit our neigbours together
Nigga, gyea
