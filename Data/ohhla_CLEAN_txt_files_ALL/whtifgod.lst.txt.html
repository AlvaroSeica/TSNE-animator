[Intro: Morpheus (Neo) "The Matrix" sample]
What is the Matrix? Control
The Matrix is a computer-generated dream world
Built to keep us under control in order to change a human being into this...
(No, I don't believe it, it's not possible)
I didn't say it would be easy, Neo
I just said it would be the truth

[G-Clef Da Mad Komposa]
Sent to shut down... sent to shut down...
Sent to shut down ya discordant passion
In your temple I'm Jesus, breaking, smashing
Tahuti in God's house, once again
With the Templar Sword, pointed at your chin
Soul Kid Klik was all Masons
The only true chocolate pecan and vanilla interfacing
On a path to perfection, but we didn't see
The industry was lurkin' at the intersection
I don't trust Mel Gibson, just like I don't support bullshit, I hit
him with a bullwhip
Make his ass feel the passion, cuz stealin' souls is a fatal infraction
Hmm, I see you got alot of evil people here
On the forgotten planet, enough, I've had it
Joe Aton, bout to break ya world
Look at ya life nigga, what if God was a girl?

[Hook: Jakineko]
Maybe your mind can't take it...
Maybe I'll have to break it in...
Once you realize you have no choice
You must submit...

[Chorus 2X: Archangel Metatron (G-Clef Da Mad Komposa)]
Here comes the angel of death, time to resurrect
We represent, the other side of mirrors, you fear us
(But can't hear us, deaf, dumb &amp; blind
Trapped in the matrix of your mind)

[Archangel Metatron]
Yo, we locked, in this three dimensional box
My body heat provides the energy for selfish plots
Melted clocks, backdrop my landscape
New York in the vain, mastered this concrete maze
But yo, I'm spinning in the square's circle
I don't care... I'll murk you
Fuck your version of sin and virtue
You wrong nigga, word is bond, nigga
Lost Secret start a war, nigga
Dethrone your Pope, reap and sow my hope
We not the ones that you want to provoke
Now... we buck at your Soul, your Spirit, your Essence
You like a tree that fell in nobody's presence
Non-existent, we spit new scriptures
That start religions in another solar system
All praises due... Archangel Metatron
Don't give a fuck about persuading you

[Chorus 2X]

[G-Clef Da Mad Komposa]
We make you know you got no control
From the flesh to the mind to the spirit to the soul
Many wan test but many gon' die
Melchizedek protect ya neck, don't ask why
Too many questions for now you just listen
My mercury flows so fast you keep missin'
A moving target at a speed that's outta sight
Cuz when I spark the mic, you see light
Mythical missionary, I'm seen on ya planet
A friendly stranger, apocalypse avenger
Revealer of languages, reliever of anguishes
For five thosuand years been wrapped up in bandages
But I'm back, to attack the wack
Spooky like a seance, crack you up like crayons
Wack emcees are the devil, peace to all my true brothers
And I'll see you on the level

[Archangel Metatron]
I read the Torah, read the Koran
Now I live life for Gomar Oz Dubar
No time for praying and hoping
I walk the streets wit no emotion
I'm focused, on my inner visions and dreams
Got beef wit us, I'm up in heaven, but we still in Queens
For real, we mean... strike wit lightning
Ghost get frightened by this pen that I write with
We original don't need to mimic y'all
Bullshit I slice.. wit a Shriner's scimitar
It's getting serious in the world today
"It's all good", "holla back", that's just what y'all say
But your truth contradicts the fact
You may get airplay, but that shit is wack
Who do you believe and who do you trust?
Presenting Lost Secret, and yea we know what's up

[Hook]
