[Verse 1: Hopsin]
Man, Fuck!
Me and my girl keep arguin'
Somehow my life just got hard again
She's scared of groupies that steady bargin' in
I can't explain the pain my heart is in
Yeah I got money, but reality isn't sunny, it's dark and grim
See when I'm tour I don't take her
So she can feel what anger, thinkin' that another woman is gon' replace her
She standing in tears of emotion knee deep
I keep tryna tell her "Why? I ain't fuckin' no groupie!"
She don't believe me
My career is so deceiving
She's dating a rapper, nobody said it was gon' be easy
She threaten' to leave me cause of these text messages girls sent
Now I'm just caught in this whirlwind
Tryna explain they just friends who can't control themselves
They see the fame, think I'm cute, and they get overwhelmed
She should fuckin' know the deal
I'm done dealing with this bull shit
Bitch, I'm outta here, you can go to hell!

[Chorus]
There's no room to dive at the end of the road
When you're living in the cold not wearing a coat
The breeze turns tears to snow

[Verse 2: Hopsin]
The underground ain't been the same since I emerged from it
Niggas hear my name and they just hatin' throw some dirt on it
Talking bout I blew up and just left them in the dust
But, we ain't friends mothafucka we ain't neva kicked it once
You better zip it shut, I'm respectful
But, if I spot you that's the only time that I won't ever give a fuck!
Your words can make a difference, do not forget
If you run your mouth and talk shit, you payin' for what comes out of it
Bitch niggas acting all macho jealous cuz they ain't got dough
While they still won't put enough for me at my show
Smiling coming over to me like I'm the coldest MC
And then you bad mouth the moment I leave!
Aight, I got it since I'm in the limelight
You niggas try to look cool by not being hyped about my height
Simple and plain, better watch where your missiles are aimed
Insult my name you'll rekindle a flame, nigga</pre>
