[Tech N9ne]
Let's go, yeah, I feel this one man
and this one was long overdue
It's bout my mama nem
My mama, her sisters, her brothers, grandma too man
I just wanna take this time to speak about mama nem
Yeah, check it

She carried me when she was fifteen
Had me when she was sixteen
Reminiscing on how well she did things
Got one popped on 11-8-71, she had this king
She was baring, then on that day
I was just a staring upon that face
With her just declaring, my mum said wait
Then her and her sisters named me Aaron Dontez Yates
She, tried to give me everything I seen
KCP&amp;L gas service was her means for green
Took me to the movies when they bought Halloween to screen
Got me a big wheel, couldn't afford a green machine
But I loved it, when I got it all my friends swarming
cause in the projects, big wheels wasn't the norm and
I'm pouring this out to the woman I'm adoring
She know I like sugar snacks and a fried baloney sandwich in the morning

[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]
Mama, I take you everywhere I go
I thank you're mine (that's my mama)
I only know what I know cause of my mama
You gave me life and you made me me
I don't know who I'd be without
auntie nem, my sisters and, my uncle nem
Mama nem

[Tech N9ne]
When I got bad grades, I was in the heat seat
Got a whooping when I used another kid's cheat-sheet
But when I got a good grade card she bought me Beat Street
The single, aiyyo I had that mug on repeat
Mama nem taught me rhythm that I use, yep
My uncle nem say stay on your Ps and Qs neph'
Mama talking catches you if you acting like you deaf
God-fearing, still taught me how to two-step
Took me to church Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday
Saturday, then Sunday, thinking why me?
That was mama nem placing the love inside me, our house was lively
My granny house, eight girls and four boys beside me
Thanking mama nem for the weight that you carried
Pulling my teeth with threads saying "boy, you scary"
I 'member mama laughing, saying "is it loose?", very
Pull it then, push cash under my pillow saying it's the tooth fairy

[Chorus]

[Tech N9ne]
Epilepsy at eighteen, then lupus hit her
Pancreatitis was taking her, but God was with her
I asked him show me something cause I was all bitter
Right after that the pancreatitis had all withered
Mama "yeah?", mama "what?"
Mama "what, boy?", I'm a big timer
And I'm always away from you cause of this music biz drama
But I really miss you and I'm always thinking bout big, mama
She used to make that Thanksgiving and Christmas dinner
Grandma's home cooking easily show up Mrs. Winter's
Mama nem would take you in even if you were vicious sinner
Nobody will ever take that humungous love kept within her
If your mama gone, Heaven's where mom belong
or if your mama home, call ya mama phone
and say I love you mama and you are not alone
I just wanted to thank you and that's why I made this mama song

[Chorus]

[Tech N9ne] + (Krizz Kaliko)
It's bout my mama nem man, I love 'em
I wouldn't be nothing without 'em mayne
They make me who I am, everyday man
Tech N9ne, mama nem, I love you
(It's my mama)</pre>
