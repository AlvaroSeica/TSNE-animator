[Intro: Travie McCoy]
Ha ha! Yeah
Travie, bring that hook in

[Chorus: Cee-Lo Green]
Doctor~! (Doctor!!)
Won't you come and help me take this pain away? (Away, away?)
Oh doctor!! (Doctor!!)
Give me what I need to get me through the day (the day, the day)
I want that feel good {that feel good} that feel good {that feel good}
That real good {that real good} yeahhhh
I want that feel good {that feel good} that feel good {that feel good}
That real good {that real good} yeahhhh
Dr. Feel Good help me!

[Travie McCoy]
Lately I been beside myself
And it's unlike me, to hide myself
It's not like I like being by myself
I wanna see the world but can't decide my-self
Whether or not to get up off this couch
Whether or not to get about this house
I wanna know what it's like to feel real good
Is there somethin you can prescribe Dr. Feel Good?
I mean he's so happy, she's so free
Doctor, what in the world is wrong with me?
I just need some reassurance
I know my carrier wont be insurin this
If you could just be earnest
Oops, I meant honest and make this promise
If any of this makes sense
Let 'em know I wasn't crazy, just thoroughly convinced - go!

[Chorus]

[Travie McCoy]
She got the set of lips like a sedative
Every time I kiss, it's like medicine
Somethin said to me "No, no, don't let her in"
cause every time I do, I end up upset again
And then it's back to the waitin room
Waitin patiently for them to bring another patient to 'em
Anything is possible
Especially when you see it in the hospital
I hope Dr. Feel Good can fix me
And help me find peace of mind before 50 (Mr. McCoy, you're up next)
I made a detour quickly
Hightailed it towards the exit door before they could get me
It didn't take much to lose 'em
but before I got home, I came to a conclusion
that feeling good means another appointment
Take two of these and don't expect a call in the mornin - go!

[Chorus]

[Interlude]
Ladies and Gentlemen
Pardon me, patients
See what I'ma do right now is break it down
Put your hands together - tepeat after me, come on
I feel good (I feel good)
Real good (real good)
I feel good (I feel good)
Real good (real good)

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Yeah
I'll let this one ride out
Yeah, brought to you by
yours truly, Mr. Cee-Lo Green, the delectable Smeezingtons
Thank y'all for comin out
God bless
Good night
Travie, by the way</pre>
