[Intro]
There's so much death, there's so much destruction 
There's so much mayhem and there's so much misunderstanding in music
We're losing so many great musicians, and......
We don't love 'em while their here, and I wanna be loved while I'm here
And the only way to get love is to give love

[Chorus] 
You can't run away run away, you gotta face this
You can't run away run away, you gotta face this
Time is moving fast, can't dwell on the past
Make this moment last, while we have the chance
Old dreams will fade, for the new ones made
Nothing stays the same, do it the rebel way

[Verse One]
From moonlight to sunrise, day in and day out I stay on, my
Motors apprehender, opening my third eye, focus on the words I say
Man stand up diligent, militant, with the sentiment, I'm here to represent
Constant changes, like passing rains it's, evident, the time we spent is sacred

[Chorus] 
You can't run away run away, you gotta face this
You can't run away run away, you gotta face this
Time is moving fast, can't dwell on the past
Make this moment last, while we have the chance
Old dreams will fade, for the new ones made
Nothing stays the same, do it the rebel way

[Verse Two]
We still drop it hardcore
Nuff a dem can't take it when the lion roar
We no take no shorts tell 'em we want more
No it's time to settle the score
Hey! For all of my peoples in the ghetto streets reppin
And all who feel they been stepped on
Love is the cure and courage is the weapon, you can use to overcome

[Chorus]
You can't run away run away, you gotta face this
You can't run away run away, you gotta face this
Time is moving fast, can't dwell on the past
Make this moment last, while we have the chance
Old dreams will fade, for the new ones made
Nothing stays the same, do it the rebel way

[Outro]
Do it the rebel way,  do it the rebel way, do it the rebel way, do it the rebel way
Do it the rebel way,  do it the rebel way, do it the rebel way, do it the rebel way
Do it the rebel way,  do it the rebel way, do it the rebel way, do it the rebel way
Do it the rebel way.........
