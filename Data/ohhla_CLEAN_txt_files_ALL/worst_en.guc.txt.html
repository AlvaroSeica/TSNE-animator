[Drumma Boy]
Listen to the track BITCH~!

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
I'm my best friend, and I'm my worst enemy
And no one else can hurt me 'less I let them is you feelin me?
And misery loves company and I had my share of misery
No mystery my infamy got me in hip-hop history
First Tupac died then Biggie died and that greatly impacted me
Then history repeated itself through me and I made history
So I don't turn around no mo' I look at what's in front of me
I'm focused on the future, cause yesterday is history

[Gucci Mane]
A hard head makes a soft ass, guess yo' ma didn't teach you that
Pick a spot to beef with me and that spot I will meet you at
But let me check my schedule, I'm free Tuesday three weeks from now
You brang your crew I'll bring my crew, just pick a time and side of town
Zone 6 is my stompin ground but I guess you know that by now
But everywhere you go you hear me; that's why your upset right now?
Bought a Phantom and a Lamb', but I'm in my 'Vette right now
I raped the game without a rubber bank accounts are pregnant now
The day they tried to murder me, a day I can't forget about
And I don't wish no death on homey just want him to hear me out
Think about the past and all the many things we talked about
Think of all the people influenced by what comes out our mouth

[Chorus]

[Gucci Mane]
I am not the perfect person, me don't spit the perfect verses
I wouldn't hurt a girl on purpose cause I feel they don't deserve it
I admit my words can hurt, I dissed Tiny she didn't deserve it
Our song got heard, didn't interpret it right, and I'm sorry for it
T.I. many times encouraged, told me face the game with courage
Clay me some great advice and still today I'm thankful for it
Me Jeezy and T.I. share one thing in common all are poets
Role models to young people though at times man we still ignore it
And y'all gon' owe respect to me and I don't like apologies
Just diss me 'til you satisfied, I swear it doesn't bother me
Sticks and stones will break my bones and bullets won't reflect off me
But words and insults only show the world how y'all respectin me

[Chorus]

[Gucci Mane]
All my homies ain't my homies, hell my friends no longer want me
I'm still hungry as I was when I did my first live performance
Things I got I know they want it, things I done they haven't done it
Though they say that they my friends I know that these niggaz opponent
We can joke and laugh and party but I know their smiles are phony
But I still pray that the Lord, give 'em all the things they wanted
All the money in the world can't get the joy I'm feelin homey
Like the third date with a woman, like you and not for your money
You can help someone and love someone but still they'll turn and burn you
So I warned you in advance, watch out cause so called friends will con you
Bankhead Jakey said it best, when will I ever know
whose my friends through thick and thin
cause so called friends will turn to foes

[Chorus]</pre>
