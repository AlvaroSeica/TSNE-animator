[Kanye West]
Yeah, yeeeaaahhh
I know, in my shit too, huh

[Chorus]
And I can see it with my eyes closed, now
Feeling like my life froze, I'm about to hit the ground

[Kanye West]
I sold my soul to the Devil, that's a crappy deal
Least it came with a few toys like a Happy Meal
This game you could never win
cause they love you, then they hate you, then they love you again
Get away from me misery, get away from me loneliness
Get away from me fake bitches, I can't take the phoniness
Get away from me wack tracks, I can only make only hits
I'm an only child lost in the world, where do the lonely kids
go when the bell rings? It's feeling like Hell rings
It's bringing me back down, they checking my background
It's ironic what's happening, imagine if I didn't have the ends
I wouldn't have so many imaginary friends
I'm spaced-out dog, I be on that moon talk
Wonder if God asked Mike how to moonwalk?
I swear to momma, wish me and my father talked more
I stopped visiting around the time I was sophomore
I guess everything I hate about me, I see in him
And we ain't finna change, so we won't agree again
Till then I'll be pouring out my soul
Just a few things I see with my eyes closed

[Chorus]

[Kanye West]
I sold my soul to the Devil, that's a crappy deal
Least it came with some toys like a Happy Meal
I'm spaced-out dog, I be on that moon talk
Wonder if God asked Mike how to moonwalk?
You know the entertainment angels
Adriana for Giselle, let's exchange Angels
Photo shoot at my crib, let's exchange angles
Rocking nothing but them Tom Binns bangles
My heart's so anxious, getting anxiety
Begging one of these fucking fashion houses to hire me
They said I've been an asshole, I said if you acquire me
I can be a quiet me, call it verbal dieting
Give me a herbal chai tea, I'll be as calm as Tai Chi
With a bad white bitch like Ice-T
I'm not right dog, I'm slightly off
I'm paranoid like boning raw dog and waking up with a slight cough
Yeah, that will make your dick quite soft
Plus my neck hurt too, let me take all this ice off
Never meant to hurt you, I should have had nights off
But it cost too much to live and I never took the price off

[Chorus]

[Kanye West] + (John Legend) *4X*
Ho-ohhhhh!
Ho-ohhhhh!
Ohhhh (I see it with my eyes closed)</pre>
