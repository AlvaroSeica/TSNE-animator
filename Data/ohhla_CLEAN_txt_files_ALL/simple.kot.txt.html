Simple and free
We got to find us a better way
You cant make no fool out of me
So simple and free
I hear people talking but the words I don't know (words I don't know)
I see people walking and I wonder where they go (wonder where they go)
I see people seating signs up in the streets (signs up on the streets)
Say they hungry need something else to get back on their feet (get back their feet)
I see people crying trying to make a change (trying tomake a change)
And theirs people fighting to make this a safer place (makin it a safer place)
The one we live in is crazier everyday (crazier everyday)
Sometimes I want to get out sometimes I want to escape

We got to find us a better way
You cant make no fool out of me
So simple and free
I never wanted to be like them
I only wanted to be like me
So simple and free
I like to keep it on nice in easy
Keep it on the calm were windy trees speck
Have you ever found a itch in your life with clouds all around
So simple and free
I hold a place in my mind where I can get away from time liven simple designs
So simple and free yeah whoa

I like to wake up slow and easy (yes I do)
I really like to take my time (take my time)
I love the sun to shine on my face
You know it gaves me peace of mind (gaves me peace of mind)
I don't worry about my problems no (no no no)
I wish they could just all go away (all blow away yea)
I don't stress about tomorrow no (no no no)
I just want to live for today
So simple and free

We got to find us a better way
You cant make no fool out of me
So simple and free
I never wanted to be like them
I only wanted to be like me
So simple and free
I like to keep it on nice in easy
Keep it on the calm were windy trees speck
Have you ever found a itch in your life with clouds all around
So simple and free

So simple, feeling so free
No stress and I'm living for the now, believe
I'm in a better faze, better zone
Better aim up on the cross, rose to the turth be known
Yeah he said crime that wanted to find a spot in my life
Were my colors can stand and glow find my right
I gotta feelin you agree father long you see
That the freedom awaits and any path you take
Come on

We got to find us a better way
You cant make no fool out of me
So simple and free
I never wanted to be like them
I only wanted to be like me
So simple and free
I like to keep it on nice in easy
Keep it on the calm were windy trees speck
Have you ever found a itch in your life with clouds all around
So simple and free
I hold a place in my mind where I can get away from time liven simple designs
So simple and free
yeah whoa</pre>
