I go to war
I keep it raw
I go hard
I go to war
I spar
I keep it raw
I go hard

[Canibus]
I make your weak crew release stool
I put a pistol in your mouth and pull
Then I feed you to the pitbulls
Don't even talk about guns
Cuz the only 9 you got is a 5 dollar bill and 4 ones
So I don't really care what y'all hype-o-holics say
Because anything that can't penetrate ricochets
Rhyming with me on the record?
You might as well had died and went to hell instead of heaven
Cuz my rhyme weapon is like a medieval torture method
Your four limbs tied to four horses all pulling in different directions
In this profession I get busy without a question
Seeing me is like seeing a vampires reflection
Fast or slow flows connect like electrodes
I make cassette tape decks blow when I'm in wreck-mode
Explode leavin areas abandoned
with more radiation behind than spots UFO's landed in

[Canibus]
I go to war.... with the best of them
I spar....... with the best of them
I keep it raw.... with the best of them
I go hard.... with the best of them
I go to war.... with the best of them
I spar....... with the best of them
I keep it raw.... with the best of them
I go hard.... with the best of them
I go to war.... with the best of them
I spar.... with the best of them
I keep it raw.... with the best of them
I go hard.... with the best of them
I go to war.... with the best of them
I spar....... with the best of them
I keep it raw.... with the best of them
I go hard

Can I bust, I bust off before the coin toss
Then I rip your loin cloth off
Look how small your genitals are
You got a Napolean complex
Barber shop gossip
Says you used to grab ya ankels in jail for all the convicts
Lap dancing quadraceps
As fruity as a pina colada
On a tropical island in the Bahamas
Trying to win a bikini contest
Them skeletons in ya closet got flesh on them and they smell rotten
Trying to battle is like standing on a launch pad
In Cape Canaveral with me in the astronaut capsule
Ready to blast you on a journey to space
Ready to turn your whole face into sirloin steak
Comparable to questions the bible
How is it possible that the model ship
Fit on incircumscriptible
A congo in this concrete jungle
Pull out your tonsils
And stomp you into the earth like fossils 

[Canibus]
I go to war.... with the best of them
I spar....... with the best of them
I keep it raw.... with the best of them
I go hard.... with the best of them
I go to war.... with the best of them
I spar....... with the best of them
I keep it raw.... with the best of them
I go hard.... with the best of them
I go to war.... with the best of them
I spar.... with the best of them
I keep it raw.... with the best of them
I go hard.... with the best of them
I go to war.... with the best of them
I spar....... with the best of them
I keep it raw.... with the best of them
I go hard

I'm the meanest master of the ceremony on this whole team
And I can kill anything if it bleeds or breathes
Callin all frontline infantry forces on a mission
I got a Howitzer bigger than any Four-Fifth is
Rapping is a raw business
But as an individual I'm as different as anybody's finger print is
If boring is the norm I'm the antonym
Put me in the category you would put Marilyn Manson in
Buggin like a satanic evangelist
Jogging butt naked down Susnet Blvd in Los Angeles
Every MC in your crew would get ruined or wounded
You talk the bullshit and be too scared to do shit
I'm the type of cat that would prove it
Produce shit
Spent so much time in the studio i had to move in
A soldier who practices West Indian obia
I can drink the poison from a king cobra
Cause long after y'all are dead and gone
I survive the nuclear holocaust like a roach arthropod

Is it all soldier
Sir, yes sir!
Is there anything you need
Sir, no sir!
Report back to me before the briefing, at ease!</pre>
