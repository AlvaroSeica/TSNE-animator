*talks*

First mom and dad didn't want me to come here, they wanted me to be just
like them...respectable, hard working, a little house, a family
They drove me crazy with their god damn war grandma, you know mom..
I guess i've always been sheltered and special, I just wanted to be
anonymous, like everybody else, do my share for my country, live up for what
my dad did in first war, and dad did in second, well ... here I am ..
anonymous all right, with guys, nobody really cares about me, they come from
the end of the line most of them, small towns you never heard of, most of
them got nothing, they're poor, they're the unwanted, got the fighting first
for society and their freedom, it's weird isn't it? They're the best I've
ever seen grandma, the heart and soul..

Starts singing
Yo, it's like that
Comes equipped for warfare, beware...no doubt, no doubt, no doubt
Comes equipped for warfare, beware...mr. one man army
Comes equipped for warfare, beware...I'm still a soldier you're trying to
see me boy
You're still a soldier of it...soldier of it
You're still a soldier of it...soldier of it
You're still a soldier...soldier of it
You're still a soldier of it...soldier of it

It's the one man army, general subliminal
Fly through the sky, ready for war with syllables
Binarary military, top secret mission
You aint seen nothin' yet, it's like a stealth jet
My mental plane take flight, I air strike the mic
The mystery pilot in the cockpit all night
See how i keep the shows live, i never lost a dog fight
See how my enemies know style
The name of my plane is the pit bull terrier
Keep my targets locked in, the more the merrier
Over your head when I break the sound barrier
So fly my voice need an aircraft carrier
Travel airwaves, every track is a runway
Keep the jams packed like church on Easter Sunday
Rappers thinking they shall overcome one day
They must be dreaming and I'm lyrical James Earl Ray

It's the one man army
You're still a soldier of it
You aint seen nothing yet, *specialised in warfare of all kind*
You could put your whole army, against my team and..
You're still a soldier of it...soldier of it *you aint seen nothing yet*
You're still a soldier of it...soldier of it
You're still a soldier...soldier of it
You're still a soldier of it...soldier of it

It's the one man army, general subliminal
March across land, ready for war with syllables
Binarary military, top secret mission
You aint seen nothin' yet, I roll up on your set

With speed, movin' like a German blitz krieg
MC's relax is comin to get these rhymes
I've got what they missin', in action
stand at attention, military fashion
and listen to the rapper Rambo, the mic commando
fully equipped, i write rhymes with extra ammo
too much to handle, you had the nerve to try and grab the mic
that's like trying to fight the hacker
I'm too marvelous, when I'm droppin' this watch the mic
turn in to a nuclear test site
MC's better heed the word container (why?)
cause we don't need another hero steamer, check it out!

It's the one man army
You're still a soldier of it
You aint seen nothing yet, *specialised in warfare of all kind*
You could put your whole army, against my team and..
You're still a soldier of it...soldier of it
You're still a soldier of it...soldier of it
You're still a soldier...soldier of it
You're still a soldier of it...soldier of it
It goes like this..

It's the one man army, general subliminal
dive in to the water, ready for war with syllables
binarary military, top secret mission
you aint seen nothin' yet, how deep can i get

Six thousand leagues beneath MC level
a submarine negro with torpedo steel-o's
my strategies turn MCs into P.O. ----- W.'s
I love to battle with other rappers and sink they battle ships
I send them up the creek in they life boats paddelists
salt water navy seals strategists, dive in to your brain waves
the backstroke fabulous, no need to rest if it's shark infested
sonar equipment is a stupid investment
you can't see my style, and I've shown this too many times
I've been in more missions than a homeless
always on point like a compass
three hundred and sixty degrees
All the rhyme MC, it's the one man army

Specialised in warfare of all kind
Specialised in warfare of all kind

It's the one man army, general subliminal
fly through the sky, ready for war with syllables
one man army, general subliminal
march across land, ready for war with syllables
one man army, general subliminal
dive in to the water, ready for war with syllables
binarary military, top secret mission
you aint seen nothin' yet, I roll up on your set
With speed, movin' like a german blitz krieg
One Man Army in the place to be
Whether flyin' through the sky, in the land or sea
yo it's the one man army on a mission
it's the one man army on a mission
it's the one man army on a mission
Specialize in warfare's of all kind, yeah, yeah, yeah
one man army, general subliminal
one man army, general subliminal
one man army, general subliminal
