Typed by: AZ Lyrics

This one is for my people all the very people
This one is for my people
We got trees growin out the dirt for us to climb on
beats attackin your ears for us to ryme on
Our time with a bag of purp
3 5 dimes puttin shags to work
We on both sides of the river all around the ocea
 spinnin like a carousel stuck in fast motion
Like that champ out on his back flat
on the map I been doin that
We runnin bare foot on broken glass I can't believe it
but the shit is out there and were here to receive it
Catch me on the waterfalls with sexy ass mermaids washin my balls
Were throwin rocks in the sky puttin craters on the moon
chillin with the creature from the black lagoon
Communication through your stereo
for everybody listenin here we go

This ones for my people
The people
The very people
Listenin here
And it dont matter where (Out there)
This ones for my people
The people
The very people
Listenin here
And it dont matter where (Out there)

We flyin with the red wall needles gettin shot at
floatin on a iceberg wonderin were the pot at
Grease paint with a bottle of go
fetch me a lette and I'm outta the do'
We take you higher then lex luger always stay true
to scrubs universally on wanted juggalletes and thugs
I got a robotic arm and dont nobody know it
I can rip your whole head and throw it
We are a never ending story that only gets better
as we make our way through this life we live together
Hooptie ridin with my headphones on vision
I'm in a bentley on hologram chrome
The wicked shit will never die put some hatchet in your earholes
real underground baby punchin through your stereos
Somthin wicked for the chosin few
so for everybody listenin this goes to you

This ones for my people
The people
The very people
Listenin here
And it dont matter where (Out there)
This ones for my people
The people
The very people
Listenin here
And it dont matter where (Out there)

For my people livin downtown (it dont matter where)
For my people livin in the forrest (out there)
For my people livin in the dry desert and where the rain pours(out there)
For my people in the jungle for my people in the beatbox (out there)
For my people in the island for my people in the crops (out there)
For my people in the snowstroms for my people in the heatwaves (out there)
For my people bein born and all my people in the graves (out there)
For my people in the swamp lands for my people of the tundra (out there)
For my people in the penthouses and the others livin under (out there)
For my people in oriente for my people of the seas (out there)
For my people in the out back and my people from the trees (out there)
For my people of the mountains for my people on the road (out there)
For my people everywhere that call themselves juggalos (out there)</pre>
