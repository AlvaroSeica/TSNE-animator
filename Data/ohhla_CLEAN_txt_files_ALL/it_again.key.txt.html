[Kendrick Lamar]
And everybody know the story of David and Goliath but this is bigger than triumph
This is for the warrior, this is for you and I
This is for euphoria, give me a piece of mind
God is recordin' this, won't you look in the sky?
Tell him you got the behavior of your neighbor
Even when stability's never in your favor
Fly with the turbulence, only last a minute
Land on your dreams, and recognize you live it
Walk through the valley of peace, with bare FEET (whoa)
Run through the flames, that's more passion for ME (whoa)
I passed that, this morning just so the world can SEE (whoa)
Got them wolves on me, no watch me lick 'em clean
I know, I know, my pride, my goals, my highs, my lows
I know, I know, it's mind control
I know I could prosper, no impostor, prosecute my posture
I stand up and I stand by her, what

[Alicia Keys]
I am a freedom fighter, the name that history wrote
And even through disaster, eye of the tiger for hope
I'm tryin' to find my way back, there's no day off for heroes
And even when I'm tired, go is the only word I know

[Interlude: Alicia Keys]
And the night is takin' over, and the moonlight gets exposure
And the players have been chosen, and it seems like fate has spoken
When it seems your faith has broken, by the second, losin' focus
Ain't no way to get off, get off, get off, get off - unless you move forward

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
I bet they wonder hoooooow, I go on, go on
I bet they wonder hoooooow, I go on, go on
I'll simply say "it's on again, it's on again" - whoa-ohhh
The world don't stop, it's on again, it's on again - whoa-ohhh

[Alicia Keys]
I am a lonely hero, tryin' to fight my battles
Life likes to blow the cold wind, sometimes it freezes my shadow
In the midst of all this darkness, I sacrifice my ego
There ain't no room for selfish, we do it for the people

[Interlude] + [Chorus]

[Alicia Keys]
Say the work don't stop, cause they don't stop
And everybody here tryna get on top
Everybody from the 'burbs down to the block
Gotta hold on tight and don't let go, let go
Huh, so you think you hot?
Gotta grind hard, give it all you got
You can have, or you can have not
You see that a lot in the ghetto, ghetto

[Chorus] - minus first four words</pre>
