Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I made the Cadillac swirl, left hand gripping the wool
The right hand up in a skirt
My passenger's wine fine, I got five dolls all across the world
I'm connected like the Wi-Fi
YXY, I do what I do, but your girl got the asses, 'cause I'm screwing her too
You say young money party, bring you and your crew
Smoke some, drink some, yeah, we do what we do

Star foam fill with the DJ stool
That's the purple for your uncle said don't be late too
Getting fucked up, grabbing the ice, filling the cup
Sipping to your ice, get low, getting snugged up, jumped up
Mirror rolled another dutch up, the ladies try to smoke 'cause they're already fucked up
Man, I can't lie, that's a hell of a life
Pocket full of money, this gonna be a hell of a night

Get smoked and drunk and count the money
We just smoked and drank and count the money
In a clean tuxedo with the top chap off, we the real nigga shit, we're not like y'all
Smoke and drank and count the money
We just smoked and drank and count the money
In a clean tuxedo with the top chap off, got a bad bitch with me and I'm getting topped off

I'm smoking and I'm holding my airs in
My sixtynine, ain't got no cup orders
Yeah, I said the 69, original motor falling, that's really mine
Paid cash for it, not really grind
Niggas measuring pounds instead of time
Cake instead of the day
Know it's a quarter mil', I can tell by how much it weight
Everything good, I guess my nigga's straight
Skinny nigga but my bank is full
Try to wait a little bit to cut this 9-11, but I'm getting anxious, fool
30 thousand feet up, smoking like it's legal
Getting served breakfast on a trip to Dubai, flying private
But I am a lot about my people
Who know the car fast, I slow my speed up
Made a million of keeping it G and roll the weed up
Now people fly all across the stations to meet us
Haters saying they won't defeat us
They don't hate us, they wanna be us
Truth is you can join us and be us

We just smoked and drunk and count the money
We just smoked and drank and count the money
In a clean tuxedo with the top chap off, we the real nigga shit, we're not like y'all
Smoke and drank and count the money
We just smoked and drank and count the money
In a clean tuxedo with the top chap off, got a bad bitch with me and I'm getting topped off

Okay, I'm riding around the city, it's something that is so pretty
Passenger looking gorgeous, sing, yeah, she as hot as Diddy
Diamonds are looking flawless, yes, I pay me a pretty
You need to keep the eyes on the necklace dancing like Diddy
New Orleans, I put up for my city
Where the niggas and bitches only sit in my committee
Lames can't get at me, so they feel me a green light
And while they at the red light, nigga I grim 'em
Barbecue 'em like get me
Young money, I ride with it, is losing, I'd be winning
Riding my Coop, ignite, back it, I'm winner
I'm a grimo, that outer more of my wish, that's the difference, time zone
Our future, I speak with the shit, I guess my grind on
And these lame rappers faker than the rhymestone
Young boss, I'm a show you the shit I'm on
Pulling my pants, my girl crying on
Why I am TGOD, it's time to shine on

Get smoked and drunk and count the money
We just smoked and drank and count the money
In a clean tuxedo with the top chap off, we the real nigga shit, we're not like y'all
Smoke and drank and count the money
We just smoked and drank and count the money
In a clean tuxedo with the top chap off, got a bad bitch with me and I'm getting topped off</pre>
