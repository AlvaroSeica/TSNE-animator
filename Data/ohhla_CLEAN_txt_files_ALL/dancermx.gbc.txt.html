"I'll be"
"I'll be"
"I'll be, I'll be, I'll be"
"Dancing on your grave"
"Dancing on your grave"
"Dancing on your grave, dance-dancing on your grave"
"I'll be" --&gt; Apathy
"Get, busy"
"Get, busy"
"Dancing on your grave"
"Dancing on your grave, dance-dance-dance"

Chorus: Brevi
These, streets are watchin'
Got my eye on you, oooh
What you do

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 1)
[Apathy {Apathy *slowed down*}]
I'm like Sam from Cheers, chillin' at your funeral
{Dancing on your grave} (Get it)
So beautiful {*kiss*}
Kiss my ass, motherfucker, I'm a heathin'
I'm the reason why your seizure ain't it speakin' like a demon
In the coldest darkest region of the planet, I be sleepin'
Like a beast in hibernation, I'm just waitin' for a reason
To awakin' in the season where it's freezin', I be feastin'
On the flesh unless the being force feedin' me to vegans

[Xzibit]
Underestimation been one of my best barometers
Animation, you amateurs, drinking straight out the bottle
I don't haggle or hassle, you fuckin' assholes asked for it
Merciless, miraculous, immaculate, fast forward
Get it how you think you got it, did it while you thought about it
Tucked it when you should of shot it, that ain't how you speak about it
You actin' like you catchin' bodies with that chalker burner
My satisfaction comes from not givin' a fuck about 'em

Repeat Chorus Twice

(Verse 2)
[Paul Wall]
Hey
I'm strapped up like a parachute
They watching yo ass, hurry up and Gimme The Loot (Gimme The Loot...)
For the underdog, waitin' for the levy breach
Chop him like a onion in a bathtub full of bleach
I do the southside and body rock your tombstone
Drown your dog in a pool, make a bong with his bongs
You little clones is sweeter than a scent of the (???)
You never should have fucked with the kid from Acres Homes

[Ryu]
On your grave, I'm a further stare, dancing on your face, yeah
I'm a fuck your kids up, I should run a day care
Teach 'em how to slang H, how to beat a rape case
The champagne's less fillin' than the fame, but it tastes great
That's why I spill it on these bitches when I hit the stage
No disrespect, it just how my gang celebrates
Dues paid, Paid Dues, ace of spades, Grey Goose
A.K.'s and cocaine, peace dudes, hang loose

Repeat Chorus

[Scoop DeVille]
{*scratching*}
"Get, busy"
"Get, busy"
"I'll be dancing on your grave"
"Dancing on your grave"
"Dancing on your grave, dance-dancing on your grave"
"I'll be dancing on your grave"
"Dancing on your grave"
"Dancing on your grave, dance-dance-dance"
{*studders*}

(Verse 3)
[MURS]
I be dancing on your grave, moonwalkin' on your mausoleum
Got the Crypt Keeper crip walkin', man, you gotta see him
I'm out of here, man, your boy is so major
These haters have heat, but I'm fuckin' with these lasers
Act out a favor, now your face is a crater
Real hood nigga dressin' like a pro-skater
I'm O.G., I got money to burn
I'm yellin' GBC and hit my Dougie on ya urn

[Scoop DeVille]
Scoop De, V-I-Double L-E
To the rap game, I'm like Arthur Fonzarelli
Blacked out lights through the club like Belly
Real recognize real, you ain't gotta tell me
You smell me
Puff a, puff a chronic sack
What the fuck is wrong with that
Be afraid, take it to your grave, bitch, promise that
Dancin' on that shit, I be campin' on your crypt
Keep a phantom on my neck, and a mansion on my wrist (Ew!)

Repeat Chorus Twice

[Scoop DeVille]
{*scratching*}
"Get, busy"
"I'll be dancing on your grave"
"Dancing on your grave"
"Dancing on your grave, dance-dancing on your grave"
"I'll be dancing on your grave"
"Dancing on your grave"
"Dancing on your grave, dance-dance-dance"
