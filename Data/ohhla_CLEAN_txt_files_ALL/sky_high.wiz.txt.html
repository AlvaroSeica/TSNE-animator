[Intro/Chorus]
Ah man yeah they talk, but I can't hear what they say
cause I'm flyin' (ohhhh) Yeah, its young khalifa man
yeah they talk but I cant hear what they say, cause I'm flying
taylor gang or die, taylor gang or die, yeah they talk
but I cant hear what they say, cause I'm flyin'
swear they see me, but I'm too many miles away! cause I'm flyin'
in the air, you all the way down
and I'm flyin' to the sky, I don't touch the ground
I'm flyin'

[Wiz Khalifa]
so high I can touch the sky [x10]

[Verse 1]
Im livin this movie, movie, you niggas like tivo
see the same things twice, nothing like me though
man they can dream, flow like a whole key low.
now I got your bitch, try and find me like nino
spend a lot of cash , can't front or I might leave broke
one live to live, 800 on the weed smoke
stacks for them guccis like, fuck it im'a need those
young superstar, well were feelin like heroes
top down, and I'm flying like an eagle
tats on my neck, face, hands like a cholo
all about my green, bout my green like cheelo
stars in my face, no stars not cheenos
smile hard, (hard) swag real mean though
hate enough for, show my ass with my jeans low
started from the bottom, now made it like zero
got it on lockdown, feeling like nino!

[Chorus]

[Wiz Khalifa]
so high I can touch the sky [x8]

[Verse 2]
Now I'm in florida, yeah they know me there too
walkin with jewels out, showin all my tattoos
can't say my name right, but they know I'm that dude
Walk 54 place, niggas eatin fast food
brother out in Lauderdale, cousin down in Van U
Me I got a plug, good drugs when I land too
know I'm underage, not much that I can't do
you don't talk money, thats why I cant understand you
see I'm hot now, going for a grammy though
think this bitch bad, you should see my Miami ho
Down in south beach, met her at the Cameo
Told her what my life like, took her to the Sagamo
100 grand on my neck, just cause I gotta glow
Never buyin dough, whole zips when I gotta blow
always dressed to impress you can tell
she love my cologne, thats money that you smell, yeah!

[Chorus]

[Wiz Khalifa]
so high I can touch the sky [x8]</pre>
