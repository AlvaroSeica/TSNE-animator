[Chorus]
If she want it, I'm gonna give it up
If she running low, I'm gonna fill her cup
If it spill, chill, I'ma clean it up
I'll be right here cause she's enough
If she needed the money, I would stick you up
If she getting bored, I'd do some different stuff
Don't need anything, just keep it up
I'll be right here cause she's enough

[Slug]
She wanna do the damn thang and I'm on her side
She open up the wings and she gonna fly
She got no time for the fuss and fight
She does it right, she loves her life
She the one that put the kick in the drums
She the hot stovetop when the winter comes
She hits the run, she can lift a tonne
She gon' stick to the job and get it done
She hop out and push if the motor's dead
She gotta keep it moving with no regret
She's up in my head never overstep
She let me know when it's time for us to go to bed
She's my lady, case closed
She want a baby, so I gave her one of those
Belly getting big, look at the tits grow
She want a song, so I wrote one and it goes

[Chorus]

[Slug]
She the one that you want to grow old with
She gotta touch it, she wanna hold it
She gets focussed, she got the dopest kiss
She don't need you to tell her, already knows it is
She makes me laugh till I'm on that floor
She don't ask why I adore
She like to travel, so we explore
She seen everything, wanna see some more
She the opposite of selfish
She love house pets, she wanna help kids
She pulled me out my shell
Fit tight like a belt, now the suckers get jealous
Believe it don't get sweeter
She gon' make me sweat like fever
She wanna eat so we went to Dominguez
She want a ring, got me measuring the fingers

[Chorus]

[Slug]
Got me here
What you do now is up to you now
Got me here
What you do now is up to you
Got me here
What you do now is up to you now
Got me here
What you do now is up to you</pre>
