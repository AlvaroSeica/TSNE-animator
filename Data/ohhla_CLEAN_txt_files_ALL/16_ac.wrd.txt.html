[Werd]
I get drunk on stage and shout out check this
Trying not to fuck up the lines like Tetris
See I really want to get a thistle on the necklace
Plus a wont stop though I'm not ment to get this
And you say Werd man I'm holding you down
Thats kind of true you are holding me down
You thought that flow I was over it now
But I'm happy being fly I am over the clouds
I've got no guns I'm not holding the pound
I've got no funds I'm not holding a pound
Its werd mate should know me by now
I gave you all flows so your owing me now
Shit your not fly your just stuck in the web
And I'm a never ending dilemma abbreviated Ned
And fuck with my fam man I'm needing in bread
Because I'm not happy in a scene that seems so dead</pre>
