Yea what up, 1 time, 1 time, PMD, Mic Doc
9-7, 2  thous and beyond, check it, check it

Step aside, peep the wide body, kicking shit like karate
Or catch me on a Harley, but puff like the Marley's
Do narly, tims and rims wit the fat knobbies
The rap teflon don here to crash a party
You know the status, who the baddest wit this apparatus
Who's the fattest, who gives a phuck cuz it don't matter
Always rock shit, high in the cockpit
Infrared lock and hit, terminate the target
Cuz when I put it down, clown, I don't phuck around
How you sound, act like you know or catch a beatdown

(Chorus)
It's the Microphone Doctor, back making housecalls
Many often wonder is MD paid(4x)

Got more stripes than Colin Powell, ?stoned and towel?, I keep my shit rugged
Thuggish rugged, you'se laced wit ice nuggets
Who you shittin me. lyrics spittin and Squad still hittin
Track flippin, we're nippin, politicin
Niggaz trippin, slippin like a transmission
Or blown gasket, you bastard
You get your ass kicked, tuxedo wit the casket
Blowing steam, one half of the dream team
Cream fiends hit 16 on the rhyme scene
Keep it off the meter, rub it wit the dark Caesar
Blow like ether, Grim like the phucking Reaper
When I act out, MC's back out
Pull the mac out, go the distance in the rap out

Chorus

Swinging back, get you dome cracked in combat
Full contact on impact when P react
Keep it cool at all times, bust rhyme
Get mine, black Einstein wit basslines
From hoodies to skullies, skullies down to tims
I'm all in black Benz, trees and trojans
Niggaz frozen, like manic, it's phucking posing
On display, no place, he foreign attache
Case, Hit Squad lace the place
Set the pace like O.J. in the Bronco chase

Chorus</pre>
