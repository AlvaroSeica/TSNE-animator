"Okay, here he is again ladies and gentlemen..."

[Chorus: Crooked I]
Money from the traphouse, beef pull the macs out
Stuntin pull the 'llacs out, in case you cats doubt
(Yeahhhhh) I'm doin everythang I rap about {*blam*}
(Yeahhhhh) And that's on everythang
Standin on the club couch, on the corner thugged out
Bitches pull they tongues out, we pull them ones out
(Yeahhhhh) I'm doin everythang I rap about {*blam*}
(Yeahhhhh) And that's on everythang

[Crooked I]
Every time I rap I leak a joint on the internet
First thing the fans say, "Did Crooked I kill it yet?"
Firin squad, blindfold and cigarette
Smoke a instrumental, then I'ma chew a Nicorette
Hard bars in effect
Rappers livin in my shadow, I should charge y'all rent for my silhouette
I'm the illest, I ain't met no one iller yet
Workaholic, I ain't even met my pillow yet
You in your prime when you rhyme, where you at?
Maybe it's time for your label to sign a new act
The average person'll blink 17,000 times a day
I spit a rhyme every time you do that
Add R-E-M to that, and you got Crooked I
You don't want none of that, you know where my gun is at
If bullets rang to your brain man it's just a fact
Unless your name Boomerang you ain't comin back

[Chorus: Crooked I]
Money from the traphouse, beef pull the macs out
Stuntin pull the 'llacs out, in case you cats doubt
(Yeahhhhh) I'm doin everythang I rap about {*blam*}
(Yeahhhhh) And that's on everythang
Standin on the club couch, on the corner thugged out
Bitches pull they tongues out when we pull them ones out
(Yeahhhhh) I'm doin everythang I rap about {*blam*}
(Yeahhhhh) And that's on everythang, yeah

[Crooked I]
This industry is full of way too many lames
They know who they are, ain't gotta say too many names
It's like they on a pitcher's mound shootin from downtown on 4th down
They playin way too many games
But I don't play though, G's molded me like some Play-Doh
And still I'm philosophical as Plato
I ain't hatin on you other artist's music
Try to dumb down, guess I'm too smart to do it
Maybe I'll go somewhere and think of a dance
That'll be the same day I rock a crease in my pants
Rather tell a bank teller "Better meet my demands
Put the cash in my palms or have a beast on your hands"
I'm the type of dude who'll put you in an ambulance
If it's beef I'm shootin at QD3's cameraman
Go 'head, stick your chest out famalam
This ain't a mammogram - hold up

[Chorus: Crooked I]
I get money from the traphouse, beef pull the macs out
Stunt pull the 'llacs out, in case you cats doubt
(Yeahhhhh) I'm doin everythang I rap about {*blam*}
(Yeahhhhh) And that's on everythang, hold up
Standin on the club couch, on the corner thugged out
Bitches stick they tongue out, I pull them ones out
(Yeahhhhh) I'm doin everythang I rap about {*blam*}
(Yeahhhhh) And that's on everythang, hold up

[Crooked I]
When I'm spittin I hope you're findin the art
When I'm rhymin I'm minin for diamonds, I shine in the dark
I'm a neurologist slash cardiologist, I'ma touch your mind and your heart
I feel like I'm designin a art
Bullshit is floodin this rap world
We +Lost+ like that +Black Girl+ in Nas' song
All eyes on me, you claim to be liver you got some nerve
You ain't a tighter beat writer, you not superb
This Eastsider reach higher
Fresh out the deep fryer so you know that each line is too hot to serve
You rock with herbs
Retire, leave while ya got ya pride, peace bye, do not disturb
Who got the urge, to be nicer when I'm speakin?
I'm tryin to remind ya of 2Pac with words
Word, this is Makaveli's retaliation
Bring the +Blues+ to your +House+, quicker than Live Nation

[Chorus: Crooked I]
Still in the traphouse, beef pull the macs out
Stunt pull the 'llacs out, in case you cats doubt
(Yeahhhhh) I'm doin everythang I rap about {*blam*}
(Yeahhhhh) And that's on everythang
Yo I'm standin on the club couch, on the corner thugged out
Bitches pull they tongues out, I pull them ones out
(Yeahhhhh) I'm doin everythang I rap about {*blam*}
(Yeahhhhh) And that's on everythang, blaow!
