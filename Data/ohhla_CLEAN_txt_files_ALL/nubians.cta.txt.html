[Infinito 2017]
I'm like truth supplied in a fictional world
Where a man got the nerve to dress up like a girl
Under earth like Shambala, well versed in who I am
Step on you like Watusi, Big Shaq types
Enter this world like meteorites, aight? Spoken word
Slap a government official, no I don't like Bush
Ishtar studyin socialized reading all books
Looks can be deceiving I'm like, triple darkness
You see me as a black hole, youths teleported
Your time machine will not help you travel like a Hebrew, sham me down
You doing Hinduish devil worship
Cats see me with George P-Funk Parliament, I'm a soul man
And I know man, walking tornado, stop sucking my air in
The Garden of Eden, Adamites of the 24 elders
Greeting known today as cloning
Black people spend what they don't have to buy what they don't need, uh

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Complication, this is my application
Breaking the spell, of the United Nations
Through procreation, watch the planet's devistation
As I continue on you face your annihilation

[Infinito 2017]
Nonchalant, narcotic free, never lost
RIght here in touch with reality
Music to me is artistic, catch the half time, turned up twisted
Countering the conspiracy to destroy black boys listen
To the trade news on {?} and see how words can become
an outlet for creativity, unorthodox for society
The sky doesn't have to distort his voice to show prison
Excellent appearance and knew the city of the sun
Check the scrolls from lower to upper Egypt
With an eye all-seeing never blind
Crossed the Nile River with something of importance
Too much slang to pronounce everythang
Y'all hate on me because I don't throw on a out-of-town accent
to make a new song, to make a new song, to make a new song
To make a new song, to make a new song, to make a new song
To make a new song, to make a new song, to make a new, song
Yeah, uh-huh

[Chorus] - 1/2</pre>
