Ha, uh, uh, yeah, uh

[Verse 1 - Akrobatik]
No need to overexert
I just cool out and let my vocals and the beat do the work
Yo, the rhyme wizard (who?), payin suckers a visit
I'm about to stack bank (what?), like the '78 Blizzard
Mad rappers come off flat like snow shoes
They need to fix their shit with Cool Edit or Pro Tools
I bring it effortless and your posse of niggaz hate it
But I'm chiller than Martini &amp; Rossi refrigerated
When I flow raps (what?), I'm comin off the top like Sno-Caps
And then I toss writtens, to leave you frostbitten
You'll search for ice packs like you was hit by Tyson
I'm the first nigga to bring rap from Boston to Iceland
What I throw y'all, hits harder than snowballs
With rocks hidden in 'em (hidden in 'em), lyrical hypnotism (hypnotism)
Will put you in a trance, so MC's don't have a chance (have a chance)
I bowl 'em over like a Colorado Avalanche
I leave 'em coughin and wheezin
As if them cats was left ass naked in climates below freezin (freezin)
So what you enter my center for?
I storm hard like Cappadonna's verse on +Winter Warz+
Forty below, storm trooper to face ya
Control crowds (control crowds), that's harder to move than glaciers (glaciers)
You know the steez of the nicest beat rocker (rocker)
I freeze your beef like a meat locker son, I'm too chill

[Chorus] - w/ ad libs and scratches
"Too chill, too chill, too chill, too chill"
"Too chill, too chill, too chill, too chill"
"Sub-zero degrees can't freeze the cool breeze" - Butterfly of Digable Planets
"Too chill, too chill, too chill, too chill"
"Too chill, too chill, too chill, too chill"
"Sub-zero degrees can't freeze the cool breeze" - Butterfly of Digable Planets

[Verse 2 - Akrobatik]
Your teeth chatter, when I spit my data
But it freezes before it reaches ya, hits the ground and shatters
You shakin from the fear or the hypothermia?
Expose you to my elements, delirious it's turnin ya 
Lyrical cryogenics will leave your bones numb (numb)
And it entertains the people, so the people goin to come
To see my light that ass up like the Winter Festival
Flow so cold that many think I'm kin to Eskimos (no doubt)
Plus my breeze is ever flowin
Hit you with a flurry, even in places it's never snowin
And other rappers hatin on somethin that's this nice (this nice)
It's only 'cause they skatin on thin ice (thin ice)
But when they fall through (through), I still drop joints on all you (all you)
Loungin the crowd with a cold, tall brew (cold, tall brew)
Enter in my turf, you rather go to Siberia
You be shittin on yourself like you had diphtheria
I'm chillin in the freezer in your dorm cafeteria
So run and cop that Akro material (material, 'terial)
I'm +Cold As Ice+ like M.O.P.
+A Kid In The Ghetto+ like Ed O.G.
Knockin immature MC's from tricycles
Hittin 'em with darts that's sharp as icicles
Yo, does Akrobatik burn? No question (question)
But sometimes you gots to chill and now I'm takin that suggestion

[Chorus] - w/ ad libs and scratches

"Too chill, too chill, too chill, too chill"</pre>
