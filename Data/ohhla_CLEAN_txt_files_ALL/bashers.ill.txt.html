[Intro: Raheem]
It's like the Diary of a Madman
If I'm ready, yes, I can, yes I can can

[Ill Knob]
Yo, word up, we gots to flip this
Let this niggaz know we in the business
Strong-armin, move away, I don't know who is this
The rap bashers, night slashers, mic masters
Street actors, the Klik rocks the best of street action
State action, no fraction
The population should put that to test
The K, the G up in the industry
all my niggaz who feelin this shit
Fuck ya, I'm killin this shit
I'm Knob-arologist, the psychiatrist
The Klik of rhymers, word to mother, bring the drama

[Raheem]
You don't like me, I don't give a fuck, fuck ya
You gots to hear me, I'm causin chaos, no mayhem
While my mind ills like Riker's Island shields
Your brain swells, know some stories that he or she tells
While my mind dwells in darkness
Weepin as she's cursed and he's heartless
I'm in this to win this, demolish
Deminish, I mean it, ya finished
Your memory's gone, migraine born
I'm goin on and on on

[Adriatic]
The lies control my mind got me wide like this
The lies control my mind got me wide...
The lies control my mind got me wide like this
With a crooked eye twitch from all the grooves in my system
My Klik'll represent daily, that's mandatory
We paid our dues in this, niggaz abusin this
Ya bruised in this, MC's meet defeat
Ya'll switch, tell me why shit goes down like this
Everyday I stalk the streets, gotta pack my 4-5th
Why do I? That's the crew, I gets down
Half my peeps either dead or on lock down
Domes get bashed, niggaz get caught up it's path

[Chorus: Ill Knob]
The rap bashers
"Y'all respect it buck" -- ???
It be the rap bashers
"Y'all respect it buck" -- ???
It be the rap bashers
"Y'all respect it buck" -- ???

[Ill Knob]
What? Yo, protect yours, independent
Klik Ga Bow be runnin shit, runnin shit
Watch ya back or get hit with the stunnin shit
Drop ya gun and shit, double with the knuckle game
Nigga, Knob don't give a damn about the fuckin fame
The rap bashers are here, representin real live niggaz
Bitch niggaz just stare
You pussies gettin more dick than Heather Hunter
No wonder, Ga Bow's style make 'em fall under

[Raheem]
How you want it? Ga Bow serve that ass in 3/4th's
Holocaust get brought, intersection in my fort
The shady nigga maintain C.I. state of mind
Rugged down, scuffed up Timbs and bad dimes
Jet through in the MP, many lie, milk D
'Bout to get bombed off LP
True to this, my dunns bust guns since day one
On a mission, the Klik pay they dues for opposition
Death wishin, when shit get thick, the gat spit
God damn, another young brotha hit

[Adriatic]
The realest immortal mind
So keep protectin while I'm disconnectin
Interceptin, be connectin, disrespectin, neglectin
Perfectin many ways, increase slaves to my rhythm
How can you be down? Create a sound to be with 'em
Tryin, bitin, not one dimension
Who saw and did shit? Heard they gave info quick
The immortal nimrod neutral, but if I have to I'll shoot you
Reduce two shells, leave ya body layin where you dwell
Shape shiftin, plans the braveheart, grant the immortal mind
Ramel gets slow shine, that's what you do, now it's my time
My intention is determined, that this beat you can't delete
Quick, Bring Da Ruckus, we'll wiz randomly
J. Web pass the wave, peace to Smooth locked away
Healthy phantoms, to boogie, let's all pave the way
Selfish ones, I told you, "Do you dare interfere?" (echo)

[Chorus]
