Peep the story 
Sonny Cheeba, Geechie Suede 
Check it out 
Volume 1 of this joint 

[Geechie Suede] 
I ski in Switzerland 
Down in morocco gamblin', handlin' 
B.I. for my crooks back in the BX, sex, collect wines 
Italian designs, quicksilver 
Come paint the canvas if needed but should it be not 
Cause everything goes accordin' to plan 

[Sonny Cheeba] 
Yo killin' em softly 
Makin' em cop plea 
Blessin' the black leaf 
Stakin' with 40 thieves 
Now diggy bruh, time to conjugate on my delegates 
Shikaka, all of bo daggin', from the tri-borough 
In they dime, lita named sunshine 
The lower for lana diggy now 
Rockin' his pocket flo the mass that 
Hackensack, highway to holly for this cashmere 
Satin pro, got the somali, rolls on my mind 

[Geechie Suede] 
In france i dance by the moon 
Sailin' from cancun, steamin' vega's lace 
Limpin' with some delegates that put me on 
Capridi scarf around my neck, little red corvette 
We got some merchandise to heist 
Up in canada we move 

[Sonny Cheeba] 
Right, right, right 

Chorus: 
Callin' up the diamond delegates 
Black connection 
For the sonny cheeba and the suede 
Black connection 
Got the bronx brooklyn and the harlem 
Black connection 
All the triborough got the back of black connection 

[Sonny Cheeba] 
She scored me up, told me rolls are dyin' 
Wired geechie suede, be right there 
For this caravan, to relieve the bread 
Harlem brook bx 
Catch the character that snatched the goods 
Huggy bear 
Put me on to the will on it hit the gas 

[Geechie Suede] 
I got the wire 
Ignored it, then poured it real slow in tekida's glass 
Her radiance, radiance smilin', diamonds giorgio splash 
The suede is aroused and caress and caribbean gems 
The squeezin' of jizza is stimulated now on my bend 
Lent symphonies, left a crystal rock i copped at tiffany's 
She sniffed her arm, let her hair down and paced the balcony 
I scraped the well 
Dada have her on the score for years, but backed into hawk 
Who pullin' shiest manuevers on my camp, yeah 

[Sonny Cheeba] 
I don't understand, what the fuck is up, where my man 
Eat a bowl of hot cock, now sonny cheeba volume one 
Catch the mighty bullion cat, comin' out the door, what what 
Arby's over top, mop 'em up, juke his monkey ass 

Chorus 

[Geechie Suede] 
My huggy bear connect, connect 
Me cautious, I enter a flamin' scorch, you by the door, moolah 
All over the floor time to gather 
As much as i can tryin' not to get blam off in a vicious 
Get message to cheeba, in need of assistance right now 

[Sonny Cheeba] 
Then i get the rumble on the hip, i hit her fuzz 
Gotta split, give my peeps who wants sober 
Suede in town, bridge bound 
See the shiesty eyes, filled in double o 
This is it, thru the corridor 
Hit the floor, time y'all pack it up 
What y'all laughin' at 
Loose cannons, blaze my hathaway 
Shake a leg, into the hallway, vision geechie suede 
Coolie high cats 
Back to back, bout to see the gates 
Twist of fate, ease up into the room, let the guns play 

[Geechie Suede] 
Avoid the penal in jeopardy with no ammo to blow 
But me and my a-c goin' out in less than zero, oh no 
Now here come the crooks 
Paradin' by storm with the luegers and oar 
We conquer ground as usual 
Lo empire can never fall 
yeah 

Chorus x 2 

[Sonny Cheeba]
