(*talking*)
Man huh, just shock rock man
Uh it's going down, for the 2000
E.S.G., and my partna Big Moe
Say, we want the whole Dirty 3rd to do this with us baby

(*Big Moe*)
Drop your top, and roll with me
It's the Big Moe, and that E.S.G.
Boys bleeding blocks, in these H-Town streets
Man it's going down, making ghetto history

[E.S.G.]
Two triple O back in the do, bout to drop tops with the boy Big Moe
Screwed Up Click we super thick, been dropping hits since '94
Now y'all know just how it go, hit the block so sipping on a fo'
Wreckshop dropping tops, P-A-T told you that befo'
Bought the house bought the boat, ask Reck and Noke I'ma buy some mo'
E.S.G. that's who I be, with diamonds on teeth I'm the freestyle pro
Thoed in the game platinum chain, swang and bang or bo'guard the lane
Piece on the neck at the Crawfish Fest, or the Bayou Classic I'ma do my thang
Syrup in the cup man hol' up, Cadillac truck sitting on buck
Gotta put it up for the summer time, pull out the drop top if you wanna shine
Where the 6-4's at where the Regals at, where them drop tops at and them Cadillacs
Don't care what you in or where you at, let the top back fire up a sack
If you feeling good if you looking good, if you looking good you feeling good
Get your blings on turn the screens on, go 'head boy just grip the wood
Point understood I knew I could, make the Southside body rock with me
Swang and bang I'm back in the game, come on y'all drop tops with me

[Hook]
Drop your top, and roll with me
It's the Big Moe, and that E.S.G.
Boys bleeding blocks, on these H-Town streets
Man it's going down, making ghetto history
Chunk up the deuce, if you feeling me now
Body rocking shocking, on the damn Southside
We be coming down, blazing on the pine
Still jamming Screw, staying on the grind yeah

[Big Moe]
Southside, still holding
Baby on the Southside, we be rolling
Southside, we be rolling on those choppers
Southside, we be breaking them off proper
It's Big Moe in the do', sipping a pint you keep the fo'
Hit the Boulevard my trunk gon glow, that's the way the Drank Baby roll
On the scene that is my click, give me a note I hit a grip
Anything for mine will some, garunteed to be some
I'ma come down banging Screw, popping trunk rolling through
Gotta feel a G like me, M-O-E and E.S.G.
We some thoed dudes, from the Southside
On the mic G, and we are going live

[Hook]

[Big Moe]
Stay on my grind, gotta stay on my grind
If you wanna shine, if you wanna shine
I gotta stay on the grind, I gotta stay on the grind
If you wanna shine, if you wanna shine
I gotta stay on the grind, I gotta stay on the grind
If you wanna shine, if you wanna shine
On my grind is where I be, take a tip from M-O-E
I'm a throed G, from the S.U.C.

[E.S.G.]
Come roll with us come roll with us, if it's platinum or gold then you know it's us
S.U.C. and the Drank Baby, if it ain't Screwed up it ain't slow enough
Bob your head man roll your red, get your grind on and forget the FED's
It's going down in H-Town, playa look around we ain't scared
We ball the most on the 3rd Coast, I ain't trying to brag ain't trying to boast
They should bump it out break down a pound, throw on your loc's man roll up the smoke
Put it in the air I don't care, if you rich if you on welfare
I'ma drop my top then bleed the block, rocks on my wrist man watch it glare
Watch 'em bling watch 'em gleam, Martin Luther King I'ma hit the scene
Pinky ring got playas on my team, major ones like the boy Mean Green
Sipping on lean call it codein, Alpine system with the fo' fifteens
Boom-boom ta-da-ta-da, surround by sound it's clean-clean
Freestyle King big bezeltyne, Iceberg shirt with the matching jeans
Let the top down watch the wind blow, whoa look like Don King
Song right here for the summer time, Southside playa gon shine and grind
East Coast West Coast, now y'all know it's 3rd Coast's time
