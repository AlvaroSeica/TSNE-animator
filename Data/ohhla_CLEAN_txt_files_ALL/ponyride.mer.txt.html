Verse 1 (Mercedes)

Baby light a candle, I wanna get you in the mood
slip you into my bedroom, and show you the freaky things that I can do
Let me take you places,  so let your body just recieve
hope your feeling my emotions baby, you got me in ecstacy

Verse 2: (O'Dell)

Alright, alright, alright
Explore your every avenue, I'll show you everything I can do
girl let me take yo everywhere, places that you wonder
Go on and on and on all night, I'll touch you tease you
please don't bite, you know you want what soldiers do
so let me show it to you

Chorus: (Mercedes, Erica Foxx, Ms. Peaches)

Let me take you on a pony ride, just get inside, while I'm nice and high 
Oh my loving goes on and on and on and on and on
Let me take you on a pony ride, just get inside, while I'm nice and high 
Oh my loving goes on and on and on and on and on

Verse 3: (Ms. Peaches)

Come and lay your body down, right here next to me
the temperature is rising, I know you can feel the heat
See I know, I know, I know, you've had a long night
but I promise when I give you my love, everything will be alright

Verse 4: (Erica Foxx)

Let me take you away, to place unlike you've ever known
I'll give you love from me, cause now you are at home
Let me get you close to me, I will give you what you need
Tonight's the night sweet baby, so get into me

Chorus: 

Let me take you on a pony ride, just get inside, while I'm nice and high 
Oh my loving goes on and on and on and on and on
Let me take you on a pony ride, just get inside, while I'm nice and high 
Oh my loving goes on and on and on and on and on

Let me take you on a pony ride, just get inside, while I'm nice and high 
Oh my loving goes on and on and on and on and on
Let me take you on a pony ride, just get inside, while I'm nice and high 
Oh my loving goes on and on and on and on and on
Let me take you on a pony ride, just get inside, while I'm nice and high 
Oh my loving goes on and on and on and on and on
Let me take you on a pony ride, just get inside, while I'm nice and high 
Oh my loving goes on and on and on and on and on</pre>
