[Intro]
Ste-phen {*2X*}
Why won't you call me?
Stephen, why won't you call me?

[Ke$ha]
I, saw you, in your tight ass rocker pants
You saw me too, I laughed, cause I was completely trashed
And I watched your ug-ly girlfriend sneer across the room
As if I real-ly care, that she's here with you; all I know is
You're my object of affection
My drug of choice, my sick obsession

[Chorus]
Stephen, why won't you call me?
I'm sitting here waiting, why won't you call me?
Stephen, I'm feeling pathetic
I can't take rejection, why won't you call me?

[Ke$ha]
I've, got guys, waiting in a line
for me to play, my evil girly games with all their minds
Just watch me I've got it down, to a simple art
Just bat my eyes, like this, and there's a broken heart but somehow
You turned the tables, what the hell?
I can charm the pants of anyone else.. but you

[Chorus]

[Ke$ha]
Stephen, I'm thinking that, maybe
You might think I'm, crazy
Is that why you won't call me?
Steve, don't you think I'm pretty?
Do you not love me?
Is that why you won't call me?
Cause you're my object of affection
My drug of choice, my sick obsession
I want to keep you as my pet to play with
and hide under my bed.. forever

[Chorus]

[Ke$ha]
Stephen, I'll knit you a sweater
I want to wrap you up in my love.. forever
I'll never let you go Stephen, I'll never let go

[Chorus]</pre>
