[Intro: Tyga]
{Mustard on the beat~!} AUGHH~!
I say fuck them other niggas cause I'm down for my niggas (what)
Fuck them other niggas cause I'm down for my niggas (what)
Fuck them other niggas, I ride for my niggas
I die for my niggas - nigga I hit 'em up!

[Tyga]
T-Raww go stay Westside, killa cap peela
No ceiling, probably worth 10 million
Poor nigga watch chilla, you ain't even gotta feel it
That's chin chinchilla flyer than a caterpillar
I sick my dogs at you (you), yeah
They ain't call the dog catcher (catcher), bitch
Spark the fire, no matches (matches), yeah
So high just laughin', hah (hah)
Burners in the attic, they ain't know I had it; shoot sporadic
Fire automatic, pop the target, driving backwards
I'm a hundred bill fanatic, bring the static (BITCH~!)
Make vows to the money, but I skipped marriage (WOO!)
Keep starin', rather die that nigga than live average, get you embarrassed
Thousand karats on my wheel that my kids inherit
Black card credit, told them I don't use debit (no!)
Nigga know that's my motto, I could do this shit forever so

[Chorus: Tyga]
I say fuck them other niggas cause I'm down for my niggas (what)
Fuck them other niggas cause I'm down for my niggas (what)
Fuck them other niggas, I ride for my niggas
I die for my niggas, talkin' get you hit up (AUGHH~!)
I say fuck them other niggas cause I'm down for my niggas (what)
Fuck them other niggas cause I'm down for my niggas (what)
Fuck them other niggas, I ride for my niggas
I die for my niggas - nigga I hit 'em up!

[Jadakiss]
What! What! D-Block - HA-HEEAAH~! Uh, yo..
We don't rock with them niggas anyway, fuck 'em (fuck em)
We'd ever caught them in the hood, we'd a stuck 'em (mm)
Things comin' in, we get them off by the dozen
We about that action, y'all ain't about nothin' (nothin')
Girl of your dreams, I already had her (yeah)
If it ain't my team, it don't really matter (uh-uh)
Short stay, I'm only in town for the figures (money)
Even when I'm up, I'm still down for my niggas
Need nothing else, don't concern me or worry me (nah)
Nah, I'mma ride 'til they burn me or bury me (yeah)
Cause the truth is, niggas die every day (yup)
Heard about me, I hope you heard thoroughly (mwah)
I don't switch sides (nah), I just switch rides
Might just get a little head, let the bitch slide (mm)
Knowing that I can (yeah), knowin' that I will
Far as the other side go, you know how I feel
What! HA-HAAEEH~!

[Chorus]

[2Pac] + (Tyga)
You gotta watch your back, stay strapped, be alert
Started as a young motherfucker doin' dirt (BITCH~!)
Walkin' through the streets wearin' jewels (ain't got shit to lose)
(Gonna fuck up and bust young niggas with tools)
The intricate designs of my lethal lines
(Now time hard to find a job, easier to rob niggas)
These days, motherfuckers talk shit, and turn snitch when you see 'em
They ain't talkin' 'bout shit - W-W-Westside
I keep a vest on my chest (BITCH~!)
Buck, buck, cops wanna hit me with the book
(But I don't give a fuck, government got a nigga feelin' stuck)
(While these same little sluts gettin' fucked for a quick buck)
(Weed make my mind roam) all alone
Ain't nothin' like tryna bone; over the phone
in my mind I can see her naked, I can't take it
Got me shakin' at the thought that we can make it
I thought you knew (bitch!) Get LOADED! Can't control it
Nigga, pass me the blunt and let me roll it (t-then smoke it)
(Sippin') Hennessy (plottin' on my enemies)
(Comin back twice as hard like, "Remember me?")
A hustler to my dyin' days, (niggas dyin' every day)
(And we celebrate with pain, pourin' champagne)
(Street politics, they wanna join my campaign)
(Worldwide, LA niggas screamin') Westside
