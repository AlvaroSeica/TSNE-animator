Q-Tip:

Just feelin' things out for real, ya know?
Just wanna do me for real, ya know?
No reason to make it complicated, you feelin' agitated, 
You love it or you hate itâ¦fuck it
Desperation, jumpin' off of street corners here
Hustlahz lookin for buzz like "pop one in here"
Local state officialsâ¦.yeah they out of touch
Getting money for some, aiyo, ain't nothin' much
But yoâ¦let them tell it, we smoke it and we sell it
You don't understand, so don't tell it
You sneakin' souls just for phat diamond golds
Cuz our lady friends have likings for designer clothes
People in my hood thinkâ¦.if I'm lookin raggedy, then the cat is just a weak 
link
In the very fake chain of oppressionâ¦.if television taught me any lesson, it's
"Image is Nothing", but yo I got a thirstâ¦Nothing, but yo I got a thirst
Nothing, but yo I got a thirstâ¦what's first?  Your rings or your purse?

Jonathan Davis (KoRn):

(Oh boyâ¦oh boy!  Make your wagers back there!  Step livelyâ¦women and 
children first!  The world is coming to an end!  Come on nowâ¦we're looking at 
the end!  We have to leave themâ¦we have to leave all our paraphanelias 
behindâ¦.{brought backâ¦brought backâ¦.[repeated]} LET'S GOOOOO!)

It's kinda scary you seeâ¦.
How fucked up things can be
Each time you take a bath
How it could have been your last
There's so much shit around us
Things we can't even see
Is this the end of our line?
That's where I wanna beâ¦.that's where I wanna be
That's where I want to beâ¦.that's where-I want-to be
