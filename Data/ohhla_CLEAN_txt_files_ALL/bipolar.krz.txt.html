Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Here's a story bout'a little boy who wasn't so bad
Silent but he feelin'so sad, as a young lad he lost his dad
Momma didn't have much, but thankful for the things she had
Mom and sister was the parenting system, tucked him in his bed at night
Then on his head she'd kiss him, but lights go out is when it started, yea
Little Christopher became very scared, so there, in his closet things began to move
Back and forth, that of course was all in his head, don't need no sugar fo'bed
Was the meaning, waking up from a dream screaming, all the while singing, that I...

[Chorus: x2]
I got an upside down, smile tonight
Gotta wipe my frown, dry my eyes
Kids this is how it is when you're older
Wake up, and you're Bipolar

Before he became a man, He almost lost his fam, sis, and mom again
In the school bathroom vomitin', he's shaken up, mood swings who swings when waking up
Dude seems cool, but really breakin'up. People go in and out of his life, He missed out on his wife
So he decides to go and grab a knife, and take his-self to the other side of the sun
Cause if he stays here then more pain'll just come. Take him away from this
If he could escape from this, he'd even pay to make this his last day
Then a ray from the sky shined on him, and God smiled on him
And now the whole world gets to hear him sing.

[Chorus: x2]
I got an upside down, smile tonight
Gotta wipe my frown, dry my eyes
Kids this is how it is when you're older
Wake up, and you're Bipolar

Pull you're self up out of it, even if you doubt it
You can live without it, Just forget about it
I know you tried to drown it, Tried to get up out it
Head to the sky and shout it.

[Chorus: x2]
I got an upside down, smile tonight
Gotta wipe my frown, dry my eyes
Kids this is how it is when you're older
Wake up, and you're Bipolar</pre>
