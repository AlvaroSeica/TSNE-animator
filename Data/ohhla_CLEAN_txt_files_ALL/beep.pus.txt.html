[Chorus - Will.I.Am]
It's funny how a man only thinks about the [*BEEP*]
You got a real big heart, but I'm lookin at yo' [*BEEP*]
You got real big brains, but I'm lookin at yo' [*BEEP*]
Girl, it ain't no pain in me lookin at yo'  [*BEEP*]

[PCD Girl]
I don't give a [*BEEP*], Keep lookin at my [*BEEP*]
'Cause it don't mean a thang if you're lookin at my [*BEEP*]
Heh, I'ma do my thing while you're playin wit ya [*BEEP*]
Ha, ha-ha, ha-ha-HA...

[Nicole Scherzinger]
Every boy's the same
Since up in the seventh grade
They been trying to get with me
Tryna - ha-ha-haaa, ha-ha-haaaa
They always got a plan
To be my one and only man
Want to hold me with their hands
Want to - ha-ha-haaa, ha-ha-haaaa
I keep turning them down
But they always come around
Asking me to go around
That's not the way it's going down

'Cause they only want, only want
My - ha-ha-haaaa, ha-ha-haaaa
Only want, what they want
But, na ah-ahhhh, na, ah-ahhhh

[Chorus - Will.I.Am]
It's funny how a man only thinks about the [*BEEP*]

[PCD Girl]
I don't give a [*BEEP*], Keep lookin at my [*BEEP*]
'Cause it don't mean a thang if you're lookin at my [*BEEP*]
Heh, I'ma do my thing while you're playin wit ya [*BEEP*]
Ha, ha-ha, ha-ha-HA...

[Nicole Scherzinger]
Do you know that no
don't mean yes, it means no?
So just hold up, wait a minute
Let me put my two cents in it
One; just be patient
Don't be rushing like you're anxious
And two; you're just too aggressive
So try to get your [*gasps*]

Do you know... that I know?
And I don't... want to go there...

Only want, only want
My - ha-ha-haaaa, ha-ha-haaaa
Only want, what they want
But, na ah-ahhhh, na, ah-ahhhh

[Chorus - Will.I.Am]
It's funny how a man only thinks about the [*BEEP*]
