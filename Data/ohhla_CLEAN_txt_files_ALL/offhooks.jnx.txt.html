Holla At Me

[Verse 1]
Ayo
Im'a tell you why I'm angry, haters in the game wanna restrain me
I'm what they artist can't be, chain hang see
Down to the dick, A clown wanna flip
Keep a pound on the hip, lay him down with a clip
Yall niggaz aint ready for Juvy, and aint a nigga betta then Juvy
I'm a veteran excuse me
I've been flowin awhile, young flashy ass nigga stay throwin em down
Dip's where fitted, too exquisite, enemies lord forgive em
More shells in the clip, the more hit em
Go in his body blood draw drippin, send him to the mortician
Face it I'm hot, the boy gifted
Look listen, the game's in a boston crab
I'm just a bastard who was born to rap
Hot on the beat slaughter the track
I'm here to kill a whole industry, I dont get along with rap. Niggaz!!

[Chorus - repeat 2X]
Mufuckas off the hook this year
You can bet Jinx is gonna cook this here
Half yall niggaz lookin shook in here, crooks in here
Tuck in your chain dont get jooks in here

[Verse 2]
Yeah
I know the streets been waitin 2003 I'm here to take over man

This year niggaz cant eat, find a new occupation
CEO's find another artist stop hatin
The streets been waitin along time for the kid
I'm bout to go to trail rappers hopin I do a bid
Who really want it? Lets go shell for shell
I'm the best thing to happin to Def Jam since L.L
Oh well its the truth, The flow leak through
Imbecile rap, still push coke and Diesel
I put them birds in you, out of the eagle
I dont say your name on record, I'll holla when I see you
See me I'm nice with mines, most the rappers in the game need me to write they rhymes
You a eightball shaver, slicin dimes
Im a two brick nigga, light blue six nigga
You niggaz got a lot to learn, I take seven figures off every block I burn nigga

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
J, I, N, X
JUVY!!!!!!!!

I got my mind on my money, money on my mind
Fuck 16 bars, I need money per line
My flow hot like a curl and iron
Playa while you at work your girl is mine
But when I come home homie I give her back to ya
Throw her like a doe yo, never give her no dough
Shorty head so good, might as well go pro
I mean what can I say? I'm a pimp
Aint cuz the products to small I walk with a limp
I just walk with a limp
Fitted cap low, gorgeous gangsta so you know I attract hoes
You rap assholes got me aggravated
Stop complain four-fifth cock and bang it
You know the name if you want it come and see me
Why say my name on radio or a t.v? (don't do that)
Please believe me I'm focused man
It aint my 2-way that got my waist bulging man

Ah ha
Yeah
This year I'm focused
All that rap trash
I'm here to clean it all up man

[Chorus]

[Talking]
Yeah man
Tuck your chain man
The streets is here man
