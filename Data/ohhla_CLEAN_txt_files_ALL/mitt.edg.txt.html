[Intro]
His looks are ordinary, but he does things in the dark
I tell you he would get to you, he's out to do you haaaaarm
So that if you're threatened, if evil's ever done
You'll know it's him that did it, you'll know that he's the one..
 
[Edo G]
So you promise me you'll fix the economy
Honestly, you trust Mitt's honesty
His money and property, improperly, rich man robbery
He's gon' do it, not probably (what?)
Return us to them glory years - Bush policies
Please follow me, he lacks in concern
Crash and burn, which will it hidin in them tax returns
He's shrinkin, gettin smaller, watch him wittle down
Leans so far to the right, can't find a middle ground!
We on Main St., he's on Madison
50K a plate, with that dude Sheldon Adelson
He's not quick on his feet, NOR is he nimble
Looks to racist Rush Limbaugh as his conservative symbol?
What kind of politics he into?!
We've yet to hear ya story, we know what you've been through
To be a president, you got to adore people
Not ignore people, especially the poor people
Entitlement cuts, that means welfare
Get your money elsewhere, G.O.P. no help here
But he gave Massachusetts health care
Flip-flopper, that's a picture of his face
Get rid of Obamacare? Repeal and replace?
He's out of touch!
 
(So that if you're threatened, if evil's ever done
You'll know it's him that did it, you'll know that he's the one..)

[Chorus]
Mitt Romney, John Boehner
Mitch McConnell, friends with the Donald
Scott Brown, Rubio, Ryan
Laura Ingraham, Fox News, they lyin!
Rush Limbaugh, Coulture and Drudge
calledTthe President, everything short of a thug
Chris Christie, Newt Gingrich
Act like we don't all speak English
Yo, I'm a trying man, not a lying man
The poor's cryin man, he support the damn Ryan plan
You alive stupid, or dead smart?
It cuts Medicare, food stamps, Pell Grants, Head Start
That's just to name a few, this what he aim to do (Mitt)
And if you votin for that?! Then I'm blamin you
Shame on you/U-2 Bono, he raised money the Donald
Block everything, Mitch McConnell
Not for the people, the average Americans
Make Barack, a one-term president
Edo's a entertainer, Obama vote, no brainer
Instead of leaderless, John Boehner
No gun control laws, everybody got a shotty
Controlled by radicals, called the Tea Party
They out of touch!
 
(So that if you're threatened, if evil's ever done
You'll know it's him that did it, you'll know that he's the one..)
