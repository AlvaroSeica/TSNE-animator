summertime 09
flashbacks summertime 95
we can take it back to that timeline
clinton in office
niggas was beefing then about getting the system off us
dealing with different tortures
economy in a surplus
you could tell by a nigga acts
yall came from caddillacs to lex coups and slicker ac's
karl kani jeans
gary payton sneaks bigger hats
no shirt
on ya stomach I miss my nigga tats
old gold slow sippage
black n mild known incense
yall kept the shotti screwface
and smiled in no pictures
I was a little yuko
watching the older niggas shift from in and out of grouphomes
my family was too broke
corn flakes for breakfast
ramen noodles for lunch
pot pies for dinners how I remember it
getting in trouble for playin in the street
tryna watch the pretty girls double dutch
they was killin it
I wanted what I seen my white friends having
so I schemed from then to make the shit happen god willing it
coming in late to asswhoopins
sorry moms
she would get stressed then rest
playin minnie ripperton
pops he a mystery
that was a man I always heard about
but it was hard to make him out visually
but I dont harbor hard feelings
thats gods card dealing
upon chillin he giving that outta prison speech
but I aint tryna hear it
so link up with my uncles
cause they was cool
would drink brews and build on some lyrics
like
summertime 95 when cuban linx dropped
the infamous too
I was just getting into hip hop
the shinin
clue tapes doo wop
biggie smalls singles
that me against the world shit from tupac
we didnt recognize that moment in time
at least now I get to show my love to it in rhyme
son

remember back then
them carhart days
niggas had the half moon invading they waves
but what about now
we cant call it
we wanna go back but we must advance forward
thats a flash forward


summertime 09
summertime 95 memories
got me tryna figure the differences
now I sip the old gold slow
Instead of watching niggas
the po po still spot and stop to get us
obama in office
osama wont forfit
Its true a lots changed
but when I walk in moms house
there go minnie ripperton
she still asking why im late
everythings the same
the moneys at recession levels
for a minute gas was nuts
bailout plans
old people tryna pass the buck
the corner stores is still populated
niggas shootin dice
looking suspicious
asking for cops to raid it
thats the portrait thats painted
the little kids see my whip and tell me I made it
I aint made shit
we aint quite go from slaveships to spaceships
we came from the earths core
now we in the basements
but what makes summertime so special
the sun puts in longer hours
lighting up ya next move
your longer chain sway
In accordance to ya chest moves
from breathing
and now what was scheming is called a chess move
plot one
remenisce to show yourself your not done
dont be down on ya life
be happy cause you got one
Its summertime baby
beer bottles barbeques
09 new music
for digging like garden tools
sticking to ya soul like barnicles
the nightmusic family tree
releasing his particles
as imakemadbeats and au
heart n brain and greymatter
thats what they'll be putting on they nephews too
Ill have my cousin bumpin madvillain
watching us get bent
cracking jokes just chillin
hollin at bitches to have the nerve to fuck with em
and thats how the cycle starts again
Its summertime</pre>
