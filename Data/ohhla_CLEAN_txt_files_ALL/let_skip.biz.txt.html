Yeah, yeah

I'm ripped, I'm on a acid trip
My DJ's in a coma for lettin' the record skip
Lettin' the record skip
Lettin' the record skip
Lettin' the record skip

Wow, shit, son of a bitch
Say shit, three times in a row like I don't give a shit
Goddammit son of an ass
Ladies and gentlemen, Bizarre's a dumbass

Sayin' cuss words like Too $hort
Eatin' pork of all sorts in the middle of New York
Beatin' my meat, watchin' Sesame Street
Fuck the sheet, I'll bust on my little niece

She's so sweet, a six-year-old freak
Want me to bust right between her ass cheeks
You ever met a guy with Cancer who refused Chemo?
Callin' the doctor a hobo and doin' a two-week promo

That's me, a fuckin' G
I'll probably be dead before the end of this CD
And VD, I probably caught it
Crack in your neighborhood? I probably brought it

I'm ripped, I'm on a acid trip
My DJ's in a coma for lettin' the record skip
Lettin' the record skip
Lettin' the record skip
Lettin' the record skip

I'm ripped, I'm on a acid trip
My DJ's in a coma for lettin' the record skip
Lettin' the record skip
Lettin' the record skip
Lettin' the record skip

Yeah when this Hennessey get into me
Man, I talk shit until I lose my mind like Kennedy
The bottom line, I ain't feelin' yo ass
So when the pump's in your car, it ain't to fill it with gas

Nigga, it's Young Miles, I'm the boss of the crime
You don't know another nigga that's as hard as I
I clap a nigga in his ride then I toss the nine
I'm at your weight with a bomb, now your coffin flyin'

You tryna say I ain't the best of this rappin'
Man, you got it fucked up like sex in heaven
And I can gun you down, I don't fuck around
I'll have you sleepin' up underground

So when your boy lend a man a pipe
Bitch niggas better run like they scared for they life
And when I pop the thing
Even the niggas in the crowd catch shots like a hockey game

I'm ripped, I'm on a acid trip
My DJ's in a coma for lettin' the record skip
Lettin' the record skip
Lettin' the record skip
Lettin' the record skip

I'm a grown ass man that's an obsessed Usher fan
[???] rub his back and put on his headband
[???], still workin' at Wendy's
Sniffin' dope, with my girlfriend Kimmy

Fuck a cup, I'll piss in your butt
Tell my grandfather to shut the fuck up, while I piss in his butt
Can't be around kids, my brain will splatter
I ain't readin' books, I'm pullin' on Pampers

'Cause I don't give a shit, fuckin' a bitch, 86
[He just told you he don't give a shit"]
Grandmother 86, my grandfather would nut in his butt
I'm a goddamn nut</pre>
