Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Yea, I just hope that I'm alive for it
Sacrificed everything up for livin' sky born
Crossed my heart to only die for it, yea
Feel like it's comin', I just hope that I'm alive for it
Sing junior (la la la)
Sing for the world (la la la)
Sing for the people (la la la)
Yea (la la la)

Globe trottin', me and Nina ain't stoppin'
Eye poppin', stage antics for your eye sockets
Antibiotics are so toxic
I take 'em so I can still keep the people's head ubnoggin'
Christian must have gathered, baby how you've been?
From here to Iraq and back, that's how we live
Eatin' in gas stations, fast foods, that's how it goes
Months got us surpassing, every hood says your casket's closed
Okay, and if you missed us, we've been right under your nose
We on for Christmas, be in right back of the road
It's been a great blessing the lesson of sorts
They thing I lose, choose to go to the best schools that I can afford
Been a long way since drivin' sis for it, drivin' this back and forth
And already meet one with war, they say your people look poor
(Okay) Get my head in the holy water
Pray the Holy Father forgive me for wrongs and just let me live a lil bit longer

Yea, I just hope that I'm alive for it
Sacrificed everything up for livin' sky born
Crossed my heart to only die for it, yea
Feel like it's comin', I just hope that I'm alive for it
Sing junior (la la la)
Yea (la la la)
Sing for the people (la la la)
Yea (la la la)

Don't think it's comin' nigga, especially not the way I wanted
How it's supposed to be you told to me so I'm still on it
Ain't no frontin' it, no stuntin' man, I came from nothin'
A block nigga, everything I'm worth came from hustlin'
This rap shit full of tricks, ain't no bruise in it
Flip a switch, back to itch and I can't lose with it
I dump that bow wow get them bow wow's on my food with it
Play me 5 pou' I go pou pou, let me jew bit it
I read these blogger sites where rocker tights been pockin' trife
They can hear my life and what I write when I bless a mike
If they ain't feelin' what the villain spillin' fuck a man
That's what I'm spillin' to my kin and then come back again
Never win, never wheel, never end in battle
It's like I'm tryna push a heard of sheep that's really cattle
I'm so rattled in the saddle, it's a bumpy ride
It wouldn't matter if I died or if I stayed alive

Yea, I just hope that I'm alive for it
Sacrificed everything up for livin' sky born
Crossed my heart to only die for it, yea
Feel like it's comin', I just hope that I'm alive for it
Sing junior (la la la)
Sing for the world (la la la)
Sing for the people (la la la)
Yea (la la la)
