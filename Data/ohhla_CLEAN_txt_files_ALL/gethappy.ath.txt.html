[Intro]
"PUNCH THE KEYS FOR GOD'S SAKE!"

[Atherton]
Cardiac arrest thirty second flat line 
Now I'm back from the dead using up my cat lives {*MEOW*}
Every kitten I ever owned died within a year
I guess sucked up their luck and stuffed it in here
You could put a musket to my ear and bust it
at point blank range and I wouldn't even budge kid
Not in my budget to die any day soon
Can't afford time for sleep, his cousin or you ("YES!")
Got too much to sort through, errands to run
before credits roll walking into setting sun
So I get it done in daylight push the product at dusk
2 AM you see parts of my carcass start to rust
TRUST - I make the wear and tear look lovely
I could buff Ted Buddy into cute and cuddly
And if, that isn't somethin then you know nothin
Yo, don't touch me til you've grown up youngling
'til you've owned up to stuffing your face with fallacy
cold cut puppet strings while walking across this balance beam
Hope you slip on the drip off that caramel
from those candy coated dreams that got you feeling very well
dapper and dandy, but it's all false
Not seeing the forest through the trees is your fault
your vault empty I'm sorry Geraldo
Search less satisfying than finding "Where's Waldo"
Although, you're a self declared righteous brother
Can't see how you speak peace 'til examining the other
as in the opposite, pocket lint, rotten shit
No pot to piss in so you slit your esophagus
and watch it drip on blank canvas like Pollock did
As you bang your head again on the solid brick
Alcoholic, binge popping pills of abolishment
All your wits call it quits its its its its

[pre chorus]
It is, only then, that you, begin to
It is, only then, that you, begin to

[CHORUS: repeat 2X]
It's only then you begin to realize 
fact of the matter is get happy or die
It's only then it begins to make sense
the meaning of life, get happy or get dead

[scratching]
{*"One is for the beat, and the two is for the rhyme"*}
{*"Get your shit together, you're runnin out of time"*}
{*"One is for the beat, and the two is for the rhyme"*}
{*"Three is for the life - now we on this incline"*}
{*"One is for the beat, and the two is for the rhyme"*}
{*"Get your shit together, you're runnin out of time"*}
{*"One is for the beat, and the two is for the rhyme"*}
{*"Three is for the life - now we"*} HOPE THAT YOU DIE
ha ha ah - or, you know, find true happiness
That's, that's okay too - even better in fact
Happy... happiness, happy happiness
OR GET DEAD~!</pre>
