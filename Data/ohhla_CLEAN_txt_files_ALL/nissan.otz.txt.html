[Chorus]
Nissan, Honda, Chevy, Nissan, Honda, Chevy, Nissan, Honda, Chevy
My stash is never empty baby
Nissan, Honda, Chevy, Nissan, Honda, Chevy, Nissan, Honda, Chevy
The-the D's will never get me

[Verse One]
In my hoopty I be swurvin, the public who I'm servin
Boost phones forever chirpin I be out there puttin work in
Know them dirty boys lurkin If they nab me then it's curtains
So when I'll go see a person I spend the blocks so I'm certain
That it's cool, I'm no fool, see Raul is bored and reckless
So I meet him when it's busy at that Meek or Morgan exit
Off that BQ B-B-B-B-B-B-BQE near Mickey D's
And occasionally treat myself to a nice little fish and cheese
I'm really really in the street, being broke's my enemy
Teachers said I'm dumb but I dropped out and I know chemistry
I make that soft get hard, and meet my homey Pito
In the parkin lot of Home Depot off Northen Boulevard
I got my route down packed, I'm about my stacks
And my mouth don't chat I let my 'bout 'bout clap
But I ain't with that though I'm tryin to get that dough
Beamer, Benz or Bentley oh no I stay low in that

[Chorus]
Nissan, Honda, Chevy, Nissan, Honda, Chevy, Nissan, Honda, Chevy
My stash is never empty baby
Nissan, Honda, Chevy, Nissan, Honda, Chevy, Nissan, Honda, Chevy
The-the D's will never get me</pre>
