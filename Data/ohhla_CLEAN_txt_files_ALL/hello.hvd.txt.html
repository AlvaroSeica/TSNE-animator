Would you like it if I know your name?
Know your name, eyy, hey heyy..
Would you like it if I knew your name?

Ain't you tired of playin those games?
Silly games, silly games, games, gaaames
How's about a little dinner and drinks

Silly games, games, gaaames
Tired of, tired of tired of..
Playin those games, silly games
Games, gaaaames

Bye, my love...</pre>
