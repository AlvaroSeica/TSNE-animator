Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro]
Hip hop to the fullest
Hip hop to the fullest
Hip hop to the fullest
Hip hop, let's go

[Bridge]
The most beautifullest, the most beautifullest
The most beautifullest thing in this
The most beautifullest, the most beautifullest
The most beautifullest thing in this world is

[Verse 1]
They call me Frederico Capi, flowin is my hobby
Still move low, they think I'm still up in the lobby
I had to leave that edition, papi
I murder ink, I never let y'all rule, Gotti
I'm at the knick game, stop it
Jeremy lynn, they trying assault from a raquet
I'm in the Bronx like Robinson canoe
Kill you spurr in a moment, they were robinson canoe
And they know I get benjamins more
Candy paint by Benjamin Moore
Now my sugar high flow I went out
We can bring them lamas ball
I do is draw guns, we call that art of war
Now homie, what you doing?
Gas spit tall as patrick, look what you in
I'm used to this thing, and I get busy for real
It's a beautiful thing, Fred!

[Chorus: x2]
The most beautifullest, the most beautifullest
The most beautifullest, the most beautifullest
When you rappin hip hop to the fullest
And your lyrics is a weapon
And they love it when you pull it, Fred

[Verse 2]
Welcome to my bar, God spittin the word
Rookie of the year, Robert Griffin the 3rd
Once you say action, I'm in the play action
Or I could throw you these bullets and we can stay rappin
I see why girls find the attraction
Calling me TI, we on a mac tiny captain
You don't mind me aksing
Who do you listen the most to?
Are you a fan or is it someone that you close to?
But whatever, I'm a score what he'll forfeit
Sauna make a moron I'm insulted
Metaphors awkward, flowing sink, I never floss it
Get it, flowing sink, I never forfeit
Nobody rap hard as me
You ain't gotta know about cars to acknowledge me
I'm used to this things
See I get busy for real
It's a beautiful thing, Fred!

[Chorus: x2]
The most beautifullest, the most beautifullest
The most beautifullest, the most beautifullest
When you rappin hip hop to the fullest
And your lyrics is a weapon
And they love it when you pull it, Fred

[Outro]
Hip hop to the fullest
Hip hop to the fullest
Hip hop to the fullest
Hip hop, hip hop</pre>
