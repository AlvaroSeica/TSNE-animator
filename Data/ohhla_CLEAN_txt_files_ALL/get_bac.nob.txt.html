[Verse 1: Young Noble]
Win, lose, or draw
We ain't finished with yall
Bring the pressure down hard
Is you feeling it dawg
Outlawz muthafuckas spread coast to coast
You don't fuck with Young Nobe'
You suppose to know
Don't get mad when you flop
Like you suppose to flow
Don't get mad cause I fucked her
So check ya hoe
I neck the shows
Death to whoever approach
Matter fact we gettin' you
And whoever was close
Neva was broke
Just neva had enough
So Imma grind in the mud til my bank account flood
You wanna be a thug nigga?
Read a book!
We need more smart souljahs
We already crooks
We ain't gotta do shit
Cause yall already done it
One muthafuckin' album
That's all it took
We on a whole 'nutha level
They hatin the fact
You got a muthafuckin' melon I been waitin' to crack
I'm bringing it back
Thug shit to bang in the club
And you could feel it if you pimpin' nigga Crippin' or blood
I'm hearin' a buzz
Niggaz sayin' Nobe shit raw
WestSide, Outlaw
Til they ride out yall

[Chorus: EDI]
Oh Nobe is ya know Get Bac
Outlaw comin' thru Nigga it's a fact
One time for my Jerzey Mob
Where you at?
We ain't leavin' this bitch
Until we takin' a grip for Makaveli
If you feel 'em Get Bac
Hustlaz, Thugz in the place where the sratch
One time for my Cali Mob
Where you at?
We ain't leavin' this bitch
Until we takin' a grip for Makaveli

[Verse 2: EDI]
Hurry-Hurry get yo dough some mo'
EDI-i, I'm not a new jack
I own my throne
Thug walk -- slick talk
I fuck up ya dome
Get ahold of that dime piece
And fuck up ya home
Once again it's on
But naw I aint Cube
Imma a N-I- Double G - A, real true
Niggaz gettin' they ass kicked by grass flicks
That faggat fa real
Need to get his ass lynched
It's two-thousand now
It seems everybody 'bout they cash now
Well get cha shit and get it quick
Cause we comin' in abundance
If you want itI could give it to you
Fuckin' wit these niggaz
We gon' dick a bunch of bitches for ya
The rap game is great money
And bitches for ya
The dark side is hate
They don't want you gettin' richer
Stickin' to the plan
It sho' is payin' off
That crazy nigga'z busta gin
You niggaz fakin' dawg
It's a whole lotta yippin' and yappin'
Stick to the rappin'
Be smart let us do the click and the clappin'
It's a whole lotta yippin' and yappin'
Stick to the rappin'
Be smart let us do the click and the clappin'

[Chorus: EDI]

[Verse 3: Napoleon]
Nigga you don' stepped yo foot in some shit
You punk bitchI got war with you niggaz
But I ain't dyin' like this
If I run up on you cowards
And yo pockets look fat
I put my gat to yo ice
And Imma melt it like that
Street wise, nigga street survive
Throw on my life
War game is my game
And I'll prove it tonight
It the blocks like the cops
Make you punk niggaz drop
Napoleon, strength for the strong
With my hands on the glock
You shot what nigga? Hot what?
Nigga shut yo mouth!
Throw yo hands up and watch me knock you out
Got a lot to proveLot of shit to do
Lotta gunz to pop
And Imma pop 'em at you
We're the last niggaz of the real niggaz
One of the niggaz you can ply
Try all yo life but you ain't gon' deal nigga
And if you holdin' a grudge
You gettin' budged
You runnin' yo mouth
I'll put ya dick in the mud
Outlaw

[Chorus: EDI]</pre>
