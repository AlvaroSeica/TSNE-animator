[Verse One - Pressure]
I once had time on my hands, but now handling time
Is coping with this life cycle and the mandatory grind
My sanity's fine, just falling short of stamina I'm
Searching for some food for thought to feed this famine of mind
And when I'm stagnant I rhyme, it helps the night turn to day
I churn my way through this nine to five and urban decay
Believe me it's bleak, and though the city's breaths in its sleep
It's just a paddock, ain't no where a shepherds leading these sheep
Now most prefer it covered up lie than the truth naked
The truth is ugly like cellulite; please don't publicly parade it
I hate it but to escape it would be luck on fluke
I feel like I'm a dope beat but I'm stuck on loop
But that's my life cycle; freedom means everything to me
And face value's got us believing everything we see
So if our eyes tell us lies the truth is we're blind
So keep on walking straight and narrow down illusionary lines

[Verse Two - Pressure]
I once had respect for this game, but now this game of respect
Is sold to the highest bidder with some fame and a cheque
Now any layman can get respect without breaking his neck
Paying dues, time these crews started paying some debt
It ain't lights and cameras, personalities on set
Distorting realities in their context
With no originality concepts
Who gives a fuck about a salary; this ain't a popularity contest
Cos hip hop ain't faking for ends
Hip-hop ain't fading with trends
It ain't rich kids playing with pens
It ain't the clothes on your back, or the label on them
It's where you're at, so I say it again
It's just my life cycle; music means everything to me
It's just a fashion show, nah; don't believe everything you see
Cos if our eyes tell us lies the truth is we're blind
So keep on walking straight and narrow down illusionary lines

[Verse Three - Pressure]
That's just my life cycle, nothing matters but setting me free
Because my freedom and hip hop be meaning everything to me
Now face values and fashions empower everything we be
Believing everything we hear, and everything we see
So if our eyes tell us lies, then we usually find
Our visions cluttered by this scutter so the truth is we're blind
It's just poison food for thought for these dillusionary minds
So stop walking straight and narrow down illusionary</pre>
