[J-Ro]
I knock 'em knock 'em out the park when other rappers are hitting bunts
I'm a togger not a fogger step on runts and don't do stunts
I got SOUL POWER never took a cold shower
Now I got twenty hos the color of cooking flour
You can call me sleazy cuz my rhymes are kinda greasy
I used to have a curl now eveybody wanna tease me
Like a Kung-Fu flick, I stick you in the dick, with my toothpick
Tell 'em Homicide (DJ Homicide: You hit them like a brick)
I like clothes and hoes but like 'em better in the sheets
I rock more beats than Jesse Owens ran track meets
Amazing feets move, they happen everyday
When the Ro to the J bring his ass out to play
I weight one-ninety but I'm, fat
I ki-uh-kick up dust when I bust like a cap
Tha lik-lik? crew, and Sugar Ray too
Is rock a show, knock a hoe, and crack another brew
Make Room

[Chorus: Mark Mcgrath of Sugar Ray]
It's not cause I'm seein' double
It's not cause we're causin' trouble
It's not cause you're in a bubble
Now, can you just (Kiks: Make Room!)
It's not cause I'm seein' double
It's not cause we're causin' trouble
It's not cause you're in a bubble
Now

[DJ Homicide of Sugar Ray]
It's the super, producer gets it poppin with the quickness
Homicide and the Alkies straight gettin down to business
It's all about the Liks cause they heavy on the kicks
But they easy on the treble (adjust my scratch level)
So fools can here my beats bangin' all the way in China
The skills you can't front on, Tha Homicidal rhymer
Could rip a show up to' up (???) til the crips and bloods show up
and rock these turntables til the motherfuckers blow up
But that's cause I'm slick tossin records like a discus
Y'all niggaz feel these beats from fuckin' Halloween to Christmas
That's why I'm screamin on all y'all niggaz like the Sonics
I'm hooked on gin and chronic like your momma's Hooked on Phonics

[E-Swift]
So when we steppin through, with the thirty-two of brew
You better make way for the Alkaholik crew
When we steppin through, with the thirty-two of brew
You better make way for Sugar Ray, fool!
Make Room!

[Chorus]

[J-Ro]
J-Mcenroe, I'm smackin' foes
You seen that movie "Heat"? My crew was packin' those
You lackin' flows, you come off wack in shows
You (pickin' chickens???) man we got models and actin hoes
Guess who's back down at the brew shack
Gotta cool sack of that shit to blow your dude back
Who wack? I'll beat you till ya blue, black
And make you do crack in the back of a new 'lac

What's my name? (J-Ro)
You tell them how to spell it (J-R-O)
Now you know niggy
Rest in peace (unintelligible syllable) Tupac, Eazy
Pun, and Biggie
It's time to get drinky(?)
Break out'cha bong while I sing my song
Hope it's bomb cause I'm gonna sing it all night long

[E-Swift]
When we steppin through, with the thirty-two of brew
You better make way for the Alkaholik crew
Make room!

[Chorus] w/ J-Ro, over "make rooms and "now"
It's the Liks baby, Sugar Ray baby
It's the Liks baby, Sugar Ray baby
Bein' drunk!

Rhymin' the Rhyme (echoed four times, beat changes)

[Tash]
Night vision, with precision, we slay with no delay
It's the Liks and Sugar Ray so feel free to fly away
'Cause the "A" in "Alkaholiks" stands for "Always been the shit" (Word)
You can catch me in the wobble slam-dancin' in the pit
Look (the way?) my homies get when we out that alcohol
we do it all, start a brawl, tell the cops (fuck y'all)
Carl Lewis feet ain't as swift as my pen
that's why y'all niggaz keep knockin' but you can't come in
Look at where the fuck we been, around the world in a day
That's why the fools can't fuck with the Liks and Sugar Ray
