[Chorus 2X: Vic Mensa]
When I get down on my luck I hide behind my eyes in Hollywood
They say ain't what you know but who you know you need to know someone to know no one
When I get down on my luck I roll one up and roll around all by my lonesome
Lost some years, I used to know; I know my fate like bullets in a shotgun

[Vic Mensa]
She loves to dream livin' in and off and out her mind in space and time
She takes a line and lies her life away you might just say she stays to go nowhere
Midnight scenes from an old romantic movie usually you'd be there
Today I say was different; I can take you with me wanderin', if you wanna go there

[Interlude: Vic Mensa]
Down on my luck...
Down on my luck...
Do you think about the things you say you don't?  Uh, I know you do
Uh, white wine she over cool - ooh look at you, look at you
Do you think the things you do or who you know? Uh, cause they told you to
And, why you listen to 'em? Hands up, middle finger to 'em... {*echoes*}
Fuck that, get down

{*instrumental plays on for 16 seconds*}

[Chorus] - 1X

[Vic Mensa]
When I get down on my luck...
When I get down on my luck...
When I get down on my luck...
When I get down on my luck...
