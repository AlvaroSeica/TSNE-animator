[Intro]
Yeah, Gray Poupon, the remix!
You thought I hit y'all right the first time?
Got much more in the stash

[Chorus: scratched 2X]
"Things are done different in my zip code"
"If you think I'm joking you're sadly mistaken"
"You wanna rumble? Well you can get crumbled"
"Today will be the grand opening of your chest"

[over second Chorus repeat]
I go by the name of Doap Nixon
You already know that

[Doap Nixon]
Yo we done told you that we out on the frontline
Now the money's comin, niggaz eatin like lunchtime
Pazmania, Reef the Tazmanian
Nickelbag niggaz ain't know I'm half-Ukrainian
They slept on "Sour Diesel" like retards
But this one's the second comin of Esau
Ain't got to tell you 'bout the hoods that I'm runnin at
But come with that shit, get your wig piece mummy wrapped
The backyard's where the money's at
You have to have to tell your friend's mom her son ain't comin back
That's that shit that I'm talkin about
You tryin to make it out the hood, ain't nobody tryin to walk it out
It's grand opening, everybody's smokin and
my Cali niggaz loc'n'n, thorough niggaz focusin
And I ain't in this for the brizzles my nig
But anybody wanna beef I'm pistol whippin they kids

[Chorus]

[Celph Titled]
When the beef heat up, it'll pop the meat thermometer
Head on collision put your teeth full speed in the speedometer
The rapper rappers hate the most, my career blastin off
Cause I went underground platinum with "The Gatalog"
Four discs of torturer shit; and when I'm with
my Pharaoh counterparts you get hit with the poisonous whip
My brother Doap Nixon the flow's sickenin
We put a bow on an opponent's forehead cause the dork said he's so gifted
(Oh no he didn't!) Well yes I did
I'm wild like an orangutan mixed with a gangbangin Mexican
Shining like the aurora borealis is
Swung so many nunchucks with my thumb tucked my palm developed callouses
Armed with 40 calibres I will give you paralysis
We just set a date the bullet holes'll mark your calendars
Uhh, I'm just honest, so you can save your comments
Eat you for a cheap dinner like I just ate ramen

[Chorus]

[Reef the Lost Cauze]
Uhh~! Grand opening, grand closin
I box with metal gloves son, the hands golden
I pop whoever stand closest, I rock thousands across oceans
I'm refreshed and I'm focused
I'm the dopest, next to my brother Doap it's
O.P.G., hit you like a swarm of locusts
And we don't even deal with promoters
Just send us the deposit and tell us what time the do's it
I'm not apologetic 'bout how I said it
How powerful the set is, or the bar and how high I set it
It's how I get it laugh when they ask debit or credit
Then reach in my pocket proceed to peel lettuce
Let us, bow our heads and rejoice in the light
It's Lost Cauze the most powerful voice on the mic
And that's not for discussion, don't be makin assumptions
That's when I Steve Young 'em
Eight straight to the stomach you bitch!!

[Chorus]

[Planetary]
Severe rap, fear that, Philly bring the beards back
Trigger like a fish make a nigga change the beer tap
+Grand Opening+ ready for that biznap
Streets full of blood, you ain't lettin your kids out
I make a rapper wig out from the lyrics
They can't see me I'm a spirit; born to be fearless
I'm a promoter of colder days, shoot like a soldier blade
Throw a fit quick, probably break your fuckin shoulder blades
It's only right I spit this verse on a cold night
Came to bring the flame and burn your rep for your whole life
(It's over~!) I'm so nice competition is dead weight
A head case can't get my fuckin head straight
My shit spit critical like a fed case
Crazy, got you niggaz huffin that led base
Massive meltdown, bring the red tape
Pharaoh Clique, rap keepin my breath great

[Chorus]

[Vinnie Paz]
You sleepin with the enemy that's who you in bed with
I'll put your brain matter back to the edge of the desert
Y'all ain't never 'gwan win, you just a contestant
The 40 .cal dumb loud and bust your intestines
HAHAHAHAHA~! You see it's cold on the dark streets
You a corner store rapper, I'm an artiste
We Official Pistol Gang and we all beasts
I love blood, I don't cook, it's a raw feast
HAHAHAHAHA~! But y'all know how that go
Boricuas, morenos, told me that I'm a natural
So I walked in the booth and went whacko
Murdered anybody that ever wanted to battle
I love bitches but they get on my nerves
That's the reason that I send 'em OT for the birds
They can take the L for me or I beat 'em with words
You can catch me chillin on the balc' and see what to serve
Yeah

[Chorus]

[Chorus] - repeat with ad libs to fade</pre>
