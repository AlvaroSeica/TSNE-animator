If you hear any noise
It's just Jay and the boys
Hit me
Hit me again

[ VERSE 1: Kool Rock Jay ]
I gave a dollar, so I expect some change
Keep the bass, got a little mid-range
( ? ) as rap gets better
Tryina stack dollars doin what's clever
Record after record and show after show
Checks I collect in a steady flow
Lionel Bea chillin in the back of the Benz
And countin the ends and talkin to friends
Bookin dates and all that shit
No dough, no show, and that's legit
Tryina make the records and make them hit
But see you're all on the tip and you need to quit
Now you know the truth about a dope MC
Cause Kool Rock's discussed over coffee and tea
I'm makin the cash and makin it last and makin it fast
So just kiss my...

[ VERSE 2: Kool Rock Jay ]
Kick back and relax as I chill to the max
And come fresher than the rest on 24 tracks
Because I rock, shock, hip-hop and get to it
Some fellas get jealous, cause they can't do it
Slice rock the scratch as I kick some flavor
And Nate rush the girl with the best behavior
Don't lose a step, you better keep up the pace
If the beat ain't kickin, then pump the bass
Rhyme after rhyme and chapter after chapter
Serve a suck sap as fast as I have to
Facts they can't face it, rhymes they can't place it
Wrote it down in ink so they couldn't erase it
My neighborhood was torn, black knowledge scorned
It still didn't stop me, word is bond
Because I'm dope as hell, I'm servin 'em well
I'm livin XL if you couldn't tell

[ VERSE 3: Kool Rock Jay ]
Why do you take everything I mention?
What is this, boy, some type of press convention?
Changin rapidly, systematically
Song after song, versatile it has to be
Kool Rock Jay from around the way
Sayin, "Hip-hey-hey and a very good day"
I'm from the Oakland town, 21 years down
With a soulful sound got you all spellbound
No problems, I leave 'em all behind me
The best ( ? ) in the 1990s
The K the o the o the l, the R-o-c and the k
And the last is Jay
Kickin it, while Chip be mixin it
If it ain't workin, I'm all about fixin it
And if you're frontin you better kill that noise
You know why? Cause it's Jay and the boys</pre>
