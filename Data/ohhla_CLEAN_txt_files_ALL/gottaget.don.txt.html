[ HOOK 2x ]
Nothin but the money moves me
I got million dollar dreams, I'ma do me
I came from nothin, now my money talks
And believe I won't stop until I got it all

[ VERSE 1 ]
I'm gettin it, g-g-gettin it
You see how I be flippin it, European-whippin it
Everytime you see my whip, Don P's dippin it
Iced-out timepiece, wrist just glistenin
Chain so def, it got me not listenin
To anything a hater say, I just keep it pimpin, man
I just keep it movin cause there's money to be made
Moves to be ride, honeys to be slayed
You should keep your distance if we're on a different page
Give a damn 'bout what you say, bitch, I'm tryina get paid
Gucci on my feet, Navigator wood grain
Get all up in her brain cause I serve that good game
Good game yeah I serve it, got these suckers nervous
Clowns wanna play, I turn your block into a circus
Lions, tigers and bears, you better be scared
I'm comin for my bread or I'm comin for your head
I gotta get it

[ HOOK 2x ]

[ VERSE 2 ]
They hatin, I'm ballin
I ain't trippin cause the hoes keep callin
They losin, I'm winnin
Pockets gettin fat, rims keep spinnin
Blow a lotta swisher sweets, gotta keep kush in it
Mob music for the streets, gotta keep pushin it
The coast, keep reppin it, flows indefinite
Am I definitely dope? Most definite
Rock it up from soft to hard, I be iron-chefin it
Gone till November, baby, I be Wyclefin it
Comin back with so much paper, you'd think I was pressin it
Make a good impression, my expressions is impressionate
The best is what I'm dressin in, Dolce Gabana scents
If it don't make dollars, it don't really make much sense
Ain't talkin 'bout no fetti, then fella, you speakin French
And nah, I ain't conceited, lil mama, I'm just convinced
I gotta get it

[ HOOK 2x ]

[ VERSE 3 ]
I gotta get it, I gotta get it
I'm all about my money, man, I talk it cause I live it
I gotta have it, I gotta have it
When it comes to that paper Don P like a addict
Million dollar mouthpiece, million dollar grind
Million dollar hustle, million dollar shine
Try to make a lotta paper in a little bit of time
So I can pop champagne while shorty wiggle her behind
I'm gettin mine, you hatin, that's fine
Don't get out of line, trick, cause you could eat the nine
Hammer's on mine, any moment's Hammer Time
Straight shots of Tequila, then hit it with the lime
Shorty's hotter than a fever, not a nine, she's a dime
A bonafide diva, the five star kind
Man, I ain't gon lie, I really wouldn't mind
What's good lil mama, put a nigga online
