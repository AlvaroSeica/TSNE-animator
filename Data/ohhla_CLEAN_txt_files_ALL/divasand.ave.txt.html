[Intro]
Uh huh! Yeah! 

[Chorus] 
It's too many divas, and not enough dimes
If it ain't about money, then I ain't got time
Even though I got a Rollie and Chapar  with the fish
Fuck these hoes I'm goin hard with the bricks

[Verse One]
Man it's one in the head and sixteen in the clip (Blaow Blaow!)
You fuck with my bread you gettin seen nigga rip (R.I.P.)
Hands to the sky niggas know how I give it up (On the low)
Coke I supply bought the Benz and big truck (Toy cars)
Tryin to get a crib in the name of my bitch
Had thirty percent cash but her credit wasn't shit (Damn girl!)
She ain't helpin if she hurtin, had to leave her alone (Yo I'm out!)
Fuck Suny Mae! I don't need that loan
Left mom dukes crib and found my own spot
Switched cars switched phones the shit was so hot
I remember homie thought he was followed by the feds 
In an unmarked car about to pick up his kids
I'm like damn homie, who the fuck's a snitch?! (Who could it be?)
We sell weight to weightmen ain't none of them gettin hit
Paranoid thoughts runnin through my head 'bout crime
Tryin to figure what they know, certain shit I'm dyin
With a needle in my arm if I blow trial (I'm gone)
Life ain't fairand I was livin so foul (I'm wrong)
Ain't no raps and plus I had to know how
To get this coke and move it like a snow plow (PLOOOOWWWWW!!!)

[Chorus] 
It's too many divas, and not enough dimes
If it ain't about money, then I ain't got time
Even though I got a Rollie and Chapar with the fish
Fuck these hoes I'm goin hard with the bricks
It's too many divas, and not enough dimes
If it ain't about money, then I ain't got time
Even though I got a Rollie and Chapar with the fish
Fuck these hoes I'm goin hard with the bricks

[Verse Two]
Yeah... In times of peace, I'm prepared for war
Lookin at my time piece, I'm preparin for more
Got a Movado, Cartier and a Rolex
Might buy a Audemar, maybe the Hublot next
Everyday in the streets, they tellin me, "You gon' blow next"
Sellin yay in the streets to felons who don't use Bowflex
I gave a whole 'nother meaning of putting work out
Distribute the work evenly 'til my work's out
Some niggaz ain't built, really don't ever work out
Strong arm robberies turnin niggaz to church route
Now The Lord with him, God forbid the law get 'em
He gon' testify on the stand and bring us ALL with 'em
Damn, victimizers become the victim
Nigga, either way it ain't right!
It's like countin it with the baggie, you ain't weighin it right
Ain't no tryin to make a point once I say it ain't right!
I'm dealin pounds in perico, green and white bills for it
Bought more birds than Popeye's in that cookin bitch
Literally, through my whip, window here you go
Buyin the Rolls, time to roll, my Napo' get this dough
and your bread up, bitches get a head up
And I been gettin so much head, it's like a set-up
When niggaz get the drop, you get shot from the neck up
Fuckin around with dots so your knot's gon' be separate, motherfucker!

[Chorus] 
It's too many divas, and not enough dimes
If it ain't about money, then I ain't got time
Even though I got a rollie and she par with the fish
Fuck these hoes I'm goin hard with the bricks
It's too many divas, and not enough dimes
If it ain't about money, then I ain't got time
Even though I got a rollie and she par with the fish
Fuck these hoes I'm goin hard with the bricks</pre>
