[Intro]
Let me talk about it, listen

[Bridge]
Living in the city where play is balling
Nobody follows the rules
I'm about that life, my money talk
And I ain't tryina play the fool

[Verse 1]
These bitches saying I'm their daddy, they say I'm so real
Get on your knees, oh now, which one I should kill?
She giving me deep throat,
She a panther, I'm Huey Newton in a pea coat
Cologne by YSL
Hold your breath, baby, YXL
You got a friend, bring mommy with you
Take off your bra, let me play with your chest like Bobby Fischer
Peach Ciroc, I made the mix,
She in the groove, I'm smooth as Luther in '86
Speaking of, I'm talking here and now
If you turn on the radio, you'd probably hear me now
I told your girl she got a good man
But right now I'm on stage, she in good hands
See that pussy? They hand it to me
I got no game, just some bitches understand my story

[Bridge]
Living in the city where play is balling
Nobody follows the rules
I'm about that life, my money talk
And I ain't tryina play the fool

[Chorus]
I ain't trying to hit nobody
I just wanna have some fun
Just for the glow and this sexy shorty
Tripping ain't easy where I'm from

[Verse 2]
I fuck with dimes all night, your bitch is just a Q6
Come and get her, I'm Audi like a Q6
Hear the acoustic?
They tryina go in my pockets like two balls and a pool stick
I might pay for her phone bill
But with the tax return she buying me some chrome wheels
That love for Frederico permanent
And her hair so soft she got a permanent
I'm like a '90 chubby guy in a buggy yacht
She refuse to confuse me with them other guys
I get it, it's my tone and my aura
And when she with a man, she can't wait for me to call her
With my daughter I play pick-a-boo
When I want a bitch I hit the club and I pick a boo
See that pussy, they hand it to me
I got no game, just some bitches understand my story

[Bridge]
Living in the city where play is balling
Nobody follows the rules
I'm about that life, my money talk
And I ain't tryina play the fool

[Chorus]
I ain't trying to hit nobody
I just wanna have some fun
Just for the glow and this sexy shorty
Tripping ain't easy where I'm from

[Bridge]
Living in the city where play is balling
Nobody follows the rules
I'm about that life, my money talk
And I ain't tryina play the fool</pre>
