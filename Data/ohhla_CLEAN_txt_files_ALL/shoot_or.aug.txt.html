Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
I'll be on that shoot or die shit, die shit
I'll be on that shoot or die shit, die shit
Let me show you how we bang
Let me show you how we bang
I'll be on that shoot or die shit, die shit
I'll be on that shoot or die shit, die shit
Let me show you how we bang
Let me show you how we bang

Y'all niggas got me fucked up
Thinking I'm a soft ass,
"Let me sing a love song to you" ass nigga
But I'm doing what I gotta do tryina get paid
If you try me you can die nigga
And I ain't gotta call nobody, I roll up solo
War that, put you on the floor
And if you ain't heard, better ask somebody
Before I let your ass know

I came up in the 504 where the block stay hot
And the hot boys all tote Glocks
Before a nigga had a shot in the game
I was there tryin to serve them rocks
See money ain't come where I come from
So I had to learn real fast, how I was gonna get it
Cause all I had was a voice and a dream
But if niggas tryina bang I'm with it

[Chorus: x2]
I'll be on that shoot or die shit, die shit
I'll be on that shoot or die shit, die shit
Let me show you how we bang
Let me show you how we bang
I'll be on that shoot or die shit, die shit
I'll be on that shoot or die shit, die shit
Let me show you how we bang
Let me show you how we bang

I was feeling like damn do the clip really hold 16 (And they know?)
And he be like August do you really smoke green
And the shit pop off when you bust that thang
Really talk, you ain't never gonna meet a motherfucker like me
A pretty motherfucker like me
In the words of asap
Niggas act wrong, I'm a dead'em asap
Now we really got a fuckin problem
I be with them killers in the street,
Kc to the east, got the heat I can fuckin solve it
Cause all I got bet you want that
So once you got beef better grill it up
Cause I'm feeling like weezy
I don't wanna have to hit em up, hit em up

[Chorus: x2]
I'll be on that shoot or die shit, die shit
I'll be on that shoot or die shit, die shit
Let me show you how we bang
Let me show you how we bang
I'll be on that shoot or die shit, die shit
I'll be on that shoot or die shit, die shit
Let me show you how we bang
Let me show you how we bang</pre>
