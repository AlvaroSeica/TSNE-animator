Verse 1 (Corey)-
Now you been watching me and I been watching you
So I decided to just come and talk to you
Aint tryin' to run no game just wanna know your name
And by the smile that's on your face, I see you feel the same
So can I talk to you?
And maybe after school I can walk you home
If that's cool with you, and then later on
I call you on the phone, and then I make you mine
By singing you this little song

Chorus-
Hush lil' lady don't you cry
I can show you how to have a good time
Me and you playing after school
Out on the weekend
After skating we can be cool (x2)

Verse 2 (Lil' Reema)-
How yah know when I come through
Know me, I'm Lil' Reema I'm too fly
Kinda cute too that's right

Now you know how I do, when you see me in school
See I can't get wit' chu, cuz' you remind me of a boy I knew

Verse 3 (Corey)-
I can tell you're feeling me, and gurl it's plain to see
That you and me we got us a little chemistry
That's why I'm down to do everything you wanna do
Anything that you want I can give, give it to you
So what's it gonna be?
Is it gonna be you and me?
You gotta let me know, don't keep me hangin' on
Tell me what I gotta do, to get it through to you
I want you to be my baby so...

Chorus-
Hush lil' lady don't you cry
I can show you how to have a good time
Me and you playing after school
Out on the weekend
After skating we can be cool (x2)
