[Intro/Chorus]
Beautiful tats, all over my back
Makes me so proud, I'm gonna shout it out loud
I got another tat-TOOOOOOOOO, baby (Yeah...)
Another tat-TOOOOOOOOO, baby
(Nuh-nuh-nuh-'nother tattoo babe, nuh-'nother tattoo)

[Verse One]
No part of me's blank, I'm really ink obsessed (Yes)
It's like an art show the moment that I get undressed (Check it!)
At every job interview, they're just so impressed (Really?)
'Cause I got all my ex-wives' on my chest (Ha ha!)
Over here is Clay Aiken, there's a side of bacon (Huh!)
and a Minotaur pillow-fightin with Satan (Yes!)
Next to Hello Kitty and a zombie ice-skatin (Yea!)
Wait... -- It's Ronald Reagan

[Pre-Chorus]
I got these dragons, I got these dolphins
All inscribed on me indelibly ('delibly)
I've had bad reactions, bad infections (Yeah!)
Even Hepatitis C ('titis C)
My friends think that I need therapy (therapy)
Maybe some laser surgery (surgery)
for the flaming goat skull on my knee (knee)
Knee (Knee!) Knee (Heeeeey~!)

[Chorus]
Beautiful tats, all over my back (all over)
And I've got some space here on the side of my face here 
for another tat-TOOOOOOOOO, baby
(Nuh-nuh-nuh-'nother tattoo babe, nuh-'nother tattoo)
Another tat-TOOOOOOOOO, baby
(Nuh-nuh-nuh-'nother tattoo babe, nuh-'nother tattoo)
No, I'm not high (high), I'm really okay (okay)
I just love these scribbles (Haha!), that won't go away
I got another tat-TOOOOOOOOO, baby
(Nuh-nuh-nuh-'nother tattoo babe, nuh-'nother tattoo)
Another tat-TOOOOOOOOO, baby
(Nuh-nuh-nuh-'nother tattoo babe, nuh-'nother tattoo)
Yeaaaaah

[Verse Two]
Yes there were a few, I got from losin a bet (bet, bet, bet, bet...)
I misspelled a word or two, still there's nothing I regret ('gret, 'gret, 'gret, 'gret...)
My shopping trips are no sweat (sweat), there's never stuff I forget ('get)
Check out this rad Boba Fett, he's playing clarinet~!

[Chorus]
Beautiful tats, all over my back (all over)
And what the heck (Ha ha!), there's still room on my neck 
I'll get another tat-TOOOOOOOOO, baby
(Nuh-nuh-nuh-'nother tattoo babe, nuh-'nother tattoo)
Another tat-TOOOOOOOOO, baby
(Nuh-nuh-nuh-'nother tattoo babe, nuh-'nother tattoo)
I don't know why (why), but everyday (day)
Whenever folks see me, they just back away (Whoa!)
I got another tat-TOOOOOOOOO, baby
(Nuh-nuh-nuh-'nother tattoo babe, nuh-'nother tattoo)
Another tat-TOOOOOOOOO, baby
(Nuh-nuh-nuh-'nother tattoo babe, nuh-'nother tattoo)
Yeaaaaah

[Outro]
{*BZZT!*} YAHOW~!!
Dah.. Okay, right there by my elbow.. {*buzzing*}
Y'see? Yeah.. I got a couple square inches left {*continued buzzing*}
Uh, maybe a squid or a tarantula or, something
I dunno, surprise me..
{*BZZT!*} DAHOW~!! MOTHER- {*fades out*}</pre>
