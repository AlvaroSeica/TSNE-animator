[O.C.]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
We 'bout to take you on a bounce mission
Uhh, yeah, rock on the boards ha?
Uhh, yeah, rock on the boards ha? (Rock on the boards ha?)
Uhh, uh-huh, yeah
Uhh, uhh, let's keep it goin c'mon
Mmm, geah, ahh, uhh
Uhh, yeah, ahh, uhh
Yeah, mm, ahh, uh-huh
Yah..

Yo - I got your asses movin, I keep the joint jumpin
I'm always sayin somethin, y'all know I'm nice stop frontin
Man I'm overdue, O.C.'s a rare breed
And equivalent to a stampede of nasty
Dog I'm true and livin, better yet alive and kickin
I ain't goin nowhere, this dough got me finger-lickin
Leavin, good taste in my mouth, I'm lovin it yo
I'm bigger I'm better I'm iller than I was befo'
Prayin I fall face first if ever the day come
No time soon, I'll be around longer than rum
That's legendary status, like car shows and Jacob Jared's
Reoccurin like black expos - this be a marriage
The Kodiak sipper, is bronze zipper
What I provide, will bring the freak out your sister
It's my life, it's my world, it's my way
It's Wildlife, it's our time, a new day

[Chorus: O.C.]
Aiyyo, let's get it on and poppin, time for some new rules
It's summertime y'all, so put your minks up
Pull the big dogs out, wax 'em up good
Get your ice steamed cleaned, shine your links up

[O.C.]
Yo, you never know what's comin next from me, I do it, casually
Have fun with it, get dumb with it, run with it
Spit it nasty like, dog shit on the bottom of your boot
Or nasty like a kid with a mouth that's loose
The purest form of anything considered to be raw
Like porno chicks takin cum shots and sayin (more)
I'm wicked in ways you can't describe my persona
+Good Times+, treat it like the hips on Wilona
From New York to Arizona; from Las Vegas, Nevada
to San Fran' to them third world borders, I..
.. won't stop, won't hush
I'm like some good ass smoke that you just can't crush
No matter what, M-U-S-H, S-H-I-N-E I was designed to be
I'm what you call content, and even with a hundred mill' in the bank
If you owe me I want every red cent

[Chorus] - 2X

[O.C.]
Yo, y'all niggaz sleepin thought I couldn't do it like this
I see y'all peepin sayin this is some ol' tight shit
It's no, doubt in my mind shorties gon' like this
That's aight den, that's soundin right den
Y'all niggaz sleepin thought I couldn't do it like this
I see y'all peepin sayin this is some ol' tight shit
It's no, doubt in my mind shorties gon' like this
That's aight den, that's soundin right den

Aiyyo, I got the hook-up, my man cook-up
See I'm about to shake up the world, once and for all y'all
For all y'all, it's for all y'all, no strings attached to it
{*beat plays*} That's all you gotta do
It's a one shot deal for those keepin it real
Just keep it right, just party all night and not kill
(Aiyyo, aiiiiiiiiiiiyyyyyooooooooooo, aiyyyyyyyyoooooo)
Hahahaha, yo

[Chorus] - 2X</pre>
