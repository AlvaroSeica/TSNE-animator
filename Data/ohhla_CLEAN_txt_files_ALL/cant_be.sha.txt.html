[Verse 1]
I thought we had a "Love Jones" like Lorenz Tate and Nia Long
But I was quite wrong, it started out sweet and got spoiled
It's funny how this whole shit boiled down
I woulda never macked to you, if I knew, what I knew now
A straight witch with curvacious hips, the sex good attitute foul
I shoulda known then - but I seen something in your eyes
And the challenge of taming that ass had me open wide
My mans told me that I shouldn't sweat you
'Cause of the way that I met you, it was a conflict of interest
And you were nineteen, very inmature in the brain
And I was already past that stage; years ago
But I was walking through the course with a blindfold
Realistically should've known that you was just a scandalous hoe
Scheme on your daughter Mrs. Est√©e Lauder
See a very hot dish, I had to put in my order
And maybe I could get a belly full
I got pull like little kids on mom's sweater
But it all turned out to be a big fiasco indeed
Now she playing lots of games with my seed, what could it be?

[Chorus]
How can I say that I'm sorry
When I still got so much pain in my heart
Said I'd be there for you and you there for me
But my lovin' is what ripped us apart
Now we can't be together

[Verse 2]
Stressed out, most times brings my best out
Overdue on the rent 'bout to get kicked out
Hit the streets hard, tryin' to build up some scraps
Fell on my face hard, now I gotta start from scratch
I know I got it; make plans switch up moves
I'm a capricorn, never will you see me lose
I gotta bigger things on my mind than chicks and weed
The future of my seed and my team on my bean and it seems
I gotta work harder for mine
While niggaz get lucky and get on first time
Shine quick, die fast, not built to last
I'm first class, straight up y'all albums trash
Court dates got me screwfaced, drive me to drink
I gotta show up, or they gon' throw me straight in the clink
I wash my face in the sink, sit down to think
Flood the page with ink, imagine my daughter in all pink
High with my face to the sky, exhale the fumes
Eyes glassed on to a Marvin Gaye tune
And the friends that I thought was friends left me in the cold
Swim around in circles like I'm in a fish bowl

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
The realest chick I ever met stayed on set
When I was soaking wet and deep in debt
She was my warmth in the cold
My shelter in the storm, my rose in hell
The last verse to my greatest tale
And she held me down through the segment
Even though I went and got this other chick pregnant
She was the one I shoulda been faithful to, my faith's in you
Now it's us two as long as it lasts
The vision of my daughter's mom shattered like glass
'Cause I realized that wasn't love, that was just ass
How could it last - and moms told me it'd be days like this
All my love for my wife yo I'll seal with a kiss

[Chorus] 2x</pre>
