Thats the beat

Mics get hit from bullet flavor I spit
Change the clips and also leave this shit
I be high as fuck when these MCs come
But from dawn to dusk I man breaks 'em up
Like booyow whatcha do now
I can hear them freaks sayin mechow
From head to head
Dread to dread
Lead to lead
Spread to spread
Niggaz be trippin' when the indos gone
Niggaz be trippin' when they womans gone
Niggaz be trippin' when they moneys gone
Thats why I'm rapping on the microphone
Razor Sharp......Crack Raider

Time to build my juice back up
Like the curl of a banger in the Compton cuts
How many MCs do I have to kill
Before I get to the top of the hill
Camoflouge dodge and Pittsburg Black
Doing shows at Alamodes where the niggaz be at
We spending food stamps
Avoid them tramps
A van full of beat with the Kenwood amps
Focus like a camera keep your eyes on the birdie
Legit as I can get but I still roll dirty
Razor sharp....crack raider razor raider....sharp
Crack raider razor raider razor....sharp.....crack raider

A tiga like me can't hit the block
Sucka MCs are like microphone cops
Jumped in the game for the do or die
Hit the microphone stand and got Kentucky Fried
Recognize baby that'll go for broke
Livin in the City where its only on coke
Razor sharp....crack raider razor raider....sharp

Going about niiinneettyy
On the freeway choking
Ain't no mystery to the weed we smokin'
Andre Nickatina says show me some snaps
And Andre Nickatina will surely rap
I hate to be a whore but the World's a pimp
I'm trying to tell my niggaz man don't y'all simp
Coming like a Mack Truck miss me if ya foul skunk
Represent the blunt when you get tossed up
Microphone flow like the Caddy at Ritz
At 9AM man the contact hits
Cocaine beats in stereo thinkin every car behind man is 5-0
Keepin all my rhymes on a computer chip
The Sugarhill Gang got me doing this
Razor sharp....crack raider razor raider....sharp
Crack raider razor raider razor....sharp.....crack raider

Razor sharp....crack raider razor raider....sharp
Crack raider razor raider razor....sharp.....crack raider

Sharp
Sharp

Thats the beat
