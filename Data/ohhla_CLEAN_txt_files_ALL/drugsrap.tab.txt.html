[Talib Kweli]
Yea
S'what I'm talkin about
S-A-S, size ain't shit, never that
Strong Arm Steady, Talib Kweli
Yea

[Chorus: Talib Kweli - 2X]
Niggaz gettin caught in the trap
for the cash, it's the drugs basketball or the rap
theres more to us than that
We the shit consider the facts, after you analyze that
You know you best to fall back
Woah

[Verse: Talib Kweli]
Woah!
I'm dealin wit, nuttin but facts, when I spit it though
You niggaz superstitious don't step on the cracks or split the poem
Candle light, flickers so bright, I feel the wick can kick a sicka flow
and spill it like a liquor store, I spit the shit to make a cripple get up and dance
I spit the shit to make the average MC piss in his pants
I spit the shit to make a mothafucker call it a night
I spit the shit to see fuck wit C. Delores Tucker sex like
I take a sip from my creative well, in this game for a minute
I play this well to win it, ya go to africa like dave chappelle, you finished
Cause ya prehistoric raps is borin, the number of whack rappers soarin
like the percentages of teenagers who have abortions
these niggaz meak they lyrics weak, and they beats is corporate
they try snitchin on records their mouths is leakin ???
drippin 'em ova system than, chinese water torture
rippin a series of events, more unfortunate than lemony snicket

[Chorus - 2X]

[Planet Asia]
Yea
medalliance mind, bless the mic for the gods, teach the blind
plus get a piece of mine release ya minds for each design
baby food for thought, rappas not ?? for sport
you ?? pork eatin niggaz of sort
yo yous a fuckface, burnt out loser thats always up late
planet ais the revolutionary slash nut case
a witchcraft black magic, data load up computers
a spread the message wrote to you where when I show illusions
if all y'all niggaz is killas then how ya write ya records
how'd you find the time stop lyin ya minds infected
theres only a few, and I ain't sayin niggaz don't put it down from you town
I'm talkin bout you

snitchin on them cameras
planet ais, gold chain black bandanas low
steady gain click clack rang rang der dey go

[Chorus - 2X]

[Phil Da Agony]
Yea
Just a high skip and a jump
away from gettin everything that I could possibly want
and prostitutes front
get a 4 bar on the roster, scratch that
I'm talkin about a full roster of raps
monstas that rap, buzzed out ?? check the cadence of the frequency
uniquely, we strong arms strategically
easily I twist the ?? killa cali ??
back alleys burnin backwoods in danelis or
he probably wit kweli, out in BK
we make it easy for the djs, like instant replays
conversation by the buttons, I talk and touch sumpin
straight shots of the luey he flew me out to london
crunchin numbers flippin more dough, like siccisero
next thing you know we kissin ya hoe, wit out the mistletoe
strong arm steady, agony can ???, phil the rigglies
The big league niggaz is droppin indies
les go

[Chorus - 2X]

[Talib Kweli]
Talib kweli, right about now
dis what I'm feelin right about now
and I invite you all to check it out wit me
Lets go!

S'like

[2X]
niggaz gettin caught in the trap
For the cash it's the drugs basketball or the rap
theres more to us than that
We the shit consider the facts, after you analyze that
you know you best to fall back
Whoa</pre>
