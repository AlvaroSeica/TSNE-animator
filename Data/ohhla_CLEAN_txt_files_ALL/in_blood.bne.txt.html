[Intro: samples of Rick Ross]
"AK's, Calico's to 45's..."
"In my blood, all the killers on my momma's side..."
"So keep your shoes tied, it might be a homicide..."
"In my blood, all the killers on my momma's side..."
"In my blood, all the killers on my momma's side..."

[Bizzy Bone]
Hoodtails, strictly for my niggaz doin fed time
Dead time, lookin for Revelations, look in yo' mind
Hoodtails, wood tails, shake yo' stick
When you up in here misunderstood the holy grail man have no fear
This is the order of the mailman, Christ you'll never fail man
Logically, better watch what you go and what you don't understand
Sands of the hourglass, cameras when we shower fast
I'm clean as a whistle like bald head, and I smoke the class 
Open that, battlin who? Just keep it flowin
Emotions so close we knowin, give so precious stones keep goin
Dear psychos, get on the boat, when it's off of the rope
We finna approach a new continuum, shit, go ahead and let them know
Say uh-oh, the keys to the castle cost you a dime
Never ever tell a lie about mine, little Jesus fine
We shinin in the afterlife, what? You think I'm lyin?
When I come back near this Milky Way where NASA is blindin
As we keep the Sabbath holy, dear Lord, that is untouchable
That angel was so beautiful, gotta love him from a distance though
Quit it, oh shit, you know, this how we dip
We not worthy, only God can love you more than us, quit it

[Chorus: samples of Rick Ross]
"AK's, Calico's to 45's..."
"In my blood, all the killers on my momma's side"
"In my blood, all the killers on my momma's side"
"So keep your shoes tied, it might be a homicide..."
"In my blood, all the killers on my momma's side..."
"In my blood, all the killers on my momma's side..."

[Bizzy Bone]
The spitter with no adultery, battle me, we gon' save ya
On a manger, on a stranger, wanna tell 'em what it is
Righteousness the guide when you're writing to live
Ain't no pain, no lies, ain't no time for fear
Put a little gangster into Elohim's, story of ten virgins
Allah-u Akbar as I sing to the surgeon
In four winds, one excursion, sweat pourin out of the pourin porridge
And plus these Porsches, portions, of important extortion
Never that, keep cool, unarmed no back
And Lil' Lay is still flippin, carry the doubt, it might have been track
Stay strapped, shit, relax, I'm chillin and feelin that
With no words just love, up the mountain, the fountain's back
Countin stacks on my way, to the courtroom, what?
It's just dreams anyway, one love cuz and we buck
Thuggish Ruggish and rough, tough (nawww) and yes we humble
Turn the other cheek, stay meek in this royal rumble (royal rumble)

[Interlude: Bizzy Bone Â– repeat 2X]
Hoodtails, strictly for my niggaz doin fed time
Dead time, lookin for Revelations, look in yo' mind
Hoodtails, wood tails, shake yo' stick
When you up in here misunderstood the holy grail have no fear

[Chorus]

[Outro: Bizzy]
Yeah, hoodtails (hoodtails)
Wood tails, shake yo' stick (shake yo' stick nigga)
As I walked up to the serpent and he said "Suck my dick"
I looked at him like nigga this me nigga
Who the fuck you talkin to?</pre>
