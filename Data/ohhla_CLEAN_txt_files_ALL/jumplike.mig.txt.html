Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus: Rich The Kid]
Got the trap house like Jordan
Pull up in a brand new foreign
300 on the dash and I paid straight cash
Take off on you niggas Jeff Gordon
AP, it cost me 50
Model ho yeah she with me
Livin' life like I'm Diddy
In the Kitchen with Whitney
Got the trap house jumpin' like Jordan
Trap house jumpin' like Jordan
Got the trap house jumpin' like Jordan
Trap house jumpin' like Jordan
AP, it cost me 50
Model ho yeah she wit me
Living life like I'm Diddy
In the Kitchen with Whitney

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Trap house jumpin' like Jordan
J's in the hood, theyâre snortin'
Double cup, lean, Iâm pourin'
Yo' bitch whippin' in the early mornin'
Pulled up in the drop top Phantom
Niggas in the hood canât stand it
My whip game is so special
Iâm whippin' up the whole Grand Canyon
I got Molly, I got white, Marilyn Mason!
I went to the jeweler, cashed out on a new piece, now my diamonds dancin'
Yo bitch think I'm romantic, my coke card game is frantic
My whip game make you panic, my plug is Phil Jackson
Feeling like Mutombo, I got all these Kush bowls
Juggin' at the Texaco, you smoking on Reginald?
Trap game Elvis Presley, you canât impress me
Dark skinned ho can cook the dope, she look like Nestle

[Chorus: Rich The Kid]

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
Got the trap house jumpin' like Kobe
Cashed out, hundred K on a Rollie
You ain't one of me, nigga, don't talk to me, nigga
I'm a real ass nigga, you phony
In the kitchen whippin' up them babies
Make the Pyrex trap go crazy
Young nigga got money, young nigga got work
Young nigga got crack like the 80s
I'm winnin', I'm winnin', I'm Dunkin', I'm Dunkin'
I'm Jordan, you're not even Kobe
In the kitchen with a Pyrex pot
Where the whippin' in the pot too hot
Drinkin' lean, out the bottle
In the Aston Martin foreign with a model
Twenty racks on me, got tats on me
In the bed with six hoes like 2 x 3

[Chorus: Rich The Kid]

[Verse 3: Takeoff]
Iâm a free man, no Morgan!
That choppa, it take out you organs
I play with them keys, no organ!
Your bitch in my kitchen, she snorting
The lean, Iâm pouring, I'm snoring
Iâm making them plays in Delaware
Versace, Medusa my underwear
Who the fuck, nigga better have haircare
You don't trap on the block if you don't live there
The trap be jumpin', and bunkin'
The fiends they running, the money keep comin'
I'm kickin' hoes out like a punter
If I start shootin', turn to a track runner
I'm callin' up Rich, he bringin' the kids
Whippin' the babies all summer

[Chorus: Rich The Kid]</pre>
