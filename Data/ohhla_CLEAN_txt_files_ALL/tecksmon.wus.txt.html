[Myalansky]
I keyed Jamal, This kid up in the wheelchair
Wild soldier, On the prowl with the toaster
Club night, Ordering drinks
Flavor Coogi, Orange and peach
Approaching God sport'n a mink
We politic about this Florida move
Had dime bitches trans four way state
Mya throw'n em winks
A cold chill went down my spine
Know'n Jake's style is murder niggas
Straight Guerrilla, We kill killers
Conversation got deep, Post me a squad by his seat
Down the straight shots of scotch white preach
Prices sound good but sure enough
Knew sucker had me touched
Man the Dutch funny feeling in my gut
Keeping my composure, Told him
Make sure shit's official
Gave him some dap and said I'll hit you
With an up North accent he replied back
Lets get dough baby, Word, You's a live cat page me

[Chorus: Myalansky]
Tecks, Money &amp; Murder, Project niggas is hurt'n
Out to fix some dummy for certain
Nothing but white chalk and yellow tape
Don't get caught like fish on the hook, Nigga swallow bait
V-A, Miami, Or Chicago snakes
No one's promised tomorrow when it's dollar chase
Next slug's breathing, You insert em
Like Nat my name Turner, Tecks, Money &amp; Murder

[Joe Mafia]
Step up in the house like we own it
Bottles is pop'n behind the velvet rope, Polly'n watch'n
Cribs all throughout the U.S., Do it on the strength
Cop last road towns then boom, We on the next flight
No luggage, Fuck it, Touch down
Couple of pieces, Tees and fees just to add to the features
See what's pop'n in a hood near you, My rear view
Keep coppers on the radar, Dirty and still cool
Wrapping up packages five-thousand mile away
Got my culinary degree whip'n up Arm &amp; H
Check out my resume, How much confetti weigh
We stick in the bank, You gamble'n with heavy weights
Put that suitcase up your ass sideways
Bring the duffle bag we plot'n on the truck five ways
Cartel rings, El Savadory lean cuisine
Cal Myra H-K with the beams, Uhh

[Chorus]

[Myalansky]
You think about the proposition
And how we'd run without this spot in Richmond
With shit that they shot us with, Scared to use my two-way
Looking for Jamal's man
It's been a week since we linked at Pizzazz
7-5-7, 2-3, 6-5000
I'm not the type of cat you call coward
Even though son grimey, I still gotta dry my hands
Yo hello, Yeah this Myalan, God was on the move at noon
Said we'd meet up at the Casablanca
No doubt son, He know my ass drinker
God was at the bar already
As I walked through the doorway, Sip'n some Henny with Alize
Cheers, We knocked down the thug passions
Politic'n, How the bitches gone do the drug traffic
When you tryna bounce I'm bout hit the lab
So I can count this paper
But Jake's smile like a straight crook

[Chorus]</pre>
