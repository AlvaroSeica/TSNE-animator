[Chorus: Rubbabandz]
We can smoke some sticky icky, put it in the air, ooh wee
Pop some ecstasy and naked chick is next to me
Oxycotton, zanax bars, lorisette, morphene
Purgaset, sip and serve, even liquid codeine

[Rubbabandz]
I can hold my heater tight, I love it when the pussy tight
I love to run up in her when I'm rolling on the river, right
We can get it popping tonight, O.J. straight, no ice
Air Force One's tonight, I bet I touch every bitch in sight
We can get it popping over here, shorty, yeah, shorty
You can come and drop it like it's hot, over here, shorty
Make it clap, make it clap, do your thang, do your thang
Then bend over, spread 'em wide, let me see your pussy rain
I can lean, you can lean, everybody wanna lean
Triple stat, lean back, throw back, dope fiend

[Hook: Rubbabandz]
Get your roll
Get your roll
Get your roll
Get your roll

[Chorus]

[Hook]

[Rubbabandz]
Eyes low, blowing dro, crystal meth, hell no
Purple haze, strictly green, you can get your dirt and go
We don't smoke that round here, you can get your pounds here
Good green, purple hairs, let me put that in the air
Burn something, burn something, burn something, burn something
I can smoke, you can smoke, everybody wanna smoke
No sticks, no seeds, hurry up and roll the dough
I can lean, you can lean, everybody wanna lean
Triple stat, lean back, throw back, dope fiend

[Hook]

[Chorus]

[Rubbabandz]
I can lean, you can lean, everybody wanna lean
Triple stat, lean back, throw back, dope fiend
