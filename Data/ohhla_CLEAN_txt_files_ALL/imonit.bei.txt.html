Yup I'm on it
On it like a stripper pool
On it like a groovy on a pro
Pause

Flashing lights and cameras baby

Love way ya dancing
And I'm looking for a pretty girl baby I'm on it
I'm on it like I'm on heat jersey like my boy Lebron
Ladies wanna talk to a baller like Marion Shawn
Cause I'm on it like to-let on a res-airy-side
She's like boy you can not be real on must be a ma-ride
Everywhere we go from New York to LA
Many pretty girls Detroit to the bay
Love way ya dancing
And I'm looking for a pretty girl baby I'm on it

Ah!

Getting on a stage I'm on my city!

Digging at these hoes
Yup yup deuce
