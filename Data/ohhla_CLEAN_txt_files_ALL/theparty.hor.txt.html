They say you can't buy love right?
I just saw some guy outside
Reckons he's selling it for thirty bucks a piece
(Love is the drug!) But anyway

It's clock off time, and some friday night decadence is heaven scent
Now your working week worries are irrelevant
to the task at hand, of the master plan
of getting so far plastered you can hardly stand
Shit, I know it's gross
You'll still catch me at the bar with my glass steady getting comatose
And don't front, I'ma see you there too
as all the thoughts of staying sober disappear into the awkward small talk
It's crystal clear, even with the beer goggles
Is it half empty or half full when you've drunk the whole bottle? (which is it?)
It's no wonder, drunk girls make punch-drunk love confessions
Boys get drunk and throw punches
So let's just all get bent, watch it unravel
Maybe that'll break down the walls of make-up and dress sense
(What's your poison?) cause it ain't just booze these days
Shit, you can sniff, bong, smoke or munch your money away
Set your brain on fire chasing a chemical heaven
You look like shit but you never felt better
And shit, I hate dancing, more power to the wall flowers
But in nocturnal mode, it's the main attraction
So from the house parties looking like a scene from "Kids"
to driving green Mitsubishis down the Kings Cross strip
Pour out a little liquor on the street
for all the nights that you passed out without brushing your teeth

[Chorus]
We live the party life, so get drunk, take drugs
Make love, and we'll do it all again tomorrow night cause
Rain, hail or shine these are the days of our lives
Let's waste 'em away one day at a time
With that party life, so get drunk, take drugs
Make love, and we'll do it all again tomorrow night cause
Rain, hail or shine these are the days of our lives
Let's waste 'em away one day at a time

[Nick Lupi]
See it's clock off time but my work has just begun
Two days off from real life, we gon' touch the sun
Party like we don't trust the sun (ay Solo?)
Now let me show 'em how the fuck it's done
See where I'm from part of the weekend never dies, it just lays low
While we preoccupied with getting by but
When it arrives we all getting live
All heading to the same place, whatever you ride
We living for the now, not concerned with the future
Kidding ourselves like we're gonna slow down
But all this real life talk will only kill my buzz
So I put it to the back and slowly fill my cup
Cause I know reality, it can't be faced when I'm high
That's exactly why I got this bag of kush and some papers, let's ride
Escaping through them late nights, trekking it home
to the unpleasant glow of daylight
These kids are dancing down the fine line between trendy and junky
and when the music stops, it gets ugly
Chemical romance, slow dance with heaven
Shit, I don't like the drugs but they love me, trust me
Uh, pour me another, uh, maybe a couple more
So I can disconnect until all my troubles call
Remember all's fair in love and warfare
Oh yeah, this is for my whole team of midnight juggernauts

[Chorus]

[Solo] + (Nick Lupi)
It's like this city never sleeps, simply turns into a nightclub
where your love ain't as important as your money or your drugs
Here, try some, you only live once
But some of these people acting like they ship already sunk
(So, let's get it while we still forever young
 Before the sun sets on yesterday's buzz
 Before adolescence catches up with what's left of my lungs
 Left wondering how it ever begun)
In this world wide ashtray like any other Saturday
We got the social smokers in with the pack-a-days
(I stay hammered straight with no chaser
 Any other way, mate I wouldn't have it)
It's like what goes up (till gravity calls me
 back from cloud nine for the plunge)
"And I hate all my friends cause all my friends are taking drugs" - Suffa
But shit I'm guilty as charged (so who the fuck am I to judge?)

[Chorus]
