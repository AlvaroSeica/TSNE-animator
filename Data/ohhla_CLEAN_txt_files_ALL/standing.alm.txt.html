[Intro]
Yeah...respect....
Sometimes its given....(Yeah)
Sometimes you gotta earn it....(Yeah)
But when you can't earn it (what you gotta do?)
You gotta go &amp; take it..
You feel me kid

[Verse]
Pac fell off, fuck is y'all thinking?
Prezzy on my wrist &amp; this bich Abe Lincoln
Pardon me rah, but I'm still inside the kitchen
And they want me on the mound but a nigga done pitching
So yeah its all good but I forgot to mention
I'm fresh off parole, I wish they start trippin'
Blood niggas, crip niggas, everybody snitchin'
I'm Jordan in the game, so with the game I am finished
Shoutout to Ib &amp; my nigga Na
Realest nigga breathin' you could ask the homie Kwa
Everybody drink until the well runs dry
The try to cut my wings but a nigga still (Fly)
Oh yeah, they fucking with me now
They frown when you're winning but they smile when you're down
From this point on, I ain't fucking with them clowns
I'm standing on a yacht and I hope you niggas drown

[Chorus]

(Sample)
Yea man
If you niggas really....was who y'all said y'all were
I wouldn't been at that party by myself 
I wouldn't be at these award shows by myself
I wouldn't be standing alone tonight 
If you niggas really say who y'all are

[Verse]
Back up on my bullshit, 40 with the nozzle
Still in the club poppin' bottles with the models
Perc outside, with his foot up on the throttle
And the whole key thing is that's my motto
So yeah I'm on some new shit, trying to get this new dough
Benz outside, shit lookin' like Pluto
Everybody know I'm a boss like Hugo
And the all pink stones startin' look like (Nuvo)
Oh yeah, so now I'm on some different shit
Whole key thing is, I'm trying get my difference
All black everything, yeah I'm on that jigga shit
Niggas went AWOL me I stayed militant
Oh yeah, they fucking with me now
They frown when you're winning but they smile when you're down
From this point on, I ain't fucking with them clowns
I'm standing on a beach and I hope you niggas drown

[Chorus]

(Sample)
Yea man
This real rap
You know..You gotta one yourself around these niggas man
I gave my life for you niggas
I put years in the correction facility for you niggas man
Young Pac!
I love you niggas though boy

[Outro]

I wanna thank everybody for listening to the motherfucking 'Whole Key Thing Is'
I hope you enjoyed yourself!
It's your boy Almeen
And right now, we in Mad Base recording
They say music is timeless...So I ain't gon' say the date yet nigga
The 'Whole Key Thing Is'man..I'm having fun right now
You feel me
I'm letting the champagne flow, but I hardly even sip the shit
Almeen..young, fly, flashy nigga...
I'm gone

[Chorus]</pre>
