Song:   Louder Than Wordz
Typed by: Cno Evil

[Chorus 2X: Candi Staton sample]
Music speaks louder than words
It's the only thing that the whole world listens to
Music speaks louder than words
When you sing, people -- the whole world listens to

[Dom Pachino]
It's like my music speaks louder than words
It's like a nigga sing louder than birds, my shit loud and obsurd
It's like my beats bang live, you hard
It's like my beats bang live, you hard
CD, every month, I put work in the lab
I'm a scientist, my alliance is straight math
Red Bic pen looking like blood in the pad
I was the runt in the stash, capture your mind like a blunt in the stash
I cash in, fucking with Dom P., in the latest fashion
Militant, throw your militant camouflage gear on, baby pa
Fucking with Dom P., you fucking with a scarred
Soldier, I've been through war and all that shit
Came back with the Napalm click
Ya'll can't fuck with Dom P. shit
He's so raw, he's so true
He just represent the Napalm crew
Killarm', one love, we all come through
That's my fam forever, don't get it twist', kid
I have to sever, Arms Leg Leg Arm, Allah
Being, the strong, ya'll can't fuck with Napalm
Ya'll can't fuck with the way we get it on, nigga

[Hook 2X: Dom Pachino]
I cash in, fucking with Dom P., in the latest fashion
It's militant, it's militant, it's militant

[Dom Pachino]
Yo, aiyo I feel so powerful, the whole world listen to me
But if a quarter understood me, it would be pudding
Now that sounds good, my raps do to, my music speaks louder
It's the music of the whole Ferry boa, my music's like dope
Have you beemed up, the feds thought they had me in the skull, atleast they think so
Technology is something else, you heard me?
Special, you get me? Everytime I try to die right, they left me
I was doomed, especially, cuz I was produced by a different entity
And soon to be the best M.C.
My music speaks louder than words, ya'll niggas speak and obsurd
When you sing man, sing out loud, man, loud and clear
