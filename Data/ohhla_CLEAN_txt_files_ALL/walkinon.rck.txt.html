[Intro: Rick Ross]
I pray we all live forever
I pray I'm a servant to all prophets
May I be rich forever

[Rick Ross]
Money on my head, pussy boy, that ain't enough
Pull up to your trap strapped in my armored truck
Your mami house next, tell that bitch to duck {*gunshot*}
Ain't no sympathyin' in the city streets
That's all I ever heard from my older G's
She say she love me, but I know she play for keeps
Slip a black snake in a nigga's sheets
Bought a bitch a hundred acres, all red roses
Half you niggas Judas, I'm the son of Moses
Illuminated, resurrected as Selassie I!
Bob Marley through the trumpets on the day I die
Rolls Royces on dirt roads, we dope boys
(Dope boys.. dope boys.. dope boys..)

Baptized by the dope boys
Ordained by the assholes
My salvation is the cash flow
WOAH! Ohh.. I'm walkin' on air

[Chorus: Rick Ross]
I'm talkin' big, bitch, I'm talkin' big
I'm talkin' big, bitch, I'm talkin' big
We do it big, bitch, we do it big

[Rick Ross]
I'm into fashion, nigga, John the Baptist
My loyalty respected all across the atlas
I can have you and your team finalized
All your kids screaming at Mount Sinai {*gunshots*}
Holy Ghost, the divine spirit
My heart pure, he a REAL NIGGA
She let me fuck early so she trustworthy
Her pussy sacred so she gettin' all the purses
In his name I'm Supreme Lord
The Book of Leviticus is the springboard
Jesus Christ, look at this nigga's ICE
Better yet, look at this nigga's life
... I'm walkin' on air

{M-M-M-M-M-M}

[Meek Mill]
You already know, I give and go and I get that dope (dope)
Nigga with that O, I move that shit like tic-tac-toe (ohh!)
And these be niggas hatin' like ''Meek Mill, how you get that ho?''
Cause I get that dough, and I switch that flow, just check my style, look at that Ro'
on my wrist; on some shit, make a call "Who is this?"
Think it's Benji, on the line, and he called, tried to flip
What I do? Make a call, call Papi, for a brick
And papi call JosÃ©, cause JosÃ© got fish
Now I'm 30,000 feet up with my feet up, rollin' weed up
Pussy niggas couldn't bluff us, couldn't beat us
Throwin' curveballs in the field get you hit like Derek Jeter
Double M, yeah that's the team, I know they see us, yeah

{M-M-M-M}

[Rick Ross]
Wait a minute, wait a minute
Wait a minute, wait a minute
Wait a minute, wait a minute

[Chorus]

[Rick Ross]
Fuck a tutor, better get a shooter
Teach your ass a lesson when they runnin' to ya
Fiends lining up like we having communions
This my daily bread and you niggas consumers
All I ever wanted was to make scrilla
Have a recordin' session with J Dilla
Selassie I, Exodus
Corinthians, Leviticus
I'm on the books, I study well
Getting money, bitches know me well
HUH!

[Outro: Rick Ross]
Selassie I...
Selassie I...
Pray I never die...
I pray I never die...</pre>
