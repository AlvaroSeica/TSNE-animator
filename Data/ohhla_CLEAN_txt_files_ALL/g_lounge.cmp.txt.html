[Chris Tucker sample]
I know you don't smoke weed... I know this...but I'ma getchu high today

[Chiba]
Tell me where you get it
We get it from the Ganja Lounge
Tell me where you got it from
We got it from the Ganja Lounge

G, A, N, J, A
G, A, N, J, A

Tell me where you get it
We get it from the Ganja Lounge
Tell me where you got it from
We got it from the Ganja Lounge

G, A, N, J, A
G, A, N, J, A

[Suede]
You're invited to the Ganja Lounge
Just bring your bamboo
The Jamaican Coconut rum got my body going through
Different emotions
Watching the ocean turn into course blue
Blinking the screen, pelicans, palm trees
Paint the scene
No clothes and bungalows
G-strings, kaleidoscopes
That's how a hunger low
I'm leaving a heavy load
At the Ganja Lounge
Where they be burning on pounds
Where your women bring your lemon
Corona another sound

[Chiba]
M' nah like niggaz
M' nah like chumps
M' nah like pussies
M' nah like bums
But what I like is stolen nya
Mya on my Thai stick
Heat brush hot desire
Lipstick on my Regazels
Like that backroom of the Ganja Lounge
Foreign Â‘erbs in the air
Screaming words in the air
My third triple-x scene
With Chanel no. 19
Gave her fancy footwork
Had her put me on to Ilene
(Ganja...)

[Suede]
When you fawn to your ganja
Your lover, her lover
Daytime we sailing
Nighttime we hover
Then rock...the boat
And take me to that place I love
And stop...and go
And then we puff another
Dump a cloud up my vision
Then a lounge where we living
Where the bezels is better
Whenever we fly with no pigeons
And white sand walkways
Diamond crystal hallways
Titties, ya, always
Pussy, haze, and dark shades

[Chiba]
The Lo Wranglers
Of course we mix and matching
With Apache Strangers
Figured they Virgin Islands
Till they walls Niagara Falls
Martini rasi body waters
Hate was for the war
Fornicated with Nazi bitches
Liquorated chocolate
Braun Rico's Rum
An arm full of Zambuca
Ganja Lounge, Mega Lounge
Chicks having cocktails
Lo-a wearing Crown Royal
Sam Tory Royal Whiskey
Real tings in Ganja Lounge</pre>
