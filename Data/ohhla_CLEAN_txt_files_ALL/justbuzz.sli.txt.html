Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Hey! hey!
Its just the
__ ain't no fun
And if you're Costa Rican
Than you know that we'll be screamin'
Just the opposite on thoughts of every one
Ain't got no money
Just a buzz
'cause living in the nineties is a bust
Fight! fight!
You've got to fight __
Survival of the fittest ain't no game
And if you dont believe me
Than i know that you'll deceive me
Just a second and
I'm coming back again
Ain't got no money just a buzz
Cause living in the nineties is a bust
Ain't got no money just a buzz
Cause living in the nineties is a bust
Fight fight... and die</pre>
