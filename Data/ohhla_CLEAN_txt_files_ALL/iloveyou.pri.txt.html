PS - Hey baby, what's your name
JZ - They call me captain backslap, a.k.a., bankroll J
JZ - You wanna get with me, you gotsta pay the fee
PS - Oh yeah, so what you doing later
JZ - Hey I like those leather pants, how much those cost
PS - A lot
JZ - Ready to spend that on me for that lovin'
PS - Maybe

[Princess Superstar]
Baby you got what I need
Try to sleep, I haven't slept, try to eat, I forget
Shit where's your number, hope that's the one I kept
Now we just met and I suspect I might just love you
Well you can bet I'm mad thinkin' of ya, don't wanna trouble ya
Check my dress, about the same color as my B.M.W
Think about my hand round that penis
Damn son, you just had a stroke of genius
Like Manson, your eyes are like going crazy
Like Macy Gray I'm a get you up and do somethin'

[J-Zone]
You wanna do somethin', take me to Macy's
Do I love you, uh-uh, nope, not lately
Dick ain't free, I charge by the stroke
I break you off but I ain't with being broke
I don't love you, I like you, now open your purse
You wanna give me some ass, first give me the cash
I sell dick like Avon and take no crap
You wanna date me then make my bankroll fat
Cough it up, see you fellas got it wrong fuckin' for free
Reverse the game, chicks pay when they fuckin' with me

[Princess Superstar]
Fine, okay, so that's the way you like it
Get you Henny but watch it I might spike it
If you were wearin' a skirt I'd tell you to hike it
And when we get down best believe I'm a mic it
You must be used to all this winin' and dinin'
Just drink your wine, I don't wanna hear your whinin'
Gonna get mine, no fight alright, I'm fucking you tonight

[Princess Superstar]
I'll throw rocks at your window while you sleep at home
And if that don't work, well I'll just throw you this song

[J-Zone]
Well if you ever feel freaky I'll be your ho
But if you ain't got my cash I'll be out the door

[J-Zone]
I wanna rest and dress and look purdy
Livin' off my women and retire at thirty

[Princess Superstar]
I like it dirty, hottie, buy you Karl Kani
Armani, lick Criss off Punani

[J-Zone]
Young ladies wanna swallow mine
Not till I see dollar signs
Can I give you some lovin', hell no
My cock isn't short, I'm a male ho

[Princess Superstar]
Male ho, huh, I'm a make you my housewife
Get your ass indoors, please, see, I asked nice

[J-Zone]
We went to lunch, you thought I was payin'
Hey bitch, I go to Dutch, you thought I was playin'
I finished the food and I was out the door
For the price I like you but do I love you no

[Princess Superstar]
Get back here, lobster costs thirty-five bucks
I want an hour for each dollar, that's thirty-five fucks (what)
No hugs, just my diamond thug
Come on baby, baby, give me that nasty love (well strip)

Just one moment please, just one moment please
Just one moment please, just one moment please

[Princess Superstar]
I'll throw rocks at your window while you sleep at home
And if that don't work, well I'll just throw you this song

[J-Zone]
Well if you ever feel freaky I'll be your ho
But if you ain't got my cash I'll be out the door

[J-Zone]
Yes, just a little something to let these, ladies know
Captain backslap ain't free baby
I got twelve inches and I ain't just talkin' about my records
You know what I mean, ten dollars in this
Ten dollars, a hundred dollars, more money, more money, more money
Uh, just give me the cash, uh
Don't hold out, don't hold out now
You gotta pay up, not till I see dollar signs
Uh, so open your purse and pay me

[Princess Superstar]
I'll throw rocks at your window while you sleep at home
And if that don't work, well I'll just throw you this song

[J-Zone]
Well if you ever feel freaky I'll be your ho
But if you ain't got my cash I'll be out the door

[Princess Superstar]
I'll throw rocks at your window while you sleep at home
And if that don't work, well I'll just throw you this song

[J-Zone]
Well if you ever feel freaky I'll be your ho
But if you ain't got my cash I'll be out the door</pre>
