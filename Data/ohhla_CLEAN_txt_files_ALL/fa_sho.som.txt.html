[ VERSE: Opio ]
I can't escape my thoughts, my mind spirals until the vinyl stops
You can't survive the rock
I lock on to the mic
Inspired by the biters who try us on for size
Disguised as rappers, but their lyrics are too massive
My syle has elasticity
I bounce back and take a new shape, you can't get with me
A true writer, my brain has the capacity
To outlast MC's
They reach inside of themselves, a vast empty space
They'll never taste victory
I'm sick of these
Fake ass niggas, they all some bitches
I kick rhymes enriching hip-hop
With A-Plus on my back we shock
The world

Gon' shock the world

[ VERSE: A-Plus ]
A-Plus without a doubt for real
If you without the skill
To turn it out
Get your ass to cuttin
You steady caught in your frontin
And y'all can keep on bluffin
But I got a little somethin
You ain't know what I got, who do you think this is
When I rhyme I'm like your daddy whoopin on one of my kids
Look at this
Another crew that's caught up in mix
(Hieroglyphics turn it out) And now we all up in yo shit
It's perfectly calculted
Exceptionally rated
People be talkin but I don't trip and I know they hate it
But I be mindin my bidness
And the Most High is my witness
We won't die 'fore we get these meal tickets
Now I'ma let you know how it's gon' go fo sho
I stack dough, unveil the mack show
And that's no problem
You got a crew, go call 'em
Tell 'em withdraw cause we know that they ain't really raw
Come on, y'all

Fo sho fa real

[ VERSE: Phesto ]
We strictly satisfaction
If they givin up action
Ain't a minute for slack, cause time is money, baby
I can't hold it back
Word to Manny Stacks, Jocci
J-Biz, B. Griffin, Martini &amp; Rossi
Niggas hittin high speed
Smokin asphalt, no Thai weed
Straight Oakland style with the hash block
Cash knots in my pocket with knock to blast
I put the EQ to 10, reminiscin about that cock last
Night, waitin for this fool to bend a corner
Partner, hit the gas like a champ bumpin this
Big Tour√© drums and that fat-ass bassline hummin
Thinkin' about comin up before the summer hit
Then bubblin, run my shit for doublin shows
So promoters owe us more than four figures with hoes
Disclosin hourglass shapes for the Souls
ESO's finest, diamonds 'round my wrist is bliss
It's like this
Y'all

[ VERSE: Tajai ]
Hoes perpetrate that rudebwoy, I roll with Hiero-
glypics here to make the bump circulate
Sous of Mischief, man, you no we comin for you with Folgers
Heat them flows up until they smolder
Eventually crackle
Like you mentally in the back of your mind
You hear that fiendish cackle of mine
I've seen it many times
And I'ma see it again but remain unseen
Cause y'all niggas be sweatin
Constantly remindin me
I live amongst thieves who will bite these
But still they rhymes be spindly, weight-deficient
I leave 'em shorter then Vicious
Cause dem are weak
So I gots to pull they hem up
It's also known the way I do it, just watch
Get shot
It's all about that body rock
It don't stop
Y'all</pre>
