[Intro - DJ AM - talking] (Skillz) - w/ ad libs at the end
(I need you to tell you what's in your backpack, right now)
Right now in my backpack is a laptop, four records (uh huh)
One of 'em's +Peter Piper+ 12"
Three Serato records, two needles, headphones and four condoms 
(*laughing*)

[Verse 1 - Skillz]
They say they never really miss ya 'til you're already gone
I keep tryin to tell myself you're better at home
Ever since the angels claimed you as one of they own
Never told ya some of the things I'm a say in this song
When we first met, it was nothin but love
Taken aback by the fact you even knew who I was
I knew you from the tabloids and read what they said
Only to find out, you was a real hip-hop head
Hardcore Philly kid, doin pretty good
Moved to LA and never went Hollywood
And that was just the start
of a friendship built on sneakers and '90's hip-hop
Yeah the world was saddened when they lost DJ AM
I'm speakin for those that lost Adam
Fam we miss you so much
Man I wish you know the lives you touched

[Chorus - Skillz]
We tryin to be strong Adam, tryin to hold the tears
And cope with the fact that you no longer here
Feels like we fallin, with nothin to grab
Pushin through our days, some good, some bad (some bad)
Maybe I'm sayin too much
But I want you to know that your name will live on through us (through us)
I swear to God that's true
And everytime we hear (aww yeah), we think about you

[Verse 2 - Skillz]
They say everything happens for a reason
And now more than ever, we all know that's true
But none of us could really know what you was goin through
The only one who could walk in your shoes was you
Surviving a plane crash, I can't imagine it
But God saw fit for you and Trav to live
And after that, it was never discussed
We all took for granted that you would probably outlive us
I'm just bein real kid
Losin you? Something that we all still deal with
The fans weren't the only ones
We lost a friend but two women lost a brother and a son
Now you returned to the essence
And I just wanna say, to be in your presence, that was a blessing
Fam we miss you so much
Man I wish you knew the lives you touched

[Chorus - Skillz]
We tryin to be strong Adam, tryin to hold the tears
And cope with the fact that you no longer here
Feels like we fallin, with nothin to grab
Pushin through our days, some good, some bad (some bad)
Maybe I'm sayin too much
But I want you to know that your name will live on through us (through us)
I swear to God that's true
So when you hear a (aww yeah), just know that it's for you

[Outro - Skillz - talking] (*echo*)
We miss you man, all of us
Like just, just everything about you like
I wish people had an opportunity to just know you and
Know the kind of person that you were
Like how funny you was, how crazy you was
Times we had
Like remember, remember that time the girl was pulling on your pants leg
When you was DJing and you just started playing +Dumb Girl+
Like in the middle of the party
Or how you would just play rappers' old demos
At like an LA, Hollywood spot, just, just 'cause you could, ha
How you used to play Alc's record in the middle of a party, just to piss him off
Or like, just, just your word mixes and how you would mix up certain songs
Like I, I can't hear those songs without thinking about you
Just the little things man I miss
Like when you made me perform +The Nod Factor+ at Rain at like 2 a.m.
I look at you, you're like "I'm keeping it real"
Ha, remember that?
Or how we used to just analyze rappers' lyrics
And just, all the things that sounded suspect
You be like, aiyyo, ha
Rest in peace, DJ AM, Adam Goldstein (aww yeah ...)
(Alright ...)</pre>
