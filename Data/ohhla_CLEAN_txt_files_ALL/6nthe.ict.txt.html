[Verse One: Ice-T]
Six in the morning, police at my door
Fresh Adidas squeak across the bathroom floor
Out my back window, I made my escape
Didn't even get a chance to grab my old school tape
Mad with no music, but happy cause I'm free
And the streets to a player is the place to be
Got a knot in my pocket, weighing at least a grand
Gold on my neck, my pistol is closed in hand
I'm a self-made monster of the city streets
Remotely controlled by hard Hip-Hop beats
But just living in the city is a serious task
Didn't know what the cops wanted, didn't have time to ask

[Break]
Word!! Word!! Word!!

[Verse Two: Ice-T]
Seen my homeboys cooling way way out
Told them about my morning, cold bugged them out
Shot a little dice until my knees got sore
Kicked around some stories about the night before
Possed to the corner where the fly girls chill
Through action at some freaks until one bitch got ill
She started acting silly, simply would not quit
Called us all punk pussies, said we all weren't shit
As we walked over to her, whore continued to speak
So we beat the bitch down in the goddamn street
But just living in the city is a serious task
Bitch didn't know what hit her, didn't have time to ask

[Break]
Word!! Word!! Word!!

[Verse Three: Ice-T]
Continued clocking freaks with the man's posteriors
Rolling in the Blazer with the Louie interior
Solid gold, the ride was raw, bust a left turn was on Crenshaw
Sean E Sean was the driver, known to give freaks hell
Had a beeper going off like the high school bell
Looked in the mirror, what do we see?
Fucking blue lights L.A.P.D.
Pigs searched our car, their day was made
Found an uzi, .44 and a Handgranade
Threw us in the county, high powered block
No freaks to see, no beats to rock
Didn't want trouble but the shit must fly
Squabbled with this sucker, shanked him in the eye
But living in the county is a serious task
Nigga didn't know what happened, didn't have time to ask

[Break]

[Verse Four: Ice-T]
Back on the streets after five and a deuce
Seven years later, but still had the juice
My homeboy Hen Gee, put me up on the track
Told me E's rolling Villain, BJs has got the sack
Bruce is a giant, Nat C's clocking Dough
B-Bop's a pimp, my old freak's a whore
The Batterram's rolling, rocks are the thing
Life has no meaning and money is king
Then he looked at me slowly and Hen had to grin
He said: Man you're out early we thought you got ten
Opened up his safe, kicked me down with cold cash
Knew I would get busy, he didn't waste time to ask

[Break]
Word!! Word!! Word!!

[Verse Five: Ice-T]
I bought a Benz with the money, the rest went on clothes
Went to the strip, started pimping the whores
My hair had grew long, on my seven year stay
And when I got it done, on my shoulders it lay
Hard from the joint, but fly to my heart
I didn't want trouble but the shit had to start
Out with my crew, and some punks got loud
Shot gun blasts, echoed through the crowd
Six punks hit, two punks died
All casualties were applied to their side
Human Lives had to pass, just for talking much trash
We didn't know who they were, no one had time to ask

[Break]
Word!! Word!! Word!!

[Verse Six: Ice-T]
Swat team leader yelled hit the floor
Reached in my pocket pulled my .44
Dove across the room, peeped out the window
Twenty cops jumped behind the Pinto
Out the back door like some damn track stars
Broke down an alley jumped into a car
Suckers didn't even see us, they must've been blind
Black wire touched red, the car was mine
We hadn't done nothing but some suckers got shot
Hit the first turn goddamn road blocked
Broke through the block and we did it fast
Cops would shot us on sight, they wouldn't took time to ask

[Break]
Word!! Word!! Word!!

[Verse Seven: Ice-T]
The rollers gave chase at a serious speed
One more conviction was all I need
This shit was for real, this was no La-Di-Da-Di
Cause the boys had to pin the shit on somebody
And me and my crew, we were known to get ill
We carried heat for protection but not to kill
We bust a corner doing 60; one police car spun
And all I was thinking, was murder one
Bust a move into an alley and did it right
And me and my crew, we're gone into the night
Broke to my old ladies, who drew me a bath
She didn't even know what happened, didn't care, didn't ask

[Break]
Word!! Word!! Word!!

[Verse Eight: Ice-T]
We made love like crazy on top of the sheets
This girlie was my worldly, a natural freak
She ran her tongue over each and every part of me
Then she rocked my Amadeus while I watched TV
A technician with a mission, that's what she was
If there had been a crowd, she would've got an applause
This girl did everything on earth to me that could be done
The she backed off and teased me so I couldn't come
Then she cold got stupid, pushed me on the floor
Had me begging to stop, while I was screaming for more
After she waxed by body, she let me crash
She knew her loving was deaf, she didn't waste time to ask

[Break]
Word!! Word!! Word!!

[Verse Nine: Ice-T]
Up the next morning, feeling good as hell
Sleeping with a girlie, sure beats a cell
Hit the boulevard in my A.M.G.
Whores catching whiplash, trying to glimpse the T
Ring on my mobile yes cellular
Got to have a phone when I'm in my car
Was my homeboy Red, some say he's insane
Broke his bitch jaw for smoking cane
Told me to meet him at the Airport
Said he's jumping bail, said he just left court
Caught the first thing smoking in a serious dash
He didn't know where we was going, didn't care, didn't ask

[Break]
Word!! Word!! Word!!

[Verse Ten: Ice-T]
Fell asleep on the plane and so did he
Woke up chilling in N.Y.C.
Called on my posse, when I got there
Hit the Latin Quarter, in Union Square
Rooftop Devil's Nest, the rest we passed
Back doored the Palladium, just for class
About 4:00 AM, we crashed the deuce
We never catch static cause my boys got juice
Deuced it to the Bronx, to rest our heads
Where a shoot out jumped off, nine people lay dead
It sounded like it happened with a Mac 10 Blast
But it was six in the morning, we didn't wake up to ask
