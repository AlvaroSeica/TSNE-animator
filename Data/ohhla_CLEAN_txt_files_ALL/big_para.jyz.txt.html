* Jay-Z lyrics from OHHLA.com originally

[Jay-Z]
*Laughing*
You're wasting your talent Randy!

[Mike Shinoda]
Yeah, ready?

[Chorus 1: Mike Shinoda]
It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda (Chester Bennington)]
Why does it look like night today?
Something in here's not right today
Why am I so uptight today?
Paranoia's all I got left
I don't know what stressed me first
Or how the pressure was fed
But I know just what it feels like
To have a voice in the back of my head
It's like a face that I hold inside
A face that awakes when I close my eyes
A face that watches every time they lie
A face that laughs every time they fall
(And watches everything)
So you know that when it's time to sink or swim
That the face inside is hearing me
Right underneath my skin

[Chorus 1: Mike Shinoda]

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
You know I - thug em, fuck em, love em, leave em
Cause I don't fuckin need em
Take 'em out the hood, keep 'em lookin good
But I don't fuckin feed em
First time they fuss I'm breezin
Talkin bout, "What's the reasons?"
I'm a pimp in every sense of the word, bitch
Better trust than believe em
In the cut where I keep em
Til I need a nut, til I need to beat the guts
Then it's, beep beep and I'm pickin 'em up
Let 'em play with the dick in the truck
Many chicks wanna put Jigga fist in cuffs
Divorce him and split his bucks
Just because you got good head, I'ma break bread
So you can be livin it up?  Shit I.
Parts with nothin, y'all be frontin
Me give my heart to a woman?
Not for nothin, never happen
I'll be forever mackin
Heart cold as assassins, I got no passion
I got no patience
And I hate waitin.
Hoe get yo' ass in
And let's RI-I-I-I-I-IDE.. check 'em out now
RI-I-I-I-I-IDE, yeah
And let's RI-I-I-I-I-IDE.. check 'em out now
RI-I-I-I-I-IDE, yeah

[Chorus 2: Jay-Z]
We doin.. big pimpin, we spendin cheese
Check 'em out now
Big pimpin, on B.L.A.D.'s
We doin.. big pimpin up in N.Y.C
It's just that Jigga Man, Pimp C, and B-U-N B
Yo yo yo.. big pimpin, spendin cheese
We doin - big pimpin, on B.L.A.D.'s
We doin.. big pimpin up in N.Y.C
It's just that Jigga Man, Pimp C, and B-U-N B</pre>
