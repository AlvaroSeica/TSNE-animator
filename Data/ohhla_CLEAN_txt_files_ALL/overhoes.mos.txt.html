Typed by: kirenamloh@msn.com

[Chorus w/ "bitch" whispered after each line]
Homies over hoes, homies over hoes
Homies over hoes, homies over hoes
Do the homie! Do the homie!
Do the homie! Do the homie!

[Gangstalicious (Mos Def)]
You never catch the 'Lic', rollin with no bitch
'Cause bitches ain't shit, you saw my crew is thick
Whole bunch of knuckleheads, the bald heads and dreads
Nigga, we hatin on them hoes like we hate the feds
Bitch, cain't you see~?! Fall back away from me
Me and my niggaz bumpin CHEST in the VIP
Now bump it to the left, and bump it to the right
'Cause when you do the homie, nigga got to do it right

[Chorus]

[Gangstalicious (Mos Def)]
Uh..
'Cause bitches be trouble, be havin niggaz beefin
You trickin on that ho, and yo' niggaz ain't eatin
She pushin yo' whip, spendin all yo' cash
Yo' homie got shot up, while you was in dat ass -- BEEITCH!!

[Chorus]</pre>
