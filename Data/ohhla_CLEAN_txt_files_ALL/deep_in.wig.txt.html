[Shawn Wigs]
Yo, aiyo deep in the push where my taste bud goes
Hair up my nose, hand up your clothes
Strike up a posse, I'mma switch my position
I wipe off my dick when I pass through the kitchen
I hit you if you ain't clean that pussy all week
Once I get past the smell, I'm in it for the heat
The head and the hot spicy sheets on the bed
While the porno flick music plays in my head
You make it, hard to greet you, you love when I eat you
But I, got a few things girl, I like to teach you
Let's rock the boat, we can pimp it out in my ride
And if your girlfriend's waiting, she can come inside
Join the fun, two is cool, I'm good with one
She can wait outside til we done, I'm like whatever</pre>
