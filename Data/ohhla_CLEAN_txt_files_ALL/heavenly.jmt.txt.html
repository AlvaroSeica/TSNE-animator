yo, yo, yo
Jedi Mind
Heavenly Divine
steadily shine
ikon the fucking hologram
yo, yo, yo, yo

[Ikon the H ologram]
another sacrificial lamb
is out of the hands of hologram
send him into the dungeon and plunder his fucking plan
holy land
who spit the live shit
the do or die in the jail, Jedi Mind shit
the hot shit
live raps crack your jaw
like who's the avenger and who's at the center of war
i left the scar
so your crabs would over sand
mental will dent you and take you to a holy land, lord know the man
sharp blades slash your vitals
recitals will fight you and entice you to burn bibles
homicidal
hologram burn churches
murders by sticking a crucifix through your cervix
divine purpose
for the remi thats in my thermos
wait and see we'll stick you with needles thats hypodermic
you heard the verdict
Im with Allah cause he chose me
broke into the Vattican strangled the pope with his rosary
what, what what what, what, what what what what

[Chorus Repeat 4x]
jedi mind heavenly divine
steadily shine in '99
what what

[Jus Allah]
mc's face terror wherever my sounds audible
banned from third world portals battle mortals and slaughter you
seen inside the places of beyond
the dwellings of the Omn
resistance in Islamic patheon
flows got the breeze on my clothes got the scent of trees
I lay back and blow sax like Kenny G
power blast wiping my path devour fast
I leave you with the grain of sand in life's hour glass
divide the spell
the demons rise out of hell
gun buying lapels and rob you of your outer shell
you feel the ill dire who sire and hell fire
I launch writers
put the drawn on Gong's wire
Jedi swordsmen give rappers a foul furtune
what shines slippin torches in your body into a coffin
insane damage is done, you fucking with the army
we beat the skulls in the shape of wet bag of laundry
what, yea yea

[Chorus 4x]

[Ikon]
yo the gods around, the dramatarzan

[Jus Allah]
your fibical light, law of the titans

[Ikon]
we like a fucking bolt of lightning

[Jus Allah]
the three wisemen

[Ikon]
we at levels that defy men

[Jus Allah]
watch out for fake heads deviled the skysmen

[Ikon]
arriving from the dawn and spawned with ill form

[Jus Allah]
battle leave you laying dead in the balm like stillborns

[Ikon]
the master herein

[Jus Allah]
the ominous the master spirit

[Ikon]
can't understand the language of rappers with bile lyrics

[Jus Allah]
ikon the python

[Ikon]
rappers are left strangled

[Jus Allah]
I overlook the earth cause I see it from sun's angle

[Ikon]
above the clouds

[Jus Allah]
we set high, we daze
write a page
on how you enslave the worldly way

[Ikon]
Islamic marksmen

[Jus Allah]
seeing the squad then..

[Ikon]
..could be your fatal mistake

[Jus Allah]
like the first sins of Adam in the garden

[Ikon]
you feel sorrow
I projected is all Apollo

[Jus Allah]
explore realms you left too confused to follow

[Ikon]
invite your town to absorb the sniper rounds

[Jus Allah]
Illadelph, Shamballah, nigga staying underground

[Chorus 4x]</pre>
