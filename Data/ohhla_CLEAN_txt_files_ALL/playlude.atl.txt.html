Let me say something

[Cold 187Um]
Life goes on, I mean last year was a good year
But not a great year!
I mean umm, it was a good year 
Because umm.. we're coming through a lot of things
I mean throw up the West sign, the East sign, the North sign 
Even I maybe think way way way down south
Yeah, we get the chance
You know, I mean, uh, I even heard they labelled us as a bad boys
I mean, fuck them
You know, it's that thought
I guess, we better take our chance, ha ha
How many players even heard we being known as pimp a whore or two?
You know, true, true, I mean yeah, that maybe true
But they missed not what they know is what they can prove
No, no, I mean I once knew a player 
Who woke up on the right side of the bed
You know, he was living fly and have all these fancy things
But when he got greedy, that nigga played himself
You know, on the next day
He woke up on the wrong side of the bed, umm dead
I mean, umm stepping on number two to become number one 
I mean, I'm mean, we are bigger than that
I mean, umm you know, it used to be a zone here, a zone there
I mean, there was a flock of birds here, a flock of birds there
I mean, it all mean pigeons baby
I mean, we wanna enterprise
I mean, we wanna extend what we wanna enterprise
I mean, like umm, yeah, whores</pre>
