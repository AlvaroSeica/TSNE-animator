[The Grouch]
Can't even call it, I just don't know
It's like I don't know why I do what I do
I just do..
Either way, sometimes it don't feel right
Most of the times, god damnit it does

Til death do us part, a piece of me fights to be with you
but as sure as I have breath, I'll swear one day I'll quit you
Know I have to put you down, can't stand for you around
Will my power be enough or will you drain me, pain me
Til death do us part.. (yup), til death do us part..

You came into my life - evil in disguise, very casual
We didn't always kick it it grew gradual
Hooked up in times of stress I felt blessed
You would, help me with my problems
Get at me real deep like when I wasn't usin my noggin
You're my main thing 
I couldn't kick it with a drink when I took you out
Hooked me you were different came from India no doubt
Now everybody knew you had that natural brown skin
Started fiendin to always hit you, light your butt, go on in
We get caught up in all ways, I'm a fool with you for days and
pray you wouldn't hurt me just desert me you're a phase
That's what I told myself when you started chillin too much
Caught you kickin it with my friends, how could you go and do such
a sin, now I'm achin on the inside, awake
and in the middle of the night, somehow not feelin right
Well now, it's you or me I choose the latter call me greedy
Bizarre feeling the needy, "Oh you smoke beadies?"

Til death do us part, a piece of me fights to be with you
but as sure as I have breath, I'll swear one day I'll quit you
Know I have to put you down, can't stand for you around
Will my power be enough or will you drain me, pain me
Til death do us part.. I said til death do us part..
Til death do us part.. why, why?  I'ma be.. not knowin

Beautiful not deadly, fuckin with my head G
Infiltrated quick I thought I, peeped the skit already
Steady on my track then, mack mack mack mackin
Excruciate the action, no more jack jack jack jackin
the Jim off, she went off on a tangent tryin to kick it
I said no commitments I just needed a place to stick it
She was with it, I would hit it all the time it was mine
without, really bein mine and that was fine she wanted more
She's like poor, I'ma show you that, I'm the only one for you
Make your life real fun for you give unto you that's all I want to do
It turned me off, why I pushed the girl away
And I did this every day til she finally went astray and
started kickin it with the enemy, actin like a friend to me
Now I begin to see, envy
jealousy don't know which way to call it
Forever unconvinced story of my life yup, a hopeaholic

Til death do us part, a piece of me fights to be with you
but as sure as I have breath, I'll swear one day I'll quit you
Know I have to put you down, can't stand for you around
Will my power be enough or will you drain me, pain me
Til death do us part, a piece of me fights to be with you
but as sure as I have breath, I'll swear one day I'll quit you
Know I have to put you down, can't stand for you around
Will my power be enough or will you pain me, drain me
Til death do us part.. til death do us part..

I can't live..
with or without you..
I can't live..
with or without you..
I can't live..</pre>
