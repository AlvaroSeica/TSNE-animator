Typed by: AZ Lyrics

This is a story of a man on the edge
Who all but lost his way until one day, he discovered in his palms
A rocket launcher!
Enjoy this tale of a personal rejuvenation, redemption and scrubification
As told by the great Shaggy 2 Dope!

Grand Papi, was a World War II vet
And I found his bazooka set in the basement,
With a bag of mortars
Yeah, bitch, I'm done taking orders,
Dragged it outside and tried it out
Dropped the shell in and fired it out
Across the street to the neighbour's kitchen
And now half of their house's missing
Fuck yeah!
I grabbed the rockets
Beer truck in the scope unlocked it
Blew the wheels off and flipped it twice
I'm realizing with the Zook Nice

And I'm dancing!
He's dancing
With a God damn bazooka
Bazooka Joey!
Bazooka!
Bazooka Joey!

And I'm dancing!
He's dancing
With a God damn bazooka
Bazooka Joey!
Bazooka!
Bazooka Joey!

I sent a hot one
Right through the doors
And let it mangled in a pile of boards
I swear my shoulder is loving the shot
Fucked up an H &amp; R Block.
I'm blowing new cop cars into stock yards
Bitch, this is a bazooka
You not hard!
See the swat team hiding in the limousine,
It seems they smithereens!
Pull out my hair, screaming and laughing
Get shot at and shooting back in
Terrorizing
Paralyzing
Bazooka Baby
Electrifying!

And I'm dancing!
He's dancing
With a God damn bazooka
Bazooka Joey!
Bazooka!
Bazooka Joey!

And I'm dancing!
He's dancing
With a God damn bazooka
Bazooka Joey!
Bazooka!
Bazooka Joey!

Raid vans, you gotta be kidding,
I take out a tank, I ain't bullshittin',
Call me the crater creator,
Drop you like a elevator,
Big hater!

(Inaudible)
'Drop your weapon!'
All I can do is laugh,
Who the fuck is you all demandin'?
I leave a fuckin' ditch where you standin'

FOX news, turn it up loud,
Imma blow the ground to a mushroom cloud,
So tune in before I get shot,
Bazooka Joey blowin' up the spot,

And I'm dancing!
He's dancing
With a God damn bazooka
Bazooka Joey!
Bazooka!
Bazooka Joey!

And I'm dancing!
He's dancing
With a God damn bazooka
Bazooka Joey!
Bazooka!
Bazooka Joey!

'Alright we need to secure the perimeter immediately,
Woah, wait a minute, what is that?
Woah woah woah get outta there,
For christ sakes he's gotta god damn bazooka,
Get the fuck up!

And I'm dancing!
He's dancing
With a God damn bazooka
Bazooka Joey!
Bazooka!
Bazooka Joey!

And I'm dancing!
He's dancing
With a God damn bazooka
Bazooka Joey!
Bazooka!
Bazooka Joey!</pre>
