[Intro: Apocalipps]
Hit that, (Cough Cough)
Watch when this next shit drop
Niggas, Niggas really gone be fucked off of that one
Yeah yeah yeah, No doubt. (Cough Cough)
Let's go yall, Finally here
Yeah, Lipps and Jaheim
The remix, Lets go

[Apocalipps]
Yo, Yo if you listening girl, Bottom line I fucked up
I gave you up for what, A bunch of chickens and sluts
You know what, You never asked for much
And I never had to have jewels, You was my diamond in the ruff
You cared about the kid, Never gave a fuck about cloths
I knew you loved me when you helped me pick that booger out my nose
We coped the matchin North Faces, Couldn't fuck with a mink
And the same kind of Timbs, Mines brown yours pink
The little things made you happy, It's hurtin me B
We smoked a blunt, Ge the munchies, Split a turkey and cheese
And it's all fucked up now, It's so hard to get up back
I call your cell a million times you never hit me back
You put in work and you watched me blow up
I seen you wit your man, I was sick I had to throw up
And I think I'ma be alright as bad as it seems
And to show how much I love you, I had to call Jaheim, Nahmean

[Jaheim]
We left the Bricks for the burbs, Turned Mo into Remy
Matching fur coats and Fendi, From the bus to a Bentley coupe
With a closet full of shoes, Yeah, (Yeah Yeah)
Than our smiles turned to frowns, Ups turned to downs
I don't know where I'm going now
I think about her every once in awhile
We started out like Bobby and Whitney
Justen and Brittney, Then it all got ugly
If it weren't for the money, (Ohh No)
You said I start actin funny
But what's wrong witcha honey, (Ohh What's Wrong)
Then the good turned to bad, Forgot what we had
Is it to late to get it back
I think about her more than once in awhile
Like when i spot a rainbow, Or see a fallin star
A set of twins, Or a classic car, (Baby)
A four leaf clover, Or a two dollar bill, (Yeah)
It's so rare that it's so unreal
And I don't know how, To get over her smile
I wonder what she's doin now, (What's Goin On)
I think about her every once in awhile, (Every Once In Awhile)
I should've came with a ring, (Came With A Ring)
Set a date for next May, Guess i thought that you'd wait
Now I hate that I took so long, (Ohhh)
Played around wit her now she's gone, (Ohh No)
Now my smiles turned to frowns, Ups turned to downs
And I don't know where I'm goin, (Now Now Now Now)
I think about her every once in awhile, (Once In A While)
We argued like Archie and Edith, Like Ike turned on Tina
But I really didn't mean it
I was raised not to hit a woman, (I Would Never Raise My Hand)
Especially not the one I'm lovin, (Never Never)
But when the good turned to bad, (Ohh) Happy to sad
I wish we could take it back, (How I miss you baby)
I think about her every once in awhile
Like when I spot a rainbow, Or see a fallin star
A set of twins, Or a classic car, (I Think About Ya Baby)
A four leaf clover or a two dollar bill, (Ohhh)
It's so rare that it's so unreal
And I don't know how, To get over her smile
Wonder what she's doin now
I think about her every once in awhile
Your like a star, Shinning in the broad daylight
Something you don't see all the time
And now I finally recognize, That I shoulda made you all mine
Never shoulda let you pass me by
You put that sparkle in my life
Someone that you don't meet twice
I'm gonna live to regret it baby
Ohhhh, Ohhhh, Baby, Baby
I need you, Need you. (Ohhhhhh)</pre>
