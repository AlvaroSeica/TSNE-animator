NBA Live...2003... Fabolous...Who Gon' Stop Me!!?

[Verse 1]
I hoop with the best of them swooped up the chest of them
dunked on a bunch caught ali-oops on the rest of them
I got the lean on the "J" now
it really don't matter if we play in arenas or playgrounds
throw it around the back so it look fly when I pass
just to avoid the block go high off the glass
I'm killing them out there they gon' have to bring caskets
this all I hear after the baskets *swoosh*
but I ain't even warm up
and still pull from where it counts for 3 points and leave the form up
you must be insane if you give me the lane or perimiter
the crossover will sprain every limb on ya
I never woulda, ever coulda
thought I could come off the baseline and jump over seven-footers
soon as you step out the locker room you now can see
how live it gets in 2003

[Hook: repeat 2X]
Who gon' stop me when I'm in the lane?
I come to entertain you know its in the game
Who gon' stop me? go and get 5
I  D-up with 5 you know it gets live

[Verse 2]
I'm the crowd favorite and I believe the fans
love the way I finger roll it with either hand
my handles pull it through presses plus I can play the lane
and block shots like bulletproof vestes
I often be found in the paint waiting for I miss
so I can slam it back off the rebound
then I show off with class
look the other way when I throw off a pass
call it when I go off the glass
hope ya'll play better "D"
or I'ma keep scoring until the coach hold his hands like the letter "T"
When I put pressure on the ball they be feeling on lock
remind 'em of a jewel theif when I be stealing the rock
shorty over the summer you might have boosted an inch
but if you ain't ballin like me get used to the bench
and everybody know I does my thing
and play hard 'til the buzzer ring, yeah

[Hook]
