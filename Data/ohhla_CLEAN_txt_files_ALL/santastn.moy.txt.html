My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window (window)..and I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray,
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad, it's not so bad..

My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window (window)..and I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray,
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad, it's not so bad..

Dear Santa,
I wrote you but you still ain't callin'
Christmas is just around the corner and snow is fallin'
I sent two letters back in Autumn, I guess you haven't got 'em yet
Unless you did and you just haven't replied you fat lazy git
What's up man, you been out again playin' golf?
Anyways, what's happenin'?  Say "Hi" to my mate Rudolph
I think he's a crazy reindeer as it goes
With them silly dumb-ass antlers, man and that crazy red nose
Anyway forget about that ____, man here's my present list
I hope I get what I want or else I'll be well ____
I want one of them scooters to ride around on
A Kylie Minogue calendar and a Goddamn Pokémon
Hey, what about those toys from TV's "Robot Wars"?
That ain't difficult, you get 'em in all department stores
Anyways, I gotta go now Santa, gotta go down the gym
To stay trim
Write back soon, this is Slim

Dear Santa, 
You still ain't called or wrote, what's going on? 
I've been thinkin' that I've done somethin' wrong
I wrote you already man, in fact I wrote t'you twice
This year I ain't been naughty, man I been real nice
By the way, be careful round this neighbourhood, don't get whacked
I don't want my presents been stolen out your big sack
I'm gonna leave some mince pies at the bottom of the chimney
Hey Santa, you gonna write back, fax me, ring me
My girlfriend thinks I'm strange, I talk about you all the time
I can't wait to meet you Santa when you come round to mine
Don't forget my presents man, I need that Pikachu
If I don't get it, no talkin' from me I'll be eating reindeer stew
Ah, didn't mean to threaten you man, that's just my way
Hey, any chance when you can come I can ride your magic sleigh?
Anyways Santa, go get my presents ready
I got go see my lady
Write back soon, this is Shady

Dear Mr "I'm too busy eatin' mince pies to write to my fans"
You big fat red mother _____
I've been sending you letters for six months now
Why ain't you been writing back?!  You fat lazy cow!
I hope you choke whilst drinking your egg nog
You silly fat ugly lazy pig-dog
Sittin' on your fat ass talking to Rudolph and Blitzen
I'm here with no presents man, I'm ______ bitchin'
You ain't wrote back man, that crime is heinous
I hope Rudolph's antlers kebab your tiny _____
I hope you fall off that sleigh and land in yellow snow!
You come down my chimney, I'll tell you where to go!
When you get to the bottom, don't be expectin' mince pies!
You'll be talkin' to my fist, right between your ______ eyes!
How you gonna fly when your sleigh is out on bricks?
You and your stupid reindeer, you bunch of ______
I'm cycling in the rain on my 10-speed bike
But when I rock the mic, I rock the mic right!
All I wanted was presents, but you couldn't stop meddlin'
(screaming)
Hey shut up elf and keep on peddlin'!
Sorry Santa, that's one of your elfs going side saddle
I found him last night, so I'm taking him for a paddle
So Santa, it seems you're ____ out of luck
You can shove christmas up your ass you fat..., woahhh!!
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH!

(water splashes and unintellible gurgling sounds)

Dear Slim, 
I meant to write you sooner, but I've been busy
All this flying business makes me quite dizzy
I'm flattered that you talk about me all the time
Your girlfriend shouldn't get upset, it's hardly a crime
However, here's a question I'd like to ask if I'm able
Have you ever been described as been slightly unstable?
The reason I ask is that you want a Pikachu
That toy's for a five year old, what the _____'s wrong with you?
As for kidnapping my elf, not a good plan
I'll rip your ______ head off, you crazy mad man
I'm gonna bust you up bad, you dirty little scrote
I'll rip your head off and shove a Pokémon down your throat
You don't deserve any presents 'cause you're ______ loopy
You soft pussy of a girl, I'm not gonna give you a snoopy
'Cause you bust my balls for so long, here's what I'll do
On the night of Christmas Eve, I'm coming to get you
You see I may be Santa, but I'm rock hard
I could kill a man with just a Christmas card
When you stole my elf, you made me sick
I've had elfs stolen from me before you thick ______
There was this one guy, had an elf on a bike
Drove him into a river late one night
And in the basket in the front there was a letter
But it didn't say who it was to
Come to think about it, huh, it was you
Damn</pre>
