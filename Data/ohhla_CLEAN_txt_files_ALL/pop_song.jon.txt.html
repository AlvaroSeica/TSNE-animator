Song:   Pop Song
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Girl, I'm a sexually attractive man
That makes me a good artist
This is my new single
I hope you like it

Wealthy men hired me, to sing
this song that they wrote for me, they're investing
in this pricey music video, and they're paying
to get it played on the radio (on the radio)
and they're gonna sell a million (a million)
yes, it's gonna go platinum

'Cause they'll market this song to
young, impressionable, and
insecure teenage girls
'Cause all you gotta say is
"ooh baby", "I love you", or
"girl, I need you in my world".
Yes, they'll market this song to
young, impressionable, and
insecure teenage girls
'Cause all they gotta do is find
a sexually attractive man that can sing
all the words

And now the token rap verse
that doesn't make any sense
but helps it get a small percentage
of the urban music market

Hey baby, baby I can tell
that you are crazy, crazy
shake that ass girl,
my rhymes are gettin' lazy, lazy
these things I'm talking 'bout have
nothing to do with the song baby
but it don't matter
won't you show me that thong baby?
That's how it works
in the pop music industry
2010 mother fucker
that's just how it be

'Cause they'll market this song to
young, impressionable, and
insecure teenage girls
'Cause all you gotta say is
"ooh baby", "I love you", or
"girl, I need you in my world".
Yes, they'll market this song to
young, impressionable, and
insecure teenage girls
'Cause all they gotta do is find
a sexually attractive man that can sing
all the words

Now I'm singing with my gay voice
to let you know that I am sensitive
Oh yea, I'm singing with my gay voice
teenage girls love a sensitive voice (sensitive voice)
and you know I wanna

(Make money money, make money money, make money) [x3]
Rich men makin' money off of
their investments
ooh it's so sexual baby

Girl, I love you so much.
I wish we could be together
unfortunately we can't because
I'm rich and famous and you're not
but why don't you just go buy my album?
...and tell your friends about it too
so that they also go out and buy it</pre>
