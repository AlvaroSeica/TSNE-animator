Its the intro the wee Scottish rapper
Straight from the Burgh so Thurgh with the banter
Its the intro the wee Scottish rapper
Spent all his time just trying to find an answer

Check your work rate is that your first tape
You dont do like him do you fuck mate
This is you meeting him like a first date
He's no master he aint got the dub plate
No respect for the guys that rhyme
He dont like cunts that just go online
He's no respect for the guys on shine
But do got respect for the guys on grinds
Like green in a grinder a bull in a china
Shop when he talks set watch on reminder
You dont want to miss it he is sitting on a timer
About to peal off like paint with no primer
He's a rhymer a writer he's tighter
He kicks like a striker whose hitting the mitre
He flicks in the cipher n spits like a lighter
You think that your nicer nah he's politer

Its the intro the wee Scottish rapper
Straight from the Burgh so thurgh with the banter
Its the intro the wee Scottish rapper
Spent all his time just trying to find an answer [x2]

Is he Train spotting because he is looking at tracks
The same way Renton be looking at smack
He is a Sick boy mate spitting the raps
No crack mate nah mate this is the crack
He puts needles to tracks right on top of the create
Top writers on the map write on top of the page
Got topics for days but the topic that stays
Is the one trying to get to a tropical stage
See we all want to make it its basic to hate it
Some say they dont but face it they chased it
Only to get knocked right back and cant take it
And he just depends on the pen he wont waste it
Its like he raves it he does it with ease
Whole time he does it he just does as he please
Loved to make money but does it for free
Admit it mate no one really does it like he

You cant understand him but cant over stand him
Shops wont sell them cause he stole and they banned him
Left him abandoned him and his band and
Made him take a seat cause they just couldnÂ’t stand him
He had gigs the mans up he manned up
But they laughed like the cunt was doing stand up
Walked up to the bar saying bars suck
Throwing shit on the stage when he said throw your hands up
Set half cut cause he's half cut
Fucking up his lines like coke when its half cut
This is hard work and if it dont work
He would be lying if he said that it dont hurt

Its the intro the wee Scottish rapper
Straight from the Burgh so thurgh with the banter
