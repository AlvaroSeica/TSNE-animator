[Intro: Ice Cube]
did you get your Race Card
I did get my Race Card
did you get your Race Card
hell no, I did get my Race Card
did you get your Race Card
home boy when you get your Race Card
did you get your Race Card
white boy, what is the Race Card

[Chorus: Ice Cube X2]
please don't believe the hype
everything in the world ain't black and white
everybody ain't the stereotype
just because I look wrong, I'ma bout to do right

[Ice Cube]
black as midnight, or bright as snow white
better do me right or I have to take flight
put you on ice, blast on you twice
if you a Zipper better come out them stripes
just cause I'm dressed like I'm straight outta jail
make more money than them white boys are yell
and got more cents than your fuckin' president
that College graduate, he can't pay his rent
but don't call me brother man
unless your ass got my money in your other hand
pull that black man shit, that white man shit
but, see your suit and tie, are still get your ass looks so nice
cause I never my Race Card in the mail
is that the reason why my life still hard as hell
I been to jail, just like Martha Stewart
and both told the judge that we didn't do it...

[Hook: Ice Cube]
did you get your Race Card
hell no, I did get my Race Card
did you get your Race Card
everybody, show me your Race Card
did you get your Race Card
yo, what the hell is the Race Card
did you get your Race Card
could any body tell me what is the Race Card

[Chorus: Ice Cube X2]
please don't believe the hype
everything in the world ain't black and white
everybody ain't the stereotype
just because I look wrong, I'ma bout to do right

[Hook: Ice Cube]
did you get your Race Card
did you get your Race Card
did you get your Race Card
did you get your Race Card

[Chorus: Ice Cube X2]
please don't believe the hype
everything in the world ain't black and white
everybody ain't the stereotype
just because I look wrong, I'ma bout to do right

[Outro: Ice Cube]
did you get your Race Card
did you get your Race Card
did you get your Race Card
did you get your Race Card</pre>
