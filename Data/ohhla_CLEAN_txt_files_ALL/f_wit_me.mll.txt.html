[Intro: DJ Drama] + (Tory Lanez)
Most of us successful people, could tell you a story
about when they wasn't fuckin' with us {"MeKanics"}
Now that we're at the top, y'all not fuckin' with us!
(They ain't fuck with me when my money low)
(Now they tryna ride cause my money long)
Feel me? T. Lanez, Meek Milly (my money long)

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
These niggas ain't shit, half a million dollar whip, nigga
Tell your bitch suck a rich nigga dick
They may hate like I ain't grind for this shit
But I ain't trippin' cause you niggas ain't fuckin' with me...
Tell 'em "Nah, nah you niggas ain't fuckin' with me..."
Nah...

[Meek Mill]
Yeah, when the money came all the hoes came too (too)
And these niggas started hatin', I guess that's what fame do (did)
And I remain who? (Me!) Still be with the same crew
None of my niggas don't fall out for bitches, they fallin' for money, no we ain't you
We ain't y'all niggas; started with a dollar
and I turned that to a million (milly) now the Chasers in the building
It ain't hard nigga; I'm like oh Lord what a feeling
when you pull up, drop the ceiling on them suckers that was watchin'
while we starve nigga (starve nigga) they got fat, and I got slim (slim)
So I shitted on them niggas, when I got in (in)
My homie caught me for some paper, they was not my friends (never)
They was not my dawgs now we fuck that niggas now come on (BLRRRT~!)
More money than you can ever think (think)
Now we buying more PJ than we can ever drink (drink)
More than we could ever swallow (swallow) get money that's my motto (motto)
When you in the lead there's nothing to follow - I know...

[Chorus]

[Meek Mill]
Uh, when the money came all the problems came too (too)
And when the problems came all they had to blame was you (you)
And niggas said I changed, you would probably change too (you would)
When niggas is hatin', they catchin' them vapors and mad at favors that you ain't do
They gon' switch sides; I could tell you suckers want me gone
Before I let my mama mourn
You know I'mma let that shit fly; and I used to get it on
Sellin' crack til it was dawn, movin' fish
and I ain't talkin' bout no fish fry; and the reason they can't keep up
cause when they sleep you know we up, we move kilos, then re-up
I do one lap, then I speed up with your plan A you couldn't be us
Or see us, when it's game time, and it's 4th quarter now let's D up
I'mma be up, with my feet up, and I'mma eat up, every beat up
That they feed us, as a fetus; I had more stripes, than Adidas
And my dawg told me don't ease up, kill these niggas
And when I do murder them all me and my Philly niggas - YEAH!

[Chorus]

[Outro: DJ Drama]
I'm on a decade of dominatin' the game
with the legends, the hottest MCs, and the new niggas
It's me! They ain't fuckin' wit me
It's the ball, +DC 3+, get ya dreams out</pre>
