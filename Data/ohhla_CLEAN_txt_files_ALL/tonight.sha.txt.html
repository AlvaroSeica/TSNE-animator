[Shabaam Sahdeeq]
Yeah...
We never come up short, we drop the hits
Born to spit, y'all better warn the kids
That we out to stop all that boring crap
We out to sweep all y'all off the mat
Y'all weak like baby arms can't hold the gat
I'm 'posed to rep, straight Eastcoast connect
No frozen necks, it's doo-rags and baggy sweats
and Jordan kicks, don't slip we'll snatch ya chick
Pull off in the Cherokee and shit with me
Outta state, believe me I'ma stuff her face
You soft like cake, talk loud but run to jakes
What does it take, to let you know I'm one of a kind?
Sinister Sounds, watch how the kid get down
I'm here to stay, got free like _Amistad_
See through ya facade, see that you tryna be hard
While I strike ya bitch with the light in the box
You back for more, like crackheads bangin my door
Scratchin my wall, your crew bound to fall
I'm on my job, make it clear to y'all
That I got, no care no fear for y'all
Numerous bars, that'll leave numerous scars
Numerous cons, that'll bring numerous peeps
to stomp the street, stomp ya fleet, ya can't compete
S-Double break the beat, who want beef?

YO! YO! YO! YO!

[Hook]
We gon' tear shit down tonight
We gon' bag some chicks, get laid tonight
We gon' get some green and choke tonight
We gon' get some drinks, get drunk tonight, come on
[repeat]

YO! YO! YO! YO!

[Shabaam]
Ask around, who rhymes like a half a pound?
Crack ya crown, bleed when I lay you down
It's grimey now, fuck around get stomped out
So just chill -- them hoes tryna party now
When morning crow they ask what, where, and how
The most improved, SS fit in the groove
I'm spittin atchu, them cats don't wanna listen to you
You ain't hot while I'm like a boilin pot
It's underground, crack like a thunder sound
We plunder pal, wonder how we lock shit down
You ain't a thug, you fake like a Wallaby Lug
No apologies when I throw that slug
Raw for sure, mames when I kick in the door [*starts fading*]
I'm stickin ya whore, grab mics; blazed and torn
The chick; she laid out and she ready for more...
