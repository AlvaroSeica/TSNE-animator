[Intro]
Hey! {*14X*}

[Travie McCoy]
Listen babe I think it's time for me
to come clean; I mean I haven't been the most faithful
And I don't know how else to say this plain and simple
I been cheatin believe me this isn't easy especially
since you've been so good to me
The hardest thing I've ever done is tellin you you're not the only one
Just understand this, you made a man outta ignorance and
like a boy I toyed with innocence
This double life's not worth livin, not givin more to her and I apologize

[Chorus]
And it's all part of the game
It's just the same old thing with a different name
And we can try and drown the pain
but we both swim too well to submerge ourselves
And I'm tired of the shame
of bein the fool too cool to mantain two dames
And all I need is time
Please forgive me darling, the blame's all mine

[Travie McCoy]
When I come home to you with open arms, insist on pressin on my overcoat
the alcohol and stale cigarette smoke
I know you've been skeptical, I play it off like you're delusional
The fact is that I'm losin you, and I'm scared
she doesn't want me, the way I need her to know
She doesn't want me, the way I need her to
I'm pleading with the judge on my knees
God please just make these charges go away

[Chorus]

[Travie McCoy]
Girl I promise I'll do my best to impress the jury
Cause when the smoke settles, and one of us falls to the dirt
It was worth all of the hurt - and if not
let's cut our losses cause you crossed the line
Thinkin I'd choose you over music~? That's just stupid
This whole situation's bogus, especially since I'm so focused
From begining to the end, are we enemies or friends?
Unfortunatley this is hopeless
Did my best to juggle both of you
Struggled but I'm still here holdin you
Tie the man up, stand up, put your hands up
if you understand what I'm goin through

[Chorus]</pre>
