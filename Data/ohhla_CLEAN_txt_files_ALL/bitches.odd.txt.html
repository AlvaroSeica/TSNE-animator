[Intro]
Bitch~! Haha

[Domo Genesis]
It's the five-nine taper fade; Sideline Laker game
High Times save a page; they already know the name
It's Doms in this bitch; I mean it's real shit takin place
Money still the motive and I'm clockin it like Flavor Flav

[Hodgy Beats]
Let me take my scarf off, 5-4-3-2-1 bitch
Hodgy bout to barf logs, I be spittin fire
Campin makin s'mores; my flow be trampin like you whores
I'm suicidal fuck the door, I'm and if but and or

[Domo Genesis]
Bitch; what the fuck is you talkin' bout if you ain't gettin no money huh?
Broke niggaz just talkin loud, I swear you niggaz is funny bruh
We what the fuck is up, twenty-twelve, clutch as fuck
Fast lifestyle nigga slow me down double cup

[Hodgy Beats]
Old school visions, rhyme ambidextrous I switch hands
5 o'clock when yo' bitch landm by 6 she will be quicksand
Who better than the next nigga? This man
Pockets swell up like a sick gland killing your whole ambition.. bitch!

[Domo Genesis]
My hat says high cause that's exactly how I feel bitch
All I need is green grass, and gold on my real bitch
Watch me get it nigga, I'ma sell it real quick
Hodgy drew the master plan and Domo hit the kill switch

[Hodgy Beats]
I'm young fellow guy, peddle by, reppin MellowHigh
Girlfriend never settles why? Too busy in the, meadows high
Out to 'Dena, I'm fresh like I'm out the cleaners
Hard wood like an angry beaver, I'm nuts like my fuckin t-shirt - get it?

[Domo Genesis]
A Phantom you never hand a random rapper eatin cannibal
She can't refuse so I let her drink it like it's Danimals
Handsome dude she wanna be with standing by camera crews
I let her snooze and dream, cause none of them wishes tangible

[Hodgy Beats]
I'm ballin like Benjamin, it's all about the Benjamins
That's why people acknowledge me and I ain't even friends with them
Call a hoe then stall a hoe, I'm also dope across the rope
Catch my fate I bang grenades and beat your face 'til it's off your throat

[Domo Genesis]
Please shut the fuck up; let me put this shit to sleep
The shit he speak, got him all antsy like it's Christmas week
Silly me, riding with several bitches with slim physiques
And I'm tryin to see "Lights, Cameras, Action" like Mr. Cheeks

[Hodgy Beats]
Army.. fatigue, Bape boxes for the league
No ghetto barettes and weaves, down to the sleeve for the fees
If packaged she'll be petite, know how to roll up my weed
Her doing's doin the deed, and she don't really need shit

[Domo Genesis]
They asking Domo "where you been?" They feel they got ditched
Just look for the influence I be under that bitch and
It's a headlock when it come to that grip
You ain't never met a muh'fucker done it that sick

[Hodgy Beats]
I'm the best thing yet, I'm the best thing next
I bet I'll mess with pre-sets and jet around all these vets
That don't know how to let go; this game is filled with a bunch
of grey haired dead souls, promise 90 retro, hoe!!

[Domo Genesis]
Hey y'all, get out of he way cause I'm goin AWOL
Bitch lay off the gas that they givin your head tank dog
Thinking that you better than me'll get you taped off
You either gotta win or go home, bitch it's the playoffs

[Hodgy Beats]
More luxurious that a throwback with no lo-jack
No driver but it got doormats, zero to sixty in like fo' flat
You know any nigga that own that?
I ain't stuntin, I'm a youngin, me and my niggaz we be thuggin
At our shows that we be buggin, groupie loving and we buzzin

[Domo Genesis]
So meet me in the trap; it's goin down
MellowHigh leanin like the jaw of Bobby Brown

[Hodgy Beats]
Cops arrest me for a DUI prohibition
We don't need y'all motherfuckers to stop and listen
Golf Wang bitch!</pre>
