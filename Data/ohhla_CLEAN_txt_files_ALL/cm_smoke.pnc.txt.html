Now some might snort some Peter and
Some might snort some Rum
But this here is an mother fuckin'
Weed song

[Kangol Slim]
Come smoke ah
Come smoke with me bleh
I am the one yes me do get the weed
Come smoke ah
Come smoke with me bleh
I am the one yes me do get the weed
I say I'm smokin' up on the blunt
Yes me smoke it every day
Smoke one or two down to the end
We smokin' up on the blunt
Yes we smoke it every day
Smoke one or two down to the end
Every body is chillin' in the party
Blowin' the manja weed
If you ask them what there smokin'
Then they all we reply and say
It's a pleasure to be 
Smokin' an Swisha Sweet     
For the boy's who cool
Smokin' bags of food yeah
Oh me like 
To smoke on a blunt
Me do smokin' blunts and
Me do not stunt
On me kick it up on this Reggae style
Me like to kick it cause is bunch a wild
I'm Up Early N Tha Mornin'
My blunt get my mornin' yawnin'
Up Early N Tha Mornin'
My blunt get my mornin' yawnin'
We smokin' up on the blunt
Yes we smoke it every day
Smoke one or two down to the end
We smokin' up on the blunt
Yes we smoke it every day
Smoke one or two down to the end
Come smoke ah
Come smoke with me bleh
I am the one yes me do get the weed
Come smoke ah
Come smoke with me bleh
I am the one yes me do get the weed</pre>
