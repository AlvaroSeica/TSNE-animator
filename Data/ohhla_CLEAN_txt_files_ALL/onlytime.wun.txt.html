Yes Yes Yes, It's the Live Wunz once again

[Flawless]
You heard us, the street *niggaz* rockin' the piece
Flava for Ninety-Nine, Lyricly greased
No MC could ever infiltrate this, Cause we a tight
Team, And we thoughtfully spaced this
Throughout New York, Cali, and Over Seas
We the illest of *niggaz*, a new breed

[Theif]
A crook wit a deal thas layin' up flava
*Fuck* the broke *shit*, Ya'll better start stackin' paper
When Live Wunz step up, We hold it down, Flow for ever
And pussy ass crew can't even keep their attention or whatever
Mack the 10's, and Nine the Mili's
We just a big clan of *assed* out broke willies
No matter what goes on, Theif continually *shit* down
I'm consistent on the road or in my home town

[Dodger]
I rhyme and do time, Thas the story of my life
I record hot tracks, and I'm sentenced for life
But naw son, I ain't goin' out like dat yo
I show love for my street people, And straight up pimp the *ho's*
When I bring rhymes, Hardcore can't even describe them shits
Peep my demo, I was banned in fifty states for it
My life seem to be headed in a one way direction
With no possibility for change and no time for repension

[Chorus: Lauryn Hill Singing]
Only Time Will Tell
How everything ends up tonight
Only Time Will Tell
If we all will be all right
Only Time Will Tell
The Path we choose and we're it takes us
Only Time Will Tell
Those who are true, And those who will break us

[Free]
Ay-o the coolest, wildest, nicest cat
With a stack of cash, and a twenty-four carrot gold gat
New York For Life, I'm *fuckin'* representin'
I got four houses already, The fifth I'm currently erectin'
The illest emcees, and thugged out entertainers
Don't fuck wit us, I mean thas a no brainer
Comrad Free, Patriot of N-Y-C
A Zealot for life, Illin' wit da L-I-V-E

[Slim Pete]
Cashin' checks and coppin' fly rides
Live Wunz ain't got no limit but the sky
Slim Pete favorite cut, *Fuck* the police
Not by NWA, the unreleased cut by Big L and C-Pece
You know P keep it real with the streets
Fuck original, I'll rap over anybody's beats
I'm the Illest in New York
More fabolous the sport
And *fuck* *¯This rhyme is blurred on all releases¯*

[Chorus: Lauryn Hill Singing]
Only Time Will Tell
Only Time Will Tell
Only Time Will Tell

[Ribb I]
Figure Eight through the hood, I'm the best
*Fuck* just really good
Rollin' with the catz that go by the name the Live Wunz
Rhyme spitters, Heavy Hitters, The *fuckin'* crazy ones
I pull weight, *Fuck* pushin' it
What strenght does that take
Plus when I'm finished a cook you like a Lonestar Steak

[Lauryn Hill]
Victims of Insanity, Brain washed with seductive Vanity
Life of refugees in America
Cause corruption, conspiracy, and conflict between them and me
Is my miseducation to blame for all this
Or am I just a lost girl
With a lost mind and *¯Blurred¯*

[Chorus: Lauryn Hill Singing]
Only Time Will Tell
How everything ends up tonight
Only Time Will Tell
If we all will be all right
Only Time Will Tell
The Path we choose and we're it takes us
Only Time Will Tell
Those who are true, And those who will break us
Only Time Will Tell
How everything ends up tonight
Only Time Will Tell
If we all will be all right
Only Time Will Tell
The Path we choose and we're it takes us
Only Time Will Tell
Those who are true, And those who will break us</pre>
