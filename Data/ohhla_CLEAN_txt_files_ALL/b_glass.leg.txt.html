[Eligh]
Can you see yourself not seeing yourself?
That's the question

If I paint the back of a sheet of glass black
What I have is so complex
You can never make your way back
To vanity instilled in children
Filling villains with the greatest weapon of all time
A connection to your outer layers and mind, body and soul
Could never conceive
Or believe in a world without a mirror image
It's a mere scrimmage when the mirror has two faces
And you can't figure out which face is yours
How would the world function
If you didn't know which race was yours?
You could take a face and, like, make it yours
Make hate dissipate
If the way to take notice to your physical
Existed in a lake or a stream
In a dream or a tear on a cheek (cheek, cheek)

[Scarub]
If there were no mirrors on the walls
All along the halls
And hallways and pathways and shortcuts and back ways
And alleyways and corners or lobbies and concession stands
And along the ceilings in grocery stores
And at newsstands and restaurants and bathrooms
And backrooms and living rooms and churches
Where work is, where birth is
In hospitals and hotels and banks
A lot less would be seen
You would have gotten away
She would've been a victim
I would have been charged
And locked behind bars
Wishing there were mirrors on walls
All along the halls
And hallways and pathways and shortcuts and back ways
And alleyways and corners and lobbies and concession stands
And along the ceilings in grocery stores

[Sunspot Jonz] [CHORUS] X 2
You can't stop it all
Some things must fall
You made it that way
'Til it all blows away

[Eligh]
Can you see yourself not seeing yourself
Unless you're looking into the sea
Or you're seeing someone else
Who talks in the same tone
Or walks with a similar step
When you're picking up the paper
And the morning dew is wet
Or playing in a game and some fool is dripping sweat
Or you're bending over a glass table
Putting down your bet
On a world with an obsession over attributes so set
On a physical vehicle decorated, displayed from the get-go
Get low esteem, add it with DNA and traits
Then you can say the hate for self exposes in reflections
Get low esteem, add it with DNA and traits
Then you can say the hate for self expresses in reflections

[Scarub]
No clear views or rear views
Freeways would be overcrowded with fender-benders
And middle fingers would be thrown up in faces
As common as compact mirrors can be found in purses
Life would be the worstest, or would it be a remedy?
No more seven years bad luck for breaking the reflective glass
More productivity
Women wouldn't be running back and forth in bathrooms to refreshen that ass
Less time and money would be wasted on
Pathetic cosmetic merchandise made to entice
And glamour girls would have ???
And Michael Jackson would still be black, ya know?

You made it that way
'Til it all blows away

I will not stare if you will not talk
I will not stare if you will not talk
I will not stare if you will not talk
I will not stare if you will not talk

[CHORUS] X 2

I will not stare if you will not talk
I will not stare if you will not talk
I will not stare if you will not talk
I will not stare if you will not talk

"Let's take a drink
Nobody's watching"
"Yeah"
"A small one won't hurt us
Whoops!"</pre>
