Intro: (sung)
Livin' in a
Livin' in a Hoe House

[Verse 1]
First, let me tell you where the hoes are located
L.A. Encino, the place is X rated
Fucking with a real pimp, Sugar Daddy D
Pimping fine bitches selling plenty CDs
Livin' in a Hoe House, you've got to have game
A weak ass bitch will go insane
The Feds roll in and raid the place
Suck his dick so you won't get a case
But like Al Capone, our pimps stand strong
Fuck with a hoe, your ass is gone
But I'm moving on, gone, as I flow real strong
I'm getting paid while your daddy's getting laid
When he first stopped by, he thought it was a joke
Your daddy came back, now his ass is broke
True hard hustlers that might fuck your spouse
'Cause we love our life Livin' in a Hoe House

chorus:(sung)
Livin' in a Hoe House
Livin' In A Livin' In A
Livin' in a Hoe House
Oh A Hoe House

[Verse 2]
Bitch, you want to talk about me, try to diss me
'Cause I'm living large, driving 300 E
Rodeo Drive and the Beverly Center
Check the records, no we ain't beginners
We're known coast to coast, never brag or boast
But most of all, I ain't no fucking joke
I'm in total control making suckers unfold
It's not in December, but I'm too damn cold
'Cause my pimp producer, Dangerous D
Is pimping funky tracks for the Hoes and me
So give me that mic so I can recite
The dopest lyrics, no you can't come near it
Too many niggaz talking they hard
But they wouldn't bust a grape in Welch's back yard
See, hoes like us keep your dick aroused
'Cause that's the life Livin' in a Hoe House

chorus:
(2X)

[Verse 3]
500 SL we living large as hell
Jaz locked up with $50,000 bail
But we didn't phase that, sent them the ends
Now we got Jaz back
'Cause we respect no chaser
Suck his dick like eraser
Now dig the aroma
Now savor the bass H.W.A.
Keep a smile on your face
Put your money up
Selling more pussy than Kellog's got flakes
24/7 working all through the year
Fuck all that shit, I'm 'bout to hop in my Lear
With your spouse
'Cause that's the life Livin' in a Hoe House

Chorus:
(2X)</pre>
