[Vast Aire]
My mother said you sucked my pussy when you came out
Don't ever talk back
I handled your life and I'll snatch it back
I'm just a latch key kid wit a snotty nose
High school drop out, space I'm around need white-out
And I ain't dealing with no minimum wage
I'd rather construct rhymes on a minimal page
Cynical ways, cats sin for nickels these days
Pulling the chrome out, and your acting like pulling the chrome out(?)
Hated the sound of grandma's crying, a crooked letter 
You could hear it from the ground or where the sky thunders
Make you wonder bout early Sunday mornin'
Relatives dressed in black and they all mournin'
Flows be banging in the paint throwing elbows
My first fight was me against five boroughs
I lost my first wish
But remembered every detail of my first kiss
That's that Bronx tale bliss
The holiest of holies, hip-hop, it was eighty-eight
Even at the age of ten, phrases levitate
Drinking little ?hug? quart of waters
Dodging stray slugs on the corner, in that exact order
While you plan death is what happens
I found a passion to aerosol cans and hands clappin'
Backspins, microphones, and cats rapping
Linoleum, and up-rockers, the show shockers
Who ripped lee patches off of imposters
You ain't the real McCoy, you a wind up toy
And it's gonna cost ya
And that's my B-Boy Alpha

[Vordul Megala]
Straight outta the depths of Hell
Reflect a sec and inhale a Buda wisdom
Envision in added description of a Megala spiritualism
Paint a picture from the spiritual
And seriously spit a lyric that'll rip through a physical ligament
Trigger living in these city limits
Limited with no money, going through crazy minutes
Crazy thinkin', of back in the day wit blazing a lazy written
Before we was swallowing deuces, popping wit gooses
And rocking the bubble-gooses, trouble loose kid
Puffing a loosey, hopping of Huffys
Stealing Marvel comics and water uzis
All of us cold moving thru sewers with juvenile maneuvers
Caught up in nooses from borders with trouble shooters
Or corners with coppers that hop outta Dunkin' Donuts
Poppin' they gun and shoot us
So more of us aware, thinkin' Rudy Giuli.
Realy don't give a fuck about a mooley
Got me woozy sippin' Kahulas
Loosing my noodle, screwed up into two triple losers 
Sprayin' a live b-boy graffiti alpha "How-Ta-Rap-Palooza"</pre>
