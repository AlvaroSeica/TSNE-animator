[Kid Kaos]
I can't take the highway to heaven, I'll take the backroad to hell
If you can't find me - I'm locked up in my brain cells
Lookin' for the best of my thoughts
See my mind is like a plantation and my thoughts are the crop
No I can't stop - I have to reach the epidemy
Love for those who with me, fuck those who against me
I treat each rhyme like as if it had it's own identity
I never let any negativity get to me
I say what a believe with a little bit of confidence
Satutarious, sarcastic - ain't it obvious?
Ain't no need to fear though - I'm here to save hip-hop
'Cause y'all are yesterday heroes!

[Chorus]
*When I be on the mic*, *I'm representin'!*
You god damn right!

[Kid Kaos]
I'm here to kill the MC's and knock 'em off balance
You try to cause malice, but you really no challenge
Step up to me, I got the best weaponry
That creeps up behind you and kill unexpectedly
No time to think, my freestyles are sporadic
The best acrobatic, punchlines make contact
With your mind, break your bones on the inside
Pullin' out every single vein one at a time
No line you have can fuck with my syntax
I bend backs, pay you to the back on contact
It's more like a heist, the way I take your life
Never nice, to the decimal unprecise

[Chorus]
*When I be on the mic*, *I'm representin'!*
You god damn right!

[Kid Kaos]
Aiyo I'm something to brag about
When I'm finished with a freestyle battle I have to drag 'em out
Oh I thought you know bro
Me and my M-P-C always get the award for best duo
Vintage Imperial nobody above it
You hate the way I love it - but fuck it
Everybody in my city needs to form alliance
So we can let the whole world know we drop science
Or L sumthin' and get crazy
Buckwild and start replacin' MC's like the girls of Destiny's Child
Been a long time since I've actually seen daylight
Sit myself in a low lit room and write

[Chorus]
*When I be on the mic*, *I'm representin'!*
You god damn right!</pre>
