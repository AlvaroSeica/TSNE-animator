[Intro]
Yeah~! Vinnie Pazienza
Jedi Mind... Block McCloud, Brooklyn Academy
Y'knahmsayin? Philly to Brooklyn all day
Pistolvania... y'all know the fuckin deal
Walk with me then

[Vinnie Paz]
You know that Vinnie spit the flyest shit
I'll burn your body in the fire pit
I told you back in ninety-six about the bio-chip
I guess you didn't feel the God and wasn't buyin it
And now it's time for shit to re-align and coincide with it
I told you how that they would clone a human being
I told you that they share the dough with Europeans
I told you that the CIA trained Bin Laden
And that the Vatican Catholicism been rotten
I told you that the UFO's was real
I told you 'bout the crop circles they designed in the field
Yeah; I tried to teach you about Mumia Jamal
Buy y'all ain't listen to me I'ma see his freedom or fall
I tried to tell you about the real reasons for the war
And how the old administration steal from the poor
And how the world as we know it ain't got much time
I guess that I can't make a difference with just one rhyme

[Block McCloud]
We signed the unsigned, frontline to backdrop
Punchlines are cocaine cooked up to crack rock
Chopped up, distributed, baselines they sniffin it
Place your order, in half a minute delivered it
In 30 seconds feel the dirty weapon in your bloodstream
Like ultraviolet rays penetratin through the sunscreen
Block McCloud rainin down, feel the force of punk king
Vinnie Paz, metaphor, volcanic eruption
Spontaneous combustion, inhale the foreign substance
into your soul, fire in the hole
Higher than the Empire State, while desires to be told
It's the best kept secret like the pyramids in Egypt
Mythic hieroglyphics, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Noah's Ark
Historic blown apart, Napoleon complex
With the biggest bomb threat, atomic nuclear attack
Brooklyn Ac', Jedi Mind Tricks, fuckers read the fine print

[Chorus]
I told you the underground is over now
This the new generation and we hold it down
I told you it's Brooklyn Ac' and Jedi Minds
Ahead of their times, rebels with them devilish rhymes
I told you you don't wanna fuck around
With the boys from the hood that'll stomp you out
I told you these little ones is paper thin
Fucking with heavyweights, please let the games begin

[Brooklyn Academy]
I told you I'm a Baptist, baptize your flock
My flows is greater than Moses, capsize your yacht
My immortal technique will clap nines at cops
Act wise your heart might just, flatline and stop
I told homie I'll sun you like a tannin salon
I warn you it's gon' happen Bin Laden after the bomb
Can't see me i, I'm in caves and caverns
Still my crazed chatter, is engraved inside your brain's grey matter
Send your soul to Jacob's Ladder could've cashed in the tender
Me and Vinnie Pazienza got a plan to make you fags
throw up the flag and surrender, we have an agenda
The Fight Club, got fans that are members, too many cats to remember
Revenge of the nerds, murderous pens in my pocket
Protector look through the optical lens of a toxic avenger
It's the quiet 'fore the storm enjoy the tropical weather
Cause when we pop it's like the nuclear bombs they drop in the desert

[Pumpkinhead]
'Til I achieve my goal, I stay writin in peace alone
Readin scrolls, deeper than anything Jesus knows
See the code, the priest foretold the beast would roam
from offshores of the beach of Rome
A European orphan, three sixes burned in a coffin
For Vatican cashin in they get a piece of all this
Massive building battle stations way out in orbit
Satellites, catchin sights of lifeforms, a priceless poultry
The technology's theirs, the money's corporate
They look humanoid but they talk like they dolphins
The sonic frequency deafens the human ear
I'm not askin you believe, I'm just askin that you adhere
My peers, this info is older than life, it's limitless
How you think Aztecs created sundials and pyramids?
It came from the chariots of fire
The Ac' and Vinnie Paz casts a sentence of death to the truthless liar

[Chorus]

[Outro]
{*laughing*} YEAH!
Crack! Crack!
Vinnie P, Jedi Mind</pre>
