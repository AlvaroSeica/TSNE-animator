Yes sir, once again it's on
Juicy J featuring Project Pat
Chronicles of the Juiceman
North, North Part 2
Raise your thumbs up, my nigg
It's on, fool

(Hook 2x)
North, raise your thumbs up nigga

(Juicy J)
North, north in this thang
And you know we running thangs
Everybody raise your thumbs
Everybody show your gangs
March in a circle man
Muscle up until you strain
Project Pat and Juicy J them niggas 
With them gold fangs
Yes we keep the lightest dope
Yeah we has the freakest hoes
Then we ride to Evergreen
On the block is where we post
Policeman can't stop this
I think they ought to stop it
I'm talking in that ghetto English
Saying fucking bastards
Gangsta, niggas walk up in the club
High as hell, because we full of drugs
What gang you claim, the way they wear them hats
Don't get too close, be careful we be strapped
We put it on the map
We keep out cheese in flaps
And if you see me in the hood
You better give me dap
I'm known as a veteran
My picture should be stamped
From Smoky City to Hollywood, they wild over there, yeah

Hook (2x)

(Project Pat)
If you ain't from my hood
You can get the hell from 'round here
Cause me gon' smoke hydro
And we gon' drank beer
It ain't no mu'fuckin secret
Cause we some thugs
It ain't hard for you to peep it
We sellin drugs
So don't you cowards step wrong
Smith and Wess-on
These automatics have ya ass singing a different song
A mega blast from these rocks get the track jumpin
A North Memphis nigga sell dope or taking something
Your car bumpin', riding clean and you seeming bold
And now you wonder why we kicking in your back door
This ain't no suburb, my nigg this the ghetto
And you gon' come through flossin like a pretty ho
A no no, for you off turn-em-on niggas
Show some love or you will meet then chrome triggers
We smoking buds, sippin sizerp and poppin pills
Gimme some work, come on through
We got the best deals

Hook (2x)

(Juicy J)
I done lived in the North, 'round the way
I done planted playa seeds in the motherfucking bay
Hypnotize is the label that you don't wanna hate
I done seen niggas make it
I done seen niggas break
Brothers on the same block till his hair turn gray
Stilll all about a hustle, punch a clock, no way
The police hit the block, swallow rocks, throw the hay
Back in the same spot, the next fuckin' day
Project Pat, what's up

(Project Pat)
Jimmy, Jimmy coco puff
You know how we roll
Niggas is gone get shot up
Trippin with this North
Ride up beside ya, dawg
Pullin up them Yorks
Squeeze on them triggers
Empty clips and reload
If'n you got beef, my nigga
You better bring it
The hood buck is here
The police couldn't tame it
Inhalin' potent trees
Something you can't hang with
Hydro wit' red hairs
Something I can slang wit'

Hook (8x)</pre>
