(Verse One)
Everytime I pick up a paper or turn on the tube a news flash
another youth passed school ground's a bloodbath
Politicians caught in sex scames
Major sports figures in and out of rehabs
Holy war with Jews and Arabs
Recalls and cutbacks feature story go to those who gay bash
Bolemic and anorexic actors and actresses swappin' secrets on their freakiest fetishses
Pedophile predators on the interent
Numerous reports of preteen sex
30 second updates on side effects of modern medicine
Rap veteren turn convicted felon
Domestic violence rate excellin'
embezzlement the deficit negligence
More serial killings gang related death still in existence
Mosquitoes dead crows and the viruses that they're inflicted
with road rage incidents it's sickenin'

(Hook)
Talk about beautiful things a little bit
Talk about beautiful things a little bit
Talk about beautiful things a little bit
Talk about beautiful things a little bit

(Verse Two)
Jon Benet Ramsey chaos mayhem
Tragedy koslovo victims
Third world country casualties
Phen Phen and Herbalife may not reduce calories
Corporate downsizin' cut wages and salaries rich men catchin bodies get away on technicality
Collogen injection lypo suction plastic surgery
Organized crime bosses depicted as marytars
Child care slaying underage baby aborters
Authorities do search and seize without court orders
Unlawful acts caught on camcorders
Pollutents in the water
Suicide manslaughter father preforming incest on his daughters
Drug lords combatting over street corners
Hit and run arson prey on senior citizens
Gossip columinists feed off lies and who be living 'em
Note to commentator while you at the poduim
present us wit some healthy options

(repeat hook)

(Verse Three)
Media slogan we uphold negative promotion
to pigeon hole attention of the weak and the hopeless
Tellin' lies through vision thinking no one is decodin' it
few who do will get descredited for even noticin
No wonder generation X remains emotionless
misinformed then entertained on ignorance by hyppocrites
Circultaing seediness validated by leadership whoses primary motive is to make the public more obedient
Everybody plays the fool
Sometimes the main ingredient used in ploy confirming what was stated previous
But if the anchor realizes his position is a gift
he'd truly honor what his mission is..
