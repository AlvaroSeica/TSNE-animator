Yo!
Yo.. yo..
I'm back (I'm back)
Slip 'N Slide Records
Yo, yo, yo, yo
Hahaha...
Haters
Yo, uh

Chorus

I'm single again
Back on the prowl
I thought it was perfect
I don't know how

I'm single again
Back on the prowl
I thought it was perfect
I don't know how
I'm single again...

[Trina]
You know how they do, how they act
See you wit' another man, and they want you back
(Whoop! Whoop!) My ass still fat
(Whoop! Whoop!) They still checkin' for me
And never will you find another bitch like me (Like me)
And I don't care what your friends say
What we had was like Jay and Beyonce (Mmm)
Or was it all a dream?
Back seat in the Phantom, sippin' that 'lean
We party like rock stars
We sex like porn stars
I'll sex you a million bars

Chorus

[Trina]
Stop callin' me apologizin, don't even start it
Hope you find what you're lookin' for back on the market
Let's agree to disagree, don't explain shit to me
I got my own money, there's nobody I need.. I need.. I need.. my own space
I'm single again
Who's who I'm minglin' wit
Ball players sendin' seats to the game
Ringside, still doin' my thang
Changed my number, switched my cars up
Six months wit' ya, maxed ya cards up
It all started so promisin'
Got my own diamonds, so I gave him back the promise ring

Chorus

[Trina]
Hold up..
Wait a God damn minute
It ain't over 'til I say we finished
'Til I get my half
Then I sit back, relax and just laugh
At the times we shared
Like flyin' over B'More high in the G4
Smokin' on Cali' bud, that's how a real G show a bitch Cali' love
Sex in the cockpit
No love, I was just another object
You fell in love with my ass
King Magazine, you fell in love wit' my ad
20 G's in the Prada bag - And I'm 'bout to ball out
Had to get my mind right, I'm back in the limelight
Fellas..

Chorus

Diamond Princess, yeah
I'm still the baddest bitch
Hahaha...</pre>
