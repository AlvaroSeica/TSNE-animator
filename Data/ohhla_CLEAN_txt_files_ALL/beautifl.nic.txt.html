[Nicki Minaj]
South Africa is where I come from
Get me my banjo, get me my drum
Kidnap career and don't take ransom
Don't let me come out of my dungeon
Want me to la-leave? Then Tay get it done
True see me come out of England at dawn
True say the pattern come from Kingston
Trinidad Trinidad is my island

[Nicki singing]
I see you in here dancing
Your preview is quite romantic
I envy your perfect kind of life
Who knew, you could be so sexy?
I think you're quite fantastic
Screw your flaws, you're perfect in my eyes

[Chorus]
And maybe I'm naive for lovin you
You're a cheat and a liar but tonight you're everything I desire
You beautiful sinner; I love your wicked heart
Beautiful sinner; it's such a work of art
I didn't know that bad could look so good
You are the type of bad that feels so good - you beautiful sinner

[Nicki Minaj]
I bet you're heart of stone
Living in your world alone
I hope you let me in tonight
They want me, to beware
You're dangerous, I don't care
I can't wait, to have you in my arms

[Chorus]

[Nicki Minaj]
Maybe you're the master of disguise and you are
Put it on and you're really the saint that good one
Are you here to save me from the crowd?
If you are, then baby take me now

[Outro]
Beautiful sinner; I love your wicked heart
Beautiful sinner; it's such a work of art
I didn't know that bad could look so good
You are the type of bad that feels so good - you beautiful sinner</pre>
