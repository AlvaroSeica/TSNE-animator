[Chorus - 2x]
Bitches gon' be bitches, hoes gon' be hoes
Nigga tricks gon' be tricks, cause that's the way shit goes
You either real or you fake, full of love or hate
You either hustle or you struggle, cause it's money to make

[Big Steve]
See I'ma hustle, get my fetty on so I can bubble
These H-Town streets, be a motherfucking struggle
Money got me moving, bout a hundred miles an hour
Fiending for power, can't let my deals go sour
With a fifty round automatic clip, if they tripping
Cop killer bullets slip in your back, if you slipping
I'm ready affiliated nigga, never gon' change
Laff-Tex mafioso, steady moving them thangs

[D-Pac]
Bitch after bitch, hoe after hoe
Here we go I did this rhyme, while knocking down this hoe
She licked my toe, while she sucked my pole
Everybody know, Southside have to roll
In my wide berry roll, blowing smoke out my nose
Catch me jumping out in gator, Versacci clothes
Who knows, if I be a old school pimp with hoes
Fifty six years old, man this game is so cold

[Chorus - 2x]

[Al-D]
Fuck what he say and she say, I'm everyday hustling
Off my ass mashing for the cash, fuck struggling
Back off lock knocking down the block, in the fifth
It's all good in the hood, ain't nobody trying to trip
Paper chasing across the nation, my palms aching not itching
Ain't no faking I'm breaking, thirty six pieces off the chicken
On a mission, fuck the federalie my bitch Sally
Got a cookie in her pussy, serving fiends for my cavi

[Big Pokey]
Nigga bitches gon' be bitches, hoes gon' be hoes
Head shots and red dots, knock a nigga off toes
Wide body Benzos, screens lit on low
Condos in Costa Rica, big face to foe
Mansion do's to clothes, if I choose indo' pools
Plus Caribbean cruise, penthouses with ocean views
We acting fools, breaking the rules me and my trues
We done paid our dues, now let the smoke out the roof

[Chorus - 2x]

[Clay-Doe]
I chose to grind and stay alert, for them no soul busters
If it ain't them 211 strugglers, it's them blue suit dick suckers
But motherfucker my scratch, for my stacks I never trust em
Packing my straps, on attack and ready to haul em
Scud em but I know, that go both ways but that's ok
Laff-Tex flip, with AR's glocks and AK's
Let's take a trip, to Jasper
Looking for a cracker, call you master naw but I'll blast ya

[Mike D]
Make one move, and I'll checkmate ya
Hoes and birds, to bait ya
Laff-Tex uni-bomber, 3rd Ward youngest mayor
Bleeding the block
Rock for rock shut em down, thinking they on top
Starting with kin folks and homies, niggaz that know me
H-Town Southside balling, squash the chat by showing me
Making broads get it, breaking off ten toes
Hitting licks pimping tricks, bringing me c-notes

[Chorus - 3x]

Bitches gon' be bitches</pre>
