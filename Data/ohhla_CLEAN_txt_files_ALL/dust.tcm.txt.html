[The Phanatik]
Who am I? Just a bag of dust puttin' trust in the Most High
Why boast?  I know that I'm nothin'
Huffin' and puffin' someone else's air through my lungs
'Cause everything belongs to the Son
That was hung up on the Cross
Strung up for the lost
Ya'll know they slayed Him
He rose from the grave, came to save, though they played Him
Some hate Him, mocked Him, to the ground His blood spilled
To this day they be dockin' the things that got Him killed
Shrilled and screamed knowing He'd redeem half the planet
How could He stand in  knowing He'd be taken for granted
Disadvantaged became dust just like you and me
Human beings just so He can put His deed at calvary
Now how do we say thanks, better yet check how could He take it
Despising all the shame being plain in sight-naked
Crowned with thorns scorned  by the unrighteous judges
The King's arms expands shook hands with death's clutches
Seal the deal kill one for all called it grace
Meaning the Supreme Being would die in our place
He was rich and became poor so that we through His poverty
Could become rich hit the lottery
Pottery is all I am in the hands of the maker
Just a custom of dust and plus the salt from the shaker
Meek and lowly Jesus preach we be holy
I gotta give the props to the potter who molds me
'Cause dust...
[Chorus]
Dust is all I am that's what I come from. Taken from the dust
Dust is what I am that's what I come from.  You and me from the dust
Dust is all I am that's what I come from.  God breathed from the dust
Dust is all I am that's what I come from.  True indeed from the dust
Dust is all I am that's what I come from.  It's you and me from the dust
Dust is all I am that's what I come from.  Would you believe from the dust
Dust is what I am that's what I come from.  Every human being from the dust
Dust is all I am that's what I come from

[The Phanatik]
I can't lose I refuse to choose death over life
I was done in then had a run in with Christ
Now I'm freed  what made Him bleed  and cling  to a tree
And get nailed to the form of a lower case t?
No beatin' around the bush the Rose of Sharon got crowned with thorns
And was risen up on a third day morn
Now it's on, for anyone who's got the time of day
Let Him change ya act and ya scene just like a drama play
I'ma say  it once, twice, even a thousand times
Every day of the year Jesus Christ be my valentine
Who's standin' on faulty ground?
If you ain't down then be salty now
(Tell me) What do you see when you close your eyes?
What do you see when your life goes by?
Question for your next session  with your cypha'
Eternal lifa' who's God bring's it hypa'
Is it the God who spoke that spark this?
Reached into the abyss with His fist and pulled light out of darkness
Mark this day and walk this way
You want eternal life (well) then you ain't got no cost to pay (why?)
'Cause Christ paid it all when His blood flooded the streets
In the 199's with the ruggedest beats
We gets biz like show
So 'ey G. act like ya know
Tell me yo what made Him pay the debt that you owe
Was it love? Unlike this world has ever seen before
Born I guess on the flesh that was torn
Mourn for the Bright and the Morning Star who died for you
'Father forgive them for they know not what they do'  (ooh true)
You're missin' His touch I tell ya this much
He thirsted, cursed it, vinegar upon some hyssop
Now there's ever livin' water come place ya order
I'll pour out my spirit upon your sons and your daughters
Before the times up come line up by the creek
And bathe in the blood of the lamb as it leaks
God speaks to dust and it becomes man
Then He breathes on us and we become dust again
'Cause Dust

[Chorus]
