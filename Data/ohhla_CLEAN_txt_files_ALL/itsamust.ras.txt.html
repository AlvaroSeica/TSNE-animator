[Rasaq]
Whew
When it comes to makin' dough, who gon stop it
If money had arms and sockets, it climb in my pocket
It's Rasaq back on the block, back in the drop
Watch ya good hop back on my jock, uh uh
I'll make slugs, hop back in the gat
When it click clack, nigga hop back on ya back
If ands or buts, no tricks tramps or sluts
Just princess cuts, from the wrist and up
I get the bucks like, it's a must
Yep, I pick up chicks, in them pick up trucks
Syke, I sit in whips, and dismiss sluts
N less she cute, and got a big thick butt
You better off with a one minute man
If you think for one minute, you gon get some money mam
It's Rasaq, they call me consamity sam
Put the chopper in the air, it go blamity blam
And the ladies call me, the family man
Cuz I got a sedan, the size of a family's fan
I ride like a toddler
I sit low on them big wheels, but no my car is much larger
And it make ya garage look a lot smaller
It's like tryna feed a soda machine a silver dollar
Chickens folla, will I holla
Nope, not today not tomorrow
Go to the bank, but it's not to borrow
It's to feed my wallet bread, open swallow
I'm so cold I could see my own breath
So far ahead of myself, I can see my own death
Drank wit the right, shake dice wit the left
When two wrongs don't make a right, like claudet and wyclef
Haha get it, two wrongs don't make a right
But it took too long, to make ya wife look at the ice
Goods hop around, on pogo sticks
Just to get wit the color changin' logo click
She wanna sit, in the lolo whip
And she so so thick</pre>
