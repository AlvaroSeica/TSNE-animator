Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Oh my God, man
What the fuck is going on, man?
I can't feel my fucking face, dude
I can't feel my fucking face, dude
Oh my God, oh my God!
Mom, mom!

2pac back, 2pac dead, see I ain't put a price on his head
Walk with a motherfuckin knife by my leg, woke up with a couple dikes in the bed
Random nigga but like it don't care, rainman holed all up in the head
I'm so big, don't knock with the mess, back hand hoes and I'm out with they friend
Okay, Jarren, sweep the leg, basket list and easter eggs
The cameraman take that danger, she don't need them, I'm gonna keep the head
Murder, murder, kill, kill, atleast that's what the reaper said
And I know why I'd rather save these bullets and make you eat the lead
Get it? I said, eat the lead
Hit a motherfucker with the infrared
There my bad man link for it, sneak in niggas, you ain't affair
Go home, nig', best knock us neat, and you bitch will be in the band
Call that bitch, meant the brand, that's 'cause hard names melt the brand
What's the hard need won't if you don't? I said, than I'm gonna lent my brake
Shot myself in the leg, look down at it then it bled
I didn't need that piece so I cut it off and threw it in the shed
Yes, I got five mighters on my hand, bitch, I'm no kid the friend
Two, girl, but I got a rule, girl, that I go through you bitch when I do you
I'm gonna leave you next time I see ya, I will act like I never knew ya
Call from cuba back to the future, then I scuba dive in aruba
With two losers bitch I'm cooler, Jarren Benton, a ruler
You're stuck in a piece like Luda, bitch, I'm about my good up
Yes, I fuck that hoes and we get ice cream on some brusters
Bitch, I'm stuck in this small and I might just rip your spine now
Grown up as same dope and fucked up Amy Winehouse
I'm out, sike back in, mac ten, I make you do a fucking back spin
Sipping coke and cab
Diable, slam the motherfucker in the trashcan
Legend in the making, bitches wanna rape 'em
White boys' mad, 'cause I free based with Kevin Bacon
Shout out to my chick and eating niggas down in megan
And if these niggas sleeping, we're about to wake 'em
I got hoes on my dick, don't you think that's sick?
Why? Bitch, literally, I got hoes on my dick
Jumping out on cobra starships wanna start
Shit, I'm a punch a hole in your chest, rip out your fucking heart and beat it
Rap game's anargon, got these niggas panicking
Whoop a nigga's ass and I ride wid 'em in the ambulance
I'm I'll enough to blow a hole in my dick
And this is just the intro, so niggas, know that I'm sick

Oh my God, oh my God!
Mom, mom! Mom!
