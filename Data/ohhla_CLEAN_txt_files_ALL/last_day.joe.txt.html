[Joe Budden]
Look, look
These niggaz lied to me way back, said this is where my buck stop
Ridin right by in that fly shit, these niggaz still at that bus stop
You won't ever see these jeans sag, you would think so with this tucked Glock
And any nigga wanna go bar-for-bar, know I'm always with that club-hop
This Joe shit, y'all don't know shit, them hoes you with is just average
This fo' spittin that whole clip and my alibi is my bad bitch
So don't be the first to get it
My life is like a movie and yo' bitch deserve the credit
I just stood there and directed
She just did what I expected, doin me but you'd do me too
I'll be me my nigga you be you, I guess that men can be groupies too
Recognize a winner, live like a born sinner
Catered dinners, finna have a pool party in the winter
Finna skinny dip, bitch fuck them drawers, her brains are killer, and I love 'em all
Says my head got a price on it, she'd come through and just suck it off
... So if you scared get a weapon
Every day a nigga live like he prepared for armageddon

[Chorus: Joe Budden]
Now when they call me to them gates and they ask me how I live
I feel like I ain't have a choice like my stomach's to my ribs
Niggaz wanted me dead, I kept hammers in the crib
But naw, I don't regret a fuckin thing I ever did
So I - spend like it's my last day, club like this my last day
Ride like this my last day, fry like this my last day
Fuck like it's my last day, fuck boys wanna blast me
This might be yo' last day, this won't be my last day

[Juicy J]
Yes sir! Juicy J
Joe Budden, let's get it

Uhh, models by my side (side) shooters on my team (team)
Choppers with the beam (beam) countin up some green (green)
Blowin on a blue dream (dream)
My life is like a movie and yo' bitch just made a scene
Me and yo' bitch just made a scene
Wake up and I smoke somethin, after that, I poke somethin
Bet she bad with a fat ass, beat it up like she stole somethin
Fuck two times then I roll somethin, can't no nigga do like me
All my chains is icy, all my clothes is pricey
In Louis Vuittons, no Nikes; I'm Nino Brown, you Ice-T
Snitchin equals dead bodies - snitchin equals dead bodies
Nigga caught a death wish, think he caught me slippin
I don't play that +Bull+ boy, I'm shootin like Scottie Pippen {*blam*}

[Chorus]

[Lloyd Banks]
Uhh, I'm dressed up with my sport keys, my Roley bands, love short sleeves
Wanted man when I toss seeds, all my bitches cross-breeds
These big faces talk G's, I lace my H's, walk, flee
I'm V-6'in in V-12's, '93 is my horse fee
Life's a bitch I figured I'd bone, smoke this weed when I get a little dome
Black star when it's all said and done, gotta put my name in the middle of the road
Open boxes, a pair a day, mine don't come in pearl yet
I got a party out in U.K., I'ma hit them hoes with my Euro step
Insomniac, gotta live my life, where's the pie? I gotta get my slice
I homi' shit, where's the body bag? Kiss my Maserati ass
Two thick queens in the king's suite, get energized off thin sleep
I let all my A.K.A.'s hit, they thought I was ten deep
Miss wait me get a $100 tip, pray to God heard my number and I hit
Jovy girl make 'em come in from the chip, when you do good all the summers go quick
Trust nobody, got thunder on the hip, shotty in the crib, don't start no shit
Bad chick, ass and her stomach don't fit, know your lane, don't come with no lip!

[Chorus]</pre>
