[Intro: Mike Shinoda] + (DJ Green Lantern)
Yo... you ready to do this? Okay
Hahaha, c'mon! Let's go!
(This is an invasion, the evil genius Green Lantern)
Okay (Mike Shinoda)
Ladies and gentlemen I would like to welcome you
to a Fort Minor event (uh-huh)
The countdown has begun (that's right)
"The Rising Tied" is almost here
But for now (c'mon Mike!)

[Mike Shinoda]
Yo, let's get it goin for the every man, anybody
You gotta be ready, it's heavy when we get it rowdy
We won't apologize or even think of sayin sorry
This is the way we rock steady... {*scratches*}
Yo, let's get it goin for the every man, anybody
You gotta be ready, it's heavy when we get it rowdy
We won't apologize or even think of sayin sorry
This is the way we rock steady over everybody
You probably shocked, probably ready to stop this already
You probably can't hang with the way we attack it so steady
We let it rock the room and bang the Benz, shake the Chevy
'Til everybody feels it in the chest, say it with me

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
This is the time so just follow me
It's, already heated to 100 degrees
So get up, get up, get up, get up
Get up, get up, get up, get up

[Mike Shinoda]
Wait a second, you know the program, this is not a slow jam
This is not a love song, unless you love tearing shit down
Take a look around, you're not runnin this
You're bluffin, you're nothin, we'll hit you like a ton of bricks
Hit you together with pressure you can never stand
The softest leather just a featherweight, whatever man
We're not your competitors settin you straight
You never compete, forget it, it's already too late - go!

[Chorus]

[Interlude: Mike Shinoda]
Yo, if you don't see I'ma make you see this
If you don't know I'ma make you believe it
Get up, get up, get up, get up
Get up, get up, get up, get up

[Mike Shinoda]
Shh, give me a second, I'm collectin my thoughts
And settin plots; all right, y'all ready or not?
I've listened and watched and waited for an openin spot
And now that I got it, nobody can pay me to stop
I'm sick of that, same thing I've been forced to hear
Over and over again, let me make this clear
If any-body pretends that we're nothin to fear
I solemnly swear it's over, you can tell 'em we're here

[Chorus]

[Interlude]

"Everybody owes, everybody pays because...
 that's how you stand up against the rising of the tide."</pre>
