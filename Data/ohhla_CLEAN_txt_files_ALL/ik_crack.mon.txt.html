Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
Gettin money on my own pace
Tell me what you know about it
Gettin head in the freeway
Tell me what you know about it
Gettin money in a bag
Phone taps from the feds
Break'em down
Stack the bread
Tell me what you know
Hey now
Tell me what you know about it

[Verse 1]
Red, Yellow, Blue diamonds
What ya know about it
My cross light cause frostbite
What ya know about it
Hundred thou' nigga
What ya know about it
And I ain't talkin bout a check
What ya know about it
Respect on the street
What ya know about it
Before you rapped on a beat
What ya know about it
You fuck niggaz queer
And I know about it
The streets see it clear
And they know about it
Fuck rap I sell oz's
What ya know about it
I sell product for my soul
What ya know about it
GT Sport
What ya know about it
Engine Start when I talk
What ya know about it

[Chorus]
Gettin money on my own pace
Tell me what you know about it
Gettin head in the freeway
Tell me what you know about it
Puttin money in a bag
Phone taps from the feds
Break'em down
Stack the bread
Tell me what you know
Hey now
Tell me what you know about it

[Verse 2]
Mixtapes/Videos
What ya know about it
I ain't need the radio
What ya know about it
Back against the wall
What ya know about it
And I came back with more
What ya know about it
Keep this work
What ya know about it
Nigga we everywhere
You just heard about it
Get knocked
Don't say a word about it
Seen the realest niggaz fold
What ya know about it
Bitches lined up at the shows
What ya know about it
Head blow ya out ya clothes
What ya know about it
I took over the streets
What ya know about it
I grind No sleep
What ya know about it

[Chorus]
Gettin money on my own pace
Tell me what you know about it
Gettin head in the freeway
Tell me what you know about it
Gettin money in a bag
Phone taps from the feds
Break'em down
Stack the bread
Tell me what you know
Hey now
Tell me what you know about it</pre>
