[D-Sisive]
Hello (hello) hello (hello) hello
Broken telephone, yelling at the tone
We sleep sweet, jealous when we don't
Dreams sell us what we'll never own
Yet we still chose to never let them go
Never let them slip, never let them fall
Never close, never will I fold
Never bury hopes seven steps below
I'd rather croak than settle for
a silver medal second isn't gold
Second's better off never born
Manute Bol on the pedestal
I'm an open book stenciled on the wall
Never judge a book, cause I read 'em all
A love-me-not petal plucked and thrown
Dancing elephants prancing to my song

[D-Sisive]
Hello (hello) hello (hello) hello
Broken telephone, yelling at the tone
We sleep sweet, jealous when we don't
Dreams sells us what we'll never own
Emcees weap, jealous of my poems
Questioning my throne, jealous of my Jones
Rain keeps falling on they skulls
Weathering the storm, umbrellas never close
They try to fight - but they're all
pissing in the wind, pellets at a stone
You could have ran, but the levee's broke
You should have swam, but you never stoked
Woulda shoulda coulda now you'll never now
what it's like to smell the petal of a rose
A love-me-not petal plucked and thrown
Dancing elephants prancing to my song

[Outro]
Kool-Aid, Kool-Aid
A five cent package makes two quarts of
Kool-Aid, Kool-Aid
9 great flavors, the drink you love~!
Kool-Aid, Kool-Aid
For the very best drink you ever made
Kool-Aid, Kool-Aid
Be sure that the envelope says - Kool-Aid!
You can give your youngsters a lot of pleasure with Kool-Aid
You know it's pure and good, it has the Parents Magazine seal
And it's so thrifty! A five cent package, makes 2 full quarts
Just add Kool-Aid to water with ice
Add some sugar, and stir
For the very best drink you ever made
Be sure that the envelope says - Kool-Aid!</pre>
