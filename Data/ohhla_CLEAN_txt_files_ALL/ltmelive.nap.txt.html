[Napoleon]
Yo, how can I make it out the hood without copping a ki
Would I still be fly if I only shop with a G
Could I be the new king, that put a lock on the D
Go head and give me the crown, nobody's hotter than me
Can I cop a new Porsche, without the knocks and the D's
Running 'round investigating while you plotting on me
Can I get a fair trial without copping a plea
When my album go platinum, man, just watch and you'll see
If the whole world was built from a rock and a tree
I can get twenty million with a glock and some D
All I really wanna do is cruise through yard and the sea
With Christina Milian, man, she hotter than B
I can make her cum twice, without, poppin' an E
I can out race the cops, if I hop in the Z
I can run two spots and bag a lot of debris
You can't drive through my hood without 'em flocking the meat

[Chorus: Napoleon]
Living life in the hood is so depressing and sheist
Twenty eight for a brick, that's a hell of a price
I know you talk about me, shit, they talk about Christ
Muthafucka, let me live my life, my life
If you got dough, the beast come out at the night
Trying to set a nigga up, pull a professional heist
Don't hate, if we spend fifty thousand on ice
Muthafucka, let me live my life, my life

[Napoleon]
Can you dudes stop snitching, fucking up the game
I don't care if you jealous, I ain't tucking in my chain
Old folks think I'm crazy when I'm plucking in the rain
Not knowing late nights, my chick sucking in the range
Can I use baking soda when I'm fluffing up my 'caine?
Can I get dough without putting something in your brain?
This model chick like I'm sexy, I ain't fronting, you insane
Last night, we spoke, she said Po', come with me to Spain
I don't know what to do, the weed, pumping through my veins
It's a different kind of high, feel like I'm jumping from a plane
If the spot get raided, yeah, we flushing down the drain
I ain't trynna be the celly of a Russian in a gang
I don't care about the coke, it's more rushing on the train
Ex-cons turn informats, don't be hustling where I slang
Scared the dudes and the feds, we discussing where I hang
Recollecting money talk, cuz I ain't fussing with them lames

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
