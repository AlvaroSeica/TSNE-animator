Typed by: Nas_Ill_Will_Records@Yahoo.com

[Chorus: 4X]
I "Buss My Gun" for the one I love

[Jungle]
Yo, do you wanna live or do you wanna die?
I throw you out the bridge wit a bullet in yo' eye
Like the ribbon in the sky you'll be floatin in the air
Gotta see yo' mother cry at the wake I'll be there
I give her a hug and tell her to be strong
And smack her in the face wit a .44 long
I know I'll be wrong thats how I get it on
I hope that knowlege the hook on this song
I got mack's n tech's, snub revolver's
Oozy I got 'em, gaze no problem, calico's AK's
.357, .9 mili tray .8 send you to heaven
I gave my lady a .380, a .22 or a .25, bitch went crazy
Your poppin foreva, one for all
Bravehearted we standin nigga fuck all ya'll

[Chorus: 4X]
I "Buss My Gun" for the one I love

[Nashawn]
Ya, Ya
Stop playin I'm layin for my dawgs that I'll die for
Cabbage pack these niggaz, souls in the sky mourn
Shots rhein, glock bang hot thangs
Leave 'em wit his watch and rings
Stop and aim, I'll pop, tops all 'fore I got my rocks
for my family, you a corpse, what you thought for my seeds
I'll even let the wrong man bleed
Sit there and for the right one and give 'em three
You see me don't think cause I'm on tv
That a nigga won't massacre your family
I love guns and bustin 'em off for love ones
Get it done, big as small ones even for funs
I love cash, for loot; I'll kill yo ass
Bangs through the roof or the coupe, I'll watch the blood splash
And I hate most dudes that ain't my blood
And I "Buss My Gun" for the one I love

[Chorus: 4X]
I "Buss My Gun" for the one I love

[Wiz]
I bust 'em guns for the ones I...love
I leave a nigga leakin for somethin
Them guns quicker and quicker heat seak is comin
My nigga Jung jumpin on niggaz his shells is jumpin
No finger prints, shoot again these mothafuckas don't make sense
Sayin me and my niggaz we can't win, why?
See the guns pointed at yo' face
plus your cliques 'round cause they fake, they die
See my attitude, buss a mothafucka for food
Now I'm mad at you hit you then I tossed the two
Neva sobber, shoot niggaz and run 'em over
G-Wiz DH, come test a QB soldier
I run away wit your head in my arm like Brett Favre
If mothafuckas takin the street them Bravehearts
Shootin on these mothafucka faggots
Ga'head and pull your gun nigga, I'mma grab it then I..

[Chorus: 4X]
I "Buss My Gun" for the one I love</pre>
