[Chorus X6: Champ M.C.]
We catchin wreck ya'll, yeah we catchin wreck
(Catchin what?) Catchin wreck ya'll, yeah we catchin wreck

[Champ M.C.]
I kicks it live when I'm delt the
My mic and my friend, no wack mc be the end of me
On this stage is where I ctach wreck
Goin out with shots, Champ gets all respect
Anyways I'm rollin deep, so don't get close
Before I pull it and blast your ass with the toast
Uh, I get nasty baby
You bitch ass chicken, got you pushin up daisies
Niggas take me for a joke
I hit the blunts first, and leave the room full of smoke
Out the business, catchin wreck, leavin bitches in body bags
End it all with the rest of the trash

[Chorus X3]

[Champ M.C.]
I figure by now you know my style, plus a son of a ??? pussy
Wishin that you could get with me
But nanananana, I think you better let it go
Because the way I flow is too dramatic
You don't want no static, no drama
So pass this summer so I can get illy high
Watch me do a rhyme by old child
Champ MC is nasty, and ya click can't even last me
Time to run shit, and do a show
But there I go, there I go, there I go
Extremely outrageous and kinda dangerous
But I got the flava of style that made me type famous

[Chorus X4]

[Champ M.C.]
Well I wanna hop a Champ MC, chillin with Taboo
Gettin freaky, freaky is our business
Where I'm at, havin a rap attack, where I may be at
Hit you so hard, cause your ass to have a heart attack
Ooh kid, feel the pain, cuz we comin to a theater near you, so watch ya back
I got the gats, watch my back, it's like that
Ratatatat, take that you fucking dirty rat
Ooooh, I can feel it in my bones, it's all in my mind
Then I gotta chill out my spine
Tellin me and D to catch wreck on the mic
Even though all the dick beaters ?break lights?

[Chorus X8, Champ overlapping]</pre>
