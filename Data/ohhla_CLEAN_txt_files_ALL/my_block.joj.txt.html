On my block, I sit on crates in front of papis
And sling crack cocaine until the coppers knock me
It's probably not the smartest thing for me to be doing
Imagine, with a Hummer parked outside is what I'm pursuing
On my block, you get your feelings hurt quick
If you try to move work and you ain't with me, shit is shifty
From all angles, forty five to two eighteen
Don't get your ass dragged off in between
Them kids is mean on my block
My niggas puff blueberry and sip Bruce Banner
Listening to our scanner
And even though we don't speak, I'll let you know the cops is coming
Ya'll niggas be safe now, for miles the cops is coming
Now that's the least that I can do for a brotha
After all I know his mother and I chill with his brother
On my block, shout out to my Incarcerated Scarfaces
Stolen whips, I been in car chases
I know it's God's graces that I beat those copped cases
I pray for every ghetto, hoping that the Lord save us
But anyways, at the end of the day
Your flesh rules, so your ass is ok
See ya'll tomorrow man, on my block
