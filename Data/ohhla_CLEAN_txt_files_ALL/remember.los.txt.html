(Pony Boy)
I remember
Do you remember?
Homeboy showing love do you remember? (4X)

(Pony Boy)
Cause I remember growing up in shorties
Buck wild drinking up a lot of forties
Oldies make E's in the sky
Why I rose made dog we use to ride
Kitchens cool in the woods by the tracks
We use to gather up our homies in backs
Talking shit all the time getting drunk
Lying about bony bitches getting grunk
Young dumb full of cum
Never gave a fuck unless we're getting some
Getting our dicks wet you can bet
Always holding up our fucking set (that's right)
Pick a fight, every night, smoking bud drinking bud out of sight
(Pile of gold) got me in a daze
smoking up the best cause you know I'm getting blaze

(Chorus: Pony Boy)
I remember you Oooo
Homie thought you know (though you knew)
I remember you Oooo (Homie thought chu knew)

(Vibe Metal)
Yo I remember life in the hoods Chicago 18 Street
Just trying to make ends meet
And struggling just to eat (Butchu know)
School of hard knocks running the blocks
Riding the train and playing bull in empty lots
And it don't stop family was all that we had
Sticking together through whatever
when times were good or bad and I'm glad
We made it this far ... Ghetto superstar
Do you remember when niggaz they had no car?
Me and my cousin's young bucks riding bikes
Spending the nights talking about girls that we like
Fist fights city lights trying to keep my mind right
 Sunday church with the family to keep the ears tight (Aight)
No diamonds no blingers just dreams of rapping
Singing bringing the money back to the hood and doing good
The hard times and the hopes and dreams
About the dollars we would grew up to be

(Chorus)

(Pony Boy)
Do you remember? (Sssss Ah)
Smoking out in September
Fumando Marijuana esta la ma√±ana
swena la canpana
Asi me gusta para fumar
Real yescas vamous a buscar
La cucaracha no quiere camenar
Porque le falte Marijuana para fumar
Those were the good old days when we got blaze
Going to jams every weekend token up jays
I reminisce I reminisce all those times that I miss
My very first joint and my first kiss from a bitch
No regrets I feel no shame
Take me back right down memory lane

(Yo hold up hold up I think I know this cat from high school.
 Yo pony boy it's Vibe Metal do you remember me?
 What up though Vibe Metal... they start to chatter)

(Pony boy &amp; Vibe Metal)
I remember you Ooooooooo (I remember you who who who
Homie thought you know (though-chu knew though-chu knew)
I remember you Ooooooooo (I remember you who who who)
Yes I do, Homie I thought-chu knew
I thought-chu knew, I thought-chu knew (Yeah Yeah)</pre>
