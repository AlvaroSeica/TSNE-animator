[Verse 1]
I was born in a stereo!
Hearing beats and rhymes everywhere I go!
Moms and pops could never ever stop the flow
Music in my soul
That's the scenario!
The first day
Make a big wish cause it's my birthday
I wanna make songs, yes in the worst way! Hay!!
In the stereo
Me and my people float round like a merry-go Hah!
I got the funk in my soul call me the funk guardian
Catch me in the club partying, sipping a bit of "Aahh!" Bacardi and
Hollaring, bouncing!
Flowing like water from a fountain
I got news to spread I'm out the box
Let me change my diapers on these blocks
I be dropping like chicken pocks
I got brothers bumping to it. Like it or not
See I said goodbye to my bro's and my tran-sistors
Told moms and pops "I'm out! I need something more!!"
You see I'm circuit board and I need something new
I'm curious what everybody else is bumping to

[Chorus]
Now the story is told
I was born in a stereo
Cause that vibe in you
Is inside me too
And if you want you got it
But the truth gon' prove
It's inside of you
You can call me when you need me
In the morning or the evening
I'm on the AM or the FM
Just turn me on and that's all

[Verse 2]
I crack the deck
Splashing the sound that'll have you wet
I throw your head back like I snapped your neck
I help relieve stress like y'all caught amnesia
For sure! It's like smoking too much reefer
See people make love to me!
Roll dubs to me!
Tripped out bug to me!
Even old people clap to that
They call me soul food, have 'em snacking that
Back and forth and forth and back
Make the world go round like a Laundromat
I make you get high like you sniffing crack
Whether it's soul or funk some people call it that
Whether it's rock and roll just get off your back
You wanna get live? "Yeah I'm feelin that!"
So born in a stereo!

Everyone's live now here we go

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Now it's going down!
My head is spinning like a slip mat going round
I hear the DJ calling my name out!
I blow the spot when he pleases then I cross fade out!
Grab my jacket, and head back to the crate
You hear the scratch then I transform to a break
Watch us transform to a break
Now they say I'm crazy oh so instrumental
The way that I grow is exponential
I think I should go promo
"Roc will it ever stop?"
"I don't know ?!"
Now every single word I'm spitting is a testament to
A force that don't hurt when it smack your neck up
I can't let the habit go
But it don't really matter though it's so dope you know

[Chorus]
Born in stereo
Hearing beats and rhymes everywhere I go
Duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh
Music in my soul that' the scenario
Everyone's live now here we go
We were all born in a stereo
And the vibe in you
Is inside me too</pre>
