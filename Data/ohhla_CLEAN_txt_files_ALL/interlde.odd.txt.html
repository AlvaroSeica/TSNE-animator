I don't fret when I'm fronted on
I'm a threat, I been a nigga, nigga wanted gone
and if ya man hit me first verse
&amp; hit you up after bet you ask him for another song
I'm a nigga you put a 100 on
if you didn't what went wrong
lord knows you can't have the sweet without the bitter
the nosebleed seats will help you see the bigger picture
&amp; when you're on the floor the stage is where
you're trying to get to
&amp; when you're on the stage, staying there is what you wish for
problems is relative, whether it's a million or a dollar
it's the fact you had to borrow that's the problem
success is the same, what I may consider winning or gain
some dismiss as I'm missing the aim
but the target ain't locked in, there's several options
though indecisiveness try not to get lost in
I'm crazy with caution</pre>
