[Verse One: Snoop]
Yeah lil mama you lookin good
I see you wanna play with a player from the hood
come holla at me, you got it like that
big Snoop Dogg with the lead Pussycat
I show you how it go down, yea I wanna throw down
me and you one-on-one, treat it like a showdown
you look at me and I look at you
I'm reachin for your shirt whatchu want me to do?

[Chorus 2X: Pussycat Dolls]
I'm telling you loosen up my buttons baby (Uh huh)
But you keep fronting (Uh)
Saying what you going to do to me (Uh huh)
But I ain't seen nothing (Uh)

[Verse Two: Pussycat Dolls]
Typical
Hardly the type I fall for
I'm liking the physical
Don't leave me asking for more
I'm a sexy mama (Mama)
Who knows just how to get what I want and (Want and)
What I want to do is spring this on you (On you)
Back up all of the things that I told you (Told you)

You been saying all the right things all night along
But I can't seem to get you over here to help take this off
Baby, can't you see?
How these clothes are fitting on me
And the heat coming from this beat
I'm about to blow
I don't think you know

[Chorus 2X]
I'm telling you loosen up my buttons baby (Uh huh)
But you keep fronting (Uh)
Saying what you going to do to me (Uh huh)
But I ain't seen nothing (Uh)

[Verse Three: Pussycat Dolls]
You say you're a big boy
But I can't agree
'Cause the love you said you had
Ain't been put on me
I wonder
If I'm just too much for you
Wonder
If my kiss don't make you just
Wonder
What I got next for you
What you want to do? (Do)

Take a chance to recognize that this could be yours
I can see, just like most guys that your game don't please
Baby, can't you see?
How these clothes are fitting on me
And the heat coming from this beat
I'm about to blow
I don't think you know

[Chorus 2X]

[Verse Four: Snoop]
Now you can get what you want but I need what I need
Now let me tell you what's crackalackin 'fore I proceed
I'm a show you where to put it at
PCD on me yea I thought I saw a puddycat
now roll with the big dog all 6 of y'all on me now tell me how it feel babydoll
Ashley, Nicole, Carmit, Jessica, Kimberley, Melody you tellin me

[Verse Five: Pussycat Dolls]
I'm a make you loosen up my buttons babe
Loosen up my buttons babe
Why don't you loosen up my buttons babe
Loosen up my buttons babe

I'm a make you loosen up my buttons babe
Loosen up my buttons babe
Why don't you loosen up my buttons babe
Loosen up my buttons babe

[Chorus 4X]</pre>
