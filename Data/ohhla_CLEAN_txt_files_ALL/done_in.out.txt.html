*Talking*
Yeah... it's just part of the game...
Know what I'm sayin'?...  Runnin' trains on these hoes...
Check me out now...

[Young Zee]
Girls, I got 'em locked like Casanova Rudd
After I fuck they'll need a bath to soak the blood
These young girls think they can screw?  I'm laughin' at 'em
I get in back and rag 'em; I use a whole pack of Magnums
My niggas get knocked for havin' on the vest blastin'
Court-type shit; your crew do time for trespassin'
Yo, see Dee?  Niggas might feel (???)
The video better look like Hype Williams filmed it
I hit the Internet to find out where to get a tec
And a pack of Dip cigarettes so tell me where to send a check
Bitch, your shit is drippin' sweat off my silhouette
Screamin' 'til you get it wet and I ain't even hit it yet
I'm failin' all my piss tests
Smokin' with these hoes with them big, big breasts
Uhh, uhh... so don't be ashamed
Let my man fuck, we'll be runnin' a train'

{Chorus}
[Axe] Yo, if a nigga act up he get one in the brain
[Zee] That's the type shit that get done in the game
[Axe] She let one of us fuck, man, we runnin' a train'
[Zee] That's the type shit that get done in the game
[Axe] See, the O-U-Tz, we gon' come with the pain
[Zee] That's the type shit that get done in the game
[Axe] Yo, we bring the fuckin' noise like the thunder and rain
[Zee] That's the type shit that get done in the game

[Axe]
Axe, you can tell he's nice
Want enough dough to get my celly iced;
tote guns bigger than Kelly Price
Droppin' mad bombs
Fuck safety, keep the gat on; .44 Taurus in my Phat Farm
Sucker, please, it's the O-U - fuckin' -Ts
They back puffin' trees' got your girl puffin' these
Fool, be strapped, no way you can do me, black
Let the tooley clap, put one in your bourgeois hat
Put your brains in your dooley lap
Like Air Max, I'm everywhere you be at, settin' booby traps
Holy shit!  Axe the black Moby Dick!
Yo, he's sick!  Walk out the door, he get, "Blow me, bitch!"
Fuck around, my crew might base
You should quit this and go back to school like Ma$e
'Cause at rap you suck, I'll have to clap you ducks
Make the coroner wrap you up, ask two nuts

{Chorus}

{Hook: Pace Won}
Nobody run game like these Brick City niggas
We shuttin' down your spot; we takin' what you got
Yo, can't nobody set it off like them Brick City niggas
We bustin' at the cops; police on the block
Yo, don't nobody hold it down like them Brick City niggas
We shuttin' down your spot; we takin' what you got
Yo, don't nobody bring the ruck' like them Brick City niggas
We bustin' at the cops; police on the block

[Young Zee]
We could be together if you just listen and be strong
First you gotta fuck D.U. then you gotta fuck P-Long
Cops better rappin'?
That's like God and the Devil bein' friends again,
that could never happen
I snap out, not even police chief can stop me
I be stompin' niggas' teeth with my beef and broccoli
Your whole tape run game
Your girl want bang, your whole clique run trains

{Chorus}</pre>
