[Intro: Lounge Lo]
Yeah, man, Elise, what up, man?
This is what us brothers get
I'll always love you, man
When we think, regardless of the situation
NahImean? NahI'msayin'?
Thinks y'all girls just be, in the crib
But, you know, y'all females, do what y'all feel
And start feelin' theyself, and act like
These are the things that happen
Like we follow it, come on

[Lounge Lo]
It was February 17th, 1990
I had ya girlfriend hooked, but you knew where to find me
In 160 Park Hill, that's where the God chill
Along with sharpshooters and cats that drug deal
But anyway, there's many times I snuck you in
And I remember the first time I tucked you in
We had sex and I touched ya skin, and it was all love
So high, so nice, it was all drugs
You met my Old Earth, you met my Old Dad
You know my Aunt Jean, Aunt Janet, Aunt Pat
Now that you live with me, yeah, got a kid from me
And, yeah, I told my boys from my hood that you my wizardtry
And things got deep, you had my kids
And you always came to court but you ain't have to do bids
Cuz I'm no type to be in Riker's Island
You know the kid Beezy like it easy, livin' life on Staten Island

[Chorus 2X: Lounge Lo]
Regardless of the situation, we gon' make it out
Might need space first before we try and work it out
But you gotta be O.T. to work it out
For me to put my heart in it all and wanna work it out

[Lounge Lo]
I respect what goes around and come back to you
And if you set somethin' free you love, it come back to you
I messed up and had babies on you, you went crazy on me
Got hooked, but that's not the lady for me
Hangin' with this one, I told you to stop that
And now you hangin' with that one and listenin' to the block chat
I know I did dirt and had my faults
But tell me where we went wrong up in New York
When Killa K had a party and I needed support
Sixteen years, were cut down, so so short
What family in the hood you know better than us?
We been around the whole time since each got bust
No attitudes and disses, just straight hugs and kisses
And one day, you gon' be my Misses
And me no worry cuz I'm gon' cake up
And Method Man said it's "Break Ups 2 Make Ups"

[Chorus 2X]

[Outro: Lounge Lo]
Elise, man, lemme tell you somethin'
Ya girlfriends got ya head gassed up, man
KnowImean? You know what we 'bout, man
You know what I did, man
I know what you did, man
You better stop actin' like... I'm not that dude, man
And you ain't that girl, man
KnowI'msayin'?
I ain't frontin' on you, kid, word up
I'ma always love you, man, regardless of the situation </pre>
