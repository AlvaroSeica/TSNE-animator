[Verse 1: manCHILD]
I push my pen past the breaking point, the point of no return
Past the pointed fingers, past the point at which you learn
Past ideas and perceptions, past lies and deception
Pass my life around the room to try to make the right connections
My obsession is this; past cash, past crime
Past beats, past rhymes, past life and past time
After time, time is money, time out, timing is everything
Your mind's my forty acres, on these fertile plains I'm settling
I'm steadily gold medaling in peddling what's the truth
Point my finger to the heavens and grip the heart to break it loose
I'd bear my soul to save the youth and place myself upon the altar
Make this world a better place both for my wife and for my daughters
And that's a hard lesson to learn, because mankind's so unkind
Like political prisoners who threaten the agenda of One Time
One rhyme can't change the world, so make no mistake
And that's just my point.yeah, that's the point I'm trying to make

[Hook]
One rhyme can't change the world, but sill I'll never back down
Speak my peace on microphones and fade into the blackground
What's wrong has prospered too long, it's time to take it back now
Write what's right upon walls and fade into the blackground

[Verse 2: Sintaxtheterrific]
Sintax the backlit shadow box backdrop
Silouette of the sunset across the concrete blacktop
Bet He's more brilliant and beautiful than we thought
Burn fame on the fingers of flame from sunspot
Then bask in the black where the spotlight's not
Mic rock late at night so nobody can watch
Some serve in daylight, Christ taught behind the scenes
So I caught his sunstream with the sea of the unseen
Humility sunscreen, I thank God for anonymity
My geneology is a forest of family trees
More branches than a bank, thank you's to pass around
Put gratitude on paper, extend my words like verbal pounds
Remember my past like people in small towns
Regard simple truth and profound, then write 'em down
I've found I like to watch autumn leaves just fade to brown
They turn without a sound, I'd like to fade into the blackground
Then drown the well renowned, pound my pride until it backs down
Clown myself just so that Yahweh can abound
Soul Heir the manCHILD and Sintaxtheterrific
We ripped it for a lifetime, but we'll vanish in an instant
Blink once and you missed it

[Hook]
What's wrong has prospered too long, it's time to take it back now
Write what's right upon walls and fade into the blackground
One rhyme can't change the world but still I'll never back down
Speak my peace on microphones and fade into the blackground.

[Verse 3: manCHILD]
I build this lifeline in the nighttime, hide my presence in this place
Anonymity's a witch, but I've grown acccustomed to her face
And it's broken, camouflage my emotions, chosen token
Spoken to those cold and frozen and watched new life awoken
Got that close to closing notion, overdosing on the ocean
No one knows this unsung hero, the dirt that makes the tree grow
But it's all right, I'm a peace in the puzzle like Bill Cartwright
Programmed to command the mic with deepspace5 all night
I'm the fly on the wall who's watching each and every bar fight
I'm the brick wall backdrop that's decorated in the starlight
Mars ILL, we do battle deep in the belly of the beast
And as the b-boy backspins, we be the cardboard that's beneath
See this wedding of art and science and let's all live and grow together
I'll choose to keep the memories and you can choose to buy the records
Maybe make that life better, leave that soul no longer vacant
And let the prejudice skeptics keep warm with blanket statements
With patience I set my paces on city streets of Atlanta
While my people being slandered by that false propaganda
Got answers, got questions, gotta teach and learn lessons
ManCHILD spits one rhyme and it tastes like sunshine
Holy, divine design, peace to the nines worldwide
Play my part to perfection and softly fade into the B-side

[Hook]
One rhyme can't change the world, but still I'll never back down
Speak my peace on microphones and fade into the blackground
What's wrong has prospered too long, it's time to take it back now
Write what's right upon walls and fade into the blackground
Refuse to be pimped into a record label's cash cow
Speak what's real upon reels and fade into the blackground</pre>
