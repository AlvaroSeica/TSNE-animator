[Latoya Williams]
Ooooh...
Hi, my name is Latoya Williams
and this is a story about; my man
You see ladies, I had this man about, two or three years ago
And boy did I love my man
But somethin awful happened, mmm
and they took him away for awhile {*door slamming*}
Now I know some of you ladies out there know what I'm talkin about
Here's my story...

I'm feelin so lonely, lonely, lonely, lone
As I sit by the phone, mmm
Days are long, nights are cold
There's no one home, but me
What am I to do? - I find myself,
callin you, over and over and over
Please, pleeease, come and rescue me
From all this pain, all this pain, and agony! OoohHHHhhh!

(But all, I have is time without you)
And that's not good, oh no!
(It hurts, to know there's nothin I can do)
If I could, but I gotta try (try) and do it! (do it)
Cuz your not here, and I'm so alone without you! (you)
So I'll do it (do it)
Sometimes! It hurts so much that I cry! (cry)
and I bawl (mmmmmmm)
Cuz my baby, my baby, my baby ain't home
OoohHHHhhh no!
OohhHHh, ohhhHHh-ho-ho

*more harmonizing*

My baby, my baby...
(But all, I have is time without you)
And that's not good, oh no no no!
(It hurts, to know there's nothin I can do)
If I could, but I gotta try (try) and do it! (do it)
Cuz your not here, and I'm so alone without you! (you)
Sometimes! It hurts and then I cry! (cry)
and I bawl (mmmmmmm)
Cuz my baby, my baby, my baby ain't home
Ohhh! Ooo-oo-oooooohh...</pre>
