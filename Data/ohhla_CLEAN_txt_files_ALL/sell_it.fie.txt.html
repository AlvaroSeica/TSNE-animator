[Hook]
I'ma sell this dope, I'ma get this money
I'ma flip this coke, I'ma count all hundreds
I'ma sell this dope, I'ma get this money
I'ma bang this pistol, and I'ma count all hundreds
 
[Fiend]
I got 25 pounds, each tire of the whip
Keep the city high if I retire, they gon' be sick
Went 25 hours, was cooking entire bricks
Started gang affilliated, made a empire bitch
If you from the boot where they shoot, for less than a quarter
Then you knew hood respect, only went to the ballers
Killers dealers, and go getters
Bitches like, what they fuck I'ma do with a broke nigga
So the coke got cheaper, when you bought it by the boat
Had the cluckers rushing through the lines, like Marshall Faulk
The diesel had em snorting, or resorting to the needle
And watch jealous niggaz, they reporting to the people
See my brother taught it all to me, stall and you can ball with me
Now I tell them thick bad girls, you can all hit me
If I ain't knocking off a K, I'm barely popping off the K
All in a day, trying to see another way
 
[Hook]
 
[Fiend]
I extort a few niggaz, export a few niggaz
But never on stand in court, like you niggaz
In and out of town, 59-65
85-95, with the product I'ma ride
My girl Keisha, hustle harder than the most
Trying to keep the butter on her toes
Look into these eyes, many men died trying to kill me
In the box, was the only way to feel me
I got my corner boys, eating like they never ate befo'
I'm a G, they don't make no mo'
To hell with gasoline draw's on ya, where the fake gon' go 
Try to cross me, you ain't even gotta pray no mo'
I got the girls in the shake joint, titty booty shaking 
Get a Q to me final soft, nigga for the baking
You can beg all you want, until I recieve a ransom
Your life got better eyes, trying to shit inside a Phantom
 
[Hook]
 
[Fiend]
I test white till my gums numb, guns full of dum-dums
Bring the hundred drum-drum, and they all run
Middle of the block locked, who really want some
Not much movement, but a lump sum
Boy'll get you hooked, like a fish in the pond
And the word travel fast, when you only pushing bomb
It ain't easy in the city, care forgot
Can't take it with shit, then get off the pot 
I know this lil' nigga, played it raw and got his face shot off
Set fire to his place, laughing riding off
He fronted with the shake, and sold them boys flour
They went to go and bake, and came back in a hour
Got a couple hami's on my belt, couple mam's in the brook
East coast women, love a down South crook
You ain't never seen cars, and these trucks
Cause the money like a trick, coming fast as the fuck
