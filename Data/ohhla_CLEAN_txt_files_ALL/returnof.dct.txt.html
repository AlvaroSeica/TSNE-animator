I'm coming out like a .45
Spinning like a Wurlitzer on overdrive
Feeling like electroglide
Touch down satellite, feel alright
Tonight, return of love
Return, return of the singer

Twist me up and watch me turn
Just like a falling star about to burn
Center down and outward thrust
The curtain's up baby, it's all or bust
Tonight, return all the love you get
Return, return of the singer

It's tailor made and it's heaven sent
Just think about the time we've spent
The way we moved the words we said
If nothing else a testament
Oh my love, oh my baby
No one else can make me crazy like you, like you

Cause we're all about to move on
No one here without a song
Pilfering the planet's blood
Been making up the moment from after the flood
Tonight, return of love
Return, return of the singer

I'll tell you how it's gonna be
We're gonna make some history
A microphone, the truth we need
No joke, no trend, no fad of the week
Horde of angels, sing as one
You know my heart has come undone again, again

Return, return of love
Return, return of the singer
Return of all the love you get
Return, return of the singer</pre>
