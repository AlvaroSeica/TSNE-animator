[Intro: Akon]
One two three, ooh yeah
Ooh-ohh-ohhh
I hope you don't mind
I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is

[T.I.]
Ay Tip, let me holla at you..
Makin your momma proud, lookin in your daughter's eyes
Kickin it with your sons, trippin, never realize
how good you got it, been so wrapped up in your losses
You couldn't see the profits, could still be in the projects
Instead releasin projects just poppin when niggaz floppin
So you went back to prison Tip, it could've been a coffin
Now since we talkin you've been trippin ever since I died
I appreciate you missin me but G you still alive
I'm lookin down at you, then sendin smiles to you
I checked the wedding out, oh tell Tameka hi, would you?
Told you she'll get you, that's good cause shawty ride wit'chu
Kids gettin big, seen King ridin a bicycle
Saw Nique-Nique drive a car, see Bubba big as you
I see Domani rappin, and he's spittin too
Lil' Deyjah beautiful, and Major super cool
My life is over with dawg, your life been good to you

[Chorus: Akon]
And you can tell everybody
This is your song
And you can tell everybody
This is your song
I hope you don't mind
I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is

[T.I.]
Sit down son..
Hey listen to me son, and pay attention too
Seems like I'm the only one that you'll listen to
I never knew the time that I ain't get to spend wit'chu
would ever result in you making yourself miserable
You gotta let it go, it's painful, I already know
The past is the past, just learn from it, grow
So you got {?} wit'chu, and your sister Precious too
I'm proud of you, did better than I expected you to
Although I knew you were special when you were smaller
That's why I was so much harder on you, knew you were smarter
Not much convo to offer, I wasn't much of a talker
Great to see you doin better than me, even as a father
Takin care of yo' momma, overcomin the drama
Your life is wonderful son, don't let 'em take it from ya
Keep livin it to the fullest, treasure it, it's a blessing
Be thankful for all this beauty, when it's over with forget it

[Chorus] w/ ad libs

[T.I.]
Damn; what up Phil? So good to hear from you, we missin you
Rememberin all of our conversations, daily reminiscin you
The hood the day they lost, could tell they don't know who to listen to
Today I watch over Jenee{?}, like she was my own and that could be gift for you
I swear, it's so unfair, that I'm right here, and you up there
I miss you so much now to the point I call your name but you not there
Now I can't rest, and I can't get shit off my mind, I'm so upset
It wasn't yo' time to leave me here, it broke my heart to see you dead
Shot with bullets that were meant for me, family's never forgivin me
I know - but all I could do is ball in your memory
And pops I thank you so much for leavin, I had to grow up
Slangin crack on the corner ain't quite the future you wanted for me
Was it? And this pain I feel it never goes away
Does it? This load I carry get no lighter
I grew up all on my own with a broken heart and a broken home
Taught me everything I've known, owe you everything I own
I must admit you raised a warrior, my life could be a story book
Hope you proud of me, didn't graduate from college but
Thanks for listenin to me, so long I had this problem ducked
'Til we meet in person let's keep speakin through my verses, for life

[Chorus]

[Outro: Akon]
This is your song</pre>
