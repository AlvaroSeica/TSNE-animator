[Chorus]
Pain inside my heart, troubles stay on my mind
Everything falls apart, it's happening all the time
Living by Murphy's Law, trying to have it all
Runnin from instant karma, every man's bound to fall

[Everlast]
Life is short, the grind is long
Some of my very best friends are gone
My hustle's strong, my money's all spent
on buyin bitches titties and drugs and rent
Work a double shift time, I can't save a dime
My daughter needs Rent-a-Center, just can't afford
'Bout to grab a 9, lose my mind
My insurance keeps sayin that they won't pay fo' it
I'll stage a heist, I'll pay the price
Don't be shocked when I turn to crime kid
I'm goin big, I might split yo' wig
Cause I ain't gettin knocked for no nickel and dime shit
All that glitters ain't all it seems
The American Dream is an American scheme
What'chu lookin at? What'chu trippin on?
Who you flippin on? See what I'm grippin on?

[Chorus]

[Everlast]
I've been breakin my neck just to live correct
Keep my head above water, livin check to check
I get no respect, I got no regard
Patience is a struggle when times is hard
Paper's in a shortage, tryin to pay the mortgage
I can't get to work they repossessed my car
'Bout to buy a pistol, and kidnap Bristol
Tell me bitch can you see me from yo' backyard~?
This new world session of the great depression
I'm livin off pre-emptive unchecked aggression
You cryin and you bitchin on every politician
My family tradition, is heavy ammunition
I've cocked the hammer, I'ma rock the vote
Got your forehead on lock, dead in my scope
Look me in the eye, what you lyin fo'?
What you livin by? What you dyin fo'?

[Chorus]</pre>
