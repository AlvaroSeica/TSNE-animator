Let's go back to nine seven, seventeen though I looked like 20
And I was poor, I didn't look like money
then I saw someone I thought who was mature, looked like she would shun me
And inside its like my pride had been took right from me
She loves to dance, dancin in the middle of the floor
So I thought I better get to her before
other guys start to notice she was fly, had a brother goin wild
tryna leave the club with the future mother of my child
(man) I can't believe it
nice ass and cleavage
She's 23, she's somebody I can see ME wit
2 weeks pass, now I'm gettin wit her
3 weeks pass, I'm livin wit her
5 weeks pass, now I'm in love I'm so glad that I met her
She's dedicating love songs Brandy "have you ever"
Have you ever had it bad but just a fad
It wouldn't last forever but still just LIKE

[Chorus]

Moms don't like her, but she adores me
struggling artist, no job, she supports me
So alone, my only friend is boo
So when its me against the world, the world gotta be against her too
In a year we was homeless, stuck on the street together
starvin, nothin to eat together
times get hard, the fightin and the bickering starts
And now she's throwin in my face about how I can't get a job
now she pregnant, another mouth to feed, add that on
nah the condom ain't break, I ain't carry that on
tryna be a man, I went and got a job at 'the wiz'
chill angie, I ain't got the right job for a kid
can't keep it, now she heated but we don't live lavish
it's a good thing you had that miscarriage
cause I'm against killin kids but I'da did it
I was wit it, she's spoiled it, I'm 19 lookin at my bloody son in the toilet (damn)
we beefin, she likes to bring up old things
And anytime we beef, she likes to throw things
but that knife, I couldn't dodge it
but my love was too strong so after surgery I dropped them charges
She said I beat her bad, I took her by her feet and dragged
to this day I don't believe that fact
can't see her bein heated and desertin me freely
I know you hurtin, it ain't workin I know you wanna leave me BUT

[Chorus]

After all the court cases, blame is in order
She's scared of me, hence the restraining order
had to break up but we made up, family mad at us too
lets have a baby and then maybe they'll be havin a truce
She actin rude, havin her moods
screamin "I'm pregnant", like that's an excuse
angie I ain't tryna hear you now
I had to bounce, I can't be there for you but I'll be there for the child
TRE! they had to cut mommy phoned me to clutch you
She was drugged up still screamin "joey I love you"
months passed, here come the cops again
She threw my clothes up out the window
And I end up in the building on the cot again
naw not again
I see that she's my baby mother but she's not my friend
that was the last straw, it was apparent
we ain't workin as a couple but lets see if we can work as parents
TRE! you know that mommy used to use you against me
but she got a little better, she don't use you to tempt me
see me on TV now things got better
She's says I'm not the same man that I was when I met her
She don't like Joe Budden, leave that for the public
She want the same guy that she fell in love wit
If she could ever turn it back to like the past
that's all she ask when she prayin
If I came at her like "I'm back" I know that all she'll be sayin is..

[Chorus]</pre>
