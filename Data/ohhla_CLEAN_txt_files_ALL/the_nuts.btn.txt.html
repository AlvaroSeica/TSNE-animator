(Little kid)
It's the Beatnuts

()
Hey world, come here (2x)

What you thought, I couldn't afford another drink
So I went up the bar, solo, bottle
Watch me slide, through the crowd in place
To chill backstage, anybody acts strange
smack them with the black gauce

I flow smooth to this, while you don't even know how to move to this
but it is the Beatnuts, we don't have to proof shit
Anything we drop is the shit, certified blazing
it ain't honeys like Marie Jason, 
bless and seven days like a hollow Daisin

After each show, the telle is like a peepshow
Doggie steelo, is how we hit each Ho
If I don't get you now, I'ma gonna get you next tour
Shortie looking like she wants to explore
Shortie looking like she wants to have sex raw
Shortie looking like enough of that, enough of that

Dull as they seem none of that, you don't got a ride home
Call your mother back, it's like that
Follow the rules and later you can swallow the jeweles
Bragging to your girlfriends
How you sucked it and I fucked it in the mini-chopper
Cause she just wanna have fun like Cyndi Laupher

Chorus:
It's the niggers that you play is hate to see
You know they run up in your girl from 1-2-3
It's the nuts (2x)

In the crib, in the club, and the SUV
It's the Shhh you wanna hear every place you be
It's the nuts (2x)

()
How much you wanna bet? I get as close as i wanna get
Everybody gets tough, see if I bled
Catch me in the club sittin in the shadows, bottle of J.D. 
Surrounded by some bad ho's treat them bitches like bodyarmour, 
If there is beef in the club I shoot right through your body mama
Why everybody hates so much? It's real out here but I can only take so much
I'm everything you love to hate
You man, you only want that fake (2x)

Chorus

Ah, Yo, what it is, what it is, can I touch this up a syndrom
Yo like my addicts can i drug this up
Drift flow to be sporadic, strictly bombs and such
How much for these fanatics want the dome and the gut, gone to clutch 
Watch how these chickers jump and double like ducks and then what 
How these niggers walk and duck in their trucks (What's the drive?)
Yo, I'm gonna keep you guessing your toes, ah yo fuck the gun play
Just some niggers and ho's for some party and shit
La-di-da-di shit, a niggers live to clip, 
A lady lives to dick and that shit
Now the party goes cardio vascio, cermonial masteral
To keep that factual, keep that a hundred nuts
Bust them with whatever yo, show off the hook
You crooks just stand shook, blow you niggers to bits
If you witnessed the fits, strictly kick the hits
On and on the shit, like what

Chorus
