Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Don't go over there, shit, I be skating too
So don't go over there, ahh

Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, over there
Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, over there
Beefing over there
Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap
Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap over there, ah

[Chorus]
Heard they shooting niggaz, don't go over there, ah
Stabbing, killing niggaz, don't go over there, ah
Heard he happen niggaz don't go over there, ah
South side, we from over there, ah
Heard they killing niggaz, don't go over there, ah
Stabbing, killing niggaz, don't go over there, ah
Heard he happen niggaz don't go over there, ah
East side, we from over there, ah
Don't go over there, don't go over there
Don't go over there, don't go over there

South side, they call that, they shoot guns, they snoll that
They ride chains, they carjack, got a payback for all that
Don't, don't go over there, nigga trim from over there
Run upon you that nigga, cash out right over there
Ain't nothing changed, still fucking niggaz over there
Catch them niggaz slipping, then we leave them niggaz over there
Them mad bitch be blowing there, don't get touring over there
Coke boys had snown there, like boston george that blow in there
Chop town off now my coupe looking brainless
I be twisted off a blue while my niggaz twisting fingers
And it let them niggaz famous, get you couple pages on the news nigga
Don't make one move, montana

[Chorus]
Heard he happen niggaz don't go over there, ah
South side, we from over there, ah
Heard they killing niggaz, don't go over there, ah
Stabbing, killing niggaz, don't go over there, ah
Heard he happen niggaz don't go over there, ah
East side, we from over there, ah
Don't go over there, don't go over there
Don't go over there, don't go over there

Cracks on the block, niggaz call that life oh
Hustlers on the corners doing pull ups on the light bulb
Shawty got hit, ain't even party yet
Been about a week the family ain't get the body yet
Police don't come over here, please don't come over here
You on your own if you getting caught over here
She bust that pussy open, she's a hoe there
And knew a popping that you gotta, we was over there
The stash that you left, it ain't over there
Fucked her 4 times and never went back over there
You know I don't care, never gave a fuck
Like a church full of nuns, ain't no saving us

[Chorus]
Heard he happen niggaz don't go over there, ah
South side, we from over there, ah
Heard they killing niggaz, don't go over there, ah
Stabbing, killing niggaz, don't go over there, ah
Heard he happen niggaz don't go over there, ah
East side, we from over there, ah
Don't go over there, don't go over there
Don't go over there, don't go over there

Nigga I'm from over there, where bitches got them fake lids, fake ass and that bogus hair
Ha, load is here, better know my soldiers here
Mix it up lil more in here, thank got got my chaufeur here
Everytime my show is here, and I know them hoes in here
And my flow that sixtine chapel, gotta know my shock is real
My flow is real, and I keep my toes and ear
And I keep my hoes in check, and I keep my foes in fear
Don't go over there, nah, not there or there, or there or there

[Chorus]
Heard he happen niggaz don't go over there, ah
South side, we from over there, ah
Heard they killing niggaz, don't go over there, ah
Stabbing, killing niggaz, don't go over there, ah
Heard he happen niggaz don't go over there, ah
East side, we from over there, ah
Don't go over there, don't go over there
Don't go over there, don't go over there</pre>
