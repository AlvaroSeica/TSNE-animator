Song:   Play it Loud
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[will.i.am]
I pledge, my allegiance
To rhythm, and sound
Music is my medicine
Let the rhythm pound

[Chorus One]
And play it loud, baby play it LOUD {*2X*}
Rock the crowd, baby rock the crowd
And play it loud, baby play it LOUD

[will.i.am]
I found a love, it's in the music
Drop all your games, drop all that bullshit
We found the love, inside of instruments
John Lennon, Bob Marley are my presidents
The sound of trumpets wake up people sleepin now
The drummer boy is drummin beats to shake the ground
The violins will pick you up when you are down
The melody will spin around and round and round

[Chorus Two]
And who's gonna stop us?
Who's gonna stop us from rockin with this sound?
Oh who's gonna stop us?
Who's gonna stop us from break-b-b-breakin it down?
And play it loud, baby play it LOUD {*2X*}
And rock the crowd, baby rock the crowd
And rock the crowd, baby play it loud

{*repeat 4X: "Hoo-HOOOOOO-hoo~!"*}

[will.i.am]
Hot beats comin from the city streets
MP3's via internet from overseas
DJ's play 'em, you, dance to 'em, swayin stayin up
All night, zombie life, audio delight, ohh
The sound of trumpets wake up people sleepin now, ohh
The drummer boy is drummin beats to shake the ground, ohh
The violins will pick you up when you are down, ohh
The melody will spin around and round and round

[Chorus Three]
And who's gonna stop us?
Who's gonna stop us from rockin with this sound?
Oh who's gonna stop us?
Who's gonna stop us from break-b-b-breakin it down?
Gonna play it loud, baby play it LOUD
Play it loud, baby play it LOUD
And rock the crowd, baby rock the crowd
PLAY IT LOUD, BABY PLAY IT LOUD

{*repeat 8X: "Hoo-HOOOOOO-hoo~!"*}

[will.i.am]
I pledge, my allegiance
To rhythm, and sounnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnd</pre>
