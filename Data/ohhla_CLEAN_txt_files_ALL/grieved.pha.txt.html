[Verse One]
Dear Diary, hear my plea
Though my eyes cry, through my tears I see
The worlds trend, we done crept up in some real sin
We so spent now we swept up in a whirl wind
And it seems like it wont stop til the world ends
How much more Lord will you endure until then?
Since Adam this pattern has plagued us
We followed our passions and look where it led us
You watched as Adam's first offspring
Off'd his brother cuz he was jealous of his offering
And as the years passed
We just kept going, the floods came as your tears splashed
Mixed with the steam of your fierce wrath
From your broken heart only those on the ark with Noah passed
Cuz only Noah found favor
Even though Noah couldn't hold it down later
Neither could Abraham
Neither could any of the prophets or priests or kings that you raised up stand
So with all these men, if you were grieved then
Then what keeps you from being grieved again?

[Chorus]
We know it's not nothing
It must be something that keeps you from being so grieved again
There'd be more than one flood if it wasn't for the Son's blood
To keep Him from being grieved again

[Verse Two]
Fast forward
From the past toward the present, past the torch light the path for us
Heaven, more than ever, cuz it's darker than it's ever been
We should be outside of the ark screamin' let us in
Check how we be with all our technology
With more ways to sin then any one man could possibly
And yet we invent more, like slaves indentured
Like sin vents through our pours
Evil as far as we can see, now we know drama like TNT
We found Pandora's Box, smashed the lock
Now look what's coming at us even on laptops
They push sin in the cinema, lovin it
Even vote it in to our government
We shed the blood of the innocent
Or know about it and won't do a thing to put an end to it
The way we see is distorted
Babies havin babies, more babies aborted
How can we afford to be this evil
When you flooded earth once what do we think keeps you from being grieved again?

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
Lord, I know our sin is sky high
And I know you don't turn a blind eye
You see every instance, all at an instant
You don't scoff at sin's stench, so you know we're wonderin
Where's all the rain and thunderin
Did we get away with our dirt, did the darkness cover us
Were our sins hid, won't your eyelids uncover us
But it's not that you're passive, it's just that your grace is active
Right where your wrath should be
So we casually sin til we're sentenced and sent to where they'll be gnashing of teeth
After Noah's flood there's two judgments left
The cross and the one at the end, that's death
And it's not sleep forever, it's beef with God feeling the heat forever
The rest of this life without God is hellish
The afterlife without God, that's what hell is
And we don't want that
Before you come back and we get beat down like drum tracks
Before Messiah comes
Before your eyes are tired of our lives and the fire comes
Help us to see Your Son and to believe in Him
Cuz His blood is the rich flood that keeps you from being grieved again</pre>
