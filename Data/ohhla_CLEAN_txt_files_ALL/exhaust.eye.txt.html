[Verse 1]
I'm so goddamn tired, cant tell if I'm done, or just un-inspired
and don't give me that you can be somebody speech
that ain't your place, let me be
I'm an example of a candle lit life
with electric relaxation, brain trampled by devotion
to remote control channel changin
something provoked the whole globe to lower expectations
damn, what's wrong with my generation?
we was the cream of the crop but it seems we've been robbed
that's what happens when you trade in all your dreams for a job
and every day it gets less and less exciting
I would make a difference but I'm busy faking this instead of trying
change my shift from now to never and I'll pretend I'm fine
why am I stuck at the shitty end of the assembly line
I guess I'm built to be intoxicated with hope
sometimes it's a journey, most the time it's just a bad joke
and in my scroll there's a junk drawr I can't organize
the first to come in last to leave we'll never be immortalized
this sort of life is completely overrated, I'm sick of being the
only one I know that's trying to take it
so right now I'm heading home, got sounds of nature for you born in
my headphones and half a bottle of ???
that's the reaction to an overdose of passion
brainless, stagnant...aint it magic

[Verse 2]
I never knew ambition could be so fuckin disgusting
I earn a good comission but it makes me feel so ugly
I'm on some not even knowing I'm an illuminatis just as long
as playin aging doesn't disrupt my funerals progress
I ain't changin for you I'm not reaching for the sky, I would
if you could give me one good reason why I should even try
because after a while this never ending lame game of what's better
could fracture your smiles mainframe forever
it's so fun to be in love..or so I've heard
the meaning has no feeling even though I understand the word
I used to try to make heaven right here on earth but that'll only
happen if you find someone else to do the work
I'll be suprised when my psychosis turns out to keep the driving focus
while I hold the same blurred cloud as burnt out dope heads
so for now my worthless counterwork has found a purpose everytime a
pound of dirt produced I get my frown referbished
two for one specials, if you order show the devils, head swole
running out of petrol but I wont let go of this gas pedal
till I'm settled and they finally ?? me with that sweet blind security
so insecure and messy, mark today the day that dedication died
instead of saying goodbye, I'm staying praying that'll I'll stay alive
because even though I know I hate to love you so much
I got no better place to go, that's why I always show up </pre>
