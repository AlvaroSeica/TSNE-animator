[Intro: Tech N9ne]
This is so, so crazy..
This long journey..
Look at all the love you gave me
You gave me the strength..
To keep on moving forward
Pushing me past the stars..
Now the light I'm running toward..

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
At the bottom of the barrel, I was like the rotten apple
And I never graduated, no gown, no cap and a tassel
But I stowed my education, now I got my teachers baffled
Wonder why I feel the terror of number one independent
God picked my name in the raffle
I was dealt a bad hand, wasn't gonna amount to nothing
Thank god that I had fans, keyboards, mics an percussion
Cuz with that yo I elevated, now I'm just celebrated
Whenever tecca nina hit the public
Taking so many pictures, signing the autographs
Leaving messages on your voice mails and I love it
And with all this new success I can't believe this love level
Specially when they thought that I was devil
A painted up psycho brotha who loves metal
The response is overwhelming, for the love, can't thank you enough
Dedicated to all the people who got me out of hell
Ya'll saved my life and stuff

[Hook: Jay Da 3rd &amp; (Tech N9ne)]
I opened up my heart, showed you what I had inside
An ocean full of truth, too deep for the lies
Ya made it to the pain, had to swim through the pride
There's nothing else I need to survive
Overwhelming! (So, so, so)
(Yeah, your love is so, so, so!)
So overwhelming! (So, so, so)
(Yeah, ay, it kept me alive yeah!)
Overwhelming! (So, so, so)
(Yeah, your love is so, its so, so!)
So overwhelming! (So, so, so)
(Yeah, it kept me alive yeah, yeah, come on!)

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Back in the days I went through visions, in my head, dreams that you'd listen
But my wonderful fans they came, and made it all come to fruition
Sometimes with the females I'll straight show my gratitude through kissin'
On the cheek, for the youngsters, foreheads, for the legal pound for the fella's and screw vixens
Way back when I was bitter, what's unused my music is litter, so mad at em, that I got jitters
Didn't consider that in a second I would be bigger, the label found that I was a hard hitter
I'd give'r shit was delivered hella hard from a spitter, gritter
Recognizing all the humongous love I'd get on facebook and positive messages on twitter
This is how I tell you thank you, to all of my fans I thank you
And you can tell all those suckaz that hate on the Nina they just upset that they ain't you
Cuz they favorite artist is lame, and neglects his fans, he does do
But your favorite artist goes out of his way to show you that he loves you

[Hook: Jay Da 3rd &amp; (Tech N9ne)]
I opened up my heart, showed you what I had inside
An ocean full of truth, too deep for the lies
Ya made it to the pain, had to swim through the pride
There's nothing else I need to survive
Overwhelming! (So, so, so)
(Yeah, your love is so, so, so!)
So overwhelming! (So, so, so)
(Yeah, ay, it kept me alive yeah!)
Overwhelming! (So, so, so)
(Yeah, your love is so, its so, so!)
So overwhelming! (So, so, so)
(Yeah, it kept me alive yeah, yeah, come on!)

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
So here's to all of my fans, your making my dreams come true
You helped me create this land, by believing in things one knew
And that one is N9ne, you brung his time to everyone and rhymed
All though some is blind you brung his lines to the sun and shined
Technician hunts, keeping my every condition pumped
Giving you what your suspicion wants, waking up these hissing punks
To the early strange fans, thank you for feeling my pain man
But for the newbies I'm so so glad that you made it, welcome to strangeland
The tattoos, the tears, the gratitude, the years
My life you get through sound, thank you cuz Tech you found
Just know that I'm thankful and I will never ever let you down

[Hook: Jay Da 3rd &amp; (Tech N9ne)]
I opened up my heart, showed you what I had inside
An ocean full of truth, too deep for the lies
Ya made it to the pain, had to swim through the pride
There's nothing else I need to survive
Overwhelming! (So, so, so)
(Yeah, your love is so, so, so!)
So overwhelming! (So, so, so)
(Yeah, ay, it kept me alive yeah!)
Overwhelming! (So, so, so)
(Yeah, your love is so, its so, so!)
So overwhelming! (So, so, so)
(Yeah, it kept me alive yeah, yeah, come on!)

[Outro: Tech N9ne]
Wow, thank you to all who love me
I mean it more than you know
I love you for feeling my music
And coming to every show
And I will forever be there
Through rain, sleet or snow
You're right there with the stars
Cuz I'm cutty now there's only one other place we can go</pre>
