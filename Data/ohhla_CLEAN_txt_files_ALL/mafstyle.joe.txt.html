[Joe Mafia]
I show you how to rock mic, kids, Maf's the nicest
Yeah, I said it with authority, and, I'm in it from the bottom
Of my four chambers, slang dangerous
The illest MC to thunder pound clowns, to keep it
What I rep, gutter, gutter, I die for this, it's getting ugly
Smash you with bundles, the trash'll trust you
It don't take much to get you rubbed out, you got a lot of mouth
It ain't even built like that, it's real like that
You wanna bring it to the stage, or bring it to the block
It's however you want it, watch you haul 'em out
And split the eight west test, go 'head and call 'em out
But when I see you, I'mma show you what it's all about
No doubt, sublands, where I'm from, crash land
As they come, son, my uzi weighs a ton, hold up
Drop atomic, on phonic, mic bionic
Six Million Dollar man with the plan, to keep the heaters popping
He in the streets, so watch him, closely approaching, be strategic
Please believe it, set it off with no reason
Mob cheating, log on to ww.snipethetasteoutyourmouth.com, the Vietnam
Yo, it's bigger than rap, franchise the label
Pintbox and black tie affair, hands that rock the cradle
Get it? My hopes, so I ain't playing, I'm spraying
Whoever say my name in vein, so what you saying?

[Chorus: Joe Mafia]
Mafia style...
Mafia style...
Mafia style...
Mafia style... style, style

[Joe Mafia]
Now how do I move the crowd?
Let's get it jumping, cousin, not now, but right now
And how I put it down, my rhymes, my lifestyle
Half my Syndicate clicks is waiting on trial, now
Alotta lames on the set, thinking they styling out
Got alot of hate and snake when I'm striving for the top
Gon' reach it with my mic cord, wrapped around your neck
Body hanging, half man tagging on 58 West, west
Straight up, it's no gimmicks
I'm bout it, bout it, so you know 'no limit'
I mastered the flow, to ever diss, it's massacre dance floors
For clapping at rap shows, get ghost, or get low, get toast, get dough
It's felony melodies, I begin show, Waco
Like if you talk snake, I don't know who it is
On the run with this one gunning, stacking the fugitive
Futile attempts get you bent
Spanked at and shanked at rap, for five cent
And on Diamond Street I hold it, atrocious, we boating
Ya'll rappers need to stop it, with all ya'll wack promotions
Ya'll cats ain't iller mine
Plus, your style sucker, you ain't realer than mine

[Chorus]</pre>
