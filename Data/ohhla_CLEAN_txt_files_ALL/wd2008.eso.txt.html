Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Gonna bring out the gorilla in me ya'll

Hear the pistols pump, hear the engine roar
That's my heart and soul, trying to bend the law
It's a beautiful night, to fly like a phoenix
Bang the beat and get high like I'm Jesus

I had a choice
Before I got lost on a canvas
Conform to the norm
Or go off on a tangent
To a field of dreams
We built it with no bucks
So I aimed for the stars
And tilted my scope up

Suddenly

Suddenly at gigs
We were packing the floor
Having 'em roar
It took 2 LP's
To get a crack in the door
Here's Johnny
But I'm happy of course
I talk total true thoughts
When I'm tackling tours
Matter fact, I just rap
Not a cat with a Porsche
I'm a tug-of-war of words
Whirling backwards and forwards
And I can't get enough of this feeling
Blaze the bonfire
Up on this beach and

Welcome to Woodstock 2 double 0 8
You better buckle up, this ride has no breaks
I'm 'a fang the bitch, till it flames out the back
Out of control like a train off it's tracks

You know God damn well
Who burnt the house down
Buried the bullshit
And turned the sound round
B.E.I, we bring it back to Basics
And get the whole crowd ape shit

Well I've been slaving for 5 days
And finally the weekend's arrived
The walls and roof is on fire
Now that's what I call saturday night

See if the vibe is right
And the beat is tight
Trust me my brother we gon' eat tonight
And that's a 7 course meal
For my people in the gutter
If we all can't share
I ain't eating mother f**ker

I went down to the woods
And took a look into my soul and
A kaleidoscope of colours
Started cooking in my couldren
In a dark world I gotta fight
Through the cruel night
Spread my wings
Take flight into moonlight

I'm just basking in the sunshine
Of fates soothing innocence
Painting with a personal pallet
Of moving images
I am my lifes editor
You bet I might be that
Jedi Knight on your red eye flight

Direct like Billy Walsh
I'm in charge like the Dalai Lama
Roll with my Entourage
Like Johnny Drama
Sky surf a computer of destiny
Back at the Bliss batch
Booze and Buddha is the recipe

It's a baboon bash
A barbarian ball
Where we all get together
And we never get bored
Yeah we're clever with the swords
Looked what popped out bitch
Came stomping through your hood
With this knock out shit

Well I've been slaving for 5 days
And finally the weekend's arrived
The walls and roof is on fire
Now that's what I call saturday night

I don't move crack rock
In a fat sock
I move dope rhymes
Snap locked in a laptop
Going 80 on the freeway
Chillin with my DJ
Hot to trot
And we drop with no delay

This is my heart and soul bra
My art and culture
We hold this bitch down
Like Spartan soldiers
So God forsake me for tellin my rhyme
But big Macka does tell it on time

With the sirens blaring
I rock the damn Richter
I'm the fire Aries
The cosmic transmitter

I can't complain
That you don't know my name
And if that's the case
Then baby please let me explain
It be that Lumberjack Macka
And Johnathon Coltrane
Izm in the back
Digging through the wax
Doing his thing

God forsake me
God forsake what we do in the hood
God forsake me
God forsake what we do in the hood
God forsake me
God forsake what we do in the hood
God forsake me
Big Macka is up to no good

Well I've been slaving for 5 days
And finally the weekend's arrived
The walls and roof is on fire
Now that's what I call saturday night

Put the pedal to the metal
I'm on another level
You cannot bring me down
I never settle with the devil
I'm a renegrade rebel
You got to feel me now</pre>
