[Hook Part 1 - Mr. GZus]
When you wanna get this loot (right now)
When you want a Benz coupe (right now)
When you thug niggas gon' shoot (right now, right now, right now)

[Hook Part 2 - Mr. GZus]
When you wanna get these riches (right now)
When you wanna fuck these bitches (right now)
It's time to start killin snitches (right now, right now, right now)

[Verse 1 - Mr. GZus]
The six re-convicted felon drop gems
With the clique heat addiction, pop the first one flinchin
Takin playas out the game, and bench em, then we lynch em
Listenin to Henchmen to finish off the mission (get em)
All my soldiers into position
Son clinchin the coke with his finger itchin
Screamin why his niggas' snitchin
It's the suckas' way of fuckin with my ones
You gonna play with guns, then I got em by the tons
Federal Reserve notes keep me at your throat
You can tell from the smell from the fire that I wrote
Don't test this infectious, cause GZus wreck shit
A tech smith, your last request, next shit, at your residence
Squeeze with no hesitance, stay forever bent - over dead presidents
Commit acts with no malice
Tryin to ball out, before my number call-out
Going all-out, can't wait to hear my niggas shout (shout it out)

[Hook - Part 1]

[Verse 2 - Antonio Twice Thou]
Twist the Philly up
Nigga, what's really up (wassup)
Feel me, throw ya nine-milli up (BOW!)
Guns - get the poppin, forever hip-hoppin
Hot ones clappin, make it happen, with a Mack 10
Wildin, off some liquor
Flee with the heat nigga (yeah)
Tote some weed nigga (yeah)
Slow your speed nigga (yeah)
Throw your hands up high
You a stand-up guy, that won't testify
Best have tried, to come bang with the Made
Compare that, to gun battlin with a switch blade
Hits blazed (hits blazed), shits played in the club
Get mix tape love, so you know it ain't a fake
Was bustin you next, like Russian roulette
You wet, and I don't fear nothin you rep

[Hook Part 2]

[Verse 3 - Benzino]
?Sissy, get lick off, shut off, bust off, hear off?
?Don't you wanna take some?
??
?Don't you wanna take some? (bust it)
Since when you didn't know I was a Made Man
Benzino-Hangman
Don't get caught up in my gang land
?D-techs? still be checkin on my resume'
Still I wet about four niggas anyway
Never worry about defeat cause I roll deep
[pause] Got you runnin down your own street
?So if you wanna get some?
?? (Made Men)

[Hook - Part 1, Part 2]

[Modified Hook - Mr. GZus]
When you wanna blaze it up (right now)
When you want dollar figgas (right now)
Tell me,
when you wanna fuck these niggas (right now, right now, right now)
