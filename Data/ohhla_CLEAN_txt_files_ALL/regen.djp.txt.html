Re:Generation
Composer: DJ Premier
Maestro: Sir Nas
Yeah, Nas in the building, Premier's in the building
Yeah..
This is how we redefine, the music 
Let's go~! 
 
[Nas]
Yeah, y'all know I gets it on, sip a Dom
Clear the throat, wet the palate
Compose a ballad, then expose a rare talent
The kick drum'll have you numb, the snare's valid
That's how Premier styles it
Yeah y'all know he gets it on, that's a given
Every song I've written, make the sky clear blue
like the beginning scenes of The Simpsons
Dominions of the British Empire
We'll listen to Bach, with tea and biscuits
Preem revisits, songs centuries old
Hip-Hop symphonies, orchestras out cold with it
You know the flow's administered
By the deputy rhyme, Prime Minister, Sir Nas I'm certified
Please be seated and your shirt and tie dress is on
Arrive early, when the curtains rise, bet it's on
A certain etiquette involved with this
Unlike any other music genre is, bring the drama in</pre>
