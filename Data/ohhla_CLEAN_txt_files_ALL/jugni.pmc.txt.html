Song:   Jugni
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Jugni ja varhi Punjab
Jithe parhe likhe bekaar
Vech Zameena Javan Bahar
Uthey maran jhadu
Uthey gori len viyah
Pichay tabbar take rah
Veer meriya ve Jugni kehndi aa
Ek Navin Udari Lehndi aa

(Jugni blazed into Punjab
Where the educated are unemployed
Selling off their lands and going abroad
Where they sweep floors
Where they marry a white girl
Back home the family awaits their return
Jugni says, My brother
Today I soar on a new flight)

Jugni ja varhi Bambai
Jithe saunda koi nahin
Sab labhan cheez koi
Kisse kisse nu labhe
Jinnu labhe oh bechain
Matthe vat fir usdey painh
Veer meriya ve Jugni kehndi aa
Ik saah sabar da laindi aa

(Jugni blazed into Bombay
Where no one ever sleeps
And everyone is looking for something
Very few ever find it
Those who find it lose their calm
Lines appear on their forehead
Jugni says, My brother
I heave a sigh of contentment)</pre>
