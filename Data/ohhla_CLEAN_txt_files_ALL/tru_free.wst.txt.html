[Intro] [Kanye Speaking]
Yo, it's Kanye To The
I did this beat in '96 and ah...

Is it the because my beats the nicest
Got me chargin' niggas Dr. Evil prices
Niggas will sell their soul to go platinum and gold
I'm cold cause I got the Go and kick my soul
Drop an album full of soul
Sold twelve times gold that's six plat
Man that's a sick plaque 
Man don't forget that at the top is where you feel the loneliness
Like grabbin' fake titties, I swear I feel the phoniest
Cause I'm from a city where you never know who your homies is
Cause everybody wants your spot
No I.D. told me this
Oh I seen homies get
Sheisty on me quick
Wooooh, just imagine if I only spit?
But I do beats too, that's the American dream
Stack two, make sure my shorties inherit some things
A couple real estate investments
Got niggas sayin', "There's the Kennedy's" 
But oh yes it's, The West's
Brand new Roc-A-Fella
Most fresh to death is
Definitely Kanye 
Peace to Sporty L.A.
That keep my shoe game, early like the grave shift
Plus keep my closet cooped up like a slave ship
How you gon' look at me and say I ain't made shit?
Just look at my outfit, I got all the basics
Air Force, check
Rolex, check
Call G and Hop, did you get the, check?
Roc-a-Fella piece, check
Don't forget the neck
Is it the money on deck
That keeps on the honeys on the dick?
Now that ain't really rhyme
But I ain't really tryin'
Last 9-11 I was poor on the ave
Till I plural my math
Now it's Porsche 9-11's and I'm floorin' on the gas
Got a lot of problems, money's one that I not have
Date ball player's wives, that divorce and got half 
Shit
I figure they deserve somethin' for all them hours
And that be the realest shit I never wrote
Only book I ever read I could have wrote
48 Laws Of Power
Me, G &amp; Hop, uh huh, the game's ours
Seems like I got more brain off my fake chain than my real one
Cause on the real son
If a girl think you broke, she just wanna fuckin' smoke
If you paid, then she's thinkin' bout her children
Feel him?
Probably not though, unless you got doe
You know what I mean?
You will think the grass greener when you finally get green
I told Gina, you ain't been in a Medina
Yeah, I seen you grabbin' on my balls like Serena
Yeah, y'all the invisible hoe, you ain't never seen her
Um huh, she must stay around your grandma's crib
Right next door to where the in-laws live
I brought a man from the fifth floor
All in y'all crib

[Outro] [Kanye Speaking]
Remember niggas back at school, they didn't have no girl at school
so they be like, "I got a girl she just stay by my grandma's crib." Hehe
Yo, Dame, where the fuck you find me?
Hahaha</pre>
