Typed by: DaSun Akbar

(Sample from "Man of La Mancha (1972)")
I will impersonate a man. His name (((Kamach)))
Being retired, he has much time for books
He studies them from morn till night and often through the night and morn again
and all he reads oppresses him
Fills him with indignation at man's murderous ways toward man
He ponders the problem of how to make better a world
where evil brings profit and virtue none at all
He lays down the melancholy burden of sanity
and conceives the strangest project ever imagined

(Intro)
Kamachi!!!!!!!!
Section-8 Egyptian, Supreme Mic Messiah!!!
Ill-Zaar!!!! Kno'm'sain
It's been a long time coming but it's here tho
Kno'm'sain, so we gon' zone the fuck out
Welcome back to hip-hop!

[Chief Kamachi]
YO!!!!!!!!!
I'm live from the infernal regions
I'm here for eternal reasons
These classics I'm breathen
When I die don't casket the heathen
Power contained in these ashes I'm leaving
A mystery more then half of the global masses believe in
I'm a street Christ to rise over the hood in the evening
Smoke an L, laugh at little Lorraine, get her weaving
On the steps in this dilapidated Garden of Eden
With a vocal gat, started unleashing and they started retreating
From indiscriminate murders penmanship
Set my time was limited, Kamach! Nigga remember it!
Yo! Appreciate, respect the great!
The way my flow affect the tape
It's serious as drug, dough in section-8
Preaching he need cash for his collection plate
Bury me, I'm mic mummy in linen bandages
History deep like when we did hustlers from where Atlantis is
Colorful Nubian imagery from mental canvases
Angels wobble their halos like...
Do you know what jam this is?
Fuck it! That's some crazy shit
Before vocal booth, alright!!
In my precocious youth, I snap with a ferocious tooth
It's Kamach!!!
The soldier, I stay humble and serene
Mysterious like the jungles in Benin
Came in this world and the people hear love what they seen
Like they went back to sleep and rediscovered their dreams
Chief is the nicest!!

(Outro)
I'm not fucking playing wit'chall
Kno'm'sain, Ill-Zaar!
Section-8 Egyptian! Supreme Mic Messiah!
It's Cult Status!!
Yeah, need I say more? Need I say more?</pre>
