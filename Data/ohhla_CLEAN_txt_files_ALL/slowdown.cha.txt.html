[Intro/Chorus]
She say she love the way I take control, first in slow motion
Then I speed it up and stroke it now
Slow it down, slow it down, slow, it, down
Now switch it up now
She said I always was the best befo', with the slow motion
But the difference is I'm focused now
Slow it down, slow it down, slow, it, down
Then speed it up now

[Chamillionaire]
Speed it up, uh
I got a genie in a bottle you can rub on
I call it Henny it'll help you get ya love on
This is the closest that she gettin to a love song
Pull out my dick and tell her welcome to the love zone
In general I'm a general to you lieutenants
Landlord, bad women are my new tenants
Runnin round causin trouble like the new +Dennis+
+The Menace+ in your girl mouth like her new dentist
(Woo~!) Uhh, get a cavity check
You little internet nerds don't have any sex
I come and get her in the Rover, the Caddy, the Lex
She take a pic I bet I'm gettin her panties to stretch
Yup! I hope you're makin it on my list
You'll never meet another player as cold as this
The second that you ever let me control your hips
I'm deadly and as venomous as a cobra kiss; switch

Slow it down, known to spit
If that's yo' girl better grab her quick
Keep tellin me that she the baddest chick
That translate 'til she wants my magic stick
Grab the whip, slab a kit
Wood in my slab like a cabinet
Tryin trap me I ain't havin it
I keep a cap on my head like a graduate (trick!)
Graduation, congratulations
Beat turnt up so the slab was shakin
Police nah, I don't add the bacon
Plenty of the grams that I'm tabulatin
Gravitation, on the rise
Lookin for a chick with some swollen thighs
Piece in my drawers really oversized
If they told you it's not (then they told you lies)

Switch it up in slow mo', I ain't sweatin no hoe
+Krusty+ like the clown ya man looking like a +Bozo+
She can get the bozack, he can get the fo'-fo'
Burn off in my whip while hittin switches like a cholo
Superfast and slow mo', I be in the zone though
Off Universal still creepin on the low low
Lizard for the logo, trickin is a no no
For me and her to kick it like some ninjas at a dojo
Uh, she bounce on it like a pogo stick
while I stick to the script on you lames
I always been the poster child of grippin the grain
I always been the President of gettin the change
The flow switch and it change, then I switch it to slow
You can't get in her mind, I already got in the do'
To be specific I'm livin the way I live in my flow
And now they know I'm the player your woman gettin to know
Let's go

[Chorus]

[Chamillionaire - singing]
Mmmmm, this type of love so off the chain (off the chain)
(So off the chain) cause I ain't gotta remember yo' name (yo' name)
(Hold up!) And I ain't gotta buy you anytang (nah)
I'm a do it like a pro baby
I'm a take it slow cause you knowin that you ain't my dame, ain't my dame
(Hold up mane!) Don't think just cause you lookin good (lookin good)
(Don't even) That I'ma be your ticket out the hood (out the hood)
(Don't need ya) Girl I think there's somethin you should know
(Hold up) You can't be my number one
You can be my number fo' and I think that we should take it slow

[Chamillionaire]
All my broads stay in search of facts
That mean a real man that can work the stacks
Me and Ben Franklin the birth of macks
Want a double date? He the perfect catch
Get a hair cut, then reverse the cap
Took off the top, then convert the back
Black red bottoms with the skirt to match
I ain't talkin 'bout her, that refer to 'llac
I don't ride on no teenage wheels
Open my trunk you'll see eight kills
She got curves plus she in heels
Say that he hers, but she ain't his
I created the term C.O.D.
I ain't seen a real rapper since P-A-T
I ain't heard a real rapper since P-A-C
Some of these other boys cool, but he ain't me, uhh

[Chorus]

[talking over Chorus]
Yeah, switch it up like
That's the difference
I'm sorry but this the closest it get to a love song ladies
Ha ha~! Engine's on and we out like... (now)</pre>
