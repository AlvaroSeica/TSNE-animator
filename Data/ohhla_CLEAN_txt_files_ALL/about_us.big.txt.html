(Chorus x 2)
Now what about us
Ooh they got us fucked up
They forgot about us
Ooh they got us fucked up

I went to jail cause they say that I be selling that yae
They hate to see a young black nigga trying to get paid
Get on the phone, call my mama and my lawyer
And tell all them hoes, I'm fuckin send me some money order
Cause I'm gonna be hear a while, ain't getting out
I should've never brought my black ass to the south,
I can't make bail cause I ain't got no bonds
They ain't gonna give me no bonds cause they know I'm gonna run
These white bitches will make nigga ass feel it
They got me fucked up, so now I gotta deal wit it
They wanna make a deal, bitch I ain't no fuckin squealer
They say I'm a kingpin and a fire arm dealer
The kingpin is the white boy that locked me up
He got the whole fuckin neighborhood sowed up
Take twenty years for some shit you can't prove
Just because I'm black, you think that I'm a damn fool
No dope, no guns, no case, let's take this shit to trial
Mr. Bigg versus the state, and then I still might not win
Because I know they wanna send me to the pen

(Chorus x 2)

I'm riding on the muthafuckin van
With two handcuffs on my muthafuckin hands
I'm on my way to court, trying to see what they going to give me
My homies in the court room holler if ya hear me
My bitches on the back row, crying and shit
This muthafuckin judge trying to offer me a ten split
I ain't taking shit, cause you ain't got no evidence
Tell the grand jury they can suck my muthafuckin
Riding on the muthafuckin bus
On my way to prison, but I don't give a fuck
They shaved my face, and cut the hair up off my head
And gave me a blanket and a sheet for a muthafuckin bunk bed
Three t-shirts and three pairs of socks
A bar stain soap, toothpaste, and a padlock
I'm settled in now it's time for me to creep
I finally meet some niggas, that I knew from when I was on the street
Mr. Bigg how much time you got?
I heard you had twenty years and you ain't never getting out
Telling me I need Jesus, muthafuckas get locked up
Now they wanna be preachers,
I cant pray cause I don't know how
I wasn't saved on the streets
So who can fuckin save me now
But when I hit the streets again
I won't forget about my homies in the pen

(Chorus x 2)

Over by the softball field
Chumps telling lies about the niggas they done killed
And all of the keys that they flew from overseas
And all of the weed that they grew in Tennessee
Lying about there homes and they testerosed kits,
But those same hoes, haven't never sent you shit
I reminisce late at night laying in my bed
Thinking about the shit my mama once said
Never trust a nigga and never trust a woman
And never fuck a bitch unless you getting something from her
A lot of niggas bawl because they give them hoes their heart
The same niggas I see crying in the dark
You gave that bitch your house
You gave that bitch your home
Now you in the pen and now that bitch gone
Spending up your money while you stuck behind a wall
Stankin ass bitch won't accept your phone call

(Chorus x 2)</pre>
