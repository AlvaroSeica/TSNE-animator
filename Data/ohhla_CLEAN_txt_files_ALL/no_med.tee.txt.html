[Intro: T.I.]
Hmm, yeah, mm-hmm, uh-huh
Ay, ay, okay, hmm, okay
Real talk, true spit nigga
{"Mustard on the beat, hoe"}

[Chorus: T.I.]
All I fuck is bad bitches, I don't want no mediocre
D-don't want no mediocre, I don't want no mediocre
No - bad bitches only, ain't no mediocre
D-don't want no mediocre, I won't hit no mediocre
You a, bad bitch, stuntin on the mediocre
On the mediocre, you stunt on the mediocre
Seven, b-bitches with me and none of 'em mediocre
From they head to they toes they so far from mediocre, yeah

[T.I.]
Right hand in the air, I solemnly swear
I never fuck a bitch if she don't do her hair
No more, and you won't get no dick if there's a bush down there
Girl I should see nothin but pussy when I look down there
Hey come fuck with a nigga, what better to do
He call and ask you how you doin, tell him "Better than you"
Yeah, I'm kicked back with four pieces like a Kit Kat
Me fuckin if you ain't a dime, just forget that
Pretty face, fat ass, if she don't have
Have one of these, well I think I'll pass
I just, handed her the keys to a new drop Jag
When she took it I took it back, you shoulda asked for a Benz
That's mediocre bitch

[Chorus] w/ ad libs

[Iggy Azalea]
Heard he wanna lay it down on Iggy Iggy
Gave it to him twice, now he want a 3, Mike Bibby diva
But I need a bad boy, rest in peace Whitney
Pardon me but I don't think none of these bitches fuckin with me
Want a Billboard bitch? Stop runnin in place
Heels on me sayin gimme six inches of space
Courtside while designer frames cover my face
Now everybody in the game wanna get 'em a taste
I'm still Grand Hustle first lady, fuck you pay me
Bet he won't go 12 rounds with the million dollar baby
I can +Change Your Life+ quick, stop playin with me
And if you ain't talkin money, what you sayin to me?

[Chorus]

[T.I.]
Ay, I'm in Brazil with a bitch
Catch me in a mansion in the hills with a bitch
Get her out them tennis shoes, throw some heels on a bitch
I'm the type of nigga split a meal with a bitch
Hold up, only if she bad though
Out here tryin to find someone that's better than my last hoe
Take her to my castle, drown her in my cash flow
Say your dick's so little she can fit it in her asshole
Told me she can't ride that shit no further than a cab go
Said I got that don dick, she wanna be my tutor
So she give me brain, gettin head on the scooter
Had sex on the beach from Bermuda up to Cuba
I done fucked a lot of dimes but I'm lookin for a cute bitch
"You the shit," what she said when she got to sit
When I ain't around give a damn who you do it with
Super thick, pretty face, ménage-à-veinte
20 at the same time, wanna get ya rent paid?

[Chorus] w/ ad libs</pre>
