[Joan Rivers]
Listen... I wish I could tell you it gets better, but...
It doesnÄôt get better -- YOU get better.
You think it's been easy? I've gone up, I've gone down
I've been bankrupt, I've been broke, but you do it.
And you do it because... because we love it more than anything else.
That's why you doin' it. You want a real job, honey?
There are a million things you can do, but what we do is not a job.
It sounds so stupid... what we do... is a calling, my dear.
We make people happy. It's a calling.
 
{Amel Larrieux sample}
Mmm, a-la da da.. Da da dum...
Da-da-da, dum dum dum
(One, two, three, four)
 
[Chorus: Amel Larrieux]
I know you're down - when you gon' get up?
I see you're down - When you gon' get up?
I know you're down - When you gon' get up?
I see you're down - When you gon' get up?
 
[Danny!]
(Wish that I could tell you it gets better)
Man, it's kinda hard to stay positive
Positivity only gets you but so far
Shoot for the stars, you'll mess around get hit by a car
That's just the cynicism season me (me)
How am I supposed to motivate
when half these motherfuckers don't believe in me? (When you gon' get up?)
 
[Amel Larrieux]
Ooooooooh, oooh-oooh-oooooooooh
Ooooooooh, oooh-oooh-oooooooooh
 
[Danny!]
How am I supposed to motivate
when half these motherfuckers don't believe in me?
Uh!
 
[Chorus]
 
[Danny!]
(Wish that I could tell you it gets better)
I see I'm tryna work the system
But I'm wanna make the system work for me
We're all connected through our imperfections
Oxygenarians to Junior in the nursery
Word, to say it's easy to be a leader is misleading (naw)
We need some good examples from the time that we teethin
to be the change that we wanna see
That's why I never bother entertainin these wannabes
I know my own worth and everyone should know their own
Irresponsible youth'll cause a mayhem
when they really need a confidence boost
I wanna be the one they look up to, but every now and then
I wake up in the morning, need some confidence too
Uh, sucks but it's true
Lil' nigga with big dreams, it sucks to be you
 
[Chorus and Amel Larrieux singing ad-libs 'til end]
 
[Danny!]
Aiyyo, turn off that backpack Kumbaya bullshit, man
Roll some fuckin weed up</pre>
