[Young Jeezy]
Yeah, what! {Mustard on the beat ho~!}

R.I.P, it's the remix killer 
Mike Jack was alive, I'd remix "Thriller" (yeeeah)
Trap star, bitch, spell it with a big T (T)
Give a damn if I never be a hot MC (Ha-haaa)
Cause I'm a hood nigga, first on everybody's list (YEAH)
Buy the whole club P, don't fuck with no Cris (daaamn)
That average ass watch can't fuck with my wrist (nope)
Them average ass hoes can't fuck with my bitch (nah)
To the window, to the motherfuckin' wall (wall)
Enough money in my jeans to buy a motherfuckin' mall (It's Tha World, nigga))
Got the choppas in the back, bulletproof, that's my Hummer
R.I.P. to the competition, this is my summer (let's go!)

[Y.G.]
YG FO' HUNNID~!
R.I.P, I wanna kill the judge (judge)
Tryna lock the homie up, they don't feel the thug
I'm thirsty, but I don't give a fuck
Fuckin' with my ex cause I'm still in love
Uh, I can teach you how to fuck and how to stack money
I ain't went Hollywood, you just act funny
But I know you want this pipe like a crack bummy
Stop playin', I'm tryna hit like a crash dummy
Don't start no shit, it won't be no shit

[Young Jeezy]
I can't take yo bitch if I don't see yo bitch (nah)
We done seen that snow, Nat Geo bitch (Ha-haaa)
Cancel her and get another like I'm Nino bitch (let's go!)

[Chorus 2X: Young Jeezy]
R.I.P. (yeah) R.I.P. (yeah)
R.I.P. (yeah) R.I.P (what)
R.I.P., we just killed the club
Took patron to the head, almost killed a thug

[Kendrick Lamar]
Turnt up in this bitch and I'm beamin' and shit
Hundred hoes, hundred fold, this my season and shit
Stomach on belly roll, bitch I'm eatin' and shit
You a vegan and shit, get off my penis and shit
Look a bad bitch, I back that bitch nigga back back
Pull it out the grab bag, turn this ho to Baghdad
Bags on my eyes, I don't sleep much, we up
Bitch I beat the beat up, the homies get you beat up
And R.I.P to P-Nut, Little Eric, get back
Mausberg, 4 Bent, Compton I live that
Long hair weave with exten-sions
Glock 17 with exten-sion
Bumpin' Suga Free in the automatic dually
T.V.'s in it like it's '97, watch a porno movie
Holla Chitty Chitty Bang, this is Com-Town gang
Fuck whoever don't like it, lil' K-Dot be the name, bitch

[Chorus]

[Chris Brown]
Look, R-R-R.I.P. to the V.I.P
I got my lil' niggas in the club, fuck I.D
My niggas kill at will, give you black eyed peas
And the molly make the white girl look Chinese
Okay, O.H.B., my niggas out here ballin'
And all these fake ass artists, y'all niggas out here drawin'
Ok now dearly departed I bought a plane, I departed
And if you started from the bottom gon' head and come out the closet
You problematic, I bought them ratchets and automatics
Clip hold 32, I make you feel the Magic
You gon' see the flashes, like you in a pageant
All black suits, and them long Caddys

[Chorus] - 2X</pre>
