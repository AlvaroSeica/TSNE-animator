Typed by: AZ Lyrics

She don't need a nigga permission

[Verse 1]
She don't need my permission
Born in 1988
My new addition
Singing you're new still around
I need somebody who can stand by me
Hold up! shut up!
Who the fuck am I kidding?
That's that deuce ain't talking
Hold up come back
I'm just singing
This can't work go figure
First girl I met that ain't a gold digger
Can I love a stripper?
Can I bring you around my niggas
Sean, Chris, Pusha my niggas
Will I have to defend you?
To be continued...

Maybe all I need is you and I'll be ok
It's something about your spirit
That seems around the way
My monster fucking profession
My monster fucking profession

[Verse 2]
Oh what would it take to make you happy
Don't hesitate to let me know
Tell me what are you lookin for exactly
Open up your mouth and let a nigga know
Baby won't you tell me please
What I can do to make you smile again
Just say the word and baby I will do
Whatever it takes for me to pray to your days
So baby what do you say

[Chorus]
She told me what she wanted what to understand
She on the paper chase and need them rubber bands
Now I'm like damn girl you should've said so
What you think I'm stacking these 1's for
Get your ass on that dance floor
And watch me make this cash flow 'cause
Bands make her dance
Bands make her dance
All these chicks poppin pussy
I'm just poppin bands
Bands make her dance
Bands make her dance
These chicks clapping
And they ain't using hands

[Verse 3]
If all that it takes is spending some cake
Then go and take your clothes off don't need to make me wait
Girl I can keep you dancing all night if you like
'Cause you be working hard doing everything I like
That's why I gon get you right
Girl I'm gon get you right
'Cause your body looks so nice
And you be tellin me tonight
I'm gonna dance for you
Baby what can I do for you

[Chorus]
She told me what she wanted what to understand
She on the paper chase and need them rubber bands
Now I'm like damn girl you should've said so
What you think I'm stacking these 1's for
Get your ass on that dance floor
And watch me make this cash flow 'cause
Bands make her dance
Bands make her dance
All these chicks poppin pussy
I'm just poppin bands
Bands make her dance
Bands make her dance
These chicks clapping
And they ain't using hands

Bands make her dance
Bands make her dance
All these chicks poppin pussy
I'm just poppin bands
Bands make her dance
Bands make her dance
These chicks clapping
And they ain't using hands</pre>
