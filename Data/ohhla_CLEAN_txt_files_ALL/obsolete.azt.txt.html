Song:   Obsolete Man
Typed by: prince@macmail.com

Drain me, suck the life from me
Now my body weeps like an old willow tree
They¹re taking my life, they¹re taking my individuality
I¹ve become another one of the unknowns
No individuals, just company clones
They think for me now
They think for me now
They took my life and I don¹t know how
I live to work and I work to live
But they want it all and I have no more to give
It¹s a ritual, religious its all the same
I¹m not crazy, just a little bit insane
Locked in when the card slides through
Let the games begin now I¹m turning blue
Suffocated
Cuz I¹m choking on a check
Desecrated
Cuz I have no self-respect
They took my name and gave me a 4 digit number
My spirit is tamed by the one I work under

Chorus:

You can take my life but you¹ll never take my soul
Healing, I¹m not willing
I need control
I¹m an obsolete man
In a web of conformity you find yourself caught
Welcome to the world survivors of the onslaught
Question the things all the things you¹ve been taught
Your body, your mind, commodity you are not
Cuz flesh and blood is all that you got
Becuz flesh and blood is all that you got
Becuz flesh and blood is all that you got!!!
It was painful when I realized
My oppression and my daily disguise
I was not happy when I opened my eyes
I was not happy when I opened my eyes!!!
Cada dia de tu vida trabajas pa vivir
Faltas control pero hay que subsistir
Y pensando lo bien eso es la realidad
No tienes tus derechos y menos la dignidad
Pero siquiera en la mesa tienes la comida
Viviendo como esclavo por el resto de tu vida!
Viviendo como esclavo por el resto de tu vida!!
Viviendo como esclavo por el resto de tu vida!!!</pre>
