Together: 
now if you want some you best come with a gun
you cant fuck with the tongue or the way the song is sung 
by lateef and blackalicious we keep it fat, delicious

you cant be idle you best come trifle 
but even with a rifle your stylell get stifled
  
lateef: quick
  
gab:
lateef and blackalicious we coming for that dough to get
the lyrics that we wrote again 
are sounding rather vicous beyond scientific 
I'll snap like a doberman I'm unable to hold it in 
I really hope you feel it, check it out
droppin the topic and me apocaplypse 
hip hop metroplis we stalkin mcs 
dont stop this marvelous three partners 
this bottomless beat has opened wideness 
invitin us inside of its deep rhythmic enviroment 
a labryinth its violent beings just won't be silent 
and higher, and higher means to a world  (?)
where all I need is prez 
and that is my rent 
just by fatting the rest
who wont admire it
wont rule as a tyrant
dont condone  viloence 
till the next man trys it
dont tax no pirate 
just watch as I begin to shape your world
all mcs in the land spanked and baked and broiled 
charred and seasoned in a pan - damn
awakened world stagnant even though they always been there 
laggin about exposing it to the hearing impaired establishment 
raw energy they cant be compared 
tag em then we drag them then we finshed - yeah
  
together:
Now if you want some you best come with a gun
you cant fuck with the tongue or the way the song is sung 
by lateef and blackalicious we keep it fat; delicious
complete and grant your wishes
so peep the rap and listen
you cant be idle you best come trifle 
but even with a rilfe your stylell get stifled
  
lateef: quick
  
let it hit them 
the suffocation begins your soul it gets engulfed in
the sound like its emotion it works just like a potion 
it hurts just like thats only motion gotta think about some rules
see it cant just all be coastin
get to get the spectrum of the wave 
whenever you know its flowin 
got a notion and its deep keep it growing like the ocean dont get salty 
its just me get a dose thats instantaneous essential constantly
fits like a constellation glowing natrually in facts you see the past 
the future marches on triumphantly defiantly  relentlessly 
if it aint one thing its somethin something else 
the instrumental that contributes to your mental health 
as for most mcs we moving like a ninja that is killin ya stealthily 
handle your bizness candidly fool we gigantic globally locally 
and organically aint nothing you gonna do thats gonna damage me 
in this currency its tragedy we value beyond champion originality
is this shit thats happen 
we trigger an emotional response causes you to react violently 
yeah we trigger an emotional response causes you to react violently 
  
together:
Now if you want some you best come with a gun
you cant fuck with the tongue or the way the song is sung 
by lateef and blackalicious we keep it fat; delicious
complete and grant your wishes
so peep the rap and listen

but even with a rifle your stylell get stifled

and even with a rifle your styell get stifled - yeah
