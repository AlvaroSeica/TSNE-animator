[ VERSE 1 ]
Now this is a difficult subject 
About something that's crazy - oh, what the heck
They know they have something that people don't like 
And they still continue to disrespect
The thing I'm talkin about is an essence 
A foreign fragrance with a presence
That you can't see with the naked eye
But to the nose it's a nuisance
It comes in so many forms, it's camouflaged 
And it will sneak upon you like espionage
You might not know it cause it won't show it
And you will swear it's just a mirage
It can be with you when you're talkin 
It will be so close, you think it's hawkin
With a bit of a twang it got its own slang
Is even known in New York, and
Everybody know what I'm sayin 
&gt;From here to the Himalayan
If you don't know, you must be doo-doo
This is what I'm sayin
About the dragon

[ VERSE 2 ]
I think i should go more into depth 
About a secret that is quiet as kept
If you have it like Richochet Rabbit
It can ruin your rep
There are ways of preventin this 
Check your hygenie and your dentist
You might think I'm messin, but this is a lesson
Godliness is cleanliness
But if you think I'm misguiding you 
By sayin there's somethin inside of you
That bothers everybody when you're at a party 
And your reactions to it is: "pee you!"
You're sittin there baffled and puzzled 
Whatever you have, you wish you was muzzled
But if you want a clue, between me and you
It could be the beverage you guzzle
But if you listen to me 
The diabolical energetical B
The i-z Mza-Mza-a-r-k-i-e 
I'm tryina give you h-e-l-p
So I'ma end it off like this 
Before you give somebody a kiss
For the one you adore, check them before 
You get a crazy whiff
Of the dragon

[ VERSE 3 ]
I once knew a guy by the name of Tock
He was one of them kids from like around the block
The kid was cool, had the right gear, and slim 
The only thing was wrong, he smelled like a gym
In secret tellin rumours, his right guard went left
And his band was playin a song that was funky to def
He was kickin like Bruce Lee and Jim Kelly
Word is bond, that kid was smelly
Even if he would shower and shower
Or sprinkle a day, wouldn't last for a hour
He would always wanna like hang around
His underarms had bass with scents around
I tried to tell him, but he just wouldn't listen
He thought from my heart I was tryin to diss him
I started beatin around the bush cause he thought I was naggin
I said, "Yo Tock, you got the dragon!"</pre>
