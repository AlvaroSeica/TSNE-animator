[Intro: Twista]
Here I come
"The Perfect Storm"
Twista

[Twista]
I'm about to take everybody back to the basics
I'm historical, a oracle, a event is about to occur 
because a motherfucker put these raps in the matrix
And I'm a terror when I spit it, dope tracks full of hatred
But it's beauty in the dark, just put it in your mouth 
and the flow is mmmm, like that when you taste it
Come at niggaz like a disciple of death
You would think I'm poppin a rifle or Tec, I'm aimin right for the neck
Your momma might as well call up the funeral home 
so she can write 'em a check, a violent dialect
That's why they feelin me
A trilogy of horror is what I become so they call me Jason Vorhees
Oops, I mean Jason More Cheese, niggaz gotta pay some more fees
Hot enough to break a thermometer from another planet
I kill 'em from here to Andromeda
A comet'll hit the planet when I'm in it
I mean a rapper swallow you with diabolical astonisher
Astronomer because I'm out on the galaxy
Challenge me I will dissintigrate your body like a particle
Follow you into a corridor at 4 in the mornin 
so I can horrify you right before I slaughter you
A voice said they don't think I'm comin with it 
so you know a nigga gotta get 'em all
Then I'ma be, murderin 'em like a serial killer 
then I'ma hide 'em in the ceiling and the wall, fuck 'em all
Niggaz'll never get next to this, I rock a Roley so I flex the wrist
I'ma blow up and sit in yo' place 
and throw up shit in yo' face like "The Exorcist"
You can't mess with this

[Chorus 2X: Twista]
Now let's take shit back to the basics, how we used to do shit
with the original sound but still somehow comin with that new shit (new shit)
Talkin 'bout the way it ain't no morals or respect in the streets no mo' (no mo')
Don't pause with the heat no mo' 
cause it really ain't nothin out here to eat no mo' (no mo')

[Twista]
Nowadays niggaz actin like they lovin to die (why?)
Used to be some respect but now they just kill 'em and stank 'em 
cause Benjamin Franklin the governor now
Theoretically you better be ahead of everybody 
around you cause a nigga might fuck you
Don't need to be nothin but killers in your family 
to always surround you cause a nigga might touch you
Since the recession it been hard on the streets 
so a nigga comin hard on the beats
No order in the hood, I remember when niggaz'll get into it 
they would have to take problems or chief
Now they don't give a fuck who they be shootin or who they be robbin 
or what you ride, all they really care about is who got that
And if you love one of these knucklehead bitches 
know you sittin on somethin muh'fuckers is gon' be at that
South-siiide mur-derers
It's the West-siiide kill-ers
Up north and over east is a beast
What they released be leavin you deceased
Fuck up anybody that try to do damage act like it's the planet 
and shorties is too buck for it to be peace
So I carry a piece, but I don't wanna shoot it 
cause I already wanna see some of my niggaz locked up in jail home
Instead of hollerin at 'em on a cell phone
R.I.P. cause my lil' brother Rell gone
Gotta show a different way to get it 
instead of bein on the attack full of hatred
Or get smacked in the face with 
the reality of death if we don't get back to the basics

[Chorus]</pre>
