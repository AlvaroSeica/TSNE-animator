[Intro: Serani]
It's it's, it's it's
It's Serani, and Bun B

[Chorus: Serani]
When the heat is on we burn hotter than - FIRE!!
People will burn up on, we burn hotter than - FIRE!!
Turn my enemies to dust, burn them up with - FIRE!!
Whether life or death, just pop off and - FIRE!!
Pop off and

[Bun B]
Murder murder redrum - mami I gone dead them
Rude bwoy lick a shot and take his motherfuckin head from
his shoulders, this is Bedlam, mayhem, chaos
Competition cease and sekkle, already they lost
Thinkin they boss, like the Triple C's C.E.O.
Fuck 'em, they'll be D.O.A. A.S.A.P., you see me hoe (me hoe)
B-U-N B, O.G., that's why the fuck they duckin me
Rude bwoy, now deal with the fuckery, we buckin G (G)
The ghetto red hot, the youth dem no care
Play pussy (pussy) then let off mad shots inna the air (air)
Motherfucker beware (beware) 'til I retire or expire
It's I and I, and dem know that we-a come with more fire!

[Chorus]

[Rick Ross]
Big belly man, big belly man man (boss)
Big belly man, I'm that, big belly man (Ross)
Big black Benz, 20% tints
100 niggaz on my team, 20% friends
After four or five lines you know this organized crime (me)
Still buyin jewels, I got on more than last time (see?)
This not a pasttime (no) this a landslide
And I'm bringin more fire, better get your hands high (believe!)
Get out my Beamer, knew I like my trigger finger crew
Get with a boss and maybe you could get a Beamer too
Burnin down the strip from Texas to Kingston
As a dime stand in line just dyin to squeeze in
Ross

[Chorus]

[2 Chainz]
2 Chainz!
Who want to test this? Tity 2 Necklace
Money so tall she gotta count it in Giuseppes
Ballin like the ESPY's, drinkin on that Texas
Sextin, textin, aggravated flexin (tell 'em!)
Did it for the money and the fame came with it (TRU)
Connect from the island and the 'caine came with 'em (TRU)
Rode through the block in a cherry colored drop
Jim Carrey, Mariah Carey, you get carried out (damn!)
They got a stretcher with your name on
Shoot a nigga and I'll +Dash+ like Damon (yeah)
Insane in the membrane
2 Chainz, but today I got on three chainz

[Chorus]
