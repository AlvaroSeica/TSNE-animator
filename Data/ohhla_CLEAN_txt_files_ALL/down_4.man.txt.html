[MC Man]
Down for the brown
Yeah

[MC Man]
The definition of brown is a soldier like Emiliano Zapata
Pancho Villa, that's why I keep it real for my Raza
As I stand on my own two with my hand on my gun
Always down for my land cuz a real man would never run
Out of strength or out of potential
I'm always feeding my mental as I put it on the instrumental
Teaching my people right from wrong
Because Latinos are tired of the same old song
They can take away my gun but they can't take away my pain
Cuz when minorities menace it's time to do it again
They try and lock us all up cuz they're scared of the revolution
And then they try to blame us for drug distribution
We don't own no factories and we don't own no planes
California ain't the place that they grow cocaine
All my thoughts have been foc, yes my time has been spent
Now I really figured out who's the real immigrant
It ain't me, it's you the boys in blue
And the devil in that white European too
And no you know player hater that this land is brown
The home of the Aztec where the indian was found
I'm taking back what is mine like I said in the past
I'm always down for my gente and I ain't never scared to blast
From the end of the world back to East Oakland
MC Man and Lighter Shade got a real master plan
Like an Aztec warrior I'm putting it down
I'm letting all my homies know that I'm down for the brown

[Chorus: MC Man &amp; DTTX]
We're putting it down for the brown from LA to the town
Cuz we're brown and proud and that's the way it's going down
We're putting it down for the brown from LA to the town
Cuz we're brown and proud and that's the way it's going down
We're putting it down for the brown from LA to the town
Cuz we're brown and proud and that's the way it's going down
We're putting it down for the brown from LA to the town
Cuz we're brown and proud and that's the way it's going down

[DTTX]
I'm keeping it real with my peeps in the streets
Representing for life and everyday of the week
So check it, it's from the IE to the Bay
Set up in Oaktown, in LA my gente back me all the way
Right, living life brown and proud for sure, one hundred percent straight
We're regulating from the gates
To flip the script something major
Spreading the word as I swerve and everywhere that I serve
To heat it up like the sun
From the Mid East to Aztlan I'm dedicated till I'm gone
It's got me caught up in the game
Just living my life in the body of the set you claim
See my get down is brown
We're putting it down when I come around
Check it

[Chorus]</pre>
