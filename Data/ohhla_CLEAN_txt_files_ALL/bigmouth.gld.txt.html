[Santigold]
Tick-tock tock I shoot non-stop
Tip-toe don't make you rock
What they say that's not 'nough
You long long what you know I got
Blah blah blah against the wall
So Pee Wee cyber tall
Ring ring ring when duty calls
Now now not word at all

[Chorus 1]
Big mouth, big mouth
Quiet now, you've said enough
Got a big mouth, big mouth
My my my, you've said enough - what's that you said?

[Chorus 2]
See the world, but watch it tear me up
See the world, but watch it tear me up
What's that you said?
See the world, but watch it tear me up

[Santigold]
Deep down don't know what you want
Dismount throw me up front
Be red but got no guts
You strong strong, why play debutante?
Ga, ga, ga, all slightly off
Not me, I'll take the loss
See see see, doesn't it be off
Bomber wonder what's not lost

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2] - repeat 2X

[Santigold]
You're everywhere I go, thinkin that you know {*3X*}
Hey go off, go you, go lead it if you know

[Chorus 2]</pre>
