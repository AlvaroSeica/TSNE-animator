[Verse One]
Here I go again
Drifting from home
And I'm all alone
Driving on the 10
Freeway late at night
Going towards the shore
But what the hell for
Cause all we gonna do is fight

[Chorus]
I'm pretending what I feel
Trapped inside, what's not real
And you tell me all I need to know
Yet it blows away 
And I'm all a-

[Verse Two]
And here I am
Standing at your door
Just like before
Cause it's all a game
They named us as pawns
And we're pros at this
That's when we kiss
And lost what was gone
Gasping for air
Searching for ground
Sinking in my sound
But there's nothing there

[Chorus] [x2]
I'm pretending what I feel
Trapped inside what's not real
And you tell me all i need to know, but

And I'm all alone [8x] 
And I'm all a-

[Verse Three]
I'm sorry now
What was I to do?
I'm way past blue
Makes me wonder how
Could I sink so deep?
Drowning in my tears
Can't even see my peers
I think I'll go to sleep

[Chorus] [x4]
I'm pretending what I feel
Trapped inside what's not real
And you tell me all I need to know, but

And I'm all alone
I am near you, I am near you my son
My son, My son
My dear son, My son
Come home, Come home
My dear son
Come home, Come home</pre>
