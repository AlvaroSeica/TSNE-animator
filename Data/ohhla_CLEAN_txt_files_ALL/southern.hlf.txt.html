[Lil' 1/2 Dead]
I met me an girl in another land
She was fine and so thick from the southern land
She had it going on from my head to feat
With the perfect hair dew and her voice was sweat
Patique just how her body was big
In the country green grass it what we cheep
In the park in the dark and try to spark an joint
Skip the bull shit get to the point
I was bumping and grinding trying to find my space
Im kissing my baby all over her face
Yes indeed was soft like fur, boy did I like to make love to her
Everyday and every night you see
Man that pussy was so bomb to me
And she's the only to rock my world
Man I can't wait to see my southern girl

[Lil' 1/2 Dead Chorus]
Southern Girl
I want to rub ya, kiss ya, squeeze ya, hug ya
You really got it going on and I just love my yellow bone
Southern Girl
I want to rub ya, kiss ya, squeeze ya, hug ya
I love it when your next to me and you always giving bomb sex to me

[Lil' 1/2 Dead]
Now me and my girl be getting it on
From the late, late night to the break of dawn
We be putting it down like yes indeed
Then I take some braids so I can twist my weave
You see to handle my business loc
Straight putting the stroke down and it aint no joke
I be loving when she squeeze my back
Then she kiss me and I kiss her back
In fact she really likes when I bump
She be telling me her ex man a punk
Cause he aint got stroke like I do
She be saying "Baby I aint lying to you"
Then I ask her if she love me loc
Straight putting the smash down with every stroke
Everytime I hit it make her eyes swirl
Man I can't wait to touch my southern girl
[Lil' 1/2 Dead Chorus]

[Lil' 1/2 Dead]
My southern girl she's the one
When I say do something she get's it done
With no back talk because she don't talk back
She straight listen when I kicks my fact
Like that, I be telling her my good and bad shit
Let her know that I never had shit
And im trying do my best to get's mine
That's why im on the corner grind
So me and you can't live life straight and see your face, I just can't wait
Because you got it going on and I love ya
I would never disrespect or even shove ya
Because you are my number one lady 
And you really love me because I aint shady
And we going to be on top of the world 
Just me and you my sweat southern girl
