[Intro/Chorus One: Bobby V]
I wanna do you at your momma house, on the couch
Do you in the bathroom of the airplane
Do you on a balcony, in the ta-xi
Cause I can't get enough of that thang

[Nicki Minaj]
Yo, yo
Let's do up in Disney at the Magic Kingdom
You can tug on my Giuseppes and my Badgley Mischkas
I'm a buh-buh-buh, I'ma bag of fun
I'm a pro with them balls like AND-1
Now let's go, Mexico that's where we next to go
Do him like his momma make him eat his vegetables
Could call me a stage mom, boy you best to blow
Or you can even call me Wanda cause I'm "red' ta go"
You know I'm spoiled Lil' Daddy, stomps the floor
We can do it on Fifth Ave. in the department store
We can do it in Tokyo, we do it in Taiwan
All my Harajuku girls say I am they icon

[Chorus One]

[Chorus Two: Bobby V]
Say we can do it anywhere (cra-zy places)
I wanna freak you anywhere (cra-zyyy)
We can do it anywhere (cra-zy places)
I wanna freak you anywhere (cra-zyyy)

[Gucci Mane]
Don't compare me to your ex-man, baby he a local joker
I'll take you to Six Flags and drill you on the roller coaster
Call your girlfriends over, we can have a sleepover
Buy yo' ass a Jeep so I can fuck you in ya Range Rover
Pictures in the nude, on the cruise, we gon' make the news
Sex great, sex tape, ready fo' a YouTube
Damn it turn me on, when we do it in ya momma home
Father long gone, but Gucci be your daddy baby
I can fly you anywhere, we can sex in crazy places
Airport, train stations, goin up the escalator
At the Dome, on the 50, I'ma throw it, you the center
When you hike it, I'ma spike it, girl don't act like you don't like it

[Chorus One] + [Chorus Two]

[Trina]
How bad you wanna do me on a scale of one to ten?
You like the way I bend, now you askin where I been
If I'm doin him, now you startin that again?
I dont wanna sex yo' friend; he don't got enough to lend
Plus he was doin Lynn and she ain't nuttin like amazin
Her stuff run deep and he don't have a occupation
I'm known across the nation, Trina's that chick
Bow legs, red boned, long hair, real thick
Do me at my momma house? Nah, I don't think so
I got too much class, but you can try San Pedro
I need the biggest mansion, ocean backyard
With the newest Maybach and inside a black card

[Bobby V]
Tonight I'll touch you in yo' favorite spot (oh yeah)
Promise to get ya body so hot (we can do it anywhere)
So baby, don't be scared
If they see us baby I don't care
We can do it in the Gucci sto'
Close down the mall girl you just don't know, in front of the police
In front of yo' daddy; girl it's you and me
And I don't give a damn that's why they call me Bobby V

[Chorus One] + [Chorus Two]

[Outro: Bobby V]
