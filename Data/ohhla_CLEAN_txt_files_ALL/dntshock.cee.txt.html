[Cee-Lo Green]
I believed in magic
Once upon a time
When something had to be special
Couldn't see it online
Was that the business plan?
Well, you lost your, biggest fan
Tell me, what's the point in doing
what anybody can?

[Chorus]
Now all the rock stars are regular people,
and being alive is becoming a bore
'Cause nothing, absolutely nothing, is shocking anymore
Now that reality is a TV show 
I wish you liked me a little more
'Cause nothing, absolutely nothing, is shocking anymore

{*crickets*}

I can't believe it's over (It's over) 
The glory days are gone   (Glory days are gone)
I can't hear my heartbeat (Can't hear my heartbeat)
with the radio on         (With the radio on)
Now he's in love with him
Mmm, and she's sleeping with them
Well hey, I wish you well
'Cause everything's for sell

[Chorus]
Now all the rock stars are regular people,
and being alive is becoming a bore
'Cause nothing, absolutely nothing, is shocking anymore
Now that reality is a TV show
I seen a million times before
'Cause nothing, abso-LUTEly nothing, is shocking anymore

[Interlude]
Hit me wit a little something smooth! 

{saxophone solo}

Alright...
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Khujo Goodie on the saxophone
Play on, brotha..
You know how you get fed up with it sometimes
All you could just say is, "OOOOOOOOOOOH~!!"

{*crickets*}

[Chorus]
Now all the rock stars are regular people,
and being in love is becoming a bore
'Cause nothing, absolutely nothing, is shocking anymore
Ohh, ain't nothing wrong having a J-O-B
But tell me who you're working for
'Cause nothing, absolutely nothing, is shocking anymore</pre>
