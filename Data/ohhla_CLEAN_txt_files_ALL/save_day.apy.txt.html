"It's a day to be long remembered...
A day of hope for peace...and justice throughout the galaxy"

[Verse 1]
Defeating evil foes, Silver Surfin' through the galaxy
Battling wack emcees, (Da da da!) Super Apathy
Traveling at the speed of light, no destination planned
Intergalactic superpowers pulsating through my hand
Switch my focus to my enemy, plotting devestation
[Clear the mind, clear the soul) before engaging confrontation
Place my fist upon my chest to summon superpowers
I tower over everybody, adversaries cower
I turn green, no wait a minute, red...fuck it, I'm blue
With my sidekick, no fuck that too, my superhuman crew
Demigodz, throwing lightning rods of energy on your planet
Crushing granite rock seedings into blocks like sandwiches
Lighting candlesticks with laser rays from my eyes
Speeding faster than a bullet streaking through the skies
All my foes despise the ways of the immortal
Half man and half amazin', traveling through my mystic portal

[Chorus] (2X]
I'm tryin' to tell these evildoers, crime don't pay
Do your thing, I'll do mine kid, stay outta my way
I gotta make the planet safer for our children to play
So your hero's on his way..."Here I come to save the day"
