[Intro/Hook 2X]
Thiiiiiiiiiings... - Things ain't what they used to be

[Verse One]
Emergency, ambulance patrollin my storm
The ground's bloddy, bodies blasted, bastards {?} fall
Lost and found...confusion...
A murder mystery fusion; for me to R&amp;B/behave that's an illusion
I need not no white man's hand
to give 'em the five on the black hand's side
'Cause that's that bull jive, I've thrive to survive
since nine-seven-seventy-five
My date of birth when my Timbs first touched the EARTH...
Now there's a hood headed for riches
Later for these blind swine witches
Cornball cops is throwin curves all pitches
Man hunt, for big mouth snitch
Who sold out for three crack rock, teeth start to twitch
as he points the finger for 5-0 and thens ta pull the trigger QUICKA...(quicka...)
..Please! Things ain't what they used to be!

[Chorus: Justine Simmons]
Mercy, mercy meeeee-heeeeeeee...
I said things ain't what they used to be, no..no-oh....

[Hook 4X]

[Verse Two]
What's resurrected with the old school ways?
They got the microphone grip in times to save todays
Bullets through bodies while it sees it seems
around the block the fiends be catchin wreck for greens
Daily battles on the hot playgrounds
and hear the sound, "buck BUCK" and then the rain comes down
True blues on my tube, I'm lookin and my hip-hop's dead
'cause all these wannabes a bred
Whatever happened to the real "Summer Madness?"
Run-D.M.C., wit "My Adidas" was the baddest!
The bomb step, with the Kangol hats
Gold chains around the necks of crew who made the name
Funny, that people crave for the rug {?}
Jump around BUCKTOWN, there the {?} it's at
I know the world's +Doggy Dogg+, but stop +Snoopin'+, G
..cause things ain't what they used to be

[Chorus and hook]

[Justine Simmons]
I can't take the memories, of once upon a time
It only gets the best of me, and it's always on my mind
Just show them how to love and/or teach 'em to be kind
The children are our future, they always on my miiiiiiiiiiind-dah!

I said mercy, mercy meeeee-heeeeeeee...
I said things ain't what they used to be, no..no-oh....
Mercy, mercy meeeee-heeeeeeee...
I said things ain't what they used to be, no..no-oh....
