For those that used to sit in the back of the classroom
and never say shit when a teacher would ask a question
They knew the answer, but they didn't wanna draw attention to themselves
cos they were fucked up on these insecurities and shit
...it's time to fuck em' off

[Chorus]
And I'm not gonna be quiet anymore
I'm gonna raise my voice and make some noise
I'm not gonna be a pawn anymore
I'm just gonna make some noise

[Verse 1]
Well my teachers never knew me, I was an invisible man
Now I've got one groupie and about three fans
And I found that shell and sabotaged my plans
Buried my nose and dug with my hands
Dirt loads of corroded scams that tanned my conscience
And burnt my roster, corf(cork)board and helicopter models
I was a backdrop that had lots of morals
But cash crops had to stop off at the Bottle O
I was the keep low, stay quiet, quite soft, not into violence
But come crunchtime
I'll throw a punch with a tight fist that might miss
But still try to commit to the untimely swing
They could sing I could whinge, rinse off the outer layer
I was a dried up tell me later
With a favour to pay and it took a pissed off attitude to play
Though I stay calm, I no longer see the harm and I slay farms
That breed the hold me back and you can take a hold of that

[Chorus] {2X}

[Verse 2]
And If I wasn't such a doormat, I'd probably be a mallrat
Chewin tobbacco and sportin a straw hat
Tryin to format the floor scraps that sat spread on the bed of my mind
Binded with puzzle pieces and subtle speeches
Made by the men in grey suits, with blurred faces and a debut
Sticker sayin stay true on their forheads, bigger picture force fed
Through the gaps in my teeth, one more star to reach
Now carve this beef and chew the gristle, and if you blow the whistle
The darkness will feast on ya simple little plan to please the middle man
In a pickle jam, rolling around in a substance
Tryin to find the right way to say FUCK THIS
Nah better yet get ahead of the buskers, who make noise with more comfort
Sucked into a closed mouth, an open house sold with no inspection
Give me a minutes digestion, never a question raised
But now I'ma make some noise with the words I say
and you can play with the fuckin terds I lay

[Chorus] {2X}</pre>
