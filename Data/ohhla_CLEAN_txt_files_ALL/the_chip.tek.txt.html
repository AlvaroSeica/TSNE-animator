Hi (Hi) Tek (Tek) Zilla.. Zilla.. Zilla..
We up on this one baby
Hi-Teknology Volume 2: The Chip, ha ha
Uhh

Damn, who could it be, Hi-Tek-Zilla
They ain't heard the 'Natti in the while
Had to keep my ear to the ground
For the peeps who be lovin beats by the pound
Came up in the game, niggaz stayed the same
Nigga how you hate on that shit (hate on that shit)
Singlehandedly carried the 'Natti on my back
And I ain't even that big
Little nigga got it done
I ain't even talk about bustin no gun
This is for the streets (uhh) for the cars
For the niggaz who be countin them ones
I done had a lot of fun
Been across the world about damn near twice
Only thing I can tell you, is when you spit
Bring the truth to the light
Fist to the fight, lyrics to the mic
Whole lot of wind to them pipes
Be prepared to put in hard work
Number one nigga don't get caught up in the hype
I done been through a lot of pain
Tryin to get up in this game damn near my whole life
Be the first one to tell a nigga
If you ain't Twista it don't happen "Overnight"
