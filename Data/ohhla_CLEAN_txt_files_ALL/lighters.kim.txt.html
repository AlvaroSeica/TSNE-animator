[Verse One]
I come from Bed-Stuy
Where niggaz either do or they gone die
Gotta keep the Ratchett close by
Someone murdered
Nobody seen, nobody heard it
Just another funeral service
Niggaz will get at you
Come through shinin', they yap you
In broad daylight kidnap you
Best get clap through
Police stay on us like tattoos
Niggaz only grind cuz' we have to
Money is power
Sling crack, weed, and powder
Fiends come through every hour
Its all about that dollar
And we no deal with cowards
Weak lamb get devoured
By the lion in the concrete jungle, the strong stand and rumble
The weak fold and crumble
Its the land of trouble
Brooklyn home of the greatest rappers
BIG comes first then the queen comes after

[Chorus]
Now put your lighters up (Bed-Stuy)
Put your lighters up (New-York)
Put your lighters up (D.C.)
Keep putting your lighters up (Philedelphia)
Put your lighters up (Detroit)
Put your lighters up (Chi-town)
Keep putting them lighters up
No matter where you from, put your lighters up

[Verse Two]
Now, let me give you a walk through
Show you what to do and you dont do
Where its not safe to go to
Them boys approach you
Better say quick who you close to
Dont come through if niggaz dont know you
Cuz' people is talking
The streets is watching
The G's is lurking
Stash the nine in the garbage
The life of a hustla
The life of a gambler
Dice game, kill more niggaz than cancer
You know who you fuck with
Brooklyn dont run, we run shit
Roll up and just bumrush shit
We dont play that
Out in Bk, not at all, For a pound leave your face on the wall
R.I.P in memory of, Never show thy enemies love
We get it on where we live
You better have a pass, when you cross that bridge
Welcome to Brooklyn

[Chorus]
Put your lighters up (L.A.)
Put your lighters up (V.A.)
Put your lighters up (Texas)
Keep putting your lighters up (New Orleans)
Put your lighters up (St.louis)
Put your lighters up (A-T-L)
Keep putting them lighters up
No matter where you from, Put your lighters up

[Bridge]
Damn homie I'm so tore
And I dont think I'm ever gone somke no more
And I dont think I'm ever gone drink no more
But fuck it bartender you can give me one more
(We in the club like) Damn homie I'm so tore
(Lighting the dutch like) And I dont think I'm ever gone somke no more
(Passing the bub like) And I dont think I'm ever gone smoke no more
(Back at the bar like) Fuck it bartender you can give me one more

[Verse Three]
See, BIG done told you
Im the hottest bitch on the planet
Biggest sex symbol, since Janet
Theres a Nolte bandit
Laying in the cut like a bandage
Come through Fulton St. in the vanquish
Doing them damage
And if you dont understand it
Then let me give it to you in spanish
Soy la senorita mas Linda del barrios y lo es abo tu eres despacio
Still over in Brazil, Sipping Mescotto
You must of forgot though
So Imma' take you back to the block yo
Put you on to how we rock yo
Some are boosting
12-year olds prostituting
Hit-men hired for execution, Theres no solution
Niggaz still piss in the hallways
Fiends get high on em' all day
The youth them bang at the cops off the roof
If you dont know my town is the truth
Welcome to Brooklyn

[Chorus]
Now put your lighters up (New Jersey)
Put your lighters up (Boston)
Put your lighters up (B-More)
Keep putting your lighters up (Miami)
Put your lighters up (Puerto Rico)
Put your lighters up (Kingston, Jamaica)
Keep putting them lighters up
No matter where you from, Put your lighters up
