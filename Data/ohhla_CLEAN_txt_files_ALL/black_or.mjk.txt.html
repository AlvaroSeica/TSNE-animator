Eat this!"

Aaow!
Aaow!

I took my baby on a Saturday bang
Boy, is that girl with you? Yes, we're one and the same
Now I believe in miracles
And a miracle has happened tonight

Hee!

But, if you're thinkin' about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white

Ooh

They print my message in the Saturday Sun
I had to tell them, I ain't second to none
And it's all about equality and it's true,
Either you're wrong or you're right

Ooh

But, if you're thinkin' about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
Alright

Ooh, ooh
It's black, it's white
It's tough for you to get by
It's black, it's white, whoo
Ooh, ooh
It's black, it's white
It's tough for you to get by
It's black, it's white, whoo

I am tired of this devil
I am tired of this stuff
I am tired of this business
Sew when the going gets rough
I ain't scared of your brother
I ain't scared of no sheets
I ain't scared of nobody
Girl, when the goin' gets mean

(L. T. B.)
Protection, for gangs, clubs and nations
Causing grief in human relations
It's a turf war on a global scale
I'd rather hear both sides of the tale
See, it's not about races, just places, faces
Where your blood comes from is where your space is
I've seen the light get duller
I'm not going to spend my life being a color

Don't tell me you agree with me
When I saw you kicking dirt in my eye

But, if
You're thinkin' about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white

I said if
You're thinkin' of being my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white

I said if
You're thinkin' of being my brother
It don't matter if you're black or white

Ooh, ooh
Yeah, yeah, yeah now
Ooh, ooh
Yeah, yeah, yeah now

It's black, it's white
It's tough for you
To get by
It's black, it's white, whoo

It's black, it's white
It's tough for you
To get by
It's black, it's white, whoo</pre>
