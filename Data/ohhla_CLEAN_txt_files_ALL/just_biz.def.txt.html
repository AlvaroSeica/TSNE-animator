What up Kamal? (word up) Doing my thing
What you think about the def dumb and blind in the 9-6?
(Word brothers is blind to the fact son.) Can't see,
can't hear, can't think. A-yo El let me lace this.

Verse 1:
5 hours a night sleep is what I get
No time to sleep I gotta make moves kid
So I hustle after work during work or on the road
A man can't achive if he don't have goals
And that's real that's word to mi abuala
I tell ya when I was young she said "Son no time for failures"
So now I keep pressing give thanks for all my blessings
I'm my own worst critic cause it's important to keep testing
My skills for future development I progress never regress
Never let stress get the best of me
This shit ain't easy being a MC
I don't wrap no gifts I represent the hip hop industry
I come to evaluateyour mind with the heavy weight
Rhymes support the black and fight these devils with the sublimes
Conscious righteousness theres no way you can fight this
Rhythm your moving your head because you like this
Now can I get a witness? Societys choas no time to floss
Just business

Hook:
Caught up in the choas no time to floss just business business
"Definatly handle it" (x4)

Verse 2:
Wheather your a corporate exec or drive an 18 wheeler
People in the 90's attitude is gettin' iller
I feel the sign of times is no shorts mad heads are hungary
And if you floss you'll get caught 
Out there you're scarred apon that ass like tupperwear
Run all your goods be thankful you're still alive
Brothers don't jive on the street when it comes to me
Near a stop light look to your window run your Benz
You say "What else can happen to me it's a bad day black?"
Walk into your house and enter a hijack
Skimask in your face run the combination to your safe quickly
Feel the nine poke your kidney
Your in the Twilight Zone of come up
Where shadey people run up and tell you "Shut the fuck up"
They lock yp on the count that you luck out 
They snatch your gems plus you lost your Benz 
And your chrome rims
You was floss now you just lost in the cycle
You become your own worst enemy your suicidal

Hook

Verse 3:
I knew this girl named Shiela, she was a part time yo deala
She rocked mad equiped Adida sometimes Fila
Sometimes Dona Kerrin' 
She always made sure that I knew what she was wearin'
Shiela had a problem but simply didn't know
That the fact of the matter was she was too conversational
She gossiped too much talked about this and that
Even told strangers the source of her cash stacks
So one day Shiela met this kid named Jay
Said he needed two keys by the end of the day
So she arranged it for this strange kid
Hooked him up with the source sappose 
The baddest statue of being the boss, ? Shiela and Jay sit down
commence to get down to buz while the one time surrounds
Boss puts the yay up on the bar
Shiela sees Jay green bag starts thinkin' she's a superstar
One time kicks the door in 
Shiela starts runnin' frantic, lead fills her back kid
Now you tell me what was Shiela thinking
Caught up in this choas with her eyes blinkin'
