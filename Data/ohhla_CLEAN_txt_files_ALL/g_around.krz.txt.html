Kali baby!

[Verse 1: Krizz Kaliko]
Gave me gave me, you not offer baby, shame on you
Now I'm naming you with gangs of babes I gave it to
Now it's front of you, I know you know I want it too
We stay cuckoo cause I get around

[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]
(I get around)
Just let me do what I do
(Don't hold me down, down, down)
I wouldn't do it to you
(It's alright)
If you wanna act like a hoe
(For one night)
As long as you know

(That I get around)
Way-oh, way-oooh
(That I get around)
Way-oh, way-oooh
(That I get around)
Way-oh, way-oooh

[Verse 2: Krizz Kaliko]
'Scuse me, what you want from me?
Sme shoe, what they want from you?
Whatever happened to the groupies?
Who wanna meet me just to do me
We ain't gotta get off crazy
I ain't called ya, now ya hate me

[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]
(I get around)
Just let me do what I do
(Don't hold me down, down, down)
I wouldn't do it to you
(It's alright)
If you wanna act like a hoe
(For one night)
As long as you know

(That I get around)
Way-oh, way-oooh
(That I get around)
Way-oh, way-oooh
(That I get around)
Way-oh, way-oooh

[Verse 3: Krizz Kaliko)
'Scuse me, what you want from me?
Sme shoe, what they want from you?
Cause I get around like doughnut, don't I?
Boner, bigga boota (yeah!)
Said anything to make them come out they living
It's Kali, a magnum for the women
You gave it up cause you was not at my show
I'm going just till they letting me go
Talking with fans, they like Kali sound
But don't falling of with me, baby!

[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]
(I get around)
Just let me do what I do
(Don't hold me down, down, down)
I wouldn't do it to you
(It's alright)
If you wanna act like a hoe
(For one night)
As long as you know

(That I get around)
Way-oh, way-oooh
(That I get around)
Way-oh, way-oooh
(That I get around)
Way-oh, way-oooh

[Verse 4: Tech N9ne]
I'm an amazing
Living a making
And no vickie completely I'm taken
Into the muttin but I'm leaving her something
Got her something, but I'm leaving you money
For the wanton
Many moves I get it
Any poon I wet it quit
Can't let it sit, I ain't got no etiquette
Women are fetishists, eat em up like lettice
And feder, chedder and then my vendetta

[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]
(I get around)
Just let me do what I do
(Don't hold me down, down, down)
I wouldn't do it to you
(It's alright)
If you wanna act like a hoe
(For one night)
As long as you know

(That I get around)
Way-oh, way-oooh
(That I get around)
Way-oh, way-oooh
(That I get around)
Way-oh, way-oooh</pre>
