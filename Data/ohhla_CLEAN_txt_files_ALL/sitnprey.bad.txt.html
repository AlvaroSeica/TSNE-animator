Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
Sometimes I just sit and prey
Sometimes I just sit and prey
Said I don't know, why do I live my life this way?
Why do I live my life this way?
Yo, said that apex rise on the empire's eyes
Can't testify I'm the best to fly
Live your life, and I'm gonna live mine!

Tell me what a fuck an angel does
We're seeing kids who ain't aged enough
Getting high off angel dust
From NY to Los Angeles there ain't no love!
In the heart of the city looking where they caught at
And they party at, you party at, you're rescuing for your risky
Real I change teams for real pussy
Cash used to honor this rap
Now looking, should they been the same?
Just a nigga started booking them
Pull up with your pin up, looking sharper than the bullet
And what pen stripes and I look at bullet and
He's something that you invest in
Got him live on late night, but he ain't interesting
Pop up poop out, something like contestant
No corrections, cause the mic been checked in!
The only time he be asking when he section
My team live, teen ageis an X man
Fine spark when I step in, heat the human torch
Inhaling, fuels are for all sorts of cause
Steve told me how to store it in my
We stop by the day, we'll never get caught
I say it again, we say but never loss
Either be a for six feet short.
Each day in this living hell, feel remorse
We had a million dollars smell way before it flaws

[Chorus]
Sometimes I just sit and prey
Sometimes I just sit and prey
Said I don't know, why do I live my life this way?
Why do I live my life this way?
Cause that apex rise on the empire's eyes
Can't testify I'm the best to fly
Live your life, and I'm gonna live mine!

Yo, I'll try the Oprah and win-win with a in my hand
The morning passed off like a generous man
And they wonder what it cost to put the pen in my hand
But don't understand they're the only one who gets the benefit
Sometimes I just sit and pray
We could have walked this way in my Gs
It wouldn't feel despair, but 
Like their souls disappear,
Sing our heart froze, you drop like this
Couldn't close my ghost souls, eyes closed
Covered Ray Banns, I call it my eyes closed, and I know!
Even through shades of black
I see brighter days looking back and facts
So I relax my mind, see what these can find
The gold mine that will make me rich in both times and mine
Gotta make it all mine if you don't mind

[Chorus]
Cause sometimes I just sit and play
Sometimes I just sit and play
Sometimes I just sit and play
They're like sit and play
They're like sit and play
Cause that apex rise on the empire's eyes
Can't testify I'm the best to fly
Live your life right
And I'm gonna live mine!

Right on the block when they sit and play
Lives the vicious ways where they spit and spray
Vicious trades coming from that ice you kept it yesterday
It's nothing but the history, protect the young from being history
And the next day, your face is just a mystery
For niggas who really ain't feeling me, all my fucking enemies.
Even the lightest hour requires heavy artillery
Accelerate without the breaks of a break
And still I'm not eating up a lot when it's a lot on my plate
All in the days, work the God and his grace
You wanna eat and tell God to say grace
And avoid He getting the
It's a soft nigga, caught between these rocks and a hard place
Because the Mafia is on the look out for the Scarface
But the ill minded child, is ill minded child
Got around this towns, killing niggas right around the
Very well round roundy
Well till the highest number praying that 2047  number

[Chorus]
Sometimes I just sit and prey
Sometimes I just sit and prey
Said I don't know, why do I live my life this way?
Why do I live my life this way?
Cause that apex rise on the empire's eyes
Can't testify I'm the best to fly
Live your life, and I'm gonna live mine!</pre>
