[Promoe]
I'm all city like graffiti, better yet all country
'bout to go all planet if it goes the way I planned it
Fanatic fan addict but a man at it
Loop Troop's a sickness now we're lettin' Japan have it
Givin' a bad habit no matter who distributes
no matter what record label I gotta spit the truth
The illest troop you can't keep a good sound down
in Tokyo my sh*t is heard around town
I'm screamin' on emcees: unless you drop gems please
shut the f*ck up, hand over your benz' keys
The way I see things in Europe, nobody's f*ckin' with this
and in the states, well I don't really wanna dis
But some rappers take hip hop for granted
watch me run up in their spot like moe and mike mecanic
Panic! When my rhymes cross the atlantic
then cross the pacific if it goes the way I planned it
Fanatic fan addict but a man at it
Loop Troop's a sickness now we lettin' Japan have it!

[Chorus]
You diggin' me man: Looptroop big in Japan
kick the real sh*t and get 3 million fans
World supremacy/ p-r-o-m-o-e
I said you diggin' me man Loop Troop is big in Japan
spit that rah rah sh*t and get 6 million fans
World supremacy/ s-u-p-r-e-m-e

[Supreme]
Hell yeah this be Supreme from the Loop Troop singers
known for hit singles and stiff middle fingers
Just ring us, then bring us for the time of your life
we'll forever be a part of your life cus of your two timing wife
Tout le monde we world wide
your fan base is your man's place they thought your tape was aight
Since you ain't nothing in the streets you pose to be a club thug
all hyped up but never really done sh*t like that millennium bug
Cos of the drugs, sex and alcohol
I'm in this to rip the clubs, decks and microphones
In Tokyo and former Russia
informers rush the set cus of we hollerin' anarchy like Busta
And cuss the downpressor men from the top of my lungs
till they start makin' sense and be dropppin' their guns
Once my crew gets to speak out they freak out
this ain't supposed to leak out we ain't supposed to sneak out
The back door with black dough, Loop Troop is like WHOA
conquerin' the world in two triple O's
so: do panic, that bull sh*t can it
my crew's a sickness and now we letting Japan have it

[Chorus]
You diggin' me man Loop Troop is big in Japan
teach the youths the truth and get 10 million fans
World supremacy/ Cos to the m-i-c

[Cosmic]
It's the DVSG entreprenuers
cruisin' thru the underground systems to the Japanese sewers
Nobody boo us they more like: sayonara
glad you came, it's the bomb! aight peace we feel honored
We stand as one build as one swarm
and travel to the other side of the planet to perform
I look to the east (why?) yo do I even have to mention it
this western world got us trapped in censorship
Cus everything that I say is political
and everything that I write makes me a suspected criminal
Subliminal adertising behind enemy lines
you'll find the message between the lines when you rewind
dlrow eht reuqnoc srekcoR poortpooL
lriws ot eunitnoc lliw srekcoR poortpooL
starting point right here we just landed
Loop Troop's the illest virus now we're lettin' Japan have it

[Chorus]
Diggin' me man: Looptroop big in Japan
building a plan to get millions of fans
Blao blao bo bo bo/ Supreme, Cosmic, Embee and Promoe
Du ligger i lä Looptroop sticker iväg
över till Japan är jiggy där mä'</pre>
