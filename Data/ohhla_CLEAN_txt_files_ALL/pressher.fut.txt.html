[Verse 1] (Future)
I took her to the back and told the Dj bring it back
the Dj wasnt budging so I had to press a button
its stuck and now I'm popping every part of her exterior
I'm pressing like a pad on her pussy during periods
I'm curious to find out what a girl like you can do

I got her on the phone cuz I know its going down
she wan me press her button so I dial

[Chorus]
She wan me press her button, like the keys dem pon di keyboard
thats what we do whenever we bored, she wan me press her button

Press it, press it, never left it left it

[Verse 3] (Destiny)
Futures in the back, kimiks in the middle
I know you wanna follow, I can see it in your nipples
you said you like ballers, well baby I can dribble
so am I getting heads or tales, flip the nickle
my lingo is official like certified pistols
now I'm all in your mouth like toothbrush bristles
baby its simple, me push a button
got you yelling to your sisters and your cousins

[Chorus]
She wan me press her button, like the keys dem pon di keyboard
thats what we do whenever we bored, she wan me press her button
cuz me no dul; like Eor, stab it hard like me have three sword
ME press it like, doo, doo, doo, doo,doo, doo, doo, doo,doo, doo, doo
