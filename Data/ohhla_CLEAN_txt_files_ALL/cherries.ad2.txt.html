Album:  What More Can I Say?
Song:   I Like Cherries
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

Yo man, I love me some apples
        Get out of here, pears are the move
Pears?  Peaches are the move
        Peaches?  I like bananas ("Brooklyn style")
Bananas??
                [Chorus]
*singing* I like cherries cause cherries taste better
          and grapes are sour, AHH, I'll ask for more
          AHH, I'll ask for more
          I like cherries cause cherries taste better
          and grapes are sour

*cutting and scratching* "Bust a move"

        Yo Milk... what kind of fruit, do you like?
I don't like bananas, I don't like peaches
I don't like fruit I bite and it screeches

                [Chorus]

If a lime's to a lemon and a lemon's to a lime
Why do cherries taste better, all the time?
        I don't know about that but you just shouldn't miss
        Just sit back relax and yo, bust this

        A philosopher once said
        that "life is a bowl of cherries"

*singing* AHH, I'll ask for more
          AHH, I'll ask for more

                [Chorus - last two lines]

*cutting and scratching* "From the Audio Two"
                         "Milk D, from the Audio Two"
                         "From the Audio Two"
                         "Gizmo, Gizmo"
                         "Go for yours" (3X)
                         "Go for yours while I go for mine"

        Yo Milk, what kind of pie do you like?
I don't like those that's old and stale
With burnt up crust and fruit that's pale

                [Chorus]

*cutting and scratching* "Brooklyn style"

Yo Gizmo man, what kind of GIRLS do you like?
        I like the girls that pass the test
        And I like those girls that are so...... 

                [Chorus]</pre>
