[Intro]
Take me from insanity
Take me from humanity uhh
Take me from insanity
Take, me, from..

[Hodgy Beats]
I'm goin insane, everything has changed
No longer the same, no longer to blame
No longer the shame, forever the pain
Forever become never been with you again
Tired of my lies, fed 'em to you like fries
Tellin you bullshit, shoulda left it for the flies
You love me and despise, love me in your eyes
Love me in your thighs when I'm between and inside
Hate to see you cry, you drop like rain
So I stretch out the truth leavin you with a sprain
You like a white shirt I'm a bright red stain
Blood from a broken heart shoot down in cold pain
Too much of a player 'fore I stepped in the game
My deal is to play my best and entertain
You try to make your body erase me, erase me
But your mind and heart constantly debates me

[Chorus]
So what happens when you can't let go?
(Uh-huh... what happens when you can't get away?)
So what happens when you can't let go? {*2X*}
(Uh-huh... what happens when you can't get away?)
So what happens when you can't let go? {*6X*}
(What happens when you can't get away?)
So what happens when you can't let go?

[Hodgy Beats]
I'm like a house made out of bricks, no stones, no sticks
Signin for this shit, my toilets need to be fixed
I carry no character like my mind's on hold
I need a new roof and my blinds are closed
Eyes closed, blindfold; when can I see again?
Books burnt to the letter that I can't read again
My stove from the '60s, how can I ever feed again
No best friends false bringin in, breathig in
A tile in the floor cracked that they stepped on
Laid covers cuddled up and slept on
A house ain't a home between a bond, they left one
So they abandon me, split apart and kept goin
As far as they could to get away
Heal the memories of loved ones stay
I'm not up for sale, I'm a priceless possession
Left behind and forgotten, I hold no aggression

[Chorus]</pre>
