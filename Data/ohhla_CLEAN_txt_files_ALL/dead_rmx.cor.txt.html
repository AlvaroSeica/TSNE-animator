[Cormega]
as death nears you sink deeper
in his reach as you're caressed by the grim reaper
as my heat enters your flesh, you begin to meet up
with the same streets you claimed was yours they remain yours
your blood stains the floor where the candles were lit
your thugs came to mourn but ain't handling shit
your drugs are now my drugs
I can't front your re-up was a little more than mines was
I didn't kill you, greed did
son, you think I only know niggaz in Queensbridge, i'm a made nigga
an outlaw, you can take it to your grave nigga
eternally known my heat blaze niggaz
stuck me for that Q, should've never bucked it
the eleventh commandment, is never fuck me
you hit me in the chest
lucky I was wearing a vest but the impact hurt my fucking flesh
fucked up my avirex and made my neighbors upset
your own gun created your death
look at you now, a reminder of consequences
in the street, but loyalty is nearly non-existant (that's deep)
you should've seen yo man faces when I came to the wake
had the mac with the compressor, under my black leather
bitches crying niggaz eyeing whispering "that's Mega"
tension in the air I pause
ice grills turned to fear
you don't want it
I let them breathe at the same time yes believe "coming here fronting"
you never leave, as I approach your open casket
I'm in your face like "damn I smoked this bastard"
you was a dead man walking
now you a live nigga laying in the coffin..</pre>
