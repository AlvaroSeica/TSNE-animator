[Intro]
(Woo-weee!) There will be no stoppin (uh-huh)
Cause when you go harder than somebody man (yeahhh)
This right here (uh-huh) is domination

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
This here what you call domination
It's a combination of skill and concentration
So rise to the occasion, do something amazin
Cause anythang that I do, I dominate it

[Verse One]
I'm stronger, go harder, I'm a monster
I conquer, dominate anything I want to
My passion, my skill, my focus, my hunger
Just to put it simple, I'm the {*fucking shit*}
Yes I, just want it mo' than the next guy
And no you, can't do the things that I'm gon' do
Real aggressive, lil' rough around the edges
A man on a mission smashin the competition
Who my next victim? Get 'em, I got 'em (woo)
Let me know if anybody else got a problem
Yeah, cause they don't even stand a chance
Got the, eye of the tiger, and the, heart of a champ
I just want it more yeah man I need to win it
Pedal to the floor, we gon' push it to the limit
Yeah man, they wishin' but they can't {*fuck*} with me though
Even when it gets all quiet, I'm still on beast mode (woo!)

[Chorus]

[Verse Two]
See messin with the boy, you will quickly be destroyed
So just, stay out my way as somethin you should avoid
I think it's time to show the world what I got
Yeah, I think it's time I turned it up a notch
Man, I figured it out, why they mad at us
Cause I'm in my zone, oh yeah, I got my swagger up
I put a hurtin on anyone who test me
Close my eyes, take a deep breath, okay I'm ready
Yeah, yeah, I'm ready, yeah I'm ready to go
I'm the boss, I'm the leader, I'm the man in control
See I make my own rules, baby I don't lose
Trust me, {*fuck*} around with me it get ugly
Bring it down low, let me talk to you quietly
If I want you, I'ma get you, there;s no way for you to hide from me
Towerin, overpowerin, anybody
To put it simple homey there's no way that you can stop me!

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
It's how I operate, I dominate, knock 'em down like dominoes
Let's conversate, concentrate, I'ma tell you all I know
Go hard, everyday, that's the way you gotta go
When they ask me if I'm gon' stop, I say hell naw!
Never stop, never quit, I'm only gettin better {*bitch*}
I was good before but I'm better than I ever been
Yeah, see, you dealin with a warrior
The fire in me burin like the sun down in Florida
Tell me if you want it I'ma show ya what's in store for ya
And let me if you want more, cause I got more for ya
Ugghchk, so rugged and raw
I live for this, screamin out, gimme some more!
Airtime, we go all out, until it's finished
I dont know why they came, we all know I'm gon' win it
Ain't no time to act timid, I'm the best that ever did it!
{*laughing*} Yeah, I think they know what this is

[Chorus] - 2X

[Outro]
Get it
We work hard...</pre>
