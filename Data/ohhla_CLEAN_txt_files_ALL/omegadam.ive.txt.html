[Verse 1]
The problems have been stacked up too high
And this running trend of apathy paves the way draped over mounds to blame
Soon to be curtains for every man, woman, and child that insist on hovering over
rubble that's left quietly erupting
My television doesn't quite know how to look at me right 
since I said I'd make it my duty to take out its entire race
Fire walk through life with faith with filtered visions out of the picture
now I humbly await the manifestation of eight

[Chorus]
Omega damned, there is no phone ringing
Omega damned, it is all inside my head
Omega damned, there is no phone ringing
Omega damned, I cannot be all that's left

[Verse 2]
The future's bright in the literal sense, cup your hands to catch the yellow ultra
violet gold that's given
With every body racing towards that last piece of haven, tip the scales, cap size
your dumping ground imprisoned
Deafening indeed when bells ring the sound will cover all spires now counductors
sending stadiums up in flames - that's entertainment
When there's nothing left to watch and drool at
vacantly forgotton how to conversate, proceed to chase the sleeping aid

[Chorus]
Omega damned, there is no phone ringing
Omega damned, it is all inside my head
Omega damned, there is no phone ringing
Omega damned, I cannot be all that's left

[Verse 3]
And there will always be tomorrow, we will overcome the obstacles
Rebuild, start from scratch, for this scortched earth is plentiful
Surrender your dead for fossil fuel
Guarantied terrain will be saved, solutions cleary there again
But it's too late, pay the toll - coins on the eye lids for all
Permanent fixtures welded shut, now sit down and behave
For soon a rain will fall unlike any other seen before
Beginning of the end, omega damned all praise

[Chorus]
Omega damned, there is no phone ringing
Omega damned, it is all inside my head
Omega damned, there is no phone ringing
Omega damned, I cannot be all that's left

There is no phone ringing
It is all inside my head
There is no phone ringing
I cannot be all that's left

*Ringing sound*

[Man Screaming]
There is no phone phone ringing damn it!
