[All]      Uh, uh, uh, uh
           Like her booty got hydraulics

[Verse 1: Mr. Capone-E]
She sounded like homey wanna take her home
All eyes on her, check out her iPhone
Shots of Patron, dancin' to the beat, baby
She dancin' three wheel motion, got them boys crazy
From the wreckin' crew, strippin' to the body hop
She likes the candy floss, showin' it off like a rag top
Hips hop with a big booty bumper
She standing out from the rest, the number one stunner
In every party she goes, she gots the fan's hair crazy
She boostin' my game up, so you know I tell 'em my baby
B-b-baby dance slow, pop it up, show ya thang
Let it go, make ya do it, baby still a G thang

Hook 1: All
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Like her booty got hydraulics
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Like her booty got hydraulics
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Like her booty got hydraulics
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Like her booty got hydraulics

[Verse 2: Baby Bash]
She up and down like a six deuce rag top
She only fucks with them boys with the fat gwhop
She make her back drop, she make her back pop
You don't believe me, check her out on your laptop
Outfit, lookin' like it's been painted on
On stage, I'll run a pogey, straight paper on
She blowin' bad, bitches, so they get hated on
They V.I.P. every where cause the paper's long
It's crazy, she can hit a switch and make it beat still
And I ain't never seen a booty do a three wheel
She in them booty hops
It's no contest
When she {*booty hop*} in-in-in the bomb dress

[Mr. Capone-E]
Booty hop in a bomb dress
She booty hops in a bomb dress
She's got a bomb dress
Oh yes, oh yes
Uh
She got a bomb dress

[Baby Bash]
Like her booty got hydraulics
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Like her booty got hydraulics
Uh, uh, uh, uh

[Verse 3: Mann]
Bounce like hydraulics, party like we in college
Money, you know I got it, once the Mann be about profit
My outfit, the freshest, haters, hit the exit
Be the emcee G-stakes screaming out that west, bitch
Everydays, I be that, get the cake, spread out the message
No diamond VVS's, just the gold hair and Rol' necklace
And a bad bitch
Biggity bounce in that ass quick
For this cash and you know I get, old than a average
Livin' lavish
Shaded up in the vent (In the vent...)
Me and my niggas, and we rollin' up a zip
Quick fast, on your bitch ass
I'm the Mann with his hands all on your bitch ass, like
S-SWACK
