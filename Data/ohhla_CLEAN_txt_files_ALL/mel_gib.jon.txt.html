Typed by: AZ Lyrics

My heart is on fire like a burning cross
Compared to you, others are at the back of the bus
You're as beautiful as a swastika
And baby, I want to tell ya

I love you as much as I hate other races
religions and sexual orientations
I love you as much as I love Jesus Christ
Who was brutally murdered by money-loving kikes

I love you
That's why I punched you in the face

I have something to ask, as I get down on one knee
Will you blame yourself if you get raped
You slutty pig in heat
Uh, sorry, that came out wrong
I meant will you be my wife
I wanna be with you for the rest of my
extremely racist and homophobic life

Because
I love you as much as I hate other races
religions and sexual orientations
I love you as much as I love Jesus Christ
Who was brutally murdered by money-loving kikes

I love you
That's why I kicked you in the face

A pack of niggers couldn't keep me from you
I love you as much as I hate fags and jews
Together forever like hate and the human heart
Together forever like hate and the human heart</pre>
