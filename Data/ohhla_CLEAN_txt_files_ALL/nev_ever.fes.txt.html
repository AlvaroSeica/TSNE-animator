[Intro: Fes Taylor]
You ain't gone never make it, Fuck you 2 Fly
That's what they say right, Nah
You aint gone never be shit, Never nigga
That's what the haters think huh?

[Fes Taylor]
The passion in the rhymes that I wrote
Like everything I spoke, I aint never been a joke
I aint saying that I never been broke
But you ever been broke to the point you'll slit a nigga throat
Still asking what's the combination, Sitting while he choked
Already planning on distributing his coke
Scare him up, Even visited his folks
You know, Hammer on the coffee table living room approach
I aint saying that I never ran
If a nigga had the drop on me I aint have mines on me, Damn
Some niggas say fuck it nigga take it like a man
But the only reason I'm racist so I can get the plan
I got a plan nigga, Fuck a hundred grand
We can make a couple million from Uncle Sam nigga
Tell your man pitch up and buy some land witcha
Hoes want sandwiches, You trick'n like an amateur
That aint pimp'n, I aint saying I aint been in love
But some niggas do it just because, And ruin it for us
Niggas looking for a good bitch to settle down with more then a fuck
But still I fuck more then enough
And can't explain to my girl when she calling and I aint picking up
She like think of us, I'm thinking of lust
Same time thinking trust, I think I'm gone bust
I aint saying that I never cried, So many niggas died
So if I lie on they name then may my soul fry
You know why it goes, Flex, Side show, Sick Nick, Grandpa
I was sick like a dope fiend dick
I aint saying that my father wasn't there
Cause I looked up to him, Like a barber in a chair
So my son me and his bond, Little man I love you nigga
I can vision him in Harvard somewhere
I aint saying that my family fucked up
My Moms kept a good job, Son just went bad
More like my Uncle with a hood craft, Scars and scabs
Cars we crash, They aint even ours and laugh nigga
Hope the odds are past us, Jars of grass
And show respect like when a mobster pass nigga
Never been a sucker, A punk motherfucker with no morals
And hoes won't fuck em with no orals
It's only one me with no plural.

[Outro: Fes Taylor]
One me nigga, One nigga, No plural, No plural
Yeah, Okay, Holla at the motherfucking wolves you dig
Wolf Pack, Two-Forty Warriors up in this bitch
Two Four War, Yeah, It's the T-2 Fly album right here
Urban Icons nigga, Yeah, G-Unit/Dum Out nigga
Yeah, Holla at the motherfucking wolves
Never Ever, Uh huh</pre>
