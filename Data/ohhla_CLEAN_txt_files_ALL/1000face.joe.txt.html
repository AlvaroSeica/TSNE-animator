[Intro - Joe Budden - talking] (*echo*)
Uh, a thug changes
Best friends become strangers

[Verse 1 - Joe Budden]
Yo, now we was once two niggaz of the same kind
Went to holla at a hoochie with the same line
Sort of, honestly I'd never guessed you were a hoarder
And if that would manifest all 'cause of what we both thought of her (dog)
So I'm like "how could you get mad at what she thought of me?"
I found out seasons dont only change quarterly
'Cause you got bitter, it was real fickle
With me sayin girls are a dime a dozen, knew a nigga with a nickel
I guess nobody told him that gossip and slander's not the answer (nah)
Wish Id a known that you would flip out over propaganda
Ice in my veins, some people are less skilled (what else?)
And he brought me up on charges when his ego got killed (talk to 'em)
When my friends in doubt, they learn a valuable lesson 'bout
In thirty years I aint reckoned how to reconcile
What hurts more? The act of gettin cut off
Or realizin that your two cents wasnt worth more (dog)

[Chorus - Sample from "A Thousand Faces" by Creed] - w/ Joe Budden ad libs
Now I'm forced to look behind
I'm forced to look at you
You wear a thousand faces
Tell me, tell which is you
Broken mirrors paint the floor
Why can't you see the truth?
You wear a thousand faces
Tell me, tell me which is you

[Verse 2 - Joe Budden]
Check it, nothin could help somebody switch up more than thirst can
I've seen the ill effects that fame could have first hand
Am I to blame for the person that you became?
When youre already on that path, it's so hard for me to explain
Look, some indicators that I'm watchin, who I never met
I see some things happenin now that you would never let
If you were in your right mind
Were you showin me the right person at the right time
Or, were you tryin to make it easy? Did it really please you to please me?
Did that make you change everythin about you to appease me?
My pride in shambles, wonderin why or when did you decide to gamble
Or are you competin with Maia Campbell?
When did that become suitable?
How could you make somethin so ugly out of what was once beautiful?
Next time beautys headed towards me, I plan to dodge (until)
Until I see it's not just bein used as a camouflage (oh!)

[Chorus] - w/ Joe Budden ad libs

[Verse 3 - Joe Budden]
Check it, only reason I continue to antagonize
Just my way of bringin truth into a pack of lies
Reveals peoples' true colors, moves a bad disguise
Even though it's somethin I predicted, I just act surprised
That way the armor never chinks on me
Drunk mouth, sober tongue, homie drinks on me
That way I'm protected, y'all got no choice but to respect it
Seen too many come and go to be affected, how's it not expected?
I'm hip to what it's bound to be
And them relationships combined, ain't weigh a pound to me
And so the bullshit, make sure it's tasteful when it's done
You can keep your thousand faces but try bein faithful to one

[Chorus] - w/ Joe Budden ad libs

Tell me, tell me, tell me

You wear a thousand faces
Tell me which is you
Tell me which is you</pre>
