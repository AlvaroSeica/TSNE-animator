Typed by: AZ Lyrics

How I ride, why I ride, never really had to try
I, I, I... eeuuhh
Nevermind that, blackjack
Needle to the mainline junk prepared in a head that
Never came up for air
Fallin' apart can't get a grip
Don't give a fuck if I did

Way shit goes
It'll be just fine
Oh, oh, oh
How to rob men blind

Can't do a thing but fold, yeah watch that {*3X*}
Can't do a thing... blackjack

Comin' from that hit me until
Twenty one makes
Your chips mine
Black jack don't trip
You got the bill
Twenty one shots to your grill

Bow down or die every time I slap them thangs
Flat black chains rattlin'
Shawshank the box can't be contained
Man came to pick the lock
Empty the vault and leave no trace
Sleep don't wake

Hit em low and keep rollin' to the beat no breaks
Slow it down then accelerate
To hell its cake
Like sellin' weight
No middle man
Made bitch mistakes
Blackjack

High king, ace, to knees the place put down by G's raisin the stakes

You know what's up
Straight
How the fuck is that?
Blackjack
You know what's up
Straight

But don't forget to watch this
Tongue push bankroll off my lips
Who the hell are you legit
What the fuck you think man shit
Blackjack
(Always keep my)

No need to count the deck, I own it
Drop that lead chin check
To your dome it's on black
Respect me zone or get caught back handed leather strap
Hit ya so hard knocked flat broke by a bloke
Wit dat golden contact glove hold the smoke
Of most high fire bon tap tap
Can't do a thing but fold, yeah watch that

Can't do a thing but fold, yeah watch that {*3X*}
Can't do a thing... blackjack

Don't forget to watch this
Tongue push bankroll off my lips
Who the hell are you legit
What the fuck you think man shit

You know what's up
Straight
How the fuck is that.. blackjack

Blackjack don't trip you got the bill, twenty one shots to your grill</pre>
