Aaah ha ha ha (Check this out!)
Wooh! Check it out (Check this out)
Aaaah yeah (Check this out)
Ya just don't stop, kid ya just don't stop (Check this out)
Yeah ya just don't stop, word up
Aaah yeah!

Chorus (x8):

Check it out y'all (Check it check it out, dun) 

Verse 1: Dray, Books

Check this out, yo, yo
Well check it out it's the incredible, never edible, unforgettable
dweller from the cellar kickin terror cos I'm terrible
See I be schoolin em, foolin em when I'm speakin it
Peepin it cos y'all be keepin it, look how I'm freakin it
I got'cha tinglin, tinglin and minglin
Border way to go, the radio they got my single in
They rockin this, ain't no toppin this when I'm droppin this
style that I can buy cos yo I rhyme like a rhinoceros
My skill is illy, silly when I work it
Quick to flip the lip and rip a nigga out the circuit
So step wit it, can ya get wit it when I'm flexin it
Takin out these quick cos my nigga Books is next on it

I know you're not set, check it, you're wonderin where the heck I've been
Chillin stupid, cos there ain't no dooper who got wrecker than
the Boogie Banger, it could be danger so back, tootz
Cos we're guys but niggas wanna revise they rap books
What up kid? I can sell you rugged with the hip-hoppin
Throw it, like to see me from my nuts until my dick top
What a bummer, it seem to be no MC can get dumber than
Me one other, two niggas from the
sewer, my shit is new without the *?bagnesia?*
Cos G, I be's the man from here to Indonesia
Aah yeah, you heard me, see I'm just another dirty dick
Drastically, casually I puff the erb to get zone like the Senate, so

Chorus

Verse 2: Dray, Books

Here I come so nigga don't be hatchin it, I'm snatchin it, niggas o'dose
when I catch this
Niggas in the dark, I spark at them like I was matches
I set up quicker, kick a verse with no distortion
I suggest MC's proceed with some caution
I hip, tip, grippin tit because there ain't no
way I'm gonna lift when I erupt like a volcano
I'm acid, my crew is massive, you're soft like jello
I'm gettin props, a habit like Abbott &amp; Costello
When I flaunt this, niggas want this, they'll be usin
a squeegee when I'm bitchin cos bitch I'm comin to get your ass

Comin to get'cha it's the D-Bats so nigga think back to the way I bring
this
or brung that, I swung that, now look at the way I'm swingin this
just like my name was Joe DiMaggio
and hell Dray! My 12 guage spit shells like pizaggio
We can get it on and my word is bond and fuck who you be G
Your crew is easy just like Sunday mornin when I'm yawnin so
It's no sense in you losin what you got kid
Cos G I be doin the mic like Mr.T be doin the chopsticks
Ya gets done like no matter where ya from, jack
for fun, I'm nailin rappers like a thumb tack
I'm sort've spliffed so I don't think niggas order it
Plus I'm the type you might not like to leave your daughter with
