[Intro: Young Jeezy]
Yeah, it's been a long muh'fuckin time~!
Drumma, let's go get 'em
Guess who's back? Yeah
Let's GO!

[Chorus: Young Jeezy]
Just like that, niggaz don't know how to act
Bet when them niggaz hear this, they get ta grabbin they strap
Just ask them DJs', dey know, they get to bringin it back
Them niggaz hit up the club, they get to bringin the sack
I say now just like that, bitches don't know what to do
And when we hit up the club, you know them broads comin through
I told her hit up her girl, tell 'em that they can come too
And now that bitch off the chain, I told y'all then what I do
I say now just like that

[Young Jeezy]
Bitches they screamin, I can hear bitches callin
Give a fuck if they like it, tell them niggaz I'm ballin (Yeaaaaaaah)
These niggaz holdin they nuts, as you see I ain't stallin
Swear these niggaz a triiiiiip~! As you see I ain't fallin (Ha-haaaaaah!)
They want me trip on my strings, want me fall on my face
Hit a lick for a hunnid (damn!), and it fell in my safe
Said she no alcoholic, but she drink like a toilet
Told her, "Do me a favor and put yo' mouth on this faucet" 
I know just how she like it, she might think I'm a psychic
Even called me a plumber, she like the way that I pipe it
Niggaz talk like they know me, they must got me mistaken (Ha-haaaaaah!)
Bitch I'm pleadin not guilty, you'll never charge me with fakin (Let's GO!)

[Chorus]

[Young Jeezy]
You see my back on my shit, you can tell I'm swaggin
And you know that I got it, you can tell I ain't braggin
Them Rollies wit big faces, drink Ciroc by the cases
I'm Neo out this biiiiitch~! Feel like I'm stuck in +The Matrix+ (Ha-haaaaaah!)
I'm talkin so much white, you would think I was racist
See I came from the bottom, I'm talkin under the basement (Daaaaamn!)
Threw the roof off this bitch, like we just had a tornado
Desert Eagles they twins, I call 'em Cain &amp; Abel (BOOM!)
Hundred K in my pocket, that shit as thick as the Bible
Superstar in my hood, so that would make me an idol (Yeaaaaaah)
Had a hell of a night, so I'ma say me a prayer
In the lockout I'm ballin, so that would make me a player (Let's GO!)

[Chorus]

[Young Jeezy]
I got 'em bouncin and leanin, I got 'em drinkin and smokin
I told her take off her clothes, (What she say?) That she open (Yeaaaaaaah!)
If you gettin to the money, my nigga, ball like a dog
Them cigarillos so big, them bitches look like they logs (Let's GO!)
I'm the life of the party, bring the party some life
You know I'm dead-ass serious, why? Cause I said it twice
We talkin straight suicide, we takin shots to the head
Must be drinkin amnesia, cause I forgot what I said (Ha-haaaaaaah!)
Stack up so much bread I'ma need me a toaster
My partner ride with his chopper, this nigga think he a soldier
Why I'ma stand in the section when I can stand on the sofa?
So y'all guess what I does, you never say I ain't told ya (Let's GO!)
