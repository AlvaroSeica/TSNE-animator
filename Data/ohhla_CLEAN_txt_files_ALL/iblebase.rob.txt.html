[Verse One: Rob Base]
Party people yes
The B-A-S-E is the best
Well know you know it

Crossin over large
Now that I'm in charge

You went platinum, who give a hell and

Rhyme, wack, adapt to the hand clap
You just fell, into my trap
Now you gotta dance, don't act shy
Cause the beats and the rhymes are fly
Get up, just move it

Let's shake it, don't break it
