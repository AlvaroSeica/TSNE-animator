[Intro: Trinidad James]
Yeah!
This shit sound like 007 with an N64 and shit
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah

[Hook x2]
Gold all in my chain
Gold all in my ring
Gold all in my watch
Don't believe jus' watch
Nigga Nigga Nigga
Don't believe jus' watch

Nigga Nigga Nigga
Don't believe me jus' watch

[Verse: Trinidad James]
This ain't for no fuck nigga
If you a real nigga then fuck wit' me
This one for the hood niggas
The hipster bitches that shop at Lennox
Dark skin, light skin, Asian and white women
Hypebeast we know aboutchea'
Don't buy shoes unless they popular
For the hoes, my Nigga
That's pussy poppin' that Magic City
Got that strong, my Nigga
Then come match that shit wit' me
Smoking mid, my nigga
Then don't pass that shit to me
This one for my niggas
And bitches bout' that money (Cashout!)
Gotta love, Chesire Bridge
Them bad hoes at Onyx
I don't fuck wit' no snitches
So don't tell me who tellin
This one for them colleges
Them bad hoes at Spellman
Shout out to them Freshman
On Instagram straight flexin'
Popped a molly, I'm sweatin' (Woo!)
Popped a molly, I'm sweatin' (Woo!)
Momma always told me, boy count yo' blessings
In God I Trust
So I kept countin' them Franklins
I'm too fly, you know this
Lemme' give yo' ass a checklist
One gold watch
Two gold chains
Six gold rings, its NOTHIN' (God Dayum'!)
OG Jordans
Them high socks
No shirt on, I'm stuntin' (Okay!)
And this song for those fuck niggas
Who hatin' on you this summer (Fuck Em'!)
Talk shit behind your back
But won't say shit in public (Fuck Em'!)
