[love me]

I'm here for you girl for whatever you need
I'll stand by your side
Girl, for you I'll bleed
Nobody else can come between you and me
Only if you love me then forever we'll be
Lost in love, unconditionally
But girl you gotta let me know how much you care
How much you really love me
Cause our love is rare
I'll swim the deepest seas
Take you out and buy you things
Anything for you
Girl I wanna let you know baby I love you
But if you trust in me I'll put my trust in you
And if you love me too then baby what would you do?

OoOoOh what would you do {*3X*}

[love me]
Would you hold me closely
In this time of need would you be there for me
[love me]
Would you remain by my side
Through these rough times and keep your hopes alive
[love me]
I know you're there for me
I'm here for you too baby confide in me
[love me]
Would you faithfully stay by my side
Until the day I die?

Babydoll listen to me and stay with me
And baby you will see
So many things that I can do cause you're my fantasy
You know i'm stayin dedicated when it comes to you
I'm thinkin about you cause you know
I wanna be with you
You`re tellin me I give you my corazon baby
You better be tellin the truth and keep it real
Thats if you love me
We`ll listen to oldies
You`re takin the time to get to know me
Just love me slowly
And don't you never leave me lonely
Cause I will never be the same if you would let me go
I'd rather die
Babydoll I just want you to know
It's all for you
You know i'm always stayin true
Just listen to my song cause this ones dedicated to you

OoOh what would you do {*3X*}

[love me]
Would you hold me closely
In this time of need would you be there for me
[love me]
Would you remain by my side
Through these rough times and keep your hopes alive
[love me]
I know you're there for me
I'm here for you too baby confide in me
[love me]
Would you faithfully stay by my side
Until the day I die?

*spanish verse*

Baby if you love me
Tell me
I need to hear you say the words
So I can feel it in my heart
And know that I am yours
Will you do anything for me
Like hold me closely
At those times i'm feelin lonely
Girl just know understand
And comprehend
I'm in it through the
Thick and thin until the very end
But I really need to know
If I can count on you
Trust you with my life
So I can have a child with you

OoOoh what would you do {*3X*}

[love me]
Would you hold me closely
In this time of need would you be there for me
[love me]
Would you remain by my side
Through these rough times and keep your hopes alive
[love me]
I know you're there for me
I'm here for you too baby confide in me
[love me]
Would you faithfully stay by my side
Until the day I die?</pre>
