They dont really care about this music
They dont even know how to use this

I said they dont really care about this music
They dont even know how to use it

I use this shit to get up, I use this shit to go to sleep
I use this shit to get up, I use this shit to go to sleep
I use this shit to get up, I use this shit to go to sleep
I use this shit to get up, so get up

They usin this to advertise, enable savage lies
They always play the role, better stratagize
Do you really believe or only criticize?
You phonies this disguise never fooled me
I wear no jewelry, I play it cool see
Dont follow rules he said
To a dame he wasn't in, he was never my friend
He wasn't down wind
I used to sleep on floors, and I only knew my pen
I grew within and spread throughout
Listen my routes mission
Is about liftin myself and about kids and
Disposition you might take with ur bitchin
But if I didn't bitch, they might never listen to this
And wonder is that about me
Well now really what you about
Progression and makin money
Profession yeah thats funny
We do it in the streets for fun
Since I was young, hip hop made adrenaline run
And I was dumb, to think it was the same for all
But now that I know, I got alot of blame for yall

Fuck people in positions of power who trip with their power
Probably wont what you got to, plus more soul they are sour
Its been happening forever and a day but nows the final hour
Ur not the smartest ones, they got the largest guns
We will crumble your tower

I use this shit to get up, I use this shit to go to sleep
I use this shit to get up, I use this shit to go to sleep
I use this shit to get up, I use this shit to go to sleep
I use this shit to get up, so get up

Well now the people who run this biz dont know the culture
And the people who run this biz are a bunch of vultures
Im a bull
But I define gravity, you dont wanna get sad with me
What a travesty
Your majesties a fake
To laugh with me is to relate.  I chuck at the fickle fucks till they fuck me up
For years I wait
So many peers I reach but I stay limited
And then we lit candle in the wind growin timid with it
Why am I so hard to satisfy?
And anyone who I think can  is always mad they try
Any other lads who are fly, they fly by
Just below the radar, but Im glad they made it far
I had to play my part no body else could
Lookin back on all the strugglin but thats what really felt good
And thats crazy but Im not, thats a used up trait
What I got is a devine fate
My mind state fluctuates
And Im up late
Fuck hate I got love in the face of that cuz I learned thru rap
I never burn you back I just vent
Even after all of my last efforts have been spin I give 100%
And wonder who sent you or I to be the true speaker and freak it till they die

Fuck people in positions of power who trip with their power
Probably wont what you got to, plus more soul they are sour
Its been happening forever and a day but nows the final hour
Ur not the smartest ones, they got the largest guns
We will crumble your tower

I use this shit to get up, I use this shit to go to sleep
I use this shit to get up, I use this shit to go to sleep
I use this shit to get up, I use this shit to go to sleep
I use this shit to get up, so get up

They dont really care about this music
They dont even know how to use this

I said they dont really care about this music
They dont even know how to use it

I use this shit to get up, I use this shit to go to sleep
I use this shit to get up, I use this shit to go to sleep
I use this shit to get up, I use this shit to go to sleep
I use this shit to get up, so get up</pre>
