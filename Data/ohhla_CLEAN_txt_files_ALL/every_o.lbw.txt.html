shawty got potential
tell me what the issue
If don't call you right back I aint tryna diss you
I know you like me
take
I know I do shit you don't like
Instead of left I don't know why I can't treat her right
she be like why we don't eat out no more
why we don't go out no more
all these spots says I don't know
she say I'm just like every other nigga
damn I guess I'm just every other nigga

bow
ok she on a nigga case again
askin me why we don't go out
why we always in the crib
I say ima superstar
baby that's just how it is
she don't wanna hear that
she like tell that to another bitch
she like it cuz I'm not famous
like your ex huh
what you don't care about me
bow where the love gone
and when I treat you wrong
I do it for a reason
guess I'm something like a drug
the way lil mama be feenin
and she never gotta worry
money stacked up to the ceilin
even though she not my girl
don't like when I'm with other women
good man you deserve it
right now I'm feelin worthless
I don't mean to make ya sad
I don't do it on purpose
and we both pisces
man she just like me
sometime I say some stupid shit
that make her wanna fight me
deep down inside
I know that she that ride
or die chick
smoke weed cook good
always on her fly shit

shawty got potential

she be like why we don't eat out no more
why we don't go out no more
all these spots says I don't know
she say I'm just like every other nigga
damn I guess I'm just every other nigga

going threw my magnum box
counting all my condoms
yea we fuss and fight at times
lately I been outta line
baby ima change
I know you heard that shit
a thousand times
baby we just need some time
we don't need to rush
complaining bout me play madden
telling me to grow up
but I can't even lie
man lil mama hella jealous
sometimes I just wanna kick it
watch the game with the fellas
but I can't cuz my shorty
wowlin out all the time
I can't take this shit no more
so right here I draw the line
she a real chick
she would do anything for me
like when I kissed ty banks
I had to hear that shit for weeks

and buy her a wedding ring
and you already know what counts
It's the little things that do for ya
