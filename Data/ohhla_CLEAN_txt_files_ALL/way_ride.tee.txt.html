[Chorus]
Swingin through with some'in new, top down ridin clean
Swingin-swingin through with some'in new, top down ridin clean
Top-top down ridin clean, top down ridin clean
Swingin-swingin through, swingin through, top down ridin clean
(In my city it's the way we riiiiiide)
Swingin through with some'in new, top down ridin clean
Swingin-swingin through with some'in new, top down ridin clean
(In my city it's the way we riiiiiide)
Top-top down ridin clean, top down ridin clean
Swingin-swingin through, swingin through, top down ridin clean
(In my city it's the way we riiiiiide)

[T.I.]
Ay, got my top down on my Bentley, I keep it pimpin the most
285 I be hittin, even when there's nowhere to go
My wrists'll hang out the window, my Roley shine and it shimmer
You see that bad bitch who wit'cha? If I want I can get her
Make her a active disciple, a MDMA{?} dipper
Make my suite presidential and then I fill it with strippers
Man I got chrome on my wheels, and your hoe on my dick
Ride around no roof on my whip, that's how you know I'm the shit
They know I'm rich, it don't matter bruh cause as fresh as I be
What she do for you you pay her, what she do for me for free
Cause I'm a G, still kick it with the trap nigga buyin things
Swingin through with some'in new, top down ridin clean

[Chorus]

[T.I.]
Ay, my old school is official, got them horses under my hood
Yeah I'm ridin 'round on yo' side of town and I'm blowin O's of that good
In the summertime I got to be, in the flyest ride, who higher than me?
Nigga catch hell tryin to follow me, I bet Pimp C proud of me
I got the city lights in my rearview, we loud and can't hear you
Got a billion in my mirrors, it could be closer than it appear to
Blowin big, stacks, all we do is that
Valet my shit in fear, fuck up a chick at Saks
Then it's back to the drop, hit the gas, burn a gat
Got my double cup filled up, pint of lean sealed up
Broad lookin for me broad day whenever I'm seen
Swingin through with some'in new, top down ridin clean

[Chorus]

[T.I.]
Ay, ride quarter million C-A-R's nigga, try me bitch you'll see AR's nigga
Got purple stuff in my 20-ounce, I got bubba kush in my cigar nigga
Pull string, no guitar, put down, roll the dice, what they hit for
I don't know if this is yo' bitch but she on my dick, you better come get her
Don't want me on yo' street with this clean paint and these white seats
She's gon' be inside here, and you have no idea
how she be tryin to get up in the whip whenever I'm seen
Rollin through with some'in new, top down ridin clean

[Chorus]</pre>
