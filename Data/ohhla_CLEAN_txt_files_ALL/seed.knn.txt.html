Typed by: AZ Lyrics

It's not a miracle that I am here today
Life has been been difficult
But I'm not typical
I mean a long long time
I go I should have died
But see my blood's on fire
I can't help but survive

I never ran away
I done being afraid
Put it on my name
No matter what the stakes
Look it in the face of danger
'Cause sun has never been a stranger

I was the seed planted by lovers
In a refugee camping over seas
I grew free I grew more roots
And became a tree
So now they never gonna cut me down
Oh no, they never gonna cut me down
Oh no, they never gonna cut me down
Oh no, they never gonna, never gonna

My skin is black and green
Nothing you haven't seen
You know my history I stand for victory
They turn their backs to me
They taking x to me
I got my wait up now
Nothing can knock me down

I never ran away
I done being afraid
Put it on my name
No matter what the stakes
Look it in the face of danger
'Cause sun has never been a stranger

I was the seed planted by lovers
In a refugee camping over seas
I grew free I grew more roots
And became a tree
So now they never gonna cut me down
Oh no, they never gonna cut me down
Oh no, they never gonna cut me down
Oh no, they never gonna, never gonna

Oh a oh e I know how
Oh a oh e I survive now
(Oh a oh e I know how
Oh a oh e I survive now)
Oh a oh e I know how
Oh a oh e I survive now
(Oh a oh e I know how
Oh a oh e I survive now)

I was the seed planted by lovers
In a refugee camping over seas
I grew free I grew more roots
And became a tree
So now they never gonna cut me down
Oh no, they never gonna cut me down
Oh no, they never gonna cut me down
Oh no, they never gonna, never gonna</pre>
