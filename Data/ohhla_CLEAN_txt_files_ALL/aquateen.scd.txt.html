My name is..
Shaka Zula, the mic rulah, the old schoolah
You wanna trip, I'll bring it to ya

Frylock and I'm on top
Rock you like a cop
Meatwad you're up next
With your knock-knock

Meatwad make the money see
Meatwad get the honies G
Drivin in my car, livin' like a star
Ice on my fingers and my toes
and I'm a Taurus

Ha ha, check it, uh, check-check it, yeah

Cause we are tha Aqua Teens
Make the homies say ho and the girlies wanna scream
Cause we are tha Aqua Teens
Make the homies say ho and the girlies wanna scream

Yeah
Aqua Teen Hunger Force
Number one in the hood, G
