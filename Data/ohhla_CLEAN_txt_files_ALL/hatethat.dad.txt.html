[Intro]
Yeah
Aiyyo turn the piano up
Can you feel it?
Yeah like that
This the way love feels
Yo check it

[Diddy]
Are we livin in vain? Are we livin in pain?
Girl remember my name (remember my name) and whatever remains
After we walk on white sand - let's travel in style
Just want to see you happy and smilin
I can change your life in one flight
Let's take off tonight, c'mon

[Dirty Money]
We go, we go down
Love is in, then it's out
We can tell, tell by now
If it won't, work out
Let's not forget, back in Brooklyn
Where the future, first began
Let's start again (start again) it can't be over (can't be over)
That's what I told her, that's when she said
(That's when she told me)

[Chorus: Dirty Money]
I hate that you love me, so much boy
I hate that you hurt me, so much boy
I hate that you love me, so much boy
I hate that you hurt me, so much boy
I hate that you love me

[Diddy]
One time is enough for me (c'mon)
Close your eyes, there's much to see (let's go)
So let's jump and both touch the clouds
And we never come down, it's amazing the view here (it's amazing)
On top of the world where even the air is all brand new here
Fireworks like New Year's
Hurt is old news, why would you shed new tears?

[Dirty Money]
How can you, trust enough
when our time, our time is up?
if I leave, will you
walk away, from the truth?
Let's not forget, back in Brooklyn
Where the future, first began (c'mon)
Let's start again (start again) it can't be over (can't be over)
That's what I told her, that's when she said

[Chorus]

[Dirty Money]
Things I know now don't allow me to turn back
We've been through it all, but now I just want my heart back
And I could walk away but see your love is my weakness
Oh it would be pointless to try and that's why

[Chorus]

[Outro 2X: Diddy]
You hate that I love?
Cause I know how to love
You hate that I hurt?
Cause you hurt me</pre>
