[Meek Mill]
One thing's for sure, two things for certain
Got booked with three bricks, you back home, niggaz working
Clown ass niggaz, should have put you in the circus
Home in Philly if you get a benz, niggaz lurking
Churches, hearses, is it really worth it
If you heard he telling why you dapping and conversing
Lock me in the cell, let me strap on my Converses
Before I drop a dime, tell them people a line
Swear to God, man I was nineteen I caught my first case
Nine co-defendants and snitching wasn't the worst case
Had a hard time giving my name and my birth date
But nowadays, niggaz go to jail and it's a earthquake
They get all shook up, write a whole book up
Ratting their connect out, telling where they got the hook up
Got a niggaz twenty years talking about that cook up
Back to the home, niggaz fucking with him, good luck
Twelve shots of henny to the face, got me stood up
Any situation asked about me, and I stood up
Catch you slippin like a transmission, fuck your hood up
From my hood, to who your hood, good, what up
Ugh, nothin though my hundred high
This Mac will leave a nigga look like Sponge Bob
Hold up, yeah, uh, yeah
I said all I know is Flex, shittin on my ex
Bad hoes on my team, dick 'em down like next
I rock YSL so fresh, fly as hell, no jet
Waves on them 360s make that pussy get so wet
She say I'm cocky, I say that's not me
She call me papi and I say ven aqui
Wrist wear on hockey, Porsche Box like Ali
My sneaks they Bally, in my Hood I'm probably
Just rolling round in that Ghost, watching out for them folks
Heater on my hip, trunk full of that work
I say my shooters like Dirk, 10 racks and you merked
I put that on your head, first week and you dead
I bottle pop, I model pop
Catch me on them bikes like there autopop
Niggaz know I'm nice, and I got a lot
Like F your corner, nigga, I'll buy the block
It's Maybach, we way back
Yeah I was starvin, this the Payback
It's off the top, hahaha
What I tell you
I got my hustle from Hova, and my stuntin from Baby
That's why I'm fuckin 'em over and my new watch only 80
Got a couple of Rovers, had a drop one Mercedes
I know these suckers don't like me, I'm probably poppin they lady
I got 100 racks on me now
No computer but I got a Mac on me now
And I'm a shooter and I really clap homie now
And fuck the jail cause my nigga Ross hold me down
I'm skippin bail and we in this bitch, fresh out the dealership
I just came in the game but I'm killin shit
That nigga Wale, hahaha, yo

[Meek Mill]
Let me tell 'em, dreams and nightmares
I had a dream like Martin Luther
I was in the Phantom getting brain like a Harvard student
Check my record for the fame, ain't really hard to prove it
Went to jail, came home to that kitchen just like Martha Stewart
With a Pyrex trying to make a nine stretch
Just was in the yard with lifers, working on my biceps
You would think they all was like us, they ain't have my mindset
When I was missing sleep and working weeks to get my mind set
And to get my son right so he don't live my young life
Cause I remember some nights I used to hold that gun tight
Middle of the jungle trying to make it to the sunlight
Stillmatic with that pen and pad just give me one mic
And I'm going get richer, they gone get sicker
Why they mad at me, cause they ain't in the picture
Cause they was on some bullshit when they starting flickin
And the camera starting flashing, niggaz came up missin
Ha~! Ha~! Let me get it, uhh
(Meek Milly MMG hit us up Hot 97)
(You know what it is, Maybach Music)
(Yo Stalley you got somethin for us real quick?)

[Stalley]
Black charvelles on them blades, boy
Dark shades, leather jacket like I'm Blade, boy
Come through a city like what's the focus boy?
I come though like open doors
Six by nines through theses door panels, make a bunch of noise
I'm mobbing on these back streets and city blocks
Middle finger every cop
Chevy block engines, everything is heavy stop
Sweat pants, the car dance, I make that bitch do the wop
I'm losing my religion
Got these angels on my shoulders and they telling me to listen
I blast this alpine and get lost in my system
They telling it's devil music and demons have imprisoned
My mind, body and soul and I'm traveling down hell's road
This strap got no Velcro
So I'm down for whatever, whenever, wherever
Any way the hell I go, you think I'm scared and here's your answer
Hell no! (Woooooooooo!)
(You see? MMG it's goin down we here)
(You better believe it, shuttin it down)

[Meek Mill] + (Rick Ross)
Every night I'm on the road, tryin to get how it come
Still findin time just to kick it with my son
I know niggaz see them bribes and it's lookin like it's fun
But when you out to get that cake, you gotta pick every crumb (HUGH)
Yeah, you gotta pick every crumb
I never thought that I see that day that I get up out the slums
Did it for my team, put them on some ones
And every day we shittin on them, we them niggaz with some runs
I was outta control, block was hot as a stove
I was out with them O's, same time the block was patrol
I can't even remember it man I got too many bars right now man

[Rick Ross]
