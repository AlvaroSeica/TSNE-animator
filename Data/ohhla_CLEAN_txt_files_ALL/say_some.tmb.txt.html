[Chorus]
[Drake - Singing]
This shit was all I knew
You and me, only
And I did it all for you
Still you were lonely
We can work it out

[Drake - Rhyming]
Uh, but I guess things change
It's funny how someone else's success brings pain
When you're no longer involved
That person has it all
And you're just stuck standing there

[Drake - Singing]
But I'm gon need you to say something, baby
Say, say somehting baby
Say something baby, say, say...
I'm gon need you to say something, baby
I'm gon need you to say something, baby
Oh oh...

[Verse 1]
[Drake]
Uhm
I am the topic of conversation
This is celebration
Let's toast to the fact that I've moved out my mamma basement
To a condo downtown, 'cause it's all about location
I'm sitting, drink wine and watch californication of life
You should have been here to kick it with me
We could have split this whole thing up, 50 - 50
But now I'm at the 40/40 getting bitches tipsy
Killing shit, the ever so talented Mr. Ripley
How I go from being the man that you argue with
To me and Dwayne Carter putting out the hardest shit
I should wanna go back to the one I started with
But I'm addicted to this life, it's gon be hard to quit
Yeah, just ask me how things are coming along
You could tell me that you've never heard none of my songs
As long as you end up saying one day you plan to listen
Cause what's a star when it's most important fan is missing?

[Chorus]
[Drake - Singing]
This shit was all I knew
You and me, only
And I did it all for you
Still you were lonely
We can work it out

[Drake - Rhyming]
Uh, but I guess things change
It's funny how someone else's success brings pain
When you're no longer involved
That person has it all
And you're just stuck standing there

[Drake - Singing]
But I'm gon need you to say something, baby
Say, say somehting baby
Say something baby, say, say...
I'm gon need you to say something, baby
I'm gon need you to say something, baby
Oh oh...</pre>
