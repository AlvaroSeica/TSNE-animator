Conversations Amazing
In my 4, shorty's in heavy rotation (4-sho)
Thinkin to myself like, this is the one
Broke her down, told shorty how to do this hun! (4-sho)
Neva gave her tha cold shoulda'

She walks like a model, the girl is so fresh (so fresh)
I got a few of them, here's what I do to them (what chu' do?)

Hop in the wip!

[Chorus]

[Baby]
Ay! now i'm about to test ya' p's lil bow wow

She bout 25, and she been lookin at cha'
Pull ova' there in ya ride on 22's and bust her out!

[Bow Bow]
I know this girl named keisha
she's no groupi
be far from the stars
22's made her choose me
Like oowwee!
Tellin' all her friends in the benz
He don't really look 16 do he?'
112, youngest thing on tha scene
Couldn't believe when i seen
How she sqeezed in them jeans
Looks like a tight situation
Make a young man make flight reservations
Just step, no intimidations
I'm bow wow boo
Accept no imitations
Should have seen tha looks on they faces
The Ice plus light, makes for good converation
You tellin me
It's a felony, to yell at me
I blew her mind she was dazed momentarily
But luckily
She stayed for some theropy
I stay pimpin heavily
My game spittin therolly (ha ha ha)

[Chorus]
