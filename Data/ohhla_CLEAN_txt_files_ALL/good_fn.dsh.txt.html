[Intro]
Ay girl..
Tryna get awesome...
{Kane is in the building, nigga}

[Roscoe Dash]
How-How-How-How they let me go and get a beat from Kane?
I swear these 808s' and snares make me go insane
Ay hold up baby girl, I really wanna know ya name
and let me be ya Superman and you be Lois Lane
It's +Showtime+ like cable (Go!), get up on that table (right now!)
I love yo' sexy body and I know you love this paper (I know!)
The bottles comin like they got legs on 'em
The way I kill 'em, man this beat will make 'em wanna call the feds on me

[Chorus]
I'm orderin a hundred shots of Patrooooon (hundred shots of Patroooon)
Girl you better get a cuuuuuuuup
And once I get you hoooooome
Girl you better give it uuuuuuup (and we gon' have a hell of a time)
And we gon' have a good fuckin night, good fuckin night, fuckin night
Good fuckin night, good fuckin night
And we gon' have a good fuckin night, good fuckin night, fuckin night
Good fuckin night, good fuckin night
(We gon' have a hell of a time)

[Roscoe Dash]
Maaaaaaaaaaaan~! 
I got a open palm with cash in it (I do!)
I could be in for MVP, I'm just tryna out-do my last visit (dayum!) 
Pockets fat like they pregnant and 'bout to have triplets (Whoa!)
I let twenties fly and send ghetto Benji' to ad-lib it (I do!)
Ha, get it? I'm, so far ahead of my time, no C-section
Y'all club, we V.I.P. section
Party bus full of women like we NEXT'in
Woulda thought it was a gym the way we flexin
Line full of sexy ladies tryna get with me
I'm just tryna grand slam like the boy Ken Griffey
and, I'm at the bar, nine shots, no +50+ (50)
Fuck it, bring a hunnid mo', ERR'BODY gettin' tipsy

[Chorus]

[Roscoe Dash]
Annnnd, and we gon' have one hell of a time
Girl, I'm feelin fine
You know what's on my mind, give it up (Please!)
This, man, and my Swisher got me flyin, this Patron got my mind
and yo' sexy lil' body got me stuck (Daaayum!) So what's really good?
Girl, I wish we really could, do what we really should
I know yo' last boyfriend was only really good (I know!)
Well I'm excellent, a sexual perfectionist
I creep up behind ya, deep inside ya, no Exorcist
That's that extra shit, real long and extra thick
A different type of breed, a upgrade from that metric shit
It's type to make ya question all the rest you messin with (I will)
I'm tryna tell ya I'm the one to hit the exit with

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Annnnd, and we gon' have one hell of a time
Girl, I'm feelin fine
You know what's on my mind, give it up
This, man, and my Swisher got me flyin, this Patron got my mind
and yo' sexy lil' body got me stuck, so what's really good?</pre>
