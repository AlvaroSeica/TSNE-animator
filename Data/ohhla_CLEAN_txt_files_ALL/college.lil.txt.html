Based freestyle!
Ay holla at me
My niggaz go crazy like "Holla at me"
All my bros and all my dogs
What's up? We're in college bro!!

Yes; I'm at the frats
Fuckin with my college bros
Yes; I'm at the frats
Fuckin with my college bros

Yes; we fuck college hos
I'm drunk off beer
All my, boys go crazy
Yes we're in here

Yes; I'm at the frats
Yes; I'm at the frats
Yes~! I'm at the frats
and I'm never, coming, back

Yes; I'm at the frats
Yes; I'm at the frats
Yes; I'm at the frats
and I'm always, coming, back

I always, go, to the frats when I want to find some hos
Always go, to the frats, when I want to get some dough
Any time you want to find some motherfuckin boppers
Go to the frats and they'll suck dick like an opera

I love college
I love college
I love college
and I love the knowledge

Lil B for Lil Boss
Based freestyle for my college bros
