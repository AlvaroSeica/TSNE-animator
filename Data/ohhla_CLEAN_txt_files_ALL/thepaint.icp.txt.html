(Today we'll be talking about the reporting artists The Insane Clown Posse)
(They look too spooky) Dickface (It kinda reminds me of gang related) 
(Before the anti-christ who is comming)

Remember me bitch 8th grade
ball park skinny ass well-fare aid
Ustler and Bruce brothers we was the shit
Dungeons Dragons, and Bruce Lee flicks
quit school nobody missed us, 
nobody hugged and kissed us only dissed us
now look at these beautiful model type high class women
takin' my dick in em
you don't remember my kind in class
the whipped out freak starin at your ass
never had the courage to even say hi
only smell your perfume vapors as you walk by
I'm the scrub that never crossed your mind
now your flashing your titties at me waitin in line
and that's fine while you're working your charm
look beneath the paint bitch its the scrubs who won

*People murmuring*

You used to say "Ahhh Hah!"
look at him the same pair of pants and that shirt again
an outcast I knew I had to do something
figure out a way to make something out of nothin
open up shop got what you need
speakers clothes CD's or bags of weed
but that shit got me nowhere except jail
me and all my homies to broke to make the bail
so now we're right back at the place we started
chuckles and laugh the second we turn our backs
assed out but we was like "fuck yall"
we got each other and the drop of the homie call
look at us now bitch holdin' platinum
all up on my dick but I'm the same as back then
forget the money and fame because 
beneath the paint life's just as it always was

*People murmuring*

Look at me!
Analyze! What you see?
Look at me!
Analyze! What you see?

another girl I don't dare to confide in
playing that role it hurts inside
here I am thinking she wants me
she only wants that killer on her CD
just when I couldn't feel any worse
bitch asked me if I could paint my face first
the day I finally get to leave this land
behind the paint will be the shell of a used up man
behind the paint will be the shell of a used up man
the shell of a used up man
the shell of a used up man
behind the paint will be the shell of a used up man (Analyze!)
the shell of a used up man
the shell of a used up man
nothing left but the shell of a used up man
nothing left but the shell of a used up man
behind the paint will be the shell of a used up man (Analyze!)
the shell of a used up man
the shell of a used up man</pre>
