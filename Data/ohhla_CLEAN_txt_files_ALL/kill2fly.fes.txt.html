[Intro: Fes Taylor]
Can't stand that nigga
Yeah, that nigga think he the shit
Fuckin' 2 Fly, fuck you
Yeah, fuck that nigga

[Fes Taylor]
You see, Taylor killed Profes and Taylor want 2 Fly to die
Cuz 2 Fly stealin' all his shine
See I'm on the grind, run up on him with nines
But the niggaz that he rolled with lied so he decides
I'ma ride, catch him after the club
And the niggaz in the street, like what happened to Doug
Get him, rub, shotgun, lay him down in the tub
Leave coke in the room, then say it's over drugs
And the cops don't like him, cuz they can't catch him
Even tried to strip-search him, lookin' in his rectum
They'd probably be glad to see him in a bodybag
Won't even see it comin' in a hockey mask
Now his life shorter than a fuckin' jockey on the ass
Kill him and the donkey when I blast
Nigga turn on me, put him on to everything
Fuck my wife was with me, when I brought the weddin' ring
Plus the niggaz spendin' and shit, like we already rich
Son, I'm gon' cop the five, this nigga gon' cop the six
Created this nigga, how he out-shinin' me?
Sometimes it comes to an end, maybe it's time to be
Nah, no, fuck that, I do it myself
Looked in the mirror, I saw it but, who was myself?
Put the gun down, nah son, yo it ain't worth it
Had to realize we really the same person...</pre>
