[Talking]
(baby) oh yea it's official baby (oooh baby)
Lil' O...Chamillionaire

you gotta thug bounce to this (say - hey)
you gotta thug bounce to this (say - hey)
you gotta thug bounce to this (say - hey)
you gotta thug bounce to this (say)

[Chorus - Chamillionaire]
Everytime we hit the club - lookin good on deep dish dubs
rollin deep with all our thugs - it's hard not to think about you
Everytime we bounce around - chunkin up our side of town
yellin out it's goin down - it's hard not to think about you

[Verse 1 - Lil' O]
Man it's time to hit the club we gon'get it started
we gon' celebrate for our homies that's departed
you ain't gotta ask why we actin all retarded
pourin Cristal on the floor we can afford it
and we celebratin for our doggs who ain't here
cause they done passed away, or they gotta couple years
I ain't gon' lie mayne I gotta couple peers
that I ball for regular, it be sheadin tears
so I be up in the V.I.P. smokin on that fire leaf
if you ain't on that purple dogg you ain't as high as me
the only thing missin mayne you ain't out in sight of me
I always knew you had my back if anybody tryed to jump
and now the crowd buck cause the jam just came on
we ain't broke no more man they playin our song (hey, hey)
look at how lil'mama shake in her thong
mayne the way we ball tonight, mayne yo'name gon'live on - cause

[Chorus - Chamillionaire]
Everytime we hit the club - lookin good on deep dish dubs
rollin deep with all our thugs - it's hard not to think about you
Everytime we bounce around - chunkin up our side of town
yellin out it's goin down - it's hard not to think about you
Everytime we hit the do', fire up and hit the dro
hit the bar, and get the Mo' - it's hard not to think about you
Everytime we bounce around - chunkin up our side of town
yellin out it's goin down - it's hard not to think about you

[Verse 2 - Lil' O]
We gon'do it big tonight bring some mo'liquor
come on picture man come and snap us some pictures
might not write alot, but I always sent you some flicks bruh
that's just the way a thug says that he miss ya
man I wish that you could see the broad that I'm dancin with
the way she work her hips, you can tell she can't handle it
you already know Lil' O I'm a dismantle it
next cock back man I'll body slam - a - bitch
now the clubs super packed, V.I.P is fired up
shots of Patron got everybody wired up
ain't another click in this bitch that as live as us
sippin on exeption tell me who as fly as us
but you ain't here so it just ain't the same
only real, gutta cats feelin my pain
the playas always switched - but the game stayed the same
guess what tonight for us, I'm a snatch some dames - cause

[Chorus]

[Chamillionaire] + (Natalie)
This is a dedication (hey, hey), for all the ones who ain't here (hey, hey)
but it's a celebration (hey, hey), so put ya hands in the air (hey, hey)
we miss ya, we miss ya - we love ya, we love ya
but mourn ya, but morn ya - until we join ya, until we join ya

[Verse 3 - Lil' O]
So if you ballin for ya partnas, G's get ya bottles up
grab some bad broads by the hand, told 'em follow us
she whispered in my ear "Lil' O it's a lot of us"
I whispered back "baby outside I got alot of trucks"
and after the club, man we headed to the strip club
you already know how in H town we get buck
sittin in the back of the Range, gettin my dick sucked
you already know mayne you 'pose to be with us - cause

[Chorus]</pre>
