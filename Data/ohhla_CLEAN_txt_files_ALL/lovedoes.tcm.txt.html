[Chorus]
We hear a lot about what love is
You don't hear too much about what it does though
Love gives, and looks out for the next person
And gives out your best, even when they deserve your worst and
Some have a little, some have a lot
It's not about how much you got, the point of the plot
Is if you have any love at all, you need to share that with the have-nots

[Phanatik]
Too many people know about hurts
And spend their lives livin' on the outskirts
Some without work, some without a decent pair of pants and a shirt
Others just on a search for purpose, it ain't strange for pity to meet
kids that grow up in the city streets
That go to bed hungry, three or four nights out of the week
And not because they don't like to eat
The price of life is not cheap, but it feels free for some
But someone's gotta pay for the freedoms we enjoy
You see the military convoys we employ
Both on foreign lands and on American soil
Some serve out of duty, some live out and truly
Embody this thing that's called love, love is unforced
And it runs it's course despite the cost and it never comes up short

[Chorus]

[Phanatik]
They told the man who only owns a few scraps
To pull himself up, by his own boot straps
Now he can't even find two boots that match
So tell me how he's supposed to do that?
No love, they told the boy with his clothes all torn
Early one morn' to stay well and be warm
Ok, they didn't ignore'm
But was it that they couldn't or that they wouldn't do a little more for him?
The father of the family of five
He's jugglin' jobs, struggling to keep his family alive
Tryin' to hold on to his family ties
Needs to be lovingly, nudged to bring his whole family to God
It's not all sob stories
There's a lot of activity that could bring God the Glory
Often donations are made
Or time is spent with orphans or with patients with AIDS
This is love in action, sometimes love is tough actin' like Tenactin
Cause even when it hurts, love will still choose to speak the truth
And won't remain hidden, instead of bringing reproof

[Chorus]

[Phanatik]
They're those who give freely
It's easy for them to share the love that they have with the needy
Then there's the greedy
You gotta earn every smile they give and you never catch a freebee
What is it that makes one man give
And makes another man, put a lock on his, and say "I'm not gon' give?"
Maybe it's the difference in the way that he thinks God forgives
What he thinks he sees, he does such
If he sees he's been forgiven much, he loves much
But if he thinks his sins are mad small
Then he's never seen love so he can't give it at all
To him it's just
As if he's earned everything that he has
And he never needed a gift and he made it without love
But what is it that he has that hasn't actually come down to him from above?
