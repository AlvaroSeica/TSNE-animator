	"Hands off, copper, hands off, copper!"
		"Some people never know" -&gt; Chuck D

[D.O.P.]
You didn't think you saw a puddy cat
What you saw was a black duck
Played and portrayed like he was wack, what the fuck
Was you doing? The image of the duck you tried to ruin
So we were pursuing, like Wile E Coyote
You dig it? Sylvester and Tweety, Gonzalez was Speedy
But the duck I bet nobody knows he was supposed to
Represent a nigger, you wonder how we figure?
Cause when Bugs got the laugh, Daffy got the trigger
Elmer Fudd was a goddamn blood clot
So how that sucker own a mansion and a yacht?
He got paid through exploitation of a brother
So to speak, whose lips resembled a beak
Now he's known only as the late-night fronter
You've seen the last of the great white hunter
Removed without no further ado, now smoking crack
Or macking honeys with Pepe Lepue
See you didn't think we knew the plan
Of the possibly understand, Daffy was a black man

	"That is correct! Absolutely 100% correct!"
   		"Some people never know" -&gt; Chuck D
	"How do you like that, simple mover?"
   		"Some people never know" -&gt; Chuck D
	"There's something awfully screwy going on here"

[Amen-Ra]
You're just dispicaple, the way you thought that we were jigaboo
And to belive and receive Bugs as a recieve a note
He's not too colowful, so why even should we?
We hate the freaking flag, how the hell can we like Woody?
The wood-chewer, who always tried to do a
Buzz or was it because of the fact that Buzz too is black?
Porky Pig would have loved that (That's all, folks!)
That's right, that's all folks is wack
Act like you didn't notice or uncover a brother
In beaks and feathers instead of sheeps and leathers
Whatever the reasoning for rabbit seasoning
They thought we were dumb, got slick and picked the chicken wing
Painted it black and called it a Mallard duck
But Mallard ducks are grey, so now what's up?
And the brother like Ra has come along
I brought the map, D.O.P. brought the gun along
&gt;From New York City down south to Selma
Be very, very quiet, we're hunting Elmer
Your days are up, your times are numbered
Be right and exact and (Boom!) Daffy was a black man

	"How am I ever going to catch that screwy duck?"
   		"Some people never know" -&gt; Chuck D
	"Precicely what I was wondering my little nimrod"
   		"Some people never know" -&gt; Chuck D
	"That's all folks, that's all folks..."
