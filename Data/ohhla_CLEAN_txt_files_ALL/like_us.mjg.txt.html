[Eightball] 
Rollin' down Park Avenue bumpin' maze 
My Caddy with them switches, got them bitches in a daze 
Niggaz on the gank, smokin' dank, goin' nuts 
And all I see is dope and dead niggaz bloody guts 
Sometimes I go and click and smack my bitch up with the gat 
Or blow up niggaz cars, cause I heard they call me fat 
No I'm not a wimp, cause the pimp is in my nature 
I got too many hoes bein' away, but ain't my flavor 
I'ma dope seller, stick 'em up, killer or whatever 
Game from slangin' birds, 211 or 187 
Smack up my bitches on the street that owe me ends 
Learn from the start, in the game ain't no friends 
Just a lot of bitches with they hands out 

[MJG] 
Whatsup with that? 

[Eightball] 
Smilin' in my fuckin' face, stabbin' me in my fuckin' back 
All up in my business, whatsup with my grip bitch? 
Steppin' up, one nigga died with a mouth full of pimp shit 

[MJG] 
Whatsup with the bitches aye? Whatsup with the bitches aye? 

[Eightball] 
Fuck me, suck me, jack me, 'til my diggidy-dick ejaculate 

[MJG] 
Whatsup with niggaz aye? Whatsup with the niggaz aye? 

[Eightball] 
Tell 'em not to fuck with some niggaz like us! 

Hook: (4x) 
??????????????????? 

[MJG] 
I'm reachin' for the pump and the loaded automatic 
It's 6/5 bombs from the box in the attic 
A phone call from Eightball let me know the scope 
T-Money and J.B. had to scope a young hoe 
Not a true bitch, but a true bitch nigga 
We rollin' thick as hell so how the fuck that nigga figure? 
His gun nor his gang is gonna be a threat to us 
With 1 fire bomb, 1 got him at the dusk 
And the nigga down with me said:(Damn G you been having gank?) 
And at that very moment, he was askin' me to shank it 
A nigga ain't suppose to smoke a trick and get sad 
And thats the first example of a killer goin' bad 
I gotta take him out, if he live he'll confess 
So Eightball you ready?(Yeah) 
Shoot him in the chest *1 Shot*(I got him) 
One mo' motherfucker dead over bullshit 
Guess he didn't really know the niggaz he was runnin' with 
M.J.G., Eightball and Killa-B 
Lil' Han and J-Smooth, T-Money and J.B. 
Lettin' these imitation motherfuckers know 
Niggaz like us don't be headin' to the flo'..HOE!
