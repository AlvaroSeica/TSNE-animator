[LongShot]
Yeah, one two one two
My name is LongShot, I got my man {?} on the beat
This is _Civil War, Pt. 2_ the mixtape
Bang bang wit'cha, boy
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go ill {*2X*}
Check it out

I did 10 days at County, which way you figure I'll go
I won't let 'em lock me down, I got a career to blow
Plannin discipline in my life to keep me alive
Most of my closest folks don't believe I'ma rise
Fine, I don't fuck with the dice or the stick
But gamble these lines with these guys, all that ramblin shit
And I ain't talkin 'bout they travellin; I'm talkin 'bout
rappers that wanna be me when I see 'em at rap shows babblin
Always talkin 'bout battlin, fuck that
I'd rather stab you in the abdomen and take your puff sack
But that, would just be me bein violent again
That's why I roll solo for dolo, I'm liable to flip
Pull from my nickel bag and liquor flask
Now I'm gettin drunk with a blunt filled with skunk, nigga pass it
I ain't tryin to have no kids I'm 25, livin broke
So I gotta roll the seeds up when I smoke, chokin

[repeat 2X]
First (nigga stand up) second (get yo' hands up)
Third put your motherfuckin body in motion
And just bang wit'cha wit'cha wit'cha
bang wit'cha wit'cha wit'cha
bang wit'cha wit'cha wit'cha
bang wit'cha... boy</pre>
