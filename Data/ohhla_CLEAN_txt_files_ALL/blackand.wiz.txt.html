Yeah uh-huh, you know what it is
Black and yellow, black and yellow
Black and yellow, black and yellow
Yeah uh-huh, you know what it is
Black and yellow, black and yellow
Black and yellow, black and yellow

[Chorus]
Yeah uh-huh, you know what it is
Everything I do, I do it big
Yeah uh-huh, screaming that's nothin'
When I pulled off the lot, that's stuntin
Rep up in my town when you see me you know everything
Black and yellow, black and yellow
Black and yellow, black and yellow
I put it down from my whip to my diamonds I'm in
Black and yellow, black and yellow
Black and yellow, black and yellow
Black and yellow, black and yellow

[Verse 1]
Uh, black stripe, yellow paint
Them niggas scared of it but them hoes ain't
Soon as I hit the club look at them hoes face
Hit the pedal once make the floor shake
Suede inside, my engine roaring
It's the big boy, you know what I paid for it
And I got the pedal to the metal
Got you niggas checking game, Im balling out on every level
Hear them haters talk but theres nothing you can tell 'em
Just made a million, got another million on my schedule
No love for 'em, nigga breaking hearts
No keys, push to start

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Got a call from my jeweler, this just in
And bitches love me cause I'm fucking with they best friends
Not a lesbian but she a freak though
Come stay for one night, I'm shining all week hoe
I'm sippin Clicquot and rocking yellow diamonds
So many rocks up in my watch I can't tell what the time is
Got a pocket full of big faces
Throw it up cause every nigga that I'm with *Taylored*

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Stay high like how I'm supposed to do
That crowd underneath them clouds
Can't get close to you
And my car look unapproachable
Super clean but it's super mean
She wanna fuck with them cats
Smoke weed, count stacks, get fly
Take trips and that's that, real rap
I let her get high if she want and she feel that
Convertible drop feel, 87 the top peel back

Yeah uh-huh, you know what it is
(Yeah) Yeah uh-huh, you know what it is
Y'all already know what it is man, if you dont, you should by now
Rep up in my town when you see me you know everything
Black and yellow, black and yellow
Black and yellow, black and yellow
I put it down from my whip (Taylor Gang) to my diamonds I'm in
Black and yellow, black and yellow
Black and yellow, black and yellow
Black and yellow, black and yellow

[Chorus]</pre>
