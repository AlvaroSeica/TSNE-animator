[Verse 1]
I walk with a head full of fire and a belly full of hunger pain
Uncontained rage takes hold 'til I'm numb again
Clear the air like summer rain
It's just another day seen through the eye of the hurricane
Runaway train of thought, my sore knuckles say love and hate
Huffing shakes straight 'til I suffocate
B-boy unengaged til my brain's buzzin', ain't nothin' changed
Decorate grey skies with colour; spray paint tornadoes
Fallen angel with a worn halo, moonwalk on a rainbow
Multi-verse space ghost writer, spit a day-glo one-liner
The tongue tied long timer, invisible ink specialist
I think devilish, sipping on a alcoholic beverage
Livin' with benefit cheats and no-hopers, stoners
Deadbeats who sleep on the sofas
Socialite soldiers glued to the Motorola, worldwide like Coca-Cola
Weed network, exert energy the head-nod expert
Trenchfoot puttin' in legwork, the wordsmith
Still lifted off the first spliff
I levitate in space, let the earth drift
It's sickening; instinct without discipline
Livin' in a world where everybody hears but nobody's listening
It's like mission impossible try'na hop-scotch every obstical
Death's never optional, it's the epilogue to the first chronicle
The black comical

[Cuts: Jehst &amp; Ricochet Klashnekoff - Nightbreed]
"Its the return of the drifter
Lone wolf former jacks, roam road like a ridge back
Contents under pressure
Shabby tap I walk aggy with a hunch-back"

[Verse 2]
Soldiers hold a cold stare like they never been scared
But live life like they know their time's precious 'n' scarce
Beef could be hell on earth, better settle it there
And if our sins are forgiven heaven better prepare
I bring a breath of fresh air, bless polluted lungs
Bunged up from the years bunnin' zoots of skunk
I lounge in bluesy clubs with abusive thugs
Useless drunks, junkies abusing drugs
And young bloods with the loosest tongues, it's too much
Old cats sacked up like they loosin' touch and get bust
Some are truly stunned, another rabbit in the headlights far too confused to run
I stay balanced like planets with the moon and sun
I need shoes on my feet and some food to munch
If you relate to that statement salute me once
One love, one hope for the youth to the future comes
It's comes now, I'm drunk and run down sun up to sun down
'Cause life is bugged out, some doubt us, but couldn't survive without us
Parasites surround us like close encounters of the 3rd kind
Cyclops with a 3rd eye, deep in my trees like a termite
Toke up the herb 'til it burns bright, burn rubber on the turnpike
Prey stays locked in my search light, word life

[Outro]
"Yeah, adventures in new bohemia, the drifter is now housebound
and all you snotty nose spoilt little gallagher wannabes
yap-yappin' barkin' at the front door
Don't know what happen now
Yeah yeah Braintax on the boards, lowlife"</pre>
