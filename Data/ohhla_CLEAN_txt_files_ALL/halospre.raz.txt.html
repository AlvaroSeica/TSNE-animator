Maccabee Ridaz, Renaissance Child, let's go!!

We ride out, wit angels, they all die, wit halos

We ride out, wit angels, they all die, wit halos
We ride out, wit angels, they all die, wit halos

[Hell Razah]
Knock, knock, who is it? I'm back
Stop the gimmicks, I pop-pop the biscuit
and shut down ya businesses
They wanna whitewash, scan, copy my image
While I became a menace 'cause I found my limits
They opened up the book of life and seen my name in it
Same sentence showed my wages of death if I ain't living
Ask the Lord for forgiveness of sins that I committed
Even Solomon predicted you can't die with your riches
Of course, don't pillow talk when you lie with them bitches
Each verse be worth money like Egyptian pictures
It got worse since the Bush's took that torch from Hitler
Pour out liquor for my dead comrades, I ain't forget ya man
A lot of sex but I'm no Caligula
I'm living hip-hop, son you just a visitor
A lot of faces and the names is similar
I build with the O.G.'s down to superiors, yea

(Chorus)

[Hell Razah]
In this modern era I be a terror black Che Guevara
On wax I'm like anthrax wrapped in a letter
My berretta is for them slaves with forgotten graves
Like the names of Dred Scott, I'm aiming with headshots
With scopes and red dots on old prejudice cops
Who plot on dope blocks when coke measurement drops
There's more drugs in schools for kids with no pops
My hood is like a cemetery
They gave us project tombstones and sanctuaries
This for them kids outside that's in the military
No matter Bush or is Kerry, they both want us buried
There's a war outside, I hope you getting ready
Get off ya celly and stand up and grab a semi-
Automatic, for any static, Maccabee Military, yeah

[Chorus II: Hell Razah]
First we hit 'em high, then we hit 'em low
It's either Heaven or Hell, you pick the way to go
First we hit 'em high, then we hit 'em low
It's either Heaven or Hell, you pick the way to go
First we hit 'em high, then we hit 'em low
It's either Heaven or Hell, you pick the way to go
First we hit 'em high, then we hit 'em low
It's either Heaven or Hell, you pick the way to go</pre>
