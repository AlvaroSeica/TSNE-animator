[Trey Songz]
He so magnificent hoe niggaz dissin him
Hoe nigga mad cause his hoe start whisperin
Ooh shit look at him new shit glistenin
Wish I was oh girl wishin I could get with him
Homey stop cuffin her gotta let her go
Only for tonight if it's love she'll come home but...

[Trey Songz]
Aye girl... ya man is in the way girl
You need to get away girl
Gind a place where we can go get low
Don't you tell me no cause I'm right girl
Let me excite ya life girl
Yes I'm tryna get ya lovin
I never said that I was being ya husband
Girl

[Trey Songz]
I guess I came in and threw off his whole swag
Look at himself looking at me like dag
How can I be why can't I be like that
April ain't ya momma and Claude ain't ya dad
You ain't been pimpin them since you was a lad
He's in linen and he don't smoke swag
You're in denim and it looks real bad
So give up the girl and I'll give her right back

[Trey Songz]
You want it baby I'll show you a thing or too
I'm on it baby I would preform for you
This vibe is crazy I know what I wanna do
Get low don't you tell me no (oh girl)
You just lose ya fool girl
I'm tryin to get ya lovin
I never said that I wasn't being ya husband
Girl

[Trey Songz]
Back again like a nigga left somethin
Still up in the spot know I'm still stuntin
Look over the way and this niggaz still frontin
Look over to Trey and a nigga feel nothin
Look over to babe and she wanna say somethin
Look on her face she wanna lay somethin
Send my girl over there bring that girl over here
Me, her and my girl hello my name the shit </pre>
