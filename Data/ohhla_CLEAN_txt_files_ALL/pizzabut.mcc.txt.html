[Intro]
I got the jam, the jam that make you go to work
Work! Work! Now work, that pizza butt!
I got the jam, the jam that make you go to work
Work! Work! Now woooaahh ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

[mc chris]
It's so hot, urn your mouth
Scar tissue, make you go OW
Cheese must cool and congeal
Slice with a coke is a no joke meal
It's a quick bite that can't be beat
It's a pie chart that you can eat
It's a done deal if you don't delete
so bust the calories with the pizza beat
No oregano bits in your pretty little smile
Not even garlic bread, no Chi-town style
Gonna split your threads, you don't moderate
Yo I'm breakin in your 'fridge like it's Watergate
You're bulimic come the weekends you would seek a pizza beacon
Your actions speak of Atkins but you're cheating when you're eatin
An emotional abortion, you're divorced from delivery
Little league or literally some Italy wildebeast
So begin now you're the winner in your motorized cart
It's game over: roller coaster with your oversized parts
In denial, it'll be awhile, you act now and submit
I cut the crust off pizza butts and lift them titanic tits!
Aaaaaawww...

[Chorus: repeat 4X]
I got the jam, the jam that make you go to work
Work! Work! Now work, that pizza butt!

[mc chris]
You need help, I'm that guy
Sayin hey lady, put down that pie~!
You're so fat you eat cars
Totally in love with your Wolverine scars
Some say Polo stole it from China
Some say your stomach ate your vagina
Is it delivery? no, it's DiGiornno
Let's microwave it and put in a porno
Can't beat it, wouldn't see 'em eat it
Can't miss me because it's so crispy
But you need to backtrack
cause they're givin helicopter tours of your asscrack
You got grease soaked up but you're pukin in a bucket
Send a deep dish home bring it with a tip home with the mush top
Parents kinda like it with the BJ pepporcinis
You only got one piece but went back cause you need it
You need to slow down when you mow down, get your ass hypnotized
It's a big boy breakfast buffet not a kids Slip-n-Slide
Pummel two pies for one price but those cards they can cost
It's Parker Brothers pizza party, just drop like it's hot

[Chorus]</pre>
