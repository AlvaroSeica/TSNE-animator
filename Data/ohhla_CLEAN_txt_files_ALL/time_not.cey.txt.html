CHORUS-
Times not to be wasted / each and every move that we making 
steady yet patient/ open up the cages/ for all our relations 
keep the fiyah blazing / signs of revelation / got no time for hesitation
get right or be taken to this higher meditation
its a fight for liberation worldwide waging

Time is of the essence the present is a blessing
and its known we in the west where my people stressing
the evil presence of fear keeps em second guessing
from adolescence to manhood my progression has taken time
not no overnight flight do the math to the path that created the I
motivated the grind inspirated the rhyme
gave you the fist lesson the year was 99
and it was right on time a strong mind unblind 
young and wise brung the element of surprise 
Sellasie guidance made I graduate despite
any obstacles in the path of my life it just took time

Times not to be wasted / each and every move that we making 
steady yet patient/ open up the cages/ for all our relations 
keep the fiyah blazing / signs of revelation / got no time for hesitation
get right or be taken to this higher meditation
its a fight for liberation worldwide waging

The whole time I've been alive Mumia's been inside
trapped on death row behind enemy lines
remember the crime convicted aint always been committed
evidence gets hidden judge and jury stay trippin
paid by the government to keep the public ignorant
in a babylon law its guilty til ya innocent
and whos an immigrant we livin in an indian burial ground
and right now its like the truth is stereo sound 
and what goes up must come down
and what goes out comes back around
thats why we bound to make a change still breakin them chains
from way back in the day to right now we say

Times not to be wasted / each and every move that we making 
steady yet patient/ open up the cages/ for all our relations 
keep the fiyah blazing / signs of revelation / got no time for hesitation
get right or be taken to this higher meditation
its a fight for liberation worldwide waging

Whats the fastest growing business in this whole country
it be that private prison industry and aint nothing funny
money gets generated by the system segregated 
racism celebrated the hatred is blatant
we facin discrimination criminalization
2 million locked down with incarceration
all poor brown and black its war we under attack
so recognize the fact that slavery aint back
it never really left reread the 13th amendment
they legalized it as punishment with no pretending
giving mandatory sentences for minimum offenses 
non violent drug offenders in the same cage as killers
once i been caught slippin had to spend sum time sitting
never ever considered snitching gathered evidence to get acquitted 
listen the mission is to stay up out the system way up out the system
free em all thats the bizness its time 

Times not to be wasted / each and every move that we making 
steady yet patient/ open up the cages/ for all our relations 
keep the fiyah blazing / signs of revelation / got no time for hesitation
get right or be taken to this higher meditation
its a fight for liberation worldwide waging</pre>
