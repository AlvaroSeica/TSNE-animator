[Mannie - talking]
Ladies and Gentlemen, boys and girls, lil' children, dogs and cats
Right about now you are listening to the incredible drum patterns of
DJ Mannie, Fresh, Fresh, Fresh
Fresh, Fresh, Fresh, Fresh
Fresh, Fresh, Fresh, Fresh
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN!

[Chorus]
[Mannie Fresh] I'm a buy cars, I'm a get clothes, I'm a rock jewels
  Marble on floors, I'm a blow tweeds
  Got alot of drinks, steppin out, gators, coca-cola mink
[Juvenile] I need it in my life, I want it in my life
  Come put it in my life, I'm a keep it in my life

[Verse 1: Juvenile]
Its ya boy Juvi, from the Magnolia, still loc'in
You girls gon' know whats up with me, bust it wide open
Loose chest, loose booty, round down and up
If a gangsta can't touch it, what you bouncin it fu'
Now give me leway, watch how a G play
Watch how my name get caught up in he she say
It's UTP say, we with the streets hay
They represent us when they hear us at the DJs
Break bread with me player, demand with me
thought we was people your supposed to spend your cash with me
I'm in here last with me, hold me down
Give me a whip, give me a trick and let her blow me down
I'm so gutter, I'm so slick, I'm so grimy
I promise you something, I bet you gon find me
I'm a eat, purchase, whatever I please
CO, give me the keys, aww please, I need two of these

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Juvenile]
I'ma be so courageous, and so contagious
'Til my fuckin rap sheets gonna receive mo' pages
Listen to Juve cause this my year mon (my year mon)
+400 Degreez+ and I'm bout to kick it in gear mon (in gear mon)
Don't you see the soldiers and vogues when I appear mon (appear mon)
About bein written on my face cause I don't fear none (don't fear none)
Me and my team got a scheme to go light the block up
Skip's movin the work, and Wacko poppin the chopper
I scream the "U" cause I mean it
The difference is you be throwin yo' shit up when you scream it - I seen it!
Shit all the obstacles that I been through
What made you think, I'ma be scared of a bitch like you?
I'm ya dawg, let me get it on consignment
You ain't paid them last people yet, dawg, don't even remind me
I gained knowlege, my game polished and it's obvious
You can't block it, you can't knock it, this is profit!

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Juvenile]
Can I untape the clips and chill?
Show my bricks is real?
Can my people shop in Beverly Hills?
I got alot of work I know thats gonna be ahead of me still
But my beast mentality gon' keep me ahead of the field
Pardon me, but I got paper to chase
Now cut all your talking and bring me straight to the safe
I know where the cameras at and I'm destroying the tape
I'm not leaving no evidence but a feret to the trase
I had a problem on my hand, a few bills I hadn't been payin'
I figured about a lil' less than 75 grand
And my dog Rocky caught a nickel for a pistol
Its serious when the federales comin' to get you
Life is at a standstill outcher in this damn field
What you say can get you and ya mans killed
Its my last chance to come up, its gotta be hit
Juvi come another first round lottery pick

[Chorus]</pre>
