[DJ Khaled]
If you ain't talkin money, we ain't talkin
This is DJ Khaled
Lex Luger {*echoes*}

[Young Jeezy]
I cain't even walk, my pockets too heavy
Got that 40 on me now, them choppers too heavy
Told 'em you gotta fall back I can't sneak you in the club
He said "I'm in the car, you need me my nigga nothin but love"
Last blunt, say it wet, so much smoke I can't see ya
Ain't over here, look I wouldn't wanna be ya
Talkin so many bitches, we got bitches on bitches
Way she movin that ass I think the bitch got switches
Pull up to this bitch Escalade full of killers
The only thing realer Escalade full of scrilla
Louis V to the back, half a rack for the snapback
Wiz Khalifa's on the coupe I'm talking "Black and Yellow" flapjacks

[Chorus: Young Jeezy]
When I talk I be talkin 'bout money
So please don't talk to me if you ain't talkin 'bout money
Weed, coke, ecstasy, nah we talkin 'bout money
Don't know what went wrong with me, cause I be talkin 'bout money
We talkin 'bout money
Let the money talk (money) {*8X*}

[Ludacris]
Hahahahaha, LUDA~!!
I'm talkin 'bout money you never seen, hoe
The Incredible Hulk, so much paper I'm turnin green hoe
Green giant, I want it, I buy it
Y'all just ballers on a budget FUCK your money's on a diet
And I'm laughing you such a riot, David verse your Goliath
Let my money talk for me - hear 'em? Be quiet
Hamilton said "What's happenin?" Jackson said "What it do?"
Grant chucked up a deuce my Benjamin said FUCK YOU!!!!
Ahhhhh, it cost money to fund a war nigga
AHH'll have you layin right on the floor nigga
and take you higher, I'm a lover not a fighter
But if a rapper's gettin gassed then I'm the first with a lighter

[Chorus]

[DJ Khaled]
Mo' money, mo' problems
So bring the problems - I love it!
This We the Best Music Group, Y.M.C.M.B.
Bitch I don't see you!!
Bitch get your money right bitch!
Hustle hard
I'm f'eal about this shit
Get money!

[Chorus]</pre>
