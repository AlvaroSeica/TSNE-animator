[Chorus: Dice Raw]
Time flies when you're having fun, hah
Time flies when you're having fun
Time flies like bullets when they fly out the gun
Pull it out on the corner and everybody run
Time flies when you're having fun, yeah
Time flies when you're having fun
Why we live so reckless when life's so precious?
I hope lil' homies get the message, time flies

[Dice Raw]
Yo, they ask where I'm from and I say Philly
North to be exact, you know, where they act illy
Recognised worldwide, the best in the city
with Samantha and Miranda, "Sex and the City"
The real life version, all night cursing
Gambling, smoking, cops come dispersing
Shit, I was eleven with the 8 ball jacket
in the early nineties in the Porsche designer glasses
that I still wear, custom made, Ric Flair
North Philly, South Philly, yeah we in here
Used to jet from the party when they shot up the rear
Now we put a hundred shots off in the air
That's Platinum Patron though, please be clear
Flash the high beams in the face of these deers
They start panicking the moment they get near
The kick and the snare, that's when I sense fear
I'm so sincere about my yesteryears
that I belong to, and I've conformed to
as an {?}, and also acting unlawful
But also, acting plain awful
When you wanna buy your life back
true fact is they don't sell souls at Costco
At the end of the road we all pay a toll
and yo, I know what it cost, so

[Chorus]

[Dice Raw]
Aiyyo, they used to hang out and shoot hoops
Now they wanna shoot at each other's coupes
Started hanging out in different loops
Stopped hanging out with each other, making different loot
Somebody said you said something, but you didn't
Then you said you going head-hunting, yo you tripping
Somebody said something you didn't say
Still riding round the way with the windows rolled halfway
with the loaded 'K, don't even wanna talk
Just pull up, and let the bullets spray
You know they kicked it back when they was kids
Now they wanna kick doors in where you think each other live
It's fucked up, but that's how it is
when you add on the distance, build on resistance
and never realise the indifference
Friend or foe, can't remember the difference~!

[Chorus]

[Dice Raw]
Time slips through our hands like sand inside an hourglass
'How long does it all last?' is the question I wanna ask
cause time slips through our hands like sand inside an hourglass
'How long does it all last?' is the question I wanna ask

[Chorus]
