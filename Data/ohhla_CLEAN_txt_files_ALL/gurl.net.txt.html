[Matt Martians]
Open the door
I look you in your face realize I don't love you no more
You ask me why
Reoccurring thoughts of him are there; you'll never understand
You
You asked to be put on this level and I ignored you
And now I see
What life is like without you there, so the bong is where I stare

[Chorus 2X: Syd Tha Kyd]
Girl, you know I love you girl
You know I care

[Syd Tha Kyd]
Rain clouds
Seem to like to follow me around since I lost you
Ask me how
I could leave with something so small and unsure
like I didn't love you anymore - but you
Pushed me to a level of insanity, I know
Now, all I ask
is if I ever had a chance or were we never gonna last?

[Chorus]

[Pyramid Vritra]
Texting me "I love you" as you getting dicked down by an old flame
At least you asked first while you would flirt at them home games
Fuck it I'll let it slide, like everything that you do
For everything thing that you do, innocent girl while in school
But as the moonlight crept into her vacant room
She she's in the cooper naked, breaking curfew, nuts, and zippers too
Sea ocean blue after the hundredth argument, dipped just as quick as you
Re-equipped with a new beau and my crush hates me now
I'm 50 states away, still asking about your day
And if you listen to the album I sent you
You shouldn't expect an answer and it's it fine shit I'll find some new bitches
And if you do return by any chance it still stands that you want me
I'll be in the same state you left me
Alone, or maybe I'll be with a bad bitch and I'll reject you
And tell you that you're nothing special
But you are... but I probably won't</pre>
