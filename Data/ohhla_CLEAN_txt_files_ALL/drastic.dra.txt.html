The way that I been talkin the way that i been walkin
Got niggaz in a daze and hoes they amazed
Now how could I be stopped some bars or some cops
Some haters or some glocks this shit be treel
In the presence of dealers and niggaz that don't care
Some niggaz that keep a quart and bust they glocks in the air
My guillotine and infantry they marchin like troops
Bullets vestes and choppers man fatigues and boots
Keep my distance from bustas don't fuck around with suckas
Cause them all brand niggaz will get you fucked and dealt with
For me I don't play no games the 2000 John Wayne
Shoot em up bang bang up in here like Jesse James
D-R-A-M-A don't want now days

Chorus 1x
It's drastic it's drastic
Zippin bodies ni plastic in plastic
Puttin niggaz in casckets in casckets
Nigga this shit is dratsic it's drastic
Zippin bodies in plastic in plastic
Puttin niggaz in casckets in caskets
It's drastic

Nigga where I live don't try me because I'm treel
And keep a crome in case ya'll niggaz don't wanna a test
What the fuck you thanl gotta be about my bank
Ya'll niggaz be jawjakin who me I'm bout klik klakin
And they steady bustin it's time for repurcussion
Keep my enemies close and uh act like I'm ghost
Godby be my chopper and always keep my strap
Cause down here round here bring it on why don't ya

Chorus 1x

I got 12 barrels of C4 rocket launchers and grenades
Assassinated (?) to show these that I'm made 
Now who in the fuck gon stop me I got power like a gotti
Just call me Mr. Lou the one that taught the rule
Leavin niggaz delirious this shit here serious
Niggaz runnin into death like a bad case of diarrhea
And when the slug hit your chest your gonna burn like on a grill
I done told ya once I done told ya twice
Bitch this is drastic

Chorus 1x</pre>
