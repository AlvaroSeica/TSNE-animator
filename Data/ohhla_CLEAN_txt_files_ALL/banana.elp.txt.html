[Killer Mike]
Ey, ey...
I move with the elegance of an African elephant
I presented the evidence eloquent as the president
Evident is the emphasis, I deserve me a championship
But before I banana clip, I'ma chill so my man can rip

[El-P]
Little man against hellion with a heart of an orphan
I got the words of a murderer and a eye for distortion
You take a slice of my portion, I'll take a piece of your profit
I drive at illegal speeds and keep an oz in my pocket

[Killer Mike]
We run the jewels in your town, a quarter pound on my person
I'm known for poundin the stage, I'm talkin burnin and cursin
Producer gave me a beat, said it's the beat of the year
I said, "El-P didn't do it, so get the fuck out of here!"

[El-P]
You wanna hang? Bring your throat, I got stools and a rope
I'm a slang pope haranguing the land with a man's flow
A new addition to the art of the old code
That's fully retarded and put a part in your bold dome

[Killer Mike]
'ey El, 'ey we the villians, we antagonist bad guys
Mercy me, merciless me puttin pain in they sad eyes
It's time for Skywalker talk cause meet the true Darth Vader
I hit your mom in '03 but a G ain't ate her
So baby boy, you should tighten up and show some respect
Before I Melvin on ya Jody, put my arm on your neck
Or worse yet be the reason your girl want a divorce
Be at your crib with your kids sayin, "Fuck your fort, lil nigga!"
Hahaha!

[El-P]
The style is radiation leak at Mile Island
Also known as Chernobyl talk, listen for the sirens
For the green I'm a hoarder, you're the, poor distorted
Sorta, morbid sonnin these fuckin whoredome explorers
I'm board, nuff of ya bummy shit, it's numb to the core
Sure you suck a good dick for the fame and couldn't resist getting played
I fuck like I'm headed to war, I'm REALLY not playin no games
But tag me goddamn it, I'll kill the carrier mentions my name

[Killer Mike]
Hey I'm a soldier of fortune, a mercenary on beat
I'm merciless, I torture MCs', tie up both of they feet
If they refuse to run the jewels, we beat the bottoms of feet
I'm talking grip pliers, guys, to the top of ya teeth
Hey me and Jaime killed the competition, top of the heap
is where we stayin with their corpses resting under out feet
I sent they mom a lil' cash and a sympathy letter
Told her she raised a bunch of fuck boys, next time do better, BITCH!

[Big Boi]
We the old Atlanta, new Atlanta, future of the city
Daddy Fat Saxx don't give a damn, cause can't na'an new nigga get with me
Now it's true niggaz are simply simple-minded, Simple Simon
Being dumbed down by the loacl radio stations by designing
But what I be rhyming, no payola is required
My bank account obese as fuck while yours sits on a diet
Nigga your lease is up, you're fired, quiet, that's how the boss talk
Retain ownership on everything, every car bought
and payed for, no neighbors cause I'm sittin on acres
Went to Vegas, jumped the broom cause I wasn't trippin on papers
or no prenuptial agreement for mama
If we broke up and she took half, I'd still be sittin on commas
8 figures, nigga! (Nigga, nigga, nigga...)</pre>
