Cause I can't stand it
(I can't stand it)
You can't stand it
(ou can't stand it)
Is this the way it's plann-e-ed?

[ VERSE 1: Captain Rapp ]
You better wake up to what's goin down
Your eyes are closed but your ears hear the sound
Death cries in the wind, the thought makes you cringe
He's dead and gone, you lost another friend
Who was young in age, but old in sin
Gangbangin, hangin, he was slingin the juice
The skunk was bunk and his death was the proof
Another life ended all too soon
With a tag on a toe in a coroner's room

Bad times - these are for real
Bad times is what you and I feel

[ VERSE 2: Captain Rapp ]
The world evolves while my nation's sore
The American dream is unseen for sure
And ( ? ) where you work ( ? ) company loss
The boss must minimize the staggering cost
You get a day off, a layoff
And a letter to stay off
And now you don't work no more
That position at the plant you really did need
Head of the house, five kids to feed
You tried everything, and it's just not fair
To have a able-bodied man apply for welfare
A city cries out, it's mass hysteria
One wounded, four dead in a California area
Innocent victims found home slain
Relatives and neighbors experience the pain
They hold back tears, just got to take a stand
Order padlocks and guns in a heavy demand
The fears won't rest until they're all behind bars
For the rest of his life the boy will carry the scars
Best friend, mother, father and a very young daughter
Memories in his mind, loved ones have been slaughtered
Is there any way to compensate
A person's life, so great a fate?
Heaven knows it can't go on
Too many things are goin wrong
Who will save us from ourself?
This world has turned to hell

Bad times - these are for real
Bad times is what you and I feel

Help me, help me, help me, help me
All those odds, they're all out to get me
Wars on Earth, when will it cease?
I'm bein robbed, so I call the police

Bad times - these are for real
Bad times is what you and I feel

[ VERSE 3: Captain Rapp ]
Weather plays havoc on the eastern states
Floods, hurricanes, and you can't escape
Tornados drop trees ( ? ) and debris
Leavin little behind but death and injuries
Gonorrhea, syphilis spreadin like the plague
Doctors afraid to treat the victims of AIDS
The world is threatened by a nuclear war
Americans die in El Salvador
The Pope holds court and hopes for solidarity
In a speech to see the people's ( ? )
Begin meets Reagan, Camp David accord
And they say Reagan will run in '84
Bad education is just a relevation
But still each year kids regret graduation
The third world sends out a hunger plea
Genetics runnin loose, sexual child abuse
The Bible tells us it's just a prophecy

Bad times - these are for real
Bad times is what you and I feel

[ VERSE 4: Captain Rapp ]
Inmates emprisoned, life on death row
Guards, gates and ( ? )
Never really knowin will they ever let you go
While the courts are sayin: Son, we told you so
You're a menace to society, a threat and danger
We sentence you to die, to death by gas chamber
Can man says it's proper to take a life for a life?
The only real judge is the almighty Christ
A woman who loves you, she thinks about your plight
Hurt and worried, few visitation rights
Sittin home pregnant, considered the options
Driftin between abortion or adoption
The distortion of abortion is the devil's strategy
Created by the economic uncertainty
Lawmakers who monger, lawbreakers in hunger
You struggle for power, we all feel the plunder
Terrorism, cynicism, communism, suicide
Atheism, animism, brutalism, homicide
Heaven knows this can't go on
Too many things are goin wrong
Who will save us from ourself?
This world has turned to hell

Bad times - these are for real
Bad times is what you and I feel

[ VERSE 5: Captain Rapp ]
Headrags and khakis, dress code of the gang
Guns and knives and you're down to bang
Your family's poor and life's a big bore
To survive in the ghetto you must be hardcore
You just kick it on the set, a job you never sweat
Cause a application form is too complex
Your brain deflated by ( ? )
A lady with the thought of snatching her purse
An elderly victim leaves her home
Headed for the neighborhood savings and loans
You tip and you sneak to elude her eye
You wanna grab the purse on the very first try
But your timing is off and you committed yourself
You say to get this purse you're gonna go through hell
So it's time to get rough, but she called your bluff
You pulled out your knife and you cut her real tough
She was murdered on the street, short of her time
Another little old lady a victim of crime

Bad times are for real
Bad times is what you and I feel
