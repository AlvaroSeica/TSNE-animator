[Talib Kweli]
Welcome to the new age, where they're thirsty for that Kool-Aid
Thirsty for the first on that page, really thirsty just to be fake
Be the first to hate what you say, tryin to diss you callin you "gay"
Such an urgent need to express yourself but really nothin to say
Don't fuck with us, we too tough, get high like you do drugs
Like spit me out, I'm chewed up - my life's chopped and screwed up
I know you up in this club, I know you don't give a fuck
You told me what you don't like, you made that clear, now what do you love?
There's gotta be more, some live the life of the rich, some people gotta be poor
I've been through it all, I will not sell you a dream, that's what the lottery for
The music is clay, I shaped it, I molded it, like it was pottery or
the mouth with the law, twist it like Robert Duvall, son, the godfather raw
Free as the diamond you found on the floor, I furnished the rhyme with the proper decor
I burnished the nine in my mind with the gloss so the burner will shine when I'm poppin it off
To top it all off your style is married to substance, you sound like it got a divorce
That's why I block and unfollowin y'all, I done forgot what I'm followin for
Enough about y'all now back to me, ain't no academic leave, I'm not faculty
These new slaves ain't ready for my masterpiece, so when they hear me rap it's catastrophe
Cause a casualty is so casually, they mistake what I do for havin beef
I don't actually, wish anybody harm, now stretch your arms and clap for me

[Interlude: Talib Kweli]
Clap clap clap clap clap clap clap clap
Clap clap clap clap clap clap for me, uh
Clap clap clap clap clap clap clap clap
Clap clap clap clap clap, now bring it back, uh

[Chorus 2X: Talib Kweli]
Wake up cause no you're not dreamin, catch up with us cause we leavin
Got enough, followers, I'm lookin for some new leaders
I'm lookin for some new leaders, I'm lookin for some new leaders
Got enough, followers, I'm lookin for some new leaders

[AK]
(Oh Lord) Ever since the day I was born, that marks the day I was chosen
to rise above them all and be a leader, I'm like Malcolm X when on the podium
Martin Luther with a dream, Rosa Parks on the bus, though as funny as it seem it remind me of us
Through the money and the fame ain't shit gon' change for the light we adjust
Do it for the children without a ceiling to live up under
Times gettin hard, that's why my niggaz smoke that tropic thunder
If all our people spreaded love instead of evil
We would prosper our conscious to a level with no equal lethal
Stay true, I gave you my oath, what would the ancient God my nigga Thoth
Through all the books and the screens I was taught, I look at myself and tend to learn the most
Our leaders dead and gone, what's left for the believers?
If you lookin for the truth, one word: "Underachievers" nigga

[Interlude: Talib Kweli]
Clap, clap, clap, clap (let's get it, let's get it)
Clap, clap, clap for me, uh (put your hands together)
Clap, clap, clap, clap
Clap, clap, now bring it back, uh

[Chorus] w/ ad libs

[Issa Gold]
As I change the so-called predestined course of my life
Advance my shit so now I travel at the speed of light
Movin these intricate insecurities out of sight
Movin myself onward from the darkness into the light
I take flight, it's goodbye, to all the negativity
that plague millions of young innocent souls like me
Gave me the genius mindstate necessary
to feast off of this unlimited figurative tree
of life, I tried to tell these niggaz that our purpose is to move it
Somethin like Darwin's beliefs of humans in evolutions
As I fall asleep on these social forms of materialism
I wake up and go through more colors than your normal prism
Would you rest my soul? I'm blindin me to a blurry of visions
In light of me on what to cut with such gifted precision
And now I'm truly livin (bless up, bless up)
And now I'm truly livin (bless up, bless up)

[Chorus] w/ ad libs

[Outro]
Na-na-na-na-na na, whoa-ohh {*5X*}
