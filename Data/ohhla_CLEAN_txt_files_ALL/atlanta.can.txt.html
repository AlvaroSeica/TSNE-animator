Song:   My Home Atlanta
Typed by: jla_aka_alpha@hotmail.com

It's that crunk crew, it's that crunk crew
Blackened brothers in that crunk crew yeah

(Chorus x 2)
I love my home Atlanta
My red and blue bandanas
My slackin southern grammar
Them sexy go-go dancers
Cadallacs on hammers to braves hogs ballers and bangers
Those marijuana smokers them marijuana planters

I wake up in the morn
Turn my playstation on
Just bought that NFL blitz and that basketball
I be deriving songs
To see what's goin on
I let my hair grow long maybe braid it in the fall
Whenever I get bored
I just jump in my car
I go to Lennox mall and look for independent broads
Sometimes I get annoyed
They treat me like a scrub
I go down to the schools
Maybe I'll get more love
3 pm in the evening
I'm on the highway speeding
My front left tire's leakin
Should have bought a new one last week-end
I guess I wasn't thinking
Up ahead break lights were blinkin
For more than 30 minutes I was stuck in gridlock prison
This traffic drives me crazy
Goin west on 280
Five a bitch almost made me
Crash into her Mercedes
I'm glad I almost missed her
I pushed the clutch and shifted
It was a white lady I'd rather hit a sister
Cause see I know the system
It's easier to trick them
I use my g to pimp em and convince them I'm the victim
Naw baby you hit me
No I was in lane 3
You need some contacts you can't see
Naw girl you can't blame me
Don't panic just be patient
Give the bitch the wrong information
She'll probably never claim it scared of high insurance payments
I love my home Atlanta I love my home Atlanta I love my home Atlanta

Chorus x 2

The land of pretty peaches
Girls with round features
Make a nigga say good Jesus these hos are dime pieces
Start it off like what's your name
Tell me what's your age
You got a man
Can we be friends
I'm glad you feel that way
Come on and ride with me
I'll take you to that crunk bar where them sharks eat
5 stars baby
bon appetite
I got that shrimp appetizer with that dark meat
If shorty wanna creep
I'll bring her home with me
Just bought some candles and that Carl Thomas cd
Bootleg that Jay-Z
Stole that Outkast
Been had that Keith Sweat
I know how to make it last
Smack that naked ass
You got a big butt.
I ain't in no rush plus she like it rough
Keep your stuff locked leather and handcuffs
And those things you wrap around a mans you know what
That's why I love Atlanta I can hardly stand-up
I'm a heavy drinker
Fix me a cup and sinker
I always love Atlanta
That's why I love Atlanta I love my home Atlanta I love my home Atlanta

(Chorus x 2)

As a youngster I was so damn bad
Used to drive up the Ave with no tags
Niggas couldn't see me I was goin so fast
Most niggas catch whiplash and crash
Face all chipped up from the glass
Runnin from the police holdin ass
If I get caught I'll just give them some cash
Most police give me dap and laugh
Other ones pull out behind the flash
Take the night stick and tap the glass
Tell me turn the music on it's on blast
Turn the engine off cause I'm wastin gas
Tell him that I'm lost and I need a map
Looking for a hotel to take a nap
Freenik off so I came for that
It was good last year that's why I'm back
That's when they tried to hit me
His big fist barely missed me
I have my camera with me
I think I'll sue the city
I love this place Atlanta that's why I love Atlanta
I love my home Atlanta I love my home Atlanta

(Chorus x 2)
