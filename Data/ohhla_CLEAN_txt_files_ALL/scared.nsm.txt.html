[Greg Nice]
Aww man, aww man
The landlord, keeps stressin me
God, ohh, bill collectors is just ringin my phone off the hook
Oh my God my {?} is up
I won't be gettin no more monthlies from them
Oh my God, they say money is the root of all evil
But umm...

[uncredited singer]
Get money - scared money, don't make no money
Say what say what; get money - scared money, don't make no money
Get money money - scared money, don't make no money
I ain't afraid no more - scared money, don't make no money

[Greg Nice over singer]
I ain't afraid, Nice &amp; Smooth ain't afraid
Ed Hall ain't afraid, we ain't afraid baby we ain't afraid

[Chorus: Greg Nice]
Now, do you want the fly girls? (GEAH!)
You want the fly cars? (YEAH!) You wanna be a star? (YEAH!)
But scared money don't make no money
But scared money don't make no money

[Greg Nice]
Dug deep in my pockets, nothin came out
A thread and lint UHH what's that all about?
Even Big Willies take a spill sometimes
No doubt, I gotta stay on the paper route
Now it's time to blow, peace to Rob, peace to Show
I still get my cut, from a brother Denny Moe
Slow and low be the tempo that I flow
Sippin on the Heine', puffin on the 'dro

Scared money don't make no money {*4X*}

[Smooth B]
It's Smooth B, I be the same rooster
I get mad if my pockets ain't fat like they used to
be, money ain't G-O-D
So I make it then spend it cause it's easy for me
No fair, never scared, never to be compared
to other MC's we drop too many degrees
Please, now I'm gonna show you how the East was won
Weight on my back, of six sextillion tons
Don't forget, 21 seconds, when we gettin fast money
Hold yo' head, don't get hyper, get money, get money

[uncredited singer]
Scared money, don't make no money {*4X w/ ad libs*}
