[Chorus]
Crushed in space, pushed through time
Movin' cautious, obey all signs
Warnin' lights, they flash and blind
Make a statement, but don't define
See I'm on it, make you want it
You ain't on it, don't condone it
Don't you keep from tryin' to clone it
Deep down inside you want it

[Verse One: Coffee]
Whatchu want, whatchu got
How you deal with it?
And you get, whatchu got
Gotta live with it
In the spot and its hot
Gettin' real with it
Don't you know that beneath this flow
Lies scorn, shameful past form
Many regrets like the day I was born
Told myself I'd be reformed
First put to death take time to mourn
Be the ace in ah folded hand
Stare in the face of a scolded man
Come up missin' on the back of a soda can
Go out like only no soldier can
Sermons blazin' through the dark
I'm a prince in the Pazy Park
through the sense, I really play my part
Took my time before I got my start
Now the harvest right
For a brother like me, who the artist type
Who love the culture, through all the hype
Hits and strike, my kiss is deadly, and it be like-

[Chorus]
Crushed in space, pushed through time
Movin' cautious, obey all signs
Warnin' lights, they flash and blind
Make a statement, but don't define
See I'm on it, make you want it
You ain't on it, don't condone it
Don't you keep from tryin' to clone it
Deep down inside you want it

[Verse Two: Bonifide]
Get up, on it!
Don't you clone it
Deep down inside you want it
These boys have cut the fool
These boys from the south got nothing to lose
On a Pettidee track can't help but move
When Grits spit quick fire ain't nothing' but truth
When you come down to it, ain't about the loot
Gotta take you down through it when I'm in the mood
Gotta face the fame, hate that change
Rearrange and break that chain
Let us take you beyond the your reign
Let us show you what you became
That's the goal
Get it in your soul
Shape and mold
And make new from old
Your worth is more, than you've been told
Ya'll kings and queens not pimps and hoes
This that real, this that straw
That break your back and can't shake it off
Exclusive round all inclusive
That heart to find if you lose it

[Chorus]
Crushed in space, pushed through time
Movin' cautious, obey all signs
Warnin' lights, they flash and blind
Make a statement, but don't define
See I'm on it, make you want it
You ain't on it, don't condone it
Don't you keep from tryin' to clone it
Deep down inside you want it
Crushed in space, pushed through time
Movin' cautious, obey all signs
Warnin' lights, they flash and blind
Make a statement, but don't define
See I'm on it, make you want it
You ain't on it, don't condone it
Don't you keep from tryin' to clone it
Deep down inside you want it

Crushed in space, pushed through time
Movin' cautious, obey all signs
Warnin' lights, they flash and blind
Make a statement, but don't define
See I'm on it, make you want it
You ain't on it, don't condone it
Don't you keep from tryin' to clone it
Deep down inside you want it</pre>
