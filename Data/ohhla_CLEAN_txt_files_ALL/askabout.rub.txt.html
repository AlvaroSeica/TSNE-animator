Song:   Ask About Me
Typed by: Cno Evil

[Chorus: Rubbabandz]
Ya'll must crazy, thinking that ya'll can fuck with me
Ya'll niggas ice cold and I'm so hot on these streets
Somebody better ask about me, cuz Bandz name hold weight
I'm pressed for paper, I might run up in your gate

[Rubbabandz]
I'm from Stapleton Projects, 27 Warrant Street
Can't walk to the store without the heat
Get caught slipping, dust heads'll bust head
So don't sleep, it's like Night of the Living Dead
Them young bucks is wild as fuck
They run around with they guns tuck, ready to bust
For UFO's try to fly around here
Unidentified objects get shot out the air
And Rubbabandz underground rapper of the year
And Irv Gotti tried to holla at me, I ain't fuck with him
Bandz ain't the type to jump on the bandwagon
I'd rather lay my own ground work and make it happen
While ya'll clown niggas jump on dicks and ride
I'mma ride my own dick and blow G.M.I.
And I don't care who a nigga thought he was
Cuz when Bandz finish with his ass, he washed up

[Chorus]

[Hook: Rubbabandz]
Give me that work, nigga, give me the cash
Give me that work, nigga, give me the cash
Give me that work, nigga, give me the cash
Give me that work, nigga, give me the cash

[Rubbabandz]
Run up in the spot, with a black ski mask
Lay niggas down on the ground with a stash
Ya'll bitches better comply or get blast
I ain't a gay nigga, but I shot him in the ass
Ya'll little fuckers better fork it over
Or need Lil' Flip and a four leaf clover
And won't stop til my money long like Oprah's
Bandz shine, Toucan Sam and Fruit Roll-Ups
My diamonds glow rainbows
That attract every color type of hoe
I got bitches up north, bitches down south
My good girl that don't even come out the house
My hood bitch set niggas up I rob
I got my gun in his face, he got his dick in the jaw</pre>
