Song:   Rewind
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus: Kam Parker]
When I rewind, replay
All the things that made me
Who I am
Today
The good and the bad
The good and the bad
When I rewind
When I rewind
When I rewind
When I rewind

[Verse 1: Andy Mineo]
I grew up in that Cuse
315, shawty that's my roots
Northside, ridin' with my crew
Northside, ridin' with my crew
Before I had the red lens with the beat in it
Had the mosh bike, I hit the streets with it
Ride anywhere, I go deep with it
Had pegs for shawty when we visit
That's the backseat
Man, I feel like last week
My first rhyme at a rap beat
It was Wu-Tang! Victory!
Rapping been my passion
Since my best friend got that cool edit
Layed vocals on that computer mic
With a E-machine, became a fool with it
Took two-hunned from Christmas
Made myself a wishlist, build a studio
That's my mission, I ain't quitting till it's finished
Studio time, too much to buy
So instead, I "D-I-Y"ed it
All them clothes came out my closet
Cuz' my mic had to go inside
Yeah, if there's a way then you know I find it
Passion drove me to go all night and I lost sleep
But I know I'll find it when I'm six deep and it go all silent
I don't know where I'm going but I'm driven
I got fuel for the journey, let me start at the beginning
Boy!

[Chorus: Kam Parker]
When I rewind, replay
All the things that made me
Who I am
Today
The good and the bad
The good and the bad
When I rewind
When I rewind
Everything I'm not, made me everything I am
When I rewind
When I rewind
Everything I'm not, made me everything I am

[Verse 2: Andy Mineo]
I
Moved down to Manhattan after High School for this rapping
I had plans to make it happen
With my passion and this talent
So I went to CCNY
I got rejected on the first try
For the program that I aim for
Could have gave up but I said âgive me some moreâ
I was so far from home, and everything that I've known
But I got grown in that time alone, and my faith became my own
I was heading out to Queens to see my favorite rapper
Ambassador
I gave him a CD, hope he call me after
He took my bible and he autographed it, bro
Represent him well, [?]
Now I write the same thing when I'm signing
That's rewinding
Even though he never called me back
4 years later I was on his track
I got no time for DJ official
Now look at the tours I played with you, uh
That's insane, just a few years, everything changed
Now I'm on planes
Going out playing for kids that were just like me
And they [?] like me
Trying to make everybody hear they stuff, like me
Probably hearing people tell em shut up, like me
But this ain't about me
Look what God did, no matter what I be

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Kam Parker]
People think we're different
We're all the same
I got a little drama in my life, you got a little drama in yours
What you do with it, it's your choice
Cause I'm looking at my past through the rear view mirror
Thanking God I made it through
I said I'm looking at my past in the rear view mirror
Look at that
Look at that

[Chorus]</pre>
