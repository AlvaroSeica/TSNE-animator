Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
Woke up and I feel just like a billion bucks [x3]
They gone hate with me don't give a billion fucks [x3]
I'm in VIP I'm with a billion sluts [x3]
Everyday I feel just like a billion bucks [x3]

[Jarren Benton]
Uno, dou, tres, leggo
Y'all sucka ass niggas soft like jello
Pull up in the transam nose on the whole gram of the white girl nigga jay oh fellow
Kick a nigga dope for the K-I-l-o
Blunt full of kush make a nigga feel mellow
Sianara to the bad guy to the 45 in the AK mutha fucka say hello
Hello, hi, me I'm high, mesmerized by neon lights
Bitch you know I throw off doctor said I'm not right
Got a white bitch but shes not bright
Hit the bitch and blow a nigga for his stickas then imagine what the ho would do for a klondike
Feelin' like a billion
And I'm about to kill again
Hes on his own island bet them niggas think I'm gillagin
No resilience I'll pop a nigga, drop a nigga Heath Ledger ya nigga
LI'mma pop a little pill again
What up to my homie Ned Fresh up out the pin again
I shove a mutha fuckas head right inside the ceiling fan
Leave a pussy nigga shaking in his Timberlands
D-d-d-d stuttering and t-t-t-t-trembling
Wake up feeling like a billion bucks
Bitch get to steppin' if you don't fuck
I need a ho to give me future with the care blowin' in a space ship call the bitch, Aeon Flux
Fall off in the club where the heat don't tuck
This my year y'all be on suck
Gone on that Charlie Sheen that tiger blood bitch we goin' nuts like

[Chorus]

[Rittz]
Ok Jarren, dog I know they scared
When they see me and you together man it's so unfair
Then when we killin these rappers I bet there's no comparin
Not a fan of their music I hate the clothes they wearin
And I'm so embarrassed at the state of my city
Cause everybody rep they hood and I white boy spot
But when they really get the hood
Try and tell em where they from they be lookin at them like boy stop
But not me I'm from the north side
Feeling like a billion
I'm a slum-merican
Hung yourself fillygan, I'm with a resilient
Bitch who let me drill her
Afterward she call me up and say she never wanna chill again
It's true one say my crew untamed the shit true
My black friends
Always rob my white friends
My white friends get drunk and start fighting each other
And when they bloody they be like aw we tight man
And this red light, damn, and this ain't sharp rap, drop that shit on the internet and when I see you
I'm a tuck in my denim where my sock at, cock back and to swing at your jaw smack, man somebody tell him to fall back
The salt of it at just cost it, probably got a weapon in the octagon
I stop you while my Jimmy Scotts is on, what you thought, come on, it's my time man your watch is wrong
I'm gone, I'm on a whole nother playing field, my name is still Buzzing
I'm fuckin up the streets to watch it. Rollin up the Sour D in the Cutlass supreme
Fuckers put a grin in the name of Marcus, took a dream, it was steam and people garbage
It was keen, momma I'm a be me regardless
People talk a lot of shit, 'cause I'm an easy target
Eatin Zani bars n drink at tops, I got them feeling like a billion

[Chorus]

[Jon Connor]
Switched on, Flinstone, make this buzzom his own
You ain't know you grind, but I stay your man
So what you do, peace more. You all niggas real fake, my own nigga's Bill Gates
Killing the industry with the difference a gear make
I'm here for your ear sake, you wanna hear grey
You fucked up your look, I can hear a mirror brake
You make it so basic fall, the stairway to heaven you're in lead to my basement
Based in the fucking basement it's amazing the Matrix that I hazzle keeps save 'em
Hits give 'em the consake, won't cite, I'm a psycho when I write like a riffle
Took out on my write ons, I swear that I blast every track man on the Bible
Back on, H squad, I came in the hood, nigga, just like y'all
Love I stand on my own two feet, but the haters they pray that I just might fall
No, never there, I drop classics, nigga, give me that
See how my name buzz on the internet, if it's me against the world than I'm winning that
See? Look, my niggas trouble like five in the bank, you bullshiting like five in the tank
See, I grind for mine, I earn my shots so why ain't got another nigga to thank
More, please, get me gang at a young age, say niggas only reviews on the front page
And I know that's true, so you leave me in my eyes and do what you gotta do to make sure that's you</pre>
