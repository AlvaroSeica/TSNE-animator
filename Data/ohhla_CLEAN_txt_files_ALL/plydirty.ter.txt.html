[Termanology]
It's the guard I'm focused, I'm one of the hardest flowers
I open your heart with pokers and cover your car with roses
I'm one of the last poets, to science and math knower's
Combined with my clash flow, its a crime that I'm past over
I roll with the hardest soldiers, stay low when the don approaches
I cover your heart and roast it, and wait on your mamas sofa
I shoot up your daughters stroller, I told you my heart is polar
Unload a barrage of coker and cover up the largest boulders
I'm from the law we known as the hood where they hardly sober
The holster too carry, the toaster is always on the shoulder
I'm out for the pot of gold, if you trip, leave body frozen
And I zip up you mighty goons, in the river your body goes
Don't make use the razor to show you my fruits of labor
Not even your crew could save you, you get in the booth I slay you
Kicked out a housing, for flipping and wilding
And its the Puerto-rican kid with the guns that look Italian

[Lil' Fame]
Man hand me my motherfucking strap, fall back
I'm bout to run up on these niggas like OG wax
And get it popping with my weapon in palm
I am the rawest footage you ever seen since the death of Saddam (come on)
I still do it jumbo, still gun hold, my flows will take ya to the gun show
Front row, ya I know, I should have been out.
They asked me to slim down, tell them bitches kick rocks
Big niggas is in now, marksmen regime and I'm down for the wig out
Kids starve the fuck out, welcome to the rough house
Yellow bust status since special ed had it made
Start a mosh pit, stampede barricade
Cut to you the saga, the saga of the ville
Fuck niggas heads up like the barber of the ville
Mo P to the death, still 7:30, and I keep my hands dirty, cause I play dirty nigga!

[Chorus]
I'm on that old paper chase till the day that I blow
My hands stay dirty cause I play dirty
Fizzyology, My hands stay dirty cause I play dirty
I'm on that old paper chase till the day that I blow
My hands stay dirty cause I play dirty, hands stay dirty
Fizzyology, My hands stay dirty cause I play dirty, Ghost!

[Styles P]
Only time my gun show off is when my gun go off
Fuck around and get your tongue blown off
Get shot from point blank lil nigga the joint stank
Kush and cookies in a big barrel you looking in it
Room full of niggas, I figured you was the pussy in it
I was dead right, this is lead life, raised on the block
I was trained to shoot at your head right
Handling left handed, 2 guns up, no one is left standing
And I caught a back bullets like the next man'n
Or true greeze, you motherfucker could you please
Come off the money, in a jews or get your food freezed
And ate later, I look forward to my 9s like and 8th grader
Love is love, hate later
Cause I'm busy doing ghost shit
P butter I toast shit

[Busta Rhymes]
When I step in the building, niggas often display a behavior that's defensive
I ain't interested in victims, I victimize the collective
If you look from my perspective, and handling situations (brrrrat)
Eliminate every type of retaliation, despite your imagination
And in light of being funny
I beat your bones broke with a bag of bricks full of money, what?
Derek Lam mansions, many ferarri flavors
With humans of property, on top of mountains as my neighbors
Until the fruit basket rapping ass niggas do disappear
I'm eating with reps from Microsoft negotiating shares
On a private plane palace drinking Starbucks in the leer
I'm on a private plane styling getting washed up in the rear
By 2 twin Dominicans while the pilots rip up the throttle
They fuss a little bit about who gon polish the nozzle
Burial, I'm on my everything I wear black shit
While I come too eat your food while my niggas came hear too clack shit!

[Chorus]
My hands stay dirty cause I play dirty,
Fizzyology , My hands stay dirty cause I play dirty
I'm on that old paper chase till the day that I blow
My hands stay dirty cause I play dirty
Fizzyology, My hands stay dirty cause I play dirty</pre>
