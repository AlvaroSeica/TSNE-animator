[Intro] [Kaos]
Yo, check it out. Uh, yeah. South side nigga. What. All my live niggas
What. All my live niggas. All my live niggas. Yo, yo yo

[Chorus] 
Launch a shot
Whether it's on or not
Guard your block
Beef then storm the spot
Alarm the cops
Stick you then pawn your watch
No fake shit, real MC's born to rock

[Verse One]
Oh God, I get charged out of nowhere
Battlin' me is like Afghanistan, nobody want to go there
Especially when I'm charged off the cannibus toke
Puff the dutch too much, lungs damaged with smoke
You can front on the lyrics but you know they sound strong
I walk down the blocks these bitch niggas ain't found on
Diss me, get clowned on
That's how it happen
I bomb shit, no nonsense, my style of rappin'
So vicious
Perfect, flawless, no glitches
And after the show, I'm shacked up with yo mistress
Yo bitches!
I'm runnin' game heavily
To broads I'm Barry Bonds, I'm tryin' to hit 70
Memo came to me with the hot track
Said, "I heard you rock phat."
Asked for dope lyrics, shit I got that
Hardcore, fly the Condor
Who want war?
Impress the crowd and make 'em scream "Encore" 
Niggas

[Chorus] 
Launch a shot
Whether it's on or not
Guard your block
Beef then storm the spot
Alarm the cops
Stick you then pawn your watch
No fake shit, real MC's born to rock

[Verse Two]
Y'all niggas talkin' bout the street life but really couldn't live it
Watch your back punk, you might catch bullets in it
These cats pussy like Monistat, bomb your rap
Your album's faker than Michael Jackson's skin, I can't honor that
The hungriest
Technique like the drunken fist
Lyrical cunningness, all haters can suck a dick
I ain't adjust shit holmes, I beg your pardon
Don't address the Sargent, I bring death like The Headless Horseman
Raw rhymes like P, I'm Bout that
Me without skills, like the ghetto without crack
How's about that
I just snap like bra straps
Test me, I hunger for blood
Get your jaw tapped
Who dares to try to master 
Walkin' fire hazard 
Natural disaster
Blast ya
To you nerd fucks who think you mastered the art
Go back to The Yellow Brick Road and get you some heart
Plus lyrically, or on the street, you don't want the ruckus
I rain/reign on Tin Man MC's and leave them rusted
Metaphor forever raw, lyrical predator
Go to war like He-Man and Skeletor
And fuck wack, cause dope is all I settle for
I play the rap game until I get a better score
And right now my niggas lookin' like a blow out
Grab the mic and show out never hold out
No doubt

[Chorus] [x2]
Launch a shot
Whether it's on or not
Guard your block
Beef then storm the spot
Alarm the cops
Stick you then pawn your watch
No fake shit, real MC's born to rock

[Verse Three]
I've been in this shit since Rakim was Fiendin' for Mics
When gold chains was the shit, nobody's thinkin' of ice
When the music bang hard, no debatin' it's soul
Then the labels got shiest and took creative control
Now we got senior rappers
Low and behold
Gettin' rich off lies and borrowed flows
Can't record and snap
But I'm advanced like a cordless lamp
I make your crew look inferior with a chorus chant
So who want it?
I make the Earth lose orbit
Chicago talk shit and lose you life for it

[Chorus] [x2]
Launch a shot
Whether it's on or not
Guard your block
Beef then storm the spot
Alarm the cops
Stick you then pawn your watch
No fake shit, real MC's born to rock</pre>
