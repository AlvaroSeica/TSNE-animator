[Jay-Z]
How we do
Yo
All of my rhymes fall - all of my days I trade
all of my dimes and all of my bad ways I fade
killing late nights cruisin'
all you see is the break lights
and hair blowing you know where we going
or at the club in the rear frontin'
poppin droppin'
the amounts of cats but we aint trying to hear nothing
probably was wilder than wobbly are you the wiggy to give me
hold me down and make me slow down to be twissy
keep the ice out the club life - change face
get on love wife while he on the license plates
wait - make me think about you even when your not around
use the bathroom put the toilet seat back down
got me some sprinkles the hair with the wrinkles
if preferred his and her furs to the ankles
keep your friends buggin' lovin' all my ways
Jigga keep me jiggy all of my days

[Changing Faces]
in the middle of the night
got me thinkin' bout cha babe
got me dreamin' about cha baby

[Chorus]
all that I have
all that I have
baby it's yours
baby it's yours forever and ever baby
all I want is to be with you all of my days
all I want all I need
all I want is to be with you all of my days
all I want baby

[Changing Faces]
anything that turn you on
i'll be givin' it to you babe
you dont have to worry baby

[Chorus]

[Jay-Z]
yeah ha ha - check it

[R. Kelly]
all I want - all I need
is you in my life - loving me
all I want - all I need
is you in my life

[Jay-Z]
uh huh

[R. Kelly]
loving me

[Jay-Z]
now we going house shoppin'
everybody want to know the prices of spouse droppin'
keep it on the low R Kelly style it's quite shockin'
a year ago all I did was spend nights hoppin'
in the club in search of pretty faces and night stalkers
who would have thought i'd walk down the aisle
rice droppin' got you a nice rock and ...
now it's on and poppin' droppin' holiday platinum bracelets
Jigga - R Kelly - Changing Faces
Uh

[Chorus] - 2X to fade</pre>
