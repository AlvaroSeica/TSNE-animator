[Intro]
Mic check, mic check

[Verse 1]
I go in on an ocean
Speaking with this beacon throughout his teachings
He showing me devotion
He serve flows in this poetry emotion
If I get too deep, pardon me
I'm just going through the motions
Just stay in the flow, boat in the ocean
My pain big as migraines for a multrant
I come from a full house like the Olsen twins
Early 90's, lot of crack back then
Turn my father evil, never been in the private house
The only addicts I knew was real people
And the streets is nothing sweet but we equal
Gotta understand, it's nothing sweet, but we equal
Fuck the grind, these haters poppin to kill you
I'm colorblind, I know that green paper with the eagle
And through the sins, the lord's gonna forgive them
Thanks for the gift of life, I'm a keep the ribbon

[Chorus]
Not a coincidence
If I know that I got the chance
But what is that was always meant
Is a ribbon

[Verse 2]
You could tell by the crowd I'm great, certain style I make
Came from 3 vowels now I reevaluate
With this gift of life, I'm superman, no kryptonite
And I blew, I could be your creep tonight
Analyzing what lies just right in front of us
And realize there ain't going side with none of us
Meaning the government
I know this kid fault parents got killed
He aksing me where his mother went
Man life is so precious
I pray my daughter and godson get they extras
Meaning more, even though I spit this raw
I still got simmilar problems that's for a Tim McGraw
We all grown men, was once kings before
Understand there's nothing I never seen before
Know the law gonn forgive em
But thanks for the gift of life, I got the ribbon

[Chorus]
Not a coincidence
If I know that I got the chance
But what is that was always meant
Is a ribbon</pre>
