Typed by: Nickolye16@aol.com 

[Intro: J. Cole]
She knows
She knows, hey

[Interlude: sample of "Bad Things" performed by Cults]
Bad things happen to the people you love
And you find yourself praying up to Heaven above
But honestly I've never had much sympathy
Cause those bad things, I always saw them coming for me
I'm gonna run run away, run run away, run away
Run away and never come back
Run run away, run run away, run away
Show 'em that your color is black

[J. Cole]
Oh I, oh I-I-I
Well alright, oh I, oh I-I-I
Well alright

Damned if I do, damned if I don't
You know I got a girl back home, you got a man what you want, what you want?
+What These Bitches Want+ from a nigga? On some DMX shit
I know them other niggaz love trickin, on some BMX shit
But not me, now I'm sure you done heard 'bout me
A +Black Star+, Mos Def, Kweli
Good so them bad hoes try me, they try me
This is Martin Luther King in the club, gettin dubs
With a bad bitch in his ear sayin that she down for whatever
In the back of his mind is Coretta

[Chorus One: J. Cole]
And she knows, she knows
And I know she knows, and I know she knows
And deep down she knows, she knows
And I know she knows, and I know she knows

[Chorus Two: J. Cole + Amber Coffman]
Well alright, oh I, oh I-I-I
I can't be what you want from me
Well alright, oh I, oh I-I-I
I can't be what you want from me
Well alright

[Interlude] - during both Choruses

[J. Cole]
Damned if I do (shit) damned if I don't
I'm passin up on bad hoes, tryin to be the man that she want, what she want?
What, what she want from a nigga? To put a ring on it
Got a bitch on my dick right now, and she just wanna sing on it
Got me up so high, tryin to get a piece of that apple pie
I be up so high, tryin to get a piece of that apple pie
Dancehall vibe with my pants on fire cause I told her I was sleep
As I creep with this pretty young thing that I chose
And she could be doin the same thing I suppose

[Chorus One] + [Chorus Two]

[Interlude] - during both Choruses

[J. Cole]
A nigga say turn up, hoes say turn up
Only bad thing 'bout a star is they burn up
Niggaz say turn up, hoes say turn up
Only bad thing 'bout a star is they burn up
Rest in peace to Aaliyah
Rest in peace to Left Eye (Left Eye)
Michael Jackson I'll see ya
Just as soon as I die (I die)
Got me up so high, tryin to get a piece of that apple pie
I be up so high, tryin to get a piece of that apple pie
Got me up so high, tryin to get a piece of that apple pie
I be up so high, tryin to get a piece of that apple pie

[Chorus Two]

[Interlude] - latter half during Chorus Two

{*instrumental for 31 seconds*}

[Outro: Amber Coffman - repeat 4X]
Runaway, runaway, faaaaaast
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
