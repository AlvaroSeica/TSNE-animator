[Chorus]
Shine, shine, shine
Everyday when I'm rollin through the hood
Playas watch me cos they know I
"Shine, shine, shine"
Hey! I know I'm shinin, a fresh pair of whities and a crispy T on
Love to hate me cos you know I'm gonna
"Shine, shine, shine"

[Female Singer]
Keep doin what you doin
It's ya time and its ya shine
I love the way you ride
I hope you shine
The party starts tonight
My friends are comin over
I really think you fly
Tonight's the night
"shine shine shine"

[Verse 1 - Snoop Dogg]
I shine like Neptune, Venus, and Mars in yo face in yo state
In and out of cars, in a state, with a date with one of my broads
But you gotta leave that bitch before she gets your dick hard
Thats what shinin about and when you get the hoe
You can tear her linin out, what you whinin about?
You in the presence of pimpin, I'm walkin while limpin
And holdin on the drink that I'm sippin, I'm flippin the script and
Im slidin while I'm dippin my whip in, out-of-traffic
Its so drastic, boombastic, this shits a hit, Jadakiss
matter fact nephew, this bitch is a classic
pass this ayo locy loc' let's blow some dope
better yet lets go for dough, hoe for hoe
I'm so fa sho, and so low and sensational
You know how I do it

[Chorus]
Shine, shine, shine
Everyday when I'm rollin thru the hood
Playas watch me cuz they know I
"Shine, shine, shine"
Hey I know I'm shinin, a fresh pair of whities and a crispy T on
Love to hate me cuz you know I'm gonna
"Shine, shine, shine"

[Female Singer]
Keep doin what you doin
Its ya time and its ya shine
I love the way you ride
I hope you shine "shine shine shine"
The party starts tonight
My friends are comin over
I really think you fly
Tonight'sthe night
"shine shine shine"

[Verse 2 - DJ Quik]
Now whats the haps on the bottle cap, I want a snow bunny
"I'm Rick James bitch!" I got the show money
and I ain't hatin for nothin, but it be so funny
how cowards be wantin see me with my eyes and nose runny
I got nouns and verbs while you got pounds of curbs
and one of us got a place if we around the burbs
I'm fittin like a lego block, you bullshittin while I'm sittin
in an eight-o-drop, these suckaz tell me "keep it gangsta"
But they don't know, when they ain't lookin I be hearin population control
Then I'm lookin for a breezy with a whole lotta soul
so I can have a malfunction in my wardrobe
SIP! not the Jada with the smith
It's the Jada with the fo' fifth, clutchin on the fifth
With Snoop be in the front and his jewelry shinin
all through his clothes and lil niggaz in the back on the low...
but I still shine though!

[Chorus]
Shine, shine, shine
Everyday when I'm rollin thru the hood
Playas watch me cuz they know I
"Shine, shine, shine"
Hey I know I'm shinin, a fresh pair of whities and a crispy T on
Love to hate me cuz you know I'm gonna
"Shine, shine, shine"

[Female Singer]
Keep doin what you doin
It's ya time and its ya shine
I love the way you ride
I hope you shine "shine shine shine"
The party starts tonight
My friends are comin over
I really think you fly
Tonight'sthe night
"shine shine shine"


[Verse 3 - Jadakiss]
UH, Like a African diamond its deeper than rappin and rhymin
Success happens with timin, over here I'm doin low with the punk
When I'm over there I'm on the low low with my unc
and all the bitches lookin for us
But I ain't lookin for puss, right now ma' I'm lookin for cush
And I'm strapped with the pound and house shoes, Khakis, T shirts
Ah Uh ! Thats my surroundings, air force ones, jeans City
lab a-fitted thats when I'm back in the town
Don't get it confused I'm proud to be gone
be home in a year with duffle bags out on the lawn
So much money my niggaz keep countin it wrong
So many hits I cant keep count of the songs
and we still grindin, stainless still nine
And y'all still hate but we still shinin lets go!

[Chorus]
Shine, shine, shine
Everyday when I'm rollin through the hood
Playas watch me cuz they know I
"Shine, shine, shine"
Hey I know I'm shinin, afresh pair of whities with a crispy T on
Love to hate me cuz you know I'm gonna
"Shine, shine, shine"

[Female Singer]
Keep doin what you doin
It's ya time and its ya shine
I love the way you ride
I hope you shine "Shine shine shine"
The party starts tonight
My friends are comin over
I really think you fly
Tonight'sthe night
"Shine, shine, shine"</pre>
