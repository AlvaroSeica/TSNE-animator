Lights is getting dimmer, nights getting colder
Lost three of my soldiers, life feel like its over
Unloading its something in my way,there's something in my way
They'll never take me alive I got something on the way
Ima survive, Ima try to do straight
Try to make it alive, be around for that due date
But its hard, niggaz hattin him hard
That lost hurt to the heart, but still they say its they fault
We blame y'all, nigga how nigga please
Its still on baby, tell them niggaz have they still off safety
What about them other fake dudes that he grew up with
Elementary, Middle school up with
Man them niggaz was there ain't move yet
I'm starting to think they had something to do with it
I use to think them niggaz was scared, its looking a little shaky now
Them niggaz happpy, his lil brother snappin his mother hatting me now(damn)

[Chorus]
I know it hurt somedays
Isn't this the game we chose to play
Now that everything in life ain't gold
But it will be ok
Afterwards a bullet ain't got no aim
And y'all know bullets ain't got no name
But this is the life we chose
And it will never change

[Neef]
Every night we reminisce about that three day trip
Same night that we left got a call, you hit
Thought you was still with us, ain't no need that we flip
Got a call from aunt peaches found out where you was hit
Three hit him, several missed him, and you just a couple inches
you don't know how much we miss him bullshitting in the kitchen
ninety percent fiss fights leading to them slammers
But lil Dre can't understand until' one of them niggaz vanished
This rap shit is crazy, but believe me Ima try
Whether happen or not homie I got lil Five
And with the real ones Ima slice my pies,as you would have wanted
Man I'm so sick to my stomach
That you ain't around to join the fruits of our labor
Shits about to get major, and these niggaz really hate us
Around for nothing giving me teeth and palm
But I don't pay them no mind just try to focus and rhyme(Ya know)

[Chorus]

[Chris]
Aunt peaches thats where you can reach us
Cook out every other, til they took a nigga brother
Love you like a brother, so I try to take you brother in
He be on some other shit,I be tryna tell him man, I see how you feel
He had intentions on killing my big brother just to let me see how he feel
Telling me his life over fuck it, cops know
They after him, before they catch him he got people to kill
That boy crazy he got people for real
He gone wound up laying somewhere peaceful forreal
Like he the only one going through the pain
Like his momma and aunt peaches ain't going throught the same
Cool one minute, then he going through a change
I don't need that around, keep the heaters around
Just like the rest of them niggaz that I leave int the town
So I seperate myself, I live better with myself

[chorus: 2x] </pre>
