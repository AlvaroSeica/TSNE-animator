[ VERSE 1 ]
How many of you heard about snakes
The kind that bite you if you're not awake
Not the reptile, the cold bloody wild
Walkin, talkin with the human lifestyle
The kind that lie, cheat, and do wrong
Cause destruction, and then they're gone
Without any trace they vacate the place
Some look pretty with an innocent face
You never know the negativity they are in
You try to identify, and they shed skin
The most-wrong-doin, the-truth-consealin
The unditected, ever-so-appealin

(Snakes) original (snakes) grafted (snakes)
A snake is a snake
Cause they're phony and fake
Devious (snakes) the wicked (snakes)
One to the head, for goodness sake

[ VERSE 2 ]
Somebody was flakin, snakin, and mistakin
And when I find out, I'm bound to start breakin
One for the head when I find who said
I was the one who got caught and dropped dime on Red
Cause you got the fellas mad as can be
Money, I'ma get you before they get me
See, I'm not the rat who bites the cheese
Cause I can do a three year's bid with ease
Please, you heard wrong from what I know
Because I wasn't even caught by five-o
Now who would assume Sunborn is a rat?
The same one who said I wasn't right 'n exact
For you are the one, you let your tongue run loose
You try to set me up, so you can have my juice
My name is seven letters, my shoes are too big
It's burrial time, and you will help me dig
Your grave, now be brave, there's no time to waste
The snake is the one who I shot in the face
(Hey Sun, how do you know you didn't make mistakes?)
He denied before I asked him, so he was the fake flake

(Snakes) the black (snakes) the white (snakes) 
A snake is a snake, so you make no mistake
Devilish (snakes) the venomous (snakes)
Once you are bitten, that's all it takes

[ VERSE 3 ]
One of my girls found out about the other one
I just killed a snake, now I gotta kill another one
Could haven been a male or female who told
My girl they seen another girl wearin my gold
Now she knows everything that I don't even know
She gave me a list of every place we go
Together, I say 'whatever', it can't be denied
Just because I never told, doesn't mean I lied
Now I gotta 'fess up and tell the truth
She even knows about the phone calls at the phone booth
Damn, who's the little fork-tongued critter?
Who told her I knocked the boots of the baby sitter
She won't say who she heard quotin
Just keep talkin while my gun is bein loaded
It might be a friend who's really a foe
But say no more, love, I think I know
Who the culprit is, you canivin swine
Can't be me, so you wanna have mine
Guess who is guilty of such perpetration
The one who I gave all the wrong information

(Snakes) original (snakes) the grafted (snakes)
A snake is a snake
Cause they're phony and fake
Devious (snakes) the wicked (snakes)
And once you are bitten, that's all it takes

[ VERSE 4 ]
The city streets are full of deceit
The same negativity must repeat
It's goin on and on, and not about to stop
Snakes are criminals, snakes are cops
Out even in the White House, without a doubt
Find a snake, and let's cast them out
Slippin, slidin, duckin, hidin
Buy a new car and go snake-ridin
I guess now you snakes are very angry
Cause I'm black, white, you wanna hang me
I see the ropes, and I'm no dope
I was taught to cope
Can you fool me? Nope

(Snakes) the fork-tongued (snakes) the belly-crawlin (snakes)
Thought I was sleepin, found out I was awake
Lyin (snakes) the devious (snakes)
The heat is too hot, so it's time that you break

Weaken the weak
Is the snake technique  (4x)

(Two times)
(Hit me)

Peace to Allah's Nation
I'd like to say peace to my man Carlos doin a little bid right now
You gonna handle that, bee
I'd like to say peace to my man Tafari 
rulin in-a New Jersey style Seen?
Have to watch out for snakes in-a di area...</pre>
