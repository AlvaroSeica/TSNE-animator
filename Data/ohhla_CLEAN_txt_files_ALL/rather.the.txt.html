Ya boy ya know what they call the boy

[3rd Verse: Keak Da Sneak]
Farm Boys YAYUH!
All in the do'
If you ain't heard the words
Act Like You Know
I was roundin around snow through the summa' and the winta'
Hittin that ass like a slug pop glock breakin the inna
eatin niggaz fa dinna take suckas food
Right now I'm on the urge but really I ain't cool
Its that What you know about how do you surrenda
Inhalin niggaz M-brake like Rarararararomm
Fifteen on a theft scene
Tell her shit man boom me on them jeans
Gettin things like yamean
fifty the yacky dyke
Fore I even had starve
Best Believe I'll be stabbin ya
Crackin ya grabbin ya
But I think I went off
Get off my calls cause ain't no room
For Your M.I. Draws
I rip wind pause then fast forward
Stop Eject Gone Before You Knew It
But

[Chorus]</pre>
