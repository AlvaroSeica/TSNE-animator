(*talking*)
C.M.G. is the click, fuck with us man
We'll murder niggaz for real, out here on these streets
Brah, believe that

[Hook]
Cock back, my niggaz and shoot first
Cock back, my niggaz and shoot first
Cock back, my niggaz and shoot first
Fuck with my click, and your dick in the dirt
Cock back, my niggaz and shoot first
Cock back, my niggaz and shoot first
Cock back, my niggaz and shoot first
C.M.G., like to hit em where it hurt

[Lil' Keke]
We got a army, my click off the meat rack
Manny's got the M-5-7, and he packing
Don got four bank accounts, and he stacking
C.M.G. the click, in a whole 'nother bracket
Niggaz play both sides, I smell the serpent
But I watched over dirt, cause my skill detergent
But I'm in the fourth quarter, and my time is urgent
And I bust off fo' shots, just to see if it's working
Then I, cock back my niggaz and let loose
Bust bitch niggaz in the streets, they call truse
But I chunk up the deuce, the ghetto love me dog
And I still got niggaz, that's behind the wall yeah

[Hook]

[Lil' Keke]
If I blaze up my gun, that's when they start to run
Southside Young Don, stands second to none
If my heat cocked back, then I shoot pronto
Till it click-click, click ain't no mo'
Cause I'm strapped at the show, like Desperado
And I will shoot a bitch, in her pinky toe
If I hit a nigga high, then I shoot back low
I know killers in the grave, got some on death row
I kill a nigga safe, like a gattling pro
With them cutthroat boys, that'll rape your hoe
And my oven on safety, when the block is slow
And I'm up getting mine, 'fore the roosters crow
Niggaz out there hating, man fuck that do'
I be damned if I get killed, behind some snow
Whoa, desert eagle knock a dick in the dirt
And I'll split a nigga wig mayn, behind some work yeah

[Hook]

[Lil' Keke]
I'ma load up the K, and try to ruin your day
I got infrared scopes, that automatically spray
If these niggaz play froggy, like they just don't bar
There's another casualty, up in Keke's war
Got a killer upstate, with a two life sentence
And to prove C.M.G., still down with a vengeance
Plus Jesus lets me, give my soul repentance
Cause I'm up with nightmares, about gates and fences
It's a long way home, when you dressed in white
So I picked up my pen, and started biting the mic
I'm a fool with my game, and it's virgin tight
And I shock with my pen, till I see the light
If you reach for your hip man, you dying tonight
Reservation check out, for your paradise
Yeah snitch niggaz fold, cause they rats and mice
But you can get a toe-tag, on a block of ice

[Hook]

(*talking*)
Cock back, my niggaz and shoot first
Cock back, my niggaz and shoot first
Cock back, my niggaz and shoot first
Fuck with Don Ke', and you can die in a verse
Cock back, my niggaz and shoot first
Cock back, my niggaz and shoot first
Cock back, my niggaz and shoot first
Cock back, my niggaz and shoot first
Fuck with C.M.G., and your life get worse ha</pre>
