Song:   Stop Cuf'n These Hoes
Typed by: Lil Hustle

[Hook: Billy Cook]
I ain't cuffing no hoes, I'm married to the streets
Ain't no time to get mad, plus your bitch chose me
She recognize the game, plus the G in me
See playas get chose, so your bitch chose me

[Billy Cook]
Don't get mad, cause your bitch chose me
Don't get mad, cause your bitch chose me
Don't get mad, cause your bitch chose me
Stop, cuffing these hoes - 2x

[Jay'Ton]
Don't get mad, cause your bitch chose me
Never catch Jay'Ton, cuffing up in these streets
Only niggaz in my slab, riding in the front seat
Can't have the smell of perfume, on my Tall-Tee
I'm a gangsta, I ain't tripping if you let my nigga hit
I'ma call another bitch, and try and see what I can get
Fuck a dime, I refuse to trick and cuff sluts
Hop fly, introducing they feet to these cuts
So swift, and plus I like to ride one deep
Unless I'm with my niggaz flipping, 22's on a Fleet
That's how it is, and that's the way it gotta remain
I'm a nationwide pimp, ain't a damn thang changed

[Hook]

[Boss]
I can't be cuffing these hoes, I know how to fuck em
Then it's off to the load, smoke a cigarette then I'm off to the road
At the shack, with the next bitch
Trying to get this hoe, to buy me this brand new necklace
Running through these hoes reckless, never protectless
I can't put shackles on a bitch, out here in Texas
Niggaz get these dime piece hoes, and lock 'em down
I take one look at these dog ass hoes, and knock 'em down
And keep going, cause I know a hoe gon keep hoe'ing
I'm a gangsta, I can't gal that bitch y'all niggaz knowing
I use to a nigga like you, fucking up my day
I'ma let that bitch suck me up, in my rag Chevrolet

[W.G.]
Nigga please, playas get chosed off top
These niggaz be loving bops, I just stop and watch
I ain't tripping, cause the game I be spitting
Be leaving these hoes sick, like they was bedridden
Stop hating, and learn how to share these hoes
These niggaz be taking classes, on cuffing these hoes
I'm a G, and that's all I got to say
When they see that candy red, they gon mind anyway
Ain't no stopping and blocking, and mind game
Representing for, the Slow Loud and the Bang
Me, Boss, Jay be pimping these dames
Knock 'em down fast, and pass in they lane

[Hook]

[Trae]
I'm a certified pimp, by the way I spit
When I spit I spit it how my flow, my mouthpiece so sick
Got game by the mile, and plus I like to block when I smile
So boppers tend to ride my dick, like I been gone for a while
Cuffing ain't in my vocabulary, I strut like a Don
Run up on me bumping bout a bitch, you might get met with my palm
The only thing I learned to love, around this bitch is my money
When it come to hoes I run up in em, and I leave 'em for dummies
Same rules apply to boppers, as these roach ass niggaz
Take your roach ass and get the fuck on, you ain't touching my figgas
I mean it and I put that on a G, who's stomping in Gators
Don't try to cuff, and it ain't hard to see that I's a playa

[Hook]

[Billy Cook]
Don't get mad, cause your bitch chose me
Don't get mad, cause your bitch chose me
Don't get mad, cause your bitch chose me
Stop, cuffing these hoes - 2x

(*Billy Cook*)
Stop cuffing these hoes, yeeeah
Stop cuffing these hoes, hoe-ha-hoe-ha-hoe
Stop cuffing these hoes
Hoe don't get mad at me, a G</pre>
