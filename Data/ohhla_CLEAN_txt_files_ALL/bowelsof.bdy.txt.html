[Verse One: Ice-T]
Out one night, I was just chilling out with my crew
We were acting wild, cause I didn't have nothing else better to do
Got a nine at my waist, stay out my fucking face
You fuck with me, right here'll be your resting place
Some old sucker, yo, he tried to put a move on me
I shot him in the face, murder in the first degree
Now I'm sweating, regretting, that's not for me
They got me locked in the fucking penitentiary!

[Chorus: Ice-T]
Bowels of the devil
Let me tell you what the motherfucker eats
It's stomach is filled with lost souls
Guts made out of steel and concrete
Bowels of the devil
Listen close cause I've been there before
And you don't wanna die there, they call it going out the back door
The back door, the back door, the back door!!

[Verse Two: Ice-T]
Walked in the club all the whores gave me the sex look
They like a nigga like me cause I'm a known crook
And my posse is down, we don't mess around
You fuck with us, you'll be six feet underground
That night they got me locked in a row called death
The governor; that motherfucker wants my last breath
That's right, homeboy wanted to pull a switch on me
Up here in this fucking penitentiary!

[Chorus: Ice-T with variations]
Bowels of the devil
Let me tell you what that sucker eats
It's stomach is filled with my homeboys
Guts made out of steel and concrete
Bowels of the devil
Listen close cause I've been there before
And you don't wanna die there, they call it going out the back door
The back door, the back door, the back door 
Yeah!
Bowels of the devil
Let me tell you what that sucker eats
It's stomach is filled with my homeboys
Guts made out of steel and concrete
Bowels of the devil
Listen close cause I've been there before
And you don't wanna die there, they call it going out the back door
The back door, the back door, the back door
