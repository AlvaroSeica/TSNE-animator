[Verse 1]
Nukka Saigon where'd you get that FLOW
You better get in there and get that DOUGH
All over the world, god, it's kids that KNOW
You remember in South click we did that SHOW
Only had one mic but ripped that THOUGH
Only had one fight and flipped that MUG
Lucky for him we didn't get that TOUGH
Cuz word to my moms I woulda shit bagged BRO
SAAAMN
Let 'em KNOW
Nukka Saigon where'd you get that FLOW
You ill when you rhyme simple as tic tac TOE
You know why I'm rhymin' as simple as tic tac TOE?
Cuz niggaz is dumb and that's the shit that BLOW
SAAAMN
Let'm KNOW
Nukka Saigon where'd you get that FLOW
Half on the quart, yeah nigga that's WHOA
It's always them same niggaz that sniff that SNOW
Get away with the yay but get that DRO
I wanna get high, nigga, forget that HOE
You can keep that dutch but let that zig zag GO

Told niggaz I was comin'
Saigon
Patna'
I'm the one y'all need to be worred about
Patna'
I'm that dude
Y'all gon' see
Let's get back to business

[Verse 2]
My team will come through; pop you in the head
Them sixteens shot you now you up and dead
You act like you can't get hit with hot lead
I pop you in your cornrows; pop 'em in the dreads
Even niggaz with waves could get some of this
SAAAMN
Come again; got niggaz in the State Pen; niggaz in the bing
Got niggaz only hatin' cuz I'm getting' ripped
Now I got to chase them with the infrared
SAAAMN
Come again; somebody gonna leave this party dead
Some boy gon' get shot and knocked in the head
I hit him with the head shot that rocked him to bed
Sprayed down, popped him, shot him then I fled
SAAAMN
Come again
