[Mr. Lil One]
*Talkin*
Yeah, you know how we do
Lil Uno, and I brought my homie 
Sicc Made
We're gonna break down
To all the bitches
And all the hoes
Here we go
*Rappin*
I got plenty of hoes
Freaky little 20 year olds
Centerfolds, callin on the cellular phone
They pluck, hook it up and get freaky
It's all good girl, where you wanna meet me
She said night life, and bring pornos
Bring your home boys, I got my home girls
Wanna fuck all night and get nasty
Lil One can you please come and spank me
That's affirmative, ten four
Let me come and do you like a nickelbag hore
I love the way you moan every time that we bone
I love the dirty thoughts that you put ip in my dome
I love the way you wiggle every time I'm in the middle
I love the way you fuck when you're fuckin wit the Little
I love the way you keep it on the lo lo
And never let a mothafucka know know

[Chorus: Mr. Lil One]
I love the way you up on your lipstick
Baby can you suck on my big stick
I love the way you lick on your lips
I love the way you move when you strip
[2x]

[Siccmade]
Well it's that lowridin
Young thug Sicc Made
It's a trip man
So many hoes to get play
Mr. Lil put me up on the game
So it's mine time to shine 
For the fortune and fame
And trust me when I shine
Cause I'm always gonna glisten
Wreckin mics in my pad
Spittin out some playalistic
Bitches, I ain't givin up no shorts and no losses
Collectin my cheddar, organize like crime bosses
Your lose is my gain and I still maintain
Got to dykes in the back takin two dicks to the brain
Sounds insane, my thought is that you dispise
Most of the time I'm too high to realize
How trifflin this hoes be
Actin like they knows me
Bitch don't know shit 
Except a smack from the n-u-t
So to say but that's the way it is
In that Diego, California, Biatch

[Chorus]

[Mr. Lil One]
I remember a day
Saturday, TJ
You were all up on a mothafuckin Ese
Wigglin your ass every time that I passed
Givin me some look, like some dick up in your ass
Dance wit the Devil, the level's outrageous
When my niggas slip and my dawg Macadascious
Don't act like you don't know
Cause me and you both, know you're a hoe
So I remain insane
Better watch your mouth when it comes to my name
Game's for the players, but I be a coach
Every where I go bitches givin up the chonch
Askin me Lil' can you come across me
Just like Slide, can you foundle me and floss me
Double cross me, hang, dead
Keep up on your knees and play wit my head

[Chorus]</pre>
