[Intro]
DJ KHALED!

[J. Cole]
And you know it don't stop, grindin 'round that clock
Mastermindin my second album my first album just dropped
Scored a touchdown on my first down niggaz thought I was gon' flop
See I hustle like my momma but I look just like my pops
And we still duckin cops, ride around and take shots
Hennessy for my enemies, niggaz know I'm takin they spot
Cause that score up on the play clock, show just how I came from way back
Just like T-I-P told you +ASAP+ but you niggaz rappin like Aesop
Get a grip - oh that's your dream car? Nigga that's my old whip
Oh that's your dream girl? Nigga that's my old bitch
Oh that's your new flow? Nigga that's my old shit
This that new K.R.I.T. shit, that Cole shit, them country niggaz

[Chorus: Cole]
One for the money, two for the show
Three for them hoes sayin anything goes
They say they ready for whatever!
They say they ready for whatever
I been around the world, twice to be exact
Six bad bitches and they lapped up in the back
They say they ready for whatever!
They say they ready for whatever

[Big K.R.I.T.]
Yo crew
Shorty look what we got, my bass beat and it knock
Got the old school in my old school 'bout to post up on yo' block
Yo broad chose like she was supposed to and you up in arms cause she bopped
Well I hate to say it but I got to say that I wish that they would just stop
So fuck these haters, fuck these hoes that ain't slammin doors on they drop
Y'all niggaz too young to remember how to the south used to be but I'm not
So when it come to snappin Cadillacs, +SpottieOttieDopaliscious+ y'all pop
You thought +Krit Wuz Here+ and +R4+ were the shit, bitch wait 'til my album drop
Say that's yo' new car? Nigga that's my old slab
Say that's yo' new bitch? Nigga that's my old stab
Oh that's yo' new flow? That shit sound so trash
This that new K.R.I.T. shit, that Cole shit, them country niggaz

[Kendrick Lamar]
Hold up.... but don't forget about Compton nigga
One for the money, two for the show
Three for +No Limit+ and the rest for +Death Row+
That means I been +Bout It Bout It+ and this is the realest shit I ever wrote
And if anyone ever doubt it then they are the loudest of liars I know
I only desire to blow, she only desire to blow
and I hope that my dick is a whistlely flute, and that's not the instrumental
Now pick up my coat
You let that motherfucker drag like RuPaul, I'll drag yo' ass to the floor
Bitch I can admit, I'm a recovered addict, paraphernalia that is
Tellin the doctor I'm sick, head doctor I'm needing your lips, yea
Proper analogy for it, if I can afford it then I won't ignore it, yea
Cop me a palace and Porsche and right when I floor it that's when I switched - gears
Living my life on Uranus, uh, keeping one foot in your anus, uh
The other foot all on your neck, repeatedly stomp 'til I break it, uh
Bitch I'm demandin respect, these bitches is tellin me take it
DJ Khaled, even if I had callus, holdin the torch ain't no challenge
Ain't it?

[Chorus]
