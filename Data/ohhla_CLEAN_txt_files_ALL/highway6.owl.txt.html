[Host:]
Tonight I'm standing on highway 666
Running pretends like the Cortez shipwreck

[Mr. Lil One]
Stimulated by the slow track, I think I need to go back
While I consume many ounces of the con'ag
who got your back dog ain't no need to lie
Falsifed the wink in your eye
I remember times when you cryid to me
Put that on your life you never lied to me
Now I'm trying to be just plain old me
Where the fuck did you get the nuts to put smug on me
I'm a chop it up, roll it up and add a little bit of light now
And I'm a tell you where you oughtah be right now
Motherfucker riding on the campaign who got the champagne
Fucking up my last name
I got to rondevous with all of you
So I'm gonna follow you and slaughter you
All of you I'll tell you what you oughta do
Get yourself a 4-5 put that in your mouth
Pull the trigger motherfucker 'til you black out
Here on

[Chorus]
Highway 666, is where we roam
Is where we cripple motherfuckers in their dome
Highway 666, is where we mob
Is where we slaughter motherfuckers and their moms
Highway 666, is where we hang
Is where the evil motherfuckers come and bang
Highway 666, is where we live
Is where we cursed motherfuckers and their kids

[Mr. Shadow]
It's your worst thought, your spot is now taken
I'm tripping off some bomb shit now wait a second
Who's stepping, tripping yapping or disrespecting
All you loud mouth motherfuckers feel the murder weapon
Situations where the average man
Dies with his eyes opened and a gun in his hand
Turn a man into a bitch you will get hit
On highway 666 with broken bottles and sticks
You kicked the bucket, me Knights and Lil say fuck it
Catch you in the shadows of your hood because we love it
S.D. thugg'n Southern Cali maddness
Valley of the damned were horriffic shit happens
Subtracting fools freom your block trick believe me
You'll be a headliner missing like Chandra Levy
Looks can be deceiving so don't judge the cover
You just met the three Mistas motherfucker
Here on

[Chorus]

[Knightowl]
I'm cursed by the spooky shit where blood likes to drip
Where fools like to pack blades with garlic on the tip
Pack a 4-5' smoke fools for the fuck of it
Watch a motherfucker beg shoot him in the fuckin head
Who gives a shit not me, watch them die
The sky be getting let but this ain't the 4th of Kuly
Bitches that will yap take a nap with the sharks
Meet us in the park were it gets crazy after dark
I'll crack your fucking dome shut them eyes like a jap
Snap your fucking spine, you best not fuck with mine
Highway triple six where your life well get stolen
Tush a motherfucker if you feel the nuts swollen
Come and take a chance where the devil likes to dance
Have you ever seen a man piss up in his pants
Cry like a baby chance's Slim just like Shady
The last thing you seen was my fist clutch a 3-80

[Chorus]

Highway 666</pre>
