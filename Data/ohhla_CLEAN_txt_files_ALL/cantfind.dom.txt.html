"That's when I've got to understand..."

[Dom Pachino]
Monopolize, tropical guy who rock it right
Keep his pockets tight, filled wit the dead pres, the weed res'
On my point of fingers, successful, but not a normal nigga
Expressful, I have to warn a nigga, I bomb a nigga
I make the waters splash, when my ships come in
He deserve to pass, my guns talking like we need a blast
Once they get it, yeah, we need it bad, I have to talk to him
Like, but only if we need that, the gemini mind is extra feedback
Leave that alone before the heat at your dome, I don't get paid for this shit
Nigga, only my poems, don't have to make me have to run up in homes
I'm not young no more, the next question
Is you still hardcore, forever, just alot smarter
And a hell of a lot better, and a hell of a lot more cheddar
Let's get this shit together, I rock it in any weather
I ride on all terrain, it don't take rocket science to figure out, man
My shit is off the chain, I 'bring the pain' like Method in his old days
I'm riding with road rage with a "smile on your face"
Remarkable, look at me I'm shining, look at me, I'm shining
Look at me, I'm shining, "living in disgrace"

[Chorus: Dom Pachino]
Look at me grinding, look at me shining
They been searching for a style like mine, but can't find it
Nah, they can't find it, nah they can't find it
Searching for a style like mine, but can't find it
Nah, they can't find it, nah they can't find it
Nah, they can't find it

[Dom Pachino]
Smile on my face, nine on my waist
You feel this heat in the place, when Dom P's in your space
Atmosphere, stratosphere, hemisphere, dear
Kicking it rapping, what's cracking, crack a beer
Keeping it stacking, oh, he's a racqueteer
Just an investor, making the investment of the year
Like my freshments in your ear, they been looking for a style like mine
But hard to come by, they tried to say to this one guy
My son fry was close, but not cigario
I laced none of the niggas that we know, the masses, the people
The shit's like trash, man, and ours is the lethal
The first to get served, man, and they are the sequel
In other words, I'm saying, these niggas is not equal
I supply the street music, at the same time, I slip a jewel in it
Like a slug in a clip that's tight, but it fitted
There's no limit, to my existance

[Chorus]</pre>
