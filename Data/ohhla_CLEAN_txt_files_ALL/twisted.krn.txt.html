It's so confusing
Let's take em back to the old school
Where we played the game with no rules
Long before Pro Tools

[K-Rino]
In one hour, I predict that your flow will be dirt worthless
I'm too great to raise hell, I'll just lower the earth's surface
I play with the skills, most are not able to deal
I smothered his photograph, and he suffocated for real
K usually says things, that leave my opposition truly scared
Forget rice, I'm spewing hot uzi led at the newly weds
Deep as the deepest sea, born to write frequently
And that's the reason, I got a extra set of hands where my feet should be
Nothing you speak is new, my speeches turn the people blue
Cut myself on stage, and make my body fluids leak from you
The big bread cutter, what I utter could make the feds stutter
Nano diamond skull plate, media write head butter
Once I arrive, it's little talking just simply slugs
Soak it in waterless tubs, and drink it from empty jugs
So who contest'll be my next question
They discovered his chest flestering, side evecent arrest wound at a Best Western

[Chorus - 2x]
Every verse I have is, loaded with twisted graphics
Lyrical instant classics, so intricately crafted
Wizardry fully packed with, powers and mystic magic
People are lifted, by the greatness of each gifted passage

[K-Rino]
Attempts to stop the spell, would probably fail
They found parts of his body shell inside a whale, on a beach in Cozumel
Me losing to coward frauds, that's about the odds
Of a jouster sword, hitting a octopod from seven thousand yards
Each day, between the time of three and six
I usually read a list of weak emcees to diss, and eat em whole like feeder fish
Once you cock your tongue, and blast your mouth
I'll gladly send you down the fastest route, from a living person to Casper's house
I'm proud to be a spit boss, it's hard to get lost
Cause my alternate universes don't run parallel, they criss-cross
I think you shoulda been a cover girl
I'll choke ya till your brother hurl, and hide away for nine years in another world
I had to shoot paragraphs at you, attributes are absolute
So now they dragging you, while wrapped up in a new plastic suit
I get's it done, K the magnificent gifted son
Doing crossword puzzles, with ten languages mixed in one

[Chorus - 2x]

[K-Rino]
The superfluous man, heal you like an herbulous can
Merk you in front of your daughter, because I heard she's a fan
With complexity, I'll profess you if you let me
Best to address me correctly, I was scared of myself too when I first met me
I'm heartless now, don't believe me you can call around
The horrid sound gets louder, the lower you turn the volume down
My dictionary words are scrambled G, not listed alphabetically
Which means, you gotta hope to find em randomly
I write my anthems on trampolines
Hold you with my left hand, and keep beating you with my right hand like a tambourine
The gasoline is doused, somebody caution his spouse
Two in the morning, I'm setting fire to an arsonists's house
Massive bigger, monographs are blasted via rapid triggers
Spent my childhood, playing with serial killer action figures
I'm not an average human, looked into a crystal ball
And saw myself alone, at my two hundred year class reunion

(*talking*)
Real lyricism never dies, if you a lyricist
You'll be one for eternity, real lyricists never fall off
They just evolve and get greater, yeah
We keep hitting you with these twisted graphics, S.P.C.</pre>
