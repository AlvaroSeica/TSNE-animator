(AWWWWW BABBBYY)

[Ms Kraie]
You got caught in the act &amp; you couldn't even deny it
Red handed stole my heart away &amp; took it like a bandit (took it)
Now you can't even look me in the face &amp; tell me y you did it
Why she have to take my place (she had to take my place)
You cheated once before &amp; I forgave you without thinking
Ahora me lo pienso mas
That's why you got me trippen (you got me trippen)
[?]
But you act like you don't listen walk away for no reason
This love I have for won't let me get away
Maybe for the kids the only reason why I stay (that's right)
I wish that I could just let you go this easy
Maybe I'm just lying to myself you'll never miss me

[Chorus]
Every time I see you walking by
I get a thrill, you don't notice me
But in time you will
I must make you understand...

[Payaso]
I need a girl who understands me &amp; understands how hard life is being a G in the streets
Other hynas come around &amp; wanna take me for me
But baby girl please believe that my love is true
They may have had me one night but I'm yours life
And I'm married to the streets &amp; my gangs my wife
So when I'm out in the calles up way past dark
Know your love is on my mind &amp; I keep it in my heart
They call me payaso some call me clown
But my smiles just a frown turned upside down
I need a special lady cause my lifes so crazy
To settle down with this vato raise my babies

[Chorus]
Every time I see you walking by
I get a thrill, you don't notice me
But in time you will
I must make you understand..

[Ms Krazie]
You think those other hynas were really down for you? (you think so?)
You think that they'll be there like I have been for you? (bullshit)
Nobody will replace the mother of your kids (nadie baby nadie)
Even if she tells that she will she only wished
I've been thru it &amp; I rode for you baby (I ride for you mijo)
And it's about time you let them know that I'm your lady
Quit all the games (quit it) quit all the fussin (quit it)
Grow up &amp; get real respect me &amp; love me
Cause nobody (nobody) will ever love you like I do
And nobody (nobody) will let you do the things I do (nadie)
Who let you hit it any way that you like? (me)
And you know no other ruca does it like I do on the mic (that's right)

[Chorus]
Every time I see you walking by
I get a thrill, you don't notice me
But in time you will
I must make you understand..

[Payaso]
Ya I hear what your saying mija
Don't even trip
This rap shit this gang shit I still come home to you girl
That's right</pre>
