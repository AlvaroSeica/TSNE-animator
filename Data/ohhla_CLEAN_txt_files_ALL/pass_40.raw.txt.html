[Intro]
Money B
Money B
Money B
Money B

Hey whats
Yo, yo, yo
She was fine as hell

Heyyy everyyyyyybodyyyy
Pass the 40
We came here to party
Pass the 40, pass pass the 40

Heyyy everyyyyyybodyyyy
Pass the 40
We came here to party
Pass the 40, pass pass the 40

When me and my homeboys are hangin out
There's just one thing to do
Make sure that we hit the liquor store
To get us a 40 of brew
Whaaat? 40 of brew, 40 of brew
It's our favourite thing to do
Roll up a big fat joint or 2
And an Ice cold 40

[Verse 1: Money B]
Got my lips on it
B drips on it
Cuz the 40 is nice and chilly
Meal time know why where my food troop
Cuz I got my dirty meat my veggie and my 40 brew
I got the duggets and still drive a bucket
So, eh yo don't be beepin at my fun
(What it be then?)
On the groove I kinda dig a bit
Now who's next to take a swig of it?

[Verse 2: Pee Wee]
Livin like a pimp, that full throttle
Hittin on a 40 bottle
That's my aphrodisiac, so fuck a shrimp throttle
Got to go and get a blunt and let it flow me like a trumpet
It keeps me actin shitty, I'm the baby and the 40 is the titty
And my clique, we don't get sick over shit like this
Don't be laggin, I ain't gaggin pass the dragon piss
Now I'm takin hits to the head, takin a bitch to the bed
You niggaz are hard like lead, then its time to go
Nigga take the 40 yo

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Ahh shiddidit, look who's on my dididickk
Wanna take a flick with the nigga cuz the games thick
Rip this shit, I let the shit get ripped
And If I slip, niggaz is quick to trip
So rip, while I kick the shit that'll get ya licked
2pacalyspe straight droppin shit
You thought I'd be quittin, there's more though
I floor whores like a Sho'Nuff porno
The 40

[Chorus]
Heyyy everyyyyyybodyyyy
Pass the 40
We came to party
Pass the 40, pass pass the 40

Heyyy everyyyyyybodyyyy
Pass the 40
We came to party
Pass the 40, pass pass the 40

[Verse 4: Saafir]
Its more bitch and hoe shit
Droppin 40 doggs for the rough usin click
To the right is the dank to the left is the drank
Don't get to close cuz it's comatose
And my breath stank real bad
If you feel sad, get you a hefty fat sac or a glad bag
Add to your memo, but now you should of learned
You wanna hear so feel the sauce
So you don't matter gettin down, we gettin burned
I'm feelin kinda groovy like that after party
I can't hit the weed, indeed it makes my paranoid
Real swift though, I can drink Cisco all night
Until I start feelin a horny thorn on my balls right
Fartin like an aardvark, now my booty stank
(smells like shit)
Judy pass the drink and shut the hell up
Now lets speak like a freak
Just as long as you don't leak on my sheets
We cool, livin real swell
Gettin fucked up with Money B, Mac Mall, 2Pac and Stretch, yeah
I'm feelin kinda dizzy on my 40 dogg shuffle
Somebody else take the 40

[Verse 5: Stretch]
Before I fall for the mic
I'll let you know that I'm pissy drunk, yo
Pass around the stunk
As I'm rippin up the funk, yo
Professional pimpsta
You wanna get a glimpsa
And criminal minded
And baby face finsta
Pass the 40

[Chorus]
Heyyy everyyyyyybodyyyy
Pass the 40
We came here to party
Pass the 40, pass pass the 40

Heyyy everyyyyyybodyyyy
Pass the 40
We came here to party
Pass the 40, pass pass the 40

[Verse 6: Mac Mall]
Ok
Mac Mall lyricist ready so flowso
Eh song this mic ? four O
English beer
(? ? my nigga)
You goddamn right, now thanks a lot my niggaz
Well I'm a keep raw like it just don't stop
(? ? ? world)
Eh man I'm drunk like Pac
So just gimme the finna, finna of the doubt
And I'm a still rock strong, with the two in my mouth
Look I take it like a drunk, but alcoholics what you call it
Be higher then a skyscraper and like paper
Ballin up and but then I send it to the next fools
Pop it, drop it
Yea cuz we makes it good, make it, take it
To the highest of the industry, suckaz fuckaz
All, they be wishin we'd fall
But this is 8 ball and what I drink up
But I'm a Puerto wreckin to my nigga lil Cheetah
Check it, passin the 40 is what we speakin on
We finally made a cut to rock your butt, get your freakin on
And get you hot and wet, and ready to put it in
The tape deck, the game of great sweat
From all the huffin and puffin and jumpin
Up and down from the older 8, the K, the land
The town is pumpin the sound and make it pound
Nothin phony, you know to the homies

[Chorus]
Heyyy everyyyyyybodyyyy
Pass the 40
We came here to party
Pass the 40, pass pass the 40

Heyyy everyyyyyybodyyyy
Pass the 40
We came here to party
Pass the 40, pass pass the 40

[Verse 7: D The Poet 151]
Now with the 40 I win
Genuine P.U. and K
Fakin the F.U. A.K
(D the poet is like an A.K.)
Automatic anti-static duct remover
Nubian hoover, so I'm removin the manure
Scoopin'em up and roughin them with the handle of my shovel
When I turn 2 I was known as a lil devil
Now I'm 19 rippin up the rap scene
Things are cop-acetic so I think that you should get it
Through your head I like 40's, plus I like jackin
Not from New York, but since 10 I have been rappin
Where I dwell, at this time its no importance
Here's a corner for your freestyle cause it didn't make no sense
Not censor me but what I mean is get an Akki
Before I love to try to crack a skull and ?
I'm the black baron but not the Kamikaze
Put your punk ass back in the closet, that's H.I.V. positive
Visually the physical not one can parallel
Face up to the madness, and you watch what I will swell
Like a ball park, you stuck in the dark, becuz I'm swift
Wit the fully automatics, but I need it for my spliff
So take a whiff can you smell the coffee brewin
For certain, it's curtains, you'll be hurtin
Ain't no future in your purpin
Checkin Jimmy tryin to get a nut off
But you couldn't come off
Mon pass the 40 off

[Chorus]
Heyyy everyyyyyybodyyyy
Pass the 40
We came here to party
Pass the 40, pass pass the 40

Heyyy everyyyyyybodyyyy
Pass the 40
We came here to party
Pass the 40, pass pass the 40

[Verse 8: Bulldog]
Well here I come
(for what?)
An orgasm
I see your mic then I have a 40 spasm
Me ?
I'm Mr. Crunch man a serial ripe
Hold up styles, then I begin to slaughter
And I can see through you like a glass of water
You weak you show no style of no kind
Stop robbin, so fake from behind
Look see I control the show
Sayin rhymes like pretend, I mean I mean pretendo
Sloppy drinker, sloppy drinker
Theres so many 40's one man can't keep up
I seen a girl all types of brands
20 different gingers and 20 different lambs
I'm smart now, so I'm a bit Budweiser
Caught my 40 cheating, you could say I surpriseda
Shamrock even told me so
I rap in the dark, with my mic den it glow
Four O dash O Zee rollin in the land with my 40 next to me
On my side, police let me slide
I made a left turn when I should of made a right
Lettin you know I'm a real funk stony
Go collect my money cuz the tool owe me

[Chorus]
Heyyy everyyyyyybodyyyy
Pass the 40
We came here to party
Pass the 40, pass pass the 40

Heyyy everyyyyyybodyyyy
Pass the 40
We came here to party
Pass the 40, pass pass the 40

[Verse 9: Money B]
Yo, I have an L card style of rap
Cuz that's how fat it is
When attack I macs
Unpack my adjectives nows
A couple of conjunctions for my adverbs
A freak of gettin frontin fools, foul like a bad word
My hookers are the lookers hookin up, never hard to do
Got so much soul true, my boots smell like barbecue
Mac Mall, B-Daz, Razel, fuse they know me
Freckles on my mother, love to chug a 40 O Zee
One to the face then I'm faded like a high top
You thinkin I will quit, but now I'm drunk, and thinkin why stop?
David is down, so I turn to my constevido
Say what up Mac Mall ?
Diggin all the vibes, but that's how my mind is blowed out
Coliseums do it, but Money has never showed up
Plus I'm feelin hornier then traffic jams
We bust begin to bubble in my brain
Shame I can't hack ya down
So I do what any ninja does
Call up brenda, to benda, and benda and benda and benda
Pretenda, senda, Linda, two friendsa, mine help me hold up all friends
Out the winda
Remember I'm the small fry who never soaks in ketchup
Fuse refuses to lose, so we won't say lets up
Let the rap stand up, to other brothers, who ran with some other brothers
Other dudes, golly gee, damn nerve
Pass the 40

[Chorus]
Heyyy everyyyyyybodyyyy
Pass the 40
We came here to party
Pass the 40, pass pass the 40

Heyyy everyyyyyybodyyyy
Pass the 40
We came here to party
Pass the 40, pass pass the 40

[Outro]
I said shake it
I said, I said, I said
Get wet
One time
For your mind
One tier
Here we go now
I don't stop
And you don't stop
Hurra Hunurra
Haha, yeah
One tier
Big boy
Baby one time
I don't, don't
One time
I said shake
You don't stop
I don't stop
We shake it don't we?
One time blow your mind
With the disco rhymes
Pass the 40</pre>
