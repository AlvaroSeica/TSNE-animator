[Verse 1]
I got seven ways to say something different
If you're allergic to the truth, then I suggest you keep your distance
Plug your ears and listen to the sound of a hard heart
Whose trust was pulled one too many times by these card sharks
I spark a charge that darts across the charts
Set far apart from the garbage they're calling our art
I start a lot of controversy. Afraid that we're dissing you?
From the big willie cats to the underground and miniscule?
Honestly, it's anyone polluting the subliminal
If that's you, retribution is unconditional
I'm willing to commit career suicide
If I know that it could fill all your emptiness inside
But I'm confident that top-billing and ripping the veil
Is my job and heart throbs with all it entails
Can't fail, found success when feet hit the trail
Dues paid? Yes y'all, check's in the mail...

[Hook]
It's all about timing and it's about time
To get inside your spine and change your state of mind
You waiting for the music that you need to remember?
Forget all the rest, 'cause that's when we enter
Right about now, we step into your space
Run up on your intellect and look you in the face
Are you tired of being lied to? That's all we're asking
It's time for a change, Mars ILL, enter the dragon...

[Verse 2]
We did a show but nobody showed up
We did another couple. Ten people came to show love
Not trying to blow up, just need to make this music
Can't explain it. It's just like I'm breathing when I do it
Keeping muted's not an option. It's more like a death wish
Got verses trapped inside and I gotta let them exit
The curse I'm blessed with, I consider very precious
Proceed with caution. This could crack your solar plexus
Next, we did a few hundred shows in a row
Hit the road time and again and watched the revolution grow
Keeping it moving to help you establish what's what
Watch the masses mouth the words to "Sphere" and "Love's Not"
Wait at the bus stop with agenda in hand
Yelling, "Bust shots in the air, not into your fellow man!"
Tell a friend, tell a foe and I'll tell a few of mine
We can change the whole world one soul at time...

[Hook]

[Bridge]
M-A-R-S-I-Double L
Rocking the bells, so go home and tell
Everyone on your block we got records to sell
M-A-R-S-I-Double L
M-A-R-S-I-Double L
Rocking the bells, so go home and tell
Everyone on your block who taught you how to spell
M-A-R-S-I-Double L...

[Verse 3]
Yeah, you talking loud, but you ain't saying no thang
Throw slang across the map and watch both coasts change
Grow fame one step at a time. Start with no name
"Breathe Slow" banging in the front row sang by
Everyone who came to the show, change the old game
See everybody doesn't flow the same
So take your gold fangs and fronts and say what you want
But understand that I've held your number from the jump
It's something sort of resembling your new favorite record and rap group
Grab raw skill and toss it at you
Get under your skin like a tattoo with permanent results
That's provided you have a pulse
Full of useful information on life, love and hatred
Learning from mistakes, the breaks and proper placement
Knowing when to dish it out and knowing when to take it
God is the answer when all else is makeshift...</pre>
