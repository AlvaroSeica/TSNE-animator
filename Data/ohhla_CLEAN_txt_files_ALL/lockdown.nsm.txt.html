[Chorus: Greg Nice]
You wanna know who got shit on lockdown?

Huff and puff and blow the house down

You wanna know who got shit on lockdown?

[Greg Nice]
Greg N-I-C-E, my style be stickin to your soul like paint
Don't tell me that it ain't
Never ever think about frontin on the man
Man with the dutchmaster in his hand
Boogie Down nucca, I don't bite my tongue
Straight fluent motherfucker
In the summertime it be dimes at the Rucker
From the old school used to play chuck-a-nucca
Tell me how it sound
Let's have a sip on some Gran Marnier
Befo' I hit the skins, I hit the fo'play
Still be catchin the flicks at the Bay
The ace to the deuce, the deuce to the trey
Now was it the hydro, was it the pellet?
Was is cho-co-la-te, was it the jelly?
The BJ holiday keep the record steady
Cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs, call me Crazy Eddie
Greg Nice, I'm turnin it ou-ou-out
Greg Nice cold turnin it ou-ou-out

[Chorus: Greg Nice]
And now you huff and puff and blow the house down
Nice &amp; Smooth is in yo' town
Wanna know who got shit on lockdown?
Nice &amp; Smooth is in yo' town
Nice &amp; Smooth is in yo' town
Nice &amp; Smooth is in yo' town

[Smooth B]
Meet your fate, we make money in every state
Ain't Fred Flintstone, ain't Mr. Slate
Go by the code of Smooth B the great
It's alright if you wanna player hate
(I praise the Lord and keep the faith)
Left hand got the mic, right hand got the dutch
Nice &amp; Smooth comin through in the clutch
Nice &amp; Smooth comin through in the clutch

[Greg Nice]
I remember back I used to eat Hawaii ky
Now I'm older, I mix the indo with thai
So Greg N-I can get real high
So highway high up to the sky
Bad to the bone call me superfly guy
Make sure my people get a piece of the pie
When I count the loot I always multiply
Give me the bomb head, turkey on rye
Or you can catch me at the fish fry fry

[Chorus: Greg Nice]
Wanna know who got shit on lockdown?
Nice &amp; Smooth is in yo' town
You huff and puff and blow the house down
Nice &amp; Smooth is in yo' town
Wanna know who got shit on lockdown?
Nice &amp; Smooth is in yo' town, what
Nice &amp; Smooth is in yo' town, what
Nice &amp; Smooth is in yo' town, what
Nice &amp; Smooth is in yo' town

[Greg Nice]
Work it out y'all, work it out
Ah work it out y'all, work it out
Ah work it out work it out work it out</pre>
