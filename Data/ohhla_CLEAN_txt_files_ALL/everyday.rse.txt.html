"Everyday"
 
[Intro] [Rise talking]
Word. Yeah, for real man. You gotta do what you gotta do. Rise. 
You ain't really got no time to waste. Avid. Gotta hustle and flow man. 
The Record Collector. How when do this dog? (Everyday). Word. Every second. 
And what we do this for? (Everyday) Every hour. This is how we see it yo. (Everyday) 
For real. As long as you got this minute. But what's the reason though? 
You gotta do what you gotta do. (Brings us closer).

[Verse One]
Yo
Everyday we create cause we trust in our fate
After we bust our humps for some chump that we hate
We hustle for cake
Bootleggin' CDs
Or stand on the corner
Or drive around deliverin' weed
Anything to get our voices out or get out our beats
Hope the masses start reactin' and they see what we see
Grindin' for shows, to get by, designin' our clothes
Life like a fight, live light on our toes
Session after session, same song playin' for hours
Then we pop it in the car and then we sing in the shower
Analyzin' every track, everyday we on the bus
Everyday is a different state, everyday is a different us
Everyday we growin' more and
Chasin' our dreams
Raised on stories of Jordan not makin' his team
So everyday a different joy, everyday's a different sorrow
Everyday I'm makin' ? , like everyday there's no tomorrow

[Chorus]
Everyday
"You got to live to the fullest, never follow behind" - Xzibit 'Foundation'
Everyday
"It's just one fuckin' thing after another"
Everyday
"Same shit, different day, it's the same old song" - Xzibit 'Foundation'
Everyday
Brings us closer
"I'm goin' all out" - AZ 'Doe Or Die'

[Verse Two]
Word up, yeah
And everyday is time that's borrowed
Everyday I'm givin' back
Everyday my daughter's bigger
Everyday she make me laugh
There be days I love her mom
There be days we barely speak
But everyday my life is long like everyday's a fuckin' week
Everyday at 7:30 starin' down a track of trains
Everyday the shit is packed, but everybody mad the same
Everyday we weave through lanes, stop to get my coffee black
Everyday I'm strapped is a day I push the album back
Barely think of fans, think of plans and take a chance
Any day that I can breathe, blessed that I can walk and stand
Everyday a bill is early, everyday a check is late
Everyday is like a trail but I could never rest my case
Everyday the same songs, that they make the people like
Cause they play it everyday, then they play it every night
Everyday I put aside, the Hemmingway of rapping quotes
Everyday I'm MC Rise is a day that bring us close

[Chorus]
Everyday
"You got to live to the fullest, never follow behind" - Xzibit 'Foundation'
Everyday
"It's just one fuckin' thing after another"
Everyday
"Same shit, different day, it's the same old song" - Xzibit 'Foundation'
Everyday
Brings us closer
"I'm goin' all out" - AZ 'Doe Or Die'

[Verse Three]
And everyday we born, die and we buyin', usin' houses
Everyday the sun rise, nothin' you can do about it
Everyday for all days, violence and the wars rage
Winter to the fall stage
Printed on a small page
Spit it then I call aid
Mix it till the dawn came
Flips it and he calls me to kick it but we all say
Rap is fallin' off since the day that rap had started
Back in '95 they would say hip hop departed
'95 missed '92, '92 missed '89
'89 missed '86, this until the start of time
The grass is always greener
The past is always golden
Everyday we gotta grasp, lady grab your man and blow him
Homie grab your lady, grope her cause tomorrow could be colder
And ? is a button where they press it and it's over
I know I ain't gettin' younger while my daughter's gettin' older
Everybody gotta go and every day just brings us closer

[Chorus]
Everyday
"You got to live to the fullest, never follow behind" - Xzibit 'Foundation'
Everyday
"It's just one fuckin' thing after another"
Everyday
"It's the same shit, different day, it's the same old song" - Xzibit 'Foundation'
Everyday
Brings us closer
"I'm goin' all out" - AZ 'Doe Or Die'</pre>
