Chorus (UNLV):

Get into it with a Nigga gotta tote my gun,
Get into it with a nigga gotta tote my gun,
Get into it with a nigga gotta tote my gun,
Get into it with a nigga gotta tote my gun

First Verse (Tec-9):

Bad situations, is all a player found,
I'm bout to let my nuts hang and close down my ground,
I got beaucoup weed, with a brand new fuckin' lighter,
I got so damned loaded that I was on Street Fighter,
Ay who got the fire?  Is what a chump said,
I got the glock from my side and Tec-9 is still sprayin'

Chorus

Second Verse (Lil' Ya):

If I get into with a nigga, I use my hands, a switchblade,
Or I throw a grenade,
I gotta watch my back, that's why I'm packin' the gat,
And if you play me I'ma split your fuckin' hat to the back,
D.O.A. is what they label you,
There's no need to save you,
Family's hustlin' hard, so they can bury you

Chorus

First Bridge (Tec-9)

I say niggadaniggadanigga, unh,
Nig, nigga
Nig, nig, nig, nigga
Niggadaniggadanigga, unh,
Nig, nigga
Nig, nig, nig, nigga
Don't come on my set with that bullshit,
I got my glock got it cocked watch'em drop,
Don't come on my set with that bullshit,
I got my glock got it cocked watch'em drop

Third Verse (Yella):

Well I was headed through the Mac, the Melph, and the Calio,
I cross Claiborne and then I creep through the rathole,
Stopped at the store for a forty or some Crazy Horse,
You ask the question "Am I gonna get drunk?" of course,
Jump in my ride, I was headed towards Josephine,
Blue girbauds, white interior and I'm lookin' clean,
Pictured a nigga pushin' rocks at my front dash,
So I got the Tec-9 and pumped a cap in his ass

Chorus

Fourth Verse (Tec-9):

I was chillin' on Forbes when a nigga tried to play me,
Had to get gatted up, to show him I ain't fakin',
I ran back, I ran back, I ran back around the corner,
Now all was on my mind was that this nigga was a goner,
I looked to my right, who could it be?
It was my nigga Lil' Ya he down with U-N-L-V

Chorus

Fifth Verse (Lil' Ya):

Well I was headed down Dryades made a turn on Sixth Street,
Dived on Baronne and then a nigga tried to play me,
Get out your car because I gotta have your trues and bauds,
Looked at him stupid then I punched him in his fuckin' nose,
Got in my car, booted up my hoes, had to shine,
I made the block and then I'm bangin' with my fuckin' nine

Chorus

Sixth Verse (Yella):

I was walkin' down the street to go and score a bag of weed,
When a nigga upped on me and said "Give it up G",
I ain't givin' up nathin', I ain't runnin' out,
If you're gonna kill me you better do it now,
So had the gat because I'm packin', ain't no muthafuckin' jackin',
There is gonna be a killin' cuz you're fuckin' with a villain

Chorus

Seventh Verse (Tec-9):

Now once upon a time I got into it with a nigga,
Nigga tried to test my nuts to see if I would pull the trigga,
But I'm a fool from the third you see,
Like a nigga on top scorin' a hundred thousand ki's,
Want to be the fuckin' man, with the heart of a lion,
If you go to the pen you gone be fucked from behind,
We could take it to the streets, we could go, we could scrap,
If you wanna take it further, bitch, go and get'cha gat,
I'm from the fuckin' third, you should never play me out,
Handle that, toe to toe, like in a twelve round bout
A whole fuckin' nation reppin' cuz they got a gun,
But I'm a nigga with a heart and I'ma get the job done

Chorus

Eighth Verse (Lil' Ya):

If my boys get into it with a nigga, come and get me,
I bring the glock, or the two twenty-three,
Pop, pop, niggas drop, there ain't no stoppin' me,
I'm bootin' niggas up and I'm shootin' automatically,
Lil' Ya, my nigga Yella, Tec-9, and D ya see,
Keepin' the guns toted with U-N-L-V

Chorus

Second Bridge (UNLV):

Don't come on my set with that bullshit,
I got my glock got it cocked watch'em drop,
Don't come on my set with that bullshit,
I got my glock got it cocked watch'em drop</pre>
