Keep it hot
Harrisburg PA
Comin through, comin through
Young &amp; the Restless
Higher Real Entertainment

To all my niggas

[ VERSE 1: Penhead ]
Long gone from the days of bein lost in the streets
On the blocks with rocks, cops walkin the beat
Tryin to get ahead instead of fallin behind
Devil steady tellin me that it's all in my mind
Started to find every word that he said is a lie
And he can truly give a fuck if I'm dead or alive
My elders taught me to walk with my head up high
On the edge of insanity prepared to die
No fear in my eyes because death is promised
The drama of my life, I give it live in concert
Niggas swear they gangsta but don't follow the code
I'm the players' role model without a dollar to show
Holler at my niggas if I'm makin plates
And fuck them busters that player-hate
Still ( ? ) in my blood I'm a pimp to set
Fly through the city in a Lincoln jet
With my mind on my money, money in my pocket
Harrisburg niggas keep shit poppin
Make a way for the next man to eat
But first I'ma feed my family

[ CHORUS ]
And you still catch me gettin high
In the club gettin mine
Real player on the rise, nigga, recognize
Stayin true's all I care about
Never sellin out, keep my city in a Paramount

[ VERSE 2: Penhead ]
I gotta get this money so I push the limit
Get my foot in the door of this music business
Ain't no turnin back, full speed ahead
No servin crack, MC's instead
And I'm, pushin rhymes like weight
Jay cook that shit that make me lick the plate
Jealous niggas, don't have me slit your face
With a razor blade, you shouldn't hate
And the game got me paranoid, I'm stayin on my heels
Little black boy, never had shit for real
But hard times and my love for music
In my heart I knew I was born to do this
At 16 I was poppin club scenes
Chillin with the brahs, smokin fire green
Livin the lifestyle that fit my personality
But my dream was not yet a reality
Lost in the street life tryin to find a better way
On the corners in the ghetto got to elevate
Optimize, state of poverty and misery
I know my real niggas feelin me

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 3: Penhead ]
I'm in touch with reality, laws can't shackle me
My crime of choice is assault and battery
Penhead's adversaries stay in grave danger
I should fear death but that ain't gangsta
I walk fearless and talk to spirits in my sleep
In my dream I seen Pac and BIG
And they both told me to get money
Rollin up weed in a Dutchie tellin me I'm lucky
If they had a chance to do it all again
They would be more careful who they call they friends
The sky was all grey, BIG was rollin up
Fuckin up the blunt like he could give a fuck
Sittin in the backseat, watchin this in front of me
Dear Lord, what's to come of me
Once I seen the full picture I gather my thoughts
They basically tellin me watch the road I walk
And I appreciate the words of advice that were given to me
From that point on I knew they were livin through me
Thank God for the message he delivered me
And I'm prepared for the industry
