Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Like a whirlwind pyramind
Word to D-O-C nigga the lyrics here
Terrestrials in the chest where the spirit live
You not fuckin with the best extra extra
Read all about the extra terrests with turrets
They all wait in line for what's next
Abracadabra the crowd went deaf
Eyes went stage right but I went left
In one single bound went from M-Y-S
P-A-C-E man the mp-three man to mtv man
All by the willpower of my great skull like he-man
See man...
I'm much better than
These young fucks runnin a muk yellin veteran
Arms to short for them to sport them a letterman...
So just chill young padawan
I'll guide you in the ways of the force
The crowdll stand idle in amazement of course
So lounge on the drama

(Mama, mama, mama)

Take that nigga
They say I'm Kevin Spacey K-PAX nigga
One mic one show three acts is a, masterpiece
Harass the beast
Until he throw down his sword

(Ok one more time one more time)

Til he throw down his ride
T minus ten til the throw down with god</pre>
