I smoked this dip once
I got high for 6 months
Twenty-three days, 6 hospital stays and I missed lunch
When I dunk my cigarettes in this interestin' and messin' with my marble
I be lookin' through bottles like goggles
My black outs act out drug skits on albums
That and how I'm livin' be givin' 'em different outcomes
Leak to the press, how I smoke- Leak to the chest
With enough reefer pulling 'til you see the special effects
 
(Tame 1 sayin' shit)
 
The west space cadet Lando Caldippian
With a significant difference in liquid I dip cancer sticks in
Bizarre, cigar star with a jar- mentally scarred 
If angel dust isn't from god, it's like the highs are
Follow the liters of bottles a-ether
And get turned out, burnt out from the cat with a high sherm count
My lead vocals love vocals to cop, bottles to dip
Follow the liter format for the mentally flipped
 
(Bizarre ramblings)
 
Sunny day
Driftin' away 
Caught in it quick
It'll bring me back down when I start losing my shit
I bark in the park, my dog talks to his self
My ex and her idle threats are calling mental health
She needs space, I need to space out mentally
Fuck it I'll take this room to breath and delete some of this memory
The chemistry blew up in my face tryin' to fix us
Reminiscent of the first time I tried to mix dust
 
(More bizarre ramblings)
 
And time folded up on this bird- like mental origami 
Fly-away BITCH, I found Kubrik some new mommies
And your jelly-belly, judgmental buddies
Will all be super-slutty, but they too ugly 
Nurse me on your titty, when I caught my rap fever
Back when I kept leak in the Burger King freezer
And I don't hate you, I hate me for livin'
Tell the motherfuckin' worms it's Thanksgivin'
