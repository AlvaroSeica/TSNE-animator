[ Delite ]
Scorpio, and my name is Delite
And the lady that I like
Is one with a classy feel of warmth and sensitivity
Who will be my everyday sunshine
Even on a cloudy day
So if you fit this plan
Grab my hand
And try to understand

From the instant moment I saw your face
You can best do believe my heart began to race
The playboy died and soon I realized
I was stunned by love when I looked into your eyes
Wishful thinkin, wishin you was right here
I'm on fire, I want to hold you near
Your lips are wet and your skin is soft
So let's allow this love to take its course
Float on, girl

[ Fruitkwan ]
Peace
My name is Fruitkwan
And my sign is Virgo
Now what I love in a woman
Is treatin you in a royal manner
For you are queen of royal beauty
That deserves words of treasure
As soon as you come home
I greet you by sayin

Peace queen, your glow is so sweet
You feel so good, you look so unique
And girl, if there's a problem that's too difficult
Fruitkwan, I got the final result
For livin, see
By fulfillin each other's need
My love for you grows, queen, hear my plea
Cause you're my first-place prize
It's all about me and you, don't cry
Float on

[ Wise ]
Now my name is Wise
And I'm a Leo
And I like a woman
With a realistic imagination
A woman that thinks for herself
Whose thoughts are bold and free
And girl
In your deepest thoughts
This is the key

So just close your eyes, picture the love of your dreams
So listen up, young ladies, this is what I mean
If it's lovin you need to fulfill your blues
Wise Supreme Love is my name to you
The quality you'd expect, it couldn't be beat
Cuddliness you'll always have from me to you, my sweet
With the best of respect, hugs, kisses and charm
Girl, you'll have so much love, you'll float on

[ Force MD's ]

[ Daddy-O ]
Pisces
And my name is Daddy-O
And I like the kind of girl
That loves to get away
You know
Like long trips, weekend cruises in far away places
And if I had my choice
Girl, we'd be in a land of our own

Just think of a land, a lovely land
And in that land I'd take your hand
And walk the shores of love evermore
And ride the waves of life's better days
We'll make a stop every now and then
To enjoy the breeze of the blowing wind
We'll expore what's deep within
And I won't stop till you say when
So float on, girl

[ Force MD's ]
Float (float)
Float on

[ Daddy-O ]
With Daddy-O you float on

[ Force MD's *continued through the next verse* ]
Float on
Float on

[ Daddy-O ]
A romantic cruise, our hearts we gave
You were the ship, girl, and I was the wave
Passion intense and love undefined
I give you the world just for you to be mine
Pleasure and pain, like a hand in glove
I'm Daddy-O, girl, I'm no stranger to love
But this I confess, in others words I'll imply
That a man can be strong but best believe he can cry
I can't help but think about it, it's the way i feel
A tear may roll down my face because my love is for real
And the love that we share, the moment we embrace
And yes, I knew it was true by the look on my face
Cause the harder the stroke, the higher the love floats
Passion so strong that, girl, it ain't no joke
Some people may say I sing the same old song
But like a ship in the night, you float on
