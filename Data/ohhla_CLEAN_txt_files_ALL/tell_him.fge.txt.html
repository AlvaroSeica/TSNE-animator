Song:   Tell Him
Typed by: HJWESS1@msg.pacbell.com

*Talking*
Yo heh heh tell him it's like uhh you know uhh
*Singing*
Sweet sweet tell him

Let me be patient let me be kind
Make me unselfish without being blind
Though I may suffer I'll envy it not
And endure what comes
Cause he's all that I got and
tell him...

Chorus
Tell him I need him [yeah]
Tell him I love him [tell him]
And it'll be alright
*Background singing* Telll himmm be alright be alright
Tell him tell him I need him
Tell him I love him
It'll be alright

Now I may have faith to make mountains fall
But if I lack love then I am nothin' at all
I can give away everything I possess
But left without love then I have no happiness
I know I'm imperfect [I know I'm imperfect]
&amp; not without sin [&amp; not without sin]
But now that I'm older all childish things end
and tell him...

Chorus

Bridge
I'll never be jealous
And I won't be too kind
Cause love is not boastful
Oooh and loveis not loud
Tell him I need him
Tell him I love him
Everything's gonna be alright [w/ adlibs]
Oooh oooh yeah yeah aww yeah

Now I may have wisdom and knowledge on Earth
But if I speak wrong then what is it worth?
See what we now know is nothing compared
to the love that was shown when our lives were spared
and tell him...

Chorus w/ adlibs til fade</pre>
