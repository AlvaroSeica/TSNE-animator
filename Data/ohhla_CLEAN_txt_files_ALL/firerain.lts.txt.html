(Monoxide Child)
Now that I'm dead and gone, look at me I'm floatin' like the breeze
Wit' my roots strong like trees, I'm filtered in your memories
Holdin' a candle like vigil, sayin' a prayer my name is Grace
Scary with the paint on my face
I put the chase up long enough, I lived the lifestyle wrong and tough
And now my life spans up
I give a fuck, I'm 'bout to run it in the afterlife
And hopefully they put my soul in the butcher knife

(Shaggy 2Dope)
"If I was to die" It'd make a lot of people happy
No funeral possessions, no plot at the cementary
Finally, I can be alone in my own world
The wagons come take me away from the killing fields
"If I was to die" Would you finnaly shut your mouth
Understand what I am? Understand what I'm about?
Like curse, place me up high on your pedistal
I'm 'bout to find out "Should we strike doom?

I wanna die, so I can see the otherside
I wanna die, so I can fly (Take me with you)
I wanna die, take me to the otherside
I wanan die, so I can fly (Take me away)x2

(Violent J)
I wanna die, maybe i'll get angel wings
So I can cut'em off, cook'em up, have some helly Wing Dings
I'll take my Halo off, get myself a ladder
Hang it on the wall, maybe you'll think it's a gold record
Death, everybody follow my hearse
Why does everybody always gotta go and die first?
Before they homies are missin'em, and family member's kissin'em
Everybody, even enemies stop dissin'em
I wanan die, so I can haunt my buddies
Stand behind them in a mirror with my eye's all bloody
Stick my long, black, cold tongue all in they ear
And be like "I'm only playing" and disappear
I wanna die and have everything answered
What happend to my Father? Why was I a bastard?
What is thunder, is it really God bowlin'?
The night time's a blanket, and the stars are the holes in it?

[Chorus] - 2X

(Jamie Madrox)
It's done, answer's are un-necessary you understand
You never question the emotions of an unstable man
I got the pedals of a Lotus and the pedal to the floor
Following a black hearse in the rain through a thunderstorm
Never once did I invision, me being stuck in such a situation
He made decisions, now a spirit levitatin'
I can see'em wavin' at me through the window of the hearse
He's crying blood, it all stop's and it get's worse

(Blaze Ya Dead Homie)
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
Atleast that's what I was told, when I was on the come up
Been to the grave and it aint no joke
Resurrfaced to the earth with the spirits I invoke
Cut down in my prime when my clock got hit
Now I'm riding in the back of a hearse and shit
Darkness, pitch black, never seem to know one
And the Devil got his darkest demons ridin' shotgun

[Chorus] - 2X

"Take me with you"
"Take me away" (2X)</pre>
