Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I'm so lost
Shit, I feel lost in this world
This world so big
Feel me
And this feels so low
I be feeling like I get lost in this shit
And before you're an old man we all feel lost sometimes
You be like damn, am I really gonna make it in this shit, motherfucker?

I lost so many niggas, I stopped giving a fuck
I'm like the government, I leave you stuck in blaze blunts
Niggas look in my eyes and wonder why I don't cry
How the fuck I survive? I will struggle with God
Niggas will swing back and forth til the hustlers rise
Then the customers died, it was nothing to fly
Nigga taught me in the hood, you'd better run when you're side
I hit a niggas with Glock that the government prived
Get prepared never, get scared of pussies
Now shoot niggas and pussies and gossip
Cried to the bitches, I ain't gon live with that shit
You was claiming gangsta but you a little too late
I was coming off the porch when niggas was all straight
I still wave some hay because you niggas all fade
Lost pounds in the game, rounds to the fame
I went back and forth at the mirror, I see it clearer
My soul need a rest and I never concede
Niggas you try to play me cheap, bitch I'm down for the beat
Breaking windows with my hands, no blood on my fingers
Niggas was dugging for the hoes and whose fit is the cleanest?
I was never the pussy, I always had heart
Coming straight out the dark, niggas left you in the park
I'm certified, you can't break me apart
Always had heart, I'm alone in the dark because I'm lost
(Lil B)
I'm just lost

But if you feel me
If you ever been lost
Raise your hands cause I'm low... lost
Just lost
If you feel me across
I'm just lost
Yea
Lil B, I'm just lost</pre>
