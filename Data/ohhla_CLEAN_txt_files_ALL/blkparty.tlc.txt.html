[Left Eye]
Shake - shake - shake it down now
Yeah yeah, One time
One - two time, uh, uh
Shake - shake it down now
Shake it down now, uh uh

Remember way back in the day
Hey! Hey!
When the kids from around the way
Used to come out and play
And the double dutch bus had you bumpin' on down the street
Tryin' to move your feet
While you shake your little booty to the groovin' beat
To the beat, to the beat-beat
You hit the corner and you stopped
Hey y'all there's a party on the other block
We hit the jackpot, jackpot
What?! What?!
And it's only twelve o'clock
And the sun is hot, free soda pop
We 'bout to rock, rock...

[Left Eye] (Little Girls)
(What's your name?)
Lisa
(And where you from?)
Ninth street
(Where you going?)
To the party!
(Can I come?)
Uh-huh

[Little Girls](Background Singers)
Ooh they playin' hop scotch
(Come on, come on hop with me, come on)
Ooh them boys is pop lockin'
(Come on, come on bounce with me)

1 - We were dancin' all night long
    We were dancin' all night long
    Music bumpin' and we're jumpin'
    And they're playin' our favorite songs

Repeat 1

2 - [Left Eye]
    I'm a big city girl from all over the world
    And I do what I wanna do
    Right foot, left shoe
    Then you take it on down
    Then you shake it around
    Bring it up, clap your hands
    Then you turn it all around

Repeat 1

[Left Eye]
Remember when we did the wop, ha-ha
And you used to make that head bop
Like it would never stop
And them other grown folks gettin' busy with the jigolo
Drinkin' Michelob
It was 6 am before they hit the road
Hit the road, hit the road, road
Them phat gold chains and high top fades
Hey! Run DMC was all you ever played
Shell toe Adidas, no strings, hmm-mmm
Something cookin' in the spot, about to hit the spot
Boom box, baby play me some of that Hip-Hop...

[Friends](Background Singers)
Ooh they 'bout to get it on
(Come on, come on bounce with me, come on)
Ooh they on the dance floor
(Come on, come on walk with me)

Repeat 1 (2x)

Come on, come on bounce with me, come on
Come on, come on groove with me
Come on, come on walk with me
Come on, come on hop with me

Repeat 1 (2x)
