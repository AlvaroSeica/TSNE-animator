[Verse One]
I hope you ready to march niggas
One two three four
Back with the gangsta of rap, retort
I hope somebody quickly call up a doctor go get a medic 
Cause somebody 'bout get finally resected
Oh shit nigga
Goin' insane muthafucka
'Bout to bloodshed ya cell membrane shit
The propane bitch
The fine cocaine lil' nigga
You touch the shit that ya can't contain
I fill'em with octane
Light another fire nigga
'Til I'm high killa
Ignite another flame
Ah sorry I dig his talent well tie ya little lame, look
Okay, it don't matter 'cause I'm the one to blame
I'm startin' to act strange
Facin' every challange shit
Incredible hope
Lyrical amalgam bitch, oh my gosh, oh my gosh
I'ma band and oh ring everything like El DeBarge

[Chorus]
Ooh, ooh and I like it, I like it

And so I said, and so I said
Excuse me dear, my gosh you look nice
Put ya money on her, better double the price
But let's get it niggas and jump
(Behind the wheel of fortune)
Hey, and let's jump
(Behind the wheel of fortune)
Hey, all my niggas jump
(Behind the wheel of fortune)
Hey, my ladies jump
(Behind the wheel of fortune)
Hey

[Verse Two]
I'ma take off my jacket now

You see, I'm back on my bullshit
You tired lil' niggas go in line, watch how
I vibe on mine, I'm shifting the climate, quiet
And if you wan'test what I'm on bitch
I wish you niggas try it, uh, uh, uh
I mentioned that I'm back to cause the riot (Hot drops)
And I come to supply it
Hu, hu you niggas on a diet
You can't stop it
Then I drop ya know, ya can't deny it
My home, boy, you know that I'm a crook and I'ma try it
While I'm counting this money and I hide it
I'm taking it back puttin' ya hands in my eyes can't see
You get to puttin' yo eyes on me
Look how I drop shit
I got hit, I won't quit
And bet you see I'm back in a cockpit
I'm coming back like I'm moving the crooks
Everybody gather around and get ya to singin' the hook

[Chorus]
Ooh, ooh and I like it, I like it

And so I said, and so I said
Excuse me dear, my gosh you look nice
Put ya money on her, better double the price
But let's get it niggas and jump
(Behind the wheel of fortune)
Hey, and let's jump
(Behind the wheel of fortune)
Hey, all my niggas jump
(Behind the wheel of fortune)
Hey, my ladies jump
(Behind the wheel of fortune)
Hey
