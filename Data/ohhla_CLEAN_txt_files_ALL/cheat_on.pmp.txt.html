[Mannie Fresh]
Go 'head baby, I see you got the pay disconnect notice
Have rent, never paid on time (damn!)
You ain't never been nowhere in the world huh? (damn!)
And he still got you in that little fucked up ass car huh?

[Chorus: Mannie Fresh]
If you wanna get ahead baby, stick to the plan
If you wanna get ahead baby, cheat on yo' man
If you wanna get ahead baby, stick to the plan
If you wanna get ahead hey.. I'll show you

[Pimp C]
I ain't really tryna break you and yo' nigga up (up)
I'm just tryna get paid and put dick up in yo' butt (butt)
I'm glad you gotta man, you can give him the drama
You can be his main gal, and Young Pimp little momma
I seen you on Fondren, rippin in the Honda
I was in the big toy goin to a conference
I still put it on the edge like Jon Dido
Choppin blades on the edge like that boy Cenal
You can choose or get down with some true shit
Or snooze and lose and steady out there payin dues bitch (bitch!)
A nigga need to take you to Exotic
Go holler at Emmitt 'cause girl ya wrists lookin sorry
Clustered rings ain't what it's about
But he got twenty thousand dollars worth of diamonds in his mouth (mouth!)
His trucks on 24's and your car ridin bad
Need to break him for his safe and bring that shit over to Chad (Chad!)

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

[Suga]
Now I don't really care wha'chu talkin about
Unless you talkin 'bout me puttin cadi in mouth (cadi in mouth)
I'm sick of you niggaz thinkin ya ass is hot
When you livin off ya broad, takin all she got
So bitch get a trick with a wedding ring
Keep it one hundred, his ass'll be ya everything
But don't change at the crib (nuh uh!), stay the same way
Cater to him like yo' ass Beyonc√©
Stack them snaps until yo' next nigga upgrade
Stay paid and keep away from the bitch made
Make sure you never let a good man down
Keep 'em up, keep it up, and he'll stay around
So when ya out wit'cha man and he roll up
Turn to him, wink that eye, keep that ass up
So when ya out wit'cha man and he roll up
Turn to him, wink that eye, keep that ass up

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

[Mannie Fresh]
Love ain't nothin but a four letter word
Gotcha girl doin tricks in a Thunderbird
Cartwheel, how that feel? Layin dead on the thing
And she so turnt on by this big ass rim
Still make a lotta money with them mediocre skills
Push a old school Chevy with some big ass wheels
If you know better, show better, get with a winner
Ya man ain't nothin but a Lunchable dinner
You be fucked up and ya rent ain't paid
All ya bills behind and you sexy like this
Ya dude straight sold you a big ass dream
Pack ya shit young lady, be apart of my team
Wha'chu know about sliding on marble doors?I can fix you from the hair, to
the nails, to the toes
We can get together, sleep together, kick it and shit
That's all you gotta do is let a real nigga hit

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

[22 seconds of instrumental]
