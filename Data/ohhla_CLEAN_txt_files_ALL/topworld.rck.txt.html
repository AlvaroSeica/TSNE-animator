[Rock Mecca]
Uh
Ladies and gentlemen the dream we all dream of
You got the look of a prince
When he seen blood
Sweat and tears all in one drop
For one shot deals
Blood in my eye, go for the kill
Cuz I'm dreamin with my eyes open
Do or die slogan
Don't wanna die hopin
Tryna pry the doors open
Praying for a minute
Practicing for hours
On the grind for years
One day the world is ours, uh
I'm on the come up now
I'm chasin every lead
But going nowhere fast, imaginary speed
I'm driven to succeed
Neglecting every need
Only the hunger to feed
Now I'm laying the seed
To one day reap what I sow
Only feel what I know
Still out of reach, this vision that I blow
Fearing I blow
My opportunity, my chance, my shot
I'm Guaranteed to give it give it all that I got
To get my posse on Broadway
 
[Chorus]
My posse's on Broadway
Finally the big time
I'm a man and as a man I'm gonna get mine
When it's on set it off
Beat the best and the worst
I was meant to be first
I'm on top of the world (Hey)
Toast to the good times
Keep your head to the sky
Plus your hands high
Climb from the grind, did my time
Now I gotta shine
The world is mine
The world is mine
 
Alive on arrival
I marvel
My rivals is sick
I'm booked like a novel and ball like a lottery pick
Don't live for tomorrow or borrow the future is now
The priciest bottles the haters is wondering how
The toast of the town
The straw that stirs the drink
Expensive loafers, chauffeurs, furs and minks
Rarest and links, barely think, so slurred, so blurred
Life on the fast lane, no curbs, no turns
I buy another car
To celebrate buyin out the bar
Amistad gimme free I'm a star
The camera flashes 
Fashion models is laughin
Velvet ropes and red carpets
Just so you know
I'm in this building
They should'na let me in
Now that I'm in, IÂ”m bringing like fifty friends
Black cards, coppin, shoppin, never seeing the price
This the big time, I'm living the life
My, my
 
[Chorus]
My posse's on Broadway
Finally the big time
I'm a man and as a man I'm gonna get mine
When it's on set it off
Beat the best and the worst
I was meant to be first
I'm on top of the world (Hey)
Toast to the good times
Keep your head to the sky
Plus your hands high
Climb from the grind, did my time
Now I gotta shine
The world is mine
The world is mine
 
Busy signal, dial tone, gotta leave a message
Now that I'm back home, gonna have to learn a lesson
Never feeling so sober
Now that the show's over
A bitter pill to swallow 
Friends give me the cold shoulder
Rollercoaster ride over. 
Now time to slide over
For the next man
While I'm left with the next plan
The next sands, the next mountain 
Accountants, the checks bouncin
I'm finding out best friends and best wives
Are ex-friends and ex-wives
That battle for your next dime
Now I know better next time
A tough time
To come up with this next rhyme
They sayin he's old news, his ego's bruised
Plus his foes knew 
They laughin plus the Repos too
Feeling blue
Back in my room where I started it all
Going through the after effects of the rise and the fall
Should I fade to the dark?
Try to make it back on?
When it comes will I answer the call?

[Chorus]
My posse's on Broadway
Finally the big time
I'm a man and as a man I'm gonna get mine
When it's on set it off
Beat the best and the worst
I was meant to be first
I'm on top of the world (Hey)
Toast to the good times
Keep your head to the sky
Plus your hands high
Climb from the grind, did my time
Now I gotta shine
The world is mine
The world is mine
