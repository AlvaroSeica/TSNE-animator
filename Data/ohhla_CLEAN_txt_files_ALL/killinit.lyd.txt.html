Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Last night, what was going on?
Hold tight, only just begun
All out, love the party gowns
We the only ones
Ready, go, go

Face down, wake up somewhere new
Space out, barely made it through
Every time I get into
Whatever we do
Yeah, I'm with you

So, if you had enough
Dust your shoulders off
And we can kick it till the nights had enough of us
And if you didn't know
I should tell you so now you know

Don't matter what they say
'Cos we be killin' it, killin' it, killin' it
All the way, way
Okay, yeah we be killin' it
Killin' it, killin' it
All the way, way

Rewind where we started at
Playback all that we forgot
You, me, all the shit we got
Lovin' at the top
Ready, get hot

Wild hearts making all mistakes
Switched on but we never phase
Get down, we don't play it safe
Go out on the blaze
Live for the day

So, if you had enough
Dust your shoulders off
And we can kick it till the nights had enough of us
And if you didn't know
I should tell you so now you know

Don't matter what they say
'Cos we be killin' it, killin' it, killin' it
All the way, way
Okay, yeah we be killin' it
Killin' it, killin' it
All the way, way

Shit, you wanna get with this?
We up to brand new tricks
So boy get down to me
Shit, we on some chronic shot
You know that this is it
Why don't you come and play? [x2]

Don't matter what they say
'Cos we be killin' it, killin' it, killin' it
All the way, way
Okay, yeah we be killin' it
Killin' it, killin' it
All the way, way

Don't matter what they say
We killin' it, we killin' it, yeah, yeah

Okay,
We killin' it, we killin' it, yeah

Yeah</pre>
