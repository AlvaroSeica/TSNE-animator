I never meant to get carried away
It was all just for fun, I'm sorry I take it so serious

[Chorus: X4]
Now it's number one on my list, it began as fun
I never knew it would be like this

[Verse 1]
Originally just for the fun
Getting jollies from rhyming over drums
Spitting freestyles 'til my brain went numb
The good times were the number one priority
Then I got possessed like the coppers and their authority
This ain't Kansas and you know I ain't Dorothy
More like the Wizard of Aus
It began with the battle rhymes, then I got bogged
Realised I must extend my rod, create something with a meaning
which nowadays is seeming to be odd, no prob
I'm no moping sod, I got one shot
And I'ma serve my meal with the lot, plot to connect
Affect people's views in one, twos and a fuse
Infuse with the crews and even further
I got love for Hip Hop like Hooch did Turner
At first putting tracks to tape, then Draino got the burner
Coming much firmer than your average
Far from a savage, the only damage I do is unintentional
The conventional man began with Osinaka
on the experimental side, he'd make the beats
and I'd make the rhymes, together they'd collide
Then we tried to get better and over time we improved
Now at this point we keep it true
So should you, I never knew what I'd become
I never knew Hip Hop would be number one

And that's, that's it
That's how it went down, like that

[Chorus: X4]

[Verse 2]
I just pick up the mic and feel the static
Deal with the tragic, heal with the magic
Peel away the bad tactics
I'm at this like possums at the apple
Priests at the chapel, Carey in for the tackle
and what I speak is factual, real and actual
Fools jib at me then fly off with a cackle
Witches, I'll keep moving even when I get stitches
For sure at times I've made glitches
I like to draw pictures and, write scriptures
and hit'chas with my deepest emotions
This self-served summary demonstrates my devotion
My skin gets oily like the lotion, just sip the positive potion
The pressure got me roasting like a pig on the spit
Watch my flows rip, and with it the mic drifts
Feeling sick from doing the shitty jobs with the shitty shifts
All for a good cause and that's so I can release this
Got me anxious like when my girl's licking her lips
I just wanna take a dip and then sleep
My musical archives I'm out to keep
Build up a formula that's mad concrete
No need to compete, you're about as fair as the first fleet
Taking a seat that's not yours, when I go to a show
I give an applause while the weak just pause
You feel me even when I'm yet to arise like cold sores
I hold more weight than it really appears
Towards the fun I'm tryna steer, my words sincere
You swig wine swine, I prefer the beer
For the fun it began, then seriousness came near
I jumped in without fear
and hence the result of what you now hear

Huh, yeah, just for the fun
Just for the fun

[Chorus: X4]

Yeah, I'd like to give a shoutout to some of my mates
Uh, shoutout to Dummit
Shoutout to uh, Brenny the Hulk
Shoutout to uh, Drew, Jay and Ash
Uh, shoutout to Osinaka
Shoutout to Nick, Nick Scott, Nick Sweepah
Uh, shoutout to anyone that's ever done some shit for me
Big V, uh, Weapon X, Draino
Uh, the Big O
Yeah, and I'm out</pre>
