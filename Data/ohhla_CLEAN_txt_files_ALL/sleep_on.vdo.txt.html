Song:   Sleep On Me
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Niggas sleep on me, niggas sleep on me, niggas sleep on me
Niggas sleep on me, niggas sleep on me, niggas sleep on me
Niggas sleep on me, niggas sleep on me, niggas sleep on me
Niggas sleep on me, niggas sleep on me, niggas sleep on me
Niggas sleep on me, niggas sleep on me, niggas sleep on me
Niggas sleep on me, niggas sleep on me, niggas sleep on me
Niggas sleep on me, niggas sleep on me, niggas sleep on me

This mc keep the hammer you can't touch you
213 range rover is what the trop will do
A cruise through the h and the 6 like hudpiece
I'm off the chain like 86, that's hard piece
If you ain't from harlem, I might have lost ya
If you ain't payin attention, tonight will cost you
Burberry plat in the trenches, white diamond cross you
Shawty is bad but we trippin, and I don't force her
I'm an enforcer, word to maio
Og maio and shootin you, you shoot him and get the yayo
Aimed at your forehead like a dribble move from ayo
Get his face smashed when I blast through this potato
What I take whole roof for a 8 oh
I came these hoes say no
I'm driving this shit they ain't know

[Chorus]

Try to sleep on me, die in your sleep homie
Can't creep on me, 9's I keep on me
Time is tickin, not mine, you need rollie
Diamonds in it, bright shine, deep sea on me
On today, turn a few waxes, way growner
I got a team with more stripes than the yanks owner
You tryina find love in hip hop, go page mona
On her, straight stone her, smacked off king cobra
Strapped off, 2 cats with me, but they soldiers
Keep dope and coffe but hate folders
I got some shit that's knocking the tanks over
Crib on white, sway walls with mink sofas
The hate got you, play cards with mobsters
Cake proper, new name frank sinatra

[Chorus]

Still sleepin on me?
Then sleep homie, don't wake up
Some food for thought,
Eat homie
Amg 63 is the e homie
Place the dony beat, then I can eat homie
Weak homie, ain't no weed homie
Been a week homie, frosted week homie
Money on my mind, on the grind with the g's homie
Whole town on lock only I got the key homie

[Chorus]</pre>
