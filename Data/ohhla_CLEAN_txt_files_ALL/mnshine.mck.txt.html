Typed by: AZ Lyrics

yea yea looking at the sky right now
and the stars are out haha I see this big ol star though
Is that you baby? ha!

haha yea ma I'm looking at the sky
when it's dark and I still see baby that the moon shines
and notice I ain't talking about no moonshine
my shoes so clean you could prolly see the moon shine
what we got between us I assume time
time for you get over here and I get with you
baby girl I ain't honey but I still wanna be with you
yea I wanna sleep with you yea I wanna eat with you
shit I wanna go trick or treat with you but not on halloween
I wanna just chill with you maybe roll through the mall
show you I ain't a NBA player but I ball
and I ain't a NBA player but I stand tall
stand on my stacks and I know you got my back
cheaa I need you like the people in the crackhouse
that are crack fiends that need cracking up

baby girl even when it's dark I still know the moonshines
see I ain't talking about moonshine
my kicks so clean I could see the moonshine
but I could see your face your face shines a little brighter than the moon
damn in the moonlight
everythings gonna be alright
I see everythings gonna be alright
they gonna get left and you gonna be alright

see I love when you smile
I love when I make you smile
I could see you with my child
I could see you with my junior
real sooner then you prolly think
[?]
see you are so [?]
something like the virgin mary
It's kinda scary
I want you to meet your rena and marry
that's my sister and mom and due time
we're gonna get it we're gonna shine
something like the bracelet I got on my wrist
It's better to be pissed off then to be pissed on
It's kinda funny how we ain't even much pissy
we the shit so we should get a pamper
I done set the tent and we're the campers
yea we need to walk through the campus
yea they need to stamp us
they need to know that

baby girl everynight the moonshine when it's dark
and I ain't talking moonshine
my shoes so clean I could see the moonshine
but I could see your face yea today your face is looking nice
better the night
everythings gonna be alright
see everythings gonna be alright
they gonna get left and you gonna be alright

baby we should a take a trip one day up to the moon
when they'll be like soon we prolly should get up in a spaceshuttle
and cuddle and hddle and discuss what we might do for the future
I can see the future it's like I got some round contacts where I can't look back
and I can my girls in the rearview yea baby I see all my exs in the rearview
they fear you see they're trying to be dying to be what you are what you are
what you are what you are
see maybe they assume dawg that maybe you are a star a star
you shine so bright
hey baby I say you shine so bright
a nigga get left with almany white
they can't see you in range you otta sight
I love my baby girl you know who this is

I love my baby girl see you so [?]
yea you my baby girl and I could be your babyboy
and I talking tyrese if I got a daughter my sister she got a niece
and if she got a daughter than I got a niece
