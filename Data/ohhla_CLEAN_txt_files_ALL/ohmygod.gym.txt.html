[Travie McCoy]
Visualize the third dimension, now pay close attention
Keep yo' fist clenchin as I begin my ascension
Feel the tension, of this name you never mention
If you do, I'll have that ass sittin in detention
In the school of hard knocks, I block shots and take props
I'm like New York City at 12 o'clock when the apple drop
At 12 o'clock when the apple drop

"Oh my God!" {*5X*}

[Travie McCoy]
Check the illmatic, evil flows conduct static
Crazy ill finatic, sick physcosomatic
like an addictl only addicted to them fat beats
You better take a seat, before the lyrics and the music be
too late - you better coordinate your feet
before I blast that ass you'll be OutKasted like a Black Sheep
Don't believe me? What will it take for you to see me
or get this shit straight, 'til we be busting out yo' TV
like VR, 'bout to smoke you, like a cigar
Won't be satisfied until you recognize who we are
I'm so, crazy like Martin, fartin fire like Cartman ("kick ass")
Be witness to these lyrical riots that I be startin
If you're real, we friends to the end like Chuckie
If not you'll live if you're lucky
and if not you'll live if you're lucky

"Oh my God!" {*4X*}

[Travie McCoy]
Yo yo, that red means stop (stop) but that green means go (go)
Stretch my mind, catch a rhyme like Steve Precipio
But I don't skate, I just been known to rip a mic
until I get pissed off, and just might throw this mic at you
You can't escape it, just like death when it comes
I can see it, you catch a kick like them Yamaha Drums
and that's the bricks, as I lounge, like a fat rat
You bust back and might catch a cap, rat-a-tat-tat
The one and only, always real, never phony
Look to the sky, the world is mine, like Tony
Ain't no +Scars+ on my +Face+, and I don't sniff coke
I ain't got my own place, and my pockets is broke
I'm reppin self, to hell with anyone else {*3X*}
I'm reppin self - so just

[repeat 2X]
Hold ya head, and say oh my God
Hold ya head, and say oh my God
Grab a hold of your dread and say oh my God
Oh my God, oh my God

[Outro]
Is this real?</pre>
