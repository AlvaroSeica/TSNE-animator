[Hook: Salute x2]
Another day another number, a cold summer
Niggas acting up but it's about to get dumber
Gang bang tend to slang bloody visions of hell
Call it way of life, living in this concrete shell

[Salute Da Kidd]
They call me Icest, my flow known as the nicest
Butterfingers with the work I be dropping the prices
They like this, dude spits venom with poise
don't even conversate much I dismantle the noise
The common choice, contained that way from the start
Break it down like division how we separate parts
Illustrating since a youngin, I mastered the art
Class full of scholars, still had a seat by myself
Highly flammable, Lute burn bad for your health
I'm bout my wealth so please don't play with the figures
Banana clips everywhere, fit well with gorillas
Get your cap peeled, that's just the way that I'm feeling
If it's rap we can rap, If it's beef I'm the realest
And they know that black gat hoodie and hat
XD edition 40 cal stay on my lap
'the kid shoots first' Real rap!

[Hook: Salute x1]

[Bronze Nazareth]
Yeah, watch me build a bridge into your home
Walk straight into your heart like 7 mile road (uh!)
My blunt glows in the dark, harvest a verse
Pictures on my pad instead of words
Stole the moon through the clouds, served a clean theft
Roll it up to keep the crowd tweaked like Nic Sheff
Blowin moonglow, I'm Creflo for Dollar Dollar
This is my sermon, we spin pistols for hours/ours
Aim at the stars but I don't shoot for 'em
I might make the sky fall keep the pollution pouring
Organic flow manic, rope for those who panic
Protect your neck or guard your grill like Bill Fralic
My journey aimless, scalLywag brainless cats
Don't got no thoughts like after the stainless blast
Sent to earth fast, hardbottoms cars and purple flags
Jars and purple bags, Gun Rule Grand Rag
Middle East Michiganm all you hear is the chrome bang
Kids go to sleep to soundtracks of toe tag
I was writing thinking millions in my duffel bag
I'm two faced half church half my knuckles drag

[Movie Sample]
I see him on the street, I'ma send him to hell on a shuttle.
You tell him that.

[June Megalodon]
All that I can
Is give you all that I am
Still swimming, fishing persistently
Complementary beef is how I eat
Code of the ocean, land shark time
My lines separate heads from spines
My niggas go in like wind from front porch to den
Black suits and cannons
12 to the chest Rich Gannon
9s and 40s we enjoy deployin
Heat like firewood
My Soul controller roll you over
In the grave with the shoutgun I'm holdin'
So I, relax blow the purple backs
Try to get a billion perhaps

Need that money, want that moneyÂ…black day gotta eat!

[Movie Clip]
Put that money back on the table
