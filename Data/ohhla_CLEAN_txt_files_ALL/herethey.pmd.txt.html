Das EFX
Check 1, 2 youI'msayin ?
Crazy Drayz in the house
Stoup Dub in the house
PMD in the house
Yo P hit the switch on this...
Yo lets take this niggaz downtown

[PMD]
Yo, OK so its on
Time to respond
Did a year bath in the crib now the heat is on
Rap flowin in slow motion over fort like red dawn
Wolverines you get blast to smitherins
Caught in the guilotine
Niggaz fiend and dream to blow this thing
Watch the red beam
You know what Hit Squad mean
Back on the sceen
Far from of the screen like the A-Team

[Das EFX]
But lift the niggaz from the bottom
I got 'em so they cherish
So niggaz kill the laughter cause I'm commin after Parish
Oh my God it's the Squad
Or should I say we Def ?
Just let me kick the shit and we will see who's realy Def
So nigga check it
See I'ma wreck it
Cause it's my turn
I rock this, I'm obnactious like Howard Stern
You better get your clip cause you know this shit is on
*Sigh* your style makes me yawn kid
I bring it from the sewer, doin ?nigga? then I show it
I be the nicest figure for this microphone I know it
Cause I'm goin from the liver, flip a nigga if he try it
Your head is like a kite and I'ma fuck up ??

Oh dear, guess whos bringin up the rear, yeah
Rockin raps that got you wavein like a stockin cat
Just three beats I freak treats for my peeps
Cruise, keepin shit trunk but save the funk for ya peeps
I blows up the spot like "yo who the hell done it?"
With more techiques then my DJ 1200's
I'm movin with the squad nigga now my banks ?fizzin?
And I makes more greens then mom dukes on thanksgivin
Check it out

[Chorus] x4

--Here they come just like I flip--
--And can't rep with a motherfuckin Hit Squad--

[PMD]
Two on the stage, I'm back on a rampage
Can realy check for niggaz P cock the 12 gauge
Booya, got one
Quick to spot one, tryna snatch props and we drivin a Dotsun
And wild deep into my music
Like Johnny did ??? Watson
Our way out there with the Indians
Troopin through mountains in mocasins
Spititualy, mentaly, thats reality
The eagles protected, thinkin PMD
MD mad deep, craa sleep while the P creep
Easy on the steady now black because the force sleep

[Das EFX]
Ey yo the badest stick 'em album because it ain't time to meet
So niggaz best belive I got more tricks up my sleve
I got a lotta games so call me James because I'm ?
The nicest motherfucker representin' outta Jersey
On the microphone
Yo I get on it if I wanna
So try to diss my niggaz and I figures never gonna
Cause I'm new like that, so watch me flex my talent
I tell ya niggaz now I'm not the one you wanna challange

Yes yes and you know it
I flips like I want it
It's the last of the Mochicans, yo speakin' like the poet
No, I never belived in Santa
Never belived the Hammer
Now my soud is so deep from Brownsville to Indiana
Re-mar-cable
Plus my style is on creep
Cause I can stomp 'em, ? and rump a room to spark ya
That as is like that till I'm through
Nuff off to Brooklyn now I'm Swayze with the cru
Check it out

[Chorus] x4

--Here they come just like I flip--
--And can't rep with a motherfuckin Hit Squad--</pre>
