[Boots Riley]
I am your host for the evening
Don't take the bullet out, leave it in
Intoxicate me till I'm bleedin' gin
And I still walk straighter than them thievin' men
5 million ways to ho, choose one
Consider this game to go, use some
Stockbrokers pace the floor and do some
State fellatio and ooh um
Ay man fuck them Federallies
Muthafuckas can't get enough bread at Rally's
Bringin' white girl through Mexicali
Homies came up and got dead in alleys
Cocaine, soda, and H2O
Tryin to make the dough, here's the hate below
With a statement though:
If we hustle for the state to go
Security'll brace the door
They can't take the blow

Of the Megablast
(Mega-Megablast)
It's a Megablast
(Mega-Megablast)

[Boots Riley]
My heartbeat vacillates to a faster rate
Thinkin' 'bout bills and scratch to make
Muthafuckas work til our back is ached
But calculate what massa take
Revolution Rock on acetate
They seein' how much our ass'll take
How much money can them bastards make?
We gon' wrestle fate, tell 'em pass the cake
Some get drunk off Jack and baked
Yack in the back, come back and drank
Some just mentally masturbate
Won't graduate from class debate
Point forty-four is the calibrate
But they'll replicate if we assassinate
Fuck big biz and their magistrates
Explode on the scene and smash the state

Megablast
(Mega-Megablast)
It's a Megablast
(Mega-Megablast)

Slumlords of the world have united
And they announced a world tour
You are hereby cordially invited
To the Third World War
Slumlords of the world have united
And they announced a world tour
You are hereby cordially invited
To the Third World War

Let's hit em with a Megablast
(Mega-Megablast)
It's a Megablast
(Mega-Megablast)
It's a Megablast
(Mega-Megablast)
It's a Megablast
