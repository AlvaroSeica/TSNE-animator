WELCOME to another episode of deep thought
that comes from aimless days, and with a lack of sleep's brought
2:43 AM, lets me begin this verse
If productivity is, pain, then this really hurts
Tryin to compile enough material to compose a full-length
is gonna take my full focus, full cop of coffee and my full strength
Now when I first started, the writing thing came easy
Now it takes so much more for these words to appease me
I put so much thought into this, I feel I'm wearin thin
Contrastin craft with masters, I fail in comparison
Cause when I first started, it was heavenly
I never knew there were other MC's that were better than me
WELCOME to another episode of shallow thinking
Change that line from the first time, nudge nudge wink winkin
So what are you tryin to do? Bring new ideas for what it's worth
that'll sound fresh unless some other guy has said it first
Music's recycled material, sent through the years to drones
But creative tracks make tracks that sternly stand alone
Bringin brave new youthful symphonies with persistancy that lingers
Cause it's hard pushin the envelope, with arthritis in your fingers
I'm not a singer, I do not contain that gift in my throat
Try as hard as I want to, but I cannot hold a note
But I hold soul and rhythm and flow, least that's what I tell them
And mold more lyrics in one track, than some have on their whole album 
WELCOME to another episode in syndication
We come with reruns until you get this situation
What we're facin, is the monotony plagues
When lobotomy waves of the gone-rotten invade
I've got a lot to say~! I'ma write it down and say it
And throw the ball to your corner, to decide if you will play it
OR NOT, but before you choose the second option
Be aware hits kicks and snares, and cadences aren't stoppin
So keep watchin, appreciate exactly what we've been through
For the sake of suspense, let's add TO BE CONTINUED
Cause in the kitchen, got a spot cookin a pot of hot thought
With lots of leftovers to be continued, dot dot, DOT</pre>
