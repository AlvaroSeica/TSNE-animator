[Intro: Evidence]
Yeah... yo
Microphone check 1, 2... Yo..
Who's the one that's been runnin the race? (Me)
Who's the one that's been runnin in place? (You)
and who's the one you tried to find so tough
but the whole time, sittin in front of your face? (Yes)
 
[Evidence]
I'm on another level, I mean another label
Players don't die, we try our luck at other tables
And when I lose, I learn, I'm still winnin major
I jump forward then back and thru the missing stages
A perfect day to make a perfect entrance
A perfect sentence I can't perfect 
but I just keep pushin pencils, no fake trace stencils
and do it all by hand so they have respect
(Shit) I know the feelin when you're dealin with accomplishments
Wishin they would diss you, instead they give you compliments
That's what made you who you are, not what you became
Part of bein a star is gettin burned in flames
Kind of ill, the mind's a trip
20/20 when we broke, but blind when rich
I just see it as a sign, but kept rhymin instead
and keep lightin up these pads like Simon Says - WHAT~!
 
[Chorus]
Who's the one that's been runnin the race? (Me)
Who's the one that's been runnin in place? (You)
and who's the one you tried to find so tough
but the whole time, sittin in front of your face? (Yes)
