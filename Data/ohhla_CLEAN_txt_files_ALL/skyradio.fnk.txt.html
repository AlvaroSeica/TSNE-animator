Sky's the limit and you know that you keep on, just keep on pressing on
Sky's the limit and you know that you keep on, just keep on pressing on
Sky's the limit and you know that you keep on, just keep on pressing on
(keep on pressing on)

Radical ones, jump over the eye
To tell me bout my roots and talking you behind
They wanna come and test us, each and every time
But you stand on the edge, it's my favorite waste of time
Create something new, hypocrites must step back
Cause when we come together it's atomic attack
So let it be known for each and everyone
Sky's the limit and we've only just begun

Sky's the limit and you know that you keep on, just keep on pressing on
Sky's the limit and you know that you keep on, just keep on pressing on
(keep on pressing on)
Sky's the limit and you know that you keep on, just keep on pressing on
Sky's the limit and you know that you keep on, just keep on pressing on
(keep on pressing on)

From all of the chances in a world
You gave me this one, which is the most yearn
I appreciate the trust but weren't you concerned
That when we get together we might get burned
I know we storm the stage and you rock the spot
But some might say this is not rock
So what you got in store for the radical ones
Explain yourself, Mr. Bomfunk

Sky's the limit and you know that you keep on, just keep on pressing on
Sky's the limit and you know that you keep on, just keep on pressing on
(keep on pressing on)
Sky's the limit and you know that you keep on, just keep on pressing on
Sky's the limit and you know that you keep on, just keep on pressing on

To create something new, hypocrites must step back
Cause when we come together it's atomic attack
So let it be known, for each and everyone
Sky's the limit and we've only just begun

Sky's the limit and you know that you keep on, just keep on pressing on
Sky's the limit and you know that you keep on, just keep on pressing on
(keep on pressing on)
Sky's the limit and you know that you keep on, just keep on pressing on
(keep on pressing on)</pre>
