(Prevail)
What begins with an A and ends with asphyxia
Me prev-one the microphone crippler
Life on the edge of the walking dead
You either talk in black, or you speak in red
I can't help you if you don't have the language down
It's either sink or swim, and the average drown,
Some of us stay afloat, and respect the wave
With your mouth full of sand, burned by sun rays
Five ways to Sunday, a fist full of dollars
A barrel full of commerce, blasting the summer
We always stand guard over the late shift
The cause and effect of the light in the mist
In the world of mixtapes, and over sick breaks
I spit like my life depends on what I make
 
(Chorus) - Madchild
Work at late night, not that we hate light
Just feels right, that's when tracks come out tight,
Dogs start creepin, people are sleeping
Pull words out of their dreams it's the deep end
It's the deep end, people are sleeping
Pull words out of their dreams it's the deep end
Keep in mind, it's not that we hate light
Just feels right, that's when tracks come out tight,
 
(Madchild)
Hand to hand combat, gone far beyond that
Armed to the teeth, this is a bomb threat
Graveyard shift, way past obnoxious
We play to win, you count your losses
An awesome roster, original designed rhymes
Find time, to make the shiver up your spine climb
This ain't theatrics, we rock with tactics
And smash on you plastic actresses for practice
The fact is, I'm violent by nature, don't hate ya
Like most people, about as much as they like me
Haven't found a way to say "Fuck You" politely,
These days I stick to myself,
But, sometimes get sick of myself
Got my own circle, love my people
Bleed for my people, need no replacement
Madchild's life unfolds with bold statements
 
(Chorus)
 
(Madchild)
I'm not a vampire but I'm walking on a fine line
Over fire tight rope bare foot on barb wire
(Prevail)
I'm not a werewolf, but I'll force my fangs into the townsfolk
Drain a little cow pokes until the cities' blood soaks
(Madchild)
I'm not a goblin, a hobbit, a ghost or ghoul
Swollen Members ain't fucking with most you fools
(Prevail)
I'm not a phantom, a banshee, a witch or an ogre
But my crews got the best chance of taking over
(Madchild)
Yo, I don't transform, and I don't change shapes
Don't take the bus, don't shoplift tapes
But I used to, and if you choose to
Here's something to pop inside your walkman and cruise to
(Prevail)
I'ma pay dues and blues that's the truth
If there's one thing I've learned from life it's what's to lose?
I know, that's why we never duplicate shows
Your just an imitation you can die like White Buffalo
 
(Chorus)</pre>
