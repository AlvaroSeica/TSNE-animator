Yeah! Money Gang! SOD
You already know what time it is my nigga
Swag up, racks up, cash up, let's go

Soulja got the juice [x3]
Throwin' money out the roof
Soulja got the juice [x3]
When you see me boy salute
Soulja got the juice [x3]
Throwin' money out the roof
Soulja got the juice [x3]
Throwin' money out the roof

SOD simpset, bitch I know you've heard of me
I stay off in the hood, boy I post up 'bout 30 deep
The money out the roof, I'm drop top Bentley coupe
Soulja got the juice, bitch nigga I thought you knew
This a new year and I know that you see me
All this fuckin' money, nigga I be so D'd
In the fuckin' club I'm in the VIP and yo bitch on me
She wanna suck the D, I see (C)
Man I'm so hard, I flex so clean
Drop top Chevy, that's some shit you've never seen
Flexin' so hard like I'm on a magazine
Styrofoam cup filled up with fuckin' lean
Boy I got the juice, birds in the coupe
Flexin' in my hood, throwin' money out the roof
50 goons deep and they all gon' choose
Word around town mane Soulja got the mothafuckin juice!

Soulja got the juice [x3]
Throwin' money out the roof
Soulja got the juice [x3]
When you see me boy salute
Soulja got the juice [x6]
Throwin' money out the roof

Yo girl, I fucked that
The Benz, I swerved that
The police wanna hire me, but they gettin' on my nerves jack,
I just hit a blunt
The boss got a hundred fade, Jimmy IV
Turned down about a hundred stacks
Lil 'Dre you hear me, I'm word around town
The lean and the kush got my body slowing down
I stay off in the trap, with the automatic straps
If you niggas didn't know, the skinny niggas run the map
Lil 'Dre, simpset
Young goon rich niggas
Keep a couple clips for a lil ass bitch nigga
Lil 'Dre, west side deep off in yo fuckin street
SOD money gang PTE we too deep
Call up my nigga and he bout to bring them bands
I stay with lean-codeine so I'm leanin' like kick-stands
Got stacks on top stacks and got tax on top of tax
Lil 'Dre got the juice, bitch I run the fuckin' map

Soulja got the juice [x3]
Throwin' money out the roof
Soulja got the juice [x3]
Throwin' money out the roof
Soulja got the juice [x3]
When you see me boy salute
Soulja got the juice [x3]
Throwin' money out the roof
Soulja got the juice [x3]
Throwin' money out the roof!</pre>
