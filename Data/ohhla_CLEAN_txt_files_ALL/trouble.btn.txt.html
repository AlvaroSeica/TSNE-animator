Scoppy Koof forever in the day checking out Sound Bombing III
All in ya area, we on blast right now 
Cipha Sounds, Mr.Choc aiiight, toma, brrrrraaa
The trouble is he's crazy
Sound Sound Bombing Bombing
Cipha Sounds {scratched} (The trouble is he's crazy) x2
Cipha Sounds {scrathced} Cipha Sounds is scratching the hit 
The trouble is he's crazy
The trouble is he's crazy
Beatnuts
Yeah, ghetto prose 
The trouble is he's crazy

[Verse 1]
But don't blame me, blame it on the Henny (come on)
Beatnuts baby up in the mix
Harassing the chick touching the ass and the tits
While Cipha Sounds is scratching the hit
Got you stuck scratching ya chin
What the fuck, It's off the barometer
Smack off ya yarmulke
When I'm in the place give me my space like an astronomer
Especially if I'm twisty off the whiskey
It's risky to fuck with me
And any rapper that thought I don't want it with them (what)
Be dumb and be-come my next victim

I be in front of my crib rocking slippers with tube socks
Drinking a six pack, blasting a Boom Box
Everyday routine, wake up do the triple s
Shit, shave and shower and the rest triple x 

[Chorus]
The trouble is he's crazy, The trouble is he drinks
The trouble is he's crazy, The trouble is he drinks
The trouble is he's crazy, The trouble is he drinks (yeah, yeah, yeah)
The trouble is he's crazy, The trouble is he drinks (come on)

[Verse 2]
Hey stupid I don't wanna fight I wanna drink
I'm a' fuck 'em at the end of the night money ya dig 
I'm the craziest nigga I know let it go
'Fore you really get a nigga upset, hit the road
Keep thinking Ima meet you outside by the car fool
Quick to break a nigga head with a bar stool
Take the enemy out with a beer bottle (Q)
How the fuck can a nigga with no ears model?
Quick to make a nigga dumb out, pull the gun out
Open fire (brraa) in the club, make'em run out
Jealousy'll get you hot, but the Hennesy'll get you shot
Work the J money kid you not, junk yard from the one baby 
With Dominican got it locked up and bust guns crazy
Live niggas put ya hood in a frenzy
Rick got gadgets slam Eddison and MZ 

[Chorus]
The trouble is he's crazy, The trouble is he drinks (nigga keep ya head up)
The trouble is he's crazy, The trouble is he drinks (come on, uh, uh, uh)
The trouble is he's crazy, The trouble is he drinks

[Spoken all through the chorus]
It's that drunk shit for all the alchoholics out there
Come on, where all my ruler man's at?</pre>
