[Chorus]
All praise, honor and glory be-long
To the God who's strong with authority
He's matchless, this rap is lyrically graphic
Cause it's a tactic to speak truth so you can grasp it

[Verse One- The Tonic]
If you can grasp this
You can live in fullness in between your birth date and your death date
Where the dash is
And your casket or your fancy grave brick
Can be the hot spot where the cherubim sit
'Til the Father says, "Roll back the stone bring him to the thrown,
Yea, cause where He laid his heart is his home"
check the milli-ons, higher than "killi-ons"
What a love-jones it took to breath on these dry bones
Could you imagine what's gonna happen in His splendor?
The never ender, when we return to Sender
Surrender be the prerequisite, no visit, familia! And that's iz-it
Iz all you need is to accept the Savior,
The Christ, Emmanuel, Messiah, the Flavor
How much Glory Flossin' can you get
You talk about a "Baller" on the set! What?

[Repeat chorus]

[Verse Two- The Ambassador]
With everlasting passion brothers are askin',
How're you gettin' to heaven, and we ask without bashin'
There's a price, but you can't use credit or cash man
Sin is ice, and your "works" shoes ain't got no traction
God's not a white or black man, Asian or Latin
He's the invisible captain, check the Word, save the yappin'
Historically when sharing the gospel story we
Assuredly would hear them say "scram kid you're boring me"
But since then, something's convinced them
Because of sin they're fenced in
Their sins are crimson and only Christ can cleanse them
This can only be the Spirit aka the Paraclete
Who you only meet in Christ aka the narrow street
Someone I desperately want to meet
Cause I'm a feen for the Rock and I don't mean Sean Connery
The truth's diesel so all the earthly minded people
Look up so you can see the point like a steeple

[Repeat Chorus]

[Verse Three- The Ambassador]
Is that you, are you convinced black?
Tell me if you can sense that
There's a gap and only Christ can mend that-tell you friends that
It's sad when you think God's only opposed to bad sin
When all sin is bad so next to Him we're all bad men
Word up, it doesn't have to be rape or murder
God's got beef with all sin like steaks and burgers
This should explain human suffering and pain
Almost check mate but wait we know a Name
Christ emerged out of the mist knowing that all men
Were born just like Oliver Twist-a bunch of orphans
And the cross can pay the wage to save the lost man
Awesome, now you can stop fearing the coffin
If this rocks ya let nothing stopy ya the Poppa's got ya
Drop to your knees and then ask Him to adopt ya
He'll take you out the muck and mire,
tell you that you're going higher
Then he'll light up your life just like bonfire

[Repeat Chorus]</pre>
