"God I thought I loved you so" {*2X*}

[Kid Cudi]
They done let in the skinny jean wearer
'Fro for days in a old AA
Ballin so low, most fools couldn't price me
Silently stunt, with a blunt full of P.E.
And I guess you know me
Been in N.Y. so long got tri-state family
Especially Brooklyn, shoutout to the Madi's
My bloodline runs deep, nights I don't sleep
Figure it's my pops keepin me awake
Help me keep my mind in the clouds for reality
These muh'fuckers can't fathom the wizardry
Slow-mo brain ass-backwards cowards
Take a shower, your attitude stinks
Wanna know what I think?
Hey, my mojo so dope, bitch
My mojo so dope

[Chorus]
Yeah, we live it, live it
Yeah, we on it, on it
Give a fuck about your lifestyle
Give a fuck about a motherfucker lifestyle
Cause nigga - we, we live this shit (oh, ohhh, ohhh)
Give a fuck about your lifestyle
Give a fuck about a motherfucker lifestyle
Cause nigga

[Kid Cudi]
I live through words, not metaphors
So I'll pass to be the rest of the freshmen
Playful tough talk, often the fave
'Til it came in 'Pac art, and said true thangs
A whole new legion of some niggaz
Aimin high past the idea of slangin
Praise Allah for keepin me away mayne
None of my niggaz feel victim to the dope game
Some thangs'll never be the same
Wishin I could tell my brother
Somethin for some motivation to get him out that gutter
He's leavin behind a family and a mother
Damn~! You must understand
What I speak about in song is how I really am
Yeah, this is how I really think
You can see what I see, yes I really think
Yes I really drink, I really do rage
My demons out the cage 'bout most of the day
Before I became the age to even rage
I was drownin my sorrows with some Olde E nigga
Hey, we live this shit (oh, ohhh, ohhh)
Hey, my mojo so dope
Bitch, my mojo so dope

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Yeah, oh ohhh (oh, ohhh, ohhh)
Give a fuck about this lifestyle
Give a fuck about your lifestyle, cause nigga
We live this shit (oh, ohhh, ohhh) hey
Give a fuck about your lifestyle
Give a fuck about your lifestyle, nigga
Yeah (oh, ohhh, ohhh)
And we gone, on and on and on and
On and on and on and on and
And we dream, on and on and on and
On and on and on and on and
On and on and on and on and</pre>
