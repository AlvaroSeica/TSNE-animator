[Intro: Dom Pachino]
It feels so good, feels so good
Damn, mamma, yeah...

[Dom Pachino]
Aiyo, I couldn't let her walk by, I had to persue her
Look at those lips, those hips, I'd screw her
Had to step to her, act like I knew her
She didn't buy it, but she couldn't deny it
My G had her stuck, and she wanted to try it
She said I was crazy, I'm a regular riot
She's a natural beauty, her hair, she don't dye it
Her fingernails is real, and her ass is on fire
I'm in ecstasy whenever she's next to me
I'm waiting on her main course, she got the recipe
It's not just sex, her womb is like therapy
It feels so good, and it taste so syrupy
How bout a nightcap with P., a frat with P.
Girl, come chat with me
And I take you to ecstasy
And I take you to ecstasy

[Interlude: Dom Pachino]
Yeah...
You don't believe me?
Don't take my word for it baby
Find out for yourself
What's up with you
Looking clean, baby
Sucky moms, sucky moms

[Dom Pachino]
Yo, everything about her had me mesmerized
It was no suprise, you can see it in my eyes
And boy, she was nasty
She played with her pussy right in front of me, and still looked classy
Go figure, one thing's for sure, I had to stick my dick in her
Take off her blouse, diggin' her out
Placed my dick in her mouth, til I jizzed in her mouth
And she swallow it, I'm fingerin' her tight asshole, can you guess what followed?
Yes it was veiny, yes it was lengthly
The bed was red when I was done like she was on her monthly
Poking and stroking
Hurt her, fuck facing, kept provoking
Baby girl this is a token
From me to you cuz you got a nigga open</pre>
