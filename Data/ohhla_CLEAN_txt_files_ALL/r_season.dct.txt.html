Song:   Reason for the Season

I ain't tryin' to dog the old man in red
The white beard or the flyin' sled
Truth be known I always did enjoy
The thought of santa bringin' all the toys
But now rudolph, frosty, and the gang
Christmas it wouldn't have been the same
But our minds didn't miss a line
See, this season was once defined
As a birthday for a mighty king
"yo, hark!" the herald angels sing
About peace and mercy all the while
Yo, on this day we were reconciled

[Chorus]
There is a reason for the season
[hey!]
Jesus is the reason
There is a reason for the season
[hey!]
Jesus is, jesus is the reason

He's the reason for the season and my reson to rap
Ya know he put bethlehem on the map
When he was born of a virgin with man and god mergin'
Can't you see that the truth keeps searchin'
On and on and it never ever stops y'all
So break it down and listen as the beat drops
Have you forgotten about the one
The birthday of god's only son?
It's the one gift some refuse to take [word!]
They soon find that they made a mistake
Because now is the time that grace abounds
And now is the time that you should be layin' a crown
The givin' and receivin's all fine and grand
I just want you to understand that

[Chorus]

(bridge)
Silent night
[oh silent night]
Oh holy night
[oh holy]
All is calm
And all is bright


Ha ha!
We're gathered in your face!

Christmas it's a festive time
So I decided to deliver a rhyme
In the mood of the season that's pleasin'
But in reality what's the reason for christmas?
It's before your eyes
The first six letters drop the why's
Yo! c-h-r to the i-s-t
So much than just history
See, he is the gift from god the big g
And his blood [yo!] will set you free
So take the gift from the father above
Yo! enjoy some of this christmas love

Ah yeah</pre>
