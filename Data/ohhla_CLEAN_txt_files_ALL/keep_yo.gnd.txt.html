[Chorus]
Keep Yo Mouth Shut
(Keep Yo Mouth Shut)
Keep Yo Mouth Shut
(Keep Yo Mouth Shut)
if you know what's good

[Grand Agent]
You and shorts about to take it to court and that ain't even your spouse
you can wreck wreck the home but you gone divi up a house
in the meantime you step to the next few and blow a couple backs out
now you got the same options you been had
same fork in the road mad grown mens at
you and the better half seen better in the past
and now the forecast is more brand new ass
now shorts come apologizing
wanna put it behind y'all, you been done started whylin'
what she talkin' let's make it work?
if you tell it's tainted now, well that'll just make it worse
better let the cat get your tongue, better act like you ain't had none
go head son, be a good little henpecked nigga
she know anyway, that's just for respect nigga

[Chorus]

[Gu Pequeno]
arrivo con la crew sta puta non ci frega si sputa in battua mega-loop
si libra in volo il suono muovo sta vibra,grammi etti - oro li vuoi tradotti in libra

[Jake la Furia]
internazionale come il traffico  confondo signorine a fondo e ora diffondo il classico
la situa si ribalta scatta la ritirata se sono con lei e vedo arrivare l'altra

[Gu Pequeno]
e non c'- profitto pi bitches uguale pi impicci e a volte shhh - meglio che staai zitto

[Jake la Furia]
Con I miei e G.A. siamo connessi the Milano a P.A

[Chorus]

[Grand Agent]
Now you sittin' on classified data, a woman betrayed now that's a ceritfied hater
she wanna kiss and make up then let her cater, before she turn into police interrogator
and give her nothing but the greatest performance
spoonin' ain't good enough taste the porridge, bush ain't nothing man, blaze the forest
you can even fake the orgeezie for insurance
keep peace up in the comfort zone
can't be coming at her all sideways like Norah Jones
talkin' bout some, I don't know why I didn't come
you gone be askin' yourself why I didn't run?
better let the cat get your tongue, better act like you ain't had none
go head son, be a good little henpecked nigga
she know anyway, that's just for respect nigga

[Chorus]</pre>
