[Mariah Carey]
Ha, ha, ha, ha

[Cameo &amp; (Mariah)]
Candy (Oh oh, ooh)
Candy (Oh oh, ooh)
WHOO!, this stuff is starting now, this stuff is starting now
This stuff is starting now, this stuff is starting now
Candy

[Da Brat]
Hey M.C. where's yo loverboy at

[Cameo]
Candy

[Da Brat]
Hey M.C. where's yo loverboy at

[Mariah Carey]
I don't know and neither do you, ha, ha, ha, ha

[Cameo]
WHOO!

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
Loverboy
Come on and love me
Give me more
Touch me and touch me
I enjoy the way you rock me all night long
Loverboy
Come on and take me
Only you know how to make me
Shudder with anticipation
All night long

[Mariah Carey]
He's all mine
And his loving gets me high
Like a taste of ecstasy
All I need is him to be my loverboy
I like the way, baby all night long
I got myself a lover
Who knows what I like
When he invites me over
I come every time
And when my sugar daddy
Takes me for a ride
Whatever way we go
It's delirium time

[Chorus x2]

[Mariah Carey]
I got myself a lover
And he's so sublime
It's quite a bit of heaven
To feel him inside
Cause when my sugar daddy
Takes me for a ride
Whatever way we go
It's delirium time
I get weak
When his candy kisses sweetly
Caress my whole body
All I need is him to be my loverboy
I enjoy the way you rock me

[Chorus]

[Da Brat]
Hate on me as much as you want to
You can't do what the fuck I do
Bitches be emulating me daily
Hate on me as much as you want to
You can't be who the fuck I be
Bitches be imitating me baby
Hate on me as much as you want to
You can't do what the fuck I do
Bitches be emulating me daily
Hate on me as much as you want to
You can't be who the fuck I be
Bitches be imitating me baby

[Mariah Carey]
I want him, I want him
I want him, I want him
I need him, I need him
I need him, I need him
I love him, love him
I love him, love him
I love him, love him (OH!)
I want him, I want him
I want him, I want him
I need him, I need him
I need him, I need him
I love him, love him
I love him, love him
I love him, love him (Candy)
I want him, I want him
I want him, I want him
I need him, I need him
I need him, I need him
I love him, love him
I love him, love him
I love him, love him (OH!)
I want him, I want him
I want him, I want him
I need him, I need him
I need him, I need him
I love him, love him
I love him, love him
Loverboy

[Chorus x3]

[Mariah Carey]
Ah, ah yeah,  this stuff is starting now (Oh)
Ah, ah yeah,  this stuff is starting now

[Chorus]
