[MF Doom]
Two two one-two...

How Doom hold heat, and preach non-violence?
Shhh, he 'bout to start the speech, c'mon, silence
On one scary night, I saw the light
Heard a voice that sound like Barry White said "Sure you're right"
Don't let me find out who tried to bite
They better off goin to fly a kite in a firefight
during tornado time with no coat then I caught ya
Wrote the book on rhymes, a note from the author
With no headshot, he said it's been a while
Got a breadwinner style to get a inner child up in to smile
And that's no exaggeration
The doctor told a patient "It's all in your imagination negro"
Ahh, what do he know?
About the buttery flow, he need to cut the ego
Trippin, to date the Metal Fellow been rippin flows
since New York plates was ghetto yellow with broke blue writing
This is too exciting
Folks leave out the show feelin truly enlightened
They say "The Villain been spittin enough lightning
to rock shock the Boogie Down to Brighton," aight then

[M.E.D.]
Yeah, check, it's enough
Uhh, yeah, now

How Med hold heat like Clint East is reborn?
Lethal with more holes than a dartboard
Haters watch him, Hennessy double shot drink
like the answer to the problem's at the bottle's bottom
Uhh, from the {?} that homey pay how you owe me
My niggaz take no like Kobe
Even with the the arms of the Hawk, you couldn't hold me
from gettin mines, stogies be rolled, smokin and gettin by
Thanks to rap I ain't got a dime
Got me sneakin out of checkout lines with bottles by the waistside
Yeah, smack 'em in the face, let 'em taste pride
Face trial, end up washed up like the shorelines
Do or die ride, how the dead return
Street turns, keep me in this dirt, like an earthworm
What he spit hits and grows, will brothers ever learn
Worth a word, chat with a nerd, meeting adjourned</pre>
