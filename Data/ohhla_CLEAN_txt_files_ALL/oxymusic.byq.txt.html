[Intro/Chorus One]
Yeah; I got my hustle dog
I gets my hustle off, oxycontin hero-oine
Cra-zayy; I got my chopper dog
Don't make me chop him off
Chop chop chop chop, knock him off

[ScHoolboy Q]
Blood on the wall, death in the air
Birds on the ground, pistols everywhere
Devil's in the eyes, babies always cry
Poppa never home, fuck it we all alone
Tryin to get rich yeah that talkin right
Grab me the beaker I'll measure the white
Heat up the water, drop it in pot
Baking soda and ice cubes make it rock
Get you a saucer the razor go chop
Get you a Glock and invest in a block
Set up your shop, dare 'em to pop
Fucked by the cop jacked his ass with a shot
Ya ya~!

[Chorus One]

[Chorus Two]
Cra-zayy; I got my hustle dog
I gets my hustle on, prostitutes and raps and all
Cra-zayy; I got my chopper dog
Don't make me chop him off
Knock knock knock knock, knock him off

[ScHoolboy Q]
Satan in your soul, let it take control
Oxycontin fiends, keep the foil low
Let the pill burn, inhale exhale it slow
Let your heart explode, drop you to the flo'
I gets the dough, I hustle hard
Ace Hood ain't got shit on moi
Green beans, 80's for sure
They like what I'm talkin bout
You know what I'm talkin bout?
No syringes or nothin just heroins cousin smoke mufflers out

[Chorus One] + [Chorus Two]

[ScHoolboy Q]
Only Lords knows, and only time'll tell
Will I got to heaven, or will I burn in hell?
Music in my mind, vibratin down my spine
travels to my heart, shoulda been here from the start
Now I get bread for my audio
(Call me your pusher these bars that I'm pushin)
You know I ain't talkin a Xanny bro
(Nigga we on it be up by the mornin)
You wreck a new bitch wearin panties though
(Threw out my line) Fished up for sho'
(nigga we eatin) You oughts to know
(Put my big boy in her) nebulo
There she blows, #HiiPower controllin
Our hustle keep goin sh-shittin on niggaz
Excuse all our colons, boss after boss
Don't be pissed that we ballin we here for the moment
(We gettin this cash) My flows be imported
My bitch be imported, my grind get distorted
Your life get deported, ch-ch-ch-ch-choppers deployin
Loosin my brain while recordin on
