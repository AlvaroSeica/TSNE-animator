[Boots Riley]
Don't call it a comeback! I been here for years
Rockin my peers and puttin suckers in fear
Makin the tears, rain down like a mon-SOON!
Listen to the bass go boom!
Explosion! Overpowerin
Over the competition, I'm towerin
Wreckin shop, when I drop
these lyrics that'll make you call the cops
Don't you dare, stare
You better move! Don't ever compare
me to the rest that'll all get sliced and diced
Competition's payin the price

[Chorus: repeat 4X]
I'm gonna knock you out, momma said knock you out

[Boots Riley]
Don't you call this, a regular jam
I'm gonna rock this land
I'm gonna take this itty bitty world by storm
And I'm just gettin warm
Just like Muhummad Ali they called him Cassius
Watch me bash this
beat like a skull; cause you know I had beef with
Why do you riff with me? The maniac psycho
And when I pull out my jammy get ready
cause it might go BLAOW~! How you like me now?
The rhythm will not allow
you to get with.. Mr. Smith, don't riff
Listen to my gears shift
I'm blastin, outlastin
Kinda like +Shaft+, so you could say I'm shaftin
Olde English filled my mind
And I came up with a funky rhyme!!

[Chorus]

{*guitar solo from Mr. Morello*}

[Boots Riley]
Shotgun blasts are heard
When I rip and kill, at, will
The man of the hour, tower of power
I'll devour
I'm gonna tie you up and make you understand
that I'm not yo' average man
when I got a jammy in my hand
DAMN~!!!!!!
OOOOOH
Listen to the way I slay, yo' crew
DAMAGE, DAMAGE, DAMAGE, DAMAGE
Destruction, terror, and mayhem
Pass me a sissy soft sucker I'll slay him
Oakland... L.A... Oakland, Oakland!!

[Chorus]

[Boots Riley]
I don't think they can handle this
I don't think they know what to do
You just got the motherfuckin shit knocked outta ya
Just let that shit rock one more time, let's do it!

[Chorus]

[Boots Riley]
You have just been rocked, by the Street Sweeper Social Club
We're more than a band, we're a motherfuckin social club!
