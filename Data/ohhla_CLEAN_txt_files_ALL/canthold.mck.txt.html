Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Return of the Mack, get up! what it is, what it does, what it is, what it isn't
Looking for a better way to get up out of bed
Instead of getting on the internet and checking a new hit
Get up! fresh out pimp strut walking, little bit of humble, little bit of cautious
Somewhere between like rocky and cosby sweatergang nope nope y'all can't copy
Yup. Bad, moonwalking, this here, is our party, my posse's been on broadway
And we did it, our way.
Grown music, I shed my skin and put my bones into everything I record to it
And yet I'm on
Let that stage light go and shine on down
got that Bob Barker suit game and plinko in my style
Money, stay on my craft and stick around for those pounds
But I do that to pass the torch and put on for my town
Trust me. On my I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T shit hustler
Chasing dreams since I was 14 with the four track bussing
halfway cross that city with the backpack, fat cat, crushing

Labels out here
Nah they can't tell me nothing
We give that to the people
Spread it across the country
Labels out here
Nah they can't tell me nothing
We give it to the people
Spread it across the country

Can we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight till it's over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
like the ceiling can't hold us
Can we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight till it's over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
like the ceiling can't hold us

Nah, can I kick it? thank you. yeah I'm so damn grateful
I grew up, really wanted gold fronts
But that's what you get when wu tang raised you
Y'all can't stop me, go hard like I got an 808 in my heart beat
And I'm eating at the beat like you gave a little speed to a great white shark on shark week
Raw. Tell me go up. Gone!
deuces goodbye. I got a world to see, and my girl she wanna see Rome
Ceasar make you a believer. nah I never ever did it for a throne
that validation comes from giving it back to the people
nah sing a song and it goes like
Raise those hands, this is a party
We came here to live life like nobody was watching
I got my city right behind me
If I fall, they got me then from that failure gain humility and then we keep marching ourselves

Can we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight till it's over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
like the ceiling can't hold us
Can we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight till it's over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
like the ceiling can't hold us

[x4]
na na na na na na na na
and all my people say

Ma-kle-more

Can we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight till it's over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
like the ceiling can't hold us
Can we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight till it's over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
like the ceiling can't hold us. </pre>
