Verse One:

The renassance man no gat in my hand
Episode numero uno check out the man
Spread a verse like a thesis or a virus
Open the iris nigga I'm the individual you can't get rid of
Prominent aura dominant moral islamic
Amazing phenomenon like Haley's Comet
Ya gettin headaches from this bullshit
I'm the anisthetic to cure shit
Fuck that cut up shit I be that pure shit
Expedition thoughts are truck
My mind shine like bins spinning thoughts
Bright as fuck, congruent like four sides of a square
I got a surprise in nine-eight, rappers better prepare
Timeless take every letter from the word I adverb
And put it together that nigga O.C.'s quite clever
Always and forever no one can do it better

Chorus:

Respect on the mic we in this for life
For the street thug to my brother with same blood
One love yo sound off the twenty one slug salute
Ways to display the truth
It's Pete Rock and O.C.
It's on point fella
Ain't nothing you can tell us
Word up

Verse Two:

Yo I impact the earth like a meteorite magnetic
The P.R./O.C. experiment
Serving justice when we bust this
Ya now instructed to thrust one fist in the air
Regulate the anthem for revolution prepare
For the victorous comeback of the year
Assemble the militia as insert the scripture
Lyrics for the instrumental picture
Graphic in nature respect mics I hold
Certified gold five hundred thousand sold
News flash yo it's hip-hop built ta last
Survivor of the aftermath when guns blast
Waving a white flag while you dressed in drag
Remember what I keep in the trunk of my Jag
Suprise nigga respect due when I deliver

Chorus

Verse Three:

Since day one when I came upon the scene
For this mic I fiend respect played a part before the cream
I figure respect last longer because cream come and go
I done seen five to ten and even fifteen a show and blew it
Now I know now my ill escape is real estate
No more will I make that mistake
Respect is what matters cause that shit hold weight

Word up ya gotta earn respect in ninety-eight
Rehabilitate the rap game honor our name
Hold it down to the last frame
No doubt emergency escape route
Take the easy way out if that's what you about
If not then show ya heart
Create light from dark all aboard the Ark
As the rain falis I reminisce on Biggie Smalls
And Tupac the new world is yours
80 pause for the cause
Repect due

Chorus: repeat 2X</pre>
