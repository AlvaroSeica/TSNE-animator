[D-Sisive]
We're haunted, startled
Runnin away from monster stalkin
in our closets, Joe Lausman's
watchin the dead walk amongst us
Sean Penn, "Shaun Of," dawn of
target, shotgun off him
One shot, blow noggins off of the neck
of a zombie's carcass, we are
in charge, Charlie's, Baio's
Barkley's to Bosley's
Angels, too broke to want wings
Failures, too proud to stop breathin
We fear, this life we all lead
Wonderin what does it all mean?
When all we need is to all believe
in all we cause we are the people who all bleed
Because

[Chorus]
We are the people who rule the world
A force runnin in, every boy and girl
All rejoicin in the world
Take me now, we can try

[D-Sisive]
We're starvin, artists
Dreamin Fellini, speak in Pollack
Geniuses, screamin at the top of
our lungs, runnin of oxy-gen
Swallowin a shot of, gin
Following an oxy, pill
A prophet smashin a crystal ball
on my carpet, fuck off~!
To-morrow, right now's
just fine for me
And it's about time that we, lift off behind
Dumpin off this condom we've been ridin
Afraid to live the life, we all seek
Wonderin what does it all mean?
When all we, need is to all believe
in all we cause we are the people who all bleed
Because

[Chorus] - repeat 2X</pre>
