[Intro: Pharrell]
(Get down!)
Niggaz and bitches (Get down!)
You are now listening to... (Get down!)
The real... (Get down!)
And that would be... (Get down!)
Clipse, the Neptunes... (Get down!)
And the new label... (Get down!)
Staaaarrr Traaaak...

[Pusha T]
Top, down, chrome spinnin
You see the boss grinnin, I'm lovin these damn women
I let two get in (uhh)
She tried to let the rest fit in
I'm like, "Naw love, that's forbidden"
I ain't for swishin, that's a problem to the wheel well
Trust I know them 20's real well
Now we coastin, me, two chicks and toastin
I turn up the volume, watch the bass get 'em open
Soft-spoken, with a wild side
I love 'em in the ride, they love it in the ride
We was movin bodies before we hit the party
'Fore the DJ started cuttin {*scratch: "I was already fuckin"*}
Cinderella'd you girls from nothin to somethin
Hit the parkin lot and hear the club system thumpin
Lose the face, you two's was great
But it's to the V.I.P. I got new moves to make

[Chorus: Pharrell]
(Get down!) When the last time you heard it like this
Smoke somethin, drink somethin, get ripped
And make the girls in the party just strip
Move ya ass, girl (Get, get down!)
Only if you know you live
From the club, to the park, and glide
How many chicks can you fit in that ride?
Put 'em up, homie (Get, get..)

[Malice]
Hey, it's just a day in the life
Club nights, one of the reasons I love life
Chicks be, in the back tipsy
We gets in for free, e'ryday wit me
Two-steppin, you see each crew reppin
Slippin on the floor, mirrors and walls is sweatin
Shorty in my ear say she got a thong on
And I love how she move any time a song on
I like that ma, you do somethin to me
Come this way and prove somethin to me
Fast or slow, she got the right moves
And I got the right dough for any date that I choose
I'm open, but naw, I don't lose focus
If the shit jump off, you know the thing that I'm totin
But I'm only here to party, y'all
Carry every weekend like it's Mardi Gras

[Chorus]

[Breakdown: Kelis] + (Pharrell)
La, l-la, la, la, l-la, la, la
       (Yo, you are now listening to the sounds)
La, l-la, la, la, l-la, la, la
       (That are vibrating your speakers)
La, l-la, la, la, l-la, la, la
       (Please do not be alarmed)
La, l-la, la, la, l-la, la
La, l-la, la, la, l-la, la, la
       (It will not hurt you at all)
La, l-la, la, la, l-la, la, la
       (For it is the real)
La, l-la, la, la, l-la, la, la
       (For all my real...)
La, l-la, la, la, l-la, la
       (Niggaz and bitches)

[Pusha T]
When they say "last call" that don't mean the night's ovah
That mean it's time for her to show ya
How quick she can hop out those Gucci loafers
Pin her ass to the sofa and attack the cho-cha
S&amp;M chick, ass pushin a choker
But I thought about how rich I am and said, "No sir!"
Chick was crazy, gave her crazy space
What did it the "Whip Appeal," or my Babyface?

[Malice]
The night's still young and I'm already leanin
Cruise through the lot on the deuce-2's gleamin
The liquor in me and I don't need a reason
Obnoxious with the women, hot tucked in the linen
I pull up, let her get in, she know from the beginnin
She added to list of them chicks that I done been in
Her head spinnin and my head spinnin
Mine from juice and ginnin, hers from neck and chinnin
I'm a winner, man

[Chorus]

[Chorus: Pharrell] + (Kelis)
       (La, l-la, la, la, l-la, la, la)
(Get down!) When the last time you heard it like this
       (La, l-la, la, la, l-la, la, la)
Smoke somethin, drink somethin, get ripped
       (La, l-la, la, la, l-la, la, la)
And make the girls in the party just strip
       (La, l-la, la, la, l-la, la)
Move ya ass, girl (Get down!)
       (La, l-la, la, la, l-la, la, la)
Only if you know you live
       (La, l-la, la, la, l-la, la, la)
From the club, to the park, and glide
       (La, l-la, la, la, l-la, la, la)
How many chicks can you fit in that ride
       (La, l-la, la, la, l-la, la)
Put 'em up, homie (Get down!)
