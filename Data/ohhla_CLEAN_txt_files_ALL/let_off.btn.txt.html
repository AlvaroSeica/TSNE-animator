[Fashion]
Check it ,  I can make you dance, Make you lay way back
Fat styles become a stack when I rip up tracks
Kickin' back, I sit back and puff a Phil
The cool is so damn chill, freeze  MC's at will
Still be comin' back for motion, can't be stale
Breakin' sucker niggas off like a press-on nail
I inhale, I exhale, Now I'm zoning
Freak a fat flow from night 'til the morning
She gonen, cause I fuckin' stole that witch
Swept you home like a broom, then I roll that witch
Switch over to the right hand or back to the left
See, whichever one I use, yo, it still spells def
D-E-F,  And I do work with these
Lift a chick with my dick like I'm Hercules
Jerk me please, help me let off some of this cream
Comin' down on you in drops just like pieces of a dream
Seems like I am a mother, so word to me
Burnin' mother-fuckin' rappers in the third degree
Servin' thee, or a so-called superstar
Cause no matter who you are, you still catch  a bullet scar

[V.I.C.]
Click, click, BAM! Let off a couple
One for the beef, two for the trouble
Three for  my niggas that are ready to set it
World's famous...Man, forget it

[Psycho Les]
Still livin' foul, yo, ain't  nothing changed
So I'm a hit you with a rhyme-shot at point-blank range
But still hardcore and everything that goes with it
Gettin money plus I'm bagging all the ho's and shit
To the critics, tryin to sweat the life I live
I got a fully loaded clip and no love to give
So don't stress me, cause I aint tryin' to hear that trash
Come test me and I'ma have to bust yo,  bust yo, bust yo...</pre>
