[Verse One]
Yes Sir, Yeah Sis
If you can hear through Hip-hop than hear this
Here it is fresh off the presses
Here to lift souls and clear all depression
Cuz I know what it's like
When the sun is all shining but your soul feels night
Feels like you're caught under gloom's dark presence
With a little light shining like the moons sharp crescent
How many days gone by
When I said I was gonna win and I ain't even try
I wake up at half court
The day is half gone and time left on the board is madd short
Rushing my shot, hurry out the door
I don't pray I don't take my worries to the Lord
How much time does it take to run the floor
Get the stop watch or maybe I should stop and watch the Lord
Everyday is a new 24, on the shot clock
Either get your shot blocked or score

[Chorus]
Brand new day
With each new day that's dawnin'
Every time night turns to morning
Grace is new, Mercy is new, what you gone do with it
If life is a game you can never play in again
Would you stay in your sin or start trainin' aimin' to win?

[Verse Two]
I'm so down in points at this point I'll take brownie points
Especially with the people I love
I wish I could win or at least take the lead by a hug
Sometimes when I'm leavin' I shrug
Hoping they feel me like really E.Q.'d up subs
I hope they know that I'm doing a good thing
That's the reason I'm not around as much as I could be
And when I'm around I'm often drained
But I don't want relationships getting lost and strained
I'm always telling myself
Don't leave your lights out, be a lighthouse for someone else
I could do more before I hit the floor
Let me cop a squat, put in some quality time for sure
Everyday is a new 24, on the shot clock
Either get your shot blocked or score

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
I love the way the Lord taught the church
He had a simple game plan when He walked the earth
A balance between doing, and being with the people He loved
And spending time with the father above
If I could master the art of the latter part
I could keep from having to march back to start
There's so many things to do
And this brings me to by chief need which is to cling to you
Maslow's hierarchy listed the priority
Of the order of the things that we need and I guess it varies
From the need to feed and to find love and to seek
To succeed but he missed the one thing that necessary
The Lord's standing at the door
Of your heart knocking unlock it watch He's got a lot in store
Today is a new 24, on your shot clock
Will you get your shot blocked or score</pre>
