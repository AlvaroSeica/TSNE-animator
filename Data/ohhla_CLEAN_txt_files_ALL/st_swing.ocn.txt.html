[Frank Ocean]
When we were kids
We hand painted strawberries on a swing
Every moment was so precious... then
I'm still kickin it
I'm daydreamin on a strawberry swing
The entire Earth is fighting
All the world is at its end
Just in case, an atom bomb
Comes falling on my lawn
I should say, and you should hear
I've loved.. I've loved the good times here
I've loved our good times here

[Frank Ocean]
Say hello
Then say farewell to the places you know
We are all mortals, aren't we?
Any moment this could go
Cry, cry, cry, ohhhhhh
Even though, that won't change a thing
But you should know, you should hear
That I have loved
I have loved the good times here
And I will miss our good times

[Frank Ocean]
Spaceships are lifting off, of a dying world
And millions are left behind, while the sky burns
There wasn't room for you and I
Only you, goodbye, goodbye
In the sky, I don't mind
Without you to waste my time
I don't mind
Without you to waste the time
{*alarm clock buzzes*}
Couldn't be great, without you
{*alarm clock buzzing*}
Without you to waste my time
{*clock keeps getting louder*}
{*Frank shuts off the clock*}</pre>
