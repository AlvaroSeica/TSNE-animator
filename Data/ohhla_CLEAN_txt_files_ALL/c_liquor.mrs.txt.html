[Chorus]
Crackers, beaners, gooks, niggas
What we all got in common? Ha!
Cigarettes and liquor
The cancer might kill ya or sclerosis of the liver
But we still keep spendin' on cigarettes and liquor
Cigarettes and liquor
Cigarettes and liquor
Run out and get yo
Cigarettes and liquor
Cigarettes and liquor
Cigarettes and liquor
Everybody's spendin' on
Cigarettes and liquor
Cigarettes and liquor
Cigarettes and liquor
Betta go get yo
Cigarettes and liquor
Cigarettes and liquor
Cigarettes and liquor
Everybody need they
Cigarettes and liquor

[Verse One]
I got twenty little soldiers lined up in a row
What you want one homie? Man, psst, here you go
Killin' myself, I might as well kill you
Matter of fact, second thought, go ahead and take two
My hands and my breath smellin' like straight doo doo
A couple years from now I'm gonna sound like Guru
I don't know what to do
I really need to quit
Teeth so yellow they could butter up some grits
I can't quit, it's the celebrity and fame
The stress and the strain from the whole rap game
Look, I know it's lame, but what's your excuse man?
Credit card, rent late, wife found a new man?
I understand
We all got our problems
You kill yourself slowly and you hope that'll solve 'em
It's in my genes man, my family tree
My mother smoke, my father smoke, a canidate for me
My little brother, he been smokin' since the fourth grade
Smoke a stress blunt, then he chase it with some E&amp;J
Drinkin', smokin' and it might stunt your growth 
But he's 6'4" and he's been doin' both
So smoke all you want
Go cigarette crazy
And cancer get your ass, don't go cryin' like a baby
Cause chemo, radiation man, it ain't no fun
You better get yo ass the patch or some Nicorette gum

[Chorus]
Crackers, beaners, gooks, niggas
What we all got in common? Ha!
Cigarettes and liquor
The cancer might kill ya or sclerosis of the liver
But we still keep spendin' on cigarettes and liquor
Cigarettes and liquor
Cigarettes and liquor
Run out and get yo
Cigarettes and liquor
Cigarettes and liquor
Cigarettes and liquor
Everybody's spendin' on
Cigarettes and liquor
Cigarettes and liquor
Cigarettes and liquor
Betta go get yo
Cigarettes and liquor
Cigarettes and liquor
Cigarettes and liquor
Everybody need they
Cigarettes and liquor

[Verse Two]
Now have you ever been faded, intoxicated
Woke up at the crib and wondered how you made it?
Late to the job cause you so faded
You walk in at noon and try to masquerade it
Like, "Awe man, I'm feelin' under the weather."
But your co-workers laughin' cause they all know better
You got a hangover 
And shit it ain't over
You're not quite drunk, but you sho' ain't sober
Weekend warrior
Should have ate your Wheaties
Sunday Night Fever gave your ass the Bee Gees/B.G.s
Or bubble guts
Stomach all doubled up
Head feelin' like you caught a Mike Tyson uppercut
You fuckin' up
Get your shit together
You can't keep doin' this bullshit forever
Runnin' to the bathroom every five minutes
Every time that you throw up, you claimin' that you finished
Then you swear you bout to quit
But as soon as Friday come
It's time to get lit
Tequilla shots, lemon drops, dancin' on the table tops
You know when you're really drunk?
When?
When you say you're not
"I ain't faded, why is everybody trippin'?"
Pulled your pee pee out on the dance floor and started pissin'
And you call yourself a grown man
You one step away from a twelve step program

[Chorus]

Crackers, beaners, gooks, niggas
What we all got in common? Ha!
Cigarettes and liquor
The cancer might kill ya or sclerosis of the liver
But we still keep spendin' on cigarettes and liquor
Cigarettes and liquor
Cigarettes and liquor
Run out and get yo
Cigarettes and liquor
Cigarettes and liquor
Cigarettes and liquor
Everybody's spendin' on
Cigarettes and liquor
Cigarettes and liquor
Cigarettes and liquor
Betta go get yo
Cigarettes and liquor
Cigarettes and liquor
Cigarettes and liquor
Everybody need they
Cigarettes and liquor</pre>
