[Intro]
$hamrock... a/k/a Yung, Yung Irish goon

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
I'm straight from the gutter but my flow's so refined
And I'm a real hustler, make a dollar from a dime
From a dime - I'm so hood yet I keep it so stylish
Your boy $hamrock, a/k/a Yung Irish

[$hamrock]
Yung $hamrock say word to me
Know y'all motherfuckers heard of me
I'm the one who gets that currency
With the flow cut through you like surgery
Can't none of y'all boys out murder me
So I put it out there as a courtesy
This Yung Irish is murder team
And your weak ass papers murdering
Who showed y'all how to get the TV check?
Who put they city tatted on they neck?
Who came up with that E.S.T.?
Got 82's tatted on they chest
Who put that dollar sign in the name?
Now everybody run and do it just the same
I'm settin trends while I'm jettin in
Damn right I make my mark in the game
If y'all wanna bite, y'all clowns to me
When you hit the booth, bow down to me
In fact don't ever come 'round to me
Unless you wanna give thanks and props to me
Cause I'm bound to be, one of the trillest out
I'ma make my mill' then chill be out
Cause I done proved my point 'bout a thousand times
And I showed y'all my hundred thousand grind
Whassup Lil' Tay, we done made a hit
Whassup Lil Wyte that's classic shit
Whassup DeShaun, I see you Jones
Whassup BoonDaddy we goin home
Whassup Robert, Looney Tune
Now my album sound like a movie dude
And I done walk around with a movie crew
The Yung Irish is a movie, dude

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Let's do it</pre>
