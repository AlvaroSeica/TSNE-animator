Typed by: Direct Lyrics

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Bustin' out the bando
A nigga jewelry real metal like a can opener
I went from rags to riches to a feature with Tip
I went from Smart Car to a bitch with some smart lips
And the F&amp;N at my hip lip
I'm goin' fishin' with these little bitty shrimp dips
And my bank roll got a big dip
She gon' bring it on a big ship
Quite trill, no Quik Trip
I got drugs in the alley, no tip there
She just wanna have a good day
Smoke way more weed than a guy in L.A
I want them birds 'til next May
Never let her fly away
What!? I heard [?]
Listen what my nigga Tip say

[Chorus: T.I.]
If it ain't about the money
Don't be blowin' me up, nigga I ain't gettin' up
If it ain't about the money
Ain't no use in you ringin' my line, stop wastin' my time
If it ain't about the money
Nah I can't even hear what you say, I ain't finna do shit
If it ain't about the money
Bitch, you can miss me with it, bitch nigga miss me with it

[Post-Chorus: Young Thug]
I'm packin' 11, I'm packin' 11
I ride in a gator, my shoes are Guiseppe
I'm slime like the reverend, I shoot at the reverend
Pants out the Gucci store, they stuck with lettuce
She try make the extras I tell on these bitches
When it's my time to pay I'ma bail on these bitches

[Verse 2: T.I.]
Ay what you think we in the neighborhood for?
Standin' at the corner store with a pocket full of dough
I'll be damned if a nigga wife a hood hoe
Learned that from UGK back in "Pocket Full of Stones"
Put your money down like ya book a hard 4
You playin' with it, I'ma send 'em through your car door
my watch flooded shit sick got pavo
I'm doin' it for black and yellow, free hardo
The head honcho, nigga no Tonto, nigga
I'm quick to put some bricks in a Bronco, nigga
Niggas talk shit, well I don't respond to no nigga
No murder, no dough, no convo nigga

[Chorus]
If it ain't about the money
Don't be blowin' me up, nigga I ain't gettin' up
If it ain't about the money
Ain't no use in you ringin' my line, stop wastin' my time
If it ain't about the money
Nah I can't even hear what you say, I ain't finna do shit
If it ain't about the money
Bitch, you can miss me with it, bitch nigga miss me with it

[Post-Chorus: Young Thug]
I'm packin' 11, I'm packin' 11
I ride in a gator, my shoes are Guiseppe
I'm slime like the reverend, I shoot at the reverend
Pants out the Gucci store, they stuck with lettuce
She try make the extras I tell on these bitches
When it's my time to pay I'ma bail on these bitches

[T.I]
What you think we in the neighborhood fo
standing in the trap slangin good blow

[Chorus]
If it ain't about the money
Don't be blowin' me up, nigga I ain't gettin' up
If it ain't about the money
Ain't no use in you ringin' my line, stop wastin' my time
If it ain't about the money
Nah I can't even hear what you say, I ain't finna do shit
If it ain't about the money
Bitch, you can miss me with it, bitch nigga miss me with it

[Post-Chorus: Young Thug]
I'm packin' 11, I'm packin' 11
I ride in a gator, my shoes are Guiseppe
I'm slime like the reverend, I shoot at the reverend
Pants out the Gucci store, they stuck with lettuce
She try make the extras I tell on these bitches
When it's my time to pay I'ma bail on these bitches</pre>
