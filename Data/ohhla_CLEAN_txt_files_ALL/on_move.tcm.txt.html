I was predestined to reflect the Son, beaming His light
His truth has me keen in my sight
So I can see the true meaning of life
He is Jesus the Christ, who rules His kingdom with might
The redemption of our Lord
Means the Son became an extension cord
When His blood red as crimson poured
For our transgressions
His intervention bore access in
His ascension from the core made our redemption sure
Life's worth the living
New purpose given
No more rhyming in vain
We make sure each rhyme's shining his name
Some say we're kind of lame for never minding the fame
We're never apologizing for every album sounding the same
No time for childish games
Cats are bound to drown in the flames
If they're not found in His name
We're out to proclaim
On the rooftops, Ghettos
To the boondocks, agents
Spreading the fragrance of Christ like a perfume shop

[Chorus]

To my breakers, beatmakers, arosol can shakers
Dj's on the fader with the smooth rhymes sayers
Put the cross on the move
Spread the good news of the Savior
To my breakers beatmakers arosol can shakers
Dj's on the fader with the smooth rhymes sayers
Take what the Lord gave you, and represent the Savior
We don't do as the world do
We open up the scripture like oysters
To voice the pearl truths of God
Which is anti-world view, it's odd
How we storm your hood like twister
When we twirl through my squad
Wear the chains to bear the name
If you ask us where is the fame?
We'll say there in the flames
If you only dig our flavor and name
And not the Savior who reigns
Then our labors in vain
We'd rather be cut off and pruned
For not producing fruit
Hip-hop influence the youth
That's why we speak fluent in truth
In cypher sessions
It sounds like we're always lecturing
Cause we never kick rhymes
That only wins the respect of men
When we flex the pen
It's in hopes that men get with him
Who pays and pardons our debt to sin
Forever representing Him
With no shame bold and plain
Kingdom Building
Cause the blue print of scripture don't change

[Chorus]

I was sick with sin
Now I'm love sick for Him
Who's blood dripped for men
The new covenants in Him
The new government begins
Cause the Son gets the win
Over Satan and mans numbness to sin
Oneness with Him
Is what we're hoping in
Come witness Him
Take the souls of men
And make them whole again
We live to make known to men
The atonement of sin
That turns those who offend
From foes to friends
Of the true and living
Who's forgiving the worst of sin
Committed by the worst of men
Lets reverse the trend
Heads can't discern the times
Even with the signs up
If there's no good news on your album
Then you're in the wrong genre

[Chorus]</pre>
