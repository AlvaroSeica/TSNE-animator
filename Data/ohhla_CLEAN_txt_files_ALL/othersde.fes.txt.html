[Minnesota Slimz]
I can feel it in my bones, I'm knee deep in death
And I don't know the light, but I exist in shadows
And I know the name's hallowed, But I never speak it either
Sequence and signs but that's my little secret
Watching the womb deepen
And the pain come speaking through my eyes
But I can't cry, Momma am I a demon
Frequent this one women, Our souls intertwine
Passions exchange between bodies the void of mine
I'm out of my body looking down on the corpse
My heart cease to beating and my blood runs no cause
My life has no cause, I feel no remorse
Kids caught in the crossfire of men that wage war
And I can't recall or think of resemblance of life
Closest I've come to God Jesus dipped in ice
And that was last night, Before I was destined to die
Watch my whole life pass before my eyes

[Chorus: Minnesota Slimz &amp; Khaliq]
I can't really say that a man never learned to live
Until they learn to die, I can't really try to explain
Why the misery and pain seems to out weigh the sunshine
But I know there's a reason why, A reason
For every drop of rain that falls from the sky
So I try to see life clearly, And hope that they hear me
Speaking to ya from the other side

[Minnesota Slimz]
I tried to get your attention many times
Hear those whispers my minds, But you would just recline
And deny what you feel inside, Drown my voice in haze and wine
Telling yourself that everything's fine
But you couldn't look me in my eyes, You avoided the mirror
Cause you were invisible and the face you saw was mines
And I told you not to drive, But you was so insistent
And as that car headed towards yours you feeling sometime different
But it was too late, You tried to swerve, Hit a curb
Killed your wife and two daughters, And all I did was observe
With no judgment, Just follow the water dogs
There's a reason that Gods exchanged his life for yours
A now you've seen Heaven's doors, No longer will you live
In Hell and claim, That for this life there is no cause
Cause nothing deceases, And nothing can be taken as yours
Surrender what belongs to God, What's gone

[Chorus]

[Fes Taylor]
Yep, Grey rag, Momma like you still banging
My little cousin in the hospital, Eye hanging
It's like I can't see right, This can't be life
Thoughts running through my mind, I don't even gotta write
Wonder why the Lord aint take me instead
If the barrel would've pointed a little higher at my head
But I'm partially to blame, Cause we raised in the P
What he is partially insane, Hard for me to explain
Part of me want to change, To other half think it's too late
So I walk around with a screw face
Like fuck the world, The Earth wind is so cold
Feeling like the game got a nigga in a choke hold
The streets try to wipe out my generation
Pray to God the difference between him and Satan
Good and evil, A movement in the hood'll lead you
X-Ray vision still couldn't see through.
Living that _____, Everybody looking for a hero
Guess I play the part though, Kinda like Dinero
True story, Couldn't air prime time
It's too gory, I'm from two-forty so
My struggle deep like Lucy in a wheelchair
We go side of the building, He was killed here
La, Me, Flex, and Y, Niggas still here
Plus my niggas locked, It don't even feel fair
Killa Hill yeah, Nigga I'm still there
Where everybody know your name, Feel like Cheers
A couple beers, Pour some liquor out for my niggas
I pull an A-R out squeezing the trigger
My hood deal with the good and the bad
Success is right there, Just couldn't grab
Just couldn't let go of my pad
So my future looks so far hoping it lasts

[Chorus]</pre>
