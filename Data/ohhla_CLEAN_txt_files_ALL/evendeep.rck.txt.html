Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro - Barry White]
It feels so good
You lying here next to me
Oh

[Verse 1 - Rick Ross]
I living underneath the telescope
Ciroc in my margarita in mehico!
Got a model with me that I seen on worldstar
Introduced her to the world of La pearla
I'm talking S and M but got her screaming A to Z
Talking the type of cheese she used to think was make believe
I used to fuck em then I made em leave
Leaving things, I had a bucket full of maybeline!
I had a bucket of my favorite green
Open up the budget now its only major things
Most things, run ya half a ticket
Bugatti Boys, cop don't even write the ticket!
I got a few crips that wanna come and kick it
Catch blue balls if one of ya niggas bitches
I know the feeling gotta re-align your wills to life
Or better yet you maybe should write your will tonight!

[Chorus - Barry White]
Deeper and deeper
In love with you I'm falling, yeah
Sweeter and sweeter
Your tender words of love keeps calling
[Ross ad libs]

[Verse 2]
Got on my vacaron I'm paid in full
Lining up all my niggas bout to pull some major moves
Consolidate the game and suffocate the others
Keep it real with ur niggas and multiply the numbers!
Go to trial and never take the stand
Every bitch was born to break her man (?)
I take you deeper than them other dudes
I see my niggas scramble chickens by the twos
He talkling like a hoe and family in the benzz
She acting like a bitch well I'm takin her friend
Ran outta 1s now I'm throwing what I got
I took her home time to show her what I got
I took her tongue and took it to another notch
I'm getting funds time to get another watch
I'm having fun fuck it let my brother watch!
I got credit cards and headed to another lot!
(ma,ma,ma,ma,ma, Maybach music)
...Money Grew like grass
...Money Grew like Grass
Uh!

[Chorus - Barry White]
Cause deeper and deeper
In love with you I'm falling
Sweeter and sweeter
Your tender words of love keeps calling

Eager and eager, yeah
To feel your lips upon my face
Please her and please her
Any time or any place
I'm gonna love you, love you, love you just a little more, baby
I'm gonna need you, need you, need you every day</pre>
