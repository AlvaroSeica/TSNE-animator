Typed by: AZ Lyrics

If I had 24 hours to live
I'd wake up at 5 in the mornin and take me a piss
Open the closet and snatch me a fit, smoke a stick
An witch ever bitch I woke up with, tell her get out
Den hop in the dodge and leave the house
I got 7 bombs that's hooked up in the house
Pulled out the remote, hit the button, blew up the house
So tell the Orkin man it's cool, I killed the mouse
Now it's only 5: 30 niggaz still sleepin
In the whip I'm creapin an got 4 12's beatin
An 15 speakers on both sides ridin with the doors wide
Lettin out the 4 5 waken all the neighbors up
Ridin on the side walk all on ya front lawn Captain in the skylark
Ridin round with a half of that hydro weed
Lookin for all them rappers who made songs bout me
Creep slow got one bow bow die bitch
Took his pinky ring and his chain dis my shit
Pull around the corner saw two more put the peddle to the floor
Blew them niggaz out the road damn now I got blood all on my windshield
It's my last day so u no it's gone get real real ugly
Streets gone love me if u ever hated u will not sleep comfortably
Ridin round lookin for them niggaz who jumped me
When I was in da 5th grade now I gotta switch blade
Now I got a mack and a 9 caught dem on the corner blew them fuckers out day mind
Shut the fuck up with that cryin
Went back to where I went to school at
chained up all the doors from the outside and lit a match
Poof security guards, teaches and staff now see a new meanin of kiss my ass
Den ride by that muthafucka and laugh
As the police have a difficult time doing the math
Shit fuck one pop 3 a them pills
Ridin round lookin for a Lamborghini to steal
I no it's a Lamborghini but still don't give a fuck
Drove to the marathon filled it up ain't spend a buck
Den zoom out that muthafucka laughin
If dey want some trouble I'm a give 'em what they askin
Poppin shit errywhere niggaz gone feel chip
If not dis glock make em not feel shit
Real quick
Run up in that convenient store with a pump they never seen b4
Lights out boom
Steal a fly car click clack my car
Told the bitch see ya tomorrow but I lied to her
Cause I'm gone won't be long Wheres my herb wheres my bong
Gettin high it's only rite that I jump off the VP buildin as if I can fly
I'm in the middle of the air fuckin dis bitch
that I just kidnapped one last nut splat</pre>
