[Hook]
All around the world today the kilo is a measure
A kilo is a thousand grams easy to remember
A kilo is a thousand but did you remember
Once you touch a kilogram that weight ll make music

[Verse 1: The Clipse]
K.I.L.O THE KING sayin hello
from my suga hill ray Nathan he's Romelo
I plays it like a cello I pull them strings
to make them scales teeter totter like balance beams
it's everything it seems the guns and the glamor
the re-compressed birds booked down with sledge hammers
Smille candid cameras goddess in zoom lenses un claimed taxes sittin in new benzes
Champaigne drenches the loafers the bosses lord forgive me
there's blood diamonds in these crosses
suffered major losses then repeat the past
Guess I never learned a hard head makes a soft ass
Yup and soft white makes for hard cash and Continental GT's
with a soft rag like soft batch cookies out the oven
getting 13 at a time now that's a bakers dozen

[Hook]
All around the world today the kilo is a measure
A kilo is a thousand grams easy to remember
A kilo is a thousand but did you remember
Once you touch a kilogram that weight ll make music

[Verse 2: Fat Joe]
Ayo There's blood on the cocain a scene that is psycho
dope so pure feigns cling to the light pole
Wet purer than holy water your wife
know that she ain't gotta fly to columbia for that lipo...
(Darkside) Cut keys like a locksmith
blasphemy but it feels like it's gods gift
One sniff'll have you kneel down and praise me
nodding out holding onto your babies
A new conec means a few more dreams
now watch a nigga flood the streets like New Orleans
blow like trumpets snorting on the second line
fuckin with that white bitch'll have you on the bordeline
penthouse in the city got the scenic view
and maybe you can fuck Madonna like you pee in a shoe
snowcaps dripping off rock mountain
it's Crack in Wonderland got coke dripping out the fountain

[Hook]
All around the world today the kilo is a measure
A kilo is a thousand grams easy to remember
A kilo is a thousand but did you remember
Once you touch a kilogram that weight ll make music

[Verse 3: Cam'Ron]
I said a Kilo is a thousand grams but can you remember
check my agenda snow like December
coke I'm a emperor go head and taste it numb up your dentures
movin in rectas, obvious intra
no I won't serve you don't mean to offend ya
Round table glass up all hail us
toast to life money told me will fail us
we prevail from the corner now
now tell us they got what they don't wanna
let them sell us me I cook coke
Cook coke no faction but damn you look broke
Know my pedigree ready is what you
Better be gotta beef put two holes in yo ass
like the letter b my parameter homie is where you
Need to be... Gambler? Nah janitor I keep the keys...</pre>
