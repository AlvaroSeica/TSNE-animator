[Chorus: sample]
I come for darkness, and lightness will appear
And you got to disappear, through this chamber of fear

[Li-Mouse]
I ain't afraid of the past that lie in front of me
Society, should be scared of what it's done to me
I'm hungry, like starving wild beasts
I'm hot, so you know I'mma rise up on 'em like yeast
Cno flooded me with beats, so I engage
Like ink and paper, now we on the same page
Stomping on cats like 'Zilla and Mt. Fiji
Like RZA said, there's no way you can see me
Believe me, Mouse, but this shit ain't cheesy
The caged lion, it's dangerous to free me
Frankly, it doesn't matter where you kids be
I'm still leaving you fucked up, Disney
Pixar, you ain't think we make it this far
It's hard, imagine my defeat, bizarre
Play this beat on loop, what's the scoop?
Cno, Li, mic, add beats, musical soup

[Cno Evil]
Listen up, this is how The Chip Monk flow
I got that 'true blood' but it's not HBO
Hip hop 'survivor', no reality show
Flawless fatality, I got the mentality though
The Rodentz are raps endangered species, struggling
To find a wide audience, please believe me
Vincent Valentine, 'Spit Again', just one more time
A couple of more rhymes with a handful of lines
Mickey Grouch, got that punch for your mouth
In other circles they might just call him Mouse
I'm known as Johnny Green Eyes to a select few
For this mixtape presentation we gon' select Wu
We the summer blockbusters, you a box office bomb
Listen on, this is how I'm known to rip songs
Burn a copy, and hand them out throughout White Plains
Play it in your car, listen hard, is the right thing
Clint Eastwood Cno, Gran Torino Evil
Ninenty-nine percent of what you say is illegal
Reminding you, of the darkness in the world
Run up in the club and just snatch your girl
We The Rode Warriors, we don't fucking play around
All these other so-called rappers trying to get down
But they Internet sounds, sound all fucked up
'Take five' MC's, give 'em a little bit of luck
Johnny Depp on the microphone, the 'Public Enemy'
Death to those who oppose and offend me

[Chorus 2X]

[Li-Mouse]
Stupid, this technique is unmatched
Egg me on, but ya'll are still unhatched
We got it like that, fiction, fact
Embrace for the impact, contact
We the bogeys locked up on your six
The damage is extensive, you could not fix
This or that, you know I blast cats
Trying to suck my blood like vampire bats
Cno and I emerge from the dark
Moses carrying no tablets but the All-Spark
Bumblebees be buzzing with the sound of 'Jazz'
I walk around not giving a fuck what he has

[Cno Evil]
And what he has is bad for rap
Who's to blame, for the sorry state of this crap?
I'm 'bored' of these 'games', put you in the 'Mouse Trap'
Chilling in my tree, with a Chip N Dale laugh
Mickey is the boss, you've seen him on South Park
Fucked up the Jonas Brothers and leave 'em to starve
Dying more times than that Kenny kid
Fuck this shit, Kanye West still a gay fish

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
