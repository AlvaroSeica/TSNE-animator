Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus: Fredo Santana]
Man I gotta get this money, Ion' know about chu
Maaan I can't trust these bitches, Ion' know about chu
Man I'm going to the top, Ion' know about chu
Maaan Ion' fuck with ops, Ion' know about chu
Ion' know about chu, Ion' know about chu
Ion' know about chu, Ion' know about chu
Ion' know about chu, Ion' know about chu
Ion' know about chu, Ion' know about chu

[Verse 1: Fredo Santana]
I come from the streets, that's why street niggas feel me
And I know I did a lot to make niggas wanna kill me
If I told you what I did I know you won't believe me
Growing up in the Chi man I swear ain't one easy
I speak real street shit, real street shit from the heart
I done came a long way from selling niggas out the lot
I done sold a lot of cocaine at my back door
How many times the police kick my shit, about four
I done did a lot of dirt, I done sold a lot of work
Just to take the pain away I just pour another four
N'other four, I just pour another four
Just tot take the pain away I just pour another four

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Capo]
Gotta get the guap and leave you stay bro', don't know about chu
All of these hoes wanna be up in my business, wanna know what I do
Just me &amp; Fredo
Going to smoke, and lets hit Tadoe
Goin on the same song, got some Glocks for a nigga lay low
If you want pure drama, smoke him &amp; his mama
All around my [?]
[?] I got her
Homeboy I flexed your bitch [?]
And I just wanna talk [?]
[?]
And I gotta do all my Glocks if you got any problems
Fuck nigga don't stand in my face, won't you wanna say sumthing?
Niggas ain't tryna talk to me tho', if it ain't about no money

[Chorus]</pre>
