[Ice-T]
Ban me, try it, you might cause a riot
But the radio won't play the underground we supply it
I'm an Emcee pirate, this loud not quiet
Radical is what they make them, make a rule out they fight
Critics may say I'm wise, some of them call my words lies
I have lived more than one day, than they willing their lives
Cops hate kids and kids hate cops
Cops kill kids with warning shots
What is crime and what is not?
What is justice?, I think I forgot 
Squeeze the Trigger, 1986
Ain't a damn thing changed motherfucker</pre>
