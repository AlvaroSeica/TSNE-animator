Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
Do you remeber? we was outside (side), deep in the sky feelin' oh so fly
Do you remeber, these were the ghetto days (these were the ghetto days)
Do you remeber? we was outside (side), deep in the sky feelin' oh so fly
Do you remeber, these were the ghetto days (these were the ghetto old days)

Do you know, the one reason why we get so high
Is the same reason why we try to get by
With the family in the (way)
And the butter in the (way)
I'll just make way ti'll we back together again (come to me)
I gotta keep on chasin' the game
Reppin' my name
Stack my cheese right before I get small den
I just try to try to stay above the water
These dudes are trying to get me that's why I don't need a lighter (hey yes)
Pullin' me down, draggin me round', making me drown
They hold up in your mouth blou
Lay back! (lay back, lay back, lay back)
Marinated upon the good old days (well I remember)

[Chorus]
Do you remeber? we was outside (side), deep in the sky feelin' oh so fly
Do you remeber, these were the ghetto days (these were the ghetto days)
Do you remeber? we was outside (side), deep in the sky feelin' oh so fly
Do you remeber, these were the ghetto days (these were the ghetto days)

There be bill, we'll be chillin' outside
Reminiscing bout the music that we once played
It went, la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la
There be bill, we'll be chillin' outside
Reminiscing bout the music that we once played
It went, la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la

[Chorus]
Do you remeber? we was outside (side), deep in the sky feelin' oh so fly
Do you remeber, these were the ghetto days (these were the ghetto days)
Do you remeber? we was outside (side), deep in the sky feelin' oh so fly
Do you remeber, these were the ghetto days (these were the ghetto days)</pre>
