Typed by: kandi_4ever@hotmail.com

I've been watching

Come on baby let me kick a little with you
Baby, baby let me kick a little game with you
(repeat again)

I've been watching you watching me
And I know you want it
Come on let me kick a little game with you

Laying against the wall checkin' out the scenery
All I see is everybody trying to get with me
So I continue to play it crazysexycool
Lost all composure when I laid my eyes on you

1 - 	You just wanna know if you can kick come game
	Come with something more clever than just your name
	See it's like this I wanna take you home
	But you gotta show me that your game is on

2 - 	I've been watching you watching me
	And I know you want it
	But it depends on how you kick your game

Repeat 2

Come on let me kick a little game to you

I've been waiting for a dose of your personality
See I'm in the mood and if all goes right
Baby you will be, you will be going home with me tonight

Miss Left Eye
All I wanna do is kiss your hand
Let you know I'm not just another fan I am the man
And I don't give a damn about who you know
I got a 48-track studio back at the crib
So drop by you know where I live
I see you all the time but on another note
Would you like to dance?
Nah, I'm about to go and uh hang my coat

Repeat 2

Lisa Lopez
It's been a month
I called you twice...You called me once
Baby come with me you'd be mine
So we can make love on the 50 yard line
You for me, me for you
There's nothing in this world you know we couldn't do
Yeah but who was that girl all on your back...

Nicole
I'm just a nigga that followed you to the coat rack

Repeat 1
Repeat 2

Come on let me kick a little game with you
Baby, baby let me kick a little game to you
