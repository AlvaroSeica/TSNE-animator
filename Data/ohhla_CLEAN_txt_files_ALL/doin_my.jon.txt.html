[Chorus: x2]
I'm over playin these games
I keep hopin that you change
All you do is lead me on
Things will never be the same
So now I'm doin my thang
I don't care what you gon' say
You actin like you give a shit
But you never loved me anyway

You never loved me anyway
So now I'm doin my thang
Sick of all these games
Somethings gotta change
So now I'm fixin my life
Cause I can't take you no more
I do love you girl you got me so torn

One minute its I don't need you
Next minute don't leave me ever
Girl I'm goin insane
Every other day its a different thang
So what am I supposed to do about this
Kick back and never ever get pissed
Well now I can't do this anymore
So you betta turn around and head for the door
I done put up wit ya so long
After you done did me so wrong
But I still care for you girl
I'm sick and tired
So you gotta get the hell on
Its kinda fucked up how
You treated me like you did
I gave you everything I had
And you never gave me shit
From the jump I stood in the corner
From the jump you was quick to diss me
I had your back through it all
When you turned your back when I called
Which you quick to run to your friends
You shut me out and let them in
Even though I was there before them
But fuck them

[Chorus]

I know what you gon say
You finna beg me to stay
Despite how hard its gon be
I gotta just get away
Cause I ain't happy here
Although im so in love
It just ain't enough
This shit is just too tough
I tried to make it work
All you do is make it worse
I'm over all of the pain
I'm done with all of the hurt
You can be with him
Girl you can do whateva
I won't be waitin no more
And it ain't just how was before
I swear I'm over this shit
You done pushed me too far
So now I'm gone
Its too bad
Girl I'm done being sad
Waitin around for ya call
When you ain't even plannin on callin
No more I'm done with this shit
Peace out
I'm through with this story

[Chorus]

You never loved me anyway
So now I'm doin my thang
Sick of all these games
Somethings gotta change
So now I'm fixin my life
Cause I can't take you no more
I do love you girl you got me so torn

[Chorus]</pre>
