[Lil' Rob]
(Verse 1)
It's the gangsta, M-E-X-I-C-A-N, back
With the rhyme, that'll blow your mind, that you wanna hear again
Because you can't get enough of the
Brown crowd, that is so rough and so tough
Crazy, bad, wicked, the worst
And when I'm through
When I rewind a verse
So you could go ahead and try to put me down
But I was told, "Don't let no one get you down, and never wear a frown"
It's Lil' Rob the Chicano
And proud one
Competition none (None...)
{*beat stops*}
But wait, I'm not done {*beat resumes*}
Fuckin' it up like this, especially for the brown 
So orale, suvale in the brown side of town
Don't be shy
Bump that shit, homie
And Sir Crown, why don't you mix in the oldie
The hay'll keep the shit bouncin'
I got the jealous vato's talent, cause I got the heinas shoutin' over
Lil' Rob
One of many Mexicano poets
But not sayin' that I'm king
Down for the brown, I'll show it cause I know it is
The brown crowd vida, esta loco thing
And I'm the Mexican gangsta
Born with the badness
You think you could rap, bitch, you still can't fuckin' match this
A little vato goin' for the gusto
It's called the brown crowd, just thought I'd let you know, so
Listen to the sounds of the brownest
And you will find
Chicano sounds are the downest
Cause we don't fuck around and that
You should know
Brown crowd
With the sounds of the brown for the barrio
Should I say, "I'm back," or should I say that I'm still here
Sounds of the brown is soundin' good to my ear
We are gettin' down, see, you might as well admit it
And if you're talkin' shit, then you might as well quit it
The Mexican Gangster havin' an "Oh What A Night"
Partying in my city and everything is alright
I'll get with Mary Jane, cause she's my crazy love
I'm havin' fun, but the night ain't done, it's time for the hit and run
But you best believe I'm brown and proud
Brown and proud
It's called the Brown Crowd

[Lil' Rob]
Fuck yeah

Chorus: Sir Crown
"Brown, crowd, Chicano, we're proud, and proud to be brown"
"Got the brown crowd, got the, got the brown crowd"
"Brown, crowd, Chicano, we're proud, and proud to be brown"
"Got the brown crowd bumpin' loud..." --&gt; Lil' Rob

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 2)
I don't usually tear this competition
But when I hear some bad ass shit, I got to represent myself
Better
Cause I can't let a
Silly soca
Think he could rap better than me
So I get a
Firme style
That you gotta rewind
Chicano sounds are the downest you will find
When it comes to a rolla, brown crowd controla
How do you know, because Lil' Rob told ya
Comin' straight from the man with the wicked mind
All the time, comin' out with sick and twisted rhymes
But at the same time
I got the heinas meltin'
With the crazy love, slow rappin'
I got the vatos mad, because I got the heinas shoutin'
I don't give a shit cause jealousy will never quit
It never seems to amaze
All the tension I raise, and for this, I get paid
Ask me if I care and I'll say, "No"
Ask me if I've changed, I'm still the same kid from the barrio
But there's one point that I have to make
See, if you ask somebody shit, you gotta ask
Me
Cause there's too many rumors going around 
About Lil' Rob and the crowd that's brown
Heinas sayin' I'm conceited, but I don't need it
I'm callin' you a fuckin' mensa if you want to believe it
So it's like
You got your own choice, mija
Without fans
I wouldn't be nothin', so you know I need ya
I started rappin' now, people don't let me live
Some people don't want me, livin' their threats is what I'm given
I don't know why cause I think I'm a nice guy
Sometimes mad, most of the time, on my Natural High
And if you know me
You know that's how I am
It's called the brown crowd, the life of this Mexican

Repeat Chorus Twice

(Verse 3)
Back with verse three, so
Let me kick it
I'm gonna make it quick, sly, slickful, wicked
To let you know, otra vez, that I won and they lost
If you find me repeating something, it's to get my point across
To get my point across, to get my point across
To all you levas
Who couldn't catch it
You can't match it
Even though you try to snatch it
A style
From a little vatos, who won't let go
Of a flow, smooth, suavacito
And to you rappers who say I can't rap
I'm passin' you up, with the quickness, cause you're on my shitlist
You see, I know what I'm doin', ese
But only if you knew, holmes, what I'm gonna do, holmes
Trip out, as I go on
With the funky flow, as I flow
Flow
Flow on
I'm droppin' competition to the floor
Because I got more bounce
Much more
So let me fuck it up for the gente
As I'm rappin' bottoms up on a Presidente
Cause there's a party in the town tonight
But am I through, shit, not quite
Hmm
Yeah, holmes
The brown crowd's the best
This jam is called the Brown Crowd, now wait for the rest
