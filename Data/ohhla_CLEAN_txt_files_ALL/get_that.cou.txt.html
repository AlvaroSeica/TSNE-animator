Song:   Get That Monkey Off Your Back
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

"I'm supposed to be draggin my foot, out your motherfuckin ass"

[Chorus One]
Get that monkey off your back {*2X*}
Get that monkey {*2X*}
Get that monkey off your back {*3X*}
Get that monkey {*2X*}
Get that monkey off your back

[Chorus Two: repeat 2X]
Get that monkey off your back boy
Get that monkey off your back girl
Get that monkey off your back

[Boots]
You know it ain't for us
You know they thank we dangerous
Even with no thangs to bust
They wanna keep puttin chains to us
That's why I constantly sang and cuss
And when I bring it it's a gang of fuss
They tryin to send us out to bang for bucks
They must be off of that angeldust; so check it out

[Chorus One] + [Chorus Two]

[Boots]
I'm an instigator
Mashin out or in the scraper
And you can listen at me now or later
But stop givin them pimps your paper
Used to be caught up in them capers
Havin to hustle, rustle up my status
They beat my yellow ass purple like the Lakers
More like the Clippers cause they tryin to fade us; now holla wit me

[Chorus One] + [Chorus Two]

[Boots]
Aight we finally gots new momentum
Let's fill the fridge up in the kitchen
It's lotsa pots for cookin D-boy chicken
But we still ain't got one to piss in
They say I'm always fittin the description
Of selling unprescribed prescriptions
But it's them with the green addiction
Think we gon' have to shake 'em off and keep dippin; so sing along

[Chorus One] + [Chorus Two]

"Get your foot off my neck!" {*4X*}</pre>
