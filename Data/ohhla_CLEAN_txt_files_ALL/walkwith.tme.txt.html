it all happened at once right out of the blue
its a thing called thing jealousy inspired from you
it took a shade of yellow, and my face out of breath
the color was green, envy was all that was left
I know its a waste of time, but it's all my watch says
if I didnt write it away, i'd probably be dead
you could call me a coward, you could call me weak
I won't disagree with either, just let me speak
my pen is the liquid (baby), my paper is the tree
music is my voice, my thoughts set me free
you don't have to listen, just don't interrupt
let me say what I have to say till my time's up
I don't know if it makes sense, maybe a couple quarters
insanities not my friend, he's just a supporter
and I'ma give you a call when I figure it out
but until then stop asking me what my songs are about

come on come on, just sing with me
it don't matter what it means just sing with me
come on come on, just dance with me
it don't matter where we dance just dance with me
come on come on, just talk to me
it don't matter what we say just talk to me
come on come on, just walk with me
it don't matter where we go just walk with me

it all happened at once right out of the green
a thing called envy inspired from me
I stomped it out with a little bit of logic
thought I lost it, but smiled and called it progress
I don't really know what this pens trying to say
but its been speaking to me since the 8th grade
I got angels writing through me and demons writing to me
and ive seen one too many luis bunuel movies
and when my TV breaks I'ma stare at the light bulbs
and look for my angel, she'll be the white moth
I'ma be that cockroach in a cocoon
thats gonna come out and be something better then you
and all you caterpillars, trying to be butterflies
you'll get your wings, but you'll fly like the other guys
and I'ma give you a call when I figure it out
but until then stop asking me what my songs are about

come on come on, just sing with me
it don't matter what it means just sing with me
come on come on, just dance with me
it don't matter where we dance just dance with me
come on come on, just talk to me
it don't matter what we say just talk to me
come on come on, just walk with me
it don't matter where we go just walk with me

come on come on come on little lady
I'ma take you to this place where the lakes are gravy
the rivers are wine and the clouds mashed potato
you could chase your dreams and your friends won't say no
god is not a doctor and your prayers arent hospitals
all you got is thought your bodies not an obstacle
the colors are ten times your eyes could imagine
and the happiness is nothing cartoons could fathom

(Amber)
it's fantastic, it's fantastic
the place is fantastic its my reality
put away your telescopes its not in this galaxy</pre>
