[1st Verse]
If you asked me my position, I'd tell you that I'm a worker
Everyday 9 to 5 and I don't really see a purpose
I'm starting to feel worthless
My dreams is getting further
If I flip another burger, imma go commit a murder
My teachers used to tell me; I got a lot of potential
And if I used my brain, then I'd probably end up successful
But it's not really that simple
They should've told me the truth
'Cuz every genius that lived was once considered a fool
And every brother that tried, the same brother that died
I'm tryna stay sober, but I'll end up getting high
That's my only way to cope, while I'm slowly losing hope
Society is a joke and politics is a hoax
I'm holding onto this pain that's really straining my brain
They say we all equal
But look what they did to people
And they say they gave us freedom, but I still feel like a slave
Trapped inside a cage, moving from day to day

[Chorus]
Feeling like I'm running in a circle 'cuz this life could really hurt you
If you're lost and you cant figure your way
I'm feeling no emotion, losing focus, taking notice
But I'm hoping I could change and make a better today
I'm feeling like I'm dying but I'm trying to survive
By getting by in an environment that destined to lose
I'm tryna keep my head up, get my bread up.
But I'm fed up. If I let up, no idea the next move imma do

[2nd Verse]
If you asked me my position, I'd tell you that I'm a mother
That's lonely living single, raising children in the gutter
Not the life that I envisioned, but I ain't making excuses
Everyday's another challenge. I'm just tryna find a balance
Every year I get older, my heart is growing colder
Baby father's in jail, but the kids think he's a soldier
And it's hard to find love, when you don't know where to search
And it's hard to find a God when you never been to church
So some call me a stripper, others call me a sinner
But the names don't really matter when I'm tryna pay for dinner
And I wanna go to school, but can't really find the time
Between these doctors appointments and sitting waiting in line
Rent, food and pampers
And my parents? Oh yeah, they died from cancer
I guess that I'm just young and living reckless
But I gotta take my chances
'Cuz I got a lot of questions
But can't seem to find the answer

[Chorus]
Feeling like I'm running in a circle 'cuz this life could really hurt you
If you're lost and you cant figure your way
I'm feeling no emotion, losing focus, taking notice
But I'm hoping I could change and make a better today
I'm feeling like I'm dying but I'm trying to survive
By getting by in an environment that destined to lose
I'm tryna keep my head up, get my bread up.
But I'm fed up. If I let up, no idea the next move imma do

[Bridge]
Uh, Uh
Yeah, Yeah
Uh, Yeah
Uh, Yeah

[Chorus]
Feeling like I'm running in a circle 'cuz this life could really hurt you
If you're lost and you cant figure your way
I'm feeling no emotion, losing focus, taking notice.
But I'm hoping I could change and make a better today
I'm feeling like I'm dying but I'm trying to survive
By getting by in an environment that destined to lose
I'm tryna keep my head up, get my bread up.
But I'm fed up. If I let up, no idea the next move imma do</pre>
