Yea, that's what I'm talkin' about, all day

[HooK: Nashawn]
Just look at his watch, just look at his Range
Just look at his glock, just look at his slang
Wow, all my ladies go, wow

Just look at his watch, just look at his Range
Just look at his glock, just look at his slang
Wow, all my ladies go, wow

[Verse One: Nashawn]
When it comes to these women, they wanna ride wit me
It could mean, she gon' gettin' killed, she wanna die wit me
Anythin' to lie wit me, keep her high wit me
But not as high as Whitney and Bobby, wow
Love her style, she keep a doobie wrapped up or when she let it down
Every girl in town wanna be her now
She use to stay in the hood, now she won't be around
Wow, feel well, some of my old squeezes, I got some new pieces
Icin' out the head of Jesus
Lights on, on the highway, speedin'
Light rain, hyrdo in my right hand, chiefin'

[Interlude: Nashawn]
Yea, *SNIFFS* *COUGHS*

See that dyke ma ma?

[HooK: Nashawn]
Just look at his watch, just look at his Range
Just look at his glock, just look at his slang
Wow, all my ladies go, wow

Just look at his watch, just look at his Range
Just look at his glock, just look at his slang
Wow, all my ladies go, wow

[Verse Two: Nashawn]
Wow, up in the Bronx, where the people's are fresh
I had a shorty fat ass and some big ass breast
Who walk well, all my homies said, wow
We ain't seen a shorty like that in a while
Now, they know now, been knew my style
Got a Portuguese Ma, whose pussy flow like the Canal
Now, I flossed wit her through town
Hands down, all the older heads caught me
I got the baddest bitch around now

[HooK: Nashawn]
Just look at his watch, just look at his Range
Just look at his glock, just look at his slang
Wow, all my ladies go, wow

Just look at his watch, just look at his Range
Just look at his glock, just look at his slang
Wow, all my ladies go, wow</pre>
