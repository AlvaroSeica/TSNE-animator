Typed by: AZ Lyrics

My man is a bad man
But I can't deny the way he holds my hand and he grabs me
He has me by my heart

Badman, badman, yes
Badman but, ready for you
Badman, badman
Badman but, ready for you

Hey girl, you better call your man fast
So far from a quick blast
Best believe that I brought a gun in my gym bag
Just the role be grade a like six flag
Sick lag, I'm from a different world like sinbad
Once shot will pop your collar bone
Throw him in the tub, turn the shower on
Grab the chainsaw, turn the power on
We the last to stand this is the towers gone

Badman, badman
Badman but, ready for you
Badman, badman
Badman but, ready for you

I'm from a hard place of shootouts, car chase
Play the bar late with guns in guitar case
Know the gun stampede, annoyed like them scarface
Cameras everywhere, snatch his kids, make his month pay
You won't find where the bomb placed
Silly rabbit running in the wrong race
Iced out bullets on charm brace
Feds everywhere, like the dogs wait
Wait

Badman, badman
Badman but, ready for you
Badman, badman
Badman but, ready for you

My old man is a tough man
But he got a soul as sweet as blood-red jam
And he shows me he knows me
Every inch of my tar-black soul

It's like that
Oh yea, it's like that
I take the mike back like you know what I'm nice at
Catching my knight black, you dare, when I fight back
I'm put a check on his hand like a knight cap
Showroom floor, bit in luxury, foreign driven
Where I'm from I've seen more dead people than morticians
Politic and more way, bring more shitmas
More minutes playing every game, no forfeiting
Before leaving this big old nut
Closed willy burgers so I'll be in the jimbo spot
Just leaving the carwash, got the windows locked
Riding up and down harlem like I did those blocks
I kid you all not, I'm ready to win
They letting me in, I'm starting to feel like jeremy linn
Reintroduced to dudes like they don't remember me then
I hardly win, I smile with a felony grin
Vado

My man is a bad man
But I can't deny the way he holds my hand and he grabs me
He has me by my heart

Badman, badman
Badman but ready for you
Badman, badman
Badman but ready for you</pre>
