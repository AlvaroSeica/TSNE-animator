[Meek Mill]
R.I.P to my lil' nigga Snupe... yeah

Yeah, we the realest niggas in this shit, pullin' live out of Philly
Young nigga love poppin' bad bitches and wheelies
And I'm talkin' all this money, now these niggas can't feel me
Money long, team strong so these niggas can't kill me - AHHH~!
I get a rush from this lifestyle
Solid gold presidential with the ice dial
When the Chasers in the building turn the lights down
Cause every single nigga with me gon' be iced out
Block party, livin' life wild
I go to court for probation and lookin' like trial
The DA told me she want a nigga but right now
I'm livin' better than ever, I'm thinkin' like "How?
Is it the money? Is it the cars?
Is it the way a nigga livin' that took me this far?"
But still they want me with the sins and give me them bars
They lock a nigga in the dark, I still look like a star
I shine, I grind harder, I'm workin' my mind smarter
I take care of my grandmama, mama, my ma's daughter
They tellin' me I ain't shit, I made it for my father
I just hope you pray for me, matter fact sing for me

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Lil' Snupe - they killed my lil nigga Snupe
My lil nigga was the truth
And all he wanted was a coupe, all he wanted was a coupe
So what's a nigga 'sposed to do?
Tell 'em put the guns down or tell these lil niggas shoot?
Cause they'll do the same to me, do the same shit to you
And all these niggas in my roof
That's why I got a bulletproof

[Meek Mill]
As I'm rollin' through my city, nigga, all I see is murder
Ain't nobody seen it but shit everybody heard it
And ain't nobody hiring so everybody servin'
And all this gunfire and shit everybody murkin - better get a strap!
Young niggas sellin' caine just to get it back
And they bustin' out them racks till they sittin' back
And if a nigga hit my homie, we gon' hit him back
And if you send him over here, know we gon' send him back
My flow iller, I came up from dope dealin'
I been sayin' I'd make it, they telling me no
Nigga these voices all in my head just tellin' me go get it
I came up on four wheelers; bananas and gorillas through the jungle
where killers rumble and everyone perishin'
Realest nigga in it no comparison
And they got the nerve to tell me I'm arrogant
But what the fuck, I'm young, black, I made it in America
So I'mma ball harder than the mu'fuckin' +Carter's+
+BeyoncÃ© and Shawn+, arm +Blue'er+ than their daughter
Maneuver through the water like a shark that's on a dolphin
Nigga darker, in a coffin devils on him, get em off him - AHHH~!
I can look at your homies and tell you foul, dawg
Leanin' with your left but you stand in southpaw
Be the same niggas that'll take you out, dawg
Leavin' niggas hungry but you eatin' Mr. Chows, dawg
Where the love at? Where the love at?
I'll give up all this money to get lil cuz back
Before my nigga go starvin' like where the grub at
Give up the fame, start over and get my buzz back
Do it again, murder his killer him and his friend
Put the arena, step on the stage, kill him again
Look at the stands, the fans coming fillin' them in
to give my nigga a chance, see him winnin' again

[Chorus]

[Meek Mill]
Real nigga for life...
Real nigga for life...
Real nigga for life, they killed my lil nigga Snupe...
They killed my lil nigga Snupe...
