[Intro: Crisis]
The best to do it...
You think it's a game? It's real life...
Handle life and spit it wicked...

[Crisis]
One of the best to do it, Sharpshooter flow fluent
Send niggaz back to the lab, your flow needs improvement
Pressure busts pipes, not Black Knights
Makes me react like two fiends fighting for crack in the crack pipe
I'm an addict for static with habits of letting niggaz have it
I'm hot with a passion for smashing niggaz like Ronnie Lott
Will they live to tell the tale? Probably not
I'm throwing more than a karate chop
The K'll make ya body flop
Like a fish out of water, leave ya click out of order
Hit ya hood headquarters, cause a martyr, they slaughter
To defeat or compete with the Knights
You gotta be sharper than blades
Smarter than AIDS, howl darker than caves

[Rugged Monk]
Monk's slow flow is so unique, I'm still a voice for the street
Creative charisma, sharp, on point with the beat
Speak nothing but truth, write nothing but facts
Don't act like the Knights don't influence your raps
How the fuck you gon' doubt something that you wanna be
When your thoughts and battery package is energized by me
Still you wanna buy the lie like you better than me
If you don't knock it off before your block I'll be knocking off
Monk's known to pop it off, stay hot up in the zone
Snatch the king up off his throne, patrol the hood with the chrome
Step and get blown, to whoever it may concern
It's my turn, my night, Every Night's a Black Knight
If you didn't know, wrote about it, like to hear it
Here it go, you won't last and eight bars can't compete, it's sixteen
I don't wanna battle you, I wanna serve your whole team
Get it over quick, nigga, cuz I love doing this

[Chorus: Rugged Monk]
Black Knights attack with swords, protect your juggular
Trying to guard your neck, two darts already dug in ya
The Knights attack with swords, protect your juggular
Trying to guard your neck, two darts already dug in ya</pre>
