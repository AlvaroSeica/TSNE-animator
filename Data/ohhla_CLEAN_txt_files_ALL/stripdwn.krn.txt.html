(*talking*)
Whoo, it's almost bout that time
Man see what's going on, they out there tonight
That's why I'm staying inside, haha
Man what's taking this girl so long, shoulda been here
Uh oh there she go, pulling in the driveway haha
Hey what's up, yeah hey remember what we talked about huh
Still gon' do it huh, don't get scared I got ya come on

[K-Rino]
Come inside relax your mind, if your guards wanna come down just let em
You got too many layers on you baby girl, it's time to shed em
No need for shyness, it's our secret come on let me peep it
That you can keep it, I'm just trying to see what's underneath it
Strip down yeah, take all of that outside hatred off
And all that pain of past relationships, girl take that off
I start to wonder what new dimension could you be from
The more it comes off you, the more attractive you become
Just free yourself from all the drama, and the craziness
And baby yes, undress from all that daily stress
Don't be self conscious, I just wanna help reveal you
But the best way I can feel you, is if you show me the real you
The one who's mind prism's, in a state of neverlissm
Not the one that's putting up, those mental defense mechanisms
And as I look at you, I see you physically defined
But I'm not trying to strip your body down, I'm trying to strip your mind

[Chorus - 2x]
Strip down queen, come and take that pressure off
Don't be reserved, open up let me undress your thoughts
You got the good parts, covered up with years of hurt and strife
Throw all that on the floor, expose yourself to me tonight

[K-Rino]
It was cool, that we had built enough unity
The point whether revealing of her true nudity, beautifully included me
I use to be the dude, who would use and maneuver foolishly
And ruthlessly pursued women, until they moved elusively
And then I met you, and knew that there was more to
A woman than the physical, that was meant two rounds of sore through
When you walked into my door, your mind was fully clothed
Now I need you to disrobe, until you're fully exposed
Take your time, let it slip off of you bit by bit
You got a wall around you, I'ma get rid of that brick by brick
Let's set the music, what we do will be exclusive
Not to be intrusive, but to remove it is therapeutic
You can do it, I know your whole life you been through it
This conversation we're having is fluent, man I knew it
That madness that you're wearing, I need to see it unfastened
Underneath that hurtful fabric, was the woman that I imagined come on

[Chorus]

[K-Rino]
Strip down from low self esteem, move away from that
Your natural eyes are beautiful, you don't need no colored contacts
See girl you make the planet turn, we both got a lot to learn
You ain't got no perm, but I still love your hair I'm not concerned
Self doubt emotional scars, you just can't take no more
Why you wearing make up, you ain't got no flaws to make up for
I'ma listen to your problems, burn every bad item up
Take off that piece, that said your skin tone wasn't light enough
Old emotional clothes, left you colder than the North Pole
Once you part with those, I'ma give you a whole new wardrobe
There she go, look at her she so attractive to me
Look in that mirror, what you witnessing is natural beauty</pre>
