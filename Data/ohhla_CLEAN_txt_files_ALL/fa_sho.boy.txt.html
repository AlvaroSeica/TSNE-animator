Typed by: Lil Hustle

[Hook - 2x]
We get do' (fa sho), we spit flows (fa sho)
We wreck shows (fa sho), we wreck hoes (fa sho)
We got dollas (fa sho), we pop collas (fa sho)
You wanna folla (fa sho), playa holla (fa sho)

[Chalie Boy]
I swang down, in a drop (fa sho)
Hit the breaks, but my rims don't stop (fa sho)
Screens on, and the candy paint glow (fa sho)
The long horns, looking good on the do's (fa sho)
I keep the nine cocked, and ready (fa sho)
Dead aim, cause I keep the beam steady (fa sho)
Man I'm representing, Cowd and Hurd (fa sho)
Texas, making broads head turn (fa sho)
Big Rob, Big Red and Lil Sho (fa sho)
Big Ake, Raw J in the do' (fa sho)
DJ Bull, Tite and Sir Coop (fa sho)
Don't plex, playboy you gon lose (fa sho)
Chalie Boy, is my name (fa sho)
Dirty 3rd Records, sitting on my chain (fa sho)
From a bird's eye view, I peep game (fa sho)
Free-loaders, won't get a damn thang mayn (fa sho)

[Hook - 2x]

[Chalie Boy]
I split words, in two (fa sho)
Not many, can do what I do (fa sho)
Naw cats, I do the fool on stage (fa sho)
Headliners see my name, front page (fa sho)
I keep, all the shorty's hands up (fa sho)
Sitting down, and can't help her stand up (fa sho)
All the dudes, tell you how I feel (fa sho)
Real always, gon recognize real (fa sho)
I wreck shows, and wreck flows for cash (fa sho)
Haters wanna get swoll, I'ma blast (fa sho)
Man I gotta, stay dressed to impress (fa sho)
Haters test, I can't settle for less (fa sho)
I'm G'd up, switching lanes (fa sho)
Trunk bumping, out my 4-pack sang (fa sho)
And the rims, still spinning on dubs (fa sho)
That's how it is, we in the club (fa sho)

[Hook - 2x]

[Chalie Boy]
It's big pimping, over here (fa sho)
Cris', Henn', Grey Goose and Belvedere (fa sho)
All of that, don't mean a'ything (fa sho)
Down South, we love to lean (fa sho)
H-Town and D-Town, what it do (fa sho)
Austin and San Anton', do the fool (fa sho)
Banging down to Ft. Worth, put it down (fa sho)
Waco to Long View, act a clown (fa sho)
Abalene to Odessa, on D's (fa sho)
Amarillo, on down to Concrese (fa sho)
Wichita, to Kalene on 4's (fa sho)
Thaila to Tilfa, on stop-and-go's (fa sho)
From crocker to the booth, we act bad (fa sho)
Red on the bur-blue, on a Jag (fa sho)
From Shreveport To Abaloosa, and Rustin (fa sho)
Dirty 3rd, gonna keep your head rushing (fa sho)

[Hook - 4x]
