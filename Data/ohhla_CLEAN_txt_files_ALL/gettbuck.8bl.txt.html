[ CHORUS: Eightball (2X) ]
All my niggas if you feel what I'm sayin get bucked
If some niggas wanna flex we can tear the fuckin club up
High till I die, let me hear you say it with me
Fuck a trick, buck a bitch, death to my enemy

[ VERSE 1: Eightball ]
Time to take this shit to a level many thought was dead
Recall on what I read and try to fuck up a nigga head
Not sayin 'fuck peace', but now ain't the time for that
Grab the mic and show a muthafucka where it's at
Twisted off the dope I twisted, flip and lift it
Enlisted in this hip-hop business to get them riches
Hardcore freaky bitches dig me cause I shoot much game
Fuck the fame, fuck yo name, Ball ain't lame
Aggravated, barbituates and bong hits
Mixed with V-10 clips, talent tip zipped
Cuttin wind, put a bitch life to an end
Stop yo grin, put a backhand print on yo chin
Ain't no friends in this dirty game we all play
That's why we gotta pray and thank the Lord for another day
Kill with a pen, Memphian, Babylonian
Widespread destruction as the whole world end

[ CHORUS: Eightball (2X) ]

[ VERSE 2: Eightball ]
We gets live when the beat's bumpin, smokin somethin
Lyrical homicides lead to late night body dumpin
Stumblin, bass rumblin, bitches mumblin
Thinkin they the bomb when they known for dick-fondlin
I be wonderin who can flip it like Eightball and
Rip a stage apart like I do them bitches draws, man
Pause, man, if you thinkin you can withstand
Poetic pimpin, trappin hoes like quicksand
Big man, big Ball, fuckin up all of y'all
Before I learned to crawl, dawg, I was taught to ball
Taught to get up when I fall and play them hoes
And keep that white shit out of my muthafuckin nose
Hay chiefin, definition smokin reefer
The shit I smoke ain't cheaper but it makes you think deeper
Take it how you wanna take it while I break it down, bitch
It ain't no mistakin this with that fake gangster shit

[ CHORUS: Eightball (2X) ]

[ VERSE 2: Eightball ]
Fake niggas wanna act like they got heart but they don't fool me
Drunk-ass flodgin niggas tryina get unruly
Do me and die from all the shit I be poppin
Heart stoppin, droppin bombs like the Green Goblin
Gothic prophet preachin to my lost civilization
Medication turned my sanity to sanitation
What's real, though, is how my brain create the flow
Mouth spit the flow of how the south kicked in the do'
Pulled raps like gats and told you bitches to step back
Drive-by side, nigga, ridin one of T-Mix' tracks
Spittin facts, cause fiction get the fans' attention
Agents takin pictures, buggin tryina hear me mention
Drug connections and thug connections
Hoes I had sex with and niggas I had to flex with
But I be on some 3004 shit, futuristic
Space Age Pimp shit, and ain't nothin stoppin this
