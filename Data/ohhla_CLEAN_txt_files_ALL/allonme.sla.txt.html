[Chorus: Joe Budden]
You have a problem in the hood, you good
Don't ask what it's gon' be (what it's gon' be)
Cause if I'm by your side, don't ride
Now put that all on me (put that all on me)
Cause you my brother, you safe when I'm around
My bread is yours, hit the safe when I'm around
Cause, you can always call on me
Your drama shit ever fall on me, just put it all on ME!

[Joell Ortiz]
Uhh...
The only child feelin like a brother these days
I used to run my own race, now it's a relay
So you can take it to the bank when Ortiz say
Homie you can "have it your way" when you're in BK
It's really hood where my peeps stay
I got LeBrons with the arms, D. Wades that let the heat spray
My niggaz, y'all triggers in the heartbeat
Blood thicker than water but we thicker than concrete
Uhh, so say the word and I'm near
If it's somewhere not near, I guess I'll be in the air
on the next thing smokin, hopin it was a Lear
so I can get there quick enough to get you in the clear
I'm just sittin here vibin, sippin on this Clear
(Ah, ah) Like damn I love you
Grown ass man but I ain't scared to hug you
We ride, I'm on your side like that man above you
Put it all on me

[Chorus]

[Joe Budden]
Yeah, Joey, l-look, look, look
Know that I'ma give you my all, already proved it
Any time your back's on the wall I'm down to move it
O.G.'s respect me, real niggaz honor me
Got my Bachelor's in number scams in a con degree
Faggots ain't fond of me, frequent where the monsters be
Loyalty comes first, guess I'm still an anomaly
Always give you honesty, you gained that power
Cause you down to stash the burner when you know it ain't showered
And we ain't share a moms my nigga, we shared songs
They tried to raise the bail, I was there like the bonds
When your clientele got low, that was damn fine
Without a speech I was the beach, brought you the tanline
This is a warning, they cramp yours, they cramp mine
We should've known if we both stars, who says we can't align?
And even if we see a day we come apart
The rules is still John Q, son can have my heart (heart)

[Chorus]

[Crooked I]
My nigga now, you're in the L dot B dot
The home of the sticky jars, we own it, the city's ours
We rollin in 50 cars patrollin them titty bars
Spend 20 large in the semis, ready for any charge
We on some mobster shit
No "you and me," it's "I and I," we on some Rasta shit
My A-alike, I say it like we on some conscious shit
Rock your watches, I dare niggaz to rob your shit
Cause it's death before dishonor
Our enemies best wear a vest when they step before piranhas, catch a Heckler or a llama
Nothin protect you from the drama
Cause I'ma be on point just like the edge of a katana, weapon wet you on my mama
Uh, from the Eastside to the city limits - we run it all
From the Benji flippin to the pretty women - we've done it all
Before niggaz was big as Diggy Simmons
And we still do so if you with me then my nigga listen
to this intermission

[Chorus]
