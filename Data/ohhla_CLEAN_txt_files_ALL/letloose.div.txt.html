Song:   Let Loose
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
Let loose
Put everything on a shelf
Let loose
I got my Hennessy and I see you got your Grey Goose
and if they're hating we don't care what they do
Cause you're sexy and you're rocking
You're sexy and I am watching
You're sexy girl you're rocking
You're sexy and I am watching

Baby take a day off
Get yourself a backrub
Say bye to your manager
Say hi to your bathtub
Working all these long days
You forgot to ask of
Couple ton of pay you can't even get your task of
Day time shit got you working to the bone
Just to find yourself doing more work when you're home
Love just relax leave that work alone turn on the stereo
Work it to the song

[Chorus]

I do my thing like ding dong ditch
Please don't trip
I know you ain't my girl
But we don't snitch
You know what happens next after 3 more zips that Remy turns you up...
Slow down
We can kick it on your off day
But we will never come back what will your boss say
It's off the roof and shake them pictures out the hallway
rolling up swisha's got you smoking like em all day

[Chorus]

Where are my girls at
Where are my dimes at
You bad enough to keep a working man side tracked
You had a hard week
And you wanna hit the club and party some hard beats
And I ain't made at you shout out to anklets and neck tattoos
Pretty feet hair smelling like pedale shampoo
saving up so you can party in Cancun
and send a bunch of necked pictures from the bathroom
That's alright you know I love that shit 
ou take the whole week off and you have fun with it
spontaneous, outrageous, a purse full of credit cards with the payments up

[Chorus]</pre>
