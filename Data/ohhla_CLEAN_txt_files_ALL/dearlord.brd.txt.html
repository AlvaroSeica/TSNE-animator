[ VERSE 1 ]
Dear Lord, forgive me for my sins when I fall short
I know my story's a likely story and you heard this one before
But might I try again, till it seems it's all in vain
(Trust and you'll be damned) I'll trust and wait for change
I mean this countdown really ain't no secret, believe it
When You countdown niggas ain't gon peep it
But I can't help but think about my little girls
They ain't know, so where they headed in Your new world?
This after-life/after-death bidness got me wonderin if I'm twisted
Whether be Baptist or Christian, even though mom's Jevoha Witness?
I don't think so, none of these preachers coincide
None of 'em look like Noah, Lord, they all drive these fancy rides
So who do I believe
With all these hypocrite liars who blast fiends for the green?
So tonight before I close my eyes and go to sleep
I got a demo that I want you to peep
And it goes

[ CHORUS ]
Amazing grace, how sweet a sound
To save the wretched like me
I once was lost but now I'm found
I was blind but now I see

It ain't easy
No, no

[ VERSE 2 ]
My bad association has ruined my useful habits
Wishin I could return and get it back the way I had it
But it's definitely not easy, Lord, when ( ? )
Have me soakin' in a bottle of Henny Loc hopin' that it ease me
But I've accepted my corruption
I'm under construction
Pray that it ain't too late, wait upon destruction
See, either way, we come or go
When it's over we won't even know
That's the way it should be, just start over, everywhere to go
It's easier said than done, scared for reason number one
When I was a young boy I wondered if he had a gun
Is he really that cruel, mama? She replied:
Not as long as he won't use the tool on ya; that's when I cried
So tonight before I close my eyes and go to sleep
I got a demo that I want you to peep
And it goes

[ CHORUS ]
Amazing grace, how sweet a sound
To save the wretched like me
I once was lost but now I'm found
I was blind but now I see

It ain't easy
No, no

[ VERSE 3 ]
I feel like You just testin me and it's really done got the best of me
But You caress me and pointin' me in the right direction of my destiny
And the psychic helpline
Ain't really helped mine
When I called through
And when I got they phone bill, that's when I called You
And it's easier this way cause I don't live offa he-she
Most of the time she-say, BS keep comin like a replay
Somewhat of a clich√©, feared like it was d-day
Melody be so heavenly you got more than one DJ
So tonight before I lay my head down and go to sleep
I got a demo that I want you to peep
And it goes

[ CHORUS ]
Amazing grace, how sweet a sound
To save the wretched like me
I once was lost but now I'm found
I was blind but now I see

It ain't easy
No, no</pre>
