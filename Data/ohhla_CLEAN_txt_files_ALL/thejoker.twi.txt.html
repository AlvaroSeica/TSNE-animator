Some people call me the space cowboy, yeah
Some call me the gangsta of love
Some people call him Paulie
Cause I speak with a competence of love

People talk about me baby
They say I'm doing you wrong, doing you wrong
Don't you worry baby, don't worry
Cause I'm right here, right here, right here, right here at home

I'm a picker, I'm a grinner
I'm a lover and I'm a sinner
I play my music in the sun
I'm a joker, I'm a smoker
I'm a midnight toker
I get my lovin' on the run, ooh, oooh

*Scratches*
The joker, the joker
The, the, joke-joke, the, the joker
The joker, the joker
The, the, joke-joke, the, the joker

You're the cutest thing that I ever did see
Really love your peaches, wanna shake your tree
Lovey dovey, lovey dovey, lovey dovey all the time
I'll sure show you a good time

I'm a picker, I'm a grinner
I'm a lover and I'm a sinner
I play my music in the sun
I'm a joker, I'm a smoker
I'm a midnight toker
I get my lovin' on the run, ooh, oooh

People keep talkin' about me baby
They said I'm doing you wrong
But don't you worry, don't worry, no, don't worry mama
Cause I'm right here at home

I'm a picker, I'm a grinner
I'm a lover and I'm a sinner
I play my music in the sun
I'm a joker, I'm a smoker
I'm a midnight toker
I get my lovin' on the run, ooh, oooh</pre>
