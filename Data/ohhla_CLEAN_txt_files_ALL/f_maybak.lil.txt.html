[Intro]
I'm a tell you who I know, I know Lil B
I know the BasedGod, I'm a tell you couple moe people
That I know that's not very important
If it ain't Lil B, if it ain't the basedgod I don't care no moe
I don't wanna know, fuck em I'm a tell you somethin

[Verse]
Bitch, this is myspace (FUCK OFF!)
Tell you bout my place (SUCK MY DICK!)
The ho suck my dick cause I had a fuckin migraine
56 bitches suck my dick cause I'm John Wayne
Went to the party left out in the maybak
25 stacks for the engine can you pay that
Everybody know that the Glock push ya fade back
My names Lil B you can call me pass-a-jack
Suckas stole my money Stupid Bitch, you can take that
I'm a fuckin scrape that
Catch me at the race track
Bettin on a horse in a New Oakland A's hat
Live by the code and I never will break that
Nigga wanna rob me I'm a have to shake that
I'm a show you who the fuckin' bitch I don't play that
Under 25 and I'm flexin new maybak
Bitch kiss my ass and I know you suckas hate that
Young BasedGod My bitches suck my Dick

Fuck em! Fuck me! (I'm Excellent)
Fuck these bitches!
This is good, I'm a tell you what's real
This is real, this raw</pre>
