Yeah, yeah, huh, c'mon, ha, yeah
This is like a holiday you can celebrate
And if life got you down it's to elevate
Lift your spirits up, make you feel hella great
Put the pedal to the metal and accelerate
This'll put you on the road on the right path
It's Ace and Ed, you done met up with a tight staff
I could do this in my sleep, this is like math
This is in my blood, I used to write graph
And I still write with style, I been doin this awhile
If I tell you when I started this you might laugh
And it's been a windin road like a bike path
But I'm still so cold, you a slight draft
Such a bad motherfucker kinda like Shaft
"Shut your mouth~!" This is just the first half
And we still got two more quarters
Take a passport to cross a few more borders
Let's go

[Chorus: Edo G] + (Masta Ace)
This remind me of summertime in the park
Late night, hip-hop, turn it up, in the dark
This remind me of back home off the road
Good food slow cooked, big pot on the stove
This remind me of treacherous, fearless
Cold crush, no rush, take your time, hear this
This remind me of (one) this remind me of (two)
This remind me of (three) this remind me of you

[Masta Ace]
What these cats gon' go? We done joined forces
'Bout to flip the whole game like coin tosses
Me and him, he and I, we and us, you trust
We gon' be in they ass like loincloth is
And them underground fans all gon' support this
First they saw it in the store then they all bought this
Or they got it off iTunes
Got third world nations even open off iTunes
This a way I live a track, these are harpoons
I mean these animated rhymes like cartoons
Y'all remind me of sheep, when I play it in my jeep
Y'all put me to sleep just like car fumes
Play this on your jukebox in your bar rooms
Who the best? Who the worst? All this arguin
Won't matter when the smoke clear
Hip-Hop's not dead yet, there's a little hope here
What I'm sayin on the mic sounds so clear
Kneel down now and bow like the pope here
Got our independence, and we stayin free
He and me, Ed and Ace, yup, A&amp;E...

[Chorus]</pre>
