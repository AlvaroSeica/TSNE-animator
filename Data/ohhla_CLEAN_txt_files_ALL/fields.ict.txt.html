[Intro:]
[Ice-T:] Yo Evil man, I'm tired of this shit man
         I'm ready to get the fuck out of here, you're with it?
[Evil E] Word! let's break out of here Ice, word up!
[Ice-T:] I got to go man, yo, homeboy, do you wanna go?
[Sean E] No! man
[Ice-T:] Yo, Fuck! you then man, yo E, you're with it?
[Evil E] Yo, I'm with it man..
[Ice-T:] Well, let's get the posse man, we're gonna blow this hot ??
         Fuck! these police down here man
[Evil E] Word! We don't need this
[Ice-T:] Hit the gates

[Hook: DJ Evil E]
I escaped from the Killing Field
I escaped from the Killing Field
I escaped from the Killing Field
I escaped from the Killing Field
I escaped from the Killing Field

[Verse One: Ice-T]
Here we go; I'm moving off death row
You gotta keep up hops, you can't be slow
Cause the towers are high, they got the hype gats
Check the perimeters as good, read the maps
It's night, they might not see us
Cause if they catch us out there they'll bleed us
Shoot us, kill us, dump us in a dark ditch
Clean it up, call it a gang hit
I gotta make my move cause I'm a renegade
I recognize when mind techniques are being played
It's a plot, they use to keep down another
Here comes another brainwashed brother

[Skit #1: Sean E Sean]
Yo man, it sounds like you're selling out to me
Cause I'm from the ghetto man
I'm supposed to stay in the ghetto all my life
We ain't never supposed to live here
We're black, we're supposed to be poor

[Verse Two: Ice-T]
Shut up! do you know how dumb you sound?
That mentality what keeps my people down
Nobody wants to live in an urban war
You lived there cause your parents were poor
They lived there because theirs were also
Get yourself together, hit the gate bro!

[Chorus: Ice-T]
You gotta get out! - You gotta get out! - Why?
You gotta get out! - You gotta get out! - Why?
You gotta get out! - You gotta get out! - Why?
Cause the fields are where you die!

[Hook: DJ Evil E]
I escaped from the Killing Field
I escaped from the Killing Field
I escaped from the Killing Field
I escaped from the Killing Field
I escaped from the Killing Field

[Verse Three: Ice-T]
You try to keep us gunning and running faster
But I ain't running from you, I'm running at ya
And my posse is thick about a mil' strong
Too late to make up now cause it's on
I'm the one that's got you in constant fear
I'm the nigga you should've killed last year
But you played yourself, you let me gained wealth
Now I can change the way the cards are dealt
I've schooled my homeboys, made them all understand
The tricks and twists inflicted on the Black man
How you make me think to be down?
I gotta stay around, down in the motherfucking battlegrounds

[Skit #2:Unidentified Rhyme Syndicate member]
We got the Puerto Ricans where we want them
We got the Mexicans and the Blacks where we want them
On ship that all black, we gotta kick them together
The same way we got those FUCKING Indians

[Verse Four: Ice-T]
There'll never be any good schools in the hood
There'll never be any cops that are any as good
The hospital is a great place to go to die
Real Estate is cheap, let me tell you why?
The man has got a sure fire system
An economic prison!

[Chorus: Ice-T]
You gotta get out! - You gotta get out! - Why?
You gotta get out! - You gotta get out! - Why?
You gotta get out! - You gotta get out! - Why?
Cause the fields are where you die!</pre>
