[Skinny Pimp]
North Memphis niggaz getting buck for sho
Y'all can hate but y'all bitches don't want none ho
Acting like a big trick y'all don't want none bitch
Nobody move nobody get their whig split
Gangsta shit and that baller blocking shit don't mix
Revelation is the time and I'm tryna get rich
If you hear a nigga dissing we get cheese off that
Y'all sneak dissing bitches is you fiction or fact
How you react that's how we react you'll get whacked
That's a fact if the business go down like that
Who gives a fuck about me who gives a fuck about you
My enemies diss too long so bitch move bitch move

All these niggaz in my business tryna cross me out
Some of these suckers on the radio just hating on my clout
Bitches riding a bandwagon kickin with groupie haters
A flossing to the death from you weak ass fakers

[211]
It's the 211 coming up from the back
Bucking haters down come swing me duck lay em' on his back flat
Hard as I grip my nuts up like big
Loc on a nigga AK-47 a hundred shots my nig
Hit that hater in his jizaw knock out his fucking teeth
Drunk from the Gin and the juice the nigga must've had beef
So Kingpin hold him up let me clothes hang him
Shake the body to the river then slang him
The kings of pimp and gangsta rap
Radio stations that hate don't get your ass slapped, bitch!!</pre>
