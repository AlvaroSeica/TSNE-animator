[ Verse One ]
You introduced by the nigga that let loose
The lyrical Tec 9, it's check time
for niggaz that don't respect mine
listen to the raps that we spit
all the clips get empty, never temp me
they call me barrel a/k/a the Grizly

[ Chorus until end ]
Pump this shit in yo' trunks
Make sure yo' 15's thumb</pre>
