(Chorus)  T-Pain

I gotta bunch of dollars I can spend them on her

every super women needs a superman, here I am

(Verse 1)  Rick Ross

Sight seeing, we might be in

(Chorus) T-Pain

(Verse 2) T-Pain and Nelly

(Verse 3) Rick Ross

More better, More Cheddar

I rock wit niggas like fabolous
cause to tell the truth life fabulous
but you know you look glamorous
cause them strapped heels arent for amatures
risk quiet rocky, talk like foxy
job like roxy, spark that broccoli
walk quiet ocky, that means sexy
I will save you, if you let me
fly wit me, get high as me
alot of alphabets girl ima g
time will tell, rolex watches
we show stoppers, hoes just watch us

(Chorus) T-Pain
I got a bunch of dollars I can spend them on her
now she can be my lady I can be her lover
call me on a late night get right she aint acting right
every super women needs a superman, here I am</pre>
