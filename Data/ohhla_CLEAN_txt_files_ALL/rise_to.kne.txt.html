(Kane Spoken)

Most Wanted Records is now opening up shop.
'Bout to get y'all niggas hooked on this shit.
What's up to all the fly niggas and bitches that love this gangsta shit.
You knew we wouldn't disappoint y'all.
Every hood, every project.
This from New Orleans one of the realest cities on Earth.
From the dirty south to the motherfucking world.
Kane &amp; Abel!

(Verse 1 - Kane)

Do this for the soldiers with the bourbons and lacs
High rollers smoke big weed burn cool by the pack
Watch your back New Orleans is a fool like that
Out the blue you crooked punishments choose to jack
You might see me on a cell fussing with my girl cussing
If you see me in the club it's only right we got to smoke something
Don't wanna see me on the street busting like a mad russian
Banging niggas up like percussion need to turn it or crush em
Not for nothing ladies love it when twins be rapping
Taking titties out their bra they drop their g-string
Got our own company so come to us for the D
But that depend on how royal you want the hustle to be
It depend on how ployal you want the hummer to be
Don't trick give you the first hit for free
I know you missed us now we returned to the game
Still gangstafied bitch we invented that name
Ain't about to let no snake lay me out my chains
Cause i raised the stakes and put a stain on your grave
Underestimate here's the murder advice
A straight coward be the first one to take your life
Stop hating decide to get your own game tight
Cause i ride in the morning rather ride at night
Slide my flow get dough like Leo Dicaprio
Play your watch out gangster the rap Vito

(Chorus)

Illegal business controls America
Gonga business controls America
Cocaine business controls America
Illegal business controls America
(Kane &amp; Abel)

Who got the D (We got the D)
Who got the D (We got the D)

(Verse 2 - Abel)

Sleep-walking with a tech-nine respect my mind
Mr. Able, Mr. Kane make your life rewind
Seek and find anger in the words of my breath
If you can find danger after every step
Run a mile with death and see who win the fucking race
Sexy bitches get excited when they see my face
Got indicted on a case ain't stressing a bit
Boss Player pass the weed (Nigga hit this shit)
Bitch eliminate stress with sess get it off your chest
Take off your vest dance to the death
Spill blood for my beliefs cause that talk is cheap
Knock out your gold teeth when i branish the heat
Firearms stay warm like a tropical storm
If its on its on Kane &amp; Abel remain calm

(Chorus)

Illegal business controls America
Gonga business controls America
Cocaine business controls America
Illegal business controls America

(Kane &amp; Abel)

Who got the D (We got the D)
Who got the D (We got the D)

(Chorus)

Illegal business controls America
Gonga business controls America
Cocaine business controls America
Illegal business controls America</pre>
