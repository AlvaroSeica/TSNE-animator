Underdog underground give me a pound like trending topics
Hash tag grass bag Insta-gram of chronic
Cause right now we on it we on it like a dope beat
And we some ill emcees (yeah we are Quez) sweet
Well give me that heat that fire that dope
That shit that rocks the head back and forth
And Im like Ali on the ropes and competition is tired
And uninspired they need a diet
From that sugar coated pop and unnecessary beef
Even Michelle Obama want obesity to stop
Ok let me cool it
A jam like this got a nigga acting foolish
Unruly with the rudeness, but still the coolest alive
Breaking bread with my dude and we thrive
But still I microphone check one to stay alive
We got American dreams but allergic to apple pie

We make them put up their hands and make every arm extend
But the way that we MC, that's not where the story ends
We are on a mission and you might find it quite astounding
But, but but
we give 'em something to think about and make 'em wrap their minds around it

We in the time of iPads black presidents
Instagram and Foursquare mapping your residence
GPS directions and SuperPAC elections
And everybody stressing over mass destructive weapons
But a, through it we keep the art progressing
We offer lessons so check an awesome session
With Quez as your professor and Gripp is on his dean shit
So get up off the penis and get up on the deans list
We reap and sew like a Grim Reaper seamstress
Even if the seam is torn we will reweave it
Put it on the track and ad adhesive
Til black girls and bald headed horses scream we need it
Im just playing yall, Im so facetious
And so sarcastic, but still a genius
Or so I tell myself and I believe it
If you believe it to then great minds think in sink

We make them put up their hands and make every arm extend
But the way that we MC, that's not where the story ends
We are on a mission and you might find it quite astounding
But, but but
we give 'em something to think about and make 'em wrap their minds around it

If you blink you might miss it
This light speed diction or this nice weed hitting
Like a Spike Lee rendition of Radio Raheem
When hes punching the air and got them love and hate rings
We love and hate things love my moms baked beans
Hate to hear bad music such an ear raping
This is the music we bring cheers for grammar like Kelsey
When we rock a full house like Uncle Jesse
We rock it like the earthquakes in my birthplace
NASA couldn't rock it like I, on my worst day
Im versed in the word play, so let these words play
Your brain is my kickball we kick it every Thursday
Game over Wednesday Im calling it my win day
And after we kick it yall learn something Im your sensei
I sense youre in dismay lost your sense like Common
But still we educate and motivate man I promise

We make them put up their hands and make every arm extend
But the way that we MC, that's not where the story ends
We are on a mission and you might find it quite astounding
But, but but
we give 'em something to think about and make 'em wrap their minds around it</pre>
