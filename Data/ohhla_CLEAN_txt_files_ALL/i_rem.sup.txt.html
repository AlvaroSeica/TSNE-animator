[Intro]
Seems like everything is a little different now
M-Phazes, you know what I mean man
It's funny how people treat you
when they see your name on a CD or somethin
I didn't forget y'all
The ones who fronted on a nigga when I was tring to get some shine
But now the tables turn
"And it's showtime."
Hell yeah

[Chorus] [x2]
I remember rockin' shows for free, tryin' to sell a CD
Hand in hand I can't go there again
I can't forget
Dealin' with the B.S., yes the bullshit
When nobody was givin' a damn

[Verse One]
I feel like I'm in another world another place
Within the span of two years, the way they see a brother's face
Has taken a drastic change
360
Ladies and cats don't act the same
I guess that explains why my phone keeps continuously ringin', people reachin' out
Before they were deep in doubt
They didn't think I'd even amount
To be more than a battle MC with punchlines
Or rapped over mediocre beats but now it comes time
For me to explode, shine and get some love
Like Michael J. Fox, nobody knew how sick I was
But at the end of the day
It ain't even about the way I spit
It's about the bigger names that I'm associated with
The rap game is nothing more than bullshit and politics
With shady cats tryin' to squeeze ever dollar out of it
Now everybody's askin' for favors out of the blue
But I don't break my neck for anyone outside of my crew
I used to walk around the club every week feelin' foolish
Gettin' zero amount of love, tryin' to hustle my music
And local heads looked at me like I was kidnappin' they shine
Actin' like it's cool, but I know what's in the back of their minds
Cause half of the time, little motherfuckers wouldn't speak
Now they askin' me to rhyme, tryin' to slide me beats
Now everything changed
Now everyone's a little more friendlier
With hidden agendas, you don't think I remember?

[Chorus] [x2]
I remember rockin' shows for free, tryin' to sell a CD
Hand in hand I can't go there again
I can't forget
Dealin' with the B.S., yes the bullshit
When nobody was givin' a damn

[x2]
I remember (I remember)
Hell yeah (Hell yeah)
I remember (I remember)
Don't you? (Don't you?)

M-Phazes. What, what? Illmind. D-minor. 
And Muneshine. Wax Reform y'all

[Verse Two]
I'm from a place where local MCs never get applause
Unless they make music for crunk clubs and titty bars
So many people think this music biz isn't hard
So every other dummy got a label or a business card
You gotta watch these fake Barry Gordy sellin' dreams
Cause you could sign your life away, they'll walk away with everything
These clowns need to watch the bullshit they promise people
Like A&amp;R's with less power than the Amish people
"I can make you a star!"
Yeah, right I don't believe you
"Your album is coming out in March!"
Man, I'll believe it when I see it
Leave it to some companies I'll never see the light of day
But Supa is a business man, regardless, I'll find a way
And some of y'all are good cats
But my landlord and baby mom don't wanna hear about my album gettin' pushed back
I look back
Learn from my mistakes and keep makin' moves
April Fools to anybody thinkin' I'ma wait for you
I've put too much time in it to waste it on people
And have niggas holdin' me up like K-Swiss sneakers
I'm faced with deceivers every day on the regular
The norm
But I refuse to settle or conform
I came way too far to let these 15 seconds of fame slip away
It's the same shit a different day
And I ain't gon' change son
What you think, my memory's shot and I forgot where I came from?
Man

[Chorus] [x2]
I remember rockin' shows for free, tryin' to sell a CD
Hand in hand I can't go there again
I can't forget
Dealin' with the B.S., yes the bullshit
When nobody was givin' a damn

[Outro]
What? What? It's like that y'all, uh
Now, class is over. Dismissed</pre>
