1 - 	ReFugees, go 'head and do it
	Paper
	Go 'head and do it

Repeat 1 five times

Ooh, I betca' wondering how I knew
That you been tryin' to infultrate my crew
It ain't no hiding from the Flava U.
Don't get it confused, you ain't untouchable
(Go 'head and do it)
And while I been tryin' to keep my cool like a queen
(Ooh, like a queen)
Without them bringin' the naughty girl outta me
(Ooh, naughty girl outta me)

2 - 	Don't cha know I heard you tryin' to take mine
	While I shine, you're living fake lives
	Don't ya know I heard you tryin' to take mine	
	But while I shine ya lip and fake y'all styles
	All around me
	(Hata's tryin' to play La' 
	but they know that they can't take her paper)
	Go 'head and do it

Everybody talking see
Spreadin' them lies about my friends and me
They say that we're tighter than suppose to get
That's because I haven't let ya chill wit me yet
You make it hard for a girl to roll
(Ooh, girl to roll)
But make it easy so my pockets stay swol'
(ooh, pockets stay swol')

Repeat 2

[Pras]
That's right, yeah
Check it, check it, why
Check it, check it
Come on, come on 
Yo, yo
Where my fellas at?  Where my fellas at?
Where my ladies at?  Where my ladies at?

[Queen Latifah]
As I look back on my life (check it)
To get where I am I had to sacrifice
You slammed my name in your magazine
This business gets hard tryin' to stay a queen
You're checkin' for me, you need to check yourself
(Ooh, check yourself)
And be someone, not someone else
(Ooh, someone else)

Repeat 1
