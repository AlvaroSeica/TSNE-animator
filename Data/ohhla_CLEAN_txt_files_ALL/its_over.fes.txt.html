Song:   It's Over
Typed by: Cno Evil

[Chorus 2X: Fes Taylor]
When it's over, then it's over
I'm a soldier, thought I told you
I am not a rapper

[Fes Taylor]
If this the last time I ever speak through the words of a song
Yo, my love for the game is gone, it's all wrong
Most of these niggas is lame, think he a boss
Bigger the chain, memory lane, snitching ya brain
Foolish emotions, I'm the coolest I wrote this
Thinking changing the game is fucking hopeless
How a hip hop vocalist, get large on some Oprah shit
Say his life clean like a sober bitch
No morals, they ain't even loyal to they brother
Won't trust they mother, brought a gun to supper
I'm like I'm no sucker, nigga, I'm no rapper
Fuck the camera, act like I won't clap ya
I'm a throwbacker, Taylor 56 jersey
You got no swagger, I'm a dough stacker
Holla at papi, I got a plan
Cop atleast the weight of my chain, homey, a hundred grand
Son sounding nice, but he spit all kinda shit
He ain't never did in his life, think I'm kidding right?
Tell 'em bout the chains taken, publicity stunts
To make it look like he ain't faking
Nah, beef to make money, if it's beef
Looking like Elmer Fudd and Bugs Bunny, nigga, that's funny
He trying to get his come up on
But I ain't the type of nigga that you run up on
Nah, you like a fiend just looking for a hit
Now it's time for a long ride, took 'em on a trip
It's over, nah, just the beginning of the ending
That nigga ain't real, he just pretending
Music business, full of bitch niggas
Terrible intentions, real niggas in federal prisons
Mama a chicken head, she inherited extensions
She was raised, scoop a nigga on 20 inches
I sat and hustle on the benches
Trying to put a hundred thousand away
Cuz I ain't got a pension</pre>
