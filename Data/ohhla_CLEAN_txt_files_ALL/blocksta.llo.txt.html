[Intro: Lounge Lo]
Lou, Lou, Lou, Lou, Lou...
Real niggaz lick shots, peace Connecticut
Aiyo Theodore, I see y'all, uh-huh
This Beez Mode with a eas' flow
Staten's Most Pop, man...
Aiyo, Pep, I see you, came with the back bone
And we back home, let's holla at them my dude

[Chorus 2X: Pep]
You're fucking with blockstars, toast cuffers 'n hot cars
Come out ya mouth wrong, I'ma blow your top off
EH! I'ma blow your top off
EH! Yeah, yo, get low or get knocked off

[Lounge Lo]
Aiyo, it's B and I'm back in the town
I heard the chit-chats, the kick back, I couldn't come back to the grounds
Boy, is you crazy? But picture that, you pay me pounds
Got a nigga right from Broad that's backing me down
The Ooh Building, 218, what's happening now?
I'm in the Regal with the Diesel looking to clap up clowns
Stone Gang, that's what I ride for, I'm burning a booger
While T.M.F. is in the Bridge, taking turns on a sugar
And mothafuckas wanna try my street cred
It's Simpson pimping, I don't limp, that's the heat in my leg
Staten's Most so the beef ain't dead
The beef started, Trife and B. Darted, I leave ya sea parted
The blockstars who knock hard then cop cars
Hit dice games and throw shots at ya block, pa
It's Drop City dropping, and we could get it popping
Knock ya top off then drive off in a shitty stocking

[Chorus 2X]

[Trife Diesel]
Aiyo, aiyo, I walk with a bop and talk with street slang
Keep the hammer on my waist and ain't scared to let it bang
Staten Island's Most Popular Son and Trife Diesel
Blow ya top off and then slide off in a white Regal
I'm a modern day pimp for that paper, suede blazers
Walk in the club past detectors with eight razors
Two in my mouth, two in my wallet, two in my pocket
And the other two is taped to my shoes, avoiding ya optics
Dressed in gothic, black Durango, presto chango
Roll down the window slightly, half way, and let them things go
Pop, every minute on the clock is counted for
Gotta check my connect cuz he owe me an ounce of raw
Uh, call me the trampeler, I move the rock like D. Wade
Boost Mobile gangstas, y'all niggaz is pre-paid
I'm a heat wave, sort've like them beach days
Bury Uncle Sam in the sand and watch my cheese raise

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
