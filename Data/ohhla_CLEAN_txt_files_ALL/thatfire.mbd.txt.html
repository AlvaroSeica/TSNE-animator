Chorus
Girl you got that fire
Play with my desire (play with my desire)
Girl you got that fire
Let me take you higher

Got me feeling, fiending
Everynight I'm dreaming, dreaming
Your love is so good, so good
If I could pay you for it cause

Chorus

Got me going crazy, crazy
I'll make you my lady, my lady
Girl you know you make me, you make me
Wanna let you have my baby, my baby
I don't wanna shake you with no one
I'm havesting you up, up
And if you feel the same
That could be your range
Make this more than just a one night stand

Chorus</pre>
