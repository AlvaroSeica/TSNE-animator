[Verse 1: Bow Wow]
Brown skin thing shawty thick like monique
I'll break her ass off look good in a two piece
Say to hell what ya'll think long black hair
One thing bout a big girl you could put it anywhere
Shawty is a ten she eye candy
Winter times when my big girl come in handy
Dress to impress and she so fly
All my ladys say (owh) looking good tonight
Got her own car pay her own bills
Fresh manicure and she dress to kill
That's what I like sexes me right
Call me energizer bow we can go all night
I know what I like I know what I want a fine big girl

[Verse 2: Yung Joc]
I don't want an itty bitty check nope sayonara
Give me a thick chick like the girl takara
When she orders it's an iontrey just for starters
Let her ride shotgun in the black impala
And she got a real stink walk with a nice set of jeans
That ain't a lil girl that's a well built machine
Since we talking bout it should might as well come clean
I wanna chick with a nice set of hips on my team
Got kushing for the pushing yea I like it
That booty so gushy yea I'll bite it
Patit chicks think they pretty but it's that I like it
She jumps on the boy and motorbike it
Tit-o-bitties in my face I call them mongo's

Baby they gotta be big because the boy hongo
I want all the big girls on the dance floor pronto...
