[Intro] [Bishop talking]
Hello! Fellow Americans. Haha
We've all been brought up to believe a lie that no matter
what race, color, creed. No matter how hard we work
we too can achieve the American dream. Are you livin' it?
 
[Verse One]
Yeah them cuss words moved us to the suburbs
Bought food when there was nothing in the cupboards
Fix my credit, lower class to the uppers
Million dollar homes still the neighbors call you, "niggers"
America, how sweet the sound
500 years later, still don't wanna ask around
New car?
Shit you prolly stole it
5 star restaurant? You must valet, take my keys, hold it
Fancy hotel, you in the penthouse suite
Walkin' down the hall there guess who you meet?
Though cracker sounds better lets call him Prejudice Pete
"I need some more towels boy, I wanna order somethin' to eat."
Flyin' first class just as bad
Terminal feels like a concentration camp
It's life or death to check your bags
Finally get on the plane, some lady got the nerve to ask
"You must be a sports star, can my son have your autograph?"
 
[Chorus]
I'm not racist, I got lots of black friends
No, no, no, no, no, no
Racism been over since way back then
No, no, no, no, no, no
Now the Constitution says all men are created equal
No, no, no, no, no, no
Kanye West is wrong, George Bush loves black people
No, no, no, no, no, no  

[Verse Two]
See the world through the eyes of a black man
Don't think you know cause you grew up being a rap fan
48 bars on a dope track can't explain it
BET, UPN, WB can't portray it
A Roots Box Set can't contain it
It's so hard to picture events, you can't paint it
Imagine being born in a world where
Color separates class no matter if you a millionaire
Of course they love Oprah
Cause she a billionaire
Without the camera though
That fancy sto' wouldn't let her in there
Kobe Bryant, he fly through the fuckin' air
Clean cut, perfect role model, fans screamin' "yeah"
Slipped, whoops, white girl, same fans screamin' "electric chair"
No more endorsements, can't buy commercials, no fair
But Kramer said he'd hang us, put a fork in our ass
Don Imus watchin' nappy headed hoes and just laugh

[Chorus]
I'm not racist, I got lots of black friends
No, no, no, no, no, no
Racism been over since way back then
No, no, no, no, no, no
Now the Constitution says all men are created equal
No, no, no, no, no, no
Kanye West is wrong, George Bush loves black people
No, no, no, no, no, no  

[Verse Three]
Yeah
Raise a hand if this done happened to you before
Counter clerk follow you around the liquor store
Raise your hand if this done happened to you before
Police detained your friends, they don't tell you what the fuck for
Brah
You just fit the description
Sit you on the curb or back seat if they trippin'
Slam you hard on the car hood if they really out flippin'
Now pay attention
Don't be a smarty
They just want a reason they can shoot somebody
Shot a brother 50 times at his bachelor party
No wonder why we always sayin', "Fuck tha police"
And ridin' in the streets hollerin' out "No justice, no peace."
Trust the government? Bitch no way
They the same evil bastards from back in the day
Shot Malcolm, a bunch of you up at UCLA
Martin Luther gave his life they gave him a holiday
 
[Chorus]
I'm not racist, I got lots of black friends
No, no, no, no, no, no
Racism been over since way back then
No, no, no, no, no, no
Now the Constitution says all men are created equal
No, no, no, no, no, no
Kanye West is wrong, George Bush loves black people
No, no, no, no, no, no   

[Outro]
Man, it's so crazy. I remember times when we was walkin' down the stree
and people would cross the other side of the street. Like you would go get them
I remember one time I was in the store
and this lady clutched her purse and I'm out my mind like
"Bitch! I got more in my ashtray than you got in your fuckin' account" 
Isn't that some crazy shit? I remember, ah, when I was down in Miami
stayin' at the Lowe's and I was out by the pool and shit
People kept coming up to me sayin'
"What football team do you play for? Are you a basketball-" 
"Bitch I can't even dribble! 
How the fuck, cause I'm tall and I'm black I gotta be a basketball player? 
Why can't I be a doctor or a lawyer. Fuck it
Man, I'm long winded so I'm just gonna make it quick
I-I believe that is the american dream
and we all need to wake up and really start livin' life. Peace</pre>
