*(Guce &amp; Bart)*

Now peep da git down.
Ya know. 
Now peep da git down.
The get down. 
Now peep da git down.
Bitch. Now peep da git down.
Peep da git down.
Now peep da git down. Juss peep da git down.
Ya know, lavishly coordinated.
When I'm in your town, best not try to clown.
Uh.

Verse 1 *(Guce)*

It all started back in eighty-six
wanted to be the big fish, dreams of moving kicks
caught up in banging, 
busting the pistol now I'm doing my thizzle
off that fifth of Hennessy, nigga take a swiggle
it gets down and illegal
in a seventy-seven Cutlass with no L's
banging up and down 3rd pounding being about my mail
mixing the Krypt wit nay Keek Tha Sneek say "Fa Sheel"
we gone about Mob by the pound, bitch got freaky tales
to my folk-els
the game is a mutha fucka
and I know you niggas be wondering how young Guce keep from going under
highway Chevy's, staying ready
watchin my ass, fading task
have you red, shaking the feds
Mossburg pump full of lead 
for theses marks up in the Town you see
cuz when I roll through a certian set it's all eyes on me.

Verse 2 *(Keek Tha Sneek)*

Give me the dutche
handling my all black rusty
small, fat and husky
four-four strapped tuckly
I was on my lonely
my only homie was the weapon on me
five-seven, a hundred and fourty-nine eleven can't even control me
dashing through trash cans, and broken glasses
just that water
rolling hundreds heavy in that ass
for killing and last, think I'm hit
failing crack my shit
barely dropped my clip
trying to caulk my shit
I'm on the wrong side of town
now Peep Da Git Down
when I'm in your town, best not try to clown.

Chorus *(Guce &amp; Bart)* x2

Now peep da git down. Peep da git down.
Juss peep da git down.
When I'm in your town, best not try and clown.

Verse 3 *(Bart)*

I come devastated
never waited 
I got to get it
and ain't no hesitating
flat line and then we hit 'em
don't need 'em desinated
for shortness they wonder who did it
them niggas got grenaded
to the brain, to the head they split it
I was wit it, wit it
when I came in, the game in
I was cool before, didn't want the fame in
but come wit it, saw the tank and run wit it
done once you did it
in this lifestyle my gun wet it
nigga I rip shit
gifted in many ways
from sports to stealing shit
addicted to getting paid
from powder to ballers
then chop it up wit my razor blade
if cowards they wanna, drop it then I take they fade
five was on the corner
I was a gonner if not for Ray
blowing up like World Trade
pull my pin, I'm a grenade
I live like shade
it ain't no exits just profits made
from "O" to Frisco
we on the door mixing Krypt wit nay.

Verse 4 *(Eclipse)*

Our suiCydalwayz will tortue
make 'em scream just like they dreaming
awaken by nightmares, so come prepared this evening
I hear you breathing slowly
now breath slower, I know you know me
I'm the one that holds the brains and remains of all your dead homies
torture and curse you
but this verse it needs no rehearsal
eventually you niggas will remember me like the virtual
now required
come expand, criminal attire
comands, its what hands, we advance to getting higher
suffer from dying
compositions written to warn
you niggas we taking over, been soldiers since we was born
picture us in a chapel
our Church would look like a castle
we naked and blindfolded, opponents a nasty example
no this ain't the streets, this is hell if you ain't never seen it
only mocking a murder, we unite to fight these demons
money and power, in this world is all that matters
come between wit a scheme
our sick team will make spleens splatter
(now peep da git down)
I was blessed to have a long dick
game like an old pimp
youngsta is what those hoes picked
sick of that old shit
multiple staying true by the way we speak our ebonics
act the holy chronic, after a show they get erotic
saying it's all about the Benjamin's
life is a pool, if you drowning that means you broke
if you rich then continue to swim.
Peep da git down.

*(Chorus)* x4

Now Peep da git down!</pre>
