[Playa Fly]

You rather see me abolished then see Lil Flizy demolished
and do some damage and punish, and do away with your garbage
to many stairs and mugs, instead of smiles and hugs
like womack looking for love for us wherever it was
with darker faces of hate, who wait and prey that I banish
and if they could man they would, take Mr.Flizy and banish
or just eradicate IBN eternal breathing suspension 
nor be the blood in my heart in lines of chalk on position
then know so many would laugh and say thats good for his ass
but what would Minnie and Bill do?, if Fly lay for they pass
my circumstances and chances, I take affallies and fumbles
when Fly stay flat on my feet, I hear no giggles and mumbles
you sit more silent then lambs, I blind shine the land
but not as hard as I can, cause its to fatal to stand
and this beneficent gift from G.O.D Fly keep
without him givin me speech Ill blow my brains to my feet.
And Playa

Chorus:
Fly write sum bump to take the pain out
cause if he wasn't high he probably blow his brains out
he's hopeless, this shit was in us as a baby
Taylor B and Minnie May Mafia gone crazy
(Repeat 2x)

[Playa Fly]

The game was put off in me, for I was put in the game
and Fly was going through struggles, before I'm knowing my name
with me and muff in a bug, two towns above I was drugged
left Bill with no knowledge of this can't be motherly love
miskican heights where she fled, but later ran into feds
she move that boy and that girl, right where we rested our heads
and stay a wraith on the scene, I'm reachin two years in age
left by a pole in and pamper and sheded tears full of rage
I told her I wanna go, and that's what started to hurt her
she cried I'm going downtown and you can't go its to dirty
and now my that my muff abducted, I'm left alone and corrupt
but to my rescue he flew, with no if ands and buts
off in a 72 impala with Jackie poo, 
they came and got playa, playa just like not nothing was new
and to this day he been resting and SPV catching blessing 
and thank Allah for my father and for the son he requested
and Playa

[Chorus] (Repeat 2x)

[Gangsta Blac]

My minds premeditated, have mercy on the casualty, tonk tied stupid
conversation only stop the heat, hold up, buck, read what you wrote up duck
showin nuff fo showdown what, burbon enuff to buck up for (?)
bitch we known for all this shit, witout take of allybies
and we gone from all this shit, see bitch trainin didnt get us bye
its heartic and pain, bitch cause we through in tha brain
we gonna keep all our composure, enought to maintain thangs
swiftly shaken from conversation bout' me and Fly way of life
see Blac down wit Fly, Fly down wit Blac, with the otherside
this game for gamin on em, I'll act a flat monkey on em
they head stay turnin on em our names gonna bring it to em
if I could say my few words, I probably would speak it all
you think we deaf and retarded and baried from all yall
we sam on plenty beef, chopped up in my crinium
I swear Fly will damage him everytime I depend on him, nigga...

[Chorus]  (Repeat 2x)

[Playa Fly]

I have no bleaf in the jin nor have beef in the jin
not fallin starz of gazoe, or arson willin to live
a helpin hand on my case, a versity face to may
it aint no sweat off my back, to bring allah in tha place
I feel that wishes so envy, and what I need hell send me
and Fly deserve what I want, thats why Im flexin my pimpin
and for my wife and my kids, Fly build a castle so big
our money be like McDuck, and just for fun lilgig
with little taylor baby ride, and plan to do this for life
with so much love for this brother, thats its removing my pride
and all the time that he lost, cant bring it back cause its bought
we remember whats in us and all the battles we fought
whether there mental or physical, or social o spiritual
some back if you got it Blac, from this individual
and Fly gonna shut up, and let the gangsta cut up
Im from the M to the third, with taylor baby so buck...

[Chorus] (Repeat till end)</pre>
