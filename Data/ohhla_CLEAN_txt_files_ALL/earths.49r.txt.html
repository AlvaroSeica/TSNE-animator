Hook (2xs)

All yeah we heard that you're waiting
For the crew that keeps the rap game percolating
All up in your city trying to kick it for the nation
Keep the music in tuned with the earth's rotation

Jas Mace

Check how the black plates rotations
And revolves like the earth around the sun it's all in unison
Everything pushes for an equilibrium
That's why the 49ers swinging back like a pendulum
To put this shit in order, my patience is getting shorter
They crossed the line like Elian swimming for the boarder
What's out of balance eventually must fall
So we stand tall keeping our foundation strong
We live long mother fucker and evolve with time
But some of y'all stay the same and I can hear it in your rhymes
See, we combined two extremes then came up with a mean
It's so fresh and so clean like Outkast out the washing machine
Ain't nothing wrong with pursuing your dreams
Don't let them hold you down and turn us into machines
A non-conformist who be thinking with his own mind
24-7, 365

All yeah we heard that you're waiting

All up in your city trying to kick it for the nation
Keep the music in tuned with the earth's rotation

Marchitect

Man I keep it flyer than a hand bill
I got my comp like the planes on stand still
I take the jam to land where no man will
We're like the truth that the FBI can't kill
We're like the venom that we spit up on the cordless
Every girlie that I'm seeing is gorgeous
Because that's how it is when 49ers touch down
Bash them like Rathmen what you suckers want now
My mind bust rhymes now I'm kicking it and getting it
And that's straight up and down like Prime Meridian
As I rap around the world like the equator
Keep it humble, push my own buttons in the elevator
To the top of the globe but a globe is a sphere
That's topless like the girls right here
49ers got the questions at hand
Before we start to plug the mic up better get what you can yo
