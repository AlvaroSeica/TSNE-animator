[Verse 1]
She's asleep now I can tell by her breathing
The slow and steady rhythm that her pulse is beating
Mine's more frantic, I wonder of what she's dreaming 
I wake up in the morning as she's off and leaving
and I Peel the covers back she's my big deal
My doctor phil fulfilled yeah she's my Brazil 
I'm seeing why she chose healing
The way we get along is a symptom of the close feeling
and though my monitor gets more of me than she does
We've got love but love does not always lead us and well, that's the grind
I wanna look back on my life and say I've done my time and
underline these cloud number 9s
We've both got our own hassles, the view we look out over 
Isn't always panoramic so our feathers get ruffled
Let's stay on our toes we never played it slow
Lay low but we stay on the go, so hear me out

[Chorus: Mark Pearl] {X2}
You should know that, you're my best friend
('there's no other')
Love for me
I got you and you got me

[Verse 2]
You should see the way she greets me, with her day changing smile 
she heats me, arms out to reach me
Years down the track could it be that it's so easy? 
I'll keep believing as long as she still needs me
Steady as decade-old oaks I find I'm envious of old folks 
who stay together until they croke
Still flushed with rushes of love to the head
Even after the years worth of words said
I want to share a deckchair and there I'll run
My worn out hands through your beautiful grey hair
And we'll laugh about, what we worried of in our 20s 
and We didn't stop to consider if we were ready
and we rarely placed the penny in any priority
We could groundhog day it without any monotony
Our love never sought no headline, nor sort no deadline 
Here we are again, it's bedtime

[Chorus: Mark Pearl] {X4}
You should know that, you're my best friend
('there's no other')
Love for me
I got you and you got me</pre>
