[Prelude: The Phantik]
We just want to thoroughly saturate areas with the reality of God
I mean the transcendent God-the God that's far above and beyond
Not the little guy in a frame, but, you know, eternal Father on the throne
We want to stress the preeminence of Christ Jesus the God-Man
It's been said that "You can't be so heavenly minded that you're of no earthly good."
(Come on now!) Yeah, well I'd like to present to some and introduce to others
The Lord Jesus, the Christ - the epitome of being Heavenly Minded, and of earthly good!!
Ya know what I'm sayin?  Now you tell me who's da man?

[Chorus]
(Yeah, tell me) Who's da man?  You know who's da man!
Tell me who's da man?  Tell ya friends who's da man.
You know who's da man. Who's da man?
Tell me who's da man? Yeah, who's da man?

[The Phantik]
Check the verse!
There's been a reverse in the Universe
It's God verses human nature
Creator verses created
who made it, and who mated
Was Jesus God-incarnated, or man-imaginated?
God said He made the earth, just by speakin', of us sleepin'
even still He took the time to chill just over the weekend
Man's says, "Get the reason be a part of the upper class"
But God can still move to the microphone or the jawbone of an ass
Using the foolish things of the world to confound the things of the wiseman
Look as I run this race and go for the trophy like it was the Heisman!
Man says" "God is dead".  but even still man dies
Jesus Christ still lives so evidently man lies!
Tell me who's da man with the world in His hand?
Is there any? Can he tangle with the blood of the Lamb?
Tell me, can you speak to the sun and make it rise
And in the evenin' speak again and tell the sun, "Get out the sky?"  Nah!
Can you count the grains of sand on the beach or seashore
knowin' everything ever taught by your teacher?
NOPE! But still this world is yours, so you say pal
knowin' you can go and catch a bullet any day now.
But kill me Â­- you'll see that Jesus will still be
Lord of Lords, always was plus He always will be
Really!
Feel the repercussion of His mighty hand!
Jesus Christ wasn't man-made, He MADE man!

[Chorus]

[The Phantik]
Foolish man...
They wanna brand my God, "generic"
but then they label His Word "esoteric"
No one here can get with the shed blood that Crips can't even bang with
They nailed him to the Cross and there He hung but none can hang with
the Language Starter, Universe Holder in the palm of His hand
He's even got a method to the madness.
All planned-I stand corrected.
All because Christ has resurrected!
Check out the Phanatik breakin' it down like phonetics.
I'm out of this world without the use of telekinetics!
Giving credit where its due to the risen long livin', sin forgivin'
All hail the throne dweller who doeth all things well.
Tell the press: "This is what the Sovereign Lord says"
Outside of Christ your outside of the Fortress
His world was born before you said your first verse
Surly He gets glory or the curse just gets worse
This is His earth
I'm a witness to that fact
I'm with this plus I'm black
Thanks to Christ my spiritual fitness is intact
In fact, his tactics need no practice: the time to rehearse (recognize)
From birth to the hearse Christ is da man!

[Chorus]

[The Phantik]
Draw back the curtain, planet earth is hurting for some answers
They walking in darkness with no lights in they lanterns
I bring the words of life with a style deadly like venom
Representin' Heaven in some boots and baggy denim
I get in 'em 'cause I'm plugged into that outlet from on High
Born and die to live again, so when this world has gone by
I'm online like a mainframe you know his name is Jesus.
Self maintained nothin' to lose  and all to gain.
You'll believe us when you see Him
Everybody wants to be Him
God and man at the same time
thinking that they don't with they lame rhyme.
Who spoke and provoked light to appear?
Who can go from right here to there in a light-year?
Yeah! I thought so, don't let me have to dig all in your torso.
And come out with your heart just to prove that you're still mortal.
Man ain't God.  God is God for infinity.
Bless the trinity!
Catch me rollin' with the infantry
'cause He's into me.
I'll be changed instantly.
All praise to The Ancient of Days is how it's meant to be.
Guess Who bless you?  Put His breath in you?
Christ is the only right one on the menu
Them who say He's not ain't got a clear view
He'll still be King of everything when we're through!
So where do you stand when it comes to the Blood of the Lamb?
I am that I am.

[Chorus]

[The Phantik(Talkin)]
Know what I'm sayin?
We run around here trying to prove who's da man?
Who can pull the most females...who can hold the most weight...
clock the most dough...
God come down here,  (ha ha) and beat us at our own game!
You tell me who's da man!
The Lord God
Yeah, yeah, yeah, like this!
The world's the Lord's, the world's the Lord's!
All praise to the Most High God for all days!
To the most High God!
