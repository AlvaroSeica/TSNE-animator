[Travie McCoy]
Sometimes, it seems it's harder to live than to regret
But there's nowhere to run girl, but there's nowhere to run
I've found you only live once, so don't look back
Cause there's nowhere to run girl, cause there's nowhere to run

[Chorus]
Hey - we can escape, into the masses
Slip out of our shells, cause there's no one to impress
So - grab, onto my hand, nothing can stop us
Live like there's no tomorrow; like there's no tomorrow

[Travie McCoy]
Sometimes, it's harder to face myself than face the world
But there's nowhere to run girl, but there's nowhere to run
I've found - we are who we are, so love yourself
Cause there's nowhere to run girl, cause there's nowhere to run

[Chorus]

[Travie McCoy]
Lips are talking, eyes are watching, now until the end
Wouldn't it be nice to let 'em miss us?
Our eyes are locking, lips are sloppily luring us to sins
I'll take my chances now and beg forgiveness

[Chorus] - repeat "like there's no tomorrow" 4X</pre>
