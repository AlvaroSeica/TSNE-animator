[Intro: Petey Pablo] + (Young Buck)
Cuz? (What's up nigga?)
If a muh'fucker woulda told me years ago
that the game today would be so fucked up
(C'mon, holla at'cha boy)
That these muh'fuckin niggaz be runnin around here actin mo' bitchy-fied
(Bitch niggaz) Wearin mo' panty liners
(I see these niggaz man) Hehe
Lord this shit crazy then a motherfucker
But you know what, tonight we gon' handle that shit
We gon' bring that bitch around y'all
(Aiyyo speak on these niggaz Petey, c'mon!)

[Petey Pablo]
95 percent of these supposed-to-be thugs is hoes
With Victoria Secret panties crammed in they asshole
Throwin them crooked fingers, dick-ridin the West coast
Them some real soldiers, y'all sum-bitches bogus
I call it like I call it, think I'm wrong, step forward
And get your mind pushed in a science class bucket
She's so into tough talkin now that 50 got on
Quit fantisizin 'bout that man life, and live ya own
You ain't never be hard, yo' mammy titty fed you too long
Probably still suck it if she pulled it out and showed ya
Tonight we gettin closure, I'm pointin out folks
Pullin niggaz cards, exposin what ya hold
I'm sorry if it feels you don't know me no mo'
Just had some shit on my mind and my chest, I had to get off
You can't judge a motherfuckin book by its cover
But I can spot a bitch a mile away, pardon me brother

[Chorus: Petey Pablo]
Oh it's on, get at me, bitch I wan' slap the shit
What you want? Drag, c'mon, bring all the bitch out
Oh it's on, get at me, bitch I wan' slap the shit
What you want? Drag, c'mon, bring all the bitch out
Oh it's on, get at me, bitch I wan' slap the shit
What you want? Drag, c'mon, bring all the bitch out
Oh it's on, get at me, bitch I wan' slap the shit
What you want? Drag, get you some, motherfucker

[Young Buck]
Here I go... get 'em Buck!

These niggaz catchin feelings, they ain't men, they women
And he gay, cause he wit him and he tryin to defend him
So I say, we should expose these hoes
I think our fans should know, to go and shoot up ya shows
Oh it's on now (on now) y'all can come on down
I got a desert eagle with a silencer, I swear it make no sound
A fo'-five caliber with some bullets that's so round
50 took a look at it and told me to slow down
Petey you need me nigga just holla and I got ya
Throw on some Frank Sinatra, and order me some pasta
They fuckin with some mobsters, see we can get it done
And I bet you at his funeral, nobody gon' come
I ain't here to be beefin with no nigga to get a name
If you pussy and show yo' panties I'm pullin out my thang
Got a habit of smackin faggots with semi-automatics
You niggaz in trouble, Buck and Petey back at it
It's on nigga!

[Chorus]

[Petey Pablo]
Bend that bitch right there with all ya might!
If he say, anything in here tonight, you don't like!
Bend that bitch right there with all ya might!
If he say, anything in here tonight, you don't like!

If it jump off in the club it's a jump-off in the club
She can toe up, just get tore up like I give a good Buck
All the champagne I done bought bitch I done paid for this chair
That I'm fittin to take and break across this sum-bitch head
Book of Bonecrusher, very first verse he done read (ATTEN-CHUN!)
That's on everything I love to drop dead (bitch I ain't NEVER scared!)
Fuck around get a main artery cut in half
Blood gushin out the side of your neck, bleedin to death
Needin a paramedic to reconnect and piecin you back together
I done seen it happen too many times out here - hate it man
It's gettin crucial out here and you takin this shit for granted
Pussy punk, panty wearin mascara faggot (pull the bitch out!)
Blowpop suckin ass, juicy fruity crooked man
Molested as a child by the babysitter daddy (pull the bitch out!)
Backstabbin motherfuckin crabs in a barrel
I can't stand 'em, but I bet I can handle 'em

[Chorus] Â– repeat 2X</pre>
