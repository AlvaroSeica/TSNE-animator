[Chorus 2X]
Yeah, I'm tryna turn this into something, turn this into something
Yeah, I'm tryna turn this into something, turn this into something
And we ain't tripping on the sun because the stars out
Chrome wheels, candy paint, bring the broads out

[Big K.R.I.T.]
Yeah, I'm tryna turn this into something on the go
Holler at my partner for some drank that I could po'
Sipping, candy dripping while I'm tipping on them Vogues
Horizontal, sideways, trunk might explode
Headed to the spot where the strippers show me love
cause they got them fire wings, and I love to grub
Tryna get my mind off my bitch back at home
Searching for a freaky bopper down to turn me on

[Chorus 2X]

[Big K.R.I.T.]
Yeah, I'm tryna turn this into something for the night
Gotta play it safe, drop my bait while she bite
She sucking and she fucking well, that's just my type
It's something bout that pussy when it's gushy under lights
She claims she know my name and she seen me out in public
Finally got the nerve to speak to me cause she been crushing
Agreeing, and whatever that I tell her, she'll bust it
I showed her what I'm bout, and turned her out soon as I touched it

[Chorus 2X]

[Big K.R.I.T.]
Yeah, I'm tryna turn this into something cause she bout it
Pimping put her in submission, she could never doubt it
Stock legs, cornbread fed, she a stallion
Drank in my tank, turn me up to a thousand
Crank it to the max while she shake it from the back
Claiming that she down, I'ma hit her with this 'Lac
Told her, turn around, scrub the ground to the beat
Sat that ass on my lap and whispered this to me

[Chorus 2X: Big K.R.I.T. and female]

[Outro]
"Aye, what's good my lady?
 Let me get down one more shot of Henny"
"Come on now, you sure you need one more shot babe?"
"Nah, I'ma be straight, I'm good man, I'm drinking
 You know what I'm saying?"</pre>
