Good morning, Mr. Foreman- did you enjoy the performance?
I'm warning you when I say women are swarming like hornets
To fornicate, but wait, can I have a talk with your daughter?
I just bought her a halter-top in order to call the spot
The sorta kinda place you vacate when the water's hot
I'm all that and then some, young smart and handsome
The phantom of the opera, I'll drop ya like Manson
Run up behind you; use my hand to cover your mouth
Damn you struggle and shout and there's blood on the couch
The cover is out, rubbing and snuffing you out
Put you in the oven, I'm shoving stuff in your house!

Vandalism is the best- not cannibalism
Having aneurisms, envision all my mannerisms
I've been living inside of this prison for years, every day I shed a new tear
But I'm still here, what?

Protect your neck or you'll get left with mainstream
Cuz I am in effect, get checks, I love C.R.E.A.M.
Wu-Tang forever- Jimmy's getting better
Feeling pretty fed up, I'm under high pressure
Man, y'all don't know what I'm going through it's whatever

Looking at the sun sinking slowly below the horizon
Hello to fantasizing thoughts about enterprising
Advertising my music- be uncompromising
When you're killing it like pioneers killed the bison

I like writing; it's striking how I can give birth
To a universe that works in every verse
You can't describe it- see 'em coming alive and
To hear a song of mine is my little one thriving
No jiving- I'm talking art masterpieces
A thesis is living within ever single speech and
The goal is not to be famous, I maintain arrangements
Acting pretty heinous, blowing fire out the anus

Tell I love "L"  yell out "Flamboyant"
13 years, it's still here and I enjoy it
I'm the people's choice, come through, they rejoice
Make noise for the voice you all enjoy

Protect your neck or you'll get left with mainstream
Cuz I am in effect, get checks, I love C.R.E.A.M.
Wu-Tang forever- Jimmy's getting better
Feeling pretty fed up, I'm under high pressure
Yo, this high pressure is killing me!

About to go poetic- let me count the ways
Get you music called Medusa, get you stoned for days
Fixated on the gaze that turned you into a statue
Jimmy is the greatest, put it on you like a tattoo
Get trapped like rats do- men into mice
Inventing a new flow just like the Edison light

I need an ice breaker- so I can talk to women
Slip a drink in em- thinking the room is spinning
In a couple minutes she'll be wrapped inside my linen
This night is just beginning, I'm Sheen, I'm winning
Pretending there was no sinning the minute she awakens
There's bacon in the kitchen and blood smeared on my apron

The devil's inside of me so I'll put him inside of you
What's another dead body?  I'll find it and try to hide it too
Bite into something new, I need guidance to help me choose
Decide if I'm alive so you'll be dead inside when you lose

Protect your neck or you'll get left with mainstream
Cuz I am in effect, get checks, I love C.R.E.A.M.
Wu-Tang forever- Jimmy's getting better
Feeling pretty fed up, I'm under high pressure

Y'all didn't think the song ended, did you?
Y'all crazy!
Jimmy P.'s song coming at ya!
You gotta protect ya neck though!
Yo- we about to set it off, another verse, let's get 'em!

My ink is running out, I better make it important
Assortments of bars so call the reinforcements
I saw the four horsemen and shot the equines
Must've been their deadline, time for bedtime
Cut at the waistline, breaking down like enzymes
Forget four horses, me and the five canines
The hounds of hell, when they bark it sounds the bell
To let you know to run and tell and impale yourself
I mean penetrate, more like a love thing
Cuz when I demonstrate, I leave bloodstains!

You haven't confronted me yet, it's funny you're set
With erratic old habits that make you run and forget
Wondering about coming back after discovering
All my brothers from other mothers suffer from the smothering
They can't breathe, no air in the cage they put us in
What could've been?  More like yo, what should've been</pre>
