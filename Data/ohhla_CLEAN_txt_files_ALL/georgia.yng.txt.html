[Hook]
Shorty so drunk she comin' out her clothes
Dick so big got it caught in her throat
Do it hurt?  (Yeah)  Do it hurt?  (Hell yeah!)
One and two that's what you get
When you let a nigga lick that clit
Do you like it?  (Yeah)  Wanna a nigga to bite it?  (Hell yeah!)

From the ceiling (From the ceiling) to the flo' (To the flo')
Till that ho don't want no mo' (no mo')
That bitch betta have my dough (my dough)
Suck it, suck it, suck it, suck it, suck it, suck it, suck it, suck it
suck it, suck it, suck it, suck it, suck it, suck it, suck it, suck it
suck it, suck it, suck it, suck it, suck it, suck it, suck it, suck it

[Verse One]
Niggas, I'ma tell ya, you can't trust a bitch far as you can smell 'em
You betta lick that stamp and mail 'em back over there to that other fella
(I care less) Like I s'posed to
(Always gotta stay fresh) Like I told you
(Don't tolerate that stress) Like I told you
(I punch a bitch in the breast) In the chest?
(Nigga, yes!)

[Verse Two]
I caught up with this ho she sucked my dick behind the sto'
And I spit all in her throat, then a nigga had to go, I had to roll
Then I'm lookin' for another headhogger
Georgia Dome, put your mouth on the dick, give me Georiga Dome
I love pussy, pussy is good but it always bleeds
when the time of the month come bitch it's your weakness

[Hook]

[Verse Three]
Fuck nigga, that's enough said
See a bitch is only good for a duckhead cracker
U-S-D-Grade A pure jaw jacker
Low self-esteem nigga came out mack her
Bring her to the world like a low-down nigga
(She the bomb!) You gotta pass a ho 'round nigga
(Here she come!) And all boxers fall
Shorty gon' play with the balls

[Verse Four]
Bitch please, I'm hotter than four-hundred degrees
Only time you use yo' mouth is when you get on your knees
So don't speak you shouldn't be sayin' nothin' at all
'Cause it's hard to talk when a mouthful of dick and balls
So put it in your mouth and blow
Put it deep down in your throat
Nigga like me don't want to hear that shit
So do what the fuck you been told

[Hook]

[Break]
I smoke by myself
I drink by myself
I fuck these hos by my goddamn self
You smoke by yourself
You drink by yourself
You fuck these niggas by your goddamn self

[Verse Five]
I don't forget about them women that love to get ate out
You'll be eatin' Red Lobster she'll suck it out
That's a four-course meal for a nigga like me
I'ma starve 'cause I ain't gon' eat
Now I don't eat nothin' that get up and walk away
Somethin' I got look at face-to-face
I say, "ew!  That's nasty!  Nigga if you wanna eat it you can have it."

[Hook]

[Outro]
All them fellas and all them females that love gettin' head
We call it Georgia Dome in Atlanta where we from, you see what I'm talkin' bout?
(???) (Can I get some Georgia Dome?  Can I get some Georgia Dome?)</pre>
