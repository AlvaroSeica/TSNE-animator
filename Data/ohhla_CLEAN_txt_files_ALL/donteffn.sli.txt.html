Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Walking on home tonight
I want to serenade
Tryin' to rid myself of
What your goin' to say
Why don't you leave me alone now
Just get the fuck away
Dont wanna hear the bullshit
That your gonna say
Whoa whoa whoa whoa
Stop starin' at me
Just leave me alone
Stop starin' at me
Hey hey hey hey
Dont fuck'n look
And why cant you offer
All the things I had to lose
Everything I had to say
Was just against the rules
Why don't you look at me now
Just get the fuck away
Dont wanna hear the bullshit
That your gonna say
Whoa whoa whoa whoa
Stop starin' at me
Just leave me alone
Stop starin' at me
Hey hey hey hey
Dont fuck'n look
Defending counter action
Got pain and suffering
Theres just the fucking shit now
__ up inside of me
I cant do anything now
Never mind kill the fool
Im plannin' on doin' time
Time for killin' you
Whoa whoa whoa whoa
Stop starin' at me
Just leave me alone
Stop starin' at me
Hey hey hey hey
Dont fuck'n look</pre>
