[Lil' Rob {Jimmy Castro in background}]
It's Cinco De Mayo {*whistling*}
Everybody grab your tequila shots, dawg and drink with me
Salud
Everybody gettin' all drunk and shit (That's right, it's the 5th of May)
But it's okay
Cause it's 5th of May {We're gonna party down}
It's Cinco De Mayo, and that's what we do (It's the 5th of May)
Take a beer {We're gonna party down}
And let's get down

(Verse 1)
I juiced up my ride last night
So that I can just
Get up and go, it's Cinco De Mayo
And we're riding low
All the ladies look real pretty
In the city
Down to party tonight
There's a few of them that I like to know
Give me another round
Me and the homeboys put 'em down
That's just what we do
No matter where you be at
You lean in the back
And eventually act a fool
But that's alright because it's

Chorus: Lil' Rob (Jimmy Castro in background)
Cinco De Mayo
And everybody singin'
Cinco De Mayo
And everybody drinkin' (We're gonna party down)
Cinco De Mayo
And everybody screamin'
Cinco De Mayo (We're gonna party down)

(Verse 2)
I'm proud to be Mexican
Mexican American
They call me Chicano
Party on Cinco De Mayo, every ano
See, we can sit here and drink all day
And play that mariachi loco to
Play and play (Ole!)
We just buy
A round of tequila shots
Now I'm gonna count to three
When I say, "One, two, three"
Tilt the glass
Everybody, drink with me
You'll be alright because it's

Repeat Chorus

[Lil' Rob]
Orale, orale
Come on

[Jimmy Castro]
Cinco De Mayo
We're gonna party down
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Lil' Rob]
Ya!

(Verse 3)
We're lookin' hard on the boulevard
In a lowrider limosine
It was the funkiest thing on wheels
That I've ever seen
You know what I mean?
It was full (???)
Sexy mamacitas
Partying on the 5th of May
Tomorrow, I'll eat menudo
To help cure my crudo
Cause I'll be sick
On the 6th of May
But that's okay, it's simply

Repeat Chorus

(Lil' Rob in background)
[Lil' Rob]     Come on
             Yeah
             Danny Rondo on the conga
             That's right
             My primo
             Jimmy Castro
             Goin' loco with the vocals, orale
[Jimmy Castro] Cinco
[Lil' Rob]     Yeah
