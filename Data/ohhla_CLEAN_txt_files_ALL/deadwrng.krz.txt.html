Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I've been in the game for like 10 of the damnest
The plan is, to get paid, bread, money like I'm Ahkmed
Get on top of the pile and it'll change the game, but the game ain't payin the same
The money and the fame it'll short stop you, It'll even robot you
Can't even afford pop, the underground been good to us
The whole world needa shoulda, woulda, could know us
And with techs respect, his fan base let me cash the check
And Kali baby on deck, if you on next, I suggest you protect your investment
Get it right from the nearest exit, We graduated and glad we made it
And hopin we can elevate your mind, and next time you rewind
Listen to genius and play the whole song, say Kali Baby dead wrong

[Chorus]
Dead wrong, if I take [?]
If I killed him, would you still love me (Dead Wrong)
Dead wrong, if I took [?]
If you killed me, then would you tell me
I'm a hog both lanes, take the shoulder [x3]

From juggalos to juggalets, from my new news to my vets
To my niggas in the projects, While they make it rain on em
I gain from em, they tat a nigga name on em
Ya'll know krizz, heard him on a couple of features
You seen him in every city, a couple of beaches
I Hit a couple of beaches, when I was overseas, I think aborigines
Make our music to fly, If you could do it like I
You see your people divide, can easily have your pick of the litter
Throw you headline and we bigger, welcome to the mid-western kings
Checks and things, blow money on our pinky rings
And we pushin Mercedes, play hot potato with ladies
Greatest, Kallid Baby

[Chorus]
Dead wrong, if I take [?]
If I killed him, would you still love me (Dead Wrong)
Dead wrong, if I took [?]
If you killed me, then would you tell me
I'm a hog both lanes, take the shoulder [x3]</pre>
