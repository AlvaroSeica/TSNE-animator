Lost &amp; Sherm'ed out, triple gold Dan's on the Coupe
Lost &amp; Sherm'ed out, Tec-9 on my lap in a khaki suit
Lost &amp; Sherm'ed out, if life was a drug I'd pay the loot
Lost &amp; Sherm'ed out, and when the C's kicks off I'm the first to shoot

[MAC-11]
I seem Lost &amp; Sherm'ed out without a motherfucking doubt
But in the right state of the mind to take the motherfucking trash out
The trash in my enemy
See I don't give no ?? I don't care if you cants me
Cuz this rap is your warning
I creep when you're yawning
Or when you're fucking your bitch at 3 o'clock in the morning
Squeeze a Sherman and then I squeeze the trigger
Break out a handcuff
And take the life from a nigger
Climb up to the top of the roof
Sit on the edge and talk shit and jump
Cause my heart is pumping sherm juice
I thought they knew that I was hazardous
Watching me move like Steve Austin
And talk slower than a bastard
It's getting kinda hot
I'm coming outta all my clothes
It's kinda fuck all the hoes
And no matter how high I get
Don't try to play me cause you get played like the O'Jays when I'm fuckin' your bitch

Lost &amp; Sherm'ed out, bet to have that bitch so damned smooth
Lost &amp; Sherm'ed out, I treat hoes like cats and kick 'em on the roof
Lost &amp; Sherm'ed out, roll up the bud and dip it in the juice
Lost &amp; Sherm'ed out, and when you had it you'd swear you were bulletproof 
Lost &amp; Sherm'ed out

I baptize motherfuckers in gasoline
Let 'em fly the loop
And blow they wig like Don King
Then peel they motherfucking skin back
Bury they asses so
And have'em burning like a hoodrat
Nigger - next is his hyna
See it's the quiet to murderer
Shoot 'em up fuck a Tec-9
I tie your ass through a glass house
Let the ass down
And drag your ass to your baby moma house
Somebody's who be found chopped in pieces
Kill up - brothers and sisters, cousins, friends and nieces
Grandpops, moms, uncles they asses gotta go
So when I say: fuck it, put it the blunt gotta  advise to hit the floor
We ain't tripping on dime
Cause we already dead
Fool every soul that you see 
Take up out of they forehead
And make 'em one of us don't no lie, get spared
Niggas is braggin' to hit to the wack
But fool I don't care

Lost &amp; Sherm'ed out, triple gold Dan's on the Coupe
Lost &amp; Sherm'ed out, Tec-9 on my lap in a khaki suit
Lost &amp; Sherm'ed out, if life was a drug I'd pay the loot
Lost &amp; Sherm'ed out, and when the C's kicks off I'm the first to shoot
I was Lost &amp; Sherm'ed out

Now I'm in the county
Looking at the walls
Playing with my balls
Washing out my drawers
Thinking about this damn situation that I'm in
Never did a nigga think he'll make it to the pen
Hoes they left me
Got a nigga sad
Times got me stressin' on reminiscing about the hoes I had
But I ain't tripping cause I'm shorter than a coffee table
I gotta break up some change, let's ???? to find ???? able
Thinking anothers from the O.G's
Nigga straight ballers selling chicken, birds and ki's
Gangstas on lock down
With the hour of rat
And the cops treat a nigga with no kind of respect
No phone cars, I wish I can leave
They kicking me to the side like a hard piece of cheese
I'm kinda fucked up in my head
And freeway ??? out of my room with my last piece of bread

Lost &amp; Sherm'ed out, triple gold Dan's on the Coupe
Lost &amp; Sherm'ed out, Tec-9 on my lap in a khaki suit
Lost &amp; Sherm'ed out, if life was a drug I'd pay the loot
Lost &amp; Sherm'ed out, and when the C's kicks off I'm the first to shoot</pre>
