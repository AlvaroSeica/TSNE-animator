Song:   Dry Your eyes
Typed by: nelly_ei@hotmail.com

In one single moment, your whole life can turn around
Stand there for a minute, starin' straight into the ground
Looking to the left slightly, then looking back down
The world feels like it's caved in proper, so he frown
Please let me show you how we could only just be for us
I can change, and I can grow, or we could adjust
The wicked thing about us is we always have trust
We can even have an open relationship if you must
I look at her, she stars almost straight back at me
But her eyes glaze over like she's looking straight through me
Then her eyes must of closed for what seems an eternity
When they open up she's lookin' down at her feet

(Chorus)
Dry your eyes mate
I know it's hard to take, but her mind has been made up
There's plenty more fish in the sea
Dry your eyes mate
I know you want to make her see how much this pain hurts
But you've got to walk away now
It's over

So then I move my hand up from down by my side
Shaking, my life is crashing, before my eyes
I turn the part of my hand up to face the skies
Touch the bottom of her chin and let out a sigh
Cause I can't imagine my life without you and me
There's things I can't imagine doing
Things I can't imagine seeing
It weren't suppose to be
Easy, surely, please please
I beg you, please
She brings her hand up towards where my hands rested
She wraps her fingers round mine with the softness she's blessed with
She peels away my fingers looks at me and then jestures
Of pushing my hand away to my chest, from hers

(Chorus)

And I'm just standing there
I can't say a word
Cause everything's just gone
I've got nothing
Absolutely nothing

Tryin' to pull her close out of bare desperation
Put my arms around her, tryin' and change what she's sayin'
Pull my head level with hers, so she might engage you
Look into her eyes to make her listen again
I'm not gonna fucking just fuck and leave it all now
Cause you said it will have been forever and that was your vow
And you're gonna let our things simply crash and fall down?
You're well out of order now, this is well outta town
She pulls away my arms to tightly clap around her waist
Genently pushes me back as she looks at me straight
Turns around so shes now got her back to my face
Takes one step forward, looks back
And then walks away

(Chorus)

I know in the past I've found it hard to say
Telling you things but not telling straight
But the more I put on your hand and say
The more you...pull away

(Chorus)</pre>
