[Keyshia Cole]
You know, I've seen some things...
It's important to stay strong
Wassup DJ Khaled?
It's your girl K.C.!

[Chorus]
If not they, then who?
Can carry on the weight of this world?
If not they, then who?
Will make sure all the people know how it feels
To be legendary!

[Chris Brown]
Baby don't cry no more
Cause I'm here to show you the way
I know you got some fight in you
So don't make losing so easy

[Chorus 1: Keyshia Cole]
Everybody's gonna fight
And everybody's gonna fall
But the ones that get up
Are always the strongest
Oh I can't imagine if I
Never went through nothing
I wouldn't be a fighter
And I wouldn't last the longest

[Chorus 2]
If not they, then who?
Can carry on the weight of this world?
If not they, then who?
Will make sure all the people know how it feels
To be legendary!

[Chris Brown]
Legends are born and created
Nothing's free, so I take it
It takes the determination! (We goin' in)
The nation!

[Chorus 1] + [Chorus 2]

[Ne-Yo]
I promise I'm a do it better than
Anybody's ever seen.
That I will be everything that everybody told me
I would never be
Got my feet on the ground, the wind at my back
My head to the sky (Won't stop now!)
No, not ever
You can see in my eyes
I will be legendary

[Chorus 2]

[DJ Khaled]
I remember when they told me no!
I looked them right in their eyes and I told 'em yes!
Don't let nobody stop your dreams!
Keep winning!
Rise to the top!
Keep your head up!
Young world! The world is yours!
We the best! Y.M.C.M.B.</pre>
