[Chorus 2X: Truck]
We came to party, all night long
Truck'll make you bounce to this
Buy the bar, out blow, a fucking ounce to this

[Truck]
Miami, palm streets, beautiful beaches
Mami right there, yeah I love her features
Everywhere she walk, guys follow like leeches
Double d's looking good, in your tanktop with white tees
Make me wanna take her home, make her wifey
Fine, show off, go ahead, wine and dine
The type that hold you down, while you on your grind
Damn, look at her body, most beautifullest thing in this party
So I tell the bartender, let me have another cup of Bacardi
So I can do my thing, right now with shorty
Shake that ass girl, tonight only we living in your world
Control the dance floor, baby love it when you bend down, twist and twirl
Come back up slow, like go head, girl
Don't let the beat stop you, DJ play that song

[Chorus 2X]

[Truck]
Now I'm back in New York, struttin' hard as fuck
A bounce of Staten Island niggas, so you know what's up
I told my man driving the truck, to slow it up
I just saw the baddest bitch with the biggest butt
I jump out smooth, yeah, put my mack down
She gave me her number, so you know it's a wrap now
I told her holla back, yeah, give her a call
Cuz tonight it's going down, up in Webster Hall
Outfor from one four fifth, fraction the dip
Custom made, homey, you ain't gonna see these kicks
Speeding FDR, back to back whips
Straight throught the Verrazano, on our way to the strip
It was whoever home bash, the streets on smash
A hell of a night, man, we had a damn blast
Do it again, just in case you might miss
Get up and party, I make you bounce to this

[Chorus 2X]

[Truck]
Come hang with the God, chill with the God
Mami, I wanna know how you feel with the God
Rubbing that ass on mine, got my dick all hard
Plus tonight almost through, so what you wanna do
With some friends, baby girl, well bring them too
Yeah to the Truck yard, we gon' all slide through
My boys there too, with the weed and brew
Ruthless Bastardz, you can' meet my whole crew
That's it, the nut cracker, roll up the haze
Just ya nonstop party that go on for days
Straight gangsta, baby, I'm stuck in my way...

[Chorus 2X] </pre>
