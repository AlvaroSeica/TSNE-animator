[Frank Ocean]
Swag swag, times two
I don't cry cause I'm strong
I don't cry cause nothin lasts forever
I don't cry cause the kids are grown
I don't cry at alllll
I don't cry cause them days are gone
Ooooh child, ooh child
But when the sun sets just right
Ooh I might
Shed a tear
And when the good word hits home
I'll shed a tear, I'll shed two tears
I won't cry in the car
I won't cry in the bathroom stall
I won't cry when I'm home alone
I won't cry at all
I won't cry cause them days are gone
Ooooh child, oooh baby doll
But if the sun shines too beautiful
I might - I'll shed two tears
And when the good word hits home I'll shed two more tears
Now that's fo' tears - you got enough?
No more tears, you've had enough
That's fo' tears</pre>
