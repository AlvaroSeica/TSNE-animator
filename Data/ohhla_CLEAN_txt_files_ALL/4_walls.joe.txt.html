[Intro over Chorus]
See, me? I'm talkin' bout somethin called...somethin' I like to call "it"
Ain't really got a name fro it
Only certain niggas suffer from this shit
Talkin' bout niggas that got like, niggas that got like a 6th sense
Sometimes you see shit that ain't there
Sometimes you hear shit ain't no body said nothin'
Sometimes you think you somewhere and you really somewhere totally different
It's almost like you hallucinating
But you sober, you ain't high. No drugs and nothin' like that
Sometimes you can BE high. Talkin' bout like, some paranoia or some shit

[Chorus]
Four walls, they surround me. Loneliness has found me
I'm waiting for you to return. Open the door, walk right on in
Darling let's start all over again

[Joe Budden]
Look. I don't give a fuck again
Thoughts in my head, lookin' like a nigga stuck with them
Wishing it abruptly ends. But God woke him up again
Everything is seeming so unfair. So unclear
Tryin' to reach out no one's there
Four walls tell em go run where no one cares
Screamin' this too shall pass
ridin' on fumes without gas, bills pilin' up without cash
Tryna maintain and outlast
Pray for me, keep tellin' niggas patiently wait for me
Keep tellin haters wait and see, I'm really tryna fill a vacancy
Been a long time it's taking me. Muhhfuckas keep mistakin' me
Mistakenly, cagin' me. Niggas never had no faith in me
Just a few pennies from dead
I got no identity left, victim of idenity theft
Problems never knew, it's revenue. Keep blamin' em it's never you
Keep tellin' baby girl I'm gonna leave and never do
Cause even when a nigga needs space, When you lookin' for a little leeway
Somebody puts it on replay, it's like it gets louder with each day
Pray

[Chourus]
Four walls, they surround me. Loneliness has found me
I'm waiting for you to return. Open the door, walk right on in
Darling let's start all over again

[Joe Budden]
Look, look. I'm tryna keep it formal now. But the pressure's on him now
I'll go ahead and warn you now, I'm tryna come across as normal now
All my life, I've been called insane. Looked at as if I'm strange
Can't tame em. Can't blame em for lookin' at me as if I can't change
With that said still I'm a rise. Though I keep it still in lies
Go ahead reveal your disguise, maybe that'll kill the surprise
Sometimes I feel deprived. Startin' when the guilt arrives
I noticed that the hills have eyes. When you on a heels of demise
And your man's on a ledge. Niggas tamperin' with my head
Hangin' head in the Phantom. Phantom's in my head
Can't escape, figured I'd be a candidate
I ain't gotta upper-hand to date. Can't be fate
Must think that I can handle weight. See, I'm thinkin of mansions, lakes
I was thinkin' Mandalay. Thinkin' I'd expand my stay
That's just the chance I'll take
Bow to my knees so the crowd appease, put em in the mouth of the beast
Crazy they didn't make him out to be
I'm just tryin' to make it out at least. Please

[Refrain]

[Outro over Chorus]
See what I'm talkin bout, they ain't really got terms for shit I'm talkin 'bout
I know they just diagnosed me with this shit. Like a, like a early age or shit
I don't mean four walls literally, nothin' like that
Four walls, I'm talkin' bout..
Ain't no windows. Ain't no sunlight. Ain't even a door
No locks, no nothing. Ain't gettin' outta that shit
You just try and get stuck
I'm talkin' bout four walls in ya head baby

I know a nigga like me
I been talkin' about a niggle like me for a long time
Fucked up out here
Can't even escape
We gon get em (haha)</pre>
