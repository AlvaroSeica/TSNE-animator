[Tre-8]
If I was to see you at the red light walkin', 
strugglin', stuck the fuck out,
I'd blow the horn, turn the radio up and peel the fuck out,
Leave you stranded, you don't understand it, I don't fuck with you,
Ain't nothin' you could do to make me fuck with you,
You two-faceded like a siamese twin,
You fuck with me, then you fuck with them,
Stirrin' up shit between us and them,
What's a friend for?  I been in more shit with you than an enemy,
You steady befriendin' me, then turn around sayin' you kin to me,
Simply I wanna knock your head off,
I dap ya off when you come around 
smilin' in my face just to play it off,
Don't wanna waste it all, my time in your life so shype,
I stay my distance, so you won't have to come up missin',
Listen, you pissin' me off faw, with that shit you be pullin',
You best to run with your life, before you get that bitch tooken,
I'm lookin' at'cha hard cuz you're givin' me bad vibes and funny feelings
I wanna grab ya by your neck and SQUEEZE til' you stop livin',
I don't fuck with you

[Tre-8]
See you the kinda nigga that come around when the good times rollin',
And be the first nigga to leave when the weed stop blowin',
Showin' your true identity, obviously you wanna be down,
But when a nigga pockets down that's when you're hard to be found,
Wanna clown, giggle, and cheese, bitch stop showin' your teeth,
Wanna get ass off of me, tellin' hoes you know me,
So we can go chill together?  Never, don't you ever,
Ever, ever, ever, tell hoes you know me,
I put that on my gold teeth, fool we don't get down like that,
You sayin' you was just bullshittin', but we don't clown like that,
Respect it, I ain't gone sweat it, I expect it from you,
That ain't the only hoe shit niggas like you try and do,
Ya see through when niggas see you we put out the blunts,
Try to tune your ass out cuz we know you bout to stunt,
Wanna come around here, with all that fake ass shit,
Prolly talkin' about somebody you was just with,
Playa hatin' ass bitch,
I don't fuck with you

[Tre-8]
Somebody just told me you was around here, talkin' my business,
Sayin' what I was about to do, playa hatin' like bitches,
And it's a shame, you think it's a game but I ain't playin' wit'cha nigga,
You make me wanna frame a T-shirt wit'cha God damned picture,
Get'cha fucked up, you lucked up, your Mama's so nice,
Cuz I'd put it in your life, and you know that, right?
You the type, to throw the brick and hide your hand,
Go to jail and find a man,
It's your type I just don't understand,
You'z a woman man,
Female ways in a man body,
I don't like ya brah, and you probably feel the same about me,
But doubt me, and get'cha fuckin' issue straight split,
I see the hoe in you, cuz you been a bitch,
It's fixin' to get dirty, ya heard me?  You better go ask Percy,
He told me from day one not to fuck with you turkeys,
Most certainly he was right, but I didn't know you was the type,
You act like a bitch who need dick in her life,
And I don't fuck with you</pre>
