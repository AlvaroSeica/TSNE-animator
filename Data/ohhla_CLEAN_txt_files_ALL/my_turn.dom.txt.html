[Intro: Dom Pachino]
Load 'em up, Team Napalm
Soldiers ready? The pressure's on
I'm coming in this time, man
Wiping 'em all out, no civilians will last
Gon' feel the Napalm, they all gon' feel it

[Dom Pachino]
Yo, picture being locked down in shackels, chains on my wrist &amp; ankles
No albums, no covers, no thank yous
No career, I can't have that, I've been through that, I'm here
They wanna see me fall apart, but I'm so together
They want me caught up in that storm, but I endore that weather
Now let's see, how they can endore the Terror
As I explore the era, my shit be too raw to measure
I got the c-4 that make 'em detour forever
And if they need more, I'mma make 'em bleed more better
Through their cap, through their jeans, sweater or their leather
It don't matter if it don't make sense, I mean
If it don't make dollars, if it not about chips, don't holla

[Chorus: Dom Pachino]
It's my turn, I seen a lot of niggas get rich
And I seen a lot of niggas turn snitch, but
It's my turn, I'm gon' run this show
Let me show 'em how this kid do

"Napalm" - Nas sample

[Dom Pachino]
You wanna act different, the mack spitting, attracting attention
Did someone mention, you were fucking with henchmen
And this is your sentence, your paragraph's demented
It needs special attention, I do some shit that have me fenced in
For life, Dom P. on the mic, and nice
Have a new breed of killas, blowing a strike
My strips five star, and my special ops is bizarre
By far fully armored car, pa, I'm ready for war
Load up the can goods, I'm going on tour
Keep condoms in the cupboard, my troops never go raw
For all my fallen soldiers, I pour, bottles of Lager
My shit on point, like the House of the Flying Daggers
I rep hard body, and walk off with my swagger
I beam you up, Scotty, blow off your wig, it won't matter
What's the consequence? Lose oxygen
My shit toxic, man, you lil' snitch gon' call the cops again

[Chorus]

"I embrace ya'll with Napalm" - Nas sample
	"You could put your whole army, against my team and..." - Prodigy sample
"I embrace ya'll with Napalm" - Nas sample
	"I guarantee you it'll be your very last time breathing" - Prodigy sample

[Dom Pachino]
I'm here, tough luck, niggas get stuck and fucked over
I thought I told ya'll, never to fuck around with the soldier
If you're weak, you'll fold, from the pressure
I'll embarass you, pull out the mack under the dresser
Eat your food like a lunch special, I invest in the music
Cuz it's monumental, stored in the God's temple
Can it be all so simple, that I get played all day and I pop like a pimple
But now I gotta grind harder, hit the streets with a squad, about a hundred
Rockin' show, giving promos, til they want it
And they a homo if they fronted
On Dom P., the streets most wanted

[Chorus]
