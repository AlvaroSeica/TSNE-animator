Song:   Let's Get Closer
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
Closer than close
Closer than most
I just see so much in you
&amp; I want a better view
I want to look deeper into you
Yeah

Let's get closer
well, well
closer than close

Lets get closer
closer than most
well

Yeah. Damn
where did we go wrong [?]
here I go again
with another love song
you say that I'm changing
sick all the complaining
tired 'f all the bullshit
-don't wanna entertain it
&amp;even though I'm single
I think 'bout you all the time
girl I ain't lying
hard to keep you off my mind
Yeah
we go back arguing
she found out my player ways
and all the girls I had
-don't wanna break your heart again
Sheea
why it can't be like the old days?
maybe 'kos me and you stuck in our old ways
first time I laid eyes on you
I was love struck
remember when I used to get it wet like swim trucks?

[Chorus]

Sheea
We used to be so close
but now things different
now your so distan
found messages on my twitter from some bitches
that got my girl trippin'
Shit
I coulda wifed Cee (Ciara)
it coulda been Ange (Angela Simmons)
but I guess GOD just didn't have 'em in the plan
but when you realize
I ain't like these other guys
put your Prada 'side girl
I know you want me in your life
You had talks with my momma
shared conversations
-hard to be faithful
when the streets keep me chasing-
I guess I'm caught up
my heart closed up
got me stressing over here
It's time for me to roll up

[Chorus]

[Bow Wow talking]
It's like, how can you hate somebody soo much
but then you love them at the same time [?]

Uhh
Now here we are
there's a lot at stake
look at our situation
some say that It's a mistake
but I ain't think so
b'kos I told you
&amp; fuck these jealous hoes
you know how girls do [x2]</pre>
