INTRO:
Yeah, yeah...
Yeah, yeah...

VERSE ONE:
If you really don't stop with your ways
That scathe the soul (yeah, yeah)
Then my feelings gon' drop, I'm amazed
I've stayed controlled (yeah, yeah)
You're pushing all my buttons it's alarming
No cushion for the fussin' that's common
I'm trying to extinguish this fire
But I need to come up for fresh air (air)
Things have gotten psychotic, crazy rotten and toxic
How'd we go from clearly clairvoyant to nearly neurotic?
Every topic a conflict, the opposite of melodic
Misunderstood like those who are good and also Islamic
Rare like a seeing a comet that when together we've bonded
This error has made our era erratic, not erotic
It's as if our problems are a sabotage you've plotted
Every time you bring 'em up like vomit 

CHORUS:
You gotta own it, you gotta want it
You gotta fight like you're playing for keeps
You gotta earn it, you gonna burn it
Spending your nights steady on the creep
You gotta own it, you gotta want it
You gotta fight like you're playing for keeps
You gotta prove it, you gonna lose it
So you better take it back if you wanna get it back from me

VERSE TWO:
If you really don't let all the heat
And the drama go (yeah, yeah)
Then I mean it, I'll jet, I won't help
Keep this climate cold (yeah, yeah)
Can you kills your crazy ways for a moment?
Or is every rainy day just an omen?
I'm trying to survive this drowning
But I need to come up for fresh air (air)
Stress in my system heightened, ball up my fists &amp; hide 'em
We both so tired and sick of being so sick and tired
Is it 'cause you missing diamonds that's got all your fits inspired?
You ain't no rapper, but every word that you spit is fire
Venomous verbal tyrant, a â180â, you've defined it
It seems you've turned this relationship into grits, you've fried it
Driven past crazy, hell's the destiny decided
We tried, but together we stand divided

CHORUS:
You gotta own it, you gotta want it
You gotta fight like you're playing for keeps
You gotta earn it, you gonna burn it
Spending your nights steady on the creep
You gotta own it, you gotta want it
You gotta fight like you're playing for keeps
You gotta prove it, you gonna lose it
So you better take it back if you wanna get it back from me

OUTRO:
Yeah, yeah...
Yeah, yeah...
Yeah, yeah...
Yeah, yeah...</pre>
