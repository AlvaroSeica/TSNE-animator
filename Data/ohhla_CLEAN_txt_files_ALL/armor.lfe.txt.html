[StreetLife]
Yeah, what?
Feel the fire
Word life
Yo, yo, yo...

What's your major malfunction
for pumpin that watered down substance?
Kid, watch for the snuffings
Wu-Tang Productions paralyze the function
Street corruptions, no interruptions
Son of my father's mother's ex-husband
Uncle's sister's son, his daughter's cousin
Raised in a Killin Fields with a gun, stay bustin
I keep supplyin this Uncontrolled Substance
Highly-explosive radio-active doses
Spontaneous flow that's very impulsive
Raw material that's anti-corrosive
My additude stay intensly repulsive
Wanna be MC's? First you gotta face me
S-T-R double E-T, mostly low key
'til someone provokes me, stay anti-socially
So don't bother approachin me
Keep the burner closely and mosey
Catch me where the hoes be, Shaolin O.G.
With my voice box rid of toxic
Killah Hill Projects, we lock shit
Fuck the opposite, eat a dick
I talk mad shit cuz I could back it
Plus eight-fice percent of y'all rappers is actors
You'se a sex symbol, shakin ya ass to sell a single
But you sold out, yo, you sold out
You walked the whole route, and now you straight trout
and now you straight trout, get snuffed the fuck out!!!

[StreetLife]
Yo, Supreme intelligence, Killah Hill resident
Wu-Element, yo, my logo's done with excellence
Street specialist, holdin this, solo lyricist
Black supremesist from the nine delious
Ghetto chemisist, the tip of my tongue is venomous
Spit Poisonous Darts continuous
All you fatter cats with battery backs
And gangster raps, claimin how much gats you pack
You still wack, you'se a suspect
No respect, catch a chit chat
Talkin nines and techs, you haven't met Street yet
Quick to shit on ya rep, cosmetic fuck
This is B-B conduct, Shaolin What!? What!?

[StreetLife]
This is Street Life delivery, heavy artillerary
("We could bust a shot...")
Thug therapy until they bury me, fellin me?
Shattered armor, my code of honor
Never diss honor, stay far beyond of this
You wearin toga suits and open-toed sandles
Eatin Strange Fruit, gettin man-handled
Control your lust, never reach and don't bust
Watch who you trust, get Digi like dust
Street Life, you know the type, bloody ya eye sight
I'm takin all fights tonight, on mic or off mic
You ain't controlled, you seein, yo, got your suit
Don't put your faith in the flute, son, you're mad loose
Another thug turned bitch, the industry made you switch
Done shattered your armor and now you ain't shit
Look at your now with your washed up style
Represent it 'til I die, N.Y., Shaolin Isle
