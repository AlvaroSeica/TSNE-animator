[Intro - J. Cole] - w/ ad libs
Got me up all night, all I'm singin is love songs
She got me up all night, constant drinkin and love songs
She got me up all night, down and out with these love songs
She got me up all night, drownin out with these love songs
She got me up all night (yeah), all I'm singin is love songs
She got me up all night (yeah), constant drinkin and love songs
She got me up all night (yeah), down and out with these love songs
She got me open all night (uh huh), got me open all night (hey)

[Verse 1 - J. Cole]
Okay, back when I was sleepin in my mama crib
Or even back when I was up there in Muhammad crib
Payin seventeen-hundred for the rent, money well spent
No heater, but a nigga made heat, may I vent
Had a thing for you, even wrote the song +Dreams+ for you
'Cause I had dreams for you, thoughts of a ring for you
Childish shit, you know childish shit
Anonymous flowers sent, you know coward shit
Now a nigga signed to Hov, took a power trip
Back home I'm grown now and this city's my throne now (ha)
The same clubs that I used to get tossed out
Life got crisscrossed, totally crossed out
'Cause now I'm in this bitch and I'm totally bossed out
Old chicks cryin 'cause they know that they lost out
But, I'm still on you, I'm still on you
My drink spill on me, while I feel on you (I'm sayin)

[Break - Miguel]
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want you, to want me
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want ya

[Chorus - J. Cole] - w/ ad libs
And we are, we are, we are
Got me up all night
And we are, we are, we are
All I'm singin is love songs
And we are, we are, we are
Got me up all night
And we are, we are, we are (she got me)
We are, we are, we are (she got me)

[Verse 2 - J. Cole]
Well this is gotta be the longest crush ever
If I ever get to fuck, it'd be the longest bust ever
Love is a drug, like the strongest stuff ever
And, fuck it I'm on one, you feel me?
She on a power trip, she got me where she want a nigga
Wifin in the club, man my homies' gon' disown a nigga
Like, give me twenty dollar, dollar
Ass stupid, how you get to college, college
I'm in your city and I'm wonderin if you're home now
Went and found a man, but I'm hopin you alone now
Can't help but feelin like I dropped the ball, cliche
I used to pop up on you at the mall each day
Now typically I kick game like Eastbay
But you got a nigga freeze-framed yellin - "please play!"
For Pete's sake, homie pull it together
Just fuck her one time and be through it forever (but)

[Break - Miguel]
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want you, to want me
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want ya, yeah!

[Chorus - J. Cole] - w/ ad libs
And we are, we are, we are
Got me up all night
And we are, we are, we are
All I'm singin is love songs
And we are, we are, we are
Got me up all night
And we are, we are, we are (she got me)
We are, we are, we are (she got me)

[Outro - J. Cole] - w/ ad libs
Got me up all night (all night), all I'm singin is love songs
She got me up all night (all night), constant drinkin and love songs
She got me up all night (all night), down and out with these love songs
She got me up all night (all night), drownin out with these love songs
She got me up all night (yeah), all I'm singin is love songs
She got me up all night (yeah), constant drinkin and love songs
She got me up all night (yeah), down and out with these love songs
She got me open all night (uh huh), got me open all night (hey)</pre>
