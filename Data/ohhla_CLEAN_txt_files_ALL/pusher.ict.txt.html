[Intro: Afrika Islam]
Yo, what's up man? - I need to get high, man
I need to get hold of some big time dope, man
You know where I can get a key?

[Ice-T]
I know where you can get an LP

[Afrika Islam]
LP man? - have you went crazy man?
I'm talking about some dope, man
I need to get high right now, man
Why don't you hook me up with a five-0?

[Ice-T]

I can hook you up with a 12 Inch

[Afrika Islam]
12 Inch, man? - You done went crazy?
You don't even know what time it is, out here on the streets
And don't know what time it is man, you was a fool!

[Ice-T]
Yo homeboy, YOU'RE a fool, you don't know what time it is 
Out here messing up your mind, you know what I'm saying?
This is Ice-T talking to you boy, I'ma tell you what TIME it is

[Verse One: Ice-T]
Yo, it's time for me to pump up the volume
No problem, the record's revolving
Evil's the mixer, I'm the rap Trickster
Paparazzi is on the bum rush for pictures
Ice, cooling, yo, colder than ever
Punk executioner, E pulled the lever
Rotate the wax then cut and axe the tracks
Push up the levels, til the red lights max
Don't try to size up, you better wise up
To the rap criminals, we're on the rise up
We're selling dope, til we're succeeded
Dope beats and lyrics, no beepers needed
For this drug deal, I'm the big wheel
The dope I'm selling, you don't smoke, you feel
Out on the dancefloor, on my world tour
I'm selling dope in each and every record store
I'm the kingpin when the wax spins
Crack or smack will take you to a sure end
You don't need it, just throw that stuff away
You wanna get high? - Let the record play

[Afrika Islam]
Oh! man, I like this dope hit man
It's feeling alright boy, what you say your name was man?

[Chorus: Curtis Mayfield]
I'm your momma, I'm your daddy, I'm that nigga in the alley
I'm the brother when you need, a true player to MC
You know me, I'm your friend, your main boy thick and thin
MC Ice-T, I'm your pusher

[Verse Two: Ice-T]
I know you're loving this drug as it's coming out your speakers
Bass through the buttons, highs through the tweeters
But this base, you don't need a pipe
Just a tempo to keep your hype
Grooving like I see you doing
Some stupid crack, would just ruin
Your natural high, why? - that ain't fly
And anyone who says it is, lies
Move like I knew you would, like I knew could
And if you ain't cracked out, then I know you should
Be able to give me a clap, to match exact with the track
And since I know that you ain't, I expect that
Oh! now this jam is lit, it's like the ultimate
People high off dope but still physically fit
I'll make a million bucks, pack my dough in trucks
From selling dope beats, dope rhymes, dope cuts
I'll be the biggest dope dealer in history
Because all the fly will be high off that Ice-T

[Afrika Islam]
Oh! man, you ain't never lied, man, this dope is alright, man
I got to get back with you, man, let me get your number, man

[Chorus: Curtis Mayfield]

[Verse Three: Ice-T]
I'll bring it to boil or Evil E rock it up
You want end? - I don't think you got enough
Last suckers crossed, Syndicate shot them up
Cops found them in the lake bottom up
I don't play when it comes to my dope
I check my lyrics close, like with a microscope
I don't clean them up with no ivory soap
I leave them hard and pure, hope that you can cope
Cause you might O.D. if you overdrive
This record, tape or CD, because the sound I've
Created on this wax is like a chemical
And the knowledge I give, makes me invincible

[Islam] Oh! Mr. Dope Man, I'm loving you, man
You got it going on, man - what else you got?
[Ice-T] I got some of that Kool Moe Dee

[Islam] Oh! yeah, man, I want some of that, man
[Ice-T] Got some Doug E. Fresh
[Islam] Oh! give me an ounce of that man, I want that all night long
[Ice-T] Got some Eric B. &amp; Rakim
[Islam] Oh! that is some real dope right there
[Ice-T] Got some of that LL Cool J
[Islam] No, no man, I don't want none of that man, you can keep that man
[Ice-T] Got some Boogie Down Productions, KRS-One
[Islam] Oh! now you're talking man, come on!
[Ice-T] Public Enemy..
[Islam] Yeah, don't stop, don't stop!
[Ice-T] Biz Markie..
[Islam] Make the music with your mouth Biz, I love it

[Chorus: Curtis Mayfield]

[Verse Four: Ice-T]
The cops just don't know what to do, because my dope breaks through
No matter what they do, my stuff gets to you
Kicking on the Boulevard, my tempo's hyped and hard
I don't ask, the Ice just Bogards
Sire Records puts me out, with Warner Brothers' clout
My dope hits the street with no doubt
Evil E adds the cut, then removes it
Is' checks for purity, and then approves it
And then you get it, try it, and like it
And if it ain't potent, we'll remix and spike it
To bring you the pure dope, not a noose in a rope
Cause if you're doing crack, you're on death row
You're just a toy punk, to mess with that junk
You want some real dope, come look in my trunk
The dope I'm selling is life, a hundred percent legit
So get real fool, and try some real hit

[Afrika Islam]
Word up! my brother, you got me high as a kite
I feel good tonight, Ice-T man, you're alright!

[Chorus: Curtis Mayfield]</pre>
