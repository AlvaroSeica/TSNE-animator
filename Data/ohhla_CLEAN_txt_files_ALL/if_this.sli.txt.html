Song:   If This World Were Mine
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Whoa
Yeah
But if this world were mine
They'd play rub-a-dub all the time
But then me playin' with this double bass line
They playin' with the wicked man style
Because me born as a discipline child
Whoa
Yeah
But if this world were mine
They'd play rub a dub all the time
But then me playin' with this double bass line
They playin' with the wicked man style
Because me born as a discipline..
But since me was a youth
Me taught to love your mother
Come again now
But since me was a youth
Me taught to love your father
Said
But if you listen carefully
Then you must be consider
But the reason that we play
The music's to feel much stronger
But son you've got to take it
At least three times a day
But if you wanna be quick
And livin' in the irie way
You've got to pick it up boy
Pick it up, pick it up
But i wanna pick it up boy
Pick it up pick it up pick it up
But i wanna pick it up boy
Before he want to come to getcha' ganja say

Whoa
Yeah
But if this world were mine
They playin'rub-a-dubbin' all the time
But then me playin' with this wicked bass line
Me playin with the wicked (rub-a-dub) dub style
Because me born as a discipline child</pre>
