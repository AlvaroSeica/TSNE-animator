[Chorus: G. Test and Danny!]
(We can do it like this)
We can do it like this
We can do it like this
We can do it like THAT, girl
(Like this?) We can do it like this
We can do it like this
We can do it like THAT, girl
(Like this?) We can do it like this
We can do it like this
We can do it like THAT, girl
(Like this?) We can do it like this
We can do it like
We can do it like, uh

[Verse 1: G. Test]
We can do it like, THIS
Peep game that I spit
So prolific, ?
Cheeks ?
? rude to a kiss
Parallel with a carousel
Feelin' high while I glide from the sip
Too much shots I got, ridin' ya hips
Don't look at the clock, we gon' rock 'til it quits
Don't stop 'til it hits...in the midst
Of a kiss you gon' flip, then we gon' ride to the crib
No ad-lib, non-verbal assist
No words heard but I murder the shit
Like, "damn, we can do it like that"
Too loud for the crowd, gotta ? like that
Matter of fact, the way I murder a track
Is similar to the game that I craft
I know you like that
Smooth grain how I spit game
So young dame, just remember the name:
G. Test

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Danny!]
Now that I'm rocky, I'm so damn cocky
Bitches on my jock, watch 'em flock to me
What up chick?  Before we do it like this
Can you move your nice lips on my tip?  Thanks Mo' (thanks Morgan)
I'm tryin' to find me a ghost-top
Most ghost-tops boast that they supposed to b-blow cock
Or dick, shit, whatever you call it
Now that I'm harder than a cylinder block
I'll find a girl with low self-esteem, feel on her rocks
It's funny what a shot of Smirnoff'll do to me
It's got me thinkin' I can move when I usually
Do a little hip swivel, my dick shrivel
If I lose my buzz, and forget about how cool I was
I'm tryin' to find an overnight romance
Told the shorty with the white pants, 'I don't dance,
But if you move your little hips
We can groove and we can do it like this'

[Chorus]</pre>
