Chorus:
I be doing my thang (doing my thang)
You know that I be doing my thang (doing my thang)
Can't stop B Gizzle
 
Verse 1:
You know my pimp game tight, mack game official
Streets still the same so I stay packing a pistol
Code never changed, Always keep your heater with you
Never know when a heater in the cut trying to get you
Cruise through the hood on dubs in the winter
Dub deuces in the summer, I'm hellafied nigga
26s on my hummer, get my shine on nigga
I can do it like that cause I get my grind on nigga
And I hustle however I gotta whenever I want
where ever I'm at, weed, dope, pills, or crack
I be getting connected, making the moves
And plugging my click so let a real G do what he do
Cause I'ma do it if you want me to do it or not
I think its best you let me if you don't wanna get shot
I think its best you respect me if you don't wanna get shot
If you test me, the results is I wet up your block
 
Chorus x2
 
Verse 2:
Get in touch with me if you ain't know where the yay at?
Keep 50 bricks laced in the trunk of the maybach
I don't give out my number cause niggas rat, I don't play that
Never give a fed something that have to cause the playback
Have me where all my niggas from back in the day at
On the conspiracy, asking myself why did I say that?
I know better, I can sniff a snitch out
Just as quick as I can bat a bitch and pull my dick out
Just as quick as I can open shop and move a brick out
I change route, I feel that vibe, I'm good at scoping shit out
Good at duct-taping those hoe niggas who open their mouth
Informers informing their people that the cope out the drought
Fuck with a nigga money, that ain't how it go in the south
That how the fuck you get caught up and ain't a way out
I think its best you respect me if you don't wanna get shot
If you test me, the results is I wet up your block
 
Chorus x2
 
Verse 3:
Money in the mission I'm on, No lying
I ain't fifty but I'ma get rich or die trying
If the work good and the price sweet, I'ma buy it
Gotta hope who'll hit the train drive back or fly
My city on lock when its wet and its dry
Gotta connect like the internet, I stays online
Gotta benz on chromes so wet, stay on shine
My nigga get on your game cause I stays on mine
Nigga who played games, I spray K's and Nine's
It's chopper city and we ready to ride or die
I think its best you respect me if you don't wanna get shot
You test me, the results is I wet up your block
 
Chorus x3</pre>
