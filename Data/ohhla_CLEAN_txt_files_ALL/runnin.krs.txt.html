[Intro: Buckshot]
Why you runnin away, way, way
They on they way way way way way
Stop runnin away, way, way
They on they way way way way way
Why you runnin away, way, way
They on they way way way way way
Stop runnin away, way, way
They on they way way way way way
Stand up~!

[Buckshot]
In my neighborhood there's a bullet
for every black man with a trigger if he pull it
But could he take another option instead of stoppin? Yup!
Next time keep it movin up the block on Duck
Down on the penal code, the C in fold
While smart motherfuckers take the scenic road
Better known as the other route
The way the cops is hoppin out on my niggaz is like a scene from "Slaughterhouse"
Word of mouth, does more damage than gunpowder
Niggaz feelings get hurt, now it's a problem
I got them, on the phone talkin the back bar
Lord sayin what's goin on in my back yard
The facts are, every black man ain't a rap star
or track star or trap star, I know we get that far
But wait

[Chorus 2X: Buckshot]
What you gon' do? Keep on runnin
D's keep comin, we see somethin
Out of the blue, when it comes to this
They don't miss one shot, one hit
What you gon' do?

[Immortal Technique]
I don't care if you bump this while you fuck in your whip
Or if you stuck to the script like plantain chips
Just remember soldier, that when the government flips
it's goin down harder than the last bullet in the Glock clip
Visions of the future toxic in my cranium
Like the byproducts of enriching uranium
Gentrification byproduct like the palladium
So this is the message, that I relate to them
'Fore they do me like Amadou, I'ma do what I gotta do
You should follow through before they bottle you out of the blue
They treat niggaz and spics like tigers and lions
Cute little babies but when they grow put 'em behind iron
Let 'em join the military, fight for the country hard
Throw 'em some college money, get 'em a green card
Get a black Pinocchio president to lead
But controlled by an all-white Geppetto on Wall Street
Guerilla war, through the jungles of concrete
Microphone, like the Kalakov in my arm's reach
Fuck the commercial world, I'd rather spit raw
We carry the underground, like a rickshaw
Hard work like raising children on food stamps
Trained to fuck you up, like a terrorist boot camp
I'm here to celebrate the rebirth of an age
Start the BDP, motherfuckers right off stage

[Chorus]

[KRS-One]
KRS, Buckshot, Brooklyn love dot
Brrap to the realness, we dustin them bloodclaat
Bronx man come true like POP POP!
.22, .45 Glock, we stock dat
Before I put your mop back I'm pushin a cop back
Cause they violent and I'm tryin to stop that
People act like it's insanity to fight back
Yeah I know Mr. Sean Hannity won't like that
Huh, but they ain't gon' like this either
They hate it when slaves become writers and readers
And hold heaters, and don't need they FEMAs
We culture keepers, hip-hop's true leaders
The teacher, I'm chillin in New Orleans
under the I-10 with the last victims of Katrina
You gotta see the corruption
Families dyin, and we still on the TV buggin?
Rise up niggaz, get your guns up niggaz
Feed your family, get your funds up niggaz
Rise up niggaz, get your guns up niggaz
Feed your family, get your son - LISTEN!
It's an honor to be rockin with Duck Down
As you can see it's a good thing you stuck 'round
Fuck clowns, we the original buck town
We generals with connections to uptown
We gotta tell the crowd calm down
Cause we rock in cities and farm towns
I'm armed now
You know true revolutionaries are beyond guns, we throwin bombs now
{*BOOM*} ...
Let me go freestyle while I got the chance
This is about talk, real talk not dance
Huh, I'm in the studio
Live brothers you know, this is how we go
And we got to go, home, home
Buck town, Duck Down {*4X*}</pre>
