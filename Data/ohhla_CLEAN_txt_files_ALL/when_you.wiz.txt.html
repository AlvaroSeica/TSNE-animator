[Intro]
Damn...
Don't
Don't
Damn...

Yeah, don't leave cause you're my oxygen without you I won't breathe
you're everything I want, need, for you I wear my heart on a short sleeve
I know some things need changing, that takes time I need more, please
say I ain't do everything I could of done
like the shit that I did ain't good enough
your friends said they been would have left
ain't do you right so you head to the left
I can't say that I blame you
or ever thought that it would be this painful
people do it everyday I could change too
but dealing with the heartbreaks what she can't do, true 
and that's as real get 
what you feel ain't easy to deal with

[CHORUS]
when you find the girl you love, has gone
you ask yourself why life, must go on
you beg your lord above, to send someone your way
but deep inside you pray, he'll bring her back someday

Yeah, don't go
how to live my life without you I just don't know
what you feel in this relationship 
it's not that it can't, it just won't grow 
I say I love you you say it don't show
fuck the money and them gifts don't count
what about the smaller things you needed 
and why the fuck you had to leave before I seen it
damn, I need your love like a weed stick
me without you like kathy no regis
I kept secrets and couldn't apologize enough times for messing with that freak bitch 
but I can still tell that you're leavin
and like I said I can't blame you the least bit
the crying shame is times changing
best friends become strangers that's how it is

[CHORUS]</pre>
