Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Hook]
I don't give a fuck about chu anymore (anymore)
I don't give a fuck about chu anymore, girl (anymore)

[Verse 1]
told you it was gon' cost you (told you)
I misplace things, I'm sorry if I lost you
yeah right, I fuck your best friend purposely
my hearts teflon how dare you try hurt'n me
I fuck shorty you hate, I told her work with me
and she do it better than you bitch
that's word to me
we send the vids to your facebook
I wish I would of seen how your face looked
while I'm violating, your a pretender
you caught amnesia, you don't remember?
well I got the memory of an elephant
I would say the nigga name, but he ain't relevant

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
your sister told me you was crying
and was feeling like you were dying
I told if I said 'I give a fuck'
I'd be lying
cupid sent a slug through my shirt
told me if you cross me, my love would reverse
stupid bitch, damn you
I'm glad your heart is cripple
I can't stand you
I was the man who planned to cuff it up
but you had dicks on the ceiling, you fucked it up
lying ass hoe
I bounce right up, now I'm flying that's low
told you I got the memory of an elephant
I would say the nigga name, but he ain't relevant

[Hook]

[Bridge]
I'ma I'ma I'ma real nigga
I deserve better
so fuck you
I'ma I'ma I'ma real nigga
I deserve better
so fuck you
I hate chu
I don't give a fuck about chu anymore (anymore)
I don't give a fuck about chu anymore girl (anymore)
Oh yeah</pre>
