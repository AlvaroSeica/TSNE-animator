[Intro: Buddha Monk]
Hahahahahahaha, here go them Zu dudes again, whoo!

[Chorus: Buddha Monk]
All I'm thinking is a chick like you (Would you be my lady?)
Keep a gangsta, shell top, 22 Maybach drop (Ride wit me, baby)
I got a sidekick, hoodie chick, wifey, full clip, bump (is you wit me, lady?)
Keep the Henny and Patron, up, glory up, now my niggas up (in the VIP, baby)

[12 O'Clock]
See, park the car, put the clip in him
And put it in your place, get in the club wit him
We buy five bottles and we poppin' 'em
We in the VIP, niggas keep watching them
It's all 'good times' like coppin' Timbs
JJ, Grandma, Pops and them
The brand new Benz off the lot with rims
And them Brooklyn Zu keep girls hot wit them
Like, Nina, Tanya and Kim
And they teach P.E. do squats in gym
And after the party, we party again
Send the waiters to the bar, get some juice and gin

[Chorus]

[Merdoc]
Give me a double shot of Henny and a red sight
Homey, if it's like bling, then we call it limelight
They told me shorty right there keep ya head tight
Now I'mma put my beard in it, get my head right
She told me that she all the way big, in my love life
Aiyo, whatever shorty give me, give it to her twice
Kicks the wife, beef alright
Fuck it, pop a couple bottles, it's a good night
Shorty move nice, make me wanna bite
She told me get a little piece, I think I just might
After club night, we can get a slice
Take it back to the crib, you can spend the night

[Chorus]

[Buddha Monk]
See those Zu dudes I roll wit, move wit ghost skit
When approach drip, D's look for snakes and clip
By that time, I'm in the club, Patron sip, looking for zone six
My tongue sick, so look for candle all lit
Can you smell what the Monk is cooking? I rebuild your home improvement
Ya'll can talk then ass losing, krush grooving
In the club, two-step, while lights be ruthless
As move left, there he is, one-two step
Meanwhile, keep my eyes on who's who, locate my Zu dudes
Against fool, click-click, get rude
It's the rotten apple from the barrel
Looking at Victoria Secret models, backshot, she swallow

[Chorus 3X]</pre>
