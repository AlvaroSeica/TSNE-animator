Yeah, uh, OHHH!!
[Omarion shouts something]
Let's go

[Omarion - Verse 1]
I love how you doing the things you do
Ghetto girl with the braids and the Nike shoes
I don't mean no disrespect to you
But a nigga really tryna fuck wit you
See you looking at me with those hazel eyes
Big chest, Big butt, and those big ol' thighs
All eyes on you and that's fo' sho
You shakin' it like you in my video

[Chorus]
Mami shake it, mami twork it
Girl I lovin' the way you work it
So mami can you take it off
That's all I really wanna do is see you take it off
Take it off, girl
Your body is bangin', girl, don't leave me hangin'
So mami can you take it off
That's all I really wanna do is see you take it off
Take it off, girl

[Verse 2]
Swinging your hips from left to right
I'm tryna leave this place with you tonight
Really wanna see you take it off for me
Love what you doin', when you doin' that shit for me
It be shakin' like a Polaroid picture
I'm just tryna get behind and grindin' wit cha
Up and down, round and round, side to side we go
Damn girl I gotta put you in my video

[Chorus]

[Mila J.]
Niggaz wanna cut, cut
'Cause I love the way ya bitch move that butt, butt
Haters throw ya hands up, chickens do the Cluck-Cluck
Jimmy Choos' got me walkin' with a mean strut
Sexy but I'm so rough
Now we bout to set it off
Long Island Iced Tea or a Smirnoff, this is a jump off
And we bout to take it off 
T.U.G., we in this bitch, we tear the roof off, fo', five let it off
Now we drinking, we getting our party on
The new tag team, Mila J. and Omarion
You ain't a balla wit spinners on ya neon
Wish you'd disappear like, "Poof! Be gone"
My team holds like 5 or 6 hoes
Haters try ta copy our style like Kinko's
Niggaz Lean Back, bitches Dip Low
If you can't do that, throw ya hands up let's go

[Chorus - 3X]</pre>
