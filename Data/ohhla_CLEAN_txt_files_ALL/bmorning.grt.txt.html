Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I think I see it now...

You see it, you see it
A beautiful morning
You see it, you see it
A beautiful morning
Its a beautiful morning
Have a nice day
Its a beautiful morning
Have a nice day

You see it, you see it
A beautiful morning
You see it, you see it
A beautiful morning
Its a beautiful morning
Have a nice day (yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Its a beautiful morning
Have a nice day

[Pigeon John]
Well I woke up in the morning
Couldn't sleep all night
All the pressures of the world
Pressing me to take flight
And the boulders on my shoulders
Weighing heavier than motors
All the quoters and reporters
Seem like they winning the fight
So I gotta pray to God
Shine the light on me
When I opened up my eyes
All my cares ran free
And I stood up in the mirror
Posing like a little G
I gotta feeling change is gonna come
Ya'll gone see... Ahhh

You see it, you see it
A beautiful morning
You see it, you see it
A beautiful morning
Its a beautiful morning
Have a nice day
Its a beautiful morning
Have a nice day

You see it, you see it,(I saw the sun come out)
A beautiful morning
You see it, you see it,(All the shadows riding way down south)
A beautiful morning
Its a beautiful morning (We about to walk it out walk it out)
Have a nice day (without a doubt)
Its a beautiful morning (Know what I'm talking about)
Have a nice day (I think I see a new...)

[Bonafide]
Its a beautiful morn
Though my body is worn
But my mind is at ease (yeah)
And I'm free of disease (ok)
Sieze the day and believe
Tomorrow will follow the lead
Indeed I'm destined for king (bleed)
(indiscernable)
It's a beautiful morn
Pray my babies come home
Angels keep 'em and watch 'em
When they facing the storm
Lord you know bout your boy
They been there for your boy
That's a prayer for your boy
Save a chair for your boy

You see it, you see it
A beautiful morning
You see it, you see it
A beautiful morning
Its a beautiful morning
Have a nice day
Its a beautiful morning
Have a nice day

You see it, you see it, (I saw the sun come out)
A beautiful morning
You see it, you see it, (All the shadows riding way down south)
A beautiful morning
Its a beautiful morning (We about to walk it out walk it out)
Have a nice day (without a doubt)
Its a beautiful morning (Know what I'm talking about)
Have a nice day (I think I see a new...)

[Coffee]
Pain by the broadside
And tyrant low riding
Vagrant taking where the sacred is skating
Waiting for the day to come (oh its coming soon!)
Tsunami monstrous monsoon
Take it head on
Riding on a pontoon
Put me in storm so perfect
Where I'm like "oh my God!"
Go beyond doomed
Often I complain (Ha!)
Though I'm a fool for that
Should know better by now (Ha!)
I went to school for that
Guess that's life
How would you react?
One thing, one thing, one thing though
Can't deny hood grace has
Stood all phases
Spacious living upgraded
To a house from rundown building
Live with feeling

You see it, you see it
A beautiful morning
You see it, you see it
A beautiful morning
Its a beautiful morning (I think I see it now)
Have a nice day
Its a beautiful morning (Ohh!)
Have a nice day (I think I see it now)

You see it, you see it, (Yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah)
A beautiful morning
You see it, you see it, (I think I see it now)
A beautiful morning
Its a beautiful morning
Have a nice day (I think I see it now)
Its a beautiful morning
Have a nice day

I saw the sun come out
All the shadows riding way down south
We about to walk it out walk it out
Without a doubt
Know what I'm talking about
I think I see a new day Yeah!
I think I see a new day Yeah!
I think I see a new day Yeah!
I think I see a new day Yeah!
I think I see it now</pre>
