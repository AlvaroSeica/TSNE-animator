Aiyyo, a lotta people been tryin to direspect 
Boogie Down Productions lately; I ain't widdit
KRS-One, Scott LaRock, D-Nice, those are homeboys knahmsayin?
My name is MC Mitchski
and they call me, 'The Rapping Comedian'
And just when you thought it was safe to go back to the Bridge..
Somethin happened

[Verse One]
MC Shan, your rhymes are through
"South Bronx" told you what to do
But it's {Brooklyn}'s turn, for us to burn
and earn and teach while you sit and learn
Now I don't come, to scream and shout
but to let you know what I'm talkin about
You can't come off so don't even try
But let me tell you the reasons why

Chorus: MC Mitchski and samples

{Brooklyn}.. blew up, "The Bridge!"
"South Bronx".. helped us out
{Brooklyn}.. blew up, "The Bridge!"
"South Bronx".. helped us out

	"Now that's what's happening!" -&gt; scratch 4X

[Verse Two]
MC Shan, you're not good lookin
If I'm correct, you lived in Brooklyn
Ran upstairs before it got dark
You used to play ball in Albany Park
You moved to Queens, what does that mean?
You still wearin Pumas and faded old jeans
You're down with Magic and the whole Juice Crew
but the only one they're juicin homeboy is you
You got a lot of records, I'm not impressed
Show me some dollars, let me see you dress
Let me ask a question, tell me how come
everytime you're on stage you look like a bum
I gotta let out, all my frustration
You don't even have a complete education
Come on stage, actin all fly
But let me give you another reason why

Chorus

	"Louder!" -&gt; scratch 3X

[Verse Three]
MC Shan, don't you know
I was at Union Square when you had a show
My homeboys said, "Yo he looks skinny"
A girlie said, "He would look good in a mini-skirt"
The brother didn't have on a shirt
Just a red and white Adidas jacket all full of dirt
He walked on stage like he was Casanova
When he said, "The Bridge"
They said, "The Bridge is Over"
When you hear this, don't get all wild
cause to me MC means you're My Child
If you wanna battle me, you must be dumb
cause you can't even hang, with KRS-One!

Chorus

	Oooh, this jam is fly.. (repeat 2X)
	Word..

[Verse Four]
MC Shan, your rhymes are through
"South Bronx" told you what to do
But it's {Brooklyn}'s turn, for us to burn
and earn and teach while you sit and learn
Now I don't come, to scream and shout
but to let you know what I'm talkin about
You can't come off so don't even try
But let me give you the reasons why

Chorus

[MC Mitchski]
In the place to be, MC Mitchski
The Rappin Comedian
And on his side, your Mellow Chief rockin the beat (??) radio
And on the wheels of steel we got, DJ (??)
Kickin it live in eighty-seven (you know it!)</pre>
