fuck whatever predicament
you niggas in
collar popped
aint a strongman alive in here can lift my grin
tip my brim
put the same scuffs on faces niggas get on tims
holla ock
we can battle for marrow
pharoah
shadowbox
static shock
I'm selecting ya regimen for disappearing
no remorse when I tell the kids about they missing parents
my retort
when its time for sport
is like some pistols airing
I tell that nigga "you better run or I'ma get you clarence"
I'm on that you aint never heard of it
burner spit murder shit
you speak but when I'm here you never utter a word of it
that ill collect the bounty shit
dead or alive
I stalk the county with
ammo to handle
you motherfuckers thats counterfeit
lets back to back it
count to six
I'm out this bitch</pre>
