(Intro)
Westside
East, to the fuckin South
Gangstas

(Verse 1)
Hoo-bangin like a G, ready to ride and regulate it all
Dippin is essential in the C. when I mad-dog
The khakis stay creased and we mob like the nazis
2 niggas are puttin it down, call us the twin John Gottis
See hoes on the dick and the hoes are ready to ride
But I don't see nothing wrong, so I hit and shake the spot
G's from the campus leavin a sample of pure funk
&gt;From the trunk to the ear as the 12 vegas bump
I make your head nod as we slide block to block, loc'
Chronic got me gone, crack the window to release the smoke
Shit, Rhimeson is seein demons
Cut the braids, hoes still fiendin for the semen and I'm schemin
It's action-packed shit for your whole fuckin clique
West Coast G's ain't the niggas to be fuckin with
S.C. Cartel dwells in the slums slangin crumbs
Test your vest, if you will I let this Nine steel hum
BiAtch

(Chorus)
All day everyday I don't give a fuck
Long as I got on my Khakis, T-shirt and Chucks
Rollin through L.A., what do I see ?       
A gang of mo' niggas dressed just like me
All day everyday I don't give a fuck
Long as I got on my Khakis, T-shirt and Chucks
Rollin through CHICAGO, what do I see ?
A gang of mo' niggas dressed just like me

(Verse 2)
Rollin in a low-low but I'm not solo
My heat is a H.K., underlay the plus A              
Cappin your ass quicker than a G
So that's who I rolls with when I'm twistin D's
My dress code's casual, you know the routine
Khakis, T-shirt and Chucks lookin hella clean
My low-low's wet, so what's next nigga
I can hit a switch and make you wreck nigga
Fuckin with a young vet nigga
Ain't nuthin goin on but the gangsta
South Central's finest, Murder Squad's finest
Try to take my low-low, I be seein 24 low-low
With a L, that's on my baby girl
You hear these bullets hummin, comin atcha
They'll snatch ya, caught up in a rapture
Fuckin with me the O.G. from the S.C., swap meet dweller
Quick to pull the heat in your cellar

(Chorus)
All day everyday I don't give a fuck
Long as I got on my Khakis, T-shirt and Chucks
Rollin through ATLANTA, what do I see ?
A gang of mo' niggas dressed just like me
All day everyday I don't give a fuck
Long as I got on my Khakis, T-shirt and Chucks
Rollin through ST.LOUIS, what do I see ?
A gang of mo' niggas dressed just like me

(Verse 3)
Ta-dow! How you like me now
As I skate in a rag 8 with Mc Eiht 
Collectin stripes, dumpin all night
We too tight as we ride, slide
With the heat on my side
A .45'll knock your ass closer to the sky
Nigga you best to break fast like juice
Lettin 32 loose from the carbon deuce-deuce
Fuck a truece, 'cause when I go y'all gots to bury me
In my Chuck T's, Khakis and B.V.T.
Y'all feelin me, still a G
Cold drop the four and roll to the store for 'gnac
I gets bent like that
Rata-tat-tat from Mac 10's, hit the corner and spin
On them D's, yellin: 'Fuck you G, nigga this's S.C.C.'
We regulates the S.C., I puts it down for C.C.
With baby Nine next to me fool, and when we dump
We're head-huntin for punks, so you better try
To play rug and lie

(Chorus)
All day everyday I don't give a fuck
Long as I got on my Khakis, T-shirt and Chucks
Rollin through TEXAS, what do I see ?
A gang of mo' niggas dressed just like me
All day everyday I don't give a fuck
Long as I got on my Khakis, T-shirt and Chucks
Rollin through OAKLAND, what do I see ?
A gang of mo' niggas dressed just like me
All day everyday I don't give a fuck
Long as I got on my Khakis, T-shirt and Chucks
Rollin through ILLTOWN, what do I see ?
A gang of mo' niggas dressed just like me
All day everyday I don't give a fuck
Long as I got on my Khakis, T-shirt and Chucks
Rollin through MACKTOWN, what do I see ?
A gang of mo' niggas dressed just like me
All day everyday I don't give a fuck
Long as I got on my Khakis, T-shirt and Chucks
All over the WESTCOAST, what do I see ?
A gang of G niggas dressed just like me</pre>
