Yea, election time is coming
Who you gonna vote for? Yea...

[Chorus]
If I was president, I'd get elected on Friday
Assassinated on Saturday
Buried on Sunday
They go back to work on Monday
If I was president (If I was president)
If I was president (If I was president)
If I was president (If I was president) yea...

[Verse One]
Instead of spending, billions on the war
I can use that money, so I can feed the poor
Cuz I know some so poor, when it rains that's when they shower
Scream and fight the power
That's when the vulture devour

[Chorus]

[Verse Two]
I know some soldiers, that sleep but they can't dream
Wake up with screams, sounds of M16's
So take this Medal of Honor, for you bravery
I wish you the best care, for you and your family

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
But the radio won't play this, they call it rebel music
How can you refuse it? Children of Moses
Tell the children the truth, the truth
It's not all that bling that's diamonds
Tell them the truth, the truth
Most of y'all where cubits of conium
Tell them the truth, the truth, YEAH!
Your soul is worth more than diamonds

If I was president
All blacks would have reparation no segregation
Feed the nation so there's no famine
Muslims, Jews, Christians, would all hold hands
Every week on the beach, party by the sand
Word up, take trips on Air Force One
Only to bring the homeless with no sneaks the Air Force Ones
Better schools in the hoods, better teachers in the classes
Making money paying no taxes
Find the best scientists, tell them come up with the answer
I want the cure for AIDS and cancer
But I gotta watch my back
The sniper's on the hill, with the still
Waiting to JF kill

[Chorus]

I feel the rain coming
Let me play my guitar for them right now, let's go
Refugees
YEAH!</pre>
