circa 1920
fly suit I sit
at the table in center of the room I'm in
long day of boardwalk empire bootleg work
I show my face in this place
just to case these jerks
fedora the explorer how I saw her in the corner
the room lit
who she with
I'm tryna score her
Jessica Rabbit dress
red pumps
brunette
lead singer of the set
responsible for two steps
shes the bees knees
plus the cats meow
the dogs bark
the cows moo
a rappers freestyle
I staggered
meanwhile
she entered the stage
as the curtains rose I froze
suspended in daze
the drummer started with his hi hat
I had to fan myself with my hat
Imagining her on my lap
I'm hoping I could have it
she opened with a ballad
sultry
her voice carried
I tried to grab it
but for nought
as it traveled so effortless
never before have I ever sought estrogen
this intense
shit id even be her misses bitch
gunshots couldn't stop the madness
thats it
she that sick
I'm private dick dragnet
for a split second we lock eyes
It's like a portal opened
to the moon outside
do I try
or do I ride
hmm
Its do it time
Its do or die
so I decide
exit the spot
and leave with my sanity
cause the real thing couldn't be as ill as the fantasy</pre>
