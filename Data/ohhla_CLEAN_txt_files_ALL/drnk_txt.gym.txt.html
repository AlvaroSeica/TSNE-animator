[Travie McCoy]
AhhhhhI usually avoid any type of confrontation
Conversation, in moderation
Lips sealed but my fingers are flyin
As the hours pass they grow more impatient
My phone is mad lettered, especially when I'm sauced up
And I admit that I'm ashamed
But there's Melissa, Theresa, and Emily - what a toss-up!
But that's the best part of the game
And I'm really a novice aspirin alcoholic
Drownin the day's pain in hops, barley and grain
Thinkin of ways to convince one to join me
in the company of low lifes all doin the same
So - I start textin (ay) I keep textin
Hey! I can't stop it's my obsession
Yep, it's like fishin, my words are like lures
If they bite the bait cool, if not call it a night

[Chorus]
We can't, more like we shouldn't
And I know...
And I try, to be a good boy
But it's hard...

(I start textin, I keep textin)
(I can't stop it's my obsession)

[Travie McCoy]
Now ask yourself this - is love a tender thing?
Too rough? Too rude? Too boisterous?
Well - I'll tell you what man, I had it once and
it was fun but not enough
'Tis torture, and not mercy
Heaven is where my phone lives
In my pocket, so cozy
Oh what a joy replies give
It seems Melissa's babysittin and Theresa's workin late
But Emily's on her way to East 11th on the train
And that's when I remember Patty from West Philly
She said I'm in your area three minutes away
So - I stop textin, no more textin
Yep, it's like fishin, my words are like lures
If they bite the bait cool, if not call it a night

[Chorus] - 2X

(I start textin, I keep textin)
(I can't stop it's my obsession)

[Patty Crash]
I know you think I'm wreckless, move so fast
Slow down! I think I love so I told him by the inter-text message
He wrote back, "Me too!
I was just sittin' here thinkin 'bout you"
I know I want him but I can't and I shouldn't
Tried to put my phone down, damn! But I couldn't
Stayed on the phone with him all night long
Text message when I'm gone

[Chorus] - 2X</pre>
