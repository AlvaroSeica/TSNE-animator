Song:   Johnny Rotten
Typed by: PremRock 

It' s that rap punk shit
Wyle out act drunk 
and smash pumpkins
Got the style out to crash functions
How you punks like you got bars
I'm Johnny Rotten body rockin' on top of cop cars
Fuck party like a rock star
I party like Charlie Parker with veins full of hot tar
Just kidding
But I'm know to push the limits
Apply to all you critics "Uh Huh," that's how I did it
Your'e a centipede, a microbe, a local joint
I'm the center piece, the maestro the focal point
Morris Day riding shotgun feeling like a pimp
sipping on that Red Label shit like that's it
Like how you got grooves when you got no Drummer
The head of the class heading to Clash like Joe Strummer
Oh bummer just another cold summer
For no hit wonders, no shit ,no wonder
No grip so you prone to slip and go under
Underneath her dress slip she slipped her phone number
Now.PremRock now tis tisk
Sorry I'm not sorry I bring it sharp to your chest
Like Elliot Smith, bitch

Chorus (2X)

We get it poppin'
Keeping the beats knockin'
Breaking creating moshin'
Take it, changing the topics
We've never stoppin'
You jockin'
Passing judgment and watchin'
Like "you should slow down. "
FUCK YOU!  Johnny Rotten

Shit I'm Chris Cornell before the haircut
While your snare's use nair
Quit using our damn air up
Our percussion love dirt
Put your drums in the earth
Let's bang out!
I don't care whatever works
How you claiming you, claiming you buck wild
looking like Clay Aiken and Amy Grants love child
You're just a minor threat 
I got major promise
brain cells are sharp think with serrated logic
Sid Vicious with an MPC Kicking
Like Mr. Business Man, Mr.  none of yo Business!
Bukowski, zooted and  too rowdy
Dissing the crowd till they start to boo loudly
DimeBag Darrel on a grindtime panel
With that primetime, stay fly, A.I. handle
Keith Richards, hella-buzzed
The type of jam fellas love 
3/5's knee deep in a pool of cheap liquor
PremRock rock y'all till the octave break
spit prose with a pro's claim how we proclomate
Novocaine to you slow lane macho fakes
I spread the cool out now watch me oscillate
Orson Welles to the airwaves, panic when I speak
Titanic any fleet,
damage any beat
From Manchester to Manitoba
The Hannibal Lector, facial texture
with no PR damage controller
