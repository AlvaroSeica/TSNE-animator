[Intro: Free Murda]
Yea, turn my mic up loud, you know
And my earphone, put the level in
And let me take these young boys to school
Knowhatimean, Division...

[Hook: Free Murda]
This F-R Double E, out of curse
I'm still Lil' Free, but Murda
B-R Double O K-L-Y-N
M-I-Double D L-E, got it
Now shorty, go gold, he gon' be aight
This one is going home, to Fort Greene, aight
And cassette, for my toes, to or to clean my Nikes
Forty 'matic chrome, help me sleep at night

[Free Murda]
Breathe, inhale, then exhale
Ya'll ain't gon' succeed, tryin' to exhale
Nigga showing they ass, forgot sex sales
Bout to flip like that door on the Nextel
Nigga knock on my door, for tech shells
Little dumb ass nigga ain't aimed the tech well
Dropped a hit, little kids, now can't catch spells
You came straight to the crib, like FedEx mail

[Chorus 2X: Free Murda]
You can never be better than me
You can never be better than Free
You can never be better than me
Baby, baby, no better than Free
