[Saigon]
Somethin like a buddy, didn't really love me
You made my lifestyle ugly man, you wasn't my (friend)
I trusted and believed in you man
I ignored all the people who said (watch out for your friend)
I used to try to watch for the cops; but my pops said
"Brian you should stop, you should watch for your (friend)"
I wish I woulda listened to him
He said friends (sometimes they'll try, and make you sin)
You made me not only sin; you made my temper shorter than Napoleon
Would shoot whenever you told me when
Met you when I was only 10, now it's only been
2 and half years since I left you and I'm lonely and
I ain't gon' lie, sometimes when I'm alone
I wanna pick up the phone like, "Wha- whattup homes?"
Instead I go in the zone and spit poems into microphones
Fuckin wit'chu is nuttin to do but I'll be callin Riker's home
You insisted on making me sin
You ain't love me, you was making pretend
You wasn't my (friend) my Auntie, my Uncle and them
They used to tell me again and again (watch out for your friend)
My momma couldn't never comprehend
Said you won't even do it for me, but you'll do it for your (friend)
Wish I woulda listened to them
They said friends (sometimes they'll try, and make you sin)

You ain't no friend of miiiine - hell nah
You a waste of my time (watch out for ya - sin)
You ain't no friend of miiiine - hell nah
You a waste of my time (watch out, for your friend)
(Sin, watch out for ya - sin) (Sin)
(Watch out, for your...)</pre>
