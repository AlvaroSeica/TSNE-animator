[ CHORUS: Necro ]
We'll kill you
We'll kill you
We'll kill you
We'll kill you and enjoy it
We'll kill you
We'll kill you
We'll kill you
We'll kill you and enjoy it
We'll kill you

[ VERSE 1: Necro ]
My Death Rap style's the best shit you ever heard in your life
You get killed like a child molester, murder you with a knife
Now you nothing but a pile of intestines
Time to celebrate, fiesta, forever, dead
Whatever you said, whatever, I don't give a fuck what you think
Run up on you, put the gun up to you, run that
Sonny, give me the money or dummy, you gon' hear the gun clap
Pop! Goes the weasel, snitch
Rat, hit you with a bat, bitch
I'm a put you in a ditch, pistol-whip you with a gat
Butcher you to death, faggot, this shit's crystal crack
Rap crucifixion, addiction to cash
Pimp sluts, make 'em put dicks in their ass
TrixÂ­ are for kids, I rock Necro fitted lids
Peace to convicts doin bids
I'm like the comic character Grips
Or Wolverine, I rips your flesh to bits, then I dip
Like a thief in the night, if we got beef, we'll fight
Whoever want it, could get it, set it, aight?

[ CHORUS: Necro ]

[ VERSE 2: Kool G Rap ]
Bitch motherfucker, get laid on your back
Disco lights, red rays on your hat
Predator attack, leave the prey in my tracks
Stray cats, run and get strays and collapse
Innocent victim, hit 'em, you go with him
Eat 'em up, shit 'em out, spit 'em like jism
Fuck homie, I don't dig him, forget him
Maybe the Lord forgive him when he with him
Chrome spin, opponents in moments
Blade sharp like a Ronin's
The Lone Wolf roamin, mouth foamin like dogs in The Omen
You want war, your front door get blown in
Murder in motion, kid, that's the slogan
Play slug proof, I'll loosen a ligament
Troops in the trench, straight-faced trigger men
Gorillaed to death
Push the right side of your face out of place, just a little to the left
Shit out the Tec, sizzlin your flesh
EMS, send a charge in your chest
East, far as the west, Godfathers the best
