II Tru's comin' to get ya fools
Nothin' but the best females
This remains, not nothin'
But the females caught in the rapture
Recognize II Tru's comin' to get ya fools

[Cabrina]
Come let a sista break you off with true flex
Straight off the View
I'm housin' crazy fools straight servin' bread
So, let me make grand entrance
II Tru's comin' to get ya fools
Leavin' 'em clues, but layin'
'Cause you playin', sold no dues
Buyin' a ?, some kneel before a sista
Had to break your backside for underestimatin'
II Tru playas on this rap vibe
With skills they be flippin' the script
Regardless Mo Thug got my back, you hold that
You catch a sista slippin' on these hard raps
Ain't  no ? with a sista leakin' honestly speakin'
Gotta use they gift of flow to flip my dough
'Til I reach my peak, man
Comin' up with skills on the real, though
It don't stop, sista thought you knew this
AJay comin' back up tight with this beat for the score II
Tru hits

(Chorus):
This remains, not nuthin' but best females caught in the rapture
Recognize II Tru's comin' to get ya fools

[Jhaz]
Well, it's Jhaz, comin' at you megablast
You don't want to see these skills corrupt the mic
My lyrics kill on the real
Don't underestimate 'cause I'm a lady
You must be crazy, don't play me short
'Cause the az will fade these on
And from the weed, inhalin' all the chronic
Blazed forever dazed
II Tru comin' at through your phonics, so smoke it
Put it on my grave, II Tru high
I said it, I meant it
Pay attention, child, there's value to this lesson
No question my bag is tight in any situation, dope
My camp is real trues, no need for perpetratin'
Flossin', but you know I never change
I'm still that same old Jhaz them St. Clair streets
With a pocket full of cash, fool
A true forever, don't forget it
II Tru all through my blood, understand?
Don't disrespect it

(Chorus)

[Cabrina]
Comin' straight off Clearview
Understand, man, I gotsta serve ?
It means that flow that we sistas droppin'
II Tru gain much respect
In this game of deals
who gonna be that fool to get served? (With nerve...)

[Jhaz]
...With nerve enough to test trues
This mack ten's all you deserve, word, but...

[Cabrina]
...on the real these skills ain't nothin' funny
Got lyric for days
But you best believe it's about that money (money)

[Jhaz]
Suddenly, let my mood groove you
School you, teach you the way of the trues
So go your own path, silly child
Guaranteed in the end I swear you lose

[Cabrina]
Fool, recognize this set up
We females gettin' stupid on the rhyme styles we kickin'
Really ain't nothin' to it
II Tru's got what you're lookin' for
Long of a way to drama
Stackin' loot for them tape sales
Said before, we gots no problem
In the C a game of flexin'
You play the rules, you lose

[Jhaz]
Choose wisely, second guess my flex
Bow down so to praise these trues

(Chorus)
Nothin' but the females (caught in the rap shit)</pre>
