[Joss Stone - Verse 1ne] (Common)
You don't have to make your mind up
I just wanna take my time, with you (Yeah...)
If that's alright - it's alright, alright (It's cool)
Ooh, forgive me if I get too shy, but (word)
maybe you're the reason why, love, (uh..)
I'm feelin butterflies... (I feel it too, uh)
Somethin about the look in your eyes
Uh-huh oooh, ooh it just makes me feel so right
Ohh-ho-ho-ohhh...

[Chorus]
When my mind's void, you're my joy
You're the dreaaaam, when I sleep
And hey I'm for ya, yeah I adore ya
You're everythiiiing that I need
And love how you love meeee
If I'm made for you, you're made for me
It's too good to be
So tell me what you're gonna do now
Uh, uh, uh
Yeaaaah, tell me what we're gonna do now
Uh, uh, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2wo] (Common)
Funny how my world keeps spinning
Sometimes you can be so silly 
You know just how to make me laugh (Eheheheh, yeah)
Ooh...your skin is so lovely
It moves me when you touch me
I know that you got my back  (True indeed yes I do)
It feels so safe when you hold me, mmm
It's already like you know me

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Whoa-hoa-ohhhh, right now
See baby I love, how you make me smile
Don't leave, please staaaay a while
Uh, let's make this happen I DON'T CARE HOW, ohh

[Common - Rap verse]
Right now, let's stay in the present
Can't worry about tomorrow 'cause today is a blessin
The world in a state of aggression
I find calm in you, I see my mom in you
It's like the feelin in ya stomach when you want it so bad
If we keep keeping it fresh it ain't gonna go bad
I've been through the valley of love
Rode through shores of Cali just to find piece of mind
Lookin to the sky, askin for at least a sign
Beautiful you came at such a decent time
When we combine it's like good food and wine
Flavorful yet refined, you remind me of the divine 
So easy, love can be lost and then found like Stevie
I just love having you around
You wearin the gown, I'm wearin the crown
Pound for pound, we the freshest couple in town

[Chorus]

[Joss Stone]
Tell me what we're gonna do
Tell me what we're gonna do noooooow-owww...
Mmmmmmm-oooooh...
Uh-huh, tell me what we're gonna do now
Umm, uh-huh
Uh, uh, uh, uh, yeaaaaah
Uh-huh, uh, uh, uh, yeaaaaah
Tell me what we're gonna do</pre>
