Will I be rated as one of the greatest rappers on the planet.. I doubt it!
Will Mark be rated as on e of the greatest producers.. I doubt it!
It's not 'cause we ain't good
It's 'cause we're from London that means we're stigmatised
We can't be original, to hell with that prehistoric thinking
Just because your ship's sinking it doesn't necessarily mean that ours is
I'm known for Carhartt jeans, not ties and trousers
Your life style is safe as houses, mine is unorthodox
Aural ecstasy.. we never had no videos on the box
Rap's Rambo! One man army had it with your mumbo jumbo
Switching roles now I'm Columbo
Investigating the scene, exposing all perpetrators
How dare you compare yourself to Jesus claiming you came to earth to save us
Step to the centre stage when you see me yell May Day
We ain't here to play, we're here to slay, you better pray
You can bring Robocop, Terminator, Superman, Batman
But none of them could handle this madman

(chorus)
You don't see the signs because you're blind
You're running out of time, I'm losing my mind, it's a crime
Stand back and watch a professional rapper rhyme
Put the mic down boy, the show is mine

I don't have time to worship idols.. that's for idiots
Triple check the ingredients, strictly no chameleons
On a scale of one to ten you're a zero, nothing
Learn before you shoot your mouth off, try to give 'em something
To think about! Work your brain muscles. This hustler hustles
Daily from the second the sun rises till it's gone again
The arrival of the full moon means it's time to perform again
The damage is done with one performance then I'm off again
If something ain't correct we cut it off from the stem
It'll be the same the next month.. warn your men
Cordon off your area in your feeble attempts
To try to catch this superior rhymer that's out to bury ya!
In the confusion you're all about to witness the birth of
A showdown, a monumental throwdown
I got the world in the palm of my hands
And as things stand I intend to steal your fans
From under your nose whether you're friends or foes
I've been watching you! You been looking dead at your shows
And as it goes you're the cons who've been acting as pros
One of the days you'll be exposed!

(chorus)

Lets be realistic you ain't artistic. You're simplistic
Ripping off songs that already existed. You go ballistic
When we tell you the facts, play the evidence you lose control of your emotions
Couldn't hack it 'cause you think the world should rotate around what you do
But you're sadly mistaken
Here's a rude awakening.. You ain't gonna win!
This whole game's full of amateurs, fake characters,
Human beings acting mechanical, enter the cannibals
That's us! The mission is to crush with the least amount of fuss
Turning leeches into dust 'cause it's a must
He's a beat programmer, I'm a savage and my
Weapon's grammar, you're the nail, I'm the hammer
Backstabbers don't survive long when my mic's on
Hypocrites are paralysed, crushed by the unknown
Destroyer destroying phoneys.. those that act up
Step to the front but bring your back up</pre>
