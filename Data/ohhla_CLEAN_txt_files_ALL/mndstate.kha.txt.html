Typed by: DaSun Akbar

[Tragedy Khadafi]
Yo, I go in like an intravenous needle filled wit ghost saga
'Hotel Rwanda' Don Cheadle type aura
Blowing AR's at the White House
A million Bloods at the Pentagon
Wit their flags out, total wipeout
I be that G that they're fearing
Slug proof European, barking on the state
Styling on Congressional Hearings
Spit that gourmet, hood saut√©, exotic gun play
Grace the floors of Supreme Court Halls
Khadafi shutting down microwave rap
It's yours, Grand Imperial goons
Half of those hardcore rap fiends
Catch the Sheikh's like heroin in the spoon
Queensbridge known for spraying off infrared heataz
The most gracious revolutionary gangstaz swerving two-seataz

(Hook Samples *Scratched*)
"Tragedy is the name figure I just stroll my yard"
"Jus Allah, even tho I play wit a .9"
"I'm the"
"Gangstaz dream while FEDS nightmare"
"Sha Illuminati"
"Gangstaz dream while FEDS nightmare"
"Tragedy is the name"
"Gangstaz dream while FEDS nightmare"
"Sha Illuminati"
"Gangstaz dream while FEDS nightmare"

[Killa Sha]
Yo, infinite brain cells, King'll rebel
Dominant male, Illuminati hammer and nails
Hand ova hand, mute niggas colorful speech
You're not in my reach; send the orders out from deep
The all true and living, possess third eye vision
Journey the mission, maneuver well thru conditions
'07 2-5 Expedition, ammunition locked and loaded in position
4th Disciple bang heavy on percussions
Daily discussion, getting paid wit the Russians
Break bread for the mentally dead
Mix my haze wit a lil bit of med
Fuck the FEDS, Haile Selassie
Peace to the Foul Mahdi
Bloody rowdy is running rapid inside parties
The oldest General, Killu remains imperial
I eat cats like Lucky Charms cereal

(Hook Samples *Scratched*)
"Sha Illuminati"
"Gangstaz dream while FEDS nightmare"
"Tragedy is the name"
"Gangstaz dream while FEDS nightmare"
"Sha Illuminati"
"Gangstaz dream while FEDS nightmare"
"FEDS nightmare"</pre>
