[Intro: Apocalipps]
Aiyo, why you give this nigga Truck the keys, man?
Yo, why the fuck you give this nigga the keys, man, what the fuck
Just the whip!

[Truck]
I'm doing bout 90 on the BQE
I got shorty in the front seat, freaking me
I'm like slow down bitch, 'fore I crash the V
Ooh-wee, got me feeling like I'm Master P
Should of saw the small blunts, she was passing me
And never so many cars, they was passing me
I had my, foot on the gas, my hand on the wheel
I had my, hand on her ass, I"m fonding her tits
(Iron Mic: Aiyo, shit is that real?) Nigga, shit been real
Ever since I left Now Born, five in the morn'
I was up in the club, nigga, getting it on
Remember, my back to the bump, my back to the bump
Now I'm getting ass in the car, almost crashing the car
You know I'm fucked up from all this grass in the jar
Don't ask me where I'm going, I don't care how far
Cuz my navigation, reach no destination
I pulled over to the nearest gas station
No gas to pump, just ass to pump
I had her legs wide open, with her ass in the trunk
She was breathing so hard, she need an ashtma pump
She said Truck, please stop, let's take a time out
I smoked some more weed, then I blew her spine out
Talking bout she hungry, shit, she wanna dine out
I don't trick on the first date, boo, let me find out

[Chorus: Apocalipps]
Pull them cars over, when the Truck's coming through
Don't let me make a wild nigga put a slug in you
Ruthless, and we bring out the thug in you
Nigga what you wanna do, bitches you up in this crew?</pre>
