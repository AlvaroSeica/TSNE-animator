[Intro: Big K.R.I.T.]
Good Lord, we back one mo' again
This for the people, this for the have-nots
I know what you're going through
I know what you're dealing with on the daily, you feel?
Ain't nothing but sunshine from here, let's get high

[Chorus]
Sipping on this drank won't ease my pain
Lord, I wish it would
Smoking all this weed don't make me sane
But it should
In a world that's down and out, out
In a world that's down and out, out
Ohhh-oh-oh-oh

[Big K.R.I.T.]
I got my back against the wall, once again I've been cornered
Smoke that roach from my ash tray from the other day, and down this last Corona
that I scrape fo', gotta make mo', gotta get mine, cause when I get time I'ma get shine
and clear my runway, and wait till I get signed
Then stretch my wings and fly, do what I gotta do to get by
See the world through my third eye, would answer the things I worry about
At the end of days, bills to pay, if it's a white man world am I still a slave to the minimum wage?
Keep word minimal, subliminal, cause I won't make it anyway
out the traps they set, follow them tracks they left to the White House
And tell Oprah Winfrey I don't need no chicken, bitch they gon' turn my lights out
on a daily basis, piece of American Pie they cut me, I can barely taste it
But I know it ain't bout shit cause my grandma ain't make it, yeah

[Chorus]

[Big K.R.I.T.]
Can't take that for granted though, I'm still searching for antidotes
Niggas out chere sick from the money they spent, tryna get more cars and clothes and hoes
They really know their pose, is that on Earth winning y'all?
Is every woman in a sundress really down for the cause?
I can't be sure, nowadays everybody bout dough
About the play, a queen to be? A gold digger? I can't even say
But either way I strap up, wrap up, cause I don't want no capsules after
a rock-a-bye that I deny cause she stay on heads like tassels
And that's not to say ain't no queens around my way
I seen one the other day, but she had bruises on her face, and cried to me
that men ain't shit, and she fed up, they only want her with her legs up
Even though her nose swollen and eye was closed, I told her keep her head up, and she said

[Chorus]</pre>
