Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Chorus]
Far, far away, far away, far away (you feel so)

Far, far away, far away, far away

[Lecrae]
Hopeless, I can spell it, I can smell it in the air
Lotta people wonder if you still care
And are you still there, cause I lost it all
I keep calling your name, but do you hear my call
and are you still involved, at home I'm left alone
I wander the streets, cause I no longer have a home
My brothers all GONE! My sisters all GONE!
My family and my friends ain't gon' be here in the mornin
You see me here mournin
They say you feel my pain, they say you went through it
Say die is to gain
But I ain't gave nothing, I lost everybody
Now I'm loosin' my mind and my faith is all I got
I'm still holding on, that's why I still pray
Feelin' empty inside, I can't make it through the day
I don't know what else to do, I don't know what else to say
I'm talking to you now, but I promise that you feel so FAR

[Chorus]
Far, far away (you seem) far away (you seem) far away (so, so)
Far, far away (you feel) far away (you seem) far away (so, so)
Far-Far, far away (you feel) far away (you seem) far away (you're so, so)
Far, far away (you feel) far away (you seem) far away (so...)

[Lecrae]
Dead hopin waitin only for a while now
Because the beat that I ain't sure if I can smile now
Look at this devestation, look at the pain and sorrow
Somebody fed me lies and promise me a bright tomorrow
I know the God I follow, is bigger than disaster
Big enough to handle any evil that harass us
But I feel like he passed us, Pain overtook us
Buildings tumbled over head as the ground shook us
God adieu forsook us
Are ya still with me?
I know you save souls, I trust you to forgive me
Relief can you hear me? Hey rest can you give me
Hey peace can you see me, hey Love can you hear me
I don't know what to do I ain't lookin' for answers
I just need you to hold my hand through this cancer
Tell me you never left, even in the midst of death
Breathe on me I'll do anything to feel your breath!

[Chorus]
Far, far away (ya feel) far away (you're so) far away (so, so)
Far, far away (you feel) far away (you seem) far away (you're so, so)
Far, far away (you feel) far away (you seem) far away (you're so, so)
Far, far away (you feel) far away (you seem) far away (you're so...)

[Lecrae]
For God alone
Oh my soul, wait in silence
For my hope is from him
He is my only rock and my salvation
My fortress - I shall not be shaken
On God rests, my salvation, my glory
My mighty rock, my refuge is God
Trust in him at all times people
Pour your heart out before him
God is a refuge for us
... ye

[Chorus]
far, far away (he's not!) far away (he's not!) far away (he's not! - you know my god! is not!)
far, far away (he's not!) far away (he's not!) far away (he's not! - you know my god! is not!)
far, far away (he's not) far away (no. he's not) far away (my god is not!)
far, far away (he's not) far away (he's not!) far away (he's not)... yeh!

[Lecrae]
we love you lord, we love you lord
we trust that you are not that far away
we love you lord, we love you lord
we trust that you are not that far away
help us be the church
help us be the church...
to love your people
as they love the world

Amen</pre>
