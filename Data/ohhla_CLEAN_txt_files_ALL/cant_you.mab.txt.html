(Texas Tantrum)
My life, Guerilla Maab on the rise
Can't you see, can't yooooou seeee

[Hook: Texas Tantrum - 2x]
Can't you see, the life of a G
Can't you see, the pain on the streets
Can't you see, can't you see
What's troubling me

[Trae]
Get up out of my nightmare
I gotta get up, out of my dreams
Feeling the pains of hard times, and live in the streets
The murder rate increase, everytime I go to sleep
And everybody that I love, done came up deceased
A nigga see the struggle, and I wanna make it out
What's making me feeling worse, I'm dying without a doubt
Stress fucking me up, and running me to the ground
And even partnas be faking, when they be coming around
You niggaz can't relate, to living the broke life
When you praying to the Lord, that it be alright
Just to make it through the night, and see another day
And on the real, we be living it in the worst way

[Dougie D]
Next up in this motherfucking thang, taking a swang
And leaving niggaz, with motherfucking stains on brains
Sick of the drama, and sick of the past
Sick of motherfuckers acting feminine, and they only be faking
After all the shit, that we done seen and fight fo'
Hold they heads high, real rhymes to ride to
Never be another set, of motherfuckers
That'll be jumping up on the microphone, wrecking it the way we do
Young and black, broke and going through thangs
It's the money and the cars, and not milk it mayn
On a constant grind daily, to maintain
Doing all I can, to break bread and stay sane

[Hook - 2x]

[Dougie D]
Or can you tell me, what life like in the limelight
For everyday people, struggling just to eat right
On the cold of the night time, to the daylight
Gotta stay on my grind, and make sure that my child tight
I've been living my lifestyle, on the wild side
I've been carrying a glock nine, to protect mine
Fuck around with the Maab nigga, bitches is gon mind
Just the way that we gotta go get it, and get down
With some motherfucking thug niggaz, rough niggaz
Pulling pistols up out the draws nigga, bust niggaz
And it burn, when I pull a glock to rush niggaz
We forever gon keep a point nigga, what nigga

[Trae]
And how we spitting our game, and ducking the fed time
My nigga Donnie D, done made the headlines
I don't wanna see my nigga, locked up for lifetime
Best run up in the jail, in ten in Ridgetown
And go on a rampage, you niggaz already know
We living the last days, you know that I don't play
So give me the twin gauge, somebody gon feel the heat
When I'm going in a rage, a right to wanna pager
Think I'm going insane, my mind is untamed
With nobody to blame, I feel I can't change
And sick of living in pain, you motherfuckers
Gon pay, for every single thang

[Hook - 2x]
