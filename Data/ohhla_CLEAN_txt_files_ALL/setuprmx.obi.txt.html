[Obie Trice talking]
Oh oh oh oh oh, Ohhhbiiiiiiiie (hehehehe)
Detroit nigga!

[Obie Trice]
+Cheers+ the debut, the nigga the voice the career, it's all new (yup)
You pupp-ular phew-ass niggas love your boo when I thugged in school (huh)
Made her resort to fuck with niggas like you (hah!)
Me, I gave her obstical courses
Bust nuts up in that ass, (yeah) lots of abortions
You, took it out of proportion
Made the bitch wifey, when you should be plottin' divorcin'
I put it through the ring, had her wallet and horse, when
You, bought rings, had her hiding out in Nordstrom
A culture, help a playa apart
Catch these bars, you know I play her like a sport (hah!)
Obie is never that nigga paying for that loft
Payin' the cause for another man to floss (nah!)
I'd rather have my hands on the grands of course
So the plan is creepin' up on your man, pushing The Porsche (what!)

[Chorus - Nate Dogg] (Obie Trice) {Redman}
Thick thighs but she full of surprises
I swear this bitch is +Shady+ (that's what I know)
Sex on her mind all the time
And you think that, that's your baby (you don't know)
You a good guy that's living the life
But she dove and played your safety (that's what I know)
If you cool and she satisfied {I know +Dat bitch+}
How come that bitch just paged me? (you don't know)

[Redman]
Ey yo, Obie Trice, I know the same bitch (the same bitch)
The bitch with the ear-ring and the clit (+Dat Bitch+?)
I got photos with her buttnaked
with Manolo's and a pair of handcuffs on her hip (ey yo)
She love coke, doin' lines off my CD (sniff sniff)
She in the bottles like Audrey Magini
She got a G.A.D. from nightschool
That stands for "Gettin' Anybody Dolla", greeeedy!
I first met her at Magic City, she was gettin' lapdances, and grabbin' titties
When the stripper ain't lookin', she grabbed her $50
Ride out the bitch thong, when the song is on
I'm like: +Dat Bitch+ ain't shit!
She'll put the gun to your balls while swallowing your "kids"
Before you know it, you got roooobbed
By four fat chicks that kicked in your door while you was tired
That's the game +Dat Bitch+ is playin'
Watch her back while they walkin' your way
You know her, long hair brown skin
Pussy be whippin' niggaz like Lady Heroine
You try to get her drunk, she slipped two of "Mickey's"
Now you the next date-rape victim on Rickie
Bitch fuck with D, I have her leg +hangin' out the trunk+ like the
+Marshall Mathers LP+ (yup!)

[Chorus - Nate Dogg]

[Lloyd Banks]
Yeah, Lloyd Banks'll never trust a hoe (no)
They'll get you +Set Up+ fast, +puttin' your hands in the air+ like
Busta's show (yeah)
I got the fame, name, plus the dough
Between your legs and your chin is a few places my nuts'll go (hoe!) (hah!)
I'm stubborn in the worst way, so I don't follow up if I don't get the
pussy the first day (yeah)
Hey, slow down boo, is that a G-Unit party ?
My niggaz pattin' the hoes down too (yeah)
They're hungry and they're plannin' to profit
So I get all my hoodrat head with my hand outta my pocket
They scheme, but the cannon'll stop it
Thinkin' I'm offpoint cuz I blew about a grand on a chocolate
And even if I'm loose off the liqour (liquor)
I'm reachin', besides everything's bulletproof but my zipper (ziiip!)
I don't even put my drink down, watch the bitch on your arm
She probably goin' through your mink now (Lloyd Banks nigga!)

[Chorus - Nate Dogg]

[Jadakiss]
Yo, if you say "Kiss is the best", you're not hypothetically speakin'
Beyond doubt, I bet he be leakin' (D-Block!)
And I'm in the zone right now, I think I'm 'bout to finish up my album
by the rest of the weekend (let's go)
It's a dirty game, and rule number one
you never spend clean money on a dirty dam√® (yeah)
Bitches pointing like "Oh, he Kiss!"
Once they get a whip for the purple kush and a OG Crip
Got a hazespot with dubs and a whole D strip
I get it for cheap, the 'ricans throw me shit
My nigga listen, it's enough of 'em (uhh)
So you don't gotta be runnin' around here all crazy, lovin' 'em and
coughin' 'em (New York)
Just don't add up, (naw)
she just wanna get her hair and nails done, and tear Fifth Ave up
She might cop female 'Gators
Bad thing's the homie gonna spend her like Spreewells later
Now everything is messed up (yeah)
You wanna deck him, then deck her
Should have only used her from the neck up (woo)
Instead of taking her to shop's
Take her scandalous ass to +The Doc+, make her get a check up
Not for nothing, you should just stand down
Cuz before long, there's gonna be a man down
But naww, you gave her the world
She gave you her ass and then to Kiss
And she still your favorite girl, damn!

[Chorus - Nate Dogg]

[Obie Trice talking]
