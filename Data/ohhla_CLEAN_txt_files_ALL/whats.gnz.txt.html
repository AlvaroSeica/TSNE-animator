[Peter Gunz]  
B-X  
[Pharrell Williams]  
Oh you gangster now  
[Peter Gunz]  
Brooklyn  
[Pharrell Williams]  
Word!  
[Peter Gunz]  
Harlem  
[Pharrell Williams]  
You aint gangster nigga  
[Peter Gunz]  
QB  
[Pharrell Williams]  
We seen you in the hood  
[Peter Gunz]  
Staten Isl.  
[Pharrell Williams]  
But I'm Now  
[Peter Gunz]  
Jersey, Philly  
[Pharrell Williams]  
All the mother fuckers in the hood that's really ghetto and gangster  
[Peter Gunz]  
L-T, P-G  
[Pharrell Williams]  
Bring it from the top  

[Peter Gunz]  
If you mad and you hatin' mother fucker please kill it  
You know Neptunes is hot like skillets  
Your ego's scared then nigga please go heal it  
That tight ass fitted cap the dogs will peel it  
Long as the Bronx still got me and New York still feel it  
For the jump off, jump off niggas best to kill 'em  
Ay yo Gunz you change let's make it rain you conceited  
Naw still got a 9 girl and Peter still eatin'  
I'm just another nigga from the hood in the car  
Six double zero bikes double the R  
See them dogs draped in red cover the bar  
See them cowards be in the club trouble we are  
I smokes no drugs just Henney no chase  
Foot on the throttle with models giving me face  
Like Oochie Wally Wally she gave me lolly lolly  
Now you wanna polly polly holla if you hear me y'all  

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams &amp; (Lord Tariq]  
Uptown what is that sound (let 'em know)  
Harlem what is that sound (I wanna know)

[Lord Tariq]  
Yo, if you mad and you hatin' muh fucker please kill it  
Tariq and P. G. 'bout to drop gots to feel it  
Dogs on call blood 'bout to spill it  
Sound view nigga, BX the realest  
Spent the illest hours on the block moving powder  
And back up in this rap game crack game sour  
And my path is crocked I suggest you don't follow it  
Pockets quite rollick and bullets quite hollow  
And ladies they really love a nigga's pipe game  
Givin' 'em slight pain for brain you might gain  
Above the weather no hail, sleet, rain  
I love the cheddar it aint nothing better man  
About 8 karats imbedded in the chain  
And another 8 invisible set in the ring  
Money aint a thing buy a plane then we fillin' 'em  
Ride in 2 Suburbans and a Hirsch cause we killin' 'em  

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams &amp; (Lord Tariq]  
Ty Water what's that sound (I wanna know)  
Richmond what's that sound (I need to know)  
Baltimore what's that sound (I got's to know man)  
Chi-Town what's that sound (come on tell me somethin' man)  
Detroit what is that sound (I wanna know man)  
Houston what is that sound (I need to know man)  
Little Rock what's that sound (I got's to know man)  
L.A. what is that sound (I need to know man)  

[Pharrell Williams]  
Oh you gangster now  
Word!  
You aint gangster nigga  

[Peter Gunz &amp; (Lord Tariq)]  
Its been a minute since we spitted 'em  
(Dogs we be killin' 'em)  
Niggas they be hatin' 'em  
(Broads they be feelin' 'em)  
Actin' like we reachin' man  
(Ay yo Gunz let me get at them)  
Look at how he buckle (when them things get to hittin 'em)  
Just another nigga with his face in the sand  
(I pull them things out and blam!) him and his man  
(I guarantee my guns wont jam) he should a ran  
(I'm crazy with a thing in my hand) you understand  
(Ay yo Gunz we aint havin' that) Lord I be grabbin' that  
(I run up in his crib tap the safe where he stash it at)  
Give me half of that I slap 20's on the Cadillac  
(Laughin' at chickens I'm only trickin' if I'm tappin' that)  
Ay yo I'm hittin' Hon's (sippin Henney)  
Got money (gettin' plenty what you thinkin')  
We brings (drama to whoever we can) squeeze things  
(From the street to the stage nigga) we sing  
(Bring the chorus in)
