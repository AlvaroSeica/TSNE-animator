[Intro: Obie]
Woo! I love seein you in the pictures, you know? (I pretend)
The pictures, you know? I'm good
(I pretend that you're already mine, already mine, already mine)
Let's go, woo! (I pretend)
O. Trice, let's go

[Chorus One]
I pretend (splash, splash.. splash)
I pretend (splash, splash.. splash)
I pretend that you're already mine, already mine, already mine
I pretend (splash, splash)

[Obie Trice]
I visualize, beatin it in the heat of the night
On the beach where the breeze just even the sight
You and me in the evening where the scenery's right
Ain't nobody intervenin, not a demon in sight (I pretend)
Just Obie - cheese and Missoni bikini
It got me fiendin to slide between them thighs at any moment
Swear she got me open, I'm just hopin Obie focused
Before I go overdosin on your love potion (I pretend)
Potent, put her in a poem
I'm seein her on the big screen, she got me gone
Deeper than a fan, more of a connection
I ain't never met her but I'm more than prepped and (I pretend)
I just wanna take her on a getaway, met her with a négligée
Put her on a pedestal then take baby breath away
You don't need a bullet - I know these dudes is full of it
Pullin shit cause you on the tube (I pretend)
And I know you're thinkin all of us rappers is bad news
Bad attitudes, bad press for you (I pretend)
So I'ma undress you with my mental, intimacy wit'chu
{Splash} Type of shit I'm into, WOO!

[Chorus Two]
I pretend that you're already mine, already mine, already mine
I pretend (splash, splash.. splash)
I pretend

[Obie Trice]
Yeah, you got 'em sprung
{?} long jeans, I wanna get it them
I wanna go down, work tongue
Show you how to cum 'til you say you're comfy with him (I pretend)
And I don't need premieres, I'm peace with the rear
Once she get free we skeet-skeet e'rywhere
Sayin O naughty in Bottega Veneta
I just wanna party, take that all feathered (I pretend)
Bounce outta Hollywood, you can roll shottie
No paparazzi followin them
Toss off the bra in the Grand Canyon
You could catch us in the cabin - guess who's stabbin? (I pretend)
Candid in the canopy, Cannes Fest', cancellin
She wanna stay next to handsome
He never had so he's the answer
Even though previous dates disaster (I pretend)
And I know you're thinkin all of us rappers is bad news
Bad attitudes, bad press for you (I pretend)
So I'ma undress you with my mental, intimacy wit'chu
{Splash} Type of shit I'm into

[Chorus Two]

[Obie Trice]
Why pretend? Let's binge off love-makin
Bend corner in Benz how a thug make it
It pans out if you loosen up
It's nothin wrong with lettin the director cut (I pretend)
His direction's nuts - trust
His election's you - us
That collection's few - thus
You're most beautiful, more of a reason to touch (I pretend)
And I know you're thinkin all of us rappers is bad news
Bad attitudes, bad press for you
So I'ma undress you with my mental, intimacy wit'chu
{Splash} Type of shit I'm into, yeah~!

[Chorus Three]
I pretend that you're already mine, already mine, already mine
I pretend
