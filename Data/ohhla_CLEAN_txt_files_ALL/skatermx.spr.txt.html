Chorus: Sporty Thievz

I want it, uh huh uh huh

"You ain't gettin nadda"

Aye Papi

[Sporty Thievz]
Yo I'ma a cheap cat, you peeps, I keep stacks
I don't care if you that, sweet rap, petite black
I'm tryin to shine yo, ?? stakes the dime yo ??
which means cheap, when you speak esponal
Come on, y'all know - if not, ask Mo'
Thinkin you gettin cash flow, then you'se a gassed hoe
I just let your ass go, you know, spend my dough
Get sheisty hoes that pose in centerfolds
Clothes, uh oh, now your man done bought Timb's
Make you Phillip Hartman, Spartan jonnin

[Mocha]
Uh yo, uh ballin, it don't cost in flossin
And the same to these cats, forget who's boss and
stallin, on low,  and I'ma leave ya crawlin
Mocha talkin all, off the wall and, what?

[Sporty]
What, all into my dough, involved in
Swim in my jacuz' then, like a dolphin
Well if I die, would you jump in my coffin?
Sell my law, then put all my cars in auction

Aiyyo, why I can't score without trickin no dough
Actin like I don't know how this trickin shit go
with these golddiggin, low-pro Moe squigglin hoes (chill!)
My Paul you right, I mean fuck for the amounts (now)

[Mocha]
Who dat dime honey who got her eyes buggy
My style lovely, but you won't get a dime from me
None of my money, you must be sick
I'm the one who tips and leave her some crisp
Bet I eat cake and known to peep snakes
by the Cheapskatez, looking for a cheap date
Thinkin he gon' feed me fries and cheesesteaks
You gon see me escape, check the release date

Chorus: Sporty Thievz

I want it, uh huh uh huh
Ain't got it, uh uh, uh uh
I want it, uh huh uh huh
Ain't got it, uh uh, uh uh

I want it, uh huh uh huh
Ain't got it, uh uh, uh uh
I want it, uh huh uh huh
"You ain't gettin nada.."

[Sporty Thievz]
It all starts in the club, with a sip of somethin
Now she wanna fill the glass to the tip or somethin
Then a nigga dead wrong when he flip or somethin
Like huh, you want what!  You better strip or somethin
Do it Player's Club style, work a hip or somethin
Get a ski mask, dump a clip in or somethin
Me, I'm more rich then poor, I just refuse to trick
Quick to holla (WHAT!) you ain't gettin nada damn dolla

KFC is good, but girls can't be chickens
Man listen, but what they can be is pigeons
Pigeons, the worst bird, that's my word
Eatin on curbs in herds lookin for herb
Chicks, they be frontin nice, but they whores really
Knew shorty was greedy when she pumped the 450
Mack on her titty like she fucked the whole city
Push an 850 and she leave ya cock spitty
I pulled up knockin Biggie, here kitty kitty (Who that?)
I'm lookin pretty jiggy, sweater all knitty (uh-huh)
What the deally?  She said, "You sound Willie"
Next Chilly, I said you sound silly

[Mocha]
You's a little nigga, found a real illy
Niggas like lead only fuck with big billies, you feel me?
Got a big house on the hilly, first style half a milli'
Take me shoppin, and illin
Drop-boxes, chef blowin up my lafa's
He threw all the pots, didn't even bill me the lobsters
Game tight, might throw you on my rocks y'all
but ain't gettin Cheapskate, nigga I got you

Chorus: Sporty Thievz

I want it, uh huh uh huh
Ain't got it, uh uh, uh uh
I want it, uh huh uh huh
Ain't got it, uh uh, uh uh

I want it, uh huh uh huh
Ain't got it, uh uh, uh uh
I want it, uh huh uh huh
"You ain't gettin nada.."
