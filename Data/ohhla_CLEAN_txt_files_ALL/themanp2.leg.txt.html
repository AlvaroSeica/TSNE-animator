Typed by: JoeMamma78@aol.com

[Chorus] {ALL 2X}
(The man who sold the world)
On stolen shores, we wrote these poems
Can't make it yours, any land on the earth

[Verse 1 - PSC]
It began with the man and it got complex
I guess Pampas promise, No honest-y among theives
When the land was free then a few individuals could breed
Succeed in division, driven by the vision on that land-mass
Never make the land last longer than the last laugh
God show (half-ass)
Real estate agents are really fake agents of Satan, quote that
Government's warpath, roll back borders
Remaining controllers of most of our oceans
How do we condone it?
Most of our oceans, they never should own it (we own it!)

[Verse 2 - Scarub]
Yo, Don't stop, get-it get-it
Money hungry while I'm in it
The world is mine and everything I find all up in it
Don't give a fuck who I've offended!
I'll take your life like I took this land and keep rollin man
Like an ice cream truck, I'm so cold wit' it
But try to plan it like Community-watch, or like a cop on your block
Got my hand in the oldest stocks, so when it snows I stay humble and high
All I know is the top
Yo, who are you to say what I ain't got? When I cop, all the whips
And got all the chicks, stay on my dick to play the skin flute
Like a didgeridoo, control the media too
Got my eyes on you
My bank money? I'll loan you
You work for me, shit I own you!
And mother is earth, our palms up her sizzer
Find her with her gems and suck the life out the dessert
Like a wizard (a wizard!), ??whats the final trick??
Super-rich once I sell this bitch
I need a remote control for my remote control
So when I leave this bitch I'm STILL in control

[Chorus 4X]

[Verse 3 - Asop]
Selling what you never owned; Land, water, sand
Put a price upon the beauty of our planet is ridiculous
But we on a metronome
a story telling fella dropping knowledge on the ego's of a species out of control
Cash hungry bastards, chopping down trees to produce paper money
Fiber from the earth backwards
Man's thought process: Anywhere I stand's for sale
The European, pale-faced world
Native Americans, stripped for the heritage
A people who understood the concept of earth
The one and only ever-life force can't be bought
So they give away, even by the ??? of the world


[Verse 4 - Sunspot Jonz]
Yea, Is your mind yours?
What defines war, then confines doors?
It's a sign OR you's a time-whore!
Meaning demons fiending, scheming
Propaganda build their own team when
Beef's in, and people letting time pass on by
And never last or try, that's why them cats so high
And now they're old-ass guys, when the life you live
Future's negative
Afraid to have some kids, 'cause every tax you get
Bust the guns, the runs, our son's will take to make capitalist cake
A bake, you in face
Care about the money they make
They sold the world for bookdeals, oil kickbacks
Steel exports, beef extracts
Back scenes lack, the true antidote
Boxed like the Pope, fearing light
Jail without soap on the rope, live without hope
So we live, give out dope to our own people cope
The pain to alert, to the fantasy
Never sell myself short!

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
