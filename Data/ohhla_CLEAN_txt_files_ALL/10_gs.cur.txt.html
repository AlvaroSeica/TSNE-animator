Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
I can take 10 G's, and make 20 more G's with that
I can take 10 G's, and make 20 more G's with that
I can take 10 G's, and make 20 more G's with that
I can take 10 G's, and make 20 more G's with that
I can take 10 G's, and make 20 more G's with that
I can take 10 G's, and make 20 more G's with that
I can take 10 G's, and make 20 more G's with that
I can take 10 G's, and make 20 more G's with that

[Verse 1]
Yeah I'm back in this bitch
Though I never left
I just took a lil time, [?] trees by myself
Now I'm way up high, everything top shelf
[?] last night totes to good health
We was fly last night if I do say so myself
Had all eyes last night, them hoes ain't wanna miss the jet
Million dollars worth of Chevys yeah bitches da [?]
[?] So I won't do it yet
Y'all can play for a couple of weeks
And I be back to destroy all the streets
The homie Cardo keep sending me beats, and I smoke em'
They think I'm selling drugs, nah bitch I'm just a dopeman
I woke up and I float from New Orleans to Oakland
The bro Sell Ski left the green door open
I'm in a Nova, that 383 strokin'
Gas or that cash flow, that's what keep it goin'

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Now I turn the corners, yo bitch watching my car
Got that weed burning, she wish she could hit the rock
Now she's lurking, cause she like what she saw
On Twitter and Instagram, searching the bar
Till by chance we meet again, don't be sleepin' in
On the outside, peeking in
On ya tiptoes tryna see over our fence ho
It's quite simple, see you was fishing for cents
We not them though, focus up, This game soak it up
She can't handle it, it's choking her, Whoa
Open that door before she barf on my Monte Carlo floor
Sorry, no, we can't kick it no mo'
Must go, back to the Gold rush, rush
Bust through, knock down all those who would oppose
Us getting dough, yo, Let's all be millionaires

[Chorus]</pre>
