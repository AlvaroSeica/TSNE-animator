[Chorus: Apocalipps]
Dear God, I wonder can you save me
I can't die, the devil trynna drive me crazy
Dear God, I wonder can you save me
Lucifer on my soul, this nigga's crazy

[Truck]
I'm finally here, I know ya'll been waiting
I'mma put you on the story about this nigga named Satan
His first name Lucifer, a Ruthless fuck
He'll take a lost soul man, boost it up
How a little muthafucka make 'em shoot shit up
Bet you read the end of the bible, this verse was written
All this kid ever needed, was a little attention
He was God favorite angel, the top of the list
Where did things go wrong, how did it end like this
Planes crashing, buildings falling, Apocalypse Now man
The devil's calling, hell is hot, the hottest temperature boiling
Heaven or hell, but which world we lost in
For every baby born, there's a dead man walking
Jealousy, murder, rape, drugs and extortion
Churches burning down, women having abortions
They say God can save us, so what is he doing
Cuz it gets evil, and we the one's losing
I ain't here to gas you up, and preach you bout evil
I'm here to spread the word and bring the truth to my people
We don't care if we kill each other, and keep getting locked up
Everytime I try to change, the devil pops up
Damien, leave me alone, these sick thoughts got me holding the chrome
Put money in dome, when I spaz out, and murder your unit
I stay in front of judge and say the devil made me do it </pre>
