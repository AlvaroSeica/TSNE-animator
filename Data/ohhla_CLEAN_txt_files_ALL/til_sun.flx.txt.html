[Intro: Funkmaster Flex] (Wale)
FUNK FLEX!!! (Bi-Billionaire)
WALE WHATTUP?!!! GRRRRRRRRR!!!!!
(A hustler's ambition, you must know one, plot on some more plots)

[Chorus: Wale]
We 'gon hustle 'til the sun up lord knows
I'm grindin all day and this is all I know
I'm about that life, I'm about that
You ain't 'bout that
Look! Under pressure you know a nigga won't fold
I'm grindin all day and this is all I know
I'm about that life, I'm about that
You ain't 'bout that, you ain't 'bout that life

[Verse One: Wale]
See I'm better than I ever been, so let's be clear
I see these square niggas ain't killin shit, they tell it different
I see no joy in, a drug game, where, most niggas get slained
Or, most niggas get snitched on by the same niggas they came with
At the same time I think of Trayvon
I'd done take two hits and pass and blow it out and pray hard
Where there is no middle classes either rich or you poor
We never had no upper hand that's why us niggas we are
Hold up! You ain't holdin down your kids then you ain't shit nigga!
Pardon me, you's a bitch nigga!
Then she's stealin all the dollars from your seed
Now by all means call it what you please talk to me huh!

[Chorus: Wale]
We 'gon hustle 'til the sun up lord knows
I'm grindin all day and this is all I know
I'm about that life, I'm about that
You ain't 'bout that
Look! Under pressure you know a nigga won't fold
I'm grindin all day and this is all I know
I'm about that life, I'm about that
You ain't 'bout that, you ain't 'bout that life

[Verse Two: Wale]
It's the product that'll get ya (YEAH!) slidin in that sixty (YEAH!)
True but I ain't through I'm on that grind for my position (YEAH!)
Tryin to keep my focus (YEAH!) Just tryin to see my vision (YEAH!)
Focus movin get with this key and tool is out that kitchen
Look! See bad on a sunday, see bad work of Gunplay
See 'round from a district where a nigga seen crack since a youngin (YEAH!)
And I ain't no killa I'm a fuckin gorilla
Keep my liquor cold please and rollin up the old dilla!!!!!
Quart a brick (Quart a brick) Half a brick (Half a brick)
You can sell it all can't touch me on that rapper shit (That rapper shit)
E'ry track I get (E'ry track I get) Make it my habitat (My habitat)
We smokin weed before you rap bitch I'll take laxatives I'M SHITTIN ON 'EM!!!!!!!!

[Chorus: Wale]
We 'gon hustle 'til the sun up lord knows
I'm grindin all day and this is all I know
I'm about that life, I'm about that
You ain't 'bout that
Look! Under pressure you know a nigga won't fold
I'm grindin all day and this is all I know
I'm about that life, I'm about that
You ain't 'bout that, you ain't 'bout that life

[Outro: Wale]
