[Intro: Ghostface Killah]
Word up, yo, I don't know, it's getting funky up in here

[Ghostface Killah]
Yo, I formed a crew, next day, tell me I'm slipping
I'm the boss of this fam, I need to watch my position
Bitches is sneaky, triflin' and not to be trusted
A weak link in the team, and the chain it get busted
Don't trust her, love is for suckers
Too many enemies is out there, son, trynna bring da ruckus
Keep a tight circle, don't let 'em rain on your parade
Keep doing what we doing, getting money and getting paid

[Chorus: William Hurt]
The enemies all around me, one mistake and they'll down me
They just wanna rain on my parade
I said the enemies all around you, one mistake and they'll down you
They just wanna rain on your parade

[Ghostface Killah]
I need shells, word...
It's mind-boggling, the heart wants it, the mind rejects it
Fuck the past, let's put the present, in perspective
That's my lady, she would never back stab or cross me
Stand butt-naked in the storm, sipping the frosty
You force me to choose? I'mma follow my heart
She was there from the beginning, but I tore 'em apart
No more DeLuca's, straight Killa Bee on The Swarm
And when it's time to get big, she put her game face on

[Chorus: William Hurt]
Enemies all around you, one mistake and they'll down you
They just wanna rain on our parade
I said the enemies all around you, one mistake and they'll down you
They just wanna rain on your parade</pre>
