[Hook]
Step in the dome Hialeah Homegrown
We be hittin crippie sippin the E&amp;J and zonin
We be trippin mixing the liquor
Different color tones
Hit the beach when we creep
Bitches know that its on
And we living youthful like the fountain in the middle
Chicos rap hopen they make scraps off the riddle
Sluts, skanks, and snitches some suckas they be skittles
And its funny even on sunny days it could drizzle

[Verse 1]
That shit aint crippie if it doesn't leave you walkin crippled
I've noticed niggas purchase ounces have they profits tripled
Don't think that serving green and makin cream is just that simple
I've seen niggas get split over skimpy nickels
Expecting dollar waterfalls but only get a trickle
You should holler to the rich livin out in brickell
Trying to launch your bizness just like a us missile
You might need people on high places when your in a pickle
What you think your product of narcotic being sold
Isn't really being traced cuz it got no barcode
The load been counted for way before it was dropped
From the yacht to the dock distributed on my block
Don't be stupid growing crip inside yo closet space
Electric sockets FPL yo they got you traced
I tell you info so you know but I aint sellin it
Although its easier to smuggle yae then my relative

[Hook]

If I'ma do it I'm a do it I aint livin to bluff
Getting mad because my high aint sufficient enough
Flip the crip in a dutch I'm wuick to say
Fuck the world
I don't believe in friends if shes fine I'm fuckin his girl
I've been living a whirlwind
Pray to god I'm around when the world ends
Cuz I live this life of hectic make my money from serving
Some malt liquor be my breakfast
Rollin with scandalous Cuban boys leave you breathless
Your fate depends what we price on the necklace
Try to flip the script on me you can't
Must respect the shit I spit you pank
Ass chico backwards
Think they makin a movement
I'm about to attack on these cowards
So the next time these suckas wanna know what I claim
I'll tell them simple and plain
I been raised in the H.I.A
