[Intro/Showbiz]
Yeah
This is why we got into this music shit
Because we love the art
This is what we do whether we get paid for it or not
But when you get to the business side of it, into the industry
shit just change man
Niggas fall apart
All that other shit
It becomes about money and all that bullshit
 
[Showbiz]
We make up to break up
Promises are broken
Friends turn to enemies
Feelings that we holding
The Fame make you feel 
You can do your own thing
Do the money take away the pain (huh)
Whatever the reason
We trippin cuz we different
When we started
The energy is missing
Damn, Fife and Tip called it quits
What is all of this
Gotta be more than hits
Thought RUN DMC would last forever
Similar to Salt n Pepper and the original Spindirella
Peter Rock and CL, Eric and Paris,
These ain't just rappers 
These are part of our fabric
Some say it's money, other say it's ego
Some grow apart look at Goodie Mob and Cee Low
Show and AG even when we we not performing
Make sure that's my nigga long after we recorded
 
[Interlude/Andre the Giant]
You motherfuckers come in the game
y'all niggas stay in the game
Y'all niggas keep it funky with each other
Niggas start getting all Hollywood and shit like that
Know what I mean
Becoming other niggas once you get a little fame and shit
Yo fuck that man
 
[Showbiz]
Even my bigger niggas took the brand for granted
We supposed to put the city on our shoulders like Manning
It happened with the Rock, P.E., Cam and them
Prince Marky Dee and them
Questions can't answer them
Not to mention John Lennon the Beatles 
Diana, Supremes, Mike left Tito 
When Cube left NWA it was questioned
 When Dre left NWA it was destined
Insane the fame is a roller coaster
Slick and Thug split after the show was over
Friendship gone businnes replaced
That's success that's the truth let's face it
I want succees the bond is so imporant
Can't pay with my friends a price I'm not afforded
Don't be sad it's over, be glad it once was
Signing off, Show and A nigga one love
 
[Andre the Giant]
Yeah man. See this is how it goes down
All y'all motherfuckers don't know about the game want to get in the game
y'all don't know shit about it
This shit tear motherfuckers apart
Fake nigga shit
Real nigga shit
DITC
Look out for the new DITC album coming
Look out for the new DITC album 2012
This is what we do
Ride out yo
