[Chorus: Timbo King]
If you got drug problems I feel bad for you son
I got '99 Hammers' and they all my guns, I hit you
I got '99 Hammers' and they all my guns, I hit you
If you got drug problems I feel bad for you son
I got '99 Hammers' and they all my guns, I hit you
'99 Hammers' and they all my guns
'99 Hammers'

[Timbo King]
The Mack I hold will clap your soul
The calico will put a big whole in your rose
Snub-nosed .38 could smell out my foes
We 'Kick in the Door' waving the .44
Rubber grip handle, handle this shit like a pro
Marksmen member us killer from the ____
Rifles with scopes on, we see y'all
This ain't Laser Park, it really Heaterz
AK .47's, you can't beat us
Ninety nine niggas with ninety .9's
Trigger happy and we yelling out VVI
Four pound in your grill 'bout to cook your beef
Heavenly armed, shots lift you off your feet
Hollow tipped dumb-dumbs will smarten you up
Go the pump in the trunk don't let me open it up
Want a war? We can shootout 'til the Po-Po come
Got '99 Hammers' and they all my guns

[Chorus]</pre>
