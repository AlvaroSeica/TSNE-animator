[*Pretty Willie talking*]
Yea!
I know y'all remember this one.
Y'all remember when this little piggy went to the market
Well check this out, this little piggy here, he make money
And he eat shrimp and steak, how you lovin' that shh.
Come on, come on

[Chorus: 2x]
This little piggy got money money
y'all little piggies got none
This little piggy eat shrimp and steak
while them other little piggies want some
This little piggy got money money
y'all little piggies got none
This little piggy eat shrimp and steak
while them other little piggies want some

[Verse] 
Straight out to pimp some real, dawg
Child, just go admit it
My style you love to hear it
My song you go and get it but
This little piggys on the market (market)
I'm tellin' y'all, y'all don't wanna mess with me
Cause I did went from way low, to way up, so what the 
I'm the same man, no matter what (ha)
But I hate to see them phonies but now they all up on me
For the hell we all are is lonely

[Chorus: 2x]

[Verse]
This little piggy, piggy
Can't mess with the style
Gotta give it all that I got
I'm that new cat, highly anticipated
But the rated didn't hate it, no time for fakin'
A dued album done and did it, St. Louis baby
Gucci, cars, rims, and clothes
Superbowls and gold, everybody gon' know
My city be stayin' real
You already know the deal
Most of my reallas chill
We prefer to keep it real, I'm the Will
So act like you know it, when you see me
Ridin' bumpin' my CD
Learnin' to love my city
We greedy indeedy, speedy to the scene of the drama
Makin' bustas pause like commas
Some kind'a  designers
See I'm gunna put it on my momma
Keep a pretty boy persona
Probably sell more records than Madona, but dawg
I hate to see them phonies but now they all up on me
For the hell we all are is lonely

[Chorus: 2x]

[Verse]
Straight out to pimp some real, dawg
Superbowls and gold
Everybody gon' know
Y'all don't wanna mess with me
I'm the Will

[Chorus: 4x]</pre>
