[Intro/Chorus 2X: Earl Sweatshirt]
All the bad bitches boo when you rap
I can teach you how to pull 'em like a tutor, in fact
I got one in the front and, two in the back
And the bitches keep screamin "Odd Future is back"

[Earl Sweatshirt]
Wolf with a T-Rex cock
Less talk while I invest stock in wet rock
Smoke with all the big bitches bumpin "Bedrock"
Sub in the trunk, thumpin up against the dead cops
And pop it like I tossed a match in the engine
And go harder than a fuckin crack intervention
Clown of the class and the last to attend it
Big Earl make you fags stand at attention
Odd Future, I'm your muh'fuckin general
Catch 'em where them slap, slash, stab bitch ass niggaz go
Girl, you ain't even gotta ask cause you fin' to know
Why this Playboy so sticky in this centerfold
Sticky what my niggaz blow, icky Earl finish foes
Hit 'em low, riddle them with +Chronicles of Riddick+ bows
Chronic in the spliff to the dome, got my system slow
so I'm walkin out, ask them niggaz what they sprintin fo'

[Chorus]

[Vince Staples]
Black Ted Bundy; sick as John Gacy
Chillin with a possible victim, she was eighteen
A hitchhiker hippie whore, met her at the liquor store
She frequented to help support the habit picked up in the 4th
Grade A piece of ass, so I plan on screwin it
Slipped of a couple Rufilin inside the bitch's juice and gin
Next thing you know, we're on Earl's burgundy carpet
and she's kickin and screamin, beggin for me to fuckin stop it
Look - you know it's not rape if you like it bitch
So sit down like a pretty hoe and don't fight the shit
or else I'll have to tie a pretty bow around your bloody neck
Hide the slices from the gashes given with a dull Gilette
Mop the blood up put the body in the apartment
Stash her where we hide the marijuana and the condoms
"Hey - what's that?" Don't touch it or even fuckin look!
You are Fantasia and the body bag's a fuckin book

[Chorus]

[Earl Sweatshirt]
Yo Vince, let me tell you 'bout these hoes I met last night
They thought I was cute 'til I asked what that ass like
Damn right, red light, ran right through it
"You don't even have your permit, what the fuck are you doin?"
Well maybe if you'd shut the fuck up, we'd be cruisin
and you wouldn't be sittin, boohooin 'bout your bruises
But no, you wanna be Miss Fuck-with-the-Music
I'm zonin on "Relapse," she's sliding on "Blueprint"
Three seconds it takes for her to turn blue
with my hands around her throat, her arms stopped movin
Pulse stops too, in the back, look confused
As I turn to tell them both not to do shit stupid
Red white, blue lights in the rearview shit
Swerved to the shoulder, tell 'em both no movin
Sit down in the back, cause the windows tinted
As I rolled down mine to forge a new friendship
"Aren't you a little too young to be driving?"
Look Officer, I'm just tryin to get home
"Get out the fuckin car with your license and registration"
I ain't getting outta shit and you startin to try my patience
Didn't have backup, I could tell by the Hummingbike
Reached to the glove, grabbed the motherfuckin huntin knife
Stabbed him in his neck and hip, threw him in the trunk and dipped
back to the fuckin crib for some tea and crumpets, shit

All the bad bitches boo when you rap
I can teach you how to pull 'em like a tutor, in fact
A dead one in the front, dead cop in the back
And two live bitches screamin "Odd Future is back"</pre>
