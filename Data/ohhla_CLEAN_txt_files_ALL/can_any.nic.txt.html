[Intro with interpolation The Williams Brothers]
(PAY ATTENTION!)
{"If you move, I'll fall"} D Bond on the beat
{"I'm leanin on you, you baby, you baby"}
Yo, yo (*TRAPAHOLICS*)

[Nicki Minaj]
I push, p-p-push it, I push it like I'm in labor
And he'll t-t-teach me to, teach me to love my neighbor
Just w-w-wait up, I'm processin all the data
Processin all the data, p-p-processin all the haters
You was writin disses, I was takin pictures
Signin autographs for all of my bad bitches
And in the nick of time it just dawned on
I am Nicki Minaj, and it's all on me
But hey, maybe I'll never win, maybe I'm settlin
Can't let the devil in I'm a comic book heroine
But when the wind blows, I'm so Marilyn
I'm so Marilyn {*echoes*}
Write it down take a picture, bitches e-mail that
I came to save a thing called female rap
.. But I hope my ninja powers
don't fuck around and offend you cowards
You mad at me cause you think I got it easy
If we was in the second grade then you would tease me
You see you still a lil snotty nose hoodrat
I love Nicki scribbled all over your book bag
.. I love you too
I just wish your mother would've hugged you too
.. You know Nicki luh da kids
Yellow brick road lookin for The Wiz
But when it rains, it pours for real
Def Jam said I'm no Lauryn Hill
Can't rap and sing on the same CD
The public won't get it, they got ADD
See Nicki, follow the rules
Always say your prayers, and get ready for school
Yeah follow the rules
Let me say my prayers and get ready for school
Dear God, I am only what you made me
And I appreciate everything that you gave me
But like, I don't wanna do it no more
Sort of lost sight of what I'm doin it for
Thought that I was doin somethin good for the game
Until they all started throwin dirt on my name
Tell Debbie, I really really tried
that I said I'm sorry, but I had to say goodbye
Tell Fendi, I'll never forget him
And please tell Wayne, I'll always be indebted
I'll never forget it
Please tell Wayne, I'll always be indebted

[Outro: repeat 4X]
AYYYY!
Can anybody hear me?
