[Intro: La the Darkman]
Yeah... It's that nigga La...

[La the Darkman]
I dump bodies in the river, alcohol got my liver
Never argue with no nigga, Escalade platinum silver
I'm a killa cuz I'm realer, rapper slash drug dealer
Cap pealer, born ill but the game made me iller
Got a spot in my hood you can cop from, for reals
Sellin' niggaz coke and pills like McDonald's Value Meals
And I still ship packs to jails in baloons
Baggin' up, sometimes I get high just from the fumes
Sweep a nigga like a broom with the M-1-6
This Brooklyn/Vietnam, we don't raise no bitch
Crown Heights, all night and all day them things bust
For that green inked paper readin' "In God We Trust"
It ain't all about the money son, it's all about the rules
And the more I follow 'em, my finances improve
Drugs stay in demand like Saudi barrels of crude
So from crack to rap, I'ma be that dude
Cuz I eat a nigga food, then lick his whole plate
At hustlin' I'm good, at robberies I'm great
Ask niggaz from ya state, cuz I've probably been there
Yankee cap, valour sweats, Wu-Wear or RocaWear
I'm on my grizzly bear, fuckin' bitches from the rear
Runnin' in 'em hard like a car hit a deer
Measure coke all year, digital or triple beam
I do a lot of dirt buy my nails stay clean
I'm a Viking to my likin', countin' money is excitin'
Push weight through the state of Tennessee like a Titan
Get to know me, I ain't phony, bitches wanna ride my pony
All cuz they know I get cheese like macaroni
It's amazin' how I'm purple hazin', four-fifth blazin'
With real bloody horror stories like Wes Craven
Half Jamaican so I'm used to takin', bitch nigga rapin'
Pie bacon, I'm trill while these other niggaz fakin'
It's La...

[Outro: La the Darkman]
Yeah... this the Sing Sing Regime, nigga
Go against that...
You gon' be a motherfuckin' corpse... nigga!
Yeah...
Embassy Entertainment's the label, motherfuckers!
Nah I mean? S.S.R.
It's how it's goin' down, nigga!
{*automatic gun fire*}
Yeah... yeah...</pre>
