Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro]
Uh, I can't go like that
No, uh, ah, uh, no, I can't go like that
No, can't go like that
Uh, brr-ah, no, I can't go like that
Gotta couple thou then I get a couple shooters
fo that couple thou man my niggas a shoot ya
nigga like me I can't go like that
thousand dolla shoes that I put on my feets
these niggas bitches they ain't really from the streets
these bitches love money an you niggas real cheap
nigga like me I can't go like that

[Verse 1]
Everyday not everyday my lil niggas a rob ya
playing both sides an you get hit with that choppa
all these niggas claiming that they really in the field
Where I'm from in the field you get killed
Put 10 on a lawyer on a 1st Ima make that money back on a verse
Bitches last money 2nd family 1st (OTF)
act a ass in that Jag I'm the worst
An I'm like Tony in my city put drug money way
before these bitches same niggas cookin chickens turns into pigeon
with me an you I can tell you all the difference

[Chorus]
I can't go like that gotta couple thou then I get a couple shooters
fo that couple thou man my niggas a shoot ya
nigga like me I can't go like that
thousand dolla shoes that I put on my feets
these niggas bitches they ain't really from the streets
these bitches love money an you niggas real cheap
nigga like me I can't go like that

[Verse 2]
If I wife a bitch man she better be a rider
Cuz the feds watchin building cases got us tide up
for a couple bricks get you hit and get you tide up
Only the family in my eyes you can't divide us (OTF)
got some old heads tellin me right
(Let's get it) you say I'm snitchin
you just gambling with yo life
No baseball my hittas gon strike the D line
open all night (turn up) friends ion do that shit
if I fuck her my squad they gon own that bitch
I'm gettin money that mean my niggas rich
still on the block that mean I'm nigga rich

[Outro]
I can't go like that gotta couple thou then I get a couple shooters
fo that couple thou man my niggas a shoot ya
nigga like me I can't go like that
thousand dolla shoes that I put on my feets
these niggas bitches they ain't really from the streets
these bitches love money an you niggas real cheap
nigga like me I can't go like that</pre>
