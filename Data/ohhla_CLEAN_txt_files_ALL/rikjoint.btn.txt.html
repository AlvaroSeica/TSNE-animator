  "And yes y'all...the sounds that you hear are def to your ear"

	It's like that y'all, it's like that y'all
	It's like that-that-that, like that y'all (Repeat 2x)

[Fashion]
Yeah them niggas be flipping that old ill
Just makes me feel with the skill sort of flow with the real
Will you pass it? Yep, I won't drop it
I could rock it, I got soul in my pocket, don't lock it
Just let me in to fill up the mem-brane
Donkeys over there, yep I'm so glad them came
Come, hey do you wanna cum? Well come and get some
I get you drunk like bum, hum
The Kool, so baby let me funk you down
Put cracks in your back with this Beatnuts sound
Junkyard with the flip, back with the title
So slow be the flow and it go with my recital
My idol, my tougne be fucking double-time kicking
Lyrics are so slick that the words be just like Rico-
cheting (bing) Shit too real, know what I'm saying?
The fucking beat might drop, but my rhymes just keep on playing
Playing, I guess I'm just too bad, hey, like if I had a twin
Kool F-A-S-H-I-O to the N
And that's how we do it, and that's how it go
World Famous in the house so just act like you know, aiight?

	It's like that y'all, it's like that y'all
	It's like that-that-that, like that y'all (Repeat 2x)

[JuJu]
It's the real beat digger, how you figure
I would ever take my finger off the trigger for some crab niggas
That the way I live that's how I'm saying
And yo people need to mind they biz and stop playing
I get lifted though I'm not a drug abuser
I got more heart than 20 niggas in a Land Cruiser
Plus I got more loops than hula hoops
Beats that make you go buckwild like Palestinian troops
It's the funk, can you feel it?
I live for the funk and I die to reveal it
I keep a reel so you know the groove is major
The kicks make you vibrate like if you was a pager
I know some niggas didn't think that we could do this
Lay some old ill shit down with the smoothness
So come on and feel the groove if you're with it
We hope that you dug it, cause that's why we did it

	It's like that y'all, it's like that y'all
	It's like that-that-that, like that y'all (Repeat 2x)
