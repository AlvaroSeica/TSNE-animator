Mama, won't you please let me
Mama, won't you please let me
Mama, won't you please let me
Mama, won't you please let me

Yo, coming in the sound fresher than cut grass
(Fun starts)
Second that we enter if you must ask (rush past)
Like you've forgotten your mind
Or the drivers all up in your face like can I see your
Bus pass!?
Huh naa
We just wanna lickle rhyme bruv
Call me what you want you want but you should not call it
A night love
And I might just join the mile high club
Only problem being that I couldn't give a flying fuck

Yeah lemme touch back down
Slap her bum until it
Comes back round
Half the rooms like OI what's this all about, with
The other half jiving like
I love that sound

A yeah yeah, I love that sound
A yeah yeah I love that sound
So flick your fag butts at once on a mad one like
Yeah, your mama can hump

Mama, do the hump, mama do the hump, hump
Mama, won't you please let me do the hump, hump
Mama, do the hump, mama do the hump, hump
Mama, won't you please let me do the hump, hump
Mama, do the hump, mama do the hump, hump
Mama, won't you please let me do the hump, hump
Mama, do the hump, mama do the hump, hump
Mama, won't you please let me do the hump, hump

Yo, it's been a long week
How I've got this much energy is beyond me
I just want all of these girls to be on me
And maybe even one of these could be Beyonce
We ain't gonna pack that rap noise in
All of that cheesy stuff, clap, clap sing
And we're gonna burn some calories right here, right now
Ain't over till a fat boy slims, mama

Mama, do the hump, mama do the hump, hump
Mama, won't you please let me do the hump, hump
Mama, do the hump, mama do the hump, hump
Mama, won't you please let me do the hump, hump

(Yeah, knock a rum back down)
Bust a little jiggy as the
Drum track pounds.
Half the room are just making their own crowd with
The other half jiving
I love that sound. A yeah yeah
I love that sound, a yeah yeah
I love that sound
So flick your fag butts at once on a mad one like
Yeah, your mama can hump

Mama, do the hump, mama do the hump, hump
Mama, won't you please let me do the hump, hump
Mama, do the hump, mama do the hump, hump
Mama, won't you please let me do the hump, hump
(Yeah)
Mama, do the hump, mama do the hump, hump
Mama, won't you please let me do the hump, hump
Mama, do the hump, mama do the hump, hump
Mama, won't you please let me do the hump, hump

When we step into the room everybody makes a pathway
Cause you know RK make the dance change
And we rule that crowd
And we don't change pace at the half way
We we, we keep it moving
We we, we hold it down
Can't stop
Break sweat
No loosing
Yes
Nobody gonna take my crown
Hold back
Na na na na never gonna happen
Go back
Na na na na never gonna happen
Especially when it's all packed out
Crowd shouting out
Yeah, I love that sound
Ah, yeah, yeah, I love that sound
Ah, yeah, yeah, I love that sound
So flick your fag butts at once on a mad one like
Yeah, your mama can hump

Mama, do the hump, mama do the hump, hump
Mama, won't you please let me do the hump, hump
Mama, do the hump, mama do the hump, hump
Mama, won't you please let me do the hump, hump
Mama, do the hump, mama do the hump, hump
Mama, won't you please let me do the hump, hump
Mama, do the hump, mama do the hump, hump
Mama, won't you please let me do the hump, hump
