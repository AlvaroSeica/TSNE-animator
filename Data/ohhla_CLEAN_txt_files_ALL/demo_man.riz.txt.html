I'm the demolition man and this is my demo so listen man...

Yeah are you listenin'?
Rizzle kicks, killin' this in abit
Silly ears didn't think we'd bring it big
But we kinda did, let me find a brick
Lay that down, down to the ground
Now it's about time you found out there's a sound
Lurkin' inbetween the buildings, certainly discrete
But still we push to be heard,
Shouldn't be detoured
By the fact that people couldn't give a blur
Yeah with hammers and tools, we plan to rule the slander
Shake my hand yo

I'm the demolition man and the is my demo so listen man
I'm the demo, demo, demo, demo, I'm, I'm, I'm the demolition man
I'm the demo, demo, demo, demo, I'm, I'm, I'm the demolition man
Ay yo, born derelish
Your nemesis,
My style has more decadence
Raw elegance, street fire
I am the 4th element
More adequate,
Let me please your mind your therapist
Torn ever since she left me
Let's get some more Stella's in
Born and a kiss no grammar sniff, I'm Luke your Anakin
More panicking rappers are advancing more vanishing.

I'm the demolition man, can you please give me a reason to show my expertise
I'm the de, I'm, I'm, I'm the de, I'm the I'm the demolition man
I'm the de, I'm, I'm, I'm the de, I'm the I'm the demolition man
I'm the demo, demo, demo, demo, I'm, I'm, I'm the demolition man

It's easy to build up and block it all out, but it's so much easier knocking it down
B, b, break...
I'm the demolition man and this is my demo so listen man
It's easy to build up and block it all out, but it's so much easier knocking it down
I'm the de, I'm I'm I'm the de, I'm the I'm the demolition man
I'm the de, I'm I'm I'm the de, I'm the I'm the demolition man
I'm the demo demo demo demo I'm I'm I'm the demolition man</pre>
