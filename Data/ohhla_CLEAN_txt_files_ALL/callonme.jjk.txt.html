Yeah, yeah, yeah, huh, huh, huh
Cmon, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Sing it for me (Uh-hu, uh-hu)
Yeah, OH, yeah (uh-hu, uh-hu, uh-hu)
Everybody come on (Uh-hu, uh-hu)
Yeah, yeah, yah {Yall know what this is}
Let's go

I don't know, if I ever felt like this before
But I'm sure, that the way I feel I don't want it to go
Cause I cried my share of tears
And I sang my share of blues
But to keep you over here, I'll do what I got to do
So baby

1-      [Janet](Nelly)
Call on me, whether day or night
I'll never leave
(See you don't have to be alone)
(I'll come anywhere you want)
(Baby just pick up the phone and call on me)
You ain't know, I wanna be homie, love girl
(See there it go, see there it go mama)

[Nelly]
See I, I never met a girl that could break me down
It's like I get caught in the middle
I get caught up a little anytime she's around
I be posted waitin on stand-by
Lookin' to catch a hint and I
Doin whatever whenever never forget I
Said I'd be here when you want to
Get what you need if you
Wanna recieve oh please believe you could

Repeat 1

[Janet]
Call on me, when you need someone who cares
Say the words and I'll be there
I can meet you anywhere
Call on me, anytime that you please
Babe whatever you want, babe whatever you need
Because you're the one I love baby just

Repeat 1

[Nelly]
It don't matter where you go
I'll come anywhere you want me to

[Janet]
It don't matter near or far
It's like anything you say I'll do
And it don't matter where you go
I'll come anywhere you want me to
And it don't matter near or far
It's like anything you say I'll do</pre>
