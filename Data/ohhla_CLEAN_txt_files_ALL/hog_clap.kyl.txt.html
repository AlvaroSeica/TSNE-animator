(*talking*)
Hey man, I'ma show you this new shit
That I got cracking for all them G niggaz mayn
Ery'body know about this shit
It's simple shit to do, but I'ma just really
Show you how to do it (get busy y'all)

[Hook]
Don't start no shit, it won't be no shit - 2x
You hear that Hogg clap (*cock, gun shot*) - 2x

[Kyleon]
I got a K with me, pump and a fo' pound
A six shoot a shotty twice, now I got fo' rounds
Better ask bout me G, it go down
I pull it, cock it, aim it, bust it smoke ya like a dro pound
I stay strapped, like a pair of mits
It ain't no playing games with me, go find you a pair of kids
Cause I got bullets that'll snap you, like a Cherokee
I'm not a horror flick bitch, but y'all better be scared of me
Cause I'll leave ya liver fried, motherfucker
Not Pac, but I'll send you to Riverside motherfucker
Leave you niggaz dead, river side motherfucker
He said he was a gangsta, that nigga lied motherfucker
Not Sean Paul, but I'll give you the light
And if I run out of bullets, I'll give you the knife
And if that don't work, I'll give you the right
But I don't want no money, just give me your life

[Hook - 2x]

[Kyleon]
When you see the Baretta buck, y'all better dodge
Or start getting yourself, like y'all Cheddar Bob
And if a bitch get in my shit, the broad better slob
And start eating my meat, like corn on the cob
Day 1 Familia, I'm sworn to the squad
I'm a motherfucking gangsta, sworn to the job
And like a gold digging bitch, I'm all about a dolla
Play with my do', I'm pumping blood all up out your collar
Got a special delivery, that's a retarded flow
And if you don't understand it, go back and record it slow
Kyleon's the hardest hoe, you just number two
Cause I be shittin on these niggaz, like I'm doin the number 2
I got more spit than kids, on a short bus
Y'all ain't harder than me, y'all just talk tough
Ask around, ain't no mo' like me
Even the Mississippi River, can't flow like me

[Hook - 2x]</pre>
