[Chorus: Sample] 
Dance for me, someone said 
Emily, shakes their head 
Slowly, gracefully
Emily begins 
 
[Verse 1: Deacon] 
She was a late bloomer, from Penny to Janet in a blink 
Dreamt bout being Josephine Baker in the mink 
Gold make-up in the Sphinx, skin made to view 
Body ornament performances, sin-sational 
From Rhythm Nation to, titillation through 
Demon-strations of, what she's made to do 
She always told me that she wanted to dance 
The only time she felt worthy of romance, damn 
I tried to told her she was worthy of chance 
But it's hard to talk to somebody in a trance 
I just gave her a glance, enough to sang her blues 
Be Pablo to paint her moves, be Langston to name her Hughes 
"Emily dance for me" someone said, she, curtsied and turned her head 
She posed, with knowledge and grace she gave us a taste 
With a look on her face that could be taken for dead 
 
[Chorus] 
 
[Verse 2: Natti] 
Are we crazy, deranged, to stand up for some change? 
Dreams turn to schemes, which marionette pulls your strings? 
Emily's enemy was Emily, feelin me? 
She only lusted the heel-toe kick to the symphony 
And now she justified cryin rivers for sympathy 
Which in end she finds out is simply misery 
No mystery, or OnStar on destiny's roads 
Ballerina wardrobe glowing under the strobe 
Twirlin amongst dollars, waiting under the pole 
For a slightly possible goal, sometimes we sell out our soul 
Can't help that, errrbody done felt that 
Just ask your favourite artists whose heart has turned to pitch black 
Ask some of these stars where they lost they sense of self at 
Strictly being puppets in public is a setback 
Yeah fam, that's Emily's energy 
Everybody's a dancer, I don't view you no differently, so dance
