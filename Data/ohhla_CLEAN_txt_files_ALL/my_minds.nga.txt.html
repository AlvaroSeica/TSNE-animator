Ain't that Shelly?
Wassup girl?
Awww you trippin'
You don't remember a nigga?
Well this will refresh your memory

Remember when you were bulimic?
Remember when you started getting fat?
Remember when you had to watch your weight?
I do, that was around the time you started watching Oprah Winfrey
That was about the time I started drinking brews and Hennessey
Alchoholism is a disease, hey I'm just a drunk
Remember your nigga before me, a straight punk
Living life like a monk and
Life has it way of balancing your checkbook
In order for you to get the neuro-psychiatric institute
That's where we met, psych ward, group therapy
Start by stating your name and why you're here
Ha, "NGA Fish Filet and I'm just too high on life"
That was the first time we actually got a smile, considered progress
I suggested you and I do some one on one
I slowed up on drinking, you slowed down on thinking sad
Thinking of all the fun we had, around this time
Things were getting better, no doubt
There was even talk of us both getting out
Sometime I can't remember around my birthday now
This is what happened, you were able to leave
The doctor said he was truly intrigued
With my ability to get you on your road to recovery
Then asked me to stay nicely, I told him to go to hell twice
With a left fin then backed him up with a right and told him "Good night"
Now a year, two days, and fifty electric shock treatments later
And all of a sudden now I've been wondering
Can you tell by the birdie that's chirping over which cuckoo this nigga flew
And can you love a dub of the remix of "My Mind's On U"

Life is so damn crazy
You can actually lose your mind breaking your spine for the wrong lady
And sometimes I amaze me thinking of all the styles that I come up with
When my mind's on you

Yoo-hoo! The Missus...Me with that...uh oh that
Yoo-hoo! The Missus...Me with that...uh oh that
Yoo-hoo! The Missus...Me with that...uh oh that
All of the styles that I come up with when my mind's on you

Haven't been able to get a wink of sleep
Aside from fact of going narcoleptic on any weak emcee when they begin to
speak
Peep, thought I saw you in the mall last week
Freakaphobic meaning I'm scared as shit
So I just decided to give you a call
Doo-doo-doo-doo!  The number you have reached is not in service
If you feel...I done wrote letter after letter got no reply
Maybe I'll just drive on by
Hello? Shelly? No? Got the wrong door? Okay
Now going to plan S-E-A, why
It just so happens that I bump into your mommy around Third Street
Damn near knock her off her clumsy feet
"Hey Fish, how you doing?  Where you been?"
"Psychotherapy over again
 but my psychologist says things are looking up
 For me in 2003 well that's when I'll be totally rehabilitated
 Dealing with all these phobias
 Claustro-, miso-, negro-
 Hey the only thing I ain't scared of is them wack emcees and water
 And...how is your daughter?"
"Oh she's fine, I know you know she stays with Aquanetta on Normandy and 43rd
 You should go and see her"
I said, "Word"
This is when I got into your mind, travel down your spine
Seek and you shall find but you gotta know what you're looking for (I do)
I'm the type of nigga that's a jack in the box under a king box spring
Am I not, the way I just hop up out of the blue
A year ago I might woulda suggested we both go back
To the C.V. Shack and get into a real project blowed
But no, I ain't living low
Well, I still live below sea level 
But I don't think that has anything to do with my state of mind
I slowed down on trying to get every Shelly under my sheet
And I've rolled too too many windows down down
Trying to be the freak of the week finder
Now what does that have to do with the T and Tray Loc?
Nothing at all, my niggas still tossing 'em up
But you know they say, birds of a feather flock together
Well enough about the birds and the bees
Can you love a dub of the remix of "My Mind's On U"

Life is so damn crazy
You can actually lose your mind breaking your spine for the wrong lady
And sometimes I amaze me thinking of all the styles that I come up with
When my mind's on you

Yoo-hoo! The Missus...Me with that...uh oh that
Yoo-hoo! The Missus...Me with that...uh oh that
Yoo-hoo! The Missus...Me with that...uh oh that
All of the styles that I come up with when my mind's on you

Yoo-hoo! The Missus...Me with that...uh oh that
Yoo-hoo! The Missus...Me with that...uh oh that
Yoo-hoo! The Missus...Me with that...uh oh that
All of the styles that I come up with when my mind's on you

Yoo-hoo! The Missus...Me with that...uh oh that
Yoo-hoo! The Missus...Me with that...uh oh that
Yoo-hoo! The Missus...Me with that...uh oh that</pre>
