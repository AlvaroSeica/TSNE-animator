Chorus: Noreaga (repeat 4X)

To all the bitches out there, you know I'm talkin to you
(We wanna fuck you Nore!) I wanna fuck you too

[Noreaga]
I'm in Philly with, Chilly in the after party
Gettin head in the bathroom, with Bacardi
My niggaz rowdy in the party like a hundred deep
I don't come alone, nigga bring the whole street
Ladies love me now, and now they wanna creep
Leave they man and all, I ain't mad at all
I got money now, when I'm down South I ball
I met this chick in the Rich, she was black and tall
She had, nasitall, no-ass-at-all
Told the bitch watch out, move back and forth
My niggaz come through, watch my niggaz, crack the car
Motherfuckers ain't live though, shop in the mall
Uh-huh, shit shit, let me kick my shit
Bring the biscuit, to the district, and miss it
Motherfuckers like Jake watch them try to frisk it

Chorus: Scarlett (repeat 4X)

To all the niggaz out there, you know I'm talkin to you
(We wanna fuck you Scarlett!) I wanna fuck you too

[Scarlett]
How many pretty bitches you know, could flow like me?
Flip bricks and get dough like me?  I'm Scarlett
When I ride you, who could make you cum like me?
Motherfucker you know ain't nobody else like me
I'm one of a kind, thuggin it, and I'm a dime
You lovin it, want some head nigga?  None of the time
That dick ain't mine, nigga you, just a trick
So what I look like?  Givin you this bomb shit
I be like sick, when a nigga bust too quick
and rush to get they nut off, before I get to bust off
Then they get shut off, that be the shit that get a nigga cut off
I'm sorry, and I hate to mislead ya
But I gotta leave them, ninety-nine is here
And we gon' please ya, Scarlett and Duchess
Harlem World true divas, what?
(What?  Yo yo, yo yo yo yo yo, yo yo)

Chorus: Noreaga (repeat 4X)

To all the bitches out there, you know I'm talkin to you
(We wanna fuck you Nore!) I wanna fuck you too

[Noreaga]
Hey yo, thugged out, bounce, once you bounce in my house
Yo I couldn't sell weed cause I smoke like an ounce
Yo I smoke too much, my niggaz smoke too much
And it's fucked, cause all my niggaz cancer bound
And we smoke more weed when we out of town
Even smoke barnyard, and that homegrown shit
And we know we only pull the smoke, green that's it
Have my nigga Branson, just FedEx shit
When I'm, in L.A. or just, caught in the mix
And I do the same thing when I'm caught in Da Bricks
It's like Roger Rabbit, because y'all, full of Trix
Fuck y'all cats, because y'all cats, fuck like this
N-O-R-E, you know I make subliminal hits
Yo Queens nigga, cream team nigga
And I won't stop, til I'm makin six figure
And do whatever what, N-O-R, your nigga

Chorus: Noreaga (repeat 2X)

To all the bitches out there, you know I'm talkin to you
(We wanna fuck you Nore!) I wanna fuck you too

[Noreaga]
Too too too too too, too too (6X)</pre>
