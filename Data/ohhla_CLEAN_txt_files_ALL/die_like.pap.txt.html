[Intro]
They say you live by it die by it, the life of a G

[Chorus]
If my death, is anything like my life, then I'm a die like a G
Throw your hammers up in the sky just for me
I don't live in the Stuy the Stuy live in me
Nigga what! Hit you up with the mac
Nigga what! You ain't fuckin with Pap
Sendin shots at me I'm bustin 'em back
So I ride around the town with the gun in my lap

[Verse One]
Aiyyo my bond is my life, my word is my bond
You pull the two five, I'm a pull the fo' fo' long
Niggas can't stop my reign my bars too strong
I was here when you came, I'm here when you gone
Keep talkin like you tough when you singin your song
I'll blow your head off, make the morgue sew it back on
Niggas catch beef in the night, and slip in the dawn
That's why the most bodies get dropped in the early morn
When the body get scooped up, it's shipped to the morgue
The killer go to the crib and pillow talk to his girl
Baby moms said she gonna send him where he belong
Called the cops that's what happen when a woman is scorned
At the end of most arguments somebody get warm
Always gotta be right, just admit when you wrong
Say you 'gon ride through the hood and blow your chron
But you just ride through the hoof and blow your horn

[Chorus]
If my death, is anything like my life, then I'm a die like a G
Throw your hammers up in the sky just for me
I don't live in the Stuy the Stuy live in me
Nigga what! Hit you up with the mac
Nigga what! You ain't fuckin with Pap
Sendin shots at me I'm bustin 'em back
So I ride around the town with the gun in my lap

[Verse Two]
Feel like I'm Tarzan, awww man my girl Jane
My homies wild like the animals we all bang
Lookin for this coward 'cause he owe me some small change
Heard he in the gamblers spot
How you 'gon gamble while you owe me homey? I ran up in the card game
With that long thang, I put dots on they heads
While they playin poker, I ain't playin with y'all lames
Man I gave them niggas poker dots like Kwame
Sayin they killers, man when they 'gon start killin
When blood start spillin y'all start sayin y'all chillin
Let them out of town niggas catch y'all slippin
Put work on the blocks some food out of y'all kitchen
Flossed in your party, sexed all of y'all women
You runnin 'round talkin 'bout you ain't got no hard feelings
You ain't got no hard feelings 'cause you really a broad
This nigga soft I don't feel him if his feelings ain't hard

[Chorus]
If my death, is anything like my life, then I'm a die like a G
Throw your hammers up in the sky just for me
I don't live in the Stuy the Stuy live in me
Nigga what! Hit you up with the mac
Nigga what! You ain't fuckin with Pap
Sendin shots at me I'm bustin 'em back
So I ride around the town with the gun in my lap

[Verse Three]
Could snatch the sharks out the ocean, then watch you die
Take you guppies out the fish tank and let you dry
Kill you piranhas at a blink of an eye
But I ain't thinkin 'bout you I got some bigger fish to fry
'Cause when a nigga live a thug life 'til somebody hit 'em
The family always wanna blame the person who with 'em
So if you was with your homey and y'all got hit up
And he make it and you made it then you better grip up
Now it's more homicide, more bloodshed
'Cause all they really wanna know is, why you ain't dead?!
A nigga follow my whip I ain't 'gon scream and shout
I'm a lead him to his death, that's what I'm about
Call my homey on the cell, you chillin no doubt
These niggas followin the whip, they must think I'm a slouch
I'm a ride through the block, by the club house
When you see the car behind me, air that shit out

[Chorus]
If my death, is anything like my life, then I'm a die like a G
Throw your hammers up in the sky just for me
I don't live in the Stuy the Stuy live in me
Nigga what! Hit you up with the mac
Nigga what! You ain't fuckin with Pap
Sendin shots at me I'm bustin 'em back
So I ride around the town with the gun in my lap

[Outro]
Nigga what!
