[Intro: Dom Pachino]
Yeah, take a walk with me real quick, man
Show you where I come from, how I ride
Who I rock with, the Team, the camp, real shit
Real street shit, man, come on, yo

[Chorus: Dom Pachino]
Don't get it curled, my shit off the chain
I hear the shit that's out and that's the reason why I came
Dom P's the name, the game done changed
I did my research and these niggas all lame

[Dom Pachino]
Keep my hat low, take the game to another plateau
He's so militant, reggaetone rap flow
No one does it like this
I got diamonds on my neck-neck, diamonds on my wrist
Move so swift, shit, it gotta be a gift
Shit I must have, cuz my shit smoking like a spliff
Work the game like a 24 hour shift
Don't get it curled, don't get it twisted

[Chorus]

[Dom Pachino]
I told 'em, they could never fuck with the God
I told 'em, they should never fuck with my squad
I told 'em, that when I come, that many shall leave
Music come natural to me, lyrics fall out my sleeve
I throw darts at cha, that you niggas can't weave
I move too fast for ya, you not even my speed
I'm not, dealing with greed, I just want what I got coming
This is something I need
And don't get it curled, I'm not a Wu-Tang affiliate
I already showed how I'm different
My work ethic a different direction
How I drop LP's at my own discreation
They ain't no kung fu shit mixed up at my session
If you don't know by now, I'm gon' teach you a lesson
Damn, I'm so close to perfection
This is Napalm music, nigga, all in your section

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
