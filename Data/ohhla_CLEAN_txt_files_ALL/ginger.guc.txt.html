[Intro]
It's Mannie mane, and Juicy mane, and Gucci Mane {*echoes*}

[Gucci Mane]
I'ma keep droppin verses, hotter than the hottest summer
Eat rappers like Jeffrey Dahmer, dope color Sinead O'Connor
Should I name another woman, rushin like President Obama
Warner Bros., two extra commas, all my shoes are Ferragamo
Lightnin actually hear the thunder, even Stevie Wonder wonder
why yo' baby momma called so much I had to change my number
Sarcassm, these bitches need to ride on while I pass 'em
I wouldn't even give that bitch an orgasm
Miraculously, my niggaz stand beside and not in back of me
So disrespect my faculty, how dare you have audacity?
The club packed to capacity, I cash out automatically
I spit these rhymes so radically, sporadically, fatality

[Chorus]
I got the green, drank, pills, blow
Runnin 'round the town gettin money I suppose
I'm the gingerbread man {*4X*}
I got the green, drank, pills, blow
I cain't get enough sleep, cause fiends be knockin on my do'
I'm the gingerbread man {*4X*}

[OJ Da Juiceman]
Gingerbread Man, I got white, I got white
Trap house, money up all night, take flight
Droppin ten bases, it's jumpin that white
Trees to that paper so I'm something like a kite
Loud stanky kush, at the end it need a light
Extra loud diamonds and it's lookin like a light
Rollin stay in money and my pockets just glide
Arrogant-ass diamonds cause they don't like to hide
VVS like glass so you block your eyes
These burnt color diamonds like a sweet potato pie
This the color diamonds and they ratchet like a fire
The brick man, the bread man, I don't tell no lies

[Chorus]

[Gucci Mane]
I'm the man that get it in, I ain't only in it to win
I am constantly settin a trend, I get bored and do it again
If I was ever was to cross the genie, I'd ask her for a twin
Cause the number of times that'd pay for me to get up off my end
It's 15 minutes to 10, ay and I'm done drinkin gin
Have to act like we were friends, but I don't like to pretend
I got 30 stacks, meet Ajax, get your freezer price on my album acts
I'm addicted to ballin, I hit Lind's mall and relapse
Your slump-ass no bankroll, my stacks gettin way too fat
No push up, just cook up, I'm booked up, I don't run laps
It's Mannie mane, and Gucci Mane, and Gucci Mane hold bricks mane
Got chips all in my britches so my house smell like cocaine

[Chorus]</pre>
