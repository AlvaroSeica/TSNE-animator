[Intro &amp; Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
Yeah, shorty, let me hit you with no delayin watch me do it again
I know shorty was with it the way she threw at her friends
I turned around and then gave a pound to all of my men
And peeped my mami send this through watchin me with a grin
You know it's funny the way my shorty was playin kinda hard
The way she lookin mami itchin to give it good to the God
She hit me off in the crib and hit me off in the yard
Her mind right keepin it live of the half these other broads
I'm fuckin with ya

[Syleena Johnson]
I know that I made you wait (For a very long time)
Cause I wasn't ready baby (For you to come inside)
Wanted you to know my name (And not just what's between my thighs)
I wanted you to play the game (Because I knew you get the prize)
But the game is over baby (The more you need to fantasize)
Cause I'm not letting go (So come and put your lips on mine)
I won't even hesitate (Oh no baby not this time)
I'm gonna give you all my lovin (And I'll make up for lost time)

[Chorus: Syleena Johnson]

[Verse 2: Syleena Johnson]
Won't you come a little closer (While I slowly dim the lights)
Put your hands up on my body (Baby you can take your time)
Ain't no need to rush baby (Because we got all night)
I just wanna scream you name (And make you wanna scream mine)
I tried to fight the feelin baby (Boy you got me hypnotized)
But I cant help that I've been feenin lately
(I think about you all the time)
Tonight I'm gonna get aggressive baby (So don't you fear put up a fight)
Tonight I'm gonna put it on you baby (Sit back relax enjoy the ride)

[Chorus: Syleena Johnson]
It's the remix (Remix) dj's play it (Dj's play it)

Busta busta (Busta bust) and Syleena (And Syleena)

[Rampage]

Spread you on a futon like Grey Poupon
Eight inch nine inch maybe I'm too long

[Baby Sham]
Ok well just let me get my get right on
Watch shorty how she dip in her Vicky draws
Hot shorty when she strip and her lips is on
My neck my back and her grip is strong

[Spliff Star]
Actin naughty (Yeah come on) then my kicks is on
Me and shorty wylin out like dirty flicks is on
Late night Mister Cee mastermix is on
Holdin on the same table that the bricks was on

[Busta Rhymes]
Word is bond baby we can continue to get it on
The way we slap the skin we can make a beat to a song
Ald let me play the guitar with the string of your thong
The way you throwin it back knowin your dead wrong your dead wrong
