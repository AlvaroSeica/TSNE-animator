[K. Born]
Yo, motherfuckers is straight jealous
It's wild
We got one motherfucker talkin about another motherfucker
Motherfuckers is on that gay shit
Yo we keepin this uncut
Check, check (K. Born K. Born on that South Central shit)

I fell asleep and woke up, saw the drunk handcuffed
Your feuds, cut the fuck up, for what sweat, burnin like booze
Last thought, I was flashin my passport til a cop stopped me 
in front of the barbeque spot, in the black Porsche
Switch cars, just to be safe, in case I'm bein followed
from state to state I'm guaranteed to see tomorrow
Priceless, can't be borrowed, only for purchase
Too much can make you nervous, federal, been there
Before you done that, you seein Starr's like Fredro
Quick to comeback, I got you bobbin for dineros
and foreigners fancy that feature fetish, letters skanless
Fuck who the man is, poison infected infested the block
Got you naked, sweatin hot
This party is disconnected, shall I rock?
I elevate thought, to a new state and teleport through
Blowin your fuse, until you stiffen to statues

Chorus: repeat 2X

	Yo it's uncut, we keep it pure for your ear
	You get one time - to shine in this game
	Yo it's uncut, we keep it raw for your ear
	You get one time - to shine in this game

[K. Born]
I hang around dirty syringes, inches from bums on park benches
The stench is, hideous, the city is, off the hinges
Hesitate ?, no escape
Once you start you struggle but get, far from a taste
Put me in water, watch me bubble, bake me with soda
Watch me double, break me down you'll make a bundle
Fuck what your friends say, I got two diamonds bitches and clients
Star status, the baddest cars made from science
About face, no mistakes, playin for high stakes
The wild race, no breaks, I provide base
I birthed ballers, in every state, who only trust
they Rottweilers, I create shotcallers
Numb your whole tongue, from lickin my asshole, freeze
Left her froze, eleven blows to the nostrils
Deadliest threats, takin no bets, gamble your soul
Explode in your chest, drop to your toes, give up your flesh

Chorus</pre>
