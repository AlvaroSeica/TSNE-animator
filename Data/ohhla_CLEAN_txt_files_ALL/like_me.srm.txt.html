[Intro: Erick Sermon]
Erick Sermon! Too Short!

[Too Short]
What's up playa? We got the young homey from Decatur, Georgia

[Lloyd] (Too Short)
Hey!!! You never met a nigga like me
I don't think you never met a nigga like me (MOTHERFUCKER!)

[Verse One: Erick Sermon]
Yeah this is part two of this shit, I'm E Dub
And here the king of Oakland Short has spoken
Respect what your hearin like it's comin from Franklin
We in the start up lane the same as Banks and...
We got a couple of safes we hold our bank in
We get the women too what the hell y'all thinkin?!
Huh! Hey young girl!!!
Come chill with a couple of millionaires that house got many stairs
Beware I'm a vet yet
And I ain't talkin 'bout the car I'm a star that there you can bet
Ask my nigga Flex man (I'm vanglorious)
Nigga they call me X-Clan don't before sex man
I spend dough when I want and you save
I'm a pimp, it say that on my Banner ask Dave
My favorite color is blue, but I ain't crippin
I Like Too Short too, but I ain't trippin...Uh!

[Chorus: Erick Sermon] (Lloyd)
Walk in the V.I.P. eyes on me 'cause (You never met a nigga like me)
Uh! He's alright but he's not (I don't think you never met a nigga like me)
I got girls in every direction, perfection (You never met a nigga like me)
Get mad respect when I step on the set (I don't think you never met a nigga like me)
Movie!

[Verse Two: Lloyd]
In the, pink do' six fo' deluxe
Ride slow while the hydro dronin up
Gettin paged different dames ladi da what's up
So they tired of playin games and they tryin to fuck with you
Spittin game watch them open up 
And yes, I love sex, and just my luck
It's so many young niggas get more bucks than us
Like shorty fuck the price I like ice on my nuts

[Chorus: Erick Sermon] (Lloyd)
Walk in the V.I.P. eyes on me 'cause (You never met a nigga like me)
Uh! He's alright but he's not (I don't think you never met a nigga like me)
I got girls in every direction, perfection (You never met a nigga like me)
Get mad respect when I step on the set (I don't think you never met a nigga like me)
Movie!

[Verse Three: Too Short]
Me and Erick Sermon in the benz on the interstate
Wish this motherfucker had wings 'cause you in the way
The car pass we ain't signin autographs
Unless you got, every tape with every rhyme I ever rapped
We rollin nonstop to the A.T.L.
How we stayin on top you can't me tell
And no we don't claim to be the biggest stars
But when they see niggas cars.....bitches pause
Tryin to, find a way to be my friend
Climbin her vagina so deep I'm in
And all these mad rappers tryin to flag me down
I throw a peace sign about to tuen back around
But I keep flyin, lil' homey keep grindin
While you keep whinin, when you see me big timin
Can't keep it to myself man I had to tell
Your still rappin in my head I'm still mad as hell BEYOTCH!!!

[Chorus: Erick Sermon] (Lloyd)
Walk in the V.I.P. eyes on me 'cause (You never met a nigga like me)
Uh! He's alright but he's not (I don't think you never met a nigga like me)
I got girls in every direction, perfection (You never met a nigga like me)
Get mad respect when I step on the set (I don't think you never met a nigga like me)
Movie!

[Outro: Too Short]
