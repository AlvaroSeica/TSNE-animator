[King Lil G]
King lil g
Tattood gunz in the building
Aye they wanna know what that ak stands for
I say its freedom homie
I do whatever the fuck i want

[Chorus]
My whole squad stay sucio
And that sucio it mean dirty
3 oâclock i'm intoxicated
I'm switchin' lanes
I mean swerving
I put my number on instagram
And hoes get at me
Like i'm thirsty
They gave the homies 25 to life
And i'm talkin' bout the shits dirty
So dirty
So fucken dirty
That sucios click
They know its dirty
So fucken dirty
So fucken dirty
Yeah we dirty
My click is dirty
I do my enemies dirty
So fucken dirty
We fucken dirty

[Verse 1: King Lil G]
Don't know how to act
When i bump chalino
I drink buchanans with my click
I'm talkin' gangsta stilo
When i need that work
And i need them pistols
Then i call my primos
My soldier halo
Busted missions
Took them trips to reno
Hell yeah thats me
Hell yeah thats me
Me g the king
Make em all panic
When i pull out the heat
If a muthafucka foul
Don't let em speak
Put em on a t-shirt
R.i.p
When i hug your girl
I smell like weed
When your girl goes home
She smells like me
Hell yeah g the king
Tell your baby mamma
Go ahead, she need to unfollow me
Wanna come chill where the bottles be
Me &amp; 2 girls thats possibly
Sucios mob i wrote it
Homie the constitution
Fuck the d.e.a
Who got the capo prosecuted

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: King Lil G]
This whole click's gettin' tatted up
And i represent it to the maximum
We started off with a bag of drugs
Now with pretty women
Thats bad ass fuck
Back then we didn't have shit
Now we're doing our thing
I came up &amp; brought the homies with me
Like fuck it bring the whole team
I always wanted that private party
Now bring gerardo ortiz
Play my favorite songs
About drug dealers
And how they came from the streets
Sucio it means dirty
Sucio till i murder
I'm kidnapping these instrumentals
They lace em up then i merk em
I been ambitious
I stay consistent
Like i'm suppose to
Big homie told me
Don't act suspicious
They pulled us over
El pocho antrax
Rollin' up
In that range rover
Eating mariscos on sundays
Thats for that hangover

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Drumma Boy]
These bitches know that we dirty
Them phonies know that we dirty
My homie driving to mexico
And you know they moving them birdies
Make a call to my soldiers
They all roll up in a hurry
So all you phonies thats actin' up
I suggest you better be worried
The bitch i'm with she's dirty
She like to take it in the mouth
She walk around all flirty
You know what the fuck i'm talkin' bout
That a-k mob life
New j's coke white
New bitch just right
Ass shaped like a half pipe
2 words to my enemies
And that's on sight
Fuck around with your ex-bitch
I just might
Smoke a blunt to dome
Homie thats high life
Stay close to the chrome
Homie that's my life

[Chorus]</pre>
