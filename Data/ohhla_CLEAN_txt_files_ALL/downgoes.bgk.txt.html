[Dresta]
Bang bang bang
Pull the trang
As I shoot my shit
And I flaunt my gift
Leaving another stiff
It's me, the D
Yeah the Compton thug
I get down like mud
When i'm high of bud
Little Sally Walker
Jackin from a saucer
Sally wanted dick
So the gangstas quick to toss her
Niggas wasn't knowin Gangsta Dresta's kinda locco
Always out for mo' hoes
So put the lock on your hoes
When I come around
I get around like Tupac
But you jock
The same little hoes that the crew got
Didn't you get mad when you found out I dug her
Cos thats about the same time you realised you love her
Nigga, who the bitch
Is you the bitch
I guess if you knew the bitch
You know, how to do the bitch
Screw the bitch
And send the hooker on her way
Suckin like I did my bitch, Jesse Mayer
The Compton thug
Gettin love by many
But i'm hated by masses
So fuck they asses
Niggas say they men
And they large, but they so alone
Bitches got
Niggas puttin chrome to they dome
Goin out asshole motherfuckin backwards
To kill the frustration
Why don't you just blast her
But no, you'se a sucka
Stupid motherfucker
You'd rather let a bitch drive you dead to the gutter

[Chorus X4]
Down goes another nigga
Down goes another nigga
Down goes another sucka

[BG Knocc Out]
Niggas wanna fight me over they bitch
Not knowin the bitch is a trick and she be all up on my dick
But yet he still loves her
Kisses and he hugs her
Wantin to squab with your homie over a bitch
Now thats a busta
You better recognise and realise
The fuckin facts
This some shit kicked
Fools gonna watch ya back
Your homie or that bitch
Nah that bitch is gonna break
Leave your ass stranded for dead
Cos that bitch is just a snake
If I were you and that bitch tried to play me
I would just 'buck buck', rock-a-bye baby
Bury that bitch six feet in a ditch
For tryin to sucka me
Let her know that i'mma G
And i'm stayin sucka free

[Chorus X4]

[Dresta]
You better learn to be strong
Try to be a bigger figga
Instead of goin out
Damn, down goes another nigga
Catch yourself
And try to check yourself
And don't neglect yourself
Before you wreck yourself
Its gonna be a long day
You goin out the wrong way
You better pay attention
To the words that my song say
Don't be a sucka
Don't be a busta
Don't be a trick
Man, fuck that bitch
Fuck that bitch with the nine
If she blow your mind
Grab the AK-ray
If she wanna play games
Bitches try to date ya
Try to snake ya
Wanna take ya
Wanna try to rape ya
But its in they nature
Wake your ass up
Don't be a sucka all your life trick
Clear yourself of that bitch
She'll be upon the next dick
Killin yourself
Makes you nothin but a busta
Especially for a bitch
Damn, down goes another sucka

[Chorus X5]</pre>
