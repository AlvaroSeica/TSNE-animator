[Phillie]
Ain't nothing wrong with speaking your mind
But since I'm down with switching you know I'm on the grind
Flows good therapy, yeah people heard of me
Been hood celebrities since we were seventeen
Smoking better weed, there couldn't be a better team
For those whose saying 'Hip Hop Is Dead' not necessarily
Looking for better beats, something that will help your seed
Belly is full even getting better sleep
I got a swagger make it harder then menace
Try spitting hundred times faster, significant damage
Liquidate my assets, no rings and chains
Drop down on a mansion, Benz and Range
Gotta keep it business, these thieves relentless
The one our seeds to live in is greed or prison
So best believe my mission is cleaning the dishes
Make niggas wash their hands before coming to dinner
It's been a long time with it, glad Bronze did it
My Wu-Tang connect sharp as knifes with it
Father the game and we go back side with it
Leave my mark so that y'all know I did it
And quietly kept off then he's been slept on
I was just reborn in the form of my next song
Tough as Teflon, built for the best broads
And walk by in these streets it's best you kept on
Lil' piss head soldiers get mashed and stomped
Real niggas in rotation, pass the blunt
The Wisemen are ripening, P hyphen
Lightening strike then I move like light wind
And when it comes to honey's disguising ponies
All right we check like I collect alimony
'Cause my sex game is probably the best thing
Rock the matches right off your bed frame
To all you chicks I play it like chess game
Head game intent should of gave you a next brain
So many dimensions I ain't even mentioned yet
Marble floors, a remodel kitchenette
Silk linen, pool and a hot tub
Henchmen guard the fence to the shotguns
You could be a victim but not son
Catch a couple of hot ones, fucking with the top don
I'm the King the rest of y'all are far gone
Peace to Hash, the double P's and Bronze</pre>
