[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I'll, I'll be the shooter, I'll, I'll be the shooter
I'll, I'll use the pump, the taurus or the ruger
I'll pop somethin through ya, dirty is what I'll do ya
I'll, I'll use the cig, the pump or the german luger
I'll, I'll be the shooter, I'll, I'll be the shooter
I'll, I'll use the pump, the taurus or the ruger
I'll pop somethin through ya, dirty is what I'll do ya
I'll, I'll use the cig, the pump or the german luger
I'll, I'll be the shooter

[Verse One: 50 Cent]
I'll bang out, I'll, I'll, I'll bang out
Find out shit is real when I'm at you with that thang out
Cause all kind of commotion when a nigga get blast off
The spot we'll get his cash off that after no mask off
Pussy your heart pumpin but your brain gone
Think somethin sweet I snatch the heat and get the flame throwin
I stuff two different caliber shells in my revolver
Thirty eight, thirty two, Ross you got a problem
Start me I'll never stop I'm layin at your mama's spot
Squeeze till the llama hot I'll have your ass in drama ack
I'll cause havoc you come in my vicinity
Mother fuck the police officer Rick the enemy!!!!!

[Chorus: 50 Cent] (Lloyd Banks)
I'll, I'll be the shooter, I'll, I'll be the shooter
I'll, I'll use the pump, the taurus or the ruger
I'll pop somethin through ya, dirty is what I'll do ya
I'll, I'll use the cig, the pump or the german luger
I'll, I'll be the shooter, I'll, I'll be the shooter
I'll, I'll use the pump, the taurus or the ruger
I'll pop somethin through ya, dirty is what I'll do ya (YEAH!)
I'll, I'll use the cig, the pump or the german luger
I'll, I'll be the shooter

[Verse Two: Lloyd Banks]
Uh, it's been +Deeper than Rap+, I eat, shit, go to sleep with my gat 
It's us three against the industry, let's keep it like that 
Click-CLACK, getcha goons, fuck all the talkin 
Niggas yappin 'bout who dress the best, get 'em Gucci coffins 
When we tombstone, bullets hurt, 40s' break a few bones 
Come around, ya fool! And my shorty's takin jewels home 
Follow 'em then hallow 'em, take two these and goggle 'em 
You ride wid 'em, you die wid 'em, chances of survival thin 
The sharks is out you divin in? Dare you niggas try to swim 
There's no odds, I gotta win, wobble 'em with the WHOP-WHOP
Shaky backgrounds, you probably with the cops 
You ain't street, you need to stop, I breathe the hood, I be the block
Heater 

[Chorus: 50 Cent] (Tony Yayo)
I'll, I'll be the shooter, I'll, I'll be the shooter
I'll, I'll use the pump, the taurus or the ruger
I'll pop somethin through ya, dirty is what I'll do ya
I'll, I'll use the cig, the pump or the german luger
I'll, I'll be the shooter, I'll, I'll be the shooter (Yeah!)
I'll, I'll use the pump, the taurus or the ruger     (Right!!)
I'll pop somethin through ya, dirty is what I'll do ya
(WE GON' RIDE ON ALL Y'ALL NIGGAS ONE BY ONE!!)
I'll, I'll use the cig, the pump or the german luger
I'll, I'll be the shooter

[Verse Three: Tony Yayo]
Niggas wanna kill me, I'm gettin money for God sakes 
That purple-urple fucked Phelps up with Corn Flakes 
Kick in the door man, big .44 man 
Mortician morgue man, fill you with straws man 
Black President, I voted for Obama 
I voted in the hood, so I voted with my llama 
Everyday is drama, everyday is karma 
He got SHOT last week, so let's press his baby mama 
That was home of the boldest, adolesence whylin
Shorty got killed, they burin sneakers on the island 
+Maybach Music,+ y'all niggas want trouble? 
I run up on that C.O. snap his ass in a bubble

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I'll, I'll be the shooter, I'll, I'll be the shooter
I'll, I'll use the pump, the taurus or the rueger
I'll pop somethin through ya, dirty is what I'll do ya
I'll, I'll use the cig, the pump or the german lueger
I'll, I'll be the shooter, I'll, I'll be the shooter
I'll, I'll use the pump, the taurus or the rueger
I'll pop somethin through ya, dirty is what I'll do ya
I'll, I'll use the cig, the pump or the german lueger
I'll, I'll be the shooter</pre>
