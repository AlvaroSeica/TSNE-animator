Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Boots Riley: repeat 2X]
I fly like paper, get high like planes
If you catch me at the border I got warrants in my name
If you come around HEY we workin all day
Your life gon' pass you in a second if you wait

[Boots Riley: repeat 2X]
Just like Jesse James when I'm sittin on trains
Every step we get you see we're clockin that game
Dog food for dinner, the world is in flames
Bonafide hustlers makin that change, now

[Chorus 2X: Boots Riley]
All they wanna do is {*RIFF RIFF RIFF RIFF*}
And a {*BASS LICK*} and take your money
All they wanna do is {*RIFF RIFF RIFF RIFF*}
And a {*BASS LICK*} and take your money

[Boots Riley: repeat 2X]
Pirate skulls and bones
Sticks, and stones, and bullets and bongs
Runnin when we hit 'em
A little poison for the system!

[Chorus]

{*musical solo interlude*}
