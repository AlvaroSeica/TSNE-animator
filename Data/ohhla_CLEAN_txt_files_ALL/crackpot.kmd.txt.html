[Mr. Hood]  Follow this avenue (yeah) turn right at the corner (uh-huh)
            go to the left when you reach the square. (yeah)
            It is the house next to the theater.
[Zev Love]  Ohh.  Huh.  Yeah I know the line of work you're in, yeah.
[Mr. Hood]  Would you care for a spoon?  They are not too expensive.
[Zev Love]  No go, I don't deal with that stuff.
            As a matter of fact...

This reminds me of the days of dwelling with those who
killed off the weak for fancy clothes and hoes too
Not opposed to the picket fence dream
Where both lines are same side of the gate
It seems that it's all coming back to me now
Yeah ummmmm ahhhhhh I figured it was about two summers ago
No joking, no I lie to win
Cause it was a crackpot, yeah Crackpot Jenkins
I first met Crackpot in like Head Starts
And then I knew he wasn't too head smart cuz I scribbled in art
He insisted on standing in the sandbox to collect unknown
amounts of pebbles and stones to throw rocks
Dissin the wrist he flicked was suddenly an early physics lesson
Two atoms can't occupy the same space
at the same time, acknowledged by the playground's boot to wesson
Who felt pops rock then cracked pops face
Considering his aim, I warned he could hurt others with his game
Ms. Kristmahn warned the same
Although, he didn't care the heat cuz in a decade and one year
He continued to throw rocks for a career
Pain and more pain as he pelt rocks felt by
Every brother and brown will soon be dealt
One more rock thrown, ahh shoot
Under the van was a boy in a blue suit
Still a lot of rock throwin goin on up the block
But a pocket full of pebbles what locked up Crackpot
Should've used his wrists for the cut like Subroc
Maybe then he'd have avoided the cacophony jackpot
Yeah, the phony jackpot

[Zev Love]  Yo man, we got much better things to do with your time
[Mr. Hood]  Show me something better
[Zev Love]  What, something better?  We built this place man.
            We're the Gods of the Universe, Kings and Queens
            of the planet.
(If you or I could see this individual, we might call him an
 impractical dreamer, or a crackpot.)
[Zev Love]  No, I'm not crackpot.
(Would you have seen the scientific, intellectual, creative
 genius, in a small ragged negro boy?)
[Zev Love]  Uh-oh, uh-oh, ohh no.  You're gonna set it off!
