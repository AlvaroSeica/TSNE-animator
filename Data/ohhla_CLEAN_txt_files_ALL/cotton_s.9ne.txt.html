Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Chorus]
They ain't on your side, the look in they eyes'll
let you know when you funkin they gon' hide from the ride
The cotton soldier... cotton soldier
Yeah long time aside, and still right beside
Like who's the first swab of cotton to slide when he died/dyed
The cotton soldier... cotton soldier

[Tech N9ne]
I re-member this fool I used to work with
Somebody I used to trust and even sold work with
Spectacular how people love this black vernacular
But back in your talkin he's the one who takes the first lick
Seems like there's nothin that could stop this fool
Seemed like nobody up in the hood could ever drop this fool
I can hear him - "I'll beat a nigga, I'll shoot a nigga
I'll kill a nigga, I'll do a nigga"
But ain't nobody ever seen, this niggarole dump no magazine
'Til one day, on a Sunday, in a Hyundai
Several niggaz at the park in the back of the ride
I stepped outside it was a good play
I said "Whattup" they said "Whattup?!"
Looked at my boy said "Whattup?"
The toughest nigga in the universe ain't givin a fuck
I'm stuck in between, heaven and hell and hell seems
to lean, my way, no Heaven's Highway this ain't my day
Ay ay - punk ass nigga won't jump out he punked out
Just me and my opponents start to burnin like trick I know this
I'm on it - but check out the way it turned out
Them niggaz rushed me and my shifty partner burned out
I got my ass beat! In the middle of the street
I'm still alive and I told ya 'bout this soft ass cotton soldier

[Chorus]

[Tech N9ne]
You wanna know, who's made of cotton?
It's that buster with the rich in yo' illegal plottin
Sittin in the holdin tank and wonderin how much time you're facin
Nigga done told the whole shebang up in interrogation
No escapin, no protectin, I'm servin cause this rat bastard mastered
the art of tellin from killings to dope sellin
My facial is stone, aggravation is grown cause now I recall when the cops said
"Hands on the hood put down the goods keep all the merchandise right here c'mon!"
Heard the snitch was up in Cameron stammerin
Cause niggaz know a snitch, will end up dead or become somebody's bitch
Think of how it's, funny seein him, singin ballads
to a cell and the next minute he's tossin a motherfuckin salad
I was told, cotton swab ass niggaz catch blows
Supposed to be rough and then froze
Said he was down, but now I'm downtown awaitin trial
In my cell I can't wait to fold ya, soft-ass cotton soldier

[Chorus]

[Tech N9ne]
Just like a little B, you're such a little broad
Cotton soldiers be from here to Cape Cod, your whole facade's
unbelievable, I'm illegal so {jacking from OHHLA} hand me the gat
Cause this cotton soldier's making actions like Sammy the Rat
If I'm in a scrap, I expect you to have my back
And kick some ass like a motherfuckin Democrat
But you procrastinated, now you become belated
A villain and he's hated, a gun associated, I state it
The cotton soldiers get the 86 cause lady shit
and shady clips in 96 will get them niggaz heiny kicked
In 97 we wettin, the cotton swabs
If you had to be rough to work a shift nigga I'd be stoppin jobs
I spits the real niglets, and I leave you stung like bumblebees
Some of these, lightweight niggaz, blow away like tumbleweeds
Go away like humble G's, don't be tryin to, motor
B.G. too heezy that means he'll be a cotton, soldier
