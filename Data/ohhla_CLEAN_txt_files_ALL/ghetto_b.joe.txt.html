[Intro: Joe Budden]
Uh-huh-uh, always had big dreams
E'rybody had big dreams though
I ain't never wan' stay here, I had no intentions
I never had no plans, uh

[Chorus: Emanny]
Live, my, life
Gotta know how to survive
Just, can't, hide
These streets eat you alive
Living in the ghet-to, burbs
Cause I'm from two different worlds
Ghet-to, burbs
Comin from the ghetto burbs

[Joe Budden]
Yo, yo; ghetto burbs, I'm from the ghetto of Jers'
From where the peddlers serve, use hand gestures for words
Big-up to L.A., they was ahead of the curve
My hood we gang bang, you can get left on the curb
Yup I was raised here, but I'm tryin to export
Police is crooked, the strippers is escorts
Like my homie Layla, really I can't knock her
Cause she gettin paper, month ago she was knocked up
Baby daddy a dope boy, first homie was locked up
But he on the same shit, fucked around and got shot up
In my same mind, I'm like why he even bother?
At the same time don't know what he was a part of
Layla over the casket, tears comin harder
The hood wins again, another son with no father
Gotta take it in stride, 'round here that's the usual
But I ain't accustomed, that shit I can't get used to
I'm tryin to survive

[Chorus]

[Joe Budden]
Yo; ghetto burbs, I'm from the ghetto of Jers'
From where the ghetto's disturbed, you can be dead in a hearse
Say a prayer daily, and end it with better or worse
I lost faith but grandma still keep her head up in church
Murder is sky high, employment is real low
Little kid tryin to rap, but will he get a deal? No
Cause poverty kills slow, belief is beyond ya
7 out of every 10 bitches here got the monster
like my lil' homie Tanya, I met her at Freaknik, freak shit
The same bitch the niggaz be all out in the street with
Open, in love with her service
But she got resentments you won't see from the surface
Feel like so many women look where should she worship
Caught AIDS from rape and thought her whole life was worthless
Hoe couldn't know how gorgeous her curves is
She fuckin 'em raw and hope they catch it on purpose
You better survive

[Chorus]

[Joe Budden]
Uhh, ghetto burbs, I'm from the ghetto of Jers'
I ain't tryin to act like my part of the ghetto's the worst
Niggaz is tricks here, they'll buy stilettos for birds
How did I get here? They act like the metal don't hurt
Dudes just gettin high, guess they tryin to escape it
Or commit suicide assumin they couldn't take it
The streets is cold, still we run around naked
Success is a void and we replace it with hatred
That's your homie from way back, from so many years old
But friends turn green, even that actin weird old
You think he cared? No~! Y'all used to share clothes
Now you struggle for rent and he got ice in his earlobe
Your man won't even extend a hand, meetin all his career goals
You need a whole 'nother plan, your career is froze
Valuables are more valuable
than e'rything, even valued the dude
Cause you gotta survive

[Chorus] - 2X

[Outro: Emanny]
Ayy! Ohhh
Comin from the ghetto burbs, hey
Yeah! Gotta know how to survive
Streets eat you alive, hey!
Oooh! Ohhh, ayy
Comin from the ghetto burbs, ohh no no
Said the streets eat you, alive, alive
Yeah-eahhhh, yeahhhhhhh yeah yeah!
Oooh! No-ohhhhh
Comin from the ghetto burbs, yeah
Ohhhhhh, whoa-ohhh-ohhh
Ohhh, ohhh, ohhh, ohhh, ay</pre>
