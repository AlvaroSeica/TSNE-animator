Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
And you know I like everything that make sense
If I wasn't rappin' I'll probably take bricks
I be in the Trap, yeah I work the late shift
My brother sip codeine like he stay sick
Annnddd niggas still on that hatin' shit
You a worker, I can tell you don't make shit
Glock got no safety, but I'm safe bitch
Shawty got good brain, don't waste it
Yeeeaaah, my whole crew in the place bitch
Off lean movin' slow like the Matrix
Annnddd I'm the man in different states bitch
They know the words, I ain't even gotta say shit
Annnddd all my hoes they thick
Annnddd I'm allergic to the fake shit
Annnddd my mama told me that I ain't shit
When the cops grabbed me I ain't say shit

[Chorus]
Yeeeaaah, my whole crew in the place bitch
Yeeeaaah, my whole crew in the place bitch
Yeeeaaah, my whole crew in the place bitch
They know the words, I ain't even gotta say shit
[x2]

[Verse 2]
Young niggas got tools, they'll drop shit
Watch the world go crazy when I drop this
Lil Bibby, all I do is spit hot shit
When you hit the mall, you don't never cop shit
Yeeeaaah, tell them niggas top this
Yeeeaaah, them haters can't stop this
Nawww, I don't do that bop shit
And they know I had dimes like Stockton
Yeeeaaah, my whole crew in the place bitch
These rap niggas broke, niggas ain't rich
I just tell it like it is on that 'Ye shit
You was poppin tryna throw it in my face bitch
Yeeeaaah, tell them haters quit talkin'
Yeeeaaah, tell yo bitch quit stalkin'
Yeeeaaah, my whole crew gettin' off
Shorty goin' cause my whole clique ballin'

[Chorus]</pre>
