Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

One second, hold up, I got a couple things to say
{*scratched: "And you know, and I know, I'm nice like that" - Guru*}

[Jake Lefco]
You know I'm nasty and nice, a white rapper you like
You pass me the mic, and ask for advice
Well, tell the truth, do what you said you would do
Don't, listen to fools don't, give into rules
So, dig Lef, the next level of respect
I get it from good kids and rebels on the set
I get it from the best, from the worst, from the West
From the East, from police, from the streets, from my friends
Rip it like a beast, tear the beat to shreds
Leavin opposition dead, eat their heads
When it's all said and done I want peace instead
I'm nice, I want the right things to reach the kids
I'm nasty, like lapdances and trash can lids
Like the image of America for Afghan kids
I'm nice like an ocean cruise or mountain views
I'm nasty, like eatin cornflakes with Mountain Dew
Hot like glue, keep my cool like Sneaux shoes
Fuck with MPC's, SP's and Pro Tools
I know, you know, they know too, it's so true
Lefco is so new, the rest is old news

[Chorus]
Look I know, and you know, that they know, I'm nasty
No need to say so, no need to ask me
I know, and you, and they know, I'm nice
Right? Right. Right? Right. Right? Yeah~!
{*"And you know, and I know, I'm nice like that"*}
{*"Nas-tee!"*}
{*"And throw down some ice for the nicest MC" - B.I.G.*}
{"Yeah y'all"}

[Jake Lefco]
Yeah you know, the work of poet, gettin you open
The crop reportin and the hoein, raw emotion
The song's in motion and out of focus
I'm nasty like halitosis, or have you noticed? I'm braggadocious
I spit potion, in heavy doses
That's the leading cause of jealous notions in weak opponents
Keep me posted, I like to know when I'm hated
I might get a kick out of it after I'm famous
I'm nice like old neighbors, white like rolling papers
Alright let's place a wager, I'm tight, you know the flavor
Some cats are overrated, that's an understatement
Amen, I'm in the basement with innovation
See Jake left flows for motivation insanity
I don't care for hoes, ovations or vanity
Can he be so nasty and so classy?
You know he can be, baby please don't ask me
Big ups to Happ G, Snuffman, get at me
Doc know exactly what I'm talkin about
Out nights touchin mics with the rowdy types
I think without rap I'd live a lousy life
It sounds nice, with a downright nasty spice
Blame ignorance the first time, don't ask me twice

[Chorus]

[Jake Lefco]
I come off like double G bras and leopard print drawers
off of porn stars, cause you are lost if you miss it
Like brickin free throws at the finish
You're panic stricken, you put yourself in that position, why?
You'll say I'm nice and nasty, quite crafty
Try to blast me your lyrics whistle right past me
Don't ask me to break it down, I'm done repeatin myself
Listen, let the words speak for themselves
Now, how could you question my dedication without
even, hearin me out like you know what I'm about
I'm proud to be a, leader, eager crowd pleaser
A speaker, make a loud speaker sound weaker
I'm all about beaver, big blunts and reefer
And leisure, snuff beats and half G heaters
I'm nice like cool teachers, nasty like leeches
Stuck on the mic spittin for all the right reason
I'm decent dawg, you musta got it all wrong
I caught you off guard, I'm nicer than you thought
You heard how I turned out the cipher at the bar?
The word's out, it turns out, I'm nicer than you are

[Chorus]

{*"And you know, and I know, I'm nice like that"*}
{*"Nas-tee!"*}
{*"And you know, and I know, I'm nice like that"*}
{*"Nas-tee!"*}
{*"And you know, and I know, I'm nice like that"*}
{*"Nas-tee!"*}
{*"And you know, and I know, I'm nice like that"*}
{*"Nas-tee!"*}</pre>
