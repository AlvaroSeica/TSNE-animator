Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Said the man
Who feel him a fool
For he be the wiseman
For the man
Who don't think he's a fool he
Control his destiny
But he's too cool for himself
For himself
For himself
All I need
Is something to keep me movin' on
In a world
Where violence reigns
And everybody seems so strange to me
Said the man
Who feel him a fool
For he be the wise man
For the man
Who dont feel him a fool he
Control his destiny
Yeah he's too cool for himself
For himself
For himself
Ohhhh ohhh ohhhh oh
This weapon of destruction
Swallows peoples suffering
And no confusion
You aint winnin' if your losin'
We don't need
Said the man
Who feel him a fool he
For he be the wiseman
For the man
Who don't think he's a fool he
Control his destiny
But he's too cool for himself
For himself
For himself
Oh</pre>
