[Intro: The RZA, (Beretta 9)]
yo, what up, dunn, (yo, yo, yo)
aiyyo, peace, yo, what up, dunn
(word, just watching the studio
got all the word on the street)

(for a minute went to the store, you know)
caught them cats at store
some bugged out shit was going on last night
fucking with them niggaz off the av. and shit
you know (word) niggaz be bugging out there
(yo, what's the word on the street)
yo, fuck that, yo

[The RZA, (Beretta 9)]
i heard cops raided the weed spot and four deep
they backed two dreads in the eighty ?gymtory?
you know who i mean, he moved from shaolin to queens
fronting like he was down with the escobar team
(i heard t.t. got shot in the ass for some wiz
and binky caught two to the ass, but, yo, he lived)
and plus little duck and love, they got busted
(tell them niggaz, don't be slinging while they dusted)
see, me little cousin shawn and his man royce
(yea, shawn broke his arm on the basketball court)
word, his sister febe got cut off from welfare
and those two nappy head kids got sent back to child care
bastard, he got slapped by ?mouth gib?
acting like he had an arm to take in his crib
(yea, that faggot ass nigga caught that beef from his rib)
it's the projects, dunn, you got one life to live
(murder, caught 2-4, homicide)
mental rhyme disorder shit but never testified
hold on, god, chill, my other line
(make it fast, kid, don't have me on hold for a long time
it's twenty cents a call and i only got a dime
it's hot on the block and i'm surrounded by crime)
yo, aiyyo, chica-check the draw that was my little niggaz hama
he said he just got some power-u from your niece tanya</pre>
