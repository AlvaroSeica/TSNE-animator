[Chorus]
Look at all the time men are wastin'
Dying for lack of this information
And we're not just thrilled to be giving it out
We're skilled at living it out. Heels, we're diggin' them out
Grab your cross, plus hold it down
Stand strong young soldier, hold your ground
Stickin' Christian flag poles in the ground
Rep what you believe and soon you'll receive your golden crown
 
It goes like this
there's not a single soul righteous
A plague's struck us like a boxing pro's tight fist
Hearts are cold like ice is you know what the price is
Separation like a
divorced husband and wife is
Life is a climb up the hill like Lauren and Cypress
Man without Christ is like keyboards without a typist
God's gripe is with sin and we who seem to like it
Instead of snipe it
We'll call Williams so he can hype it
But if you saw 
the measuring rod that God was holdin', you'd know you fall
shorter than Webster and Gary Coleman
The whole man---mind, body, and soul---sin's controlin'
It's like you're · programmed and need cleansing like a colon
Hit the dugout, 'cause ever since we told God to butt out
we've been · scoreless like a wack team that's being shut out
We cut out God like a coupon
won't trust Him like we won't two cons
So days are gray like Poupon
Full of pain like a toe with two corns with small shoes on
Not the same like Star Wars before Luke's born
God can see the cu' form
Who's side are you on? Infinite wisdom
versus the brains of a newborn
Dangerous like unskilled men putting a roof on
Deadly like firing every single nuke-bomb
 
[Chorus]
 
Jesus went out on a limb so He could deal with sin
And be the bridge to bring sinful men back to Him
I heard he was the Surgeon, I heard He ripped the curtain
Now God and man can start mergin'
Virgin's exclusivity is what He's after
The Master's captured hearts, we'll marry at the rapture
I hear the laughter but what's
Worth giving up the chance to see the Son of God in a tux
It's a pain I can only go cry on a train ride
Brains fried from the ism and the saint Ives
Ain't wise yet the whole earth's on the same side
Them against the God who made the earth and His name's I Am
That I Am, Jesus Son of Man
He be the Lamb and Daddy to Uncle Sam
Universal land lord or the Supreme court
heaven's king, earth's life support
Boy, sin's got you locked, you're mad spoiled
But like aluminum, you humans will get your plans foiled
Your heart be the soil, I've got the seed
The word of God, it's heard a broad and it starts breeds of
Believers Jesus look a likes
God lovers, sin haters, look the mic 
Can be used as a tool to voice God's views
Jesus must be the choice all choose 
All loose if they snooze on the One bruised
Arms are too short and can't fit the Son's shoes
On the one two's the good news comes to all men
Who truly went out on a limb
