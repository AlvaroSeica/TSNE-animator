You know the blocks heat
When the punks creep
Funds run steep
Peep when they crunch teeth
In the city grief
Deep when the tongues leap
A Fleet charge put a heart to the concrete
Heat it's heat peeps livin' under tyrannies
Heatin up inside till they take their thunder to the streets
Unleash info wikileak technique
Spit deep
Preparin for the journey to the 6-feet
Death is a fact  that we all know
so ain't about if we die its bout how we go
Peep the real issue
Its so official
We hit like hard hammers
You just water pistols

Aiyyo I rock a rhythm its not any given
its not just about winnin but how you dealin
this is hip hop started wit a message fam
so amidst the heat I'm lookin at the bigger plan
Aiyyo I rock a rhythm its not any given
its not just about winnin but how you dealin
this is hip hop started wit a message fam
so amidst the heat I'm lookin at the bigger plan

Flocks rock cane
Drop when the cops Came
Toss high octane
Plot for a shot o'  fame
Stop he got
Diagnosed Insane
Lost off lane
Ridin on the wrong train
In the city where you struggle thru or feel the pain
ey Car lights Whizz past like bond james
Words powerful
I gotta make it realer
Than a recycled rhyme
By a fake killer
Heat
Ya raps weak out like mercury
Unanimously whack says the whole jury
You can testify   why this is a journey
Early awake posture sturdy
The click comes thru
arms thats powerful
fist a fury
we Tawhid is unity

Aiyyo I rock a rhythm its not any given
its not just about winnin but how you dealin
this is hip hop started wit a message fam
so amidst the heat I'm lookin at the bigger plan
Aiyyo I rock a rhythm its not any given
its not just about winnin but how you dealin
this is hip hop started wit a message fam
so amidst the heat I'm lookin at the bigger plan

All I need is 2 turntables and a mic  right
An MC thats spittin that nice
Forget gimmicks up the sleeves and get nice
They wants souls on ice
Its a pity but nobody said it be easy
Oh really yeah tonight gotta breathe deeply
Peep the real issue
its so official hittin hard hammers you just water pistols</pre>
