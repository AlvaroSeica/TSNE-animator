It's so simple..
I see through too easily
the measly moves, that you make
got no place in my leisurely time
I'm pleased with these rhymes I continue
Spied you at the venue last night
You said you went to the opera
well look how I got ya
Be tryin to go to my show
little did you know, little is your ego
Everywhere that we go
they're linin up to lie to me
Lookin not so fly to me
alone, I zone in all your motives
I doubt you really know my scrotum
If I didn't rap tight I'd be the same man;
just alone last night
I'm knowin, you wanna be up on it on me
cause it makes you
Nothing I can relate to, I'm here
to break you in, like a mitt then get
where the fuck you fit up out of my shit
You speak in gibberish, vigorous just for complex
Don't take me out of context
Moms askin me one thing
but another's just a problem
I'm ?? freakin goblin, you do it to the knob'n
when you slob oh then it's cool
I've never been hurt
by a bit or two I admit a fool I act
often can I nope and let it slip into my raps
like my dick into the crack of freakin females
break em off like Lee nails
Pocket pussies with legs and heads
??into the pants?? from many said this way
Accept it on the under
Makes me wonder what you think
but then again I give a fuck
I live it up until I'm down and out
Old as hell, frownin bout
my baldheaded limp cock
but I'm all that with a pimp walk
to save me, maybe then you can call me crazy
For now, raise me up in your headphones
What the fuck?  GROUCH!
Another nut..

Never waste my life, don't recommend you do
When I bust suck it up here it comes I'll shoot you
Catch it, in the socket of your eye knockin why
we gotta shoot like it write it that way on purpose

Never waste my life, don't recommend you do
When I bust suck it up here it comes I'll shoot you
Catch it, in the socket of your eye knockin why
we gotta shoot like it write it that way on purpose

Never waste my life
Never waste my life
Stickin doin it
No pretend, til the end of time
It don't cease, til I get, my piece</pre>
