[Chorus]
I got a pole in the middle of my ride
for a freak if she down to get inside
I got a hole in the wall in my 'Lac
I got a DJ in the trunk to bring it back
I got a shake junt in my, shake junt in my trunk
I got a shake junt in my, shake junt in my trunk
I got a shake junt in my, shake junt in my trunk
I got a shake junt in my, shake junt in my trunk
I got a shake junt

[Big K.R.I.T.]
I'm countrier than a motherfucker shawty, Cadillac with elbows of Vogues
Me and you, your cousin too, my wheels will still shine, gleam and glow
Type of whip you never seen before, colder than a million below
Left my top at home on the low, left my top at home just for show
Drop top, make them pros bop with they toes out
Offset, leave them hoes wet, like a boat huh?
Smoked out, lungs choked out, what you know bout
cracking seals in 'Lac de Villes when the club done closed down?

[Chorus]

[Big K.R.I.T.]
I'm super clean, forever show my grill
Pop my trunk, depend on how I feel
Gator shoes with belt to match the brim
Getting head's my Achilles' heel
Buy high, but never left the curb
Fly formation with the planes and birds
Over other players I emerge
And that's before I even smoke the herb
Swag surf, swang fo', screw it up, ride it slow
Drop it low, red light, green light, stop and go
Lock and load, I got gwap to throw, make it rock and roll
Fuck the club, we can get buck in my eighty-foooooo'!
