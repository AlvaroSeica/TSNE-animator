My whole bein' of self is based on originality
Rhyme style quality
Backpack niggas follow me
Cause in this splendid business 
called rap shit is classified drastic
through schematics and formulated control
I unfold desired taste that contaminates the whole 
World-wide league in its entirety
Unison speak on topics far gone from the mission
I piss on fools, dismiss tricks who drool
Over material tools, systematic to the rule
I'm that cool ass nigga that you knew way back
Who always had the hot kicks and the flavor Polo caps
Clich√© free old school greatly
Appreciated from the jump cause it's what made me
9 years official respectable credible promise
I'm hot at killin' tangible 
I'm smarter than Hannibal
Rhyme animal
Completin' the trend through hot blends
From the Bricks beats to break
Verbal medicine
 
Focus your mind to the beats and rhymes
El da Sensei with a sign of the times
All true niggaz raise your hands up high
Ladies make noise if you body do or die
Bringing that shit straight from the Bricks
So what'chall know about that? True fuckin' fact!
 
Highly schooled in the ways of the MC and the art
Streetwise walk &amp; talk, strictly from the heart
Show my grit, determination
Patience and pain-stakin' creatin'
To show behind the scenes I'm not fakin'
I'm real with my shit, appeal to kids of all kinds
But when I'm rockin' at my shows hard cats I can't find
"Does it mean your shit is soft?" 
Naaah, think you're brainless, can't obtain this greatness of rap language
Polish it up stainless, personality famous
Without major changes my style is instantaneous 
Heinous when you don't take heed
I suggest your best spot, nigga, purchase for yourself a CD
To all my cats who support the true crowd stay reliable
Always up on shit when you're diggin' thru the vinyl
Sensei, cause &amp; effect considered nice
When the battle rhymes are written we can run it back twice

Focus your mind to the beats and rhymes
El Da Sensei with a sign of the times
All true niggaz raise your hands up high
Ladies make noise if you body do or die
Bringing that shit straight from the Bricks
So what'chall know about that? True fuckin' fact!

My superb-ness flourishes, better verses for the listener who nurses
The essence of the art and when it's workin'
For certain I'm the truth foolproof to spite
My separation from my group and how my label wasn't right
Still true to the mic and on my behalf
Non-believers kiss my ass with my album on blast
Seven Heads dot com, dot records, dot a skit (??)
Hotness prominent, design a rhyme or two legit
Excitement carefully spoken to keep ya open
Artist to the hardest, catch a beat like T. Owen
Sowin' rap seeds as I blanket the Earth
with my well-balanced talent that I claimed since birth
I was put here for a purpose,  what a fan told me
Never change B, not for the industry
"No worries" what I told him, I consoled his thoughts
I'm only here to give the grandest and flaunt what I was taught</pre>
