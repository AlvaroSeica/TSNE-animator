(*talking*)
Oh yeah, Screwed Up Click nigga
(Screwed Up Click nigga), they gon' be fighting off this one mayn
(put your dukes up nigga), throw your hood up (throw it up)

[Chorus]
Where my thugs (right here), where my dogs (right here)
Where my killers (right here), where my hustlers (right here)
Where my players (right here), where my bitches (right here)
Screwed Up Click for life, and we ain't going nowhere

[Lil' O]
Hey I'm a H-Town nigga, stay down nigga
Hop out in all black, and make you lay it down nigga
Screwed Up Click, won't play around nigga
Fuck all that owe me shit, pay now nigga
You talking to a dude, that rode the Greyhound nigga
Now hard and non-soft, and eight pounds nigga
Head outta town, and I made rounds nigga
Came back and got my Lac, sprayed down nigga

[Mr. 3-2]
A raw dog and big boss, and the boss number one
Mr. 3-2, put the clip in the gun
If you scared nigga run, or bitch go to church
I'm hungry and wanna eat, so motherfucker I will work
Hit em where it hurt, make em know when to talk
Ain't nothing like, big money in the vault
Grinding by the hour, ain't no slacking
Calling the shots, I'm straight Cadillac'ing

[Lil' Keke]
Knuckle up buckle up, cause we on a hog train
Bricks off in my luggage, cause I'm still hitting stangs
Rushing like Walter Payton, niggaz continue hating
Please try to take it slow, when you I-10 skating
Work off in the muffler, sorry I'm still a hustler
Cock mine load up, S.U.C. done blowed up
Tell the streets, that we still got it sewed up
Here come the click, and them boys hollin' hold up

[Chorus - 2x]

[H.A.W.K.]
Yeah it's H.A.W.K. baby, I walk the walk baby
I talk the talk baby, unload the vault baby
Gorilla salt baby, it ain't my fault baby
I drive these hoes crazy, that's what these streets made me
Now where my real thugs, y'all show y'all boy love
Whether you Crip or Blood, throw your hood up
And we gon' keep it real, no matter how ya feel
Nobody gon' get killed, real recognize real

[Mike D]
We got the roof the roof, the roof on fire
We don't need no water, let that mo'fucker burn
Burn mo'fucker, buuuurn
Who is that, now who is that
It's Corleone daddy, Boss Hogg daddy
I got the click right here, and we right back at it
Throw them bows playa, move your buns ma
This for my celly, that'll never see the sun ha

[Trae]
It ain't hard to see, that I'm a thug for life
I got a click full of killers, and they ready to fight
See Trae up in the game, and about to take flight
With a fist full of grain, and grind to late night
For my dogs on the block, and my niggaz on lock
I'ma rep the name, forever bleed my block
With a glock I got cocked, you boys gon' learn
When I pull up in the blue, my paint wetter than sherm
No time for hoes, and no time for haters
R.I.P. to Mafio, Fat Pat and Gator
Next nigga to talk down, the glock'll spray ya
When the click click up, can't nobody save ya
And it's on, whether late night to dawn
I'ma bomb on everybody, bringing up my home
S.U.C. for life, sitting on my throne
And for Screw you the Don, we gon' carry on

[Chorus - 2x]</pre>
