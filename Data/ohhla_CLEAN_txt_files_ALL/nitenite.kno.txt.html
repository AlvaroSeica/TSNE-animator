Seriously man
Like you know when you've got a good girl
Well you know when she means something to you
when you've got like a name
Like I had a name for this girl
I used to call her lady bird (here we go again)
Cos she always played red
In Connect Four (here we, here we go again)

Hook (Leo The Lion)
Link 'em and then leave then 'em high
I've been tellin all my man's for time
Link 'em and then leave 'em high
They never take my advice
But now I realise, I realise why
They have not been listening all this time
Cos since I linked you, last night
I won't be taking my advice

(Kano)
Look, I call her nite nite
Cos it seems from the day right to the bright light
That I like her too much to say bye-bye
And we were getting on fine right
I don't wana spoil it
I don't know why
I can't commit to girls
And I tell white lies
I'll find out the hard way cos shes got my favourite smile
My favourite style, the first hotel, my favourite time
But late and we could have a baby maybe
A baby boy my favourite child
I'm way too tired, my favourite lie
My verse I'm so sure her favourite rhyme
The windows are steamed up it's snaking time
Wait we're way too bait
I bought her her favourite shoes (well they better be)
And shes even my favourite size
And she knows I hate holding hands and I'm hooded up with this beat inside
So I guess shes my favourite right

(Leo The Lion)
Right, Cos nothing comes close to you

(Kano)
So numbers no boys are taking yours
And no girls are taking mine
Groupies? Fuck that, I'm taking time
We speak from like 8 till late at night
When we gets on top, drop my favourite line (girl I ain't going nowhere)

(Kano Speaking)
I plain ain't going nowhere
But, I like you, and it might take some time
But really I'm like

(Leo The Lion &amp; Kano)
Here we go again

(Hook)

(Kano)
I call her sometimes, and I wake her up at some dumb times
Touch my phone and her number my thumb finds
Cos shes ideal like a nice meal, and a night in with a nice film
Maybe some wine maybe sumtime we could
Hold hands in the park in the sunshine
Be patient with me if i've got three raves in a week
Or in the studio away for a week
One day we can book a vacation and leave
But please no drama
I don't need theives like them fools david and dean
I'm just focussed on making the peas
Braking the team chasing the dream
I ain't on the street, maybe sometimes
You can't say I don't make enough time
We speak every day and meet every week
But I don't know maybe its me
You got it planned out
I don't make plans
You know me I wait and I see
But if we were together or even now If we weren't sort of, but we're together
Would you be faithful to me treat me with ? and make me a tea
Come link me babe, wake up from sleep and still look hot like 80 degrees
That's an angel to me
I always said that you would get me come back stinking of weed

(Leo The Lion)
And you know I never say that sort of thing

(Kano Speaking)
See? That's an angel to me
I wouldn't have said that before, you get me?

(Hook)

(Leo The Lion)
No, no, no, no, no, no
Oh my, my, ow
Baby we could do this again sometime
I even have a special name for you
It's 'Long Baby', cos you always on my mind, yeah
I'll tell you straight, so straight, yeah
I won't tell my mates (won't tell my mates)
No, no, I know, No, I know
Yeah I like you
Here we go
Here we go again
Here we
Here we go again</pre>
