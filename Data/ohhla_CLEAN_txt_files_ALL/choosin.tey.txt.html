Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Yeah, lil daddy, I see you looking at me
Know you wanna make it happen, so you better make a move
And I got it, just look at my body
Know you wanna get it popping, tell me what you wanna do
Yeah, so don't act like you ain't heard of me
Super swag with a bunch of bad girls around me
Yeah, now won't you back it up
And if I see a boy I like, I better bag him up

Yeah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
He choosin', he choosin', looking at my booty, looking at my booty
Lookin, lookin at my booty
He choosin', he choosin', looking at my booty, looking at my booty
Lookin, lookin at my booty
He choosin', he choosin', looking at my booty, looking at my booty
Lookin, lookin at my booty

This lil lady, be dropping boys crazy
If you see me in the building, then you know they have to pay me
All [?] throw it in the bag, then I'll leave in the Mercedes,
Yeah you know these broads [?] yeah, yeah
But don't act like you don't know about me, say my name
Or watch the [?] on me
Yeah, he gonna need back it up
And I'm the reason why your boy actin' up

Yeah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
He choosin', he choosin', looking at my booty, looking at my booty
Lookin, lookin at my booty
He choosin', he choosin', looking at my booty, looking at my booty
Lookin, lookin at my booty
He choosin', he choosin', looking at my booty, looking at my booty
Lookin, lookin at my booty

Ok, oh Teyana how I wanna, wanna see you dance
I don't really give a damn, you can go and tell your man
And I know you kinda busy, you can have me to your plans
I just wanna see you shake it, shake it, now I'm in a trance
Yes they play this song right here you know they gotta bring it back again
I know you ain't a stripper but I gotta throw a stack or 2
Beautiful immaculate, and her bag Louie
And when she [?] niggas look at that booty
Look at that booty, look at that booty, look at that booty
Look, look at that booty
Look at that booty, look at that booty, look at that booty
Look, look at that booty

Oh yeah, I'm choosin', looking at your booty
With your [?] tight pants, you're such a cuty
I might be looking at, making me wanna [?]
God damn [?] and she making me wanna
Her ass fat and I wonder if she gonna let me jump on her
Her booty lookin so pretty, I just wanna go feel it
[?] and I might fly you back in my city

Yeah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
He choosin', he choosin', looking at my booty, looking at my booty
Lookin, lookin at my booty
He choosin', he choosin', looking at my booty, looking at my booty
Lookin, lookin at my booty
He choosin', he choosin', looking at my booty, looking at my booty
Lookin, lookin at my booty</pre>
