[Sister Souljah]
If your white great-great grandfather
KILLED my great-great grandfather
And your white great grandfather
SOLD my great grandfather
And your white grandfather
RAPED my grandmother
And your father stole, cheated, lied and ROBBED my father
What kind of fool would I have to be to say, 
"Come, my friend!" to the white daughter and son?
 
[The President]
"Good evening America. This is your President. 
Please listen carefully to the announcement I'm about to make. 
After careful consideration and research, Vice President Duke, 
Congress, and myself have concluded that black people
have not advanced technologically. Their educational
testing scores are on a rapid decline. The vast majority of
them are on welfare and producing babies at a faster rate
than they can support them. We will not carry them anymore. 
We are left with no choice but to put slavery back
into effect. All blacks will report to the designated camps in
their area to receieve further orders. The only blacks
excused will be those serving in the United Staes military and
the Police. Any blacks who do not cooperate will be
terminated immediately. I repeat, slavery is back in effect"
 
[Sister Souljah]
WE ARE AT WAR!!! That's what I told ya!
I know you heard what the President said
And if the nigga don't move, {*gunshots*} then he's dead
It's time for us to take a stand
Woman to woman and man to man
Blood rushes through your veins you feel the fear
Who would've thought that it could happen here
Int he land of the free, home of the brave
THe year is '95, you're a slave!
Some go in shock when they first hear the news
Press play and then rewind and review
But the message is CLEAR and it cuts like a knife
You don't surrender they'll take your life
And I remember, the movies my momma used to show me
({*whip cracks*} "What's ya name?!" "...Tobey")
Remember the times when they bought and they sold ya
WE ARE AT WAR!!!!! That's what I told ya!
 
[Chorus]
Slavery's back in effect, slavery's back in effect
(That's what I told ya!)
Slavery's back in effect, slavery's back in effect 
("Re-FUSE to LOSE"
