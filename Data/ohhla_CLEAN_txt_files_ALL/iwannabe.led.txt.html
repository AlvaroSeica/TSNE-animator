[Intro: Future] + (DJ Khaled)
It ain't nothin' me to ball on you (hustlers)
It ain't nothin' for me to spoil you (another one)
If I adore you, I'mma give you that theory (We The Best Music, DJ KHALED!)
Yeah-yeah, yeah; I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you {*3X*}

[Nicki Minaj]
I wanna be where the commas will be but I need a hood nigga with the llama degree
Get the limited edition, Audemars, it could be in a pivotal position, gotta pardon the fee
Cause he bought a couple bags and he sent a couple whips and he took a couple trips, then its dinner and a Myx
And he's never with no other bitch, fronting like he's slick cause it's levels to this shit and she could never be Nic
Niggas be fallin' in love with this pussy, mean stew chicken, and bake him a couple of cookies
Dick on veteran, ain't fucking with rookies, shot the High School video now he wanna play hookie
Baddest bitch, I'm the catalyst, ain't never been done, bitch I added this
Nah, I ain't gotta shoot, I got mad assists, 'bout to put a couple pieces on the mannequin
Got a big billboard out in Madison at the Trump, and you bitches at the Radisson
Got the .22 on me, and it's thin; shoot movies, Jennifer Aniston
You-you-you decide you'll be mine you can come inside
You the type that can make me prioritize
Hittin' my phone, it's alright
Hittin' my phone, it's alright
You reply, what's your sign? You're a Gemini
You deny that you're shy, maybe we should slide?
I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you, baby

[Chorus: Future]
Yeah-eah-eah; ballin' on you too easy, splurgin' on you too easy
Buyin' purses too easy, payin' bills too easy
I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you {*4X*}
Ballin' on you too easy, splurgin' on you too easy
Buyin' cars too easy, poppin' bottles too easy
I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you
Everything you do is brand new (it's brand new-ew-ew)

[Rick Ross]
Uhh... {M-M-M-Maybach Music}
Make that bad bitch my shorty, hit the club, throw forty
My hat bent like "uhh", my chain drip like water
Car paint like tar, I'mma sex her harder
Bitch let go my hand gave you the keys as soon as I bought it
Voom, voom, oh yeah, big bank, I'm too real
My money right in them boys you with be dead broke, two years
Checked it, look here, you ain't even know, big deal
On site, act right, I shop hard, pack light
That ho chick gets you no play, all I talk is cocaine
White tee and these rope chains, blow the roof back - Kurt Cobain
Phantom cost like four dollar, flo' seats, hoes holla
Underground with this pimp shit so smoke one for Port Arthur

[Chorus]

[Outro: DJ Khaled] + (Future)
+Suffering From Success+
You witnessin' greatness..
I'm the best that ever did it; I wanna be with you
(I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you) {*4X*}</pre>
