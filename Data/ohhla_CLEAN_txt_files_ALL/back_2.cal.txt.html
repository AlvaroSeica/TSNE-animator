[Silencer]
to all you mothafuckers who don't understand
the type of things that we go doing and we go so mad
Califa Thugs up in this die to die

Low Profile...is the label
paralyzing motherfuckers so fatal

sick baldheaded mothafuckers from the S.D

when you see me cruising through your town
bow down...Califa Thugs return
enemies are gonna die tonight so burn

[Sancho]
now there's  enemies walking around
I'm rolling through your neighborhood up to no good
so we could put it down
C-A-L-I-F-A to the T
H-U-G  nobody's fucking with me
as I came to do my thang with a G in the bag
you where the one who is behind
while I'm sippin champane
pimping these days the hoes that want me for my change
but you know they don't get thing
untill they do their nasty thing
to all the playa hating maggots and faggots
all on my nuts and can not handle a fucker that you can't have bitch
moving to the next another week of big thangs
I make this bitches titties bounce like a low ride at it's ben
watchu gonna do chick I like the way you move it
just don't wanna stare hoe so don't act stupid
cause I'm a Thug and I'm back to bust again
catch me on the calles always hustling
thuuuuuuuugs back 2 bust again
gangster in the streets always hustlin
thuuuuuuuugs back 2 bust again
you don't wanna fuck with these
thuuuuuuuugs back 2 bust again
gangster in the streets always hustlin
thuuuuuuuugs back 2 bust again
you don't wanna fuck with these thugs

[Lil Bandit]
mothafucker why you running
I'm not commin' and gunnin'
I'm commin' then go one on one
motherfucker no guns
streetlights out better bully blowed out a Thug
like me is knocking your ass out
I got my fist at your dome
one hit to quit they're quick at looking so sick at night time
so bring it on big figure
stepping like a fool tell you what to do when I'm comming through
run...that's all you better do
shake the spot but don't call the cops
If you do (Gun Shots!) that' the sound gun popping
stop and drop when you hear my millimeter cutting
I'm never stopin' I'm attackin your life at home
not when I'm rappin' and attackin' this microphone
my lyrics so amaculite why don't chu bring it on
lot of attention bettes of staying your ass at home  motherfucker</pre>
