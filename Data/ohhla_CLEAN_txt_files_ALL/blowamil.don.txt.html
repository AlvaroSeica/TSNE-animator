[Chorus: Aaron Wright]
The way she make it she gon make me blow a million
Take her around the world jus to show her how I'm livin'
Why you wan walkin' around actin like that
Like I won't like I won't go and buy that
Why you wan walkin' around actin like that
Like I won't like I won't go and buy that (x2)

[Verse 1]
Let me take you to a place to ride
In a position where I fantasise
I can't believe she got me open wide
Sometimes wonder if I'm livin' in a wicked dream
I'm gettin' twisted havin' visions like I'm in between
Her little body in the party got me
Rowdy and I'm still mobbin' hard like rollin' with Gotti
The maserati got you shakin' hard
You never kicked it with a brother in a foreign car
Dolce gabbana and prada it got me movin' proper
Her sex appeal is real another show stopper
I got you picture me rollin' just at the right time
Oh you heard I was ballin' through the grapevine
You know I'm gettin' mine

[Chorus: Aaron Wright]
The way she make it she gon make me blow a million
Take her around the world jus to show her how I'm livin'
Why you wan walkin' around actin like that
Like I won't like I won't go and buy that
Why you wan walkin' around actin like that
Like I won't like I won't go and buy that (x3)

[Verse 2]
I'm on my freak shit
First verse is even worse so baby peep this
Ain't got no time for no secrets
Know I'm the best
I'm steady lickin' on your breast
Got you beggin' for quickies
I'm puttin' hickies on your neck
It's just the way you got my mind blown
Fuck the rest
I love a bitch that can hold her own, no disrespect
Me and you against the nation, no fakin' we gonna make it happen
You satisfied with this thug shit and even rappin'
You know am fall down right besides you
You tryed to fall in love with this banger
Because I'm fly too watchin' the block from a distance
You got me handin' business you know I was always with it
Let's get it

[Chorus: Aaron Wright](Kasinova)
The way she make it she gon make me blow a million
Take her around the world jus to show her how I'm livin'
Why you wan walkin' around actin like that
Like I won't like I won't go and buy that
Why you wan walkin' around actin like that
Like I won't like I won't go and buy that (x3)

Oh oh oh oh
Am ready to go, am ready to go
(We had to tell a lie)

Oh oh oh oh
Am ready to go, am ready to go
(You know we livin' right)

Oh oh oh oh
Am ready to go, am ready to go
(We had to tell a lie)

Oh oh oh oh
Am ready to go, am ready to go
(You know we livin' right)

The way she make it she gon make me blow a million
Take her around the world jus to show her how I'm livin'
Why you wan walkin' around actin like that
Like I won't like I won't go and buy that
Why you wan walkin' around actin like that
Like I won't like I won't go and buy that
Oh oh oh oh</pre>
