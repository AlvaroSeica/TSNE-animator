Verse One:
{Lil' Ya}

Regional Manuel AKA Tec-9 stay strap keep a blunt
Don't give a fuck about one time(ha) jumped six
But now he's out gettin' paid(ha) Yella's doin' the bow 
So is Tec and the Lil' Ya damn it must be a dream 
I'm a born entertainer he's a lyrical fiend
Three black brother's love each other keep a fat check
Ain't a nigga in the city who can fuck with Tec boy
Went from quicker to key's left it all alone
Gettin' paid legal got the bitches all on his bone
Give him credit because he's all that 
But I got love and respect me for my nigga Tec

Chorus:

I got to give it up
Much respect for my nigga Tec fool
I got to give it up
Much respect for my nigga Tec
I got to give it up
Much respect for my nigga Tec
Yeah

Second Verse:
{Lil' Ya}

Started sellin' at eleven went to jail when he was twelve
Had him bond as a juvie and mutherfucker made bail
Went back in 91 they caught him with some weigh, a beamer
And a tec nine gun made it to the tenth dropped out and went the wrong way
Had the Lord in his heart so it's a better day there's only one Tec-9
Never be another nothin' like my daddy but more like
My big brother never let me slip kept my mind right
Scratch each other's back because we love livin' the
Legal life bein' a daddy in the rap world
Got a son that's one can't forget about his lil' girl
So you see he's a gangster fuckin' with the Tecster my nigga
Lil' Ya gonna have to check ya so be cool
Cuz you know there be a killin' you family's at your funeral
Me and Tec are chillin' like villain's nigga so don't rep on my set
Cuz I got love and respect for my nigga Tec

Chorus:

I got to give it up
Much respect for my nigga Tec fool
I got to give it up
Much respect for my nigga Tec
I got to give it up
Much respect for my nigga Tec
