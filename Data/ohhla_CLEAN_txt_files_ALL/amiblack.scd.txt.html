[Schoolly D]
Am I black enough for ya, America?
I don't need no {?? ice until this hair is cut ??}
All I need is, my blackness
Some others seem to lack this
Black joy, and my black vibe
Gonna be a black man til the day I die
I'm just, rough and tough, and takin no stuff
All I really wanna know y'all.. am I black enough?

	{*sung sample: "Am I black enough for ya?" 2X*}
Am I black enough?
	{*sung sample: "Am I black enough for ya?" 2X*}
	{*sung sample
	"We're gonna move on up, one by one
	 We ain't gonna stop until the work is done
	 Am I black enough, black enough for ya?
	 Am I black black enough, for ya?"*}

[Schoolly D]
I'm black!  Too damn powerful
{?? I'm still a bad boy, and get a hour full ??}
And if you tired of the other emcees
Well come on in and get a listen from me
Because the rhymes, fourteen carat
You suckers, you wanna grab it
But you run like a little bitty rabbit
Pullin my cape, is a very bad habit
Cocaine - you still smoke it
Homey dude, you must be jokin
My fat chain, I am chokin
All through the school, you should be votin
On the M-I-C, I'm like a pitbull
My brain my brain is so full
of words, verbs, adjectives pronouns
Come on in, and sit on down
Just listen, to what you been missin
On the floor, your eyes will glisten
I see you wishin, on the wishbone
My name Schoolly School, I'm never alone
Just, rough and tough, and takin no stuff
All I really wanna know y'all.. am I black enough?

	 Am I black enough, black enough for ya?
