[Intro]
Ayyy~! It's Tone Tone here - ughhhh
Ay dawg (ay) I don't think they like me when I pull up at that club
(Uh-uhhh) What make it bad I ain't gotta touch the door
They just lift up y'knahmsayin? (F'real Tone?) I'm gettin money mayne!
Ay whattup doe BP what it do I see you mayne (fo' sho' baby)
Ay, ay, whoa

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
My neck froze up, kush rolled up
The Patron in my cup, 32's on the truck
And I don't think they like, I don't, I don't think they like me
And I don't think they like, I don't, I don't think they like me

[Tone Tone]
Fly like a helicopter, crispy clean at the club
New Patron in my cup, monster wheels on the truck
Cadillac leather seats, ridin on some 23's
My chain snow cold it's like the cap to my neck freeze
My wrists froze up, that bubble kush get rolled up
M-I-A to Steadman Chevy clownin with my do's up
Shorty when I get paid, I went and got the peach paint
And slapped the Bentley grill on it, you actin like my feet stank
Alligator lap interior is on another level
Diamonds crease the wood stuntin on 'em pushin to the pedal
I got stacks in my pants, can't hold 'em in my hands
Around thirty grand like I just got my van
They say I'm arrogant cause I be talkin fly
In some Nike Airs like I'm walkin in the sky
I bang for my wifey, I know that I be icy
Like I said befo', I don't, I don't think they like me

[Chorus]

[Tone Tone]
Five for a show, just imagine how the stacks get
Extra five for a sixteen without a ad-lib
Get It Camp, we in pimpin like a six-fo'
Promoters pay me for my shows and I ain't got a video
When it come to swag he's so far from average
I ballin in D like a Piston at the Palace
From cars to the clothes what'cha need mayne I got it
Throw 24's on every vehicle that's just a habit
Call my kicks fadeaways, I keeps on fresh Jordans
Dolce &amp; Gabbana's on, and I'm still Air Force'n
Hit the strip club tossin stacks now shorty bouncin it
Got paper up the anus, real talk, I'm tired of countin it
Then I got a black Beemer make you hot if you stay
My top drop like albums when it get release dates
To my wifey, I know that I be icy
Like I said befo', I don't, I don't think they like me

[Chorus]</pre>
