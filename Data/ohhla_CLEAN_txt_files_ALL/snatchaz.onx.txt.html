[Chorus: Greg Valentine]
There's no sunshine in the city
That's the way it's going down
People kill and people dyin
Every time I turn around

There's no sunshine...

[Fredro Starr]
I roll wit purse snatchaz, the villains, and trespassers
Criminalist, and parole violators
I raidin wit regulators, invaded the instigators
Passed the procrastinators, rolled on retaliators
Roamin at home wit burglars, party wit murderers
Scandal big reelers, I sell coke to dope dealers
Ask the stash dealers, so rash the gat peelers
The time behind bars, ridin in stolen cars
Forty deuce six, posin hard, rollin large
Big pockets that pay, pistol black is big smackers
Back up the ally, attack us, waitin for the crackers
Smugglers, muggers, in the gutters wit ruck cutters
Runnin up on niggas for butter lovers, or whatever
Can't take it for hoppers cockers, by watchin cops and robbers
But kid it's, kinda fittest, quit this, money get this
For beaters wit heaters to bleed us, and speed us, and 2 seaters
Crime essence and crime confessions, yea pure precious
My guess is good as yours, while niggas be takin draws
Rapers and zipper rippers, take rappers and over actors
Bottle throwers, the buddha rollers
I roll wit cigar smoke flowers
Boilers wit playas, slashes bashes Mercedes
Always solicit, and pullin out on project business
Schemin and scandalous, the dreamers and pan handlers
Ready to run up in Rockefeller, put the glock in the teller
And tell the bitch to give the money, and hurry up

[Chorus]

[Sonsee]
To me, USG livin, is one gigantic ring of concealin
Double dealin, drug fiendin, sellin and schemin
On the next beam, fleein from the cops, caught wit beings
Illegal operatin, law violatin and death escalatin
We all need our dollars straighten, bro we can't be toleratin
Man that's frustratin, that's why we be demonstratin
How we be law breakin, cash takin, drug jugglin
Hand to hand, stand and lookout, money struck out to keep 'em strugglin
Embezzlin, extortin, man slaughter and assaultin
Mass shootin, slugs stabbin, gangs feudin and females boostin
For child supportin, or self done abortion
Everything costin, we all lustin for this fortune
So we'll still be rowdy and riotin and lookin
Every group and, until we see some more improvin
It'll be mad human deliciously, can't completion
Cuz every day is killin season

[Chorus]

[Sticky Fingaz]
I pledge allegiance to the streets and blame God for the creation
of this pitiful earth that's filled with temptation
(Birth) was my invitation, (death) will be my initiation
Now I just got off probation, so wish me congratulation
But I'm still under investigation, for psychic evaluation
Facin incarceration and isolation over some color discrimination
So I need your participation in the caucasian assassination
Time is wastin, it's a sticky situation!
Tryna stop our reproduction, to kill off our population
And it's no exaggeration, so whoever's in association
with the nigga retaliation I need your total cooperation
In hours of desperation, and for your information
A confrontation will be fought by (THE YOUNGER GENERATION!)
Cause we got determination, now all we need is organization
So I use my concentration with a Jim Crow education
(Cause) if history repeats itself your destination's the plantation
Overcomin this observation depends upon the communication
Then, without an explanation or hesitation, we have a reservation
To be limp from a tree by decoration
So, because of these altercations we need to make some alterations
Best begin with the manipulation of this whole god damn nation
Hold up it's time for my medication so it's the end of the conversation</pre>
