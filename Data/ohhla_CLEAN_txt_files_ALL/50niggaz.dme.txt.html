['Scarface' Samples]
"Okay, from here on nothing goes down unless I'm envolved.
No blackjack, no dope deals, no nothing.
A nickel bag is sold in the park, I want in.
You guys got fat while everyone sh-tarved on the street!
It's my turn." ("Turn. Turn...")
	"Think you gonna live long enough to spend that money,
	you fuckin' hump?!"
(Gunshots)
	"If any of you try to get ripped off by guys like that..."
(Gunshots)
	"You come with me, I'm in the Plaza hotel.
	You're welcome! YOU'RE ALL WELCOME!"
