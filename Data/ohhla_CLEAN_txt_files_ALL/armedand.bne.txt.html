[Intro/Hook: Layzie Bone - repeat 2X]
I got a message for them (playa haters)
Them Bone Thug niggaz (armed and we dangerous)
I got a message for them (playa, haters)
Them Bone Thug niggaz (we armed and we dangerous)

[Chorus 2X: Layzie Bone]
Why they keep smilin all up in my face when I'm here
Stabbin me in the back when I'm gone, when I'm gone
(Playa haters) When I'm gone, when I'm gone, gone
And they only come around when they need some money
Can you tell me why they want it from Bone, from Bone
(Armed and we dangerous) From Bone, from Bone, Bone

[Layzie Bone]
Got my mind on my money and my money a monopoly
Number one hits and it ain't no stoppin me
Make a couple mil', put it all in property
Strut my swag and get cocky
Fuckin get sloppy drunk and callin all y'all punks
We can take it to the streets, we can pop the trunk
I don't give a fuck, I'ma give 'em what they want
Serve a nigga like a fiend on the first of the month
'Member my motto is "No shorts, no losses"
I'ma go get it no matter what the cost is
That's how we rep cause we Cleveland bosses
Bet on the wood and nigga y'all just talkin
In the coffin if you can't get with it
From my point of view niggaz don't stick with it
A nigga like me woulda been done did it
The answer is yeah if you wanna get money 

[Chorus]

[Layzie Bone]
I'm from a place really ain't safe, Cleveland the birthplace
Midwest niggaz, yeah we stay thirsty
Timb's in the winter with the J's in the summer
All four seasons, we stay workin
Ride with a G, come and slide with a G
With the trues on the 'Llac come and ride with the beat
Light it up and let it burn when you vibin with me
Gotta keep it real to survive in the streets
Come and see it for yourself how live we can be
Milwaukee to the Chi back down to the D
Michigan, Illinois, sho' nuff killa boys
Standin on the corner at ten degrees
We got pimps, dope pushers and petty thieves
Crooked cops won't let me breathe
But my love for the city won't let me leave
What they expect from me, now why they testin me?

[Chorus]
