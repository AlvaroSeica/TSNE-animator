Tell me if you want some and you can just, come on, baby
Tell me if you want some and you can just, come on
Tell me if you want some and you can just, come on
Tell me if you want some and you can just, come on

Tell me if you just want to get closer
Ya got the numbers on ya poster
And if ya want ta, I'll make it so that
My sensual intensity captivates
Ya gotta know ya body extractuates Juice
Ectasy is what I produce
Sweetie my virtues are never ever looser
I'm not the average Joe Schmo ya used to
This Jones and ma homes gonna hurt ya
Unless ya ready for the lecture
Tell me if you just want to get closer
I wrote the numbers on ya poster
And if ya want ta, I'll make it so that
Never ever bein ..... sweat
Ya'll never climax (echo)

Tell me if you want some and you can just, come on, baby
Tell me if you want some and you can just, come on, baby

Yeah, say what you feel, feel what you say
Don't hold back, just feel that way
Take the time and the time it takes
Baby you can justify ya aint got the time to waste
Speak up, Speak up its not the time to play
You know I, I want ya in a special way (special way)
special way (special way)
special way (special way)
special way (special way)
Ya know we need to make it happen like yesterday
Ya know, get it up and runnin like flow joe
We can kick it like they do up in the dodjo
And oh, if you aint ready this can go slow
But yo, if ya with it ya can let me know so

Tell me if you want some and you can just
(OOOOOOOH)

See ya sexy girl and also quite confident
You could sell goods and probably market it
Yo wots up with seven inches can I pocket it?
I wanna get ... ? ... s'your perogative
I bet ya need a lot to gets monotomous
Spittin' more games than an evangelist
Girl you know ya scandelous
I'm tryin to get a one on one monogamous
Lets look into it like an analyist
I'm thinkin bout (?) can u handle this
Take you back to the room with just a little touch
Touchin the zone thats erogenous
But thats enough we're really tryin to chill what up?
Whats up with you? Baby we can chill or what?
Whats up? We can chill or what. Whats up with you? Baby we can chill or
what?

Tell me if you want some and you can just, come on, baby
Tell me if you want some and you can just, come on, baby
Tell me if you want some and you can just, come on, baby
Tell me if you want some and you can just, come on, baby
Come on baby (repeated until fade)</pre>
