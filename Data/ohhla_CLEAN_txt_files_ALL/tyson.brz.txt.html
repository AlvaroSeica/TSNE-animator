[ VERSE 1: Breeze ]
Take a look in the future, I'd ask who'd ya
Heard beat me - wrong, somebody fooled ya
They never riff or cause me to panic
Or make me resort to my old time antics
Refuse to lose, I'm always winnin, see, I'll
Never duck you in a battle of freestyle
So hit the highway and just truck on
Sucker duck, you're stuck on, now get the fuck on
Beat, you can't be under, so low, I'm a solo
S-o-l-o, you gotta show and prove on the strength
Cause ain't nobody hittin like Tyson, I'm goin the length
I'm The Young Son Of No One in rap
Like the man I mentioned two lines back
Never duck or weave, just believe I never run
Cause I been crowned The Young Son Of No One

(I'm not only a fighter, I'm a poet, I'm a prophet
I'm the resurrector, I'm the savior of the boxing world
If it wasn't for me the game would be dead)
(- Let me see you close your mouth and just keep it closed
- Well you know that's impossible
- No, no, no, no...)

[ VERSE 2: Breeze ]
Stop keepin me back, suckers are steadily chasin me
Controls my goal and soul is how I'm livin, see
My step is kept, so let me rule the industry
The top of hip-hop where rap is takin me
Promotional hype, yeah, that's why I wrote this
You claim I owe you this, so then promote this
Cut the sation, my talent you're wastin
Front on this, man, you must be basin
Tyson hits hard, the kid is hittin harder
I'm good at what I do, Pooh's my sparring partner
Throwin cuts, stabs, hooks, jabs, bolos
It's not many, if any, who can throw those
Tyson is a adjective to describe the kid
Admit it you can do or done what I did
My gameplan is printed, it ended in round one
Yo yo, another KO for The Young Son Of No One

(I'm young
I'm handsome
I'm fast
I'm pretty
and can't possibly be beaten)
(And can't possibly be beaten)
(It is true that I do a lot of talk 
and everything I say I mean to back it up)

[ VERSE 2: Breeze ]
T-Y-S-O-N, let the lesson begin
Killin at will and can still get fresher when
The beat is kinda hype in sweat I'm soakin in
No jokin, D, start chokin em
Every fight is a fluke, that's how I'm takin em
You might damage a dome but I'm breakin em
Just like Tyson performance is flawless
Goin the round, beatin you down, clown
The Young Son Of No One means that I'm the son of none
The fight is over before I even throw one
My attitude is rude so listen to every word up
Lose to another dude, that's undheard of
Don't call me a psycho cause I didn't bite no
Beats are not weak cause they're kinda like hype, yo
I'm back on the rise, are you surprised? 
I know you thought I'd run
From now on, call me The Young Son Of No One

(What percentage of the fans you feel will be coming)
(What percentage of the fans you feel will be coming)
(- What percentage of the fans you feel will be coming to see him
and what percentage do you feel will be coming to see you?
- Well 100% will be coming to see me
but 99% will come to see me get beaten
- Do you really feel that way?
- Because they think I talk too much)
(Because they think I talk too much)
(Because they think I talk too much)
(Because they think I talk too much)
(Because they think I talk too much)
(- I got these)
- And they represent...
- These represent dynamite
Prrr...
- There ya go)

(An unheard of thing)

(- He's young
He's handsome
- They know it!
- He's a poet, a prophet
and many people believe he'll be the next heavyweight champion of the world)
(And many people believe he'll be the next heavyweight champion of the world)
