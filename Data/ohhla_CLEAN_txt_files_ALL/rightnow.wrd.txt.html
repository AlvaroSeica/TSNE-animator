[Wordsworth Talking]
Yeah whattup world
Wordsworth you know what I'm sayin
Ain't no better time than that
Ain't no better time than the present
We gonna get into the situation for the situation
So I can talk about the situation
You know what I'm sayin Ayatollah on the beat
Let's do it

[Verse 1]
Right now you're privileged
My freestyle and phenomenal writtens
Gives y'all a conflict of interest
Whenever I star the entrance line is so far in distance
You think up ahead is a car collision
If you heard or read separately

That I smashed a celebrity's integrity
Believe it's all fact not allegedly
Murder y'all professionally no hype man next to me
That only puts him in jeopardy of bein an accessory
Can't control my conduct facin you
The radio adds to the ratio of bein confrontational
My concerts pay per view's capable of enragin you
To drive a car or truck with a bomb duck taped to you
Put you arms up got you raisin your hands
Like you confused about the rules before you take your exam
Like your left one's on the bible before takin the stand
Words is the inspiration for the creation of man

[Chorus]
Wait ladies and gentlemen glad y'all waited
Thanks but I need you attention (right now)
We finally headed in the right direction to get it
Ain't no better time than the present

[Verse 2]
Throughout the metropolitan I got a cult followin
Sore throat swallowin from sittin close hollerin
Some listeners rhyme but after they listen to mine
The list to resign looks like a petition was signed
C'mon you gotta believe my lyrics guided your seed
Put 'em in the album cover and it got 'em to read
You not in my league my flow's cold in the hottest degrees
Can seize and cause liquor in a bottle to freeze
A lotta emcee's when they see me on the streets try me
But they only claim to fame is gettin beat by me
But if you recollect and did a background check

Of my past I bet I wouldn't be at sound check
When we collaborate to my madness their's no method
I don't care if we in the same room or we wrote separate
If I'm first or third fourth or I go second
Unless I'm last the DJ won't play the whole record

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
In every class their's a clown so when I ask the crowd
Are there rappers around the whackest always has to get loud
With a pack or a pile of cats all night they hassle and hound
My crew so they can try to battle me now
So here's a comparison to narrow it down
My delivery's by air and yours travels by ground
Cause lightenin to flash thunder claps in the clouds
You can't counteract when you're under attack from the sound
Security won't tackle you down your neck I'll throw a lasso around
Hang you two feet from tappin the ground
As of (right now) Words is more anticipated
Than a patient waitin for a transplant match to be found

[Chorus]</pre>
