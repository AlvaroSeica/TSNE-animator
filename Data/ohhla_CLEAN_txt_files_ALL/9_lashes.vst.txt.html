[Vast Aire]
One three five
I'm screaming in your face but you dont hear me tho
Gun shed, Rainbow, Harlem Nights
Where's my niggas at?
Smack you in your face, you crazy?

Y'all need to leave that crack alone
Leave that crack alone
Leave that crack alone
Leave that crack alone

I can't hear you

[Verse 1]
Y'all niggas is bitch like
cant talk your way out cant even fist fight
I think you pressed your luck
you better watch yourself the lottery's up
Two more cheers then we tip the cup
we ending carrers tonight, thats whats up
Whats up Eso, yea I called you out
its only matters of time before the bitch use out
And it's only matters of time till your teeth fall out
When you ran back home you lost your clout, Gimme that
You shoulda never started shit
now your in the corner with a bandage kit
Plus I know your jelouse of Lif
thats why he bounced on y'all, y'all 'aint doing it
He got with some real cats, thats true to this
Now your all black-listed, your ruined it

Chorus x2
I'm a knock y'all down a level
Sort of like when Micheal cast down the devil
Sort of like when the earth gets reduced to a peble
Sort of like when the goverment defeats the rebel

[Verse 2]
I was there when you begged El to sign you
He knew Ox was gonna blow so he didn't sign you
Wooo, I guess the secrets out
Mommy they won't play with us, then go in the house
Play time's over, close your mouth
Do all your chores and then you go out
The closet, and I think its a walk-in
With 7L behind you and he 'aint even talking
I heared your beats on ten, they 'aint even thumping
Cry now cuase your castles crumbling
And if you heared Dirty Mag, you know they fronting
You think we care what you did eight years ago
oh you were on tour with them and so and so
Weathermen, we running this shit
Likliest one in the chamber and you running your shit
What the fuck

Chorus x3
