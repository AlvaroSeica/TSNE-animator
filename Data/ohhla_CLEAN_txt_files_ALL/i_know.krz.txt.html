(*talking*)
See you looking at me like that, you know what's happ'ning
Um I guess we came here to talk huh, it's cool
Hotel waste of time, it's cool

[Hook - 2x]
I know my niggaz, wanna thug with me
Half of my hoes, leave the club with me
Off in my Navi, making love to me
Look what this No Limit shit done to me

[Krazy]
I enlisting my bitches, like I'm joining the army
Keep my chopper on the seat, so these cowards can't hard me
I'm known for mixing Hennessy, nigga with weed
So much smoke in the air, I can barely breathe
My seed, is bound to be a fucking soldier too
I'm a motherfucking thug, I don't know about you
Slanging rocks on the block, ever since a teen
Me and my little brother Sam, tote a mini 14
Hustling till the day break, nigga what's happ'ning
Till I finally figured out, they got more money in rapping
Now them bitches on my dick, everywhere that I go
If I really think about it, I'd probably fuck your hoe why

[Hook - 2x]

[Krazy]
I got a attitude homie, like my dog T. Harris
If these bitch niggaz fuck with me, they know they get buried
See these bitch niggaz hating, while I'm thugging in public
I ain't mad, cause my motherfucking hoes they love it
Every time, a nigga open up his mouth
Ain't nothing, but that thug shit come out
You best believe I'm a hustler, ask my niggaz
It gon' take more than bait, one to count my figgas
I been worth a mill nigga, ever since the projects
Ask my dogs in the hood, with my old tape in the deck
Now I throw my own parties, for the rich and the po'
Without a breeder tattoo, don't even come to the do' you know why

[Hook - 2x]

[Krazy]
Grab that wall, back that up - 7x
And after you finished with all that, you know what's up
