[Bliss]
With continuous ease
How words form leaves, indiciduous trees
And they fall in slow motion down past Old Kent and Whitechappel
All the way to parks, lanes and feelings in me
I dare to say some even nudge up against your nephews left shoe
I watch him fetch too, it whispers and sketches of blue trees with green sheets
Now who believes dreams sleep
What seemed bleak becomes noticeable
It gleams deep so we can cope when we're done
And these are my watchdog water dragons

[Verse 1: Bliss]
And I guess that I'm just a jar drifting by the tide
And I hope that a star will lift me to reside
In the hands of a single soul that can relate
to these crawlings, my fingers cold, still relate
By the force, that draws the cogs in my clock work
That lights my way through the fog in the hot dirt
In your youth you're just blowing in the wind
And ya see the truth and they throw you in a spin
of this vicious cycle it wont clean the stain
And I think it's vital I dont seem the same
When I look in the mirror see the long hall bound
When I'm stumbling, crumbling and it all falls down
Like do ya feel the rythym and like
Will ya still be livin a lie
Will ya kneel and listen to yourself
The only person that can peel the prison walls away
They all fall to dust
And ya'll are saying we can call it trust
And if we call it trust then now all of us
can get down together and live tall and just
Cos I never plucked an eyelash out, I only wished it goodbye
I said I never plucked an eyelash out, I only wished this could fly
into books, poems, stars bloom and movies
Theme park themes, dark cartoons of scoobie
It sooths me, its all the same dont confuse it
Bored to video games, create the music
Just use it
Children, thank you very much
I'm aware that you're building a sanctuary up
Cause reality creates the sadness
We rely on these things to escape the madness
Like doin those "that I can tell by your stare"
I'll come around and said we're both aware
My first tv murder the night in anti-poor
My hole into a closet of 1984
But when I wrote something lovely with my ink
I stopped being humpty dumpty on the brink
of losing my balance I found it shit
It was a point man
The feeling I get when im alone but we join hands
Chilling out but I'm bound by a necklace
I dont know but I get a little reckless
And if I dont make it to the end of the road
I dont even know the weight that I will unload
I wish I could relapse another time
Turn back the tap discovered rhymes
Back and forth, forth and back
Ya'll pulled me in but that cord went slack

[Chorus: Eso] {X2}
Just me in my room writing rhymes
To listen when you barbeque outside or
In doors jam packed in the club
Goin' 60 in your car you can feel it in your blood

[Verse 2: Eso]
Lets build a world of our own so start to gather rocks
The shire's known chatterbox
To build a home for un-fartherd kids
And guide the population across the harbour bridge
The harvest is controlling my Watchdog Water Dragons
I'll never stop writing thats just a great author's passion
to write a million books and not look back at one of them
And to notice when the children look
There's something that the buildings took
From their natural purpose
And in a state like this I can never be nervous
This is my house, my crib, my kingdom
Where the floor-boards creek and the kids keep singing
We live each season just to give beats reason
Step into my house, all kids leave dreamin'
Vanilla sky walking with a halo and some cannabis
My t-shirt reads "minoritys in managment"
And yeh thats right I'll die for this habitat
Fly young poet, fly and bring the majic back
This nest is home, home is nest
I wanna rest my dome, I wanna hold your breast
And if the world would give me a chance and I could witre on by
and fly just like a kite in the sky
See this matchstick, signifies my love
It wont burn out it will only rise above
What a view from here, we survived the flood
Too many blind and deaf to hear the cries of doves
anymore cos the parks been crushed by the buildings
And the view has been replaced by a ceiling
Plus the carpark was a paradise underneath
that ground won't be free to breathe
So I ride on a dragon and my couch is a tiger
to stop the towns flooding and the houses on fire
But no that's not true reality's a bitch
Stuck in a catagory where your salary is shit
So, capture my love whenever you feel it
They say thats just mud, he doesn't have feelings
Well I do and its true, I cover the canvis
Me and strawberry fields looking for answers
All I wanted was a mansion for my mother
Phat houses all around the world for my brothers
*Flowers in the pavement*, a world that sings
Studios in every basement and girls with wings

[Chorus: Eso] {X4}
Me in my room writing rhymes
To listen when you barbeque outside or
In doors jam packed in the club
Goin' 60 in your car you can feel it in your blood</pre>
