Real nigga

(C-Murder)
Real motherfuckin nigga

(C-Murder - in background)

Chorus (2x):
Real niggas and we ride on them bustas
We some real niggas scream fuck them motherfuckers

(C-Murder)
I smoke weed, when my mind gone, I aint tripping
Bullets flipping, young nigga bout that hollow chipping
Fliping Ki's on the block, where them G's at
Got them hoes sucking my dick till they knees crack
Drop top 6 all black with the black tints
I got them niggas pushing crack like a Mack 10
A dollar short and I'm coming
bout to have these fools running
Hundred rounds humming, bout to break em off something
Call my cousin Rock on the Mobile phone, he at home
Magnolia projects, straight from Clebourne
In the city, where the shitty niggas quick to give you
A ticket to the morgue (nigga) after they kill you
Fuck the penn, cause if I go again, I'm a rider
You never catch me slipping, I got my heater right beside, uh
Running from the cops, cause the law, I don't trust ya

You know them niggas that say they ain't scared to die
