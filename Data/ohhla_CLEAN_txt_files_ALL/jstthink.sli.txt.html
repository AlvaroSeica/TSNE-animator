Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Ya know that lovin' ain't enough to make the world go round
You know that lovin' ain't enough to make the world renowned
It's just enough to make you move and want to feel the ground
When you're down and you're out and you know
Because we're holding on to lovin'
The type of feeling that make you want to implode
Or like a time bomb ticking explode
Or it's a feeling that you wanted to know
About the world how does it know
Because we're holding on to lovin'
Because we're holding on to lovin'
Yeaah

Yeah ayeeh
Using caution when I'm approaching
Got to obtain perfection
Using art to act as a cushion
Which measures my main obsession
My inner direction came into possession
Dressed as positive vibes
There is never a question I feel like I'm blessed
To just be part of the ride
The feeling is hard to describe
Call it the faith or call it the drive
No matter the space or the size
This magic will happen in front of your eyes
And whether you're dead or alive
Late or way ahead of your time
You do possess the power to change
The negative forces that enter your mind
See love is a seed as soon as it leaves
You feel the emotion and passion
Somebody can feel when something is real
And not just a little bit caption
We live in a primitive fashion
Logic is distant we give in to passion
So we can get lost and thrown off course
And keep it from preventing from crashing
I know what your asking
What if the world was undermined is it worth this?
Can it be reached if I can dig deeper
Or am I just scratching the surface?
Well I was just thinking of ways
Of singing the meaning and making the phrase
Because trying to personify love
Is harder than writing with ink on a page</pre>
