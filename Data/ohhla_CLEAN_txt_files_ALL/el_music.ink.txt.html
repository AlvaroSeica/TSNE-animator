Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
I know we ain't really spoke well
But it's a private party later at my hotel room
You should come by a little later
If you down girl meet me at the elevator
Then we going up
Going up, going up, going up
Going up, going up
Then we going up
Going up, going up, going up
Going up, going up

[Verse 1]
Going up but I wanna lay you down like no trust
Your body so fire might erupt
It's a long way to the top so you can't rush love
Just tell me that it's lust,
And we can start right here on the elevator
Let me get you high, get you elevated
Penthouse, X-rated
Let's unwind, we are running out of time girl

[Chorus]
I know we ain't really spoke well,
But it's a private party later at my hotel room
You should come by a little later,
If you down girl meet me at the elevator
Then we going up
Going up, going up, going up
Going up, going up
Then we going up
Going up, going up, going up
Going up, going up

[Verse 2]
Going, going right into the o-zone
With yo friends you should tell 'em so long
Just met, feels like I waited so long
Duet, I ain't trying to leave solo
Forget about yo ex
Meet me at the elevator, leave him at the steps
And I'm a work you out,
But in a couple reps we up all night
Baby, we don't need a rest

[Chorus]
I know we ain't really spoke well,
But it's a private party later at my hotel room
You should come by a little later,
If you down girl meet me at the elevator
Then we going up
Going up, going up, going up
Going up, going up
Then we going up
Going up, going up, going up
Going up, going up</pre>
