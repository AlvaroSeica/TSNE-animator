Song:   On Top
Typed by: Lil Hustle

(*talking*)
Southside for sho, Presidential C.M.G.
The Don Lil' Ke, Po-Yo check it

[Chorus - 2x]
We on top now, and it's still all good
From my block to your block, let's do it for the hood
On top now, and I'm loving the streets
It's c.d.'s microphones, and some tight ass beats

[Lil' Keke]
We on the blocks nonstop, hustling with twin glocks
Got them chickens in the pot, for 17 a whop
And it's Presidential, connecting with C.M.G.
All good in the hood, down in 7-1-3
They call me Don Ke, I grab the microphone and work it
S.U.C. nigga, and the click closed circuit
Jet for the cash, gotta have my shit straight
Southside G's, another Bad Azz Mixtape
Ride with me, on this spending spree
In the studio cooking, on the MP3
Like a true O.G., yeah one of a kind
If the chick in the Benz, best believe she a dime
On the grind (on the grind), stressing ten a show
H-Town on fire, got the place like whoa
And it's been Texas, since the day that I dropped
And from my block to your block, we still on top yeah

[Chorus - 2x]

[Big Pokey]
My block to your block, nigga it's all good
When my pen touch the sheet let's eat, it' understood
We country, we keep our horses under the hood
Hugging corners on these backstreets, Stone to the Wood
I'm that dog in the yard, that's tied up to the hooptie
When I lock, the only to unlock me is shoot me
They fucked my nigga Kobe, that bitch was a groupie
I be damned, if I let a bitch suck me and sue me
Come to my room, I'ma strip her till she fumble the ball
She was with it, cause I woke up with her tongue in my draws
I want a cut like a dog, dog I'm loving the streets
I treat a track like raw meat, I smother the beat
I'm so fly I need to be in the trees, I'm on fire
Like a coke connect, niggaz wanna be my decrees
Fuck moving cheese, I got trees and c.d.'s
And venues, dropping five G's to see me

[Chorus - 2x]

[Mussilini]
Now them plaques, on the wall mayn
We leave the ig'nance in the highway, y'all play
We bout to send this boat y'all way, or park it in your driveway
And feeling that it's my day, and yes the sun's been shining
24-7 grinding, watching hate and a miss
It's always a snook, trying to divide the fish
Don't collide with this, this train is packing
Got Skinny and D-Black, and hell-a-cop smacking
Presidential affiliation, coast to coast we consuming em
All around the world, they tal'n bout what we gon' do with em
Them boys off the chain, out the Clarke off the Main
Keep our name off your throat, watch your mouth watch your brain
Gotta feel us closer, wanna run in a corner
Your bag of tricks, can't box Jehovah
Your ending is finished, the scrimmage we win it
You niggaz is bitches, and watch us fall all over you niggaz

[Chorus - 2x]</pre>
