[Verse 1]
Yeah, pocket full of boarding passes
Huh, I don't know what city I was in last
But I'm out here trying to make an impact
Same time keep myself intact
Say, take it, take it easy A like it's gym class
Tell me how I could? there's slaves in world
Before I die I'm trying to see us end that
So I move fast, Ramadan
Ugh, most fast, autobahn
Who cares if I ever get a grammy nom
If my soul takes L's, phenomenon
Still can't believe I get paid for this
As a kid all I did was pray for this
Now I'm living out my dream, craziest
Got me really feeling like I was made for this!
At the same time never knew how dangerous
It could be when lives start getting changed to this
When somebody say you they favorite
Guess it carry some weight to it
You know, cuz ugh
That's power and that's influence, the temptation is
To use it for myself and serve somebody else
I'm sitting here buggin just rememberin
What them rappers showed me, ugh
How to bag a honey, stack the money
They said I was mac by the number of shorties that I could smash
Now I'm waiting on that matrimony
Cuz, I've been changed up, lil homie came up
It's depressing, kicking with dudes I used to look up to
They still on that same stuff
I ain't have no role models, now I gotta be one
I bought the lie hiphop sold me, man I want a refund..

[Chorus]
I feel like it's the real me
Feel me?
Yeah, I been changed
But I'm still me
What I am now
Not what I will be
I'm trying to give life
But this could be the death of me
Oh
The death of me
This could be the death of me
Oh
(just trying to give life, what I do for a living could kill me)
Yeah-yeah-yeah
The death of me
This could be the death of me
(just trying to give life, what I do for a living could kill me)
Yeah-yeah-yeah

[Verse 2]
Look, mama feel like she losing me
To this lifestyle that's consuming me
I travel every weekend
Even when I'm weak, man
You know what that to do to me
Huh?
Back pain, back pain
Sleeping on planes and feeling like Bruce Wayne
Blackout all night on that stage
Man, I need a batcave just to get away
Uhh
Jesus retreated to speak with his Father
I know that I need it
My career been growing
But tell me where I'm going if my time with God is depleted
(Nowhere)
God, I'm sorry, I mean it
All I want to do is walk with you but
My priorities wrong, I talk about you more than I talk with you
Uhh
One of my mentors taught me
Whenever things get foggy
If you wanna grow in God
It's not complicated
It just costy
Gotta spend that time, currency
Uhh, overtime gets to learn to be
Uhh, strong enough to admit I'm weak
To meet with God I'll need his needs
Yeah, 2014 bout' to be different
I think my favorite word will be no
Opportunities come and they go, but
None of them is worth my soul
That's somethin' that you can't afford, and
Got me thinking what's most important
Uhh, I get kicks watching grown men in line for some Jordans
Nowadays, time is fortune, but chasing fortune is all consuming
I feel like God is calling dudes
They just wanna play Call of Duty
This that Peter Pan
At the dinner table out in Never Land
Eating, can't nobody see it but me and my boys
That's the way I wanna keep it
Huh
Aye, I lost a couple friends to this new season
Jealousy and hate for a few reasons
Used to be down, now whassup?
Guess everybody around when the fun's up
Yeah
Got me feeling like CÃ©li DÃ©
Women wanna holla, I just tell em' that I'm taken
Even if I wasn't I'd be slow for the taking
I don't if they love me or the money I'm making
(I don't know!)
Ain't no way to really tell
Where somebody heart truly at
Bad girls coming at me looking good
Showing off they body, that's a booby trap
Been low, but I never let my guard down
Huh?
Buddy, I ain't crazy
You ain't bout' to catch me slipping
Put a million dollar baby!
(No sir!)
Me and Dre trying to eat good
Cutting out the nonsense
On the road trying to give life
Huh?
But, I might lose mine in the process
I ain't have no role models, now I gotta be one
I bought the lie hip-hop sold me, man I want a refund..

[Chorus]
I feel like it's the real me
Feel me?
Yeah, I been changed
But I'm still me
What I am now
Not what I will be
I'm trying to give life
But this could be the death of me
Oh
The death of me
This could be the death of me
Oh
(just trying to give life, what I do for a living could kill me)
Yeah-yeah-yeah
The death of me
This could be the death of me
(just trying to give life, what I do for a living could kill me)
Yeah-yeah-yeah</pre>
