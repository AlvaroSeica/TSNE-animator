[Verse 1]
Some girls say I'm the cutest, others say I'm the rudest
Meditate like a Buddhist expose em like a nudist
I'm Jesus, they Judaist, my diamonds the bluest
Got the answers, they clueless, Ashanti foolish

I with a stewardess, mami say flight attendant
Called her a stupid bitch, sorry nah I might have meant it
See I'm type demented, 4 mil I might have meant it
But I got It back right back, yeah yeah my life is splendid

Me and mommy drinking, drinking to the point she hurls
I'm bout to swirl the world world, want to join me girl
The cloths from Italy, the coat from Sicily
I'm talking literally, c'mon now stop kidding me

I don't kid at all, I get it all, get rid of it all
Come and stay with me, where I live, the mall
Banker banker, dealership, and the rim shop
You know him slim, before mims I been hot

[Chorus]
Baby come and play and lay and
stay with me girlfriend I'll change your life
Spend the night with me, we'll talk and
chill and watch TV she said "sure you're right"

[Verse 2]
Miami, islan to Brisco, I get it cooking like Crisco
From Chi town back to Frisco, my diamonds like the disco
Mami what the hell you like, you know what the hell I like
A hood bitch, stretch marks, beaty beat, cellulite

Baby we need eachother, don't want to meet your mother
My mouth is like the sewer, yeah yeah I keep it gutter
I sell hot peas and butter, don't want to see you suffer
A nigga like me, wont meet another, you clogged up I'll be your plumber

Sorta like draino, you know how the game goes
Different color cars, I garages a rainbow
ima a leprechaun, but I sell methadone
marijuana, heroine, till you run a marathon

My hood like Lebanon, but that's its benaton
You up in something fly, I got my weapon on
We get our chiefin on, chiefin on everyday
I got the cookie cutter, mami's the pepper spray

[Chorus]

[Girl chorus]
Come kiss it, Come kiss it
Come kiss it, Come kiss it
Come kiss it, Come kiss it
Come kiss it, Come kiss it

Come get it, Come get it
Come get it, Come get it
Come get it, Come get it
Come get it, Come get it

[Verse 3]
Lets get this guacamole, you feeling hot then hold me
You had your guard up at first like a soccer goalie
If I got it you get it, baby I get it you got it
Lets hit the pacific, terrific, I'm feeling melodic

Cuz you looking exotic, now you getting erotic
Like you straight from the tropics want to shoot it and cock it
Not the glamour baby girl, I'm talking something else
All she do is look and say cam you something else

Listen love I ain't the one to get lovey dovey
But you looking good you ever need a hubby love free
You got to love me shots of bubbly
Get your mouth wet, you the outlet, I got the plug

[Chorus]

[Girl chorus]
Come kiss it, Come kiss it
Come kiss it, Come kiss it
Come kiss it, Come kiss it
Come kiss it, Come kiss it

Come get it, Come get it
Come get it, Come get it
Come get it, Come get it
Come get it, Come get it</pre>
