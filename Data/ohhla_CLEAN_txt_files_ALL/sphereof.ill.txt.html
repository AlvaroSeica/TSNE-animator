[Verse 1]
It's there and it's here, it's far and it's near
All my hopes and all my fears are manifested in the sphere
It's distorted but it's clear, it's my enemy and my peer
It's as wack as radio rap and it's doper than Premier
It's all of what you see and it's all of what you hear
It's Def Jams, it's So So Def, it's On Def Ears
It makes you cheer and lets you chill, it saves and it kills
It's unbelievably creative and it's run of the mill
It's fake and it's real, it's politics and it's skills
It takes up all my money, but it pays all of my bills
Still it's simple to decipher and difficult to discern
It's hip-hop, it's paid in full, it's hard to earn
It's you must learn and I got it made, it's who's the man
It's brothers gotta work it out, it's parents just don't understand
It's overblown and underhanded, Pacific to Atlantic
Watching all your dreams get shattered and all your wishes granted
Where ignorance runs rampant and knowledge reigns supreme
Where loyalty's highly regarded but everybody switches teams
It's closet aficionados and It's microphone fiends
It's where we say what we mean by any means for Elohim
It's all that you despise and everything that you hold dear
It's war and peace, it's this and that, it's hip-hop and it's the sphere
It's all that you despise and everything that you hold dear
Yin and Yang, it's love and hate, it's hip-hop and it's the sphere

[Verse 2]
It's up and it's down, It's free and it's bound
It's sight and it's sound, it's mainstream, it's underground
Profound and common sense, it's past and present tense
It's dollars, it's cents it's guilt it's innocence
It's bent and it's sober, it's on my mind and on my shoulders
It's the Bronx, it's Queensbridge, I forgot, the bridge is over
It's New York, Los Angeles, Atlanta, Minnesota
It's hip-hop, it's even freaking North and South Dakota
It's contained within my headphones but still it blows my speakers
It's big willie wannabes and it's Poor Righteous Teachers
It's living for the moment and it's dying over nothing
It's we're all in the same gang and it's headed for self destruction
It's tougher than leather, it's no one can do it better
It's ripping a freestyle and it's your writtens to the letter
It's a sling and a stone and it's fully automatic
It's the sphere of hip-hop, peace to Plastic</pre>
