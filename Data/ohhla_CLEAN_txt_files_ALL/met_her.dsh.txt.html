this for all the ladies man, yeah
for all the bitches
baby girl was real bad tho man
she had ya boy like whoooo
bottles of liquor man
look how we did it tho
check game

I met her last week
baby was a superbad freak
callin me late night, she can't sleep
tellin me her feelings run deep
she in the bath tub wants me to come see (like that)
she say she love a nigga company
and don't nobody beat it up like me (nobody)
I'm like Bruce Lee when I'm in a coochie
jabbin, stabbin, lettin her seduce me (yeah)
she wants me to have the key
I just met the girl recently (I just met her)
we was at the mall I was sellin her a cd
she gave me her number in a hurry
I told her I'ma call don't worry
I was like Eddy Murphy
I had the hutch laughin (hahaha)
then she walked away all I thought about was passion (damn)
she was laced in the latest fashion
with no panty line, so I could only imagine
was about to happen, when I hit those
it's a trip I just met her about a week ago
I really didn't know what the outcome would be
but everytime we contact it was so lovely
she didn't put nothing above me
after havin sex she would backrub me
she let a thug be how a nigga wanna be
but I got my guards up I'm not a rookie
I be goin hard killin on her pussy
she be sayin don't fill me like Missy</pre>
