Lights camera action
She don't ration
Her walks passion
Guaranteed satisfaction
Not a fraction
Sees men when they passing
all glancing
chance is they'll try but she'll have the last laughin'
hahahahaha
perfume scented
hearts get dented
for sale rarely rented
the lease is your lifespan
then she gets stepping
for you she does the reppin
only if you keep her draped in
the finest dressing
the spark in her iris
she told me she's the finest
warners must liars
she's too desirous
i'll kill any admirers
and do whatever it requires

Chorus:
Most men try most men fall
Many men died fighting for her reward
Dunya dunya
What she tryina do to me
Dunya Dunya
Why she tryna ruin me

Verse 2:
Now she opened up her passage
I'm a magnet to her body fragments
Fine shiny fabrics
Shook off maggots
Yeah my style savage
No one shares son's palace
my Heart flames chalice
I become an addict
Iced her out wit carrots
Multi colored parrots
Plush trips paris
Raised Glass lavish
Yeah she gets spoil
I thought she'd be loyal
'till I got the call
How could she
Out eyeing up another
Seeing he got more
She walked out closed the door left me raw cold under
she said I do whatever's necessary
to keep gold in my belly
should have her buried
but she protected already
disillusioned
Promised me a smile
But she fused it with illusion
So what's the solution
Love towards a thing can blind and deafen one
Most men try most men fall
Many men died fighting for her reward

Dunya dunya
What she tryina do to me
Dunya Dunya
Why she tryna ruin me</pre>
