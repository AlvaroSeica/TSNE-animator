Tweet baby,Tweet baby
(Esham) N-A-T-A-S Will never die forever I fly
U-n-h-o-l-y sing another wicket lullaby
When I kick it bitches know they bite it, want to murder my
Style's been terror in the aisles don't question why
Thunder falls from the sky when the demons cry
Suicidal when I bust the demonic recital
I main murder your idol,Mc. homocidal
Finished him off and flew away with your title
I think you best be going and read your Holy Bible
Before you get bloody from my shotgun rifle
(Mastamind) Now you see me, now you don't
Never could be touched, hit you with the football with the rush
Silence of your ass make you all hush
You gotta brawl with us to stall us, we call y'all bluff
(bitch) I'm the man, king of the land
I feel the wind and the rain and the lightning from my hand
Join the odyssey, deep as the goddess of the sea
Natas, probably the gods of the streets                                       

N-A-T-A-S will never die, 
forever I fly
Masta M-i-n-d sing another wicket lullabye
When I kick it bitches know they bite want to murder my
Styles been terror in the aisles don't question why

(T-N-T) My AK shots bust loud at night
I run up on the stage and I'm grabbing the mic
I be the one that bust your dome with the chrome until your g's all roam
Like your cell phone burning up your ozone
The microphone, prone to get blown, for real it's on
I rock a stadium, a dome
My advice to you is don't play me when alone
Cause N-A-T-A-S will never die and this is known

N-A-T-A-S will never die, forever I fly
They tell me T-N-T kick another wicket lullabye
When I kick it bitches know they bite it want to murder my
Styles been terror in the aisles don't question 
why why why why why why why why</pre>
