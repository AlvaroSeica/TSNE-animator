(Juicy J)
Aye, we got any weed..?
We got any weed rolled up in there?
Aight, pass me that blunt mane

(Hook, Juicy J)
If I ain't in the Phantom, I'm prolly in a tank
Catch me overseas; Flock of bitches blowin dank
I'm where you ain't; I'm coppin err'thang that you can't
Get yo pockets up; Big-bank-take-lil-bank
Big-bank-take-lil-bank
Big-bank-take-lil-bank
I'm on a spree fuckin bitches; Big-bank-take-lil-bank
Big-bank-take-lil-bank
Big-bank-take-lil-bank
I'm with a movie star, trippy; Big-bank-take-lil-bank

(Verse 1, Juicy J)
Forever gon' ball and I'm tellin you, dawg
If I'm not in the lab; Then I'm fuckin up the mall
At the car lot; Fuck swappin out
I loved err'thang there; So I had to buy 'em out
Ridin round the city; They know it's me
Parera hangin out the window; Hard not to notice me
Big bands; My combo
Need all that; Like pronto
Get money with my eyes closed
Got a condo with a lotta ho's!
My ice is a like a freezer; Evil Knievel
Shots of bomb diesel; Doin somethin illegal
Love makin money and I do it for the people
Ball on 'em once; Now here go the sequel

(Hook, Juicy J)
If I ain't in the Phantom, I'm prolly in a tank
Catch me overseas; Flock of bitches blowin dank
I'm where you ain't; I'm coppin err'thang that you can't
Get yo pockets up; Big-bank-take-lil-bank
Big-bank-take-lil-bank
Big-bank-take-lil-bank
I'm on a spree fuckin bitches; Big-bank-take-lil-bank
Big-bank-take-lil-bank
Big-bank-take-lil-bank
I'm with a movie star, trippy; Big-bank-take-lil-bank

(Verse 2, Key)
Try to make 'em understand (Yeah, ho)
Gotta make 'em understand (Yeah, ho)
I said that "Money ain't a Thang" (Yeah, ho)
I ride around in them Prada frames (Yeah, ho)
I ride around and I ticket dames (Yeah, ho)
Since he got money; Ain't been the same (Yeah, ho)
My denim cost and they denim plain (Yeah, ho)
While you coppin halfs, we got ten of them thangs (Yeah, ho)
Duffle bag like it's in dismay (Yeah, ho)
Deep off in your girls head; I'm prayin God for my sinnin ass
Thank you Jesus; Like A-men
A-million; A-million
Flippin bitches at the Days Inn
That Cali Kush is so amazin
That kick stand; I'm so faded
My lighter lit; My blunt blazin
I'm comin down and them niggas hatin
Gotta go and get it; Our money crazy
Go and get it; Our money crazy
Big banks and it's takin lil banks
And I'm prolly at your girl house; Twistin up and blowin staaaank

(Hook, Juicy J)
If I ain't in the Phantom, I'm prolly in a tank
Catch me overseas; Flock of bitches blowin dank
I'm where you ain't; I'm coppin err'thang that you can't
Get yo pockets up; Big-bank-take-lil-bank
Big-bank-take-lil-bank
Big-bank-take-lil-bank
I'm on a spree fuckin bitches; Big-bank-take-lil-bank
Big-bank-take-lil-bank
Big-bank-take-lil-bank
I'm with a movie star, trippy; Big-bank-take-lil-bank</pre>
