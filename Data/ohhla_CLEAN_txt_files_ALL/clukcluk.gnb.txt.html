[G talking]
Excuse me
I got an announcement to make
Yo, if you ain't never been to Hempstead
Then welcome, where chickens cluck cluck day and night
G&amp;B

[G]
I see these chickens getting bizzy all up in my cage
I'm about to pluck two weeks
I'm up in my pay
Cluck, cluck, bodies rocking all up in my crib
Anybody want to know, the party's still sick
Somebodies knocking, knocking, knocking at my door
The same chick that you slept with
She played my minutes coming home from my bed
She said after tonight she got to be with the kids
The kids, the kids, the kids, kids, kids
I don't want to cause you compications
I just want one night of satisfaction
After tomarrow we can act like nothing happened
Take this invitation
With the metro card at the train station

[Chorus]
She said I do I, do I, do I what
She said I do, I do cluck, cluck
She said I do, I do, I do I what
She said I do, I do cluck cluck

[B]
I'm about to pluck two weeks
I'm up in my pay
Cluck, cluck, bodies rocking all up in my crib
Anybody want to know, the party's still sick
Somebodies knocking, knocking, knocking at my door
The same chick that you slept with
She played my minutes coming home from my bed
She said after tonight she got to be with the kids
The kids, the kids, the kids, kids, kids
I don't want to force you to stay If you don't want to stay
I just want to thank you girl for making my day
But just in case you change your mind
I got a kingsize bed with a bottle of wine
I'm bad for really, because I knew she was comin
And I didn't want to waste my time

[Chorus]
She said I do I, do I, do I what
She said I do, I do cluck, cluck
She said I do, I do, I do I what
She said I do, I do cluck cluck

[Wyclef Jean]
Yo it's the innovator
In twenty years I'll be among the greats
Came in grimy
Now all my dogs are telling me
So all the cluckers want to know if I'm going to front them
When I flip out and turn into the werewolf of London
You all can't get no money even if you gave me money
You dig?
It's the iceberg slim philosophy
Wyclef, G&amp;B up in your area
So many chickens fighting
It looks like riots in Africa

[G]
I see these chickens getting bizzy all up in my cage
I'm about to pluck two weeks
I'm up in my pay
Cluck, cluck, bodies rocking all up in my crib
Anybody want to know, the party's still sick
Somebodies knocking, knocking, knocking at my door
The same chick that you slept with
She played my minutes coming home from my bed
She said after tonight she got to be with the kids
I see these chickens getting bizzy all up in my cage
I'm about to pluck two weeks
I'm up in my pay
Cluck, cluck, bodies rocking all up in my crib
Anybody want to know, the party's still sick
Somebodies knocking, knocking, knocking at my door
The same chick that you slept with
She played my minutes coming home from my bed
She said after tonight she got to be with the kids
The kids, the kids, the kids, kids, kids

[B talking]
Yo, I told you
Official jump off
Yo, Deaf Records

[Wyclef talking]
Wyclef check you up in the morning
Come on and come on

(Chorus fades)</pre>
