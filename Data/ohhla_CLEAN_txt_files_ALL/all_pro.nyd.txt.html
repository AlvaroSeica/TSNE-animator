5-7-75 my born day 
I reach earth, now i'm involved in foul play 
Ty Nitty 
New York City 
we stay right 
the high life 
flooded ice from jewel heist 
the Infamous Mobb with hood-like sense 
get up on a nigga quick 
hit 'em up with the ice pick 
strike quick 
leave ya body froze, sub-zero 
was taught to fear no 
so I do so 
be All Pro 
flow international, rational 
matter of fact, i'm blastin' you 
with the loaded weapon 
no question 
first suggestion 
pack ya shit, and head Western 
relocation 
new state, new destination 
re-arrange your life 
on the run from vice 
make you pray to Christ 
kid fucked up 
my Mobb is rough 
nigga, what! 
[Twin] 
We true to be 
snake niggas for eternity 
Mobb family 
murder thee 
if it's meant to be 
trife casualty 
got the whole world after me 
catastrophe among us, fatal tragedy 
Mafiosa, murder one mind 
black toaster, low composure 
twin Glocks in 2 holsters 
we mobb vultures 
watch the fleet come closer 
we tap down 
nowhere to run now 
don't back down 
muffled out my 4-pound 
silent sound 
bodies bloody on the ground 
chest full of 12 4-pound rounds 
nigga lay down, kid you assed out now 
[Havoc] 
no doubt, the infamous reppin' up in this 
know what i'm sayin' 
next up 
[Prodigy] 
yeah yeah whatever kid, whatever kid 
yo, yo, the chronicles of a criminal cat who hold gat 
and bust back at trash ass cats who scratch 
leave big holes like bitches with they legs spread hot 
ready for action now peep my whole block 
unveiled, and reveal hazardous skill 
trained assassins of this rap danger field 
I feel y'all niggas ain't really keepin' it real 
use that ice grill like a shield 
nigga you meal, for my vultures 
swoop down attack your corpse 
and found layin' in the streets of New York 
now sleepwalk 
for that shit you did, shoulda never had did 
now you boxed in 
sentenced to a lifetime bid 
nigga Noyd and Pee, shine light like jewelry 
silver and gold exclusively 
terrorize and multiplee 
shot up your spot up 
it just ain't what you used to be 
after these fists of NY struck you D 
Now you see a whole new life and new leaf 
searchin' for an exit tryin' to retreat the street 
wavin' white flags no days, you dead meat 
we only truce when your heartbeat cease, peace 
[Big Noyd] 
Now who dare swear they can step up on these premises 
protected by a bunch of menaces 
Rapper Noyd, the soloist 
4-pound controloist 
comin' out the infamous controllin' the shit 
pistol packin' Pee on the side of me 
leap if you think sweet 
shit's deep, infamously 
now check the family 
Prodigy, H-A-V-O-C, Ty Nitty, Godfather pt. 3, Gambino, Face, and
Gotti 
so don't try me 
or better yet don't try this 
my click specialty is vulturin' 
trained endangerin' 
packin' pipe games 
them heavy metal thing things 
ain't nuthin' changed 
Karate Joe, Money No, make 'em fold 
gather up them hoes 
take 'em to the mo 
keep it on the low 
you know the steelo, immediately 
the VSOP is mandatory 
it's all about hoes and clothes 
the same story 
stackin' cheddar, packin' Berettas, keepin' it real 
fuck the sentimental feel 
the Mobb movin' shit in reseal 
swiftly, smooth and quickly 
the million dollar operation ran by the Mobb foundation 
the nine pound we had it locked down 
kept 'em shook 
nine double trey's off da hook 
the Mobb became famous from the lives that we took 
doin' jooks 
so peep how the 4-pound sound it's off the motherfuckin' hook 
shit is real, plus exclusive and grimy 
Rapper Noyd takin' over with the Mobb behind me 
nigga what. </pre>
