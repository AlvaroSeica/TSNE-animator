Come to Butt-head (come closer to my love..)
(Come to my love!) Come a little closer
(come closer to my love..) Let me, touch you
(Let me touch you) That would be cool
(Let me feel you) Let me feel you near me
(so near me)

[Beavis]
Heheheheh, YEAH, let me FEEL YOU

[Butt-head]
I would like, do something that really sucks, for your love
Hhuh.. I would like, do homework and stuff (B: wussy!) for your love
(come to my love..)
Come to Butt-head (come closer to my love..)
(Come to my love!) Come a little closer
(closer)

[Positive K]
Nah-na-nah-now Butt-head ah-ah-I-I-don't know
I don't know man I don't know

[Butt-head]
So like, Positive

[Positive K]
Now I don't mean to interrupt the song
I feel you're goin about this whole thing kinda wrong
First you gotta stop bein so mischievous
or you might find your girl doin the butt-up with your man Beavis

[Beavis]
Heheh yeah, heh yeah, she's gonna do the butt with me!
(B: No way Beavis!) Heheh yeah mhmm heh this is gonna be cool hehe

[Positive K]
I really don't think that's somethin you wanna see

[Butt-head]
Uhhh.. huhhuhhh, no way!
(come to my love..)
Come to Butt-head (come closer to my love..)
(Come to my love!) Come a little closer
(come closer to my love..)

[Beavis]
Meheheh yeah yeah eheh closer!

[Positive K]
See you gotta be a Don, and turn em on
like Orville Redenbacher I keep em poppin baby take em shoppin

[Butt-head]
Shopping sucks!
Hey Positive; I thought you got chicks cause you were cool

[Positive K]
Oh!  Please dude, you can't believe it's true
but I wasn't referrin to me, cause I was talkin bout you

[Beavis]
Yeah! Heheh, he was talkin about you Butt-head
(B: Shut up Beavis!) Heheh, he's cool, hehehe

[Positive K]
Just cause you go on a date with a honey
doesn't necessarily mean, you got to spend your own money
But you can be Sonny with your cash and Cher
Hold up the +Double+ go +Dutch+ and make her pay, her own fare

[Butt]	Dutch chicks?
[Beav]	Yeah heheh, Dutch chicks don't make you pay, heheh
	They like, treat you, heheh mhmh

[Butt-head]
(come to my love..)
Come to Butt-head (come closer to my love..)
(Come to my love!) Come a little closer
(come closer to my love..)

[Beavis]
Yeah, eheheheh, heheh

[Positive K]
Keep em lookin (cool!) don't be taken or tooken in
Ninety percent of the time, it's just what they hear

[Butt-head]
You mean I can like, lie and stuff?

[Positive K]
Well umm.. basically, YEAH (B: Lying is cool!)
See you gotta kick the mackaframa type of grammar
Never let em say "You Can't Touch This," like Hammer

[Butt]	Uhhuhuh, he said "touch"
[Beav]	Yeah eh-hehe, and then he says "this"

[Positive K]
You gotta hug her tighter than a pair of Sassoons
and Butt-head then you be pullin in girls, like a vacumn
And you'll say I kiss you from your toes up to your cerebellum
(B: From your toes to your what?) 
When you're alone, this is what you tell em

* {Positive K - singing}  (Butt-head - following along)

{All my life I've been} (Uhh.. all my life)
{searchin for a star..} (.. I've been.. uhh, stars)
{Now my search is over} (huhhuh, uhh, my search is..)
{.. and here we are...} (here we are..)
                        (.. huhuh.. uhh, uhh my search..)

[Positive K]
Now that's the whole synapsis, I hope you catch this
and stay away from girls, who playin roles like an actress
Now I think that's nuff said
But if all fails, keep sayin..

[Butt-head]
