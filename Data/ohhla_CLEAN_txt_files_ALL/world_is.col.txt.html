[Verse 1]
It's Cole, won't lie, won't stop 'til the race is won
Niggas who be rapping how real they are
Usually turn out to be the fakest ones
Carolina where I made it from
Cold world no blanket son
Girls fast how Jamaicans run
Puffing on the city where the Lakers from, L-A, L-A, la la
So high everything is a "ha ha" for me
Dreaming of the days of a drop 500
And a bad bitch that will go to Popeyes for me
You can never tell me that I'm not hungry
If you ever felt what's inside my tummy
My mind wondering now, is my time running out
Is the Lord up top with a stop watch for me
Hope not

[Refrain]
My world is empty without you babe
My world is empty without you

[Verse 2]
A wise nigga told me don't chase that cash
Follow your heart you'll make that fast
Does a stripper love to shake that ass
Or does she wish to erase that past
Got a nigga in her face just gassed
Like "baby girl why you take this path"
Stack in his hand trynna make that last
All she thinking bout is how to take his last
Rub titties in his face and laugh
Gotta try not to look fake in fact
A little more money like a few more 20's
When you let that nigga grab your naked ass
Okay he's gone now, roll her eyes when he whispers in her ear
"This ain't the life for you baby let me take you out of here"
Cause

[Refrain]

She like nigga yeah right
You know how much motherfucking money I'm making

[Verse 3]
Yeah
My niggas sit back blowing the L
Only getting high cuz we closer to hell
Nigga trying to live like Hova, but well
We broke and that dough coming slow as a snail
Hustle hard in the snow in the hail
Hit the block like a postman with mail
My brother got knocked now they hold him in cells
My mom broke but she posted the bail
Someway, somehow nigga feeling
Like the sun down even when the sun up
Hear the sound out the window of the gun bust
And you wonder why niggas keep the gun tucked
But this how niggas was brung up
A mother just trying to raise her son up
'Til a stray bullet got his lungs struck
And the Governor couldn't give one fuck
While she singing

[Refrain]</pre>
