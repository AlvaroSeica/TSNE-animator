Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1: Andy Mineo]
What you wanna do, act loco?
Hit 'em with the old to the flow
That I grew up on then I grew up on
I'm funny now how I flow for Hova
Heh, words twisted, but you know I'm sober
Never really been the type to pour up
When I get this thing going I don't like to slow up
Mouth moving like a motor when I bite the flow up
But I bet they won't stop let me go let me go
Woo! I'mma show off every ability God's giving me to go off
And ainât nobody mad about the beauty of the Vatican and tabernacle
So, when I'm rapping you can add it in
Breaking 'em with the shatter
They're gonna wanna put me in a place with pattern
I'mma damage 'em every time like a player that's on the cover of Madden
God be the original, we brag
Look at Him

[Hook: Andy Mineo]
I feel like I'm Paganini

[Verse 2: KB]
Uhh, lemme do it
K to the second letter
Finna get it popping
Coming out the pocket like oooo!
Everybody get to rocking doing the Paganini
Killing the beat, my tongue is like a violin
Give it to them like I'm not a human
When I'm doing what I'm doing, keeping it coming like an automatic shooting
When we get to ripping it ridiculous
And everybody gets to speaking about these riveting brothers that's going in again
But they don't know, even when they got that flow (when they got that flow)
I don't know why they boast, everybody's gifts borrowed
Look, producers, directors, skilled architects
Just do what they do to whom they're connected
True was the God that chooses to rest them
Who is the one you think they reflecting

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Canon]
Canon, Yo, hey Andy, okay
So down for my clique, shut up, y'all corny, oh shoot, shut up
I've been itching to stick 'em up with this killer
Canon coming to hit him harder Ooh kill 'em
Hold up, I've been hitting everything up in me like I'm Paganini
Hitting every rhythm like a milli chopped ya
I know you heard Twista, and Tech-a-Nina hitting ya but Canon's original
I'mma Midwest Monster, Kill em!
Blaaaat! blaaaat! Mineo and Kevin got adrenaline
Coming to drill em with real gospel
Coming up to the game
Still the same
Bringing the name
Bringing the fame
To the glory they follow Him and the father
While I'm coming and killing the game
I'm breaking 'em off and we know
They steady tryna imitate the steelo
I'm hitting with fire, spitting super wild
Running with the young and unashamed
I'm Paganini on a kilo amigo
