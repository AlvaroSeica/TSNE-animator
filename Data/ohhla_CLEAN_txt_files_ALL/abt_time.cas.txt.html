[Cassie talking]

Weve been through this a thousand times
And ive never been more sure then I am right now
{Cassie ugh shhh}
Please dont say anything
Its just about that time

I guess its about time that I'm finnaly moving on
I dont really care if its right or wrong
And in spite of the way I love your touch
You know its gon be better for both of us
It hurts like hell but I got to try
You already know the reason why
So no matter whos right or wrong
I think its finnaly time that I'm moving on

Ohh I cant stop the way {I love you}
Ive got to let this go
Although weve {tried}
Doesnt really matter no more
And I dont know what I stay here for
Especially when I know I gotta make a move

I guess its about time that I'm finnaly moving on
I dont really care if its right or wrong
And in spite of the way I love your touch
You know its gon be better for both of us
It hurts like hell but I got to try
You already know the reason why
So no matter whos right or wrong
I think its finnaly time that I'm moving on

Dont tell me I should stay {Its too late now}
To think we can make this work somehow
You should know the truth {Its over}
Over and done
Ohh and I cant believe
All of this time youve had me thinking
Thinking you would call me late night
Knowing damn well you wouldnt do it
Telling me I was still on your mind
I dont know why you had to put me through it
And I'm thinking I'm still livin for your love
It was all over and you knew it
Although its gonna be hard to let this go
Boy this is something I gotta do

I guess its about time that I'm finnaly moving on
I dont really care if its right or wrong
And in spite of the way I love your touch
You know its gon be better for both of us
It hurts like hell but I got to try
You already know the reason why
So no matter whos right or wrong
I think its finnaly time that I'm moving on

Gave you all of my heart
All of my body
All of my soul
All of my precious time
And you know its so hard loving somebody
I loved you so good baby you cant deny
You know this time that respect goes away
Let it fade away
And the only way to heal is to give me time and space

I guess its about time that I'm finnaly moving on
I dont really care if its right or wrong
And in spite of the way I love your touch
You know its gon be better for both of us
It hurts like hell but I got to try
You already know the reason why
So no matter whos right or wrong
I think its finnaly time that I'm moving on</pre>
