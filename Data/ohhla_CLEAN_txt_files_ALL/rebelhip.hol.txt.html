[Chorus: Timbo King]
One o'clock, two o'clock, we don't like cops
Three o'clock, four o'clock, kings of the block
Five o'clock, six o'clock, five or six shots
Seven o'clock, eight o'clock, rebel hip hop
Nine o'clock, ten o'clock, jailhouse rock
Eleven o'clock, twelve o'clock, we gon' pop

[Pro the Leader]
Hardcore lyric, hardcore rhymes
Hardcore state of mind, you are way, far behind
State of emergency, maybe in, any type or form of currency
Currently, you went soft to me
Raw hip hop, I got burning in me
You can learn a thing from me, you lightweight, sonny
I make money, you straight funny style
Run it now, while I run it down, from the underground
Intriguing, captivating, listen
Ready your self, challenge superior competition
The pain, the struggle, the hunger comes from within
Begin, beating men repeatedly into submission

[Chorus]

[Dopestyle]
So, MC lockjaw, slave Amistad
Nigga wreck these stains, far from Purple Rain
I'mma pop another princess, rhyming on the biz
Second string, do my thing, all net, hail the slurs
A tisk and a tasket, smack for you bastard
Piss and you pull, cueball like you on special
Lyricy, I flip, laying dead, you got hits
I'mma werewolf and I hate you, so I will defend you
Tag you like that wall, next to the train track
Serving MC, on dig 'em Smacks
With milk and your bowl, nigga with no soul
Soggy face, sow your flakes, into the red zone, rebel hip hop

[Chorus]

[Holocaust]
Unexplained tragedies occur in the Bermuda Triangle
A paradise, a phantom, revolution of execution
A retribution to the water pollution
The streets of Ancient Rome were invaded
With rival crooks, the 19th Century Europe thieves
And pick pockets band together to outwit the police
Bells and ringing inside the minds
A violent act, deadly scholarship injuries
Many of the most deadly secret societies
Have been military groups, determined to get their way
By murder and mayhem
But die, sometime in history
Is clouded by myth and legends, as with the Japanese
Ninja clans of the 11th to 16th Century
