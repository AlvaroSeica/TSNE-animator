Typed by: OHHLA

[Intro/Chorus]
Now, everybody who knows me understands I'm a humble guy
Those who thinkin they owe me
Just do me a favor, leave me the fuck alone
Leave me the fuck alone, leave me the fuck alone
Leave me the fuck alone, leave me the fuck alone
Just leave me the fuck alone, leave me the fuck alone
Leave me the fuck alone, leave me the fuck alone
Leave me the fuck alone, oooo I regret meetin all of you

[Hopsin]
Lately how much psychotic stress have you been through?
Right now I hate every fuckin body includin you
I'm on the edge you'll be lucky if you do get through
If I go crazy then this the son I'm a lose it to
Please tell my family and my friends this...
I was never happy to begin with, I actually pretended
Too many hands I done lifted, all my life plans got evicted, I'm mad I existed
I'm finally droppin all the shit you motherfuckers hand me
The only girl I ever loved doesn't understand me
Since I was youn I tried to be way more than what I can be
And people still never show respect when I demand it
Y'all mentality is fuck me but I don't need nobody but me
Trust me, it don't seem like it but I been livin out the matrix
Face it, I'm a lot smarter than you think bitch

[Chorus]

[Hopsin]
Everyday it's like the same crap
What if I died and never came back
You'd hate that wouldn't you
I'm a put a blade to your neck, push it through
Quit tellin me shit that I shouldn't do, oooh...
I been blockin my feelings but now I can't hide em
Been lookin for God how come I can't find him
Nothin in my fuckin world seems to go right
Even though I hate suicide I need to go try
I live my life the way I wanna, I ain't pleasin you
Got a problem I'll fuck you up I got a reason to
Y'all tried to gain my trust sayin we believe in you
Then you walkin on me after all that we been through
That ain't even cool, now death is what I hope you get
And just remember that I told you this...
We ain't cool, I don't owe you shit
Look what you made of me, now I'm... psh
Matter fact just stay away from me

[Chorus]

[Hopsin]
What if I left this world today in this crucial pain that I'm In? (I'm In)
Would you be there at my funeral sayin 'oh I loved him' (loved him)
Or maybe, just maybe, you'll be that one nigga that never showed up. (showed up)
I'm about to lose my mind, why must I have it so rough?
Listen closely as I'm rappin this
I used to think money brought people happiness
It does but we never think about what happens after it
Since I got it, I started to learn hate, everybody turns fake
Wantin shit like it's there fuckin birthday
And that just adds on the stress I'm already dealin with
What am I supposed to let it build and sit?
Hell no, since then my fuckin balls grew
I said it once and I'll say it again fuck all you

[Chorus]</pre>
