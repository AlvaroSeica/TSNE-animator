[Intro]
M-O, T-H-U-G (Mo Thug!)
M-O, T-H-U-G... M-O, T-H-U-G (Mo Thug!)
M-O, T-H-U-G... M-O, T-H-U-G (Mo Thug!)

[Chorus]
It started with the "Family Scriptures" (M-O, T-H-U-G)
Then we came back with the "Family Reunion" (M-O, T-H-U-G; Mo Thug!)
We takin off on "The Mothership" (M-O, T-H-U-G)
That's over with, now it's called "The Movement" (M-O, T-H-U-G; Mo Thug!)

[Felecia]
M-O T-H-U-G
You know that's who we beeeee (Mo Thug!)
With so much variety - keepin it crunk
Keepin it crunk so you know you can't run (Mo Thug!)
This is what it is full of what you been warned
So pump up the volume and let it consume you (Mo Thug!)
So pump up the volume and let it consume youuuuu... (Mo Thug!)

[Ken Dawg]
You know the stamp, shit you know the camp
Fist comin, out the pyramid, it's started from the 'Land
Introduced to the world, in the year 9-6
Playa, ain't no reason I'm startin my hoes off the rip
It's a new twist, people lasso'd, it's a new list
In the bit 2002, we on some new shit
Ken Dawg steal this, hustle mode, blowin 'dro
It's tatted all on my shoulders, playboy I'm rollin with Mo; right?

[Skant Bone]
Here we go again, it's 2002 you know I'm rollin with my fam
M-O T-H-U-G's comin with these hits, damn
It's been like two damn years since we last dropped
Now we back in your face with a single that's hot
We come to give the streets what it's missin see
And that's hits, Mo hits from my Family
So pump your fist and groove to this, or get up and bob yo' head
Who say Mo Thug Records dead? (Mo Thug!)

[Chorus]  2X

[PD + Lil' D]
That's us, that's it, you guessed it, that Mo Thug clique
We flock shots, pack gats, let's make them clubs rock hits
The club rock hits, the mo' cheddar the mo' better it gets
We climb charts like "Damn, do that even exist?"
And don't miss it, the mission, just listen, the music
This new shit to groove with is now called The Movement
You can choose it or lose it, cause units we movin
Precision is the way to get it, yup that's how we do this
What you do is put yo' hands up, in fact stand up
Cause this new weapon thrown is for the damn club
Niggaz in line wanna push and shove
They came to see the thugs rip it up and show 'em love
Now give it up, what?
That's right we back man, now capture the track, dance
Don't get stuck and glance just wave yo' hands
From side to side like that man, we comin back with a vengeance
So pretenders no need for askin, what? (Mo Thug!)

[Chorus]  2X

[DJ Skail]
Nigga this the movement
Ain't nothin to it but to do it out here, prove it
I'll crack your skull and leave you layin with a contusion
Cause I'm just coolin with my family makin music, that's how we movin
Uhh, lyrics keep on flippin just like a freestyle
And we gon' keep on rippin, and shit gon' be wild
Mo Thugs all up in your club
Bumpin your system and them ballers bendin corners on dubs, what?

[Stew Deez]
It's the M-O (O) T-H-U-G
Y'all niggaz know (know) your nigga Stew Deez
Original member from the group E.M.T.
In the club poppin bottles with everybody
Not Part Three but Fo', and we back at you hoes
You niggaz that don't know, we're back and we're strong
It's like whoa when we pull up a truck, 3 Benz and a Lex'
In full effect, highly infected of that information cause uhh

[Thin C.]
Now what was you thinkin Mo wasn't gonna represent Cleveland?
Haters belly achin and bleedin, preach shit is misleadin
Thugs made it up from creepin, got chicas leavin they home
Thinkin Thin gon' get 'em gone to they thong, Mo to the Bone
When you slide on the pole, shorty shake it for me
You can come out your clothes for your nigga Thin C.
When you ready to roll baby you're goin with me
When you're checkin for Mo, keep it T-H-U-G! (Mo Thug!)

[Chorus]  2X

M-O, T-H-U-G {*repeat till fade*}</pre>
