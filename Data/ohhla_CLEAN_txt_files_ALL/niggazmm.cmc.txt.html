[Intro: Champ M.C.]
Cheah, this that shit I'm talking about
Check it out out, kick that flava shit

[Champ M.C.]
On July 13, at about 9:00 on the dot
Four lil bastards are scheming on my block
I'm just chilling outside, having fun
Niggas got guns on 2nd &amp; Madison
I funk the scenery, another public enemy
He ran up on me, called my name, and started shooting at me
I looked up, it wasn't a friend or a foe
But hell no, they goin all out for the damn dough
I scream for help, but people look amazed
Afraid, I thought it was the end of my happy days
I can't believe that it was someone I knew
I had to struggle, scuffle my way up the avenue
Now here I come to get away from the bullshit
They emptied the clip by how many times I got hit
My crew ran across the street, that was useful
Don't worry about them, just get my ass to the hospital

[Chorus X5: Champ M.C. (???)]
Niggaz who murda mine they get murdered
Niggaz who murda mine (get murdered)

[Champ M.C.]
I was nowhere around, nowhere in sight
I got a beef, niggaz really got beef tonight
Shit is on, even though two wrongs don't make a right
I'm rolling deep, you should know we gonna put up a good fight
You tried to perpetrate and terminate
Someone who is loved by the human race
You better watch your back and cut some slack
Lay on your Ps &amp; Qs and thats that
You took the man as a joke using gun smoke
And you wouldn't be happy until we croaked
We gotta take those fugitives
They tried to take their lives plus the ones who want to live
They don't think about the things they do and those fuckin niggas should do life
They tried to murder, manslaughter
Niggas who murdered mine will get murdered

[Chorus X5]

[Champ M.C.]
Niggaz on a mission, while I'm trippin
My trigger happy finger itchin and I'm mad as hell
Im the realest as it can get
Breaking out a cold sweat, hnuting ya down
It's your ass I'm gonna get
Trying to hide out cuz your head's on the vendetta
When they catch your ass, you'll be running to west again
Nigga, oh shit you done did it now
You don't know the background, no, you don't know my style
Pain hurts you little bitch ass
You wanna be the man so bad, thats why your ass won't last
So they dig graves like six deep
I put a hole in your head that leaps your ass right off your feet
How the fuck you gonna play a playa when your game is weak
And your brains are all over the concrete
Damn straight you better bring some
You be dead on arrival with a dick in your mouth

[Chorus X3]

[Outro: Champ M.C.]
Yo bust your whole fly shit man, nawhatimsaying
This is for all the niggas and the bitches, word up
You wanna keep it real, keep it real
Nawhatimsaying, don't try to play big willie, cuz your not
Nawhatimsaying, don't try to fuck with nobody cuz they ain't fuckin with you
Cuz you might fuck with the right nigga that'll blast your ass and not
give a fuck about you
So this go to bitch ass nigga, niggas who murder mine get murdered </pre>
