See I've been here for thirty some years
Lookin' at myself in the same dirty mirror
So it ain't like I don't comprehend
Open that bottle and swallow that friend
No crime to take a little too much
Got time to drink away a few months
Got a little cocaine habit
But he says he only does it
If somebody else has it
Go do that shit do that shit lady
She went vegetarian for the baby
Third trimester see the kid kick
She showed me outside
When she gave me a cigarette
Shit there's no way to measure it
But not every pony grows up to be a pegasus
You gotta let people be hypocrites
Count your blessings and mind your businesses

Stuck with yourself like the rest of us
Dirt gets done and then we back to dust
Runnin' in place sun in my face
Let me fly away heaven won't wait
Heaven won't wait let me fly away
Getting no way every day

Just tryin' to keep my mind on work
It's like
That's the only way to love this life on earth
It's like
Everyone takes number one in the race
Cause we all keep running in place
Here kitty kitty can't train that fox
Must be drinkin' that name brand scotch
All of us cut from the same damn cloth
Some of us never cut the price tags off
She ended up on a pole
With her heels pointin'
At a jesus she used to know
Stripped her down to her naked body
We made her drown in a lake full of patriarchy
And in between the pride and the misery
With an infinite supply of sympathy
Are these invisible walls that hold me
Like this goldfish bowl is the whole sea see?

Stuck with yourself like the rest of us
Dirt gets done and then we back to dust
Runnin' in place sun in my face
Let me fly away heaven won't wait
Heaven won't wait let me fly away
Getting no way every day

Yeah the child in the mirror was homely
So he learned early on how to switch in to low key
Little person observant and accurate
Grew the skills to argue
And the passion to back it with
Kick over the blocks just to rebuild  em
Mom and pop used to pop sound familiar?
Daddy had to leave but momma kept hurtin'
So he stepped up to help be an anchor and a burden
And right around the same time
He started noticin' girls
But they wouldn't pay him any mind
And if they ever did he got nervous
You shoulda seen him practice on his hand
For his first kiss
And even though he was too young to hunt and gather
Hungry puppy had to learn how to front and swagger
It didn't matter it was all self esteem
At sixteen you only needed one on your team
And mom and dad was never gettin' back together
So he was on some baby we gon' make it last forever
Basically married right outta high school
Five years of gettin' high and fightin' at a drive thru
When he hit twenty-one they made a son
But on his twenty-second birthday
The relationship was done
Now he's got a best friend instead of a wife
But he feels like he stole the best years of her life
After that it was one codependent to the next
A lotta love a lotta hate and a little bit of great sex
Self learning in between the self loathing
Strangled in a cycle can't feel yourself choking
Some of them would overlap
Some of them would double back
None of  em deserved to be exposed
To all the trouble that he posed
Strike one? not even out of fear
He don't even do rough sex
You bite him and he's outta here
Make no mistake he puts the man in manipulate
And he's attracted to the women that reciprocate
Y'all can kick karma  til it's getting late
Until momma's little drama
Is the topic of the big debate
And nowadays the confidence is off the page
Cause women are attracted
To that clown on the stage
He's only in town for a handful of hours
But rapunzel wanna come down
And dance in the flowers
Wanna make a smile wanna make a laugh
Wanna make up for the mistakes in the past
Wanna act like he doesn't know better
If payback's a bitch he'll be in debt forever
Insecure impatient
Temporary gratification self-validation
That's what it's made of its all true
And it's the only reason
That he's even talkin' to you
Who?

You can try to fix my broken wings
You can know all the words to the songs I sing
But you don't need to know what's wrong with me
Unless you think you gonna come home with me</pre>
