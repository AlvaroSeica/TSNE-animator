[Flesh]
Down, gotta lay me down, down, down to sleep
(Down, gotta lay me down)
I pray to the Lord that a holy ghost
Bless my soul to keep (Pray to the Lord, my soul) 
And if I should die before I wake up, wake up, wake up
Hope that he saved a place in heaven
So I pray every day for my soul he take up

Gettin' my hustle in every day
Each day, when I would get on my knees and pray
Everyday faced with all kinda playa hation
Why they wanna make my sanity tighten
Pray, hey, hey, hey, and I got a bueatiful family
A lovely wife, and my little pretty daughter 
And I got two sons, handsome just like me
So I count blessing, after each blessing
Every last blessing I learned a lesson
I didn't realize my blessings keep me from stressin'
Jesus came, and died on the cross
To save us from our sins, our sins
The kingdom of heaven's at hand
How much to repent to get in
Again and again I'm sendin' my praises up above
And I don't know when Im entertainin' angels 
So I gotta show more love
Gotta honor my mother and father with all my heart
My little brothers Steven and Stewart
We don't let demons break us apart
Yeah, you know that's a no-no for sure
I can put it on my soul
I can even put it in mode
And run the little seconds down the road
I'm ready to go
Steady rollin', leavin' these strangers
If the whole world would end tomorrow
Tomorrow just might be the end
So wait for the Lord and follow

Chorus

[Flesh]
Must you prepare for the Judgment, baby
Now, tell me what you've been up to lately
Situations steady come on the daily, no
It don't really surprise me
It don't amaze me, but it do drive me crazy
Demons, they keep tryin' to fade me, and it's so evil
All they wanna do is aggrivate me
Trip, and I flip, don't make me
See even when i'm not lookin' for trouble
Trouble, it seem to come find me
That's how it is when you live in the limelight
But I don't worry, put it all behind me
Gotta get down, way down, stay down
Satan up under my foot
Gotta rebuke, and recite the scriptures from my holy book
That's when it straight shook
Look at the prophecy comin' down in history
Still it ain't no mystery, can't let it repeat
Good's gonna demolish evil
What a meraculous, wonderful victory
Ooh, yeah, Armageddon waitin' for the moment
When the lid pop, when it goes down, don't be sleepin'
Cause it'll creep on us, send a thief in the night
Watch out, wake up, stay woke
And gather more faith in Jesus, lead us
Get ready to do the will of God
So that he can keep us from the wrath of firey brimstones
Stay strong and hold onto your faith
And it won't greet you, yet meet you, deciet you
We're leadin' and walkin' through heaven's gates

Chorus

[Pray]
Our father, which art in heaven, hollow would be thy holy name

Down, gotta lay me down, down, down to sleep
(Down, gotta lay me down)
I pray to the Lord that a holy ghost
Bless my soul to keep (Pray to the Lord, my soul)
And if I should die before I wake up, wake up, wake up 
Hope that he saved a place in heaven
So I pray every day for my soul he take up
(Hallelleja, hallelleja hallelleja
Hallelleja is the highest praise/forever, Amen)

Oh, Lord, oh, Lord, how majestic is thy name in all the earth? </pre>
