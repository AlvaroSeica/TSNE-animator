You wanna get with us because we got it goin on(x4)

Check it out
I'm rollin
Steady strollin
The microphone is on
Yo let me hold it
Comin to the spot
Get it hot
Tell em turn it up
So I can rock
The beats, the rhymes, they all in place
We wanna show you what we gonna do in the place
Hold it down
Hold it down with the crown
Jungle Brothers giving you that funky sound
All styles, no matter what you like
We bring it to you, everyday be on the mic
Strike back
Find out where we at
Comin to you live
YO

(chorus 1)
We in the vip
Yeah yeah (x3)
We in the vip
WonÂ’t you come see me

(chorus 2)
Like this (like this)
Like that (like that) (x4)

My only grandfather
DJ Afrika Bambaata
Sat me down and told me that I had to have a lotta
Soul and control when the microphone is on
Pregnate the rhythms and the words will be born
Take em all back with an old-school twist
But make sure you do it to them just like this
Take em to the east
Take em to the west
Take em to the north, south
Yo you know the rest
Mike G where you at?
And we comin from the back
The beat sounds phat
And we like it like that
The rhyme is on time and we cuttin no slack
We in the VIP cause we got it like that
So let's take em back with that old-school twist
But make sure we do it to them just like this
Take em to the east
Take em to the west
Take em to the north, south
Yo you know the rest

(chorus 1)

My name is Baby Bam
Turn out the jam
If you ain't got the fifty grand
Dont even think about it man
We in the vip
All the drinks is on me
This is my party
I thought everything was free
We in the VIP(x4)

(chorus 1)

We in the VIP
