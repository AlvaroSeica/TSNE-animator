Song:   Say Goodbye
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Realize life's poetic potency's peakin' full bloom
And wreak havoc spittin' quick on average
Try not to speak too soon
We a' sing to that the girls that swoon
I didn't wind these ends by
On which relying is they can tell by ten times
These rhymes is enzymes, step in time
From the dark and sparks and then shines
Through end times (end times), deep ain't it
That's what strokes my voice, evokes the pictures we painted

Let's say goodbye, let's say goodbye
And I promise myself that I'm not gonna cry
No more holding me close, while you stare in my eyes
It's over now, so let's say goodbye

Lookin' back at you, and how things were supposed to be
When everything was cool
But now you took my thought from me
Who's that knockin' at my door
I know it can't be you
Cuz everything that would be nice
For you just don't do
And I don't really care
What you have to say
And everybody knows
Ain't no need to pretend baby
When I done all I can
There's nothin' left to do
I put my power in go
There's no lookin' back at you

Let's say goodbye, let's say goodbye
And I promise myself that I'm not gonna cry
No more holding me close, while you stare in my eyes
It's over now, so let's say goodbye

Hey mama I feel your pain and I
Realize you're goin' through things and I
Walk through it with you just to prove to you
Good gonna rise from all this mess you're goin' through
Darkness come before the morning sun
Move with me, move yeah, follow me,
Fall into the groove yeah, do what it do,
Then release it like fool yeah,
Takin' you to school yeah, ooh yeah

She said "Why goodbye, it sounds so final
Why not see you tomorrow or I'll call you later"
Cause goodbye best describes how it ends up later
How we pretend like the other's to blame for love faint
Blind to the times I tried and just can't
See the other side my pride said don't let it
Crowd, you're crowd, your wings need to spread
Standin' in the middle of a mental armageddon

Let's say goodbye, let's say goodbye
And I promise myself that I'm not gonna cry
No more holding me close, while you stare in my eyes
It's over now, so let's say goodbye [x2]

It's best for me
Had to let you go
I can't take it no more
I'm not gonna cry baby not over you baby
It's over now say goodbye
It's smooth sailing now that, that you're gone
I can move on and now I feel so free
It's smooth sailing now that, that you're gone
I can move on because I said
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye baby

Let's say goodbye, let's say goodbye
And I promise myself that I'm not gonna cry
No more holding me close, while you stare in my eyes
It's over now, so let's say goodbye [x2]</pre>
