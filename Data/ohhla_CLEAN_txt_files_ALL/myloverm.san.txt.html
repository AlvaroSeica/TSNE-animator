[Intro: Juelz Santana]
For lovin me girl
Just wanna thank you
Look at what you can do man
I like this shit right here man
Girl c'mon
Let's do it like this

[Juelz Santana]
Santana's so focused on you
Come holla at a boy that's focused on you
Shorty I ain't tryin to give you the run around
I'm just tryin to come get you a run around
Skip through a couple towns
Maybe skip through a couple rounds
If your man act dumb I'ma shut him down
I'm sorta a long distance brother
Long checks,long chips, long dick and rubber
Come roll with a pimp or gangsta
Hustler by nature
Trust that I'll take ya
I'll show you the rules and perimeters
Show you how to move with the ooze how to handle it
Show you how to cut loose soon as we scramble it
On the block as soon as the moon it be scramblin'
And you can be my down ass bitch
Yeah baby that's for sure
I'm a show you how package raw
How to snap it on
How to take trips with the package on
How to go and come back with the package gone
Just stacks of cash beyond

[Chorus: Juelz + Jones]
And ya'll nigaz betta cuff ya girls
Cuz Santana and jones is runnin up the girls (yeah)
No game just fuck your girls
Pollute her mind and corrupt the world (yeah)

Give her pounds, give her pies, giver her cake
Hit a town, hit a city, hit a state
Every club, every party, we fly
Bagging bitches every party and high

[Jim Jones]
Please believe Jimmy Jizzy's the truth
Every where I go to brezies I'm true
Man they tell me that I over does it
You need to slow up you over thugging (so what)
But the hoes slugging in the open public
I smoke like fuck it, I just roll up puffing
Now they roll up fucking
Take two totes and love it
Yeah yeah plus my bitches swear
I'm like Richard Gere
Put them in my coup moving fast switching gears
Get it crystal clear
Stay crispy to the fit in every kick I wear
She was feeling my gangsta (gangsta)
Summer time Air One's jeans my tank top
Baby girl I'm a player with passport
Moving fast hundred grand on the black Porsche
Please love get your feet up off my dashboard
This is cash drawer we gonna crash course

[Chorus: Juelz + Jones]
And ya'll nigaz betta cuff ya girls
Cuz Santana and jones is runnin up the girls (yeah)
No game just fuck your girls
Pollute her mind and corrupt the world (yeah)

Give her pounds, give her pies, giver her cake
Hit a town, hit a city, hit a state
Every club, every party, we fly
Baggin bitches every party and high</pre>
