Typed by: AZ Lyrics

uh you don't want no problems here what's going on
the best teen rapper rapping on this microphone
twizzy here mr bad to the bone
and if you think you are better you're dead gone
you don't want no problems here what's going on
the best teen rapper rapping on this microphone
twizzy here mr bad to the bone
and if you think you are better you're dead gone

I got so much money it don't make no sense
fresh panorama mint flow dark pent
a superman in disguise I'm like a clark kent
back to the panorama color told me cherry mint
boy blues I find your clues doggy is the hint
you better file back before we have you heaven sent
younger real is king kongs and godzillas
red bones gartonhs even tia tequilas
we come in one heaters camouflauge wife beaters
jumping out with camers like you're a star on cheaters
punk boy now pockets full of burritos
I come knock it out the park I'm a young barry jeter

you don't want no problems here what's going on
the best teen rapper rapping on this microphone
twizzy here mr bad to the bone
and if you think you are better you're dead gone
you don't want no problems here what's going on
the best teen rapper rapping on this microphone
twizzy here mr bad to the bone
and if you think you are better you're dead gone

back at it again like I never left them
now these niggaz running talking like I never blessed them
I helped them before they can't forget it though
and if I wouldntve I wouldve been on a while ago
I'm a beast show me but you knew that
young money youngn till the end I'm the the cool cat
why you running where I looking like a cool rat
stand next to me they say that's lil twizzy and whos dat
can you trouble them put some bass up in your voice
get off my stick I talk how I wanna it's my choice
yes I'm balling on these kids like playing horse
burning off up in my porsche
rolling to the girls house just to leave them moist
but look

you don't want no problems here what's going on
the best teen rapper rapping on this microphone
twizzy here mr bad to the bone
and if you think you are better you're dead gone
you don't want no problems here what's going on
the best teen rapper rapping on this microphone
twizzy here mr bad to the bone
and if you think you are better you're dead gone
