[Deacon the Villian]
Listen...
Once upon a time fell in love with an aura 
but the horror, said she couldn't love me 'til tomorrow 
Oh the disdain when tomorrow never came 
I was a moth to her flame named martyr 
Met her on the MARTA, King station, oh the irony 
So many wrinkles in my mind, in no time she would iron me out 
Help me find what I was about 
Give me water that could last in a drought  
Y'see, me, I was lost... in the shadow of death 
She had the valleys and peaks and with the shallowest breaths 
She told me bout light, took me right to the crest 
Showed me darkness, the heartlessness parked in its depths 
I was kept 'tween them legs where she refereed'd me 
Was confused but her clues brought the best I could be 
to the top... when she left, thought I'd drop 
But instead, tilted head back and watched, you see... you see.. 

[Chorus]
She'll guide you through shadows... and to a star
She'll guide you through shadows... and to a star

[Substantial]
Yeah... 
When, you took me by the hand 
Friends, who disguised they plans 
Went, from allies or fam 
To enemies, well I'll be damned 
Oh man, light's so blinding dog 
Amazing if you're seeing I, without a guide at all 
Ninjas will hide in fog, predators close on prey 
Sun will come out tomorrow, today he throwin shade 
...I couldn't see it 
Before I wasn't hip but then our trip made me believe it 
Guided me through darkness where route ain't known as scenic 
I'm seein these so called angels cast the shadow of demon
The reason: envy, they want what you're eatin 
Like they're inclined to dine on spoils you been receivin 
They ain't help you grow or give you land to plant the seed in, it's seeming 
They only pick you when they see you are in season, Eden 

[Chorus]

[RA Scion]
Uh, one two, one two...
Let the goddesses guide us, goddesses guide us... 
Yo I'm solely dependent, on the benefits of the soul 
of those energies in it, fuel the soul and power the motor 
We been the descendants, ever since she sent us the motive 
Witches apprentice, hold us Aluna by the shoulder 
to show you the road is, full of so much you'd never notice 
Legend after focus adjust though, and step closer 
We kept going so y'all could see what's floatin in the waters 
I go with the torch to the farthest corner for it's over 
We provide guidance, through this form of applied science 
Writers alliance, we tryna shine a light behind us 
For seekers to follow, beacon keep blinkin eternally 
This journey is hell that's why I felt compelled when Deacon hollered 
My people need reminding itâs some life lessons 
How we define us specimens of the divine essence 
How to find direction whenever dead of night has set in 
Challenge your fears, shadows only appear when light is present 
We guide you... we guide you... 
Through the darkest parts of life to spark a light or to 
Help you to see a few emcees who's here to fight for ya 
Signs of victory reliance on the highest order - shine

[Outro]
"...and to a star"
"You're sure to lose your mind..."</pre>
