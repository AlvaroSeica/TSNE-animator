[Dr. Dooom]
Yo J, you bought this bitch's food
Yo, these bitches ain't payin for shit
They up here eatin, and gettin ready to plan
to go to somebody else's house after this
They usin us man, fuck this!

{cut n scratch: "Look hear bitch!"}

Bitch you got a fat stomach
Your braids look tacky, and you're fuckin broke
Like Rakim said, _I Ain't No Joke_
You're posin as a high-class stinky-ass hoodrat
Fuck behind any man's back, bum bitch at the Shark Bar
Lookin like an aardvark with a fucked up parked car
Got the nerve to have a diamond, I'm embarassed you keep rhymin
Fuck you Simple Simon -- materialistic and twisted
Fake mink, buy your own fuckin drink
Big shots sport you but you got a fuckin weave and I can even
grab a white girl and a black woman body in my world
Beverly Hills flashy shit, you on some classy girl shit
Drivin a drug dealer's BMW, your license ain't even fuckin legit
Just stop and quit it, you need to admit it
You're broke and strippin
Livin in the Motel 8, you're fuckin jailbait
Tattoos with names on your arms
Bighead babies with diapers, frontin fucks
Gettin in a basketball player's Mercedes
Fucked up faces tryin to hang in romantic places
Get the fuck out of here
your friends too they gon' need some ends too
Look for somethin what?  With funky-ass G strings all up in your butt
Way to feed this elephant, this bitch is always hungry
Ghetto superstar tryin to be intelligent

{cut n scratch: "Look hear bitch!"}

Bitch gets no love, bitch gets no love
{cut n scratch: "Look hear bitch!"}
Bitch gets no love, bitch gets no love
{cut n scratch: "Look hear bitch!"}
Bitch gets no love, bitch gets no love
{cut n scratch: "Look hear bitch!"}
Bitch gets no love, bitch gets no love
{cut n scratch: "And I said look hear bitch!"}

Peep game at the frame stand, you ugly bitches front on my man
Not my type, the assholes that always wear them black pants
thinkin they hype -- con women, parasites
Lick a nigga ass in valet parkin, just to get a Puff Daddy ticket
Them corny bitches livin wicked
Guest-list bitch, wearin Tommy Girl cologne over piss
Wantin motherfuckers to call her Miss
In the club, you try to look like Deborah Cox with a fucked up house
I bet you got roaches and mouse
Look at sperm around your fuckin mouth
You can't even cook a meal right like a good woman down South
Runnin your mouth with a million dollar pussy stinkin
There's Massengil on the table while you rollin a blunt
watchin En Vogue on the cable - gettin your hair sewed in
cause your facial expression, lookin like a fuckin rodent
Loosen up bitch!  Stiff like the Tin Man
Don't even lingerie; always talkin about your dead man
Used to be a gangster -- I don't wanna hear that shit I'm eatin
I got some fine Puerto Rican girls I'm meeting
Y'all stay with these wack-ass has-beens
I'm leavin with the quickness
Y'all plastic monkeys at the Greek picnics

Bitch gets no love, bitch gets no love
{cut n scratch: "Look hear bitch!"}
Bitch gets no love, bitch gets no love
{cut n scratch: "Look hear bitch!"}
Bitch gets no love, bitch gets no love
{cut n scratch: "Look hear bitch!"}
Bitch gets no love, bitch gets no love
{cut n scratch: "I said look hear bitch!"}
