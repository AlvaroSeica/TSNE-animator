1st Verse:

Representing mental health 
Correction in my hand this pencil is worth
12 dead apostles 
Top shelf next to the bread I drink on Jesus's wine bottles
Here's a thesis in four equal pieces 
On the mic I burn like weed does yeah you just scored a good quarter
And forever I go pound for pound
And remember the sound you found
Is gonna leave other emcees down and out
Call me crazy and manic
I fall from the sky and this realm looks hazy cos I'm from another planet
So rhythm rhythm rhythm
This studio is a totally bitchin kitchen where shit gets written
And ya kids go missing
Cos they listen to the spit I'm kicking 
And flipping the script ripping it to bits keep listening to this grit

Hook:
 
People say i have a split personality
Don't get it confused with my wit personality
This could be a hit or my first fatality

2nd Verse:
 
Finally got it together
Rewind this three times and look in the mirror
Cos I combine rhymes that will make candy mans hook clearer
Used to pray till that book got nearer
To the content of my episodes
So decided to get potent and let it all go
Fuck a bitch while I'm rhyming yeah we both got a wet flow
She called me a handyman in the sack
Had to jet cos she gave me handy man and kept slapping my sack
Axe over the shoulders cos I'm hacking this track
Fighting back I'm back
Writing not wack
Lightning crack frightening on wax
Might sing fuck that!
Heavy mental music
Life's a rental so abuse it

Hook:
 
People say i have a split personality
Don't get it confused with my wit personality
This could be a hit or my first fatality</pre>
