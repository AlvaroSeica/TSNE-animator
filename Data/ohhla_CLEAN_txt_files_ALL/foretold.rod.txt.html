Typed by: Cno Evil

[Cno Evil]
Time is finally here, run and prepare
Take cover, say your prayers, I know that you're scared
It's The Rodentz, foretold future, your opponents
White Plains, New York, Red Zone, every single moment
We got Cno here, we got Mouse in here
Ya'll give up this year, with your tears of fears
Pride, honor, dignity, no sins in me
Not selling my soul to the devil, I'm from Sicily
Trials/tribulations, revolutions/revelation
Contribution/concentration, I'm moving the nation
The new sensation, no more waiting, I'm sick to my stomach
Once we hit, we go, deep into the earth like a comet (Bong!)
Flooding your waters, quakes and lava, cross your borders
The new world order, taking over, all your quarters, tomorrow
I got no sorrow, ya'll been warned for years and you didn't pay attention
Everybody click to our connection, now

[Chorus: Cno Evil]
Ya'll muthafuckas better step back
Cuz you know, The Rodentz is back
If you don't know, now you know
Cno Evil and Mouse, taking over the globe
Now that you know, you better duck down
Cuz The Rodentz is blasting that sound
Hold the crowns, through your town, bow down
You fuck around, bodies end up in lost and found

[Li-Mouse]
Lyrical alchemist, with magic that can save ya
Cno composes the fancy type shit, Fantasia
It's major, how we come through with the many flavors
Staying sweet and afloat like we, 'lifesavers'
Your style is dried like, the sun on some raisins
When the lyrics in the air, they be leaving skin abrasions
Divided we shine, the darker shadow we cast
It's just that easy, the simplicity to contrast
Us from the rest, I rhyme til my last breath
With, Cno to my left, we only part to death
Even then, the reaper's gonna have to fight for my soul
Entrance with flashing lights and ports, like hockey goals
Slapping lyrical shots to ya, weak ass goalies
Next time, put a sock in it, like Mick Foley
It's the foretold future, meaning the past is done
So look forward and realize the future has begun

[Chorus]

[Cno Evil] (Li-Mouse]
Step back, cuz we back, son, you better be ready
We enter into your dreams with nightmares like Freddy
(The odds are in our favor, cuz we got the ill behavior
Self saviors of the rap game, with the crazy flavors)
You rookie players step back, it's the hall of famers
Fuck platinum plaques, all the jewelry and paper
(We'd rather grab the mic and shut down all you haters
Go back and rehearse your rhymes, and call us later)
Cno Evil and Mouse, it's The Rodentz, get it right
We be there from the first round to the final fight
(Turn on your lights and just, witness the kids
We got all types of beats, that's fit for you like lids)
The shit's off the meatrack, foretold future fact
Blow at your back with our lyrical gats
(And that's that, so hurry up and tell your people
It's The Rodentz, the M-O-U-S-E and) Cno Evil

[Chorus 2X]

[Outro: Cno Evil (Li-Mouse)]
Foretold Future (yeah... step back..
Now you know.. taking over the globe...
That sound... now you know... taking over the globe...
Step back... step back... lost and found...)</pre>
