What the fuck!

[Barryington Levy]
Tell them already, we have to tell them again
Warn them already, we have to warn them again
Tell them already, we have to tell them again
Tell them already, we have to tell them again

In New York they wants me
And I'm gonna be there
Van-city's calling
And I'm gonna be there
In T-Dot, they wants me
And I'm gonna be there, spreading the vibes
All over the world

[Red-1]
Ayo, big vibe get the big dog cheddar
Yo, all over the world we move like hot steppa
Bigging up the dappas and all the gun clappas
And all the rude boys who be punanny slappas
All of my hustlas, my hard knockas
Yo, even the bustas, though they cockblockas
Girls by the cluster, all looking proper
Special dedication to you from don dada
Red-1 holla all over the world for the dolla
For the big dog Rottwilder with no colla
For street dog gone corners, them night crawlas
For the doctors and lawyers, them tight scholars
For the trader and evaders, you know the haters
Big it up, your negativity helped made us
Spit it on the track like (wooooooowaaaaa)
You soon to be back but there they go

[Barrington Levy]
In Paris, they want it
And I'm gonna be there
I hear Indes calling
And I'm gonna be there
In Japan, they're crying
And I'm gonna be there, spreading the vibe
All over the world
Oh yeah, so say, night and day

[Jahfus]

[Barryington Levy]
Mother Africa wants me
And we're gonna be there
London City's calling (just the vibes)
And I'm gonna be there
West Indes love we
And we're gonna be there, spreading the vibe
All over

[Misfit]
This is the message in the bottle, now
Coming full throttle, now
All over the world, raise your muzzle lick a shot, now
Feel the vibe and strive bad man a no walk we glide
Now sit up and let the bigshot fly
(Fire it up!)
You see a chap, mush your thought
Every get, part of this style
We pull the roof down 'til it's clear
And shit is hotter than a nympho with no dildo
Reaching for my shit to break her of a piece yo
That high noon talk, gun finga bust
You're laid in chalk, wrap 'em up
Scalp 'em with the mic and the tomahawk
Who dem stalk, number upon the chart
You're with the Jahfus, Big Jude lead the way
Lift up your rocks, show off your stock
Do the bullet dance 'til you hip hop prey or the beat stop
And that's the truth, me and my crew up in the booth
We going to blaze it this year, we gon' never lose

[Barryington Levy]
Tell them already, we have to tell them again
Warn them already, we have to warn them again
Tell them already, we have to tell them again
Tell them already, we have to tell them again

In New York they wants me
And I'm gonna be there
Van-city's calling
And I'm gonna be there
In T-Dot, they wants me
And I'm gonna be there, spreading the vibes
All over the world
Brazil I hear you calling

*Barryington Levy Ad-libs*

Yeah, yeah
The vibe is so right
