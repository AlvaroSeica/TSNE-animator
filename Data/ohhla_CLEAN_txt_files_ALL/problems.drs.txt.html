looking sleek, I went to check the little one - all's well. 
Put up the tools and clips,; did a few pulls and dips; needin a
shower, 
smack my baby-girl on the hip. I'm on the move kid, I'll 
catch you bout seven; shit, showered and strapped and now I got
my 
engine revin'. Supereior handling - still got money left from 
gambling with these kids that I met through these southern joints be 
scramblin'. Turbo-boost, driving at exorbitant speeds; I 
proceed to roll a phil cause I can drive with my knees. The way I
lay it 
down, please, bring new meaning to squeeze - Let my mind 
coast from ki's to dungarees to Gee's Loose ones and tons of fiends
on 
the Hip-Hop scene, but what was once a guillotines', 
semi-auto sub machine - I dream elaborate - though it's gettin
badder it 
doesn't matter yet......livin life as we imagined it 

HEY, WHAT'S WRONG WITH THE WORLD TODAY /
BROTHERS BE BUSTIN BROTHERS FOR 
LESS THAN TIME OF DAY 
FOR PAY / I'D LIKE TO CHANGE THE WAY THE
CHILDREN PLAY AND TEACH THE 
WORLD A BETTER WAY 

Said I was coolin, puffin La; I heard a knock at the door, and when
I 
opened, yo, you couldn't guess what I saw - It was the body 
of this kid in my life I never seen, on the ground, shorty didn't even 
look 16. Must've took it to go cause I ain't even hear the 
sound - Pulled him in from the hall with wifey holdin me down - He 
looked dead at a glance, then his eyes did a dance, and he 
spoke to me while my lady called the ambulance - Told me "Listen
to the 
words when a wise man speaks, many men search the 
world and never find what they seek" - On the verge of tears,
looking at 
what's left of his chest....My girl came, wiped his head 
while I had a towel pressed on his torso - moreso than not he's
gonna 
die, but I'm tellin him he'll be okay, I gotta lie - It's this 
thing called life so many times we take for granted - I hit the La, 
search deep, and try my best to understand it HOOK The final 
minutes, seconds penetrate my days like a knife....To us all the
promise 
death, I bring the promise of life - In my mind I see the 
time as my eyes see the truth - I see the setting of the sun inside the 
eyes of the youth.....As I travel God's creation hoping still 
to see the sight that give meaning to the splendor of a sunrises light -

I disappear in the night to be absorbed in the black - to 
stack up all of the facts, so when I countereact - a full pack - fully 
auto, razor like a laser bear - silent but deadly the theme - you 
might envy the team, for the wealth, loving God is only good for
your 
health - as for mine - hope to say in time the same for 
yourself - you're nice - I be just as....too live to debate - I rock the 
rugged rhymes that bust ass.....keep food on my plate Just a 
quarter of the calliber a brother contains and I'm not playing a game
- 
One Love, and one aim HOOK </pre>
