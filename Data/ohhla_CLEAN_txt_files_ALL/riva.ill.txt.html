[Chorus: HR]
We Rally round the I
I will never wonder why
Nor will we say goodbye
That's why we rally round the I

[Ill Bill]
Life's a battle of the network stars, it's unraveled, I'm mentally scarred
I gambled on my destiny's cards
Acapulco gold, brews of Colt,fuse behold, youth unfold
Funeral ahead of me, homes, I steadily groan
My heavenly soul control the deadliest chrome
But the life of a child is what God blessed me to mould
This is something I put before everything, every thought
Every bit of energy is focused on her every need
I don't give a fuck how gangster you think you are
When you witness the birth of your first child it hits hard
Speaking for myself I'm still speechless
But I owe it to her to put this into words
In case I'm not here when she peeps this
God forbid, I plan to be here until a hundred and five
Until my great grandchildren are alive
Till they listen to this rhyme and wonder why
We rally round the I
And so we never say goodbye, baby girl it's for you, Riva

[Chorus 2: HR]
I want you to love me
I never ever worry
It doesn't matter anymore (no more)
It's time for us to rally round the I
Let's rally round the I
Rally round the I
We'll rally round the I

[Ill Bill]
We named you after my mother's mother
She raised me now we raise you
When I look at you, praise due
Thank God for this beautiful life
Now everything makes sense, thank God for my beautiful wife
In Hindu, Riva's a singer, a beautiful voice
We could've stopped right there, what a beautiful choice
In Hebrew it means "joy", in Arabic it means "hope"
In Latin it means "queen", in Yiddish it means "rose"
To me it means kick down doors with four-fours
If grandma was still here she'd have given me the chrome
I don't rhyme for me no more, I grind for her
I don't live for me no more, I die for her
Human rights, we bringing the truth to the light
Bring the youth to the fight while we shoot through the night
This is dedicated to my wife and my baby girl
Riva May Braunstein, I give you my whole world
I love you

[Chorus 1: HR]</pre>
