[Wattstax Intro]
Ladies and gentleman . . . right about now
You'll see a side of life, that you've never seen before

Yo yo yo yo yo
Unh Unh

[CHORUS]
It's the M-DOT-A-N-I-F-E-S-T
M.anifest M.anifest M.anifest Destiny
It's the M-DOT-A-N-I-F-E-S-T
It go M.anifest M.anifest M.anifest Destiny
It's the M-DOT-A-N-I-F-E-S-T
It go M.anifest M.anifest M.anifest
It's the M-DOT-A-N-I-F-E-S-T

[INTRO]
Let it breathe for a second
You know, Music always needing illumination for every soul today
That's what M.anifest stand for
Four Shades is the movement
Representing live from Ghana, West Africa
You now rockin' with the best
if you ain't got the name right
It's the M-DOT-A-N-I-F-E-S-T

[VERSE]
Yo, check, Yo 
Simpletons don't check for the rhyme they dig the rhythm 
I swagga raps on these tracks embed wisdom 
My mission, seduce with a smooth composition
Bait them with my hooks like Yeah dog I'm fishin
Ain't with all the dissin But I can and will chalk 
These lines to bodybag all competition 
They say I'm sick Ain't no remedy or medicine 
On the mic I spark the light like I'm Edison
Tell me who's better than this Soon to be veteran
Host of the late night some might call Letterman
Mama raised a gentleman but the beast within 
Unleashed is Ludacris I'm disturbin' tha peace
What's the meaning of beef? 
I wanna make dough without the yeast 
Expose misdeeds my Pelican Brief
Black child origin Accra 
Represent Africa with a spectacular street vernacular
Proverbs in particular my main vehicular to the listener 
Backdrop, a beat that's sinister 
A must when I bust yo, I gotta be lyrical
4Shades is the movement we keepin' it spiritual</pre>
