Song:   Great Expectations
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Yeah, I'm ready, yeah

They wan't me to fall
They wanna see if I make it
With my back against the wall, put my head to the sky
No, I won't let 'em break me
I got great expectations
Great expectations
(I'm ready)

All the stares
And all the glares
They waitin' on him
And all the weight
From all the hate
It's gainin' on him
The intensity as he rises
Nobody can disguise it
It's like he got fire in his eyelids
The crowd is roarin'
It's so enormous, his blood is boilin'
His head is burnin', he's focused
He wishes they ignore 'em
Who in they right mind
Want to let his light shine
He ain't even in his prime
Pressure of a lifetime
He standing steady, hands sweaty
Maybe nervous, but ready
The skepticism lies heavy
He's bout to make it ready
He got his fam on his back
Bout to carry like Chevy
So much on his plate
He hopes the repercussions ain't deadly
But he ain't gonna back down
For what he faces right now
And he knows that he will outstand every
Doubt and turn around
The inceptions are knocked out
There will no longer will be doubt
He hears them boo but he won't stop til his name is what they shout

They wan't me to fall
They wanna see if I make it
Got my back against the wall, put my head to the sky
No, I won't let 'em break me
I got great expectations
Great expectations
(I'm ready)

He's no longer fearing
He's swervin' past 'em and persevering
The way he's staring is clearing
All that could be competition
Immediate intuition is winnin'
He's never slippin'
Been hearin' them sayin' that he could be the best that ever did it
Their expectations lie high
So he's just prayin'
Can I be the best man I could ever be to exceed everything they want me to be
No anxiety, just gonna do me and always proceed for the ones that believe
In the young man that's dedicated with a potential to achieve
So I'ma keep goin', keep flowin', keep knowin'
I'm the dopest
My rhymes are potent
But I'ma need you to know it
I know where I came from but I stay so hungry and focused
Like I was focusin and wasn't million in one of the closest
Great expectations I got em waiting and anticipatin'
They all debatin' on if he's hype or will he be stayin'
So now I'm sayin', I'm reachin' to be one of the greatest
So if you hate it take it cause I won't stop even when I make it

They wan't me to fall
They wanna see if I make it
Got my back against the wall, put my head to the sky
No, I won't let'em break me
I got great expectations
Great expectations
(I'm ready, I'm ready)

Staring in the heaven with my headphones on
I can see it in my eyes and know
That I'm the one they have been waiting for
I know my dreams are waiting for me
And looking down ain't the way to go, noooo

(Follow your dreams, follow your dreams we got great expectations)

Not til' they screamin' my name, yeah [x2]
I ain't gonna give up the game, yeah [x3]
Not til' they screamin' my name, yeah [x2]
I ain't gonna give up the game [x3]</pre>
