[Suede]
Yo, Yo, Yo, Yo, Yo
Asian off the sky dive
Blend the seven whirlpools
Cambodian blow fly
Slip into this night ooze
Two pleasures amize a visa
My swordfish select moves
Jumping through the land across
Collect when the Vette fuse
Polynesian breathing
Suede hit burn the catacombs
She sniffing golden grams
For stolen moments
When the rain hit home
Spiral ice steps, see-through sofas
Ice cream mountain
Raspberry ways
She's 20-20 blind cherry glaze

[Cheeba]
They kiss
They kiss the lower cabinet
We got the chrome of
These electric bolts
Freeze a thousand molotov
Cocktails and reheat
Breeze like they was dreaming of
Crazy horse crooks
The scary dashing and lashing dames
Name, marijuana Edali Lam
School bus dive into a pool of wise guys
But, keep rechargeable women
We charging for live cuts
Heavens and herams, and the Suede
Now all is here

[Chorus]
Asia to Africa (Africa)
The young boys they wanna rush (they wanna rush)
Another cut from the Warriors (the Warriors)
We stay victorious (stay victorious)
{Repeat}

[Suede]
There is twilight
My life you like we light is getting brighter
Twin deep unique we screeching
Bleakers out a speeding Viper
Sexy Lex we blessed for days
While you crawl on my spider
Hypnotic, exotic subtonic
We fuzzy navel

[Cheeba]
We on channel matrix
Mate chicks that dominate
We skinny dive the divas
With zebra tommy heaters
On any line you leave us
Lo appropriate
Leave flash, pizzazz
A far bizarre
But naw, the blast magic fantasies
Speed off in the T-top
Where we got the mean lead

[Suede]
We the meal nova getting friction
Aqua, Libra dance forbidden
Tuscan villa Buddha satin
European cocoa Latin
Make the measure off living
Yamaha moto kendo glisten
Mink pattern diamond furs
Cocaine jazz sushi chills
Greasy spoon white hugo
Bowling bags thats where we go
Rolling jacks thats when you go
Holding max you don't hit those
Slim Fast oasis sim city
For them diesel dykes
Laying in tomato sauce
Dragging it on they rag pipes

[Cheeba]
Breathtaking
Heliport we taking off
Heavy golfing endeavours deflating
Mazerati we gone
Ire party be drawn
We out our bodies
Cheeba land by sea by air
We quantum leaping through
Thailand, Beijing, tight ends
We are LO-ah
Cobraca, Asia to Africa

[Chorus] x2</pre>
