It's a juggalo party
Every Hallowicked!!
Put yo' axe up
Every Hallowicked!!
It's a juggalo party
Every Hallowicked!!
Put yo' axe up
Every Hallowicked!!
It's a juggalo party
Every Hallowicked!!
Put yo' axe up
Every Hallowicked!!
It's a juggalo party
Every Hallowicked!!
Put yo' axe up
Every Hallowicked!!

I love the way the leaves turn orange
And pumpkins seem to be on each and everybody's porch
But bitch, it's Halloween, I'm tryin' to raise the dead
And anybody disagree can catch an axe in they forehead
Bitch, fuck Halloween, it's Hallowicked
It's like a Live-Aid all on the stage for real killas
Is you wit' us?
Then keep yo' axe held high
'Cause trick-or-treatin's for fags bitch, we wanna die
I can't afford a costume so I came as self
All high and sweaty, just a picture of health
Trick-or-treat, bag snatchin' ain't shit for the bitch
Run these Pay Day's, Almond Joys, and barbecue potato chips
No more knockin' on the door
We moshin' on the floor and shit
And we ain't leavin' till we heavin' up some blood and shit
Fuck a mothafuckin' Twix, bitch
I'd rather roll with the clique of lunatics
That's now known as TWIZTID!!

Tell me do you want the wicked shit?
HELL YEAH!!
Tell me do you want the wicked shit?
HELL YEAH!!
Tell me do you want the wicked shit?
HELL YEAH!!
Wicked shit!
HELL YEAH!!
Wicked shit!
HELL YEAH!!
Tell me do you want the wicked shit?
HELL YEAH!!
Tell me do you want the wicked shit?
HELL YEAH!!
Tell me do you want the wicked shit?
HELL YEAH!!
Wicked shit!
HELL YEAH!!
Wicked shit!
HELL YEAH!!

Every Hallowicked, it's another killin' spree
Choppin' people up with the axe for hatin' me
I got a long list to fill
Some bitches and ex-friends
I promise you the bitches'll die before the night ends
I got a Hallowicked blunt to smoke with all of y'all
My name is Blaze, let me introduce you to my chainsaw
What it sound like choppin' your neck
Bullet holes in my chest
Like a straight up vet
I'm the dead body waitin' to stick yo' ass up
And fuck yo' ass up
If you with me, throw yo' hands up
And show your dead homie Blaze how you rock
Hallowicked till infinity, the wicked shit'll never stop
We get this bitch so high that my head is spinnin'
Fuck every jugga-ho is how the fuck I'm feelin'
This is some of that scary, it won't quit
Juggalos, tell me do you want the mothafuckin' wicked shit?

Tell me do you want the wicked shit?
HELL YEAH!!
Tell me do you want the wicked shit?
HELL YEAH!!
Tell me do you want the wicked shit?
HELL YEAH!!
Wicked shit!
HELL YEAH!!
Wicked shit!
HELL YEAH!!
Tell me do you want the wicked shit?
HELL YEAH!!
Tell me do you want the wicked shit?
HELL YEAH!!
Tell me do you want the wicked shit?
HELL YEAH!!
Wicked shit!
HELL YEAH!!
Wicked shit!
HELL YEAH!!

It's my favorite time to haunt the streets
Anybody Killa!!
Snatchin' all yo' goodies and handin' out bloody treats
Fuck a costume, I'm scary enough
Devil's Night, Hallowicked, get yo' axe, raise em' up
I can smell the souls and the spirits
And every Hallowicked when the clouds blow by, I can hear em'
Tellin' me to celebrate the dead for life
And every Hallowicked night
Stab everything in sight
I love it when it rains every Halloween
My nose runnin' like a faucet while I'm steady tryin' to trick-or-treat
Wagglin' my dick at every jack-o-lantern I see
Until your mom gets mad and calls the cops on me
Hallowicked is the only day of the year I get to be myself
Instead of trying to be normal like you or anybody else
Psychopathic in this bitch, you know how we ride
Madrox, Twiztid for life, EASTSIIIIDE!!

Tell me do you want the wicked shit?
HELL YEAH!!
Tell me do you want the wicked shit?
HELL YEAH!!
Tell me do you want the wicked shit?
HELL YEAH!!
Wicked shit!
HELL YEAH!!
Wicked shit!
HELL YEAH!!
Tell me do you want the wicked shit?
HELL YEAH!!
Tell me do you want the wicked shit?
HELL YEAH!!
Tell me do you want the wicked shit?
HELL YEAH!!
Wicked shit!
HELL YEAH!!
Wicked shit!
HELL YEAH!!It's a juggalo party
Every Hallowicked!!

Every Hallowicked!!
It's a juggalo party
