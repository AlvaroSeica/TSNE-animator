[Bret Hart]
Without a doubt
I am the best there is
The best there was
And the best there ever will be
You know it


[Red One]
Yo, we walk the path, ring the bell, best of the best
And we ready to blast, quick, fast, handed the task
Can finish 'em off, at any cost
No rules, just according to laws
Yo, came to win, ain't looking for friends
Just to do what we gotta to be champions
Like stompin' again and again, to defeat
Cause to know victory you gotta know defeat
It's survival of the fittest and we playin' for keeps
Deep in beef, the word on the streets is war
And it's my duty to keep it raw and lay the law
And if they act up, throw 'em in the figure four
Yo, we met with Hart, they tried to play the part
Of the big dogs who don't bark, hear the roar
Red One split 'em up, hit 'em up and make sure
That they don't come around here no more

[Bret Hart]
Without a doubt
I am the best there is
The best there was
And the best there ever will be
You know it

[Misfit]
Yeah, you heard the shit
We hit hard and move intelligent
In the squared circle, like my shadow when it's time to scream at y'all
On that ass, I'm too fast
You're only save outside the ropes
You lost hope, tellin' me you can't cope
Ain't got the skills, so sound the bell, the bout is finished
Hittin' missiles, you can't beat the best, get out the busines
You couldn't pin a cushion with a needle
Your attempts is feeble
I lock a submission make you tap fast in front of these people
In record time, climb the ropes, stand up drop kick
To add insult to injury, make sure you feelin' me
See we, come to entertain and wreck shop
And send a message to you suckers as we stand on top
Don't bite what you can't chew, don't challenge what you can't do
Cause when it comes down to heart, I got the power of two
Pumpin' adrenaline, shit kicker, known veteran
Stompin' my comp', at any grudge match, I'll make 'em try again
That's my motto, you better all play in the lotto
'Cause steppin' to my title, boy you end up broke and sorrow
So practisce today, come back years from tommorrow
And I'll be at the top waitin', just to let you know that

[Bret Hart]
Without a doubt
I am the best there is
The best there was
And the best there ever will be
You know it

[Red One/Misfit]
Yo, we break backs
Don't take crap, when we face that
Ring the bell, ready for war, watch how we lay that
Who that flat on the mat, three taps
Head bangin' with the full body contact
Yo, we break backs
Don't take crap, when we face that
Ring the bell, ready for war, watch how we lay that
Who that flat on the mat, three taps
Head bangin' with the Hitman on tracks

[Red One]
Get rowdy, go buckwild, show how we
Stamina rocks, even though the lungs' cloudy
Still first place, gold belt 'round the waist
Tag team champs, here to deal wit' ya case

[Misfit]
Yeah, best of the best
No arguments, I put it to rest
Step into the ring, you pick up your chest
When it comes time to flex, you ain't got nothing left
No game, no fame, no name, just left a torn mess

[Red One]
So I suggest, that you watch your step
Watch your talk, watch who you disrespect

[Misfit]
And watch who you team with, 'cause you'll need it
I'll beat that ass down for any given reason

[Bret Hart]
Without a doubt
I am the best there is
The best there was
And the best there ever will be
You know it

[Red One/Misfit]
Yo, we break backs
Don't take crap, when we face that
Ring the bell, ready for war, watch how we lay that
Who that flat on the mat, three taps
Head bangin' with the full body contact
Yo, we break backs
Don't take crap, when we face that
Ring the bell, ready for war, watch how we lay that
Who that flat on the mat, three taps
Head bangin' with the Hitman on tracks</pre>
