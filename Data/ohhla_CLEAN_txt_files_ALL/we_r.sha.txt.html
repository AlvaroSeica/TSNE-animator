Molemen...
Yeah, S-Double.. sweet sound
Street scholar Shabaam Sahdeeq

[Bronze K]
I'm tryna, lay it down with the 'caine
And the jays, blowin trees, bound it in James
Two guns, a gauge, and a pound
Brave niggaz get laid on the ground,
and when your soul start to rise I'ma pop it to clouds
Bronze, Drift, and S-Double, apocalypse now
Hit producers with assignments, put my verses in vows
You be a passenger in a hearse, you copy my style
Lock shit down, like the cops over on Leonard &amp; Powell
The kid is a mess, hoes be lovin the sex
Condom bust, now a ho get a percent of my check
Never trust hoes, rarely tell 'em my name
And the ones that do know me, they be yellin my name
I play strips, lookin devilish, with a hell of a chain
J-Swiss they see me sell shit I'm true to the game
Spit dimes out my mouth, fuck hand to hand
Swan's out GCT, O.G.'s the clown route
Certain niggaz ain't made for the street shit
I eat meat, vegetarians ain't made for beef shit

[Chorus]

[Over Chorus]
The type of cats who be swervin in the nine up in Lanes
The type of cats who be in ya hallway all day like..
The type of niggaz who'll rock witchu even if it's life or death
The type of niggaz who'll hold you down at your final breath

[Drift]
Aiyyo we ruthless nuts, we stealin niggaz coupes and trucks
My peoples shoot shit up, if they boots get scuffed
And we gon' take over the game, so get used to us
I get money and invest, you give your loot to sluts
Leave them coward niggaz dizzy cuz they doubt that I get busy
This ain't no fuckin game, my stomach growlin like a grizzly
Put rounds up in your kidney, and four on your light Caesers
Holdin the right heaters to soak up your wife beaters
Bonin them nice divas, then leave them broads
Cuz as long as my money right, I don't need them broads
Say you got scrilla but I doubt it cuz your Range's is rented
I'm not a killer, but I think he's about to change in a minute
You up in them gay clubs, don't fuck with them fake thugs
Think I'm jokin 'til the burner is touchin your taste buds
Snuffin with straight slugs 'til ya block ducks down
He give 'em 41 shots like them cops uptown, motherfucker

[Chorus]

[Over Chorus]
The type of cats who be swervin in the nine up in Lanes
The type of cats who be in ya hallway all day like..
The type of niggaz who'll rock witchu even if it's life or death
The type of niggaz who'll hold you down at your final breath

[Shabaam Sahdeeq]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Under pressure I turn coals to diamonds, priceless worths
Pass with a smirk, stick you niggaz handlin work
Chains close like I change flows, change zip codes
Chameleon! Adapt to any strip I'm standin on
S-Double, Drift, and Bronze, them niggaz to put ya money on
Street trinity, dump slugs in your infinite
Y'all yappin niggaz killin me, doubtin the force
Y'all haters could never win, cuz we sweepin y'all off
Like stoops, come through in coupes, in flavors like Froot Loops
Guns not for show, these niggaz they do shoot
And my mind flow righteous stars
But I still got artillery, for them cats tryna take me off course
In my truck I take turns like I'm whippin a Porsche
Doin fifty, hottie in the Denalli, just missed me
Where it stay crispy, like fifties, outta the ATM
Yes thou surpassin 'em, it's Redrum
Where I'm from is everywhere, and everywhere is where I'm from
Everybody got a gun, all scramblin gettin ones
Y'all niggaz all sound the same, it's a new era
Act like a bitch, smear ya lipstick and mascara
Tracks get smashed when you put these three soldiers together
See me never, see multiple holes in ya leather
Make ya chest a golf course, when I flame that torch
Bitch niggaz, (Pop, pop pop, pop)

[Chorus]

[Chorus]
We arrrreee...
