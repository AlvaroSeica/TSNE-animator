Greetings - how's that for a formal
introduction which seems quite normal
'Til I push the H-Y-P-E button
Then.. all of a sudden
A change in the format with reckless abandon
Rush the stage and start commandin
the mic, but the mic's not cordless
Mine is, cause I can afford this
type, of mic you like without the cord
that you can't afford cause the Lord
is takin over for the sell-out
Bust the mic 'til your eighteen inch fell out
your bass bottom - now I got 'em
He tried to take it back so I shot him
with a double barrel, semi-automatic shotgun
You say it's weak but you ain't got one
Cause you be frontin witcha fake plastic uzi
YO (yo) you need to save that for Suzy
Chapstick, witcha overhangin fat lip
Plussin out the cracks with the Vaseline grip
So wake up, you need to learn the correct date
I'm the one that get the job done, I'm great
Cooperate with respect
when Tone's in effect, cause I'm in

This is, the non-violent way that I kill
Puttin heads to bed, like NyQuil
Flyin knots, so go fly a kite (true)
High enough to get struck by light-ning
A key is tied to the string
To cause a shock, words that'll sting
from a killer bee, but don't touch the honey
Pockets so fat it's translated means money
and power, and sprayin thoughts like a shower
to blossom and bloom like a flower
But please, don't confuse it with a daisy
I dance even dirtier than Patrick Swayze
So work out, with the number one video
And watch me bust a rhyme on my man Arsenio
Hall Show, I think you should know
I'm Tone with the skintone that seems to glow
like snow, that keeps fallin to the earth
Take your rhymes to the pawn shop, see what they're worth
Nothin, cause your rhymes ain't top notch
So sit back relax and watch, cause I'm in

Now when I'm in effect that means I'm in the mode
to move, cause I never been sued or sold
You see you need to be told
The weak style of rap you're usin, is old
and worn out, that's why you never get a turnout
All you're ever gonna be, is a burnt out MC
You see you'll never be a hero
So listen sweetheart, you need to cut that zero
Like my man Doug said, the opposite is a bug-bed
or a bedbug, so roll out the red rug
or carpet, you need to just park it
Before I use your crown as a target
at the gallery, or a shoot 'em up movie (bang)
The beat is kinda groovy
But is it smooth enough to be selected for the quiet storm?
Yes, because it's soft and warm
So let the storm keep brewin
Now ask yourself, hey Tone whatcha doin?
Eventually, you'll soon come to realize
I keep my eyes on the prize, cause I'm in
