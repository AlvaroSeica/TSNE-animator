[Ke$ha]
Swimming pool, limousines (c'mon let's do it)
C'mon let's cause a scene (c'mon let's do it)
Cigar in the caviar (c'mon let's do it)
Pissin in the Dom Perignon (c'mon let's do it now)
C'mon let's do it
We gonna do it now
C'mon on let's do it
C'mon on let's do this

[Chorus]
Whoa, oah oh ohhh
There's a party at a rich dude's house
Whoa, oah oh ohhh
There's a party at a rich dude's house
If you wanna go, let me know-oh
We're gonna fight 'til we do it right
So let's whoa, oah oh ohhh
Tonight

[Ke$ha]
De-nah-nah-nah nah nah-nah
Da-nah-nah-nah, nah!
No we're not on the list (c'mon let's do it)
No we don't give a {shit} (c'mon let's do it)
Dance 'til your pants come off (c'mon get naked)
Party 'til the break of dawn (c'mon let's do it now)
C'mon let's do it (c'mon c'mon)
C'mon let's do this!!

[Chorus]

[Ke$ha]
Wake up in the front yard - we, don't, care
Wine stain on the sofa - we, don't, care
I threw up in the closet - but I, don't, care
Cause we're young, and we're broke, and I can't, find my coat
And the sun is comin up and oh my God I think I'm still drunk
Whew!!! Where's my coat? Where?!

[Chorus] w/ minor ad libs</pre>
