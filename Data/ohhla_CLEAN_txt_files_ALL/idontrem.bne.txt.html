[Intro]
Super incredible!
The invasion! (Thick &amp; Thin, Thick &amp; Thin)
Super incredible! (Thick &amp; Thin, Thick &amp; Thin)
Super incredible!
Come one, come all (Thick &amp; Thin, Thick &amp; Thin)
C'mon, let's do it
 
[Chorus: Thin C.]
I don't remember - uhh, uhh, uhh (so sexy girl)
Though you're a winner (you're wonderful babe, wonderful babe)
Was it September (tell me) October (tell me) November (tell me)
When I was in ya...
 
[Thin C.]
She walked up to me like it was time to play
That Brazilian butt, I couldn't place her face
She said she remember how my skin taste
How deep my stroke went, how my 12-guage loaded
How her shit exploded, the story unfolded
So I rolled up a blunt for some extra steam
Still scrollin through my mind tryin to remember this queen
Tryin to revisit the scene, is it all for the dream?
Cause I'm a nigga real as in this for a game of tag team
She said but on that night, she only had me
I said "Well is that right? What's your name lady?"
No need to think I'm shady or crazy, to be a freak is my nature
Please don't be insulted
I'm still really tryin to recall it
It's lights camera action when these thugs get to ballin
Every afterparty for the sexy and naughty, clothes get to fallin
 
[Chorus]
 
[Thick C.]
If I could remember, that would be a sin
Cause been so damn, any (chka) I been in
But, I, don't remember (don't remember)
But I remember when I was up in ya
January, February, was it March?
April May (April May) to the day (to the day)
Three on Wednesday (three on Wednesday) four Thursday (four Thursday)
Friday, Saturday, gimme mo', gimme mo'
To the glass, pour the Mo
Pretty legs, shiny lips, Cuban curves
She stepped out, a goddess
But me Thick C., I stay modest
But me Thick C., I stay modest
Step back (step back) took a look (took a look)
She licked her lips and just shook, ahhh
All over her body, it was latte
 
[Chorus]
 
[Thin C.]
I'm flawless when I toss it, run it like a faucet
Fast forward and pause it, somethin like cerebral palsy
Hop on out them drawers babe, Mo Thug party
Headliners on call, daily
And maybe that's why it's kinda hard to even cock a lady
Everybody just dance, c'mon, uhh
C'mon, yeah, dance for me (dance for me)
Uhh, yeah, Thick C.!
 
[Thick C.]
You're simply wonderful baby, you're simply beautiful baby
You're so incredible baby, you're simply drivin me crazy
Can I dance wit'chu baby? Can I touch you baby?
Or did touch ya baby, if I touched ya baby
Can I touch you again?
Can I bring more cause she brought two other friends
Third-eye tripod extended lens, breathe mo' in my hand
Pose for me again, let me see it again
 
[Chorus] Â– 2X
 
[Thin C.]
I don't remember! (uh)</pre>
