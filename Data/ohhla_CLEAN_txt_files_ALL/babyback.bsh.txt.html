[Akon]      Oooh
            Yeah
            And anything that you wanna do, I'll do it
[Baby Bash] Tell me what the world is (Already)
            Tell me what the world is (Already)
            Tell me what the world is (Already)
            Tell me what the world is (Already)
[Akon]      Baby

Chorus: Akon
Don't look no further
Baby I'm back
Yeah
I'm here to cater to you
Anything that you want me to, I'll do it
Cause I'll be your lover
I'll be your best, friend
Tell me what I gotta do
Tell me what I gotta do and I'll do it (Do, for you)

[Baby Bash]
(Verse 1)
Now I'm back in the flesh
Feelin' so blessed
Back in your corner, Suga Suga, don't stress
Forget about the rest
Let's go inside
I'm back in your zone, baby, back in your vibe
Now I can't be denied, I can't lie, I'm on ya
And never, ever wanna say "Sayonara"
Somebody told me that the grass was greener
On the other side, andele, ariba
Never really intended on being a cheater
What I gotta do
To be your keeper
These words comin' out the speaker
Trill love is off the meter

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 2)
I was gone for a minute, but now I'm home
Please forgive me for being a Rolling Stone
Please forgive me, let me polish it up, like chrome
Get off the phone, tell 'em squares to leave you alone
Let me spark your interest
Now there's no more dating on the internet
Cause you already know
How I get it wet
How I keep it softly and I get respect

Pre-Chorus: Baby Bash (Akon)
You don't have to look no further (No)
You dealin' with the whole enchilada (Yeah)
You don't have to look no further (No)
You hotter than a fire starter (Yeah)

Repeat Chorus

[Baby Bash (Akon)]
I was gone for a minute (Oh...)
I was gone for a minute (Oh...)
I was gone for a minute (Oh...)
I was gone for a minute (Oh...)
Now I'm back, let me hit it (Oh...)
Now I'm back, let me hit it (Oh...)
Now I'm back, let me hit it (Oh...)
Now I'm back, let me hit it (Oh...)

Repeat Chorus Twice (with variations)</pre>
