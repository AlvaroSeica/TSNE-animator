Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Yo, this right here, is for all my girlfriends...

Tell me what it is and I gotta do baby for you to be my girlfriend
Ayy girl I know you tryna be that chick on the side you wanna be the only girlfriend
You wanna be the one to say ooh ooh, ohh ohh
The only one I'm bring to home to
So gone tell me what it is you gonna do about me
Caused I can promise you I know what Ima do about you

You wanna hop on the bounce of a ringtone
Get this for your girlfriends
Fellas you need something hot for her ringtone
Get this for your girlfriends
And then for those that be treating they girl wrong
Ima make em my girlfriend
If you don't pay attention what she say about you
Then you bettah pay attention what she say about me

Its 98 degrees blazin hot
I'm at the summertime spot
Y'all ain't gone believe this girl
Bathin tops with them bottoms out the G
Come to the dirty south for
But there's one in particular day
I remember from the bank
She working the drive thru
She said hey boy I bet you don't even remember me
I'm thinking who in the world could forget about you
She she she came here with her girlfriend
And I'm looking at her thinking for so long I wanna take it at you
And we could talk but not really in the way that I know I need to
Girl I done heard you done been thru some things
No explaining I already know
I wanna start by making it clear
That aint gotta thing to do with us

Tell me what it is and I gotta do baby for you to be my girlfriend
Ayy girl I know you tryna be that chick on the side you wanna be the only girlfriend
You wanna be the one to say ooh ooh, ohh ohh
The only one I'm bring to home to
So gone tell me what it is you gonna do about me
Caused I can promise you I know what Ima do about you

Now baby girl let you can see there's soo many out here say they wanna love me
Cause I checking for the girls that'll see us go almost everyday I'ma boss at 15
Best believe I could show ya (everything)
Better then I could tell you come with me

Believe me, man lie women lie
Believe me, girl, Khalil don't!

I know you came here with your girlfriend
And I'm looking at you, oh yeah
Thinking for so long I wanna take it at you
And we could talk but not really in the way that I know I need to
Girl I done heard you done been thru some things
No explaining I already know
I wanna start by making it clear
That aint gotta thing to do with us

Tell me what it is and I gotta do baby for you to be my girlfriend
Ayy girl I know you tryna be that chick on the side you wanna be the only girlfriend
You wanna be the one to say ooh ooh, ohh ohh
The only one I'm bring to home to
So gone tell me what it is you gonna do about me
Caused I can promise you I know what Ima do about you

This is for the girls from the A, to the girls from New Orleans, the girls who ain't never felt love
This will be the name of the song that I have to put on to say I appreciate y'all
You know them girls out West I can't forget
You know I love NY I can't forget
And this will be for every single girl and every single time
I ain't mention y'all but I ain't forget!

Tell me what it is and I gotta do baby for you to be my girlfriend
Ayy girl I know you tryna be that chick on the side you wanna be the only girlfriend
You wanna be the one to say ooh ooh, ohh ohh
The only one I'm bring to home to
So gone tell me what it is you gonna do about me
Caused I can promise you I know what Ima do about you</pre>
