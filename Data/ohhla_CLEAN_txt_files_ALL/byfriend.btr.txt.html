(Snoop Dogg) 
You need a boyfriend and I can be that 
Holla at me 
Hit me on my video chat 
And let me reach out to you and give you feedback 
It's gonna be us till the end so please believe that 
Yeah the world is all ours and the sky's the limit 
And you can be my boo and everything that goes with it 
I can lift you off your feet like a flight attendant 
Imma send this car for ya, is you ridin' in it? 

(Big Time Rush) 
Have you ever had the feeling you're drawn to someone? 
[Yeahh] 
And there isn't anything they could of said or done 
And everyday I see you on your own 
And I can't believe that you're alone 
But I overheard your girls and this is what they said 

Looking for a looking for that your looking for a boyfriend 
I see that, give me time you know I'm gonna be there 
don't be scared to come put your trust in me 
Can't you see all I really want to be is your boyfriend 
Can't fight that let me down you know I'm coming right back 
I don't care at all what you done before all I really want is to be your

Let me take a little moment to find the right words 
[to find the right words] 
so when I kick it you it ain't something that you've heard 
[something that you've heard] 
I don't know what kind of guy that you prefer 
But I know I gotta put myself for worse 
See I think got the kind of love that you deserve and I heard that 

That you're looking for a boyfriend 
I see that, give me time you know I'm gonna be there 
Don't be scared to come put your trust in me 
Can't you see all I really want to be is your boyfriend? 
Can't fight that let me down you know I'm coming right back 
I don't care at all what you done before all I really want is to be your

Your boy boy b-b-b-b-b-boy friend 
Your boy boy b-b-b-b-b-boy 

If you tell me where, I'm waiting here 
Everyday like slum dog millionaire 
Bigger then the Twilight love affair 
I'll be here girl I swear 

(Snoop Dogg) 
So we should down the ride 
Or do I gotta slide 
I know you need a boyfriend 
And I can be the guy 
I help you open up even if you're shy 
She might be the one 
I see it in her eyes 
I see it in her swag 
She be on the fly 
Gucci bag 
Chanel purse 
I need her in my life 
I'm the one for her 
And she's the one for I 
This could be paradise if we do it right
