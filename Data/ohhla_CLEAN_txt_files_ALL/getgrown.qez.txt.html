Song:   Get Grown
Typed by: @QuezThePoet

A daughter and a wife and Lord they're my life
And Lord I sacrifice all so night I grind hard
Whether poem peddler or puncher of time card
I keep it moving til the peddle gives the metal grind scars
And even though the powers that be pull the strings
Like Geppetto, I stay sharp cut the line and fall
Feet hit the floor walk tall on my own accord
Even if it is a brawl to fight through brick walls
I keep my fists balled cupped knuckles crackling
Cause if they got your back they got your back like Bob Backlund
By they I mean the government come behind you grappling
Chicken Wing chock hold cackling
Like hyenas, but through it all we all keep being dreamers
We all look for redeemers whether you believe in Jesus
Or you don't we're all just trying to keep our self esteem up
When the engine gets cold and the temperature can freeze us
Get GrownÂ…

(and get grown)
Handle that shit all on your own and get grown
And get grown
(and get grown)
Sit down young man and grow a pair of stones
And get grown
(and get grown)
Get busy living or get busy dying get grown
And get grown
(and get grown)
Get free get a life get going and get
And get grown
(and get grown)

A wife and daughter, they say my life is over
They say I might as well hang up my mic and move to Florida
Or go to the opera for the fat lady singeth
About a baby blocking dollars and a wife blocking yo penis
(OHHHHHH) well fuck it they can have it all
And if I never ball then I'll just brag bout how I'm raw
On the microphone and make an emcee wet his panties
Call me photosynthesis the way I'm sunning these pansies
(OHHHHHHH) now back to getting grown
Cause maybe I'm the chosen one to spit this shit shalom
Or maybe it's coincidence I'm gifted with the poem
Either or I just keep a keep, keep it on
Like a burqa at a mosque or a yamaka at temple
Just to simply pencil monumental
Well here's an earful a mouthful an eyeful
Be mindful that your better days are not behind you
Get grown and get going

(and get grown)
Handle that shit all on your own and get grown
And get grown
(and get grown)
Sit down young man and grow a pair of stones
And get grown
(and get grown)
Get busy living or get busy dying get grown
And get grown
(and get grown)
Get free get a life get going and get
And get grown
(and get grown)

My wife that's my lady my daughter my baby girl
Hip hop's my bitch if I pimp her to this world
Am I wrong, in this land of sing song
Is she the King Kong forced to be strong
Locked with chains on, shackles from the arms
To the feet is this defeat or should she just keep it on
With them adolescent dreams of getting her free on
Like them days when she was young but since been dethroned
By white men in suits and forced to perform
In ways that she never would have if she was home
In ways that she never would have is she was grown
Or at least aloud to grown they way she would if she were on
Her own, instead of trademarked branded and owned
She dreams of climbing empire states and she longs
For these chains to break so she can dance and get gone
Cause revolution is her jam and freedom her theme song
She wanna get free and get grown

(and get grown)
Handle that shit all on your own and get grown
And get grown
(and get grown)
Sit down young man and grow a pair of stones
And get grown
(and get grown)
Get busy living or get busy dying get grown
And get grown
(and get grown)
Get free get a life get going and get
And get grown
(and get grown)</pre>
