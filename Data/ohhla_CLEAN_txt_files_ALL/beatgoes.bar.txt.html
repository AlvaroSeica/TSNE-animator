[Intro]
And the beat goes {*2X*}
And-and the beat goes {*2X*}
And-and the beat goes (beat goes on!)
And-and the beat goes {*2X*}
And-and the beat-beat (beat goes on!)

[B-Real]
In the city lights, the night'll give me life
I hear the drums, I'm a war chief, gimme knife
You got kush, fuck the knife, just give me light
Spark it up in my grow room, pretty sight
Got a house on the hill, we the pretty type
You ain't got kush, man what a shitty life
I don't wanna hit your bowl on your mini pipe
Tryin to hit my 8-footer, reach Diddy heights
Now I'm swingin on the drums like Tarzan
Incorporate the weed through my bars man
Sixteen of 'em, I be needin 'em
On stage screamin 'em, PRC{?} screenin 'em
They call green thumb, the serene one
I lay back on the drum like a beach bum
Shit is hot as summer, another classic number
Everybody give it up for the funky drummer

[Chorus]
And the beat goes on (and the beat goes on!)
And the beat goes on and on and on

[Interlude]
And the beat goes on (and the beat goes!)
And-and the beat (beat goes on!)

[Sen Dog]
Here come the West Coasters, whylin out loc'in
My eyeballs bleed from the weed I be smokin
Keep walkin son, I keep this on hostile
Mad weaponry, I bring by the stockpile
Way too deep, my block legendary
Many MC's tried to creep and got buried
Here come the Cypress, back with the tightest
man behind the kit, we know you gon' like this
Roll with the top dog, do it like a rock star
Servin 'em up, a double dose of hot sauce
You got your ears on, and you're listenin
The bad motherfucker is in this here business
Handle shit right, get your stack on
Anybody hatin is that fool that you smash on
Gonna say it last time, and I'm gonna jump
Hit 'em and go bang, give the drummer some!

[Chorus] - repeat 4X

[B-Real]
Shit is critical, we are the invincible
Riot starters start riots on principle
At the pinnacle, the game is winnable
Put the record on the table, guaranteed spinnable
Follow the leader, the level is goin off the meter
The funk freaker, with the big drum beater
What you scared for? Better prepare your-
-self for the time of your life, we are in rare form
The track is harder with Travis Barker
Cause the beat is much bolder than the magic marker
Write it on the wall, y'all wanna see us fall
Small minds get the balls, see the plaques down the hall
I'm a self-made, not a Federline
Got my own stacks, that means the cheddar's mine
On forever grind, somethin that you'll never find
The time to do so {?} you will never mind

[Chorus] - repeat 4X
