[Verse 1]
When you look at me, you see something
that I don't even see I ain't even achieve nothing
when I'm with you, you breathe, huffin and puffin and weeze
loving every minute I touch it and tease
Damn it's so intimate for you, but for me what am I supposed to do?
I only pretend that you my girl when we laying horizontal
or you cooking me a meal or you throwing me some dollars
and I know that's not love, see I was introduced to love
it's not 2 nuts after gin and juice it's bugged
I been seduced, I know that's no excuse
but look at how you open girl I wish that I was you
I make your face light up, your bones shiver, your skin twitch
And I just wanna be friends bitch, or maybe I'm scared
with all I went through, girl you was there
if I ain't in some type of love, then I'm probably stuck in care
or lust, or like, or damn tell me how you just
focus on my stupid ass, and tune them others out and plus
you wish I had a kid with you, wish I copped a crib with you
I just keep dissin' you, I'm missin' you I wish I was you

[Chorus]
I wish that I felt the way you feel
It could be a happy ending
But I end where you're beginning
I wish I was you
I wish that I could say that this is real
But inside I'm feeling empty
But you still want to be with me
I wish I was you

[Verse 2]
How can you be attracted to my slackness?
my actions are backwards
I'm macking and acting, you keep coming back
then you yell and you packing
that's when I think, she's finally cracked
but as soon as I blink
you forgive and forget, you were pissed and upset
I'm a dÂ–k I'm a mess, don't you live with regrets?
Am I really the best or did you run out of options?
I don't ever take you shopping, I don't wanna meet your pops
And you be cooking, you be cleaning
I be looking for a reason I could do my thing and leave
but yo the truth is that I need you
girl it's not adding up, how can you be sure its me?
Are you shallow or is that my insecurity?
Do you like how I rap? You know there's more to me?
You want a girl or boy with me? I can't see it
I think you're wonderful, but if I had one to choose
you are not the one for me, I'm sorry I'm the one for you
this whole damn spill is uncomfortable
I'm loving you but I'm not in love with you
when I'm up in you, it feels like I'm into you
but you should really listen to
this song before you land in an institute girl I wish I was you

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
So I could see what it feels like to hurt and be a human being
Not this robot that you're used to seeing
It's the youth in me, the fool in me
Me being cool, all that cool shit is fooling me
there are no rules
to being with somebody when you're ready for it all
Training wheels on, I don't ever wanna fall
I don't want sympathy, I'm telling you I'm wrong
it's better in a song, or maybe not
I don't want you to move on and be happy with somebody new
I wanna know if I would love me, if I was you
Egotistical yeah. That is kinda true, but what am I to do? I need help

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Is it because I spit bars? Is that why you're giving me your heart?
And your home, and some brain
girl you damn near the Wizard of Oz I swear I wish I was you
