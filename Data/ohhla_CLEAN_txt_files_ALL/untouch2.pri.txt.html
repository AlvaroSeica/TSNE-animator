[Verse One - Princess Superstar]
I got King Kong playin Ping-Pong with a big bong
In my brainstorm and the pains warm
Swarm like smog in Hong Kong I know it's wrong
But I kill me softly with my own song
Some magic wand could make it be ok kill the decay
Like a cake and a lay
But today- it wasn't a good day
And you can't touch me I've already faded, I faded away

[Hook - Beth Orton]
Sometimes I wear nothing on the outside
Because there's too much on the inside
The bouncer wouldn't let me in
He said my emotions were too close to the skin
And at this point a touch would feel like a cut

[Verse Two - Princess Superstar]
Turn me off, just turn it off
I'm off base off face when I think I lace I cough mace
I could go on for days but then I always complain
A waste of breath and a name
I aim and I maim and I came here to choose
But when I look around me, compare me and lose
Payin dues feelin blues got no clues
And it's all news to you, huh

I keep it so undercover I could be a mattress
And it matches the patchy ashes my brain crashes
This address, I hope I move from it from summit to plummet
I covet release and it's comin
Untouchable it ain't discussible
I'm disgustable in a vestibule must a pulled a musclefull in my head

I bet I get better but better remember I waited forever
Fuck Princess I'm talkin 'bout Concetta you never met her
It kind of appears my ego account's in arrears
Fear, tore up and teared with wet tears
I feel weird and I wish it was easy to ask you to come here
Sometimes I'm happy when I see the sun one day I'll say I've won
And if you think this song is done there's Untouchable Part 1</pre>
