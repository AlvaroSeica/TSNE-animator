Lies we do despise
That's why we tell the truth, we never compromise
Lies are the root of all evil
Stop bullsh[edited], tell the truth to the people

You're lyin
You're lyin
Lies, lies

You might lie to me - I won't lie to you
Act like you don't know me, tell 'em babe, brand new
What's yours is yours - And what's mine is mine
But every time you're on the mic you're always bitin my rhyme
Tellin them stories like you're my friend
But then you go behind my back and tell a lie again
You lie to your father, you lie to your mother
You lie to your sister - Then you lie to your brother
You lie so much that the truth ain't in ya
I gotta tell a lie myself just to try to defend ya
You lie all night talkin on the phone
Tell lies in your mirror when you're home alone
You lie to the people livin next door
Cause the lady upstairs don't wanna hear it no more
You lie so much you probably think it's the truth
Must be Cinderella cause the shoe fits you

Don't lie to me
Who she think she talkin to?
Ain't nobody gon' believe that s[edited]
I know, she always comin up with some bugged out story
Yo, yo here come that lyin [edited] Righteous
Yo, what up with him?
Yo peace y'all, y'all ain't gon' shoot me no rhythm?
Haha
He

Lies we do despise
That's why we tell the truth, we never compromise
Lies are the root of all evil
Stop bullsh[edited], tell the truth to the people

You're lyin
You're lyin
Lies, lies

Lies people tell to conceal certain things
They say it's an act of any human being
There're small lies, big lies, bugged out and wack lies
In yo face and behind your back
There's white lies, black lies, purple and green lies
On the radio and on the TV screen
He has everyone's attention, her name he never mentions
As he tells us how he had her in disposition
It's why they have lawyers, the top chief liar
The more they lie, their fee gets higher
My girl even lies ( ? )
They even told me the ( ? ) got bigger
Should I believe they're just tryina deceive
This girl even said she was pregant by me
Always givin up her body to me and everybody
Now the father of her baby is me, [Name] and Tommy

Lies we do despise
That's why we tell the truth, we never compromise
Lies are the root of all evil
Stop bullsh[edited], tell the truth to the people

You're lyin
You're lyin
Lies, lies

Yo word, I was kickin it to that [edited]
Cause yo, I had all the girls on my tip, man
They were sweatin me, man, I needed a towel
Right, all them mutt dogs
Especially the baldheaded one with no teeth
Yo, what's up with that, Righteous?
Baldheaded with no teeth?
Y'all what's up with that, y'all know that girl was fly

Lies, lies, I'm talkin 'bout fly
That brother had it good but all he did was lie
It started as a little, there couldn't be a lot
Now he's tellin all the fellas that I'm on his jock
Knowin I just met him he wanted me to sweat him
He'll love me if I let him, if I wanted I could get him
And from the beginning he started actin ill
Said his name was Darren and I heard that it was Bill
Now it was gettin worse, he lied about his age
Told me he was 20 and ( ? )
I asked him did he smoke, he said: Nah, I never puff
Caught him with some cheeba, about to dog his stuff
I was chillin down the ave in my leather gear
I heard my homegirl yell: Yo [Name] come here
Guess who I saw around the block
Pimpin down the street imitatin the Doc
He said this girl under his arms with a big fat grin
You know he only lies sayin: We're just friends
Why should I sweat it, it's not my loss
Cause that's a girl who gives it up like the Red Cross
We walked up to her, she didn't know what to do
She just started mumblin how she's down with the crew
Her eyes got big, her mouth just dropped
Cause all the time I know she's on my [edited]'s jock
My homegirls warned me that you wasn't fly
Crawl under a rock and muthaf[edited] just die
