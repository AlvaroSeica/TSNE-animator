Snoop Dogg (Q-Tip):

I put it down for the L.B.C.
(I put it down for a place called Queens)
You know I represent the 213
(I hold it down for the big city)
I keep it gangsta for all my young g's
(All the P-Y-T's with they own car keys)
I put it down for all the ladies
its all about you

(Raphael Saadiq)
I tried to look the other way
the day you passed me by
I saw you holding Q-Tip's hand
And girl I nearly died
The way you hold that cosmo
Just fits you to a T
But I just wish that you was sitting
Right next to me
I wonder what was God's mind
The day that he made you
I know he wrote a new commandment
After he was through
But every time I see you 
I find something new
But I just gotta have you

Chorus: repeat 2X

I really want you
I just gotta have you

(Raphael Saadiq)
Me and nephew snoop was eating
At the serving spoon
And my partner Skinny Black
Was sitting with us too
And all of a sudden
Your body was in sight
I couldn't finish breakfast
Now something just ain't right
Now snoop was looking like
"What the hell is wrong with you?"
I said I know you understand
You've been through a few
But this one was special, special to me
Is it my imagination killing me

Chorus: repeat 2X

I really want you
I just gotta have you

[Snoop Dogg]
I can't fake it no more
I can't take it no more
I need you in my life fo' sho
My wife fo' sho
No turnin' back, it's on and crackin'
Pure satisfaction, girls that's what's happenin'

[Q-Tip]
Uh, uh...
I appropriate game, you know my name
Abstract hits when them bad times flip
A man need a lady no matter the kind
A diamond shinning like you, you know it's hard to find

[Snoop Dogg]
Time brings change, and change brings time
My nephew wants you cause you so fine

[Q-tip]
A woman choose a man is a real motif
Make a choice cause me and Ray, we never had beef
Me and Snoop we go hard, real macaronis
Why you think that we want to have a ceremony
Snoop Dogg...

[Snoop Dogg]
There's something special 'bout you baby boo
I need to know right here right now what you really wanna do

Chorus until fade with ad-libs</pre>
