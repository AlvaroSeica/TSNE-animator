Typed by: iamomni dot com

like a song, like a song
made to play, made to play
superstars, superstars
fade away, fade away
holding on, holding on
to yesterday, to yesterday
heroes have, heroes have
a price to pay, a price to pay
hahahahah

[Omni verse - 16 bars]
money out the window, falling out the limo
at your biggest parties with some famous faces everybody's waiting
popping bottles out the cases biggest record in the nation
number one on every station, we made it, hold up check it
taken' trips to foreign countries indulge in exotic woman
unloading the shotty in them, knowing they out to get him
and your music started changing and your face looks like it's aging
in the magazine pages hooked on that medication
the people heard enough of you the drinking's catching up to you
the ladies don't fruck with you your label got a substitute
your spotlights was yesterday your albums in the trashcan
and then you stopped laughing what happened {I should have told him}

like a song, like a song
made to play, made to play
superstars, superstars
fade away, fade away
holding on, holding on
to yesterday, to yesterday
heroes have, heroes have
a price to pay, a price to pay

[Omni verse - 16 bars]
it's hard to sleep at night and I ain't eating right
I sit up and flip the light at my window seat and write
downing shots in my hotel room reading old reviews
he's old news and I can't believe they had him so juice
cheesing, with ah gold tooth what the fruck was you thinking
smiling for the cameras and lip singing, it happened so fast
the fame the women the cash it's gone in a flash
you're a thing of the past
we had fun, made it all the way to number one
feeling like his job was done
poured his last shot of run left this message on his cell phone
and took another bump, climbed up to the balcony and jumped
stupid mufruckah

like a song, like a song
made to play, made to play
superstars, superstars
fade away, fade away
holding on, holding on
to yesterday, to yesterday
heroes have, heroes have
a price to pay, a price to pay

GETTING' THAT MONEYYYYYYYY (REPEATS)</pre>
