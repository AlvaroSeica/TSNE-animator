huh huh
I had to do somethin like dis
ya know
huh I shoulda listened
I shoulda listened

[Lil' Flip - Verse 1]
I shoulda listened, when ya said boy go and get a job
I shoulda listened, cause you gotta sell dope or rob
I shoulda listened, when you told me I need to go to college
but right now I'm tryin to money in my wallet
I shoulda listened, when you said boy make good grades
but instead I was worryin about dem new j's
I shoulda listened, when you said boy dont get no tattoos
now it's 2 years later and now I got 22
I shoulda listened, when you said keep playin basketball
but I was makin mo money standin in the hall
I shoulda listened, when you said I need to be in the church
but that's hard "why" cause everyday I gotta concert
I shoulda listened, when you said I need to watch my friends
cause yesterday my partner got jacked fo' his Benz
I shoulda listened, when you said dont stand on the corner
cause all black folks do is smoke marijuana

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
I shoulda listened, when yo told me dont do that I did it any way
I shoulda listened, when yo told me dont hustle but I gotta get paid

[Lil' Flip - Verse 2]
I shoulda listened, when you said quit standin on the block
cause all that do is make it easy fo the cops
I shoulda listened, when you said it dont matta what car you drive
long as you pay yo bills long as you survive
I shoulda listened, when you said dont be hangin at the club
cause people get drunk and wanna shoot the club up 
I shoulda listened, when you said you cant please everybody
right now I'm findin out I dont need everybody
I shoulda listened, when you said dont brind dem niggaz to ya house
cause when you aint there theyll try to break in ya house
I shoulda listened, when you told me you read what ya so
so everybody I meet I cant treat'em like a hoe
I shoulda listened, when ya told me do somethin wit my time
so I picked up the pen and paper and now I'm writtin ryhmes
I shoulda listened, when you said forget the money put God first
so that's the way I gotta end my verse

[Chorus] - repeat to fade</pre>
