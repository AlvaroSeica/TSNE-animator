[Dragonfly]
See I've been, holding back, taking my time
But now I gotta let it out, man, it's blowing my mind
See, it all started, a whole different era
When beats were doors, and cool niggas smoke whores
Baggy jeans, leather stacks, big hats, with no job
And we like parties, big tax and forty fives
All it took was some funk, watch and observe
And in the parties, this is all you heard
'Excuse me, miss, but see I came to get down
Can I, dance with you and order another round?'
It's my pleasure to provide and produce
So sit back and relax and let my words seduce

[Chorus: Dragonfly]
So won't you, be with the me, and see the 70's
The 80's and the 90's, not yet to see
Let's play make believe, it's 2003
Let's leave in the time machine
Cuz I believe, that you can fly with me
Come on and fly with me
Cuz I believe, that you can fly with me
Come on and fly with me

[Dragonfly]
EZ Widers to Backwoods, uh, let's roll it up
And like my man Axe say, just put a liquor in the cup
This is for the villains, hustlers and pimps
A ladies pizzaz, know how to shake they hips
So can we, hit the lights and spark the first J
It's the cold Don, nigga, with Alize
Party all night til the break of day
Open your ears and hear what I say
It's all about having the gift of gab
And if you want it real bad, let me see what you have

[Chorus]

[Hook 2X: Dragonfly]
Fly with me and just spread ya wings
And look at all the places and things that I've seen</pre>
