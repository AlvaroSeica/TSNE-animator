[Intro: M.O.P. sample]
OHH! (OHH!) OHH! (OHH!) OHH! (OHH!)
OHH! (OHH!) OHH! (OHH!)
YEAH! (YEAH!) YEAH! (YEAH!) YEAH! (YEAH!) YEAH!

[Chorus: Busta Rhymes]
I wanna see you (do that thiiiiing)
Before you all (pass out) pass out!
(Hands up) Hands UP! (Spazz out) Spazz out
Nobody could do it the way we get it done, nah (uh-uh)
We make 'em blow they cash out, cash out
Don't you love it when we come and do it again?
Pour liquor 'til it's fill out the glass (HEY!) non-stop
Peep the way we got it on smaaaaaash (the way we got it on smaaaaash)
We don't stop until it bounce like HOO!
Deh-deh-deh-deh deh-de-de-deh-deh-deh
Deh deh-deh, deh-de-de-deh-deh-deh
Deh-deh-deh-deh deh-de-de-deh-deh-deh
Deh deh-deh, deh-de-deh

[Busta Rhymes]
Can't stop 'til we knock off your block
Mami watch the flyest nigga with it purposely, I sloppily mop
Celebrate this bread, we be gettin Monopoly guap
Several homes in beautiful cities, I property hop
Most you niggaz need to probably stop
Create a lane cause when I come through, most you dudes'll probably flop
When I spit chances'll be shots as I probably pop
Shots legal 'til them nozzles is hot, and blow the spot
Now you know we got it for 'em (I give you the heat)
And we gotta put it on 'em (we feedin the street)
Let's go~! "Avatar" shit, I'm lost in the zone
Might as well give me the crown bitch, I'm bringin it home
Tired as hell, you hear the sound bitch, I'm standin alone
See I be lockin the town until they bandage your bones
While you niggaz quick to black and love the shit that we bring
Bust bottles and salute what's legendary

[Chorus]

[Busta Rhymes]
I'm comin and killin and causin you niggaz to lose it
While I massacre challengers, line 'em up smackin 'em stupid
Assault and battery the booth boy, I love to abuse it
You see the high beam when I'm comin muh'fucker, MOVE IT!
And so I say - you know we got that shit
then give it to 'em 'til we make a nigga say WE GOT IT BITCH!
And uhh - we don't stop; and uhh - we don't quit
And uhh - you see most flip because we drop the most hits
I know for most it's hard to just stomach
God of the spit in the flesh and what he do to become it
I step in the building, demolish shit, you know how I got it
The way I mash on e'rything you know how I run it
My $150,000 features swallow your budget (WHAT!!)
And fuck the hood up boy, you see how they love it
While you niggaz quick to black and love the SHIT that we bring
Bust bottles and salute what's legendary

[Chorus]

[Outro: M.O.P. sample]
OHH! (OHH!) OHH! (OHH!) OHH! (OHH!) OHH! (OHH!)
OHH! (OHH!) OHH! (OHH!)
YEAH! (YEAH!) YEAH! (YEAH!) YEAH! (YEAH!) YEAH!</pre>
