RISE UP! *2X*

[Xzibit]
Yeah, uh huh
Bliss N Eso, Mr. X to the motherfucking Z
Broadcasting live, listen

I get up, I get out, getting it in, getting it in
I'ma win, tell these motherfuckers again, I'ma win
Till my death, till my very last breath, till my very last step
on this planet, goddamn it I'ma win
Mr. X to the Z, give us free or get hurt
It ain't worth risking your life, I'll plant your ass in the dirt
Taking off (taking off), rising up (rising up)
Give a fuck, whatever, whoever, we fucking you up
I'm losing touch with reality, so let's skip the formalities
and get down to the business, Bliss N Eso is my family
So we move like the military and bury the bullshit
The congregation is growing, I preach from the pulpit
In Syd' city with Aussie chicks with huge titties
I'm not kidding, copping a squat and start shitting
on each and every one of you motherfuckers who want it
Check, damn it feels good to see people up on it

[Chorus: 4X]
"Damn it feels good to see people up on it
 People up on it, people up on it" - Biz Markie

[Eso]
I get up, I get out, getting it in, getting it in
Give these gorillas a grand entrance, we're playing to win
This is worldwide warriors that kick-start the stampede
We bring it back and let Biz Mark' the damn beat
They try to tell me that I couldn't have a dream
Now I'm knocking 'em and boxing 'em like I was Danny Green
Plotting with a battle axe under the mill
"Chopping heads" Making motherfuckers run for the hills
Yo, I've come for the kill, time's up, rise up
And anyone in our way can take a whiff of my nuts
I got kush in the bush, banging beats till the shack's shook
and X is rolling blunts out a pack of Backwoods
I'm that good sweetie, seven days on this earth
Fuck, watch me bloody making a verse
It's like my life is a movie and I'm a kid in the comic
Yo, damn it feels good to see people up on it

[Chorus: 4X]

[Xzibit]
You can run, you can hide
You can live, you can die
Put up your hands, rise up with me
And if you knew what I know, it would show
But you don't, so let's go
Now let me show you what my eyes can see, yeah
You can run, you can hide
You can live, you can die
Put up your hands, rise up with me
And if you knew what I know, it would show
But you don't, so let's go
Now let me show you what my eyes can see
Come ride with me (yeah)
Come fly with me (huh)
Come ride with me (yeah)
Come fly with me
Come ride with me

[Bliss]
I get up, I get out, move +At the Speed of Life+ for certain
The revolution's brewing man, you should see behind the curtain
I paint it picture-perfect, jotting the grammar
Rocking this banger as I hit the circuit, dropping a hammer
Yeah, it's hella major man, we win the bout and celebrate her
It's the next level rebels in and out of elevators
My whirlwind fill the valley of the vortex
Twenty-eight thousand strong rallied at your doorstep
So rise up man, we're holding up the common kids
It's the hang-glider rider rolling off a monster cliff
Taking flight with my chosen flock of congregates
Known to drop the bombs a bit and boulder hop the continents
On the roller coaster going over the Pacific
Sunset strip, vivid, rolling doja with Xzibit
Aim for the stars, it's the kid who rides comets
Damn it feels good to see people up on it

[Chorus: 4X]</pre>
