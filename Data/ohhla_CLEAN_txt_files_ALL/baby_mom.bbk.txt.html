she baby momma material
she baby momma material
she baby momma material
she baby momma material

I seen one day
in the afternoon
about 3:30 in the
month of june

she had her nails done
and her hair done too
she was all by herself
she didn't need no group

I mean real nice girl
got nothing to prove
but walk around like she
something to lose

shish if I hit she
won't give me the digits
cause she don't wanna
get to personal

new york swagger
but she live in philly
go to school in rhode island
her daddy work for the city

she look like minnie
a look like mickey
damn it's crazy
how this girl look wit me

all that and don't
know her name
shorty what it is
she said jane

do you like balling
come get up on this game
and eversince then
she been on my brain

(chorus)

she baby momma material
she baby momma material
she baby momma material
she baby momma material

(break)

no need to look no further
wit me you have no drama
i'll been your baby father
you be my baby momma

(2nd verse)

damn now back to the story
I looked at her ass
and shorty
caught me

no need for disrespect
but my thoughts is naughty
and by nature my
eyes adore thee

attitude of a young beauty
strong female
who knew
her duty

wanna come over
we can watch a movie
and better yet
we can make a few  movies

she came and I came
and she left then I left
had to keep it g rated
shorty was a vet.eran

and bet. ter than
all of those
in the air wit they
nose

never seen her
once more
that's the way love
goes

(chorus)
