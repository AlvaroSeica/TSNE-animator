[Krayzie]
We thuggish ruggish niggas always, always,
and ready to bring the war up your way, if you hate
Look into my eyes and tell me what it is you see in me
Would you look into my eyes?
Look into my eyes and tell me what it is you see in me
Could you tell me what you see?

[Bizzy]
Comin' through the door with my militia, wanna be brief, big niggas 
Fuck y'all, with a gang of bodyguards
My niggas is stone cold killas, peelas
Pimpin' out the limos, the bitch soldiers maintain
Givin' my babies all of my money, but my diamonds steady be shinin'
My gang, you know me. Homies got mo' love
And I'm blessed when I'm out of my senses
Pump my fist to Mo Thug, gotta keep the Lord up over my shoulders
Jesus, sent me his roller, loco, sober, load a revolver, hold 'em down
Buck 'em all to hell, cause I'm sho'nuff
And I seen that the bullet holes was too much, your luck
Ya get blowed up, all of you niggas goes out
The surgeons say that your body can not be sewed up
Hold up, and wait a minute
It's time for Bone Thugs, 'cause y'all think that you can really hate, nigga

Chorus

[Krayzie]
What makes a nigga think he can bite my shit and call his shit original? 
What's worse, tellin' people you made the style we put down three fuckin years ago
And that's just like a nigga wanna take all the credit
I bet it didn't even occur that we would eventually meet with ya, kid
Don't crash, collide, lock up with the enemy
And I don't wanna say a nigga's name and all that
But, uh, y'all fin to get scarred, woof, let 'em loose
And they heard the news, ya run up, ya could get dead, oh
Uh-huh, hey, we murder muthafuckas in a deadly way - 
Fully automatic when I let 'em play
"Aw shit! Get down, Leatherface" 
Fuck 'em all, if I can't get my respect
Come on, now, put them to rest, rest
What a bloody, bloody mess, but nevertheless, we won't stress
I figured this platinum got you actin' like you got to be me
It's all in your mind, but in time, you'll find we as real as we speak

Chorus

[Layzie]
All I see is this soldier, pistol in holster, givin' you the most
I toast to them thugs
Nigga, nothin' but the love of bud that we brought to the table
And a nigga wanna test, catch slugs, put 'em in the mud
Harmony smooth with the thug shit, mo murda to the fools that clone
Five niggas loc'd out with the roughness, nigga
And it's war when you crap these Bones, we can get it on
And I'm referrin' to all of y'all bitches
Y'all know who you are when y'all tried that
Rollin' with the E since ninety-three, shut 
shit down in the industry, nigga, can you bite that? 
I know y'all niggas wanna roll with pros, and make friend of foes
But we chosen - God done blessed us with His potion
pure devotion, freely spoken, baby
Niggas can't see us never, stay together, my click too clever
Ride through the days of the stormy weather
Remember: eternal, it means for everlastin'
#1 Assassin blastin', bashin' on all you niggas wrong-doin's
All of the heavens gonna be ruined, trues, when he come
We won't be losin', provin' 'em wrong

Chorus

[Wish]
I see five killa realer niggas ready, roll wherever I go
True to put it to this mother, nigga, put 'em in a river
We the killas, and that's for sure
Niggas out there clownin' mine, you can't rhyme, the style you got is all mine
And when I see you, bitch, jump on your pockets double time
And it's like that, you don't want that
Come and get some pap, pap. Wanna sound like? 
Wanna be like, uh, nigga we can't have that
Why a nigga wanna bite the Bone shit? Platinum raps
Nigga bet that bitin' shit ain't doin' nothin', tryin' to make somethin' 
outta nothin'
Fuck it, let's peel caps, buck 'em all down
Put 'em in check, fuck 'em up with the 44 mag, I'm glad
'cause when you're fuckin' with Bone, we sendin' 'em home in a bodybag
Now, look into my eyes, bet you see a realer killa thug puttin' it down with 
harmony, harmony
