Song:   The Mighty King of Swords
Typed by: Knowledge God, Cno Evil

[Sample: Del Shannon's "Runaway"]
As I walk along I wonder
Of what went wrong with our love
A love that was so strong
And as I still walk on I think of
The things we've done together
A-while our hearts were young

-beats switches to beat of Killah Priest's Tai Chi-

[Intro: Warcloud]
Warcloud, also known as Alcatraz
Formerly known as Holocaust
I found a dead body down in the Bahamas
Stewardess Fear Arcana
An afterlife train station
Gun low glance found your machine gun
Dragon slithered out of the cave and ate the fruit
Like the little boy encountered the convict in the swamp
Warcloud, aiyo, aiyo

[Warcloud]
Where the rats crawl across ceilings
Metal gats that walk lost feelings
Shredder raps, treasure maps, catch several bats
Knock pop bleeding, snatch your feather hat
Broke bones and smoke a bull zone, heavy the King of Swords
Ruckus bring the lords since Dubai of the Singapore
Corner store fruit market the target and harvest ammunition
Hand is twitching, bitching about shit, you champs can't commission
Out my mouth is wishing, gun planet inside a planet
I sip a Corona, keep tabs on Des the Moaner
Like the old men who make clocks and lived inside the mountain
That Church woman Charlotte who's hair was wet and scarlet
Or the Sheriff and his spouse who sold chronic out of the house
Spiny shiny warrior throne, I leave the sword blown
Corrode your corpse home, left behind me on path of war zone

[Chorus: Warcloud]
Deep in the horse's mouth there is a whisper
That shatters everything that exists, I clap a twister
That dismantles the planet, mechanic, the storm flows
Cold King of Swords in the forest of snow and gold
Cold King of Swords in the forest of snow and gold

[Warcloud]
Eighty eight torpedoes skim the water, I'm gunners mate
A mechanic device that sometimes resembles a human being
Capable of performing a number of complex tasks
The unlawful killing of one human being by another
To mutilate, brutally or inhumanely
All with premeditated malice, born to challenge
To escape 'Punishment' for destruction of a human body
We laid through a luxuriant form of period in history
Old ghostly mystery, twelve jewels of the mind
My heavy firearm carries slugs that eat your spine
He rose and thugs meet the line of cyber crime rhyme
Gun mall, fumble velocity, deep ferocity
Ferocious exposes, bombard bays that's hopeless
Plague ridden poetry, eat poet's cell nucleosis
Gung ho, gunfight, gunfire, your gun cock
My flip lock ignites hellfire 'til I retire

[Chorus]

[Warcloud]
My rhyme is like an extinct primitive bird from the Jurassic period
Having lizard like characteristics
Such as teeth and long ponytail
You 'Caddyshack' rap ass cats owe me mail
Admitted may represented traces were formed between reptiles and birds
Geologic copy, 'Comedy of Errors'
足足足足Arguers of poor resort, medallions, yo
Will owner of symmetry valiantly balance your harmony?
Gun solid as a guard of fucking Buckingham Palace
Grey and black markets, horse races, stallions
Gun you allegiant levels
Can't rival whisky, Jack, tropic fish, archers and mommies
Break water tsunamis, ice parlour, father of horror

[Break: Warcloud]
Leave you frozen
I'd like to give a fat shout out to New York
All the five boroughs of New York
Fat shout out to Los Angeles
Los Angeles County
City of the Lost Angels

[Chorus]

[Outro: Warcloud]
I found a dead body down in the Bahamas
Stewardess Fear Arcana
An afterlife
An afterlife train station
