Song:   Don't Judge Me
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Chris Brown]
I don't wanna go there
We should never go there
Why you wanna go there
I guess I gotta go there

[Chorus One]
You're hearing rumours about me
And you can't stomach the thought
Of someone touching my body
When you're so close to my heart
I won't deny what they saying
Because most of it is true
But it was all before I fell for you

[Chorus Two]
So please babe
So please don't judge me
And I won't judge you
Cause it could get ugly
Before it gets beautiful
Please don't judge me
And I won't judge you
And if you love me
Then let it be beautiful
Let it be beautifu-u-ul, let it be beautiful
Let it be beautifu-u-ul, let it be beautiful

[Chris Brown]
Everything I say right now
Is gonna be used in another fight
And I've been through this so many times
Can we change the subject?
You gonna start asking me questions like:
"Was she attractive? Was she an actress?"
Baby the fact is

[Chorus One] + [Chorus Two]

[Chris Brown]
Just let the past
Just be the past
And focused on things
That are gonna make us laugh
Take me as I am, not who I was
I'll promise I'll be, the one that you can trust

[Chorus Two] w/ variation at the end
Let it be beautiful {*4X*}
Let it be beautiful ay
Let it be beautiful yeah {*3X*}

[Outro]
I don't wanna go there baby yeah
We should never go there </pre>
