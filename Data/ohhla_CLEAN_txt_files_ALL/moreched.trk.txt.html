[Chours: Truck]
Yo, Bless, more tricks, more whips
Another mixtape, more bitches on our dick
Still live on the block, got plans to be rich
A Staten Island nigga on some real ape shit
Load up your guns, man, bust off your fifth
You never in ya life hear a verse like this
A Staten Island nigga on some real ape shit
You never in ya life hear a verse like this

[Bless]
Yo, how the fuck you gon' stop the Pop
I'm not playing, next thing a toe shank getting rocked
Forty auto cocked, black steel hammer
Rusty serial numbers, scratched out in the box
I'm more better, more fire
And I cap tools offa, happy men
I'll clap your men, then stomp your men
Run up in his pockets, they say, Bless, that's that bullshit
Fuck ya'll, don't floss around me
Who done gassed these faggot fucks, to get blum-blummed up
Ambulance come and pick 'em up
He done fucked up, stupid nigga, talk too much
It's the Pop, Truck sent me to pop ya head off
Planet of the Apes, going bezerk in New York
Everybody stand the fuck up
When the Bastardz is n this bitch, everybody get up

[Chorus]</pre>
