[Intro]
And the time says... (2x)

[Verse 1 - Zion I]
I'm like Golgo 13 assassinator
Known to those zones microphones and faders
I slip into
Where you've never been to
Come through and witness God within you
I think you
Really like what you see
In your inner most depths the rest is poetry
And it's spoken
From the city of Oakland
Where the flames is hot and rocks be smoking
No jokin
We begin to speak
With the word on the street vibrate to concrete
As a basis
Foundations we create this
Watch for what you wish God will assist
All endeavors
Thoughts like feathers
To carry the bird within your soul to the ethers
Always and forever
I still be
In the place with the grace
Do you feel me
We'll be on the run for the new sun
Til the last day when armaggedeon come
Armaggedeon come... (2x)

[Hook]
Life is one big road with lots of signs
(scratching: manifestation)
If you relax yourself and just chill you can take the time...
(Relax your mind)
To be yourself and free your mind...
(scratching: elevation)
And when you do it right...
You know your inner light shines
Your light shines... (3x)
(scratching)
(This ain't no game this is life)

[Verse 2 - Zion I]
In the middle of the night
I rhyme right
While my man Amp whippin up the beat sham
To inspire we set flames higher
Callin up the spirit talkin on a live wire
Just for the conflict
Just for the place
Just for the days when I was a mental slave
Allow my mind to climb when I ride mics
Take flight jump up withcha satellite
And get high from the soul less shower
Creator is the power
Destruct and devower
I'm on a Timex and my concepts
Better represent what I want to come at cha
Don't got time to play for this worktime
Everyday I gotta pray for the sunshine
Take time
Illuminate self divine
In a little time realize one mind
Yo...

[Hook]
Life is one big road with lots of signs
(scratching: manifestation)
If you relax yourself and just chill you can take the time...
(Relax your mind)
To be yourself and free your mind...
(scratching: elevation)
And when you do it right...
You know your inner light shines
Your light shines... (5x)

[Outro]
This ain't no game this is... life (2x)
(scratching)
This ain't no game this is... (2x)
(scratching)
This ain't no game this is... life

I'm like Golgo 13 assassinator...
Assassinator... (2x)

And the time says... (2x)

In your inner most depths the rest is poetry...
Poetry... (2x)</pre>
