[Intro]
ATL Georgia 
To New York City
The Kings have Arrived
Let's Rock
Let's Rock
uh huh
Don't Stop 
Let's Rock
Don't Stop
Let's Rock
Let's Rock
Don't Stop

[Scar]
Hey Forever I'm on the grind
my mind is already made up
Sippin the finest wine 
To Jamaica
Everyday that I make up
I look up at Chirst and think
therefore he lifts me up
So I don't see no haters

[Diddy]
Let me get an order
I got sumthin' for ya
You ever seen a black man
walk on water?
Talk Shit to me
And I'ma try to ignore ya
Get Disrespectful
And I'ma have to come for ya
And I won't go get your lawyers
Cause my combo quick
they comin' like de la hoya
Watch Niggas in the streets
Cause they will come for ya

[Ciara] 
[Chorus]
Don't ya wanna move
does this make you groove? 
Is the feelin good to you
It matters
Get ya Hot
our music our music
Come enjoy the fun
Don't ya wanna move
Just make ya wanna groove
Does this feelin' get to you
Let Us get you Hot
our music our music
come enjoy the ride

[Big Boi] 
Need I remind yall 
I started from the bottom 
But I'm destined for the top 
And I ain't stoppin' 
till I got em 
Call me clumsy for the weight 
I'm droppin' records 
BUt they breakin' 
Still standin' 
like the fuse on my cannon 
Blowin' weight kid 
Top shelf you gotta reach high to be the best 
I'm like Hennessey and coke and XO 
And nothin' less 
I'm the nigga BIG I know you know the rest 
Suppose I was a toad 
And no I ain't gonna rest 
I'ma bang on 
And make this music that we sang on 
Like skunk 
Always got my stink on 
Hang on 
You wasn't bangin' before we came on 
You know you lame holmes 
Zero ziltch 
Blow out ya candles 
Do it ya don't son 

[Ciara]
[Chorus]
Don't ya wanna move 
does this make ya wanna groove 
is the feelin' good to you 
It matters 
Get ya hot 
Our music our music 
Come enjoy the fun 
Don't ya wanna move 
Just make ya wanna groove 
Does this feelin' get to you 
Let us get ya hot 
our music our music 
Come enjoy the ride 

[Big Boi]
Need I remind yall 
I started from the bottom 
But I'm destined for the top 
And I ain't stoppin' 
till I got em 
Call me clumsy for the weight 
I'm droppin' records 
BUt they breakin' 
Still standin' 
like the fuse on my cannon 
Blowin' weight kid 

[Diddy]
Here we go back again 
Makin' that beat go bump bump bump bump 
So hard 
Why do niggas act so hard 
I don't give a damn about a broad 
I ain't gotta floss in the fastlane 
Ride right past lane 
I'ma in the ATL 
Flyin' down cascade 
Still spendin' money 
Ain't nothin' change man 
Spend a couple mill 
Just to make my change rang 

[Big Boi]
Hang on 
You wasn't bangin' before we came on 
You know you lame holmes 
Zero ziltch 
Blow out ya candles 
Do it ya don't son 

[Ciara]
Don't ya wanna move 
does this make ya wanna groove 
is the feelin' good to you 
It matters 
Get ya hot 
Our music our music 
Come enjoy the fun 
Don't ya wanna move 
Just make ya wanna groove 
Does this feelin' get to you 
Let us get ya hot 
our music our music 
Come enjoy the ride

[Diddy]
Hey yo Ciara 
Take us home baby 

[Ciara]
I feel high on the music 
I feel 
I might lose it 
It's talkin' through the melody 
I can hear it tellin' me 
To move 
I feel high on the music 
I feel 
I might losin' 
It's talkin' through the melody 
I can hear it tellin' me to move 
ARE YOU READY TO PRESS PLAY? 
ARE YOU READY TO PRESS PLAY? 

[Diddy]
Nah they ain't ready 
They don't believe me yet baby 
Y'all don't believe me yet?</pre>
