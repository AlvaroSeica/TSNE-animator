[Intro: DJ Khaled]
Money long, the night is young (another one)
The world is ours - DJ KHALED!

[Chorus: Chris Brown] + {sample from "Love Me" by Lil Wayne}
I know a lot of niggas in here prol'ly hate me right now
But I'll drink to that, I'll drink to that
That ain't gon' change a thing (noooooo)
Still gon' do my thing
I'm still - yeah yeah, still gon' go and get mine
Still gon' keep on winnin, still gon' keep it one hunnid every time
(I'm still) I'm still eatin' when them niggas throw shots
(I'm still) I'm still, still gon' end up on top
I'm still... {"Pussy ass nigga stop hatin'"}

[Wale]
Ralph, uh
Niggas be women like hoes be women; look at me close, there is no sympathy
Those with envy be throwing subliminal quotes, I'd rather them warring with me, uh
If only I hate them (word), like Tony Montana, except, no Manolo
She love me for another cuelo (word), these dudes is snakes these women is vultures
Who am I to trust? Who gon' ride for me?
Who gon' light somebody's body up when I be like "Yup", they squeeze comfortably? (ohh)
And that new custom piece, my Tisci t-shirt a couple of G's (ohh)
I talked to a bunch of G's just like a frozen tundra speech
And the Lambo feel what a real nigga doin 110 skrr in it, yeah
And the world so ill when the boy get funny over money or a girl on ya, uh
Let it marinate, uh, what, let me correlate, uh, let them niggas hate
But never ever let a women tell a nigga wait; uh, swag

[Chorus]

[Wiz Khalifa]
Most of these niggas ain't raw, most of these ain't poppin' (ain't poppin')
Most of these niggas ain't botherin', most of these niggas they starvin'
Talking cars and, what the fuck, they don't even got em
So high don't see no problems, bitch I'm on them trees like Tarzan (trees like Tarzan)
Aw man (aw man), I want all my cheese like Robin
Shrimp or calamari I'm a young nigga with options
Mm, and you close but you ain't close enough
In the VIP call me the poster child from postin' up
Top floor suite we going up; D.A.F: I'm dope as fuck
WOO! Hundred bottles comin' that mean a hundred bottles gettin' opened up
Rolex face all frozen expect ya'll to hate you ain't supposed to love it
She back it up, like a Tonka truck {*echoes*}

[Chorus]

[DJ Khaled]
Fuck boy, I kept it real, came up, wake up, feeling blessed
Pockets full, no stress, at the top, +We The Best+
Cuttin' checks, eatin' good, lovin' life, projects all night
(I'm still) I'm still, gon' shine bright in that limelight

[Ace Hood]
ACE HOOOOD~!
Ok now it's no more Mr. Nice Guy (nah); if you niggas couldn't see me in the day time (whoo)
Girl you got a better chance getting a day job, your career wouldn't blow away the napalm (boom)
Hah, silly mu'fucka (mu'fucka), who knows how to win the game on the buzzer (on the buzzer)
I'm the type to make a whole lot of money, buy a whole new crib cause I'm bored as a mother
And it's still fuck hater
Still gon' ball like Kobe from the Lakers (hah!)
Still +We The Best+, and it's still +Hood Nation+ and I'm still gonna smoke even if I'm on papers
