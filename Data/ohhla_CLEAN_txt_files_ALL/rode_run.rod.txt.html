[Li-Mouse]
This, is, how, we roll in White Plains
Ya'll wanna talk shit, it's all the same
We ain't in this shit for, none of the fame
But trust me, my high rollers will hold down the game
I rep both sides, imports and domestic
The way we move in formation, hard to digest it
Fuck them over sized big shiny rims
When I drop it in gear, I don't need nothing that shit ass spins
H deuce deuce never get loose with the juice
When I stay in front, I don't need no lame excuse
Cutting corners, I rip holes into fresh tar
I handle flawless, looks like I'm in a damn slot car
I told yas, real low with the rotors
Nigga don't let me send out the soldiers
You know I got cats with big blocks that call shots
And never blow spots, you know it ain't stock so just stop
The Camaro boy spin tires even on the road
You need more than a wiring harness to keep it under control
This ain't a stroll, we give ya ass shots whole
Whoops, I think I meant a hole shot
Next time you come through, be ready to rock
Yeah, yeah, yeah, be ready to rock, niggas, huh
(If you're on a...) Be ready to rock, kid</pre>
