[Verse]
I resemble my people told me get in there
So after turning pro, you bitch thinking it's skin care
It's been a long time coming so don't push me
My mama say you can be anything in this world except pussy
Bad luck, this is you meeting the writer
You're lame and that won't change Nick Cannon meeting Mariah
I've been killing shit since Dexter was pulling wings of the butterflies
And working at church is burning my brother fried, nobody
The coop God a cold vile of schizophrenic
Don't panic, it's cool and my brain is crowded
Fighting my demons with bras knuckles and face paint
A roof will get you to count a pussy to ace pink
They say I'm sick and deranged but know I'm from the hood
The evil easties are watch brand, it's understood
It's not a lane in our rapping, till I'm in dirt
If the police come in stripping
The weapons came with the shirt
Yeah, know we at, gotta get the mind off
Only soft when in came forth and still lying see it rot
This obstacle is deadly as Jigsaw
Knuckle money like getting jaws for a rich cause
Talking XO, means exposure with the 50th
When chosen clip blow them with the mortar I'm the stiff
I can divide and conquer, leave course in the split
And I don't mean benz when I'm foreign out the whip
Yo we call it in collision when the foreign's out the hit
Assumption got his never minds pointing out on bricks
Smugs, the worst riot face when I'm pump
She want no reminiscence I got new songs for Ginni Young
Voice cut won't protect space in your necklace
Acting 2 face, I'll get soon 'til they set with me
Yeah, a fatal chest blow out of nowhere
Heard bars lungs forgot air was s'posed to go there

[Verse]
I'm the definition of defamation
The depth of my deposition is deafening
Hit the deck when I deck the bitch
In the depths in your desperate mission
You ex musicians, stick my X to reland
In your ex's lips like an xtravision
The excellent exhibition of eloquence
Executive, a threat to y'all, my region lacks relevance
But that' irrelevant, residence has to presidence
Press against my lane and I will aim it at you head and chin
But you not a gun clapper, you a fun rapper
Some factor out what it's happening from with some capture
If crooked paved the way then I'm the one after
I'm every ghost rider for dr Dre and one rapper
Paying homage, I vomit on tracks repeatedly
Set the stage on rage and make it look Eazy-E
That way from my space to a new premises
If this the wrong call, then call me the new genesis

[Verse]
Ah, LA leakers
Another monumental montage
Like a Molotov luxury
Often monolog in this storm is
The art in me brought frauds apart
I brought gin on my saw shit
On to go yard against y'all bitch
Will party flow below part
Than my arsenium arsenic, y'know I'm more awesome
With the narcissistic
Bars a nigga me in walls been this marvelous
Nobody visited us in, it's amenes, outside of Dominicks
I'm wowed, this outlined incompetence
I've down sized been down when I out line the apocalypse
I got now, I'm back out rhyming the proxemics
Poppin' them with the bottles out, after I wanted to cancel it
Instead in the club, and my capella should drop an acapela
Enough to knock a fella, pockets and pasta paid from above
When I drop the penance draft, it's not no Letterman love
We hittin veteran 'tl they stop the negligence 'cause

[Verse]
Warrup dawg, this the king, kiss the ring
I'm dropping the guillotine so quick you forget to scream
While you twitching I'm sipping lean
Stronger than the mix between
Listerine and Mr. Green, 'til I tap out like pamperine
10 more rings, we strap like that to the finiteen
That's for intervene when it's any scream
Listen to me, I'm lighting up squares like smoking nicotine
Lighting up squares like a video scene from billie jean
Listen to me, fuck with the cops hollows will ring up
See all of us inked up, follow us
We got bottles and models and pink chucks
They callin' us king tut, when they swallow us
And all of these means what
Means my bank account swallow the bricks drop
And it means I walk with a mean struck
With the glock in the jeans tucked
G's up

[Verse]
Hotter then lava
Since I got with the swatters I'm hot as a top
And as bad as the choppas will pop you
Stop you drop you, spin and top you
Hammers on deck like we repairing the sail boat
Hammers on deck like it was family Borel's boat
There are crack bars, I call them sell dope
C E L L, 'cause that was a jail quote
Coniyac, Mykestro, Bad Lucc and Locksmith
You could tell it's west coast when you smell smoke</pre>
