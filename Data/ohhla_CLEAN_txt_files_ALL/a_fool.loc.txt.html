[Young Bleed]
(Verse 1)
Niggas say "Who that?"
Say they wanna do that
Run up if you will and get your ass whooped blue black
My nigga my nerve, fresh out the curb, jelly jam and preserve
Nothing but balls and my word, and a Mossberg
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
Whatever, my nigga, cause young niggas still down
Hollin' bout
"Huh, nigga what"
Huh, give a fuck, nigga what
Full of that weed
Planted like a poppy seed
A slanted and enchanted nappy nigga named Young Bleed, party on
In the jungle, where the murder million mumble
For months and days, trippin' off the blunts we blaze
Hell of a high, and tellin' 'em why
I'm a never say die, you can see it my eyes
And niggas say I Fly Like A Eagle, and see no, evil, ah
And ain't no sequel to this here
This year, I'm bailin' in the door, supernatural
Wicked, y'all niggas don't here me though (Hun)
But see how they runnin' everything on the cool
But they know I'm fin' to act a fool in this motherfucker

Chorus: Young Bleed
Niggas holla "How you do that there"
Roll it up and blow it up, cause nigga, we don't care
And niggas holla "How you do that there"
Roll it up and blow it up, cause nigga, we don't care
I hear they holla "How you do that there"
Roll it up and blow it up, cause nigga, we don't care
Niggas holla "How you do that there"
Roll it up and blow it up, cause nigga, we don't care

(Verse 2)
Bred to be a young boss hog
Backyard breed, pitbull puppy dog
Shaking up some shit, til they holla, wear the ring around my collar
Money and power got me dreamin' 'bout six million dollars (Shit)
Herbal existance make the world go 'round
And bitches love it like Brandy, they Wanna Be Down
But we gon' see now
Call it a art, but some say it's a shame
That you would give me your body
Before your name
It's all the same, baby girl, all around the world
Kick it up and make it twirl for diamonds and pearls
Fin' to take the lady for a tramp
In a Concentration Camp, of foods stamps
When it's down
With a trunk full of ounce, hollin' at them Young
Head for the hills (Uh)
And hide ya hoes
Them Corleones got 'em hoppin' out they clothes
And you never know, where the nose goes, when the doors close
Braid my afro, and let me out the back door
Supernatural, high
Livin' life, do or die
By the streets, smokin' on a swisha sweet (Hun)
Somethin' 'bout a G
In the mornin', bailin' out the door
On my way to school, high, been to act a fool in this motherfucker

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 3)
I give you about a pounds
And like some DPC's, off the walls of Parish Prison
No decision but a head-up, collision
Make money, my nigga
But keep it real dust, Soulja Boy stompin'
In steel toes, so tell me what you feel, hoe
Niggas know
I rock a party in a B-boy stance
Grab the mic and make them bitches wanna do that dance
But understand
That music calms the savage beast
But keep in mind, I put it down for you piece by piece
And walk the streets at night
Tryin' to get it right
At the speed of life, catch me tyin' up my Nikes, hollin' 'bout
With that south, life, nigga, don't give a fuck
Starts down all starrin' in some chucks, can't you tell that
I'm a funkadelic, psychedelic, reinterpretation
Of the third kind
Walk around the world blind
Tryin' to touch somethin' like I'm tryin' to phone home, gone federal
An extraterrestial
Tryin' to combat, call me Mortal Kombat
To the drum track, will make us hollin' 'bout "You done that"
It ain't no fake
Homey kind of like Raiden, so I still won't lose
And paid my dues to act a fool in this motherfucker

Repeat Chorus

[Young Bleed]
Give a fuck, nigga</pre>
