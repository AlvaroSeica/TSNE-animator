[50 Cent]
Just one night, two night
It could be three of us (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Girl we could get it on (where yo' girlfriend?)
Girl we can have a ball (bring yo' girlfriend, c'mon)
Life's too short to not fuck on the first date
No one knows if we're promised tomorrow
But if we make love into the next day
We'll have the rest of our time for celebratin

[Verse One: 50 Cent]
4 in the morning girl now I don't wanna talk
We've been talkin for hours, now you know I wanna fuck
Look I don't understand what it is you don't understand
My watch 100 grand, my chain 100 grand
Bitch I'm a wanted man, I say I run New York
Cause I do what the fuck I wanna do, they know what's up
They say my screws are loose, I say who cares, you know I'm rich
Look, I don't have time to blow with a bitch shootin the shit
Now maybe you can loosen up and let me go to work
So I can whisper in your ear while pullin down your skirt
When I get to strokin girl you don't know what to say
Quicky cum quick, girl I'm gone right away
Yeah, you nasty girl, you nasty
And I'm into that so get at me!
OWW~!

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I don't want no good good good good girl
Me, I want a nasty girl
Come creep with me, be a freak for me
Life's too short to not fuck on the first date
No one knows if we're promised tomorrow
But if we make love into the next day
We'll have the rest of our time for celebratin

[Verse Two: Too $hort]
I said beitch! I wanna fuck you in the worst way
Hell yeah I wanna fuck you on the first date
If I don't I say fuck you on Thursday cause then I won't want you
Watch how fast I dump you
But right now I'm infatuated
You get to hang with me, girl you graduated
I'll take you out for drinks and get you tipsy
Then I'll pull my dick out and I say kiss me
You're 'bout to laugh your lil' panties off
You only get one date, you better grab these balls
They wanna ride in fancy cars, that's what bitches do
They like to rub it, then suck it, and lick it too
She's a nasty little trap hoe slut
But I like that shit so let's fuck
Beitch~!

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
Ohh! Hey, sounds crazy
But tomorrow's not promised
Man I-I want you today, right now
I don't wanna wait
Wait for WHAT?
My time's runnin out!
Your time's runnin out!
C'mon girl

[Too $hort]
I wanna fuck you beitch
I wanna fuck you beitch
Right now beitch!
We only got, one date
Ain't no tomorrows
