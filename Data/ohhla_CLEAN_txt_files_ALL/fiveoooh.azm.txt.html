They ball, we fly
They rap, we rhyme

[ CHORUS ]
(A-haa...
You rap for the government
A-haa...
Police run your record label
A-haa...
You on a hit list now
A-haa...
Even if you don't know it)

[ VERSE 1 ]
The cops got your record on file, now that's a rap sheet
A big show, they wanna book you at a precint
Plus the promoter got groupies out hawkin
Your picture on poles in all the hoods that you walked in
Your whole record reviewed in abscence
Phone taps, big hits, mixed and mastered
They lookin for you from the night to the dawn
Them award shows are comin, you s'posed to informin 'em
For best video, show all your movements
On how to drugdeal, obtain distributions
You wanna chart with a bullet, cruisin
Spotted on the block, movin squat car units
Blue paranoia, they flashed when they saw you
They musta been producers, they had a beat for you
Three verses, 48 bars, and a chorus
You singin for the judge, you can get a deal for it
Check it

[ CHORUS ]

They crawl, we fly
They fall, we rise

5-0 made the new rap music
5-0 made the new rap music

They ball, we fly
They rap, we rhyme

That's okay cause we'll refuse it
5-0 made the new rap music

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 2 ]
In the days of backspins, when rappin happened
Before it meant soda, European fashion and actin
It was action, actin on passion
Actual facts on wax caused reactions
Switched the factions, trick distractions
Truth subtracted, fast forward backwards
Days wasted, bubblegum pop songs
Of sing-along thuggin, you another Pac knock-off
Y'all just softcore porn with headscarfs on
Plastic art frauds gettin the artform wrong
And twisted, the way we win Grammy's
Is to sell cheap sex, representin fake crime fairies
Don't tell me you a street life trooper
Even to you lookin back you seem stupid
We spring from the movement, you dream of illusion
Fuckin up the ways, puttin pork in your music

[ CHORUS ]</pre>
