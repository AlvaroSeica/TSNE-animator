[Verse One: Ice-T] (Trigger Tha Gambler)
Speed of life, fast (UHH!!)
It's like walking barefoot over broken glass (COME ON!!)
It's like, jumping rope on a razor blade
All lightening quick, decisions are made
Lifestyle (PLUSH!!) females (RUSH!!)
There's high profile personality, who earns his pay illegally
Professional (LIAR!!) School boys (ADMIRE!!)
Young girls desire, very few live to retire
My Cash flow is extreme, my Dress Code is supreme
My vocabulary is obscene
Definition, street player, you know what I mean? (COME ON!!)
The High Roller

[Chorus: DJ Evil E]
HIGH!! HIGH!! HIGH!! HIGH!! HIGH!!
SWITZERLAND JUMP!!
HIGH!! HIGH!! HIGH!! HIGH!! HIGH!!
EVERYBODY JUMP!! ROLLER
HIGH!! HIGH!! HIGH!! HIGH!! HIGH!!
COME ON!! JUMP!! COME ON!! JUMP!! COME ON!! JUMP!!
HIGH!! HIGH!! HIGH!! HIGH!! HIGH!!
EVERYBODY JUMP!! YEAH!! EVERYBODY JUMP!!
HIGH!! HIGH!! HIGH!! HIGH!! HIGH!!
YEAH!! YEAH!! YEAH!! YEAH!!
HIGH!! HIGH!! HIGH!! HIGH!! HIGH!!
UHH!! UHH!! UHH!! HIGH ROLLERS!!

[Verse Two: Ice-T]
People of Montreux stop fooling yourself (UHH!!)
Crime rules the streets, who the hell else?
All the police have gone out to play
No enough cold cash they'll look the other way
Look at the cars as they roll by
Benzs, Ferrari's, Trucks up high
Beepers connecting players to big-time deals
With all of this technology, who needs to steal?
Just live a life of leisure every night and day
And you're living proved that crime does pay
Your life is dangerous and reckless
You eat fly guys and girls for breakfast
You're a titan of the nuclear age
Muscles flex with the Uzi or 12 gauge
And you love the game, that's why you close
Because you're.. high price, high speed, high post
You're high rollers</pre>
