[The Game]
Get a blunt, roll the weed, light it up nigga
Sippin' on "Gin &amp; Juice", fill up your cups nigga
The West Coast back crackin' like it's '94
So bitch get on your knees and give me head like it's '94
And don't come up for air 'til the beat drop
I'm the Doctor's Advocate
Call it a sneak peak at the motherfuckin "Detox"
Take note, grab a pen
and let the world know the West is ridin' again
I graduated from Dre school, top of my class
Treat my switches like my bitches, got 'em droppin' that ass
Still bangin "The Chronic" like "Doggystyle" came with it
And I roll up sticky on my bitch back while I hit it
I done been there, done that, had beefs and won that
5 million records on one plaque, I hung that
Still got Dr. Dre lowridin' in the '6-4
When you see us throw it up for the fuckin' (West Coast)

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg] (Xzibit)
My heart beat for the West (West Coast)
We grow the best weed on the West (West Coast)
We lowride on the West (West Coast)
So I'ma die throwin' up the West (West Coast)
My heart beat for the West (West Coast)
We grow the best weed on the West (West Coast)
Still lowridin' on the West (West Coast)
You should take a trip and visit the West (West Coast)

[Snoop Dogg]
Check game, I'ma show you how to bang
Uncle Snoopy is it true you from that 20 gang?
All the time neph', I gotta let my nuts hang
A chest full of chains, left hand with a pinky ring
I'm in a Steeler cap, Swisher Sweet peel 'em back
My lil' hoodrat, baby got that mini mac
Baby got that twenty sack, baby got plenty that
Whatever you send us my nucca, we gon' send it back
I'm in the club with the snub gettin' love
with 20,000 Rips and 20,000 Bloods and
we don't give a fuck about none of y'all
And when you hit the city, you better holla at the Bigg Dogg
I done seen niggaz hit L.A. and get they chain snatched
Then they call me up beggin' me to get they chain back
What I look like, the motherfuckin' police?
There's certain rules you got to follow when you in these streets
Especially when it comes to this Cali shit
And I ain't talkin' bout hangin' in the valley bitch
Gangbang niggaz all up in the alley Crip
On some real talk nigga we the real ones (West Coast)

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg] (Xzibit)
My heart beat for the West (West Coast)
We grow the best weed on the West (West Coast)
We lowride on the West (West Coast)
So I'ma die throwin' up the West (West Coast)
My heart beat for the West (West Coast)
We grow the best weed on the West (West Coast)
Still lowridin' on the West (West Coast)
You should take a trip and visit the West (West Coast)

[Xzibit]
I heard the blue rag niggaz ain't fuckin'
with the red rag niggaz on the West Coast (Fuck you mean?)
Shit, from what I seen, red and blue can make green
Black Wall Street and X only
Since jealousy breeds hatred, hatred breeds violence
Violence breeds enemies, more permanent silence
California alliance... it's more important than ever
So throw it up, we lowridin' together (yeah!)
Make the West Coast rise forever
Ese's; B's and C's, represent your letter
Got Game the go-getter, Xzibit the rhyme spitter
Snoop Dogg the boss, we gangsta at all costs
Y'all niggaz is so soft and pussy so fuck off
Fore' one of my niggaz draw that hammer and dump off
It's kush, you gon' cough {*cough-cough*}
Yeah, inhale the smoke
Bandana hang, bang the Coast my nigga
(West Coast)

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg] (Xzibit)
My heart beat for the West (West Coast)
We grow the best weed on the West (West Coast)
We lowride on the West (West Coast)
So I'ma die throwin' up the West (West Coast)
My heart beat for the West (West Coast)
We grow the best weed on the West (West Coast)
Still lowridin' on the West (West Coast)
You should take a trip and visit the West (West Coast)</pre>
