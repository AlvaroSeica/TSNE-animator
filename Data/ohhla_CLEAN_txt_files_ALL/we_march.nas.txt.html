"It's much more than a march
It will be the beginning of a movement
Millions more movement; let us begin"

"Tell us what you hear"

[Nas]
Dear people of the globe
I hope that you're in good health
By the time my voice hit you
I hope in all wells with you
My mission is to bail with you
Touch upon some real issues
Senators, Government Officials
Sit at the conference and listen
Have a Coke or mineral water and say I'm reminiscing
George L. Jackson, Malcolm X last win when I'm rapping
Americans, Africans, Asians, Russians, and Arab men
Send your clergymen to journey with Nas from Queens, projects
I promise an unforgettable experience
compare me with, Amenhotep get in more debt
History was stolen, get in my zone
what makes the power that beef? less gangsta then Al Capone
The Rosetta stone was stolen like Chicago was
Think I'm a thug?, let's talk about some conquerors
Napoleon, Sun Tzu, Genghis Khan
Hitler, Edi Amin, Attila the Hun
Let's bring back to the cat that invented the gun
From the Indians all the way to the Pentagon
I'm sitting on Capitol Hill
I'm composing this rhyme, guaranteed to make all of y'all feel
The beauty that was trapped under siege
Believe in yourself you'll be free, take it from me

[Voice Samples]
"We will not surrender or we will not back down, we keep overacting"
"Throw up a fist for black power"
