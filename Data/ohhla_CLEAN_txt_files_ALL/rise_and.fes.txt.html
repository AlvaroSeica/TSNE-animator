[Intro: Fes Taylor]
Wipe the cold out my eye and shit
Yep, Brush my motherfucking teeth
Yep, Another day, Made it to see the sun rise
Sunrise, Sun rays shine from the sun shine, (Good morning)
Yep, What up my niggas, What up yall, (Good morning)
You know you gotta get on that early grind and shit you dig
Yeah, (Good morning) We out here paper chasing nigga
Get that gwap nigga, (Good morning) Yep, Yeah.

[Fes Taylor]
Standing in the lobby, Two-twenty, Selling crack
I wrote Spech's, Shut the mail box, Got a letter back
What up nigga, Know shit is rough on the wake up
You know me, G grinding trying to get this cake up
Having a good time when it's nice out side
But still my life like it's night-time why, Why, Why
They say the early bird first to get the worm
God still know I'm a good person in return, (Good morning)
Yeah, We just doing what we gotta do to eat niggas, (Good morning)
Girl yelling get a job, All this aggravation
You fuck around and get a nigga robbed, (Good morning)
Standing in the mirror getting dressed like
Like, Like, Like nigga I'm fresh, (Good morning)
The whole hood waiting for they check
I'm waiting for two I just came from my connect, Good morning</pre>
