[Intro]
Better not be taking my Lucky Charms
I've got an army of scary creatures
Stop taking yourself so seriously we put weird effects on the voice, WHAT~?!
Computer hip-hop

[MC Lars]
Yo, I'm more deadly than a venomous box jellyfish
My poetry is hella sick, and relevant let's celebrate
Forensic DNA is the way I murder tracks
I'm iller than a killer on death row so watch your back
Like Walt Whitman stacking stanzas damn it's awesome when it flows
The hip-hop Henry Rollins starting moshpits at my shows (born this way)
I'm a +monster+ going +Gaga+ do you want to take a ride?
The ghost of Byron talks to me and helps me write my rhymes
Like "Dnuorgrednu dedaeh M'i, srewes eht ni gnidih M'i"
Translation: "I'm hiding in the sewers, I'm headed underground"
And I'm alive, so glad we both can share this moment
Lack of passion, don't condone it, like Em said you've got to own it
I'm nice like Albert Einstein, a walking talking Stephen Hawking
Dark matter, spit it faster, got these kids at home all rocking
Horris Records, that's the label, so respect the competition
Still swimmin at the Y because I'm frugal when I'm winning

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
I'm a venomous box jellyfish
Box jellyfish! Box jellyfish, I'm hella sick
Venomous box jellyfish
Box jellyfish! Box jellyfish, I'm hella sick

[MC Lars]
Greenpoint, that's where my girl and I both stay
Grill &amp; Greens, copping lamb pitas like every single day (mmm)
Peter Pan doughnuts, yo I go nuts for the coffee
Spill it on my Moleskin journal cause sometimes I'm kind of sloppy (whoops)
My homey Zack is working on his Ph.D (get it Zack)
My homey Mike is working on his Ph.D (get it Mike)
I got my masters in emceeing on these stages
My generation is the greatest, someone had to say it!

[Interlude: MC Lars]
On Monday, I'm writing rhymes
On Tuesday, I'm writing rhymes
On Wednesday, I'm writing rhymes
On Thursday, I'm writing rhymes
On Friday, I'm writing rhymes
On Saturday, still writing rhymes
On Sunday - that's the day I experiment with logic presets

[Chorus]

[MC Lars]
Up in the New York Public Library
I was workin on this song
An old man to my right was on YouTube
Watchin music videos and singin along
Then this other guy got real mad
and he yelled at the guy like "Dude shut up!"
They started to fight but a cop broke it up
I kept writing the whole thing was nuts!

[Interlude]

[Interlude: MC Lars]
On Sunday, I'm writing rhymes
On Monday, I'm writing rhymes
On Tuesday, I'm writing rhymes
On Wednesday, I'm writing rhymes
On Thursday, I'm watching fights
On Friday, I'm writing rhymes
On Saturday, I'm writing rhymes
Hey guess what? Still writing rhymes!

[MC Lars]
Let the fish breathe on this one
(Jellyfish *4X*)
I'ma let the fish breathe on this one
(Jellyfish *4X*)

[Outro]
The internet has become this place for evil to dwell
You understand me? People who blog, whoever
No sense of reality, they just blog about you
Don't even know you
I got kids man that be readin stuff that ain't true 'bout they father
You understand? I know you know
Cause the people just blog, but you got to have
some God, you got to have, a piece of you
that holds you when all of it's bad
I give God all the credit for my existance man
For everything that I've ever become, because
He, he man, pe-pe-people don't know
(*laughing* Oh boy)</pre>
