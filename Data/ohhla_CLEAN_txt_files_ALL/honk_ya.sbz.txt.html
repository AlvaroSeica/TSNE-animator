[Intro: Shabazz the Disciple]
Here we go again...

[Chorus 2X: Shabazz the Disciple]
To all my big timing niggas wit they Tonka's on
Big blaze, big trucks, nigga, honk ya horns
Whether standard or stick shift, sitting on dubs
With both hands and your wrist lit, nigga, show love

[Shabazz the Disciple]
To all my niggas getting money wit them big car keys
To them luxury Sadans or them SUV's
We be, big pimping, spending cheese
Rolling out on 22 inch, B-A-L-D's
Whether you leaning on them '64 Chevy's or them Impala's
Alfa Romeos or alpha dinero, popping dollars
Or pimping in the Jaggy waggy, buggy lenses
The Lex Coupes, the Beemers or them wide body Benz's
Or burning up the I-95, with some Porsche's
Baby blue, racing car kit, twin exhausters
Ac' truck, mack tuck, or black Volvo
Promotion van flooded with logos, or rapping solo
No matter if you pimping a truck or low riders
As long as you got big blaze on your shottys
My dogs pulling them rabbies up, twisting them baggies up
We beating them fatties up, backseat of the cabby truck
Come through fronting in a Bentley aqua blue
Rocking Gucci alcatudes, top back burning tropical
Rock an Infinite and a Lamborghini all kitted
Them shits that turn colors when the sun hit it
Twisted bikinis in the backseat sitted
They looking peachy and creamy and they wit it
Test my sex drive, in the beemer X5
Or Yukon Danali, you gon' deny me?
Recording artist who borrowed this, cargos and yard 'dro
Who driveway look like a Funk Flex car show
Big toys, car bikes, galore
The ones with them spaceships, steering wheels and doors
Uh, straight off the showroom floor, fuck the auction
We flossing that shit that be costing a small fortune

[Chorus]

[Shabazz the Disciple]
I like my chickies like the sticky-icky, no seeds
And it don't matter if she licky-licky, she could blow me
I sent the tickies and after she hit me, hit my co-ds
The D.A. mad cuz he can't convict me, no leads
It's my hustle and my criminal intent to distribute
That got me counting yacht, cars, boats and crib loot
I love fast money, fast women and fast cars
We open up the B.Q.E. like Nascar
The hammers in the stash (fuck the law)
The scanners in the dash (peddle touch the floor)
Whip penals in the smash (duck -----)
------ Project make the girls go down
Money manages and massages make the world go 'round
Rocking George Jetson Audi's with the spaceship lights
Or them racecar letters same color the bike
Hah, straight off the showroom floor, fuck the auction
We flossing that shit that be costing a small fortune

[Chorus]

[Shabazz the Disciple]
Ain't nothing iller than a naked chick in a Chinchilla
Laying the seat back, fucking up the mirror
Or pimping with the girls in the curly shilling
With Shirley Temple curls and Louis Vitton shirling
Tahoe, eyes low, and you don't say goodbye
Now I'm dipping on your Ninja Honda with Teresa and Rhonda
Wig tucked, big truck, with they Tonka's on
I'm feeling your gangsta, mami, honk your horns
Ain't nothing like a good fuck on the bike
She riding you while you doing bout a buck on the pipe
We blow kisses at the mamis with them platinum yamis
Or dipped in the Armani, pimping the Ferrari
Look at esta loca in a Testarosa
I play my cards right, tonight, she strip and I'mma broker
Straight loca, Gucci sofa and a choker
You buffing with the three of clubs, I got the high joker
This summer who be ya number one stunner
Whether blowing in a black four runner or in a Hummer
Or swerving in a big suburban, or Excursion
We coming to a mall near you, pimp serving
Lot a bling, bada bing, bandanas and brims
All that money in your pocket why you got small rims
If it ain't a Ceville, Yami, or Chevy pull it over
Or, your little wheels get ran over by the Landrover

[Chorus 2X]

[Interlude: Shabazz the Disciple]
Yeah, S.T.D., my nigga Ganz, hah, yeah
Ringz &amp; Partnerz, my man Moongza, haha
Cilvaringz, what? A Tilburgh master
Red Hook, stand up, the block, baby

[Hook 2X: Shabazz the Disciple]
I'm feeling good, tonight, smelling and my ones is right
My team's strong and my guns is right
I know some of ya'll hotties in the party wanna fuck tonight
Who trying to leave in my truck tonight?</pre>
