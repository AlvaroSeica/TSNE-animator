* Deluxe Edition bonus track

it's just us we don't need nobody
Yea... yea... yea... sosa baby
Said todoe off the molly he spazzing out in the party man
Yea... yea...

[Chorus: Chief Keef]
All these bitches, know I get dough
Pop a nigga slow like crisco
I'm smokin on the gas like citgo
Fat ass, all white bitch though
Big rims, all white whips though
30 clips, all my clique though
You talk a lot but you ain't on shit though
We let off shots, you 'bout to get hit though

[Verse 1: Chief Keef]
I'm Southside I'll pop out
OBlock bring them Glocks out
300 bring them chops out
We shoot up your block now
Fredo bring them blocks out
Reese bring them crates out
I'm a bring them racks out
Make your bitch wanna stay out
But don't think she gone get paid now
I just like to play round
With niggas I don't play round
My boys shoot up the playground
So please don't get sprayed now
Sirens on the way now
We can do this all day now
Shoot you what you say now
I know she wanna come up
Cause I got lots of commas
Louie and Ferragamo
This why I'm so stuck up
High off the earth I'm fucked up
Bankroll got me puffed up
She got a fat ass then you know that I'm a fuck her

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Chief Keef]
Tadoe off the molly
He spazzing out in the party
GBE the squad
It's just us we don't need nobody
And these bitches call me papi
Cause I got lots of money
It's a OBlock parade
Drop in this bitch we coming
You better love your women
Cause Sosa fuck any women
These commas steady coming
I turned nothing into something
I be tired as hell
But my dick won't sleep for nothing
And we love getting money
I swear we won't sleep for nothing
See opps we pull our Glocks out
Hollow tips pop out
30 clips stick out
But please don't get shot down
On the plug I'll flood your block out
Disrespect my block now
Guarantee you get shot down
Choppas chop your block down

[Chorus]</pre>
