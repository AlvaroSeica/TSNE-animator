Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I'm smoking that grass on, stinky like waddam
My neck and my wrist all froze like waddam
Pockets all swollen, they looking like waddam
Pull up to the scene, all the bitches like waddam
Waddam, waddam, waddam, waddam
Pull up to the scene, all the bitches like waddam
Waddam, waddam

Pull up to the scene, all the bitches like waddam
You that nigga from the Lambo, you get down
I heard about your service, don't fuck with clowns
And if a nigga think us, we get blam
Them 300 boys don't fuck around
We be on that block, we chop you down
Serve them fiends anything now
Anything go for cheap now
It's a job but it ain't sweet now
Don't try to play us, you get manned down

I'm smoking that grass on, stinky like waddam
My neck and my wrist all froze like waddam
Pockets all swollen, they looking like waddam
Pull up to the scene, all the bitches like waddam
Waddam, waddam, waddam, waddam
Pull up to the scene, all the bitches like waddam
Waddam, waddam

Out of town trips, got me feeling like the mayor
Ten bands in my pants just because I can
No feeding these bitches money, man, I just give 'em grams
Just swapped my pull up for a brick and smacked it on a chain
Niggaz talking drugs but they ain't sold a thing
I still keep it on me, man, it ain't shit changed
Bitches ain't shit, they just wanna be saved
These bitches ain't shit, they just wanna be saved
In the trap, serving junkies, steady cal hunting
I break the word down then I give it to my cousin
First of the month, man, you know my trap jumping
If you ain't got no work, man, you better sell something

I'm smoking that grass on, stinky like waddam
My neck and my wrist all froze like waddam
Pockets all swollen, they looking like waddam
Pull up to the scene, all the bitches like waddam
Waddam, waddam, waddam, waddam
Pull up to the scene, all the bitches like waddam
Waddam, waddam</pre>
