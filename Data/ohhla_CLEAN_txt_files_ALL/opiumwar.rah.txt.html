Song:   Opium Warz
Typed by: Quest Rah

I hold my shield and armor break a way into a passage
Guardin' my abode while they carve up the atlas
Hallucinatin' tactics Puppets strung actors
And warring factions Import demonic passion
I pen a synopsis Watch the movie thru ya optics
Recite scrolls on note rolls of drum choppers
Masses roam like sheep spinnin' like helicopters
In Black Hawk Down we transport knowledge thru sound
And defend ourselves like Chinese authorities
From 19th century colonial opium anarchy
Fallibly these moves breed extremists
Anyone can see this but the blind
You don't get it tap the shuffle back and rewind!
I leave this mess behind to elevate spiritual state
Trekkin' over great walls illuminate my hearts flicker
Sufi dhikr
Overlookin' city lights the inner fight channel my inner
