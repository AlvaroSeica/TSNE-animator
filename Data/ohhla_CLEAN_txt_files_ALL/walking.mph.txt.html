Alright, alright, OK, huh

[Verse 1]
Aiyyo, we live life walking on a thin line
Love, hate, underground and big time
Try not to get caught up in the rip tide
Bedroom rapper writing in dim lights
Plutonic making beats way through midnight
Rumors lurk but we work with an inside insight
They want a big divide, fist fight
I'm gonna bring my live-die approach
While they sit by with their king size smokes
With a big smile, life drifts by and floats
And so, ya know it's all politics, real politics
Work politics, school politics, friendship politics
Bullies on the block trynna force you to follow quick
More love, more hate we choose to acknowledge this
Self-approved scholarship
In the face of a hollow tip
We sit back and wait for what tomorrow brings

[Scratches]
"MC's walk the walk but they can't talk the rhyme"

[Hook] {X2}
We all walk the tightropes
They may try to shoot down all of our high hopes
Every time I fall still holding a biro
We pick ourselves up and we make a side note
"I walk the tightrope" {First time}

[Verse 2]
Fan base growing, showing support
Handshake exchange though I know they deserve more
The pillars who put fun back into the sport
Didn't sell Hunger Pains, still played it in the store
It means more when they show off their teeth
Got a smile that leaves a permanent crease from cheek to cheek
Each reach just a volunteer's hand up
Achievement's peaked, believe I will stand up
Pull down my socks and then pull my pants up
All the while their trynna leave me handcuffed
Should be amped up, not getting pushed down
Reflect, double check now, take a look around
New job, new born, new car
New uniform, new heart, new body, new start
New dawn, your ambition is sitting in the food court
Move forward, take what's yours and just cruise forth

[Scratches]
"Step ahead of ya'
"I walk the tightrope"
"Walk in a line straight stuck doing the blind thing"

[Chorus] {X2}

[Verse 3]
Wait a second mate you should be happy here
Tonight we're trynna celebrate with a beer
But it appears you're just trynna interfere
In my inner ear, trynna say it's not our biggest year
C'mon!</pre>
