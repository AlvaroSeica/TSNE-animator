[Chorus: Tash &amp; 9th w/ ad-libs]
Gotta get my grown and sexy on
Gotta get my grown and sexy on, word?
I gotta get my grown and sexy on
I gotta get my grown and sexy on
Gotta get my grown and sexy on
Gotta get my grown and sexy on, word up

[9th Prince]
Yo, what up, love? I'm fresh out of jail now
I'm back on the streets holding weight like fishscale
What you drinking tonight? Popping bottles
The ace of spades, tricks of all trades
My game is sharp as a razor blade
Money, clothes and hoes, I guess that's how the game's played
Drinks on me, I'm buying the whole bar
I'm laid back, in the cut like a superstar
Shorty ass looking mean in the Rocket Republic jeans
It's just me, the Grandaddly Flow, no schemes
One look, and girls be having wet dreams
I'm 6'4", I walk the talk
And ladies be on the hawk from Atlanta to New York
Gators on my feet as I move to the beat
Gucci watch, from the corner, girls clock
All night spending gwop that I made from the block

[Chorus: 9th Prince]
Gotta get my grown and sexy on
Gotta get my grown and sexy on, word?

[Hook: Tash Mahogany]
Outstanding
Boy you knock me up
Inspiring, so inspiring
Stacking large amounts

[Tash Mahogany]
You light my fire, baby
I'm flying higher
Chill in this ride
I'm satisfied...

[9th Prince]
Aiyo, I handles my business
Whether friends with benefits or mistresses, what is this?
May you sleep with the fishes trying to diss this
She said put a ring on it
And if I was her boy, wouldn't treat women like a toy
I said I'm out to get Chips like O'Hoy
Slid off with my little two-step, I had to rep
To keep the rest of the ladies in check
Stapleton Projects, in the staircase I was taught by the best
Now I'm all up in V.I.P. celebrating with finesse
The Price is Right because my game is tight
Limousine Hummer, #1 Stunna
Stay in Ya Lane with your little 4 Runner
No, baby doll, I'm not a new comer
I bang like the secrets in the corner
Shorty got a body on her

[Chorus]

[Tash Mahogany]
You light my fire, baby
I'm flying higher
Chill in this ride
I'm satisfied...

[Chorus: Tash Mahogany]
Gotta get my grown and sexy on
I've gotta get my grown and sexy on (x3)
You gotta get ya grown and sexy on (x2)
I've gotta get my grown and sexy on (x2)</pre>
