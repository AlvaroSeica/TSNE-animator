[Intro/Chorus 1]
Ow ow ow owwww; set the cheetahs, on the loose
Ow ow ow owwww; there's a thief out, on the move
Ow ow ow owwww; underneath our, legion's view
Ow ow ow owwww; they have taken, Cleopatra
Run run run, come back for my glory
Bring her back to me
Run run run, the crown of our pharaoh
The throne of our queen is empty

[Frank Ocean]
We'll run to the future, shinin like diamonds
In a rocky world, rocky rocky world
Our skin like bronze and, our hair like cashmere
As we march to rhythm, on the palace floor
Chandeliers inside the pyramids
Tremble from the force
Cymbals crash inside the pyramids
Voices fill up the halls

[Chorus 1] - first half only

[Frank Ocean]
The jewel of Africa
What good is a jewel that ain't still precious?
How could you run off on me? How could you run off on us?
You feel like God inside that gold
I found you laying down with Samson
and his full head of hair
Found my black queen, Cleopatra
Bad dreams, Cleopatra
Remove her send the cheetahs, to the tomb
Our war is over, our queen has, met her doom
Ow no more she lives, no more serpent in her room
Ow no more it has killed, Cleopatra, Cleopatra

[Frank Ocean]
Big sun comin strong through the motel blinds
Wake up to you girl for now, let's call her Cleopatra, Cleopatra
I watch you fix your hair
Then put your panties on in the mirror, Cleopatra
Then your lipstick, Cleopatra
Then your six-inch, heels - catch her
She's headed to the pyramid

[Chorus 2]
She's working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight

[Frank Ocean]
Pimpin in my convos
Bubbles in my champagne, let it be some jazz playin
Top floor motel suite, twistin my cigars
Floor model TV, with the VCR
Got rubies in my damn chain
Whip ain't got no gas tank, but it still got woodgrain
Got your girl working for me
Hit the strip and my bills paid, that keep my bills paid
Hit the strip and my bills paid, keep a nigga bills paid
She's working at the pyramid tonight

[Chorus 2]

[Frank Ocean]
You showed up after work, I'm bathin your body
Touch you in places only I know
You're wet and you're warm just like our bathwater
Can we make love before you go?
The way you say my name makes me feel like I'm that nigga
But I'm still unemployed
You say it's big but you take it
Ride cowgirl
But your love ain't free, no more
Baby ay, but your love ain't free, no, more

[Chorus 2]</pre>
