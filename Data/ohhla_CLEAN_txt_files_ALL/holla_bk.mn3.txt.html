Verse One:

Yo Yo I launch lyrics like missles
Fully armed like pistols
Shells whistle (whoooosh)   
Im tryin to make you miss though
If you come across my path you better tip-toe
Cuz bomb threat, Im Mr. Wolf, who damn sure let the clips go
Its a cold game
Cold mane chizm
I fit the rhythm
Same time I gave you some wisdom
You cant fuck wit the Jesus 
You'll have better luck in the casino
At reno
Playin keno
I'm like battery acid in your ass 
Cuz you cant see me
Even if I stood on your bottom eyelid
I drob heavy like avalanches
To make the Earth quake
Try touching skills
You wont see ya next birthday
I'm shutting shit down
At five tornado 
When I blow shit down
Chrome pro 4-pound
Securing all grounds
With these bomb type sounds
You feel a couple of rounds 
Now you lost and found

Chorus (X2):

All my niggas if you down to wild it up
And you with me holla back
OOH OOH
And its like that

All my bitches if you down to make it hot
And you feel me holla back
HANGMEN
And its like that

(2 Spanish men talking):
Bly bezel
Nah hey gay
Coosombi diablo gigo
Keno blada
Si ooges gado tengo
Nah ha no
Ho day hombre no tengo
Hoy meng da me la

Verse Two:

Nigga getcha gun quick
Casino coming for your whole clique
Brought down
I told you we dont fuck around
What type of niggas do you think we are
Shit, we the type of niggas leave you dead in your car
(Know what I mean) Huh
I be catching niggas sleeping all the time
Till I run up on they ass with a Smith and Wess nickel nine

Ima catch you one day
Nigga you dont want no gun play 
Make you run away 
When you hear the gun spray

Chorus (X1):

All my niggas if you down to wild it up 
And you with me holla back
OOH OOH
And its like that

All my bitches if you down to wild it up
And you wihh me holla back
HANGMEN
And its like that

Verse Three:

Mr. Wolf solve problems
The problem is
You mother fuckers dont know who the hell you fucking with
Im one-third Made Men
One-third Hangmen
One-fourth Almighty RSO
100% Benzino

Chorus (X2):

All my niggas if you down to wild it up
And you with me holla back
OOH OOH
And its like that

All my bitches if you down to make it hot
And you feel me holla back
HANGMEN
And its like that

Verse Four:

We act on impulse
Three cats with twin pumps
Smash your eardrum 
Gats and fearsome
Manuevers we awsome
Holla boston when we toss'em
Call me gat man
Fuck batman
Fuck gotham
Cuz we shock'em for talking
Made Men the greatest off all time
How you gonna catch these jaguar niggas
We move like alzymes
Shit we flip we like a fucking greyhound
Hangmen 3 be like slugs hitting your mug
Off the 12 gauge
Hells gates get kicked in
Banana clips in
Spit ten 
Fifty rounds a second my section
Spark thee glock
Catch a ???
Get out and top these charts
And lock these blocks
Nigga wutchu thought it wasnt gone happen
Don't reach for this mic when Im rapping
Metaphors a blastin
You wanna roll with words
I'll roll with steel
Half the time I roll for the sake of keepin it real
Buts whats real
Is twice style baking your crew
Making me shoot
Now look wutchu making me do
Im high wrist 
And Ima die with the worlds tightest
Rhyme flow without being the idol
Stir of echoes
When you step in this place 
Put a tek in your face 
Take the ice off your neck
Hit you up and escape
We all straight

Dirty South if you down to wild it up
And you with me holla back 
OOH OOH
And its like that
Wild West if you down to tear it up
And you feel me holla back
OOH OOH
And its like that
East Coast if you down to wild it up 
And you with me holla back
OOH OOH
And its like that
MidWest if you down to tear it up
And you feel me holla back
OOH OOH 
And its like that
Roxbury if you down to wild it up
And you with me holla back
OOH OOH
And its like that
Dorchester if you down to tear it up
And you feel me holla back
OOH OOH 
And its like that
Mattapan if you down to wild it up 
And you with me holla back
OOH OOH
And its like that
Southend if you down to tear it up
And you feel me holla back
OOH OOH
And its like that

OOH OOH (X7)
