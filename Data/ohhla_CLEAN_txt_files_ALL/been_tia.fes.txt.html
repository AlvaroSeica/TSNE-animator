[Fes Taylor]
I said, I love hip hop, 2Pac, Big Pop'
Help me throw stones in the wristwatch, just watch
I linked with Koch, they used to think not
Said that my flow was cold, soon as you blink, hot
Heat up the globe and stroll, make a pit stop
Back to my old hood school, my homeys they get gwop
Saying how long will it take for you to break through
Learn that perfection takes time, so take full
Pain doing logic, now we into Pro Tools
Make true, so good, look at my neck froze to
DVD's mixtapes, moving like we flip weight
Started like Ace in Paid in Full with a big eight
Eat, spit, drink straight, celebrate get cake
Like money falling from trees, I need a bigger rake
I'm just grinding, told 'em I would make it work
Haters look at me now, since I'm a new work

[Chorus: Frankie Bells]
You will ride, by my side
All I need, your supply
It's hard to tell you from afar
There's more, living for you, throught it all
I thank you, thank you, thank you
What would I be without, what would I be without you

[Frankie Bells]
Give it time, I woke up wishing I was someone else
How did I, I'm holding wish somebody will feel what I felt
My mind, has been cracked, fell
Hold my hands, my body can't survive

[Chorus to fade]</pre>
