[Intro: Popcaan] (Busta Rhymes)
She have har man but, Popcaan a di only man she want
Di only man she want, yeah! (REMIX!)
She nuh care if she and him fight, or if him dry before eye would start cry
Mi a di only man she want (Mek mi talk to dem now!) Di only man she want

[Verse One: Busta Rhymes]
Yuh nuh hear how di gyal a yell out (BUSTA!!!)
Yuh nuh hear how she a deaf him
(Him a cry now) From di wey how she a leff him
Your shorty want me and you know it (HUH!)
And when I'm left alone with her, sir, and I know it hurt everytime she get up on it
(HA!) Some think it's inappropriate (HUH!) Baby I must propose it
Let us fuck the juices get the spillin like a water faucet
In the truck 'til it sweat will accumulate and drip up off it
Layin back and gently let you kiss up on it
I'm lovin everything you do, and I must commend 'em
Mi a di only man she want is wah she tell har friend dem
(Ha Ha Ha!) Now let me hot you up until your body melt
And how you save it for me cau yuh nuh want nobody else

[Verse Two: Popcaan]
Har man seh she very speciiiiaaaaallll! Yeah! Very special
A gyal a dry eye, mi nah lie, yuh have har pon di frontline, all night
If mi buy har di world and di stars, cho....di house and di car
Still she want gimme di ting inna di restroom inna di bar
HEY! She willin to wine pon di pole, willin fi give mi anywhere pon di toll
Or when him a search up har phone a Popcaan a every ring tone
She cuss har and call har whore, same friend seh di relationship bore
As him talk and tun him back she a link up ova Portmore

[Chorus: Popcaan]
Him tell har fi stop, seh him ago chop, seh him ago shoot, seh him ago shot
Popcaan a di only man she want, di only man she want, yeah!
Him tell har go cheat, seh him ago cheat, seh she ago weep, seh him ago beat
But mi a di only man she want, di only man she want, yeah!

[Verse Three: Popcaan]:
Seh she love off di plat a pure yute, cut off foot jeans mi nuh haffi wear suits
Har man is wealthy mi nuh haffi use loot, and a nuff time she tell mi we nah fi use shhhhhhhhh........
Di gyal a, fight fah mi like American troops, she a mi real bad charge a she a mi dupes
Nuh care if he leff a him cut or him bruise, A Popi a di man weh she choose

[Chorus: Popcaan]
Him tell har fi stop, seh him ago chop, seh him ago shoot, seh him ago shot
Popcaan a di only man she want, di only man she want, yeah!
Him tell har go cheat, seh him ago cheat, seh she ago weep, seh him ago beat
But mi a di only man she want, di only man she want, yeah!
Him tell har fi stop, seh him ago chop, seh him ago shoot, seh him ago shot
Popcaan a di only man she want, di only man she want, yeah!
Him tell har go cheat, seh him ago cheat, seh she ago weep, seh him ago beat
But mi a di only man she want, di only man she want, yeah!

[Verse Four: Popcaan]
