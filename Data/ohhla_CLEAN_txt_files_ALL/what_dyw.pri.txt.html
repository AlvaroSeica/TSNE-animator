I'm back, damn
I forgot about how disgusting
Yet, somehow delicious your food is
Anyway, as you might imagine
Where there's a lot of merchandise
There comes trouble in paradise
The duplicants began to get unhappy, and wise

I'm the best
My breath to my breasts, especially undressed
Never get depressed, so impressed
Take everything till nothing's left
So, advance to France, make 'em dance
Due to Zimbabwe, another pay day
?, they think I'm awesome
Compton to Thompkins, leave I'm wanted

What do you want, what do you want (cars, cars)
What do you want, what do you want (jewels, jewels)
What do you want, what do you want (cars, cars)
What do you want, what do you want (more, more)

If you wit me, let me hear you say uh, uh
If you wit me, let me hear you say uh, uh
If you wit me, let me hear you say uh, uh
Say uh, uh

I've spread like a virus
Get what I want, a remote control in my iris
I ruled the kindness
Gotta be ruthless baby, why don't you try it
Wonder what it's like to be me
Everyone buying, dying to get next to me
Yeah it's ecstasy, even better than some sex could be
Uh, everything you dreamed and more, the ?
?, desperate to score
Drippin' in diamonds from my head to my core
To my hymen all for my beautiful rhymin'
Nobody knows who won the Nobel prize
But everybody knows the colour of my eyes
And when I go up a dress size
And my market sliced and my pocket book priced
Hey, Duplicant 661, what the hell is going on
You a broke clone or su'thin', can't you see
I'm in the middle of a song, what's wrong
(Sorry Superstar, I'm feelin' worse)
(I think it's gonna be a brain spurt)
(My body, my soul, everything hurts)
(My brain and spirit broke, they don't work)
You jerk! I don't care
Better push and make it work, get out there
Feel bad about your life, I don't care
Wanna make things right, I don't care
What you need right now is just more things
Buy more things, you feel nothing
Money ain't a thing for what it brings
Diamond rings, you need more things

What do you want, what do you want (cars, cars)
What do you want, what do you want (jewels, jewels)
What do you want, what do you want (cars, cars)
What do you want, what do you want (more, more)

If you wit me, let me hear you say uh, uh
If you wit me, let me hear you say uh, uh
If you wit me, let me hear you say uh, uh
Say uh, uh</pre>
