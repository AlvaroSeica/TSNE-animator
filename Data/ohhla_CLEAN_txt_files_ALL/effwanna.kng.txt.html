[Intro]
Hello? you said what?
[laughs] I took a picture with your baby's mom?

[Chorus 1]
This is for the real g's
Fuck you wannabes
Where the bad bitches at?
Put 'em right in front of me
This L.A. til the day I die
This California til the day I die bitch
Til the day I die

[Verse 1: King Lil G]
Til the day I die
Posted with my dodger blue
Enemies could die slow
It's always been my attitude
Ready to take your bitch out
On a hot date
Some of them be livin' local
And some of them livin' out of state
You can hate on the king
While I celebrate
South side flowing through my blood
Rolling through my veins
My team's strong
The weed strong
Chile walked in with some hoes
I'm trying to creep on
I do it for my people with that brown pride
Taking it back to days
When you was bumping out your alpine
Bodies on the floor
Murder outline
Boys incarcerated
Eating food when it's chow time
But it's L.A. on mine
I told you soldiers don't die
California holdin' my pride
My homie drinkin' them fortys
While police posted outside
This for Drumma boy
For the instrumental supply

[Chorus 2]
This is for the real g's
Fuck you wannabes
Where the bad bitches at?
Put 'em right in front of me
This L.A. til the day I die
This California til the day I die bitch
Til the day I die
L.a. tell me where you at
Til the day I die
O.c. now tell me where at
Til the day I die
818 yeah tell me where you at
Til the day I die
805 what? tell me where you at
Til the day I die

[Verse 2: 2-Tone]
Hurr up I'm bout to make this place turn up
Hit the light switch in this bitch
With the burner
Another day another dollar
Another beat is bloody murder
Tony deuces coming through
Watch all these bitches pull they skirt up
Word up
I'm only cutting if it's major
Megan fox status or unless the bitch has paper
Only way I'm going out is with a cross fade
So tell me if I'm living wrong
When I die then play this song
And say tone held it down for his street block
Victoria ass out
Gabe down on d-block
Me &amp; lil g be the kings of this g-hop
Been known to get hoes on all fours
And hear they knees pop
Yeah I smoke good &amp; eat, party
When I'm with the sucios
It ain't nothing but a gangster party
You can see it in my eyes
I'm a put it down for L.A. bitch
Yeah til the day I die

[Chorus 2]

[Verse 3: Young Drumma Boy]
Til the day I die
I'm chilling where the birds at
Make a few ends then I smoke
Where the herbs at?
Man I gets high
Hear this every day
Spend little money on my watch
No chain
Homies that I'm with
All rep the same gang
And they all yelling out money ain't a thang
Smoking on loud
Yeah I mean the loud pack
I ain't gotta tell you where it is
But I got that out in L.A. back to the p
Where ever I be
Yeah thats where they be
All up on the block
Ask 'em where the bud at?
Older homies still on parole
And they love that
Bitches stay fly
I ain't gotta say that
Fucking with my money or my team
I don't play that
It's on every day
And it's on mine
Ask me what I do it for?
This how I reply
Yeah</pre>
