Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
Uh four B's and we in this
Bat gang bitch big business yea you know what it is
Right from the beginning
I've been tryna keep it real with these niggers
But they just don't understand
Everything changed since I left home
Tryna do it big say I'm dead wrong
Can't worry bout putting no one else on
Mofucker I'm still tryna put myself on
Everyday blowing up my cellphone
I just disappear yea throw the stealth on
Uh I'm looking at em like fools
But they still looking at me like fool
What it do

[Chorus]
We made it through the storm
Lost a couple friends
I don't toot my horn
I just tell it how it is

Let me tell you how it is
Once you get the fame
And the money swear ain't nothing the same
But I can never change

Two cups two blunts
Yea they tell me that I'm doing to much
But I can never change

For real for life
If it's wrong I don't wanna be right
No I can never change

[Verse 2]
I can never change
Man of my city no LeBron James
Hands if you with me
Yea we on the way
Team strong even though I had to make a couple trades check
Hardhead still here
Nigger L still here
Better watch the throne
Make you get up out your chair
I believe in god
So it's nothing else to fear
Rolling with the A-Team
I can never fail ah
Turn em in to ashes
Burn one tell these niggers
I've been on my rap shit
West side throw it up
See if you can catch this
I pay dues in taxes bitch

[Chorus]
We made it through the storm
Lost a couple friends
I don't toot my horn
I just tell it how it is

Let me tell you how it is
Once you get the fame
And the money swear ain't nothing the same
But I can never change

Two cups two blunts
Yea they tell me that I'm doing to much
But I can never change

For real for life
If it's wrong I don't wanna be right
No I can never change

[Verse 3]
No for nothing
Came in the game
Straight up out the oven
Too hot to be ready
Nobody was ready
Bitch I'm on fire
Somebody come wet me uh
Come get me
Fore I talk that shit
Life ain't fare
But I can show you
What that waffer is
I'm off that shit
Coughing it
Sick as fuck
Call a medic
I ain't talking to these niggers like they outfits
Remember back in the days we was riding pegs
It was simple then now it's all wired
Just call me 5 down cause I'm outta here

[Chorus]
We made it through the storm
Lost a couple friends
I don't toot my horn
I just tell it how it is

Let me tell you how it is
Once you get the fame
And the money swear ain't nothing the same
But I can never change

Two cups two blunts
Yea they tell me that I'm doing to much
But I can never change

For real for life
If it's wrong I don't wanna be right
No I can never change</pre>
