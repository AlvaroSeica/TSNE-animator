enter inside the place, enter where the bad boys base
get up on the move and jump around
rock to the rythum of the bad boy sound
enter inside the right, _
massive inside the place, massive where the bad boys base

step up, step up, step up, step up, step up, step up
me gone go buck
we gone fill you up on liquor till you hung over
jumpin around, we party till the sun come up, ay yo

enter inside the place, enter where the bad boys base
get up on the move and jump around
rock to the rythum of the bad boy sound
enter inside the right, _
massive inside the place, massive where the bad boys base

ay yo, ay yo, tune up my radio man
deejay is playing my jam. I get it cracking where ever I am
got to, got to __
moving around, jumpin around
bob to the rhythm of the bad boy sound
enter, enter, in the center, move to the rhythm of the right selector

got ya, got ya, moving that thing
bring it hear, I know what to do with that thong
go girl, do the damn thing
work that body till you pull a hamstring
you're an energy booster, caffeine in ya
looking good on the cover of the magazine
you're a slave to my rhythm
I charm the snake out of the basket
its hard to behave to my rhythm
hypnotic wisdom, mind bending, invent the venture
everybody freeze when you enter
front and center, shift your weight to open space
shape below the waist, make your body like a rolling quake
it's the moon tribe vibe, hit the drum circle
beach bums beating on their drums till they're thumbs purple
tide rolls in, night soaks in, let her move her belly
hit me with the right motion
hitting high notes, grinding with her thighs open
oh my god

jump, jump get on the move
rock to the rhythm of the bad boy groove
jump, jump, moving around, rock to the rhythm of the bad boy sound. (x2)

jumping, around, jumping around

pick up every ganja man, pick up every hustle
pick up every rough neck and pcik up every youngster
pick up all the junglist and drum and base defender
pick up all the roots man and pick up all the rasta
cause yes I'm a lyrical __
and yes I'm a soldier
me rhyme to the rhythm___

ay yo, ay yo, tune up my radio man
deejay is playing my jam. I get it cracking where ever I am
got to, got to __
moving around, jumpin around
bob to the rhythm of the bad boy sound
ENTER, ENTER, IN THE CENTER, MOVE TO THE RHYTHM OF THE RIGHT SELECTOR</pre>
