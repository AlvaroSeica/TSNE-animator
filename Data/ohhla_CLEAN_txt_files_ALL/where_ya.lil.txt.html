Hey, check this girl, you look bout like damn

Aye yo check this girl, check is my cellphone on
I gotta pay my bill, and I gotta text my phone

Bitch, I might go to jail
So suck a nigga dick cause I can't post bail
Yeah, that pretty bitch in here
Bitch, pass a bad bitch and I'm a go stupid as hell

Make a bitch looking fool like Mack Maine
I'll shoot a bitch if you trying to fuck me
Pussy, hey

[Chorus]
Uh girl, you look so good
I'm a take your ass up out of the hood
Uh girl, you look so good
I'm a take your ass up out of the hood
Where you're from, girl?

[Verse 2]
I'm In the club, dancing like Ray Charles
Boy dancing with the heat you won't see tomorrow
Bruh ridin' with the fye like the police
I ain't got a badge, but I tot heat
Bitch, kiss my ass cause I'm Lil B
When I hold the choppa, look like Scream 3
Bruh go tell the people that I told you that
Bruh go tell the people, I gotta ski mask
Tell them people I'm a made niggas
Stuntin' every day in the bay, nigga
It's how we get it in
Summer time you know, I'm finna fuck a bitch!
Bruh to ask me about ten questions
Talk to Based God, boy you need a blessing
I ain't about to teach you a lesson
Come on over here, and you can thank me later, bitch!

[Chorus x2]</pre>
