[Intro]
What's happenin? It's Gucci~!
Ay Keyshia, I'm feelin this girl man but
She ain't right y'knahmtalkinbout?
(Take one) take one {ohh-ohhhhhh-ohhh}
I can do bad by myself knahmean? F'real
Okay, action (action)

[Gucci Mane]
Rap game paid me, trap game made me
We used to be good friends now she cain't stand me
Her man ain't G, her man ain't me
Her man cain't be what her man cain't be
My jewelry game fridge-y, white watch blizzard
Crocodile lizard, pinky rang ignorant
I'm careful who I step to when I step to
And if I choose first she choose me then she special
Long walks, all night, dawg I can help her
Bless her, show her how to be successful
Yessir, Gucci hustler, I finesse her
Sun Valley cook up, second under escrow
Stack up, loud pack, make her catch a contact
Dumb set, long stack, I can make her come back

[Chorus 4X: Keyshia Cole]
I can do bad, bad, bad, bad - all by myself

[Gucci Mane]
I'ma bad boy but still there's so much good in me
You can take me out the hood, the hood is still in me
I need a girl to feel herself, but can still feel me
Just let me be your only choice, no need for plan B
My love life was malnutritioned, you my vitamin C
Stay down like Hillary and I can be ya Billie
I'll buy you Jada Pinkett pinkies, I'm the biggiest Willie
Just when I give it throw it back just like we playin frisbee
I can do it by myself, but I'd be very lonely
Be the diva who's my lover and my closest homey
So if you sick and tired of bein sick and tired call me
Pick up the yellow pages and look up Gucci (Gucci~!)

[Chorus]

[Keyshia Cole]
Ain't no need in arguin about it
If you wanna leave then just be 'bout it
There's no sense in blamin me and me blamin you
There's no reason to be untrue
Everything I got I work hard for
Every day I work hard to make more
I can do bad all by myself
I ain't tryin to play love games
Cause I can do bad... all alone

[Chorus]

[Outro: Keyshia Cole]
But I can do, baaaaaaaaaaaaad
Ohhh-ahh
Ay-yeah-yeah-yayyy, can you hear me?</pre>
