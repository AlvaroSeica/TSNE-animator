[Kemo]
I once heard a man say "Now hey what be your fate?"
Wanna laugh with the sinners or cry with the saints
Simple and plain refrain or sustain in vain battle wound
Midnite gloom right under midnite moon consume
Exceed the limit forget it the man don't wanna hear it
He says "Let's go" but I'm late
I gotta rock a show I'm gone
Play me a so long song mister piano man
Eyes gleem bright like gems from ancient lands
We hot like desert sands we rock like rock bands
They live in scared city sunset make em look pretty
I'm tryin to shine lead the blind through Sahara twilight
Cross a line in the dirt, choke hold on the mic

Chorus 2X
So take a midnite spin callin you from within
Put some ink in your skin city lights bring sin
A midnite spin callin you from within
Put some ink in your skin city lights bring sin

[Ives]
Could I be a neighborhood legend cough to clear resin
Feelin after affect of a million smoke sessions
Oh and 'bout mi placas and don't ask if I'm stoned
Just know that it's mi pinche lifestyle and I move it along
I put the piercin shine chrome freak the mic phone
Keop and chop down the sound that break bones
See I ask music a question and the music reply
See I respect how I groove and it's emotional prye
Anyway get back to music and the music reply
Said let em see there's somethin better no one's ready to die
So I'm a midnite spin spiritual practicin
Just to let you know that I've come back again

Chorus

[Sick Jacken]
In the Sick Syde we lead a crazy lifestyle it consists of
Drugs and sex, rockin shows and possible arrests
To last breaths livin the high life avoiding wrecks
And passin the low life tests with stripes mic checks get blessed
On any set Pyschos bring threat to upper deck
Authority reps fear bald heads and tatted necks
We earn the respect and get heat from the rest
So we deal with stress however we can 'till our deaths
Inner city district experiences we recite
If you can't relate to this well all right
Get you shit tight run little drugs in daylight
Despite the lifestyle you know you need to get right
