[Intro: French Montana]
Montana!!! 

[Chorus: Charlie Rock (French Montana)
Shorty got potential I could be her sponsor (HA!!!)
Met her back stage at a Summer Jam concert (HA!!!)
Hair like Rihanna, shoe game was awesome (HA!!!)
Could tell by her aura she want a shot caller (HA!!!)
Wanna be with a baller, shot caller
Could tell by her aura she want a shot caller
Wanna be with a baller, shot caller
Could tell by her aura she want a shot caller

[Verse One: French Montana]
Di-Di-Dippin in the lac (Slow) Three in the back (Oh!)
Two if you fat (AH HA!) Pimpin is a fact (AHHHHH!!!!)
Fresh up out the street hot jump to the top
I be French Montana from da-da-da block
Went solo on that ass (Ass) Solo on the ave (Ave)
All white navy blue polo with the hat (What's up?)
I go RRRRRROAW RRRRRRROAW like a dungeon dragon
From the South Bronx home of the original clappers
It's just another case (Case) Diggin in the crates (Crates)
Empty out the tool they was fillin 'em with hate (Hate)
Livin life fast against mine's on a speed boat
Spark the weed like it's legal!!!

[Chorus: Charlie Rock (French Montana)
Shorty got potential I could be her sponsor (HA!!!)
Met her back stage at a Summer Jam concert (HA!!!)
Hair like Rihanna, shoe game was awesome (HA!!!)
Could tell by her aura she want a shot caller (HA!!!)
Wanna be with a baller, shot caller
Could tell by her aura she want a shot caller
Wanna be with a baller, shot caller
Could tell by her aura she want a shot caller

[Verse Three: French Montana]
Ba-Ba-Back on the scene (Scene) Crispy and clean (Clean)
LV the logo, even on the chain (That's right)
Don't be funny style with the funky funky child
I do it Frenchy style, and let the money pile
She ain't wanna talk (Talk) 'Til she seen the top off
Call me pimp homicide let her jump off
Feel the texture, rumble on Webster
Stand on my own not who I stand next to
Can I hit it in the mornin?! (Mornin) Fo' sho' Ill be pimpin like a pro
And all the bad bitches know when the money hit the flo' 
Better pick it up, pick it up, pick it up

[Chorus: Charlie Rock (French Montana)
Shorty got potential I could be her sponsor (HA!!!)
Met her back stage at a Summer Jam concert (HA!!!)
Hair like Rihanna, shoe game was awesome (HA!!!)
Could tell by her aura she want a shot caller (HA!!!)
Wanna be with a baller, shot caller
Could tell by her aura she want a shot caller
Wanna be with a baller, shot caller
Could tell by her aura she want a shot caller
Shorty got potential I could be her sponsor (HA!!!)
Met her back stage at a Summer Jam concert (HA!!!)
Hair like Rihanna, shoe game was awesome (HA!!!)
Could tell by her aura she want a shot caller (HA!!!)
Wanna be with a baller, shot caller
Could tell by her aura she want a shot caller
Wanna be with a baller, shot caller
Could tell by her aura she want a shot caller</pre>
