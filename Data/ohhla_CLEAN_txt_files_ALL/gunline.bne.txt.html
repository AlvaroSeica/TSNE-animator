[Layzie Bone]
Nigga don't cross that motherfuckin' fine line (dog house)
Niggaz do too much (represent)
Tell 'em bout the gunline boss (y'all niggas thought it was over?)
Pop pop this (it ain't over motherfucker)

[Chorus: Layzie]
Said if these niggas try to trip, they bout to get tossed
Gon' and tell 'em bout the gunline boss
Said if these niggas (nigga) talkin' (nigga) shit, and pissin me off
I'ma tell 'em bout the gunline boss
Said if these niggas want (nigga) some work, don't put us in dirt
I'ma tell 'em bout the gunline boss
And if these niggas talkin (nigga) shit, and pissin me off
I'ma tell 'em bout the gunline boss

[Verse 1]
Click, clack, clack, clack to the motherfuckin (gunshot) ???
Blow a nigga out by the briz-ain (briz-ain)
Shit still the siz-ame (siz-ame)
My name is Layzie bone (bone) and I'm still in here (here)
Gimme a motherfuckin bit (bit) and i ain't got no fears (fears)
I roll, with my dogs (dogs), my dogs (dogs) with (with) me (me)
Now what the fuck they wanna see, the B-O-N-E or the MO T-H-U-G (T-H-U-G)
Up in this motherfuckin piece
Nigga don't let the beats (beats) release (release) up outta me (me)
When i put it down (down down) down, diggity down (down)
Motherfucker, you know the sound
I'm just a thuggish ruggish nigga out the land (outta the land, hunh)
Ready to buck a motherfucker bitch say it who (hunh, hunh, hunh, hunh, hunh)
Now who the man ? nigga it's me (me)
That motherfuckin nigga you fear to see (fear to see)
Live on T.V. (what)
But up in person, who the worst motherfucker (fucka)
And all y'all niggas bluffin to me (me)
And it ain't nothin to see
A nigga come up and come down
Put it up from sundown
With sun up, and I'm around (around)
On the block, the first on the block
All the cheese, and the last lil' nigga to leave

[Verse 2]
I see the killa in my vision, niggas ride tonight (tonight)
Shits wicked, like religion cause you dyin tonight
Baptized in blood, open bullets and slugs (pop, pop, pop, pop, pop)
All he felt was a cold wind last breath ??? to free your soul from the body
Bitch rot to death
When we cock, aim, and spit
Count your teeth get hit (ha, ha, ha, ha, ha)
Rip flesh, break ribs, turn wifes to widows
Summer time it's unforgettable, dawg its pitiful
But this the streets we live, ain't no love for the next soldier
Stick for the next soul
Nigga make mud collide with his arm
Wrestle with tats, hit us we hit back
Just a city of black, with the gunline mac
Who want war ? who wanna lose a few loved ones ?
It's russian roulette, we rush niggas and leave 'em wet
When we get 'em with the gunline boss

[Chorus]
Said if these niggas try (nigga) to trip, they bout to get tossed
Gon' and tell 'em bout the gunline boss
Said if these niggas talkin (nigga) shit, and pissin me off
I'ma tell 'em bout the gunline boss
Said if these niggas want some (nigga) work, don't put us in dirt
I'ma tell 'em bout the gunline boss
And if these niggas talkin (nigga) shit, and pissin me off
I'ma tell 'em bout the gunline boss

[Verse 3]
Lemme explain about the gunline and crunch time
A regiment of riders packin automatic muskets
Line a bayonet inside you
Smoked out, fried up, blind fold you up
Line up the firing squad, and light that ass up
We striked 'em, my lyrics spent years in the cut
Swang nuts, must i ??? is fucked up
Lately they run from cops still pissin us off
Desperidos in the heart, ain't recruitin no mores
5 rounds down the glock will leave your body in sauce
Diamond tell 'em bout the gunline boss

Tell 'em bout the gunline gunline
(tell 'em bout the gunline, tell 'em bout the gunline boss)
Tell 'em bout the gunline
(just tell 'em, tell these motherfuckers)

[Verse 4]
What you don't know ? I'ma street nigga, ride on the block
That get 7 figures, pull triggers
Call me up when they cross the gunline (what nigga?)
Best believe, i come with shit that'll shock they mind
What you don't know ? i cant be stopped
Hit the block, all you hear is pop pop (2 gunshots) gunshots
What you don't know ? meneski mine
Like it's motherfuckin job
What you don't know ? you ain't heard ?
That the rhymes that we spur
Mo Thug we back, and can't be cracked
What you don't know ? cross the gunline
And I'ma spark with my fuckin' 9
It's my time, to motherfuckin shine

[Verse 5]
I'm bustin fully automatic hollow point titanium for your cranium
the case was banned from the public
but the government ain't restrainin em, its rangin 'em out
anybody cross my line and I'm bangin you out
hangin you out, leavin you hemorrhagin out
aim, breath, and blast, (gunshot) wearin your
carcasses out, cleanin' cartridges out
when you, start to drift you better tell 'em bout the gunline boss, we empty clips
wether you blood or crypt, thug or hustler
you don't wanna trip with an AK, to your juggler
bang forever insane, thats how we bang
you better tell 'em bout the gunline boss, we killers mayn

(Layzie)
Meneski

[Verse 6]
It's those 5 on the gunline
It's all out war, on the frontline
Niggas bust a missile, don't you hear the whistle?
you busta you, I bust a K for dismissal
Talk shit, get licked by my pistol, hold up
Desperido, meneski mobbin' cause we Mo Thug
This ??? nigga ready to die whenever god decide
I'm bustin shots at yo ???  when you drive by
See niggas get eliminated, no escape
See niggas gettin wrapped up in yellow tape
See niggas lose they soul when they fuckin' with O
Theres no escape in the black hole
On the gunline

Tell 'em bout the gunline boss (better tell 'em) Ooh wee
Tell 'em, better tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em
(gunline, gunline) better tell 'em
Tell 'em
Tell 'em bout the gunline boss, (better tell 'em)

Better tell 'em
Meneski tell 'em

Tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em</pre>
