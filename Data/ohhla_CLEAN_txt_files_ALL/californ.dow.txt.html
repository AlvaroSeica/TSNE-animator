In Californ-I-A
Californ-I-A

[OG Sancho]
Californ-I-A, where the ballers ball and the players play
You're sweating just sitting in the sun, what can I say
Hopping to the beat until the mort, get out the way
Hey, ain't no stopping me S-A-deezy from making it tight
Step in the party, grab the mic and rip the shit up all night
It's OG Sancho in this bitch about to make it pop off
Making it hard like the beat, you see I just can't be soft
Ain't no way to avoid it, rolling international city
All the way to LA from San Diego, CA
And this message is brought to you courtesy of Sancho baby
And Mr. Shadow causing ruckus to start a melee
I'm quick to snatch a hoe so you won't even know I did it
Faster than the time it takes to light a spliff up and hit it
So don't fuck up the rotation
Just pass it to the nation, taxation upon representation

[Chorus]
In Californ-I-A
Where the ballers ball and the players play
Californ-I-A
We get high and we drink all day
In Californ-I-A
Shit, I couldn't have it no other way
Californ-I-A
In Cali

[Mr. Shadow]
In Cali We Live Rowdy, ain't nothing changed
Where the gangsters still claim and the dealers still slang
What's my name, Shadow, Amici Park banger
With Sancho in the back rolling primos out of Vegas
See motherfuckers hate us cuz we can't be touched
Set up shop in your hood and have you hoes bitched up
So what up, who in the fuck wanna step in my parameter
Test your nuts then I let off the caliber
So bow down or get your punk ass rushed
Around here it's no joke, we're getting high as fuck
Intoxicated, faded on the daily making cheddar
Worldwide gangsters down for whatever
I think it's better that you stay indoors
If I don't take his then I'm gonna take yours
Fake hoes ain't allowed, they get jumped by a crowd
Of some rowdy motherfuckers that be living down South

[Chorus]

[Mr. Shadow]
Now we're bouncing, lounging in this Golden State
Gotta give it to the homies that be pushing weight
It can't be no other way, I put that on my name
I'ma smoke bomb weed until my very last day
This game is hard to play if you got no balls
So bow to the don or feel my fist up on your jaw
Young outlaws blazing in dark alleys
Letting bitches know we don't play in Killer Cali

[OG Sancho]
Ice cold Corona Extras go down smooth
Sunny So Cal know how to make you move
Shaking like a dice game, hit em with the rhythm
Give em nothing but love or just give em a slug
But no matter what's the cause I gotta keep it Dago style
91950 Sancho in the gang file
Unlimited when my style's exhibited
I'm freaky when I flex, I'll make you shit and sit in it

[Chorus x2]</pre>
