[Intro]
This is a national security alert!!!
Ground Music! Flipmode! Aftermath! Here we go!!!

[Verse 1]
Back with the most venomous rap
It be the godfather of the club banger let me hear you clap
You can applause and from the very beginnin
You can give me a, standin ovation while I'm bangin your face in
With another banger I call it the cliff hanger
Watch me mangle and strangle this whole rap shit (COME ON!!!!)
You could see the way I make 'em mad sick
From down bottom the way I got 'em give me my cash quick (COME ON!!!!)
Log on you better grab onto somethin
Because I'm 'bout to shake shit again and make 'em black bitch (COME ON!!!!)
Now you hear the shots ring off from bitches takin everything off
Each other got 'em whylin runnin for cover
The King Kong Big Foot gully with a scully
Bully of rap still ugly with the money runnin the trap
Now they givin me dap, as far as I'm concerned in this mu'fucker
Like how I got 'em now they ready to snap!!!!

[Chorus]
SO DON'T TOUCH ME NIGGA!!!! (You might burn yourself!)
DON'T TOUCH ME NIGGA!!!! (You might burn yourself!)
It's gettin hot in this bitch! (So throw the water on 'em!!!!)
We got 'em hot in this bitch! (So throw the water on 'em!!!!)
We got 'em hot in this bitch! (So throw the water on 'em!!!!)
We got 'em hot in this bitch! (So throw the water on 'em!!!!)
HERE WE GO!!!

[Verse 2]
Now you see the alcohol spillin and we got 'em
Hands in the ceilin,  you know we only come to RATTLE the buildin
And break it on down just a little once again
Knowin we holdin the bank so let me keep the dice rollin
And keep it traditional the way I keep my money fallin
While you slackin on yo' mackin, Duke, we always keep it goin
Right to the left, do it to death, now watch me
Come through with a chisel that make the game sizzle
And I, pull out the skillet, prepare for the cookin
How I'm whylin niggas wonderin when I'm gonna bring the hook in
Thugs ice grillin everytime they get to lookin
Got 'em whylin overseas all the way back to GO BROOKLYN!!!!
Now they ready to spaz, cause we bring the best to them
Shit that shut it down on the regular, 
That's with the fly 80s' nigga that was whippin in a Cressida
Fresher than, most of these niggas, killin the rest of the
Fellas that was thinkin that they as rushin in and bustin in
But the way we was doin, we was musclin their hustlin!!

[Chorus]
SO DON'T TOUCH ME NIGGA!!!! (You might burn yourself!)
DON'T TOUCH ME NIGGA!!!! (You might burn yourself!)
It's gettin hot in this bitch! (So throw the water on 'em!!!!)
We got 'em hot in this bitch! (So throw the water on 'em!!!!)
We got 'em hot in this bitch! (So throw the water on 'em!!!!)
We got 'em hot in this bitch! (So throw the water on 'em!!!!)
HERE WE GO!!!

[Verse 3]
You don't really want it my dude
I'm sayin most my niggas is rude
and when we come we EAT a nigga food
Back to the fact in the matter at hand
For me to come in control this whole shit, was only part of the plan
The other part of the plan is for you to understand
That nothin could fuck with the kid, let me SAY IT AGAIN!!
The Broad Back B, Busta Bus back to put out the trash
And just for the record, we got it on smash, now
How the fuck they even got the audacity
The fire marshall come and try to talk about capacity
Everytime I'm in the spot,  I hope you know it has to be
Extremely packed to shut it down, YOU'LL PROBABLY CAUSE A TRAGEDY
Don't you know that when I'm in the place I change the mood again
I be whylin wit raunchy bitches and a bunch of HOOLIGANS!!
Now don't get it fucked up just because I flaunt it
Niggas think that they can test me, bring it if you really want it
See I be the type to always beat you to the punch faster
I keep a smile on my face, but carry the Bush-MASTER!!

[Chorus]
SO DON'T TOUCH ME NIGGA!!!! (You might burn yourself!)
DON'T TOUCH ME NIGGA!!!! (You might burn yourself!)
It's gettin hot in this bitch! (So throw the water on 'em!!!!)
We got 'em hot in this bitch! (So throw the water on 'em!!!!)
We got 'em hot in this bitch! (So throw the water on 'em!!!!)
We got 'em hot in this bitch! (So throw the water on 'em!!!!)
KEEP IT GOIN!!!!

[Verse 4]
You already kmnow I said it word to mother
Shit is so hot you niggas think it's cold in the summer
SHHHHH!!!!! Calm the noise down let's get a little quiet
Cause the neighbors call the police they know we cause riots
And they know that we'll have them thinkin they dancin with the devil
When they play the music turn the volume to the highest level
(*Busta Rhymes breathing taking a sigh) You got it right!
Let's keep the bomb goin like we lit a stick of dynamite
Bow you know you need to follow whenever you hear the God spit
(AWW SHIT!!!!) You see me nigga back in the cockpit
Out to gettin this money I give you all a stock tip
Perspire by a nigga till you see the sweat drop drip

[Chorus]
SO DON'T TOUCH ME NIGGA!!!! (You might burn yourself!)
DON'T TOUCH ME NIGGA!!!! (You might burn yourself!)
It's gettin hot in this bitch! (So throw the water on 'em!!!!)
We got 'em hot in this bitch! (So throw the water on 'em!!!!)
We got 'em hot in this bitch! (So throw the water on 'em!!!!)
We got 'em hot in this bitch! (So throw the water on 'em!!!!)
HERE WE GO!!!</pre>
