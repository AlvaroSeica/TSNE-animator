Ambition is a way of life, it's a mind set, ya followin'?

(M-M-M-M-Maybach Music)

[Rick Ross - Chorus]
Tats all on my arm
Bitch all up on my mind
I got stacks all up in my charm
My gold Rollie tell time
It's my ambition nigga (it's my ambition nigga)
I'm just so gifted nigga (look where that shit gets ya)

Tats all on my arm
Yo bitch all on my mind
And I got stacks on all my charms
My gold Rollie tell time
It's my ambition nigga (it's my ambition nigga)
I'm just so gifted nigga (look where that shit gets ya)

[Wale]
Okay, tats all on my arm
These dreads all in my eyes
I put these poems all in these songs
For the paper I'ma grind, it's my ambition nigga (it's my ambition nigga)
It's my ambition nigga (it's my ambition nigga)

Okay, tats all on my arm
These dreads all in my eyes
I put these poems all in these songs
Bitch all I know is this grind, it's my ambition nigga (it's my ambition nigga)
It's my ambition nigga (it's my ambition nigga)

[Wale - Verse 1]
I ain't with the talking, see I'm just tryna focus
'Cause the loudest nigga in the room is usually the brokest
Tryna stay clear of my foes, and these shape shiftin' ass hoes
Ya'll can't stick to no G-Code, see them snakes showing you more
Get my taste from all of my bitches
My mates calling me gifted, February cold as my heart
That's why your date is probably missing
Late for love and be trippin'
Man it takes cigar and start fillin'
I got a green bag with the blue strands
I smoke the Margerie Simpson
Got a broken heart that needs fixin'
And I don't rely on no bitches
And I don't reply to most BBM's
So when you see an R don't be trippin'
MMG obviously winnin', niggaz talk shawty we live it,
And I swear to lord I've been down to Earth
More times than not I be lifted

[Rick Ross - Chorus]
Tats all on my arm
Bitch all up on my mind
I got stacks all up in my charm
My gold Rollie tell time
It's my ambition nigga (it's my ambition nigga)
I'm just so gifted nigga (look where that shit gets ya)

[Wale]
Okay, tats all on my arm
These dreads all in my eyes
I put these poems all in these songs
For the paper I'ma grind, it's my ambition nigga (it's my ambition nigga)
It's my ambition nigga (it's my ambition nigga)

[Wale - Verse 2]
I ain't with the rappin', I'm just tryna focus
'Cause the loudest nigga in the room is usually the brokest
Bitch Tats all on my arm, these hoes say I'm that bomb
3 J's took me this high, 6 O's paid for my car
3 M's on my New Balance, I'm here to shine when I'm tracking
What you doing Ross, drop a hundred thousand and you know you Â‘posed to be stacking
I should Michael Jordan these rappers, man I'm twice as cold as these rappers
Ha ha, hold up, let me wipe a nose with these rappers
And I like the hoes to need passion,
And I like my girls with ambition
You see money talking these days and you thought the shorty wasn't listening
You ain't dreaming dog you ain't living
Even when I sleep I got vision
Even when ya deep, yeah still are sweat
I don't fiend for beef I eat bitches

[Rick Ross - Chorus]
Tats all on my arm
Bitch all up on my mind
I got stacks all up in my charm
My gold Rollie tell time
It's my ambition nigga (it's my ambition nigga)
I'm just so gifted nigga (look where that shit gets ya)

Tats all on my arm
Bitch all up on my mind
I got stacks all up in my charm
My gold Rollie tell time
It's my ambition nigga (it's my ambition nigga)
I'm just so gifted nigga (look where that shit gets ya)

[Wale]
Okay, tats all on my arm
These dreads all in my eyes
I put these poems all in these songs
For the paper I'ma grind, it's my ambition nigga (it's my ambition nigga)
It's my ambition nigga (it's my ambition nigga)

Okay, tats all on my arm
These dreads all in my eyes
I put these poems all in these songs
For the paper I'ma grind, it's my ambition nigga (it's my ambition nigga)
It's my ambition nigga (it's my ambition nigga)
