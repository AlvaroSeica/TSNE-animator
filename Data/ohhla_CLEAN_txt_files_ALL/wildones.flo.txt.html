[Intro/Chorus: Sia]
Hey I heard you were a wild one - oooooh
If I took you home it'd be a home run; show me how you do
I want to shut down the cluuuub, with you
Hey I heard you like the wild ones - oooooh

[Flo Rida]
Ohh, ah ah! I like crazy, foolish, stupid
Party goin wild, fist pumpin music, I might lose it
Blast to the roof, that how we do's it (do's it do's it)
I don't care tonight, she don't care we like
almost there, the right vibe, ready to get live
Ain't no surprise, take me so high
Jump and don't stop, surfin the crowd, oooooh
Said I gotta be the man
I'ma hit to my fans, mic check one twoooo
Shut 'em down in the club
where the playboy does 'til they all get loose
Loose, out the bottle
We all get bent 'til again tomorrow
Gotta break loose cause that's the motto
Club shut down, a hundred supermodels

[Chorus]

[Flo Rida]
Pa-pa-arty rocker, fa' sho' stopper
Mo' cham' bold, number one club popper
Got a hangover like too much vodka
Cain't see me with ten binoculars
So cool
No doubt by the end of the night got they clothes comin off
'til I make that mooove
Somehow, someway, gotta raise the roof, roof
All black shades when the sun come through
Uh-oh, it's on like everything goes
Round up baby 'til the freakin shows
What happens to that body is a private show
Stays right here, pri-private show
I like 'em untamed, don't tell me how pain
Tolerance, bottoms up with the champagne
My life, call my honey then we hit bang
Don't be easy with the bail, we get insane

[Chorus]

[Bridge: Sia] + Flo Rida
I am a wild one, break me in
Saddle me up and let's begin
I am a wild one, tame me now
Runnin with wolves and I'm on the prowl
  I show you another side of me
  A side you would never thought you would see
  Tear up that body, gotta make sure 'til you have enough
Actin like the wilds don't lie

[Chorus]
