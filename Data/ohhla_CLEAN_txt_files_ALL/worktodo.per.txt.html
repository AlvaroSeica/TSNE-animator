Song:   Work to Do
Typed by: dan-e-o.com

[Chorus]
I, I got work to do...
 
[Promise]
These days, it seems we can't make money like Drake money, right
Every week the government gon' take money, why?
Gotta check ten percent to RRSP
After rent spent, nothing left for artistry
Plus my wife's like hopefully he don't forget the groceries
I hope that he knows we got kids in these ovary eggs
But before one of 'em gets made
We need to see one of us get paid
None of it seems strange, it's the way that it is
It's just not the truth that we say to our kids, they fibs
Last week I had to ask my landlord
If there was anything in my crib he'd give cash for
All he asked for was my passport
I just need to make sure you pay me, that's all
So I ask I God, if first is You
Help me out, I got some work to do
 
[Chorus]
I, I got work to do...
I, I got work to do...
 
[Dan-e-o]
How long's it gonna take before I see money, bredren? The streets call me "legend"
But D's crummy spendin' receives funny mentions
Like truthfully, how long does a dude need to be doin' this
Before his pursuit of riches is deemed to be foolishness?
I use excuses like "the less I make, the less they take"
But that's so fake, see I just updated my resume yesterday
Drake's now world renown, Promise signed to Duck Down
That leaves Dan-e-o as the only one who's stuck now
It sucks how ain't nobody ever put me on
Come on Kanye or Wayne, or anyone hearing this song!
Somethin's wrong when your friends be askin' "what's happenin'"?
For the last time, that's it! Yes, I'm still rappin'!
Like I still breathe, still eat and still blink
And still think, "should I leave a tip for this drink?"
Cuz I might need the change, man this game really gets to me
I own a crib but can't afford my destiny
 
[Chorus]
I, I got work to do...
I, I got work to do...
I, I got work to do...
I, I got work to do...</pre>
