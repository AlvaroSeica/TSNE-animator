[Intro]
Hey there little fella
I know you missed me
Heh, you're a mean little fella aren't you?
{*animals growls*} You hungry?
{*some giant lizard type animals ROARS*}

[Female voice]
Chamillitary mayne...

[parody of the Taco Bell commercial]
Here lizard lizard lizard (uh)
Here lizard lizard lizard (Major Pain, Major Pain)
Here lizard lizard lizard (uh)
Here lizard lizard lizard (Major Pain)

{Here we go!}

[Chorus: Chamillionaire]
Hustles and my players, let's talk to these haters
Do yo' boy a favor, turn right to yo' neighbors
We got off the majors, but still do it major
Nobody can save ya, when Koopa bring that Major Pain
Left, left, left right left (Pain)
Left, left, left right left (Pain)
Left, left, left right left (Pain)
Left, left, left right left {Here we go!}

[Chamillionaire]
Nah I won't let them turn me pop
Even though my little niece like Justin Beiber
Yeah I made that song "Ridin' Dirty"
but that should let you know that I clutch a heater
Yeah I got played by Michael Jordan
I swear MJ he such a diva
Moral of the story is I don't care
Cause yeah I'm still here plus I don't need ya
Yeah I met a girl at Taco Bell
that slipped me her number in a fajita
Funny thing is I ain't order that
I took that hoe back and got her beat up
Why I gotta get back on my throne on
and keep turnin these fake fans to believers
Yeah I got a call from a major label
I swear hung up the receiver~!!

("If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again")
("If you need help, hang up and then dial your operator")

[Chamillionaire]
Do you wanna be successful so bad
that you know you would do whatever?
Would you be the one to jump the ship
to be safe or hold that ship together?
Would be the chick that try to leave
once you can't live like Cinderella?
Would you be broke and chill with God
or you would be rich and with the devil?
What you gon' do when the music stops
or would you still do this acapella?
That decision is really yours
and it really ain't much that I could tell ya
What I know is that I ain't you
With my words I'll be the realest ever
Chamillitary will rain forever
Just know I ain't talkin about the weather

[Outro: Chamillionaire]
Right and then a left (LEFT) right and then a left (LEFT)
March with me forever soldier take another step (STEP)
Right and then a left (LEFT) right and then a left (LEFT)
March with me forever soldier take another steeeeeeeep
This is for you know who and don't you ever be misled
I know just how I said it and I meant just what I just said
I feel as good as ever when I hop out of my bed
Baby you ain't livin life, you must be already dead

{*people screaming, helicopter flies overhead*}
{*BEEP BEEP, loud explosion, helicopter flies away*}

[Diddy-Dirty Money sample]
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Tell the world I'm coming home
Let the rain, wash away
All the pain of yesterday
I know my kingdome awaits
And they've forgiven my mistakes
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Tell the world I'm coming {*gun cocks, song ends*}</pre>
