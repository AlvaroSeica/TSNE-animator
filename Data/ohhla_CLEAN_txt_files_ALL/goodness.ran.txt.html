[Verse 1]
I was blessed wit a gift, both to teach and to spit
And I was taught to show grace when receiving a gift
I'm like a Fiend needing a hit, I'm pleading the fifth
Nah I got high on life, never needed a spliff
But dnt be takin me as, some kinda flake or a crab,
don't be makin me mad, cuz I don't play with the pad
That is unless it's the one that regularly come wit World Class Track Meet
cause the boys an athlete
We all been rhymin for years, but similarities end,
yall spitting into the wind- tryna make mine a career
That was an external rhyme, if yall ain't peep the design,
since boss there ain't been tracks deeper than mine
I used to write on my mirror in my tiny little room
That I would get large wit my tiny little tunes
And I ain't where I wanna be yet
But I'm closer than I was last week, baby steps I guess

[Hook]
We are- takin rap higher than ever-before
so come on get board if you wanna soar
you ain't gotta deal wit the frauds no more...
Don't be scared cuz we got that
Goodness
Random got the
K-Murdock got the
Dn3 got the
We all got the goodness
Come on in and get open of the sound
We got enough to go around

[Verse 2]
Call me the R wing co starring
K-murdock, here's a hearty meal cuz yall been starving
We all bring somethin fresh to the table
Forks and knives plastic, my raps ain't fatal
For my peeps out in Rochester sorry I'm late
a little health food break from the garbage plates
Taste good goin down, it's been heavily tested
my message so refreshing it's compared to a beverage
No MSG. Just a def mc an and producer on a MPC
blasting off like the spirit rover you couldn't see me
wit a kepler, I rep the, inner city and the steppers
Fox mccloud when I box em down
Got the naysayers optin out
They want me to stop but not right now
I got the blogs kinda hot right now, you see it...

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
All I wanted was a few spins, benzes wit new rims
never excited me so I tied up my loose ends
payin my dues, tried obeyin the rules
every night shacking at a different red roof inn
Its obvious the game need a hero
Yall look impressive, but you playin against kids, like tim tebow
Impregnable D, tryna be what I was destined to be
Whats thatÂ—I guess a legend emcee
Mega Ran, heavy hand strong mind-- a long line 
of greats preceeded me, so I thank yall for yall time
Fans lined up like ladies at the rest room
Constantly emailing awaiting my next move
I can't tell you cause I wouldn't be ran
All I can say is stay tuned, take a look at ya man
Chubby oak lane kid wit dimples and a dream
And makin money in rap ain't as simple as it seems
Couldnt have fun wit one gsme
Turn signal burned out cuz I can't stay in one lane
I move to video games then EGM's gone
But we gone keep it goin strong
Forever Famicom, perform then we gone
A jiggle to the left and the right and we on
Eons beyond what you consider the norm
My songs is psalms, that's the crusade we on, let's go...
