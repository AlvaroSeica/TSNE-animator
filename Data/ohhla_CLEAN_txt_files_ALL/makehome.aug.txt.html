[August Alsina]
I don't always do what I should, but I do what I gotta do
When you've been at the bottom, you see the hunger inside of you
Don't say what you won't do cause it can all change
When the going gets tough it'll drive you insane
See I done dodged a couple shots, served a couple blocks
Hit a couple corners tryna shake a couple cops
A broke a couple rules, didn't graduate from school
Cause I was busy hustling when I thought that shit was cool
See I gotta keep it real with you baby
Cause the shit I used to do is what made me
And I'm hopin I ain't gotta go back to the trap
Cause we really know that we don't want that

[Chorus: August Alsina]
But if I don't make it home tonight, tell my mama that I love her
Leave some flowers for my brother; girl I love ya
But if I don't make it home tonight, take some money to my sister
I don't ever want her chasin after niggas
Cause where I'm from, niggas out'chea dyin every day
And they ain't all bad, they're just tryna make a way
And I ain't no different, so if I get missin
These are my last wishes, I hope you get them right
Girl if I don't make it home tonight

[August Alsina]
I know it's harsh
But this is how I feel, girl it's comin from the heart
I hope it doesn't end the way it had to start
Cause it started out bad but I made it this far
But everybody tryna see me make it
Or they only wanna see me win so they can take it
Cause I know it's hard to find a job, so niggas kill and rob
There's a chance that I won't make it here tomorrow
Being honest cause I gotta keep it real with you baby
Cause the shit I used to do is what made me
And I'm hopin I ain't gotta go back to the trap
Cause we really know that we don't want that

[Chorus] w/ ad-libs

[Jeezy]
Let's go~!
... Would you miss me? Would you miss me? (Hah)
Would you walk up to my casket? Would you kiss me?
My life is schizophrenic, I'm just tryin' to stay sane (sane)
Pour a cup full, hope it take away the pain (yeeeah)
I said you know I-I-I-I, came from the projects, nigga (AY)
Don't care if it kill me, I die, I'll stay in the projects (yeeeah)
You know I'm fresh as a mothafucka (fucka) in case that I die tonight (DAMN)
Got a lot on my mind, you know that I'm high tonight (whoo!)
I left that black Hublot at home so really I don't got the time (nah)
My nigga got by a quarter, heard that he dropped the dime (dine)
Failure's no option nigga (nah) you out of yo fuckin mind
Mixin my life and my freedom fool (whassup) so ain't none of you stoppin' mine (AY)

[Chorus] - 2X w/ ad-libs</pre>
