...It's not about the salary
I do this so MC's think twice before they battle me
Cause Lonnie B can really flow shit (say what!)
This ain't no wo, thuggish ruggish, bow wow, yippie yo shit
I through yo rappers like a bad poker hand
(Now tell me, Biggedy B, the man, yeah!)

[Lonnie B]
Yeah, my rhymes style's scandalous leavin MC's in bandages
So many niggaz on my dick now I feed them semen fuckin sandwiches
Hardcore when I throw rappers to the flow
Battlein me is like giving birth to a fuckin dinosaur
Fuck wack niggaz it's my turn
So how you gon' rap the microphone 
and come weak in a motherfucking rock sperm
Mad Skillz got this fucking mig on
I suck ya blood out motherfuckers 
like Tom Cruise with the wig on
Yeah about to make the loop
Cause I can keep motherfucking rap until Biz Markie gets cute
AAAAAiiigghhttt!

Where you from, you gotta be from Brooklyn man, you gotta be!

Na B nah, I ain't from Queens
Oh! I've got it, that nigga from Uptown, he gotta be!
