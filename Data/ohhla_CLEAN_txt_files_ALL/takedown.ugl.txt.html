[Andy Cooper]
Alright, stop, come on, man
Stop me, come on, relax, just relax
Come on..

Let's go..
The blood starts pumping, the mind's alert
The goal is in focus, time to work
I got raw nerves and a loss for words
So you better not knock, do not disturb
My heart palpitates insatiable
Follow my nose, aimed at a place to go
On the path I'm a pack of jungle cats
I can hunt as long as the hunger lasts (Uh-huh)
I'm looking for a yes and I hate resistance
You can break it down to the basic instincts
Not gonna wait, better make it instant
Or else stand back at a safer distance
(Shhh) Demons whispering
A little idea telling me it's the thing
So I dive down deep to apply surprise
Like a great white killing with lifeless eyes
I might try to stop but I'm out of control
And I'm not cooling off so now that you know
Don't allow me to blow cause I doubt I can hold
And I'm about to--AHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!

[Chorus 2x: Andy Cooper]
You better give it to me
It's the take down
Give it to me, give it to me, give it to me
I'll take you down

"Deep down inside you know you're wrong."

[Dizzy Dustin]
Ah man, just relax, it's not that bad

"Cause you took it too far and it's time to stop."

[Dizzy Dustin] + (Andy Cooper)
Wait, take one minute to think
You gotta stay calm, you're on the brink
Of disaster, pause and catch yourself
Let's make some calls and get some help
You need to understand what a mess you're in
Before I notify your next of kin
It's not that bad, your life's a wreck
And I came to serve the reality check
You think that you're slick and sliding by
When you sit there sipping on cyanide
With the people in your life left high and dry
And don't try to hide those lying eyes
(What do you know?) I know you're wrong
I know that it's bad and it can't go on
(What do you want me to do?) Admit it!
(Admit it) Tell me that I'm right

[Andy Cooper]
Forget it!
I'm out of here and if I burn a bridge (*fuck*) you
I don't know if I'll return to this
See, it's too late to manipulate
A twist of fate and a lucky break
I am what I am, not a role I can act
And there's no going back and you don't know the half
So if you want to judge and find a fault
I'll bring this talk to a grinding halt
Come on!

[Chorus 2x: Andy Cooper]
Just give it to me
Cause it's the take down
Give it to me, give it to me, give it to me
You better take him again!
Give it to me, give it to me, give it to me
You know, it's the take down!
Give it to me, give it to me, give it to me
Give it to me, give it to me, give it to me
Give it to me!
Did you know, I'll take you down!

"Deep down inside you know you're wrong" (So?)
"Cause you took it too far and it's time to stop"
Man, save that shit
"I'm like a time bomb!"
That's true! For what? "I will not stop!"
What you going do, man?

"Before training begins, prepare quietly for the moment of action.
Being great, it floats far into the universe, having gone far, it returns.
Remember, mastering others requires force. Mastering the self means strength."</pre>
