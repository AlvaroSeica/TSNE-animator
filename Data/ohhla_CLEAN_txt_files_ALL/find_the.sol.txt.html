Typed by: Cno Evil

[Chorus: Solomon Childs]
She, could be all the way from Texas
Or just got off the plane, from Dominican Republic
Wherever she comes from, I want hook-up
Please can someone, help me find that one

[Solomon Childs]
I've searched alot of places, I've been alot of places
All kinds of Coca-Cola shapes and faces
All kinds of shades and races
My momma say that I should have patience
But she don't understand, it's easier said than done
And she already got somebody to love, somebody to hold
When the brib is cold, somebody to roll with
Who wont fold the cards, or leave a heart scarred
She always tell me 'Ryan, I love you'
And maybe what you looking for is in front of your face
Or maybe you can't see it, cuz you moving at a faster pace
So embrace the Lord's face or you'll never chase

[Hook: Solomon Childs]
Where do I find her? Where does she hang out?
Who does she be with, what is she into?
Where do I find you?

[Chorus]

[Solomon Childs]
I walk up on the beautiful ones, and they keep on walking
Maybe it's not me, maybe it's the fact that dudes show no action
And just alot of talking, certain security's men look for in a women
And set his mind at ease, and give him the confidence with support of cushion
And keep his hustle pushing, keep his 9 to 5 pushing
His 5 to 9 cooking, gourmet meals, twenty's on the wheels
Enough to have a player retire in there, true story
So understand if she play hard to get, she just might be worth the wait
Worth the chase, worth the sweat

[Hook]
