[Intro]
Virtuoso!
Yo...

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
+ONE+, love to all my brothers burnin buddha
You know time to pass it +TWO+, your lady baby girl
You drive me crazy so you know I break +THREE+
Some said it son want war we gon' hit 'em with the +FOUR+

[Virtuoso]
To you lyrical pickpockets riding on my dick rocket
You know what I spit shock it so hard it's like I stick sockets
with a fork then metamorph into the Human Torch
I'm smokin reefer on my porch at the New York police force
I'm three-fourths out to lunch, half out to dinner
I'm a loser, I'm a winner, I'm an expert beginner
I'm a saint slash sinner, I paint my paint thinner
I'm the only one in my, league there's no contenders
No one to end the, rain sleet hail snow
like a whale's blowhole the lungs of Virtuoso
Stay submerged under liquid for six hours
It's absurd but I spit with sick power, every verse is like a syphilis shower
Bitch how're you gonna stop the Juggernaut?
You're not cause "I'm the juggernaut bitch~!"
You know I can't be stopped so stop talkin shit and eat a dick
And if you pussy eat a chick then you gon' hear the heater click
Difference between crystal and African blood diamonds
You spit for the shine, I shed red from the head, I love rhymin
Fuck Simon, do what Virt says, +Americans+ are +Idol+
Standin rival, Osama stay tearin up your bibles
It's not fair for any rivals while they stuck on their survival
I'm risin just like a tidal wave, they dreadin my arrival
It's time to remind you the tricks that my mind do
So rewind your time, I just designed a new swine flu and I'm about to blind you
Up at the firin range, you'll be retirin, we stay perspirin
You fuckin with Mufasa fallin in the lion's den
I'm high again from rollin up riboflavin and niacin
I'm piled in proteins, your flow need Virtuoso vitamins
I'm stiflin your air flow so them chemicals can pile in
A pyro in a room filled with kerosene and a lighter
Then I spark a black up like a shark attack, I rip apart a rapper
Leave him to scratch it now scrappily ever after you bastard

[Chorus] - 2X

[Virtuso]
I missed the Obi Wan too, three at horizontal
Mister "I can fuck just about any girl I want to"
I burn through cheese like fondue, left on the stove too long dude
Don't say I didn't warn your crew, I'm 'bout to bomb you
This mic's a kamikaze, the mamis wanna ride me
After this Maserati they can't drive a jalopy
This is not a hobby, get out of the lobby
The game's not hirin, it's firing, go get a job B
Your mommy slobbed me, she gots a lot of body
The crew can get the shotty, cause them a gang of batty
men and we be the batty bwoi killers
Colin Powell filler, Magilla Gorilla
I spilled a funk flow the odor tear through the air
Like I ate asparagus spears then drank Bavarian beer
Put the cherry '70 Chevy in gear
I love your derriere my dear let's clear up outta here your man's a queer
Hear when life give you midgets gotta stack 'em 'til they big as Himalayan ridges
I figure I got to watch my riches
Cause I be the rap sphinx, the rhyme and riddle king
And you're not a fly guy, just look at your little wings
Just look at my fist of rings, hear how the pistol sings
Michelin tires couldn't get a grip on this terrain
I'm gifted as a Christmas cane and if you miss my name
I miss to stick my dick in Lindsay Lohan's firecrotch until I'm pissin flames
I got em suicidal, blame it on the rain
I'm poppin two inside you, you can blame it on my aim
I can't miss, I'm like DaVinci with the canvas
A fat boy with the sandwich, a wildlife conservationist
with pandas like Ansel Adams' hands on the camera
I hit you with the propaganda, I'm cockin hammers
like carpenters building verandas
And I'm always at an advantage like a young Sampras when I brandish
this mic in my hand, it's like rice in Japan
It's bare necessity, a staple in the secret recipe
See~! Your laws bore me, cause I've been havin orgies since 14
They filled my baby bottle up with morphine
I cordially invite you to try and write like the titan
You're more likely to win a headbuttin fight with a bison
Besides when, I begin then, there's no stoppin me
'til I got the uh, what's that name for runnin the game? Monopoly!!
