[ VERSE 1: Oddisee ]
I was never one to let things go easy, believe me, I wish I could let it all fly
I know it's not classy but when life pass me, I stare and I whistle as the gal walk by
My mother taught me better, she learned it from the hood
Don't bother chasin gold, be complacent with the wood
But I was like whatever, I'm never one to listen
I ventured into woods other people wouldn't dare
Entitled like I'm rich, so I always thought I could
In the world not a care when you're full of ambition
Followin the trails to the cities made of myths
Legendary tales took me there to make a hit
I got up to the door when I wasn't on the list
Opportunity with scrutiny, I'm soon to be dismissed
But I was on a mission so I was like
Yeah, I'm kind of a big deal, let me in, I got a gift

[ CHORUS ]
You've got to let it go
Sometimes you got these problems on your mind
And you should always know
That people'll tell you, you'll solve them, you'll be fine
But I don't believe that, you see that's the way of bein lazy
If you want it gotta get it
If confronted and you quit it
Then you're nothin but a victim in the system that we live in
But forgiven if you wanna try again

[ VERSE 2: Oddisee ]
I'm a man of faith but I'm not a man that waits
I don't plan on fate, I plan on me to make a plate
In other words I don't bitch, I never walk away
When things fall apart, I build 'em back, I don't ditch
Foldin under pressure, carry more than I can take
Knees buckle from the weight, never sore from the lift
Never came to grips with the fact that I gotta sit back
With the cards I was dealt when I play
I want a better hand so I'm puttin mine together
Not to the sky but the plans that I make
The strength been given, I be damned if I break
It's brains over brawns, at my weakest when I'm clever
In my twelfth hour when my mom start to pray
It's fifteen till, still tryina persist
About a minute left when belief starts to shake
A brother at his best movin mountains till they shift

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 3: Oddisee ]
And what about the times you give it your all
And you still fall short of what were you resort
Course we bounce back but there's times the force of the smack tells us we should abort
In fact, fair line between
Retract and react and the action of pride and the lack of a spleen
And what happens collide when passion and passive behavior
Can clash on the grasp of a dream on impact
And it seems lettin go could be a savior
At times holdin on could end up bein more labor
So I'm cool when I don't get the girl
When I'm shootin for the stars then I'll probably hit the world
It's not bad for bad aim
If anything my shortcomings show that I have range
And that's real
I'ma leave it up to God, God'll leave it up to Odd
We'll see what'll happen
Chill
