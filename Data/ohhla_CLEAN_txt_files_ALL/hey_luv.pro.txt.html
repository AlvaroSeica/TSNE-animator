Hey love

[ VERSE 1 ]
Females are shady as they wanna be (wanna be)
Out for the cheese, but they wanna beef
Slidin to the side, but you can't see over me
We gon' keep it real, to the glass, let the MoÃ«t spill
How you feel, is you wantin me? (ah-ah)
Well, money shady, make a lady act ficticiously
That's why I love it, baby can't get close to me
I built a gate, hawk-eye the game closely
That's why I'm straight, what these thugs thinkin of
Tryin to split me and my love
We gon' flow like a dove sack to hit em back
Cause I saw it, hummin, comin at me
These fools bustin and it's comin rapidly
Don't you know me, homie? I'm about what you about
Peep, creep while you sleep, clean your whole stash out
20 g's all dubs, player, what you got
Smokin hay with my love, keep spendin, won't stop

[ CHORUS ]
Hey love
May I have a word with you
I lied to you, yeah
Guess what I been going through

[ VERSE 2 ]
I used to think you love everything I stood about
Never once did you doubt the fact I'll make it out
This ghetto, push a Benz, D Troop, Wayne and Twins
Bust a broad, call a friend, it's off the heezy once again
Let em never come between us, never take us to the cleaners
Steady dippin out the backdo' with Funky Cold Medina
I seen it in her eyes, analyze, play the game too
Don't be sloppy, boo, or I be droppin you
Off at your mama's house, no Jerry Springer bout
Cause that's the felony, that's what they tellin me
And it's my word like a spelling, bee
I rather see Pam Grier round here, Foxy Brown with me
Except you stay around, lie, clown, die with me
Split the pie 50/50 eye to eye with me
That's on the game, mack gotta be
The best on the west, start a worldwide lottery

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 3 ]
How many women out here want a million
Graduate, then wait to have children
How many girls out there with five babies
Waitin for a 'I do', but you're 'I maybe's
Baby, I want a fly lady, 5-Mercedes
Body lookin damn good, still drive me crazy
The kind that like the ice watch cause it freeze time
Don't ask the price on that cause I gees mine
I'm a city slicker from a slicker city
Baby from the country, so she brick-buildin titty
I'm on the West coast, so I'm one of those boys
To match up the preacher daughter with the homeboy
How many women out there want a million
Graduate, then wait to have children
How many girls out there with five babies
Waitin for a 'I do', but you're 'I maybe's
