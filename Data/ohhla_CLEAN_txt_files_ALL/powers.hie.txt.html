[Opio]
They say I'm like Bruce Willis...Unbreakable, Die Hard
Ture Sickness with this mic on the tripod
But I'm not Chow Yun Fat
Dig I'm still a pillar of stone
Flows enter your skulls
Mash on your whole malitia like I'm Hannibal
Imagine you the antelope, and I'm the king of the jungle
Animal instict...phenominal stamina
Just think about a man on the brink of insanity
And it's me!
You not a rapper, you a movie star checkin who we are
Be the coup d'état...molotov cocktail
Check and you'll get scarred and schooled regardless
I'm marvelous majestic...no retarded shit
All my power harnessin'
My spoken word like a voltron sword
And these palms pulse the arsenic
Every medely...deadly!
Come and spark with us

[Tajai]
When the instrumental begins
The timid...they wince
They know when it's gonna commence
We bout to crush 'em
Reach out and touch 'em
Before they scream out
We gonna pull these things out and bust 'em
Rub 'em out like dry erase
Thug it out like the United Snakes (sssss)
It's us against the world
Fuck popular opinion!
They scoff cause we was different
But we did it all for independence
Now we gon' off 'em with a vengeance
Hand on they heads!
Paint the landscape ruby red
With the nerve and will of a bunch of determined killers
Who always make their marks, and never hesitate to spark
Strike first, take their hearts with the right verse
Cause confusion
Never underestimate the power of illusion we usin'
Start a whole revolution of music, man we do this!
Shit it's all we know!

[Chorus] X 4
The powers that be
It's in you
It's in me
An Emcee
That's all we know..

[Del]
Whatever, I don't know why you even play yourself to that degree
You laugh at me?
Like I won't slap the teeth out your grill
That's how I feel
You out of order
You about a quarter inch away from fist in face
Your distant gaze makes me think your brain drifts away
To a land of wonder, only to awaken by the sound of cannon thunder
All of those damn assumptions!
You a sad sack, mad wack
Straight up and down ass-crack
And that's that!
Get a load of Del, I devise words well
I be spittin globe
Let the mission unfold
Your just a pretty centerfold
Hate to diss ya ho, but you're fictional
I'm just kinda different yo...what I say is thought provoking!
Not for joking
See I know things they told kings
While your hos cling to whatever the dough brings

[Chorus] X 1
The powers that be
It's in you
It's in me
An Emcee
That's all we know..

[Pep Love]
Hieroglyphics came triumphant reign...uncontained
Runnin through the plains of some hunted slaves
Emperors who were meant to be entered into the end of the world
As we spin to the heat of the sun's temperature...hot!
Distance measure how many flows I got
Persistent pressure as we get this cheddar
For the business and the betterment of my folks
All my green stars mount up
Ready let's go!
We sustain out of Earth cause we came outta her
The devils get slain when I sling slang
Hotter then a lot of lava from Barbeta to Bahamas
All the way to (some island?)
We parlé'in, clokcin dollars like good fellas
Suckas get jealous cause we make lettuce and we still rebelious
And the industry could never jail us
All my niggaz free to be ourselves and our record still sell!
This is hip hop Olympics
Hieroglyphics the Dream Team
Rappers livin outta they means, tryin to bling bling
Get your fat chain stole!
Get your whole crew exposed
We done had them hos, dog!
I'm magical and when I grab these flows
Out the hat it blows 'em back to the last 3 rows
We mashin, massive action-packed shit
Hit 'em with a passion and that's it!

[Chorus] X 4
The powers that be
It's in you
It's in me
An Emcee
That's all we know..</pre>
