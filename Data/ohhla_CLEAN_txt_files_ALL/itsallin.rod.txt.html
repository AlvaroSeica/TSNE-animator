Typed by: Cno Evil

[sample]
I look at all the lonely people...

[Li-Mouse]
What this? It's all in a dream
Nile River flows, fresh waters that stream
Providing the energy, to afford the light
Like blood through veins, I feel, I feel nice
I saw myself on stage, in front of a mass
Spitting knowledge, to many like I was in a class
There body convulses in the beat of Cno drums
I know my fans are smart, there will be no bums
They can decipher my lines, I spit on the tracks
The dumb need more time, like a dial-up fax
Traveling on airplanes, to perform in all the nations
Paralyzing soundwaves, broad casted on stations
I made a video, that ain't have no flashy shits
All my real cats backing me up before I made hits
Yeah, that's how it will be, you can bet on that
If these fucking labels stop signing faggots that are wack
Big house, new car, but I still have my 'Lude
To remind me how I always felt, mad screwed
Them chicks out there, don't look at me twice
But now that I got fame, they call themselves mice
Heh, I'd have a queen, my real Cleopatra
Real genuine chick, not no lame ass actor
Why is always that, always that I'm after
In order to make the dream true, money is the factor

[Cno Evil]
Money is the fear, for those above me, say a prayer
For the killas, be aware, life is unfair
DNA strands in your hair, just a fragment of a care
Just the passion of this here, is like the crashing of a cymbal
Prince of Egypt like a symbol, hieroglyphic exquisite
Horses in the dark, nightmares what you vision
Dollars Rule Everything Around Me, D.R.E.A.M.'s, ain't they funny?
My seed shall roam in these streets, I call him Sunny
Shining in New York and rhyming in New York
Born, walk, crawl, run, hide and die in New York
With a knife and a fork, cut this beef into pieces
Divide the land into portions, for my nephews and my nieces
Make wine from water, for my precious little daughter
All those who oppose, will get blowed to they chest
Become slaughtered and destroyed
Like a child with a brand new toy
Tears roll down cuz he didn't have no time to enjoy
These are just decoys, to keep their minds off of drugs
When bullets hit the brains, how can they keep their minds off of slugs
Minds on the hugs, kisses, the blisses
To resist the lust and temptations of the little misses
It's in the dream, yes, but it seems it's in a scheme
And to rule this hip hop, the antidote is in a team
Vibrations and sound waves are in a theme
And the light that shines in your eyes is in a beam

[Chorus 2X: Li-Mouse]
It's all in a dream...
It's all in a dream...
It's all in a dream...
It's all in a dream...</pre>
