[Game]
Everybody fuckin Amber Rose
Is the pussy good? Only Kanye and Cameron knows
And who this Tammi hoe?
Tellin me and Trey shootin a video in a month and she can get a cameo
S-M-H, T-T-M, five star, we be them
L-O-L, hide my B-B-M, ain't got my B-B-M
Lou' Vuitton, he be in, 'trón got 'em queasy and
My +Money+ ain't +Young+, that's my nigga Lil' Weezy an' dem
I keep one rolled like Wiz Khalifa an' dem
Got some college hoes what wanna smoke a Swisher Sweet with him
They ain't no Lauren Londons but they got that Meagan Good
They use that Photoshop to get they ass up out the hood
And it's alllll good with us niggaz mayne
I said it's alllll good cause I'm with Trigga mayne
Yeah, she say she wanna have Jayceon kid
I told that bitch you better off with Jason Kidd

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
Ohhh-ohhh-ohhh-ohhhhh! I do it cause they love it
If you hate it bitch who give a fuck? I made it
Ohhh-ohhh-ohhh-ohhhhh! Plus I do it for the ladies
Somebody say they wanna have my baby
Ohhh-ohhh-ohhh-oh - she said she wanna have my baby
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh - who tryna have my baby?
Ohhh-ohhh-ohhh-oh - she said she wanna have my baby
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh - she said she's tryna have my baby
Ohhh-ohhh-ohhh-ohhhhh!

[Game] + (Trey Songz)
How many bitches in the club just to try to fuck a platinum rapper? (mmm)
Pokin microscopic holes into the Magnum wrappers (talk to 'em now)
Hoppin on the dick but I ain't throwin karats at ya
You ain't gon' WorldStar me, I ain't your average rapper (ooh!)
You drinkin all the Goose then bitch I ain't finna pay
You don't look like your Twitter avatar anyway (ooh!)
Bitch you look like an Avatar anyway
And that's the same bitch that was stalkin Fab', ain't it Trey? (YUP~!)
And this is how I know you're givin free head
If you was gettin paid, the +Bottom+ of your shoe would be Red
But it ain't, she claimin she a saint
But as soon she see Dwight she goin hard in the paint (yeah-yeahhhh ohhh)
But her girlfriend the type you wanna take home
Throw a little Drake on, it really shouldn't take long
Then she told me that she wanna meet Trey Songz
I told that bitch strip and start singin all Trey's songs (C'MERE!)

[Chorus]

[Trey Songz]
Yeahhhh~!
Tell your boyfriend that your real nigga's home
Toast to fake fuckers cause the real nigga's gone
My head blown, hit and kill plus the 'trón
I love the beat, it shot and she live for the Songz
YEAH! You know what I'm about
The only muh'fucker the ladies won't do without
She wan' have my baby so my baby's in her mouuuuuuth
I'm so crazy!!
Five-star suite shorty, I'm soaked baby
Red all over cause The Game's in here
And we don't give a fuck about the lames in herrrrre
You niggaz is queer!
Run over you niggaz like you niggaz is deer
You niggaz is last year
Niggaz so pussy I should call y'all Pap Smear
Yeah, I'm so wholesome
E'rywhere I go a nigga ask me to hold some'n
They wanna be like me when they grow up
And I ain't grew up yet, shit I ain't blew up yet
Millions in the bank and I ain't made me a buck yet
Haha, so I guess y'all upset
Lookin 'round the club like, who I'ma fuck next?
She says she wanna have my chiiiiiild
I say gimme a Black &amp; Mild

[Chorus]</pre>
