[Verse 1]
I've caught myself starrin' at the wall
It's kinda hard cause some barely believin' think my life is gone
Playin' the father figure to my little brothers and sisters
Mama always had it hard so now I'm beggin' for riches
Got my mind based on dirty games how could I change
When I'm stuck in the flames feelin' nothin' but pain
A juvenile couldn't crack a smile
I'm only 5 feet prayin' for another mile, when will they find me
Drownin' in my own blood, demons behind me
Clownin' while we slang drugs clutchin' my nine free
Bustin' at them fuckin' scrubs, I wish they'd try me
Just knowin' how the block was, we couldn't find peace
Hopin that they give me love
At times I couldn't sleep until a nigga got a buzz
Burnin' the streets deep
I'm still runnin' for that major league
I hope you understand the game that they given me

[Chorus]
Hatin' niggas wanne take my life, my life
Cops tried to lock me up last night, last night
But nigga I don't give a fuck about them
Cause they don't give a fuck about me, they don't give a fuck about me
With all the pain i've seen in bein raised a G
I'm screamin' fuck tha world (I'm screamin' fuck tha world)
I'm screamin' fuck tha world (I'm screamin' fuck tha world)
They don't give a fuck about me

[Verse 2]
It was my elevation that got me ready to ride
Reinsertin' revelations had be ready to die
I closed my eyes and pictured better days
I'm like a walkin' fuckin' bomb with a box of grenades
Somebody help me I've been troubled since guns burst
Even worse leavin' cars with dents
What is worse black hurts families died within'
But now it's crazy cause we livin' in hell
Where everythin' is hot includin' cells
We try to make an honest
Where every move we made wed wind up back in prison
So I say fuck it with my pistols and rhyme
Another young motherfucker with an everlastin' crime
They tried to murder my spirit but barely took it away
I wasn't perfect you heard it in every lyric I'd say
It was curtains for burdens and now the bodys that lay
We been deserted they heard it and now we makin' em pay

[Chorus]
Hatin' niggas wanne take my life, my life
Cops tried to lock me up last night, last night
But nigga I don't give a fuck about them
Cause they don't give a fuck about me, they don't give a fuck about me
With all the pain i've seen in bein raised a G
I'm screamin' fuck tha world (I'm screamin' fuck tha world)
I'm screamin' fuck tha world (I'm screamin' fuck tha world)
They don't give a fuck about me

[Verse 3]
When I feen for the moment
I see my opponent stay on me like I got a warrant
I'm pistol packin' now they eyes on it
We been abused and accused of shit we didn't do
I made a move now these fools got a fuckin' issue
Assassinate my adversaries cause they livin' to die
Wanna see me buried now so my kids can cry
Askin' all these questions, mama where my daddy at
Sick as hell in cells got me thinkin' I ain't comin' back
I kept a tight hand
I'm paranoid can't afford to be sleepin' with my pistol on my night stand
Skipped school to make moves with my roaddogs
I had to chose between goons or the school yard
Books were sweet but the streets was me
I fell in love with gangbangin' cause I had to eat
Became a victim of a system of tragic endin's I recommended
Apologies for this thug image
(Fuck tha world!)

[Chorus]
Hatin' niggas wanne take my life, my life
Cops tried to lock me up last night, last night
But nigga I don't give a fuck about them
Cause they don't give a fuck about me, they don't give a fuck about me
With all the pain i've seen in bein raised a G
I'm screamin' fuck tha world (I'm screamin' fuck tha world)
I'm screamin' fuck tha world (I'm screamin' fuck tha world)
They don't give a fuck about me</pre>
