They say rap is outta control, word to Von Pea
Emcees are great mimics I'm just tryinna do me
Not even feeling myself, numb to the pain
The metaphors get abused they take it in vein/vain
This is our brain on drugs, your brain on weed
My mind on women which one should I need
Rappers tell me that I should be chasing that green
But they don't tell you what to do when the lights are blue
And the white doors open, and they padlock you
Or when they click-clacked dude, bullets'll breeze by you/bayou
Louisiana style murder mixed with Cajun food
Scrimps for dollars, pimps pop collars
Chicks'll get dissed when they drop it down proper
Found myself in a strip club with a young bopper
Wondering what should I tell her
She's just trying to make a living
meanwhile I'm staring at her hips imagining how I'd make a killing
Mami don't touch me, cos I don't wanna touch you
She whispers in my ear that I should just get comfortable
It was all a dream till my eyes got BIG
And I saw fame and riches and attention I never did
(but I) Was raised to be humble on the backs of prophets
Taught the Scriptures and learnt to save all my pockets
That's why I never overspend when I'm up in the spot
Cos I ain't trying to prove to you that I got a whole lot
I question why we're suckers and feed into the nonsense
I've come to understand that's the human nature in us
Dear Father don't judge us, I know that you love us
And hope that all of us would one day come to repentance
Until then I'mma just keep scribing these verses
Hoping young folks will open scrolls and keep they purses
'Cos after you pop them bottles you'll piss it all and flush it
Discover after you hit her man the sex just ain't worth it

HOOK

But its ooooonnnn
What you've been looking for in life has been right in front of you  the 
whole tiiiiiiiimmeeee
And I hope with all the strife that you've lived with all this time makes 
you wiiiiiiiiiiiseeeeee
Cos its not worth it of your time if you learnt nothing from this crazy 
liiiiiiiiiifeeeeeee
For what is real is not out there but only right where it should be 
insiiiiiiiideeeeee

(Man I hope that the life that we're living right now is for reeeeeaaaaaal)

Man I hope that you live right (live right)
I pray you don't die young (don't die)
and grow old till an age ripe
and eat the fruits of your labor when its all said and done (done)
Mami I hope that you think twice (think twice)
Bruh I hope you tried to pay the price (pay it forward)
Cos what should a kid/ born into this world without a father have think of 
their birthright?
Man how could you even sleep at night
Knowing you sowed a seed and yet that you took flight
Forgive my passionate speech I'm just trying to understand
What makes a man become a dead beat, Dad
Like losing your hearing to a talking drum
Or shouting out loud and no one can hear you scream
Son, It's a nightmare on Elm Street
And yet the game is Freddier Kruger killing all these kids' dreams
Sometimes I wish I had fast cars
Lived a fast life courting model superstars
Used to wish I was an athlete
Till I saw them dudes don't last/ Not For Long/ in the pro league
Always felt there was a better way
A better way to rap a better way to get paid
Better stage to act a better take on wordplay
So when they claim that they're better
I just shrug cos you ain't heard of me...yet

REPEAT HOOK

Refrain (high pitch): She may, She might but I hope she won't</pre>
