[Intro: Craig David]
Oh no! Look at who they let in the back door
It's been 7 days so let's roll
From the UK to Brooklyn they know
Craig David, Mos Def, and Premo
When we step on the mic we too cold
This remix might fracture your nose

[Verse 1: Mos Def]
uh huh, wah, ah hah, say wah, wah, you dun know....
Now look alive and clap your hands to it
Sexy mammies in the house shake and dance to it
My hard heads in the place don't act stupid
It's not Craig and Big Mos can't do it
Get that ass movin, from the front to back to it
Puttin that thumpin back to it
It's that music to set it off and get the mass movin
Yo tell dem 'bout that shorty you came through with

[Craig David]
I met this girl in the subway, walkin my way
It must have been my day
Seem like the perfect match for me, so she said to me
Craig can you give me what I wan't?
I don't know about you but I feel so good
Girl I can make you feel real hot tonight
So I said baby we can do it in the pourin rain
Do it again do it again till you call my name
Girl you got me insane can't maintain the speed in the fast lane
Or we can do it on the telephone, fakin moans
Make you groan all night long yeah
Or we could do it on the down low, or when your all alone

Chorus:
Craig David (DJ Premier's scratch sample)
Cause it was ooooooh, on monday
And it was (...Two!) on tuesday
And it was ooooooohhh on wednesday
Gave her what she wanted through to sunday
Ooooooh, on monday
And it was (...Two!) on tuesday
And it was ooooooohhh on Wednesday
Gave her what she wanted through to sunday

[Verse 2: Craig David]
Page two look at my girl
Come a little closer gimme a twirl
Put my hands on your body cause your on my mind
On my mind think about all the time
Girl can you give me what I wan't?
I don't know about you but I feel so hot
I wanna love you baby, do all the little things that I wanna do
Or we can do it in the pourin rain
Do it again do it again till you call my name
Girl you got me insane can't maintain the speed in the fast lane
Or we can do it on the telephone, fakin moans
Make you groan all night long yeah
Or we could do it on the down low, or when your all alone

Chorus:
Craig David (DJ Premier's scratch sample)
Cause it was ooooooh, on monday
And it was (...Two!) on tuesday
And it was ooooooohhh on wednesday
Gave her what she wanted through to sunday
Ooooooh, on monday
And it was (...Two!) on tuesday
And it was ooooooohhh on Wednesday
Gave her what she wanted through to sunday

[Verse 3: Mos Def]
Listen, little mamma you can kill all the drama
Girl you know you 'gone be here till tomorrow
Probably stay after that, later on and maybe play after that
Get it on and lay straight after that, it's like an natural fact
When you see me you know how to react
It don't matter anywhere that we at it's game time
Move your waistline shook your tail further to the bassline
Movin in the same time like we got the same time
Peep game, it's pro ball I'm pretty laced to my part
I go off like Biz Mark
Yeah I talk big talk but carry a big staff
And stay down for layin it down yo' big ass
I'm know I'm wrong, but damn ma I got to tell for true
Tell the world like I tell it to you
That's it's just a mere mention of you
You make me get in the mood
Mos and Craig Dav get in the mood it's like...

Chorus:
Craig David (DJ Premier's scratch sample)
Cause it was ooooooh, on monday
And it was (...Two!) on tuesday
And it was ooooooohhh on wednesday
Gave her what she wanted through to sunday
Ooooooh, on monday
And it was (...Two!) on tuesday
And it was ooooooohhh on Wednesday
Gave her what she wanted through to sunday
Ooooooh, on monday
And it was (...Two!) on tuesday
And it was ooooooohhh on wednesday
Gave her what she wanted through to sunday
Ooooooh, on monday
And it was (...Two!) on tuesday
And it was ooooooohhh on Wednesday
Gave her what she wanted through to sunday</pre>
