[Live Squad]
Guess who boom!
Niggas better wake up, raise your attention
Last time we forgot to mention
And if you hear the busting glocks and uzi's
The Squad did a motherfuckin gangsta movie
Yeah, I'm a gorilla, understand reality
Cooling in the street is a game to me
Live Squad coming hard boy, raised in the ghetto
Hello, I'm the rude fellow,
Check the melo-dy coming from the YG'z, see
Coming in the stores soon, check the movie!

[Hook](repeat 4 times)
Murder rate raises, wanna trade places?</pre>
