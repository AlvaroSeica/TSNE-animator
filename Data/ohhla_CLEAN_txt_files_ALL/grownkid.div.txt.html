[Verse 1: Like]
Listen, she say I'm gone a lot she cry
I'm never home she thinks I'm out cheatin
She swears I'm tryna to bone
she's losin trust in my she goin thru my phone
she makin fake pages I had to change my code
she ride by my house she sniffin dirty clothes
she be like "Like I know you be out with them thirsty hoes"
I'm like you buggin out I ain't concerned with those
I'm tryna get this bread I'm sick of workin lowers
she say I work her nerves
I make you nervous oh
Ok, that's cool I see you later gotta work some more
I'm on this paper chase it's nothin personal
but what you offer me is less than what I'm searchin for
she talk a lot of shit but it don't hurt no more
she gettin fat tryna blame it on the birth control
told her plain and simple this ain't gon' work no more
I got money on my mind you ain't worth my dough

[Chorus]
Money Money make the world go 'round
20, 40, 60, 80
Money, Money make the girls go wild
200, 300, 400, 5
Girl I wanna kick it but I'm tryna get paid, so I'm focused on one thing, my paper, paper.

[Verse 2: TiRon]
It's kinda funny how you said ain't no good
niggas left for the good sistas what's really good
with ya at the start you was prayin for a goodie good
but now you want a hood nigga, someone with good figures
he prolly could get you sprung of the soul clubs
and the clothes guzzlin the mo' you say you lookin for a dedicated love
you'll never date a scrub a church goin man who's a educated thug
it's like your brains all mixed up ya take all issed up
but then you claim that you independent no man providin ya cash
when we at the movies why we slide to the back
when it's time to pay what kinda games you tryna play
aim for the finer things fame and designer frames chains
and the diamond rings names I be tryna chase can't stop
apply the brakes maybe what I'm tryna say is...

[Chorus]

Baby baby baby I work...

[Verse 3: Like]
To get you out ya mommas house (and...)
To get your lazy ass of that couch
To get you to close your mouth
and to stop you from yellin at me (fo' real)
just the other day you threw melons at me
but when my check came you was hella happy (why?)
you see what I go thru and after all this I owe you?
girl I'm still wearing old shoes
hold up did you just order tofu?
that's the highest thing on the menu
let me guess want me to pay for your friend too (nope)
this is cuttin like a ginsu knife to my soul
oh you losin control just a year ago
you fell in love with the flow
now you just like the rap game in love with the dough

[Chorus]</pre>
