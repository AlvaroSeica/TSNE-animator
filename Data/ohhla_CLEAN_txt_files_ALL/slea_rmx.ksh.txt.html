[Ke$ha]
I don't need you or your brand new Benz, or your bougie friends
I don't need love lookin like diamonds, lookin like diamonds

Get sleazy

[Andre 3000]
We start out so cute in our baby pictures
That mama shot for our daddy so that he wouldn't forget ya
He forgot anyway, but hey one day he'll remember
If not, he's human, I'm human, you human
We'll forgive him
God gets him this ultimatum, can't see how mama hates him
He's such a cool ass guy, then wonder why she date him
I'm only eight, I'm not old enough, this is complicated
Two-parent dwelling-n-spelling has gotten so underrated
I only say this in cadence so it don't get negated
I was gone save it for later but later look like maybe
This crazy lady named Ke$ha is guessin my Mercedes
Would be all new and fru fru, but it's a 1980s
But now that we are cool cool, she's sippin Irish Baileys
She says, "Stacks you true blue", I say, "naw, I'm navy"
I call her Ke$ha, she like it because it's hood to her
She call me Andre 6000 because I'm good to her

[Chorus]
I don't need you or your brand new Benz, or your bougie friends
I don't need love lookin like diamonds, lookin like diamonds
I don't need you or your brand new Benz, or your bougie friends
I don't need love lookin like diamonds, lookin like diamonds

[Ke$ha]
You can't imagine the immensity of the {fuck} I'm not givin
about your money and manservant at the mansion you live in
And I don't wanna go places where all my ladies can't get in
Just rab a bottle, some boys, and let's take it back to my basement
and get sleazy, sick of all your lines, so cheesy
Sorry daddy, but I'm not that easy
I'm not gonna sit here while you circle jerk it and work it
I'a take it back to where my man and my girls is
Get sleazy {*4X*} Cause I'ma get
Get sleazy {*4X*} Cause I'ma get

[Chorus]

[Interlude: repeat 2X]
Rat-a-tat-tat on your dum-dum drum
The beat's so fat gonna make me cum/come
um, um, um, um, over to your place
Ah-ah-ah-AHH~!

[Ke$ha]
I don't mean to critique on your seduction technique
But-but your money's not impressin me, it's kinda weak
that-tha you really think you're gonna get my rocks off
Get my top and socks off, by showin me the dollars in your drop box
Me and all my friends, we don't buy bottles, we bring 'em
We take the drinks from the tables when you get up and leave 'em
And I don't care if you stare and you call us scummy
Cause we ain't after your affection and sure as hell not your money honey

[Chorus] + [Interlude]</pre>
