[Intro]
Let's talk about what happened here
If something did happen, maybe I can help

	You want to help me?

You look like a man that could use a friend

	*Sigh* There's no one else, kid it's me
	It's just, I'm alone, th-that's it ok, there you go

[Verse 1]
So the day begins with an overwhelming vibe that rides through my skin
Feeling dry but I take the high sights in
I'll get by with the right kind of swing
It's all good, the way it looks from within
You get shook, broke down, crook, busted wings
Cause everything seems to bleed, the need to give in
It's the simple things that might invite this shit in
And you ain't got to lock yourself away
You got a lot to offer, you know that mate?
I been there, scared to face the music
Feeling like shit cause all you do is do shit
And nothin seems to match up
And they seem too far away to ever catch up
Bad luck comes in abundance
Hung-over, performing for the hundreds
Picks me up from the carcass fungus spreadable
And these mates the unforgettable
Barely edible moments
Feeling totally lost, a way to find focus
The important thing in life is to know this
A better man, still kinda hopeless

{*Scratches*}
"Life shouldn't be so rough"
