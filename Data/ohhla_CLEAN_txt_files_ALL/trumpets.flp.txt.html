[MC Piper]
Countin' trumpets on the wall firey flame will kill us all
And I hear trumpets ringing in my head before I go to sleep
Takes me back way back when we were young and we were friends
Now I'm home alone smokin' cigarettes waitin' by the phone
Sweet Virgina blue skies early mornin' sunrise
I can see your spirit dancin' next to mine

[Chorus] (MC Piper)
I know that you'll never be the same again
We can just roll on down this road my friend
I know that you'll never be just never be alone
I know that you'll be there when I will say goodbye

[Steve Knight]
Hold on tight baby lean when I lean
Both arms tight lady follow my lead
Let your hair down feel it blow in the breeze
I'm a' take you to a place that you'll never believe
Riding on the wind disappear in the sky
Never ask why spread wings and fly
Sunbathe in the sunrays and dream
Listening to Dave play and Stevie sing

[Chorus]

[MC Piper]
Countin' trumpets on the wall firey flame will kill us all
And I hear trumpets ringing in my head before I go to sleep
Takes me back way back when we were young and we were friends
Now I'm home alone smokin' cigarettes waitin' by the phone
Sweet Virgina blue skies early mornin' sunrise
I can see your spirit dancin' next to mine
