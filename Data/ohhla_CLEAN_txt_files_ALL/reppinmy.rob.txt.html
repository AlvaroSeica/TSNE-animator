[Rob G]
(Verse 1)
You know
The block repre-sentin'
Fin' to go and deliver
Cause my block
Fin' and
Enter
They number one contenders
Since the glock detri-mental
Like liquor to your liver
Hatin' on your agenda, remember, I be the winner
But real, what it gotta be, accept me or you're knockin' me
My city gon' follow me, MY HOOD IS SO PROUD OF ME
You never seen my mug mean (Ha ha)
I got that "I'm-the-shit"
Swagger like the H, straight, runnin' through my blood stream
Now I'm in the club, gettin' thirsty in a player way (YEAH)
Liquor like my Gatorade, I do this on a day to day (YEAH, AY!)
She lookin' good, I'm a holler, make her follow
Where I'm from, WE ONLY TURNIN' DOWN OUR COLLARS, throw a dollar
TO THE DJ
And when he play what I like
Throw the dub with my left, and the H ON MY RIGHT
It's Houston, south west S.W.A.T. to the TOP
You ain't know this by now, JUST WATCH and see him reppin' my block

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 2)
Say
Now put your hood up in the sky, go and live it up (LIVE IT UP)
Represent like you the shit and you don't give a fuck (GIVE A FUCK)
Get a swisha, a lot of liquor, now buy the bar (BUY THE BAR)
Say, "You don't know me, but in my hood, I'm a fuckin' star" (LET'S GO)
Tell the DJ to let it ride and then make it bang (BANG)
This the moment to show the pride in the place you claim (Yeah)
Now wave it
Yeah, wave it
Put your hood all up in they faces
IF YOU LIKE ME
You think your hood is the dopest
You want the whole world to notice, so take your pride and expose it
This your moment to show it, it's 'bout as GOOD AS IT GETS
Hands up
IF YOUR HOOD IS THE SHIT, IT'S LIKE THIS
I spit, gettin' gripped, fin' to travel the globe (Globe)
And won't forget where I'm from, no matter where I go (Go)
When I step in the spot, you know I'm reppin' the glock
It won't stop, til I dead in the spot, s'you know I'm reppin' my block

Repeat Chorus

Break: Rob G
Cause in the hood, I'm a rep
In the streets, I'm a rep
In the club, I'm a rep
My block (MY BLOCK!)
In every city, I'm a rep
Every state, I'm a rep
Everywhere, I'm a rep
My block (MY BLOCK!)
Now
REP! (Yeah)
REP! (Yeah)
REP
Where you from
REP! (Yeah)
REP! (Yeah)
REP
Where you stay
REP! (Yeah)
REP! (Yeah)
REP
Rep your block
Let 'em know you in here cause I'm reppin' my block
