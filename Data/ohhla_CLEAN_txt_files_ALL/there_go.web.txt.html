Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
Yeah, see I've been grinding for a long time man
But I'm here now, there goes the neighborhood I guess, huh
You see I'm here to save the day with this music
Grinding to the point I think I'm really gonna loose it
But I won't lose nothing,
They trying to step to me but shit you think you could do better with it homie
Then go and do something, ah
They trying to tell me I'm crazy, but shit I'm crazy good
Step into your city, they sayin' there goes the neighborhood
The sale signs go up as soon as I show up
They building bomb shelters cause they know I'm gonna blow up, ah
Bright future, they say I'm a ticking time bomb
Until I'm up on MTV, waving saying hi mom
Grab your video cameras and get your night calms
Making history from the second they flip the lights on
I made it off being business savy and street smart
Who needs a co sign, I let the beats talk
I don't need another rapper lending help
Telling listen to some dope cuz shit, I tell him that myself
I'm just playing what I'm dealt, shit it's been a long road
But I got a lot under my belt and I felt
At times it was a lost cause
But I always got back upon my paws dog
So I know I'm gonna make it in the long haul
Shit it's now or never homie, I cannot stall
So I'm gonna reach out for the stars and I pray for the best
And that's how it's gonna be until the day of my death, word

[Chorus]
Just play in, tune in to this music
Have no fear, I save the day with this music
My city on my back, and I'ma take it wherever I go
Wherever I go, wherever I go, wherever I go
Say hello to the new guy in town
There goes the neighborhood, it's what they say

[Verse 2]
This is 12 years in the making, far from immediate
But now it's time to sink my teeth in it,
I'm on my beastly shit, cause I'm sick as fuck
You don't believe me bitch, then go ahead and spit that semen on a petri dish
You need sterilizer just to give me dap
Unless you want your immune system attacked, real rap
I'm not doing no duggy, these fucking idiots should drop the swag and take notes
Cause they can learn something from me
This is all I do man murder instrumentals
With this fire off the top like sweet tooth in twisted metal
I'm spitting rebel with a cause, deadly with the bars
Underdog since day one, wasn't expecting your applause
I respect your damn opinion, if you don't like my music
But if you don't respect my hustle, then you ain't paying attention
I pay so many fucking dudes my wallet's empty
Ain't a person here stopping Webby, motherfucker

[Chorus]
Just play in, tune in to this music
Have no fear, I save the day with this music
My city on my back, and I'ma take it wherever I go
Wherever I go, wherever I go, wherever I go
Say hello to the new guy in town
There goes the neighborhood, it's what they say.

[Verse 3]
Fucking animal, Webby's the Serengeti type
They whipping Lambos, but I made it on a pedal bike
Not even Gatorade replenishes electrolytes
I burn, going nuts from the fucking second I get the mic
I'm the grittiest grimiest and the wittiest, yeah
Jack the ripper to the beats I'm getting busy with, yeah
And half these rapper idiots ain't even literate
I'm battle tested and ready, Webby a young Odysseus
Fire in my eyes and I hunger for success
I'm hunting for the title, while they hunting for a check, yeah
Wondering what is next, but I'm going in fists swinging
Till your ears ringing, they don't expect what this kids bringing
Though if you didn't notice, so homie just don't provoke it
I got my state on my shoulders, till I'm getting scoliosis
Never gonna stop, my life is like the script of vertical limit
Motherfucker I'm getting to the top

[Chorus]
Just play in, tune in to this music
Have no fear, I save the day with this music
My city on my back, and I'ma take it wherever I go
Wherever I go, wherever I go, wherever I go
Say hello to the new guy in town
There goes the neighborhood, it's what they say</pre>
