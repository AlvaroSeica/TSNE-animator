[Jay Electronica]
I'm out that third ward where they bussin heads
Movin shakin hustlin scrambling buckin and duckin feds
The corner stay hot as sonars with blood rushing (russian) red
Down in the dirty we bout it and we ain't fuckin scared
I got em shook from the jump cause I'm a solider these niggas is yellow
I told you I'm out that magnolia mah nigga fo reala
On the grind all the time woaday stackin that scrilla
It's the south man we put the fuckin G in guerilla
Talk slick and get chyo neck slit quick
Cause uptown niggas don't play that shit
And if you ready come get me
Got a squad that's with me
To blow the beef outta control like ja and fifty
I'm the king the daddy ya heard the best around
Linked up with lil flip man we tear this bitch down
You know when them south boys is comin around
Cause all you gon' hear is lay it down lay it down

Walk walk with it [x4]
Rock rock with it [x4]
Shake shake with it [x4]
Pop pop with it [x4]

[Lil' Flip]
A lot of rap cats rap about jewels
But that ain't rose gold that's fools
Look at the shoes on the whip twenty-twos
I still got a deal what about you
I got liquor nigga you wanna drink?
I go on shopping sprees you want a mink?
I'm just kidding I ain't tricking for a hoe
This how I'm living I ain't hurting for no dough
I push tight whips just like percy
I always rock custom jerseys
My new shit about to drop on you niggas
Just call me hoe, when you not witcha nigga

[Jay Electronica]
Now heres a little story I got to tell
About a fresh young nigga ya know so well
It started way back, in history
In that third ward magnolia the U-P-T
I was born in seventy six and raised in the eighties
Pops left when I was six I was raised by ladies
Son of Marilyn brother of Fal
I grew up one block over from the cell [?]
T-I told me to be easy but I'm hungry as fuck
I want a house on the hill and some blow in the truck
Now I'm up in the club playa settin it off
With a mic in my palm tight lettin it off
Shorty, smilin she say I'm spec-tacular
She wanna bite on my neck like dracula
She said she wanna show me something good after the show
Whatever ma, but for now get yo ass on the floor</pre>
