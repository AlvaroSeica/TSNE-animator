Song:   Hate Runs Deep
Typed by: brians@compusmart.ab.ca

[Chorus]
Hate runs deep in the hearts of many
Hate runs deep in the guts of all
'Cause your hate can judge a fate
When guns blaze at nightime 'cause it's the right time for wrong
Hate runs deep in the hearts of many
Hate runs deep in the guts of all
'Cause your hate can judge a fate
'Cause niggas cuttin they lifelines for crime, but we still movin' on

[Saukrates]
Index fingers touch rewind as my aura proples your mindstate
Leaving behind fake visions
You're blind 'cause it's hard to find
Lyrics flood the black market more than rock can steal
My stock's hot, 'cause it's realer than real when caps peel
Pay rent for cement, mother's hearts gettin' bent
'Cause nights is trife
And it's chllin' like a villian executin' his killin' but there's no blood spillin'

And it's just as illin', prefer for head-fillin'
When you enter my jurasdicition of non-fiction
And lead-fillin' if you steppin' to mad niggas bitchin'
'Cause your gang is regretful when you're leadful
Bleedin' buckets of red from your head over duckets, fuck it
I'm living for next year, my dear
I say cheers and guzzle eleven beers to celebrate
The years of my life, I got mo' days than foes' days
Though some I hold days an optimistical state
For me, my grandmother will pray a tech spray my way
Losin' sleep over victims of the creep
The well runs dry as niggas wish to die
He said goodbye watchin' his honey cry
&gt;From the other side of Ryker's glass eye
Sauk guards no fraud
Elequent speach will teach, though my hate runs deep, nigga
Word up yo, my hate runs deep

[Marvel]
Aiyo, my hate runs deep like still waters
The thought of all frustrations, bring forth inovations
I flip my riddle, wreck a direct hit
With some egotistical mystical type of shit to make that head split
I bring complex sexual intercourse to microphones
Hittin' the slang with the anger from my childhood
Runnin' around with dirty stains in dirty Haines
Peepin' flirty dames, shit never stay the same
I used to write 'cause it was appropriate
But now I feel like I gotta write for industries and associates
Some years back I found a pillow to scream into
I was fiendin' through crates of legendary greates
And seein' through the wack individuals who left residuals of bullshit lying
around
Fuckin' with niggas like me, 'cause now they're tryin' to be down 
With my session, corrupt like projects in the recession
Consider it a blessing when Marvel hit the stage
Go home and write a page 'cause it's my daily routine
Vibrations are caught and then I see the unseen
When I creep, you know my shit is deep, word up

[Chorus]

[Saukrates]
Niggas gettin' stuck in the alleyways of schemes for bucks
Stuck in that and short cuts
But I chose to fight those urges that were foul
And write prose inspite of foes lurking the prowl
So I live to see my child smile
To increase my chance, fertilize my side of the family branch
As my flows enhance the relationship of romance
Women get stuck in the trance, brothers dig my style as I intoxicate
Their minds with consisce rhymes and give 'em the whole nine
My shit's natural, I'm prime
Generating inspirational thoughts
Bitches still get caught in the crossfire I duck
So the streets don't talk
No concern for the rebel as an average nigga got dissed
Pulled the trigger and missed
Now a casuality lies on the streets leakin'
Attitudes peakin', the levels settle when I'm speakin
Momma's hands was reachin'
Thought there was black on the backs of many
The day they buried the child who died for the worth of a penny
This topic strikes me
MC Saukrates says shit unlikely
To cease, black please come back, fittin' sterotypes exact
Chemicals react when I rap
As a youth I never thought life could be so tough
Givin' half a deck, you never realise that you're bluff earnin' half a check

The moonshine craters and drug deal parade 
Receiving another wage, gettin' paid to get yourself a fade
Don't let cash burn fast no more
According to the world you're poor

[Chorus]</pre>
