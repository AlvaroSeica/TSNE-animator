"Huh, yo, check it out
Al Nuke be the Don
What's crackin' on this track
My nigga Drunken Master, baby

You-know-what-I'm-sayin'?"

[Lady's voice (Al Nuke)
	Al Nuke]
I can tell you all the reasons
why they playa hate
	You wanna hate, we got the BEAM on 'em
Playa hate- Playa hate
	These million dollar niggas boot 'em wit' a TEAM on 'em- BIATCH!
I can tell you all the reasons ("That goes to all you busta, bitch-boy,
why they playa hate		 mark-ass niggas")
	You wanna hate, we got the BEAM on 'em
Playa hate- Playa hate
	These million dollar niggas boot 'em wit' a TEAM on 'em- BIATCH!
I can tell you all the reasons
why they playa hate
Playa hate- Playa hate
I can tell you all the reasons
why they playa hate
Playa hate- Playa hate

[Al Nuke]
"You know what I'ma do?
You know what I'ma do?
I'm kick a freestyle, check it out."

You wanna hate me 'cause I'm do-able- Five-ten suitable
Bitches be sayin' Tiq was sayin' 'Damn, Al beautiful'
Loc'ed from the crazy drama, stroked all them bitches' mommas
Put up a six and catch a cab, roll is still solid
You wanna beat her 'cause she lovin' me
Candle light and bubbley- She say she likin' you but say she fuckin' me
Playa, you got a plan Baby, don't think
Off the six and the cris, he got the B-12 stankin'
Let's do the ocean and the hundred footers, just me and the homies
and some skimmies floatin' out to Bermuda- It's ALL real, niggas
We ball, my figgas, rules apply
Respect, it's the real kind of niggas, live or die
See, compare you and I is like a bee to a fly
You almost there but in my eyes, nigga, who cares?
It's kinda weird for a playa to be laughed at, half-scratched,
cold on him- Don't be tryin', still had a hoe's on him
What?

why they playa hate
		Why you out there playa hatin' on me?
Playa hate- Playa hate
		Why you out there playa hatin' on me?

[Al Nuke]
Is it because I'm hot now, shows we rock down?
Al Nuke and Mister Moon got this bitch locked down
so from island, haters' snitchin' on 'em
The federalists but we STILL got a team on 'em
We put the Beam on you haters when you suckers stroll
Niggas all up in mine but still wonder why you bitches' broke
Put 'em in your face, you choke
All niggas talk about me- 'Al nuke done blew up,
now these niggas gotta rap about me' You bustas shoot up
Bitch Boy, all I do is laugh- You wanna kill me
but your bitch want my autograph! It's just that thug in you
Now tell yo' baby's moms we love them too
Best friends, sisters and cousins, boo FUCKED them too
See that's the work we do, now playa part done stuck on this thang
And who the type of niggas that rap, 
next day, wanna say we done fucked off
in the game- You know what I'm talkin' about
Half you niggas, lame money- Got the same money
What you talkin' about spendin' with me, nigga? We live for champagne money!
