[Intro: Prodigal Sunn]
Yo, yo, yo I tell you, hold that down son
(Freeze) do the knowledge, man
Yo, shorty, yo shorty, hold up
(Let me see your ID) Watch out for cops
(Let me see your ID) It's hot over here, man
(I ain't got none) Yo

[Chorus: Prodigal Sunn]
We got bangers that gon' feel this, the grindz
We got hitters that gon' love this, the grindz
I'm in the hood, nigga, all the time, the grindz
Get yours, cuz I'mma get mine, the grindz

[Prodigal Sunn]
Criminal life, hard times, stressed and strifed
On voodoo grounds, kept the four pound, jew-els and crowns
It's elementary, lesson learned, the penetentiary
Half black, Indian, ready, for any, that can raise a semi
Surrounded by tech's, criminal sets
Young vet who learned respect, never turned for the check
Chin check threats, keep 'em pecked, fleein' for breath
Muscle humble in the jungle, and catchin' trouble with death
Dogs and cats, monkey wrenches, gats and rats
Code of the street, carry heat, how we defeat
Every day, I walk through the valley of corruption, deceit
Silent on my feet, do it for my son and my team
Seein' straight through the American dream
Picture perfect, though it may seem
Illustrious, diamond and gleams
Got these fools in the time to seen, many dying for CREAM
Survived to get by, love for the skin

[Chorus]

[Freemurder]
Check this funky, crush up, til I'm extra high
See a bitch, I push up, like the exercise
See me? Gettin' mushed up, gettin' next to mine
Think you gettin' some of that good stuff, nigga, nevermind
I get head and dive, right in the coupe
While you kissin' her from neck to thigh, write in your coupe
Get the tech and grind, tonight and get that loot
I hope your money's stretched for time, tonight, with the troop
Feel the thunder from the pound, when you niggaz pump next to Free
Til I put you underground like SMD's
Testin' me, if you think you get the best of me
Don't know I break niggaz up like referee's
Best to squeeze, see that Vietnam vet in me
Drop everything, like peace, I want extra cheese
Gotta respect Free, know, that gun hold six
If you say Free, better be, from 106
Ever since day one I've been ringin' bells
I'm all Avon, you like Stringerbell
Niggaz wearin' wires, beat a nigga ass down
Til his ass down, til his mouth wired, it'll be up

[Chorus]

[ShaCronz]
Ya'll already know what this is holmes, you can get your shit blown
Leave dudes paralyzed from their neck to their hipbone
And I'mma stay in beef, that's why I grip chrome
You wouldn't understand pain and grief, until it hit home
A street scholar, when I teach, the weak follow
Ready to creep on my beef, I let that heat holla
And I'mma gangsta like T. Roger
Ya'll wanna conversate the street dollars, listen
Come on, I roll for dolo and my crew hang tough
Ain't no, duckin' or runnin' when the two things up
Bitches saw us in the Port, they like, you game up
Through some pebbles in the watch, and I stepped my Zu game up
After dunking, never scared to fire
Your main bitch be givin' me top
And on my head longer than a hair dryer
Feel the wrath of God, I shall awaken the dead
Be in a cold sweat shakin', achin' in bed

[Chorus]</pre>
