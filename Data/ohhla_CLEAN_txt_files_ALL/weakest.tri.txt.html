Ayyy it's your boy Don P right ?right TRILLVILLE (corlio)
I need all my niggaz to look around (look around)
You see some hoes in the atmosphere? (I see them)
You know what they is? (we don't give a Fuck today nigga)
They the weakest link ayy ayyy (tell them niggaz goodbye)

[Chorus]
As far as I can see you're a bitch to me
As far as I can see you're a bitch to me
You're the weakest link (goodbye)
You're the weakest link (goodbye)
You're the weakest link (goodbye)
You're the weakest link (goodbye)
As far as I can see you're a bitch to me
As far as I can see you're a bitch to me
You're the weakest link (goodbye)
You're the weakest link (goodbye)
You're the weakest link (goodbye)
You're the weakest link (goodbye)

[Verse One: Don Pheazy]
Ayy Yeaa
They always asking why I say yeaaaa
Cuz I mean what I say
That how I agree with myself
And I'm a keep it real
And you should keep believing
Cuz if you don't your the weakest link and you should be leaving
Crunk as fuck and anit no name
To the name that I'm scheming
Like Michele Vic I'm talking shit anit playing Â…
So I don't need a reason
to knock you out the projects
Just take your fucking wallet
And make it a fucking project
And your hoes can't stop it
Like all around that open ass
I'm ready to shoot
When nigga all you do is fucking pass
It's the last day of class
So anit no need to ask
Cuz I anit your teacher
I wont let you pass
I'm Don A..K.A
Slash Corlio
Who started this whole shit
And put chall all on
And the pro's they don't know
And the girls ready to fuck
And the only thing left
is get rid of you fucking chumps (HEY)

[Chorus]

[Verse two: Dirty Mouth]
Perpetrating niggaz always like to talk that bullshit
Ima let you feel it when the bullets start to talk shit
Right out the barrel of my rugers at you lame hoes
This is how it goes with my bitches matters with a hoe
Right through your dome cuz my chrome is my only friend
Nigga don't pretend to be down when you wasn't in
Smiling in my face ima stab you in the fuckin back
Dressed in all black with the Tec ready to attack
Nigga you anit hard ima take your ass up off the map
Peeling niggaz caps talking shit running at they traps
I'm the realest nigga that you hoes Eva seen before
Ima let cha know I anit neva been a scary hoe
I'm not your average Joe that you seen on your fucking block
Nigga pop pop as I clock back the fucking glock
Niggaz need to stop talking down up on my gang
Ima go insane on they ass as I'm busting brain(brain)

[Chorus]

[Verse three: Lil La]
As far as I can see you the bitch
You the weakest link out cha mother fucking click
Nigga step up if you down for getting hit
Or quit talking all that monkey ass shit
I'm cutting out the mizzle
You getting paid a lizzle
This sum real shit
This anit no nursery rhyme rizzle
Ima let it get you
Right where it hit you
They gun have to stitch you
Real niggaz don't ride with you
That's why a nigga grillz you
I see the bigger picture
But don't nobody miss you
Your bitch can't even kiss you
So she about to dis you
Or better yet quit you
Ima real nigga
if she ask I got a dick
So pass me the swizzle
I'm gone out tha lizze
As far as I can see
You a bitch ass nigga
Its time to fire it up
Your time expired up
And when I pull it out
You get shot up my nigga</pre>
