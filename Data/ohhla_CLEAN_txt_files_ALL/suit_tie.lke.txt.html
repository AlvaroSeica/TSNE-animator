[Intro: Justin Timberlake]
Ohhhh
I be on my suit and tie shit, tied shit, tied
I be on my suit and tie shit, tied shit
Can I show you a few things?
A few things, a few things, little baby cause
I be on my suit and tie shit, tied shit (check it)
I be on my suit and tie shit, tied shit
Let me show you a few things
Let me show you a few things
(Wait a minute, you ready J.T.?)

[Justin Timberlake]
I can't wait 'til I get you on the floor, good-lookin
Hey, goin hot so hot just like an oven
And owww, I burned myself, I just had to touch it
But it's so fire, and it's all mine
Hey baby, and we don't mind all the watchin - hi
Cause if they study close real close they might learn somethin
She ain't nothin but a little doozy when she does it
She's so fire, tonight

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
And as long as I've got my suit and tie
I'ma leave it all on the floor tonight
And you got fixed up to the nines
Let me show you a few things (show you a few things)
All pressed up in black and white
And you're dressed in that dress I like
Love is swingin in the air tonight
Let me show you a few things (show you a few things)
Let me show you a few things
Show you a few things about love
Now we're in the swing of love
Let me show you a few things
Show you a few things about love, hey

[Justin Timberlake]
Stop, let me get a good look at it
Oooh so thick, now I know why they call it a fatty
And ohhh~! Shit's so sick got a hit and picked up a habit
Uh, but that's alright, cause you're all mine
Ohhh~! Go on and show 'em who you call daddy
I guess they're just mad cause girl they wish they had it
Oooh, my killer, my +Thriller+, yeah you're a classic
And you're all mine, tonight

[Chorus]

[J.T.] Get out your seat Hov'

[Jay-Z]
Uhh, all black at the white shows
White shoes at the black shows
Green card for the Cuban links
Y'all sit back and enjoy the light show
Nothin exceeds like excess
Stoute got gout from havin the best of the best
Is this what it's all about? I'm at the rest-
-aurant, my rant disturbin the guests
Years of distress, tears on the dress
Try to hide her face with some make-up sex
Uhh... this is truffle season
Tom Ford tuxedos for no reason
All Saints for my angel
... Alexander Wang too
Ass-tight denim and some Dunks
I'll show you how to do this Young! Uhh
No papers, catch vapors
Get high, out Vegas
D'uss√©s on doubles, ain't lookin for trouble
You just got good jeans/genes so a nigga tryin to cuff you
Tell your mother that I love her cause I love you
Tell your father we go farther as a couple
They ain't lose a daughter, got a son
I'll show you how to do this huh! Uhh

[Chorus] w/ minor variations

[J.T.] Ohhh~!
