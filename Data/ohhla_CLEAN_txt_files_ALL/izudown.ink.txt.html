Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Pre-Chorus]
I can tell by the way you've been
lookin at yo girlfriend
I can tell by the way you've been
dancing wit yo girlfriend

[Chorus]
Can I ask?
Iz u down? Iz u down?
Iz u down? Iz u down?
Can I ask?
Iz u down? Iz u down?
Iz u down? Iz u down?

[Verse]
Now it ain't hard to tell
By the way you've been lookin at her face
It's something on yo expression
lookin like you need a taste of that Ace
Take the ground, it's nothing that I can say
It's a lot up on her plate, I've been ready, hit the bass
Hit it
Guess who back in the building
with the motherfuckin problems
Top of the world, all the way from the bottom
Turn this whole bitch up like fox and go in, show out
I seen them kids send pics of you and yo girlfriend
Tryna get yo lights up
But this shit been helping
Got a question, how many drinks
do it take til you start getting touchy feely?
Gotta make sure I pay them both
attention or one of em gon kill me
Say the truth, whole truth, no
undercover freak, I'm guilty
Check please, pay the cost
To be the boss, just bill me

[Pre-Chorus]
I can tell by the way you've been
lookin at yo girlfriend
I can tell by the way you've been
dancing wit yo girlfriend

[Chorus]
Can I ask?
Iz u down? Iz u down?
(One question)
Iz u down? Iz u down?
Can I ask?
Iz u down? Iz u down?
(One question)
Iz u down? Iz u down?

[Verse]
Can I have that? You and yo best
friend on a mattress
Ass so fat, need a lap dance
That was way back then
Lost a little weight but that ass still thick, goddamn
So innocent, I'm a guilty trip, she ride the dick
It be worth the trip
No answers, no romantic shit
Just friends with benefits
I take that (take that)
Never seen a roof come back on a
Maybach (I don't think you seen that)
Uh tryna meet there, I could put you anywhere
Fly private air, uh yea
Who do dare?
Take it on me, can't compare, my fashion rare
All I wear, mad skin skill, man that shit so ill
I just wanna take you girls home
Make a nasty song and put this shit online
We could do it like dinner plate
Have a house party, all night long
Iz u down is my theme song
Take yo thong off, put me on
T-Raw, I'm in the dub so go and let a nigga bump

[Bridge]
âCus I can tell by the way, tell tell by the way
I can tell by the, I can tell tell by the by the
âCus I can tell by the way, tell tell by the way
I can tell by the, I can tell tell by the way
I can tell by the way you've been lookin at yo girlfriend
I can tell by the way you've been dancing wit yo girlfriend

[Verse]
I can tell from how you look inside of her eye
It's obvious this time you havin the time of your life
The timin is right, this kind of a night need two at a time
Round two, upright, I find these hoes just losin their mind
Girls gone wild, going all out
Let's be honest, you ain't gotta lie
One question, how many freaks do it take til this bitch turn into a orgy
3 shots in and I'm feelin like Horry
Shoulda never gave a nigga money, man pour me
Just pour me up, high, I'm sippin lean like I'm on a fuckin diet
LA nigga, bout to start a fuckin riot
Why you tryna deny it?

[Pre-Chorus]
I can tell by the way you've been
lookin at yo girlfriend
I can tell by the way you've been
dancing wit yo girlfriend

[Chorus]
Can I ask?
Iz u down? Iz u down?
(One question)
Iz u down? Iz u down?
Can I ask?
Iz u down? Iz u down?
(One question)
Iz u down? Iz u down?</pre>
