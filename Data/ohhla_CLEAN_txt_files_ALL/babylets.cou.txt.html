[Chorus: Silk-E]
Baby let's have a baby, before.. Bush do somethin crazy {*2X*}
I don't want the world to blow
before we get a chance to let our love grow
I don't want the world to blow
before we get a chance to let our love grow

[Silk-E]
I don't really wanna fuss and fight
Baby we might have numbered nights
We might never get our money right
We could take off this patch tonight
Bombs goin off everywhere
The police got us runnin scared
But I still got some love to share
Plus you know I stopped smokin squares

[Chorus]

[Silk-E: repeat previous verse]
