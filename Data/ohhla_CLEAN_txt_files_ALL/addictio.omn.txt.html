you know you got me ___open_______ I can't help but get this feeling
you make me feel so high it blows my mind, let's make it last
and when I'm left alone, I toss and turn I need your healing
when where together, oh, it's so much better
let's make it last

I understand the way you feel, you've never been touched by something so real
I gave it to you once, I'm never going there again
cause' you're getting too addicted, my love is heroine
I'm not the one you want to get involved with, we're not meant to be
that's where we conflict
you knew about me from the start, you heard about my history with other people's hearts
I play with their emotions and I scramble with your thoughts
I know how to make crave and spend days in the dark
I came into your life and corrupted your innocence
let your family and friends be your witnesses
lets end this on a good note or show um' what your weakness is
forget about me, learn to live with out me
never speak of this
when you gonna learn there aint no future in this left
I tell you all the time but you know you never listen just

you know you got me open I can't help but get this feeling
you make me feel so high it blows my mind, let's make it last
and when I'm left alone, I toss and turn I need you here
when where together, oh, it's so much better
let's make it last

I wrote this for you on a road trip for you
I only slid through _for a few to make do
I'm trying to make something out of nothing make sense
but certain situation fuckin' with my patience
got me staring at this picture on my wall
its been about a week since I last heard you call
so how you been, and the where you been, how are you
I think about it for a minute then I walk it off
I know I keep a look like nothings bothering me at all
but the time I spent with you, a part of me dissolved
can't nobody take me where you took me
I don't regret it though, we had to let it go
and in the end I'm happy that you shook me

you know you got me open I can't help but get this feeling
you make me feel so high it blows my mind, let's make it last
and when I'm left alone, I toss and turn I need you here
when where together, oh, it's so much better
LET'S MAKE IT LAST</pre>
