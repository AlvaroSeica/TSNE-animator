Chorus 1: repeat 2x

Let me see ya swang ya soldier raggs
Let me see ya swang ya soldier raggs (swang em swang em)

Chorus 2: repeat 2x

Ya'll people ya'll better get ready for war
You see it's war time, boy is you a soldier

Verse 1: Beelow

See I'ma soldier so I gotta put my raggs up high
Six gloves across my grill representing that south side
You got drama, fool you best of bring yo best
Cause I'm quick to put this red dot on yo chest
We got choppers by the pound
To lay them fools down
And a click of raw soldiers in the club ready to clown
With them bee bopping girls that a set you up
With that bomb killer issue that a mess you up
I'm bout my paper, I got's to get it, I got's to have it
It's all about them raggs, leave the tricks for silly rabbits
Ain't no slippin in my camp I keeps my nine strapped daily
I'm ready to go to war like my group Three Deadly

Verse 2: Ms. Peaches

We got them rags, we got them choppers, you can't stop us
Do it show, getting paid by the nopoly
We got 'em swanging in the club
Talking bout them raggs
This gangsta coming atcha ackin bad ackin bad
Paralyze the style, with these lyrics that I spit
I'm jumping out like a gymnastic
Gangsta's, we coming drastic
I be ripping 'em up, tearing 'em down, burning us up
Wrap 'em up like Christmas turkey
And chew 'em like hubble bubble
So why ya figure you wanna go to war,
with these soldiers down south,
We be quick to draw
Mean muggin' straight thuggin' in them clubs slangin' them bags
If you real, wanna be down, put 'em up and swang dem raggs

Chorus 1: repeat 2x

Let me see ya swang ya soldier raggs
Let me see ya swang ya soldier raggs (swang em swang em)
Chorus 2: repeat 2x

Ya'll people ya'll better get ready for war
You see it's war time, boy is you a soldier


Verse 3: Thug Addict

Told these people we soldiers, people been easy
People been taking me lightly
See I'm ready for war, ready to do whatever they like
Come through the thing here booming
Like partner what the hell you won't do
Let me tell you a little thing or two
I'm from that Baton Rouge
I chill with Beelow and the gang
Busting heads and breaking ankles
Roll like planes coming out the hangers
Calico ranger, busting rounds, lip singer
Throw on my soldier rag, cause a lil g out chere ackin bad
I'm that b in the boot, ain't no telling what I'm liable to do
I just might get that out you and yo whole damn crew
I'm that T to the H to U-G-A double D-I-C-T
Down with B-A double L-I-N-M-U-S-I-C
Just throw ya rags on
Keep ya hands on ya chrome
Just get 'em gone and I bet they leave ya alone
Boy it's on, say frown
Throw ya soldier raggs round, pour it down
I found out that 
really these people don't know nothing bout that dirty south
Or how we boot and turn it out
Lay it down like dominos
These here for all the broads
In this shit like g-string draws
Outlaws ready for war

Chorus 1: repeat 2x

A let me see ya swang ya soldier raggs
Let me see ya swang ya soldier raggs (swang em swang em)

Chorus 2: repeat 2x

Ya'll people ya'll better get ready for war
You see it's war time, boy is you a soldier

Verse 4: Beelow

You gotta keep ya eyes peeled enemies in sight
I keep my boots strapped daily soldier ragg tied tight
So when that beef start-dropping, watch 'em fall in line
I gotta click of raw soldiers ready to slang that iron
We blinding and blasting acting donkey on that ass
And them suckers in the club on the floor ackin bad
I got 'em hopping like rabbits
Couchie popping like automatic
And if you down with some static Ballin a sure like to add it
We gotta kick it for this beat, like a cluck on the street
Cause I give it what he want, cause I practice what I preach
Don't let 'em get ya, them soldiers get ya,
Don't let 'em get ya, don't let 'em get ya, them soldiers get ya,
Them thugs split ya

Chorus 1: repeat 2x

Let me see ya swang ya soldier raggs
Let me see ya swang ya soldier raggs (swang em swang em)

Chorus 2: repeat until fade

Ya'll people ya'll better get ready for war
You see it's war time, boy if you a soldier</pre>
