[Chorus]
Killer with, killer with, killer with
That lingua
Killer with, killer with, killer with
That culture
Killer with, killer with, killer with
That lingua
Killer with, killer with, killer with
That culture
Killer with that lingua, killer with that culture
Killer with that lingua, killer with that culture
Killer with that lingua, killer with that culture
Killer with that lingua, killer with that culture

[Verse 1]
Snow flown with Fred, like you under that L
My tracks was trained to go over your head
I don't see style, show me the bread
Most these rappers is so, so, so
So I'll just go in instead
I told Vado watch, I turn the icegrill to a clear face
Like a Mavado watch
Your girl suck me off, I don't know her name
I know her head was solid gold like Notre Dame
I can break a brick on Saint Nicholas into new shit
I'm cold as the sniffles, like syphilis you'll be sick of it
Tb and quick as yous, you niggas I be spitting with
Siph is what we hittin with
On the strip we're getting it
I heard your verses, y'all word ain't original
You niggas suck like word is original
With your candy bars, I'm the boarder day
And the man to mar, das

[Chorus]
Killer with, killer with, killer with
That lingua
Killer with, killer with, killer with
That culture
Killer with, killer with, killer with
That lingua
Killer with, killer with, killer with
That culture
Killer with that lingua, killer with that culture
Killer with that lingua, killer with that culture
Killer with that lingua, killer with that culture
Killer with that lingua, killer with that culture

[Verse 2]
Cam said he the best, mace told him he next
If Ben Gud was alive, he prolly say he the first
Jae Millz is his man so every day they connect
We're reppin the crew name and pull part he'll except
Backed out in that muzane, blacked out choose plane
Tapped out with my boo thang
Strap out, 2 chains
Said she wanna hear Wale, I do it all, shit I don't hate
I told her home by a mile away
She threw the dome like why wait
I let her play with my nuts though
Socks high, my chucks low
My team hot, it's just us though
Y'all left the roof not so
Tell the shoot, he must go
He ain't bullet proof, he ain't tough you
I'm in the coupe, I got a tough hoe
If I wear suits, with the strucks though
Wassup hoe, young fly and getting it
She on me, you on her
Man you want beef cause I'm hittin it
87 I'm whippin it, you drivin in stop fibble then
Then see a rollie, not citizen
4th quarter Bobe, I'm finishin

[Chorus]
Killer with, killer with, killer with
That lingua
Killer with, killer with, killer with
That culture
Killer with, killer with, killer with
That lingua
Killer with, killer with, killer with
That culture
Killer with that lingua, killer with that culture
Killer with that lingua, killer with that culture
Killer with that lingua, killer with that culture
Killer with that lingua, killer with that culture

[Verse 3]
Killer with the bars, killer with the 5th
Your girl in thirst mode, I'm a kill her with this dick
It's mister most hated, how can I help it
I get you washed up, like I work at a shelter
I'm at the weekend for allstars and all stars
While I'm seein p in the sky, we all stars
You tryina catch a fade, we letting that torture off
My camp concentrated, no holocaust
You call that woman your wife, shit what we call her toss
You call that nigga big homie, my younglings call him soft
These hoes know we make movies like Tarantino
That's why I fucked everything, from Riverside to Paladino
Young P we curtlin, smooth as jargons
No lie, mills been fly since Adrian birth them
I'm the type to smoke a kush fill bummer
And fuck your whole show up, shout out to lil mama

[Chorus]
Killer with, killer with, killer with
That lingua
Killer with, killer with, killer with
That culture
Killer with, killer with, killer with
That lingua
Killer with, killer with, killer with
That culture
Killer with that lingua, killer with that culture
Killer with that lingua, killer with that culture
Killer with that lingua, killer with that culture
Killer with that lingua, killer with that culture</pre>
