Typed by: luny@home.com

[E-40]
Tennessee tighty, I went out my body
Had a little too much to drink Almighty
God can you show me some leeway
I'm seein twos on the mutha fuckin fr, a freeway

[B-Legit]
I comin out the gate crooked and I'm loosey
Got the tech and my deck and some mob music
Hit the strip tryin to catch me a twenty doosey
Drinkin bombay mixin it with orange juice

[E-40]
Twas the night before my rad had to turn himself in
One or less more violation and he's lookin at ten
So we gon live it up and act bad balls
And party til the mutha fuckin wheels fall off

[B-Legit]
Hope those wheels ain't made of stone
Five in the mornin and I still ain't home
Man I'm tore like never before
On the couch assed out with my eyes on low

[E-40]
Tonight we gon smoke..
burrito size Taylors served with Vegas
Like to drink beer with mashed potatoes

Steak and chicken, eggs and grits
Clicked out shit makes platinum hits

[Chorus]
[E-40]
I don't really know why niggas made me go way out
my body, way out, my body..
I don't really care if the popoes stop and stare
I'm way out, my body, way out, my body

[E-40]
A'ight B
I heard the yak went quack, zob schilacked
Multi-orgasms and the bitch collapsed

[B-Legit]
From the back I bash all night I last
When I grab that ass long dick ya daz

[E-40]
A ruh uh ruh uh ran up on her, from Tacoma
Man that bitch had miles on her

[B-Legit]
Fuckin wit a pimp bitch you ain't heard
You can start me in the mornin with a bottle of 'birds
Lick on the hip and watch the dickhead rise
Up under your legs, in between your thighs

[E-40]
Long range pimpin, LRPs
No high jeans no ticks and fleas

[B-Legit]
Wake me in the mornin cause at night I snores
Alcohol comin all out my pores
Four-door drivin and I'm fast asleep
Bitch next to me in the passenger seat

[Chorus]

[E-40]
Certified top hat, one of the truest
Timin like my niggas up in east St. Louis

[B-Legit]
Jack be Daniels, Jack be swift
My niggas in the H-Town smoke the spliffs

[E-40]
Juice and Vodka, the tower of power
A plate of hot wings and some whiskey sour

[B-Legit]
I don't stop perkin keeps in goin
A full house in my dank room blow air

[E-40]
Nigga disrespect don't let it slide
Go get your entourage fool time to ride

[B-Legit]
I spots red lights and I'm loose and lick
Open bottle and a gat in my glove compartment

[E-40]
Alcohol, tabacco and firearms
But this time man it's a false alarm
I really wish I took another route
But I'm gone out my body way out

[Chorus]</pre>
