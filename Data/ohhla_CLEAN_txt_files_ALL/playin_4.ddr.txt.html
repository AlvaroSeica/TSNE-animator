[Lil Knock]
Aiyo pa, ain't none of y'all bustin ya cronz
I knew that time niggas was fish, from what I'm seein so far
You know the rules, so the nigga got bruised, son took his jewels
I spit in his face, for fakin them moves
Feels like if I should take his face, end up between the gates
His peeps just evacuate, none of these faggot niggas hold weight
It was all because burners went off back and forth
Shit ain't horrible, shit is terrible like up north
I seen one sissy get dropped for no reason
I had this shit lock since last season
I be damned if I start bleedin
Let off the street sweep, we don't gotta go in deep
I'ma go in there, tear that shit up before the smoke clear

[Chorus 2X]
Niggas best to know our steez, my jewel be's like jewelry
Ice wit rubies, I can take it from you, you can't take it from me
We stay deep, playin for keeps, cuz we all gotta eat, yo

[D. Real]
So all my muthafuckin niggas raise ya stem in the air
And go click click, as if you just don't care
You got beef son, on the double I'll be there
Well prepared wit adeem, slugs to share
I roll wit the brokest niggas, but won't hesitate to toke they triggas
On ya four, you figgas is straight to stick ya
You can get mad, and you can get back, but if you do
Make sure ya strapped, cuz it ain't where you from
It's where you at, bet that, on ya life, check ya sites
In the 718 area code thugs stay hype, maybe rule nights
At times it ain't right, nigga but is it
When it come to the come down, nigga is you gon' deal wit it
Or get done away, or run away, or handle your B.I.
Like a man, and not a bitch and do it the real way
The steel way, and pull it, make your advisory eat the bullet
If it ain't D, my steel rep me to the fullest
And I roll wit the rudest, niggas don't want to test me
Cuz they know my piece, I shoot it
Since the days of turret, in the baronet like fluid
Penetrated through my music whenever I blow soul
Everybody, move ya body, or get hit wit the sawed-off shotty
I guarantee you won't make it out the lobby
Beatin ass and gettin tow up's a hobby
You can't see me, so nigga why try me
When I roll wit the emits legion of niggas beside me
D.K.S. straight backin down, what what, straight back you down

[El Sha]
Yo, I'm nasty like tea wit no sugar, ya niggas get pluck like boogers
I come last like December, the last month, I'm on my last blunt
Everything you want you can't get, until you fuck wit me and my click
The shit I kick, mix wit my niggas lyrics
Talkin about backin, now what's happenin, clappin at them
The way them niggas blow, they need to go double platinum
But nobody like the bad guys, or bad guides or the bad times
Ya niggas need to recognize, I advise you to act normal
I go around like a marble, or the planet, it's horrible
And ya niggas can't stand it, until you left stranded
And then vanish, understand it, capsize
I release hoes that can't be sold
Your goal like gold, that's been stoled, I was told
When your goal farther hold, never hesitate to blow
Let them niggas know it's no joke, when your gun smoke
It won't be funny, when you left a hole in they tummy
Wrapped up like a mummy, my whole fam is out for the money
Take a nigga from a society, take his soul from his body
And if it ain't fear, I want your stupid ass to come here
To even come near, you feel like you stuck in a square
Or muthafuckin box, with me, D. Real and Lil Knock
And Mean Gene, call him Gino, corner dice games, 
the hemmer's like casino

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
