[Bridge]
She's a beast in the morning, freak in the night
Make her sleep in the morning, freak in the night
She's a beast in the morning, freak in the night
I like it, I like it like this

[Verse 1]
I wanna love you forever, that's why we're still together
But you be trippin so much? You make it tougher than leather
See one minute you love it then the next one you hate it
You like to argue with a nigga, I'll be participatin
See you sweet as a donut, then you flip me, you go nuts
I was trippin with somebody, if you dumb that's a bonus
You keep a bitch for her evil, you can't be yelling at people
Sometimes I think I should move in, I should just go on and just leave it
Don't try to tell me nothing, you need to be fussin to cancel me out
Don't understand what all the fussin about
Open the door, get the W out
But you were tender fore you get to speak of that you got a foot in yo mouth
I don't understand if you was putting out
Will I be losing? I think it's roodery they got something
We get to damn near dookle it out
With everything I love
But that's the kind of love I can barely do without
Cause um...

[Chorus]
You love is like schizophrenia
And I be like a-ya-ya-ya
Don't know what done got into you
Maybe I try ya-ya-ya
You love is like schizophrenia
And I be like a-ya-ya-ya
I'll be your strait jacket, hold you tight
I really think you'll be alright now

You make me mad, you make me
You make (like like) crazy
You make me mad, you make me
Make me zone (this shit down)

And since you do it I be talkin about
Delivery... love you
And since you do it I be talkin about
Delivery... love you

[Verse 2]
Broke up and got back together, we can handle forever
Sometimes I think I'm in love with you, sometimes I'm like whatever
Cause you're hot and you're cold
And you're fussing it all
You can't stand the sight of me but still it's love that you show
Cause you the baddest thing bumpin
And the maddest thing talkin
You make the ugliest faces even when I be jokin
I can't stay with you for nothing, only a crazy man would
But I still can never leave you
Cause you look...
Got it in and out when you been breaking my back
You give it to me, give it to me
I ain't giving it back
Get a touch from my ex when I rub once over that
And I reminisce of this of eatin up a kitty cat
Seen the pickin, pick a time on the flow
And I wish that Crystal walk out the door
Do her thing and just about ready to go
But she kiss me, now I can't eat for sho
And you know...

[Chorus]
You love is like schizophrenia
And I be like a-ya-ya-ya
Don't know what done got into you
Maybe I try ya-ya-ya
You love is like schizophrenia
And I be like a-ya-ya-ya
I'll be your strait jacket, hold you tight
I really think you'll be alright now

You make me mad, you make me
You make (like like) crazy
You make me mad, you make me
Make me zone (this shit down)

And since you do it I be talkin about
Delivery... love you
And since you do it I be talkin about
Delivery... love you</pre>
