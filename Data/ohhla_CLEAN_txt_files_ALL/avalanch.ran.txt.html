[Intro]
Hey! {*repeat 8X*}

[Chorus]
We be them, insurgents, not a bit nervous
Encouraged, got bit further to go
By any means, gettin rid of our enemies
A-V, A-L, A-N, C-H-E yeah that's who we be
Av-al-a-n-c-h-e yeah, that's who we be
Insurgents, not a bit nervous
No lip service, got a bit further to go
Do what I gotta kid; who want a problem with
A-V, A-L, A-N, C-H-E yeah that's who we be

[Random]
It's a massive company called Shinra
I don't exactly know what they into
But they wanna get control of the Lifestream
And I just can't let that continue
They don't care who they hurt, who they injure
Want to turn the whole planet against us
So it's simple - you join the resistance
or you wind up goin against us
My name is Barret Wallace and I'm known for paralyizin
Pulverizin punks into submission I ain't fantasizin
Wish this world wasn't violent
It'll get worse if we allow it
Hot head with a cannon for arm
and a mind with nothin but revenge inside it
I represent AVALANCHE - man these chumps don't have a chance
Watch 'em scatter man whenever Barret's layin the battle plans
Got my people beside me
Tifa provides me, with a bit of a voice of reason
Got Biggs, got Wedge and Jessie
Anybody in my way I'm squeezin
Get behind me, I'm leadin
But bombin the region has gotta be the highest treason
But we came too far to back down
I'm not leavin 'til we even
Break it too whoever want it you can get it quick
Now the President of Shinra is throwin fits
It's our world, they can't get control of it
Ain't nobody hoppin off the train 'til it's over with

[Random as Barret]
B, A, R, R, E, one T
They gon' have to come get me if they want me
I don't bend, I don't break, I don't care about much
Just my daughter Marlene and my people bein free
See you gotta understand son, I don't have the answer
I just keep the faith, and I always keep a handgun
No I mean it literal, cause I got a "hand" gun
I call it a gun arm, so I'm never unarmed
Got it as a battle scar, from this chick Scarlett
Weapons developer, caught me in her target
while I tried to save my friend Dyne
I lost my grip, she shook my hand, I thought my friend died
And so I, kept his daughter raised her as my own child
'Til I discovered Dyne was alive and gone wild
Keep goin 'til the planet is at peace
And if somebody's gotta die, guess that's just a small casualty
Keep my hightop fade, and I keep a bad attitude
"Pity the fool" that compare me to that other dude
AVALANCE reppin 'til the day I pass on
And even if I'm gone, the legacy will, last, long

[Chorus]</pre>
