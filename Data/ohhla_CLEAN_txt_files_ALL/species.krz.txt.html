Typed by: AZ Lyrics

You like me (you like me)
I know you do
Don't fight me (don't fight me)
I'll undress you too
You can bite me (you can bite me)
I know you like it rough
Insatiable, she can't get enough
Ayayaya-ah
Never seen a girl so fly-ayayaya-ah
I'm all around the world, you got that fly-ayayaya-ah
She must be an alien, tearin' up every bed she layin' in

What is your species? (What is your species?)
I love the way you smell (I love the way)
What is your species? (What is your species?)
I know and I can't tell (and I can't tell)

Take me there oh take me there
Take me there oh take me there
Take me there oh take me there
Take me there oh take me there

Cutie don't purr it (rawrr)
And a unique set makes primates wild
The opposite's the same but we're all attracted
I can like you not, means you just have to
Hold up! (hold up) It's the war of the worlds
They're fonded in the shape of a girl
Nose who brighteous tans and she eats her mini
From the home cause you're not alone

What is your species? (What is your species?)
I love the way you smell (oh, I love it)
What is your species? (What is your species?)
I know and I can't tell (I can't can't tell)

Take me there oh take me there
Take me there oh take me there
Take me there oh take me there
Take me there oh take me there

I'm outta here (wait up) of my atmosphere (wait up)
If you never had you'll never will
Cause if you got it, you pay the bill
What I'm thinkin' (okay), you can see right through me
I'm kickin' (you are?) from what you do to me
The lights go out, she comes on
I want some (but where you from girl?)
My God baby I really want some (want some more?)
I'm really triggered (off of me you are?)
Now baby listen I'm fallin' (fallin' in love with me?)
How do you know? (what you're thinkin?)
[?]

What is your species? (What is your species?)
I love the way you smell (you smell good)
What is your species? (okay
I know and I can't tell (and I can't can't tell baby)

Take me there oh take me there
Take me there oh take me there
Take me there oh take me there
Take me there oh take me there

Baby, what the hell are you?
What the hell I am</pre>
