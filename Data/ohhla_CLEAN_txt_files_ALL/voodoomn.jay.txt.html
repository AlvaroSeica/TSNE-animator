Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Voodooman, chickenbone chickenbone
I can make a thunderstorm from a light rain
My ears start ringing, My nose get bloody
I feel a lil' bit of pressure on my right brain
Intermission transmission
Put me in submission
Glistening trapped in the light prison whistling
The christ told me come closer to the light man
I went blind woke up in front of a mic stand

Voodoo man, tap dancing in the French Quarter
Walking on water with a scroll in my hand
The bluerprints for disc shaped like a vessel
That was chiseled out of metal
Off the coast of Japan
Fasting on the top of a mountain
I went to postland
Saw a shiny object floating out of the ocean
I'm sort of like a postman
You can get the message if you want to understand
From the rap of the man

Voodoman, civilised and savage
Criticize the parish
Spreading false doctrine
Terrorise the cleric
For carrying on nonsense
Specialised lies to paralyse the conscience

Voodoman
Chit chatter
Abracadabra
Spitting out matter
While I'm shitting out data
Mmm, chew em up shitting out rappers
Sipping Pelegrino while I'm giving out matches
Set yourself on fire
Let the wisdom of Elijah
Purify ya take a nigga higher
Sold your soul to the highest buyer
Now you're on a wire
Talking about 2-foot tires
And you sell crack
Clapping at cats with macs
But you a liar
Pants on fire
Same old rugged cross
Different crucified messiah</pre>
