Sometimes you just gotta show niggaz how you do things

[Noyd] (QB)

[Prodigy] Hear Me Out
Yo... put a bullet in ya mind

[Prodigy]
Yo dun, They caught me from the blind side, me the P

I never left my dawgs out in the cold
I extended my hand wit compassion, you extened yours wit war

Quiet Storm nigga (shhh) leave you shocked for dead

by myself, ???, and just pop ya head

ill see you at the crossroad faggot
and in the mean time, and in between time
P'll layed up wit mo shines, mo dollars fo more nines
More boxes of talons to put in your spine
You cross me nigga, you lost your mind
Scratch that, you never knew me from the start, so I forgive you
After you die squirmin, shots burning (fizzling)

Uh, Its so sweet

(its called) Pay Back
For that shit you'll pulled
I dont respect your gangsta, my guns expload

(its time to) Get Back
Yea, Its so sweet

(its called) Pay Back
For that shit you did
Two wrongs dont make a right, that make it even, bitch

[Noyd]
Ayo when the guns pop, the thugs pop em, everybody kno
Mo Thug been on henny rocks, slingin Fo-Fours

Or pullin out that peice and aimin at ya Kangol
Them thugs, some blood, some crip, some stuntin

Yall heard of, the Queens Bridge fucking Hot Boyz
Prodigy, H, A, V, O, C, and that nigga Noyd

leave 'em dead in the bed and his blood in the streets

(Its the Get Back)

[Havoc]
Basicly, they done summed it up and ain't no reason to spit
but fuck it, lemme have my lil 2 cent
the nine'll leave you so bent
have you huggin the ground like a toilet bowl ready to hurl
you'll be havin outta body visions
and if you lucky to live, no doubt, you'll be find a religion
gittin shot up can do that, most'll squeal
they so shook, the sound of fire crackers makin 'em peel
niggaz rhyme how they kill (kill)
rhyme how they feel (feel)
talkin all that like they ??? for the deal
but me, if I ain't have to... prolly wouldnt clap you
but they see you wit that paper and wanna git at you
I dont preach about the shit, I just show 'em what mack do
you kno these slugs harder than any track you rap to
when cowards talk shit, it just make the finger itch
I got drama for that ass, wanna meet the bitch?
