walking with a little bit of something to sip
I party like I got 24 hours to live
I use to flip since I was a kid
I use to walk around the crib like I was the shit
hip hop, never been the same
old school, slick rick and big daddy cane
cut my name in the side of my fade
I got a 4 finger ring and a big gold chain
and I'm a business man
I'm a tax paying, law abiding citizen
don't be mad at me, cause my shows gross more than your salary
and ima do my thing, and turn my shit up like Radio Raheem
I stay sucka free nucka, what you mean fucka, you's a tree hugga</pre>
