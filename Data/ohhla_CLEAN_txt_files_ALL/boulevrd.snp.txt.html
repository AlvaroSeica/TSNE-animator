[Intro: Jahdan Blakkamore]
Bong diddly diddly bong skang dang!  Diddly bong skang dang! 

[Chorus: Snoop Lion]
As I take a look down the boulevard, for nuff ghetto youth life is very hard
So many face bearin the battle scars, but love I bring to the people come and stray with me
Crisis is what we see, all over the world is pure controversy
When man can put a price on humanity
It seems like the whole world gone crazy

[Verse One: Snoop Lion]
Everybody knows Johnny came from the roughest part of town
Survived the school of hard knocks but still came up and made his chips
The realest life never watered down
Walk with a gun through the heart of town
We hearin BAM BAM BAM a familiar sound
To the youth down in the gully where Johnny born and grow
He never thought that he would make it out
It's like crabs inna barrel, down in the ghet-t-o

[Chorus: Snoop Lion]
As I take a look down the boulevard, for nuff ghetto youth life is very hard
So many face bearin the battle scars, but love I bring to the people come and stray with me
Crisis is what we see, all over the world is pure controversy
When man can put a price on humanity
It seems like the whole world gone crazy

[Verse Two: Snoop Lion]
Poor Johnny Johnny got stuck for his money
Things get funny when yuh romp wid di daddy
Later all the goons pull up in a black caddy
Next dead pon di news dem find anodda dead body
Tales from the inner city
We break it right down to the nitty gritty
Who's responsible for the crime and poverty?!
What a tragedy? Why yoy?!

[Verse Three: Jahdan Blakkamoore]
I wish that I could single handily free
Di entire planet earth from crime and poverty
Lawd mi would a love fi see di day!
When we burn racism, jealousy and hate
Come live everyone should participate
Come enter slavery we would be emancipate
If di bigga heads dem cooperate
Nuttin cyaan stop we from achievin di greatest

[Chorus: Snoop Lion]
As I take a look down the boulevard, for nuff ghetto youth life is very hard
So many face bearin the battle scars, but love I bring to the people come and stray with me
Crisis is what we see, all over the world is pure controversy
When man can put a price on humanity
It seems like the whole world gone crazy</pre>
