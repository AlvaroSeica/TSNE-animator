Chorus: T-Weaponz
Mira, mira
Look, look
Nigga
Tienne miedo, they shook, shook
Nigga
Shorties que tenga el huevo
If niggas want the flame, tomala el fuego

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 1: Ark]
I was raised in the slums, that's the barrio
If you heard me on the radio, that's the radio
See, I came to make a change, that means cambio
Now we got ya niggas all sweatin', here's a pano
That's a napkin
Capitan means I'm captain
Que lo que pasa means what's happenin'
If you see me with my fam, that's my ganga
Shorty got a thong on, that means she got a thanga
If she's dark-skinned, then she's Morena
If you want a problem, you lookin' for problemas
And talk means hablando
Walk is andando
If you see the cops, scream "Bajando" (Bajando!)
Cause if you are a thief, you a ladron
If you got beef with me, T carry your canon
You see, I'm crazy, a loco vato
Drunk, boracho, that's a rap means tato

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 2: Psalmz]
Hello means hola
Time is ahora
If you see a girl by herself, that means she sola
If you see a gun in my hand, that's a pistola
If I say nobody fuckin' move, then no te muevas
Dinero is money
Fello is ugly
Me carajo quieren means what the fuck they want from me
Hambre is hungry
Pobo's a dummy
No me veo llegar means nobody saw me coming
Tomorrow's manana
Weaponz en arma
Go 'head loco, take it easy, means take it with calma
Nothing is nada
Police en la guardia
I say I got your back, then I got your espalda
Bebida means liquor
Asaltos' a stick-up
Venimos a buscarte, we comin' to get ya
Senor means mister
Like (???) a pitcher
Si tu eres mi pana, then that means, you my nigga

Repeat Chorus

Hook: T-Weaponz
What's going on here?
Que lo que pasa aqui
What's going on here?
Que lo que pasa aqui
What's going on here?
Que lo que pasa aqui
What's going on here?
What's going on here?

[Verse 3: IzReal]
Serious, serio, I swear, te juro
We emcees, raperos, not the next Menudo
Don't sing, no canto, I'm a poet, poeta
No saint, no santo, I'm so dope, mantequa
Went Young Hov and back pack, pas atras
So poor, say, "Pobre, no more, mas"
A thug, ditelo
Thinkin', pensando
Look, man, mirame, you dreamin', sonando
Forget, olvidare, pray y resando
Just ask, pidale, 'fore I change el cambio
Single's soltera
Fire's candela
Move, te mueva, like a snake, culebra
Hands, manos, high, alto
All drink and trago, celebrate, celebrando

Repeat Chorus Twice</pre>
