[Verse 1]
Now turn up the product
This for the D shawn S lawn, her mama and her friends
Lisa, Tereza, Maria, Tia Lia and Camp
I love y'all broads no disrespect to my dawgs
But I love y'all broads yeah I love y'all broads
To my ladies having babies without no drama
To my niggas with figure to say I love my baby mama
I bought them shoes them tattoos and even fixed your breast
Put you inside the flyest ride put that S on your chest
This is for the ones who bubblin and put they mouth on it
And they suck everything out of it and they catch it and swallow it
From Louisy fasheezy I'm off to hizzy believe me
See me I'm squeezing between it
And then I leave it so greezy
When I pull up in the rose rice
Leave em with no choice
But to hop up in it and just let me make that dough moist
Ruby Red and Vodka, it just carry a nigga
Give me 3 minutes maybe 4, she be wantin to marry a nigga

[Chorus]
Give me a project bitch
Give me a hood rat chick
One that don't give a fuck
And say she took that (took that)
Give me a project bitch
Give me a hood rat chick
One that don't give a fuck
And say she took that (dick)

[Verse 2]
I know things get hard
But girl you got it, girl you got it
There you go, can't you tell by how they looking at you everywhere you go
Wondering what's on your mind it must be hard to be that fine
When all these mufuckas wanna waste your time is just amazing
Girl and all I can say is, see you and I know you girl
I'm so proud of you
And see you in the melf girl I'm so proud of you
And I see you in the ville girl and I'm so proud of you
Other chicks baddest as fuck, but they ain't real enough

[Chorus]</pre>
