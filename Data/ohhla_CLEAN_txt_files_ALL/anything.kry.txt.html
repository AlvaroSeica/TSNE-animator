[Chorus: Kryme Life]
We live the Kryme Life, nigga, anything goes
Niggas'll put holes in your clothes for the dough
Lay you on the concrete, nigga, die slow
Ain't not rooms in the street, you a fool if you don't think so
Anything goes, so, place ya position, don't get caught
Slippin', nigga, stay on your toes
Anything goes, you gotta eat right
No time for sleep, stay on the grind, get yours

[Kryme Life]
Spit fours, kick down doors
Tie niggas up, find that stash
Get that cash, sling that crack
Knock off every rock, bring that back
Correct, we got to eat, and the check's we all starving
Some get it nine to five, others get it robbing
Got a hunger pain in my stomach, that's gobling
So I rush the club, with a hundred niggas mobbing
It's hot as hell on the boulevard, holding two strings
Trying to make ends meet and we pulling hard
All my butchers who handle beef, showing full regards
You don't wanna be on the corner, when they pulling cards
Get ya team up, clean up, hustle hard, or if you tired
Of working with peanuts like Washington Carver
Peep how, fuck the beater, dangerous with the heater
I'm dumping on 'em, until my click empty then I re-up

[Chorus]

[Kryme Life]
Fuck you, ride slow, buck two, hollows
Coming out them 357 chrome models
Kryme don't know how I flow, you know my motto
Pull a skirt offa nigga, fast, hide through the bottle
See what's inside you, my rooms'll, ride through
It's curtains, and it's no certain we gon' find you
Niggas know we don't do nothing but put work in
These rules survival, niggas'll get hurting
Team on team rivals, scheme on cream ride you
Real easy, back in the days, it seem hard to
Can't come back to the hood, niggas'll starve you
Nickle plate God-U's, laser beams mark you well
For big chips like Jay and R. Kell
And on the strip, Kryme hold weight like barbells
I'm out to get my paper straight like Bronxdale's
Spit it from the heart, blow bark by dark cell
