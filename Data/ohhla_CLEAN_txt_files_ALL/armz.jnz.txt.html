Yeah
That's right

[CHORUS]
I
I just died in your arms tonight
Must have been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight

Inhale every breath
Like a second before your death
'Cause I love you to the end
And the spirit-world begins
Step into the other side
Legendary do or die
Suicide
Who am I
Unless I take the devil's eye

[CHORUS]
I
I just died in your arms tonight
Must have been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight

Listen to these words now
Listen these words shall
Sunspot make it to the holy land, Skirrrrd!!!
Watch the road
And every time you sold your soul
Played yourself
Yo
When you didn't have to
No!
I won't take that
Like a blow
In Genoa, Italy
Globalization woes
If Banana Republic run your broken Republic
You suck corporate dick
Slow death
Sweatshops
The government lowers countries minimum wage
To bait companies to their way
And what can you say
When you living off of three dollars a day
In a house made of clay
We play house like stupid puppets
Say everything to push buttons the way
Love creates the feeling to slay
Oneself
Play oneself
I can't say I dealt
I felt like shit
I felt like hit
Me with the bullet
Take my spirit
Pull it
Out my body
Pull it
Out in front of everybody
Prove your point
Unemotionally I walk the streets
Devoted to eternity
In this broken society
Broken chronic weed inside of me
Has mixed this energy
Intensity
To where there's no stoppin' me
Stoppin' me

[CHORUS]
I
I just died in your arms tonight
Must have been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight

This is for the times that we lost
'Cause we all live here
Lost
This is the times that we lost
'Cause we all live here
Lost

[CHORUS]
I
I just died in your arms tonight
Must have been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight

I miss you like I miss dope hip-hop
It just stopped and got all diluted
Convoluted
Unrooted
So the resistance fights for hopes the new day
New ways to freak the speak who lays
Lyrical food trays
Feed the people the culture
Seed the feeble poachers
My brains like ivory
My Novocain mentality
Too many nights on Ecstasy
It's so hard to see
Beauty when it's not me
Adrenelaine like he
Pain up in me
Anger helps me free what they try to do to me on TV
Playing me socially
Scared of we
Living out a stereotype and glamour tonight
I'ma be
What you could never be
I'ma let you see
What you thought you could never see
I be who the fuck I am when you scared to be
Within originality
While suckas O.D
And become a broke-ass O.G
You try to fuck me
Like the 2008 Olympics
And Tibet ain't free
You ain't looking out for me
You looking out for greed
So until your ass see
We revolutionary
As we step in the store keep it running and don't you dumb-ass be scary

[CHORUS]
I
I just died in your arms tonight
Must have been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight

This is for the times that we lost
'Cause we all live here
Lost
This is the times that we lost
'Cause we all live here
Lost

[CLIP FROM MOVIE]
"Hey"
"Hey"
[Grunts and groans] "So - I guess this is goodbye, huh?"
"I want you to forgive me"
"For what?"
"For this." [gunshot]</pre>
