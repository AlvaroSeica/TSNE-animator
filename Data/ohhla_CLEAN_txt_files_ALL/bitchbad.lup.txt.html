[Intro]:
Yeah! I say!
Bitch bad, woman good, lady better
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!  

[Verse One]:
Now imagine as a shorty maybe five maybe fo'
Ridin 'round with his mama listenin to the radio
And a song comes on, and a not far from bein born
Doesn't know the difference between right, and wrong
Now I ain't tryin to make it, too complex
But let's just say shory has an undeveloped context
About the perception of women, these days
His mama sings along, and this what she says
"Niggas I'm a bad bitch, and I'm bad bitch"
"Sum'n else and far above average"
And maybe other rhymin words like cabbage and savage
And baby carriage and other things that match it
Couple of things are happenin here, first he's relatin the word
Bitch with his mama, comma
And because she's relatin to herself is most important source of health
And, mental health, he may skew respect, for dishonor

[Chorus]:
Bitch bad, woman good, lady better, hey misunderstood!
Uh! Tell 'em! Bitch bad, woman good, lady better, hey misunderstood!
They misunderstood! Yeah! (I'm killin these bitches!!!)

[Verse Two]:
Now imagine a group of little girls nine through twelve
On the internet watchin videos listenin to songs by themselves
It doesn't really matter if they have parental clearance
They understand the internet, better than their parents
Now being the internet, the content's probably uncensored
They're young, so they're malleable and probably unmentored
A complicated combination maybe with no relevance
Until their intelligence meets their favorite singer's preference
"Bad bitches, bad bitches, bad bitches... (Ooooooh, yeah bad bitches~!)
That's all I want and all I like in life is bad bitches, bad bitches"
Now let's say that they less concerned with him
And more with the video girl acquiescent to his whims
...Ah, the plot thickens
High heels, long hair, fat booty, slim
Reality check, I'm not trippin
They don't see a paid actress, just what makes a bad bitch

[Chorus]:
Bitch bad, woman good, lady better, hey misunderstood!
I say! I say! I say! I say! I say! I say! Bitch bad, woman good, lady better, hey misunderstood!
You're the greatest!!! (I'm killin these bitches!!!)

[Verse Three]:
Disclaimer, this rhy-mer Lupe's, not usin bitch, as a lesson
But as a psychological weapon
to set in, your mind and really mess with your conceptions
Discretions, reflections, it's clever misdirection
Cause - while I was rappin they was growin up, fast
Nobody stepped in, to ever slow 'em up, gasp
Sure enough, in this little world
The little boy meets, one of those little girls
And he thinks she a bad bitch, and she thinks she a bad bitch
He thinks disrespectfully, she thinks of that sexually
She got the wrong idea, he don't wanna fuck her
He thinks she's bad, at bein a bitch, like his mother
Momma never dressed like that, come out the house hot mess like that
Ass, titties, breasts like that, all out to impress like that
Just like that, you see the fruit of the confusion
He caught in a reality, she caught in an illusion
Bad mean good to her, she really nice and smart
But bad mean bad to him, bitch don't play your part
But bitch still bad to her if you say it the wrong way
But she thinks she a bitch, what a double entendre (tell 'em)

[Chorus]:
Bitch bad, woman good, lady better, hey misunderstood!
I say! I say! I say! I say! I say! I say! Bitch bad, woman good, lady better, hey misunderstood!
 (I'm killin these bitches!!!)

[Outro]:
Bitch bad, woman good, lady better, hey misunderstood!
You're misunderstood! (I'm killin these bitches!!!!)
Bitch bad, woman good, lady better, pray this motherhooooooooooddddddd!!!!
Eh Yeahhhhhhhhhhhh!!!! (I'm killin these bitches!!!!)
