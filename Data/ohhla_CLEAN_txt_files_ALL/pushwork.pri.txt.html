The speaker's busted man, you gotta make it work
It sounds like shit
You look like shit man too, but you know you make it work, I guess
You know what, everybody here's all dressed up
You all look like shit, ok

I think everything's broken, I stink, everyone's smokin'
I ring everyone's coke in, I blink, everyone's spoken
We hit the clubs, we hit the drugs, boring
We say goodbye, on the bed I lie, shit

I see that you ain't happy, I see it while you're laughing
So if everything hurts, gotta push, make it work

Push, make it work
Push, make it work, push, push, make it work, ah
Push, push, make it work, ha, push, oh make it work, uh
Sounds like shit

We're all out of control, runnin' up the sides of a bowl
I wonder why it's so hard, maybe we just need brand new cars
Ah, you ain't happy, I see it while you're dancing
So if everything hurts, gotta push, make it work

Licks, kicks, tricks, I'm sick, time to get fixed
I said licks, kicks, tricks, I'm sick, I wanna get fixed, I wanna, get fixed

Ah, I forgot the words
Oh yeah, you can't have everything all at once
You don't even know what you want, cunts
Push, make it work, push, make it work
Push, push, make it work, push, push, make it work, yeah, yeah
Push, push, make it work, yeah, yeah, push, push, make it work, yeah, yeah
Push, push, make it work, yeah, yeah, push, push, make it work, yeah, yeah
Push, push, make it work, yeah, yeah, push, push, make it work, yeah, yeah
Push, push, make it work, yeah, yeah, come on</pre>
