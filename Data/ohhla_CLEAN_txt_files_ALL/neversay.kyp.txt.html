[Verse 1]
Hey kid, you know I'd love to stay and catch up
You caught me on a bad day, but
You'll see me when your eyes are shut
As you're risin' up
OK - and what I really mean to stay
One day we're gonna meet again and it'll be the same
'Cause even when I'm gone you hear me in my song say

[Chorus]
Every life, first the sun then the night falls
We're all on borrowed time, I'll never say goodbye
Take your time, live your life like it's last call
Don't wanna see you cry, we'll never say goodbye

[Verse 2]
Back when life was easy and innocent
In a simple world ignorant
Stealing cigarettes, going to get high, drinking some Rye
Then again, we're all the same thing in the end
Butterflies lose their wings and ascend
So do friends - memories resurrect a new life for the dead
So any time that you want to see me
Raise a glass, reminisce - take it easy
Just close your eyes, I'll be right there with your soul inside
And there's no goodbyes
I wish I had a hankerchief so I could wipe those eyes
I saw my moms at the funeral, she spoke so nice
Like, "What a great kid, don't believe those lies"

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Don't ever say goodbye, don't ever say goodbye
Never say goodbye (Ever say goodbye)

[Verse 3]
So kid, don't mourn, take your life back
Cape Diem and all that
Really matters today is today see
The more you live the happier I'll be
You'd better take your time and shine
Everybody gotta learn sometime that there's no goodbyes
'Cause after every nightfall a new sun will rise

[Chorus 2x]
