"Street life"
A-yo the street life is the only life I know
The street life is the only life I know
Yo the street life, yo the street life
Yo the street life, yo the street life       (x2)

Jeff Valentino:
I reach my masters in the wildest pastures
I think quick to gash for the cash I need to capture
A modern day Dracula I walk the Heights at night
Hardcore like ice man verses life pay the price
Now you can witness mines throughout the rhymes
I blind for the legal mind they claimin' that I'm outta line
They never understand minds unless they in it
So do all these street peoples a favor just go about your buisness
What is this?
The cops is goin' out with the girls on the block
Now here's the plot they want to get us all locked
I think now, we too ahead of the plan
Niggas can't understand my man in the caravan
Scopin' out the NYPD strickly
With binoculars and high tech technology
Now you can ask for last wifey when she actin' shiesty
Yo the hon tried to play more scenes then Spike Lee
Yo but I took it lighty cause there's cats wanting to snipe me
My shit is so pure the government will sacrifice me
The street life yeah the street life ah yeah the street life
Yo the street life

Hook:
For everyday that goes by I ask why
I had to struggle we had to stuggle 
To build somethin' out of nothin' we ain't frontin'
We known to keep the party jump your bass pumpin'       (x2)

Butta Lee:
I walk these hot streets but my feet don't burn
I earn plus learn that this world still turns
For the good or the bad when I was broke ass
Now I got cash ass sweet tabs and hash
And niggas don't even want to stop to talk 
Now I feel like a rat and y'all niggas is hawks
Always peepin' and watchin' every move I make
Hopin' that I slip up and let you know where's my wake
Wait I'm a let you know where it's stored at
It's kept above my neck lethal when I inject
I mean when I inhale my plan never fails
Y'all airheaded niggas blow a hole in ya ceil
Take a hit of the ale then prepare for warfare
The nightmares of electrical chairs and FED affairs
Have a nigga mad bent on the streets 
Have a nigga ready to creep
And blow a niggas head piece
A-yo the street life is the only life I know
The street life is the only life I know
Yo the street life, yo the street life 
Yo the street life, yo the street life       (x2)
