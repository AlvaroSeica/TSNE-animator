[Chorus]
Rubber band banks (boing yoing yoing yoing)
Tokyo Diamonds (joing yoing yoing yoing)
Grand Hustle ice (it be glowing yoing yoing yoing)
When we in the club (they think its snowing yoing yoing yoing)
28 inches (in the A yay yay yaer)
We be deep (everywhere yer yer yer)
Bitches want me (cause ima play yay yay yaer)
You know I got them choppas (cause ima spray yay yay yaer)

[Verse 1]
Ima outer space balla, put you up on astronomy
Mathamatically with a pistol I do trigonometry
Humbly, eat up a nigga like a piranha B
Ridin in the cuttlass same color as a bumble bee
I had to man I brought the flip flop jag through
Paint the Chevy sad blue, you know my devi sad blue
Ride straight pass you, my choppas will outlast you
I promise ima smash you, 30 us sixes blast you
600 see through benz call it the glass coup
Diamonds look like Passion Fruit, Viper look like Apple Fruit
Ride through the hood you know the Burban look like Snaple Juice
Bricks from back facts, from Summa Hill Pappa 2
Rapper who, bitch you know I'm the Best Thang Smokin
Hit em in the neck with the Tech, and leave ya throat smokin
Dro Rollin, bitch I got a million for yo million
We up in these hoods trappin, buildin after buildin

[Chorus]
Rubber band banks (boing yoing yoing yoing)
Tokyo Diamonds (joing yoing yoing yoing)
Grand Hustle ice (it be glowing yoing yoing yoing)
When we in the club (they think its snowing yoing yoing yoing)
28 inches (in the A yay yay yaer)
We be deep (everywhere yer yer yer)
Bitches want me (cause ima play yay yay yaer)
You know I got them choppas (cause ima spray yay yay yaer)

[Verse 2]
I love flippin down screens, and love ridin 23's
Love glidin down the street, and love watchin Lean On Me
Love payin Ten-a-Key, love sellin pounds of weed
Love in the club when my thugs all surrounding me
Ain't nobody bouncing me, DJ is announcing me
Shawty say she want Dro, I think she want a ounce of me
Fed's tryin to pounce on me, I'm loyal than a mount'lgee
Shawty say she fuck with Grand Hustle bitch bounce with me
Ice come from Tokyo, roll like the rolla poll
5 blunts of total dro, I think I'm bout to overdose
Trunk ain't bumpin and jumpin, it got the holy ghost
Bricks by the 50, 10 naw shawty 40 more
Trap time nigga, yeah strap time nigga put out better rubber band
Crap time nigga, in my lap a nine nigga
45 in the console, show em how the reversable clip'll do a drum roll

[Chorus]
Rubber band banks (boing yoing yoing yoing)
Tokyo Diamonds (joing yoing yoing yoing)
Grand Hustle ice (it be glowing yoing yoing yoing)
When we in the club (they think its snowing yoing yoing yoing)
28 inches (in the A yay yay yaer)
We be deep (everywhere yer yer yer)
Bitches want me (cause ima play yay yay yaer)
You know I got them choppas (cause ima spray yay yay yaer)

[Verse 3]
28 inches (in the A ya yaer)
G4 (in the A ya yaer)
Young Dro (ladies in my hair ya yaer)
Bitches want me (cause ima play yay yaer)
Rock Cartier, Ima Chief like an Indian
Freaks are Caribbean, my feets are amphibian
Prototype bentley with ??? in the vivian
Dark sniper ridin in the Viper up in Michigan
Fuckin with my clique'll get you lost like Gilligan
Dro is on the pill again I promise Ima kill again
Yall fake niggas how the fuck could you be real again
Murder all foes I trap em up than I seal em in
Rubber band fitted, S Yutan Chevy, Straight drop Glad got that S Yutan ready
Cutlass Cam ready paint, extra Cranberry
Ice Cream Chevy, nigga Ben &amp; Jerry</pre>
