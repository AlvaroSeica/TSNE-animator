[Intro: Solomon Childs]
You going already right? Uh, huh
Ya'll niggas get it, right?
Hahaha, you get it, uh

[Chorus: Solomon Childs]
It's that real live murda shit
This that real live, kick a nigga in his dick
This that straight live, I'm just saying
This that real live murda shit, I ain't playing
It's that real live murda shit
This that real live, pop a nigga in his hip
This that straight live, I'm just saying
This that real live murda shit, I ain't playing

[Solomon Childs]
My entourage live by the gun code
Ritual over pit bull blood, animals deceased
Infested venom, when I spit blood in these raps
I put rats on they back
Or in a hole, where it's wet and cold
I put a	bullet in your big head bitch, with a big nose
Fronting like Beyonce Knowles, split your beer gut
Like a fat pig, bury you alive where you can't dig ya way out
Penitentiary war, you got no clout
Your time's running out old man
And automatic's don't jam
This is murda shit, brought by heavy demand
Nigga bow to the young Al Qaeda
Or get dragged through the town like a traitor
Starsky music, nigga, pay notes
I get head from hoes that resemble Pepper Dennis, like John Stamos
(White bitches, nigga!)

[Chorus]

[Solomon Childs]
Uh, black opera, wild safari
Jungle Menanti, heavyweight sypnosis
Follow, or you'll be added to the deathlist
Nigga, die fast, pain in my upper ass
I'm dying already, so ain't nothing for me to blast
Dishonor before death, automatic's spit side arm from the left
The Tali' glitch, cold kick, I send 'em at ya baby mother, you bitch
No homo, when you walk, you switch
When the sonic flu color, breath from the nose of the cannon you snitch
Certified hoodlum nigga, lived that boulevard terrordome
Centerfold military edition of Rolling Stone, with power, like
Brian Nichols caught off with the chrome
I spit a straight insilin coma
Magnified, nigga, the sea stone roamer

[Chorus] </pre>
