"Working late tonight doctor..?"

[Intro]
Oh yeah, we here
That's right, man, my niggas
Light that shit up, light that shit up, oh yeah
Check the bottle is cracked at
It's been live for the homies, that's R.I.P. you feel me
What y'all niggas know run down the line like this

[Verse 1: Prodigy]
Before I get the watch, I get the big glock
Before I step foot in the V, I get the stash box
No matter the occasion I'm bringin' my heat
Take my kids accessory place, I'm bringin' my heat
For show, you never know, it might pop off
Better safe, than sorry niggas could never rob me
Or reach they hand towards me in any type fashion
Fuck what you heard and think, my shit's blastin'
We here in the club, I get my contraband in
You fuckin' with us, you rather suck maaad dick
Before I squeeze, I aim for ya head than
Without hesitation turn your shit backwards
Soon as I purchase my kicks I put the gem stars in
So if they lock me up, my razor make mad hits
Before I die the world gon' hear me
And make me rich, my kids will be filthy

[Hook: Prodigy]
Priorities - my gun on, I'm ready for the day
Two - tryin' to hit you before you hit me
C - here a good nigga don't cross P
Four - balance my hatred and love more
E - tryin' to stay alive I only live once
Six - never let fear control me dunn
G - make the money money never made me
Eight - live by Four and shit'd be straight

[Verse 2: Prodigy]
Nigga I don't shoot cars up, or shoot doors up
That shit I did when I was sixteen, word up
That's child's play now I got a taste for blood
I gotta see some meat hangin' 'fore the job's well done
I need to see a nigga drop before I make my gun stop
And before I start shootin' I make sure you hops
Niggas wind me up and wind me up
Till I pop up on your scene like Jack-in-a-box
With the two topics cuttin' at you like butter
VA style nigga you meat get smothered
Mobb style nigga me and my blood brothers, kill
Pretty boy rappers if they song speak of us
Oh you shot niggas before? That's cool with me
But you gonna need experience toolin' with P
Before I came to Q.B. I was already thug
Before all this rap shit I was already bugged

[Hook: Prodigy]
Priorities - my gun on, I'm ready for the day
Two - tryin' to hit you before you hit me
C - here a good nigga don't cross P
Four - balance my hatred and love more
E - tryin' to stay alive I only live once
Six - never let fear control me dunn
G - make the money money never made me
Eight - live by Four and shit'd be straight

[Outro]
- Heard the one about the two bulls?
. Not yet..
- Not yet.. well these two bulls are sittin on a grassy knoll,
  overlookin a herd of Guernseys..
  And the baby bull says "Hey pop, let's run down and..
  .. fuck one of those cows"
  But the papa bull says "No son..
  .. let's walk down and fuck 'em all"</pre>
