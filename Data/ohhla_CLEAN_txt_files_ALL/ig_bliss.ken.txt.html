[Kendrick Lamar]
Lord, forgive me... kill him where he stand
Then stand over him, shake his hand, then jump back in that minivan
Double back to his block and blam, I ain't backing down for nothing
I'm back 'em down like Shaq' with this black .223 in my hand
Better pray that this chopper jam like a radio single man
Police radio signal saying that a one-eighty-seven land
on your corner, coroners comfort your mama, mama he's dead, the next morning
high toasted up with my homies, we drink and smoke marijuana
Want us to change our ways? Uh huh, you see this game we play come from
uncles that raised me in Compton, ask me what I have accomplished
I don't know, I don't have conscience, I just load up and start dumping
on enemies, I'm head-hunting, no sympathy, ain't no love when
you in these streets, just get something, protect your neck cause they coming
for set respects, split your onion, then chop your deck, your head tumbling like gymnastics
cause ignorance is bliss

[Chorus]
Now everybody put your hands up high
If you don't give a fuck, put your hands up high

[Kendrick Lamar]
This the hardest shit you heard from L.A. this far
and I'm this far from a discharge, but never will I diss y'all
We all tryna ball, and when I got the rock I'll dish off
until the day I pistol whip you posers till y'all pissed off
then peel off in a hoopty, come back and make these niggas wanna shoot me
and they bitches wanna salute me or seduce me
Indubitably I'm too street, indubitably I'ma do me better than your bitch would
But you niggas too weak, but just give me two weeks and I'm good
I'll make an album that will put a smile on Malcolm
Make Martin Luther tell God I'm the future for Heaven's talent
No tarot card reading, I'm foreseeing you niggas vanish
Not only from the rap game, I'm including the planet
Cats so watered down, clowns can sink Titanic
Tie titanium around they neck and watch 'em panic
Give me respect damn it, or get damaged
Die young, corpse identified by your parents, apparently you a parrot
Mocking me and my blueprint, but I won't share it
Just make you +cop+ it, then call you a sheriff, stop it
I'm hearing the comments, the critics are calling me conscious
But truthfully, every shooter be calling me Compton
So truthfully, only calling me Kweli and Common
proves that ignorance is bliss

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
And this still the hardest shit you've heard from L.A. this far
and I'm this far from a discharge, but never will I diss y'all
It's my world, I grab the universe then play kickball
and they wonder why these California earthquakes hitting so hard
I'm SoCal, you so-called, rappers need to go call
Ghostbusters to shoot busters, I'm Casper when I go off
I show up to show out and show off, you a hundred percent behind me
And if you hard then wreck your car, then walk up to my crime scene
I remember being seventeen wishing someone would sign me
Now the only way these labels get me back is when they rewind me
Backing down bargains, backing down bitches
We gon' flip her when she off that blue dolphin, you gon' tip her
cause ignorance is bliss
And Willie B, I'm a fool on your beats
I bleed out the speaker as the speaker that spoke when they didn't speak</pre>
