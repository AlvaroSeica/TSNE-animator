[Slug - Verse 1]
I thought I saw you yesterday
But I didn't stop 'cause you was walking the opposite way
I guess I could have shouted out your name
But even if it was you, I don't what I would say
We can sit and reminisce about the old school
Maybe share a cigarette because we both fools
Chop it up and compare perspectives
Life, love, stress and set backs
Yes, you could tell me how hard you had it
And you could show me all the scars to back it
And we can analyze each complaint
Break it down and explain these mistakes I make
I like to tangle up the strings of the puppetry
But you knew me back when I was a younger me
You've seen Sean in all types of life
And I've been meaning to ask you if I'm doing alright

Yesterday, was that you
Looked just like you
Strange things my imagination might do
Take a breath reflect on what we've been through
Or am I just going crazy 'cause I miss you

Yesterday, was that you
Looked just like you
Strange things my imagination might do
Take a breath reflect on what we've been through
Or am I just going crazy 'cause I miss you

[Slug - Verse 2]
I'm shook, I know
I pushed when I should have pulled
Took it all back if I could I put that on my soul
And I would make a top notch good listener
If you could block off a little time out to give it here
Since we went our separate paths
I've hits a couple of snags
That remind me of the past
I cant front I'm having a blast
But damned if I ain't afraid of how long it's gonna last
Sitting here wishing we could kick it
Gimme your opinions I do miss the criticisms
I didn't mean to be distant
Make a visit
I'll wait up and keep the coffee brewing in the kitchen
But who am I jokin' with
Theres no way that you and I will ever get to re-open it
It doesn't matter, this is more than love
And maybe if I'm lucky, I'll get to see you out the corner of

Yesterday, was that you
Looked just like you
Strange things my imagination might do
Take a breath reflect on what we've been through
Or am I just going crazy 'cause I miss you

[Slug - Verse 3]
And when you left, I didn't see it coming
I guess I slept, it ain't like you was running
You crept out the front door slow
And I was so self-absorbed, I didn't even know
And 'bout the time I looked up, it was booked up
Put it all behind you, the bad and the good stuff
A whole house full of dreams and steps
I think you'd be impressed with the pieces I've kept
You disappreared, but the history is still here
That's why I try not to cry over spilt beer
I can't even get mad that you're gone
Leaving me is probably the best thing you ever taught me
I'm sorry, it's official - I was a fistful, I didn't keep it simple
Chip on the shoulder, anger in my veins
Had so much hatred, now it brings me shame
Never thought about the world without you
And I promise that I'll never say another bad word about you
I thought I saw you yesterday, but I know it wasn't you
'Cause you passed away, dad

Looked just like you
Strange things my imagination might do
Take a breath reflect on what we've been through
Or am I just going crazy 'cause I miss you</pre>
