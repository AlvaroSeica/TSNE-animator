[Rubbabandz]
Look at shorty ass, look at how it move
I sware she know how to make it do what it do
I'm on the dance floor with a cup full of booze
Spilling my drink, acting like a God damn fool
Ooh wee, she working that back
She don't know how to act, I don't know how to act
Slow motion with it, I got a cup full of 'gnac
From the bar to the floor to the car to the room
How ya punk ass man get the number to this room
Better put him in his place 'fore I put him in the tomb
I'm a wolf ass nigga hollering at a full moon
I do dirt you couldn't sweep up with a broom
I'mma hit 'em with the bang, and I hit 'em with the boom
I put my own work, I don't have to send goons
It don't take much for me to come out my cocoon
To a hood near you, Bandz coming real soon

[Chorus: Rubbabandz]
Let me see you shake that ass, like you trying to break something
Let me see you shake that ass, like you trying to break something
Let me see you shake that ass, like you trying to break something
Let me see you shake that ass, like you trying to break something
Let me, let me see you work that, you know how to work that
Back that thing up, shorty you can work that
I don't wanna hurt that, bet you won't throw it back
Let you bring it over to the crib, I murk that

[Rubbabandz]
Drop it like it's hot, let me get behind that
You see shorty ass? Tell the DJ rewind that
Bring it back, I should of brought a stack
She just overcook the way she working that back
Don't move, I wanna fuck just like that
Pull ya pants down, just a little bit, like that
Like that? Just like that, bring it on back
Back, back, back that ass up, bring it on back
Back, back, don't stop, drop it to the floor
Bring it back up, drop it one more
Time, shorty in the club getting shine
Look at these hoes hating, cuz she on the grind
Niggas hating too, but they know the time
They wanna get at her, fall back, get in line
These dudes know better, I pay 'em nevermind
Yeah, we in the club, but I still got my nine

[Chorus]

[Rubbabandz]
Damn shorty, you know how to really work that
Come here for a minute, let me borrow your back
The way you looking in them pants, I can't understand
Come on, get it in, with the million dollar man
Rubbabandz, bounce back any way I can
And I got to confess, I'm your number one fan
The way that thing looking in that bow legged stance
Go 'head girl, do that dance, nevermind if you slide
Down the pole, doing the handstand
Jump in my lap, and ride with no hands
I'm a go getter, get it any way I can
I'm a game spitter, get ya ass out of jam
I don't see no rings on ya finger, forget ya man
It's party time, Biggie said 'give me one more chance'
And put ya hands in the air, I wanna see you dance
And shake what you got in them pants, go 'head girl

[Chorus]</pre>
