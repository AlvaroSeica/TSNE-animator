[Chris Brown]
Eyes must be wide shut
Liquor got you open closing the blinders
Just in case you need a friendly reminder
Let me take this bullet, bullet out right here
Change your body I need adviser
Hard to beat but fuck it don't need a driver
All me want is a girl who'll be a rider
Can't believe she pull it, pull it - nigga gun cock pow

[Chorus One]
But she want me to hold her, hold her down
Sorry boo boo you gets no love, no love nah
Must be coocoo got me fucked up, fucked up wow (you got me fucked up)
You know a nigga ain't gonna hold her, hold her down

[Chorus Two]
I'm a mirage, what? Fuck I look like?
I'm a mirage - what the fuck I look like
It's all in your mind, your mind - fuck I look like?
Open your eyes, you're blind, what the fuck I look like?

[Chris Brown]
Yeah yeah you're mind said I should apologize to ya
People tellin all of those crazy lies to ya
You believe 'em all don't wanna accept the truth
Who the fuck you kiddin, kiddin - what's the use?
Sad to see you playin the fool
You don't know half the shit a nigga been through
I guess you got your reward, reward
for, actin like you don't need me babe

[Chorus One] + [Chorus Two]

[Nas]
Yeah; you lookin for love and I'm the one you imagine
With athlete money from just rappin
My body wrapped in, Sir Valentino, Lauren Piana fashion
Sex with passion, romancin, laughin
Happiness, action, restaurants, relaxing
They got some good sushi in aspen, the good pussy I'm smashin
I call you Masa-Hisa, yeah I'm your Visa
American Express I must confess
I'm tryin to go beyond love, and this is hard to translate
Love is good but to me, good is just the enemy of great
You wanna make it to the top but you don't got what it takes
to be a model, actress, singer, stripper
Want me to help you to become a star you was my sister
You was my soldier, damn I used to miss you
I used to love you, I think to hold you
You didn't know me it was only - just a mirage, mirage

[Chorus Two]

[Chris Brown]
What the fuck I look like? 
Fucked up
What the fuck I look like?</pre>
