[Intro]
That's right ugh, check it out
Back in tha days where tha people were fresh
It was one mc who had to pass tha test
He was down by law, and he's ready to play
That's right yawl, it's hostyle today

[Hostyle]
Yo yo, yo
Woke up in tha morning and my eggs was part
Turned on tha boob toob saw tha million man march
Tha cops in DC, had to play scared
Gotta a, warn in plans looking at tha quaters of France
Ants in my pants so i dips in tha door
Picked up tha keys, caught a telephone call
She yelling bones in my sounds swell
I'm like why can't, a brother can't rise up
All i'm hearing is clobbers, hung up
Lighted some butter, food tight in my gutter
Shouted lover, to those hungry
Put holes in they clothes
Bitch niggas throwing weak shit in tha game
On tha streets, smoking dough and leak on tha heap

Chorus: Hostyle

H-o-s-t-y-l-e
    (tha drug pushers and face mushers)
Those them types that fuck wit me
    (throw ya henny in tha sky)
H-o-s-t-y-l-e   
    (tha bread winners, tha money getters)
Those them types that fuck wit me   
    (lets get this m-o-n-e-y)
H-o-s-t-y-l-e
    (tha henny guzzelers, and tha henny huzzelers)
Those them types that fuck wit me
    (this is serious b-i)
H-o-s-t-y-l-e   
    (tha thug chicks who love dick)
Those them types that fuck wit me   
    (lets get this money till we die)

[Hostyle]
Climax a vocal, like tha local weed spot
Dime bags i go through, I'm at tha penical of smoke signals
Tree's in a tight squeeze, night breeze
For i blow hair might freeze, somebody give me a light please
Matter fact I got matches I strike these don
Son where you coming from, vernon fourty one
Here ya shorty come, know she calling me for what
She ignoring me, unless she horny and I got some trojans on me
I just stop start smiling, hands on her hips posing for me
I limped over wit laughter
Told me to meet me a quarter after three, 
and smacked her on the ass cheek
Ghetto thug classy, if you ask me, if you ask me

Chorus

[Hostyle]

Aiyyo its Queensbridge, Kyron, KL, and Poet is who I flow with
And you know it that (Those tha types that fuck with me)
And stuck with me thick and thin 
Industry dog kickin in, ways wicked to win
Mo' green baby, attendin the warfare, yeah it all seems crazy
HAAA'STYLE, yeah I fiend for the gravy
SCREWBALL, yeah we ?need to? like babies
Dogs locked up in the kennel
Going at the pops, calling the kennel black
Cock the metal back, and settle that
Vibe level that, rhyme rebel rap, so I don't miss it
Yeah, we the who head click so everybody twist it
