Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Batman, I want you do me a favor
What?
Sing a song for me ... love'em
Oh all right hm hm

[Chorus x2]
You Robin
I'm Batman
you just a sidekick
no playin' back man
I ain't jokin' around
And don't stoppin' me
All this ice got me cold like Mister Freeze

[Verse 1]
I'm In my new whip, look at the wheels
Black R8 Lookin like the batmobile
I'm runnin' things, I'ma charge
Far as I could see (WHAT?)
I'm RA-D-AR (YEAH!)
I'm doin' feats
We don't mould the same
A bunch of damon wayans
These niggaz is Major pains
Run in the Crib Rap Like fuck it
Rather go at Hollywood
and go my laughin shit

[Chorus x2]
You Robin
I'm Batman
you just a sidekick
no playin' back man
I ain't jokin' around
And don't stoppin' me
All this ice got me cold like Mister Freeze

[Verse 2]
Where my competition at?
White tee (WHAT?) Cincinnati fitted cap (OHIO)
I'm still here, I got the glow
Never stop ground and I got it on my own
Man, told you a minute for a long hour
so many women I think feelin' out my call love
I set a .... YMCMB that's the fuckin crew

[Chorus x2]
You Robin
I'm Batman
you just a sidekick
no playin' back man
I ain't jokin' around
And don't stoppin' me
All this ice got me cold like Mister Freeze

[Bridge]
Look like a ... [x12]

These niggaz can't do it like I do it nigga</pre>
