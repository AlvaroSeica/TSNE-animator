[Hook: JD]
They my enemies
Dressed in my friends clothes
Dick ridin thinkin I don't
They my enemies
Dressed in my friends clothes
Smile in my face but pop shit behind doors
I wake up, knowin I'm bout to see 'em all in my face
Like what up, these motherfuckers all over the place
Im fet up, homie I'm angry and I need me my space
And good luck, with all that thinkin you gon take my place

[Verse 1: JD]
Its a lotta niggaz in this club poppin bub thats phony
Actin like they got nothin but love for the homie
Straight 2-faced, they like them niggaz at Sony
Now ain't you the mayor?, I'm the one and only
For as long as me and my niggaz been hittin this town like a storm
And now you gotta see me and Penny arm to arm
One day you'll get it, keep tryin nigga
Yeah right you ballin, keep lyin nigga
I know a lotta ballas, half of 'em hate me
Bankrupt but you must ain't seen my mobs lately
Be damned if you like me, give a fuck what you rate me
I only know 2 words and nigga thats pay me
Now we finna stop talkin shit about JD
Cuz he been doin this shit since y'all was babies
How you gon, try to degrade me
Yall ain't my friends, nigga I ain't crazy

[Hook: JD]
They my enemies
Dressed in my friends clothes
Dick ridin thinkin I don't
They my enemies
Dressed in my friends clothes
Smile in my face but pop shit behind doors
I wake up, knowin I'm bout to see 'em all in my face
Like what up, these motherfuckers all over the place
Im fet up, homie I'm angry and I need me my space
And good luck, with all that thinkin you gon take my place

[Verse 1: J-Kwon]
Now Ima check and chill til the moment I lose mine
And when I lose mine, gun stores gon lose lines
I thought you knew, Kwon keep 8 on the waste line
Im from the Lou, Kwon flip 8's to waste time
I spit it, for niggaz who don't feel my shit
She a whore, I don't like her you can deal my bitch
You wanna war?, what for?, I peel this bitch
Body liftin, done with it, I don't need this shit
You my enemy
Dressed in my friends clothes
But when I shoot I do better than Shaq shootin freethrows
A buncha niggaz trippin, they got the game wrong
A buncha niggaz feelin like me who bumpin the same song
Im evil, while you thinkin you gon take my spot
Wait til my album drop, quit thinkin you pop
And you rappin hardcore when you knowin you pop
And you sayin you a 'rilla when you knowin you not
