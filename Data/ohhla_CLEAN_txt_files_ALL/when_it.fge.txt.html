Song:   When it Hurts So Bad
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash (from liner notes)

When it hurts so bad (when it hurts so bad)
When it hurts so bad (when it hurts so bad)
Why's it feel so good? (when it hurts so bad)
(when it hurts so bad)

When it hurts so bad (when it hurts so bad)
When it hurts so bad (when it hurts so bad)
Why's it feel so good? (when it hurts so bad)
(when it hurts so bad)

I loved real, real hard once
But the love wasn't returned
Found out the man I'd die for
He wasn't even concerned
I tried, and I tried, and I tried
to keep him in my life (to keep him in my life)
I cried, and I cried, and I cried
but I couldn't make it right

But I, I loved the young man
And if you ever been in love
then you'd understand

That what you want might make you cry
What you need might pass you by
If you don't catch it (if you don't catch it)
(if you don't catch it)

And what you need ironically
will turn out what you want to be
If you just let it (if you just let it)
If you just let it (if you just let it)

See, I thought this feeling
it was all that I had
But how could this be love
and make me feel so bad? (gave up my power)
Gave up my power
I existed for you
But who-ever knew
the voo-doo you'd do

But I, I loved the young man
And if you ever been in love
then you'd understand

What you want might make you cry
What you need might pass you by
If you don't catch it (if you don't, you don't)
(if you don't, you don't)

And what you need ironically
will turn out what you want to be
If you just let it (if you don't, you don't)
If you just let it (if you don't, you don't)

See what you want might make you cry
What you need might pass you by
If you don't catch it (if you don't, you don't)
(if you don't, you don't)

And what you need ironically
will turn out what you want to be
If you just let it
If you just let it

When it hurts so bad (when it hurts so bad)
When it hurts so bad (when it hurts so bad)
Why's it feel so good? (when it hurts so bad)
(when it hurts so bad)

When it hurts so bad (when it hurts so bad)
When it hurts so bad (when it hurts so bad)
Why's it feel so good? (when it hurts so bad)
(when it hurts so bad)

When it hurts so bad (when it hurts so bad)
So bad (when it hurts so bad)
(when it hurts so bad)
(when it hurts so bad)</pre>
