[Moochy C]
Fuck if you don't like me
Cats tug 'til you greet 'em with that desert eagle
You don't wanna see my GE all up in that all black Regal
Put holes in you the size of softballs you can see through
I'm like the battle boys in the hood
I ain't got no problem buckin the, gauge out the window
I was O-Dog before "Menace II Society," pistol play regularly
It was like playin dunk cause you owls was afraid for me
I write what I know
Your life ain't shit compared to mine so I can't copy your flow
I got a few loose screws, off my rocker
Infatuated with them block choppers, that'll spark the night
Turn the dark to light, you probably need Blue Blockers
Nigga I know what I'm worth, it's over crown me
Or I'ma take your city like Capone to Chicago
You niggaz better stop, fuckin with me

I know what I'm worth, they ain't fuckin with me
They ain't as real me, they ain't hot enough to spit with me
I know what I'm worth, I'm a demon with the words
Beast in the street, I won't hesitate to put your brains on the curb
I know what I'm worth, now that my big brother gone
I hope you understand, you niggaz got problems on your hands
I know what I'm worth, fuck a deal, you ain't gotta sign me
But a year from now you gon' wish you signed me

You motherfuckers ain't shit nigga
I signed with Gary T, yeah that's right
I still got Self-Explanatory, CJ on his way
Know what I'm sayin, cop Young Boogie album
Know how it go down, need to cop that album Rash
Know what I'm sayin you muh'fuckers gon' feel me from here on out
I'm shuttin down the game nigga
Let's get into it Tone</pre>
