[Fes Taylor]
Yo, new Ferrari, red Lamborghini parked
Neon lights, see it when it's dark
Knight Rider whip, guaranteed a chick strip
Get inside the whip, see if you can ride the stick
Parking lot pimp, Cam Big Silk
Put me on to the game, and I ain't been the same since
You ain't getting no money, it makes no sense
Picture me struggling, hustling to pay the rent
No, record label budget, I just made a flip
So I get as much money as music on the strip
Look at my kicks, and extra diamonds on my wrist
And I hit up Joe Finest on the hip
We doing big things something like a pre-historic
Bottles of Henny I down 'em like an alcholic
I'm the shit, yeah, straight outta the toilet
I'm so fly, I can airport it

[Chorus 2X: Flip (Fes Taylor)]
Check how I ride (I'm just, I'm just, feeling myself)
26's on the tire (I got money, they feeling my wealth)
I gotta stay fly (No help, I did it myself)
To the second that I die (These in my pants, I'm just feeling myself)

[Fes Taylor]
I'm like, mami let's take a flight, and tell your man
He can take a hike, I throw up peace signs at the break light
My cake right, I stay laced right
Nah, no dust on my clothes, I hit the stage like
Glitter and glamour, what up Lounge Lo?
I still, linger with the hammer that was down in Atlanta
Co-sign me, plus I got 50 backing
So haters real mad, my money really stacking
In it like, chill, say I'm overreacting
Regardless of my future, still know me from back then
Nowadays, glide on 'em, G-5 on 'em
They doing boy scout knots, cut ties on 'em
Birthday cake, see I'm bout to rise on 'em
True religion G's, HF designs on 'em
Fly, fresh, fly, fresh, fly, fresh

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
