[Buddha Monk]
It's the Brooklyn Zu, it's the Brooklyn Zu
Let me tell you mother fuckers, it's the Brooklyn Zu
It's the Brooklyn Zu, it's the Brooklyn Zu
Let me tell you mother fuckers, it's the Brooklyn Zu

Yo, I be in this game, the Buddha Monk fuckin up your stamina
Shut your mouth, listen close to this Brooklyn Zu damager
I never seen so many amateurs get awards for wack grammar
But now I got my daily plan on how to act right, think right
Get the subverb on ya, then fuckin ram ya, Ha! It's sickenin
Heard better shit on the radio, but your's the one that's still tickin
It's alright, I'ma come with that wild stack
There's the Brooklyn Zu laid on every track
Try not playin my shit, nigga and you'll catch two to ya back
Yo, I mean that, my style made strictly for the rap, where it was at
Fuck the diamonds, the plush houses and the bitches layin on they stacks
Niggaz, what? Niggaz, what? What? It's the freestyle!

[Poppa Chief]
It's a psycho, so shoot fast on the warpath
Every time I touch a stick of steel, it's a bloodpath
Black licorice, choclate compressed
Super-nigga written across my chest
I'd bet my left nut, plus all of my riches
I won't be the one rockin the bandages and stitches
I jiggle jiggle cuz it itches
A hundred-mile an hour pitches
I love it when the bitches be blowin me kisses
*kissing sound* Right back at you
Spell my mother fuckin name right when you put it on the statue
I'll come back, who ever wanna step to the B-R double O K-L-Y-N Z-U
*radio static* Mother fucker!</pre>
