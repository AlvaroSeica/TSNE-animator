Let's go!
Let's go!

[Verse One]
Momma ain't raise no fool 
True, but me and my brother never made it out school 
She prayed on me passing that bar 
It's way different ma you see I'm' passing out bars 
The definition of a jetsetter 
I'm hip hop still living like a good fella 
Castle and crooks sweater 
And the queen never trip 
She travel way faster than you rook niggas
Have you seen Adiza with beaches that look like Eva with D cups? 
With a beach like an HBO feature at night 
A quarter pound of sand in my unreleased Nikes 
Amsterdam hot, smoke it all by tonight 
Nigga you don't know about the life 
When shit gets heavier than Norbert's wife 
But still gotta spit some enormous rhymes 
Niggas more than like 
And more than likely when you return home you ignored by the gorgeous wife
Cause she feel slighted 
And you don't want to fight with her cause you tired 
But now it's back to the lab 
45 messages right after you land 
Feet feel swollen, you gone from the Zanex 
And this is the life with the mic in your hand

[Chorus] [Wale]
We on a world tour, Wale your man 
Hustlin' each and every ghetto with the mic in my hand 
New York, VA, DC, get paid
We on a world tour, Wale your man 
Hustlin' each and every ghetto with the mic in my hand 
London, Tokyo, we gon' take you all around the globe
Sing to 'em shorty

[Verse Two]
See Jay did Scotland and everybody jocked him 
I did Scotland and got no props for it 
Naw, that just fucked up my jay's 
Which fucked up my day, rock Walley's on stage
Freezing my willy off
No hotel 
I'm back on the plane while they was like, "Go Whale." 
I'm so well ahead of them I'm unpaved 
I did justice to Justice Monfre'
One thing that you niggas must acknowledge
I, beat beats like pants on scottish kilt 
It's how it's dealt 
I've been over more water than than Neo Phelps
It's harder when you by yourself 
My nigga Bun B. good health
My nigga Rhymefest never give about self 
Cause we think about wealth like Fench do milfs 
On American Pie 
It's hard to have American pride 
When most of your money's made out of them lines
The other half is out of them lies
Want to make a nigga like, "Oh fuck." 
Rewind so much that's it's on her
Rewind so much know it's o-ver
Paid 'em and I hate 'em 
But they wrong for it 
D.C. know who cause I'm on first

[Chorus] [Wale]
We on a world tour, Wale your man 
Hustlin' each and every ghetto with the mic in my hand 
New York, VA, DC, get paid
We on a world tour, Wale your man 
Hustlin' each and every ghetto with the mic in my hand 
London, Tokyo, we gon' take you all around the globe
Sing to 'em shorty

[Jasmine Sullivan singing]
Know that we give it, we give it hard
No half steppin' baby this is who we are
Every word, every word, brother from my heart
Spo-spo-spoken from the heart
To get with it
Get with it
Let me see your hands if you feel this

[Chorus] [Wale]
We on a world tour, Wale your man 
Hustlin' each and every ghetto with the mic in my hand 
New York, VA, DC, get paid
We on a world tour, Wale your man 
Hustlin' each and every ghetto with the mic in my hand 
London, Tokyo, we gon' take you all around the globe
Sing to 'em shorty</pre>
