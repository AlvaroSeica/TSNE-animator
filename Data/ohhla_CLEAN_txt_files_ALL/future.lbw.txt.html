Song:   I'm The Future
Typed by: KeeHooper3@aol.com

I'm off the chains
I'm off the chains
Yeah I'm off the chains

[Chorus:]
Have you ever seen me,I'm the future
I represent how it's gone be, I'm the future
Born in 1987, I'm the future
Party people get ready, it's the future 
I dont know about y'all
But I know about me
And when I think about the future 
I'm all you see
Cuz I am the future

(Bow Wow)
I'm somethin your not 
I'm just right with the block
Every jam that I make
Gotta go knock, knock
The biggest thang since hugo
You know y'all cats do a whole lot do mo believe me
I'm loose now running at full speed
Like the juice now like back in '73'
Ya heard of me 
Had to I'm that lil bad dude
With JD
I'm the A in the hit 
I'm the prince of the click
What you think keep makin shorty have them fits
It's the b capital O-W Wow
Like Moe Dee how you like me now
Tryna do it real big like Chris an nem 
But if this thing dont work i'm above the rim
Between the legs and behind the back
Yeah i'm small but I got that
Now tell me

Chorus

(R.O.C.)
Now look up ahead dats me
Far beyond the flow is gone come on
You know the kid is crazy 
Like Britney Spears 
And I'm in the prime of my years    oh yeah
I know what pops up in ya head first is ( wait a minute)
How he keep coming up with verses ( uh huh)
Well i'm gonna tell ya something and don't get nervous ( allright)
My secret is I'm doing this on purpose( Why)
To get a billion copies purchased
If your style is sick (well) 
Mine is allergic
My rhymes in the beat merges like interstate traffic(ooh mybad)
It's just a habit
I flows it
I know it'll probably illegal
Before the o's before you
Even close to being the COR
Even backwards I'm hard 
And I give my regards
But I aint rapping with y'all
I'm a year after tomorrow

You can't see me 
I'm the future
I represent how it's gone be
I'm the future
Born in '79'
I'm the future
Party people get ready
It's the future </pre>
