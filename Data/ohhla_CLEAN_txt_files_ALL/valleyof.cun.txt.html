Now I seen obscene times before this hip-hop game came
Like the cops that checked me, left me a 'mate
to a system of Gingerbread Men on top overpaid
Put to work in a 3rd floor bucket, quarter a day
Choppin' down trees so the next prison is made
They separate us from slaves for thirty dollars of pay
The jailor got a tailor and an F250
Standin' on Dirty Acres feelin' gotdamn filthy
Natti stands for his, suckers crawl for others
Understand the biz, I suffocate undercovers
'Cause somebody gets paid, our lemons are simply beginnings
My sweat been the sugar in some cracker's lemonade
Got my brother in Baghdad, hands clenchin' grenades
While we hustle like house niggas, try'na buy chains
Back asswards for try'na buy change
I'mma walk through the Valley and rally through my pains, nigga
I'mma wear your confederate flag and be a rebel
Burn this bitch down, rebel with heavy metal
?? for pissin' on our hopes and our dreams
Since I's a youth seen it, seen it like they broke in my dreams
Weave it together, I need all the yarn you can swing
From filthy farms we learned about what type alarm you can ring
Are you gon' listen?  It seems the only sense you got is vision
And since we shed our senses now the sense is steady slippin'
And since we stopped our youth from prayin' senselessness is livin' 
And the rich don't really give a fuck 'cause they don't gotta live it
I see hard livin' e'ryday, you never payed a visit
To ya'll the 'hood's a museum, in truth we just exibits
In truth we just some digits, a means to an end
By any means so ??? why we won't win
Since ya'll don't wanna listen, all the youth's pissed and placed in my pen
So then maybe all this shit'll see an end
 
[Hook]
Dwell in the Valley of Death, fell in ???
Into the mountain top where streets are paved in gold
But I know "Only God can put out hot flame, until then we gon' face our pain"
And I know "Only God can put out our flame
until then we gon' stake our claim, on these Dirty Acres"</pre>
