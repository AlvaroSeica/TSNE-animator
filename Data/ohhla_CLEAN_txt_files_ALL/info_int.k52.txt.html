Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Tired of those CD's that don't leave you fufilled
Come on down to KJ-52! Thats right! It's Funky!
Well don't take our word for it!
Listen to our sponser the Kleesder!

Thats right it slices it dices it makes these .....[?] Ha Ha ha Ha!

But don't take our word for it, ask these satisfied customers!

I used to be a cross eyed bowlegged one-armed safety patrolman
but since listening to KJ-52 I've since elevated myself to crossing guard
Thank tou KJ!

Hey no problem that's what we're here for
Well come on down to KJ-52
If you act now well throw in a mullenator!
That's right, it'll give yourself a mull haircut
before you even know what happened! So come on down
Act now while supplies are limited

KJ-52 is not responsible for animal attacks
based on the mull haircut thank you</pre>
