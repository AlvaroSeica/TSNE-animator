[Chorus 2X: L.I.S. w/ Toccara harmonzing]
I'm makin' a, unexpected hit on a Sunday
And just left the bar with strippers on a runway
The feds knocked by man for dealin' too much gunplay
You said who did what? I don't say it

[L.I.S.]
I got ounces on my brain from stressin' my life
And every chance that I get, I'm caressin' the mic
I'm at my best to fight, with a scuffed pair of Nikes
If it ain't rough, it ain't right, I'm a Warrior for life
Tell a story, I just might, put this truth to the mic
Like Sabretooth when I write, call me the Bonecrusher
And I leak a muster, all my Arab mothafuckas
I don't throw combos, I throw clusters
Lyrical abductor, spiritual erupter
What the fuck did you put in that Dutch?
It look like haze but you could smell it's a bluff
Enough, live and survivin' here, await you
I'll tell them bitches won the bar, Daddy'll take two

[Chorus 2X]

[Lon Dini]
We flip big eighths, all my sons stay with a case
I'm highly manage, stay on my feet, fly and cheddar chase
Ask the fiends who got the fat bags of rawest base
They say coke cook marvelous, they took it to the face
All my nigs pop bubble like we never heard of money trouble
Hustle and plug you, and we still respect the struggle
Got styles that can't be cramped, life ain't stamped
'Til we all pushin' Bentleys down Rembrandt
Where a man chants, somewhere off the coast of San Fran
Might ask how in closed minds be so advanced
Been so real, just like I held it in my hand
Click stay live, Fes copped the black new 4-5
L.I. 'bout to come with Daddy L.S.
Tell 'em bitches "Yo let's head for the door, ain't nothin' left"

[L.I.S.]
I make hits for fun, spit like clips from guns
Then split like the jeans on my big booty hun
I'm the one, son of Morpheus, of course it's L.I.S.
Never fuck with that flossy shit, keep me a bossy bitch
Never get my crosses crisp, flow with nauseusness
Gil got the Porsche with the spoiler kit
I done crossed the state border with a ball of shit
Slang all of it and ball out with this ballin' bitch
She liked to gargle on my balls and shit
And she carry my 4-4 with bulldogs in the clip
Cuz I'm always the shit and she keeps me in guns
Got me kickin' down the door, don't nobody run

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
