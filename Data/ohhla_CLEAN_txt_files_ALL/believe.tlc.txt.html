[Intro]
This Jam is dedicated to Moi
That's right you guys
Just For.....
 
[Chorus: Left Eye]
Me
I believe in me
Cause I take care of me
Took so long to see
All I really need is me
Faith and family
Finally made me see
No matter what I think
All I need is me
 
[Verse 1: Left Eye]
Everybody says they know me better than I know myself
But I don't know nobody else that felt what I felt
Did what I did, or been where I been
But, had to defend myself again and again
Let it in where it begins, who cares what the cause is
Too many bosses cost a bore, and I don't take offers well
I play with the team, but I am Diana Ross, and not a Supreme
You think you got me all figured out
So the only solid thing is trying to get a bigger house?
No, part of my need is a company
So I can hire out my own people to live out their own dreams
So tell me, what's happenin to all yall people with low self esteem
What, what, what,  you want me to cry on your shoulder
So you can turn around and laugh and talk about it when it's over?
 
[Chorus: Left Eye]
Me
I believe in me
Cause I take care of me
Took so long to see
All I really need is me
Faith and family
Finally made me see
No matter what I think
All I need is me
 
[Verse 2: Left Eye]
I ignored 30 mil, dates to making money
When it got too convenient, I just gave it up
I don't need the stress, I don't need the pain
I do need the checks, but don't need the game
Oh my how could him and I, be the same
When the house burnt down, only I took the blame
When the money ain't got funny, I predicted court
What most of yall dwell, wouldn't even thought
When the group had issues, I layed in the thought
I corrected the bad news, I heard in intervers
Tell me do you really know lisa, not many
It's not contrary to fear, I don't know you either
I'm more responsible for more, than you will ever see
So many things you don't know, happen because of me
I'm black to the design, to the state, that was me
So how may of y'all will laugh at me
 
[Chorus: Left Eye]
Me
I believe in me
Cause I take care of me
Took so long to see
All I really need is me
Faith and family
Finally made me see
No matter what I think
All I need is me
 
[Verse 3: Left Eye]
Everybody says all they want the truth
Well the truth is that I still got love for my group
But you don't really want the truth when it's concerning you
You want to hear that no one is doing better than you
You love to hear the pain, you love to hear the struggle
You love to know that paradise, has got trouble
The only trouble we ever had is you being around
Do not get involved, where you do not belong
When my faith started to waver, I feltwas like I was done
I felt like Brian McKnight, I was back at one
The only one that was, the only one and ever
The only one I need, the one and only me
Because if I ever told you it was all on a different plane
You would think that I meant our flights ain't the same
My my crime is that I was so blind
Didn't know I had everything that I wanted all the time
 
[Chorus: Left Eye 4x]
Me
I believe in me
Cause I take care of me
Took so long to see
All I really need is me
Faith and family
Finally made me see
No matter what I think
All I need is me</pre>
