[Intro]
Alright.. Hahaha!
Yeah, show these niggaz what it is
Rock, to the beat (Ha ha)
Bump, Knux, in the booth, rockin
Yo..

[Bumpy Knuckles]
These niggaz wanna be me, huh, life real
with a no-end policy and, mic skills
I feel like when I'm, on-stage then I'm
Bumpy Obama with bars that I pen out
Before I get out, I spit out the pain
That I been through the last twenty years (word)
Change amongst hip-hop peers, I got eyes, I got ears
I ain't dumb, where I'm from, loyalty is rare
And that's fair in the ghetto 
Like street ball double dribble
Like walls of graffitti scribble
Like c-lo triples, back to back
Over Preemo, I got it and mashed the packs
And everyday we hustlin, grindin
Watchin old niggaz we fed side-windin
I draw a fine line, if you cross it, B
Over ya head in the casket where the cross'll be, word up!

[Chorus: Bumpy Knuckles] (DJ Premier cuts and scratches)
I'm tryin to take it.. (take it...)
Take it to the top
 ("Whatcha game be like?"
