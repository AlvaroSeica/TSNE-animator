"A new day's dawnin" {*Scratched by DJ Bonez*}

[Hook] {X2}
Tomorrow is another today
But there ain't no other today

[Verse 1: Muph]
Ok, huh, I won't waste away
Waiting for that superhero to save the day
Ok, eventually waste away
But today bringin broke like Rogaine, there's no way
To escape the blame, they disposed of the faith
And it won't be their only mistake
I've got an open range like Werribee
Make amends with friends that ended up enemies
With a tendency to put things off
Mind back and forth, ball in ping-pong
We don't live long so I'ma sing along
To the sounds of that dial tone, today's a milestone
See it's been awhile since we last spoke
Pick up the phone, callin to let you know
I've got hope in the spokes of those trainin wheels
Overcoat, overdosed but the paint will peel

[Hook] {X2}

[Verse 2: Raph Boogie]
Is there time tomorrow to do what I'm sposed ta
do today? Can I put that off?
Can I make my way without feelin lost?
Or do I gotta get it done at any cost?
The option is self-inflicted
When the foresight can't be immediately given
And the stakes have risen while the pain is creepin
But I keep goin, deny the sleepin
And I know, that with rest comes clarity
But the checklist keeps messin with my sanity
How can it be pilin up?
And then I look to myself like "smarten up"
Yeah, and be the father that I am
Turn off that box son and put a book in your hand
And get my game together
Rain, hail or sun, can't blame no weather

[Verse 3: Eligh]
Today's the day I make my way, I make my voice so loud so crowds
Overseas hear me, near me got mine, got reach, got speech
No judgement punch and flow control, adios, out of all complex context
In touch with your - innermost side, emotional ocean
Leavin you open, got my toes in undertow, unavailable
Won't drag you under like many men who got drugged, under the rug
Makin those mean mugs wanna be thugs, wanna beef up, what?
I'm not the one today, not the one to say shit
When you're fallin fast like a brick, and I'm ballin past in my whip
I'm not that there so much and so then therefore I'ma straight on earth, I'm here to live
Just for today, just to say "bring this beef" on earth
There's so much worth and there's so much work and you got me churpin rhymes
Bring you down to the dirt, downtown when the frown prints on the outskirts of the streetlights
I'ma be right here, livin for today
With no fear, livin for today
Tomorrow's not here and yesterday's gone
I'm here for today and I'll see you on the other side

[Hook] {X2}

[Verse 4: The Grouch]
Well I can't put it off, I put it on, tell me when ta
Still get it done though I'm gone till November
Reborn in the mornin, die every evenin
Come back fresh from more pressure, no grievin
I use my mind like a medicine, chess
I'm a legend and I'm living a veteran, yes
Today I haven't thought about somethin they forgot about
Bein myself, the conscious brought it out
Tomorrow brings what sorrow sings so
I won't cry over things that dry up
What it is is what it is, not what it was
It's all love, blood in
Blood out, you in the dug out then butt out
I'm in the field, eatin what the crops yield
That's if the soil's certified organic
Because I'm royalty on this planet

[Hook] {X2}

[Verse 5: The Tongue]
Aiyyo, I wrote this verse on Thursday the 5th
Cause I wasn't sure who I'd be by Friday the 6th
See my mind state is sick, rhymes bleed out the ear
If it's midnight on Pluto, what day is it here?
See time tames the fear, makes you feel immortal
You're fifty in a flash, years lost to the black hole
Where does your youth go? Ain't there a loophole?
Can't somebody tell me, where is the truth sold?
I once was a new soul now I'm so dusty
Just trusted my watch, slave to the swatch
Not a moment to waste when you're alone in the race
Tonight's your last supper, put plenty on the plate bitch
I got them old school skills, back to basics
Emcee and microphone, lyrics and no patience
You Play Stations, we get played on stations
Did the hard yards yesterday, tomorrow gonna take this
