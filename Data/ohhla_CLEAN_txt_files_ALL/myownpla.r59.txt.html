[Royce Da 5'9"]
Uhh, right off the rip nobody could fuck with me
I'm out of space, mind and body, my soul and so on (so on)
Mami I'm fly is an understatement
Come to greatness

[Chorus: Mr. Porter - singing]
I'm on my own planet, I'll do my own thing
Then turn around and pat myself on the back, for doin good
I don't need nobody else, I'm gon' do it by myself
Say what you wanna say but stick to the facts, it's all good
It's all good

[Royce Da 5'9"]
Right off the rip nobody is quite like me
You gon' need a NASA spacecraft to sight me
If you don't like me bite me
I could give a fuck-less, fightin excites me
Leanin on the moon with a Patr√≥n fifth playin my own shit
And I sound terrific
I'm not cocky, I'm beyond that
It's time to start another hobby, I'm beyond rap
Run and tell your baby daddy and your son Ray
I'm hot, I sunbathe on the sun babe
I'm the one on the one-way
Head from pretty long legs from the runway
My nigga Notty is a genius
You gon' need a ladder just to climb on my penis
Got two words for the rap game
Fuck y'all!

[Chorus]

[Royce Da 5'9"]
Right off the rip you thought it was a wrap for me
Didn't you? Go on 'head and admit it hater
Cold as ice, I'm a livin refrigerator
The reason hip-hop's breathin the defibrillator
I did a bid just for drunk drivin
It never happen again cause now I'm drunk flyin
I'm a innovator
When I say I'm on Venus I don't mean that I'm datin the tennis player
I'm on Saturn where you don't matter
Alone, I'm past the zone where your phone scatters
(Hello?) Can you hear me now?
You don't got a fuckin choice
I elbowed my way into e'rybody conversations
with rhymin, timin and patience, now I'm in space bitch
I used to have to be on some "watch what I say" shit
But now you gotta TAKE IT!

[Chorus]

[Joe Budden]
They, say a closed mouth don't get fed
I say a closed mouth don't give head
On the flipside know a closed fist don't get bread
And if you swing it then you gon' get lead
Bars put him in a panic, got him all frantic
Overlook my antics, see that I'm a throwback, hip-hop's Stan Smith
But it lessen my love
Cause the so-called rulers, ain't quite measurin up
Now let me give the chicks a message
Bitter exes'll tell you that the dick is precious
Three words: "Get over it"
And if you speak mine mention I could trip over it
Low-key like my name too big for the bill
Betty White style, get it in, STILL
Plus I'm on a high you can't fit in the pill
But I'll try anyway, we gon' die anyway
Ya heard?

[Chorus]</pre>
