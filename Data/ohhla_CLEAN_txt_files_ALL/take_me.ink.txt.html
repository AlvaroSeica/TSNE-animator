Song:   Take Me Down
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I'm on a first class flight headed through the clouds
And you can never take me down, take me down, take me down

You can never take me down
I came too far for you to break me down now
It ain't even the same since you found out
Shit be getting dirtier than down south
Mo money mo problems big said it
Trying not to let this fame get me big headed
They say I'm luckier than 6 7
Tryin' to tell you motherfuckers than this shit's destined
And I can live me life
I know its hard for you to see me through the limelight
And you can't even tell me why you mad
Madder than the hatter always saying something bad
Tell me does it shock you to see me
Cause these people paid a lot to come see me
Never change like a hospital tv
Cause they smoking like the top of a teepee

I'm on a first class flight headed through the clouds
And you can never take me down, take me down, take me down

No, this is everything I coulda did more
But tell me what I gotta front for
Can't knock my hustle like a front door
You can't touch me like the front room
You know when I spit its like a monsoon
Somebody call 911
Swear they gonna need a stretcher when I'm done
Money money money only money on my mind
Four chains make it sunny all the time
If I get out of line, please don't blame me
I'm only an example of what the world made me
So drinks up till I'm six down
Somebody roll up I need a hit now
I said judy couldn't judge me
So high baby, ain't nobody above me

I'm on a first class flight headed through the clouds
And you can never take me down, take me down, take me down</pre>
