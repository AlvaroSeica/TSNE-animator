Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
You're the only one you make my life complete
if I was ever to loose you I'd be loosing everything
You're the only one you make my life complete
if I was ever to loose you I'd be loosing everything

[Verse 1]
I think the day that I met you heaven opened up the skies
And sent me an angel to change my life
Cause ever since that day I ain't never been the same
Juss to stand next to you is like a rush for me
I still remember one cold night when I confessed
And I would go krazie juss to have one kiss
The more that I see you the more you penetrate
My soul with your eyes dreamin everynight
Wut my days would be like if I could luvv you forever
To hear your pretty voice say that we belong together
Maybe to have you is like a million to one
But the truth is to me girl

[Chorus]
You're the only one you make my life complete
if I was ever to loose you I'd be loosing everything
You're the only one you make my life complete
if I was ever to loose you {I told you I never wanna loose you girl}
I'd be loosing everything

[Verse 2]
I never wanna make you cry girl keep that on your mind
When you need somebody more than juss a friend I'm on your side
To hold you close when your nights get cold
To remind you everyday that your so beautiful
I know that sometimes life is juss not fair
So when it rains in your heart I'm a be right there
You see life is short and every minute that pass
Is a moment gone forever and it's never comin bakk
It's kinda krazie how time has a way
Of making all these memories juss fade away
So if there's juss one thing that you remember bout me
Remember that I luvv you unconditionally

[Chorus]
You're the only one you make my life complete
if I was ever to loose you I'd be loosing everything
You're the only one you make my life complete
if I was ever to loose you I'd be loosing everything</pre>
