[Ring Leader]
Aww, little baby bitch ass is crying again, what's the matter?
Feeling like you don't fit in anywhere?
What about fitting that ass in with us, the mighty Deezy Cizzarn?
We'll fucking gladly take you
We take all shapes, colors, sizes, and genders!
We are the mighty, mystical, mythological
dark motherfucking carnival, byatch!

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
I see you feeling lonely again, you's a mother fucker
Feeling like you don't belong, like you the only other?
Some of us scrubs got it worse than you
Some of us scrubs got it worse than you
No homies to call on, or crew to belong too
Some of us said fuck all that bullshit and dropped out
Some of us stood up to fight but got knocked out
Some of us like to cuss and don't like your format
We like the wicked shit and chose not to ignore that

[Violent J]
Some of us be coming out of more than a broken home

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
Some of us be living out of our cars and carry on
Some of us see the Budget Suites as a real apartment
And make you take off your shoes on our carpet
Some of us are on parole and can't leave the state
And some are dead and gone, my homie Blaze can relate
And some can't afford a free phone call

[Violent J]
But then some of us's equal us all, think about that

[Chorus]
We Belong! We the shit. We Belong! We the shit
We Belong! Our carnival is here!
We Belong! We the shit. We Belong! Come as you are
We Belong! Find Us Everywhere!

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
Some of us own dope cars that fail to exist
Some of us have profiles nobody else fits
And some ain't got time for the Monks in Tibet
Because my own kids are hungry and they're looking to me for shit

[Violent J]
Some of us own drug paraphenalia materials
and some of us have incurable sexual venereals
And some of us have dreams of being a star

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
And most won't make it that far, but it's all good
Some of us can't afford the coolest shoes
Some of us give a fuck what popularity choose
Some bitches tittie dance because their babies are crying
Others say they're dancing for college, you know that they're lying
Some of us are in love with people who ain't ours
Some of us don't give up until we're behind bars
And some of us must of been born to take the fall

[Violent J]
But then some of us's euqal us all

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
And I'm with you

[Chorus]</pre>
