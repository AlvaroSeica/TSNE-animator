(*talking*)
This for everybody who ever been in love
No matter how hard you try to act, we all walk in them shoes
Once it was gone, you had to figure a way out

[K-Rino]
I use to think meeting somebody like you, was impossible
But five minutes of time, led me to needing lots of you
Didn't really know what to expect, once I met with you
How was it so easy, to automatically connect with you
Kept it true with you, your conversation was helping me
Even though you knew my discrepancies, you accepted me
Wondered could you and me ever be, it was just crazy
Physically was miles apart, mentally we touched daily
Compatibility, and chemistry was real again
It was a hole in my life, and you filled it in
The more I talked to you, the more I was feeling the distance
Actually cared about my thoughts, and was willing to listen
Felt something, from the moment that I seen her
Everything was perfect on her, from her looks to her demeanor
Even though I wasn't with you, I was no longer alone
Can't believe I found a person like you, but now I'm tripping cause she's

[Chorus]
Gone away everything we had, everything we ever did just
Gone away, use to be happy that you was in my life now everyday's a
Lonely day, nothing is the same since the day I realized that you was
Gone away...

[K-Rino]
Whenever a new day would begin
I'd hear your voice, and I'd be like a seventh grader again
Now I'm out of the picture, I wish that I could come get ya
I miss jumping in, and riding shotgun with ya
No fussing and arguing, just having a blast
You gave me the piece of mind, I never had in the past
It was hard when you use to ask, if we'd ever be permanent
But my situation, was too complex to determine it
And even though, our situations was throwed
Through the duration, I was grateful for the patience you showed
Every minute spent together, was consistently good
You use to say let's run away, I'd say I wish that we could
And I really did, but somehow when we begun
For you to walk out of my life, I knew that moment would come
And believe me, I understand cause no one in their right mind
Would wait a whole lifetime, now I'm tripping cause she's

[Chorus]

[K-Rino]
Feeling bad cause I'm wrong, hard to leave us alone
Missing you when we apart, thinking bout that Usher song
When you said you love me, I wondered when will it dissolve
Expectations change, once you get feelings involved
I'm locked in, still certain questions popped in
If we so happy together, how come we not then
Both of us did things, that cause the other pain
Still it's hard to picture you, driving in another lane
I know it's selfish, but losing you ain't optional
The feelings that I got for you, is friendship even possible
I guess it is, cause even after we stall
I'd rather have you as a friend, than not have you at all
And over time, we can let it go and be fine
Deep down I kinda knew, you wasn't totally mine
And I wasn't totally yours, so you did what you felt you had to do
Now I gotta move on minus you, cause ya

[Chorus]

[K-Rino]
Maybe in another time, another place
Maybe in another time, another place
Another dimension, another space
I can see your lovely face</pre>
