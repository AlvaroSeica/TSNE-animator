[Intro: Tech N9ne]
Hahahaha, in the world of BET
I'm looked at as too rock n roll
In the world of MTV
My name is too gangsta huh, hahaha
Man, Stragne Music we got this baby
This year we got this one baby
Red hair, red everything
It's Tech N9ne baby like it or not

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Never been a harder rhymer in my region globally
that's holdin me I'm totally hard and bossed up
Why you think the majority of the rap musical authority
sword me and barred and crossed up
Cause they don't wanna let the crazy kid in then
Spit his hymns speakin a grim religion
of rhyme, forbidden my isms are hidden
My mind, to written then spittin' the kid in
The N9ne, is playin you, slayin you, sprayin you
Permanently delayin you, swayin through, it's the gay in you
that's hatin who, something's that hella beyond us
(I love Kanye, his shit is bombay, but I'm rough)
And you can see it in my retina
That I won't be lettin' ya
Threatinas better respect Tech the messengas
Too dope on this to be
History listen this is a mystery
While they spittin' and dissin' me

[Hook: Tech N9ne &amp; Big Krizz Kalico]
This is me (this is me)
I'm a king, I'm a klown, I'm a G (I'm a G)
I believe what I want
Got you singin' my song
But your seein' me wrong
So what's a matter with me?
This is the belief (the belief)
The religion has arisin' from the deep (from the deep)
Darkest prison if you listen you will see (you will see)
If colision your decision you will reep what you so forget what you know this is me

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
This is Tech bra
For years I've been the next to collect a plethra of checks lets get extra
Is what I set ta
Travis let's go select the baddest rappers infect the planet leave 'em in exta
See I'm a vet the powers don't really wanna let the best
come and wreck the sets and test your sector
Instead of rawness like Inspecta Deckta
Eldest rather set they specs on Mason Betha
Slept on my records
If you knew my music's Hannibal lector
What the hell you callin' Funkmaster Flex for?
Don't pester me I won't sweet you be on a quest to
Investagate your techma respect the
Shockra tease in hop to these
Hot degrees me and Mr. O Apostrophe
Never listen to these pop-asees cause they suck!
(I love 50 Cent he gritty went he vent but I'm rough)
And you can see it in my demeanor
The Tecca Nina will blast arenas
The grass is greana
Made it ma to the top of the world
Kiss me, miss me (This Is Me)
Can't you see?

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
The industry treat me like a ride on the short bus
Thats why I'm tellin' they youngstas when your retourt cuss
And make a fort fuss
Cause you went out on Sam Goody on F.Y.E. with they money and you support us
Strangas, Shadys, Psychopaths and Juggalos
Loseas, Shootas, College women and gutta hoes
Rock it from prescios doe
Drops it just lets it flow
Cop it don't knock it you block us stop at the record store
This is Aaron Yates, this Aaliyah in rain
This is for little Donnie this is for all Lacoya's pain
This is, for the sickness of Marty Sue
This is for all the love of Sara, Suzy, Ira Mae, and Izeta Lou
This is for Ike and Ricky
Rufus, Rhonda, Barbara, and Marla really
This is for B'zle and I know that rest of my family is with me
This is my friends, this is the end, this is a G
This is life, this is worng, this right, this is me
