Thurro Chorus
 
Love me unconditional, unconditionally
And our love will be eternal, eternity
for the next life, and the next life, and the next life
 
Jas Mace Verse
 
Even though we just met, the little time that we spent
Felt so intimate like it was all meant to be
And we were together for centuries
Maybe in my previous life you were my wife
And I was your man we probably walked holding hands
Under Sakura trees as we enjoyed the hanami
Felt the breeze moving the trees
Worry free, because I had a good girl and she was right there beside me
Now you can call it destiny
But there's something out there that brought you back to me
And put you back in my arms, so close but so far
I like to think before you sleep we look up at the same stars
And if it falls you close your eyes and make a wish
That you and I would be together forever just like this
But these feelings won't switch because this
Is like a gift from the past that out last any physical
Yeah it's something like a miracle
When two souls are reunited in the spiritual
And you ain't even have to say it
Because these feelings are so strong that no words can explain it
Yeah, and now I'm tired of waiting
Getting pushed to my limits I done ran out of patience
The karma we share keeps us united
Because you're my soul mate, a love that's reincarnated
 
Thurro Chorus
 
Love me unconditional, unconditionally
And our love will be eternal, eternity
for the next life, and the next life, and the next life
 
Jas Mace Verse
 
From the first time I saw your face
I knew you were purposely put in place to be beside Jas
And to think it all started with an innocent smile
I never thought that it would go this far but here we are
You and I intertwined since the beginning of time
We could have been partners in crime, my Bonnie to Clyde
And the first sign, was when you went to the shrine
And asked the heavens above to give you someone that you couldn't find
A man that could love you right
Then two weeks later we were talking all night
It's like I knew you my whole life
And we ain't even talk but twice, but that's alright though
Because the feelings are so pure
And the conversations were more like reminiscing
Talking about our first kiss and wishing
We could be together making love throughout the stormy weather
Because never in this life did I think that I would find you
It's like a fairy tale come true
And we both knew this was something different
A connection that we couldn't explain it's not the same
As our previous relationships it's much deeper
It couldn't be any realer
Because probably in my past life you were like my princess
My hime, my love, the only one I thought of
 
Thurro Chorus
 
Love me unconditional, unconditionally
And our love will be eternal, eternity
for the next life, and the next life, and the next life
Love me unconditional, unconditionally
And our love will be eternal, eternity
for the next life, and the next life, and the next life</pre>
