Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro: Takeoff]
Aye Migos, man they say y'all made a milli off Versace man, that true?
(That's a fact)
They say young rich niggas man went global all on the net man?
(That's a fact)
So you mean to tell me y'all niggas been had money before this rap shit, this ain't even nothing new man?
(That's a FACT!)
C'mon man check the resume. Migos been out here doin' that shit, fuck nigga
Know what I'm saying, the critics said this, they writing that, it's facts they writing though, feel me

[Chorus x2: Takeoff]
They say you made a milli off Versace, that's a fact
They say before this rap shit you been had a check
They the young rich nigga went with global on the net
You niggas sound just like amigo, that's my lingo, that's a fact

[Verse 1: Takeoff]
You say that there's a new flow in the game then that's a fact
Niggas be like Takeoff you done blew up like I might be fat
Ain't no vacation in this rap 'til I see twenty platinum plaques
On the block like I might be Shaq
Bought a spauldings just check my stats
Walk in Saks with a sack
I'm fuckin' up the economy like Eddie Crack
Made a mil off Versace, independent, how you do that
Caught investing in yourself with M&amp;Ms, nigga
Made a milli but don't think we don't got M&amp;Ms

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 2: Offset]
You niggas be talkin' you niggas be rappin'
That shit that you sayin' is not no fact
Back in the day I used to juug flats
My family proud of me no Kyla Pratt. Kyla Pratt
Stomp a nigga out like I'm in a frat
You gnat gnats bother me like a gnat
Hood bitch different color her tracks
Cookin' up chickens the babies just hatched
Fell in love with the lean I'm attached
I'm fresh and I'm dabbin', not talkin' bout wax
Fat blunts like a Louisville bat
I need all my money not takin' no slack
When you talk to a boss take off your hat
Break in these houses, free my nigga Mac
Bitches go both ways like Da Brat
You say not smokin' I make you relapse

[Chorus x2]</pre>
