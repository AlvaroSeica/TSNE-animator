[Kingpin Skinny Pimp]  
Time for me to run and grab my guns and blast assassin
without no doubt I'm comin with ?
hit ya like Hurrican George in the Carribean
I'm all about my fuckin grass when I'm makin decisions
anybody throwin sneaky faces I'ma smile at
anybody throwin fake smiles I'ma growl at
comin like the ready leaders when I frown at ya mug
automatic raid is bug treatment for you bugs
thinkin about my meal like the CBS Marketwatch
New York Times and Houston Chronicles
watch how quick we hit the top
commercial appeal and L.A. Times
I'm throwin Triple Six down
watchin for them Bone Thugs when I'm drillin they hometown
I was kickin in Cleveland 
in the last winter season
even when I was in Maryland I left that bitch breedin
Crips,Bloods,Folks,Lords I'm claimin give me some
if you split somebody doing business then we makin some
  
<chorus> (2x)
48 hours overtime or so for the cowards
run up we run up
the haters they hate us
know they can't fade us
runnin with the majors
gut-like razors 
I'm fuckin with the real uncut
2000 toke game niggas like what
this is for the dope boys and the dope girls
all around the world
turn it on up
what
  
[Koopsta Knicca]
The time is start tickin and in fear they drop they bud
don't need to duck, dodge, and run
cuz I'm on ya like a sud, bitch
fuck that stealin from me man is gon be fatal
when I point these pistols I buck ya like a third grader
play no games with ya boy 
pay up or get destroyed
run up on ya boys
kill your daughter, son, and they toys
abort the mission
hell nah, I ain't bullshittin
Koop gon let the nine get ya
rip you, kick you punk, and flip you
then get the handle cocked pull it back but first
I'll ? the dead stab yo mom in the pussy blow gushy gushy gushy
  
<chorus>
  
[Kingpin Skinny Pimp]
I'm livin that wildlife sayin that fuckin eye for an eye
every second counts
if you blink you can die (too late)
would you kill for your freedom in society
or would you let a cocksucker put you beneath that concrete
science of the unsolved mysteries
I'm tellin ya
this shit is finna (gonna) get drastic 
we watchin for assassins
harassin and blastin
closed casket, what
we trashin
then we mashin
in the '72 Impala Chevy
tearin up the block like it's a Lexus
  
fatigues on my face
I bet you ain't know who I be
aka the bodysnatcher
blood stainin my enemies
don't be the first to get taken to get baptised
in the bloody bound Bombsquad analyze
recognize we be packin out the house nigga
M.A.F. cracked at top
so bring it nigga
you want war?
you got war
what you waitin for?
hit me up
nigga, show me what you dying for
  
<chorus> (2x)
