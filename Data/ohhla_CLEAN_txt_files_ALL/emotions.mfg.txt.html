Who will survive in World War III? (None!)
Who got a style that come close to me? (None!)
Niggas screaming "battle", who step to me? (None!)
To all you fakers, it's time to meet your maker
My brain's a freeway broken up to intersections
Ambidextrous into music, also into drug connections
In the industry and the streets, I am the man
Take royalties by these kis, that's 6000 grams
Now Grimm Reap's legit, so I don't drip or hit them off
To my murder buddies, then I let them flip it
You can tell my crew by their shoes, we wear ostrich
No lizards, diamonds on our neck and pack a baby Desert
Rappers think they all that and want to go to war
Fuck him, his crew, and everything they stand for
I'm the black Ted Turner, street money earner
United States flag burner
Battling me is some deadly shit
So come equipped with rhymes, guns and two extra clips
Aim for the head, 'cause you don't wear a vest there
Bullet makes a window, your brain needing fresh air
Manhattan's evilest mind, platinum turnout
Before a nigga beat me, please, the Sun'll burn out
Trapped on a planet of pain and perpetrators
That you call Earth but I call Hell's Equator
So it's gonna be a long night
'Cause I'll fuck shit up like Carrie did the prom night
Leaving out the drug game and enter rap on the top

[O.C. sample from "Time's Up"]
"The more emotion I put into it, the harder I rock"
"The more emotion I put into it, the harder I rock"
"The more emotion I put into it, the harder I rock"
"The more emotion I put into it, the harder I rock"
"The more emotion I put into it, the harder I rock"

Who will survive in World War III? (None!)
Who got a style that come close to me? (None!)
Niggas screaming "battle", who step to me? (None!)
To all you fakers, it's time to meet your maker
From the streets, I got mental war scars
Back in the days, I used to want to be a Juice Crew All-Star
But yo, my dream didn't fade, now me touching the mic
Is like the Knicks getting Jordan on a trade
One represents for the scramblers and money-handlers
The type of shit that goes on in the streets is scandalous
I'm from Northside Jamaica, the money-raker
I'm trying to get it up so I can buy an acre
It's the ill nigga One and where I'm from, shit is real
Guzzling ale, waiting for the next sale
Sometimes shots are fired, fiends are wired
Sending decoy buyers 'cause they always want to try us
I'm from right next door so I'm your neighbor
With rusty razors, 800 pagers and other assorted flavors
It's a Queens thing, I love the money the fiends bring
Then jet to the strip joint to see the freaks in the g-string
I got connects in Queens to Manhattan, pockets stay fat
And niggas ratting, mics get laced like satin
Taxes I'm evading in my quest to get paid, to God I pray
Then blew him with the rusty tip of my blade
'Cause I'm stressed, but with the gift of poetry
I been blessed, so I never give the paper and the ink rest
Leaving out the drug game to enter rap on the top

"The more emotion I put into it, the harder I rock"
"The more emotion I put into it, the harder I rock"
"The more emotion I put into it, the harder I rock"
"The more emotion I put into it, the harder I rock"
"The more emotion I put into it, the harder I rock"
"The more emotion I put into it, the harder I rock"
"The more emotion I put into it, the harder I rock"
"The more emotion I put into it, the harder I rock"
"The more emotion I put into it, the harder I rock"

There's only one way to go out, and that's with a bang
It's a fucked up world so I do fucked up things, and I'm
Born angry, I won't die nice, the black Vincent Price
Preserve my brain with Einstein's on dry ice
Conflicters think the pain contract boa constricters
That appetite devour humans in sight like Lector
Battle of the flow of the maniacs, but the maniacs
Lack the bigger brain I pack and plus they flow is wack
Beating me in my world is hard to do (but why?)
'Cause my shit is fat, and that's hard to chew (oh)
And even harder to swallow
So bleed like Creed, yeah, die like Apollo and all who follow
Bullet attack the brain, will leave the head hollow
Here today but just like that, you're dead tomorrow
Leaving out the drug game and enter rap music on the top
