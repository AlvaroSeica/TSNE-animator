Song:   The Evolution of Man

Intro:
In the beginning man was created.  Image perfection.  
And although he was perfect, still something was missing.  
He was incomplete, unwhole.  Then woman was born.  
Together the creation of these two souls inertwined, 
and naturally, the two became one. Completion. 
When your soulmate is placed at your side, 
hold on for dear life no matter the obstacles in your path 
destiny is not temporary and true love will always last.  
Just as first man evolved, and together you two 
shall fufill destinies plan and together become one. 
Completion.  The evolution of man.

[The Anonymous]:
It's like, beyond physical attraction 
your explosive personality blows my mentality 
Actually my emotions on a rampage 
we ain't the same age but we in the same book, on the same page  
The conversation calls for meditation, 
never amateur check the calender let's make a reservation 
Communication is the bridge at times 
I wonder what your thinking, 
The truth will set you free like Abe Lincoln

[Brenda J]:
Free I'm totally +emancipated proclaiming+
is due to the love together we've created 
Our thoughts no longer seperated 
past barriers past road blocks you've opened 
my heart no need to pick the lock

[The Anonymous]:
The key to my heart should be the sole controller
Life is full of ups and downs like a roller coaster 
Im hip to your vibe like motorola 
As long as your a soldier im hanging in your world like a poster 
Supernova baby you shine extraterrestrial
Sometimes you throw me off like Jonah on a water vessel
But what we got is crazy real 
deep like a Navy Seal
plus I like the way you make me feel baby chill  
You know the deal you playing with a full deck 
trump tight no jokes ace's high in full affect

[Brenda J]:
Your affecting me and it's crazy cause love is a gamble 
Always had an ace up my sleeve incase my maid wanted to leave 
But now I ease dizzy from to much exhaling 
but not suffocating cause your my ...

[The Anonymous]:
The breath of life, what is a man without a wife?  
That's absurd like a butcher without a knife  
I slice through your thoughts with words that cut you short  
Your torch keep me burning my world no longer dark  
I spark with the best but you no contest 
Conquest on your love my mission accomplished
I feed you the knowledge your system digests  
You feed me the knowledge my system digests  
We make love in excess  
We progress through thick and thin X-ray vision like superman  
I see through the bullshit 
that's why i like your style 
able to leap tall buildings in a single bound

[Brenda J]:
Physically and mentally we related 
now I'm elated what was once meant to be is our reality 
And I'm loving every moment of our ecstasy 
not too many people get a chance to see 
A connection between two people based not on sexuality 
but something real
That's how you make me feel 
we formed a bond and I could go on forever 
telling the world how together we're two of a kind 
body soul and mind

[The Anonymous]:
What's mine is yours what's your is mine 
throughout the course of time 
we stay on point like a porcupine
Anytime everything move faster 
every king need a queen so you could be my Cleopatra 
And i could be your Shaka Zulu
I sock it to you I know you got the point 
baby doll I got the voodoo
I want you for the rest of my life 
and time is starting your love makes me 
weak in the knees like Tonya Harding 
You stole my heart and that's a felony 
prison is the penalty confined in my mind in brain cell block 3 
I locked you in my heart and threw away the key 
there's no escape I guard it like a maximum security

[Brenda J]:
Secure is how I feel 
knowing that your soul not just your physical is here with me 
And i thank the all mighty for the day that you invited me 
to share your life 
and book me I stole your heart yes I'm guilty so punish me 
Because your maximum security reassures me 
you'll never leave my side your spirtitual vibe

[The Anonymous]:
No doubt 
I be there like the Jackson 5 satisfaction's 
why I step to you with my plan like a mastermind 
We pass the time as we dine you sip a glass of wine
I looked you in your eyes 
and cast a line out of that's just mine  
You was amazed by the way that I attacked  
Now your white flag is raised high blowing in the gray sky  
Surrender your goods completely understood 
unlike them other chicks wishing they shoulda coulda would  
I told you once before baby I hit you 
with these them other cats don't stand 
a chance like Christopher Reeves
That's how it goes
You're not the type to wear provacative clothes 
Beautiful from your head to your popsicle toes
Good looking what you got cooking 
17 ways word to Michael Franks 
give it to me raw with the mallionaise
I take it downtown baby calm down making all the sounds 
like a figure 8 it's perfect all around
