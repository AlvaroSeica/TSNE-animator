*gunshots*
[Talking]
Yeah, I'm bout to introduce
Potential tragedy *laughs in the background*
this song goes out to every man who
ever been on the edge
and wanted to jump
but didnt....listen

[Verse 1]
I almost murdered my girlfriend this morning
This whole relationship has been very disappointing
We argued last night for 3 hours straight
What used to be unconditional love is now straight hate
Disrespect my manhood, I can't let her
I told her the type of dude that I was when I first met her
We clicked from day 1 and out the gate we had love
But the love we had at first turned to bad blood
More fussing and fighting and less communication
Led to a potential domestic situation
Was never satisfied with my choice of occupation
Gave no motivation, doubted my determination
Threats to put me out of her house were the worst case
Especially since I aint wanna move in in the first place
Said she'd never throw it in my face but she was lyin'
I'm trying, but she aint knowing she was this close to dyin'

[Hook]
I almost murdered my girlfriend
I almost murdered my girlfriend
I almost murdered my girlfriend this morning
Im tired of living in this hell
I'd rather be sitting in a jail cell
I almost murdered my girlfriend

[Verse 2]
I almost murdered my girlfriend this morning [Yeah]
At least 3 or 4 times I gave her fair warning
Unemployed, waiting for my money to improve
She was paying the bills so she started putting power moves
Telling me I aint a man, I'm sorry and I'm lazy
Talking to me in ways she never did and it's crazy
Never mentioned the time when she didn't have a dime
I grinded for her and two kids that wasnt even mine
Now the tables done turned and my pockets are clean
I started seeing her true colors and that color was green
You either love me or you don't love me, aint no in-between
Using your money as a weapon on my self esteem
Telling your friends all our problems you cried and lied
If you gon' put em in our business and these terrible signs
While they telling you what their husbands and boyfriends do
You on the phone complaining about what I aint doing for you
That's why..

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
She lay down and fell asleep without making the bed up
I'm fed up, her dirty friends pumping her head up
I ain't tripping on making love cuz even when we do
I'm trying to do my best to visualize any woman but you
But im sure you do the same thing too
Our problems ain't nothing new
Good times are far and few
You ask for my advice but when I hand it you drop it quick
Like you just wanna know what I'ma say so you can do the opposite
Years ago I should've quit you, you swung at me
I grabbed your hand, you told the police that I hit you
Official, theres too many problems we couldnt get through
Plus some issues with this one dude you refused to admit to
You wanna know a man? Study and see
Don't judge what he is today, try to see what he could be
I didn't kill her, I spared her life
But the next night I woke up and caught her standing over me with a knife
