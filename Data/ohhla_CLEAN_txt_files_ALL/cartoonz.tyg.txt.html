[Intro]
Zippin, dippin jabs super fast in a flash it's Tygaman, Tygaman
Tatted up on my mask, superhero for the cash it's Tygaman, Tygaman

[Chorus]
My life is, my life is like a cartoon y'all
More crazier than shh you ever saw
I *ZOOM* to the left and *ZOOM* to the right and
then I'm gah-gah-gone

[Intro]
Meet me, the Looney Tune 17 from the CPT
Ed, Edd 'n Eddy couldn't beat me in more D's
Roll 22's on the whip, they call them
Fantastic Fours and shh, whoa I'm sick
Introducing, Billy the Kid
Space jammin with Banana's In Pajamas, no homo
Excuse my manners, I go from Hulk to David Banner
Land of bandanas, they Yosemite Sam ya
Y'all, Fugazi like 2 Stupid Dogs talkin
as they walkin - I couldn't believe that shh
Oops I almost slipped, Porky Pig dollar bills
plus Tweety Bird sits on my wrist
Man, warning, you'll get booked like Orbitz
Your corpses will be with Yogi in the forest
Quick reminder, on short notice
I got the swag potion; take a sip until you're no longer sober

[Chorus] - 2X

[Tyga]
Stand down, we have a man down
I Tasmanian Devil in my bezel
The ice so heavy Bam Bam couldn't, lift my pebbles
The Flintstones say the stones make you flint as you stare in it
Ridiculous bright, with a little glare in it
The light beams off it like Tte Power Puff Girls who stare at it
My spaceship come equipped with a Jetson engine
To the Milky Way, I'm dippin
+Bravo+, +Johnny+ says, we're space pimpin
With the "HUH, HUH, HA" I always get 'em
The grill lookin O.J.-ish, but not Simpson
I'm more like blue and yellow mixed, Marge Simpson
You lil' countin chickens
Scooby Doo can't even figure out what Tyga's missin - maybe nothin
There's gotta be somethin; to rap, he's like carrots to Bugs Bunny
With cash I'm the Energizer Bunny, long money

[Chorus] - 2X
