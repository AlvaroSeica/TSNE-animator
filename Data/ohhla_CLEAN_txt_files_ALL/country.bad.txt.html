Ahhh, yeah(country blood, country blood, blood, 
Southern blood, southern blood, southern blood) 
I was born with this here, 
ain't nobody gon' take this here, know what I'm sayin' 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 

It's that country blood in my vain, 
thats why I do these buck thangs(buck thangs) 
It's that southern blood in my vain, 
thats why I do these damn buck thangs(buck thangs) 
It's that country blood in my vain, 
thats why I do these buck thangs(buck thangs) 
It's that southern blood in my vain, 
thats why I do these damn buck thangs(buck thangs) 
It's that country blood in my vain,

It's that country blood in my vain,

Verse 1: 
I confess the south been good to me 
Ain't work three months at the most player I'm 23 
Handle it, if I don't duck and dodge know that I'm stuck 
It be they shoulda, coulda, woulda boom bow-bow - buck 
A nigga influence, so i choke off dope all day 
Quit cho' thirst when the rest of em' ain't got nothin' to say 
More southern fried than fatback 
Deadlier than heart attack 
Bombs had to be dropped when I heard this fire track 
Forever fat, never slack, never lack 
Ain't got no problem when layin' a fool flat on his back 
Everyday its a hustle, lives gon' juggle 
Everybody ain't gon' get paid, somebody gon' struggle 
Overtime hustler, do all I can 
I put it down for real can't die a poor black man 
Nam'sayin' these country boys want millions 
And anything else ain't acceptable feelings 

It's that country blood in my vain, 
thats why I do these buck thangs(buck thangs) 
It's that southern blood in my vain,
thats why I do these damn buck thangs(buck thangs) 
It's that country blood in my vain, 
thats why I do these buck thangs(buck thangs) 
It's that southern blood in my vain, 
thats why I do these damn buck thangs(buck thangs) 
It's that country blood in my vain, 
thats why I do these buck thangs(buck thangs) 
It's that southern blood in my vain, 
thats why I do these damn buck thangs(buck thangs) 
Buck buck................ 

This country blood I fill my vains and dare a busta to take it 
My southern slang ain't gon' change and I know that chall' hate it 
We make you see this, show no pity for a busta 
And if you come slippin' me and my folk gon' have to touch ya' 
You think all we got is trailer parks, rednecks and chickens 
Country Klan folks puttin' brothers down with lynches 
I drank my drink, and smoke a lil' bud 
Slang yay with my folks in order to keep my pockets from actin' up 
Push em' up if it ain't enough 
I slang my caine as if I had to score a big Carolina platinum dub 
Boy I tell you we bout' comin' up 
All these folks wanna know what we be doin' but we keep it on the hush 
So ain't nothin' sisieful when it comes to us 
When I went to Elgin y'all say we cuss too much 
Surprise we right back at dis' music struggling bo' 
Act as though we ain't no it a get played on the radio 

It's that country blood in my vain, 
thats why I do these buck thangs(buck thangs) 
It's that southern blood in my vain, 
thats why I do these damn buck thangs(buck thangs) 
It's that country blood in my vain, 
thats why I do these buck thangs(buck thangs) 
It's that southern blood in my vain, 
thats why I do these damn buck thangs(buck thangs) 
Buck thang 

You laugh when we cut the words 
But its our corners you come to serve 
You bring your product puff, puff, puff, puff, roll the press 
Sold it to a sucker, under arrest 
Flirt, got it off big chest 
Now you boys listenin' to something that ain't all that fresh 
What to do? I don't know 
Bang it, bump it, slum it, man just bump it, 
Take it, sang it, roll down the window and just slang it 
Man let that suckah fly 
My country blood to free for dem' silly lies 
Just tell the truth, 
you shoulda let dem' southern boys cut cho' pies(pies) 

It's that country blood in my vain, 
thats why I do these buck thangs(buck thangs) 
It's that southern blood in my vain, 
thats why I do these damn buck thangs(buck thangs) 
It's that country blood in my vain, 
thats why I do these buck thangs(buck thangs) 
It's that southern blood in my vain, 
thats why I do these damn buck thangs(buck thangs) 
Buck thang buck thangs buck that's do these damn buck thangs...</pre>
