[Moka Only] (chorus 2x)
Swollen Members gonna make y'all stop
Take a minute and remember who takes the top
To the critics and the cynics your time is up
Just admit it everybody knows this rhyme is up
It's hot shiiiit...

[Prevail]
Perfected but not invented
Rhymes from the ego driven self centered
Entered the fast lane and never got dented
Life in a flash pipes buds and hash
Three of my favorite more has made this
More hits than the majors up from the minors
Bust from the top duck cops and sirens
Fresh out the shop poppin' n' stylin'

[Madchild]
Madchild whylin' nonidentical
The cynical is medical condition is critical
Unforgettable Swollen Members beautiful
Language unsuitable ten gin and tonic
Coastal Chronic track got Moka on it
Independent with a diffirent perspective
Select effective next {*scratch sound*} on exit
the young and the restless fool fuel innjected

[Moka Only] (chorus 2x)
Swollen Members gonna make y'all stop
Take a minute and remember who takes the top
To the critics and the cynics your time is up
Just admit it everybody knows this rhyme is up
It's hot shiiiit...

Y'all aint got it so don't even think about it
Cuz I'm doubt if ya know the top
Swollen Members, Moka Only gunna take the shot
If you think you betcha know you better press rewind
You can bump it in ya Sony, repossess your mind
If you front it you can blow or you can testify
Someone else was about what it takes to climb
Whenever battle axe warriors come out to play
You can bet we gonna do it in a thousand way
And we sweating off the duel we resuscitate
Members only rock... shiiit...
So motherfuck debate... it's hot shiiit...

[Prevail]
How many albums bought n sold
Triple ghetto gold rocked and rolled
Sound.... mixed and mastered
Stick with the program, get paid after
TV shows, zeens and magz
Positive feedback, jeans still sagged
Heads still knocked, Prevails gets props
The same as always rising to the top

[Madchild]
With the swarm of excitement
fighting form we invite critisicm
Rhyme shine like prism
Spit flames we see in 3D vision
Even my people play CD in prison
Bad decision, fatal error
Get scars from bars and barbaric terror
We own label never get dropped
now the crew combined and we can't be stopped

[Moka Only] (chorus 4x)
Swollen Members gonna make y'all stop
Take a minute and remember who takes the top
To the critics and the cynics your time is up
Just admit it everybody knows this rhyme is up
It's hot shiiiit...</pre>
