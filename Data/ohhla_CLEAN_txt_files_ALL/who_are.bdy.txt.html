[Intro: Ice-T]
YEAH!!

[Verse One: Ice-T]
You say that I hang out all night, that's okay
Cause you drink all motherfucking day
You come home, hit moms, smack mom, beat mam
Raise another brew to your face with you swollen palm
Then you come in my room talking crazy shit
Saying I'm high, I'm on dope, and I better quit
Motherfucker, if I was high, you would die
Hit my moms once more, and it's bye-bye

[Chorus:]
[Ice-T:-] Who are you trying to judge me?
[Ernie-C] GET THE FUCK OUT MY FACE!!
[Ice-T:-] Who put you so above me?
[Ernie-C] CLEAR THE FUCK OUT MY SPACE!!
[Ice-T:-] Who are you trying to judge me?
[Ernie-C] GET THE FUCK OUT MY FACE!!
[Ice-T:-] Who put you so above me?

[Verse Two: Ice-T]
You say that I want sex all the time
That's all that seems to be on my motherfucking mind
Well that's right, I want sex every minute
Every hour of the day, of the week, all the motherfucking time
But hold up, who are you trying to talk shit?
You'll hit your knees, sucking dick with a quickness
In the park, the dark, the car, the grass, licking nuts
Sucking butt, with your tongue up my fucking ass

[Chorus:]
[Ice-T:-] Who are you trying to judge me?
[Ernie-C] GET THE FUCK OUT MY FACE!!
[Ice-T:-] Who put you so above me?
[Ernie-C] CLEAR THE FUCK OUT MY SPACE!!
[Ice-T:-] Who are you trying to judge me?
[Ernie-C] GET THE FUCK OUT MY FACE!!
[Ice-T:-] Who put you so above me?

[Hook: Ice-T]
GET THE FUCK OUT MY FACE!! GET THE FUCK OUT MY FACE!!
GET THE FUCK OUT MY FACE!! GET THE FUCK OUT MY FACE!!
YEAH!!

[Chorus:]

 * Ernie-C played a 26 seconds of electronic guitar

[Chorus:]

[Outro: Ice-T]
You need to stay the fuck out my face
Stay the fuck out my Goddamn face!</pre>
