[Chorus]
Youse a big fine woman, won'tcha flex one time
You educated - flex one time
Got a pocket full of money, won'tcha flex one time
Flex one time, flex one time

Now BREATHE {*inhaling and exhaling deeeply*}
Now BREATHE {*inhaling and exhaling deeeply*}

[Verse One]
Yeah that's how you do it, just like that
Yeah, uhh, yeah, uhh
Uhh, awww baby flex one time
I ain't seen this since I had sex online
Baby I'm good you can check my grind
Yeah it's flea market but the Rolex on time
Your girl down with it yeah she next in line
How you feel about this? Let's be real about this
One mo' drank you can feel about this
Yeah it's one night stand and I'm killin this shhh

[Verse Two]
All my girls say (OWWW) dogs say yo
Fifth, flip now we good to go
I wanna touch I wanna feel, you know I wan' flex
Hotel room and some real good sex
Yesss~! I wanna flex one time
Get'cha girlfriend, let's do that one time
Baby oil blackrub, just one time
Girl that Patron got me out of my mind

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
Yo, with her fine ass
Chillin in the V.I.P. section with her wine glass
Sophisticated funk, sexy, pretty brown eyes
The kind you want to get, the hunter of the hound dogs
Droppin dollars, now they in the hole like ground hogs
Stay in baller mode, I'm at the bar sippin slowww
Left the Grand Mar' alone
Came back on that grown, sippin on that 'tron
Maybe, later on we can text a line
Right now, get up on the flo' and just unwind
Do what'chu do best and flex in time
We gon' get it right, for now I suggest we grind

[Interlude]
Now BREATHE {*inhaling and exhaling deeeply*}
Now BREATHE {*inhaling and exhaling deeeply*}

[Chorus]

[Verse Four]
What's next in line, got sex on mind
Tell me how quick you sound girl I pressed for time
You a sexy dime, I'm worth a cool million
Add it all together girl we can make a killin
You a star, you should be in the filmin
Written all over your face, know what you feelin
Uh-uh~! Baby don't fight the feelin
You know what it is, Nasty Roots in the building

[Verse Five]
Let it breeze, get'cha flex on
They showin off in here, get'cha flex on
If you ridin the bench, get'cha press on
Work it out for me shawty, get'cha stretch on
You doin it baby - flex one time
Keep doin it baby - two step one time
Move your hands in and out like a exercise
Cause you know who the shit, go on flex one time
