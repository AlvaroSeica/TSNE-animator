[Intro]
This one goes out, from the bottom of our hearts
to the most important lady in our lives
It's time to pay some respect...
I hope you're proud of us, 'cause we're proud of you..

[Lonely Island]
MAMA! -- You raised me right
MAMA! -- Showmed me the light
MAMA! -- Through pain and strife
MAMA! -- You gave us life

[Jorm]
When I fell down, you were there to pick me up
When I felt bad, you were there to build me up
Gave everything you had in the world to me
and you made me the man I'm supposed to be

[Andy]
Jane, even though I don't say it often enough
I appreciate everything you did for us
Never take you for granted 'cause it ain't hard to see
The best parts of you are now a part of me
OUR MAMA!

{*singing*}
And when it's cold outside, you kept us warm and held us down

{*door opens*}
 [Mom] Hi boys, who wants a snack?
 [Andy] MOM, GET OUT! WE'RE IN THE STUDIO!
 [Mom] Just checking on my guys!
 [Jorm] Get outta here!!
 [Andy] WE'RE MAKING A TRACK, YOU IDIOT!
 [Mom] Ohhhhhh!
 [Andy] JUST LEAVE!
 [Jorm] GO! 
 [Mama] Okie doke!
 [Jorm]GO!
 [Andy] YOU SUCK, MOM!
{*door closes*}

[Jorm]
Yeah my one true love, my heart, my mom
Showin respect in the form of this song
So when life gets hard and it makes you cry
I'll always be there to wipe a tear from your eye

[Andy]
My mom my number one fan, my best friend
And I'll never disrespect- {*door opens*}
 
 [Jorm] MOM! {*grunts*}
 [Mom] I know you said you weren't hungry, but I made ants-on-a-log
 [Andy] GET THE FUCK OUT!!!
 [Jorm] LEAVE! LEAVE! LEAVE! GO!!
 [Mom] So, how's you little club going?
 [Andy] It's not a CLUB!!!
 [Jorm] It's a RAP group!!
 [Mom] Why don't we leave these here anyway and eat them if you..{*door closes*}
 [Jorm] FINE!
 [Andy] GO TO HELL, MOM!!

[Jorm]
She's an angel on eath with invisible wings
I put no one above in summer, winter, or spring
or fall- {*door opens*}

 [Mom] Have you guys seen the remote?
 [Andy] OH MY GOD!!
 [Jorm] LEAVE US ALONE!!
 [Andy] FUCK YOU, MOM!! {*breaks glass*}
 [Mom] Watch it!
 [Jorm] LEAVE US ALONE!!
 [Andy] I HOPE YOU FUCKING DIE!! {*door closes*}

[Jorm] (Andy)
Jump in front of a bullet if it could save my mom
(You got a gun, go and pull it, 'cause she will never see harm)
Sh-{*door opens*}

 [Mom] Never mind, I found it
 [Jorm] God-DAMN IT!! {*breaks glass*}
 [Andy] OH MY GAWD!! NO ONE CARES ABOUT THE REMOTE, YOU ASSHOLE!!
 [other male voice] Laura, everything okay?
 [Andy] SHUT THE FUCK UP, DALE!! {*breaks more glass*}
 [Jorm] SHUT UP!!
 [Mom] Hey! Be nice to Dale
 [Andy + Jorm] FUCK DALE!!!
 [Jorm] I can't believe you have SEX with that guy!

{Lonely Island singing while shouting and glass breaks continues in background}
This goes out to all the mamas
Tryin to protect their kids from drama
Love was her golden rule
No matter what they say, you're beautiful
So push yo' lighters in the sky
Wave 'em back from side to side
And if you ever feel lost and alone
Let our voices guide you home {*door opens*}

 [Mom] Is something burning down there?
 [Andy] GET THE FUCK OUT NOW!!!!</pre>
