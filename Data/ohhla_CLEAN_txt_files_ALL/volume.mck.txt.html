Tell the sound man to turn my shit up then turn that other shit down
I get down like mothership's george
Via slang words and onomonopias definition competition like trips see ya!
Used to bust a rhyme like leader's till I had to leave em letter t'ing (stretched out)
Blame apollo he's the one who brought the beat in I just grabbed the mic
Then came to see em
MCing pen in hand or no pen freeing
The go in's frequent above weak shit I get down word's bond
And I don't need cosigns to off what aint on
just let a nigga rhyme like he wanna back a whole room into a corner
treat it like war when I'm performing
On it honest
Vocal cords quaking up the bass daily bread shaking up the place!

Chorus:
If the music aint loud enough when the dj's on the cut
somebody tell the sound man turn it up please
I'm rocking in the pocket locked in on it like a target
b that other shit is garbage,man turn this up!

Back to the grill again 92 street corners with the grimy viewed subject matter
Crews groom their 1-2 through subdue
Some of who I once knew respect due
But not enough when funds like these
The bread need cheese word em up!
Snubbies on tuct in case the revolutions in a rush the front liners can line them up
Then let them bust!
The level your favorite is on I speak above and I aint gotta say it cause who compares to what ?
Dollar bill hill piling up
Hands out
Every fingers waiting for a cut (get in line)
the evolve revolves around shine but if you can't rock with the glow then never mind
Watch it some other time regardless of who y'all is I get biz I will shine

Chorus:
If the music aint loud enough when the dj's on the cut
somebody tell the sound man turn it up please
I'm rocking in the pocket locked in on it like a target
b that other shit is garbage,man turn this up!</pre>
