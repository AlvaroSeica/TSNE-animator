Artist: Wale
Album:  More About Nothing (Mixtape)
Song:   The Problem
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

This isn't no griot but a mere portion of a semi-important life
Far from a complaint, but a mere look at the present showin you the changes that I made
The proverbial lemonade that I made
I made my mistakes, you see life's lemons often times come in a abundance,
In conjunction with the pressure that we're under
Underrated some would say, hated, and some say it's the things I say or how I say em.
And I admit, in this race I tend to struggle to relate in words
It's like I'm an alien who alienates by the herd, so as far as being heard
I guess I gotta wait, deprived by the station's eye
Wale, more times than not, am not for whom the air waves
Thank God for the free thinkers, for you keep me in mind,
In this state of mind that I'm in, for you keep me in the race with the baton that yall give
And they hype beat, street wear, Versace and Vuitton that I'm in
And really don't matter unless yall comin with
No days off, may we rip the face of the whole game off,
I'm gon say it to yall, I'm gonna put my faith in yall when I don't understand me
They say I'm runnin hip-hop but I'd rather unify with yall then stampede
And lastly for everybody who doubted I can't live without you, please
Continue to inspire the fire that is my re-dedication to greatness yall
Paint a picture to A.D. to freestyles to famous songs we out 'chere
Unforgettable gestures, unmeasurable effort, to pleasure the masses with impeccable work ethic
Let's get it, I go hard, no days off

Paint on my face, layin back rollin the J
Feelin like these rap niggaz aint as real as they say
That's why I keep my friends limited, Keep them hoes interested
Resented by the game like I'm Pete Rose in this bitch
Ain't nothin stoppin us, tell you what the problem is
I'm on top of my game but these niggaz won't acknowledge it
So a nigga hungry as a plastic hippopotamus
So stoppers better take it in the blood like a phlebotomist

[Skit]

Paint on my face, layin back rollin the J
Feelin like these rap niggaz aint as real as they say
That's why I keep my friends limited, Keep them hoes interested
Resented by the game like I'm Pete Rose in this bitch
Ain't nothin stoppin us, tell you what the problem is
I'm on top of my game but these niggaz won't acknowledge it
So a nigga hungry as a plastic hippopotamus
So stoppers better take it in the blood like a phlebotomist

I walk around understandin the politics
Wish you niggaz father understood where the condom was
'06 came, had all kind of buzz, and Isaiah say one day your time will come
Then '09 came, them bad record sales, the silver-linin couldn't find him up on any shelf
I'm in the mirror like "this a product of my skills?" and I fear that my fans say I failed
It's just my fate, lemme chill, nah flip, my shit was submarine like, under ship
Look at what I'm up against, scrutiny, criticism, everybody judgin off a single I ain't even pick
Now my eyes Chinese, keep the lau in, now I'm takin these pills and I aint even sick
Ice and Rain, Letter, Center of Attention, I wanted them on my debut, but they aint wanna listen
You know I love my team, but they couldn't see my vision,
Interscope is my fam, so I ain't tryn make no issue
I'm just tryin to paint that picture, When I'm rhyming up in this booth
Imma try to rhyme and get through, but I'm documentin the truth
Men lie. Women lie. Numbers won't forsaken, the only album flop is the album niggaz hate so
A.D. two, oh no way, let's do this and God willin' niggaz gonna triple up the munnies
Triple up the munnies, wisdom is improvin, if no one's there to listen guess I'll put it in the music
Triple up the munnies, wisdom is improvin, I'm headin to Vienna since yall niggaz ain't doin shit</pre>
