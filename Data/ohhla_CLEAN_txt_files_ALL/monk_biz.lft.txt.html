[Verse One: Redman]
We like to party, up in the club, with bottle poppin
We goin and goin energizer bunny no stoppin
'Round of applause when we see ladies booty clappin
My money so tall I gotta JUMP when I count it
Wannabes a bumble 'cause we doin it big
And dem waan fi see we stumble nah go happen you dig?
Plus di gyal dem a follow me gyal dem a follow me back to my crib
Dem a stick to mi like dem is a part of my skin
Party animal, you can call we
We got your hands up like this is a robbery
Leftside and Redman on the world beat 
And you can call us Miami 'cause we got the Heat, monkey biz

[Verse Two: Redman]
Yo! I be smokin (Yeah!) on that sour (OW!)
You can't smell it I turn it a little louder
A nigga like me smoke with Obama
Then I gave a shotgun to Lady Gaga 
'Cause I'm a boss homie, I run my own shit
Hangin with broke niggas that'll make no sense
I'm on my monkey bizniz with banana clips
I'm Cheech And Chong younger brother on the cannabis
Bro! I see them women twerkin on the dance floor
Ass so big I don't think she got no pants on
She get it from my mama and some from my grandma
And she volunteer to give it up on camera
MONKEY BIZ!

[Chorus: Leftside] (Redman)
Monkey biz monkey biz monkey bizniz, monkey biz monkey biz monkey bizniz
