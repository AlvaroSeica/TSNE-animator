We Boss Hogging, up in here
That's what we do, we Boss Hogging
We Boss Hogging, up in here
That's what we do, we Boss Hogging

[Kyleon]
I got money, but Killa don't spoil her
And after I cut her mayn, Killa don't call her
Now that's the true, definition of a baller
Knock a chick down, and don't give a chick a quarter
I'm a candy blue, 22 inch crawler
7-45, I retired my Impala
I'm a hustler, all about a dolla
And if it ain't about money, I ain't gon holla
Plus I'm a pimp, I'ma pop my colla
Po' up the white cup, then take a swalla
The best rappers, will respect that nigga
And if the beat jamming, I'ma wreck that nigga
I'm the greatest, get it through your melon nigga
I'm the best yet, I been telling niggaz
A hot boy, I've been selling nigga
Cause this man's on fire, I'm Denzel'ing niggaz

[Hook]

[Kyleon]
I'm not a reverend, but I preach to these niggaz
I'm one of the hottest rappers, in the streets to these niggaz
I comfortably speak heat, to these niggaz
All you other cats whack, I been peeping these niggaz
Not a DJ, but K slay niggaz
Killa with the flow, I DK niggaz
The best rapper, since that BK nigga
2Pac, Biggie and that Freeway nigga
My name's Killa, I'll lyrically murder ya
You're not a rapper, if I ain't heard of ya
You not getting good dope, if I ain't serving ya
You're not getting whipped G, what are you nervous for
I spit facts, on the track boy
I'm even known in St. Louis, and I ain't a track boy
Ask around, I'm the hottest nigga rapping
With just another gat, that's on the track yapping</pre>
