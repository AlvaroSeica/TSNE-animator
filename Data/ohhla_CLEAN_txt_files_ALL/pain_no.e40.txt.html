Chuck Taylor, Big Snoop, California's Finest!

[Chorus]
I'm doin' everything I can to get my buzz on (Gotta get mah buzz on)
Tryin' not to feel this pain no more (No more, no more, no more)
That's why I'm poppin' these pills and smokin' this dro and drinkin' this henny straight
Tryin' not to feel this pain no more. (No more, no more, no more)

[E-40]
I came from the bottom of the barrel
To everyday new apparel, from a shoe string budget
To more jewelry than a pharoah
About a place called Valiath(?)
House smaller than that hut
First city in California to go bankrupt
Came a long way let the truth be told
Penetentiary chances sweatin over the stove
Seen 'em come and go, I'm the last of my crop
Don't compare me to nobody less ya talkin' bout Pac
Just tryin' to survive and stay alive
So many of my people done died
Now days, you an OG, if yo leader be 25
My partner in there with his grand daddy, doin 25
Liftin' water bags, doin Burpees exercise
I hand pick my friends, cuz people ain't trustable
Feelings like bras, their motives is questionable
Suckers sneak diss me then call me up on the phone
They say 40 Water I just wanna be on.

[Chorus]
I'm doin' everything I can to get my buzz on (Gotta get mah buzz on)
Tryin' not to feel this pain no more (No more, no more, no more)
That's why I'm poppin' these pills and smokin' this dro and drinkin' this henny straight
Tryin' not to feel this pain no more. (No more, no more, no more)

[The Game]
Yeah
Hey yo 40
Let me talk to you for a minute, homie
They say money make the world go round
And since I'm worth 20 mil
I wanna see this bitch spin like the rims on Schwinn
Hop on that bike, ride through the neighborhood
Compton on smash, them boys get cash
Money like Baby do, I gotta scar over my heart
Cuz that's what hatin'll do
So watch ya back like a tattoo artist
A coffin don't give a fuck about who the hardest
You lay with the people who more pray, 
Get ya name etched in stone, withcha born day
Small talk over a glass of grand marye(sp?)
As I sip from the class, my mind starts packin' his Louis Vatton bags
Take a trip to the past, hear that shot gun blast
See my brother lying dormant, IV's in his arm
Can't you see he got piss bag
17 years old and you nigga's wonder why I'm so cold

[Chorus]
I'm doin' everything I can to get my buzz on (Gotta get mah buzz on)
Tryin' not to feel this pain no more (No more, no more, no more)
That's why I'm poppin' these pills and smokin' this dro and drinkin' this henny straight
Tryin' not to feel this pain no more. (No more, no more, no more)

[Snoop Dogg]
Let me get a fifth of Celandia
Plate of some candy
Cindy, Sandy, Mindy, Mandy
Tina, Brandy, Keisha, Angie
Man we, can we, all get a long
Two shots of patron
I did it till the break of dawn
Big fish in the pond, runnin' my triathalon
Doggy dogg, keep the bomb, 
One of a kind, blow yo mind just like Einstein
Blow and shine
I'm gettin mine, prime time like 21
Get er done, Everything in my life I make it look like fun
Every day of my life, I'm tryin' to get my buzz on
Cuz on, some on other shit, I'm keepin' it on the under, bitch
So much pain I over came, same thing
Me and 40 and Game came from the same gang
But you wouldn't understaind, 
I'm populatin' wit my weakest translation
That's my main mane, let me hit that damn thang

[Chorus]
I'm doin' everything I can to get my buzz on (Gotta get mah buzz on)
Tryin' not to feel this pain no more (No more, no more, no more)
That's why I'm poppin' these pills and smokin' this dro and drinkin' this henny straight
Tryin' not to feel this pain no more. (No more, no more, no more)</pre>
