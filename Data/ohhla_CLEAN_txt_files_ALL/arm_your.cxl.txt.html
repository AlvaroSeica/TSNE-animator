[Chorus: DV Alias Khrist]
This game is cold
I told my broad I won't be comin home
Lost my job, I lost my mind
Lost everything I own
The city got me fucked up
Yo these pigs got me fucked up
Music on the radio is fucked up
I hop in the truck and only wanna feel the pain

[Chino XL]
Chino XL, and FUCK everybody else!
FUCK everybody else! FUCK everybody else!
Immortal Technique, and FUCK everybody else!
FUCK everybody else! FUCK everybody else!
Psycho Realm, and FUCK everybody else!
FUCK everybody else! FUCK everybody else!
Real lyricists and FUCK everybody else!
All my street soldiers stand up, arm yo'selves

[Sick Jacken]
What the fuck happened to rap?
I need to put my lyrical clip in, it's on homie, gun clappin is back
These pop acts make me wanna pop gats
This whole shit is fucked up cause radio just broadcast trash
You're out of whack, blast my semi-auto tracks
Launchin deadly hollow caps and takin out the wack and many follow that
Swallow that, I'll burn your vocal like I'm bottle Jack
You thought you had the streets cause I was gone, well we just got it back
Homie you can check my team
It's super ugly when you get us all together - Sick, Tech and Chi
This reign of terror won't end with me
I spawned a little Psycho cause my baby mama kept that seed
Now I'ma take a little trip to these radio stations
Grab them punk ass DJ's, wave guns in their faces
If they don't play my shit then it's welcome to Hell
Cause all we want is Immortal Tech, Chino and The Psycho Realm

[Chorus]

[Chino XL]
Immortal Technique, and FUCK everybody else!
FUCK everybody else! FUCK everybody else!
Psycho Realm, and FUCK everybody else!
FUCK everybody else! FUCK everybody else!
Chino XL, and FUCK everybody else!
FUCK everybody else! FUCK everybody else! (YEAH!)
Real lyricists and FUCK everybody else!
All my street soldiers stand up, arm yo'selves

Yo, yeah, yo
Chino's ill, slap off your cosmetics
I arm myself like a veteran puttin on prosthetics
My barbaric genetics bring pain
The only +Revolution+ that you've ever seen is Prince's group and "Purple Rain"
Deranged monster is sponsored
You get shit on and pissed on like Tila Tequila at a Juggalos concert
Ain't tryna be glamorous, hammers we snap like cameras
I'm fuckin intense/in tents like teenage camp counselors
Spit blood through your stereo, there we go, time for your burial
Fag niggaz after you rhyme say "No hetero"
My murderous sentences, no secrets where my weapons is
Locked in the closet next to pop rappers sexual preferences
Amber alert, your girl's mouth ran away with my kids
If you're sick then I should be diagnosed with three days to live (yeah)
You slip I'll kidnap you and give you a mean death
Beat you with your Blackberry 'til there's barely a screen left (aww man!)
Jack and Tech my dogs like entr√©es in the Philippines
My mistress is villainy, rapin and pillagin lyrically (yeah)
My symphonies sinfully biblically loved by killers
Who gives a fuck who's the greatest rapper alive long as Chino's the illest (yeah)

[Chorus]

[Immortal Technique]
Fuck a silent revolution, soldier, I'm on the warpath
I'll throw my commandments, down on your platinum calf
You'll get your face slashed like a Riker's Island reminder
Behind ya snipers'll find ya whether you run to China
or try to crawl the fuck back, in your mother's vagina
And I don't need a fuckin co-signer
to murder gassed-up, underground niggaz like coal miners
Bring it back payin homage to the old-timers
I was bred as a carnivore, bred as a cannibal
Flow sicker than pictures of people fuckin animals
Like a car crash ripped in half neck to the crotch
Motherfuckers scared to stare but they secretly watch
Niggaz wanna play Shaytan? Well let's get it on
I'll fire missiles like the fuckin shit that hit the Pentagon
You not strong enough to do a song with me, I'm the truth
Like Tina Turner motherfucker, you'll get raped in a booth
Nigga~!

[Chorus]

[Chino XL]
Chino XL, and FUCK everybody else!
FUCK everybody else! FUCK everybody else!
Immortal Technique, and FUCK everybody else!
FUCK everybody else! FUCK everybody else!
Psycho Realm, and FUCK everybody else!
FUCK everybody else! FUCK everybody else!
Real lyricists and FUCK everybody else!
All my street soldiers stand up, arm yo'selves</pre>
