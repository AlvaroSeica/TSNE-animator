UGH!!

[Zack de la Rocha]
The movie, ran through me
The glamour, subdue me
The tabliod, untie me
I'm empty, please fill me
Mister Anchor, assure me
That Baghdad, is buring
Your voice it is so soothing
That cunning mantra of killing
I need you, my witness
To dress this up so bloodless
To numb me and purge me now
Of thoughts of blaming you
Yes the car is, our wheelchiar
My witness, your coughing
Oily silence mocks thw legless
Now traveling in coffins
But on the CORNER (CORNER)
The jury's SLEEPLESS (SLEEPLESS)
We found your WEAKNESS (WEAKNESS)
..and it's right outside our door

Hook:
NOW TESTIFY!!
NOW TESTIFY!!
And it's right outside our door
NOW TESTIFY!!
NOW TESTIFY!!
And it's right outside our door!

With precision, you feed me
My witness, I'm hungry
Your temple it calms me, so I can carry on
My slaving, sweating, the skin right off my bones
On a bed of fire, I'm choking, on the smoke that fills my home
The wrecking ball is rushing
Witness, your blushing
The pipeline is gushing
While here we lie in tombs
While on the CORNER (CORNER)
The jury's SLEEPLESS (SLEEPLESS)
We found your WEAKNESS (WEAKNESS)
..and it's right outside our door

Hook:
NOW TESTIFY!!
YEAH TESTIFY!!
It's right outside our door
NOW TESTIFY!!
NOW TESTIFY!!
It's right outside our door!

Mass graves for the pump and the price is set, and the price is set
Mass graves for the pump and the price is set, and the price is set
Mass graves for the pump and the price is set, and the price is set
Mass graves for the pump and the price is set, and the price is set

[guitar riff]

Who controls the past now controls the future
Who controls the present now controls the past
Who controls the past now controls the future
Who controls the present now?

Hook:
NOW TESTIFY!!
TESTIFY!!
It's right outside our door
NOW TESTIFY!!
TESTIFY!!
It's right outside our door!</pre>
