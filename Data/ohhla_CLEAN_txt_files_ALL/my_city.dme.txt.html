...you can kiss my ass!
You can kiss my ass!
Yo, you can kiss my ass!
Yo, yo, yo- It don't stop
Yo, it don't quit

[King Midas]
"Don't fuckin' play around... in my city
It's all good, it's all good
It's all good- It's all good"

In my city, it's kinda hard to find somebody to trust
Ain't no pitty, they pull your card. Retalliation's a must
When I bust, it's for a reason- Not just huntin' season
on my own kind- Huntin' my niggas wit' a chrome nine
Been a long time since I wrote a long rhyme
'bout how I felt the guard- How they was shelt and belt
From the crowd to a stage, reppin' loud just to live
Though I'm foul, bitches, how you like me now?
K-O-D done finaly made a name
for they self- Make the wealth in this crazy game
Played the same, but in the D it's much different
Family members go and repeat before they visit
What is it that makes D-Town so off the hook
Keepin' real niggas crankin' and bitch niggas shook
So if you wanna go somewhere where the bitches is pretty,
but they'll saw your head off- Nigga, come to my city

[Drunken Master]
My city is where it's at
My city is where it's deep
My city is where the niggas get to shootin' in the street
My city is where the bitches is cute but still canivin'
My city is where the ultimate goal is just survivin'
My city is where it's at
My city is where it's deep
My city is where the niggas get to shootin' in the street
My city is where the bitches is cute but still canivin'
My city is where the ultimate goal is just survivin'
In my city

[King Midas]
In my city, they go to jail and make bail before the day done
King's gettin' kisses on rings ever since day one
and their families ahead, hear what I said
See many niggas bleedin' from head, layin' dead
Runnin' from Feds, everyday thing in my town
Mothafuckas attain fame and bring in pounds
Bangin' the sound on the block- The mayor of Ole,
the K-O-D and all the niggas that know me
and sippin' O-E, toke trees wit' all the O-G's
When niggas blow B's and get high and don't wanna go ease
Tell a story of the thug to come a king
Having nothing, not even turkey and stuffing
Think I'm bluffing about the way I was living?
Roll back the clock, ye back Thanksgiving

[Drunken Master]
My city is where it's at
My city is where it's deep
My city is where the niggas get to shootin' in the street
My city is where the bitches is cute but still canivin'
My city is where the ultimate goal is just survivin'
My city is where it's at
My city is where it's deep
My city is where the niggas get to shootin' in the street
My city is where the bitches is cute but still canivin'
My city is where the ultimate goal is just survivin'

[King Midas]
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive
So why the weak niggas don't hit and the strong don't die?
I can't lie- The D-E-T taught me many of lessons
Expressin' all my mind aggression wit' my Smif-n-Wesson
because Detroit ain't no hoe, nigga- We let you know, nigga
When there's some beef, we accumulate like snow, nigga
Go toe-to-toe quicker wit' any foe wit' it
Now, that's a go getta and plus my flow sicka
Any nigga wanna roll wit' the King Dub?
The D-E-T gotta roll wit' a mean mug
Done seen coke delt, done seen soap melt
in beans through the hoods where they goin' for self
wit' no wealth to call out fouls and violation
Then circle wit' heat, saught out annihilation

[Drunken Master]
My city is where it's at
My city is where it's deep
My city is where the niggas get to shootin' in the street
My city is where the bitches is cute but still canivin'
My city is where the ultimate goal is just survivin'
My city is where it's at
My city is where it's deep
My city is where the niggas get to shootin' in the street
My city is where the bitches is cute but still canivin'
My city is where the ultimate goal is just survivin'
My city is where it's at
My city is where it's deep
My city is where them niggas get to shootin' in the street
My city is where them bitches is cute but still canivin'
My city is where the ultimate goal is just survivin'. Uh.
3-1-3 baby.
Detroit, nigga. '99, Drunkenstyle, baby.
Recognize.
King Midas, K-O-D, representin' Lovely.</pre>
