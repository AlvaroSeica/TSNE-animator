[Saul Williams - singing]
As we approach the waterfall
All the rocks underneath
I take your hand to ease your worry
and kiss your trembling teeth
There is no need to fear disaster
There is no need for fear at all
I feel the water moving faster
It is our time to fall

At night I feel the water falling
as I play underneath
Through wind and rain I hear you calling
Rustling through my sheets
Dark is the night when you are absent
There is no moon, there is no star
I close my eyes to feel your presence
I cannot wait to fall

I have survived the waterfall
and the rocks underneath
I am a memory of the ocean
Water beneath my feet
The rising tide I feel within me
lifts me beyond the stars of night
I am the death of every motion
The soaring half of life</pre>
