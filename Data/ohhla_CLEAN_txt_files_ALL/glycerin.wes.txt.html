[Verse 1]
Singapore slasher my dialogue brings disaster
Rhyme master I'm the before and the after
Trail with the blazer alpha and omega
Cerwin vega hell raiser bout to craze ya
Bringing frost to ya tundra acu to your puncture
Spit thunder what da bumba you can stop the thunder
Any man trying to know me must be ready to die
Like nimrod shooting arrows to the heavenly skies
I seduce you with flava kill your crew like euthanasia
Don't believe as the youth in Asia
My dialog attracts many listeners Israelites Hari Krishnas
Maestro glycerin blown up your transistors
Still I'm innovative and syncopated
Holy water dolo, maes and cinco sprayed it nickel plated
Heavyweight punch of Cassius I stun the masses
Toronto's argonaut I'll tranquilize your trilogy
With the ministry NCAA top ten killing spree
Division three rappers lack efficiency your blind where your vision be?
Lyrics are flammable scorchin and torchin the set
Extortin your net profit to every time I drop its like a miracle
super what? Super lyrical!

[CHORUS]
Were on fire tonight make it hot like a wire tonight
Round the clock block to block every time we drop
Were on fire tonight take you higher tonight
Round the clock block to block every time we drop

[Verse 2]
I hit a melody heavily and incredible poetically
My energy's steadily raisin blazin amazin
Toronto mega city champ with this spankin hit
Every time I leave my gates the cameras click
I smoke a riddim like a cancer stick got you amped with this
I rep my city every chance I get
A lot of suckers screw me when I rock the roughest jewelry
Cant do nothin to me I m deadlier than Russian roulie
I got italian rappers callin me the toughest moulie
Honeys love me cause I'm dark skinned with a touch of coolie
Verbally I'm like a slick assassin trigger blastin
Niggas askin how I got my dime pieceÂ…Trinidadian
Send your squad to Satan me fallin off is like the rock of Gibraltar
Breakin raps Walter Payton
Ya cant stop it and every time I drop
its like another miracle, super what? Super lyrical

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
The fire spittin rhyme thrower sabotagin the set
With the holocaust you couldn't tame me maestro khomeni
The mercenary 49th parallel assassin still I'm making audio dramatic
Charismatic lyrical man miracle man
Plus my physical be guided through a spiritual plan
Heat seeker piece keeper I bring grim to the reaper
Hollow points release through your speakers
My raps are freakin on the streets tracks be leakin
I'm magnifique n' wildin' like the last mohican
Still the wickedest vet nobody's slicker than Wes
Rippin your chest I'm raisin spirits like a biblical text
And my vernaculars still attackin ya, smackin and cappin ya
Super spectacular causin a massacre
You can't stop it and every time I drop its like a miracle super what?
Super lyrical.</pre>
