Song:   Back at It
Typed by: iamomni dot com

I'm back at it
exercising all my bad habits
hennessey and apple juice
I smoke my lungs asthmatic
I write my lyrics like black magic
get busy watch the record turn heads let it burn
my eyes cold burgundy I'm distant
all I see is digits its never enough I'm high tolerant
if it anit broke why bother it
I stand for the obvious you know what I mean I mean
big festivals big cigars smoke east mexico
peace rallies waving the flag not that red white and blue shit
my people on some new shit bringing it back never felt right
believing in that how you feel when you carry stress
straight shot put hair on your chest
catch me at it on the late night
trying to get into sumthin
come up on some ends or sumthin
have sumthin to spend on sumthin
uh never tell a copper where I got my bud from
never turn my back on where I got love from
it isnt what you thought it was huh ?
u dont know who you can trust huh?
I already know
tell me what you thinking
tell me whats your reason
you must been drinking
I dont give a fuck I'm from the deep end
wait until tommorrow rest your sleepy hollow head
keep from holding on, drop the beat and blink the moment gone

[Myka 9]
I'm back at it
by my mathmatics
every single antagonist has had it
I blast at it drive by caddilac crack addicts
I mack on the track, attacking them battle cats, tragic
kidnapped, pull out the hatchet
I want to talk to margaret thatcher
and have it be known that I'm a man of stature
I'm not an amateur, when I'm in the zone I capture
the essence of tone, to damage the clones, and vanish alone
a master
every element of chrome flashes
from baretta wetters to berlinetta car crashes, disaster
area
you get the wrong answer to the password question
we carry you out faster
in revolutionary interrogation I be the box
I'm a fine actor
myka 9, rapper
cops, never wake, I levitate
above and beyond the chivalry, a simple liberty, of hate

never tell a copper where I got my bud from
never turn my back on where I got love from
it isnt what you thought it was huh ?
u dont know who you can trust huh?
I already know
tell me what you thinking
tell me whats your reason
you must been drinking
I dont give a fuck I'm from the deep end
wait until tommorrow rest your sleepy hollow head
keep from holding on, drop the beat and blink the moment gone

I'm rollin' on,
that double head like model, open that stretched out body and I'm just yankin' in the throttle
when I know I'm wrong, I'm right I'm with no helmet or goggles
I drink that bottle of hypnotic, start to weeble and wobble
to clicks down, 4 clicks up on the clutch
I'm hitting corners with ground and my knee caps touch
close brush with death, they tried to cut me off with a left turn
make a quick maneuver then I let the rubber burn

ninja art, breaks sims apart
caught a spark in the dark
alley, the car engine starts, this is a different smart
ski masks and black gloves
flip the hour glass back and a half plus
ducati is gassed up
the art of being not noticed, never lost focus
snatched the pebble out your hand before it closes
put it back up in your hand before it opens
meet me on the coast where the sky meets the ocean</pre>
