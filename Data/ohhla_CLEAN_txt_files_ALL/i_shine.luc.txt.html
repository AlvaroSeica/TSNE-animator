I shine grind, bling blind
Better go out and get yours, cause you know I'm getting mine
I shine grind, bling blind
Better ask them boys, I do it to em every time
I shine grind, bling blind
Lucky came up, and got paid off rhymes
I shine grind, bling blind
And I'm down in H-Town, I ain't hard to find

[Lucky]
Well you already know what time it is, cause it's your favorite flower
Lucky caught the game slipping, now I'm fin's to take it over
Ain't no competition out here for me, so Lucky getting that money
And I ain't never hating I'm celebrating, while sipping on some of that Bubbly
Carlos told me Lucky man, it's time you get your shine on
Here's ten thousand dollas, and a contract for you to sign on
I said hold up, man you know them boys been hating me
He said after you drop this album here, they ain't gon be able to say shit
I said oh yeah you sho' right, you know I keep that flow tight
You know I got that do' right, it's Dopehouse that's fo' life
Let's go on ahead and get this money, and put it in they face
Them underground c.d.'s, got me just flipping an Escalade
It's 2000 and 4 shit, that balling out of control shit
That Cadillac do' slamming, I pimp slap a hoe shit
My name Lucky, and I'm getting the paper
I might not be nothing to you, but I'm shit on this label

[Hook]

[Lucky]
Well you can tell, that I've been on the grind
The way, that my damn wheels shine
Lucky do this all the time, and that's why I'ma bling and blind
Bling and blind in your face, when I step up in the place
I be thoed in creased clothes, and a Gucci belt around my waist
Came a long way, but finally I done made it
Survived up in the game, now I'm bout to rearrange it
I've been waiting all my life, I love it it's in my veins
So be proud of a gangsta, when you bubble I do the same
I gotta thank the angels, for giving my life this
Opportunity to be in this position, I'm in
It was already written, for me to do what I'm doing
I'm just living it and sitting back, watching it like a movie
Man that's from the heart, no I can't be denied
I done showed up fa sho', from being out on the grind
Lucky Luciano, popped up from behind
Cause after every storm, out come the sunshine

[Hook]

[Lucky]
Hold up baby girl, let me refill your champagne glass
And uh money ain't nothing to Lucky, cause he stacking major cash
So you boys better handcuff your girl, when I fall up in the club
Yeah they see me valet parked outside, on 22's no Dubs
I walked straight up to the barm he already know what I'm gon say
30 glasses of Hypnotic, and two bottles of Moet
I'm on my way up to the top, and when I leave I'm with a flock
Of bopping hoes coming out they clothes, all focused on my knot
Hey but they won't get a cent, and you know I'm fin to hit
And then I split I've been a pimp, and never had to trick
I'm in the hood but it's all good, my bank look fabulous
I live life like a superstar, and I might buy you a car
This the shit I'm feeling it, I'll get rich and then move to Mars

[Hook - 4x]
