I am the best

[ VERSE 1: Slaine ]
A 1000 grams of uncut to the gut, I don't really gotta go and say no more
But I would put pen to the page every day with my rage since 1984
Rhymes gets crazy raw, what the fuck you think they pay me for?
Toured around the fuckin planet, ain't nobody that can lay me off
Got no love for the law, I don't have no remorse for what I may destroy
I would kill a million people just to save my baby boy
Shootin guns, pushin knives, bloody hands, I clean 'em off
That don't even turn me on, that's just what my penis on
But when the sun sets and the night comes on and the darkness starts descendin
I'm vodka-drinkin, twistin bitches' body parts and mend 'em
I'm a city boy not a pretty boy, girls'll never call him Usher
I'm a alcoholic gettin brain in a bathroom stall in Russia
I'm irrational, international and I'm bent on smash a bar
I'm the asshole of all assholes and I'm bent on smashin a car
At the pace I spit with a face like this they don't have to ask ( ? )
I'm out of control and part of my skull is laughin at you like, 'Ah...ha!'

I am the best, come on say it with me:
Fuck rappers, Slaine is my favorite MC

Fuck you, fuck this, Fuc That, I don't give a fuck about you rappers, dog
I don't care about your bitch, I don't care about your whips, I don't care about you actors, naw
I don't care about your bullshit songs, y'all motherfuckers ain't payin my bills
Where was you when I was slingin 'em krills, takin 'em pills, aimin that steel?
Now I'm makin 'em mills, ain't nothin changed, I'm bangin still
You don't know the pain I feel, I came to kill cause this game is real
I be on my own dick, stand out, I rep mine
Born to win, I'm goin in like it ain't gon' be no next time
East side, west side, north, south, we worldwide
I be gettin 'em girls high, you be keepin 'em girls fly
You be keepin 'em hoes rich, don't snitch cause I don't quit
I'm focused on mo' hits, got yo bitch like 'Oh shit!'
You hopeless, my fo-fifth is so swift it won't miss
The closest to God that you rappers ever gon' get

I am the best, come on say it with me:
Fuck rappers, F.T. is my favorite MC
I am the best, come on say it with me:

This that bigger bang, F.T. and my nigga Slaine
Snowgoons, Scorpions, listen to the Winds of Change
Full speed ahead, we are never switchin lanes
Faster, I'm the master, red dragon spittin flames
MC's hide in fear, new faces, different names
BNB, AOTP, Official Pistol Gang
And we all here, this is our year
Ready for that take-off, captain said we all clear
I'm a ghost, appear only when the fog's near
I'm on drugs, perked up like a dog's ears
Shed a small tear for my dead fam
Fuck with anyone I love and you'se a dead man
I am Redman high and out of my dome, bloke
You a phony, never caught a charge like your phone broke
Mad trees, I smoke on my own oaks
The .44 draw'll lift you out your fuckin ( ? )

Come on say it with me
Reef is my favorite MC
