[Intro: Bronze Nazareth]
The Sun'll fall before I lose...
Yeah... put your dice up on this shit, man...
Throw your bags out, kid, get the shit ready...
Yo... heavy as the Chevy... yo, yo

[Bronze Nazareth]
A blow nicely like Ron Isley
Word dice, we roll, Mice or Men, behold
Ice grill on my '86, slice the pie slightly
Flee or fight me, end up floating up in Bightley
I scope and deliver, rhyme quote Gran Turismo
Drown you in a sea of nickels, sip a fifth slow
Crash around the main bent, straight, no chaser
Silencer on the mic stand, scope no laser
My bitches stand heels, tie up around the calf shields
Leaving movie reels, exquisite ruby hills
Glance and feel the dreams, dirty as Bronson
Head filled with more schemes, than snakes in the garden
I tippy toe like Samurai, slit a throat, don't stand by
Interview in fields of landmines, perform live
During outbreaks, Ebola virus, outline the mic case
Pace gracefully faster than swimmer from shark
I'm known for a spinning darts toward your melenin in dark
Stopping ain't at number one without a shotgun
Platinum platinum, or just Bronze, I'm out, one

[Chorus: Bronze Nazareth]
The Wisemen Approaching, we come from the hills
Leave your science books open, counting all the shells
Approaching a black hoody, Timb size twelve
Escape with the knowledge of self, polish your health

[Phillie]
M.C.'s who believe I'm not king of Detroit
Indestructable, like a bullet proof Rolls Royce
The common choice, I bring fire to the beef
Fuck mic fights, we can get it on in the streets
It's calm and usually peace, beyond the Cuban Linx
I see wild times, of sound mind, be cautious who we meet
Gave a sigh of relief, when Bronze finally got a piece
In a magazine, catastrophe for all wack M.C.'s
New begins, revolutionize, organize the business
Your rap kinds is bygones, so long to pretending
Return of the gutter and grit, the streets have been thirsting for this
Since Re-Birth of a Prince, back to
Niggas who spit, darts that shatter bricks
Grimey as a park bench, built in a cement
Sick like a Cedar Point trip, mobster down
When a roller coast' erupt until now, that's on some old shit

[Chorus]

[Kevlaar 7]
Build my lab with black bricks, sip the liquor frequent
On Sam Cooke nights, my mind sits inside the precent
Indecent as delinquets, running cash to the street pimps
Hethens deal stones, to clones in an oasis
Gates is open, I stole the pens out the hinges
Blair Witch darkness, I need a harness, I travel so far
Park the '84, and saw a scene so raw
Take one, I'm straight, son, we niggas running from our caper
Invade a brother mind, and resurrect, the records crackle
My derelict speech, at the speed of a statue
My face don't move, my words, they show and prove
Disect the earth plates, and exhale a sandstorm
Transform and crash with impacts of 9/11
7 Kevlaar, God, me or the reverend

[Salute]
They say you are what you speak, so I read the truth
Heard the beat in my sleep, wrote my thoughts in the booth
If it's war, I'm on the line, first nigga to shoot
Pulling nines, like a nigga with a pain his tooth
Dark clouds got me feeling like I'm caught in the phase
How I'm living, not the sick kind, bundles and trays
Hustle hard, can't survive, pitching minimum wage
Seeing glory in the middle, but I'm lost in the maze
Blame the concrete jungle for my animal ways
I ain't saying I'm the greatest, but the one in the flesh
Place the game like my blood line was mixed with Artest
Ain't no cameras round here, got the media scared
Just a bunch of niggas hoodied up and fully prepared
Wisemen, so I do, wise things, believe
From the 'jects, no regrets, my respect, no easy
Shit is dope, what make it even harder to cope
Seeing hell, not the light, through the end of the scope

[Chorus]</pre>
