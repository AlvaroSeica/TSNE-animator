[John Legend]
There ain't no time, no time for sorrow
And we ain't got time, no time, awww time to be sad
And maybe the world ain't what it could be
But to understand that, is to know reality
Awwww don't give in (hang on in there)
Awwww I said hang on, hang on in there
Howww many times did you hear your mom and daddy?
Say oh child, I never had it so good
I wanna say thank you, thank you for the start
Cause deep in my soul, I know you did all that you could
I'm just a part of your dreammmm, this I know
But I'll do what ever possible, to make this thing grow
Awwww don't give in (hang on in there)
I said hang on, hang on in there
Awwww now say tomorrow, if you woke up a king
Now tell me just how, would you fix everything?
You walk around complaining, about how things are
But what have you added, to this world so far?
Now check out your mind, and see what the answer is
And tell me just howwww, how much did you give?
Awwww don't give in (hang on in there)
I said hang on, hang on in there, awwww

There are plenty of thinnnngs, still left to live for
A child, a friend, and a wife
They all want to share your life
Ain't that enough to make you want to, hang on?
Ohhhh, hang on, hang onnnnnnnnn
Hang on in there

The sign said, "America - love it or leave it"
Well, has it really come to that?
And besides, I don't want to, and you can't make me love
I've got too many friends, that have shed their blood
I've got too many relatives here born on this land, yeah
So you can't make me leave
I said this is my country, and you can't make me leave
You can't make me love, the way you treat me
Yeahhhhhhhhhh
And you can't make me love yeahh, the way you beat me
Mmmmmm, ohhhh, yeah yeah
I'm gonna hang on
Awwww c'mon

Ando matter you do, or, or what you say
I just wanna let you know, you can't driiiiive me away
I'm gonna hang, hang
I'm gonna hang yeah yeah
I'm not gonna throw up my hands, aww no no
No no no no
I'm not gonna throw up my hands, whoahhoohhhh
And you can't drive me away, from my home land
Gonna hang on, hey yeah yeah
I'm gonna hang on yeah yeah
Aww with the smog from the cars, and so many live we have lost
Hmmm yeah aww still gonna hang on hey yeah yeah
Said no matter, no no no no matter what
I'm gonna hang on
