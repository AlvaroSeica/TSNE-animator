[Intro/Chorus: Flo Rida and woman singer]
You know I know how
to make 'em stop and stare as I zone out
The club can't even handle me right now
Watchin you watchin me, I go all out
The club can't even handle me right now 
(Eh, yea-ei-yeaaah, eh, yea-ei-yeaaah, eh, yea-yeaaaah)
The club can't even handle me right now
(Eh, yea-ei-yeaaah, eh, yea-ei-yeaaah, eh, yea-yeaaaah)
 
[Flo Rida - overlaps chorus]
Ehhaha~! Can't NOTHIN handle me right now!
I see you, D. Guetta! LET'S GET 'IM!
 
[Flo Rida]
Heeeey~! 
I own the light and I don't need no help
Gotta be the feeling that Scarface felt
Stuntin gone wild, can't handle this playa
Life of the club arrogant like YEAH
Talk like money all the girls just melt
One too/one-two many all on me like 12
Look like cash and they all just stare
Bottles, models, standin on chairs
Ball out 'cause that's the business
All out, it's so ridiclous
Zone out, so much attention
Scream out, I'M IN THE BUILDING - HEY!
They watchin, I know this
I'm rockin, I'm rollin
I'm holdin, I know it, you know it
 
[Chorus]
 
[Flo Rida]
Heeeey~!
Still feelin myself, I'm like outta control
Can't stop now, more shots, let's go
Ten more rounds can I get a Kato
Paparazzi tryna make me pose
Came to party 'til I can't no more
Celebrate 'cause that's all I know
Tip the groupies takin off they clothes
Grand finale like Super Bowl
Go - hard, I run the show
That's right, wild out, got money to blow
More light, more ice, when I walk in the door
No hype, do it big all over the globe
Yeah! I said it, go tell it
Confetti, who ready?
I'm ready! You ready? Let's get it!
 
[Chorus w/ Flo Rida repeating "Put your hands up!" during the "Eh yeah" part]
 
[Flo Rida - singing]
You got me watchin now (Yeaaaah)
Got my attention now (Yeaaaah)
Got everybody in the club wantin to know now
I am a ladies' MAN, come and be my lady AND
We can ball, soooo, AHHHHHHH~!
Bring ya body here, let me switch up ya atmosphere
Take you up out of the club and up in my new lim' (Yeaaaah)
Fly you all around the world
Whatchu want, baby girl?
Are you ready to go, NOOOOOOOOOW?
 
[Chorus w/ Flo Rida repeating "Put your hands up!" during the "Eh yeah" part]
 
[Outro]
Put your hands up!
Let's celebrate now!
Put your hands up!
You know who shut 'em down!</pre>
