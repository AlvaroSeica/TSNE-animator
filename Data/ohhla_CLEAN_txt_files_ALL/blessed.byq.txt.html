[ScHoolboy Q]
Uh, yo-yo, yo-yo, yo-yo, uh
What is life for a nigga like me?
Living out his backpack every night, needing a new place to sleep
But this is now, nigga

One's for the money, two for the bitches
Three to get ready cause I feel finally did it
Four's for the jealous rapper mad because he finished
Turn that motherfucker to a critic
Man, I got so much shit up on my plate dog
I was hanging on them corners late, pockets wasn't straight bitch
I ain't gon' make it at this rate dog, know what I'm saying?
Nigga praying up to God just hoping that he hear a nigga
I know the world got more problems and it's much bigger
but I figured I'd get some shit up off my chest
To all my niggas I would die for
Load my pistol up, go out and war for
To all my niggas that will never make it out the streets
Fuck it, keep going hard, don't let 'em see you weak
To all my niggas first time stepping in the pen
Read a book and exercise, keep your spirit in
To all my niggas that's gon' fuck around and die today
Take our hats off, bow our heads and let us pray
Just wanna say, ay

[Chorus 2X: ScHoolboy Q]
Stay blessed my nigga, blessed my nigga
Really think about it could be worse my nigga
Don't stress my nigga, yes my nigga
We all blessed my nigga

[ScHoolboy Q]
Uh, now how the fuck I'm 'posed to say this?
You see my nigga just lost his son while I'm here hugging on my daughter
I grip her harder, kiss her on the head as I cry for a bit
Thinking of some bullshit to tell him like, it'll be okay
You'll be straight, it'll be aight
Well fuck that shit, whatever you need, yo I got it
Whether it's money or some weed or putting in work, fuck it then I'm riding
Uh, you know what's up, but now a nigga couldn't stick around
Told myself that after y'all moved that I'd be a fucking fool
to be living by the street rules
Fuck police tattoos, that happens when you ditch school
But anyway, keep the faith, stay strong bruh, remain solid bruh
Keep playing ball cause it's the only way up out it bruh, a nigga proud of ya
Tell Floyd to enjoy his newborn seed
I'll have whatever he needs, we the last of a dying breed
Live life, smoke trees
See how far we've come, but most, I'm sorry for your son

[Chorus 2X]

[Ab-Soul]
And you ain't gotta shed no tear
I'll be everywhere and I'ma always be right here
I ain't forgot those years
I'll be everywhere, but I'ma always be right here

[Kendrick Lamar] + (ScHoolboy Q)
Living in a premature place... wait
Never grow to see the pearly gates... break
every time a bullet detonate... dates
of obituary, carry crates
of a scary picture with a family member that relate
to ya, in December you was finna pin another case
on your record in a stolen Expedition, play it safe
As the record spinning, you was hearing angels entertain
Every pun intended, that was wicked coming from your brain
Recognize you listened and you didn't hit the block again
That's because the minute after you had moved you would be slain
Open up another chapter in the book and read again
Story of a gun-clapper really tryna make a change
Everybody ain't (blessed my nigga)
Yes my nigga, you're blessed, take advantage, do your best my nigga
Don't stress, you was granted everything inside this planet
Anything you imagine, you possess my nigga
You reject these niggas that neglect your respect
for the progress of a baby step my nigga
Step, step my nigga, one, two, skip, skip
Back, back, look both ways, pull it off the hip
Blast at anybody say that you can't flip
this crack into rap music, every other zip/.zip
is a track, get used to it, get it off quick
Come back, give back to the city you've built
That's that, don't trip, see money, fuck niggas dog
It ain't nothing but a bunch of fuck niggas dog
In a minute everybody gon' be winning
Put a little faith in it, then recognize that we all

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
