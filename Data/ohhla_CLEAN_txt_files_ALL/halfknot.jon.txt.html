Yeah, check it
Back up on the block with a half a knot
looking everywhere and I don't see no cops
only seventeen and had these roll locked
that quiet little kid from the mean old blocks
got the fuck out, rocked hiphop the fuck out
haters say I quietly snuck out
you must now be grindin' your teeth
speakin' to me like what now?
You want a whole what?
Oh you flowin' for bucks now
You knew who it was, new school with a buzz
Style cool as crocodile playin' wild in clubs now
we wildin' the fuck out, smilin' the whole time
behind all the blood,sweat, bottles of broke wine
ounces of grass passed aroused to the fast path
we bounced to the truth, show up with the cash last
nigga, pass that glass, cold liquor killed a warm heart
on start we gon' smash 
Back up on the block with a half a knot
looking everywhere and I don't see no cops
Bridgetown still finna clean your box
Same quiet little kid from the mean old blocks 
Yeah, I got back up in the team, dreams fallin' in place
but it ain't what it seems when it's all in ya face
they say I'm naive cuz I called them a fake
but mama said under uncut grass is a snake
he used to stay trimmed, the fake lights made my day dim
ain't been since the Knicks beat Heat in game six
I learned the game quick, same with the flame spit
cuz the game ain't been the same since I changed it
no I didn't stutter sucker, I said changed it
cuz once you hear this kid you feel the change quick
and you gon' taste six, feedin' the dirt box
verses will burn spots, rockin' the earth's core
you ready for verse four? It's crushin' the third rock
stopped by the earth store, blazin' that purple
kush push the 'octadoc' Oc's the worst though
no subrockin' the block, shockin' the circle 
Back up on the block with a half a knot
looking everywhere and I don't see no cops 
back at it with a bad habit I can't drop
the flash Anderson ad to my camp stopped
suckers just quit when the break got chopped
dropped the drums out hot, hiphop rocked the fuck out
blocks got lots to bump now, it still ain't dumbed down
your tongue just randomly guns down the young now
Aloe Blacc back on his run now, Bridgetown still ain't come down
Ol' Ex cuttin' the checks yes they flexin' the butts now
K-M still gettin' touchdowns, another one of 'em scores again
making boys from men, pourin' blood, sweat and tears out the pores again
it's like they born to win, or doubt denyin' their losses
if not they vendin' the victory sweet as Hickory sauces
spinnin' Dickory Dock, you're not gettin' the props
we rock the box viciously Doc rotisserie hot hot 
Back up on the block with a half a knot
looking everywhere and I don't see no cops
Bridgetown still finna clean your box
Same quiet little kid from the mean old blocks</pre>
