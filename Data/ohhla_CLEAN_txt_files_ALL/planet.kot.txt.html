Life ain't funny, when you ain't got no money
And that clock strikes 4:20, and you wanna get high
No bills get sent when you can't pay the rent
Everyday I get bent yo so i can get by
I'm moanin' on and on kickin' lits from beyond, planet budtron
Bso stay on
Kottonmouth Kings got them dope tracks
1605 yes they got my back
I'm buckin' your boots cuz ya smoke crack
I get the munchies and i eat a greasy bigmac
Find me smoked out, ain't unlikely
That's why my homies call me D the L-O-C
You'll catch me at a party deep in O.C.
Representin that punk rawk stylee
When im on the mic i make the crowd move
To escape reality i bust my own groove
Ladies on the floor say your so smooth
I wink my eyes, and replied
They says real cool
Life ladies don't understand me
Said to call my sign to be an anarchy
Skate in my hand cuz im like that
i bust to surf and off the curb cuz im real phat
Life ain't funny, when you ain't got no money
And that clock strikes 4:20, and you wanna get high
I'm moanin on and on kickin lits from beyond, planet budtron
Bso stay on

Well, I'm D-Loco a fly shit
Smoke bud with the king click
Don't trip, but addicted
Full flown, can't stop smokin' that homegrown
I gotta phat blown acre out in Riverside
Hallbrook locals the Kings reside
E-Loc, G-Mac, Big Hoss in the pen, BJ, Guido, and my boy Efrin
I go coocoo for coco, chocolate thai, smoke bud till i die
You wonder why, stay high like a black fly
Then i stop, buzzin' like a busy is ah ba ba ba

Life ain't funny, when you ain't got no money
And that clock strikes 4:20, and you wanna get high
No bills get sent when you can't pay the rent
Everyday i get bent yo so i can get by
I'm moanin' on and on kickin' lits from beyond, planet budtron
Bso stay on

Saint Vicious pay attention let me educate
I put a tapper in the gut of this legislate
Push the tap, and i watch the sewer drain out
Lies lies lies, what i've been talkin about
Well not old school like i use to (used to)
Kottonmouth Kings just broke through (move fool)
Psychedelic hip hop punk rock shit
So back the hell up and get smacked in your lip
Saint don't quit im from the old school
5 block didn't have a pipe to skate to
Lawns wet, rail slide, real smooth
No skate mall but it was still cool

Life ain't funny, when you ain't got no money
And that clock strikes 420, and you wanna get high
No bills get sent when you can't pay the rent
Everyday i get bent yo so i can get by
I'm moanin' on and on kickin' lits from beyond, planet budtron
Bso stay on
