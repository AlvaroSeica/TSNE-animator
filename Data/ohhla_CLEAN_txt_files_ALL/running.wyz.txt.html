Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
Everybody get up, everybody get up
Throw your hands up, throw your hands up
Everybody get up, everybody get up
Throw your hands up, throw your hands up
Everybody get up, everybody get up
Throw your hands up, throw your hands up
Everybody get up, everybody get up
You can't keep running away you've gotta hold on

When I sit back and think about my past
I think about all the times you laughed
I think about the times you let me down
Time's made me a lot stronger now
But still I feel afraid
Why am I paying for mistakes you made
Broken heart from a broken home
I'm so sick of being alone
I'm tired of running away from this
Playing a game that's dangerous
Some turn with the world, some watch it twist
Put you hands up if your life's like this

[Chorus (2X)]

As I stand alone again, wondering when
All this pain will end
Some days I cry, some days I hide
So much pain that's built inside
My so called life as an empty man
Now a-days I don't even know who I am
You tried to walk away to test my limits
If this is your world then I don't want to live in it
I can't stand the way I'm portrayed
And I'm so sick of being afraid
I can't stand these games you play
Throw your hands up if your life's this way

[Chorus (2X)]</pre>
