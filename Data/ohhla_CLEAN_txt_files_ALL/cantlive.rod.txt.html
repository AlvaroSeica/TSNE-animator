Typed by: Cno Evil

[Intro: Harry Nilsson "Without You" sample]
No I, can't forget this evening, or your, face as you were leaving
But I, guess that's just the way, the story goes
You always smile, but in your eyes, your sorrow shows, yes it shows
No I, can't forget tomorrow, when I, think of all my sorrow
When I had you there, but then I let you go
And now it's only fair, that I should let you know, what you should know

[Chorus: Harry Nilsson "Without You" sample]
I can't live, if living is without you
I can't live, I can't give anymore
I can't live, if living is without you
I can't give, I can't give anymore

[Li-Mouse]
Understand me, I can't live without you in my family
If you weren't there, I'd live, every day angrily
And that, my friends, would be tragedy
Pose as queen, and me, as your majesty
Conquer any obstacles, in the path we have to take
Love measures beyond what even math couldn't calculate
Fuck just a little bit, I want the whole thing
Under my wings, me with you, ain't a fling
I indulge, in my impulse to love you
That's why it's so difficult to let go, when I hug you
Drive pass the candy shop, and come to my factory
I got enough sweets to fill you, and the world, practicaly
I can't give anymore what I possess
As you resess, I'm sure to urge you to progress
What stress? When you lay your head on my chest
It keeps my life moving every time you say I'm the best

[Chorus]

[Cno Evil]
I love the way you be smiling with your teeth
And the sweet honey taste of lips that I'm receiving
I'm achieving in believing, no more grieving
Relief afters years of deceiving
And misleading, but now my miss is leaving
I can't live without you, it's like I stopped breathing
Relieving of my burdens and distress, but now retrieving
Perceiving to that knowledge in which I'm conceiving
I can see again, blend the memories of my girlfriend
That descended from heaven to contend with them
Days I spend, when we fight, we quick to mend
No pretends, we comprehend, amend to the end
On her I depend, only her I'll defend
I recommend to apprehend and then trascend
My heart that I lend, my hand; I extend
Inspirational relationship, starting new trends

[Chorus]

[Cno Evil]
Nothing's ever too late, that's why life is long
No matter how many rights you make, there's always a wrong
I look at my scars, that remind me of my pain
Those are there to prevent it from happening again
Raindrops on a sunny day? It must be my tears
Felt like a few days? It must of been years
The chapter ends on a sour note, but inspires the author
To tighten up his mind, write the next one sharper
You can't change the past, what's done is done
It still shocks my body up and down like a stun gun
I still think day and night that she was the one
My mind was light, but my heart weighed a ton
It's no more fun, and it's no more joy
Just like a gun is not meant to be a toy
You can't play with danger, I thought you knew
No more anger, I can't live if living is without you

[Chorus 2X]

[Outro: Cno Evil]
Yeah, those are our testaments
To this thing called love
You take the good, you take the bad, that's how it is
Then you realize you just can't live
For better or for worse, you just can't
Try it sometime, see what happens
Drop it</pre>
