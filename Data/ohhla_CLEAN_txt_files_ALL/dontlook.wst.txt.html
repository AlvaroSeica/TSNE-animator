[Chorus: Mos Def - singing]
Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Fly like an eagle, whatever you do
Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Spread your wings, aerial

[Lupe Fiasco]
Head to the sky, wings raised and
she's about to fly and take her place in
out there in the stars when she leaves the ground
She'll see a broken heart if she turns around
But ain't no going back, this is how it must be
He told her she'll be burned alive, she just told him "trust me"
If funerals are beautiful, this ugly
Knowing this he told her you wouldn't leave me if you loved me
And he knows that because he knows her
Hard to hide his feelings as it engulfs her
Now she's a bright blaze, light rays
are shooting out, a phoenix on fire burning up the nightscape
So let's hear it for our heroine
Applaud as her spirit just flies into the never-end
One closed chapter, it opens up another part
So this is more like the end, question mark

[Chorus]

[Kanye West]
Don't let me hold you back, I only hold you back
We on a dead-end street, this block has got a cul-de-sac
So fly baby, my baby so high
Sometimes it's so hard to say bye
We made it from the alley straight up to the ballet
We pulled up to the valet, we'll teach our daughter ballet
We'll raise us a Beyonce, maybe she'll be a Halle
You would've been the best mom, I would have been the 'Ye
You see it all in my veins like varicose
I know that's very gross but we getting very close
to our end, though I killed most with a pen
Soon as this flow end, I'ma let Mos begin

[Chorus]

[Big Sean]
How could you do it?
How could you do it?
Okay now baby, here we go, we go, no baby, me go
You got my heart, baby this what it beat for
I give it all, walk as far as my feet go
What you mean "me go", why can't it be "we go"?
What happens when people turn to tears, huh?
Dreams turn to memories and weeks turn to years, huh?
Been standing in the same spot for a couple of weeks
Give me my feelings back, wish love came with a couple of receipts
Man, our vacation was coming next week
Girl I swear you was a trip, let's make it a couples' retreat
How could my girl do this to me?
Woke up to a note saying "the world did this to me"
Now I'm testing, one two, reporting live from the rubble
Drinking all I can so I can turn to fire when I hug you
One, two, three, four, five models on the double
Give me head all at once, look like they line in a huddle
But it's not even half the feeling as hearing you shine, you know I love you
Shedding tears every day, and I'm tired of lying in these puddles
I ask why sometimes like a fucking vowel
Been hitting trees every day like a fucking owl
Trying to get high enough to cut the clouds
of the +Phoenix Sun+ to Nash it out, I mean ash it out
So I could see you smile, I-I know you can see me now
