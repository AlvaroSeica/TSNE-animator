AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!
Way down in New Orleans
Yeaaaahhhhh, I met this old lady
She said she'd teach me about Voodoo
She said she knew about Voodoo (Voodoo)
She said she'd teach me about the Voodoo
She said she knew about Voodoo (Voodoo)
She had an old doll (Voodoo)
She had a long shiny needle (Voodoo)
She held the doll in the air, it looked kinda like me (Voodoo)
She took the needle, stuck it in it's eye! AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!
My eye, bitch! 

[Break: Beatmaster V]
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH HA!!

[Ice-T]
Now I'm still in the room with this crazy bitch
And she still had the doll
She said I'll teach you about the Voodoo (Voodoo)
You wanna learn about Voodoo? (Voodoo)
She said I'll teach you about the.. Voodoo (Voodoo)
She said she knew about.. Voodoo
She held the doll in her hand (Voodoo)
She had some long shiny scissors (Voodoo)
She said some magic words (Voodoo)
The doll looked more and more like me (Voodoo)
She held the doll in the air (Voodoo)
She took the scissors, cut off all it's fingers!
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!
My finger, bitch!

[Break: Beatmaster V]
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!
Voodoo, Voodoo, Voodoo, Voodoo
Voodoo, Voodoo, Voodoo, Voodoo

[Ice-T]
So if you're ever down in New Orleans
Yeaaahhh, you might meet an old lady
She might have a doll, it might look like you
Don't ask about the.. Voodoo (Voodoo)
Stay away from Voodoo (Voodoo)
Leave alone the.. Voodoo (Voodoo)
Motherfuck the.. Voodoo</pre>
