OVO MMG GBE
You already know..

[Chorus: Lil' Reese]
At the top it's just us nigga
But I don't really trust niggas
OTF it's just us nigga
But I don't really trust niggas
GBE we don't fuck with niggas
At the top where you see us nigga
Since a youngin bitch we been them niggas
Since a youngin bitch we been them niggas

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Michael Jackson got them fiends just like Thrilla
Two door Maybach clean, smokin' on killa
You a stranger talkin' and I don't feel it
If I don't know your momma, I'mma make him feel it
Heavy Armor-All you know I wanna shine
Bitch I need it all, each and every dime
Photos taken, four door Maybach I know you hatin'
Stayin' with women from Staten Island my flows so flagrant
We the realest, pistol concealed my percentage
Higher than yours, Cash Money I see no limits
Port of Miami then I drop Trilla
Ex dope dealer worth 8 figures

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Drake]
Just got back from Turks &amp; Caicos hoes all at the villa
Only nigga making albums with no fucking filla
New deal on the table look like bout like 10 milla
Shout my lawyer man he a contract killa
You know 305 Ricky that's my fucking nigga
Did this shit right here Baka, Preme, Styles and Gilla
Did this shit right here for Reese, Sosa, Fredo, Durk!!
You let Drizzy get a verse you gon get this work
Yeah, at the top it's just us nigga
Yeah, that's why I don't really trust niggas
See my family and the money is a must nigga
All the fame and all the pussy is just a plus nigga
Yeah

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Lil' Reese]
Since a youngin bitch we been them niggas
A small circle with no new niggas
Cause I don't really trust niggas
GBE its just us nigga
And she just wanna fuck with us
So much kush keep me stuck nigga
In other words high as fuck nigga
Life's a movie I'm a priceless picture
400 for the belt nigga
Right or wrong you get left nigga
For that bag you get left nigga
For my niggas you get left nigga

[Chorus]

[Verse 4: Rick Ross]
I love this beat, ah man I'm finna go bad
I pay for pussy, ah man she gotta be bad
She fuck with me, that bitch know I'm 'bout to buy them bags
Beef with me, fuck boy bout to go out back!
I woke up countin' money, make confetti fall
Type of money, she fuck me she gotta fuck us all
Them other boys well known for letting niggas starve
We eating good, not my 40 Wing Stops
My new home look like it's Al Capone
My new bitch look like she in them folds
My new watch look like I had a stole
Barry Weiss told me I'm gold, God forgives I don't
Me and Drizzy like The Beatles nigga
Same ones hating, wouldn't wanna be them niggas
We let 'em stare but we don't see them niggas
We don't see them niggas!

[Chorus]</pre>
