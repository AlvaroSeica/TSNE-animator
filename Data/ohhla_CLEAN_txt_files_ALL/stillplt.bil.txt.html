[Hook: Mr. 3-2 - 2x]
Still platinum in the ghetto, what you tal'n bout
From the hoods on the block, where they hustle nonstop
Still platinum in the ghetto, getting a whole lot of change
Everybody know my name, cause I'm up on the game

[Billy Cook]
I'm Billy Cook Supastar, living legend baby
Rolling Mercedes baby, getting paid baby
Still platinum in the ghetto, so I shine daily
R&amp;B Gangsta overseas, bank accounts baby
My manifold's bungalow, living lavish like a king
Heir to the throne baby, kiss the pinky ring
Speed boats jet ski's, and I own my own beaches
White sands black diamonds, surrounded by dime pieces
I'm a classy young G, with private jets I'm so cold
Worth about a few million in stock, I'm so thoed
I'm the truth not the shit, call me Picasso
B.M.G. be the way, and the click and the code

[Hook - 2x]

[Billy Cook]
Billy Cook the ice king, went from crumbs to bricks
B.M.G. 1965, done busted open in the mix
Waterfalls pool parties, it's Mardi Gras everyday
Sipping lemonade, and martinis in the shade
See I practice being rich, and not broke as a joke
So when haters peep the real, they slip and choke
I stick out like a sore thumb, and I roll thirty deep
Got models on the rooftop, toting that heat
Eric D get the whip, grab the steel
Big T handle the bomb, it's getting way too real
It's the R&amp;B Gangsta, that them niggaz unleashed
Don't talk just listen, you understand capish

[Hook - 2x]

[Billy Cook]
Still platinum in the ghetto, whoooo is he
R&amp;B legend, no doubt
Still platinum in the ghetto, whoooo is he
And I roll, with the King of the South
Still platinum in the ghetto, who-who is he
R&amp;B legend, no doubt
Still platinum in the ghetto, got 'em saying who is he
And I roll, with the King of the South

[Hook - 2x]

(*talking*)
Ha-ha yeah, I'm still platinum in the ghetto
Whether you believe it or not, your boy Billy Cook Supastar
And I'm talking mad shit, yeah ha-ha
I'm the King of R&amp;B down South, that's right
And I roll and I rep, that B.M.G. 1-9-6-5
Let me define that for you, Battiste Muzic Group 1965
That's right, it's gon be a good year baby believe that</pre>
