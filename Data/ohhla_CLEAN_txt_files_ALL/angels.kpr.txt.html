First came the wings, then the angel. His spirit actually appeared to you?

[Intro: Killah Priest]
Word, know what I'm sayin?
Straight up. I gotta talk to ya'll about angels right now.
(Don't be buggin) I dunno if you be knowing that you having them all around you?
Protecting you, angles, just wanna talk about angels.
Something different we ain't discussed

[Chorus: Killah Priest]
Yo, Angels (Angels) Eiloheim in the skies, fly with eagle wings
Angels (Angels) Eiloheim in the skies, fly with eagle wings
Angels (Angels) Eiloheim in the skies, fly with eagle wings
Angels (Angels) Eiloheim in the skies, fly with eagle wings

[Killah Priest]
First Genesis mislead us, fist of all we have to discuss who is the us
Who helped form the man from out of the dust
Who helped make the lands and fill the sea up? It was us
In greater form, we helped create a storm
That take newborns and embrace them in their arms
They hold hearts, and play god his favourite song
Touch the heart, and make it warm
They taught the preachers, they sit on ether
Some say they touch women in the bleachers give them seizures
They fight demons, they like creeping
Angels, they govern kingdoms
Yo c'mon

[Chorus]

[Killah Priest]
Angels, they bought the message from the heavens
Confused man about immaculate conception
They dressed in all black in their presence
They know the answers to mans questions, while he's questing
The cherub form in the jeroboam
Man should cherish them, but don't worship them
Why? Cus they here to service men
Angels, they walk with plain clothes never let their wings show

[Chorus]

[Killah Priest]
Angels, in which you imprisoned, show us visions
Play with the children, introduce us to women
They surround leaders, and politicians
Acknowledged by Christians, followed by wisdom you can hear them
They could be around you right now, sitting with their wings hidden
The ghosts of the night drifting
Float on the night skipping
Put my soul in conviction
Just listen to the energy, channels into the angels
C'mon

[Chorus]</pre>
