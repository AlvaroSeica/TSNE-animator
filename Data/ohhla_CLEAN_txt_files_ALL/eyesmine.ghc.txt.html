Song:   These Eyes Of Mine
Typed by: LeGtBaLLa@aol.com

{O'Dell} (Chorus}x2
Givin yo lil sins away 
Tryin to find a better day
I keep seeing all this through these eyes of mine

{O'Dell}

These eyes of mine have seen
So many messed up things
I really don't know why 
Women live that life
If you need a child to make him stay
You need to send his ass on his way
I see it on the streets everyday 
Single mother tryin make her way

{Spade}

Girl I'm sick of seeing you like this
Get your act together you ain't gotta live like this
Girl you pregnant and you still smoking, what you trying to do poison your
seed ?
God bless you with a child and you give him praise with your weed
And you still run the streets thinkin that your friends is your friends 
But tryin to move on and watch them stab you in yo back in the end
And all I can tell you I hope the best for yo unborn seed 
But I'm goin to let you know that I don't like the shit that I see 

{Chorus}x2

Givin yo lil sins away 
Tryin to find a better day
I keep seeing all this through these eyes of mine

{Valario}

These eyes of mine has seen so many fucked up thangs
Lil girls tryin to be women play they self in the game
My eyes can see that you move fast 
You figure if you please this nigga you can come up on some loose cash
You had a baby by this nigga, he ain't trippin off you
He to busy paper chasing, so where that leave you ?
Got another mouth to feed now 
My eyes can see that you regret everyday you ran the streets now
And I can see yo lil sister walkin the same path
Take any nigga with some paper, and he'll be up in that ass
My eyes can see why niggaz call females bitches and hoes
Cause you sale yo precious bodies, cause you sale your precious soul

Tryin to find a better way 

Givin yo lil sins away 
Tryin to find a better day
I keep seeing all this through these eyes of mine</pre>
