I THINK WE'RE READY FOR THE
THE SECOND INSTALLMENT OF SLOPPY LOVE JINGLE
Roll it - ACTION~!!

[Travie McCoy]
Okay, continued - what's next up on the menu?
Hmm, maybe I should crack a joke
Attack and ask her if she smokes
Cause I can't seem to find my matches
And that could break the ice but
I'm a bad actress with three lighters I acquired the previous night
And there I was, do or die
She was approximately five feet away from my frame
So I decided to take it in stride, swallow my pride
Tellin her my name like "Hello miss, my name is Travis
Just a ordinary cat, I'm into art and fuzzy rabbits
Kinda smart with a big heart, and you can have it!
I see you find that funny
I'd love to buy you a drink but I got bent and spent my money
But would you kindly accept a raincheck?
Perhaps some deep chit chat?"
She didn't think twice nodded her head and said "I'm with that"
(AWESOME!) "By the way you got some matches?"
She's like "No, but there's a lighter right in front of you"
(Stupid, stupid, stupid!) And now we both gigglin
This girl's so crazy, got my gullet jigglin
Fiddlin with my feelings like an out of tune piano
Like I'm on ritalin
The way she's got my undivided attention
dismissin any thoughts of lettin this one get away</pre>
