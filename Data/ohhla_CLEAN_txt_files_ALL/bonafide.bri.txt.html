It's a Brilliant beat
 
[Verse 1]
She a bonafide bad bitch she play to win
She don't need help from nobody else she get it in
That's what I love about this bitch she a go getter
She a real hustla she ain't no gold digger
Expensive taste she got it all she ain't no broke bitch
I love the way them jeans huggin' on her she so thick
She a mutha fuckin' bonafide 
She keep it 100 percent she don't ever lie
On the one this bitch know how to do it all
She havin' money all she know how to do is ball
She a freak she know how to work that pussy for me
When I get it up she gon' put that pussy on me
 
[Chorus] x2
She a bonafide bad bitch
She got money and got expensive habits
She do it on her own she don't need nobody
She do it on her own she don't need nobody
 
[Verse 2]
She independent she bad enough on her own
She don't need nobody else to be dependent on
She lookin' like she grown, money lookin' like its long
She wettin' up the bed talkin' dirty on the phone
She a real bitch no flaws
Knockin' on my door no panties no bra
She into the finer things
Into designer things, nail polish and diamond rings
She bad and she know it
She don't let nothin' get in the way she stay focused
She a bonafide bad bitch
Roll of money and got expensive habits
BRILL
 
[Chorus] x2</pre>
