[Lil' Rob]
Hey what's up homeboy
Lil' Rob back up in this motherfucker homey
Kicking back with Royal T, Frank V, Yogi, Silencer, and True Breed
Spanish Fly and Point Blank
Putting it down ese
Yeah
Mexicano style
Simon
That's how we do it

[Lil' Rob]
San Diego, Southern California that's what I represent
Lil' Rob be the fucking baddest, Mexicano born with the badness
Putting it down for the Brown, putting it down for my town
La colo√±a, holding the corona from SD to Arizona
Que onda, chichonas, nalgonas, cabronas
Where you at, Lil' Rob be the fucking bomba
Smoking up the mota, watching out for chotas
Black guys on my ass again cuz I'm that crazy Mexican

[Yogi]
I remember how it all began
I used to bust raps to my East County friends
Now back then, you knew I couldn't stop that rap
I used to rock the instrumentals while my homies scratched
I wrote my first rap at the age of thirteen
Grew tall and got hairy, now I got a goatee
I was the homey, I know you used to know me
I put it down in my town, I know you've heard of Yogi
Busting off shots, running from the cops
I don't plan to stop until I see you vatos drop

[Chorus x2: Yogi]
Busting off shots, running from the cops
We don't plan to stop until we see you vatos drop
Busting off shots, running from the cops
We don't plan to stop until we see you vatos drop

[Royal T]
Homey uno D, by three pack a bandit
Five o'clock gravy homey can you fucking handle it
From SD to LA, back to SD
Fool you know my name, that vato Royal T

[Point Blank]
Lowriders hopping, records still be popping
Keep the spot piping hot until you motherfuckers drop
No joke, I go for broke straight O-Side repping
Busting like automatic weapons at rap sessions
For real, lyrics are steel, bitches scream my name
Talk shit and feel the flame, Point Blank in the brain
What

[Silencer]
Stick em out, knock em out
Let you know what I'm all about
Silencer with the rap
San Diego on the map
Stick em all, kill em all
Guarenteed to buck em all
This is how it's gonna be
None of you can fuck with me

[OG Spanish Fly]
OG Spanish Fly aka Maniac
Representing Low Profile 2000
Biatch

[Chorus x2]

[Frank V]
I stay ready, so I never get ready
On the grind all day, I stay committed to confetti
Hitting corners slow, chopping it up on the celly
Iced out, cooler than Arthur Fonzerelli
Rims spinning, bitches grinning at my spinning
Haters hating and I got the pork chops tail-gaiting
Trunk full of cash, a pound in the dash
Nine milli on stash, got no choice but to blast

[Bandit]
I don't give a fuck fool I'm coming in how I'm leaving
You don't want none of this, I'll leave y'all bitches half breathing
Bitch I ain't teasing, I'll lift your soul when I spit
I'm a Southwest lowride cold blue Crip
Now y'all gonna trip, but I don't give a fuck no more
I'm on the news kicking down your concert door
Just letting y'all know I handle everything in the streets
Man you're lucky that I'm whooping your ass over this beat
Look at you drowning in your own shit
Low Profile got style and we don't quit
This here a hit, you gang bang, we gang bang too
You bring the heat, we bring the heat and disrespect you, disrespect you
Look at you drowning in your own shit
Low Profile got style and we don't quit
This here a hit, you gang bang, we gang bang too
You bring the heat, we bring the heat and disrespect you, we disrespect you</pre>
