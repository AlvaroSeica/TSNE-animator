[Diabolic]
I two-step with Lucifer &amp; ever since I started dancin
I walked a fine line between Einstein and Charles Manson
Stopped this famine with my stomach growlin'
Like someone shoutin' a hundred thousand times louder than thunder poundin'
Fuck around and I'll punch your mouth in
I'm king of the mountain with my life in this project like its public housing
Countin' on the fact that I'll firebomb entire songs
I won't stop till the world is inside my palm like Viacom
Diabolic, I'll supply the higher wattage
Fire fiber optic wire till you acquire some kind of knowledge
Cause life made me grow wiser than old timers 
Hot headed like the Ghost Rider behind a slow driver
Sole survivor, flowin' lavas like second nature
So don't test it's best to save your breath like respirators
I'll throw a punch at your ribs that gives your lungs asthma
And hash'll pourin' out your guts faster than Dutch Masters
Drunk bastard pass the point of no return 
Like Denzel trickin' Ethan Hawk in to smokin' sherm
Judgment overturned, holdin' court like Mordecai
Mortalize when I make statues bleed and portraits cry
I'll go to war for mine, rebel army guard the border
I'm in the trenches barkin' orders like I'm Sergeant Slaughter
Pray to Jesus H. for mercy and plead your case
Cause on the front lines you dead the second that you see my face
 
[Immortal Technique]
This is the frontline this is the dead-zone
barely alive or in a box is how you head home
This is the frontline this is the life that I chose
I thought I told you muthafuckas to lock and load
[Diabolic]
This is the frontline this is the dead-zone
barely alive or in a box is how you head home
This is the frontline this is the life that I chose
I thought I told you muthafuckas to lock and load
 
[Immortal Technique]
They said that success of my music was theoretic
But my revenge is sweet enough to murder diabetics
Eugenics Procter &amp; Gamble credit racial science
Couldn't produce a more aggressive intellectual giant
Nephilim bury em' with the bullets left in them
My heart is blacker than the children of Thomas Jefferson
Blacker than back in the days of the tar and featherin'
A cancerous endocrine, the eagle-less American
The hatchet and the sticks, the fascists emblem
You can call it conspiracy theory, I don't give a mother fuck
You could get your mother fucked
National security's a code word for cover up
Hold that down
I look at character; never let the color get to ya
I got white revolutionaries like Muslims in Chechnya
Percussion thumpin' like the Russian mafia over ya
But even they know what it's like when you fightin' for Sloboda
So whether Slavic or Islamic vodka/gin tonic
Drunken fantasies are cool son, but here's the grim logic
You niggas want to play industry and start to be rich
Until they fuck you for millions like Paul McCartney's bitch
My lions [lines] live inside a box like Jumanji
Sikh niggas there to stab you up like Indira Gandhi
So never desecrate the space in which I meditate
My thoughts rip through tank armored metal plates
And start to resonate to the spot where Moses caused the sea to separate
The place where the prophet Muhammad started to levitate
The exact moment where Jesus rose dead awake
And Siddhartha became the Buddha that regenerates
Half a bar over but I bring it home colder than dead soldiers
Soul controller holder of knowledge so fuck dianetics
I'm like the whole library in Kemet with Annunaki genetics

This is the frontline this is the dead-zone
