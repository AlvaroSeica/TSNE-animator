[Chorus - T.I.]
I never let you down, I'm a shine on sight
Keep your mind on your grind and off of mines, alright? (right)
Hard I'm a ball on them squares I float
And quarter million dollar cars everywhere I go
I know, in the lead it may seem he might be
But no matter what they doin, they don't do it like me
Like a G, I hold it down for the town I'm at
In a flash like that, recognize I'm back

[Verse 1 - T.I.]
Strike a match, catch a fire, any moment I decide
That's enough of all your lies, boy your buzz just died
Step inside, super fly to the shoes in they Coupe
Then exit out with all the bitches like we always do
My desire to retire grow with every new group
'Cause these guys just don't ride like my nigga you too
Tight jeans, funny haircut, dancin on the screen
There's a drought of real niggaz in the game so it seems
Just pretend and holla pimpin give the shit a black eye (eye)
Next he say he trappin in my head, I'm like "why?"
Be yourself, you ain't got a pimp bone in your body
I can tell ya ain't never bought a ki or caught a body
Nigga probably just seen Wayne, Gucci Mane, me and Boosie all go to prison
Now they flip their whole image, nigga trippin
Listen dude, for you that ain't in the cards
Think the power is in the gun but overall it's in your heart
Nowadays I don't know what's up with niggaz in the A
Guess he think he in the game but he really in the way
Violatin, I was havin conversations in the joint
With cats who done it and I promised I'd put you on point
I'm disappointed in you dog, you ain't hold it down at all
But I ain't goin in your jaw, I'm just goin to show ya how to ball
Standin tall through the storm, on the yard or in the dorms
Cats in prison who expectin me to represent for 'em

[Chorus]

[Verse 2 - T.I.]
Strike a match, catch a fire, see T.I. add gas
What's a Molotov cocktail that never break a glass?
Scary ass nigga wanna come for me you better bring it
I ain't mad, I forgive 'em, God I know they ain't mean it
Yeah I seen it all before, hey, IÂ’m poppin and they ain't
Rack they brain tryin to think of how to stop it and they can't
Ain't that lame but then the hatred manifest to pure malice
I'm no longer being callous, I'm a let you niggaz have it
Won't be satisfied 'til somebody dies and I'm patient
Waitin on me and the reaper on a first name basis
Now, I'm a let you make it now, stay totally out the way for you
But know that we can take it any place you wanna take it to
Hatin in your blood cuz, guess it's just too late for you
All I could do is pray for you or organize a wake for you
Your choice, clearly I ain't hearin your voice
Keep it up and I'm a send your ass to kill with Aunt Joy
Hey, you can have the bottom partner I'm a bring the sky box
I got, shit locked down, nigga why stop now?
I'm so above you hover over suckers why drop down
I'm so profound, it goes down and

[Chorus]
