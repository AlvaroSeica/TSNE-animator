Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[King Lil G]
Lil g tattood gunz in the building
Baby gunz in the house
King enemy blue devil
Los Angeles
Representing the west coast California
Thats where all the homies in the hood locked up
Representing the set
Real mutherfuckers making money
Wouldn't be l.a. without muthafucking mexicans
One shot

[Verse 1: King Lil G &amp; Baby Gunz]
9mm gun who
King enemy that devil blue
Anybody killa tattoos
They don't really like me forget em bad news
Homeboy you need to practice more
Messed up raps amateur
Half is raw
Raps is soft
Hood muthafuckas with the baddest broad
Pass that liquor
I'ma have my finger on a all black trigger
This is what I give em
Homies don't like em but your girl does feel em
Bout to catch a case cuz the tracks I kill em
Girls they better be pitching me enemies felony
Drinking on the bottle of that Hennessy
I came to mess this up up up up
Tell me why you mad mad?
My ambition is just money &amp; getting these riches
And for description wanna see me?
Come pay the admission
Homie I'm cautious
Doing it often
Holding my enemy hostage
I'm throwing bullshit out the window
Your music is garbage

[Chorus: King Lil G &amp; Baby Gunz]
We bangin on um we bangin on um
We bangin on um we bangin on um
We bangin on um we bangin on um
We bangin on um we bangin on um
We bangin on um we bangin on um
I said we bangin on um bangin on um
No need to tell em where I'm from my tattoos banging on um
Lil g: king enemy
It's all one, one, one
Blue devil: king enemy
It's all one, one, one
Them tattood guns, guns
Them tattood guns, guns
Them tattood guns, guns
Them tattood

[Verse 2]
You fucking with the realest
I ain't got no competition
Be the witness of the venom I'm spittin
I'm hitting em with the criminal attitude of a boss
Nowhere to be found
I'ma get you lost
All it cost: helicopters in the air
But I'm gone
Ain't no one really tryna talk to the cops
Muthafuckas needa stop snitchin'
Used to be your girl
But she one of my bitches
One of my bitches
Listen up homie
Cuz I know what the word was
Wanna copy us
All they do is observe us
What? what you wanna do now?
Los angeles always blue'd down
Thee entertainment that I'm giving
Is getting all of your hoes
And they wanna kick it
Meet me at the liquor store
Get a few blunts &amp; a ounce of the dro
Coronas: a box of the 24
Hennessy &amp; a liter of coke
But this til your speakers are blown
For the memory of 2pac soul
Lil g is the king of the throne
Ak-47 cartel music
Money making always active
Always active music

[Chorus]</pre>
