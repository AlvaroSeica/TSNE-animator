[Chorus]
Let the rhythm take you, let the rhythm take you
Let the rhythm take you allll niiiight long
Let the rhythm take you, let the rhythm take you
Let the rhythm take you allll niiiight long

[AMG]
Once upon a time, I had a mic in my hand
I used to pimp HOES, but now I slay niggaros
up and down the A-V-E-nue
Straight out the concrete jungle, and CPT
Who it be? The AMG, hoes wanna know my name
My claim to fame ain't a big ear-ring or a gold chain
I rock the sweet sweet soul things
+Slims+ of the +Jim+ of a true nigga, yo how you figure?
My index finger's wrapped around the trigger
And suckas around couldn't swing on the playground
Step up, stay up, stay down, way down
D-A, D-I, double L-E 
Back to the old school, with the new fool
TCP in the C-A-L-I
I'm from the Ville, nigga, so you can tell I've
done a little damage in my liz-ifetime
Pin a tail on the funkiest tribe, I roll to ride
Back to the rigamarole, the rope-a-dope or whatever
A brother like G is comin mighty clever

[Chorus]

[KK]
Let the rhythm take you
Ain't nothin but a smooth groove, to get you all in the mood
You wanna come along in this joy ride? Hey, well c'mon..
Cause I don't wanna play no hide and seek with myself
Still lookin through the window, tryna reach myself
Playin my cards right, makin it through the night
Another day to see the light that is shinin
And I want y'all to keep in mind
that K is only out for a good time (bitch!)
I only want a good grind
Hey, you know I gotta get mine
Now don't play the K, don't you try to do me
There's only one thing you can do for me
That's to lay it right and if you play it right
Hey, maybe the rhythm'll take you through the night

[Chorus]

[Gangsta D]
Take a look at the debonair
A brother who swears to never compare
I've been waitin, now it's time to take my share
Gettin funky like a brother's supposed to do
And with a hell of a beat that you could roll to
Homeboys and girls in the house
This young brother's gonna turn it out
Now step up closely, you wanna hold me?
I better kick this rhyme for those that know me
Bustas gettin mad, but I don't really care
They wanna get a piece but they just stop and stare
I push 'em back and make 'em play the bitch role
Yo, you shouldn't'na got bored, yo
By the way, don't think to fade me
There's not a bitch out there that could play me
These are the things that we love to do, so..
Let my rhythm take you, hoe

[Chorus]

[Singing interlude]
Let the rhythm take you, let the rhythm take you
All night long girl, all night long (all night long) 
All night long, let the rhythm (let the rhythm)
Let the rhythm, let it take you for a ride
C'mon

[Chorus]</pre>
