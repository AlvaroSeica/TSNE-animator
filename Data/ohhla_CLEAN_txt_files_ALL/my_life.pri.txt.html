[Hook]
This is a story from my lifes
See I wouldn't want to lie
Getting on by with my lullaby
And all a my friends getting high
Mens holler holler hi all the time
But I can't find no man to love me

Sometimes I get up I'm down
I feel deadened hurt headed I'm down so I sweat it
Through my day this ain't the way chained to the desk
Mess hurt wrists phone fits and post-its
I heard it gonna change but see you in it hard to see
The final minute when
The world is yours all yours
I'll get it I mean it
And in the evenin, I'm alone
Not by the phone but I'm alone yo
Persevere all my fears try to weigh me down
Look around my ceilin's peelin rap deal you feelin I ain't now
Do it myself independent gotta try, no lie
Ain't No Limit kid no Majors
Gonna fuck me up right
I just want to sing a song about my life, my life

[Repeat Hook]

I'm sweet like nickel
Candy debutante on the street what in heat
Caught you haulin at me, mind stallin at me
Need you workin for me, need you talkin to me
Not something fuckin on me, what!
I'm patient like a doctor
Got the stock of proper genius hottest Venus
On top I'll stop your heart drop
Your jaw right to your pe-better heed this
Queen of Mt. Olympus can't resist the goddess honest
The kind you never
Always take home to your mamas
Accomplish what no other can treat you like no other man
Understand this mad mind body you ain't seen in a woman
My mommy posessed this passed this on
Dad made me strong played me mad songs growin up
Told me I be the one well I want the one
Levels deep and heart drum beat
boom beat boom beat
But complex properties of my mind keep em 10 steps behind
Ttakin mad time to find a guy it ain't right
Worthy of my lullaby it ain't right
Try to keep this shit inside it ain't right it ain't right
All night I can drive you wild
The sex the intellect get respect fuck the cheddar
Better bet
I'm the next to get mine find mine it's alright
But sometimes it hurts my mind

[Repeat Hook]

Word to God
I'll be the best girl you ever got, I'll keep it so hot
I'll just never stop
I got the plot locked, I got no guns cocked
And if you with me let me hear you say Nana
I'm sure that this is more than you can handle
This example
Coming from a girl placed high up on the mantle
Hold a candle to it, sick of the predicament
Tired of the bull thick headed
Need a sedative to get at it, well I invented it
My case in point I would anoint you my prince
Love you head toe to fingerprints
All benefits laugh and count all our kids,
make all our bids
Butterfly kiss with our lids
Let's make it come all to this
Gem at the precipice of the palace
Drink from my chalice
Never be jealous, no malice, I'll be your ballast
When winds blow on I'll stand strong
When winds blow on I'll stand strong</pre>
