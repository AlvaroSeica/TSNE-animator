[Rap]
Once again, it's on, yo Zhane blow the horn
Let the D.J. know to keep playing your song
Maybe I'll browse, snatch up the blouse
Rip the foul, ho
And get rub-a-dub style
Cuz your body won't move
If it can't feel the groove
So can't boogie, have to show and prove
Hey, now I'm feeling the vibe
Rolling wit the flava
Feeling alright
Ho, yo, there's a party over here
Yo, oh no, the party's over there
Call up your friends, let 'em know
Fam's tagging along
Hey D.J. keep playing that song

Everybody move your body
Now do it

Repeat 1 until fade</pre>
