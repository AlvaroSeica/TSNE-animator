Hey you! Yeah you! (Yeah!) Hey you! Yeah you! (Yeah!)

Girl your outstanding 
From your hips to your thighs accept it that's how you standing out
HEYYYYYYY YEEEAAAHHHHHHHHH!!!
Girl your outstanding 
So let's not waste no time let's get it girl 'cause tonight is ours
Oh Oh! YEAHHHHHHHHH!!!!

[Verse One: Talib Kweli]
Uh! While you walkin everybody watchin you closely
Hittin them high notes nothin about you low key
Just let it register body is unreal was animated like Jessica Rabbit 
A cartoon wanna stab like a harpoon
These dude is tryin to grind and dance with your body like an oasis
The thirst is so real you can see it all in they faces
Especially when you drop it low, baby you gotta know
Girl you be killin 'em fillin them with all kind of hopes
Dude on the block that be selling dope by the shoes and the watch you can tell he broke
Tell him stop with the lies he tellin folks, you can't see with a telescope
Celebratin holdin glasses up like Sarah Palin knows
Love it in the club when the fellas scope but you hate that your hair gotta smell like smoke
They ask you what it's hitting fo' ? niggas try to fix the prices 
Never dealt with chicks befo', you aint got your liquor license 
Still you down to live your life if dude is down to split and slice your pie
You like to master act all fly 'til he hit it right
Hey you girl with the tight upskirt
In the back of the club where they light up purp
Known to drop it like a stripper with her night off work
They make it rain and you stuff them dollars right in your, purse

[Chorus: Ryan Leslie]
Girl your outstanding 
From your hips to your thighs accept it that's how you standing out
HEYYYYYYY YEEEAAAHHHHHHHHH!!!
Girl your outstanding 
So let's not waste no time let's get it girl 'cause tonight is ours
Oh Oh! YEAHHHHHHHHH!!!!

[Verse Two: Ryan Leslie]
You just lookin for somebody who can fill in the spot
Fill in the blank yeah shorty you been sippin alot
Fillin the drink as the seeks to your head you erase your regrets
Throw another shot back as you race to forget
Yeah the night just started we both parted from ex loves
Sleep wont make you forget him baby but sex does
Swear you aint lookin for no one night stand
But you prepare to risk it all for that one right man
That's me, lets have a toast to your future I know you want to
Leave your ex in the past dont let him haunt you
The last argument was world war 3 
But follow me I introduce you to that Birge Wazi
Talk is cheap, welcome to the R. Les show
You be my Brigitte Bardo Ill be your Serge Gainsbourg 
Give what you came for let me get that car do'
Have you ever made love in the lambo gallardo?
(GO! GO! GO!) Have you ever made love in the lambo gallardo?
(GO! GO! GO! GO! GO!)

[Chorus: Ryan Leslie]
Girl your outstanding 
From your hips to your thighs accept it that's how you standing out
HEYYYYYYY YEEEAAAHHHHHHHHH!!!
Girl your outstanding 
So let's not waste no time let's get it girl 'cause tonight is ours
Oh Oh! YEAHHHHHHHHH!!!!
