Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Yeaaa hahaha uhuh conway
Is this a flamer?
Yea szir
I got Black- with me, Nitty ha!

Listen I'm a ball till I fall
Spit it lik I did it
Ride til I die with my finger on the trigger
I ain't never had nothing
I'm a get it how I'm living
Crackers wanna sit me down cause I'm a stand up nigga

Check! I be on the block with it
Tray pound blocking it
Better shoot all in the nigga face like - swish!
Got ya main bitchh on my dick and she be riding it
She tell me that your fuck game suspect
Tired of it
I don't even let her suck me off
I let her polish it
She be lolly poppin it
Head shot bobbing it
But back to these dirty streets
Where these niggas on some rotton shit
Gorrilaz with banana clips
You ont wanna collide with it
Ummm
If a nigga got beef
Tell em don't go rap bout it
Tell em meet me in the streets
Cause he kno that's where I'm at
Seven days up out the week
24 hours a day
I'm in the track I'm never sleep
I'm a east side rider
Willadel solider
Toldya niggas out my range like rover
Hold up
Grind lik brakes with no roaders
Big boy shit
Wake a nigga up
Fooled yas
My team pro
Mephazine soda
We boss sip
Lean ride rolla
We all get green got yolla
Got pur by the pound haze
Fluffy like ya sofa
That's how we move it
Like ain't nothin to it
Get to work bust it down and run right through it
Some say I spit retarded lik I'm stupid
If it's bout a check
Weeknights then just do it

[Chorus]
I'm a ball till I fall
Spit it like I did it
Ride till I die
Trigger on my figger
I ain't never had nothing
I'm a get it how I'm living
Crackers wanna sit me down
Cause I'm a stand up nigga

Ey yo the name nitty yo
Talk of the city yo
I get busy not afraid to let that semi go
I be in the line lik
It look lik a video
Never been an underdog
Stayed on top with any flow
A million a more my shit poppin out the store
If I hit it one time
But she called me back for more
I'm tryna make a million of a dollar
Grinding off the steps
Could'ntdo it had to holla
Tripein with an atittude
Nothin like my father
Still on my jay-o
Never man I can't let a day go
My ass get to work than he drop it lik a Kayo
Ask them lil niggas
They say I'm hotter than waiko
Texas, mex- elastic when I stretch shit
Richie on his way home and he can't wait to wet shit
Back to back vans
Different bitches on some next shit
Black on black vans
With some laces lose fresh shit

[Chorus]
Ball till I fall
Spit it like I did it
Ride til I die
With my finger on the trigger
I ain't never had nothin
I'm a get it how I'm living
Crackers wanna sit me down cause I'm a stand up nigga

Who got the game on smash
Who got the game on lock
You ain't got the game on nothing\
You just run that game alot
I keep that hand in poc
I keep that gun on hip
Betta keep yo distance nigga
When I lift betta pray I miss
I'm bout that dollar dollar
That louie, gucci, and proda
That's part of my attire
I spit that rap with fire
I set that stove on fire
I drop that -bake in water
I got some nicest prices
Come on now place your order
You know I'm bout my change
You know I hold them thangs
I throw that work around lik change
Come back like boomerangs
Roll with orangatangs
They flippin bust that heat
I know the feds is watching
Homey I'm in the streets
Bust guns and held the smoke
Bust guns if I go broke
Sometimes I bust my guns if nothing just to let you know
Grown man with too much pride
I let them bullets fly
And I ain't fighting
Only thing I'm fighting is homicides

[Chorus]
Then Ball till fall
Spit like I did it
Ride till I die with my finger on the trigger
I ain't never had nothing
I'm a get it how I'm liveing
Crackers wanna sit me down cause I'm a stand up nigga!</pre>
