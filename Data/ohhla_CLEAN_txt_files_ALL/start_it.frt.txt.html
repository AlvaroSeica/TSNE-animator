Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Yo
Give me a second, I'll write about my pain for pages
I got a head full of frustrated phrases
So just bear with me as I get this out
You know the type of person that I'm talking about
These people who want to act like they've got your back
They never had your back, they just stab you in it
I never pretended I had it all together inside
I got insecurities and things I'm trying to hide
And I could never seem to get anything right
And I could never seem to stop busting my fight
And I could never seem to get it right with you
And I could never redeem myself when I'm through
But sometimes, you know what, I just don't care
I'm gonna speak my mind and let everybody stare
This is the last time, I'm telling you real loud
If you want to tell me I'm wrong, let's do it right now

[Chorus]
Start it all up, I'm ready to go
All I need is a signal just to let me know
Come on, start it all up, cause all I want
Is an excuse to let loose the tension I got
Start it all up, I'm ready to go
All I need is a signal just to let me know
Come on, start it all up, cause all I want
Is an excuse to let loose the tension I got

Give me a minute, I'll fill a newspaper with columns
Cause people saying that I got an attitude problem
That I'm negative when I rhyme, I complain
Pessimistic all the time, in these lines
All the same, I just talk like this on a record and let it out
I just cock back and let it all come flooding out
I just say the things that I know I feel are real
I peel back the skin 'till the nerves reveal
You want to come with me, come closer to the speaker
You want to run with me, you're gonna have to dig deeper
You want to let it all out, I'll show you how
You want to tell me I'm wrong, we can do it right now

[Chorus]

Mike Shinoda
The most ferocious
Mike Shinoda
With or without an accomplice [x2]
