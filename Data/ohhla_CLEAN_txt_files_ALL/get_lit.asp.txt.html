Song:   Get Lit
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

I get so high, I touch the sky 'til I can't even function
I get so high, I fuck around and wanna leave the function
The only thing that's on my mind is I'm gon' leave with somethin
But it's nothin, and we roll one, with the 'tussin, and we gon' get

[Chorus: repeat 4X]
Get get get get, lit lit lit lit

[Verse One: slowed down]
It's about to go down, drunker than a bitch
Afterparty with my niggaz slumber party with yo' bitch, fin' to hit a lick
Ten fifty-six, fifty-six, let the syrup sit
Let it get the mix, everyday we gettin gettin lit
That purple purple and I get lit, 'Methazine, tell 'em sip this
I'm on that Memphis, that 666 Trip Six shit bitches
A 50 box of them Swishers, ghost slabs on them 6's
In the back seat full of bitches, tryin to hit licks, gon' get lit

[Chorus]

[Verse Two]
Just light the candle on the nightstand, sittin by the lotion
I got her open, got her floatin off this purple potion
Just take a hit, no time to quit because you gotta smoke this
I got to focus when I po' it cause it's kinda potent
(She like them all gold slugs) no diamonds on me
I chunked the deuce, I'm comin down and I be riding spokes an'
I be that pretty motherfucker and you got to know this, this
Now we gotta go get, get, now we got to go get

[Chorus]</pre>
