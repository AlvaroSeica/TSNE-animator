(*talking*)
G'eah (g'eah) g'eah, serious (serious)
Real talk (real talk) real talk, ay (ay)
 
[Hook - 2x]
I know you don't like the way I live
It ain't right, but it's the way I ive
God forgive me, for the thangs I did
It ain't right, but it's the way I live
 
[Big Pokey]
I know you don't like the way I live
Hydro and a fo', that's the way I chill
Get it how you live, that's the way I feel
It ain't always how I get it, it's the way I give
See it ain't a secret, times is hard
I can risk when I'm dead, cause our time is borrowed
I'm living for today, trying to find tomorrow
Tennis shoes laced up, iron revolver
Set in my own way, but I'm trying to change though
Time to use my head, for more than rocking a Kango
White diamonds in the teeth, like it's a rainbow
Taking fast money, knot the size of a mango
My skills pay the bills, I know it's a blessing
When my gut talk I listen, know it's a lesson
Put it all in God's hands, ain't no sense in me stressing
This here this a verbal confession, that's the way I live
 
[Hook - 2x]
 
[Big Mike]
I'm making no apologies, partna it is what it is
Me and my homies been about it, ever sense we were kids
What you expect, from a nigga growing up in the 'jects
Who could tell ya from experience, how hard life gets shit
Empty cabinets, and empty pockets
Had us fading the block, just to make a profit
Jack of all trades, who into something always
From stealing to blowing kill, in pissy hallways
My ghetto anthology, is a written epiphany
Ain't no escaping, whatever side that is meant for me
It's gon' be, what it's gon' be
And I kindly remind you, that this everyday by my O.G.'s
My years of struggle, got me not giving a damn
Get out of line, and I'ma let that hammer slam yeah
Life in the fast lane, got me shifting the gears
Drying up my tears shit, that's just the way that I live
 
[Hook - 2x]
 
[Mr. 3-2]
Gutter street life, is the way I live
Big dreams in my head, ever since a kid
I did some wrong thangs, just to get some bread
Lord forgive me, for evilish thinking in my head
These streets, make good souls turn bad
Trying to get out the ghetto, with my pen and pad
It's sad that some folks, can diss my life
Hustling all night, to keep on my lights
Wrong or right, the streets all I know
Sipping codeine, and lighting up dro
Po-po's on the hunt, wanna take me to jail
For trying to feed the fam, and make some mail
It's hard to go straight, and walk in a straight line
When bills pass due, then you stuck in a bind
I'm trying, but seem like it ain't good enough
It's the way I live, but baby times get rough</pre>
