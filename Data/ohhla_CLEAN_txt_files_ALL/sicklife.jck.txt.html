[Sick Jacken]
When fallen angel mingle with mankind and fuck with a man's mind
The crossbreeders rap, I'm a psychopath landmine
The unstable, unbreakable, strike fatal
The sick stick together like NATO
One-eight-oh degrees, he's now state owned
Lost in the city of angels with no halo
It's Hades on the surface, best to just stay low
I'm like a Hell on Earth while I'm under snake scales
The sick-minded, aligned with, cliques drowned with
Shots round with, brown felons click Brownings
Cops soundin, sirens to get loud and
watch your back cause it could happen to you
From the cradle to the grave with a shoe
The psyche of the street remains in the brain of the L.A. zoo
Crooked cops and the government, set the blueprint
for the gunmen, the black and the ese cool

[Chorus]
It's the life of the trife, cross and get your wig spliced
Meet Christ when you crap dice
Drag my angel dust fights so my mind don't think twice
A journey in a mental street life

[Cynic]
Yeah, uhh
They've been predictin the end of time for thousands of years now
Chaos is all they sponsor, the monster serpent Adolf
Who abomination Saddam, mobster honor 
versus the occupation of fossil Earth
We wanna bring change but can't really change ourselves
In Hell we live, no matter how much wealth
You got hope, that's been forgot
The big plot is takingplace in our face, we all robots
My thoughts I've been given in the streets
My gun that's my religion, it protects and provides me vision
It inspires and preach, keep it all at peace
Meanwhile, they all make room for the beast
There's got to be a better way, a better day ahead
Not a horrible death to men
We have an army of soldiers and generals in
By the great mystery to protect what's left

[Chorus]

[Bacardi]
It's a race against time in these days we livin
Tryin to keep my mind right, tryin to stay out the prison
They got us - diggin our own hole, sacrificin our own soul
When ninety-nine point nine, don't know how it all goes
I'm in that point one percent fightin back for control
Thief planet, fist up, ready to roll
No, I won't fold, bend, and break
I know leaders shift shapes, they really snakes
when the doors is closed
Keep my head on a swivel, always watch for foes
Homies say I'm P-noid cause I'm always ready
for situations that cause me to react deadly
What I spit to these medlies is written in stone
Far from a clone, I'm in a frequency of my own
Where few men have traveled is where I call home
In my whole different zone
where niggaz stay drunk off rum and get blown

[Chorus]</pre>
