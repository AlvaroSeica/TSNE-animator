well, that was fantastic
let's have a big round of applause
ladies and gentlemen, we have a fabulous show ahead for you
our next act is a young man who needs no introduction

[Beans]
hello hello
welcome to the wonderful world of me
mr. ballbeam
earl blaize on the boogie
and it goes like this

I stand alone like a leper
in the splended grandeur of my solitude
a rude mannerism
to include on those held back by inhibitions
if the myth that keeps you warm
fails to feel secure by superstition
everything else steering charted to the unknown
sweet reciept of a conic glass
bubbles like bass, where intricate broadcasts
experiments like lab rats
pack heat like a thermos, intrinsic
act on instinct and ballots extinguished
stink like N'Sync, I exist as contradiction
taking your silence as conformation

silver heat

MC for modern classic, conceptual
from you empty gestures, cosmetic
many weathers apart
when your a pitter it patters like wallpaper
floppy cock, vagrants, a vapor, vanquished
empty parking lot vacant and vanished
just as lightbulbs make love and burn themselves out
obviously you're not stingy with stupidity
conceited, and your album's only one song strong
chew your arm off and and raise your hand
appreciation is just as impractical
as masculinity for drag queens
in the game of role reversal
?? conducting the hell's angels at a choir rehersal
rejoice, rejoice, rejoice
and celebrate every day as new year's
is lookin in the mirror to watch my balls drop

four, three, two, one
