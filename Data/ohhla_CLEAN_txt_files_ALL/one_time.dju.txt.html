[Intro: DJ Unique]
We're Ghetto Streets Thugs
DJ Unique..
 
[Chorus: Cold 187Um]
I don't know why One Time always trippin?
I don't know why One Time always trippin?
I don't know why One Time always trippin?
I bet this time that I'm only slipping
 
[Richard Pryor]
Cops woulda' hurt on your ass, man
You know, they really degrade you
Why you folks don't believe that shit?
Don't believe in cops degrade you
AWWW come on, those biddings, those people resistin' arrest
I've been told this from the last one of the police officers
Fasten your seat belt even in your neighborhood
See, and you be known the man; officer Timson
Hello! - officer Timson, you're on ballin' tonight?
Hi Son, Nice pimped over your hat, ha ha ha
Niggaz don't know him like that
See, white folks get a chicken they blow L
Aiy, I'm the Darryl Ericks, how the deal goes?
Nigga, got to be comin' out
I am reachin' into my pocket for my lience
 
[Hook: Cold 187Um]
One Time always tripping
 
[Richard Pryor]
Cause I don't be no motherfuckerin' accident
Police degrade him, I don't know
You know, it's often you wonder why nigga don't go completely mad
No, you do, you get your shit together
You work all week later, then you'll get dressed
You know what I mean?
You can't make hundred and twenty five dollars
You'll get eighty dollars if you're lucky
Lately, go out and get clean
Be drivin' with his old lady, goin' out to the club
And police below: 
Yo, an hour there was a robbery nigga looks just like you
Alright, put your hands up, take your pants out, spread your cheeks
Now, what niggaz sayin' they havin' fun after that?
Awww, let's just go home, nigga
We'll go home reach your killing shit
We gonna take that shit out on somebody
 
[Chorus: Cold 187Um w/ minor variations]
You don't know why One Time always trippin?
You won't know why One Time always trippin?
I don't know why? - I don't know why? ---&gt; KM.G
You don't know why One Time always trippin?
You won't know why One Time always trippin?
I don't know why? - I don't know why? ---&gt; KM.G
 
[Outro: Cold 187Um] 
Awwww, woww, slippin, slipping
Trippin'
