[Intro: Tony Yayo] (Troy Ave)
Yeah! Yeah! (Let it talk to 'em you heard! HERE WE GO NOW!)

[Chorus: Troy Ave]
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub 
Outside I got a tek, inside I got a snub
I roll correct act wrong and get a slug
I see that you into money well baby do show me love
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub 
Outside I got a tek, inside I got a snub
I roll correct act wrong and get a slug
I see that you into money well baby do show me love
You can find me in the club

[Verse One: Troy Ave]
Jewelry on Rocky, you know how I be
Told you muh'fuckers in the hood, I'm papi
I got all type of fish - Peruvian, Ahi
I got all type of bitches, but I'm choosy and cocky
See me on the couch, see me pourin out
See me on your TV when you're sittin in your house
I'm on, BET, MTV
Man I'm the hottest thing smokin out in NYC!
Self-made and self-paid, niggaz can't stop me
I hand out, your hand's out like, "Save me a piece!"
Man, FUCK YOU~! Spit Cristal in your face
You can hate me now, and tell how success taste
Not bad, don't it? Mad, want it? Nigga please!
I bought the bar, you at the bar, you should leave
GO DJ, play that new Troy Ave shit
Two steepin wit my weapon, BSB that clique

[Chorus: Troy Ave]
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub 
Outside I got a tek, inside I got a snub
I roll correct act wrong and get a slug
I see that you into money well baby do show me love
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub 
Outside I got a tek, inside I got a snub
I roll correct act wrong and get a slug
I see that you into money well baby do show me love
You can find me in the club

[Verse Two: Tony Yayo]
Spent some g's on some Giovanci and bomb weed
My bitch in Brazilian hair that bomb weave
Her pussy be the bomb it's kamikaze
Touch the sky in Dubai I'm on floor ninety three
Condos in Paris, above Versace
When we party in clubs, V.I.P.
We do it B-I-G a hundred bottles on the Arabian sea
Prince Of Bahrain yacht with some hot sheiks
Then it's back to the N.Y. streets
Southside hood party with project freaks
You know some Baisley bitches, plus some 40 bitches
Or some Rochdale bitches, or some Sutphin bitches
Call Strike Club Kings is promotin tonight
La Marena I'm grippin, two white girls kissin
The city never sleep your bitch out here missin
Don't blame it on me homey we out here pimpin

[Chorus: Troy Ave]
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub 
Outside I got a tek, inside I got a snub
I roll correct act wrong and get a slug
I see that you into money well baby do show me love
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub 
Outside I got a tek, inside I got a snub
I roll correct act wrong and get a slug
I see that you into money well baby do show me love
You can find me in the club

[Bridge: Troy Ave]
You can find me in the club
You can find me in the clu-u-u-u-ub!
You can find me in the club

[Chorus: Troy Ave]
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub 
Outside I got a tek inside I got a snub
I roll correct act wrong and get a slug
I see that you into money well baby do show me love
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub 
Outside I got a tek inside I got a snub
I roll correct act wrong and get a slug
I see that you into money well baby do show me love
You can find me in the club</pre>
