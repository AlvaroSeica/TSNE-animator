[Verse 1: Knowdaverbs]
Looking at the world through tortoise shelled Gazelles
Two styles once separate have locked from parallel
'Cause the less without the greater just couldn't suffice
so with cans, tiles, and mics we serve Christ
I can't conceive why those in disbelief
Stand back in awe that should be sighs of relief
I'm thinking like this it all seems correct
Use the gifts he gave to glorify, never neglect that
Review the word it stays in tact should have known that
From the day they rolled the stone back
Entrusted with ableness of the extraordinary
to challenge your physical and make your spirit double daring
While we Brooklyn Rock and rhyme people take it for granted
We move the gospel global universal across the planet
But since the birth of this you seen the bestest and the worstestes
Some claim original but they just pros at being perpetrist
Biters! Counterfeiting God's designs
like there were 1200 Techniques then 2000 by Gemini
He aims to fade the cross and try to scratch the win
Be continuous in your mix then transform you back to sin
But it ain't with it Christ is more than just a figment
Apply God tips live it vivid, like Krylon pigment
Idle minds try to pervert it, kill it, and dement it
The Factors remain to rhyme Christ centered and oriented
Though waves get rough trying to follow the example
The power to tread and trample clear the battle like a sample
Yes! Yes! Y'all it don't stop
Christ reigns supreme he be the best sure shot!

[Chorus: Knowdaverbs]
Take a break from rhyming and record and playin'
The real master piece is in the inners activation
Some have doubt about the true Fifth Element
The same yesterday as today and that settles it!

[Verse 2: Knowdaverbs]
I remember the days I was a Hip Hop tot
Shuffled on box tops dubbed tapes from cousin Scott
Then it seemed different once Christ was implemented
with the Fifth Element in it the skills are fermented
There's no rule breakin' that's the art of emceeing
Masters commissioners professin' his living being
Contact the cross recognized the blood lost
and talents you've received all expense no cost
Emmanuel! The greatest emcee the world has ever known
Every time that he bust thousands came to the show!
Emmanuel! The greatest B-Boy the Earth has ever seen
When it was time for him to break he wiped the slate clean!
Freshly white, brite, glimmerin' like neon
Buffed over what stood before like legal walls to peace on
So like Phanatik says, don't wrap the mystery revealed
Why we sport Adidas? By his stripes we were healed!
Without the rhythm of the word verse ain't complete
While my KJV vibrateth the concrete!

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Knowdaverbs]
Take some time read between the sinewaves
Excell in excellence plus divine is what the rhymes states
Eight tracks, CD's, back around the vin plates
Form, pause the track... see how your mind waits
We confronted people that doubted what we do
I migrate with Factors a herd of a chosen few
The reason I state that is many receive callin'
But some wade in the water while few are down for all in
Total submission submerged in a pursuit
in a trek for holiness 'stead of cars ladies and loot
Down like a bubble jackets for refining test again
Keep the walk tight left then right like a pedestrian
Many times I've read the word, many times I've been astounded
Integrity and diligence make an emcee well rounded
'Cause what is a deejay if he can't scratch?
What is a emcee if he can't rap?
What's a disciple if his walks wack?
El Shaddai renews it all baby just like that!
