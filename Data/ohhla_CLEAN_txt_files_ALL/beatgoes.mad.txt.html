[Kanye West - Rap Verse] 
Uh, here's an impromptu, I want you 
I'm goin to tell you what I want to - do to you 
Your girlfriend, she wants to - beautiful 
Just flew in from Paris - voulez-vous? 
In the city that don't snooze 
Smooze amongst the Who's Whos 
And I use my celeb to get this one home 
Why everything that feel so good gotta be so wrong? 
Gimme room now, I'm like a vampire on the full moon now 
And I don't know about you now 
But I think I wanna try sumthin new now - see what it do now 
And when you sat down 
Uh, 'cause you was losing yo' breath now 
Uh, 'cause you be doing it to def now 
She be doin E to F now, what's left now? 
Mr. West now, can you get any more fresh now? 
I think I just did, just now 
Talkin my shit, that's how 
I'm a professio-nal, I admit that 
Flashing Lights show I live that 
Fame is a drug, wanna hit that 
'cause they know exactly where to get that - did you get that? 

[Kanye West]
Get down, beep beep, gotta get up offa yo' seat 
Get down, beep beep, gotta get up offa yo' seat now 

[Madonna] (Kanye West)

The beat goes, on and on
