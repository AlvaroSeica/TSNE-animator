Okay I'm riding down the street
You can hear me coming
Knocking pictures off the wall
808 Bumpin'
And it go Bang!
And it go Bang!
And it go Bang!
And it go Bang! Bang!
Coming down the block
Trunk still wavin'
And the Speakers bout to pop
Got the amplifiers blazin'
And it go Bang!
And it go Bang!
And it go Bang!
And it go Bang! Bang!

Yeah okay
Top notched nigga, money in my pocket
Shoulder strap chopper, bitch don't make me throw a rocket
I'm a young money nigga, pockets on rubin
Studdard, I don't stutter
But your Bitch is ch-ch-choosing
I heard they was sleepin on me
I'm a wake em while dey snoozin'
Got the top back 808 bangin' while I'm cruisin'
I get money bitch, what you doing?
All my dreams I am pursuing
Thinking winning, never losing
Wearing red, but I'm a bruise em
Money talks Nigga bullshit run a marathon
Pissy yellow bracelet with the bugs bunny carrots on
Louis V wallet with the Louis V carry on
All black mask bitch, I get my Jim Carry on

Okay I'm riding down the street
You can hear me coming
Knocking pictures off the wall
808 Bumpin'
And it go Bang!
And it go Bang!
And it go Bang!
And it go Bang! Bang!
Coming down the block
Trunk still wavin'
And the speakers bout to pop
Got the amplifiers blazin'
And it go Bang!
And it go Bang!
And it go Bang!
And it go Bang! Bang!

I'm just getting money, you can get the fuck
I got 5 bad bitches we gon' pile 'em in a truck
And we fuck em never love 'em
Call me Donald cause I duck em
All these bitches want is money but from me these hoes get nothing
I am something out the ordinary
Call me extraordinary
Money on top of money
I'm stacking, bitch, the more the merry
Bitch I got the hardest bars
Watch is called an Audemar
Whip look like a UFO
I can take your call tomorrow
Martian music me and you ain't nothing like the same type
Take your girl and knock her down and give her back the same night
You is such a lame type
Better get yo change right
Like 8-Ball, MJ pimp tight game right

Okay I'm riding down the street
You can hear me coming
Knocking pictures off the wall
808 Bumpin'
And it go Bang!
And it go Bang!
And it go Bang!
And it go Bang! Bang!
Coming down the block
Trunk still wavin'
And the speakers bout to pop
Got the amplifiers blazin'
And it go Bang!
And it go Bang!
And it go Bang!
And it go Bang! Bang!

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!
Bang! Bang!
I shoot first, then aim
2 or more white cups bitch we the game
If me and Gudda with yo dame
Man, it's a train
Chu-Chu! Tires wider than Bruce Bruce
I keep the tool on me baby I got screws loose
I'm in my old school, new paint, new day
All I got is pussy rappers on my food chain
2 Chainz I got on is 2 pinky rings
2 bitches with me I need 2 dingalings
2 G's printed on my shoes and my jeans
I'm making noise they can hear me bumpin' over seas

Okay I'm Ridin' down the street
You can hear me coming
Knocking pictures off the wall
808 Bumpin'
And it go Bang!
And it go Bang!
And it go Bang!
And it go Bang!
I'm still Coming down the block
Trunk still Wavin'
And the Speakers bout to pop
Got the amplifiers blazing
And it go Bang!

And it go Bang!
And it go Bang!</pre>
