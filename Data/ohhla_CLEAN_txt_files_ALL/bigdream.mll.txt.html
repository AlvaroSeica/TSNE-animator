Typed by: AZ Lyrics

If you ain't got a dream, you ain't got nuttin'
A lot of niggaz changed on me when I got money
Said it come with the game and this what I wanted
So I'm a hustle like the first time, I got fronted for the love of the dream
And the Love of the team
Put Together, a circle, they couldn't come in-between
Went from lint in my pockets, to using money machines
I got my city back poppin' and they don't want me to leave
No, they don't want me to leave
But I gotta go and get it though
Time is money, and I'm on mission though
Poppy gotta eat, niggaz shootin' 'round my momma wait
Cops run in my sister crib, I swear I gotta find a way
Try to take the million dollars and I'm like a dime away
Never asked a nigga for a hand, I always grind away
Watch my little rats, smoke my little weed
Sold a little crack just to fill my little needs
I was 16, gettin' on my little knees
Askin' da lord please, help me get a little cheese
It was hot out, same time it was yard out
In a jungle where niggaz will rip your heart out
Cold summers where niggaz a bright starve out
Wanna be a kingpin from watch a nigga ball out
Could you blame us, devil was tryna chain us
We just tried to fix the roof leak when it was rainin'
We just tried to keep the house warm when winter came in
But they rub the detainers, lockers and cells of strangers, the razors
The animal go in cages, that's what the slave masters told the workers when they slaved us

Small city, big dreams
I've been waiting on this day since I was 16
Since I was 16
I've been waiting on this day since I was 16

Small city, big dreams
I've been waiting on this day since I was 16
Since I was 16
I've been waiting on this day since I was 16

Rock man told us sun don't shine
You know if his daddy hustled then his son gone grind
His father was locked up, now the son doin' time
When certain niggaz get to starvin' know that gun shine
Two felonies on his record, he got one more time
Get that, push that, he don't want no job, lost hope
Some niggaz don't even want no God
They just want a little money just to come through fly
Cause nobody ever listens to the broke nigga
Cause when you broke, be considered as a joke nigga
If you a joke, you consider as a hoe nigga
And no nigga wanna live like livin' poe nigga
Small city, big dreams
I've been waiting on this day since I was 16
Sellin white girl, I'm talkin' Christine
Young boy with dreams touching that big screen

Small city, big dreams
I've been waiting on this day since I was 16
Since I was 16
I've been waiting on this day since I was 16

Small city, big dreams
I've been waiting on this day since I was 16
Since I was 16
I've been waiting on this day since I was 16</pre>
