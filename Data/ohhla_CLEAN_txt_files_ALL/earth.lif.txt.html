Earthcrusher

At last, the day of the blast
Disaster, welcome to the hereafter
Government powers in conflict
In a world gone sick
And they're heavily equipped
With arms to melt down cities and farms
The final stage witness the force of pure rage
While we were all at work
Trying to earn a wage
The targets are on lock
They're ready to engage
Finally to put to use all of those years of bomb testing
And biological questing
For better ways to destroy and torment
Now let's feel what we've chosen to invent
Blast off! Everybody stand clear
Missiles are in the air to sever and sear
Thugs, executives and cops with tazers
Trees are dust, skyscrapers are vapors
I'mpact! Now nothing is intact
Take cover, we're under attack
Delivering oblivion, one already hit
But look out, here comes another
Earthcrusher!

".
This is what we always feared could happen
But never dreamed it would
Nuclear holocaust
Already hit China, Korea
Next destination: Japan"

Napalm scorched your backs
And you ask where your tax dollars went to
So now they have sent you
A demonstration, devastation
Four billion degrees of presentation
Courtesy of some major corporations
You might have had stock in
But money can't stop the toxin
They crippled your frame while you were walking
Now your mouths frothing
Inhale, poison has replaced oxygen
Your heart contracts, aorta snaps
Lungs collapse
Fluid exiled of urinary tracts
In this atmosphere to which nobody adapts
No more petty crimes, nickel sacks
Rap shows or raves
Sunshine and bullshit holidays
Just radiation and tidal waves
Death to the modern day slaves
Running down the street with our arms raised
Atheists now give praise
The sounds of nuclear bombs
Whistle right past my ear
Headed towards Zaire
Many have died, but you better believe
That more are bound to suffer
Earthcrusher!

". 52 seconds since the last attack
Nearly a quarter of the earth's population wiped out
Added to the list of countries hit: Africa, West. uh, yo
I really don't know what's going to happen"

We support this through silence and complacency
While our government ruled the world under masonry
Made every nation regret their adjacency
Brutal hostility, now we're facing the
Worst burst of energy ever unleashed
I could have sworn I heard them say that they wanted peace
A quarter of the population is fully deceased
It's gotta cease, blood rush, my anger increase
Force, with no remorse
They need diffusion, knock em off course
About to unleash my own brand of holocaust
Gimme an ear mic, I'll start the air strike
Aimed at those who chose to
Sacrifice our lives cuz they're uncivilized
Surprise! Headed for the center of your eyes
Forty thousand megatons from my lungs
*whew*
My attack is stunning
Where the fuck are you running?
Incoming! World wide assault
I take out the US Government and then Russia
Earthcrusher!

"This just in, uh. New Zealand hit. Australia
I don't know what's going on. *screaming*
. Is this the US? Yeah, I know we got
Missiles on the pa-"
*BOOM!*

*rumbling* Oh my god</pre>
