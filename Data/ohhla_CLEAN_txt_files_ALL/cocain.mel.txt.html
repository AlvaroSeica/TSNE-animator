[Hodgy Beats]
Mr. Anti-Love, anti-social
Anti-visual, anti-vocal
I'm bottled in a bottle like a ship built in it
I dream nightmares through the window and my window is tinted
Memories I can't diminish, preach to me like a minister
Who is her? Single mom raisin a menace
A dog wants to ball, green like tennis
Tossin while I'm sleep cuase my minds out the hemis-phere
Weird how we end up here
Christmas without a father for my 19th year
My sister's dad wouldn't bother to pick up he phone and call her
He wasn't there for her, so I had to play the father
That's why I'm close, close to edge
With a fo'-five Desert Eagle held to my head
Bread to the knife and my butter's a spread
My songs locked away, threw the key to the shed
My life is goin downhill, I'm better off dead
Wolf to the fur and the fur must shed
You know Bo Peep got us white old sheep
She like a pimp with a cane and some gold teeth
Stake out with my niggaz and wait 'til they go to sleep
Hard to keep my eyes wide countin mo' sheep
Egg head nigga and the key is to hatch
Lookin far down the road, it seemed so far-fetched

[Chorus]
The world is unanimous, time manages
Slip like bananas, split quick, can't handle it?
It's a difficult world, when you're on your own
But be on your shit, muh'fucker you grown

[Hodgy Beats]
I'm hungry ass known, I'm lonely all alone
You can't reach me, because I don't own a phone
I wish I had a clone and that clone had a pops
there with him watchin sports, there with him when he shop
Doin dirt in the streets and his pops find out
He done dug himself a hole which you can't climb out
But the hole this dad puts him in is out of love
So he won't get addicted to the crazy life of drugs
Teach him how to love, he ain't gotta be a thug
It's okay to show affection and give your mom a hug
Why you actin all hard and shit?
Instead of bein who you really truly are and shit
'fore a nigga gon' reach into his car and shit
On some foreign shit, pull your car in a ditch
More niggaz fake, less niggaz are real
Some do the talkin and the rest will kill

[Chorus]</pre>
