Hook:
You know I got my WatchCuff Blinging
You see I got my WatchCuff Blinging
You know I got my WatchCuff Blinging
You need to get your WatchCuff Blinging
You know I got my WatchCuff Blinging
You need to get your WatchCuff Blinging
You see I got my WatchCuff Blinging
You know I got my WatchCuff Blinging

Verse 1

All I'm gonna say is this
When I walk up in the club, paparazzi be snapping pics
They see the WatchCuff on the wrist
I'm A-listed in this
Getting more attention
Then the black cards get
My WatchCuff glow
Something like an lightshow
Something like an award show
Maybe a premiere show
Look I just got my WatchCuff glitted
I could have swore the other day
I seen Jay and Diddy in it

My WatchCuff Blining
Celly phone ringing
I'm a busy man mami, if you really want it then bring it
I got the maybach outside
Do you feel what I'm spitting?
I got the bezel on the sleeve
Don't you see how I'm living?
This is luxury baby
This is luxury baby
I got the who collection
I got a truck of it baby
the stripe one is crazy
You can try it on maybe
Red and the purple one
I been feeling them lately
Would you believe me If I have ones matching my phantom too
Summertime come around I'm rocking the baby blue
Now I wanna see these shorties drop it on the floor
And everybody knows I get it before it pop up in the store
And just in case they don't have the ones that match
I got my man's on the line to fly in a another batch
And it doesn't matter if its Baguettes or the clear stone
My WatchCuff keep blinging even when the lights on.

*Verse 3*
* *
I aint a role model
More of a spokes model
When I buy out the bar
I buy bottle by bottle
Now mami let em know if you wanna spend a night with a rap star
Now mami let me know if you like my campaign so far
movodo on the sleeve
Roli on the sleeve
I got something that shines you hide yours underneath
Now they watching everything that my left had do
If I pop a bottle of Chris the ---- on the news
And I aint gotta roll up the sleeves no more
Everyday I'm getting invited chicks in the collage dorms
Im star studded I don't open no doors
Now that's what happens where you wear clothes
That been in the Forbes
