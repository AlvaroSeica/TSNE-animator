Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I tried to be sugar and spice
But I'm melancholy and can't do anything right
The monsters under my bed keep making noise at night
I just want silence silence bye kids try this

I sat in front of the TV screen
... always screaming at me
They wanna puncture me and then wonder why I bleed
The big city everyone is looking for it
Step on my ladder and bathe in glory
Inject my soul with darkness and take my heart and go mark it in
They passed us like a tear stain
I'm in the dark
Paint on the wall but I don't see a thing
I write circles in the sky
While I'm drowning
While I'm drowning

I tried to be sugar and spice
But I'm melancholy and can't do anything right
The monsters under my bed keep making noise at night
I just want silence, silence bye kids try this

I'll bet you'll think you know bet you're so close
A million miles away
I can hear your thoughts
Predicting motions or your next move
I'm right in front of you
I'm right in front of you
Your mouth is moving but you don't move
I'm right in front of you
I'm right in front of you

Take a swing at me I'll fight
Till the death my light is bright

I tried to be sugar and spice
But I'm melancholy and can't do anything right
The monsters under my bed keep making noise at night
I just want silence, silence bye kids try this

I sat in front of the TV screen
... always screaming at me
They wanna puncture me and then wonder why I bleed
The big city everyone is looking for it
Step on my ladder and bathe in glory
Inject my soul with darkness and take my heart and go mark it in
They passed us like a tear stain
I'm in the dark
Paint on the wall but I don't see a thing
I write circles in the sky
While I'm drowning</pre>
