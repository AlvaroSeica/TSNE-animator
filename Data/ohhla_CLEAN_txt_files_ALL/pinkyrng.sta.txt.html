[Intro: Prodigy] (Statik Selektah Sample)
Yeah! (Statik Selektah!) Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah! Statik! Uh!

[Verse One: Prodigy]
N.Y.C. The borough Queens super lean
Cut the fat, lame niggas get the fuck away from me
I'm a five borough keep it thorough gutter MC
White ball, puerto rock, black all fuck with me
Get your brain right, you verses me, we not the same type
Money over dumb shit, champagne give me a light
Shoot the shit smoke a spliff with your boy
I don't play that, game you be playin with them boys
I'm a grown ass man hit the mag at your liver
You smoke a couple bags for the fact that you got hit up
Ride around bumpin Kendrick Lamar the homie
Lookin for a great time never mind y'all police ass niggas 

[Chorus: Prodigy]
I keep my circle tight, like a pinky ring
Niggas want my life 'cause I get major bank
The three five get 'em, sic 'em fido bark bark
No sunshine I put 'em where it's dark
I keep my circle tight, like a pinky ring
Niggas want my life 'cause I get major bank
The three five get 'em, sic 'em fido bark bark
No sunshine I put 'em where it's dark

[Verse Two: Prodigy]
Lights out bitches, my Guiness Stout niggas
Rain on your Budweiser bullshit, my crew get
Hard like rocwilders, you know my style now
Your bitch know she represent my dick
Young alien told me P, get these niggas then
Statik threw the beat on, I keep keepin on
Call me crazy as long as you call me like Fab say
Brooklyn, Queens, The Bronx, Harlem matinee
Early, niggas dozin on Long Isl' niggas
Staten Isl' niggas force us to pull triggers
I ain't even really on it like that, until you try me
Never sleep on a nigga, quite the irony
I bang on you so loud I put you with the crickets
I put you up under the dirt, who is you kiddin?
This is violence in it's purest form, catch a body rap
Baby I will body that, pussy cat
Scream at your friendly neighborhood bandana P mami
I give you +Extended Play+ he short you but not me
I take you to another realm you ain't never been
This that private stock that dope like the heroin

[Chorus: Prodigy]
I keep my circle tight, like a pinky ring
Niggas want my life 'cause I get major bank
The three five get 'em, sic 'em fido bark bark
No sunshine I put 'em where it's dark
I keep my circle tight, like a pinky ring
Niggas want my life 'cause I get major bank
The three five get 'em, sic 'em fido bark bark
No sunshine I put 'em where it's dark</pre>
