Wartime spark broad day, all night

[Chorus]

[Lil Reese]
I'm killin these niggaz, shit that they don't like
Broski got the 30, he ain't tryna fight
Got yo' bitch, I was in it all night (..she gone)
Fredo in the cut, that's a scary sight (Man down!)
You not with the shits, you can die tonight
I only want the top, I ain't tryna pipe
Them young'ns with the shits, they be totin pipe (Bang!)
Floatin off a flat, I might take flight (errYUOM!)
3Hunna bitch we hot, we done took flight
Takin shit down, we ain't like the price (We need that)
Thirsty-ass bitches, shit that we don't like
