Yo yo yo yo yo
Man fuck that, man..

[Verse 1]
Check it
Ay yo I got a little something just to get off my chest
About this hoe I used to know and always tried to impress
Her name was Elizabeth, better known as Liz
You know, back when we was rough she was a grown ass kid
Tried to get her attention it was striving and rough
Going out with them niggas that was driving and stuff
She played "Ms. Innocent" and she played that nice
Only in the fifth grade cuz she stayed back twice
I was in the seventh grade always lacking respect
Walking through them hallways getting smacked in the neck
??And like a coward to them girl not a brotha to step??
She had a prostitute gap but I loved her to death
I tried to talk to her but, *cough* I thought she would choke
I got jumped on my street when I wrote her a note
I got knots, bruises, scraped and scratched
Now I'm alone in my room and I'm just thinking back
But see, nights get colder and days get hotter
Seeing Liz walk the streets like the crack man got her
But I had to write a rhyme now, never the less
About that hoe I used to know and always tried to impress
But uh..

[Chorus]
To reminisce is such natural bliss, it is (Heeeey)
To reminisce is such natural bliss,(Yeaaah) (x6)
To reminisce is such...

[Verse 2]
I used to fuck with this chick, she wasn't like your typical bitch
She used to get me lift, buy me shit, and suck my dick
All the time, It eased all the pain in my mind
Always knew where she was at and never second-guessed mine
Now women like this is really hard to find
I used to beat her behind, that was the bottom fuckin' line
Ill thoughts on the record grill, cuz some day
Something in my heart told me "Chill Lark"
I kept beating her, look how I was treating her
Knowing I was needing her, all her girlfriends said I'm bleeding her
So I had to reflect and show her respect
And then she told her friends that she had me in check
I almost broke the hoe neck
That's what the fuck the hoe get
Yo I'm crazy sometimes..

[Chorus]
To reminisce is such natural bliss, it is (Heeeey)
To reminisce is such natural bliss (Yeaaah) (x6)
To reminisce is such...

[Verse 3]
I take my gin straight, save the juice for Snoop
I smoke a whole pack of Newp's, watching Bruce get loose
Now it's time to do some dirt kung-fu then it's over
Had to get the gut so I stole a Chevy Nova
What do ya know? Five-O's on the case
And when they turned on the sirens I led them on a chase
You know I took ??a bus driver sitting down Eisenhower??
Jumped out the ride and head out for like an hour
Took the tracks to La Place park
And when I got there heads was like "Yo what's up Lark!"
"Yo what's up y'all, long time no see yo
I gotta name real low, I've been running from 'po"
Flav G. saved me, we walked down to his 'dress
And he pulled out the sess, released my stress
Much to his surprise I pulled out a L too
Old stories got started and blunts got blew
Thinking back to them good old times
Yo, he used to break and aint think about knots
I miss the days of way back then
But this is 1995, Scott Lark livin'
Yeaaah....</pre>
