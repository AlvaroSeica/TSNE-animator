[Werd]
Right listen some people go and rap about politics
And at the same time try and make money off of it
Looking at the media like I'm going to follow
So on this track every line I am crossing it

Wake up live another day
Work hard eat sleep no play
Wake up live another day
But your eyes stayed closed anyway [x2]

wake up
I think were stuck in the system
It sounds savage but I reckon you should listen
Cameras got you on the face recognition
Watching you walk in the place that you live in
Is you a villain? have you ever been to prison
Nah so why you on their damn television
Did you pay tax for that was that willing
But over in Irque (oh that) whose that killing
Is that why I'm working
To pay for your war and people that you hurting
If Google earth is open to the public
Just imagine what the government is surfing
They Dont look too far
See where you are with the sat-nav car
The mobile phone from the signal and bars
Hi I'm a number on a I.D. card

Wake up live another day
Work hard eat sleep no play
Wake up live another day
But your eyes stayed closed anyway [x2]

A free world is not much to ask for
So how come I got a chip in ma passport
How come they can let bombs fall
When kids get locked up just for spraying on walls
Like damn are we really the problem
Do kids kill kids these days out of boredom
With some help you know we could have solved them
But you dont want these kids like just abort them
And thats legal Jesus so evil
Stop being bigger than Christ your not Beetles
Some are born with the mum on the needle
How can you relate or dictate what we do

Wake up live another day
Work hard eat sleep no play
Wake up live another day
But your eyes stayed closed anyway [x2]

Wait a sec who I'm I to complain
Why is no one talking thats copping the fame
Its plain that the pain was the same with them
But I guess they forget when they gave him a chain
Gave him a plane 
So he dont ask why as he flys over home
Its dark and grey is Scotland insane
The weathers so bad you can swim when it rains
Thats a metaphor weather is emotion
Its all in the drain as the wains get soaking
Get a drink get a knife get smoking
Media feeding ya sets it in motion
All lies so put me on the station
To say the same shit that we say from the pavement
Its just me I make observations
I know for a fact that a track wont change things

Wake up live another day
Work hard eat sleep no play
Wake up live another day
But your eyes stayed closed anyway [x2]

UK wake up
Scotland wake up
Edinburgh Alude Reekie wake up</pre>
