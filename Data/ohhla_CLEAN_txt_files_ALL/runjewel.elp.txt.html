[El-P]
Oh dear, what the fuck have we here? 
These motherfuckers all thorn no rose
Egads, what a bad dream, better not sleep 
Take a NoDoz, do some blow!
Oh shit, what the hell have we done? 
It's alive and it's hungry as fuck
Better hide all the snacks and the dough 
It is out of my control, you are shit out of luck
I don't wanna be unfair but the pair 
we got beat that weak shit you got (true god)
Blew up the spot with that new bop 
(Crews drop) Do up ya squad without nuance
I don't wanna sound unkind but the sounds 
I make are the sounds of the hounds that are howlin
Under your bed I'm here growling
Same time under the blanket you're cowering

[Killer Mike]
Cowering like cowards cowering 
on concrete showers in Rikers Island
Victims, we the wolves that's whylin 
We often smilin at sights of violence
Actin brave and courageous 
ain't advantageous for health and safety
So when we say run the jewels 
Just run 'em baby, please don't delay me
And that goes for a guy or lady 
The fam, goddamn we fuckin crazy
I'll pull this pistol, put it on your poodle or your fuckin baby!
She clutched the pearls said, "What in the world?!" and "I won't give up shit!"
I put the pistol on that poodle and I SHOT that bitch!

[Chorus]
Run the Jewels...
Run the Jewels...

[El-P]
And the crowd chants "Get that paper!" (Run)
And the mob says "Kill that witch!" (Run)
This city get mad to the max
Better wave bye-de bye to the high scrapes kids
Get a tin foil hat for the rain, in (Run)
hot water from the roof to the basement
I'ma smoke 'til the planet erases
Build a white flag out of Zig-Zags, wave it

[Killer Mike]
Often I'm smoking coffin
Sip lean on a bean like Boston
My young bitch here fine like Pam Grier
when she made that movie Coffy
But when my wife's in town
Ay Jackie Brown, just stay up off me
Cause if they don't, somebody get shot
and they gon' buy a coffin

[El-P]
With the pull of a pin, a grenade
get a crowd to they feet and a soul to its options
I'm a fool for the win I been made
to be loud while these other cats drown in softness
In a urn or the dirt get tossed in
With a grin or a smirk get accosted
I'm a sin on the verse like a kid
in a hearse or a nun in a cum shot, stop it

[Killer Mike]
Big beast in a cage with a heart full of rage
It seem I can't behave
You could try 'til you die, oh well you failed
It seems the world can't be saved
These streets is full with the wolves that
starve for the week so they after the weak
In a land full of lambs I am
and I'll be damned if I don't show my teeth

[Chorus]</pre>
