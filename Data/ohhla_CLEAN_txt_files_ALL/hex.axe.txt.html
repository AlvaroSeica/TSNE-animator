[Intro]
Yeah, uh
Random Axe
Yeah
Listen

[Guilty Simpson]
When you boys confront it
Consider that as the hunter being the hunted
I Crossbow harsh flow, hit 'em in the heart
I'm the true terror beneath a New Era
It's like y'all acting but forgot ya'll parts
So I'm yellin' cut, to reclaim my art
Flipping with my lyrics under clean dismount
Stealing all the rap, call it five finger discount
Spit out phlegm, spit out gems, spit fire
Militant mind-state, watch for trip wire
I rhyme like peers of mine don't exist
Twist the top on the Henny
And MC's buck it, kick like little Kenny
Any muthafucka disrespecting me, send me
Damn me fully, all black hoodie
The color of ya future, color of the Ruger
Pussy's!

[Sean Price]
Yo
Afro-American gangsta, I shank ya
Sharp a toothbrush in the gut of a wanksta
Cone head hoodie, no K.K.K
Just may-day may-day, let the AK spray
I'm a two-time felon, I'm a work release
Give work to my workers and they work the streets
Back in the white Beemer, never full armor
Roll the window down, let the metal raw contra
No video game shit, give me your chain bitch

[Guilty Simpson]
You like being broke

[Sean Price]
I like selling cocaine shit
Rich porter, Maserati fix shit
Pitch quarters in the lobby with the piff lit
Pull out the piece and pop, papi
The papi wants peace like Mahatma Gandhi
Fuck peace, I'm a beast bitch
I pop pellets in the person, I'm a piece of shit
P, motherfucker

[Black Milk]
Back to back verse for the apes
Stay murdering shit, First 48
This, that ghetto flow, dirt do I
Sirens on, who block, money in the shoe box
Teddy bears on the light poles, who shot
Give em that night flow, ice cold new rock
Hands in the air, uh
Fans cheer up from stairs from standing in the chair
And I don't really care whats happening over there
I just want my money in layers, while landing in the lair
Can't compare, we know that is unfair
How he's known from city to city like he was your mayor
Be clear it will never be fair
Turn the stove down on if there's any beef's here
Time for the next, live is the hex
Kept it dirty like the sets this live from the decks, go!</pre>
