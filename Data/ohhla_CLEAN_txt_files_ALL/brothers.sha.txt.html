[ Lakim ]
Yo, peace Tashiem
[ Tashiem ]
Peace Lakim
[ Lakim ]
Yo, what's the science, my brother?
[ Tashiem ]
Yo, these brothers gotta start puttin their wisdom in action
to show and prove that they are brothers in action
[ Lakim ]
Yo, let's show and prove it to em

[ Tashiem ]
Peace Lord, all applaud, the Almighty's in action
Flauntin the gift by rippin a style that's fashioned
Strong in my spot, lyrics locked like a bolt
Extensions, sentences season the mic like salt
( ? ) flavor, hungry cause I crave a
Beat to feast on, so Lakim gave a
Opportunity for you to see a God-given gift
My knowledge of self, so I have to uplift
The weak and blind, teach the people of my kind
The truth is light and only sunlight shines
Rays and radiation illimunate a nation
I Self Lord Master, here for generations
Because of the lifeforce, a source of power
Knowledge is facts, wisdom's a shower
Of words spoken wisely showin understandin
Too many people are blind, so the god put a hand in
Our project with dope styles that are complex
Lak's next to flex on this type of text
( ? ) cast a hex, I mark the spot x
Lay low and flow as I go I just flex
( ? ) a fraction, my people are askin
For guidance, I'm ridin not slidin, my traction
Is grippin, not slippin, my rhyme style's rippin
And I'm a brother in action

[ Lakim ]
See, I belong to the righteous and I'm in action
Observe me, I'm packin
Deadly poems is what I hit you with
Affecting those who oppose like ( ? )
My mind's the ( ? ), body's the Asia
I got 120 ways to righteously raise ya
I stand in a square of four equivalent, size equalin 90
Add em up, what did you find, bee?
Not a lame brain lad ( ? ) dixie
But a cipher of complete 360
Usin 23 million miles of useful land
To show and prove I'm the original man
Tricknowlodgy's a game the devil plays
He fooled us before, but no, not nowadays
Columbus discovered the poor part of the planet Earth
He didn't care, he preserved the best part for himself
To build and add on, don't try and play dumb
I'm also the brother that'll take life away from
You and whoever should never
Mess around with Islam, you're not that clever
Cause that ain't ( ? ) begin again
From the beginning to the ending
I'm hyper than a halucinogen
So observe me, knowledge the traction
See, I'm a righteous brother who's in action

[ Lakim ]
Tashiem, my brother
This is the knowledge born born cipher, yeah
and far as I can see 
Allah's nation is definitely puttin that wisdom in motion and action
cause we got the magnetic attraction
and we are definitely in effect
My name is Lakim Shabazz Allah
sendin peace to all the gods and earths in the whole entire universe
uknowmsayin?
cause we definitely puttin that wisdom in motion
and we outta here, peace

[ Tashiem ]
