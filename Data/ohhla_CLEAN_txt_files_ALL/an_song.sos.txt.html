"Can't nobody love me like you do"

[Verse 1]
I remember when they used to make love songs, acoustic with drums on
Now its like cupid has cuffs on and guns on him, plus starving
Behind the barrel is us causing much problems, thus love is uncommon
Club songs corrupt moms shakin butts for bucks, thongs and tight jeans
A new meaning to chasing pipe dreams
But even at nineteen I always tried to do the right thing like Spike Lee
And she was like me
Gettin beatin by creeps while I was gettin cheated by freaks
Proceding to try to be better than those
When I met her she was a full grown delicate rose
With pedals of gold and I'm lettin her know
by saying

"Can't nobody love me like you do"

[Verse 2]
I saw this rose on the sidewalk and I stopped
Shocked like it fell out of the sky
Watched then I thought, "My God!"
A rose with an intoxicating flavour like pot
On the concrete standing more perfect than a tripod
These are my greatest time slots
Should I get a little bit closer? Why not
When I did, time stopped
And in the midst of a "tick" right beside "tock"
Eyes locked, new visions of ribbons and tied knots
Over gifts from the most high like forty spliffs
Help me to appreciate the corny shit
Like the birds and the bees, a pod and two peas
Letters from trees plus love bugs in the breeze
Who fly together similar to lovers when they lie together
Looking alive and living their live like they could die whenever least expected
Each second you see them cherish, being parents
Repeating this sentence cause they believe in 'marriage'
saying

"Can't nobody love me like you do"</pre>
