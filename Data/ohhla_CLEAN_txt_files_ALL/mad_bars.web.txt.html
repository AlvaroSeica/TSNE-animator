Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Yeah. This shit right here is for all the haters (haters). Alright?
Everybody sayin', "Yo dude, you can't spit."
And I'm like, I'm like, "Yo fuck that I can spit!"
Ha. So uh, let me just lay down mad bars
(Mad bars) Yeah

I'll spit a whole bunch of bars
Re-roll up cigars
I am greater than the rest
Super nova, the stars
You're just the common cold
I am sors
I do not spar
Every single blow will hit hard
And I know what you are
And hm, you're not me
Outdo you in anything
Bitch just watch me

I drop shit on any topic
Hotness
Then swap spit with hot chicks
And get my cock licked
I'm a rot pit
Mixed with a little bijon
Hugh Heff in a flesh
Stay rollin' with three blondes
So don't hate this
I can't help that I'm great bitch
I spit a rhyme and I'm oudie (Audi)
Like an A6

I make hits
And I hit the marijuana
Then beat the shit out of Rihanna
Just because I wanna
Haha. Nah, I ain't Chris Brown
I am Chris Web
CT is listenin' to everything this kid says
The only time I get bread's
At a meal
Before my main course
God damn I need a deal

I'm broke out on bail
And I'm livin' with my parents
But I spit
And got these high school girls starin'
Darin' to be different
Apparently it's rhythm
That's keeping me goin'
Every moment
That Webby be spittin'
Spittin' like I got a loogie
Stuck in my throat
But fuck it
I'm dope
The ring leader's runnin' the show

So ring around the rosie
With a pocket full of OC's
Pop 'em all at once
And OD
Oh me!
Oh my!
So high!
I don't even want to land
Contraband in my waistband
Rip it 'cause I can
Half man
Half ninja turtle
Half a fuckin' head case
If I don't make it on the mic
I'll make a sex tape
Me, Kim Kardashian, and Paris
In a three way
Earn a right to disk
And make a million off of ebay

I got true blood
Runnin' in my veins
Sharper than a vampire's fangs
Bang!
Sneeze a lightning bolt
'Cause I'm always spitting thunder
Runnin' shit like Ari
Cause drama like Vince's brother

Smoother than butter
With a pocket full of rubbers
And skills that'll make your girl
S-s-s-s-stutter
Back up in this mother fucker
With avengence
Make 'em pause
Like they got a comma in their sentence
You can tell them this shit
As soon as I hit the entrance
Fuck the shampoo
We rollin' that Herbal Essense

'Cause I'm great like Alexander
Two pokie balls
Hanging
Spit flames like charmander
And I got your chick
Wetter than a blastoise
She said I'm sexy
And she love my raspy ass voice
I'll turn the stage into a slaughter house
Ask Roise
Fucking with Webby is just a bad choice!

I'm a mother fucking goblin man
Get the Cablevision
Rhythm, rippin' on demand
You can see me with the mic on my sonogram
And the doc was like
"Hm, I think we've got a problem ma'am"
Had a rattle in my right hand
Dutchie in the other, kid
Diaper on my ass
Thirty rac up in the fucking crib

Had 'em sayin
"What the fuck is up? "
'Cause all I do is fill up cups
And puff a dutch
Rollin' with a crew of giants
Like Justin Tucks
So if you really wanna step
Better muscle up
'Cause I really got to show 'em
When enough's enough

'Cause now these rappers trying to bite me
Like scruff mcgruff
Gotta get these damn dogs youthinized
I am back
I'll as can be
And super-sized
Like Star Fox
I am truly fly
Can't do what I do
Excuse you..

I be runnin' shit with my manager
Younger than me
When I'm young as fuck
And still nobody fucking with me
I am in A&amp;R's wet dream
Ready for the shit
'Cause the games a fucking rap
When they let Webby in this bitch

Because the game's a fucking rap
When they let Webby in this bitch. [x2]

Yeah, you know
Mad bars
Maaaad bars
Spit straight on any mixtape
I'm I'll
Yeah, what</pre>
