[Intro: Ice-T]
Yo yo, one two, in the place to be 
MC Ice, you know what I'm saying?
Cold lounging here in the new O.G. LP
You know, Original Gangster is in the house
This is going out to all my homeboys on the streets
And all the brothers locked down

[Verse One: Ice-T]
It's been a long while, since I hit you with freestyle
High tech selection from the vaults of the Ice files
Kick back, relax and watch as I melt wax
Don't ever let a brother like me ride a dope track
Cause once I hit it with the vocal tone it's mine
Have motherfuckers rushing to rewind
Cause I'll flow slow and still twist your tongues up
Rock the house from night til the sun is up
Cause it really ain't how much you say, it's what you say
I got no fucking time on the mic to play
I write rhymes with the Addition and Algebra
Mental geometry, don't even come at me
Talking that weak and popping that bullshit
Get out my face, a fool could get his head split
A lot of doubters said: it couldn't be done by me
Them same suckers are now looking from under me
Wondering what I did, I didn't play myself kid
I've respected my fans and made the high bid
Sometimes I write my rhymes at night and fall asleep
Wake up with new techniques
Grab the pen, and place it on some loose leaf
Nothing soft, always the tough meat
The white paper and blue lines excite my mind
Not allowing me to stop the rhyme
Until the whole motherfucking book is complete
Then I write on the back of the sheets
I made a promise to my brothers in street crime
We'd get paid with the use of a sweet rhyme
We put our minds together, made the tracks clever
Now we're checking more bank than ever
Mind over matter

[Chorus]
So you got to have Mind Power, like the brother say..
Mind over matter - Mind Power!!

[Verse Two: Ice-T]
I can drop rhymes in twos and threes and fours
And still have much shit left for encores
Cause once my mind locks in on a dope idea
Motherfucking ducks should stand clear
Cause I'ma hit the topic in point blank
It's jail, you better keep your shank
Cause I got mine and I'm out on a solo creep (Uggga!) 
Your face hits the concrete
You wanna roll with the niggaz that don't play
I think you got false courage, get out my damn way
Cause the car I'm in is rolling full of men
Not kids or boys, E got the Mac 10
Islam has got the Zulu Nation back up
DJ Aladdin is who hooked the fucking track up
Syndicate is making the move with the ski masks
And I'm housing the long cash
So now you realized you underestimated me, The Ice
You thought that I was OK, but now you realize I'm nice
But that's alright, cause I knew I'd make it in the end
Those who like me now, might not would like me then
But I'ma keep impressing, stressing my blessing
And keep motherfuckers guessing
Armor plate my mind with walls and shields
As I escape from the killing fields

[Chorus]
I can understand.. Mind over matter
I know what it means.. Mind power
Mind over matter ----------&gt; Ice-T
Mind over matter --------&gt; Chuck D
Mind over matter ----------&gt; Ice-T
Mind over matter --------&gt; Chuck D
Mind over matter ----------&gt; Ice-T
Mind over matter --------&gt; Chuck D

[Verse Three: Ice-T]
Wise up, move through the tempo of this hype groove
You know this shit is dope, so what you trying to prove?
Vu's max as Evil E, my nigga dogs the wax
My brain is a hand grenade - catch!
I'm a hit you with an over load of bottomless thought
Reversing all the shit you taught
Then throw words at you, syl-la-ble-at-a-time
Your brain recites the rhyme
No matter what you do, the power is over you
When you sleep, you'll be saying these rhymes too
Cause the brain has the power to control all
Think positive, you'll be unable to fall
Brain cells swell, thought process becomes a trance
Make you feel possessed to dance
I'll say I want a million, my mind is so deep
I'll be busting a Cheque for it next week

[Chorus]
Like the brother say.. Mind over matter
I know what it means.. Mind Power!
