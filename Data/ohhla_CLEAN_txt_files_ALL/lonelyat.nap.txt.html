Typed by: Cno Evil

[Chorus: Kenny Wray]
It feels like I'm just all alone
That's why I still pack my chrome
Once you never sleep, that's just me, yeah
Stack my paper, man, it's hard sometimes
To get it and still stay alive
Look me in my face, man, I'm strong, yeah

[Napoleon]
I wake up every morning and I feel blessed
Thank God I'm alive, I could of died at, Hillcrest
I wonder which one of my mens gon' get killed next
I wonder which one of my mens, is the real wreck
To all the drug lords that ain't squeel yet
We got 'dro, we sell enough water to keep a seal wet
I'm trying to come through in a teal Lex'
You know the deal, you heard about the deal, 2 mil, yes
I got the whole world and I'm still stressed
In the projects you get murdered, over who's wheels best
VA's like Amityville, I get the chills, just to think about
Writing my will, I feel depressed
Got to get out of the hood, trying to peel west
I moved down to Miami, where Shaquille O'Neal at
That's why I stay to myself, rocking a steel vest
Trying not to kill these niggas, now that's the real test

[Chorus]

[Napoleon]
Just like Martin Luther, I got a dream
Living it out, my team just bought by the beans
More problems come along with alotta cream
Jealous ass niggas even squad with the cream
Cuz they hate it, you see you need a lot with a cream
SL, only Nextel, they plot to scheme
Just like, crabs in a pot, they watch and scheme
Old man setting you up, it's not the fiends
Move with the glock, with the red dots, for beans
'Fore I get robbed, I'd rather ride, intervene
I could care less if the swat on the scene
Real niggas do real things, like that nigga claim
Work too hard just to get my watch to clean
Then let a clown muthafucka try to stop the king
Sort of like Juice, yeah, when Pac shot Raheem
Say it's smiling faces, I'm not wetting they scene

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
