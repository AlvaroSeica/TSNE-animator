[Intro: Tupac]
Aiy, watch him! watch scared Oh!
Why is it that we gotta be (Watch your back)
Contacting niggaz in the cemeteries; in funeral where homies buried?
Moms all worried and shit
Why is so many black brothers dying?
One day we can all be together smoking weed, getting high
Maybe in our dreams over sheds is reality, where's that family at?
Niggaz say one love, Fuck one Love nigga, One Nation

[Tupac]
Now it's time for; Retaliation, perpetrating get you punished
How could you, cross the nigga that put food inside your stomach?
Watch me, point the pussy out the crowd time to pay for
Past discretions, never learned your lessons in this deadly war
Let's explore the possibilities, them niggaz killing me
Head all busted, over this trick nigga I trusted
Now it's; hard to figure knew this nigga for eternity
And, never in my deepest thoughts figured he could turn on me

[Buckshot]
So many to choose from
Niggz close to me I wonder how I lose them (How I lose one)
Maybe because I put them on the podium before me (Oh yes)
I use to think, that's how it should be
Until them niggaz cross me, it's different now (Different now)
Bitches wait until I got cold (Turn it up)
And told a boldfaced lie (Lie)
But still I never asked why (Turn it up) (Why?)
I keep stepping with my weapon on queue
Cause now I got my eye on you (Got my eyes on you)
Before my crew, remember how you do
Now you want to pursue the B.D. Buck
Just because your jealous as a motherfucker (Jealous as a motherfucker)

[Chorus: Smif-N-Wessun]
Every man has a right to decide his; own destiny
In the end it's, and in this judgment there is, no partiality
So arm in arms (Arm in arms)
We fight to live and struggle (Fight to live and struggle)
Overcome all the troubles
Your fight is my fight (Your fight)
Your fight (Your Life)
Your fight (Your fight) (Your fight is my fight)
Your fight (Your Life)
What you gonna do?

[Tupac]
Now if my memory serves me justly
I showed you love but you the same one that tried to fuck me
And now I got this pistol pointed at your mouth, ready to squeeze
You see, snitching is an epidemic killing disease
Exit! throw your gun away, take your time, free your mind
Forget about the crime, and it will all go away in time
My information strictly based on niggaz faces
Past cases with the law, plus a life of living raw
Brothers at arms

[Chorus: Smif-N-Wessun]
Every man has a right to decide his, own destiny
In the end it's and in this judgment there is, no partiality
So arm in arms (Arm in arms)
We fight to live and struggle (Fight to live and struggle)
And that's the only way to
Overcome all the troubles

[Tupac]
Your fight is my fight (Your fight)
Your fight (Your Life)
Your fight (Your fight is)
Your Fight (Your Life)
Let's get it on now HUH
Your fight is my fight (Your fight)
Your fight (Your Life)
Your fight (Your fight is)
Your Fight (Your Life)
Let's get it on now HUH
Your fight is my fight (Your fight)
Your fight (Your Life)
Your fight (Your fight is)
Your Fight (Your Life)
Let's get it on now HUH
Your fight is my fight (Your fight)
Your fight (Your Life)
Your fight (Your fight is)
Your Fight (Your Life)
(What? Say what?)
Let's get it on now HUh

[Outro: Steele]
My fight is your fight
we could do this all day and all night
So I tell you what; One Nation
We gon' set up this plantation, this foundation
And we gon' take it to the real enemy
The one who ain't a friend of me
The one, the war continues, the struggle continues
All soldier's be friends of me</pre>
