[Intro: Havoc]
Weallgotta iah, uhh y'know what we gotta do son! (Y'knowhutI'msayin)
Y'knowhutI'msayin? Word up!
(Make that millions fam!)
Make that millions fam!
No doubt! It's only there for the takings son (take it all son)
Matter of fact let me get some of that beer son
Niggas drunk all that shit, hey yo!

[Havoc]
41st Side convention, Queens connection
The Bridge be reppin'
Any party that we step in get they henny up
V-S-O-P immediately, extra bent
Vibin' out son it's evident
We stash cream, mansions fulfill my dream
Ice 'reams gleam, spread love throughout the whole team
Dominate the game, let's have a rule, combinations
No conversation, bring on ya good confrontation
You hesitatin, ass bettin, that's bad business
for the game nigga, get out the business
You waste of space, substitute here's the replace
We deface, smack the smile off ya fuckin face
Taint ya taste, send ya home back to vacate
Get your shit together plus your mind straight

[Prodigy]
Yo
My empire strikes with the strength of poisonous snakes
My entire unit loaded up with snake niggas that high stakes 
We pull off at high stakes, great escapes, expand, shift team downstate
Dreams of growing old with my son to live great
Little man I plan to enhance your mindstate
The rebirth a nigga who lived an ill life
The one before me was of an even more trife
My understandin, I'll raise you with precise plannin
and put you on to the whole game of this planet
But I gotta survive in order to follow thru plans to live lot-o
Me and my lil' kicko, any man tryin to stop us he get wet though
He couldn't withstand the snake bite, there is no antitode
Don't you put your hands too close and try to approach
I won't snap at you I'm goin for throats
and when you feel my bite 'you sing high notes
I peeped you from deep and then you got cut close
My formulae-I live life do or die
Stare into the eyes of a deep wiseguy
Prodigy, turnin niggas to protoges
My protege I advise ya ass to make way
Make way...for fully-auto gun spray
You're small prey, I'll easily bait and trap game
This man is half mad scientist-half sane
Creative rhyme labryinth like poisonous cannabis
Here take a toke of this daily rare vocalist
Overpower y'all tiny noise like locust
Like sunlight thru a magnifying glass I'll focus an'
Burn a hole straight thru ya brain and leave ya open (Oh shit!)
and let the venom soak in
You start sweatin and goin thru convulsions from dope shit I writ'
Leavin niggas stuck, I let spit
Trapped up in a web of a nigga that's sick
I'll wrap you up in cocoon, you caught up in the midst
A dangerous as risky business fuckin with this
Contender number one I put you on top of the list
You're the best challenger so far I'll give you this
But peep this (what?) fatal shots to solar plex
Man down, now who dares to go next?
Like General Monkmonk orders to chop necks
I send a message to my whole clique to bomb shit
Atomic, no time for calm shit
We hyperactive and it's time for Vietnam bit
Ya whole alliance gets single handedly bomb-ded
Take heed to the apostle's warning
