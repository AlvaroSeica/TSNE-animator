[Lone Ninja]
Snatch your sister, flick the sharp shiny blade
Jack the Ripper in the dark alleyway      
Devilish Homicide essence is mortified
Cherished your exit, you perish you horrified   
Terrible lullaby, you can't fall asleep
I smash the altarpiece, it's wrath of altered beast    
The savage stalker creep, I frolic, roam the realm
The massive slaughter peaks, the carnage overwhelms        
Your car stalls as you turn the ignition
The fog swarms and it yearns for the living     
Boarded up abandoned buildings who's bored
Enough to count the killings through dawn 
And dusk you doubt the villain   
Witchcraft, I stick the voodoo doll
The mist pass it lingered through the hall     
Yells in the cellar, tales of terror
You suffer for eternity, Hell's forever           

[June Marx]
Emerge from the myst where serpents exist
A turbulent risk ,lurk the eternal abyss
Unfurling the gift, my burden is this
Choose between divinity or murderous scripts
And verses depict, the essence of my inner searches
About to blow, seconds till the missiles surface
Living worthless, slippin thru the system circuits
Misinterpret, visions and the mission purpose
Gin prefer this, swept by the influence
Demons, shredding whats left of my innocence
Threats are iminent, patrons prefer to be
Complacement, in a state of emergency
Chase currency, trapped in the foggy haze
Lost in the thick mist, act in ungodly ways
Im hardly phased,calculated, calm
Forward marching on, navigate the storm
