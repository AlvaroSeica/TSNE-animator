[Intro - Female - talking]
We have to understand that we're talking about our survival and nothing else
Whether or not this beautiful race of people is going to survive on the Earth
That's what we are talking about, nothing else

[Verse 1 - Fes Roc]
Shots bust in (nothing else), cops rush in, on niggaz hustlin
You know the science of money is substance
The evils, my peoples, live illegal
Stack dough that equals
To large amounts, that's hard to count (yeah)
I blow an ounce and watch the plot thicken
We on the block pitchin
While the cops watch with optic vision
Listen, my hood is chaos, it never sleeps
Crime's got us knee deep in the streets
Uh, between the sheets
I write verses, while the Devil curses
Watchin young kingpins get put in hearses
The fiends lurkin for the dream merchant
Their last days seems certain (uh huh)
He overdose before they close the curtain

[Chorus - Elzhi] (Female from Intro)
Tryin to tackle the grind
Stress hard on my soul and shackle my mind (we have to understand)
Makin my heart cold and my head hot
Cause's bread not
Comin in and I'm losin my cool
Like the summer wind strollin through (we're talking about our survival)
My goal is to stand on the bottom of my feet again
Even if it means robbin then I got 'em in the street in
Broad day and no this ain't of God's way, so I'm hopin (and nothing else)
If opportunity knocked, then mine locked, doors open

[Verse 2 - Elzhi]
I'm livin fast, but cash is movin slow in motion
I'm goin through ups and downs like I'm roller coastin
Ridin, hidin feelings behind a wide grin
I almost died inside when I couldn't provide ends
Meet, wish I could say life's been sweet
In street drama, the thermometer blends heat
Heat, I'm tryin to find a way, depression is grew high
I search for a blue sky, but I'm seein signs of gray
I got a line I say, if I come with two and combine a trey
Add a fourth, I watch how these words on a pad'll morph into a rhyme
This might get me out the sewer grime
Many get stuck, few'll climb
They pursue a crime because my city's so poor
My nigga Jay got killed robbin his video store
Tryin to provide for his seed
Seed he felt his world cavin in, before the day that he bleed
And indeed, greed will fuck your mind if you give it brain
Or give it head, that's one the same
As long as blood's runnin through my hundred veins
It'll come together whether the weather is sun or rain

[Chorus - Elzhi] (Female from Intro)
Tryin to tackle the grind
Stress hard on my soul and shackle my mind (whether or not)
Makin my heart cold and my head hot
Cause's bread not
Comin in and I'm losin my cool
Like the summer wind strollin through (this beautiful race of people)
My goal is to stand on the bottom of my feet again
Even if it means robbin then I got 'em in the street in
Broad day and no this ain't of God's way, so I'm hopin
If opportunity knocked, then mine locked, doors open (to survive on the Earth)

[Verse 3 - Elzhi]
It's been another murder, where it never shine, shine
Hustlers off in these streets, agin like fine wine
Ever the lost souls at the age of nine, grind
Grew eyes in the back of my head for who behind mine
That backstab, smack dab in your stacked abs 'til it black scab
Feel the pressure like cracked crab
They say the streets is watchin
When clicks meet they leave you six feet inboxed in
The block's been good to the hood, got hella bad
Some young fellas that caught slippin, can tell he sad
Fuck it, that's how it go, you just got to keep your eyes peeled
Heard about some guys killed inside my old junior high's field
They said a crackhead did it for white powder
He fiendin and so he left 'em leanin, I seen 'em
To just a day ago, that's the way it go
Where they ain't payin dough, so get to layin low (low)

[Outro - Elzhi - talking]
Man, make you want to do somethin crazy man
Get on that Tupac, +Juice+ tip
Get to robbin a liquor store or somethin (somethin ...)
