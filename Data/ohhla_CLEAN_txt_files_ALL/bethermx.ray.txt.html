[Kid Kut]
Yea! Son you did it again
Another club banger
Ay! Yo DJs turn it up

[Intro: Black Jays]
B-L-A-C-K Jays
Remix for the homeboy ray
And we movin on the ???
We gotta be the ones let the DJs play
B-L-A-C-K Jays
With the Marvin Gaye, Marvin Gaye
In the club sippin' Grand Marnier
We gotta be the ones let the DJs play

[Chorus: Ray Robinson]
Got ta be the one
Wanna be the one, baby
Wanna be the one
Got ta be the one

[Verse 1: Ray Robinson]
I wanna be the one that hears you cry
I wanna be the one that holds you throught the night
I wanna know what really gets you high
I wanna be the one that gives you your drive
I wanna feel the happiness of mine
I wanna make sure that the life is truly fine
I wanna knowwwww how beauty feel inside
I got ta be the one
Let me be the one, baby

[Kid Kut]
Black Jays and Ray Robinson
We don't play second fiddle, so its got to be the one
We don't speak in riddles, we just get the job done
Make your ??? giggle a little, she here to have fun
A maybe some of my nigas brought in the ???
'Cause they ready for the wall when its time for action
But I squeez nothin' but tities and mics
If shes got a nice rack I'll make her mine for the night
Shortie you could be the one if ya learn to act right
You steady on your squat games, you keep shit tight
I like what I see 'cause I know what I like
And you, look like you like it rough tight
So you gotta be the one

[Chorus X2 w/ ad-libs]

[Verse 2: Black Jays]
You could be the candle, I could be the fire
Theres no other place for us to go but higher
Ooh, sweet cocanut butter skin you got me
Laid out with a bucket of ice with ???
Number one classy type syphisticated
Never was that boughy type so I made it
my point, to annoint your mind state with real talk
Told you there would be no ???, run for cover

[Kardinal Offishal]
Wether two on one, I still got to be the one
Minage in the garage and the gal get done
Fix something bigger, get beat up, ya know
T-Dot, my peoples don't eat up, ya know
I'm a gallis, girlless, umaniss, whatever
Playas get ??? never
Ray Rob, Black Jays get you picture kicker
One of my bad men wait between
The one, ya know wut I mean, the one

[Chorus X2 w/ ad-libs]

[Outro: Kid Kut]
Don't stand around get your Black Jays Up
Don't stand around get your Black Jays Up
Everybody get 'em up, c'mon
Ray Robinson, Black Jays, Kid Kut
Somebody reach out n' give me a soul clap
Clap your hands, its your hand ya clap
Clap your hands, its your hand ya clap
Clap your hands, its your hand ya clap
Clap your hands, its your hand ya clap</pre>
