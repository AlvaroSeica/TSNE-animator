[Chorus: Game] + (Future)
It's been a long damn time since a nigga sold dope
But if you put a brick right in front of me, I remember!
Bakin soda and a triple beam, I remember!
Loaded fully auto magazine, I remember!
(I done fucked so many bitches that I can't remember names)
(But if you put that pussy right up in my face, I remember)
(Drop that pussy down on the flo', I remember)
(The way she comin down on the pole, I remember)

[Game]
Pop the pussy, don't play with it, I don't care if Kanye hit it
I don't care if Jay hit it, I'ma eat it up and I'ma lay with it
We shot a chopper at the gun range, got stupid cars, got dumb change
Red Bottoms, let the tongue hang, got an off-white Porsche, cum stain
I'm whippin work (I remember!)
Roll up that purp' (I remember!)
Pour up that syrup (I don't remember!)
(How Tunechi had that purple Slushy comin out that blender!)
Got a Keisha, got a Rhonda, got a Nisha, got a Tanya
Got a Tishaun at a Honda and I eat her anaconda
Got condoms in that condo, got kush greener than Rondo
Still hit me up for that blow; you already know~!

[Chorus]

[Young Jeezy]
No, swear to God
Yo Game what's happenin nigga?
It's on my nigga, Young! Let's go

Drop-top 'rari shit, I drove it like I stole it
The Lambo in the shop, told my bitch to Range Rove' it
The microwave broke, so a nigga had to stove it
Dropped it off to my auntie, told her hold it
I'm posted right now, posted in this Gucci link
'87 did 30 mil', wonder what Kool G think
Quarters not hassles, I remember
Yeah it's the middle of June and it's snowin like December
If ya get into the 'sacs in your hood, I commend ya
Your nigga talkin reckless on your song, I'll revenge ya
Pull up to the club in a Phantom, I had a vision
Break 'em all down Arm &amp; Hammer, end of vision
What! What! Yeah! What!

[Chorus]

[Future]
I pop that pussy up in that hydraulics (what's that) six-fo'
Throw that brick inside a pot and cook it, whip it good though
Baking soda inside of her bowl (ay what) watch me blow
Promethazine mixed with a Sprite (drink) pour it fo'
Been sippin syrup all night and I get higher than a plane
Yeah I remember your pussy girl but I don't know your name
I got diamonds hangin off, if they can talk it'd be insane
Ever since I gave her that Molly man that girl ain't been the same
Better pop the pussy for a real nigga, that's on the way, I'ma deal with ya
I'm a real boss, got real sauce, don't try me bitch, I will floss
That's real talk, my top off, I'm throwed off
I'm on that green and Clicquot (chronic!)
I hustle, take no days off
FUTURE...

[Chorus]

[Outro: Young Jeezy]
It's like ridin a bicycle nigga, you never forget
It's what I do! It's what I done!
It's what I does nigga, yeah
You what this shit is loc', what's happenin?
Real niggaz stand up, fake niggaz go somewhere and die
Hurry up, yeah</pre>
