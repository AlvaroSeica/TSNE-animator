It's
Sunday night, and it's alright, I
It's just a good day today
I feel good
I'm feeling fine
I love it when I feel this way (So let's go)
I said it's Sunday night, and it's alright, I
It's just a good day today
I feel good
I'm feeling fine, I wish
Everyone could feel this way (Let's go, go, go, go)

[Lil' Rob {Fingazz in background}]
(Verse 1)
I'm sittin' in my four-cornered room en mi canto (Yeah)
I'm kicking it hard, I'm talkin' on the telephone
"Hey, what's up mija, what's the plan for tonight
Is it alright if I pick you up around 5:45"
In the 39 {Let's go}
Of course
I'll slam it down so you don't put your heels up on my running post (Yeah)
Baby doll, you look and talk as sweet as candy (As sweet as candy)
Look at me, can't you see, you make me happy
So happy (So happy)
And that's for real, though (And that's for real, though)
Any man would love to share your pillow (Yeah)
But you can't
Wait to see me, and I can't wait to see you (Yeah)
Check myself in the mirror and I see one lucky dude (Alright)
And when I look at you, you see one lucky woman (Yeah)
The smile on my face should let them know just how I'm doin'
And we're just cruisin' (We're just cruisin')
Ain't no place I'd rather be (Yeah)
Than in my ride, with my lady sittin' next
To me

Chorus: Fingazz
Baby, don't you wanna come kick it with me (Don't you wanna, wanna)
We can let it roll til the wheels fall off (Fall off)
And you won't ever want it to stop
Cut my Chevy so low, that's it's missin' the top
So let's go
Come on, come on, come on, come on (Let's go)
We can go wherever you want, you want, you want (Wherever you want, girl)
Get in, get in, get in, get in (Yeah)
Let me show you what I'm about
Let's go, go, go, go

(Verse 2)
I see my homeboy pullin' up at the liquor store (What's up)
I kicked it to the floor, he got a clean ass 54 (Yeah)
And got his heina sittin' shotgun
Another homie of mine, is sittin' in back
And he ain't got one, and he don't want one (He don't want one)
He's just along for the cruise, he said (Yeah)
"Sometimes, you win, and, sometimes, you lose" (Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose)
I've never been a sucker for love
But when it comes to gettin' down, I'm down for getting 'em up (Yeah)
We hit the Boule like a bully in the bomba (In the bomba)
I mean
We're lookin' mean, I mean, So Fresh And So Clean (So Fresh And So Clean)
We hit the scene, and then we bounce out {Go, go}
Go park my ride, so me and my lady
Can make out {Yeah} (Come to baby)
Hugs and kisses that are oh-so delicious (Yeah)
And exquisite, and non-fictitious, what is it (What is it)
It's Sunday night (Yeah)
And ain't no place I'd rather be
Than in my ride, with my lady sittin' next
To me (Yeah)

Repeat Chorus

Repeat Hook

(Verse 3)
The feel is right, and the moon shinin' bright (Yeah, yeah)
I never seen the moon shine as bright as tonight (Shine as bright as tonight)
A sparkle in my ride
Don't compare to the
Sparkle in my eyes (Hey baby)
It's so fine {It's so fine} (You so fine)
Let's take it back to the pad {Let's go}
For a couple drinks and have us (???) in night caps (Yeah)
Cause really
There ain't no place I'd rather be
Than layin' up
In the cama, with my lady layin' next
To me

Repeat Chorus

[Fingazz]
Come on, come on, come on, come on
We can go wherever you want, you want, you want
Get in, get in, get in, get in
Let me show you what I'm about, girl
Let's go
Come on, come on, come on, come on (Come on)
We can go wherever you want, you want, you want (Come on, girl)
Get in, get in, get in, get in (And)
Let me show you what I'm about, girl
Let's go, go, go, go</pre>
