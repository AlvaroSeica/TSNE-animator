[Mike] Machine Shop! {*echoes*}

[Intro: Sixx John]
Yeah, ladies and gentlemen, free speech
I go by the name of Sixx John
Of course you know Mike Shinoda (yeah)
Uh-oh (uh-oh) West Coast (West Coast) let's go

[Mike Shinoda]
ONE TIME, for my Machine Shop crew
And then it's TWO TIMES, S.O.B. and L.P. too
And then it's THREE TIMES, it's Mike and Sixx on the track
And then FOUR TIMES, when we come in through the back
They're sayin

[Chorus 2X: Mike Shinoda + Sixx John]
Oh no, close the do'
Shut the lights and start the show
Better let everybody know
Get on the mic and let it go

[Mike Shinoda]
Armed and dangerous bitch
Y'all can't really hang with us in this
Everybody's so afarid of us, shit
Makes me wanna hang it up and quit (go!)
Armed and dangerous bitch
Y'all can't really hang with us (go!)

Armed and dangerous bitch
Y'all can't really hang with us in this
Everybody's so afarid of us, shit
Makes me wanna hang it up and quit
Forget about all the things you heard befo'
'Bout time that we're kickin down your do'
Everybody's gonna hit the fuckin flo'
Like, "Please Mike don't hurt me anymo'"
I don't gotta have a secret lie or an alibi
Everybody knows why I'm here
I'd just as soon crack a bottle
as crack you over the head with the bottle of beer
So just listen up there powder puff
Better believe that I'm not playin
You can love it, you can hate
But don't mistake it, everybody's sayin

[Chorus]

{*beat changes to Memphis Bleek's "Is That Your Chick?"*}

[Mike Shinoda]
What you really wanna do is this
Just make believe that I don't exist
But you won't cause every time you go to spit
(Yo check this out) I talk over you just like this
(Ha ha!) It's annoyin, just for you
You can scream all day 'til your face is blue
I'm gettin in your head and you know it too
And that's just me, you don't know my crew (Machine Shop!)
My man Sixx John, understand though
The way that he flows you can call him Rambo
Never miss a shot, never run out of ammo
Comin with heat like a goddamn commando
And add in S.O.B.
Ryu, Tak, Vin Skully
Cheapshot, and now you see
Fuck with me? Nah, Sixx!

{*beat changes to Three 6 Mafia's "Stay High"*}

[Sixx John]
(Oh no) Uh-oh (uh-oh)
Whatever you yell when you see that do' close
I'ma bail through the back (fo' sho')
Straight to the bar so I can act (a fool)
I figured you guys would get a little surprised
Your eyes wide when it's me and Mike Shinod'
I'm just plain old Sixx John from the 'Nam District
This is not supposed
I still talk with awkward speech
I'm like a dog that's off his leash
Step out with a Fort Minor patch on a black tee
Niggaz scared to walk these streets
I ain't trippin homie talk is cheap
A cappella or we can bark on a beat
And if that ain't enough action
I got seventeen pages in this little magazine I keep

We got this place rockin, beat knockin, non-stoppin
If y'all are with it let me hear it now (yeah) yo
We got this place rockin, beat knockin, non-stoppin
If y'all are with it let me hear it now (yeah) yo

{*beat changes back to the original*}

[Mike Shinoda]
ONE TIME, for my Machine Shop crew
And then it's TWO TIMES, S.O.B. and L.P. too
And then it's THREE TIMES, it's Mike and Sixx on the track
And then FOUR TIMES, we do it like that (like that?)
Like that (like that)
