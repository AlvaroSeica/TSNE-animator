Yo what I'm about to do
Is explain how the elements came together
Formed the Disciples and the Sunz of Man

[Shabazz The Disciple]
I was chained, and thrown in the tombs
With 85 people in a long dark room
Christ appeared with a robe and a beard
We had a deep conversation, and then he disappeared
He told me I was chosen to be one of his Disciples
I must find a certain man to complete the cycle
He told me he shall dwell on the house on fire
So they I dwellin, and they I met Messiah
The Killah Priest, The Iron Sheik from the Middle East
My raps cause torment, lay dorment in the beat

Outro: Killah Priest

So let's now open up the scrolls
And let's jot down the names of each apostle
We have the Killah Priest
Shabazz, the Holy Wizard
Reality, the Hell Razah
Ramel, the Prodigal Sunn
Demonic, Kavalier, the wise one Isalimit
Dreddy Kruger, Lochness Monster (Skitsafranic)
Holy Ghost, 60 Second Assassin
The Wu-tang Clan, Gravediggaz
Cousin Bumpsta, Jah
Old Man, don't forget all the Prophet's out there
Goes on to all the Prophets (Biologic)
12 Disciples, The Sunz Of Man (Disciples)
The Sunz Of Man (Disciples) repeated
The cycle of life
Going through each chapter
Goes on
