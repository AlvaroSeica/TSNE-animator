[Intro: Troy Ave]
Uh huh! Just let the pain out
Baby! Oh! When I'm in it she scream my name out
T-R-O-Y-A-V-E One two a one two
BSB shit! Brooklyn! Real life!

[Verse One: Troy Ave]
I got this burnin desire to be better than most
It's probably the main reason I'm on the come up like smokes
See me in magazines, modellin for liquor with smoke
But I keep a magazine, confuse that pretty shit and get smoked
I'm not the one to provoke, I don't make sense I just reach
Was given the world by my moms, still I took to the streets 
When heartbeats get shorten, the main focus is ballin
How many gambles with life? And everytime I was all in
My style was never determined by mics in +The Source+
Been fly since dollar fries with ketchup and hot sauce
I use to cut my wings up, then I fucked my dreams up
No NFL why impale still cuttin wings up
Bird ass niggas there's no relation
I could not consider you real if you ever was hatin, unless your teams playin
You might call LeBron a bum but you ain't really mean it
You just mad 'cause he drive forty on Brooklyn and I seen it
And felt the same way
Once I got up out my feelings still had to sling 'ye them sweets ain't cheap
Win or lose still struggle, Mickey Mantle don't love you
So I fish taled out The Bronx, with fishscale for my hustle
Motherfuckers!!!!!

[Interlude: Troy Ave]
Let the pain out, when I'm in it she screams my name out
T-R-O-Y-A-V-E
BSB Shit! Brooklyn!

[Verse Two: King Sevin]
Aiyyo! This my New York life
Gettin money underneath the city lights
I put food on that table, every motherfuckin night
They say you livin fast, you eventually die slow
It don't matter when you get it in bulk like CostCo
Ain't takin no losses, I creep on them blocks slow
Any type of sudden movement, I'm lettin them shots go
At these fake real niggaz, I don't play 'em fair
Cause they been there since before I had facial hair
I ride thru, and all I get is facial stares
Let a nigga try it, he gon' have to get his face repaired
Yeah~! That's how a nigga on it
Ask me what it's lookin like, I'ma tell you I can't call it
No, I ain't livin right so I say my prayers er'ry morning
Thankin God for this fly shit a nigga be affordin
In it for the moment, sucka free and stayin humble
When you out here in this concrete jungle, word up!

[Verse Three: Troy Ave]
Let the pain out, when I'm in it she screams my name out
BSB Records, the future is here
I'm the only nigga not spittin chuck shit in your ear
You could verify all my raps, double check and be clear
Do you really tote all them gats and deal cracks? Hell yeah!
Don't forget 'bout my women, they all fine and on deck
I only drink Cristal, or Imperial Moet
No more week ass Rose, that's why the game's too sweet
We don't wear tight ass clothes, we don't do Down South beats
That ain't New York, I restore our identification
'Cause dick ridin never been a form of transportation
That ain't New York, I restore our identification
'Cause dick ridin never been a form of transportation
Motherfuckers!</pre>
