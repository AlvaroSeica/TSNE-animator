[Chorus]
From the streets of South central, Smooth bringing the heat
Something positive to listen to while bumping in your jeep
When your rolling through your hood you know it's all good
Bringing dope tracks guaranteed to get you out your seat

[Verse 1]
I grew up in the city of South Central Los Angeles
Never was scandalous knew how to handle it
You never saw me throw a gang sign
I was a kid and the man of the house at the same time
Yeah I had a rough life but I made it through
If I can make it through the hood then you can make it through too
On my own that's the way it was
I had drugs at my disposal but never even got buzzed
I never wanted to go that route my life's about
Living right and Christ was my way out
Sometimes I felt just to scream and shout the anger out
Because of the hand I got dealt
Ohhh But now life is ten times better
Got a smile on my face didn't come from making cheddar
Never thought that something good could make it out the slums
And if you didn't know I'll straight tell you where I'm coming from

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I've been thru my share of hard times glad that I was
Held close thru the dark times someone to trust
A place to get out of the rain in the midst of the storm
Someone to ease all my pain in the cold keep me warm
Who else but the man above he had his hand on me
For that I got much love he made a man of me
Things I've only dreamed of gave me a family
Now I'm living happy where I'm from that's unheard of
I'm committed to bringing out the good news
That's why I'm came to leave my mark just like a tattoo
Back in the day we never thought like who knew
I had a destiny child so don't bugaboo
Follow all your dreams reach all your goals
Do what you gotta do don't stop let it flow
Never thought that something good could make it out the slums
And if you didn't know I'll straight tell you where I'm coming from
