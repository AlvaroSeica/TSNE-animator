[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Now is you bout it or just talking if so then you'se a bitch
Got to get up &amp; make it happen if not then you'se a bitch
Complaining &amp; whining dirty you sounding like a bitch
If it look like, talk like it must be a bitch

[Verse 1]
I came with Phil niggas with war wounds, true alivers
I love Destiny but they ain't got nothin' on this survivin'
Fuck Christmas, fuck wishin' 
Listen roaches just missin'
Hatin' school cause they dissin' 
Sleeping in the kitchen
You need at least one parent on drugs to fill half our struggle
This ain't pain it's muscle
Stand up, Mase ain't a hustle
Lil' nigga I was gettin' wet
Young threat
Too much of a cat
For a McDonald headset
Mama havin' breakdowns, Keisha got cancer
Poor, no insurance, I'm thinking crime is the answer
I guess Dancer, Donald &amp; Prancer &amp; the Blizzard
Don't visit the place where life ain't so exquisite
Is it hardly working cause it ain't working hard
We hardly had a car
Now I got a car &amp; a harley
Reflecting on this smoking, (Singing: I shot the Sheriff) bumpin' Bob Marley
Thinking damn life a bitch but I'm glad I ain't one

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Stand up on your own don't live off another nigga
Don't be like D-2 Dirty &amp; straight eat off another nigga
Gonna ahead &amp; do your thing
Without disrespecting the game
You a bitch &amp; you know it
Pull up your skirt &amp; let me show it
Spoiled brat bum
Took balls &amp; bats from
Your type
Matter of fact you a bitch I took your bike
Complaining &amp; whining
I went from the buildings to shining
Fifty city tours
Velour
Minks &amp; blue diamonds
Twenty-two's on wild bodies
Errnight a party
Kickin' it with bitches wit' lil' waists &amp; wide bodies
I know niggas with no future that still went to college
Now they lawyers &amp; doctors
Mixing it in with street knowledge
Used to polish
Adias back when rap was only in Hollis
Stacey Adams &amp; golf clubs your crew I demolish
Out the Impala
Sun roof yellin' ain't nobody hotter
You a bitch I got to explode you
Dirty, I got her

[Chorus]</pre>
