Typed by: AZ Lyrics

yea man
it's ya boy
young khalifa man
wiz khalifa
whatever the fuck you wanna call me
and uh, its '09, star year, yea
so we gone do this like this
taylor gang
heavy hustle and all that
uh um

[Verse 1]
new money, new car, new crib
and you gone need luggage cause this nigga's a trip
need to buyer, frequent flyer
loose chains with it, need some pliers, get a grip
and me I'm on the suppliers sitting wit
got a blunt rolled
keep me a dime wit sitting bitch
im mr.space, sign niggas like elroy
and my bills big face like hellboy
they say I'm guaranteed to blow young steroid
and I get it gone, my new home is the airport
wake up in a new city and stay
party all night, then go to sleep on a plane
yea
and it's mill to ice grillz
saying all you wants a picture
but nigga I'm tryna chill
lot of speculation since a nigga signed a deal
but for all y'all that hold me down for real
I wanna thank ya

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I ain't make your front page or your top ten
im not a hipster plus I heard rocks in
first flight on the way, but 'til it drops then
im peroxiding the cut, getting it popping
a new year, got a couple shows locked in
couple of important folks doing some talking
im with the stars and niggas who go hard
getting chavo
niggas duckin' from rosado
checking battery life now, charging my iphone
I do it big, you just the shit in your time zone
I switch those like clothes
charm like a computer with a virus whos mind froze
whoa
I get alot of whole hate, whole lot of hoes
spend a whole lot of cake on a prod of clothes
when you mention my name, they ain't gotta know
this for thinking they ought of know
I wanna thank ya

[Chorus]</pre>
