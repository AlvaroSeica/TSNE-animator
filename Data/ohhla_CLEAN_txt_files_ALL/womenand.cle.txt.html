[Chorus 4X: Sample from "Alabama Song (Whiskey Bar)" by The Doors]
Show me the way to the next Whiskey Bar

[Verse 1]
I'm the young kid with a 40 ounce in his hand
Feeling like I'm the man as I enter the jam
Some of my boys are inside, I'm already tipsy
Heard there's a couple honeys interested in getting with me
Can feel them stare, while my friends show love
Assessing the respect that I'm capable of
Curious to meet the mystery they've heard all about
Waiting for an opportunity to introduce themself
"Nice to meet you, you're Cale right!"
"I used to go to school with you, you should party here tonight!"
Yeah, this girl's cute, do I trust my thinkin'
She keeps encouraging me to continue drinkin'
There's more beer at her dad's place, I'm welcome to go
He's gone away on business and left her in control
She wants to go for a walk, with me to the park
Continue to talk and try to create sparks
Is it worth it, would you give this a pass
Fight your drunken urge, or go get a piece of aaaah
It's three thirty a.m., the house party is over
Should I roll with this stranger or wait 'till I'm sober

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
My head feels groggy, vision is blurred
Unfamiliar hottie, wants me to go home with her
And my wisdom tells me, ain't no need to give in
Cuz' yo things happen when you mix alcohol with women

[Verse 2]
I'm the young man with a beer bottle in his mouth
Up at the bar, all alone by himself
Watching TV, keeping women intrigued
Cuz' they sit next to me when they order their drinks
Asking me my name, where am I from
Making comments upon whatever I'm sippin' on
"You like tequila, I remember in Mexico!"
"I had such a great time, you should definitely go!"
Yo it's never been my motive, to go pick up
Talk a bunch of trash and flash big bucks
But it can be tempting as a testing ground
When ladies give you their numbers then they buy the next round
Hope they know what their doin', y'all know what I'm sayin'
College girls to cougars in the mood for some playin'
Past two o'clock, got a pint in front of me
Should I leave with a stranger or crash silently

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
My head feels groggy, vision is blurred
Unfamiliar hottie, wants me to go home with her
And my wisdom tells me, ain't no need to give in
Cuz' yo things happen when you mix alcohol with women

[Verse 3]
I'm the MC who just stepped off the stage
After doing a set that left the audience amazed
Walking through the crowd, on my way to the bar
Got girls grabbing at me, acting like I'm a star
"That was incredible, Cale you have to rhyme again!"
"Thanks for the compliment, but I just want a Heineken!"
"My adrenaline's pumpin' I need a second to breathe!"
"Well can me and my girls please get a picture before you leave!"
Trio of strippers, visiting from Chicago
In town for the weekend to experience Toronto
I'll show'em a good time, make sure they have fun
Plus back at their hotel they got a sixty of rum
And they're right up on me, trying to get me to come
Promising me a massage from the hands of each of them
I'm a bring D-Ray this is way too good
Should we bounce with these strippers, yeah I think we should
