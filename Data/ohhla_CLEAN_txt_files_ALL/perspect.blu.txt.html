[Blueprint]
Yeah.. You know... Hah...
Ten girls stabbed on the college campus
Twenty school kids gunned down in Sandy Hook
A black teenager is murdered over skin color
It feel like the chaos is everywhere you look
Thirty Afghans killed at a family wedding
Sixty Iraqi killed tryin to vote
A woman gets gang-raped out in India
Five kids lives get ended by a drone
I don't care if you livin in the high rise
You're no different from a man in a hut
Every single life is sacred in God's eyes
You ain't worth more cause you got more stuff
I don't care what the color of your skin is
I don't care about your fortune and fame
I just want for us to have more perspective
and understanding everybody pain is the same

Perspective.. Bird's-eye view
It's beautiful up here...

[Blueprint]
Understand in an empathy for all others
Appreciation as a have for the have-nots
Recognizing people's worth is decided
by the content of the character and not what they got
I get upset cause it seems so hard for us
When we lie to ourselves, we sound so crazy
We tell ourselves that they don't work as hard as us
They could be like us if they just weren't lazy
..I think it's just an excuse
that allows us to treat them as less human
Cause once we begin to take it as the truth
It justifies all the evil things that we do to 'em
Some people work hard and barely scrape by
Others work hard and end up rich
It doesn't mean you shouldn't celebrate success
But understand the systematic hurdles that exists

Perspective.. Bird's-eye view
Beautiful up here.. Might shed a tear..

[Blueprint]
A man with no shoes stands on the corner
Sad about his circumstance and bein on the street
Then realize that it wasn't that bad
when he was joined by another man that had no feet
A woman makes a post on Facebook
about how she and her brother got beef
Unaware it was read by a friend of hers
whose own brother passed away just last week
Boston gets hit by a dirty bomb
A hundred people injured, three people died
Rare for us but for many that's the norm
The daily threat of an attack is part of their lives
I ain't sayin what we feel ain't real
But understand just what it means to be privileged
That's when you ignore the circumstances of those
less fortunate than you, that you don't have to live in

Perspective.. Bird's-eye view
It's beautiful up here... Might shed a tear...</pre>
