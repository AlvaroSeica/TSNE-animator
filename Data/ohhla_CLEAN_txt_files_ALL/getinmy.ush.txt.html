[Usher]
Uh, this club is crowded, we should go
Telly got rooms but I got mo'
rooms than enough, c'mon baby girl
That's what's up ("That's whassup!")
One-one mo' drink and we ready to cut
You tuggin my front I'm squeezin your butt
If you ain't gon' finish don't start no stuff
(I just wanna touch) Don't start no stuff (yeah)

Know you wanna leave with me (yeah) you wanna be seen with me (uh-huh)
I can't lie cause you fine as hell and I might let you be with me, uh
Yeah, I know you wanna come with me, yeah, come take a ride with me
Can't be shy girl! Least not tonight girl

[Chorus: Usher]
Club-club-club is crowded, we should go
Telly got rooms, but I got mo'
Mo' rooms than enough, c'mon baby girl
That's what's up (that's what's up)
One-one mo' drink and we ready to cut
You tuggin my front I'm squeezin your butt
If you ain't gon' finish don't start no stuff
(I just wanna touch) Don't start no stuff
There's too many women here to waste all my time on you!
Oh! What you gonna do girl?
Just know that I can have any one and you if I choose
And, I choose you! Yeah, I choose you!

[Interlude: Polow Da Don]
I said ay, ay, you, you
Get in my car - get in my car
Get in my car - get in my car
You know you wanna roll

[Usher]
That your girl lookin at me? Be clear where y'all wanna be
Me on you, her on me, if you're feelin free we can do a three
Just playin - club 'bout to close up, girl go and make your mind up
Get you back to my crib with your feet up
Make love 'til I skeet-skeet-skeet-skeet-skeet

[Chorus]

[Bun B]
Well it's big Bun Beada mayne back on my B.I.
Never been a everyday Joe like G.I.
Sittin on a stack of greenbacks 'bout knee high
From the +Underground+ I'm a +King+ like T.I.
son, Bun low pro' like a P.I. (damn)
Run back and tell that like a C.I.
Brick on the regular, swag you see my
With the boy Usher you know that we fly
Fresher than a mall, richer than a bank (bank)
Big body Benz sittin bigger than a tank (tank)
Ball up in the club we gon' buy up all the drank (drank)
And holla at ya gal, give a damn what you think (think)
{Fuck} how you feel, I'ma keep it real
I'ma let your baby girl know what's the deal
Put it on Pimp, lil' mama keep it trill
Drink gettin low, think you need a refill
Know you wit'cha man and you still go down
Might be a fool but he ain't gon' clown (clown)
He know a real G when he see one
He better get like me and try to be one (be one)
You know what it do, let it be done
Get it now 'fore you see it on the rerun
Take you to the spot, get your {ass} hot
And you can run back and tell your girls what we done
Tell you what, I'ma give you one shot
Give you one chance, girl show me what you got
Drop it down low to the flo', let it pop
Twurk that thang, work it, don't stop (don't stop)
Tell your man that his {ass} outta luck (outta luck)
I'm finna put your bad {ass} in the trunk (in the trunk)
Take you back to the crib and cut
That's what's up ("That's whassup")

[Chorus]

[Outro: Polow Da Don]
I said ay, ay, you, you
Get in my car - get in my car
Get in my car - get in my car
You know you wanna roll
Ay, ay, you, you
Get in my car - get in my car
Get in my car - get in my car
You know you wanna roll</pre>
