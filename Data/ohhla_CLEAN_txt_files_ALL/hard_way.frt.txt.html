Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Come with me
Let me walk you through the world that I currently stay in
You can take a look around and tell me if I'm mistaken
You can meet and talk to everybody that I live with
Maybe you can tell me why everybody's so distant
Is it me or maybe, when I look around daily
I don't even know the people I can put my trust in lately
People that I used to hang with now they're acting' so different
I'm still the same person why doesn't anybody listen
Can somebody please just explain to me
What happened to the way that we always said we'd be
Right now I dunno why I push through the pain that I got through
And I'm losin' hope

[Chorus]
Deafening voices
That frequency inside my head that says
I'm going at it the hard way I focus
Get everything inside out of my brain that claims
I'm going at it the hard way

Come with me
Let me walk you through the world that I currently live in
Not a thing is forgotten, not a thing is forgiven
Nobody can hold their own underneath the weight but
Nobody can take the blame for their own mistakes so
What do you do when somebody lets you down
And you wanna say something but you can't 'cause they're not around
Inside you think they know the extent of the pain
But they won't even admit that they were the one to blame
Can somebody please just explain to me
What happened to the way that we always said we'd be
'cause right now I dunno why I push through the pain that I got through
And I'm losin' hope

[Chorus]

Voices (voices) in my head (in my head)

Can somebody please just explain to me
What happened to the way that we always said we'd be
Right now I dunno why I push through the pain that I got through
And I'm losin' hope, give me one reason not to

[Chorus]</pre>
