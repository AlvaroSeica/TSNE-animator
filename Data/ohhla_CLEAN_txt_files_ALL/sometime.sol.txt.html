[Intro: Solomon Childs]
Brrraat, did that, fucka
New York City I'm now forgot, nigga
Them new shots, all that cursing
Come on, let's go

[Solomon Childs]
I'm speaking from the enemy's terms
Music for the dead floating all the way up the stream
Blow bags of that red dragon supreme
This is the dream, the pistol pregnant with sixteen
You go find yourself dead on the side of the road
Like the kid from Moesha that played Hakeem
You boil with the flow like volcanoes
Qualified to spread mangos with the semi auto calico
Gorilla glory, this ain't no Boyz-N-The-Hood tale
I ain't dying at the end of the story
And I ain't never been a good nigga
So why front positive for album sales, I got Bloods
I got a spring from jail with Martha Stewart bails
This the beginning of torture
Like getting shot in your ass with a nail gun
More movies under my belt than Paul Newman, S. Childs
Heavy Metal, a/k/a Guns-N-Roses
Illegal money, boulevard grammar
For ten thou', will have your little girl
Sucking on the tip of the jammer, smile for the camera
Some days you eat the bear, some day the bear eat you
Basically what I'm trynna say, is you kill a nigga 'fore a nigga kill you
Sometimes you Blood and you gotta go against Blood
Crip that gotta go against Crip
God that gotta go against God
Holding the torch up, with a warrior scar
Now I understand the significance of why I gotta make it
Why I gotta take it, why I conquer the path my ancestors broke bricks on
Flows in the industry luke warm
Looking for extensive spends from Viacom
Or I'mma break through troops that's clever as Vietcong
Crispy Timbs on the red carpet
The talk, screaming on your music markets
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, sometimes</pre>
