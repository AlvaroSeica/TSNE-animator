[Random]
Y'all know I done spit this round
Hit a clown when I take them down
I remain on the road less traveled
More bumps, more rocks, and less gravel
More naysayers, doubters, what have you
Crabs in a barrel, grab you, drag you
down to their level when you tryin to ascend
And that you don't know to rely or depend
on on, friends is gone
Mind over matter but it's hard to be strong
All is lost, hope is fadin
Everything you love is out there waitin
on you to succeed and beat the odds
Pain is temporary, pride is forever
Back on the wall but we ridin together
Times is hard but yo we gotta get better
Never! No hand outs to help out
Fightin your self-conscience and self-doubt
Gotta roll with the punches that're dealt out
Either that or you're down for the count
like one, two, nothin else to do
but don this helmet and fat blue suit
Won't stop or quit and won't settle
until I make it on to the next level, what?

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
We keep on pushin
Goin to the top, never gonna stop
And when the going gets tough, I ain't had enough
So I'ma level up cause I gotta make it to the next level (c'mon)

[Storyville]
Damn Ran, ain't that the truth?
Same ding, different thing, different robot suit
Goin through the motions like I don't even care
Rip through the levels then bust through the lair
Beat up the boss, move on to the next
Wily, Sigma, whoever's left~!
No sweat, no problem, bustin's a hobby
Defeat three levels haven't even had coffee
Kill 'em in my sleep for Pete's sakes
Scratch 'em off like a sweepstake like keep the change
It's easy to defeat the game
For a change of pace, peep the secret stage
Hidden off under lock and key
to break up the robotic lobotomy
What a novelty from the awkward monotony
I'll probably top the top without rockin cheats

[Chorus]

[Random]
Yo; I heard - Dr. Wily got the key to the virus
that's got us robots bringin the violence
Inside us somethin must have went wrong
We gon' need serious rewiring
Coughin, sneezin, out of breath
Doctor says "Not much time us left"
But I say "We the ones who go, so let's go"
That's a bug I ain't tryin to catch
Wolf, down, the meds that's left
Angry, sweaty, tired and stressed
Chips is down, weather is cold
But I made a promise never to fold
Rep that city wherever I go
Apart we fail, together we grow
So, you better get all your debts settled
Cause one uf us'll make it into the next level

[Chorus]</pre>
