[Verse One: Ice-T]
I love you, and will always love you
When I'm without you, I feel so alone
When I was young, I didn't know you existed
But introduced to you, still as a child
Mom and dad used to fight about you at night
To obtain you; wasn't easy for certain types
As I grew, too many friends died over you
I didn't have you, so my sex life was none
I needed you, and street life was the answer
I found you with the use of a gun!

[Chorus: Ernie C - Ice-T]
MONEY!! - Can kill men
MONEY!! - Controls sin
MONEY!! - Can move all
MONEY!! - Is true power
MONEY!! - Root of all evil
MONEY!! - The root of all evil
MONEY!! - Root of all evil
MONEY!! - The root of all evil

[Verse Two: Ice-T]
As I grew my love for you became deeper
Addicted to you, I was sprung on your juice
The more of you I possessed, the more power
Anything could be obtained with your use
But the quest for you spelled pain for my victims
Cause for you; I'd end a life without thought
Anything in my way would be chopped down
Cause for me happiness would be bought!

[Chorus: Ernie C - Ice-T]
MONEY!! - Can kill men
MONEY!! - Controls sin
MONEY!! - Can move all
MONEY!! - Is true power
MONEY!! - Root of all evil
MONEY!! - Root of all evil
MONEY!! - Root of all evil
MONEY!! - Root of all evil

[Verse Two: Ice-T]
People lie and say: you really don't matter
Singers front and say they really don't care
If they don't want you, yo, well send you to me
Cause you and I, are in an endless affair

[Chorus: Ernie C - Ice-T]
MONEY!! - Can kill men - Root of all evil
MONEY!! - Controls sin - Root of all evil
MONEY!! - Can move all - Root of all evil
MONEY!! - Is true power - Root of all evil
MONEY!! - Root of all evil
MONEY!! - Root of all evil
MONEY!! - Root of all evil
MONEY!! - Root of all evil

[Outro: Ice-T overlapping the above Chorus]
Yeah! all you motherfuckers, whack motherfuckers out there
Acting like you don't wanna get no money
Wearing torn Jeans, living in mansions, motherfucker you need to suck my
dick!
I'm bad, I'm trying to get paid, I'm no shame to my motherfucking game
You're lying motherfuckers, and you're full of shit
Shit! I'm trying to get some money, at least I ain't lying, word!
Ernie, Fuck these niggaz man, let's go to shopping man
And sing this dope shit over here tomorrow man
When I steal some Rolex and some.. to fuck us up </pre>
