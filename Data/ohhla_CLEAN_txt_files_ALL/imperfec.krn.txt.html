(*talking*)
People always think they, know you
Na-na-na, na-na, na-na-na
Let's get em

[K-Rino]
How can I perfect myself, I just wanna learn the ways
Many chapters in the book of life, you gotta turn the page
Lying and chicanery, no more living dangerously
You ain't with me everyday, so you don't see the change in me
Yeah it's been a long road, evil got a song hold
They say I ain't perfect, tell me something that I don't know
Running trying to make up ground, ain't no time to play around
Every time I plan to rise, others plot to take me down
Yeah man it's a dirty, got them words from Murder One
Anytime I'm bout to judge, I think about the dirt I done
I'ma try to find the top, whether people ride or not
Some say they have no regrets, I can't lie I got a lot
Keep your ignorant opinions, see I don't need none of em
It's only ten or twelve people I trust, and you not one of em
I knew that I'd be criticized, slandered with opposing talk
So why would I complain about a path, that I chose to walk yeah

[Chorus]
Made mistakes, while trying to build
I'm not perfect, but I still
Keep my focus, keep my pride
Don't allow no hate inside
I, took some chances to prevail
Some would work out, some would fail
But, in the end though none agree
When ya'll are gone, I'll still be me

[K-Rino]
It's getting harder to survive, all you wanna do is hide
Wish that you could make it stop, contemplated suicide
If you that stupid try it, there won't be no intervention
Some people need help for real, you just trying to get attention
Put my demons on a page, exercised em vocally
People criticize me daily, who the hell you spose' to be
Judge me all the way through, hateful and ungrateful
Ridiculing me, for trying to drop knowledge and save you
The damn nerve of you, I did that cause I loved you
Always walked among the people, never stood above you
My brain had no peace at times, trying to write some decent lines
Every move I made up in this shit, I had the streets in mind
Never changed scenery, some hate me instinctively
You think I lose sleep, worrying bout what people think of me
Lot of people know the truth, most of em just scared to tell it
Observing my soul, I guess they mad because I didn't sell it yeah

[Chorus]

[K-Rino]
You say that my work is worthless, in vein not worth a damn
Well I guess it's plenty artists, doing better than I am
With way more money way more power, none of them you trying to touch
But if I'm so irrelevant, why the hell I'm on your mind so much
In your eyes, governments and dirty cops do not apply
Dragon growling at you, why the hell you trying to swallow flies
Ya'll don't wanna unify, to you I do nothing dude
I ain't poisoning the food, I ain't shooting up no schools
I ain't selling dope and guns, I ain't stealing from the poor
You must be a undercover agent, who you working for
Go at me I go at you, make sure that you tell em that
Anytime you cease exist, you'll see where the jealous at yeah

[Chorus]</pre>
