[Mr. Serv-On]
Fuck this shit man
I'm tired of being broke
Fuck this, I ain't never had a damn thing ya know what I'm sayin?
It's time I let my nuts hang man
Fuck this, I'm tired of being broke

Coming up I never had a damn thing
I never knew my pops cause they put his little ass in a sling
Just came up peepin hustlers at the local spot
Bangin away, cuttin straight workin fuckin shop
The year was '83
Never knew what it was to be a G
17 years in the hood
But I'm still wishin that I could bring noise like the big boys
But I'm still tagging along with my Tonka toys
Why my cousin's on the corner slangin twenty parts
Tryin to watch his back so he won't come up short
But if he keeps dippin on the side
With a slide he's gonna take a long long ride
But as time passed I peeped game
Rose from a boy to a man, made my snaps, made a change
My cousin came up short
I'm sorry, two shots to the heart
I did, business never personal, I'm with it

[King George]
Job well done Mr. Serv-On.
Here's your envelope man.
[Mr. Serv-On]
Yeah, you know what I'm sayin?
It ain't no thang, I'm all about that drama.
Straight up about makin that money ya know what I'm sayin?
It ain't no problems, me and my boy we handle that ya know?
I can do it by myself but I still need a little backup ya know?
[King George]
Yeah, you got No Limit records straight up behind you.
[Mr. Serv-On]
Yeah, good checkin out.  
It's all good.

Chorus
Handle your business, don't let your business handle you  x8

Steady creepin, old folks peepin
It's cold in the chest, pass the heart smokin cess
Jackers peep the game I got nuts for the same
I wanna kick the crib, start a new life
But mama's home alone, it's been twenty years since she's been my daddy's wife
But my time has come, pack my bags missin only one
I gotta get the job done, but I'm still my mama's son
I pack the bible like the good desciple
Cause I know I'm gonna do some dirt
Some fools come up short with the money so it's time I put in work
I kick the door, he's beggin for forgiveness
I'm peepin for a witness
Two shots rang out
Tears from his eyes to his mouth
I tied a note to his throat, no last words spoke
He died on his blood as he choke
(Sounds of dat nigga chokin) I'm feelin bad, but the pay is good lo

Chorus x8

I'm takin the time to think about the things I did
I wanna ask the Lord for forgiveness if I live
I know my days are numbered in this life
I wanna learn to like the ones I never learned to like
My mama said I need to take confession
To learn the lesson I took confession
But I'm still bringin terror with this bloody session
But the more I make the more my heart can take
I'm tryin to shake this fear but I can't wait
Murder was the case that made my heart race
I need to break a sweat, I hit my gym set
Pumpin Master P until my clothes get wet
Uh, as I make my move to my next set
Shots rang out I'm takin two to the neck
I fall to the floor, grab for my strap and reach for the door
So I can see who had the nuts to send me up
I took my last smile and let my eyes shut

Chorus x8</pre>
