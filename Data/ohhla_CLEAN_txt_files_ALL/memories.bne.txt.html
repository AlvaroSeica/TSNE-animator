[Intro]
Well let me take you to my hood, my hood...
Come on baby, let's rock this shit. Come on

[Bizzy Bone]
Here's a tear for you kiddo, I've cried a river
It's been bittersweet, so complete, I'm still with'cha
Hear me, you know I hear you, I feel you Heavenly Father
Time goes time flows; Real water
Well baby, just shine for me, send a bunch of angels to your rescue
E, the (?), it's him through the seems
Never dismiss you, God is the realest love that I've known
I came back from a walk like "Daddy, you will be known"
You will be owed to the ozone layers
Could you take me to the strip club? My club, baby, cause you a playa
You tell 'em that I love 'em and I need 'em; Let's live together
When Hell tries to break the love, say a prayer, making it better
Inner and outer, this is the way that we talk
this is the way that we walk; Babe' you're all that I got
I say we sing for me, do your thing for me 'cause Eden is good
Now, let me take you to my hood, now come into my hood

[Break]
This dude on the bus and shit, who was fucking with me cause I was young
And y'know what I'm saying? Flesh uh, stood his ass up
Flesh is like crazy, y'know what I'm saying?
Nigga, did about 15 years in prison
He's still doing prison time. Flesh backs his ass down, pulled his seat back!
Baw! on the dude and this is a big motherfucker
dude didn't say a motherfucking thing

[Bizzy Bone]
A stroll down memories, the light will guide you
Honor your mother, honor your father right beside you
Hide you? Never, 9-12 September
You ain't sucking nothing but a bottle of beer I respect ya
Forever, do you know forever? Whenever we leave they might cry
Shit, baby they better
It's cold, I need a sweater, you bold when it's cold?
And the story ain't told, confess your sins; They owed
Anything for the truth, baby, raise the roof
A little doctor, doctor, breaking 'em off proper
Prosper, prosperous watch yourself and everybody else; Settle for nothing but the best
You need some help? Just call, I'll be right there with you
It ain't no fussing or fighting and I won't hit you, huh
You need some help? Just call, I'll be right there with you
It ain't no fussing or no fighting, I won't hit you

[-Break]
Krayzie Bone, I love that dude and he's always been like my favorite rapper
When we were walking the streets, it was just him and I together
We were the only people that would walk and everybody else was in the house
my people said he couldn't stay over there, he didn't want to go to his house
so we walked the streets and we drunk Power-Master the entire night
I don't know if you remember that Colt 45, so it was a beautiful thing

[Bizzy Bone]
Lord, when I'm walking, I'm knowing that your walking right with me
You defend me and you mend me, even when I get tipsy
Kinda crazy in the battlefield, still, you with me
You never tempt me never hurt me
I'll be dirty for you, I'd be purdy for you, I'd go through 40 for you
I praise Jesus, that's the real man, you my boo
Brainwav,e no discussion, percussion and plenty love
Lil' Bone Thugs-N-Harmony help from up above
It's the test of the flesh, confusion testing my rep, so what?
That's me, I did it I got the weps
And I weep and I wept and my lips been cleft
Watch yourself, now watch your step; Now gimme a hug my love
Baby, I love you without a question or a doubt in my mind
Drink wine, just chill, you real, let's dine
Steak, shrimp 'n lobster and chicken
even linguine I can feel you and I know that I need you
and plus I'm needed

[Break]
One time he kidnapped my ass, he took me to New York, he took me to a casino
And I had the opportunity to battle Jay-Z and Damon Dash was there
and I said Krayzie Bone's lyrics. And we was battling for 30 dollars
Dude said ''I ain't never heard no shit like this before, take the money''
And he said ''Who the fuck are you?'' I said ''Man, we Bone Thugs-N-Harmony"

[Outro]
Layzie Bone, Krayzie Bone, Wish Bone, Flesh-N-Bone locked up in jail
I love you, baby. I see you when you get there
And if you ain't find them, I'm telling you nigga
I'm a see you somewhere. Ha ha. One time</pre>
