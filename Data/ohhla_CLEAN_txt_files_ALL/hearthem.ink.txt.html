Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
Yeah, Uh, Weed in the blunt, bitch in my lap
I can hear them talk, we ain't worried bout that, though (No)
No, you ain't gotta front, had the time of your life
You know how that go, do it just how I like

[Verse 1]
You know what it is on sight: Alumni batgang; up all night
Niggas smell like pussies, act like dykes
Better watch yo hand cause I just might bite (Uh)
Beat up the beat
Hook to the left, uppercut to the right
I'm the shit, better get a wet wipe
And cuff yo chick, lock down yo wife, now what?
Shoe box money, I don't need a bank
Got a 9 millimeter, I don't need a safe
Bitch it's Up and Away, I don't need a cape
But I'm ready for the rapture like Anita Baker
Molly got my face turned
Feeling like a bad boy right before Mase turn
Bitch I'm goin' in, cutting lines, I don't wait turns
Smoking on that Kill Bill, make her sign a waiver, then I give that ho the vapors

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I got a bitch in the back, got a ho in the front
Two at the same damn time, both rolling a blunt
Their red eyes looking like that time of the month
Said money talking and these motherfuckers sound like monks
Tell them, they ain't saying much
Up late, but it's looking like lunch
I make in a week, in a month, in a day, what you motherfuckers make in a lifetime
Got your girl in my eyesight, and I'm all in her iPod
Say, she see me on HotNewHipHop "You is a motherfucking icon"</pre>
