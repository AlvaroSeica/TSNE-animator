[Chorus]
You out grown Nikki up
You out grown Nikki up
You out grown Nikki up
Bet she can say she was sex fiend
You out grown Nikki up
Bet she can say she was sex fiend

[Verse]
Strictly models and bottles
Bitches gargle and swallow
Strictly models and bottles
Bitches gargle and swallow
Strictly models and bottles
Bitches gargle and swallow
Hit the throttles get over that pothole
In auto and I know
Haters followin' squagle
When I go mano y mano
Fuck my models, I kill you
My guns I fill autos with hollows
Tuck it in my way
In case you thinking I'm a
Punch 'em in his face
Swinging I'm a squeeze the llama
We pull on us, leave you on a street
You wanna see manana
Primadona season 1 of CSI
I bring the drama
Hard, body and I
Hit a nigga with a couple of bullets like a
John got in disguise,
That's a rapper, click clack your
Somebody gon' die
Physical with your physical deflict won't mess with me
And I'm a gonna get it on Nikki
We Bonnie and Clyde
We Lil Kim and Biggie, we Hannah C and Sticky
Made for eachother, you haters come and get me
You haters coming with me, she gon' give you a hickie
That red bean on your neck, a kiss of death from Nikki

[Chorus]
You out grown Nikki up
Bet she can say she was sex fiend
(I love my baby Nikki)
You out grown Nikki up
Bet she can say she was sex fiend
(Meet my baby Nikki)
You out grown Nikki up
Bet she can say she was sex fiend
(I love my baby Nikki)
You out grown Nikki up
Bet she can say she was sex fiend
(Meet my baby Nikki)

[Verse]
Fuck around I surround you
Couple rounds when that howl
Surveilled crawl the shit out you
Down on the ground where they found you
We devour you cowards now
'Cause our power allow us
We don't bounce with you slouchers
Life's outstanding without you
And I don't even care
What's you busters planning
My pistol's in the air
Call out the upper hand and
Bust my cannon gun gigantic
Suckers running, mothers panic
Brother franning, come God damn it
Hump the granny, fuck this planet

[Verse]
Nikki take the control
She becoming when I play with her click click
Strip you naked for show
Then she blow you, black hole you
Biggest ganster I know
Soon as you choose for me to shoot you
In the future
I introduce you to my baby Nicole
She likes ménage à trois, mardi gras, hardy das
All day she dreamin' 'bout sex
She even body broads
You think you can handle us
Say under your breath
'Cause you gon' fall for her
When she love you to death

[Chorus]
You out grown Nikki up
Bet she can say she was sex fiend
(I love my baby Nikki)
You out grown Nikki up
Bet she can say she was sex fiend
(Meet my baby Nikki)
You out grown Nikki up
Bet she can say she was sex fiend
(I love my baby Nikki)
You out grown Nikki up
Bet she can say she was sex fiend
(Meet my baby Nikki)

[Interlude]
Two love birds riding in the streets
K I L L I N G
Two love birds riding in the streets
K I L L I N G
Two love birds riding in the streets
K I L L I N G
Two love birds riding in the streets
K I L L I N G

[Chorus]
You out grown Nikki up
Bet she can say she was sex fiend
(I love my baby Nikki)
You out grown Nikki up
Bet she can say she was sex fiend
(Meet my baby Nikki)
You out grown Nikki up
Bet she can say she was sex fiend
(I love my baby Nikki)
You out grown Nikki up
Bet she can say she was sex fiend
(Meet my baby Nikki)

[Outro]
You out grown Nikki up
Bet she can say she was sex fiend
You out grown Nikki up
Bet she can say she was sex fiend</pre>
