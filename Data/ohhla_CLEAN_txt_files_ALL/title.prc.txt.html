[Sean Price]
Yeah, P!!
I'm the best in the borough, I'm the best in the city
I'm the best of the state, and the rest of you fakes
Don't question the Ape, throw the sket at your face
Bang bang shoot 'em up, make a mess of the place
Oh you a E head, oh you a weed head
I got a big gun, bigger than Maxi Priest dreads
Fuck a rhyme though I'm, back on my grind mode
Me and my connect we keepin it kosher like +Shyne Po+
How that nine go? (BLAOW!) Where your guns at?
Fakin moves, 80's fool, he a lunch pack
This a dumb rap, but I can rap smarter
The educated rapper, the African Godfather
Just shoot and spray, Ruck bumaye
Mandingo warrior, from the Alajufray
Y'all niggaz know the flow is weak and your bitch suck dick for show tickets
P!!

Yo; you a battle rapper, you be rappin in battles
I shoot your shit up, Duke it's a wrap for the battle
Niggaz yap and they tattle, it's a wrap when I catch you
Chrome to your eyefold, you got clapped at your apple
I'm God's favorite, I'm flagrant, the arms facin
I'm breakin your arms while niggaz rapin your moms naked
P forever, I'm better, the wordsmith
Lyrically Michael the Tyson, you Trevor the Berbick
... Smack a nigga on sight B
... Adidas track suit with Nikes
Mean muggin who? Your jeans colorful
Rainbow Brite, good night, I can't fuck with you
You a lame homey, do ya thing homey
Put your head between your legs and do your thing homey
Literally - y'all niggaz is bitch boys
The last LP, I quit boy - P!!</pre>
