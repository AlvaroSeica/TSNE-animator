Typed by: AZ Lyrics

We can watch a DVD baby
Sit up in the house and be, just be there
You ain't gotta get cute for me, truthfully
I prefer you with no make up
In one of my T-shirts
Bunny slippers on your feet, girl
Just tryna' be all up under me
On the coach or in front of TV
Baby that's gansta

Let's just be (girl)
Let's just be
Ain't gon' be no runnin' round in these streets
Just my girl and me
Doin' whatever babe
Lets just be

Dinner from the microwave, okay girl
I'm gon' put my cell away, no distractions
Gonna take this day
To lay around and gather every lazy
Play a video game
Or maybe I'll paint your toenails (I'll sing you a song)
I'll sing you a song if you want me to
Girl it's whatever you wanna do
It's so simple

Let's just be
Let's just be
Ain't gon' be no runnin' round in these streets
Just my girl and me
Doin' whatever babe
Lets just be
[x2]

Wrapped up in my arms
Girl until the morn'
Nothin is better my baby
Soon we'll fall a sleep
Then eventually we'll wake up and I'll be ready

Oh
(Lets just be)
Overcome by passion and lust
(let's just be)
Oh overwhelmed by each others touch
(let's just be)
On the brink of explosion when we
(oh when we)
Girl when we
(be)
When we just be!
Oh girl just be
yeah yeah yeah
Woo wooh

Let's just be
Ain't gon' be no runnin' round in these streets
Just my girl and me
Doin' whatever babe
Lets just be
