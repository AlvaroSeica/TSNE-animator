Song:   Ziggy Says
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Ziggy says lift up your hands
Ziggy says lift up your feet
Ziggy says smile
Ziggy says make the sign of peace

Ziggy says wiggle your waist
Ziggy says wiggle your nose
Ziggy says wiggle your toes
Ziggy says hug who you know

Ziggy says stand real tall
Ziggy says bend real low
Ziggy says look up and down
Ziggy says smile some more

Ziggy says look to the left
Ziggy says look to the right
Ziggy says turn in a circle
Ziggy says stop and say hi

Ziggy says sing like a bird
Ziggy says hiss like a snake
Ziggy says roar like a lion
Ziggy says talk like an ape

Ziggy says close your eyes
Ziggy says open them wide
Ziggy says spread your wings
Ziggy says imagine you can fly

Imagine you can fly
Imagine you can fly

Ziggy says lift your hands
Ziggy says lift up your feet
Ziggy says smile
Ziggy says make the sign of peace

Ziggy says wiggle your waist
Ziggy says wiggle your nose
Ziggy says wiggle your toes
Ziggy says hug who you know

Ziggy says stand real tall
Ziggy says bend real low
Ziggy says look up and down
Ziggy says smile some more

Ziggy says look to the left
Ziggy says look to the right
Ziggy says turn in a circle
Ziggy says stop and say hi

Ziggy says sing like a bird
Ziggy says hiss like a snake
Ziggy says roar like a lion
Ziggy says talk like an ape

Ziggy says close your eyes
Ziggy says open them wide
Ziggy says spread your wings
Ziggy says imagine you can fly

Imagine you can fly
Imagine you can fly
Imagine you can fly
Imagine you can fly
Imagine you can fly

Imagine you can fly
Imagine you can fly
Imagine you can fly
Imagine you can fly
Imagine you can fly

Imagine you can fly
Imagine you can fly
Imagine you can fly

Come on, come on</pre>
