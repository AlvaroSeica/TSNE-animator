Album:  You Gottus Fuxxed Up
Song:   Made Niggaz
Typed by: Lil Hustle

[Chorus - 4x]
We some made niggaz, paid niggaz grave diggers
Hard headed raiders, on a chase for six figgas

[Mike D]
My adversaries, ride off in a hearse
Cause of my crucial injection, that I inflict from my verse
First I'm a blade runner, head hunter dope fronter
Acting bad lick shots, loot from the all black Hummer
My K kick harder, than a junkie's drug habit
Devil's advocate, competition smothered up in plastic
So feel me now, and feel the wrath later
Who's the fucking fader, I'm a billion dollars later

[H.A.W.K.]
I'm an outlaw, knock out throwing southpaw
Leave a scar, when I jab ya on that glass jaw
Heavyweighter, penthouse with an escalator
Floss equator, twenty inches on a Navigator
Annihilator, three time parole violator
Now raider, throwed word pronunciator
Heart breaker, dope game gladiator
28 gram cookie baker, I'm serious bout my paper

[Chorus - 4x]

[Clay-Doe]
I'm a low life thinking, endo stinking
Syrup drinking but no blinking, when these fiends out geeking
Seeking reasons, to shut it down and make an example
Put a fo' up in a Snapple, go get his adam's apple
Dig a grave, fill it with gravel so the smell can't get at ya
For the love of getting this cabbage, I'll burn em in acid
Ain't no thing to taking my time, to get with ya
Clay-Doe about his iss-ya, a young don made nigga

[Big Pokey]
I'm a made nigga, slug spraying like the plague nigga
Sixteen body shots, rain from a gauge nigga
Pistol whipper, key flipper and A gripper
With a corpse in the trunk, headed to the swamp to get dumped
I snatch my money in lumps, come across ditches like bumps
With nice sights in the beam, knocking off players and chumps
See we far from punks, up in this H-Town
Breaking these bricks down, forming a million dollar compound

[Chorus - 4x]

[H.A.W.K.]
Player haters, your ass I'm gon' scorch
Fire up my blunt, off the statue of liberty's torch
Front page of the Source, but you don't feel us though
Stay cocked red dot, feel the heat of my calico

[Big Pokey]
Block bleeders with heaters, like glock 40's and millimeters
Niggaz scared like cheaters, bullets be biting like beavers
See I'm a endo chiefer, to keep from using this street sweeper
Ain't no limit when it comes down, to me and my people

[Clay-Doe]
Family fuck with my G's, and I can guarantee
When you finished with him, you gotta handle me understanding me
Challenge me, and you challenge we
O.G. S.U.C., Laff-Tex zulu my land scheme

[Mike D]
I done told you, bout my first verse
But guess who's last but not lease, making the situation worse
Laff-Tex cast curses, dropping dicks on the dirt
Hard headed raiders, chasing papers when we put in work

[Chorus - 2x]</pre>
