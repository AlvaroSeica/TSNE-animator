[Intro: Holocaust]
Clack, clack, kapow!

[Chorus 2X: Holocaust]
We built our world of metal, stunned west, then futures span
Dark city choosers, The Death of Superman
Black as pitch, perfect blue lantern, grave robbers, Alaska
Hole in the sky, which snake killed Cleopatra?

[Atlantis Scrolls]
Yo, listen up, and shut the fuck up
Turn your stereo, all the way up
And witness the style of the golden ghetto child
Better throw in the towel, right about now
As I crash with telepathy, with epic weaponry
Enemies of my enemy, remember me as memories
Better yet, as a muthafucking legacy
Explosive in doses, I detonate corosive
Swallow the ocean and spit out Poseidon
Form a blazing sword like red and blue lion
V for Vendetta, beretta better bring mega death 'em
Killed so easy, killa, you are not realer
You need to regroup, bring back some troops
Fuck it, bring your moms tomb, I will not lose
No gas mask, no oxygen, breathing toxic fumes
Yo, get out of my face, man, give me some room

[Chorus 2X]

[King Just]
It's the long awaited, thought I was out dated
The greatest to perform on hip hop stages
Captain Courageous, wax 'em, it's contagious
It's a gamble like Vegas, radio scared to play us
Haters can't fade us, like a barber in a chair
I never borrowed from my father, cuz I knew he wasn't there
When and where, name the place and I'll be all in your face
Oh, you a hustler? You can get robbed for the bass
Here's the taste of the preview, before the sequel
It's illegal, lethal, injected into people
Evel Knievel, stink like sour diesel
MC Serch, and 'Pop Goes the Weasel'
Hip hop needs you, that's why I'm here
I don't do it for a career, I do it cuz I care
Bareknuckle brawl, beat down my opponent
I ain't Drake, diss me and you will get a reply for it
Half baked, and I'm still going five on it
Call jake, meaning they gon' drop dime on 'em
Cop caller, safe balling til a tales
Too taller, prepare for New York's onslaughter

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
