[Intro]
Stunting like Baby, pockets all crazy
Stun-stunting like Baby, pockets all crazy - 2x

[Hook]
Got stacks on stacks, just racks on racks
Just hit a lick, and got your income tax
Stunting like Baby, pockets all crazy
Stun-stunting like Baby, pockets all crazy
Got stacks on stacks, just racks on racks
What you know about that, where it's going down at
Stunting like Baby, pockets all crazy
Stun-stunting like Baby, pockets all crazy
Get your hands to the sky, if you love money

[E.S.G.]
You out here, you trapping like Jeezy
Or you rapping like Weezy, see we make it look easy
Big boss like I'm Ros-ay, sipping on some rosay
Will I ever stop grinding, tell them haters no way
Whether fast at a slow way, can't survive with no pay
She ain't stripping for fun homie, ask her bet that hoe say
She gotta feed her babies, she gotta pay her bills
Didn't mean to call you that, Pimp C told me keep it trill
But it's hard out here, for a pimp
Trying to get that money for the rent, laws get broken or get bent g'eah
Now get your haaaaands to the sky, if you love money
Tell them haters keep walking
I don't understand English, all I hear is money talking

[Hook]
Got stacks on stacks, just racks on racks
What you know about that, where it's going down at
Stunting like Baby, pockets all crazy
Stun-stunting like Baby, pockets all crazy
Got stacks on stacks, just racks on racks
Just hit a lick, and got your income tax
Stunting like Baby, pockets all crazy
Stun-stunting like Baby, pockets all crazy

[Harvey Luv]
It's cash on stash, if you know about me
But they don't understand, when I be blowing my G's
I'm a fo' tray shaker, and a 52 baker
Ooh I'm a damn fool, about my mo'fucking paper
Eyes all bucked, where the fuck this nigga came from
Whip with the gadgets, they think I'm James Bond
It ain't no secrets, tell you what you wanna know
Plus I wreck the valet, it's wherever you wanna go
Just looking for some ladies, that wanna double dip
And she hate my honesty, cause I shoot right from the hip
They loving the way I flip em though, keep em on they tippy-toe
Let em know it's a Rosay show, better get some mo' and sip it slow
They think you plain Jane, till they see the price
Are you a cold nigga, is it me or the ice
Seeker than a spider, let her see the Prada
Got her, and I can't tell you nothing else about her

[Hook]
Got stacks on stacks, just racks on racks
Just hit a lick, and got your income tax
Stunting like Baby, pockets all crazy
Stun-stunting like Baby, pockets all crazy
Got stacks on stacks, just racks on racks
What you know about that, where it's going down at
Stunting like Baby, pockets all crazy
Stun-stunting like Baby, pockets all crazy

[E.S.G.]
Now is the kid and he kidding, no matter how you make a living
Hell yeah I hustle hard, got it jumping like Blake Griffin
We at Sak's spending racks, I showed her how to ball
Javale McGee on her dog, she let me dunk both my balls
Now tell me where my hogs, trying to overload the stash
Gorilla uniform, he ain't worried bout no swag
And anytime you ask, why he out here on the cuts
Hit us a rock that say Barak, and only do so much
I'm talking Aston Martin plus, Louie Chuck's and Gucci sneakers
A chick named Tamika, love to smoke with Wiz Khalifa
Now this one for my people, who grinding and been hustling
Make the weight disappear, I ain't talking Jennifer Hudson huh
Now get your haaaaands to the sky, if you love money

Stunting like Baby, pockets all crazy
Stun-stunting like Baby, pockets all crazy - 8x</pre>
