CHORUS:
Is it bad that I never made love? No, I never did it
But I sure know how to fuck
I'll be your bad boy, I'll prove it to you
I can't promise that I'll be good to you
'Cause I have some issues, I won't commit
No, not having it
But at least I can admit that I'll be bad noooooo to you (to you, to you)
Yeah, I'll be good in bed but I'll be bad to you
Bad that I never made love, no I never did it
But I sure know how to fuck

I shoulda known a player's work's really never done, I'm sorry that we can't together hun
Don't assume that my heart is immune, just the girl before you fully ruined it for every one
Before her I didn't know what a hug mean, and I ain't a nigga reppin' the thug scene
In the fight of my life but in what ring? Knocked out cold, never felt such suffering
Bad...oooh who knew a serial killer could be so beautiful?
She made dude a fool, thoughts we each had a suitable settle down mate weren't mutual
Had my playboy days all behind me, rear view mirror status to the grimey
Figured I hit every G spot in the T-dot, so what we got's bound to define me
As a real man, step it up, actually time to face facts
Nigga, you been hitting these chickens for so long, now the one you in love with has finally traced back?
Come on, talk kiss blaze sleep wake repeat bathe leave, dope dress hope stress
She cleaned up well but left me in a big mess

CHORUS:
Is it bad that I never made love? No, I never did it
But I sure know how to fuck
I'll be your bad boy, I'll prove it to you
I can't promise that I'll be good to you
'Cause I have some issues, I won't commit
No, not having it
But at least I can admit that I'll be bad noooooo to you (to you, to you)
Yeah, I'll be good in bed but I'll be bad to you

She hurt feelings, she break hearts, I gotta admit, I didn't play it smart
Been too long, came on too strong, shoulda known it would end up as a new song
Said I loved her, she ain't say it back, feeling like she need a life on a straight track
It's complicated how do I face that? Getting mad at God, thinkin' I'mma take a prayer back
Can't put my eggs only in this basket, guess I'm destined to be a lonely bastard
Taking all my dreams about making us a team just to break 'em up and throw 'em in a casket
Bad noooo...Better off if I bury that marry that feeling I've rarely had
By comparison a car wreck ain't barely bad, got a nigga feeling very wack like a severed back
It was masochistic self-torture, ignoring my better judgment to deport her
But she was mine for a time, told myself I wasn't blind to what losing her again would cost ya
Chill eat cuddle bed sex sweat double head, crash bounce future link
Dissed for another nigga, what was I to think?

CHORUS:
Is it bad that I never made love? No, I never did it
But I sure know how to fuck
I'll be your bad boy, I'll prove it to you
I can't promise that I'll be good to you
'Cause I have some issues, I won't commit
No, not having it
But at least I can admit that I'll be bad noooooo to you (to you, to you)
Yeah, I'll be good in bed but I'll be bad to you
Bad that I never made love, no I never did it
But I sure know how to fuck</pre>
