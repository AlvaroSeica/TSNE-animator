Typed by: kirenamloh@msn.com

"Please, please, please listen! I've got one or two things to say" 

   "TELL US! TELL US BOTH OF THEM!"

"Look, you've got it all wrong! 
 You don't NEED to follow ME! 
 You don't NEED to follow ANYBODY! 
 You've got to think for your selves! 
 You're ALL individuals! 

[Rapper Big Pooh]
Yeah.. I put my pants on one leg at a time
I ain't no super nigga, hah!

Yo, it go arm, leg, leg, arm, head
Niggaz gon' keep hatin on you 'til you dead
Palm over palm, embalmed in the casket
Screamin out that team shit, you been mislead
Recallin all the bullshit stories you've been fed
So many lies, you can sop a piece of bread
Say they want the truth, runaway poof
Wanna die slow, death hang 'em by a noose
Knock 'em off the roof, heard 'em say I had the +Juice+
Perception is a muh'fucker, dog I need proof
Your stories I truce, livin life on recluse
Follow any man, naw nigga I refuse
My feet big enough to only step in my shoes
The lie and belief means they lyin on the news
Shake 'em so fake shit, I give away jewels
Live by another code, we make our own rules - WE MOVE~!
Most of y'all just preparin to lose
Fallin victim to the light, ignorin the clues
I go to sleep, let my dreams be the muse
I wake up from my dreams, amused

"Follow my lead on this jou-rney"
