Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Jumps on the stage, up in cloud rain
Feeling like Jakes the money ain't a thang
Jumps in the game, now you know my name
Feeling like a young star, what can I say
Jumps on the stage, up in cloud rain
Feeling like Jakes the money ain't a thang
Jumps in the game, now you know my name
Feeling like a young star, what can I say

Bottle with that Rose, baby girl know she
Keep on doing that there ain't no way they could control me
Take another round would be cutting like a ranger
How come all the pretty girl wanna Bei Major?
Hold up, break it down
I just wanna hear what that new shit sounds
And I wanna feel what your body feel like
Girl I wanna feel what your body feel like
Everybody hold up, break it down
I just wanna hear what that new shit sounds
And I wanna feel what your body feel like
Girl I wanna feel what your body feel like
Everybody take it to the ground
I just wanna hear what that new shit sounds
And I wanna feel what your body feel like
Girl I wanna feel what your body feel like

I can sound chubby, pretty girls love me
Hit it from behind and I start to hit my doggy
All star days, rockstar nights
Do it how we do it, we just do it how we do it
I can sound chubby, pretty girls love me
Hit it from behind and I start to hit my doggy
All star days, rockstar nights
Do it how we do it, we just live it our lives
Bottle with that berry on fly shit what we be on
I went on a trip and I brought her like a carrion
Take another round would be [?]
How come all the pretty girls wanna Bei Major?

Hold up, break it down
I just wanna hear what that new shit sounds
And I wanna feel what your body feel like
Girl I wanna feel what your body feel like
Everybody hold up, break it down
I just wanna hear what that new shit sounds
And I wanna feel what your body feel like
Girl I wanna feel what your body feel like
Hold up, break it down
I just wanna hear what that new shit sounds
And I wanna feel what your body feel like
Girl I wanna feel what your body feel like
Everybody hold up, break it down
I just wanna hear what that new shit sounds
And I wanna feel what your body feel like
Girl I wanna feel what your body feel like
Everybody take it to the ground
This right here with that new shit sound like
And I wanna feel what your body feel like
Girl I wanna feel what your body feel like</pre>
