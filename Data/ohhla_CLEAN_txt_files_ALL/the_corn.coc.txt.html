[Bloodshed]
Yeah, yeah Bloodshed
My nigga Mase Murder, the deal
Big L, Killa Cam
Let 'em know where you been Killa

[Cam'Ron]
I went to Texas people, caught wreck with people
Who had injection infected needles, some terrorist people
Baby burst the desert eagles, killa slices
Cold as the icisis, one of the trifest
Hypest to shiestest y'all run like mices in a crisis
Y'all never hear nobody did me in
I be in Lebanon with Libyans, now it's just Caribbean
I blow fucking tally on, cause I got money pals on tours
Selling big thousand on crack, smack and Tylenol
All I got's the crack option, 031's what I wrap boxing
In '89 when I was slap boxing, now I box on padlocking
And gat cocking and gat poppin', doing drive bys out the black drops
I ain't little but vicious, guns no misses
You feel me, kisses or wishes, before I break you up like dishes
Fuck your bosses, my forces, it tosses
To kill all your sources you niiggaz best be cautious
No losses my fortress, is Jaguars and Porsches
Ride the OTB to check my money on the horses
My horrors is flawless, my block one of the broadest
Off the main attraction on the mighty ass chorus
That I tosses, it scorches, with out no remorses
Leave their bloody body to be counted in Mount Morris
Harlem leave you scoreless, I shoot your bitch and leave you broad less
So if you want we can start the static like a cordless

[Mase]
I'm only getting what I'm bless with
All that good and Guess shit, connected
With kis, caught the country out respected
Leave stake, while in each state, in my peep's waist
D's while they ducking these, trying to keep Mase
Good fiend a police take, only seen my D's face
I'm running from some beings with a million in my briefcase
Navigate, passed the state, with half a cake
Let's placalate, my continents in any placid lake
Blast holes for Gs, and G's is what my chest holds
So much ice on my neck, I might catch a chest cold
Vexed are varyin', I'm known to scare vary' man
When I bring beef niggaz like be vegetarians
Take them opium, when the glock hits the pen
He better watch out his peephole, my people come to see him
Fuck the drama, all my niggaz bring that on the reg
And infra-red beam is on your head, by time you see it y'all be dead

[Bloodshed]
I run with +Wildcats+ like +Villanova+
Y'all smoke crack and kill Jehovah
Before you bump into this villain sober
Causing the controversy that niggaz be illing over
To have the children who be killin, in your building killin
My skills is trife as hitting scriptures from Hitler
And if I'm out to get ya give ya mom a picture
Cause she'll miss ya, I roll with sniffers that annihilate
So if you try to violate, I have 'em under pressure like a trail date
Even if you tried you couldn't get with it
That last nigga that tried was crucified with his shit splitted
I pull the plug so all the chest get going
Cause my tech be blowing
So hard it leaves vest and large intestines showing
God I peeped you, go ahead and try to set it
But don't act speedy, or get beat, cause I can't stand it like a diabetic
Peace to hustlas, with integaras and cellular
And 1-80 scars across their jaws and their jugulars</pre>
