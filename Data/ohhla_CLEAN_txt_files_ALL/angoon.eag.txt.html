Boy: Where's Angoon?

THIS IS ANGOON
Repping the South East, somewhere ANG's is in Admiralty
THIS IS ANGOON
The home town of my Tlingits 99 82, OH!
THIS IS ANGOON
It's my zip code, go to my state: ALASKA
THIS IS ANGOON
then go to Angoon, that is my destination

This is Angoon, Alaska 907 straight representa
T.N.T on this track, I know you been waiting
Took some time, took some debatin'
There's nothing' about me that's fakin'
So don't mistake it.
I'm an Angoon representa 'til I die
I'm a native we don't cry,
We sit back and we sigh
"Be strong, son" I don't know how many times I heard it.
Angoon, South East Alaska
A low cap city, put a star on the map
What's this crap? Why can't we just all get along?
Fightin' for all the wrong reasons
Aiming their words like their guns
(CLICK CLACK)
Hunting season year round
And all you hear is (GUN SHOTS)
What's that sound?
That's another good person hitting the ground

THIS IS ANGOON
Repping the South East, somewhere ANG's is in Admiralty
THIS IS ANGOON
The home town of my Tlingits 99 82, OH!
THIS IS ANGOON
It's my zip code, go to my state: ALASKA
THIS IS ANGOON
then go to Angoon, that is my destination

[Swerv Merv]
Living a village life isnt bad
Don't have to worry about the drive-by
or people shooting each other
The only thing we go is drama music in my heart
I liked it from the start, I feel so tall
Cuz everyone looks up to me
I'd like to thank God I breathe 24/7
When I die, I hope I go to Heaven
I get my lyrics from being out on the dock
When I turned around, I see my block
And I sit here wondering why God put me on the rock
Why is it when I'm by myself, I can freestyle real good
But when it comes to writing or recording a track
I feel like I'm nervous and stage fright
I feel like the Earth is half Heaven and half Hell
I wish the whole world could put all the hate
And killing and beating in a garbage bag, throw it away
We don't need them
Everyone should be Giving a life of chance
Because God only gave us one life to live

THIS IS ANGOON
Repping the South East, somewhere ANG's is in Admiralty
THIS IS ANGOON

THIS IS ANGOON
