[Intro]
Ahhhhh! For you!
(La, la, la, la-lah
 La, la, la, la-lah
 La, la, la, la-lah, how you like it?
 La, la, la, la-lah)
Thank you, thank you, uh...
 
[Common]
Bow! BOW! I came through the door 
with the raw Martin Margiela superstar status
Everything stellar, with some bad bitches 
and some ex-drugs sellers, niggaz already jealous
We in this joint like Bob Marley and The Wailers
She already wanna pick, bitch don't be so overzealous
Go to the bar to get around like a propeller
The barmaid's name is Stella
I'm so ap-Paul-ed like McCartney that you would card me
Am I really mad? Hardly, I'm here to party!
Wantin y'all to give me body like Lati-fah
Niggaz in the corner smokin that ree-fa
Seen a girl she had bottom like a speak-a
Wanna put some hands on her like a preach-a
Hmmmm-uh~! Well let me take my time
She ordered Bacardi, gettin twisted in the lime-light
Seen that ass cause I got hind-sight
She was lit shinin bright in a fit that was tight
'Bout to get that invite to a +Night Over Egypt+
She said "You rap?" Yea, mummy
I'm Tutankhamun/Common kickin and spendin this rap money
 
[Chorus: Hannah Sidibe]
Feels so good, I wanna touch somebody
So let's go, go wanna feel you 
close, keep touchin
Feels so good, I wanna touch somebody
So let's go, go... 
Feel you close, keep touchin
La, la, la, la-lah, how you like it?
La, la, la, la-lah, how you like it?
La, la, la, la-lah, how you like it?
La, la, la, la-lah 
 
[Common]
She was all couture, in a Tom Ford
Security guard let me in 'cause I'm +Lord+
of +Finesse+, the under, the rings, the dress -
code is to always stay fresh
Aware of a chest 'cause, I stay abreast
She was extra cold, I'm here to decongest
This nigga next to us was slopped and made a mess
Knockin over bar stools, I hoped that he carpooled
I'm locked into my mood, long as dude don't disturb my groove
I won't have to take it back to high school
RE-WIND~! No need to take me back in time
Keep my mind on the grind and the great feline
'cause what's in front of me is this behind
Up north she's thick, down south she's fine
Tuned in to what I'm doin
I'm so unassuming when I'm pursuing
The ladies! The ladies! A +Soldier of Love+ like Sa-de
Showin love to this lady when this nigga tried to play me
Saw me talkin to +Slim+ and started actin +Shady+
Dude got foul like crack in the 80s'
Uh, uh, uh, uh! You don't wanna test this, yo
You never know who got a Tec up in the disco
(You Hollywood) Nah nigga, I'm Chicago
So I cracked his head with a motherfuckin bottle
 
[Chorus]

Oooooooh-ooh-ooh-ooooooh-ooh-ooooh</pre>
