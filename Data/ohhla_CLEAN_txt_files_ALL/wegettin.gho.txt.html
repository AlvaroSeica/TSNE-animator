DJ On Point: Brand new Cig, we call this shit We Gettin' Fucked Up
Tonight...shout out to the whole Staten Island
Cig: Yeah! Ghostown! Cig! You got 5 seconds to move from the bar to the dance floor
DJ On Point: DJ On Point, Ghostown, the Forgotten Borough, the mixtape volume 3
Cig: Time's up, lets go!

[Cig]
Tell me how you want it, missionary or back shots?
Cause I'm a visionary when it comes to the yak shots
Still real, you could find me down in the crack spots
Brown bagged 40 when we chillin' in back lots
I get chicks, while chicks look best in the nude
I get chicks, so they stay stressin' this dude
Her boyfriend hate me while I'm nestlin' tools
Wanna give my head scissors, ain't no restlin' moves
Quit testin' me dude, or you're gonna see the lead bite
Cig stay plottin' on who could get spread slight
Scoop her by 1 and she into the bed right?
Know by 2 I'm gettin' blown more then red lights
Cig killed the rap game, they mourn in death
Fight over a girl? please, I'm yawnin' threats
Cause I fuck like I ain't got a mornin' left
Only thing you wakin' up with is mornin' breath so!

[Chorus]
I know you wanna smoke with me, I know you wanna drink with me
I know you wanna cut with me, cause we gettin' fucked up tonight!

I know you wanna smoke with me, I know you wanna drink with me
I know you wanna cut with me, cause we gettin' fucked up tonight!

[Cig]
I ain't one to be fucked with, I'm sparin' the rest
Digest these clips, till they inch hair on your chest
So who wants to battle? Who's darin' to test?
You couldn't see me mo' fucker in a starin' contest
Catch Formz on the block movin' 40 sticks
Me and Ceaz in the club with like 40 chicks
Yosh bring the shorties, surely for me to twist
Squash beef when we roll up with 40 whips
All eyes on the kid soon as Christopher walked in
Lot of chicks in the club be Christopher stalkin'
When I rap they listen to when Christophers talkin'
Rappers is great actors like Christopher Walken
Ice grills? please, you stay jokin' you hard
We smoke piff that stays soakin' out the jar
Smashin' biddies while you stay scopin' out the bar
I'm with a dime dog, smokin' out the car, lets go!

[Chorus 2X]
I know you wanna smoke with me, I know you wanna drink with me
I know you wanna cut with me, cause we gettin' fucked up tonight!

I know you wanna smoke with me, I know you wanna drink with me
I know you wanna cut with me, cause we gettin' fucked up tonight!

[Outro]
Cig: Yeah! hate harder man, you're just motivating me to get better! Cig
Ghostown! Meet me at the bar, shots on the biddies, lets go</pre>
