[Lil' Fame] We got one way of life to live and if not, flatline

[Chorus]
Gone tomorrow (uhuh)
Here Today, gone tomorrow (huh)
Gone tomorrow (naw nigga)
Here today, gone tomorrow(uhuh)

[Lil' Fame] Hay where the man say
(Breath nigga)

[Lil' Fame]
I was told to shoot out and lay low
Keep firin, keep extra clip for extra shit
Who's next to flip on the cat with the velcro slap
Most shady yeah Brownsville baby, baby
Dub ezzo izzim's he can you faggots bimo with a semi A you two matic
Cal Colt 45 and also with my Billy D nigga

[Billy Danze] And he ain't talkin bout malt liquor it's me the big O
[Lil' Fame] Who was straight for the tech fake shit

[Lil' Fame] Fuck it I reserved that crack
[Billy Danze] True dat

[Lil' Fame]
I'm In the streets I know how the scores lookin with the smallest

And this here thing (Gun Cocking) I here hold in my hand make a trigger

[Chorus] (Here Today Gone Tomorow)
Damn I was just here with him somebody hit 'em (Gone tomorrow)

[Billy Danze]
We already made a note of it the new school is based on some cobra shit
You might not make it past the top of the mornin
these young nigga's be cocominnd gunnin wit no warning
But Bill onon topf that we can stop rap
take two steps back and get it going in the street
I do it with a papassionhen blastin on competition
Over lookin cops and ququitter no matter when tomission's metal intomission's
it's gheeto intwishin, heavy amunition (We all stray)
The truth is we need to be ruthless
they wanna look at us like animals zoo kids
(All day) We gunnin down in Brooklyn
some shit that you could never overlookin
You could be

[Chorus] {beat stops} 

[Chorus] - 4X to fade</pre>
