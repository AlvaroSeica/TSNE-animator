[Intro: Inspectah Deck]
Yeah, This for all my Shaolin niggas man
For all my one-six ohh, Killa Hill riders yaknawmean
We bout to put the rock back in your face
I've been hearin the talks
Niggas tryna front on my dudes man
I hope yall ready

[Chorus 2X: Inspectah Deck]
What's it all about, What's it all about
What you talkin bout clown, What's it all about

[Inspectah Deck]
I'm bout to air it out, And I don't care about
Them on lookers in the way son, clear em out
And watch your mouth, Or get pounded out
That's with out a doubt the hard way you found it out
So walk it out, We can't talk it out
Find yourself with your top roll fallin out
It's the fall out, And I'm all out
Want it bad with the kid then call it out
It's on now, It's goin down
I'm head checkin like jail, Niggas on the count
You wanna shout, You ballin now
Code name Paper Boy, I stay on the route
Gettin large amounts, I done lost the count
Don't be hate'n, Don't be jealous how the baller bounce
I show em how, I blow em out
What you talkin bout clown, What's it all about

[Chorus 2: Inspectah Deck]
What's it all about, What's it all about
What you talkin bout clown, What's it all about
What you talkin bout, What you talkin bout
What's it all about clown, What you talkin bout

[Inspectah Deck]
What you know about, How I throw it down
It's one tenth of my strength, Son I'm holdin out
Big blowers out, Dick hoes about
I'm T. Coded out, Hazed up, Blow an ounce
Yo, I'm a..

[Outro: Inspectah Deck]
Yo son, Chill-Chill-Chill nigga, It's over man
You aint even gotta spray them niggas like that man
You got the Gatling gun out
And it only call for a twenty-two for these dudes man
