Now you can blame it on the blunts and beer
Or my utter lack of fear when I'm draggin in her ear
Like, ain't no commitments girl, we just kickin it right?
Laughin at the prophylactic I just slipped it inside (ahh)
Cause I ain't trippin I like runnin raw daddy
Not knowin nine months from that moment I'll be called daddy
All mad and indignant when I heard the news
Cursin, trippin but it was COOL when I was diggin it
But now it's bitch (BEEITCH!) this and it's ho that
And it's a lot of other words that I can't hold back
Man I don't want no kids, girl you KNOW that
But shit, you barely know my name let alone where my dome at
We got it on way before that
Didn't know, or hadn't even seen her sober
Only thought in my mind was getting over
Now the seat I saved her bout to drop (woo!)
And all I do is clutch my bottle and wallow in sorrow
With each swallow, livin for yesterday (man FUCK tomorrow!)
All my accusations and allegations, they ring hollow
Cause I ain't got nobody in the world to blame but me (I know, I know)

Chorus:
(Pep Love)
What you are is what you do
You better watch yourself cause they're watching you
Your own mistakes could be your biggest obstacles
But if you believe, you can achieve the impossible

(Pep Love) and [Tajai]
[Now if you full of regrets that's on you (on you)]
(And if you don't know what to do that's on you (on you))
[You can't get no respect?  That's on you (on you)]
(And if you're without a clue that's on you (on you))

(Pep Love)
He always wanted to have shit
Cause this nigga never had shit
It, even influenced him to get into bad shit
Like, shoplifting and, party crashin
All for the cash and fashion, he smashin
But, he was smarter than the average shit starter
Had it all planned out, how he was going to Harvard
Hard as it seems, he was working toward his dreams
But still into things, never for the surrendering
So (so), when the wind blows, his ten toes, wiggle
And then he's out of his bedroom window
Livin in the moment doing whatever he wanted
When his homework is done, he's livin in another zone
With his crimies, breakin into cars and houses
Thinkin his getaway's clean, but how's about this?
One of his boys got caught and snitched
Sayin that he was the mastermind of all this shit
The same day, his letter of acceptance came
The boys came to get him as his mother stood breathless
He couldn't explain, hung his head in shame
Later found his college career was down the drain
Even though he beat the case, it was all over
The local newspaper, a complete disgrace
It read "Teen Prodigy Suspect In Robbery"
Young, black and intelligent, somewhat of an oddity (oddity)
When he went to visit the school, the dean of admissions was like
"Sorry, you're not Harvard material
Plus, you have an arrest record at best (at best)
Reflecting a decadent past, application rejected."

Chorus

(Pep Love) and [Tajai]
[Now if you get caught slippin that's on you (on you)]
(And if your pockets is flat, that's on you (on you))
[And if you're mad and trippin that's on you (on you)]
(If you dazed and confused, that's on you (on you))

(Pep Love) and [Tajai]
(Yo, what you are is what you do)
[You'd best to, watch yourself cause they're watching you]
(They're thinkin of washin you)
[That's why we humble and caution you]
(To keep a failsafe in your arsenal)
[Sometimes it's too late to start anew]
(So recognize) [and realize it's real lives you may jeapordize]
(One'll be your own) [if you blind to what's going on]
(You can get caught up in a bind) [and get your mind blown]
[Find a zone to refine your soul cause time is SO elusive]
(People are so intrusive) [judge not]
(But yet, you shall be judged) [every time your broke your word]
(Every time you held a grudge) [too proud to budge]
(A nigga too loud to hush)
(Tryin ta be a stud muffin when you really a pound of puff)
[Shit you swept to the side kept pilin up]
(I guess you didn't think the consequences was vile enough)
[You should've thought long range] long range
(Look into your own thang) [own thang]
([And don't complain, what you manifest returns from whence it came])
([Live and learn when you try to go against the grain, man])

Chorus

[Now if you can't keep a job that's on you (on you)]
(And if you don't know what to do that's on you (on you))
[And if you can't keep a broad that't on you (on you]
(And if you're without a clue, that's on you (on you))

Chorus

(Pep Love) and [Tajai]
[Now if you get caught slippin that's on you (on you)]
(And if your pockets is flat, that's on you (on you))
[And if you're mad and trippin that's on you (on you)]
(If you dazed and confused, that's on you (on you))

[Tajai talking]
Know what I'm sayin?  Niggas always want to point the finger,
And they point the finger at the man in the mirror, psych out, yeah.</pre>
