Typed by: Lcstyle@Hotmail.com

Yeah, yeah, yeah, 
a superhero in the flesh
even at my worst I'm the best for the finish I stretch
when they advance me this check
could've bought my way to heaven but I blow it on my neck
instead what you expect when you ain't have shit
and they ain't paying half of what you asking
couldn't even see the pussy even if it's Cassie
lot of hoe's is down for taking pictures cause you're flashin'
you can't even imagine maybe Kim Kardashian
number one song get a grammy now I'm smashin
Maserati crashin' swerving through the traffic
wrap it round a pole sell a mil off the tragedy
I defy gravity
flyer than I have to be
talking to the Lord I can't stay
who gone save hip-hop after me
that's like a torn ACL to an athlete
Boobie Miles friday light capture me
In my hometown... 

[Chorus]
King City, King, King City 
Third Third Coast Representer Mississippi Switchin Lanes 
King City, King, King City, 
Third Third Coast Representer Mississippi Switchin Lanes
300 my my 300 my stomping ground
300 my my 300 my stomping ground
300 my my 300 my stomping ground
King City M-Town hometown hero

Yeah, yeah, it's just Ciroq in the cooler
not a day off but I'm still Ferris Bueller
winners never lose so how dare you confuse us
they quote what I spit like Confucius
he say she say rumors all day
the rap game is high school and life's a hallway
like what click you in the Beamer or the Benz
the Bentley or the Lambo like here we going again
don't sit at my table VIP I got this
you ain't poppin champagne after every game then don't pop shit
homecoming queen with my picture in her locket
but I know what's up with her hands in my pockets
they love me cause my swag is so jockish
freshman year I saw a ring like I'm boxin'
you voted most likely to never ever top this
I'm Michael Jordan Dennis Rodman's
in my hometown

[Chorus]

Of my world of my world 
yeah
of my world of my world 
yeah</pre>
