Girl: Into you, into me, into you, into me {*2X*}

(Intro: repeat 2X)
Dear you, even though I can't be near you
This is something that I'm here to do
I know it might appear to you to be shady but since you made me chose
Yo, hip hop is my lady so I guess you lose

(Verse 1: Asheru)
Before we met I was in my own little world
You brought me into yours so I made you my girl
Bickering was at a minimum, really non existince
Kind of strange but I guess the only thing consistint is change
So I Paid it no mind, enjoyed spening my time
Writing rhymes, was so fluid nothing to it to do it
Even did our little shows, you lauged at the groupies
We called them little ho's, whose booties in tight clothes
But it didn't matter, because everynight closed the same way the day opened
We laid nose to nose, just a touch said I loved you so much
Now I can't even imagine what in the world happen...

[Hook]
Dear you, you know that I care for you
That when it's all said and done I'll be there for you
Their a'int no other way that I can make this clear to you
But Hip Hop is something that I want to share with you
Dear you, I'm writing this letter to prepare you
For better or worse with each and every verse that I write
May insight guide me to be near you
but until then I'll have no choice but to continue

(Verse 2: Asheru)
It's been hard days, ever since we had to part ways
The music is why you left, I could'et beg you to stay
The recipe for doing what is best for me
Especially durring this time is just to let me be
But...of course I like support
No man is an island of fights, the drama
the wildin' trying to keep me from smiling
And a mile in my shoes won't explain my situation
I'll be as underlying, half us ???????
But the love remains like the blood in my veins
Joy and pain is like the sun and the rain and yin and yang
To the things we hold dear... love, life and career
I wish you nothing but the best with that... I say cheers...

[Hook]
Dear you, even though I can't be near you
This is something that I'm here to do
I know it might appear to you to be shady but since you made me chose
Yo, hip hop is my lady so I guess you lose (Like I said Girl)
Dear You, you know that I care for you
That when it's all said and done I'll be there for you
Their ain't no other way that I can make this clear to you
But Hip Hop is something that I want to share with you
Dear You, I'm writing this letter to prepare you
For better or worse with each and every verse that I write
May insight guide me to be near you
but until then I'll have no choice but to continue

Dear You... Dear You
