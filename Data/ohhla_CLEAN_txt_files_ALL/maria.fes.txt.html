[Hook: Michael Jackson "Maria' sample]
If you're on that lonely night
What's my life without you girl
I'm so lonely, I'm so blue
Without you darling, my life is through

[Chorus: Michael Jackson "Maria" sample]
Maria, Maria don't you hear me calling, Maria
Maria, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey Maria

[Fes Taylor]
Baby listen to me, now it's kinda differen for me
No more hand to hand, got some niggas pitching for me
I know your sister saw me, in front of 240
Chilling with my new shorty, hopping out the 740
See my life gory, you wanna glamour and glitch
You had me creeping with the hammer ever since
I was bent, you made me bleed right on the cement
Still we had a seed, feeling it was heaven sent
So I went, tried and change the game, calling me back
We separated going at it like Kobe and Shaq
Felt like you was holding me back, even though you kept me
Fresh in my pockets, I was holding the stack
I'm so thankful for showing me that
But the pigs always harassing, knowing we rap
Ma, I think I'm bout to fall back, it ain't even the same
Friends snitching on friends, it'll never change

[Chorus w/ Fes Taylor ad-libs]

[Fes Taylor]
I first met her uptown, 145th
She was in the diner talking to this Dominican kid
I slid, took a seat, we proceeded to speak
She said she had an ill connect, she can get it for cheap
Less than 30 a grizzy, and make back sixty
But I only do business no less than fifty
I'm thinking, Benjy's crispy, how can I flip these
Ki's like quarter p's, not from Mickey D's
And I bought some G's, spent a buck 50 on these
So it look like I was shopping, I copped them and leave
But this rap money make me wanna chill like my wrist be
Introduce you to my little man, you gon' me
