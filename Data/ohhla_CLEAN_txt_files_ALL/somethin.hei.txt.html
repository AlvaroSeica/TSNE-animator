[Verse 1: Felix]
The dirty ceiling needs a cleanin', floors been beat
I stand for hours before the show, band pictures on the wall
Load the gear in, feelin' like I know I'm not far from home
But this place feels really different from St. Paul
It ain't all sting, my friends are around me
My cell phone, headphones, band, and microphone
I haven't eaten' nothing but a continental breakfast
Thanks to Motel 6 for throwin' a dog a bone
One can hardly feel alone with all these pictures
Press shots, you know the ones that you're supposed to sign
Tonight the stage is ours, we don't have that picture
That picture ain't us, I'll make the memory shine
(Doors) Hey Mr. DJ
Would you flip it like the loser at a bullfight?
Spin it like tequila with just a little bite?
Twist it like a doorknob? Let's start the night
The extended family is the crowd and they're here
You're skeptical at first, but I'm glad that you cheer
I don't get stage fright but Twinkie gets nervous
dVRG dons the glasses and commence service

[Hook: Muad'Dib]
Stand up, stretch, hit the roof
Bounce off the walls and shake the rafters loose, that's the truth
Man I wanna see somebody jumpin'
Ain't no way y'all are gettin' somethin' for nothin'
Visualize and execute, that's it, keep movin'
We told you it's not worse than pullin' a tooth
Man I wanna see everybody jumpin'
We can't let y'all get somethin' for nothin'

[Verse 2: Felix]
On stage I pace like a tiger
Yes, Felix is a cat and I've got cats at home
I know exactly how they feel when they lookin' out the window
My windows on the stage just your side of the microphone
I'm lookin' at you, feel the eyes burnin'
Intensity is buildin', unconcerned with any person
It's just the mass that counts
Make 'em bounce till the sweat oozes out
Don't leave 'em with one ounce
Stalk your crew like ya animal's mindset
Take a little breath and share a few of those words with you and yours
Let me pace my space, maybe you'll see 'em feed me
I promise you before the end you'll see me roar

[Hook: Muad'Dib]
Stand up, stretch, hit the roof
Bounce off the walls and shake the rafters loose, that's the truth
Man I wanna see somebody jumpin'
Ain't no way y'all are getting' somethin' for nothin'
Visualize and execute, that's it, keep movin'
We told you it's not worse than pullin' a tooth
Man I wanna see everybody jumpin'
We can't let y'all get somethin' for nothin'

[Verse 3: Felix]
Day-to-day drama weighs down my shoulders
I'm just too generous with limits
A sucker born every minute, they say
Maybe I'm a sucker but at least I'm not timid
Push the gimmicks to the left, integrity is to the right
Look through the middle at the floor, feel the stomach roar
This is still about the vibe in this place
Show them, I'm realer than Chris Rock's hair in CB4
I see the door but then leavin' means defeat
If I take a seat the local sharks will think that I'm weak
I've done this before, shit you've done this before
So you know that's all to do is hold it down like a bungee cord
On stage there's an education to be had
The front row wants to teach you when they want it that bad
The middle wants to nod their heads and give approval
Soundman teaches mic technique and wants your removal
Now there's work and there's play, there's worse and OK
And on a perfect day I can do both
Some days my teachers put me at the front of the class
Other days I do all of my work and yet they're still in my throat
This is the kind of night that when they raise the lights
The drinkin' doesn't stop it just moves outside
BYOB: "bring your own bullshit"
I'll stay indoors, I learned a lot
Thanks for the ride

[Hook: Muad'Dib]

We told you it's not worse than pullin' a tooth
Man I wanna see everybody jumpin'
We can't let y'all get somethin' for nothin'
