[Kangol Slim]

Up Early N Tha Morning, I jump sheib,
Me kick the funky reggae but me don't know why,
Because I'm sloooooowed,
And all these hoes know,
I go by the name of little Kangol

Chorus [Partners-N-Crime]:

I'm up Early N Tha Morning,
Hoes can never catch lil' Kangol falling,
Up Early N Tha Morning,
Hoes can never catch lil' Kangol falling,

First Verse [Kangol Slim]:

I'm up Early N Tha Morning, shall I say about six o' clock?
Bout a fifty and slab, and got a couple of rocks,
Broke about twelve, then I chilled on my set,
Brought along my two friends, that's my nine and my Tec,
Now I'm coming of age, and I start to having dreams,
That I'm, dead or full of lead, two shots to my fuckin' head,
It's a god damn shame that I'm still in this dope game,
I think I'm in the game for the fortune and fame,
Gotta stay on top, hoes can never catch me falling,
I'm up Early N Tha Morning

Chorus:

I'm up Early N Tha Morning,
Hoes can never catch lil' Kangol falling,
Up Early N Tha Morning,
Hoes can never catch lil' Kangol falling

Second Verse [Misdemeanor]:

Up Early N Tha Morning,
I catch my yawning,
I call out my hoe, cuz my nature got me horny,
I get dressed in a second, when it comes to a fuck,
Cuz a nigga like Demeanor's, all about them guts,
I take no slack on them hoes, that's why I'm up early in the morn,
I bring the same hoes at night, and then be fucked by the dawn,
I'm battle rammin' the cat,
I'm stickin' that ass in the back,
Up and down, side to side you know I like it like that,
So all you hoes get it straight, I'm not your ideal mate,
I just like fuckin' them hoes and breakin' them hoes, and outty y'all break,
So all you niggas that's stuntin' and braggin' that you bout to bone her,
It's too late niggas I'm Up Early N Tha Mornin',
Up Early N Tha Mornin', I jump sheib,
I grab me two rubbers and I bone outside,
Because I'm slooooowed, and all these hoes know,
I'm down with Prime Time and my nigga Kangol

Chorus:
I'm up Early N Tha Morning,
Hoes can never catch Demeanor falling,
Up Early N Tha Morning,
Hoes can never catch lil' Demeanor falling

Third Verse [Prime Time]:

I'm up early in the morn,
They bouncin' it down,
Please don't give me none of that crack, won't you just give me heroin?
They said that heroin is bad,
I can my mind, want a Peter bag,
It's a Big Boy thang, so slow me down I'm too fast,
I brought along with me boys, a cubic square Therien Black,
I say some Melphanine boys that's not scared to use the gat,
Five oh's on our dick, tryin' to catch Partners N Crime falling,
But too late man, we're Up Early N Tha Morning,
Up Early N Tha Morning, I jump sheib,
You want to kick it for ya and his name is Prime Time,
I said I'm sloooowed, and I like to shine,
Me go by the name, of little Prime Time

Chorus:
I'm up Early N Tha Morning,
Hoes can never catch lil' Prime Time falling,
Up Early N Tha Morning,
Hoes can never catch lil' Prime Time falling

Fourth Verse [Kangol Slim]:

I'm Up Early N Tha Morning, wash up my face, brush up my teeth,
Gotta go on the set, I got some ends to meet,
Stepped out my house stopped short, oh no!
I went back in, I forgot my Kangol,
Then I dashed out the house, not looking shabby or clean
Went on the fucking corner, to serve all the rock fiends,
Five-oh comes to try and catch a nigga falling,
But too late man, we're Up Early N Tha Morning,
Up Early N Tha Morning, I jump sheib,
Me kick the funky reggae but me don't know why,
Because I'm slooooowed, and all these hoes know,
I go by the name of little Kangol

Chorus:
I'm up Early N Tha Morning,
Hoes can never catch lil' Kangol falling,
Up Early N Tha Morning,
Hoes can never catch lil' Kangol falling</pre>
