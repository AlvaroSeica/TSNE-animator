[Intro]
Smoke, Ty Beats
Better do it 'til we get right, uhh
This is for my niggaz gettin high on the regular
This is for my bitches gettin high on the regular

[ASAP Rocky]
Purple drink, I still sip
Purple weed, blunt still lit
Real nigga, real bitch
Ourple swag, that trill shit
Them candy cars, I'm comin down
That paint drip, I still tip
That pimp shit, she don't plan to fuck
I pick her up, I still hit
That's swag, bitch

[Chorus]
Everything is purple (swag)
Everything is purple... (swag, swag, swag) "I said"
Everything is purple (swag)
Everything is purple... (swag, swag, swag)

[Verse 2]
Purple swag, purple swag
I'm in the zone, I'm getting throwed
That purple swag, purple swag
That purple smoke, up in my clothes
That big booty, juicy fruity
Yellow bone, I wanna bone
I'm gettin dome, I took her out
Dick in her mouth, she gettin on
I'm flexin steel, I'm flexin still
I'm sittin high, I'm tippin slow
I'm Texas trill, Texas trill
But in NY we spit it slow
(I got these boppers goin crazy)
(They see me comin)
(Robitussin, quit discussin)
(ASAP, tell these niggaz somethin)

[Chorus]</pre>
