Ha Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
We in the B room...I wish I had the A room...
KMD H2o and this is how we go
("I don't really know but somebody said some musical rhythms can fuck wit ya head")

[H2O]
Original recipe but not from Kentuky
Bunch of nilla ass niggaz throwing bolos like Rocky
Pass the ism and watch a nigga get risen
Witcha pen to the pad I fuck ya head up with this rythm, um
With the fat shit that make your fuckin hat flip
(Back)I can do the boogaloo black and then the full split
Swingin the f with H20 and K.M.D.
Comin crazy mad looped for the ninteen nine three
So tap the bottom of my forty and then pass it
I'd like to take this time to say peace to the masses
We kicks the shit to put the rump in your trunk cause
We got the funk we got it
We got the funk and don't forget it
Taste the terror in ya area so check it
Gets more wreck than Larry Davis undetected
So pass the philly so a nigga can get red
By the way some shit can fuck wit ya head

("Some musical rhythms can")

(Back up! Back up!)

[Zev Love X]
Step back you dilly stunts
I'm illy more than once a day
I'm rollin phily blunts till I'm really a silly dunce
So don't fuck around
The X ain't glued tight
Oh yeah I'll tell ya somethin, your drums aint cued right
I write with the crude light beam from a street lamp
It's under the cherry moon
To me that's a cheap tramp
The drips from the bottle gettin hit from the back, kid
The OE poster model gettin stuck like thumbtacks did sticker
I'm sicker than the black plauge I'm quicker
To fuck wit ya head like hard liquor, ooiiee
Cold spin the U-ey, teks out the hatchback
Gooey be the bastards, punch buggy black attack
I wish to be, rich like daddy
But when I bite into a york pepperment patty I'm batty
I'm needing new frontier to conquor cause in rap there's more toys than Tonka
Like a tumor or a rumor I'm finna spread
Somebody said, some musical rhythms can fuck wit ya head
I don't really know but...

Somebody said ? fuck wit ya head!
Check it out check it out check it out check it out
Fuck wit ya head!
Check it out, check it out, check it out, who's next nigga, time out

[CMOB]
DL DL! That's my name don't wear it out
And all do respect, but get my dick out your mouth
Your fiending your fiendin so I hit you with these dope
Rhymes that I eject with the levels of the smoke
The boom to the dome when a physical reacts
I'm stronger than co-cocaine I mean crack
Not condonin the usage of drugs, or drug abuse
The positive brothers with a charge, who needs a boost?
I pop mad shit cause there's enough to go around
I stay on the DOWN with a chick cross town
So all ya bitch take ya pills if ya know what's real
And if ya know what's real, all ya bitch take ya pills
I kick the fat shit, and make it hard to handle
If your bitin' on my dick, it makes you a cannibal
Never simplistic, always realistic
No you can't hit this so don't try the fit this (Check it)
Let me bust off and dust it down with cement
Nigga from the 12 fuckin wit ya head

I'll Check it out check it out check it out check it out, check it out, fuck wit ya head!
I'll Check it out, check it out, check it out, check it out, check it out yo, fuck wit ya head!
I'll check it out! Check it out, check it out, check it out, check it out yo, fuck wit ya head!
I'll check it out, check it out, fuck wit ya head!

[Subroc]
Mr. Roc the cock blocker, bullet blocker
With the tears I give ya fears I'm the eardrum knocka
Villian, I knocked 'em out to the head
I used the 'chete so he didn't pull the bullet instead
He knew I was the man standin there
He ran with fear, and I troubled there
I take ya girl NIGGA
Ya jealous NIGGA
I got the fellas and we're all runnin triggas
Me and my black rugged time machine
I bury kids, teleport to dream
Have a seat yeah, sit right there
In the electric chair, so I'll cut off ya hair
Be out, no you can't get no cash back
Ya get the back smack, yes my boys crack on ya ass
Let me just slow down time
And make some musical rhythms that fuck wit ya mind

Check it out check it out
Fuck wit ya head!
..Fuck wit ya head!
Check it out! Fuck wit ya head!
