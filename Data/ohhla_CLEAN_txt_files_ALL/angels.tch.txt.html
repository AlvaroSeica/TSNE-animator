[dialogue from "In the Line of Fire"]
What do you see when you're in the dark, and the Demons come?
  I see you
  I see you standing over the grave of another dead President

[Chorus: Bazaar Royale]
I see angels above me, demons below me
Fighting over heaven, heaven, heaven is real

[stic.man - Dead Prez]
America's nightmare; young black and just don't give a fuck
Run up in a court room and wet 'em up
Got nuttin to lose, but my handcuffs
Every man must choose to lay down or stand up
It's war time, everything is fair no fear
When they said the homey murdered the judge, I don't care
Fuck him, he deserved it!
Long as the homie get away and don't get caught for the crime, I encourage it
We rootin for the villain in black
Pourin out our salutes, salute, niggaz is shootin back
In self defence we bang the pistols like
Larry Davis or Brian Nickles
Every pig, every public official
The boomerang is comin back to get you
You reap what you sewed didn't you?
The system you created created a monster
And now you scared cause it's comin back to haunt ya

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

[M1 - Dead Prez]
Since we gonna take the blame, I'ma rep my name to get my aim right
Lets have a overthrow and after-party in the same night
Same height as Huey, same muscle build as Malcolm
with the same circumstances in the hood you know the outcome
And read it in the news about your sergeant and your captain
Don't take this as a warning just another nigga rappin
Fuck the way we organizin fuck the trainin and the grapplin
And fuck them Uncle Toms who call police because we smacked 'em
And fuck you sympathizers with your middle class reactions
Cus we bangin on the system G'ed up, fuck the factions
And if you didn't know the G was for George Jackson
And long live his warrior spirit packin a Magnum
Watching over the soldiers knowin niggaz be blackin
when we really need to be disciplined in our ways and actions
When we get some freedom you niggaz can start braggin
Until then, inside the blood in my eye, you see the dragon

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

[Immortal Technqiue]
Yeah~! Uhh
I'm like the birth of baby Mohammed
The movement I started could spar with the hardest
a martyr regarded as spartic dishearted
It doesn't matter whose missiles can shoot the farthest
when you're a target in an Afghan Teutoburg forest
Close quarters combat, over corrupted elections
Bilderberg is like cancer, it grows with infection
Nepotism is the gold in the conductors connection
And ignorance is the prison that the people are kept in
The military ain't there for the peoples protection
they're just there to protect an investment
That's why people get arrested, electrocuted, molested
Connected streets are infested, with those tired of protesting
Traumatized children grown in guerilla garrisons
9/11 generations pale in comparison
And you will learn a lesson repeated through history
that no matter what you think, occupation is not victory~!

[Chorus] - repeat 4X

[Immmortal over Chorus]
Somalia, Kashmir, Nigeria, Palestine
Iraq, bring it back</pre>
