Monday's here, up at six thirty
Wednesday, I just gotta keep workin
Friday night, let's get down and dirty
Sunday, I better go to bed early
Monday's here

[Dizzy Dustin]
I need some cash
Late to the job so Im driving fast
Had a close call and I nearly crashed
I ran out of gas, I need some cash

[Andy Cooper]
Man, it's still storming
Three days straight and won't stop pouring
Leak in my roof so I gotta to call the foreman
Wait, it's clearing up, been sunny all morning
Man, it's too hot

[Dizzy Dustin]
Let's go to a show
My favorite emcee with the classic flow
In line to buy tickets down in the front row
Sold out ten seconds ago
Let's go to a shot

[Andy Cooper] + (Dizzy Dustin)
Let's go to a show, I'll call some friends
(We can go to Vegas where the party never ends)
Got my paycheck and Im ready to spend
(Have to tell the wife Im broke again)

[Chorus: Andy Cooper + Dizzy Dustin] (Andy Cooper)
It's coming, it's coming, it's coming
It's here, it's gone
It's coming! (Anticipate)
It's coming! (She's about to break)
It's coming! (I just can't wait)
It's here, it's gone

[Dizzy Dustin]
The group's doing well selling lots of LPs
Touring in the states and overseas
They put the new video on TV (What!)
Record sales drop cause of MP3s

[Andy Cooper]
Met a young lady, smiled hello
Got the digits, mobile and home
She looks much better than the girls I've known
I wait a few days then I dial the phone
(Wrong number!) 

[Dizzy Dustin]
I bought a new album today
I can't wait to get it in my CD tray (What?)
Open up the case Im about to press play
...throw it away

[Andy Cooper]
Man, I need clothes, my closet's tapped
Hit the outlet store and search the racks
Found new pants and a shirt to match
Brought the stuff home, my sneakers clash
Man, I need clothes 

[Dizzy Dustin]
They hatched the deal

[Andy Cooper]
Yep, publishing advance worth half a mill

[Dizzy Dustin]
He bought the crew cars and platinum grills

[Andy Cooper]
Bounced check and a stack of bills

[Chorus: Andy Cooper + Dizzy Dustin] (Andy Cooper)
It's coming, it's coming, it's coming
It's here, it's gone
It's coming! (Anticipate)
It's coming! (She's about to break)
It's coming! (I just can't wait)
It's here, it's gone</pre>
