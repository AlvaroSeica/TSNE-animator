[Verse 1 - J. Cole]
Baby girl, I can't imagine what it's like for you
I got you pregnant, now inside there is a life in you
I know you wonderin if this is gon' make me think 'bout wifin you
Like if you had my first child, would I spend my whole life with you?
Nah, I ain't tryin to pick a fight with you, I'm tryin to talk
Nah, I ain't tryin to spend the night with you, I'm kinda lost
See, I've been givin it some thought lately and
Frankly I'm feelin like we ain't ready and this
Hold up now, let me finish
Think about it baby, me and you we still kids ourself
How we gonna raise a kid by ourself?
Handle biz by ourself? A nigga barely over twenty
Where the hell we gon' live? Where am I gon' get that money?
I refuse to bring my boy or my girl in this world, when I ain't got 
shit to give 'em
And I'm not with them niggaz who be knockin girls up and skate out
So girl you gotta think about how the options weigh out
What's the way out? Uh

[Chorus 1 - J. Cole] - 2X - w/ ad libs
And I ain't too proud to tell ya that I cry sometime
I cry sometimes about it
And girl I know it hurt but if this world was perfect
Then we can make it work but I doubt it

[Verse 2 - J. Cole]
Uh, she said "nigga, you got some nerve, to come up to me talkin about abortion
This my body nigga, so don't think you fittin to force shit
See I knew that this is how you act, so typical
Said you love me, oh but now you flippin like reciprocals
It figures though, I should of known that you was just another nigga
No different from them other niggaz
Who be claimin that they love you just to get up in them drawers
Knowin all the right things to say, I let you hit it raw, motherfucker
Now I'm pregnant, you don't wanna get involved, motherfucker?
Tryin to take away a life, is you God, motherfucker?
I don't think so (uh), this a new life up in my stomach
Regardless if I'm your wife, this new life here I'm a love it
I ain't budgin, I'll just do this by my motherfuckin self
See my mama raised me without no motherfuckin help
from a man, but I still don't understand how you could say that
Did you forget all those conversations that we had way back
'Bout your father? And you told me that you hate that nigga
Talkin about he a coward and you so glad that you ain't that nigga
'Cause he left your mama when she had you and he ain't shit
And here you go doin the same shit, you ain't shit nigga"

[Chorus 2 - J. Cole] - w/ ad libs
And I ain't too proud to tell ya that I cry sometimes
I cry sometimes about it
And boy that shit hurt and ain't nobody perfect
Still we can make it work but you doubt it

Nah, I ain't too proud to tell ya that I cry sometimes
I cry sometimes about it
And boy that shit hurt and ain't nobody perfect
Still we can make it work but you doubt it

[Verse 3 - J. Cole]
They say everything happens for a reason and people change like the seasons
then grow apart, she wanted him to show his heart and say he loved her (yeah)
He spoke the magic words and on the same day he fucked her
Now she wide open (uh huh), she'd put a ring up on his finger if she could (yep)
But he loved her 'cause the pussy good (uh)
But she ain't no wife though (nope)
Uh oh, she tellin him she missed her period like typos
He panickin, froze up like a mannequin, a life grows
inside her, now he askin "is it even mine?" (damn)
What if this bitch ain't even pregnant dog, could she be lyin?
And she be cryin 'cause he actin distant
Like "ever since I told you this, nigga you actin different"
And all his niggaz sayin "man, these hoes be trappin niggaz
Playin with niggaz' emotions like they some action figures
Swear they get pregnant for collateral, it's like extortion
Man if that bitch really pregnant tell her get an abortion"
Uh, but what about your seed nigga?

[Outro - J. Cole] - 3X
And I ain't too proud to tell ya that I cry sometime
I cry sometimes about it

[J. Cole - talking over Outro]
Uh, uh, yeah, what about your seed nigga?
Uh, what about your seed nigga?
What about your seed nigga? Yeah</pre>
