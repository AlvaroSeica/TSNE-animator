Semi semi automatic in my Fendi Fendi bag 
for any any hoes feelin envy envy if you choose to 
but I got some killers that'll bury and use you

[Black Child]
Nigga we do this for the doe doe, hurtin hurtin

When the pound kick, round spit hit the ground quick
Playa playa I hate a hater whose flow flow is so-so
Midget niggaz who grow slow
Fire fire when I spit, full clip

Chorus 2X

[Busta Rhymes]
Murda murda, yo, yo-yo yo

I'll make y'all niggaz leak from my lyrical lecture
and treasure the moment feel pleasure from when I wet ya (WHAT!)
Split ya cardiovascular up from the bullets we sent ya 
Listen we dishin our flava we cookin da kitchen (what!)
Like we cookin and breakin our la-ast pot we got to piss in
I'm bout to cop an ounce of weed (how many wanna chip in?!)
And get a bunch of wild murderin niggaz 
time is all we need to be flippin

[Ja Rule]
Neva eva before fore
Whatever reason you think you law 
Lord tell em I'ma nigga that clip it cock it and dead em
I'ma behead em for no flow, wet em if they dry slow
Funny style niggaz I'll lift like lo-lo's
Then pimp yo broke hoes (whoa!)

Why why the fuck not I'm a Murderer murderin any 
and everything that's in my way -- holla holla</pre>
