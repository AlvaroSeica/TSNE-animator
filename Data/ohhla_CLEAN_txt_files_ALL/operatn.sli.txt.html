Operation send the rescue team
Operation shoot 'em on the street
Operation comin after me
Oh operation say what we will say
(lets go!)
If breakin' rules is what we do its a shame to go to waste
The potency of jah tea it leaves a bitter taste
Head downtown to a bank to pull another job
I say that we were suspects caught by officer bob
See a bunch of cops standin' over there
Sayin' wave those fuckin' pistols in the motherfuckin' air
Said operation send the rescue team
Operation shoot 'em on the street
Operation comin' after me oh
Operation say what we will say
(yeah!)
It doesn't take a genius
To see what we've begun
If we go down to jail said we're sure to be hung
I pull my colt 45
And aim it at his head
I said he turned around and closed his eyes and this is what he said
See a bunch of cops
Standin' over there
Sayin' wave those fuckin' pistols in the motherfuckin' air
Said operation send the rescue team
Operation shoot 'em on the street
Operation comin' after me
Oh operation say what we will say
(eat it)
See a bunch of cops
Standin' over there
Sayin' wave those fuckin' pistols in the motherfuckin' air
Sayin
Operation send the rescue team
Operation shoot 'em on the street
Operation comin' after me
Oh operation say what we will say
Oh yeah</pre>
