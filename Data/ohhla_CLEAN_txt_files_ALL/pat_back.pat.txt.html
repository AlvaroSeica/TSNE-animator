Let the bass come in 
Then I'm a start 
Comin hard 
Enough to bust 
Im outa the flow so hard 
And you know I'm one of the hard 
Its gangsta art 
Its been a record 
And put suckas in check fast 
As I blast 
With a mask 
You know and I know that I be the last one 
Standin I in demandin 
Im ready to bust my flow and 
Im knowin 
Im blowin up 
These woman are steadily goin 
Im rippin and flippin the track 
Back on attack 
Im like the mat 
Checkin these suckas for money 
And really you're funny 
Cause you know that I got a stack 
Cheese if you please 
Let me do my thang 
As I hang 
Up off in the hood 
It's all good 
Cause you know I gotta slang in the game 
Cause I'm the loud type 
Gotta get the crowd hype 
Im back on attack 
So make quick fools 
You know who it is man 
Im back 

4X 
Pat is back, Pat is back 

Im droppin them deadly verses 
With no rehearses, huh 
These bustas I wish my curses 
I put em' hearses, huh 
Im droppin this bass in your face man 
I know you can feel me, huh 
I don't care if people don't like me 
Just give me my prop G 
And let me just stack up my cheese man 
I gatta get paid black, huh 
I gatta stack me a million 
So I can be laid back 
Beamers all ? 
They don't give me love G 
But it don't really matter 
Im hooked on my music 
So I'm a stay up G 
Oh I'm so amazin 
Im ready to bust man 
Im kicken up dust man, huh 
The people that mack think they're tough man 
You can't get with us man, huh 
We rollin so clean and so tight black 
Im a hit you right back 
Im a livin so phat 
But before I go 
Im a let you know 
Im back 

4X 
Pat is back, Pat is back 

(doesn't take a breath) 

Im rippin an flippin that shotgun 
Im back on attackin 
Im ready to bust 
And I'm kicken up dust 
And I'm know when flowin 
Im goin 
Im up 
And I'm ready to cross 
And they bust 
So they wanna run up 
And get stuck 
Im so buckin 
Im as tight as I wanna be 
Straight out of tennis G 
Chillin with homies 
And rollies up out of the hood 
It's all good 
Cause you know that I'm goin to be 
Bustin and rushin them pages 
With stashes of lyrics 
That can not be faded 
Im takin this flow 
And I'm goin on up to the top 
I can't stop 
Until I know that I made it 
I played it so smart from the start 
And I'm back on attackin 
When a rake 
And put suckas 
The chickens go off 
Are the ones that get dealers 
Cause I'm nation wide 
And I'm steadily chashin them checks at the bank 
While you bustas get gat for your cheese 
And I'm comin up strong 
In the business 
So whiteness the flow that 
I kick it so big 
That you gatta step back off a pad 
And let me bust 
The first at a show 
And get paid 
Never yank when my bank 
Cause I'm bustin so tight 
And I offend with attack 
With this bass in your trunk 
And drop funk in your system 
Cause I know you miss me 
But now I come back 

15X 
Pat is back, Pat is back </pre>
