Whooohoo, feel real good right here
This is ya boy Jimi Kendrix, I.N.C
Family business, (I.G. What up!)
Ashanti, What up baby! (Ja)
You ready to go? (Lloyd)
Lets go in this club and tear it up
Oh! Now I need everybody to get off your feet
Put Your drinks down
Get off the wall and stop tryna be so cute
Ya heard me?
Come on! Here... We... Go.. Come on!

[Chorus: Ashanti]  (Jimi Kendrix)
We're gonna party through the night (Turn It Up)
Don't you wanna drink and dance tonight? (Oh)
Don't try to be so cute tonight (Gotta loosen Up)
Let the beat drop and make you feel, ohhhhh so free

[Ashanti] (Jimi Kendrix)
I got to find out that nothing make me feel good tonight (Oh)
Oh so good tonight (Oh, oh, oh)
Got my girls with me (Oh, oh)
We gon' tear down this thing tonight, down this thing tonight (Oh, oh, oh)
All my ladies lookin' hot to death and sweatin' them things right to meltin'
Everybody in the place just got that look up on they face like
Oh what a beautiful body, let sweat drip off my body
So here's what I do (Turn it up)

[Chorus]

[Ashanti] (Jimi Kendrix)
I just feel like I, like I could float up to the sky (Oh)
And come back feelin' right (Oh, oh, oh)
This is somethin' I usually do but I just might (Oh)
Get with you tonight (Oh, oh, oh)
All my ladies lookin' hot to death and sweatin' them things right to meltin'
Everybody in the place just got that look up on they face like
Oh what a beautiful body, let sweat drip off my body
So here's what I do (Turn it Up)

[Chorus]

[Ja Rule] (Jimi Kendrix) {Ashanti}
Rule, Niggaz loosen up!
And button down your button up
See the joint in the club, lets tear the club up (Oh)
It gets just that hot in here
Cool me down prayin' O.J. and Belvedere
Over the rocks while the crowd is rockin'
Everybody's rollin' like we live in woodstock (Oh, oh)
Let's all toast to the highest and utmost the Rule and the {Princess}
And everbody with the two step {Get up, dance}
And all my gangstas that don't dance, {Lean back}
'Cause this is gangstafied, so its justified
We all wanna party with Rule tonight
Any ladies that can fute the night, send 'em my way
I'll show 'em how to loosen up, get in a cardale
Move, baby the name is Rule
R-U-L-E reppin' I-N-C (OH)

(Chorus)

(Outro: Ashanti)
Yea
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby</pre>
