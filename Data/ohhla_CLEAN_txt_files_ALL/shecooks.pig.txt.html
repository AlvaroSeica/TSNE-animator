[Pigeon John]
wake up the morning the bright sun shines and
brushin my teeth when I smell eggs and bacon
walk down the stairs to see you cookin
when in my shirt your so good lookin
sit on the couch you givin me coffee
sugar and cream it makes me a softy
what did I do to deserve such an angel
the nod in my heart untameble

[Pigeon John - chorus]
you cook me oatmeal
you make me breakfast
and I miss you
oh where you at baby
Cause I'm hungry
oh where you at baby
you cook me oatmeal
oh make me some baby
you make me breakfast
I need something
and I miss you
oh where you at baby
Cause I'm hungry
oh where you at baby

[Pigeon John]
we goin to North Richmond to run airments
and all these high school boys they just starin
Cause it strolled 'em with the flawless diamond
and I'm with cause it's a myrical finding
BCBG you tryin some clothes on
I'm sittin on greedy and waitin till you all done
my boys say I'm goin all in that I'm brainless
but that's when you walk out in that black dress

[Pigeon John - chorus]
and you cook me oatmeal
you make me breakfast
and I miss you
oh where you at baby
Cause I'm hungry
oh where you at baby
you cook me oatmeal
oh oh make me some baby
you make me breakfast
oh oh I need some
and I miss you
oh where you at baby
Cause I'm hungry
oh where you at baby</pre>
