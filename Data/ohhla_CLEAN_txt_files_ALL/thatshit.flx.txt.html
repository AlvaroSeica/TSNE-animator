Verse 1: JD

And this goes out to everybody who doubts, runnin' ya mouth,
And don't know what you talkin' 'bout,
You ain't familiar wit' the D, don't go that route,
Just keep ya hand on ya toolie if ya walkin' 'bout,
It's all live now,
And for the greatest amount,
But make the ladies say ho, 
and the ho's say oww, 
and the owls say whoot da whoot,
Turnin' it out,
It's SV still on a quest baby knockin' you out,
It's like dat,

Verse 2: Q-Tip

Word up, 
It's The Love Movement, it's all love
cause we make ma-fuckas be fond of us,(us us)
We like the ladies, intelligent ones
but when the lights go out it's time to fondle us, (us us)
It's apprehension, when playin' ya joint
cause JD makes it sound so marvelous, (us us)
If you beefin', then settle ya soul
while we make all of y'all just bond wit' us
Got your work on you, you better put it away
police be lookin' for the vandlous, (us us)
JD from the DSV family
Phife these jokers can't handle us, (us us)
