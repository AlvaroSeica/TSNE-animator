[Fabolous]
Guess who?
J to the Lo
F to the A-B
Ho, Yeah
Ho, Yeah
I ain't mister right, I'm mister right now (Ho!)
I keep women in thongs, comin' along (Ho!)
With visibly set stones, some of them prong (Woo!)
I can tell you ain't never had someone this long
One night, have 'em hummin' my song
Like 'Mmmm-hmmm, Mmmm-hmmm'
Girl, you ain't know I was comin this strong
Now you know not to come at me wrong
Now get right, uh

[Jennifer Lopez]
You're lookin just a little too hard at me
Standin just a little too close to me
You're sayin not quite enough to me
You're sippin just a little too slow for me
No doubt you play it real cool, Homie
Got me thinkin 'what is it you do for me?'
Trippin (trippin) a little more than I should be
So let yourself go and get right with me!

(Chorus)
I'm about to sign you up, we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get
(Riii-oooooh-iiiiight) Get right, we can get right
(Riii-oooooh-iiiiight) Get right, we could get right
I'm about to fill your cup so we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get
(Riii-oooooh-iiiiight) Get right, tonight
(Riii-oooooh-iiiiight) Get right, we can get right

Here I come
Here I come
Here I come
Here I come

Your lips talkin' bout I play too much
Can't a woman take advantage of what she wants?
My hips movin' oh so slow
Bar tab lookin' like a car loan (car loan)
All I need is you here right by my side
Take whatever you want, Baby let's ride
And whatever you won't do, let me decide
Just put your name on the dotted line!

(Chorus)

So much that we've got to say but so little time
And if tonight ain't long enough don't leave love behind
(Don't leave this love behind)
Baby take my hand, I'll show you why

(Chorus)

[Fabolous]
Ho, Ho, Ho, Ho, Ho, Ho
It's slim with the tilted brim on 20 inch rims
Rocked up wrist watch, six inch timbs
Button up shirt, cuff with the french trim
So you can tell the man "Get to the right!" (ho!)
I'm in the driver's seat, you sit to the right (ho!)
And this is just to get to the flight (ho!)
I like the way it fit to you tight
So I'mma show you the world in a day
Before it even get to the night (Woo)
I'm lookin for a dime
But I don't need a penny, though
Or any ol' wanna be Jenny Lo, No!
Plenty dough
And there's plenty mo, Where it come from
I'm the real talk where I come from, Ho!

[Jennifer Lopez]
(Chorus x2... fades into young girl singing along)</pre>
