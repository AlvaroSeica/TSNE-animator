[Chorus: repeat]
She's all that I want

[ASAP Rocky]
She's all that I need, I'm filling your cup up
With Sprite and codeine, she get me so high
But I'm down on my knees, was it your desire?
Your life or that lean? Wait a minute
Cause ain't shit changed, just a different day
This the kinda pain I just couldn't take away
Something like Wayne cause you couldn't feel your face
Is you in it for the feeling or the taste? Wait a minute
What's the motherfuckin problem? Me and my niggaz mob
Throwin up gang signs, fuck a +Goon+ and a +Goblin+
Gold grill shinin, don't ask me how I got 'em
Styrofoam cups with jolly ranchers at the bottom

[Chorus]

[ASAP Ferg]
Heyyyy and now I'm blowin hella smoke
Talking on my cell-a-phone and I got that purple on me
She sippin on my styrofoam cup
Tellin me she wanna bone but I ain't got no condoms on me
She claimin I'm a +Pimp C+
Cause I'm sippin +Big Moe+ when I'm on that +Screw+ juice
She sip it 'til it's empty
Purple on the mustache, now it's time to screw you
And I wanna chop and screw you girl
Moving like it's turtle time, feelin like the world is mine mine
I be on my Fergenstein
I stay on my money grind, and I'm goin out of my mind
Flying through the purple sky
And I'm in a different world and you kinda look like Jasmine Guy
And I'm kissin on that pink juice
Sippin on that pimp juice

[Chorus]</pre>
