[J.D.]
This here 
Is a remarkable So So Def
Remix
J.E. y'all
Run-DMC to the beat y'all
Ah-ha ahhh-ha
And me?
Yea I know my name

[Jagged Edge]
See, first of all 
I know these so-called players wouldn't tell you this 
But I'ma be real and say what's on my heart
Let's take this chance and make this love feel relevant
Didn't you know I loved you from the start, yeah

When I think about 
All these years we've put in this relationship
Who knew we'd make it this far?
Then I think about 
Where would I be if we were to just to fall apart
And I can't stand the thought of losing you

[Chorus]
Meet me at the altar in your white dress
We ain't getting no younger we might as well do it
Been feeling you all the while girl I must confess
Girl, let's just get married I just wanna get married.

Meet me at the altar in your white dress
We ain't getting no younger We might as well do it
Been feeling you all the while girl I must confess
Let's get married (baby let's get married)

[Jagged Edge]
Said, I done it all
But frankly girl, I'm tired of this emptiness
I wanna come home to you and only you
Cause, making love to just anyone ain't happening
I just gotta be with you

Do you think about
Us finishing something We started so long ago
I wanna give you my all
Do you think about 
Maybe us having some babies?
Come on won't you be my lady
Forever, yeah

[Run]
What's going on across the sea?
It ain't nothin' I ain't frontin' 
Shorty coming with me
Now I done already gave you the keys to the Range 
And your last name 'bout to change
Now your Mrs. Simmons
Got a better livin' 
What the difference
Grab my name
I used to be the snake type
Hangin out late night
Girl you done made me change my life
Every since you met me
Keys to the Bentley 
Now they call you the preachers wife
I'm the type of guy that
Take you out and buy that 
Ring with the rock that will break your arm
Players won't try that
Now you can't deny that

(Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh)

[Chorus] - repeat 4X</pre>
