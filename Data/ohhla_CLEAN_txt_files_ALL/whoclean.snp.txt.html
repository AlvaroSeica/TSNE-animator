(Verse 1)
[Snoop Dogg] From the depths of the sea, back to the block
             Snoop Doggy Dogg, funky as the, the
             The D.O.C.
             Went solo on that ass, but it's still the same
             Long Beach is the spot where I served my cane
             Follow me
             Follow me, follow me, follow me, but you bet not slip
             Cause nine-trizzay's the yizzear for me to fizzup my grip
             So I ain't holdin' nothin' back
             And once again, I got five on the twenty sack
             It's like that and as a matter of fact
[Dr. Dre]    Rat-tat-tat-tat
[Snoop Dogg] Cause I never hesitate to put a fool on his back
[Dr. Dre]    Yeah
             So peep out the manuscript
             You see that it's a must we drop gangsta sshhh
[Snoop Dogg] Hold up
             What's my name?

Repeat Hook

[Jewell (Tony Green)]
Da-da-da-da, da-dah
Do, do, do, do
De, de
Da-dah (DOGG)

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg (Jewell &amp; Tony Green) {Tony Green}]
It's the bow to the wow, creepin' and crawlin'
Yiggy, yes y'all'in, Snoop Doggy Dogg in 
The house, with the Pound, like everyday
And I'm right back up in ya with Dr. Dre
And like I said
None of y'all can't GET with this
And none of y'all can't GET with that 
Hit I just drop, cause you know it don't stop
Mr. 187 on a undercover cop
Tick, tock
Never the glock
Just some nuts and a cock
Rob you for your ears, then I kill you blood clots
And I step through the fog, and I creep through the smog
Cause I'm Snoop Doggy (Who?)
Doggy (What?)
Doggy {DOGG}

Repeat Hook

[Tony Green]
Bow-wow-wow, yippy-yo, yippy-yay
Bow-wow-wow, yippy-yo (The bomb)
Bow-wow-wow, yippy-yo, yippy-yay
Bow-wow-wow, yippy-yo-yo-yo-yo-yo-yo-yo-yo (DOGG)

(Verse 3)
{Tony Green in background}
[Snoop Dogg] Now just
             Throw your hands way up in the air
             And wave them all around like you just don't care {DOGG}
             Yeah, roll up the dank, and pour the drank
             And watch your step (Why?)
             Cause Doggy's on the gank
             My bank roll's on swoll
             I'm still on hit, legit, now I'm on parole, stroll
             With Tha Dogg Pound, right behind me
             And rollin' with my bitch, that's where you might find me
             Layin' that, playin' that G Thang
             She want the G with the biggest sack
             And who's that?
             He is I, and I am him
             Slim with the tilted brim
[Kurupt]     What's your name, fool?
