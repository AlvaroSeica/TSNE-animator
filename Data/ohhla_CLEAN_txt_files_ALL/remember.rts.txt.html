[Black Thought]
I drew a two of hearts from a deck of cards
A stock trick from my empty repertoire
Another hopeless story never read at all
I'm better off lookin for the end, where the credits are
It's a pain living life against the grain
I'm lookin back and y'all look the same
Troy, Mark, and lil' what's-his-name, memory is rerunnin it all
It's the flight of my fall, and it's right on the wall
 
[Chorus: Jazzyfatnastees]
I remember, can you remember
how it was? I do
remember, do you? 
I remember, can you remember
how it was? I do
remember, do you? 
 
[Black Thought]
I used to ride the train to the same two stops
and look at the graffiti on the rooftops
Like the same song playin on the jukebox
Joint called "Faded Polaroids in a Shoebox"
Regardless to what the cadence is
It can't be forgotten like old acquaintances
I realize how depressin of a place it is
and when I notice my reflection, whose face it is
 
[Chorus]
 
{musical break}
 
[Chorus]
 
[Black Thought]
It's only human to express the way you really feel
But that same humanity is my Achilles' heel
A leopard can't change his spots and never will
So I'm forever ill, now I can never chill
What's keepin me from breakin out like Benadryl
when my baptism of fire resulted in a kill?
Sometimes it's as cut and dry as a business deal
You gotta cause the blood of a close friend to spill
But you remember still...</pre>
