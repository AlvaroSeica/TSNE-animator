[Intro]
I'm a star, I'm a star..
Uh, I'm a star, I'm a star baby
Stick with me I'll take you to the top

[L.E.G.A.C.Y]
I'm a star, glistenin in your constellation
On the raw, spittin for the domination
I'm a star like a view from your terrace
I'm a star, head-to-head with Polaris
I'm furious, when I end it dude
I'm serious, and if I offended you, I'm sorry
Smoke to it like it's Bob Marley
with or without the Wailers, with or without the haters
Hi baby! Love it when it drops baby
Drop flamin heat hooks, got game like T-Wolf
But go-to man, I go thru plans
The human puzzle, two animals, a Wuzzle
Somethin up, strangle foes, heaven fuck angel holes
Billy Bad Ass plus, still he smash rap, what!
Pack it up, I make it pop here
That's enough, I'ma stop it

[Chorus: Joe Scudda]
Bitch, I'm a star! Do you, do me
Do it like we do for on TV, in case you haven't heard
Bitch, I'm a star! Do you, do me
Do it like we do for on TV, in case you haven't heard
Bitch, I'm a star! Do you, do me
Do it like we do for on TV, in case you haven't heard
Bitch, I'm a star! Do you, do me
Do it like we do for on TV, in case you haven't heard

[Chaundon]
Yo, I've been a star for a long time, hustle was a slow grind
Been known to hold mine, mad hard to chart climb
Rockin when it's showtime, crowd knows the whole rhyme
Hooks, ad-libs, intros, you know the whole nine
No promotion, marketing or distribution
Radio or even DJ Clue? exclusives
Strictly the word of mouth was how the kid was heard about
Hoods of New York to the streets of the Dirty South
Roll with a better team, spit with a clever scheme
My reality stones your glasshouse, it shatters dreams
No one as bad as me, you ain't even gotta emcee
No originality, your style is just a parody
Check it, I'm the best out, who can tell me opposite?
I question your ability to grab the mic and rock this
Chaundon the Backtwist, servin who you bring to me
Place me in the industry, this kid is makin history

[Chorus]

[Median]
I'm a star, we all are, we shine 'til we large
Rock crowds of thou's, we crowned with applause
Spar with reality, we clowned with the law
Pause, we stop traffic, we all bastards
Fathered by this rap shit, we all fashioned
Shined when the crowd, make planets take orbit
Shoulda scored tonight with the dogs I walked with
Light blue Air Force Ones, swap my strings
Two-tone balance, Median, we group home whylin 
Five deep, V-S to the O-P-P
on some Treach shit, on some Next shit
Pass all-access, my platinum necklace
(Platinum in my necklace)

[Joe Scudda]
That's what I'm talkin 'bout
My man Median, he's a star
He don't even gotta finish his last four bars
And you wan' do shit? Fuck you!

[Chorus]

[Outro]
In case you haven't heard</pre>
