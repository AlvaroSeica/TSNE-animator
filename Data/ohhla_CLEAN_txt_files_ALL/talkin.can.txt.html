You don't have a broad enough bandwith to understand Bis 
Like what if - I changed my name to CAN-I-RIP 
Tell me, would you understand it? 
Or does it trouble you? 
Is it too much over your head, does it puzzle you? 
I can rap about whateva the fuck I want 
What's wrong with rappin about whateva the fuck I'd done 
Visually and verbally,  I'm hi-res cutting edge 
and if you know Rakim then you should "Know the Ledge" 
I know I do, Get everything I've ever rhymed to 
staple it together and you got a fuckin bible 
Let me remind you, Records like "Beasts from the East" 
proove that I crucify you 
if I ever get to rap behind you. 
What about the freestyles I put on vinyl 
for DJs and hiphop heads to get hype to 
Besides who raps like I do? 
If you ever heard I'm not the best you being lied to 
Here's a FYI to I can rip 
but you don't have the mental bandwith to understand Bis 
Niggaz wanna talk the talk, 
but when they get their feet chopped off  
they can't walk the walk </pre>
