Semtex said we good, then we good then
all D niggaz in d back where you hood at?
Tryna buy another sack, where d good at?
Shorty throw it back, and a nigga might luv that!
Yeah! Uh! Green and white flow!
MMG chain, looking like a light show
lot of weed on me, no tobacco
and they hating ass niggaz, we ain't like those
No, No, we are not those
haters and I drop top off in a hot cold
....but I got hoes, so fly, we are sayin', we are got those
we exclusive, they be talking but they never do shit
and I be telking about me, I do this
I got d whole darm world on this shoe shit, true shit
semetax said we're good, and we're good then
all the niggaz in the back, where your hood at?
I'm tryin' 2 buy another sack, where the good at
shorty throw it back and a nigga might luv that,
fuck that naija get the money
when I arrive the whole town gets sunny
they giving pound and that before get the money
they giving pounds and that's of course gettin' money
niggaz hate us, but we famous so I never blame 'em
I'm just sayin' they're mad cause I don't make much
spect of a 100 clear on these trainer they up
break it out, puck it out for a young G
young thing said never been 2 south beach
pack it up thirty minutes 2 d jet leaves
best we smoke, so much it's like jet lee work, work, work, work</pre>
