I'm on my way, on the highway
To a special place it never rains with better terrain
By the way I say goodbye gay
But ya cannot common somebody gots to stay
So I'mma see you in my life
I might get it right I might not sweat it not, I loved ya lots
So raise a glass to our friendship
We had a lot of laughs a lot of scraps you had by back though all of it
It's a tough pill to swallow kid
When you don't know if you'll see tomorrow did you see me on the TV yesterday?
Yesterday, before I had to leave my life and throw it all away
Throw my love in the bay
Yea I'll move from the gate
A sharp ache still when this think tank's ill
So keep buildin' for the children of the earth
After every death there comes a rebirth

When I leave this life a life leaves me, well still be friends yea will always be
Born an MC but I'll die a thief, take to my grace stolen memories
When I leave this life a life leaves me, well still be friends yea will always be
Born an MC but I'll die a thief, take to my grace stolen memories

I remember listening to Led Zeppelin
before I got into hip-hop or read anything
My old British pop, josh Lennon, ramblin'
like imagine, I never stop imagine hip-hop
'84 maybe more than was a fake
Breakdancin' everybody in my school did the wave
Remember sittin' in the shade, 4th grade
When you momma brought you cupcakes for your birthday
On the WWF, yes, on your bike
your were in trouble with double and was a vest
With a lady, well a girl I guess
I went to private school, I love that kilty dress
Powell and Peralta built the best
Def Jam was the label with the skill to test
Had a lady, gimme silky sex
How I love makin' love in the wilderness

When I leave this life a life leaves me, well still be friends yea will always be
Born an MC but I'll die a thief, take to my grace stolen memories
When I leave this life a life leaves me, well still be friends yea will always be
Born an MC but I'll die a thief, take to my grace stolen memories

Back in the day, I wish that I could stay
So many more things to say
But do I have to go away?
I remember when
Back in the day, I wish that I could stay
So many more things to say
So I have to go away yea

When the cool rain hit the hot pavement
All the fools yell "block party in the basement"
Poker face boys was a crew with the aces
Picture in my mind ain't forgettin' any faces
Basically it's a tragic comedy
I gotta go but I'll smilin' as I leave
On the eve of a new beginning
I know you be grinning' with women and a cinnamon bun just winnin'
When life gave us lemons, no lemonade, gin and tonic and a 7
A little piece of heaven in it
Gin a tonic so good with a little squeeze of lemon in it
Hot days and a summer breeze and a friends and family please remember me
Seeing the things I didn't deserve to see
Life's so good it's like a stolen memory

When I leave this life a life leaves me, well still be friends yea will always be
Born an MC but I'll die a thief, take to my grace stolen memories
When I leave this life a life leaves me, well still be friends yea will always be
Born an MC but I'll die a thief, take to my grace stolen memories

Back in the day, I wish that I could stay
So many more things to say
But do I have to go away?
I remember when
Back in the day, I wish that I could stay
So many more things to say
So I have to go away yea
