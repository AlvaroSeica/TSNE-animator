[Shawn Wigs]
Yo, ya'll wanna play games, but this ain't Mario Brothers
I just, run from them cops, NARCS, and undercovers
Get shift funny, when you haul ass with stolen money
In the bank, got your face in the news like youse a dummy
Half mills, unmarked bills, in two or three bags
And everyone wanna snitch cuz you ain't sharing the cash
Fuck that, ya'll ain't had the balls to back me
So I skate out of town, that's my plans exactly
But the feds know my name, three mill and a quarter
So I ziplocked my money and stash it under water
Skip town, shit, I got bagged at the bridge
But when I come home, got plenty of money to live
Muthafuckas...</pre>
