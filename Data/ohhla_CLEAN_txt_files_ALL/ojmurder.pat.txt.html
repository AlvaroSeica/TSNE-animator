Yeah, this psycho in the mother fuckin house 
Sittin here smokin on a phat ass blunt 
I know you remember me from the first album 
#1 suspect 
Yeah, my shit it be droppin soon on y'all mother fuckin ass 
But uh, we goin to take you on the subject of this O. J. case 
I know y'all thinkin y'all know who did this shit 
Well y'all got it all wrong 
Yo Gangsta pat 
Why don't ya let em' know what really happened 

I'm on my way out to California 
Brickwood is my destination 
I'm pickin up two kids 
Gatta make that cheese 
I ain't know hesitation 
Fresh off the highway 
Gotta get back up to the main intersection 
Busta ass nigga 
Fucked around and gave my wrong directions 
I'm lost like a motherfucker 
Better get some information quick 
I kept on ballin for a minute 
Then I spot this bitch 
This ho was so fine man 
Big tities she was good to go 
Like a nice lil' blond bitch 
With skin that was white as snow 
I said what's your name bitch 
She said her name was Nicole 
I said where you headin 
She said with you if you let me roll 
Shit hop in bitch 
You ain't said shit but a word 
I paid her you turn so fast 
Ran my ass on the fuckin curb 
We got you a drill 
But I said to myself this bitch lip is swell 
Fuck them two kid's man 
I need to hit this shit she bail 
I lit up a swisher 
And I looked at the wall and said oh shit 
I know this ain't who I think it is on this picture bitch 
I said is this O.J. 
That bitch nodded her head yes 
I hurried up and got up 
And kicked this bitch in her fuckin chest 
Where you know this nigga from 
How you get this krill bitch 
The bitch said I'm married to the nigga 
And he's filthy rich 
At that very moment I knew I had ran up on this thang 
I kicked that bitch again 
And I reached in my draws 
And I pulled out that thang 
Put it up to that bitch head 
And I said to myself I'm a get paid at last 
Bitch I'm a kill you if you don't take me straight to your stash 
Headed up stairs 
And I hit that glock to that bitch dome right 
I can feel that ho tremblin 
With her body so full of fright 
We got to that bitch room 
And I slammed that ho down on the floor 
I started to rape her 
But I heard this strange knock at the door 
Now who could this be 
Fuckin my stain 
They must be served 
I told that bitch shhhh 
Be quiet 
Don't say a fuckin word 
I fell downstairs 
And I looked at the window 
And I seen this trick 
He fuckin up my stain 
So I better get rid of this nigga quick 
I opened up the door 
And I said come in let me take your coat 
When he turned his head 
I stuck hI'm twice and I slit his throat 
I dragged his body into this room 
And I locked the door 
I blew back upstairs 
To get finished rapin on that ho 
When I got back to the room 
That bitch had vanished without a trace 
I heard some glass brakin 
That bitch led me on a chase 
I chased that bitch down the stairs 
To the front door and I beat her down 
I stuck on that bitch until her bloody body hit the ground 
I slit that bitch throat as well 
And I bail from the murder scene 
I'm back on the highway ballin 
I'd a made my getaway clean 

Yeah motherfucker 
That goes to show you anybody could of did that shit 
But it's all about money in this game 
And it's all about murder 
Innocent until proven guilty 
And I'm out 
I will see you in hell mother fuckers </pre>
