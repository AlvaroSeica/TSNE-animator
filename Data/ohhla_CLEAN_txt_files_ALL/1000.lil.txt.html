[Intro]
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God Basedgod
I gotta tell you something
OH. MY. God. Lil B, guess what?
Guess what? I heard something. I heard a rumor
Guess what? You did a great job
Oh my God, I heard you fucked a thousand bitches
You need a trophy!

[Chorus]
I fucked a thousand bitches, I fucked a thousand bitches (OKKKAAYYYY)
Fucked a thousand bitches, I fucked a thousand bitches (OKKKAAYYYY)
Fucked a thousand bitches, I fucked a thousand bitches (SWAG! DAMN! BASEDGOD!)
Fucked a thousand bitches, I fucked a thousand bitches (YOU DID GREAT! OKKKAYYY!)

[Verse]
I get pussy cause I ride 26's
I got a trophy cause I fucked a thousand bitches
Bitches love me and it's still fuck the system
46 bitches and they call me David Stern
Felt my bitch up, I told that bitch to get a perm (SLOW DOWN BASEDGOD)
I flex bitches, I flex bitches (SLOW DOWN, LIL B)
I'm powered up, I'm riding the bitch and she's trippin
I ride Bentley coupe, the bitch wanted to fuck me
She want to fuck Basedgod, I told her I'm a biznitch

Smart bitches love me, they call me Metta Metta (I got bitches)
Bitch I look better. Take off your sweater
21 bitches wanna write me a letter (I flex bitches, so what?)

Fucked a thousand bitches, I fucked a thousand bitches (SWAG! DAMN! BASEDGOD!)
Fucked a thousand bitches, I fucked a thousand bitches (YOU DID GREAT! OKKKAYYY!)</pre>
