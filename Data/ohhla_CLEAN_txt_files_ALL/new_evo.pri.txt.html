Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Yea yea yea yea yea yea

Tell it to the birds and stones and cheese
Birds in the sky, scout to me
Sticks have made them rolling skis
Black and my hat's Lebanese
Fishin bait and chimpanzees
Moscow sold them televi
You and me - we die, we bleed
Come on, come on, make it under me

We gotta dance, we gotta shout
Ain't over, figure it out
Cause we are part of the new evolution
Dance to the sound of the revolution

We are one under the sun
Under the sun we are one
Under the sun we are one
Under the sun yea yea yea yea

People are dangerous, that's what said Gandhi
That I'm a little busy but business card games
If I don't shout he's gonna shot me
Then the crime rage droppin and the party's rockin
I'm quoting Gandhi, I feel so superior
That's the problem legal, run to the cafeteria
Don't leave the lizard boy finna speaker, you the teacher
Kyle got the ether, whatever things you need

We gotta dance, we gotta shout
Ain't over, figure it out
Cause we are part of the new evolution
Dance to the sound of the revolution

We are one under the sun
Under the sun we are one
Under the sun we are one
Under the sun yea yea yea yea

I got my face on the back of the CD
Now I can see me and you can see me
I can see you and you can see me
I can see you, you can see me

Got the Christians, jewish, islam
Sing together on this long song
Rich, poor, poorer and everything else
Above your neighbor as yourself
I'm getting to appreciate, you get a little sleepy
Sluts dance sweety, go away to Tahiti
Sound the pencils, you could stop this pity
Just buy the CD

We gotta dance, we gotta shout
Ain't over, figure it out
Cause we are part of the new evolution
Dance to the sound of the revolution

We are one under the sun
Under the sun we are one
Under the sun we are one
Under the sun yea yea yea yea

Come and dance baby, come on take a chance brother
Uh clap it baby uh uh
Shake it shake it shake it yeah
Look by, the summer start
A sook ya know bout none you took
You don't what that means
Are you really cutting back?

We gotta dance, we gotta shout
Ain't over, figure it out
Cause we are part of the new evolution
Dance to the sound of the revolution

We are one under the sun
Under the sun we are one
Under the sun we are one
Under the sun yea yea yea yea

We are one under the sun
Under the sun we are one
Under the sun we are one
Under the sun yea yea yea yea</pre>
