It's so easy, when everybody's tryin' to please me
I was just leaving, got important stuff to do like buy shoes and hate you
War is the perfect excuse to do everything bad I ever wanted to do
Because nothing really matters when nothing really matters to anyone that matters

Come on, get it out, tear it out, take it out of me
Come on, get it out, suck it out, take it all from me

Yeah you're real stoned now, high on power and cocaine
Even though nobody good took that since 1979, fuck it, gimme a line
I meant a line for my song, everything is wrong, living in oblivion is really fun
Got a hole deep in my soul, cliche, but hey, hey, hey, hey

Come on, get it out, tear it out, take it out of me
Come on, get it out, suck it out, take the artery

Time to reassess my mission
Wish I had religion for some nice tunnel vision
Go head, get that smile you get on your face
When you get a taste, but just in case, remember I can press erase
I've got two friends to take care of me, apathy and technology
I'm such a commodity, a musical comedy, everyone wants a part of me

And then I had a dream that everybody on Earth died except for me
I went to the mall, you know, like that movie
And when I woke I thought, is that all there is
Is that all there is

Come on, get it out, tear it out, take it out of me
Come on, get it out, suck it out, take it all from me
Come on, tear it out, spit it out, take it out of me
Come on, get it out, suck it out, take the artery

Come on, get it out, tear it out, take it out of me
Come on, get it out, suck it out, take it all from me
Come on, tear it out, spit it out, take it out of me
Come on, get it out, suck it out, take th artery</pre>
