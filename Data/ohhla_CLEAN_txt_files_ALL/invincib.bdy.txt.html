[Intro: Ice-T]
BC baby, got Trigger Tha Gambler
SMG in the house!

[Chorus: Together X3]
Play the game, get cash, get paid
Get your money, get your power, get your bitches man!

[Verse One: Ice-T]
It's simple easy don't rock to vote
Get your guns, get your dope, that's all she wrote
Lock your blocks, cock your glocks, get your gang in check
Fuck the cops, get your money, stack that street respect
Get your cars on them big rims, chrome is a must
Keep your strap at your hip, nigga ready to bust (BLAWW!)
Don't sleep, keep your hustle air tight and fly
Don't worry in the street life nobody dies!

[Chorus: Together X3]

[Verse Two: Trigger Tha Gambler]
First is the power man, make ends to pepper fame
Get respect, get respect, protect to your haters man
Stash them in gators, damn, get money, fuck the bitch
Cause you can do that bullshit in a later plan
Focus on your tips, slang bricks, pack guns
Shoot a nigga, fuck the bank rob, store stack ones
Slang weed, cook grips, bubble that block
If your money ain't lift you right, hustle that rock
And fuck the cop

[Chorus: Ice-T X3]

[Verse Three: Ice-T]
I ain't afraid of you, cause none of y'all can kill me
I ain't afraid of you, cause nobody can kill me
I ain't afraid of you, cause none of y'all can kill me
I ain't afraid of you, cause nobody can kill me
I ain't afraid of you, cause none of y'all can kill me
I ain't afraid of you, cause nobody can kill me
