yea come walk with me let me show you what the world is really like
its more than just black and white
come take a stroll with the killa yeh

[Verse One]
I'm not a beaner jalepeno or a papi either
Don't call me meda and don't call my woman mamacita
Call me Zapatista, Pancho Villa, knowledge seeker
aztec warrior killa not no taco eater
I get my lessons from che so fuck yo college teacher
ovatusani lead the way and he was our leaders
I'm always sober never clouded by the sour disel
seen black people enslaytinos like juan carrido
they say islam is evil 
so is santa maria
I channel the spirts of college from montelucia
so whats a mosque by ground zero
to catholic churches on top of myan ruins and murals of our folk heros
they use the spanish inquisition 
to rid the social ills now we cancer in remission
killa you know the deal now we back stronger
Can't kill us cause we driven
black panther stanley tooke williams relive it lets go

its more than just being some o regular hispanic dude
its some revolution shit
just like its more than being just some average black dude
this is some next level stuff right here

[Verse Two]
Don't call me nigga don't call me kushy don't call me coon
Don't call my woman cuss and don't call me a black baboon
Call me congo call me wolouf call me cameroon
Call me king of the yoruba call me a maroon
Call me sambo warrior huego chaves platoon 
Call it african music don't call it latin tunes
Call it crazy but the cherokee kept slaves too
the redman put the blackman in chains too
they tried to change you
your vodoo ritual your powerful drums
they dumb it down in negro sprituals
they hysterical they scared of the sound 
so they put skyscrapers on your burial grounds
and we tearing it down its an all out slave rebillion
since we escaped they wanna kill ya for trying to aide a felon
they try to weaken us like samson with the lady villan
but I'm on seymour blvd it aint no way to kill em

you know what I'm sayin everybody always stuck on whats a sterotype
and whats this and whats that
walk with me
let me show you something different
show you what the new americas about
yaknowhatimsayin

[Verse Three]
Don't call me Haji camel jockey or a towel head
Don't call my wife Kadesha diva and joke about her dress
Don't say I get that arab money or that saudi bread
I'm not a terroist aint down with norehavisa
Don't call me al qaeda suicde powder keg about to blow 
than put my whole family on house arrest
Call me malcom x I gave you algebra to alphabets
I gave the spanish words like atadon and alvarez
I gave physicans for the sick when it was arcaiac
the cresent moon the star david through the dark ages
and we partaked in the slave trade the same way the europeans did
so who I kid trying to save grace
but god forgives cause we all from the same race
all from the same place all of the same faith
and I aint talking bout one religon
I'm talking bout one people see the light in my tunnel vision</pre>
