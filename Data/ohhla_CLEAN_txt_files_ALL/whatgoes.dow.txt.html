[Mr. Shadow]
I'm not like Snoop, talking about the gambino
I'm Mr. Shadow, I got you wet El Nino, ike Nino Brown
But In my part of town, mothafuckas that be wondering
End up on the ground, from the roots of soul
I was born to be a foe, beware nothing
In this world could have scare me, stare me down
Like if you got pops, a barage of gun shots putting and end to the cops
And now it's just me and you, and I'll be seeing you
At your gave for trying to act brave, you could of stayed
But the pigs couldn't wait, and those fools that betrade
For your ass that never prayed, for cheers if you never shed a tear
Now you sleep with the maggots you mothafuckin faggots
Your clan should have never ran cause I'm the man
Mr. Shadow gots you mothafuckers stranded in my land

[Chorus] (2x)
What goes around comes around, the tables turns
It's the Shadow of your death come back I'm gonna burn
You slip away slow but I won't it go, what goes around comes around
[Repeat]

[Mr. Shadow]
I walk up in the cemetry and I was buried
But then I made out when you thought you laid me out
And now it's all about the pay back, think of way back
I'm your terror, your enemy forever, so let's call the preist
Ain't no peace til deaseced, I be the first mothfucka to release
My demon, I know I got you dreamin and screamin, stirring up the news
Cause you heard I broke the rules, never leaving clues, I'm refusin to lose
Every fool that I stake, bes belive I payed my dues, many clues that took
Live my life as a crook, take look where ya step or I might ressurect
And Huantcha, bitch mothafucka cause I wantcha
Teach ya'll a lesson that your momma never taughtcha,
I shotcha, took ya for the life you were living, your enemy for life
And you still see me grinning

Chorus

[Mr. Shadow]
I'll see you in the next life, I'll be waiting
If you think you've seen the last of me, you're mistaking
Now you don't have to ask, let me run you down the facts
They way you bust raps is the way up bust caps, fuck the snaps
I gave you all my testimony, you're a fruad you's a fake
And forever be a fony, now throw away your fantasy
That you were me, but never could it be, because I'm bigger then the sea
I saw ya coming, I was walking you were running,
And all of a sudden I was pointin and blastin, at you
I was taking away every day that you lived, and I never forgive
Unforgiven, physco way I was driven with the evils how I'm livin
6 letters in my name, 6 thoughts up in my brain, 6 shots from my slug
Gotcha wakin up in a frame, a memory of you but it's all because of me
Till you paid for your sins is the day I set you free

Chorus </pre>
