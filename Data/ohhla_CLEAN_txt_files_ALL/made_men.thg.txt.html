[Killa Tay]
I'm at the point of no return, fuck what you talkin'
I want money like Big Worm, I ain't tryin' to get burned
I learned the hard way so now everyday is a holiday
It's dirty, but it's the game that we gotta play
It's all the same from L.A. to the Bay
??? full of pot heads chasin' the pain
They say the streets ain't safe, so everybody ride strapped up
??? got it locked, locked the block it's like that
I got goons posted up at the room
Still coming home smellin' like gun powder and perfume
Still real from the womb to the tomb
I bring goons, still riding, signing autographs shining like the moon
Step wrong,I light up your life like Pat Goon
Don Dada when the gat boom
Read the headlines, niggaz doin' fed time stuck in the prison
That ain't livin', I know you probly felt like snitchin'
But read what you saw that's what the good book tell us
If you ain't M-O-B, you either shook or you jealous
'Cause we ain't playin' with Pellut Guns, you suckas keep bumpin' ya guns
So now you finally gettin' fucked like Nuns
It's halocaust, we gon' hall 'em off
All that floss got you headed on a one way trip to a coffin
Fuck talkin' I'm walkin' front line with Bo
Until my shine don't glow or it's my time to go
But...

[Yukmouth]
Geah.. nigga
Spark the ganja up, H2 Tonka truck
26 deep dish make my shit look like a monster truck
Gettin' swallowed up by a gangsta bitch, Gobble up
Y'all be givin' dollas up for pussy, Bitches sponsor us
In the Mob we trust it's the Mafia, La Kosta Nostra
Lots of Coke and lots of Doja, Lots of Souljas
Mobstas focus, in drops and Rovers
Front work to the block controlla, let him rock 'n roll ya
Carson Daly, flossin' daily, and drive Mercedes it ain't all gravy
Fuck y'all pay me, cross the Mob lose your broad and baby
Police they all hate me, I ball like McGrady
And I'm the one like "Neo", still Desert Eagle
Keep throwin' bricks like Shaquille at a free throw
Yuk and C-Bo the sequel
Made niggaz that'll have ya wacked like the Beatle in Casino
Nigga...

[C-Bo]
Got the Benz on 20's, the Porsche on 19's
10 Millimeter clips extended to 19's
Ya never ever cross a killa that's like me
Tank top, white tee, jeans and Nike's
Bangin' since the first day Reagen got elected
Yeah, since the first day AIDS got detected
I ain't got a problem with touchin' or bustin' it's nothin'
Like AIDS, ya get it like ??? Huston
The vest won't protect ya, it just slow ya down
Let the gauge racket go up, bet it blow you down
When it come to my money don't play ho
You'll have us on your ass like the attack of the killer tomatos
I was born with a halo, turned into horns
Said I was evil my every step would burn through the floor
I'm tired of life, my every turn is to the morgue
Ya little sister grew up in church and turned into a whore...
