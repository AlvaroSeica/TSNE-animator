[Intro]
Yeah, this that real shit
Motherfucker I'm back wit it, you feel me?
I got ten felonies, let's get it, yo...
I got one felony...

I got one felony, I got two felonies
I got three felonies, I got fo' felonies
I got five felonies, I got six feloines
I got seven felonies, bitch I'm Bill Bellamy
I got eight felonies, I got nine felonies
And if I'm fucking lyin, turn my soul into a skeleton
Niggaz know wassup, I'll come in and I will get you
A hunnid grand show just to show 'em I'm a pimp too

[Chorus]
I got one felony (swag!), I got two felonies (swag!)
I got three felonies (swag!), I got fo' felonies (WOO!)
I got five felonies (WOO!), I got six feloines (WOO!)
I got seven felonies, I got eigh- (bitch, I'm Bill Bellamy)
I got eight felonies (WOO!), I got nine felonies (WOO!)
I got ten felonies (yah!), bitch I'm Bill Bellamy (Yah!)
I got ten felonies (swag!), bitch I'm Bill Bellamy (WOO!)
I got ten felonies (swag!), bitch, I'm Bill Bellamy

YOU goin shoppin, FUCK goin shoppin
Tiny pants goon, pink shirt and a chopper
I'ma come in and I'ma straight disrespect
I'ma tell you like this, I'ma show you who's the bitch (okay)
Got a Armenian girlfriend and she fuck wit me
Pull the hammer out, make the bitch 360 (60)
I swear to God, I'ma go so fuckin dumb
The bitch call me R. Kelly, I'ma fuck her in the ass - SWAG!

[Chorus]

Westside gangstas, southside gangstas (swag!)
Eastside gangstas (swag!), northside gangstas (swag!)
Waterfront boy, I'ma rep 'til I'm ancient
Bitch, I go dumb and I'm hyphy and alla that
Bitch Mob, pretty boy nigga, you better fall back
Young BasedGod, I run this shit and I'm all that
Still got the Glock and I still got the 40
Put me under pressure and I'ma pull a Robert Horry - SHOOT!
...
You know these niggaz talkin 'bout, what they doin
Like I said, I got ten felonies, bitch I'm Bill Bellamy
I got the streets back, I took the streets back over just like that
Lil B, nigga, I (AM) the hood, nigga
Let's get it, I'm Bill Bellamy, let's get it

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
