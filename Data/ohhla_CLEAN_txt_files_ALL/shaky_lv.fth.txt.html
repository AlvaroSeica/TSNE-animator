[Intro: unknown reggae artist]
Don't give me no shaky, shaky love..
Don't give me no shaky..

[Chorus: unknown reggae artist]
Don't give me no shaky, shaky love..
Don't give me no shaky, shaky love, girl I don't want it
Don't give me no shaky, shaky love, I don't deserve it
Don't give me no shaky, shaky love, girl I don't want it
Don't give me no shaky, shaky love, I don't deserve it

[unknown reggae artist]
I gave you all my lovin', I gave you everything
I gave you my affection, and even let you wear my ring
Now you see the light (the light, the light)
Girl you'll stand up right
Now you see the light (the light, the light)
Girl you'll stand up right

[Chorus]

[unknown reggae artist]
I gave you all my lovin', I gave you everything

[Kurupt]
Yeah nigga, smash the streets, cock the heat
Clear the streets, pop and sweep
Pop the heat all over a motherfuckin' bitch
Cause this shits all over a motherfuckin' bitch
Ain't this a bitch (bitch), I gotta switch up
And get the homegirl, key you to beat the bitch up
Take  a ride, ride 'em by, homicidal homicide
Square life hepticide, runnnin' wide
Bunnin' high, runnin' by, gunnin' I
Let all like 35, never gave a fuck about
what these niggaz talkin' bout
Exercise like calisthenics, Columbine and California
Exorcism in the rhythm, poltergeism, why forgive em?
In the Act, front to back, switches hittin' front to back
Switches switchin' in the 'Lac, what the fuck you lookin' at?

[Killah Priest]
My niggaz got teeth like canines, drinkin' St. Ide's
Throwin' up gang signs at the same time
They bang nines, on cop swap bitches yellin' "Stop!"
Niggaz is fellas, we got glocks the size of blocks
Bitches goin' in niggaz socks
Fightin' bitches gonna get a nigga knocked
Fightin' and fussin', arguin' and cussin'
Bitch, I told you that was my cousin
Some bitches cause wars, some bitches are here for a cause
Virtuous women are envied by whores
Soft paws, high claws, some bitches are fightin' southpaw
Some bitches grab the 44 and place 'em on the side of niggaz jaws
Some bitches are sea hags, with titties like tea bags
Some bitches when you bone 'em, you need three bags, shit

[Canibus]
Don't give me none, I don't want no
Don't give me none, I don't want no
Don't give me none, I don't want no
Don't give me none, I don't want no
Don't give me no shaky love, this ain't a game to us
Dangerous Jamaican thugs that came to bust
Now it's time to see me rock the beat properly
I'm constantly, showin' mothafuckas in a entirely different saname
One minute I'm cool, and everything is fine with me
The next minute, I'll be hangin' your ass over the balcony
Screamin' loudy, what a pussy you turned out to be
Police shoutin' out to me, negotiators counsellin' me
I told 'em I calmed down of the, give me a pound of weed
Bring his ass upstairs, and listen to my album
We talked a little, sparked a little
Laughed a little, I bragged a little
Negotiator said he let me go if acted civil
And he did too, thats why I'm givin' it up
He didn't double cross me with that fake shaky love

[Outro: unknown reggae artist]
Cause I don't deserve it</pre>
