[M-Dash]
Yeah, Platinum Bound Mixtape	
This is it y'all
Fire up wit me mayne [fire up, blaze that shit up nigga]
M-Dash, Platinum Bound
Hey, what	
The Big Bay Area
Where we from?
The Big Bay Area
West Coast
The Big Bay Area
It's the incredible
Natural Born Dankstas Bitch
You wanna know about the West Coast
Take a trip to the Bay
Through Valley Joe and E.P.A
Frisco, Oakland, to the 408
Eliminate mutha fuckas talkin' all out they character
West Coast shit like the Seattle Mariners
Independent game got it all wrapped up
We Bay niggaz
We all act nuts, mutha fucka!
Catch five niggaz out in front of Rasputin's
Slangin' boxes of units with no distribution
Money's the solution
Causin' confusion
M-Dash shit, they the one producin'
Mixtape music got me buildin' a buzz
Feelin' the love
SUV chillin' on dubs
Still in the club
Tryin' to get my CD played
It's too much fuckin' politics these days
Tell the DJ: Play some mutha fuckin'
Mac Dre, B-Legit, Richie Rich, or some Young Lay
R.B.L., Cougnut, Cellski, and San Quinn
If it ain't the Bay throw it in the trash bin [throw that shit out]
Critics don't give us the respect we deserve
But they takin' our slang
And stealin' our words
I'm so disturbed
It's from the Bay fuck what you heard
N.B.D. is about to emerge
The brand new superb
So high shit I flew wit the birds
Sticky gooey weed is what I prefer
Keep my niggaz on alert
Bay Niggaz come to your work
Shuttin' shit down runnin' your turf, mutha fucka! [what, what]
Bay Shit
The Big Bay Area
Where you from?
The Big Bay Area
West Coast
The Big Bay Area
Bay shit, Bay shit
The Big Bay Area</pre>
