[Intro]
Some shit I keep to myself
There's some shit that's just ours
Some shit that's sacred
But I had to write this letter to you
I wish I could do better for you
Just tryin my best, I'm tryin my motherfuckin best

[Slaine]
18 years, some days are cloudy as shit
Most of 'em are sunny for me to think now we should split
It's fuckin horrifyin years, saw some cowardly shit
We spent years together for you to hour hour me it's
kust a slap in the face, like we're trapped in a place
We both took an oath, how could you be reactin this way?
I admit, I've been doin too much Captain and yay
We grew up together, best friends from back in the day
It wasn't my fault that destiny had happened this way
I desperately, had a passion to be rappin this way
I was testin roads from the rock bottom to a top problem
of this villain-filled killing field
If I'm not violent and they kill I'm killed
Every day I'm tested if my will is real
I come home and fill our drawers up with hundred dollar bills
I take care of our son
Love him with the fullest heart, and now we're gettin pulled apart
I don't wanna see this happen, I don't really
It hurts me so much to touch you when you don't feel me
I refuse to believe that we'll ever die
We won't really, we both prayin my addiction don't kill me
I love you so much I'll die for, lie for you
Cry for you, pull every last one of the stars out the sky for you
How can you doubt what I would do?
Why would you? How could you ever think those lies are true?
I love you

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
I still look to the sky and I pray you and I
stay together 'til the day that we die
When you tell me we will fall back to Earth
I will say we can fly - so how crazy am I?

[Slaine]
Yeah I been crazy baby, now I've never been as hated
Maybe I degenerated, maybe I've just been afraid of
my sinnin and my ways of renegade-ish pride
And ever since we had Terrance I've been afraid to die
I wish my childhood was all lemonade and pie
But everything the world told me always been a straight up lie
I feel like Jesus Christ, just another made up guy
And I'm startin to feel like eating a fuckin grenade and I
hate my life, I hate my face
I can't escape this place, I have turned to evil
I'm consumed by this paper chase
If only we could reconnect with loneliness
And beat this hectic freakin wreck that we grew up in
I bet you that we could get, everything back I just want my family
It's gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity
Fuck it, I'm bitin Tupac yeah, for my rhymes
And I stuffed 'em in a shoebox there, you were there

[Scratching from Pharcyde's "Passin' Me By"]
"I just play love by ear and hope she gets the picture"
"I'm shootin for her heart, got my finger on the trigger"

[Chorus]</pre>
