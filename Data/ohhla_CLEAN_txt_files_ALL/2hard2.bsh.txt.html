[Intro: Unidentified Artist #1]
Don't fucker don't! Ha ha (*Gun Shot*)
Yeah ain't no bangers in this motherfucking joint nigga
Just niggaz on some mack, player-listic, real shit!

Come.. coming again but I'ma get them (*Gun Shot*)

Come.. coming again but I'ma get them (*Gun Shot*)

[Verse One: Bushwick Bill]
I see you punk motherfuckers trying to mix me
In a place where a mark old bitch would be
So I guess, I gotta let that fucking thug out
Bug out, I'm seeing you dead niggaz drug out
I know you saying damn I hate him
But gats ventilating talking niggaz bodies like Mentholatum
I caught a nigga like that; when I was clubbing confronted him
Then I dumped off in his chest
Motherfucker thought I was bluffing when I let it known
Nigga, anything that's my business please leave it alone
And fools gonna have to learn this bullshit the hard way
And I'll be stuck for life, where the bard's stay
I give a fuck about your bitch-ass
There'll be a lot of motherfuckers in this world wearing shit bags
Fuck talk, all I do is shoot nigga
I been pushed too motherfucking far nigga

[Chorus: Bushwick Bill]
You fools done fucked around and you tried to hard to test
Now I'm coming with some shit to crush to vest
Even a small soldier got a point when he gotta snap
And blow you rotten motherfuckers off the map
You fools done fucked around and you tried to hard to test
Now I'm coming with some shit to crush to vest

"So why in the fuck you wanna act up?
Known when I can shoot your ass and your chest and blow your back up"

[Verse Two: Bushwick Bill]
Dollars and Sense is a motherfucking player crew
But God damn it, players have beef too
And it's usually you jealous-ass niggaz
But sometimes even them whores' heads get bigger
And Mr. Chuck's too short to buy that
Shocked when I glocked that bitch, wear your weave tied whore
Because the game done changed and it's strange
How when a niggaz dentures; be the next niggaz name to flip
When they see a playful nigga, like me bust a cap
Now Mr. Chuck got a murder rap
And now they wanna stop me from breathing
But them better believe that me got something up my sleeve
Bully-bye-bye, bye bye, when I drive by
Die die, when the motherfucking bullets fly
I didn't ask for this shit but you brought it to me
You played pussy now get fucked, you pushed me

[Chorus]

[Verse Three: Unidentified Artist #2 Impersonates Scarface]
Now I have no remorse, one slip of the tongue 
And now we're making arrangements for your corpse
My body turns into the left field
Counting up the body count as I hear the caps peel
Now I wasn't known for eating the flesh of the enemies
Stalking you in packs so the killers done with these
Ripping your flesh now you're only seconds from your death
Feel your heart pounding while you're taking your last breath
I hear you saying that you ain't scared to die
Then reality sets in, gun shots rings, and now you start to cry
I guess you never knew how it would be
You messed up with me, now eternally you will rest in peace
You should've never played no games with me
You should've never sparked no flames with me
And now you understand your life is scarred
You played a deadly game and it's a shame I had to pull your card

[Chorus]</pre>
