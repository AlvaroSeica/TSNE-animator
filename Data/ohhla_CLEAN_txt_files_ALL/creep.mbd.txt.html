[Havoc]
That's that creep, creep mode baby we in creep mode
Don't come around here baby, shining like that

[Verse-Havoc]
Its crazy on this side, come thru, gun thru
Oh ya man live out here, don't go and get comfortable
Don't know what he told you ain't sweet around here
and I don't care what he told you ain't sweet around here
See you riding that Infinity, now that's not fair
What's that a 2006?, OK
Playboy we got balls that ain't made all day
You comin' thru the hood straight dangling state
We takin' medium-rare, grilled debatin us
Letting' that slide's not up for debate
Oh you met, you a local guess what she bait
She don't know right now but trust me the bitch bait
I won't get all in the business, that shorty is mad cool
My man was diggin' at but she a lil' bit nasty to
First time we catch you comin' out the building we snatch you
and takin' what's yours, first thing we ask you is

[chorus-Havoc]
Fuck brought ya ass around here
Like you somebody looking' like the player of the year, boy
Fuck brought ya ass around here
This is Queens lil' homie get caught around here, yea
Fuck brought ya ass around here
Comin' thru for these bitches, shit happen around here, yea
Fuck brought ya ass around here
Like niggas got something' to live for around here

[Verse-Prodigy]
You ask me all these rappers is bums
Hav showed me the flow and I ran with it dun
I mean really, y'all got to be the most worst
rap shit I ever heard compared to P verse
We emerge on the scene
Everything seems, stop, watch is very bling bling
Nigga wanna swing swing, very much so
but once we get in the air, that's a wrap bro
Our songs good to go straight to the radio
Flex easy on the bomb let these niggas hear to flow
We Americas most dangerous to have fans
New York New York, we the kings of the dam
We party too much and smoke too much grass
and we never see the bright side we only see the bad
Fuck all that, its a lot of niggas dead
and I wont let Â‘em get me how they got them

[Chorus-Havoc]
Fuck brought ya ass around here
Like you somebody looking' like the player of the year, boy
Fuck brought ya ass around here
This is Queens lil' homie get caught around here, yea
Fuck brought ya ass around here
Comin' thru for these bitches, shit happen around here, yea
Fuck brought ya ass around here
Like niggas got something' to live for around here

[Verse-50 Cent]
Yea,
Cock that, aim that, squeeze that, shoot the steel
Cadillac Coupe De Ville, wood grain on the wheel
Cocaine in the pot, baking soda water hot
When the ice cubes drop, look at that, that's crack
Bag that, nigga stack, black hoody fitted hat
Grimy nigga with a gat screamin' "where the money at"
My hood Southside, riders ride that's right
Yayo he know, Banks know, Buck know
shit it ain't about the dough I ain't really with it yo
Camouflage on the low, ridin' round with the heat
I ain't say wassup to you, nigga you don't know me
I'm on the grind all the time, heavy shine and a nine
clip fill till the tip, stunt I get on some shit
different day different bitch, old hoopdy new kicks
Oldsmobile fuck that, no rims, hubcaps
keep my eyes open for them niggas that dun buck that

[Chorus-Havoc]
Fuck brought ya ass around here
Like you somebody looking' like the player of the year, boy
Fuck brought ya ass around here
This is Queens lil' homie get caught around here, yea
Fuck brought ya ass around here
Comin' thru for these bitches, shit happen around here, yea
Fuck brought ya ass around here
Like niggas got something' to live for around here</pre>
