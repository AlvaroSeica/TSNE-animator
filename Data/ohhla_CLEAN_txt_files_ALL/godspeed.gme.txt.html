[DJ Skee]
When you hear that sound!
You already know what time it is
I only drop classics!
And we back again with another one
The duo you love to hate!
Live from Los Angeles
The Game
I am {DJ SKEE}

[The Game]
Want y'all to understand what I'm 'bout to do
Keep it gangster in this Louis Vuitton designer suit
In front of Club Liv, stuntin in that Massi' Coupe
Then we're gonna check China, see what King of Diamonds do
Pass the kush to A.R., when I recline the roof
That nigga get down for me like I'm 'bout to shoot
Tell 'em it's Money Gang; my nigga Sonic real
And Kid Red be runnin trains like a monorail
Introduce you to my team, niggaz you need to know
We poppin spades the bottles look like C3PO
Blowin that loud, security tellin us to keep it low
But when you pay me for a walk-through this is what you need to know
We smokin all night, Kev got a handle for me
And tell the owner them twelve bottles is mandatory
And we gon' need a few Cirocs, and them Gooses too
Same go for Greenhouse, and Dream down in Huston too
Watching Malaya eatin shrimp while I throw these ones
Jazz drunk as fuck cause every time I look he show his gun
Every time we in the strip club, he got the coldest one
Surrounded by killers cause J. Prince know his son
And I'm aight with that - cause Rap-A-Lot my fam'
and everytime J ask me can I dot dot? Yeah I can
Cause he been lookin out for me before the Drake co-sign
And I was there when him and when they heard that Drake was gon' sign
But look at Drake now, every time I need somethin
He do it and say

[Drake] Game, holla if you need somethin

[The Game]
And that's loyalty in the industry that's full of snakes
where niggaz send a bottle to your table just to show they face
And bitches stand there looking pretty just to get a glass of Ace
Most of these hoes dumb and ain't nothing but an ass and face
But if you are the ones that's lucky enough to stand up on this couch
make sure as soon as we hop in that Phantom you got them titties out
I hate you fake hoes, I swear I hate you fake hoes
Your fake ass, your fake nose, you never gon' be J-Lo
Nicki put you on that Mike Kors, got you thinkin
that you on the right course to fuck that nigga in that white Porsche
But I got news for you, got a wifey and three kids at home
and I can't even start to count how many times we've been to Rome
My oldest kid is 10 and some, my youngest got his tennis on
and you ain't never seen a four year old swaggin in his Foams
Now they wanna be him cause he rockin colisseums
Used to rock it for the fiends, now he rock with Europeans
All out in Dublin with them green bottles bubbling
Twins I call +Doublemint+ callin me by my government
Swear to God that I'm lovin it; I'm on the beach
with Miss Dominican Republic even she surprised that she suckin it
But don't be surprised that I'm fuckin
Never cuffin, always puffin these bitches know who they fuckin with
I'm the fuckin shit, handsome ass nigga
Fuck with me, I'll fuck with her, you gon' need ransom cash nigga
Now cancel that nigga like my BlackBerry service
Don't believe none of you niggaz till them plaques start surfacin
Niggas get nervous when we hop out them Suburbans
Get to tyin red rags around our head like they turbans
After niggaz merk 'em I'm behind them Phantoms curtains
Headed to Greystone, my alibi is this Persian
Her alibi is this Asianm, I call that a persuasion
From Hollywood lock up to yellin out "bring the spades in"
Dumb bitch right here wanna know why the bottle green
I'm somethin like them golf niggaz, I done seen a lot of green
640 mill'? 'Bout to play the lottery
A rich nigga cain't win twice? Don't lie to me
Cause I'm Donald Trumpin feds, tryin to +Idol+ me
Ain't +No Limit+ in spendin this money "I'm 'Bout It 'Bout It" +P+
I'm who these new rappers try to be
Every new nigga that say "5" becomes a prodigy
And you should honor me! Hang my jersey up? Sure
We got a +Situation+, nigga +Jersey Shore+
Know I'm bout my occupation, know I'm 'bout fuckin these hoes
Know I rock them Louboutins and smoke 'til it's stuck in my clothes
And I got your girl in her comfortable clothes
I'm 'bout to take her lower, what's right up under my nose 
It's Money Gang bitch~! Now watch my company blow
And go from a hot logo to somethin you know
I'm in the Maserati, Jordans punchin the flo'
And you can act like you don't nigga; but...

[Mele]
Either I'm goin too fast, or doin too much
Shut it down all the time when I'm in the club
Uhhhhhhh, uhhhhhhhhh
Yeah I'm always in the zone, chillin with a bad bitch
And she got nothin on, yeah I'm gonna do it
Shut it dowwwwwn
Yeah I'm goin too fast, so fast, so fast
That's God speed, yeah I'm goin too fast
Gooooood speed, that's Gooood speed
Said I'm goin too fast, so fast
Yeah I'm always in the zone, chillin with a bad bitch
And she got nothin on, yeah I'm gonna do it
Shut it dowwwwwn
Yeah I'm goin too fast, so fast
Gooood speed, goin too fast
Goooood speed, that Gooood speed
Said I'm goin too fast... so fast
Gooood
