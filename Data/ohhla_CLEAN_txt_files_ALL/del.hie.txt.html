[Casual]

Drop some new shit on 'em them
Let's drop some new shit on 'em

[Opio]

Drop it on 'em Cas

[Casual]

Some brand new new shit
Going

[Del]

Yeah, this D-E-L in the house
And Hieroglyphics crew
Down wit' Matt Kelly, A-Plus, Domino
Man, we about to kick this little shit right here on my down time on the 
album
Check it out

MC's is too promiscious so if you fuss
I'ma be the next to bust and take you on the Exodus
Wreckless
Checklist, ain't nobody next to us
Step to us and get reduced to a speck of dust 
Fuck the hellala detectives with they secret societies
We speak wit' variety
So stand back
Before you caught in my sand traps
Hilarious you better vary it, you bury it
Go along with your merriment 
Hiero getting ever cent
And we earned it, and burned it
In your brains like brands
And now, everyone demands
Del and his entourage and you can all get squashed
He mosh it up, we mega and vicious
Magnificent
Fuck the whimsical misteral
We stiffed through competitors and regulate 
And make you hesistate you better wait
Time to set it straight
You never take a flow for granted
Cause what you ain't peeping
Is equal to what we call "sleeping"
Slumbering and fucking cumbersome
Keep the tabs on them tongues
And let the bomb numb your lungs
Yeah
Cranialologist 
The zany novelist
The tactical graphical
With lyrics for capital
After you, high speed chase
To erase
All existing life forms and drive 'em to free base

[Coughing]
