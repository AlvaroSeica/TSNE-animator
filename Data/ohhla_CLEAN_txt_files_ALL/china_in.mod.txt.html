[Eric Singleton]
From New York to Hong Kong
Then back again
It's the number one fun maker in the nation
Making you dance

She wanna rub me down, keep my muscles strong
Keep it going off, New York to Hong Kong
Think of something freakier in a crazy form
As long as I don't have to put my pants back on
She's the girl I never had, she's the girl of my dreams
A body like a Lamborgini covered in jeans
Too much for a man much more than I can stand
Wanna pack my bags, and move to Japan

[Modern Talking]
She has China in her eyes - can you see it?
China in her eyes - can't you feel it?
China in her eyes - a secret smile

Oh can't you see
It's you and me
My China woman, oh no
I miss you so
Can't let you go
My China girl - Don't go

[Eric Singleton]
From Paris to Bankok
I just can't stop
You feel the music all around the world
My China girl
Come on!

Let me get tonight, you know I'll treat you right
Want China in your eyes, `til the morning light
The next day you'll realise, I'll be holding you tight
Because the love we'll be giving, it's dynamite
I wanna freak you here, I wanna freak you there
I wanna run my fingers through your hair
Tall as the China wall I wanna feel the world
Let nothing come between me and my China girl

[Modern Talking]
She has China in her eyes -can't you see it
China in her eyes - can't you feel it
China in her eyes - a secret smile

Oh can't you see
It's you and me
My China woman, oh no
I miss you so
Can't let you go
My China girl - Don't go

She has China in her eyes - can you see it?
China in her eyes - can you feel it?
China in her eyes - a secret smile

Oh can't you see
It's you and me
My China woman, oh no
I miss you so
Can't let you go
My China girl - Don't go

[Eric Singleton]
From the moon to the stars
And all around the universe
This is a dedication to you
China in your Eyes</pre>
