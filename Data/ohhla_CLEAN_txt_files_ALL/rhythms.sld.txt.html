Song:   Rhythm's Last Stand
Typed by: artisticdirector@untimelyripped.com

Take that. Rewind it back
To the time when they only popped shots on tracks

I heard the sounds pistol clicks and cockings
I heard the noise of whisperings and plotting
I could've sworn I heard the walls talk
Before I knew it shots echoed in the hall block
I see the poets who are trading in God for Gotti
Christ and Gandhi for 44's, nines and shotties
I keep talking, I keep on rocking
Alive and spitting. That's why I keep on hawking
Naw no one ever tried to pop me
I guess that's the reason no one's trying to cop me
But if I'm hittin' up rappers on a radio hot feed
The CNN ticker will say that somebody shot me
It's raining blood in Queens, Jamaica projects
Crimson hue floods the skies of Compton
But with all these words I'm dropping 
even with a bullet in the head I ain't stoppin'

[Chorus]
I ain't runnin' from no pistol man
I'll be coming from a distant land
I'll be gunnin with a fisted hand
This is rhythm last stand
I ain't running from no pistol man
I'll be coming from a distant land
I'll be gunning with a fisted hand
This is rhythm's last stand

Verse II
I crack enigmas, break the stigma of the death of rhyming
I swear to God with every single breath I'm trying
I was told you can't avoid the tempting whore of diamonds
But I crush dirty lies with this relentless verbal violence
If there are answers how come I can't seem to find them?
I'm searching for the ring to bring these hip hop kings and bind them
The stalwart God of truth said never stop till the shells stop flying
Now all I have is rap to keep me from dying

[Chorus]

I came to the Game to put in my fifty cents
Came to this madness with the gift of sense
Came to give the defense my best offense
Came to jump the ideological electric fence
When they murk one another they degrade us all
Now everything created will fall
I shed tears for those who spent years
Slave to spread the music while y'all spread fear
Take that, rewind it back
To the time when they only popped shots on tracks
Herc, DMC, Moe Dee. I'm sorry
Rakim, Eric B, Chuck D. I'm sorry
The Jay-Nas feud didn't amount to violence
So why are these cats turning sound to silence?
(Pause) Who turned off the music?
Like this track too loud in your sub, you blew it

[Chorus] repeat

Take that. Rewind it back
To the time when they only popped shots on tracks
Take that. Rewind it back
To the time when they only popped shots on tracks</pre>
