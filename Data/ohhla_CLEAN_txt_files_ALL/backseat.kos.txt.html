Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Now, I'm just chillin' in the sand in a Neil Young style
I'll catch you in a minute, I'd rather chase for a while
I love the east coast, which is west coast
Touch down, butter on toast.

I didn't use to know the art of saying nothing
Is harder then saying something
cause nothing is constantly rushing through
the front door which I lost my keys last week
I can't speak, but you know what I'm saying cause

so don't give me the run around time
it's chasing us down.
I got to keep it moving...

[?]

You led me to a parking lot, and lost the car that
you came with and drove me from the backseat
I like the wind in my face, top-down, music
and rhyming in the backseat

You drove me to a parking lot, and lost the car that
you came with and drove me from the backseat
I like the wind in my face, top-down, music
and riding in the backseat

Josh, Joshua .... Andrew</pre>
