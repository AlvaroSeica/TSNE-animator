-Intro-
The time is now on everything
Took my heart away from money
Aint interested in fame
But I pray that never change
Ambition is priceless
It' s something that' s in your veins
And I put that on my name

-Meek Mill-
Uh, only hope I had was selling dope
Was on my grind cause times were harder than a cellar floor
My momma taught me never steal and never tell on folks
I grew up looking at the niggas that was selling coke
Oh, I was raised by the stop sign
No religion I was getting saved by the glock nine
By the minute I was getting paid like a hot line
Servin' raw fiends was calling, we was dot com
Well connected, well respected and well protected
Aint get accepted, well rejected and now they regret it
Aint get my message, wasn't signal when I was texting
The niggas I was calling was fraud and I learned my lesson
Now I move with aggression, use my mind as a weapon
Cause chances are never given they tooken like interceptions
So throw that pass, I' ll be the Conner back
Me and Folarin(Ralph Folarin-Wale) MMG gon bring that Warner back

-Hook-
Ambition
Easy to dream a dream, but was harder to live it
They gon love me for my Ambition
Easy to dream a dream, but was harder to live it
They gon love me for my Ambition
Easy to dream a dream, but was harder to live it
Look, they gon love me for my ambition
Beautiful music, painting pictures that be my vision

[It speaks for itself, Define Ambition for me]

-Rick Ross-
My ambition to win, just to get me some ends
Help me pay my little rent, maybe sit in a Benz
I saw momma praying as she wait on results
It was hot in the kitchen can I wait on the porch
My father was missing, War Lord Oliver North
Life was diggin' me deeper, I kept on coming up short
Breaking so many laws, waking up in the dark
Who cut my power off? it' s time to move that soft
Not too many options when you coming from the projects
Sittin' in the trap now you moving Cyndi Lauper
Girls wanna have fun, and a nigga with some change
And I doubt that ever change
Ambition is priceless that' s something thats in your veins
And I doubt that ever change
Ambition is my shit and I put that on my name
And I doubt that ever change

-Hook-

-Wale-
Well wishers to my opposition
You nigga probably cop a plea before you cop a pistol
I got nothing against them, they got fucking potential
But every nigga who can read gotta get his issue

Subscribe,niggas reside where all the lions and killers be
And I aint spend a minute up in the streets
But I' m limitless mentally, I' m lyrically Z MC
Lebron shit, I was in a 6 after 23
And family is everything and money is less important
Long as your mama love you, don' t ever love a woman
I got a lot of bitches, they got a lot of feelings
But I got that green on my eyes
And that ain' t no Donnie Simpson
I retire you niggas fuck you and your position
They play so them so slippery niggas can' t even kick it
Y' all rambling talking shit to these bitches
You know you real you don' t say it
You know you real we gon feel it
Ralph (Ralph Falarin-Wale)

-Outro-
Beautiful music, painting pictures that be my vision
They gon love me for my ambition
Easy to dream a dream, but was harder to live it
Look, they gon love me for my ambition
Beautiful music, painting pictures that be my vision
They gon love me for my ambition</pre>
