[Pigeon John]
You look at me, I look at you
From your green eyes, to your dirty shoes
I wanna know ya, what's in your head?
You just dancin over there like without a care
You lookin good, you know you do
Your whole crew got that old attitude
But it's okay baby you deserve it
You're some Molly Ringwald, you can work it

[Chorus]
Hey you! I really wanna know ya
Hey you! I really wanna know ya

[Pigeon John]
My name is John, I'm a bad man
From my crooked hand, all the way to my band
Lemme talk to ya, whisper in ya ear
Tell you little secrets that you ain't s'posed to hear
You're movin like a tornado in Kansas
You're killin this place, I can't handle it
Let me take you out, paint the town red
If I can't have you baby, I'll lay in the bed

[Chorus]

[Pigeon John]
Alright, 'nough of this chit-chat
No busters allowed - Scarecrows! (Yeah! Yeah!)
Calm down! Do me a favor
Just shake your little head like a little bitty girl
Just shake your little head like a little bitty girl
Just shake your little head like a little bitty girl
Just shake your little head like a little bitty girl

[Chorus]

Hawthorne, California
You, SUCKAS~!</pre>
