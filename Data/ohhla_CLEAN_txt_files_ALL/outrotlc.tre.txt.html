[Trey Songz]
I just wanna say thank y'all for the support man
Uh mixtape game kept me alive
Mixtape game started me off
Uh in the mixtape game
I will never give up on the mixtape game and uh
I will always jump on a nigga record and kill it
It's real talk I mean that's just what it is
Yo' record out and it's hot I will jump on it and kill it
Ya dudes might as well stop payin me for these remixes
And uh that what it is, you know what it is
