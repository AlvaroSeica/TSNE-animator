Typed by: AZ Lyrics

We'll take our time 'cause girl we got our whole life
Your sex is incredible it's going on the 12th night

Your body, your body, your body, your body
Your body ad my body every single night
Keep it consistent
There's no such thing as us stopping (just take your time)
Your body and my body every single night
We got a whole life girl
Keep it consistent
There's no such thing as us stopping.

Ooh I got my body and your body every single night
Keep it consistent (just keep it consistent)
There's no such thing as us stopping
I got my body and your body every single night
Now we'll keep doing it, doing it, 'till we get it right

Now excuse little mama, I've been thinking (uh oh uh oh uh oh)
That we would rock together for a reason, yeah (uh oh uh oh uh oh)
Girl i can hear your body calling me (uh oh uh oh uh oh) uh
They way you felt so baby, what's it gonna be? (uh oh uh oh uh oh)
Let's lay up in the bed, throw some music on
'cause when we feel this right, we just can't be wrong
Sleep up in your love, got nowhere to go, oh, no

[Chorus]
Your body and my body every single night
Keep it consistent (just keep it consistent)
There's no such thing as us stopping
There's no such thing as us stopping
Ooh I got my body and your body every single night
Keep it consistent (just keep it consistent)
There's no such thing as us stopping
I got my body and your body every single night
