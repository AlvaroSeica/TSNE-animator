[Chorus: Bronze Nazareth]
Left, left, left, right, left
Left, left, left, right, left
About face!

[June Megalodon]
Guns that rain, flooded pain levels the playing field
Death wish streaks, shoot the gift, man a ill creature
Spill feature, captivates them, parapelegic MC's
And my D's, I bleed three, five seven bleed
Hell make heaven, seven angels, one devil and a mind that meets
Silver Surfer, know preceeding MC
My food for thought, is now my Thought for Food
Levitate and aurora, more box than our Pandora
Dodge women, deathly women'll get 'em
White flags and scrolls of two bones, invade homes
Slay domes, is the pictures I paint
Death march'll get you, point blank

[Chorus]

[Bronze Nazareth]
Yeah, sawed off, fall off the Empire State
Dogs get called off, nigga, a barbered wire face
Hard war chase, for crowns on the cape
Bow down, merchant of fate, words serving face
Get burnt in Exxon lakes, walk the plank, over fresh earthquakes
If he escape to the other side
Still seen it, last birthday, I eliminate
There is no debate, it's true men, a politic
Atomic detonate, Rambo an MC, compound and regulate
Armored tank, think tank, blue steel bayonette
Wink on the kitchen sink, I expose weak link
Then a boat cut it
Ya'll niggas boat like Zeus from Bronze coming
Bitches sell they jewels just to walk on the carpet
I gamble on a rose of a dime before your fork it
Leave shambles in bones in the darkest tarpit
Zodiac killer, body in cement pillar
Iller than bubonic, clean forensic from car pit
Mark grave after they die, then we torch it
Spit musical funeral, MC's forfeit
March of the state of the heaven, the four lost it

[Chorus]

[Kevlaar 7]
The jail still claims, I let a nigga out his cage
Gauge stuck in his rib, tried to fuck with our fame
Insane methods, device grip was destined
You sacrifical lambs pipe wood when tested
The staircase to death, lead you to hell's wind
The ship's careful, tiger shark infested
Walk the glass trail, say nothing else
Ya'll MC's are failed to add on to our wealth
Walk the plank and plunge inside the sun belt
Melt brainwaves in the cage, you burn
We discovered the fire, now the see is your earned
In the belly of the beast, the better bridge is equator
I twist your halo, you pain is my feast
Waves of cut confidence, it's danger and dominance
Accept the dead heart and admit defeat

[Chorus]</pre>
