Song:   Skin to Bone
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Mike Shinoda]
Skin to bone, steel to rust
Ash to ashes dust to dust
Let tomorrow have its way, with the promises we made
Skin to bone, steel to rust

[Mike Shinoda]
Ash to ashes, dust to dust
Your deception, my disgust
When your name is finally drawn, I'll be happy that you're gone
Ash to ashes, dust to dust

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Aaaaaah, ash to ashes dust to dust
Aaaaaah, skin to bone and steel to rust

[Linkin Park]
Right to left, left to right
Night to day and day to night
As the starlight fades to gray, I'll be marching far away
Right to left and left to right

[Chorus]

[Linkin Park]
Let tomorrow have its way, with the promises betrayed
Skin to bone and steel to rust {*3X*}</pre>
