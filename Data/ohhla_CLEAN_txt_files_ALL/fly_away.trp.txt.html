[Verse One]
Even when we not on tour I'm sleeping on the floor
Always on the road, on the couch, or with some girl I don't know
Hear myself say - I gotta go, I gotta leave, we gotta roll
a restless soul, mom I love you, promise I'll give you a call
once we checked out, sound checked, checked in the hotel room
Yeah, I know you want that same kind of perfume
off course I'll get it, get my brother on the phone
Tell grandma I'll help her with that garden stuff as soon as I'm home
We'll sit down and talk when I'm in Västerås
I don't know when, but once I'll get, I'll send you my schedule for shows
I'll call the booking right away, I'm going down to Jay in Malmoe
meet up with the guys in Gothenburg, work on the album
They say, home is where you're heart at, don't know where to start at
got loved ones all over, cross oceans and borders
I mean I love to travel, hate to fly, I want to go, but hate goodbyes
plus it's getting worse - Looptroop is on the rise
At times you'd like to press pause, no more ciaos and adios
but I'll be back in bit, now I'm out, business calls

[Chorus]
I gotta fly away. Gotta catch the train. We gotta catch the plane
but I really can't complain. We gotta fly away. Pack my bags today
We gotta ride the wave. See you in a couple of days

[Verse Two]
I'm sorry for all I'm sorrys that came too late
I'm sorry for the times that I went away
but yo, I'm still here cus my love came to stay
Remember that even though the weather is grey today
I know we had some situations and I hate to say
that I don't know the answers and how to erase the pain
Close your eyes for the things that led us astray
Then open them up towards a straighter way
All I ever wanted was to hear you say my name
Capture this second we'll forever stay the same
I take the blame for all my great escapes
there's a high price to pay for travellin´ state to state
I'm gone right now but you won't wait in vain
I'll be back before you know it to put the aches on layaway
Don't be afraid I know we'll remain ok
till I'll be back keep in touch through the radio waves

[Chorus]
Sometimes I fly away, but don't cry babe, cus you know I love you girl and
you know that you're my world. It's just you and me, that's the way we
supposed to be

[Verse Three]
You flew away like you were scared that I would clip your wings
after five years we haven't kicked it since
but straight up this ain't no pimpin' thing:
You a true queen baby only fit for kings
Maybe I couldn't see in the midst of things
now in my chain of life you're the missin' link
Just to hear your voice used to lift my chin
and I still feel the taste from when I kissed your skin
I'm looking at your picture wishing we'd click again
next time I make sure to get our shit in synch
next time I be your man through the thick and thin
I promise no more committing wicked sins
I buy you a house with a picket fence
get you everything you could give me twins
No bullshit on tour never hittin' skins
chasin' no groupies with chicken wings
Not the type to chain you between bed and kitchen sink
I merely praise the place where your lips begin
Your hips begin - I know you're quick to think:
It's pathetic, but I'd be the richest prince
if you once more unzip and let me sip your drink
Addicted to your love worse than nicotine
But there's too much pain for me to dig within
so I'm a let the music massage my crippled limbs..

[Chorus + Outro]
and just fly away, into my hideaway
sometimes I lie awake and cry the night away
why you had to fly away?
Now you miles away
You took my smile away
why couldn't you have stayed?</pre>
