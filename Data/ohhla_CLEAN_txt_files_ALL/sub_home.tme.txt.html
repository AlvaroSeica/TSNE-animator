Billy's in the basement mixing up the medicine
I'm on the pavement thinking bout some other shit
There's a man in a trench coat sitting in a Lincoln
The phone's tapped so he knows what you've been thinking
Your neighbor's got a cough and you've just been laid off
They pass all the bills they want cuz they've been paid off
They took the L from learning and changed it to earning
If there's a smell in the air it's just your money that's burning
They sip Molotov cocktails and spit lies like fire
If they say you can trust them then they is a liar
You don't need the days of rage to know which way the wind blows
Cuz even when I was little big brother was in the window
There's a lady with a cigarette giving you a pig pen
She wants 500 dollar bills but you only got 10
Look out kid its something you did
God knows when but you're doing it again
Ah get sick get well get a job go to hell
Get laid off and join the army if you fail
They won't pay the teachers so don't follow leaders
Look out for nukes and watch your Geiger meters
Ah get born, get dressed, try to be a success
And if that don't work you can always try death
Jump down a man hole and light yourself a candle
You can't get a grip cuz the vandals took the handles
They say listen to us cuz we know best
And when we get angry they tell us where to protest
Instead of Kent state they kill us with silence
They kill us with neglect, which is a form of violence
This is who we are we don't speak properly
We don't act polite we don't have any money
We waived our rights, we don't own property
We're exactly what you want we're a bunch of dummies

(breakdown)
We're a bunch of dummies

If they wanna lessen the recession
They should lessen their aggression
Instead of war their profession
They should explore the lesson
Of aggravation from oppression
Love or war it should have never been a question
So why have perplexion over peace or a weapon
You only get one life you don't have a second
Cuz what goes around comes around kind of like airplanes
You bomb us, we bomb you 
Until the whole wide world looks like a barbeque
It is the destination it's not about the journey
By any means necessary even if it's dead on the gurney
They'll make it look like a suicide just ask Gonzo 
Cuz if you tell the truth then they'll lay you horizontal
It's socialism for the rich and free market for the poor
It's funny they pick their fights then send us to war
They bailout themselves but never the bums
They give the bread to the rich and tax our crumbs
Adam smith turned us all into merchandise
I take three hundred and sixty steps in a circle of lies
the invisible hand got arthritis and amputated
We don't need prisons we need food, that's why were aggravated
I'm pulled over on the highway, these snakes blink sideways
Their forked tongues ain't my food and their trying to take my pay

I don't mean to depress you or give you the blues
But this is what's going on in my city, (how bout you?) I'm just telling you the truth

(Extra Kool)
The dinner is naked, Benway's tube feeding puppies milkshakes 
With groupies in disguise and a mind for cheese steaks
Charlton Hesston told me that Soylent Green is people
With pink stars yellow moons and babies in steeples
The clouds rain panic and I rain on command
With teardrops, snowflakes, mobs and man
She's wears a bulletproof heart he wears a dick dastardly smile
With carnations in his teeth and a spastic style
She can't believe it's love, he can't believe it's not butter
She shows her breasts like car wrecks, making his privates flutter
But there's grey's in the room eating plates of sushi
Watching puppies play poker singing I Love Lucy
I watched the cracks sweat profusely as my mind grows thinner
Remember to check the clothing at the door and don't be late for dinner</pre>
