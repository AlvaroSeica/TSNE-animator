I said you're the one that I want
And I'll neva eva leave you alone
Neva leave you lone
Girl I won't
So I neva eva
I'll neva baby
you ain't gotta worry bout' a thing, no
you ain't gotta worry bout' a thing, no
you ain't gotta worry bout' a thing, no
I'll be right back babe
I'll be right back, Oooh

Yeah, you ain't gotta worry
Girl, Ima always hold you down like merece
I know I'll be in and out like service
But I ain't neva give you reasons to be nervous

Talkin bout' you heard this
You believe that?
Your mind's runnin' girl, I think you need to relax
I know that chu miss me
I'm tryna handle bussiness
I'm not tryna be a mistery

So why you acting like Sherlock Holmes
girl I mean it when I tell you I'll be coming back home
So don't wake up now
you be extra good without your makeup, yeah

And you can put it on my tag
And when I get there Ima put it on that ass
You can have anything you want
I swear this is more than a hunch

I said you're the one that I want
And I'll neva eva leave you alone
Neva leave you lone
Girl I won't
So I neva eva
I'll neva baby
you ain't gotta worry bout' a thing, no
you ain't gotta worry bout' a thing, no
you ain't gotta worry bout' a thing, no
I'll be right back babe
I'll be right back, Oooh

Yeah, god is my witness
I'm sure that chu don't think I could tell the difference
but believe me girl I do pay attention
And I will not compare you to any other bitches, naww

It's obvious you better
And I appreciate it
That other shit don't matter
The plan gotta go
It's accordedly
it sound like you thinkin' bout them bitches
more than me
Only thing I'm cuttin' down is the money tree
Girl we gotta stick together
hunny bee
You got the smile of a sunny D
And I'm a packrat
I won't throw it away
So before you get all fed up
Do like 2pac said, try to keep yo head up
Think about everything we've been through
Where's all the trust
I need you to adjust it

you're the one that I want
And I'll neva eva leave you alone
Neva leave you lone
Girl I won't
So I neva eva
I'll neva baby
you ain't gotta worry bout' a thing, no
you ain't gotta worry bout' a thing, no
you ain't gotta worry bout' a thing, no
I'll be right back babe
I'll be right back, Oooh</pre>
