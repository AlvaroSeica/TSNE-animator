* yes, that's actually what he said - don't correct this

	Okay we gon' set the coordinates
	for Q-Unique to travel through rhyme time travel
	Ahh, we're going to send him, 1979, 1988, and 1999

[computer voice] Nineteen, seventy-nine

[Q-Unique]
Hoooooooo! (Hooooooo!)
Say ho, ho!  (Ho, ho!)
Ah with the A to the B, the C to the D
Come on, party people get with me
Swingin, I give you what you need
and just check the rhyme as I proceed
ah with the funk, box, no dreadlocks
I keep a fade and stay well paid
The funky speakin Puerto Rican without a doubt
And suckers wanna test, you get smacked in the mouth
With the R-E-S, P-E-C-E-T *
No kid, don't you play with me
R-E-S, P-E-C-E-T *
Cause I'm rollin with the R-S-C
I'm with the Arsonists, to the Zulu Nation
To the top the destination
With unity, and elevation
Speak Q-Unique beats innovation

[computer voice] Nineteen, eighty-eight

[Q-Unique]
Arsonists, settin fires
D-Stroy, Swell Boogie, Freestyle, Jise One
Q-Unique..

The force of one, vocally sprayed by poetic machine gun
Acknowledge existance of a prodigy born son
Even the odds divide come up with the sum
and the remainder will be one
The Q-U-N-I, Q-U-E
Check the menu, for what it'll be
Steady flow more, for lyrical pop
Cause I walk talk look live breathe hip-hop
Futuristic b-boy, Rock Steady Crew
Check your Chinese calendar, it's the year of the Q
Calm, down, my pace so you can
hop all over lyrical roller coaster ride
As I, once, again, climb, slow-ly, up the track
then fall in a poetical burst of an array
of fat linguistic dispersion
So get a grip, like a velcro strap
Cause when I step up I kicks the crazy rap
Conflict is none, the rhymes outdone
Check the tactics to the force of one

[computer voice] Nineteen, ninety-nine

[Q-Unique]
Q-United, Rock Steady rhymer
Arsonist settin fire, check it
All throughout the seasonal, the epitome of hip-hop
locks mic cord to track board to spite all rap overlords
When from out the heavens street lessons 
and battle tactics from rhythm speak
Q-U and the art of studyin the 1200 Technic
Ceremonial master killer, apply the fat cap to the filler
And still and yet, you have no defense against my six step
Only thing that seperates me from the mic is space and time
And it'll be a matter of minutes before orbitin graceful lines
Search your place and find, Q-Unique way up, now first in line
Words written will radiate, hence the verse will fly in
Used to listen to Ice Cube curse a rhyme now I shine like sunrise
in the summertime, I'm like hmm, nevermind, one of a kind..
