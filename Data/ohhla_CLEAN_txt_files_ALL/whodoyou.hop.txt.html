Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro: Hopsin] + (female)
Who the fuck is this, hello?
(Hello Marcus?) Huh?
(What are you doing?)
Watchin Cops, what you doin?
(Just sittin here thinkin about my baby Harold)
(but guess what the fuck he did?)
What? (He said he was only gonna stay with me for a week Marcus)
(and he's fucking) hold on
(He's been here for like three months already what do I do?)
(I mean I don't wanna tell him to leave cause hes my boyfriend)
(Aand I love him Marcus)
Man, hey man wait, wait hey man hold on a second man
(Uhh what?)

[Hopsin]
Bitch who do you think I am?
Aiyyo, this shit has gotten out of hand
Why you callin me when you havin problems wit' ya man (huh?!)
I got enough problems as it is
Girl you talkin to the kid who don't know how to get a bitch (bitch!)
If you want me to get all mushy as a friend
Then you better give me motherfuckin pussy at the end (what?)
You makin me feel like a wussy little man
And it's worthless if I don't get the tushy in my hand (man!)
I don't want to talk for some hours every night
About the man you like. And how he'd rather fight
Than build your relationship; just face it, bitch
I don't give a fuck, fuck him, take this dick
Only reason that I even listen, is that I'm seekin admission
To put my penis on yo' freakin clitoris (Ha!)
I'm tired of it, I just want to say "God damn!"

[Chorus]
God damn bitch who do you think I am?
(My boyfriend dumped me, I'm so lonely) So?
Bitch who do you think I am?
(James always act like he don't want me!) So?
Bitch who do you think I am!
I want yo pussy! (Pussy, pussy!)
Bitch who do you think I am?
If you ain't thinkin about lettin me hit it
You need to quit it (shit) who do you think I am?!

[Hopsin]
A fuckin gay dude who listens to your stories?
If they nice or if they borin?
Girl I'm tired and I'm snorin
Cause your vibe is just annoyin
And I'm tired of ignorin and avoidin and supportin this shit
And plus I'm horny, you think I'm really into that?
Girl, put an end to that, I just want to get the snatch
Ching ching, hit the jackpot!
Bitch open up your legs like a laptop
Take a fat cock. Yeah, then I'll let your ass talk
But otherwise, if you don't, we gon' slap box
Fuck around and ride up on yo block and get yo ass popped
Wastin my time, now I'm wastin my rhymes
Makin this song? Cause you ain't got naked yet, ho?
You think I put that time in for nothing?
Fuck that, we either fighting, or fucking!
And I ain't playin wit' you girl, I'd hate to dis you
No wait, I like to dis you
Turn this shit to wilder issues

[Chorus]

[Interlude]
Marcus (what?) come pick me up (why? what happened?) he dumped me (man shoot)
He told me he doesn't love me anymore {Bitch crying}

[Hopsin]
I couldn't kick it wit' yo ass a while ago
And now you want to han cause he ain't around no mo'?
What the fuck I look like, after he fucked you?
And he dumped you? Now I'm the dude you run to?
When he wants you, I'ma be the one you flee from soon
Then I'll become the one you got your finger up to?
It ain't my motherfuckin life, you think I care?
Ha! Shiit

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

[Outro]
Like I really want to hear that shit</pre>
