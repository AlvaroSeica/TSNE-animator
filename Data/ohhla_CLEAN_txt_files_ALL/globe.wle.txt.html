[Wale]
Standing on the couches
Her man is out of towning
Have some adultery, baby
Don't you go be so childish
Not into diamonds I'm shining
Just to get geechied out
When it get too cute I say "cool"
I just let Miss Reesy know
Magic City, a staff of the fattest asses
My Black Bentley is rented, right now I'm stackin
This is my passion, I'm out
Atlanta, smashing some action
And it's not just talk, when I
Get to the box I'm dashing like Cassius
40 nights I was suffering
Bought a condo like fuck it
Like a condom that's fucked up
I'm the wrong one to fuck with
Love it, they need it, the illest young'un
To speak it, there's really something about me
That make hot emcees go anemic

[Tity Boi]
2 chains, I got 2 bitches
Watch me put it together like 2 Swishers
Got your baby mama in the new pictures
If you don't like it, hope you
Got your tool with ya!
I'm an eskimo, nigga, I got cold bars
And my bank account look just like a phone card
Have to move that bitch so far she need a postcard
Then I switched the grill on the Chevy, got a nose job
Wet lips on the rims: I call em "blow job"
If they ain't getting money tell em "go rob"
Yea I'm ballin' hard like a globetrotter
Now I got em on they toes cause my flow hotter

[Chorus: Tity Boi]
I'm balling bitch: globetrotter
If that pussy good, I tell that bitch
"Let's go shopping"
These shoes right here ain't come from Foot Locker
I give a girl what she want - but no dollars

I'm ballin bitch, you stallin bitch
3 cell phones and I still won't call a bitch
I like mine with no pork in it
Want a meal with no fork in it
[?], I ordered it
And I'm a shit where your toilet is
I hope you recorded that
Too short, I'm born to mack
Too dope, two cups, this Codeine not cognac
Come close, catch a contact
I got a loud pack in my cargo pocket
Catch your girl in my condo poppin
And ain't no way you're gonna stop it
Hard top, I'm gonna drop it
When I drop the top, she drops her ass
Pop fast then pop tags
And I'm oh so calm, smoking on a muscle bag
And I come through your [?]

[Wale]
Paper chasin, paper chasin
Emcee I'm paper chasin
Take you where you can't see
I can't see forever my lady
The envy, we on bitch
Recently they been on me
[?]
Hold up, couple rollers
Got a nouveau and some Moet
And I bet that you gon love me
I respect that you don't know yet
That Moschino shit is so back
But I'm seeing they gon snap
We don't care if a nigga's locked out
We gonna ball all year, nigga know that
Where my Lil nigga Mo at?
Southwest where a little nigga Zo at
[?]
Bunch of whores, lightning 4's
See my Jordans spark, you ain't got no Airs

[Chorus: Tity Boi]
I'm balling bitch: globetrotter
If that pussy good, I tell that bitch
"Let's go shopping"
These shoes right here ain't come from Foot Locker
I give a girl what she want - but no dollars</pre>
