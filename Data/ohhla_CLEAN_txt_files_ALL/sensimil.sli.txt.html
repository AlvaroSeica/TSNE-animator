Typed by: AZ Lyrics

But everybody wants to get some
Sensimilla
And everybody wants to get some
We want our sensimilla
And everybody wants to get some
We want the sensimilla
And everybody wants to get some
We want the sensimilla
You know that it's better
To smoke it
Said in the morning time time time
But when you wake you bake
You know that
Everything (something) will be just fine
So fine
You know that it's better
To smoke that shit
Said in the morning time
But when you wake you bake
You know that
Jah jah say you be just fine
So fine
The people said
Everybody wants to get some
They want the sensimilla
And everybody wants to get some
Give me my sensimilla
And everybody wants to get some
I want the Sensimilla
And everybody wants to get some
But then he call the doctor for me
But yes this is a case of emergency
You know we rockin' 105.3
We comin' to give the good lovin'
Like she givin' it to me
So listen the people say yeah
But everybody wants to get some
Sensimilla
And everybody wants to get some
Give me my sensimilla
And everybody wants to get some
Wont give me the sensimilla
And everybody wants to get some</pre>
