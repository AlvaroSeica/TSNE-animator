[P.O.S.]
Dragging a lake, dragging a kettlebell, nothing ever gets done
Nothing ever just makes, so much dismantle, nothing ever gets done
Never people in place, every never is now, every never is now
Find a base, hold your space like a Spartan
Never fill in the blanks, let 'em hang in the ranks, let 'em crowd up
Never cut to the chase or skip to the bullets and blaze, watch 'em get loud
Take it title to credits, every never is now, every never is now
Clear the space, let it out... okay
Chew at the trap, just a hobby, a fact, an option to counter the doubt
I'm so cozy without, watch 'em gather what's haunted and shove in they mouth
See the trouble is humble is over and modesty suffers it out
Honesty tougher than tissue is now, leather is gone with the horse and the plow
Never better when better won't do, bet on that, they gon' pedal the cure
Coca Cola gave how much to who? Words subvert subdue, let 'em sell it to you
You, you, nothing's better than aiming at nothing and hitting your mark
Everyone's famous, now we can just sit in the dark, and wait
Dragging a lake, dragging a kettlebell, nothing ever gets done ay
So quick with the take, so quick with the show and tell, everybody is number one
Never nothing for you huh? Every never is now
Take two and call when you need a few more, you can beat at they door
They don't sleep, they don't need it
Killing the shakes, keeping the spins huh, nothing ever gets done
So carried away, now carry the burden, nothing ever gets done
Never no one for you huh? Every never is now (every never is now)
Every never is now, every never is now (every never is now)
Dragging a lake, keeping the cool clothes, nothing ever gets done
Skipping the change, keeping the fools gold
Everybody's so shiny and new, new, new, look at you
You got so much to show for the work you put in, look at you, you
You stay helping yourself fill up on the bread, that's how they get you

[Judah Nagler]
I'll be the ground... nobody gets me down...
I'll be the bridge... I'll fall from the highest ledge

[P.O.S.]
Rubbed so raw, so wrong, so vigorous
Twist that bleed, that venom, get rid of it all
Every never is now {*4X*}
Don't sweat nothing, don't mention it
Don't wait, anything but forward is a waste of time
Every never is now {*6X*}

[Judah Nagler]
I'll be the ground, nobody gets me down living in the crowd
I'll be the bridge, fall from the highest ledge, sleeping in the ditch
I'll be the ground, nobody gets me down living in the crowd
I'll be the bridge, fall from the highest ledge, sleeping in the ditch</pre>
