[Intro/Chorus One: Nicki Minaj]
Oh-oh-ohhhh! Come fill my glass up a little more
We 'bout to get up and burn this floor
You know we gettin hotter and hotter
Sexy and hotter, let's shut it down

[Nicki Minaj]
Unnngh
Yo~! What I gotta do to show these girls that I own 'em?
Some call me Nicki, and some call me Roman
Skeezer, please, I'm in Ibiza
Whoa! Giuseppe Zanotti, my own sneaker
Sexy, sexy, that's all I do
If you need a bad bitch let me call a few
Cum somewhere in the middle, mini-skirts is out
I see some good girls, I'ma turn 'em out
Okay bottle, sip, bottle, guzzle
I'm a bad bitch, no muzzle, AYYY?!
Bottle, sip, bottle, guzzle
I'm a bad bitch, no muzzle, let's go!

{Music, makes me... high}

[Chorus One]

[Chorus Two: Nicki Minaj]
Pound the alarm!
Pound the alarm!

[Nicki Minaj]
I wanna do it for the night, night
So get me now, and knock this over
I wanna do it like you like, like
Come get me baby; we're not gettin younger
I just want you tonight-night
Baby we won't do it for life-life

{Music, makes me... high}

[Chorus One] + [Chorus Two]
