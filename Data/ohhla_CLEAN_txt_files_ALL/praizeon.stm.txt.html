[Chorus]
Party people in the place to be
If you feel like getting down in this place with me
Wave your hands in the air from left to right and
Scream and shout...oh yeah
If you're really got a feeling tonight
And if you got a problem it'll be all right
You just gotta get your praise on here tonight
And scream and shout praise on

[Verse 1]
Are you ready for a bomb beat coming to you
from the streets of Los Angeles bringing the truth
too smooth for the roughest thug up in the hood
got the beats to make you bounce keep you all feeling good
introducing new sounds from that kat Mr. Smooth
get in the groove get your praise on let the spirit move
get your hand raise on it's amazing when it lays on
track plays on just to help you stay strong
getting down for the father reason why I'm here
it's crystal clear like Jackie V so have no fear
what you heard for years is true the end is near
it's time to put away the drugs and drop the beer
I came to rock mics delivering the messages
it's not a test it's just word from the messenger
all you gotta do is get down so listen to the sound
now throw your hands up and get your praise on

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Get you praise on, Get you praise on
Get you ride on, Get you ride on
Get you praise on, Get you praise on
Get you ride on, Get you ride on
Something new for you to bump to city to city
hooked up the track with MPC and the midi
now I'm ready to initiate an all out war
on the deceiver so believer hope your ready for sure
gather round the holy throne of the lord with me
jump inside take a ride come roll with me
to the land of the man with no disease
got you talking while I'm walking on golden streets
in the middle of the storm that's when the test comes
things get warm if you're a blessed one
all you gotta do is get down so listen to the sound
now throw your hands up and get your praise on

[Chorus]</pre>
