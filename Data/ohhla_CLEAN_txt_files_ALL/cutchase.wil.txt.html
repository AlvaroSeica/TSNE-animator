You got the time, but lady I got the place (place)
Just cut to chase (uh huh)

[First Verse]
I'm in the club (club)
Poppin bottles, man its been on since I threw up (up)
Fellas, ladies, babies, TA just show me love (love)
This for my people who knew I wasn't givin up (uh huh)
Ain't giving up (uh huh)
And for my ladies (ladies)

Yeah you look good, but momma how you tryin to play me
(play me)
I ain't gonna sweat you boo it's on to the next lady

[Chorus x2]

[Second Verse]
Next spot (spot)
Same story, women bouncing and getting hot (hot)
All up on my jock, but I cant stop
So I just drop a hundred dollars on the bar
Not thinking, got a bottle of Corona
So all my niggas start drinkin!
Now it's on (on)
Bet they all think somebody's chicken comin home

Pretty Willie ain't never goin home alone ('lone)
And it's a shame because they know
There's one thing or two that a brother can do is try
his best to keep shows

All you fake ass players I despise ('spise)
