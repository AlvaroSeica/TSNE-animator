[Ras Ceylon]
40 years ago April 21st the date Jamaica is the place
thousands waiting for a plane in the pouring rain 
looking towards the sky the earth shook froze time 7 doves out the sky
bring sunshine Sellasie I has arrived and the people cried 
JAH Rastafari, bredrin licking chalice right under the flight
babylon leaves the site, ini unite, its that groundation day
king of kings steps alite to the door of the chariot 
waiving to the massive/ Mortimo Planno tells the crowd to relax
let His Majesty pass Red Gold and Green flag
waves on taken land blessed by his ancient plan
just then a sistren named Rita saw it
the mark of the christ stigmata they call it
she told her man Bob that His Majesty is God
later that day Jah gave the elders a nod
held a reasoning session and blessed them with a lesson
said Liberate yourselves then in Zion you step in 
he said liberation here, in Zion you step in 

[CHORUS - Empress Tashai]
a long time we go warn dem, Rasta said we have to tell them
a long time we go warn dem, Ras Ceylon come fi tell them
a long time we go warn dem and dem never wan listen
don't diss the man who give you the blessing
a long time we tell them and them never wan hear
dis Sellasie I that are your worst nightmare

[Ras Ceylon]
I'm a true and living Rastaman so what you say
bout the works of the father each and everyday
the knowlege of Jah takes you out a mental grave
cuz his majesty brought the people a better way
while the heathen rage and imagine in vain
that prophecy is over and revelations never came
but you can't explain what sustains jah flame
and why some people tremble when I say this name
Haile Sellasie the first on earth
rightfully ruling see them dreads on the turf
for what its worth we putting in Rasta work
shepherds of the flock on the block the youth search
for guidance denied it, get criminalized and silenced
violence provided by their whole environment 
thats why we're sent knowledge cipher like ten
freedom first then repatriation

[CHORUS - Empress Tashai]
a long time we go warn dem, Rasta said we have to tell them
a long time we go warn dem, Ras Ceylon come fi tell them
a long time we go warn dem and dem never wan listen
don't diss the man who give you the blessing
a long time we tell them and them never want hear
dis Sellasie I that are your worst nightmare

[Ras Ceylon]
yo this ones the anthem sound of the champion
I rep ras youths and slew every dragon
them crews are bragging I burn their bandwagons
with overstanding the lions on my flag when
I step in a the place its a ital space landing on my feet shining
tanning the face of you weakhearts see sparks of fire in the eye
nyahbinghi where all oppression dies
yes i the dred i with the force like a Jedi
gideon course Sellasie source of the fight
the king died no thats a god damn lie
he liveth and reigneth in the flesh of ini
Rastafari forever right Jah Guide
I-man got love for all of my tribe thats worldwide
heard i recognize collective I
livity defined is how we live this life
keep the concious mind no matter how they backbite
stay on the narrow path no jackknife
act rite nice vibes straight everytime
give thanks and praise to His Majesty for the rhyme

[Ras Ceylon]
