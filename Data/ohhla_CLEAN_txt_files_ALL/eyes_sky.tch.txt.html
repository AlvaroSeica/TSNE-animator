Album:  The Martyr
Song:   Eyes in the Sky
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Chorus: Alan Parsons Project sung by Mojo]
I am the eye in the sky
Looking at you, I can read your mind
I am the maker of rules
Dealing with fools, I can cheat you blind

[Immortal Technique]
Yeah~! My truth is the Ark of the Covenant, buried in Ethiopia
Watch who you fuckin with, a Minneapolis Somalian
When I go home the world I used to know is gone
and now I live on my own, for which shall it profit
A rapper with creative control
to sign a deal with the Devil and, lose his soul
My stillborn first expression is cold like the faces of slave masters
On the paper I fold, subliminal racial supremacy
Chokin me quick, like the bedtime stories, of Joseph Smith
Lynch mob gunnin for me, tryin to murder my seeds
So shorty put him in the Nile, in a basket of reeds
And now I stare into the future with a spiritual flashlight
Wonderin, who the fuck was me in the past life?
Bad diet, fuck law, die young, fast life
Same as the crashed flight, that took off
when +the music died+ on your last night
Tell 'em the truth, and they call you a traitor
Talk to 'em honestly, and they call you a hater
Losing my composure, cause the message is urgent
Talkin reckless, drunk on the mic like Larry Merchant
Cursin at the serpents, Sumerian demons who
brush their wings against the air that I'm breathin
A heathen with nothin left to believe in, even a reason for living
that was forgiven, by God and not religion
Envision Jesus risen from the dead like Horus
In a Baptist church, shakin off the rigor mortis
The borders should be illegal instead of the people
that were here before the Bible and all of its sequels
I speak to the detached and unrealistic
That were born normal but turned socially autistic
We resisted Homeland Security's mission
because I know what they really envision

[Chorus] - repeat 2X to fade</pre>
