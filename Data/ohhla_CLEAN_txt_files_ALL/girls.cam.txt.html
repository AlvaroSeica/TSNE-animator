Girls just wanna have fun

[Verse 1]
Damn chump pass, he a dumb ass

Cause she cum fast skeet skeet nigga
We be wit her, me, jim. zee, hit her
Then she wit flea flicker, don gg get her
P.e wit her, wee wee, eazy, ol me, ol g little me lick her
So she need liquor never seem sicker, nigga,if rap was head
She could be twista
Had her alley to alley, hawai and mawi, and cali to bali
Up in white lotus dog you might notice
That you type bogus me I'm quite focus
And hope is hopeless, dissapaer in the air hocus pocus

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Godamn stuck like stuck-o
Cut low slut no here he come uh oh (uh oh)
Man see what the fighting do thats why I'm piping boo
Aint even liking you, I'm exciting true
Just right I do, heals high, wheels fly, real fly nikes on you(air 1's)
And a rightous view, from night to new, day, hey play
Catch a flight for two (first class!) and you hawk you a baller. baller!
Hawker, dog you a stalker! (your a stalker)
Upset cause what she was showin, awww man you ain't in gear for knowin
Ask question in fear of hoe-in
Whatz that?, who you wit?, where you at?, where you goin?, (where you goin)
Where you goin, I'm flowin, she blowin, sky high like a bowin
Got pies like it snowin

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Females better twirl on yours, better curl on yours
Cause I swirl on shores (then what) come back to a pearl golf porche (who you)
I'm Kurupt, cause "Girls All Pause"
and the world is yours, honey sip sizzurp earl of course
And you know I'm in the buildin mister
Wit the Olsen twins, or the Hilton sisters
And I haul 'em in to the hiltons mister
I milked them, I killed them, you quilt them, you missed her (missed her)
You helped her, you kissed her
You felt all the blisters, melt on your whiskers

[Chorus] - 2X</pre>
