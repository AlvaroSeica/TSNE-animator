[Verse One: Ice-T]
I'm rolling up in a big gray bus
And I'm shackled down, myself that's who I trust
The minute I arrived, some sucker got hit
Shanked ten times behind some bullshit
Word in the pen, the fool was a snitch
So without hesitating, I made a weapon quick
Found a sharp piece of metal, taped it to a stick
Then a bullhorn sounds, that means it's time for chow
My first prison meal, the whole feeling was foul
It wasn't quite my style, but my stomach growled
So I flushed the shit down and hit the weight pile
The brothers was swole, the attitudes was cold
Felt the tension on the yard, from the young and the old
But I'm a warrior, I got my ground to hold
So I studied the inmates, to see who had the power
The Whites? The Blacks? or just the gun tower!

[Inmate #1: Sean E Sean]
Yo man, I was at the gang's town man
On the door ?? on a great pile man
And these two fools was fighting with white boys, man
The white boy threw them all through the window, man
And back them ?? was like hanging out man
The COG don't wanna touch them, man
It's like blood everywhere
But I figured I just can't be stick that well in this commissary, man
It was Real bad man, it was Real crazy up there man, it was wild!

[Verse Two: Ice-T]
In a blink of an eye, a riot broke out
Blacks put their backs to the wall, cause it was north and south
A gun man shouts and everybody had doubts
Until the bullets started flying, took two men out
Then they rushed everybody back to their cells
Damn! the pen is different from the county jail
I'm in a one man cell, I know my life's on a scale
I wonder if that gunman is going to hell
This is my second day, I got a ten year stay
I learned my first lesson in the pen; there's no play
I've seen a brother killed another cause they said he was gay
But that's the way it is, it been that way for years
When his body hit the ground, I heard a couple of cheers
It kind of hurt me inside, they were glad he died
And I ask myself, just who had the power?
The Whites? the Blacks? or just the gun tower!

[Inmate #2: Mello]
In Solidad, XL the first day of the RTQ
Some passed through the petal Detectors
I can feel their attitude is so thick, I can touch it
The manpower was all around, I can definitely see that
Before I know it, three stickers are went
Yeah, few cats get, locked down

[Verse Three: Ice-T]
You see, the Whites got a thing they call White pride
The Blacks got the muscle, Mexicans got the knives
You better be wise, you wanna stay alive
Go toe to toe with a sucker, no matter what size
A fool tried to sweat me, acting like he was hard
I stuck him twice in the neck, and left him dead in the yard
It was smooth how I did it, cause nobody could see
With my jacket on my arm and my knife on the side of me
Bam bam, it was over, another fools bites the dust
I went crazy in the pen with nobody to trust
I'm benching ten quarters, so I'm hard to sweat
Used a tat gun, and engraved my set
They call me a lifer cause I'm good as dead
I live in the hole, so the floor is my bed
And I ask myself again who has the power
The Whites? The Blacks? or just the gun tower

[Inmate #3: Al Patrome]
Damn! man, it's getting too overflow
Back up here, you know, Charles Mason or any dead killer
You know, on the main line, you know what I'm saying?
Them white boys getting stuck on the regular
Getting their commissary took, you know what I'm saying?
Then I go from there to sue this world
You know, I made me some steel, you know what I'm saying?
Had me get busy with it, if you know what I'm saying?
Had to get busy, you know, got pushed to the whole
Laid dead, and I had defined myself, you know what I'm saying?
When I was able to get back to the.. mainline, you know what I'm saying?
There was drama once again, you know, they were ready to move on me
Ready to roll me up off the yard, you know
But my God is with me, you know what I'm saying?
John Nail, Nilson, you know what I'm saying?
OGs, was down on my line, you know what I'm saying?
Ready to get busy, put they life on the line and stick something for me
Then they rolled us up, you know, put us back in a solitary
Moved us from there to the other yard
Where was more drama, and the Warning Shot was a hit</pre>
