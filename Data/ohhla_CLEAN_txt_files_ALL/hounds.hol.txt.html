[Holocaust]
The kind of bird eats insects, fruits and nuts
Sailing through the portal will bring them to safety, before the planet erupts
The hounds of hell and vampires everywhere, through there
That is the way in, there are rumors of despair
Beware, I stab you in the naval, with my Colonial pen
In the end and snare, Zoon and Pueblo Indians respect many thieves
Horses with dark hair, in the 1500's of Spain, but I was already deceased
We've been aware, of vampire activity
In this town, for quite some time, the walking hills
I ride lonesome, the ghost watch, that I drink
Dual wielded guns, in the snowy woods, a ski hunter
You become a war casualty
Back to the portals, controls, he could get it to open
To another place in the galaxy
Life and death decisions, the golden rings
I vanish like leaning gardens, Stephen King's needful things
The broken land, one more train to rob scene
Decision is so down, I use machines

[Chorus: Dopestyle]
Say, welcome to the frontier, hounds on our trail
By the gun, live and die, shooting out, fuck jail
Shoot it out, fly O'Neal, straight in your coffin
Slugs of peyote, run wild with coyote
Welcome to the frontier, hounds on our trail
By the gun, live and die, shooting out, fuck jail

[Holocaust]
Around the world from eighty graves, an animated corpse in the cave
One up butterflies lay their eggs on a plant called milkweed
They could fly at speeds, of up to eighty miles per hour
And as high as three thousand feet
They could fly as far as north as Canada
And could travel up to three thousand miles, in the cave with
Me, a gun I smile, the art of revenge
Live or dead, it's your choice, friend
There is an extraordinary legend, a place something
Was burning slowly, relentlessly, the forest is returning
You ask why are you guys standing the dark?
I blow you apart from lead
The lyrics in Canal shall often fill with corpses of the dead
Pretty like salamanders in news today, ain't your lucky day, friend
A dark MacGuyver, nobody knows how many people
Were killed by the tiger, you arch the desert
The year of the cocktail forever, in the ocean
There are decorator crab, chemicals posted
On oil drums, fag
If you were a, snake charmer, you'd be dead by now
It's time for some fighting, as Robot Tank
Change, God damn, to battle mode, kapow!

[Dopestyle]
So, who pow, who bang? Nigga on the chain gang
In my vein, power juice, like Mr. Bane
The Batman, eighteen, six to one, man
Rob your bank, Jesse James is my name
Indian Zoo broke me free, Desmond Wolfe, see I flee
Came across the wagon, with the family
Shut the father, took the food and the horse
The wife, daughter came back, bit me, they wolves
Killed my good friend, a nigga lone ranger
Turned on vampires, I come as a stranger
Searched for the gold, gun powder in the mail, son
Fire on the crips, turn to a wolf and
Guess I'm still looking, with my crossbow
Blazing son, a werewolf, Mr. Atopo, hah </pre>
