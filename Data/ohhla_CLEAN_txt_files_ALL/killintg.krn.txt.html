South Park, Dead End
Let's get em, let's get em
5th Ward, 4-4
Let's get em, let's get em
Southeast, Southwest
Let's get em, let's get em
3rd Ward, Hiram-Clarke
Let's get em, let's get em

Question, how did this develop
My car my swagger my chain, shut the hell up
The one you got, ain't even yours
I seen you at the grocery store, mopping the floors
You telling lies, by the dozen
Boy you ain't no pimp, one of your dancers is your cousin
Said you was balling, but you wasn't
I ain't never seen your wife, you probably got a husband
Your last album, was garbage
I listened to it once, it gave my stereo a virus
Seventeen songs, every one wack
I wouldn't sign you, to an imaginary contract
Let me quit playing, and be for real
You could pay me a mill, like you was giving me a deal
Watch your career plummet
You could win nintey straight, and still be ninety under .500
 
[Hook - 2x]
All these toilet paper emcees, is killing the game
Sugar water drinking fly cats, killing the game
They wanna knock us out the picture, but we still in the frame
Slap a hater in the grill, if you feeling the same
 
[K-Rino]
Look at how this fool is dancing, oh Lord
I can't even say this line right, I'm laughing so hard
Your so called hits, you the only one who quote em
You got fan letters, but you the one who wrote em
They say K you should make a dance song, it might bubble
So I made me one up, it's called the beat your ass shuffle
Some of y'all, are full of estregen
Manhood in the negative, y'all are less than men
Octogon match, un-refereed
Bludging you, you gon' need somebody to help you bleed
The way you rappers turned the game, into a fly fad
It's like some dude blowing up a school, and saying my bad
And sagging, is so controversial
The hood looking like, a damn underwear commercial
And if it ain't one scam, it's another
Now they photoshopping models, on they mixtape cover man

Let me take you back to childhood, for one minute now think
See boys use to wear blue, and girls wore pink
Mohawks use to be hard, (like Mr. T?) certainly
Now dudes be getting mohawks, and coloring them burgundy
At school you had curls, and pretty shirts with swirls
While we was shooting hoops, you played jacks with the girls
Little boys shouldn't put on womens clothing, and you know it
Hey take this football boy, go outside and throw it
Catch it, run jump kick throw a javelin
Steal a car or start a fight, do something that's masculine
Years later you picked up the mic, uh-oh what's happening
I won't make no more songs like this, just promise not to rap again
It's impossible, to wear pink thuggishly
Don't be surprised, if rappers start rocking pumps publically
I'm born, with the characteristics of a G
But I can't look at this girl, because this dyke is mean mugging me
