[Intro: Bushwick Bill]
Haha ha ha hha ha, awww shit, is it time?
Alright, here's when we're all come together 
To discuss, to do time, within ourselves 
When we're all wanna do something extraordinary 
Which is to kill, a thought, a person, or a situation
Ha ha ha hha haha
But because two motherfuckers can't agree on one issue;
that creates the means, for shit to come to an end
So therefore, it's either you gonna do it my way 
Or you gonna die fucking with us
So this is war, my weapons is aimed to reach you
Rap-A-Lot Mafia for life nigga
I can feel you

[Verse One: N.A.R.D]
Now, how can I introduce you to this pain?
With the slugs to the brain
Beyond this bitch, to go push-up with some bangs
With an anchor called point blank range
Split the world with game
Rotate with niggaz that will not change
In this world we blame for everything from straps to cocaine
Individual, kind of attack 
back tracks with stuff like Macks with profiles
Any threat, so disrespect it to get you shot with Four Five
Rap-A-Lot Mafia, the incredible sources and forces 
Of course it's verbally said, no remorses
Physical contact, take your choices
Nevertheless, I want this bitch with a bum to the chest
Two techs in the vest, put it in you
Make your body like slugs in a venue
