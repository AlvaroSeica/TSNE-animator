[Future]
Whippin' the yam, whippin and flippin' the yam, turn the whole brick to a Lam (SKRRT~!)
Been rockin' the dope, soon as it get off the boat (yeah); keepin' it soft like a mink (yeah)
Gold on my link (link) coke in the sink (sink) choppin' that work like karate (woo!)
Serve in the new Maserati (SKRRT~!) in a brand new Maserati (woo!)
That's a whole lot of new money (money) snatch it, then hide it from 12
Movin' and squashin' them bells, servin' the rawest of yayo
Beatin' that china like Kunta Kinte (woo!) whippin' it, whippin' that fish and Parkay (woo!)
Drinkin' on syrup, I'm rollin' up haze (turn up) made myself a boss, a boss or a plug (turn up)
Either way you put it, nigga, I'm good (turn up) triple salute, nigga, straight out the hood (turn up)
Bakin' soda water splash the scales (scales) fork in my right and my pot in my left (left)
Leanin' over, over to the side (whip) I whip me a four way to a nine (whip)
The dirty, the money is homicide (woo!) and my recipe can't be televised (yeah)

[Chorus]

[Pusha T]
WOO! WOO! WOO! King Push
Young enough to still sell dope, but old enough that I knows better
When they sayin' it's 42 for that white powder, I knows/nose better
Get it nigga? I nose better, put a smile on the devil's face
Who don't wanna sell dope forever and flood their Rollie 'til the bezel break?
WOO! Fish scale in the two-door that I fish-tail
Fiberglass, Ferrari leather, in designer shit that I misspell
YAH! Look at the clues, the J's, the jewels, I mention the monkey
From sixteen years old, I'm whippin' in kitchens, fuckin' my junkies
Pablo, +Versace+ way before Migos
My dinner plates, no silverware, all you niggas my E-hoes
Toss a kilo like a free throw, crack house, it had the peephole
Made it through to the other side, now nothin's big as my ego
Push, WOO! HAHA~! HAHAHA~!!

[Chorus]

[Pharrell]
Yeah, let me him 'em
Me, I try to leave the best for later, but Pusha tried to put me on the respirator
The old Skateboard P, that's your favorite; me and twenty girls doin' yoga naked
Frequency high, like a spaceship, she say that she like it and she's been exposed
The Gandalf hat and the weird ass clothes, that's Comme des GarÃ§ons and the Buffalo (yeah)
I know guerrillas with the triggers that's on a banana clip and packin' with the biggest missiles
These niggas is knockin' over vehicles; these niggas ain't waitin' just to see niggas
These niggas ain't tryna hear plea niggas; these niggas like choppin' down trees, niggas
These niggas 1-2-3 and they squeeze, niggas; these niggas hit the weed then they leave niggas - gee, nigga
If you got two hoes, you need to let one go; two Lambos, you need to let one go
All these drones while y'all smoke dro; never +Honest+ guy, I'm tryna let y'all know
Ain't no standards, I'ma set one though, big ass bag but no man sandals
All that war, we need to let that go, that boom business, I'ma get that ho

[Chorus]

[Casino]
CASINO!
Young nigga got that coke, whip that dope, like a bat-ter (whip)
How you think about that coupe, with no roof? Young nigga cashed, out (fix)
Pass me the purp, pass me the zan (yeah) young nigga 'bout to pass, out (geeked)
12 jump from behind her, I got some in the car, young nigga 'bout to smash, out (ERRT~!)
Migo hit that line, say he got some bricks, young fresh, 'bout to buy 'em out (okay)
QuikTrip 'round the corner, dropped a nine, got the J's in the hood tryna smoke a line (smoke)
Cocaine, cocaine cowboy, like Mickey Munday (MICKEY)
Take over the project, whip a line, me no wait
I keep a .45 in my coat, while I'm servin' dope (dope)
J's in my hood smoke that crack, say it give 'em hope (hope)
Serve a nigga whole brick, he hopin' that it come and go (GODDAMN!)
Young nigga tricked up, now he spendin' that money with CASINO~!!

[Chorus]

[Future]
Ahhh, push it; ahhh, push it</pre>
