[Verse 1]
Let me take a good look ma one mo' time
You dealin with some niggaz thats destined to shine
And they call me Messy, I does the most
Me and Lucc rock shows from coast to coast
Tell all ya friends they could meet my folks
We could hook up later, eat some breakfast and smoke
She couldn't keep her eyes off my colorful charm
Ask me bout the tattoos on my arm
Yeah, Click Clack Gang, you see the ice on the chain
You see me sittin in a nickel, with the blew out brain
You know I wanna get in that pussy and do a few things
Talk to me love, let me know a few things

[Hook]
Sit back and relax love, you ridin with a G
At any givin time you could be ridin with a key (say that again)
That Remi and that Crys', I really toast
Ain't no pounds of the Coupe, it's silly toast (say that again)
The '06 Jeezy and Christina Milian
Just, follow my lead we gon get a mil-li-on (say that again)
My black, my white and my spanish mami's
Body only touch Gabana or Goberto Cavali (say that again)

[Verse 2]
Let me take a good look ma one mo' time
I sho' wouldn't mind fuckin that from behind
Just tell me how you want it, I can do that fo' ya
I could slow that down and chop and screw that fo' ya
She laugh, but I couldn't let her pass
I don't see how she could walk with all that ass
I was tryin to help but get it back to the spot
Love pretty please with the cherries on top
I'm smellin like a bottle of that good Sean Combs
She was only twenty but the bitch look grown
She know I wanna do a few things
Talk to me love, let me know a few things

[Hook]

(*Talking*)
I'm just sayin, you want me to say that one mo time to you
baby, Click Clack Gang man, hold on, man
You ain't got to run off and shit, man, it's good
I'm just sayin, I'm just tryin to help you carry all that
to where you goin, it's good
Holla at your boy, man
Oh you gon do me like that
You gon do me like that, bitch (say that again)
