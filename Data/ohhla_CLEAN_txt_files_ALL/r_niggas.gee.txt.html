[B.G.]
You know Gizzle on fire, the hottest around
I layed low a minute, niggas try to count me out
Thought I was through cooked, just gone with the wind
Thought you could stick a fork in me, better think again
Man I'm here to stay, nigga I'm built to last
Chopper City in this bitch, there's no realer than that
Now where my killas at, my drug dealas at
I mean my motherfucking, get it how you livers at
Now where my bitches at, my street bitches at
My lap dancing, drop it like it's hot bitches at
You know I'm loving them, ooh when I'm fucking them
I get all up in them, bust a nut all up in them
Niggas are kissing them, I shake my head at them
They just don't know, I done shot all kind of lead in them
Yeah give me them grits, I put this butter in em
Stir em up, that yellow color in em

[Hook - 2x]

You know we bout it nigga, we the murder capital
Fo' hundred 21, that was in '94

See bout eleven of em, I done done it myself
There's one left in a dozen mo', I got under my belt
I tote them handguns, but I love them K's and shit
Them rifles with drums nigga, and banana clips
I'm off the block nigga, and it's flooded with thugs
It's hot with them people, and believe infested with drugs
Dope, coke and weed, extasy MV's
We got it all nigga, whatever you want or think you need
I'm a young dog, nigga I stand tall
My back against the wall, I'ma ball till I fall
Nigga keep it real, that's a street law
And never tell what you heard, or what you seen or saw

[Hook - 2x]
