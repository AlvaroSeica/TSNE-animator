Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Intro: news footage]
Houston police say that the CIA and the FBI both say that
Carnaby never worked for either agency
But his family tells a very different story
Saying the 52 year old spent about 30 years, serving his country

[Ill Bill]
Yo, yo, aiyyo the pilot had his gun drawn; like when the shoe bomber 
Richard Reid bit that stewardess' thumb off, you done for
When you die you go to heaven 'til then welcome to hellspawn
Celtic Frost at the Felt Forum, I'm never wrong
Stop acting tough, small criminals can steal
more money with laptops than with a mask or a gun
Intelligent relevant heretic elegant terrorist
Presentin death sentences with malevolent eloquence
Label you larger than hajj and spark a jihad
Adolescent martyrs in malls dishonor their bombs
While the lords of war pardon their arms
Concentration broken by the sound of fighter jets barkin at God
Gat shooters they snatch AK's and chains, my shooters they snatch planes
and cause international mayhem
In the mountains of Caucasia caught four Pagans in an orgy
With Lord Satan onward the war races

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
I'm surrounded by hatred and lust, angels and dust, cocaine and sluts
Dangerous thugs blaze you with guns, lace you with drugs
Murderous cyborgs disguised as blind men with guide dogs
Design wars, it's the final call

[Vinnie Paz]
Phony money and economics, that's the shit predicted by the prophets
Black guns, +Black Helicopters+
What is the connection between Jesus and the Shriners?
What is the question to the virus, and Osirus?
That's why the gun is always on the hip
I learned to never sleep on devil and to come equipped
I don't never speak on nothin always button-lipped
Whether it's why the sun exists or if it's run your shit (*BRRAP BRRAP BRRAP*)
Y'all are devilish and Vinnie move with God power
I called Bill, told him meet me at the God Hour
It's never been a question whether or not I'm star power
The only question is whether or not the God's sour
Yeah, in other words sick of the Amorite
Reverend Dr. Malachi Z. York had it right
Dealin with sound right reasonin and actin right
Teachin people how to handle ratchets and a hatchet right

[Chorus]</pre>
