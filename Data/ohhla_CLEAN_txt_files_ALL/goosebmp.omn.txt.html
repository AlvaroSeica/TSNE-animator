so sexy
come closer to me, come close but
closer
your so sexy, come closer to me
come close but

picture life on the dock of the bay, malibu nights
watching the tide washing away, chocolate thai and coronas
caribbean groves, lost in my hammock reading the news
I'm lovin' the view, don't you see I wrote it for you
I'll take you there amer morou let me share with you
close your eyes and buckle up cause we'll be there in a few
cruzin', its just me and my music, rollin sativa
deep in your cosmos's, cocking your knees up
our hearts beat like congas, I get the job done
always use precaution, i've never lost one
and your garden, your peanut butter colored skin got me starving
perfect gentleman, I beg my pardon
but
closer, you're so sexy
come closer to me
come close but

what you mean but, I think you need to ease up and recognize a good thing before it leaves ya
so sexy
come closer to me
come close but
I don't need ya, I won't stress to keep ya
but do you have a number where I could reach ya
so sexy
come closer to me
come close but
midnights on the coast, overlooking the ocean
wild fantasies, it took the man in me to get you open
conversations deeper than most, your one of a kind
I can tell your interested by the look in your eye
open up your thighs, get on the ride
reach for the sky
I'm on top of the world with all the things that money can't buy
as you and I shine bright like the fourth of july
how could it be true, I never knew love at first sight
no time to hesitate c'mon lets set a date
we can get away and catch the next flight out of state
the sex could be great, we can chill the rest of the day
or dance the night away on the beach caressing your face
closer
your so sexy
come closer to me
come close but
what you mean but, I think you need to ease up and recognize a good thing before it leaves ya
so sexy
come closer to me
come close but
I don't need ya, I won't stress to keep ya
but do you have a number where I can reach ya
so sexy
come closer to me
come close but
what you mean but, I think you need to ease up and recognize a good thing before it leaves ya
really
I don't need ya, I won't stress to keep ya
but do you have a number where I can reach ya

you won't believe the things that I can teach ya, son of a preacher
I never disrespect you or mistreat ya
you cracked a smile when I said you shouldn't be shy
so humble, so down to earth
don't even know that your fly
I never ask why, call before I pass by
we were meant to be together, this is for the last time
you don't know what you mean to me, you don't know what you mean to me
closer
so sexy
come closer to me, come close but
what you mean but, I think you need to ease up and recognize a good thing before it leaves ya
so sexy
come closer to me, come close but
I don't need ya, I won't stress to keep ya
but do you have a number where I can reach ya
so sexy
come closer to me, come close but
