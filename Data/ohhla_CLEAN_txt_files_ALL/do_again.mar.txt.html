[Kendrick Lamar]
Every day I try to escape, the realities of this world
So I tell a disc jockey press play, while I press up on a girl
In the midst of the smoke in the air, the reflection of lights that glare
She'll be out of control like a hydroplane in plain sight, I might have to stare
And that's power steering, a power trip you see in my appearance
A pile of hundreds, all on a prowl like vampires in a darkest dungeon
Speakers bumping, drinks is pouring, we in the house, we paid the mortgage
Tyrannosaurus, that's real big, pop my collar, pop that lid, uh

[Chorus: Terrace Martin]
Flashing lights, model types, vixens show me much love
Put the bottles on that ice, drink like we supposed to
Fire burning, heads is turning, all I see is energy
So eventually, we'll do this till the sun come up, the sun
We'll do this till the sun come up, the sun
Smoke like this till the sun come up, the sun
We'll do this till the moon is dropping, daybreak watching
Then do it again

[Wiz Khalifa]
Some people stay home and sleep, me? I go out at night
All seven days of the week, I live the party life
I got my dogs with me, you can bring some of your friends
We going hard till the sun come up and do it again
I got a drink in my hand, they playing my favorite song
This girl that's dancing on me ain't got no panties on
And she gon' come back to my hotel, don't tell
anyone about us, said I'm here to party all night

[Chorus]

[Wiz Khalifa]
Come to my section (to my section), and down some of this liquor (liquor)
Then tell me what it hit for (hit for)
Gon' be some things I don't remember ('member)
So take some camera phone pictures

[Kendrick Lamar]
Come to my section (to my section), and down some of this liquor (liquor)
Then tell me what it hit for (hit for)
Gon' be some things I don't remember ('member)
So take some camera phone pictures

[Chorus]</pre>
