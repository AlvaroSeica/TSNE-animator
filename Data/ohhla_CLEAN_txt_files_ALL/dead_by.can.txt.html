[Intro: Professor Griff]
Canibus, throwin melinated, molotov, cocktails
Engineered, directly out of Full Sail
Rippin the Jacker, ain't nobody nastier
Spittin and grabbin facts and data, to enhance ya
Suspense thriller
Canibus the lyrical adjective killer

[Canibus]
My Melatonin Magik is enhanced by the melatonin tablets
Come take a walk with Canibus
Ardipithecus Ramidus, what the fuck is Melatonin Magik 'Bis?
I still ain't understandin this shit
Okay, my brain is a microchip
My two balls with a cane is a macro-dick, I rap so sick
I created swine flu out of an infinite mix
You tried to diss but can't even spit, you just stand there and wish
wit'cha hand on your hips, man you a bitch
Who the fuck is you to criticize a lyrical king?
You see, that's my problem, I spit a thousand bars y'all was silent
I ain't heard nothin about it
I had to give you three years to recognize
And then I realized, can't nobody even fuck with my rhymes
The internet, is a early telepathic building set
My lyrics are international nuclear missile threats
The blogosphere is where you vent frustration and discontent
But children don't understand the concept of consequence
So yes, it's immature to express disrespect
But no I will not accept, what the media says
They are the reason we are bein mislead
There are forces above them that feed off our stress sufferin and debt
I am dead by design, cause nobody tells me what to rhyme
I make up my own fuckin mind
There are more of us than them
But at the same time they are Gods, and we are just mortal men
Thirteen levels above 33, let me say it again
They are Gods, we are just mortal men
I cannot imagine they power
They put a black family in the White House, just so they can take away ours
You tryin to plan the great escape? You a coward
They gon' make us march in a gas chamber make us think we takin a shower
Mommas and babies is cryin
The children of Zion belong to SkyNet, nobody knows who's behind it
So if you don't care, fine then, I don't care either
But I ain't spineless like you, I'm a true believer
In the metaphysical ether, you listenin to the lyrical reaper
The spiritual teacher, empirical speaker
After this album they gon' call me a leader
But I'm not, Killuminati just gon' murder me like 'Pac
Blood sacrifice or not, I don't even wanna be alive
If it's like that, then fuck Tiamat
You can laugh at my appearance
Well fuck you for standin there starin, fuck everything on this planet~!
Including the evil spirits, notwithstanding the aliens
actin like they don't hear us, there's no need to fear us
Just come down and help us, I love James Brown more than I love Elvis
But that don't mean I'm selfish
Soft but hard on the outside like shellfish
Crispy, crunchy, black crawlin out of Hell's pit
You scream for hardcore, I felt it
But what you gon' do when they kill me on some Eminem and L shit?
You won't do a motherfuckin thing
Cause let me tell you why, you a coward and you don't know shit
Cause if my brothers stand next to me, the energy expands collectively
The world was never ready for me
And they ain't ready for they own freedom neither, they perish from the heater
The fire breathers crawl out of they cage to eat 'em
like thin crust pizza, Cthulhu creatures with rough features
Jeepers creepers, good luck with Jesus
How many meters? Reload and squeeze it
I run up in the Vatican with demons, just to get even
That's where the biggest demon is, it's no secret
But nobody else sees it so they won't believe it
But that's when I calm back down, the key word is back down
I got possessed by my own raps, wow~!
Knock knock, who's home? The black Dan Brown
I didn't mean what I said, please don't kill me now
My ghostwriter's not around, plus it was just a freestyle
but at least I got better beats now
Meanwhile, motherfuckers still mad, I feel bad
I'd apologize but you actin like a real fag
What the fuck I'm supposed to feel like?
12 years later I still don't get acknowledged for the shit that I write
But I don't want to talk to you now
It'd be a motherfuckin miracle if you even see me walkin around
They still ask me about "Second Round" even now
"Canibus can you tell us what happened again?" Look at this fuckin clown
Can't get over it, they ask me a loaded question
and act like I'm the one that's promoted it, hang up on 'em
You a cyborg unit with no soul to it
Stupid surrogate, 12 years later I'm on some other shit
And so is the whole world, look at the motherships
And so is the whole world, look at the motherships

[Outro: Professor Griff]
After this album, they gon' call me a leader but I'm not
The Illuminati's gon' kill me just like they did 'Pac
Blood sacrifice, or not
It's Professor Griff the ex-minister
