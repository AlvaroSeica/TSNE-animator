[Gunplay]
Slanging girly in the morning early, got the caster rush
M.O.B. and that's a must, C.O.D. I got no trust
And I be B.M.F.'n, a million won't last a month
All I need is one, P.N.C. and that's enough
And I ain't even crank up yet, but bet I'm gassing up
When my Prada press that peddle bitch you better fasten up
I excel and ash the blunt, they hell a hundred times
That even one hundred-one couldn't bring back how it was
When a brick was seventeen and you ain't have to rob your plug
When rapping was an art, now the shit a jug
Bet you couple dollars, few jewels, and some pussy
I'm getting a little too power drunk, now I'm on that bullshit

[Chorus]
I got a problem and a plan, revolver in my hand
Trying to keep it cold, but y'all won't understand
That's why I roll, that's why I roll with the Bible on the dash
That's why I roll, that's why I roll with the Bible on the dash
I got a problem and a plan, revolver in my hand
Trying to keep it cold, but y'all won't understand
That's why I roll, that's why I roll with the Bible on the dash
That's why I roll, that's why I roll with the Bible on the dash

[Gunplay]
Cutting corner on Coronas, trying to buck up on a bonus
Out her on my lonely, last stogie but I'm focused
Now I know, friends parallel to foe
And all that good pussy leave you parallel to broke
I asked the pastor, what's the fastest way to heaven
for a bastard with a tarnished past, give me your honest answer
With all this Hannah Montana, without the Arm and Hammer
Am I going to get the slammer or the casket
Trying to keep a level head, rolling on this rocky road
This a full time gig, trying to keep this Glock cold
Got the work, water in the pot, need a hot stove
And a down ass bitch, and a squad down to roll

[Chorus]</pre>
