[Verse 1: Peace]
See, strange fruit comes from strange roots
It's a shame; why we afraid of truth?
...Truth is, while people we wanna be hangin'
In the streets and brag about all the dope we be slangin'
I'm maintainin', even though it gets deep
I often wonder, why my people so weak?
Some nights I can't sleep, I should be restin' my mind
Waking up from nightmares of us hangin' like vines
To me, it's a mystery
Seems like, some cats repeatin' history
I got a question: why we hate each other so much?
Another question: why we don't wish each other good luck?
Ridin' in my truck, I be bumpin' them oldies
"Young, Gifted and Black"; that's what Hathaway told me
And my parents showed me, how to act properly
And that's why I know I ain't gotta be

[Chorus: 'Drea and Danny!]
(Strange fruit) I ain't ashamed to say it
I don't think that we advancin', black
People still be plantin' that
(Strange fruit) I don't know what it is
That made us tolerate this hatred for so many years
I'm talkin'
(Strange fruit) Down here, where the mansions' at
You can find 'em where the branch is at
Take a glance at that
(Strange fruit) Can somebody please
Tell me what's goin' on?
What's goin' on...

[Verse 2: Danny!]
Yo, what do you mean I can't
Get this hotel room?
For those of y'all just tunin' in, I'm fumin' again
I'm on tour with two of my friends, we zoomin' again
From city to city, we sippin' on Peruvian gin
But now we sippin' from the cup of reality
A couple legalities are bein' broken
I know this ain't right
How you gon' tell me I can't get this hotel room tonight?
When I talked with you befo' on the phone, you was nice
Now I'm here in the flesh, and I guess that you see
That my skin colour just isn't what you thought it would be
Now is it? ... Look at me when I'm talkin' to you
You don't really wanna get hit with a lawsuit, do you?
You told me it was vacant
When makin' the reservation
Now after seein' my face
Your racism is blatant
I hate to say it but damn...it's hard enough bein' a black man
You treatin' me different because I'm black, man?

[Chorus: 'Drea and Peace]

(Strange fruit) I ain't ashamed to say it
I don't think that we advancin', black
People still be plantin' that
(Strange fruit) I don't know what it is
That made us tolerate this hatred for so many years
I'm talkin'
(Strange fruit) Down here, where the mansions' at
You can find 'em where the branch is at
Take a glance at that
(Strange fruit) Can somebody please
Tell me what's goin' on?
What's goin' on...

[Bridge: Danny! and Peace]

[Danny!] 
Aww c'mon Peace, see how they gon' do me like that man?

[Peace]
Yeah, that's the way it is though...don't sweat it

[Danny!]
No doubt...

[Verse 3: Danny! and Peace]

[Danny!]
I'm glad I talked to you, and got your two cents
I'm through ventin'
Got a new dent in my mind, I had to mention

[Peace]
I'm glad you listened
To my advice and what I told you
Those situations are what we go through

[Danny!]
Throwin' two fists in the sky, it's you and I
Pluckin' our people from these trees
One root at a time

[Peace]
I feel that rhyme
And your two cents
Let's bounce; this cat is actin' like a nuisance

[Chorus - 'Drea, Danny! and Peace] x 2

[Outro: Danny! and Peace]

[Danny!]
I guess that's the way it is, huh

[Peace]
Yeah, that's how it's goin' down

[Danny!]
Yeah, it's all good...fuck it, let's get on through man...
I guess history keeps repeating itself

[Peace]
Yeah, we just gotta deal with it though

[Danny!]
Yo, we out</pre>
