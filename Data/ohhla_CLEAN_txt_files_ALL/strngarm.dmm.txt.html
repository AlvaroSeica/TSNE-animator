[Hook x2: Leviathan]
Yo, we kick nuttin' but hard shit
Y'all niggas on that soft shit
Y'all love to run your mouth
but don't really wanna start shit
Motherfuck you lames that's just in it for the fame
We Monstar in the game, nigga, we conquerin' the game

[Leviathan]
We hit 'em with everything except the kitchen sink
Spittin' Luggies on expensive minks
What made them think they could scrap or go toe-to-toe?
That was a no-no, Monstar golden gats
shootin' diamonds like we was Robo-cops of this industry
Came to serve and protect
Just slaughter all our enemies
Tryin' to save what's left
Rock hardcore hip-hop, mang, although we're a little strange
These brats still can't hang, get exchanged
plus re-arranged, behind skeletons like in a closet
Questioning they own logic, Closterphobic Psycotics
Skarekrow Tracks Hypnotic
Bionic arms send body-blows like Apocalypse
West Coast battalion stallions, strong from our Block Nest!

[Skarekrow]
Blast shots and stash make and fake from balconies
Causin' conspiracy and legacies of the power
Gunpowder on my beard and moustache
My Gun blast, terror graph, like a firing squad stay out of Dodges
Drop like ashes from plugs and gashes and rappin'
tongue-lashes before the chance passes
Yeah, yankin you and your crew passes, releasin' the gases
thick as molasses, while you're gaspin', I'm laughin'

[Mantra]
Sun, I got charged with a Monstar in the third degree (Why's that?)
See, I was causin' mayhem in every city
Throwin' Hallowe'en bashes, Masquerade crashes
Show up damaging Richter scales to 'quake the masses
Strong on the track, fully microphone bullies on the set
But now I ego-trip just to get a rep'
It's a Bizarre thing, pull on my heart string
My rap's elequant, added to the track like a Santana lamment
Never wastin' a thought, my shit could be a hazard
If it is not put in to use correctly, see what happens
We on the look-out, my music is the burner
in the hands of one fan, we steepin' low Watching Pakistan
Too many trials and conceptions, my ways is of the moisture
None'll bubble, when there's smoke in my eyes, I rub
them, The road is visible, take a desolate walk through
My sounds of Blackness for peace are sacrificial

[Hook x2]

[Christbearer]
Nigga, I don't wanna talk (nah), I'm on one
It's the Born-To-Die-Young Christbearer, Red Rum (Christbearer!)
and I'll just take it to the streets
over black waters like the Doobie brothers, motherfuckas Sleep

[Onslot]
Yo I bust raps like shots
tho Onslaught ain't no punk
Fuck around, I have a fully-auto in the trunk
nigga, All I bring is heat, that's all I can come with
I'm doin' this for the cheese nigga, fuck all that other dumb shit
I'm sick of bein' broke, sick of worryin' 'bout the rent
but I don't wanna sell drugs, so I'ma spit rhymes like slugs
Got locked up for a scrap, now I'm back on the attack
Even though I'm on probation I'll still bust a fuckin' gat
I ain't scared of you motherfuckers, I look at y'all and laugh
Get the fuck up out my path nigga prepare to feel the wrath
I don't care if you a killer, I don't care if you move coke
Half y'all niggas probably lyin' talkin' 'bout you sellin' dope
I'm on some hardcore rap, a lot of y'all is soft
There's only a few motherfuckers that really set it off
I can't wait to come out, I want my voice to be heard
Give a fuck 'bout you nerds, you gettin' shot down
like birds

[Skarekrow]
