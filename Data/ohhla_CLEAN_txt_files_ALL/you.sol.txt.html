[Chorus: The Turtles "You Showed Me" sample]
You, showed me how to do
Exactly what you do
How I fell in love with you, you

[Solomon Childs]
I used to do everything for ("you")
I used to try so hard for ("you")
I thought I'd always be with ("you")
Never thought I'd get snaked by ("you")
Stabbed in my back by ("you")
Couldn't believe when you told your friends ("you")
That I'm a dog and I never loved ("you")
And if that was your excuse to do ("you")
Although you thought I would betray ("you")
That's the problem it's always about ("you")
Everything satisfies ("you")
Seen at the movies with that man and ("you")
Gossip, all in the hood about ("you")
Who's in the bed after the club with ("you")
Who's baby father you left the scene with ("you")
You was my wife I can't believe it's so ("oh, oh, it's true")

[Chorus]

[Solomon Childs]
To my friends, I always defended ("you")
To my family, I always defended ("you")
They used to say that I should leave ("you")
Move on from somebody like ("you")
The fish in the sea are better than ("you")
Take care of me, better than ("you")
The talk at the card games be about ("you")
The girls on the benches gossip about ("you")
Don't worry til they stop talking about ("you")
As crazy, as I still love ("you")
Can't live without ("you")
What I'mma do, if I'mma lose ("you")
Cuz can't nobody touch me like ("you")
And if I really break up with ("you")
I hope I find somebody in the future, like ("you")
Feel like I'm lost in time without ("you")
You was my wife, I can't believe it's so ("oh, oh, it's true")

[Chorus]

[Solomon Childs]
So don't nobody ever hurt me like ("you")
They said the nigga that stuck me knew ("you")
The guy that bought the gun from him knew ("you")
Everything was all set up by ("you")
After the crime, he reported back to ("you")
Wicked bitch, have my kids siding with ("you")
On some, daddy, how can we believe ("you")
Mommy, said that we shouldn't believe ("you")
I feel so insane when I see ("you")
Things you do, can only be done by ("you")
I'm upset, I put my time in ("you")
I finally see, i was never meant for ("you")
I should of never hooked up with ("you")
Never fell in love with ("you")
It's something, cuz deep down, I still love ("you")
You was my wife, I can't believe it's so ("oh, oh, it's true")
("Oh, oh, I love you") </pre>
