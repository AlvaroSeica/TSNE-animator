[Ghostface Killah]
Yo, it's Tone Starks, the don, the Face of a Killah
The voice of the past and present, I speak thrillers
Rock a purple robe, crested with 24 karat gold
The chains chunky like the neck of a monkey
Glass slipper, my wallos is made from lion skin
King of the jungle, ain't shit about me humble
Rock a Black Panther hoodie, nigga, made from panther skin
I'm black on the outside and black within
The hood superhero, the muthafuckin' Don Dada
The Don Wilson, nigga, I do what I gotta
I'm a boss, them DeLuca's tried to front on my skin tone
I left the fam and start a fam of my own
A black Italiano, big pinky rings from Sicily
I move like the Don in the fam, it's officially
War time, Starky on some black Avengers
Shadowboxin' with killas that move like ninjas

[Chorus: Ghostface Killah]
I declare war, war on the DeLuca's
Bulletproof jet planes, nigga, you can't shoot us
Can't stop my reign of terror, rise the power
Tone Starks, new king in this crime, ya'll better cower
War, war on the DeLuca's
Bulletproof jet planes, nigga, you can't shoot us
Can't stop my reign of terror, rise the power
Tone Starks, new king in this crime, ya'll better cower

[Masta Killa]
I'm prepared to go to war for the battle of supremacy
There's nothing now to remedy this decision
The only thing left is the loyalty of the family
Cuz once we establish the power, they gon' turn sour
And use everything in they power to shut us down
We've come too far to turn around, Tone
Got a new connect, Don Stone, flew his private jet from Rome
To talk business, he heard your crime saga poems
Looking to invest millions, it's up to you, Tone
This move can make us both rich, your crew is armed
Cocked and ready, to rock steady
It's non-stop hustle and flow, to own casinos, with RZA, Tarantino
It's Wu-Gambino for life, you know how we go
Until the last breathe blow, mi amigo

[Chorus]

[RZA]
Born into a world, where violence, death and destruction
Surrounding him on every turn
Toney Starks took control of his own destiny
And aspired to become one of the four most leaders of the criminal
underworld
Regardless of his will, and the ability to run the streets with
invincibility
There was still those who chose to stand in his way</pre>
