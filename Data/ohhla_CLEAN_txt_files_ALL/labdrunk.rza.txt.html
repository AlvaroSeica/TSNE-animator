[Intro: RZA]
Wu-Tang worldwide, Wu-Tang, Bobby Digital worldwide
wordlwide, word up, all y'all crab MC's out there
Let me spark y'all like this one time

[RZA]
Yo, I make your fragile bones rattle with babbles, chrome bowls
Microphone arrows thrown strike like stone paddles
to ya head, you'll be spread across the floor
and ain't headed for a bead of roses
needle threaded, one jaw have said it
by the fatal blow, tornado blow, battleship
Wu boats will float, torpedo, you can't stay a-float
You sink to the brink of extincted animals
while I bang on your head to the buckle like bawdy animals
Steal stinger, Killa Bee ten inches, sharper than picket fences
quick to detect your intentions, if they're wicked
meditate, build the house on the next dimension
My flow is co-hension, you'll be startled

Stumbled into my lab half-drunk
Honey-dipped, stinkin blunts
smellin like I ran over I skunk
Wiz poppin junk, it must be that time of the month
But fuck it, I got to spit this verse from my lung

Stumbled inside my lab half-drunk
Honey-dipped, stinkin blunts
smellin like I ran over I skunk
Wiz poppin junk, it must be that time of the month
But fuck it, I got to spit this verse, yo

Pound drop your head to the canvas
It's like you got no fuckin manners
You be duckin hammers, we be clutchin banners
Touchin amateur challengers, we try to throw off balancers
Keep a 120 brain compounder inside the cannister
You can't compare to an atom of my hair
While my verbal shot be drillin through the cave of your ear
Recochet to the ceilin, the desert eagle hemisphere
Deflect off your medula, exit off to the rear
MCin is easier to me than breathin
and makin beats to me is easier than bein
Killin vibes is easier than seein
I be geein, and fuck with the Wu-Tang Clan is wildin
bitch, than a 1000 foot hill with broke steez
Plot by rocks, wildily ghost, still needle flyin trees
My mind sees all of the unusual energies
Tell me, have you ever felt a sunshine breeze?

Stumbled into my lab half-drunk
Honey-dipped, stinkin blunts
smellin like I ran over I skunk
Wiz poppin junk, it must be that time of the month
But fuck that, I got to get a verse from my lung

Stumbled inside my lab half-drunk
Honey-dipped, stinkin blunts
smellin like I ran over I skunk
Wiz poppin junk, it must be that time of the month
But fuck it, I got to spit it

Yo, your floweress is powerless against me
Your cowardess attack can master track alchemist raps
Rap Malcolm, my champagne staims, silver, lex bullet 4
Millenium falcon, just to protect the Wu-Tang's sacred valium
Chased by jake's planes, I race state's police
We slay microphone foes, the size of ro-beasts
Unpredictable pain is inflictable
Razor blade will ripple you, death blow will cripple you
1.9 level meter, son, you just skipped on my class
is here to rap camera classes, hi-jack these bus passes
This system was symphonic, jacked with no masses
Sound systems blast-es, rhyme system was writin, well-casted
Strong as safari hunter, calm in black mongo
Un-plug the dynamic mic cord and hung you
from a towerin speaker, I tape your ear to the tweater
My mental idea's are more severe than your heater
Innocent drive-bys, 85'ers shoot try to over throw us
They love us like babies, once they get to know us
Your floweress is powerless against me

Stumbled into my lab half-drunk
Honey-dipped, stinkin blunts
smellin like I ran over I skunk
Wiz poppin junk, it must be that time of the month
But fuck that, I got to get a verse from my lung

Stumbled into my lab half-drunk
Honey-dipped, stinkin blunts
smellin like I ran over I skunk
Wiz poppin junk, it must be that time of the month
But fuck that, I got to get the verse out my lung</pre>
