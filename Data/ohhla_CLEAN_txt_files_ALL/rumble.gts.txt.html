[Verse One]
Rumblefish, breaks heads like dishes
Rumblefish, is quicker than other fishes
Rumblefish, cuz he's the big fish with the death wish
Acting like a Waco, from Texas
Flexes, as he fronts in the stolen Lexus
Don't give a damn cuz the man don't respect us
But this is the plot, three kids at the bus stop
Bumrush the ride, now who's the big shot?
Reach for glock but it's locked on safety
Say G, do you think that blackfish is tasty?
Don't waste me, Rumblefish starts to bleed
But these other little fishsticks, they need to feed

Avoided the trigger pull, you're lucky and shit money
Cop had his gun drawn and dude thought that shit was funny
So I ducked, down an alley way before he could pop it

Blackfish in the stream of a whole lot of others
Contemplatin since birth how to get mines first
I live a life of daily rep, so tell me which is worse
On my way, in a hearse, to the bottom of a pond
Or hustlin for my ducats cold-like gettin it on
In the stream of society, why did they lie to me
Got better things to do than write some white man's biography
So after they dissed, rolled up that spliff
Clenched up my fists and became the
