Typed by: AZ Lyrics

It all started late on a saturday night
Said who's got the spliffs and who's got the pint?
Look out the window, said to my surprise
Here comes the man in blue and his flashing lights
He said now "your party's fuckin' over with
Because ya smokin' blunt sand you're rolling spliffs
Now tell me what'cha think I oughta think of this?
Say want'cha pull out your sack or you be missed"
Say now Mr. Officer come charge me all the time
You got me for possession, but I swear that it's not mine
No matter what you do or say
It's bound to come right back this way
And if you want a moment's please say
This what you'll say c'mon an'

Let's get this party started
Until the break of dawn an'
Let's keep this party movin'
Until there's no one home an'
Let's get this party started
Until the break of dawn an'
Let's keep this party movin'
All you got to do is sing

Can't take the pressure for long
All they wanna do is roll 'til after 2
Getting high then they singing this song
Snap another b then drink another brew
[X2]
C'mon

At the roadblock but me so sorry mr.cop
I bet you anything me gonna get stopped
At the roadblock but me so sorry mr.cop
I bet you anything me gonna get stopped
Hey mista coppa said now why'd you stoppa me? na na
I wasn't driving the car badly
I said don't go lock me up because me smoke sensi
Yes, this is the ghetto but I live 'cross the sea
Say now mr.officer come charge me all the time
You got me for possession but i'll swear that its not mine
No matter what you do or say
It's bound to come right back this way
And if you want a moment's please say
This is what you'll say c'mon an'

Let's get this party started
Until the break of dawn an'
Let's keep this party movin'
Until there's no one home an'
Let's get this party started
Until the break of dawn an'
Let's keep this party movin'
All you got to do is sing

Can't take the pressure for long
All they wanna do is roll 'til after 2
Getting high then they singing this song
Snap another b then drink another brew
