Preach

[CHORUS]

Wishin' Upon a star
Hopin' heavens reveal who we truly are
In those moments when happiness seems far
We so scarred
We hold God deep inside
Please God

[VERSE 1]

I said home is where the hate is
I feel like Miles Davis
Kinda blue
Stirrin' trouble in My bitches brew, it's true
Niggas that don't know you choose to judge you
Gon take more than feet to walk in my shoes
Nowadays dudes got beef than meat at the barbecue
it bothers you like it does me
Knowledge is key
Unlock passages
Civilizing savages
Throwin' your mind overboard like
Slaves in middle passages
Who we are is not a mystery, god
Kings and queens and artists
Check your history, god
Matter of fact
The pages are intact
Through the hieroglyphs
See myself in a different light
When I write, suddenly
Revelations came in Deuteronomy
An exodus before the genesis came upon me
Now my oratory speaks these ghetto horror stories
Deep inside . . .


[CHORUS]

[VERSE 2]

Yeah
Check it
I let my mind travel
On occasion my body tags along
Hopin' to unravel the mysteries of Babylon
You never know a good thing til it's gone
Once it's gone it's hard to admit that you was wrong
Then the tip of your pen, Freudian slips as you begin
Another song, Philly cats call that a jawn
Freddie Hubbard on the horn
These new jacks can't see me like a mustache on a newborn
Black son searchin' for the one, the Black Neo
Seeing visions for real while yall watch Cleo
A Griot who speaks Creole
Pidgin to be exact
Creature of habitat like these corporate cats
They might dress pretty
Attitudes are pretty ugly
Inside thet tainted, stained with hipocrisy
It's a slave economy
The poor righteous teachers tried to reach us
Rock dis Funky Joint in your speakers
I'm not a fan so I don't hang in the bleachers
Good Jesus
They wanna do me in like Brutus did Caesar
Whether Emmanuel or Ebenezer
Allah or Rastafari, the good Lord
He's my keeper
So if Jesus walks with Kanye
I'm sure he'll listen to this
Oblige me like Mary J. to
Transcribe these scripts to the lost tribes
Yes I, Jah Bless I
No man can test I
Or mind trick I Like Jedi, I'm up early like redeye
Learnin' more about myself every time I write
I Wanda like Sykes
Will there be a time 
When they recite my lines
Like Dave Chappelle sound bites
I stay weary of O'Reilly
Hope you do too
Me, I'm doing cool
Like Sway and Baby Blue in the UK
I want the booty (bootay)
To realize my dreams today
Money's the root of evil, TouchÂŽ
Aside from Groupies  and Stunna Shades
There's more to this creative art form
Word is bond
Yeah, ya dig?
