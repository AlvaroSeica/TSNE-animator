(chorus)

Bounce and shake it work it pop that thang
You make a nigga wanna get on top that thang
Won't you bounce and shake it work it pop that thang
You make a nigga wanna get on top that thang
Won't you bounce and shake it work it pop that thang
You make a nigga wanna get on top that thang
Won't you bounce and shake it work it pop that thang
You make a nigga wanna get on top that thang
(You better show me what you working with)

<verse>
This for the twerkers that twerk
The poppers that jerk
The shorties in skirts
Bounce that ass i'm tryna get me some work
Let your knees touch the ground get down go off
If you wanna get nasty fuck it takes them drawers off
Break me off somethin' proper
Hey P poppa won't you let me get on top of ya
Know i wanna knock ya
Sweaty as a motherfucker still don't give a fuck
Humpin' like I just got out of central lock up

(chorus)

<verse>
Girl give it to me i'ma give it back to ya
If you like it rough i could do it like that to ya
I ain't tryna mac to ya
Just wanna rap to ya
Take it to the back let you dance in my lap sugar
Go ahead with that actin' bad and let me holla at ya
The way you shake it make me wanna throw some dollas at ya
Bring it this way play with me if you wan't to
I ain't bout that playin i'ma show you what i'm gon do

(Chorus)

<verse>
I seen ya on the club scene since i was 16
They say you danced obscene since you was 15
What the fuck you mean we should take it slow?
Got a body let me know you been doing that tae-bo
I know you ain't a ho don't fuck on the first night
But that's alrigt you gonna do it tonight
Goddamn you tight what the fuck is your name?
I think i seen ya on the soul train poppin' that thang
I'm in back of you my boy in front of you
What the fuck you gon do he want some too
Stop drop it to the flo'
I want some mo'
Let me test them shocks on the 4X4 ya heard me

(chorus)

Kane and Abel most wanted on that ass</verse></verse></verse></pre>
