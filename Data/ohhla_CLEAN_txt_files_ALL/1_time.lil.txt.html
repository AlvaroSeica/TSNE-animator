[Intro]
Angels Exodus
This for anybody who ever lost somebody
Yo Mistah F.A.B., Bay Area, West Side I see you
Keep your head up, this for you

[Verse 1]
My brother lost his momma
I don't know how he made it
I'm just praying that he make it, I know he will
Mistah F.A.B. be in my prayers forever
Nigga, I never die hater
Start to think about my life and all the time passing
Can't take nothing back so living with it
Feel gifted for the breath that I'm breathing
Living on borrowed time if you need a reason
Niggas say heaven and hell, but I don't believe it
Just believe in spirits, just believe in breathing
Please help me if I walk the crooked path even
Please help me if I -- when the past is speaking
Even though I listen to him for the inspiration
I know life real and we seperated
But we gotta get together before the game's over
R.I.P. all the angels and the fallen soldiers

[Chorus]
1 time, oh, 1 time, yeah
Give it up for the people we lost
Spread love for the people that's gone
1 time, oh, 1 time, yeah
Give it up for the people we lost
Spread love for the people that's gone

[Verse 2]
The biggest tax seeing the death of a family memeber
The mourning process, January to December
Cold nights hell feeling like hell in November
Where's my thoughts? I don't remember
Even though I look happy I'm still a beginner
Even though I pray to God I'm still a sinner
One day I'll realize that this time is precious
No movie, real life living like I'm Precious
Bad food, bad family, dealing with the pressure
A lot of unprotected sex, didn't learn my lesson
Please let just me - life with no judgement
Please let me live my life with no fussing
I already think I'mma die from the way I'm living
I'm by myself eating fast food on Thanksgiving
Just a picture of what I'm doing on a daily basis
R.I.P. the fallen soldiers now heaven's angels

[Chorus]
1 time, oh, 1 time, yeah
Give it up for the people we lost
Spread love for the people that's gone
1 time, oh, 1 time, yeah
Give it up for the people we lost
Spread love for the people that's gone
