[Intro: Nicki Minaj]
Yo! Man...
Man, ughh

[Chorus 2X: Nicki Minaj]
Bitches ain't shit, and they ain't say nothin
A hundred motherfuckers can't tell me nothin
I beez in the trap, be-beez in the trap
I beez in the trap, be-beez in the trap

[Nicki Minaj]
Man I been did that, man, I been popped off
And if she ain't tryin to give it up she get dropped off
Let me bust that U-e, bitch bust that open
Might spend a couple thou' just to bust that open
Rip it off no jokin, like your name Hulk Hogan
Niggaz move weight and sell, but live in Hoboken
Bitch spit that crack, like I'm in that trap
So if you need a hit, then I'm with that bat

[Chorus]

[2 Chainz]
Yo... okayyy~!
Okay now Nicki Nicki Nicki, put it in your kidney
Got a new LS 450 ain't no keys in this doo-hickey
If I weren't rappin I'd be trappin, if I wasn't trappin I'd be pimpin
If weren't pimpin I'd be gettin it - period
I don't smoke no Bobby, but my denim be from Ricky
Got your girl on Molly and we smoke loud and drinkin
Got my top back so you can see what I been thinkin
If you know, me then you know I've been thinkin Franklins
Money, thousands, True Religion trousers
Got a private home, started from them public houses
Hair weave killer, causin her arousal
Audi A8, told them Audi 5000, ugghh!!

[Chorus]

[Bridge: repeat 2X]
Damn~! Damn, what they say about me?
I don't know man! Fuck is on your biscuit?
If I get hit, swingin on a big bitch
I don't know man I'm shittin on your whole life

[Chorus] - 1/2

[Nicki Minaj]
Man I'm out in Texas, man I'm out in A-town
Then I'm up in Chi-town, or Miami shuttin it down
It's that New Orleans, it's L.A. or The Bay
It's New York, Philly, and the whole DMV
I'm a Detroit player, man it's North-South Cacks'
Ohio Pittsburgh, that St. Louis on deck
It's Delaware, Connecticut, it's New Jersey got hella bricks
It's Queens, Brooklyn and yea they wildin
Bronx, Harlem, and Staten Island

[Chorus] - 1/2
