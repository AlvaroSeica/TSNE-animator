[Intro: Scarface]
I don't really remember.. feeling like this
Geto Boys, Greatest Hits
Bonus track, huh.. almost made me nightmare
I LOVE.. Mary, I LOVE.. Mary
Baby, I love you  --------&gt; Ashanti

[Verse One: Scarface]
In a great day in a morning, I'm on something about ya
And every now and then I can't help it, but to think about ya
Hated that we ended like this, but I had to leave you
I knew that I would miss you one day, and I would need ya
More now then I ever did, and I'm heart broken
Staring at my eyes lit shot, wide open
I love forming in my life.. with another baby
And expecting you for somethin, other bitches just playing crazy

[Chorus: Ashanti X2]
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby (baby, I love you)
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby (baby, I love you)
[Scarface] I'm happy just to hear your name, do your thang

[Verse Two: Scarface]
Had me thinking, she was the only I had ever needed
Sticky brown body like ohh.. let me heat it
I remember seeing candle sticks, then smelling her in scents
The intimate, and counting the days of sex
A nigga is so sick, I had to call her up to say nothing
Damn, I had something about this bitch
Wouldn't let my friends kill her
Taking penitentiary chances just to be with her
And deep with her, and sleep with her
Stronger than the Lebanon Blum
Once she gets you locked in the clutches you can't run
In the dark, I'm hearing footsteps, and you can't sleep
You find yourself so in love with this bitch, that you can't eat
Paranoia, that's a feeling so scary
This shit almost made me need Mary

[Chorus: Ashanti X2]

[Verse Three: Scarface]
Mary, I'm in home sick, I gotta see you
And when I finally hit you this time, I'd never leave you
I took your love for granite, I was blinded
And I'm hoping you can accept my apology;
For this one last time
You can tell that I ain't happy here
Cause I can't control up.. this hashish
But Mary I loved you, just like I told you
I'm persisted that I have write you this letter;
For this reason
To see if you'd be down for a treason
I love you.. Mary

[Outro: Ashanti]
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby (baby, I love you)
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby (baby, I love you)
I love it just to hear your name, do your thang
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby (I love you)
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby (I love you)
[Scarface] I'm happy just to hear your name, do your thang
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby (I love you)
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby (I love you)
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby (I love you)
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby (I love you)
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby (I love you)
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby (I love you)</pre>
