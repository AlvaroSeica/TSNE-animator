[Chorus] 
Look around, look around, look around  
And tell me what do you see? 
Mmm-mmm, yeah...
Look around, look around, look around 
And tell me what you see? 

[Verse One: Betty Wright]
Look, look at what cheating cost  
Look at what you have lost  
Now look at the stupid things 
That cost you your wedding ring 
Looking for friends, they're gone  
Looking for love and none shown  
Looks like our vows we've outgrown  

[Chorus]
Look around, look around, look around  
And tell me what do you see?
Well you won't see me, no!
Look around, look around, look around 
And tell me what you see?   
Soon you won't see me

[Verse Two: Betty Wright]
Look, look through the real window 
Look how we were so close 
You wanted me the most 
I know cause you used to boast  
Now look at this paper doll 
Suited to you and that's all  
Hard to watch a blessing turn into a curse 
And bad is getting worse, ohh! 

[Chorus]

[Interlude]
Be a man, tell me to my face I've been replaced  
Be a man, tell me to my face 
Be a man, tell me to my face I've been replaced  
Be a man, tell me to my face 

[Chorus]

[Bridge: Betty Wright]
I admit I might shed a few tears, huh 
But I'll get over it in the coming years  
In fact, I might go, I just might go fishin, well 
I just might go, window wishin, look ARROOUND, look around

[Chorus]

[Outro]
You won't see me..

You won't see me..

I'm gon' get ghost, baby
Bye-bye..</pre>
