Beat you DOWN, b-b-beat y-you DOWN, Beat you DOWN...

Listen up world, as the Poet attacks
This is just a little sample of how I wax
BDP is trying to dis, we know that they're on it
Everytime we make a record, they get disappointed
Nobody said hip hop started out in the Bridge
But now you've dissed all of Queens, so we know how you live
You try to get paid talkin bout my town
When I battle you punk, I'mo* beat - you - DOWN          *[sic]

How could you say the Bridge is over? We've just begun
You soft sucker MC, KRS-One
Can you believe it, party people? He raps like a rasta!
Boogie Down Productions are full of imposters
They say things, that are not true
Now the Poet and Noel will break it down to you
Bronx started hip hop, but couldn't maintain it
Now they're gettin jealous 'cause Queens has made it
THAT's why those suckers are trying to dis
'cause we're getting PAID, and they're getting pissed!
Just think about it, people
I speaking the facts, and
Manhattan keeps making it; Queens do the taxin'!
My name is Poet, for the top I am bound
Anybody in my way, is getting beat DOWN

Now back in the days, when hip hop began
Queens was rocking with the hardest jams
Over there in the Bronx, you jammed with house speakers
We was rocking bass bottoms, and JBL[?] tweeters!
Bound up and down [???]
Was Infinity machines, and New Sounds
You say that the Bronx was rockin the place
Well you just got put on to sub bass
Man, the old school, they used to duel
And the [pumped?] New sound was the one to rule
The Infinity machine, taking out power
Ever since the days, you been ALL on ours!
That we had the jams that were worth a lot
I know you remember when the [bertha rocked?]
people [?] so low, it shook the gound
Man, even Back THEN we was beatin you DOWN!

K R S One, You sound like a sissy
You want to battle me, yo let's get busy
Battles I enjoy, they improve our tactics
I'm telling you now, you're purely practice!
And if you want to fight, put down your mic
and we will rock ass for the whole damn night
You can get you're whole crew, but don't swing on
'cause I'm knocking down posses with my Python
I don't need bodyguards, cause this boy's bad
And Noel got my back with the 45 Mag!
So come on and roll, so we can get buck
This is one MC, that don't give a fuck
Don't EVER let me hear you say Queens is soft
'cause we're going to the Bronx, with sawed-offs!
Yes, Bronx started hip hop; I'll give you that
But you also the creators of the drug called crack
You thought we don't know; you thought we forgot
Everybody in your crew has beamed up to scott!
I know you want to battle for the things I said
Just remember Poet, who put out that head
Beat Down!

I know that you're mad, cause we got loose
But you tried to dis Marley, and Sir Juice[?]
Just remember, we know how you're playing a game
You're trying to get fame off Marley's name
Just take this advice from Noel and Poet
Stop trying to dis Queens, and get off the tip
'cause me and Noel will be back to crush
You'll NEVER LEAVE Bronx if you ever dis us
You don't like what I said, you don't like how I sound
Just battle me boy, so I can Beat - you - DOWN!</pre>
