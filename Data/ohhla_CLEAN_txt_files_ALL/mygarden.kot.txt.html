Typed by: AZ Lyrics

(Life is good you know, plant your see and watch it grow, ya)

One seed two seed 3,4, and 5
How many of these seeds can they keep alive so I'm singin (singin)

Here in my garden (here in my garden)
I'm harvesting everything with love (love [4x])
and it gets faster now (wo [5x])
I'm planting my garden (planting my garden)
harvesting everything with love (love [4x])
the sun keeps shinning down (wo [5x])

One seed two seed 3,4, and 5
How many of these seeds can they keep alive and so I'm singin (singin)
do delong the fact my gardens sacred
Ain't nobody gonna come and rape it ain't nobody gonna come and take it
Its my whole life
Love and passion consumes the reaction
now feed them the feeling that grow them so high
we've been baby the blossoms partaking
what's awesome and spread out the world that's no lie

Here in my garden (here in my garden)
I'm harvesting everything with love (love [4x])

and it gets faster now (wo [5x])
I'm planting my garden (planting my garden)
harvesting everything with love (love [4x])
the sun keeps shinning down (wo [5x])

I love it when spring comes around
I love puttin seeds in tha ground
I love this piece that I found
could it be another piece of the puzzle looks like a baby tree
pass me a shovel
so I can dig it up and put it in a nice place
mite be trainwreck mite be silver haze well anyways Ima move it
to a better spot
so it can get sunlight and be some better pot

Everything gonna chronic always burnin on a bag[?]
Got the good budz even got a lil hash callin me a plane
always flying threw the sky
captin kronik I'm super duper high
I'm super dupper fly
I'm a super duper guy
never spill a bong always got a clean pipe

If you wanna come along stand by my side
take a hit of this get ready for the ride

I'm a take a hit of that and you take a hit of this
roll a fat fatter makes cannabis bliss cause
where I live everybody's got weed to give
so where I live cover up our eyeballs u dig
we get so high so cal
everything things always better cause we so smoked out
kottonmouth kings and we wont slow down
still blowing smoke rings bitch watch wat now

Snacks stay open like 711
I smoke my bud like 24/7 get a tight pack never dry in the bag
it was kinda blunt wrapped I'm high as the heavens
if I get goes pro then I won't fold
roll the swift man fire with the [?] Drop prop pop
now go poppidy pop pop

ma loo?

Here in my garden (here in my garden)
I'm harvesting everything with love (love [4x])
and it gets faster now (wo [5x])
I'm planting my garden (planting my garden)
harvesting everything with love (love [4x])
the sun keeps shinning down (wo [5x])

Its harvest time the moon was shine pure magic in the air
the universe so miracle like drum sticks on a snare
the cycling the seasons change the healing that repairs
We pass around the sacred pipe then hold it in the air
we blow the smoke in 4 directions giving thanks each time
then nothing can reward the gods like fruit at harvest time
so plant your seeds and love the soil and let water it each day
and live your life with pure intention good things will come your way
(so they say)

Here in my garden (here in my garden)
I'm harvesting everything with love (love [4x])
and it gets faster now (wo [5x])

I'm planting my garden (planting my garden)
harvesting everything with love (love [4x])
the sun keeps shinning down (wo [5x])

One seed two seed 3,4, and 5
How many of these seeds can they keep alive
and so I'm singin (singin) do delong the fact my gardens sacret
Ain't nobody gonna come and rape it ain't nobody gonna come and take it
Its my whole life</pre>
