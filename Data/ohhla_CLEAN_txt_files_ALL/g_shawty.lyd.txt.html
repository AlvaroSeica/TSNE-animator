[Lloyd - RAPPING]
This, is, a
Trick, that
Track, me

(Verse 1)
I guess if I can let this woman
Slip away
Cause I got my eye on you
I see you lookin'
Over your shoulder
Let me make my way over

Hook: Lloyd
Excuse me, miss lady, how you doin'
Your body lookin' right
You're the type I like
Can I pursue in
Can I get a little closer
So I can get to know you
And exchange names and thangs
Before the night is over

Chorus: Lloyd
All I
Really want is
For you to back it up
Go on and put your weight on it
Cause it's alright
Do what you wanna
Make me believe ya
Oooh, I wanna see ya
Get it shawty (Get it shawty...)
Get-get-get-get-get
Get it shawty (Get it shawty...)

(Verse 2)
I guess if we can let the night just
Drift away
So baby, what you gon' do
Cause I don't wanna lose it
Come on, keep it movin'

Repeat Hook

Repeat Chorus

(Rap Verse)
Jeans tight, high heels
This is how you make me feel
Lips glossed, teeth white
Apple bottoms, let me bite
Spend the night
Catch a flight
We can do what-what you like
Feeling right, ya smellin' good
Let get this understood
Is there something you're not telling me
Are you the daughter of Frankey Beverly?
It's the way you move
The way you groove
I'm a fan, and you're the celebrity
She doin' freaky stuff
Shawty got me geeked, tough
Like Fabo
I got Play-doh
Let me show you street love
Ow!

Repeat Chorus</pre>
