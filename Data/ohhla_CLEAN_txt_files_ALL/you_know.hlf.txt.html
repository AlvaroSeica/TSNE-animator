[Chorus (4x)]

Who am I?
(radio skit: Lil' nigga 1/2 dead

[Verse 1]
you know who I am, you know my motherfucking name
Long Beach is the city, Dogg Pound the game
1/2 Dead steppin' true the do'
with a 4-4
everybody get faced down on the fucking flo'
and yo
give up your do'
and um, give up your ho'
and give me the keys the that motherfucking 6-4
hittin' swithces, bitches all on my nuts
cause I drops nuttin' but funky cuts
shuts
I don't know why, I be so fly
way up in the sky till the day I die
I, ain't doing nuttin' but straight clownin'
rollin' true your hood, Eastside Dogg Poundin'
and I don't give a fuck about a nigger
cause every single day my game grows bigger
and um, if a nigga really wanna show me
he better hurry up and act like he know me
because

[Chorus (4x)]

[Verse 2]
I'm coming from the Eastside of the ocean
with the macrobiotic lotion
now let me see your hands in the air with some motion
movin' up straight from left to right
cause we gon' rock this fucking party like all night (ooooh weeee)
cause I don't give a fuck about a punk ass cop
I shoot him in his knees and watch his bitch ass drop
to the ground, the Pound is my gang
I told ya
now I gotta fold ya, scold ya and ??? ya
and what you wanna trust ya punk
you got stomp by H-D dog in his dead ass trunk (dead ass nigga)
and that's how it goed and that's how it be
don't fuck with a nigga from the LBC (nigga)
cause you can ??? with this mental
and thrown a park fucking with a BG with a gang of hard (nigga)
so sit down befor you get smacked
bitch ass nigga
you know where my hard is at
because

[Chorus (4x)]

[Verse 3]
like the I says make him say it again
cause it's the weedpin and it'll drop of gin
and juice, get my caps l loose
fuck a gang trues
and I'll re-produce
some mo' gangsta shit for your monkey ass
and niggas will be asking me how it will be so damn fast
but I don't tell 'em shit
I let 'em pay for his nuts
cause like I said I drops nuttin' but funky cuts
and all you hookers and ho's
all lickin' my fingers
so could you please back up and give me my space?
huh, cause I, gots to drop this gangsta shit
and if you to close

1/2 Dead is in the house in the Pound, in the back
ready to get yo' punk ass out, fool

[Chorus (4x)]
