Break the system break the locks break the rules
Everybody going broke and this shit ain't no breaking news
The banks been breaking dudes those they take for fools
Most of them their collar blue with no mouth of silver spoon
So this Langston Hughes blues is for every race and hue
Push back and if they won't budge them make them move
The unstoppable force is us so crush grooves
With the impact of pimp slaps sledge hammers and cannons
Pledge maximum damage to a fascist slave master
Better get them freedom passes or else it's 20 lashes
Mother fucker, Ya Sha Clack Clack
My jobs to blast back at a jolly fat cat
With a rat up on his lap, hungry about to feast
We in the belly of the beast and the monster's obese
And it's sponsored by the Chief Commander in charge
Leader of the free world versus a poet a large

Apply pressure!
Apply pressure!
Apply pressure!
Apply pressure 'til it
Break Break Break Break
Break Break Break Break
Break Break Break Break
Break Break Break
Til it

Incite a riot, incite a mother fucking riot
'Tis the climate of the pirate, so get your eye ripped
From the socket, grab an eye patch and launch a rocket
Run up in congress take their attention as your hostage
Cock back knowledge blast holes in their politics
Shove the barrel of your fury down their throats make em swallow it
With no apology grab a senator by the color quick
Shack out every penny every quarter every dollar
That he got from some lobbyist on that corporate scholarship
Grimy University is where is alma mater is
So what's the problem kids, you feeling cheated there
You feeling that the game is rigged and you can't beat it far
Well homie look it here, I'll help you see it clear
Beware, the big fish feed the little ones to bears
Now which one are you in this river of despair
If you dare to be free then first war must be declared

Apply pressure!
Apply pressure!
Apply pressure!
Apply pressure 'til it
Break Break Break Break
Break Break Break Break
Break Break Break Break
Break Break Break
Til it
Break Break Break Break

A yo Quez man, why you talking politics
We ain't trying to hear that why don't you talk bout stacking dollars thick
Talk about them bitches and how you make em swallow it
What about them haters man, yo swag and how you balling BITCH!!
That all you following, I ain't saying run for college just acknowledge when
Them freedoms that you once had quickly they'll abolish them
That hope and change shit don't believe it it's just parlor tricks
Cause even black presidents lie
Might be the lesser evil but the evidence cries
Out bloody murder drone bombing shit on the sly
So precise that the spies could even spit in the eye
Of an insurgent burning down American flags
With Allah in his heart a pipe bomb in his bag
And when them drones come they're killing everything in their path
Including innocent women and children, fade to black</pre>
