bad bitches, countin doe, baggin rocks - crazy 
vehicles.....kitted.....my whole teams committed - we was poor as 
kids..... but now it seems we've done did it and blew - other 
niggas find the style hard to chew, talkin bout we too wild, and
that's 
emphatically true, so don't cross us....or you'll be on the 
ground countin losses - for rea; - every nigga I know will peel a 
motherfuckin dome like stockin - we be the owner of the style 
many niggas be jockin - blocks be rocklin - Glock pops alot and,
damn, 
there ain't no stoppin me or my mans. We like whatever. 
Pop told me that this money's not forever so I look for investments
for 
my crew to bury treasure. That be it, say when ya makin 
money , paw, ya see it - cause if ya can't be paid, it's like ya can't 
be shit HOOK Ringleaders are coming, get up your dick-beaters 
- or heaters - and share the mind state of a fetus - can't beat us -
and 
lyrically them niggas can't see this as it go's - we turn kilo's 
into litres. Pounds turn to smoke in the concrete flood - and blood
will 
often turn the dirt into mud. Bulletts become shells - 
names become bells, and if you blow street trial, nigga your cell 
becomes hell - said even time don't tell, at least that's how it used 
to be, but it's a different day and time and strong eyes don't see
down 
the wire - ready to blow the empire like a friar, smoking 
blunts strong as desire - a messiah - raised amongst men that
conspire 
to retire but often end up the town crier - In the fire of a 
cold world yo, said it be flamin - still we aimin to be the one - Titus 
&amp; Haymon HOOK Get ready - my whole teams known to rock 
steady - No Getty - I gots more sauce than spaghetti - a machete -
I'll 
turn your whole frame to confetti - to the nitty-gritty, we 
bout to flip the pity petty - when braves become slaves and plots
become 
graves - and strays fly in the air like they was 
Blue-Jays Robbers can be cops - while thuggs police blocks - I sit 
beside my window sippin sky on the rocks - to see the church 
got locks - no goodness in gracious - Loungin with robber barrons
in 
rooms thats palacious - to weigh dissin us with the need to 
lay down - no more misunderstanding - coming at you , aye-now,
who be 
talking - better than that yo, who be hawkin - I suggest 
you turn around and just start walking, or I'm a catch you coolin
talkin 
what a fly life and keep it real and cut your throat with a 
butter-fly knife HOOK GET SWAZY - WE ABOUT TO FLIP
THE SCRIPT AND GET 
CRAZY RICH KIDS UP FOR RICH BIDS 
BABY - GOIN ALL OUT - GETTIN DOWN GETTIN GRAVY
- ON THE DAILY
