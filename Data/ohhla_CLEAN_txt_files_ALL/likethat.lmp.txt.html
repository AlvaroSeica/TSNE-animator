[Verse 1: Fred Durst]
L-I-M-P
In the place to be
Never went to college or had an ID
Now all the critics wanna know about me
But if you read about me, you don't know about me
Every reporters wanna dog me
And stick their noses up my [{*fuckin' ass*}] before they rob me
In every ID, you'll see my face on a Spin inside
Criticizin' my hobby again
These [{*motherfuckers*}] don't know (They don't know)
I open magazines, checkin' out my life like a [{*fuckin'*}] show
And now I'm gettin' mad at
Where the good was
You always put the bad in
I can't have that
See I'm the one who gets laughed at
But that [{*shit'll*}] pass, cause I always get the last laugh
And I'll keep coming with my revenge
And leave you loose at the ends like a heroine syringe (D'oooh!)
And keep rolling in this new Benz
With all my fake friends
That break when the tape ends
I'm staying platinum on this rolex
No need to go high-tech with these seven figure checks
Cause I just won the lotto
My beats from DJ Lethal
My man John Otto, the desperados
I found life gets so funny
With the single on the Billboard
And a little bit of money

[Chorus: Fred Durst]
Now all the critics wanna hit it
All the critics wanna hit it
The [{*shit*}] can't how we did it
All these critics wanna hit it
All these critics wanna hit it
The [{*shit*}] can't how we did it

[Fred Durst (DJ Lethal)]
It's like that y'all ("And the beat goes on")
It's like that y'all
It's like that and a that
Like that y'all ("And the beat goes on")
It's like that y'all ("And the beat goes on")
It's like that y'all
It's like that and a that
Like that y'all ("And the beat goes on")

[Verse 2: Reverand Run]
It's like a tick-a-tock, tee and a tick-a-tock too
A full-fledged member of the Holland crew
Like a lime to a lemon
A lemon to a lime
It's DJ Run, coming with the raucous of rhymes
The Kings from Queens, from Queens come kings
Raising Hell like a class when the lunch bell rings
Beat, beat, y'all
And we don't quit
It's DJ Run, I'm about to flip
Bust it
I'm gettin' cheddar, comin' better than the rest of y'all
Gettin' paid ever since the Fresh Festival
So deaf, your set is a M.M.O.
N.S., oh yes, Rev one in the flow
The King Of Rock, who
To be my hobby and job
And when I come and bring the raucous, suckers duck us and dud
It's just a one-two-three
Three to two, one
My man, D.M.C., my name's DJ Run
The news is posted, the word is spread
DJ Run's comin' hard
And rollin' with Fred

[Chorus]

[Fred Durst] It's like that y'all ("And the beat goes on")
             It's like that y'all
             It's like that and a that
             Like that y'all ("And the beat goes on")
[DJ Lethal]  "Run-D.M.C. and Jam Master Jay"
[Fred Durst] It's like that y'all ("And the beat goes on")
             It's like that y'all
             It's like that and a that
             Like that y'all ("And the beat goes on")

[Verse 3: John Otto]
For every average ear
Beware
Of this content
Construct the scene
Prolific
The beat's sophisticate
To leave you less eminent, stuck
With the complex in this context
To bring divinity
To all emcees
Soft estreed
This philosophy extends from the bass drum, slay some
I lay some to rest
To screw legislation
Put you on the quest for imitation
But now the sign reads "Foes" in my window pane
The high elevates and simulates your fate
Premature tape
Ejaculate
Feel the thump just out the high eight
Phone rings heavy in your dome (Yeah)
I wonder what's it like to be a clone with that smiley goat
You so-called throat
These notes deep throat through pass and
Paragraphs
Tracks
I know you can't understand
This abstract's enormous, my sound is enormous

[Chorus]

[Fred Durst] It's like that y'all ("And the beat goes on")
             It's like that y'all
             It's like that and a that
             Like that y'all ("And the beat goes on")
[DJ Lethal]  "Run-D.M.C. and Jam Master Jay"
[Fred Durst] It's like that y'all ("And the beat goes on")
             It's like that y'all
             It's like that and a that
             Like that y'all ("And the beat goes on")
[DJ Lethal]  "Yeah, Run-D.M.C. and Jam Master Jay"
[Fred Durst] It's like that y'all ("And the beat goes on")
             It's like that y'all
             It's like that and a that
             Like that y'all ("And the beat goes on")
[DJ Lethal]  "Run-D.M.C. and Jam Master Jay"
[Fred Durst] It's like that y'all ("And the beat goes on")
             It's like that y'all
             It's like that and a that
             Like that y'all ("And the beat goes on")
