[Big Gemini]
Yeah
Sometimes

Chorus: Big Gemini
Sometimes, I
Wish I could
Go back and make things all good
But I can't, you can't, nobody can
I hope God forgives what I became
I'm a monster, can't stand my reflection
I hate everything that I stand for
Everyone 'round me
Wants me dead also
Go ahead
Pull it, motherfucker, you know that I'm a see you in
Hell

(Verse 1)
That's what he said with his last breath
Nine millimeter to the back of his neck
For a moment, he was stoned, couldn't believe what he had done
But finally, did exactly what he dreamt for so long
A feeling of relief shot through his whole body
People runnin' and screamin', "Oh my God, he shot him!"
He ain't budge, he just stood there
Tears in his eyes
Lookin' like he was frozen in time
And all in his mind, it was his childhood years replayed
And the dirt that he did through his teenage days
The monster in his nightmares have finally been slayed
And now, would no longer could say

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 2)
It was 1989
A little man, shit
He barely was five
He just started kindergarten
Said he loves school
He-Mans was his favorite, G.I. Joes was cool
Used to play with the kids in the neighborhood
He didn't know there was a monster that lurked in the hood
That also like to play with little boys and girls
That would take their innocence and
Shatter they worlds
And one day
He found out
That monsters do exist
And this would haunt him everyday, for as long as he lived
See, this child was molested by a grown ass man
A pedophile, a monster
That's better off dead
Never let nobody know, he just kept it inside
And blamed that man for everything bad he had in his life
The monster in his nightmares have finally been slayed
And now, would no longer could say

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 3)
What you just heard was a story
Based upon truth
And who the story is based on wished he could do
I saw the pain that you hide as it leaked from your eyes
Runnin' down your cheeks, I never seen you cry
And I can't even imagine what the fuck you went through
And hope you ain't mad that I wrote this for you
Believe me when I say, "It's not your fault"
It isn't
It's not your fault
It ain't

Outro: Big Gemini
Sometimes, I
Wish I could
Go back and make things all good
But I can't, you can't, nobody can
Hope he burns in hell for what he did
He's a monster that preys on the children
For that, he should ride up in prison
And if the day comes
We should find out
Where he lives
And we gon' go there and know that we gon' send him to
Hell
