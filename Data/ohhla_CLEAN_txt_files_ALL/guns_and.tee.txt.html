[T.I.]
Ay have you ever loved somebody
so much you can't stand 'em but can't be without 'em?
Do anything for 'em cause you truly do adore 'em
Like dedicate songs, write poems
But they be on that bullshit and you try to ignore 'em
But you feel like they feel like you ain't right for 'em
Therefore your heart's torn
Between bein with 'em forever, leavin them never
But it seem like you arguin, fightin over whatever
Maybe we can leave, find someone better
Even though you know you've never known none better
My heart say "Nah, she can't leave, won't let her"
Been head over heels since the very day I met her
Fell so deep in love I ain't been able to get up
Sometimes I want some peace of mind and she don't shut up
Love her to death, don't know whether to kiss her or kill her

[Chorus: P!nk]
Should've known it, from the start it was already over
We were just too dumb to notice
And we'd pray but, even love couldn't save us
We'd wake up - on a bed of guns and roses
And we don't knowwwww which one to choose
When, either wayyyyy we're gonna lose
Still we'd pray but, even love couldn't save us
We'd wake up - on a bed of guns and roses

[T.I.]
Huh, I guess I'd rather suffer with her than be miserable without her
I buy a lot of Prada, Gucci and Balenciaga
to keep her content and keep down the nonsense
But every corner we turn around the conflict
Mostly dumb shit, like who she run with
"Where the fuck you been? Them pants they don't fit"
Really, honestly speakin some things I don't get
And no matter how much she try she can't make it make more sense
Therefore, here we go again
Screamin, yellin at the top of our lungs, she goin in
Sayin the kind of shit, I be like "If you was a man
I would go in yo' shit, for real, no shit"
But I love her so much that I can't forget
that the feel of a kiss, it could heal when I'm sick
Still, I don't like to feel like this
If I wouldn't miss her I would probably get her killed right quick

[Chorus]

[P!nk]
Every time we say our good-byyyyyyes
A little piece of my heart breaks off insiiiiiide
I don't really ever know whyyyyyyyy
If I could live without you I'd try-IYYYYYYYY!

[Chorus] w/ ad libs</pre>
