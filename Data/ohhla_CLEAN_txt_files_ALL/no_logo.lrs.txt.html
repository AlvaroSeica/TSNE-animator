Album:  This Gigantic Robot Kills
Song:   No Logo
Typed by: @mc_lars (Horris Records)

LARS:
Straight up  I'm an anarchist  politically extreme
You'll find me down at Kinko's printing anti-corporate zines
My stencil graffiti is rebellious and defiant
Nothing says revolution like Andre the Giant
JESSE:
You know the science on the Mayans and twenty-twelve, with
Government thugs covering up, lizard people with many selves
Voting is collaborating, only thing I'm advocating
Is raising awareness of my awareness and self-congratulating
LARS:
Starbucks is the devil, Adbusters told me so
I wear my Che Guevera shirt to subvert the status quo
The government is lying to you and me
Bush knocked down the towers, literally
JESSE:
Yeah he strapped himself with C4 and piloted two planes
Like Bill Pullman in ID4, bootlegged as Loose Change
Who's sane when you claim he didn't plan it with Hussein?
They're one crew signed to different labels, like Wu-Tang

Chorus
LARS:
I've got Naomi Klein on my mind (No Logo)
Read her whole book because she's fine (No Logo)
You'll find me down at Wal-Mart with an anarchy sign
Because dude, it's a fricking anarchy sign! (No Logo)
JESSE:
I'm not racist, you're sensitive, geez (no logo)
Frankly, racism has poor brand identity (no logo)
I'm saying though, I don't see color, we're all the same, bro
Like one big rainbow (No homo! and stop)

Verse 2:
LARS:
Because Mom and Dad tried to hold me back (back)
Suburban America is not where it's at (at)
I bought a Noam Chomsky book with my Dad's credit card (irony)
Became an expert on world politics  it wasn't that hard
JESSE:
Now I haven't read Howard Zinn, but I'm sure he'd agree with me
That power's influence can be seen most egregiously
To corrupt, you super-suckers pay your taxes, follow all their
Laws I'm taking down the system with my blog
LARS:
Are you part of the problem or part of the solution?
I climb overpasses, spray painted Stop the pollution
I've been to hell I spell it, I spell it DMV
Pay my taxes the last minute intentionally (what!)
JESSE:
And eventually, you conventional sheep will see that it's meant to be
That man's emancipation from lands and nations take place in this century
Naturally, very little will actually change politically
Except we'll all just do whatever we want me, specifically

Chorus
LARS:
Check my iPod and you'll see (No Logo)
I only download indie label CDs (No Logo)
Bought a Banksy print on eBay on Buy Nothing Day
Just to stick it the man ironically (No Logo)
JESSE:
Governments have outlived their usefulness (no logo)
You sheeple just aren't ready for my truthfulness (no logo)
It's my god-given right as an American to speak as I please
Love it or leave it, this is freedom at its gruesomest (no logo)
or leave it, This is freedom at its gruesomest (No Logo)

LARS:
It's the N-O-L to the O-G-O
The N-O-L to the O-G-O
The N-O-L to the O-G-O
The N-O-L to the O-G-O

JESSE: Barack Hussein? Hillary Banks? Ed McCain?
Three sides of the same coin as far as I'm concerned!
If I can't smoke a doob on a airplane and talk to bitches however
I want, the real terrorists have already won or did they?

And stop! Yeah! And stop

Stop exploiting independent musicians mainstream America
This is a song for you. It's from the heart
Get off our Ds. And by that I mean the D batteries we have to buy
to pay to fuel our studios

Peace!

No Logo and stop</pre>
