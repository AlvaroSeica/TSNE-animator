[Pharoahe Monch]
(We must be in love)
(We must be in love)
(We must be in...)

It's soul music
Soully for ya soul music
For it matter how much we all soul music
From ya fitted to ya Nike soul music
It's cheese grits and filet a soul music
This soul music sound good don't it

I got a message that I might wanna share with you
To show you I'm hard at
It beats the president and his government
I voted for God
And I know some how some way we all can make it
I got a little information might as well a go ahead and take it

(We must be in love)
If fovever we gon talk the talk we gotta walk the walk
(We must be in love)
From the coast of California all the way down to the shores of New York
(We must be in love)
I know some how some way we all can make it
(We must be in love)
I got a little information might as well a go ahead and take it

(We must be in)
Open your heart I'm sure you'll find a way to truly get this
To cure a man from all his disease and from all his sickness
One life one love one fight one struggle one blood
Hope you can feel it in your bones
and if you need it you can use it any time of day you want it you can choose it hey
In the morning in the evening
If you work a 9 to 5 then you leavin
You can stand on the train when you reading
(We must be in love)
Love music gospel to thug music
Some inspire the soul when they write some abuse it
I choose to choose what I choose when I choose it
Put love in the music cause

(We must be in love)
If fovever we gon talk the talk we gotta walk the walk
(We must be in love)
From the coast of California all the way down to the shores of New York
(We must be in love)
I know some how some way we all can make it
(We must be in love)
I got a little information might as well a go ahead and take it

(We must be in love)

Lord
I know somebody in here feel the love tonight
Please
If you can feel it in your soul and your spirit let me see one hands in the air
Now turn to the person to the right of you and you can tell them
You can tell them
You can say it

(*We must be in love, we must be in love*)
