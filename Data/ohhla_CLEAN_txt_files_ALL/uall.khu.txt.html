[Ad-libs]
Yeah
On this one we gonna get a little crowd participation on this one right here
Y'all just repeat it before right here

[Chorus: repeat 4X]
You already know, know, know, know
You already slow

[Verse 1]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, come on, come on
Privilege abuser
Land cruiser
Ten time loser
First offender
No surrender, down
Wherever we don't surrender no charity
Orchestrating me and a nigga off sales
Vinyl, satisfaction guaranteed
'Jo Goodie stampede on Balboa
You Apollo king
I may look like a rapper but I'm a known clapper
Cleaning out your stash
Slanging hot brass
In a class, all by myself
You slept, I stayed awake
Goodie niggaz have the spirit of a snake
Bro got it like chin check
D.F., here to stay
Like love and hate
I'm on your plate
Eating every crumb
Cause I don't have none

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, come on, come on
This Khujo "Gun Club" Goodie at your service
I specialize in whacking bosses and they surface
Ain't no rules or parameters
Professional, we pity the amateur
'Bout time I get some cunk, fifty might some slug
In my cross bugs
Ain't here to assassinate your character more like erase ya
From paper
Whenever there's a problem with troublemakers
Certified hitman
Ain't no store pipe paid
Blacktalians
Rhinos
Don't waste your fare on anybody armor cause I'm a bomb 'em
Yeah, yeah, you already know

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, come on, come on
Capital K H, U, J, O
One more for the G, double O
D-I-E, M, to the O
Check the stats that pulled your credentials
Pow!
Nobody now
Who's that peaking in my window?
Dirty South!
Boy, with a plate of this old-fashioned Soul Food all we did was dis dude
Nigga, ain't nobody changing
This my Attic cause Twayne hooked up with Armstrong this game in trouble
Yah! I'm the scoop that sat beside the double doors and let in all the bros
It's you and I done forgot about the struggle
In the corner swinging like aluminum loaded slugs
Focused next on your jugular

[Chorus

Yeah, yeah, yeah, come, come on</pre>
