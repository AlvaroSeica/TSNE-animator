[Chorus: Apocalipps]
I don't care if you thugging or not
I'll have a thorough nigga run in yo spot (Iron Mic)
Let me find out you talking to cops
To find your body with ya dick in ya butt (biatch)
Son, really think that's it's sweet, but it's not
We had to struggle just to get to the top (oh no)
Ruthless and we making it hot
You know my gun holds sixteen shots, get popped

[Apocalipps]
I spaz out on tracks, they say I'm too jailed out
And I, wild in clubs like I just got bailed out
Just yesterday, I was up north with Black Tails beating my dick
But now I'm home spitting heat with my click
And ya'll seem to forget, that I'm the one that give it up, give lumps
Turn it up, twist skunk, all my niggas get crunked
If it's beef, I just creep to the back of the trunk
Spinner hit you in yo back with the pump
You got tore up, because you like showing ya ass
Now you in the hospital with a robe, that be showing ya ass
I got more in my glass, we only talk over the cash
Play this loud in yo whip, and your rover gon' crash
Get open off grass, sticky green stuck in the dash
I'm on parole, you see the po', hit the clutch and the gas
And get out of here fast, mami won the backstage pass
She said she fuck a stallion plus stick dick in her ass
We had to breeze off, cuz shorty leaked spaghetti sauce
I like ready drawers, I run through bitches like Eddie George
That's a petty cause, go against Lipps, bet he fall
All my niggas got dead arms, they ready to store

[Chorus]

[Iron Mic]
You muthafuckas thought you wasn't gonna see us
His funeral arrange was made, when we bust, we coming like Jesus
I spit the facts, ya'll best bet is believe us
Radiator gats, we stay with them heaters
Rhymes for days, nines that blaze, for cats
Who be acting strange, don't make me tie up the braids
Throw on a mask, murder ya ass, my burners'll blast
I burn for the cash, we ain't concerned with ya past
We straight wilding, you hiding when them gats is firing
All I know is rap and crack supplying
All I know, when there's drama, we be acting violent
Guns'll clap on you, leave you silent, nigga
Nothing but jukses, guns, crack, weed and dice
And we are number one, don't believe the hype
The four's blazing, dough chasing, these niggas is mad hating
I keep the pump like I work at the gas station
Matter fact, we dump like we work at the sanitation
Ya'll niggas is faking, get popped like bacon
Shutting down ya whole show, nigga, drop ya rating
Stop complaining, show you what the glock containing
Sixteen, hollow tip shots, rock ya face in
Stand up nigga, let me show you what you facing
Ruthless, bout to take over the fucking nation
Iron Mic ain't playing, my gun is blazing, homey

[Chorus]

[Apocalipps]
I read the Art of War, then I paint the art of war
A potrait in the frame, showing ya brains on the floor
Like 48 laws, I son you when I give you these chores
Put in that work, hold this 'fore I run to your drawers

[Iron Mic]
Yo, when I grab the microphone it's war, I spit raw
Authentic street hip hop, crack ya jaw
Pass the four, I ain't 'fraid to blast the four
He only real, til the shots, cuz he was ass in drawers

[Apocalipps]
Eight in the dash, I was speeding in the range when I crashed
And you, dick in the butt niggas is pains in the ass
Youse is soft, nigga, all these Coupes is bought
I shove ya brain in ya ass, and make you booth ya thoughts
Then shit out ya mind, don't make me get out the nine
And hit the first jack dash that try to get out of line
I'm staying alive, like Boogie Nights, I'm staying alive
Cuz if you beef, I'mma spray the calico with your five
And holy your whip, somebody should of told you it's Lipps
Now I'mma bury you alive and leave you lonely with ticks
Maggots and bugs, gon' eat through your casket like grub
And lord forgive you for your sins, for trying to act like a thug

[Iron Mic]
Man, I'm a street nigga, I ain't no rapper
So you better keep ya gat, muthafucka, it's not hard to get atcha
Forget having sex, nine'll undress you faster
Don't worry bout me, I won't kill you unless I have to
You punk muthafuckas know what I'm after
Don't make me send those boys to your crib, picking up your matress
Told you before, not to fuck with them Bastardz
Now I gotta show you how to do this son, pick up the ratchet
And make that boy mama pick up his casket
And pardon me for being so hard, but when I spit it, it's classic
I'm Iron Mic, nigga, but call me cactus
Cuz when I stick, if you resist, nigga, you will get blasted
