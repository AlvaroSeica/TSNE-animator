[Chorus: Sung by Askari X]
I am not Tippy Toe Soldier
I am the bald headed Muslim
I am not Tippy Toe Soldier
I am the bald headed Muslim

[Verse 1]
In the year of our Lord, on the sixth day of the third month
a black brother emerged from the womb of his mother
From out of the Tripple darkness a baby girl into the darkness of the Devil world
I was born prematurely the doctor said i wasn't gonna live for surely
Allah controls this show written in the scrolls of 50 g's
I was told that I was prophesized to be concieved
My mother birthed a bastard laid me in a manger the man you call Jesus was an example
My life was in danger, the King tried to kill me brother
Givin' birth control pills to my mother
Its all symbolically a picture, Science and Mathematics of the black Asiatic scripture
666, I curse the Devil whiteman and his crews
as they rowed me to my death at the bottom of a ship
Cause I was put in a Cross-a-fix by them jews
And because of that cross I was lost for 90 days
Headin' for the west and the wicked ways
Of the beast who was the Preist of Babylon
Who rose up out the sea to decieve me and carry on the works of the dragon
Who chased the woman in the book of Revelations
The black nation is that child that was called unto
God and prophesized to rule all nations with an iron rod

So let those with ears hear what the spirit told you through me and I be Askari

(Chorus)
I am not Tippy Toe Soldier
I am the bald headed Muslim
I am not Tippy Toe Soldier
I am the bald headed Muslim
Stolen from Afrika
Brought to America
Eh, Fighting on arrival
We was fighting for survival

(Verse 2)
Now you gon' see a dark cloud and its spreadin' a mile around the city
Its time for Armaggedon!
I thought you brothers knew everything is real
Elijah spoke true prophecy being fulfilled
Mathematically 19 is the time Allah completes add 96 and that's completion of the beast
But you can't dig it
Is it that you brothers still sleep to the fact that
Allah's back to gather up his sheep?
So peep, the science of destruction
Mathematically computer to come to pass in the last
Stages of the pages in the book that was written 50 thousand years ago by us but it was hidden
From the sight of men so that the Djinn would think of rule
So they was kicked out of Heaven onto earth to lead the fools
That will follow them out of the knowledge of themselves
to the cross for them devils crucified me slave for sale
They put a crown of thorns on my head when they took me
Which symbolized confusion for I thought my God forsook me
3 times 30 days they had me chained up in that cross
On that cross I gave my spirit up which in truth means I was lost and ressurected

Let those with ears hear what the spirit told you through me and I be Askari

(Chorus)
I am not Tippy Toe Soldier
I am the bald headed Muslim
I am not Tippy Toe Soldier
I am the bald headed Muslim
Stolen from Afrika
Brought to America
Eh, Fighting on arrival
We was fighting for survival

Bung-bung de de boy
Bung-bung de de boy, bing bing
Bung-bung bu ding bung.What a ding
What a dang
What a ding

Cracka peep the game that I'm spittin'
I'm on the for realla peckerwoods no I ain't bullshittin'
You ain't got no more love here
After 400 years and tears you ain't pumpin' no more fear
In the hearts of the lost but now found members of the Holy Tribe
But no longer sleeping gods
Up on yo game cave skunk
That's why the ball head man is here to bring the funk
Down on yo ass cause you nothing but a beast
We won't have peace until yo ass is deceased
Cause its been shown that you wicked to the bone
You know the funk is on
That's why you tryna move to the moon
Cause real soon the fire's gonna koom, fire koom
With a boom and you know yo ass is doomed!
To the tomb with yo cave bitch
Givin' up her pussy to the dogs like a savage
Yo ass is grass yo six days been over
We no longer sleep to the fact that we the owner
The greater taker, the blackman is the maker of the devil snaking
called 'em Satan put the god to sleep but i've awakened
I was so lost but now I'm found I was so blind but now I see and I be Askari

[Chorus]
I am not Tippy Toe Soldier
I am the bald headed Muslim
I am not Tippy Toe Soldier
I am the bald headed Muslim
Stolen from Afrika
Brought to America
Eh, Fighting on arrival
I was fighting for survival

Bung-bung de de boy

Bung-bung bu ding bung.What a ding
