[Trey Songz]
It's still ringing in my ear
You screamin' "I don't care"
And I can see it like it just went down
Me walking out of there
I still see 'em on your face baby
So many tears
And I remember feeling like im bout to explode
I gotta get out of here

[Chorus One]
It's like my sun won't shine
It's like my ride don't roll
It's like the only one thing I love
Dont love me no more
It's like my right gone wrong
It's like my ice gone warm
It's like the only one thing I love
Dont love me no more

[Chorus Two]
If I hadn't just slacked up on my pimping
You'd be here with me
If I'd a stayed instead of dipping
You'd be here with me
If I'd a prayed instead of wishing
You'd still be here with me
But all the ifs in the world won't bring you back again

[Trey Songz]
I wish that I could run that back
But in life you can't press rewind
'Cause the only way to fix this thang
Is to go back in time
'Cause if I had my way
Yesterday would be right now
Instead of fighting we'd be making love
Until the sun go down

[Chorus One] + [Chorus Two] 2X

[Trey Songz]
If I could just hold my shawty
If I could kiss my shawty
If I could get my shawty back
If I could just see you baby
If we could talk then baby
I would have my lady back

[Chorus Two] + [Chorus One]</pre>
