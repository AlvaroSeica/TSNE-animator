[Skylar Johnson]
Well my tab {?} comin too
I talk of you, I always knew
'Bout what to do, 'bout nothin nothin to prove
Something is true, dude I promise
Sweet dread, is the biobonics
And your peeps? They're with the phonics
And anything I want I lease them artist
With the street, it's the drivehearted

Screw a stadium set, give me a ball
with a hundred heads who know what good lyrics are
Food for the spirit - it's called verbal vernacular
That can get you actually far
but won't give me actual scars
Feelings that morph into words you hear
after I record my part
It's called ART!

I'm an artist, with an inch to lose
My list of parts, consists of two
A diss to you, listen dude
If you ain't still listenin - COOL~!
Simple, trash, psychoplastic
Afro styles you pipe in stagnant
Static voids, tragic noids
With door to pour into an addict's void
The addicts, confuse the words
Synapses, get fused and turned
Hears one used but he usually heard
the bridges, that I choose to burn
Styles (WORD) me playin
It's (WORD) I'm mean layin
Pull your rap you used to earn and learn
it's a movement move to learn

Screw a Palladium rap, give me a car
Where the head daps, with a kitten purse star
Rides for the marks, videos spectular
Whips for Dunns will actually get me far
But I want a whip that'll give my back a scar
Pain that pours in the verse
After I record my part
It's called ART!</pre>
