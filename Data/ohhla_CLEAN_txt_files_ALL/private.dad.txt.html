My passion for money and women 
is everlastin aint no limit to how much we spendin
aint it fantastic but my champion so high in the club (you see her)
I pay with plastic you not just a stripper my love
you my actress see the fire in your eyes
mouth to mouth before I let this desire die
bag of money just to relocate it to the sky
like a condominium for c-notes to reside I think I'm feelin high
 
(Diddy)

and you look like an entertainer
