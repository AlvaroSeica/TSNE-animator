Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I went to that corner store to
Get something to eat
Well I hear old nico
Straight come callin' after me
He says now
Son you've got to listen
And I hope you understand
That we've
Got the best tortillas
And that aint no bullshit man
So don't go waste you money
On somebody else
Come callin' after me

Listen to my story
Said it's
Standin' oh so true
Well my baby's left me
Said you know I'm feelin' blue
But now i'm
Waitin'and I'm callin'
By my telephone
And if my baby don't come rockin'
Then you know
I'll be alone
Cause my baby's
Gone and left me
For some stoopid ass mutherfucker
Now she's gone
Well my baby's gone and left me
For some stoopid ass mutherfucker
Now she's gone</pre>
