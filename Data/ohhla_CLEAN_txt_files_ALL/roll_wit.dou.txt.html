[Hook - 2x]
Said I'm feeling you girl, you need to roll with me
Said I'm feeling you girl, you look good on the side of me
(said I'm feeling you boy, you need to roll with me
Said I'm feeling you boy, you look good when you ride with me)

[Tiffany]
It's the T-I double F, up in this bitch
We can jump in your truck, with them 23's let 'em spin
Let me light up your weed, baby girl is a G
Who gon do it the way I do it, nobody baby
Tiffany hold it down, bitch I'm up on my shine
You hustling for nothing ass niggaz, ain't on my mind
I'ma keep swinging wide, black on black shiny tires
You hold your own and clock your do', then you prolly can ride

[Dougie D]
Ok now look boo I feel your style, the way you walk the way you smile
The way you talk the way you slide, the way you move the way you shine
Jump in the LTB, mama won't you come and take a ride with a G
Shit it's all good to the game with the D
we could hit the mall and take a shopping spree
What you want the Prada shoes purse and the hat
we could get the Vickie pants and a bra to match
Let a nigga touch you in the middle where it's wet
I just wanna see the pretty pinky from the back
Let a nigga hit it till it hurts so good
pop another X and give it two more uh's
You the kinda shorty that a nigga freak for
you the kinda shorty that's a real keeper

[Shano]
It's the Shano up in the do', looking so fly
When you got me on the passenger side, you look so live
Fuck it I'll even drive, let you sit back and ride
Po' up them cups with that pine, on the South it's going down
Now how they wanna act, they see us shining having thangs
These hoes be mad at Ms. Thang, cause Ms. Thang up on her game
Diamonds in every ring, I stay Vickie fitted and jazzy
Gangsta but still a lady, don't get your shit twisted backwards
