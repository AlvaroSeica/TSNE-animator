[ScholarMan]
Get back, prepared with a sick rap
Fixed cap, the new king is here and fat
And truth of the spiritual feelin that gives you goosebumps
I'm more equipped in the game than all these new chumps
Enter the Matrix, brainwashed, complacent
Freedom of speech they remove but your taste it
Plead your case with beats banged in basement
Golden, era is what this is laced with
Tired of fake shit, they call me a complainer
I cain't help it radio don't play bangers
They play generic shit, my music fearin it
I might actually free mines, you hearin it
Nah they busy sleepin it's your wake-up call
Let's stop bitchin get the makeup off
And make good music, you gotta feel it doe
Like Naughty By Nature, yes, "Feel Me Flow"

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
If you feelin this track, then put your hands up
We all agree that hip-hop's the answer
Tell your friends and them we movin like a pendulum
Longevity trials I'm never endin them

[ScholarMan]
Skills no question required for this profession
The issues I'm addressin the truth no second-guessin
Analyze these guys they lies proven
GameShift: The Movement they watchin o' what we doin
Freedom we pursuin every night brothers shootin
Tryin to protect they wealth, the law cruisin
To meet the quota yes another cat is locked up
Streetsweeper is comin to clean the block up
Hood warfare, yes we should all care
Fight for the cause until we get it all fair
Civil rights, I write to shed light
Most politicians are gettin in bed tight
with the lobbyists and the things is obvious
We need a frontline of lyrical warriors
Lyrical ammunition, we gotta plan the mission
Unify move the liars understand the vision

[Chorus] - 1.5X</pre>
