[Marty James]
Elll Layyy!
Sunset Boulevard, Pacific Hiiiighway
Out to the Walk of Stars now you in Ca-layyyyy
Don't go 'less you go hard; go 'less you go hard
Hol-ly-wooood!
Downtown and back life is always good
It's not an act we so fresh, so hood (it won't stop)
You knew that it never would; knew that it never would

[Snoop Dogg]
Mmm! Lakers, Dodgers, Ducks, Kings
Angels, Clippers, real set trippers
Clarified ride we bonafide, dippers
ESPN you know, SportsCenter
Spooned and groomed, dipped and whipped
Home of the NBA championship
Purple and gold, homie let the story be told
It's the city where you shoot your favorite television episode
And you can hit the Strip, Sunset Boulevard
But you gotta have a lowrider car
With the skirts draggin, with the plaque in the back flaggin
Or put it in the back of the Chevy wagon
That's how we represent it though
Birthplace of Chevrolet sixty-fo'
Yeah, I love showin you that
First things first my nig' you better know where you at
You in

[Chorus]

[Marty James]
Ridin on the 405
On my way to pick up baby
Eighty-five in the winter time
Man, this place is crazy
I love it, love it, love it, love it
Southern surfer Cali

[Snoop Doog]
Rollin down Fairfax, just left the Nico
Bust a left turn on Pico
Gotta see the Bishop, he got me some gator shoes
I'm rollin to Hollywood, I'm doin the House of Blues
About nine o'clock, stop by the record shop
And get that new Snoop Dogg, now we bounce and ball
Life is a mystery, my life is like history
Stop by my dispensary
And get me some kush and push out
Put it in the trunk, smellin like a skunk
But it's all legal in L.A., everybody takin a hit
From the politicians to athletes and even the teachers
My dentist even hit it, Dr. Beecher
He say "Snoop Dogg I really wanna meet ya"
Yeah, I love showin you that
First things first, my nig' you better know where you at
You in

[Chorus]

[Marty James]
Elll Layyy!</pre>
