VERSE 1

Yo, there's Aamon and Abaddon
and Ekimmu from babylon 
Pazuzu was sumerian and fought against the Metatron 
theres Abalam and Alawar and Azazel the Canaanite
Mephostopheles was humanoid and known to fly at night
Agrat Bat Mahlat was one of satan's wives 
go head and call him Azriel its Beelzebub that rules the flies
when skimming through the alphabet of demons you see Baphomet
Dantalion's with Solomon reclaiming all his pieces bet
Set is the demon of storms you see
evil is evil and takes different forms believe 
you me there was Astaroth the ugly 
and Belphegum the moabite diseased his skin was bubbly
but the biggest one is Lucifer the morning star
the enemy the tempter the accuser 
come to lay the law
he came to legions of this evil 
hes the prince of the earth 
unleased a couple demons but the angels
where there first

HOOK (2x)
angels &amp; demons are living among us
angels &amp; demons assemble in numbers
demons and angels they been here forever
flame to they halos the Ebekenezer 

VERSE 2

you heard about the demons 
now its time to mention angels 
the Cherubim the Nephilim the ones who wear the halos
theres Camael and Cassiel ,Elijah and theres Raphael 
and Michael whos the total opposite of angel Samael
theres Israfel whos musical and Adonai whos Elohim 
and Mitatron who gets it on and talks to you at night in dreams
Nathaniel always hiding things
and Cassiel's in seventh heaven
when your born its Layla who protects your mom 
and saves your melon
Rachmiel is merciful and Rachiel is sexual
this track was made for hip hop geniuses and intellectuals
Cathetel protects the vegetables and Duma's silent
know this well that Jophiel's the angel of enlightenment 
Uzziel is faithful up in space i pray to Forfax
Zuphlas is the angel of trees 
so we pray to him for more sacks 
got to end this with a 
chitty bang a lang a dang a diggy dang
these angels coexist with man its all part 
of a bigger plan

HOOK (2X)

VERSE 3

we are the son of man the model of perfection
appointed guardian angels at our birth for our protection
according to the romans satan wanted his revenge 
because Abdiel defeated him and cast out all his friends
and the lord said unto them that by the blood of slaughtered lambs
that they lost they place in heaven 
so in turn they torment man
in the bible in the torah and koran they have they mentions
in reality they holding on and molding this dimension
so just follow intuition
quietly you feel there essence
this is just an invocation
i get goose bumps in they're presence
there is darkness there is light
there is day and there is night 
as vibrations tickle frequencies 
i never trust my sight
keep walking toward the light 
the stench of sulphur 
nearly chokes you 
its the devil playing tricks, training the demons so they coax you
theres a battle taking place 
we the people are the prize 
bite the apple have a taste 
watchful are my fathers eyes
