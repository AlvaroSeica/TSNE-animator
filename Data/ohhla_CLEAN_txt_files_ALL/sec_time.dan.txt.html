[Verse 1]
It's 10:00 on Friday
I'm 'bout to hit the highway
I got my pistol just in case somebody wanna try me
I'm headed to the club
So I can get messed up
I'm gonna holla at the chickenheads and press my luck
I've gotta freshen up
Oh, snap! Look at Danny
Daps, smiles, Black &amp; Milds
Everybody actin' wild
And rowdy in the parking lot
All it's gonna take for me
Is two swigs of Armadale to get this fuckin' party hot
Whoever wanna see ID
Get popped up in their E-Y-E
I'm just trying to have a little fun up in the V.I.P.
These strippers gettin' restless
They wanna hold my necklace
They wanna dance around a pole for me and get butt naked
And I don't mind at all
Final call for alcohol
Wylin' out, cocky like I had a hundred thousand balls
It's, time to get it pumpin'
Listen to the music bumpin'
Club packed, dub sack
I'm gon' make you love this track, c'mon

[Chorus] - 2X
We at the club tonight
We'll make you feel all right
This is the second time
And we gon' do things right
We came to claim the crown
We 'bout to lay shit down
Because (this time, we)
We almost made it now

[Verse 2]
One Mississippi
And two Mississippi
By the time we get to ten, we gon' all be real tipsy
When I sip up on the Crissy
Ditzy bitches lookin' pretty
Liquor got me +So Gone+ like, Monica and Missy
I'm about to roll the sticky but
Oh, snap! Look at shawty
She got the tongue ring gleamin' like it's looking for me
I'm 'bout to spit some game
Grey Goose the one to blame
I ain't gon' leave this muthafucka 'til I get some brain
Hey shawty, what's your name?
"Candy Cane!"
Perfect; with a name like that I KNOW you can work it
Twerk it, put it in your mouth, don't hurt it
Like you're supposed ta
Girl you gotta work hard for a damn Danny poster
Posted up, with a case of vodka
Pimped out like steak and lobster
I do my dirt and then forget it 'til the cases pop up
Stay lookin' proper you can catch me dressed to def
With my waves, Timbs
Grey Benz
I'm gon' make you dance, c'mon c'mon

[Chorus] - 2X</pre>
