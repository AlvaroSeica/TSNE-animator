Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Chorus: Nice &amp; Smooth]
I think you better let it go, I think you better let it go
I think you better let it go, I think you better let it go
I think you better let it go, I think you better..
I think you better let it go, I think you better let it go
I think you better (let it go) I think you better let it go
I think you better let it go (let it go)

[Greg Nice]
My heart be achin, it felt like Mike caved me in the chest
My girlfriend takin me through so much stress (uh)
Takin me through all kind of love contest
In my bird nest

[Smooth B]
As a youngster, the old timer told me
Never let the worries of women, control me
Think sharp, use precision
Never look back when you make your decision

[Greg Nice]
I took you out, to see the Island
Drop top style, profilin
When I had it, you knew you got it
Now I don't, so what about it?
Are you down with me, I doubt it
Relationship re-routed

[Chorus: Nice &amp; Smooth]
I think I better let it go, I think I better let it go
I think I better let it go, I think I better let it go
I think I better let it go, I think I better let it go
I think I better let it go, I think I better let it go
I think I better let it go

[Smooth B]
Is love really blind?
Or do we fail to see when it sneaks from behind
I know a player nearly lost his mind
Felt his main girl was freakin, but couldn't catch her
One day, while coolin with the crew
There she was swingin low, in Club Esso
He called me up said Smooth now I know
Tell me what to do - I told him let it go

[Chorus: Nice &amp; Smooth]
I think you better let it go, I think you better let it go, let it go
I think you better let it go, I think you better let it go, let it go
I think you better let it go, I think you better let it go, let it go
I think you better let it go, I think you better let it go, let it go

[Greg Nice]
Nerve of you!  Beatin them kids
Nervous breakdown, flipped yo' lid
Hittin the pipe, look what'chu done did
Failed to realize we all been kids
Tired of the baby screamin
Tired of the baby's cryin, boyfriend lyin
Reach deep inside girlfriend and keep tryin
Stop kids from dyin.. (stop kids from dyin..)

[over instrumental silence]
I think I better let it go, I think I better let it go
I think I better let it go, I think I better let it go
I think I better let it go, let it go

[Outro: Nice &amp; Smooth]
I think I better let it go, I think I better let it go
I think I better let it go, I think I better let it go, let it go</pre>
