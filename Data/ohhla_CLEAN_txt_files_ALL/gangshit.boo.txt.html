[Verse One]
if you ain't heard I'm Lil' Boosie who be rappin bout that gangsta shit
aint satisfied unless I'm high and my bank get thick
I'm the most underestimated rapper walkin the streets
niggaz on videos with money but can't talk it like me
cause they ain't sour like me
shit in two seconds you down
my first album ain't no joke
how would you think my second would sound
hope to make it in this rap game I gotta get rich
go to gin and juice and henny to a bottle of chrys
put yo fo's up in the sky if you feelin my rhymes
might be local for now but I'm still gone shine
put my doggs on Garfield who told me don't stop
keep rappin and that's whats happin and for sho you gone pop
so I kept my head up and spoke the real from the heart
fuck around you will get down thank I'm still a lil boy
you got another thang comin you ain't fuckin wit no hoe or no woman
and fo down is the hood I'm from

[Chorus: repeat 4X]
if you ain't heard I'm Lil boosie who be rappin bout that gangsta shit
nigga I'm bout that gangsta shit

[Second Verse]
niggaz getting the picture but don't want to put me in the frame it's a shame
I rap harder than any nigga you name
from weed to caine I distributed all
and for everybody who want see Lil' Boosie fall man fuck yall
and throw up chain defenses
I'll go off like I'm Caine in Menace
listen nigga I ain't finish
look you niggaz smiling in my face you ain't my round
I'll put that fuckin iron up in your face and lay you down
I'm thuggin nigga
I gotta Firebird and a cutlass nigga
and that whole south gone ride if you touch it nigga
now lets go hop up in the bucket nigga lets get high as the fuck
show this nigga the consequences for drivin his nuts
I need a fifth of Mad Dog cause I'm finna act dog
show this nigga how we livin cross the track dog
you better back off or I'ma hit this nigga with this hot shit
just sit back and watch this

[Chorus: repeat 4X]

[Verse three]
well it don't get mo' gangsta, gangsta than that nigga Lil B
runnin raps that fuck yo head up and still flippin that d
you gone need a navy of niggaz you play with me nigga
plus I got a black nine beam and it stay wit me nigga
what yall know about them fo's
if we can't put it on the map
we finna put it on the globe (whoa)
call the coroner nigga I'm warnin you nigga
I ain't fearin none of you niggaz I dump on you niggaz
you fuckin wit a cave man I might be small but I'm brave man
in yo lap I'll have yo head layin
you fuckin with a mastermind ain't gone be too many after mine
cause they can't rap it how I'm rappin mine
shit lets go hop up in the ?Booneville? show those dummies its real
all these bullets in this chopper how no one get killed
nigga I'm bout that gangsta shit
and fuck every nigga who say I ain't the shit

[Chorus: repeat 'til song ends]</pre>
