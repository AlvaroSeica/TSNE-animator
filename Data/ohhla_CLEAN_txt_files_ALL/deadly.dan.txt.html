[Chorus]
Deadly!
Whenever he flowin', body counts are growin'
Please stay away cuz you know the nigga's deadly!
Got your body burnin', there's nowhere to turn when
He's on the mic, cuz you know the nigga's deadly!
Have you ever heard of, major mass murder?
That's what he does, lyrically the nigga's deadly!
Cuz he has no equal, run go tell your people
Protect yourself!

Raps we load in tracks, pack kilos of wax
Whack weak bros with that, gats reload with phat
Flows tighter than your Speedos, harder than some steel toes
And nastier than dudes using dildos
Everyday my skill grows to give ya heart attacks
Even party raps corner cats in my slaughter shack
Flow nicer than whatever your local bar may got on tap
More times than more times is mentioned in Kardi's track
Now the cards are stacked, if you wanna fuss, it's on!
Me not rhyming's like eliminating lust from porn
I bust with scorn to crush your whole's junction's form
You're more pussy than Cheech Marin in From Dusk Till Dawn
If you're a black pussy, white pussy, Indian pussy
I swear on mics a nagging sumo wrestler couldn't push me
I'm colder than the rudest skeef you know who is stush be
Rip off your tushie and pass it to you like it's a dutchie
Nobody can touch me, international or local
You're a yokel, I'd win a battle with my back up vocals
Snap you in a chokehold, slap you like I'm Stone Cold
Your spot is an impatient telemarketer, it won't hold!
Yo, the only shot you got is with a Smith &amp; Wesson
If I never rid your presence then consider this a blessing
With more bangers than the world's most dangerous intersection
I got my album sounding like a greatest hits collection
Yo I'm deadly!

[Chorus]

I disconnect you guys' disrespect
With wise intellect, devise crisp cassettes
So why's sisters wet if my music ain't fascinating?
Yo, you're going nowhere like you had the wackest travel agent
With no exaggeration, I'm somewhat an oracle
Historical facts are indicating your future's horrible
Solidified my spot while your rap career is portable
See I've been paying dues that you could never find affordable
You see because what Dan does is simply scandalous
Iller than what drivers of a Los Angeles ambulance is handed with
When gangstas is making advances for more social damages
Wonder like bread for sandwiches why you can't rap with bandages?
It's because I've brandished this: the awesomest sound
So phat, that any minute I'll be bawlin' from gout
This here's the illest verse to ever fall from a mouth
Umpires attracted to me won't dare calling me out
I'm warning you now, I have no problem beatin' you herbs
You deserve to be embarrassed just for speaking your slurs
You geeks and you nerds think dissing me cuts deep and hurts?
I hope you like the taste of shit, cuz you'll be eating your words!
Bwoy, I don't business, a deviant be shown no leniency
If he nuh see, I'm hip-hop's Braille, the world's feeling me!
Believe me please, when it comes to killers, here's my motto:
Consider the mighty Mono the Sopranos of Toronto!
I'm deadly!
