ALL MY MURDERERS!!!!!!
Let's march my niggas.

Lord, can we get a break?   (Lord, can we get a break?)
We ain't really happy here. (We ain't really happy here.)
Take a look into our eyes!  (Take a look into our eyes!)
And see pain without fear.  (And see pain without fear.)

Lord, can we get a break?   (Lord, can we get a break?)
We ain't really happy here. (We ain't really happy here.)
Take a look into our eyes!  (Take a look into our eyes!)
And see pain without fear.  (And see pain without fear.)

LORD, CAN WE GET A BREAK?   (LORD, CAN WE GET A BREAK?)
We ain't really happy here. (We ain't really happy here.)
Take a look into our eyes!  (Take a look into our eyes!)
And see pain without fear.  (And see pain without fear.)

LORD, CAN WE GET A BREAK?   (LORD, CAN WE GET A BREAK?)
We ain't really happy here. (We ain't really happy here.)
Take a look into our eyes!  (Take a look into our eyes!)
And see pain without fear.  (And see pain without fear.)

LORD! Oooooh Lord! Can we get a break?</pre>
