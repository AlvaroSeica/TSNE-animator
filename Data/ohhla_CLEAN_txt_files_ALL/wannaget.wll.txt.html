[Chamillionaire]
I'm a hustler, ladies man, of course a playa,
So say ya, prayers when I park the gator
Ya neighbors, suspect some suspicious behavior
Ready to call ya captain save her, to come save ya
But You're not in danger, Cuz I'm not a stranger
I just came fa, one night to entertain ya
Came to, ya crib I know it'll be a shame to
Waste this evening tryin to be a complainer
Fa Real

[Chorus: Heather Nicole]
If You Would've known 20 inches of chrome 
Was really turning me on 
Then we wouldn't be friends
Its just me alone and I'm getting it on
And I will never be wrong
My man won't know I'm  Cheating
Never let you know how I feel on the phone
Don't want this to go over the deep end
So I'm afraid I gotta let you know...
That I want to Get Sexual

[Chamillionaire]
I can pull up outside
Your crib in my ride
And tell my girl that I'll be at the studio lie
No one will know that I've even arrived, 
I'll show up at 4 and be out the door before 5 
Let me get up inside { You Got A Nasty Mind  }
I wasn't talking about ya  draws I was talking bout ya house
Because thats the first step once I get in the door
you already know, how the rest of the script go
me and you on the floor, you man is gon so I think we
can get kinky, drink d, lick the lengthy
sips of henny and soda got you so uh
far from sober, I'm like maan hold up
ya fine but I kind a, 
feel ya tryna turn me on showing designer panty liners
if I ever get the time or day then I'm a 
make you come like the space after a comma fa real

[Chorus: Chamillionaire]
If I Would've known 20 inches of chrome 
Was really turning you on 
Then we wouldn't be friends
We would alone somewhere getting it on
I know it would be be wrong
And then you'd be cheating
Never let you know how I feel on the phone
We both got lovers at home but we should't tell them
Don't be afraid baby let me know...
If you want to Get Sexual

Bridge...

[Paul Wall]
Catch game I'm pitching to ya come up out of the dark
Step up to the plate swing and hit you out of the park
Can you meet me out of the park
Let me seduce you
I'm kinda like Chris Tucker tryin to get me some mushu
let me introduce you... to pablo's peter
take ya shirt off then aye yi yi its unbelievable
Why you always tryin to act like I ain't bout nuttin
Girl you bluffin
You a Turkey let me stick you my stuffing
Wake you up out of ya dreams... it ain't what it seems
Let me get inside ya coffee and squirt my cream
You understand
Hear me out peep my slang
Quit acting like you aren't attracted by the way that I swang
I know the 20 inch thangs.. keep catching ya eye
don't let me catch you in a lie 
let me caress ya thigh
Let me play the itsy bitsy spider up under ya skirt
You wanna flirt but you don't wanna be hurt 
you think I'm a jerk

[Chorus: Heather Nicole]
If You Would've known 20 inches of chrome 
Was really turning me on 
Then we wouldn't be friends
Just leave me alone and we won't getting it on
And I will never be wrong
And wouldn't be Cheating
Never let you know how I feel on the phone
Don't want this to go over the deep end
So I'm afraid I can let you know...
