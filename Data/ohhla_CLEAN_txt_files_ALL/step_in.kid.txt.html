I think you might like to hear something from us

Stand up, put your hands up, come on, get up
Kid Rock's in the house, yo, ready to pick up
The tempo and you know in so I will flow
Somewhat unconventional but comprehendable
I'm the presentable, the good lookin'
The mellow yellow young fellow and I'm cookin'
Heatin' the house up just like a hot plate
Smooth on the groove like an ice skate
You didn't think in a blink I'd stand here
But now you're in fear and stand clear
You can't come near this hot stylin'
Groove by the kid who's smooth as a violin
Also the perfect lyric announcer
On the set with a cold forty ouncer
Ready to glide from side to side

Why, cause I step in stride
These are the criteria I believe should be applied
Cause I step in stride
These are the criteria I believe should be applied

N-N-Now yes I'm new but before I'm through
You're gonna see I paddle my own canoe
Cause I'm solo, a young pro on the go
Close to an angel but I wear no halo
I just shake, create and never act fake
And I learned to dislike and not hate
Because hatred leads to an uproar
Violence is one thing I am not here for
I'm just here flat out and to blow the roof
Kick some watts and that's what I intend to do
Pump it up like an air compressor
Teach to each like a wise professor
No job, I strive to reach high
Make the girls in the house all sigh
And I'll glide from side to side

Why, cause I step in stride
These are the criteria I believe should be applied
Cause I step in stride
These are the criteria I believe should be applied

Applied, step in stride, you bet I do
Get you high like a bottle of German Brew
Comin' clean, new on the scene
Makin' girls scream if you know what I mean
Cause they dream of me to rock the place
And put a big smile upon their face
Any girl of any race
But they have to like the b-b-bass
And that's the rep I've earned and kept
On the set, workin' up a sweat
No Jive, Kid Rock, I've arrived

Why, cause I step in stride
These are the criteria I believe should be applied
Cause I step in stride
These are the criteria I believe should be applied</pre>
