[Immortal Technique]

[Friend]
Yo son, fuck it then. Let's do something man, let's see some mamis out there

[Immortal Technique]
You know what? Matter fact pack the bags

[Friend]
Aight then

[Immortal Technique]
Start the fucking whip up, I'm outta here yo for real
Yo, I hate my job so I always look to a better day
Far from New York City on a tropical getaway
But not in Miami cause these white Cuban Anti-Castros can't stand me
And that's the reason I'll never win a fixed up Latin Grammy
After this racist Latinos'll goddamn me
But my Black people love me
And when I go to South America people'll be tryna hug me
Cause I talk about reality that effects them
And even though I blew up I could never neglect them
What kind of a revolutionary action would that be
I be categorizing practically every other MC
But never that cause I'm clever with facts
Sever your raps
Fake players and thugs
Will forever be whack
I'm still rolling with my squadron
Heavily strapped
And even if I get killed I'll enviably be back
Encyclopedia Hispanic are over digital dat
Don't ever compare me with small minded criminal cats
I kill kids on tracks like Dale Onhart
Spit in your face and leave your cheekbone with a burn mark
I was born a genius but I learned to be street smart
My vacation just started
I'm out to the Caribbean swimming in Dominican women the color of cinnamon

You motherfuckers wish you had the lifestyle I'm living in
(Laughs) Yo, yo

[Repeat 2x's]
East coast to West coast and everything in between
This is dedicated to everybody chasing they dreams
This ghetto fabulous life really ain't what it seems
But I'ma make it cause I got survival stuck in my genes

[Immortal Technique talking]
Word up (word), Immoral Technique representing Harlem all the way to my fam
in Englewood. I'm out motherfucker (Laughs The ghetto way nigga)</pre>
