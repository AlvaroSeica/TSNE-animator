You think this tattoo on my hand, is for decoration or something 
Way before I was a loc, the desert eagle was already dumping 
Rolling around in my dropper, looking out for the coppers 
Cause I'm coming to pop ya, me and this trigger 
You don't wanna fuck with the King of the Ghetto nigga 
Hey Mr. preacher man, yeah I know the bible 
I'm not in love with murder, I'm in love with my own survival 
Pardon me if I'm wrong, but I really don't give a damn 
As long as after the bullets stop flying, I walk away with my gun in my hand 
Nigga don't run up on me, you could die for less than that 
I'm about to pitch this fast ball, and your head neck and chest is at bat 
You ain't gotta like me, but I bet you gon' respect me 
And I bet I wear a dress, before I let somebody check me 
I been running around in this ghetto a long time, I'm doing just fine 
They don't hang they drag, I'm talking about these nuts of mine 
You ain't gotta believe me homie, just run up and try me 
You'll be dead, or hooked up to an IV

Top shotta make you move your body, or you can lose your body 
Move your body, me don't want no scariness around me 
Move your body, or you can lose your body 
Top shot doc'll make enough weapon, to bruise your body 
Move your body, or you can lose your body 
Move your body, me don't want no scariness around me 
Move your body, or you can lose your body 
Top shot doc'll make enough weapon, to bruise your body

(rude boy), what's happening my nigga shit what's cracking 
(please don't act a fool boy), shit you know I'm trying to chill mayn 
Nigga looking at me funny though 
(cause we don't need no yellow tape, around the dance hall tonight) 
Shit I'm trying to get fucked up anyway, (that's right) alright 
I really be trying to chill, but haters be looking at me all upside my head 
As if they plan to color me dead 
And stick me for my bread, before that happen I'll end up in the FED 
Doing a triple life sentence, for what I did with an infrared 
I get a rush when I bust heads open wide, I could damn near die 
I get a feeling all over my body, just like a PCP high 
My weapon is with me at all times, never leave home without it 
Or my attitude, ain't nothing friendly about it 
You might get the best of me, but I doubt it just ain't gon' happen 
I'm for real about this gangsta shit, but you just think I'm rapping 
Community never losing is what I'm down with, progression 
I know how to put my pistol down, and count my blessings 
The graveyard, is full of homies that died 
I probably put your homie there, if your homie was fucking with mine 
Even though a true warrior prays for peace 
I'ma empty the whole clip, until the day I'm deceased

One in the oil, and sixteen in the clip 
Top shotta keep it good, good cream in the zip 
When me fly my desert eagle, you'll do a full flip 
Me will fear no man, me don't want no scary buisness 
Might be lying, no one will see me when me wild like this 
Just don't push me button, everything remain crisp 
Had to do somebody new, it was a real thing mess 
All of y'all picking them, cheers after me love stick 
And I boom boom good, but not gon' fall in love with 
Rule one lift the punani, and focus on rich 
And if that boy test me, and me dig a bigger ditch 
Those fools will keep me busy, miss and chop another clip 
And fifty shot the clip, and then me shot a punk bitch 
My eyes are everywhere, rude boy me run this 
Skip town, or you when me out the mighty come kiss 
I am one you shouldn't really fuck with
