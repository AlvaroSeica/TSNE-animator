[Intro]
oohooh ooooh ooh oohooh oohooh
do it how we do it, (how we do it how we flow)
eski boi!
confident with the flow!

[Wiley]
I'm coming from a place where nobody obeys the law
street law ain't the same as real police laws
I wanna know what you're stopping me for, really
It ain't 'cos i've run out of tax, search the car
You won't find what you're looking for
I ain't got drugs and I ain't got a gat in my car
there's a baseball bat in my car
but I use that to play baseball or I play rounders
who made guns, you are the founders
the level of gun crime is going bonkers
the ammount of drugs on the street is beyond us
them politicians blame us
them politicians, they don't like us
they wanna see us self destruct, but
some of us are too smart to be taken apart
and the strength, light blinks
theres a fire in my heart listen up, 'cos.

[Chorus: x2]
5-0's acting like people don't know
the governments acting like people don't know
to me it seems like they don't know
where we're coming from

see I knew a girl back in the day
never had a penny to her name
almost worked two jobs, just to raise her kids
yeah

see the house that she was living at
see it wasn't that appropriate
to cut a long story short
they took her kids away
oh what a shame

[Chorus x2]

[BR Double]
I'm a coming up
menace to society
me, br-double from the lost society
no morals, let alone priorities
mad brother, he pays the largest majority
It's my porogative, gotta think positive
cos everything around me's negative
know what I roll with, and who I roll with
you can never live where I live

I'm lost, I'm wearing a matrix top
politics, I'm play tricks
let's take it all back to basics
no mortgage, just a few bricks and mortar
I still keep my head above the water
drowned if I was a half foot shorter
so let me tell you where I'm coming from
where the boogie man's the only man I'm running from

[Chorus x2]</pre>
