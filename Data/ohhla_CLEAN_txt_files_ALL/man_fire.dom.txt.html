(Sample)
Pay attention!
Today we will be training with no live ammunition.
Sir! What should we bring out to Europe? Sir!
You're not ready private.
Sir! With all due respect, me and my brother are ready.
Ready to kill.
I will not repeat myself private.
You will continue training until further notice.
We are ready, sir!
We want to kill, we want to go now.
Training now will commence.
Dismissed.

(Intro)
Yeah, yeah, we going in, we going in
What, straight fire

[Dom Pachino]
Yo, I'm hot, approaching the crisp
Third degree burns for holding my disc
So hot the jakes don't wanna frisk
They say I'm not worth the risk
Fuck around and get burnt in this shift
I'm hot like the tip of a spliff
Hotter than uncut cocaine sniff
Your brain shift, fucking with me
Beats is dangerous, I'll rearrange the game, kid
And straight change it
And bring it right back to the essence and drop bangings

(Hook)
I'm hot,                (How hot is it?)
I'm on fire; I'm live	(How live is it?)
I'm livewire; I'm hot	(How hot is it?)
I'm on fire; I'm live	(How live is it?)
I'm livewire; I'm hot	(How hot is it?)
I'm on fire; I'm live	(How live is it?)
I'm livewire

Can't fuck with me, man
Get burnt to a crisp

[Dom Pachino]
I'm too hot, they can't endure my heat
Step in the room, I'm straight fire
They fall to their feet, I baptize these rap guys
They see the Holy Ghost
They talk shit and fraternize and see my holy toast
I'm Bonkers, from the side of Yonkers
From Broad-street to Tompkins
And when I touch the West-Coast you know I'm Straight Outta Compton
But you know I love NY
And I been kicking fly rhymes before they touched our skylines
You feel me? The real me
So sick they can't heal me
Too hot in '99, the RZA wanna conceal me
I was labeled the weapon, a mass destruction
Wu was under investigation, cases filled with corruption
The Army was on Channel One news for spitting that substance
Exercising the Constitution is not a solution
And start to recruiting, soldiers start to saluting
Soldiers stand up, yeah, its retribution

(Hook)

Can't fuck with me, man
Get burnt to a crisp</pre>
