[Young Deuces]
I got mad flavor, man you need to know dat
Im fresh up out the plastic, fresh up out the pack
Rock a clean white tee, my jeans sittin on my Nikes
And a new blue brewer, man that shit be looking right
I walk up in da spot, you can meet me in da vip
Shawty eyein me, she dyin to come out &amp; give me lip
I just, I just do my thing, cant nobody do it better
Rock a big, gold chain on my cardigan sweater
My Flavor go Hard, A lot of niggaz copy
They do it like me but they make it look sloppy
You Rock them skinny jeans, but that is just a no-no
You think you lookin hard but you be lookin homo
You can say im twitter, just ask around about him
Cause I be setting trends that everybody follow
I rep the Midwest, our style is so Wavy
But if you hatin, all I got to say is...

[Chorus]

[Streetz]
I be goin ham, I be, I be goin Ape shit
The truth is an ugly mutha fucka do face it
The boy spit mean, so clean like Ajax
shawty like my sac, she gaurantee to climax
Garauntee to come back, like work in the water
I fuck her so good she wanna meet me at the alter
Look nigga you ought ta, find you a hobby
I got a way with words, this is lyrical robbery [WHOA!]
I'm respected highly, el Capiatain
When I started making money, I stopped making friends
You got Clay Aiken money, your shit, not straight
Money Acrobatic, mines flip like hot cakes
See me in that hot 8, bitch im on my grind
Transformers Lambo, Optimus Prime, Whoa!
Racks I get plenty, Racks, Racks, I get plenty
I got so many call it JC Penny [WHOA!]

[Chorus]


[Young Deuces]
I Got Mad Flavor, Word to Ben &amp; Jerry
Hotter than June, Colder den February
I cannot see with these Louie V's on
Rapper please get gone, all your songs make me yawn
I was chillin in the VIPper saw your girl eyein
Watch me, Watch Me go &amp; get her, Now you their crying
Cause she tuggin on my zipper, homie I aint lyin
We gone, We gone, We gone flip her, yeah we gonna flip her

[Streetz]
You tryin to get her, I be like forget her
She all on my Twitter, asking do I miss her
I be like No, I be, I be like no
Got a green Light on yo favorite lady, that mean Go
Hold Up, Hold Up, Hater Whoa, you ain, you aint got these
Dookie rope around my neck so cold I sneeze
In these dungarees, I gets, I gets lots of cheese
But ima see you later, Why?, Cause I Got Mad Flavor
