Song:   Catch Tha Beat
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Uh chip the... ripper
You hear the crickets and the beat
Rockwoller crazy

Ok good evenin everyone and welcome to the track
That u prolly downloaded from your pc or your mac
Yes I'm the main topic and the barbershop chat
Now you can call me chip or you can call me crack
I'm and n the comfy condo with every one of your ladies
Now say hi gurls... shh ok how bout some silence
Let's see if I can focus while these gurlies tickle my privates YES
Baby I'm the ripper
Baby I'm a winner
Thick gurls are freaks but she say shes a beginner
I put you on a diet if you tryna get thinner
Babies for breakfast babies for dinner
I grip the damn grain til my hand get splinters
I control the ball before the snap jus like the centers
But this ain't football cause if it waz then ya bitch would be the wide reciever
Crawlin on the rug and
I would be the quaterback telling her to go long and
She will catch the touchdown pass above her thong
Sumthing must be wrong wat is going on
Everybodies t-shirts is still to damn long
And that waz cool a couple years ago but now it's different
I don't pay for the jeans I jus pay true religion
And ofcourse the man on my shirts riding a horse
And I wear so much DC they should indorse
Live life denim
I live life in'em
Wear so much live mechanics people asked did I invent'em
People tend to forget where I'm from here and there
Cause I'm on Sax Fifth Avenue more than I'm on the clair
And if you owe me a dolla you on death row
Dat .45 hurt the swellen like strept throat
Fuck a lady get the money sip the liquor
Cause bitches ain't shit mother nature waz a stripper

Now watch me catch the beat haha
Catch the beat haha
Catch the beat haha
Catch the beat haha
Now watch me catch the beat haha
Catch the beat haha
Catch the beat haha
Catch the beat haha
Now watch me catch the beat haha
Catch the beat haha
Catch the beat haha
Catch the beat haha
Now watch me catch the beat haha
Catch the beat haha
Catch the beat haha
Catch the beat haha</pre>
