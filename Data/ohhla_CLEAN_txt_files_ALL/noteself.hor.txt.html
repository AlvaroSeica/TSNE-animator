[Solo]
I wrote this one with the windows open
to let in some fresh air or maybe I was half-hoping
I could fly away from it all, find a brighter day
But I'm here to live my life and I'll find a way
I got to thinking, you know that it ain't so bad
I got my friends and my brother and my mum and my dad
and IÕm thankful for that, sorry I donÕt show it enough
These are the people that I turn to when the going gets tough
What up? I give thanks to my mates and crew
like the boys say "Together we gon' make it through"
And the same goes for you too wherever you hail from
The words may change but weÕre singing the same song
It's in the key of life
Though we might forget the tune from time to time, man weÕll be alright
Look at the metres gained, stand in today's sun
You can't yet deal with tomorrow's rain

[Chorus: 2X]
See thatÕs life kid, we just tryna live it right kid
Cause it'll pass in the blink of an eyelid
So get your smile on, throw your hands high
Stay happy with the now till tomorrow arrives

[Solo]
If these walls could talk, I'm not sure I'd wanna listen
ItÕs a fine line between a game and a competition
But sometimes I sit back and look at how far weÕve come
and it's hard to believe it only just begun
Sometimes I wonder if you really understand
the drive that I find inside your encouragement
Sometimes I think about the days way back
'fore the hurt crept in, tainted that household name
Love in that very household's name
and now that household's painful memories for some
Endless card games and road trips, charades
Remember the good times, I'm sure there's plenty more to come
See I'm here now, ear to ear now
CouldnÕt see for the storm but horizonÕs clear now
And I just want to leave you with these words
No matter where each of us ends up on this earth for what it's worth

{Repeat 12X}
I just want you all to know that I will love you all forever

[Solo]
Cause whatÕs life but a journey of bus fares and train rides
Long days, late nights, kick snares and bass lines
Hearts broken and tears shed, good times spent with dear friends
From sunrise down to sunset, there's still breath in my chest
So I'ma keep walking the line and no I ain't done yet
See I know it can be hard at times
But you only get one shot, donÕt let it pass you by
So what if you havenÕt yet met the love of your life?
So what if youÕve had your fair share of trouble and strife?
What I'm saying when I'm rhyming this verse
is I realise we have so little time on this earth
So from my people down the front to the kid up the back
Let me see you crack a smile if you feeling the track
Let go of your sorrow and be glad you're alive
Let's all be happy with the now till tomorrow arrives

[Chorus: 2X]
