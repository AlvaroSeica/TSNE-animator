My mind got erased I think somebody better help me
Trying to get my memory back and I feel like Leonard Shelby
They took my LP that just got mastered for release 
So I gotta get that cd back before the tracks are leaked
I got a cop assigned to my case but I can't believe his lies
He's Teddy and I'm Eddie But his name is just a disguise
Trying to getting me to find the wrong guy who committed the crime
And I can only think the rhymes that were once committed to mind
And then there's Natalie A female battle Mc
She knows what I'm going through she got her cd stolen too
She'll help me out of pity in this city that has no name 
And I don't even got a recollection of the place where I'm staying
Need a Polaroid camera to piece together the clues 
And the most important facts are on my body as tattoos
I'mma find Kool Kieth ask him about Matthew
His master was stolen too and everybody was left baffled 
Ask him what to do first I've been having a lack of luck
He said first fact whoever jacked it was wack as fuck
But back up first you gotta understand why I act this way
I got short term memory loss they call it Antero grade
The last thing I remember was my body as it layed
With a shotty on my face all alone and afraid
And the Doctors say that I can learn through conditioning
Trust my intuition to help reveal the cd that is missing
So I listen but heavily rely on my hand writing
Was it a friend or foe that stole either way you know I don't like him
When I find him will I fight him slice him or Mike Tys him
Bash his ears so he can never hear stuck in daydreams like Everclear
The truth is never near so I'mma dig deeper for clues
Fact 2 found out his name was John G got the tattoo

And supposively I can learn through repetition
Try to piece together the fact but a couple steps are missing
For instance this was a crime obviously organized by haters
But haters are everywhere in a variety of flavors
Maybe neighbors or some fake kids that I used to politic with
But this shit got their mouths closed and their lips zipped so
I'm in need of some help I can't find the culprit alone
So I call up Natalie but I'm not too good on the phone
We met at her home and I gave her the thief's license plate number
She has friends at the DMV we'll meet later on to eat for the ID
I got plans to get the man who ruined my life and did this 
And after tonight I can get my album finished
I met her up at the diner to retrieve the information
One manila envelope can solve the problems that I'm facing
She was reluctant to give it up thought it was too much to handle
But I spent too many nights burning both ends of the candle
Convinced her to let me get my vengeance on this animal
Pulled out the papers and found out it was John Edward Gammel
My heads bout to burst shit its ready to pop
I figured all along that it was Teddy the cop
And Eddie won't strop whether I remember or not
Called him up and lured him to a secluded spot
Faked like I had a lead but in reality I came to end today
Forget about assault and battery
I put the gun to his face he said I was making a mistake
But facts are facts it's the memory that can be faked
I asked repeatedly for the master but he wouldn't give up the cd
So I shot him through the cheek dead courtesy of ED</pre>
