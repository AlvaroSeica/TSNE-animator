[Intro] [Blueprint talking]
Alright, let's talk about pain on this one
It ain't that bad you know. You gotta go through that shit
If you ever felt that shit. Any kind of pain
That's where I'm goin' with this. Hurts so bad
 
[Chorus] [x4]
"Hurts so bad...so"
 
[Verse One] [Blueprint]
I don't let the drums
Dictate what I spit lay
Or if the rhythm of it what makes it great
I listen to it and then when I hit play
My mind drift into a place 50 years away
I see what would have been if I let the pen lay
The old me got so many things to say
But nobody listen cause his beard is gray
So he tells me to get back here and seize the day
See, I don't need peace and quiet
I really don't like it, it really ain't the way
Cool concept but hardly inspirin' when peace is the only thing you see everyday
Now I don't think we need riots
Or all types of violence for things to be okay 
But in terms of environment we need somethin' to fight against
Cause most great art can't exist without pain
Cut off your own ear if it gets you to paint
Tell us that you do it for the people that hate
Can't enjoy sun unless you sit through the rain
Again, most great art can't exist without pain

See, you ain't got nothin' to save
Cause everything about you is safe
You live in the prettiest place
Rivers and lakes, makin' serious cake
You talkin' but I ain't hearin' them thangs
Sleepwalkin', you ain't really even awake
Too often, this is how you spend all your days
If this really the case then it's really a waste
And maybe that's why I can't fuck with you
You too comfortable
You too Huxtable
Police don't even fuck with you
You ain't see them leavin' people bleedin' right in front of you
All I see is white tees and popped collars
  Pit bullsand rottweilers
People who ain't got options
Might as well keep the block poppin'
 
[Chorus] [x4]
"Hurts so bad...so"
 
[Verse Two] [Illogic]
Yes
He laughs when he cries because his eyes are bleedin' passion
Every stroke of his appendage is redemption for the masses
Every listen is a prescription he's given by the master of creation
Every puddle is reflectin' disaster 
Hatches a creation after the thunder and lightening 
The horizon has to birth the sun risin'
Believe it, no flame, no phoenix, I've seen it
No struggle, no progression
Caught me shootin' for the stars with the lessons my scars taught me
Brethren, I've been in the dark without a spark of light
The darkness was only eliminated when I was illuminated to right
The wrongs, I write the songs that'll penetrate at the hearts of many
My art is simply therapy
Every rose's thorns protects the purity it's usual
Without the thorns the rose just wouldn't be as beautiful
Without them, my catalog just wouldn't be the same
Cause most great art can't exist without pain
 
[Chorus] [x8]
"Hurts so bad...so"</pre>
