Satisfaction is power over everything and I'm powerless
Gluttony hasn't gone out of style since the fall of man
We scratch and claw, we steal and kill, ambitions caused
When one can forget the magnitude of his foot high
And I'm thinkin' again
Trying to unravel the mystery of existing
So perplexing, I'm not missing anything, I don't think
Constantly listening and looking and feeling
And I'm still just as lost as a human can be
And I'm thinkin' again, lost as a human can be
And I'm thinkin' again, all I can do is let it happen to me

And I'm thinkin' again, and I'm drinkin' again
And I'm thinkin' again, and I'm drinkin' again
And I'm thinkin' again, and I'm drinkin' again
And I'm thinkin' again, and I'm drinkin' again

Looking for things to do to pass the time between birth
And becoming part of the earth
Working, playing and laying, staring, comparing
That over there to this
I'm blaming those in charge cause after all there's nothing else to do
Money pays for things that don't really belong to you

And I'm thinkin' again, And I'm thinkin' again, and I'm drinkin' again
And I'm thinkin' again, and I'm drinkin' again
A velvet tablecloth, a pack of Viceroys, a bottle of gin
And I'm drinkin' again, and I'm thinkin' again
And I'm thinkin' again, and I'm drinkin' again

A deck of cards playing solitaire
Birds everywhere, in the park, on a bench
I smell of an awful stench
I am a loser and I'm all alone
I sit in the bathroom and thump my bone
And I'm thinkin' again, and I'm drinkin' again
And I'm thinkin' again, thinkin' again</pre>
