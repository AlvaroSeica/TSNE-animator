That's a nice guy
Now that's a beautiful doll, look at that

[Bronze Nazareth]
Yo, back in '88, I was nine or maybe eight
Staring at a china plate, dad said I bought it if it breaks
Wait, we not a wanting grapes, church drapes stare back at me
In Gun Rule, more than one tool in pop's cabinet
He had a rifle, 357 and twenty two
Tender age of 'i don't know', he taught me how to shoot
Mosquito's bite, my trigger finger told me to spark it
I'm thinking all the time, how humans used to be his target
From hot jungle, a little different from my forest
So mind your business, all relatives can hit the florist
Now I love fatigues ever since I remember
Played war with fake guns, even in cold December
Shot time, borrow in the back of the house, he fell out
Dusted off this gun like I was cleaning the house
Every game we played I was the last one slayed
I got in the dirt with a clean shirt, tossing my grenades
War was so easy, gats easily be my best friend
We had mad lives, and never really would end
Moms scared cuz I used to come home with purple hearts
Loved to break shit, never used a board when throwing darts
Booby trap garage, so neighbors can step on glass
My pops all got the windows smiling like nerve gas
I'm eleven years old and my wargame is too smart
Like I'mma hit the streets with a passion that sparks
Burnt the fort down with cousins like Vietkong was in it
Used to stare at dad's picture with M-16 guns in it
Wished it was me, with a itchy trigger finger
So ya'll better buy my album, or my syndrome might still linger
Cuz if I didn't have music, I'd still these hammers
Shove it in your gums, empty clips like the cannisters
A robbing armored truck, burnt his clip, merge
Cuz it's forty hours a week, bullshit is for the birds</pre>
