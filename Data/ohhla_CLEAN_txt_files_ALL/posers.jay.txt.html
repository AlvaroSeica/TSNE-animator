Question
How does one go from chosen to posin
Trapped in a box for years, like han solo frozen
Trapped in a wack idea designed by De Beers
To keep your mental eyelids closed and your eyeballs bulgin
Fear, it can kill a man
Turn a real man to a realer man
Or package you
As a bathin ape wearin gorilla stan
This message is brought to you in part from a michael jackson thriller fan
I had the glove plus the matchin jack the zippers haaaaa
It's cool to imitate, the drone to your own
Don't let the green grass across the picket fence
Turn you into mister smith without a purpose or a home
Underneath he is a jedi on the surface he's a clone
Smilin for his peers but,
At nighttime he cried til he dried up all his tear ducts
And he cool with that as long as he got a haircut and his gear up
Without change we over
From individuals to posers...</pre>
