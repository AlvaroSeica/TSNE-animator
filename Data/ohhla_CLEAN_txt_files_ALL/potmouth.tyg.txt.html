[Tyga]
Ahh! Uhh; one shot, bumba claat
Bitches jumpin on my dick, hoppin like it's hop-scotch
Booty pop, my bitch don't wear that she probably ass shots
I don't give a fuck, I fuck 'em all till they pussy ouch
Potty mouth, "Oochie Wally" bang bang then I'm out
Once a-fuckin-'pon a time, had your bitch inside my house
Cookin grits and ridin dick, swear she the best chef around
"Pop That Pussy" now let me see you "Doo Doo Brown"
"I Wanna Rock" I wanna rock
Tell these bitch niggaz it's they time of the month
Time of the month niggaz want beef but I eat that shit
Eat eat everything well done {WELL DONE}
I'm so far in the clouds I can barely hear
All that shit you rockin boy, that was last year
GOAT's here, niggaz steer my style like a stop deer
Pump fear, to you bitches heart, Suge without the beard
Ha ha~! Man all these new niggaz weird
They all linin up to come and see the Last King

[Chorus: Tyga]
Ohh, I get money, uhh, I make money
I take money, them bitches want it from me
Cause I'm, I'm 'bout whatever, ah, I'm 'bout whatever
I, I'm with whatever, man I do it, do it better
Two two more shots, then I'm out
I'm a muh'fucker and I got a potty mouth
Ah, I'm 'bout whatever, man, I'm 'bout whatever
Man, I'm with whatever man I do it, do it better

[Tyga]
Man, I fucked your dime and now she's mine
2 Live Crew, put the pussy in my palm
She put on a nigga and make a grown man cry
Feelin bullshit, I don't pay you no mind
But what's yo' sign? Gemini?
Scorpio, let me fuck from behind
However you want it, baby
Light the blunts, blunts and close yo' eyes
Real nigga doe, real nigga doe
Got a freak bitch in the D, +B.I.+ put me on dough
Came in the do', "Kick in the Do'"
wavin the fo'-fo', put one one in your blowhole
Whewww~! Oh man yo' paper thin, you need to take some notes
Niggaz steal my lines and say they don't
There go another new quote
I'm fresh off the boat, nigga let's toast
Young Money real, y'all shit just a hoax
Made a fairytale, busy on a float
Why would I lie? Forever under oath, I'm...
so fuckin frustrated wit'cho lady
Get a flight, I send her home, man my love is oh so tainted
If you fine, you might get diamonds
If you a five, you might get nothin
I'm on my monsters, straight from a mosh pit
R-r-r-rock you like Nirvana, uhh
Man I be off Patron like it's a holiday
Fuckin with them finer things, pull up on yo' bitch and say

[Chorus]

[Tyga - voice slowed and chopped]
Man I fucked your dime, still in my prime
Young D, I'm freshest nigga on the line
Better man up, it's about to go dow-down
Leave you with jaw dropped, face on the gr-ground
Let the rain fill the moats 'round my kingdom
Carved in the cement, star, pledge allegiance
I'ma legend leave 'em screamin-screamin-screamin
Dr-dreamin just to get by-by
Girl you so fly (fly) why you so high? (High?)
Two two more shots, then I'm out
I'm a muh-muh'fuckin pot-potty mouth
I'm, I'm 'bout whatever, ah, I'm 'bout whatever
I, I'm 'bout whatever, man I do it, do it better
All-all bad bitches in my house-house
I'm a muh'fucker, fuck her then I kick her out-out
'bout whatever, ah, I'm 'bout whatever
I, I'm 'bout whatever, man I do it, do it better

[Busta Rhymes]
Cannibal, I eat you raw meat, I'm raw with beats
So scavenger with it, nigga look like Jaws with feet
You don't want it, bitch
Y'all niggaz know I get gully, what you want?
Listen close, y'all don't hear how the beat get ugly
when a motherfucker come through? Excuse me bitch
Please let me kill it just a little bit and let a nigga do what he do
Movie shit, that Tec make a niggaz wanna vomit spit
You niggaz already knew
She keep on frontin niggaz, then I'm lightin up another city
Got her fightin 'til they get to bitin they we gettin gritty
See the time and now a nigga climbin up another milli
Then we shinin 'til a nigga blind them, up until it kills me
Forth and back and my dyin is a nigga 'til it pulls up on the track
Then I'ma die 60 niggaz 'til we pop off like we in the Wild West
When I finished givin you the crack pipe
If you ain't know I'm en route to the crib
just to park the Bugatti at the house
Sing big and one of my bitches really turn her out
Now still everyone know I got a potty mouth
Now shiiiit, they got me doin it again
Back to bodyin things and lots of screwin other women
You can never stop the shit that I be doin and the way that we movin
Get it poppin, never stoppin, kill 'em in the end now
Then I'ma get 'em to the point
when I got 'em all open, handlin my business with 'em (HA)
Trust me, you don't wanna start cause you know it's TORTURE
Every single minute 'til I finish with 'em; and I knock shit down
Every time I come and then I lock shit down
'til I come up place niggaz better drop that crown
Give it here, 'fore I pop you clowns, and I do erase niggaz!</pre>
