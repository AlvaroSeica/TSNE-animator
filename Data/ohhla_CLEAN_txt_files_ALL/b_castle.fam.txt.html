[Timbo King]
Step inside the Black Castle
Where there's no stress, no mental hassles
Understand the culture of life, don't let it pass you
King's County, the Royal place, where the palace is
Urban territory, where the nobles and the soldiers live
Draw bridge drop, we got our own empire
Know and fort, like Hamilton, I be the high Isiah
Black Knights march, we starch, if you wrinkle
Equality therefore, Royal men, are equal
We build, deal with science, showing and proving
Teaching the dumb, deaf and blind, is what we're doing
A foundation, it takes a nation, to start something
Revolutionize, rise up, dead the fronting
Black Castle, located in the slum section
Follow the righteous path, know all the right directions
Ghetto streets alias, no wild kingdom
For those who knows, those who don't, bring 'em

[Chorus 2X: Mikey Jarrett]
Black Castle, Royal Fam stand by Allah
Black Castle, Kingston, busting now with art
Black Castle, Royal men must claim the law
Black Castle, organize the nation for the cause

[Mikey Jarrett]
We come through with brute, tell the guys, the mighty men
To fight and defeat, all you wicked boys them
To overcame and conquer is my intention
To spread nuff love, yes, to all me bredren
Whether out of town, or in a Brooklyn
Love, peace, courage, strength and defense
With eternal imprisonement, for I nah want repent
Soldiers from the almighty Clan
Rugged rude boy, militant, with some are content
The almighty sense, salvation, rising, me bled
All the right men, yes we come again, feel me!

[Chorus 2X]

[Timbo King]
In this vicinity, it's sorta like a dynasty
Concrete environment, the area's designed to be
Plus stacked royaly, call it a landmark
Hooded soldiers roll like the one million man march
Imperial facility, home of the true kings
Build and destroy, everyday, that's how we do things
Medina, rulers and warriors control it
Kings, the many of, red carpet, keeps rolling
The promissed land, man, woman and child share this
But never careless, all about, conscience awareness
Third eye seeing, supreme being, the true and living
Kings and queens, remember, in the beginning
We conquer, black supremecy is reigning
Maintaining, we got the enemy complaining
The rook piece, alias, the wild kingdom
For those who know, those who don't, bring 'em

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
