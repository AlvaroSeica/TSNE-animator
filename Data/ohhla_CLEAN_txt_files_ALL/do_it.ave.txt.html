[Verse One: Troy Ave]
Now I ain't got a worry in the world I went from dealin bricks
To doin rap, and now a nigga know I'm 'gon be rich
I see the haters I'm pointin, and laughin at their tears
I'm the biggest thing out my city in the past ten years
They don't do shit they pussy, in gats we trust
We ain't the same and, mu'fuckers never loved us
Drake do R&amp;B that's how he makes his chip
I did R&amp;B too but mines was rap &amp; bricks
Don't knock the hustle we open come in go shop
And you can buy anything except your way to the top
I look and sound like New York, all my beats do knock
These other rappers lookin shitty like tryin to see Young Chop
I'm fever, the new school leader
You ain't got no class I don't fuck with you neither
So don't tell me that you rep New York do you like what I bring?
I heard that song when you was tryin to be like 2 Chainz
You ridin 'round lickin dick, I'm ridin 'round with the grip
Life ill and everything real and niggas spit
A few of you want payback 'cause your people gone
But I know God got me I did more right than wrong
Cobain is chillin, the business buildin
I want more and I say let's get millions
That's what we 'bout to be gettin I ain't tryin to boast
But you niggas can't see me mu'fucker I'm ghost!

[Verse Two: Styles P]
I'm +Ghost+ too! Guess what I'm close to? The handgun
The weedbag; tell grandmothers I kill they grandsons
My soul's ugly, my face handsome
I sold base and I took niggaz for ransom
Ex-stick up kid, hero-in dealer
Lot of rappers claimin they real, but I BET I'm realer
I'm just a O.G. smokin O.G. kush
I murdered that Young Goines, get the O.G. push
It's enormous shit, no informing shit
Getcha popped up, .38 tourin shit
Niggaz like me, is the reason that the laws exist
Lord assist, Captain Nemo wanted no other list
You wants bricks? I'm the one you put the order with
Fuck it up, you gettin drowned and your daughter pissed
I'm on some Mexican, cartel border shit
I got fishscale, who lookin to score the shit?
I got big bullets, who wanna wxplore the clip?
Either the big 9 or the four to fifth
Or you can get a shell from the trey pound
The money stacks up, but I stays down</pre>
