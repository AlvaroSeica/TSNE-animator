(I'll be watching you)

I'm MC Peaches with the rep of a superstar
And yes you are my man, but you can't drive my car
Hey, you don't pay my rent, and even if you did
You still couldn't play me out, no, not this kid
The sweet talk that you make on all the other women
Works just like a charm, but you know how I'm livin
I won't be caught in games, no matter what you do
I know who's zoomin who, boy (I'll be watching you)

(I'll be watching you)

Boy, every breath you take, man, every word you utter
Don't you make a mistake and talk about another
Yes, to forgive's devine, but I'm not heavenly
No, I'm not running blind, so don't you mess with me
Because a woman's scorn is no joke, don't laugh
Revenge is sweet, my dear, I'm takin more than half
Yes, I can see clearly now that the rain is gone
I'll let you get near me but remember the song

(I'll be watching you)

You had a heavy rep as a major player
But I can hang out too, now what you have to say, huh?
I'm MC Peaches, baby, I'll always make do
Yo, I can tame the shrew, boy (I'll be watching you)
