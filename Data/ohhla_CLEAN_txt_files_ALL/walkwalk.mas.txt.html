[Intro: Master Fuol (Unique London)]
Walk the walk (parktown) spit the spit (parktown)
(Get the fuck off, show these motherfuckers)

[Chorus 2X: All]
I walk the walk, spit the spit
If my fist don't swang, fish don't swim

[Interlude: Unique London]
What the fuck ya'll niggas want for? Go over there and kick some ass

[Thirstin Howl III] (Master Fuol)
Pulling gold cards, all heart when war start
Sword shark, more shots, moree shots, more shots
Hard liquor, bar tender, no more drinks for ya'll niggas
(Security said they want us out) not enough bouncers to hold us down
Grasss scuffle, grass knuckle, stash shuffle, glad to cut you
(Fuck the police and the FBI) now imagine the gun they scared to fight
(Squad car, paddy wagon) snitch bitch (already ratting)
Steady yapping, ready ratchets, Machete magic, deadly hatchets

[Interlude: Unique London]
Cut that pretty muthafucka with a rusty knife

[Chorus 2X]

[Interlude: Unique London]
You're some fucking dirty Brooklyn project rats

[Master Fuol &amp; Thirstin Howl] III {Thirstin Howl III}]
Brownsville Van Dyke, walk is walk, we scats fight
Crab's dice, steady courting, prject buildings letting off
Fuck you miss me cheap wine whiskey
{We the reasons elevators stay pissy}
Housing cops, a thousand shots
Doubt it not, we bout them glocks
I catch a body body I catch a body body
{I left a long nose on my pump shotti shotti}
Blood bath, wash cloth, fat lady, encores
Warm prok, show torch {Showing off, not a gun show}
Cold bath, breath easy, fingers squeezing, thirsty, greedy

[Interlude: Unique London]
You get your stan nigga, shut the fuck up if you ain't holding

[Chorus 2X]

[Interlude: Unique London]
Thirsty, greedy, bloody, grimey, what the fuck you rapping

[Master Fuol &amp; Thirstin Howl III (Thirstin Howl III)]
Spit Squad lowlife that coasts nice
But we don't ever pay the whole price
Poltergeist, po po nice (better hold your knif if you want those nights)
Street lords, governement, vote Guliani, we love no bitch
Walk the walk, spit the spit, (dick stick shift in the pigeon's rib)
A cluck cluck here and a cluck cluck there
We both spend the money coming from welfare
Dirty scraps, street fights, uppercut, clean right
Hey maker, homemade banger, reaching for the straight razor
Throat slit, hold this, clean you out so don't snitch

[Interlude: Unique London]
You thugged out, so why you telling police, pussy

[Chorus 2X]

[Interlude: Unique London]
You want to play dirty? cockroach, snakes, bats

[Hook 4X: Master Fuol &amp; Thirstin Howl III]
Hey maker, homemade banger, reaching for the straight razor

[Interlude: Unique London]
Skillionare, prepare for world domination, Master Fuol, Rack Lo
Big Boo, Pretty Ballad, Unique London, PF Cuttin, Thirstin Howl, Spit Squad
Low life, fuck the music industry, breaking all the rules
