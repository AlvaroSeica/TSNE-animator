[Intro: Christbearer]
Yeah (19x)

[Chorus 2X: Christbearer]
Drama, drama, that's what they call it
Drama, drama, bitches and niggas servin'
Drama, drama, that's what they call it
Drama, drama, don't even come to me with

[Christbearer]
Them bitches servin' drama, to the young Dhali Llama
Even stressing out my mama
I'mma trip, like my nigga Big Kip
When he had to put it down, servin' pounds of the chronic
Nigga, drama is a muthafucka
Bitches on my coat tail, while I'm bailing through the gutter
Comin' at me with a world of geez
Like, "It's your baby, and nigga, you gotta pay me"
I'm like, bitch, now I done heard it all before
While I was fuckin', you was givin' up the drawers galore
Don't even come at me with drama
I told them niggas in the Palmer, you fucks with Jeff Dahmer

[Concept]
Aiyo, cedar block, heart stops, raw glocks pierce the chest
Another soul rest, broken spirits are now a walking flesh
God bless, relieve my stress, so we bang like migraines
Eternal pain, black rain, niggas speak my name
Burn 'em in the flames, desperate times, cause, wicked minds
Every line I spit, ready for apocalypse, hard to hit
Guard your shit, watch your skin rib torment
My niggas hate the government, I'm just a criminal rhyming over instrumentals

[Interlude: Christbearer]
Yo fuck that shit, that bitch talking bout "That's my baby" (drama)
My moms said that bitch calling me like six times (drama)
This nigga talking bout he don't got my money, you got my money!

[Chorus]

[Melo]
I'm laying down the best in your clan, Melo's the man
Spitting out these razor sharp quotes, ending yo plan
Ain't nobody getting no shit, after I end it
These funny ass niggas talk shit, and I'mma end it
I'm killing the cypher with one word, you fucking nerds
Getting what, ever deserve, we mix and serve
I rock mics, just to get on, ending your song
With a "fuck you", fax on the blocks, and we gon' touch you
Rush you, back to the lab, I get it there
My lyrics straight weigh by the gram, nigga I'm dope
I got 'em all hanging by ropes, jocking my quotes
I got 'em all hanging by ropes, jocking my quotes

[Suave]
Yo, in this world in time, a young troop like me
Comes the P, why the fuck I see like I be
Making decisions on Earth, like seen and like a mirage
Glamour and glitter, coat it by a layer, sabotage
Much land I've seen, ride on this mission for the paper
No home for many miles, from this place is much greater
And I ain't too far, my own kicking ass self
With two g's, two cutties, and two, clips on the shelf
So I mash my craft, but yet, still maintain
So I'm hardest, I drive it drunk and freaky freaky with Mary Jane
Rescope my aim, get it back on cue
Kicking ass out these jay's, like a West Coast crew gon' do
Ain't shit new to this Suave don see, gritty and bring
Hit rocks or bomb green, crisp and clean
Like bills, now going up like kills in 'Frisco
Or good like Nabisco, those cookies be
Looking so nice so I grasp, meaning a bask
Continue swooping, that food caught jet lag
Now my pants sag, for constant stacking of the dollars
What to use your fusion tongue up, and putting a stomp down on drama

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
