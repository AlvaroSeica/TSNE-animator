Intro:

Yo it's on it again
I got muthafuckin 5 footer, I got Teflon, I got M.O.P.
I got Mr. Walt with the funky beat
Yeah, niggas can't make no muthafuckin noise
Yea yeah
Bring it on

[Teflon]
Now strap on your seatbelt, get ready for blast off
We on the crash course, mission from the moon [Me and my tech four]
Fuck a passport, I'm intergalactic
Get thru this bent and gin for my him, and then bury the hatchet
Fuck it, no games, stuck with Tefluck, 5, Billy &amp; Fame
Recognize the muthafuckin name
All hail the muthafuckin, Tefluck to So So Def
Nigga to ever escape from Sony
Alive, recognize I'm with 5, I get live on stage
Roamin a 4 Alarm Blaze to get mine
All day [Every day] to Broadway [Every day]
Freak the foreplay [All day] [Every day]
More catchy than poison ivy
So if ya wanna get involved with some gangsta shit
Then step lively
For real, still a ill [nigga] real [nigga] real [nigga]
We kill to the fuckin House of Kill niggas

[5 Ft.]
Head on collision, crash got the social in the smash
Like the sanitation apartment we get rid of the trash
5, Teflon, Fame, Billy Danze got the crowd jumpin out of the stands
Like rock bands
Goin to war, with heavy artillery, nobodies killin me
Twenty one gun salute, now you feelin me
Applayin the pressure, add a squeeze on the trigger
Rest in piece to Bloody Red, my nigga
When Brooklyn's in the house
It's time to shut 'em down
Let worldwide catastrophe, just happenin now
Reality, fillin the tragedies of apocalyptic casualties
Side to side with First Family, hot to the death
Gaspin for your last breath
It's critical conditions when the microphone is blessed

"That's right"

Chorus: 5 Ft. [Lil Fame] {Billy Danze}

Any attempts of violation
[Move on 'em, now, annihilation]
{And we vow to eliminate these habits
And the best is to eliminate these faggots}

[Billy Danze]
[It's the] hell raisin Berkowitz [love to submit]
To your click [clack clack] this whole clip
Chose the right soldier to roll wit, and roll thick
[First Family] and we take no shit
Puma hold me down, "that's right", that old bitch
Rip rounds from pounds and clowns that tips
[Give it to a nigga] in this Family we earn ours
Flexin, rolexxin your lesson step thru turn styles
And learn vows, if ya slump, get wild form
5 is a good man, and I flouse for him
Billy's blowin torches at innocent bistanders on porches
So be cautious, ofcourse it's a war
Goin all out side, and my family refuse to hide
Till I die

[Lil Fame]
Aiyo I'm on another mission
But yet, it's the same condition
When I kidnap ya ass, it'll be a rap dude missin
First Family, we all compatible, with the same game
With the same aim, to splatter you
We happen to be, them fly niggas
Move with the 5 Footer, here come dunn-dunn
Move in on them with the rough cats
Let me ask them bitch ass niggas a question
[Kid what's that?]
What make you think that I won't ride and dump this thing on you
Rain on you, word on the street is they say i'm thru
But you got rocked, blood stain on you
Nuttin left to do, I jump to my dammer
He trip me, so I empty my hammer
Brought him into my slaughterhouse, and I brought about
8 dub dubs, to straight roll on em, for life

Chorus 2X

Outro:
Yeah, yeah, hah
Teflon, 5, M.O.P. Fam Billy Danze
Here to annihilate on this annihilated track
Yeah, bringin it back
Droppin the bomb on the whole wideworld, yeah</pre>
