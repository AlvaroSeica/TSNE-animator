[Intro: Troy Ave]
You know I'm 'bout that N.Y.C. 
Powder! You want that dope shit fuck with me

[Chorus: Troy Ave]
Lifestyles of the rich and shameless
Some people get the change some go changeless
Some worry 'bout the name, wanna be famous
Some end up with they brain blown off by the stainless

[Verse One: Troy Ave]
I flip through the TV and I'm like yo ain't shit on
It's me Posh V.A. with the long hair thick joint
Massage her before I stroke her, she workin on my shoulders
But on a side note, where the fuck is Mayne Soda?!
Ain't see my nigga since we made a trade for them gats
I caught a body with his shit I hope he don't want it back
Frontin ass nigga deserved it please don't judge you ain't perfect
I hold court in the street, and murder was the verdict
Jewelry on, baby girl admires my ice
And it's my birthday, I did twenty five now life remains
I sip the pain and twist the jane hit the flame
I just want the money, fuck the fame
Be ashamed that they said Troy Ave that nigga
And my bank account sayin I got low ass figures
I am highly motivated by these broke ass niggas
Any funny moves know I blow smoke, BLAOW! 
Nigga!

[Chorus: Troy Ave]
Lifestyles of the rich and shameless
Some people get the change some go changeless
Some worry 'bout the name, wanna be famous
Some end up with they brain blown off by the stainless
Lifestyles of the rich and shameless
Some people get the change some go changeless
Some worry 'bout the name, wanna be famous
Some end up with they brain blown off by the stainless

[Verse Two: 2 Chainz]
My partner did a decade my code name Jefe
Plus I'm known to whip it, like Kunta Kinte
I form a side bitch so imagine what my lady got
Used a Maybach like the Marriott
Bought a foreclosed home, used it for a jewelry box a chain spot
Just ordered shrimp fried rice straight out the chinese spot
Organized crime if it was a team
I'd be on the starting five sippin lean with my guys
Havin the same cocaine nightmares
I wear jewelry like Nike airs, brick look like iPads
+Menace II Society+ guess I'm the new O-Dog
Typecast they think all I do is turnt up songs
You know my lifestyle, easy come easy go
The Panamera cleaner than a bar of soap
I stay level headed with a Guiseppe fetish
Guess it's hereditary 'cause my dad was a felon
Uh!

[Chorus: Troy Ave]
Lifestyles of the rich and shameless
Some people get the change some go changeless
Some worry 'bout the name, wanna be famous
Some end up with they brain blown off by the stainless</pre>
