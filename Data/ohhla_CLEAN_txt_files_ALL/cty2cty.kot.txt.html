Caribou Lou
Hella super dude

So bend it over baby
Let me see it pop
On this tour bus we party till the panties drop
You smell that green (green)
That's the kottonmouth
That's my family homie hold up what you talkin' 'bout
If it's negative
I don't want to hear it
Eliminatin' player haters with they evil spirits
Kansas City King
Kickin' it with the Kings
Take a whiff of weed and we for wicked things
Dang choices

From the back of the bus you hear strange noises

Going city to city stick a stick and move

Back room look gather 'round real quick
Bitch is sucking dick like carrots on a stick

Summertime madness is in full effect
It's a heat wave bitch so get undressed

[Chorus]
