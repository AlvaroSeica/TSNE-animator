[Verse 1]
It's the nicotine that brings the smokescreen
To my bigger dream, swept into the river stream
An inner beam of addiction
Now it's like I'm contradicting if you took the time to listen
Admitting that this shit just ain't right
But I'm tryna find the light, I smoke a pack a night
I might just get them patches
But right now could you please just pass those matches?
Spastic so I spark it up backwards
A short walk and I'm totally knackered
Another packet, wondering if my lungs will hack it
The fact is this is some sad shit
I got shear talent like Trem but it doesn't help when
My throat twists and bends with a buildup of phlegm
Suspense my projection and when I'm stepping
I get out of breath when I've exceeded my limits
I've cheated myself out of my fitness
Now I'm clouded with this shit
An intense stench that makes the wench wanna hide
I may look alright on the outer but you don't wanna see the inside
Charcoal, ash, black crap and gunk
I just wanna spit out this junk
A real punk in his truest form, the smoke does swarm
So now you've been warned cause I'm smoke stained

[Chorus]
I'm smoke stained (so smoke stained)
So smoke stained (yeah I'm smoke stained)
I'm smoke stained (you're so smoke stained)
Just so smoke stained (I'm smoke stained)
I'm smoke stained (so smoke stained)
Yeah I'm smoke stained (smoke stained)
I'm smoke stained (just so smoke stained)
So smoke stained (I'm smoke stained)

[Verse 2]
This ain't the shit that'll get you mellow
This is the smoke that'll make your fingers yellow
This is the wack shit that makes you feel real shallow
I was "Hello, Mrs. Ciggy"
She was quick to hit me, shifty and quite bitchy
Now it's like I fuck her fifty times in three days
I know there's more than three ways to get away
And now I believe you when you'd say it's a waste of your pay
I lay on my back and think maybe I should've got into the crack
Nah but seriously man I ain't fucking with that
Hope my lungs don't collapse
In fact I've got an aunt with emphysema 
That should be inspiration enough to get these lungs cleaner
But you're a dreamer if you think that'll make me stop
Now what I've got to do is chop down the numbers
Maybe a couple a week instead of like a hundred
Or none, that could bring my lungs up to the summit
With nice fresh air, let's hold that moment
And now I've spoke it, I'm choking the smoke back out there
My lungs are out there and I'm smoke stained

[Chorus]</pre>
