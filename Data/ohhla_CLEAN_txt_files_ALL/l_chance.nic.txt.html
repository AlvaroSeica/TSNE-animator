Yeah yeah
Oooooh yeah
Yo, I could've been had fame
Jumps shot with a stupid ass aim
Cause you couldn't get around the last name
So my crossover wins the last game
And it's ill, right
Switched up the flow, but it's still right
Go back to that, yea I still might
I'mma just do me, when it feel right, uh
You can bring it any day
Natural Bad Ass, NBA
That's my initials
That's why officials
Don't blow the whistle
Bang Bang the pistol
And I'm bossy
Can't keep these hoes up off me
Damn the flow nasty, coffee
Don't you do like the Pope and cross me

Chorus:
Yea this is my last chance ohhh, last chance ohhh
Yea this is my last chance, then shoot
I'm ready to shoot
I'm ready to shoot (ready to shoot)
I'm ready to shoot (ready to shoot)
I'm ready, I'm ready to shoot (ready to shoot)
I'm ready, I'm ready to shooooot
I'm ready to shoot
I get it in though
No sexual inuendo
Nobody that I can just depend on
Until I touchdown in the end zone
And then they come out like roaches
Pa Peck Pecking away like vultures
But little did they know
Distribute the payroll
Pick up the outfit, pick out the single
Sadly, I'm so business savvy
Similar protocol but the templates vary
Never been like me and never been like this
My flows are crisis
They scream in high pitch
Uh, gun cock, pause
And I'm well aware of the gun laws
Telling 'em that I'm gunning for the top, Forbes
Headed to the top dot org

Chorus:
Yea this is my last chance ohhh, last chance ohhh
Yea this is my last chance, then shoot
I'm ready to shoot
I'm ready to shoot (ready to shoot)
I'm ready to shoot (ready to shoot)
I'm ready to shoot (ready to shoot)
I'm ready to shooooot
I'm ready to shoot

All the days of my life I have been waiting for this time
Could you believe now it's right before my eyes
Anybody trying to stop me better not fuck with me this time
Shoot, I am ready to shoot into the sky
Chorus:
Yea this is my last chance (ohhh), last chance (ohhh)
Yea this is my last chance, then shoot
I'm ready to shoot
I'm ready to shoot (ready to shoot)
I'm ready to shoot (ready to shoot)
I'm ready to shoot (ready to shoot)
I'm ready to shooooot
I'm ready to shoot

I've only one chance one bullet in the gun
This is my life and I only got one yea
The safeties off and I put it on stun
Ohh stick 'em up, stick 'em up (ready to shoot)
I've only one chance one bullet in the gun
This is my life and I only got one yea
The safeties off and I put it on stun
Ohh stick 'em up, stick 'em up (ready to shoot)
Yeah yeah
I'm ready to shoot
This is my life and I only got one yea
The safeties off and I put it on stun
Get ready
I'm ready to shoot</pre>
