Verse 1: (A-Lexxus)

Since you fucked up, now you fallin' cause I be dissin'
Never thought you would be missin all the huggin' and kissin'
Never knew you would play me just like Mo B.'s piano
I flip the channel, keepin' niggas warm just like flannels
Me and Mercedes sticking up for all the bitches that's hot
Keep on brawlin' on these niggas, let 'em know we don't stop
In the Lexo or Esco, always for you the shit
Just because he say he love you don't mean he gotta hit it

Verse 2: (Mercedes)

Since your lady who I've been, want your lovin around your friends
You tried to be a snake and you thought up in the hood
There's just one thing you overlooked, my love was already booked
Got another man so how does it feel

Chorus: (Mercedes)

You didn't want my love when you could have it
(Now I'm on my own)
So don't you come knocking on my door
You didn't want my love when you could have it
(Now I'm on my own)
So don't you come knocking on my door

Verse 3 : (Mr. Serv-On)
Stay still, let me see the angle on that ass
I'm whats happening now, call him, tell him he done pass, don't ask
If I know what to teach
Let me breath five inches from your waist, ten inches from your knees
Say please cease, all that bullshit
Ain't bout no money shorty, you know I wear tanks so you know I'm rich click
The lights off, so let me wet your Vicky Secrets off
You know I can't hit it soft, I see you still at a loss
It's me you know and nothing in between, make you scream
Hug your ass like some Guess jeans, you know what I mean
He's your problem, I'm what you need and down to take
I know one hundred ways in this world to make your legs shake

Chorus: (Mercedes)

You didn't want my love when you could have it
(Now I'm on my own)
So don't you come knocking on my door
You didn't want my love when you could have it
(Now I'm on my own)
So don't you come knocking on my door</pre>
