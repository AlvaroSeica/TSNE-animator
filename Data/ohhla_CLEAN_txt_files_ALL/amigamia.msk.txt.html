Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I can't keep letting you trying to run my life
but I made the wrong decision cut the tension the knife
and I'm struggling trying hard not to tumble
it's like every single day I'm getting in some kind of trouble
I had it hard and you seem to make it easy
smiled when I looked into your face yea you pleased me
you did things for me I've never seen before
and I'm stuck with you hope you show me more
show me I don't gotta shed another broken tear
tell me that I'll be alright I got nothing to fear
show me that you'll always be around you'll never leave
tell me that I'll be the one who won't end up asleep
let me see the end of my fantasy
and let me show the world what I came to be
don't want any problems but I know that your about
you always seem to take the words that come out of my mouth

Even when I'm all alone and I can't go on you keep me going strong till the pain is gone [x2]

Gracias ati eh comprendido la felicidad es nuestra
verte ala cara se por qe esto me cuesta
y por qe tengo qe aser lo qe me dices
lo qe se necesita para no ponernos tristes
cada dia es necesario ir a verte
se qe no me falla seguro como la muerte
si algo pasa entre nosotros ni me fijo
me das lo qe te pido en la sonrisa
esta el delito no te preocupes nunka boi
abandonarte necesito qe me ayude
ah arreglar este desastre seguire dandote flores
y alagos dejando yo mis penas tu y yo seremos magos
te prometo guadare esto con mi vida cuando
sea yo como tu ya estare yo mas tranquila no me importa
lo qe digan de nosotros al final me parare
y buscare en mi tu rostro

Even when I'm all alone and I can't go on you keep me going strong till the pain is gone [x2]

You continue to make me be the best I can be
so now I can't let you go you become me
you've always held it down when I needed you
took me away from the pain when I went to you
you seem to care more than anyone ever did
and how we came to meet that's irrelevant
I won't go back to what I knew before you
I'm happy here and it's a pleasure to know you
I'm hoping that you can help me keep dreaming
pushing me on when I feel that I'm sinking
letting me know that I'm beautiful all day talking to me
where I need to be one day helping me on when I can't take it no more
and when I battle myself and I start war
drying my tears when I'm all out of laughter
and complementing my eyes minutes after

Even when I'm all alone and I can't go on you keep me going strong till the pain is gone [x2]</pre>
