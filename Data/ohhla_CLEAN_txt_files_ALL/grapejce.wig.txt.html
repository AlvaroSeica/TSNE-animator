[Shawn Wigs]
You spit 24 bars, I spit 8, double my weight
Get money like bumping nicks for twenties out of state
Your talk is cheap, verbally assault you quick
But all that up north talk is pork, I pump like bricks
From the streets to the sticks of Maryland Heights
And my mic is too hot for my wrist to hold ice
Barbeque buds smell the fruit loops like Toucan
Smoke the M-E-T-H, but no O.D., Man
Blue cans, blew order then a grape juice can
It's Theodore, pa, that's more than a few, fams
Wristbands, rock around my legs and forearms
Got more style in one verse than you got in three songs</pre>
