My name is drama my name is drama

My name is drama my name is drama

My name is drama my name is drama

My name is drama D-R-A-M-A

Nigga I done told ya nigga I'm a fold ya
Nigga I'm a roller puffin on nothing but doujah
Drama be a fool drama be a clown
Nigga dodgin and movin everytime I come around
Left right left motherfucker keep it in step
You heard my anthem drama done found them
Niggaz close your mouth cause you don't wanna walk the walk
I hear you loud and clear but you just talkin the talk
So what I'm a real nigga who don't give a fuck
So I advise you not to trip nigga and press your luck
Been trained for combat so nigga don't act
My guillotine is strapped GA on the map
My killers throwin grenades point 8 the gauge
Fingers on the trigga down south nigga

Chorus 1x

Load nigga cock nigga bust watch you drop
Point blank range till it go till it go no mercy
I'm true till I die and that's no lie
Wanna stop me don't try for sure you gon die
Marchin with my guillotine 1-2-3
Do haters wanna see me dead but that won't be
My troops and killers you don't want now day
And strap grenades and keep a chopper okay
Nigga I'm a hardhead my eyes they stay red
Thirteen years of pushin cain in the game okay
Nigga what's my name
D-R-A-M-A nigga that's my name

Chorus 1x

Soon as I stepped up out of jail my nigga Rob B signed me
Gave me some common cheeseand told me nigga it's on
Fuck some arbon mist we sippin don parion
Tight 2 def with the twentys out so nigga you besta bounce
Cause we makin big scrilla and nigga thats on the reala
The 2000 John Wayne bustin brains bringin pain

Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

John Wayne I'm the 2000 John Wayne nigga that's my alias
