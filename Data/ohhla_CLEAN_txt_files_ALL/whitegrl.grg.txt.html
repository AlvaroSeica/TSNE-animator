I love them white girls {*3X*}
I love them
I love them white girls {*3X*}

She got junk in her trunk
Love them white girls, 'specially when they get drunk
I love them white girls, the way she strut her stuff
I love you white girls; I just can't get enough
I love them white girls - used to have a flattie
I love you white girls; now y'all got the fattie
Just can't get enough
I just can't get enough {*3X*}

I love them white girls {*3X*}
Love them white girls
Man I love them white girls
I love them white girls {*2X*}
Man I love them white girls

I love them white girls, bleached blonde and pretty blonde
I love them white girls, girl y'all got it goin on
I love them white girls, redhead and brunettes
I love them white girls, and y'all ain't seen nothin yet
I love them white girls, way they walk the runway
I love them white girls, the way they let it all hang
I love them white girls, the way they do that pole
I love them white girls, the ones with no pantyhose

I love them white girls {*3X*}
Man I love them white girls {*2X*}
I love them white girls {*2X*}
Man I love them white girls

I love them white girls, big ones, tall ones
Skinny ones, small ones, I love 'em all
I love them white girls, the way they do that thang
I love them white girls, they ain't afraid to show they thang
I love them white girls; they go to work in the day
I love them white girls, they come out night time and play
I love them white girls, they sip so mysterious
I love them white girls, they make me delirious

I love them white girls {*3X*}
Love them white girls
Man I love them white girls
I love them white girls {*2X*}
Man I love them white girls

I love them</pre>
