[Pennywise]
Roqy really hates Christmas and I don't know why
It's the best time of year where everybody feels fine
Santa musta never made a stop at his crib
It's either that or maybe he was just a really bad kid
Or maybe it's the idea of Santa havin elves
Trying to make 'em do the work that he should probably do himself
Or maybe it's the banks and corporations tryin to cash in
We just wanna know and that's the reason why we askin
Why you gotta be a Scrooge? Look at Tiny Tim
The last spirit of the story had the future lookin grim
So why you hate Christmas? I think you need to tell
before I turn your ringtone into a bunch of sleigh bells (Yo)

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
[Ran] What you got against Christmas, Roq?
[Mir] Was it cause you didn't get gifts a lot?
[Pen] Is it cause you think we forgot what it means?
[Ran] Or are you really that mean? (Tell me)

[Mr. Miranda]
Now RoQy, I know that you don't really like Christmas
But livin just ain't livin if you don't have a wish list
That's a bummer to me, I know you don't have to be gifted
to open gifts under a tree; but it's all about family time
And Christmas shopping's a workout like P90X insanity grind
Folks out buyin trees, Christmas lights
Hot chocolate, gingerbread houses, it's just nice
to be around all the people you care for
It should happen always but this the time people will share more
Lil' kids tryin to pull mo' clothes
So they can go and shine brighter than Rudolph's nose - ha~!

[Chorus]

[Random]
Yo - Mr. TyRaiD, tryin to understand where you comin from
Most holidays are pretty cool, but some of them
are blown outta proportion, some would say they all are
Ridiculous excuses to run out and buy a Hallmark
card but Christmas, it's deeper than that
Deeper than the toys the big man keeps in his sack
All the gifts we get in this life? Gotta appreciate
The things people do for you dog - think you need to take
a look at what we goin through right now
Think about how many people would kill to have your lifestyle
It's enough sadness for all the days on the calendar
Wo take a day off qne a load off, I challenge ya
Let yourself go and discover the true essence
And wait- are you saying that you dont accept presents?
{"Stop lyin!"} Start tryin
Take the coal he gave you and turn it to a diamond

[Chorus]

[RoQy TyRaiD]
Past Christmases all that mattered was fam and religion
Now it's propaganda and capitalism
Can't have a tradition without the corporations' association
Everything that's sacred and wholesome is tainted
There's no inspiration in mistletoe kisses
Obligated dinners and gift exchanges, I'm sick of fakeness
You forgive the mistakes, cause it's the holidays  
But won't pay 'em a visit when it's NOT when they're a mile away! 
Lame songs and eggnog, thank God it's just a day long
I'm a Grinch, I know
I just refuse to be convinced you're in a sentimental mood
Forget the presents, throw the residents of Whoville off the Cliff
(noooooooooo) along with the holiday cheer
It gets earlier and earlier, it started mid-August this year!
I DO accept and give gifts, let's not be mistaken
I just don't need a special day to show my appreciation
{*HUMBUG!*}

[Outro]
Let me tell you what Christmas is alright?
Christmas is spendin money you don't have
on stuff you don't need, for people you don't like
C'mon Christmas is a holiday that's all about deception
Santa comin down chimneys? He's obviously a thief, c'mon
Rudolph the Rednosed Reindeer is obviously a coke addict
Better to give than to receive? Are you serious?
You know who else thinks that way? Rapists
C'mon now, and don't get me started on the music
