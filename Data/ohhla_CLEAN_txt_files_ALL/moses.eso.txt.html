Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Yeah
Hell Yeah
This that dance where, no one's looking
You can do whatever the fuck you feel like doing man that's the Moses twist to me

I'm the shepherd of these letters
Watch them dance with my essence
Waitin this in space with a hand clutching heaven
So answer the question do you like to get down?
Hell Yeah
I'll be twisting every time I hit town

Lets bounce to the spot where the ounce of the bar
Where the sound doesn't stop where I found what I lost
Fear doesn't live in my heart or my mind I've escaped to a place where the stars are aligned
(Together forever)
We hunt for a new view
Like it only comes once in a blue moon
Let the room spin dust your shoulders off
And lets ride till we fly like motor cross
And well show the boss
Who'll have nothing on us
Well have our little piece of paradise I fucking promise
So until that day they'll fear the man of magic
Simply cause his ideas are panoramic
And everybody do the Moses twist, everybody do the Moses twist
Now do the Moses twist, everybody do the Moses twist
Do the Moses, do the Moses, do the Moses twist
Do the Moses, do the Moses, do the Moses
Yeah
Well I'm back in the kitchen
I bust my transmission
And pour myself a cup of ambition
Attack my plans with the winners execution
This is the twist of my inner revolution
It's the sun and the breeze
It's the clean bill of health
Whether science or religion just believe in yourself
The real leap of faith when your lost in transit
Deep in space as we spin in this cosmic dance
Summer time highway just me and my girl
The movement to be the change you want to see in the world
The corrupt and tangled network
Run by annual net worth
The fly head first with the love to stand and grab earth
So part the sea man, make your own advancements a step of independence
Obey your own commandments
And live your openness wake up and sniff the roses
And waltz through your world when with a twist of Moses (Soldiers)
Do the Moses, do the Moses, do the Moses twist.
Do the Moses, do the Moses, do the Moses twist.
Do the Moses, do the Moses, do the Moses twist.
Do the Moses, do the Moses
I eclipse when I twist with my missus and our dog
Love freeze framed like a visit from the gods
It's the wizards of the oz with the colors on the easel
It's my worlds nature the mother of my people
It's the sun dance moon walk
Swing of my system
The boogie to my baby
With my wings making rhythm
All the ocean of emotion
It's the acquire of the pirates
The chance of a lifetime
The fire of my iris
Out on these open planes
I touch the stars above
Face to face with my fate
I know it's hard to touch

Out on these open planes
I touch the stars above
Face to face with my fate
I know it's hard to touch
And everybody do the Moses twist, everybody do the Moses twist
Now do the Moses twist, everybody do the Moses twist
Now do the Moses twist, everybody do the Moses twist
Now do the Moses twist, everybody do the Moses twist
Do the Moses, do the Moses, do the Moses twist
Do the Moses, do the Moses, do the Moses twist
Do the Moses, do the Moses, do the Moses twist
Do the Moses, do the Moses, do the Moses</pre>
