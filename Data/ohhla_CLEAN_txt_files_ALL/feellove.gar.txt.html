[Intro - Sean Garrett - talking]
Damn (huh), I thought I had it all (huh) figured out (huh)
Especially when it came to relationships (okay) and girls (huh)
But just when I least expected it (huh)
Love, rearranged my whole world (okay)

[Verse 1 - Sean Garrett]
Junior high, played 'em, high school, played 'em
College, well, you know, played 'em
Me and my friends used to laugh about it, how we fade 'em
Now Cupid's aimin his arrow right there at me
(No more nonchalant), can I be, with you here, starin at me
With the most beautiful eyes that a nigga ever seen
You pull an emotional vibe from my soul, look at me
You got my heart beatin like my back is filled with batteries

[Chorus - Sean Garrett] - w/ ad libs
For the first time I'm in love
And I wanna tell everybody
And I wanna tell everybody what I'm feeling
For the first time I feel love
And I wanna tell everybody
And I wanna tell everybody

J. Cole, big bro, speak

[Verse 2 - J. Cole]
Not so fast, Cole got a whole lot of lotto cash
Life of a bachelor, light skinned rapper, found a top model with a Tahoe ass
With a broad so bad, when she cross your path
You get her out of them jeans, you be thinkin about rings, okay she done got your ass
Cupid done shot your ass but I'm tryin to be a G though
See yeah I'm gonna holla, yeah I'm gonna collar/call her but I ain't got a leash though
Uh, I put her name on a lease though, made an extra set of my keys for her
I think I might wife it now but life is foul and you don't got a free throw
Uh, and so my next move, gon' have to be my best move
Beside every King is a bad ass Queen, so girl let's make this chess move

[Chorus 2] - w/ ad libs
For the first time I'm in love
And I wanna tell everybody
And I wanna tell everybody what I'm feeling
For the first time I feel love
And I wanna tell everybody
And I wanna tell everybody the feeling

[Verse 3 - Sean Garrett]
Now baby, baby
You doin things with my heart ain't never felt, it's so crazy
Had to agree to acknowledge love or refuse to let it change me
I was so mistaken
Your love like a Bentley coupe, took me out of a Mercedes
Now baby, baby
For so long I met somebody, my heart just been dazed with
I went from not wantin a girlfriend to needin ya lady
I didn't think I'd ever see
Me callin to hear ya voice before I go to sleep

[Chorus 2] - w/ ad libs

[Verse 4 - Sean Garrett]
I ain't never looked into a woman's eye and felt the fire
That I'm feelin while you holdin me, beggin to take you higher
For so long I wasn't faded, I couldn't admit it before
But now I see what life's about and I'm never gonna let ya go
Girl I'm growin (no longer wanna be selfish, I wanna be more accountable)
I see us growin (no longer do I wanna miss out on a feeling I ain't never had before)
I got to tell the world, somebody gotta know
What you done done to me, I gotta let 'em know

[Chorus 2] - w/ ad libs

[Verse 5 - J. Cole]
(I swore) I swore I'd never fall (never fall) but I fell (no), run and tell all my old hoes
Erase my number, my photos (my photos)
Uh, baby girl, pardon me
But, don't text, stop callin me (callin me)
I ain't your nigga, don't bother me (bother me)
Fuck your Twitter, don't follow me (follow me, no more)
My new girl, too thorough, believe it or not man, she's all I need
Thought I was a player, R.I.P.
Down goes Frazier, call Ali
Let's hit the mall and it's all on me
'Cause girl you deserve it
If I take this chance and make these plans, I gotta know girl, is you worth it? (perfect)</pre>
