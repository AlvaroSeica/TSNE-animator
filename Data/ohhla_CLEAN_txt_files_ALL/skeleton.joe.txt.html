[Chorus: Kaydence]
I got some skeletons locked in the closet (yeah, yeah)
And I've been dyin, dyin just to find an outlet (yeahhhhhh)
And I'm hopin that no one finds out about it (yeah, yeah)
Wishin maybe it'll disappear but I doubt it, I doubt iiiiiiiit

[Joell Ortiz]
Uhh, damn
I look over my shoulder not knowin where it's comin from
But knowin that it's comin, I was buggin as a young'n
Now I'm runnin from, or somethin that'll even out my dumb decisions
The night I shot and had him bleedin out his lungs and spittin
Do any sins go unforgiven?
I hope not cause most of mine were hunger-driven, nothin in my mother kitchen
Stomach soundin like the clouds ignited and the thunder hittin
So the well-screwed kid ended up with more than a couple missin
So not a chef but now the cocaine forever cookin
I love kids but now I'm sellin to a pregnant woman
Stumblin through the projects in the A.M. with a cup in my hand
Gun on my waist and, I don't give a FUCK is my plan
You'll never understand my palm sweat
Followed by shortness of breath then my heart jets and I ain't find a calm yet
Go on let shorty sing
Cause ain't no way in Hell this ain't Joell that's brave enough to tell you e'rything

[Chorus]

[Crooked I]
Fuck all that rappin, I'ma let the conversation rock
I got skeletons in my closet
The livin dead live in a nigga head behind a combination lock
When will the occupation stop it, make it a vacant lot
The black mamba when I crack vodka, I'ma take a shot
and hope them stowaways go away, before the anchor drop
Yo thanks a lot, I'm a bottle drinkin nutcase
Cover of XXL behind Em, I had the drunk face
I steadily dream about cleanin these demons out
In order to clean 'em out, you gotta scream and shout, all of your secrets out
loud; it started as a kid at my school desk
Aced every quiz but I wanted to pass the cool test
Ain't nothin cool about school shoppin at the thrift store
And livin in an abondoned station wagon because you was piss poor
So I started stealin all of the clothes that the other kids wore
That's when the skeletons moved into my mind on the sixth floor
And more came through Crooked I's youth
I slowly started movin 'em out my closet into this mic booth
For real bro

[Chorus]

[Interlude: Kaydence]
I thought I had it locked away 'til forever
But no memories fade away, they seem to stay
Comfortable in my conscience you live in my dreams
They say time heals it all, then why's this pain still with me?

[Joe Budden]
Uh uh, uhh
See the problem is I know it all, or maybe the problem is that I just show it all
Maybe they thinkin that I should be ashamed of my actions but really there's no remorse
Maybe the Lord'll decide that I suffered enough and let me live with no withdrawals
Then again all it would mean is he deemed that I'm much too important to focus all
We could talk about pain 24/7, dawg that's my department
"Inner City Blues," cruise and I'm blastin that Marvin
Skeletons ain't in my closet, that's my apartment
And they like to hide behind thousand dollar fabrics and garments
It's all bleak to me
Tell my pop I ain't bothered when he don't speak to me, I love you but it's weak to me
On one hand life is short and there's no excuse to do it
But you was missin half my life dawg, I'm kinda used to it
Modern day Son of Sam, judge but you don't understand
Me against the world, I plan on winnin, know I'm on demand
Wan' see through the eyes of a monster? Look through my glasses tint
My roommates can stay here, just take care of half the rent

[Chorus]

[Outro: Kaydence]
I doubt iiiiiiiit, ayy
I doubt iiiiiiiit, ayy
I doubt it {*fades out*}
