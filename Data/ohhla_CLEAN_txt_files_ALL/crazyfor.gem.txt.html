Chorus:
[MC Magic] Have you ever met somebody that will
           Love you like I do (Love you like I do)
           I'm goin' crazy
           Crazy for you
[Female]   And have you ever known somebody
           That would give it all for you
           I'm goin' crazy
[Both]     Crazy for you

[Big Gemini]
(Verse 1)
I've always
Been by myself, live life by myself
Never cared for solitude, just cared for the wealth
Steady stackin', never slackin', with no time to be wasted
While these other dudes chasin' broads, I was chasing that paper
But then (But then)
Came you (Came you)
And it was, over baby, I was, goin' crazy
For you
And I ain't felt this way in a minute
And I ain't gon' lie to you mama, [{*shit*}], I'm startin' to dig it
For real

Pre-Chorus:
[MC Magic] Everything about you is what I like (About you)
           I go crazy and I lose my mind
           Trade my world and I give my life
[Female]   Cause it feels so right

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 2)
And everyday, you make it clear that you don't wanna be replaced
Just by them little things you do, just by them little things you say
Five years done past
And we done went through some drama
From court dates to miscarriages, to you losin' your mama

Bridge: Big Gemini
But now (But now)
I see (I see)
That you my, one and only, baby
Oh, I'm goin'
Crazy
I can't eat (Can't eat)
Can't sleep (Can't sleep)
No more, no more

(Verse 3)
It's like I toss and turn at night
Memories is my pain
I keep hearin' you laughing
Screaming, callin' my name
Then my eyes open wide
And I see you ain't there
Then the joy from them years, they turn into a permanent tear
Of ink

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 4)
My only sanity in these walls is just the thought of you
Paradise up in my mind just for a second or two
But then it's gone (All gone)
And I gotta go, too
Because I change my ways, ma, I'm comin' home to you
For real

Repeat Chorus</pre>
