[Intro]
WARNING~! Yo
Multiman, Big Cat Records (remix!)
Yo (Quick flip, Big Cat, yo)
Yo, yoooooooooo

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
She's a very freaky gurl (yeah) don't bring her to mama (geah)
First you get her name (name) then you get the number (number)
Then you get some brain in the front seat of a Hummer
Then you get some brain in the front seat of a Hummer

[Gucci Mane]
The Range Rove, the Lambo', the ride and the 'Rarri
If I wasn't rappin then I'd be robbin
Probably, pull out my Jag tomorr-ay
Evisu jeans and they saggin darlin
Shoes by Prada, shirt {?}
Pull up to the park in somethin foreign
Tangerine Porsche, same color of orange
I stay real hot like my car insurance

[Chorus]

[Verse Two]
Ay, ay Maceo, flow be hot, you think yours is but your flow is not
Pulled up in a 'draulic drop so hot all the females come and flock
They be like his fresh so mean, futuristic stupid jeans
All the hoes wanna piece of me but you know you gotta be a superfreak
Go ahead get on your knees, and got to beg and plead
You know the deal when you fuckin 'round with a O.G.
I make you OD, I get you superwet
I like these women slimmies, cause we can't slide cassettes

[Chorus]

[Interlude]
You're listenin to the toughest ras claat, Multiman
Big Cat Records (WARNING~!)

[Gucci Mane]
Don't be conceited girl, I know you'll eat a girl
I know yo' secret girl, but I'm gon' keep it girl
Oh youse a college girl? Come be a Gucci girl
Oh youse a Gucci fan? Let's go to Gucci Land
You diggin Gucci Mane, cause only Gucci can
Drop a stack, pop your back with the rubberband
You diggin Gucci Gucci, let's do the oochie-coochie
Oh that's yo' girlfriend? Why don't you introduce me

[Chorus]</pre>
