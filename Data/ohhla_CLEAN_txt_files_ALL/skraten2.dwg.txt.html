Mash grind, dollar sign,
Thug love, get it crunk,
Smokin' hay, gettin' drunk,

Wide eyed, Hustlas cuz,

Paper green, dope fiends,
Hittin' hard, college Park,
Y'all ain't ready for them chevys,
Sittin' stank, on that drank,

Pour me some, here I come,
Y'all ain't ready for them chevys,
Peel them sacks in Cadillacs,
Brand new fours with standard spokes,
With a candy paint and razor game,
What's up in your mouth is what?
All I wanna do is thug,
Lip service and I'm gone,
Now watch me get my serve on,
