Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Intro/Outro]
I was just sittin on my sofa
Now the weight of the world is up on my shoulders
Average men became soldiers
The day the robots took over

[Chorus]
(Unplug!) Before the machines get ahold of you
(Unplug!) You flip the switch but who's controllin who?
(Unplug!) Before the machines get ahold of you
(Unplug!) You turn it on but who's controllin who?
(We gotta unplug!) Before the machines get ahold of you
(We gotta unplug!) You press the buttons but who's controllin who?
(We gotta unplug!) You press the buttons but who's controllin who?
(We gotta unplug!) You press the buttons, but...

Yo~! My GPS froze can't get directions
I need Google or Siri, just to answer questions
I change the channel every ten seconds
Can't function if I lose my internet connection
Outta my zone, if I lost my phone
I wouldn't even know the number to my momma's home
And even if I have a lousy waiter
I can't get the tip straight without usin a calculator
Sometimes I want +MySpace+ like Timberlake
But when I can't get it, I can't get it straight
It's impossible to innovate
Roadblocks on the information interstate
Coud it be another side effect of inner hate?
Hungry wolves snatchin portions off my dinner plate
Cause it's sickening; even when I'm in the club
I get pinged all night by every site that I'm a member of
Seem like I'm not even me any more
Went from social butterfly to social media whore
And we all seen the pictures and signs from the scriptures
Sayin false idols'll get'cha!
But still we slaves to technology
And I don't see a way out comin but yo there's gotta be
My philosophy is this: why waste time with setbacks?
Cause time is the only thing that you can't get back

[Chorus]

[Random]
You know what? All the stuff I used to commit to memory
They threw it outta schools - now they just let 'em be
And they call it useless
Cause nobody's gonna ask you what the surface area of Duluth is
We used to learn from our mistakes
Now I can't try cause I got no time to waste
I heard 'em say somethin: why waste time with setbacks?
Cause time is the only thing that you can't get back
Yet, I used to enjoy our heated arguments
Now a trip to Wikipedia quickly ceases all of it
You know where I be at, you know why I can't relax
Was told I need to +Detox+, all I did was +Relapse+
I was late to work because of my alarm
While a kid used his PS3 to arm a bomb
I try to say it's just what us kids do
Technology is a tool - but a crutch is too y'know?
