[Makeba Mooncycle]
I was scorched by fire, purified by the flames
Stepped into the arena, lead by pain
It's insane I present me, but nobody knows
Gave the power of life to a tree, so anything goes
Don't underestimate my condition, and before my prediction
Gave birth to a prince, overstand my accent
Named my seed Jihad, prepared him for war
Holier than me, he's the leader of the core
The war's long been awaited, highly segregated
Who's got the front line, I'm ready to take mine
Protecting my seeds like I'm a Terminator
Call me, Queen Destructor, MC regulator
See the world so unknown, you don't even know the half
Lessons are given to living, still don't do the math
Sometimes I feel shit, I give myself so much
Falling from grace, to lose Midas touch
It's so easy to be evil, with savages riding me
Like Joker said, 'get this devil up out of me'

[Chorus 3X: Makeba Mooncycle]
I present me, and what they gonna give me
They wanna keep me, and lock me down

[Makeba Mooncycle]
The reiteration from my tongue and show me to be the Lunar one
So call me my golden child, on time like a sundial
A place has been chosen, for which I am seeded
Three hundred sixty degrees, then I get heated
Yes it's the Moon, illuminate your doom
Give off light when detected, like body armor, I'm protected
The birth of a star, reflects on my Sun
Now bow your head to the chosen one
Reflection of knowledge, just displays my wisdom
Putting heads to bed, on the clef of my bossom
Those who oppose, me sware, cuz they try
Trying to get off, when you had no alibi
Fuck up contagious, like a sky, clear ya third eye
Yes the Trinity will elevate your mental
Illuminating all causes with the stroke of my pencil
How to say it, chipped out what you wish
Because it's a ride, doesn't make it a trip
Use choice words for your phrases, cuz after writing scrolls of pages
Through all my stages, to receive praises, blessed by sages
My weight speaks in tongue, bows out the Moon to uplift my Sun....

[Chorus 6X]</pre>
