Uhh, uhh
Geah, geah, uh
Yo

You was there when I lost Uncle Bobby
I needed a hobby, nobody beside me
to guide me or probably provide me, with an out
So I spit it out, just can't figure out
It's Godly, gotta be, how I do it properly
Big Ben with ink pens, swat at every shot at me
Possibly my lifeline, I write rhymes
that might find they place next to icons
Let your light shine, I was told quite a while ago
Now the boy can remember like the Alamo
Nine-three a team with big dreams
that hit scenes and shared the wealth like a split screen
Now it seems, things is quite different
Cats make mills that don't even like spendin
I bring the truth like goggles with night vision
Bring it to the heavens, somebody might listen
But hey

Y'knahmsayin?
There's been times in my life where
hip-hop has literally saved my life where
I was caught up in situations that
My boys had got caught up in
But because I was in the crib
writin rhymes or listenin to beats
I was able to get out of that situation
So I owe hip-hop

Aiyyo - how you gon' say that Ra ain't sick?
True talent ain't measured by MySpace hits
I know God gave gifts, he gave me some nice mitts
to get a tight grip and I ain't slipped
Still yet, holdin on like Dawn without the other chicks
(HOLD ON!) Provin intelligence ain't quite irrelevant
Shows in different +Area Codes+ is +Ludacris+ (I, got, jokes)
When I was doin this, didn't know what to do with this
Couple seconds away from sayin I'm through with this (yes)
Despite my despair, I made intuitive
raps, the most expressive form of art
But thanks to creative it's thrown apart
But hip-hop's in YOU as a matter of fact
So hip-hop ain't dead 'til you flat on your back, yo
Rappers gettin got left and right
So while I'm here I'ma bless the mic
Sho' you right

I like talkin to my homies
And, and they always tryin to tell me they like
"Yo man, you you made it man"
I be like "I ain't make nothin yet man"
Cats be like "Yo when you gon' get signed man?"
And I'm like "Is that really the ultimate goal?
To put your music into somebody else's hands?"

The websites say underrated, views say overlooked
Labels say it's raw, streets say overcooked (yeah)
They tellin me I got that Kanye sound
So I'ma "Touch the Sky" 'fore it "All Falls Down"
Until "Jesus Walks" on Earth, I'ma hold down my turf
When worst come to worst, every verse that I burst
put a G up in the purse, fell down but
I ain't hurt, pluck the dirt off shirt (c'mon)
Put in work like a temp agency
from A to Z and you ain't changin me (nah)
Cause no rap cat is the same as me
Cause they ain't got as much love for the game as me
And my boys say that I made it, I ain't even on the doorstep
I think the greatest rapper ain't even been born yet
So the best is yet to come
And my journey to the top has just begun

Yeah, yeahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh...
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh-HAH~!</pre>
