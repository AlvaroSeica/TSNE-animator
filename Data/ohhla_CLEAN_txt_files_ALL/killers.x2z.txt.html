[Intro: Xzibit]
{*sniffling*} Ohh, I'm sorry man
I'm sorry man! {*crying*}
AHH MAN! I'm sorry dude!
Ah, ah, AHHHHHH! {*sobbing*}

[Chorus: Xzibit]
I'm sorry I met you, I'm sorry I hurt you
I'm sorry I killed you, I'm sorry I murked you
Cause I'm all alone now, nobody is with me
Nobody to threaten like they about to come get me
I wish I could go back to where we began
I wish you was alive so I can kill you again
Yeah, I wish we had more paths to cross
Nobody even cares or thinks about my loss
My killer's remorse

[Bishop Lamont]
It's funny how the same shit we laugh at
can be the very same shit that gets your bitch ass clapped
Your throat slit, neck snapped, drowned in your own pool out back
I'll kill your cats and dogs too but shit I don't count that
I'm the angel of death, I strangle 'til there's no breath
I kill and kill kill 'til there ain't nobody left
My conscience don't inhibit me, I kill deliberately
Tryin to be like God cause God kills indiscriminately
I'm so Christian, I'm so Muslim
Suicide bomb your mom crib if you push him
Parallel to hell, I'm ready so Satan what's cookin?
Rappers runnin they mouth, they don't know how close
they bitch asses come to gettin turned into ghosts
Nigga I will kill you, don't get it crossed
Memories fade just as blood washes off
I said memories fade just as blood washes off
Hope to see you soon

[Chorus]

[B-Real]
I feel so guilty, my hands are filthy
from decoratin your face all over the building
I'll say it sincere, if I ain't makin it clear
I'll write it on the wall with your blood, "Man I wish you were here"
But you moved on at your funeral, I'll read you Islam
I'll hug your mom, tell your sister and the kids to be calm
I won't tell 'em you're gone, you're just sleepin and dreamin on
C'est la vie, we smoked you like the weed in the bong

[Demrick]
Yeah! Have you ever seen a blood stain?
I know that person has returned from where he once came
Heh, regret is such an ugly thang
Only if you let it fuck with your brain
But it ain't gon' change a fuckin thang
What's done is done, chalk that shit up to the game
You're still dead while I'm still alive
And I never got the chance to utilize my best alibi!

[Chorus]

[Xzibit]
It started with bullshit, escalated to violence
In result of the violence infinite permanent silence
Now I feel empty, not even existing
My worst enemy is no longer against me
I remember the hatred, and how it consumed me
And you felt the same thing, but never could move me
A shot to the face, is nothin like in the movies
The back of your brain is out, the body keeps moving
So I should rejoice now, because you are past tense
The last of my enemies, the last of you bastards
The dirt on yo' casket, now I'm so alone now
You was my reason to carry my gauge and my chrome out
So now I just zone out, and wait for the contact
And live for the combat, but now we're beyond that
And I'll take it all back if I knew what I knew now
What's a shooter without somebody to shoot down?
Yeah~!

[Chorus]</pre>
