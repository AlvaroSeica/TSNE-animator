Now why you gotta cramp my style
You kep fuckin' with my high now I'm bout to get wild
Now why you gotta harass the pot dealer
Harass the people at expired parking meters
Why you gotta pull me over
As if I was the dude in the stolen Nova
Now why you gotta badge on your chest
Sting gun on your hip 
and a bulletproof vest
Now why you gotta act like you save the people
You front and you kid just so we can feel equal
Now why you gotta read me my rights
Would you read 'em to your wife
Fuck no Jesus Christ
Now why you gotta hang cuff me tight
In the middle of the nite 
Treat me like a murder type
Now why you gotta, gotta, gotta nuttin
Gotta get out my face
Bitch I know you like Dunkins

[Hook]
Tell me why
You wanna fuck with me
(Why you gotta)
Is it because I'm a Kottonmouth King
(Why you gotta)
No time for negivitity
So tell me why its always you against me

To the men,women and children
That are catchin or feelin'
Know waht I'm dealin what is delt with
Felt up in the melt
The laws ???????? flowin liquidfying lava
We could be makin it harder
Listen up and try to follow
Now, Why you gotta pull me over in my van
Give a ticket for gram it cost bout a grand
And why you gotta slow the fuck out your roll
I know I'm not speedin I'm in cruise control
So now you gotta find another reason why
You can stop flashin your lights 
dont have to viloate my rights ah
No you don't have let me say your alone
Pigs bust in your home guns drawn to your dome
Why you gotta have a chip on your shoulder
Pased the ?????? test I said I was sobber
I thought I told ya don't try to pull this on me
I know between procedure and police brutality
So tell me why, you insult me and gain stupidity
Why you think your smarter cause you GED
I get high and fly I dont drink and drive
And you fuckin with my flight so I gotta ask why

Tell me why
You wanna fuck with me
(why you gotta)
Is it because I'm a Kottonmouth King
(why you gotta)
No time for negitivity
So tell me why its always you against me

Now everytime I turn the corner
Cops all up in my business
Always tryin plan shit, Let me get a witness
Its gettin serious and funny to me
Another day another ticket takin money from me
Now they'd try to pull us over 
cause were bangin the bus
The Fish, Johnny Richter, myself and The Judge
Who can you trust when the worlds crupt
Its got the crokked ass cops that put my ass in cuffs

Whys the police always stressin other people
They say protect and serve yet the never treat us equal
All across the nation people strivin to be equal
Another uprisin they don't want to see the sequal
Why you think you don't need no invitation
They rushed up in my house it was a fucked up situation
Tearin' up my pad searchin for the cultivation
Justified these actions through your racist legislation

The thinker can't remember ever slippin in some shit
Windin up behind some bars with purple rings around my wrists
Havin' to wait 10 hours just to take a fuckin piss
When your name is just a number as a person you don't exist
When you realize that noone really gives a fuck
When you finally realize when you start to get back up
To many people I know for bullshit got locked up
To many times I asked why so now I gotta say wha

Tell me why
You wanna fuck with me
(why you gotta)
Is it because I'm a Kottonmouth King
(why you gotta)
No time for negitivity
So tell me why its always you against me

Why you gotta
Why you why you gotta
tell me why
Why you gotta why you gotta gotta gotta</pre>
