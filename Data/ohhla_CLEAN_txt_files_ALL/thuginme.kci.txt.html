He, he, he
Baby it's the thug in me
You know what time it is..

By age 13 I was buckwild
Good in my knucklegame
Made it through a tough childhood
Never be the same
Walked in my daddy's shoes
No time to be a peaceful man, had to shatter fools
That's 'til I put my eyes on you
Goddamn sweetheart
You got some thighs on you
Now I can't wait to get you home
Get you all alone in my bedroom
Baby can we bone and get it on?
Tell me lady how you like me
And if you want it harder, baby
Come and bite me, but do it lightly
Cuz that excites me when the lady bite
And if you lick me right I'll do it all night
Only got fucked by a drug dealer
Never felt the real passion of a thug nigga
Though I like the way you scream when you lovin' me
I'm goin deep, it's the thug in me
So whatcha sayin, girl?

1 - [K-Ci &amp; JoJo]
    A thug nigga like me
    Need a thug lady like you
    I got a lot of thug in me
    That I wanna put in you

Repeat 1

[K-Ci]
Woke up this morning
Feelin' kinda horny (he, he)
I want you to come over
To get some of this thug love
Tell me how you want it, girl
Tell me how you like it, girl
Tell me do you need it, girl
Don't try to fight it, come on

Repeat 1 (2x)

[K-Ci]
How do you want it?
I said toss it up
Let me be your dentist
Let me floss it up
Tell me how you want it
Tell me how you need it
Tell me how you like it
Don't try to fight it, no

Repeat 1 (2x)

[2Pac]
Moan baby when we bone, it's on
It's so strong niggas in the next room will cum
I got your head swinging
Tongue kissing as I hit it from the back
With the bed ringing, he he
Give me space as I lick your face
Stick the place sychronized so I grind
When they kick the bass
Love fucking in the mornin'
I get you wet, bust a sweat, then I'm gone
Left you on your own, girl
Tell me what you feel like
Blindfolded I'm cold do it real nice
That's if it feel right
Maybe it's the thug in me
I pull your hair while we fucking in the chair
When you loving me up against the wall
You can have it all, just try
Bet my kiss can get you high
Don't pass by
Grab me by my nuts when I'm loving you
Now open up and let me put the thug in you

Repeat 1 (4x)

[2Pac]
I don't got no motherfucking expectation
You know what I'm saying
You see don't be asking me what I be pulling your hair
Or why I fuck so damn much
It's that thug passion know what I mean?
No mercy
What you scared of? (I ain't scared)
Did you come over her to get fucked? (yeah)
You ain't come over here to get strokin' and all that bullshit
You came over her to get fucked
I fuck you thug style baby
You leave my house sayin' 2pac game served you
Don't have me crossed up in that bullshit (okay)
Turn it up (okay baby)
Baby it's the thug in me (yeah)

*girl moans in background*

A lot of y'all fuckers heard Whatz Ya Phone Number?
And thought y'all could fuck with me in the bedroom
It ain't going down
As long as they make Ginseng and condoms
Bitch you outta luck
I don't got no motherfuckin explanation
My motherfuckin motto
Baby it's the thug in me...</pre>
