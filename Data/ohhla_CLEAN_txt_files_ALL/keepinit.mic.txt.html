[Chorus 2X: Iron Mic]
Ruthless, my hood is keepin' it
Ruthless, you hood is keepin' it
Ruthless, yet, we all keepin' it
Ruthless, we keep it

[Iron Mic]
From L.A. to New York City, Chi-Town, back down to Philly
I need ya'll to rock with me
Cuz Iron Mic, ya'll, I'm up next
Can't forget my people down south, and all my fam out in the mid west
And all my niggas overseas, posted up on the corners where you live
Take a sip, nigga, roll you tree
It's Ruthless, ya'll, we in the building
I mean that, we in the project, making a killing
So lean back and enjoy the feeling
You in the club, move girl, show me how you feeling
You in your whip, painless, let me hit you peeling
Burn rubber, muthafucka, just control the stearing
You wanna bite, throw it up, nigga, you in a gang
Let ya bandana hang, if you bang, throw it up, nigga
But slow it up, nigga, cuz you know you can't drink
If you ain't chipped in, so hold ya cup, nigga

[Chorus 2X]

[Iron Mic]
This that straight spaz out music, make you wanna something
But chill, try not to lose it
Sit back and adapt the Ruthless
We, coming for ya'll, get the tax, let's do it
And we, ready for ya'll got the gats to prove it
Shit, we do it how the gangstas do it
Clap 'em up, wrap 'em up, ductape you, stupid
To hell with the law, bang at they stupid
All we doing is keepin' it Ruthless
Going half on the drugs, bust down on the loosey
Banging shit up in the club, wild like you on acid
You a lame or you a thug, can't be on no half shit
Throw ya hands up, give it up for the Bastardz
So what, we don't care, if you bigger and badder
I got artillary to prove size don't matter
Signing off, Iron Mic, your new favorite rapper

[Chorus 2X]

[Iron Mic]
Yo, roll something if you keepin' it Ruthless
Sip something if you keepin' it Ruthless
Come on, spit something if you keepin' it Ruthless
We keepin' it Ruthless, we keepin' it Ruthless
Ladies shake something if you keepin' it Ruthless
Let me see something if you keepin' it Ruthless
Come on, spit something if you keepin' it Ruthless
We keepin' it Ruthless, we keepin' it Ruthless
Hustlas, flip something if you keepin' it Ruthless
Let me spend something if you keepin' it Ruthless
Hustlas, get something if you keepin' it Ruthless
We keepin' it Ruthless, we keepin' it Ruthless, nigga</pre>
