[Verse 1: Tik Tokk]
I grew up in the city of compton, Raised by my grandmother
Her, My sister, And my brother was a family
They wasn't understanding me
So like a lot of other brothers
I broke off from them, And found my family in colors
All I ever wanted was to be accepted not rejected
And being a young gangsta you got respected
The compton unified schools I started wreckin
Gettin kicked out fast as I checked in
Deep down in my heart I always knew that this wasn't me
But then again, I always wanted to be O.G.
I started robbin houses and I came up on some gats
And now I'm makin snaps off pullin off jacks
Satan had me locked in chains
He controlled my brain
I went to jail for posession of sales of yayo
I maxed my time, 3 years and 2 months
This is my true testimony, Not a front
When I got outta jail, I was still in a rage
Cause my body was free but my mind was in a cage
I remember grandma saying, God can help
But I said yeah right, I can do it myself
Then out of the blue I got a call on the phone
It was my homie Kapone, He had a lick, It's on
Standing on crenshaw wit a gat, I heard a voice shout
If you go back this time, You won't make it out
I met a lady named Lily who offered me Christ
He changed my heart, He broke the yoke loc, He changed my life
He never left me lonely, That was my testimony

[Chorus]
Testimony [Repeat 8x]

[Verse 2: Mr. Solo]
Fornication on my mine 7, 24, And some mo'
The devil used girls for bait to hook the Solo
I would invite em on a late dinner date
But it was lust on my mind not the food on the plate, But wait
I was like a hound, Sniffin around, Nose to the ground
Diggin in any girl I found, The devil had me bound
Ditchin school to feed my hungry flesh
I had an A in fornication, But a F on my test, Oh yes
Being in bondage is a horrible state
I can't escape, Havin sex so much that I'm losin weight
Moms started noticing Satan's yoke her heart was broke
So she invited me to church, Loc
I didn't give God my trust
My heart was filled wit lust
I had conviction, But it seemed like sex was an addiction
No church for me, Satan made me believe I could stop on my own
But I started drifting farther from the throne
Conviction was strong, God won't leave me alone
In my mind I hear a bell
If I die, I'm goin to hell, Well
To get away, I kicked it wit my crew but I knew
You can live in a crowd, But when he's judging, It's him and you
True, But wit a demon 187 on my back, What can I do?
Knowin I ain't right
Fornicatin all day and couldn't sleep at night
I was thinkin if I laid down my head
Moms'll wake me up and find me dead
Now I needed to be delivered
My body shivered and quivered
Cause livin in sin is like 5 to 10 in the pen
So I gave my life to Christ and got born again
And I know he won't fake, Shake, Or forsake a friend
And since he came into my life, He never left me lonely
And that was my testimony

Chorus 8x

[Verse 3: Chille Chill]
15 tryin to make it as a young hustler
I'm gettin mine, You get in my way, I'ma crush you busta
Me and a friend go half on the indo
Plus I'm gettin faded from that socco and gin yo
I'm a gang banger dope spot hanger
Chille Chill aka professional crack slanger
High as a kite thinkin everything is funny
Satan made me his dummy because my god was my money
[Yeah!] I started young livin, Life on the run son
Watchin my back wit my hand on that gun, gun
I had no piece runnin from the police
I got away for the mean while, But they had me on the gang file
Moms tryed her best to raise me right
But she didn't have the money to buy me khaki's, Gold, And Nike's
I'm on a mission, Clockin crazy tuition
Now the girls that were dissin are now the ones that I'm kissin
I wouldn't let God in
I chose the life of sin
Thinkin the friends that I had
Would stick through the good and the bad
But my birthday came and I got real drunk homie
I had a scrap and everybody jumped on me
I passed out, I don't know how I got home
But when I woke up, My high was gone
They stole everything from my money to that thing that beep
It makes me think it doesn't matter if you 6 feet deep
Jesus is lord and I'm convinced
Since he came into my life, I haven't drunk or sold dope since
Since he came into my life, I don't need no homies
And that was my testimony

Chorus till fade</pre>
