[Notorious B.I.G.]
Give me all the chicken heads from Pasadena to Medina
Bet Big get in between ya
Then pick the prognosis, doses
Blends and Bends like Twizzlers
Biggie's fitting to hurt
What's under that skirt?
(Slow down, son, you're killin us)
Who fillin 'em with octane?
Got 'em gassed up
'Bout to get blast up, sup
The last one, word to your mother
Brother, listen
I've seen it when he kissed 'em at the way
Made his body shake
The high tide it 8 50 I's smoke tank
Rap terror whore crow and terror, true
Fly by the rivers but this is conspicuous
Bad Boys slipped in ninety-five ridiculous
My rap's rhymes is like land mines
One step, ka-boom, black suits fill the room
To whom it may concern, Junior Mafia's the click
Act up, I'll have my honeys Total bust your...

[Total]
In the middle day now baby
I seem to think of only you, hey, oh yeah
Never thinking for a moment baby
That you've been thinking of me too, yeah, so

1 - 	I can't wait for the day
	That we can be together
	I can't let you walk away
	Can't you see you and me
	Were meant to be, oh baby
	And there's nothing left to say

2 - 	Can't you see what you do to me
	Our love was meant to be you were made for me, oh baby
	Can't you see what you do to me
	Our love was meant to be you were made for me

Every time I see you
I get this feeling, oh yeah
Telling me you are the one
Oh what a feeling, hey 

Repeat 1
Repeat 2

Take me away, so far away
Oh what you do to me, oh 
I wanna be alone together
Somewhere just you and me
Oh, oh

Repeat 1 until fade</pre>
