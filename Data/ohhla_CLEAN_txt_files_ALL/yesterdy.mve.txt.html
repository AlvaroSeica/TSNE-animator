Typed by: s.panasyuk@gmail.com

If I only knew then what I know now
shit would be so wild
mind of a man, soul of a child
no clouds could rain on me
no cuts or scrapes could leave blood stains on me
just imagine
how to side step the critics, understand my own limits
embrace the fire when I'm thrown in it
move with supreme confidence, through every team in the conference
reconcile dreams of common sense, dominant
no fears or insecurities, appreciate the impurities
build on that, never second guess it, never neglect the lesson
on every endeavor I bless the session, man
y'all dont know the half of it, trying to make my renditions accurate
hoping I can capture it for y'all, but now it's like today is my four walls

yesterday...
yesterday is gone...

{*cuts from Nas "One Mic"*}
no time for lookin back...
no time for lookin back...
no time for lookin back... it's done

yo, put my best foot forward, took two steps, toward the opposite
back and forth with things, saw a lotta shit
and I was under pressure, now I'm on top of it
so now I'm taking all I can get
my getaway hit the fork in the road and took the scenic route
'tween me and you, it brought the phoenix out of me
so partner you can hate me or love me, cause I might have been wrong
but my heart was pure, still, I cant say I dont have regrets
made mistakes I that wont soon forget, expectations I haven't met
and yet, I wouldn't trade this moment, pray for atonement
take me for what I am, a romantic but I'm not hopeless
writing my magnum opus, either you're high pysch, or lose focus
if you let it, some of y'all will never get it, holding on to...

yesterday...
yesterday is gone...

{*cuts from Nas "One Mic"*}
no time for lookin back...
no time for lookin back...
no time for lookin back... it's done

I guess that you could say we got a history together
so I can never forget her, not bitter
matter of fact sometimes I still hit it
seduced by the way that she call to come hither
but I found out the first time I did her
I'll never fall in love with her, she gone break your heart
make a mark, leave, and never come back
and its hard to say goodbye to her, nobody knows her like I knew her
see she one of a kind, just a free spirit, embodied by these lyrics
to some, she's not pretty, to me she's beautiful
cause she made me what I am and taught me to be strong
so even when she's gone, her memory lives on
and over time eventually we lost contact, despite that
I gotta admit, I'm still attached, but I can't take her back
cause who I'm talking about is...

yesterday...
yesterday is gone...

no time for lookin back...
no time for lookin back...
