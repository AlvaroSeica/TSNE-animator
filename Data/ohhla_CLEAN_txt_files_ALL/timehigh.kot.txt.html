Song:   Time to Get High
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

If you aint got no chronic
dont act like you smoke that good shit
KMK mob backup in yo ass like a piece of shit
Yall know what time it is!

[Chorus]
Its Time to get High
Its Time to get high
Need to break your weed out and let the smoke fly
Its time to get high
its time to get high
need to break your weed out and let the smoke fly
Light it up, here we go
Light it up,roll it up, one mo
Light it up, here we go
Kottonmouths in the buildin (smokin nothin but the chronic)

[D-Loc]
ya we got the bomb shit
we be hella smokin
blowin dank
kmk we aint bullshittin
pack your pipe is your life fill it up with the chronic
so we can blow this bitch up 
never flaunt it
if you aint got no crip nugs
that light green fluffy shit that makes a sucka buzz
watch the smoke rise
when I step into the room
no surprise
I consume [?] you could look at my eyes cuz buzz smoke that shit like a thug does 24/7
people think I sell bud slang sacks 
cuz I smoke like the dealer does
fuck that
yall need to step pack and peel back
and quit the rifraft
its like a bitch slap
let me tell you sum sum
no one listens
whats up with that
blowin smoke like a dragon
mark the blunts we can get it crackin
D-Loc whats happenin

[Chorus]

[Johnny Richter]
I got five flavors infront of me like lifesavers
got a different taste
each time I take a hit
im weed-famous plus im famous with my promotional plots so if ur old enough and got to doe to smoke it why not
shit I just took a hit and imma hit it again then imma pass it to my friend then imma hit it again
ya buddy
the bud got me feelin kinda nutty,in a half an hour later now im feelin kinda hungry
point blank
we need to open up a dank bank
cuz weeds worth more than gold in the streets of LA
so if you got a fat sack then youse a fat cat but if you only got a gram then ur hardly the man
I got big [?] filled up with nothing but chronic and bottles of grey goose for my vodka and tonic
(johnny ritchter your the man!) yea thats what they be screamin
sometimes my lifes is so good I gotta be dreamin

[Chorus]</pre>
