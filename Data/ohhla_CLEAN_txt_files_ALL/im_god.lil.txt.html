Typed by: AZ Lyrics

You know I always wanted to be the best
You know I always wanted to be God
This is real talk
It's Lil' B, yeah

[Lil B]
My new name is BasedGod, ice cream paintjob
Only come out in the dim lights, vampire
Shouts out to A.E. for riding in that 6-0
Roof out, stick slow, think fast, talk slow
Dude tried to play me, leave him with his bitch broke
Sorry for the cuss words, fuck that, curse mode
Bruh did thangs, shoulda been in the Hearse fo'
Now I'm spittin' rap shit, gave me suttin' to live fo'
Hit him with the P-9, bet it'll make his ribs show
Rap game is too fake, real niggaz lay low
Word around town that you living with a halo
Bet I got killers puttin' cash on Halo
No X-Box, shouts out to Toon, baby
Free Toon, baby, free Rocky, bitch

Free Rocky, free Rocky, bitch
Free Toon, baby
Feel me, yeah

Bruh think I'm gay kuz I'm grinding in my tiny pants
Bet I'm the only goon nigga in these tiny pants
Sending off shots, kick-back make ya wrist jam
Fully-loaded thing on my arm like a wristband
You don't wanna Space Jam, better off to vacate
No, it's no template, the textures, 6 kids, reckless
Hands around your neck like a necklace
Leave you screwed and chopped, have him thinkin' he in Texas, nigga

Yeah, you know what I mean
The mind is so complex when you're Based
32 Levels
Welcome to my world, like I said I been ready
And it feels good to be here now
Finally realized, who's the rawest rapper
(Yes) Lil' B

Just kuz you're a rich rapper don't really mean shit
I'll come to ya crib and clear that whole bitch out
And then blow the switch out, my mouth put the stick out
I can't be high and robbin' pussies with my dick out
I guess I'm a showoff, take my raincoat off
I'm so wet that the pussy get mad at me
Switch cars, new colors, call it raspberry
Got my own website with the dot com
Take it out the bag, open stove like Top Ramen
I don't sell coke, my niggaz look out for me
They ain't wanna let me fall off the (balcony)
That's like losing Mike Vick on the Falcon team
We a faculty, but I'm the team leader
I pass you guys, I'm in the two-seater
And what's wrong with you, this is Hip-Hop
This that '09 shit, I call it Based World

Based World (Yes)
That's what I call it, Based World (yeah)
You know what I mean
So just to tell you, it's a wrap to anybody that thought they had it
Ya need to think again
Throw ya hands up, it's Lil' B for lil' boys
I need all the Based energy I can
(Uh-huh)

Yeah is this what you really want, ya got me in the flesh now
No, I'm not stressed out, I'm God, I'm the best out
Rap transperant, my see-through glasses
Incoherent, and no I'm not starin'
I just see through you
And from your heartbeat you is soft in the middle
I'm real on the outside, solid in the inside, bitch, it's the Westside
Chopper in the trunk, leave you soaked like a wet slide
It's a part-time, rap game is my shit
I'm so sick, I'm feeling so nauseous
Somebody tell the earth I'm the best now
Somebody tell the ocean I'm the best out
Somebody tell the trees, I'm here now
Somebody tell the world I'm Based now
See me in outerspace, I'm outta reach today
Celebrate for me, I'm Based for life</pre>
