[Shawn Wigs]
Oh provoke, wind breeze, blow them trees
We bought two half ounces of kush for five beans
We pillage on the tour and the bus for six weeks
Scramble for sheets, smoked out of bible papers
It's the diabolical Theodore, you get the vapors
We stuntmen, sky dive from thirteen five
Bunch of rap heads, and still rhyme just to vibe
Different strokes, blow darts for different folks
Mash your black book out just like hex and hoax
You only spit, Ramos lives on in Beat Street 2
Just like Biggie lives on, through everything I do
Heart of a lion, the soul of Marvin Gaye
And it's a shame that all the real talent passes away
I'm here to stay, here to say, I got verbal degrees
And these are just 45 darts to put you at ease
I make songs, I'm an Ironman, Ghostface student
Anything else, to say this time, wouldn't be prudent</pre>
