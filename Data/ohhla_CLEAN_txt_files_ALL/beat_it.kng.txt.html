[Intro]
Kingston! (Breezy)
... Let 'em know!

[Chorus One: Chris Brown] + {Sean Kingston}
He ain't fly enough (he ain't fly) he don't even drive, no (he don't drive)
{That's why you're calling my phone, and won't leave me alone}
He ain't even fly enough (he ain't fly) you ain't gotta lie, no (please don't lie)
{That's why you're calling my phone} And you're wantin' me to get, get, get it

[Chorus Two: Chris Brown]
Beat, beat, beat it, beat, beat, beat it
You wanting me to beat, beat, beat it
Beat, beat, beat it, beat, beat, beat it
Not a problem, baby
Beat, beat, beat it, beat, beat, beat it
You wanting me to beat, beat...
Beat, beat, beat it, beat, beat, beat it
Beat, beat...

[Sean Kingston] + (Chris Brown)
I've been out here looking for a girl like you
So already settled down and loyal to your dude
(You got your eyes on me, and girl, he got his eyes on you)
(My eyes are on this money and it's nothing he can do)

[Chorus One] + [Chorus Two]

[Chris Brown] + (Sean Kingston)
You've been out here looking for a guy like me
And I ain't never settled down, just loyal to my team
(You got your eyes on me, girl, and I got my eyes on green)
(Your nigga he so bummy, need to a boost your self-esteem)

[Chorus One] + [Chorus Two]

[Wiz Khalifa]
Hahahahaha... Uhh
You say you want a fly nigga
Roll something and get high, nigga
I'm spending all the mose 
and if he ain't coming close it's time that you tell him bye
I'll take you up in the sky - we be floating
Get you wet - like the ocean
I-I-I'mma speed up on it
And if your pussy was a book I would read up on it
Girl, I'm just trying to get you back to my crib
Seen all them Instagram pictures you post so I already know what it is
Talk to me now

[Chorus One] + [Chorus Two]</pre>
