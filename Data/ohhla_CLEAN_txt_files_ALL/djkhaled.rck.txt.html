[DJ Khaled]
Trilla
I hope y'all enjoyin y'allselves
This is the DJ Khaled, the Don Dada
a/k/a the Big Dawg Pitbull, Terror Squadian
a/k/a We the Best, a/k/a Dade County 305
The movement~! We are here forever
Rick Ross (Rick Ross)
We survive through every storm
Any weather, any roadblock
Any fuck nigga
We here forever! (Forever!)
And we ain't never gon' stop
Rick Ross is the definition of the projects
Ricky Ross is the definition of the ghetto
Rick Ross is the definition of the slums
Rick Ross is the streets
You see Rick Ross, is like the poor people President
He represents the struggle
He's the level of the hustle
I am DJ Khaled
And I'ma stand beside Rick Ross for the rest of my life
Through the good times (through the good times)
Through the bad times (through the bad times)
SEE WE WILL NEVER BE STOPPED! (STOPPED!)
NEVER! (NEVER!) Cause We the motherfuckin Best
Aiyyo E-Class man, hold this man
My machine broke, from countin too much cash
Believe that! {*laughing*}</pre>
