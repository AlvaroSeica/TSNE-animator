Song:   Long Way Down
Typed by: jjd269@psu.edu

[Chorus - Sarah McLachlan]
And it's a long way down
It's a long way down
It's such a long way down to the place where we started from

[Prevail]
Yo, I'm still trying to figure out this Venus and Mars thing
But every time I see you all I hear is a harp string
We chilled last night I had to record this
Listen to portishead making love in the forest
Where not stuck in this orbit it's gonna work out for us
So gorgeous like the voice of the woman gracing the chorus
A newborn in its pure form gentle and precious
We connect on more than just mental don't let this shit stress us
I'm okay if you're okay, I know it sounds clich√©
But we built this whole relationship from sand and clay
Now we're so strong we've got a concrete bond
And it completes so solid I had to write this song

[Chorus]

[Madchild]
We met when we was young two hearts that beat as one
I knew it from the start not till death do us part
Nothing compares to you (keep blazin')
I'm a fine young cannibal and you drive me crazy
I know your looks attracts guys but that don't faze me
Soul mate, make me feel like they got nothing on me
Just to taste your lips plus your voice is calming
I know its hard babe cause I'm always on tour
But my love is fucking pure and that's for sure
Been around the world feel like I've covered whole earth's surface
Stressed out to the point of asking if it's worth it
Sometimes it trips me out kid cause you're so perfect
I gotta keep working, striving and building
So we can get a house, have kids and grand children
Till then I'll make sure you don't regret
That you gave me another chance girl I won't forget

It's a long way down (4x)

[Madchild talking over]
Listen to me man, make sure you love what you do
Cause it's gonna take a time for anyone to get to the ultimate goal
And as long as you love what your doing
Doesn't matter how long it takes and when it finally does happen
Try to remember how hard you worked to get there
And appreciate that shit
Keep climbing, BattleAxe...

[Madchild]
I'm shark where you swim sharp as a dart in your skin
We've been given a title that's not hard to defend
Not just my partners my friends see this from start till the end
With words that alter the wind cause we assault with a pen
And hit with the song no problems here we getting along
Take turns from learning from our mistakes admit when we wrong
And everybody knows how to fight to shows that are tight
A cobra that strikes, nobody's sober tonight

[Prevail]
Take a walk on the wild side give me beats and I'll never die
I'll hold your mind like a hypnotist
Swing the watch into overdrive
There's no rabbit or wand my habits are ripping a song
The magic comes from the act of people waving their arms
I'm as sane as I was given and receiving the love
Living and breathing this stuff with *Rob the Viking* on drums
Battleaxe warriors; Madchild Prevail
This is music for y'all bars notes and scales

[Chorus]</pre>
