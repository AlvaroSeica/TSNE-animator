[Drama]
Ya'll act like ya heard me
Instead of bustin my chopper man 
I kiss down on dirt [say what] goin be in my heart
cause A-T-L where i'm from
And everywhere be my stompin ground with 3-4-5 ya heard[I heard]
We trane as we kill'em, and no low limit were wit'em 
I thought ya taught like ya succas,I can tell when you're weak
Thats why I lead to tough succas low haters low punk now friends
Hatin on drama goin get you coward
And that means

[Chorus - repeat 2X]
Ooooooo I got my jeans and my boots
Ooooooo I'm tight wit my troops
Ooooooo My left, right, my left, Ooo lord I'm tight to def
TIGHT TO DEF!!  

[Drama]
See I'ma walk like a soldier, stay cheifin doja
I left right, come look here boy, I done told him where I'm from
It ain't no luck, thats the killaz, thats the fiends
From down south, don't charge us with them means
We don't bring it don't slang it
If it don't walk it don't talk it
Either go leave the house and bring your pistal and amor[what]
With D-R-A-M-A goin do you like rambo
A ten top about fate give me this shit
foward march

[Chorus]

[Drama]
Line em' up shoot em' down [uh huh] like Adolf Hitler [say what]
He talking the talk nigga walk the walk
I don't get down wit no succas, I roll with killaz and high rolls
[I guarantee] smoke rolls like dojahs
Cant  get buck I done told ya[can't get me scared]
I'm tight like the 5s---8 and you wearing the twelve
I'ma bust ya'll bustaz style the cut to brains[ok]
Burn in the fire punk like a really hot clothes hanger
Blast'em to my last clip 
My last on I holla out

[Chorus]

[Drama]
Tight to def
For the 2000 ya'll
We done tooked over</pre>
