(Intro - Luu Breeze)
It's BRRRR!
Something new
Breeze
Mega
ChamPagne Gang

(Verse 1 - Luu Breeze)
See I'm the one, state your name, one that they call Breeze
City looking for guidance and leaders and they call me
Enter parties, in some Ed Hardy's and they all freeze
Passing haters, looking for shorties, where could they all be?
Here with some goons up on my side but you know how that go-go-go-go-go
Packs I supply but you know we got mo'
Feeling lucky then you should try but you know we got fo-fo-fo-fo's
Packed in the ride, in a chevy on vogues
Sitting clean, scoping scenes, feel it's a dream
Shorties walk is so mean, got a playa thinking between
Time's they need lie, rappers think they getting at Breeze
The supreme fines a career, shattered by Breeze
Homie, I will end them all!

(Chorus - Luu Breeze)
Got what you want, ducketts all in my jeans
Shorty back up and make it work, make your U-Haul lean
See I'm headed to the bar, what do you all need?
I got the key's to the city baby girl (Cause I can do that there!)
Back up and body something, you know what I mean
Shorty, back up and body something, you know what I mean
Shorty, back up and body something, you know what I mean
Shorty, back up and body something, you know what I mean
Back up and body something
BREAK EM OFF!

(Verse 2 - Luu Breeze)
Break Em Off something proper, whether you feel that it's working
For money that you was given out, you tryna rememberce it
Man did you wrong and you out and feelin' like flirting
Pictures on your internet, now you see me in person
And she happy, things looking better for the man
Some niggas tryna derail him but they need a better plan
Like celly's a better reception, I'm getting from the fans
Cause Breeze's a better man, I can lend you a hand
Dog you talking to the mill ticket, appeal vivid
And boy I thought you was a real nigga, surreal living
I get harrassed in the malls, kick it, this real pimpin'
Those who wasn't listening before, Mega they will listen
And get a feel, of the real, prince of this s**t
Others they just my double, in this movie, real as it gets
Luuis is just a menace in this mega city I'm in
Tryna take credit for something i've built and something i've of been
Homie, I'll end them all!

(Chorus - Luu Breeze)
Got what you want, ducketts all in my jeans
Shorty back up and make it work, make your U-Haul lean
See I'm headed to the bar, what do you all need?
I got the key's to the city baby girl (Cause I can do that there!)
Back up and body something, you know what I mean
Shorty, back up and body something, you know what I mean
Shorty, back up and body something, you know what I mean
Shorty, back up and body something, you know what I mean
Back up and body something
BREAK EM OFF!

(Bridge x 2 - Luu Breeze)
Break em off man, everybody getting bodied
Break em off man, everybody getting bodied
Break em off shorty, everybody getting bodied
Break em off and break em off (BREAK EM OFF!)

(Chorus x 2 - Luu Breeze)
Got what you want, ducketts all in my jeans
Shorty back up and make it work, make your U-Haul lean
See I'm headed to the bar, what do you all need?
I got the key's to the city baby girl (Cause I can do that there!)
Back up and body something, you know what I mean
Shorty, back up and body something, you know what I mean
Shorty, back up and body something, you know what I mean
Shorty, back up and body something, you know what I mean
Back up and body something
BREAK EM OFF!</pre>
