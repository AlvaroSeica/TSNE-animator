You got somethin on yo' mind nigga? Say dat then

[Crooked I]
Well let me say it without worryin about if my label OK it
When Weapon Waist whylin out man, give him room
Used to have skeletons in my closet but now they sit in my living room
Octomom, I picture puttin more niggaz in a hole than that bitch's womb
The street sweeper's the wicked witch's broom
A silver spoon, I never had it
I grew up mad at Anne Frank cause the bitch lived in a better attic
(Say dat then) I seen my share of static
They say that it made me charismatic
Born leader who was born Libra in a foreign two-seater
with a porn diva, blowin reefer and pourin liters
of vodka, cause the Fed's freezin a nigga bread
I'm drinkin thinkin they gon' seize me even when I'm dead
(Fuck 'em!) Killers in my backyard
In the dark with choppers while I'm sleepin in my bed
Dreamin about Slaughterhouse droppin an album that's a chart topper
while I got these demons schemin on my head
Even though I'm the realest, see it wasn't enough violence in "Menace II Society"
to show you how Cali killers be chillin in society
And the police, they hate me
Long Beach PD, probably wanna kill Eminem for signin me (real talk!)
Cause I was supposed to be a statistic
A ghost to me is realistic
My dead homie said "Say dat then"

[Joell Ortiz]
Guess this where I'm supposed to vent, huh?
Under scrutiny all my opportunity went, huh?
Reality is I had more personality bent, huh? Nonsense
But honestly my conscience, is dealin with a constant
conflict with the bullshit I've been doin
that I feel so bad about the second after it's accomplished
A compass, I need one of those cause I'm wanderin in darkness
But I see straight and it feels great bein clean around this
Bein clean around this (say dat then)
Bein clean around this garbage, two-steppin through this garden
full of frozen cold snakes when you a lion, warm-hearted
Bank account comma but still get your undergarments from Target
with a penthouse apartment, kinda nigga still ready to piss in that elevator
and shake the doorman's hand before you go joggin
Yaowa; I'm just a hood nigga, fuck it
But I'm a good nigga fuckin after that cat on my tongue
But never the cat got my tongue my nigga (say dat then)
So I could knock your dome off your neck
Get your whole right eye socket broke with a left
You could go ape-shit, fake prick
And take flicks with eight cliques, you still never posin a threat
If you gon' say somethin say it then

[Interlude: 2Pac sample]
Hahahaha, my biiiig mouth
I got a big mouth, I can't help it
I talk from my heart
I'm real, youknow'msayin?
Whatever comes, comes

[Royce Da 5'9"]
You got somethin on yo' mind nigga?
I made a livin off of rhymin 'bout just how I feel at the moment
Right at this particular moment, I'm in that zone
where I'm wonderin how far I really could get with just my diploma
Reflectin on how rap is a blessin
Feelin that same feelin before I fucked my first bad bitch
that I got right after undressin, feelin like "Am I about to get this?"
In yo' head you hear it
That voice of confidence that comes down on you from the heavens like "Yeah, you 'bout to get it"
Just hope that you don't stick your dick in a dud
Cause that bitch can end up your wife or your mistress
or a chick the same type as your mistress 
or a chick that's just gon' draw your name with a stick in the mud
Rather intended or unintended
It all comes with the territory, no pun intended
I fell out with all of my friends like "Is it me or is it them?"
Angry like, "Shit everybody can't be wrong, but a lot of these niggaz just can't be right!"
Therefore, I'll say it's their fault, say dat then, I fuckin plan to
Too many hoes out here niggaz done ran through
I'd rather roll through the valley and lay low
I done fell out of love and back in love again 
then out of love and back with my spouse more than Halle and J-Lo
If she left me my inner self would shatter
I could leave her cause I'm a selfish addict
The problem is I just don't want nobody else to have her
If we split up consider my health a hazard or else livin in wealth and lavish
And as far as THESE NIGGAZ, who wanna kill me you'll never get a chance
You a criminal chill with your subliminal Twitter rants
You bigger than that, you just ain't bigger than me
You are literally killin me figuratively
I'm busy thinkin about who hot and how they bit off me
If any one of you niggaz jump on me nobody gon' have to tell you that you should probably get off me
And that's off rip bruh, your contract killers can sign off wit'cha
That little beef y'all talkin is small things to a giant
Like Goliath been drinkin that anaconda malt liquor
Slaughterhouse, we the nicest four fellas (House Gang!)
And if that day should come that we should ever part ways
It'll just be an excuse for us to, reunite at Coachella

[Joe Budden]
I heard them words and they stung, my ear drum
Was told that cancer finally made it through his lungs
Some of y'all are blessed enough that y'all have no idea
what the fuck I'm talkin 'bout cause y'all got no experience
So in case you hear this verse and thinkin there's the slightest chance that he'll survive
His cancer's on level four (level four) and there's not a five
So my mother lose her mother, now my dad is losin his
All from miles apart, wildest part is that's not the wildest part
What's outlandish is I too would wanna vanish
Alcoholic uncle robbin 'em blind and takin advantage
My aunt's supposed to be holdin him down, but she's sure to gain (why!)
Behind his back just took out another insurance claim
... (Say dat then) Well indeed I will
They makin all these alterations to his will
He can't even play his poker games in peace, y'all gotta chill
Like I can't decide if he's dyin or y'all rather have him killed
I know a nigga last breath shouldn't be this way, and if there was I would panic too
Tell me what's a man to do
Playin devil's advocate, none of it's understandable
I walk in the house and feel that energy as if it's tangible
Well e'ry rapper got a Cuban on
lookin like marks, I'm just busy tryin to get my Mark Cuban on
My Lyor, Rick Rubin on, my Nas, 'Pac, Big, Jay, Em, infusion on
Could outrap any movement goin
Gun on that couch shit, wrong one to be runnin your mouth with
Bars, no VH1, it's Mouse shit
If a nigga don't spit crack, go back and stock up
No harms, sometimes you gotta stir it 'til it rock up
Been broken, been rich, been high, sober
Fucked almost e'ry model twice over like I was livin my life over
These niggaz ain't gotta like me but after a decade in they all respect me
Shit, they don't even directly indirect me
It's cool though, back to business, stackin these riches
means caskets in ditches with my Trues on livin sacrilegious
It's Joe, lookin like money all the pretty hoes can't help but look
Life hand me lemons, better be what Jordan Belfort took
Slaughter la familia, Glocks out over here
The +Schoolboy+'s with Kendrick, we dropouts over here
Uhh, no offense cause them my niggaz, and that list is short
You get the gist, I'm sure
