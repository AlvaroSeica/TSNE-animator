Aiyyo fresh from out the lab on this funky collab'
Profile and my addiction is a pen and a pad
Truly gifted beats sifted with the greatest of ease
Could it be? Shoulda guessed it, that's right the SP's
NY to SD connect well let's see
I'd like to thank my man DL for lettin me
Drop this little ditty and rock for all the kiddies
Respect the knowledge taught on blocks in every city
So with the jigga jigga I'ma push it along
DL, Sound Providers, you can never go wrong
And just to let you know what type of flavor we're on
Here's a strict interpretation of a real rap song
So when his tape drop you should go out and cop
Cause DL is guaranteed to make the real heads bop
Only ten and some change, that's affordable range
Aiyyo it's time to wrap it up, peace to my man James
