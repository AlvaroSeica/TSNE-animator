Song:   Dance Move
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Bust a dance move
Pop a bottle, pop a tag and bust a dance move
Bust a dance move, like a damn fool

[Chorus: French Montana]
Do the money dance, hundred racks a watch
Hundred grand, tell em' bring a mop
Pop a bottle, pop a tag and bust a dance move
Bust a dance move, bust a dance move
Shorty pop pill, pop pussy
Bust a dance move, bust a dance move, bust a dance move

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
Shorty want this money tell that bitch to bust a dance move
Bust a dance move, bust a dance move
The NFL must think I'm a damn fool
Every time I touch down, I bust a dance move
They use to have a movement, now they can't move
Used to be on that grizzly like Van Couv
Bout to make these Rams move, L.A to ST.LOU
Say you got them toys, that santa story just ain't true
Say you get this money, I'm no snitch I can't tell
Call me MC Hammer, name a bitch that I ain't nail
Can't touch this, you know that you can't touch this
All black jewelry, now that shit do it justice
Stand by while I bust this, you look like you does this
Come and rub my hair girl, teach me how to Douglas

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Wale]
Look, look
Yeah lot of strong
All up in they V.I
Smokin' on what seems to be loud
I'm lookin' like Mr. Miya
Lot of shones
Nigga can't you tell that we high?
And before I leave, I'll peace out
Let me see that camel, 3 times
Slight work though, nightwork though, my girl don't
Y'all girl go where my girl go and you there alone
2 nights, made a hundred grand
Pair of Nikes like one to ten
It was hustle time and y'all walked it out
When the money right, y'all runnin' man
Pullin up the whole [?]
This is no from no cataract
If you could understand what this watch cost
You would understand why I try and adapt
Me and him cannot shake hands, why trap when I'm a free man?
You so a loss, you a robot, who done told y'all niggaz to break dance?

[Chorus]</pre>
