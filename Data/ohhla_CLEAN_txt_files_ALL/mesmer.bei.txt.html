Song:   Mesmerized
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Club night
Drunk as what
Homies tryna sober up
All my niggas in this bitch
Pretty girls all in this shit
Shorty go lights low
Major on the radio
She say this her favorite song

I say baby order what you want
The night is still so young baby
And when she starts to dance
She leaves me in a trance

I told her baby I'm so
Mesmerized by you
So don't worry about nothing
I'll take care of you
Cause when that thing go low
I don't know what to do
So don't worry about nothing
I'll take good care of you
Got me mesmerized by you

Stop whoa!
Where she go?
Where she go?
There she go
Love the way you workin yo
Uh you so professional
Say you from the city
But you come out here to have some fun
Shorty's so siddity
But she pretty

Baby order what you want
The night is still so young baby
Every time you start to dance
You leave me in a trance

I told her baby I'm so
Mesmerized by you
So don't worry about nothing
I'll take care of you
Cause when that thing go low
I don't know what to do
So don't worry about nothing
I'll take good care of you
Got me mesmerized by you

I pulled up in my vico
She looked out the peep-hole
Opened up
Said hurry up
She gets on me when she cold
She had dinner ready
She ate hers already
Pinot Gridgio and spaghetti
I looked up next thing you know

Her dress flew over her head
Her bra slid off of her shoulders
She looked right at me and said
Uh, oh baby come over
Her panties slid down her leg
I couldn't keep my composure
So after it was all over
I just broke down and I told her

I'm so
Mesmerized by you
So don't worry about nothing
I'll take care of you
Cause when that thing go low
I don't know what to do
So don't worry bout nothing
I'll take good care of you
Got me mesmerized by you

Got to be mesmerized by you
Got to be mesmerized by you</pre>
