[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Welcome to planet Earth
Where people are divided
Some who try to fight it got violence and it hurts
Damaged turf, put men at work so people could manage personal demons and them it's worth
Cause they give roadblocks and you're told not to show at the vote box and go for the broslops
Wich in shows get the folks hot, what do you suppose locked the shows rock is gotta be their old and cold pops
Racism is passed down and Gate gives them mad frowns
But how they live and laugh now should be they bis and last sound from class clowns
People should be free to be together
Should be free to be whatever you can see that we can better
When we give respect is good in any language
People are the strangers, but we don't wanna see any anguish
When I see we free to be something, anything we see
All we gotta do is
B.E.L.I.E.V.E

[Chorus}
They smell the fires burning
They hear us in the streets
And now the world in crumbling
They want us on our knees
So, that's why (That's why)
We all (We all)
Must stand (Stand tall)
For what?
For what we all believe

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Yeah,
Lost so many soldiers overseas
Over cheese
I was on my knees, and cowaiting by rain steady praying for the world to freeze
Little kid's gone, never did wrong
Look at him as a lens but he is strong
We should take notes
Why you wanna hate folks?
And hurt each other using color as the scapegoat
We all struggle to bubble we gotta huddle up
Different people together like in a shuttle bus
Trouble is double, double motto?
Your freedom is yours
Your free to explore
They speak in evil, you're free to ignore
Through these hells I freely see because I
B.E.L.I.E.V.E

[Chorus]</pre>
