Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Why must you challenge me?
It's spite, I was born a ninja warrior
and I have to prove myself to all ninjas that I'm the best around
Then you've got to defeat me first
Sure

Ke-yah I'm a ninja master kickin' kickin'
Ninjitsu hya-tah ke-yah kickin' kickin'
Sure to be a shogun master kickin' kickin'
Ninjitsu hya-tah ke-yah kickin' kickin'

Black gi, black mask, nunchucks
Ninja, round kick all you dumb fucks
Built like a dumpster, balance on chopsticks
Backflips, dive rolls, dope dropkicks
Kick fast, cross face, whiplash
Knocked out cold you seen a quick flash
Legs busy as fuck like mr. Crabs feet
Ninja suits me roundhouse feet

Ke-yah I'm a ninja master kickin' kickin'
Ninjitsu hya-tah ke-yah kickin' kickin'
Sure to be a shogun master kickin' kickin'
Ninjitsu hya-tah ke-yah kickin' kickin'

No master, self taught outlaw
5 right feet to the jaw ain't a south paw
Quick kick turn your head like its a thick chick
Knock an eyeball out like u slick Rick
Take the right side of my foot and place it
Where your teeth was let u taste it
Rapidly before your back hits three
You get punched slapped smacked and kicked with a quick

Ke-yah I'm a ninja master kickin' kickin'
Ninjitsu hya-tah ke-yah kickin' kickin'
Sure to be a shogun master kickin' kickin'
Ninjitsu hya-tah ke-yah kickin' kickin'

Claw to the neck chop to the skull
Go for the rest I'm dropping them all
Paw to a jaw fall to a crawl
Shadow up on the wall was all that he saw
Wire, neck, pull, slice, kill em
Finish my bowl of rice
Assassination you know the price
Shitow like dolemite
Attack in the dark like poltergeist
Pressing your luck like roll the dice
And come back bloody when I hold the mic
Ninjas creeping a colder night
Kickin' kickin' lunatic in
Skin a chicken kick your dick in
Inflicted pain wicked game Ninjitsu shit it's

Ke-yah I'm a ninja master kickin' kickin'
Ninjitsu hya-tah ke-yah kickin' kickin'
Sure to be a shogun master kickin' kickin'
Ninjitsu hya-tah ke-yah kickin' kickin'
Inflicted</pre>
