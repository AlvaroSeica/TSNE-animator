(chorus)
young and restless tryin to make it in this dirty game
I'm on my knee's lord please see me through this pain
come into a thugs life and make a change
forgive me for chasin all the material thangs
the last year of my life just ain't been the same
I seen 'em die over money,drugs and fame
suicide dawgs runnin' through my jealous brain
young and restless tryin to make it in this dirty game

(verse 1: WHITE DAWG)
all this pain got a nigga on his knees
young and restless tryin to make it in this game of greed
game runners, paper chasers on the grind
you better get yo's cause I'm damn sure gone get mine
white dawg and that nigga dozia slimm
in the steady three caddi pimpin' versacci and portin brim
catchin all the bitches eyes as we ride by
praise me like god as we hit the shit side to side
all them whoadies live service in em gone
broken hearted so much feelin when I'm all alone
nothin to lose so I gotta let my nuts hang
runnin game steady grindin for this fuckin change
train up bitch get yo mind right
no room fo mistakes so you better get shit tight
all em nuts so I stand on my platform
on my knees lord please get me through the storm
alot of things I done did I ain't proud of
except for ways til we both fell outta love
born an alcoholic so tryin to break the cycle
just another sad song in a movie title
see I'm down to play some cords on the keyboard
cut off the lights and cry til I can't cry no more
I make them funk til this shit give me chill bumps
and think about how daddy use to come home drunk

(chorus 2x)

(verse 2: WHITE DAWG)
and remember we done fly
to the clouds in the sky
I just wanna get high before a nigga die
so go the rot and playa when gangsta's march and ride
I'm loose so hard but I'm really hurtin inside
been tryin to come to terms with my crazy messed up life
sleepin all day and stayin in the studio all night
I heard a whisper sayin thangs gone be alright
but I'm hurtin like a shank stuck off in my side
browards playa's and we down the magazine
my hands are to dirty for some soap to make 'em clean
ever since I was a little kid I had this dream
playin' ball and bein a star on the team
but it all got twisted up some how
8 years later on the stage layin it down
I'm 24 thinkin ball til I fall
now I make these bitches crawl when I walk through the mall
my ex's mother said i'd be nothin but a bum
I just kept on prayin hopin things would come
now that I made it and got me a lil some
I guess I'm high all this pain made a nigga numb
I'm searchin for the truth didn't see it in front of me
now they want some of me but I ain't givin 'em none of me
tryin to make it through this maze I'm bein tested
just a confession of the young and restless

(chorus 2x)</pre>
