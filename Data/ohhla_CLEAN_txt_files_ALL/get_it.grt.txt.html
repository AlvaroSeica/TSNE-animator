Typed by: AZ Lyrics

If you can feel it feel it
then get with it with it
we stay witty with it
so you can get it get it

we stay above average stay killin these tracks yo
i stay off in the country but stay city with that so
stay keeping yall guessin stay in higher demand
stay true to who im repping steady movin ahead
i stay original stay spritual never move outa line
if you could read up in between i stays clear with mine
since 89 i stayed straight no more livin off state
the only bars i stay locked in now are 16 or 8
you wanna stay in the kitchen
when grits is hot they bubble
stay poppin out the top stay ready to tussle
who wanna muscle flex context in combat with bone
ill have you cryin to your mamma
talking bout leave me alone
mixed views misconstrued
by the way that we present it
send it out through verbal lessons
herbal essence when we spit it
if you hit you gone feel it and get addicted ill admit it
the first times for free but the rest cost life get it

bass how low can you go
evangelic shatter false hope like a useless relic
im an animal covered with hair insides mechanical
guardin my heart like im botanical
im snatchin satans mandible
i damned him at best with random access
forever banished when he left his lies vanished
standing in the midst of chaos
hours of praying and fasting began to pay off
at times like these cant take a day off
what i compete with i get street with
my strange language bone crusing anguish
pain cant be quenched or vanquished
my anger rise up its ludicrous the way i throw dem bows
and swell his eyes up aint that cute
the honey pot that money got his hand in
its funny how he think he got it on lock he just a stand in
reprimandin rebuking til you understandin
juke with reckless abandon you can get it
get it get it get it

we can get wild child
keep looking at me now
we can get wild child
you see exactly how</pre>
