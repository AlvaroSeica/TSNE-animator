[DMX]
Yea, DMX
Straight out of ATL
Ya' Mean
We got Yung Wun, choppin that thing baby
Once Again, Swiss Beats, Full Surface

[Yung Wun]
Bounce, Bounce
When I'm drunk in the club, I might just start sum shit
Block party in the hood, I might just start sum shit
Underground Downtown, I might just start sum shit
Gimme the keys to the city, I'ma lock this bitch
They aint gon take me alive and you can bet dat
Hit 'em where the chest at
Hit 'em where the neck at
Show me where the rest at
They in the same building livin' like a mess pack
four miles from where the deck at
Bet Dat, Shawty
You and me gonna ride over to the other side
Its time these motherfuckers die
First make a prank call and get the kids out the house
I aint tryin to kill no kids, but I'ma turn they lights out

[chorus 2x : DMX]
AAAAAAHHHH, Tear it Up, Let me see you Tear It Up
All across the board we gone Tear It Up
We gon bounce it till the beat cut off
We gon rock thiis motherfucker till the wheels fall off

[David Banner]
Tennessee motherfucker, hock a dick in your mouth
East Lake till I die, smokin dro in the drought
I make a bitch give me money then I'm kickin her out
I spit game to your wife, then we robbin your house
Y'all niggaz love that way that we grippin the grain
If you got it and I want it, I aint callin your name
Just lay it down, Fuck Boy, like I'm ballin G
You get your chest in your lap bitch for fuckin with me

[chorus 2x]

[ LIl' Flip]
You might catch me at the Rose Bowl game
In a 4-door range
With a Rose gold chain
Wrapped around my neck
Or I might be flashin' in a white jeep wagon
With my arm out the window, grippin' a Tech
Dawg, get it right, I got Houston on lock
I kit it right, I switch the lights every time I buy a drop
Homey, You got Swiss on the beat
I gotta come with the heat
It's David Banner, Yung Wun, and F-L-I-P</pre>
