Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Yeah I dropped a tape
Surprised myself man
I don't know how I feel about it
Other than fucking amazing
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

Let me give you lil' bye by the southside nigga
I like my bitches on their back with their mouth wide nigga
Explosion
Explosion

I must do what I feel
I can't afford to get caught in a bullshit that life brings
A young woman always told me it's your choice how you choose to react

So I hit the the club and I turn up
Fresh as fuck your ho might know me
I am a real nigga for certain
I don't have a bunch of dimes but I keep some strong sixes like Turner
know some shot niggas that'll burn ya

Yeah yeah
And this is the second part of this
I gotta let ya'll niggas know man like for real you know what I am saying
It goes a little something like, OK
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

I'm from the A-town for the most part
Kicking shit up your party
Ain't bothering nobody
You couldn't kick shit no better
Your main bitch?
She?s a choke artist like Webber
It wasn't hard for her to notice me
Like I'm James Harden like OKC
As she hit them high notes like [?]
I'mma shoot the guts
Ain't knowing' me
Knowing me
Knowing me
This is a good lil' journey you finna to take right here
It's gonna take you somewhere you never been
Hopefully
You know what I'm saying</pre>
