Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Nobody move nobody get hurt
I be waiting at the light
I be waiting at the light I got 8 seconds or less
To decide if I'mma walk or ride
I slide up and put the barrel to her neck and scoot bitch
Im driveing and were in pursuit of your loot bitch
Im dirty wicked for the bank roles and bad hoes
See me lurkin in the shadows the had hoes
Got some nickleplated heavy and loaded
Leave a hole in your face but the back of your dome exploded
Nobody move nobody gets cut the fuck up
And chopped down we poppin off rounds
Fuck you we aint pullin over in a stolen ovea
With a nock nock whos there its some bullets comin over
Mack One-Oh, Shaggy 2 Dope and Violent J with hearts full of wickedtry
Bitch fuck what you sayin I'm pluggin one in your cranium
Put two in my pockets like the rhythm of my world do shit cant stop it

Nobody move nobody get hurt
Nobody move nobody get hurt
Nobody move nobody get hurt
Nobody move nobody get hurt
Nobody move nobody get hurt
Nobody move nobody get hurt
Nobody move nobody get hurt
Nobody move nobody get hurt

It aint shit for me to keep it gangster on minds
The pile of coke got me froze but I can use another line
This is a jack move a noted I'ma take what I find
And this revolver close range will sure to blow your mind
I got some homies from the deep claimin ICP
But I'm the chicken hawk how they gonna chicken hunt without me
Peep game did I show you how to put it down proper
First chicken in the door and wave the forlock bigpapa
Take the old place for the stash spot
And tell em one false move they get there ass shot
And if some dude move you gotta spit rounds and hit it
You drench the place with Faygo let them know the clowns did it
Nobody tell cause we shut a snitch up if its a brod
Get some juggalettes to roll the bitch up
So make no mistakes this is the two one one
Jay Shaggs and Mack 10 will make your crew run run

Nobody move nobody get hurt
Nobody move nobody get hurt
Nobody move nobody get hurt
Nobody move nobody get hurt
Nobody move nobody get hurt
Nobody move nobody get hurt
Nobody move nobody get hurt
Nobody move nobody get hurt

Blast motherfucker blast blast blast blast
Slugs in your bitch ass my aim sucks
So I bust point blank robbery in progress first national bank
Im fuckin shoot first shoot second shoot third
Then I drop whoevers left spreadin through secruitys vests
Nobody move in the club when we walk in
They all just freeze terrified of my crew just hawking us
But you all can just relax line up like some bitches drop your money in the sack
Partys over hoes get they jelly blown out like titties
And I blast these stupid hero idiots movin on me thinkin they will save the day
With joni seals there graves away so put your motherfuckin face in the floor
And if you move but dont then its your head and my bullets with a all out war

Nobody move nobody get hurt
Nobody move nobody get hurt
Nobody move nobody get hurt
Nobody move nobody get hurt
Nobody move nobody get hurt
Nobody move nobody get hurt
Nobody move nobody get hurt
Nobody move nobody get hurt
Nobody move nobody get hurt</pre>
