Aye Yayo, all I know is Yayo
every time she hit the block that hoe she be on go mode
and if you try to rob me swear to god that be a no no
sauced up and I'm loko and you niggas know so (x3)

[Snootie Wild]
Aye yayo, yea I just said yayo
taste just like that candy cane but whiter than that pure snow
and why you trying to play me and you know you selling wappo
when you with the boss, then I got to say so
aye oh no, he hit licks like oh no
counting all this mula paper you can call it mucho
'cause I be rockin all this paper moving with like macho
I be eatin nachos, cheese, guapo, aye vato!
holla at amigo and he gone get them bricks and wrap them tighter than burritos
I let him know I need it for the low and need it pronto
he gon' ship them off (pshh), torpedo

Aye Yayo, all I know is Yayo
every time she hit the block, that hoe she be on go mode
and if you try to rob me swear to god that be a no no
sauced up and I'm loko and you niggas know so (x2)

[Yo Gotti]
Aye Yayo, all I know is yayo
trapping doing good, I'm serving junkies out the peephole
laws, oh no, serve you that's a no no
but since you niggas actors I might shoot like some bureau
I got killers on my payroll, no sleep, i'm on doors
on my paul wall shit, I'm tippin with that 44
mister thousand eight grams
mister prices they too high for me
I love all my young niggas, I know they'll die for me
bang! provide for me
cocaine in my county, kush truck that loud weed
I don't smoke blow pound for me
woo! Yayo
car white like mayo
seats white like whip cream
rims look like marshmallows

Aye Yayo, all I know is Yayo
every time she hit the block, that hoe she be on go mode
and if you try to rob me swear to god that be a no no
sauced up and I'm loko and you niggas know so (x2)</pre>
