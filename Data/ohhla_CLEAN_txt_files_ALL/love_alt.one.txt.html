Typed by: Wammy Giveaway

Chorus: Cisco Adler
Sometimes, my mind slowly drifts away
Wonderin' if you wanna come play
I just want you to know
Your love's like magic
Like magic

(Verse 1)
[Uno]     HEY, HEY, I'm gettin' faded with Lindsay
          Hollywood lights, and I'm causin' a frenzy
          Somebody called Paris, "Let's meet at the Hilton"
          The superstar suite, now there's something to tweet
          I'm everything you need girl, let me fill your world with
[Fingazz] "Ma-ma-ma, ma-ma, magic..." --&gt; Cisco Adler
[Uno]     Shwayze called Cisco, then Cisco called Kate
          The California girl that Mr. Travis can't shake
          Got the ladies goin' Gaga, baby, I'm a fly guy
          Steady low-key, watch 'em all fly by
          But I'm cooler than you like Mike Posner, boys
          Send me kisses through the phone like Soulja Boy
          Da, da-da
          Walking on water
          Not like you, they just a son or a daughter
          I'm a take the plane, yeah, change the whole game up
          It's still the spot like the 'Ye did Taylor

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 2)
[Uno]     First class flight, but my pockets are empty
          I'm shooting out to Vegas, 'bout to kick it with 50
          And Puff is there too, but he's acting like a (BITCH!)
          And Shyne said it best, "Yo, I think that boy SNITCH!"
          New York, New York, but it's Cali that brings that
[Fingazz] "Ma-ma-ma, ma-ma, magic..."
[Uno]     And my, oh my, ladies love it how we like
          You can get whatever you like (YEAH, RIGHT!)
          And kids out in Jersey fits pumpin', they rock
          And you know you got a smush if they buy you a watch
          Abracadabra, now you a celebrity
          A little sex tape, turn into reality
          T.V., radio, video, YouTube
          Hey Rihanna
          I could be that rude
          And when I'm in the Hills, Heidi always turned the other cheek
          I cris Angel and make her whole mind freak

Repeat Chorus

Hook: Mr. Lil' One
Go ahead, drift away, come play with me
But don't believe everything you see
Cause her love is like magic
It's like magic
It's like magic
Da, da-da
Walking on water
This is going out to all my broke ass ballers
It's like magic
It's like magic
I'm so addicted to the love, I gotta have it

Repeat Chorus

[Fingazz]
"Slowly drifts away" --&gt; Cisco Adler
"Fi, fi, fi, Fingazz on the track"
"Slowly drifts away"

[Mr. Lil' One]
It's so east (So east...)</pre>
