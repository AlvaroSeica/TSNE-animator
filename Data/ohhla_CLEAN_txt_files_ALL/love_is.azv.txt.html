[Intro: AZ]
See; this is what I mean
When we come together like this
Incredible things take place
See we connect thoughts to collect shorts
And only the strong survive
I love my black people
We are the future

**Blaaaaack is the color of my true skin
Its space is so soft and wonderous care**

[AZ]
Chop the pie up, four ways get light up
Infiltrate never violate get tight up
It's all a chest game choose sides the best remains
True lies wives guys bumped invest the game
Broke shit pop your broke you let your man get lock
I live this hip-hop, stop the bank let the crys pop
Beep the next shit, push a big Benz fuck a Lexus
The streets is too hectic so I stacked then made my exit
One dough to get focus my thoughts for me to go legit
Voracious shit, cop a huge cats who on a ocean cliff
Imagine that a few years back I was baggin cracks, magnet gats
Playin street corners commitin sabotage, twistin up
Nothin but love for niggaz sittin up
Hold your own try to comin home without gettin touched
Two for one laws made foul how they do the young
Was new to come try to tell shorty he should of threw the gun

[Half-A-Mil]
Knowledge the green Wally's
All I see my mind hold math like caller ID
Chose the path that chose me
I'ma tell you like Jody told me
Green lust hate and envy sweet dust from shanty
Keeps us from simply...unify organizin
We all are fallin when we think we all risin
We pop crys on the horizonin
Topless chicks with thick thighs'in
I rather be civilizin, enterprisin, improvisin
Temperature risin, Lo Huimin gave me the guidance
Told me to leave those 85's alone
Blend with the wise men, that bought 80 G stones
Twin Mercedes on home, fucka you spend 10 G alone on chrome
When I die take my chromosomes and clone clones
200 and 8 bones, microchip kids we most dominate
You know what time it is thats why I exist
Jump out a limo lands fire the place
Why scientist supplyin this violet then why this?
I'm survivin this quiet tribalness
Finalist year 2000 flyin the whips
9 cent, mind bent, 1999 rhyme align'ment

[Nature]
We went from arraignments to entertainment
24/7 after the same shit playin the strip livin dangerous
Bottle after bottle soon became obitual
The patterns we follow others found 'em difficult
I guess it's obvious as to what my hobby is
The ruler of all evil pollute same niggaz body kids gettin caught up
The same gang that left more stuck
I reminisce on VS touchin my fourth cut
Me my only problem is I'm all fucked
Knowin in my heart I can't sleep, til I bust off nuts
We religion for all my niggaz that beat the system
And those who bidden sittin since Coneto vision
Ya'll need to listen, it's journalistic
Ya'll hear the whispers the niggaz in the Firm is twisted
Spit that fly shit that earn the bitches
Whip the chrome 6 up to FDR, its bless we are
See I never let them stress me God, forever stress-free
While twistin logs for that nestle
Who are you to question me?
It's just my destiny to kick back kill time and live successfully

[Outro: AZ]
Firm, how y'all want it huh, ha ha
Talk to me, we give it to y'all either way
We workin with y'all, this is for you!
Love is love, 9-8, Firm shit</pre>
