[KRS-One]
It's irrefutable my facts are usable
They might be new to you be they suitable to the street entrepeneurial
Mentally immovable when I move it's your beautiful brutal funeral
And your face on a bodega mural
I can cruel all or kill all which every you prefer y'all
I throw up lyrics like cats choking on fur balls
Herbal melodies &amp; vocal melodies be changing up my identities
From Kris to Public Enemy back to Kris to Scarface
To Bill Bellamy to Mase moving to the 21st century
From this one to that one that one to this one
We won
Yo test your mic son</pre>
