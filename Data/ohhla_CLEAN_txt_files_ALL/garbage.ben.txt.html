Cranky Franky, Fat Head Fred, Little Ed
Saliva Susie said was an incredible red
Spit dripping down her chin, I wanted to hit it
I grabbed her tit, she was too slow, she didn't get it
But in a minute the mini-bus would be in school
I liked Dirty Dianne, she used to pee and drool
Being cool is always easy on the bus with Benny-Roach
They told me I was special cuz I rode the stubby coach
I was never learning, The bus was driven by a German
She used to yell Quit Banging Your Head Helmet Herman
On the contuary, these kids are all corney-scary
I hated Rotten Rita and Horney Harry
He used to grind the bus seats, my walking-into-the-bus-beef
I would always cuss loudly on class retreats
Trashy freaks with big glasses and snotty noses
It turned me on to watch Crippled Carrie's body poses
I was always the kid that would trick the others
And shot spitballs at the Limpy Gimpy Brothers
Sometimes I'd get mad and say I think I'm leaving
Because they'd sit me next to Monkey Mike and Stinking Steven
Crauchy Scotty and Fruity Scooty would touch in the back
Man, I'd kick them on the ground, grab a crutch and attack
When we got to school I couldn't wait for the ride home
Cuz I'd flirt the whole way with Betty The Blonde Gnome

The Wheels On The Bus Go Round And Round
Round And Round.... Round And Round
The Wheels On The Bus Go Round And Round
All Day Long
The Wheels On The Bus Go Round And Round
Round And Round.... Round And Round
The Wheels On The Bus Go Round And Round
All Day Long

I Remember Tyranosauras Rex eating Pridget
And Pokey Paco was a Mexican Midget
Flemmy Frank was coughing and could never beat germs
I used to force him to drink spit and eat worms
Henry The Hunchback would never punch back
I'd beat him in the hump and then I'd take his lunch-pack
Everyone on the bus was a vegtable head
And the kid that got all the girls was Testicle Ted
Man, most of them were born with this initial vegetation
They told me I was gifted and in Special Education
Matilda The Gorilla used to give a big scare
She even gnawed off the wheel to her own wheelchair
I liked being special, it was cool being different
Pukey Pete would throw up his breakfast and sniff it
The shortbus was packed full of moody vermins
I just chilled and drank Kool-Aid out of a Goonie's Thermos
They all dressed bad from Wreaking Ralph to Dirt Tom
While I laid back cool with an Out shirt on
I got my flirt on with Meaty Meghan and Melon-Head Marge
Something was wrong because I was always in charge
After four years they realized I wasn't retarded
Man, how could this mistake happen, how was it started
My file said he makes noises and twitches without stopping
It turns out I was just beat-boxing, popping and locking

The Wheels On The Bus Go Round And Round
Round And Round.... Round And Round
The Wheels On The Bus Go Round And Round
All Day Long
The Wheels On The Bus Go Round And Round
Round And Round.... Round And Round
The Wheels On The Bus Go Round And Round
All Day Long</pre>
