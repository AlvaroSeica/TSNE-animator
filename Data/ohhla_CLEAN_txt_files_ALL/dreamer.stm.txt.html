[Chorus]
Some might say I'm a dreamer
Cause I'm living for the son
I pray someday you will join us
so we could live as one

[Verse 1]
Now just picture this for a minute lets take a ride
And visualize seeing the whole world thru my eyes
I'm just a normal person individual just like you
I came to turn you upside down that's what I might do
You see a world full of hate full of hopelessness
Corrupt minds end times full of loneliness
But I see a world full of nothing but love
Healing for the sick a way out for the thugs
No more doing drugs there's a worldwide peace
And everybody gets along from west to the east
Living in a world just the way God intended
But somewhere down the line it got twisted and bended
One day we'll return to a nation that's God lead
And eventually it'll be just like John Lennon said
You may say that I'm a dreamer but I'm not the only one
And I hope someday you'll join us and the world will live as one

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
It's not asking too much at all
Just be there for your brother when he's about to fall
It's gonna take a while before you walk just crawl
And just believe with God that we can do it all
You gotta catch the vision and the seed I'm sowing
Cause at the rate were going our fate only God is knowing
You need to put away the pride you're showing start some growing
And begin to enter a realm that's truly mind blowing
I didn't come to force on you what I believe
I'm just a kid from South Central with much to achieve
I wish that I could help the world but I can't
But if we join forces just maybe we can
So love on your neighbor squash all the beef
Cause life ain't worth living if you don't have peace
You may say that I'm a dreamer but I'm not the only one
And I hope someday you'll join us and the world will live as one</pre>
