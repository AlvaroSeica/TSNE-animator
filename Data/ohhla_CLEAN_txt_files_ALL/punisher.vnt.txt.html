[Vents]
Yo, yo, yeah
I got the napalm jelly for your platoon
Smell the kerosene fumes and the molotovs, ready since the womb
Smoke getting heavy in the room
No joke like second-hand fits found buried in the dunes
Put me in your arm, feel the calm when it hits ya
Find me in the street making noise, Hare Krishna
You get the gist of, feeling I'm stuck
Free to choose, but make the right choice or you're fucked
Too much is never enough
Pharmaceuticals moving like Veniamin peddling stuff
A rich man with a permanent frown
Got a four-wheel drive and the old prick's never left town
Had a heavy let-down when the company called
No work but Centrelink cushioned the fall
I heard a wise man talking bout saving the poor
Give a little then take some more, now get ready for the

[Chorus: 2X]
Big up, big up, what's the deal? How you feeling?
Busting up the jam, bad man, it's the villain
I'm Vents number one, competition is none
You start up the beef, then consider this done

[Vents]
I gotta hit 'em with magnum force, sort of like a bad divorce
Slamming doors and gambling, your dad in the courts
Just lending a hand in the war for your mind and your thoughts
Financed by the fines in the courts
I'm performing divine intercourse with the marijuana, Belladonna
Can't we all just get along?
I'm witness to market collapse
Armed with the facts and the mask and the gas
This is arts and crafts for the mass of the disgruntled
and the displaced, Happy Meal shit tastes cancerous
Dr. Death got the potion
Praying for a quick death all by my lonesome
Drowning in the ocean, big city life
We driven by the money and a big titty wife
So take what you like but when the game stops
put the king and the pawns back in the same box, now

[Chorus: 2X]

[Vents]
Putting holes in your dealer with a box cutter, castrate the cocksucker
Take the car keys and ride, you got robbed brother
Make a bonehead suffer
Give me that Southern Cross back while the molotovs crack
Holocaust rap, horrible thoughts
I pause to make sense of never being born
Living alone, dying alone
Trying to phone somebody, anybody, please tell me you home
It's the punisher, right in front of ya, don't hear none of ya
Like 'em kind of young, he put a nut in her, uh
By the time it's a boy, twelve dollars a week
So that little bastard could eat
Now, bullets be the cure for beef
I wonder what's the cause, same shit that powered our fleet, what?
Ain't nothing sweet
I'ma stay pissed off and talk shit till my heart don't beat, yo

[Chorus: 2X]</pre>
