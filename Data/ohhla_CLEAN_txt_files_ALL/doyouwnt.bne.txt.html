[Chorus]
Do you want me? Do you want me?
I thought I heard you call (call)
If you need me, if you need me
I'll come runnin and I won't stall (runnin and I won't stall)
Do you want me? Do you want me?
I thought I heard you call (call)
If you need me, if you need me
I'll come runnin and I won't stall, not at all
 
[Layzie Bone]
I still remember the first day I met you, it was me and you I envisioned
Not really thinkin that I can have you but it feel good while I was wishin
You was switchin walkin down the hall, I'm twitchin shakin in my drawers
Had to push up on you, give you my number and hope you call
I could tell, you was diggin me cause all the time you would smile pretty
Kickin my conversation, you was interested gigglin wit me
Kickin it with me, in a few minutes was like eternity
My eyes met yo' eyes, it was somethin inside burnin in me
 
[Chorus]
 
[Layzie Bone]
Now you was the only one that I had eyes fo'
all of them other girls they despise you
When them chickens they wanted to fight you
I will be standin there right beside you
Ready to get 'em up, and you will get buck when it came to me
There you stood, 5-foot-3, cute as can be and ready to rumble baby
I thought it was special the way we held each other down
'Member me holdin you in my arms? Baby couldn't nobody break our bond
It was just me, and you, it was me-you against the world you see
The things, we did to be together was just so risky, wasn't it?
Had me holdin hands in public, niggaz they thought I was out of my hook-up
Every time I looked up, you done cooked us up somethin scrumptious
And not only that, when my future was damn near didn't look bright
Someway somehow, you would find a way to bring the light
Wrong or right, peace or fight though you was wit it
Had my back like one of my henchmen and I'm never ever gon' forget it
Let a thug hit it, come cut the grass or paint the walls
Fix the car or give a massage, and all you gotta do is call
I does it all
 
[Chorus]
 
[Layzie Bone]
You let me run the streets with my thuuuuugs
When I get home to youuuuu
I'ma put it on youuuuu
IIII'ma put it on you
If you want it pick up the telephone, hit me on the 2-way sweetie
Tell me somethin freaky, dial the number if you need me
Believe me, I'm yours for life, after death we'll love in heaven
Good times and the bad times I'ma be there for you 24/7
 
[Chorus] Â– repeat 2X</pre>
