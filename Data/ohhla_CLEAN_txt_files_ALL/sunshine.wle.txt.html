[Chorus 2X]
Spotlight on my fans
Sunshine, I can't tell a lie
What makes you say that they just wanna hear now?
What makes you say that they just wanna hear now?

Yea, that new black show
Uh
Uh
Yea, bounce, bounce
This show's over at the moment, right
Look...

I was in the business and you was chasing the pussy
Now I got the dollars, I'm tryna get my position
Couple bad decisions, I got some character issues
I blow another slippin like Stevie tryin permission
They sayin the weather, the more could try and get me
Sure I love my friends, carry paraphernalia
Fall in love with things, you should go and marry civilian
Picture a young rich former taking me serious
I thought I had my shot and even in my prime
Singles in the chart make a broad lose top
These days, ain't gotta do nothing to pop these days
Instagram is runnin they thoughts these days
These 62 joints, got me duggin on em
I'll go get my clap and now I'm stuntin on em
You better know that you overdue for some better inners
That's whoever developed second-guessing they blammers, word

[Chorus 2X]
Spotlight on my fans
Sunshine, I can't tell a lie
What makes you say that they just wanna hear now?
What makes you say that they just wanna hear now?

Yea yea let me tell you about the girl
Aha, every day, to not forget let me tell you bout the...
Back of my shit
Let me tell you bout the... let me tell you bout the...

I don't like to boast but man you touchin the floor
Fair pussy, put everything in this cone
My only feelin mere, she scared of being alone
She settle for this bitch, she starin she be a trophy
I'mma probably marry somebody ready familiar
VH1 team all I'm thinkin about is this
Can do without the pennies, another bro record up in the business
Had that locked since I lost my scholarship
Bout me getting it to my old coach I'm ballin
Rose glow with 40
Shall we record it mane? Grab the 40
To me the thought of money would change it and got worse
But it's a lot better than the screaming who got worse
I'm holding it from back to packin it on that 30
I never sold crack when crack rappin was workin
With that fat just backpackin and murkin
Get in that, probably he know why you're Mr. Perfect

[Chorus 2X]
Spotlight on my fans
Sunshine, I can't tell a lie
What makes you say that they just wanna hear now?
What makes you say that they just wanna hear now?

Let me tell you about the girl
Let me tell you about the girl
Let me tell you about the girl

This dedicated to my nephew Tony
Rest in peace bro
Love
Shine on us Kuzo
We ain't pposed to never
We ain't pposed to never
We ain't pposed to never
We ain't pposed to never
We ain't pposed to never have
We ain't pposed to never
We ain't pposed to never
We ain't pposed to never</pre>
