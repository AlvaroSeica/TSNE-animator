Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Listen to me baby
I think it's best you walk away
Before you do anymore damage
Acabaste con mi corazon

What was the hardest part of bein alone?
I'm guessing it's nothing compared to having you here at home
You don't even wanna be here I don't even know why you lie
It's like your hiding from yourself something your feelin inside
Hell I was always afraid that one day you would walk away
Now that am faced with what your giving me
Nothing I can say
There's nothing more that I can do to try to keep you here
So many nights crying myself to sleep and you weren't here
And all the alcohol I drank just to wash it away
Erase the pain I'm past the point of insane
I've lost my mind thinkin about what could I do to get it right
I think is best you walk away fuck it if I cry

I think it's best you walk away, leave and not turn around
Your one of the things I can't live without
And Even if am dying inside mi corazon no puede mas
Ya te a llorado un putal
Ahora sin ti ya quiere estar

I think it's best you walk away, leave and not turn around
Your one of the things I can't live without
And Even if am dying inside mi corazon no puede mas
Ya te a llorado un putal
Ahora sin ti ya quiere estar

Baby let me break it down
Since I can't seem to make you happy
I can't and I won't do anything to make you love me
Don't stay because you see me cry
I cry because I know I tried and nothing happened
So I don't regret you walkin
And I don't regret the times you made me laugh and held me close
Promise to think of you everytime I up the dose
Steady, keeps me sedated
With the thing you put me through
So I'm a dwell on the past Until the day there's something new
I never thought you'd walk away
Never thought you brake my heart
The only way that you could brake.
I gave you everything I had and you knew.
I really really loved you to, but you never said it

I think it's best you walk away, leave and not turn around
Your one of the things I can't live without
And Even if am dying inside mi corazon no puede mas
Ya te a llorado un putal
Ahora sin ti ya quiere estar

I think it's best you walk away, leave and not turn around
Your one of the things I can't live without
And Even if am dying inside mi corazon no puede mas
Ya te a llorado un putal
Ahora sin ti ya quiere estar

I wish that I could say it didn't hurt to let you go
That I could behind a smile so you wouldn't know
Den everything would be okay, get myself back up
Pick up pieces of mi vida and just not give a fuck
But when it all comes down it's hard to walk away
I know nothings gunna change if you decide to stay
I'll be okay I guess it just takes time to forget you
Go back to life that I once had before I met you
It won't be easy but my heart will understand
And with time it won't remember all the good times that we had
You and I, me and you I'll find love once again
And this time I'll know for sure it will never ever end

I think it's best you walk away, leave and not turn around
Your one of the things I can't live without
And Even if am dying inside mi corazon no puede mas
Ya te a llorado un putal
Ahora sin ti ya quiere estar

I think it's best you walk away, leave and not turn around
Your one of the things I can't live without
And Even if am dying inside mi corazon no puede mas
Ya te a llorado un putal
Ahora sin ti ya quiere estar</pre>
