[Intro] [Bishop talking]
Yeah! Chevy Jones. Danjahandz. Listen closely you wack ass rappers
I made this just for y'all. Wack ass producers and singers
BITCH ASS niggas in general. Church

[Chorus]
So sad, to have had
Your career's over now
Till time, dry your eyes
Take a bow and say goodbye

[Verse One] [Bishop]
Mad man, it's the rap Mein Kampf
But to fuckin' start a whole new holocaust
4th Reich, my soldiers on the blocks
Self employed I ain't got no boss
Dre my O.G. so don't get it cross
Only answer to God or Christ on the cross
This is no facade, all me in your box
Real till I'm R.I.P. in a box
Death is an illusion
Life a mirage
So fuck authority, y'all not in charge
Military minded, call me sarge
'Bout to kill rap then I'm a criminal at large
It's trash day, y'all niggas gar-bage
I'm Shining like Jack in the lodge
Or Jay Nancy, I'm doin' my job
Since global warming is heatin' up for rappers it's a prob

[Chorus]
So sad, to have had
Your career's over now
Till time, dry your eyes
Take a bow and say goodbye

[Verse Two]
I done warned y'all hardheaded fuckers
In one ear then straight out the other
Catch me while I'm sleepin', that's Deep Cover
187 with your pillow get smothered
I'm sick and I'm not gon' recover
So pull the plug, I'm gone motherfucker
You rap niggas, y'all so stupid
I'm not just a man
Bishop's a movement
Don't believe me nigga?
Go on and google it
Been through Hell, got the burn mark to prove it
Couple of times like Constantine
Young soldier nigga since Ovaltine
I'm Murdock nigga, rep the A to the Team
Pop out the coffin with the M-16
I'm the clock on your dresser 'bout to wake you from your dream
Music to murder by, this is that theme

[Chorus]
So sad, to have had
Your career's over now
Till time, dry your eyes
Take a bow and say goodbye

[Verse Three]
You niggas don't know what's happenin'
I'm preachin', y'all niggas rappin'
I'm teachin', y'all barely passin'
Most rap albums out, hate 'em with a passion
You ain't the man nigga, you Jesse Jackson
Standin' next to the man when bullets was blastin'
Bishop Luther, born to be king
Rappers bow down, muah, kiss my ring
God's middle finger, I reign supreme
Fuck y'all niggas, can't reach my height
Thoughts so deep, fish need flashlights
Homie I'm today, you niggas last night
This ya execution I'm readin' your last rights
Fuck good manners, I'm through being polite
Niggas cock hammers, I'm the foreman on site
Carson's about to blow and I'm the dynomite

[Chorus]
So sad, to have had
Your career's over now
Till time, dry your eyes
Take a bow and say goodbye</pre>
