[Intro: Ice-T]
Terror!!

[Verse One: Ice-T]
It's on, no time, no hope, no chance
Run with your family, they're coming to kill
They hate us, they want us all dead
They say: that the white man is evil
It's all Allah's will, I heard it on TV!
The news man he scared me
He said their here with us, we're all gonna die
He's spreading the terror
But they're all called terrorists
The news sells the fear even if it's a lie!

[Chorus: Ice-T]
Run for your life! Dirty bomb! No one is safe!
Anthrax attack! - No one will survive!
Run for your life! Dirty bomb! No one is safe!
Anthrax attack! - No one will survive!
Terror! Terror! Terror! Terror!

[Verse Two: Ice-T]
Get ready, gas masks, join up, fight back
Kill them before they can get here to kill us
Suicide bombers, they're coming
They said it, I read it!
They don't care they'll die for their God
I know it's the truth
The news man on TV said: they're not even Christians, they're not like us
There were turbans and beards, and speak with an accent
If you see them beware, they might have a bomb!

[Chorus: Ice-T]
Run for your life! Dirty bomb! No one is safe!
Anthrax attack! - No one will survive!
Run for your life! Dirty bomb! No one is safe!
Anthrax attack! - No one will survive!
Terror! Terror! Terror! Terror!

[Hook: Ice-T]
I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die!
Terror! Terror! Terror! Terror!

[Break: Ice-T as a TV announcer]
Good evening! 
Welcome to Channel Four news ~ Attention!! 
Beware of all Middle Eastern people, they could possibly be terrorists!
Be very afraid of them

[Hook: Ice-T]
I wanna live forever, I don't wanna die
I wanna live forever, I don't wanna die

[Outro: Ice-T]
Run for your life! Dirty bomb! No one is safe!
Anthrax attack! No one will survive!
Run for your life! Dirty bomb! No one is safe!
Anthrax attack! No one will survive!</pre>
