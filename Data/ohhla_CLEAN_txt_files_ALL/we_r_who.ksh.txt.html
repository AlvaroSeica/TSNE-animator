[Ke$ha]
Hot, and, dangerous
If you're one of us then roll with us
Cause we make the hipsters fall in love
When we've got our hot pants on and up
And yes, of, course we does
We runnin this town just like a club
And no, you don't wanna mess with us
Got Jesus on my neck-a-lace, ace, ace..
Got that glitter on my eyes
Stockings ripped all up the side
Looking sick and sexy-fied
So let's go-oh-oh - LET'S GO!

[Chorus]
Tonight we're goin hard, hard, ha-har ha-hard
Just like the world is ours, our, ou-our ou-ours
We're tearin it apart, part, par, pa-par pa-part
You know we're superstars - we are who we are!
We're dancin like we're dumb, dumb, du-dum du-dumb
Our bodies goin numb, numb, nu-num nu-numb
We'll be forever young, young, yu-youn yu-young
You know we're superstars - we are who we are!

[Ke$ha]
Dee-jay, turn it up
It's about damn time to live it up
I'm so sick of bein so serious
It's makin my brain delirious
I'm, just, talkin truth
I'm tellin you 'bout the {shit} we do
We're still in our clothes, sleepin in cars
Dressin it down, hittin on dudes (HARD!)
Got that glitter on my eyes
Stockings ripped all up the side
Looking sick and sexy-fied
So let's go-og-og - LET'S GO!

[Chorus]

[Ke$ha - repeat 4X]
Dee-jay, turn it up

[Chorus]
