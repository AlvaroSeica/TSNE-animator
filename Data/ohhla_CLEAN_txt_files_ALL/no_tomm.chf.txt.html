[Intro: Popa Chief]
This that shit we live and die for...
Fix it in the list..
Uh, uh, I gotta throw some more veggie burgers on the Bar-B
K-Blunt has stepped up in the party
Yo engineer...

[Chorus 2X: Popa Chief]
This that shit, we live and die for, love and lie for
Hurt and cry for, guzzle, get high, for
Represent like it ain't no tomorrow
Represent like it ain't no tomorrow

[Popa Chief]
Everybody spark a banger, blow smoke screens, all American first team
Pimp limp, I push the hooptie with a mack lean
New feet, dirty jeans, party all night with 30 beans
Eventually gone, snitches gotta come clean
How you gonna have ice, if you ain't got no CREAM
You playing with yourself in a field of dreams
I'm a scrub whose far from a slouch, no crystals on my
Green shit, in a see-through pouch
Make a mic scream out, rapid fire appear from a crouch
I got that hip hop, dying in a take-out
My ink is permenant, Garden of Eden resident
Hobbies include, guessing busty birds measurements
Allah rip the party like he OD'd on Viagra
Popa Chief got more flows than Niagara
Win or lose, Kamikaze the right team to choose
Opponents get battered and bruised

[Chorus 2X]

[Popa Chief]
Spit flames, never blink where you aim, my crew is untamed
Try to live for what we got? Catch an ego strain
Self explanatory, frame by frame
Top of the food chain, now watch Pops make it rain
Verbally insane, when all else fails, never bail
Tip the scales in my favor, Now N Later type of flavor
I hunt blood like it makes me, wiser
Fuck cutting a deal with the prosecutor
I'm innocent, crime and punishment, know who you running with
The crookedest niggas in the game, the government
Arrowheads dipped in poison, with your name on it
The kind of target.. BLAOW! Blow 'em to bits, can't help it
Touch shit, melt shit, just the way I planned it
Damn it, the whole world felt it
Leave no stone unturned, no MC unburnt
You can't get butter if the cream ain't churnt

[Chorus 2X]

[Popa Chief]
Rockin', reefer cologne, VIP on the megaphone
Screaming, 'all my fans go home!'
Big up, where you at, let's get stank like butt crack
And tell the G-O-B and posse to keep smoke that
I'm back, and it's the one you been waiting for
I go with Big Baby and Buddha Monk on tour
Splashing making belly flops, international pitstops
Wait til you get a load of me when my chocolate salty balls drop
The masses gather, when I bubbles like lather
Lacing you with actual facts like Dan Rather
The rich get richer, jailbirds pose for pictures
When you call me, muthafucka, don't forget the Mr.

[Chorus 2X]

[Outro: Popa Chief]
Represent, represent, represent, ya'll
Represent, represent, represent, ya'll
Represent, represent, represent, ya'll
This that shit, this that shit, (U.K.)
This that shit, this that shit, (Zu Ninjaz)
This that shit, this that shit...</pre>
