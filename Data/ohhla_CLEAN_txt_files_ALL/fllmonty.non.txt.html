Crack you like a twig
You're like a faggat rockin' the wig
I'm the adopted kid who knocks you stepchild
Your real mom's a pig
Thats how I classify these dumb crowds
A bunch of scumbags quick to pull a gat
But look at that, your gun jams you cunt rag
You come in handy when the pussy's bleeding
But you the pussy bleeding right now
But no you ain't dreaming
Just because we right just doesn't mean we ain't scheming
How the fuck you think we kill devils and slay demons?
You be the type to smoke with cats
That think they blunts a seaman
We hit your wife off and barely heard that slut screaming
PCP and marijuana had a dusty meeting last evening
Oh shit I think your mom's beeping
Word thats her number no doubt
Yo I'ma break out
First I get some chinese take out
And scope jake out
Park out on the corner of your mothers building waiting for me
But I broke out before the story
And those devils never saw me


To my kids sold in sheets
Rap freaks
All you tricks in heat
We'll crack your beef for being sweet
Don't even try to sleep I'm full length
You're a snip of tape
I been in state but you tradin' jakes
While your ass inflates
My dictates what a fag you are
Up and drag stag in zanzibar
Rocking tennis shots
I'm pro what comes sports
Like a benetaur
Fuck a figure 'fore
I lace it with a cleated shirt
Smoke a fucking pound and watch these cats go berserk
I terrorize whole cities - you 'bout to feel my work
Mexican cats in shades Heavy D ate my blades
Feather base pumps like Flava Flav
I shed scenes on dark days
??Friend of all angels?? on fatal car chase
Drive through the flatlands til I hit ralph
Caught the stench of the rotten projects
Bagger left and I'm out

Non-Phixion be the full monty
????????????????vinnie ponty??
??????????????????????
Fucking like Phil Bronski
I'm ill constantly
Kill with the velocity T3
Three years before the movie got out
And Ja Rule be with the gat out gotta give a shout out
To Goretex and Teikei and?????? Steering this
Just like a love boat
Or William S Borroughs' rough coat
Smell the gun smoke
You get thug broke
Like uncut coke
With no client to sell it to
Internal Revenue
There's many levels to the train of thought
We taking over airports
Get slain for sport
Probably share recourse like Puffy
Non-Phixion vampire slayers like Buffy</pre>
