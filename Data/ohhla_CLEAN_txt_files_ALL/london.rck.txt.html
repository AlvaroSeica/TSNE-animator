Typed by: AZ Lyrics

London, England, January
The weather, gray
The rain, thick
I wake up, depression all around me
Dark thoughts clouding my mind
And I open the drawer and I see two things
I see the warm told loafers
I see the crisp Kashmir socks
And I know that today is me to be a good day
A hundred dollars a sock
Two ankles, you do the math
Pour them on
Socks on the first, followed by the loafers
Then I know from that day, that week
that month, that year, that decade
That millennium
That we'll be rich forever
Rich forever!</pre>
