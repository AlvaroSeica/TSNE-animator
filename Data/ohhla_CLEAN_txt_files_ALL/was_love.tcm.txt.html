[Chorus]
It was love
What made Him bleed and cling to a tree
It was love
Unlike this world has ever seen before
It was love
What made Him bleed and cling to a tree
It was love
And get nailed to the form of a lower case "t"

To all my listeners you're on my "got to get with you list" 
Scripture gives the run down, come now you've got to picture this
The evolutionist would call this ridiculous
Story of a love a true love that got promiscuous
The true lover was a King they called Elohim
Dig it, He was exquisite, always existed
For designer clothes He sported shekinah robes
The kind that glows, baggy, you know the kind that flows 
He was awesome majestic, flawless, perfect with
All this you might ask what could be next
His outcry zoomed throughout the counsel of the Triune
Crank the volume, when God speaks it's a fly tune
"Let Us make man in Our likeness and Our image"
He sparked it, even before He started He was finished
And since it's a fact that every kid needs a nursery
Before He made man He made a universe a world to be
A play pen, you know a place to chill, one to play in
Fields to lay in, earth to rule, one to stay in
He took dust in His hands made a man
Breathed life into his veins, said, "Adam is your name"
It was all fun and games no pain and no strain
He named all the animals, they were pre-tamed
Man and his God, chillin' like jello with
Nothing to undermine the divine fellowship

[Chorus]

Curtain please, scene two, we see the surgery
Adam de-ribbed , now Eve lives, we see with certainty
God wanted the earth to be full so earth can see
God and glory go together like thermometers and mercury
Intertwined, Elohim was man's date
But it's a thin line between love and hate
And just like a person will be weary till rested
I guess love will always be theory till tested
So check it, God put this tree off limits
He can do that, the earth is the Lord's and all that's in it
He meant it, He told Adam the tree about this one tree
He said if you eat the fruit then you're saying you don't want me
In other words you're saying, "Bye", I wouldn't lie
Cause the day you eat from this tree you're surely gonna die
Why in God's name couldn't Adam maintain
No blame, if it was us we would have probably done the same thing
Satan tricked Eve, Eve gave to Adam
Sin had them, death grabbed them, and on went the pattern
The earth got cursed on the day they dissed Jehovah
He said, "I told ya, now our relationship is over!"

[Chorus]

It really gets to me, it really is a mystery
Why with foresight God even let us ruin history
But the love story gets deeper
Holiness make Him hide from sin but His love for men made Him a seeker
My heart is getting weaker, it's burnin' me bad
I earnestly ask why in eternity past
Did the Godhead agree that they would let man leave
Knowing the penalty---that they'd have to let man bleed
But this is just a case of the holiest
Questioning the infinite wisdom and the justice of the lowliest
God's omnipotent and sovereign "Yes I know He is"
And He's gracious and merciful "The Bible told me this"
Took a human frame, Jesus was His Human name
Doom to hang on a cross cause we're His lost love
Resurrected just to get with you if you get your cue
From Scripture you can see He clearly preplanned the switch-a-roo
He'd always planned to become a man, die as a substitute lamb
Start a new fam of humans who can
Take the Son's hand in reply to
His proposal, "Will you marry Me?" we say, "I do!" 

[Chorus]
Love made Him bleed and cling to a tree
It was love - unlike this word has ever seen before
It was love - that made Him bleed and cling to a tree
Nailed just for you and nailed just for me</pre>
