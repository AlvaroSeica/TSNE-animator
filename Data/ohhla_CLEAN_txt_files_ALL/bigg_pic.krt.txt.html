[Intro: sample from The Meter's "Stormy"]
I'll paint all the world for you baby
I'll paint all the world for you
(I'll paint all the world for you)
I'll paint all the world for you baby
(I'll paint all the world for yoooooou)

[Big K.R.I.T.]
Yeah, I wish you saw the bigger picture
I wish you saw the bigger picture

[Chorus: Big K.R.I.T.]
If I make it I'll come back to get you
It's clear as day but you don't see the vision
I wish you saw the bigger picture
What we got deserves some patience
Cause this ain't no finger paintin
I wish you saw the bigger picture
Beautiful and modern all the same
But what's a photo if it's out of frame?
I wish you saw the bigger picture
(I'll paint all the world for you)
I pray you see the bigger picture

[Big K.R.I.T.]
I call your phone, you don't pick up, you text me
Too late to come back, you say 
my art ain't even half the way it used to look
The colors that I chose to compose 
my last masterpiece wasn't worth the cover of a book
I listen as you rant on about Rembrandts and Van Goghs
That, I used to show you was so pure at heart
Now all the pictures that I draw lately 
perfect my need to be basic and all the shading tears your world apart
Pollock I promise, you say it's scribble and scratch
I know you don't mean it cause on your wall's where it's at
It's not my best I agree, but I did what I could
With these sticks and these stones to get us out of the woods
I find my rhythm and and my stroke 
then you fall in love with my art like you did befo'
On that note I let go, and tend to my canvas 
to paint a mural of us, I hope that you understand the bigger picture

[Chorus]
 
[Big K.R.I.T.]
Back to my roots, channel my youth
You love the color of yellow, but I'm workin with blue
Like what's the use of doin art if I ain't breakin the rules?
My graffiti wasn't Banksy but you thought it was cool
It used to be fun to watch me do what it do
But when the paint started dryin, I stopped runnin to you
and started walkin away, cause I could paint any day
One line from being complete, I'm sorry I made you wait 
to get a crown and some space, I thought you'd be a great painter
Cause you could see the good in me in all the angles
A radiant child we could've had
And those clowns in yo' past you paint, just make you laugh
All because... that self-portrait 
that I put on display, should've been of us
I left you out and I was wrong
I promise I'll start over if you come back home
- on the bigger picture

[Chorus]

[Bridge: sample] (K.R.I.T.)
I'll paint the sky blue (I'll paint the sky blue)
I'll paint the grass green (I'll paint the grass green)
I'll paint the roses red (I'll paint the roses red)
And everything in between (And everything in between)
I'll paint the sky blue (I'll paint the sky blue)
I'll paint the grass green (I'll paint the grass green)
I'll paint the roses red (I'll paint the roses red)
And everything else (And everything else)
in betweeeen (in between) {4X}
(I wish you saw the bigger picture)
