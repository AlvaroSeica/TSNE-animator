(Man)
Now with your loyal fan base and to the extent
that there dedicated to your music and your message
It has some people calling you a cult leader, how do you feel about that?
(Tech N9ne)
Cult Leader....eh hahaha
(Man)
Yea there comparing you, to you know like Jim Jones or David Koresh
(Tech N9ne)
You know thats real fucked up to um compare me to Jim Jones or uhh David Koresh.
You know what I mean because those where not people that where for the greater good
You know what I'm sayin, there tryin to say, that Im gonna feed my fans electric kool aid
They got me fucked up...
In this house there is no room for envy, this is why we wear our uniform!
Racist not welcome! Rapist not welcome! Hatred, dreaded in this house!
Ready to fight hatred with love? Join us!
 
(Chorus)
If you come with me then I can show youuuuu
Where we'll take you where you dare not go tooooo
Follow me and let my mind control youuuuu
Where rebuild this world that will destroy youuuuu
 
(Tech N9ne - Verse 1)
How many wanna go? How many wanna know?
How to fight demons when the planets gonna blow
Alot of ammunition gotta be packin alot of doe
Being together it is wonderful the gun was loaded one exploded
Speaking to me with the tongue he just folded
From the Tech soldier some you get blessed over
Bums they straight come from under ???
I told you, That I would die for my loved ones
Kill for my blood ones beside a cousin
Together when the evil does come
I question are you willing to plug one
Protection is one thing you need
To battle any animal coming with greed
If evil try to penetrate us and feed
Simple mathmatics demon you bleed
I know this comes off violent but this fights for love
It should not be this way but evil drew first blood
Put the ??? on your inside right wrist
So I can read and ??? like this
Thats how we know we together in a crisis
And you don't need alot of your money to buy this
Stay with me in the darkness when the light hits
I will promise your family low prices
A better war for your boys and girls might get a little
Dark and dirty before we get to the brightness
 
(Chorus)
If you come with me then I can show youuuuu
Where we'll take you where you dare not go tooooo
Follow me and let my mind control youuuuu
Where rebuild this world that will destroy youuuuu
 
(Tech N9ne - Verse 2)
The red is for the blood we all shed fighting
The black is for the nights we fight with no lighting
The white is for the clouds from witch we came flying
Landed on this jam with man and then began dieing
We slegna see dread through these retna's
We beg to be swept up by the blessed head inspecta
But all these heckless don't respect the way we lecture yu
Get next to yu, thats when the Tech pull ???
If I happen to die at the end of my run
Please give all my note books and guns to my sun
When the smoke clears I hope theres somes folks nears
To vote me as the pope here, Not quote fear is not a condition the no tears
The new club is black clothes black boots and strings
Im gonna show these non believes what mass lab producing means
 
(Chorus)
If you come with me then I can show youuuuu
Where we'll take you where you dare not go tooooo
Follow me and let my mind control youuuuu
Where rebuild this world that will destroy youuuuu
 
(Tech N9ne - Outro)
Thats right, there are people right outside these doors
that would actually attempt to be our oppositions simply
because of the love we have for each other, the love
Aint that something?
We still have our daily jobs we still pay our taxes, right
Some of you all ain't payed your taxes but we workin on it right
So what do you think the problem is? That we all dress alike?
That's petty that couldn't be it
That we helped those in any kind of trouble, thats suppose to be a good sumaritive, Right?
They evil that's why we have depression, and what do we do to evil? OWHH, (OWHH)
Off with his head
(Off with his head)
Off with his head
(Off with his head)
Off with his head. That's what I think</pre>
