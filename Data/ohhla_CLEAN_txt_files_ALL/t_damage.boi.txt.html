[Chorus: Bosko]
Sometimes I wonder how I get over
The weight of everything is tearin' up my sober
Shit is heavy like the world on my shoulder
People tellin' me be strong like a soldier
But, I suffer tremendous damage
Just make it fade away
Just let it fade away
Just make it fade away
I suffer tremendous damage

[Big Boi - singing]
So many things that I didn't know
but still I've seen my dreams come true
And now the little kids are watchin' my videos
And telling me "I wanna be you"
See, I'm just a man so I ain't scared to fall down
No matter what ever I go through
I told the man in the mirror keep pushing on
But I can't say the same about you
Nah, nah, nah, I done made it this far
And ain't no way I'm gonna turn back
I started out with no car
and graduated to a Cadillac
But all that money don't mean a got damn thing to me
Cause we don't worship that
But like the Wright brothers, you gotta crash and burn
Before you take flight, I know ya heard that

[Chorus: Bosko]
Sometimes I wonder how I get over
The weight of everything is tearin' up my sober
Shit is heavy like the world on my shoulder
People tellin' me be strong like a soldier
But, I suffer tremendous damage

[Big Boi]
February 28th, the day my daddy died
Well, not really, his energy passed to the other side
And ever since that day, I've seen him fade away with my own eyes
I never doubted God, the Marine Corps they say "semper fi"
My daddy fought in Vietnam
This is a fun fact for the bloodline of Antwan Andre
Just like this song say
I've suffered "tremendous damage," got me tougher than a motherfucker (Yeah!)
And since the days of "Player's Ball"
Y'all thought it was about all these broads and "slammin' Cadillac doors"
Nah, your American idol is just a fraud
You kiss him and he's still goin' be a frog (...ribbit)
A bitter old negro, not at all
See, I look twenty-six and still hit your broad
Still pitch a ball, hike, pass, shoot, kick and all
Practice make perfect, and first, it was Bamboo, now it's Cross
(Jackpot, nigga!)

[Chorus: Bosko]
Sometimes I wonder how I get over
The weight of everything is tearin' up my sober
Shit is heavy like the world on my shoulder
People tellin' me be strong like a soldier
But, I suffer tremendous damage
Just make it fade away
Just let it fade away
Just make it fade away
I suffer tremendous damage

...

[Chorus: Bosko]
Sometimes I wonder how I get over
The weight of everything is tearin' up my sober
Shit is heavy like the world on my shoulder
People tellin' me be strong like a soldier
But, I suffer tremendous damage
Just make it fade away
Just let it fade away
Just make it fade away
I suffer tremendous damage</pre>
