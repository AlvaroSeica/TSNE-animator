[Random]
Yeah... this should ring a bell
Random Beats... uhh
The Mega Ran project is all fun and games but
Let's get serious, yeah, yeah

You ask who produced that, move back
Tried to label me boom bap but I removed that
I keep it pimpin like minks and gators
Hard to get like tickets for the Knicks and Lakers
Jumpstart hip-hop like defibrulators
Or a school yard bully, what an instigator
Yes man never stressed man, shocked like Elecman
Make it bounce like an amateur check scam
I'm Doctor Who, does the impossible
Improbable, who do it like I can do?
Amputate, you can't ambulate
We're like distant cousins, you can't relate
Basketcase, I crash the place
It's not that I don't want to, but I just can't be fake
I tear 'em in twos, want me to fail I refuse
70's baby makin music with the spirit of "Blues"
Doubt my art, rappers get impaled with darts
Mega Ran got mo' beats than a healthy heart
Y'all can tell the event, ring the alarm, it's Big Ran
It's the bomb sort of like a terrorist threat
Yo step to the back, and get tested... no wait
I'ma just do this joint
Wait, let me just start over from the top
I can get this right

{*beat changes*}

Yo, step to the back, none testin the cat
Blessin the track, it's a fact, you ain't messin with that
Umm, don't bother comin for less than a stack
Need that guac' young boy, come better than that
From, P-H-I to P-H-X
Coast to coast they talkin but we ain't stressed
And it's, easy money when we smash and grab ya
Shelter dub money no laughin matter
We, think alike cause we joined minds
Shorty movin they waistline to tunes up and down basslines
Go to the club, I'm never runnin less
But the Mega Buster keep me kinda heavy on the wrist
Yeah - no jewels, no bodyguards
No furs, no 20 man entourage
I just do what I love, and love what I do
It's the truth, so here's what I need you to do - just dance~!

[Roseblack sings]

[Random: repeat 2X]
Dance like ain't nobody watchin
Live life 'til you ran option, no we ain't stoppin
Got to keep it poppin, front to the back
If you with me holla back like dat

[Roseblack sings to fade]</pre>
