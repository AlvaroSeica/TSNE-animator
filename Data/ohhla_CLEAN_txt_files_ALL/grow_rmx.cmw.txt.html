* Included one more verse than were in the previous release (Fourth Verse)

[Verse One: MC Eiht]
Growing up in the hood, yeah boy nineteen eighty four
Was the year my peers; didn't know what was in store
A little hard head kid came abase
Time to pay my dues, learn the tricks of the trade
And at home, it's the same ass story
Mom's treat me like she don't even know me
But my younger brother has got much clout
I can't take this shit so I bounced the hell out
And rolled with the pack of wicked motherfuckers
No shorts are taken, we're down black brothers
A little kid with no problems at all
Fucked up and dealt my first 8-ball
Quick up the stairs so little sucker stop looking
Stagger to the house so I can collect my whooping
But watch out cause a little nigga is up to no good
Growing up in the hood

[Chorus: DJ Slip scratching Quotes below]
Life ain't nothing but bitches and money ----&gt; Ice Cube
Come On! Yeah!
Cause in the city, you live and let die -----&gt; Ice Cube
Come On! Yeah!
Where I'm at, if you're soft, you're lost ---&gt; KRS-One

[Verse Two: MC Eiht]
I got hard times; and will I escape sometimes I wonder!
Cause it just seems that the hood done took me under
Police sweat my tip and keep harassing
Trying to lock me up cause I keep on blasting
Community trying to shut me out
But the money keeps flowing and I got much clout
With the cluckers, the brother back street punk suckers
Try to break me out fool, you be a shorter than motherfucker
Always strapping, eager to peel a cap
I set up a trap, put you quick into a nap
Cause I grew up fast on the wrong side of the law
So watch me take eight to your jaw
Don't enter my hood homeboy
Not a robot cop, a robot gangster ready to destroy
I take chances cause life to me ain't no good
Growing up in the hood

[Chorus: DJ Slip scratching Quotes below]
Compton is the city that I'm claiming -------&gt; MC Eiht
Come On! Yeah!
Where I'm at, if you're soft, you're lost ---&gt; KRS-One
Come On! Yeah!
Compton is the city that I'm claiming -------&gt; MC Eiht
Come On! Yeah!

[Verse Three: MC Eiht]
Nineteen eighty seven, I'm back on the scene
Out of jail, I'm legit and I'm fucking up shit
I'm ready to peel a punk's caps
And I heard that my hood was making snaps
As I precede to make my riches
Just like the neighborhood kingpin, pimping all these bitches
Task force trying to roll deep
But I'm playing these punk fools cheap
Niggaz rolled by and try to blast, it didn't work
I've seen the bullets flying and fool, I hit the dirt
Bullet flies through the window
Hits my brother, screams out my mother
As I'm rolling, I'm hitting my switches
Looking for the punk-ass sons of bitches
I found them, before I kill them, I said you fucked up good
Growing up in the hood

[Chorus: DJ Slip scratching Quotes below]
Compton is the city that I'm claiming -------&gt; MC Eiht
Come On! Yeah!
Life ain't nothing but bitches and money ----&gt; Ice Cube
Come On! Yeah!
Compton is the city that I'm claiming -------&gt; MC Eiht
Come On! Yeah!
Cause in the city, you live and let die -----&gt; Ice Cube
Come On! Yeah!

[Verse Four: MC Eiht]
Now, I'm in a thick shit and can't think cause I'm drunk
One Time is on my ass cause I done murdered the punk
So I layed low in the cut
Got my homies on watching a jam leery as fuck
Keep my gats on you
Fuck! the police, I heard his homies trying to get me too
But I learned punk fool ain't no sleeping
The store is packed when I start my creeping
Police is hot, but I'm watching my back
And yeah, I'm from the streets so I'm smarter than that
The boys is mad, and they wanna deal me
His punk friends is sad, and they're trying to kill me
It was a saying in the hood we have; If they blast (*Gun Cocked*)
We blast right back on their ass
And to my homies I'm a Loc, yeah that feels good
Growing up in the hood

[Chorus: DJ Slip scratching Quotes below]
Compton is the city that I'm claiming -------&gt; MC Eiht
Come On! Yeah!
Life ain't nothing but bitches and money ----&gt; Ice Cube
Come On! Yeah!
Compton is the city that I'm claiming -------&gt; MC Eiht
Come On! Yeah!
Life ain't nothing but bitches and money ----&gt; Ice Cube
Come On! Yeah!

[Verse Five: MC Eiht]
A brother is on the run, I've got my cash in a stash box
Wanted cause I'm serving them the potent fat rocks
And my face is like a household name
Everybody warns their kids about the dope game
But I'm still making my profit
And the One Time is just can't stop it
So I keep hiding my face
No time to waste, they got me on the chase
Now the neighborhood is on my line
Cause some punk ass fool done drop the dime
5-0 hit my door at 8:00 O'clock
Rush to the toilet so I can flush the rock
Out the backdoor, Freeze!! I heard a shout
Am I sure? - yo, I guess I got no clout
But it's murder one and I'm the victim, damn, that ain't good
Growing up in the hood

[Outro: DJ Slip scratching Quotes below until fade]
Life ain't nothing but bitches and money ----&gt; Ice Cube
Come On! Yeah!
Cause in the city, you live and let die -----&gt; Ice Cube
Come On! Yeah!</pre>
