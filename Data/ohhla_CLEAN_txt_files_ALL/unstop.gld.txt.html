Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
I've got to be unstoppable {*2X*}
Ey-ey-ey-ey! You don't lie {*2X*}

[Santigold]
0-0-7 mission and it's just one day
I marked my position then I ran away
Got these boots made for walkin and some pepper spray
My two guns in my pocket 'cause it's brick today
I said, "Hey Mrs. Parker, can I get your spot?"
The block's too hot, no parking lot
The joker cops, they ticket, take my cash
The boys on the block got eyes for my ass

[Chorus]

[Santigold]
Last stop Franklin, smell it makes me sick
Got my street vision on, I don't see shit
And still I stay fresh I spend the top dollar
Cause on my block the knockoffs are fi-yah
Meet me at the J where they got the domino game locked
Boy cross the street with tight pants on
Get your hipster ass on down to the Beacon
I fly right past him, don't take my mask off

[Chorus]

[Santigold]
I got the talk, the beat and bass
Give me one I'll take it make you lose your place
Tell me I-I-I can play so I speed up the pace
I break it break it you can't stop me in this race

[Chorus]</pre>
