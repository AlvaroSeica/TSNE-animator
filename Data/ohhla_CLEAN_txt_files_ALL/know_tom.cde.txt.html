I know tomorrow's gonna bring another sunrise
I know tomorrow's coming 'cause I see the moonlight
I know tomorrow promises a happy new life
But tonight, there's no tomorrow in my eyesight

[Off Topic]
If I'm trapped in this world of mine
I'm gonna tap my mind and unwrap a rhyme
That'll stand to the test of time
Rep rap to the best of mine
CP gonna redefine hip-hop
Off Top and Phase Fate replace the heads of state
And straight dictate
To the un-brain-white-washed robot people
Telling you my lyrical content's evil
See through the costumes and see what the hand that feeds you is connected to
Wires and receptacles, electrical, without a soul
With a chip in your head and a barcode
Stayed tuned for the episodes
And expose your brain lobes to subliminals
Turn choirs to criminals
Great minds go to war with questionable intellectuals
Y'all shouldn't take the drugs I take
That's a mistake
You ain't ready for it, boy
Stay baked
You ain't ready for the boy Off Topic
Man, you ain't even a prospect
Too ill to hate
I got a feeling
Something is real and about to reveal itself
Rain down though the ceiling
Gonna touch you, clean you, start the healing
No shelter - standing or kneeling
No sides to pick and no time to choose
Can't win, not a game
Either way, can't lose
What a shame, all the time we spent on the rules
What a waste, all the money we spent on the tools
Rhyme sick til the spit makes a puddle of drool
And we drown in the beats of the record pool
Gotta learn real quick how to fight like new
We swallowed the bait, now it's time for a breakthrough

I know tomorrow's gonna bring another sunrise
I know tomorrow's coming 'cause I see the moonlight
I know tomorrow promises a happy new life
But tonight, there's no tomorrow in my eyesight

		Think about what you wan' do
		Sign o' the times
		Mark your minds with Intel inside
		Microsoft shell thick-skinned
		You think you're exempt from the pig's grin?
		Think ya better listen
		This ain't a game like pigskin
		But it's playoff
		Count down to elimination
		Minds elevated to elation
		Drugged-up with Reality TV
		To replace your family
		The peak of American culture's passed
		'55 could never last
		Now accelerated fast like a particle collision
		On the path set in motion since the day of atonement
		Yeah ya always known it
		Just hoped it was down the road
		A little more
		Thought you'd die before you'd see a computer chip lie to your face
		Now they watch what you all do, every move
		Evening news, nothing but death and destruction
		Not 'cause it's new, but because you eat it up, son
		Sucks to be you, on the horizon, sun's rising
		Fireside, best seats on which to get fried
		Testify, did you witness the crime?
		Did you sit back and wait to die?
		The fittest survive, that's fine by me
		But the fit have a hit list
		Whose name will they find?
		I'll tell you who's on my shit list
		When I rip this track
		Listen to the words, don't just hear the rap
		On the streets will you holla back?
		Motherfuckers, can you follow that?
		Don't play the game and they don't get richer
		And hence we don't get poorer, get the picture?
		Don't play the stocks, keep your money in your mattress
		Cut up the plastic and you cut off the fascists
