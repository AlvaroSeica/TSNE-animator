this reality is fantastic
tootsie rolls, sushi
caramel apples in baskets
people made of flesh
no one knows of plastic
misery, misery, don't try to fight it
just crawl to your wall and flip the lightswitch
and if it's the truth best believe I'll write it
ha ha ha I look in the sky
ha ha ha with a blink of an eye
seagulls, turn to teradactyles
what's an a-hole? I paint smiles with pastels
I'm past ill
forget sand, I'm using bricks for castles
god save the queen, cause the king ain't dead
she cheated on him, in his own bed
but its all right, cause its tuesday night
and I ain't got nothing to fight, except the daylight

I look up at the stars like christmas lights
give me a kiss, put on your lipstick tonite
I'm standing on the edge saying chris take flight
I'm standing on the edge thinking chris just might

this reality is fantastic
pig tails, pomegranates
panties and elastic
the mountains look like big ol' camels
girls take out your tongue rings its bad for your enamel
I see canaries and toucans parrots and ferrets
eggplants, onions, and platinum carrots
children, toddlers, uncles and parents
all in the shade of fuschia flourescent
shake off the uranium, its gonna be all right
that smile doesnt have to be permanent just be polite
everyone's holding hands singing koombyah
I'm sitting back with a long island ice tea and a straw
blink once it's purple, blink twice its yellow
blink 3 it's green
if you gotta lightswitch then you know what I mean
close your eyes and watch the lightshow
let your hand off the wheel
cause you're going down the right road
read the word forgive then throw down your bible
I walked to the edge and took a step off
the fall is fantastic, it still hasnt stopped
but it's all right, cause its tuesday night
and I ain't got nothing to fight
except the daylight x 2

I look up at the stars like christmas lights
give me a kiss, put on your lipstick tonite
I'm standing on the edge saying chris take flight
I'm standing on the edge thinking chris just might

doctype ain't got nothing to fight
input ain't got nothing to fight
extra kool ain't got nothing to fight
awareness ain't got nothing to fight
satyr ain't got nothing to fight
dirty lab ain't got nothing to fight
big time ain't got nothing to fight
ac ain't got nothing to fight
fantastic ain't got nothing to fight</pre>
