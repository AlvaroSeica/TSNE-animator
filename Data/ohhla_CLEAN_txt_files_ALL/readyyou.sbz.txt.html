[Supreme]
I got a job, and that's at least too good, tops
Clap clap, the sounds of the glock cock means you pop
?Clap after me?, the boss throughout the lost throughout the earth son
The G-O-D dunn, steady livin
Ain't no surprising on how I do this
Learned my thug ways from troopers and busting of luger lugers
Gotta get mines in the raw way, that's all they used to say
Throughout the way, Supreme, you got to parlay
Word up before you get yourself hurt up
Bitch shut up before you be my next murda
Pass the chrome toasta, I ??? ya, your life is ova

[Papoose]
I got nothin but bullets for ya'll new crime cowards
Half of my life I had to do crime, count it
So I'm bout it ten times for all ya'll two time bout its
I dusted my pistol just to get the true shine out it
Double my nickels, a few dime sprouted
Before chromed out ride, real thugs'll take a chromed out nine
Street smarts speak with a milked out mind
Sell out, you sold out, die
Willies get car jacked, blown out rides
I keep niggas runnin for cover like it's cold outside
Moody but calm, been on brothas just like Louis Batton
Truly my palm push more wigs than beauty salons
Stab wound, slug wound, we in the same boat
My gat cut thugs and shoot em on the same note

[Freestyle]
Mr. Short, Dark And Handsome, got any threats by expansion
I'm fly like Air One, kidnap your grandson for ransom
Revolve it like a hundgun, with one left in the chamber
You brave, but to be saved, seek that baby in the major
To kill ten bird with one stone, a hundred with two
A thousand with three, I stalk through heaven, hell, and purgatory
So never mind your story, cuz all your shit is null and void
To keep the earth from being destroyed, NASA called me to deflect the asteroid
The circumstance is like a ninja running through your white washed
world form of the toxic avenger
Through comprehension, attention all top billers, a bigger size does matter
You get splattered to prove the God's iller

[Chorus: OMN999 &amp; Ma Barker (Ma Barker)]
Ready you're not (My niggas rock)
Ready you're not, ready you're not (Blow up your spot)
Ready you're not, ready you're not (Making shit hot)
Ready you're not, ready you're not, what what, ready you're not

[Ma Barker]
(OMN999: Ayo Shaqueen)
I raise hell like I carried it for nine months, excel it
Beyond other bitches yelling
Wack shit on wack tracks, tryin to get their spot back
They need to stop that, take heed, the heat's cocked back
You bleed, got that? Plus I rock that sick, off the wall shit
You ??? white witches downfall
So while my steez equal zero, point zero zero weightlist
Fuck vaseline, you better rock a world up mad tryin to fake this
Cuz in this rat race, bitch, I play first and last
That's my word to gas, tryin to get your word in last, and I'ma hurt your ass
Plus Shaqueen ain't playin, you be layin on your back
With your jaw cracked, so watch what you say

[Shabazz the Disciple]
We on some Roundtable, split the growth shit
Break bread, family toast shit, lyrical overdose, snakes give up the ghost
Live by the thug Bible, slingin lyrical drugs for survival
Up in the club, duckin and bustin slugs like in Rivals
I weigh grams with Five Percenters and the thinner sinners
Playin roulette in this game of thieves and barrel spinners
Scarfaces with open cases, federal subpeonas
Runnin the streets with two felonies and multiple misdomeanors
When thugs die, we bust slugs in the sky
Pop champagne bottles and campaign with modern spies
Crack ladies giving birth to crack babies in this black Hades
You get clapped in your Ac or your Mercedes

[T-Slugz]
I'm beyond John Blaze, live on the front page
See me without a gauge in a suberb with herb, getting blazed
Ya'll fronted on my hood, saying we ain't gonna get paid
Ya'll cats got me slagged cuz we rap a strange name
The difference between ya'll and us, the size of the guage
And how we all about fame, and how ya'll all about games
We stay strictly biz, rob kids, dip them pigs
Slide to the crib, count the dough, see how we did
I'mma make it plain and simple, do not walk across the boarders
You be here today, gone the next, body floating in the water
Niggas don't got cellies, they just be fronting on the callers
And they shorties be like "Damn, Slug's a real New Yorker"

[OMN999]
Lord Ominous, trip, non scientist, with that sick pyscho shit
Quick to let iron spit, better projectiles enter flesh like biochips
Code red, beams gleam from the tech
And reflect off of objects like for about a sec, then connect
You wack, now ??? hit, my team wrecks shit
Ready to set shit, niggas want static (fuck)
You found to death be electric, doused with acid
Got this ?? shit mastered, my underground basement ???
Got rap faggots shivering up in addicts
Seventh dimension, my index finger itching
Living where there's no pot to piss in
Where niggas getting locked up in prison, bitches striping
When I bust shots, they're not missing
See I got bitches that'll fuck you to sleep, wake up with your cock missing
Glock ticking, plot thickens, I start sickin my dogs on niggas
To shake em down and strip jewels off of niggas
I break em down from matter to molecules to atoms to ???
Blow his spot in the summer time, like particles, turn the world dark
Brain puncture, the only way you could fuck with Omen is if you ran a
train on your mother, mothafucker</pre>
