[Travie McCoy]
Yeah! Just wakin up in the morning and to be well
quite honest wit'cha, I ain't really sleep well
Ya ever feel like your train a thoughts been derailed?
That's when you press on - Lee Nails
Half the population's just waitin to see me fail
Yeah right, you're better off tryin to freeze hell
Heh, some of us do it for the females
And others do it for the retails
But I do it for the kids life through the towel in on
Everytime you fall it's only makin your chin strong
And I'll be in your corner like Big baby
'Til the end or when you hear this song from that big lady

[Chorus] + (Ryan Tedder)
Until the referee rings the bell
Until both your eyes start to swell
Until the crowd goes home
What we gon' do y'all?
(Give 'em hell, turn their heads)
(Gonna live life till we're dead)
(Give me scars, give me pain)
(Then they'll say to me, say to me, say to me)
(There goes a fighter, there goes a fighter)
(Here comes a fighter)
(That's what they'll say to me, say to me)
(Say to me, this one's a fighter)

[Travie McCoy]
May the vodka last thirty rounds
There's no reason you should ever have your head down
Six foot five, two hundred and twenty pounds
Hailing from Rock Bottom, Loserville, Nothing Town
Textbook version of the kid goin nowhere fast
And now I'm yellin "kiss my ass"
It's gon' take a couple right hooks, a few left jabs
for you to recognize that you really ain't got it bad

[Chorus]

[Travie McCoy]
Everybody put your fists up
What we gon' do? What we gon' do?
What we gon' do? Tell 'em what we gon' do y'all
What we gon' do? What we gon' do?
What we gon' do? You know what we gon' do
If you fall pick yourself up off the floor (get up)
And when your bones can't take no more
Just remember what you're here for
Cause I know I'ma damn sure

[Chorus] - Ryan Tedder part only

[Travie McCoy]
'Til the referee rings the bell
'Til both your eyes start to swell
'Til the crowd goes home
What we gon' do kid?</pre>
