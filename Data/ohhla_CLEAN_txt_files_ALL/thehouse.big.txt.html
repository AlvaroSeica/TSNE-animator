sippin on fours and we riding on threes I must confess
cause with some of the best know go on give us our card
and you can keep the rest we holdin it down

[Lil'Flip]
Now when you see me on the streets I'm smokin sweets
and I always keep a bad broad close to me
long hair yella bone wit a college degree
I see Big T. number on my caller I.D.
he say we gotta do a show at the bayou classic
if you cant see we ballin then you need glasses
I'ma million dollar star thats how I carry  myself
can't no girl brake my heart cause I'ma marry myself
can't no girl brake my heart cause I'ma man myself
I represent the south side of Houston, Texas
I can't drive a Acura cause I'm used to Lexus
Have you ever seen a watch wit big ol' princess
I live in a condo wit big ol' fences
and everytime I drop a song I'm showin my spine
all I need is a 8 to go wit my pound
I'm the coldest Rap Star thet you ever saw
Platinum got me lookin like I gotta metal jaw

(Chorus 2)
ladda la la la la la
Big T. in the house tonight
