Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Like walkin on the moon was such a good feeling
I'm lyin in bed and I'm starin at the ceilin
Can't wake up on Monday morning
Thinkin about work makes me yawn and
As I look outside it's rainin, pourin
Cats and dogs don't wanna think no more
About when I gotta get up and get out my bed
I'd rather sleep and smoke a b-load instead
Because the harder you try the less you succeed
Don't try at all and get everything you need
Because the harder you fall the more it's gon bleed
Watch where you stepping cause you best not step on me

If you're ugly on the outside it don't matter
If the beauty on the inside it over powers
If the beauty on the outside it wont matter
If you're ugly on the inside then I don't want

And if you the type of person getting no recognition
Reach inside your pocket feelin all your money missin
And you wanna shoot your gunz but you got no ammunition
Open up your mind, body, soul and take a listen

The harder you try the less you succeed
Don't try at all and get everything you need
Because the harder you fall the more it's gon bleed
Watch where you stepping cause you best not step on me

It's always hard when you're workin for the other man
Tryin to make a dollar with the palms of my empty hands
It seems so easily but it never seems to last long
Thinkin that you got it for a minute then a minutes gone</pre>
