[Chorus]
Smooth be my name gospel rap is my game
I represent Christ not a thing here changed
Some wanna playa hate yet I remain the same
And I won't sellout to the money and the fame|

[Verse 1]
Now let me introduce myself Smooth be the name
Not new to the game I gospel rap like it ain't no thang
You may have heard me with the group K2S
Been doing this for years through the blood sweat and tears
When other groups faded we always kept on
Don't know how we made it but we always stood strong
So now I'm on my own doing the same ol thang
Blazing mics getting hype with the different kind of swing
You think you know me but I'm not the same person
Still in the same routine everyday straight serving
Same smooth flow but it's whole notha day
Got you swaying to the track industry give way
There ain't no holding back I'm about to breakthrough
Every single thing that they said I wouldn't do
Cause I'm more than a conqueror all things I can do
And I'll say it one more time just in case you're wondering who

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Some people try to stop what I do even if they don't succeed
They rather plant a bad seed spawning off a bad breed
I saw the need and the hunger and began to feed
That's why I'm bound to take you higher just like Creed
I'm just a messenger going about my tactics
So don't mess with me cause God's got my back kid
My name is Smooth but I'm rough like sandpaper
Nobody's gonna stop me like Shaq from the Lakers
I'm on mission and I'm itching for some lost souls
So pay attention what I mention is valuable
Ain't no kidding how ya livin's gonna truly say
If it's a given your forgiven of your sins today
Who you represent What's it gonna be
Is it life or death Get on your knees and plea
Were more than conquerors all things we can do
And I'll say it one more time just incase your wondering who

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I'm not quitting any time soon I'm making waves
Through your city like a monsoon
Giving you beats you can bump in your car boom
Bringing the heat I'm going national like lampoon and worldwide
So lay back and ride with me now
Proclaim the father if you don't then I'll show you how
It aint no bother everybody all together now
get your hands up
Smooth two-thousand and one now that's what's up

[Chorus]</pre>
