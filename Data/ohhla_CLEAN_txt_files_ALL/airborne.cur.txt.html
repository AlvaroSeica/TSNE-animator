[Verse]
I'm gettin hella mail from jail, niggas tellin me to kill it
When they get out I'll bring them 'round some bitches
Shinobi how I kick it, American Ninja, major motion picture
Flippin my remote, same way I do them hoes
But she already know before she touch my Chevy door
Real nigga, lemme make it as clear as my windows
No square shall enter in the circle of winners
Know I'm prepared for whatev, you know what I been thru
Rearview, Clear vision, memories of paid dues
Confined to a runway, thunderstorms came thru
But look what it came to, somethin' that amazes you
soon as you quit hatin' and hear what I gotta say to you
Baby blue, souls D's, White 11, '96
No retro card came with this
Same year, my Impala with the floor shift
4-door suicide, Muscle car chauffeured
Shawty body chocolated, Russel Stover
Brung weed wit' her whenever I invite her over
Polo sweater, tether belt hangin' off her shoulder
No care, over here, so we put it in the air
Walkin' 'round my house, say she wanna fuck errywhere
That's cool baby, but I just got that pool table
We ain't gotta stay away from it, It's all good
if you wanna get under it, then I guess I can fuck with it
Before I got on this beat, it made out a bucketlist
and these boys, I granted his deathwish
Legendary lay-up Jordan with the right-left switch
Hang time, Hand glide, Stir fried, Chanky-eyed, Shanghai
Candy rain, drizzle frame, I ride
'87 Corvette ZR1, to the T-top softened
put 'em in the trunk bitch, all gassed up, she been drinkin' from the pump
That's all bad, tryna pass, fucked around and crashed
Bitches all flip, Fools tryna make it last
Emotional luggage, nothin' of it, I don't check bags
I just carry-on, leave that bullshit in the past
Half Rose, Sean Don, OJ in my glass
Mimosa, Testarossa program, Prota-J curriculum
doors open like a pendulum swingin
Rock in my Jetset Emblem
Fool is to serve like Wimbledon, Interior cinnamon
the car that I'm sittin' in, Calm my bad nerves, I call her my Ritalin
Just kiddin, not pillin', just element twistin'
From the herb come the fire and the wind I'm livin
not pillin', just element twistin'
From the herb come the fire and the wind I'm livin
From the herb come the fire and the wind I'm livin
Yeauhh

[Outro]

Jets, where haven't we
