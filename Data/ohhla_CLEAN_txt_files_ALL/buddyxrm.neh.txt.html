You call your self a family man
talking about your family's plans
to bring the sweet talk deep and down
works better than the average pickup line
you put your woman out to pasture
on the promises you gave her last year
peace and love is on your head
the grass is greener playin around
your family seed is what you spread

Chorus x1

Buddy my friend
yeah yeah yeah yeah
who you think you fooling 
Buddy my friend
yeah yeah yeah yeah
and what about your woman 
Buddy my friend
yeah yeah yeah yeah
who you think you fooling 
Buddy,Buddy my friend


I don't care what you do
but there's a hypocrite that lives in you
cause if your woman gave her love
in the same way that you do
you'd feel a way ya know ya would

Chorus x1

Buddy my friend
yeah yeah yeah yeah
who you think you fooling 
Buddy my friend
yeah yeah yeah yeah
and what about your woman 
Buddy my friend
yeah yeah yeah yeah
who you think you fooling 
Buddy,Buddy my friend

Treat her that way
and you'll be X'ed soon
Buddy X 2
Treat her that way 
you'll be X'ed soon
Buddy X 2

It's better to be safe than sorry
but ya gonna be sorry when it's too late
Buddy

Oh yeah Buddy

First of all you got me mixed up with
Somebody ya done slept with done crept with
but its too smooth to fall but I stick and move
stick and move I'm in the power moves the shower moves
butt naked ya know ya love it when i lick it
some honeys says I'm lovely but Nenah says I'm wicked
look at you you ain't no betta 
walking around in ya tight sweater ya long leather
you and ya friends always together
no time for the B-I-G so I'm O-U-T
the sex was great but the headaches I can't take
I think I made a very big mistake</pre>
