[Holocaust]
According to the legend, the German town of Hamelin was infested by rats
One day, a man dressed in a suit of many colors walked into Hamelin with a large hat
And offered to rid the town of the pests, for a sum of money
When the mayor aggreed, the man drew out a pipe, nothing funny
And walked on along the streets playing a haunting tune of haunted sooth
All the rats came tumbling out of the house, and followed doom
In a hollowed noon, yes, the Pied Piper to the west of river
Where they all venacular were drowned, and folklore when the Piper claimed his reward
The big mayor refused to pay him like a hound
The Piper swore vengeance, once more he walked along the streets
Playing a strange melody, quite like how the rats fell asleep
But this time all children listened deep, and ran from their homes
And followed him to a cave, in a near by hill
The cave closed upon on 'em, and the children were still never seen again, for real...

In Greek mythology, the craftsmen and inventor, Daedalus pending
After killing his apprentice Talos, in envy
He fled from Greece to Crete, the Minotaur was a monster with the head
Of a bull, and the body of a man, a tale haunting in the land
And in that time, the crash and Daedalus constructed the Labyrinth
In which, the monster was confined
At the order of the King of Crete, he built the Minotaur's Labyrinth
To house the Minotaur, many hero's wouldn't battle him
The Labyrinth was an intricate building of chambers and passages
Constructed walls high and so asked, too complex and confused
A person inside, Daedalus' creation, the King of Crete enventually forced Athens to pay him
An annual tribute to seven youths and seven maidens
These are set up inside the Labyrinth, where they either starve or will devour
Finally Theseus joined the group of the victims and killed the Minotaur
Rain showered, and Daedalus, when the King refused to let him leave Crete
Daedalus built wings of wax and feathers unique
For himself and his son Icarus, together they flew away
But Icarus few too close to the sun, dunn, and that day
And fell to his death, when the wax in his wings melted late
Then after to Sicily, Daedalus escaped...</pre>
