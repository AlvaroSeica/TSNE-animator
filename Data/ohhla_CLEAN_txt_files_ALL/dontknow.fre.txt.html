Typed by: Cno Evil

[Chorus: ?]
I don't know, exactly I want
But if you ask, I'll say it's nothing
Cuz I need it...
The family, that is what you did for me
It's the most beautifullest thing
And girl, I need it...

[Free Murda]
Girl, you see Free, cruising down Myrtle
Cutie with a booty, Murda want to Earth to you
Duty color Gucci, down to the first two
Get groovy in a kuffi, ma, don't want to hurt you
I want fire, I demand that purple
To make me get higher than the pants on Urkel
We listen to Mariah, play Kells when I work you
You heard my Oscar Meyer ring bells like church do
Watch I crash 'em, but not raw doggy dog
Pull out the Magnum, it gon' be a forty-four
Yo, I'm high as shit, toss up that Remy, ma
I hope you ride stick, ain't talking your rented car
Tired of my chips, going to the titty bar
I'd rather you in my whip, blowing through the city, ma
I'm like uh, give it to me shorty
Ain't nice like Santa, give it to me naughty

[Chorus]

[Free Murda]
Trying to take you to that Montecarlo
Mavado, tell me that it's time to depart, yo
Out of N.Y., mami vene
Qui, it's me, mami can I
Rub on your skin like lotion, I'm open
Like a store in the morning, I'm home and
Right in my 36-36
E.V.'s is where the dirty miss, I need you
Raw and please you, I hope that it's lethal
Like me higher than a math sign, I hope we equal
Towards paparazzi, a 'killa cam' like Rico
Know I'm tryin' to get 'paid in full' off people
Like me, it's in the game, ma
On you like Tai Chi, even bought you a ring, ma
I don't sing, ma, but I rap
Your hips is like Busta, I make it clap

[Chorus]

[Free Murda]
I wanna call you when I want to, see you when I need you
Ain't no other dude could treat you like Free do
Girl I'm cool, even gave you keys to
The AMG, come, hang with me
And we can smoke that la-la-la-la, like Jay-Z
I want me a ride or die, lady
Something like E-V-E, whoe'll hide the A.V.
In her purse, she ain't tired or lazy
Damn, you so fine, we can do dinner and sip on fine wine
I don't swing, girl, get that out your mind, a flat waistline
Let me hit that from behind, my style genuine
I'm a Brooklyn baby, bump and grind, have your hair
Looking crazy, I do that on the regular
Her milkshake make the boys wanna go to bed with her
Said alot of things that I wish I never said to her

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
