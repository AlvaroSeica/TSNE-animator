[Pro the Leader]
I throw a pipe bomb under your family, man, like Nicolas Cage
My pen fills the page, rewind to the iller days
My heart still feels the pain, from all the dirt I did
But like Ol' Dirt, we will forever live
We gotta do better for our kids are playing catch up
Only a few make it, the rest fucked
You in a circle, I'm in the batter's box hitting homeruns
In the bottom of the 9th, to the plate you'll never get to step up
This is just practice, I can't wait until the season start
I tear MC's apart, take you out, leave the art
Homey right there, he ain't even hard
Don't underestimate your opponents, we're the American Poets
On the beat, next verse, is the White Lotus
I refuse to work with Nick Fury and S.H.I.E.L.D.
I wield the mic, you yield at the light and then we cash you up
To be like me, you couldn't even steal the right
I stand my ground and fight, we'll see who's left by the end of the night

[White Lotus]
Yo, I fly over the ocean and smoke spliffs
With the American Poets, up early, sunrise over the porch steps
Witness the morning of your death, son, I ghost you
You've been exposed to the Lotus virus, computer mind
Design to cause a cystic chip, techtonic plates
I possess God's gift to disarm a snake
Slaughter with blades, murder a serpent, kill you with curse of G
Caddy your nervous knees, soon my word, just heard you bleed
Disturb your sleep with stigmata, machete opera
Deadly photographer, take your head shot
One third eye lens, must picture the red art
Give you an offering, head start, before my track
Need refreshed darts, catch a spear to the chest
Scarred for life, when I start to slice
Ride the skies of heavenly melody, with my armored mind
Thoughts rule time, in my heart grew styles
I'm rival to manifest, and ramble your neck
More ammo to spread, while I'm rocking this
The chief sneak up from behind, ripout your esophagus

[Nova Kane]
Yo, gatling gun grenade rage, rhymes just blow out the page
The cypher's infinite, yo, increase like the crime rate
The mind state of blind hate, blizzard type, irate
Twelve thousand years deep, trapped inside a dark cage
My heart sound explosive shockwaves and rusty popos
Dusty words spoken, leave you open like the ocean
The skull fire eye flames, war journal, mind blaze
Super like Nintendo, dead boys float on fast waves
A punisher's legacy, faggots can't step to these
Ya'll don't hold weight, son, I bury your density
Outlast four rappers, for I sleuth them well
The last king of shadows, from grace he fell
Haunted by my memories, the new face of doom
Leave your castle in ruins, can't stop what we're doing
Smoking out Capone's bones, and dirty crack rooms
Write my names in walls in old bathrooms

[sample]
So I'm taking it back, taking 'em all back

[Holocaust]
Without a whole lot of skulls, it just wouldn't be Skull Island
In the ring, King Kong whores, in the jungle, there's dinosaurs
The distant trees are gradually fading out into the smoke
Look at the shores, built by hand, some ancient civilization we have wars
In the hallway for son, punch you, slam you into a wall
Thrust you through a window, you fall down nine floors
The killer of MC's still at large
I've been wanting to bomb you since 1944
Knock on, merely sleeping, prepare to be blown away in time
You shout, if there is anybody in this house, please give me a sign
They bury their dead outside of their city's walls
We do carry out the state's death sentence here
Pineapple gallery, a fat guy with a suitcase
There is not enough sunlight for an alligator to live
We walk through the arc, and we had entered noise there
Some dark, forget it, kid, this is my country and my constant
You get a birth certificate and in television for being a citizen
There is a blue marble butterfly in a cave or a tunnel
When I open the door, of this gas chamber
Man, click-click, put that, little gun down
Place the money on the table, and scram</pre>
