Typed by: Rekaniz@aol.com

Voice: You know there comes a period in every womans life when
 she gets frustrated or fed up with her man and all his silly hangups
 You know a woman wants a man where she dont have to have no drama
 behind it You know jus somebody like to love her down with
 no strings attached and his name is "Splackavellie"

 Tell me what kind of superman
 Would take u in his bedroom baby
 and hit u with some front back and side to side
 Like hydrolics on a stormy night
 And break u off sumthin proper like
 Aint no need fo u to perpertrate 
 Cause he will accomadate
 and u will aprecciate tha way he flips u up down and round and round
 In and out and make u scream and shout
 Shortie put your thang down down down

[Bridge]
He aint ya boyfriend
He aint ya husband
Just sumbody u can call when your body needs a fix
He'll put u in tha mix
Den youll hear him askin whats my name say my name
Splackavellie

[Chorus]
 Every woman needs here own Splackavellie
 A brotha she can call when her man aint doin her right
 He can work it all night
 Until tha morning light
 Make her feel right right right
 Every woman needs that one Splackavellie
 A brotha she can call when her man aint doin her right
 He can work it all night
 Until tha morning light
 Make her feel right right right

 Tell me what kind of superman
 Would make u feel good with his mouth
 And kiss u from your earring to your bellychain
 Then go down a little further mayn
 Its allright baby aint no shame
 Drop tha top on his Mercades Benz
 So her legs can feel tha wind
 As he hits again and again and again Its all good yeah
 because Im bout it bout it baby im bout it bout it baby

 [Bridge]

 [Chorus]

 uh ohhh uh uh ahhh ahhh ahhh sounds so good
 Yeahhhh 

 Whats my name spell my name Yeahhh
 S-p-l-a-c-k-a-v-e-l-l-i-e
 Splackavellie
