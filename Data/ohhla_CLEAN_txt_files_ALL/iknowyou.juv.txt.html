[Trey Songz - singing]
Oh, Oh, Oh, Ooh, Oh, Oh
Ooh, Ooh, Ooh, Oh, Oh

put ya feet up in my shoes for a minute
shawty peep the way I do how I'm living
you steadily trippin, say I'm trickin with the women
girl don't make me get to trippin everything is what I'm givin, I know

[Juvenile]
I know I'm comin home to big fine after my day done
all concerned about how I'm feelin and if I ate somethin
you always hear the bullshit stories and never say nothin
cause all of 'em in search for a man that's why they stay sufferin
though you may think I'm from this bitch to the next
a nigga be out here tryna get him a check, but I prefer cash
for me and you so don't even much get ya nerves bad
they want attention and they don't even deserve that
girl you miss Juv-E what you think I don't care
What you think I'm bout to go sacrifice this shit for that there
they wanna catch the biggest fish in the sea-but he ain't swimmin
cause he satisfied and ain't lookin forward to other women

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
I know, you know (I know, you know)
just cause they shakin-don't mean I'm takin
I know, you know (you know, yeah)
just cause they holla-don't mean I follow
I know, you know (you know, baby)
just cause they throw it-don't mean I'm catchin
I know, you know (you know)
no matter how long I'm gone-I'm always comin home to you

[Juvenile]
You gotta believe me, you don't have to police me
I be up in the streets makin sure that me and you eat see
women try to tease me but I tell 'em be easy
my family needs me so I'm goin where my seeds be
I can sign ya poster but I cannot intercourse ya
they really wanna solider that's why the bendin it over
holla at big daddy I'm comin home like I 'ppose ta
with a big ole bag of groceries and somethin that we can smoke up
we don't need a passion cause me and you is what's happenin
they thought we wasn't adaptin now everybody congratin
forget all of that yappin as long as we keep interactin
and we keep on attractin to each other with a passion

[Chorus]

[Juvenile]
When the big dog is in ya they gon'wanna bother a G
wanna leave way at night and come tomorrow with me
yup so they can put a nigga business all in the streets
out here tellin folks she gotta problem recordin for keeps
she got big (???)tryna get me to the place
hopin I reconize her curve but I can't even relate
now they be at the red light flashin me with they head lights
I know how to play it like tell 'em to get they head right
I'm not tryna touch her so you can keep ya lil'rubber
you too young for me why ya tryna get me in trouble
she know that I love her-look we was meant for each other
and she gon' act a fool when she with me under the cover

[Chorus] - repeat to end</pre>
