[Verse 1: Slug]
I love you like a rap kid loves breaks

[Chorus: Slug]
Dirty, dirty, you're such a dirty girl yeah
Dirty, dirty, you're such a dirty girl yeah
Dirty, dirty, you're such a dirty girl yeah
Dirty, dirty, you're such a dirty girl yeah

[Verse 1: Slug]
Came to get an oil-change for my girlfriends car
But by the time I left I was short of breath and brokenhearted (there she was)
There she was, bent over a motor
Dirty cap with a pony tail that sat between her shoulders (beautiful)
With an oil streak that must have kissed your cheekbone
Thick and volumtuous I wish that we could be alone (I would love to)
I would love to, touch you, rub you
See whats covered up under that greasy blue jumpsuit (come on)
Standin there holding that drippin dipstick
With a firm grip, yet so delicate
And the way you took that orange oil rag and wiped it clean
It's guaranteed to get repeated in my dreams
You make me wild feels like puppy love
Got so lost in your smile when you asked me what the mileage was
And if I ever leaned how to change my own oil
Promise you this customer is gonna remain so loyal (dirty girl)

[Chorus: Slug]
Dirty, dirty, you're such a dirty girl yeah
Dirty, dirty, you're such a dirty girl yeah
Dirty, dirty, you're such a dirty girl yeah
Dirty, dirty, you're such a dirty girl yeah

[Verse 2: Murs]
Now there's this hamburger stand thirty minutes out of town
Used to go for the best veggie burgers around
That was until I met this brown guaranteed to astound
Short order chef eyes deeper than sound
She wore a dirty green apron like a silk nightgown
Them cappuccino fingernails wrote my order down
Three dots tattood between her thumb and her index
Twenty-four waste held the holster for the windex
Heat from the grill made her mascara drip
The sweat on her face showed the fuzz on her lip
Them work pants couldn't hide the love in them hips
Call it bad taste but this girl was the shit
It's the way that hair net kinda covered up her ear
Had me askin why the fuck she was even workin' here
But next time I get hungry I'ma drive to pasadina
'Cause I just gotta see her, me linda cocina

[Chorus: Slug]
Dirty, dirty, you're such a dirty girl yeah
Dirty, dirty, you're such a dirty girl yeah
Dirty, dirty, you're such a dirty girl yeah
Dirty, dirty, you're such a dirty girl yeah
Dirty, dirty, you're such a dirty girl yeah
Dirty, dirty, you're such a dirty girl yeah
