Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I be rollin
Riden
Flow so fly I be so so high
She say I'm that guy you wanna ride with
Like my car get inside it
You excited
I don't blame you
Everywhere I go all them hoes act the same too
I don't wanna date you
I just wanna take you home and do somethin grown folks can relate too
Bitch I'm a play you
I would hate to
But if you stay cool we should be straight boo
Bitch I'm a straight fool
No I can't lie
Don't let a day go bye where I ain't high
Pump your brake lights lemme slow it down
Know who I is and how is bout to go down
You wanna roll now
We'll just ride out
Right now I'll show you what I'm bout

[Chorus]
Tryna front when you see me in the club bitch you know who I am [x4]
Gettin weeded with a pocket full of dubs I bet you know who I am [x4]
They be runnin up and showin all this love cause they know who I am [x4]
Didn't notice it but now your goin nuts cause you know who I am [x4]

I be cakin
Makin all of this money
Look honey I ain't fakin
See that your takin
That's cool with me
Cause you and your boyfriend ain't got shit to do with me
Truthfully
Real talk
I pimp hard she tell them to get lost
Bottles of patron good green in my cigar
See you in your girl watchin me and my niggas
Now that your with us
If not wiz don't fuck a rap star
I just get it how I live
This ain't the first time that you heard about wiz
So ma why I feelin me just front and act like it is
You ain't the type of juice better then one poundin
Just lettin me come round now she a buss down
Feelin my convo
Then mami let's ride out
Right now I'll show you what I'm bout

[Chorus]</pre>
