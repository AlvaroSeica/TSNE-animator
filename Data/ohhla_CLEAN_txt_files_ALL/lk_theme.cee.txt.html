[Cee-Lo Green]
Well hello there!
My name is... not important
And I'm often asked, what do I do for a living?
And I answer, I do what I want
Spontaniety is, the spice of life
And I've indulged quite a bit
But, I'm not above the law
And I'm certainly not lawless
But when it comes to ladies...
I have a license, to kill

{*instrumental for 38 seconds followed by gunshot*}

Got her~! (ohhh)

Lady KILLERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRrrrrrrrrrrr...</pre>
