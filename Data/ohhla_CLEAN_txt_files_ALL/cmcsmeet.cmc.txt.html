[Chille Chill - Gospel Gangstas]
It's the invasion of the catsy chucks up out of the cut (??)
ready to rip it up, its Chille Chill the Gospel Nut
givin you what you want, givin you what you need
the truth, the funk, as I proceed
It's no need to smoke weed when I gotta get you high
Most High, reckon I, see as I
abide in the shadow of the you know
in my seranades go to to ya (??)

[Daddy Free]
F R double E, don't forget the Daddy
shot gun I spot 'em out of the window of a Chill's Caddy
I wonder if they know Jesus, if not I'm ready
to serve, I swerve, over to the curve
I hops out with the Good News
with peace shod on my shoes, givin Satan the blues
waitin for Tic, Giz, and Solo comin from Pamona
but homie who is that I see around the corner?

[Chorus]
hey Big Chill I think I see 2 G's
who is that?
oh, loc thats the CMC's
Hey Giz I think I see 3 G's
who is that?
oh, dog thats them O Double G's
hey Solo I think I see 2 G's
a who is that?
oh, homie thats them CMC's
hey Free I think I see 3 G's
who is that?
hey, loc its them O Double G's

[Gizmo]
out the blue, guess who steps on the scene
It's G I Z, CMC, now you know what I mean
with the Truth, a word from the Lord, and a servant's heart
servin marks, and the Shield of Faith for the fiery darts
I got my hat back, ready for the ratpack
on the devil in the ghetto, and the Double G's got my back
in fact, we got a bond that can never be broken
Tic, uh, they think I'm jokin

(Tik Tokk of the gospel gangstas)
well I'm loc'in, lets get to the nitty gritty
Jesus is my Saviour, and Compton is my city
CMC's my comrades, Satan is my enemy
O Double G's my brothers, everybodys ain't no friend of me
a lotta playa haters quick to think a chew slug at me (??)
but they don't know that Jesus love a little thug like me
but yet I hoola, this is how I do's a when I'm dunnin (??)
CMC's and O Double G's started runnin

[Chorus]
hey Giz I think I see 3 G's
who is that?
thats them O Double G's, uh
hey Tic I think I see 2 G's
who is that?
oh, loc it be the CMC's
hey Free I think I see 3 G's
whos that?
It's them O Double G's
hey Chill I think I see 2 G's
who is thizzat?
oh, loc thats the homies them CMC's

[Mr. Solo - Gospel Gangstas]
well then everybody creep, and every body hit they knees
they callin APBs because they dissed by the dapocca G's
hitting fences, jumping trenches, trying to cross waters
satans ready cause they headed for the lost quarters
trying to get they act right
but when Bloods and Crips is in the midst, they backbite
but you don't even know me
cause if you did then you would know I'm livin holy
cause I want to see Jesus, want a G thesis
It's khaki suits in church cause I ain't comfortable in three pieces
Don't want to hear no mo, just let me go
I came to praise Him with my soul, not with my clothes
so when you see me at the LQ, tell you
eyes to the skies, G's rise as I bells through, gangs

[Gizmo]
I thought you knew but now you know
about the CMC and Double G Connection
And we flexin, barbequin demons like a Texan, in my section
so son you better recognize and run for protection
cause there won't be no stoppin, and be no quittin
as long as God gives me breath and these beats keep hittin

[Chorus]
Tic Tic I think I see 2 G's
And who is that?
ah, homie thats the CMC's
hey Giz I think I see 3 G's
who is that?
thats them O Double G's, uh
hey Chill I think I see 2 G's
who is thizzat?
oh, homie thats the CMC's
hey Free I think I see 3 G's
whos that?
hey, loc, thats them O Double G's
hey Solo I think I see 2 G's
a who dat be?
oh, thats them CMC's
hey Giz I think I see 3 G's
whos that?
thats them O Double G's</pre>
