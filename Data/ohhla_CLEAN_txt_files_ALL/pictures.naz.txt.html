[Eulogy Clip]
Here, at this final hour, in this quiet place
Come to bid farewell to one of its brightest hopes
Extinguished now and gone from us forever

[Bronze Nazareth]
I tote the hammer when home
Like a modern Capone, I keep my hat low
Rollin up my dreams and then blow
Scoped by the feds now I'm edgy like the balance pole
Stretch him with the calico, saw his face was my nigga though!
Damn whats in the city air?
Sitting there next to a picture, at me it quietly stared
Delusional off the smoke fixture, that shit'll get ya
My Grand Daddy glared back like me in the mirror
Died of cancer, I never saw death's face much clearer
Watched him in the Commons, spitting up minutes
He had a cup, loved the pistons, writing this, my heart's skippin
Went from earth to heaven, sure as the moon'll glisten
Smoke arises from my lungs, in the present prison
It's like his picture sending me message to balance living
He got a grimace like he's ashamed in ways
His soul rose out the smoke clouds, I'm calm but amazed
Told him for one, I feel responsible for Illah Dayz
Shouldn't have let him leave, he trying to walk and breathe
Tears stream like the end of my Nile  never achieved
He said with stem cells we'll rock live with 14 feet
My children black royalty, Obama new King
Until that day my, frame'll hurt I'm walking for two
It's my honor, only God knows what follows monsoons
opened my eyes, smoke gone, blunt in the tray
heard his voice one time, told me to iron my wings
But when danger come, like World War 2, pop them thangs!!!!

[Eulogy Clip]
And it is, therefore, most fitting
that we meet once again
to share these last moments with him

[Bronze Nazareth]
I stash the heat when I move
Cause the sun don't shine, I keep my eyes low
Natural sunglass, pass the wine
Woke by the flashing lights in my mind so clear
that one shot produced a million piece broken mirror
Yo what's in the Florida air?
A cold stare from a photograph looked back as if he could hear
Outlandish off the green lanterns
Anger set in, as we declared out loud we heat handlers!
Romancing plans of blowing trees in deep mansions
My cousin glared back like he ain't understand it
Died a young king, Aunt Debbie with her face in her hands!
I saw the moon set, while dark clouds cried on withered plants
Blow tar from my lungs, while in my white owl trance
I swear I hear him talking, while the clouds dance
Saw his reflection in my chrome, his mouth was movin
And I aint turn around, like it was Malcolm  I listened
And then I said I miss him
I Feel guilty down here enjoying life, while you beyond the solar system
Tears stream and turn into steam on my Smith and Wesson
Said when I rock crown, he'll shine on me from heaven
My cousin blessed chemistry, a soldiers salute
Til then, my lungs'll both hurt, I'm breathing for two
Awoke to sun down, flashin lights, the wings of a plane
Heard his voice one time, told me to walk like a king
Sometime I'll stop by and we can talk in a dream

We shoulda kicked it, shoulda had more visits
We should kicked it, now your gone
Prophet Joshua Stone martyr to youth who left the glock home
Shoulda kicked it, shoulda had more visits

[Eulogy Clip]
This beleaguered, unfortunate but nonetheless proud community has found a
braver, more gallant young champion than this Afro-American who lies before
us, unconquered still</pre>
