[Intro]
*whisper* Move...
{Yeeaaaaaaaaah, Lil' Lody on the track~!}

[Chorus: Young Jeezy]
Whatchu know 'bout champagne er'ry night
Bad bitches er'rywhere - Barry White
Fifty things, I could bury white
Countin up a million dollars er'ry night
Hit the mall, blow a fo' way
Kinda hard when you sleepin on Dolce
Wake up, drinkin Ros√©
Killin that white bitch - OJ

[Young Jeezy]
Smokin that exotic, ridin that foreign
Million dollar round trippin, I ain't talkin 'bout tourin (Nah!)
Yeah, countin money 'til ya borin
Man, fuck that shit~! (Jizzle, where you goin?) Ha-haaaaah!
Flat screens on the wall, nigga IMAX
Michael Turners on deck, nigga +half backs+
Dirty white bitch, yeah that Katt Stacks
We don't sleep 'round here, we take cat naps
Wesley Snipes muh'fucker, this the +Money Train+
Swear the work came faster than the money came (Daaaamn!)
Sometimes the money be faster than the cars is
If the feds ain't watchin then them broads is
Could end anyday and you know better
Now you watch the Frito-Lay, yeah you know cheddar (Yeaaaaaaah!)
Double bags at the spot, luggage in the place
Louis V. on deck, luggage on my waist (YEAH!)

[Chorus]

[Fabolous]
I woke up sayin, "I ain't drinkin no mo'"
Same night in the spot drinkin Coco
Loso, bad bitch think she know so
Got her man-cuffin nigga, think he po-po
She tryna go below the belt, thinkin low blow
I'm thinkin "Oh yeah," he thinkin "Oh no"
I'm on my high horse, nigga thinkin Polo
Got the +9+ on me so I think I'm Romo
Uh, I'm about that life nigga
Bring you in the game, let you meet my wife nigga
Married to this shit, askin, "Am I gettin cheddar now?"
They say, "I do" like a muh'fuckin wedding vow (Nice~!)
That AirTran, we flyin for cheap
And you niggaz sleepin on me, hope you die in yo' sleep, haha!
OJ, yeah prol'ly don't get it
I'm the best that ever did it and got away with it, ah!

[Chorus]

[Jadakiss]
HA-HAAAAAAH~!
Yo, you could tell he gettin money and every nigga with 'em
The gloves don't fit him, so they gotta acquit him
Ain't nobody seen it, but everybody heard it
The whole town hatin, they waitin on a verdict
Tell 'em niggaz pop off, I'm waitin on a drop-off
And I ain't leavin the block 'til I knock the whole box off
Yeah, takin care of the whole fam
Bought the Porsche, gave the M to my old man
+Mo' Money Mo' problems+, more grams
More real estate, more land (yeah)
At fight night I be ringside, I let them things fly 
Just put 1.5 under my king size (Cash)
I look at the world thru a king's eyes
I was born to spit bars and sling pies
I ain't wealthy yet but I'm quite rich
I just gotta keep killin that white bitch

[Chorus]</pre>
