[Intro]
E'rybody get up!
Hey hey hey
Hey hey hey
Hey hey hey
Hey hey hey (woo!)

[Robin Thicke] (?uestlove)
Turn me up
If you can't hear, what I'm tryna say
If you can't read, from the same page
Maybe I'm goin deaf, maybe I'm goin blind 
Maybe I'm out of my miiiiiind (e'rybody get up!)

[Interlude: Jimmy Fallon and Robin Thicke] + (The Roots)
Okay now he was close, tried to domesticate ya
But you're an animal, baby it's in your nature
Just let me liberate ya (hey hey hey) you don't need no papers (hey hey hey)
That man is not your maker (hey hey hey) and that's why I'ma take a

[Chorus]
Good girl! I know you want it
I know you want it, I know you want it
You're a good girl! Can't let it get past me
You're far from plastic, talk about gettin blasted
I hate these blurred lines! I know you want it
I know you want it, I know you want it
But you're a good girl! The way you grab me
Must wanna get nasty, go 'head get at me (e'rybody get up)

[Robin Thicke] + (The Roots)
What do they make dreams for, when you got them jeans on
What do we need steam- hit it! (You're the hottest... in this place!)
I feel so lucky (hey hey hey) you wanna hug me (hey hey hey)
What rhymes with hug me? (Hey hey hey) Rub me! (e'rybody get up)

[Interlude] + [Chorus]

[Black Thought]
Good girlfirends, I had a few
But the best girlfriend I ever had was you
I thank God for my blessings, it began with you
So I put a ring on it and I married you
C'mon take a ride with me on the avenue
If you see it and you want it, you can have it, boo
You gon' have these other girls gettin mad at you
Cause you got, brains, looks and attitude combined
See the lines gettin blurrier
I come home to my own Miss America
I mean this ain't no ordinary love
Go an' bring it here to me girl, hurry up
And um, I'm watchin, I'm waitin
And they're not you, so they hatin
They just angry cause you ain't basic
And I'ma give you a standing ovation!!

[Chorus] w/ ad libs

[Outro]
Blurred liiiiiiiineeeeees!!!</pre>
