"Cause I never want to make you change"

[Rapper Big Pooh]
People keep askin me when Sleepers 2 coming out
I say never, thanks for lookin out
Don't you hear this music that I'm puttin out?
If I had to say so, say I'm gettin better, y'know?
I'm hotter than a sweater on a girl on the beach 
in the middle of the summer sippin bellinis peach
Me and D.R. had a talk, I asked him what I'm gon' do (Preach)
..It ain't like I went gold
Even LB barely did a hundred
..So let me find out 
all along that the old me is what you niggaz really wanted
I appreciate the compliment
But when you gonna appreciate accomplishments?
Eventually we all grow
So me goin forward shouldn't be no astonishment

[Chorus]
"Don't change, don't change" (Uh, they keep sayin, keep sayin)
"Don't change, don't change" (Yo, they keep sayin, keep sayin)
"Don't change, don't change" (Yo, they keep sayin, keep sayin)
"Don't change, don't change" "Everything the same"

[Rapper Big Pooh]
People keep askin me when LB comin back
I say we NOT, and this is fact
Why you clingin to the past?
I been moved on, blazin another path
While I'm flattered by the questionnaire
If that's the only reason that you came here
..Then you might as well go
This channel been changed, homie this another show
..I'm doing this for me now
...I'm curious to see how
many people still listening or givin him a fair shake -- remember him?
It was what it was
The music speaks, it does what it does
You fuckin with me or not
I appreciate your time, either way it's all love

[Chorus]</pre>
