[Intro: Celph Titled]
Yeah...muhfucka
It's Celph muthafuckin' Titled
M-o-t-i-v-e...Southpaw, what up baby?
Muthafuckin' Demigodz...muthafuckin' Doe Rakers
This how the fuck we get down
Yeah! Yo...

[Verse 1: Celph Titled]
You're muthafuckin' right I ain't dead yet, I'm back with a vengeance
Keep rappers on their toes every time I make an entrance
Who is it? Celph Titled and Motive: two soldiers from the 'godz with four-fifths
That'll throw your kids off the edge of a snow cliff
And fuck banana clips, I'm on some watermelon shit
You oughta call it quits, 'cause when the seeds spit every nigga gettin' hit
Come get me, ain't no alarm system, just grab your arms and rip 'em
Blood drippin', paint the Rubix Cuban emblem with 'em
A Spanish nigga that'll vanish niggas out their whole existence
Atheists want it with me, and then they go religious
I got bitches from your 'hood researchin' facts on you
Catch you at Mac-donalds and put the MAC on you
Blaat! Bomb you, and put that black bag on you
In the freezer, "Cold As Ice" like M.O.P.'s song do
So "What you want on your tombstone?" Ain't no pizza here
Fuck with Doe Rakers and you better keep them heaters near

[Chorus] (Repeat 3X)
"Wile out, fuck niggas up, laugh about it"
