[Trey Songz]
You know I have to be honest
It's like for the first time in my life
My pride is not a problem
I'm not afraid
I'm not afraid to tell you girl
That I love you
Believe that
And if I cant have you
I don't know what ima do
Listen to me

So many people never find the one
That's why I really wanna tell you somethin
I really think this is it for me
I really think you're the one I need
Cause baby I done had 'em all
I don't want nobody but you
Yeh, Oh darlin'

[Bridge]
Baby let me break it down
See, we livin in a lonely world
Aint you tired of the runnin 'round?
Don't you wanna be my only girl?
Baby can I be the one to call
When you're tired of the lies
And the truth is all you wanna hear
Only if you swear

[Chorus]
Baby, here I am (here I am)
I'm your man (I'm your man)
I came with everything you needed
You and me undefeated
Till the end of time
One mind, one heart, one love
All you gotta do is
Take my hand (take my hand)
We will stand (we will stand)
This was made to last forever
So lets say it together for the rest of time
One mind, one heart, one love

[Trey Songz]
Ohh, Listen baby
I'll give you all I'm worth
From my head down to my shoes
And girl if we gone work
Then I need the same from you
I know that so many other dudes cheat
But so many dudes aint me
Give me my pick of any dime
And I'll pick you girl every time

[Bridge]
I just wanna break it down
See, we livin in a lonely world
Aint you tired of the runnin 'round?
Don't you wanna be my only girl?
Baby can I be the one to call
When you're tired of the lies
And the truth is all you wanna hear
If you swear

[Chorus]

[Trey Songz]
Ohh, Love is hard to find
But love is one of a kind
And I got mind
So if you got yours
Then you know what your livin for
This goes out to all my lovers tonight
And if you listenin to my groove
And your baby's next to you
Tell 'em
'You are all I need and I'll never let go'
You are all I need and I'll never let go
(Never let go of you)

[Chorus]

[Trey Songz]
Ohh ohh ohh ohh, oh yeah
(You are all I need and I'll never let go)
Ohh, Love
Love, love
Tell 'em
You are all I need and I'll never let go (Let go)</pre>
