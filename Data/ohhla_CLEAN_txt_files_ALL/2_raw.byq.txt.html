[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah (uh)
Yeah, yeah... yeah!

[ScHoolboy Q]
Aye groove the window down oh shit I'm gettin hot
Still I'm cool; no AC needed
Probly slidin down your region, oh this Henny got me leanin
Ain't no secret that we ballin and yo hoe be refereein
Bet I make that pussy whistle up and down that booty dribble
Was she foul? Just a little, tech-nical how she nibble uhh
Ain't fuckin with you losers all my niggaz won
Mister Bet-I-Got-Some-Weed, Ace got another one
Look down upon the ceiling; just try to reach the sky
cause when you're up they all be kneeling
+Contradictions+ in my thoughts and I just execute my feelings
Shake the non-believers off, I'm tryin to navigate a million
But yo first let's hit the sto' you know I love Korean
She tell me hurry up and buy, I hurry up I'm fiendin
So-so-so I zip that, ch-ch-chhop that, pass the blunt
Know my dick from last month well there's more to come
What the fuck~?!

[Chorus]
Too, too fuckin raw (face down, ass up) {*4X*}
When the sunshine, and the moonlight
in my life - too fuckin raw (face down, ass up)
When the sunshine, and the moonlight
in my life - too fuckin raw (face down, ass up)

[ScHoolboy Q]
Heroin, extacy, oxycontin
Vicodins, Coca-Cola everything up in our jeans
Even methamphetamines, get this bread by any means
PCP, LSD, transactions frequently
Turn ya job into a ki', turn that ki' into a beach
and turn that beach into your sleep, rest your head remain neat
Haters love to hate a G, gossip on your bakery
Wish they had the recipe; swear this life was meant for me
I'm tired of crackin niggaz heads in a stolen Challenger
Hopped up out the passenger, and merked the D.A.'s messenger
Every corner camera; nigga I'm just tryin live
Shitty on a shitty curb, niggaz kill ya in front ya kids
See how niggaz get it in? Trappin so we live in sin
This felony won't keep me in; I'm hungry gotta rob again
Embarrassing my mom and them, grandma braggin to her friends
Killin beef apparently, name a nigga rare as me
Yeah I be, too fuckin raw

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

[Jay Rock]
Got me swagged, then I put yo' style in a body bag
Man I'm off a bag of that good, my flow off a powder pack
Man I'm leanin hard
Like I'm off that sy-rup, and I'm damn near to' up
With my dogs and locsters, and we all got stock like brokers
Uhh~! We don't chase hoes, nah; hoes gon chase us, yeah
Straight to the condo
Yeah bitches ain't shit that's the muh'fuckin motto
In the Monte Carlo, yeah sippin on Carlo
Just me and my posse
Strapped up when you gotta know the ropes like Ted DiBiase
Look at my life raw, NIGGA
Bitches wanna suck me off, QUICKER
Haters can't stand my guts, NIGGA
Cuz I get my bucks, BIGGER
I mind my own, I'm in my zone
Bitch niggaz can't knock me out my throne
I'm on my shit, cause sceptic tanks
I don't give a fuck what set you claim
Just get yo' money let the bullshit walk
I'ma get this cheese like a hoodrat bitch
Fuck and suck me good, then I run through her team
Raw shit, nigga check me out, know you jockin my steez
Best believe, nigga we run this shit
Niggas know that I be, be, be too fuckin raw

[Chorus]</pre>
