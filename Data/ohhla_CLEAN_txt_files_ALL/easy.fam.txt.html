[Molly-Q]
I'm on a new level learning tricks of the trade
Getting paid on close shaves, leaving graves to the raids
My blades a bone baking, making use of my semen
Truth's wisdom wake and bake of the menacing dreams
Fiends of sick thoughts, put you closer to the edge
Level I curse the others, and the thoughts is just dead
Could deal like a meal's well over cooked
Broke bread by the streets and the goose got cooked
I look back on the days for making diamond for a forty
Shorty picks from his pocket, we bounce out the profit
Chicks still get harassed by the magnum blue pigs
Run wit pigs, check my whips and see what I did
But now things change, no more rat race, run and rap away
While my tracks come up short --- stumbling
Stumbling over words, I curb in suburbs
Blurred vision is the future, got ya, on the third

[Crunch Lo]
Yo, walking out my building on some get money clout
I got my drills back, I'm bout to break another out
I see mad drama, try my best to avoid shit
Straight up CREAM if it means to extort shit
My project niggas got it set in they mind
To start the revolution, knock it off one time
And backstabbers, I need a shorty for tonight's matter
So what's the deal, are you ready for me culture steady?
That nigga Lo I be, most call me Crunch
Stay looking hazy, cuz I stay smoking blunts
And chill, just parlils with my mans
Try to front and you'll catch a stomp with them Timberlands
Understand it's something real going on
The crowd from your gats will be your body rotting theme song
Just a day in the life, you don't know what it could be bring
Stick to the rules of the game and never change
In these ghetto streets, it's hard to maintain

[Shawn Wigs]
What's the stats on these thugs peddling drugs
Recline with wine, on big baskets and rugs
Drugs on the table, with dooers white labels
Scotch on the rocks and bitches licking they navels
With hollowed out dutches, packed with the trees
From across seas, making cheese like it's a ease
Shining they gats and oo-wops in the cabin
Setting up plans, it's bay steady backstabbing
Looking like Italian mafia with suits and top hats
And underground casinos playing craps
Just to get the dough living life as it goes
Fine women are hoes, even Broadways shows
Forget the limos, '96 Cadillac
Limited Cherokees, BM's and phat Ac's
I know the steelo, cuz I watch it from a distance
But stay out the game cuz I got strong resistance</pre>
