[N-Tyce]
Yeah, yo, yo
Aight, shut up, time to listen to this
I'm bout to have ya'll hissin a fit
I'm hot like a tick in a flick
Change gears like a stick in the whip
My voice whines like a baby bitchin a fit
I guess the clock's tickin a bit
When I'm bored I walk down the street kicking a stick
Get with the chick, fittin the hit
Who the greatest female? I'm the chick ya'll fixin to pick
Underrated, underestimated
But I've been waiting my turn, I'm the next chick designated
It took a second for me to make it, but I'm here now
And I don't pop bottles, I guzzle beer down
Seein clear now, twenty twenty with my contacts
Got my ??? sleepin, a pen to write bomb tracks
Verbal combat, time to focus on the target
It's about to be riot if ???

[Chorus X2: N-Tyce]
Everybody hush, be quiet
I am getting wired, sick and tired
Of these folks who ain't got fired
Rock The World till I retire
We about to start I fire
Everybody Hush, be quiet

[N-Tyce]
Yeah, yo, this is what I live for
Stadium lights bright with my name on the billboard
And if you feelin this now, you won't feel more
I'm a rapper girl, what you wearing high heels for?
I ain't sayin you should thug it like a nigga do
I'm guilty of trying to plot to get rid of you
But not trying to cause physical harm
Then again it depends on what level I'm on
Write rhymes when instrumentals are on
But not too high tech, I keep it simple with songs
Tyce, I'm that chick that you wanna make your wifey
We can have kids and make a chick just like me
Hard headed, talk back to my elders
Folsk wanted me to grow up to be a failure
I take your money when I stack dice
Even though I flinked math twice

[Chorus]

[N-Tyce]
I learned in life you gotta gice and take
When I was just a lil Candy Girl rocking New Edition tapes
Now avenging papes, waving the cops
While I'm smiling, speeding down the interstate
I'm like the Roadrunner
Cuz when I zoom by with its, I make it last for the whole summer
And keep baking you and baking you, and feeding you
If you don't know why I Rock The World, then you need to
Folks talk, but they don't listen
Either that, or don't pay attention
You need to pick and choose
I'm sick of dudes, Just a Deadly Venoms chick trying to make a hit or two
