[Hook]
All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy
Occupying space through time
And we give you "The Rhyming"
Murdering mindlessness, lose consciousness 
Minds possessed, (name) wont hurt ya I'm just stressed

I stepped and stubbed so many toes I'm left with bruising feet
Confront the inner child inside about the losing streak (SE)
Ya'll should lose your teeth when you abuse the speech
I got endless epilogues with different stoops to preach
Ya crews is weak cant talk your way out but use tools to speak (SE)
No Artvoice its muffled voice channel 4 news is leaked
Into pores, entered Matrix and paused (SE)
Played Russian roulette with rifles and gods
Trifling odds to visualize the concept of paying Adelphia's cost
Deciphering the lines in my lime green bars
That scroll down, I'm whole now but two halves did split
My life ... but you don't know the half of it
Guessing like a half wit I'll tell you suck my dick (SE)
Like that old chick from that Lake Placid flick
Mastered this to the point where I can disappear and reappear like a magic trick
Imagine this, I'm Houdini surviving water tricks as a vocabulist
I'll take the insecure mind of a dime convert her to a catalyst
You wanna battle this at the bar?  trying to get drunk (SE)
So I'll let you spit your verse and feel you made me a chump
But when the cd gets released 
You'll realize that me and Aston Kutcher got you punked
I'm trying to let you work out your throat with a knot lump
Make you feel like Private Pile from soap on the top bunk</pre>
