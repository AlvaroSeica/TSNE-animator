[Chorus]
They don't know how far back that we go (we go)
From riding skates, to riding 24's
From off the block husttlin to rockin shows
we done seen many bumps in the road
But still we remain, still in the game
Never worry, about them haters, that will never change
And I put this on everything babe
I am my brother's keeper

[Kaine]
Listen D-Roc, I know you don't think I care for ya
but at a drop of a dime I'll be there for ya
and anybody want to see us apart
we need to get rid ofthey ass man and thats from the heart
Pick 'em apart now that the ying yang twins got some ends
we seem to have plenty of friends
excuse me then friend, let me borrow a stack
and when tomorrow comes don't ask me to borrow it back
If they cant do that they don't contribute to the answer
? ? from the ? serious as cancer
If I was JoJo dancer I would do the same thang
not to let another man spark my flame
D-Roc is the ying, Kaine is the yang
but withoutthe both of us we ain't got a damn thang
Its me and my brother, my brother and me
all that you see on TV

[Chorus]

[D-Roc]
United states of Atlanta its still me and my brother
we done been through a lot but still kain I love ya
blood, sweat, and tears, good days and bad
from the time you make me laugh you made me mad
I still got cha back but I'ma take ya way back
when we was sufferin just to get a nickle sack
scraping up change trying to make 2 dollars or 3
to get some 99 cent hamburgers to eat
and then ride thorough atlanta in yo raggedy car
back then we was some underground superstars
and these last 5 years we done put work in
now the whole world know of the ying yang twins
Even though we don't spend time at home together
we hit the road and its like we never left each other
Now thats love. I love you til the day that I leave
so its still my brother and me

[Chorus]

[Kaine and D-Roc]
People of the world we must change our mind frame
and stay away from the con and mind games
Its hard to maintain and stay sane at the same time
steady working hard but you barely gettin by
trying to make a line between stress and peace
and Satan always gettin the best of me
my closest of kin, my best friend
man we all in the struggle but you gotta remember I'm yo brother
Listen people you need to start helping yo brother
helping yo sister, mama, daddy, children and all
Dont leave these babies out here all alone
they don't know whats going on
They don't know right from wrong
so when you see yo brother give him a hug
and a shoulder to lean on and don't leave him out here on his own
cause times gettin hard these days
We at war amongest ourselves and we at war overseas brother

[Chorus]</pre>
