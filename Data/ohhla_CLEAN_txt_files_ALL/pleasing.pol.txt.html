[Half Chorus - Jasper]                 
Pleasing you ain't easy, 
But it pleases me to see you happy 
I'll tear down the sky, I'll sacrifice
So long as you will have me
  
[Dirt Gritie]     
In many different ways on any given day 
You know that you got me to take away the pain 
And help carry the loud
I could raise your chi when your energy's low, listen girl
What it is that you already know? 
It's like a secret and you keep it though everyone knows (Its love)
And will I keep it yo it's hard to say no
Like when you sleeping and they asking is you sleeping yo?
I'm wide awake to what it takes to be yours 
And if I stray then you say hey and I get back on course
I'm waiting in the hail I'm waiting in the rain 
I'm waiting in the snow but am I waiting in vain 
  
[Chorus 1X - Jasper]                       
Pleasing you ain't easy
But it pleases me to see you happy 
I'll tear down the sky, I'll sacrifice
So long as you will have me
Baby don't you know, I think you know
What you should know 
Is that you've always (always), always (always)
Always (always), always had me
  
[Dirt Gritie]
You, you, you got me mind soul and body
You could be my Whitney I could be your Bobby 
Better yet Will and Jada my fathers the Darth Vader 
I pull out my light sabre make your body feel tasered
Love or fear baby which is truly greater 
I love it when you are with me and fear it when I ain't near yah
To separate that would be hard on me 
But probably we should part if we can't agree to disagree then arguably 
We are headed to a state where you're no longer a part of me 
I gave you my heart what you want all of my arteries
Why you gotta go and make everything hard on me 
When I just want a make you happy 
  
[Chorus 1X - Jasper]                       
Pleasing you ain't easy
But it pleases me to see you happy 
I'll tear down the sky, I'll sacrifice
So long as you will have me
Baby don't you know, I think you know
What you should know 
Is that you've always (always), always (always)
Always (always), always had me
  
[Arlo Maverick]
No matter what I do, it never seems enough
But when I say it's over you call my bluff
No I, would never leave, but you got me confused
To win your heart baby girl my dignity I must lose
Are these merely hoops, for you to test my love
And if that's true, how many more do I jump
My friends said I should leave you, but we both know that I need you
But if you can't be pleased, why am I tryn'a please you
Why am I asking for advice on us?
Why do I feel like I'm the only one who fights for us?
Why have you changed your Facebook relationship status?
If we'll always be together I don't see why it matters
  
[Chorus 1X - Jasper]                       
Pleasing you ain't easy 
But it pleases me to see you happy 
I'll tear down the sky, I'll sacrifice
So long as you will have me
Baby don't you know, I think you know
What you should know 
Is that you've always (always), always (always)
Always (always), always had me</pre>
