(12 o'klok)
All I saw was the flames from the calico
I want to bust the skull in his head but fuck it I had to go
So many years up in the game, I thought this bitch was real
Look in his eyes, saw through the lies, that's when his shit was peeled
Fucked up the deal, I had to off him send him out of space
Said a prayer over the puddle of blood that used to be his face
Who was to care, watch that nigga die till he could die no mo
Fuck me up inside, the feelings wouldn't let me cry for show
I heard the twisted sounds of sirens on my fucking block
I guess its time I get this double barrel pumped and cocked
Know niggas must drop 
Let off a shot, I heard a tire screech
I tried to bail, so close to hell I felt the fire reaching
Running through the doorway, found some niggas to hide me through the daylight 
Hated to put them up in my business, fuck it, it might mean they life 
Them niggas ask me why I offed him so I had to tell him
That nigga wanted to play some fuck shit but I wanted to help him
I gave him close to thirty gee's told him bring his patna, get yo ass to texas
Two birds gon be up in a bravada, make sure you inspect them
Come back, I'ma give your fourty percent just to help yo ass out
But if you smell some fuck shit, then nigga you mash
All the while that nigga thought he was fucking me
Expecting sixty four oz's, he gots a quarter key
Wonder where my shit be, he tell me back in Houston
I'm looking for some answers, all he gave me was excuses
First it was a carjack, then it was the coppers so he had the ditch it
Then it was the bitches, plenty stories but they all twisted
Fuck it anger made me react before I knew it
His fucking head was on them tracks black dripping fluid

(Chorus: 12 o'klok)
It's gonna be a lotta slow singing and flower bringing
Fuck it, I'm in this shameless game
It's gonna be a lotta slow singing and flower bringing
I come to bring the pain in this shameless game
It's gonna be a lotta slow singing and flower bringing
How can I refrain from this shameless game
It's gonna be a lotta slow singing and flower bringing
How I maintain

(12 o'klok)
A couple of days later, I'm wanted, they saw me from the building
Ain't going to prison even if means somebody children
Let me catch the bitch that said my name, I got some drama for him 
And just my luck, that nigga fuck us all the time was knowing
Gave up some presidents to get his residence and catch him
Word out the p, they got his back and they gon try to protect him
I gots to catch him cause the cell is hell and in the cell ain't no living wealthy
All you got is memories to tell, that shit that ain't healthy 
In the middle of the night I creep
Catch him in his sleep, I'm through his window
Bout to bring some solitude through his temple, peep
Saw that nigga twisting turning in darkness he got me crazy
I remember the day I lost it, I heard his baby
Hiding from the next room, somebody move, it was his bitch
Looking me straight up in my shit, eyes wide
Told her shake the nigga, wake the nigga, seconds later he face the trigga
Fuck the fasad, its time to paint a picture
Bitch was on the side wining and weeping, too later to cry
Might as well get used to some permanent sleep cause you waiting to die 
Door slung open it was a little kid, a little shot he hit the floor 
Before I could realize the fuckers dead, I was busting a couple of times more
Three heads leaking the feds creeping I can hear them outside 
The sound of choppers, this could very well be the night that I die 
I rather fry before I let them enter 
I heard somebody on the loud speaker screaming surrender 
Nigga was fucked up from the dome a long way from home
No way to get out the beef from there 
Call all my niggas on the bitches phone, might not never see the streets again 
Tell them get here, creep up nigga, let yo bullets disperse
And if we die tonight they going first 
Holla at me my nigga

(Chorus)
It's gonna be a lotta slow singing and flower bringing
Fuck it, I'm in this shameless game
It's gonna be a lotta slow singing and flower bringing
I come to bring the pain in this shameless game
It's gonna be a lotta slow singing and flower bringing
How can I refrain from this shameless game
It's gonna be a lotta slow singing and flower bringing
How I maintain
 
(12 o'klok)
Screaming surrender I say never bust through the window
Got guts falling from sweaters, tag-teaming with twin berettas ready for whatever 
Fuck it, my life is an illusion anyway
I realize that through the mist of this confusion, I can die anyday
No need to cry I gots to be free
Even if means blasting you just to save me
Do what I have to do daily 
Fuck all the cussing and fussing I'm strictly bussing
Go the PD on tv watching this shit get heated like ovens
Ain't nothing gon bring back into the world that I came from
Ain't scared of death, in fact I'm kind of waiting to see the day come 
They run, I laugh looking through this window with shattered glass 
Coppers all over trying to scatter fast from the aftermath
Stepping over them bitches in a flurry, tell my niggas hurry
Either we gon ride or get buried 
Pick a later time to worry 
Already got 3 dead niggas in front of me
System ain't running me
I'm giving them all what they come to see
Mind full of madness
Only other alternative than doing time is in a casket
If I get blasted
Closing my eyes, I heard the door pop, beretta still cocked
It was foo telling the crew black they don killed klok
Carletta ran over to my side, eyes open wide
Saw I was bleeding but couldn't tell from where the blood was releasing
But its time to ride, lifting me up, drug me outside 
Through the back basement, right there where the navigator was waiting 
We blazing, abdomen getting swole, feeling like flames
I need some of that beige shit to stop my fucking pain
In my brain the pictures getting blurried
Streets don got a nigga sick
I'm guessing that can be the only thing that kill me my nigga</pre>
