Hey baby, ahh yeaaah 
Girl don't play no games, (what is ya talking bout) 
I'm trying to do something tonight girl, (if you ain't then I'm walking out) 
  
[Hook: Jack Freeman] 
Girl don't play no games, (what is ya talking bout) 
I'm trying to do something tonight girl, (if you ain't then I'm walking out) 
Let me know right now, (what is ya talking bout) 
I'm trying to do something tonight girl, (if you ain't then I'm walking out) 
  
[Lil' O] 
Ay, I ain't got time for games 
To tell the truth, I barely got time for ya name 
The only thing I got time for, is dough 
So if you ain't trying to fuck, girl it's time to go 
See baby girl, a real playa time is precious 
Her mouth moving, but my eyes on her breast'es 
See I ain't trying to hear what ya saying 
And I hope you ain't coime here, for no playing 
See boo I got this Rosay, I got this good tree 
And you just sipping chilling, smoking all my good weed 
Now I done took ya out to eat, that's my good deed 
Now it's time you treat a playa, I got hood needs 
So at the end of the night, and we feeling super right 
Baby girl I need to know, what we doing 
I'm trying to Robert Earl the pussy, Screw tape tap-tap 
Chop it up lil' mama is we screwing, I'm just saying man

Girl what are ya talking bout, what are you saying 
You need to stop teasing me, girl you sound like you playing 
My dick don't get no harder than this, here feel 
Oooh now that's for real, I can get you high or you can chill 
Just let me know, before I go out my way 
And spend all my money, and my time the whole day 
On nothing, and I wanna be nutting 
And you sitting there, talking bout nothing 
Fronting and shit, when you could be humping on this dick 
Come on girl, I know that you would be loving it 
Hugging it rubbing it sucking it, if you will 
That would work for me, come on girl what's the deal 
I'm fin to slide right through, give me a few 
Minutes to get there, don't concentrate on ya hair too much 
Cause I'ma fuck all that up, right quick 
But you gon' get some good diiiiiick

[Big K.R.I.T.] 
Is you sucking is you fucking, I was wondering I'm just saying 
We can quit with all that chatter, and you can let me get to banging 
On your backside let me get that act right, I know you know the sco' 
G-g-g-get down on the flo', w-w-w-work like a pro 
Do for me what you wouldn't do for ya man, let a real nigga beat ya out 
Send you home pussy so' and all, but let that fuck nigga eat ya out 
Chicken I couldn't be about it, if ya selling that then that's all fine 
Some niggaz in here that'll pay for it, but not me I can't spend a dime 
Best I can do is beat ya out, set ya out let ya shine 
The world to see P-I-M-P, but pardon me if I waste ya time 
Pardon me if I saw potential, thought ya had the fundamentals 
To be a certified money making pro, but on the low you a gold digger 
I can be it though don't be all in my face, searching for no figga fo' 
Yours locked you need yo bed rocked, trying to see what your head bout 
I'm just saying, I ain't never been the type for all those childish games 
You in the wrong V.I.P. section, perhaps you kicking it with some lames
