[Intro]
Born in the flood, bloody fingerpaint sets
Black marketed, fresh water cannons forget me not
Epitaph airbrushed with death
White tees, wife beaters, button up
Reattach flesh~!

[Verse One]
In between the lines
Outside of the law
Underneath the veil
We dig our foundations
We navigate the globe
Trying to find a pattern to break the mold
With a family to feed
There's nowhere we won't go

{*whispered*}
But what if were caught
They say I'm a snitch
Shot at the checkpoint
Found with his throat slit

{*normal volume gradually returns*}
There's spray paint on the teleprompter
Anchorman screams that he's seen a monster (mayday)
There's bloodstains on his shirt (mayday)
They say that he's gone bezerk!

[Verse Two]
Sometimes when I wanna shut out this world
Want to rip up this page
Want to pour out this heart
Want to get up on this stage
And my lips become percussion
And my fists become the rage
And I pound on this table
'til it gives me something to say
Then I think about things that I've seen
Right in front of me that I don't wanna believe
Gimme one of these mics
Let me let 'em know.. the way that
it is, is not how it's gonna be
Not if we don't let 'em get ahead of us
The present tension's no threat
It's just a fence across the path
that, we're already ready to walk
Rock solid, footsteps
Let 'em put up obstacles
And prove that it isn't possible
{Fuck} that! We don't give in anyway
True liberty and freedom's at stake
Peace will never become passe
Live my life until my last day
It was half-past eight in the Bat Cave
When the cracks in the plaster
Collapsed, and gave way to gaps in the pavement
(MAYDAY, MAYDAY) Put it on blast
For the passengers and messengers
Cause this is a disaster
Where the {fuck} are the rescue workers?
Not far, off pissin on a cop car
In the hall with aPpop Tart
Sippin liquor in the roc kbar
Everyone climb to the frontline, lunchtime's cancelled
All hands on deck to pull survivors from the landfill
Onlookers passers-by, brush off your shoulders
Shake off that rubble, break free from your standstill

[Chorus One]
Signs of a better world, causes we understand
Failures we expected to occur and bring redemption for our sins
Safety from the crowds
In the shadows on the run, we write our own Cider House
Rules to keep alive
Rituals that prove their worth
Search for systems we can trust
Rhythms we can lock into

[Verse Three]
This is madness, salvage teams can't bandage
Hope when it's damaged or broken compassion
There's not enough rope in the van
when the world is collapsin, our mode of action
Broadcast through the glass, all we can manage
Donate with the plastic scrapped from the salad
Hopin to balance, emotions invalidated
Staged on 4:3 aspects
Just ballast for sadness
Lives, shattered are standard fare for
cameras and channels stare no, abracabras
No faster answers or mantras for disasters
Remastered or plastered
We got it all backwards
Do you know the faction you're backin?
It's another man down, another mother gone
Child drowned, another silent song
Solitude, another kind of strong
I miss you, another strung along
Missing in action
Another page is blackend
Burned turned, to ashes to ashes
Dust off the flags and the caskets

[Chorus Two]
We will never find another you
Despite the life of love we knew
These lightning times are trouble who
can count the strikes that punish through
The bonds we thought, would never break
And never will, and never change
And never fade, but there's the rage
OF LOSING YOU TO THEIR MISTAKES~!

[Verse Four]
In between the lines - signs of the next movement
Refuge from the crowd - outside of the law
Causes we understand - hands that trace
instructions for descendants in the
Shadows on the run - underneath the veil
Failures we expected to occur
and bring redemption for our sins
In between the lines - in between the lines

[Outro - singers coming in at 3:59]
In between the lines, outside of the law
Underneath the veil...
In between the lines, outside of the law
Underneath the veil...
In between the lines, outside of the law
Underneath the veil, record our conditions
In between the lines, outside of the law
In between the lines</pre>
