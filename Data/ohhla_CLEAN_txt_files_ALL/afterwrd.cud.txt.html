Sexy, sexy

Gonna have us a good time and I ain't gonna lie
Got some friends around and we could slide by
Gonna have us a good time and I ain't gonna lie
We got some friends around, we got some friends around

Gonna have us a good time and I ain't gonna lie
Got some friends around and we could slide by
Gonna have us a good time and I ain't gonna lie
We got some friends around, we got some friends around

Yeah, let that bounce
We got you
Wicked!

We should go to my home, afterwards, come on
Bring yo friends; we should go to my home, afterwards, come on
We should go to my home, afterwards, come on
Bring yo friends; we should go to my home, afterwards, come on

Bring yo friends
Bring yo friends
Bring yo friends

We on, 'cross the globe
Don't box me in, claustrophobic
Tonight we alive, we should give 'em a show
And my living room dance-floor is ready to go

Tell my people, we on, 'cross the globe
Don't box me in, claustrophobic
Tonight we alive, we should give 'em a show
And my living room dance-floor is ready to go

Bring yo friends (Ready to go, ready to go)
Bring yo friends (Ready to go, ready to go)

We should go to my home, afterwards, come on
Bring yo friends; we should go to my home, afterwards, come on
We should go to my home, afterwards, come on
Bring yo friends; we should go to my home, afterwards, come on
We should go to my home, afterwards, come on
Bring yo friends; we should go to my home, afterwards, come on

Bring yo friends..

Oh, gonna show you how to do this dance

Just bounce, no hands
Gonna show you how to do this dance

Come rage with me
So right, so right, so nice
Come rage with me</pre>
