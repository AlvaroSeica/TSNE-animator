[Intro]
Do your hands so
Do your hands so, just do your hands so
And wash it up, do your hands so (whew, somebody smell rank)
Do your hands so, just do your hands so
Say wash it up, just do your hands so (put some cologne on)
Do your hands so, yes no means no (ease up man)
Just wash it up, just do your hands so (need a shower)
Do your hands so, just do your hands so

[Mr. Lif]
You call a lady over with a beautiful grill
You go to give her a kiss and yo she breath smell ill
Chill! That was my natural thought
I'm distraught, but goin for the gold is what I was taught
So I kiss she pon she neck and then I caress she breast
Lower body feelin stressed, we gettin undressed
And she gettin on so lookin fine and grindin
Scratchin, cryin, bitin, whinin
Kiss she pon she belly then I get by she navel
All the sudden notice somethin smellin unstable
Wait! What is that, fishbait?
Unsanitary state ruinin this date
Then I pause for a second and the dils went {*drooping whistle*}
Frustration from a foul sensation
Hey baby, did you ever think of bathin?
Maybe next time before you give an invitation

[Chorus One]
Wash it up! A little water and soap
And come along smellin fresh, that would be dope
Wash it up! Before you make me flee
You're smellin like old cheese, set me free
Wash it up! I'm just talkin that real
Don't want the {pussy} if the {pussy} smell stale
Wash it up! Before you make me cry
You look good, smell bad, girl bye-bye

[Mr. Lif]
I'm tourin in your city of my lady of choice
She 'bout to come to the show, she love the sound of my voice
And I'm on stage workin my set real hard
She's in the crowd lookin like she sayin "Oh God"
Sweat pon she forehead, eyes squint low
I hop off the stage and she said "Let's go
Lord, it's so hard for me to maintain
Whenever you're performin boy you drive me insane
Control me like you control the crowd"
I'm too hot and sweaty girl, I said not now
Pushed me in the bathroom and locked the door
She cryin for an encore, she wants some more
Put her thing against me and started to grind
Now I guess you know it's just a matter of time
You want it? You got it? Well here it comes
I'm deep in the {pussy} to the sound of the drums
Skirt pon she back with she hands pon the door
Shoes pon she feet with she bra pon the floor
Tellin me "I love it when you're sweaty and hot
Now give it to me rough boy whether or not, you"

[Chorus Two]
Wash it up! You just look so fine
I need to feel your body and me can't waste time
Wash it up! Or just save it for later
Let me taste ya, you're my favorite flavor
Wash it up! Boy you got my knees shakin
Back achin, you amazin Bajan
Wash it up! Well you can wash me too
But not until we're done boy whenever we're through

[Mr. Lif]
Mmm, sometimes you're good to go and sometimes no means no
You know the hand signal for no?
Let me break it down for you

Just wash it up, just do your hands so (whew)
Do your hands so, just do your hands so
And wash it up, now ladies do your hands so (Lord)
Do your hands so, just do your hands so (take a bath nigga)
Fellas wash it up, now fellas do your hands so (smell awful)
Do your hands so (Lord) just do your hands so
Tell her wash it up, and just do your hands so (somebody rank!)
Do your hands so, do your hands so
Wanna wash it up (whew!)</pre>
