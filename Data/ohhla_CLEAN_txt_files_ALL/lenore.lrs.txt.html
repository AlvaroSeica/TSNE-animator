Artist: MC Lars
Album:  Edgar Allan Poe EP
Song:   Lenore (I Miss You)
Typed by: @mc_lars (Horris Records)

Teenage bride with that honey inside
Lenore on all fours, so I went for a ride
Then she died  so now I'm getting lifted
Lost in the scotch but please don't get it twisted
See my Mom died when I was just baby
and I haven't really trusted any ladies at all maybe
We really don't connect, what do you expect?
Nervous, don't deserve this so I keep 'em all in check
I'm an East Coast player, pimpin' every day
But these women always die on me, I wish that they could stay
Never give your heart away  that's the G code
She left me all alone, MC Edgar Allan Poe
We know I get emo when I meditate on death
And decay and depression well some might say I'm obsessed
Got a bolder on my shoulders feels like everything is wrong
But this poetry is therapy and so I soldier on

[Chorus]
Lenore I miss you
That is not the issue
Wish that I could kiss you
And I'm really pissed you

Had to go away
I think about you every day
I'm clutching onto nothing babe
And no I'm not okay

Yes she was my cousin, it's a long story
But people point and stare, taking inventory
Of all the reasons why I'm such a creep
I know she was young (how young?) 13
But. Um  we really got along
I took her to the park, wrote her poems and songs
So how could it be wrong when it felt so right?
L-O-L, I-T-A in my arms every night
I'm a gangster yo thought I'd let you know
That I'm on that lean and I'm on that dro
And it's apropros feeling like Van Gogh
You could Say Anything, that boy's got woe
And who's that bro in my picture show?
John Cusak  who? Yo you really got to go
'Cause I might just go write some weird dark prose
I don't love you hos so I'm out the do'

[Repeat Chorus]

This is not a love song, I've never been in love
I've been with many women but I haven't found the one
Who really had my back when I was out on the streets
Saving up the money to master this EP
See  we artists are a very special breed
with very special paths and very special needs
I'd rather die alone than ever have to be
stuck forever after living so unhappily

[Repeat Chorus]</pre>
