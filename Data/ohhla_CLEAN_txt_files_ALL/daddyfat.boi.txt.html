[Big Boi]
It is I, the B-I-G, the B-O-I
Me oh my, ears to the street and eyes to the sky
Kept my sights on the prize, wide open, door wide
like the thighs of a hooker spread, told the girl bye
I got bigger fish to fry, niggaz wish I would retire
Cause of the pressure I apply every time I bust a rhyme
None of the rest of ya are tryin, watch me stimulate the minds of the masses
while you niggaz kickin it like jackasses
And who you votin for, Republican or Democratic?
Don't say it doesn't matter cause that's how they stole the last one
Assassin's bullet might be waitin for Obama
Do you think they'll have a brother before Billy's baby mama?
C'mon!

[Chorus: scratches by DJ Cutmaster Swiff]
"Look at the way you look at me" - "Da-Daddy Fat Sax"
"In my Cadillac, six woofers and fo' amps"
"Look at the way you look at me" - "Da-Daddy Fat Sax"
"In my Cadillac, six woofers and fo' amps"
"Look at the way you look at me" - "Daddy Fat-Fat Sax"
"In my Cadillac, six woofers and fo' amps"
"Look at the way you look at me" - "Da-Da-Daddy Fat Sax"
"In my Cadillac, six woofers and fo' amps"

[Big Boi]
My daddy told me it was mine for the takin
A true gift from God, the stars aligned when they made me
Him and Rena's baby, their first born son
I'm Antwan Andr√© Patton, the only one
Bloodline of a champion with heart of the lion
I'm defyin all the laws like a caterpillar flyin
Way before my time and reside in the Dirty Dirty
where they still hangin nooses like we in the early '30s
Goddamn, you know who I am? {"Da-Daddy Fat Sax"}
Royal fam of Atlanta, Dungeon bitch you understand? (boy!)
This ain't what you want, let's be clear from the bungie
I write knockout songs, you spit punchlines for money

[Chorus]

[Big Boi]
With my ears to the streets and my eyes to the sky
I'm on another planet my nigga and you just fly
(Why?) Cause I'm {"Da-Da-Daddy Fat Sax"}
Take that motherfucker, take that!
With my ears to the streets and my eyes to the sky
I'm on another planet my nigga and you just fly
(Why? Cause he's Daddy Fat Sax)
Ridin off in the Cadillac like that nigga

[Chorus]

[Big Boi]
Yea {"Da-Da-Daddy Fat Sax"}
What his name is? {"Da-Da-Daddy Fat Sax"}
What ya talkin 'bout? {"Da-Da-Daddy Fat Sax"}
Boy stop!</pre>
