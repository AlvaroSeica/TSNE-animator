[Keith David]
The threat to the world is not over
As we speak, our future is in great danger
Ice Cube, Mack 10 and W.C. are... MASTERS OF GANGSTERIZM!!
A group of organized street thugs turned buisness men
The Gangster, The Killa, and the Dope Dealer!
Through out the western hemisphere 
Connection cells had been multiplying faster then anticipated!
World domnination is a true reality we must face, 
it is...upon us.
Now, it's time to define some expressions!!
Capitalism, Materialism, and Imperialism
Our world must never fall in the hands of the WESTSIDE CONNECTION.
So what the fuck we gon do now?
What the fuck are we gonna do now?
