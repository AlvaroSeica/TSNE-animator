[Verse 1]
Why'd you call me so late tonight
Let me guess: somebody else
Has broken your heart, right?
I don't wanna hear that shit
If you think I do
You must be out of your mind, bitch

[Chorus]
But I try to be nice
Really wish you'd leave me alone
Stop asking me for advice
Why you gotta put me in the friend zone

[Verse 2]
What the fuck do I look like
What'd I ever do to make
You think this was all right?
I'm not one of your girlfriends
Not your BFF
So what the fuck is you thinkin'?
I don't wanna hear that shit
If you think I do
You must be out of your mind, bitch

[Chorus]
But I try to be nice
Really wish you'd leave me alone
Stop asking me for advice
Why you gotta keep me in the friend zone

[Verse 3]
Trust me, I secretly hate you
Ev'ry time you call to whine
About what you've been through
No dude wants to be THAT dude
So I'm not the only one
The fuck you expect, boo?
I don't wanna hear that shit
If you think I do
You must be out of your mind, bitch

[Chorus]
But I try to be nice
Really wish you'd leave me alone
Stop asking me for advice
Why you had to put me in the friend zone

[Verse 4]
Yeah, I know it sounds kinda harsh don't it?
Cryin' on my shoulder, you know I won't condone it
My plan initially was ascertain your flaws
And eventually I'd get inside them draws, aww
Pretended to befriend you, so maybe the fault's mine
I hope it isn't late enough to make up for lost time
I'm on to the next, and
If we ain't sexin'
You can miss me with that late-night textin'
I got my own life and the shit here is cumbersome
Tellin' me you gave the booty up to some other bum
Multiple times, and now it's obvious that he's tryin' to duck ya
Do I look like Dr. Phil, motherfucker?
I don't give a fuck, if you ask me, it serves you right
How would you like I called you all hours of the night
Boo-hooin' 'cause some cold-blooded floozie
Broke my fucking heart and how the hooker bamboozled me
Oh wait that's you
99% of men just want a cuddlebum
And let me tell you somethin' babycakes: I AM ONE OF THEM
So next time you toss around the va-jay-jay
And get hurt, go tell some sucka nigga that's gay, hey!

[Outro]
Not that there's anything wrong with being gay
I'm just saying
I mean, you got me re-evaluatin' MYSELF
On some "Man In The Mirror" shit, fucking Michael Jackson shit
Like "Where the hell did *I* slip up in my life, as a man
And make her think this shit was acceptable?"
Damn
Y'all should know better anyway
I AM A DUDE
I don't want to hear about who you're smashin'
I WANT TO SMASH
I mean we can be friends, don't get it twisted
The friend zone ain't the most comfortable of places, but it's livable
But when you start callin' me about Ray Ray and 'em
And how you met him and fucked him the same night
And now he won't answer your calls and "woe-is-me, I wanna kill myself"
Fuck, I don't wanna hear that shit
Go tell someone else, go tell Blu or one of them lovey-dove niggas
Tell ya dad or somethin'
If he's still around, no shots
