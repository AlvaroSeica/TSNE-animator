[Intro]
Man I heard that nigga Ray J got ten million off a BITCH!
Then less than three, off a deal?
Shit, add that all up, that's 13 million!

[Chorus: Ray J] + (Game)
Where you at? (I got it) Where you at? (I got it)
Where you at? (I got it) All my niggaz makin money
Where you at? {Where you at?} Where you at? {Where you at?}
Where you at? {Where you at?} All my bitches makin money where you at?
{"In my cherry red shirt, and my Anaheim fitted"}
{"In my cherry red shirt, and my Anaheim fitted"}
{"In my cherry red shirt, and my Anaheim fitted"}
{"Nigga throwin up the beat, baby can you get wit it?"}

[Ray J]
Soon as I got a mil', uh, I got a zone
Got a couple cribs, and, all brand new homes
Smokin and poppin pills, that's how it goin
In my cherry red shirt, in the club gettin loaded
Bitch I'm a baller (Ray J) but I ain't hoopin
I'm off the courts, in a view swoopin
And you can confirm THAT (with the whole West Coast)
Cause my nigga DJ Quik brought this beat funk music

[Chorus]

[Game]
I'm in cherry red Chucks, Anaheim fitted
Brim low, drive by, tell 'em Anaheim did it
Game the banger, part-time slanger
Half-time hustler, put soap on a hangar
Let it damp out, khaki suit flamin like the camp out
Game on a track I'll blow the fuckin amps out
Gangbang while I drive, pullin six tramps out
X Games in the hood, bring the fuckin ramps out (where you at?)
D-boys on the block, 'til they see the vans out
Three dollar X pills, call that shit a handout
She know that sex sells so she got her ass out
But we ain't buyin nothin but Patr√≥n bitch pass out (where you at?)
Where I'm at? In the hood on D's
Five years after I was in the hood on ki's
Rockin the A's hat, like where the haze at?
Red rag in my right pocket and I stay strapped

[Chorus] - 2X</pre>
