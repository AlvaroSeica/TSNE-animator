[Earl Sweatshirt]
We come through moppin, like janitors
Smokin kush nuggets the size of fuckin tarantulas
Blow got me amped as fuck, hoe niggaz backin up
And that nigga Short tell that nigga Jasper swag me up
Swag me up, swag is us, who can tell me how the fuck
our number one fans is faggots that used to laugh at us
Tell me who rad as us, huh, and the answer was
"Um, y'all dope, Wolf Gang just the damper dust"
Yeah the dapper dogs take your head chop it off
No father, fuck bein proper bitch we poppin off
And to top it off I'm droppin monster monologues
that's hot enough to piss your local arson off
That's me spittin this fucking garbage toss as you niggaz
Niggaz get familiar with the art of loss
Switch swag on you little dick fags (your bitch ass)
You fuckin dead bitch chips
I'm on my fifth bag wit'cho bitch ass

[Chorus]
She called me crazy, they called me crazy
They called me shady but it's a chordaroy life
I'm livin baby, I'm livin baby
I'm livin baby, it's a chordaroy life
And you called me shady, called me crazy
Called me lazy, I ain't your baby
It's a chordaroy life that I'm livin hazy
It's a chordaroy life that I'm livin, phase me

[Hodgy Beats]
People love Hodgy, I hate you though
I don't precipitate, bitch I H2O
And I move across your membrane, you lose against my insane
thoughts cause you're an outsider tryin to get in brain
I like girls but I don't fuck with tramps
I'm elephant tuskin and they succulents
I'm shavin off my boot hairs deciduosly
Break jaws Mr. Vigora, rigorously
I'm hot breeze, snot sneeze; I cop weed
for less of a percentage than I fuckin plot seeds
New racist, too vacant, mutations, natural selection
Bitch I got my swag card, natural protection
Pocket with a cache full of bashful weapons
I brandish and I flash tools and I have fools steppin
I'm a geophyte, move under the ground 'til I can see the light
Feed niggaz shells like my motherfuckin beach is nice

[Chorus]

[Tyler, the Creator]
When I say Wolf Gang, you say FUCK THAT
Room full of Wolves, inhalers and used blunt wraps
Fingers in the middle of bitches bodacious buttcracks
Enough fuckin atheist rappers to get a nun slapped {*screaming*}
This is fuck music here, let a couple sluts use it
Show their boobs, and I'll hop out the booth when I'm done poopin
Grab a couple gats, stuff 'em in the backpack
then take them to school for show and tell day screamin "Fuck students"
Backin up a bunch of fatherless kids and a pack of dust
could fuckin splat, to show you the fuckin Iraq in us
A bunch of fucking Wolves and rats havin niggaz the size of Shaq
backin up, like Juvenile biggest fan was a movin truck
Killin these niggaz off quick
Don't believe me? Then watch me empty out a full clip
Trigger being pulled, niggers in a ditch
That wasn't bullets, that was copies of "Bastards" you bitch

[Chorus]

[Outro: Tyler]
Wolf Gang! Free Earl
We see you nigga
"BlackenedWhite" in this motherfucker WHAT~?!</pre>
