[CHORUS: RAS CEYLON]
I Feel Good About It
Writing rhymes rockin mics on the grind
living this life like its only right
I Feel Good About It
hustlin strugglin bringing the substance
makin something out of nothing my people is lovin it
I Feel Good About It
maybe they should too
chosen few me and you and we both paid dues
I Feel Good About It
this that hungry bros. team got June bringing
the heat and we some real emcees

I got a fresh new style and I spit so clean
its like some wanna judge but them don't know me
I rhyme low key breath harmonies into beats
find melodies for streets up in this piece for keeps and I
feel good about the fact that I'm here
I've seen a lot of ill things these past 25 years 
lemme be clear some of it was bad and some good
but its all experience making life overstood
wouldn't change this for anything it made me who I am
everyday I master self and correct what I can
got plans solid but yo tomorrows not promised
so I stand and deliver honest truth gotta acknowledge
june22 the man behind the music
like 10 years ago he recruited me to use it
never abused it even when fools were ego cruising I just kept it movin
improving for the movement and I still do it moving and keep it for 
the movement

[CHORUS: RICHPORT THE SAVIOR]
I Feel Good About It
like I just got paid
friday nite bout to do the damn thing
I Feel Good About It
giving thanks and praise every breath is a gift in these last days
I Feel Good About It
like I just had a kid held it down with my queen now we bout to live
cuz we handling our biz smashin all the gigs hungry bros who we is

[RAS CEYLON + RICHPORT THE SAVIOR]
Hungry bros recognize the name its respect for the culture
we bringin to this game longevity pure love burnin up the fame
we earned our posiition so now hear the reign tell em clear the lane
its time for a change we takin it back to the roots where it came from
the same drum bangs in every heart pulse of nyahbinghi
bringing up a spark of good energy hood remedies
Ceylon and Richport creative chemistry 
sharin recipes preparing to eat
feel good food for thought no swine and no beef
we reach the highest peak thru faith and destiny

[RICHPORT THE SAVIOR]
Real good like bumpin through your hood or a hiphop function
in the woods burnin buds its a good day
and the sun is shining good music puts me in an irie mood
I'm in refinement balacing the line inbetween desiring hustling and striving
inspiring the struggle we survivin lifes alignments giving thanks
and grinding combining the goods of our environment
scientificnonfiction warning signs man its a victory dance
we equipped and advanced emmoworks throwback 
in our bboy stance drez on the cuts speaking with his hands
via capture of sound reaching all these fans
at the bottom of the barrell but still champs</pre>
