[Chorus: repeat 2X]
This young girl
She's a freak
She's up clubbing
Every night of the weekend
And all around town
It's the same old sound
Spread that fever
Let us all get down

[Rodde a.k.a Rigorod]
She loves the late night in the city action
To be the centre of attraction
Gifts of satisfaction
She wants your reaction (hey!)
Hey, watcha think her bottom weighs
Is it okay, or is it going late
Stop with you lies 'n', open your eyes
This is to be the last sin instead of vandalisin
This young girl put you in a song
To dance rule it's the second flow
So just let it role

[Chorus]

[Cham]
I like freaks like hardcore beats
Hangin out in the streets some boys that wont sleep
Crash a joint, let it all out, crane built
Too much money spending, talk about your romance
I like that low cut waistline
See through panties always corrupt my mind
I am what I am and I hope you like me too
The most beautiful thing in the world is a girl and thats true
Slink, skinny, high heels is my passion
Anything goin from street clothes to the latest french fashion
I got your back, say no more
Bad girls like it roar, UH

[Chorus]

Bridge: [Linda] dadedadedadeda!!

[Choru] (with Linda)

[Rigorod]
She's not even 15 but looks older than 19
So what they mean, the thought in every man's wet dreams
Straight VIP, never said a line, she can toss the game
Heard that every bastard knows her name
Pull'n all nighters, here we got war fighters
From gypsies, call girls, start poets with some writers
Plus she did things with her tongue
That leave ya outta breath (hu!)
Told ya (hu!) she was under 21

[Cham]
Two, three, down on the four
Sex in the city, hot like never before
This kiddie
Since bold place
Never settle for less
Ladies and gents
Welcome to the funkfest

[Chorus] - 2X</pre>
