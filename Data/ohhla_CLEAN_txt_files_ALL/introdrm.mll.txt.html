[Rick Ross]
You see
We dream chase
Cause that's all we was given to start with
They we realized
The dream was attainable
Now look at us

[Girl]
Maybach music

Countin money all I seem to hear is benji talkin
Hater we ain't conversatin it's just semis talkin
Countin money all I seem to hear is benji talkin
Countin money all I seem to hear is benji talkin
Hater we ain't conversatin it's just semis talkin
Used to be the boul
They said they have a penny on em
Now I walk around with twenty chains with like a milli on em
Lace up my boots
Put on my strap
And go lookin for that paper I'm like where it's at
They lookin at me
I'm starin back (I see you)
Feelin like I'm superman
Every time I wear this mac

Monday
It's probably 106 &amp; park
Tuesday
Probably in the hood where it get dark
Wednesday
Probably catch me swimmin with the sharks
With blood drippin from my shoes
These lous coated in my heart

[Rick Ross]
See dreamchasin is a occupation
Those with the job understand the process and manifestation
A dream starts as a thought
And it's nurtured, achieved and sustained
Then we go back in our minds for more work

Let me out my cell
Right back on the mission
Fresh from offa bail
Right back in the kitchen
Who the fuck gon pay my lawyer
I got
And like eighty grams of crack
He said the feds probably come for ya
I'm like oh lord
Copper said I tried to kill I'm when I go to court
I hope they don't find me guilty
It's my word against they word
And I won't get a chance to speak
I caught my case with nine of my niggas
And I'm the only one they beat

I took one for the team
Even though I had a dream like martin luther king
Who thought that I'd be cover of these magazines
Cause I be spittin fire flow on kerosene

Lemme talk to em
Uh
Fuck ya'll niggas gon say about me
My north niggas they don't play about me
South philly niggas that'll spray about me
A million dollar bail in a day bout me
Ain't gotta sound real cause they'll tell you that
I'm on the top floor, I started where the cellar at
Self made, bitches

[Rick Ross]
I had a dream one time
It was that I was gon make a lot of money
Doin what I wanted to do
I went after it
And it was a struggle to achieve
But you know what
I caught that bitch
Dreamchasers
This is where
Dreams become reality</pre>
