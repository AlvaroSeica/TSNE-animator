[Intro]
M-M-M-I crooked letter crooked letter
M-I crook-crook-crooked letter crooked letter
I, crooked letter crooked letter I
Hump back hump back I so I

[Chorus]
I got that constant distressin, found my profession
Can't get no restin, why niggas testin?!
Always suggestin, I'm askin questions
Life got me guessin
I got the blues, blues, blues, blues, blues, blues, blues
I got the blues, blues, blues, blues, blues, blues, blues
I got the blues

[Verse One]
Right, under my city lights lookin real pretty lights
Contemplatin on my shitty life
Wonderin if I had that pretty wife, big house, nice car
Would that make me feel like a star? I doubt it
Houses get repossessed like cars
And marriage only last a minute what you think they throwin rice for?
Gets so deep on these cuts homey they might scar
Shit what you think I'm holdin these dice for I stay rollin
The car ain't stolen officer it's all me
I don't appreciate that name you just called me
Could have said young black, gifted I'm all three
Long night, you ain't readin my rights, stall me
This shit appauls me how can I be so fuckin dope?!
Still they got me leapin through hoops and jumpin this fuckin rope
You mention me and don't say best somebody conned you
No 'Ye West my nigga I stay stressed 

[Chorus]
I got that constant distressin, found my profession
Can't get no restin, why niggas testin?!
Always suggestin, I'm askin questions
Life got me guessin
I got the blues, blues, blues, blues, blues, blues, blues
I got the blues, blues, blues, blues, blues, blues, blues
I got the blues

[Verse Two]
Look! I live my life on edge, know the ledge 'cause any minute I could slip
Leave yo' address with 'bout half left of a good clip
Shackle my face, black on my waist, my hip burn
Actors on that Hepburn fate made my neck turn
That boy snappin quick actin like you done just learned
Everything they gave you they made you I just earned
And now they say they try to heal up
It's right here cuz, is them headphones or earplugs?
Still I get overlooked, got razor raps
But they don't favor that shit over hooks
Gotta sit and have these stupid conversations over looks
It's Ice Age for real niggas it's over look
Ain't battlin niggas that beef shit is overcooked
All is 'gon be a sneak diss and y'all won't say my name
But I got people really dyin while y'all really lyin
Two funerals in a month can you say ashamed, this ain't a game
Listen! My granddaddy died, and now my aunt gone
Guess who the foundation for my family to stand on
Why the fuck you think I be so hands on?!
Feel like I'm movin forward and movin backwards with every damn song
Lord forgive me for every lie that I ever told
They wanna repent now I'm ready like Archie ever sold
I never sold out, and I never will
Bet I be the hardest for you haters to ever kill

[Chorus]
I got that constant distressin, found my profession
Can't get no restin, why niggas testin?!
Always suggestin, I'm askin questions
Life got me guessin
I got the blues, blues, blues, blues, blues, blues, blues
I got the blues, blues, blues, blues, blues, blues, blues
I got the blues

[Outro]
I got the blues, I got the blues</pre>
