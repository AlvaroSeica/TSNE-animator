Gangsta! (Gangsta)
Gangsta! (Gangsta)

    (Verse 1 - Twista)
Gang-bangin murder with the killin, stackin Phillys to the ceiling
bloody body chillin, can't fight the feeling, now I'm a Chi-Town building
and I'm rolling with New Orleans, 
what the fuck enemies gonna bring to the table?
I'm gonna train to slain you
Rollin with my gangstas Kane and Abel
In pain can you sustain them cables hooked on your back
who got you charged? Wanna get the mac off guard?
Nigga I don't know you so you better come hard
get your nieces, nephews, and cousins
takin bunches all of the sudden, who them niggas thats southern?
all the bullshit haters talking, I aint stuntin
we're gonna be ballin never fallin rollin hundreds in a 600 benz
steady stackin ends hit the block on 10, rollin with the twins
merciless thugs, bustin off slugs, 
so your family didnt know where you was
breakin the motherfuckers off for the set dub 2000
It happened to lack for the love what?
No fear strike first
Gonna roll, strike first, don't fit, 
to the death, gotta ride til we die
we the one, then if you gotta try, 
hollow points gotta fly, so holla bye, shorty don't cry
hold yo chest up, you about to get touched
That's what you get for bein a hoe 
and fuckin with niggas like us

    (Chorus - Kane and Twista 2x)

    (Kane)
We're straight thuggin, straight thuggin,

    (Kane)
Gansta! (Gangsta)
    (Kane)
We're straight thuggin, straight thuggin,

    (Twista)
Gotta get em all by the dozen,

    (Verse 2 - Kane)
Real ass niggas lets break some bread together
All you fake ass niggas yall gonna be dead together, 
niggas could never understand what the tec would do
turn all you smart mouth motherfuckers in a vest of bulls
in and out, in and out my bullets havin sex with you, 
im triggafied niggafied, my niggas ride, i do
Bitches got no class like a substitute teacher, 
disrespect that ass, take off my rings and beat ya, 
if i catch you doin bad, i got that right to heat ya
put some tens in yo meter, twist that cap like a two liter
what on earth would possess you to push me, take off your skirt

Bitch it was bound to happen

    (Chorus 2x)
