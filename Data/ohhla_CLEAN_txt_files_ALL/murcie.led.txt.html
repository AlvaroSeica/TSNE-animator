[Intro: Meek Mill]
Birdman, what up? (AUUUGH~!)
Last time I seen Bird, he said "Young nigga, get this money!"
FUCK these niggas~!
And you know what I said! I said, fuck em!
{DJ KHALED!} Uh..

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Murcielago when the doors go up
And when the money fall you know them hoes turn up
And when the money gone you know them hoes turn down
And I pray to God He don't let my soul BURN UP!

[Meek Mill]
Born sinner nigga, I was born winnin'; heart cold, but my soul warm in it
Glock 40 and I go to war with it, steady aim, shoota' with a form, with it (swish)
And I go on tour with it; if I see it, then you know I'm gon' get it
Yeah nigga, for the love of that paper, I got hoes sippin' liquor six in the mornin' with it
Id die for this cream, die for my dreams as I stay and I fight on the side of the ring
with my back to the rope, hear the crowd as they scream but I come out on top like Mohammad Ali - WHOOO~!
These hoes fuck so good, now lil nigga get money now
Same bitches laughin' at me, I was dead broke, gettin' head from 'em thinkin' how I'm funny now!
Brand new Rolls Royce in the summer now, big boy mink coats when they come around
And they wanna put a hole in my soul, head shot for a hater now simmer down

[Chorus] - 2X

[Birdman]
Yeah, what's poppin Khaled, nigga?
Top block, ya understand me? Yeah..

Eight million dollars on a brand new Lamb
Suicide like revolvers dont jam
Mountain top, nigga, high in his fame
Filthy rich, still doin' my thing
Popped off, we had to pop that spot
Jewels flyin', nigga, were so hot
Yachts, condos, livin' that life
Ill do it again and Ill pay that twice
BLAAAT~!

[Chorus] - 2X </pre>
