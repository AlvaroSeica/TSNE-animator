Hey
Come close

Be be as I am
Don't need your love, don't bring it back again
Back to the way it was when it began
No expectations, we were barely friends, barely friends

And I say it's too late
My wounded heart has found a better place
My freedom from you, now I celebrate
All I can do is try to stay away
So listen when I say

Boy I'm on your mind and you're in my heart
You ain't ready for love
No, not at all
I'm ready, I'm ready
You're not ready at all
I'm ready, I'm ready

Boy I'm on your mind and you're in my heart
You ain't ready for love
No, not at all
I'm ready, I'm ready
You're not ready at all
I'm ready, I'm ready

If I soot you now, please don't forget the times you run around
You left my heart up in the lost and found
The memories burned like a cigarette
How can I forget?

And you know it's too late
My wounded heart has found a better place
My freedom from you, now I celebrate
All I can do is try to stay away
So listen when I say

Boy I'm on your mind and you're in my heart
You ain't ready for love
No, not at all
I'm ready, I'm ready
You're not ready at all
I'm ready, I'm ready

Boy I'm on your mind and you're in my heart
You ain't ready for love
No, not at all
I'm ready, I'm ready
You're not ready at all
I'm ready, I'm ready

I hope you know that I've been ready ready ready ready
You're in my heart
I hope you know that I've been ready ready ready ready
You're in my heart
I hope you know that I've been ready ready ready ready
You're not ready at all
I hope you know that I've been ready ready ready ready

I'm ready, I'm ready
You're in my heart
I'm ready, I'm ready
You're in my heart
I'm ready, I'm ready
You're not ready at all
I'm ready, I'm ready

Boy I'm on your mind and you're in my heart
You ain't ready for love
No, not at all
I'm ready, I'm ready
You're not ready at all
I'm ready, I'm ready

Boy I'm on your mind and you're in my heart
You ain't ready for love
No, not at all
I'm ready, I'm ready
You're not ready at all
I'm ready, I'm ready</pre>
