Songz
It's Songbook, baby
Oh, oh, oh. Whoo

[Intro]
Ride, ride, come and ride with the Prince
Come ride, ride, ride, ride with the Prince
Come ride, come ride, come ride
Uh, let's go

[Trey Songz]
Friday night, and I'm home
just chillin on the sofa
Relaxin, I'm so glad the week is over
I got my remote
Good sack of that green
I'ma lean and smoke
Goin through my cell
for the number of a chick that I met last week
and her body ain't no joke
She picked up on the first ring
"What took you so long to call me?
Recognized your name and number
from the caller ID"
She said her room mate is gone
and she all alone
Let me get your street address
let me get dressed, and hung up the phone
And it's on

[Pre-Chorus]
She want it and I want it too
but I'm unprepared
And we came so close to goin raw dog that we both got scared
And she said, "I ain't ready to have no babies."
Jumped up put my clothes back on
I was just about to get some
had to make a store run

[Chorus]
Store run
pack of three up at the counter
Store run
be back in less than half an hour
Store run
I need protection and I'm out
wait for me, keep it warm
I had to make a store run

[Trey Songz]
Speedin', switchin lanes, and I'm flyin
and tryin to get back to her
before she changes her mind
Cuz if I take too long
she might put her clothes back on
Henny in my system
she tipsy on that Grey Goose
It's obvious what she's tryna get into
Top huggin them curves (them curves)
Got a nigga like me at a loss for words
I know she can tell that I'm wit it
wanna get it, while inside your tee
she can tell when I'm close to her
She keep lickin her lips
she touchin and she grabbin
Oh
I'ma throw her the bone
I'ma give it to her all night long
I want it bad, oh so bad
But I know that it's wrong
Here we go

[Pre-Chorus] + [Chorus] - 2X

[Trey Songz]
All I could do is think of being inside you
drivin like I'm up out of my mind
Baby here I come
And you can take your clothes back off

[Chorus] - 3X

[Trey Songz]
I know, I know
shoulda thought of this before
But who would've thought that we'd end up right on the kitchen floor?
I ain't ready to have no babies
No ifs, ands, buts, or maybes
I'm tryna keep it safe
Girl ain't you heard of AIDS?</pre>
