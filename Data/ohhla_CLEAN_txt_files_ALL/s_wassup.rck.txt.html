[Chorus: Ab-Soul]
They know I put it down, now they wanna say wassup (hey)
When you see me in your town, say wassup (hey), roll around, say wassup (hey)
Even ones who wear the crown say wassup (hey), that's wassup (hey)
Break it down, that's wassup (hey), blow a pound, that's wassup (hey), heyyy
"All day every day, I be on my 3-0" that's wassup (hey)
"All, all day every day" that's wassup, heyyy
"All day every day, I be on my 3-0" that's wassup (hey)
"All, all day every day" that's wassup, heyyy

[Ab-Soul]
And my taillight broke like a promise homie
This the realest shit I wrote, on my momma homie
My teachers used to call my momma on me
Now I'm a rap star and I can fuck my momma's homies ('Soul!)
Me and ScHoolboy hit the liquor store
Chocolate swisher burn slow, how sweet?
Who got the 'dro? Who tryna chief like Pocahontas daddy?
And I'm off that granddaddy kush, I'm finna start a family

[Kendrick Lamar]
I'm ghetto, my Kool-Aid need mo' sugar
Five star suite, you ain't know, sugar? (you ain't know, bitch?)
I'm chilling, bumping Anita Baker
Caked up, they wonder why I don't need a baker
But really though, I just need a hater
So I ask 'em for they number when I see a hater
Ask Obama if I don't know about presidents
Keep them dead motherfuckers resting in my money clip

[Chorus]

[ScHoolboy Q]
Look up in the mirror and my gangsta told me, what it do?
Cap'n Crunch and Top Ramen, all a nigga ever knew
Got a bitch to twist a blunt and pop a nigga collar too
Who that nigga standing over there? That's that nigga Q
What it do? That's wassup, bang this in your Tonka truck
Everybody rocking chucks and pistol packing, that's a must
Sagging and my ass showing mami, and the cops knowing
all I wanna do is smoke a blunt, let it bump

[Jay Rock]
Yeah, I'm looking in the mirror and a nigga say, wassup Rock?
And that nigga looked back at me and said, boy you certified
Took my '87 Regal, put it in a chop shop
Stash spot, .45, run up, you gonna die
Looking for a pretty bitch who can twerk it and throw it back
Nigga diss me, no I ain't missing, I'm throwing shots back
Jay Rock, top cat, and I'm still a Top Dawg
Boxed in that Porsche Box like I'm fighting southpaw

[Chorus]

[Verse Five]
Ab: Uh, and I'm 'Solo, take a photo, blowing dodo in a dojo
KL: We a green light, you a no-go, hey Q, go
SQ: No, Rock go
JR: I'm a Rock though like Barack though, and my eyes low, and I drive slow
    like Paul Wall
SQ: Give it back though, I got y'all
Ab: No, fuck that, I'm a ball hog
KL: No, fuck that, they gon' fall off
SQ: Got a sawed-off
    I'ma hop out, let it all off, hop back in, then I haul off
KL: We situated, we hit the pavement so hard we all got ground to play with
Ab: A challenger is like last year calendars, yup
JR: You're all outdated
KL: We all amazing, you all can hate it, you can live or die, that's your ultimatum
    Married to the game, at the alter wasting, a pound of white rice from the tribe of Asians
SQ: Niggas, they ride for me, bitches, they desire me
    And what's the one thing they hate the most?
JR: Saying bye to me
