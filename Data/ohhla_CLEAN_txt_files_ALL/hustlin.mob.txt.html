[A few niggas talikin' in the beginning of song]

[The Jacka]
These are cold days, for real
Had to smack him in his face   
With the cold steel   
Outside late night
In that stormy weather
Like whatever   
How we [?] through the ghetto
Wear a nigga through his leather   
Coke snatch the hottest show S.L.K.   
Nine eight forthin' you show me the stash
Pump him in his chest
Then I smash
Damn near losing control   
But I maintain like a crow
Behind the wheel with a murder case   
No mistakes
In the brain
Come follow me
And see what I see muthafucka

[Husalah]
I gotta hustle in the rain   
So I stay focused with my eyes on the prize
Niggas ain't livin' right   
One: I'm a ball till I die
Armani stacks will beat the set   
When ya'll realize
Your next step could be death   
Because it's do or die   
So who are you, who am I
Do ya'll niggas really know
Black on black crimes
Blessed with my nine
It's savage grind until I go   
Knock into yo dome split
Callin' the shots   
Fallin' yay spot to spot
Hood's crawlin' with narcs
Couple rocks is what I manage
I'm investin' my chips in the game
I chip [?????] to kicks and I flip
Fuck the fame   
It's gettin' deep   
Niggas is out for my pain
I put a depth on a nigga's weapon
Choke his ass in the game
All in the rain nigga [echoes]
My niggas [?] know
And I won't see him in the game

[Chorus] x2
I used to go outside nigga hustle in the rain
I try to pray to repent on my sins   
But the pain was so intense
I didn't think it would help
I'm still searching for the knowledge of self
Snatchin' my check up off the shelf

[Fed X]
I've done adapted to this environment
Now they can't stop me
A Mob Figga
Military tactics menace to society
One of the chosen five
That lead immortal lives
Snatchin' all the product
Breakin' every bone in the closet
I'm out to get the data
The top secret information got me took
I'm bendin' every law in the book
I fled the scene with two nines in the air   
Sereal number scraped with no trace
And known to race
To get this pace
Imported weapons
Army fatigues and body vests
I'm restin, for armageddon, with the illuminati
Tales of  Demias, Twentieth century, raised right
Its third war!!
Busted hinges and broken doors
Interrogation and infiltration on the five figaz
And I'm a hustle in the rain until I die nigga

[AP.9]
I used to hustle all night long   
Pullin' 24 hours  
Livin' my life wrong
Stickin' to movin' and pushin' zones
Flashin' that white chrome
Flashin' lights on
I'm postin' in the rain
And fin to pay [?] a dopefiend's brain
When I hit my niggas up   
They see that boy done went insane
Then hit a lick for the caine
Then skiped town on the money train   
When he get back
Ain't gon' be no get back   
Sat back on the train like the mack
Chokin' on the sack
Cuz it gets stormy in this rainy season
We ain't gone sign no treason   
Just find another reason to leave 'em bleedin'
No breathin', body cold
This must be the "El Niño"
But I hear my cousins   
They was dumping up on me [?]
With much impression
Impression on this timber
With the Smith and Wesson lesson
Is what I'm givins a fuck the shit you dressin'
He confessin'
Trying to search some game but uhh   
I'm serving pain nigga
In the rain figga   
You know I'm hustling [echoes out]

[Chorus] x2

[Ridah]
I used to hustle in the rain
Holdin' it down   
Feel my pain
See fake niggas pushing cakes nigga   
They'll never deal the game
Peep the hostage situation
The little nigga and the fo' fifth
Junior facin' united and blood plotted
Got it twisted I admit it
Kind of liked it when I did it
Now it's official
Even though I knew they couldn't fuck wit it
I'm a product of this shit I spit
It's the life I'm livin'
Take a look at the car I was given   
My mama's [?] gold chains
Most of the time I called the dosia   
The ghetto child I'll always own
Fear of the hope of being chosen
But the world is my opponent
We all want it
If you never had it   
And get up on it then we fallin'
And if I [?] out the game
Then all my hoes will be hunted
My goal's to see Figaz in the rain
Gettin' blunted
I'm hustlin' in the rain nigga

[Chorus] x2

*talking over chorus*
This ya'll nigga [?]
At the time of this recording he's here
But he ain't here no more
Sometime that's how it go</pre>
