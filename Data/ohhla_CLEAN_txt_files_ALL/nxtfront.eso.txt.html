[Bliss]
So I heard if you really really want something
Live life like a goal kicker see the target envision the whole picture
Clock strikes every second of your life
Til the bottom of the ninth and you're pitching a no hitter
Like on that note I'mma carry this flame
Of these ideas with the marriage of change
So connect like the eyes that sight the shooting star
it's the pride to fight for who we are
A home is what mother earth has given you
And mother nature makes you individual
To shift your eyes of the tube
To the view of these motherfucking elephants sitting in our living room
The reason my thoughts are free is
Cuz I'm dreaming before I fall asleep
And if you're present in the present it's a present
The essence of the message is a legend
Symbiosis the wonder life brings
Create your fate something I sing
Cuz everything we do
Everything we say
Everything we touch resonates like butterfly wings

[Chorus]
We won't run
We can fight all that keeps us up at night
there is far to go now lets not waste a minute more in denial

[Eso]
If it is real it can blow your mind like when DJ Izm first showed me Tribe
Call it a quest but it's more like a trip
Every thought is a gift that can cause an eclipse so
Don't listen when they tell you lies
I'm proof you can rise above
Fear's not here I kicked out the doubt
So I have no excuse to hide or run
So I let it flow in the booth when I'm rhyming
Just to show you the beauty behind things
Think positive seize the chance like the ball's in the hoop before it leaves my hand
Damn that was a Jordan quote
Still I thought you ought to know
I'm just trying to pass on wisdom
And hope there's a message in the last song written
If not keep the toys
Doing nothing is an easy choice
Whatever genre we need a voice to fight for our rights like a beasty boy

[Chorus]
We won't run,
We can fight
all that keeps us up at night
there is far to go
now lets not waste a minute more in denial

[Bridge]
We won't run we can walk
To a place we escape
Free of thought we can fight
we have a choice
we can build we have a voice
We won't feel or be controlled
its this right here that can feed your soul
Light years a speed
we can bring to flight
The ideas that a speed can just spring to life

[Chorus 2]
We won't run,
We can fight
all that keeps us up at night
there is far to go
now lets not waste a minute more
cuz we won't run
we can fight all that keeps us up at night
there is far to go
now lets not waste a minute more of our lives, our lives</pre>
