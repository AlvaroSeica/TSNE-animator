[Intro: Money]
Let me show you boy {*panting*}
Uh-huh, are you ready?
Fantasy (oh) it could be (so) good and we
(I was just thinkin' ... about you)
the wildest thing (you have) ever dreamed (boy)
(So what will it be?)

[Money]
Just lookin at you shorty lights a flame inside (inside)
I'm wondering if you can come and help put out the fire (fire)
But you can get at me baby, tell me what you like
Cause I can be your all boy, I can be your love toy
If you ain't busy baby, I'm all yours tonight (tonight)
Let imagination take us further, feelin nice
Travellin a dream (dream) we can bring something to life
that no one's ever seen yet, can I

[Chorus: Money]
Show you what it's like beyond your fantasy (oh) it could be (so)
good and we... might just get it hot up in the
wildest thing (you have) ever dreamed (boy) let me
Show you what it's like beyond your fantasy (oh) it could be (so)
good and we... might just get it hot up in the
wildest thing (you have) ever dreamed (boy)

[Money]
Just think of all the tasty things that we can try (try)
The karma you can have bein within Money can buy (oh-ho-ho-ho~!)
We ain't even gotta keep it quiet
Boy all my walls are soundproof, I can scream your name too
While you playin house, we will not disturb
not police or neighbors, you get all that you deserve
Boy I got this I'm naked if you can conjure up the nerve
to come see what if feels like, can I

[Chorus]

[Money]
You have dreamed boy-hoyyyy...
Touch it touch it feel it, roll around it if you like
Taste it taste it then embrace it again a second time
Don't you waste it, you'll regret it, Cause I can satisfy
Any fantasy that you can come with, can I
