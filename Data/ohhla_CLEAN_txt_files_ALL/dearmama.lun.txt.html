[Verse 1]
Ugh Dear Mama, I been goin' through some thangs baby
everywhere I go niggaz actin shady and crazy
 got my back against the wall but I did not fall
 'cuz these niggaz get on ya if you ain't got balls
But I can't play the hard road I gotta stick to the strip and count my pesos
you always told me that my daddy wasnt ever shit
he put his hands on ya plus he always yellin BITCH
and thats the reason why I hate his ass 'till this day
didn't grow no love for him 'till the 10th grade
I gotta tell ya that you did a good fuckin' job
and 'till this very day I really ain't got no prob

[Chorus]
Dear Mama Dear Mama, I been goin' through some thangs baby
Dear Mama, I been goin' through some thangs baby
Dear Mama, I been goin' through some thangs baby
But I got Love for ya if ya still that Crazy
Dear Mama, I been goin' through some thangs baby
Dear Mama, I been goin' through some thangs baby
Dear Mama, I been goin' through some thangs baby
But I got love for ya if ya still that crazy
Dear Mama, I been goin' through some thangs baby
Dear Mama, I been goin' through some thangs baby
Dear Mama, I been goin' through some thangs baby
But I got Love for ya if ya still that crazy

[Verse 2]
Yeah mama I done growed up
and got that attitude like I don't give a fuck
they call me lunasicc but names ain't a dam thang
I give it all up for you fuck this rap game
I know you made a bad decision when you smoked dope
but I bet I did some shit that you don't know
so bear wit me when I cuss you out some day
I gotta leave cuz my pride won't let me stay
Fuck a bitch that's a lesson that was taught well
Dont fuck wit 'em if the hoe ain't got mail
that's why I love you and I try ta tell you everyday
I'm your son and I take your love anyway

[Chorus]
Dear Mama Dear Mama, I been goin' through some thangs baby
Dear Mama, I been goin' through some thangs baby
Dear Mama, I been goin' through some thangs baby
But I got Love for ya if ya still that Crazy
Dear Mama, I been goin' through some thangs baby
Dear Mama, I been goin' through some thangs baby
Dear Mama, I been goin' through some thangs baby
But I got love for ya if ya still that crazy
Dear Mama, I been goin' through some thangs baby
Dear Mama, I been goin' through some thangs baby
Dear Mama, I been goin' through some thangs baby
But I got Love for ya if ya still that crazy

[Verse 3]
Dear Mama, your little boy growed up cool
even though I didnt graduate from Bank High School
I had to run wit O.G.'s thinkin' just like me
Ain't nothin but the D Game and endless Ki's
Sleepin in and out of motels stackin my mail
wasnt worried bout the letters I recieve in jail
I give thanks mama, To all of lifes trauma
I had to let you know Coleone love mama
Daddy gave me female game that remains real cool
But Mama gave me coochie game that I use as a tool
Ya I love you baby ain't a thang gone change that
I feel like J Kat girl we makin some scratch

[Chorus]
Dear Mama Dear Mama, I been goin' through some thangs baby
Dear Mama, I been goin' through some thangs baby
Dear Mama, I been goin' through some thangs baby
But I got Love for ya if ya still that Crazy
Dear Mama, I been goin' through some thangs baby
Dear Mama, I been goin' through some thangs baby
Dear Mama, I been goin' through some thangs baby
But I got love for ya if ya still that crazy
Dear Mama, I been goin' through some thangs baby
Dear Mama, I been goin' through some thangs baby
Dear Mama, I been goin' through some thangs baby
But I got Love for ya if ya still that crazy
