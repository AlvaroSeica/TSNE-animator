One by one I knocks 'em out

[Mack Wilds] (*Jadakiss) (**DJ Tedsmooth)
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!! (Call me king 'cause I'm that dude)
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!! (That's-That's true, said I don't mean to brag)
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!! (Let me work it out)
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!! (*EH HEH!!!) (Yeah! Forever!)
(**TEDSMOOTH! STRAIGHT FACE! U REMEMBER!!!)

[Verse One: Jadakiss]
Uh! They just livin for the moment
We livin it like we own it
Killin the comp crushin every opponent
Knowin if it ain't about money I don't condone it
Cash in plastic, still carry the chrome shit
Me and my boo, comin through, on some grown shit
See who I came with, know who I'm goin home with
Fill your glass up, Rose, Patron
Three is company, four better a bonus
I give you the real deal other dudes a clone it
All dependin on how bad you want it
After the wheels fall off ride the donut
(Ride) Put it in the air we stonin
(Light it) It goin man to man we zonin
(Swing it) Nothin is too much is the slogan
(Nothin) They just lease it we own it

[Verse Two: Mack Wilds]
Nothing's too much, words that I live by, and that's just how I do, do, I do
I'm young right now, but I won't be forever
So I'm a live it up like that's true, you might wanna roll with me too
Said I don't mean to brag, but I live a life that most can only dream about, yeah
So baby come be my dream girl, pick a fantasy and let me work it out, yeah, oh yeah

[Chorus: Mack Wilds]
Tell me where you wanna go, what you wanna do
Said we livin it like we own it! own it! own it!
Said I'm on top of the world, what I need is you
Said we livin it like we own it! own it! own it! Yeah!

[Verse Three: Mack Wilds]
Said it's never too much, so just let the drinks flow
Later on you can come through, through, come through
You know you're the flyest, they should call you your highness
And call me king 'cause I'm that dude, and all you gotta do is leave your crew
Said I don't mean to brag, but I live a life that most can only dream about, yeah
So baby come be my dream girl, pick a fantasy and let me work it out, yeah, oh yeah

[Chorus: Mack Wilds]
Tell me where you wanna go, what you wanna do
Said we livin it like we own it! own it! own it!
Said I'm on top of the world, what I need is you
Said we livin it like we own it! own it! own it! Yeah!

[Bridge: Mack Wilds]
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!! Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!! Ahhhhh!!!!
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!! Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!! Ahhhhh!!!!
What you talkin 'bout?! We run this town
We got it sewn up, because we own it
What you talkin 'bout?! You deserve this crown!
We got it sewn up, because we, ownnnnnnnnnn it!!!!
Because we, ownnnnnnnnnn it!!!!

[Chorus: Mack Wilds]
Tell me where you wanna go, what you wanna do
Said we livin it like we own it! own it! own it!
Said I'm on top of the world, what I need is you
Said we livin it like we own it! own it! own it! Yeah!
