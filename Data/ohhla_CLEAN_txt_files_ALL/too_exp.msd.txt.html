[Verse One: Ms. Dynamite]
He doesn't want me around
He's got something to hide
I think he wants a clown
Someone to take for a ride
What I keep tellin' him

[Chorus]
I'm too experienced to be taken for a stroll
Too experienced for someone to rock 'n' roll
I'm too experienced to be taken for a ride
And I know It's not my foolish pride

[Verse Two: Ms. Dynamite]
He hates the sight of me
Because I turned his offer down
He's always sayin' we were meant to be
Somehow he thought I'd be his clown
But this is what I say

[Repeat Chorus]

[Verse Three: Barrington Levy]
She doesn't want you around
Because you have too much to hide
I think you are a clown
Not fit to be a bonafide
But I'm tellin' you
She's too experienced to be taken for a stroll
Too experienced for someone to rock 'n' roll
Too experienced to be taken for a ride
That's why her name is Dynamite</pre>
