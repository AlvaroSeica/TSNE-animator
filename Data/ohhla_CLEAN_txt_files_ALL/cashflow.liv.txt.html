Understand me
Yeah...

[Chorus: Stretch](x4)
Gotta keep the cash flow and stay on the go yo,
Gotta keep the cash flow
understand me?

[Verse 1: Stretch]
Huh..
Understand me
A man be stressed
Nevertheless
I'm wearin' a vest and packing like the rest
Test me, to be a mess, G
Drop another hit and take the cash with finess see,
Being a G with pimp nigga mentality
Rakin' in the bacon just became a reality
Cuz fakin' is forsakin' when it comes to Thuglife
The drug life
You know you wasn't promised tomorrow so you hug life
And make the dough you know needs to be made
And gotta hustle with a plan the fuckin' cops can't fade
Listen, I'm dishing givin' you direction
Show no affection
Wreck son, you gonna have to wet one!
Gun smoke, so don't provoke the murdah case
A nigga got no time to waste
Understand? uh...

[Chorus: Stretch](x4)
Gotta keep the cash flow and stay on the go yo,
Gotta keep the cash flow
understand me?

[Verse 2: Stretch]
Understand me...
My plan be loaded with street game
So plain clothes'd cop wanna know my name
Pain filling my brain rapidly, took over my heart
Now I got some niggaz after me
For taking out frustration on a nation with my glock
Niggaz catch shots and punk bitchez catch knots, hops
Cops are scared and feared by the ???
Cuz we sent some people who can talk to them decently
And they agreed to raise up for a buck
Give 'em piece of the action
Raise some satisfaction
Just a fraction of the money was theirs
And they would stop all the harrassin' and the drive-by stares
And who cares, when you makin' money?
Move with power
Strictly movin' keys,
I'm makin' Gs by tha hour
Understand?

[Chorus: Stretch](x4)
Gotta keep the cash flow and stay on the go yo,
Gotta keep the cash flow
understand me?

[Verse 3: Majesty]
I say, we gotta get it
Nevermind people sweat it
We paid 'em off, we get'n money that'll shake 'em off,
Residential, bulletproof, got snipers on tha roof
How we play Grand Imperial like the C-I-A
And any powerful organization you can think of
We makng ??? hard as hell ???
Haters gotta ?? up, bored us so we drink up
Satellite niggaz, anywhere on earth we link up
Loyalty's on stand-by, we force flying through tha damn sky
Puffin' haze, askin the lord why everybody can't be livin' like this?
Paradise, goin' and doin' wat'cha wanna do
That's livin' life
Three hundred thousand dollar cars
Winnin' the city, hit the clubs
Spend five thousand at the bar
Talk power for days
Dodging legs that was raised
Still bumpin' in the hood
Riding by tha yellow tape
Cuz some gorrillaz aped out
Ya best bet stay low
Get the dough and hit the quickest escape route

[Chorus: Stretch](x4)
Gotta keep the cash flow and stay on the go yo
Gotta keep the cash flow
understand me?</pre>
