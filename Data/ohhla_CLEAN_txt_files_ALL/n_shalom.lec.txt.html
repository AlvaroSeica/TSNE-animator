Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Chorus]
I wake up, before I throw a beater on
Fall to my knees, thank the Lord for the new Shalom
I-I wake up, before I throw a beater on
Fall to my knees, thank the Lord for the new Shalom
I-I wake up, before I throw a beater on
Fall to my knees, thank the Lord for the new Shalom
I-I wake up, I-I wake up, I-I thank-thank-thank the Lord for Sha-Sha-Shalom

[Lecrae]
I wake up before I throw a beater on
I thank the Lord for peace, or you can say shalom
I'm on and I'm gone out the door I'm gon' rep my home
New Jerusalem, yeah you know where we belong
Got the Word in my heart
When the day start and the darkness wanna get us sparked up
So I keep a guard up, cause the sin in me
wanna get the best of me and have me all scarred up
And I know I'm marked up by the Spirit still in me
fillin me up with everything I need
Yeah I got that cheese, but I don't need a piece
I just need peace, please
This life ain't easy matter fact it's opposite
and I got the test results I'm very positive
That's why I'm on this track with Pro
because I'm posed to give some potent portions
of potion proportionate to poster kids
Of pain and suffering whose daddy never loved on them
and wouldn't know the peace of God if it was placed in from of them
And I was one of them, I don't take my life for granted
So I'm a use this day tryna share my faith and pray that seeds are planted

[Chorus]
I wake up, before I throw a beater on
Fall to my knees, thank the Lord for the new Shalom
I-I wake up, before I throw a beater on
Fall to my knees, thank the Lord for the new Shalom
I-I wake up, before I throw a beater on
Fall to my knees, thank the Lord for the new Shalom
I-I wake up, I-I wake up
I-I thank-thank-thank the Lord for Sha-Sha-Shalom

[Pro]
Early in the mornin A.M., you know that I thank him
cause he still calls me clean regardless of the mess I lay in
My vision on the throne, clearer than Patron
yes sir I am gone, in my zone
thinking 'bout the way my Father put me on
It's nothing but grace how he's still gives me faith
and he died for the ultimate villain
After this I obey regardless I'm chained
when I should have been dead but I'm livin
See I know when I'm wrong he won't leave me alone
that's the beauty of God and his mercy
So I'm singing this song about him on the cross
where my heart was the item of purchase
While livin with pride so worthless
Say they wrestle and fight but I merk it
Whether live or down, dedicated to Christ
yes sir I'm a stand on my purpose
Put my faith in him cause he's perfect, insurance like Geico
cause if I do not have his love I'm Norman Bates psycho
I go hard, I still Rebel with Lecrae.
Give my whole life for the King, don't Trip just let him Invade
I Sho Baraka Obama this peace is more than just worth it
so call Tedashii tell him Identity Crisis averted.

[Chorus]

[Lecrae]
24/7 all the time, yeah I'm on my grind
yin' everyday I'm tryin', rhyme, hope to save they lives
Peace what I got, I feel released from the knots
sin bound me in but Jesus had the keys to the locks
Life is boot camp, yeah I know the drill, flesh kill
but his will, it's with his peace that I'm filled and it's real
Earth is not my home, while I roam and roam
got the Lord up on my dome restin' in that new shalom
See it goes C.H.R.I.S.T. G.O.D. his spirit inside of me
And without his L.O.V.E. I'm another lost soul so obviously
When I drank the Livin' Water that's nothing more
than a product of the grace through faith that I found in him
The love he gives could accurse of sin, why should I ever give in?
So chase that money, get your wrist coders, refrigerators
I will be an outcast 'til he raise me up elevator
Me and you, yo momma, yo cousin, my brother
pray we never sell our soul for a chance to be stuntin
cause everything that's good in me the Lord he's done it, run it

[Chorus]</pre>
