[Dirt Gritie]		
Momma ain't raise no fool you think I took these lumps 
When I was young just to soften my rump
So ya'll just be easy keep talking sleazy
We moving up like George and Weezy
Zig-zag-zig this hip-hop society 
That's how you gain Notoriety 
I see you copycats try'na to get right 
Updating formulas, rebuilding web sites 
We pioneered how you spit on the mic 
That west end slang got you anxious to write 
Dog it ain't a thing I'm the hustling type 
While you talk that slang we living the life 
Its even iller we write prescriptions 
Check your street pharmaceutical rap collection
Flying meteor style, want a see my weapon 
Because once it's unsheathed all MC's I'm deading

[Chorus  Jerys  1X]
People say they want it raw
Then give them what they're looking for
The MFM
No Stopping them
People say they want it raw
Then give them what they're looking for
The MFM
We're Droppin' Gems

[Young Mav] 		
I move my right foot, then my left, then repeated the pattern
And been accepted in more circles than the planet of Saturn
I've been here and there, to hell and back
Spit some intellect incase y'all miss your history class
Straighten up and fly right, my quest is 5 Mics
Or rate my niceness with your largest shirt sizes
I'm the livest, far from my zenith 
Flows is ice cold and my clothes be the cleanest
Cause the flows that I shoot, act as prostitutes
I put them on the street to pleasure and they come back with my loot
Sorry, I had to bring it back
Just in case you never heard the track with Fatty Mack
Cause when lines like that date back to 99
It's obvious, someone here's ahead of their time
Consistent all my life, confused it with conceit
But since I will not lose they better help you cheat

[Chorus  Jerys  1X]
People say they want it raw
Then give them what they're looking for
The MFM
No Stopping them
People say they want it raw
Then give them what they're looking for
The MFM
We're Droppin' Gems

[K-Riz]		
Y'all know who it is, the game is ours we out to prove it kid
Y'all niggaz lose, that's how I do mentally bruise the shit
Trapped in chaos, Riz the master verbalist sprayer
Murderous rap slayer, mind decapitator
Infinite data, so vivid I could take it to another planet
But I choose to stay on earth to wreak havoc
Cats need to man up, cause taking over is easy
If most of y'all niggaz is scared to stand up
Had enough, fuck a punch line y'all getting snuffed
It's lunchtime how I eat these niggaz up
Effortless, adrenaline be running through me
Killing this shit with Poli Live and my nigga Oozee
Jacuzzi dreams, I've gone far beyond spitting bars
Movie screen, chilling in the cut sipping perion   
Cats is average, we the microphone savages
Words I recite will damage it, the year of the Mavericks 

[Chorus  Jerys  2X]
People say they want it raw
Then give them what they're looking for
The MFM
No Stopping them
People say they want it raw
Then give them what they're looking for
The MFM
