Typed by: AZ Lyrics

She got it Every time you see her man she fresh to death on her shit
She got it, she always got a new hustle, she bout her bizness
She got it, she the real definition when they talk about independence
She got it, she got it, she got it, she got it

I said lil mama got it going on, she really do
She holler daddy let me thru you know I gotta stack too
She keep her hair done, nails and toes too
Vendi bags and prada, plus she rock her Gucci too
And she got her own money lil mama be swagged out
Keisha Cole hairstyle, Lil mama be swagged out
That's my baby, that's what I named her
Get her baby go beyonce shame her

She got it, Every time you see her man she fresh to death on her shit
She got it, she always got a new hustle, she bout her bizness
She got it, she the real definition when they talk about independence
She got it, she got it, she got it, she got it

You know me I walked up on her as soon as I seen her tail
I said look I know you got it she said yeah but it's not for sale
I said I'm not trying to buy ya lady, I just wanna try
I just wanna taste your pie to see if your ish good as mine
Then she say her ish exotic, this that ish you barely find
If you talking about that juicy, I got that shit all the time
Say I got that hitter quitter, mama thought that I was lyin
Hit her with it, now she addicted, bottom line

She got it, Every time you see her man she fresh to death on her ish
She got it, she always got a new hustle, she bout her bizness
She got it, she the real definition when they talk about independence
She got it, she got it, she got it, she got it

Man, she gotta man, how she get that
Ish I don't know, thats her bizness
She wash, she douche, clean her kitchen
Yeah She the shit, I forgot to mention
When she come thru, she makes them hoes mad at me
You do that I ain't lyin you make daddy glad
She got a J Lo ass with a Mary J swag
Gutta like trina and Keyshia shawti bad

She got me thinking bout making her my number one
When she step out them girls be like where she get that from
She hold me down, minus the stress and the drama
And I don't know where she get that body
But lil mama got it

She got it, Every time you see her man she fresh to death on her shit
She got it, she always got a new hustle, she bout her bizness
She got it, she the real definition when they talk about independence
She got it, she got it, she got it, she got it</pre>
