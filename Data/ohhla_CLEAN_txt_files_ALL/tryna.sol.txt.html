[Solomon Childs]
I'm sitting in the hood writing rhymes, and after all these years
I'm comtemplating about doing crimes
As if I haven't had enough bids
As if I haven't had enough of missing my kids
Let my moms tell it, my baby gon' break through
Let the homey's tell it, the Damu, gon' retire the crew
Let the old school reach on it
Finally the youth'll have somebody they can relate to
And in this life, I've seen alot of trouble
And got myself caught up, in alot of trouble
I should of stayed in Cali, instead of coppin' that Tahoe
I should of put the money on the house in the Valley
I should of stopped and promissed
But I love my babies
And will do anything to feed my babies

[Chorus: Pleasant]
Living this hard life
Always having crazy times
Trying to stay up, trying to move on
But I hear that same song
It ain't nothing like being on the streets
Knowing who your real homey
Looking around, hitting the ground
But I'm not going down, no, no, no

[Solomon Childs]
So many dreams, so many times I saw myself
Stagnated by petty things, and I know I'm just a kid from the ghetto
Who grew up on Fat Albert, up late
Hoping Run-DMC will be on Jay Leno
Or Edo G. and the Bulldogs
Had my share, having fights after school
With some of Staten Island's bulldogs
Cuz I wouldn't let them extort the pastures of my leaves
And God bless my cousin Mercury
From the Force MD's, he always said
Talent's just something that they can't deny
And never lose the hunger in you eyes
Never, never, let 'em see you cry
And you can't save everybody
That's the way life is, you live and you die
For sure.. muthafucka...

[Chorus]

[Hook: Pleasant]
Ain't nobody but me
I chose who I wanted to be
I always looked down on my seeds
And say, baby, follow your dreams

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
