Double G's guaranteed to make you jump
Prod making beats that everybody wanna bump
pump it in the Church, pump it in the clubs
and if you got the humps let it bang in your trunk

[Mr. Solo]
(just slide, slide, slipadee slide)
me the mic and step back and let Solo get it crackin
if you ready like Freddy I can rock steady
keep 'em hot and sweaty as I drops like a Chevy
on gowans, but oh some still ain't understandin me (??)
I takes the party single-handedly, with no profanity
cuz vanity leads to calamity
and thats insanity, id rather rap about the Man in me
(who is He?) oh He be the G O D, dwellin in the Double G
and if He's for me who can trouble me?
I got 'em bouncin to the ouncin, I say what counts and
I see the mic and like Mufasa i'll be pouncin
cuz if you can't make 'em move then your groove ain't hittin
and if they don't repeat your lyrics then you really ain't spittin
but we get props on both sides of what we do
cuz wit ministry and music we true, I thought you knew

Prod making beats that everybody wanna bump

and if you got the humps let it bang in your trunk
this is for the dance floor
this is for you to roll on, hold on
I don't have to say no mo, I think you already know
(and now we gonna show you how the West Coast rocks)

The mic goes around like a pipe in a smoker's basement
while I flow Mr. Solo stands adjacent
I'm from South Central row, don't tempt me do'
I treat the beat like figuero and I pit the flow (??)
admit you got to get to hit to spit you Scripture
as I stand G'ed you take my picture
they like the bang bang boogey
up jump the boogey, coming thru with the G's we got the goodies
everywhere we go people ask me how we do it
I said " its just the G in me, so clap your hands to it "
or better yet move ya body
and scream, the Double G's can make you jump at the party
I got you where I want you, don't you like how I come with the Son
He do you like you never been done, its all fun
I'm a charismatic like im astonic
we treat a vinyed like a foreward hydraulics (??)

all across the nation we celebrated
second CD, highly anticipate it, glad you waited
now its on, its the full swing
sizin up the powers like a fighter in a bull ring
my music is bumpin, and now they jumpin like a checker
and I got the feelin that im a sell a million records
but even if I don't im a keep my head high, stickin out my chest
cuz I know I did my best
flow lyr'ally precisely, beats laid nicely
now playa haters wanna excise me (??)
but don't hate me cuz God is blessin me
and no im not a monk so ain't no need in testin me
I'm testin the the mic just to see if its too loud
1 2, 1 2, let it to adjust the crowd
God Saved them, I think we gave 'em what they came for
now in pandemonium they beggin for an encore
