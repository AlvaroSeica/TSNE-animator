Since we've seen each other, a game goes on.
Secretly I move, and you respond.
You're winning, you think it's funny.
But look up from the board now (1984: Quatrain 1245).

[Kevlaar 7]
Prevention of ascension, lyrically hesitant to mention
The wackest lines that you regret written visions and mental missions
Got a nigga waiting, decisions, decisions
Hip-Hop religion risen, 50-50 5th and 26 shine spitting
40 million winning, where youthful children sinning
Beginning like tin man, breathing 43rd win
The unburden flaming niggas that burn men
Reaffirm men, the churning cauldron that hauls men and women
To Hip-Hop's fields of killing
Scalpel like voice, heavy enough to smash big buildings

"Just came back from the dead tonight"

[Bronze Nazareth]
I blaze electromagnetic phonetic, my grip is like pathogens
My cell's multiplying, your cycle of Circadian rhythms
Molest the zip code, number two pencil execution
Cross your fulvic, nomad, lungs sucking up nitrogen
Perpendicular era of conspiracy in the Unknown
I sharpen my erection; harpoon you through your pubic bones
Warlord invulnerable to the violently state of alum that digest a napalm
Disen and Amen-Ra, infamous Sun God
I travel at the speed of shadows, bloodier than medieval battles
And adversaries who impose entity get roped on the gallows
I pull energy through radioactive ways that slay royal graves
Striving off poison increase and lyrical Gamma-rays
Sentenced by the 42 Judges in the halls of Osiris
To read the book of the dead and spread it immortal white cell virus
Thieving my resent from the dynasties within
Strong as Teutonic Knights in the hypnotic Nordic region

"If that Doctor must come" "I'll fight it"

[Kevlaar 7]
Verbal genetics, energy tongue kinetic
They awfully fed it with germs, alphabetic
Letters insulin, diabetic, the English tagnet
No need for the medics, in the past I bled it
Hell yeah my taste buds can smell it
The lyrical relic wakes up every night rested
Uncontested, even when it's silent
Careful though my gums tote lyrical guns
Heavy ass ones shooting over ducking tongue
Bouncing off any ammo, teeth is white shrapnel
I spit out a handful, bullets and broken teeth distasteful
Disgraceful rivals, liable to make atheist emcees pull out Bible

"You want a war you can't win?"

[Bronze Nazareth]
Yo, I crack, pseudo alumni, manifested by 2045
And bomb the Sun that'll rise like lethal sedative
Rotate 2000 meters per second squared on an axis
Vespula Yellow jackets swarm, sting with needles of pure lead
Snap your shinbone, lying in dark crevices like crackheads
Writing hazardous, cuneiform, and hieroglyphical
Biblical scriptures that has minds blown
Thunder storming from the dome and fueling from the dark
That drowns Earth and recreates Noah's Ark
Spark from the cutaneous brain tissue
Word's so strong they shoot back through time and slice Jesus' umbilical
No escaping this, treacherousness
I've walked a quarter Earth with bloody fist
Breathing Primatene mint; a third wish from the Genie lamp
Can't reduce my verbal cramp nor menstruation
Might take form of an axe, laceration
Not the type of nigga to raise Hell, but I'll lower Heaven
Shattering mics and killing niggas with my brethren</pre>
