[Left Brain]
Yo, just finished hitting these bitches and now I'm dippin
This barbecue sauce on my fried chicken
Am I trippin? I said that backwards
I rock my hat backwards, I'm on the beat, my swagger's dapper
Don't call me Dan, just cause I break down the weed
and wrap trees with my fam, don't mean I got wrapper hands
But I'd slap a fan quickly - and I mean real quickly
Lube her up, do her up, that's what I call a quickie
Fuckin faggot fan in the audience wanna diss me
I met his goofy ass backstage and I beat him pissy
His girlfriend was a witness, I said "Look missy
Don't say a word and umm... pass the ciggy
or a stogie, cause I got the greens and
I got the rollies and we can get high and
I can treat you like Kobe, or Ghosty
Cause I'll fuckin vanish if you wanna fuckin panic
I'm the pussy bandit"

[Chorus]
We rollin up the la, la, la, la, la-la-la-la-la
We rollin up the la, la, la, la, la-la-la-la-la
Is he rollin up a la, la, la, la, la-la-la-la-la?
Nigga we rollin up a la, la, la-la-la-la
Smokin up the la, la, la-la-la-la
We gettin high off the la, la, la-la-la-la
We so fly off the la, la, la-la-la-la
Come and buy a la, la, la-la-la-la (ay, Wolf Gang)

There's two girls I'm in the middle in my black Continental
No - it isn't a rental so we gon' have to be gentle
She's arrested by my genitals, like a fuckin criminal
Felony after felony what her priors are tellin me
She wearing all spandex, light shirt
I finna go Nutty Professor in her bloody old dress
Don't scream but hold them signs up, protest the
WNBA bouncin balls covering her breast up
Girl what's up with your friend on the left?
I'ma have to go get, get it in on the left
Snip and trim on the left, slim skin on the left
She got a twin on the left, we were hikin up the canyon
I'm pullin out my canon, showin her mt=y main companion
Cause soon eggs scramblin, and then a nigga scrammin
And you can't hold me back, Space Jammin
Two three's, weak balls, she eat balls, meatballs
