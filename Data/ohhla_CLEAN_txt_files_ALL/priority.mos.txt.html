[Mos Def]
Top priority
Peace before everything, God before anything
Love before anything, real before everything
Home before anyplace, shoot before anything
Style and state radiate
Love power slay the hate
Truth killer flaky face
Players say it to they face
Ain't afraid to major straight
Race at the table straight
Flow greatest like the greatest lakes
Capes all greatest states 
Quiet water major waves
Steer the course, make a way
And come ashore on a greater day
Home grown from the greatest grain
Full flavor in the native strain
Now put that on your brainy brain
Full exposure to favorite slang
Minimal wage and major gangs
Y'all seen ? to the bait
Later night from day to day they came to play 
You came to stay, get out the way
Be-otch sons buy heat rocks
Brooklyn finest, preservation to beat-box!
Front a ?full poison? to detox
When we rock the people I respond: priority
Peace before anything, God before everything
Love before anything, real before everything
Home before anyplace, shoot before anything
Style and state radiate, love power slay the hate
Priority!
Love power...</pre>
