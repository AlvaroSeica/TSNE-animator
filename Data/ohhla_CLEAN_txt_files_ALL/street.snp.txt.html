[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Don't let this street life get ya down
Don't let this street life run you around

[Snoop Doggy Dogg]
Since I was young I grew up in the street life
Times get hard for a gangsta in the street life
Ain't no tellin what my life might be like
Growin up in the street life

You can't tell me shit, about these streets homie
I done lived it and done it, runnin from the police
Out for the money, homies maintain their composure
Now that we older we sellin ki's by the doja
Now I'm a soldier motherfucker for the chips wanna dip to trip
Headed straight for D.C., down for D.P.
Flipped the script and came equipped with some riders who got my back
Snoop Corleone, you know I'm always down to jack
I jack for instant thought, talkin walk the walk
Niggaz who oppose automatically get stomped
Terrorizing the neighborhood niggaz gainin they grab me
Southside and dash, mashin for the rep
Test in peace to deceased homeboys who ain't alive
Street life took him over now he forced to die
Slippin and slidin, bouncin countin my ends
to be straight, times is ruff for these days
Niggaz is crazy, but the fear is much greater
The innovater, dominator, soul creator, out for the papers!
Since I was young I grew up in the street life

[2Pac]
Bustin and balin, thugs addicted to drug sellin ki's
Got me riskin, living the street, catch a felony
How many niggaz wanna see me gone?
You bitches is playa haters who hate to see a nigga hold his own
Forever ballin and never fallin
Live my life as a thug, now can you hear the liquor callin
When we blaze niggaz is blinded
My competition is minimal so I live, criminal minded
Nigga can you hear me wave yo' pistols in the sky
and roll a fat-ass blunt, I bet that shit will get you high
They wonder why I'm hard to kill, hard to let go
How can I die and leave my peers on Death Row
Don Makaveli, 45, tattoo my belly
Conversating wit my nigga Dogg, lyrics so deadly
When ya come to get me bring an army
An Outlaw motherfucker, who can harm me
Bomb the clip and see the track smokin
cause real Bad Boy killers be them gat toters
Ha ha, open ya eyes and understand me
World ain't fair these motherfuckers doin scandalous see
Niggaz don't wanna see me hot with my glock cocked
Drinkin on Henn', screamin fuck the world this is the end
in the street life!

[Chorus] - 6X</pre>
