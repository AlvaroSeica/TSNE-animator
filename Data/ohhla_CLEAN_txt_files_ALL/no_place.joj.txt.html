[JoJo Pellegrino]
There's no place like home
I hear these rappers talkin that bullshit, I'm laughing to death
Cuz they ain't got enough hair on they chest
I'm from a place where you're probably with your fam on the stoop of the projects
Your rap hollow tips will air out your flesh
Step in the hood, you're left where you're stood when people pass
Out here they chop you to pieces like a Primo sample
Cats skip thanks, Goodfella ranks, push caddy tanks
Staten Island got it's on Yanks, holla back young'n
This where' the daughters rap cousin, PJs death traps
Run for your dear life when the brolic gat's thumping
It's the place I call home
It's wear I hang my hat, rest my head and steam bone
I wouldn't trade it for nothing, these fuckin faggots tryin to rap like me
Who put it on the map like me? Beef, I hope you strapped like me
It's the Pellegrino zone, Italian rap, South Shore stuff
I own, I tell ya boy, there's no place like home, come on

[Chorus: Sample with JoJo sayin 'There's no place like home']

[JoJo Pellegrino]
Ayo I live in Grey Kills, where cops be watching
Grew up in a block where million dollar yachts be docking
And there's armored chairs in every bag of tron we sparking
I take detours, know the spots narcs be parked in
It's three sixty for o, murder is one twenty
For regulars, little spiked hair guinnes cattered to cellulars
But the plan is heavyweight, generate in every state
Show a down payment on a two family and renovate
Everything you need is here, picket fence, yard, pool, patio with chairs
The birds sing at night around here
Truly it's beauty, the perfect in environment to raise children
Or be a hustler, choosin a living, seclusion and made millions
Call it Paradise Slums, nicknamed it Baby Brooklyn
Pizza taste like you died and went to heaven
They the grounds I miss when I roam, and inspire me to flip when I'm flowin
SI, there's no place like home, come on

[Chorus]

[JoJo Pellegrino]
Yeah, yo, I don't be stepping out of character
South Shore's livest, flash in a weapon like a camera
Clean up guy like the janitor, you ain't a customer or a man of my calibur
Dismantle your algebra, picture me handing the crown to ya, nodice
Antonio and Delini split your zuchini
When the heat's drawn it turns your meatball to linguini
Take that, politicin over pastries and sellers
Got a goomba to talk for me like Paulie from Goodfellas
Can't speak to me direct, look, see me with a check or hear me with a tec
Stop being stupid, treat me with respect
These here are the codes that you follow where I live at
You feed your legal mouthpiece and go and get that
Lemon ice chicks for the right chips will let you hit that
You front, the middleman will sense that and push your shit back
Land in a calzone, you can smell a dump in a fourteen mile zone
It's fresh air to me, no place like home, come on

[Chorus]</pre>
