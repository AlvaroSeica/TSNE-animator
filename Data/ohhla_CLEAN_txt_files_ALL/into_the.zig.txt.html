Song:   Into the Groove
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Into the groove, where we lose ourselves just to find who we are
into the groove, where we get to fly but we need not see the sky
into the groove, where we escape from the surface of what we've become
into the groove, come for the ride

Take the plunge, soak it up like a sponge
don't be afraid of tonight, everything is gonna be alright
take the plunge, soak me up like a sponge
don't be afraid of the light, everything is gonna be just fine

Into the groove, where love grows to new heights
into the groove, where the sun disappears but a light still shines
into the groove, surrounded by the waters of desire, yeah
into the groove, come for the ride

Catch the wave, free the slave, emancipate your mind
cause nothing men do can change this time
catch the wave (I'm gonna catch the wave), and free your slave (I'm gonna free my slave)
emancipate your mind, hey nothin' they do can change this time

Light it up

Into the groove, where we lose ourselves just to find who we are
into the groove, where we get to fly but we need not see the sky
into the groove, where we escape from the surface of what we've become
into the groove, come for the ride

Yeah, come for the ride</pre>
