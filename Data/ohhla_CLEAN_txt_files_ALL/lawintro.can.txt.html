Welcome to Canibus Catalogue dot com
Thank you for your purchase
It's because of commited souls, just like you
all over the world, that this is even possible

One of the bonus discs is gonna be a surprise

from 1993, for an album I made, titled "Lyrical Warfare"
with a group called THEM
That's right, The Heralds of Extreme Metaphors
Also, I'd like to say thank you to the designers of this site
