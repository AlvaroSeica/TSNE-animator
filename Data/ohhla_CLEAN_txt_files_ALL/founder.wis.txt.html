[Intro: Salute]
Word... king perfect..
Salute the Kid.. Wisemen, niggas
We here, niggas...

[Chorus: Kevlaar 7]
In stages hunger comes faceless, Purple Haze
One miss step my pagers aimless, I die ageless
The movement need a facelift in these days when
Death is where the days went and life climbs from the basement

[Salute]
I'm a comet, like the world eclipse
I'm into ghetto chicks, drama queens, asses and hips
Hard to move when you waken everyday to a ship
Through the struggle old bitch, I just focus and lift
My knuckles bleed, fingers feel they bitten by frost
How can life be the price when the death is the cost?
Hard to settle for a win without accepting the loss
Only future to a pirate is becoming the boss
But these are the days of our lives 'cause the world don't stop
Fuck a bitch man, I married a block
All I need is some rocks in the low-key spot
Black hood fucker suit, best man be the glock
'Cause niggas rocking suits fam is stiff in the box
And I ain't going out like that for the Wisemen to watch
I got two daughters to watch, two daughters to feed
Plus my mind frame is crazy and I'm down for my team
I'ma get it how I live it, while y'all pay homage
If it's death, I ain't scared 'cause this life ain't promised
Way ahead of my time like a premi' at birth
With the keys to the lock of a permanent curse

[Chorus]

[Outro: Salute]
Yeah, word up...
Watch yourself...
K7, nigga...
Salute the Kid...</pre>
