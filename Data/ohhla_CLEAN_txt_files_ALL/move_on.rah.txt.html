Song:   Move On, Elevate
Typed by: Quest Rah

Big city life
Big brick kid with the knife
Cold gritty fight
Think quick you might lose ya life
Room kinda tight
Mans waste from another night
Keep lips tight
Say a word now you're in a fight
Cram packed train bodies carried to a 9-5
Concrete sheep graze fields spending all their pie
Oxford street shop lights got a shopper hype
Back to the system thru the credit card money swipe
Exchange digits real money is an alibi
Glitz glamour life
Tushy-whipped city slicker type
Sunglass wearin playboy wit the bling ride
Fat cats eat interest like a meat pie
City dwellers pay interest to the suit and tie
Minds violated like afghan woman's rights
Some false dream realize and make it out the pile
Some holdin on like a lost mother with her child
Move on, elevate, move on, elevate, move on, elevate, move on, elevate
Some aim at the brain wit the chains of lock down
Silhouette shadow street corners of each town
Mans get reps from fame on blocks round
Skulls hit kerbs aftermath gunshots sound
Exchange palms got love for fam now but
Cane juks abel when the paper comes round
Eyes entertained big screens where most bound
Front page bulletin rage on stocks down
You must be scared lock ya doors leave no sound
Young men crave crazed girls like dogs hound
Crazed girls walk tip toe sidewalk clowns
Most haven't seen over walls in compounds
Estate blocks grey rocks where most drown
Sun light blocked by the moving of grey clouds
my heart still pumps so walk to that sound
I want in, don't stand in the way of my crown</pre>
