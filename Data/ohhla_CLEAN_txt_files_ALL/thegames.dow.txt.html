[Mr. Shadow]
Yeah (Yeah)
Shadow (Shadow)
I'm sick and tired of all these wannabes in this motherfuckin' game
Ha ha
God damnit (Yeah)
Understand
Only two misters (Only two)
Motherfucker
Shadow and Lil' (Check this shit out)
Check it out
Hold back

[Verse 1]
The game's flooded
Time to do somethin' about it
I'm Dego's most wanted
Cali's most blunted
I'm just a main man
Your bitch is screaming out my name
And you hate that (Shadow!)
You motherfucker
When you see me in the streets, I'll be surrounded by thugs
Making a livin' out of slangin'
Guns and drugs
It was a neighborhood thang, and it still is, homey
A.P.K. to the grave, I creep slowly
Duck if you don't know me
I ain't playin'
Shadow
Westside insane, San Diego
Make no mistake and it'll be all right
I'm Amichi Park bangin', all day and night
I'll make a microphone smoke like a .454
Sit back and chug a whole pound of that hydro
The way I rolls on 24"s
Navigatin' for you hatin' hoes and holsters

Chorus:
[Mr. Shadow] The game's flooded
             Put your long-johns on
             All you minor league rappers are begging to bring it on
             The game's flooded
             Haters don't get far
[E-Dubb]     "Listen to the words of the M-R" --&gt; Mr. Shadow
[Mr. Shadow] The game's flooded
             It goes down like this
             Goldfish and pirannahs don't mix, motherfucker
             The game's flooded
             Haters don't get far
[E-Dubb]     "Listen to the words of the M-R"

[Verse 2]
I spit flame so hot, it'll melt your frame
You know the name of the one who came to change the game
I'm insane
And fame ain't shit to me
I'm a twelve gauge, blastin' through the industry (Yeah)
Silly ass actors
Wannabe rappers
They're only two misters
Phonies get slapped up
You'll never catch up, haven't you heard?
I flip a track, flip the script and still flip a bird
Yeah, I puttin' in work
You'll get yourself hurt
You ain't afraid to get paid, hell naw, we do dirt
We stay G-A-N-G
Ster/Stur
Watch as I swerve and get my splurge
E-Dubb loco (What)
He'll put you in a chokehold
I got venomous vocals
All my nemesis crash and burn
When they see me comin', they flip U-turns
They know

Repeat Chorus</pre>
