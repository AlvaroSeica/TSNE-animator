"I want you to know that
I can't let you go" --&gt; Linda Jones

[Lil Rob {Moox}]
Damn, baby
If only we had met just a little bit sooner
Then you wouldn't have to deal with that guy
You know what I mean {"I know" --&gt; Linda Jones}
Yeah

[Lil Rob]
(Verse 1)
Hey, I don't know him
I don't like him, been hurting you for quite some time
How could you be a sad girl when you're so fine
Get that fool off your mind (Get that fool off your mind)
I know, that I can do you better than he can (Better than he can)
I may not wear no diamond rings
And I might not sport a bunch of fancy things
But there's one thing that I know
That I can do you better than he can
Now I don't mean to interfere
If you wanted to, I'll respect you and stay clear
It's just I know
That I can do you better than he can
So if you got nothin' to do
You wanna try someone new, let me be the one you look to
Because I know
That me and you can ourselves a lot of fun this weekend

Chorus: Moox
"If only (Oh, baby, baby, baby, baby)
We had met sooner
We should have met sooner
If only (Darling, darling, darling, darling)
We had met sooner (Sooner)" --&gt; Linda Jones

(Verse 2)
You ain't next to him, when you should be laying next to me
Guess I gotta pay the agony
If I wanna have your ecstacy
I know, that I can do you better than he can
It can't be hard to take his place
Let me know if I'm out of place, like the smile on your pretty face
I know
That I can do you better than he can
Let me turn your frown around
I mean, upside down, pick you up and
All he does is let you down
I know, that I can do you better than he can
You really got nothing to lose
Make that fool old news, let me be the one you choose
Because I know
That he's been treating you like you're not even breathin'

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 3)
How could you let him do
All them things that he does to you (What he does to you)
Hey, come on girl, you know that love ain't true
I know, that I can do you better than he can
I mean, what's he got that I don't got
Besides that big ass pad and that Benz on twenty-fours in the parking lot
Shit
I can still do you better than he can
See, I saw you crack a smile
When's the last time you made him smile
Baby doll, I know it's been a while
I know, that I can do you better than he can
You really got nothing to lose
Make that fool old news, let me be the one you choose
Because I know
That you should leave him and don't even give him a reason

Repeat Chorus

[Moox]
