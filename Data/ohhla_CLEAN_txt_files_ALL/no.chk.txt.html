Yeah some of y'all flip like wills never got
What we gon do right here is go back
Waaay back
Back into rhyme

We gonna do a song that you never heard before

NO comeback stories NO corny
Choruses No glories NO hallelujahs
NO landcruisers NO drug users
NO grins NO trends
NO phony azz friends
Who begin wit ends and end wit NO ends
And NO estrogen
NO gassups NO soups NO lexcoups
NO crackers NO backers NO niggas
For the blackers NO triple teams
NO mainstream dreams
NO stress beams NO accusations
Cop chases or court cases
NO rape charges NO sarges NO DeBarges
NO lightweight bouts, up in the air
Shoot outs and NO sellouts
NO negros with egos NO mo shows
Callin women bitches and hoes
NO thoughtless flows NO woes
NO singin voices NO Rolls Royces
NO wack choices
NO volunteers getting peers of career
Years
NO solutions NO problems
NO more vinyl revolving
NO happy campers NO offense
NO funk samples

The easiest and the hardest word to say is NO
Only got two letters
Only takes a second to say it
NO meanin No
NO contest NO stress
NO second guessin
NO body guards
NO question
The easiest and the hardest word to say is NO
Only got two letters
Only takes a second to say it
NO meanin No
NO contest NO stress
NO second guessin

NO suckertash
NO girl I got the cash raps
NO sex traps
NO Rolexes NO unprotected sexes
NO false hopes
NO hand ropes boats NO car notes
NO killers NO vanilla
NO bigger willies NO Wilmas
NO jail time NO fuckin lil kid rhymes
NO studio terrors NO mirrors
Look ma NO spelling errors
NO absent pops, NO sweatshops
NO pork chops
NO justice NO peace NO please please please
NO legal freestyles NO willies, NO
McCovey
NO industry rapes, capes NO suits NO
Ties
NO stars NO over paid A&amp;R's
NO body guards gold teeth
NO east coast, west coast beefs
NO dumb looks, NO one sided books
NO special cooks NO finesse NO mess NO struggle to progress
NO hittin sprees NO HIV NO lies
From NO TV's
NO contracts NO tracks with NO mechanicals
