[Gunfire and screaming]

[Misdemeanor]

Ah shit!  That's the way to do it!
A 187 on 6th &amp; Baronne!

[Dispatcher]

187 on 6th &amp; Baronne, please send emergency units

First Verse [Misdemeanor]:

I ain't no joke with that gat smoke,
Quick to bust your cantaloupe,
Murder ain't shit when I'm full off that indo,
See a victim watch me creep,
Gotta put his ass to sleep,
Caught him right, caught him right, nigga I ain't nothin' nice,
Murder is a hobby, them laws they can't fade me,
Bust me, frame me, them niggas must be crazy,
Ever go to jail, I make bail, I'm too large,
(Cuz they can't hold a gangsta on a misdemeanor charge)
Then I'm back on the streets, and that's it Black for the 9-4,
Knockin' niggas off, fuckin' over five oh,
Hittin' hustles, robbin' niggas, back to all that old shit,
Slangin' coke, snortin' dope, it's all about my money BIATCH!!!!!

Chorus [Partners-N-Crime]:

One eightyyy, one eighty seven   (187 ain't nothin' but a misdemeanor)
One eightyyy, one eighty seven   (187 ain't nothin' but a misdemeanor)
So if you niggas wanna step I'll send your ass to Hell,
A misdemeanor ain't nothin' but a 187,
So if you niggas wanna step I'll send your ass to Hell,
A misdemeanor ain't nothin' but a 187

Second Verse [Prime Time]:

Life is short, you'll never catch this nigga here, with his pants down,
Ain't nobody fightin', grab my strap, put your hands down,
Niggas boogie bang, blood spills as I pass by,
Who want, that nigga in the ski mask, go breeze by,
Rollin' through your hood, my passenger's a plum,
Fool silence if I hear a pin drop I'ma dump,
I peel a nigga's shit, straight makin' fools splatter,
Pissin' fools off like my name was blat-blatta,
It don't matter,
Shouldn't have stared but now you covered up in plastic,
Stretched like elastic, but call me sarcastic,
Cuz murder ain't a thang, ain't no shame, fuck a Kris Kross,
The price to play the game is heavy, life is what the shit costs,
I get lost, with po po's, bailin' with they gats out,
A lot of niggas creep, tryin' to run, with they backs out,
I keep my bitch Niener on my side, have you seen her?
Murder is a way of life fool, 187 is a misdemeanor

Chorus
