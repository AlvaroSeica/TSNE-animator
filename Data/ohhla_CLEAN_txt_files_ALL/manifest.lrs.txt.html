Song:   Manifest Destiny
Typed by: @mc_lars (Horris Records)

Lars:
Welcome to the Wild Wild West
Pecos Lars won't hesitate to put a slug in your chest
Hard rhymer, 49-er, got my Remington Cocked
I shot a man in Reno just to hear his heart stop (stop)

YTCracker:
manifest destiny was the slogan
in the 1800s when the east was all broken
people sought their riches in a vicious move west
and the competition kept 'em on their toes with no rest

Lars:
Posting up at my homestead got my gold bars stacked
Go west, manifest destiny is on track
Forging streams, so it seems, in my heavy covered wagon
You can't stop it, Davy Crocket, all the crazy fun we're having

YTCracker:
in the mid 90s people started forging the framework
of the modern day internet and pioneered the game work
I was on the front lines lewis and clark
with a slip connection wrecking on the net in the dark

Chorus
manifest destiny a motto of progress
but it isn't always positive the aftermath regardless
eventually theres casualty  but it doesnt matter see
'Cause everyone is ultimately out for themselves
manifest destiny a motto of progress
but it isn't always positive the aftermath regardless
eventually there's casualty  but it doesn't matter see
'Cause everyone is ultimately out for themselves

Lars:
I get crunk!
Shooting Indians, straight out pillagin'
One day we'll put a Wal-Mart here and make those millions
Small pox on the blankets killing buffalo for fun
The white man is more heinous than Attila the Hun!

YTCracker:
was an outlaw sticking up the internet train
I took that superhighway and I made it a game
felt at home on the range I'm an agent of change
I'm the internet obama if it needed a name

Lars:
Pochantis, girl you want this, brace yourself like orthodontists
Because High Noon is coming soon like Jesse James you'll never stop us
Just Andy Milonakis eating everything in sight
We sleep with one eye open on these cold Nevada nights!

YTCracker:
I was spamming mails like it was oregon trails
die of sickness from the dysentery making my sales
holy grails of the internet partner knew 'em all
smuggling my warez with a howdy yall
