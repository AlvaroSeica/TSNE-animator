Song:   Across the Universe
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Speech]
Words are flying out
Like endless rain into a paper cup
They slither while they pass
They slip away, across the universe
Pools of sorrow, waves of joy
are driftin thorough my open mind
Possessing and caressing me

[Chorus]
Jai Guru-oooh, Deva, Ohmmmmmm
Nothing's gonna change my world {*4X*}

[Speech]
Images of broken light
Which dance before me like a million eyes
They call me on and on
Across the universe
Thoughts meander like a restless wind
Inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way
Across the universe

[Chorus]

[Speech]
Sounds of laughter, shades of life
Are ringing through my open ears
Exciting and inviting me
In-vi-ting
Limitless undying love
Which shines around me like a million suns
It calls me on and on
Across the universe

[Chorus]</pre>
