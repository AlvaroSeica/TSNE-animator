[Krizz Kaliko]
See it's gon be a lil different tonight
I think I'm a bag me a stripper tonight
You might think it's funny, but I don't
Want me to spend some money, but I won't
She said, "I love it when you touching me"
It's twenty bucks but you get one for free
Let's sneak off and get it on
Do it for they end of song
And do what you want to do to me

[Chorus: x2]
She told me to do it
(do it like you do it, do it)
Doing it till you get off
Baby that's how I get off

She told me to do it
(Do it like you do it, do it)
Girl you gotta take it off
Baby let me break you off

She told me to do it
(Do it like you do it, do it)
Doing it till you get off
Baby that's how I get off

She told me to do it
Take me, take me
You saying my name
Mama I'm doing the same
Until we get off

[Tech N9ne]
We were out on the town
Woman that's grill we throwing down
Have corn fallas and columbia winery reasoning
We swolling now
Baby girl wanna take me home
I put the flow with your music and a/c on
I'm a tell her that she made me pumped
And getting me horny enough to make me bone
When I got to the crib nigga it was poppin, no stoppin
On the couch to the floor then the steps and the feeling was shockin, bunnocking
Then my door bell rang (ding-dong)
I really want somebody to leave me long
But it was the next door neighbor with a bb on
Maybe we can get a threebee on
She said to me "could you keep it down a lil bit
You two got my bedroom shakin I can really feel it
Would you like another girl
Does your girl like other girls
If so I know this here will take you to another world"
Came in and we're right to it
Didn't have to caribou lou it</pre>
