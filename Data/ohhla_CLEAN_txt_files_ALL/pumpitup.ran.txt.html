[Intro]
Dah dah dahh dah
Dah dah dahh dah
Dah dah dahh dah, yeah, yeah~!
Dah dah dahh dah, yeah, yeah~!
Uhh, let's go

[Random] + (Adam WarRock)
Me and WarRock keep it movin like the floor's hot
Don't quit your day job (you might get a tour slot)
See those dudes rollin up, we don't move
Man the flow's crazy, three-oh-two'd
(Foolish!) Parker Lewis, cause he don't lose
Skills don't equal murders or kilos moved
Guess I'm statin the obvious (he probably is)
Since oh-seven been floodin the net like a tsunami hit
So put your hand up (turn it to a fist)
Take the other hand clamp it around your wrist
then charge up and blast on a wannabe
The white Howard in the post cause it's foolish to front on me
Otaku like pocky and Ramane
Never take a day off (not even bank holidays)
So what you got is a problem, I'm tellin y'all
The blue bomber and the man with the yellow scarf

[Chorus 2X: Adam WarRock] + (Mega Ran)
You got the sickness, we're bringin the cure
We blast it out of your speakers until it's shakin the floor
{PUMP ME UP!} (Cause I'm focused more than ever before)
(You know we ready for war, we gotta settle the score) {PUMP ME UP!}

[Adam WarRock] + (Random)
The Proto Man to your Mega Ran came to lend a hand
Adam is ready and willin, to fight the villain
Cause it seems that machines is failin, society needs savin
You feelin good Ran? (I feel amazing)
So if Wily approaches Light, if Proto Man joins the fight
then there's nothing they can't do to stop this blight
It's like Random and WarRock, you're lovin the sound
We make you throw your hands up and wave 'em around
Cause I'm feedin off your energy, battlin back the enemies
Knowin I got the tendency to rock this stage
And I'm seekin out the remedy, Mega Ran in the meantime
got the sick skills enough to beat this game (woo~!)
Yeah, that's our cause, and we standin on the platform
While listeners ask for me to rap more so man
If I'm so amazing, GEEZ!
Must be why Mega Ran got me on this beat

[Chorus]

[Adam W] Aiyyo Ran
[Mega R] Whattup Adam?
[Adam W] Stop the track for a second
Gotta reset my game back it up for a second
Cause it feels like I died like a million times
tryin to get through the level
[Mega R] It's like you're readin my mind
Because I struggled to find, a combination of lines
There went the beat
[Adam W] Sometimes, y'know it's harder to find
So when you call me back to fight right along at your side
Happy to take up the cause, so haters they better hide
[Mega R] Yeah, got the elixir to fix ya, the spine twister
[Adam W] It's goin down
[Mega R] Like the Catalina wine mixer
We rock steady, they +Raven+ like +Scott Levy+
I say that you not ready, I'm from where they chop Chevys
and bounce 'em like bad checks, Comic Con to MagFest
[Adam W] Mad fresh
[Mega R] Spittin these rhymes can cure bad breath
[Adam W] Halitosis?
[Mega R] Expiali-dopeness
Focus, stoppin somethin this explosive is hopeless

[Chorus]

[Random]
Uh-oh... you got 'em?
Let's go

[Adam W] I'm pullin end to end burners on the walls of his room
So Pump Man's all distracted with a mop and a broom
[Mega R] Yo he's a neat freak!
[Adam W] I see that Ran, how mean I am
Down gutter and dirty when I'm rockin it too
SO PUMP IT UP~! I got a full life bar
And wonderful weapons to try to fight hard, back against this Light boss
Wipe off the mess
[Mega R] Cause we're back on the scene
[Adam W] Washin 'em down the drain, so fresh and so clean
[Mega R] Yeah, it's time to figure this sickness and what caused it
Next in my target is this leaky faucet
Pump Man need to know somethin I ain't never been a punk man
Now you out of tune like a stumped band
You got my back Proto?
[Adam W] Man that's a given
[Mega R] Cool, lay down some fire while I get into position
Equippin the Thunder Wool so I can light up his life
I'm in need of a challenge, "This was hardly a fight!"</pre>
