Be strong!

[Verse 1]
Damn man, it's always somethin
If it ain't the phone, then the door's buzzin
If they're not in school, they on the corners hustlin
All these criminals that the law is bustin
Crime don't stop, all good and all is sudden
They was so cool, they used to say they cousins
Went to the same school, even played the dozens
Y'all was just boys, now they say they wasn't
Need to mind my own, solve other people's problems
Fix theirs, but mine? I don't speak about em
Low key, I try to be a private person
Smile all day, show no signs of hurtin
Who am I tryin to fool? Things keep weighin on me
If it's not me, who's gonna say it for me?
Gotta let it out, puttin up a shield isn't
Me not dealin with it's how I deal with it
And that's wrong...

[Chorus]
If you feel like you've been through alot and held it inside
You might need a shoulder to cry
If you had your head up, but now you have trouble holding it high
You might need a shoulder to cry
If you feel left alone after someone close to you died
You might need a shoulder to cry
If you feel nothing works, no matter how hard you've tried
You might need a shoulder to cry

[Verse 2]
You don't get a break from drama
Seeing how the angels came to take your Mama
Took your father early, could've waited longer
Didn't make you stronger, just made you ponder
What you here for? Yesterday you got fired
Car repossessed, can't control your baby brother
Seen him arrest, beef with his baby mother
How your nieces rest? Mailbox stays cluttered
But never see a check
Many men, but they don't know how to be direct
Play games on your ex you gotta see for sex
Friends got drama too, so they need advice
Never ask what's up with you, so you be uptight
Have your own (?), that you had it on
Never put yourself first, so it has you torn
Flashbacks of your folks, so you're sad and mourn
The only ones you had close, and that you had are gone...

[Chorus]
If you feel like you've been through alot and held it inside
You might need a shoulder to cry
If you had your head up, but now you have trouble holding it high
You might need a shoulder to cry
If you feel left alone after someone close to you died
You might need a shoulder to cry
If you feel nothing works, no matter how hard you've tried
You might need a shoulder to cry

[Bridge]
If you can't find the happiness that you were hoping to find
You can use my shoulder to cry
If you feel everyone's against you, and no one's on your side
You can use my shoulder to cry
If you feel there's nothing you can do except run and hide
YOu can use my shoulder to cry
If you're hurt deep down and try to smile on the outside
You can use my shoulder to cry

[Verse 3]
Need a shoulder? Use mine
On the verge of burstin if you didn't cry
It's just a shirt, it'll dry
Headin towards self-destruction, might help discussin
With other people cause your dealt with your self-reluctance
May you find a substance, or a (?)
Your mind is sufferin
But on the whole, you're wasting time frontin
You had it all together
But it fell apart
What's right in your mind your heart can't tell apart
Moves that you had to make, you would've made different
Routes that you had to take, you had no say in it
How it is, is gonna be how it's gonna be
But you don't wanna see that, cause you don't agree
It's still there, holdin back won't get it over
I'm here, so lower your head down on my shoulder
Try to fake it and go on, but you can't because
It's hard to cry on someone else's when the world's on yours...

[Chorus]
If you feel like you've been through alot and held it inside
You might need a shoulder to cry
If you had your head up, but now you have trouble holding it high
You might need a shoulder to cry
If you feel left alone after someone close to you died
You might need a shoulder to cry
If you feel nothing works, no matter how hard you've tried
You might need a shoulder to cry</pre>
