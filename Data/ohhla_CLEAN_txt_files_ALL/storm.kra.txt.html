[Jay-Z]
"You gotta let this one breathe Just"....
....."Just let it breathe for a second."

"JUST BLAZE!"

[Lenny Kravitz]
My life has taken me beyond the planets and the stars
And you're the only one that could take me this far
I'll be forever searching for your love
I walked away but I was wrong
You're the one that keeps me strong
You're the fire that keeps me warm
How will I get through this storm?
At night, I pray before I sleep in hope of finding you
I've opened up my heart, I want you to come through
I close my eyes, I'm searching for your love
I walked away but I was wrong
You're the one that keeps me strong
You're the fire that keeps me warm
How will I get through this storm?

[Jay-Z]
"Yes, Yes"
"I got the bounce Lenny"
"Check me out"

Brooklyn's Bad Boy back again
Feet hit the ground running and my back's to the wind
Angels on my shoulders, head in the clouds
No I'm not rapping I'm just thinking real loud
My Karma's my armor, my charm and wit
is like a leather bomber I'm warm and shit
and I did bad for good but when you're trapped in the hood
you do worse for less homie earth's a test
Only God can judge me, my heart ain't ugly
But the thoughts that I drop is heavy, try to budge me
Momma loved me, Pop left me
Still the homies call me lucky lefty 					
Im flashy and deadly, deceptively smart
I make hustlin' heaven and pimping a art
Long as I know that I'm blessed and Im loved in depth
I can walk through water and not get wet, Im that fresh!

[Lenny Kravitz]
I walked away but I was wrong
You're the one that keeps me strong
You're the fire that keeps me warm
How will I get through this storm?

[Jay-Z]
There you have it
Young hov, Lenny Kravitz
Not your average
Get your umbrella
It's raining macs and broads
all grace to god

[Lenny Kravitz]
I walked away but I was wrong
You're the one that keeps me strong
You're the fire that keeps me warm
How will I get through this storm?
