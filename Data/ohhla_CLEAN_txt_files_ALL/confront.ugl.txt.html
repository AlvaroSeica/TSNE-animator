Excuse me, I'm looking for the manager
Oh, excuse me, may I speak with you please?

(Well, look, it's Brianna, nature's little gem)
Some customers came in and said that you insulted them (Uh huh)
At my place of business
(The Veggie Hut) That's right
(Well, listen, it's a free country and I'll say what I like)
Why the negativity, you need positive energy
(As you can see I'm busy, it would help if you didn't pester me)
Then don't put down my people
(Oh, who, you mean those frail chicks
and sissy guys who bat their eyes chewing on your trail mix?)
Well, what about your nasty food?
(Eat it) Hey, forget that!
(What) Give me a wet nap and then I'll leave this death trap
(People love Meatshake, a kid or an adult
They want a good meal, they don't want to join your cult)
Umm, that's because they're stupid, lazy and inactive (uh huh)
Dull and unattractive (yeah) living like a fat pig
(At least they're not new age crystal loving psychos
who "Follow where the light goes," wearing little tight clothes)
Good release that anger, I see you're too uptight, come and get a bran muffin
(Yeah, not on your life) Hey!
(Your food is too expensive and I wouldn't even get full)
Can you put a price on your body and your soul?
(Look, I'll keep eating meat, and you do what you do)
Tell me, what an animal has ever done to you?
(Hehe, tt filled me up--) with blood and guts
(Hey, save the attack) I guess I just respect life
(I have it for a snack)
Well, the least that you can do (Yeah) is offer us a garden plate of eggplant parmesan
(That stuff is too hard to make
You stick with the nuts and berries)
You stick with your heavy butt
(I could use a Meatshake) I'll go back to Veggie Hut

(Alright)
Goodbye, you know what, I'm leaving. I can't even take this.
(I'll see you later)
This is very rude! (Alright)
It's about the meat (okay) really you should, oh, good grief
(Hey Brianna, I just killed a fly, was that murder? Hehehe, I never get sick of that one.)
(Hey are you working Thursday because I'd like to switch hours
Oh, Thursday, I'm...
(Oh, hey dude here comes Stover! Here comes Stover!)

Gentleman, talk is not work
Einstein, (Yes?) did you fill the pork grinder? (No, I forgot)
Einstein, fill the pork grinder (Okay, right away sir, right on top of it)
Einstein's on pork, man (pork man)
I hate Stover and I hate this job. I need a vacation...

This is the captain speaking. This is the daily flight of the caravel ?
Along the cost of Brazil, our route is northeast-north, starting from Rio de Janeiro
