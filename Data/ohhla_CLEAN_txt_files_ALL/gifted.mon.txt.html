[The-Weeknd]
Hmm-mmmm, ohh-ohhh, oh yeah..

All these bitches hate you..
This is something I know..
Because you're real enough to give it up..
There ain't nothing wrong with groupie love..
You're the only one I notice
It's really hard for me to focus, yeah
Cause my body so numb, all I do is kill pain
All I do is smoke loud, put you niggas to shame
I be rollin' all day, mix it in the champagne
And these bottles all free, not a single drink paid
Because they want me, they want me in their club
But if you got the numbers I'll be glad to show you love
Cause baby, I'm an XO nigga comin' up
Every time they play my song, I'mma fill another cup
Cause I'm down for whatever, I can always keep it up
All I need is some liquor just to keep a nigga up

[Chorus: The-Weeknd]
I'm gifted when I'm faded, I'm faded all the time
Because I know that's when they love me, they love me when I'm high
When they love me - I get money, I get money, I get money
When they love me - I get money, I get money, I get money
Said I'm gifted when I'm faded, I'm faded all the time
Because I know that's when they love me, they love me when I'm high
When they love me - I get money, I get money, I get money
When they love me - I get money, I get money, I get money, ohh

[French Montana]
I be gifted when I'm faded (hah), faded all the time
Thought they loved me when I made it (hah), niggas hated all the time
It's a dirty game; try to find a bitch, maybe get married (hah)
That's like pissin' in a freezer, trying to make canaries (WHOO)
Hawk vision, LA heels right on Huff Terrace
Making wishes, now I'm french kissin' your bitch in Paris (Paree)
Come and find me di Giannis that's from '92 (who)
Heard your small ass when I bought her a number two
Dippin' and you know it, I be pimpin' like I owe it
Come and find me now, I got an army with me now
Turn your brains oodles and noodles for thinkin' you got a screw loose
I tighten you up, them coroners will button you up - MONTANA!

[Chorus]

[French Montana]
Ay.. Tony Montana on his last batch (last batch)
This that Wayne Gretzky on his last scratch (last scratch)
This that Derek Jeter on his last catch (last catch)
This that Whitney Houston on her last track (last track)
This that Tiger Woods on his last swing (last swing)
This that Jimi Hendrix on his last string (last string)
This that Larry Davis on his last bang (last bang)
You can call me Hugh Hefner on his last fling (hah)
