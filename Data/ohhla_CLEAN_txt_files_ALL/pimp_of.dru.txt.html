   Mack playas, ballas, grindas.
   Yeah I'm the real true pimp of the year.
   Will ya feel me.
   Ha ha, pimp of the mutha' fuckin' year.
   
   Give it up give it up a give it to me. A big mack capalized double D.
   see. And it's on, so I'm a get sick wit it, a give me drank da bomb
   and let me get wit it. Yeeyah, cause I'm gonna be the biggest pimp of
   the year goin' around doin' shit like this here. Cause a nigga is
   strong, and way to long when it comes to my ding dong. But, bet, I get
   a check when I sign on the dotted line, cause a now I know I gotta get
   mine. It's really no thang to me, see, to be a real true P.I.M.P.
   Cause I had me a hoe or two or mo' way back in eighty fuckin' fo'.
   That's when I was a teen. But my dick was still big to make a bitch
   bleed, see. And of coarse I'm slappin' hoes, smackin' hoes, up and
   down tha fuckin' avenues. And ever I do that, I dig a deep in the
   pocket for tha fat gat. Feel me. I'm so god damn bad, that I had to
   kick off in a hoe's ass, cause the girl tried to do me, ride with her
   man in the mustang pony. And I know it'd catch up with her. Next day
   in the paper, yeah the nigga raped her. But I'm not trippin'. Bitches
   like you wanna keep on slippin'. So I had to move on, to the next
   young bitch that had it goin' on. Uh, and I'm not here to pump no
   fear, I'm just the mack playa' pimp of the year, bitch.
   
   Pimp, pimp on...
   You got all the ladies.
   Pimp, pimp on...
   You got all the ladies.
   
   First thang first on the second verse. I learned a hell of a lot, ah
   from the get down start. So I had my hoes hoin'. Had every tramp
   thinkin' I was the (?) goin'. Cause all the game I spit is good shit,
   and the shit that I spit made me rich. Cause I was all about money. If
   the girl says she down, well bees come and get the honey. Cause I'm
   givin' it up quick. Take a hit, take a lick at them pink lips. Uh, and
   a bet is better than grey, not knowin' that I bought this broad out of
   state. And I met her in (?). Lookin' just like the actress singer
   Whitney. But I knew she was a fake one, but to me young bro' it didn't
   really make me none. I just walked up to her. I said my name's Dru
   Down and I'll Slick Rick the ruler. And from the get go, I'm just a
   pimp, hoe, ya comin' with me, a to the east side O. And then she said
   okay, I'm on my way, let me pack my bags before today. Yeeyah, then I
   said get with it and don't be a bitch and try to split. Uh. She was
   right up under my wing ,at the airport at five fifteen. She said "Who
   are you and why are ya here?", I said I'm Dru Down and pimp of the
   year.
   
   Pimp, pimp on...
   You got all the ladies.
   Pimp, pimp on...
   You got all the ladies.
   
   I've got a thang for makin' hoes. Every woman than I touch bitch turns
   into gold. And I don't go for talk back, have respect when ya speakin'
   to a pimp fuck that. Deduct up from tha pay check, matta fact get yo
   ass in the back of the Cadillac, so I can ride and check mate. Like
   rule number eight I keep a bitch in a plate. And no I don't play
   around, fuck around, a when it comes to my money nigga. And when it
   comes to gettin' a bitch sprung, I give her Henesee, a with tha one on
   one. So she can get so high, real high, and that she that knows I'm
   that type a guy. Cause I'm a kick somethin' just for the hoes, and for
   myself I keep indo. And when a hoe finds out I'm real, yes I am, mack
   playa pimp of tha year.
   
   Pimp, pimp on...
   You got all the ladies.
   Pimp, pimp on...
   You got all the ladies.
   
   Pimp, pimp on...
   You got all the ladies.
   Pimp, pimp on...
   You got all the ladies.
