I be the raw cat, told 'em to fall back
This Vinnie wanna test like Horshack
8 blocks I'm all that - you think not?
It's indisputable that my musical output is quite suitable
Tryin to uplift the culture
So Ran freak beats like this opressive {?}
We make it buh-a-buh-bubble man, we trouble man
Snap on cats like rubberbands, no other can
Compose similies mentally
But the elitist bastards'll come up with 'em so I keep a pen on me
I paid the pentalty that come with bein Mega Ran
Dr. Wily tried but he never can (nah)
I wrote a verse for you and all of y'all who doubt me
Run it back like "Oh snap~! He talkin 'bout me"
I build it up 'til the amps is leakin
Leave 'em shook like Kramer at a Panther meeting
Whoahhh, now that's a little inappropriate
Took it so real, wasn't even supposed to get
I still hustle, I do it with real muscle
Wanna be LeBron? Well me I'm Bill Russell
I'ma tell you like I told it to the last man
Your raps is garbage put 'em in a trash can
Throwback, I'm a blast from the past man
You ain't a gangster - NAH! You a Flashman

CLICK! Your ass is takin pictures man
You a tourist!
I like watchin TV, but that don't make me an actor
Get it right

The big fish in the kiddie pool, spittin jewels
Gettin rid of fools when the situation get critical
Rappers get ridicules, step up your syllables
You a little dude, one step below miniscule
I pity fools, ain't no T in my name, we'll be in the game
Forget about it, bein the same (yeah!)
You ain't a boss, I'ma show you how a boss do
I feestyle leave out the R cause it cost you
I lost you? I spin it back like barstool
I feestyle, leave out the R, cause it cost you
Don't be fooled, you was not no star
Got no car, signallin, you got no bars
I was made in the lab, with nuts and bolts
I started crushin folks, sent the lab up in smoke
I'm harder than an alchemist studyin calculus
A life up in Auschwitz, ain't no way out of it
And I'm as Frank as Anne, I might shake your hand
But if I don't know you, you ain't my man
G told you to stay up in the stand with the fans
You better off makin up a dance, clap yo' hands!
I'ma tell you like I told it to the last man
Your raps is garbage put 'em in a trash can
Throwback, I'm a blast from the past man
You ain't a gangster - NAH! You a Flashman

Ha, CLICK! The moral of the story is
Stay in your lane man, be a fan
It's way too many rappers, and not enough fans
So fall back, get yourself in order, then come out
Knahmsayin? Everybody that likes rap, cannot rap
So think about it, huh, cause you a Flashman
It's Big Random Beats!
I'm out</pre>
