[Ke$ha]
Last night I had enough of you, I put on the brakes
And I could tell you took it hard, it was all over your face
That you were slippin, and flippin, but here is the sitch
I signed up for a man, but you are just, a, bitch
You should know oh-oh-oh-oh
That I love-ah-ah-ah-ah
you a lo-ah-ah-ah-ah-ot
but I just can't date a dude with a vag'

[Chorus]
When we fell in love, you made my heart drop
Then you had me thinkin 'bout you non-stop
But you cry 'bout this and whine about that
When you grow a pair/pear, you can call me back
Yeah I think you're hot, I think you're alright
But you're actin like a chick all the time
You were cool and now you're not; just like that
When you grow a pair/pear, you can call me back

[Ke$ha]
When I first met you - panties droppin!
Everytime I saw you - it was on and
one day you asked if we could just talk
and that's the reason why I'm walkin
If I am honest, I'm just not hooked on your phonics
I'm not tryin to be rude or crude
I just wanted one thing from you and you got confused
You should know oh-oh-oh-oh
That I love-ah-ah-ah-ah
you a lo-ah-ah-ah-ah-ot
but I just can't date a dude with a vag'

[Chorus]

[Ke$ha]
When you grow a pair/pear, you can call me back {*2X*}
Grow a pair/pear, you can call me back
When you grow a pair/pear, you can call me back ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ohhhhhh! Grow a pair/pear, you can call me back
And no, I don't want to see your mangina
When you grow a pair/pear, you can call me back

[Chorus]</pre>
