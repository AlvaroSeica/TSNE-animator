[Intro: Cno Evil (Li-Mouse)]
Ahh, finally inside, man (It's kinda nice in here, dog)
They got a coat check? (Fuck that, I ain't leaving my shit over there)
True true true (yo yo yo yo, are those them same two girls, from over --
outside?)
(Yo, dog, we gonna play the split-up game, dog, you go that way, I'mma go
this way, we gon' see what happens)
I got that (Yoyo, you go that way, Dawaun.. fucking.. bitch ass nigga) Why
is talking like that?
(Yeah really, anyway, you go that way, I'mma go this way.. we gonna see what
happens) I'm feeling this beat alot
(It's kinda hot, yo straight up..)

[Cno Evil]
As I stood there, without a single care
I stay prepared with a cold stare
Told the pretty lady, to creep up over here
Don't be scared, I sware, I'll treat you real fair
Just pull up a chair and sit next to me
Shine like a glare full of ecstasy
Let your hips express, dance, in Copacabana
All dressed up to impress, full of finesse and glamour
Drop it like a hammer, hard and pound it to the ground
As the bass trembles through your body sounds going up and down
Your spine, I grab you from behind, make you feel fine
Told the DJ to rewind, keep going on that grind
You want a drink, baby girl, what you want?
Just tell me what it is, stop acting nonchalant
My expertise sees you want Malibu Bay Breeze
Cranberry pineapple, so much ice you might freeze
I know how to please, stop acting like a tease
Have you on top of me, twirling three hundred and sixty degrees
Like a ballerina, man you should of seen her
She had a perfect ass like Keyra Augustina
Mira, mira, the chick was a Latina
Was raised in New York, but was born in Argentina
I think her name was Gina, or maybe was Selina
Sharp sense of humor, kept on laughing like a hyena
Oh God, and what a tight bod
With that dress on, made her seem like a facade
Tight shirt, bling from the ring on her tummy
Chewing on a bubblegum, tongue taste real yummy
Sweet kiss, strawberry gloss on her lips
My mind's full of bliss as I reminisce on her tits
I can't resist, I had to bring it there
Once I'm with her, I don't wanna go nowhere
And she's not a gold digger and you know that's rare
With her, I don't gotta be a millionaire
I declare her as my wifey, I don't need affairs
Cuz there is no other, that can even compare

[Li-Mouse]
Aiyo Cno's over there, Li-Mouse over here
I'm up on this bitch, niggas spill shit on my gear
My wallabees are getting, all splashed up
These cats think I'm strolling through the crowd, all smashed up
Got a cup of Goose and juice, I stay loose
So if I approach you, I don't need no lame excuse
Smoke machines fogging up my sight
I see this chick eyeballing me, through the flashing light
Moving her body in ways I can't comprehend
Must of been a miracle the way she can make it bend
As I step closer, I was taken by surprise
She was moving her ass up on all these other guys
So I dunked the fitted, took a sip of the beverage
Grabbed some other chick only to gather some leverage
Her eyes ain't leave my sight as we just stared away
She smirked at me definitely that she cared
Stubborn to walk up first
Ain't me that was about to show I had the thirst
So I seen her dead homeboy with the throat cut
Came over with authority raised her hands like what
Threw chick from in front of me, I was stuck
So she threw her fine shaped butt hard right in my gut
Smell her aroma I see how her bath and body works
She move vicious ain't care if that shit hurts
I see Cno got his hands full to the brim
But this chick moves like she dislocated her limb
I grabbed her waist with haste, fuck a slap in the face
I'm losing out on all my space
Li Dash Mouse got the bump that you can dance to
Ain't nothing you fruits can jump and prance to
Rodentz be mad versatile with the style
Flow the opposite direction like Egypt and the Nile</pre>
