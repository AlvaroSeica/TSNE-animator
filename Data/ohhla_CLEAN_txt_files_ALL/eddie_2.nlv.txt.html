[Yella]

I told y'all
Come and lay the arms for Eddie Bow part two
They still sweatin' so hard, and it's a shame they need more
Cuz way back in the days they just needed three or four
But now it's 95 and I don't need to show you how
I know you know the old dance that I call the Eddie Bow

[Chorus-Tec-9]
Bitch we never gone walk, bitch we always gone Bow
We never gone walk, we always gone Bow
Won't ya, bow, bow, bow, bow, bow, bow, bow, bow
Won't ya, bow, bow, bow, bow, bow, bow, bow, bow
Cuz nigga you ain't tough, nigga you ain't tough,
Bitch you ain't bad so fuck you and MIIIIIIIIICHAEL

[1st Verse-Tec-9]

Upstairs in a room we start the barhop stop
Turned around and seen Ya, hoes was on my jock
Now it's birdies in the house, gotta guard the bitch up
Bout to get your World crowded by them soldiers in the chucks
You some real ass niggas, some down ass niggas
Say them 3rd Ward niggas, say them 3rd Ward niggas
Now like a dog hit, get nasty like a freak
Like my ex-17th Ward bitch Rontinique
She used to lick my whole body
And she even used to tickle
On the real she like her man and she could suck a mean dick
Now won't you bow for the 3rd Ward
I say now bow for the 10th Ward
Now won't you bow for the 13th

[Chorus]

[2nd Verse-Yella]

I was doin' about 60 on my style I had a white lady
I looked over at Tec because he really wants to leave the scene
It wasn't fuckin' long before that bitch was cuttin' corners
He got that bitch out there I thought I was a goner
Racin' up the block, couldn't wait on them hoes
And I kept my shield up, steady showin' my golds
First stop was Saint Thomas where I saw this hoe
I peeped the nigga hit a hoe, I hit the one that's on my right
Nigga bow for a nigga that keep things locked
Can't forget that hoe poppin' off 2nd &amp; Drop
Now won't you bow for the Melphanine?
Won't you bow for the Josephine?
Now won't you bow for the Calliope?
I said you bow for the Calliope.
Now won't bow for the Magnolia?
I said now bow for the Magnolia

[Chorus]

[3rd Verse-Tec-9]

It's the 3rd verse and we almost there,
I guess it's time to talk about the hoes with real short hair
Stop two guess who?  I see the 17th crew
All I know is they hella inject, a.k.a. the baldin' group
I got my nigga Lil Ya, fuckin' them hoes with a glock
All three of us together makin' them hoes pussy pop
If you down with the 3, then you know just what to do
Won't you break em off proper with that Bow part two?
Now won't you bow for that 3rd Ward?
I say now bow for that 10th Ward
Now won't you bow for the 13th?
Now won't you bow for the 17th?
Now won't you bow for the Melphanine?
I said now bow for the Josephine
Now won't you bow for the Calliope?
I said now bow for the Calliope
Now won't you bow for the Magnolia?
Now won't you bow for the Magnolia?

[Chorus]  (2X)</pre>
