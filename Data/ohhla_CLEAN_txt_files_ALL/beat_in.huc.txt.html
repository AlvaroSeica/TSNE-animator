Typed by: AZ Lyrics

15s in the trunk
4/12s in the trunk
4/10s in the trunk
Since my 9s in the dash
License plate rattling
Bumper kit draging
Trunk straight blasting
Yeah

I got that, I got that, I got that, I got that
I got that, I got that, I got that, I got that
And it sounds like
I got that, I got that, I got that, I got that
I got that, I got that, yeah
And it sounds like this
I got that beat up in my trunk
I got that beat up in my trunk
I got that beat up in my trunk
Yeah
Yeah
I got that beat up in my trunk
I got that beat up in my trunk
I got that beat up in my trunk
Yeah
Yeah
I got that beat up in my trunk
I got that beat up in my trunk
I got that beat up in my trunk
Yeah
Yeah
License plate rattling
Bumper kit draging
Trunk straight blasting
Yeah
Boom boom
Blam blam
That's what you hear when I'm coming
So 15s in the trunk
Got the license plate humming</pre>
