[Wilson]
I'm in love with a girl that's hot pink
Everytime I stare I do not blink
She's a star, something like an actress
She looking good with red and the black dress
Ignored all the she say he say
We been close since the Sega CD days
That means we been dating for a while
My heart melts every time she smiles
We pose so we can look nice for the camera
We pose so we can look nice for the camera
We stay out son...
and I ain't talkin bout guns when I say that shes nice with the hammer
We had some good times, we had some bad times
But our love will never have a flatline
my best friend she far from a foe
Her first name's Amy, last name Rose

[Chorus]
Love is patient and love is kind
and love does not boast or fall for pride
but I show you off and I take you places
Jealous ones envy, I see their faces

[Ran]
Have you ever met a girl that you wanted to date
but yet all of your homies showed nothing but hate
let me tell a story of my situation
I was dating this girl and I got impatient
I spoke about her, in the old days
now there's no way, I can grow without her
see we dated for a while, thought I knew her good
now she got me feeling things never knew I could
but her dad and I don't see eye to eye
now I'm missing her like geeks miss Firefly
or like, new muslims miss swine
I'd do anything to try to make Miss mine
she my heroine, nah, she my crack
I clean up my act, dang near spit shine
I don't think love is something that you can fall in
because I love hard, baby I'm all in
I'm so excited baby I can't hide it
first name Kalinka, last name Cossack

[Chorus]</pre>
