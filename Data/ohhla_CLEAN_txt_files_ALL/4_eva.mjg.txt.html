(MJG)
I can make you get buck 
Even if you don't go to the club that much
I got so much rhythm I can feel it
MJG and Eightball we the realest
Baby you can bill it to the P.O. box
When you feelin real good
Luxury soft leather with the real wood
Type of attitude whenever I come around
After-party baby welcome down to U-Town

(Eightball)
I roll with them fools who love to blow trees
I represent Eightball and MJG
You wanna get down you wanna flow like us
G's from overseas blow drow like us
I love them women who got they head on straight
I love them women who like to lay it on eight
Jump in with me we can dip flip
Start a relationship with your lips and your hips

(Chorus)
DJ's playin the music make the dance floor want to move it 
Move your body at the party at the party at the party

(MJG)
Are you feelin like I'm feelin cause I'm feelin good naw wait great
Feelin like I could move a whole damn state, huh-uh, a planet
And it's time for the beat to do damage 
Ain't nobody gonna tell us how to do it
We gon' do it how we wanna do it
We gon' bring it how we wanna bring it
And if you can't understand how we flow
Its provision decision revision then go
And I can't understand how I'm on 
And I'm still going strong with the green sticky gone out my system
It keeps me up when hard times beat me up

Im lookin good as I look into my rear view
Now hear me like you want me to hear you
Put your worries and your debts all behind you
And let the rythm of the Alpine find you

(Chorus)

(Eightball)
We gon' bounce bounce till we can't no more
Puff puff till it ain't no more
Drink Drink till we throw up on the floor
Shine so bright we make the whole world glow
Got soul fo' sho' we deep from the South
Haters they try but they ain't keeping us out
We peepin the doubt but thats alright 
My mic skills be tight ain't just aight
This for all my dogs who got love in they heart
Be an individual and show it in your art
For all of those who disagree we ain't trippin
We ride the slab wit' that space age pimpin
Ball and G and thats all we be and thats all we see and thats all we need
No fakes or snakes that wanna rape a tape 
Just us and the beats for the DJ to play

(Chorus till end)</pre>
