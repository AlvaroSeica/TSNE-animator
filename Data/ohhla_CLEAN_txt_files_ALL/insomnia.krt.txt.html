[Chorus]
It's late, but I'm out on the creep
Been a while since I heard you speak
Hard to rest when I've been on this road
All I want is you next to me
cause you help me sleep, you help me sleep
You help me sleep, you help me sleep shawty
Yeah, I swear it bout four in the morning
and I'm out chere on it
Tryna fall through just to fuck with you
Well, that's if you're home
cause you help me sleep, you help me sleep
You help me sleep, you help me sleep shawty

[Big K.R.I.T.]
Getting harder and harder to relax, can't rest my back
I gotta be on my Ps and my Qs when I roll with this tool in this old school 'Lac
cause niggas try to jack nowadays in the hood, those broke niggas up to no good
Keep a cup full of drank and I'm filling my tank, plus I rolled up some of that umph
Stick-icky, sour, Jolly Rancher candy
Make the bottom of my cup sweet as your punani, well I'm just joking shawty
I talk about pussy a lot and getting money when I get unfocussed shawty
cause I'm dealing with the pain of the game and it's getting harder to keep coping shawty
Cause I can't save the world and I showed that, so I hold back
from doing what I can to be a better man, forgetting you know that
So we fuss and fight when I'm gone, wasn't right with my wrongs
Almost there, won't be long, don't fall asleep on the phone

[Chorus]

[Big K.R.I.T.]
Tell me what you got on, send a pic to my phone
I've been out all day tryna make a way for you, hell yeah I'm in the zone
just to eat you out, tell me what that peach about
Feeling good, feeling great when I pull off your lace and ease it in and ease it out
and ease it in again, I got to get home
Yeah I been drinking, don't be acting like it don't feel the same, I hear it in your tone
Yeah I was wrong for earlier, but baby girl I'm on the way
So keep playing with yourself cause I'm making that left, I'm at the gate
Buzz me in, meet me at the door
Body soaking wet, panties on the floor
Yeah I got that, rock that, beat it till it's sore when I knock that, chop that up
When you suck, better sop that up, don't run when it's deep, better prop that up

[Chorus]

*sex interlude*
