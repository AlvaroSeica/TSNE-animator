Bury the past in a letter
Whiskey on the dresser
thoughts never stray
far from the first day you met her
Your better half passive possessor
Drink until your happy that you left her
forget her
Let it fester in your mind all the times she cried
Eyes wide behind her disguise, pride denied
By your spineless, kindless, mindless
Timeless flaw the finest
lost as to what your crime is
Fine, you'll give her things to remember
Pull a string and enter as she sings a surrender
Pretender with tender messages and whatever
suspends disbelief and the grief you present her
Sensor the senses, the people, the places
The faces, the tastes
the wasted makeshift rings and bracelets
Pacing, needing a facelift, in the basement faking
Waiting for the chase to end
It blends fine when you're blind to the spikes of time
Give her a sign that you care and write the rhymes
Some words to let her know
you're keeping your feelings confined
Against revealing the design, stealing your mind
Tormenting innocence
never listening, tears glistening
loving simpleton
Hand in hand with romance
in a dance to oblivion, oblivious
Wrapped in the riddle of the fickle and the hideous

(I feel the fate)
On her face, in her fears
cause nobody cares in the end and that's life
In her eyes as the tears multiply
and you embrace till everything is right
In the way that you move
from doom to the top of the dizzyest heights
In the mood that consumes
all that you thought you knew was true
but not quite

Home on your throne
You told her that you had grown
Read poems over the phone
Believed it within your bones
What a joke
Should have known
You've shown you're still a stone
Apathetic, pathetic, a living drone
Dial tone, destined to die alone
Right or wrong, words never register
Take the best of her
Chew it up, spit it out
Soon as you're ahead of her
An obsessed competitor
It's not her it's you ex-cetera ex-cetera
She takes a step closer
you take a step away
Left to play with decay taking your breath away
The disarray no more distant than yesterday
All that's left is shattered expectations to investigate
Let me demonstrate how you create the pain
Place the blame on the rest and take aim
Too ashamed to maintain so you complain
Fan the flames, call it a game and never change
You see romance as depressing, never a blessing
They take from you
until your left with nothing but investments
Repressing feelings with no hope for direction
No scope for reflection, no rope in case of rejection
On close inspection she bleeds when you dream
Feeds on your self esteem machine
In between the scenes
she fiends for someone to treat her like a queen
But you treat her like a bitch
till she screams exactly what it seems

(I feel the fate)
On her face, in her fears
cause nobody cares in the end and that's life
In her eyes as the tears multiply
and you embrace till everything is right
In the way that you move
from doom to the top of the dizzyest heights
In the mood that consumes
all that you thought you knew was true
but not quite</pre>
