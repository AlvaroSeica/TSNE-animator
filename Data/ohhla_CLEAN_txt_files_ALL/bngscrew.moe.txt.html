[Big Moe]
Well ain't no plex with the East and the West
and plenty drink for your kids and plenty of weed for your chest
So leave your pistol at home cause we ain't tryin to go to war 
The common denominator in the sitution is calm like a star 
you can shine with me 
roll on 20's and smoke pine with me
C'mon they tryin to leave your mine with me
stady be sellin,celebratin, for payin our dues
so much drank in my cup cause the water won't even move
as a playa - and associate with the plexin 
Bone hard click, Monroe City, Texas
a veteran don't get me wrong cause I'll put you a glass
steady pour you a glass instead of beatin on your ass!!
take a chill pill pill 
blow some kill, pop the steal
since we won't be seen
sippin syrup from police
From the thirty-third coast it ain't no rush lil g
So split your 4 to the Remi and have a toast degree
  
(Chorus: repeat 2X)
All I wanna do, is bang screw
in the dirty-third, the city of syrup, bangin screw)
  
[Big Moe]
Big Moe Done stepped in (2X)

Big moe ride down the 4
Y2K with my headlights on
crossin threw the yellowstone 
bout to scoop me a yellowbone
po sex to my stop one
time for me to play my song
and they better leave moe alone 
in others words just sing the song

Chorus
  
[Big Moe]
in the city of syrup we like to jam music slow
still come up with substance to make them hit the floor
84's and vogues with the freshest on my lows
specialy on the 4 doors
bump the strapes against the rows
flosh low, concert, looking like a lumber yard
waving my trunk up and down the boulevard
Charge the platinum card and the Visa to the max!!!
Still won't get no sleep till my click see some cacs
Cadillacs and six packs we guys bangin screw
Click click clack clack, get your wimp ass threw
Payin dues and styin true is the rule of the game
On top of the food chains
Bangin screw and it won't change for nothin
  
Chorus 4X</pre>
