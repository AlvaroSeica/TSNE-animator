[Chamillionaire]
Left wing of my crib there's a marble room
Right wing there's a room just for all my spoons
I sing on this track that's what they assume
Sorry but my engineer ran out of auto-tune
You rap but I feel that you are a coon
And the other one's that ain't coon are buffoons
Try me, and you will fail in the arms of doom
Cause that vuh, vuh-Venom album coming soon
Fifty thousand dollar fresh in my living room
Try to steal it and I bet you won't live to noon
Put the camera on ya chick like I'm Benny Boom
And then I hit her quick, vroom, vroom
Your girl say she love me cause I'm cool and laid back
Said she wanna do WHAT~!? I said "Cool" and laid back
Perpetrator vision, I see through they facts
All these rappers sweeter than some Kool-Aid packs
My Lincoln longer than two Maybachs
My front yard longer than two race tracks
Hearin them but'chu know they goin use they gats
I don't be hangin with none of them dudes, they whack (they whack)
She was speakin in a whisper like Sade
Will I call her, never yes, told her probab-ly (okay)
Paparazzi, you better do what I say
To me a face like a camera to Kanye
If you late on my team you know you docked
If I'm late you gon' wait 'til I move out
Got'cha chick bout to take off her tubetop
I purchase rims like your Footlock or shoe shop
Tell her friend that I rather have a enemy
Money tall and your money just a Mini-Me
The class gotta S like Hennessy
And I gotta SS like Tennessee
I stay super fly like a kite so
You should know that you can't see me like a white crow
Walk in all the women get in flight mode
She 'bout to take off all her nice clothes
Ha ha! </pre>
