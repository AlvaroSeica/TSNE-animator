[Meek Mill]
Yea Yea
Let Me Grab My Shoulder Right
Shiny Patten Leather Pradas Look Like A Bowlin Ball
Diamonds On My Neck And Wrist Haters Like He Showin Off
Cause I Be Shittin On Dese Niggas All Around And Overall
Back Up On MY Ol' Shit Watch Me Make A Joke Of Ya'll
I Scoop Ya Bitch Up And Her Friend And Like I Jus Won From Both Of Ya'll
Skeeno Fresh Up Out Da Boat, How You Wanna Soap For Song
Cause I Jus Wanna Give It To You Fast, Hold On Let Me Fone A Call
Meek Milly, What Da Dealy How You Feelin?
I Say I Feel Like A Million When I Step Up In The Buildin
My Neck Tell You Dat I'm Chilin, My Wrist Say Dat I'm Ok
I Be Stuntin When I Cum In, I Don't Pay No I Don't Wait
Say We Bottle Pop, Hurricane and Chris Like Ay-Bay-Bay
Let Them Models Rock, We Fuck With Dat WHITE Like KKK
Steal Yo Bitch Rite In Yo Face, And Den Like Mike I Fade Away
So Tell Dem LAMES Stay Out My Way Before I Fuck Up Dey Whole Day
Mindin My Business, Cause My Mind Is My Business
I Make Way Mor For Rappin Den You Makin Off A Trappin
First I Cum On Dem Who Rattin, Den I Stop With 30 Stacks
Den All Dis Funny Shit I'm Hearin Got Me Dyin From The Laughter

[Oschino]
Dey Hate To See Me Eatin Rite
Cause Dey Fuckin Pockets Low
White Benz, Black Rims
Shit Look Like A Domino
Ridin Slow, Bucket Low,
Yea You See Me Blinging Hard
Cleaner Den A Bolier Hoe, Diamonds Like A Deck Of Cards
Fresh As Shit Like Wrecking Balls
When We Step Up In The Place, Lotta Money
Lotta Lace, Lotta Chicken Lotta Cake
Ballin At The Bar, We At The Bar Fillin Sides Of Drinks
No We Ain't Got No Job, Ye But We Got Dat Weight
What You Think?, What We Do?
Birds Not Dat Birds To Sue, Murder Who?
Murder You, That Mack You Shelf Like A Turtle Do
Niggas Mad Cause I'm Eatin, Niggas Mad Cause I'm Eatin
What Dey Make In One Year, A Nigga Make In One Weekend
Fuckin With Dem Puerto Ricans, JULIO, Javier
Give Me Mean Fish, Mean Fish Shit Porrinahs FEAR
Why You Think My Diamonds Clear?
Gettin Money My Career
Nigga Pop FLy, Put Dat Nigga Liek A Thousand Year</pre>
