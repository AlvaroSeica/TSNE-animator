How can I be torn from the pages of history? huh?
How can my name scraped off the pyramid walls
when I sat with Pharoahs and Kings?
You think you know, but you have no idea

This track's here it's like a breath of fresh air
That shaved thru sunrays families suffer on Sundays
Had to run astray, pack up and run away
Fountain of youth, found it, feel like da younger A
Make sure my son okay, shit, that's the da mission
College tuition, hope he get accepted to Princeton
If not got his bail for prison
I know the pressures of the oppressor It's hell living
Feel like I'm Mel Gibson, killing 'em kindly finally
Niggas untied me mami, love the punani, but I
Can't make you my Boni never, made for the cold weather
Hatas y'all know better, how can I fold? I was told to hold it together
Listen, no intermissions, I am, so in position, like, Ali and Liston
Who could? box me to distance, try me
Now the police call to give orders to creep on ya
I master the street corners relax in the feet sauna and
Fuck if y'all don't like I'm here and I'm shown niceness
Appear in my own likeness, I zone as my own phychic

Flow if a niggas holding my clothing'll get you open
I'm toasting in bitches posting approaching wit mixed emotions
And ready like military I'm varied like Ben and Jerry's
Comparing me to him is scary I'm leery as cemeteries
And losing is not inside me stay moving from paparazzi
I'm proving the angels got me, I'm cool but my game is cocky
And money can never make me, my guns they don't come wit safeties
I hung wit the ones that's crazy I come from the front of Macy's
Shopping and dropping eighties show stopping wit proper ladies
I'm hearing a lot of maybe's but nigga it's hot as AZ

Ha ha ha
Eyo it's a wrap baby, we got 'em right now, going platinum man, 202k
Brooklyn Stand up!
