[Verse One: Phonte]
Lay down baby
Please don't say a word
Dry your tears, I guess by now you've heard
That I'm leaving again
One more day and I'll be in the sky
So far away from the life of you and I
The place I can pretend
To forget about the times that you said 

That if you never take the time to
Breathe in and look inside you
If you're lost I'll try to find you and remind you of the way
That you'll feel when this all ends someday 

[Chorus]
And maybe now you'll understand
That God is laughing at your plans
What will be will be
Why don't you come inside my friend
Out of the rain and maybe then
You'll see what I see 

[Chantae Cann]
He plays until the sun goes down
And falls asleep to the sound of a song
That he says reminds him of you
And when he smiles 
They say that he looks just like you
Just walkin around like the world is his stage
Cause that's all a young man can do
When his hero's not around 

Cause if you never take the time to
Breathe in and look inside you
If you're lost I'll try to find you and remind you of the way
That you'll feel when this all ends someday

[Chorus]</pre>
