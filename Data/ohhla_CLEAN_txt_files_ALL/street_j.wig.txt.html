[Shawn Wigs]
Yo, street justice, I run through the streets, you can't touch this
Say two words, and I might bring back the ruckus
You bitch, watch me switch styles like the shady eight
All over your grill, cut cracks on your plate
Facts that I've been eating, these streets won't starve me, I'mma
King of New York, you'se a king like Steve Harvey
Faggots, I leave flies and shit maggots, and that
Hole in your head, you push through with lead
You'se a fool, label like a rap special ed
This is Theodore, real street justice you can cheer for
Solomon Childs, got murder verses to fear for
Ghost got fire like Kryme and Trife Dies'
And big Cappadonna spit darts with ease
And our guns stay tucked by our backbones and bellies
Fully loaded, my desert eag spit loose shellies</pre>
