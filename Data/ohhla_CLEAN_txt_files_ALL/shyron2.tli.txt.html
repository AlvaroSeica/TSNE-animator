Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Rihanna]
You know the system
we have the fire power
and we have each other
You ready?

[Ronnie groans]

[Rihanna]
Yeah, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
We at it again, everybody now
Hands in the air, it's a stick up, stick up
no funny business or you get lit up, lit up
You test I (I), you gon' die (die)
And at your funeral ya mama gon' cry
So customers kiss the floor, floor
And clerks open cash drawers slow, slow
If you don't wanna end up dead
You'll do everything Shy Ronnie says
Tell 'em, Ronnie!

[Ronnie murmurs]
Hey its shy Ronnie
Now you down on the floor
I'm getting changed in my bag in the back of the store
but I'm gonna go and be the best
I knew it and suck my dick in the butt in the forest
but it doesn't matter
because we coming for your money ha-haa!

[Rihanna]
No one in the bank can hear you
Shy Ronnie, use your outside voice
We don't have time for this
Let's go

So stay on the ground it's a stick up, stick up
Your wallets and jewels we'll pick up, pick up
Unload the cash (cash), move your ass (ass)
We gettin' money, tell 'em Shy Ronnie

[Ronnie murmurs]
Now I'm on the scene
shy Ronnie with the heat
but uh oh I'm gonna get touched
but now I'm gonna tell you why it don't stop
and its gonna be a long night
sucking on your gets boner ha-HAAA

[Rihanna]
Please, please use your words
Just imagine that everyone's naked
Uh, oh!
Boner alert. He really pictured them naked

[Ronnie]
HA-HAA!

[Rihanna]
Why did I think you could do this?
Ronnie hostage on the move [gunshot]
He shot himself
Why is your gun so small?
The police are on their way

[Police]
(Come out with your hands up)

[Rihanna]
Good luck, Shy Ronnie
Bye, bye!

[Ronnie]
HA-HAA!

Ronnie motherfucker and I'm back from the dead
Brain bored with the murder, so I shot my own leg
Don't get the name twisted, cause I'm crazy as shit
I hung a giant ass noose off my giant ass dick

[Rihanna]
Aye! I forgot this money
And also this guy
Come on, we're gonna have sex
Too-da-loo!

[Ronnie]
And you can hang from it
Cause you don't wanna see my real gun
Shots to the sky but your face sound real fun!
Ronnie!</pre>
