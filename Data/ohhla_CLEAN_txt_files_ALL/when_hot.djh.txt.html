Intro:
Check it out now. Till 2000. Honda. No.I.D.
Dug Infinite smooth as an instrament.

NO I.D.:
Yo I go my own style yeah yeah now check my method
On my own pal yeah yeah I never left it
Hold my spot down every time I got down
Searching for the answers lost and not found
On how I stay crowned is to live like a king
See I can put you down yo it's really not a thing
Simple ain't it check out how I paint it
Every shade accurately laid 
For all the optics that's made to stop tricks
Bangin' on our head and they hit like drop kicks
NO Idenity you don't know me and never seen me
Stayin' in the Windy (why?)
Because it's always in me
Now Honda put it on the tables add plenty
Unique sound a-yo we do freak sounds
And do our own thing (own thing) eternally
A-yo you know how I do

Hook:
When you're hot you're hot when you're not you're not
I'm Dug Infinite I came to heat up the spot
Yo it's NO I.D. I'm about to go nonstop
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah uh
When you're hot you're hot when you're not you're not
It's NO I.D. the heavy weight is on your block
It's Dug Infinite I'm about to take you to the top

Dug Infinite:
No doubt it'll be the loss of govern proability
That makes it more then likely that we rock your whole facility
We tight shit rip mic shit
It's Infinite never ifin' it we need five times before we rhyme
It's never instant-ly this freestyle ain't free
It's calculated it's organized watch we relate it
To this lost foundation in this hip hop nation
Better tune in before they ruin our situation
For the cash it really don't mean that cash we the flash
Media that's enough MC's that lose they ass
It got me dustin' off my shell toes freezin' on my elbows
Catch a flash back picture me goin' ass back
It's never that scenerio
It reigns like stereo sound that jack of all tray be on my crown
I never ledge in other words I seen the edge
I got advantage over most cats who can't manage

Hook

Dug Infinite:
A-yo me and my man we had a plan to make a hundred million
Nobody robbin' or killin' or buyin' weight from Sicilans
We havin' building in every slum plus the ghetto
It's new construction on every field plus the meadow
Nobody stoppin' me cause proceed properly
Completely thorough, I got wide vision never narrow
Makin' mucho deniro like Robert Denero
Playin' Heat we rock a real tight crew that's hard to beat

NO I.D.:
So as the days go by raise your eye 
No sleepin' you deep in fantasies
No I.D. travelin' through time and space
I got no time to waste keepin' up the pace
For when the hope seems lost steady savin' papes
So when I gotta pay the cost
Elementary ciphers that's goin' every century
Lockin' up a life similar to penitentiary
Mention me, master MC, NO I.D.
