[Intro: (Clark Kent) Fat Joe]
(RIP ODB, street fabulous) Crack, ODB, still jiggin
Jiggin in the graves, Crack

[Fat Joe]
I say hold up, wait a minute
Trunk full of butter, pocket full of spinach
Ya'll muthafuckas just raps and gimmicks
These muthafuckas just raps and gimmicks
Everything I spit, I live it
Yep, GT Black, Sky Blue Vintage
Bout to drop the top so you can see me better
Painted full style graffitti leather
I've been doing this since Eazy's era
Arguing with Dapper Dan, he says PE's better
(Hold it now) like Chuck said
Joe got incredible flow, enough said
They say gangstas get fat and move to Miami
So I did just that, I moved to Miami
Me and OD go back to '92
I was there at the 36 Chambers of the Wu

[Chorus 2X: Ol' Dirty Bastard (Brooklyn) {Both}]
{Ooh nigga I'm burning up}
{I said Ooh nigga I'm burning up}
(Best best to leave if you fucking with us)
I told the DJ nigga {Turn it up}

[Curtains]
They say youngin get right, and youngin get fresh
Cus youngin got a mic, and youngin got wreck
Then youngin got a check, and youngin done splurged on em
Now I do the flying spur on em, I George Burns on em
I probably got your cousin, He fronting? Strange, what's his name?
Ain't nothing change excpet the number on the chain
Nine, seven, five, to fourteen k, nigga give me mine and be on your way
Get sprayed for that shit you on
One shot, point blank, you're gone
And shorty look fine, so she won't squirm
Riding out on FDR, bumping Ol' Dirty's shit
I like it raw, you heard me baby
But you look like you burning baby, old lady

[Chorus]

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Enough to make a nigga, go crazy
Shut down the Grammy's, ask my grammy
Wu-Tang for the kids, but your host can't stand me
Wu-Tang for the kids, bust them off for family
Catch me on Disney (ma, who is he?)
Down Dirty, stinky, grime and grizzly
Old man McGirt, lookin' under your skirt
Fucked the pussy til' it's orange, like Ernie and Bert
Like, ooh, nigga, I'm burnin' up
She said, ooh, nigga, I'm burnin' up
Meth got the weed, we can burn it up
I told the D.J., nigga, turn it up
I want a girl that help me take my medication
Or I don't end up at the police station
I don't wanna go back to the police station
They tried to send Dirt on a long vacation

[Chorus]

[Outro: Clark Kent]
ODB rest in peace, Fat Joe, Young Brooklyn, Curtains, Dope Boy C</pre>
