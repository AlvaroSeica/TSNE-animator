[Royal Flush]
Let's get the definition of a foul man, Flush the Royal here
Bustin niggas down, fuck the spoiled plan
Hittin up the snag team vans, army suit, guns and rams
Man, fuck it, if you live this life you got to love it
Whose the one you trusted, organize wit niggas stayin dusted
On the loaf key, if a nigga owe, we got to see me
Weekly, fuck a freebie, Land Rover, Jeeps and TV's
The land see what I see, extortion plus velocity
Murder niggas constantly, no doubt, end of discussion
Started to bustin, if you want beef, bring it to Flushing

[Phenom Pacino]
I sit and analyze the Earth as it twist on it's axis
Two four the cream without the taxes
The hand cock relaxes, I'm baggin grands up in plastics
My moves must be made everlastin, my past change to present
Prophecies, no market the beats
Push me, to be a revolutionary industry
I clone heat, holdin down 50 g tones a week
Nuff in the smash plans, a wise man don't speak
Cuz jealously, envy, for figga trigga niggas
Bust, evil bitches hold a key to a man's lust
I rush, try to touch what I don't got
If I'm incarcerated, Royal Flush'll blow ya block, muthafucka

[Royal Flush]
It's like a nuclear reaction, back down guns, niggas is blastin
Streets are cashin, late night, black assassin
Flush'll make it happen, first stickin, I started rappin
Whose the one to blame, when you elevatin the game
Stress before pleasure, niggas get bagged, so whatever
Slugs in leathers, will have ya life, under pressure
Royal handmade, blowin this world just like grenades
Sex to techs to uzi's, niggas can't do me
Since a young child, livin in corrupt, cuz I'm foul
That's my style, nigga did a bullet on the Isle
Meanwhile, my little brother's on the street, holdin heat
Bustin at whatever creeps all night, cuz shit's deep
New York don't sleep, diamond Rolex, cars and drinks
Niggas wit minks, five g stones, and Cuban links
Eyes chink, fuckin wit these niggas made a nigga think
Now I gotta get cheddar, let a nigga shine forever
