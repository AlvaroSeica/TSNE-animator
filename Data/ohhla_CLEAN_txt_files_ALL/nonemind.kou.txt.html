Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

Good times, come
Past the point I'm done
Walk with nothin in mind
When I feel the heat
Both sides to meet
Once passed through the end of time
Ohhhhhhhhhhhh-ohhhhhhhhhhhh
Ohhhhhhhhhhhh-ohhhhhhhhhhhh
I try to give, {?}
I guess I wouldn't {?}
Dust in the wind, travellin again
Who knows I could laugh to the beat
Ooooooooh, doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doh
Ohhhhhhhhhhhh-ohhhhhhhhhhhh
Ohhhhhhhhh-ohh-ohhhhhhhhhhh

Walk with nothin in mind</pre>
