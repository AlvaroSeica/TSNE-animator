[Trae]
On the cool a nigga fed up, if I could recall
Back deep in the day, a nigga doubted us
Now everybody wanna claim, they down with us
Cause we hard on the mic, and we first to bust
You better use your brain, nigga we paid our dues
We Guerilla Maab 3D2, with nothing to lose
And everybody wanna say, it was all a dream
We popped up on the rise, now we on the scene
I can't take it no more, I gotta release my stress
Everybody wanna be hating, and bumping that mess
But I do suggest, you don't wanna get put to rest
Cause I'm bout to let loose, to cave in your chest
Resurrection Music Group, we for life
And a lot of you broads, gonna make us shife
Trae and Dougie D, forever be on the rise
In the mist of guerillas, don't play with your life

[Hook]
In the mist, of guerillas
Better hide, when you hear us
In the mist, of guerillas
It's too late, when you see us

[Dougie D]
In the mist, of some motherfucking guerillas
You niggaz better be hiding, whenever we riding we put the clip inside you dying
You fucking with some niggaz, that'll commit
A 187 homicide, and slide
And wrap you up, and put you off in the trunk
Or when a guerilla come with the effort, to remind that we stomp
All of my guerillas, are boffers and bump
It's too late when you see us, so you better turn to it before you dump
Trying to block I ain't playing no mo' caressing my glock, and I lock and I load
I ain't no killer, but the label the robe
Did you look at everything I see you rhyme, and move from my rhyme
Prolly, cause I'm bout to explode
I don't wanna see different combatters on, bullets when he see cords
And C4's, automatic rounds ever you done
Tell mama, I'm bringing the cows home
Cause in the mist of guerilla, and that's the way we ride what

[Trae]
A nigga kinda figured, a lot of y'all would hate us from the jump
Now give me the pump wanna be done, somebody bout to get dumped
See I done been through a lot of things, and never gonna be given up
And niggaz I was down with, I never thought they'd be nothing up
Now money is the root of all evil, and that's for real
And a lot of these people, don't even wanna wait they turn
That's why I steady choose to stick around, and walk with a frown
And let 'em know, I really don't need nobody to be down
And through all controversy, 3D2 is gon be the same
Up in the mist of guerillas, and we can make it through all of the pain
Through thick and thin, when we was stranded in the rain
We done put our heads together, to straight up conquer the game mayn
Leaving negativity, so that we can get paid
I ain't got no time to be letting, nobody hold us down
And as far as I'm concerned, nobody ever was being real
I think it's bout the time, that we let you know how we feel bitch

[Hook]

[Dougie D]
I think you better get your mind right, because the world goes round
No matter how bad you want it, it won't slow down
In the mind of a guerilla, we looking through bigger pictures
Stacking up figgas, and busting anybody trying to hold us down
Take a look, at the world I'm in
With niggaz killing niggaz, and all those killing niggaz will come to an end
Everybody talking bout a revolution
But the Maab marching and shooting, before they have our skins
Resurrection Music Group, the record label we pushing
So you knuckle head niggaz, gon feel that there
I remember hearing, that we weren't gon be nothing
Without us it was over, but I know you all ain't gon be there
Now we the ones that put the Maab, and the guerillas
So how do you figure, that you was gonna hide that there
And we Guerilla Maab for life, we got the scars and stripes
We'll get you in the mist, you'll find us there

[Hook]
