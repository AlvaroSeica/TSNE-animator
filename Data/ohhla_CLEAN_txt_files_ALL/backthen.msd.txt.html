Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Never forgot the day he came my way, hehe...
From the very first second he stole my heart
Tired to play hard to get
But I was hooked from the start
Acting grown, the things he'd say
When we were hand in hand walking in the park
My first kiss, first crush, first valentines card

So infatuated, so uncomplicated
Back then...
When love was just a smile
Memories though a window what I wouldn't give to go
Back then...
When love was just a smile

[Chorus]
Back in the day when love was so sweet
Funny how simple things used to be
Reminiscing on you and me
Take me back to my memories
Back in the day when love was so sweet
Funny how simple things used to be
Reminiscing on you and me
Take me back to my memories

He'd walk me home most days of the week
Hiding down the street so my mother couldn't see him
She woulda' give us a hell of a beating,
I remember, kiss chasing, heart racing
So weak when you'd look
Writing your name on my school books

Nervous, shy and shaking
Constant feelings racing
Back then...
I still hear my trembling voice,
Floating through the echoes
When I wouldn't give to go,
Back then...
When love was just a smile

[Chorus]
Back in the day when love was so sweet
Funny how simple things used to be
Reminiscing on you and me
Take me back to my memories
Back in the day when love was so sweet
Funny how simple things used to be
Reminiscing on you and me
Take me back to my memories

So infatuated, so uncomplicated
Back then...
When love was just a smile
Memories though a window what I wouldn't give to go
Back then...
When love was just a smile

[Chorus]
Back in the day when love was so sweet
Funny how simple things used to be
Reminiscing on you and me
Take me back to my memories
Back in the day when love was so sweet
Funny how simple things used to be
Reminiscing on you and me
Take me back to my memories

[Chorus]
Back in the day when love was so sweet
Funny how simple things used to be
Reminiscing on you and me
Take me back to my memories
Back in the day when love was so sweet
Funny how simple things used to be
Reminiscing on you and me
Take me back to my memories</pre>
