[Holocaust]
A snake killed a born, hunter killed the snake
Trace the sword that shatters the devil's sword great
The sword of orphans, the overlord's late
They say down in the pit, I slay a whore with hate
A white crow, you're doomed in bout, alone, I slay
Two teams of vampire soldiers, the cameras zooms in, zooms out
Bitch, I'm your dead eye, the Hidden Dragon
The Tiger Crouch, yo, champ, I'd rather fall on my sword
In my dark empire house, at the battle of Kikara corner, Japan
I killed forty of the greatest samurai, my clan has died
I've been poisoned many times, holy shark
Take a thousand in damage, then vanish
Hold beefers, swapping witch guns
A man was struck and killed by a man from Los Angeles, I'm number one

[Chorus: Holocaust]
Please come to challenge I, standing into the Twilight Zone
You know of terrifying thing, Arctic warrior
I swift gauge, my display, I switch blades
Know in the castle, evil person, I catch the bird this day

[Nova Kane]
Yeah, back and wack, cats who tried to hold me back
And came back around, now you fakes have to deal with that
Arrest a bat without wings, you cops, you ain't fly as that
Sideways your cap, twist your head around, hear the crack?
Breathing over tracks, Gauntlit's late, Steven Ree with raps
It's always on time, for our closet, falling stars in tact
In fact my time, chamber heals, all wounds and backstab
Fast tacks, I grab grab, pitch fast, so know that
No love lost to gain, pertain to a child's game
Feelings none, bitter pain, why they call me Nova Kane
Heartless from the start of this, marked by an angel's kiss
Forty days, forty nights, 2099 flooded shit
Stutter steps, micro reps, never ever disrespect
The hand that keeps you fed, yo, a lesson learn I guess
No flames in the furnace, feel the warmth of memories and said
Kill your old and gray, the thought of me would never rest

[Chorus 2X]

[Ace Gauntlit]
Sayonara to the blues, we infuse and brute the night hawk in treches
And so many pleasures, with partaking my Theatre of Pain
Creating and always sustain is doubted by clouded judgment
Leader tried to escape the torture and dungeon
Hoping for execution in my life, they start to say abuse the percussions
Without the reed, I.E., equip not up with no penalty V's
Scatter with your key in this hip pocket, locker call from the finest
Broken memories, illusionists escape, made traceless
Reshape the death of centuries, into a packed house, my spouse grossed out
Call the king out, true freedom is real
They say I dream about often, skies will darken
Throwing caution to the wind, they descend all
Back a block where your horse is
Secure positons, what's your intentions?
If he try to deny us, then spoil his royal ambitions
Thick skin is not enough, future listen, magician
Entire empires get crushed, then erased from existance

[Chorus 4X]</pre>
