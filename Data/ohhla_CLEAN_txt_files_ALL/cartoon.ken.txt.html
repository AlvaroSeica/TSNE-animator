[Intro: channel surfing samples]
"I want to hit line drives"
"Want to lose weight? Well keep eating..."
"For you"
"In my financial situation"
"Heeey, what's up Doc?"

[Chorus 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Now I was raised in a sandbox next to you and her
You was holding a handgun, she was giving birth
to a baby boy, to be just like you, I, I wonder what that's worth
I, I wonder if you, you ever knew you was a role model to me first
The next day I, I woke up in the morning, seen you on the news
Looked in the mirror, then realized that I, I, I had something to prove
You told me "Don't be like me, just finish watching cartoons"
which is funny now cause all I see is Wile E. Coyotes in the room

[Chorus 2: Kendrick Lamar] + (Gunplay)
And I run it "blow-blow-blow-blow!", and I run it "blow-blow-blow-blow!"
And I run it "yeah! blow!", and I run it "yeah! blow!"
That's ironic "blow-blow-blow-blow!", I run it "blow-blow-blow-blow!"
That's ironic "yeah-yeah! blow!", I run it "yeah! blow! yeah!"
(Salt all in my wounds
 Hear my tears all in my tunes
 Let my life loose in this booth
 just for you muh'fucker, hope y'all amused)
And I run it "blow-blow-blow-blow!", and I run it "blow-blow-blow-blow!"
And I run it "yeah-yeah! blow!", and I run it "yeah! blow!"
That's ironic

[Interlude: channel surfing samples]
"In my financial situation"
"With the liberation, his leader..."
"Popular pie plant pictured here"
"Wile E. Coyote! Wile E. Coyote!"

[Kendrick Lamar] - (Kendrick chants in the background "Elmer Fudd said, 'Shoot him down'")
This shit make a nigga just wanna write
Reminisce when I had the morning appetite
Apple Jacks and after that I hit the TV Guide
Animaniac the only thing that gave me peace of mind
I'm maniac when aiming at the enemy that lied
Tell a story that I'll never glory twenty-five
Not to worry, every warrior will come and see euphoria
That's a covenant I put on every tribe
Ain't nobody gon' tie your shoe
Nobody gon' abide by your rule
Nobody holding your gun
How come your tongue say killer, then kill my mood?
Light speed living in the world you know
Little old me, feeling like a live wire
Bet I put some new tires on a lightning bolt
till I wreck into a pole/poll like a right to vote
I am from the bottom of the jungle
Living in the bottom of the food chain
When you get a new chain, nigga take it from you
A new name, want stripes, and you a zebra lookalike
Hope another homicide don't numb you, and none do
Things we will never learn soon
In the era where we wanna earn soon, that's an error
You can smell it in the air, and everybody really doomed
That's why I'm backdooring you muh'fuckers, all y'all can suck my dick
All them days at the county building, now I'm bout to make my momma rich
Cartoons and (cereal), I ain't felt this (good since)
Scrooge McDuck, (here we go), elementary hood shit

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Kendrick Lamar] - (Kendrick chants in the background "Elmer Fudd said, 'Shoot him down'")
This shit make a nigga just wanna shit
on everybody, even with a pot to piss in
I'ma aim sloppy at a loud mouth, discharge
Dismiss any business of yours
Discounts never did amount to a check
that ya ass couldn't cash when the shit bounced
Everything dismounts, niggas gon' flip that car
AKs for the whole hood
House lick went down perfect
Two shots to the head, he deserved it
Overheard it in my bed with a bowl and remote control
Darkwing Duck lost service
Momma said I better duck, she's nervous
Drama all up in the cut, hit the curtains
I mean, don't intervene with no gun machine
This block stay jerking, the Feds stay lurking
Emerging on everybody corner, (dash for it)
Get a toe tag when you play tag with the task of a new (task force)
Everybody wanna know my life, how did I make it (past yours)?
Well let me tell you like this, I've been running this shit since I (asked for) 
cartoons and cereal

[Chorus 1]

[Kendrick Lamar]
And I run it

[Gunplay]
Salt all in my wounds
Hear my tears all in my tunes
Let my life loose in this booth
just for you muh'fucker, hope y'all amused
I did wrong, karma came
Crackers gave me ball and chain
Friends, enemies, all the same
State, Fed, both can hang
Nobody can mute me
But I never said nobody can't shoot me
Just another stat to the white folks
Still whip work to the white yolk, absolutely
Every day feel like the one before
Hunt the money, don't hunt the hoe
If you do what you always done
then you get what you always got, you dumb buffoons
I ain't seen the back of my eyelids
for bout the past seventy-two hours
Hand on my heart, face to the hood
I'll pledge every word you ever heard was honest
Yeah this me, no mic
No cameras, no lights
Just pain
Momma, how much trauma can I sustain?
Dirty money come with lots of stains
Road to riches come with lots of lanes
Just another player with lots of game
Never had shit, got lots to gain
Just another player with lots of game
Never had shit, got lots to gain!
