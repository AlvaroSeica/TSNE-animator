[Verse 1]
And so I felt that I could melt that ice that had sheltered round my
little heart
At age ten was dealt some brittle cards
So I looked to women to warm me up
I put a note in her cubby
"I think I like like you
If you like like me check the box next to yes and we could be tight"
She said yes Â– success!
I was quite hyped
It's the fifth grade
I was Adam, she's my rib cage
I was an atom, she's the membrane
I wasn't that obsessed with slap bracelets
Ok, yes I was, and yes I had braces
I even fronted like I cared about stickers
Fuzzies and oilies, the girls were all about em
At lunch my table was always crowded
"Watch me spin this dreidle!" I shouted

if music be the food of love, then play on x4

[Verse 2]
I got older
Writin this girl's name on my folder
I told her the same thing I tell you
And that's everything
Writin poetry so she'll notice me hopefully
Girls gettin bagged like groceries
But to me that ain't the way that it's supposed to be
Introduced my best friend to the love of my life
And then they started dating, and it fucked up my life for a minute
became a bit of a cynic
Wasn't in it to win it
And I dressed like dennis the menace on the apprentice if he was
playing tennis against a dentist in Venice
Ok now I'm exaggerating a tad
Graduatin from masterbatin was rad
The fascination of imagination had passed
But my high school was frightful
the vibe, it was sad
And college?
I think you've heard enough about that

if music be the food of love, then play on x4

[Verse 3]
If love is blind then I was Hellen Keller
Or Anne Frank
A cellar dweller afraid from independence
For years she seemed so heaven sent
But it was evident that merriment was missing
We were each other's medicine and vision
I stayed reticent and wishing
That we would be the couple that I knew we could be
She was me again, we grew equally
But we also grew apart
Sayin peace isn't easy, but shit, sometimes it's gotta happen
This was round the time that I started hitting stages
Now girls approachin me as if I was rich and famous
But the fact is I was still switching phases
An ignoramus, now I'm playin the field
I'm just playin a game, these girls're playin for real
Maybe ain't the way it should be just the way that I feel
