[Verse 1]
Yo yo, I hate those filthy fuckin' monkeys
And the features that they share with simians
Disgusting junkies, welfare recipients
They livin' off of someone's money who pays tax and has a life
While these black bitches stomachs stay fat with parasites
And they have to have a pipe to relax on average nights
So their bastard bratty tykes all act like savage types
It's the legacy of black and Spanish guys
Beg when ?tea and genoas? complacency of dads who have no wives
Police should beat their fuckin' skulls in with magnum lights
Illegitimate illiterate black should have no rights
Cuz they go from having lives to having life
And I pay to feed their appetites and give them TV's with satellite
Those steven-stealing dirty fuckin' heathens dealing dope need to steal a boat
And sail their monkey asses back to Africa
And seal the coast with giant gates made of steel and bolts
So we can try and save the decent white god-fearing folk

[Chorus]
And I got strangers moving in in my own backyard
Hometown battlefield, times is hard
Crime is risin', on my horizon
And it's getting mighty hard for folks to find a job
A lot of folks say that the times is changing
But the more things change, the more they stay the same
And I don't know where I'm gonna go, I don't know, I don't know

[Verse 2]
Don't hand me your ethics, just credit this as rude hard speech
Cuz I'm not anti-Semitic, Jews are cheap
With every breath their breathing through large beaks
They're telling more fibs and squeezing four kids into two car seats
What a waste of white skin, heartbeats and faces like men
Nigger lovers who treat the beast as if the ape was like them
They killed to save your Christ and denied that he was God's seed
It doesn't come as a surprise that meet the Nazi's
I live to see the day that Rabbi's decree their cocks reclipped at birth
'Till there ain't a Jewish dick that works
We should take care of the rich half first on Hanukkah
And smother out their breath and words with yamakas
'Till they turn to vomiters choking on their manichevitz
Menorahs to the foreheads would make some handy weapons
'Cuz there's no room for Plandess, Goldberg, and Blooms
We'll just wipe them off the face of the earth

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
You know who probably hurts us most
Those sneaky guys with chinky eyes and the turban folks
Godheads who settle on our urban coast
I wish that they would drop dead, buying up convenience stores and restaurants
Either or they sneaking and I'm tired of the lenient laws
Treatin' them like real Americans when after all
These rice eating heathens even eat their cats and dogs
And that's because their misers, fucking cabbies in a hurry
Covered in the stench of curry, and they're awful drivers
The law provides us with no means of protection
Not even a weapon to stop the evil conception
And my people are threatened by the rate at which they multiply
Alarming enough to make the true patriots pulses high
Cult is like worship, Hindu and Buddhist rituals
Our lord Christ returning is grave due to his principles
The way they're taking bread from the truly blessed sons
I have to say the only good brown and yellow folks are dead ones

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
I'd like to add lastly, AIDS ain't a disease
We should take tainted IV's and jam up the pillow-biting fags ass cheeks
And dykes are twice as bad what kinda woman doesn't like to shag
No dick for those chicks, what kinda life is that?
We got mar tsars fighting for the rights of drag queens and queers
Who's sperm's on like germ farms breeding fear
The fucking fairies need braziers, high heels, and dick
The stuff so scary to even hear it I'm feeling sick
Your body parts got a right feeling fit, silly fairy
Nobody wants fags and dykes to join the military
We'd be better off killing every bitchy lesbian
And wimpy feminine men than to let them in
Then again I know it seems like I'm the devil's riding henchmen
But no one on this earth loves all of god's inventions
Not to mention, I got a date to try and talk to Satan
And lots of tension, cuz I'm late for my inauguration

[Beat stops]

[Man talking]
Right this way, Governor Bush</pre>
