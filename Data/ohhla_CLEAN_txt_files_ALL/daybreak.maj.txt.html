[Madam Majestic]
Daybreak... how can I ever leave this place beside you...
You were the only one I ever cried to...
The night is through, and now, it's heartache
I should be home before he sees it's daybreak
Light from the sky is shining, through the curtain ways
I see your face, and now it's daybreak...
Daybreak... daybreak... daybreak...
Daybreak... how can I ever leave this place beside you...
You were the only one I ever cried to...
The night is through, and now, it's daybreak
How can I ever leave this place beside you...
You were the only one I ever cried to...
The night is through
How can I ever leave...
