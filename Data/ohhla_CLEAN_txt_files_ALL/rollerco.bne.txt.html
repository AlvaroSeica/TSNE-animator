[Intro: Layzie] + (Bizzy)
Blaze this baby, we gon' get high
(Yeah, yeah, Layzie Bone, Bizzy Bone, yes sir)
Bone Brothers baby, 2000 and ten figures (infinity)
Kickin a little bit of that universal love, ya dig?

[Chorus: Layzie Bone]
We go up, we go down, we go round, we go round
Come and take a look at our life
We go up, we go down, we go round, we go round
Come and take a look at our life
We ride the rollercoaster (hey) ride the rollercoaster (hey)
Ride the rollercoaster (hey) of liiiiife
Ride the rollercoaster (hey) ride the rollercoaster (hey)
Ride the rollercoaster (hey) of liiiiife

[Bizzy Bone]
Through all the ups and downs, town to town, city to city, holy ground
Lower half, Milky Way, silkin it like Doug and Dave
Westside feel me when we play, what's the dealio?
Silly to try Bizzy, he's a pistol packer, is he? No
Better believe it leave it, heat it B, it's nothin but a thug thang
Buck buck, what the fuck? Baby boy's blessin me
Reap all the while, bless to the pile, shine in yo' glory
No faces, no stories, they saints, and we'll go or we
There'll be heavy mortems, maximum Lay and B, they be smashin 'em
Ghetto fashions, unfasten yo' eyes, sing on the acronym
Castin them demons out of us, crowdin to see what's found in us
Rationalize the movement, keep groovin and movin soundin us
Roundin us, un-profoundin us, moundin us, still pictures
Pictures, quicker, swifter, bounty hunters I'm wit'cha
Through the ups and downs, round for round, now I live with Christ
Yes, this is the second God and praise God for life

[Chorus]

[Bizzy Bone]
Now where do we come from? Hollow point mixed with dum-dum
Ride on the level with the rhythm when I'm rockin shh
nobody can stop it when we deeply come
Now, better get your money mayne, better get your dollar dollars
Gotta get down for my thang cause that ring'll literally finger swallow
Pound for pound, round for round, outta my mind now
Huh, I don't know the time, the Lord is with you, you can shine now
Grind now, climb now, trigger tai chi, pow pow!
Lil' Lay it's goin down, you should bust your rhyme now

[Layzie Bone]
Look at us, breakin up to make up, when it occurs it all seemed tragic
Maybe it's a blessin in disguise cause man them boys is back at it
It's like magic, Christ with passion, tribulations is fastin
Now the whole world thuggin and buggin, to the music that's classic
Through the static, sometimes sporatic, some days when I'm laggin
I fall down, but I get up and I can still get it crackin
Give me action with satisfaction, couple of moments of laughin
You know the ones that get me through this precious life that I'm passin

[Chorus]

[Layzie Bone]
L-Burna baby...
We suffer and struggle through many of things
I'm countin my blessings, fulfillin my dreams
I treasure my life and the love that it brings
I give it all up to my heavenly king
Know what I mean? Ridin and rollin
My hands in the air when I'm movin I'm coastin
I'm leavin a legacy where they are toastin
Ten toes to the earth I'm posted
And I come from America, mass hysteria
Niggaz get caught in the scandal
It's the land of the free, but baby believe me
they're quick to make an example
Mike Vick got his contract cancelled
T.I. tried to buy protection
But where was the push on Bush?
Fake president stole the whole election
Then they took our children to war (war)
They over there fightin for oil (oil)
America's so damn spoiled (spoiled)
Kinda makin my temperature boil (boil)
Damn right I'ma ride for the poor (poor)
until they even the score (score)
Y'all better just open the door (door)
We comin to kick it in wantin some more

[Chorus] Â– 2X</pre>
