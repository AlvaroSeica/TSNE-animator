I'm focused on trying to stay focused
In '06  I dealt with some blows now the process
Of sorting thru these ghosts can feel hopeless
Its bogus but it still gets under the skin like osmosis
Yo this world's so sick
Like ne-yo's hit o folks with no OHIP
Don't slip
Know who the staff you roll with is
Your staff can turn to snakes like moses'
And motives get exposed quick
When cash is grossed so don't trip
No sum is worth what your soul is
No sun immersed in the coldness
No son, reverse like the poles
Get past the bitterness out the standstill
It wasn't in the cards
Some ppl can't deal
Play the hand youre dealt
Might make a grand still
A man's real if we can return like grant hill

Those that know shad know that hes on his own path
Like a nomad rolling without a roadmap
Just 4 lads in a topaz with no gas
I call my car rocafella cuz its got a broke dash
My generation's movin so fast
Runnin like old taps
From fear and stress and tears choked back
Boys hold gats while the girls got no strap
On their dresses and wont eat 'less its low-fat
Between low-cut tops and teeth with gold caps
That new school look's more crazy than OCAD's
When theres no dads to say don't show that
Make em look in your eyes, your mind's where the show's at
And you need more than beats for a dope track
Even with more hooks than a coat rack
And more hot lines than 1-800 phones
That's why most cats in this rap game just don't last
Its not vocab they need to grow its go nads
And back bone so they can speak and not hold back
We need folks with faith that's gon last
To teach the younger ones how to live with no mask
And pose the kind of questions that most just wont ask
And keep that hope stashed like a safe of cold cash
Our vision for the future cnt fade or go black
Like some Kodak pictures at night with no flash
Them cats be pollutin the air like smoke stacks
Let the freshness in get your windows cracked</pre>
