Song:   I Love Somebody
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Have you no shame?
Have you no shame?
You keep saying that you miss me
Have you no aim?
Used to walk around everywhere
Now we fly flames
So many years of paradise and so much has changed
Don't know if you're ready or no
Truth can't be a lot to end all
Now someone's laying in your spots
So it's time you blew out the candles

And I know it's hard to believe that I
Could possibly love somebody else
But I love somebody else
Go ahead and look me deep in my eyes
Time didn't do us well
'Cause I love somebody else yeah

Are you mad? Are you mad?
I was tune, but all that past
I was used, I was trashed
But now you came back at the all is cash
The famous gold get the story right
She like I'm on my own nigga waiting from me silent
I found it new when I was be more
One who told me baby you could be more
Now I'm taking up in Dior
Walking out before
5, 6, 7, 8, 9 bags like see you
Came a long way from the key all
So will have to go on top of another G or
Part of Americans but the pain [?] is the way that you carry yourself
When you inherit and inherit
When you're sharing you well with someone you love
But it's like you're shining yourself
Pasrts to relate, it's not for debate
You see all this ice, too bad you gotta skate
You gotta make you my wife
You to have me by the grapes
Now I'm spending my nights, going through bottles of ace
Look of how it tastes
Like victory, and you're more like history
The old shit, told me shit to me
So it's all officially.

It's hard to believe that I
Could possibly love somebody else
But I love somebody else
Go ahead and look me deep in my eyes
Time didn't do us well
'Cause I love somebody else yeah

L president
This love
Turn the light</pre>
