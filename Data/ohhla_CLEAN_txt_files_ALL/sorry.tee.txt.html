[T.I.]
My cup runneth over in Pinot Grigio, hold up
You bogus in that Lambo if ye ain't liftin the do' up
You bogus poppin pills if ye ain't pickin the hoe up
You bogus runnin out on your kids, my nigga grow up
For God's sake, like a wedding cuttin large cake
For large stakes let the hammer bang broad day
Ay, never mind what the blogs say
This what my mind and my heart say
My philosophy profit off of my properties
Get it, flip it, we got to be rich, that broke shit is obsolete
Possibly off of my rocker, watch how you watchin me
Sophisticated, psychotic; fly as a pilot
Officially solid, all you wish you could get I got it
Unlimited titanium nigga, "What's in yo' wallet?"
Out of gladiator college I made it summa cum laude
Where you clowns couldn't have got a cap and gown if you bought it
I parlay with Saudis, buyin crude oil and diamonds
Hustle January, July, fly to Dubai
A broke nigga tellin me 'bout how I'm dividin the pies
Like a blind nigga tellin me it's an eye for an eye
Bull-headed and stubborn, I'll be that way 'til I die
But find a nigga with more hustle than me I dare you to try
And accordin to the hand on my Audemar
It's my time to shine, so fuck y'all

[Chorus]
What should I be sorry for?
Who should I be sorry to?
What should I be sorry for?
Who should I be sorry to? Ooh
The fact is you can't please everybody
You can't please everybody
What should I be sorry for?
Who should I be sorry to?

[T.I.]
I grew up in the gutter, life a muh'fucker
I guess that's why I don't trust a muh'fucker
Seen a nigga snitch on they mom, shoot at they brother
Go to prison in love with a bitch and a nigga fuck her
I seen real G's destroyed by real suckers
Innocent ladies raped and defenseless, babies abducted
Such a horrible truth but you see it over and over
It's nothing, get numb to it and your heart grow colder
Pacify your pain with a chain and a Rover
Fuck it, justify your actions with stackin your dough up
He show up with a brick of cocaine and baking soda
Just enough for me to blow up, nigga hold up
Switch the flow up cause these niggaz be snitchin so much
I promise all they missin's a badge, coffee and donut
Go to jail, so what? Never see my integrity perish
That ain't the Harris' way, study my pedigree
Promise I'm one of the only ones who keep it a hun'ned
Probably why I think they all out to get me, you can't convince me
Large money and fame will plant seeds of envy
To make my partners resent me enough to come and get me
Catch me slippin and hit me just like they did 50
Cause I'm in the position that he think he should be given
Listen, dawg, the fact of the matter is
I'm on a narrow path and we all can't trap

[Chorus]

[André 3000]
What it ain't, what it is? Even if you gotta live
I learned that apartment's way more excitin than a big-ass house on the hill
I used to be a way better writer and a rapper when I used to want a black Karmann Ghia
Now a nigga speedin in a Porsche; feelin like I'm goin off a course
Cut these fuck niggaz off negative in my life, scream that 'til I'm hoarse
Duck these get-the-fuck-off-me projectiles, bitch you ain't really got a choice
I'm livin my life, live yours, I don't even like rappin fast
But that's how the world come to me, talk to me sideways nigga that's yo' ass
Slow it down - this that shit that'll make you call your momma
Say "Hey I'm sorry for beggin for all them clothes you couldn't afford"
And this the type of shit that'll make you call your rap partner
and say "I'm sorry I'm awkward, my fault for fuckin up the tours"
I hated all the attention so I ran from it (I ran from it!)
Fuck it if we did, but I hope we ain't lose no fans from it (no fans from it!)
I'm a grown-ass kid, you know I ain't never cared 'bout no damn money
Why do we try so hard to be stars, just to dodge comets?
And this that shit that'll make you call your baby mama
When you gone on half a pill, don't know why but that's how it is
Then you take a flight back to the crib, y'all make love like college kids
And you say all the shit you gon' do better, we can try this shit again
'Round the time the dope wear off, you feel stupid, she feel lost
That's that dope I mean, I mean Dopamine, you think Cupid done wore off
Waitin in the hallway with her arms crossed, your baby boy face full of applesauce
Maybe should've stayed but it ain't yo' fault, too much pressure I peel off
I'm sorry, 'twas young and had to choose between you
and what the rest of the world might offer me, shit what would you do?
Well I'd probably, do it differently if second the chance
Only if some cool-ass older man would've let me know in advance
This-this quarry, that is dug so deep, in a father's chest
When he feel that he's broken up his nest and he figured shit he was just doin the best
that he could, which end up bein the worst that he could
And all some pussy nigga on the internet can say is that verse ain't good
It's boring? Boring?
... Really? Hahaha
Well I'm disgusted with this world and, I can hardly breathe
and, told so many lies don't, know what to believe
I discussed it with this girl and, this is what she said
She said, "Lay down baby, baby rest your weary head"
I love these distractions but my mind don't wanna rest
But my body disagrees so I laid upon her breasts, yes
Ooooh you're, so fuckin fine
I, woke up the next mornin with new purpose on my miiiiiiind
Ooooooh, who pulls your ponytaillllll?
Who knows your body welllllll?
Huh?

[Outro]
What should I be sorry for?
Who should I be sorry to?</pre>
