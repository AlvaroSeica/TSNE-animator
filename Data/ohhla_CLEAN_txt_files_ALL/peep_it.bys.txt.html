(? Only if or-bay ou-yay ?) answer check it out
But 'check it out's played when you speak it
(? Ou-say I need the an-tay ou-tay al-tay all of ou-yay ou-tay ?)

Peep it, peep it (girlie)
Peep it, peep it (fella)
Peep it, peep it (sometime)
Peep it, peep it (and peep the rhyme y'all)
Peep it, peep it (girlie)
Peep it, peep it (fella)
Peep it, peep it (sometime)
Peep it, peep it

Shockin (sho you right, sho you right)
Non-stoppin (sho you right, sho you right)
That's the way (sho you right, sho you right)
We're rockin (sho you right, sho you right)
Shockin (sho you right, sho you right)
Non-stoppin (sho you right, sho you right)
That's the way (sho you right, sho you right)
We're rockin (sho you right, sho you right)

[ Boogie Knight ]
My name is Boogie Knight
The chilly girls I like
Got the juicy lips when I kiss you
I use the ivory soap
Bein clean's no joke
When you're lookin crumby people diss you
[ Romeo JD ]
My name is Romeo, I like to rock the show
Act frantic when I do it
We're headin for the top, so if you wanna rock
We're gonna break it down, so get to it

[ Boogie Knight ]
Go, go, go Boogie Knight
(Go Boogie Knight, go Boogie Knight, go)
Peep it, because these things people peep
Like a fly, fly girl walkin down the street
Like a big car crash or a hell of a fight
Or a movie that you catch 12 o'clock at night
Like a hustler on the street tryin to run the game
Or a girl who's fake tellin you the wrong name
I'm Boogie Knight from Harlem town
And I peep what's goin down
I suggest you peep it

Peep it, peep it (someone's girlfriend)
Peep it, peep it (food in the oven)
Peep it, peep it (peep the time)
Peep it, peep it (and peep the rhyme y'all)

[ Romeo JD ]
(Go Romeo, go Romeo, go)
What I promote is for you all to listen close
Because I want this rhyme to be truly self-explanatory
So I demand it and I planned it so that you can understand it
Comprehension is a must and yes it's mandatory
Out of the cage and in a rage the final stage is in effect
And in this rhyme the fact is to be stipulated
To my position on a mission and I'm wishin
That my points somehow can be rhythmically articulated
So pay attention while I mention my intention
No lyin, I'm tryin, I could never be a quitter, boss
So just hush cause I'm excusin to rush
Cause Rome Knight is kinda crush 
And that's the point I'm tryin to get across

Peep it, peep it (say what)
Peep it, peep it (some bird)
Peep it, peep it (get up on it)
Peep it, peep it (tatoo)

Peep it
Peep it 
Peep it
Peep it</pre>
