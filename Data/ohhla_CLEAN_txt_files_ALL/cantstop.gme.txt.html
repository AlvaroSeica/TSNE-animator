[Verse One]
Who's gonna stop me when I'm dribbel in the rock
Even coaches tell their big man, to move out the middle when
I'm cuttin through the key, blow pass you and proof your D.
Your in the zone I'll shoot the three
You ain't man to man I'll shake the mascot of your jersey
And leave you in the stands with fans
All the players on the bench like: "He aint dunkin.."
But when the kid flies through the lane the D. ain't jumpin
He can't stop me, it's too eazy, cross over of the glass windmill for sheezy
If he double team I'll jam on both of ya
Cluck your back, make you and your man a poster
And1 stay in your coach-up
Even he knows I'm gonna hit both of the freak dose
And I'm on D.
You can find me around the boards
You know how we play E.A. 2004

[Chorus] (Scratches)
Who's gonna stop me when I'm dribble in the rock
The Game in a frap rag
He can't stop me, it's too easy
The Game in a frap...frap rag
Who's gonna stop me when I'm dribble in the rock
The Game in a frap...frap rag
You can't....can't stop me
Cluck your back, make you and your man a poster

[Verse Two]
It don't matter if it's practise or franchise mode
I'll get three, standing backwards with my Dumars clothes
We can be on a home court, or out on the road
I'm outta control, tomahawk
Get outta that hoe
I'm realer than most players, when I'm in the post player
It don't matter, sky hook or ?? the roll-lay-up
When I'm puttin the J. up
You'll better have a hand on my chest
Or the soft-leather is going straight through the net
It ain't about ofence, I'll play D. in a post
So quick your pointguard'll think he's seeing a ghost
With the ball in the third row everytime I'll block-shot
There's gonna be a turnover, they ain't watchin the shot-clock
Throw the alley-hoop I'ma dunk with a lean in and
Steal the inbound pass, the rock can get my team in it
And I don't care about stats aslong as my team's winning
And we're celebrateing in the locker room when we finish

[Chorus]</pre>
