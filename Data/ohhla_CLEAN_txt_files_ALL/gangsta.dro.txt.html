[Young Dro Talking]
(Gangsta repeated in background)
I'm feelin' this nigga
Is this what they want it to sound like?
I know its our first time out and e'rything
But you want to hear it like this?
On the first go around?  ok?
This is what its supposed to sound like!

[Hook]
Gangsta, Soldier, 44 'tota
Young Dro, yea but I'm goddamn growed up
10 a Ki now, got the whole block sewed up
E'rybody smokin' me, kush nigga roll up

[Talking]
Hold up Drama, I smell some sticky shit in the air
Give me a second to light this shit up right here
Yea, now we're smokin'
Now we ready
The room gettin' real cloudy and shit!

[Hook] 2x

[Verse 1]
Heyy, where you at?
I'm ridin' through the A
I don't know where to turn to
Ya'll look thirsty
My cutlass looks like carrot juice
Colt .42, fuck ridin' I'ma burn dude
The mob don't concern you
We cleaner than your [??] do
Money ain't a thing
Bitch I'm straighter than a perm boo
20 80 shots
Ridin' tall me and [??] too
Tall like Drizzle
Hey bitch you gotta learn too
Nigga say he underground
I'ma send my burner through
I know where they live at
I know where they kill at
I know where they deal at and
I know where the pills at
24/5 whole thing that forreal black
Ain't no short numbers for all you shortcomings
Take the strap off the chain
Bitch we beat like Drama
You ball for 2 days
We ball the whole summer
I came back flippin' bricks
Bitch I do numbers
Gangsta, Gangsta
All you get is drama nigga

[Hook] 2x

[Verse 2]
Who am I?
Young Dro, I'm supreme
I'm a lotta shit
I buy a lotta bricks
To ride in my Impala with
Caught em buy shotty shit
My car look like an Oreo
Brown paint, white guts
Ma [??]
Son of the Holy Ghost
Try me its ground beef
Shoot a nigga in the back of the eye with the 9 heat
Niggas came to find me
My trigga finna mount you
Black belt ninja shit
I'm flippin' up yo house too
Kill 'em Dro
I'm bout to
Benz I got brown coupes
C-4 by the pounds
I'll make a nigga house move
I know all about you
You full off a mouthful
I can eat a city and a state
And drink the whole plate
Ride around with [??]
88's OK, big dick specialist
28's OK, told 'em bout the F-6
Bitches and ride terrificly
Bitch say she don't like Dro
Why the fuck you sniffin' me?

[Hook] 2x

[Verse 3]
Ride wit' me shorty
While I let they +Shoulda Lean+ play
White people like me
I'm on MTV with Green Day
Green ice, green K
+Packers+ like the +Green Bay+
King nigga cause my birthday on Martin Luther King Day
Yea, I gotta charge 'em cause I'm rippin' out a stingray
Check Cous out, he overseas swimmin' with a stingray
Rollin' off a Beem OK
Wife be lookin' mean OK
I ain't really mad
I'm just grindin' on my teeth OK
Chevy paint tropical
A Ween Away A Weem Away
Got 'em callin' FEMA
Cause the Choppers on Katrina Spray
My connect is so sweet
Jacob watch on me today
I'm hard I don't need to play
With grams and a .3 today
Ya'll should check me
And [??] got that evil yay
I'ma be a soldier, man
And I'ma keep it G today
20-60 wet paint
These hoes 'round wit' me today
Bubble Kush, eyes is red
its hard for me to see today

[Hook] 2x</pre>
