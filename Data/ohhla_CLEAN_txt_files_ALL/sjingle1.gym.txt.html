[Travie McCoy]
Bartender!
  Yeah I hears your wise ass, gimme a minute
I'm tryin to get this round over here
  What do you think I'm just workin for you here?
Actually, will you... will you send a drink
to the lady at the end of the bar? Yeah that one right there
  Here you are miss
Yeah, yeah - it's on me, tell her it's from Travie
  It's from this guy over here
From the second she shimmied in
I was intrigued by her essence
And my first instincts to make sure that my presence was felt
Simple and plain
I'm probably jumpin the train
But all I could see was my name engraved on her belt
Hit the pause button - damn!!
I don't even know this girl
And I'm already practicing my sweet-nothings
But that's a classic trait of a
soft-spoken, heart-broken, fellow like my self best believe
  Pussy!
I tend to wear my heart on my sleeve
But that night - the Jagermeister had my sleeves rolled up
Wait a minute, hold up
I think she caught me grillin, now I'm spillin my drink
I knew our feelings were in sync so now she gave me the wink
The only problem is, I'm not your ordinary average Romeo
A Cyrano de Bergerac
  Man shut the fuck up!
In fact - I remember back in fifth grade
I tried to read the book of love but sadly
The introduction didn't grab me
So I left it on the shelf and kept moving
Assuming that this planet rotates
I'll just procrastinate until the day I bump into my soulmate
Who woulda thunk I'd be pissy-ass drunk when time came for collision?
So I made the decision to just keep my composure
  Cool, cool
Until she started gettin closer
And then I felt this weird feeling underneath my left shoulder
Then I - slipped, tripped, busted my lip and fell in love
The minute that she stepped through the door
The type of girl I'd have to make a couple mixtapes for
To me she, equalled MC squared
and everything else was mathematics
I never took the time to practice</pre>
