(Unknown girl~Lil' Keke)
Dreamin, Dreamin
uh I want you, I want you
come on yea I want you
I want you come on yeah
Dreamin, Dreamin
uh I want you, I want you
come on yea I want you
I want you come on yeah

(Verse One: Lil' Keke)
I aint gon' lie girl it must be somethin bout you
cause we aint knew each other long and you already my boo
I like your style you try to be mad, I make you smile
you lay up under my arms like a new born child
I'm thinking back to my teenage love, my teenage life
how I use to say that I aint gon' do this twice
but I'm a man now it cant get better or worse
and I know its hard to understand that my baby is first
but I got family to provide for, put shit aside for
you know its people in the world I'd die for
so whats you're plan?, I'm not a full time man
but I'm doing what I can maybe you'll understand
but its alright sugar so let you're feelings hang out
cause when I'm diggin deep inside I know you like it alot
I got this thug passion to put you in the mood
and then you hear my cell ring, you catchin a attitude
lets set da record straight you knew what it was from da start
and I'm just the typa nigga that'll mess up ya heart
we spent nights together, we took flights together
and if I wanted to see the world you was down for whatever
I'm ya lover man, cant be ya other man
aint no tellings when you aint gon' find another man
I'm a be dreamin so wont you please come true
cause everytime I close my eyes I swear I see you, dreamin

(Chorus~unknown girl~Lil' Keke)
If this is a dream please come true
cause when I close my eyes
I see you(I see you)
If this is a dream please come true
cause when I close my eyes
I see you(I see you)

(Verse Two: Lil' Keke)
Lets get ya mind right cause I'm on another page
looking for quaility time I live on the stage
thats ya stress look I want ya best look
ya long hair, high heels, short skirt, but deep dress
look you gotta man so you need to kick back
and u said ya really love him aint nothin wrong wit dat
so whats the deal? with the sad thing, the mad thing?
everytime you see a nigga you talkin bout a change
you needa chill, relax, and be cool up on da real
keep ya head focused so you know what it is
but u been down for a minute tho you aint da average ho
aint no need to lie its gon' be hard to let u go
lets take it slow and not to fast girl this is thug world
chocolate, and vanilla thats a hell of a swirl
holdin hands up on the beach you use to love that shit
shoppin sprees in New york you know we stayed in a mink
you doin 9-to 5, you know I do it live
and when you layin down and sick thats when I come beside
this aint no perfect match and it might not happen
just to give it to you straight I'm in love wit rappin
thats alright though I'm tryna get mo
I made my way up to the front, and out the back do'
and just to let you know that I'm still the same
we was friends from the start it aint gon' never change,dreamin

(chorus till end) </pre>
