Dre:
Hittman,2000

[Verse 1 (Dre)]
Comin and stompin,its Hitt from Bronson
In collaboration wit Dre from Compton
Huh,I came to say a lil sumthin (Hittman,2000)  
Hittman +At Your Service+
Highly intensive tounge talents makin all nervous
Y'all fakin,a full nine wit my rhymes on purpose
Y'all hatin,puffin wit Dre y'all nervous
Y'all waitin,anticipatin
My arrival California survialist
Smash on any man rival dis
Blast on anyone who dont ride wit Hitt
Y'all betta buy my shit
I said buy,not bite my shit
Rappin since '85 think I dont write my shit?
Bitch!,get off my dick!

Hook:
Yes deez are,Last Dayz of-my-life
For our ways (For mine,I want all y'all to say dat nigga) -
Hittmans tight (Well I'll Bee Back!)
Got damn right
Deez are,Last Dayz of-my-life
For our ways (Fo mine,I want all y'all to say dat nigga) -
Hittmans tight (Well I'll Bee Back!)

[Verse 2]
Get on dis verse wit a video endin
Was anyone offended,by how I shitted?
Im tha real Hitt,aint no pretend bitch
Rubber grip ten clips,fo starters
When H-I double T spit,so time fo Marters
New colors and 4 fibres -
You want gun of tha unknown author
(??),half-way hampton
Dressed like a Se-al,sent to hit Charles Mansion
Manscun hand cov'rage,straight villin
Make killins,but when Im chillin
Hoes say Hittman's a handsome muthafucka
Granitest tha grants to make em fam brothers
Fuck romance,Im a ransom lover
I bag rich bitches,gag em,n tie em up to one-another
(Hittman aight) Im tight enuff to be discovered
By tha WestCoast's,tops,nigga
Tha same guy who found Eminem,Snoop &amp; Doc
In 2000,H marks tha spot
See Im tha first Hittman,y'all niggaz tryna be tha next Pac
That's were ya lost
Fuck around n get your ass nailed to a cross
If rap was football I would be Randy Moss
Tha hottest nigga favorite cocktail's Molatov
Niggaz callin Aftermath like Dre call em of
(Call em off,call em off,call em off)
Im tha reason why ya fallen of
(Fallen off x8)
Hitt-man is,a goin up
