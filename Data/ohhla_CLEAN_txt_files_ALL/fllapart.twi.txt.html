[Jamie Madrox]
I swallow razor blades and spit up blood
Cut out my heart and gave it to my love
I hung myself with an extension cord
And dangled high above the Ouiji board
I heard the wind through the trees and I made me scream
I'm wonderin' if it's real life or just another dream
I need somethin', someone
To help me with my brain because it's fallin' apart
I fall apart

[Hook]
I'm fallin' to peices and I don't know why
(It's all because) It's all because we're all afraid to die
(And if you think) And if you think about it, it'll eat you
&gt;From the inside out 'til you don't know what to do


[Monoxide Child]
You fall apart!
I'm drinkin' gas, smokin' square after square
I'm lookin' for this place but I don't know where
I'm just a soul in the land of the lost
I feel the blood in my lungs when I cough
I cut my hands off in the dark and just sat there and bled
While the whole world fell apart inside of my head
I need somethin', someone
To help me with my brain because it's fallin' apart
I fall apart

[Hook]

[Jamie Madrox]
I cut my rib cage open with a, butcher knife
And open up the hole to show my life
I'm not the devil but your mama swear we're one and the same
And we didn't make it this way so we're not carryin' the blame
I've been down and out
I know what that's, all about

[Monoxide Child]
I need somethin', someone
Help me wit' my brain, help me wit' my brain
I need somethin', someone
Help me wit' my brain, help me wit' my brain
I need somethin', someone
Help me wit' my brain, help me wit' my brain

[Hook]

[Monoxide Child]
Jumped out a 20 story window today
I got back up and then I walked away
My head was screamin' for a Tylenol
Openned the bottle and I ate 'em all
My head was spinning, dazed and I need to relax
So where's my chainsaw, butcher knife, and motherfucking axe?!?
Somethin', someone
To help me wit' my brain cuz it's fallin' apart
I need somethin', someone
To help me wit' my brain cuz it's fallin' apart
I fall apart

[Hook]x2

[Jamie Madrox]x5
I keep fallin' apart
I never wanted to die
I keep fallin' apart</pre>
