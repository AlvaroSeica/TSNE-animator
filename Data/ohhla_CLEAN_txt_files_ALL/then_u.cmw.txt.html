[BOOM BAM]
I spent my life gettin' high
(Time passin' me by)
You catch me talkin' to myself
(I'm steady askin' me why)
Then I live more productive
But in this game of life a game with no instructions (what's up)
That's why I'm livin' to the best of my ability
Come find through my facility
Ain't tryin' to keep a nigga from killin' me (pop! pop!)
Y'all niggas is feelin' me
That's why I packs a burner
Ready to stoop you young punks (what?)
You ready to learn a - lesson
Consider yourself lucky, count your blesses
Cause homie you ain't to work my stress and (boom!)
You see I'm fresh on probation
For six month
With no blunts I'm havin' patience
Time is wastin'
I could be facin' 25 with a L
But I be damned if I'm spendin' the rest of my life in jail
I'm glad I was able to make bail
The postman back on the street collectin' mail

Life is get your money whether is do or die
Come get your money, get honey and get real high
Struggle like a muthafucka sometimes you cry
Then you gone
Life is get your money whether is do or die
Get your money, get honey and get real high
Struggle like a muthafucka sometimes you cry
Then you gone
C'mon
Yeah - ye-ye-ye-ye-ye, yeah, yeah then you gone (hey)
Ye-ye-ye-ye-ye, yeah, yeah then you gone (hey, c'mon)
Ye-ye-ye-ye-ye, yeah, yeah singin' y'all uh
Yeah - ye-ye-ye-ye-ye, yeah, yeah (hey)

Niggas get ready for the last days
Time just need, time that cry
You won't be around next year
I wish my pops was still here
I know the path, the walk instead the
Walk the path where bodies lined in chalk (hey)
Another sad song's on the same
But another young lad done joined the game (geah)
Ain't nuthin' changed
Strange days passed me by
So I let some pass everyday real high
Always ?wonderind life's alive?
So I patch my bags
Get the roll
Bye-bye
Search for the wild lights
The wild lights
Got a ticket cross the world with the first class fly
Ready for the home-run
All my mark clear the set ready, here it come, dumdum
Can it all be so simple
Can y'all explain
Is it just cause I'm black stayin' strapped in the game

Life is get your money whether is do or die
Come get your money, get honey and get real high
Struggle like a muthafucka sometimes you cry
Then you gone
Life is get your money whether is do or die
Get your money, get honey and get real high
Struggle like a muthafucka sometimes you cry
Then you gone
Yeah - ye-ye-ye-ye-ye, yeah, yeah then you gone (hey)
Yeah - ye-ye-ye-ye-ye, yeah, yeah then you gone (hey)
Ye-ye-ye-ye-ye, yeah, yeah c'mon
