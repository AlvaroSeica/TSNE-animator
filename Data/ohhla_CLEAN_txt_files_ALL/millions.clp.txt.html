[Intro: Pusha T]
YEAH! YEAH!
You know what happen when G.O.O.D. Music and MMG get together, right?
We get that money...

[Chorus 2X: Pusha T] 
Millions-millions in the ceiling, millions-millions in the ceiling
Millions-millions in the ceiling, millions-millions in the ceiling
Choppas-choppas in the closet, choppas-choppas in the closet
Choppas-choppas in the closet, choppas-choppas in the closet

[Pusha T]
This that shit that y'all wanted, this shit cook up hard, don't it?
Y'all gotta beg my pardon on it, but this shit sound like God don't it?
Yuugh, I'm tired, nigga and y'all gotta pay your tithes, nigga
Call my Phantom the holy ghost, church on chrome wheel tires, nigga
Pop tags when I'm paranoid cause the pawn shop was my paradise
I was dead pop when that powder came for that knot saved in that shoebox
Blue tops, blue tops, bad bitch in that blue fox
This big face is in blu-ray and these black diamonds like boondocks
I restore the feelin' of when niggas made a killin'
Hidin' choppas in the closet, half a million in the ceiling
And them hoes with angel faces, cryin' loud with ill intentions
Just so I can buy them Christians, have 'em shittin' on all they bitches, AH!

[Chorus] 

[Rick Ross]
WOOOOO.. HUH! {M-M-Maybach Music}
I'm haunted by horror stories (yeah), wanna-be home owners (yeah)
Horrible outcome, a dope boy got one motive (WOO!)
Cries when he convicted, cried on every visit
I'm cryin' sayin' his name, ride for all my niggas
Used to fiddle my finger, 'til I found me a fortune
Finger fuck a Ferrari, south of France early morning (AHH!)
Did drugs with Donatella, Versace my a cappella (HUH)
Never see me in Neiman's, niggas committin' treason (WHOO!)
Soft loafer preferred, frost, organic herb
Stay away from the Forbes, if I only could tell you more
I got this I got that, I got that I got this
Got a kilo for 20, my choppas say I'm the shit - RRRAH
{Maybach Music}

[Chorus] 

[Pusha T]
This that shit y'all ask for, make a nigga mash on the gas, floor
Two-door, four-door, roll through the hood like task force
Fast forward - OOPS! They say they wanna see proof
My record sales ain't much as theirs and we still ride the same coupes
How we still fuck the same hoes, why we still buy the same clothes
How we both got the same watch, I'm just keepin' y'all on y'all toes
Dope boys, gold mine, that price drop and that coke rise
Then set it over that blue flame then hang it dry like clothesline
I restore the feelin' of when niggas made a killin'
Hidin' choppas in the closet, half a million in the ceiling
Got the razor on the counter, Arm &amp; Hammer in the kitchen
Just to keep my feet in Christians and keep fuckin' all y'all bitches, AH!

[Chorus] 

[Outro 4X: Pusha T] 
This that shit that ya'll wanted...
...This shit sound like God don't it</pre>
