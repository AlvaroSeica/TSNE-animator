"The United States #1 ninja killer is called back into action"

I need you, I need you to come back and kill these ninjas
Only you can do it Blaine
  I told you, I don't kill no ninjas no mo'

"He's back, here we go again!"

[mc chris]
One, two, three, four - everyone
Everyone let's get to the center
Go to the center, go to the center
Okay, these are good, now take these~!
Rocko, Rocko you take these
Rocko you take these
Correct the road, you take these

"It's time for a family reunion this Christmas"

... Mom, are you telling me, you're a ninja?

[mc chris]
Leave one shoe on each seat
Take off your pants, take your shirt off
(Shave your beard and put your beard in another seat)

... I was hoping, we could have something in common

SHUT THE FUCK UP and just watch the seat
(Alright, alright, I want, I want Sour Patch)
These seats are more important than you are
{*loud explosion*} May the force be with you

"Mother's Day, it's Christmas!"

C'mon you guys, shhh, c'mon c'mon
