[Brook Yung]
Sometimes I look at the clouds and pray to the sky
Thankin the angels for life every day I'm alive
You say that I'm fly? Sort of like an angel disguised
My reply's "What type of angel am I?" A fine angel
My mind is an angle cradle hangin over my mind
Halo hangs over my eyes you ride but drive safe though
You, takin the L like right angles
A bottomless triangle's the life that lay over the side
I, see you smilin and lonely inside
You spit rhymes just to see the pandemonium rise
I only decide to rip when I'm controllin the beat
So the whole world know that it's me... B!

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
I stay rippin it the second I flow
Get in the zone then I let it be known - you already know
I gotta hit 'em with consecutive flows
I get it on, then I'm lettin it go - you already know

[Brook Yung]
Boom, clap, I do my dirt like a garden
With mo' cuts than a rug or a carpet
I bend flows that end most like the farthest
And ring bells like the doors on apartments
Plug, I need a deal or a bargain
Give me a chance or a shot like the bar gives
My flow fresher than a deoderant bar strip
Ladies say HAY like the grass that the barn gets
Okay~! I'm on point like a dart is
The same dart gettin thrown at a target
Another thrown at my bottom, gettin parked in
And I ain't leavin, I'm gettin my Rosa Parks in

[Chorus]</pre>
