Typed by: Tha Masta

[Chorus 4X: Hell Razah and sample]
"I'm gonna tell you baby"
Tell me what you got say
"We're gonna move away from here"
Yea, we gotta move away
We gotta move the black nation, gotta move away

[Intro: Hell Razah]
Enter our Sunz of Man-sion
Where there's Killah Priest, Prodigal Sunn
And Hell Razah, 60 Second Assassin
Zodiac Killah, Supreme Reality Productions
Sunz of Man, Sunz of Man

[Hell Razah]
My thoughts is deeper than unity, in all communities
We be the newest drug, thugs that be sheddin their own blood
Judge of your death day, I said the angel of justice was my sensai
Verbal samurai, wicked killas, assault like cocaine from Panama
Interview of black minds and white managers
Movin over United Snakes like Canada
On a map, my raps is liable to collapse, Manhattan
No longer we be attracted to wicked ways and actions
Believe in I, who's wise? Lyrics mesmurize
Hypnotize, the uncivilized from moonrise to sunrise, surprise
Those that survive, alive is the ones I guide
Words are advertised, tranquilized, opponents get victimized
I get energized, prepare, open up your ears
Hear this world premiere, keepin your brains for souveniers
Hangin devils like chandeliers, the black cavalier
With a horse that ran out a fear
Which slavemasters wanna volunteer, in my final frontier?
In these last days, shit switch, Illuminati's plantin microchips
And innocent infants, knowledge for the mind
Is like a clip for the nine, BOOP!

[Chorus 2X]

[Prodigal Sunn]
Through Godly common sense, I condense frustated anger
From the basement of my mind, advocate rhymes through the end of time
Mentally I meditate bars, try to explode
It'll redeem your soul, Sunz of Man lace the globe
In the journey to the rule of infinity
My masculinity shapes my chemistry and shields my identity
See the strength I contain, identical to chemicals
Puncture your temple causin static in your mental
Thoughts are eternal, ignite the pages in my journal
Infect the planet with seven criminals, eleven men
Movin through terminals, undetected like minerals
Invincible, subliminal, punchin holes through your physical
We connect like constellations, absorbin radiation
Termination to burn it all through recreation
Welcome to the jungle of sin
Where adrenaline pumps through the hearts of corrupted men
But I transcend, extend, blew in the wind
Abolish, the modest, in carbon and oxygen
Prodigal Sunn, knowI'msayin?
Terminatin all rap creation in '95, '96, '97, 98

[Chorus 4X]

[Outro: Hell Razah]
We on our way to Heaven (2X)
All wack rappers are now terminated
Ain't no more devils comin past the vicinity
Yea, as we come to teach the uncivilized (4X)
Open up your eyes
As we come to teach the uncivilized
Open up your eyes, realize
Yea, '95, we takin over, no more prayin to Jehovah
Word be bond, the Gods has arised
Yea, yea, true and livin</pre>
