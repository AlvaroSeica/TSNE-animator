Verse One: June Marx

The Animal within awaits, inside the graphical interface
Of the Animus, demanding that I innovate
Damaging the system trait, understand and plan against the hazardous
Before the last of us disintegrate
Capturing inner state,I gasp hyperventilate
Relive my ancestors bitter fate
The past I'm a infiltrate, grasp knowledge subdue misery,
Fools speak wickedly, doomed to repeat history
Usage of imagery,produce script vividly,
Travel back in time fill the tomb with calligraphy
Unravel the mind of June, confuse the industry,
Unparalleled design, consumed instantly
By the sacred core, i engage them all
The past and present opposing in the ancient war
I was mentioned, chosen and my language raw,
The last descendant of those who came before

Verse Two: Lone Ninja

Devious, sadistic since a previous existence
Grim reaper I'm the leader of the mystics 
Disguised sniper still assaulting the enemy
The live wire, feel the force of the energy	
View memory blocks of my ancestor
Too deadly to stop it's high adventure	
Lone devastates and full with vigor 
Wont hesitate to pull the trigger 	
The ghoulish figure the living plague
The cruelest victor with hidden blade	
Your vision fades to black, the twins
Will raid barracks, the mission wage attack
Laid the traps for the fighters and contras
I riot and romper, a frightening monster		
The viking will conquer, oppose contender
Reciting the mantra I wont surrender	</pre>
