[Shoestring - talking]
I'm ready to tell you my secret now
I see dead people, but they don't know that they're dead
And sometimes, when it get real cold, that means they're mad

[Shoestring - singing]
Can't go to sleep I hear a beat, it sounded just like feet
Jump off my seat, see they hit my window, cause I gots the beat
I've seen a shadow pulling cattle from an early battle
I've seen this snake up in my shoe and all I heard was rattle (rattle sound)
Picked up the phone and it exploded like a fucking bomb
I'm seeing shadows biting me like they was Jeffrey Dahm
So many clicks, so many crews trying to blow my fuse
So many shadows in my yard that I feel abused (gong sound)
I'm hearing voices in my head and I can see a tread
I'm seeing scores, a pitbull and he's smelling dead
Slipped on my slippers, the ones with the chromed zippers
Knocked out a shadow in my room, all these Jack the Rippers
I fight with tigers, the shadows say they're Michael Myers
Just like Jack Nickleson played "The Wolf" I hear my neighbors driers
All this pain in my brain makes me go insane
I'm hearing chains and tracks and running trains (train running, gong sound)
Alot of these soldiers in my kitchen with their bloody blades
No hands, no knives, just bodies and their hand grenades
I started ducking, them soldiers started busting at me
Flashbacks when I was two father hollered at me
Hearing whistles the click from pistols got me live annoyed
Past beef won't let me rest, I live like Sleepy Froyd
All these songs in my head and can't nobody tattle
Last night I killed two more, here comes another shadow (echos, gong sound)

[Bootleg - talking]
We're all walking in the valley of the shadow of death
So concentrate on your family, friends and loved ones
Because you never know when there's a shadow

[Chorus: Kalonda, Ryan]
Shadooooow, every time I turn around there's a shadooooow
Though I walk through the valley of a shadooooow (gong sound)
Life's too short to take for granted fearing shadooooow
I can't take this pain I'm feeling from these

[Bootleg]
Woke up, hopped out the bed this morning, felt somebody watching
Opened my door no one was there I swear I hear'em knocking
Cocking my pistol cause I'm paranoid and in a zone
Somebody said whip me, but I know I'm home alone (gong sound)
Jumped in the shower, trying to wash away this eary feeling
Walked out my bathroom seeing shadows dancing on the ceiling
Put on my clothes and smoked a cigarette and brushed my grill
My pitbull Puppy barking at so what I know ain't real (dogs barking)
Turned on my T.V. watching CNN, I heard a boom (explosion)
Two shadows having sex, I hear'em fucking in my room
Exit my residence the only face's a gust of wind (wind whistling)
Too hard for wind, a shadow's what it must have been
Ain't no such things as ghosts, I'm tripping dawg and I know it
Walked towards my car, the horn went off, a shadow had to blow it (car honks)
I need a drink to think and sort out all these weird events
I killed a man, my life's been haunted ever since
I can't believe the shit I'm seeing turning up my bottle
I keep my eyes and I'll rip you, I swear I'm being followed
Can't goto sleep at night unless I take a sleeping pill
Reflections in the mirror fucking with my head for real (gong sound)
I never thought that there was nothing wrong with how I think
Until my momma told me: 'Leg, go see a shrink!
All these songs in my head and can't nobody tattle
Last night I killed two more, here comes another shadow

[Chorus]

[Bootleg - talking]
I thank God every morning when I wake up
Cause you never know when you're gonna walk out your front door
And get murdered in your driveway
So I'll be telling you this: Keep your mind on your family, friends, and foes
Cause most niggas is hoes (gong sound)
And they shoot you cause you bawling more than they is
So stay out them whole in the Warclubs
Nigga show love to your family and friends
And get your ass, fuck'em

[Ryan]
