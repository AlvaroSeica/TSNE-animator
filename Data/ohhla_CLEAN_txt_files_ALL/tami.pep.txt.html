(Pep Love)
My women, to all my black women
T-A-M-I, huh

Dear T.A.M.I., my heart bleeds for you
Words on a page, my calm and my rage
Beauty that's undescribed, we coincide in one vibe
Given the rhythm that makes me come alive
And I, been thinkin about this for awhile
When I mention my love for you, feelin like a child inside
Fortified by the image of your face
See she's the one that sat a nigga down and laced me
I remember you, as a little girl
Daddy was gone, had never been in your world
Mother was strugglin, three jobs jugglin
You seemed oblivious, like it wasn't nothin
T.A.M.I. shine with the brilliance
Bounce with resilience
Work with the cards that you dealt with
Life was hard, and I was too young to see
You had a crush on me, that was dumb to me
I just wanted to run the streets
Holla at the ho's, drink fo' oh's
But when I take a moment and think
I sink into the ink and begin imaginin
Her strength and how it's makin me weak
I never thought I would've thought it was me
But when I, close my eyes and get a vision of love
She's all that I see
Ghetto diamond, free from confinement
Sparks in my mind lit flames in my heart, the part that is

Chorus (2x)
T.A.M.I., the only one that understand me
(All for you, it's really all for you)
Days and nights I count away, she remind me
(All for you, it's really all for you)
Of dreams and things my inspiration brings into a world so crazy
(All for you, it's really all for you)

I look in your eyes and see a woman risin
All the guys been, tryin ta get between ya thighs
And true lies they tell, what your innocence hides
They never would've never guessed, you were so wise
I feel blessed to be able to see the part of you that's more special
I remember the stress, you passed the test
Plus you never needed to fuss through the strife and toil
You taught me how to keep my head high, now my life is yours
And I apologize for the things I did to cause you pain
I SPEAK not these words in vain, my days and nights
Are spent tryin ta put my name in lights
Convinced mommy raised me right
It only makes sense that you would be the one for me
I know you been with others but you savin some for me
You ain't mine, I would never try to contain you
Let you shine, and with this I put it all on the line
I find that it's

Chorus

At night we take flight
On into the morning to the day's first light
We blaze the purple haze, count the ways
The world rotates and stays crazy
But never faze me, we travel the maze
Gaze at the stars, lust and expensive cars
Material dreams, results of extensive scars
Nobody, knows but you when the doors are closed
My wars unfold, and few these stories told

Chorus (2x)

Dear T.A.M.I., my heart bleeds for you
Words on a page, my calm and my rage
Beauty that's undescribed, we coincide in one vibe
Given the rhythm that makes me come alive
And I, been thinkin about this for awhile
When I mention my love for you, feelin like a child inside
Fortified by the image of your face
See she's the one that sat a nigga down and laced me
I remember you, as a little girl
Daddy was gone, had never been in your world
Mother was strugglin, three jobs jugglin
You seemed oblivious, like it wasn't nothin
T.A.M.I. shine with the brilliance
Bounce with resilience
Work with the cards that you dealt with
Life was hard, and I was too young to see
You had a crush on me, that was dumb to me
I just wanted to run the streets
Holla at the ho's, drink fo' oh's
But when I take a moment and think
I sink into the ink and begin imaginin
Her strength and how it's makin me weak
I never thought I would've thought it was me
But when I, shut my eyes and get a vision of love
She's all that I see
Ghetto diamond, free from confinement
Sparks in my mind lit flames in my heart, the part that is
