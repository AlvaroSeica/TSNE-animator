[Andy Cooper]
Here we go!

[Chorus]
SHOOT YOUR SHOT!
Man, I wanna know WHAT YOU GOT!
Load it up and HIT THAT SPOT!
Grab the mic and SHOOT YOUR SHOT!

[Andy Cooper]
Thes One!

[Thes One]
Hey yo, P-U-T-S and U-D, you be truly blessed
Rap panelist, Thes handle this like an analyst
(YES!) yes y'all the Einstein rhythm and rhyme
Combines like red wine and Tylenol
(OOOOH!) Shit, the grown relaxing in the field
But don't sleep, P count green, not sheep
With K. Jax, he rolls up the weed like haystacks
To bath tub down on you scrubs like Ajax
You're too fruity to rip the rooty tooty with your loofah
New booty ladies too lazy to raise the roof up
The plug desenchufa, could the crew get any doper
Man, we own this, live under the stairs like Mr. Roper
Home of the (NEW) generation, we got the torch
Let me call into U-D Dustin to bust 'em off
Blown Celeb and resurrecting the dead with three day block
Posse cut resurrection instead, so pass the ROCK!

[Dizzy Dustin]
I'm about to pop the clip in as I stop the opposition
You gotta cop a listen when I'm knockin like a piston
I spit arsenic so I'm hard to miss
You're in a DAZE cause I BLAZE like an arsonist
I come up in the house like a thief in the night
And electrify a crowd like keys on a kite
(STAY CALM!) Before I drop the napalm
Find yourself caught in a dangerous liaison
Lay it on thick, brick by brick, lickety split
Rhymes are fat like Jiminy Glick
You want beef, here's a hickory stick, I shoot the gift
You won't know it till it's over like a mystery flick
To put it blunt, I pack a punch like a school lunch
Got no time for punks, they take lumps
So PLEASE stop bugging for my honeycombs
or I'll hit you in the funny bone (OWW!!)

[Chorus]
SHOOT YOUR SHOT!
Man, I wanna know WHAT YOU GOT!
Load it up and HIT THAT SPOT!
Grab the mic and SHOOT YOUR SHOT!
Come on, you gotta SHOOT YOUR SHOT! (Yeah, yeah)
We wanna know WHAT YOU GOT! (Yeah, yeah)
Load it up and HIT THAT SPOT! (Yeah, yeah)
Grab your mic and SHOOT YOUR SHOT!

[Andy Cooper]
I will!
Andy's the name, takin aim like Calamity Jane
In a rap's last stand I'm the man who remains
When I claim to pack heat (uh-huh), know my ammunition
Is my flow and rhythm SO I'm armed to the teeth
My lungs are gun powder, throat cold and narrow
So when I open my mouth you're looking down the barrel
Of an emcee sniper, eye in the scope
Reigning down rounds of rhyme, fire, and smoke (BOOM!)
Lighting strikes twice from my mic device
Cause when I write it's like guns in knife fights
There's no competition so I don't listen
You think you're dope here's a penny, go wishin
I shoot to kill, better know the odds
Or wind up on boot hill, man get out of dodge
(U-D!) plus Thes One and Double K
We all just laugh when your record is played

[Double K]
Ain't nothing funny, what y'all laughin at?
Yeah, it's K. Jackson over here with my homeboy
You know what I'm saying
I'm just helpin 'em out on this microphone

It goes hippa to the hoppa and it just don't stoppa
I'm dressed in all black with my man K. Jax
I got thrown in the slammer, I tried to battle Hammer
They wanna interview me so I spit in the camera
You know I love Pac, that's why I got SHOT
Had to gain some credibility, now everybody feelin me
I'm on VH-ONE and MTV
I'm down with DJ EZ Rock and I'm back with U-D
It takes one to roll the blunt, it takes two to get jumped
And I be hanging at the church house looking for sluts
I hate rap music but, see, I'm so damn good
My homey told me "Boy, get it like I know that you could"
So I stole the microphone, wrote rhymes on my own
When I go to Burger King all the chicks are on my bone
It grows and grows and grows, gets a little bigger
You wanna see me skeet, baby girl, pull the trigger
I've got bang for your butt and I hate posse cuts
I'm a one mic thriller, I'm a soft beverage chiller
Whoever takes the mic, you better be illa
Now what's the time, everybody say (MILLER!!!!)

[Chorus]
SHOOT YOUR SHOT!
Man, I wanna know WHAT YOU GOT!
Load it up and HIT THAT SPOT!
Grab the mic and SHOOT YOUR SHOT!
Once again, you gotta SHOOT YOUR SHOT! (Yeah, yeah)
I wanna know WHAT YOU GOT! (Yeah, yeah)
Load it up and HIT THAT SPOT! (Yeah, yeah)
Get on the cut and SHOOT YOUR SHOT!

[Andy Cooper]
Einstein!
