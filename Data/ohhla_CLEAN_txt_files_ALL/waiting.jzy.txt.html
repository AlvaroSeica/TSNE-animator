[Chorus: Young Jeezy]
You know the world is waitin (waitin) 
Waitin on 103, they waitin, they waitin, they waitin 
They waitin, they waitin, they waitin, they waitin
We need some motivation ('vation)
So won't you come motivate me?
They waitin, they waitin, they waitin
They waitin, they waitin, they waitin, they waitin
I done told y'all and told y'all and told y'all again
Play the game, play the game, play the game, yeah to win
I ain't lose, I don't lose, I ain't lose, never lost
Always on, keepin on, always on, never off (Let's go!)

[Young Jeezy]
What the fuck is you hatin fo' like you done something for a nigga
Would call you out, but that wouldn't do shit fo' a nigga (Ha-haaaaah!)
I made it this far, a fool with my foolish pride
Look at me, what you see? A fool in his foolish ride (Yeaaaaaaaaah!)
Y'all know damn well I wahn't lettin you niggaz down
Just to sit back and watch you led by these fuckin clowns (Woo!)
Fo' albums in, niggaz still talkin this real shit
Three classics in nigga, and that's on some real shit (Ha-haaaaah!)
Bitch I'm legendary ('dary), bitch I'm a livin legend (legend)
Been through straight hell so I can get street heaven (Young~!)
Bitch I'm Jeezy, the one you been waitin fo'
And them Forgies is off-set, don't they look like they skatin hoe?

[Chorus]

[Young Jeezy]
Bitch I was born high (high), and that's how I'm dyin nigga (nigga)
Eyes wide shut with my finger on the cold trigger (Bow!)
You be hearin my word, now don't it sound like my soul bleedin?
Hearin my word, now don't it sound like my soul readin? (Let's GO!)
I do it for street niggaz and every nigga that's like you (you)
Let's see if you can afford one, even niggaz that buy two (Whoo!)
Cain't believe what I'm hearin, cain't believe whatcha sayin
All that I did, Goddamn, this how you try to play 'em (Daaaaaaamn!)
Feelin my words when I be talkin that street talk
No, you be feelin my words when I be talking that street smart (smart)
Yeah, School of Hard Knocks, yeah bitch I graduated
Straight to them hard blocks and nothing was fabricated
