[Verse 1]
I lock stock in one smoking tongue
Punch lines break your ribs, follow through to puncture lungs
The chosen one, infidel so I rebel
Got his beats locked down in an H-Block cell
They kill at random, accused of being crazy
Give whiplash to slip mats while flirting with ladies
There's no maybes, just make up your mind
The masterpiece will never cease, it's the perfect time
Divine way of thought, break the law
Walk from shadow to shadow, we'll never get caught
You know the sort, I need to fuck up the system
Paralysed by the rhythm, make you sit back and listen
This ain't wisdom, it's just a madman on the loose
Getting more heated than a body builder on the juice
Here's a noose to put to use, the truth is deadly
You won't get far like having no wheels on a treadly
So don't tempt me or feel the wrath of Drapht
The aftermath you left shattered like shards of glass
Fuck the past, I'm living in today
Can see right through the fake like an x-ray
Never obey, living in a giant's world
Crushing anything in my path, never let my head swell
So when exactly were you gonna sell?
Ninety percent of your listeners are nine to ten-year-old girls

[Verse 2]
Follow no footsteps, make my own path
I'm blinded by temptation, guided by stars
On charge, the target large to massive
From bar brawls to road rage with cars in traffic
Light that matchstick, feed my fuel
Sweat drips off my nose, I can't keep my cool
So I'm stranded, with an upper hand I have landed
Above standard, your total attention is demanded
Gotta abandon any dead weight
I'm dead straight to break through before it's too late
Keep faith like Dash, I will never stop
Shape shifting from the matrix to a telephone box
Block your move, the draw card is destined
The Sundance Kid in this Syllabolic western
Ask the question, is there long term effects?
The answer's yes, you're left with a dislocated neck

[Verse 3]
To end it off, it's a brand new era
Got no position or power in this war against terror
Learn to live in the shadows of our ministers
One man fucks up and it affects all the innocent
Select the finisher, just wipe the slate
I wasn't told we lived just for the United States
Now it's too late, the ball begins to roll
You sold your soul not even for the green and gold
Told I can't grow old, place the time limit
To live out my dreams, counting down the dying minutes
One thing that stuns me living in this country
Howard says about as many intelligent things as Humphrey
Try and hunt me, I can't be stopped
Exist in the back of your head next to the pile of rocks
Tick tock, your time's up, lights out
Drapht the head-hunter, you better duck and move south
Me and my big mouth manage to vanish
When anyone starts to talk about paying for the damage
It's a dynamic force, torture towns
Shake up your balance, leave worlds upside down
I astound in a pronoun perspective
Drapht, S-B-X, kid it's getting fuckin hectic
So call the medic, mankind's been hit
Much too weak to retaliate, just sit and get a grip
