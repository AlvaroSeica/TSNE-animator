[Timbaland]
Uhh, I get over heels for someone
I, that I really can't deal with (deal with)
I want to block her out my mind
But I really can't do it (do it)
I tell myself this the last time
I'ma let her do this to me
Whenever we do... spend time
I realize that I can't get enough of you

[Interlude: Patrick Stump from Fall Out Boy] + (Timbaland)
Wipe that sm-ile off your fuckin face (and I say to you)
Wipe that sm-ile off your face (then I say to you)
Wipe that sm-ile off your fuckin face (and I say to you)
Wipe that sm-ile off your faaaaace

[Chorus: Patrick Stump]
To be despised, to be loved
To be dreamt of, to be sought
I'm the inside of I don't care
Right in the middle, I'm right in the middle
To be despised, to be loved
To be dreamt of, to be sought
I'm the inside of I don't care
Right in the middle, I'm right in the middle
Be my unholy, my one and my lone-lyyyyy

[Patrick Stump]
I wear scarves and hoods
cause they're the only poker face that I've got left
And everything I love about you is a mess
Smash the mirror and break the palm reader's hand
I want to be better than I am

[Interlude]

[Chorus]

[Timbaland]
AOWWWWWW! Girl, just look what you've done
How could you do this to me?
I gotta put my foot down
I can't let you do this to me
I can't forget those good ol' times
And all the things you've been doin to me
I wanna hit that one mo' time
I'm in love, what'chu doin to me
I'ma say it loud
Right here let's fuck in this crowd
Why we arguin
I thought me and you were 'posed to be, friends
Let's chill for minute (for a minute)
Better yet we need to heal for a minute (for a minute)
Baby, put down the knife
Sometimes I wanna save ya life
But I'm in..

[Chorus]

[Outro]
We don't got no fuckin band~!
We ain't got no speakers, no fuckin microphones set up
Timberland, you tunin son of a bitch
Get the fuck outta my house now
'Fore I get too mad and I can't turn back
HEY!! Didn't I say get the fuck out!
Get the fuck out! Ha ha ha ha ha...</pre>
