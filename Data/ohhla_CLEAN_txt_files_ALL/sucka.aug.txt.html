[August]
Why you callin my whole problems, them your problems... [dial tone]
Then you callin back nigga fuck that call your chick this my phone
Last time I checked I was full grown
So I ain't got time to play withcha
Keep on talking that bullshit
I might make your girl a twit picture
Pose, yeah
Your chick will be lovin that
My spot be the place she get her lovin at (loving at)
Don't be mad 'cause I didn't know she was your girl then
Now you sad sayin that August stole your girlfriend

[Chorus]
Love is for suckers that's why I don't trust em
'Cause you tryin cuff em
You end up in trouble sayin
Love is for suckers that's why I don't need it
'Cause when she say she love you
She'll make you believe that you're in love
(Love, love love, love love)
Now she got you open and she got you hopin you're in love
(Love love love, love love)
But you shouldn't trust her 'cause you just a sucka for love
(Oh oh ohhh you),
You're not in love, you're just a sucka for love
Uh uh uh, you're not in love, you're just a sucka for love

[Lloyd]
What's up homie? What's goin on? I heard you gotta lame nigga calling your phone
He got this game all wrong, if he had any words witcha
He's a fool to be calling you, guess he don't see the big picture (LOVE!)
That four letter word will have you sick, and love will have a nigga losing it
Cause he thought he could trust her and she ain't like the others so he thought he could love her
But now he's saying...

[Chorus]
Love is for suckers that's why I don't trust em
'Cause you tryin cuff em
You end up in trouble sayin
Love is for suckers that's why I don't need it
'Cause when she say she love you
She'll make you believe that you're in love
(Love, love love, love love)
Now she got you open and she got you hopin you're in love
(Love love love, love love)
But you shouldn't trust her 'cause you just a sucka for love
(Oh oh ohhh you),
You're not in love, you're just a sucka for love
Uh uh uh, you're not in love, you're just a sucka for love...

(Just a sucka, just a sucka)
(Just a sucka, just a sucka)
(Just a sucka, just a sucka)
You're not in love, you're just a sucka
