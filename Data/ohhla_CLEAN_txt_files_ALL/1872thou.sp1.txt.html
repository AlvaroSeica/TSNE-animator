(Intro: Spice 1)
(*Drink something, smoke something - repeated in background*)
Ay Spi, ay, ay nigga, what happened to that um
that old, old, that old school shit you used to kick?
(What old school shit?) You know that old school shit nigga that er...
that 187 Proof shit nigga, come over here and spit some of that shit
(Aight, aight hold on, aight, hold on)

(Spice 1) 
Coolin' on the corner with the cellular phone 
now you can tell that the East Bay was his home 
More mail than the rest of the pushers 
cause hes got a Tech-Nine in the bushes 
And thats how the shit was handled, first name Jack, last name Daniels 
Had two boys named E and J, E had the Nine and J the AK 
Clocked on a street called Henessey 
robbers with a motherfucker named O.E. 
E had a bitch and her name was Gin 
who had a nigga named Juice doin' time in the pen
You couldnt tell that Gin was a bitch though 
cause she was fuckin' some nigga named Cisco
E and J knew tonight theyd come 
with two fat niggas named Bacardi and Rum 
The cap jacks hoe and the sight was scary 
the bitch was all bloody and her name was Mary 
Officer Martini wiped up the body 
and all fingers pointed at Rum and Bacardi 
E and J told Jack the hotel, so Jack tried to bail Juice out the jail 
But ol E had the judge on the payroll clout 
so Jack shot the judge up and broke Juice out 
And everybodys talkin' 'bout Gin and Juice
Juice shot Gin cause the bitch was loose 
Now E is shook thinkin' they aint gonna get me 
Ill round up the posse and call up Mickey 
Mickey was big, he only sold eight balls 
had ninety-nine niggas up against the wall 
E and J found out he made the call 
so E and J and Jack and Juice nined them all 
They were sent to the morgue and Mickey paid the bill 
got the money from his bitch reckless Strawberry Hill
Jack and Juice said Mickey wouldnt survive 
but Mickey he was slick he had a Colt .45 
And now hes wonderin' how he got the word 
it was the neighborhood wino Thunderbird 
You wonder how the murder rap got so much juice 
it was a hundred and eighty-seven proof, check it out (*echoes*)

(Chorus)
Drink somethin', smoke somethin', drink somethin', smoke somethin', ROLL IT UP!!
Drink somethin', smoke somethin', drink somethin', smoke somethin', SMOKE IT UP!!
Drink somethin', smoke somethin', drink somethin', smoke somethin', ROLL IT UP!!
Drink somethin', smoke somethin', smoke somethin' smoke somethin', DRINK IT UP!!

Mickey sent St. Ides after Thunderbird 
time for the Hurricane E said word 
Thunderbird in an alley waitin' wearin' a beaniy
Tryin' to get away from the cop Mr. Martini
St. Ides screwed off Thunderbirds top 
spilled his drink and gave a swig to the cop 
But its too late Martini knows it all 
Mickey and his boy OD were slangin' eight balls
of crystal to the strawberries on the hill
so when he asked for Juice he got a quick fill 
Mickey had his boy on Bourbon Blocks 
the murderous cop killer Mr. Pimp and Miss Schnapps 
Mickey had this thing about nosey cops
and it made Mr Peppermint lose his top 
Martini off duty waitin' for the Night Train
didnt know his wife Champaign would never see him again 
Peppermint Schnapps creepin' with the Colt .45
gotta peel his cap before the train arrives 
Gotta stay low in Broward here comes the train 
all the boys said the engineers is Bartles and James
There was a toot from the train and then a gun blast 
Martini fell on the ground there was a big splash 
Mr Schnapps got up because the cops chased him 
St. Ides and Mickey in a 'Vette in front of the station
But you know Jack and Juice was undercover 
Jack was mad because Mickey shot his lover
there was big shootout and Mickey got juiced 
he couldnt hang with the 1-8-7-the-proof
They all splattered and St. Ides had took a fall
and then Endo smoked 'em all, check it out (*echoes*)

(Chorus)
Drink somethin', smoke somethin', drink somethin', smoke somethin', SMOKE IT UP!!
Drink somethin', smoke somethin', drink somethin', drink somethin', DRINK IT UP!!
Drink somethin', smoke somethin', drink somethin', smoke somethin', SMOKE IT UP!!
Drink somethin', drink somethin', smoke somethin', smoke somethin', SMOKE IT UP!!</pre>
