[repeat 2X]
You can catch me on the West Wing
Catch me on the West Wing
Guitars from the West Wing
Guitars from the West Wing

[Wafeek]
I'm gone on a power trip, nah it's all politics
And I'm the President, so, this is not a diss
I'm acknowledgin those who won't pay the 'tician
On the team that's run by me
I want my ring, I came on a mission
Spend some trap from the hills, that freak is whack
We fight amongst ourselves while they get big as crap
But blue skies prevail, and when the rain come
We both get wet
I'm changin the game, listen

Y'all wanna talk shit, we heard about it
Y'all wanna start shit, we ain't worried 'bout ya
Y'all wanna talk shit, we'll let 'em know
Y'all wanna start shit, we gon' let it go</pre>
