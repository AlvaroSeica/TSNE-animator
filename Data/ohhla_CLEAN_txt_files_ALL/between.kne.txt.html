(Kane &amp; Abel talking)
Sometimes, these buster ass niggas fall in love with these
trick ass hoes
You know what I'm saying, they forget about their homeboys
Stop falling in love with these tricks, let friendships go 
to waste you know what I'm saying

Verse 1 (Kane) 

Used to be my nigga now some buster I don't even know
You ran up like some bitch pussy whipped by some dog hoe 
And I'm a poor stupid nigga you had to gaul
In love with this bitch who suck more cock than Rupaul
You fake ass niggas do fake ass shit
And fake ass niggas get pussy whipped
It ain't the bitch its the principle of it, nigga fuck it
We can handle this like gentlemans or get into some thug shit
She loved it, yo can't you see your bitch chose me
Nigga now you got the jealousy fucking up the currency
Its killing me so much that now I'm contemplating murder
can't you tell
I hope they got a hoe for you in hell

Chorus

You used to be my best friend 
than you let a bitch come between us
(Yo bitch got between us)
You used to be my row dog 
than you let a bitch come between us
(You know I take a bullet for you now you gone fuck it up)

Verse 2 (Abel)

My ex nigga its a shame best to leave that hoe alone
Let her game get in your fucking veins like heroin
I remember when you met her city lights, club hopping
Caught your eye doing that butterfly that hoe was pussy popping
You was hugging on her, loving on her, tried to tell you then
Better leave that freak alone she only out for your ends
You started tripping, tricking off that hoe outfits
DKNY, polo socks with them white reeboks
Two weeks later, she gave me her number that was it
Fucked that hoe like a gorilla, tried to kill her that dog bitch
And so, I'm hearing that you calling me a hoe
To this dirty little trick that you didn't know a month ago
I'll show you whose a hoe, ghetto, get the 44
Let this nigga know, let this nigga know
I met the pullbearer so them niggaz call me drama
I'm upset, get the black dress for your mama

Chorus

Verse 3 (Kane)

We used to go to school together, shoot pool together
Now I wanna shoot your ass and end your life forever
Nigga keep on letting that bitch playa hate
And that he say she say will get a tech up in your face
Shut the fuck up nigga what, pass that fucking swisher
Never sweat a bitch never let a bitch kiss ya
Alright lets stop it squash it, no need to pull the trigger
For we be shot hunched over, she bending over with the next nigga
Its cool, I put away your concrete shoes
Cause I got some love left, but you was close to death
I seen it coming but got damn it was still kinda funny
How that hoe got between us like Nino and G Money
Cause fake ass niggas do fake ass shit
And fake ass niggas get pussy whipped
Fake ass niggas do fake ass shit
And fake ass niggas get pistol whipped
