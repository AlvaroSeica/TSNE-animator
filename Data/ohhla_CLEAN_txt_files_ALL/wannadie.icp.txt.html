Typed by: psychopathic_from_outter_space@hotmail.com

"They want me dead in Detroit...
 they want me dead in St. Louis...
 they want me dead up in Denver...
 New York, L.A., they want me dead...
 they want me dead on the east coast...
 down south they want me dead...
 they want me dead in the Bahamas...
 they want me dead in Lebanon check it"

Wait a minute, ho'd up
Don't shut my fuckin coffin yet, I'm still alive
And fulla life, like a beehive
I know you really want to see me drop into the earth
You wanted that since my birth, but ho'd up partna'
I got to many poker chips, still gotta cash 'em in
I still be lovin Friday nights I'm flossin, ryda fashion
And mashin, in a black Navigator baby
100 spoke Dayton Dayday today be payday
This hoe was lookin like she wanna fyda dick up in her
And i'm the beginner, winner, we fuckin during dinner
To bang her biscuit out our first time out is nothin new
I fuck her on the plate of food
I'ma rude, crude, dude
Most players like to take they women wine'n dinin
I serve a bitch a plate of dick, a bowl of nuts that's it
I gotta lot on this earth to live for and I don't wanna die, fuck that
I'm tryin' a touch the sky

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Reach into the world, reach into the sky
I'ma Psychopathic Ryder and I don't wanna die

I'm hittin switches in a black Escalade truck
I know you must be thinkin' "what the fuck?" but I can
I'm like Bump, Bump, squeek, Bump, Bump, swing dip
Bump, Bump, swing dip, it's a trip
$16,000 dollar rolex, I flex
I'm boatin' an Impala, hood is open and i'm scopin
Bitches flaggin' me down, wit' they tittie nipples
But see it aint that simple, bitches now'll leave you crippled
If I stuck my dick in every ugly bitch that road up
My dick would make you wanna throw up, I would be so to 'up
And I don't wanna have my dick look like a cucumber
Bumply, green and lumber, fuck all that
I gets picky, I like to take and floss my hoes
I can't be flossin dirty bitches that got mossy toes
It's a million hottie hootchies all up on this earth
Taste what life is worth man, I don't wanna die

[Chorus]

You can bash out all my front teeth if you really want to
been wantin' to go part my grill out anyway so fuck you
I wanna live to see the world rain diamonds and pearls
And treasures, for all the little boys and girls
I want to live to see my great grandchildren have they kids
and be so old that I can't even lift my eyelids
I want to live to see the lights of the Goodyear blimp
It's gone Ice Cube's a bitch
Psychopathic ryder baby, call me Bullet, I be dumpin
I get your brakes a pumpin everytime I'm droppin somethin
And I went solo so you know I flow like Rollie Pollie's
Roll up in they shill, bankin helly mill
So fuck Melly Mel, Master Flash and goofy Kool Moe Dee
And every other bitch that fell off back in '83
Y'all didn't influence the rydas, we dumpin bullets in the sky
We aint never gone die baby

[Chorus]

"Full Clip...aint never gone die
 Cell Block...aint never gone die, 
 Twin Gats...aint never gone die, 
 Foe Foe...aint never gone die, 
 Lil' Shank...aint never gone die, 
 My homie Alex...aint never gone die, 
 Jump Steady...aint never gone die"</pre>
