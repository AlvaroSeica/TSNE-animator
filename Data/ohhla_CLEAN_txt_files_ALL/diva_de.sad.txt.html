[Intro]
Who knows where the road may lead us
Who knows if we'll meet along

[Sadistik]
I whispered in her ear just to glare inside the fences
Her ambrosia could paralyze the senses
A paradigm, to hear the acid rain
Of paradise she dreamt with the tears she can't contain
And one by one, they poured in incrementally
She took my crown of thorns and she wore it as a wedding ring
Said "I do," reciprocated vows
And blew a thousand kisses to the dissipated clouds
I held her claws as we walked between the headstones
Of those who tried connecting all the dots between her freckles
Then she let go... and so did I
as I studied hieroglyphics on her alabaster pigment
All her thoughts would compose a careful symphony
that summoned all my scars and the ghost of serendipity
They sang a hymn though that could cloak the air in mystery
to shatter all my shields, to expose a flair of misery
On a day like this, I'ma break my wrist
when I write a little bit about the strangest kiss
that would grace my lips, and the frozen tongue
that was soaked in blood but it tasted bliss
I start to choke, break in half 'cause I can hear the battle sounds
Of gods that close their stake in hand to fight vampiric habits now
You think I'm sentimental? I think you're heavy mental
with some innocent intents too intense cause you said "be gentle"
And this is more or less a morbid test of sordid stress
A foreign sense of orchid scents before I lay my skull to rest
I sit alone and think of darkness while the sun is raised
You grip that throne to drink from hearts until their blood is drained
But at least you're honest, speaking like you're being modest
'til you see a carcass at your feet and then you feast upon it
Your eyes resemble Mephistopheles, in fact
I've never seen you smile at all and all your teeth are black
The Diva de los Muertos is just swallowing my skin
When she sneaks in with her scarecrows and it's haunting me again
When she...

[Interlude]
I'm not gonna, tiptoe around your, marriage or
whatever it is you got going there
Do you wanna be with me? Be with me (okay)
Too many guys don't get the concept, or
I complete them, or
I make them alive
I'm just a fucked up girl who's looking for a decent mind
Don't assign me yours

[Sadistik]
I always knew you were pretty with all those scratches on your face
Look...

And while I'm all apologetic you just conjure monsters headed
to my head, it's probable, the claws are sharpened, sharp and ready
Steady when you're treading, careful not to fall in love
Cause when I'm finally done you'll know why it's called a crush
All your bones corroded and they hide inside decaying flesh
Still you cut your tongue out cause you don't want to taste it yet
So save your breath, you kiss me like a guillotine
fuck just like a whore and smell like whiskey and some Listerine
Follow me again and sing and howl with the wind
And when I travel to the gallows you just scowl me again
And grin with foul teeth and skin, when you go to bury daisies
Haunted by carriages, +Rosemary's Baby+
Listen gravedancer, with disarray pander
Your lips display cancer and kissed my face after
Come and go to summon hope with cryptic fake glamour
But under oath you cut my throat with sickle blade laughter
And it's hard to keep your sanity when spirits'll consume you
and you're consuming spirits just to peer into the voodoo
Who knew, that you could smile when you take a life?
Surviving from the vitamins you're finding when you take a bite
All my questions all are meshes, wallowed sections
Of my chest, the small intestines, large intestines
all a plexus, all digested
Not to mention, you're just following a trend
When the Diva de los Muertos is just haunting me again
(Just is haunting me again...)</pre>
