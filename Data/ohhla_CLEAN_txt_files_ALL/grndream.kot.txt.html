Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Green dreams they fill my mind
Green dreams my favorite kind
Green dreams a mile high
If you come down, then have another green dream
Things don't stay the same, (in my mind look inside)
Everything's bound to change, (put me high now we fly)
Like clouds run through the sky, (It's you and I till we die)
We stay a mile high
Things don't stay the same, (in my mind look inside)
Everything's bound to change, (put me high now we fly)
Like clouds run through the sky, (It's you and I till we die)
We stay a mile high
This crowd never back down
My clown you can not drown
Come pie, I will not die
Tell 'em I coming, tell 'em I'm prime
Tell em all about rat top shop with a man inside, he really ain't fine
Keep alotta of my thumb, keep alotta water to the pot a vine
We are not over the cause, we are not over the fight, we are not over the populous
We will continue to fly, fuck em for dicking my green dreams, fuck em for giving my high
Spin up another and tell the reason I gave em my weed is a lifeflood
I am in love with the herb burning up only the nice bud
Stay up in the quadroon where dogs run off there leashes
So I guess you can call this my thesis
Smoking on the same strings probably as Jesus
Cause the herbs from the earth are how I pledge my allegiance
Feel my green dreams as this they all say
Fuck real life bet you roam every minute
So it keeps changing this thing we call life
So I keep smoking just to get high or just to get by
Green dreams they fill my mind
Green dreams my favorite kind
Green dreams a mile high
If you come down, then have another green dream
Things don't stay the same, (in my mind look inside)
Everything's bound to change, (put me high now we fly)
Like clouds run through the sky, (It's you and I till we die)
We stay a mile High
Things don't stay the same, (in my mind look inside)
Everything's bound to change, (put me high now we fly)
Like clouds run through the sky, (It's you and I till we die)
We stay a mile high
Getting chilly with this filling, counting my ends
I got enemies and foes but I got plenty more friends
When they say your time is up for me, it really begins
I got 99 problems so I'm dealing with 10
You say never say never so I never give up
When my glass is half empty I say fill up my cup
To the tip tip top I'm running over with love
I'm only burning high octane premium buzz
You Know I got the goods you know I float high
You know I toke the bomb every day and every night
You know I like the smell
You know it never fail
Either put your clothes in the air and fuck the hell
Ya you know the deal, this lonely life is chill
Always going out like trucks we climbing the hills
Smoking on the green tree
Smoking on the fruity
Packing up the poopy never slack and I got pretty
Green dreams they fill my mind
Green dreams my favorite kind
Green dreams a mile high
If you come down, then have another green dream
Things don't stay the same, (in my mind look inside)
Everything's bound to change, (put me high now we fly)
Like clouds run through the sky, (It's you and I till we die)
We stay a mile High
Things don't stay the same, (in my mind look inside)
Everything's bound to change, (put me high now we fly)
Like clouds run through the sky, (It's you and I till we die)
We stay a mile high
Green dreams they fill my mind
Green dreams my favorite kind
Green dreams a mile high
If you come down, then have another green dream
Green dreams they fill my mind
Green dreams my favorite kind
Green dreams a mile high
If you come down, then have another green dream
Green dreams they fill my mind
Green dreams my favorite kind
Green dreams a mile high
If you come down, then have another green dream
Things don't stay the same, (in my mind look inside)
Everything's bound to change, (put me high now we fly)
Like clouds run through the sky, (It's you and I till we die)
We stay a mile high
Things don't stay the same, (in my mind look inside)
Everything's bound to change, (put me high now we fly)
Like clouds run through the sky, (It's you and I till we die)
We stay a mile high</pre>
