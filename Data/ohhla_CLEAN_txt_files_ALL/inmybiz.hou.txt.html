[Missy]
Hey, this is Whitney and Missy, y'all
Ninety-nine, uh
Hey Missy, can ya believe this girl?
Misdemeanor, Missy Misdemeanor, uh
Ya heard?

[Whitney]
Hey baby, I get so many people
Telling me they seen you up in the mall
Are they mistaken?
All up on some chick as though
I don't exist, what is this, oh

1 - 	Why they all in our business
	It's just too ridiculous
	I can't get no sleep
	They just keep warning me
	Should I believe them
	They say I don't need it
	Don't they know I make up my mind, my mind

Haunting me
Too many people say you're fakin' me
They ask what have you done lately
They say we won't last
They're predicting that it's over, it's over

[Missy]
Too many girls that dislike me
Since I got you they wanna fight me
Cuz I'm the chick walking 'round with the ring
Tell me why these ho's, they don't even like me

Too many girls that dislike me
Since I got you they wanna fight me
Cuz I'm the chick walking 'round with the ring
Tell me why these ho's, they don't even like me

Repeat 1
Repeat 1

Oh boy, it's all the love that you've given
They mad cuz all this love they missing
That's why they stay up in my business
They are up in our business

Repeat 1

Why y'all in my business
Heh, get a job</pre>
