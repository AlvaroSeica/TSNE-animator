[Verse 1]
Why oh why must you swoop through the hood?
Like everybody from the hood is up to no good
You think all the girls around here are trickin
Up there looking like superchicken
At night i see your light through the bedroom window
But i ain't got nothing but the pad and pencil
I can't wait till i hear you say
''I'm going down mayday, mayday'' I'm gonna clown
Cause everytime that the pigs have got me
Y'all rub it in with the flying Nazi
Military force, But we don't want ya
Standin' on my roof wit the rocket launcher
So fly like an eagle
But don't follow us wherever we go
The head that i'm kicking, Make sure it's heard
I wanna kill you and ya punk-ass ghetto bird

[Chorus 2x]
Run, Run, Run from the ghetto bird

[Verse 2]
Now
My homie's here to lick on a trick for a rolex
And let me try the four next
Now the four i was driving was hotter than July
Looked up and didn't see it whippin in the sky
Saw a chopper with numbers on the bottom
''Calling all cars, I think we've got em!''
I hit the gas and i mashed past Inglewood
I think i drove through every single hood
South Central, Compton, and Watts
Long Beach, Bust a U, Here come the cops
Wish i had a genie wit about three wishes
Metal flake green on D's, I look suspicious
You know that i'm running, Damn i hear it humming
Look, I see it coming
Is it a bird? Yep Is it a plane? No
I hit me a right on El Segundo
Wanted to holla, Had to ditch the Impala
Let's see if they would folla
Me hit a fence, hit a fence, and another
Met me a baby pitbull and his mother
Ran up in some people's house and looked out the window
I wish it was my ten-fo'
Had to pull a strap on a fool named Louis the third
Cause i'm getting chased by the ghetto bird

''Just put his hat, ehrrr, he combed his hair and then put his hat back on.
Errr, he's acting nonchalant up there in that cockpit, going 115 miles an hour
With the police chasing him. Ehm, They're not gonna be real happy when they
Catch up with him, No matter what, the uh, Ehrr, they hate, they hate a big mouth even worse.''

[Verse 3]
Officer Bird's on his way and i don't wanna see him
Could you please give me the keys to the B.M.?
See, I didn't wanna gank you
But don't make me bank you, Thank you
Tried to get to the hood and you might guess
That a fool like me done shot Cyrus
Incognito, Ghetto eagle
Saying ''Damn, Where did he go?''
I bust me a left on Rubellon Park
The 735 and i'm bailin'
Went to my homegirl's house and got a hug man
She helped me run like Harriet Tubman
Looked out the window by the black bed
I saw the pigs and the four on a flatbed
Then the light from the bird hit me in the face
I close the blinds cause i didn't wanna catch a case
All that night i heard the birds circle
While i was eating fish and watching Urkel
She said i could sleep on the couch
By 2AM, I was digging her out
Kill the ghetto bird

''Which way is he going now?''
''Ok, now, now he's, he's actually southbound, on a service street
And, uh, Gee wiz, uh, I'm gonna get my maps out here and figure
out which service street he suddenly turned off on. Uh, the sheriffs
are, are, well i know that, sheriff's ground units got thrown off''

I wanna kill you and your punk-ass ghetto bird </pre>
