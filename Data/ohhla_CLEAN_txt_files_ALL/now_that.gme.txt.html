[Intro: Mele]
{*FIRE!!!!!*} Ooooh-nooo
Now that I'm paid, yeahh
Oooooh-whooooo~!

[Rick Ross]
Ridin in a cab, but I'm dreamin of a slab
Fifteen ounces at a time, pussy nigga do the math
Ten nice chains, +Prince+ like +James+
The day I made the stack in the trap my life changed
Y'all rides swingaz; we ride Daytons
It don't matter where you from (uhh) haters stay hatin
Keep the windows tinted, artillery when I'm in it
Whip it in the kitchen before Hillary became a Clinton
Assholes by nature, cash flow is major
In the old school, off M-codes of Kroger's
Started with a crumb, and turned it to a brick
They were calling me a bum, my turn - I'm the shit (ha!)
Razor flip things, age of fifteen (hello!)
Parked the Chevy in that thang, glazed like Krisp' Kreme
Rolls on the wrist when the shows ain't exist
Now my money long enough to put the 4's on the 6 (BOSS!)

[Chorus: Mele]
I pulled up front to the club
with the do's in the sky (and now that I'm paid)
I shut down the mall like a boss
cause I gotta be fly (and now that I'm paid, yeah)
Pop all the bottles I want
Models I want, to hit 'em and do it cause
I'm gettin all of this money
Ain't nobody gon' stop me, now that I'm paid

[The Game]
Duffels full of Franklins, carpoolin with Boss
Army medal on that burgundy Ghost, fuck what it cost
Umbrellas in the doors, Audemars in the dash
Wale in that Ferrari but this Phantom on his ass~!
We gon' spend this money, it's whatever, let them things pop
Kids gon' be aight cause daddy invested in WingStop
Money and residuals comin like it's a ritual
Drinking this liquid money, them bottles gon' be invisible
Fuck the rest of you petty cash niggaz, I'm invincible
Glocks identical, remove niggaz from the physical
Smokin that dual exhaust; flossin, fuckin them haters
And finger fuckin the waitress while sippin this Ace of Spades
I'm throwin money for nothin, Hawaiian kush I be puffin
Sharin hoes with my crew while these other niggaz be cuffin
Know she love that money game, stay fuckin with double M
Think a nigga 'bout to put her in that bubble Benz
Don't let the devil in!

[Chorus]

[Interlude: Mele]
Fuck you niggaz, we've got all these hoes
(We got all these hoes)
All this money, let me put you on
(All this money in my hand)
I said fuck you niggaz
We got all these hoes
All this money, let me put you on
(Let me put you on)

[Chorus]</pre>
