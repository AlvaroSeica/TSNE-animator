[Verse 1]
What? Aiyyo "it's Saturday night" and the show flowed smoothly
Cause the attention from her eyes, they both arrived mutually
Led by the lines of blurred out groupies
Tryna get past me in their tight khaki loose leaf
Paper-thin skirts to flirt with the moody overseas act
Her lips pierced my nerves like the swoop of an axe
I was halfway swingin, had me re-arranging my sack
Cringin with the way I would act
A hack, just tryna kick back, you know - relax
After our pupils had made contact
Beautiful long plats, truthful I'm on that
The crucial long chats came much later
With Dutch courage in my favour
I made the move towards my newfound neighbour
Sloppy and drunk, I played the respirator
And let her get the flavour, from this little innovator
We exchanged the words however, I was disturbed
I wanted to become a student
Within the union of her learning curves
This bird had large feathers, a magnificent span
I was under the weather, yet tried the best to be the man
"Can you buy me a drink?" Sweaty palms tryna get it together
But damn I was in a jam, pure aid plan but Dan could stand
So he lands a kiss "mwa", slips and I bit her lip
A little bit awkward, paused with a moment of silence
She turns and starts walking, it was perfect timing
Lining up for another drink by the bar
By the stars, by the sight of that stink
I'm not gonna take any more time to think
I blink and she's gone, but she'll be back in the second verse of this song
Blink, gone, second verse of this song, come on

"La di da di,
Saturday night and we like to party"
