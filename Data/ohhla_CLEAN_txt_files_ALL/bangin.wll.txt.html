(Fire!)
(Hey!)

[Chorus - Paul Wall]
I got that trunk cracked, windows tinted (hey)
Trunk cracked, windows tinted (hey)
Slowly rolled and I'm bangin screw (hey)
Slowly rolled and I'm bangin screw (uh huh)
Comin down so fly-y-y-y
Smokin leaf so high-h-h-h
Slowly rolled and I'm bangin screw
Slowly rolled and I'm bangin screw (cheah)

[Verse 1 - Paul Wall]
What it do, it's Paul to the Wall, trunk up tall, let the four screens fall
Spiders crawl, gon' turn up the dial and the heads all nod like a bobble head doll
Bendin corners up and down Wayside, from Greens Road to that Antoine Drive
Crew on the side playin NBA Live, I'm too cool for school, ridin on buckhide
Turnin heads when I'm on that Scott
Hit that French's for a quick pit stop
Boys in the mail talkin about they on top
Eight months later all them boys flop
Like it or not, I'm in the game and I'm showin up
Keke got that oil and we pourin up
Hit the club with Captain Jack and Big Steve representin my hood, I'm still throwin up
Big money in the game 'cause the bread grow
Candy old school drop top for the ho
Boys used to be sleepin on me but The Champ is here, I guarantee that they ass woke
Ridin on spokes, that's the elbow, still rockin in the ice white shell toe
This for my buzz but I don't care so, and you already know

[Chorus]

[Verse 2 - Paul Wall]
Yeah, I'm still on that 59 but might see me on the 58 comin down
All over the town I like to get around, jammin my Fat Pat screwed up underground
Comin down in the lime green '88
While them boys on the sideline want to hate
Bumpin Kid Paul, fuckin up the state plate
I must admit my life's great
T. Ferris with me in the snow bunny Benz
lookin through a Louie lens and we stackin up ends
Bros over hoes, yeah I'm talkin about friends
got 'Freedom' on my arm for my dog Lil' Twin
Dubs on the rim that's TIS
Just like Pretty Todd I'm +G-Boy Fresh+
Got oil comin in and it's straight from the West
and the grill chrome mesh on the Cadillac crest
Head of the best, I ain't messin with the rest
Santa Claus sled that's pomegranate red
Sippin the taste, I take it straight to the head
and the Swishahouse is what I rep 'til I'm dead

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - Paul Wall]
I'm tippin fo's and I'm sippin fo's and I'm flippin hoes with my partner clue
Posted up at that TSU or that Prairie View with my partner Lew
Hawk, boys get outlined in chalk, tryin to run up and jack my slab
This one here for my boy Lil' Ke, I'm throwin the deuce up and givin boys dab
Pourin the juice up and grippin that Ave, wavin hood so the bass showcase
Settin the trends, steady choppin up wind with a diamond ice grin, that paper I chase
Take a fade by that Bad Boy Shop, tip up slow, I'm screwed up and chopped
Listenin to some of that Robert Earl or them Choppaholics, maybe that Michael Watts
Choppin the block up, holdin a full cup, breakin a strut and now I'm on new swang
Grill and woman popped trunk full of bang, I'm third coast grade and I'm drippin stain
I'm hittin stank tryin to break that bread, slowed and throwed 'til the day I'm deceased
Leanin tough, I got a cup full of stuff with a starched crease and a Johnny Dang piece

[Chorus]

(Hey!)
(Hey!)
(Hey!)
(Hey!)
(Hey!)
(Cheah!)</pre>
