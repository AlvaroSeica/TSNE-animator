Niggas can't tell me shit about this
Legendary for some time hah
We keep getting it
Tell em niggas we keep getting it hah
We ain't never gonna stop
Nah no
Hah!

Fuck all you critics that doubt me, always talking about me
I got the fuck out New York, took my talents decided
She doesn't make me less realer, I'm surrounded by killas
I just tell yap to go yap em and blow some nails in the villa
My brother Percy and Rickers, faith in that life bro
I swear them people dream that life function like label
My baby girl is my heart, see the world through her eyes
So I gotta go get it and surf them turbulent skies
Know the boys is on me, I'm still duckin and weaving
Knowin damn well they comin to a nigga now breathe in
Let's play this game called the facts, strictly the facts
If you sayin the truth then that is a fact

I smack the shit out yo favorite rapper â that is a fact
You wanna blow I can make it happen â that is a fact
All my niggas is getting money longerine max
Ya heard that yellow tape ain't sap, you knew it was crack

Did it a long time and I made it a known fact
Niggas is gone sitting on thrones, we're the only stat
Uh so many kings, you're more like Lord district
Got 4 chains on, does that make me different?

And the angels sing
You hear them bitches singin?

I need to pick a place in the back now
I'm in the kitchen, crack heads in the background
I love strippers so I'm a change the weather
Chinchilla dogs, too cold fuck the leather
Pimp fat with the feather, now I'm golden
So is the Rollie, gold Magnums only
Paul Bera, knee deep in the pussy
Hangover, must be the roofy
Kilo of gold from King Tut's tomb
Been the don since I came out the room
Circled the block, look at the roof before I get topped
You know what I'm about
Let's get it

Flat top to London, not talkin bout tires
Yes pretty girl, you just been hired
No longer public housing
Ceilings to the sky now that's 3 thousand

And the angels sing
You hear them bitches singin?
Get em, girls
And the angels sing
You hear them bitches singin?
