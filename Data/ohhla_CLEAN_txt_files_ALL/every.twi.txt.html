Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I'd be on my grind all day and I play all night
but baby you're on my mind every step of the way girl
can't get you out my head
even when you're not there
baby you're on my mind every step I take girl
oooh woah woah woah woah woah
oooh woah woah woah woah
every step I take girl

every step is breathtaking
this love is worth making
that's why I ain't faking
can't wait to say I'm taken
by you my new boo
can't wait to take you from school
like how was your day what you learn what you do?
uh that's interesting well I leanred something cool
there's no problem in this worl that could divide us too
who would ever knew I'd be here alone with you
came a long way not being cocky it's just what I do
I'd be on my grind all day alright
but don't get it twisted I grind better at night
ha ha I'm just joking we be making love for sure
and if you call get no answer I just want you to know

I'd be on my grind all day and I play all night
but baby you're on my mind every step of the way girl
can't get you out my head
even when you're not there
baby you're on my mind every step I take girl
oooh woah woah woah woah woah
oooh woah woah woah woah
every step I take girl

it was like love at first sight
it's something like when a boyfriends in love with his first mic or win
I got with ym and got my first flight
or before that growing up with my first bite
girl you were something else but as much as that something is
I could'ntsee nothing else I hope I'm just right cause I can't be nothing else
and I plan to give you the world girl till there's nothing left
welcome to the good life the like I said before life
and you're best thing to happen this world girl before rice
love in the air baby I remember those nights
now it's back to work girl the fashion fame and limelight

I'd be on my grind all day and I play all night
but baby you're on my mind every step of the way girl
can't get you out my head
even when you're not there
baby you're on my mind every step I take girl
oooh woah woah woah woah woah
oooh woah woah woah woah
every step I take girl</pre>
