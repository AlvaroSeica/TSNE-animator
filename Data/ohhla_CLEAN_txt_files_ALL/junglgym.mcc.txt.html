AHH COOL~! Look, a jungle gym
I love the jungle!
(One thing I don't understand about jungle gyms)
(is they're not jungles, and they're not gyms)
(And my dad says that they have a name that doesn't make any sense)
(There's no jungles, there's no gym)
Well your dad's got a point
but I certainly do like climbing up on them
and like, climbing down, the jungle gym
And sometimes I pretend that I'm a monkey!
(Yeah you can sway, and you can move your arms)
(this way and that way, and you pick little)
(gnits off your body, and pretend that you're)
(an ape or a silverback gorilla)
Or an orangutan or a lemur!!!</pre>
