Yo, you hear them sirens

When you messin with the funk (yeah)
You bumpin in your trunk (yeah)
You know it's what you want (yeah)
So just bump, the bump, da-bump
Bump, bump, bump it up

[CHORUS]
Bounce boo to the boog-a-die beat

Fuck em go call them cops and
Watch em kids walk and start boppin
Heads to what that DJ droppin
