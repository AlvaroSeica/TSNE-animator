[M.O.P.]
Dis da Mash Out Posse baby
Lemme tell y'all somethin
When we go to war
We go all the way to motherfuckin war

[Verse One: Billy Danze]
(OKAY!) I never accepted the glroy
I gave you the story, and showed you how I do it
(MY WAY!) It's the warrior tactics, I'm tellin you bastards
your back is really no match for this ratchet
(LET'S SAY!) You studied the criminal minds
Specifically mine, you'd be amazed at the shit you would find
(B.K.!) Got a nigga twisted
So I rips it like I rip cause I'm gifted, so
(TO-DAY!) Rap is my profession
And the omens I posess would make me do it with aggression
(AL-WAYS!) M dot, O dot, P dot, forever we hot
Whatever we drop, together we not
(GON' PLAY) Fizzy Wo', William Berkowitz
Witty ways, smooth out your gritty ways, send you to a grave
(WE SAY) If you're comfortable across town
Stay across town, Brownsville put it down

[Chorus: Billy Danze]
It's the M dot O dot P dot (P!!!)
Stop, 'fore you get one of these, slammed in your face
Murder should be the case - nigga this is suicide
Got homies that'll climb up out the sewers when we ride
It's the M dot O dot P dot (P!!!)
Stop before you get one of these, slammed in your face
Murder should be the case - nigga this is suicide
Got homies that'll climb up out the sewer when we ride

[Verse Two: Lil' Fame]
(OKAY!) We notice your mouth been runnin for years
Count your threshold of evils up to lessen some of your fears
(MY WAY!) It's the way of the real, the way of the 'Ville
One day at a time, one day of the crime
(LET'S SAY!) You misunderstood, the ways of a thug
The ways of the hood, you wouldn't survive in
(B.K.!) It'll be an express way to the morgue
Niggaz quick to lay you off, A-S-P-C-A of justice
(MY WAY!) 

[Danze] It's the M dot O dot P {*dot P* - repeat}

[Outro]
It's the Mash Out Posse
