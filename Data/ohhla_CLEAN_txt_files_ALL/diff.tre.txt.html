[Trey Songz]
There's never been a day, that I
Felt the kinda way, that I'm feelin now
I think my life done turned around
There's never been a girl that changed
Change the way the way I looked at thangs, oh I
I swear I'm up and out the game in a minute

[Chorus 2X: Trey Songz]
Cause I'm walkin, different
Talkin different
Thinkin different, baby girl
My - hustling's missin
Touchin, kissin
Huggin, missin
You got me lovin, trippin

[Brandon Hines]
Trey I know what you sayin I think I met the same chick
Does she have a tattoo of a bunny rabbit on her hip?
Matter fact I think she told me 'bout this R&amp;B nigga
I wasn't payin attention, she was fine, so I figured
I would pour some Hennessy, get her tipsy where I want her
But little did I know shs had me right where she want me
And now I'm wakin up thinkin I really put it down
She left me a note sayin I'll see you around

[Chorus] w/ ad libs

[Brandon Hines]
How could I let myself get caught up
I know I got that work, I'm like what the f.. ooh
She got me trippin thinkin I'm in love
All because the way she gave it up

[Chorus] 3X w/ ad libs</pre>
