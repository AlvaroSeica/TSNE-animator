It's ya boy Heav D! (Ohhhhhhhhh!!!!)
(Wait a minute) Anthony Hamilton! Come on!

[Chorus: Anthony Hamilton] (Heavy D)
I can't stop myself, from, loving, you, girl
It's like magic when we touch, and you know it means so much
(Come on dream with me baby)
I can count the ways, I, feel about, you
All the little things you do, keep me runnin back to you

[Verse One: Heavy D]
Check me out ma I swear to God I feel the same way
And I like to see you now and then and each and every day
No matter how you slice it, I ain't supposed to wife it
I like it, plus you make me feel like you were right with
The things that I do, like when i pass through
With the powder blue convertible come through you
Smile so big makes me feel like a kid
When we reminiscin 'bout the things that we did
Forgettin structure, can't wait to touch ya
I love ya, can't get enough of ya
What you want me to do huh? Tell me now what you want me to do ma?
Show me how! Come on!

[Chorus: Anthony Hamilton]
I can't stop myself, from, loving, you, girl

(And you know it!) I can count the ways, I, feel about, you
All the little things you do, keep me runnin back to you

[Verse Two: Heavy D]
Aiyyo! How many times you been through it?
How many times you eyes welled up with fluid?
How many times you said I ain't do it? And you still true through it
Knowin damn well that I did it, but you chose to forget it and live with it
Shit! Where I'm a find that at?
Someone to hold me down like that, get my back like that
Nobody but you I be a fool to fool with somebody but you
How you wanna handle it? Take time, untangle it
All the drama you manage it, you ain't allowed to dangle it
Ok...Let's keep it movin mama
Forget yesterday and focus on tomorrow

[Chorus: Anthony Hamilton]
I can't stop myself, from, loving, you, girl
It's like magic when we touch (It's like magic!)
and you know it means so much (Where is that dream baby!!!!)
I can count the ways, I, feel about, you
All the little things you do, keep me runnin back to you

[Verse Three: Heavy D]
Aiyyo! Now, who 'gon give you keys to the crib?
Who 'gon, treat you right and, show you how to live
Who 'gon keep you lookin big? Keep you like you dig?
Keep you out the gutter, keep you lookin butter
Keep you laced up, hait and face made up
Pocket caked up, backed bills paid up
Be happy that you stayed up
All night made up, made love, now we straight up 

[Bridge: Anthony Hamilton]
I like your sense your humor, your charm girl rips right through me
Whatever you want! Whatever you need! All for incredible you!
Anytime that you want me for company!
Just call and I'll be there for ya!
Whatever you want! Whatever you need! All for incredible you!

[Chorus: Anthony Hamilton]
I can't stop myself, from, loving, you, girl
It's like magic when we touch, and you know it means so much
(Incredible Incredible you!!!!)
I can count the ways, I, feel about, you
All the little things you do, keep me runnin back to you
