Anti living in the world on the outside
never grew accustom to the customs of the inside
couldn't fit the puzzle due to how let the pen glide....
Plus my razor is literal for a thin line
So outings within time become jaded when the colorful world becomes faded
And what's up under the world becomes
Adjacent same equivalent basement
Strange shit
The hell you wish you could escape
is now a neighbor with music banging early on the wake up
Bill on break up highs over lows
keep the pilot light glowing like the sky at this moment in time
Refine life's lines as my opus self approved certified dopeness
aint like I know it because I sat down and wrote it
But I sure as hell know it aint bullshit!

Chorus:
Treat a dream like a means to an end speaking words
from the scrolls verbs from the soul adding light to the mic
through the glow submerged in the flow words from the soul (repeat)

A black man with a dream in his hands only thing is fam I don't rap for the fans
My thought patterns perform songs beyond norm
I'm on some down to earth shit the world aint ready for
grew up on breaking and beat street galore
but nowadays most niggas just break dance for sport
Dj's want you to pay em to play joints but I don't consider that support....
Must got a supply of get high on stash
telling me that you can't put mine on blast
For free
Fuck day glow and finders fee cause when its all said and done
all you find is me rocking these beats like biz on the wind pipe
coming out the back ground turning up the fahrenheit 
ause I still remember what it was like
that's why I still crush mics</pre>
