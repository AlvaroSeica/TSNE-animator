G. Rap Giancana, I'm not the one that's prone to be this
So let me make this clear for you just like the stones on my wrist
Just cause the door close don't mean I'm on the phone with a chick
I'm just a cat about his BI and that's on the get rich
Straight up politicking, so where you lay your dome will be sittin 
Stack cake, keep food on the plate, and chrome on the six
Then we can make a little fam just us alone in the sticks
And I could get rid of these bricks and be gone from the strip, you know

[Jonell]
Yeahhh yeahhh yeahhh
I try and I try to stop the forces that go round in my head and I
Thought you were the one to understand me
You turned my dark skies to light
But once again you turned my hopes to pain
My soul's the same, my tears start blendin in the rain
Fallin again, fallin again

[Chorus] - repeat 2X
I really don't know what you came here for
Round and around we go
Sendin your bags outside the door
Round and around we go

[Jonell]
If you don't understand where I'm comin from
Then my heart is tellin me you're not the one
All the games you played I now realize
You're not the one, for me no more so baby bye bye
Pack yo bags and get to steppin
You got to let it go you need to stop trippin
I hope you don't think I'm a let you back in
cause youse a fool

[Chorus] ­ repeat 2X

[Jonell]
It's gonna rain, it's gonna rain
It's gonna rain, it's gonna rain
It's gonna rain, it's gonna rain
It's gonna rain, it's gonna rain

[Kool G. Rap]
Eh yo boo
Why you rockin this if I played you out of pocket
You and your girls link and gossip, I put links on your locket 
Nearly fiend for the bank deposit, minks in the closet
Bought you flowers and baked chocolate, candy paint on the hot shit
You know how much I dropped to cop the ring with the watch kid
With enough bling to make somebody eyes spring out the socket
Now all you can do curse flit like I deserve this 
Lucked up out the gutter now you on some suburb shit
Eat off platinum platters, I know the furs and the raves don't matter
But yo boo, from the time we met, even that thing got fatter
Come on, what I did so bad for you to act so stink
What u want me to do, put you on top of the bathroom sink
Take a trip sit on the beach in Cancun for drinks
Everything I spit to you the real, no room for pranks
Feel me (feel me, feel me)

[Jonell]
To-day I made up my mind.. to get away
Every day, I sit and pray, every day, every day
To-day I made up my mind.. to get away
Every day, I sit and pray, every day, every day

[Chorus] ­ 2x

[Jonell]
Today I'm gonna take a little time
(I really don't know what you cam here for)
(Round and around we go) to get away
(Sendin your bags outside the door)
every day I sit and pray.. every day
(Round and around we go)
Every day (round and around we go)
To get away, away, away, away (round and around we go)
Hi-Tek (round and around we go)
Round and round, round and round (round and around we go)
We go round, and, round
We go in-side-out (round and around we go)
We go back, and, forth
We go round, and round (round and around we go)
Did you hear me?</pre>
