[Intro: Klondike Kat]
Yo Will, will, it's ninety two
So what the fuck we're gonna do?

[Chorus: Klondike Kat]
Pass the Piote' like we used to say, hay!
Pass the Piote' like we used to say, hay!
Pass the Piote' like we used to say, hay!
Pass the Piote' like we used to say, hay!
Willie D, what the fuck you got to say?

[Verse One: Willie D]
Tickie-pow, Tick-a-pow, Tick-a-pow-pow, POW!
Buckle up, buckle up, right now
Sixteen rounds coming at ya, and I bet you
At least one of you whores'll need a stretcher
Break them down, break them down
Break them down, break them down
Niggaz in my clique don't fuck around
And we bound, to do something vicious
Dead sisters and even your bitches will need stitches
Bang bang that's my thing homeboy
So what you want with Willie D homeboy?
Better be more peace than a little bit
Cause your ass will get smoked like a cigarette
(Where they at? Where they at? Where they at?)
Boom boom, when my gat do shit like that
Flop flop, motherfucking fist fist
Oh! what I relief it is? (Buck them down)

[Chorus:]
Pass the Piote' like we used to say, hay!
Pass the Piote' like we used to say, hay!
Pass the Piote' like we used to say, hay!
Pass the Piote' like we used to say, hay!
Icy Hott, what the fuck you got to say?

[Verse Two: Icy Hott]
Me gun goes buck buck, boom boom 
Ripping the meat out your chest
You must don't know how to wear the motherfucking bullet proof vest
Smack the 911 that come to rescue you 
And if you cops came early, they'll be packed up too
You shouldn't have to fuck Icy Hott, the aggravated raster
Just as quick as my tongue can move my bobby and weave as faster
Cheap Military breaking them jaws everyday
Pass the Piote' like we used to say

[Chorus:]
Pass the Piote' like we used to say, hay!
Pass the Piote' like we used to say, hay!
Pass the Piote' like we used to say, hay!
Rasir X, what the fuck you gotta say?

[Verse Three: Rasir X]
Punk niggaz getting madness, acting scandalous 
And taking chances, getting their ass dropped to the fucking candies
So what you think about a nigga now, nigga?
Ka-pow nigga, Ka-pow nigga, pow nigga
The compliments of the Rasir, that's how I mace ya 
Make no mistakes, buck shots in your face
I'm bopping and weaving and sticking moving nigga like hooking
A Jammie jam I shook, I got the click for that whole shit trick

[Chorus:]
Pass the Piote' like we used to say, hay!
Pass the Piote' like we used to say, hay!
Pass the Piote' like we used to say, hay!
Pass the Piote' like we used to say, hay!
Yo Sho, what the fuck you gotta say?

[Verse Four: Sho]
Just a square fool
And a nigga gonna square off a blow to your chest 
And your head, and try to tear up
But you don't really wanna rumble
Cause I'm possessing a blow, that will make a fucking bull stumble
If I'm caught in that mix, a nigga gotta click, pop that bullshit
Your ass is headed to a ditch
Bumping my Piote' if your fist get fucked
You better fire up a spliff inside his big-ass truck

[Chorus:]

[Outro: Klondike Kat]
You see, me got a machete, yes me got to kill
Yes me coming to kill them suckers and they're coming at will
Klondike Kat, it's me, you better leave and hop out
Me coming out nonstop, me coming to drop on the rock
POW! ha ha ha ha ha, haaaahhh
Somebody pass the Piote' ha ha ha, goddamn!
Rough, raw, bust, blow, pow, pop, fully blow, busting make it rough
Rough, raw, bust, blow, pow, pop, fully blow, busting make a blow
Rough, raw, bust, blow, pow, pop, fully blow, busting make them bluff
Make a blow, make a blow, make them bluff, make them bluff
Buttie-busting
ote' like we used to say, hay!
Pass the Piote' like we used to say
Pass the Piote' like we used to say
Like that</pre>
