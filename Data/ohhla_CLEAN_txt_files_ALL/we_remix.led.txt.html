You want that night out?I got that night grill
You want that matrix?then choose the right pill

same clothes every week and yall ain't seein my wealth
on the low.i keep a bankroll like (Fresh!)
cocktail dress by John Galiano
in a restaraunt owned by Taliano's
I'm a boss bitch my last name should be Soprano
switchin up phones so them boys can't follow
they tryin to lead me to the old adress
I left a note too and ain't been back since
I'm in a new state, a new place with new plates
shit damn near a new face
so by the time they try to build them a new case
I'm gone like yesterday - what?

[Chorus]

[Young Jeezy]
Look - I am the streets
real niggas shit and thats word to meet you
she like my wrist so she follow the rainbow
now I'm switchin lanes she tryin to follow the lambo
Can't keep up bitch follow the Range Rove'
but be cool cause my goons in there
and a couple of guns and a couple of clips
and a couple of K's and a couple of bricks
and then I throw it in the pot
now what the fuck that cook like?
Mark Jacobs don't know what the fuck I look like
Hey -this a remix ain't it?
Just copped a new 'rarri and I just might paint it
Just copped a new plane and I just might fly it
Just left atlantic mall and I just might buy it
Stay strapped nigga don't even try it
Pockets so fat I need to go on a diet

[Chorus]
