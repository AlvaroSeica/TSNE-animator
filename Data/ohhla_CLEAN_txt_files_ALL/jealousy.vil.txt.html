[All]
You know...if you make moves some people will envy
Say what's (what's) up with this jealousy

[Chorus]
You know people say shit, bout you, and me
Uh-Huh what's up with this jealousy (one more time ya'll)
Uh-Huh what's up with this jealousy (yes...yes...yes)
Uh-Huh what's up with this jealousy

[T3]
Yes ya'll (ya'll)
I love it when you hate
Now lets calculate, take it straight to straight
Take it, to your face or wherever you lay
Oh you say 'You fake' And won't take shit to your face
See in the first place, you made a crucial mistake
My crew congregates just to aggravate
With plots to infiltrate and abbreviate
And if you think we out, shit we got rhythm for days
Take it to another phase with an extra stage
Havin' you feelin' the blaze of NWA
And if they ask you 'Who you doin'' tell 'em 'that nigga Tres'
Yeah damn right I'm great, like the porno tapes
An ??? For ladies and collecting papes
To these jealous niggas let the ??? Made
??? Your man ain't got time for the fake
To those 'J' niggas need to put 'em away

[Chorus]
You know people say shit, bout you, and me
Uh-Huh what's up with this jealousy
Uh-Huh what's up with this jealousy
Uh-Huh what's up with this jealousy

[Baatin]
Spread the word, that nigga's hardcore
Envious Emcee, lyrics are *Cagore*
Rhythm up, cause I'm the real Jack Ripper (Uh-huh)
I call him Jack Trippin' Over (Uh-huh)
Who call himself passin' over tryin to provoke
The High Priest got you in my step-era
Impious niggas I don't trust
Started when emcees when the accurate-
Rackin' a nigga, step back causin' a crush
I'm good in this game, my mind left you in the dust
Check my mic when I bust you got tossed
Lost you to cry, the jealous niggas wanna floss
I'm all in your face, grippin my nuts, nigga what, nigga what

Uh-huh what's up with this jealousy

[Chorus]
You know people say shit, bout you, and me
Uh-Huh what's up with this jealousy (Come on)
Uh-Huh what's up with this jealousy (One more time)
Uh-Huh what's up with this jealousy

[Jay Dee]
...Jealousy make you say what the fu-...
This goes out to my niggas that's talking the shit
Same niggas that be dubbing tapes and walking and shit
No life, having like a nigga that's stalking a bitch
No joke, broke, ya'll niggas be cracking me up
Player hating, plotting, and planning on jacking me up
Don't do it, you don't know these niggas is backing me up
Hardcore, fuck rap, ??? Nigga what
Hardcore, pimp smacking from acting like WHAT
Good shit, like the 55 in the back of a bus
Hot shit, SV yours whackin the fun
Don't get jealous cause the S is stacking 'em up
Say (what, what) say

[Chorus]
You know people say shit, bout you, and me
Uh-Huh what's up with this jealousy
Uh-Huh what's up with this jealousy
Uh-Huh what's up with this jealousy

Uh-Huh</pre>
