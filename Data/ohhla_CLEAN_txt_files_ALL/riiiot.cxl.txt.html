Verse One: Chino XL, Ras Kass

You prayed for me and I came!  How far you niggaz wanna push me?
I'm leaving the crowds happy like OJ Simpson when he got his first white pussy
But I'm still annoyed, blowin through your selenoid
Bringing more Blues to Brothers than Jon Belushi and Dan Akroyd
Governmently engineered like E Bola for this rap garage sale
by this industry, I'm trying not to get fucked like 2Pac in jail
You can hate me, but await me like I'm Magic Johnson's
death in a box with Jordan's pops that ass'll never take another breath
cuz, I write the songs like Barry Manilow
I like my Sugar Brown like Hugh Grant fucked D'Angelo

Now I got niggaz claimin they saw God unfortunately
He wasn't in the person of Master Farad Muhammad
Some often ask how can this nigga molest the English alphabet
in one hundred words or less it ain't the chronic
It's all in the mind like Johnny Mmemonic
Before my word is born, surgeons administer antibiotics
to drain the phonics, amniotic fluids
Delivery, to get Nia deep in your Peeples like Howard Hewett
Half-Hitler, half-Jewish, I'm gassed off myself

Icono-clismic, twisted without the use of fiber optics
Noxious I blows out the sockets I got your Adam's Apples in my pockets
Bullshit like Timmy McVey, like kiddie porn I'm getting popular

Popular, no ocular, MC's perp particular
but not quite yet perpendicular
Compound fractures fibulas when niggaz step, contest the upper torso
I got Chino's back like a dorsal, fin
Comprehend, we bend men from within

Chorus: Chino, Ras

Your strength in numbers couldn't hit
The yellow nigga from the Gravity click
You don't give a fuck as long as bud gets lit

You're fuckin with the HemiSidal lunatics
Like licorice, niggaz begin to twist

Lay back and watch your idols get ripped
Yo signify if your crew roll thick
(Yeah) East Coast (West Coast) beeeotch!!!

Verse Two: Ras Kass, Chino XL

I circumnavigate the globe with a one-liner like, latitude
Put my rhymes in mixed fortune cookies to leave Confucious confused
The day a nigga serve Ras is when faggots start straight bashing

Without Jermaine Dupri I'm SoSoDef that I need closed captions
Won't see me stressed from no East/West conflict
the interest Chino X/Ras Kass like Layne Tito removed you from your bench
My retina expands, my brain is trapped like a rat on a running wheel
Praise the yellow God or I'ma leave you scarred like that nigga Seal
Vernacular understandable, you in a hearse, megahertz, the truth hurts
Slang botanical, you're moving on time-lapse camera
Indestractable, dig me like an excavation multiracial valuable
Take you out like Saafir took out Casual

So check the milk that Jersey made
I turn artistic children bilingual
On parallel bars I create new dismounts like Chechincko

So keep it short and sweet like Sherman Hemsley bonafide queer
While I shoot shit up you're shooting gerbils up your asshole like Richard Gere

Verse Three: Ras Kass, Chino XL

Bitch ass niggaz what see?
I gives a fuck who's certified platinum or gold
Cause I got rhymes for every unit you sold
Your plaques corrode when I collage colloquials
At first the buzz was local but now the nose grows like Pinnochio
No lie, no T-H-C, T-H-E, T-H-O-U-G-H-T
Makes me high in intelligence quotient
I drop facts like attache
Exfoliate rap and come cleaner than Jeru's enema
What's the secret within my esophagus
is discovered like Tutenkahmen's sarcophogous
I got niggaz lookin for Webster's like George Papadopolous

Yo Ras pardon me my unfamiliar soliloquies, similies
similar to Reginald Denny's, facial injuries
You couldn't locate my transient thoughts with lo-jack
Molest your mind like Oprah Winfrey's behind when she was a small child
Punchlines with more elasticity than Biggie's stretch marks
Chino X sparks, mad urban
I ain't scared to put the things that going around me
on tape like Mark Fuhrman
Sexing picture perfect hoes like Pocahontas often
And I'd rather hear Willie Nelson than fucking Montell Jordan!

Chorus

Outro: Chino

Uhh, yeah
Uhh, signify, uhh
Uhh, check it out, uhh
West coast, uhh, East coast, what?
West coast, East coast
West, uhh, East, ahh
Uhh, that nigga Ras, that nigga Chino
The nigga bird, yo that shit is large</pre>
