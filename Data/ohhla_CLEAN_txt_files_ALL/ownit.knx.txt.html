[Intro: Bumpy Knuckles]
To the beat y'all, salute to hip hop all the time
The greatness, yo

[Verse One: Bumpy Knuckles]
This is Premo to the next level
And I'm smilin at you hatin ass niggas revel
I bring bass to your treble, trouble, devil
Fo' fifth to your lung, now take off the bezel
I'm the prodical heartical in the rap article particles laugh 
I go hard at you, gettin away, I make it hard to do
I watched alot of rappers, in the last twelve years
Lose faith, 'cause sun don't in they space
It's a continous grind, with the culture in mind
Stop talkin like bitches, and shut up and rhyme
Salute to dj's that really do it
New rhymes with an old style attached to it
It's time to "Make That Move" Shalamar, Howard Hewitt
I can't forget that old style duke I used to do it, fluent
To say you started it is wack, shit, the flow is classic
You know if you was diggin through them discount baskets
Jewelry just to dressin
To strip you down of raw skills purify the lesson
Alot of niggas think because they rhyme on Premo that could validate your skill
Yeah but we know, that that's not the real scenario
Like Milo, Dinco and Brown, on stage without Busta
Huh that's not the real scenario
Real niggas listen, I'm noticin that hip hop is splittin
Into branches, like trees do
Sayin you the next one and you 'gon save the game
Well please do, we need you (COME ON!)
HUH! DJ's are sellin out, faster than cheap cars
MC's are sellin their best bars for cheap 'cause
Ain't nobody payin, and ain't no wage or nothin
These corny niggas is sayin, what game are you playin? (COME ON!)
When niggas used to say yo, you heard what he said?
But now they say yo, I heard that, but lyrics is dead
When's the next one? And try not to be so versey 
Can you start it off with controversy, put a hook on it
360 and you rockin for that label paper 
Now your money's gone and you can't eat 'cause the crooks own it

[Outro: DJ Premier Scratchin]
