[Verse One]
When we were young
Life was so unjust
At times I felt it was just us
Mama working hard to put food on the table
All on her own she sacrificed
Even when my brothers and sisters died
Some how she stayed strong
I never saw her cry
I was the oldest and responsibility was so immense
The tension, we'd disagree
So I left, at the time I felt she hated me
Told me to be strong
Told me to hang on, hugged me tight
And said "Big sister it'll be alright"

[Chorus]
Brother, I love ya
Little brother
I thank God for ya every day
Little Brother
I Love Ya
And I pray He'll never take you away

[Verse Two]
When my soul withered and I lived in the dark
An emptiness it filled my heart
You never stopped holdin' me
Never stopped tryin' to open me up
The days and nights I spent stressin'
The years I spent In depression
This is my confession
Thought about ending it sometimes
But the second you crossed my mind
I knew, I could never leave you
Made me believe
You set me free
To this day, all I say and do, I owe it all to you

[Repeat Chorus]

[Verse Three]
Ooh,
I would lie for you
Cry for you
Ride or die for you
Touch the sky for you
If you asked me to
There's nothin I wont do
I took this life for joke
I would drink or smoke
To ease away the pain 
And forget the memories up in my brain
But you helped me to stop the rain
Oh brother brother...

[Repeat Chorus]</pre>
