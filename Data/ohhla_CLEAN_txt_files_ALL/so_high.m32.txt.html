(*talking*)
Man, I'm higher than a bitch ya feel
It go down, got this bad lil' som'ing some'ing
Riding with me, she can't blow without weed

[Hook: Jason Perry]
I get so high-high
I get so high-high-high
I get so high-high-high
I get so high-high-high

[Mr. 3-2]
I stay high like the cost of living, dro'd out
That monkey on my back, bad habits gotta stop
Overdose, and my tolerance high
Can't tell me nothing, cause I'm feeling real fly
No seeds or sticks, fluffy like popcorn
Firing a parillo, early in the morn'
Born to get money, Fatt Domino a fool
Getting high on your own supply, ain't cool
See boys off note, messing off they skull money
Ain't no party packs, can't get nothing from me
Ain't showing that I got, from my old school partna
And the price sealed up, that I bought from the doctor
It's all I need, to let my mind drift
And to make me some love, to a fat ass spliff
I trip never fall, got to maintain
On point on note, just me and Mary Jane

[Hook]

[Spice 1]
Chronic smoke flows, chrome 24's and dro
And my rims still spinning, when I stop at the sto'
Catch me and Mary Jane, wrapped up in menage-tois
With a chocolate filly, man I be getting so high
I smoke with a bong pipe, blunt or even zig-zags
Watch my girl stripping, blow the smoke up her ass
Blow, rub my hand on your thigh and tongue kiss ya
Sitting on the edge of the bed, looking sweet as a swisha
Then, me and you gon' get high tonight
Have sex smoke chronic, feeling fly as a kite
From hash one to chief, to the blueberry chronic
Let me see if my nigga Juvenile, got five on it
Man it's Eastbay love, let's roll up a be-legiter
Stick two blunts together, make a one hitter quitter
But I can never quit, puffing this sticky green shit
Catch me blowing chronic smoke, in the face of my pit

[Hook]

[Mr. 3-2]
Niggaz never chip in, but always got they hands out
Ducking a nigga dosha, and never drop out
On H2O, with a big cup of mud
Bout to pop some pills, 'fore I get my dick sucked
Turning the corner, while my a.c. blow
On 84's, about to resco'
I smoke to free, or make my broad sell cock
Another side of my hustle, while I break down blocks
On a gallon of Patron, getting a little tipsy
Behind the wheel, still doing a buck fifty
Blow smoke out my nose, staying in the rearview
Slow motion, stuck like super glue
Mr. 3-2, stay gone on good
With some'ing real jazzy, riding through the neighborhood
Yeah baby it's a daily thang, in my life
Stay lifted up, like a lil' cloud of kite

[Hook - 2x]</pre>
