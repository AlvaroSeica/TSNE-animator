[Hook 2X: Shabazz the Disciple]
It's not a thing, cuz my team's hotter, man
We got a bling, ching-ching, by the thing

[Shabazz the Disciple]
I got more bars than Nas, tight like shackles in mine
The minimum jacket, ya'll niggas is like Shaq on the line
Your wack on the line, you gotta get clapping for mine
Nigga Kobe, ya'll can't hold me on the track with the rhyme
My whole team is getting burn, while you riding the bench
I mean you got a few rings, but it's not on the strength
You know the game is All Pro, daddy, I shoot spinners
You be air dogs and bricks with that bullshit you scrimmage
Next season ya'll getting traded, to straight jazz
Now a pull up like Duncan, and bended off the brass
Got that nigga Carmelo from the Hook, tat on his neck
When my son shoot the j's, stritctly bottom of the net
We got the whole game, transition, man, listen
Stay cutting the lane like raw in my man's kitchen
I'm Reggie Miller downtown against the Knicks, man, swishing
Ya'll like Ewing, game in the shot, man missing
We bout to take it this year, Red Hook's behind me
We gon' pop champagne like the '90's Bulls dynasty
Stripping nigga, run a 3-on-1, on the fast break
Alley oop, on the backboard, now watch the glass break
Put your guard up on the half court trap, false the turnover
Pass it to my man, he pass it back, ya'll lost, burns over
Caught a kick and one, the way a nigga slice to the lane
And check, nigga, point game
Even if you tall like Matubi, ya'll getting jumped over
Crazy ups, nigga, Vince Carter, ya'll getting dumped over
Ya'll niggas had it on lock, now game over
No more slot time on the block, ya'll reign's over
We bring it to the rim, hard rock, now lane over
Point game, we bout to take this thang over
Ya'll niggas had it on lock, now game over
No more slot time on the block, ya'll reign's over
We bring it to the rim, hard rock, now lane over
Point game, we bout to take this thang over

[Chorus: Shabazz the Disciple (Yay-Yay)]
We gon' make it (point game, we about to take it)
We, we gon' make it (point game, we about to take it)
(Daddy, we gon' make it) Point game, we about to take it
Baby, we gon' make it (point game we) about to take it

[Hook 2X: Yay-Yay]

[Yay-Yay]
Name another chick who ball like this, I be the baddest
My name on the mic, strictly WNBA status
Sixteen like a Bronson Revolver
Long legs, crazy handle, the high maintance cross over
I be that go to girl like Cheryl Swoops
The legends in the game all respect my hoop
We going in, like Lisa Leslie and Cheryl Fall
Defensive award, cuz I dominate the boards
I bring the ball up cooked like Nikki Teaslie
Spitting through the half court track make it look easy
Hot straight off the pit, I spend over, you miss
Behind the back, dishing assist, haha, swish
Diana Tarasa of mines, you got to love it
Or to know the pass, and heavy d at the buzzer
Peep the high maintance MVP, who run the thing
This year you gon' bow and kiss the championship ring

[Chorus]</pre>
