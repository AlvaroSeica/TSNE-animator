[Intro]
Uhhh
Alright (Maybach Music)
{*skatting "la la-la-la"*}
I'm all grown up
(But now I'm all grown up)
Uhh, uhh, uhh
ASAP

[ASAP Rocky]
Bachelor with no tux, still got my shirt cuffed
Still got my sleeves rolled up and my shirt tucked
Grown up? Sure 'nuff, sippin on that syrup
Purple Label shit, yeah I wear what I sip
Scarface vision, see my vision's on a blimp
And a quarter ki'll turn a G into a gent
All-purpose flow, we are the great
I'm so Kurtis Blow, and these are +The Breaks+
My Christian Louboutins got nails give me hammer toes
Niggas get shy when the camera rolls
Drop crotch pants will remind you of them Hammer clothes
All yellow Phantom, I'm like Yeezy in a +Amber Rose+
"Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha," but who am I kiddin?
No way I could afford it so for now I'm just pretendin
How these gold diggers digging without a single pot to piss in?
Cause my pockets full of lint and my heart is full of vision
I'm grown

[Chrous: ASAP Rocky]
I don't do kid stuff much
Niggaz say, "Now, nigga all grown up"
I don't hear y'all much
I'm all grown up
Tough luck

[Seth Narley]
Curtains drawn, them six dudes back
The chauffeur ride in the front as we speed to the dot
Deanna waits along with the classy mist
My waist my shoulder blades the type you can't resist
Picture this: bein 21 with a gift
'Bamas don't understand how I'm strill nail swift
Or I'm M.J. nice, like Jordan up on the mic
Amen for the new saviors of rap
My birth's 3/89 but I'm 30 up on the track
That's grown man, lil' homey that's real rap
Y'all trying to switch up the style, I'm bringing Versace back
Giovanni, Medusa in all black
Hot boy, I done ran through hell and walked back
Passport is stamped, I'm sightseein the map
And to think, I'm asleep but won't blink
I'm dreamin all this within, young Leo, +Inception+
Come again? No offense
but fuck whoever said wearin slims was a trend
More like a lifestyle in the rawest form
All grown up, nuttin like before
{*piano fades out*}</pre>
