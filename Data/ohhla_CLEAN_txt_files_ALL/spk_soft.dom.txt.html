[Intro: JoJo Pellegrino]
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
What what what what what what what
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah shhhh
(speak softly)

[JoJo Pellegrino]
Well shorty decided to call my cell cus she was bored sittin home
Talkin all loud shit, got wifey pissed like "Who's on the phone?"
I told her wrong number then hung up
When I got the chance to rome I called her back
I said next time you call my jack (speak softly)
When you're somach is on the ground, you starved
And your only option is robbin cus you're too lazy to get a job
So you're masterminding the plot, and you run up in the gas station, pistol cocked
You want the cash with no problem, tell him "Your money or your life" and (speak softly)
When the boys are thirsty the block is hot and sparkin the fire
But you get your paper regardless, most of these cats rockin the wire
And just when you meet, turn on he tv and put the volume up higher
They in the van with the headphones listening so (speak softly)
Cats thats livin mob life, stabbin kids in the ribs at bar fights
Pullin the klondikes, hundred large heists, do the job nice
Shot dice on dark nights, money spinnin like cops lights
Feds raided their spot twice, I was bugged so they (speak softly)
It's funny how these dudes be runnin their mouths, talkin about the kid
Ain't got no future, no type of talent, so they bound to kid
Doubt the kid, but guess what, when they get around the kid
They know I got that fifth so the watch the lips and (speak softly)

[Chorus: JoJo Pellegrino]
Watch what you say, how you say it, and who you talk to
You never know, somethin you said come back to haunt you
Before you eat your words, observe mine, I want you
Best thing to do, bite your tongue, shhhh (speak softly)

[JoJo Pellegrino]
Yeah well mami was fiendin for some ass so she snuck me up in the crib
With her mother sleepin, steps creekin as I stumbled and slid
To the bathroom, she threw a towel on the lamp and tucked in the kid
She said "shh, we're not home, get on the floor and (speak softly)"
When I'm up at the ?peak in OCC beyond bebo and London visits"
The God see us at the desk and be all up in a brother's business
They wanna cross they arms and crack sarcastic smiles cus they critics
But we just play it off, lean over the table and (speak softly)
Stapleton's villain, faithfully illin, patient and grillin
Cater the building, kicken and chillin, ate from the ceiling
Days in the system, brother's on the wall, DA's in the building
Dust heads with the burners are able and willin so (speak softly)
Ralph and Lucy into it, cruisin a u-trip, two in the toothpick
Boomin his music, two in the full clip, usually move slick
In '86 priest do him to death with a pool and cue stick
Did ten years, came home and the avenue (speak softly)
Yo these rappers buggin, nothin but actors frontin
Stuntin like they rats is bustin, security staff be like half a dozen
Claimin the run the game, but they water it down without the flames
You ain't nice, you got fifteen minutes of fame so (speak softly)

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
