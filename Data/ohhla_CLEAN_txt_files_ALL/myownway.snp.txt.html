[Snoop Dogg]
Bank accounts, big cars
Livin good, like a movie star
My momma house, ain't in the hood no mo'
I moved her out to San Luis Obispo
But it's a trip though cause I'm a 20 Crip though
I gotta lay low, my homies wanna do low
I got two strikes, and I'ma get get my third
These niggaz snitchin on me, they think I'm sellin birds
So when I'm in the streets, I'm quick on my feet
See talk is cheap, so I stay quick on my heat
You niggaz bad? Well Dogg is badder
Rat-a-tat-ta, make you niggaz scatter
I went shotta, ya boy want me now
Went to the station that nigga straight point me out
So I'ma lay away and spray away and spree away
Cause at this time I think it's best I just stay away

[Chorus: Mr. Porter]
They say I'm a fool; cause I like to do my things my own way
I gotta couple strikes against me; one more and I'm on my way
I ain't got time to hang around the hood like I used to do
I gotta get my bread, keep my head
It's either go to jail or get this money instead

[Snoop Dogg]
Separate... elevate
Concentrate, dominate and innovate
Try to be, fly as me
And every other homey tell a lie to me
I need a deal, I need some stones
I need some beats, Dogg I need a loan
Mmm; help me out, throw me some cash
If I got you got it, and you ain't got to ask
But on the real, or is it lately?
A lot of homies, done tried to implicate me
They say I changed, is it the fame?
If I throw it to you, then charge it to the game
Money fold, overload
In the hood, another episode
Man I'm gettin old, the game cold
Yeah I'm from the Dub, but that ain't how I roll

[Chorus]</pre>
