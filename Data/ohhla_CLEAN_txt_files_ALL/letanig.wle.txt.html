Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Wale]
To be honest ain't trippin off lil change
Barely remarkable not compensative shit nigga
Bright minded, outfit short but his high sight this
Hoes open to a money talkin Shawn Claytus

[Chinx Drugs]
Grain whippin, stayin drippin nigga show the lady
Got your main bitch with me and she ain't complainin
Shorty what your aim is? Young rich and famous
Never paying for the pussy, niggaz making payments

[Wale]
Bitch I'm ballin on the court like a fuckin plaintive
NEPY?, a thrill like human nature
Ya at the bitch who cake up, ya at the bitch who wait up
I rap sure anytime, you catchin me the baker

[Chinx Drugs]
I'm from the blocks where the hustle's just to get the cake up
For the money I be shakin like Anita Baker
Chinx Drugz, I done blew up like a mine field
These niggaz better lose, aye man side deal

[Wale]
I know my mind real, I know my mind ill
Came in the lane, I made paper off the Seinfeld
Enthusiastically curb, know my rap is superb
You could close up the fact, I make racks off a pair of liquor

[Chinx Drugs]
Ayo Ralph, these niggaz actin like Jack and it's thorough
Niggaz jackin my flow, I'm just jackin they girl
Coke boy stylin on, I'm in my bathroom
Like a bad handed poker but they ass fold

[Wale]
Don't gotta worry, them horny bitches be at my show
No handouts, but my arm strong like sad smoke
Rap flow with poetry over mad songs
My stats good, I'm back slappin this stead chrome

[Hook]
[Chinx Drugs]
Where the G's at? Tell me when to go
Tell me where the cheese and I'm all about the dough
Squad like the dream team, all we rock is gold
If you really real son let a nigga know
Let a nigga know
[Wale]
Maryland or DC nigga
Let a nigga know
Don't forget the VA nigga
Let a nigga know
At the time the whole team spillin
Let a nigga know
Young king with some Queens bitches
Let a nigga know

[Chinx Drugs]
Movin on it, niggaz roll it like a locomotive
Perseverance be the key and niggaz so devoted
Fuck them haters, talkin young and get your bang up
In them clubs poppin spank on the anx hood

[Wale]
Fuck a lame man, YC my face good
Niggaz then give me brain, be a face buck
I don't I matter off it, I don't respect er often
Cause I ain't have all these broads when I was in the office
Wale us up in college, I was making sails
When they was in the world I was reading mail
Fresh up for the strip, then sent to Yale
All my niggaz afloat so now I flick the shell

[Wale]
Sell, please and sure ain't sinks
You know the type of stuntin weed who can fuck up your brinks
Some niggaz hate, some niggaz not
I make these niggaz kids to shout out just to test the flock

[Hook: x2]
[Chinx Drugs]
Where the G's at? Tell me when to go
Tell me where the cheese and I'm all about the dough
Squad like the dream team, all we rock is gold
If you really real son let a nigga know
Let a nigga know
[Wale]
Maryland or DC nigga
Let a nigga know
Don't forget the VA nigga
Let a nigga know
At the time the whole team spillin
Let a nigga know
Young king with some Queens bitches
Let a nigga know</pre>
