Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Man I venture to find
life's adventure is mine
Enter the mind of the lemon on the assembly line
With the heart of a lifesaver swimmer
When I'm pounding through the arctic it's the ice breaker skipper

Life pace depicter
Sky scraper swinger
In flight late in winter
It's that night raven singer
In a dark world with the mind-state of splinter
The light ray emitter when my mic paints the picture

Topic synergy
mixed with exotic imagery
I'm the conductor of this cosmic hypnotic symphony
So witness me, dancin in the spot brah,
The ghost in the machine
It's the phantom of this opera

Let's find the truth behind America's hit and run
As they heard me rearin' and tearin' through area 51
The ants scurry under the eye of echelon
Let's get in orbit - let's revive the renaissance
Look at history - half of it is mistold
Cause the winner writes it in this atmospheric fish globe
The grand vista - truth is the best ally
And that's the clutch point through the hoop and the net shall I
continue till were together in reality?
Look how far we've come
We're magelans of the galaxy
See the dots you connect and sew the tapestry
Then stand back from life's mosaic masterpiece

[Izm interlude]

Rebels with the hunger to win
That's why three cheeky devils just got under your skin

I'm a soldier of the sun with a gun that blows roses
Did what they said we couldn't now look who's the no hopers
We can touch god through the power of a crowd
Bush bashing with a butcher knife
how you like me now?
They call me mister magic when I handle a track
I'm from a world where the rabbit pulls the man outta hats
So come along there's nothing wrong with seeing Max on a bear's back
With a bong singing songs in his trackies and airmax

Yo they want me to leave it or love it I'd rather keep it and fuck it
Cause this reefer I'm puffin has got me deep in discussion
And nobody is as free as Eso
I spin the mind out like a BMX spoke

I was sent with a destiny to protect my own pedigree
keep this kept in your memory and I'll bet you'll remember me
This is mental telepathy
On the edge of the cemetry
Where the devil eventually has to step to my weaponry

I'm got infinite ammo
I'm like a ninja in camo
I sit in the shadows and spit like the tip of an arrow
I shoot shit with the sparrows
Until I master the pain
Pardon the flames
Carvin my name in the park when it rains
In the garden of chains
We get lost in the labrynth
Even using half of my brain
Bitch, watch what will happen
So
Do you really think your faster than my blade?
Cause I gotta liquid sword and I'ma park it in your face

Rebels with the hunger to win
That's why three cheeky devils just got under your skin</pre>
