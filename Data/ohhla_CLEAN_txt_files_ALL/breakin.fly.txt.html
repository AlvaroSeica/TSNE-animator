First Verse (Playa Fly &amp; Terror): 

(Playa Fly) 
I bring your cizourt procedures, your regulations and rules 
I bring your tickets, citations, and registrations to who? 
Fly need no limits no boundaries 
You just get from behind me 
I live the Mafia livin', lil' Tee the laws won't come find me 
Got so much love for my thugs 
And even more for my drugs 
And we ain't lovin' this law, so break the law and get buck 
I-B-N buckin' the system 
Cuz the system's a hizzoe (hoe) 
And I don't care bout no law, cuz Uncle Sam is my negro 
Your constitution's a fraud 
Your Bill of Rights is too slaw 
And since it's first amendment, freedom speech, I say "Break the law" 
I'm gone be hizigh (high) forever 
No matter who say whatever 
No peckerwoods or oreos, be stoppin' this fella 
Your prosecution's a crock! 
And us young bucks got 'em hot 
With blue troops in blue suits, they can't make us stop 
And I'll continue to rock 
In ways that I'll cut 'em raw 
And we ain't takin' violations, exhibit breakin' the law 
So break the law!!!! 

(Terror) 
Aiyyo Blackout 
Pass me the torch, I'm ready to scorch 
Bustin' out the back, of the track 
With the flamory force, we tired of your noise 
Watch the grin and the talk still in my voice 
No body in, no body hustle quick to hate on them boys 
Ain't playin' with toys, in fact y'all might bust cuz I'm bored 
You callin' the court ask me for six I laugh and you get ignored 
Murderin' Child, Pops should have been wearin' a Bra 
The way they had yo ass run, I thought you was a track star 
That's on the raw, haters I'ma pull out the grain 
What's my name? Terror down for cockin' and aim 
That's hard as me man, get yo weapon, I'ma prove he can't hang 
Break Da Law, some super slaw but this the 99 thang 
Rad Rapper, please watch me rock like O C's 
Drama I stay on Nestie, If you wanna test me 
Come to the Ave. get yo ass broke down like a Ki 
Three to the M, Taylor B, and I'm Playa Posse 
Watch me emepty 'em all out, it's all on me 
See eveyrbody got them sells for a Q P 
See Break Da Law! 

Chorus (11x) 

Second Verse (Playa Fly &amp; Gangsta Blac) 

(Playa Fly) 
T-H-I-P 
Down with E 
B-I-T, C-H 
Fly comin' with no time to waste 
Bigger and better, I'm strapped with Terror 
And skills wherever 
You Devil's need protection like a bombing shelter 
Like stormy weather 
Remove your roof, by tellin' the truth 
By year two, and your entire cowardly group 
Hey Handyman, you actually cannot stand to me 
And what's that young cocksucker name who playin' around with Tee? 
One murdering child, have your family worryin' awhile 
Drink up some Mo, and take a champagne shower in style 
And break up the slaw, while we be yellin' break the lizaw (law) 
And break up the raw, and put an empty one in my jaw 
And every lizaw that I break will be upon your back 
And yo that gang claimin' ass bitch, she just ain't talkin' bout jack 
See mane this Terror and this Playa never hated you haters 
If a Playa hate a hater that won't make me no faker 
Fly rise and shine, represent mine, so break the lizaw 
With Gangsta behind me so your cast is off 
And if fall bitches tizalk (talk) shizit (shit) 
you should be lockin' your jaw 
Cuz it's makin' me, makin' me, makin' me, makin' me break the law 
Break the law!!!!! 

(Gangsta Blac) 
Takin' the stick, and break dat stick down to bout six 
Lil' pieces n discs cause I'm that nigga that started all this 
Not takin' no fame, no need for me to state my full name 
I'm known to campaign, and known to Break the Law for some change 
I'm the roughest, toughest, Mother Fucka, that Hood Star 
From South Park for you Mother Fucka 
You can't deni that Gangsta Blac don't keep it rzaw, and 
Down to Break The Lzaw, and 
Head just to make, that's what you szaw 
Believe we platinum status, we mackin' through this game mane, and 
If we keep it real and stay focus upon this game mane 
If we can pay for it then, C Bill will have to come through 
A lesson should be deep in his dream bout this shit blew 
Yeah!, Now how ya like that
