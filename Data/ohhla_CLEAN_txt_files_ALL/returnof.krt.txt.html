"What a difference a day makes"

[Chorus: Big K.R.I.T.]
It's the Return of 4Eva hoe (hoe, hoe)
Pimp, pimp tight, pimp tight worldwide
It's the Return of 4Eva hoe (hoe, hoe)
Outer, outer space, outer space enterprise
It's the Return of 4Eva hoe (hoe, hoe)
Live, live from the, live from the underground
It's the Return of 4Eva hoe (hoe, hoe)
I'm talk-, I'm talking once upon a, once upon a time in the south

[Big K.R.I.T.]
Now it's the young K-R-I-T
Macking hoes like niggas with perms and gold teeth
Candy paint, Caddy doors, how I feel?
Gator toe fetish with diamonds against the wheel
like a pimp, never slack, never fold
Shake 'em up, break 'em and slam 'em like dominoes
on the flo', by my notes, player made
Replenishing these bitches with pimping like Gatorade
Tailor made, Super Tight, Mr. B
looking for a diva to wide receiver a dick
Touch down, out of sight, let it go
Coming out haaaard!

[Chorus]

[Big Sant]
Well it's Big Sant bitch and I'm mob-type figure
Coming down on you hoes and you pussy ass niggas
Forever international, sipping sake with my asian gal
My address is the winner's circle, you can hate me now
Hotter than my leather in the summer with the windows up
The word legend never get said 'less you mention us
My speech is mink, I want it all plus the kitchen sink
The whip white, time right, money green, pussy pink
Yeah, you can do with that? Think I'm lying
Baby chose on my pose, hoe I'm polished just to shine
Add the BluBlockers and gators and even Stevie could see
So look at me motherfucker, look at me

[Chorus]

[Big Sant]
Man I'm coming out harder than you could ever imagine
Paper stacking, breaking mics, living the fastest (yeah!)
I keep dimes on deck like a bank teller
Pimping so strong, ain't shit that I can't tell her
You ain't on my radar hoe, I can't smell ya
Can't see ya, don't know ya partner, so you ain't special
See we alumni nigga, next level
See me on top of the food chain, no pressure

[Big K.R.I.T.]
Now hold up, hold on, get with it bitch
Throw money like hot potatoes, can't wait to get rid of this
Emphasizing my emphasis, don't sleep on my lyricism
Glow like the moon and stars, shine like a billion prisms
See the vision clear as day, Randy Savage with my mouthpiece
Life coach, quite hard, lost hope, outreach
Plenty done it, but none can measure
to the bass and the treble of a motherfucking rebel

[Chorus]

"Sounds easy, doesn't it? It ain't"</pre>
