Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Bae I'd rather be that nigga that can take you through the hood
We chokin on exotic, we ain smokin on no wood
Bae I'd rather be that nigga that can take you through the hood
We chokin on exotic, we ain smokin on no wood
You say you from Atlanta shawty I'm from Baton Rouge
Wanna meet my double r show you how the Phantom do it

[Verse 1]
Bae I'd rather be that nigga that can take you through the hood
We chokin on exotic, we ain smokin on no wood
You say you from Atlanta shawty I'm from Baton Rouge
Wanna meet my double r show you how the Phantom do it
Ain't neva been to a mansion, you used to go in a room
{They treat you like a groupie chick} but you the youngin lady goon
If you wanna touch the moon my cups got codeine in it
And mines be straight mud, I po' mo' lean in it
You lookin like a woman but you feelin all drowsy
I'm thuggin all my women, none of my women I'm doggin
I'm fresh up out the shower, laced with baby powder
I love my Jacksonville chick, that girl fuck fa hours
Pineapple Phantom keep my swagger feelin groovy
A $50 bag yea I keep my keep movin
This fa street folks, and south Carolina
And Indiapolis, I keep them ratchet girls

[Chorus]
I'd rather be yo N.I.G.G.A.
So we can smoke week and sip lean all day
This is what I say:
Bae, you need a thug in ya life
Them lames ain't thuggin ya rite
Youngin rather be yo N.I.G.G.A.
So we can smoke week and sip lean all day
This is what I say:
Bae, you need a thug in ya life
Them lames ain't thuggin ya rite

[Verse 2]
I caught ya blushin and told ya you need a thug some
Them otha rappers radio niggas you need a club some
You smokin on that light green kush, I'm chokin lettuce
Put my numba in yo phone, don't call me til you ready
No don't... tell me to stop and let me freak you how I wanna
Makin love off a pint I'm a drink into a coma
New Orleans or Miami go to wherever you wanna
Get in the backseat of the phantom I'm a pu-pu-put it on ya
When I... rub on yo thighs don't mind me because I'm high
Yea I want her yea I want ha, now I wanna be inside ya
Wanna be behind ya, I wanna on side ya
Kuz them otha hoes, they ont like my fire
Hey, I need a thug in my life too
A freak, she gon give me head with that ice too
Look, and you ain't gotta be a freak
It's a thug in ya life, so welcome to street beat

[Chorus]
I'd rather be yo N.I.G.G.A.
So we can smoke week and sip lean all day
This is what I say:
Bae, you need a thug in ya life
Them lames ain't thuggin ya rite
Youngin rather be yo N.I.G.G.A.
So we can smoke week and sip lean all day
This is what I say:
Bae, you need a thug in ya life
Them lames ain't thuggin ya rite

[Verse 3]
Id rather be ya N.I. double G A
Mansion on the hill, king size we lay
Flat screens up watch what you say
Choppas on the floor watch where chi'ren play
And we can be together forever eva and eva
Get a ladder for them stairs kuz we on another level
Bae, go get a shovel and help me find my gold
Ion mean you a slut, but you a whole different hoe
I take you to the mall and you pick my Polo draws
You pick my Polo shirts, yea you pick my Polo out
Go to the bank and get some bands, you with me when I ball
When it all falls down I know who to call
But if you need a thug dick hit me up and watch I come quick
Fuck with a thug kuz them lames on that fuck shit
Yo chi'ren at home so the love at home
And you ont need a nigga there you gotta thug alone

[Chorus]
I'd rather be yo N.I.G.G.A.
So we can smoke week and sip lean all day
This is what I say:
Bae, you need a thug in ya life
Them lames ain't thuggin ya rite
Youngin rather be yo N.I.G.G.A.
So we can smoke week and sip lean all day
This is what I say:
Bae, you need a thug in ya life
Them lames ain't thuggin ya rite</pre>
