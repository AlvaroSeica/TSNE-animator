Song:   What You Talkin Bout
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro]
If you ain't talkin' money, what you talkin' 'bout?
If you ain't talkin' money, what you talkin' 'bout?
If you ain't talkin' money, what you talkin' 'bout?
Real niggaz walkin' through, better walk around

[Verse 1]
Pour a pint in the 20, all my niggaz be ridin'
Fuck around, see the news  all your niggaz be bodies
She told me her nigga comin', she gon' put me in the closet
I told her "go tell that nigga he won't see me in the closet"
And if his body a bank, shotty gon' be my deposit
We run up, they run off  who seen where they joggin'?
I get the prop and the posters, shooters gon' think it's they market
Call the trunk K-Mart, guess who gon' be their target?
No particular niggaz, tell y'all set "bye"
Burnin', my chest high, look at my left eye
I know Keisha and Nina, and my bitch like Chiquita
Cut your throat like Chiquita, suckin' off my Chiquita
We 'bout it, all my niggaz be 'bout it
Paper, pistols and pussy, all my niggaz be 'bout it
They get to sendin' the shots, all my niggaz reroute it
Sex, money and murder, all my niggaz be 'bout it

[Chorus]
If you ain't talkin' money, what you talkin' 'bout?
Real niggaz walkin' through, better walk around
Chopper hangin' out, it's got a drum on it
Niggaz talkin' stupid, we go dumb on 'em
AK check, AR check  click-clack, bang! Aimin' at his neck
AK check, AR check  click-clack, bang! Aimin' at his neck

[Verse 2]
Ridin' with my rooftop back
Light skin, tatted up  Tupac back
Rest in peace Machiavelli  macks to his belly
Swiss-cheese a nigga  turn him to spaghetti
Bunch of pussy cats, your whole team scary
Got my dogs with me, my whole team ready
Fuck all y'all, already poppin'
Got a bitch named Nina, givin' head proper
She go click-clack  headshot 'em
Stomp a nigga bloody, I've got red bottoms
Mentally insane, I've got every problem
Beef? We turn that issue to a dead problem
Cutter in the trunk, money in my pocket
They can't stop it, me and gunner takin' off like rockets
You ain't bringin' money 'round? Nigga you could move around
Surround your team with choppers singin' loud, that's surround sound

[Chorus]</pre>
