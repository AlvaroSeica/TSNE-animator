[9th Prince]
Yeah, yo, I used to roll up, this is a hold up
Niggaz fold up before I erupt
I'm the reason why 50 Cent wants to self-destruct
Crush ya luck and be sitting like a duck, with such and such
9th Prince is the ruler, old schooler
Director and producer, I rise like the steam out the sewer
And spit that ill shit that flows like manure
Recorded on camera, put it on Youtube
Killarmy in ya galaxy, that's my attitude
Niggaz wanna see me dead, misled, handcuffed by the feds
We back in armored tanks, fighting Angels and Demons like Tom Hanks
Tailor-made bulletproof tuxedos, that's how I succeed, yo
Somebody tell Ludacris he's not insane
Cut off his dreads and smack the shit out of Lil' Wayne
So, yo, Enter the Wu-Tang

[60 Second Assassin]
King of Kings, operation: killa machine
The illest regime, leave ya spleen
Somewhere, floating in the stream
(speaking in Arabic)
You need time to ween, cuz everybody else is fleeing
Hauling ass, plus they got a whiff of the blast
The Last Shall Be First
Elapsed, seed already planted in the dirt
Already in works
A new dawn sets forth the crack of the Heavens, shark in the Earths
North opens up the cloth, the arrow pointed to the East to the North
Which all ends in a fork, Benz or good thoughts, swift, cheetah shifts
Lost, can't remember shit, craft all his sources, he forfeits
Claim another business as cold as the caucus
