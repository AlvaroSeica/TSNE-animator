Song:   Sex, Drugs and Money
Typed by: ja_rule@lowrider.com

The few topics that sell in the industry
Sex, drugs and money baby
Check

[Chorus]
Now let's talk about topics that are known to sell
Like sex, drugs and money as well
With this steady cash flowing, hoes still blowing
I'ma talk about some shit that I'm knowing
For real

Still getting freaky and excited, delighted
Girl don't bite it and that shit don't fight it
Found you up on F Street dealing sex toys
Like handcuffs, lotions and things that make noise
It's all good if you like to get wild
Sixty eight and one, we can do it any style
Maybe froggy-style, let you ride for a while
Now why you busting out a smile
Now it's a fact that everybody needs sex
Like every baller needs a rolex

[Chorus]

Now next on the list, number two is drugs
Everybody uses them, not just thugs
From the chronic to the blunts, from the X to the C
Wanna know how it feels, just come and ask me
See I stay high, multiply my elevation
Intoxication is my only motivation
Across the whole nation and around the whole globe
We all get blazed but some keep it on the low
Doctor's perscription, ever wonder why
You're walking all around town legally high
Ever wonder why the one times always at the dougunt shop
Cuz they just confiscated my crop
Now it don't stop there, broke of millionare
Take another hit and you'll see them everywhere
It's a fact, it's the number one seller
Even the president was once an inhaler

[Chorus]

Now I've saved the best for last, it's gonna be the cash
Everybody screaming out, get money
It ain't funny in this land of milk and honey
Keep it on the realer, I gotta make my scrilla
It's nothing new, it makes the world go round
When you ain't got it they can keep you down
If you wanna stay on top and make the ass drop
And be like OJ and get over on the cops
Then you gotta stack knots, big faced bills
Make big deals if you wanna see mills
I know how it feels to be broke, it's no joke
Now I know how it feels to live lavish, I'm happy
That's the way it had to be
Cuz money making is the root of any industry
For real

Now they wanted me to keep it commercial
So I'ma tell you exactly what sells

[Chorus]</pre>
