[Nicki Minaj]
Doctor doctor, need you back home baby
Doctor doctor, where you at? Give me something
I need your love, I need your love, I need your lovin
You got that kind of medicine that keeps me comin
My body needs a hero, come and save me
Something tells me you know how to save me
I've been feelin weird, oh, oh I need you
to come and rescue me

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Make me come alive, come on and turn me on
Touch me, save my life, come on and turn me on
I'm too young to die, come on and turn me on!
Turn me on! Turn me on! Turn me on! Turn me on!

[Nicki Minaj]
Oh you make it, make it right
My temperature is super high
If I scream, if I cry
It's only cause I feel alive
My body needs a hero, come and save me
Something tells me you know how to save me
I've been feelin weird, oh, oh I need you
to come and rescue me

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
You've got my life in the palm of your hands
(Palm of your hands)
Come and save me now, I know you can
(I know you can)
Uhh, uh~! Da-da-da-da, don't let me die young
I just want you to father my young
I just want you to be my doctor
We could get it crackin chiropractor
I-I-I-I, I-I-I-I
I-ah-ah-I-I know you can save me, and make me feel alive

[Chorus] - 1/2</pre>
