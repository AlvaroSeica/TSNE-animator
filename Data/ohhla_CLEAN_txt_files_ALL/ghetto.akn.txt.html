Ghetto, Ghetto, Ghetto, Ghetto Livin

These streets remind me of quick sand (quick sand)
When your on it, you keep going down (goin down)
And there's no one to hold one to
And there's no one to pull you out
You keep on fallin
No one can hear you callin
So you end up self destructing
On the corner with the toolie on the waist side
Just got about the things you would stay time
Teeth marks on my back from the K-9
Dark memories of when there was no sunshine
Cause they said that I wouldn't make it
I remember like yesterday
Holdin on the one God gave me

[Chorus 2X]
Cause that's the life when your livin in the (ghetto)
And eatin in the (ghetto)
Oh sleepin in the (ghetto)
Ghetto livin

No need to cherish luxuries
Cause everything comes and goes
Even the life that you have is borrowed
Cause your not promised tomorrow
So live your life as if everyday is gonna be your last (be your last)
Once you've moved forward you can't go back just to remove your past

[Hook]
Cause you gotta be willin to pray
Yes there gotta be gotta be a better way (oh)
Yes you gotta be willin to pray
Cause there gotta be gotta be a better day
Whoever said that the struggle would stop today
A lot a niggaz dead or locked away
Teenage ones growin up with aids

[Chorus 2X]
Cause that's the life when your livin in the (ghetto)
Oh eatin in the (ghetto)
Oh sleepin in the (ghetto)
Ghetto livin

Gun shot every night in the (ghetto)
Crooked cops on side in the (ghetto)
Everyday is fight in the (ghetto)
Oh oh oh oh oh (ghetto livin)
Got kids to feed in the (ghetto)
Sellin coke and weed in the (ghetto)
Everyday somebody bleep in the (ghetto)
Oh oh oh oh oh (ghetto livin)

That's the life when you're livin in the (ghetto)
Oh livin by the (ghetto)
Oh eatin in the (ghetto)
(Ghetto livin)

That's the life when you're livin in the (ghetto)
Oh sleepin in the (ghetto)
Oh livin in the (ghetto)
Ghetto ghetto (ghetto livin)</pre>
