[Apocalipps]
Apocalipps, take it to vein like dope and needles
Watch me run through ya whole crew like bean burritos
One false mouth, ya team's finito, they hate me in London
It's all good, cuz they fiend for Beno
Truck and Iron, Pop Ya Head, toss the iron
It can go down in broad day, the four's is firing
If you need work, the block is hiring, shit
The get low, get dough, you gotta duck them sirens
And every hood around got some nice spitters
Yeah, ya'll got some heavy hitters, but we got the best pitchers
That sling all night, nigga, from summer to winter
You made a g in an hour then you pulled a no hitter
Let a right hook splatter ya jaw, stitch ya mouth close
Now what the fuck I gotta battle you for

[Iron Mic]
Aiyo, my gun is busting, my razor is cutting
Ya'll niggas is fronting, we lay you down, nigga, it's nothing
My gun is busting, my razor is cutting
Ya'll niggas is fronting, we lay you down, nigga, it's nothing
My fists is swinging, my knife is stabbing, my feet is stomping
It's Ruthless, from Staten Island to Compton
Bang like a marksmen, hit your apartment
Don't even light it up, unless it's haze or the chocolate, nigga
It's Iron, I bang for my gang, so change up your offense
Run for cover when the burner is sparking
All we trynna do is lock it down, and finish up what we started
Sign with the Wu, but soon after departed
I think they found out, what we already knew, that we was the hardest
But it don't matter, we gon' shine regardless
Cuz I'm now a partner with Pop Ya Head Off Records, plus I'm an artist
Plus I'm starving, plus my flow is retarted
Now I want you to add that, shit up, like you was in college
And realize them other rappers is garbage

[Hook 2X: Beno]
My niggas is Ruthless
My niggas, them niggas is Ruthless

[Beno]
Now, what these kids is talking about
Like the kid ain't hot, wont torch ya house
Like the ambulance wont come, and scorch you out
Right after they give ya punk ass mouth-to-mouth
Now you don't want the kid to blast the lead
Cuz if so, you gon' end up, with a plastic head
Multiple stab wounds, gash to ya head
And ya punk ass still gon' pass the bread
Cuz, if you owe, then you should know
That Beno don't play when it come to dough
So give it up, or get hit up
Ruthless, nigga, and you know we don't give a fuck

[Bless]
This nigga's smoking crack, greens or dust
I'm known to pop off with the ox, and split ya shit
And now I'm riding on the freeway in a broke up Chevy
Gun point heavy, crack stashes all in my Pelly
Ruthless is the set I claim, and I pop off
Any nigga head that wanna try and test my name
R-U-T-H, L-E-S-S
Bastardz, quick to bring it to ya chest, yes
You a new born, remember me? Blaow put ya shoes, on
Truck run 'em over with the Yukon</pre>
