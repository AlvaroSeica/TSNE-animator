[Chorus]
("All in all, the days go by, she smiles")
I'm just sayin, I'm sayin these hoes is thirsty
I'm just sayin, I'm sayin these hoes is thirsty
I'm just sayin, I'm sayin these hoes is thirsty
("All in all, the days go by, she smiles")
I'm just sayin, I'm sayin these hoes is thirsty
I'm just sayin, I'm sayin these hoes is thirsty
I'm just sayin, I'm sayin ("And then she lies")
("You can see it in her eyes, you can see it in her eyes")
("You can see it in her eyes, you can see") ("And then she lies")
("You can see it in her eyes, you can see it in her eyes")
("You can see it in her eyes, you can see")

[Rapper Big Pooh]
I met her on the humble, navigatin the jungle
of this business that I claim, a cheetah with no name
Big game hunter. makin niggaz pray for the summer
I mean.. shorty fine, but her mind picked a number
on the crazy chart, never feed the animals, enjoy the park
Every once in a while, one is crazy smart
Robert Greene say seduction is an art
I'm guessin she read the part about the charmer 
My confidence is armor, I don't need her though 
Still wanna beat it, though
Had to realize I was dealing with a professional
Letter read confessional, ignorin all advances
She throwin me the pussy, I Braylon Edwards the chances
We don't talk for a minute
Then a text comes, say "I still want you in it,
when you next come?" I can tell she really meant it
Not in a relationship, but still tryna in it - she thirsty

[Chorus]

[Chaundon]
Notice you peepin, then we started speakin
Sexual tension, what's a nigga to do?
So we started creepin, then I stopped fiendin
The very next weekend, you was lovin the crew
But hatin on me cause I was huggin my boo
She back for a guilt trip, "Did I mean nothing to you?"
Of course my response was true - a bit rash
C'mon, your fine ass was just something to do
Besides, I peep game by the look in your eyes
A sort of thirst that'll never be quenched by any guy
Reverse cowgirl, can't take me for a ride
Though we slid bareback for a couple of times, hah~!
Pulled out, I ain't fallin for the trap
Two ain't becoming three, so I ain't comin to thee
And you and me will never be we, quit reachin
You stay with a cup in your hand, it's thirst season</pre>
