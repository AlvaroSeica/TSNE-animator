Wuzzup? Wuzzup? Wuzzup homie?
Wussup? Wussup professor?
I'm chilin man, you know
Just catchin a quick break before I go back to this class, you know?
What's good? What's on yo agenda?
I got a question professor
What's that?
I wanted to know... um... I was thinking about taking your class
What's your main objective with Freestyle 102?
Well uh with Freestyle 102, what I'm basically teaching the kid is like
You know, I'm tryna teach em how to freestyle
Still make good music, why you freestyle?
Make songs and make it to uh you know
The barbershop's bumpin it, every kid comin to class with their headphones on bumpin it
I want this to be played everywhere
Look, it's going off
Now, my my my kids you know they they they they text me and all that
But uh, you know basically I wanna show people that it's a art
I wanna show em how to make it a art
While still you can make money off of it and songs that people still enjoy
You know, you master the craft so much to the point where people don't even think you're freestylin'
Which is something that I went through a lot and I'm still going through so if you wanna sign up you let me know man
Where do I sign up?
Chuu, let's go!</pre>
