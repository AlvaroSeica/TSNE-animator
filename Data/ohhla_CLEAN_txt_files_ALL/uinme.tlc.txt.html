[T-Boz]
You in me feels twice as nice
And everything we do is right
It's nasty love, but that's all right with me
Once a month is not enough
I think about it every week
There's other guys
But that's not you in me

1 - 	I can't understand why it feels so good
	I never felt this way before
	I want you more and more each day
	Even if there's someone else
	I might as well take care of myself
	I'm never satisfied like you in me

2 - 	You're so damn special, baby yeah
	I could have anybody but that's not you in me
	You're so damn special
	Don't wanna give mine up, cause I like you in me

[T-Boz]
You in me became unreal
I never hesitate to see
I need it now and that's how it should be
You in me was somethin' else
Started messin' with my mind
Cause there will never be me in you, hey, hey

Repeat 1

Repeat 2

You're so damn special
You know, you know, you know baby yeah
I could have anybody but that's not you in me
You're so damn special
Can't understand the way I feel
Don't wanna give mine up, cause I like you in me

You're so damn special baby
I could have anybody but that's not you in me
So damn special, hey, hey, hey yeah
Don't wanna give mine up cause I like you in me
So damn special, hey oh oh
I could have anybody but that's not you in me

So damn special, hey yeah, hey yeah
Don't wanna give mine up cause I like you in me
So damn special, baby
So damn special
I could have anybody but that's not you in me
So damn special, baby hey
Don't wanna give mine up cause I like you in me</pre>
