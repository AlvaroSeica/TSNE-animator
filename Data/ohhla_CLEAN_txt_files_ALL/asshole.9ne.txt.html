(Intro: Tech N9ne)
A.S.S.H.O.L.E.
The word is mainly used as a profanity towards someone the speaker does not like
Whose behavior is hurtful, self-centered, or particularly abrasive.
 
(Verse 1: Tech N9ne)
MCs come around me talkin' bout, "your stage show is off the hook" 
As i'm walkin' out
As if to say my performance is why they gawkin'
Outside that i'd be lost in doubt the lyrics that a nigga be tossin' out
You muh'fuckas can't see Tech
I mean be Tech 
And these rejects lyricly don't got no electricity
We that quickily
Eject when your shit inside the cd deck
We just put in the dope shit we rep
Then we jet i mean split like a V-neck nigga 
Nigga thats disrespectful
Never test the next bro
When he up the air like Craig Smith, Tech and Nesto
Standin' next to Necro 
We blessed to let flow 
Get dough
Even though you know we gets the pest-o
Kalli say that it's a compliment
When they say they love the show 
But you knw I spit that monsta shit
All you mediocor rap mothafuckas tryin' spit
Ill murder yours ya im an asshole when its time to shit, nigga
 
(Hook: Tech N9ne)
You can label me a Asshole
Cause i'm fast burn your ass on blast i'm a natural
Call me ??? 
Little stinka
You ain't touchin' me in this arena (NOOO)
You can label me a Asshole
Cause i'm fast burn your ass on blast i'm a natural
Little ???
Don't make toot toot 
You don't wanna make me have to show proof (NOOOOO)
 
(Verse 2: Big Scoob)
Let me at 'um
Nigga line 'em up
I smell pussy
These niggas funny 
Nigga bout the rappin' they be steady  wolfin'
They barely eatin'
BUt believe they can see me eithins
Or be my hiethins
Best believin' it's gona end with squezin'
I'm not a rap cat
Could give a fuck about your vicious flows
Big homie stay strap with the force so i got heat to blow
But i don't freestyle and waste ryhmes like half of ya
I'm still spectacula
It's just a different vinacula
I'm disrespectful i can give a fuck bout your hip hop
I'm tryin to eat you niggas meat
I'm comin for your spot 
Fresh up off the block
And i won't stop untill i reach the top
I'm Killa City's B.I.G. i'm guessin' Ninas Pac
Damn right nigga quaoted and unquaotable
Any problems we can solve them nigga let me know
We the new niggas Strange Music takin' over
And there ain't nan nigga safe, even Hova
 
(Hook)
 
(Verse 3: Krizz Kaliko)
Asshola me yo
I'm super sick and sodomize ya right
My bad attitude will be my demise
Don't look me directly off in my eyes
I might get insecure bout what you staren bout
Rip you fuckin hair right out
Mr. Nice Guy i might seem when you meet me
But niggas might die if i'm deeming your speach beefy
Kiss em bye bye if he ain't speedy to leave me
Had to nighty nighty em cause a nigga seemed sleepy (What an asshole)
The world did it to me
Staren at my face like it's playing a movie
Twist my lip off and my lip off 
Not polite time so that means im soft?
You think i'm chicken i think you bitch is the dippin sauce
All i got is hard dick and bubble gum
Can't give ya neither one 
Your bitch is too troublesome
Yeah id like  to sign my name on your poster
But don't slip me your demo it's gona end up as a coaster
I'm an ASSHOLE
