[Intro]
Busta ass nigga (busta ass niggas). Bitch ride on they ass
I be back in about 30 minutes. Get your ass in the car nigga

[Kurupt]
Before I even step motherfuckers hit the deck
I get's wreck with a tech so cash in like checks fool
I fet's my own back in a strap
But if it calls for that I got my nigga Kenny Mack (beeoitch)
Swift as the wind the Mac 10 is in my niggas clutches
So bust this we rush this punk ass nigga
I knew he was a fuckin' punk
So then I tapped Daz "go and pop the fuckin' truck"
He steps back in with tech and I'm all puffin' on blunts 
Ready to get wrecked
Even though I knew he had a Mac 10 on I gave a fuck
And stuck the tech out the window ready to (let loose)
Get (some gin and juice) and then tell Snoop to come scoop
Check me out peep how all who withstand
Step so quick and slowly sink like quicksand
"Murder" that's what I be yellin' 
I'm peepin' ya people now two       hoods the villian
Wheather I'm a see a G or a B.G. 
Sportin' locs and a beenie tryin' to mad dog you can't see me
Now I can bust a cap and split 'em up 
Or ready to get 'em up 
What's up with that Dogg Pound? Like nigga then I hit 'em up
Now you know what's up with Kurupt (right)
Niggas don't give a fuck I'm headed for the westside

[Snoop]
Now this spots owned by the motherfuckin' D.O. (double G)
P.O.U.N.D. so I see no (other choice) but to roll with the homicide
(For all this drama make you and your momma die)

[Hook]
This is Dogg Pound for life
This is Dogg Pound for life (nigga I just don't give a fuck)
This is Dogg Pound for life
This is Dogg Pound for life (nigga we just don't give a shit)

[Daz Dillinger]
now before I bail, as I raise up a few sags
fresh the zig-zag rap and grapped my cavy sack
tote a strap in my lap because the fueds is on
one of these niggas got caught slippin'
now the Eastside, the war zone
now, for the Old G's, the old G's at all C's
sellin' Cavy on the spots, late nights
who gives a fuck about the other nigga, just Tha Pound for life
I got the beat, bangs, rocks on many blocks
sellin' my nuts like crazy at the sales, never stop
"I sow my paper stackin' so I have to rush me a B and shit"
"I live the life that I live"
yeah, bust greatest of them all "a hustler"
I play my game like the gangster had no love from no buster
it musta been like the dream
I moved from Saggs to Queens, from Oz's to ki's
now I'm known through the hood as the O.G.
never known no more cavy car, no B.G.
I put this sag down, I put my bang down, I start to set trip "why"
cause this is Dogg Pound
so now you know about that nigga D.A.Z "where you from"
Eastside till I dizzie, L.B.C..........

[Hook: Snoop Doggy Dogg]
This is Dogg Pound for life
This is Dogg Pound for life (nigga I just don't give a fuck)
This is Dogg Pound for life
This is Dogg Pound for life (mothafucker I just don't give a shit)
This is Dogg Pound for life
This is Dogg Pound for life (call it what you want, Dogghouse the Game)
This is Dogg Pound for life
This is Dogg Pound for life (nigga we just don't give a shit)

[Snoop Doggy Dogg]
Bitch, meditate to my flow, as I mob down the 'Row
yo, boy it's a G with the blast degree
187 ain't shit but a mess to me
I've seen a lot of niggas "come up" a few niggas "done up"
some rest in peace with the Khakis that be trip for this
but it's the Eastside gunnin, a who-ride thang
if we bang to the boogie then we boogie to the bang
I bring you the mothafuckin' .38
just get the emcee and my homey Nate
so we can ride, glide, dippin' and slide
as I take you on a trip, make a ride, Eastside...

[Hook: Snoop Doggy Dogg]
This is Dogg Pound for life
This is Dogg Pound for life (nigga we still don't give a shit)
This is Dogg Pound for life
This is Dogg Pound for life (mothafucker we still don't give a shit)

[Outro: Daz Dillinger]
no where to hide nigga, well you can't boy
there's no way to scape, there's no way you, can't scape
so pass this piece bitch, you're ridin' with some killers
