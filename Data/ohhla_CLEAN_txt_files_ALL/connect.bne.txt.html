(Chorus)x2
We Creep, creep, creep, and we crawl,crawl
Crawl, ballin' on all of y'all
Niggas heavy in the game
And we connectin' the plots, and we connectin' the plots

(W.C.)
Move back homie as I pump my Chevy up
Mash and hit the gas
Fly my bandana up outta the window
And left her ass on the smash
Maniac mission, dippin', sqrew-job intermission you're bangin' for mine
From the west to the east to the nine, nine
Bow down bustas ain't no bannin' me
Now I'm back, and I'ma walk on with Layzie and the Mo Thug family
Dub-C, C-Dub rippin', trippin', click, click
I loaded the clip in with my eighty gauge
Twistin', got you bitch niggas ticked
And move and walk up outta the kitchen
Conect-gang and Mo Thugs, some real nigga collision
Rollin' 'til the wheels fall off pullin' my penis
Throwin' up the dub so much that I got atheritis in my fingers
Ride and rhyme, and get her high with illegal ???? bread
Y'all niggas don't want no parts of the ghetto heisman
With them thangs in the dash
Nigga, we bang for the cash
Steadily aimin' for that ass
Burnin' them thangs when I blast, nigga!

(Chorus)x2
We Creep, creep, creep, and we crawl,crawl
Crawl, ballin' on all of y'all
Niggas heavy in the game
And we connectin' the plots, and we connectin' the plots

(L-Burna)
You see the connection when I be flexin'
Nigga, better move in the other direction
Choose your weapon and make a selection
Cause nigga we runnin' you outta your section
Ain't no question who it be, little Layzie Bone and Dub-C
Nigga, we ride with the gangsta gangsta
Niggas, Cube and Eazy-E, E
Better pump your fist and throw them dubs 'til they reach the sky
Puttin' it down 'til the day I die
You know I take a eye for a eye
Smokin' a lot to keep my mind steady
You niggas ain't ready for what I be bringin'
And ain't none of my crimes petty
So nigga don't test me
On the westsides I rides in a lo-lo dippin' them corners
From the double glock to Watts
This shit don't stop in Killafornia
Nigga I'm a world wide baller call me the international thug
Makin' it happen, so nigga now what?
Nigga, you know it's nothin' but love
But this game that we play in it's money, murder and mayhem
We got rules and we gotta obey them
Got dues and we gots to pay them
Say them niggas up the block disrespectin' your spot
Hit 'em up with a Tech and glock
Cause nigga we connectin' the plots

(Chorus)x2
We Creep, creep, creep, and we crawl,crawl
Crawl, ballin' on all of y'all
Niggas heavy in the game
And we connectin' the plots, and we connectin' the plots

(W.C.)
Callin' on them bangers, I'm gonna creep through all you haters
No matter what your thinkin'
Me and Layzie runnin' the game and off the chain, and swangin'
I come ready to blast
Clickin' my pumps smackin' New Jack's ass
Clippin' doin' leanest, my lol-low's the cleanest
There's no crystile just to toss canibal be legit to brain
And, I's jaded, the most hated
I can't be faded
Dub-C and Layzie Bone, the greatest niggas y'all

(Layzie)
Burna and Dub, you see
Ain't none of you fake niggas gon' trouble me
You catch me in this century
Gettin' blueback off that bubbly
We them street mothafuckas who got some big mothafuckas
Playin' for keeps mothafuckas
Bringin' the heat to you mothafuckas
Breakin' y'all team mothafuckas
Everytime we speak to y'all cowards
Wettin' you niggas down like showers competition get devoured
Sendin' flowers to your mama, bringin' the drama be the shit
Bringin' that thugsta, thugsta, thugsta, thugsta, gangsta shit

(Chorus)x2
We Creep, creep, creep, and we crawl,crawl
Crawl, ballin' on all of y'all
Niggas heavy in the game
And we connectin' the plots, and we connectin' the plots

We aint holdin shit back
Thug Bu Nature
L-burn, Dub-C ghetto high
Rollin with the ghetto high
Y'all niggaz aint ready for this

(Chorus)x2
We Creep, creep, creep, and we crawl,crawl
Crawl, ballin' on all of y'all
Niggas heavy in the game
And we connectin' the plots, and we connectin' the plots

Shut this niggas down
Everytime y'all cant fuck with big my brother Dub-C (bitch)
L-Burn y'all, L-Burn y'all, Thug By Nature
Y'all know what time it is
Yeah, nigga </pre>
