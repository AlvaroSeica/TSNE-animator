[Verse 1: Urthboy]
Oh my God you were excitement on legs
and everything you said gave me an incitement to beg
I don't claim to be no expert but I like what I've read
Was just tryn'a get your attention, not get you in bed
We'd hide in your dorm room, you were easy to talk to
You led me on a boulevard only a spider could walk through
For 36 hours thought I'd uncovered a fortune
The truth is saw nothing else but a warped view
I touched you, escort you, caught you in old hands
and you were joking of how I'd be as an old man
My pulse is racing shaking up my cold hands
Good Christian kids behaving like adults can 
But it was more than that I had to ask you for your number
This could be an endless summer, thats the spell I'm under
Didn't get it even as I bid you were due
With an ache from something I couldn't pursue

[Chorus: Vocals Mia Dyson] {x3}
Oh baby, it was over before it began
Was over before it began
Was over before it was started, we parted you walked home

[Verse 2: Urthboy]
He smiled timidly and that'd been it or you'd hook me in
Telling like that awkward split second that I looked at him
He shook my hand, I shook with him
Barely hadn't even met him
I wanted to let him occupy my time settings
We sat for hours talking on the rollaway
Flirted how I only knew, laughed at how you'd look like at an older age
It was a golden day and a heart filled night to last a summer
I had to laugh it off but after you would ask my number
See we won't be going back in seperate cars
This will never last, always love you my regretful epitaph
I longed to tell him that I meant what I said
When we emptied out it all, all the stuff in our heads
And met up when we touched as well was flustered as hell
Tempted by the same reason I can't trust in myself
Yeh I bit my lip and waved goodbye, the phone rang
Oh fuck - it was my boy on the line

[Chorus: Mia Dyson] {x3}

[Instrumental break]

[Mia Dyson]
Was over before it began
Was over before it began
Was over before it was started, we parted you walked home
And walked home</pre>
