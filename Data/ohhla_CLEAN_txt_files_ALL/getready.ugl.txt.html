"Building is you ready because we gonna tear you down."

[Andy Cooper]
Yeah, uh-huh, here we go
7, 6, we came to rock steady
5, 4, let's start the show
3, 2, it's about to get heavy
1, you better be ready, here we go

Light the fuse I'm about to burn
And I'll tear down the building without concern
My flow is fat like the world almanac
So just follow a cat that's all of that (You know?)
I'm hip hop like Slick Rick's eye patch
Rip tracks that pump like a triple bypass
And it's a gas movin butts, makin hands clap
When the jam's jam packed fans get ransacked
On the road to get a nickel and dime cloned
Watching other groups fall of like a pine cone
Leavin their mind blown, how can it be
that Ugly Duckling works while you play for free
I formulate rhymes in my "Dexter's Lab"
And then grab the microphone, making hecklers mad
Cause, yo, they're just a butter knife, I'm a machete
Cutting to the chase, get ready

[Chorus: Andy Cooper]
Get ready
Are you ready
You better get ready
Cause here it comes
Come on! (Gotta get ready!)
Come on! (Gotta get ready!)
Come on! (Gotta get ready!)
Come on! (Gotta get ready!)
7, 6, we came to rock steady
5, 4, let's start the show
3, 2, it's about to get heavy
1, you better be ready, here we go!

[Dizzy Dustin] + (Andy Cooper)
Ugly Duckling's got 'em jumping like a trampoline
Heads bumpin like falling off a mattress spring
I never played the trumpet or the tambourine (Nope)
Dizzy puts the jam in your jamboree
I like my chips dipped in sour cream (That's right)
I like my chick's hips in a pair of jeans (Okay)
When I'm on the scene I'm every fat chick's dream
I got a match stick for your gasoline
I paint a perfect picture like I was Van Gogh (Yup)
Walking on a cloud, you can call me Lando
Hollywood Shuffle with my man Rambro
But I'm always starring like Marlon Brando
I bury fresh like Rick Rubin did Def
Then dodge the right blow, assuming he's left
I'm free fallin, breakin hearts like Tom Petty
Here's a new song, get ready

[Chorus: Andy Cooper]
Get ready
Are you ready
You better get ready
Cause here it comes
Come on! (Gotta get ready!)
Come on! (Gotta get ready!)
Come on! (Gotta get ready!)
Come on! (Gotta get ready!)
7, 6, we came to rock steady
5, 4, let's start the show
3, 2, it's about to get heavy
1, you better be ready, here we go!

[Andy Cooper] + (Dizzy Dustin)
DJ Format's in the house
(My man Greenpeace)
DJ Yoda, the whole Fat Lace Crew
(You can't forget about 70/80)
And I'll tell you who we definitely can't forget about
(Who's that?) The whole U.K., that's right

[Grand Puba]
Yeah..
Sound good right there
Oh (*shit*), that's that flow 
Stack that (*GASP*) 
Get that dough, ?
Tell 'em who the (*fuck*) we be
The Ugly D with that nigga Grand P</pre>
