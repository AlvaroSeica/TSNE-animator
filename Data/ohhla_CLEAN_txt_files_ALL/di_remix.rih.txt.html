[Verse One: Kanye West]
We the cause of all the commotion, your mouth runnin but where is you goin?
What is you smokin man that ain't impo'tant?! What is you talkin man that ain't impo'tant?!
Illuminati?! High society?!
We in this party and nobody invited me!
We goin crazy I don't always use my best sense
But it don't matter 'cause I stay on my Fresh Prince
Maxin, relaxin, shootin some pool and
Playin some b-ball outside of the school and
Girls with they top off outside of the pool and
Whips with the drop off outside of the Louis
You just look stupid to be ignorin the delorean
Parked in front of Armani Emporio
And, parties at Richie's is gettin risky!
Victoria's Secret shorty missed me
Voices in my head I need choices in my bed
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!! Get out my fuckin head!
It's just me and my bad bitch
Uh! So you could say I'm on my Brad Pitt! Now!
Back to the la familia I'm aligned with
Before I betray them I slit my wrist
At the top it's just us niggas! 
'Cause I don't really trust niggas!
And we made it through the hurricane
Still celebratin like a Mary Jane
We 'gon make it that's on e'rythang
Truest girls get half naked, ev'ry spring
They sayin hey Kanye!
We need you to go deeper than Tay Zonday
'Cause my verses got pain, chocolate range
So many lines you photograph it and may arm break
WOO! On the radio man I miss myself
I need to, just step back and kiss myself!
Baby! Just step up and kiss the belt
A little lower, that's what's up!
Somebody pour her, another cup
Is it too much to ask to keep your diamonds up?!
I swear until my time is up
My style sex in the shower, fresh as fuck!

[Chorus: Rihanna]
So shine bright, tonight, you and I
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye, so alive
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Shine bright like a diamond (WHOA OHHHHHHHH!!!!!)
Shine bright like a diamond (WHOA OHHHHHHHH!!!!!)
Shinin bright like a diamond (We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky)
Shine bright like a diamond (WHOA OHHHHHHHH!!!!!)
Shine bright like a diamond (WHOA OHHHHHHHH!!!!!)
Shinin bright like a diamond (We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky)

[Verse Two: Rihanna]
Palms rise to the universe, as we, moonshine and molly
Feel the warmth we'll never die, we're like diamonds in the sky
You're a shooting star I see a vision of ecstacy
When you hold me, I'm alive, we're like diamonds in the sky
I knew that we become one right away, oh right away
At first sight I felt the energy of sun rays
I saw the light beside you!

[Chorus: Rihanna]
So shine bright, tonight, you and I
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye, so alive
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Shine bright like a diamond (WHOA OHHHHHHHH!!!!!)
Shine bright like a diamond (WHOA OHHHHHHHH!!!!!)
Shinin bright like a diamond (We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky)
Shine bright like a diamond (WHOA OHHHHHHHH!!!!!)
Shine bright like a diamond (WHOA OHHHHHHHH!!!!!)
Shinin bright like a diamond (We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky)

[Bridge: Rihanna]
Shine bright like a diamond, shine bright like a diamond, shine bright like a diamond

[Chorus: Rihanna]
So shine bright, tonight, you and I
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye, so alive
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Shine bright like a diamond (WHOA OHHHHHHHH!!!!!)
Shine bright like a diamond (WHOA OHHHHHHHH!!!!!)
Shinin bright like a diamond!!!! OHHHH YEEEEEAHHHHHHHHH!!!
Shine bright like a diamond (WHOA OHHHHHHHH!!!!!)
Shine bright like a diamond (WHOA OHHHHHHHH!!!!!)
Shinin bright like a diamond (Shine bright like a diamond)</pre>
