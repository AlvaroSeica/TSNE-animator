"Kid from the ghetto, kiddie from the city"	--&gt; E Double

[Ed O.G.]
Now growin up as a kid in the ghetto
There wasn't no horses, no lake or no meadow
And I bet you'll find it hard for you to settle
In the house I was Edward, on the streets my name was Edo
My pops passed fast when I was just about 8
All of my success is to my mother, god bless her and thanks
For raisin me the right way without the help of my dad
All of the role models I had today are in the rehab
As I got older I got bolder
My hands got bigger and now it's time for me to hold a
.38 or any kind of gun
And just wait for a sucker to start some
I'm in my freshman year in a gang actin naughty
Me and Brett was rollin ball for his older brother Donnie
But both of us were scared so we gave it to Little Jay
Because he kept on sayin that ( ? ) pumped around his way
But at that time I thought the shit was cool
We used to ( ? ) every day after school
And get drunk at nights and go start more fights
If it was wrong then we did it, we couldn't do nothin right
Now I'm still in the gang, I think my posse's no joke
Until our first gang fight, then everybody broke
Except for five of us, it's a wonder we survived the rush
Cause we was outnumbered so we had to think fast
We did the sensible thing, and that was to haul ass
Now I'm out of the gang, but ain't nothin changed
Sometimes I walk around the way and everything's still the same
Except for Easter, me, Glen and Little James
Met up with the posse and it felt kinda strange
Because everyone was mad, cryin, no laughin
And then I said, "What's up yo, tell me what happened?"
Then someobdy said, "Lee's dead," I'm thinkin
Damn, no way, I seen him earlier today
Now that's fucked up, and in my body rage struck up
And I was with it to get the niggaz who did it
But we didn't make a move that night to go ill
And that's when I seriously said it's time to chill
I don't have no enemies but some of the people might not like me
But that's not a reason for you to wanna fight me
But that's the way it is, and that's word to the Edo
Cause that's the life of a kid in the ghetto

"Kid from the ghetto, kiddie from the city"
