Chorus: repeat 2X

Don't be mad
Cause yo nigga wanna ride wit me
Pimp in my caddy inside of me
Neva want him mackin to the third degree
Don't be mad
P-I-impim nation wide
Niggaz on ly left got my girls to the right
Betta have my mony or it's on tonight
Don't be mad

[Passion]
I'm that bitch yo nigga
you dream about
Got the title the car with the keys to your house
Cuase I neva let em know
Revenue's rollin in by the minute
Playboy's fightin to be all up in it, spinnin, wishin, 
That I could be the hoe but I'm all about pimpin
Bogus with that game I spill
bad azz bitch from tha hood to the real
Numba 1 to the 10 and I thought ya knew
If you wanna roll here's wat ya do
make my money, bring it home
Ask no questions, have no wants
I'm so real

Chorus

[Passion]
Now dem hoes wanna hate, and that's fine wit me
But rememba one thing, that if he wanted you that's where he'd be
I done look like a fish, from the shit that I spit, 
YEA I just can't help it
But you can take him back like a refund, 
cause I can't use what I don't want
Like DVD yo body wants me but I don't want what I don't need
I'm the big dog that's runnin things
Bitches wanna be me and niggaz can't hang
Born and raised in the bay
Oakland Cali-forn-I-A

Chorus

[Passion]
Why you wanna beat me you know you can't see me
Pimpin ain't easy, and game ain't free
I'm a pro hitta, a nigga go getta
I'm down for whateva, but I'm all about my chedda
