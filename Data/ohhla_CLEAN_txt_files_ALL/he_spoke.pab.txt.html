[Petey] So sweet so sweet

[Chorus: Petey Pablo]
When he spoke to me, he spoke to me (so sweet so sweet, yeah)
Just the sound of his voice (so sweet so sweet)
And he spoke to me, he spoke to me (so sweet so sweet, yeah)
Sound of his voice (so sweet so sweet)
Send a chill through my body (so sweet so sweet, yeah)
And I was lifted (so sweet so sweet)

[Petey Pablo]
I tried (tried) to deny (deny) the ways I was feelin
Cause the world had me all messed up, controllin my decisions
Had me at the point, where I hated who I was
Somethin had a hold on me, and wouldn't budge y'all
I felt myself sinkin, into the soul
Now all I could say, was "Help me Lord!"
And by God it hurt, I know it hurt because

[Chorus]

[Petey Pablo]
Shhhhh, wait a minute
Just when I thought it was over!
Shhhhh, wait a minute
And I was 'bout to throw in the towel (uh-huh)
My heart was heavy (uh-huh)
But the bird ain't bein a bird in the world and not bein able to fly
My heart was heavy (so heavy, so heavy)
And if you don't know what I'm talkin 'bout you must be crazy
(You need to stand up, stand up, stand up, stand up, stand up, stand up)
Good as God been to us! (Ain't that the truth)
You better stand up, stand up, stand up, stand up

[Chorus]

[Petey Pablo]
I just wanna say
Thank you - for everything {*4X*}
Every little thing (every every every every)
For every little thing (every every every every every every)
I just wanna say
Thank you - I said thank you {*4X*}
Everything you've done for me (everything you done for me)
Everything, everything, thank you (thank you)
Thank you - I said thank you {*3X*}
Wanna say thank you (thank you)
Thank you (thank you) everything you been to me
So wonderful (wonderful wonderful wonderful wonderful)
So merciful (merciful merciful merciful merciful) SO!
I said thank ya {*4X*}

[Chorus] Â– repeat 2X</pre>
