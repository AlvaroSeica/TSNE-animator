Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Intro]
Ay! ay! Teach me how to dougie (ay!)

[Verse 1]
They be like Smoove (what?) "Can you teach me how to Dougie?"
You know why? Cause all the bitches love me (ay!)
All I need is a beat that's super bumpin
And for you, you, and you to back it up and dump it (get it)
Put your arms out front, lean side to side
They gon' be on you when they see you hit that Dougie right
Ain't nobody fuckin wit my bro from Morningside
He go by Bubba and he hit that dance like thunder (okay)
I ain't from Dallas but I D-Town boogie
I show my moves off now e'rybody tryin to do me (they jockin)
I leave the functions and all the ladies tryin to screw me
Now you just do you, and I'ma do me (all day)
Niggaz love to hate, so they try to screw me
Bitches be stuck to me, I think they try to glue me
I make the party shine bright when it started boomin
This beat was bubblegum, so I had to chew it

[Chorus 2X] + (female)
(Teach me how to Dougie, teach me-teach me how to Dougie)
(Teach me how to Dougie, teach me-teach me how to Dougie)
All my bitches love me, all my-all my bitches love me
All my bitches love me, you ain't fuckin wit my Dougie

[Verse 2]
The name is Young (yup) for them dudes who don't know me (ha ha)
I know I'm from the West but I can teach you how to Dougie (yessir)
I step up in the club and, all these bitches bug me (who you?)
On a nigga dancin, and none of them know me (ha ha)
I hear this crowd screamin like "Aye get it Brodie!"
So I'm on my shoulders and I take it real low
They like, "How he do that? He can Dougie on the flo'"
And when that nigga stop they like, "Dougie some mo'!"
I'm like, "a nigga kinda tired" then I pass it to the bro
M-Bone! Show these cats how to do dat
Down South dance that we learned a lil' too fast
And brought it to the hood and, got the whole crew ask

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Back of the party, I don't really like to boogie
I'm just tryin to get bent and meet a thick redbone (hmm)
She do her Dougie and all them bitched hatin
But I'm 'bout to act a skateboard a bitch and head home (fuck you)
She got her friend so, it's a two man and
I run it, run it even if her legs long (yup)
She like "You hubby," I think she love me but
I change the subject and I do my Dougie
Cause I don't give a fuck, blow trees, get money
Me, Smoove, Heff' in the back with Playboy bunnies
We gon' make 'em to the Dougie in the middle of the bed
And when I asked for some head the bitch looked at me funny
DAHHH, bitch you can't tell me nothin
Starr made the beat, I just took it out the oven
I just see the Dougie when everybody clubbin
And I hate skinny jeans cause the burner keep rubbin (oh!)
