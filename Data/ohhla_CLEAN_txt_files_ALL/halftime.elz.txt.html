[Intro]
Check me out y'all! It's Elzhi in ya area! 'Bout to back slap and bury ya!
Check!

[Verse One]
Now let me show you how I blaze it with niggas in amazement
Always spit, shit trickier, than the maze get 
Everything I drop raw cut you like chopped saw
You should stop like when a cop draw before he pop y'all
You get your Ford crushed, actin out of sorts and don't support us
You must snort dust ridin the short bus
'Cause I'm the animal scratched that I'm the manual
Pull out swingin the metal like mechanics do
Move me soon as the crew click I'll prove that you need improvements
Since, I'm so smooth at whatever I maneuve with
And I ain't braggin player, you get your spot got
What I drop is hotter than a dragon slayer
It's only right you should show me light, because the floor be tight
I wouldn't slip on a snowy night
I'm vexed now, who should I rob next new schooler or old timer
Like a Timex, simple minded with a complex
My plan destruct the canvas, I keep promoters
Scratchin their name out, tearin up their banners
When I write see God's flare again
The bars bury than the song 'cause by the strong it's barbarian
Far scary than the omen, chicks give me dome 
In my home while I'm sittin spittin chrome watch her croonin
It's for, my real heads and paragraph addicts
I'll kill the air, compare it to asthmatics
Yeah! It's like that! You know it's like that!
I'm who you internet haters wanna strike at!
Don't make me show up to your porch with a spiked bat!
And leave you frontin with tires on your bike flat
Defeatin killed the leachers 'til you think it's sweet until I cut you off
And leave you in the cold like you have a pager eat a bill
Fuck you squad and your street appeal!
Eat a dills nick clit feet until my kicks is in your leader's grill
For real!!!

[Outro]
It's Halftime!  It's Halftime!  It's Halftime!  It's Halftime!   </pre>
