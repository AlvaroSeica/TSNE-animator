Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
Wake up in the Morning
And I count the paper
Tell the m other niggaz
Better get there weigh up
I'm in the club balling
I ain't talking lay-ups
Bitches asking why we do it so major
That's why they hate [x5]
Man fuck them haters
That's why they hate [x5]

Hold up
I don't need no introduction
Ya'll already know my name yo
All I know is trill niggaz
I don't fuck with lame hoes
Smoking on the pine tree
Me and my little dime peice
B-balling in the club
I wish a nigga check my I.D
Say with my dogs
And I ain't talking scooby
Hoes choosing
And they wanna do me
Pop the fly out yup let them out [?]
Beetter get your ass carried out
Like red bones, I like dark skin
I like girls who like girls to
When my system lock
And shad the block
Two 28s in my old school
Tatted up, white t
Pockets full of cash
I am so hot I think I just found snoops stash
6 g on a run way
Magic city on a monday
From O-hi to 305
Bow wezzy and gunplay

Wake up in the Morning
And I count the paper
Tell the m other niggaz
Better get there weigh up
I'm in the club balling
I ain't talking lay-ups
Bitches asking why we do it so major
That's why they hate [x5]
Man fuck them haters
That's why they hate [x5]

[Gunplay]
Black magic chrome things
Fresh spray I'm out of here
No miles new leather
Stunting for my audience
Putting on big time
But that ain't really shit tho
You can throw it in the club
But but that ain't really rich though
Ain't that bout a bitch though
Can't buy swag like this though
A white girl on white girl
That's what I call a disco
I'm all about that big dough
Her mouth all about that get low
I gave that ho a double douse
She throwing back trying to get mo
Quit asking who my jewler and
If I know slick rick the ruler
I'm gunplay don logan
Fuck it call me don shooter
I'll snap her like a barracuda
I'll beat it up
I tattooed it
I pick her up
I knock it down
Then keep that cadillac moving

[Chorus]
Wake up in the Morning
And I count the paper
Tell the m other niggaz
Better get there weigh up
I'm in the club balling
I ain't talking lay-ups
Bitches asking why we do it so major
That's why they hate [x5]
Man fuck them haters
That's why they hate [x5]

[Bow Wow]
Maybach music cash money
All we get is fast money
Stunt big, ride tall, shitting on all of ya'll
Shout out to my team, always on my grind
Spent 200 on my rolly
Back up bitch, cause u don't know me
Blowing on that purp, but we smoking on that hydro
Don't fuck with no [?]
Cause that don't get my eyes close
Shout out to the crib, columbus in this bitch
While you blogging leaving comments, I'm steady getting rich

[Chorus]
Wake up in the Morning
And I count the paper
Tell the m other niggaz
Better get there weigh up
I'm in the club balling
I ain't talking lay-ups
Bitches asking why we do it so major
That's why they hate [x5]
Man fuck them haters
That's why they hate [x5]</pre>
