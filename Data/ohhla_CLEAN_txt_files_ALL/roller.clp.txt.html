[Pusha T]
Uh, yea they call me Pusha, uh, Draper Inc., Star Trak
What you know about this pink on wrist
Je-sus flush like je-sus sick
Same color glow through the crucifix
Pa-vay pink like white girl clit
Might not cook if you ain't used to shit
But see me I'm used to rich
Livin' this two-door life coupes all white
The SL like a swiss army knife
Tuck away the roof shed some light
Fold it back out if you keeps it right
Hold the tech close day turn to nights
Cause niggaz hate to see you with phenom lights
Rims on gleam, techs on beam
Three times dope got hex on fiends
Look through the hood checks on lean
Pusha bounce weight like trampolines nigga

[Chorus/Clipse]
I don't mean to brag
I don't mean to boast, but
Baby I'm A Roller
Now move them things up and down the coast
Like daddy showed ya'
Keep heat close on the waist Fa-SHO
Always been a soldier
Hoes and money that's all I know

[Miles]
Listen up boys and girls, ladies and gentlemen
Whatever side of the world or hood you livin' in
It's Miles back in this bitch
I come through stackin' my chips
You show me ten broads I'm bodyin' all ten of um'
Sweet brown cinnamon even hot chocolate
Let me kick that once I go non-stop in it
Back in the place to be and
Guess what I got on my waist with me
It's the 4-5th of the clip we roll thicker
Than your homey's on the corner who pourin' that malt liqour
Sicker than sick I'm flippin' a switch
Im inventin' a feelin' of venomous spit I been in this bitch uh
Girls, broads, boppers females
Rims blades choppin' spree-well's
Draper Inc. records we sell
With the Clipse offically Big boy shells...

[Chorus/Clipse]
I don't mean to brag
I don't mean to boast, but
Baby I'm A Roller
Now move them things up and down the coast
Like daddy showed ya'
Keep heat close on the waist Fa-SHO
Always been a soldier
Hoes and money that's all I know

[Malice]
Center of attention my back to the ropes
All eyes on me the streets got me in they scope
Ain't hard to tell a nigga reelin' in that dough
In a 4.6 range feelin' like the pope
I keep it real close this you can quote
For any motherfucker maybe feelin' like I'm joke
But I'm not Richard Pryor
But prior to rap I was cookin' crack over an open fire
Why they wanna try and play malicious
I'm humble to the point I down play my riches
This is what it is it's hard to be discreet
While the frank mueller watch play peak-a-boo to sleeve
Tucked in the chain in order for you to breathe
I'm out into a mote here this is you to me
The comparison is way to embarrasin'
Niggaz ain't averagin' what I'm averagin'

[Chorus/Clipse]
I don't mean to brag
I don't mean to boast, but
Baby I'm A Roller
Now move them things up and down the coast
Like daddy showed ya'
Keep heat close on the waist Fa-SHO
Always been a soldier
Hoes and money that's all I know
