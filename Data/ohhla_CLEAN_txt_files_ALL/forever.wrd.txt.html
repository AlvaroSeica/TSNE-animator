[Werd]
I forever endeavor
Like no matter the weather
If sun shine let in rain in time
Though skys grey getting better than ever
Set up a line
(I forever endeavor, I forever endeavor)
(I forever endeavor, I forever endeavor)
(And forever and ever)

I fell back as a youngster, amongst a
Bunch of fake friends so I learned what cunts were
Nothing but vultures, now I've got others
And we make tunes intertwining the cultures
Got stuck once I, plugged in that mic and
Went and got a mixer, pop shield and mic stand
But my life aint like what they like Im
Clutching at straws trying to make it in this strife can
You see me, or why I be, maybe one real reason I emcee
Because I failed me, hence I failed you
I said I'd show you more but I guess it fell through
I guess I had to show you that I meant it
And maybe this time a few more of you will get it (yeah)
Cause Im not aiming for the top (nah)
Its just all that I've got

I forever endeavor
Like no matter the weather
If sun shine I let in rain in time
Though skys grey 
Im getting better than ever
With each rhyme
Take other bit of coke out and set up a line [x2]

People listen, its sicken 
I hear them spitting fiction
So friction, it builds until Im quitting
Resisting to fit in, I'd rather slit my wrists and
Listen to Christian rap and make a living off that
In fact, Im spitting the facts 
And in that Im intact and be who I am
When you lie I just dont understand
How can you tell me what to be while fictions at hand?
See its hard, when youre looking at stars
And youre a distant sun with some distinct bars
But dissing this thing cause this aint hard
Seems anyone can make it so face it its not art

But just to stay on track
I do one thing and thats stay on tracks
So I guess Im on track 
If I look at this thing and how Im doing on tracks [x2]

I forever endeavor
Like no matter the weather
If sun shine I let in rain in time
Though skys grey 
Im getting better than ever
With each rhyme
Take other bit of coke out and set up a line

(I forever endeavor, I forever endeavor)
(I forever endeavor, I forever endeavor)
(And forever and ever)</pre>
