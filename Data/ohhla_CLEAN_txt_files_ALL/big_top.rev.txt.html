It's showtime!
"Rap now is a circus of clowns"

[Verse One] [Jaysaun]
I don't give a fuck about hip hop
I let the cig talk
And you can get wig rocked right under the big top
You clowns in the circus is really startin' to erk us
And the music that you're puttin' out sucks, so what's the purpose?
How the hell do you call yourself MC Who?
You ain't never learned a fuckin' thing that MC's do
When I think about niggas who spit it sicker than the flu
With the skills to eat a whole crew up, that ain't you
And I'm prejudice and racially biased to dick ridas
Who repeated profess to be fresh and to spit fire
It's this Ringling Brothers?
Is this Barnum and Bailey?
Or just monkey's ridin' round in the circles I'm seein' daily
You do not look gangsta on them 30 inch rims
You look gayer than Eddie Murphy ridin' round with a shim
On Sunset, so pussy, talkin' all of that gun shit
Throw your cards down on the table, you are down to just one chip

[Scratch Chorus] [x4]
"So step up if you wanna get" - Audio Two 'Top Billin'
"Down" - KRS-One 'My Philosophy'

This is the moment all of you have been waiting for.

[Circus master talking]
Ladies and gentlemen. Please direct your attention to the center ring
where we have some rappers and DJ's. Look at them go
Aren't they great with their big chains and diamond encrusted smiles?
Now folks, I don't know how they'll do it but in those tight clothes
they'll be performing some funny new dances
And if you notice how amazingly their heads will get bigger as the show goes on

[Verse Two] [Slaine]
Egos are filled up like red balloons
Up, up and away we go
With thug ballads and faggots like Khalid on my radio
There's plenty more of these 2Pac clones biting Jay-Z's flow
And dummy whores in videos
Get a job you lazy hoe
Go get a dick to suck on
A pop record to push
Your fifteen minutes is smush and your hot record is mush
All this cotton candy shit, my head is spinnin' like a Ferris Wheel
Ice grills and tough talk
Swearin' that it's really real
I'm drunk behind my steerin' wheel
Barkin' like a dog
But I'm not buying my guns in the parkin' lot of a mall
Especially with bank and platinum records on my shelves
Nobody's guys, I got my crew of weapons on themselves
The rest of you'se is sellouts and pains in the asses
I got the devil in my eye
(You write you name on your glasses)
This is Special Teamz, spitter Slaine
Trouble is my middle name
You cats are faker than the teardrops on Lil' Wayne

"Let's say we take that effort seriously" - Bahamadia
"You foolin' yourself"
"You so phony" - Nas 'Ether'

[Verse Three] [Edo G]
Hip hop done caught a tough break
Too much icing and not enough cake
Ring tone rappers walk a tight rope
Different colors and shapes
(Like what?)
Like a kaleidoscope
I remember when I used to spit in parks
Now we Get Familiar with that bullshit from Clinton Sparks
Now everybody's pistol sparks
With Rocsi &amp; Terrance on 106 &amp; Park
Huh
But I'm ignorin' your intent
Cause when I spit it's a historical event
You clowns is under a circus tent when I circumvent
With a violent attack
Special Teamz and Revolution
We a balancin' act
And these label's are the ring masters
For these trapeze artist
So watch how they trap these artists
When we see 'em we gon' smack these artists
