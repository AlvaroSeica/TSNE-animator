[Intro - Joe Budden - talking] - w/ Emanny harmonizing
Uh, this my love song

[Verse 1 - Joe Budden]
Check it, more questions (questions), more answers (answers)
More C-I smoke and more cancer (cancer)
More arguin (arguin), more resistance (uh)
It seems like the closer we get, there's more distance (more distance)
More angles (more angles), a million different looks
Was on the same page, just in different books (different books)
There's so much I want to say but I got no ground
'Cause we ain't break up, more like broke down
Now that pain and torture, add that with restraining orders
Then add the soul of my slain daughter
None of this is how we planned it to be
One big insanity plea, shit could never end amicably
I miss you tryin, you probably don't think I tried to
When you stubborn and prideful, not much is insightful
But God was tryin to show me something He ain't think that I knew
Sometimes shit that doesn't breathe could die too

[Chorus - Emanny]
Were we just dreamerz?
Waitin for our shot to shoot to the moon
Were we just dreamerz?
Spendin our lives tryin to see this thing through
Waitin to fly away
We're waitin to fly away
Waitin to fly away
waitin to fly away, right away and flyin by you

[Verse 2 - Joe Budden]
How we go from thoughts of marriage? Thoughts of me coppin karats
Talks of what we'd name her, while shoppin for a carriage
But when the dream stopped, who knew you'd see me like a savage?
That you dreamt of vacations, but only woke up to baggage
All you ever did was love me and look at where it got you (uh)
And when you wanted more, all I did was say "I'm not you"
I'm selfish not selfless and I say that with love
So in essence you askin for what I'm incapable of
So now I find I'm goin over choices I ain't even made yet (made yet)
Was clouded by good times and great sex (great sex)
Runnin fast towards an unknown fate
That altered when I introduced you to my unknown traits
In your dreams, seems you had me pegged as another man
But in mine, only you would understand
In our minds we were perfect, we witnessed our dream get murdered
Now reality's on trial and we both awaitin the verdict

[Break - Joe Budden] - w/ Emanny ad libs
But you'll always be close to me
Though you said this ain't how it's supposed to be
What we had was so real
But you said I don't care
Never thought this day would come
You said you gave your all and was left with none
But we can both be spared
But you don't think that's fair, that's fair

[Chorus] - w/ ad libs

[Verse 3 - Joe Budden]
Uh, you can't see how you ever began to like a liar
You lost track of all the little things that I admired
But when the peace left, I knew we might retire
Thinking man, I live upstairs, I'm something like Somaya
Got memories but at what point are they lost?
You say we could work through it, at what point is it forced?
We should of never rushed
'Cause it's like now we at a point where you won't ever trust
And for me I can't believe that's all we ever was
The high is gone, need a better buzz (better buzz)
'Cause we sleep in the same bed but we never touch (never touch)
My solution to every beef is to revisit
Though we'll have the same emotions, we won't be so livid, won't be so vivid
I think your girl secretly applauded our drama, we don't need those critics (uh)
We owe it to go over our foundation with a keen eye
Sad part to say you never have the same dream twice

[Break 2 - Emanny]
we let love and all it's possibility, take us from reality
Made it hard to see that (we were bound together)
Just to cover up the pain, I'm wishin the skies would rain
And wipe all my thoughts away, 'cause I'm tired of dreamin

[Chorus] - w/ ad libs</pre>
