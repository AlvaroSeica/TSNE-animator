(*talking*)
Yesterday's somebody, it could happen to you
Can be today's nobody, never forget ha-ha
The process, of success

[K-Rino]
I remember when he first, started writing in his class
He was raw and unpolished, but figured it out fast
Spitting flows for his partnas, had em all tripping
Freestyling to instrumentals, in the ride flipping
Having dreams, of putting his hood on the map
Females was even saying, girl he good he can rap
Made a low budget mixtape, did it for the love
Started hitting shows up, and wrecking mic's at the club
A young drug dealer, saw him getting down at the spot
Said let me drop some money behind him, and make it pop
Put him in a real studio, paid for some beats
In five months, twenty thousand units sold in the streets
Now he known in the city, life getting kinda sweet
People paying him to rap, and record labels trying to meet
And this happened so fast, it don't even seem real
Went from hanging on the corner, to a million dollar deal

[Chorus - 2x]
But it's a long way down, from the clouds to the ground
From arrogant to humble, from shallow to profound
From the stars to the planets, your first to your last day
For fools, the top of the mountain is only half way

[K-Rino]
With no hesitation he signed it, the money had him blinded
So non business minded, he never noticed the fine print
Couldn't wait for his new master, to cut the check out
First thing he did, was iced his whole neck out
Couldn't wait to make it back to the hood, and show out
Eighty five thousand dollar chain on, no house
Starting to see a new lifestyle, he didn't know bout
Women drugs VIP, every time he'd go out
Hooked on that Hollywood, thoughts rearranging
His homies saw his entourage, they noticed him changing
And many of em drop off, friends he was losing
The few that stayed around, only did so to use him
The shows he would pack em, the album went platinum
Expected the first check from that one, to be a fat one
No publishing was happening, deals under the table
Yeah the check was real big, not for him but the label

[Chorus - 2x]

[K-Rino]
Now the game's different, from the first day they signed him up
Plaque on his wall, but the money wasn't lining up
What happened to that cat, that financed his first album
The label paid him three hundred grand, to let them have him
Sold into slavery, struggling for cash flow
Trying to find out why his royalty check, was that low
The CEO said we financed, twenty two things
From cars to videos, do you know what recoup means
Had to fall back, show money he smoked and blew all that
Tried to contact old friends, none of em called back
These was the people, that was down when you was starving
Now he can't come around, his head is a target
Never gave nothing back, when you was on top
Kinda sad when the phone quits ringing, and shows stop
And his next project flopped, they dropped him in a sec
Now a welfare check, is the only one he collects

[Chorus - 2x]</pre>
