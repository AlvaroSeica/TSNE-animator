[Intro]
Kortney sends your love
Okay, Kaliko baby
I'd do anyway you gotta do it

[Chorus]
Send your love
Send your love
Send your love
Send your love
Send your love
(I wanna, I wanna send your love)
(Baby, send your love)
Send your love

Would you send your love to me?
Send your love

[Verse 1]
I got your message when you tweeted me
And you're askin me when I'm free
Said you left it in athe form of a letter
You e-mailed me to make me feel better
And a drive with mellow and a smiley face
I can update my status when I'm at yo place

That means face time with you and me
When you upgrade to 4G
You gotta send your love

[Chorus]
Send your love
Send your love
Baby... your love
Send your love
Send your love
Send your love
Send your love

[Verse 2]
Baby as a hotspot
Use me when your contracts
Choose me as your Facebook friend
I'll poke you all over again

[Chorus]
Gotta send your love
Send your love
Send your love
Baby, send your love
Send your love
Send your love
Send your love to me, girl
Send your love
Send your love

[Verse 3]
Just let me Skype with you tonight (tonight)
We're free to...
'Cus the feeling right
And I will text you some more pictures tonight
I want you to send your love

[Chorus]
Would you send your love?
Send your love
Yea yea
'Cus I need it baby
Send your love
Send your love
Yea
Just send your love
Send your love
I need you, I need you, I need you, I need you

[Outro]
Krizz
Wussup?
Do you love me?
Tonight I do
Shut up boy, you better be glad I love the nighttime</pre>
