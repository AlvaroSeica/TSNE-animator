[Bob Marley] (MC Lyte)
We jammin' (Bob Marley, Bob Marley)
I wanna jam it with you
We jammin' (Bob Marley, Bob Marley)
I hope you like jammin' too

[Bob Marley]
In rows or around, we can jam it anyhow
Eyeing, I will see you through
Everyday we pay the price, with a livin' sacrafice
Jammin' 'til the jam is through

[Bob Marley]
We jammin', to think that jammin' was a thing of the past
We jammin and I hope the jam is gonna last

[Bob Marley]
Nobody can stop us now, we need to (?)
We can't be bought nor sold
You can pay alright (?) your children everynight
Life is much more than gold

[Bob Marley] (MC Lyte)
We jammin' (Bob Marley, Bob Marley)
Jammin' in the name of the Lord
We jammin' (Bob Marley, Bob Marley)
Jammin' right from yord

[Bob Marley]
Oh Holy Mount Zion
Oh Holy Mount Zion
Oh Holy Mount Zion
Oh Holy Mount Zion

*Interlude*

[Bob Marley]
The mighty will te try, the truth it cannot hide
To keep you satisfied
Love that does exist, is the one the Lord presist
So jam by my side

[MC Lyte]
We jammin' on the for the daughters and sons
The struggle is not over until the battle is won
Hip-Hop is life but it ain't all to me
Now where would we be if they take life (?)
Or better yet strip on might itself
We done it before so I sit by the door
Those that claim but don't really know the game
Bob Marley, know the man behind the name

[Bob Marley] (MC Lyte)
We jammin' (Bob Marley, Bob Marley)
I wanna jam it with you
We jammin' (Bob Marley, Bob Marley)
I hope you like jammin' too

[Bob Marley]
Alright, alright

[Bob Marley] (MC Lyte)
We jammin' (Know the man behind the name)
We jammin' (Know the man behind the name)
We jammin' (Know the man behind the name)
We jammin' (Know the man behind the name)
Hope you like jammin' too</pre>
