[Intro: Bill the Butcher from 'Gangs of New York' sample (Specman)]
You know how I stayed alive this long, all these years? Fear.
The spectacle of fearsome acts. Someone steals from me, I cut off his hands.
He offends me, I cut out his tongue.
He rises against me, I cut off his head, and stick it on a pike.
Raise it high up, so all on the streets can see.
That's what preserves the order of things. Fear.
(Yo Fantom, straight up and down, dog
I'mma start smacking muthafuckas)

[Specman]
Pictures bloodplots, sex off, from a bloody block
That we blessed techs on, from another block
Hide in the mess hall, brained all fucked up
Did a stretch ya'll, county bid, four months in, I can't rest ya'll
Walk around, thinking you down, I don't respect ya'll
Sing Sing, step in the ring, I go to wreck ya'll
Fags who be washing my drawers, in a sec, ya'll
Fishskill North, ya'll ask about Specs, ya'll
Brought the name back to the hood, so we can rep ya'll
Stronged out, more wild, we gon' bang to the death, ya'll
Yes son, I hear you talking but you ain't seen your breath
Now you don't even got my box time in yet, ya'll
I got seventeen stabbings out there, ya'll
Rep ya'll, serving up eighteen, whose next ya'll?
D-Block, crimestock, have you even met, ya'll?

[Choru: Specman]
My crime, my pain, my woes, my reign
My brain is stained, my time is changed
My code and how I changed the game
It made me who I am, my name is Specs

[Specman]
You don't like me? Fuck you!
Buck me 'fore I buck you
My click come through, run through
Bare knuckle boxer on pay per view
Lot of MC's pop shit but what you gon' do?
Populace, split ya shit like one-two
Who you gon' run to? This white boy'll sun you
It's not Em, it's Specs, no jokes it's just Tecs
Wear a vest? I don't shoot through ya chest
I aim at ya head and ya neck, then ya kneecaps is next
That's fun, cuz the pain's more intense
I shot kids so I could say it in my rhymes
The rest did arraigned and attained for some time
Changin' the game and I'm takin', it's mine
You wanna rap, geek? Where's the rap sheet to coincide?

[Chorus]

[Specman]
Most say, 'yo Specs you're gone'
I disagree, I say they wrong
Move like a king, they be moving like a pawn
Started with the Surrah and the Holy Qu'ran
Add on and on, and build back to born
But the death came here, so I gotta move on
Allah U Akbar, cuz I made it this long
Stand strong in the storm, I'm protected
People ask why, I shot Howard, if I meant it
No, I guess not, I meant to shoot the other guy
But he was in the wrong spot, life's like a card game
Gotta work with what you got, I was working with not alot
And made it pop, and now look who can't be stopped
Shot up, Specman, on top</pre>
