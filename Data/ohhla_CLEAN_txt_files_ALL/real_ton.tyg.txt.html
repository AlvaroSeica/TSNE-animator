Typed by: AZ Lyrics

it's getting real tonight, you aint the only bitch on my mind
I can make you feel alright, but I ain't gonna fuss a fight
every girl I see I like, so why wanna waste your time?
you know the deal uh? I'm right
ya I'm for real love, I'm right, it's gettin real tonight

my time ticker on tres, fucking all night, midnight sex
she ride like my old bitch, but she already knew that
she feel me even when I'm gone, pillows between her legs, now she comfortable
extend your back vovo , volcano when the shit explode, boom
picture me tied down for life, I flash too bright, picture won't look right
I need god advice dealing with these lady mice
girls like planes enter the next flight

it's getting real tonight, you aint the only bitch on my mind
I can make you feel alright, but I ain't gonna fuss a fight
every girl I see I like, so why wanna waste your time?
you know the deal uh? I'm right
ya I'm for real love, I'm right, it's gettin real tonight

iphone just filled with hoes, conversation goes, back and forth
what you doing? chilling like eskimos?
bet I eat your pussy good like vegetables
nasty, nigger but you like it though
freaky ass scorpio she ride me like carnivos
and I'm horny though, sex in the morning though
hormones got my snowboard going verticle
vertigo, dizzy on my love boat, heard she got a party mouth
wash ya ass out with soap
damn we fuck again, she ain't my lover, we just cudi budi friends

it's getting real tonight, you aint the only bitch on my mind
I can make you feel alright, but I ain't gonna fuss a fight
every girl I see I like, so why wanna waste your time?
you know the deal uh? I'm right
ya I'm for real love, I'm right, it's gettin real tonight</pre>
