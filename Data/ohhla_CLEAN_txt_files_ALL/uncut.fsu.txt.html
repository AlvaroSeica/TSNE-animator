Typed by: jostmatt@bluewin.ch

Check this out
We gon' run this muthafucka here live
So ah - Warren, won't you get on the lead
And ah - Ron, won't you hit the bass
Mr. Loc, peep these lyrics
Check it

Since it's a new day, Fesu is gonna swing to a new beat
Hit the swisher sweet, then hit them streets to make them ends meet
A statistic token
My home's already broken
Takin a pull of that potent
To my click, I'm they road dog
A mutt in the street gettin full of that damn hog
Hangin on the cut with my niggaroes
Hittin licks and throw fuck on these deakin hoes
Cause I'm a local rap singer
So fuckin with chickenheads to Fe is just a misdemeanor
But in the 'Point you'll get what you want
A five dollar hit of this dope, or just some uncut funk

And you don't stop
A little live shit for ya
For the 9-4
And this is how it goes
Peep this shit here
Second verse

I can't get a job, cause I'm black
But I sho' need one, because my girlfriend's gettin fat
Mama's kickin me down with them ends
I love that woman, she gives me love in and out the pen
But I'm about to blow a fuckin fuse
Cause I'm a grown-ass man, but still wearin l'il boy shoes
I gotta get my act right
Takin a hit of that alright tryin to get my damn thoughts tight
Cause I really don't give a fuck
I need a break from reality, man, I need some uncut funk

See, I don't have any friends, only brothers
Cause friends'll fuck your gal, steal your money, then try to hustle ya
But me, you hoes gets none
Cause my brothers stand strong in the Fruit, Nation of Islam
Them woods tryin to see me
But I don't kiss white ass, damn devil, please believe me
Cause I'm a hard-ass nut to crack
You taught your niggas how to kneel and bow down, but not to fight back
I'm just trippin off these weed smokes
But watchin every goddamn move of these white folks
I can't sell my dope because you'll bust me
Unless I sell it to my own, then you don't touch me
But then again you a greedy bitch
Want me to sell yo dope to my people and make yo ass rich
I wanna break you off a proper chunk
Of this dick in yo mouth, bitch, and some uncut funk

Yeah
This is how the niggas from Greenspoint kick it
So ah - I gotta shout out to my boys
Mr. Loc
That nigga King Daddy
Black
D-Ray
And Dirt Cheek
The niggas down with the program
And ah - if you got a problem with Fe
Hook up with my attorney Warren X Fitzgerald
And you don't stop
Ron layin his muthafuckin bass
In yo face
Southpark in the house too, nigga
You know it
Fesu outta this bitch
