Ladies and gentlemen, The Signal
We sending it out
Can you hear me
Aha, yeh we coming home now right
(Please come home), check it out, you with me?
You come along with Urthboy and Count Bounce now
(Please come home)
(1-2 can you hear me!)

[Verse 1]
You understand what we got up on in the fast lane
Express conga line to underline the last name
It seem's we're behind and we don't wanna start late
This adrenaline is meddling with the heart rate (uh)
Some of them list well it's unticked and can't wait
Can't take to sit still and can't break
Can't shake the shit, cos through it all we
still partake in it, facing it like we haven't lost faith in it
Of course you got stakes in it
It's not a matter of you wastin it
Like black crude in Kuwaitn' it
Cat o' nine tails rat-racing it
Spend all our days in it, raising it
Cut to the paper chase and it gets cold
Gets sold like fools gold gets extolled
Your absence felt ten-fold 
And if you don't know that you're welcome home behold

[Chorus]
We've shared too much to not be blunt
And if I didn't give a shit I'd probably just front
That's why I'm sending out the signal
(Please come home)
(1-2 can you hear me)
We've shared too much to not be blunt
And if I didn't give a shit I'd probably just front
That's why I'm sending out the signal
(Please come home)
(1-2 can you hear me)

[Verse 2]
Yes indeed, we need to plant seeds
That not mean to leave cos life is lightspeed
Get it all together dot the 'I's and cross the Ts
I've not got the key nor philosophies like Socrates
It hasn't always been a perfect fit but
It aint a contract either party need to rip up
Don't want no mix up, you could get a lift up
Nobody decapitated others over hiccups (yo)
You're the kind of person that you notice when they're gone
And the little hand tocks as the clock ticks on
And I miss that song that we sung so long ago
I know a little place you can dock your boat (right there)
Your not Ronnie Biggs your really not on the run
It's like I haven't seen you since the Rabbitohs won
So welcome back whenever you come (when you come)
(Please come home), I see your silhouette in the sun

Look I can't stand the distance
I'll give up all pre-conditions
All will be forgiven and if you (Please come home)
Ok, I said it
Look I can't stand the distance
I'll give up all pre-conditions
All will be forgiven and if you (Please come home)
I'm sending out The Signal

[Chorus]

*Muffled*
aha yeh something like that, something like that
awww get lost right back (ohhh man)
