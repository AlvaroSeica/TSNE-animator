[Intro: Saigon]
I'd like to thank my collaborators
You know, none of us are really singers, but we try
My collaborators, DJ Corbett, the legendary Chamillionaire
Let's have some fun with it y'all, c'mon

[Chorus: Chamillionaire + Corbett]
Cause I've been up, and I've been down
And if it's one thing that I've found
You gotta keep pushin baby
I swear it feels like we almost made it
We on the way up, yeah don't look down
Cause we so high off the ground
But you gotta keep pushin baby
To the top, yeah we almost made it (ba-by)

[Saigon]
Uhh, I relate more to struggle than to corks and the bubbles
Your pain's never champagne when you always in trouble
I'm at the dealership but I'm sellin these cars
It's a result of collectin my second felony charge
Watchin fellas get large spittin bullshit bars
It's like a mirage, niggaz only write for the broad
As far as I could recall, there was only one Todd
One teacher, one king, one God that seen all
Rookies they don't respect the sport - like they totally forgot
Came second thought, they don't seem to reflect no more
That's why they comin out soundin so similar
It's quite confusin, for you to remember the
originator, boy do I hate a fuckin perpetrator
Hate a record label slave trader
My story the recipe of a grown man
Had to go put my destiny in my own hands, bam

[Chorus]

[Saigon]
I ain't emerge to tell ya how I splurge on the birds
I don't give 'em nothin but words and still hit the curve
then swerve, to another nerve, murder superb
They heard that Giddy like they heard in the word
33-and-a-third of what I spit is verbally as absurd
Number 33-and-a-third is addictive as herb, ya heard?
Come try and punk a nigga
I'll run ya over, hit your head with the bumper sticker
It's gon' take a month to fix ya
I'm bein sincere when I say that you'll be in intensive care
I don't think you really wanna visit there
Flow water, words float like a motor boat
Been there and done it dunny, I know the ropes, quote-unquote
Front on me I'll go for broke, smoke with me it's toke for toke
Joke with me I'm funny as Kevin Hart makin Oprah jokes
Oops, I said "jokes" twice, but that's aight
These motherfuckers know that I'm nice~!

[Chorus]</pre>
