(*talking*)
Everything can be forgiven
But certain thangs, can't be forgotten
Pride comes before the fall

[Hook - 2x]
Pride thought you was down to ride for me, thought you would be down for me
Then you turned your back on me, now on me
Pride I never thought you'd turn fake, you talk love but you full of hate
Disrespect the family, all because of

[Trae]
Nigga we be the real guerillas and down to bust heads
M double A-B for life it ain't changed
When it's time to get crunk you better run to the trunk
'fore your pride serve fuck around and get you stomped
Let's get ready to rumble you know where we at
when the shit hit the fan ain't no time to lay low
You better run inside or straight up get ghost
before your fans get a chance to see you get hold
It's real over here, 3D to the 2 motherfuckers better check their self
Before they fuck around and wreck theyself
and when they get a flatline ain't a nigga that can save your health
We ain't playing no more I done got pissed off
you wanna plex on wax you fake ass bitch
You started the plex now it's time to get it over
we the shit bitch I know you smell the odor

[Dougie D]
I know you better try to swallow your pride
before your pride fuck around and swallow you up and fuck you up
The same nigga with my pants leg up don't give a fuck
about what you bitch niggaz say and what
My nigga look see pride is cool
but too much pride'll make a motherfucker go down the drain
Lost to realize why you came
cause I remember when we all said it would be a family thang

[Hook - 2x]

[Dougie D]
A lot of motherfuckers talk a big game
mention my name to try to build up fame
Talk about a ruger ripping we giving a motherfucker ruger
or we passing the bitch nigga leaking or living
You wanna talk down on every song
enough was enough you bout to make a motherfucker whoop your dome
Because you already know you a hoe
but you don't really wanna be fucking around and get your bitch ass rolled
I never really never knew that I
would be a victim of life of somebody that said do it now
You bring your bitch and her kid over to my crib
and on the down low try to make her move on in
You need to be a man instead of a bitch
quit holding out your hand looking for the next man to get you rich
And all that shit about you being the shit
well you could suck my dick cause you ain't never been no shit

[Trae]
And man I'd never forget your life or get fucked up
and we the niggaz that'll beat your ass
We started together but that don't mean a damn thang nigga you be the blame
you wanna turn your back because of the fame
And got everybody looking at us like we jump fly
you better use your fucked up head before it's gone
Steady showing off for everybody in a safe place
might mess around and get your bitch ass erased

[Hook - 4x]</pre>
