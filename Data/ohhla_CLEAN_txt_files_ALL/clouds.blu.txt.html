My mama see the clouds and wonder when she gettin there
Like she done done it all, starin up at Heaven's stairs
Everybody's time comin, better get prepared
I see the clouds and feel at home - cause my head is there
Life is but a dream, live it 'fore it disappear
The parade'll pass you by if you sit and stare
My mans told me that my talent level's very rare
But just havin talent ain't enough to get you there
While you was out there chasin girls drinkin beer
Somebody else is out there really gettin theirs
You gotta turn it up if you wanna win this year
I said, 'Hell yeah, that's all I need to hear'
My bio say Ohio, I handle business here
Though I ain't been inspired by it in a year
Too tired of the infightin with my peers
While our mouths was runnin the art was sittin still
All this beef only stops us from gettin bread
We just gettin by, we never get ahead
Consider this rhyme the realest shit I ever said
Gotta go for mine cause I ain't got 50 years
All we wanna do is talk about shoes and gear
Soundin like chicks talkin 'bout they nails and hair
I guess it's easier than talkin 'bout what's really there
We lost three Columbus icons within a year
So I ain't 'bout to do the same record, different year
I used to be in that lane but now I'm steerin clear
I ain't gased up, I'm just switchin gears
Cause in this game goin slow won't get you anywhere
I want the illest crib, even though I'm barely here
I'm ridin through the fliest neighborhoods just to stare
Feelin like I can't chill until I'm livin there
If you feel me let me see a finger in the air
Every year I swear the haters get more vocal
Dudes is callin me fake because I'm not social
But this could come to an end if I'm not focused
So if it ain't about the biz then it's not important
I don't care about the after party that you hostin
I don't care about the soft white and who snorts it
I don't care about the fist fight and who caught it
Cause at the end of the night, man, it's all gossip
Fuck all the drama, I'm a real artist
I do this shit without any feedback or comments
I'll diss anybody from the largest to the smallest
And they won't say shit cause my album is the hardest
I'll start at '88, then bring you up to date
Then skip ten years ahead so you won't have to wait
I'm what the future sounds like and I'ma make you see it
I'm so ahead of the game that people think I'm cheatin
But once you really see it it ain't all that hard
The rap game's like Vegas, I'm just countin cards
Sittin at the table, 'bout to defy the odds
And nah, I ain't scared at all (because the world is ours)</pre>
