[Intro: Anthony Hamilton]
Lies... and the pain
Betrayal... life

[Anthony Hamilton]
In danger's face
Look what you're facing, gave your heart away
And all the remedies couldn't ease the pain
All the hurt and betrayal, need to get away...
In a world so cold
You gain the life just to lose your soul
Never thinking twice 'bout what the future holds
All the lies and the games not worth fighting for

[Chorus: Anthony Hamilton]
The world is an addiction
Serving up our fix
The world is an addiction
Way too much for me

[Nas]
Snitches and rapists in the street, crime to the fullest
Askin niggaz if they got any extra nine bullets
They deny me that, they know the bullets they loan me
be the same ones that probably had them lyin flat stretched out - letter T
It's better to dead a beef than let it breathe, then we don't succeed
Cause then you gotta murder dummies, waste your time, they allergic to money
I'm never squirmish to blood, we can thug, it get out of hand
What's the options? Only conclusion is shooting
Bullets poppin, hoodlums droppin
Fear any day that the feds will come knockin
Was young and nervous, askin myself what's my purpose
In the back of a paddy wagon, bracelets achin me
Pigs ignorin, I'm askin what precinct they taking me...
These cops can't relate to me
Death to prison, empty vacancy

[Chorus]

[Nas]
Thou shall not be selfish, real nigga commandments
Know a billionaire, he has everything but a fam
Guess, how angry this man gets
Had so many bad chicks in his bed
Strange sex, same sex
Has addictions that are sadistic
Chain of events, habits
He puts cocaine on his prick and acts sick
Self-esteem needs boostin, alcohol consumption
Nicotine fusion, some athletes juicin
Pastors quote biblical chapters, Psalms
All along he's into bestiality porn
And it's wrong, so I keep the Cali weed in the bong
And I'm strong but the female anatomy got me sprung
And these women need shoes and baddest cars and condos
Fine clothes, and these fiends needs 
to get high so they find dough, to mainline dope, and y'all know...

[Chorus]

[Nas]
So many vices, habits, mine of course: bad chicks
My response to any advice on what is the essentials of life
I'm just rebellious, not selfish
Guess we all share different definitions of what wealth is
I need the best things in life, that's women, that's cars
Cigars in Venice, bottle on ice, that's priceless
The other night, just in the emergency room
A patient said she needs to see a doctor soon
Doctor busy operating on a lady who's sedated
He can barely concentrate, cause he's newly separated
His estranged wife likes entertainin her acquaintance
In the house they were married in, mad people waitin
Some young some old, heads and stomachs achin
Fillin out an application cause they all need medication
But the doctor need love or a quick, vacation
Callin up his travel agent
Same time, premedidating murdering his ex-wife
Life, savage ain't it?
Some need Xanax just to maintain it
We all need faith cause the world keep changing
Let go of the illusion, start some restraining

[Outro: Anthony Hamilton]
Oooooooooooh-ahhhhhhhhh....
Ahhhhhhhh-ahhhhhh-ahhhhhh...ahhh..
Just hold on (Just hold on) {7x}
Just hold on (...hold on)</pre>
