[talking]
Yo.. what's up.
For those who don't know.
I go by the name of Tech N9ne.
I'm gonna let you in on a little secret.
Some of the things already known, that are familiar with me.
and my thoughts.. so these are the real thoughts.
I'ma share with you.. like this.

[Tech N9ne]
Don't you come near me cuz the Devil's sittin next to me
I drink my drink, and smoke my weed and pop my ecstasy
Then add some GHB and mushrooms to the recipe
This means I'm really lettin the beast within get the best of me

[Tech N9ne's inner voices]
If you can hear me, I need help
I'm caught and I'm stuck and I'm trapped in this self
Don't understand this fucked up hand that G dealt
Lazarus help me cuz it's hazardous to T's health
He's set trippin - he's tryna get a nigga killed
and get a nigga peeled, the otherside is gonna rid 'em in the field
No sentimental feelings, send 'em in the cold buildings
I tried to tell him where you go you will not see your women and your children
He popped, fifteen hits of ex in one night
Lick dick tips have sex with some dykes
And he won't use protection for my erection
Constantly makin me get that pencillin injection

[Tech N9ne]
Wait, I hear voices, speakin from inside
I'm out front waitin, he creepin and he hides
I can't help but notice he's kinda stuck up, I'ma let it slide
But in the meantime shut the fuck up, and just ride

[Chorus]
Oooooh... I'm a psycho baby.
Oooooh... it's about to drive me crazy.
Oooooh... I'm a psycho baby.
Oooooh... it's about to drive me crazy.

[Tech N9ne]
When I was younger I used to faint at the sight of blood
Now that I'm older I notice that it ain't at the sight of blood
Now the sight of blood equals the very first sign of love
Menstrual cycles, feeling like you right at your height of drugs
Bleed for me baby, made your heart rage
Fuckin you makes me feel a murderous sensation, blood mixed with ejaculation
Cum bustin, bump heads 'til concussions
After we done fuckin, if I can't get the spirit I've won nothin

[Tech N9ne's inner voices]
I got children, and a wife
He's thinkin of leapin off a buildin, takin flight
By now somebody shoulda killed him, end his life
Too many motherfuckers feel him, and his mic
Somebody stop him cuz he's fuckin up my livelihood
With me trapped inside this psycho how can I be good
To my wife the (?) only close to it for money, he's in it
A monster running back and forth from the free clinic
If you a friend, time to say toodaloo
Cuz ain't no possible way he can ever be true to you
Careful your appointment could do the due
If he wants to kill hisself, what the fuck you think he wanna do to you?

[Chorus]

[Tech N9ne (inner voices)]
I am a nightmare walkin, psychopath talkin
Brain deteriorating cuz I'm ex pill poppin
I got more troubles, whatever you got it doubles and triples
and quadruples, havin fantasies of eatin nipples and noodles
Drugs - take the pain away
Used to have a lotta love - but now I fade away
The fact, that women love the music and they open they legs
for a psychopathic nigga that's so fucked up in the head, it's beautiful
(Told my parents this isn't suitable)
Devil bitches'll learn (No!) Gotta recruit a few
(This nigga's gonna do me harm! I'm drugged up and I'm torn!)
(Look at this motherfucker he colored my hair orange!)
You can't touch me, everybody loves me
Listening to my music, children are gettin ugly
If I told you everything I was thinkin it wouldn't be G
Tellin you how many crossed my path just wouldn't be me
But they know, cuz they way low
About some ex and fry and jayo - and fuck a halo
Alotta Jim Beam to have grim dreams would be healthy
(Aiyyo I'm trapped in psycho's body, can ya help me?)

[Chorus] - 3X
