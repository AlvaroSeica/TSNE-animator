[Verse One: Steele] (Tek)
This thing build from the ground up
Around hounds and pups it sounds tough salute to the founders
Grew up underground with the shooters and scoundrels
Don't assume what confuse us with the losers around you
(Stay in tuned with the movers) Got the news of them clowns too
(A little birdie told me how he think that he found you)
I'm deuce like to let me loose in the booth with the pound too
Crush a dog out a squad call the mob to surround you

[Verse Two: Tek] (Steele)
Chuck Tee's!!! With a beast got sweatshirts
Black Republic chain, millionaire net worth
(Firfty cal with some white Hennessy I'm the O-N-E!!!)
Y'all are Mini Me's!
Plus! You know my style's undeniable
(Bullets untraceable) Respect unbuyable!
So! Kill yourself if you curse my name
Before you face the mob and the Beard Gang!

[Chorus: Tek] (Smif-N-Wessun) (*Pete Rock Scratchin)
(I'm goin off!) Like a grenade, with a bullpen
(I'm goin off!) Like a Lifer, that's fresh in
(I'm goin off!) Like a mob flick, you see the credits
(I'm goin off!) Like a hungry fat bitch yeah I said it!
(I'm goin off!) Like a nigga built off revenge
(*G-G-G-Go off I go off!-"Spoonie Gee")
(I'm goin off!) Like a shots from a cannon
(*G-G-G--G-Go off I go off!-"Spoonie Gee")

[Verse Three: Tek] (Steele)
(Come on!) Black rocks (What!) In my black watch (What!)
I'm in all black (I'm on my black ops!)
My hammer back like the roof is
Burn your top like a steak out of Ruth's
(Yeah! You killa killa be a killa!
Cause ain't nobody fuckin with me and my niggas!)
Yeah! So fuck your life with a dirty dick
Diarrhea on all y'all niggas! 'Cause we the shit!

[Verse Four: Steele] (Tek)
Man! Your rap's calculated hood cats are mild grenaded
And we don't hang with no fakers we hang around greatness
The foundation (Smif-N-Wessun) trey pound wakers
(As-Salaam Alaikum) Go hard God he's just turkey bacon
The flow covered I roll with the Soul Brother
Plus the ack got the budget to make the career slow up
(This team's situated) Beamer or nickel plated
Since we enter stages they sick we made it, we invaded!

[Chorus: Tek] (Smif-N-Wessun) (*Pete Rock Scratchin)
(I'm goin off!) Like a grenade, with a bullpen
(I'm goin off!) Like a Lifer, that's fresh in
(I'm goin off!) Like a mob flick, you see the credits
(I'm goin off!) Like a hungry fat bitch yeah I said it!
(I'm goin off!) Like a nigga built off revenge
(*G-G-G-Go off I go off!-"Spoonie Gee")
(I'm goin off!) Like a shots from a cannon
(*G-G-G--G-Go off I go off!-"Spoonie Gee")
