[Bronze Intro Talk]
Yeah, yeah, yo yeah They say the man with a clear conscious,
(Blindman) Probably got a bad memory, yeah

[Bronze Nazareth]
Yeah burn a incense while I indent
Eyes squint, turn a leaflet to golden scribe with
Words that graze the face through Jackson pen fence
I broadcast adverbs, and we them back lane renaissance masters
Paint shadows of my DNA, thrill is gone chapters
Fasten a heat stroke, I'm blastin a sneak close
Unraveling shells like platinum sheets rolled
As blunt leaves conspire to thieve my chromosomes
The beat fleets retire, my senses overblown
Rocks glisten off my throne by the lake
We burn blake, inner city goon set Obama hand shake
Sun fish bake, roll upon your 6th sense, arrive late
Lick shit, my square hot as bisquick, but I ate
To put it fair, I'm on a finer district so dilate
You wouldn't smother a lit wick, or light it anyway
The featherweight vs. heavyweight,
Treasure speak, never bend never break
Sever hands while better grams levitate
Yo It's the Bronzeman get it straight! Nigga!

[Bronze Talk]
Ayo I'd rather write for myself, and have no listeners
(It's that Gun Rule boy!)
Then to write for the listeners, and have no self, Real Talk
Let's go, I got the hammer to 'em!
Put it on 'em son, get 'em kid get 'em!

[Bronze Nazareth]
It's me kid, sit with a fifth, sip free kid
water your eyes, float the skies to techniques kid
Follow the street script, I hollow unique tips
Bottle swallowing model, obstacle pothole scene Â– lived
life on a minor D pitch, stay weeded when needed
secrets stroll rich streams, with parapalegics
my struggles so deep titanic manic releases
Cracked sidewalks, take it in like a sip of beer
The rocks look like gravel, the judge slams the gavel near
Kidnap, shrink wrap the D.A. on the court chair
I'm more rare, sharp like papercut,
catch a gun rule skyscraper snuff
phallus elevator shaft cable, blemish blunts
Dunham Lane tutored, with the aim of huey newton
That could stain a sane stable man if he went thru it
Grasp life like chloroform towel, double stuffed sewage
Kings mask with a crack for a smile, snuff Judas

[Poem Sample]
We real cool
We left school
We lurk late
We strike straight
We sing sin
We thin gin
We jazz june
We Die. Soon.
