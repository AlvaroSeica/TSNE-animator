I'm sittin at the ACC, anticipatin laughs
My backstage pass laminate hangs
A proud friend seated in the bleachers
Stadium status, started from scratch
Spins radio classics, the beats kill
Thousands of tickets scanned, the seats filled
When I grow up, I wanna be like him
The beat got louder, the lights dimmed
A short video played on the big screens
The sound drowned in the howling of thick screams
That got louder, when out walked the one feature
It was BeatleMania, for Russell Peters

It was just a week ago when
I was skimmin magazines on an indigo shelf
When I saw him on the cover of a Readers Digest
Dope~! My fingers gripped the spine and
Flipped it to the page where his article was printed
I read the Q&amp;A grinnin
I went back to a quote about his dad passin a year prior
A quote I can relate to
I wish I couldn't but the cards were dealt
It was up to us to play the game through
And play strong cause nobody gets to play two
When his dad died he was generating
close to 80 G's a year, a couple hundred heads
at Yuk-Yuks paid to see him, a commendable career
But heaven needed an angel
When his dad died, that's when success came to see him
Worldwide attention, hail-ups and cheers
Pockets gained weight, moved out the Yuk-Yuks basements
And into stadiums and theaters
He fought through the heartache and pain
His father became, his guardian angel
I was rowin in the same boat, sort of
Far from makin the same dough, but after
my father died, that's when I started strollin
down the paved road to makin my name known
My father always hated me in rap music
Told me I fucked up by bein a bad student
I'd tell him "One day, I'll win a damn Juno
And you and me will be there in matchin black suits"
He'd roll his eyes and laugh like I was jokin
Then ask me to pass him whatever I was smokin
My dad left me an orphan
I filled a notepad with my story, "The Book" dropped
and kids ate up my new EP
Hopped on a jet plane to Vancouver, B.C.
Nominated for my first J
On March 29th, my birthday
One step closer to fulfillin my old dream
But I was only one half of the whole team
Even though he was watchin from the nosebleeds
He wasn't with me in the hairy rows
And I kept thinkin to myself this is not fair
All I wanted was my pop there
With me sitting at the B.C. Place, anticipatin claps
His backstage pass laminate hangs
A proud dad, seated in the bleachers
Stadium status...</pre>
