[Tech N9ne]
I want you to quit
Callin me callin me
Followin me followin me
Why do you trip with me
After you get through swallowin me?
Never knew this bianca would explode (Like this)
Now that I know this I must reload (Gat clips)

How many ever met a psycho bitch?
Down with for the minute but a major twist
Came with a bit of game
Met that Bitch Sickness
Everybody peep the evil symptoms so you'll know
When sexual activity happens and tears start to flow
Time to go, they come with a big package and back
Chest is twice that
But the fatal attraction would only get you ice packs
Better watch what you do when you sleep with a woman that's on the edge
In yo bed
Cause you'll be restin in red (Killa killa)
They'll find the number to yo residence
Non-hesitant
Unpresidented
Ain't no mystery to her steez
She's demented
Ain't ever gonna get myself mix up with a Psycho Bitch
Millimeter with a master plan so you won't be off in the ditch (Like this)

Wild child
Runnin wild behind the smile is a frown
That'll make ya lay it down quickly
She shifty
Killa strictly out to come and get me
From a rose to three fifty seven three sixty
Psycho Bitch!

[Chorus]
Never ever do it down low with a (Psycho Bitch!)
Better never ever go out with a (Psycho Bitch!)
Everybody better learn to see a (Psycho Bitch!)
Cause yo bitch might just be her
What chu gonna do pop at you glock at you
Fill em with the venom who the fuck are we talking to?
(Psycho Bitches, Psycho Bitches)
What chu gonna do pop at you glock at you
Fill em with the venom who the fuck are we talking to?
(Psycho Bitches, Psycho Bitches)

[Tech N9ne]
I was holdin her, huggin her
Rubbin her, suckin her
Kissin her, pluggin her
But she thought that I was lovin her

All the lovin was gone when she found out she was wrong
Callin my momma's house at 3 AM (Quit playin on my phone!)

They say the Psycho Bitch was made from us (Psycho Bitches)
Say they get nothing but hate from us (Psycho Bitches)
From the Anghellic you ravenous (Psycho Bitches)
Stay the fuck away from us (Psycho Bitches, Psycho Bitches)

She got my gas cut off but I don't know how
She got my phone cut off but I don't know how
Bitch even got my lights cut off but I don't know how
Wish I knew back then what a nigga know now (Crazy bitch!)

Follow me to my main thangs
Domain
This dame brings mo pain
Door chain
Broke after the door rang
Must be on cocaine
Insane yanks will mess up yo thang
No brain bitches will have you stressin using Rogaine

Didn't chill wit her
Deal wit her
Nina had to get ill wit her
Trick tried to kill Mrs. N9ne
So I had to hit her wit a grill spliter
Never do sex with a psycho bianc
Anybody wit her better pop yo trunk
Run better get a gun when the bitch come better know she a psycho (Killa
killa)

Hard when he hit that piece and then get her up and out with a dis
Scarred when he knows he been up in the mix with a Psycho Bitch
Hard when he hit that piece and then get her up and out with a dis
Scarred when he knows he been up in the mix with a Psycho Bitch

[Chorus]
Never ever do it down low with a (Psycho Bitch!)
Better never ever go out with a (Psycho Bitch!)
Everybody better learn to see a (Psycho Bitch!)
Cause yo bitch might just be her
What chu gonna do pop at you glock at you
Fill em with the venom who the fuck are we talking to?
(Psycho Bitches, Psycho Bitches)
What chu gonna do pop at you glock at you
Fill em with the venom who the fuck are we talking to?
(Psycho Bitches, Psycho Bitches)

[Tech N9ne]
As the smoke clears
You wonder why this woman packs the most fear
She keeps a broken heart and a three-eighty close near
From me to you
If you sense she's psychotic better watch what you do, what they do

They say the Psycho Bitch was made from us (Psycho Bitches)
Say they get nothing but hate from us (Psycho Bitches)
From the Anghellic you ravenous (Psycho Bitches)
Stay the fuck away from us (Psycho Bitches, Psycho Bitches)</pre>
