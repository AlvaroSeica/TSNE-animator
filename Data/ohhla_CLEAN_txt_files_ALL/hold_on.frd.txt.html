[Pimp]
Say hold on bitch, you drivin too fast
I'm supposed to be draggin my foot
out yo' motherfuckin ass
Said bitch I'm known from the Golden Gates of Frisco
to the Eagles past
I'm known to play big time landlord
Kick chickenshit hoes, right in they motherfuckin ass
And if my luck continues to hold out in the future
like it has in the past
I'm gon' continue to kick you chickenshit hoes
right in yo' motherfuckin ass
Said bitch this is in the Worlds of Wonder
Long dick book bender
All night grinder
Womb finder, sheet shaker
Baby maker, and money taker - bitch...</pre>
