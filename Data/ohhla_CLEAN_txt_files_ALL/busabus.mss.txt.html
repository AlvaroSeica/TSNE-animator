Yes indeed, YES INDEED out this motherfucker
Back with the right foot steppin in first
and the left foot steppin in after
I go by the divine attribute, of Bus-A-Bust-Down-Some'n
Otherwise known as Busta-motherfuckin-Rhymes out this bitch
Yknahmean?  Cause when I'm in the spot

[rapping]
I let a bitch start kissin up
And muh'fuckers love the way that I be pissin up
on muh'fuckers, muh'fuckers need to chill, RELAX
What they need to do is listen up, muh'fuckers

[talking]
So.. as we begin, to get you addicted

You know one of your PEOPLES, that stay sober
You know to make sure you get home safely
