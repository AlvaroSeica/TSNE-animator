[Intro: Makeba Mooncycle]
Peace and welcome to the Points Club
Everyone in for 10 dollars only
Get your points on your light skinned chicks
Get your points on the dark skinned brothers
Everybody come in, come in, get your points on
Get your points on...

[Makeba Mooncycle]
From the moment I touched down
The Earth tremble from the underground, see the pounds
Feel the sounds, sit back and lounge, I get perplexed
Every word tickles larynex, don't get vexed
Just set, your friends place bet
The hottest thing your eyes catch, no game can match
I'm setting fire, son rule supplier, you can't deny her
This MC for hire, he gaze, desire
Deep lyrics I spit, tight grips on clips
Making, record ship, at any moment I flip
That sweet touch of my lips, make every track a hit
But how fortunate, are you enjoying this?
I'm pushing bad math, black my hand, smacks the boom bap
Hitting busters, and fake jakes, ya boy's back
Snake eyes, ya ace craps, no one can follow my tracks
Stay mouthful of that...

[Chorus 2X: Makeba Mooncycle]
And girl you know you look def
Getting mad points from the right to the left
Brothers you know you look fly
Getting mad points from the ground to the sky

[Makeba Mooncycle]
Watching you watching me in the belly of the beast, there will be no retreat
By the way, I look sweet, shine from my head to my feet
Making you day complete, the beginning, to end all ends
The creator of trends, like denim
I peeped your man and them, watching my fam and 'em
Your talk look sweet like I'm not watching
You earned 30 points for that shit you be popping
Go on, non stopping, those words you be talking
My lyrics you be hawking, stalking
Sweating on the floor, get you points galore
If a honey passes by, that's minus five
You can party all night, add up your points, right
Keeping everyone in sight before any fist fight
If there's a point spread, you might as well be dead
Don't worry I saw, your up by four

[Chorus 2X]

[Makeba Mooncycle]
Where your man, where your girl?
End the night with a blast, looking
Well I'm looking on the board real fast
Points the plan, rules by guilty and fans
To everyone that pertains, put the name to the game
Upon entering, get mad, fingering
My sense mingling, my aura shimmering
You think, you know you got mad points with this
You get sixty from our points from the lesbian chicks
Who you see me with? Who the fistas you with?
Acting like they want on the relationships
Stop trying to hate, you get a point rebate
But wait, you even get points if you hesitate
Hold up, who's the cutie there off to the side?
He's looking right to my eyes, look at me being fly
No suprise, lips look a little wrinkle, so may I press
Catch my points while I flex

[Chorus 4x]</pre>
