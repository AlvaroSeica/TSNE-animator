[Kangol Slim]
This P-N-C

Now we back once again it's P-N-C
Had you hoes of the heezy with 5th Ward Weebie
Don't forget the Drama Squad and my nigga P.T.
Now we back up on that ass with my girl Ms. Tee
We wanna, see ya girls act wild bra
Where my real Hot Girls on fiyah
To midnight to seventeen to the desire
G-strings in that ass like a wire
South Coast blowin' up for the year 2 g
Kangol Slim is my name as if don't know me
You might know me from the song "Tell Me Why Ya Acting Funny"
But right now, I'ma pass it on to my girl Ms. Tee

[Ms. Tee]
I'ma bend over touch my toes
I'ma humpty, humpty , humpty like them dog hoes
I'ma bend over touch my toes
I'ma humpty, humpty , humpty like them dog hoes
Shake my ass 'til it's gone see what 'cha got
Then boy you can bring it on
I'ma ride that stick to the early morn
Boy you know Ms. Tee got it goin' on
Do you feel the way I feel
No money, no G-string
Let's take it to the bed, I'ma see if you can hang
Hot Girl is who I be, nigga Fa'sho
I'ma wobble de wobble 'til my ass can't shake it no more
Ooo nigga do you got some loot, 
You gone need some money to knock Ms. Tee boots
Ha, you know this bitch is comin' right
It's gonna take ten gee's for you to sleep with me tonight

[5th Ward Weebie-Chorus]
Look at her? She bout to, 
Ah Look at her? She wanna
Look at her? She bout to make a nigga creep up on her
Look at her? She bout to
Ah Look at her? she wanna
Look at her? She bout to make a nigga creep up on her
You can back that ass up girl, do what 'cha do
If you a skinny on a fat girl do what 'cha do
If you a red or black girl do what 'cha do
Ha! Do what'cha do
Ha! Do what'cha do

[Mista Menor]
Shit, watch shorty tear it down
She a pro, she a vet, watch her act a clown
Wobble wit it, wiggle wit it, hit the floor baby
Show 'em how we do it from the N.O. baby
Don't stunt, don't front, show 'em how to pop, and
Raise yo hands up, and show 'em how to Tiddy Bop
Now back it up like a drunk, I take a load off
I would try to take you home, but I'ma hold off
I'm kinda drunk, kinda blowed, kinda throwed off
You gonna make a nigga like me straight go off
I probably would, if I could, but a nigga can't
If you can do this in the club you probably make me faint
Now look at her?

[5th Ward Weebie-Chorus]

[5th Ward Weebie]
If you bend that ass over, spread them cheeks
Back it up Lil' Weebie 'til you touch that D
I ain't gone lie baby girl, I been a freak
If you got that fiyah mouth, then you can hit the streets
Cause I fucked a hoe, fucked a hoe
Hit that pussy, let it go
Look at Lil' Wootay pussy bigger then a dinosaur
5th Ward Weebie, gotta keep you hoes busy
Don't stop twerkin' 'til the song is finished
Now back it up, shake it up
Let me see ya wobble baby
Ooo drop stop it baby
Ooo now drop it baby
Tear it up, turn around make that booty hussle
That thong so tight, I think you bought to pull a muscle
Work the pussy, don't shake it to hard, 
You might hurt the pussy, eyes open to I beat it up, 
'Til I Clutch the pussy, girl put this in yo mouth
That wood so hard, I'm bout to knock yo teeth out

[5th Ward Weebie-Chorus]

[5th Ward Weebie]
If you back that ass up, girl do what 'cha do
If it's All On U, girl do what 'cha do
If you skinny or fat, girl do what 'cha do
Ha! Do what'cha do
Ha! Do what'cha do
Ha! Do what'cha do
Now work the pussy, now work the pussy
Now twerk the pussy, now twerk the pussy
Don't ride the pussy, don't hurt the pussy
Now show the pussy, now serve the pussy
Now wobble on the dick
Ooo swallow that dick
Ooo wobble on a dick
Ooo swallow that dick
Ooo wobble on a dick
Ooo swallow that dick
Ooo wobble on a dick
Ooo swallow that dick
