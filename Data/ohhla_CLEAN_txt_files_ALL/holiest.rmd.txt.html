[Remedy]
Hip-hop's holiest, the white fucking Jew
Who the fuck are you? Yeah, I'm still with the Wu
I always been true, my Killa Bee crew
Far between a few, it flows in my blood, it ain't nothing new
It runs in my veins, the voices, the echoes, the pains
The six million names, never again
Another war nobody won, another song sung
America, eating it's young
Hip-hop's holiest, I declare war
The world's gone sour, all the wrong people got the power
It's evident, like Deck said, we're all Resident
Patients, I make a change like the president
Code Red, never heard a word that I said
And therefore, we savagely beat left for dead
Deleted, erased from the memory, beating and defeated
I pray for the enemy, the Remedy</pre>
