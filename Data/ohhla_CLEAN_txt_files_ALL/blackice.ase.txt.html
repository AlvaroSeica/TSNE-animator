[Black Ice]
I am, beautiful contradiction
Diction and vernacular non-fiction
and spectacular like your favorite neighborhood drama
being narrated by Obama
Baby mama, times three
Rhymes be, drenched in life's experience cinched in strife
and leary since the wolves then I am destined to occupy
Ain't no stoppin by; I live here
Give here my all, possess the gall
and audacity to hope for greater things
Shit, come through my class and see what my young scribes scope for later brings
and then maybe you'll understand +Why This Caged Bird Sings+ for Maya Angelou
Shandaya and Olou{?}
Just a few of my students whose pessimism and prudence make me
stride in the standards 
{*continues on next track "Good Music"*}
created by the vary of my vocabulary...</pre>
