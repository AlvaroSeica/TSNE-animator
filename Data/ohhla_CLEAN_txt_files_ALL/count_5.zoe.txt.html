[Gwen Bunn]
How do you do?
I'm lovely, yes I'm feeling lovely
How are you?
The trees are green and know the sky's a lovely hue
A brighter day for one, but better day for two
Oh, but anytime I'm feeling blue
There is a song I sing and I'll sing it for you
It's kind of tricky, but I know you'll find the groove
Or I could sing the words and you just hum the tune
Oh, yeah

[Chorus: Phonte]
The rain is coming, better get inside
Lay down my love, and count to five
Cause one's too lonely, and three's too soon
Just count to five, and keep your cool

{ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE} {4X}

[Gwen Bunn]
How do you do?
I'm lovely, yes I'm feeling lovely
How are you?
The trees are green and know the flowers are in bloom
A lazy day in May or maybe even June (June)
I know the rain is coming soon
to wash away the day and make it all brand new
Nothing to fear, my dear, I know it to be true
There's so much good in life if you just make the room
Oh, but anytime I'm feelin blue
There is a song I sing and I'll sing it for you
It's kind of tricky, but I know you'll find the groove
Or I could sing the words and you just hum the tune
Oh, ahh...

[Chorus]

{ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE} {4X}
