I tried to beat my felony but I lost that case 
oh well I went to jail and I lost that weight
met a couple dime pieces but I'm true to one women
I can spot a devil with breasts when I see one commin
whats the matter yall actin like yall mad I'm free 
like to see me suferin is what you glad to see
news flash I ain't been doin bad in so long
makin money in prison like I was still at home
Bought a few more vehicals and super size my house 
mad a call to paul wall and he re-did my mouth
I kno you wonder why I'm the most hated rapper down south 
I'm so deep they can reach wut I be talkin about
with the same size foot you couldnt fill these shoes 
you ain't gotta be a crip for you to dig these blues
where the playa haters at 
It's time to hate me again 
same pistol guess take it of safety again 
same slug nose straight 5.7 ain't notin changed 
aint lookin for no trouble just protectin my brain 
dont want me to reach out and touch you
stay outta my way you don't give me a reason
I ain't gonna murder you mayne
I'm the new crack put me on yo hooda and blaze me
you ain't even gotta re-scope jus smoke me daily
if you lookin for a buzz this the wrong CD 
homie don't mis play unless you ready to O.D (flat line)
older people love my musik
they don't think I'm a thug
even little kids listen cause they don't think I'm a drug
in reality I'm an addiction but thats a good thing
not for television I'm a world wide hood thing
record stores and dealers movin my shit 
bootleggers got the good deal but it's too hard to call it quits 
and you got the nerve to call me underground niggas please
here go 14 new songs
overdose on these</pre>
