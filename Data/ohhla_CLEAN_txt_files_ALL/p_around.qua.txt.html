Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
I say the swoop must be tripping
why she hitting my line this early
text messages said she outside
so I closed my blinds and curtains
If she find out another bitch here
I know she going try and hurt me
but deep down you know I don't play that
how the fuck she know where I stay out
she probably asked lisa then they asked around
red had her first then I caught her
so the hoe been passed around
like lights camera action now
boomerang dick she'll be back around
and I call her lil rondo cause she been passed around
I'm ballied down from head to toe
my team winning
bitch check the score
and that blunt on me cause I'm next to blow
and if they don't get what I'm saying
so rerun me
I can't stop dropping these hits
clumsy

[Chorus: x2]
she bad as hell
we pass around
like hot potato
your hoe get passed around
when finished with her
we gone pass her down
call them hoes contagious by the way they getting passed around

[Verse 2]
might bring that chevy to a stop and turn back around
roll the window down and let that chopper pass around
If you ain't from over here we gotta pat you down
I was in houston for a lil minute
now I'm back in town
I say my bitch missed me my mama did too
and it's over with when you get through
with her
and she passed around
make sure you don't kiss that girl
cause I swear she gotta mouth on her
she passed around like a joystick so I played the game
no damien wayne
but when I left I caused major pain
I'm flowing out the same way I came
she passed around but I ain't gone say her name

[Chorus: x4]
she bad as hell
we pass around
like hot potato
your hoe get passed around
when finished with her
we gone pass her down
call them hoes contagious by the way they getting passed around</pre>
