(Verse 1)
(Dr. Dre in background)
[Snoop Dogg] One
             Two
             Three and to the four
             Snoop Doggy Dogg and Dr. Dre is at the door
             Ready to make an entrance, so back on up
[Dr. Dre]    Before I have to pull the strap out the cut
[Snoop Dogg] Gimme the microphone first, so I can bust like a bubble
             Compton and Long Beach together, now you know you in trouble
             Cause it ain't nothin' but a G thang, baby
             Two loc'ed out G's, so we're crazy
             Death Row is the label that pays me
             Unfadeable, so please don't try to fade this, but, uh (Hell yeah!)
             Back to the lecture at hand
             Perfection is perfected, so I'm a let em understand
             From a young G's perspective
             And before me, dig out a trick, I have to find a contraceptive
             You never know she could be earnin' her man
             Learnin' her man
[Both]       And at the same time, burnin' her man
[Snoop Dogg] Now what you burnin', I'm a chill for a minute
             Cause ain't no lovin' good enough to get burnt while I'm in it
[Dr. Dre]    Yeah
[Snoop Dogg] And that's realer than Real-Deal Holyfield
             And now you hookers and hoes know how I feel
             Well, if it's good enough to get broke off a proper chunk
             I'll take a small piece of some of that funky stuff

Break 1:
[Both]       It's like this and like that and like this and uh
             It's like that and like this and like that and uh
             It's like this and like that and like this and uh
[Snoop Dogg] Dre, creep to the mic like a phantom

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
Well, I'm peeping, and I'm creeping, and I'm creepin'
But I damn near got caught
Cause my beeper kept beeping
Now it's time for me to make my impression felt
So sit back, relax, and strap on your seatbelt
You never been on a ride like this before
with a producer who can rap and control the maestro
At the same time with the dope rhyme that I kick
You know, and I know
I flow some ol' funky ssshhh (Yeah)
To add to my collection
The selection
Symbolizes dope
Take a toke
But don't choke
If you do
You'll have no clue
On what
Me and my homey Snoop Dogg came to do

Break 2:
[Both]       It's like this and like that and like this and uh
             It's like that and like this and like that and uh
             It's like this
[Dr. Dre]    Then we ain't got no love for those
[Snoop Dogg] So just chill
             Til the next episode

{*Dr. Dre scratching funk beats*}

[Verse 3: Snoop Doggy Dogg]
Fallin' back on that ass
With a hellafied gangsta lean
Gettin' funky on the mic like a old batch of collard greens
It's the capital S, oh yes, I'm fresh, N-Double O-P
D-O-Double G-Y, D-O-Double G, ya see
Showin' much flex when it's time to wreck a mic
Pimpin' hoes and clockin' a grip like my name was Dolomite
Yeah
And it don't quit
I think they in the mood for another one of those G hits

[Snoop Dogg] So Dre
[Dr. Dre]    What up, Dogg?
[Snoop Dogg] We gotta give 'em what they want
[Dr. Dre]    What's that, G?
[Snoop Dogg] We gotta break 'em off somethin'
[Dr. Dre]    Hell yeah
[Snoop Dogg] And it's gotta be
             Bumpin', city of Compton

[Verse 4: Dr. Dre (Snoop Doggy Dogg)]
It's where it takes place, so when asked, yo' attention
Mobbin' with Tha Dogg Pound (Bow wow wow)
Droppin' the funky tracks that's makin' the suckers just mumble
When I'm on the mic, it's like a cookie, they all crumble
Try to get close, and your bound to get smacked
My little homey Snoop Doggy Dogg has got my back
Never let me slip, cause if I slip, then I'm slippin'
But if I got my nina, then you know I'm straight trippin'
And I'm a continue to
Put the rap down, put the mack down
And if you women talk trip
I'll have to put the smack down
Yeah
And ya don't stop
I told you I'm just like a clock, when I tick and I tock
But I'm never off, always on, to the break of dawn
C-O-M-P-T-O-N, and the city they call
Long Beach
Puttin' it straight together
Like my homey D.O.C.
"No One Can Do It Better"

[Both]       Like this, that and this and uh
             It's like that and like this and like that and uh
             It's like this
[Dr. Dre]    Then we ain't got no love for those
[Snoop Dogg] So just chill
             Til the next episode
