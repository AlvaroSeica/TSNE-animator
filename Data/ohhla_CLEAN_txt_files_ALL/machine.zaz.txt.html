Lost in all the movements and the illusions
The music produces clues for your confusion
Choosing self improvement over amusement
A victim of the abuse and a loner secluded
Proving it's a matter of exclusion ruthless
Computed solutions not conducive to the blueprint
Foolish to question all the views that you've been
Sold as truth since a youth with a toothless grin
Acute and obtuse our disputes within
Seduced by the noose of loose change
and the pursuit of skin
In the end we all lose but who wins?
Is the proof enough
to refute where these roots begin?
But the roof is caving in an excuse to cling
Everything done for a cost and the usual grin
We salute the wind before suits that pretend
They're on our path with class
dilute with loot what we defend
Give me your shine cling tight mine mine mine
Cause time, time will never let go
Imagine you could rewind and remind your mind
To find meaning in the things you forget you know
Define feelings you confine possess and control
The blind healing what's maligned reflect the whole
So never fold it's a role complex and cold
Behind it all there's a soul your blessed to hold

Life is ups and life is downs but I
Understand what I'm living for now
When you feel your dreams come apart at the seams
Wear your heart on your sleeves
Don't be a part of the machine

Nowhere to turn for support of course
A victim of loss divorce and we gloss the source
Families forced to ignore the remorse
Acting like lines were never crossed
and short right before they abort
Right before they distort you need to breathe
Think a stork and greed are what it takes to succeed
And make it work
before the bottle swallows your dreams
Hollow followers rest in pieces of the machine
so recognize when you're struck you bleed
You fill a cup find and the crutch you need
so you clutch and grieve
Never enough so you puff the trees
Rush to feed on anything to crush the disease
Saying please get me doped up,
call hopes bluff till the ropes tied too tight
To be alright and your throats shut
Everything blown up in their face while you post up
Laughing over the end of it all give a toast to love
You fucking dying or what?
Living forever a must
Who's got it better than us?
Let's let their rhetoric touch
Our very essence and flood
until we're drowning in bucks
Until we're found in the trash
with hands slashed and cut
for mention, attention learning a lesson?
or self reflection?
without discretion? lack of direction?
lack of invention? so reckless?
Nothing invested?
Fuck it
what's meant to be is
never meant to be prevented

Life is ups and life is downs but I
Understand what I'm living for now
When you feel your dreams come apart at the seams
Wear your heart on your sleeves
Don't be a part of the machine</pre>
