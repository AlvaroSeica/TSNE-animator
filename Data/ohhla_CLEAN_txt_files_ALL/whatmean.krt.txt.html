[Chorus: Big K.R.I.T.]
What you mean you ain't nasty? Why the fuck you came?
Why the fuck you came? Why the-why the fuck you came?
What you mean you ain't nasty? Why the fuck you came?
Don't you see the grill, candy on the frame?
What you mean you ain't nasty? Why the fuck you came?
Why the fuck you came? Why the-why the fuck you came?
What you mean you ain't nasty? Why the fuck you came?
Don't be pushing on my buttons, wait a minute motherfucker

[Big K.R.I.T.]
Bout time niggas seen the real
Old school car with the grill
Candy doors, valet can't help you up out it
Top fell off and ain't shit I could do about it
Ride clean, every day's a holiday
Getting paid, every day's a bottle day
And you ain't seen a pimp until you seen me on the corner
Last time your bitch chose me, but I ain't want her
Get money, motherfuck fame
Tryna break a hoe and make change
If you knew me from the ribbit, then you knew that I was tipping
You's a motherfucking liar if I ain't repping Mississippi
What you know about it? Krizzle still cold on 'em
My gift of gab came with a bow on it
So if you riding and you down for the smashing
So what you mean, what you mean, what you mean?

[Chorus]

[Big K.R.I.T.]
Don't you wanna rest off in this glass house?
If I let you ride, set that ass out
Don't play me like no trick, that shit's so overrated
All this super bassing, woofer quaking got you motivated
Haters screaming favors never stopped me
Su-su-sucker motherfuckers never blocked me
Popping trunk, dropping top as I beat the bass
If you don't know what K.R.I.T. mean by now, then bitch you super late
Po-po-pour another four up to recuperate
If pimping is a Bloodsport, I kick it like a Kumite
Working boppers on the field like it's two-a-day
Three-a-day, four-a-day, any day a pro say
Shake it for a player, let me see it
If you looking for a southern country bumpkin, let me be it
You say you riding and you down for the smashing
So what you mean, what you mean, what you mean?

[Chorus]

[Ludacris]
Luda~! I knew a bitch named Mandy, she was a pink toe
She had a lisp, so I asked her could she deep throat?
Said she'd never done it, she said she'd never tried
She's sitting there telling a motherfucking lie
I said baby don't you worry, just get down on your knees
cause some warm head will turn me up a couple degrees
So just throw your lips around this anaconda and squeeze
and you'll keep a nigga harder than some government cheese
I say all women are freaks, they just need an excuse
Pretending they all tight when these bitches is loose
That's why I stay strapped up when I'm knocking the boots
and love that military pussy, I just need some recruits (troops, a-ten-hut!) 
Salute a pimp, yeah it's Luda-pimp
Bad bitches join my team, ugly hoes exempt
After midnight don't play no motherfucking games
cause if you do, all you gon' hear me say is

[Chorus]</pre>
