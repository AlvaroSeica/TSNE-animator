[Chorus 2X: Crunch Lo]
Form like Voltron, niggas scatter like fleas
The white flag's raised, niggas down to they knees
Towns get Pillaged, the goods get seized
This is the result of young bucks and O.G.'s

[Crunch Lo]
I handle mics tight, like a nine beretta
Two on the hip, with the vest under the sweater
Under pressure for my squeeze, get wet like mint leaves
We want all the dough, the gwop and cream cheese
Nigga please, this is sweat from my wreck
Throw ya bets on the ground, I show you how I get down
The go-head cracker trips, four-five and six
This is Ill Bill shit, not a Kill Bill skit
So get low, when I spit with aim
I'm untamed, hit you dead, in the middle of your frame
It's all rock a Benign, throw a wrench in ya scheme
Yo, it's Crunch Lo, a crew of all up in your dreams
Rugers with beams, in a dusty ass mossberg
Jet it in your mouth, you had a loss for words
I ain't the herb, wrong dude for that

[Lounge Lo]
It's been a long time coming since you heard from kid
I'm back on the grind, this is how much work I did
Sat back, listen to cats and I heard them flow
While I was hustling, trying to get them birds to go
You know my Fam to the O, Crunch Lo, Molly and Wigs
And Lord Mike, getting the gwop for Ghost
I toast to that, niggas know I'm close with Cap
Bang for the kid, stay tight like I'm closing the gap
We not friends, man, we closer than that, so close, we blood
So how you thought we cross over them gats?
I keep blams on a hostler rack, and I ain't talking bout boy
When I screamed out the poster's back
I'm talking bout L.O.Bizzy, easy, dog
You can catch me on the V.Z., breezing the fog
With some niggas that'll peach you off, you know the type
That get money, and walk in the streets of New York

[Interlude: Crunch Lo]
Yeah, O.T.F., ya'll niggas know what it is
Nigga, we got eleven years in the gri-ind, what?

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
