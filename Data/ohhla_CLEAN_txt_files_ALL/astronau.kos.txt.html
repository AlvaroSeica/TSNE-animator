Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Neil Armstrong]
That's one small step for man
One giant leap for--

[k-os]
huh.. hip hop is an astronaut
oh, doin' my thing
made for rap seeds like catamaran
and I gotta crush on a girl sang delang
built MC like Sook Yun Yang
slang by slang is austracious
Slipping and trip is Ellen Page is
So contagious so courageous
Goodness gracious let me say this
that, it's my time breaking through
Tip the clock it's clicking too
Cook the pizza flavour brew
Like my man says "aus nien too"
In the bar individual this is indivdual
this is for you
All them haters take you to say this?
Like batman, I punched him out
POW!

You keep it pumpin'
You better pick someobody
You should be cool about it (and bring peace, yo)
You better pick someobody
You better pick someobody to get to know

What's up girl?
Nothin'
What you doin'
Just here chillin'
Can I drop this?
Go ahead babe

I wish those kids watch Hannah Barbara
I wish another me like Teagan and Sara
I wish I had a girl who looked like Farah Fawcett
Pause it, what in min the closet
I once fell in love with a girl named Lauren
Once I got ta Lauren all the girls were foreign
And then I went away and when away on tour, and
When I came back she had a boyfriend
and I said "Yo, L will you marry me, will you take me to the alter and destiny"
And she said "I'm not down with the groupie scene and all these girls are beauty queens"
Oh man thats what you see on the surface
I wouldn't have popped the question if you didn't deserve it
When they act all high profile they are all nervous
so fellas that is why I drink POW!

You better think about it
And let it flow
You better think about it
You better think about it
You better pick someobody to get to know

I'm slowing down thoughts to the point of oberservation
I came from galaxy to represent this hip hop nation
I'm kickin' the same ol game no name fame
The astroplane is ordained
Play on!
Takes us to the break of dawn
Evaporation, I'm gone

You better think about it
And let it flow
You better think about it
You better think about it
and get to knowÂ…

Now dance with me!

You better think about it
You better think about it
about it
about it</pre>
