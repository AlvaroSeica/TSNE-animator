[Chorus: Amy Winehouse]
Where is he? The man who was just like me
I heard he was hiding, somewhere I can't see
Where is he? The man who was just like me
Heard he was hiding, somewhere I can't see
And I'm alone and I realize that when I get home
I wanna go to my red and my Cherry
Yes I'm alone and I realize when I get home
I wanna go to my red and my Cherry
 
[Nas]
I want someone who like the champagne I like, my a-alike
Someone to talk me off the bridge any day or night
She teach me how to live, she ain't afraid of life
Not easily impressed with the rich and famous life
cause she done been there and heard all the rumors before
She love art, she ride out with me on my music tour
She like the herb's natural medicine, she cookin good
She tell me everything is cool when it ain't lookin good, f'real 
The world so ill, yo I want a girl so real
who not after material wealth but get dough still
Or maybe an educator, a lady with etiquette
Who can be from out the hood or either work for the President
As long as theres no selfishness
Yes, as long as her love for the people is deep-rooted and evident
You can be easily recruited, you're heaven sent
Your smile, put me at ease
You're the woman I need, but where is she?
 
[Chorus]
 
[Nas]
I hate when people write me hostile texts on account of my lifestyle's perception
Invade my personal life? Out of the question 
What are they expecting? I be tryin to reply 'em
They never suppose I get my quiet time in?
They think forever I'm rollin in dough, swimmin in a pool of cash
God, wouldn't they know, or am I a fool or ass?
I'm well-known, got people comin at me mad
I had to tell homes, "I dont keep a cell phone, my bad"
I drag off the L and try to silence it
The noise in my head, the curse of the talented
Strong communicator, vagabond
I gallivant around the equator, and that would get me off the radar
It's so intense, I'm on my Lilo and Stitch
Pour my Pinot Grigio and Cris with some lime yo, it's this
An immaculate version of "Me and My Bitch" by Biggie
With all respect cause you the only one who gets me
 
[Chorus]
 
[Interlude: Nas]
Yeah, yeah.. 
Let's pour some cherry wine
Everything's good, everything's fine
Yeah, yeah we bring it every time
Yeah, pour a lil' cherry wine
Yeah, aiyyo Salaam 
Yeah, I think they know the time
Everything's good, everythings fine
Yeah, you pour a little cherry wine, yeah
Life is good... Life is good!.. Yeah
Life is good... No matter what, life is good... 
Life is good... Life is good! Yeah
Life is good... No matter what, life is good
 
[Amy Winehouse] 
A-Where is he? The man who was just like me
I heard he was hiding, somewhere I can't see
Where is he? The man who was just like me
Heard he was hiding, somewhere I can't seeeee..
I'm alone and I realize that when I get home
I wanna go to my red and my Cher-ry
Yes I'm alone and I realize that when I get home
I wanna go to my red and my Cherry
OH oh oh oh-oh-oh-oh oh, na-na-na-na-naaaah
Ohh-oooh-whoooa-wha-ah-dah oh-oh, ah-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee
Oh, oh, no, no, no-no-no-no, nah da-dee-dee
A-rub-a-dee-dee-dee, bub-a-dee-dee-dah-da-doo-doo-dah
Do, do, do, do, ah-huh ohhh no
Oh oh oh oh oh, oh no no no no~!
No-no-no-no... The man who was just like ME!
I heard he was hiding, somewhere I can't see
And I'm alone, and I realize that when I get ho-ome
When I wanna go to my red and my Cherry-ie, yeaah oh oh oh
Mmm, The man who was just like me
I heard he was hiding, somewhere I can't seeeeee...
And I'm alone and I realize when, I get home
that I wanna go to my red and my Cher-ry!
