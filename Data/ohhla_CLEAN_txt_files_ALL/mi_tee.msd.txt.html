[Verse 1]
Yo I'm that same little girl that grew up next door to you 
Went through all the things a teenage girl goes through 
Hangin' out all night and breaking my curfew 
When my daddy hit the door I gave my mumma the blues 
Use to spend my time blazin' lazin' days away 
Thought I was grown left home at 15 didn't wanna obey 
Had to get my act together couldn't take the heat 
And now I'm makin' beats for the streets 

[Chorus]
I'm Ms Dy-na-mi-tee 
I stay blowin' up your stereo 
I'm just Ms Dy-na-mi-tee 
Everybody gotta hear me you 
Hear me bussin' on the radio 
Now feel my flow you get me though 
I'm Ms Dy-na-mi-tee 

See me bouncin' in the video 
And I come to rock the show 
I'm Ms Dy-na-mi-tee 
Everybody loose control 
Let my vibe 2uch your soul 

[Verse 2]
I remember all the house parties that took place 
Bein' in my bed upstairs and we could still feel the base 
And my cousins and my brothers we'd sit up all night 
Listenin' to my family vibin' till the mornin' light 
Remember my first yeasrs of school I was so Innocent 
I just wanted to learn I never been so content 
But the more that I learned I found a guidin' light 
That showed me the need to flight 
And be 

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
At 13 I thought that I was in love with this guy 
Anytime I caught his eye I thought that I'd just die 
Remember playin' class clown I was just a disruptive fool 
And the beatin' that I got first time suspended from school 
Remember Sunday School and after go to grammas for lunch 
Macaroni, rice and peas, chicken and pineapple punch 
Never had much my mum brother sister and me 
But love was enough to succeed to grow 

[Chorus]</pre>
