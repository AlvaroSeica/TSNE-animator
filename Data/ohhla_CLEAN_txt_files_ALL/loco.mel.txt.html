[Intro]
Good fuckin morning, nigga
Wake the fuck up
It's four o'clock man, c'mon

[Hodgy Beats]
Pigs raid my crib, I'm feelin like Fred Hampton
I got firearms under my mattress, campin
Yo, I'm from the ghetto where there's special enhancements
Niggaz begin to shootin don't, get second chances
Banana clips conceal wimps, hit 'em 'til they feel sweat
Beat these pred-day and night states bitch I'm a real threat
Besides the drug movement, move with all the socially Socialists
And we hangin'by the rope and shit, we give each other hope like gifts
Though I'm a Nigga With an Attitude
Drinking, aiming at your dude - scary huh? You bladder fooled
Hinderant doctor, with a militant posture
Bearing arms like an octo smoke killer weed, killer Rasta
At the lamppost in Oakland next to Bob Seale
My heart don't beat, fuck the heartthrob feel... I said
I said, my heart don't beat, fuck the heartthrob feel

[Interlude]
It's not just you
I hate everybody, God damn

[Hodgy Beats]
Man I tell them boys catch up, catch up, ketchup, ketchup
Odd Future Wolf hun Gang put them Tecs up
One shot, one kill, Tyrane never mess up
Take more than a fuckin lie detector to fess up
Mustard, mustard, mustard, mayo
Odd Future grand Gang music and the llello
Anthrax packaged to the door, in potato
Call me Hammerhead, cause I mash him like he Play-Doh
I'm a rat, nigga where the cheese at?
I'm goin after stacks, nigga where them G's at?
Matter fact, honey where dem B's at?
And all them niggaz with them A-B-C hats
I'ma take y'all back to school; you fuckin dropout
Who work a fuckin 9 to 5 just to cop out
I'm on the block nigga, not when the cops out
Keys open doors and you the motherfucker locked out

[Outro]
Bitch
Wolf Gang, MellowHype, "BlackenedWhite"
Killing y'all niggaz
Don't fuck with Odd Future bitch</pre>
