Typed by: AZ Lyrics

1 a.m. in the back of the club
(Just me and you girl)
I know it's wrong but
But you can't take it no longer so we're
Lookin' for a little love
But in all the wrong places
And we're both a little wasted
Been drinkin' Nuvo all night
I don't know...
I don't know...
How I let it get this far
Out of control, out of control slow dancin' in the dark
Under the strobe lights, there we are
Runnin' 'round town wit' somebody else girl
See I know it's hard
Both know maybe me and you should...
Slow down
'Cause girl you're just so sexy every thing that you do its makin' me want you
Right now...
See I just came here to chill but
Now I'm with the dangerous girl gettin...

Kisses in the V.I.P.
Climbin' all on top of you
And you on top of me, we're doin...
Things that I just can't believe
One hands holdin' ya face
Other hands holdin' ya waist
Girl this can't be right
What are we doin', we don't care
If somebody sees
What are we doin', we don't care
'Cause we both receive
Kisses in the V.I.P.
When it feels this right it must be wrong
Listen, we can't go on

You see it's like...
I'm sorry.
We just can't...
Hold on! Stop, stop, stop!
You gon' get lipstick on my shirt.
Everything feels (upside down)
You know like, my whole world feels (upside down)
Yeah, listen...

2 a.m. and the club 'bout to close
Still me and you girl
Now we're slow dancin'
Low lights make it romantic and you
Want me to take you home
Believe me I'm tempted but...
Ain't really into pimpin'
And I gotta good girl who loves me
Slow down
Let's just take it step by step
Think it over, let's not rush into this
Now...
We're blinded by our passion
and we don't know what happened
Because we're gettin...

Kisses in the V.I.P.
Climbin' all on top of you
And you on top of me, we're doin...
Things that I just can't believe
One hands holdin' ya face
Other hands holdin' ya waist
Girl this can't be right
What are we doin', we don't care
If somebody sees
What are we doin', we don't care
'Cause we both receive
Kisses in the V.I.P.
When it feels this right it must be wrong
You know why we can't go on

I don't know how it ended up like this
Someone who...
I was never suppose to touch
Became my strongest desire
And now...
Here we are
All this people
All these lights
All these drinks
Everybody's havin' fun
And all I can do is look into your eyes
And...
I know it's not right
Don't come home with me, no
You need to go home to him
I know you, I know you wanna come baby but you need to go home because...
We can't do this
Yeah, nah, well...
Well call me when you leave then
And we'll...
When you get to your car
Yeah, yeah, yeah, just call me when you get to the car
Make sure you safe y'know

What am I gon' do...</pre>
