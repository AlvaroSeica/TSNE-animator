Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro/Chorus]
yea when the pressures on
yea when the pressures on
yea when the pressures on
yea when the pressures on
what you gonna do when the pressure's on?
I'm a post up in the club with my necklace on
and I'm a go hard till they exit me holmes
and I'm a bounce right back if they let me go
what you gonna do when the pressures on?
I'm a post up in the club with my necklace on
and I'm a go hard till they exit me holmes
and do the whole ten years if they catch me on

[Verse 1]
see it's matter over mind grind over matter
If you stay focused on yours nigga mine shouldn't matter
y'all make way I think that's boys bout to fall
just to let you know if I slip then I'm falling on y'all
It's my ? I ain't sorry I ain't never seed that we can go see Maury
listen here hoe see you're playing with a g
tell 'em put a stack on it I got a million on me
young going hard started readying this bitch
wouldn't fuck that with another mans dick
young and two real of these hoes too silly
drop one on one and I go millie
push your bus pipes? oh is that what they say?
oh no you might wanna bring it back dj
make you wanna get money play it at your own risk
I can show what to do you gotta use your own wrist
when the pressures on

[Chorus]
what you gonna do when the pressues on?
I'm a post up in the club with my necklace on
and I'm a go hard till they exit me holmes
and I'm a bounce right back if they let me go
what you gonna do when the pressures on?
I'm a post up in the club with my necklace on
and I'm a go hard till they exit me holmes
and do the whole ten years if they catch me on

[Verse 2]
when there's so many chippers saying I'm running outta time
guess I'm ain't the only one that lost my mind
y'all done lost your mind y'all bump your head
make sure I remember that when I'm counting my bread
got me all up on my swagger me acting like a rapper
hear the words scramble and talking like a trapper
kill you like this homie this is how it is
call lollywood nigga this is how I live
fuck what ya heard young to like living
came from the bottom so I know that feeling
sure had a grind when I ain had sauce
you can try and judge me y'all go head on
hit ya a grind when I had no hits
you know I had to grind when I had no kicks
It came from the west they ain't gave me shit
what's with kayne west he can't tell me shit
when the pressures on

[Chorus]
what you gonna do when the pressure's on?
I'm a post up in the club with my necklace on
and I'm a go hard till they exit me holmes
and I'm a bounce right back if they let me go
what you gonna do when the pressures on?
I'm a post up in the club with my necklace on
and I'm a go hard till they exit me holmes
and do the whole ten years if they catch me on

[Verse 3]
when I'm in the street I ain't like what I'm hearing
word on the street they ain't like what I'm steering
oops my bad let me take it back
pull back up in that black on black
let's all tell it it was over back then
catch a nigga see man all I do is win
I never lose if I lose I lost
I can't tell ya how much just know I paid the cost
that's why young's the boss nigga ow ow
still setting off motherfucker pow pow
paid my dues and I kept my receipts
y'all be about be the reasons I ain't getting sleep
young applied pressure and stays on your neck
take two nigga I been had it on deck
so roll up my igga that's excessive and a fact
and when you're jammin my shit that's excess in your deck
when the pressures on... </pre>
