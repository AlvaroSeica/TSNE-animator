[Usher]
Baby let me have the way I was thinking I could get it again
Maybe we can be friends if your lonely (loneliness)
Baby show me just so we get tired you can stay we can ride off in the wind
Tell me well did you know (did you know)
I'm thinking which way we can go
I should have known your treating me own girl
(only the red light cause control)
I gotta be dreaming cause I never felt like this before

[Chorus]
You were supose to be just a one night (one night)
One more time and I'm out the door (Hey)
You just got me sitting here at the red light (looking crazy)
Driving round looking out for her (for her)
It was supposed to be (supposed to be)
Just a one night (one night)
One more time and I'm out the door (the door)
So I'm just sitting here at the red light (looking crazy)
driving out looking out for her

Yeah!

[Ludacris]
She had a coke bottle shack really big booty small waist
I feel a little yozzy cause I really wanna see her face one more (let's go)
That woman's got me messed up in my head I forgot about my thought
and what I said all I could remember is one night more then (yea)
one hour on one floor (yea break it down)
There was one red light by the bed
that was glowing of her skin when I did my thang
We was dripping with a little bit of sweat and a whole lot of lost
Cause I really most of diggin her friend
All I wanna say is that we handle ours
and there ain't too many women that could handle stars
And what I wouldn't just one more time
for the chance to grip their handle bars

(Let's go)

[Chorus]
You were supposed to be just a one night (one night)
One more time and I'm out the door (Hey)
You just got me sitting here at the red light (looking crazy)
Driving round looking out for her (oh crazy)
It was supposed to be (supposed to be)
Just a one night (one night)
One more time and I'm out the door (the door)
So I'm just sitting here at the red light (At the red light)driving out
looking out for her

Looking out for her!</pre>
