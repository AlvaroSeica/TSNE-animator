[Phonte]
Here is where we say a whole lotta
bad things that we don't mean
You think it's either right or wrong
There's noooo in-between
I don't feel like a fight to day, so I, just keep movin on
(I'm goin to the studio, I'll be back..)
Feel free to take this as you please
But I'm still coming home

[Chorus 2X]
Al-waaaays, com-innnng, home to yoooou..
(It don't have to be so all or nothing!)
Al-waaaays, com-innnng, home to yoooou..
(It don't have to be so all or nothing!)

[overlaps the chorus second time; repeat 2X]
Say you love me (Say you love me)
Say you love me (Say you love me)
Say you love me (Say you love me)
Say you love me, sugar!
