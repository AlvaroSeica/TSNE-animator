I've been puttin in work since Jody Breeze was wearin pampers
I got jumped as a teen, couldn't part with my Starters
Wasn't shit to me all he did was make me harder
Fuck throwin sticks and stones now we totin guns and bricks
I've been representin like this since Lil Kim was suckin dick

stay down grindin til I get my boyz out the hood
