[Bronze Nazareth]
Born inside these notes just trying to make it
Kingdom of kush, Push can inside my blood plate-less
Daddy brought me home, he was bulletproof
Spray shots at those Vietcong troops
I was a sickly child in and out of hospitals
Granddad's home and welfare cheese made it possible
Picked us up from Grandma's she was drunk
How could you pass these years without Malcolm's jewels
Shit, Cracking bottles on the pavement
As I pass like Dandelion wine in Granddaddy's basement
I walk a lonely strole, While Clayton threw glass at Mom's skull
Until her and Lynn jetted, Mom's with an ebony prince fetish
I grew to match with fatigues, And fuck a factory
That's about the same time G's Pop passed away
We hugged on the porch and laughed the pain away
Lonely times, It was three of us inside the same mind
Damn life is like a land mine, Just living is tragic
Told you Pops jumped out of helicopters made it through mad shit
I found his Pendergrass in the attic, Now I'm an addict
While cancer grew in his throat like Granddad's did
Shit, I never seen screws so tight
I saw the first stream of my Dad's tears at night
While us cousins just dreamt on dream pipes
While us cousins we dreamt on dream pipes
I'm still scared of those mean nights
That's why he watching videos in the back room
My Mom went to Vidal Sassoon, Hair combed and groomed
Dad sat on a picnic table on family reunions
Down by the beach we would be fooling
Tyler Williams slammed me in the backyard
Now they slammed him in his graveyard too hard
Karam made it far with his brave heart
Wish I could trade art for time
Wish I could take them bullets out of Sean's spine
And play lineback about four years in time
What a waste of life, And this is life that you couldn't see
Until you put my shoes on and walk with me, Peace</pre>
