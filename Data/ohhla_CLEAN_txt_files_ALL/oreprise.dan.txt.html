Danny! wound up in the wrong crowd
after finding himself unable to resist temptation
Even though all the older folks had groomed him up to be the leader
His back was against the wall and he was hustlin in a major way
and eventually he was gon' have to face that music
I remember when the trial was approaching, I was writing him letters
just to let him know I was on his side no matter what
But I also let him know, "Ay, you got ta tighten up yo' act"
I knew he looked up to me so I hope he would take my words to heart
and I knew they were all love
I never knew if he actually recieved the letters or not
cause eventually I just stopped haring back from him
Danny! began to spiral out of control
and I started to really worry about him
I really really did...</pre>
