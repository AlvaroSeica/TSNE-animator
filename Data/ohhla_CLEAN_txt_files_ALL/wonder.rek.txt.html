[Verse 1]
Yeah, check
I used to contemplate an escape from reality
Face the mirror, state "I hate you waste of space"
The taste of Henny chased by more Henny
Me and my inebriated state needed fate, fate would have it
I'd go on to make "Say Goodnight," take a flight
NY City see me in the booth where they created "Nas is Like"
How does life take us from them drunkest nights to the heights
Minus plights and minus the cares, can't forget them wonder years
Years where I wondered where next meal provided
Decided to try my hand again, now we find Reks with Hi-Tek
A gem hidden in the dirt, eternally reflecting, and first
From the worst thirst to throat quenched, make no sense
To convince me I can't make it there, make it here, make it anywhere
From wonder years, yes I profess I from projects to high-rise rised
All of them doubts defied, now back to cloud nine

[Chorus]
'Cause all the days that I spent, getting wasted
Listening to my instrumentals
I ain't have no pay for the rent, not one red cent
Wondering what I'm in the game for
'Cause it gets cold, be low-low
low-low-low-low-low-low-low
Oh, the things I've done for my meal
Thank God I made it through the wonder years

[Verse 2}
Had my first taste of Heaven at the age of eleven
Took a drink with the reverend, I ain't lying
Uncle was on the drugs, fast forward, Corey swerving in the fast lane
Buzzing, bugging and blacked out when the crash came
Couple bumps and bruises but fuck a scratch, mane
Whip's in the ditch, and my wife, she gon' trip, fam
This around the time I was flipping penny, nickel, dime shit
Not by design, kid, I was tripping
All the signs said dead, jail, or fallen friend
I was homeless and O took me in, fed a nigga
Betcha niggas seen me in the bean looking bummy, same jeans
A week straight, ain't offer a plate, ya nah mean?
And it's funny how they love me now, knew I'd always make it out
Pats on backs, daps or pounds, simmer down, fucking clowns
On top, they love you, the bottom, nobody cares
Grey Hairs now, looking back on wonder years, yeah

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Reks savage, blessed at this, forget rappers
I'm next as if I got my ticket to get package
FedEx the walking papers, matchmaker meant marriage
Stalling my life, a wife and carriage
Daddy Day Care, oh yeah, I changed diapers
Still pencil lines that change your life up like the D.C. sniper
Last of the freedom writers, my vice of life the cigs and alcohol
Add up all my headaches, I said I'm in the finish having a ball
I'm sure you missed a Tylenol, to reference the wilder y'all
Left stage, bartender hollering final call
Gotta get my drink on, it help me get my think on
On beats I can get Talib Kweli deep on
Back to the wonder years, younger kids, Transformer underwears
Under influence of a movement brewing in the Bronx
Doing what we want, latchkey child, my past was wild
Lend me your ears for them wonder years, yeah
