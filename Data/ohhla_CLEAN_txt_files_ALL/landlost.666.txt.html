[Chorus]
Deep down south in da hood niggas slang
Hustlin' and game 
Tryin ta stack some change 
Land of tha Lost Full of Gangstas n killas 
Niggas all about they damn scrilla   &gt;

[Gangsta Boo]
To start it off I'm the motherfuckin lady about her cheese
While you other Herman Benz out there leavin fo' free
Kinda quick to tell you what I'm gonna get and it be true 
At the end of the rainbow nigga I thought you knew
Cause Im sayin all my hustlas dont forgot im on the green 
got a pocket full of money not no stones know what I mean?
Dont get mad cause yo ass livin broke 
Fuck that get up off yo lazy ass
Get about yo fuckin scratch
 
[?????]
I'm chasin Franklin wit' my Triple 6 thugs 
Cause we was sinners 
I get deeper I'm still comin up with lint
Livin in a tent some trick gotta change
it aint the same 
And its plain to see I ain't the same man
Beat a bitch, Rob a hoe 
Kick in does from doe to doe 
Prophet posse never sloppy 
Clean you out from roof to flo'
I'm startin to stinkin' raisin my heartbeat
to never be rich
Rather trade a hoe for mackers dis predemption

&gt;

[Juicy J]
It's on! Why you shakin whatcha wanna do
I gotta 357 brand new shootin holes through
Niggas skulls fool Lets get da dope and drop it off
and count them G's and smoke some cheese 
it pays to brake the law
My cousin creepin all them graded boys gonna hook us up
to make a grip on that white shit that we dont see or touch
Fuck what you talkin about? We slangin Nigga
By any means you wanna stop the team we pull the Trigga

[Koopster Knicca]
Red Red Go away! Cause a nigga wanna play
Leave me here, chiefin hey
Standin till the last day; You can
let me wear a briefcase in my situation
So many smilin faces about the devil that's in me racin'
Place in here's a motherfucker my nigga I tell ya what
When I was in the jail while my killa was in da cut 
all because of this high powered, coward
Bustin that I heat up musta been in love, wanna fill me with slugs

[Crunchy Black]
Its Crunchy Black Crunchy Black
on da creep nigga
how you niggas out here gonna laugh and fuckin giggle?
when im gettin bigga and bigga 
Bigga den a fuckin picture
Picture me in yo dreams when im out, ta fuckin getcha
hit ya fo' ya dividends and fled from da fuckin case
Dont drop no peices so I, want catch a case
make a mistake in dis game and man youll hafta pay
Deep in the jail cell or holy cell
never see the day
