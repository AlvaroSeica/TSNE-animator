[Lil Snupe]
Youngin, been about the money
These niggas know 'bout the youngins, these niggas know that I run it
This nigga call me on the phone, and I ain't even want him to sign me
Just knew that he knew my name so it was on
These niggas knew that I was smokin' strong, then
And these niggas already know I was gon' come through in the Benz
These niggas know I don't really even trust my friends
Cause you will commit em homie if we commitin sins
(Hold up! Hold up, tell 'em how you got to Philly!) How I got to Philly, rode on the bus
Greyhound; man I heard I had to lay it down
Nigga in the back cupped up, up in a fuckin seat
But I knew if I got to Meek I was gon' kill the fuckin beat
And could I be a fuckin millionaire, trillionaire
And people look at me, now they say yeah it's really here
These niggas here, we hated y'all, yeah I got the .80 cocked
They tellin me damn boy you ain't in a day top, you ain't in the car
(What you rolled in when you got to Philly?) When I rolled to Philly, I rolled in a Bentley
First nigga sent me my Bentley, this nigga Meek Milly
From my city you don't see shit like that
Yeah it's greatness, this shit right here amazin'
It's crazy to know that I rolled in a Ferrari today
First time ridin in a Ferrari was today
But see me, I'm a do it up in a just major way
But these niggas they tryna take me and nigga I just can't play (what happened last week?)
I'm a youngin, last week we was everywhere
Real shit, nigga we was everywhere
Flew home, Monday had a fight
Nigga we was thuggin, goin hard out all night
Then I had a wreck, man this shit right here is crazy
But I'm a fuckin star, man this life here, it's amazin'
Police didn't come, that shit right there I don't believe
That this that, this shit right here happenin to me
(What happened the next day?) Tuesday I was chillin
Girl named Kiara, I swear to gosh I was killin
She just knew that I was feelin, a young nigga was feelin
And she wanted me cause a nigga was fresh back from Philly
So I was rollin blunts all day
So I had to get it nigga in the hallway
Nigga I already know I was headed to the top
By 9 o'clock pussy ass niggas spinned the block
The same pussy niggas, I had a fight with on Monday
The nigga tryin to kill me, funeral by Sunday
But mama never was gon' have it, mama never was gon' did it
So I had to get it, show these nigga that I believe it
My cousin sayin' "Snupe, wanna ride on these niggas?
Tell me if you really wanna slide on these niggas"
Then Meek text me, said "What would you do?"
Then I said "Man, this shit a test but what should I do?"
He said "Snupe if wanna get him, I'm wit him"
I said "Fuck these niggas, in a year, we gon get em"
I got it right now, I gotta go and get these millions
Told these people that I'm with it so these people gotta get it
These niggas tryna take me to the under, I'm thug
These niggas tryna Twitter beef so they can get some buzz
But me I'm a young nigga, these niggas be with the thugs
And I got niggas when I say so they really will hit you wit slugs
(What happened at the battle?) Happened at the battle, it was 10K
Most money I ever made, 10K
10K, it was crazy man, this shit was winnin
I won fuckin 10k up in 30 minutes
It was an easy battle, I ain't gon lie, it was simple
Pussy nigga had no brain, felt like he was mental
Young nigga comin, these niggas know that we was into
He was rappin like his ass was playin the instrumental
Fuck niggas actin like I ain't been in one
A great nigga, they invented one
Mama and daddy, they had a king for real
Man I swear I'm livin out my people dreams for real
I do my thing right now, my daddy ain't livin' dreams
Mama ain't livin' dreams, granny ain't livin' dreams
My cousins ain't livin' dreams so you know what I'm a do?
I'm a live all out through Snupe, we gonna rock
