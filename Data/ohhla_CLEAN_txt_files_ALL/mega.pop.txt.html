[M. Sayyid]
made out of everything
steady I'm ready
petty rappers
frontin gun clappers
a&amp;r sellin you cars
sellin you stars
round trip ticket to mars
so I picked it apart
spit it, hit it, get it
pivot, swivel and dribble
twist with the sparks
touch this
rush off with crutches
churches and hushes
while I'm rollin dutches
past the ruckers
make a flow in my head
push the clutch

(yo, yo, easy, easy)
(yo, he didn't even use his blinker. what the fuck, man?)

weavin bobbin noddin
I'm keepin features swolen
highten pressure on the hemoglobin
(swollow the nitrate)

[High Priest]
you want your playlist to pop?
put apc at the top
? choppin the pavement, it's toxic
I only spit pure hot, it's the brolic
so what if it's popular
I got to infect you in order to affect you
and I don't expect you go get it at first
my brains burst
sprayin pure freon on celine dion
scream on cats like sam kinison
innocent bystanders swarmin
my thoughts formin
and dormant mcs want to live again

(yo, talk to your man, your man is wild)

ease back, he's that caracter
with disparaging patterns
that manage to damage, I'm famished

mega

[M. Sayyid]
cats trot up with the hate
but I crack back and inflate
smack tracks hack you in eighths
while safari straight primate
when I spit the tape, spit at the fakes
spit it to pivot from snakes

[High Priest]
geeze, for cripe's sake, please give it a break
gotta chop two eights into four bar spaces
my innovation's open faces over the duration
footing the dance with the artform
I put cats in backbraces</pre>
