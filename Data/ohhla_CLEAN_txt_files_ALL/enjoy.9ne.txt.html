[Iintro
You're body don't lie I can tell you've done this before
You're too locked up let me put my key in your door
Put your body all on top of me I want to enjoy

[Chorus]
Sexy sexy enjoy, wont you let me enjoy
[X3]

[Verse 1]
Welcome to my wonderful world of enjoyment
Only go getting sexy women get employment
Full of exuberance behavior is flamboyant
Anyone not drinkin' or smoking' is an annoyance
If you wanna work you can visit me in the cockpit
You wont know you have it when I put you on the hot list
Then I check your body parts makin sure that its spotless
I am the controller so baby just know I got this
Truly elegant sexy for the hell of it
Who you got waitin at the crilla is irrelevant
Need to know the smell of it smellin like the crotch produce spring flower is what I tell the bitch

[Chorus]
Sexy sexy enjoy, wont you let me enjoy
[X3]

[Verse 2]
Bb bc bg bp (baby fat) cc (Chanel) gc (Gucci)
take it off so I can see ya 3d
ya great at extending the bp
oh shit focus, low chicks, hold this (what?)
(hootie and the blow fish, huh?) hocus pocus
imma go in my pocket and pull out a wad of this glock and baby its no trip
And when your shifts over we can be done
or we can pretend you a sleaze no tease
you can check out anytime you like
but you can never leave the need to please

[Chorus]
Sexy sexy enjoy, wont you let me enjoy
[X3]

[Verse 3]
I can see your lips a smilin but its not the ones above
If I enter in ya would you start preachin that its love
You're topless (oh lord) your bottom is too
Kinda crazy what I wanna do to you but OOH (ooh wee)
baby do me, give to me, please let me enjoy

[Chorus]
Sexy sexy enjoy, wont you let me enjoy
[X3]

[Verse 4]
Its not a fantasy (so so real)
Comin uncontrollably
Sexy individual baby lets get physical
Play with you, you are my toy
I want to enjoy</pre>
