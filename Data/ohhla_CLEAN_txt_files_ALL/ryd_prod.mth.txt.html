[Method Man]
Check it

(Verse 1)
Check it
I'm the fuckin' man, who they mention
Notice
That other niggas' rap styles is bogus
Doo-doo
Prepare for this verse, Tical voodoo
Blazin', the stuff that ignites stimulation
Inside ya
Cause I be that house over water
Forgot in the realm that be deep as the Poseidon
Adventure
Niggas need to touch they freaking picture
For the sickness, that be spreadin' with the quickness
Remedies, cousin, I be doin' on my enemies
Penalty
Then I drink forties to they memories
Emotion
Rushin' through your down street vicinity
Blunt smoke, in the air, reveals my identity

Chorus: Method Man
What's that rhythm, what's that sound
Party people getting down
When it hit the baddest man
Just RELEASE
YO DELF

Break 1: Method Man
Keep it movin', baby, we be movin', uh
And keep it movin', you know we keep it movin', uh
Keep it movin', baby, we be movin', uh
And keep it movin', you know we keep it movin', uh
And keep it movin', baby, we be movin', uh
And keep it movin', you know we keep it movin', uh
And keep it movin', baby, we be movin', uh
And keep it movin', you know we keep it move
RHARHHH

(Verse 2)
God
Somebody said, "It's on," if it isn't, I'll be set
To blow a nigga up
With my five fingers of death
I bring it to his whole damn fam
Understand
If he frontin'
On any man down with the Clan
I be coming
For the headpiece, you can't cope
For my brother
I bring it to the Pope, word to mother
Serial, killer
Style
From Big Isle
So Stat
My peoples, are you with me, where you at?
Shit's gettin' deep in here
I mean like thick
Niggas looking all in my face, like they want dick
It's about to hit the fan, hit the floor
That's all I can stands, and I can't stands no more
What is it?
Niggas think they bigger
Because they got they finger on the trigger of a bisquit
They don't know I'm wicked
When I start to kick it
Heat they raw sound, wash it down with a Mystic
Then I add a Snapple
Nigga want the juice
But he don't, want to hassle
Though we try to overthrow the castle
Better yet, the tent when I'm comin' to your town
Black man
The rental
God
The pistol
YAH!
If you don't want a burn from the glock
Then beware {*gunshot*}
I buck shots, we move up
The buck stops
Here
No more dough will be made
Unless it's being made by hoes

[Chorus]

Break 2: Method Man
Keep it movin', baby, we be movin', uh
And keep it movin', you know we keep it movin', uh
And keep it
Movin', baby, we be movin', uh
And keep it movin', you know we keep it move
RHARHHH

[The Prodigy]
"And keep it"
"And keep it"
"And keep it"
"And keep it movin', baby, we be movin', uh"
"You know we keep it"
"We keep it movin'" --&gt; Method Man</pre>
