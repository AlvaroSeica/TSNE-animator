[John Legend]
I can't write left handed
Would you please write a letter, ah to my mother?
Tell her to tell, tell her to tell, tell her to tell the family lawyer
I'm trying to get, a deferment, for my younger brother
Tell the Reverend Harris, to pray for me, mmm Lord yeah
Cause I ain't gonna live, ain't gonna live to get much older
Strange little man over here in Vietnam
I ain't, I ain't never seen
Bless his heart I ain't never done nothin to
He done shot me in my shoulder, yeah, in my shoulder

[John Legend]
Boot camp we had classes, yeah yeah yeah
You know we talked about fighting, fighting every day
And lookin through rosy, rosy colored glasses
I must, ad-mit, it seemed exciting, well anyway
Yeahhh yeahh somethin that they
Somethin that they overlooked to tell me
The bullets look better, I must say
Brother~!! Brother when they're not comin at you
But goin out, the other wayyyy
So please, pleeeeease, call up the Reverend
Tell him to ask the Lord to do some good things for me, yeah
And I ain't gonna live, I ain't gonna live, I ain't gonna live
I ain't gonna live to get much older, yeah yeah
Strange little man over here in Vietnam
I ain't, I ain't never seen
Bless his heart I ain't never done nothin to
He done shot me in my shoulder
Shot me in my shoulder

[John Legend]
Strange little man over here in Vietnam
I ain't, I ain't never seen
Bless his heart I ain't never done nothin to
He done shot me in my shoulder
Shot me in my shoulder
He shot me in my shoulder
