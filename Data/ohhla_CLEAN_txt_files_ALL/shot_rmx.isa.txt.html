[Isaiah Rashad]
I take a drag of the square - I feel anxious, spit dangerous
as the verbal appears, is reflecting my perspective
Beer, goggle, and fear; role model so hallow
Shadow adolescence and a gaggle of them bitches
Road to the riches still paved with the ditches
Get caught up in the hype, your career is for a night
I ain't these other niggas, cause these niggas is fake
They ain't poppin' shot, these niggas is Papa Doc
If I ain't shinin', beat me up in a rhyme spot
No cryin' 'til I'm in a pine box
I got the bitches hittin' Mikey like where Zay at?
Probably fuckin' on her friend, probably LA at (WHOO)
Probably plotting on a mil staying where Fay at (WHOO)
Bitch don't run your mouth, we don't play that
Mama taught me better; can't count on niggas
Can't count on weather - go figure, nigga!
They ain't worried about this cheddar
Them niggas just sky diving in my propellers, I don't feel them (nah)
Ain't trying to be no freshman, I'm chillin' (nah)
Cause they'll bring a knife to the fight, and not kill em (BAP)
Me and my niggas is hungry, we're willing (BAP)
to bring a little ho to the +Party+ and Meek Mill 'em
Yeah, I feel like talkin' my shit
Come in the house, acting friendly, you can suck my dick!
I'm prayin' for some good rappers and a fleetwood
Where I gotta bring my A game, you just D goods
We don't wanna hear that weak shit, nigga speak up
Rocking old flows corn rows and a beeper
You niggas hoes, you niggas hoes, and I ain't even trippin
Cause we'll be laughin' to the bank and ridin' by these niggas
Mikey bring that mink with your low body Bentley
Put the hood in the fuckin' trunk and bring the party with me

[Chorus: Isaiah Rashad - singing]
I came, I saw, I conquered - ay, I shot you down
Now, your brain dont have no conscious, ay - what you do now?
Now, I came, I saw, I conquered - ay, I shot you down
Now, I bang, I bang, I blocka, ay - what you do now?
Ol', bitch, ass, rappers - ay, I shot you down
Ol', sensi-tive, niggas - ay, I shot you down
Ol', bitch, ass, rappers - ay, I shot you down
Ol', hype-beast, pussies - ay, what you do now?
Now, I came, I saw, I conquered - ay, I shot you down
Now, your brain dont have no conscious, ay - what you do now
Now, I came, I saw, I conquered - ay, I shot you down
Now I bang, I bang, I blocka, ay - what you do, dont make a sound

[Jay Rock]
Check-check, 1, 2
It's Rock, yo, yeah, Isai'
Yeah, look..

Everything takes time
Is you sellin' or you buyin' nigga? +Get Rich or Die Tryin'+
+Yay Yay+ on the stove, I had the choppers in the Cutlass to come
Just a young nigga tryna get some hundreds
I had a little bucket, yeah I rode it like a benz
Yeah I spent my little ends on that Butlass
Tell me who you trust...
Look I got my faith in God cause these clown ass niggas all bustas
These niggas not Jesus, they ain't gonna die for you
And only time will tell what's gonna lie for you
It's funny right what a couple lies will do
But seein' is believin' what defines the truth
I keep shooters on the wing when I'm ridin' through
And if niggas out of bounds they gon probably shoot 
(BLAOW BLAOW~!) Cause killin' is the hobby
Eastside niggas yeah we known for catchin' bodies
I used to have a deuce five riding on the trolly
On my way to school like "dare nigga, try me!"
Look, cause where I'm from I'm a blood on the nile
Surrounded by blue water, sharks all around me
Pigs on my ass, hoes tryna drown me
Niggas know I'm up so these haters wanna down me
Niggas know I'm king but they don't wanna crown me
It's okay, I ain't about to whine about
Look, a real nigga for real nigga now check it (check it)
I'm still here I'm still counting my blessings (blessings)
With no chains on (chains on) with no rings on (rings on)
Watchin' these fake rappers, getting my aim on (aim on)
Pop a shot, kill em all (kill em all)
And watch em fall like confetti, fuck em all (fuck em all)
It's just me and my niggas takin' over the game
And since I conquered this craft, nothing will be the same

[ScHoolboy Q]
Not a dollar on me, this home invasion a payday (yeah, yeah)
Two time felon they jerkin' me on my pay rate (ooh-wee, ooh-wee, ooh-wee)
Slavin' all these hours but couldn't shake down my rent late (yeah)
Makin' eight an hour I'm leanin' towards my AK (ooh-wee, ooh-wee)
Moms thinks I'm vicious, don't want me around the kitchen (yeah)
My living room, bathroom, my bedroom was evicted (yeah)
Missing from your homeroom my good grades was crippin' (cuz)
Before I even learned division, niggas I learnt the mission (OOH)
See I'm from where fiends scratch that itch, won't hit the lotto (yeah)
See I'm from where fiends fix that fix and not a bottle (uh)
And that little nigga that missed that bottle gon catch a hallow (uh)
or maybe even throw him - pyro pyro (pyoo-pyoo, pyoo-pyoo, pyoo-pyoo)
See this set don't make too many niggas rich that I know (know)
Either gang bang, sell dope or bet on the fold (choose somethin' nigga)
See money on the ground, my eyes glued to the floor (yeah)
I double deuce by my toe, see Figg get it and go (Figg side)
I feel stuck in my ways, a nigga tryna get paid
I'm tired of answerin' questions why "Oxymoron" delayed
See I was thinking November, but January is sweet (yeah)
It set my +Setbacks+ free (yeah), my +Habits+ won in my sleep (yeah)
So January agree, get a taste of this gangsta 
See I'm just tryna eat with a freak of the week (oh)
I'm just tryin' to hit em and leave em, dawg; they yours for the keep (yeah)
They'll be kissin' them bars, my sperm on their teeth (OOH)
Last night was nothing, this morning I'm a hero (yeah, yeah)
No belief in me dawg they said I'm out to zero (yeah)
Cocaine, cocaine, rock-rock, kilo (uhh)
Fishscale, cut well, you won't find Nemo (no)
Pull up to the block and they call me real nigga (yeah)
See I can be a real nigga, but my daughter see me bigger (ooh)
See a body full of love and yours full of liquor
But you'll always be my nigga, said you'll always be my nigga (yeah)
