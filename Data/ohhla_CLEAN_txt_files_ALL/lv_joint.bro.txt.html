[Intro]
Here in 2002, we present the fabulous love joint remix
Here we have two MC's, both which are in physical form
And a producer in producarial essence and we are coming through first with Phonte
C'mon

[Phonte]
Yo, Yo
Eh yo I love waking up with a extreme purpose
After a night of playin' dream merchant
Right this way, this a matter of extreme mergance
I love rap cause it seems ernest
Love this joint cause we re worked it
Love cell phones with free service
So I can call a broad, at E's house
And you and see, downloaded all my freestyles
On desktop, hard drop, MP3 files
Screamin' at the top of her lungs, "she lovin' me now"

[Big Pooh]
Eh yo, donny say the best love balance
A song for you and yours, make your mic fist pump valid
Late nights is a habbit, drinkin parme, makin matic
Jakes leave, flicks gotta have it
I love Macho Man Randy Savage
Screamin' Elizabeth come take a ride on my slim jim (oooh yeah)
I love Barry Heter, but it tells

[Phonte]
Just like I love Pac and Above The Rim
Cause this ain't a fable like the brothers grim
Love my niggaz milk, grant, kurt, dub, and em
Reppin NC, we keep it bubblin'
Punishin'

[Big Pooh]
Hate the players
I love ill doers and nay sayers
Freak broads, i'll holla later

[Chorus: Phonte &amp; Big Pooh]
Eh yo we ain't tryin' to willies or thugs in it
We just wanna spread love in it
We spread love y'all, all acrossed the globe
We spread love all acrossed the globe, we spread love all acrossed the globe
And from the north to the south to the east to the west (yes, yes)
Steady keepin' it locked with no test
We spread love all acrossed the globe, we spread love all acrossed the globe

[Bridge: Phonte &amp; Big Pooh]
And now what we want to do is get down with you
whether your drug free or smoke a quarter pound or two
At the bar or rent another round or two
We know we like the way it sound to you (the way it sound to who)

[Big Pooh]
It's Big Pooh from the leather state
I love philly's and cheese stakes
I love records when the beat breaks
I love school when the heat breaks
Fire hydrens maken, street lakes
I love 22 it feels great
Mike Tyson and his outakes, steppin out with the fly date

[Phonte]
So fans get ready for the out brake
Cause we gon' do it with or without papes
Even if I rhyme until my mouth akes
For all the people that I bond wit
Playin' for big stakes, on same Angus Bond shit
Even if you want this, get right
That's why I love wack niggaz, thanks for maken my shit sound so tight

[Big Pooh]
Because we got to get down tonight

[Big Pooh &amp; Phonte]
With no beef, no clones, no biters or sound alikes

[Phonte]
It ain't no ice, grills, or frowns tonight

[Big Pooh]
I put my love in this, I swear never to put down the mic

[Phonte]
This one is for the ladies and gents
That's partyin and payin' the rent, with life just gets to intense

[Big Pooh]
Cause it ain't all about tryin' to ball

[Big Pooh &amp; Phonte]
Get yo' hands up now cause we got love for y'all

[Chorus: Phonte &amp; Big Pooh]

[Phonte]
And to my man 9th Wonder, you don't stop
And to my man Big Pooh, you don't stop
And to my man Casar, you don't stop
Justus League, got to leave the sure shock
And to my man Vibrant, you don't stop
And to that cat Nicolade, you don't stop
And to my cats round the way, you don't stop
Keep on, it gots to be the sure shock
And to my man Big Fingers, you don't stop
And to my man, uh yo, you don't stop
And to my uh my man, you don't stop
And to my other man, you don't stop</pre>
