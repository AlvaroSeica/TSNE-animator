[Erykah Badu]
My love, what did I do
to make you fall, so far from me?

And now, I can't recall 
the cause of the fall, selective memory

Then you, you built a wall
A 20 foot wall, so I couldn't see

But if I get off my knees
I might recall, I'm 20 feet tall

Whoa...eyyy...
I'm 20 feet tall, mmm..
Yea-ooh...yeaa...
I'm 20 feet tall...

Whoa...eyyy...
I'm 20 feet tall, yeah..
Yeah-yoooooou, ohh....
I'm 20 feet tall...yea...
Ow-ooh, heeey...
I'm 20 feet tall, yea..
Yeah-yeaaa, yeaaaaah...
I'm 20 feet tall...
