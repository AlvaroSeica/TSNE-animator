[Big K.R.I.T.]
Yeah, the epitome of greatness, face it, no one plays it close
Sweetness on the beat, that Walter Payton flow
On track to be the best, what you pacing fo'?
Call plays, step back, pump fake and throw
Who dat? Drew Breezing on the field?
The document is monumental, shit, reel to reel
No huddle game planning, my form outstanding
Most haters commentators, call them Pat Buchanans
Doors still slamming on the Cadillac
Swanging lane to lane, gripping grain like a battle axe
Camera man capture the future like it's here for me
while these cheerleaders cheer for me

[Chorus: Big K.R.I.T.]
We too hard to be crushed, too gone to be stuck
Too fly to be touched, too much to be us
So we, just let 'em do they thing
cause we something like the A-Team
And I ain't talking bout they team
I'm talking Super Bowl great team
Undefeated all season
Champion shit, no Wheaties
Greetings

[Smoke DZA]
Great as '72 Dolphins
2010 Saints, we doing what they ain't
Say it ain't so, double back, what you came fo'?
Tryna mingle? Matter of fact, where's your bankrolls?
Make them niggas pay like T.O.
Mike Irving with the lines, fuck niggas get on your grind
Niggas know I get it in, Vince Lombardi
Award recipient, nigga DZA
Track flipper, that nigga like L.T.
Run through competition, smell me?
Coming at you 3D, better eat your Wheaties
Brett Favre, I go hard, it's too easy

[Chorus]

[Curren$y]
Uh, yeah, John Taylor, just as nice as Jerry Rice
Still dump Gatorade on the coach and rock this ring
For the 'un' let's sing, you done your thing
I seen it all from the bleachers, schooling 'em
Giving lesson plans to the teachers, all from behind the scenes
Pulling strings, out for one thing
Al Davis' "Just Win, Babies"
Lost Ark Raiders, at the airport early, rocking the latest
from one of my two clothing lines, that's product placement
Ice cubes in my pocket
Two minute drive Elway style, I got this

[Chorus]</pre>
