[Hopsin]
So I'm a flop? Nah, that's where you guys are wrong
I shit on niggaz, that's why I rap with a diaper on
Don't be approachin me with none of your mess
Talkin 'bout where I belong
Just tell your friends all bout me and sit
And watch as they minds get blown
Niggaz on that basic shit, now I'ma go ape a bit
I know y'all prayed for this, so don't trip
Here's a handkerchief for your razored wrists
My flows got a few ways to switch
Niggaz act hard, I'ma change the script
Everybody beggin to be a buddy of mine
Cause they know I got skills y'all can't prevent
When I lace a hit you impressive, none
You can take it as a lessson, son
If you was smart, you'd drop the mic and
Try to stick up a bank with a weapon drawn
Pillow Man was slept upon
That's the reason the West was gone
But I set the bomb, when it blows up
You niggaz will now where the heck I'm from
I'm keepin it raw fo' sho', flow's so diabolical
You all should know that it took like 10 whole years
Just for my balls to grow
No overnight success, I'm strugglin just to write this mess
The road to rightousness was more than words and skill that I possess

[Chorus]
I was the nigga all you niggaz used to clown
Now when I come around, I got you motherfuckers like "Wow!"
Yeah, how you like me now?
I'm flossin all you nigga's like BLAOW!
How you like me now, motherfucker?
How you like me..
How you like me now, motherfucker?
How you like me..
Ay yo Let me see you clown, motherfuckers
Let me see..
How you like me now, motherfuckers
How you like me...

[SwizZz]
S-W-I-Z-Z and add another
My swagger makes your girl want to cut, like upper
I'm mad hot, dog, my 16s should come with mustard
If you think I have a big head, then you haven't see my brother!
Stacked bad niggaz swore I wouldn't make it rappin'
Promised it couldn't happen and hated with a passion
A mixtape later I silenced their laughing
Now the same ones would probably suck my dick if I asked 'em
Its obvious I have it locked like CAPS
Rockin to a bitch fight beat that slaps
I do it major, Poly Sci &amp; Bio
I don't have haters only fans in denial
Now gimme a minute to hop in my zone, I'm makin 'em pop like Mary
I'm rockin the party to act all retarded, I'm makin 'em pop like cherries
I know this nigga is wild, but I will knock him down
Just answer this question for me:
How you like me, how you like me now?

[Chorus]

[Hopsin]
Oh, so you wanna be cool? You wanna be pals?
You wanna be closest friends?
See a nigga so hot, that's why I'm poppin up
Like I'm toaster bread
I say shit that don't get said
That's why I can't roll with feds
Illuminati got they eye on me
And they gonna see to it that a nigga don't get fed
My purpose ain't hard to see
I pull up on rappers like "pardon me
Your bars are weak, you spend too much time
Tryina get your sparklin charm to bling"
I be kickin them multiple syllables
Rippin up shows and holdin my genitals
Get a dose of the wicked flow before your niggaz run up
Sayin "Homie, you should've known"
It's crazy how life can switch
I ain't gonna lie to you mine was shit
Not anymore, shit changed up
From woman selection to size of tits
I know bitches who can ride the dick
Niggaz who think that my eyes are sick
Showin them many agents who be loving
The melodies that I supply them with
I gotta a note for all y'all
In the rap game who got an album stackin dough
Y'all got big, chains'll start fallin off like Michael Jackson's nose
Who the illest? Y'all know
Hopsin, yeah, bravo
I'm 'bout to leave the buildin right now
A-be-be-be-be-ad-a-be that's all folks

[Chorus]</pre>
