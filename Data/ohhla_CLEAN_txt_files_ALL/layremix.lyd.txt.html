(It's Young Lloy-day!) I'ma tear that pussy up
And we ain't makin love girl, we fucking in this club
No disrespect to Usher, I ain't never been a buster
Kelz put me on to "12 Play" when I was just a (BAY-BAYYY)
Look - I need a good girl, real hood girl to handle all night
from behind I don't play no games with mine (uh-uh)
I'ma lay you down, all night I make you whine like
lay, lay, lay...

[Chorus]
Lay your head, on my pillow {*2X*}
Lay it down {*3X*}
Oh lay it down ("REMIX!")
Baby bite the pillow {*4X*}

[Lloyd]
I think you need a G-Mix, it's somethin like a remix
Instead it's for the G's in the street - and the bad bitches
What's a bad bitch? She a hood classic
Big thighs, red bones, chocolate fantastic
Her tongue do magic! Go Go Gadget
Hit before I bounce cause her head fantastic
This girl she got me shoutin like church in bed like
"Oh my God" (OHHH!) Usher, no fag shit
Bring my niggaz in for this remix
And leave that love shit out on this G-Mix
It's Big Kelz and, my nigga Jeezy
Miss Patti LaBelle she ripped the first one off so fuckin easy
Easy, oh the streets need me
Bring back the shit that make you run and make a baby
This that new "12 Play," R&amp;B G shit
It's Young Lloy-day, R. Kelly and Jeezy

Head on my pillow {*8X*}
Baby bite the pillow {*8X*}

[Young Jeezy]
Lay it down, lay it down, you hoe lay it down
Everytime I'm at your crib Young, it smell like a pound
Got the condo crackin, baby what's happenin?
Probably still have them squares if a nigga wasn't rappin
First I undress ya then I'm jumpin off the dresser
I see you like my money girl, I give you a lecture
That ass so fine make you watch it like a Sony
First you grab her by her hair then you ride it like a pony
Louis V house coat, yeah it match the houseboat
All white e'rythang, yeah you know the house dope
Calicos on deck, baby this is G shit
Bust it wide open, "Lay It Down," this the remix

[R. Kelly]
(I've got a question for the haters)
Will you always be little men
that can not see what once was can be again? Tiny little men
Ha ha the king lives, Polow
Chillin in this club thinkin how to get wit'cha
I paint it tonight, I could show you the picture
You and me takin shots, I'm gettin in yo' head
And we fuckin up a storm in my bed - that's the intro
Don't wanna come off sounding like just another verse
See I just wanna sing this bitch no rehearse
Sexual freestyle off the top of my head
I'll figure the rest out when I get you in my bed
Now let me switch it up so I can talk about these silly cats
Tried to take my shit but I'm like OJ bitch, give me that~!
Back to the lecture at hand
My sex is perfection so I'ma make these chicks understand
That I wanna teach you, I - wanna teach you
Shawty I - wanna teach you, and then I - wanna eat you; lay your

Head on my pillow {*4X*}
Baby bite the pillow {*4X*}

Way you lay your head on my pillow
I know girl this gon' get serious like Thriller
You gon' feel that monster get bigger
And I ain't got no rhyme for the next part
I ain't got no rhyme for the next part
But that's okay because this is the remix
Yo blame Polow cause he made me do this
He called me up and said he want me on this shit
Said Kelz on it, it'll be a bigger hit, a bigger hit
Polow you owe me one - yup, yup, yup!
Nigga you owe me one - yup, yup, yup!
That's right you owe me one - yup, yup, yup!
I'm just bullshittin with you dog send me a case of Ciroc or some shit
Lloyd what up jo? Holla at your boy</pre>
