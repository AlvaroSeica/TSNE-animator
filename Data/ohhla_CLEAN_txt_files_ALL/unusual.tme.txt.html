(Satyr)
Fantastic, Reality
Dirty Lab here to snatch up your salary

(Time)
Satyr
(Satyr)
Turning bad into better, Big Time
(Time)
Big smile, no matter the weather, Satyr
(Satyr)
Turning better to great, big Time
(Time)
Big heart to swallow the hate, Satyr
(Satyr)
Turning great into grand, big Time
(Time)
Big plans in the palm of his hand
(Time and Satyr)
Dirty Lab massive, we're fantastic, fantastic

(Time)
sometimes it takes betrayal to learn forgiveness
and most years I like halloween better then christmas
I like dirty dishes, dust bunnies and nasty attics
and all of the monsters from final fantasy tactics
I find beauty in blood, murder and horror movies
and I don't mind a girl with a cute face and no booty
sometimes it takes peace to get sick of pleasure
and sometimes it takes a disaster to bring us together
sometimes it takes a breakup to find fantastic
and if you look pass their makeup you'll see that their plastic
I like the smell of spray paint, gasoline and magic markers
and having the flu on a weekday watching bob barker
sometimes it takes a divorce to find your true love
but smile at the blood, mixing with dirt to make mud
learn from everything, don't let negativity spoil it
so listen to this as you throw up in the toilet

(Satyr)
it takes an empty glass to appreciate the half full
the cheddar tastes better when you eat it in the rat's hole
every shining star eventually becomes a black hole
it takes sacrifice to keep your stripes up on the flag pole
sometimes a black eyes the only that guaranteed
to open up your vision and assist in giving clarity
sometimes it takes sinking deep down in poverty
to remind you why happiness can't be bought in shopping sprees
most silver linings get lost around the storm cloud
it's hard to smell the rose when you're bleeding from the thorn's gouge
it takes black tuesdays for wednesday's sunshine
to dry up all the rain and turn the tears into punchlines
sometimes it takes a pile of smoke and ashes
to show you why living's like playing with matches
sometimes it takes closed eyes in a casket
to show you why this life is fantastic

Dirty Lab massive, we're fantastic, fantastic

(Time)
sometimes it takes a fist in the face
to lose your ego and find your place
sometimes its best to wrap the present
and escape to your memories of laser tag and ten speeds
baseball mitts and army ant enemies
skinned knees for serenity and candy bars for energy
I like girls sweatpants, glasses and acne
cuz there the ones less used in this mid west trash heap
they call me Time I find the sexy in the homely
creativity's my company even when I'm lonely
I'm turning subtraction into addition
I'm turning smiling into my only addiction
I'm turning minuses into plus signs
until god taps me on the shoulder and says the world's had enough of Time
but until then finding the beautiful in the unusual
turning pain into positive musicals

take it for a walk, crunk</pre>
