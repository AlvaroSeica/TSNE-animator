Thanks to my rhyme inventin', I've ascended to the heavens
Did I fail to mention, got more ice than march of penguins?
I'm rich; I make the poor people cry
and I bet it all black because it can't be denied
I'm in debt... but we'll worry about that later
Let me show you the crib, the pool, and the elevator
Ben Grim is my trainer, Ben Sherman is my tailor
diamond encrusted inhaler just in case I get the vapors
Like Mead, I'm makin' paper but I aint spiral bound
as in downward, ain't a coward when I'm schoolin' these clowns
Leave 'em foolish and droolin' like they come down with the downs
Swan divin' like I'm Scrooge into a pool full of pounds

Black plastic; yeah, know you gotta have it
Blaze in the back, my motorcade stops traffic
Black plastic, debts gettin' drastic
Don't care, don't dare me to blast, kid!
Black plastic, know you gotta have it
Blaze in the back, my motorcade stops traffic
Black plastic, debts gettin' drastic
Don't care, don't dare me to blast, kid!

You've seen the heliport, let's go check out my rides
This is a Lamborgini Porsche, it's a one of kind
It's like the batmobile with a McDonald's inside
Sit in the comfort of your garage, inhale a burger and fries
As for clothes, man, you knows I be pimpin' them coats
Dolce and Gabbana, Prada - yeah, I guess that's dope
but, yo, I bought the vatican, I cold own the pope
make him lock and pop with a pope remote
Ben and Jerry's in the kitchen and I mean the two guys
They're makin me a sundae called the mc Surprise
I feed it to my dogs 'cause I'm watchin' my size
then I tell them hippies bolt because I'm fuckin' tonight!
Yeah, I got a harem; welcome to the Virgin Zone
Snuck 'em out of Muslim Heaven like I'm Indiana Jones
Like the Himalayan Hulk, you may think I'm all alone
but I got a bag a bitches and they're beggin to bone!

Black plastic; yeah, know you gotta have it
Blaze in the back, my motorcade stops traffic
Black plastic, debts gettin' drastic
Don't care, don't dare me to blast, kid!
Black plastic, know you gotta have it
Blaze in the back, my motorcade stops traffic
Black plastic, debts gettin' drastic
Don't care, don't dare me to blast, kid!

Roller coaster in the back yard... SHO' NUFF!
Five drops and a cave part... SHO' NUFF!
People starvin' in my home town... SHO' NUFF!
Fuck 'em, I got gold now!
("Show-off!")

Black plastic; yeah, know you gotta have it
Blaze in the back, my motorcade stops traffic
Black plastic, debts gettin' drastic
Don't care, don't dare me to blast kid!
Black plastic, know you gotta have it
Blaze in the back, my motorcade stops traffic
Black plastic, debts gettin' drastic
Don't care, don't dare me to blast kid!</pre>
