Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Flame, light up on, got a flame, light up on
Got a flame, light up on, got it back, start a firestorm
Got a flame, light up on, got a flame, light up on
Got a flame, light up on, got it back, start a firestorm

I burn it down, burn it down, burn it down, burn it down
It's going round, going round, you see it going round
I got that flame light up on, got a flame light up on
Got a flame light up on, got it back, start a firestorm

Now you know I got that flame on
Backs burn it down inside this bitch like a volcano
Too high for TV, need to came and put a nigga on cable
Roll up, roll up till nigga's eyes red like cannon
You don't want no come back, fuck papers and contract
Got 'em high of concept with blunt longer than Cadillacs
Lighters up, lights off, one hit on us, might gone
Put you on the floor like pine saw
Don't need no scale nigga, I bought it
Let's start a firestorm, on your hair like high rain
And burn rubber on the motherfucker with a gas tank full of propane
Riding round with that heater added to like I feel no pain
Deaf off that loud if you ever heard my name
You know

Flame, light up on, got a flame, light up on
Got a flame, light up on, got it back, start a firestorm
Got a flame, light up on, got a flame, light up on
Got a flame, light up on, got it back, start a firestorm

I burn it down, burn it down, burn it down, burn it down
It's going round, going round, you see it going round
I got that flame light up on, got a flame light up on
Got a flame light up on, got it back, start a firestorm

I'm high as fuck, trying not to fall
Your girl drunk trying not to call
Better cuff your chick and a bottle low
I had it once, but I swear to God we tried it all
So game on, I ain't even gotta say more
But all my niggas got icon, at 18 we enroll
Standing on the couch got me feeling eight feet tall
Eyes on me, but I swear that I can't see y'all, keep on
Piro addict, smoking way more than ever
Spied up to the mansion, you can smell it in my fenster
Kush is my cologne and the champagne is my passion
Might roll one up, but I don't know if I can pass it

Flame, light up on, got a flame, light up on
Got a flame, light up on, got it back, start a firestorm
Got a flame, light up on, got a flame, light up on
Got a flame, light up on, got it back, start a firestorm

I burn it down, burn it down, burn it down, burn it down
It's going round, going round, you see it going round
I got that flame light up on, got a flame light up on
Got a flame light up on, got it back, start a firestorm</pre>
