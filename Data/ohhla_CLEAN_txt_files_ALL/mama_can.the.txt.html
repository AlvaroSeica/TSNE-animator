[Intro: Solomon Childs]
Yeah, uh-huh, okay
I'm tired, I'm out here strugglin', ma
These crooked ass police, these crooked ass bitches (Staten Island)
(New York City) I'mma hold it down, though, ma

[Solomon Childs]
Based on a best selling novel
With blood on the bottom of the Grey Goose bottle
You muthafuckas is finished (get 'em)
Even the feds tried poisoning my I.V. (yeah)
Solomon Childs, A.K.A. The Chemical Ali (come on)
Sat the L.Q. and the Redbull (you know)
Distribution, the rule, since '76 (uh-huh)
The streets support, red, nigga (uh-huh), get my bread nigga (uh-huh)
Criminal ambitious, prepare for the millennium missions and I was born alone
So I'mma die alone (get 'em), scholarships
From workin' with a soul crisis (yeah) all praises due
To Allah's my idol, eyo so Dominicano (get 'em)
On the streets, squeezin' them 16 shot Germans
Up north, had beef with them Germans, complex murders

[Chorus: sample {Solomon Childs}]
Mama can you hear me? (Mama) {mama I don't wanna cry}
Mama can you hear me? (Can you hear me?) {mama do you hear my cry?}
Mama can you, mama can you hear me? {yeah, uh-huh}
Mama can you hear me? {for sure}
Mama can you hear me? (Mama) {mama I don't wanna cry, it's a problem now nigga}
Mama can you hear me? (Can you hear me?)
{Mama do you hear my cry?, you talk too muthafuckin' much}
Mama can you, mama can you hear me? {whoever said would get his feelings forever}
Mama can you hear me?
{Brother, whatever it is, nigga, you gotta put in work, nigga, come on}

[Solomon Childs]
This year I'm dancin' with the devil (get 'em)
Rebel without a cause (uh-huh)
Somethin' authentic, enemy of the state
Who said the rich couldn't relate?
Wild like them Haitians on Vice City, and Little Havana
And it gets yourself killed for false propaganda
Hittin' hammers with the lulu kids (yeah)
Alone (uh-huh) like the last Arab
With AK's in the palace in Baghdad
Talkin' is for lovers, I want powers beyond powers
Twenty O-3, Excalibur, Fidel Castro replica (get 'em)
Hear the emotion, dog, this the projects
Summertime in color

[Chorus: sample {Solomon Childs}]
Mama can you hear me? (Mama)
{mama I don't wanna cry, we ain't playin' with you muthafucka}
Mama can you hear me? (Can you hear me?) {mama can you hear my cry? It's my time, man}
Mama can you, mama can you hear me? {like it or not, nigga}
Mama can you hear me? {out with the old, in with the new, come on}
Mama can you hear me? (Mama) {mama I don't wanna cry
Nigga, you know I don't sound like nobody else, nigga}
Mama can you hear me? (Can you hear me?)
{Mama can you hear my cry?, I'mma show you what I'm talkin' bout
Mama can you, mama can you hear me? {It's time we took it them}
Mama can you hear me? {Too money niggaz runnin' around talkin', get ya shit sampled}

[Solomon Childs]
Straight through it, ain't no exit wounds
You talkin' bout leavin' the scene red
You should of seen the movie I made in the tombs (get 'em)
We the last outlaws (yeah) Valentine, we livin', Nexus, we livin' (get 'em)
Drivin' to the top like Stallone in Driven (uh-huh)
Raised with extortion sting (yeah) with gunplay
Like Pacino in the original script for Chinese Coffee (yeah, uh-huh)
Like the Tribe of Malachi (get 'em)
What makes you think we mans, what makes you think it don't take much
To force these hands (get 'em)
You doin' battle with an animal, the ultimate struggle

[Chorus: sample {Solomon Childs}]
Mama can you hear me? (Mama) {mama I don't wanna cry}
Mama can you hear me? (Can you hear me?) {mama do you hear my cry?}
Mama can you, mama can you hear me? {Ray Don for president, nigga}
Mama can you hear me? {Do you hear the future, nigga?, takin' over}
Mama can you hear me? (Mama) {mama I don't wanna cry, I'm skin' if you hear the future}
Mama can you hear me? (Can you hear me?) {Mama do you hear my cry? Frank Nitty}
Mama can you, mama can you hear me? {Ya'll give it to me, if you really feel it}
