(Razah talking)
Rubiez, Renaissance, The Blacksmith
Established 1976, Heaven Razah

(Chorus) Razah
My revolutionaries dance wit a gun inside slums
Same jungles that the Panthers was from
Independent like 'Sanford and Son'
My heart beat the same drum my ancestors was from

Let me get into it like this

[Hell Razah]
You woke the best rapper 'Buried Alive'
You shoulda kept my name outta your mind
I ain't sign but by the time let's hit 'America Online'
I turn a chirp in time to tarnish your shine
You look airbrush, graphic design
I'm just a wisemen who happen to rhyme
It's just half of my time
You got a lot of cards, money and jewels
You know the rules
I got confident with nothing to lose
I'm old school from that 'Soul Train'
Cold train blues, spit that propane fuel
You an example of what cocaine do
Yeah I'm flammable, heard your two-bars that's pertaining to
Hell Razah sharpness that's sparking up your darkness
Battling my conscious, my rocket ship launches
I ain't off the meter neither
See I'm off the compass
When North, East, West, South feel me I accomplish
Smoke a rap star; roll 'em in the red carpet
And spark it then go reload the AK cartridge
Battle me, I be on some suicidal bomb shit
With C-4 nitrogen underneath the armpit
(Bazz: They ain't ready for you son)

(Interlude) Razah
Yeah, I turn words into a diamond when I start rhyming
The Blacksmith - The Blacksmith
I turn words into a diamond when I start rhyming
The Blacksmith
Razah Rubiez

[Hell Razah]
It's like Osama met Barack Obama and he sold out his honor
For a rocket launcher, I'm like the Loch Ness monster
I conquer; cop a tissue-like Hannibal
I'm wit you like Emmanuel
You wanna be a Renaissance Child? Get the manual
I'm coming for my royalties down to my mechanicals
Homey I was born a king since the Book of Samuel
Bring along your camera crew so they could see me damage you
Yeah, I spit a 16 Bar Mitzvah
That coulda fucked around and bombed Hitler
Moving the form of a shark's figure
Study my art like a dark picture
Notice the crosses of swastika
Now we raised around cop killers
Oh you a Blood? Here's a maxi-pad
Now go and flag down a taxi cab
You in the wrath of my aftermath
Like Dead President's burnt cash
It ain't confirmed till it's Ur ash...

That's the word from The Blacksmith

(Chorus) Razah
My revolutionaries dance wit a gun inside slums
Same jungles that the Panthers was from
Independent like 'Sanford and Son'
My heart beat the same drum my ancestors was from
Bang my anthem in the Black Phantom
Controversial so they work the bandom
They get ugly but the verse's handsome
They get ugly but the verse's handsome</pre>
