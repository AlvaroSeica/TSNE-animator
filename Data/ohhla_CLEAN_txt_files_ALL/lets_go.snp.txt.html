[Intro: Snoop]
Yeah, what's up baby girl?
I'm just lookin over this homework
I really need some help
You wanna study with me?
That'd be nice, yeah

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
Mm, I wanna go study
Baby, would you be my buddy?
And help me with my pro-ject
Cause you are, who I roll with
Honestly, I know it
Take me boo, you're the one I wanna go with
Five days out the week, ma stays out the street
It pays we discreet, your fragrance is sweet

[Snoop Dogg]
Honey do, money do, but this ain't 'bout no money
This is 'bout me and you makin ooh, take it from me
First day of school I'm lookin cool, I got my clothes pressed
I'm a senior, but I'm seemin like an old vet
Time will pass me by 
if I don't graduate this time so I expand my mind
Find ways, to elevate it, motivate it, calculate it
Reinstate it, look at you girl, you got me dedicated

[Chorus]

[Wiz Khalifa]
Uhh, put me on the game
Though I keep my head in these books I'm not a lame
Usually kind of square I'm tryin new shit for a change
Tellin bitches things like "If you wanna get with me you're gon' need a lot of brains"
Ohhh - and just cause I don't play who say I can't ball
My nigga Mac do, me and him is in the same hall
So don't get mad if I relax and get my bake on
Just promise that you'll try and catch me if my grades falllll

[Chorus]

[Snoop Dogg]
Debonaire, there you are, look at my repertoire
Spittin game, and known, for reppin hard
Change that perspective, that's my objective
Cool, and oh so collective, connected
Check this, I need you more than you could know
See you the seed in my weed, baby help me grow
Let it go, let me know, where the Mead at?
Student of the week, baby I will be that
You know I need it, c'mon

[Chorus]

[Wiz Khalifa - repeat 2X]
Call you on your phone and never come and see you
Darling I would never do that (do that)
I'm roamin through the halls and askin people who be with you
just to try and know where you at (you at)

[Chorus]</pre>
