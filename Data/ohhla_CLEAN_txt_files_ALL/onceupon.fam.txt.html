[Timbo King]
Once upon a crime, in the County of Kings
Take it back to the '80's, when they wore back strings
Adidas suits, was the shits, and shades was the glasses
Bitches with the fat asses, queens in masses
'85, crack year, dealers made c-notes
Hanging at the junction, all I smell is pure weed smoke
Doing wrong things at the right time, night time
D's come around try'nna solve last nights crime
Now, to make the story interesting
Adolescence bugging with guns, knives and vestes
Robberies, crime rate rises by the hour
A vic' got hit, no trace of gun powder
Illegal business, auto deaths, so many charges
Chop shop garages, peace to bullet dodgers
Diggin' pockets, you catch a brick for a bonus
The neighborhood is flooded with drugs, criminal loners
Around the way, peeps don't care about your feelings
Guess who they follow, they role models are dealers
The street surface, as it's purpose so use it
Shots get bust in the park just for amusement

[Interlude: Various news sample]
There is outrage tonight, over the shooting
Of one of New York City's finest
Outrage because the accused gunman..
Is a parole killer (from the upper westside
This afternoon, rescuers removing the body
Of a nine month old baby girl)
A few blocks away on the upper westside
Another tragedy, this one involving
A nine year old boy, caught in a crossfire
Of a drug dispute...

[Timbo King]
The youngest shorties, they drink forties like grown men
Back then, you got stuck by ya own friends
Statistics shows, daily scams are contagious
Old people screaming out, somebody save us
It got worser, even police, they wanna hurt ya
A mother's too high for her baby, can't even burp her
Burglar rising, inside job advising
Crooked to the core, just like the St. Ide's is
Dirty cops, be selling glocks on the D.L.
Dice games every night, winner takes female
Slapboxing, on the reg', you show knuckle skills
I don't see, nothing wrong with a little pumpin' krills
Budget cuts, City Hall don't really give a damn
Aunt Jemima's real, but what about my Uncle Sam?
He's living foul, empty vials in the playground
Kids don't watch cartoons, they got guns now
Read the paper, stressed out, I can't take it
The laws are too strict, that's why criminals break it
You got heart? Heads will fear you and dear you
Once upon a crime in a place that's near you

[Chorus 2X: Timbo King]
Crime pays, in many ways, different catagories
The street glory, now guess who got the phatter story
Now, to make the story interesting
Adolescense bugging with guns, knives and vestes</pre>
