Typed by: krazy_doggz@hotmail.com

if I was a serial killer, they would find all my victims
heads in funky-ass station toilets
and if I was a serial killer, I would be strage and deranged
and I would never change

if I was a serial killer, I'd be know as the smoker
cuz I would cut off and smoke all of they hair
and if I was a serial killer, I would sleep on broken glass
and thumb tacks and I would smoke mad crack

first thing I would do would be to kill a couple hotties
that always get 'em all stirred up, decapitated bodies

dumped on state police lawn just before dawn
to let them know my ritual had begun

I'd crack a 40 with the devil, tell him dig me a hole
cuz I'm commin when I die, until then I'm in control

this is if I was a serial killer, and though I ain't
if I was I'd do my walls up blood red with blood paint

this is if I was a serial killer, and though I ain't
if I was I'd never stop because I'd know that I can't

if I was a serial killer, I would drive a back van
and I would ride around the college campus
and if I was a serial killer, I would walk among us
and gain trust until I needed that rush

I park outside these bitches homes
then drive away then come back with my light off this time I'm here to stay

I'd wear human bones around my neck and have my ceremonies
then go back upstair and microwaves aome macaronis

you know what's up in my trunk so don't ask me to pop it
once I get out to my cabin then I'll finally unlock it

this is if I was a serial killer, and though I'm not
if was I'd snap a photo once they die on the spot

this is if I was serial killer, and though I'm not
I'd know that I can't so I would never stop

(repeat 3x)
and I don't know myself anymore
and I don't know who I am anymore

except that I am strange and deranged
and I will never change

I wanna hold up this hatchet
this psychopathic wicked shit will burn a hole in ya brain

I wanna run with this hatchet
we gonna always keep it wicked, shit gonna always be the same

fuck the world, take me under bitch we tryna rule the tunnels
the tempest raining lighting bolts and fire rain
ICP with mike e. clark again

I wanna run with this hatchet
wicked clown, blaze, twiztid, boondox and lotus
holding down the underground and you know this, and you know this

I wanna run with this hatchet
I wanna hold up this hatchet

[repeat 2X]
if I was a serial killer, I would bury all my spiecal projects
underneath the garden in my grandmother's backyard
and if I was a serial killer, I would be strange and deranged
and I would rock my hatchet chain</pre>
