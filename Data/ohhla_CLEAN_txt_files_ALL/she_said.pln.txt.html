She said "I love you boy, I love you so"
she said "I love you baby oh oh oh ohh ohh-oh-oh"

She said "I love you more than words can say"
She said "I love you bay-ay-ay-ayyy-by-ey-ey"

So I said, "What you sayin' girl?  It can't be right
How can you be in love with me?  We only just met tonight"
So she said "Boy, I loved you from the start
when I first heard love goes down, something started burning in my heart"
I said "Stop this crazy talk
And leave right now and close the door"

She said "But I love you boy, I love you so"
She said "I love you baby oh oh oh ohh ohh-oh-oh"
She said "I love you more than words can say"
She said "I love you bay-ay-ay-ay-by" (yes you did)

So now up in the courts
Pleading my case in a witness box
Telling the judge and jur-y
The same thing that I said to the cops
On the day that I got arrested
"I'm innocent" I protested
She just feels rejected
Had her heart broke by someone she's obsessed with
She likes sign on my music
She makes out a fan of my music
So I love them diamonds to lose it
'Cause she can't seperate the man from the music
And I'm saying all this from the stand
But my girl cries tears from the galleries
Got bigger than I ever could have planned
Like that song by The Zutons - "Valerie"
So the jury don't look like they're buying it
And she's making me nervous
And I'm just screw faced like I'm trying it
Their eyes fixed on me like I'm murderous
They wanna lock me up
And throw away the key
They wanna send me down
Even though I told them she...

She said "I love you boy, I love you so"
she said "I love you baby oh oh oh ohh ohh-oh-oh" (yes you did)

She said "I love you more than words can say"
She said "I love you bay-ay-ay-ayyyy-by"

I said "Then why the hell you gotta treat me this way?
You dont know what love is
You wouldnt do this if you did...
Oh no no no...
Oh...</pre>
