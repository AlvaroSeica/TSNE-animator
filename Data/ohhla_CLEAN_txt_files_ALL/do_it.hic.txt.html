[Hi-C]
Yeah... H-I'
It don't stop... y'all niggaz must have forgot
Y'all motherfuckers gon' mind me
Yeah... check it out, check it out

Now I won't call ya crab if you don't call me slob
Livin' in the West is a full-time job
Niggaz be trippin' off of petty shit
Nigga miss me with that bank and then check yo' grip
You gots to know when to ride, know when to hide
Know when to blast, and try not to die
Niggaz be whoopin' that yang and shit
Knowin' they be suckin' up a gang of dick
You need to stop runnin' your mouth, be quiet
You won't throw a rock in a riot
See we can make shit like this all day
And serve it to yo' ass like some Aliz√©
All I wanna do is be a high roller
Step in my way I'll eat yo' ass like ebola - virus
Hi' is the name - you knew it
Fuck what ya heard, I gotta do it like I'm used to it

[Chorus: DJ Quik on talkbox] - X 3
Do it - do it, do it, do it
(I gotta do it like I'm used to it)
Do it - do it, do it, do it
{"I'm a veteran, boy"}

[Hi-C]
Now I don't mean to flag, sag, brag or boast
But I'm the most - underrated nigga on this Coast
I'll fall on my knees, throw my hands up to God
Thinkin' to myself "Kumbaya my Lord"
If it don't work this time, I'll quit
I'm right back in the field, slangin' that shit
But life goes on and the earth rotate
Players still play and then haters still hate
Don't step in my path, I'll whip ass
And if a nigga talk shit - I'ma do ya bad
You gets the benefit of the doubt
But if you ain't legit I'ma knock yo' ass out
Back in your mouth with that gangsta shit
Half dance in the house, nah we don't quit
Rem and Cashe and Kenny Mack
Lil' V from St. Louis even got my back
Quik (?) and G-One
From the land of the trees and a gang of guns
So come on down, be the first to get wet
You don't have to give me shit, I'ma take my respect
Leave a bitter taste in your face like lemon
Stackin' more chips than that nigga Russell Simmons
Y'all don't wanna see me in a rowd' fight
Thank you for comin' out, God bless ya, good night
{*gunshot*}... y'all niggaz better watch me

[Chorus: DJ Quik on talkbox]
Do it - do it, do it, do it
{"I'm a veteran, boy"}
Do it - do it, do it, do it

[Hi-C]
Now let me dig deep in my memory bank
And come up with some shit to make a nightclub sink
Fool what you think, we was doin' this for free?
Scratch in the bank, videos on TV
Don't hate me 'cause you're mad at the earth
Let the pistols bust and lay yo' ass to the turf
Guys are male bitches, they never get this work
A six million dollar man is what a nigga worth
Ladies in the house if you're down to win, say
(Nigga, what's up on my end?)
All the ladies in the house if you're down to win, say
(Nigga, what's up on my end?)
All the players in the house thats makin' scratch, say
(Bitch, it ain't goin' down like that)
All my players in the house thats makin' scratch, say
(Bitch, it ain't goin' down like that)
God gave me the talent, so why not use it
Fuck what ya heard, I gotta do it like I'm used to it

[Chorus: DJ Quik on talkbox] - 5X
Do it - do it, do it, do it
(I gotta do it like I'm used to it)
Do it - do it, do it, do it
{"I'm a veteran, boy"}
