And when I think about you
Thats the first thing that come to my mind
Im like
Wooo-hoo
Shawty you can get it all, what
You can get it all, what
You can get it

[Verse 1]
I know you heard my reputation (reputation)
You dont think I would ever do right by you (by you)
You think that if you and I was in a relationship
I would never be true (be true)
You think that anything I say is straight gang (straight gang)
And to me your just another new name (new name)
But what im tryna tell you for every man
theres a woman that'll make him change (him change)
And I believe you the one that'll make me (make me)
But any time I try to show you you shake me (shake me)
I know I make it real hard for you to take me serious
But baby girl I am (I am)
And I aint stoppin right here, I'ma keep going
And im gonna make sure everyday that you keep knowing
Whether if I have to send you flowers
Or talk to you on the celle-phone for few hours
Im yellin like.

[Chorus]
Wooo-hooo
And when I think about you
That the first thing that come to my mind
Im like
Wooo-hooo
Baby you can get it all, what
You can get it all, what
You can get it
Wooo-hooo
And when I think about you
Thats the first thing that come to my mind
Im like
Wooo-hoo
Shawty you can get it all, what
You can get it all

[Verse 2]
(One, one, one, one)
One minute you act like you like me (like me)
And then the next you don't (don't)
You still sending me crazy emails
Like I know its just sex you want (you want)
I cant lie the sex is truly incredible (incredible)
And every part of your body is so edible (edible)
I get tears from just thinking bout it
But that aint the reason why im stuck and cant let you go (let you go)
We got a serious serious bond (bond)
And when we kick it we have nothin but fun (but fun)
I feel a whole lot of L-O-V-E between you and me
Even though we still young (young)
Just your company aint gota get none
Talk the same lingo, understand where im coming from (coming from)
And if anybody ask me a question about you
Ima tell em you the one
You got me like

[Chorus]
Wooo-hooo
And when I think about you
That the first thing that come to my mind
Im like
Wooo-hooo
Baby you can get it all, what
You can get it all, what
You can get it
Wooo-hooo
And when I think about you
Thats the first thing that come to my mind
Im like
Wooo-hoo
Shawty you can get it all, what
You can get it all, what, you can get it

[Bridge: Johnta]
As long as you know that
I can have any girl I want to
Baby that sexual infectual
But still I choose you to be
With me and we're gonna
So you better not break it up
You got me like

[Chorus]
Wooo-hooo
And when I think about you
That the first thing that come to my mind
Im like
Wooo-hooo
Baby you can get it all, what
You can get it all, what
You can get it
Wooo-hooo
And when I think about you
Thats the first thing that come to my mind
I'm like
Wooo-hoo
Shawty you can get it all, what
You can get it all, what, you can get it</pre>
