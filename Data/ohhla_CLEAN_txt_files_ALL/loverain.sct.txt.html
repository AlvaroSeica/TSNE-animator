[Mos Def]
There was this daddy long leg spider 
Who spun his lyrics between the trees
And she was the fly girl who didn't see the web
And this is the story

[Jill and Mos]
Love(love rain)rain(a rain down)down
(Said what you say i say love)love(love rain)rain
(A rain down)down(I said what you say I say love)love
(a love rain)rain(a rain down)down(I say what you say)
(Brand new and live from Jill Scott)
(Making the ghetto feel hot and say what you say)
(let'em know)

[Jill]
Met him on a Thursday sunny afternoon cumulus clouds
84 degrees he was brown
Said he wanted to talk about my mission
Listen to my past lives...Word!
Took me on long walks to places where butterflies rest
easy, talked about Moses and Mumia
Reparations, blue colors and memories of the shell
tops
Aww yeah yeah he was fresh
Like summer peaches sweet on my mind like block
parties
and penny candy oh oh

Chorus

[Jill]
The rain was falling slowly and sweetly
And stinging my eyes and I could not see that
He became my voodoo priest and I his faithful
concubine
Oh oh oh oh (Mos chanting in African dialect)
Wide open wide the mistake was made
(Don't front, you know I got you open)
Love slipped from my lips, dripped down my chin
And landed in his lap and us became brand new
And the sky was blue

Chorus

[Mos]
It was half past dusk, you were rocking black musk
When your chariot stop low I made the clock wind slow
Grabbed my hips, curled a kiss across my lips 
Like a whisper (damn)
Blue Train title track playing on the system
Listen "la da di da da"
It's John C you hum the melody in pitch and on key
You was my quiet storm water sign
Pushed me to the borderline
Love that rumbled all the time
Kept my senses on the grind, sweeter than some foreign
wine
The original raw
Branded sweet like a cinnamon straw
You was my hardest distraction
My bombest distraction, my deepest inspiration
My heat, my frustration
But you diff from before you wasn't rifting before
"I want that old thing back" baby gimme some more
When clouds huddle in the sky 
And tears well in your eye just...

[Jill and Mos]
(Hold on to the moment love)
yes, you broke me but I'm human
(Even now that it's over love)
(Remember how it was over love, how deep we was
overcome)Mending myself, love concealing
(Just remember the moment love, you ? then blow me up)
The pain(just hold on to the moment love)love rain
(Remember how we was over love?) love rain
(Remember how we was overcome?) love rain

Repeat Jill Scotts verse
[Mos]
Just hold on to the moment love
I'ma do what I got to do
At night I still get hot for you
With this ? that I got for you
Just remember the moment love
Remember how we was over love
Shouldn't that just be enough
Shouldn't that just be enough

[Jill]
Yes, you broke me down

[Mos]
You got to rock with that
You got to rock with that
Jill Scott non stop with that
Said you got to rock with that
Make your shoulders neck back rock with that
Said you got to rock with that
Get up and do the diddly bop with that
Said you got to rock with that
Let it get up in your shoulders and bop with that
Said you got to rock with that
Get up in your necks and bounce with that
Ha Ha Jill Scott and Mos Def Sssss.....</pre>
