[Hook-The Grouch]
This ain't for the weak-hearted, go on and suck up the pain
All things to gain, we're gonna reach farthest
It ain't for the weak-hearted, I'm 'bout to lock in my aim
No need to explain, we ride the beat hardest

[Verse 1-The Grouch]
Attention span low, I paint a Van Gogh, though
Grew into man slow, with help from Han Solo's
I'm the Skywalker, I talk the way I want to be
But sometimes how I am and that don't always agree
I been down hallways and streets, corridors with alley cats
Nueve York to Cali, that's a lot of land to frolic in
I done some groveling, some disappointing squandering
Took what they was offerin', fools thought it was all for them
Let's all pretend, until you can't scratch the itch
When everything they say is should have, most can't probably get
So you hope more, you smoke more, you go broke more
Tempted to do what they do, what would you weaken your scope for
Ain't speakin' a folklore, just lore's, folks
They put you in then rue you, then you ain't as pure, nope
The strangest part about it is, the stronger you are
The better that you're gonna feel, it shouldn't be hard, but it is

[Hook-The Grouch]
This ain't for the weak-hearted, go on and suck up the pain
All things to gain, we're gonna reach farthest
It ain't for the weak-hearted, I'm 'bout to lock in my aim
No need to explain, we ride the beat hardest

[Verse 2-Zion]
It's like a fable how I walk, and stand stable's a myth
Born off in the sauna lyres like a curse and a gift
They say I'm scales, the truth is I'm strong and I'm frail
Standin' in the line of fire, gettin' wet from the hail
My philosophic bed keep me semi-confident
While I'm residin' inside the United States, it be apocalypse
Gotta get better than this, inside I'm strugglin'
The wind, it speaks spiritual tones, stock prices tumblin'
Hungerin' for somethin' much mo' out of this life
And I'm sho', inside my heart, I'll probably find a trap do'
I know we holy, but I'm only human, homie, feelin' lonely
Sometimes, sit at home with my rhymes, hope they console me
Hold me close the way a chorus zone be
I hear it moanin', I'm roamin' the planet spittin' my poems to the dome
And on and on until the breaker take me up to the Lord
And I'm walkin' the path until I'm soarin'

[Hook-The Grouch]
This ain't for the weak-hearted, go on and suck up the pain
All things to gain, we're gonna reach farthest
It ain't for the weak-hearted, I'm 'bout to lock in my aim
No need to explain, we ride the beat hardest
This ain't for the weak-hearted, go on and suck up the pain
All things to gain, we're gonna reach farthest
It ain't for the weak-hearted, I'm 'bout to lock in my aim
No need to explain, we ride the beat hardest</pre>
