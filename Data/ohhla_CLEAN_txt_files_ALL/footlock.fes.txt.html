[Intro: Fes Taylor]
Yeah, yeah, yo

[Fes Taylor]
The Vince Carter's just came out, they hotter than acid
Some like Air Max's, some classics
Penny Hardyways and Bo Jackson's, the old Charles Barkley's
Phoenix Suns jersey to match it
Foot Locker got the hottest sneaks for your feet
Plus this bad chick work in the store, I'm trynna beat
Give me discounts, I buy four pair at a time
Before they come out, that's why I shop here all the time
Black Nike's with the air bubble, lime Air Jordan's
Olympic version with the number nine
Red and white Iverson's, '76's hat
Two-tone doo-rag, cap slanted to the back
Adidas with the fat laces, Saucony's and Asics
Atomics, check it, stick to the basics
A pair of uptown's, and diadora's, British Knights
David Roberson's flights was looking right
Suade Puma's, New Balance, Harachi's all colors
Ladies watch me, girls love us
See me in a pair of Dr. Jay's, son they ain't been out
Since back in the days, when I got fades
Kobe Bryants, nine and a half, let me try
Shaq's with the Reebok pump, that's what I'm buying
Slam dunk, free throw line, thought I was flying
Sideline chicks on the court, they all eyeing
Magic Johnson Converse, Patrick Ewing's
It's who got the flyest, not who got the newest
Scottie Pippen's, black and gray, Delta Force's
Kid, I gotta have 'em, no matter what the cost is
Larry Bird's, that's Paul Pierce's, Celtics headband
Fast Break, know the boy gon' jam
Deion Sanders with the strap cross trainers
The gold line defense can't contain us
I got Ken Griffey's on, grand slam out the park
Sprewell, And 1 in your face, after dark
You can catch me at the sneaker store, buying 'em all
Four bags in each hand, walking out the mall</pre>
