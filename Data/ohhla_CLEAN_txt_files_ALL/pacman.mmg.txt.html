[Intro: Rick Ross]
There he go thats John Doe
There he go thats John Doe (HUH)
There he go thats John Doe
And I'm still whippin' up a kilo (HUH)

[Chorus: Rick Ross]
There he go thats John Doe
All my power pellets turn you bitch niggas to ghosts 
Pacman over 100 sold (HUH)
Pacman just order a 100 mo' (HUH)
Pacman you can fry it in the pan (WHOO)
Pacman in no time you can be buyin land (WHOO)
Pacman do it for your mom and them
Pacman until I get a hundred M's

[Pill]
Ay, ay; it's P-I double L: Professional Shit Kicker (HUH)
Yams on the stove; I'm fuckin your favorite stripper (okay then)
Pies flyin out, them zips they grew wings (yup)
Phone going stupid made a rack in two rings (WHOO)
Straight drop hard got them J's, plate, lickin'
Ground basing jumping over cars, they, Blake, Griffin (WHOO)
Got my chickens in the gym, yup, they, weight, lifting
See one thousand stamped on the tape because they yay, shape, shiftin' (WHOO)
That's that terminator choppa make a nigga do a backflip 
I can show you how crack flip while I'm loading that Mac clip
Catch em loading that Mack truck, I'll unload til his back drip
All I know is I'm stacked up and when I'm back them packs in

[Chorus]

[Rick Ross]
One hundred M's, I'm on my Geechi shit (HUH)
Gucci Luciano bitch you know I'm Geechi Rich (WHOO)
Maserati, boy I got two of them (HUH)
Same color boy I just got two of them
10 Chains see I'm one ignorant nigga (HUH)
I'm a whip it just to spend it nigga
Blew a mill ticket, one night at King Of Diamonds (ROSAY)
Me and Puff Daddy, bitch I'm the king of diamonds (HUH)
Small change that's what we call that (BOSS)
A-Rod money smoking on a ball bat
I'm on the mound, I got a pound (WHOO)
My folks in Haiti say them yayo prices coming down {Maybach Music}

[Chorus]

[Pill]
This that +Namco+ yay, Pacman what we sellin'
Got these J's chasing rocks like they chasing power pellets (HUH)
Met this lady named Eselis, say she nag for some terrace
But she hungry for that yayo ask her granny what she yellin' (WHOO)
Got my shirt off in the kitchen +Hot in Herre+ like Nelly
And these niggas dancing in these mask don't want stage credit (WHOO)
Just the keys to your car all your cash and your debit card
We serving hard Whole squad equiped and ready 
OK then, and quit flexing like you sold a pack (HUH)
Before they find you slumped over in a Cul-de-sac
My whole wrist lumped up servin boulder sacks 
Pink City representa, thought I told you that

[Chorus]
