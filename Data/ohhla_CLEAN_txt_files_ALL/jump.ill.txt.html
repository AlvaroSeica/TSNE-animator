[Intro: Ill Knob]
Yeah, Ill Knob, yeah

[Chorus: Ill Knob]
I make em wanna jump
This is how I do my thizzle
It's the Knob baby, you can call me nizzle
Now everybody jump
Get it poppin like a pistol
While I blow you like a tissue for your mental

[Ill Knob]
When we step into the jam, my whole crew brain programed
Nigga, get that loot and lets scram
I ain't fuckin with these niggas, I ain't lonely
They ain't homies of the fam nigga
If you ain't know me, I ain't rollin with ya mans, nigga
We get it poppin from the time we hit the door
The shorties hit the floor and they beggin me for more
Ah yeah nigga, me and Storm is back together
They ain't know I push this pepper, so I'm giving it all I got
Shorty shake it like she in the party naked
In the mirror in your bedroom, steady getting ready for the Knob baby
Like the real Rock Steady, I be toastin em and roastin em
Eat em like spaghetti, wasup
Turn it up all the way to the club
Shorty bounce on stage, sippin on some bub
Niggas wanna roll, then you gotta pay the toll
Bitch heat you like a roll cuz I my bitches love to bust

[Interlude: ?? (Ill Knob)]
Where my peoples at? (Yeah)
Where my peoples at? (Yeah)

[Chorus X2]

[Ill Knob]
It's the man of the hour, too sweet to be sour
Pick up your panties, bitch take a shower
Or better yet, you're gonna have to leave in a hurry
And I can't help you scurry cuz I'm drunk and my vision blurry
And I've had enough of these mothafucking creampuffs
Call themselves rock stars, makin mean mugs (no)
Ain't nothin but a gang of fuckin sissies man
Watch em throw a hissy fit when they see what Knibby did
I'm on the job as soon as they keep me on the hustle baby
Niggas is fossils when they see me flex my muscles baby
I keep it movin like my name was Patrick Newman
Even though I never got a read, I still know what I'm doin
And I wish a nigga would try to approach me
I'm like a shoe son, prepare for where the roach be
Too big, too strong, too black
And niggaz can't fuck with me, ya'll too wack
Nigga, nigga, nigga

[Chorus X2]

[Interlude: ??]
Yeah, yeah, yo, everybody, everybody, come on
Come on, yeah, jump up and down, jump all around
We got Ill Knob in town, and right about now
We wanna get all the ladies on the dance floor
We want all the ladies to report to the dance floor
All the ladies report to the dance floor
Report to the dance floor, so we can get everybody at the same time
To say, 'Ooooooooow'

[Ill Knob]
Check my status, it's the rhyming apparatus
I'm the baddest and the biggest one, what the hell these niggas want
I put it on em like my name was marijuana
On a bad trip, tell me baby, do you feel the trauma
Shorty, make it hot, gettin greezy in the sun
She naughty, and she sayin 'I can do it when I wanna'
OK, come and give it to me, shorty is a gunna
Drippin wet from the sex, the exotic fuck-o-rama
Baby, got you jumpin from the sounds we be pumpin
Nasty, open like she smokin, niggas want it, can they get it? No
Shit is radical and very much dramatical
We have to meet rats similar to animals
And when we get em, niggas hold em, then we hit em
Snake bite, game over, can you feel the venom?
Fake knife, dim light everytime we send em
Shake right, take flight, my niggas is gremlins
What, what, what, niggas, I make em wanna

[Chorus X2]</pre>
