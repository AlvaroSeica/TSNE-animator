[Pre-Chorus: Pleasure]
Girl you make me say.. (OH)
Girl I make you say .. (OH)
You make me say.. (OHH)
Girl you make me say.. (OH)
Girl I make you say.. (OH)
You make me say. (OHH)

[Chorus: Pleasure]
Call me...if you need some loving for the night
Call me...you ain't gotta dial the number twice
Call me...babygirl I lick but don't bite
Call me...when it's time to turn off all the lights

[Verse 1: Slick'Em]
Call me
You can call me anytime, anyday
Cuz I like my women feisty baby
I'ma take ya on a fast ride of ya lifetime that's gonna drive ya crazy
You dealing wit duds
And tell you the truth they can't come close to me
I'ma a blue star babygirl and I'm built wit plenty of energy
But when it comes to sex, I'm a real women scholar
Just hit me on my sidekick and know yo boy gone holla
Got you reminiscing
His love ain't true
His love is fiction
I'm tired of sitting
Give me a call, I'll be there in a minute

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Spectacular]
Yeah
When ya home alone just hit my phone when ya lonely, girl
You so beautiful, I made you my tenderoni, girl
And I like my girl wit some meat and not just some lil' bony girl
And I do like bony girls but long as they not phony girls
Call me up when ya turn off ya lights
Might show ya a couple things that you'll like
And you ain't never got to dial my numba twice
Cuz I'll be there quicker then some minute made rice, so

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Baby Blue]
Yeah
Baby Blue
Whoa
You call me I'm headed up yo block tryna hit yo spot
Have that Victoria Secret on when you feel that knob
I see you peeping out yo window when you hear my ride
Open yo door and let me come inside (Come inside)
We can role play
I'll be a dirty cop
Headed up yo block, making it hot
Lock you up in some handcuffs
Throw away the key to the lock
I'm 24/7 like 7/11
Know we better stop we I hear you yelling
So call me, page me, I'm on the way depending on yo attitude, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
