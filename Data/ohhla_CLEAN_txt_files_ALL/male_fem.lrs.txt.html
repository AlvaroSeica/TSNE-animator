[Intro: MC Lars]
I hear a lot of you rappers denigrating women on your tracks
Why you doing that?
That's not progressive, come on, women are people not objects
Let me explain

[Verse 1: MC Lars]
Yo, I'm a male feminist; doesn't mean I'm soft
Gender equality really gets me off
I see you ladies; women in the workplace
Up in the voting booth on your 18th birthday
Y'all be flying spaceships, y'all be flying planes
Y'all be running corporations every single day
Men can learn a lot from your hustle and your progress
Y'all be up on Wall Street, y'all be up in Congress
Germaine was a feminist, Kurt Cobain too
And once upon a time we made Coon vote it's true
But Elizabeth Stanton helped make it happen
Props to Joan of Arc and Abigail Adams
First-wave, second-wave, third-wave, whatever
Each generation is only getting better
I'm a pro rights, pro choice, pro sex feminist
Don't forget polemicist, feel the message when it hits
[Hook: MC Lars]
Ya I like em, like em, like em, like em
Male feminist
Ya I love em, love em, love em, love em
Male feminist
I'm a pro rights, pro choice, pro sex feminist
Men can be feminists too, it's true
Respect

[Verse 2: Mazeman]
I'm a pro rights, pro choice, pro sex feminist
Men can be feminists too, it's true
Sitting with MC Lars, reciting Michelangelo Fame
It's books and poems
Janice Combs raised Puff Daddy all alone
Thank god for her soul
I thank God for my mom for keeping me warm when it was cold
Dorris Parker was a writer and a critic
For such magazines like Vogue
She also wrote fiction, you know
I got respect for women
And your respect shouldn't be different
Respect all women
Even Rosa Parks had to get time
Fighting for equal rights for all Americans
Hilary Clinton, yeah she's winning
Angelina Jolie, female president
She donated more money than the government
Thank you women for being my motivation
I'm faithful and nothing's going to change this
Pro rights, pro choice, pro sex feminist

[Hook]

[Interlude 1: MC Lars]
Shout outs to my mom, it was hard having a child
I was upside down inside of her uterus
They had to do a caesarian section
That's dedication!

[Verse 3: MC Lars]
My mom's smart, two graduate degrees
My older sister Sarah teaches children how to read
Aunt Rosie is an artist, Aunt Linda is a scientist
My girlfriend is a social worker working with psychiatrists
Grandma Anderson, R.I.P
You made me awesome costumes every single Halloween
Aunt Anna was Australian, her life was really hard
Her intellect was in effect like Simone de Beauvoir
Susan B. Anthony and Betty Friedan
Inspired female minds to free the bold man
Through race and gender politics of Gloria Steinem
It's through books by Bell Hooks full of glorious rhyming
Sarah Palin taking on way more than she can manage
Alaskan back with politics are really doing damage
Even though your famous, you ain't no Tori Amos
Setting women back pro life politics are aimless
Lord

[Interlude 2: MC Lars]
I'm not trying to judge anyone's religious backgrounds
But if you get pregnant
You should decide whether or not you keep the child, Howard!

[Hook]

[Outro: MC Lars]
To all the young ladies out there: You could be president
Listen!
Unless you're listening in England and your British
You could do something else butÂ…
Actually there is a lot of options for women and I endorse that</pre>
