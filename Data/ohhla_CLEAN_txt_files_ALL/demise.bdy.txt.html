[Verse One: Ice-T]
Electrocution, Gassed
Shot in the head, Car crashed
Overdosed, Strangulation
Burnt alive, Violent demise!!

[Chorus:]
[Ernie] You're going down hard
[Ice-T] Violent demise, Violent demise
[Ernie] You're going down hard
[Ice-T] Violent demise

[Verse Two: Ice-T]
Decapitated, Drowned
Assassinated, Gunned down
Stabbed in the neck, Suicide
Burying alive, Violent demise

[Chorus:]
[Ernie] You're going down hard
[Ice-T] Violent demise, Violent demise
[Ernie] You're going down hard
[Ice-T] Violent demise

[Verse Three: Ice-T]
Live your life
You probably won't live to see twenty five
Those trusted to protect you will get you
Watch your back you still die (Still die)
Every man must die
We walk around in this illusion called life
You gotta go for it now, there's no time
There's no time, Violent demise

[Verse Four: Ice-T]
Mutilated, Hit
Poisoned to death, Skull split
Disemboweled, Skinned
Spikes in your eyes, Violent demise

[Chorus:]
[Ernie] You're going down hard
[Ice-T] Violent demise, Violent demise
[Ernie] You're going down hard
[Ice-T] Violent demise
[Ernie] You're going down hard
[Ernie] You're going down hard
[Ernie] You're going down hard
(* Heart Beats*) (*Gun Shot*)
