[ VERSE 1: Sugar Kay ]
Well, it's the king, it's the bumrush with the swing
Check out the funky new dope style that I bring
I'm Sugar Kay, yeah, it sounds funky
Special equipped for this microphone junkie
Cocoa Chanelle rocks the beats up on the intro
Cuts upon the fader with the hands, with an elbow
She's my DJ, she keeps the beats movin
She's a female and she keeps on groovin
Whipped this on your head, I thought you was retarted
Nodded your head and didn't realize you started
This funky jam that you can't resist
The name of this one's called 'Nod Your Head to This'

Nod your head to this	(3x)

[ VERSE 2: Mike Master ]
Now I'm speakin like a deacon, cold servin like a pastor
Preachin like a reverend, I'm the microphone master
Bust the funky rhymes that keep you on the go
That make you nod your head steady in a bodily flow
I keep humpin, pumpin to get the party jumpin
Never perpetratin, cause I'm not about frontin
Just givin what you want is somethin funky like this
Just like a girl you wanna ride and catchin sexual bliss
And yes, I'm comin fully charged, equipped and packed
To make your head bob and weave and swing forth and back
It's like a Tyson bout and this is main event
And I'm electrifyin the minds of all the ladies and gents
Cold swingin things the way it's supposed to be
To make you nod your head, yo, simultaneously
To a groove that makes you move and keeps you in sync
Just like you're tappin your feet, yo, you do not think
About what you're doin, but you can't resist
The Kings of Swing is in the house, and hey yo, nod your head to this

Nod your head to this	(2x)

It sounds funky

[ VERSE 3: Sugar Kay ]
Catch the Swing fever, catch it while it's hot
The Kings is smokin and we rock non-stop
Your temperature's risin, your brain's gettin numb
This is only a dose, wait till the album comes
With more beats to hump, nod your head and get dumb
So if you wanna battle, come, come, come, come
Cause I'm poetically inclined to find a rhyme all the time
To fit a funky beat with keyboards behind
The SP-12, hittin the switcher keys
Noddin your head to dope beats like these
This is a spirit, you'll feel it, you'll hear it
The only difference is, yo, you can't get near it
And in the process suckers get pissed
Because they got caught - noddin they head to this

Nod your head to this	(2x)

It sounds funky
