[Chorus pt. 1: sung]
It's been too long, and I can't do this baby
Said you're comin home, but you've been gone too long
It's been too much, of the same thing baby
I can't take no more, you've been gone too long

[Chorus pt. 2: Jadakiss talks over pt. 1]
Uh-huh, nah
I'm comin, I'm sorry
I know, I know.. you right
Uh-uh!

[Jadakiss]
I started off askin you to pray for me
now I'm on the phone beggin you to wait for me
I've completed a lot of programs
So when I see the board now they should have a date for me
I hear it in your voice that you gettin tired
When I ask do you love me you gettin quiet (love me?)
One day at a time I'm just gettin by it
When the meter runs out time get expired

[Chorus pt. 1 + pt. 2]

[Jadakiss]
Oh~! Yo this jail shit is corny, really startin to bore me
And you gettin fed up, and on top of that you horny
I knew that it would happen, cause you couldn't assure me
Dealt with a nigga that did time way before me
You ain't look happy to see me, when you saw me
You don't even write me back, you just ignore me
You don't even answer the jack, you just record me
Guess I been gone too long, you can't support me

[Chorus pt. 1 + pt. 2]

[Jadakiss]
In the penitentiary my name ring
When I come home it's the same thing
Guess you gotta take what the game brings
Niggaz change but a lot will remain wing
Thinkin about it while I sit here
Besides life ain't shit fair (nothin)
I ain't heard from her this year
Guess I'll try to make it better when I get there

[Chorus pt. 1 + pt. 2]

[sung]
See I've been holdin you down for a minute
And its been like forever since we did it
And the nights have been hell without you baby
And everyday I feel like I'm goin crazy
Cause you told me that this would be the last time
But you said the same thing last time
And I promised myself that I'm through cryin
So guess I'ma have to, kiss you goodbye

[Chorus pt. 1 + pt. 2]
