Chorus:
[Chiko]   I'm excited
          Everytime I see you walking by
          She's got it
          Body, face and attitude combined
[Ese Daz] I see you dancing in the spotlight
[Chiko]   She's got it
          I'm excited
[Ese Daz] You keep me lookin' cause you shine bright
[Chiko]   She's got it
          She's got it, baby

(Verse 1)
(Ese Daz &amp; Chiko Dateh in background)
[Ese Daz] Hold up
          She's coming this way
          Body, face and attitude for days
          Just enough to keep me on the chase
          She's got it all, I want it all, but when she moves her waist (She's got it)
          She's a match for me
          Sexy little lady, put your hands on me (She's got it)
          Let me take it to the rack
          You can kiss me and I'll kiss you back (She's got it)
          The way she puts her mack on
[Both]    Let me take you to the batter, let me put my mack on (She's got it)
[Ese Daz] Yeah
[Both]    Ain't nothing wrong
          Tell your girlfriends that it won't be long

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 2)
{Ese Daz &amp; Chiko Dateh in background}
[Ese Daz] So what's up, can it pop off (Pop off)
          We can jump in the ride, and take the top off (Top off)
          You so fly
          That's no lie, you know why
          G's lowride, and those eyes is like "Oh my" {She's got it}
          Cause I wanna get with ya
          Me and you, click
          Get the picture {She's got it}
          Bring it over here, baby (Baby)
          I wanna get you near, lady (Lady) {She's got it}
          Open up your mind tonight
          Don't be shy
[Both]    It'll be alright {She's got it}
[Ese Daz] A little bit of this
          A little bit of that
          Tequila with a twist
          A little like that

Repeat Chorus

Hook:
[Both]  A little bit of this
