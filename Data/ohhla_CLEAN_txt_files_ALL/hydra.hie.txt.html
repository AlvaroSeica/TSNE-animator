[Opio]
I'm a shady ass fool
I stick a machete in the back of
Your encaged, trying to disengage the blade just to save
Your life, caught a knife, backstabbed again
Jealous, want your cabbaging, yelling out
How I break out the mack ten, fully automatic then
start spraying up shop like the crooked cops
squeezing the trigger like Ice T
It's magical, how the shiesty ones gradually metamorphosise
Right before your eyes and then flash on 'em

[A-Plus]
I get cold sweat, every morning
Waking up from nightmares, about heaven being
This padded room, that god send, I'm never leaving
I wonder if I'm dead or breathing, I think he's punishing me
Cuz I think people look better bleeding
I praise, for Prozac and Codeine
To keep my mind floating, hoping I don't hurt somebody for nothing
I praise, I remember brighter days,before I was abducted by the grace
And now my mind's a maze, understand

[Del]
I be strong in the Berkeley streets
Searching for meat and trashcans with assorted leftovers
A face for closure, the home of mind roams is known
Amazes, thinking about the days  I rhymed( I could've made it )
I can't accept  panic swept, I'm an arsonist
Leaving the Oakland hills, smoke filled, I'm deadlier than arson it
Down at lake Merritt, setting ducks on fire, watch the fluttering flab
I'm on the run, fuck the priors

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Five hands is better than one
Instead of just won, when you see me you better run
They try to say that I'm crazy, but I'm normal
Y'all crazy

[Tajai]
They say I'm bonafied, infantile talented
Not commended enough to be committed, but in balance
I lost my parents as a kid
Nobody's really certain if their deaths were an accident
That gets me laughing, you're all just victims for the assassin
Using drugs is suppressive, but I can't surpass 'em
The killa  cats are catching, I wanna see the whole world in ashes
Only then will I be happy

[Casual]
They got my attitude switching, conditions my brain
Moving fast and I'm twitching of this  prescription drug, eviction
Trying to maintain the same
But everything 's against the grain
So it don't make sense to complain
I'm convinced that my brain is tensed from this strain of stress
Wanderin your town, with intense of pain, and yes
I like to do things until my mood swings
I'm like fuck that, y'all niggaz is strange!

[Chorus] - repeat to end</pre>
