[Lecrae]
Let's establish that he Israel king
So in Matthew 1 and 1 and on the 1:17
We see his lineage and trace way back into time
That legally he was fine in the Davidic line
And genealogically he' still King of the Jews
Cause the book of Luke exposes genetical clues
See a true King, though he didn't do it in the physical
He brought a new covenant to free I'm in the spiritual
And after some time, wise men from the East
came looking for the new born king in the streets
I know some of you dudes may cruise a forerunner
But Christ had the dude he used as a forerunner
And no promoter gunna cut it like the John the Baptist
You need publicity stunts so you datin an actress
A real King has somebody bringin the news
That his kingdoms ahead and they ain't fit to lace up his shoes
So tell me who's the one anointing all these so called kings?
They all self proclaimed and man, that's a dangerous thing</pre>
