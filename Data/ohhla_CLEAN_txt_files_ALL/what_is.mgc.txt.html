Song:   What Is Love
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

What is love
is it the feelin that I get
when your lips touch mine..... (You know love is whatever you make it girl)
(come on)
Is it the way I cant control myself
when we're in the middle of those passionate nights.... Babe!

(is like everytime im with you baby)

[Magic]
I think love is when I look into your eyes
the way it seems like your body was meant to be
every minute right here next to mine
my super sexy valentine

[Tiffany]
But you must of known....
that all the little things you do and say to me
you know I love them, but they got me wondering.

[Tiffany]
what is love, is it the feelin that I get when your lips touch mine....
Is it the way I cant control myself when we're in those passionate nights.... babe!

[Magic]
nobody ever gonna love your momma like I will
turn off the lights and bring your body closer
this night was made for you and I
slowly momma take my time

[Tiffany]
Baby boy... can you show me the meaning of love..
cause I got to know..

what is love is it the feeling that I get when your lips touch mine..
is it the way I cant control myself
when we're in the middle of those passionate nights.... babe!

what is love is it the feelin that I get when your lips touch mine.....
is it the way I get when we're in the middle of those passionate nights... babe!</pre>
