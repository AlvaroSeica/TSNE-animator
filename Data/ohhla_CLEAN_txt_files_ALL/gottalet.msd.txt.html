Song:   Gotta Let it Go
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
My heart just wont stop burning
But I gotta let it go
Fighting these feelings but they keep returning
I just gotta let it go, and
Mind, body and soul is yearning
I gotta let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go now...

I aint timing a muthafucka
Boy you so damn sexy
But I know that we, can never be
The circumstances and consequence of us, pursuing and doing
This shit I been thinking about doing
Aint gonna lead us to nowhere but ruin
I feel, I got too much to lose in you
A friend that I could see my side to ride
This the whole way through, oooh
And I really wish, I was the type of girl that aint give a shit
Cause all I want to do is lose control
Touch your heart, and
Ease your soul

[Repeat Chorus]

How cupid gone just shoot me down
At a time like this
I fiend for just one kiss
Cause dreaming seems so hopeless
The circumstances and consequences of us fulfilling
These feels that I been feeling
Only gonna provide a sexual healing
But I feel, there's so much more in our minds
Its like a spiritual higher level
Feel I known you my whole lifetime
And I really wish, I was the type of girl that aint give a shit
Cause all I want to do, is loose control
And touch your heart, and
Ease your soul

[Repeat Chorus]

He takes my breathe away
And he knocks me off my feet
Got my heart skipping beats
But I gotta let it go now
He makes me oh so shy
Blushing every time that I caught his eye
I love the way he makes me smile
But I gotta let it go now

[Repeat Chorus]</pre>
