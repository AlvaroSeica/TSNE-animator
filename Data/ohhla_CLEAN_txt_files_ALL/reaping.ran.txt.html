[MC Lars]
Which witch is the witch that you think you know?
Bay looks back and heads'll roll
She's riding with Satan, and for Mature
Turn you to a frog if you holla at her
Cause your D just sucks, that's all I'm sayin
So she heads home where the guns are blazin
The angels all duck, they're straight outta luck
They're stayin {?} and she doesn't give a care

[Beefy]
Straight from the hair, long lost in the lake
Lights out with the hairplay, make no mistake
Cause she's hard in the night, body type is a ten
While your jaw's on the floor, watch her hit you again
Really lovin every little thing that she does
Got a torture attack, heels packin some guns
Combo, it's over, she's on with the quest
Never mess with Bayonetta cause she does it the best

[Chorus One: Tina Root]
She was gone for far too long
Sleeping Beauty, what went wrong?
You can run, you can hide
but she will find you

[Random]
No stress, no sweat, can't nobody do it better
Who else catch bodies in high heels and leather?
Weavin and summonin, bleedin and sufferin
Killer, she make it look easy, you're strugglin
Awoke from a deep sleep, murder on her mind
Hurt 'em with her mind like I hurt 'em with the rhymes
Aoww! Sharp blades sunk deep in your skin
Beauty on the outside but a beast is within

[Beefy]
Ms. Pac-Man, Zelda, Lara Croft
Compared to our girl they're much too soft
Princess Peach and Princess Daphne
J. Claire Redfield, please don't ask me
who's harder - yo I spit the facts
She's part Tina Fey and part Mona Sax
Mess with her and you'll be a goner
Hell's found a heroine and there is none stronger

[Chorus One]

[Chorus Two: Tina Root]
Always ready for a fight
Killing spree, she takes delight
She's come back, out to play
A deadly thrill she strikes you down

[Tina Root]
Watch out now, killing spree
She can do most anything
But when she's down, to attack
All the angels watch your back
And now she's back, to attack
Murder ballet, watch your back

[Random]
Yo, this ain't your grandad's hack and slash
Unlock the future, we ain't reenactin the past
Cinematic, enemies let 'em have it
Swords and gunplay, no tricks or magic
Iron Maiden, sis ain't playin
Perkin, waitin in the shadows, pacin
Patience is virtuous, but she murderous
Leavin adversaries turned to dust, what?

[MC Lars]
Look to the sky, not a plane or a bird
Just an all out attack from a powerful girl
Wrong side double crossed ones regret the mistake
If you stay in this place next stop is your wake
Reassess, realize shoulda run, shoulda fled
One shot takes you down BANG BANG and you're dead
Don't play like a game, shoulda done what I told ya
Name Bayonetta, two words - GAME OVER~!</pre>
