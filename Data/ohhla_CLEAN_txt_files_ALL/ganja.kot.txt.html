Typed by: AZ Lyrics

This is the ganja night, now all my people exercise your ganja rights
These are the ganja daze, so everybody flex upon your ganja ways and recognize
This is the ganja night, where all my people exercise their ganja right
These are the ganja daze, now everybody flex upon your ganja ways and open eyes

They talk about irie, they talk about me, they talk about everything wrong in the world
I'm wondering why no one talkin of peace
Is there nobody that wants the same thing?
No more plain jane, no more feeling of negative energy up in the brain mang?
No more Government sniffing our main game
I'm leveling with you when I be writin these raps
We need to remind stoned and snipe prones they bridgin the gaps yea
2011 is when it'll all collapse when a lot of the neighsayers are taking their naps. ha ha ha

Imagine a world where you picked up a paper printed on hemp
and read about whats really going on around you
None of the stories that today are makin news make any sense
we're so consumed with fake reality that ain't true
Actin like a bunch of confused individuals
instead of focusing on whats real, it's like a funeral
The death of what we knew as normal has come
so it's time for us to break the mold and start on another one

This is the ganja night, now all my people exercise your ganja rights
These are the ganja daze, so everybody flex upon your ganja ways and recognize
This is the ganja night, where all my people exercise their ganja rights
These are the ganja daze, now everybody flex upon your ganja ways and open eyes

Used to stress about a lot of things comin up
Hustlin, slangin buds, anything to hit my nut
A savage beast runnin in the underworld
Firearms, dirty money, punk rock, and ripped curls
Started puttin fertilizer in to big tubs
Hookin up lighting systems growing pounds of killer buds
I never thought the gravy train would ever stop
Never thought I'd see the day when Kottonmouth Kings would pop
But the cops must have had a different plan
Kicked down my front door, ski masks, guns in hand
God damn now I'm facin 9 to 10 lookin back thinkin if I had to do it all again
I caught a break, released back to the streets, put my energy in to writin songs and makin beats
Thanks and praise, every day is a ganja day, ganja daze, thanks for the ganja daze

This is the ganja night, now all my people exercise your ganja rights
These are the ganja daze, so everybody flex upon your ganja ways and recognize
This is the ganja night, where all my people exercise their ganja rights
These are the ganja daze, now everybody flex upon your ganja ways and open eyes

Ganja ways, my ganja daze, ganja, ganja, forever in my mind it stays
Your not alone so many of us out here, lets come together we can surely make the cloud clear
So rectify a better vibe a longer lasting set of rules where even weed applies
You always know your in the right when you be puffin down
If you with the Kottonmouth Kings way above the ground

Hey D, taste this, smell this nug, this the biz, roll one up its big ol bag
Crack this bitch out the back, out the park, only spark apple pipes in the dark
How we do all the time, each and every day we smokin Kind
Each and everyday we roll it up (ganja) roll it up
Each and everyday we smoke it up (ganja) smoke it up
Nobody gets higher than I, I'm King Celaseye
Up in the clouds, over the seas, soaring the skies, I'm preaching the peace

This is the ganja night, now all my people exercise your ganja rights
These are the ganja daze, so everybody flex upon your ganja ways and recognize
This is the ganja night, where all my people exercise their ganja rights
These are the ganja daze, now everybody flex upon your ganja ways and open eyes

I wanna get high with you
Spend a little time in the afternoon
Just relax, slow the groove
I wanna get high with you
I wanna get high with you
Spend a little time in the afternoon
Just relax, slow the groove
I wanna get high with you oh ganja (ganja, ganja, ganja.......)</pre>
