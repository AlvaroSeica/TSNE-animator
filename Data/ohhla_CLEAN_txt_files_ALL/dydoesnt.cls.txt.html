This day doesn't die till [x9]
Forgive. Forget. That's a lesson that we haven't learned yet
We try. We cry. But a day doesn't die till the sun is set

Uh, yeah, night falls, days come and go
No retreat, stubborn, played the role
Held a grudge, seen it takes it's toll
I guess it proves I still got a way to go
Got to stop being so hard headed and hard nosed
And get rid of the excess cargo
You know, lighten up my carload
Cuz I keep veering off, back down to her road
Uh, I've been lied to and cheated on
I've been shit talked, beat down, treated wrong
And I won't forgive or forget
But I don't want to live with regret
And so I hope that I can let go, move on
Try to forgive anybody who did Luke wrong
Yeah, right I can hold hope, hoping it'll do
But I don't think I got the will to

[Chorus]
Forgive. Forget. That's a lesson that we haven't learned yet
We try. We cry. But a day doesn't die till the sun is set

He goes, balls to the walls till I drop
Love what I am, hate what I'm not
I no longer talk or text message
Any ex-girlfriends or these ex-best friends
Who left me with stress and this neck tension
And who never paid any dues but expect pension
So that's what our friendship is suspended
And if you thought I'd forget guess again
I don't have it in me. I don't have the discipline
Eye for an eye, the adrenaline is kicking in
Burn me once then it's shame on you
If I let it happen twice than it's shame on me
Okay, I get it, this is part of the vicious
Cycle we live in so I'm forgiving
Still getting heated with anyone who burns us
I won't hold a grudge but I'm still trying to learn to

[Chorus]

The day doesn't die [x5 with scratches]

Sometimes I think I'm a rebel
But I'm trying to be the bigger man and never sink to your level
I try to stay subtle in all my neighbors' drama
They're telling the police that I'm growing marijuana
Thanks. You lying punk bitch ass-wipe
Pricks comes and go every day that's life
And truth be told many other episodes occurred
But you ain't worth my time for a full verse
Shit, I forgive I never will

Forget. Forget. That's a lesson that we haven't learned yet
We try. We cry. But a day doesn't die till the sun is set

Forgive. Forget. That's a lesson that we haven't learned yet
We try. We cry. But a day doesn't die till the sun is set</pre>
