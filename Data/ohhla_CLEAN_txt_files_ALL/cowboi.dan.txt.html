Cowboi get back on your horse
Home boy get back on your horse
Rude boy get back on your horse
And find your way before your horse gets lost

This story's is dedicated to its main protagonist
And it illustrates how the human brain, it manages
To pull through, the toughest of terrains and challenges
Even when it seems we maybe can't sustain the damages

Helen lived in London
She was an office clerk
Her job required her to focus and to stay alert
She was walking home one dark evening late from work
The wind was strong and it caused that kind of rain that hurts
Now out of nowhere a figure did grab at Helen
His hand covered her mouth so she was gagged from yellin'
Into an alleyway she was then dragged, no tellin
What more in store for her this evening had this felon
Now pause the story there and put yourself in that road
Plucked from your life minutes from your warm abode
In that situation most people would freeze up and implode
But Hellen somehow managed to remain composed

Cowboi get back on your horse
Home boy get back on your horse
Rude boy get back on your horse
And find your way before your horse gets lost

She said "look it's clear that my fate here is sealed
You're twice my size so it's either give in or be killed
But this cold cold rain just adds to the trauma
Lets go to my house, its just round the corner"
He contemplated, he smiled a sick smile and then agreed
And to her doorway she did then lead
Her hands shaking, as she fumbles for her keys
But what would come next, he just didn't see
You see on the other side of her front door he saw
Her husband standing at 6'4"
Our villain turned and ran, as the husband gave chase
And soon enough that sick smile was removed from his face
See that is London, and that is Britain
We might get scratched and we might get bitten
But even when our heart and resolve is depleted
We won't lay down, no we won't be defeated
(Kid Carpet)

Cowboi get back on your horse
Home boy get back on your horse
Rude boy get back on your horse
And find your way before your horse gets lost
