Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
I'm high and my home girl tryn kick it
Like two ninjas getting new slippers on christmas
In a craddle of wrappin paper I was born gifted
A grounded person though a nigga all kind lifted
I'm on da road I done seen all kinda bitches
When I come home my girl actin all kinda suspicious
But won't leave me lone
All she want is a little attention
Is that so wrong
So I said I be back in a minute
But she know I won't
I'm partially caught up in the game
My name constantly being brought up
They throwin slangs
These hoes puttin me under the scope
Thats aim
I know I reverse that
She going in her purse church mane
I'm throwback I take it where it was at first mane
That live nigga rap
Wings on that B
I'm sittin in the back
I got yo bitch mine
Her head in my lap
I'm twistin up dat lime

[Chorus: x2]
My chain way heavy
My weed way smelly
Wood wheels in my chevy
Ain't shit that you can tell me
I'm countin up my fetti
I'm ignorin my celly
Them hoes all one me but I'm off dat already now...
Them hoes all one me but I'm off dat already now...

[Verse 2]
We can take it back to Air Max 95
If you wan start actin like you live
Jive asses was neva outside
I seen it first hand
Minimal dirt on my fingers was the game plan
Now its ten thousand dollar bank bands
Jet Life it pays man
Underground rap
Put a big house on top that land
They said I wouldn't do it now they understand
That I had already done it
Coulda been a super radio smash but I didn't want it
I rather play the cut stay 100
Papered up in a opera house
Sneakin bong hits until they put us out
(This...Bitch)

[Chorus: x4]</pre>
