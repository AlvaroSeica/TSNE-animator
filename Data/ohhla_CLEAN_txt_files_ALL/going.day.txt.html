	I'm going through a thang (Repeat 3x)

I'm having problems in my life, steady going through a thang
Fall to my knees beggin please that my life will change
My life has been good, but still it riles me, nothing is time is stored
Jacking this store for a gain of, something cause blacks are killing blacks
I gots to hustle while I, can
Don't depend on tomorrow cause I might be a dead man
I wake up in the morning, there's no food in my, fridge
My momma give her '86 is cussing out her kids
Age of 13 I started smoking on that endo
Kicked it with Jodi now I'm peeping out the window
A lot is on my mind and there's a lotta pressure pressing me
America and its system, I figure that they're testing me
I fall and catch myself, falling in my wisdom
Daddy's raping daughters and having sex with em
My mother's turning tricks and I'm ??? no more
My sister had a baby and she's eating off the floor
I'm going through a thang, my mind's about to crack
Somebody took my sack, I gots to take it back
My heart is in the ghetto cause the ghetto's steady pacing me
Last night I slit my wrists cause Jason was steady chasing me
No jobs in my city, I thankt that's a shame
Shorties in the house drinking 40's and we all going straight through a 
thang

	I'm goin, I'm goin, I'm goin through a thang (Repeat 8x)

I'm having problems, today was a bad day
My father's creamated, I smoked his ashes and threw em in an ashtray
My granny had a stroke and my sister's on dope
And now I read all the suicidal notes that my sister wrote
But I must move on, I must forget about the past
Cause see I'm deep in the ghetto and I'm surrounded by broken glass
It's time to see a murder, my glock is the object
I'm labeled as a killer, I cause more grief than the projects
With a revolver in my hand, they don't figure I live too long
They tell me to live right but my society's living wrong
I'm sitting in therapy, I got problems I won't admit
My teacher's a sex fiend and my reverend's a hypocrite
I'm catching myself from falling, my record deal was stalling
I'm ooting on them thangs while my mother's calling
Nothing worth living for but my family and the money
I pack a .44, so save the fur for the Easter Bunny
Cocaine and ??? I don't think I'm a ever change
All these problems on my chest, got me going through a thang

	I'm goin, I'm goin, I'm goin through a thang (Repeat 8x)</pre>
