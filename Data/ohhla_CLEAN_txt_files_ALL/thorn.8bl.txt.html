Temptation talking to me
I try my best not to listen
The world fuckin wit me
Tryin to stop my ambition
And niggas talkin bout me
I know they hopin and wishing
That ima give it up or quit
But I say fuck all these bitches
Niggas talk to much
Lemme tell you this
If you ain't seen where I been you can't tell me shit
Spirits walking with me
I close my eyes and follow
I live for today
I might not see tomorrow
I heard it all before
All the lies and excuses don't wanna see now more
Stupid shit I throw deuces
Dog im out the door
This so simple and plain
I keep it hardcore
You gon remember my name, the call me fatboy
Im such a pro at this thang
The whole key
Work hard get your doe at this thang
But people look at me
Judge, before they see the man
Cash stones im losin for they deal my hand
Could you roll one up
Toe beneath me
The devil got a player down on his knees
I don't know why niggas think they wanna be like me
You gotta see what I see  before you be like me
What you live for the truth but give nothing but pain
To anything evil for you soften your game
Words give life to the things that we think about
Life is hell
We go to heaven when we make it out
Yea, im like a thorn on a rosebush
Hard and prickely and discarded usually
Unseen, the world shittin on my hopes and dreams
Hope and dream that I can open up my throat and sing
Bring poetry and fly when I spread my wings
And let the world see the beauty in these ugly things
Scarred, like a scab, brittle and hard
Being green, and lame greens little reward
Slipping is a mistake and most they pay for it
Gruesomly hideouse, so you really can't ignore it
Yo, you see them pretty motherfuckas on the tv screen
Live and die for that fake shit on mtv
Turn the cameras off and watch our heroes transform
Runnin away from what real life did for em
Under the glitter and the bling of them expensive things
Thats where you find that truth and dogg that'll set you free
The real shit is the shit that I would want for me
Not them fools tryin to copy everything they see
This I will never be
From me you'll never see
Before I do it i'll say fuck this whole industry

Could ya roll one up
Smoke with me please
The devil got a player down on his knees
I don't know why niggas think they wanna be like me
You gotta see what I see before you be like me
Would you live for the truth but give nothing but pain
To anything evil puttin soft in your game
Words give life to the things that we think about
Life is hell we go to heaven when we make it out

Yea   fuck em, fuck em, fuck em  x8</pre>
