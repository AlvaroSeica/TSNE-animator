[Intro: Rick Ross]
Ricky Ross
Carol City Cartel
Cool &amp; Dre

[Chorus: Rick Ross] + (Dre)
Designer jeans and a hand full of dough (Yeah)
Bottle of that rosey, pass me some mo'
I got, mo' cars, mo' cars, mo' clothes, mo' clothes
Mo' money means more dough to blow (Bloooowwww)
Mo' bottles, there's more dough to blow (Bloooowwww)
Rick Ross got a lot of dough to blow

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Way up in them Tailie Hills, burnin' like the sunset
A nigga wit' a attitude, take it outta' context
Ridin' with the big thangs, lookin' like a bomb threat
Bin Laden beard, Afghan in a bomb vest
Ross, stranded on death row
Makavali's on the Maybach, kicks retro
She wanna gaze at the stars
Pull a panoramic view, Pull the haze out the jar
Rick Ross, I'm the best in the flesh
Gettin' blessed on a jet is a way to reflect
Hard work pays off, I'm a boss, you can tell
By the bottles in the pail, and the models that we share
I'm in a real estate, in a realer state of mind
We came for trigga' play, kill a nigga for a dime
I'm tryna' chill today, I got a million on my mind
Dice in my hand, one roll, I blow ya mind

[Chorus: Rick Ross] + (Dre)
Designer jeans and a hand full of dough (Yeah)
Bottle of that rosey, pass me some mo'
I got, mo' cars, mo' cars, mo' clothes, mo' clothes
Mo' money means more dough to blow (Bloooowwww)
Mo' bottles, there's more dough to blow (Bloooowwww)
Rick Ross got a lot of dough to blow

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Mo' trips, mo' whips, mo' money, I'm mo' rich
Mo' haters, mo' clips, mo' jewels, mo' shit
Half a hundred grand in some rubberbands
Gats all flashed in my other hand
On the other hand, I'm still pitching underhand
All soft balls off, bitch a stunna man
Mo' trucks, mo' bucks, mo' freaks, mo' butts
I see the vision, for club vision, the pre face
I get brain, I bust nuts, in each states
Soon as I see what I'm lookin' for
I sit up in that seat and cut em' off on them 24's
There it goes, baby girl come talk wit' tha' boss
I pop a rose bottles, you can kick ya shoes off

[Chorus: Rick Ross (Dre)]
Designer jeans and a hand full of dough (Yeah)
Bottle of that rosey, pass me some mo'
I got, mo' cars, mo' cars, mo' clothes, mo' clothes
Mo' money means more dough to blow (Bloooowwww)
Mo' bottles, there's more dough to blow (Bloooowwww)
Rick Ross got a lot of dough to blow

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Ever seen a fat boy in a big body
Know you wanna see about me, all you do is think bout it
Lease apartments to get kicked out it
Next day, buy a condo to get a kick out it
We don't take it for the view, this is what I do
When I'm on the beach, all my diamonds salt water blue
So let's party like the pack jam, Pacman
Fifty grand, stacked in my lap man
Get a lap dance, and if you get my dick hard
This ya last chance, to up up on that big car
Wit' tha Fat Man, certified Hood Star
But he a millionaire, look bitch you going far
This the movement, a few niggaz' you wanna move wit'
Gucci on my feet, see I'm only in the new shit
Ha, they say life's a bitch
But close ya eyes for a minute, and just bite this dick, it's Ross

[Chorus 2X: Rick Ross] + (Dre)
Designer jeans and a hand full of dough (Yeah)
Bottle of that rosey, pass me some mo'
I got, mo' cars, mo' cars, mo' clothes, mo' clothes
Mo' money means more dough to blow (Bloooowwww)
Mo' bottles, there's more dough to blow (Bloooowwww)
Rick Ross got a lot of dough to blow</pre>
