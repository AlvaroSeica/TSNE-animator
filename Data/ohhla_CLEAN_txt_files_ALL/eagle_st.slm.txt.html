What's up niggas and niggetes?
The Lil' One back in this biotch

First Verse:

Bouncin' up Eagle gettin' kinda mad
I ran at Errone cuz he had a powder bag
Took a bump from that powder
Got that drain from that white
I'm goin' to 49 to rock the mic tonight
I stepped up to a bitch when I got off the stage,
I had a gold-plated glock and a chrome 12 gauge
If the bitches hear my song, don't say I'm wrong
I'm down with Local 580, got a pocket full of stones
Hike nigga bounce, bounce, I can make em slip and slide
And my vigorous song, is biggedy bounce, slide, ride

Chorus:
Now bounce, biggedy bounce for me
Cuz I'm a gangsta ass nigga off Eagle Street
Now bounce, biggedy bounce for me
Cuz I'm a gangsta ass nigga with Ca$h Money
I say now bounce, biggedy bounce for me
Cuz I'm a gangsta ass nigga off Eagle Street
I say now bounce, biggedy bounce for me
Cuz I'm a gangsta ass nigga with Ca$h Money

Second Verse:

I woke up the next morning, to go outside
Saw my nigga Rob ridin' said "Let's take a ride"
Way in Gert-Town, to see my girl Lindee
Got a dime bag of weed and now it's time to act silly
Got back to the 10th I said "Nigga stop stuntin'"
I saw my homie Shawn he said "Nigga roast somethin'"
Now bouncin' up Eagle tryin' to get my mind right
As I'm comin' up the street I see my nigga Money Light
With a 40 in his hands, he was already buzzed,
Said he just smoked a blunt with my nigga Forty Dubb
Ray dropped me off in a green and white Regal
I can talk some more shit about Apple and Eagle

Chorus

Third Verse:

Now it was one Sunday night I was goin' to Rock Newton's
Saw my nigga Chuck, Lil T, my boy Lou
Eatin' at the bar, saw a bitch I used to sweat
I was spittin' buck game tryin' to get my dick wet
This was a stank hoe, from under those 'jects
She was all on my dick cold jockin' my set
Outside to rock the mic, saw my nigga Tec-9
Lil Ya, Yella boy, now I'm goin for mine
I'll bounce and bounce and bouncin' that bitch
All the gangster ass niggas you're welcome to trick
And the niggas in my hoods servin' rocks thats legal
Now bounce bitch bounce for Apple &amp; Eagle

Chorus</pre>
