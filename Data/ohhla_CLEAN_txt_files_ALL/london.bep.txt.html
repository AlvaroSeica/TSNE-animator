Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit
They aint ready for this
It's me, Fergie, Polow

When I come to the clubs step aside (Oh shit)
Pop the seeds, don't be hating me in the line (Oh shit)
VIP 'cause you know I gotta shine (Oh shit)
I'm Fergie Ferg, give me love you long time (Oh shit)

All my girls get down on the floor (Oh shit)
Back to back drop it down real low (Oh shit)
I'm such a lady but I'm dancing like a hoe (Oh shit)
'Cause you know what, I give a fuck so here we go (Oh shit)

1-     How come every time you come around
My London London Bridge wanna go down like
London London London, wanna go down like
London London London, be going down like
How come every time you come around
My London London Bridge wanna go down like
London London London, wanna go down like
London London London, be going down like

Drinks start pouring, and my speech start slowing, everybody start looking at you

The Grey Goose got the girl feeling loose
Now I'm wishing that I didn't wear these shoes
It's like errrytime I get up on the dude
Papparazzi put my business in the news
And I'm like get up out my face (Oh shit)
Boy I turn around and spray your ass with mace (Oh shit)
My lips make you wanna have a taste (Oh shit)
You got that ass, I got the bass

Repeat 1

When I come to the clubs step aside (Oh shit)
Pop the seeds, don't be hating me in the line (Oh shit)
VIP 'cause you know I gotta shine (Oh shit)
I'm Fergie Ferg, give me love you long time (Oh shit)

All my girls get down on the floor (Oh shit)
Back to back drop it down real low (Oh shit)
I'm such a lady but I'm dancing like a hoe (Oh shit)
'Cause you know what, I give a fuck so here we go (Oh shit)
