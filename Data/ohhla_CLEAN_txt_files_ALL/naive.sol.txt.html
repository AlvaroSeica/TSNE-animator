(Chorus)
I know, you think I'm young, and naïve
But you've got to trust in me
To be strong, and responsible
'Cause I think, I'm in love

I know, you think I'm young, and naïve
But you've got to trust in me
To be strong, and responsible
'Cause I think, I'm in love


(Solange)
Don't try to tell me this ain't real, I know I'm young
It's in the way he makes me feel, I know I'm young
I think my baby is the one, I know I'm young
It's in the way he holds it down, I know I'm young

(Beyonce)
I know you think that this is real, but you're too young
I know exactly how you feel, but you're too young
Too young to know if he's the one, but you're too young
Girl you've got time, so slow it down

(Chorus)

(Solange)
It's too complicated, to explain my relationship
My friends are hatin', cause they ain't feelin' what I'm feelin
Leave me alone, and just let me be
Find your own thing, and get off of me

(Beyonce)
It's not complicated, Girl I've been where you are before
I'm not under-rating
I'm just trying to protect your feelings
Solange listen to me, understand what I'm saying
You'll realize one day, how much I care

(Chorus)

(Da Brat)
Solange you might love the boy
Even sneak around the corner, kiss and hug the boy
But Beyonce' been there before
She don't want nobody to hurt you
'Cause Matthew would drill the boy
And I can't ignore that you young
We just don't want you to get sprung
On some young dumb-dumb with no crumbs
Get all up in your heart then run
Getting' your heart broke is no fun
Neither is somebody tellin' you that he not the one
You gotta learn for yourself though
And if you don't experience things, you'll never know
I don't want you wishin', you could've should've would've did it
But you didn't
Listen to other peoples advice
It's your life, make your own decisions
Honey really

(Solange)
It's too complicated, to explain my relationship
My friends are hatin', cause they feelin' what I'm feelin
Leave me alone, and just let me be
Find your own thing, and get off of me

(Beyonce)
It's not complicated, Girl I've been where you are before
I'm not under-rating
I'm just trying to protect your feelings
Solange listen to me, understand what I'm saying
You'll realize one day, how much I care
