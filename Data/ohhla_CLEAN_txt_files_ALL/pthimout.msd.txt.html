[Verse One]
Now I'mma tell it like this girlfriend he don't love you
Never have I seen him kiss or hug you
He don't make effort he don't respect you
Or accept you for you
Tells you what to wear and how behave
Comes in your home and treats you like his slave
Don't need him if he makes you sacrifice your freedom, get him out your life
Shouts and curses at you in public places
Sleep in your house on to part time basis
He ain't eve takin care of his child
He don't make you smile

[Pre-Chorus]
I understand you love him and your down
But that don't mean you gotta be his clown

[Chorus]
Girl you got to put him out
Changed them lox and all dat
G.U.G.2.P.H.O
And this time don't take him back
G.U.G.2.P.H.O
Take the time to love yourself
G.U.G.2.P.H.O

[Verse Two]
You can find real love with someone else
He don't even know how to be honest
All he know how to do is false promise
Any reel man agree he ain't a man
After the first time that he raised his hand
Treat your home like hotel and don't pay his way
Lost count of all the times that that dog has strayed
Sleep around, creep around, bring back disease what if next time it is H.I.V
4 baby mummas, 8 kids and no work
You can play strong but I know that it hurt
You make the choices you gotta stop this cos girlfriend the boy worthless

[Pre-Chorus]
I understand that you all were love birds from school
Now did you get from being his girl to just being his fool

[Repeat Chorus]

[Verse Three]
Your little girl needs a daddy I agree but the fool is far from that
Any boy can be a father, that ain't reason enough to keep on takin him back
He never reads with her or takes her out that shits called neglect you hear
Sure she confused and tired of always seeing mummas face bruised and drowned in tears
Look what you showin her by lettin him disrespect you
You just growin her to think that it's something that all men do
You owe it to yourself and your daughter cos she thinks it's all alright
When she get older follow the footsteps you showed her
How you gonna look her in the eye</pre>
