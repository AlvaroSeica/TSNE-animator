[Chorus]
Turtleneck and chain, turtleneck and chain
Turtleneck and chain, {SIPPIN ON A LIGHT BEER}
Turtleneck and chain, turtleneck and chain
Turtleneck and chain, {SIPPIN ON A LIGHT BEER}

[The Lonely Island]
My turtleneck fat and my chain so thin
and I'm sippin light beer and my crew right HERE
Chain razor-thin, light beer in my cup
And my sweater on turtle with the neck on PUFF
Huge turtleneck and my chain so skinny
Beer light all night, stand up, get DIZZY
Light cup, beer drink, thin so chain 
Neck turtle fat, man I won't say it a-GAIN

[Chorus 1/2]

[The Lonely Island]
Turtleneck? (CHECK~!) with another on deck
In case I spill somethin on it 
(Like some light beer?) Yes!
We be braggin 'bout whose chain is the thinnest
Turtle neck thicker than Delta Burke swimmin' in a Guinness 
(NOW BEAR WITNESS) But they can't see my chain
Metal so thin, it dissolve when it rain
Got more chains than the snow patrol
Everyone razor-thin like an insect stripper pole

[Chorus]

[The Lonely Island]
Chain so light when a breeze roll by 
Man, it float...man, it float... 
And my beer so light you could see right through it 
like a ghost... And I also wear turtlenecks!
Sweaters swallowin my chain like it's stuck in the couch
Lookin like Cookie Monster flossin his mouth
Find me coolin on the corner sippin light beer foam
You can tell by my turtleneck and chain that I bone!
Tur-tle-neck, light beer 
and a thin, ass, chain, and that's it~!
Tur-tle-neck, light beer 
and a thin, ass, chain, and that's it~!

[Snoop Dogg]
The rabbit kicked the bucket, Dogg said, "Fuck it"
Get my two-step on, with my turtleneck on
Thin-ass chain, light beer in my glass
Mackin at the bitches, the ones with the ass
Girl you know it's true, tell me what it do
Oh you like my style? Say you like my crew?
Say you wanna be under my chest, this turtleneck is like one of my best
Say you wanna be under my chest, this turtleneck is like one of my best
So I gets yo' dress, no stress 
Stayin fresh as my bandana, I'm a crook, so my look
On my game, gon' get get 'er
The fatter, the puffier, the pluffier, 
The bigger the turtleneck, the mo' gangsta it is

[Chorus]</pre>
