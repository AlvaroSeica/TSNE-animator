Song:   In the City
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

  "Me, I'm in the city, you know me, me, m-m-m-m-mmmmm"

[Chorus]
  "Me, I'm in the city"
I'm a monster baby, everything else is irrelevant
  "You know me, I'm in the city"
Ticka-ticka-ticka-trill press it up and I'm sellin it

[Verse One]
I'm an N.Y. city slicker, be lovin the city nigga
Far from a pretty nigga, always been a gritty nigga
Stay fresh to death, provide new steps
And teach niggaz how to live, you can't hide from death
See me I'm runnin these streets, bumpin these tracks
You need to hear this, you gon' give me somethin for that
Out of every 5, 2 gon' buy, but I don't mind
It's really nuttin to me cause I'm on my grind
See the next 5 get the next 10 now that's 20
But be proud of myself, this is that grind money
Shorty tell me what you find funny, and it's aight
Cause in about 6 months you'll be ready to die for me
See me with the next chick tears in your eyes for me
You my biggest fan and I don't want you to cry mami
A month prior to this you was ready to shine on me
I'm here now, when you adjustin your time for me?
Cause you know

[Chorus]

Now you know

[Chorus]

[Verse Two]
I started off, gettin my product off
In and out of stores this what you been hollerin for
I'm my own man, I'm showin you how to be yours
Niggaz wanna know, is Shube, hot as before
Like parallel lines a nigga, got 'em to cross
Laid my game down flat, out on the floor
Couldn't get a job so now I'm my own boss
Jack off the hook, I ain't takin no phone calls
Niggaz biggest question is Shube what's goin on
Cop the CD and listen to every song
It's worth every dollar and I wouldn't steer you wrong
See me on my grind and my peoples cheer me on
You are my peoples so you know the family's strong
Haters sittin back mad dawg darin me on
Lot of people say that boy nice, they can't be wrong
Don't hate, put your thinkin cap on, get your rap on

[Chorus]

Now you know
