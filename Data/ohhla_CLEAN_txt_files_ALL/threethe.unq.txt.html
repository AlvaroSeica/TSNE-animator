[ VERSE 1: Unique ]
This is me, U-n-i-q-u-e
By my side is B-u-g
And D-a-s-h-a-n
Lookin for new records to spin
And then he transforms and forms Voltron
And don't defy my will cause my word is bond
I'm dangerous, just like dynamite
So don't bite because this time you might
Choke, cough, throw up or suffocate
You have indigestion from the rhymes you ate
So think before you dare to speak and utter
You might find yourself belly up in the gutter
If you thinkin that we came to play
Unique, Dashan and Buggy B is three the hard way

(DJ Dashan)

[ VERSE 2: Unique ]
We're here to slice, dice, break, take and never fake
3, he, the other, then shake and bake
Fry, cook, boil, or in the oil
You're like a flower, my rhymes are the soil
That's one to grow on, so before you go on
Stage in a rage, yo, you better throw on
The proper head gear to continue this journey
Bring on your lawyer or an attorney
My rhymes'll rip, you flip, your beats'll trip ya
I'm like a Jew, my job is to ( ? ) ya
I'll have you cryin, my record you were buyin
There's no denyin or lyin I'm fryin, so stop tryin
To be like me, never try to cite me
Put on your mountain boots, go take a hike, see
What I was sayin, there's never no delayin or playin
So start prayin, no better yet I want you to stay in-
side, order, prepare for the slaughter
If you're over 40 introduce Unique to your daughter
And I'll sport her like a pair of new kicks
( ? ) show us her new tricks
Give her the Buggs, let him take over and say
(Yeah, our crew is three the hard way)

(DJ Dashan)

[ VERSE 3: MC Buggs ]
Now I guess it's my turn to rap and I'm about to burn
Come to the teacher so that you can learn
All the tricks of the trade, you graduate each grade
And if you try to play hookey ( ? ) you made a mistake
Cause Buggy B, yes, I'm a hip-hop fiend
I surrend you in a minute if you know what I mean
So behold the light of truth is what you seek
So pay close attention as I start to speak
With the voice that is clear so you hear
Every word that I say because the time is near
This is the hour to devour all the sucker MC's
I'm like a giant, you're a midget with the shoes to your knees
So freeze ( ? ) halt, stop in you tracks
Step back cause I proceed to put the records on wax
You melt like butter, or should I say margerine
You gonna faint when the saints come marchin in
I'm not a biter, the title is a writer
Give up hope cause the rope is bein pulled tighter
So heed the warning if you wanna see morning
You come stormin when we're performin
Now it's time to pass the microphone to Dashan
He puts the left ( ? ) but he's the right-hand man

(DJ Dashan)

[ VERSE 4: Dashan ]
Now I'm the DJ that loves to rap
You think you're smart, you get caught in my booby trap
I'm hard-hittin, my crew's tough like Bounty
We beat you down, have you leavin King's County
I bumrush ya, crush ya, then hush ya
You're just a pest and yes, it's time to bust ya
Your best bet is to come to an agreement
Also slam your face into the cement
I make the music, then edit the cut
It's copywritten, can't be bitten, boy, you must be nuts
Go on and try me, deny me, you still will not get by me
When I rush your stupid ass you will be askin, 'Why me'
It's like a creature feature when I teach ya
Defeat ya, seat ya, beat ya, eat ya
You're not with it so I might as well forget ya
Let the door knob hit you where the Good Lord split ya
Cause I'll subract, react and smack your back
Get off the crack, you're ridin on the wrong track
Cause I can shame and game and rip and tame 'em
If there's a problem you know that I blame 'em
Don't try to dis cause you know that' it's wack, black
I cut your dreads up as if I was snap back
So challenge me any time any day
And you will find out why they call us three the hard way

(DJ Dashan)
