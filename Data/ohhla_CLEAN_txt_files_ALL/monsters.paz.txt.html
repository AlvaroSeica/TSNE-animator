[Vinnie Paz]
I feel reinvigorated, don't fuck with the boss
I'd rather cut my own throat before sufferin loss
Anybody fuckin with me get hung on the cross
I have anger in me don't make me summon the source
I go to war with the Glock
I go to war with anybody motherfucker, I'm a sorcerer ock
I'm fuckin everything whether the bitch is gorgeous or not
I murder everything that's just some of my torturous plot
If you righteous and you under attack
Like the Anbar awakening them sons of Iraq
The fifty cal' is like a thunderous clap
If you think that you safe and nothin wrong that's a presumptuous act
(BRRAP~!) It ain't no tomorrow I don't got a dime saved
And if you did it's in the Wall Street crime wave
It ain't nothin worse than the world than a mind slave
Going to war with my people how I define brave

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
I'm a monster, ain't no one can fuck with the kid
I'm a monster, my jail brothers stuck with a bid
I'm a monster, everything I do is precise
I'm a monster, Pazienza ruin your life

[Vinnie Paz]
Yeah~! You know that Vinnie he been nice
Y'all don't belong inside of the ring like you Kimbo Slice
I ain't gonna take all of your skin, just a thin slice
They call me John 'The Beast' Mugabi when Vin fights
Vin Laden, Taliban, Hamas and Al'Qaeda
You a snitch cop lover you fuck with a traitor
I'm a motherfuckin brick you constructed of paper
I dumped the motherfuckin clip, now you dust and you vapour
I was there when all the planets was born
Before the Continental Drift and when Atlantis was formed
When Gandhi told the Indians to stand and be strong
And took the British out with intellect in spite of their brawn

[Chorus]

[Vinnie Paz]
Everything that Pazienza do is hard body
I don't care if you Blood, Ãieta, or God Body
I was devilish before the power of God got me
I just think I'll let the fuckin sword of Allah chop in
The Mossberg nine thirty-five is amazing
The Prada high tops the same colour as raisin
He a rat, not even his mother can save him
That's what you get for bein brothers with Satan
The thirty-eight practical, the Glock is for fair
And this for jail brothers somethin they can knock on the tier
Yeah, I'll stick a knife in your esophagus queer
I'm an animal, every rhyme will demolish you queers
You gas high, but you can get the D for a real price
This Sig Sauer one-nine-eleven is real nice
I'll stick through the wrist with a steel spike
And now maybe you'll overstand the pain of the real Christ

[Chorus]

[Outro]
I'M A MONSTER</pre>
