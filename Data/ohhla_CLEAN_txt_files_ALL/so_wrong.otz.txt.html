[Intro: Talib Kweli]
Come on, Talib Kweli y'all

[Verse One: Talib Kweli]
Cuttin niggas down like the amazon for posin like the cameras on
And push it with Joell Ortiz gettin my spanish on
Yo tego hombre we eatin money is Nathan's
I'm freakin these congregations deep in their conversation
With people facin Satan I bring 'em the word of God
My observation disturbin my words to murder your squad
I pull the trigger with my tongue 
Grab the bible, like break 'em young
Spit fire my brain is the bigger gun
I'm from Brooklyn where I'm from we callin niggas son
It's 'cause we shinin through the night break out the flashlights
You must be on a sure flight 'cause you packed light
Behave man I beat cavemen with stalag mics
Get up to fight you too tired for another round
They say I'm worshippin the devil 'cause I run this town
Now let me run it down and raise the steaks like a boarderhouse
With one fourth of the Slaughterhouse

[Verse Two: Joell Ortiz]
The most esquisite so gifted more like a wizard
I spit it a frigid blizzard of lyrics what I exhibit
To finish you little midgets a minute you'll all diminish
For mimickin my image I'm the sickest nigga forget it
You'll never be near as clever or better 
Every letter will sever your metal or medulla whatever
You fellas are feathers don't measure up well with a heavy medicine pedal
A incredible Pelle leather rockin hip hop federal
Better off servin 'em every word got a purpose murderous verses
Emergin beneath the surface like volcanos I burn
Every person on earth should be nervous become service and worship
The permanently perfect version of Merciless Copernicus
I was simple as stars an astronomer 
Found my bars a kilometer off to mars the odometer  
A phenomenon no common dynamotor able to monitor 
My temperature will pressure and crush your thermometor
OWWWW!!!!!

[Chorus: Brother Ali]
Been tellin me that I'm so wrong
Kickin through like a rollin stone
I built this buildin all on my own
I'm at home on this microphone, y'all don't hear me though
Been tellin me that I'm so wrong
Kickin through like a rollin stone
I built this buildin all on my own
I'm at home on this microphone

[Verse Three: Brother Ali]
UH! I finally figured the competition
On a mission to gimme a pot to piss in
I work hard play harder than hard decisions
Facin all like a head on car collision
Dig it, 'bout to forgive y'all what y'all been missin
Somethin crispy for ya listenin organism
Awww shit God forbid your my opposition
All that's sure 'gon get you a heart condition
Pimpin, the plot thickens 
The shot that you kick a make your balls like rock while your feet get lost
Get dropped on your seat, exhausted by the heat
Then tossed in the meat grinder grind to the beat
UH! Two thousand and ten I'm in house again
Straight six PM and ain't about to bend
Close your eyes and count to ten
Get that mic out your hand we don't know where your mouth has been
Street feeder, a street preacher
Key note keepin peace keeper, elite
UH! True believer few G's can keep up
Don't! Need your critique or your halftime speech neither
Emcee phoenix sweet Jesus retreat it
Wouldn't believe it, if indeed they don't see it
They take the chief cheeba chief it, try to sneak a peek
Into the recess is of my deep seeded genius

[Chorus: Brother Ali]
Been tellin me that I'm so wrong
Kickin through like a rollin stone
I built this buildin all on my own
I'm at home on this microphone, y'all don't hear me though
Been tellin me that I'm so wrong
Kickin through like a rollin stone
I built this buildin all on my own
I'm at home on this microphone

[Verse Four: Jean Grae]
Greasy slick talker, pick head picker
Shit sparker the lit bender the big sister
Face puncher when your bass jumpin off a cliff
The race mix face morphin pick pain off your chick
Lips spittin webs like Kris and Parker
Peter pardon, flip junk and just to boost the whips magnetism
The vast magnum hitter, grown woman
Don't start a black woman on some no he didn't
No prison goin no vixen roll playin sista
No gold digger, ho shit
I'm a boulder brass a ceremonious master
Second to only have to wait, NO BITCH!!!!
Oppose that the cold facts hard one simultaneously
With the bars will get you bar none proof
I'm amazin, group spontaneous to burst 
And I lay in a verse, upon namin me to birth
They just placed me in the booth and I said (JEAN!!!)
Yeah I was talkin I was walkin on the first day and you wasn't?
Second day sparkin in the cot with my cousin
Three, four parkin in the lot playin dozens
Five on the block y'all be huggin
Six doin shots of the licks trippin buzzin
Seventh I rested, I wasn't exhausted
I was takin a break so you can go and do your shit

[Chorus: Brother Ali]
Been tellin me that I'm so wrong
Kickin through like a rollin stone
I built this buildin all on my own
I'm at home on this microphone, y'all don't hear me though
Been tellin me that I'm so wrong
Kickin through like a rollin stone
I built this buildin all on my own
I'm at home on this microphone</pre>
