Typed by: Matt Jost

[ VERSE 1: Mac Dre ]
This California lifestyle that I live
Zeus amps, Zap' board, highs and mids
Woofers in the trunk straight slammin
Strikin through the neighborhood jammin
Where you can drop the top, or blow the brains
Hit the intersection and do some thangs
Passin up freaks with a gang of 'Yo!'s
Smooth thick legs, no panty hose
Silky perms and dookie braids
Brothers with curls, some with bangs
House parties rock way past 3
Players straight sip on Hennessy
High-speed chases, Chevy races
Havin sex in the strangest places
Nikey shoes, Levi jeans
Triple gold Daytons and straight laced Zeniths
Some on Vogues, some on Elites
Brothers like me rap to the beat
Dual exhaust, candy paint
Fat bank and a gang a dank
Never on time, always late
On the Bay Bridge or the Golden Gate
If you wanna live on the best coast
You better try to move to the West Coast
Where Life Is Too Short and The Game Is Thick
Home of The Mack and the Groupie Ol' Chick
Where brothers stay on the savage grind
Kick with a freak when they find the time
The C-a-l-i-f-o-r-
n-i-a rap superstar
Dose for dose, I love to spit it
And for the dank, I love to hit it
Hold it in, so it can choke me
And when I get dank, it will provoke me
To bust a rhyme, through the mic
A West Coast rap, the kind you like
I'm from the V-a-double l-e-j-o
Where makin dope raps is all I know
Wake up in the mornin, eat some grits
Hit the studio, make some hits
Now that you been told about
Watch you rap fans get sold about
One million copies, or even more
I'm pumpin dope rhymes to the record store
Yeah fool, you hear me spittin
Tellin you about that California livin

[ VERSE 2: Coolio Da' Unda' Dogg ]
Kickin it tough everyday, tryina make it through
Stackin a bank, pullin women and I take it you
Would wanna be down with this California lifestyle
Ruthless as a child, now I play the wild
In the streets of California you better be packin
And watch your back, due to the fact they jackin
The wind breeze blowin through the trees
And I'm still gettin tacked at a hundred degrees
Side so hard on the avenue
&gt;From L.A. to the Bay brothers stay comin through
In Benzes, Porsches, Fives and thangs
Drop coupes, lift Chev's and whipped up 'Stangs
Gold Daytons and Vogues, candy paint in the kit
Fifth wheel, gold grill, boy I'm talkin 'bout ( ? )
Some of the baddest females ever seen
Straight California snakes, I'll be your green
In the Golden State, livin way too real, fool
And if you're soft, you best be cool
To the double R all my time is given
Coolio and Mac Dre, California livin

[ VERSE 3: Mac Dre ]
California livin it up, girls be givin it up
Kickin back on the track with some heem in your cup
It's a twelve-month party
So when you see me on stage with Lott and Marty
Get out your seat and feel the beat
And peel a freak and don't stop till Cee's killed the beat
On the California coast we pop the most
And dose for dose we spit the dough
On the W-e-s-t C-o-a-s-t
It's young Mac Dre from the C-r-e-s-t
Down and dirty, doin things that only players can do
Straight California livin is what I'm sayin to you
Ridin, sidin, whippin, dippin
24/7 a brother ain't trippin
Mac Dre, the one you like to listen to
Nationwide and now I'm fins'to
Put a little slang in the rap game
And come up strong for The Mac, mane
