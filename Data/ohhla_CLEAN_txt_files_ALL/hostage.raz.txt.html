(Razah talking)
Razah!!
Six million ways to die choose one
You lie gotta take out your tongue
We in a slum with a slayed shotgun
You ready man? Let's do it

[Hell Razah]
It's a stick-up stick up
Hands in the atmosphere
I don't wanna see nobody brain's get splattered here
This is for them two-faces in ties with suitcases
While one side is smile the other half they racist
Run them acres and that gold you stole
We want that grill in the Vatican - the Geronimo bones
Matter of fact gimme your wallets and your goddamn phones
I wanna tie up your dad so they all blindfold
Tell Pablo if he wanna see his 9-years old
We want the money and the kilos and the ships he use
We gotta rebuild our hood and better our schools
If he moves homey, you know do what you do
Not as the Romans do because they killed the King of the Jews
Burn their offices and hold 'em hostage in the name of the Holy Prophets
See we was born inside projects, we hi-jack the plane cockpit
'Cause you was stealing for your back pockets, now there's no profit</pre>
