Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

LongShot, one-two one-two, my nigga Mad Crates
Aight, who workin nigga?
Who workin for they motherfuckin check then huh?
(One two) I got my motherfuckin... yo check it out

WHO WORK - we float and row hope without a boat
Go slow nope won't, let 'em poke it's not a joke
Gotta choke and pin push, skin Bush he been a crook
{?} took them wives, lives left without a look
And good times, starring me, hard to keep, pent inside
Then it ride and let, e'rybody know I'm sick of lies
And different guys jerkin me, certainly I'm hetero
And let it be known I kick a cold flow for federal
WHO WORK - go ill, flow spill too hard
You are, not what you claim to be cause true art
speak for itself and never ever compromise
Bet I spit it better than a rusty tooth incisor
WHO WORK - the song's hot when LongShot, don't stop
Give it raw 'til I'm on I'm kickin down the fuckin door
My tongue a double four, comin in pump and pour
I'm sick of livin poor, now gimme what I'm workin for
You herbs, keep hatin, I rise, you waitin
My life's proof to fakers we gon' have to take it
Hesitation never got a nigga nowhere
And if it did trust, I don't wanna go there
Not yet, who heard a hot set when Shot rocked
Why watch when I can get up on the stage and knock spots
The boulevard too, lonely for the God {?}
My ugly squad I told dem I rep you too hard to move large
Who workin for respect, who workin for the check
Who workin for the whole family get up out of debt
Who workin for the green, who workin for the scene
Harder than we are, workin for that major cream
Who workin nine to nine, ready to ride or fly
Tell me who workin for they worth with {?} and I
A couple niggaz but the rest just wait for they shine
I know a couple niggaz but the rest is waitin</pre>
