[Chorus]
Sit back get get dat dough
Put em in line like tic Tac Toe
Wolfpack hollaback b to da o
Red light green light g g go
Don't stop don't pause don't chill
Get hyped man high off pill
Where you from through them set's up
Uh huh yessir

[Mistah F.A.B.]
Who I'm is I'm Mistah F.A.B.
Open up my car let my system blast
The beat bang loud make the neighbors mad
You gotta be sad when you're with The Wolfpack
What you thought I don't care what you thinking
What you smoking put up in the air what you drinking
Do you got what it takes to win
What you ride a scraper or Benz
What size is them rims
Twenty-twos or tens
Keep em clean shine em up a little
I ride tha yellow bus and I sits in the middle
What you humming where your chin strap at
Cuz I ain't gone lie this slap
Do it big like Sherman klump
If you ain't no punk throw ya hood up

[Chorus]
Sit back get get dat dough
Put em in line like Tic Tac Toe
Wolfpack hollaback b to da o
Red light green light g g go
Don't stop don't pause don't chill
Get hyped man high off pill
Where you from through them set's up
Uh huh yessir

The Pack is back with Mistah F.A.B. kush kush
Bring hoes back red light yea I seen it
Going too dumb at the light yea you see it
B-town plus Town business believe it
Been to the party seen many hoes screaming
Feening for the rock like I got dope status
Burn the whole blunt no seeds no ass
Gigging she laughin ewww he's gigging
Been throwing up front shit been peeping
Riding yellow bus running from police
In the function with my coke white sneakers
See the gold grill that's noise for you sleepers
Seen a lot of suckers and they say they got heated
Then they get cold outside I don't believe em
Wolfpack back in the game for the taking
Shit I don't lie booty better be shaking

[Chorus]
Sit back get get dat dough
Put em in line like Tic Tac Toe
Wolfpack hollaback b to da o
Red light green light g g go
Don't stop don't pause don't chill
Get hyped man high off pill
Where you from through them set's up
Uh huh yessir

[Stunna]
What they say stunna go too dumb
Open my mouth n I'll let you see the sun (bling)
Stunt we do it for fun
Got a sip of the Remy so you know I'm on one
White tee blue jeans yea that's all a nigga wear
And the hoes think a nigga cooler then a polar bear
F.A.B. and The Pack finna bring the Bay back
And it's town shit nigga so we stay blowing sacks
We do the dummy retarded and ride the yellow bus
Ain't no other niggas out here fucking with us
And we stay with them toys cuz toys r us
I do it big like Pun so when you hear the beat go d d dumb
Mah niggas bang where you from
Shake your dreads and throw them hoods up
Feeling kind of tipsy finna get another cup
Looking for a light-skinned with a big butt

[Chorus]
Sit back get get dat dough
Put em in line like tic tac toe
Wolfpack hollaback b to da o
Red light green light g g go
Don't stop don't pause don't chill
Get hyped man high off pill
Where u 4rm through them set's up
Uh huh yessir</pre>
