Song:   Comb 4 My Dome
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I had a comb for my mother fucking dome mind
Then I'm sleeping, I'm a chill at night
Then my bitch you come up with some words that I dig
Santa Ana gonna be so nice
What daddy said to me then the answer to
When this shit about to be no good
People coming up, smoke a [?] of weed
And my brother smoke a bowl of bud

I had a comb for my mother fucking dome mind
Then I'm sleeping, I'm a chill at night
Then my bitch you come up with some words that I dig
Santa Ana gonna be so nice
What daddy said to me then the answer to
When this shit about to be no good
People coming up, smoke a [?] of weed
And my brother smoke a bowl of bud</pre>
