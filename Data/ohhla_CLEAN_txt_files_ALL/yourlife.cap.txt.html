[Cap.One]
Yo, now eva since I got a record deal
niggaz and bitches been in my crib
tryin to kick it wit a nigga jho
But I been peepin da game
And how to be scopin da reigns
Sittin on thangs
and whippin thru the city slow
Even a ??? hoes
Be tryin to get a piece of da don
Tellin me she can get me sprung (whassup shortie)
and be peepin my song
She wanna creep on da phone and
freak on da ???
Tellin me to hit it when her people ain't home
I got game for hoes and major dough
Cause got a chick got in a minute like what da fuck is you pagin fo'
Steady tellin me that you in love and shit
That you love da dick
If you wanna it then you came for more
If you break it, you replace it ho
I tell da bitch how it is shit, like Mothafucka Dig Dis (Dig Dis)
Imma Pimp nigga from da windy city Chi
No lie, straight rollin a 5
steady handlin my business
Now all you need is a thug

[Chorus]
You need a thug in your life
Who is makin and trippin he ain't holdin you tight (you need is a thug)
You need a thug in your life
Who take of business and get to lovin you right
Now all you need is a thug life
a thug in you life (All you need is a thugg)

who is makin and trippin he ain't huggin you right
who take of business and get to lovin you tight ( In yo life )

[Cap.One]
Yo, how come you wanna fuck wit a nigga

[Cap.One]
Everybody wanna live dat thug nigga life
Talk plenty shit while dey holdin da dice
Chain off da hook, da Roll fulla ice
Nigga bought two when they sold me da price
and dis hoes, I got'em by da dozen, love 'em
the way they be fiendin for me to bugg 'em, touch 'em
Me and my nigga be in da mall ready to ball
Lyin to dis broads sayin we cousins, buggin
Still, rappin like a nigga need a deal
Can't stop till I get my hands on a mill
Won't stop till dem niggaz know who da real
Bust shots dead at dem niggaz wit da steel
And its on, spit it for my niggaz back at home
My niggaz who is wild wit da chrome
SouthSide till dem niggaz call me da throne
So baby let me take you through the eyes of a don
now if you wanna bone

[Chorus]
You need a thug in your life
Who is makin and trippin he ain't holdin you tight (you need is a thug)
You need a thug in your life
Who take of business and get to lovin you right
Now all you need is a thug life
a thug in you life (All you need is a thugg)
you need a thug a life
who is makin and trippin he ain't holdin you right
who take of business and get to lovin you tight ( In yo life )

[Jazzy Pha]
