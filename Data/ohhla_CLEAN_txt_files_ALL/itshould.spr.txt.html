[Verse 1: Britney Spears (Autotuned)]
I've been thinking, just sitting thinking
On why I love you and all my reasons
And if I lost you, boy if I lost you
I'd lose myself and I wouldn't feel the way I feel now
You bring me's in, yes you bring me's in
You make me feel like a million, billion
I'll let you in but don't you break my heart
Don't you rip me apart, boy don't you rip me apart

[Chorus: will.i.am]
Baby, love, it should be eaaaa-aaaa-asy
It shouldn't be complicated
It should be eaaaa-aaaa-asy
I don't know how else to say it, say it, say it, say it

(I - don't - know -- how - to - say it)

[Verse 2: Britneyy Spears (Autotuned)]
I've got visions, boy I've got visions
of me and you, happily just living
I know they're out there, them beautiful men
But you my future, baby you my right now
If there was a scale from 1 to 10
Then my love for you is a million, billon
Boy, I'll love you 'til the day I'm dead
So please don't mess with my head, please don't mess with my head

[Chorus]

(I - don't - know -- how - to - say it)

[Bridge: Britney Spears]
La-de-di, la-de-da
It's the only way to love
La-de-di, la-de-da
It's the only way to love
(To love, to love, to love, to love {4X})

[will] I don't know how...

[Chorus]

[Outro: will.i.am]
La-de-di, la-de-da
It's the only way you love
La-de-di, la-de-da
(I - don't - know -- how - to - say it)</pre>
