[Intro: Cno Evil (Li-Mouse)]
Finally record this song now, if nobody fucking bother us *phone rings*
Ahh fuck, yo, pick up your phone! (Oh, who is it?)
It's your girl (oh my God, why the fuck she keep calling me, for?)
Pick your fucking phone up, man (aight, aight, hold up, hold up, hello?)
Yo, what she need? Ahh man (she wants a ride) Ahh fuck that, man, fuck that

[Cno Evil]
(Girl) I noticed you from afar
Pretty (girl) that drives a pretty lil car
With her (girl) friend in the passenger seat
Yo, this (girl), begins to massage my feet
But (girl), damn I know this is wrong
Cuz (girl), see I sing another song
Yo (girl), listen for a second
I got a (girl) already, and cheating's out the question
(Girl), there's other guys out there
No reason to mess up my life, like you really don't care
And (girls) is out to ruin each other
Using they 'lethal weapons' snatch up Danny Glovers
Girls, girls, girls, like the song went
Like to play games, but they lost then they wept
Then, girls, girls, girls, come in 5 cents
I like to keep my dime piece, no nickels, no thanks
Fuck these two faced, slim snakes, out to take yo cake
Fuck fate, fuck dates, fuck you, the fuck are they
To say, what I like and dislike
Koopa Troppa bitches, hop along the green pipes
You like secrets, you like to smoke green shit
You like to drink alcohol, you like to get weeded
Catch a dick slap to your jaw, little ma
You like to use slang that you learn from 106 &amp; Park
Fuck ya'll, for real, I'll say it again
Before you spit lyrics, try picking up a pen
My skills sharper than your pencils for your pop quiz
Don't let me get Elmer Fudd on you ducks and pop wigs
You females, must be from hell
Moonshine whores, noontime wars, ring those bells
I'm way too advance, for the simple beauty Belles
I'm a Beast, fuck pads, I write lyrics in Dells

[Interlude: Cno Evil (Li-Mouse)]
Yo where the fuck you been, man?
(Yo, man, I don't even wanna talk about it, right now)
Yo, I'm here recording verses without you and shit
Get on the microphone! (Yo, man, man, I tell you what happened)
(Yo, I had to go pick her up, man, it's bullshit)
I don't give a shit, man, yo fuck that, you should be rapping
(Yo, I know) Go head, fuck that, get on the microphone and tell me
what the fuck just happened
(Aight) Ok, man? (Aight, aight, aight) it's bullshit, man! (aight, aight)

[Li-Mouse]
Aiyo, fuck that, I had to pick her up and her friends
They flocked out the God damn building, in tens
Like 'Mouse, can I get a ride in your nice car?'
Fuck you, this like golf, you ain't up to par
'Stop acting, gay, Mouse' bitch! Who's acting gay?
I told the ho, I'll Catch U Next Tuesday
It's over $2.20 a gallon, I ain't wasting my gas
I rejected the next girl for having a flat ass
Yo, I got three seats and six of you
You, you and you, you know what to do
Step up the curb, you ain't get in this ride
Sit in the middle so my shit ain't leaning to one side
Fat ass ho, hit the gym and stop eating cookie dough
Cramping my flow, we here, bitch, you got to go
Next time you call me -- matter fact, just don't
You try to have me talk to you, and I won't

[Interlude: Cno Evil (Li-Mouse)]
Yo, the girl's a Catch U Next Tuesday time girl (yo, man)
Nah, man, it ain't like that (I know, I was just pissed, man)
Nah, you need to sit down, think about it, you know, you need to
To gather together your thoughts, and just think about it, man
(I need to play some video games, or something)
Yeah, relax, man, sit down, drink some Kool-Aid, watch some TV
Watch some Looney Tunes and bong bong (word)

[Li-Mouse]
Chill, man, this girl be calling me when times are tough
Knows how to make things smooth when shit is rough
Minnie Mouse voice, brown hair with the flat tummy
It can be raining outside but feels mad sunny
She coming over, and fresh I better be
Got to relax in scent like aroman therapy
Always by side, hanging by my arm
No matter where I end up, urban or farm
She got my back, at all times, that's 24/7
She gives me a call every day at 11
Ask the reverend, is marriage a question?
Don't jinx nothing, that's something you must not mention
A piece of heaven, I could love her to the end
Treat you like a queen, is what I intend
'Ordinary people' like we was John Legend
No wings, not in white, but you must be from heaven</pre>
