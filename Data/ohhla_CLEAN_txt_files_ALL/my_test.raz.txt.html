(Chorus) Darnell McClain

[Hell Razah]
Am I wrong that I'm hated on
Or is it breaking the horns off that reborn, Damien Thorn?
I've been sworn in to come to the Lord, I'm all in
Took an oath, say a prayer, then toast to La Pope Nor'
Translated it's the Black Pope
Made 'em parish ya folk bagging up bad coke
Gun poking out my Huey P raincoat
You don't wanna be the eulogy, name quote
You a joke, just a clone in the tombstone
With no shoes on, bury ya songs in that underground rule on
Its no beef, just rest in peace
It ain't sweet if we ever meet
I keep a trey pound seven in the heaven's reach
Soon as the devil leap
I send a leap year into a sleep
Then put careers way underneath, a six feet deep
I'm leaving nightmares on Bush Street
For wack rhymes over good beats
Weak hooks and you off sync
It's a loss after one blink
I'm built for more then just Cuban Linx
I got ya top boss losing brick
And might most cost more then buying drinks
But take ya shots out of iron tanks
I annihilate while I think
Then blow your brains into cyberspace
I'm Frank Lucas at the fireplace
With chinchillas that convince killers
Alfred Hitchcock's and spit spitters
Record labels Willie Lynching niggaz
Cuz ain't no Nicky Barnes snitch in us
You gon' need some better pitch hitters
I testify to the Most High

(Chorus) Darnell McClain

[Hell Razah]
My Lord I ain't perfect
But selling my soul, it ain't worth it
I bow down surrender myself to God's purpose
Therefore our physical body is your Church's
With three or more gather in truth the lie surface
The double-lead cut off wings off the flyest serpent
I ain't a rapper no more, I am a Wordsmith
Any feelings I hurt because my Lord's first
Will give laws in the verse so Heaven on Earth
Honor my father and mother for giving child birth
Blessed my wife and my seeds, I see how life works
We must forgive just to be forgiven
See I don't need no deceitful women
But the vision of a new beginning
When all the sinning coming to an ending
I'm in the booth repenting
For all the wickedness that I committed
I keep my tent frankincense scented
To make sure it ain't no Satan in it

(Chorus) Darnell McClain

(Outro) Razah
I testify my Lord
As I kneel down
Bow my head
In front to see the glory Lord
I know I'm a sinner Lord
And I try my best to walk in your life
But being righteous in this world is not easy Lord
It's not easy</pre>
