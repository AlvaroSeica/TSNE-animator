titan up your game, drive it up the lane
don't forget the name, aint a damn thang changed
do it for your team, do it for yourself
do it for your dream, do it for your health

titan up your game, drive it up the lane
don't forget the name, aint a damn thang changed
do it for your team, do it for yourself
dot it for your dream, do it for your health

at times I think too much, but not enough to miss the bus
every now and then I test my luck, I never lost my touch
paying dues aint the same, now a days the cost went up
so I sharpen up my output and I fuck the market up
carefully worded my outlook, commend the conqueror
born leader, show them your heart, guide them' through the dark
teach them how to tell the two apart
it's a start like the first two monkeys in noah's ark, just a thought
for the puzzle, play your part, make a mark, open up your eyes
analyze what you've been told, ___filter______ info
got to see it to believe it, pick a face I could read it
if your love is tainted you could keep it
crooked snakes smiling in my face, I play strategic
what's your reason
you need to walk it off johnny
you think too small, we need to empower the people
teach your children to be equal
cause they don't need to know what we've been through, it's just like that

titan up your game, drive it up the lane
don't forget the name, aint a damn thang changed
do it for your team, do it for yourself
do it for your dream, do it for your health

titan up your game, drive it up the lane
don't forget the name, aint a damn thang changed
do it for your team, do it for yourself
dot it for your dream, do it for your health

look in my eyes, try to psycho analyze me
I'm way beyond your understanding, nothing can surprise me
run my id, let your mind paint a picture
you can spend your whole lives trying to figure the enigma
I'm over the hill where they build crop circle fields
speak the outside language, behave untamed
unpredictable, there's principles, in this

he played the game like a vet, first dream, drop hoops like kareem
he shined in his rookie year, that's when he got his ring
that's when he started to drink, and stopped playing fair
point guard on the court, shooting in the air
he didn't care, either that or he wasn't aware
cause he loved basket ball but he never passed the ball
he would show up to practice with sun glasses on
game day, the same thang, the only one that aint slept
runnin' out of breath, cussin' out the ref

titan up your game, drive it up the lane
don't forget the name, aint a damn thang changed
do it for your team, do it for yourself
do it for your dream, do it for your health

titan up your game, drive it up the lane
don't forget the name, aint a damn thang changed
do it for your team, do it for yourself
dot it for your dream, do it for your health

reach a soul, teach the globe,
need to know, anything's possible
everything's optional
plant a seed, feed the root and watch it grow
beating on the walls of jericho
you should have seen it
lights, beams, screams from the crowd
the camera caught the moment the sky fell down
where are we now, what year is it and who kept count
general powel stepped down and bush crept out
I got his toe tag, a minor set back
he dropped his road map
six steps to hell on an early go back
kamikaze, return to iraq
fair exchange is
no robbery in this world wide monopoly
liberty, somebody forget to pass it out properly

titan up your game, drive it up the lane
don't forget the name, aint a damn thang changed
do it for your team, do it for yourself
DO IT FOR YOUR DREAM, DO IT FOR YOUR HEALTH (X4)</pre>
