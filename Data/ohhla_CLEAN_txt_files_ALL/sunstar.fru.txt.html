A 5th Element Production once again
Dedicated to the, Yo

[Frukwan]
Go head boo, See you do your thing
I aint mad at you cause you showin off your thing
Shimmy brown like her, Deep rooted from earth
Other sisters in condition be using up their position
React off sudden impulse, Bailin a check
I don't mean no disrespect, I will protect
Extravagant wine, Candle lights and refined
At night cruise the block, You're the one that I got
I give you props stand firm, And the others returned
In a field recognize, Together we build
More the better yo, We keepin it real
Soft and warm, Shine light from the livin
God, Yo how's that
You my backbone, My protection yo
I'll give you love, 120, and affection yo
And the others yours, Yep provided for the cause
Yo baby girl I'm yours, Hey, Check it

[Chorus 1: Frukwan]
I hear you call me
Yo, I hear you call me
So say my name baby
Yeaaahh
Say my name baby, (Sun Star)
I hear you call me
Say my name baby
Yeah

[Frukwan]
Hey princess of Arabia, A truth be live
Comin to ya with a vision that I felt inside
Aint diggin for gold, But here to let you know
Here's a let down, Teach your brother move slow
Don't need a woman to chase star struck brothers the punk
Legal divorce, Happens baby take em to court
Buildin hate, Shouldn't wanna escape or hesitate
Think twice with only one roll of the dice
If I was sick you was holdin the ground
Each and every conflict you was holdin me down
I'm feelin that, One in a mil boo, For real
So many to choose, You saved me I gotta give my life to you
Only the broad connect, Never loosin a threat
How would loosin even come close to forget
Adolescence only a root, But clear
Cause when your near, Them bad thoughts disappear boo, Yo

[Chorus 2: Frukwan]
I hear you call me
Check it out baby
I hear you call me
Say my name baby
Yeah, (Yeah)
I hear you call me
Say my name baby
(And I'm feelin it too)

[Frukwan]
Yo, If love was a crime, Penalty is death
But the love for my boo's all a brother got left
Baby gotta give me strong support, Last resort
Anything I'm fortunate I'm settin it off
Only come once, Take no shorts to save the game
There's only one brother shapin-moldin that frame
Brothers wanna disrespect, Penalty is death
That's enforced by the bond that we possess
If I aint able to by you fur, Diamond rings, Rolex
7 day cruise, Chillin at the house of sex
Rather then that, They bow me to fidelity
Rhythm and melodies, Massage the curve, Match my serve
In fact anytime we both go broke, And aint got
And end up in a cardboard box
I wouldn't care boo, Wouldn't give a fuck yo
Long as your there, Baby doll I'm here, Baby doll ahhh..

[Outro: Frukwan]
Yeah
I hear you call me
Yo, I hear you call me
Well say my name baby
Yeaahh, (What)
Would you rather have my baby
Or be my lady
Yeah
And I'm diggin at you, Let me hear you say it
I hear you call me
Say my name baby
Yeah, Uhh
Yeah, I'm feelin that
Say my name baby
I hear you callin
Uhh, Yeaahh, Give me that ass</pre>
