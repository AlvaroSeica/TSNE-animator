Yeah, Vast Aire, Shellshock
It's that gravy, know what I'm sayin
This goes out to my beloved family of Atoms (my word)
This goes out to the indelible MC's (you know they stay on you)
This goes out to Bay of Pigs (hell rock power kingdom)
Last but not least golden monkey clan (bananas and goals baby)
You know T1 aka Shellshock (c'mon)
And I'm Vast Aire, nuff said

Now let's build upon this issue
If the highway to heaven is narrow, then sin it's axis of speck tissue
And as one can see, I have no space
But I remain in the positive scale weights of the galaxy
What, you wanna fix fallacy?
You could run around the world twice chasing chasity
What in the hell possessed you, don't you know I'm cannibal
That means when rhymin I get down to the bone gristle
I start lickin my fingertips in the cipher
See naturally I'm higher than
That's right above any (any) homegrown
THC herbalized provider
But that's besides the point
Tell me who's gonna hold the weight, I can't wait any longer
I'm ready to hold plates with Jehova
Using Neptunes fork tellin' Zeus to move over
I'm here before dinner
Clearin' the periodic table of elements all
Then I'm supplyin' it with a tablecloth
Yo, you can catch me analog, mic hog
I can't feel rhythms without cholesterol
After all you must learn to examine the appetite within the nuclei
Within the presence of an omnivore's eye, that is I
And when sunlight shines on my throat
T call it the soloflex laryn-x lorax built from the trees
This is real life and I'm Vast Aire, I usually speak for
Skinny MC's tryin to start somethin
Bulemic MC's try to throw somethin up
I can fondle around the outskirts of diets
A donut at midnight ain't nothin, I'm a glutton
Now let's build upon this issue
If the highway to heaven is narrow then sin it's axis of speck tissue
And as one can see I have no space
But I remain in the positive scale weights of the galaxy
What, you wanna fix fallacy?
You could run around the world twice chasing chasity

And all that, knawmean, bullshit, know what I'm sayin'
This is T1, Vast Aire 
Bassline is like biscuits and gravy, knawmean
I'm Vast Aire, I'm not a hard MC, I'm not a hard MC
I'm Vast Aire, I'm not a hard MC, I'm difficult

I'll stand up brewin hot pots of piety hip hop
The gluttony inside of me won't stop
Yo, it won't stop, the gluttony, yo
If you can't have your cake and eat it, you never had it
Anyway, plus it ain't even your birthday
Now you're cramped up, my flow is that ability
You should've waited thirty minutes to press play
Or you're a fat MC, well if you don't say
You grab at the mic, all I see is a rib cage
See Vast is the vitamin MC you never believed in
So I vanished you to the malnutrition
MC's are too bloated
Thought they were fat, but they only retained water
You know them, the sluggish type they get led to the slaughter
Is you for gazing, the audience praise me
The black dyed, chubby thoughts and the chubby belly
You feelin me? Yeah
You feelin me? Yeah
Do you wanna hear a little more? Hell yeah
The beautiful balance of life
You don't want me to sit on the other end of the seesaw
Cause you're afraid you might see more, yo, you might see more</pre>
