[Trey Songz]
Baby, you're lookin so lovely
I'm thinkin bout you lovin me
Kissin me, touchin me
Lookin so lovely
I'm thinkin bout you lovin me
Kissin me, touchin me

I promised you
I'd take you out
Enjoy your night
out on the town
Light dinner and
some champagne
You deserve the best
of the finer thangs
Girl tonight you couldn't look
any better
Amazingly irresistable
I can see it in my mind
baby you and I
later on tonight
makin love

[Chorus]
DJ's playin the last song
We've been dancing all night long
Wanna hold you in my arms
Girl it's time that we get gone
Can't control it any longer
Cuz the feeling's just too strong
Baby you know
(it's such a beautiful thing
way that we be doin our thang
when we be doin it)
We should be makin love
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Love
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Trey Songz]
Most gorgeous lady in the room
I know you can feel
all eyes are on you
I think they all
are a little envious
of this chemistry
that we share between us
So, I don't wanna come off disrespectful
But I can't keep my hands off of you
Girl I'm all over your love
and if I can lay it down
then right here on the ground
I'd start makin love to you

[Chorus]
DJ's playin the last song
We've been dancing all night long
Wanna hold you in my arms
Girl it's time that we get gone
I can't control it any longer
Cuz the feeling's just too strong
Baby you know
(it's such a beautiful thing
way that we be doin our thang
when we be doin it)
We should be makin love

[Trey Songz]
Maybe in the car, babe
Or maybe we could stop some place
Cuz I don't wanna wait, hey
Until we get all the way home
No, no
You got me hard
grippin in the third lane
And girl it's only for the sake of your love
(Your love)
And all I see is us
makin love 'til the sun comes up

I can't wait {*3X*}
It's such a beautiful thang
way we be doin our thang
when we be doin it
Doin it, doin it

[Chorus]
DJ's playin the last song
We've been dancing all night long
Wanna hold you in my arms
Girl it's time that we get gone
Trey can't control it any longer
Cuz the feeling's way too strong
Baby you know
(it's such a beautiful thing
way that we be doin our thang
when we be doin it)
We should be makin love
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Love
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[repeat to fade]
I can't wait {*3X*}
It's such a beautiful thang
way we be doin our thang
when we be doin it
Doin it, doin it</pre>
