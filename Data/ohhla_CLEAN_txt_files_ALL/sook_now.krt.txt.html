[Chorus: Big K.R.I.T.]
Aww sookie, sookie now
Aww sookie, sookie now
Aww sookie, sookie now, sookie now
Aww sookie, sookie now, sookie now
Aww sookie, sookie now, sookie now
Aww sookie, sookie now, sookie now
Aww sookie, sookie now

[Big K.R.I.T.]
M-I-crooked now
I never left the crock pot, bitch I'm cooking now
Old school Ferris wheel rims got me looking down
Country boy making noise, world looking now
Might just throw some Ds on it, I got moves to make
On time with these thoroughbreds, my money never late
Don't be bothered with these lames, you should elevate
I got bottles for the popping, maybe we should celebrate
Money over everything, what you know about it?
Bed full of bad bitches, I can't roll up out it
Player you should never doubt it, talking live from the underground
It's forever going down

[Chorus: Big K.R.I.T.]

[Big K.R.I.T.]
This that diamond in the back flow
Bitch, I got enough, I wish you had mo'
Hoe, they used to chunk the deuce and pass go
Now, I'm the one them niggas ask fo' (crooked)
I'm talking dirty, dirty South
Pimps with the curls and the golds in they mouth
Old school cars, doors on slam
Big country girls with the ass like damn (like damn~!)
I'm on it now, I've been a King
Million Man March in my trunk, you hear the dream (you hear it shawty?)
Cornbread pimping, throwing collard greens
Popping my collar feeling clean

[Chorus]

[David Banner]
Twist yo' fingers, make an M and throw your hands up
Twist yo' fingers, make an M and throw your hands up
If you from the South and you proud, nigga go on say it loud
If you a working class nigga, or got slugs in yo' mouth
From the land of the Ku Klux, with no mask
Where my folks think they never had the rebel flag
still flying, bitch you lying, if you say we ain't hanging
from a tree, Frederick Carter, Greenwood, Mississippi
Emmett Till till now, I'ma talk about hoes
Where Medgar Evers got killed in front his family, body froze
Raynard Johnson, Andre Jones, and my folks in these jail cells
They call it suicide cause it's just another black male~! Damn~!

[Chorus]

[Big K.R.I.T.]
Aww sookie, sookie now

[Outro]
"There's the rare occasion when the public can be engaged on a level beyond flash
