Song:   I Ain't the One
Typed by: Cno Evil

[Chorus : sample (Fes Taylor)]
I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be the one (not me)
I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be the one (cuz I ain't going out like that)

[Fes Taylor]
Buying the clothes, designing the toes
Plus, I ain't propose with a diamond and rose
I'm just trying to slide off her clothers, wine her in gold
No you can't spend the night, I ain't lying to hoes
Tell the truth, I ain't looking for a girl or a spouse
Just wanna, nasty broad, let me cum in her mouth
I need a, classy broad, and I'm turning her out
You know, me and the wolves take turns in my house
You got a man, baby daddy, I don't fight over chicks
Hell no, I don't trick, won't light up your wrist
Buy you no kicks, be there, when you crying and shit
Probably try to stroke your cousin, plus eyeing your sis
Tell your moms, no hugs, I ain't trying to kiss
Ain't nobody sugar daddy, just supplying them gifts
Excuse me miss, I'm Shaolin's finest
But still get on some Brooklyn shit, and call you a bitch
I call 'em, slut, hoe, skank
But they still fuck with me, cuz of what's in the bank
They saying, what, oh, wait
But they still lust for me, come fuck with the great, I tell 'em

[Chorus]

[Fes Taylor]
Buying them whips, and buying them tits
You be amazed what these bitches want, asking for shit
Crack a smile, can't hold back from laughing and shit
Cuz back in the days, I gave in to half of this shit
Nowadays ma, you gotta pay for half of the dick
The other half you only get on some passion and shit
They say I need to get my attitude fixed
I had a few bad chicks, I ain't trust 'em for shit
Example; I call this chick up, right, she at her man crib
Dialed the number, memory 2, and rung, he answered it
'Can I speak to Ranitha', 'yeah, she right here'
I'm like 'Ma, I'm downstairs', she like, 'I be right there'
You know it's no such thing as male and female friends
Beat shorty in the CL Benz, look at that
And I'm suppose to let a female in? Why
So she can bring her hair, weaves, and them Lee nails in
I call 'em, slut, hoe, skank
But they still fuck with me, cuz of what's in the bank
They saying, what, oh, wait
But they still lust for me, come fuck with the great, I tell 'em
