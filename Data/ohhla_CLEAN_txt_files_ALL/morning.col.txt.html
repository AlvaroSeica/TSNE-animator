Baby you summertime fine
I'll let you get on top, I'll be the underline I'm
tryin to get beside ya like the number 9, dime; you fine as hell
I guess I met you for a reason, only time can tell
But well, I'm wonderin what type of shit you wantin
Do you like the finer things or you a simple woman?
Would you drink with a nigga? Do you smoke weed?
Don't be ashamed, it ain't no thang, I used to blow trees
gettin lifted, I quit but shit I might get high wit'chu
It's only fittin cause I'm lookin superfly wit'chu
A flower, you are powerful, you do somethin to me
Cause girl I caught the vibe like you threw somethin to me
so I threw 'em back, now all my niggaz hollerin "Who was that?
Oh boy she bad, nigga what you 'bout to do with that?"
I'm finna take you home and sip a lil' Patrón
Now we zonin; baby you're so fine

And can I hit it in the mornin?
Uh, can I hit it in the mornin?
And can I hit it in the mornin?
The sun risin while you're moanin
And can I hit it in the mornin?
Can I hit it in the mornin?
And can I hit it in the mornin?
The sun risin while you're moanin

[Drake]
Uhh, baby you wintertime cold
The night is still young, drink that dinner wine slow
I'm tryin to make the goosebumps on your inner thigh show
I'll let you beat me there as far as finish lines go
Yeah, and if you gotta leave for work 
I'll right here in the same bed that you left me in
I love thick women cause my aunt, she rode equestrian
I used to go to the stables and get them kids to bet me
And I would always ride the stallions whenever she let me
I'm jokin, I mean that thing is pokin
I mean you kinda like that girl that's in the US Open
I mean I got this hidden agenda that you provokin
I got bath water that you can soak in, things I can do with lotion
Don't need a towel, we can dry off in the covers
And when you think you like it I promise you gon' love it
Yeah, when light's comin through the drapes and we're both yawnin
I'll roll over and ask if I can hit it in the mornin

Yeah, can I hit it in the mornin?
Yeah, can I hit it in the mornin?
Yeah, the sun risin while you're moanin
Baby, can I hit it in the mornin?
Uh, can I hit it in the mornin?
Yeah, can I hit it in the mornin?
The sun risin while you're moanin

[J. Cole]
Hey, God bless the child that can hold his own
God bless the woman that can hold Patrón
God bless her homegirl that drove us home
No strings attached like a cordless phone
You see my, intentions wit'chu is clear
I'm learnin not to judge a woman by the shit that she wear
Therefore you shouldn't judge a nigga off the shit that you hear
Get all defensive, apprehensive all because my career
To be fair, I know we barely know each other and yeah
Somehow I wound up in yo' bed, so where we headed from here?
Just say you're scared if you're scared
but if you're through frontin we can do somethin
And you know just what I'm talkin 'bout; tomorrow you'll be callin out
Cause tonight we gettin right until the wee morn'
Cook a nigga breakfast after sex is like a reward
Then I go my own way, you'll think about me all day
That just a warnin

But can I hit it in the mornin?
Can I hit it in the mornin?
Can I hit it in the mornin?
The sun risin while you're moanin
Can I hit it in the mornin?
Can I hit it in the mornin?
And can I hit it in the mornin?
The sun risin while you're moanin
Yeah</pre>
