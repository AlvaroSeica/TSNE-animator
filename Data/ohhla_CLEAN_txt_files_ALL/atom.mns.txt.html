My 4-9-3-11 has fleas cause when I'm kicking the lip service
Someone signs up to rush the potteries
It's automatic and apparent that we have skills in this
But people tend to miss when we shoot the gift
It's not to imitate another in minute
That's slouch life to crush a bad gimmick
We like to shoot the breeze the Main Source way
We don't portray another and never will perpetrate any horseplay
Meaning that if there's a special request
For the Main Source to bite, don't hold your breath
Routines are the lessons, any questions?
We're kicking essence, the Main Source breaks the atom

Since I'm part of the Source others try to find a lunch
And the passengers kicked by me, but I don't crunch
They know what I publish ain't rubbish, it's soon to fit a day
I fine tune kids, two tutor and away
They go through my book, look, pick and snatch
but I can understand cause they create chicken scratch
The center of attention, kids keep snitching
Phoney like an extention, trying to front like they gain attention
But at the same time dumbfounded
They started idolizing the Source as soon as the drums sounded
The Actual's intervened to tell you that I'm...
The Main Source breaks the atom

We're not the best cause no one should be considered a champ
We're the Source and so-called comp will receive a stamp
For playing participation and also for being nosey
The camera's on you, chief, so don't blow it Holmes
By looking and peeking cause if you understand Hell
As quick as I give you howdy I bid you farewell
You'd better think before you break cause if you step to us
That'll be the very last step you take
Consider yourself the outer shell of a dungling part
What we write will bang in your heart
grab your place in line, get your application signed
And in due time you'll find the Main Source breaks atom
