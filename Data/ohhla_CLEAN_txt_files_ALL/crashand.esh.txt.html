[Talking]
As I blaze, can't help but think about my little nephew
My young nigga, Joe Roc, and all the little niggaz
Walkin' the bloody trail, followin' the footsteps of this hell
We call America
 
Young niggaz stay strapped
'Cuz ain't nothin' out here but haters
And snakes, and sinners, and fuckin' perpetrators
Young niggaz stay strapped
'Cuz ain't nothin' out here but fire
And niggaz will kill ya ass quicker than Michael Myers
Young niggaz stay strapped
'Cuz ain't nothin' out here but hustlas
Drugs smugglas, and Reel Life ghetto strugglas
Young niggaz stay strapped
'Cuz ain't nothin' out here but evil
People seekin' 'Redrum' wit' they body leakin'
Young niggaz stay strapped
'Cuz ain't nothin' out here but money
Win or lose fritos up in Detroit casinos
Young niggaz stay strapped
'Cuz ain't nothin' out here but pressure
And niggaz be on the grind like the lookin' for buried treasure
Young niggaz stay strapped
'Cuz ain't nothin' out here but snake bitches
All about they things, don't give a fuck about no niggaz
Young niggaz stay strapped
Even wit' a baby, the mental stress alone will drive your ass crazy
Young niggaz stay strapped
Gotta keep your head together and open up your eyes or be out cold forever
Young niggaz stay strapped
Never bribe to the crime, they can't trace the styles, too hard of a design
Young niggaz stay strapped
Diabolical, biological, DNA, they match ya hair follicle
Young niggaz stay strapped
Police trouble you, CCW, don't be slippin' in the bubble 'cuz ya brain's numb
Young niggaz stay strapped
Warfare be mental and if you get cooked it ain't coincidental
Young niggaz stay strapped
'Till ya getcha play off, offence might blitz so you keep ya sawed-off
Young niggaz stay strapped
Trapped up so you don't get wrapped up in a body bag, fresh ink on ya toe-tag
Young niggaz stay strapped
Through all four seasons, blood money be the reason niggaz triggas be squeezin'
Young niggaz stay strapped
For protection in ya section, I be flexin' a slug and brain connection
Young niggaz stay strapped
For the robbas, and the jackas, and the sneak attackas, ambushes out the bushes
Young niggaz stay strapped
When you gotcha top dropped, gotta keep the glock cocked
No safety, ready to rock
(Ready to rock, stay strapped up) [4x]
 
As I fall, I twist and turn
I fly through the sky, I crash and burn [4x]
 
Young niggaz stay strapped
'Cuz ain't nothin' out here but preachers
Crazy kids in the classrooms gunnin' down the teachers
Young niggaz stay strapped
When you gettin' high, never wonder why people die, killas murder without an alibi
Young niggaz stay strapped
Witcha ammunition 'cuz you just might be on another mission
Young niggaz stay strapped
Ricochet, bullets stray, you might die one day from the evil gun play
Young niggaz stay strapped
'Cuz that's my slogan, when I'm rollin' and controllin', still pistol holdin'
Young niggaz stay strapped
If you wanna stay alive keep a .45 tucked in ya drawers by ya side
Young niggaz stay strapped
Drugs, cocaine, insane, bullet to the brain, no pain no gain
Young niggaz stay strapped
Even when you in the rain, 'Fuck Da Fame', just come and take aim
When the cannons start bustin' all they seen was flames
Young niggaz stay strapped
When the cannons start bustin' all they seen was flames
When the cannons start bustin' all they seen was flames</pre>
