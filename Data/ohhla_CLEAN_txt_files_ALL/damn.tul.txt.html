Typed by: AZ Lyrics

You build me up, to break me down
You fucked me up when you fucked around
Damn

Yes, this is a new day
Yes, this is a new day
Yes, this is my new dress
Yes, this is my new way-ay
I guess I got a new man
And yes I got a new number
I guess that's why you tried to call
And got nothing

Baby you know, baby you know
Just get it boy, it's a new me
Baby you know, baby you know
Just get it boy, it's a new me

You build me up, to break me down
You fucked me up when you fucked around
Damn damn damn damn

My heart's going under, blinded
Can you see her, can you find it?
You're looking at their brand new
Version of me, me
I guess this is my new voice
A new familiar noise
Just don't try to follow the sound
You're searching for nothing

Baby you know, baby you know
Just get it boy, it's a new me
Baby you know, baby you know
Just get it boy, it's a new me

You build me up, to break me down
You fucked me up when you fucked around
Damn damn damn damn

Baby you know, baby you know
Just get it boy, it's a new me
Baby you know, baby you know
Just get it boy, it's a new me

You build me up, to break me down
You fucked me up when you fucked around
Damn damn damn damn</pre>
