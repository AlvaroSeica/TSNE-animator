[Reef the Lost Cauze]
Yup! A.O.T.P., JuJu Mob
Reef the Lost Cauze, Snowgoons, another class
This for all you hatin-ass bastards
This what I tell 'em nowadays

Yo, yo, from the city of Godless, Philly the hardest
It don't matter what I say they wouldn't kill me regardless
They say I'm a MC but really an artist
Simply DaVinci, peep your paint and draw it
But I'm not animated like a cartoon
My posessed work, spear your flesh like harpoon
All you, are now in tune, to the illest MC's
Try to mimic but don't sound as cool
How can you dupe a dummy, astound a fool
Spit so much, you will drown in drool
You're a bunch of clowns and coons that'll get found in dunes
A plastic hammer, basically a childish tool
You wild as who; I defile your crew
You must be trippin like a thousand 'shrooms - I'm the truth
You're the lie in the flesh, I put tires to neck
They describe you as sex, I'm as live as it gets
PUSSY~! Stop gettin your words tangled
Fuck around and just get your whole earth mangled
You be the first strangled, I come to your show
Beat you down and then kill it at your merch table

[Chorus]
You can hate all you want, you will never beat it
You can fake all you want, you will never beat it
You can wait all you want, you will never see it
You talk a lot of shit, but you ain't never mean it
You starvin out here dawg, you are never eatin
I'm walkin out here dawg, we are never leavin
You hold a gun and get chunked, you will never squeeze it
I had a gun all my life, and I ain't never need it

[Reef the Lost Cauze]
I walk a strip that's narrow with a clique of pharoahs
Splits fifths and barrels in sick apparel
Kids is scarecrows
I roll with Snowgoons and they don't sing Christmas carols
No Frosty or Rudolph, you awfully and too soft
You fuckin SUCK, you lost me at two bars
All I got in this world, a word and two balls
I'm in the wilderness, spitting moose calls
I am vermouth raw, you're a goofball
That's why no one knows who the fuck you are
I don't own a new car, I'm too far ahead of the traffic
I'm beheadin you bastards
With the most majestic of magic, well not really
But you all gettin your ass kicked
I spit battle raps to no one in particular
Just to do it and to remind MC's that I'm ill as fuck
The killer cuz, with a killer buzz
I'm high, plus on the streets I got a killer buzz
Copped your CD I feel you cuz, it's feeler music
Now I know what they mean by filler, what

[Chorus]

[Reef]
Never, never, no, never
Never, never
Snowgoons, Reef the Lost Cauze
We got another one
This need to be the fuckin, lead-off single and shit with the video
F'real, y'understand
Ain't nobody fuckin with this man, you know that
HAHAHA, I'm just playin - well not really
But I'm... I'M OUT~!!!</pre>
