When I roll up
Straight sittin' on dubs
20 inches baby gotta show me love
Candy paint rag-top and you know it got the green
In and outta lanes straight swerving man
It's the B-O-to the double B-Y
Charter to the game when I'm passing by
I stay iced out and hella clean
From the neck to the wrists Im gon' bling bling
Run through them hoes like ol' clothes
Sittin' in my low and I'ma bout to get blowed
Females keep it comin' like E-mail
Brake em off some top like Le Nail
Then you know how these rats come back
I'm like a chronic sack when I spit to call em back
Now ballers throw your hands up
If you chip me a cup and you gettin' bup

[Chorus: DTTX]
When I roll up, straight sittin' on dubs
20 inches baby gotta show me love
Candy paint rag-top and you know it got the green
In and outta lanes straight swerving man
2x

Now who then wanna ride with me
In a 2 g got the big body
I'm a hot boy that loves to shine
And all you playa haters can't stop mine
Sittin' on chrome gettin' my roll on
Behind limo ten gettin' my smoke on
Now what's up, wanna slide through
Cause I'm gone up the chronic in the nighty crew
Got big game, spit game
Me and my dawg we rollin' around doin' big thangs
Got 6 hon and it's sittin' on blade
Skating through the city like the ice capait
Now you know all them hunches wanna talk
Everytime you me mashing up the block
And all the playa haters, wanna ball the block
But I'm the #1 stunner and I call the shots

[Chorus]
When I roll up, straight sittin' on dubs
20 inches baby gotta show me love
Candy paint rag-top and you know it got the green
In and outta lanes straight swerving man
2x

[Royal T]
It's a party when I hit your town
Everybody know how it goin down
Cause you know that I know
That a party aint a party without a freak show
Caught up in the club gettin' hella chrunk
Out in the park gettin hella drunk
And a VIP crystalin' now
?? panties straight fallen now
All up in your mind cause I'm iced out
Gangs all up tight, I'm turn dikes out
Then I hit her before the nights out
To break me off when the lights out
Cause a party aint a party till the panties drop
So baby don't front, show me what you got
Cause you know, don't try to act dumb
A party aint a party till the homies get some

[Chorus]
When I roll up, straight sittin' on dubs
20 inches baby gotta show me love
Candy paint rag-top and you know it got the green
In and outta lanes straight swerving man
