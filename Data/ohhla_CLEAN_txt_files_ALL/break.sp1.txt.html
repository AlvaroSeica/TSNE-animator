[ Mc Ant ]
Aiyyo Spice all these rich motherfuckers keep going to
the record stores buyin these fake ass raps
You know what I'm sayin ?

[ Spice 1 ]
Yeah , Yeah
I hear you byte all that fake shit
Niggas need to get up on the hardcore shit
You know what I'm sayin ?

[ Mc Ant ]
Ay , man , you still got the Ski mask and them Gats
I'm ready to jack these motherfuckers
I'm ready to break this up

[ Spice 1 ]
Yeah , fuck that
Lets handle that business
Huh , yeah

[ Mc Ant ]
We gotta flow sumptin funky

[ SPICE 1 ]
Check it
Spice 1 is fuckin it up upon the flow
And if you got the static motherfucker we can go
My homie Ant Banks got the bass line thumpin 
Stop a nigga heart cause my mouth is a guage pumpin
Spice is on the one and Ant is on the two
But ya'll don't kick it yet because a nigga just ain't trough
Comin hard as fuck I be like acin and I'm icin
Steppin into the ring fuckin 'em up like Michael Tyson
Gimme all your cash 
Cause I'm about to blast
And bust 50 bullets in your motherfuckin ass
Niggas think I'm crazy cause I'm poppin off at the mouth
And plus I had the chopper pointed at your damned house
My name is Spice 1 I be a vicious motherfucker
Get you for a key and leave you lyin in the gutter
And if you think its possible to harm 'em
I be stickin my foot up in your ass like it was [ ? ]
So nigga brake yourself and buy the motherfuckin tape
The beat'll fuck your ears like a statuatory rape
Murderous nigga on the gangsta tip
So Mc Ant cover me while I reload the motherfuckin clip
And by the way if you want your life don't take yourself 
Buy the dope ass record and brake yourself
Huh, yeah
You know what I'm sayin ?
Got Mc Ant in the motherfuckin house
He came to break these motherfuckers 
Load the clip and handle your business partner

[ MC ANT ]
A-N-T is like a motherfuckin pro in it
Niggas didn't know that I kick it funky and flow wit it
Straight up out the O-K-L-A-N-D
Coolin all the bitches when I be on the late night tweak
Who's that on the corner be stoppin and starin to makin 'em stutter
Was that Mc Ant the rip-a-rappin motherfucker
187 with the 211 and progress
So get out the shit break bitch because I'll just
Pistol whip your ass and slam the tape
I pop if you wanna brake and dump you off in the lake
Run if you dumb dick I'm quick to pop the clip 
Slip if you wanna slip, I'm tough and won't even trip
Don't move and you won't get hurt
Take off your motherfuckin clothes and put your face in the dirt
This is a genuine gank move bitch
So give me your money and your jewels and make me rich
Another nigga might play it on a cool tip
But Ant and Spice won't be takin no bullshit
Everything nigga even your gold tooth
I knock the motherfucker lose if you want prove
Cause I'm down for the mail
And if it's worth the jail I'm out on bail
If it ain't given I'll straight up take your wealth
Tell a motherfucker straight up brake yourself
Yeah
And thats how we run that shit on this motherfuckin stage right now
You know what I'm sayin ?
Ay, Spice
I want you to step to 'em and kick it one more time 
With that gangsta shit

[ SPICE 1 ]
Check it
It's like a G-O , and I kick in a bankin a motherfucker 
So stop at the red light and I just wanted a battle
Another rich ass nigga on a ego tip
Give up the rolex watch [???] bitch
And have ya both in the back of a black hearse
Bitch if you want your life give me your fuckin purse
This is a HALLOWEEN trick or treat
But if you trick you get beat shut up left dead in the street
Cause 187 is runnin shit up in the house
Down to shoot you in your motherfuckin mouth
And Mc Ant of O-A-K-L-A-N-D
Is with the faculty and S-P-I-C-E
So put the goodies inside the bag
This ain't a lolly gag stick in my clip and raise him up out his jag 
I let the motherfuckin 9 click 
Comin at our dome kickin funky gangsta shit
So nigga empty your pocket pull out your bank roll
Try to be a hero and let us nut up your ass hole
Cause Arnold Schwarzenegger just play parts
But I specialize in stoppin nigga's hearts
187 is sendin niggas to ghetto heaven
We beat the funk out your eardrums and keep it revin
So don't pound too hard and fuck up your health
And by the way drop the Abraham Lincolns and brake yourself

[ Mc Ant ]
Yeah 
Motherfucker you wanna spent that money on that bass hip
You wanna get the bomb baby

[ Spice 1 &amp; Mc Ant ]
Yeah , nigga brake yourself and get with the real shit
Yeah , nigga , Mc Ant and Spice in the house
with Ant Banks on the tracks
Yeah , Ant Banks in the motherfuckin house
187 motherfucker
Goin out to all you motherfuckers 
We got the dope shit
Bustin caps in your motherfuckin eardrums
Straight jackin it , I'm out</pre>
