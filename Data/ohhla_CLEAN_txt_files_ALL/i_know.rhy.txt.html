[Verse 1: Skirmish]
My whole life I was lied to 
That's the reason I've spent most of my whole life trying to find truth
I'm suicidal, headed for my grave
When I put the blades edge onto my veins
Ignoring anything they say, all the jealousy and hate
My character get judged from expressions on my face [Foreal]
I'm thinking back and remembering the days 
But eventually my memories will fade
And since entering the game [I know]
Things will never be the same, the world gets pleasure from my pain
My girl left and everything has changed
Now my blood boils with every mention of her name [It's that deep]
I'm torn between a devil and a saint 
Now there's countless doubts about myself embedded in my brain
And I'm going crazy
Surrounded by loved one's but I'm the only person that I know that hates me
Killing me inside, thinking I'm alive
Living just to die
Wanted to give up, pick up, run from home
Uncontrolled was such in rush to grow
There are so many people in life that come and go
Very few people in life that touch your soul
So, by giving up I'm letting myself down
I question myself, am I heaven or hell bound

[Chorus]

[I know...]
That life's hard and it keeps getting harder
I got questions I'm seeking an answer
The truth hiding deeper and darker

[I know...]
That life's hard and it keeps getting harder
I got questions I'm seeking an answer
The truth hiding deeper and darker

[Verse 2: Psiklone]
My soul died the day I opened my eyes
Exposing the lies and realised this world is colder than ice
I try to take control of my life
But gotta go with flow cos I know it's like the roll of a dice 
Lost all hope multiple times
But I'm soldiering by cos I know it's my goal to survive
Most of the night I lie awake facing the ceiling
Can't fall asleep torn between angels and demons
I'ma walk till I fall to my knees
And if I fall I will stand tall like a man born to succeed
Won't forfeit my dreams cos their worth the patience
I take the burning hatred and turn it straight into determination
The universe is supersized
While our planets stupid curse is more human wrongs than human rights
Religion's playing games
It's the opium of the masses, so I take the lords name in vein
We're all blind and cloaked in darkness
It's a straight fact that nobody knows the answers
Some trust in a holy father cos they were baptized
Shame they need to fear God just to act right
I guess that's life, its strangely tragic
Just when you taste the magic, before you know it fades to blackness
No one can know the facts
But one things certain, nothing's gonna hold me back

[Repeat Chorus]

[Verse 3: Possessed]
In my life compassion is scarce 
I'm trapped and ensnared in this superficial Vanity Fair
Where tyranny reigns
I'm not comforted by phrases like "God works in mysterious ways"
Hope deteriorates, the poor are getting poorer
Submerged tenth, we're stuck treading water
Depressive aura and corruption in the hearts of men
Watching as half my friends turn into Harvey Dents
Will I suffer in silence (No)
Born with half the blood but none of the luck of the Irish
And I need radical changes
Couldn't see the writing on the wall cos my back was against it 
I hate this not thinking positively
When we're taught with no college degrees, tomorrow is bleak
I don't know what to believe
God don't offer relief, the Devil keeps following me
So, are there angels above?
I pray for heavens inhabitants, hope that their praying for us 
Depression, it runs in my genes
No matter race, colour or creed we, struggle to breathe
And underachieve
Alcohol arranged a meeting between my uncle and the cousin of sleep
Suicide the numbers increase
When I go the whole fucking globes coming with me so

[Repeat Chorus]</pre>
