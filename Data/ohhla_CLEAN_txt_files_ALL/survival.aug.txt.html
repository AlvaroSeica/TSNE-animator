Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Rolling with, my niggas in the four door
Serving cause we're trying to get this cash flow
Stacking till we pullin' up in the narrow
Rolling out, blowing out, talking bout how one day
We'll be ballin out
Same shit it's just a different day
Same old niggas hustling
Tryin to make a way
Same lame haters always signing shit the same
If a niggas dying man I swear this shit is crazy
Anything about this other niggas
I don't give a fuck about'em
I ain't fucking with'em
When they stepping out of line
I got a problem with'em
When you know I'm down to ride
And quick to pull the trigger

I wonât let nobody talk about my niggas
I'm riding for my niggas
You can't run up on my niggas
Less you try to have an issue
Cause I'm loyal to my niggas
That's the way I gotta be
So fuck them other niggas
My niggas will die for me
Just me and my niggas, yeah
Just me and my niggas, yeah
Just me and my niggas, yeah
Just me and my niggas, yeah
It's survival of the fittest

Same shit it's just a different day
Same old niggas hustling tryin to make a way
Same lame haters always signing shit the same
If a nigga is dying man I swear this shit is crazy

But I don't let nobody talk about my niggas
I'm riding for my niggas
You can't run up on my niggas
Less you try to have an issue
Cause I'm loyal to my niggas
That's the way I gotta be
So fuck them other nigga
My niggas will die for me
Just me and my niggas, yeah
Just me and my niggas, yeah
Just me and my niggas, yeah
I'm just trying to get it
Just me and my niggas, yeah
Just me and my niggas, yeah
Just me and my niggas, yeah
It's survival of the fittest</pre>
