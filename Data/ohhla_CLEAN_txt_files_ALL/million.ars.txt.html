[Chorus: Swel Boogie + Q-Unique]
WHO WANTS TO BE A MILLIONAIRE?
Don't worry now just take your time
You have your water, your wife, plus three life lines
WHO WANTS TO BE A MILLIONAIRE?
Get it right and for sure you'll be proud
And if you need help you can even ask the heads in the crowd
WHO WANTS TO BE A MILLIONAIRE?
Questions like these can take for weeks
But for 30 seconds you can call one of your peeps
WHO WANTS TO BE A MILLIONAIRE?
But get it wrong, and you'll lose your cash
So I advise you, split the answer half and half

[host

What up playas and playettes, and studio audience guests?
You tuned into the show that got you thinkin for the dough
One million in cash if the right answer match
You can spend it in the clubs or save it in a stash
Our first contestant:
	Worf outta Borath
	Who hate half ass niggaz, he spit a lot so build a raft
Contestant number two:
	I'm mister Quiles from the Bronx
	Where rap first got its props and street kids open barber shops
Our third contestant:
	From Bushwick Brooklyn, better known as Crooklyn
	Swel Boogie, he'll keep you lookin
Well then, now that we met our three contestants
