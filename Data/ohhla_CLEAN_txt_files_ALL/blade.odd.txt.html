[Earl Sweatshirt]
Sweatshirt, Domo Genesis, throwin chairs, killin shit
I'm half-privileged, think white and have nigger lips
A tad different; mad smart, act ignorant
Shit I'll pass the class when my dad starts givin shits
But as long as our relationship is turdless
I'ma keep burnin rubber and fuckin these beats with burnt dick
Who that? Oh, that new coon John Cusack
A Mecca button-up, shoutin bring FUBU back
Hands full of coke, mouth full of crack mu-zak
Odd Future on the doo-rag, guess who's back?
With no hint, we're eggin with no tint
Plus there's a shotgun under the seat where your hoe sits
Uhh, the night striker, I'm ridin her, up-tyin her
There's nine Vicodins stuck inside of the windpipes of her
A little bit of sherm sure provokes the fuckin fight in her
She started bitin cause I'm givin cock like it's advice to her
Take that, I'm on top like wave caps
This is grade A rap, Domo bring that bass back

Nigga, um
Domo couldn't be here so um
We're just, um
{*falls over*}
Aw cuz fell on the floor cuz
I ain't caught him
Police make niggaz act like healthy but when they hurt </pre>
