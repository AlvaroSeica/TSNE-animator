Mmm..
I'm steppin up Sutton, headed for this get together
Weather was fierce, no sweat, I had on a rugged leather
Got to the subway station on Archer
And noticed that the train was about, to make a rapid departure
Fuck that, ain't no Jakes up here in the station
Pulled the turnstyle back slipped through with no hesitation
The bitch in the booth yelled pay your fare, I said yeah I oughta
Threw the finger up and said, owe ya a buck and a quarter
Jettin for the train, before that shit got ghost
And as I'm runnin down the steps, I spots two five-oh
They was jettin too, guess them niggaz had seen me ha?
Man fuck a cop, I wasn't even tryin to stop
The conductor saw me boogeyin, and still closed the shit up
And I spit in his face, before the train had time to get up
Heard a Jake yell STOP!  I said pssh, stop deez
Caught my breath on the steps and got lost in the breeze
Headed down towards the J, hopin to make a getaway
and I see the same two cops on me yo, these niggaz ain't playin
Bumped an old lady, think I knocked her old ass down
Screamed SORRY MISS without tryin to turn around
Catchin mad looks and stares, as I hustled up the stairs
Please let the gate be open, and I'm up and outta here
As I approach the gate the cop still on the chase
God damn it's locked, aiyyo I can fit through that space
But what about the leather the gear and the Timbs you sportin
Won't they get dirty?  Fuck that, my ass is more important
As I went under I heard STOP OR I'LL FIRE
But I kept goin and thought, pssh yeah right fuckin liar
For a dollar twenty-five ain't no way they gonna blast me
Til I heard a shot and felt the bullet fly right past me
Yo!  What kind of shit is these pigs gettin with?
I was flippin script, but gotta admit I was shittin bricks
Hit the pavement as a bullet struck the wall beside me
My mind was in disarray, so I let my feet guide me
Got my thoughts together and it became mad clear
There was more than just me and fare bein involved here
But I couldn't figure that shit out for nothin
And didn't have time to stop and think, I just kept on struttin
Out like VRRRM, like a cartoon character caper
Jettin so fast Flash ass woulda caught the vapors
Hit a corner and looked back, damn they still sweatin me
I kept jettin G, ain't no fuckin way they was gettin me
Ran across the ave without checkin what color the light was
And got hit kinda hard by an old beat up white Dodge
But not nearly hard enough to stop my mission
Even though I didn't know my leg was in bad condition
The pain wasn't alla that as I kept up my speedin
But I was in need of a doctor for mass internal bleeding
My side felt kinda sore, my left arm felt dead
Put my hand into my jacket, it came out blood red
Pushed a kid he broke like WATCH WHERE YOU GOIN MOTHERFUCKER
Couldn't riff with that brother so I said, yo, your mother
Heard a siren then another then spots a blue and white
U-turned and ran round a corner til they was outta sight
Ran through a vacant lot, heard a shot pop then, pop pop pop pop
Oh shit, they got glocks?
Fled past a bunch of girls, but couldn't stop to peep booties
Was tired and fucked up, but I continued my duty
Pretty soon I was exhausted tellin self you lost kid
But if they was bustin at me I knew I get tossed an shit
Wasn't tryin to go upstate or to Riker's
So I took a breath and kept makin like my ass was on fire
Felt like I had lost ALL the blood in my body
I'd give anything to be laid up in the crib with a hottie
Stomach was doin flip-flops, all twisted and knotty
Next time I'm payin, this ain't my idea of a party
Aww shit!  A squad car is block my path
Turn around and there's a bunch of cops right at my ass
Went to take my hand out my jacket to give up
Musta thought I was pullin out, no wait don't shoot I'm just..
The lady I had bumped fell, hit the third rail
But I didn't do no time, I never made it to jail
I often think I'd still be alive with my friends
if only I had came up off a dollar, and twenty-five cents</pre>
