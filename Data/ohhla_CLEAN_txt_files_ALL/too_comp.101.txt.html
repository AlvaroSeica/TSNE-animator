[Scratch Chorus]
"Greater than your Benz or your Lex" - De La Soul 'The Bizness'

[Verse One]
Deep in the depths of the mind
The pro is prime, trapped like a mime
In the same space and time, lifeless
Vocals excel when trifers
Centerfold of your ciphers
My aura shines divine, priceless
Much to complex to yap
Maybe perhaps when I think of rap
My thinkin' cap (what?)
Reveals the skills unlimited
Rappers be half as great
Mentally they can't elaborate
So they exaggerate and fabricate
My words collaborate, formulatin' a sentence
It's all ill when the blunted mind defense this
Intense mechanism 
Respect next to wisdom
Makes the god's mental
Inflammable grammable feel gentile
Reignin' dominate
We be the essential
I sense y'all don't know the art
Comprehensively, energy enters me when I depart
It's like sweet sorrow
Bottles I follow catch wreck
Engine's to my comprehension be just too complex
To get vex and just step
I'd rather snatch a rapper's rep
Ruin it to a degree
Breakin' them into debris
Vocally, y'all label me as the illest mic killa
Top biller
Still in the grind, the mind driller
Sublime thriller
Poetically is how I'm depicted
The rhythm's got me addicted so my ill skill inflicts it
On any device
Nice
Similar, the verbal Christ
Enormous, my performance equally will be precise
We puttin' rappers on ice
The ultimate heist
Most of 'em should have thought twice now they're payin' the price
I knock 'em out like Mic Tys when the tracks connect
The engine's to my comprehension is just too complex

[Scratch Chorus]
"Greater than your Benz or your Lex
The engine to my comprehension is just too complex" - De La Soul 'The Bizness'
Much too complex 
"Greater than your Benz or your Lex
The engine to my comprehension is just too complex"

[Verse Two]
To M.C. the art of rhymin' should be pure and natural
When I think of all these ill skills, international
You see my words in actual will attract the steel like a magnet
Niggas is stagnant and incomplete like the fragments
Actually, my words are a jagged edge, criminal
Borderline, subliminal
One of the earth's finest minerals
I'm past the pinnacle 
And still I hold my fort like a general
Intervals, all excerpt the maximum
Release the minimal energy
Cock me back 
Hennesy's sure to blur the memory
Remember me, that ill nigga?
I still trigger
Thoughts sporadic set to peel niggas
Standards
Mics are metaphors of what the man is, might merge
I recite slurs with the right words
What occurs when I conjure
Illest spirits from beyond ya
You was warned like Alaja
The drama ganja drains away 
Plain as day
When my mind's A.K. spray in the A.K.A.
Nine trey, double rays, bubble thin
Fry
Mass murderous
The illest niggas we devour from out the dark
So kill the talk
Either that or walk the walk
You claim you had your shit together now it's fallin' apart
Lyin' lion, no heart
Who woulda thought you'd be wack?
We gave you dap in the beginning now we takin' it back
I only boogie from a track when mad niggas react
We specify the artifacts and represent 'em on wax
It' complex 

[Scratch Chorus]
"Greater than your Benz or your Lex
The engine to my comprehension is just too complex" - De La Soul 'The Bizness'
Much too complex
"Greater than your Benz or your Lex
The engine to my comprehension is just too complex
Much too complex"

[Verse Three]
Let's take a deep breath and inhale and exhale
For those who prison in the minds and those that been bailed
Fuck the fan shit, it's about to hit the windmills
What I reveal, not omni still it's strictly been real
Y'all know the deal, skills
Steelos, alter egos
Poetry hits my peoples like food for thought
Vocals distort, shorts the sequels
Mics forever like the paradox of pure evil
The crowds will come
Like throwin' crumbs to the seagulls
Too predictable
Old folks pray in cathedrals
Tryin' to live that better life legal
Feeble, my mind remains haunted by mad things
I'm wanted
Plus everything is real when you're blunted
These days the trees blaze
F doin' the shade
We backspin 'em like the DJs
Playa be swaze
I'm the live one
Mic's like a knife
Cuttin' you down to size in 
The fantasy land you and your mans was devisin'
We wise men
Puzzle your thoughts
It ain't surprisin'
I set it off like horizons
No mistakes allowed
Strategically, it's like I'm movin' the crowd
I'm lickin' shots, bustin' up at the clouds
We be audacious, treadin' on glaciers
Slang got sprayed down in Tanqueray without the chasers
On the earth there ain't a place you can run to hide
When my sets collide with your planet
Rock bottom solid my frame be like granite
Very few can understand it
The dialect I wreck
Perfects my mic's sex when the thoughts connect
The engine to my comprehension is just too complex
The engine to my comprehension is just too [echo]
