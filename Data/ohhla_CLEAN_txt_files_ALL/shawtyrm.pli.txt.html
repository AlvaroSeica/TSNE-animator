[Intro - Plies, (Pleasure sings "Look at my shawty" in the background)] 
Plies baby
Let me see if I can do it again homie
This time I'ma do it with my lil' homie Pleasure and Trey Songz on this one baby

[Chorus - Pleasure]
You got me saying my, my, my, my, my, my, my
Shawty looks good tonight
Look at my shawty, look at my shawty, look at my shawty
From the first time we made love, I knew you was my shawty 
And when I did that bid, you always had my back, cause you are my shawty 
That's why I don't mind caking up with you, cause you are my shawty 
And girl I love all the freaky things we do, shawty 

[Verse 1 - Plies]
I don't call her shawty no more, I call her my bust it baby 
Told her she ever let me fuck, I was gon run her crazy 
Gave her some of this sweet meat, now I got her cravin'
Felt sorry for my baby, how I left her shakin' 
Told her don't move, let me wipe you off baby 
Kissed her in her mouth and told her I love she take it
Put her head on my chest and fell asleep naked 
She was shy when I met her, now she participatin' 
Keep the lights on, so I can see she amazin' 
Sexy as hell, I love to watch her while she bathin' 
Come and wake me up to help her when she shavin'
She my bust it baby, she smiles when I say it 

[Chorus - Trey Songz]
My, my, my, my, my, my, my 
Shawty looks good tonight 
Look at my shawty, look at my shawty
From the first time we made love, I knew you was my shawty 
And when I did that bid, you always had my back, you are my shawty 
Thats why I don't mind caking up with you, cause you are my shawty 
Girl I love all the freaky things we do, shawty 

[Verse 2 - Plies] 
You know she bad, cuz she walk with her nose in the air 
She fine in everything, don't even matter what she wear 
To get her started, I just run my fingers through her hair 
You know it's mine, cuz she let me give it to her bare 
I broke bread with her, just to show her a goon care 
What I love about her, baby she turn me on anywhere 
You know she bad, she fuckin' you can't help but stare 
I know I had her when she told me, baby I don't share 
I told her me neither, I don't put my tongue everywhere 
She ask me was it good to me, I told her hell yeah 
I had to teach her a lil' bit, I took her from a square 
I put my stamp on it, it's all mine, I made it clear 

[Chorus - Trey Songz and Pleasure]
My, my my, my, my, my, my 
Shawty looks good tonight
Look at my shawty, look at my shawty
From the first time we made love, I knew you was my shawty  
And when I did that bid, you always had my back, you are my shawty
Thats why I don't mind caking up with you, cause you are my shawty
And girl I love all the freak things we do, shawty

[Outro - Pleasure (x2)]
Shawty we can do it all night, we can do it all day 
Shawty won't you come and let me get some of your foreplay 
We can do it all night, we can do it all day, shawty</pre>
