Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Can't nobody tell me shit
I'm flyer than a bitch
Man I'm flyer than my bitch
So you can say I'm cocky I'm confident
But don't let a nigga tell you
You ain't the shit (haha)
See see yous a got damn lie
Some nigga tellin me I anit that fly
Get a lint brush take ya clothes to the cleaners
Get a couple bucks get the vans the cleanest
Yeah $35.99 but to tell the truth
You don't need a dime to shine
Cus the real shine comes from wats inside insecurities and egos put that aside
Maybe you could realy find you a friend who ride
And you feel so fly that you might can glide
The morals of the world which you must abide
Ss to the death for the pack I ride like

Fly, don't let nobody tell you you ain't fly
You go keep yo head up in the sky
Dreams are the things that never die
Why why am I so fly

[Lil B]
Cleaner than west baby fly as my sweater
Don't let nobody tell you different
Yeah wat ever, I think different
Anit scared to be different
I dress different than you I got differnt visions
And lite the same shit yeah it's differnt pimpin
Don't be scared like wateva it's wateva
You don't like me I don't care I anit stressin
Prolly need me like salad with the dressin
Haters they mad like that's their profession
Put my work in I can talk about my blessins
Thank god I stay fly like the jetsons
Thank god I saty fly like the jetsons
Retro pimpin ya boy 87
Bounced back twice with the help of a revrene
Keep these fuckin niggas guessin yeah

[Lil Uno]
Have you ever heared of fly young pimpin
Look in webster I'm the definition
Fly guy fly whip always in a fly whip
That get a fly bitch always givin me tips
It's a cold world so I'm a ice box
And the wolfpack how you like that
Sippin belvy diamonds for the ice yes
Hit the sun lite drippin like a foset
I'm a idle something like a trensay
Gun on the hip get buff like a bench press
You don't want it with the kid I'm a quick draw
Draw put you on my word call it clip art
Got a girlfriend nickname cool whip
Why? cus she rides like a new whip
Smoove cool and it look good
I see that yeah gimme that

[Stunna]
Who eva would of thought I'd be stuntin likd this
Who eva would of thought I'd be snatchin yo chick
Stunna man say the boy move sick
I ride big whips and I stack big chips
Stay away from the fakes cus the haters anit shit
Stay high yea I be so fly
Purple in my blunt boy I be so high
You see the strecth hummer yea that's up all night
I remeber when I used to dream look at the sky
Now I sit in 1st sit and look down from the sky
Dayum now that's a transition
Shout out to my homie shorty help me with pimp
