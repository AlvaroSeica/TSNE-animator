Still... whippin the Chevy, still gettin my tipped licked
When I'm ready I still fall up in the party like confetti
It's still Madd Rappers, +D. Dot Angelettis+
Still just as skinny as you met me
Still keep it real, never will let another disrespect me
For real, 'til deep in peace they rest me
Still smoke sess cause I swear that they stress me
And when I'm home a lot, keep the chrome a lot
Cause even when I'm home I'm knowin there's a lot of dudes
that like the fact I'm blowin
Like some runnin shoes on the track I'm goin
Tell these other dudes they slack I'm sewin
So don't get hemmed up, I think Timbed up
Cause in my mind it's the wintertime all the time on my grind
Tell 'em I'ma rhyme, told 'em that the sing got me signed
Try to put me in a box I will not stay there
And if I fall I will not lay there
Grown man, this is not day care
A big boy game, they do not play fair
But I still keep it trill and I got to share
Still uncomfortable if cops is there
My fam still disfunctional, we not repaired
Still got rhymes out the asshole
Still wonder why are they mad fo'
Cause I'm in the hood like the crack coke diesel, ask yo people
Trey still do it for the people
Ride with so many straps the whole fuckin car is illegal
Still pick good over evil
Still play the Jesus, and it's wild cause I'm still sinnin
Addiction still weed-puffin, givin it to women
It's still my brain ready to bust up out my skull
to the mic, cause my mouth don't be sayin shit right
They sayin shit like, "I don't be killin it"
You niggaz is ridiculous, eat a dick with some syphillis
Y'all slow, still I done sucked it up
Drake tell 'em what the fuck is up

[Drake]
Look - I used to cut the porch lights on; and now I cut the porch lights on
just to let 'em know they foresight's wrong
Where this nigga goin with that obscure ice on?
He just lame, I'm tryin to get my mature life on
I asked what happened, no one's handin in, handin in
Hop up out the passenger and help me back thePphantom in
Damn, I never got to use that in a convo
Never got the chance to put you back in a condo
And, and, it couldn't be more true
I always meant to get you that villa in Corfu
Women I pass off, and money I tore through
Now all I really need is the number before 2
Is it over? Tell me it isn't over
They told me it was easy as I get a little older; yeah right
And this is what my life outro sound like
Even though Dre did it, the shit don't sound right
I was, born to do it, born to make bar music
I flow tight like I was born Jewish
Well, actually I was born Jewish
I guess at this point you could say I was born foolish - ha ha
Yea, what about the Grammys and the bubbly?
What about all my fans that be lovin me?
I, used to chill in them spots where the trouble be
But never ended up in that menage at the Double Tree
What about that girl Rita down in Basque
in a lace where I woulda never cheated on yo' ass
But you ain't give me yo' number cause them niggaz got to fightin
Situation got me thinkin and that's when I got to writin
Hmm; change these hundreds for me cashier
Cause I ain't made it but I'm better off than last year
Yeah - and what it look like hun?
I never got to make it rain but it looked like fun
And uh, a king is what I'm fit to be
I don't get these niggaz they a mystery
I mean they talk so quiet as if it's in private
And they don't ever bring that shit to me, but
Man I ain't live life so wrong
I said fuck a couple dudes, cause I ain't like yo' song
Least let me tell you why I'm this way, hold on </pre>
