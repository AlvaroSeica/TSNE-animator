Song:   Mental Stamina
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

Yo Afu (Yo whassup?)
Yo yo, c'mere c'mere
Yo let's freak that rhyme we was freakin the other night
(Yo I'm wit it yo just set it off)
I'm sayin though, after this, it's no turnin back 'Fu
(Aiyyo just set it off man)

Pugilistic linguistics, check out the mystics, we're fantistic
        You mean fantastic
Fuck it, you'll get your ass kicked
Challenge my verbal gymnastics
        Vanacrobatics
Vocabulary calisthenics
Can't understand the mathematics are esoteric
Watch the style but also peep the lyrics, my lightning, my thunder
Way back I stomped out Her-cu-les
But now I stomp out MC's
Can't chill, because the Sun don't freeze
Heavy metal, hard like titaniam
Alchemist, I turn wax into platinum

[Afu Ra]
Influential, scientifical power
My mental violence will shower
Devour at a crazy rate, I speed into your circuits
and incorporatin data banks
Stamina, in the brain is how I slay it
I enforce my voice and I always must obey it
Endorsing a central rhyme of remedies
Against any man at arms that can get with thee
Eternal, internal, alchemist, I spill
logic and science ever since
Throwing cerebral blows without my fist
Poisonous, Taoist
Don't mess with toys in this racket
Terrorists don't proceed to hi-jack it

[Jeru]
It's too perverted, you heard it, so now you get murdered
Test the sound system, it throws off your equilibrium
Deep concentration can't fracture the meditation
Competition is flipped on at random
Deviant monks attack the mic is mental pandemonium
And then some, you go for your hand gun
Psychokinetic forces proceed to smash in your cerebellum
Phonetian with more stamina than a Christian
my mind, C3 H5 N3 O9 like Nitroglycerine
I bust as Afu Ra crush
Clash with us and meet Cerebus

[Afu-Ra]
Ready, ridiculous rabbitry, as I commence
I whirlwind through cities
Breaking down substances, combining matter
Test my hand skills and back bones splatter
Rough and tough although the mental will stomp ya
Pugilism electrocute like Blanka
Collaborate, all my words into verses
I instill the will without even curses
Slurs, escapade off the beat
Totally complete with the unique physique
Microcosmic warrior, indeed I'll destroy ya
And this mic, I'm taking over</pre>
