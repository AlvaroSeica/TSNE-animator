Ay girl, yeah you the business, so what the bid'ness?
Don't be shy, I'm just talkin to you girl
Hey ma, yo where yo' man at? I know you got that

He at home, but he done fucked up, I swooped his girl up
And what I'm 'bout to do he'll feel I did him wrong
Cause, I'm 'bout to have a ménage-à with his lady
and some freaks at the bar, who like fuckin with a star
I told her

[Chorus: Usher]
If you're fuckin with me, really fuckin with me
You go get some girls and, bring 'em to me
If you're fuckin with me, really fuckin with me
You'll let her put her hands in your pants, be my little freak (yeah)
Be my little freak (yeah) be my little freak
Let her put her hands in your pants, be my little freak (yeah)
If you're fuckin with me, really fuckin with me
You'll let her put her hands in your pants, be my little freak

[Usher]
Ay girl, I see you like that, you gettin excited
And you're rockin like a pro with it girl
By the way, you got right on it, with the chick you wanted
And now you in the corner kissin on a girl
