[Erykah Badu]
As the wind blows in passing
Baby I think I'm fallin in love with you
Where you go when you gone baby? Whatcha do? 
I know you gotta get your hustle on

[Chorus]
So gone baby, gone baby, don't be looooooong
Gone baby, gone baby, don't be looooooong
Oooh-ooh, gone baby, gone baby, don't be looooooong
Gone baby, gone baby, don't be looooooong

Where you going with your stuff? Baby, what's the rush?
You got me feelin like a girl with a fiendish crush - hey
When you're gone, where you go, boy I miss you much
But I know you got to get your hustle on...

[Chorus @X]

[Bridge 1]
I can't wait, to see what you'll do
It's not too much, to follow you through
Ooh, I can't wait, to see what you'll be
I'm gon' be here, 'cause I believe
So gone, gone baby

There's only one thing I'm still askin..
Why is it I feel you masking?
If this love that you feel is really real
And I know you got to get yo' hustle on
You laugh when you ask, "Baby, what's the rush?" (No-ho, baby)
When we touch, wanna know if it's love or lust, ohh..
Uh, cause I feel like a girl with a feindish crush
And I know you got to get your hustle on

[Chorus]

[Bridge 2]
I can't wait, to see how you move
I like to watch, you do what you do
Ooh, I can't wait to see what you'll be
I'm gon' be here, 'cause I believe
So gone, gone baby

[Chorus and harmonizing 'til fade]</pre>
