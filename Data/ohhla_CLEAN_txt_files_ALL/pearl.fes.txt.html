[Chorus: Fes Taylor]
That Wolf Pack shit
I got a fully load clip, nigga, I stay on that shit
That what, that what, that Wolf Pack shit
I got a fully load clip, nigga, I stay on that shit
That what, that what, that Wolf Pack shit
I got a fully load clip, nigga, I stay on that shit
That what, that what, that Wolf Pack shit

[Fes Taylor]
First nigga pull a slammer out, usually don't die
Try some shit you seen in the movie, the uzi by my side
Go ahead, prove to me you live, knew that he a lie
Nudity manage to me and Mary J. Blige
Front on me or mines, need Medicaid cards
Wolves will spray at your car, nigga better pray to God
We don't got no hammers, right ("Get the fuck out my face with that shit")
Son, I smack a nigga with the pearl handle, right
To his fucking forehead *four gun shots*
And now the nigga's all dead ("Feel better muthafucka?")
Hugging on the block on them corners and aves
Know he got them quarters and halves, you want it in slabs
You get it in bags, 12/12's hard to fit in bags
Use corners, ripping the plastic bags
Out of town shit, front at this rap shit
Fuck all this clown shit, I'm done with this rap shit
Niggas can snap, lean and pop, but if I snapped, then a nina pop
Take a deep breath, then ya breathing stop
Shoot back, even cops, over these bleeding blocks
Crack ain't selling, run up in a reefer spot
I hit the pizza spot, nigga, you a beast or not
I got a plan ready, run up in Manfredi
Tell him how the van's ready, how we expand Feddi
