(Intro)
Snowgoons on the beat
Viro with the speech
Jersey to Germany
Yo...

[Viro the Virus]
Catch me in the corner not speaking
First heard Ghost say it, Lord knows that's how I play it
Cuz most of these bozos will fake it
Hiding hatred behind handshakes and embraces
If you ain't careful may mistake it
For true love and end up backstabbed and snake bit
The whole landscape is tainted
Where niggas' true colors ain't in the picture they painted
Look, can't trust these senioritas either
Think she's your Bonnie till she start telling as quick as Tia
I suggest you just treat 'em fair
Sleeping next to me playing catch with Steve McNair (RIP)
Yeah, these names are batty
Better beware or you can hang with Gatti
See sadly you really get no benefit
From a friendship with Brutus, Judas, or Benedict

(Hook)
Cuz....
Yeah, see there's a limit to the love
Human nature says the hate is in their blood
Keep your friends close, your enemies closer
Y'all might find they're one and the same before it's over

[Viro the Virus]
Gang Starr called it "Betrayal" come to 'Moment of Truth'
Money and lust leave no buddies to trust
The trife life is full of with B.S.
Where enemies be less threats than your B.F.F.'s
Thin line 'tween love and hate
Can't differentiate from your bitter rival and your running mate
When the stakes are high some are just as likely to save your behind
As knife or blade in your spine
They deceive the smiles and high fives
Secretly devise how to lead to your demise
Can leave you assed out to a large extent
When niggas got two faces like Harvey Dent
Don't be rolling with the phony sort
Think he your homie till he hopping out the Trojan Horse
You gotta see through the camouflage
Or get sabotaged by your own entourage

(Hook)
Cuz....
Yeah, see there's a limit to the love
Human nature says the hate is in their blood
Reminiscent the crabs in a bucket
Love is hard to find when backstabbing's abundant

[Viro the Virus]
First heard Nas say it; "Best friends become strangers"
But at that time I ain't relate with it
As I've grown I've seen how true colors get shown
And learned to keep so-called friends at a safe distance
When you up niggas show you love
But turn on you like a German Shepherd over drugs
Long as you got a buzz you can call 'em bud
Hit a slump in the ship
They ready to jump, start slinging mud
I limit expectations
Knowing that many men fall victim to last temptations
Even the most promising relation
Can still be evolved to a hostile separation
I stay in constant preparation
So the day of betrayal is no shocking revelation
Cuz truly you really get no benefit
From a friendship with a Brutus, Judas, or Benedict

(Hook)
Cuz....
Yeah, see there's a limit to the love
Human nature says the hate is in their blood
Game's sick, this is a remedy
With friends like these who really needs any enemies?</pre>
