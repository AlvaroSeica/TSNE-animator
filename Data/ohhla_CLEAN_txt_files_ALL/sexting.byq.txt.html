[Intro]
Yo...
Callin all the girls with the heels
Preferably the ones with the ass
Tell me girl are those titties real?
Sorry but a nigga had to ask; I say ay
Callin all the girls with the heels
Preferably the ones with the ass
No I dont live in The Hills
but a nigga do got swag, hey!

[ScHoolboy Q]
Look into my eyes you can see I'm gone
Girl do you know what type of flow I'm on?
Word around town that I'm still unknown
Huh, how the fuck that sound?
Since I came up all the fucks bow down
But anyway you see this new style I found?
Lookin for a boss so my dick can drown
Put in all in, hit 'em 'til she sounds
What'chu know about Q?
Bitch I brought the motherfuckin gangsters back
Uhh, what'chu know about Q?
Bitch I left the turf and I still be strapped
Still on the scene with a bunch of bitches
Too many on my team need extra benches
One at a time, yeah I fucks 'em senseless
Gimme blowjob, be my apprentice

[Interlude]
Uhh~! You sexy girl, you sexy girl let me rock your world
Get real nasty and lick your pearl
And do the little thing where you make it twirl
Uhh~! You sexy girl, you sexy girl yeah I said it right
Everything in life comes with a price
Now drop it like it's hot and get down tonight

[Chorus]
Me and you (you, uhh) one time for the bitches!!! Hey
Me and you (uhh) bring a friend to be a witness!! Hey
Get them digits textin textin (yeah)
Dog or not you guessin guessin (yeah)
At my crib I'm flexin flexin (yeah)
All night long we sextin sextin (yeah)
I'ma tap that ass, tap that ass {*4X variations*}

[ScHoolboy Q]
Says she never been with a star
And I can tell she never met a G
Now get your pretty ass in the car
And please don't get your pussy on my seats, hey!
Says she never been with a star
And I can tell she never met a G
Bitch do you know who I are?
Ain't a new nigga fuckin with me
If you wanna hang out then you gotta blow trees
If you wanna stay then you gotta bring three
One more thing, yo they gotta all drink
Another heads up, yo they gotta all freak
Twist another wood then we pass it around
Boom to the crib unfasten your gown
Yeah I'm tryin to hit don't flake on me now
I ain't tryin to hear you ain't sexted in a while
Bitch what'chu know about Q?
Bitch I brought the motherfuckin gangsters back
Uhh, what'chu know about Q?
Bitch I left the turf and I still be strapped
Still on the scene with a bunch of bitches
Walkin through the mall and they blow me kisses
Scratchin on my balls, probably caught me limpin
Figaro boy so you know it's pimpin

[Interlude] * and [Chorus]

* last line "Now drop it like it's hot and let me fuck tonight"
