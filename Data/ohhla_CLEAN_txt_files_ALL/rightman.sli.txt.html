Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I've got this feelin' that
I'll put on over
Try to fight and conquer rules
We're non-existent
Tryin' to tell us it's
Over and over again
Cuz I'm the righeous man
Cuz i'm the righteous man
Every day its all the same
Every day its all the same
Every day its all the same
Every day its all the same
Bang bang bang bang he's dead
He took the bullet in the head
While tryin' to escape
He's better off he said
Tryin' not needing
Catch another scene it's
A catch your mother if you can
I'm your righteous man
Every day it's all the same
Every day it's all the same
Every day it's all the same
Every day it's all the same
Yeah yeah the same
All the same
All the same
All the same
All the same
Yeah yeah
It's all the same
Yeah
It's all the same
Yeah
It's all the same
I'm gonna wait wait wait until the morning comes
I'm gonna skat-skiddly skat until ya feel dumb
I feel a million dollars runnin' through my hand
I'm gonna make more money than a dealer man
I say
Put down the badges and throw away your guns
Can't ya see we aint havin' fun no
I'm gonna wait til' the break of dawn
To hear this funky reggae song
Yeah feel the beat rushin' through my veins
People try to tell me
Everything is gonna be
All the same yeah
I say
Every day is gonna be the same
(it's all the same)
Every day is gonna be the same
(it's all the same)
Every day is gonna be all the same
Yeah
It's all the same
Yeah
Every day it's all the same
Every day it's all the same
Every day it's all the same
Every day it's all the same
Yeah yeah the same
All the same, all the same, all the same
All the same, yeah yeah yeah</pre>
