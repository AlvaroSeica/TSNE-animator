All hail to the N9NE!!

You punks thought it was over for me?
I should prevail a institation
All of the high exalted punks
TechN9neee!

Move something
Do something
Scream something
AIGHHHTT
Cruelsome
Gruesome
Hoodlums

I...

V-I-C-T-O-R-Y

[Chorus]
I'm still climbin
Niggaz be rhyming
While they gain lip with me
So you can keep hatin
Now they want me makin
Swimming in Victory

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Yo yo
They thought it was over
But I gots to bust
Call them foes
Stealing flows
That they got from us
What
We coming through your city with lots of lust
Get the dough get ya hoes then we knock them up and cut
Still clowning
Jealousy be frowning
Keep in the street pounding
Haters that be downing
Y'all
Keep houndin
Looking for new sounds
That nina done put down
Well hey baby you found em
We "Victors"
Invested in big Wars
We coming to get yours
We hit till it get sore
We spit
Acrobatical
Never simple schematical
Vivid liquid compatible
Shrooms X's and Aderals
Thought Anghellic wouldn't make it
We take it
Every time we get your girly butt naked
Real melons
Still Heaven
Still Hellen
Still bellin through the city
With them class ain't felons
At that bar with it
The fans know it how we are with it
Carobulou with a Church Hill cigar with it
Don't never far get it
Woman getting targeted
Six hundred cars with it
Tech is coming hard with it

[Chorus 2x]
I'm still climbin
Niggaz be rhyming
While they gain lip with me
So you can keep hating
Now they wanna make it
Swimming in Victory

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
All I wanna see is broads with us
Strange hella odd niggaz
Roll with them hard Hitters
That would mob with us
So god get us
Player haters that squab with us
They bob with us
Cause the Techa-Nina is bizarre lecture
I'm A (WHAT?!)
Party
And a Muhani
And a punani cannibal
Can nobody calm me
The killa Dahni is a Zombie and Ho
Ladies on the dance floor
Let yo homey make you touch your toes
Skip them foes
Strike a pose
Hot as hell
Grab your chicken head by the tail
A lot of tail
Can generate you a lot of mail
I'm the victorious
You the big time
Ya gal took my lizard and licked him
And my twins she kissed 'em (MUAHH)
So tell me how this
Tune sounds
You love it so never tune the
Boom down
You never thought we be some scholars
With shrooms round
Mexican woman
And now we ballers
And poon hounds

[Chorus 2x]
I'm still climbing
Niggaz be rhyming
While they gain lip with me
So you can keep hatin
Now they want me makin
Swimming in Victory

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Haha
Yo
Thats why your mama got a big 'ol butt ( OH YEAH )
And your sister got a big 'ol butt ( OH YEAH )
Says your mama and your sister had a big 'ol butt
To help the nina bust a big 'ol nut ( OH YEAH )
I'm the King (king)
Niggaz that know it
Thats why they want me in the Ring (ring)
Hoping I blow up but I love the cream (cream)
Is what I mean (mean)
No matter what kind of lyrics you like
Tech N9ne fans don't want to hear it tonight
All hail to my jail homies
Cameron, Moberly, Boomville
You can bet we soon will
Bump head
A wise man once said
Everybody want go heaven
But nobody want dead
Numb heads
If they diss the Vette
Break the mother fuckers down if they disrespect
The Tech
This is Victory cause I gets the check
I leave you player haters glistening wet
PUNK BITCH

[Chorus 4x]
I'm still climbin
Niggaz be rhyming
While they gain lip with me
So you can keep hatin
Now they want me makin
Swimming in Victory</pre>
