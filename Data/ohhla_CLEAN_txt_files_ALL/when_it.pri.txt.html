Like I'm bustin', 

[Prime Time]
See my Hounds, we be known for packin' gats and stuff
When a Hound get down, we known for packin' gats and stuff
Ya feelin' me?
 I want mine, and if I don't get mine, 
Then I'm takin' what's yours, I'm comin' through them doors
Takin' what's rightfully yours, 
When it come down to the come down, 
I realize I miss my Father, 
When it come down to the come down
I realize I miss my daughter
When it come down to the Blood Hound
Gotta get this shit in order
When it come down to a She Hound
Gotta go off in that water
When it come down to the come down
We bust up in yo Nautica
When it come down to the come down
Hope'n life don't get no harder
When it come down to the come down
Hope'n life don't be precautions
When it come down to the come down
I hope life don't be departed
When it come down to the come down
Gettin' stupid and retarted
When it come down to the come down
Still gone be pumpin' tha party
When it come down to the come down
Tear down the whole New Orleans

[Chorus]
Ain't to many niggas alive
Be thuggin' like I'm thuggin'
Ain't to many niggas alive
Be bustin' like I'm bustin'
Better get to bustin', 
Don't make have to tear this bitch down, and
Look here don't make me have to call my fuckin' Hounds
[2x]

[C.Y.]
When it came down it went down
Dog shells pro found
When it came down it went down
Club with criminals
When it came down it went down
Bought my Bentley clown
When it came down, it went down
I can swim or drown
When it came down, it went down
Fuck that goes around
When it came down, it went down
Meet at Jackson Bound
When it came down, it went down
Label crazy Hound
When it came down, it went down
Marshall's want me now
When it came down, it went down
Bitch you played me fouled
When it came down, it went down
They want my body found
When it came down, it went down
Houndin' underground
When it came down, it went down
They found up Gert Town
When it came down, it went down
Allah I miss my Mother
When it came down, it went down
And physically my Brother
When it came down, it went down
You gone let me recover?
When it came down, it went down
Don't let me get discovered

[Chorus-2x]

[Zilla]
It's goin' down nigga, I'm leavin' yo head on
I ain't gone chill alone, it's best ya head on
You in clear pressure danger wootay
You play around, like this thang ain't loaded
Well I'm a clown, act a ass if I gotta
I told 'em I'm a Hustler, but they didn't know that I was a Rider
Look, come on, it's gettin' out round here, 
Them South Coasts Boys, gone lay ya down right here
So tell them Lil' Boys, don't come around this year
A lot of them Lil' Boys, ain't gone be found this year
Whoa huh, I heard ya rattin'
But we ain't fuckin' round no more, 
You in a league of yo own
We don't fuck around no more
My click and cheese eaters
Don't trust ya, don't need ya
It's goin' down nigga, where I stand, is where Im'a leave ya
My click and cheese eaters, don't trust ya don't need ya
When it come down to the come down
Where I stand, I'ma leave ya nigga

[Chorus]</pre>
