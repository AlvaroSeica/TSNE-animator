Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Uhh, day in our life
Wake up to what we didn't smoke last night
Got right, got high
I got hibachi left overs, little steak fried rice
I got fresh and select what to drive up
Swear it's like GTA 5 out
Swear it's like NBA live
Weather type, gorgeous outside
Ferrari horses, galloping from the fortress
Now when you rollin, women notice and some approach us
Some of them hoes and shit, some of them worse, then some of them sorcerers
But nobody's perfect
H Town, South swinging, shawty think I'm drunk swerving
Naw love, I'm driving like this on purpose
On just banging with my jernt lit
Now she rollin with a boss cause she deserve it

I seen this badass bitch in some hi top whites
I seen this badass bitch in some hi top whites
Then I met a badass bitch in some hi top whites
Now I got a badass bitch in some hi top whites

I'm a motherfucking race car
Nigga, you the motherfucking bate car
Don't even be on bad bitches radar
Jet life, we in the house like base boards
This kush I had to fly to LA for
This wax I had to fly to the bay for
Bad bitch that I wish I could've stayed for
But that ain't what a nigga get paid for
That's how it is, wish that I could say more
Don't be like that, girl keep it playa
You know a nigga grind on major
But I be back, keep your hair the same way girl
I put the story on paper and the weed in the air
Pretty cars, pretty bitches, I done had my share
But I'd hate to tell y'all the one
Bout the one, that I met in New Orleans

I seen the badass bitch in some hi top
I seen this badass bitch in some hi top whites
I met a badass bitch in some hi top whites
Now I got a badass bitch in some hi top whites</pre>
