[Intro]
In a world of mischief, we fiend for glory
The true satisfaction held within mankind lies in BLOOD!

[Hopsin]
You don't wanna get ya head cracked?
When you see me comin through you better step back
I be crumplin on you niggaz leavin you stuck up in the gutter
with ya neck and your body ready to share that (blood)
I'm a beast in the night
Creepin up on you to feast on your life
The demons inside
Are tellin me to give you a reason to cry
And leave you to lie in (blood)

[Chorus]
Now see, I got a strange urge
And I feel like creepin up on a stranger
I want your blood
Blood {*4X*}
I want your blood
Blood {*4X*}
Give me your blood

[Hopsin]
You don't really wanna roam in the darkness (no)
You ain't ready for the pain and the harshness (no)
I'm zonin up to hop outside of my ride, at full speed, then swerve till the car flips (blood)
You dealin with a maniac
See I know a couple of ways to scrap
I'mma raise the axe
Throw it at you while you're runnin away and when it hits, your brains will splat
So just face the facts
I'm a result of all the gangsta rap
I say shit, never take it back
I don't hate to brag
A true menace with a love of blood
You'll never get rid of my ways
Whatchu think of that, huh? (blood)

[Chorus]

[Hopsin]
Beat niggaz till they have concussions (woah)
Rape wives and then laugh at husbands (woah)
And if you down with the mass destruction (what)
Toast to it with a glass of blood then (blood)
Pray to God for a night to start
I'm a psycho nigga finna top the charts
Bein shot with darts till it stops your heart
And chopped apart and thrown up in a shoppin cart
And pushed off a cliff, there's no alternate
Endin that involved with this, it's your fault I'm pissed
You're gonna suffer the consequences
You can not prevent this shit, I promise it, come on (blood)
Pretty clear that my brain's not there
I be lookin for it when I shave my hair
Black is the color that I paint my lair
And the way I break niggaz everyday is not fair
It's all because of the rage I bare
See I'm down for whatever, just say "I dare"
My nutsac is the biggest
so you niggaz gonna have to murder me if you wanna take my pair (blood)

[Chorus]

[Hopsin]
You don't like me? Tune it out
I'm livin life on the foolish route
When I hit the kitchen, I butcher you niggaz
into that drain slowly, but only when the moon is out
I get this way when my mood is down
Some even think that I'm rude and foul
Out of all the lovely children my mother gave birth to, I was the stupid child (blood)
Back in the day, when I was in elementary, I would chisel a pencil until it sharp as fuck
Leavin the bullies laid out, on the playground
When they came round, yell "fuck" if you're raw as nuts, come on (fuck)
The sound of blood is so marvelous, stab a nigga in his stomach till you scar the gut
Hit 'em in the spine until you paralyze him
and fill him with lighter fluid and go ahead and spark him up
And then abracadabra, am I missin brain cells? That doesn't matter
Makin you scream makes me a happier rapper
You don't want trouble then your ass better back up
Fast little bastard (blood)
I was born as a natural hazard, I turn lives into massive disasters
Look over your shoulder when I'm in your area
You might get hit in the cranium with the back of a hammer (blood)

[Chorus]</pre>
