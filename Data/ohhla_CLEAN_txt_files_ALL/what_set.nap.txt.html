[Napoleon]
In Virginia we flip O's, bricks keep our wrists froze
Drug dealers push Benz Coupes, instead of 6-4's
Half of these chicks hoes, they giving strip shows
Just for me to get dough, I kidnap a rich foe
Thug niggas sniff blow, shit, Michael Figno
All about the way we kill niggas, if they snitch, yo
Calico's we spit slow, feds taking pics yo
Club lights, we get so drunk, niggas we piss Mo'
Dubs on our whips glow, aiyo, we stick those
White boys that sell E pills inside the disco
VA cats sick, yo, master rubber grips blow
We got it all from Latin King folks, Bloods, Crips, show

[Chorus]

[Napoleon]
Yo, it's the same shit, different day, vice law, sniffing yay
Trick bitches still tricking, old folks sit and pray
Young kids that once had, dreams of the NBA
Locked up with fifty years, sitting up in prison gate
Red flags, blue flags, chinchillas, doo-rags
Purple haze in caskets, diesel in the blue bags
Gang bang in Park Place, I spit in a NARC's face
Every time endictments come around, yo, my heart race
OG's, OZ's, my powder cause nose bleeds
Plus we put embalming fluid, all over my foes reef
Blood in, blood out, you fight if you fight me
All of my niggas caught, bodies in they white tees
We break thumbs and tattoo tears like Bobby Johnson
Riding through the hood in Maserati with a Thompson
When money short, my goons beat, fiends with the hammers
Illuminati goons, we wearing green bandanas

[Chorus]

[Napoleon]
My Crenshaw, to Gary, Indiana, yo my name ring
We similar to Gremlins, the feds call us gangreen
Chuck Taylors, catch me out west with the esses
With SK's, beige khaki's, quick to let the techs spray
Decepticon, my man, Jim Jones, a fifty state rebel
He lock and load, with the thirty eight special
We throw signs to join us, you got the killa po' nine
Niggas weed so garbage, shit, I'd rather grow mine
Sherm stick, code of the street, you better learn quick
Before I come to your crib, on some Big Perm shit
So play Smokey, and don't deal with principality
I stab you in your neck with a pencil, yeah, it's a casualty
We game related, but not a movie like 2Pac's
Cuz only real for real, my niggas cop new glocks
From King's Nation, I'm so hot, you sware you seen Satan
I know Bloods with red shoe strings for laces

[Chorus]</pre>
