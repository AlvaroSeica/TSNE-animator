"I invest indigenous interest"  (2Mex sample scratched by dj ESP)

[2Mex]
I am the Keeper of the Keys
The poise in the trees
The salt in the seas
The degrees when you freeze
The origin of disease
The power to bring the entire planet down to it's knees
Dropping love bombs on hyperextended palms
Superimposed songs reword written wrongs
Petition repetition and redundant incumbent
The witness will witness the abundance of oneness
The ability to scream until I faint
I'm dodging the dreams, I take my fate
Looking for the long lifeline of a line
And I'm being forced to fingerprint all the fineprint
Now I'm implicated in triplicate
I'm a complicated instrument
Playing an isolated incident
With self-sedated insolence
Southern California significance

[Chorus:  sampled singing]
"Keeper of the Keys
He's the Keeper of the Keys
It's all so __?__"

[2Mex]
Still the Keeper of the Keys
I can't trust any emcees
Until all of my conspiracy theories are at ease
I will wear a gasmask in the breeze
Protect originality from planetary thieves
Medical science is insanity
Every computer in the world is mad at me
'Cause I'm not compatible
To a nonspiritual sabbatical
And as my saneness descends
And I realize that I don't need any more friends
When time goes back to where it's from
My skin will shed into an indigenous drum
Songodsuns, the reception is trinitron
The motivation to get up and live on
Minimalizing all the daily mistakes
Subliminally despising all the fakes
That's why I'm RUNNING... until the end of the night
I'm LONGING... for my words to be the light
I'm DREAMING... that we will all be alright
I'm RUNNING LONG DREAMS until I ignite

So just reach, ha, come on, just a little
I put this on everything in the world that it'll
Be the beginning of what is to be endless
'Cause loving you is infinite and effortless

Reach, ha, come on, just a little
I put this on everything in the world that it'll
Be the beginning of what is to be endless
'Cause loving you is infinite and effortless

[Chorus:  sampled singing]
"Keeper of the Keys
He's the Keeper of the Keys"

"It's all so __?__"</pre>
