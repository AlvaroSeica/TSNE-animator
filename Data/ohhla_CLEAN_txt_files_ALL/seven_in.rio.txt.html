They say "Money Is The Reason" everybody bleeding
but help in this ghetto is what my people needing
the whole world is against my face
that's why I gotta kick a rhyme for the sake of my race
You gotta know that we running out of time it's a very long line
up in heaven so I'm trying to kick a triple seven
cause "Triple Six be the Cause of Death"
that's why we slanging in the hood getting all what's left
it ain't good from the very very start everybody had a heart
on the ship gave trust now we all apart
we try to spark but yet another we thug
we got "Blacks Killing Blacks" for the brotherly love
it's all under the rug if you open your eyes
then maybe you can find the truth, so together we die
I can't lie, I really wanna save what's left
But when you living in this hell your only raised for death

[2X]
Is their a Seven In the Sea
And if it is, will I live to see my kids
I'm doing bids
Cause living Life in the ghetto is wrong
So I'm trying to give it all through the yell of a song
I moan---

Looking in my brain while erasing my pain
remain childhood memories I reminisce them was G's
Growing up I wanted to feel that taste
that was before my best friend, "Was killed in my face"
what a waste to a nation that was slaved for years
instead of trying to come together we rather grave our peers
and leave tears on a face of a mother who's mourn
"How could you do a such thing to your brother that's born" ?
another cover we torn off a page that really meant
alot to this age my whole nation stay a rage
and it's displayed you think you did what's real
but you didn't realize all the kids you killed
will affect every man every woman in time
but then again it's not a crime but my brother is blind
forever I shine for you to feel what's true
"But then again you never know they may kill me 2"

Is their a Seven in the Sea

It wouldn't even matter if I made it big
But then I gotta let you know about the grave you dig
is getting beast, I'm loosing all my nigga's in the streets
while the president steady fucking ass with the grease
if getting cash was a piece of the plan for us
then how the fuck he get the right to demand our trust
I'm just waiting "America the land of the Satan"
everybody hypnotized about the money they be making
no mistaking, Rio really name his tools
all you nigga's making money in this game is fools
u think you getting paid with the riches and flows
"Disrespecting black Women" call them bitches and hoes
talking about how you made it with the drugs you slung
like I really give a fuck you make a thug look dumb
"We used to get Hung" won't you think about that
they let the "Monkey out the Cage" and we don't know
how to act

Is their a Seven in the Sea ????

That nigga Rio when you living in the C
Hey It ain't ain't easy growing up to be
When everyone you see is going six feet deep
Hey It ain't easy can't a nigga tell
So many black men is either dead or in jail
Can you tell it ain't easy
Can you tell it ain't easy to be the Reeee'

That's why you gotta ball every chance you get
and when you think you got it all you must advance yo shit
cause shit niggaz get jealous
your thinking their your fellas
they plotting on your ass with the wooden sweat-us
They wouldn't let us come together
Like back in the days before the crack and the crave
And all the gats that den sprayed
Is it late now I gotta a whole black race
running streets with the hate now is this the fate now
even with a sound we don't listen to this
the only time they come around is when I glisten my wrist
I'm on a mission to list every friend that I had
that was all on my shit back when I was doing bad
that's sad but I gotta stay motivated
They steady wanna please me now that I made it
Shit It ain't easy just look at my skin
Being that nigga Rio without family or friends
It ain't easy-

[2X]
It ain't easy growing up to be
That nigga Rio when you living in the C
Hey It ain't ain't easy growing up to be
When everyone you see is going six feet deep
Hey It ain't easy can't a nigga tell
So many black men is either dead or in jail
Can you tell it ain't easy
Can you tell it ain't easy to be Rio
