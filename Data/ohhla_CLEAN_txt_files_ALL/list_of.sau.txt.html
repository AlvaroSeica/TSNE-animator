[Saul Williams]
I want my money back
I'm down here drowning in your fat
You got me on my knees praying for everything you lack
I ain't afraid of you
I'm just a victim of your fears
You cower in your tower praying that I'll disappear
I got another plan, one that requires me to stand
On the stage or in the street, don't need no microphone or beat
And when you hear this song, if you ain't dead then sing along
Bang and strum to these here drums 'till you get where you belong

[Chorus: Saul Williams]
I got a list of demands, written on the palm of my hands
I ball my fist and you're gonna know where I stand
We're living hand to mouth! You wanna be somebody?
See somebody? Try and free somebody?
I gotta list of demands written on the palm of my hands
I ball my fist and you're gonna know where I stand
We're living hand to mouth!
Hand to mouth!

[Saul Williams]
I wrote a song for you today while I was sitting in my room
I jumped up on my bed today and played it on a broom
I didn't think that it would be a song that you would hear
but when I played it in my head, I made you reappear
I wrote a video for it, and I acted out each part
And then I took your picture out and taped it to my heart
I've taped you to my heart, dear girl, I've taped you to my
heart and if you pull away from me you'll tear my life apart

[Chorus: Saul Williams]
I got a list of demands, written on the palm of my hands
I ball my fist and you're gonna know where I stand
We're living hand to mouth! You wanna be somebody?
See somebody? Try and free somebody?
I gotta list of demands written on the palm of my hands
I ball my fist and you're gonna know where I stand
We're living hand to mouth!
Hand to mouth!

[Saul Williams]
Ecstasy, suffering, Echinacea, buffering
We aim to remember what we choose to forget
God's just a baby, and her diaper is wet
Call the police!
I'm strapped to the teeth, and liable to disregard your every belief
Call on the law!
I'm fixin' to draw a line between what is and seems and call up a brawl
Call'em now! Cause it's about to go pow!
I'm standing on the threshold of the ups and the downs
Call up a truce!
Cause I'm about to break loose
Protect ya neck, cause, son, I'm breaking out of my noose

[Chorus: Saul Williams] (Repeat 2x)
I got a list of demands, written on the palm of my hands
I ball my fist and you're gonna know where I stand
We're living hand to mouth! You wanna be somebody?
See somebody? Try and free somebody?
I gotta list of demands written on the palm of my hands
I ball my fist and you're gonna know where I stand
We're living hand to mouth!
Hand to mouth!</pre>
