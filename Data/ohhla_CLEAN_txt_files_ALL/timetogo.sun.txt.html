Once upon a time I met a girl at a club
How was I to know I would be runnin into love?
It was strange, the way we met
I said, "What up my name is Sun and this is MoÃ«t"
The way you approached me I knew you were drunk
I tried to hug you, you flaked the funk
Right then I knew just what to expect
Recognizin a challenge I had to accept
No challenge is a challenge or a challenge to me
Took nothin at all but l-o-v-e
Which we both know is too much for you
To even understand the love is true
How hard could it be to wanna do things right
Not smokin, drinkin or hangin out late night
You're not perfect, and this I know
But it hurts me to tell you it's time to go

(Don't go)
(Don't go)

(Please don't leave me)

(Don't go)
(Don't go)

(Please don't leave)

I never met any girl who was so unique
Behind closed doors, boy, what a freak
That's not the problem I hate to say
I know you're up to no good, but that's okay
I know I flirt like it doesn't hurt
But I'd never set foot into another girl's skirt
Honesty is the best policy
I never lied to you, so why lie to me?
For no reason at all, do you think I'd fall
I can't tell if you're hurt or havin a ball
You do what you wanna do without my say so
And that's how I know that it's time to go

(Don't go)
(Don't go)

(Please don't leave me)

(Don't go)
(Don't go)

(Please don't leave)

Breakin up, makin up, why pretend with you?
Even went as far as to come move in with you
Still you had to have more attention
Startin to argue and not to mention
Fightin in the clubs and on the dancefloor
All through the street on up to the front door
Friends, neighbors become spectators
Watchin you and I fight in the elevator
A couple of bruises to show my part
Of a used and abused and a bruised up heart
Put the blame on me and say that I'm wrong
Send me away and cry when I'm gone
Your friends influence you to go to the party
No wonder your girlfriends don't have anybody
All they wanna do is run your life
Turn run into ruin plans for bein my wife
No engagement, keep the ring
I'm not infatuated by material things
Although I'm hurt real bad I want you to know
That the clock in my heart says it's time to go

(Don't go)
(Don't go)

(Please don't leave me)

(Don't go)
(Don't go)

(Please don't leave)

Are those hickeys on your neck? Don't try to hide
I gave you a chance to tell the truth and you lied
I may go to jail for aggravated assault
Go ahead and say it, it's all my fault
You have nothin to offer me, we know that's true
I'm only here because I'm in love with you
And of course there's a child involved that I care for
But she may never ever see me anymore
I've done my best but you are like the rest
Too blind to see true happiness
Go back to bein dissed, a late night mistress
I'm leavin you with my behind to kiss
Take your alcohol breath, your cigarette breath
A memory of Sun is all that's left
And you can think about me when you see the video
Adios amigos, it's time to go

(Don't go)
(Don't go)

(Please don't leave me)

(Don't go)
(Don't go)

(Please don't leave)

I want you to understand I have to do this
You really let me down
Quit a nice job to get back on welfare
Sleep all day and hang out all night
How you livin?
You're too lazy, too insecure, too selfish
Furthermore I gotta go

(Don't go)</pre>
