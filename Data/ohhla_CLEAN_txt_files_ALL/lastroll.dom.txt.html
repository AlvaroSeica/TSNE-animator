[Bob Marley]
Herb... herb is a PLANT
I mean, herbs are good for everyt'ing
Why, why deez people want to do so much good
for everyone, who call themselves governments
and this and that?
Why dem say you must not use the herb?
You see? What dem say, dem just say
"No you musn't use it, you musn't use it because
 it make you rebel" ... against what?
Against men who wan crave because dem crave
for the t'ings actually
Dem have, some material t'ings
and dem wanna captivate your mind until you say
"Well you have to work, and put in pension
 and then keep it all" ... so herb make you look
'pon yourself and, instead of you wan' work for the man
You want, you want, you want fi
You want fi every one of the man to
Not in the sense of "oh it is" but in the sense of
why should you have to bow to these things?
That means you're your own man
and you're first and your own yourself!
You do what you want to do
Anything people want to say about it they ain't over here
Well I've been a rasta from ever since, you know
But, it's not all that I've been a rasta, it's
All line thinkin to grow
Cause what is is what is
From beginning to the end, you can never change
So let us rasta from creation

So herb make you look
'pon yourself and, instead of you wan' work for the man
You want, you want, you want fi
You want fi every one of the man to
Not in the sense of "oh it is" but in the sense of
why should you have to bow to these things?
That means you're your own man
and you're first and your own yourself!
You do what you want to do
Anything people want to say about it they ain't over here
Cause what is is what is

Yo, even though I can't see from the position which I'm standin
We gon' make it to the top and we gon' fuckin crash land it
See it in my dreams, I just finally understand it
I am livin this shit out exactly how my visions planned it
No time for that dormant shit, naw I'm high flyin
We gon' get on this shit or we gon' die tryin
But I got a lotta livin left, so I'm high grindin
My shades on through the night cause I can see my light shinin
What up though? Especially to the ones that really hate it
Shout out to the bitches comin 'round once we make it
I'm glad I could be around to see you up at your fakest
Assures me on what side of this shit I need to keep my placement
I'll never let you niggaz get my soul
My heart is just another story that's never been told
This ain't no Drake shit, and that crying's gettin old
I realized my faith, my decisions are getting bold
And love is time consumin, so these bitches get me cold
I apologize for the wait, now let them papers roll
Or maybe that's just me, submerged behind the smoke
Promised momma I'll do it, so fuck it, here it go
Make all these blogs and critics feel the young nigga flow
The floor plan left on the ground is where I drew it
I guess these the same grounds where I had to prove it
The shit I stress so much about, told you I'd do it
Yeah, Domo Genesis
And this was "Rolling Papers"
Hope y'all enjoyed me on my first one
Many more to come
Odd Future, Wolf Gang
Salute me gang
Yeah~!
Peace, that was cheesy as fuck, I said peace
Alright, bye motherfuckers</pre>
