[Verse]
No chance, that's what you got..
You up against a machine too strong
Pretty politicians buyin souls for our song
PUPPETS!  Will find their place in line
But tie a string around your finger now boy
Cause it's, it's just a matter of time

[Chorus]
Cause you've got - NO CHANCE!
NO CHANCE IN HELL!
You've got - NO CHANCE!
NO CHANCE IN HELL!
You've got - NO CHANCE!
NO CHANCE IN HELL!
You've got - NO CHANCE!
NO CHANCE IN HELL!

[Breakdown]
C'mon, c'mon, come and get it
C'mon..
C'mon, c'mon, come and get it
C'mon..
C'mon, c'mon, come and get it
C'mon..
C'mon, c'mon, come and get it
No chance..

[Chorus]
NO CHANCE!
NO CHANCE IN HELL!
You've got - NO CHANCE!
NO CHANCE IN HELL!
You've got - NO CHANCE!
NO CHANCE IN HELL!
You've got - NO CHANCE!
NO CHANCE IN HELL!
