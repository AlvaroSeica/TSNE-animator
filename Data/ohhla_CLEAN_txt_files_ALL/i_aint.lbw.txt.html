Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
I see you lookin at me exactly like you know wat it do
When I leave where I'm at. make my way over to you
Cause I ain't playin with you girl (just want you to know) I ain't playin
If I whisper in your ear wats goin thru in my in my head baby
I bet you turn around ntell me baby let's le-eave

Any girl JD used to bring around I had a crush on
Wishin I cud take em to my room and get my touch on
If you was jus a lil older is wat dey used to say
Kissin me huggin callin me baby how dey use to play
But now that I am tewnty-one if you go to kissin n huggin me
Lil mami I'm trying to cop sumtin, I'm in da club now tearin up
Tank top, standin on da couch screamin "who bet I can't stop"
Album number 7 started at 11 steady yungest nigga killin it
Shawty you better tell em uh, used to be your lil sister dat I was concerned about
Now I want you I see you lookin now I'm a thug it out
Don't slip look again girl if you do I'm goin in
tell em lil mama wat you waitin for I just want you to know
I ain't playin I ain't playin girl you already kno

[Chorus]
I see you lookin at me exactly like you know wat it do
When I leave wher I'm at. make my way over to you
Cause I ain't playin with you girl (just want you to know) I ain't playin
If I whisper in your ear wats goin thru into my head baby
I bet you turn around n tell me baby let's le-eave

If you a fly young chick I'm a fly young nigga
Plenty dudes make fake us but nobody got a swag like mine
Feelin horny girl I kno you want me girl
I'm bout to tell you wat I'm thinking baby close your eyes
I'm right here baby I'm in your ear baby
Let's make a movie need to get that ass in here baby
I like to drink a lot let's take it to my spot
Soon as we hit the doooor were guna drink some more
And I'm a kiss you here and I'm a kiss you der and I'm a kiss ya, kiss ya, kiss ya
Kiss ya everywhere (bow wow) said I'm a kiss you der and I'm a kiss ya, kiss ya, kiss ya
Kiss ya everywhere

[Chorus]
I see you lookin at me. exactly like you know wat it do
When I leave wher I'm at make my way over to you
Cause I ain't playin with you girl (I just want you to know) I ain't playin
If I whisper in your ear wats goin thru in my in my head baby
I bet you turn around n say baby let's le-eave

They say rockstars live da life, but I beg to differ
Tommy lee and nikki sumtin ain't got shit on this nigga
From some playboy bunnies girls with deyre own money
Got em so backed up in my sidekick it ain't funny
Got em high enough in parties sometimes keep da red carpet
Cause I don't know how to stop it. once I get it started
I go hard go hard when I'm in da paint quick
to let you know I'm errthing dat your nigga ain't
If he ain't got a mil ticket a mansion
and a condo fleet full of cars den you need to let your man go.
This ain't bout da money baby dis about a good time
and I ain't trying to replace your man I'm just talking bout this one time
And your mind saying no but your body saying yes
how you droppin in dat dress and your eyes tell the rest
So don't slip (jecho) look again (jecho) girl if you do I'm goin in</pre>
