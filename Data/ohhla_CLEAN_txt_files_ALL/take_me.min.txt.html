[Verse 1]
They say we are different, what's that common ground?
One day everybody go lay in that ground (yap)
If death is certain, then how you living?
And if heaven's real, tell me how you get in
I'm a bet it on my life, it ain't gonna be about works
So I bet it all on Christ, boy let me give you this work
Way before the moment I crawl I already been in that hurts
I'm already dead, I'm living in reverse
The first will be last and the last will be first
Following Jesus don't mean that there won't be pain
But um, it does promise that none of it is in vain
And um, I'm not afraid of that persecution that came
I'm more afraid of the fame and people knowing my name

[Chorus]
Take me alive, take me alive
Take me alive while I'm still here
Take me alive, take me alive
Take me alive, take me while I'm still here

Take me alive, take me alive
Take me alive, take me while I'm still here
Take me alive, take me alive
Take me alive, take me while I'm still here

[Verse 2]
Keep riding low key, ya'll know me
Soli deo glory be
To the Father I can't lie though sometimes I want it all for me
Urgh, gotta kill that, gotta kill it
Don't conceal that but reveal it
But I don't care what you think about me
The Father know it all and I'm still forgiven
I must decrease cause the way up is down
And His kingdom is our blood, as crazy as that can sound
That's why blood is rushing through my hand
Dying's how I live
If you love your life you lose it
If you lose it, then you'll it gain it and
Wisdom is justified by all the children
God's worthy of my worship, so I'm defying my feelings
In my mess there's a message
In my text, testimony
He say no, I get to know him, when I'm on that rock
Use your brodie!
I cannot be more stocky do, love me some shoes should've copped me two
But I'm thinking about the boxes inside my room
And I'm thinking about the kids that ain't got no food
Uh, that one hurt, the truth is a mother
The father of lies when they come up
Heavy when they run up, the dark will reveal when the sun up
Every day we're dying

[Chorus]
Take me alive, take me alive
Take me alive while I'm still here
Take me alive, take me alive
Take me alive, take me while I'm still here

Take me alive, take me alive
Take me alive, take me while I'm still here
Take me alive, take me alive
Take me alive, take me while I'm still here</pre>
