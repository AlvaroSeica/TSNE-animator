[Chorus 1X - Oozeela]         
Raise your hands in the air
If you feel me pon this one (this one, this one)
Rude bwoy we walk with no fear
Bun Babylon System (system, system)
 
[Dirt Gritie]   
Pour out a little liquor that is if you remember the songs 
About thugs in their heyday who dead and gone
Their lyrics tried to warn us but the message was lost 
Cause all I see is young thugs really tryn'a get on 
Mamma don't let your boy grow up to be a gangster 
Show him some love the whole world it ain't against him
Or you could read it in the head line news 
The drama, the e-street blues 
I tell it straight I ain't tryn'a be shrewd 
We keep living like this we gone lose
Kids skipping school drugs being abused 
Where you think they get it from dog me and you
I got a vision lets change our views 
See patience and compassions what we need to us
Then we could all thrive as a community  
U-N-I-T-Y that a unity
 
[Chorus 1X - Oozeela]         
Raise your hands in the air
If you feel me pon this one (this one, this one)
Rude bwoy we walk with no fear
Bun Babylon System (system, system)
 
[Bigga Nolte]            
Mi done fret in jail await bail 
And if I get free I'm a let my boat sail
The streets trying to take my crown trying to break my sound 
I do my best just to hold it down
They label me a criminal they got no case
But that's how it is when 5-0's on the chase
G-Unit in the place I ain't talking bout 50
I'm talking bout police watching niggas in Bentleys
West division they say they know me
They go around putting taps on me and my homies 
They say the guns I'm blasting to protect my rations
But I gotta pack clips you can call me old fashion
And you think that's how I wanna live 
I got to make moves man that's how it is 
No matter what you do to try to stay true 
Someone's always gonna to hate on you and that's true
 
[Chorus 1X - Oozeela]         
Raise your hands in the air
If you feel me pon this one (this one, this one)
Rude bwoy we walk with no fear
Bun Babylon System (system, system)
 
[Arlo Maverick]                    
What goes around comes around so don't be surprised with 
This economic peril that they call a crisis
Global means Africans not just Anglo-Saxons
Cause where were you when they needed some action
Now watch how they promise thee impossible
Then exploit the third world to make it optional 
Cause the poor have been suffering for how many years
Where was their bailout? How come nobody cared?
But as I speak for the have-nots, will the have-mores
Fear for their cash and wanna grab more
You speak of justice, I speak for just us
Two job having, asking if you want some mustard
I'm tryn'ta muster the strength I need
In a system that preys till you bend your knees
To be meek, I inherit the earth
To not speak, my soul is hurt, so my soul is perched
 
[Chorus 2X - Oozeela]         
Raise your hands in the air
If you feel me pon this one (this one, this one)
Rude bwoy we walk with no fear
Bun Babylon System (system, system)</pre>
