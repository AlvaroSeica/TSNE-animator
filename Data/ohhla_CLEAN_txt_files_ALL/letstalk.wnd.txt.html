Scotland whats happening?
Fucking hell
Jay-Era with the beat
Whats your plan (uh) You ken who it is

[Deeko] 
Sons of Scotland

[Werd]
Let me tell you what its been like
What it still is ok

At sixteen a was one sick teen
Writing sixteen's and scheming on getting green
Screaming to get seen and feeling that that dream
Was one step away but its not what it seems
Trainers still spilt at the seams 
Rips in my jeans
Joggys got hotties a could speak for the scene
Not in rap magazines just heard in Magdeline
Where we get hash and laugh at smack fiends
They had dreams
Now they got nain
Goes with the phrase they're dying in vain
Am no one of them just trying to see change
Trying to fuck fame and blow like getting brain
So a can rock a chain when I walk with a cain
Be the illest old fougie in the old folks home
The sickest schizophrenic (he's a little insane)
Brain rot bad heart ever since a little wain
And after a write this develop arthritis
Blood can flow in ma veins in feels the tightness
Write this so righteous bring the ruckus like Chris
Trying to help the scene but it seems so lifeless

[Werd]
Let's talk about life (life)
Get a job get a flat get a wife
Settle down have kids live right
I write cause that's shite

Let's talk about rap (rap)
Get a mic get a job doing that
Have kids pointing at the map
Like 'there's Scotland there that's where its at

[Deeko]
Dont live for the fame
I was known for the name
Rips in my shirt no stones in my chain
Cant get a job and I know its a shame
That a dont give a shit and iv no one to blame 
But myself
So I think that this hell that a live in
Has got me to the point like there must be a heaven
Gotta find the answers gotta get the questions
Across to the world think IV lost my religion
But I never had it to begin with
I'm not religious
Dont go to church but I celebrate Christmas
Is it wrong to practice
A dont pray to God till something wrong happens
Now am in a situation
When I can either fold and waste it or hope to make it
My poker face is what shows my aches its
A hard knock life just to quote my favorites

[Werd]
Let's talk about life (life)

[Werd]
Im not impressed a think raps a mess man
Shits sloppy like a write with my left hand
Aint a wedding but you ken who the best man
Need to keep it up or you listen to the next man
Cause these rappers all talk about fame
Underground rappers all they do is complain
Im one of them but am no quite the same
Never quitting the game never quiet or tame
A flow deadly like the tracks on a run away train
Hit stations take off
Like a stripper or plane
Yeah a feel the base so am speeding again
So me n Deek take over like the outside lane
So cameras flash when we pass by them
Not right now cause fame iv got nain
Just got a name and lifes so plain
For the record need a record in a frame
(Go plat)

Alright get a job get a wife
