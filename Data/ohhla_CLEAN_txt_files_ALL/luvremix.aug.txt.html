[Intro: August Alsina] + (Trey Songz)
Ay (ohh) ay (ohh)
Ay (ohh) uh-huh (whoa-ohh)
Ay (ohh) ay (ohh)
Ay (whoa-ohh) uh-huh (whoa-ohhhhh-ohhh)
Man I luv this shit {*8X*}

[August Alsina]
A nigga back with this motherfuckin' remix (remix), and we about to kill this shit
See I went and got a little help to get the whole club poppin' like Freaknik
Cause I got Rozay, a little Bombay, a little peach Ciroc and we faded
Soon as we step in, we got your chick, and yo' chick, and yo' chick and I know you hate it
Cause we linin' up the shots, youngin' got the heat to make 'em pop
Soon as we hit the parking lot, then we see all the panties drop
Girl, ain't no bitch nigga, no rich nigga, no snitch nigga
Yo' bitch choosin' on a real nigga, let her chill nigga
That's real, cause I'm so fucked up, now I'm talkin' my shit
I'm way to high to be trippin' like this
Niggas hatin' hard, bitches all on my dick
This is what you want, I'mma put it like this; lay it down to the Aug, Trey and Chris remix

[Chorus: August Alsina]
Say you luv it (ay), you luv it girl (ay)
You luv it (ay), you luv it girl (uh-huh)
You luv it (ay), say you luv it girl (ay)
You luv it (ay), better make you luv it girl (uh-huh)
The way I fuck her, you would think I luv this bitch
I tell her keep on suckin' girl get all this dick
And I'mma keep grindin' nigga try'na get rich
She tell me keep fuckin' cause she luv this shit

[Trey Songz]
Goddamnit, I love it...
She said she just got her some titties (she said she just got her some titties)
Can't wait 'til I come to her city (can't wait 'til I come to her city)
I smoke 'til I choke and I'm dizzy
The liquors invadin' my kidneys; been chillin' and I feel like killin' you niggas
Bitches been missin' me lately (ohh), they love it when I talk to 'em crazy (ohh)
Suck a nigga dick, do it with alot of spit, let it drip, yeah catch my babies
Ohhh-whoooa, that's my baby
Just do it like you care, girl don't worry bout' your- 
hair's fuck up cause I'm pullin' it like this
Your man's fucked up, he don't do you like this
Feels so good that a nigga might kiss
If you ask her she gon' tell you like this

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
Goddamnit she loves it (she loves it), she loves it (she loves it)
She loves it (she loves it), she loves it
Goddamnit she loves it (oooh), she loves it
She loves it, she loves it
So I'mma keep on fuckin' like I luv this bitch (ohh)
I'mma keep her bussin' cause she luv this dick (whoa-ohh)
I'mma keep stuntin' cause I luv bein' rich (ohh)
I'mma keep doin', and I does this shit; Goddamnit, I luv it

[Chris Brown]
She said make love, just make love, just make love to me
Right now (just do it), and she want to try some new shit (just do it)
She said when I kiss it, go and sing to her (how?)
Like this: la-la la-la la, la-la la-la la
Don't, need, full conversation
All we doin' is lickin' and fuckin' and touchin' your booty be speakin' another language 
Ohh yeeeah, this real life to his fake shit
Bottles in the air, I'm faded.. drinkin'
I'm so fucked up now I'm talkin' my shit
I'm so bossed up I be talkin' like Rich
Niggas they know, bitches all on my dick
Baby when we play, put this song on replay, she like "Ooh, that's my shit"

[Chorus: Chris Brown] + {August Alsina}
And I luv it (ay), I luv it (ay)
I luv it (ay), Iiiii
God damn it I luv you baby (ay), I luv it (ay)
I luv it (ay), Iiiii
I'm gon' luv her better cause her man ain't shit
And I'mma keep on strokin' cause she luv this dick
And I'mma keep on lickin' cause she luv it
She tell me keep fuckin cause she luv this shit {and I luv it}</pre>
