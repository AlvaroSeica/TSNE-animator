Typed by: Toby

[Chorus] 
days, days go by 
and life goes on 
life goes on 
it's just a moment of time 
and life goes on 
life goes on 

[Toby]
I woke up late feeling hazy but rested 
get dressed, get away from the stress 
gave my lady a kiss, savor it 
made my way into the day with the taste on my lips 
reflecting on relationships 
though 80 percent of ladies I've met seem crazy 
I'm afraid that maybe it's the way we pick mates 
to replace that space left by parents mistakes 
but I'll take all the ups and downs 
gave me substance, something bout 
the struggles make you love to smile 
on days like this 
when you're not afraid to live with what the trade off is 
never been the type to oversimplify 
live a life that I couldn't fit inside a system 
my decisions should be different 
depending on the kind of the situation 
just takes a little time 

[Chorus]
days, days go by 
and life goes on 
life goes on 
it's just a moment of time 
and life goes on 
life goes on 

[Toby]
don't care what you expect me to do 
as long as I can respect every step that I move 
nothing is destined, I just do the best I can do 
might add a little stress but it's the lesser of two 
evils, see I have this need to wrestle with truth 
every second is a lesson unless you refuse 
no one's perfect, I accept it too but few get it 
I dare whoever steps in my shoes to do better 
ignored the wisdom of the joyless 
that says taking risks just gives you disappointments 
it's annoying, as if you can avoid it 
cause it's a bigger risk just to listen to their voices 
use to sing til they told me to stop 
the older I got, was scolded, told to go get a job 
folded and bought what they sold but lost the control 
so I shot for my goals like no one had thought 

[Chorus] 
days, days go by 
and life goes on 
life goes on 
it's just a moment of time 
and life goes on 
life goes on 

it's a moment in time 
and it goes and it goes 
life goes on 
it's a moment in time 
and it goes and it goes</pre>
