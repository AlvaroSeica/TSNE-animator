[Intro: Pimp C]
Everybody wanna ball, everybody wanna ball
Everybody wanna ball, holla at broads at the mall
Everybody wanna ball, everybody wanna ball
Everybody wanna ball, nigga I can't fuck witch'all

[Pimp C]
Uhhh; I'm still smokin out, po'in up, puttin dick up in yo' slut
Niggaz look I'm sayin "What," hustlin not in a rut
Gettin down on the grind, puttin meat up in they spine
Young girl lookin fine, comin back with the whole nine
Grip the 'llac, do the track, young go there off the map
Hit the sack, drop seven grams, watch it bubble back
All heart, never fraud, only trustin in the Lord
Never in no man mouth; represent the whole South
Everybody wanna be the boy gettin rich (rich)
Everybody wanna have a bad ass bitch (bitch)
Everybody want a 'llac, wanna blow the doja sack
Everybody wanna come through with the full pack

[Chorus: Pimp C]
Everybody wanna ball, holla at broads at the mall
If he up, watch him fall, nigga I can't fuck witch'all
Everybody wanna ball, holla at broads at the mall
If he up, watch him fall, nigga I can't fuck witch'all
Everybody wanna ball, everybody wanna ball
Everybody wanna ball, holla at broads at the mall
Everybody wanna ball, everybody wanna ball
Everybody wanna ball, nigga I can't fuck witch'all

[Bun B]
I'm the king pullin the strings, the man behind the man
And the trillest, swear to it, with Bible in my hand
Represent it for the G's (and who?) the real trill fellas
And the hood's the barrio (what?) even the {?}
tried to tell us we couldn't do it, don't even try
They almost had me believin that shit, I won't even lie
I had to look 'em in they eye to see the hate in they heart
See everybody can't love you mayne, they just playin they part (for real)
I was taught to play my position and wait for my shot
And win the game, blow the spot, fuck who like it or not
You can't please everybody (no) you might as well please you
And keep it 100 with yourself, just like the G's do (like the G's do)

[Chorus]

[Pimp C]
Uhhhh; everybody wanna have a platinum ass dick (dick)
Or a gold ass pussy, don't you wanna break a trick? (trick)
Don Magic Juan told me to stay true (true)
It's all about the green, not the red or the blue (blue)
The lean, flat screens and the disc say Screw (Screw)
Leanin on a switch (switch) pressin on ya bitch (bitch)
You don't put no gun to your brother head, nigga
Don't put your rubber on like you're squeezin a trigger
On your swipe, shine bright, in the dark or the light
VVS prime cut, 92 karats, I'm right
In the prong set link chain, grippin on the woodgrain
Young girls suckin on my dick like it's a chicken wang
