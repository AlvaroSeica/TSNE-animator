[Aaron Hall]
When I had.. you had
Where I was.. that's where you were
By my side that's where you stood, can you feel me?
And then you wanted to go out there and play me?
(Check it out) Are you crazy?
Yo Biggie how we do it?

[Notorious B.I.G.]
Now Biggie Smalls is not the type to fall in love wit 'em
Hit 'em and forget 'em and go handle my business 
What is this wit you, all you wanna do is lay around
and stay around, and get mad when I play around
Tuesday I saw you in the Z, but you still wanna get with me
Wednesday is the Benz day, that's what your friends say
So I guess you think I'm slippin cause I ain't flippin
Baby I'm Big Poppa ain't no need to be trippin

[Aaron Hall] [Background singing]
You know that I care - baby
Why you keep on stressin me
I'm walkin out the door - baby
Is this how you want it to be?
When you used to call

Chorus:
[I came runnin to you]
And when you were with me
[I gave it all to you]
Can't nobody do it like me
[Fulfill your wildest dreams]
Why ya tryin to play
[So why ya tryin to play me?]

When the tables turn you'll see
I know how it's gonna be
You are gonna beg, to see me
Wanting how it used to be
When you used to call

Chorus

[Notorious B.I.G.]
All I do all day is drink Tanqueray
Thinkin of a way to put a smile on your face
It seems like it's a waste of time, it's why I wrote the rhyme
I hear you jumpin in every car, except for mine
Should I wine and dine you, put rings on your fingers
while sex from the next man in the bedroom lingers?
You betta slow your roll baby
You ain't got enuff dough to pay me
You know the pin number just page me when you real baby
Uh!

Chorus

You should realize
[Be-fore it's too late]
If you love me right
I'll still be here baby
[I'm here for you, make no mistake]
I've had it all before
So girl, why you, tryin to play me?

Chorus: repeat 2X</pre>
