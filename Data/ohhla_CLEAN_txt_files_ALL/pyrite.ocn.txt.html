[Frank Ocean]
Babe just say you miss me, is it that hard?
Too long since I've heard about our love
Am I in this for myself? And hey yeah
with rose colored lenses on my store bought frames
To see somethin other than these blues and grays
I need somethin different, hey yeah yeah yeah
Cause you ain't feelin the same

[Chorus]
Who knows~! Maybe I'm crazy
That's one big maybe
But even a fool knows when it's gold, gold, gold
I know, pyrite from twenty-four karat yeah
Cubics from genuine diamond yeah
A call from the woman who loves you
and hello from a friend
I know when it's real, I know how to tell
I know the difference between what you say and how you feel
Oh, oh I know when it's real

[Frank Ocean]
Oh, I can tell the difference every time that you call
But I don't need a drink I need some time in my car
Time to drive - and think
Time to park - and cry
You shoulda known you were beautiful
You shoulda known what I saw in you yeah
Please forgive me for feelin like it's all your fault
A heavy heart can't carry blame for the loss

[Chorus]

[Frank Ocean]
You might not notice, but I'm a man with pride
And this hurts me baby, deep down deep down
I can't let go of this, gotta know I tried
It's pathetic baby, don't lie don't lie
I'm a candle you're the sun, and you're burning baby
You're burning baby - burnin up, burnin up
Burnin up, burnin up
Burnin up, yeahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

[Outro: Frank Ocean]
Yeahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Pyrite from 24 karat yeah
Cubics from genuine diamond yeah
A call from the woman who loves you
and hello from a friend
We'll never be more than friends
We'll never be</pre>
