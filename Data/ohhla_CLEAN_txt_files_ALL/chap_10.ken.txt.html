In time, you'll learn this is about you
In time, you'll learn this is about you
In time, you'll learn this is about you

[Kendrick Lamar]
Babies from eighties don't know no' better
Don't nothing go better with ignorance
But the belligerent kids that we living with
Some of them masculine, some of them feminine
'Member the universe used to innocent?
Now they just look at us crazy like immigrants
Every day that I wake up, I'ma sin again
I'm not a citizen, I'm just a nigga from Section 80

[Interlude]
Show of hands, how many been taking notes?
Good, leave everything on the table now
On the real, this is your generation
Show, show your pain</pre>
