Chorus (Ms. Tee &amp; Tec-9):

(Ms. Tee)
Get into it with a bitch I gotta tote my shank
(Tec-9)
Get into it with a nigga gotta tote my gun
(Ms. Tee)
Get into it with a bitch I gotta tote my shank
(Tec-9)
Get into it with a nigga gotta tote my gun

First Verse (Ms. Tee):

When I get into it with a bitch, I tote my shank,
Cut them hoes cuz they want that yay,
I gotta watch my back, because them hoes are tryin' to handle me,
Catch me out my shank, and them hoes'll try to get me,
Get up bitch, cuz you know I'm bout to start some shit,
You and your girls, yes you comin' with the foolishness,
But I smack you fuckin' hoes and then I'll grab my nine,
I grab my shank and grab my nine because I gotta get mine

Chorus (2x)

(Tec-9)
Don't come on my set with that bullshit,
I got my glock, got it cocked, watch'em drop
Don't come on my set with that bullshit,
I got my glock, got it cocked, watch'em drop

Second Verse (Tec-9):

I spot a nigga comin' up the block,
Not too familiar with his face, so I run and get my fuckin' glock,
Release my weapon off of safety, and chill,
Fire up a reefa, I'm ready, it's time to kill,
This muthafucka can't fake it,
Stackin' twenty-five, ain't shit you gone be takin',
Because I got my glock, ready to pop, ready to get off with that first shot,
The size of my weapon told that nigga to keep on steppin',
Called up my nigga $lu, close down shop,
Nigga stuntin' with his piece, and he didn't pop,
Nigga gimme your vest, he said it's all good,
Gonna take us a ride through the neighborhood,
I caught that nigga and I gave him one,
Get into it with a nigga gotta tote my gun
