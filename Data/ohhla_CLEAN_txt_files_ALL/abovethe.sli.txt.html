Song:   Above the Clouds
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

We flyin' high above the clouds again
Lookin' down from the clouds
At them holes that I see
Never knowin' to put down your weight
Only thing they know that time be leaving, and it's seven O
Maybe if it was an 'igher day
Any man, any girl, everybody in the world, time freeze
They'll be sippin' on the wine again
Poppin' champagne bottle
Gettin' blunted till my eyes they don't see
Maybe if we were that high again
Taking a trip 'round the world
Sittin' in, and then mine goes up a tree
If you never ask me why again
Is them Endo smoke better to be smoked up than juggle fifty

It's Philly love
Just drinkin' rum
And getting high
Listen to dub
Grip them pint
Get them buds
Spark the light
And get the girl

It's in your blood
Just drinkin' rum
And getting high
Listen to dub
Grip the pint
Get them buds
Spark that light

Fire it up

We flyin' high above the clouds again
Lookin' down from the clouds
At them holes that I see
You be comin' our direction
DEA, don't try, they intercept up, blazin' all of our weed
Instead of droppin bombs on Normandy
Fire one long artillery, smokin' up the enemy
Now we steppin' up an Irie beat
Take your shit, don't hurt, this is herb, yo we be puffin' them green
Now we live the Manu Chao way
King of the Congo, livin' in the jungle
Get hyptnotized like an Egyptian, whoa whoa whoa whoa

It's Philly love
Just drinkin' rum
And getting high
Listen to dub
Grip the pint
Get them buds
Spark the light
Fire it up

It's in the blood
Just drinkin' rum
And getting high
Listen to dub
Grip the pint
Get them buds
Spark the light
Fire it up</pre>
