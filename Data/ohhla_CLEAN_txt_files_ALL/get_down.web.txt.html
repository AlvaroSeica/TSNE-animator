Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Let me get my fresh on
Next on deck
I just breeze through easy
I haven't stopped yet
People give me damages
Of sign of respect for me
Doin' my damn thing
Without breaking a sweat

Look at me now
I'm doing it
That's word on my life
Even this bummy ass white boy
Can clean up nice
Button up on
Hat crooked to the right
Don't gotta look in the mirror
'Cause I know that I'm tight
Right?

I'm just here to have a hell of a night
And I'm ready to get twisted
Grab the L and a light
I know this hip hop game's
Just a roll of the dice
But I know that I'm nice
That's why I'm holding the mic

Flowin' precise
Whoever knew this stoner could write?
And spit venom
Get ready for the cobra to strike
The end of the night
Shit
It ain't nowhere in sight
So stay rockin' with your boy
'Cause the future look bright

So we get down
Bottles in the air
Dutch full of the kush
And my people everywhere
And we get down
Swag on high
Windows low
Base bumpin' in the ride
So we get down
Ladies lookin' sexy as hell
You want a good time?
The Webby as well
So we get down
Fill another cup
'Cause we goin' from now
Till the sun come up
What?

I get down
Like I never wanna get up
I'll never let up
But keep my head up
Dead up
Fed up
But not having my bread up
But still I'm going all in
Bitch
Put your bed up

Shred up
Any track given to me
It ain't hard for all my dogs
And my women to see
That I can't wait to be king
Simba's living in me
So I'm a roll with it
Kill 'em all subliminally

Don't even try gettin' at me
It just ain't worth it
'Cause I ain't never seen a mother fucker
Beat perfect
Got my own title
And I damn sure heard
That ain't nothing I got now
I didn't deserve bitch

My feet left the surface of Earth
'Cause I'm too fly
And I don't ever have to come down
Do I?
Who I be
W-E-double B-Y
Now who's fucking with me?

So we get down
Bottles in the air
Dutch full of the kush
And my people everywhere
And we get down
Swag on high
Windows low
Base bumpin' in the ride
So we get down
Ladies lookin' sexy as hell
You want a good time?
The Webby as well
So we get down
Fill another cup
'Cause we goin' from now
Till the sun come up
What?

Get down
Like your girl on her knees
And I got it in my car
When we shootin' a breeze
And I wish I can leave
The snow and the leaves
And see the palm trees
Get blown by mommies

And if y'all don't say
My dick's bigger than Tom Lee
And I'm tryin' to get a piece
Like my name's Ghandi
Got my own shake
Ridin' behind me
My back seat's big enough
So get inside me

I murder this rap shit
Murder this rap shit
Rollin' out the club like
Stuck in the trap bitch
Tell all these dudes
Don't jack my tactics
Bubby, I got you
You don't got to ask it

Just wipe 'em off
Like a god damn napkin
Whatever
These dudes
Shouldn't even be rapping
See
Me and you gotta purpose
They should be at Mickeys (McDonalds)
Flippin' up burgers

So we get down
Bottles in the air
Dutch full of the kush
And my people everywhere
And we get down
Swag on high
Windows low
Base bumpin' in the ride
So we get down
Ladies lookin' sexy as hell
You want a good time?
The Webby as well
So we get down
Fill another cup
'Cause we goin' from now
Till the sun come up
What?</pre>
