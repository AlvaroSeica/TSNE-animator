Typed by: Tha Masta

[Intro: G-Roc]
G-Roc be popping off, Izzy Workin be popping off (that's right)
We know J-Specs be popping off (uh-huh), we thought Perm and Bird would pop off
But apparantly they knockoffs, yo spin that shit...
Yeah, y'all, fucking pop ya head like a pumpkin
This is North Yard Riot Starters, buckle up

[Chorus 2X: Mr. Prezident (with Specman)]
When shit get thick we (pop off)
North Yard (pop off) Riot Starters (pop off)
We grind hard, sun up to sun down
Northside, Bodytown, S.K.s and four-pounds

[Izzy Workin]
You got nothing and you bragging, no cameras and you acting
Don't give 'em, we snatching, no planned trip but I stay packing
Shadow Gov 'bout to cash in, only family on the stage when I'm rapping
If it jumps off, we ain't get searched, my whole team clapping
Rock a jersey here and there but I ain't caught up in fashion
I scream on beats, call it harassment
And I, scheme on dealers with duct tape and a ratchet
Only smoke purple haze that comes in a casket
My life is drastic, there's reasons to my madness
Look into my mom's eyes, and see sadness
Everyday, get dough, still feel like shit
Laugh and joke with my friends, but sometimes I wanna slit my wrist

[Black]
Move like I ain't grinding right
While I ain't gotta whip out something on my wrist that'll blind ya sight
I'm like, chill, look, I'm alright
Got it locked, from the 'dro to the dough to the China white
It's a wrap when I lift the ratchet
Get clapped, by a center hole clip through ya Sixer jacket
Damn, Black on that shit, better get this bastard
'Fore I have ya man, lift ya casket
Dogs that don't rap no more, I could show you what the gats is for
I put the beam on ya brain, pop, crack ya skull
Know, Black don't wait for cash
Run up on ya, long gun with the Jason mask

[Chorus 2X]

[Mr. Prezident]
Can't, nothing fade me, it's Prezzy, baby
Rock ice like igloos, my swagger's crazy
Ask ya lady, yo, I'm sick like rabies
That's why she'll give me brain and drink me babies
It's off the rocker, Bodytown toaster popper
Two 4, North Yard, thought ya note ya glock up
Blow ya spot up, man, I'll blow ya block up
If ya come, come correct or get ya dolja shot up
Not for nothing, y'all better stop the fronting
Cuz when shit pop off y'all ain't popping nothing
Lock the function, I keep a fist full of ice
Hear me on my hip, screaming "Fuck the po-lice"

[Specman]
Money in lumps, I hop out the truck, I'm icy as fuck
Shadow Government, what? Who you running with suck
Got snobs in the club and pumps in the trunk
Get or take a couple hundred wolves in the cut
What's Up? Get silly, The Milli'll split ya head like a Phillie
What really the deal? We all wage war in the field
We all stick together like clumps of haze
Specs blow shows and those up on stage
You know, can't behave, too much time in the cage
Since a very young age, I'm filled up with rage

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
