Ah man I've had too much to drink
I don't feel so good

[Verse 1]
From in underage access, to in excess
To obsessed, possessed with alcohol's presence
Got me acting like a peasant, many a mistake
But I still sip it at the present, whiff it from my breath
Scull the beer, finish off the dregs, pass out on the bed
Wake up with my face feeling red
And my head aches, a mistake to take more cash to the counter
An all nighter, all rounder, I found the
liquor really only makes you sicker, I'm quick ta
rip the mic on drunken nights, though my sight ain't 20/20
And now my bottles empty, but I still got plenty of energy
Informed the watermelon is a good remedy
for the morning after, I've tried to quit many a time
But I guess I'll have to try harder ...try a little bit harder
First came the Spumante, then the Jim Beam
Tap dripping dreams, then carrots and kidney beans
Then streams of beer, which led to dehydration
I used to drink only on the special occasions
Now I do whilst sitting in front of the Playstation
Maybe while skating, or when the barbie's blazing
Thought I was just phasing, it used to have me chasing the chicks
Hoping to get licked, then I got the drunken nicotine fix
With a strong stomach, nowadays it's rare for me to ever be sick
You know? To blow fucking chunks with the pineapple lumps?
And to think it's all supposed to be just a bit of fun

[Verse 2]
It all began as rebellion, getting pissed, kissed and always telling
Tripping, slipping and yelling
But I fell in the trap, now I sip the beer from longies
Cans, stubbies, and sometimes even off tap
Put a brew in my lap, I try to knock it back
But my mind just snaps, now emcees would you give it up
just for your raps? Perhaps, well I know I could
Probably should, would it really make a difference?
Save the money and spend it on better equipment
More CDs on the underground shipment
I'm living in a world that's dependent, not an alcoholic
The beer is my friend when I'm feeling blue
Takes me away, would you like to come too?
But it ain't the land of the true, it's filled with misconceptions
like my name, shit ain't really changed
I still pop the cells sitting within my brain</pre>
