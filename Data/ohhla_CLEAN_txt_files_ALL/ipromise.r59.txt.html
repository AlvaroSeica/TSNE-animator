Yeah, yeah yeah
There's a void that needs to be filled inside this marketplace
You could die in my parkin space
My mom want me to blow up and house them
My father want me to bring product out without Slim
And prove them wrong - they paid my bills
I'm on your heels, I'm for real, my shoes is long
To feed my son - I will leave you
leakin in the street, I will heat you to kingdom come
Uhh, the king will come
Wait 'til you gone in place of a angel appear to take you home
The beard on the face is gone
These bullets is straight razors, blazin you, case in point
Amaze the rap game, make 'em point
Walk inside of the house of the illest and case the joint
And take whatever I want, out of it
Now that I'm wise, my future rides on it, it's time for triumph

[Chorus: Royce Da 5'9"] + (Ingrid Smalls)
I promise  if you just let me in the game (Prayyyy)
If you should bless me enough to let me reign, I will contain you (Prayyyy)
I promise  I will support my family, slash you (Prayyyy)
I promise  I will pray every day, I will ask you
I promise  if you just let me in the game (Prayyyy)
If you should bless me enough to let me reign, I will contain you (Prayyyy)
I promise  I will stop the killin, I will change (Prayyyy)
I promise  I will put in this flow, what you put in my soul

[Royce Da 5'9"]
The whole misconception with me
The only thing people think that I'm arrogant when they don't know me
That's what it was
If I wasn't a real nigga the shit would not bother me but it does
The shit is not fair
Just picture yourself lookin in the mirror tryna change what is not there
When niggaz stop speakin
Them phone calls get slow, I'm feelin like Nas before he dropped "Ether"
I appear to be sober
I'ma really be runnin over whoever said that my career was over
Whoever gave me the cold shoulder
And turn they backs on me, I'll be blazin you from both coasts
Believe me, I got Lil' Homie and July 6
So you funny actin ass producers, I don't need you
You can keep yo' beats, rap for money
FUCK you and everybody else who acted funny

[Chorus]

[Royce Da 5'9"]
Uhh, I'm callin every nigga out in the game
that tried to go against the fire and douse the flame
I could shout yo' name
But nobody stands out more than anybody else, you doubt the same
For every nigga that say I'm hidin
just because I ain't hangin out at the same places I once vibed in
Everybody at my father's job askin him rumors, shit
Stop as my dad soon gon' quit
If I can, maybe thank him for raising me
to think like a baby gangsta, crazy temper
I paid my sentence  totaled out the prison
the game sent me, fame owes my name plus interest
But once you strapped in to the penmanship
and the track rumbles, you trapped in this rap jungle
When you can't come through, sales are numbers
The one who prevails'll be the one who remain tumbled

[Chorus]

[Royce] What you put in my soul.. {*echoes*}

[Ingrid Smalls]
Prayyyy, prayyyy, prayyyy
Prayyyy, prayyyy, prayyyy.. {*fades out*}</pre>
