[Beace]
I've been true since communion with the strategic union
Lyrical baptism by fire, Microphone henchmen for hire
Put distance between me thieves and liars
My nickname Painkiller, Could doctor hip hop synopsis
While vacation I put my wife in the tropics
With ten stacks in my pocket, Dog I got vision like eye socket
Stick to the script, Get gripped, Focus on the topic, Trouble shoot robotics
Gassed off the math lab, Graphed them functions
Attend honor society lunch ins, Tote'n a spiral binder to Pathfinder
Get a load of Corey, Trailblazer to road to glory
In a big body Denali burn your buddy a copy
I flow sloppy, I get from point A to B on tracks like a jalopy
Crafty with a mechanical pencil, My sixteen bar stencil
Rekindled hip hop's golden age in a major way

[Kevlaar 7]
Yo, I wrestled with the Giants, Hood Patriot defiant
Tom Brady of the game, Fuck the fame I'm Joe Gilley
I'm willing when knowledge and violence collides with number two pencils
Deep breath, Vast Aire I'll leave you a stencil
Crooked as a pretzel, On Training Day I trained Denzel
Washington D.C. could never see the sniper in you
We don't need you people at this venue
Wisemen come through on attack boat, Barack boat
My first stack blown, Buying S.K.'s on impulse
Spending false Franklin's I got from the bank when my bitch worked the counter
But the bitch flopped when the milli hit the counter
I ran to the van Dinero hit the odometer

[Bronze Nazareth]
It's like I was born with a gun to my head
Woke up with the blood shed, Umbilical bleed
Like an age testament, I born best of bred men
That said it was something special that lead them to him
Same man sing a church hymn that infringe your chin
Fourth down blitzing, Motor mouth hit men
Who bred buy the ways of world and how the man pitching
On the mound watching his men in the outfield trying to strike me out
I peace piped it out, Smoke thoughts to burn a house
Turned young Tina Turner out, Walk in the precinct with a burner out
No shots, Blow shots, Sparks the scream about
Verner's three ounce, Sermons remount
Komodo dragon puff under stars so I could breathe out
Suffer God's at leave, Help, Seen stealth young death
Murder breath, Chromosome lead me to crack home
Attack zones, City like the Congo
Sudan, Stop homicide, Face branded a man child
Witness me pulling in fifths tremendously empty
Sinister melody, Simmer the rice
I'd rather shot it out then see Dion on the dice
Running like a cat after mice, Shatter your ice thoughts
Priceless mic volts, Tainted in our spike vaults
Hypest crack head to discover meth's cyclone
Damn this is wrong, Should be drinking tequila with my cousin but he gone
Goddamnit, One through the chest bone
Pinelly County bloods coming jail home
Bury your bones by the same goons who buried Hoffa
Send a bloody shank, Merry Christmas Momma
Cry me a bloody river, Your man die if he cried when they hit him
Bullets spit in war zone prison, I risen like gas price
High class wife I harass for the cash price
Pass it to backwood grass rap pipe

That's it nigga, that's right</pre>
