Chorus: 1x 
It's the end of tha world foo, some times is gettin hard 
Ridin in that black, earth falls to the graveyard 
We livin in hell and not knowin 
Still flowin 
The crime rate still growin 
It's the end of tha world foo, so times is gettin hard 
Ridin in that black, earth falls to the graveyard 
We livin in hell and not knowin 
Still flowin 
The crime rate still growin 

Verse 1: 
The world is a ghetto trapped in our minds 
But they can't stop crime 
Ya got ya life on the borderline 
When is your time? 
You never know when you gon' go 
Get it right when you can before you knockin on every do' 
They got crooked cops workin for the system 
Makin the less fortunate ones out of victims 
But it's a shame they drop drugs and slugs 
It's a whiteman's world and never sho' no luv 
The president movin ki's 
back and forth from overseas 
Distroyin this nation, bringin blacks to there knees 
It's hard time (?) killin their own kids 
New borns in trash cans, stuck with nowhere to live 
Back in the day smoke a lil herb was all cool 
Now they got dope fiends dreamin of blood pools 
(?) could fight, shit, off and go their way 
But these days 
They fight with choppers and AK's 
From sun up from sun down I'm here to stay 
We all must pray 
And thank the Lord for another day 

Chorus:1x 

Verse 2: 
I'm beginnin to think this world is at it's full peak 
but believe I ain't considerate with my own conception 
I seek the light but still got wrong directions 
Reflections 
Of some of my childhood peers that be diseaced 
I'd love to see chances of livin long havin (?) 
No peace 
I wanna consult my psychic and peep through that crystal 
At my future (?) my life contains of drugs and pistols 
I wanna survive 8 years parole or will the system fade me 
Cuz though shit seems to come out right it's like I'm constipated 
Live ain't nothin but bitch shit but a fuckin wrist of ever 
I gots to get my shit together 
and do whatever 
It takes to make and clock a million in this ghetto 
My fear is won't invest in no 
Petty-hard death row 
I'm takin a major step at crime 
Even though da mind throw thangs behind 
(?) kaotic minds 
Pullin them cats of writin rhymes 
Religious and reliable too many hypocrits 
Put my truck to no man, ever since is way ole Texas shit 
Could nigga be trippin actin like they Jesus 
But then they wants to know reasons 
Of these unfamiliar (?) diseases 
Mislead you, never 
I'm here to proceed you with a ghetto prophet 
So by killin me still fulfill your empty pockets 
Could money bring you pain as well as money could bring you power 
They'll probably arrange some other religion that you may never gon' follow 
I'm talkin (?) for my niggas taken on by the trials 
Hopin to reach you and put out that everlastin fire 
Cuz in this world all I'm seein here is crimes and crooks 
So turn your mutha fuckin head this way and take a look 

Chorus:1x 

Verse 3: 
I heard a blast and jumped in my bed 
With the quickness reach for the front door 
turn the nob looked out and said "What is it?" 
It's the end of the world and every soul has expired 
These streets are ripped apart and these buildings catchin on fire 
So I dropped to my knees to begged the Lord fo forgiveness 
With one tear rollin down my face cuz my soul ain't forgiven this 
When the ground cracked open and the devil came up 
He said "Nigga, pack your shit because you're comin wit us!" 
Now I got realize that I'll be livin in hell 
Eternal rest in peace in fire ain't no way to beg bail 
But we got to except about the way that we livin 
And make decisions bout killin and feelin bout how I'll be feelin 
Is you hear what I'm hearin, is you sayin what I'm speakin 
These (?) bad, they be in the streets tweekin 
So leave them bustas alone and get your mind right bitch 
Cuz it's the end of the world and we gotta think quick 

Chorus: 1x 

Verse 4: 
Ugh 
We got drug contimination 
AIDs infestation 
Blacks to 'nother blacks in a slave-free nation 
Ya betta get it right, ya betta pray for your soul 
So that fire and flame won't be in ya crossroad 
Open your eyes, and let this light shine through 
This world is comin to an end so what the fuck you gon' do 
Wit the murderers, killas, and 20-second car jackers 
Terrorists, dealers, and master computer hackers 
Back in the days you could trust your church pastor (amen) 
But not unless you wanna murder that bastard 
Hope your healthy, wit no disease you're pure 
Cuz the doctors can't help they claim they got no cure 
Scared to look at the news, another plague bein spread 
Or finding out my mother was found tradgically dead 
This whole world's gonna burn but I'm prepared to fry 
Like an electric chair victim gettin prepared to die 
Look out fo thugs wit a glock 
It's straight up shop or get chopped 
Dope fiends non-stop 
I smoked the whole damn block 
We livin in the murder capitol way down south 
Where if you start to get proved you get a gauge in your mouth 
Ya betta repeat you know the deal 
Car bombs and all steel 
This world's comin to an end 
That's how it is that's on the real 

Chorus:1x (fades to end) </pre>
