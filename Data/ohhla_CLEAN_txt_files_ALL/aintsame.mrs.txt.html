[Mr. Serv-On]
What's up Big Ed?
[Big Ed]
Just chillin man
[Serv-On]
What's up with you and your girl bro?
[Big Ed]
Man I don't fuck with that ho, that bitch is stupid, she don't fuck with a
gangsta yo
[Serv-On]
Man I aint tryin to hear that shit.  I go fuck with that other side, ya know
what I'm sayin?
[Big Ed]
I heard ya bro
[Serv-On]
She's a goody goody bitch, and I don't fuck with those type, ya know what I'm
sayin. Those are the type of bitches I'll fuck though!  Ha ha

[Serv-On]
You your mommas girl, I'm my mommas thug
You wanna hold hands, I wanna feel your ass when we hug
You like quiet walks in the park, I like smoking weed and fucking fine bitches
after dark
You like riding in suburban jags, I like getting my balls licked and getting
my dick sucked
You like college stitches, I like gangsta bitches
I like hitting hoes from the back, you like hitting niggas for thier riches
(money)
So game recognize game (recognize), I got the pussy bitch before I got the
name
You still want respect, then pay the dinner check (pay it)
I wanna hit it again, oh by the way last night I fucked your friend
You Mary Kay, I'm cemetary made
You bout reading books, I'm bout dirty looks and getting paid
You bout zaphadills, I'm bout 40's by the case
You call a nigga to play in your hair, I'll put some dick up in your face (in
your face)
You want a one on one, I'm bout my homies getting some
So until then (it aint no fun), keep the pussy tight and everything will be
all right
We aint the same, fuck you, you know the game

[Mo B. Dick]
We aint the same, cause my mind is somewhere else
We aint the same, aint the same

[Serv-On]
You like a nigga to rub your back (fuck that)
I like a bitch buck-naked to help me bag dope and count my stack
You like fancy resteraunts with guards at the door
I like Anitas after four where I can see all the bitches I fucked before
You like niggas with gator sweaters on
I like bitches with golds in thier mouth, daniel greens and cellular phones
You like comedy shows
I like getting fucked up and going to strip shows and finger fucking hoes
I guess you say I'm kinda nasty
You your mommas angel, thats the way my brother fucking raised me
You wanna go to Spain, I wanna hang in the projects and jump up in the dice
game
You like plays and operas, I like betting how long it's gonna take for KL to
fuck ya
You like niggas who your momma likes
I like a bitch with a momma that still knows how to loosen up a dick when a
dick is tight
You like to eat Japanese, I like shipping white bricks from overseas
Now that's enough of my business, so I'm gonna let this last and final fuck be
my witness
So what I'm really saying, things will never change
In other words bitch, we aint the same

[Mo B. Dick]
We aint the same, cause my mind is somewhere else
We aint the same, girl stop playin with yourself
We aint the same, aint the same

[Big Ed]
I see you almost every day and I'm wishing
That you would pay attention and pick up on the vibes I'm sending
See baby I'm with that TRU click, No Limit soldiers hustlin to make a grip
I know what your thinking T-R-U, y'all too rowdy
Leave the party cloudy, hit the skins and then we outie
I'm a pistol totin' G, Big Ed on something, we're from two different world but
don't front
I hang with killers, I'm ready for revolution
You see I'm hustling, looking for the solution
You feel drawn by my strength I'm captivated by your touch
Hoping that we can get together for a passing clutch
I got your back, I'll bust a cap 
Relax and lay back, five-o kid, hold my strap
College girl, I'm a street baller, walking side by side hitting switches in
the six-four and pause

[Mo B. Dick]
Don't give a fuck I'm gonna bust a quick nut so I take you to the motel
Nigga from the hood and I'm up to no good and I hope that you dont tell
Cause I just want you to know that it's nothing but a fuck thang
I don't want no relationship, girl we aint the same
We aint the same, cause my mind is somewhere else
We aint the same, so girl stop playing with yourself
We aint the same, cause in my heart there's nothing left
We aint the same, we aint the same</pre>
