[Intro] [Grouch Talking]
Say what? Hip hop

[Chorus] [x2]
This is for the true
People that I met in this game, thank you
I never will forget
And this is for my crew
To everything we been through
The blood and the sweat
And to those who aren't knowin' yet
Fuck you
To those who aren't showin' it them we been in this shit to the end

[Verse One]
It's rather amazing 
Us fazing this planet with the elements
For, we adore
Open for, we are tellin' it
Sellin' it and buyin' it
Lovin' it, tryin' it
New ways, always, we all play a role in it
All day I'm holdin' it down
Crown myself the king of the sound
I bring it around
Where I roam
Any zone, come alone
Leave with friends, come with friends
Leave with many more
I'm a penny more
Continue to make dollars
They hear the hollers
Soon fathers teach sons till it comes
Natural
This is for the batch who'll
Bring it to the next level then repeat that
Hold the weak back till they can freak that
Which they can
And it expands to ever nook 
So every hook I'm inkin' out
Got you thinkin' 'bout
Somethin'
Jumped into the game
To make change, a name, use my brain
Aim has been met
I'm further in debt, yep
Kept pushin'
Even when they wouldn't listen, radio diss 'em
Failin' at they mission and not knowin'
I talk slow and
Instead of fast
Headed past pussy ass position holders
Without boulders between they legs
They spreadin' plagues
I've said ways any and all can understand
I still wonder
Damn
I still wonder

[Chorus] [x2]
This is for the true
People that I met in this game, thank you
I never will forget
And this is for my crew
To everything we been through
The blood and the sweat
And to those who aren't knowin' yet
Fuck you
To those who aren't showin' it them we been in this shit to the end

[Verse Two]
From the second we press record
A reason to kick it was made
He get's paid, hey
Display talent he gave
Trouble, I made double on a tape sale
Than my hourly wage
And I can't praise cowardly ways
I stay around hustlers and hang out
Go to other parts, check your thing out
Qualities you bring out
Evolve with these traits 
We keep faith, keep wastin' rules
We learn how to earn and still be cool
I'm gonna rule the underground first
Later fuck the majors over
Slower players do your job
Hit the gob of green, hit the top queen
There's no stoppin'
No matter if you're talking in another language
Strangest thoughts got light in the spotlight
Not like they used to get, no I can't get used it
Faith that I paraded through a foreign land
Scorin'
Damn good points
When people threw my joints
There's no equal to this movement
I only want improvement
Daily
Maybe folks can feel me through my baby
Hip hop save me
Without you I'd be crazy
A lazy man with no friends and no ends

[Chorus] [x2]
This is for the true
People that I met in this game, thank you
I never will forget
And this is for my crew
To everything we been through
The blood and the sweat
And to those who aren't knowin' yet
Fuck you
To those who aren't showin' it them we been in this shit to the end</pre>
