[Chorus: Scoe]
"Thank you Doctor"
Reminiscing when we used to smoke chronic
Now we puffing the kush
I'm like, "Thank you Doctor"
For giving the West Coast CPR
Now here we are
We'd like to, "Thank you Doctor"
We can never pay you pack
All the shit you did for Hip Hop and gangster rap
For that, "Thank you Doctor"
Without further adieu
Diggy Doc, this one is for you, uh huh

[Scoe]
I remember growing up, just a Dogg Pound pup
Bumping "G Thang", it's that "Gin and Juice" in my cup
And all I knew was N.W.A.
Eazy, Yella and Ren, Ice Cube and Dre
Big Snoop, Warren G, Nate Dogg and Rage
Kurupt and Daz, RBX, the original gang
Bad Azz, Soopafly, I can go on for days
D.P.G.C., that's the way I was raised
And motherfucking 2Pac was my shit
Especially when he was rocking on the Doc shit
Killa Cali where it all started, a legacy
Me? I'm just happy to be a part of it
This west shit, it's history in the making
This is the next step, California's best kept, yep
It's young Scoe, I'm a Y.A. gangster rider
On behalf of South Central L.A., we wanna

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
I remember when it all started
On Alondra in that small apartment, burgundy carpet and Sega cartridges
Poppa flicking blunt ashes all on his garments
Momma off of wine cooler, Magic Johnson playing Jordan
I was only four, but it's like I heard it before
A house party cracking off of the music Doctor record
And according to my awareness, I was more than coherent
A cold listener, marking that shit like a parrot
My cousins kicking up dust Cripping, they flag, wear it
round they hand like a mitten, aiming, use it for leverage
Shitting on Compton sheriffs like "Fuck the Police"
Woofers and gold Rollies, every swap meet should know me
Cause I copped every record that dropped
Dropped a dub just to hear Doc drop a jewel for the sake of Hip Hop
Whoever thought the moment I seen you on Bullis for "Cali' Love"
Fifteen years later you'd be saving my life, what?
