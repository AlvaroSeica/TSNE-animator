[Intro: La the Darkman]
Bear witness to the science, SSR

[La the Darkman]
I'm cooler than the Fonz yo, rap Barry Bonds yo
Me and my regime, wonderful ensemble
Barrel with a gun, long nose like Gonzoe
Shooters at your crib in the morning like Alonzo
Might buy a car and truck for a combo
Only off two bricks, my hustle that sick
Right back, see papi say "Damn, you quick"
I reply "You know I gotta get that grip"
So I move and I shake, let the baking soda bake
When I'm done, make the razors scrape the place
Start bagging at twelve, won' finish till eight
Could work from the early morn till it gets late
I got twenty solders, everybody gets an eighth
All on assignment, charging twenty eight
Now multiply that by what everybody bring back
And you gon say "Damn, La got it like that"

[Willie the Kid]
Ayo niggas know Willie for the style I got
The flow I got, how I blow up spots
I count money by the knots and I load up glocks
Mad birds by the flock, skies burned from the watch
Back shots all day, but I prefer to get top
Roll the purplest pac and roll convertable tops
And my niggas in the trap, cooking and working the lot
Keep your eyes on the pot, cops circle the block
My IPod is on lock, tunr it up one notch
'95 mixtapes, Murda Mase and The LOX
And you jealous ass niggas still hating alot
Maybe if we switched lives then the hating would stop
Dollar bills to the roof, I've been caking alot
Teh seamless Air Force see through white sock
Never ride beatbox till the s class drops
I forsee, you can ask B. Cox
Willie the Kid is the crack on the block</pre>
