I said it's a wonderful year...
I said it's a wonderful year...
Here we go, uh...
 
[Von Pea]
Young enough for iPods, old enough for Walkmans
Too young for park jams, by the time I came 
They sealed street lamps, no more of that vibe
but everywhere I went there was still rap, I
grew up in Bed Stuy, real life Mookie
Listening to "Buggin' out" walkin past PookieÂ’s
I guess it helps build character
Older gods listenin to Kane talking Africa
+Smooth Operator+, Cee on the fader 
Cee lead to Big and you know what came later
You wanna talk music in the streets? Imagine "Hypnotize" 
blastin as his body was carried through Bed Stuy
Diddy had Ma$e/mace and the cops did too
Pepper-sprayed during our brother's parade
We just wanted to send him off properly and thank him
Music our outer sanctum, it's a wonderful year
 
("Between the streets of music! ..ic!")
I said it's a wonderful year...
(music! ..ic!")
I said it's a won-..

Fell in love face first, when I heard Kane's verse
Maybe it was Todd Shaw "Life is Too $hort"
Sounds like it cause it made life matter man
The music in them streets, made a LOTTA moments magic
Like the first song you played when you got them Ls'
I was prol'ly bumpin Ant Banks or Quik myself
In my mom's whip frontin, tryna get us some girls
House speakers in the hatchback, the shit sounded terrible!
I'm from Ohio, so when Bone Thugs dropped
Slid that in the deck right next to Pac
Then I moved to Carolina when that OutKast dropped
The blue big weed, bumpin C-N-N and Nas
But, now I'm in the style where they set up shop
Pulled the sound system out and yellow taped the block
They could hate it online, but if the streets say go
All for kill would spins, you'd be ghetto gold
YO!
 
I said it's a wonderful year...
I said it's a wonderful year...

Yo, yo, check.. 
Music in the park, that pure art
that year marks the real.. for real
Pac and Big in that stereo shit
Poppin willies of the sound to the Illadelph, Halflife
Roots to the past, they feel the past get mad hyped
Hit at Nas, then they act like
Boom baps rap like comin from the back of the Ac'
Them Wu tracks had us breakin our necks, kept them haters in check
Kept them tapes in the deck, man we played 'em to death
Had MAD flavor, before swag you heard the urge to stack paper
Major game players, the fame made 'em 
some main stayers, then we zone out 
Old heads told us to turn it down
Had a couple of lame neighbors sayin we run it loud
Shut it down, never that, still bumpin hella tracks
with +Flava for ya Ears+ to get that feeling back
Let's GO~!
