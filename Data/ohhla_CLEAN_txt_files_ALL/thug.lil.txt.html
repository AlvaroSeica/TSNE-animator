[Chorus]
My niggas thug, my niggas thug
We ball 'bout 25 deep to the club
I need some tear sip, I'm a show you who to scrap
They won't let me in, 'cause they know I'm a thug
My niggas thug, my niggas thug
We ball 'bout 25 deep to the club
I need some tear sip, I'm a show you who to scrap
They won't let me in, 'cause they know I'm a thug

What happen to all these motherfuckers in you know what I mean they really
Hatin' on the thugs while you motherfuckers
Out here, ready to not tryin' to let me in the club
So man they say, you for me I'm thuggin too hard, man
Well, you know what?
I'm a thug for real, aha
You know, I could be a nerd, I could be whatever
Whatever you wanna call it
But I'm a tell you one thing
I'm a motherfucking up thug
I'm a tell you 'bout me

I'm a fuckin thug, niggas know what's up
That's what, they don't wanna let me in this bitch
Come fuck via, tell me about, straight to the front
I'm respected in the streets, let me in the club
Go up your squad, if you out your thug
Niggas know my past, they said I'm a thug
Nigga said Lil B, you must be a thug
Leanin' on the curb, your boy off drugs
I can't believe I mean hear everything... a month
I can't believe I did everything in life, this in the streets
And the son bitches, don't wanna let me in the motherfucking club
They act like I'm not thuggin', okay
Just because you're not thuggin' does not mean you can refuse me at the club
I'm a thug, and I demand my rights

[Chorus]
My niggas thug, my niggas thug
We ball 'bout 25 deep to the club
I need some tear sip, I'm a show you who to scrap
They won't let me in, 'cause they know I'm a thug
My niggas thug, my niggas thug
We ball 'bout 25 deep to the club
I need some tear sip, I'm a show you who to scrap
They won't let me in, 'cause they know I'm a thug</pre>
