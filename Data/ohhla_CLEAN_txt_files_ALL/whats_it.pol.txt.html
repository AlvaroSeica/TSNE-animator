[Dirt Gritie]
Ma come and take a walk with me
Come and talk with me
By my sides where you ought to be 
I see them other fellaz looking at you awkwardly 
Hawking B, is it cause you wanting me 
But that right there, don't mean a thing girl
To be Queen you need a King girl 
Gucci, prada, expensive leather 
If you just chin chilla I'll do you better 
Like a foot massage, a back massage 
A neck massage and that ain't all 
If you're ever in trouble then to me you call 
If I'm down on my knees then to you I crawl 
Cause we don't really need a thing girl
You got me and I got you girl
Who would believe that you're not in my world 
But the sad truth is you're just not my girl  

[Chorus  2X]
What's it gonna take for you to be with me girl
What's it gonna take to have you in my world
What's it gonna take for you to be with me boy
What's it gonna take to have you in my world

[Bigga Nolte]
She was a brown skin, thorough and attractive
Attractive, young thing I knew I liked her status
From way back, Mami had it like that
I always liked her but I had to hold back
It's the first time I hesitated
Baby girl was extra fine man and that's no exaggeration
The truth is I don't wanna be mistaken
But the way her body was shaking she had to be Jamaican 
And I love my brownin'
So baby girl let me tell you somethin'
The way that you move you got me groovin'
If it's wife that I need, it's you I'm choosing
I know I want you so I gotta make a stand
You say you gotta man, well I gotta plan
To win you over, take the thrown, make you mine
Then I'll hold you, take you home, watch you shine

[Chorus  2X]
What's it gonna take for you to be with me girl
What's it gonna take to have you in my world
What's it gonna take for you to be with me boy
What's it gonna take to have you in my world

[Young Mav]
Could you be loved by a dude like me
Skinny as I might be, cute as I might be
My bad, did I make you laugh
I'm no stranger, you can call me Mav
Enough about me, let's talk about you
You work full time or go to school
Firm like Fox, from a Kanye workout
My bad, was that out loud
Lames spit game, I let my words sail
Leave it to chance and prep no details
Bet you wonder is this dude for real
Stop thinking, react off how you feel
PYT, with a Habisha waistline
Say yes, and I promise I'll take time
Apple Bs suit a walk so mean
Back so plump, that she stretch the jeans

[Chorus  2X]
What's it gonna take for you to be with me girl
What's it gonna take to have you in my world
What's it gonna take for you to be with me boy
What's it gonna take to have you in my world</pre>
