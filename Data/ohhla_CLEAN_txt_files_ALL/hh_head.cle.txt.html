[Verse 1: D-Ray]
I do this 'cuz I love it, the slam of the drum kit
The hands at the jams from the fans in the public
I do it unemployed, enjoying what they're giving me
A man that's still a boy and to avoid responsibility
I do it for attention, and when they say I'm good
I'm representing more than just my city or my neighbourhood
It's for experience it isn't the wealth
And if I ever thought of quitting I'd be kidding myself
I do it for the people that I meet when I travel who
Notice the promotion from the sticker on the avenue
I do it because I stay committed like the tattoo
It's 'cuz I want to, I need to, I have to
I do it for the etiquette of heads that are getting it
To record the present and later on remember it
(Why) because it gets me high like drugs
I do it for the ride, the vibe, the buzz
I do it for precision and the inner recognition
It's the fix of the addiction and the thrill of competition
(Listen) it's got a name of you asking
I do it for the pleasure, the pain, and the passion
I do it for my little brother Simon, so my rhyming
Inspires him to take over for me in my retirement
Hopefully he sees, it ain't only for the G's
You've gotta love the feeling of just rolling up your sleeves
I do this for devotion and I plan to keep it rolling
'Till I one day get a visit from my family in Poland
It's for a higher power, maybe up above
And in a way you could say I do it for the love

[Bridge: Cale Sampson &amp; D-Ray}
It's for the love y'all (it's for the love)
It's for the love y'all (yeah it's for the love)
For the love of hip hop ( it's for the love)
It's for the love y'all

"One Love" - Nas

[Chorus: Cale Sampson &amp; D-Ray]
And if your honey starts to whine, and there's money on the line
And all you wanna do is rhyme (You're a Hip Hop Head)
And if it hits you in the spirit, almost every time you hear it
And you listen for the lyrics (You're a Hip Hop Head)
And if you got the jones, to rap and write poems
And you feel it in your bones (You're a Hip Hop Head)
And if you're trying to make progress, and you're broke but regardless
You support the local artist (You're a Hip Hop Head)

[Verse 2: Cale Sampson]
Eh yo I do this, little thing called music
I choose it over everything
No need to prove it, I'm part of a movement
Influence bigger than you'd ever dream
And I've been doing it since I was a little puny kid
Improved a bit with every single tune I did
I grew with it 'till it consumed me
And you can ask anyone who ever knew me
How come I do this? "it's therapeutic!"
I just want you to understand what my mood is
And the truth is I'd be stupid
To deny how I feel 'cuz I can't refuse it
Even when I try I can't seem to lose it
Probably puke it if I couldn't speak
I'll do it 'till I die, they said I wouldn't reach
A level this high, some people shouldn't preach
I do it for the kids who look up to me
Even though when I go home, I've got nothing to eat
Gotta keep doing this for all the emcees
I've ever rhymed with who you'll never know
For the rush that I get at every show
Where I've touched someone's heart and they've let me know
I do 'cuz there's nothing else that compares to it
Do it for my friends who tell me they always knew it
Do it for my family who never doubted me
It means so much 'cuz I know they're proud of me
I do this 'cuz hip hop runs through my blood
This culture is one thing that I'll always love

[Chorus: Cale Sampson &amp; D-Ray]
And if your honey starts to whine, and there's money on the line
And all you wanna do is rhyme (You're a Hip Hop Head)
And if it hits you in the spirit, almost every time you hear it
And you listen for the lyrics (You're a Hip Hop Head)
And if you got the jones, to rap and write poems
And you feel it in your bones (You're a Hip Hop Head)
And if you're trying to make progress, and you're broke but regardless
You support the local artist (You're a Hip Hop Head)</pre>
