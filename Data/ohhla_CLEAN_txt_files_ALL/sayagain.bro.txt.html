And now with The Minstrel Show update, with your correspondent... Jennifer Duvall

How's everybody doing, this is Sean Don, you know me; Jennifer Duvall
I'm over here chilling with Little Brother right now
And it's feel good, you see us
I'm listening to The Minstrel Show (hahaha)
You ain't heard, it's the biggest colored show on earth

[Rapper Big Pooh]
I'm overweight, rap is fat to death
Obese when these beats catch wind of my breath
And yes, you ain't heard you still rocking with the best
I just saved y'all from taking a guess
Not jeans, my dear
You ain't worthy to breathe my air
Or stand tall in the pair I wear
Am I making it clear
As the best to lay his head 'round here
And no I'm not the heir apparent to whoever...

[Phonte]
They never could out hit us (hit us)
Tried to think fast but never could out wit us (wit us)
The only thing they could ever do was outfit us
When clothes fit strange
I'm playin' Rick James
"Fuck yo' couch nigga!"
I'm comin' out with a bang
Straight Tay, Pooh, and 9th with no middle man
Everybody at the label asking "will it bang?"
I say chill, 'just take a percocet or ritalin'
Now, let the people sing

[Hook]
10 G's a show
Whylin' out with pretty Tony and O
 (We make'em wanna say it again, yeah, we make'em wanna say it again)
Beats from Mr. Douthit
Fresh jeans, fresh clothes, and outfits (let me hear it)
 (We make'em wanna say it again, uhh yeah, we make'em wanna say it again)

[Phonte]
I got so many rhymes, many styles to go with
And my competition all the while be hoping
That I'll quit bringing the pain like Ibuprofen
I can't dog, can't you see that the crowd is open
I mean, mouths is open
Hands in the air, just so aroused and focused
This is a movement, nigga its bigger than showbiz
This is how I live it
I love hip hop, I just hate the niggaz in it

[Rapper Big Pooh]
It's like, I'm just another nigga rockin' the mic
That's way above average and take it however you like
However despite I'm left to write
'Till my forearms get all tight
And my fingers start cramping up
Pose ampin' up I'm standing, what
Y'all niggaz ain't man enough, chill
Agitating like dandruff
I ain't talking all tough, but them people keep saying...

[Hook]
Big trucks and wheels
Dominican broads that's cookin' my meals (right papito) one time
 (We make'em wanna say it again, yeah, we make'em wanna say it again) check it out
Niggaz copy my style
Big Dho walking down the aisle (sing it to them)
 ("She's your queeeeeeeen to beeeeee")
Yeah, we make'em wanna say it again...

[Rapper Big Pooh]
Ayo, they beggin' for a taste of it
Get a plate, grab a cup or something, my nigga stop frontin'
On a mission, dudes still hunting
So stay out my way, act like you want something

[Phonte]
Yo, my girl's a grown woman who ain't trynna get her eagle on
She'd rather be in bed gettin' her Keagel on
In and out, working the walls when the heat is on
Like Mary J. or Tweet is on, now sing along...

[Hook]
Fresh clothes and cribs
Gimme a salad pass 9th the ribs
 (We make'em wanna say it again, ooh we make'em wanna say it again) now bring it back
Getting what's finally mine
Sign of relief, 'cause we finally signed (I'm home niggaz)
 (We make'em wanna say it again, yeah, we make'em wanna say it again)

Say it one more time for that girl named Pam Gram or that some black chic chick
She got me saying damn, damn
 (You make me wanna say it again, you make me wanna say it)
Now say it one more time for my nigga named pretty Tony
That always come through it, the hoes that wanna know me (yeah)</pre>
