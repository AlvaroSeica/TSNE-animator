Song:   Watch it Crack
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Its the pack and we run the club
boppas move to the front
suckas move to the back
dj spin just watch it crack

hit the scene dey like o my god
ya boy look like hes been touched by god
all you hatas betta get on ya job
she noe you go dead why she on ma joc
she said its goin down like the name young joc
the team dey strapped, we ridin wit the wop
If the bop get top, we gone' have to get a mop
shea! shea! shea! shea!
heres a name case you niggas don't noe me
yung stunna man aka mc.foley (mc.foley)
she a fan why she alwayz wanna blow me(yup!)
say she love the pack but the girl don't even noe me(hey!)

Its the pack and we run the club
boppas move to the front
suckas move to the back
dj spin just watch it crack

l-dot-smith get it crackin
ryan broke out yea the pack made it happen
so my chik I need an all black magnum
then I hit her with the all gold magnum
I go so she cant say no
she said she wanna blow so I took her to the south pole
yea dats how ya boy move
shoot game real smooth
bapes on the feet, yea the kid too coo
wolf-pack boys get it rockin
only 4 niggas get the night club knockin(poppin)
see the beat gone' slap
you already noe its yung l on the track

Its the pack and we run the club
boppas move to the front
suckas move to the back
dj spin just watch it crack

girl already noe dat the click go skitz
so wayz on ma hand see the bread gone' season
vans on ma feet cuz I gotta walk easy
lil b, lil b, girl wanna see me
west berkley I bang ma turf
the only nigga in the hood wit a punk rock shirt
and the ladies say cute, I be fuckin a brawd
the only time we in the hood is wen we fixin the car
drinkin yeen wen ma eyes not focused
girl wit the braid, light skin, she sexy
walk to the right vip where I'm headed
all the go girls make the girls get naked

Its the pack and we run the club
boppas move to the front
suckas move to the back
dj spin just watch it crack (go! go! go!)
go! go! go! go! go! go! go! go! go! go! go! go! go! go! go! go!</pre>
