Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Chorus]
Lead me higher, Lead me higher
And lift my eyes up, to the Light when
I can see all the pain coming, to an end
Lead me higher, into Your fire
Burn away all of the desires
And let my heart, beat again

I feel myself rising high above my yesterdays
Yes it pays just to praise standing in your rays
Sun shining reminding me that you rose
Reminding me that I'm yours
And wrapped in righteous robes
Closer that I get to you the higher that I feel
It's like my spirits been lifted outside the stratosphere
When death is powerless and pain will never lay a claim
And all the world will proclaim, Your name forever reigns
Put desire inside of the fire in my bones
Earth groans to see Your return, take us Home
Solo for so long, I'm sold on. You on the Throne
My life no longer my own, lead me higher

[Chorus]

Uh, it's Friday morning, I'm up to early
I'm up to high, the sky below me
Like I'm sitting in a plain feeling strange can't explain
How I get to experience these things
Been to plenty cities spent pretty pennies and ate plenty, fo
Do a show, I come home and feel empty? No
It's never me, I'm glad to say I've been changed like presidential campaigns
Used to wake up in the morning pursuing the wrong things
Now I wake up in the morning pursuing the Lord's name
Take me higher than the highest You're my hope and my desire
Lifting me up high despite of this gravity lead me higher

[Chorus]</pre>
