Brakes on, please

[Verse One]
Brakes on, please
Focus, freez
Ain't no other bitch in this world dealer than me (uhn uhn)
C'mon, I got too much of a lead
And at your speed, it's hard to say you fuckin with me
Fall back and hit your head bitch or come up dead bitch
The war ain't over 'til I come up wit your head bitch
Came a long way, waited my turn, tempted to eat
Held my ground and my heat, on the strength of the street
Cos I had to win, battle niggaz left me staggerin
Unstoppable bitch, why sleep now when I haven't been
Label me the miss of this shit
I've never fell but that don't stop bitches from wishin as shit (shit)
Chevy made her
Without a doubt, a heavy weighter
And without a doubt, that's why they hate her
I cock and deliver
Cos I'm holdin at my spot and the leader
Want her, come and get her
I guess y'all bitches beta reconsider

[Chorus]
Brakes on, please
Focus, freez
Ain't no other bitch in this world dealer than me (uhn uhn)

The miss of this shit
You've been missin the shit
Position the hit
Ain't miss of a shit

(Repeat Chorus)

She the B-L-O-O-Dline bitch
Clear your mind bitch
Ain't no way you fuckin wit mine bitch

(Repeat Chorus)

Look skeezer
Take a breather, you lookin at the leader
Throw in the towel, y'all bitches will never beat her

[Verse Two]
Please take notice, stop breathe focus
You lookin at a bad bitch, your pack seem bogus
Rap is a competitive sport
If yo ain't got your mind right, your head'll get caught
I'm like a fuckin John niggaz, stop listen and learn niggaz
Spit vicious and burn niggaz, cremate and urn niggaz
Defeat my opponents yea hungry and eat my opponents
I like to take this time out to break thru the donuts
Came into this muthafucka wit my head straight
Came into this muthafucka beggin for a plate
Battle niggaz and bitches that bite mocks and stitches
They competitions get ditches
Damn it, the bitch is vicious
You can't beat her, you can't harm a eeva (hair of her)
Hunk ur brace bitch don't make me have to palm the heater
cos you can't get credit, you quit
That's how it get
Don't get big fucking with the realest bitch of the shit

[Chorus]
Brakes on, please
Focus freez
Ain't no other bitch in this world dealer than me (uhn uhn)

The miss of this shit
You've been missin the shit
Position the hit
Ain't miss of a shit

(Repeat Chorus)

She the B-L-O-O-Dline bitch
Clear your mind bitch
Ain't no way you fuckin with mine bitch

[Verse Three]
This is the last time I wanna have to tell you to focus freez
Bitch it hopeless you're not in my lead
My shoes don't fit, you sorry, you can't be me
I'm the realest bitch in this world, can't you see?
Cos you can't, you hoes just hate to admit it
The truth hurts, that's why y'all hoes hate when I spit it
But I'm the chiefrunner of this shit
stay in your place
Please step on your brakes 'fore I step on your face
See they wanna catch me sleepin and step in my space
Hold the plots up in 'em, all I got is venom
Think you got some chicks in your team, hoch the ?????
I was born with the shin in my jeans not my denim
You can wait stop thinkin bullshit thoughts
Tryna score, you ain't fontin on the bullshit courts
You gon' never find a bitch to get a heat to the street
(cos ain't no other bitch in this world dealer than me)

[Chorus]
Brakes on, please
Focus, freez
Ain't no other bitch in this world dealer than me


The miss of this shit
You've been missin the shit
Position the hit
Ain't miss of a shit

(Repeat Chorus)

She the B-L-O-O-Dline bitch
Clear your mind bitch
Ain't no way you fuckin with mine bitch

(Repeat Chorus)

Look skeezer
Take a breather, you lookin at the leader
Throw in the towel, y'all bitches will never beat her
