[Chorus: Selau] - 2X
Fancy bet I'm from these streets
Come holla no metter what at you
So tell me what you gonna do-gonna do
When my nigga Mess come for you

(*Talking over chorus*)
What you gon do nigga
Come on my nigga, what you gon do
Nigga shitter get off the shitter, mayne
KnowI'mTalkinBout, yeah

[MessCalen]
When I go to the club, I don't need I.D.
Me and my niggaz walk straight to the V.I.P.
I need twelve bottles of that Grey Goose Vodka
I don't want you bitch, I wanna fuck ya potna
I'm a gangsta ass nigga, hoes call me a dog
I'm havin money motherfucker, I'ma floss and ball
The only nigga in the party with a Uzi baby
Pardon me miss, excuse me baby
But your boy smoke weed like Cypress Hill
I'm on dope nigga and about four of them good pills
With a few of my men, five hundred in the lot
Lil' niggaz on the turf, with Ben &amp; Jerry's on the spot
Mess spend money like it's runnin out of style
Hit King Kays and drink all the Crystal
It's about thirty thousand in the club with me
I'm from the streets, these my niggaz, they dont fuck with me
for real

[Chorus: Selau] - 2X

[Verse 2]
They see me when I pull and jump out the five
Like after all that shit, that lil' nigga still alive
Shit, I'm from the eighty's, I'm a dinosaur
And I'm into beef nigga, I'm a carnivore
I'm a made motherfucker, I don't tuck my ice
I flirt with death lil' nigga this my life
Preach told me never let the money make you nervous
If you scared motherfucker go to Sunday Service
I got rid of the Scraper and sold the Lex
Got like eleven mo' rifles and ten mo' tecs
Just opened the duffle that I staff from 9-8
Blue bottle blocka make sure mine's eight
I run a machine, y'all on that new shit
I'm with that Crip and that Blood and that red and that blue shit
Bout three in the mornin with no bodyguards with me
I'm from the streets, these my niggaz, they don't fuck with me
for real

[Chorus: Selau] - 2X

(*Talking*)
Huh, huh, hahaha
I been sayin though man, you niggaz see me, man
Pullin up to the liquor store bouncin out somethin exotic
Man, real colorful, real colorful though around the neck
and around the wrist, uh-huh uh-huh
It's me red bone bitch in the passenger seat
I got that heat man, but these is my niggaz
Richmond, Vallejo, Sacramento, Oakland
San Jose, San Francisco, nigga I am the Bay, I am in

[Chorus: Selau] - 4X</pre>
