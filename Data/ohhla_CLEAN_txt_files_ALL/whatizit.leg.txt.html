[Intro - Bicasso]
We ain't banging we just maintaining
This one goes out to all the booty clappers
The titty shakers, no mood fakers
Party people in the dance, here's your chance

[Chorus]
Well it really wasn't nothing but a little something to say
Something to play something for you
Something that you're listening to
SO wait a minute why you wanna keep it up right now
Well said it really wasn't nothing but a little something to say
Something to play something for you
Something that you're listening to
So gone get it if you wanna keep it up, true, true, true

[Grouch]
Something to bump, something to get the night started
Clean your house to it mood's all light hearted
I like art with a little bit of thought to it
I love thoughts when I spit them in your pop music, huh
That's my weapon of choice, turn the CNN off I got a more familiar voice
For sure you feel it hoist them hands in the sky
Ladies shake it show that man why you fly
I span any gap between funks we don't need them
I love the way I live it but I don't force feed them for sport
I beat them to the spot Josh freed them (come on you'll)
Show them how we come and if not then keep drumming
I peeped someone smiling to the funk now that feels nice
I'm a sucka for a smile and I still might
But if I don't, don't take it as a dis baby
I'm in character or maybe it's that I'm just lazy

[Chorus]
Well it really wasn't nothing but a little something to say
Something to play something for you
Something that you're listening to
SO wait a minute why you wanna keep it up right now
Well said it really wasn't nothing but a little something to say
(Whatizit) something to play something for you
(Whatizit) something that you're listening to
So gone get it if you wanna keep it up, true, true, true

So well we ain't say that it's make believe
We start it right here's the truth
Make you do what you gots to do, and come on, come on
But if you ain't faking you best believe
We making these just for you
In the parking lot get the groove, and it's on, it's on

[Bicasso]
Look somebody said it Be-Eye-See up in the dance hall
Keeping it moving feel the grooving so you stand strong
This for my people you the sequel second dance you'll
Brothers and sistas either you with us or you're damn wrong
That ain't right not here to fight
We here to party so your hands on holding your drinks they might
Keep it flowing til the jams gone right
Shaking your ass to music freakin with their pants on tight
Touching the floor feeling for more let's make it last all
Now that we in it go on and get it all night
Feeling the perk making a habit putting in work hand clapping
You never know nothing for sure live it up
Bicasso like I said and man I'm all up in the cut
Filling my cup and now I gotta give it up
Â‘Cause I got the party people like whaaaaaat

[Chorus]
Well it really wasn't nothing but a little something to say
Something to play something for you
Something that you're listening to
SO wait a minute why you wanna keep it up right now
Well said it really wasn't nothing but a little something to say
Something to play something for you
Something that you're listening to
So gone get it if you wanna keep it up, true, true, true

[Grouch &amp; Bicasso]
Well if you hear them you can find that one thing that you're hunting
What you ask for, you can have it

[Grouch]
Well now you get it I got it go on and now that I'm all straight
Independent world wide fuck Allstate
Give me all the cake bitch it's my birthday
I don't care what Fifty told you
I'm gonna trip like it's first grade
I guess everyone's invited
But I'll shut the party down if I so much as feel like it
Punch we'll spike it and my drunk ass get psychic
You got some weed then light it

(Yeah) so well we ain't say that it's make believe
(Well that's right) what's wrong or right here's the truth
(Uhhh) make you do what you gots to do (uh-huh) and come on (well) come on

[Chorus]
Well it really wasn't nothing but a little something to say
Something to play something for you
Something that you're listening to
SO wait a minute why you wanna keep it up right now
Well said it really wasn't nothing but a little something to say
Something to play something for you
Something that you're listening to
So gone get it if you wanna keep it up, true, true, true

[Bicasso]
Gangster Good here, riding through your hood on jelly bellies
Understand, stained glass windows man, huh-huh
It ain't nothing but the funk going on inside
Check it out, say what, say what
(Whatizit) and just in case you was wondering
(Whatizit) it really ain't nothing man
Just a little something I'm saying
Something for you to play, something for you hey
Something for you to listen to while you riding
Gangster Good here, Gangster Good, well</pre>
