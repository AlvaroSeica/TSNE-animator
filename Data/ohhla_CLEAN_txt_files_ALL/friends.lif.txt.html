Let me tell you 'bout this nigga named Franz, he had lots of plans
Involving pots and pans, with fiends for fans
He was a real mean one, traded all his niggaz in for a green thumb
Pose able, all weight was unloadable, despite his deformity all guns are hold able
Had his boys on some soldier role
They were risking they lives saying they actions are notable,
Torn apart for a purple heart
This brother had a strong start, but the kid lack street smarts

Hey meet James, he works at Ames to get a discount on M&amp;M's video games
He said his co-workers were lames, without brains
Cause he had struck a couple those for which he had aimed
This nigga used to buy grams from Franz uptown
Before he was buck bounced, connection is fucked now

Six years pass and he's still there, helping this old lady with the mean stare
Shopping in a wheel chair, her name was Claire
But she changed it to Greta, to help avoid a stalker with a vendetta
The cat sent her ten letters, saying she was a hat to be backed in leather
And very soon in her living room he met her
Well dressed nightmare in a cashmere sweater
Blue Collar guy with some death in his eye
The tattoo was sitting high, right leg and her thigh
He just wanna see how you respond
when he give thrust to a knife from his powerful arm

And finally police chief officer brief
who received a phone call from the nearly deceased
He lost his gentle side at the homicide attempt
See now every single thought of murder is tempting
He couldn't ask for a bigger day
the following week he spent his time staring at exhibit A
A bloody knife that bore flesh and bone marrow
And just before he headed home to his wife Carroll
Reported suicide on the other side of town
Frantic mother claims little girl had fallen down
He's on the scene seeing paramedics on the ground
Mom and daddy can't move the boy hiding in his room and
His fellow officers are all trying to subdue her
Head shake in disbelief saying he ain't human
Next time assuming that the media excluded
Displayed on the (?)

Your spirit's absorbed in generators and tanks, data banks
You're retracing your steps and drew blanks
Look at all these lives to waste, it's a dark space
Adrenaline starts to pump increasing your heart rate
You're caught now, imagination has gone wild
You look into the mirror and then you tell me 'who art thou'
You got to be determined like (?) when he fought (?)
You're brains been bust open cause this is a hard trial
No answer just a mental cancer, before you choke I hope you get a chance to
Feel fear, cause this is a real scare
I'm giving you three seconds to tell us how we got here</pre>
