Yeah, uh, what, uh, yeah, uh
Aiyyo you can hit the dance floor now, you ain't gotta wait
We can take this outside, you ain't gotta hate
This here is a family affair, the family is here
Everybody put your hands in the air
And we don't need no hateration
Somebody better calm duke down cause the eight'll lace him
So while you're waitin get it perculatin
Love to smoke preferably purple haze and, sharp as a buck fifty
Doin my dance, and honey mad cause she can't keep up with me
But I'm still bangin 'em, soggin 'em, still robbin 'em
And the whole world know 'Kiss is a problem
But I ain't come to fight, I came to have fun tonight
and hit more then one tonight
Get it crunk from beginnin to end
Mary J. and Jada, Y.O., we did it again, uhh

[Mary J. Blige]
Come on everybody get on up
Cause you know we gots to get it crunk
Mary J. is in the spot tonight
And I'ma make you feel alright (make you feel alright)
Come on baby just party with me
Let loose and set your body free
Leave your situations at the do'
So when you step inside jump on the floor
 
[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Let's get it crunk up on it, fun up on it, in this dancery
We got y'all open, now your floatin, so you gots to dance for me
Don't need no hateration, holleration, in this dancery
Let's get it perculatin, while you're waitin, soldiers dance for me
 
[Mary J. Blige]
It's only gonna be about a matter of time
before you get loose and start to lose your mind
Cop you a drink, go ahead and rock your ice
Cause were celebratin no more drama in our life
Get the great track pumpin, everybody's jumpin
Go ahead twist your back and get your body bumpin
I thought I told you to leave your situations at the door
So grab somebody and get your ass on the dance floor

[Chorus]
 
[Fabolous]
Yall can't deny it, uh, yeah, this is cracklatin
Yeah it's Mary and the kid
Bouncing in the six four until we crack the Dayton's
After a few shots I'm faded
family affair, yall don't where the spot is located if your not related
and they got to hate it
ha switch from a ring to chapar to a rolex
I watch them grin it
this year there is no more drama 
mainly because now my saving account show more commas
usally it's mellow rappers
in the club pulling models and pulling bottles out them yellow wrappers
saying r&amp;b to those hammers
and be standing on the couch like my moms ain't teach me no manners
ma we can leave the club and hit the beach in Guyana
don't come back to our features is tanner
and thiers acscents on each of our grammers
your with the young F-A-B-O-L-O-U-S family

[Chorus] - repeat until end</pre>
