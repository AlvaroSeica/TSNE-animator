Listen

Girl you can be my super goal
And you lookin stupid cool in that dress that you wore with the high-tops on
Pretty impressed cause I rolled in the Maybach
But... maybe we should skate sometime
Or go up on a date sometime
Cause whatever you want we could shop for it now
At the bottom we can go up to the top for New
York City... we just chillin on the top floor gold
IPhone and I'm hopin that you got yours
Cause baby you're my pretious
Said you wanna surf... we could go and get some lessons
Take you to Hawaii... call villain, get some sessions
And that's the clique, no question
Don't do well with first impressions... I'm the freshest
I opened up like all your presents
Girl this is a life so just come and join this essence
Slip those dresses in your bag

We can chase the sunset
Stare into the moonlight
Let's dream of a love
That lights up the sky

We can chase the sunset
Wake up to the moonlight
As long as you're here
I can stare in your eyes

As I'm looking through a peephole
Girl I'm like a movie and I'm waiting for my sequel
And it's you and... please don't listen to these other people
Cause all they do is hate but they say that love is evil and it's true
And you're not one of them girls that I see up at the school
You the girl at the party wearing c-thru in the pool
And I like you living life up on the edge
Be hanging in the light till there's some life up in this bed
If you aiming all those shirts that you be wearing they'd be scaring me
It's feeling like you touch em and you scare em but apparently these jockers just don't care
And everybody there was starin
G! you just kept on laughing, living life like it's a parody
But I'm bout to kill them
Give it to em all, rockin shorts in the summer, rocking Denim in the fall
And I'm a roll up with my friends in the Benz when you call
Cause we're chilling in your Beemer but the fans wanna ball
Misfits
Rep

We can chase the sunset
Stare into the moonlight
Let's dream of a love
That lights up the sky

We can chase the sunset
Wake up to the moonlight
As long as you're here
I can stare in your eyes

We can chase the sunset
Stare into the moonlight
Let's dream of a love
That lights up the sky

We can chase the sunset
Wake up to the moonlight
As long as you're here
I can stare in your eyes

Love is like a fairytale that's very well written
Soft lips
Scary thrill if I ever be forgiven from this
Fresh love... cause fresh love is the best love
The type of love where you can't even imagine your next love if there is one
There must be something you like at this age
All fun and games til the kids come
But baby what's your wish?
Ever since I first kissed, my mom's been dreaming a wish
We're together now
I don't care who you been with
This love isn't a myth
So come and chase the sun and in my heart you'll always live
And just know I'll always tell you what it is

We can chase the sunset
Stare into the moonlight
Let's dream of a love
That lights up the sky

We can chase the sunset
Wake up to the moonlight
As long as you're here
I can stare in your eyes
