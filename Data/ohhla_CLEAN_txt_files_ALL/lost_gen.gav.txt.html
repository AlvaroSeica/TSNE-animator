[Chorus]
When you're doing wrong, man it's hard to make it right
And when you're in the dark, man it's hard to see the light
You gotta preserver
You gotta preserver
When you're tryna grind, man you gotta take your time
And when you're writing lines, gotta say what's on your mind
You gotta preserver
You gotta preserver

[1st Verse]
Tryna keep his cool, but he finna blow
'Cuz he feeling like Notorious kicked in the door
Never seen it before, 'cuz it's unorthodox
And he finna go, get up off his block
They think that he not, but he really will
'Cuz them shooters, shoot and them killers, kill
And ain't no sitting still, or he gonâ die in vein
'Cuz it's either he gonna grow, or he gonâ stay the same
Searching for the finer things, through the tougher times
And it's 'cuz of the pain, that got him spitting lines
He think that it's time to make a bigger move
Let the haters hate, while they watch him cruise
Cool

[Chorus]
When you're doing wrong, man it's hard to make it right
And when you're in the dark, man it's hard to see the light
You gotta preserver
You gotta preserver
When you're tryna grind, man you gotta take your time
And when you're writing lines, gotta say what's on your mind
You gotta preserver
You gotta preserver

[2nd Verse]
Laying low but he ain't hiding. Just tryna get his mind right
Picking his battles, but he ain't really tryna fight
Grew up as a victim of the circumstance
Once considered a loser, but tryna make improvements
Can't tell him what to do, but they advised him
That his wisdom could brighten his horizons
Yet he blinded by the negatives
And young goons that gangbang and let barretas spit
And young girls that only see him as a specimen
His heart cold, so it's easy to let the devil in
What to do when his backs against the wall and he tryna dodge the fall?
And he tryna stay the same, but don't wanna leave the game

[Chorus]
When you're doing wrong, man it's hard to make it right
And when you're in the dark, man it's hard to see the light
You gotta preserver
You gotta preserver
When you're tryna grind, man you gotta take your time
And when you're writing lines, gotta say what's on your mind
You gotta preserver
You gotta preserver

[3rd Verse]
He can't taste success, unless he work for it
And sacrifice the pain and the hurt for it
Reminiscing about the nights that he stayed up
Hours of plotting to get his pay up
Can't take a pay cut, especially when you're living on the day to day
And he tryna dodge the law just to play it safe
And he searching for the end so he could make a mean
But it's hard to stay clean when you in the streets
And it's hard to stay chill, when they on your back
And if he turn to violence, it ainât no coming back
Theyâll probably catch him on the block while he selling rock
So they can throw him in a box and watch him rot. Damn.

[Chorus]
When you're doing wrong, man it's hard to make it right
And when you're in the dark, man it's hard to see the light
You gotta preserver
You gotta preserver
When you're tryna grind, man you gotta take your time
And when you're writing lines, gotta say what's on your mind
You gotta preserver
You gotta preserver</pre>
