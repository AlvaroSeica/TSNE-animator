[Naomi]
Ours was a true Hollywood love story

[Kail - singing]
You know I, still love you girl~!

[Kail]
'Member that party at Las Palmas? (HEY!)
I said, now that's gon' be my baby's momma (HEY!)
I rode up on it like the tires on a bike (HEY!)
Sorry momma, but you flyer than a kite (I know that's right!)
WHO DAT? Wit'cho fine behind
I was so sprung you ain't home, but I'm drivin by, always inside my mind
So nervous tryin to hit you up to wine and dine
From Micelli's to the delis, pardon like it's 1999
Naomi I love you (I love you too!) You love me? (I love you fool!)
(I know that you're the one for me) I'll always be in love with you

[Kail - singing]
You will always be, the love on my miiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiind~!
So what's the problem?
See girl I want you so bad
That I demand you to call
If I can't have you right now
Then I don't want it at all
See when you're distant so long
That seems to make us untrue
We pushed each other so far
We don't know what to do

[Kail]
Naomi, tell me who you fuckin fool (Tell me who you fucking too!)
(Know what? Fuck this shit) Hey, then I ain't tryin to fuck wit you
My crazy shady lady (Just call me when you get the phone bill money)
(for the month) What? (FUCK YOU, PAY ME!)

[Interlude]
But a love that has created so much life between two souls
Can't just die out at the first sign of heartbreak
You know if we didn't kill it we only made it stronger

[Kail]
Okay, so what now?
I miss you (I miss you too)
You missed me?! (I missed you fool!)
(Missin you since day one) I'm so tired of missin you

[Kail - singing]
You have always been, the love on my miiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiind~!

[Naomi]
Baby, I gotta finish nursing school
And your ass is talkin 'bout goin to Europe?

[Kail]
Yeah, I know that, but
I mean even if we're still homies you know it's still cold in Kail baby
That's hard sex!

So now we'll make it tight, whatever
And meanwhile if I'm senile I won't forget ya, no ties are severed
We'll make our lives better before life together
Get right with cheddar, get right with set-ups, get right whatever
Even if a new love applies the pressure
I'll know you taught me how to love, there'll be none like you never
I can't say that you'll be mine forever
Just listen for the I love you in all my rhymes and letters

[Kail - singing]
Cause you know I, you know I still love you girrrrrrrrrrrrl!
You know I, you know I still love you girrrrrrrrrrrl
Yeahhh hah ha hah hey hey!

[Naomi]
I love you too, shit!
