Orale

(Verse 1)
Orale pues, it's me, the L-I-L R-O-B
The wicked little vato with those wicked rhymes for S.D.
San Diego, Southern Califas man controlling shit
And all these people call me
A stupid ass spic
You call me a spic, I'll take you out, silly sucker
Cause you ain't nothin' but a stupid ass motherfucker (Stupid motherfucker)
Go ahead
And start your shit, start your pleito
But you'll find that you'll lose, when you fuck with San Diego
Now listen up to what I've got to say
I'm down for San Diego, and I'm down with L.A.
And sabes que, they're both down with me
And it's a trip, cause I got primos in every fuckin' city, man
I got more hard boys than you could ever imagine
To all you little shit
Talkin' putos, I'm not, havin'
About not
Being down, for the town
A crazy little vato fuckin' it up, for the
Brown
You see I'm down for the 619
Fools say I'm doing bad, but
I'm just doing fine, not givin' a fuck
About what you punks got to say
Cause I'm that crazy
Mexicano, down to fuckin' spray
You know what I'm saying, leva
And you know it's true
To win, someone's got to lose, and I never lose
So, uh
You know that I can't be that ranker
You want to know who the fuck I am?
I'm the Mexican gangster

(Verse 2)
Mexican Gangster, numero dos
Simon, I'm back once again
A little different since back, then
Four years later
Four years brighter
Back with some shit like yesca, takin' you higher
High
High
High
Like to the ceilin'
I can't fight the feelin'
If I had a million
Bucks, what would I do
I'd smoke up my yesca tree
I swear to God, ese, 'bout three times as tall as me
Oh man, what would I do without my, mija
What would I do when I'm all stress up, without mi grifa
I ain't jokin'
The homies don't call me Prankster
It's Lil' Rob A.K.A. Capone, Mexican Gangster

Orale

(Verse 3)
Got those beats that thump, that you bump
Because I know you likin' the bass that
Humps
Makin' you wonder where the hell I've been for four years
It's not because of fears, so
Let's just make that clear
Now, just
Hear what I say, when I say what I gotta say, man
Comin' at you quick that you don't even got time to pray
In the name of the Father
The Son
And the Holy Ghost
Man it's time to get, ghost
No time to watch these putos roast
Coastin' down the block
Fuckin' up these levas
I don't give a fuck
And I don't think I ever will
I kill for thrills, fat, bills is what I'm foldin'
Mexican Gangster 2, the title, is the title I'm holdin'
Scoldin' all these fools, simon, I'm controllin' my city
All these vatos wantin' pedo, when they know they can't hang with me
Shoot me, that's what you want to do, man
But if you shoot at me, you best believe that I'm gonna shoot you too, man
Going insane when I click
Click
Click
Cause I'm that crazy Hispanic
I'm the Mexican Gangster
