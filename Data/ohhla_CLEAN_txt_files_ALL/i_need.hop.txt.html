Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro]
I just, I just don't, I just, I just, I just don't know
I - I - I just, I just don't, I just, I just don't know what to do [x2]

[Verse 1]
I'm back nigga, what's up?
Hop, how'd you get your buzz up?
I heard you signed over your soul to the devil, is it true? Nigga shut the fuck up!
In my heart there ain't much love
So if you get best then that tough luck
FV doin' shit so bigheaded I'm on your side now nigga, fuck us!
It's Knock Madness! I'm back up in this
I'm a real nice nigga but I rap for vengeance
Only got bad intentions and I'm looking for a new mouth that my nutsack could fit in
I look like an idiot to grab attention
But my new fans tellin' me to trash my lenses
It's bad for business
I'm lacking senses
It feels like I'm trapped in a black dimension
Stepped in this bitch to wreck
So don't disrespect
I promise thatwould be a big regret
I'll twist ya' neck
I'm lookin' for a fish to catch
I chop niggas up, yeah I learned it from Tech
I got hoes all over me that wanna get me (dome)
They all yellin' Hopsin you turn me (on)
But I feel like it's the Devil tryna' to get me (whoa)
And I don't wanna do it cause it's me (home)
Nigga, I'm so cool, but I feel so low
See I got a crew, but I feel so low
I cruise, but the wheels don't roll
You feel what I'm sayin'? Shit neither do I
I'm a give you niggas one more album and after that it's peace out
And I'm leaving you guys, you know why?

[Chorus]
The world made feel like I lost myself
My own homies tellin' me that I need help
If you got a solution for me you should probably
Holla at cha boy if you know somebody
Let me know [x4]
Holla at cha boy if you know somebody
Let me know [x4]
Holla at cha boy if you know somebody

[Verse 2]
No no no no no no no no no NO!
Hopsin is doomed, locked in a room
Spaced out like I Love poppin a shroom
God lit a fuse
Now I gotta make a decision and I don't really know which option to choose
I'm a big wreck, did you not get the news?
I made a million bucks but did not get abused
How did I manage to get robbed from the truth
Maybe I shoulda never went and dropped outta at school
It's not that bad, you're okay kid, cheer up
But I got a life and that I ain't Too $hort
So I gotta dress like Ace Ventura
Can't look at myself I might break this mirror
(Shit! Fuck! Fuck!) I'm paranoid
I'm plannin' to go for every little scary noise
See, when I go pick up the phone and tell friends about it
But they won't answer cause they're annoyed
I'm like uggghh, I put a porno on cause my life ain't awesome, man
Jacked off, go to sleep, wake up, jacked off again
Then repeat the cycle
Can't go to sleep unless I leave the lights on
You don't know how many fuckin' demons I know
Maybe I should go and try to read the bible
(Fuck! Oh no) I don't even like rap, the only thing I wanted was to be cool
And hang out with a group of fans and solve mysteries like I'm Scooby Doo
But I got way more than I bargained for
You can't chill when your heart is soar
I'm so mad I could start a war
So fuck Hopsin, man I don't really know who I are no more!

[Chorus]
I feel like I lost myself
My own homies tellin' me that I need help
If you got a solution for me you should probably
Holla at cha boy if you know somebody
Let me know [x4]
Holla at cha boy if you know somebody
Let me know [x4]
Holla at cha boy if you know somebody

[Verse 3]
Man, ya'll niggas tryna' kill my vibe
Lately, don't nobody feel my rhymes
Dizzy goin' up tryna' steal my shine
I'm all outta ammo, my skills just died
But "Oh my God, I love Ill Mind 5!"
Do what I want, bum skippity bums get high
That will change my whole entire life
You make more things like that? I'll buy!
Well I got news for you, my screws are loose (I'll tell ya)
This rap thing here's what I use to do, now I'm movin' to (Australia)
When I go ghost I'm a get a house on the gold coast yelling YOLO
On a couch, feelin' so dope, livin' low pro, so these foul niggas
Don't know I'll be strutting around like (hell yeah!)
Man, I'm losin my mind, ya'll assume that I'm cool when I rhyme
See I'm tryin' to be Marcus and Hopsin but I get depressed when the two intertwine
Truthfully, I'm not the man that I used to be
Nobody cares who I used to be
To talk to, so I lose to heat
I cut bad and the bruise is deep
There isn't anything you can do for me

[Chorus]
The world made feel like I lost myself
My own homies tellin' me that I need help
If you got a solution for me you should probably
Holla at cha boy if you know somebody
Let me know [x4]
Holla at cha boy if you know somebody
Let me know [x4]
Holla at cha boy if you know somebody</pre>
