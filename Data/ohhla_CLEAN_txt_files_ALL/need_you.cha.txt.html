Cha-Cha-Chiki-Chi-Cha-Cha
Ah girl
Cha-Cha-Chiki-Chi-Cha-Cha, uh-huh
Its the C to the H-A, C-H-A
On the freeway speeding in the CLK
Got a party out in Cali on the second and third
House of blues bad news from the second we merge
I take it you heard, getting at me till the second we splurge
On my nerves, purve from lie
Peeping curves and bottles
You fellas is hot trying to get a rise and why
They eyeing Cha
These broads aint understanding why, they like

I need you
Cha-Cha-Cha-Cha
Thats what I want
Cha-Cha-Chiki-Chi-Cha-Cha
Cha-Cha-Chiki-Chi-Cha-Cha, uh-huh

Cha-Cha-Chiki-Chi-Cha-Cha
Ah girl
Cha-Cha-Chiki-Chi-Cha-Cha, uh-huh

Ladies Imma tell yall something
Cha aint the one for confronting
Cause all that name calling aint gonna leave yall with nothing
Hard to comprehend, then you must dont understand
Pardon me when you need to talk to your man
Im on the road too much
To hear that he saying, she say
Niggas playa hating trying to catch me up on three way
I tried to give him leeway, but he aint wanna to see that
Told him put down the crying, he didnt even wanna do that
Believe that in concerns where confessions is at
Dont get mad baby boy I just addressing the facts
Lesser than that, get sent to where my sessions is at
See yall the match and with me is where he got too attach
A thorough bread turn heads
So you better be careful who you spitz at
Cause if she like me
You aint never gonna get theses gifts back
Theyre tame and I cant help the way they clutch to me and lust for me
They like she too much for me

I need you
Cha-Cha-Cha-Cha
Thats what I want
Cha-Cha-Chiki-Chi-Cha-Cha
Cha-Cha-Chi-Cha-Cha
I want you
Cha-Cha-Cha-Cha
Thats what I want
Cha-Cha-Chiki-Chi-Cha-Cha
Ah girl
Cha-Cha-Chiki-Chi-Cha-Cha

She baby boy yous just a gym shoe nigga
I spent you nigga
Only time I call is when I rent you nigga
Broad thing aint really nothing against you nigga
And the small things is really why Im with you nigga
And its worse I aint got the kind of time you thirst
I dont curse but any minute Imma let one burst
Know how much one broad get if she spit one verse
So we sit and converse, let em know these hits come first
Used to chickens sitting around smoking drough with you
What I look like a wife getting blown with you?
And pulling hair, feet bare, fighting over you
Playing on other chicks phones like Im told they do
Im a broad I dont key you like them  do
Peeps handle how they supposed to, put holes in you
Its respect and I cant help it if they cheat on you, be leaving you
Peep the hook and yo believe me boo
