[Verse 1]
I wanna go back like ageing rock stars
Reverse it all like we chase these cop cars
Whole damn street was an underage entourage
They loved pop charts, I listened to Poppa Large
They would bombard in our a rock hard stomping yard
Nothing in the way of the Malabar promenade
Give each other shit, boy I would cop it hard
Somewhere the seriousness and innocence crossed paths
I got stuck starin at the lost stars
Mind adrift thinkin that it's not far
And it's not, and wasn't at all
I was in such a rush for my first pub-crawl, come on

[Hook]
What? My number 45 stays with me through all walks of life
Home in time to watch the morning rise
Once the innocence died, it was fallin skies
We keep fallin but we rise
Keep fallin but we rise, but we rise
Yep, until the day I die
Stays with me through all walks of life, 45
