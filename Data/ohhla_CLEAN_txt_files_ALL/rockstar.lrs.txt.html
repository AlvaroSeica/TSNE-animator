[RADIO DJ] 106.3 The best in modern alternative
We've got laptop rapper MC Lars
Lars how does it feel to be a rock star?
[LARS] Well, I'm glad people like my songs, it's just that I still...

Sleep on people's floors (what)
Lose money on tours (what)
Owe my parents dough (yo)
My tummy's got to go (oh)
CD at HMV (but)
They hate me on AP (what?)
Admit it Bush screwed up (what!)
So Toby Keith, shut up.

[CHORUS]
Now who's that rock star?
L-A-R-S!
Now who's that rock star?
L-A-R-S!

On your stereo, pumping on your stereo
Everybody here we go with my punk rock mc flow
On your stereo, pumping on your stereo
Everybody here we go, with that Â– (and yo)

I hate your boyfriend's band (right)
Let's run off to Japan (tight)
My life's a bivouac (what?)
Hip-hip Kerouac (what!)
Punk rock drum and bass (right)
All up in your face (tight)
21 years old (yo!)
Thank God they broke the mold!

[REPEAT CHORUS]

I don't breakdance very well, but I thought that you could tell
Crazy props to Melle Mel, hey DMC I'm "Raising Hell"
I hit my mark like William Tell, I'm the kid they can't expel
Tim O'Toole fell down the well, compose my rap beats on a Dell

Crazy props to Melle Mel, hey DMC I'm "Raising Hell"
I hit my mark like William Tell, I'm the kid they can't expel
Tim O'Toole fell down the well, compose my rap beats on a Dell dude!</pre>
