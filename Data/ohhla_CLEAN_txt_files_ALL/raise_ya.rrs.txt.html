Song:   Raise Ya Glass Up
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

"Raise ya glasses up one time" for this hip-hop
A place where we can shittalk
It's not the point to keep your lips locked
The sweet meets the heatseak, leavin your knees weak
A clean sweep for when the wheels of steel go squeak squeak

"Raise ya glasses up one time" for watering holes
The places we go, with buddies and bros
Such as a distillery, of whiskey
Throw ya still frisky
The Amvillidie 34, you want more?

"Raise ya glasses up one time" for this shot
Immediate payback for the round that I just bought
But the real revenge will come to light in the A.M.
When your body shuts down for the hangover mayhem

"Raise ya glasses up one time" for live bands
The guy up on the stage with the guitar in his hand
For drummers and bass players as long as you got flavor
We gon' keep the people chillin with the illest behavior

"Raise ya glasses up one time" from Alberta
Higher chance you'll get murdered but more jobs than ya hearda
The grass is always greener here in Calgary you see that
we support THAT, from Medicine Hat to Fort Mack

"Raise ya glasses up one time" for the girls
who be sexy smart and sassy as they runnin the world
As they work in they careers, as they raisin they kids
As they doin what they doin when they handle they biz

"Raise ya glasses up one time" for the smokers
For the no choke tokers scratchy throat voice croakers
The dealers, the big willers, with ill scrillas
Who be always packin papers just to smoke a sensimilla

"Raise ya glasses up one time" for the Flames
Or hockey just in general, love the doubleheader games
Or raise a plastic cup for the cheapest spots
As we cheer Jarome Iginla, Miikka Kiprusoff

"Raise ya glasses up one time" for the ferry
And who with a {?} stand for the Audible Intelligence Crew
Or the one called Doomy, Q, SoLeo and Iron Lyon
City, Razor Sharp, {?}, Daddy, Wyze and {?} mesmerizin

"Raise ya glasses up one time" for the homies
For those who real know me, not those suckers actin phony
The ones who got my back through thick and thin
And it's the long haul I've gone through bump from start to finish

"Raise ya glasses up one time" for this bassline
We say how y'all doin? Y'all people supposed to say FINE~!
Whether you're on the floor or holdin up the wall
We gonna "raise ya glasses up one time" for alla y'all

"Raise ya glasses up one time" </pre>
