[Jay Jones]
She watch me hit that Danny now she all over my whammy
Her sister her cousin Danny got the whole family
They all on my Swagg, they all on my mojo
Watch me hit that Danny in these retros and this polo
You can shake your ass to this shit (bounce it)
gone get it bitch (bounce it) gone get it

Playa niggas get chose
traps stars get dough
when I hit that Danny I'ma take yo hoe

[Sherro]
You better do it, better do it
Do the Disco Danny; she got so much ass in them got damn panties
Slide to the left, so I can work my shoulders
Do the Disco Danny; cause the Dougie dance is over
Now throw it throw it back
Hands on the ground, now work that cat
Say what you gone do with all that back
I know it's fat, taste like a kit kat
But right now, back it up on the wall
and make that ass spin like a disco ball
If you need lessons, give me a call baby do it right
Baby girl don't fall. You better do it biiiiiitch!</pre>
