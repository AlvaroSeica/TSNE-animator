[Solo]
Don't push me cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head, a-ha-hah-hah-hah
Nothing in my pockets but an empty wallet and some house keys
and a fuck you for anyone who doubts me
As I walk the streets armed with the faith
that these boots will be enough to get me home in one piece
I exhale, breathe the air
Smoke trail got me thinking bout the reason I'm here
Cause I'm only nineteen but my mind is old
Sydneysider heatwave to Minnesota cold
Cold like the streets of the Cross where underages
litter the pavement, this ain't "Paradise", it's "Innocence Lost"
Cold like the veins of the junkies
Cold like the hearts of those who take their money
And I swear to God somebody died on my block the other night
A life lost to a domestic fight, and that shit ain't right
Now my picket fence don't look so white
I wonder what possesses a man to kill his wife?
And as if that wasn't enough
We got these fucking poker machines sucking the souls of our single mums
See I'm like Tim Friedman, I wish I could blow 'em up
For all the futures that they've ruined and the homes they've broken up
Now that's proof of a cold world, they package an addiction
and they sell it as a game, but anyway
Times are exponential, two-party preferential
And though it's incremental, day to day we making change
So here I am still trying to make this stone bleed
In the city of late trains and broken dreams
Where you rap with your talk, or you graff on the wall
You gotta something out of nothing at all

And yes, I built this house, I made it wrong
I watched it crumble, now I'm moving on
Now shit is rotten to the core, what a pity
We don't wanna be forgotten
That's why we write our stories on the walls of our cities
I'd write 'em all for you if I had the time
In forty-foot high letters cause they're important
It's enough of a challenge handling mine
Take it one day at a time
Treading water and crossing borders

Next to me a baby's crying for his mum as the ground's leaving
Economy class with chaos all around me
But I don't even care, I'm not even there
Frozen in a blank stare with my headphones blaring like
Don't push me cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head, a-ha-hah-hah-hah
Nothing in my pockets but a boarding pass and a passport
Plus an "I love you" for the friends I never asked for
It keeps me safe, guards me from the sickness
Like a pocketful of posie as I walk with the wicked
Talk with a quickness, never let 'em catch up
They wouldn't play with you if they could see the odds was stacked up
So you pack it up, move it town to town
Gotta study how the local village people get down
Riding through the night on a tube train
Having revelations bout my place in the food chain
Looking out the window at the world whizzing by
I'm determined to do something with my given time
And to begin with I'ma fit it in a rhyme
Watch us plant this forest one seed at a time
So shit, I spend my days hoping but by the same token
We here to get our chains broken and our names spoken

So this is my dot on the map, my drop in the ocean
My patch of dirt, and I'm make something
Make something work, make something feel
Make something hurt to make something real
Make something out of me, make a friend out of you
Then again, make an enemy if need be
So just let me be, let me rest, let me sleep
Let me wake, let me eat, let me grow, be at peace
Let your guard down, let me close
I'll let you see, let you know
Let you near, draw you in
Let you hear, show you things
I'ma let you in
Said I'ma let you in
Said I'ma let you in
Horrorshow two-double-oh-nine
One time for your mind
Said I'ma let you in
We bout to take you inside</pre>
