[chorus: fiend]
I gotta mis-tress bitch wit big tits (please believe dat)
and da hoes on da corner making me rich (please believe dat)&gt;
all the haters in the town tryin to down me (please believe dat)
but this pimpin goes on so nigga crown me (please believe dat)

[verse 1: juicy "J"]
you can call me juicy gigalo, you can call me doctor hoe
long as you got my dough, when I hit da corner stroll
everybody say they pimpin, claimin they got 2, 3 women
matchin on a big ass hill, wit a pool to take ya swimmin
stupid bitch you know that's game, can't you tell his pimpin lame
why he never took you there, why he keep on sellin you drames
fly you all across the state, where the cash or where's the cake
mayne you's just a groupie hoe all the men you say you break
but I can't tell (say what), I can't fail (i hear ya)
I gots to get all my fuckin mail (yeah)
so set this boy up take him to a room
tell him you got pussy comin through from "The Blue Lagoon"
then we gonna kick in da doe's, wit da 4-4's
make his eyes buck make him scream oh no!
put da hoe back on da corner take some no doze!
make her stay up all night and brang back my cheese or we gon fight bitch!

[chorus x2: fiend]
I gotta mis-tress bitch wit big tits (please believe dat)
and da hoes on da corner making me rich (please believe dat)
all the haters in the town tryin to down me (please believe dat)
but this pimpin goes on so nigga crown me (please believe dat)

[verse 2: fiend]
yeah, what you know about
seventy wanches, bunnies gettin money
askin fiend daddy, "Is This What Ya Want From Me?" yeah
got moves for 2's, pay em fo' you slay em
cuz I worked so hard just to tame em
scalp that mouth, observe them curves, admit them tits
watch her switch, you'd thank she was made from a bad bitch, kick
all jones fore she met me she was crawlin homeless
now ain't too much that baby girl consider roamless
dibble-dabble, like to be saddled and called "Mami"
and could give you a look like "Playa, Ooh I'm Climbin"
she fresh off good up in the hood
and she do up dat would just like she should and she could
love thugs on rims and fuck my friends
ain't nothin new to him won't touch her slim
american cheese or cheddar, she a veteran of sexual pleasure
in all leather at ya doe' like whatever and she got it

[chorus x2: fiend]
I gotta mis-tress bitch wit big tits (please believe dat)
and da hoes on da corner making me rich (please believe dat)
all the haters in the town tryin to down me (please believe dat)
but this pimpin goes on so nigga crown me (please believe dat)

[verse 3: dj paul]
I tell you what I'm a keep pimpin these hoes across da nation
while you lazy niggaz sittin back, waitin on reparation
i'm at da crib, I got 2 g's on the way: my hoe through
you at yo mama house waitin On "Cartoon, Cartoons"
but you's a dang fool, nigga though!
while you got pussy on yo gold, I'm out here sellin these hoes
I got some girls on the platinum plus you better believe
I got some girls at cristies, I keep some shit up my sleeve
I breath the con-yac, breath of my brother da late "Ben-Zo"
transfered da pimpin to me, as a momento
I pop a mento and spit pimpin ever so clear
you ask me where I stay, I tell you in a "Hoe's Ear"
I slam da h-2 to da curb with extra seat in back
it's primetime, so we gon stack on this right here track
it's goin down like I knew it would
we gon keep on makin money cuz this honey is good, ya hear me!

[chorus x2: fiend]
I gotta mis-tress bitch wit big tits (please believe dat)
and da hoes on da corner making me rich (please believe dat)
all the haters in the town tryin to down me (please believe dat)
but this pimpin goes on so nigga crown me (please believe dat)</pre>
