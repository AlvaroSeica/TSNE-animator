[Intro: Meek Mill] + (DJ Drama)
Okay, these niggas wanna be sleek?
It's nine in the morning, I ain't been asleep YET!
I though sleep was for billionaires
I think I'm the last of the street niggas left
(I like that!) Uhh... {"GANGSTA, GRIZZLES!!"}
(We good!)

[Meek Mill]
When it come to stuntin', I'm like money man Meech
Brought my city with me and we comin' in the fleet
And now I'm gettin' richer and they don't want me in the streets
I'm thinkin' fuck a album sales, we sold a hundred bricks this week
Thousand grams of crack, take it to the table
Bag it all up, take it to the label
and tell 'em distribute it, I'm gettin' cake ridiculous
'Rari like a frog, jumpin' through the traffic, ribbitin'
And they tellin' me to turn down, they say that I need Ritalin
Ballin' like I'm Jordan, no assists from Scottie Pippen
And, in an out the flows, crossin' over like I'm dribblin'
Runnin' laps round them rappers, tired like Michelin
Started off with Tip and 'em but that wasn't it for him
Yellow, gold Cuban, diamonds blue like Michigan
Been taught you niggas that there's +Levels+ and there's differences
to this lifestyle, the way a real nigga livin' it
I'm gettin' it, nigga put yourself in my predicament
If you was gettin' all of this fuckin' money, you won't spend this shit
I be at the dealership, pointin' out and pickin' shit
Just to shake the town up, talkin' off the rictor shit
Take 'em to the clear port, no Instagram, picture it
Niggas takin' pictures for the Instagram, you in the shit
On the jet, fifty for the flight to go to LIV and shit
Spend another thirty on the champ and never sipped the shit
One million, two million, three million, four
I can have a million dollars knockin' at my door
Ridin' in the passenger, like Tupac Shakur
Only thing that's different is this new Glock that roar
Get a rush from the paper, rush from the money
If money talk it's like you said hush to your money
These broke niggas say I talk too much about the money
That's what we do it for the love of the money
Nigga...

[DJ Drama]
You know I'm up next right?

{*instrumental fades away at the 2:11 mark*}

[Interlude: Allen Iverson sample]
"We're sittin' here, I'm supposed to be the franchise player
And we're in here talking about practice
Not the, not the, not the game that I go out there and die for
And play every game like it's my last; not the game
We talking about practice man
I mean how silly is that? Man we talking about practice
What are we talkin' about? Practice? We talking about practice man {*laughter*}
We talkin' about practice, we talkin' about practice
We ain't talkin' 'bout the game, we talkin' about practice, man"

{*new instrumental starts at the 2:46 mark*}

[Meek Mill] + (DJ Drama)
HAH! You ready? (Tahahah)
{*fading out*} Killed my nigga Snupe, I'm goin' hammer on these niggas
Ridin' through my city with my finger on the trigger
(Just wait for it, Dreamchasers...)</pre>
