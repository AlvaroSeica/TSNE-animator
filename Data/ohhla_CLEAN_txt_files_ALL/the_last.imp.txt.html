[Cougnut]
The bullet hit him in his back then came out his chest
This wouldn't have happened if he left the house with his vest
I was rollin through this neighborhood known for drama
I wasn't trippin cause I had to drop my partner's momma
Off at her house deep into the crazy part
of the 'jects where the funk and the drama start
Seen these marks who had beef about a year ago
Straight plexin bout a no good dirty ho
They seen my boy recognize us from the party right
Roll up hill in a bucket and straight open fire
Let a sucker straight duck but my Boone was hit
Bleedin bad from the chest I said "Aw shit"
I straight mash burnin rubber on the freeway bro
Strikin mad on the freeway straight to general
My bullet bad coughin blood up on the gurney G
They rushed him fast to the back straight to surgery
Got on the phone called up Fresh I said, "Hurry C"
Get to the hospital general emergency
Just then I seen the doc and he was smokin Kools
I said, "What's up", he said, "Nut I got some bad news"
I started cryin, I had to shake my head
Because I knew, my dog was DEAD

[Hook]
He took a breath and he knew he'd breathed his last breath {4x}
"Don't ask me why, cause I'm down in a suit and tie"
He took a breath and he knew he'd breathed his last breath {3x}
"Don't ask me why, cause I'm down in a suit and tie"

[Cougnut]
I know who did it so I payed the little marks a visit
Old school Mob with my boys all four windows tinted
Caught 'em slippin straight trippin on the late night
Fightin with his broad, trying to keep his game tight
Hit the corner with no headlights
Drinkin on a St. Ides, puffin on a blunt right
He seen the bucket started runnin cause he felt the funk
I hit the gas, caught that ass, put him in the trunk
Tied his ankles up with chains, for what it's worth
Drug his ass by the public through the fucken turf
Let loose a clip in the air cause I didn't care
People stare cause body parts is flying everywhere
I tried to lift his whole set with that Mac 11
And put every motherfucker on channel 7
But I cut from the drama but I'm not through
Here comes the boys in blue, plus the crew from channel 2
Askin questions bout the outlook of the fate
The chunk bodies and the boys with the yellow tape
But it was clean how we did it, so FUCK the task
Askin questions bout the suspects in the Jason mask
I had to do it to a fish my partner's shameful death
He took a breath and he knew he'd breathed his last breath

[Hook]
He took a breath and he knew he'd breathed his last breath
"Don't ask me why, cause I'm down in a suit and tie"

(Phone ringing)

(Talking)
Hello (Hey, what's up Nut, man is you alright)
Yeah man, I'ma make it man
But my family over here trippin man
(Aight, me and Supafly on the way to come swoop you up in the limo)

[Cougnut]
Time to go my boy swoop me in a limo
Louis and Rives bound to another funeral
Just last week I lost another damn close ace
This shit is crazy seems like I can't leave this place
It was sad cause everybody was in a state of trauma
I felt bad as I cried with my partner's momma
Reminiscin' bout the times that we used to share
Bustin hoes everywhere now he's outta there
It ain't no joke when a brother get gunned down
Specially from a brother from the same town
I'm tryin to send my little message to express my rage
Instead of pickin up yo gauge turn the fucken page
And if you can't tear it off till another day
And throw the dogs instead of pickin up that HK
We already out numbered by that other race
Slow your pace and stop workin for that penal face
Cause everytime you do a drive-by and shoot up bloods in
Later down your life they find it was your cousin
And that ain't fly to watch your momma and your peoples cry
All you need to do is try and ask yourself why?
It might be you next layin in that box to rest
You took a breath and you knew you breathed your last breath

[Hook]
He took a breath and he knew he'd breathed his last breath
"Don't ask me why, cause I'm down in a suit and tie"

He took a breath and he knew he'd breathed his last breath {3x}
"Don't ask me why, cause I'm down in a suit in tie"

He took a breath and he knew he'd breathed his last breath {3x}

He took a breath and he knew he'd breathed his last breath {3x}
"Don't ask me why, cause I'm down in a suit in tie"

He took a breath and he knew he'd breathed his last breath</pre>
