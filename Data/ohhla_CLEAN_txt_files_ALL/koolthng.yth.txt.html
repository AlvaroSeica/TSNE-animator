Kool Thing sittin with a kitty
Now you know you're sure lookin' pretty
like a lover, not a dancer
Superboy take a lil' chance here
I don't wanna... I don't think so...
I don't wanna... I don't think so...
 
Kool Thing let me play it with your +Radio+
Move me, turn me on, baby-o
I'll be your slave
Give you a shave
I don't wanna... I don't think so...
I don't wanna... I don't think so...
 
[Chuck D]
Yeah~! 
Tell 'em 'bout it 
Hit 'em where it hurts
 
[Kim Gordon] (Chuck D)
Hey Kool Thing, come here.... sit down beside me
There's something I gotta ask you
I just wanna know.. what are you gonna do for me?
I mean, are you gonna liberate us girls 
from male, white, corporate oppression? (Tell it like it is)
Huh? (Yeah!)
Don't be shy (Word up!)
+Fear of a Female Planet+ (+Fear of a Female Planet+) 
(Fear, baby!)
I just want to know that we can, still be friends
(Let everybody know) C'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon
Kool -- Thing 
Kool -- Thing
 
When you're a star, I know that you'll fix everything..
 
Kool Thing sittin with a kitty
Now you know you're sure lookin' pretty
Rock the beat, just a lil' faster
Now I know you are the master
I don't wanna... I don't think so...
I don't wanna... I don't think so...
 
Kool Thing +Walking like a Panther+
Come on and give me an answer
Kool Thing +Walking like a Panther+
...What'd he say??
I don't wanna... I don't think so...
I don't wanna... I don't think so...</pre>
