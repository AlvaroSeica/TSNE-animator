[Hook]
I'll pour your blood in the streets
I'll put your face in the dirt
pick you up and take you straight to the nurse
from the hospital room you go straight to your hearse
then the paulbearers take you to church (*repeat 2X*)

I'll pour your blood in the streets

[Verse 1]
I tote hammers around like cell phones keep 'em on my belt
so if you think you hotter than toon keep it to yourself
Yeah I'm holding conversation you can speak to it yourself
Just know when I reach I ain't reaching for my health
and it ain't just for me I just ain't speakin for myself
But every angel go hard to be in sequence with myself
I run around spittin flame extinguishing myself
and nobody gave me this vision I seen the shit myself
far as rap go I'm just competing with myself
so some of my nicest bars I'm speaking to myself
rap niggaz can't fuck with me I'm sleeping with myself
and I'm having my biggest issues beefin with myself
might do some dumb shit to get even with myself
but look how far I got just believing in myself nigga

[Hook - 2X]
I'll pour your blood in the streets
I'll put your face in the dirt
pick you up and take you straight to the nurse
from the hospital room you go straight to your hearse
then the pall bearers take you to church  (*repeat 2X*)
I'll pour your blood in the streets

[Verse 2]
Spits the pain on ya I spill ya blood in the gutter
stretch your vains on the corner put your face in your shoulders 
lights out game is over get you hit for five cent
who got change for a quarter
y'all only hot as your last bar
and ain't half as tough as they act dog
bury cowards in they own back yard 
it ain't a muthafuckin thing change shit naw
picture me piss drunk
don't go talking that slick shit
you faggots know exactly how the angels get down
approach us with a fucked up attitude and get banged down
hit you with the fifth or get clipped with the tre pound
I'll pour your blood in the streets
Don't go talking that slick shit
you faggots know exactly how the angels get down
approach us with a fucked up attitude and get banged down
hit you with the fifth or get clipped with the tre pound

[Hook]
I'll pour your blood in the streets
I'll put your face in the dirt
pick you up and take you straight to the nurse
from the hospital room you go straight to your hearse
then the paulbearers take you to church  (*repeat 2X*)
I'll pour your blood in the streets

[Verse 3]
Don't go talking that slick shit
you faggots know exactly how the angels get down
approach us with a fucked up attitude and get banged down
hit you with the fifth or get clipped with the tre pound
I'll pour your blood in the streets
Don't go talking that slick shit
you faggots know exactly how the angels get down
approach us with a fucked up attitude and get banged down
hit you with the fifth or get clipped with the tre pound

I'll pour your blood in the streets
I'll put your face in the dirt
pick you up and take you straight to the nurse
from the hospital room you go straight to your hearse
then the paulbearers take you to church  (*repeat 2X*)

I'll pour your blood in the streets</pre>
