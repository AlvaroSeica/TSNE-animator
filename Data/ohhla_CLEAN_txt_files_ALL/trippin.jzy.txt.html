[Intro]
yea (yea)
i said yea nigga
yea (yea)
I'm trippin
I'm tripper
I'm trippin nigga

[Verse 1: Young Jeezy]
look what the fucks up heard it's going down
headin to my bitchs house on the other side of town
plus that remy got my head going round and round
100 mils a hour and I'm smellin like half a pound
as soon as I hit the door she coming out her panties
got a nigga excited like I won my first grammy
I'm a boss motherfucker I do it b.i.g
tell king kong he ain't got shit on me
87 head to toe I got that shit on me
and yea your girl a real rider she like to sit on me
i told her all the sites zone you can chill on me
and I don't want your bitch holmes so you can chill on me
and if the nigga insecure then you can count on young
100 percent guarantee he won't get sprung
he was blowing up our phone and she was on my lap
the way she was blowing up my bomb I almost forgot my strap

[chorus: x2]
I'm trippin
I'm trippin
I'm trippin
I'm trippin
I'm trippin
I'm trippin
I'm trippin
and I don't know why

[Verse 2]
I'm trippin them all my fault
the way I'm switching on these nigga they call me flip mode
why cause I bust them out then I dig em out
then I roll a spliff then I kick 'em out
got my rider bra I ain't bring the kittens out
cause I ain't nervous when a nigga bring the spitters out
they I'm trippin I say chill baby calm down
so you just standing there teacher get the man down
that nigga trippin don't he call himself young o day?
plus I don't play I let it spray I'm all about my pay
and if you think I'm trippin fuck you have a nice day
and while you think I'm trippin i'll be trippin to the base

[Chorus: x2]
I'm trippin
I'm trippin
I'm trippin
I'm trippin
I'm trippin
I'm trippin
I'm trippin
and I don't know why
