[BLAKE RICHARDS]
Remember that night
So cold and so dark
Kind of like your heart...
I wanted to die
I wanted to cry
I wish we can go from the start
I'm trying to run
I'm trying to hide
But just know that I will...

[CHORUS]
Cry tonight
My hands around your hands
I won't let you...
Die tonight
My heart's in your hands
I won't let you...
Die

Don't want to fight
I don't want to write
Any more songs about you
Still waiting it out
Why do you have to shout
I just want to forget you
I was trying to run
Trying to hide
But just know that I will...

[REPEAT CHORUS]

Die, Die, Die
I won't let you...
Die, Die, Die
I won't let you...
Dieeeeeeeeeeeee</pre>
