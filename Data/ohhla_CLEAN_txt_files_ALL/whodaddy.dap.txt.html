Song:   Who's the Daddy?
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I do my thing, I do my thing

I'm getting paper, fucking hate, I'm gonna see you later
All it is, a low range, around few exchanger
You interrogate, BBD interrogators
I'll not be running through these streets like my brother, Beaver
Alligators is that I rob you from your parents gates
You know me, I'm here to chat in everybody's change
I say this rap game has died, I came to save it
Everybody here is nuts, but this song will save it
I never let nobody carry me, streets made a mad on be, rap be my family
Slow told, no edit, no throw, I play it quite dilly
Never had a silver screen and let nobody count for me
I'm not a star, I'm the motherfucking galaxy
Catch me, if you can, but it ain't nobody gonna be catching me
Sorry anybody, if you're hurt, it goes by me
In my fools, this guy's stuck, play the rapper's debt

'cause they don't do what we do, beemis wanna fuck us
I'm fly on a seagull, I'm the daddy, daddy
Sign me on a hoard, putting on to my people
Suck a dick, suck a dick, I ain't the one moving the pedo
I drive these bitches crazy, you ain't having my kid
But you can always dream, my baby, I'm the daddy-daddy
I do my thing, I do my thing, I get it in
So you wanna talk shit? You kill 'em, badda-boom, badda-bing, badda-bing

Middle finger up, how you save the rap
Loud mouth, many movements, getting in the banger
Everybody for my present like I'm Adam Sandler
I ain't ever stunk a bee, but I'd stink a ganja
Stuck you up, star, make 'em throw their hands up
You said fun, you see the fun, they're singing Benny Banks songs
I know that I'm in the zone, but I ain't be in anger
Courtesy, North London, that's where I come from
I'll admit it, guys, I don't represent the dungeon
I gave you boom, bang, bang, but I ain't put you down, yet
Before I turn badda-bing into a numb
But most of you rappers is easy competition, might never offend you
Bunch of actors acting like some gangsters
But they're really wanksters, just a bunch of pranksters
You should try dry costumes, some Dirty Sanchos
I see my rap fisting up kind of hostess

'cause they don't do what we do, beemis wanna fuck us
I'm fly on a seagull, I'm the daddy, daddy
Sign me on a hoard, putting on to my people
Suck a dick, suck a dick, I ain't the one moving the pedo
I drive these bitches crazy, you ain't having my kid
But you can always dream, my baby, I'm the daddy-daddy
I do my thing, I do my thing, I get it in
So you wanna talk shit? You kill 'em, badda-boom, badda-bing, badda-bing

Big smile on my face, I be getting money
Pull my name out your mouth, never been a dentist
Imma put my hands out my fans, many thanks, 'cause we just set up a new grudge

Who's the daddy, daddy?
'cause they don't do what we do, beemis wanna fuck us
I'm fly on a seagull, I'm the daddy, daddy
Sign me on a hoard, putting on to my people
Suck a dick, suck a dick, I ain't the one moving the pedo
I drive these bitches crazy, you ain't having my kid
But you can always dream, my baby, I'm the daddy-daddy
I do my thing, I do my thing, I get it in
So you wanna talk shit? You kill 'em, badda-boom, badda-bing, badda-bing

Who's the daddy, daddy?</pre>
