Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1: Smoke DZA]
Bosses is how we prone to think
Communicate with killers via core links
Some of my niggas went from the corner to the coroner
I made it out, luxury bust, tourin' love, right
Feelin' better than head on the wake up
Roll me up a bomber like it's great stuff
Won a couple dollars of the next verse
Pacers as I'm ranged up
Already in better days than Ice Cube had
That's word to Terrence Howard, durag
All my life I've been a cool cat (word)
I bought the seven and some Ewings
You lookin bad in that bullshit you in
I speak ebonics and Ben Franklin fluent
Every boss once was the best student
Been hustler since the true one
I'm a top ten nigga, L7
You a fuckin square nigga, we could never square it wit ya
DZA

[Chorus]
Bring in the music
(Them niggas wanna get right
And they fuckin with the jet life)
It's my gift to you

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
Yea bitch
They gotta weigh it on a scale they weigh the wales with
With one sniff I make a german sheppard back flip
3 small gold chains, 2 pinky rings
And one big fuckin' dream to own all this
Empire under construction
Hard hats zone, work going on
Hazardous habits has me hustling but fuck it holmes
Master this grab but as the cash stacks
Bitches is going bad for that
Put you on light socks, put you on like my watch
Put you up like a poster
Lucky motherfuckers getting ganged from the cultures and didn't even know it
The last Don poets
Who never sold they souls and still in motion
Breaking that do' in
And you silly motherfuckers thought it's just bout smoking
Shit

[Chorus]
Bring in the music
(Them niggas wanna get right
And they fuckin with the jet life)
It's my gift to you
(Them niggas wanna get right
And they fuckin with the jet life)
Bring in the music
(Them niggas wanna get right
And they fuckin with the jet life)
It's my gift to you

[Outro]
We sing a song
Especially for you</pre>
