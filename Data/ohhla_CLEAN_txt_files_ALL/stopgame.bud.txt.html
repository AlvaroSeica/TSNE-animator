[Intro: Yung Budd]
Uh, yeah, one more again
About to do it up, holla
Hahaha, one more time
Let the beat drop
This is something for life

[Yung Budd]
Mami, I'm mellow, love that Accapello
Stay John Blazed, pockets jiggle like Jello
Hello, hello, I'm that fellow
Flow mad sick so I got that cheddo
Call me, let's fly to P.R.
Hit up the telly, I'll buy out thee bar
Me's a star, loves the name
Got mad whips, and I love rocking these chains
I got a wifey though, she's at home
I'm a playa, can't help it, horny, he got to moan
So, what you doing out in Rio? Where's ya horse?
Only pimp out mami's, rock Chris Dior's
Said, "I'm here with my man, there he is"
This nigga tried to wild out, "I ain't fucking ya wiz"
Mami feeling Yung C though, smaller version of Chino
5'8", brown skin, chips like the Rio
She knows, my pockets stay extremely cheesy
Ya girl feeling me, dog, you need to leavey

[Chorus: Yung Budd]
Stop the game...
Uh-huh, cuz I ain't playing...
Faggot, stop the game...
Uh, cuz I ain't playing...

[Yung Budd]
I keep my hat cocked, brim breezed up
Iced out wrist that ya homies could snow ski up
P4ers, carry big things like Ne-yo
Tell her hop in they block, incognito
Cats don't know, what we know
But, they gonna find out when I'm blowing missles like Al 'Cino
A Goodfella like DeVito, put a Scar on ya face
I spend dough so fast, need a parking space
Place the gates so tight, mami's call me Matell
Put country music on the street, it better to sell
Ten million sold, got diamond rings
A bad chicked named Diamond with diamond chains
Nahmean? Big up B.K. for real
Come on, son, so please don't squeal

[Chorus: Yung Budd]
So, stop the game...
Come on, uh, cuz I ain't playing... (nah, that's how it's going)
So, stop the game...
Cuz I ain't playing...

[Yung Budd]
It ain't where you from, nigga, it's where you at
When you rest at my hive, where he gon' get your gat?
Cuz niggaz know I get more action than Jackson
The packing the mack then
Have the bullets loving your ass, fatal attraction
Hit you in the back, then, slide with Venus
So she can put it on me, like Ja and Vita
Ya everyday Bonnie and Clyde
No coke, no crack, just a little chronic inside
Plus I stay on top of the ride
I got them new rims that keep on spinning even though I stop at the lot
So I ride through the block where the haters rest
The rims make 'em feel woozy while I spray they chest
Put ya hands up, nah, put 'em down
I'm a real nigga, don't fuck with clowns
He's a circus act, who you smirking at?
I spread ya blood around the world so you could cross the map

[Chorus: Yung Budd]
Stop the game...
Come on, huh, cuz I ain't playing...
It's not a game, so, stop the games...
Come on, yo, cuz I ain't playing...
So, stop the games... stop it, need to stop acting...
Cuz I ain't playing...

[Outro: Yung Budd]
All the games is for these little guys, stop it, come on
Duck-Lo Productions, doing it up
Buddha Monk, good looking for the beat, dog
Daddy Warbucks, Love Blesser, holla... holla...</pre>
