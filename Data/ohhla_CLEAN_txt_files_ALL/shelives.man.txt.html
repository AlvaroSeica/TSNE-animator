Hey there love
Hey There love

[VERSE 1]

Hello rhythm and blues
How's hip-hop doing
Lately some been sayin' she's in ruins
Think she better off playin' with Afrobeat
She's best when she manifests a style that's unique
Wanna introduce her to the highlife
MPC her hips let them swing right
She's over quantized, obese with bass and 808s
Wonder if she's gay or straight?
She fell in love with soul real early
James Brown beat breaks made her Grammy worthy
Heard she handle her Biz Markie
When she sing like Alicia she always on key
She's hated on by disco
Came on the scene and did a quick overthrow
She laugh, HAHA, and say whatever yo
Same shit, different asshole
I cry for you

[CHORUS]

Hey there love
Wipe those tears away
Hey there love
You can if you want to stay
You know that I want you want you want you
Want you to stay
You know that I need you need you need you
Need you to stay
You know that I want you want  you want you 
Want you to stay
You know that I need you need you need you
Need you to stay

[VERSE 2]

Death before dishonor
But, but but your honor
She too young too die
She need a new lawyer
Give her proper defense against the offense
Humbly appeal unjust death sentence
C'mon, give her a chance, one last dance
She can reform, she just need a helping hand
He who hath no sin, let him begin to cast the first stone
(order, order, clemency granted to the . . .)
I got a scheme to get her back to fitness
M.anifest slim-fast plan 
Bear witness
Teach her history
Tidbits to add to the stew
Bebop, Grandfather hated like you
Jazz your uncle, older cousin rock Ã”n' roll
Gospel the reason you got so much soul
Africa your true original home
So don't forget blackness is all in your bones
I miss you
