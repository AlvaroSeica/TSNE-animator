[Verse 1]
Can I tell ya'll a story
About my history
I'm sure a lot ya'll can relate to me
You see I'm from the ghetto
A place where me and my brother shared 
The hardwood floor when the winter was cold
I'm talkin about the ghetto
said the ghet the ghet the ghet
I'm not going to stay here no
I got plans to get out of here
I see my name, big lights
Oh Lord I wanna take some of that good life
I wanna be

[Chorus]
I want to be 
A superstar, go get them
Superstar,oh I wanna be yeah
I've got be dreams 
Of being a, superstar go get them
Superstar (a ghetto super star)
That is all I wanna be

[Verse 2]
What you know about that hard knock life?
What you know about that ware fare life?
Scrape for dinner and government cheese
Praying for the Lord
Lord you bless me
Oh, and get grandmama out
Try to buy every Foot Locker out
Living ghetto fabolous no doubt
You know what I'm talking about
I wanna be...

[Chorus]
Rolling out slamming cadillac doors
Holding down every homie I know
Never ever ever will I be broke
I wanna be I wanna be a ghetto superstar
Rolling out slamming cadillac doors
Never ever ever will I be broke
Holding down every homie I know
I wanna be I wanna be a ghetto superstar

[Talking]
And if some of ya'll went through what i went through
You know I just want ya'll to bob ya'll head
Cause you know every one didn't come from great homes

[Chorus]</pre>
