Yeah
Hmm
Can you dig that?
Hmm
Can you feel that?
Can you feel that?
Yeah, uh
Can you...
Yeah, yeah
Let me stick you with this
Lets see, can you feel...

I grab my pen, caressin' empty pages,
I grab my pen, caressin' empty pages,
Makin' love, creatin' money makin' phrases,
Let me mold you, into what I dreamed you would be
Let the world see your beauty and associate it with me
When I'm poor and broke down,
Lookin' bummy with no money
I can feel you in my soul
Close my eyes and let you take control
I grab my pen, caressin' empty pages,
I grab my pen, caressin' empty pages,
Makin' love, creatin' money makin' phrases,
Makin' love, creatin' money makin' phrases,
When I'm alone,
You comfort me and soothe my head,
When we get down, we don't need no hotel room or bed
Give me head, suck my brain, and watch it shoot out lyrics
Into your ears, makin' you pregnant with EightBall's spirit

If you take a look inside my mind
Within' you'll find my baby
Love so high, I'm blessed by God
I pray that'll you'll always stay
My first love
My first love

Yeah
I could feel you
I love the way you give it to me
I can you feel you, I love the way you give it to me
Make me feel like a king, and I won't give your love away
Make me feel like a king, and I won't give your love away
Sacrifice, so no one can run away with you
Give my life, cause all I want to do is be with you
Some don't think, a nigga like me should speak freely
Tell you tricks how I feel
With my original poetry
See, when I didn't have shit, on the street
Tryin' to hit a lick
Didn't nobody try to give me shit
I worked for it and got jerked for it
Got hurt for it
Still in the mix, these tricks never knew I could last long
Come strong
And make a nigga pick me up like a ringin' telephone
I grab my pen, caressin' empty pages,
I grab my pen, caressin' empty pages,
Makin' love, creatin' money makin' phrases,
Makin' love, creatin' money makin' phrases,
When I'm alone
Yuo comfort me and soothe my head
When we get down, we don't need no hotel room or bed
Give me head, suck my brain, and watch it shoot out lyrics
Into your ears, makin' you pregnant with EightBall's spirit

If you take a look inside my mind
Within' you'll find my baby
Love so high, I'm blessed by God
I pray that'll you'll always stay
My first love
My first love
If you take a look inside my mind
Within' you'll find my baby
Love so high, I'm blessed by God
I pray that'll you'll always stay
My first love
My first love</pre>
