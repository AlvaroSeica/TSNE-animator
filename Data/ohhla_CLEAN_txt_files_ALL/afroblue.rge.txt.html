[Erykah Badu]
Dream of a land, my soul is from
I hear a hand, stroke on a drum
Shades of delight, cocoa hue
Rich as the night, afro blue 
 
Elegant boy, beautiful girl
Dancing for joy, delicate whirl
Shades of delight cocoa hue
Rich as the night, afro blue
 
[Chorus] 
Two lovers dance face to face with undulating grace
They gently sway then slip away to some secluded place
Shades of delight cocoa hue
Rich as the night, afro blue

[Erykah Badu]
Dream of a land, my soul is from
I hear a hand, stroke on a drum
Shades of delight, cocoa hue
Rich as the night, afro blue 

Elegant boy, beautiful girl
Dancing for joy, delicate whirl
Shades of delight cocoa hue
Rich as the night, afro blue</pre>
