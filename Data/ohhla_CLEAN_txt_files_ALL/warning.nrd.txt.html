[Intro]
Uhh! Yeah
Uhh - quick shout out
Rusty whattup man? Uhh
Okay...

[Nerd Ferguson]
Uhh~! Here we go again
Mr. Nerd Ferguson, everywhere I go I win
And even if I lose, I'm a winner in the end
Like even if a chick says no, I'm in her in the end
Yeah! Niggaz can pretend all they want and all they wish
that I ain't what I is, which is the illest in this bitch
Give you agony of +da feet+, Curt Schilling in this bitch
Get a load of me, it's just Curt chillin in this bitch - yeah!
Swag, Ferg' killin in this shit
Killer lyricist, specialty, killin lyrics is
Don't do the killer lyrics, killin isn't cool
but I kill you if I must, so nigga don't be a fool (uh)
Rather spend my days just sittin out in a pool
watchin big booty chicks as they gettin out of the pool
Competition hard to find like niggaz in Liverpool
So chances are, you niggaz'll freakin lose
Rusty Redenbacher my freakin dude
He hit me and he told me to do what I freakin do
So when I do what I does and all of you kids lost
in a roundabout way, it's kind of his fault!
Yeah, the finest in this
Me grippin the mic is like a pint of Guinness
A Guinness for the nicest with the mic I might be in it
And if I'm not, get a pen and write me in it

[Chorus]
Uhh, here's a warning - don't sign me
Yeah I'm a nerd, who knew a nerd could be so grimey?
Give me that advance check, cop me some kicks
so when it's to record I bet you bastards won't find me
Uhh, hire me if you wanna
Sign me in the spring bet you fire me in the summer
Bummer! Find me in a Hummer
with another one behind me, sittin inside of another

[Nerd Ferguson]
Tired of fuckers tryin to fire my way
Don't even try it unless you desire dyin today
Every rhyme that I say is like I'm rubbin my hands
with some slow motion birds behind me flyin away
Hop up in my whip and just start ridin away
while you ridin the A next to a bum and slidin away
I'm crazy - crazy! Niggaz don't want it with son
so like it or not, I am likely to stay
One of the most non-violent rappers in the world
but violate and catch a right and a left right to your face
Can't impress upon you how these rappers can't impress me
In fact until they progress, these rappers can't address me
My lil' homey hit me up and he told me
my new shit is dope but he kinda miss the old me
So when you hear me spittin and I sound pissed off
in a roundabout way, it's kinda his fault!

[Chorus]

[Nerd Ferguson]
"I'm not a star? Somebody lied"
I got a chopper in the house, watch that motherfucker fly
If I died today, remember me like Teairra MarÃ­
or Ciara's career, better prepare to be scared
Game needs a hero and I'm apparently here
No deal cause these labels apparently scared (uh)
You better get, while the gettin is good
instead of poppin shit, like you get it in in your hood
O-KAY! I don't believe you niggaz is hood
In fact, I think some of you niggaz got a clitoral hood (okay?)
Cum/Come against us, I fuckin wish that you would/wood
Don't even live where you live, but I'm the shit in your hood (okay?)
Gotta hold it down for my city
Whack niggaz run around claimin the crown for my city
And that wasn't subliminal, but just in case you thought it was?
Papoose, chill with all that shit you talkin cuz

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Wooo~! Uhh, yes, yes, Nerd to the Ferg
A-T-F, Nerd to the Ferg
Sound Council, Nerd to the Ferg
Nerd Ferg, Nerd to the Ferg
Uhh, yeah
We back! We back!
Uhh, yeah</pre>
