Song:   Did I Do That?
Typed by: mothegreat@bet.com

[Mariah Carey]
I really hope when you hear this song
That you're happy with somebody new (happy, na, na, na, na)
Baby because I am the love I can call my own
And I know I'm apart from you

(Bridge)  (x4)
[Mystikal]
We can't stop now
We can't stop
You can't stop 
So [bitch] don't try

[Mariah Carey]
Don't you know that you seem
Just a little crazy
And I trust in intimacy
But you threw it away
Just threw it away
Now that's all in the past
When I think of you I just laugh
My friends must of thought I was high
Cause I given so much to someone not worth my time

(Chorus)
[Mariah Carey]
Funny how sometimes 
You can really lose your mind
And do things you would never do
Did I do that?
You have sometimes
You get caught up in the high
Till your senses return to you
Love played you for a fool

[Mariah Carey]
You were so insecure
And your crew was so immature 
Conversations getting weak
It was much better off when we didn't speak
But gotta tell you the truth
It was my illusion of you
Being so how destined for me
It had me in a daze
But, when I was seeing you

(Chorus)

[Mariah Carey]
I really hope when you heat this song
That you know it was meant for you (you, you, you, you)
Know you're the one to ride alone
Try to do the best you can do

(Bridge) w/ adlibs from Mariah Carey  (x4)

(Chorus)  (Repeated till fade)
(This time Mystikal instead of Mariah Carey says did I do that.)
 
(Bridge)  (Repeated till fade)
(Comes in after the 2nd Chorus Behind Chorus)

[Master P]
(Behind Chorus &amp; Bridge)
It ain't my fault (x15)</pre>
