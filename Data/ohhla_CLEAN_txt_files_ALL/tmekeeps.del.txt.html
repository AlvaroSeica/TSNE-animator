Yeah, that's the funky funky shit, ay bust it, yo, yo 
 
Deltron tremendous force to end your courssssse
Every whim is enforced 
I send men with torches to raid your fortress 
And in the process radiate your optics 
Subconsciously haunt emcees 
Super human technician atomic inner dimension 
Too mental with intuition 
Typographical aptitude let my lasers clap at you 
Mapped the route, psychologically crappin out, what youlaughing bout? 
Imitations getting penetrated in free simulations 
In my emcee training class remain in mass 
Never get liquidated convert energy 
Into matter instantly, with a pen and pad 
Calculate the Sino graph, heat the center of gravity 
Abolish apathy graphically packing 380's 
With body heat sensitive bullets you need safety 
Fest on your face and neck 
Mental armory levitate legs for my monarchy 
No malarkey my flows embarking 
Zionically sparking brain cells til they're sparkling 
(chorus) x2 
 
No one knows the time passing by.
 
I remake my universe every time I use a verse 
To fulfill my destiny, emcees rest in peace 
Side barriers provide care within 
From impurities every word sees your attention like thirddegree 
I subjugate you other fake performers while the bass of yourface 
No sense you be in attempt fleeting 
Emcees siphon my likeness 
Biting my insides like five enchiladas 
This plain of existence is amazingly different 
From my orbital oratory always going for the glory 
You pop wide open from my slice slogans 
I stay in effect with alien tech 
Make you wanna say he's the best
With synchronization with commendation its armor plated hard to fake it 
Never carbonated, scar your matrix 
Virtually uncertainty, murk your mediocre sheets and sofa 
With my style of energy, del assembling 
A realm where anything, is possible 
NASA scientists can't define this 
Mechanical mind set diamond alignment 

(chorus) 
 
Mathematical astro grapple a flow, pterodactyl 
Very factual crash course, last resort,Â  cast me off 
At last we warp to my own world, my own neurological cubbyhole 
Open the airshaft I'll be there fast! 
With spare raps to tear back their mass 
Deltron experimental critical literal 
Professor test the pitiful 
Micronautalyst interchangeable 
All of this gamma grammar far from bema 
Got mind control bandannasÂ  
To control your clan with scanners 
Brand the planet like a band of bandits 
Who man the cannons and guns with random 
Sub atomic, love of logic, bug with phonics 
Tub of chronic low in bridle with controlling ciphers 
Unraveling rhyme, in traveling time 
Alien life form mail in a pipe bomb 
Deltoid life long I write songs 
Monarch absolute, serve a glass of proof 
When I vanish leave my spirit in a planet 
On top of the surface my words and wit emerging
