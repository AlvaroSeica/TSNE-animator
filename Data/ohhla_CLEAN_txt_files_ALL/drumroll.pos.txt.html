In a world where the world ends at the end of your block
and them uh, little whirlwinds spin friction round the clock
I'll be savage, hunt and gather the average rather cadaver
Cock back hammer, splatter matter all over cell phone and calendar
No peace, yeah, in the middle of a war zone, riddle when the norm thinks slow
No sleep, yeah, with the shades down low, on the down low fighting with a dream
I creep, yeah, all secrets please, I don't need to speak
I'm paranoid like a man in the land of the free
To set up and let us burn and turn cheek, damn
Stop with the octagon, top your block, I'm gone
off my rock, no songs, no more locked, yeah
Just a little bit a prison for everyone of us
We won't listen till there isn't any more of us
These days we quick to part ways with rights like "okay"
Here, let's be clear, for the record I did not sign up for lockdown
or any kind of shock and I'm so bored

[Chorus]
You must have forgot just who you were dealing with
Nothing less than aggression so naked, so crystal clear with a
trust in absolutely fucking nothing but Doomtree
Step up your thought game lame, we're all thirsty!

[P.O.S.]
It's like they leave us no option
Walking these streets, heat is watching
These preachers speak from they pockets
These teachers, bring it back c'mon
These teachers reach but can't stop it
Seedlings so poisoned, so lost and
follow these prophets to nonsense
Tossing what's right to the dust
And I ain't no casualty
Got no surface with spotless morality
My dirt might have to cover up my grave
But I keep my fear of faith
and filth clutter up my cave
Got me looking for disinfectant
(I don't know how to behave)
God, I'm bored!

[Chorus]
You must have forgot just who you were dealing with
Nothing less than aggression so naked, so crystal clear with a
trust in absolutely fucking nothing but Doomtree
Step up your thought game lames, we're all thirsty!

[Crowd]
Mooooooooore!...
So thirsty for mooooooooore!...</pre>
