[Verse 1: B.G.]
In 93 I hit the scene first album True Story
I was psyched off ghetto boys no nuts no glory
then I bounced back wit the classic Chopper City
had every nigga in new orleans rolling with me
then I shook back with that fuckin Volume One
real street niggas was respeccin how it come
then I doubled back with that fuckin Volume Two
you know the name of em it was All On U
a minute after that was Chopper City In The Ghetto
I could'a came harder i kept it a lil' mello
I went to jail came home dropped Checkmate
and made it official B.Gizzle aint fake
left Cash Money hit em upp wit Livin Legend
had to bust a move baby was doin to much reppin
now im back again aint a damn thing funny
this album number eight Life After Cash Money
