[The Weeknd]
Why you rushing me baby?
It's only us, alone
I don't want to die tonight, baby
So lemme sip this slow
I'll give you what you called for
Just let me get in my zone
I'll be makin love to her through you
So let me keep my eyes closed
 
[Chorus: The Weeknd] (Drake)
And I won't see a damn thing, I can't feel.. a damn thing
But I'ma touch you right
Oh, I won't see a damn thing, I can't feel.. a damn thing
But I'ma touch you right, ohh yeah
I'ma touch you right (Just let me sip this slow)
I'ma touch you right (Let me get inside my zone)
I'ma touch you right (Just let me..)
Ooh-whoa-ohhh-ohhhhhh, ooh yeah
 
[The Weeknd]
And I'ma lean... 'eaaan 
'til I fall, oooh yeah
and I don't give a DAMN
I felt the ground before
I left it all behind, baby
I didn't need no one
But I'm in here tonight baby
I've been alone for too long
Ohh~! Oh yeah
 
[Chorus - first line replaces "and" with "so"]
 
[Drake]
Whoa, all these broken hearts on that pole
Man if pole dancing's an art, you know how many fuckin artists I know?
Got some new bills in the mail, got some big favors I owe
Got some good things ahead of me when these bad bitches let go
Well girl let's - go, walk yo' broken heart thru that do'
Sit yo' sexy ass on that couch, wipe that lipstick off of yo' mouth
I take it - slow, she in love with my crew
She said, "Make enough so I can try some," I thought takin drugs just ain't you, be you... 
Yeah girl, just be you
And I do this shit for my hometown, it been goin down, it ain't new
That's that North North, that up top, that OVO and that XO
Yo' girlfriend at our next show, but it's all good, don't stress though
First night fuck, never really planned it
Take a deep breath, no one need to panic
Lips so French, ass so Spanish
You don't really like attention, I don't know if she gon' manage out here..
But she got me all up in my zone
Said she like the view I got in this place, shit I did all of that on my own
Aw yeah</pre>
