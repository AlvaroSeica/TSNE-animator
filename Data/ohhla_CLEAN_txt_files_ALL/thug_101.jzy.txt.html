Let's get it!

[Young Jeezy]
I use to hit the kitchen lights, cockroaches everywhere
Hit the kitchen lights, now it's marble floors everywhere (ha ha)
Call the carpenter, the roof on the coupe's gone (jeah)
Give a fuck what he sold, I'm the truth homes (that's right)
Kitchen's fumed up, niggaz jamming Tupac (jeah)
Get my Benihana's on, working two pots (daaaamn)
Baby need shoes, partner need bail money
Bloodhound for the bread, I just smell money (yeah)
Niggaz just write, I recollect (recollect)
Hands on, Jeezy really counted them checks (yeeeeeah)
I'm Donald Trump in a white tee and white One's (jeah)
The conversation is money nigga, you want some? (ay)

[Hook]
Ay
Ay
Ay
Ay (You gotta believe, you gotta believe)
Ay you ain't never seen them pies
I'm talking so much white, it'll hurt ya eyes
I really lived it man
Counted so much paper, it'll hurt ya hands
Let's get it!

[Young Jeezy]
I'm what the streets made me, a product of my environment (jeah)
Took what the streets gave me, product in my environment (ay)
Now it's 28 inches on the brand new Hummer (Hummer)
Telling ya right now, it's gone be a cold summer (yeeeah)
Blew the brains out the Chevy, call it suicide (cide)
It's a way of life, that's how us young niggaz ride (that's right)
Trap Or Die gave 'em hope, they waiting for the sequel (jeah)
It's clear to see the boy Jeezy do it for the people (ay)

[Hook]
Ay

Let's get it!

[Young Jeezy]
I'm the author of the book, yeah a genius wrote it (jeah)
There's a message in my words, you gotta decode it (ay)
I seen it all, every gram, every bird (what)
I spit the truth, every noun, every verb (that's right)
I never exaggerated one line, one dime (dime)
Never lied to the people, not one time (never)
A hard head make a soft ass (ay)
And hard white will get ya straight cash (ha ha)
