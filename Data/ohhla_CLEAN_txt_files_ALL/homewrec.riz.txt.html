I'm sorry your boyfriend isn't saying alot...oh

He said you're a homewrecker
Well, you should know better
Shes out your league and plus
You know that I'm a go getter
[x2]
I'm a go go get her, I'm a go getter [x4]

Yeah, I'd be lucky to see
Her face when I go clubbing it seems
She picks up her bag as she leaves
Am I a mug to tell her she's my cuppa tea?
I've known her for ages
But I'm looking at my shoes when I try to
Converse with her, know my chat ain't the greatest
Want her to know, there's no one as lovely as me!
Come into my world
But I've gone for a few of her mates and
The concept of getting with friends
Then being their lovers is just for the Spice Girls
And your guy, I don't buy that
I mean look at him he's a right prat
He says don't talk to her like that
I said sorry its like that... LEAVE HER

I'm sorry your boyfriend isn't saying a lot...

He said you're a homewrecker
Well, you should know better
Shes out your league and plus
You know that I'm a go getter
[x2]
I'm a go go get her, I'm a go getter [x4]

He whispered to me, he said brother
Can you be kind?
Another bit of flirting and the ending
Will be we fight
I told him, I completely understand and
You're a sweet guy
But I completely love your girlfriend
so it looks like
I don't really care bruv (she's mine)
Already made up (my mind!)
Cause when I see her (I find)
Every impluse in my body kicks in, the thing is
For me she is worth risking, getting kicked in
But its you she's always kissing and it fucks me off
Yeah yeah yeah yeah homewrecker
I'm what's known as a homewrecker
They call me a homewrecker

I think I'm better off avoiding the girl
Whenever I see her with you it annoys me to hell
And then I'm sorry I don't mean to disappoint
You as well
When you ask me if I'd ever wanna steal her
And the answer is
I don't really care bruv (she's mine)
Already made (my mind!)
Cause when I see her (I find)
Every moral in my body gets lost, and I best not
Confirm myself a guest spot, in a bad track record
Guess what
When I see her I get effed off cause...

He said you're a homewrecker
Well, you should know better
Shes out your league and plus
You know that I'm a go getter
[x2]
I'm a go go get her, I'm a go getter [x4]

I'm sorry your boyfriend isn't saying alot... True
Say whaaat
I'm what's known as a homewrecker
They call me homewrecker
