[Play]
Aiyyo Kid!!
Where's the party?

[Kid]
Check it out, I'm Kid, and I Kid you not
I like the Sprite - I like the Sprite a lot!

[Play]
My name is Play {*scratch*} but I'm not playin
I like the Sprite - you know what I'm sayin?

[alternating between Kid and Play]
I like to kick it live - to establish hype
I like to kick it too - I like the Sprite in you!
I like the Lymon taste - I like a pretty face
I like the lemon lime - you say that all the time!
Well Lymon has the twist of unexpectedness - LIKE THIS~!

{*piano music and 50's dancing*}

[Kid]
Who invited them?

[Play]
I don't know, but I'm with it

[Both]
I LIKE THE SPRITE, IN, YOU!</pre>
