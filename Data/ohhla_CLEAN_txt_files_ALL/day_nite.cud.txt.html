[Kid Cudi - Verse One]
Uh, uh, uh, uh...
Day 'n' nite...
I toss and turn, I keep stress in my mind, mind
I look for peace and see I don't attain
What I need for keeps, this silly game we play...play..
Now look at this...
Madness to magnets keeps attractin me, me
I try to run, but see I'm not that fast
I think I'm first, but surely finish last...last...

[Chorus]
'Cause day 'n' nite...
The lonely stoner seem to free his mind at night
He's all alone through the day 'n' nite
The lonely loner seem to free his mind at night, ah-ah, at nite
'Cause day 'n' nite...
The lonely stoner seem to free his mind at night
He's all alone, some things will never change
The lonely loner seem to free his mind at night, ah-ah, at nite

[Kid Cudi - Verse Two]
Hold the phone, the lonely stoner Mr. solo dolo
He's on the move can't seem to shake the shade
Within his dreams he sees the life he made, made
The pain is deep, a silent sleeper you wont hear a peep, peep
The girl he wants don't seem to want him too
It seems the feelings that she had are through, through

[Chorus]
'Cause day 'n' nite...
The lonely stoner seem to free his mind at night
He's all alone through the day 'n' nite
The lonely loner seem to free his mind at night, ah-ah, at nite
'Cause day 'n' nite...
The lonely stoner seem to free his mind at night
He's all alone, some things will never change
The lonely loner seem to free his mind at night, ah-ah, at nite

[Kid Cudi - verse Three]
Slow mo, when the tempo slows up and creates that new, new.
He seems alive, though he is feelin blue.
The sun is shinnin man hes super cool, cool.
The lonely nites, they fade away he slips into his white Nikes.
He smokes a clip and then hes on the way
To free his mind in search of
To free his mind in search of
To free his mind in search of

[Chorus]
'Cause day 'n' nite...
The lonely stoner seem to free his mind at night
He's all alone through the day 'n' nite
The lonely loner seem to free his mind at night, ah-ah, at nite
'Cause day 'n' nite...
The lonely stoner seem to free his mind at night
He's all alone, some things will never change
The lonely loner seem to free his mind at night, ah-ah, at nite</pre>
