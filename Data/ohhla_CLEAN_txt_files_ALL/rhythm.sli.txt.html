Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Seen the world and back again
See this world is suffering
From things like vanity
Our people can't afford to be
Buzzing us it's few too late
Times are though it's winds of change
Seasons rise and fall
Are bringing heavens from above

Set by the rhythm up here
Open your mind and soul
Knowing your love is blind
Your the only one in control
For all of the world to see
Who's living in the streets
Without the music on the ghetto
Guess we'll just be

Everyone open your eyes
The things we can no longer ride
It's time for you to meet
And give them people what they need</pre>
