[Intro: DJ Military]
My name is DJ Military
Right about now, I want all the big boongie dance right now
Get up on the dance floor, make ya boongie drop!
Elutra massive! 'ere wha gwann, AY~!
 
[Chorus: Lenny Kravitz]
Go sister, roll on it
Don't let the music stop
Girl gon' make that boongie drop
Roll sister, roll on it
Go sister, roll on it
Don't let the music stop
Girl gon' make that boongie drop
Roll sister, roll on it
 
[Lenny Kravitz]
Red light, the speakers pumpin
Flesh-to-flesh, grind and bumpin
Hot pants, green and yellow
Brown thighs, feelin mellow
The beat, of the ghetto
Cornrows, weaves and afros
The deep, birds from Nassau
I'm out to show toniiiiight
 
[Chorus]
 
[Interlude: DJ Military]
Girl, make that boongie drop
Girl, make that boongie drop
Girl, make that boongie drop
Girl, make that boongie drop
 
[Lenny Kravitz]
Black heat, fills the dancehall
Lovebirds, rock the back wall
Junglers, {?} labels
High heels, on the tables
Bare feet, on the dirt floor
No one, cares if you're poor
At three, lockin the door
And comin home toniiiiight
 
[Chorus + Interlude]
 
[Jay-Z]
Uh, put the kids to sleep on this one~!
 
Pop lock and drop it, I make that pussy speak patois
like Patra, ah remember her?
Remember me from the basement parties?
I remember you tight-tight, no pan-ties
My weed blowin all in your tight weave
Rub-a-dubbin so close, steppin on my Nikes
At the red light, never give me red light
Only give me +Green Light+, you know what I mean, right?
After my Red Stripe, hop up on my motorbike
Show me what that motor like, show me you can roll it right
All of my dia-monds, girl, they're Bohemians
All of my Jamaic-i-ans, shake it for me, shake it and... (Yah!)
 
[Chorus 2X + Interlude]</pre>
