[Nelly Furtado]
She's a freak and I'm a chief head banger 
With the top down low on the flow 
Cause you're so fresh (fresh!) like b-boys with vests 
Like runners carved chest hehehehe
 
I run like the breeze 
To catch this life but sometimes get a need til I bleed!
There's truth, I go, there's around, I will tell it 
A story, on the planet, Missy come in and I landed
Well where did she come from? 
This international goddess sun, so get your hands up 
Like this hun until the party's just begun!
So come over to my house and that's where this song's from 
A less for the laugh from west coast version Portuguese diva!
And Missy's the woman who always be cooking, 
Says somethin' for Neltado who come dip her vibin 
From DC to DJ and all around the world 
Come giddy up giddy up back, back up to my girl!

(Chorus)
[Missy (Nelly Furtado)]
Get Ur Freak on (Get, get, get, brrrrrrrrah,  get, get, get)
Get Ur Freak on
Get Ur Freak on
Get, get, get, get, get
Get Ur Freak on

Get Ur Freak on
Get Ur Freak on
Get Ur Freak on(Get, get, get, get, get Ur freak on)
Get, get, get, get, get
Get Ur Freak on

[Missy]

You tired of me with the stamp so let me stamp it though

Something strange in your pool
Cause my fire spin your head 'round like Missy
