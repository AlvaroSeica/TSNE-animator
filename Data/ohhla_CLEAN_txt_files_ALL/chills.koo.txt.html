Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]

[Valure]
The sunlight smiles
Faithful everyday for you
No one can come close to the
Joy you bring to me
Whispers like a summer breeze
To put my mind at ease
When I look into your eyes
I envision you and me
On love's journey
So I wrote this melody
To show you that you send me

[Chorus]
Chills running through my body
Shivering down my spine
Keeps me quivering for you
So happy that your mine
I'm shaken, I can't control myself
Cuz you
You send me chills

[Verse 2]

[Josh]
Come whisper in my ear
Tell me what your heart desires
Girl I feel that youÂ’re the one
That I could spend forever with
You give me that sensation
That no other love can give
[Valure]
Boy what you do for me
Goes far beyond my wildest dreams
[Eddie]
Say you'll never leave
Girl when you look at me
I get this feeling inside of me

[Chorus]

[Valure]
Cold as the winter breeze
Makin my heart freeze
Ooohhhh
Hot as the summer flame
When u say my name

[Eddie]
Sparkling like Perrier
Got me dizzy like Chardonnay

[Valure]
I feel chills
when u look at me
Chills
When u touch me
Chills running all over my body

[Chorus]

[Chorus]
You send me chills [x7]
I can't help it
I can't stop it
I can't fake it
[Valure]
I can't lie
Cuz you send me chills</pre>
