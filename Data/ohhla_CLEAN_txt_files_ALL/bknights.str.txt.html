    "Eat cornbread, come quick" - in slo-mo (5X)

[Christ Bearer]
I keep hearin footsteps in the dark
and Killah-Killah-Killah-Killah in the F-Sharp (F-sharp)
Christbearer the monarch, a West Coast hip-hop shark
You motherfuckin mark, I coerce and nurse the universe
Emmerse the megahertz to a mega from the first
I rule the world like my name is Love
Then knock your ass out, Iron-Fist, velvet gloved
and with the ill gotten game, a Thunderbird to the night train
I go Kurt Cobain, I contemplate the game sippin Vodka, fame
In a chain, a hurricane, on Memory Lane
I'm makin money now, bitch, 'Bling, Bling'
It's Shallah I-Ming, gettin rich with Rakeem
I rock the khakis with the crease and smoke the hashish
with Maurice, that's shield in the leafs
Christbearer be a true artiste
On my momma, my three nephews and my niece

[Meko the Pharaoh]
Control avenues, black and white venues
Diamond cut jewels, found dead on the news
Never choose left cuz the right will remind you
Fuckin with a man that been hurt all his life
Seen Rainy Dayz and, rainy nights
Tattoo of a Bee, holdin the pirate knife
Y'all niggaz done lost your mind, and your time too
Unique rhymes that shine on the divine youth
It's time for us to put it all on the line
Comin from the dynamic vine
Intense like sex off Ex
I wonder what the Devil come up with next
We got ice, 'sherm, coke, weed and meth'
Kill off people to they very last breath
Lethal attack, straight live on the set
Quick jive on the set
So dip your black MO's and get wet
and turn up the volume a little bit

[Midnight]
Yo it's on when I touch the mic, head the crime hype
Beat that ass like Mike, I'm nuttin nice
Snipe your life on your weddin night
Spoil your fun, been packin the dust since day one
Me and my niggaz stomp you out, gon' win yo' pocket
Yo we steal your funds while you layin there
Stiffen up, to jump in your hoop and count your ones
cuz it's kill or be killed, that's on the real
You get your cap pealed, for tippin the scales
Talk shit, and get your face lift from the fo' fifth
Oh, Crip niggaz flip when Knights step in the door
Ready to snatch your ho
You might catch Knight in the hood
Banged out in khakis and All-Stars
with my little homies on the end of cars bangin North Stars

[Doc Doom]
