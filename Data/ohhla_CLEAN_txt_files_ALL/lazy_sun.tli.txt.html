[The Lonely Island]
Lazy Sunday, wake up in the late afternoon
Call Parnell just to see how he's doin (Hello?)
What up, Parns? (Yo Samberg, what's crackin?)
You thinkin what I'm thinkin? (NARNIA!) Man it's happenin
(But first my hunger pangs are stickin like duct tape)
Let's hit up Magnolia and mack on some cupcakes
(No doubt that bakery's got all the bomb frostings)
I love those cupcakes like McAdams loves Gossling {*echoes*}

(TWO!) No six! (No twelve!) BAKERS DOZEN!
I told you that I'm crazy for these cupcakes, cousin!
(Yo where's the movie playin?) Upper Westside dude
(Well let's hit up Yahoo Maps to find the dopest route!)
I prefer MapQuest (that's a good one too)
Google Maps is the best (true dat) DOUBLE TRUE!
68th to Broadway (step on it sucker)
What'cha wanna do Chris? (SNACK ATTACK MOTHERFUCKER!)

[Chorus]
Hit The Chronic(what?)cles of Narnia
Yes The Chronic(what?)cles of Narnia
We love The Chronic(what?)cles of Narnia
Pass The Chronic(what?)cles of Narnia

[The Lonely Island]
Yo stop at the deli, the theater's overpriced
(You got the backpack?) Gonna pack it up nice
(Don't want security to get suspicious!)
Mr. Pibb and Red Vines equals crazy delicious!
(Yo reach in my pocket, pull out some dough)
Girl acted like she'd never seen a ten befo'
IT'S ALL ABOUT THE HAMILTONS BABY
Throw the snacks in the bag (and I'm a ghost like Swayze)

(Roll up to the theater) ticket buyin, what we're handlin
(You can call us Aaron Burr) from the way we're droppin Hamiltons
(Now parked in our seats, movie trivia's the illest)
What "Friends" alum starred in films with Bruce Willis?
(We answered so fast it was scary)
Everyone stared in awe when we screamed MATTHEW PERRY!
Now quiet in the theater or it's gonna get tragic
(We're about to get taken to a dream world of magic!)

[Chorus]
