Song:   Promiseland
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I remember when my soul, hoes and dough was missin'
When I went to all the shows yo my bros are bitchin
Never meant to blow my goal so its motor spittin
And when I enter all of my flows I'm so in pole position

I promise, to be the best to mom ya
Us through get up at the dawn let tech spew flip it like an omelette
Ever since the calm bet you tech ain't made you yawn yet
All signed checks in my pocket are the color of pawn shrek

The industry never passed the baton guess I grabbed it
If its beyond us even so I get the gauntlet
This music shit was enough to make me vomit
But I kept you all astonished make way for the kc comet

Now I'm winning I'm more sarcastic than vince vaughn yeah
Honestly when I walk in I come off like bomb threats
Cause them don't want tech to go straight non vet
Throw on jets and get all the way to this land that was promised

[Chorus]

Would you let me kiss em couldn't defeat me none
We started beastin em sellin records mellin seconds
Look at us teachin em yellin tech is hell and methods
Rippin and reachin em, felon jeffers tellin heffers

I ain't got no income but I got dough and then some
In come some friends they wanna attend hundreds send em
Knockin em out my chain go side to side just like a pendulum
I'm in to one but the other is impatient waitin for the sin to come

This is what goes on now that I'm in their light
Now they know that I get my flows on they comin' out in their tights
Been chasin this for so long never has been fair fights
Lookin for them rare sights. it's in there right?

In the land where everything is yours
Not fictitious like the boars all delicious like a smoors.
I'm be walking through the doors they often to the stores
Got me bossin doin more for the Promiseland I'm you and yours, nina

[Chorus]

Is this it? is this what it's all about man?
Eating. drinking. fucking. sucking. snorting. come on man.
Meeting. feeling. touching. we on dames.
Killing. busting. really loving us cause we all strange.

Ha ha ha ha ha ha I like it
The Promiseland is real simply because I write it.
Don't stare too long and envy cause you might get eye-ritis
Now to get me for shows and lyrics it's high prices

In Promiseland, I'm gonna stand, an honest man
This honor gets the drama yes the llama can
Bring disaster on rappers like water on japan
He got his chance and tech puts it all on his fans

[Chorus]</pre>
