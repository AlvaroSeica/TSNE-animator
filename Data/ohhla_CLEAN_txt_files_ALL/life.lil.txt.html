Song:   Life
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I learned about myself when I was facing 36
And I really now know when I was caught up in the mix
Everybody thugged life and I didn't even know it
I was out in the hood tryina survive with the homies
But my niggas ain't see me, I had the clique up
I was bossin in the hood, startin to click something
Most niggas from the set, we're running that spec
I prayed all my life, something seem right
Even through all the bad, I made it through those fights
A scape kid nabbin and bullets at night
Baby wasn't tryina fight cause I seen niggas die
It gotta be more than the jail cell fine
Escape 36, hate on nobody
Cause what I went through I wouldn't wish on nobody
Everything I have done, you would've seen at 30
Getting out the cell man, that's way too early
Niggas doin 15, they get time to early
How you do in 30 years? You're not even 30
I pray for the people that shady man looked over
No family support, no friends to come over
Now I can see the anger that you holdin
Nobody taught us, we are men
I was raised by a woman, so my emotions is all in
I got my dad stress, I'm taking it all in
Lil B

I'm a put one in the air for my loved ones

I feel like all the world, the painlike cause
We all make the mistakes but the option is yours
I got it tuned about the drugs in the floor
I gotta get out the game, I don't want no more
I don't want no war
When you're thuggin in game, you'll never win

The police waitin for you and so is the lawyer
It's the DA tryina say your life ain't gorgeous
Paint on my face like I'm in the circus
Suit me up with the circuit, I gotta put work in
A lot of niggas feel worthless when they not workin
Like put stress on you like they do with them curtains
One thing and I am for certain
Don't set down your heart, just keep on learning
Most people never been fucked like they a virgin
It's my life, this is my version
And I wish everything on earth was perfect
But everybody, we are perfect
You gotta love yourself even your plan not workin
And get cut back on your earnings
Most people won't retire, they just keep on servin
Walking down the streets like they do in Berkeley
Gotta keep my eyes open with a based prayer
A lot of things but never be fair
Deal with it, Lil B

I don't know man, rawest rapper alive that's on the set
