[Verse 1]
I'm full of funk, I'm stayin crunk, and Fly ain't barrin no tricks
I'm fillin sweets so full of skunk and then I take me a hit, it's the lick
The ganja mane taking over a playa's brain
Cause fly on that funk, punk, that bud got me hearin thangs
Mane, I'm feelin sane from this place in fly's memory
recalling back fly so high, my visions are blurried, G
Me, myself and I, little Fly gonna take a flight
Whenever it's chronic city, or funkytown late at night
Right, I hit the snow, slammin bones with Lil Frog though
Junkies just 'a comin and yo, I'm yellin dominoes
So, you know it's on, party on to the break of dawn
My body is kinda numb, sometimes I start to yawn
Sippin on the Busch and Boy U Suckaz Can't Hang with me
I blaze up that onion blunt, fly snizow that blizow G
Stretch across the bed, rest me head, then I'm snorin Jones
just awaken shakin once again, now you know it's on..

[Chorus]
Just awaken shakin once again, so you know it's on
Just awaken shakin once again, ho you know it's on..
(Repeat 3x)

[Verse 2]
Playas on the scene, I'm feelin mean, I'm on blow, so
I'm chillin with SPL, Fly down with South Park ho
Yo, the Mitchell Heights, supatight, ready for a flight
For creepin you heavy hoes or breakin you late at night
Flight is how I lay when I'm blowin my bloody hay
Fuck what you gotta say, and that's the way Fly gone stay
Hey, my nigga Slick in the house for the nickel bitch
Lil Thai and Big Jugg in this click, gangstaz runnin shit
Trick, he'll let you know when he roasted that lemon lame
He got that boy hot as fuck and Fly never seen a mane
shakin like a duck, scared as fuck, that's the way he be
Tony, Bone, Larry yall, let's go and just smoke him G
MHP, SPV, SPL down with me
I blow up Paul's ana piece just like it's a pack of P
See, it's here so quick, take a hit, then the shit is gone
Just awaken shakin, once again so you know it's on

[Chorus] (Repeat 3x)

[Verse 3]             
Fly so high and funkytown, major blunts I gotta smoke
Snortin, Sneezin, Coughin Chiefin, Blowin heavy holy dope
Playa's fuckin blessed by that funk, crunk by onion weed
Don't you think you're higher than Lil Fly, till you snort that P
P-Funk got me goin, ho I'm blowin on Montana's pack
Blizunts put me under, but that Snizow put me back on track
Bustaz blinded by my smoke, how you like my Smokers Screen
Playa got that evil grin and Tony got me lookin mean
Fly got Swishers full of blink, time to snort that white ho bitch
Then she tell me Fly don't need it, but Fly said mane FUCK THAT BITCH
Suckaz fear my atmosphere, ho you should not open your ear
Groupie bitches hypnotized by devil shit you hate to hear.
Standin in a shower, full of powder, coc a fuckin caine
Hour by the hour, ain't no coward, cause I'm blowin mane
If you say I'm sprung, body numb, Playa, Zeek and Fly
Funkytown, Fly boundin and now I know you know I'm really high

Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch

[Repeat chorus till end of song]</pre>
