[Mala Machenko - singing]
Why waaaait?...
Kill yourself noooooooow

[L.E.G.A.C.Y.]
Uh, kill yourself!
Uh, Suicide...Music
Khyrsis..uh, L.E.G....
Let's...go...

You'll need more than that if you really wanna stop me
The greatest, nickname Muhammad Ali
Rope these dopes, with hope I float
You, sink so slow, must have a hole in your boat
Ships Ahoy then your, ship's destroyed
Titanic mistake, better get ya boy
One more wrong move, that'll be your next fate
One more wrong move, that'll be checkmate
Uh, your king's down and, your team's down and
your queen's down for anything now
She movin al-ways, I screwed her all ways
Switch up, switch downs, Dig Dug the bitch out!
Shuffle in the air like Norman in "Psycho"
Fuck it, I don't care, I'm more than psycho
The arrow points to me, 'cause no one is greater than
If you don't agree - well, you're a hater then

[Chorus]
I've been some other place, I've touched some other races
I've seen some other faces, I've beat some other cases
I know it's entertainment, I gotta make a statement
Fuck it, I gotta say it - I am the fucking greatest

[Dasan Ahanu]
Shattering midnight with a blink of an eye
Laugh as I reach and pull a shard from the sky
Cut into your conscience, but you drip from within
Write this verse with your blood, who the FUCK needs a pen?!

[L.E.G.A.C.Y.]
As sure as the sky's blue, as sure as shit stinks
I'm sippin bi-racial, that means they mixed drinks
Twisty-tied, deliver me from haters
Feel me, I am the epitome of greatness
Fuck other feelings, nothing's greater than hate
The, fuckin feeling ain't L.E.G.-xander the Great
Overthrowin better than me when I'm speaking
Yeah, and I smoke weed for medical reasons, huh
I'm the brimstone, I'm the last fire
I done bent hoes, like I'm Quagmire
Over counter-tops, cars and furniture
Outside the box, the bars of a murderer
Killed every verse, beatin rapper in front of me
But, still curse, they can't stand honesty
And y'all wait great as the wall, you can tell
In Scarface, "I take you all to fuckin Hell" - HAH!

[Chorus]

[Dasan Ahanu]
Born in the bellows of lyricism
Draped in Heaven but drenched in Hell
Each, metaphor to sky wars
Each similies to earthquakes to
modern-day mythology of L.E.G.-olas the Great!</pre>
