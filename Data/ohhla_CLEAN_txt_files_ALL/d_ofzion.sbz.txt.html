[Intro: Shabazz the Disciple]
Aha... daughters of Zion, harlots be spying
Word, daughters of Zion, that hell fire up in the womb
STD's

[Chorus 2X: Shabazz the Disciple]
Girl, why you daughter of Zion?
The mighty wicked daughter of Zion
I said you leave the black mama crying
Her son upon her deathbed dying

[Shabazz the Disciple]
Yo, I journey thorugh the wilderness, searching for the queen
Keep ending up with these Isaiah 3:16's
They naughty, they haughty, they eyes are wanton
Her wickedness increase her lavishness, daughters of Zion
She loves diamonds in her jewelry, wears fine linens and minks
But then she'll come to passing, sweet smells shall be stink
No longer queen of the castle, her crown tarnish to rust
A widow laming at her gate while she sits in the dust
I crown the 31-10 proverbs not the harlots
They lay with strangers for the sheckles in they wallets
She has a golden cup that's full of her abomination
That running from folk, with an abundance of a fornication
She has the presence of an angel, but her state of mind is morbid
She rump look like two planets shaking in the orbit
The type of wisdom that'll end up in the poor house
Not Moorehouse, full of sugs in the whore house

[Chorus 2X]

[Shabazz the Disciple]
No need for say ya name, you lay upon the bed of flames
It's a shame, she tell him have a grip pon ya brain
Right upon the wicked man fruit, you out of be ashamed
Girl, sexy for loot
She need the black mind of them wearing black suit
No longer purified, girl, you soul been dilute
She let the devil trick her in the garden
Now she want to beg and to pardon
The queen of clubs, hanging, playing scarring
It's the most high you been disregarding
They dressed in gold ornaments and tight trausers
Floating in tight skirts and short blouses
They love it when the rich man browses
Lust arouses, they on them houses
So she can lick him with diseases
Girl why you try to lick me with diseases?
I said the most dangerous diseases
I'm talking bout the mental menengitis
She the one with the HIV virus
Lord, daughters of Zion

[Chorus 2X]

[Shabazz the Disciple]
Your riches turn to rags, and your crown to skabs
She brags, about the men she put in bodybags
Lay upon your bed full of swords
She once was a queen now she dwell amongst the whores
Her men all ride the sword, and they mind be hitting it raw
No longer royalty, now she dwells amongst the poor
She sings a song of lust, crawling on her belly eating dust
Fell off her throne, now she sits in the dust
The harlot who sits on many waters
Making Gods, sons and daughters
Then rotten 'em like death and divorces
She been with them, so many wicked loses
The one you read about in the scriptures
Makes you wanna turn ya back on your sisters
She winks her eyes and blows deadly kisses
Solistics, her hands ain't in wish list

[Chorus II 2X: Shabazz the Disciple]
Girl, why you daughter of Zion
The queen inside the castle who be spying
The sneaky spider web, daughter of Zion
Ghetto Medusa, the seducer of a lion</pre>
