[Intro]
Chaka Zulu, Chak, Chaka Zulua. Oh, yeah, ooh. Check it

[Verse One]
We used to roll through Inglewood bumping The Beasties
Dana Dane on repeat 'till the tape deck deceased
Me, my brother Carlo, bTwice and Ern Brn
Singing "You must learn"
Turned the same corner thousands of times
Thousands of crimes petty but still we jetty
Thousands of rhymes in our minds until we caught a headache
Those were the days these are the nights I'm afraid
To say it I hang them in my heart save them for a rainy day

[Chorus]
Beastie Boys, Dana Dane and JJ Fad
Oh it kinda make me sad
Because oh we growin' old
Oh we growin' old oh we growin' old
Fats Boys, "Beat Street" and Kangol hats
Oh it kinda makes me sad
Because oh we growin' old
Oh we growin' old oh we growin' old

[Verse Two]
Way back in 1989 before hip hop had perks
The girls had "I Love Daisies" on their shirts and it worked
With me falling in love with the whole scene with a dream
That I'd rock the stage and do the same dang thing
Ties hanging from the pants everybody had dreadlocks
Back then light skinned niggas ruled the whole block
We rocked polka dots gangstas wore Guess with house shoes
Without a care with nothing to lose come on

[Chorus]
De La Soul, JB's and A Tribe Called Quest
Man we didn't know what we missed
Oh we growin' old oh we growin' old
Oh we growin' old
3rd Bass, Special Ed and KRS
Years ahead all of the rest
Oh we growin' old oh we growin' old
Oh we growin' old
The Pharcyde, Souls Of Mischief and the Wu Tang Clan
Oh we didn't have a plan
Oh we growin' old oh we growin' old
Oh we growin' old
The Freestyle Fellowship and MC Shan
The wind blew away the sand
Because oh we growin' old oh we growin' old
Oh we growin' old

[Verse Three]
I once had the whole world
And all the time in the land
The mountains high and the valleys low
I never planned
That it would leak right through my hand
And I guess it's too late to know

B-boys B-girls
Be boys be girls good night</pre>
