Typed by: AZ Lyrics

What you doing here?
Girl who let you in here?
Can I whisper in your ear, cuz I really need you near?
And my mom said you couldn't come over, didn't really care when you pulled up in the rover
Said that I should wait, wait 'til I got older, love is the one and baby I'm your shoulder
(swag)
At the crib like you here to see Willow, everybody know that you here to see Smitto
Willow been in Philly for the past couple weeks, she just chillin' with Gammy cuz she really love the east
But I'm in Cali where the sun come
The city of angels and trust me baby, you're one of em
Upcoming artist?
I'm sorry, I don't know none of em,
Misfit tee, I'm sorry hun if you wanted one
(uh)
I'm just playing you can have it
Most schools should check it though we got it
Don't worry girl, you can swag it
I'mma look down?
Sorry girl that's a habit
Your body is so round, you make me wanna come grab it
People say my lyrics are explicit, but really their just vivid
Cuz when I hang with you I'm always thinking about kissin
And my house is like a heaven, I'd love for you to come visit
And listen to the smooth track, aye girl get yo dude back
Man, why you go and do that?
Get up in my face and you ruin the mood
Oh jeez
Told the girl don't worry, I can get them gone I just have to tell siri
The security came running through the halls in a hurry
Took them so fast, it was almost kind of blurry
See ooh girl, why you looking so fly?
You the baddest no lie
Wanna get in my room, I knew you were gonna try but before you acting all shy
And I think I know why
(why why why why...)
Girl I think I know why
(why why why why...)
Girl I got what you need, come take if you want
Girl come make it if you want
I don't care what you wear, come if you want
Even though I couldn't say it it's basically what I want So.
I'm just bugging girl
But the funny part is you know that I wasn't, girl
I'm just really lonely, I need someone's loving girl
And you make me so hot and that's why it feels like an oven girl
And I think I know why Uh girl, why you lookin so fly? (so fly)
You the baddest, no lie
I wanna get in my room
I knew you was gon try
But before you was actin' all shy I think I know why (why why why..)
Girl, I think I know why (why why why..)
Girl, I think I know why
Aye girl Feel up your room right now
Listen to this song I'm right there with you
Just let me hold you
Take my hand
Just rock with me
Girl, just rock with.
Uh girl, why you lookin so fly? (so fly)
You the baddest, no lie I wanna get in my room

You the baddest, no lie I wanna get in my room I knew you was gon try
But before you was actin' all shy I think I know why (why why why..)
Girl, I think I know why (why why why..)
Girl, I think I know why
Put your head up on my shoulder
Girl I'm bout to kiss you
Yea, that's what I told her
So we getting close, only getting closer
And I'm waiting for the kiss til I said âhold upâ I'm ok that you are older
I just need you on my side when I'mma roll up in that Bentley
And these jockers just resent me
When you met me I was empty
And I'm bout to win a Grammy and these jockers wanna friend me but I'm gone now</pre>
