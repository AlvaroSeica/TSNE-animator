I swag
Just Lil B blaze got bitch
Pink flame hoe
Shout up to mothafuckers

My bitch suck dick so I never kiss her
Call me mister base God, bitch I ain't that nigga
Out in my desktop, talking next to
Shaking ass like a mothafucking knock hell
Bitch look like she offer magazine
Bitch I don't know what I'm talking about I'm bout green
Eyes pull up, on the mothafucking scene
I'm still smoking weed, I' still servign green
Came on the block and they know about me
Call me Mr. Man with the many pour teens
Active load and it's never me
Call me a bitch 'cause it's money on me

I really got the man I'm a new school gangsta
Old as niggas that they game player
When I turn forty I'm just still get...
When I turn sixty I'm a pull around twenty
1A7, my swag is murder, you know about base God
Guess I heard of, I'm a show you boys about the glock in the burner
I'm a show the girls that Lil B...
Stop it, okay?
I'm a myth, I'm a copy... with the blaze, on their wips
And I might here to seitch
You felt the shouts to LA what it is?
Hey, Kay, we know what it is?
Uh, I'm a tell niggas like this
Shouts out to Texas nigga, okay I'm thuggin' in Texas

I'm a Texas thug, Lil B based God</pre>
