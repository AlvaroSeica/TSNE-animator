THE BRIGHT LIGHTS, AND BIG CITY!
THE BRIGHT LIGHTS, AND BIG CITY!
THE BRIGHT LIGHTS, AND BIG CITY!
THE BRIGHT LIGHTS, AND BIG CITY!

[Jim Jones]
This is a dream of a hustler (like a nightmare!)
I had the butter and the fiends was in love with us (that Fishscale!)
We copped the gutta, not a team that could fuck with us! (Dipset!)
And word to mother keep the thing in every truck with us
Now I was fronting like Rich was, and some of my bit-ches
Was going so hard, got some of us sick thugs (SNAGZ!)
And minor setbacks got some of us tripped up but...
The guns we done gripped up so we coming to get ya!
And fuck the local authorities (fuck em!), and hope the big boys don't pick up my case
Cause for these big toys and these chips, we get chased! (balling!)
Playing ball just like the Orioles to get to 1st base
But the....goons on 2nd, bust on 3rd (WATCH IT!)
You know they....move with the weapons, get bucks off birds (iT'S CRAZY OUT HERE!)
It's like I'm playing Chicken with my life
Tryna get this paper moving pitches for a price

[Max B: Hook]
WE COME TO RIDE OUT WITH THEM NIGGAZ BABY WE GETTING FIGURES
IT'S BYRD GANG......WE DOING IT BIIIIIG
BUT WE TOWERED UP, GET THE REMY I'LL GET A CUP.....YOU SLIPPIN GOOD, CAN I GET A SQUEEEEEZE
I DON'T THINK YOU WANT IT WITH THEM NIGGAZ
CAUSE THEM HAMMERS THEY WONT HESISTATE TO SQUEEZE
WE ON THE ROAD, TRAVEL CROSS THE GLOBE.....ALL MY HOMIES UP WITH THIS GETTING CHEEEEEESE

[Jim Jones]
Look....the nightmares of a trap star (SCAAARY!)
With white tees, Nike air's and my fast car (CRUUUUSING!)
D.A tryna wrap me in the charge
But I just bought some V's and a pack in my garage
Now....me rapping what's the odds?
We the last crew standing....DIPLOMATS NOW IN CHARGE!
Now.....300 for the light show
Another hundred on the hand to watch the ice glow
Another 10 grand to watch the dice roll
Trying to let you motherfuckers see this how my life go (THIS IS REAL SHIT!)
The bright lights and this big city
I'ma live the nightlife until the pigs get me
Range Rove'ing, Big Truck Series
The chain frozen, big chunk jewelry
White girls say he's all semi cool
But you don't want to cost him cause he got a short fuse

[Hook]

[Jim Jones]
We live life on reality
And we flip white for a salary
You might catch us at the light in the lavish V
But watch them "Blue &amp; Whites" try and grab a G
Making some chips so the hate's getting thick (I FEEL IT!)
Watch the world through my tint, smoking haze in the whip (THAT PURRRRPLEEE!)
Contemplate, maybe take a little trip
Ocean Drive heavy glean in my necklace
Call up cabs, rushing drinks out of "Wet Willies"
"Eu Seuy O Balling" but y'all foolish
Getting locked up for crimes and ya lawyer's ain't Jewish! (STUUUUUUUUUPID!)
That's why I keep the Turnie's on the tainer
Cause everytime I turn I'm getting chained up
They say what they want to search, tryna tame us
I think they mad we from the turf and we dangerous
AND MY WHOLE CREW ICEY WE PLAYING HOCKEY LIKE THE RANGERS
