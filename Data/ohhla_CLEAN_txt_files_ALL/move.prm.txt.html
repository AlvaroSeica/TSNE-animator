Dear Lij, little man, little bear
You'll soon realize sometimes life isn't fair
Like how I'd be there, then all a sudden disappear
And leave your mother to explain why I wasn't there
No matter what, I couldn't word it right
I felt like coward undeserving of your light
and that smile you possess and that trusting gaze
that gave shivers to my flesh I'll take that image to my death
I know, you learn the lessons that you need to
Kind of surreal that I will not help teach you
Sorry that your father never bothered
And I'm the closest figure that you had since you were a toddler
This is hard to write but even harder to accept
That you are gone from my life
Now I father this regret, and I guess... that we all know, this is for the best
And I'm sorry...
I took that piece of your mother's heart
Best it's best that she learns to use another part
And Now I I you'll understand when you're older
and if you have extra weight that I've placed upon my shoulders
And still running round these countries
Still chasing bumblebees
Still missing your company
That's it for now buddy, I gotta run
I just pray the next man earns the right to call you "son"

Chorus (2X)

And I'm gone...
Is this what you'e used to?
Could never stand still always move
To form a path anew
Don't Want God to forgive me I hope that you do

Dear.... well
You didn't have a name or a gender
My calculations had you due Mid to Late November
I try to dismember your memory but i'll never forget see I will always remember
Me and your Mother spent a couple nights together 
Far from a couple who spoke about  spending  life together
I'll recall that phone call forever
I was hit with a stone wall of sudden cold weather
I got pale...
And everything went black
And I wished for nothing more than to take night back but..
What been done, beens done
And now it's  will I have a daughter? will I have a son?
Or will we even keep it ?
Either way the verdict had me stunned
And all it took was a trip to the ATM
To end your life before it ever began
My friends tell me don't cry cause the milk's been spilt
But when I sleep I'm covered w. my guilt like a quilt 
But instead of down feathers.....the weight feels more like steel
And it wasn't my decision 
Ultimately it's the womens
But I could of done so much more 
Instead of planning for your life, I was planning a tour
And now the guilt crashed down on my sanity's shore
I can't ask forgiveness, you never got a life
I can only I hope and pray I get the next part right.
They say you never formed a heart beat
but that don't mean my heart don't bleed

Chorus (2X)

And I'm gone...
Is this what you'e used to?
Could never stand still always move
To form a path anew
Don't Want God to forgive me I hope that you do

Now...
It seems to me everyone things you changed
I know the truth 
You're exactly the same
You're still scared of your future
Longing for your youth
Scared of the suture 
to stitch up the wound
So you grab your shit 
Ready to bounce, split
Pick up and move
You say you left the drugs  behind
But what about that other time
You're not a recovering addict
Your just an addict with a gift for uncovering passion
Perhaps I'm being too harsh man
But I've always been your worst critic Mark, damn.
Sometimes I admit that I'm proud
But that same pride makes that admission not allowed
But let's face it... you're not that complicated
You just never learned to practice moderation
Matter fact, your conditions rather classic
You want the fellas to respect you the girls to be attracted
You only want everyone to hear you
To live your life forever and the world to revere you
And I respect that, I dig the approach
So i'll keep pushing till they bury us both
But just remember... when you're at the next show
I know where you been 
And I control where you go</pre>
