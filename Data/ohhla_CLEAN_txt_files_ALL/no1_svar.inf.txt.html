[Cham]
1991
I'm that dude you see hanging around the town
You can call me a greaseball if you like the way it sounds
Is it a smile on your lips turned upside down
Or is it the ugliest frown in this goddamn town
I know your parents worn you about people like me
I know you ain't stupid girl, just open your eyes and see
If you wanna take my hand I can show you what our life could really be
'Cause people like us loves a big family, Yeah!

[Rodde a.k.a Rigorod]
I don't wanna be the one you like!
I don't wanna be the one you talk about!
All I wanna be is the No1 Swartskalle!

[Cham]
I ride a train
I ride a metro everyday
I see the sun kiss the dirty windows everyday
Look at me wearing jeans, sneakers and a hat
Baby girl this is what I know and how I act, Yeah!

[Rodde a.k.a Rigorod] (Cham)
I don't wanna be the one you like! (No, I don't wanna)
I don't wanna be the one you talk about! (No, I don't wanna)
All I wanna be is the No1 Swartskalle!

Yo! Hey, hey!

I don't wanna be the one you like! (No, I don't wanna)
I don't wanna be the one you talk about! (No, I don't wanna)
All I wanna be is the No1 Swartskalle!</pre>
