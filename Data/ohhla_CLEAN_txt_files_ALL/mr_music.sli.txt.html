Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Play on Mr. Music
Play on
Play on Mr. Music
Play on
But give it to me lord
Mr. Music
You know it sure sounds good to me
It's just the feelin' I know that
You can't refuse
I say now what have you got to be
Say there's a riot in the city tonight
Everybody
People come no fuss no fight
Said there's a riot in the city tonight
Everybody
People come no fuss no fight
He tell me
Play on Mr. Music
Play on
Play on Mr. Music
Play on
Well if ya never knew
That givin up's such an easy thing to do
Say people don't cha know what's right
Right
And when i'm reaching for my sun
That be in the sky
You know my heaven's coming down tonight
He tell me
Play on, Mr. Music
Play on
Play on, Mr. Music
Play on
But if you listen raggamuffin
Don't cha 'ere what i'm sayin to ya
Every little thing okay
And when I wake up in the morning
And i'm feeling fine
You know i'm loving everything today
We got to
You know we got to get together one more time
To stand up for our rights
And if you're livin for the life of the simple man
You best stand ground before ya put up a fight
He tell me
Play on Mr. Music
Play on
Play on Mr. Music
Play on
The keyboard, __
He tell me
Play on Mr. Music
Play on
Play on Mr. Music
Play on</pre>
