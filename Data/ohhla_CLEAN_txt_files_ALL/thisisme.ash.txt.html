I'm sayin..first heard this, I was like, 'this is me'
We got Asheru.. 'This is ME!'

[beat comes on]
[softly] Ill Will, Earthquake
         Goes a little somethin like this...

Aiyyo my man got me wide, I'm listenin to beats inside the ride
I put my love in so when you drivin down the street
And you got this beat on, it's hot 'cause the heat on
And if you got that fat shit, then put repeat on
I pop your ass like a clutch, to get you started
My man farted and the whole crowd parted
You know my shit is so together, I carry clever across the cleft
Like soundwaves and ravage in his chest
It's not a matter of bein wack or not
It's about - who got your back when shit gets hot
In the crowds, I'm cultivatin props, I grow rocks
And stock breaks, manipulate the art and create
See, when I first started my heart was in the right place
Then they changed the game and I still kept pace
So now I'm in the place, and I'm in the house, and I'm comin back
You know this nigga's name--Blue Black

Walk in, at the party, see who's spinnin, was some nigga
Are you high or wide, I'm just dolo lookin fly
Ghetto-pretty in the city of lights
And the ass out, finger-poppin hips and lips
Lookin way past, sweat her, 'cause I can't let her know I want her
So I lounge a look lost, cost effective?
When it's time to ante up, panties up her ass
So tight, I need a rinse to work a nut off
C?? freezin?, while I'm seizin silhouettes
Let's wallow in the wetness--Check this
I been a b-boy before I been away, but the b in me'll never go away
I'll stow away on a ship, I'll seal my lips ? and escape
You know- I create funk flow
'Cause I'm not caught up, I thought of a way to speak and spoke:
The Unspoken Heard is no joke

[everyone talking]

Yo, I glaze from purple haze to daze and amazin phrases
I'm thinkin bout money 'cause it pays
So is you is, or is you ain't an entertainer?
I'm a writer, or retainer?, I make art like a painter
I represent the remnant, the remainder
I don't know how to make this point plainer
But brothas who supposed to be, I was hostin a show
I wasn't s'posed to be, lookin at this brotha close to me
And even he wasn't who he was supposed to be
So I'm trapped in the circle (just trapped in the circle)
I'm very present in the room I'm in
Presentin ill rhythms when the track begin
It gets me open and my rhyme falls in, but even ?? times
See I'm not complainin but the shit is dreamin
The game face kid - entertainin - the world is a show
You d'know? See you got to show and tell to get to go
So I create this energy, this synergy.
[simultaneuous rhyming] It's above and beyond me, it's on me
     I make it since it's so divine, more sublime
     Surrounded by mendacity, but yo, that's the time
And every time I present, the present tense is tension
But that wasn't even mind's intention.. DC!!

[Ill Will kicks an amazing freestyle]</pre>
