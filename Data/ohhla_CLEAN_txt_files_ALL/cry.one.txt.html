She was a smart girl but never came to finish 
her school Disobeying what she used to call 
the sinister rules The minister knew, they 
grew one special bondage
An overly calm kid but haunted!
13 and good her belly started to bust, cold crush
No one to trust, that's why she kept it on the hush...
Yo, six months passed: robbed off her smile
She had to go down south to give birth to a child.
We lost touch, one day coming back from tour
Everybody bugging, guess who just move next door
Saw her frame buying pampers at the grocery-store
Try to front like she really don't know me no more
Played it off no sweat god forgive why try
Every now and then, a hi and bye bye
My man Pete, always see her twisted in clubs
Shaking them thangs for Chris', only kick it with thugs
Who would really be surprised if she dipped into drugs
The word got around that she be pimping her love
Simply because, that's what her misery does
Constantly trying to find a way to bigger her buzz
Few months ago, she met this big-time baller
That's when the real shit started off..

Chorus:
All I've known is pain and sorrow in my life, 
please don't let me cry
Today I've learned to love tomorrows of my life, 
please don't let me cry
And all the things that I've been through
Just kept my pride and I stayed true, 
please don't let me cry, please don't let me cry

Killer was well known for slinging bricks of cocaine
Two gambling spots, pushing tricks with code-names
The type with gold chains, a bully with bad taste
A mad face, quick to get your ass laced...
Deep in her heart she needed a father figure
Blind to the fact what's got her problems triggered
Seeking reflections in bottles of Hennessy
Re-evaluating her sorrows and tendencies,
Neglecting her own on the phone smoking bones
What's all that noise coming out of her broken home?
Domestic violation, pain isolation
You won't find no answers being patient
Writing predicaments for whole generations
It's not a battle, (what?) annihilation!</pre>
