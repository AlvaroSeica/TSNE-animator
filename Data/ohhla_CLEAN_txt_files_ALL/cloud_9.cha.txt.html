[Intro: Chamillionaire]
Comin down clean, like I'm coastin on cloud nine
Cloud nine, I ride, so cleeeeean
Hol' up, some people don't like me
Must be cause I'm ridin so clean
Like I'm coastin on cloud nine
Cloud nine, I ride, so cleeeeean
Hol' up, some people don't like me
Must be cause I'm ridin so clean
Like I'm coastin on cloud nine
Cloud nine, I ride, so cleeeeean

[Chamillionaire]
I know, I'm a master at chick removal but I never trick cause I'm livin frugal
You a boss that ain't got a boss then these bossy people don't get to rule you
See it's normally business as usual, never needed no one's approval
But it ain't none of they information, want that they need to take a trip to Google
Pick her up, now your boo is missin, tellin me I'm her new addiction
Ladies lovin my old school, got me feelin like New Edition
Maybe I should go buy another one just so I can have a new addition
I would let 'em all count 'em up but y'all know my haters never knew addition
I ain't into no superstition, I'm just into new coupes with stitchin
No degree but you'll notice we done spent more today than your school admission
Got the money then ladies came and they'd swear to God that I'd lose my vision
But that's somethin you'll never see, like a Hindu Muslim and Jewish Christian

[Chorus: Chamillionaire]
Ooooh ooh, hol' up
Some people don't like me, those people don't matter to me
(No they don't really) Don't faze me, don't faze me (matter to me)
Some people don't like me, must be cause I'm ridin so clean
Like I'm coastin on cloud nine - hol' up
Some people don't like me, those people don't matter to me
(No they don't really) Don't faze me, don't faze me (matter to me)
Some people don't like me, don't matter
I'll always beeeeeeeeee on cloud nine

[Chamillionaire]
You got gossip talk you can't wait to text, I got contracts I can't wait to fax
That's why I got her so steamy she should jump in my pool and go take some laps
Taught you losers how to get the chips, these losers like, "I can't relate to that"
If you woulda listened when I taught you that then you mental midgets woulda made the stacks
Just admit it, you were born a hater, if you're tryin to say that I shouldn't have it
I'm ridin spokes and if ya not a broke and not takin notes then get a basic Tablet
Got her sittin on special fabric, she lookin like she just left a pageant
She in the whip, inspectin gadgets while you watchin us like Inspector Gadget
Don't hold ya breath because I know ya waitin, the city's somethin I'm overtakin
Captain Savers go call the pigs but I dissapear before they get the bacon
Not a hero, you're so mistaken, if you're Superman then just throw ya cape in
Cause the villain's back and I'm givin that, young multi-millionaire motivation

[Chorus]

[Chamillionaire - screwed]
Some people don't like me, got to be cause I'm ridin clean
Got to be cause I'm comin down, poppin trunks with them shinin beams
Showin up and she show me love, showin up in her private dreams
Got her treatin me like a king

[Chorus]
