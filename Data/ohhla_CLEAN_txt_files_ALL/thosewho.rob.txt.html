[Lil' Rob]
(Verse 1)
Why must it be like this
All of the time, time
I feel like I'm, I'm
Goin' out of my mind, mind
Someone stop me
Nuh-huh, nuh-huh
Leave me alone
In a class of my own, ladies wanna
Simon, they wanna bone
Creased up with caglone, the terror leave my home
Twenty three year old pelon
Good to die for
Vocal tones
My boots were make for stompin' while by beats were made for bumpin'
Ain't no frontin'
Always into somethin', known to shoot, can't tell me nothin'
My mind is somethin' you can bet that I won't let
Nothing get
In my way
Lil' Rob, here to stay
But it won't stay this way, that's what you say
Ok
Ponle
Orale (Orale...)
Orale (Orale...)
Hurry up (Hurry up...)
Do what you gotta do, so that you can pass me
You tried Plan A, it didn't work (Work...)
Time for Plan B
Or maybe it just can't be
You're trying to be just like me
It strikes me
Kind of odd
You yappin' shit about
Lil' Rob

Chorus: Lil' Rob
Can it be
I be the only one that knows them rules, all these fools keep
Yappin', wanted me to yap too
Can it, can it be
I be the only one that knows them rules, all these fools keep
Yappin', wanted me to yap too
Can it, can it be
I be the only one that knows them rules, all these fools keep
Yappin', wanted me to yap too, but it won't happen
Those who know
Don't talk (Don't talk...)
And those who talk
Don't know (Don't know...)

(Verse 2)
Why must it be like this
Everyday (Everyday...)
Cause everyday's (Cause everyday's...)
The same old way
Hey, dawg, you heard the story
Comes with the territory
Now homie
Break it down for me
Here's my testimony
Little vato gets some fame, people starting to know his name
Now everybody wants to know what barrio does he claim
Because he's got the new shit
The true shit
Not the bullshit
Got his finger on the trigger
And he's not afraid to pull it
Twenty three
With a bullet
Oh miss, you need to cool it
Call it quits (Call it quits...)
Cause I fight back like David Hobowitz
I got the wits to make the hits
And rush 'em fool just like a bitch
Lil' Rob, hot up in the mix
With my flips
Make it last longer like a flick
Come on me close, so take your pick
Got more tricks than a magician
Fuck with me, homie keep on wishin' (Wishin'...)
It's that vato that you keep on dissin' (Dissin'...)
Sshhh
Stop, look and listen

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 3)
Why must it be like this
Every night (Every night...)
The dogs bark loud, but it's the quiet dog that bites
What
Does it take
For me to make
Everything
Happening (Happening...)
I got more bounce than a trampoline
What you tellin' me
That you loved me just like family
I'm not buying
Whatever it is you're sellin' me
You're, killin' me
With your jealousy and fantasy
Take you where you wanna be
Then abandon me
What you handin' me
Temporary
Insanity
Never understandin' me
God damnit me
Testin' the fucking man in me
But I won't let your plan succeed
Frantic situation
But I cannot frantically
It seems practically, everybody is out to get me
Or is it just me hallucinating, trippin' over the things that I see
You gotta be kiddin' me
Homie, who told you so
Those who know don't talk (Don't talk...)
And those who talk don't know (Don't know...)

Repeat Chorus</pre>
