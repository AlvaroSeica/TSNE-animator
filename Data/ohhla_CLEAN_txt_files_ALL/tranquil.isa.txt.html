[Intro: Isaiah Rashad]
Well, thank God for the shooter, hmm, and thank God for the leader, hm
And think hard for a message, blink hard on pedestrians, what are you, a believer?
We're tranquil for a Brutus, hey, and hard road for a Ceasar, hey
Well, who came from the heavens? They killed for a blessin', they gon' do it to Jesus, hm
And thank God for the shooters

[Isaiah Rashad]
Them hard streets make a militant man
Fuck a bitch, be as real as you can
Our education, they tend to say we killers again
But I'd rather give this livin' a chance, I'm gettin' patience
I wonder if the world is gon' see us, it's just niggas
They treat lyrics like I hold triggers like I make difference
Then downplay, what I'm given like I'm no different
It make me wanna move to my aunt's house
I've been on pills since a little one...
Start with Advil then we level up...
I wonder if my son gon' trust me, after songs so ugly
'Bout his moms, ain't mean to see the world so crummy
They got.. Tec-9's for Jesus
So I figured that the second coming, was never comin'
Go figure heaven is a hassle cause
They don't even want a nigga back in Africa

[Chorus: Isaiah Rashad]
Well thank God for the shooter, hmm, and thank God for the leader, hm
And think hard for a message, blink hard on pedestrians, what are you, a believer?
We're tranquil for a Brutus, hey, and hard road for a Ceasar, hey
Well, who came from the heavens? They killed for a blessin', they gon' do it to Jesus, hm
Well thank God for the shooter, yeah, and thank God for the leader, hm-mm-mmm
And think hard for a message, blink hard on pedestrians, what are you, a believer? Hm
We're tranquil for a Brutus, and hard road for a Ceasar, yeah
Well, who came from the heavens? They killed for a blessin', they gon' do it to Jesus, hm
And thank God for the shooters

[Isaiah Rashad]
And some of us fall, and some of us hover
And some of us shooters, and some of us lovers
I see the sum of it all, I'm runnin' for cover
Invite you for supper, but really they hunt you
What's really 300? Who's really a gangster?
Was really the prey, was really in danger
I'm willin' to pray, I'm feelin' the angels
Is liquor the savior? This moment will contain us
And ride to the far side, I'm lookin' for peace
Just spread the cigar wide, a moment of ease
Hard benches for my brothers that be roamin' the streets
We don't always be the leaders that they want us to be
I'm just hopin' that she prayin' while she down on her knees
See I often treat these hoes like their fathers would be
Good Lord, my flaws
Blind you, got you time for, my flaws

[Chorus]</pre>
