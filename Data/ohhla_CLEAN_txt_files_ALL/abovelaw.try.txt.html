Song:   Above the Law
Typed by: rev_leonard@hotmail.com

Yeah this song is dedicated in memory of mister Terell Alfago Davis
Mister Davis was gunned down at the hands of two Richmond County 
Sheriff's Department officers down here in Augusta, Georgia
My nigga I'ma tell yall just like this
them motherfuckers thank they some god damn bullies
But until we get wit they ass they gone continue to bully us around 
and now all my niggaz done gone above the law

All my niggaz above the law
All my niggaz above the law <repeat>

Why the fuck these niggaz fuckin with us, we ain't do nothin
All these pussy motherfuckers, they just be bustin
I gets the cussin the fuck, cuz I, I gives a fuck
And then they lock a nigga up, disorderly conduct
And my luck ain't even left yet they done stuck my niggaz up
Guess they didn't know that we didn't give a fuck
Yeah above the law, yuck my dope off in my jaw
soon as I saw em
My so-called nigga fronted, but I would throw em
out like three strikes, so tight he claim to be
While laughin in my face this nigga was framin me
I guess he didn't see KD and Greg watchin
On the roof trippin on three, my niggaz poppin
Droppin like bad habits while smokin a sack of cabbage
Pass the fuckin kid, sevem shots to his wig
Nigga see what you did and you brought it on yourself
Don't ever try to stop no hustlers wealth
You fuckin chump, jump and get yo' ass stopped (WE AIN'T PLAYIN)
The motherfuckin crime scene, we ain't stayin
Relayin, what happened at nine o'clock
By twelve we gettin blowed off at the spot
We chop the Remyiits V.S. to O.P.
Very Soon Opportunities are Plenty
Fools trippin drankin on some bull, fill up my cup
Get the thankin bout them phony bitches, that stood me up
Test my luck, but I was never lucky
It took some triple gold D's for them hoes to fuck me
So fuck them, Braves hat with the crooked brim
I know I'm blessed as I'm dodgin them fuckin NARC'S
Nowhere to rest
That bullet proof vest protect they chest, not they head
One shot to them bastards temple, them niggaz dead
It was said I'm a lunitic
But I'll be damned if I put up wit some stupid shit
Cuz I'm above the law

(chorus)

One of my partners got caught with half a key
Since them crackers knew we was friends they askin me
Like I know, askin me the place to go to get this blow
and makin all kind of threats, like I'm gon' show
The flashlight gave a glow all in face
They askin me about this dope or catch a case
They askin me about the place, I can't remember
Me and him ain't made no moves since last December
Then I tucked a gram in my Timberland boot
Went the tieing up my shit, told em don't shoot
A group of these motherfuckers, aproachin swiftly
Hands on they fuckin gun, as if they really
was bout to take a nigga off, didn't look good
Then I thought about the shit, and knocked on wood
Now would they find this dope hidden off in my shoe
And if they did find the shit, what would they do
I knew that I was fucked up no where to run
All I saw was was Walter waitin,four "0" one
A Richmond County jail, ahh hell naw
Just that quick that my niggaz gone have that y'all
We bustin at all coppers, fuck what ya heard
And up the mini 14 and mouths burn, last word
I thank they stem, and couldn't finish
When I said above the law my nigga I meant it
Above the law

(chorus)</repeat></pre>
