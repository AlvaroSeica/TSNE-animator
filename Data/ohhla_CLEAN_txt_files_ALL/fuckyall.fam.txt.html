[Intro: Lounge Lo (Crunch Lo)]
What? (Fuck you!) Fuck you!

[Chorus: Crunch Lo]
Fuck y'all niggas that be talkin' shit
You know about them three niggas that I run wit
So fuck y'all niggas that be talkin' shit
I don't give a fuck about ya gun or ya click
Aiyo fuck y'all niggas tht be talkin' shit
We could take it to the block, we could handle it
So just fuck y'all niggas that be talkin' shit
And just fuck y'all niggas that be talkin' shit

[Lounge Lo (Molly-Q)]
I heard a car crash, nigga jumped out and started runnin'
Speakerphone talk on the cell, ya man's comin'
Staten Island kid, Verazanno Bridge, for real
These niggas know the deal, all them cats in the Hill
How we Wild Beneen but still slash Tom Guns slash Pill-
A-G-E, K.G.B. is how I go crazy with teams
Analyze look at the kid, see he's soft, take his CREAM
But that's the ghetto, young seeds observin'
A lot of fool B1's on the block that's drug servin'
Cracks and dope, weed and soap, they gotta get 'em
For the best of them night time thugs, don't even mess with them
Customers are comin' for credit, or eleven for ten
And better yet we gon' do it again, Sue and his friend
My nigga Dutch hold it down
I stay posted by the Ooh like Radar Ruckus and the tre' pound
Buildin' robbers, black down and hoodie twisted
O.Q., plenty of slugs to feed my biscuit
Twenty-one machine gun funk is illified monkey junk
is what I teach right here, BBC is what I speak right here
Is what I speak right here

[Interlude: Crunch Lo]
On some B.B. Conduct, B.B. Conduct, what?
Rock a Beneen, shock a Beneen

[Molly-Q]
Fuck non-believers, car divas, drug divas
Bags of eight, Chi Wan, the pussy of Machiba
Databank, spit spikes, smoke dynamite
Ignite like gasoline, my team be all Beneen
Diary unexplained like the City of Atlas
Wrap you in the mattress, start screamin' "Wally Mathis"
Metal jacket, ratchet, several advocates
Average rap catters get splattered, ink damages
Slick encompass mic grip
Hitless inside my fist, pitch marvelous
Pedigrees, change mic degrees on enemies
By all means necessary, Beneen blow the ferry
out the water, verbal slaughter, charmbreak the border
off the fuckin' globe, never struck I spit for gold
Chain snatchin' niggas, fuck you! (fuck you!)

[Chorus]

[Crunch Lo]
Lavish fashion, silk shirts, hidin' the gat in
Live from the Staten, we gon' make it happen
For sake, I want the whole cake for the crew
Abide by the rules, connect all these jewels
Like Bell Atlantic phones up and down the board
I love hustlin' broads, straggle cats with mic cords
Adored for my artistry, pardon me God
Lickin' out my right arm, y'all just remain calm
'Til the phat bone is lit, that's when it's all over
Enter in my realm and it all got colder
No hearts, bullets with names and no aim
Touchin' up whatever, tryin' to earn ya fame
The same old same, documentated, illustrated by an MC
Potent rhymes dumpin' off until I'm empty
Simply explained, tearin' out ya frame
Like a kaleid', multiply, win by a landslide

[Polite]
Yo yo yo yo
Fuck y'all niggas are cowards, you roll wit
Cuz you cold bitch swallowin' clips like cold dicks
You broke mothafuckas now thinkin' you rich
Should I hit 'em with the fifth or just feed 'em to the pits?
Bless y'all, Othorized F.A.M. 'bout to wet y'all
Run up on y'all niggas in the mess hall to test y'all
Pull a pick out then undress y'all
Murderin' snakes, Up North style, battle for grapes
Let my dogs out the box when we rattle the gates
Got you fake gorilla niggas now actin' like apes

[Chorus]

[Hook: Crunch Lo]
And just fuck y'all niggas that be talkin' shit
And just fuck y'all niggas that be talkin' shit
And just fuck y'all niggas that be talkin' shit

[Outro: Crunch Lo]
Like a bitch, mothafucka
Rock a Beneen, shock a Beneen
NahImean? Mothafucka
B-E, B-E to be Beneen
That's the same tact'
Learn how to do it, nigga
Get defined, mothafucka
So fuck y'all niggas that be talkin' shit
Rock a Beneen, shock a Beneen </pre>
