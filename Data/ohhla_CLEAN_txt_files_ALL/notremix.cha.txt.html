(Intro)
Yeah...
G MIX!
Uhh... looks like a double win for me
It's a Ultimate VIctory
Chamilitary Man

Everybody get low it's a stick up everybody get low everybody get low (x4)

[Chorus]
Everywhere I go-o-o
Everywhere I go they look at me like a criminal
But I'm a C-E-O-O-O
I'm a C-E-O
I'm a self emplyed C-E-O

I'm not a criminal

[Verse 1 - Chamillionaire]
Police tellin me to turn my music down yeah
I used to talk fly to 'em now I flyin yeah
Chamillitary we bout to knock this one outta here
Goin, goin, goin gone
Some rappers just be actin like divas
I'm a young southern money makin over-achiever
Make another cash deposit give the teller a seizure
So many cars I forgot I g-got chamnesia
Big paper yea I'm hearin them talkin
But I ain't believen that cause I hearin dis often
*Disconnected* do-do-do
this number ya callin
has been disconnected cause its the game ballin
I say whats on my mind, they act like its a crime
so get my lawyer on the line I'll be doin some time
they tryna bring me down tell em they can keep tryin
I need that Oprah Winfrey money you know I'm gon get mine
on the grind I getttin my green like a vegetari-on
when we done send em to the cemetery
keep thinkin I'ma lose I ain't ever worried
I'll probably fall off on the 15th February

[Chorus x2]
Everywhere I go-o-o
Everywhere I go they look at me like a criminal
But I'm a C-E-O-O-O
I'm a C-E-O
I'm a self employed C-E-O

I'm not a criminal

[Verse 2 - Snoop Dogg]
I been a lot of places, seen a lot of faces
called in a lot of cases, and beat most of em
I came in the back door and left through da front
Shinin, glistenin, n smokin a blunt
beef, hmm, speakin of ma endin
walk by the dance floor winkin at the women
gang. bangin saggin my pants
babygirl on my nuts why u grabbin my hand?
you almost grabbed the magnum P-I
sorry baby-boo I'm on my mission bout the B-I
neh - I cant mess wit that
besides I got a muthafuckin jet to catch
I'm tryna be the first rap billionaire
As I, pull off an ounce with my nephew chamillionaire
It's so easy to see. It's like Mcgrady, Kobe, Pay me you owe me
Top dollar with the gold flea collar
dippin in my new impala
up and down the block
non-stop I'm a hard pill to swallow tough act to follow
its the dogg-father nigga holla

[Chorus x2]
Everywhere I go-o-o
Everywhere I go they look at me like a criminal
But I'm a C-E-O-O-O
I'm a C-E-O
I'm a self emplyed C-E-O

I'm not a criminal

[Verse 3 - Busta Rhymes]
BUSTA BUS! for short: B-U-S
you ain't know the number: B-O-S-S
C-E-O Dress me properly mister
Portfolio be havin multiple property pictures
62 metre long maybachs with a chauffeur
my negotiating shares and investin in coca cola
my power movin money playin celebrity poker
or an allen degeneres that just love to listen to soaker
key difference with all my money I buy horses
invest in a couple resorts and a couple golf courses
before you go and diss me I think you need to be cautious
Cause I gotta lot of money and got a lot of resources
chamillionaire, let us put together some k quick
on some richard branson he'll probably cop us a spaceship
got a new A-K-A *ching ching* Pardon!
I'm the new meaning of Profit Margin

[Chorus x2]
Everywhere I go-o-o
Everywhere I go they look at me like a criminal
But I'm a C-E-O-O-O
I'm a C-E-O
I'm a self emplyed C-E-O

I'm not a criminal

Everybody get low it's a stick up everybody get low everybody get low (x2)

I'm not a criminal</pre>
