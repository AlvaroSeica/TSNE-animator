HO!! To the floor (Neptunes)
Everybody to the floor!

WOO!! To the floor (MC)
Everybody to the floor
(Nelly) C'mon!!

[Verse - Mariah Carey] (Nelly)
Baby! I don't wanna let you think I'm..
(I'd like to try ya, I think ya so on fire)
Easy! (WOO!) Like them other girls that you may see
(I can't deny it, I keep trying to fight it)

[Pre-Chorus - Mariah Carey] (Nelly)
I just wanna make sure that
You really want me just for me
Cause it's not just that I'm so impressed
By all your cars and your jewelry
And you know, like I know feel that chemistry
(You know I feel it just the same as you)
(So won't ya bring that down to me, aye!)

Whatever happens! (Whatever happens!)

I'm free and I just wanna make sure that
You really want me just for me
Because it's not just that I'm so impressed

And you know, like I know feel that chemistry
