Song:   Get Righteous or Die Tryin'
Typed by: DaSun Akbar

(Chorus) x2
I gotta get righteous or die tryin'
Born to be a king not a dope-dealer supplyin'
Locked in a bottom of a jail cell cryin'
Gangsters don't shed tears, the OG's lyin'

[Chief Kamachi]
I tote to the karma king tryna get the game score
It ain't red or blue the color green start the gang war
I did some things in life that I should be ashamed for
Eight hours shifts in the snow by the same store
Dope-fiends bopping their heads with a vein tour
Walk with the steel umbrella if the rain pour
Welcome to the world young fella', we getting slained more
Can't think straight they putting poison in our brain core
My sneaker money taking food our children stomach
Three weeks in the street, watch the good feelings plummet
Wasted so many days starring at the ceiling blunted
Can't get a legal job, but nigga I don't really wanted it
I ain't shit, eating off the devil fork
Satanic degree, I ain't even a level short
It ain't no sovereignty we strolling in a rebel court
They talking some time, a young mind never thought
God of the Universe, why'd you send me to this Earth?
Show me my afterlife before you send me to the hearse
I just wanted to put some pennies in my mommies purse
College degree, I just might get hammy first
Crazy, without the options that you gave me
I feel that I was born to be a hustler since a baby
Entrepreneur, settled in the wrong hood
24/7 peddling the wrong goods
Just my path, dealing with the nonsense
Don't wanna be a murderer with killings on my conscious
Looking in the wine glass looking for my sanity
Wars on, lay under a camouflage canopy
It's serious, doped and quarantine our areas
Niggas hungry better feed the pit bulls tear us
Bite marks in the moon, nighttime scare ya
Guns go boom like they came straight from Syria
The government crooked, the people is crooked
I'm just tryna get it back but they the first one took it
That's my mindset; streets ain't got a pension for a crime vet
Each day is our last, they don't know how much time left
I hear a voice, "Brother take a divine steps
Search deep within, that's where divines kept
Pick up a book and study our history"
Fam, king kidnapped got brought to a mystery ledge
We came on a boat with a chain and a rope
All we had was our God and our Kingdom of hope
It's our mathematics that operate the cables ?????
40 acres nigga they gave us 40 ounces of dope
Ready to snap like they programmed man to attack
It took us centuries to get our fuckin' families back
Ain't got a million from sports, ain't got a million from rap
They working minimum wage tryna get 'em a nap
It's been a minute since the fridge had some groceries packed
All I can do is try to get where I'm supposed to be at
See the light in the force code, days till the war drum
All this bullshit, music making us more dumb
The stress, drugs, and sex is weakening our health
I ain't preaching at niggas, I'm just speaking for myself
Child of Africa raised in America
Traveling back home tryna purify my character

(Chorus) x2
I gotta get righteous or die tryin'
Born to be a king not a dope-dealer supplyin'
Locked in a bottom of a jail cell cryin'
Gangsters don't shed tears, the OG's lyin'
