[Chorus]
I said, where do you see yourself in a couple of years
I said, where do you see yourself in a couple of years
I said, where do you see yourself
Where do you see yourself
Where do you see yourself
I said, where do you see yourself in a couple of years

[Verse 1]
I get so high my lungs hurt
I drink too much, got liver problems
And I put it on my bottom, got silver dollar
Black on black guns, got nigga problems
Lights, Action Bronson, strike back and conquer
And Parks and Recreations like Ronald Swanson
Nigga with an attitude, straight outta Compton
And I ain't from Gotham, I'm from Patterson
And I'm smokin weed, and pacing y'all
And my head it aches cause I'm overcharged
Then you on my nerves
You know what happened to the ball, it curved
And I chucked my deuce like a swerve
Since you got a mouth, then holla
If you ain't gonna follow me then swallow
I ain't trickin on what's drippin
I'm sittin on my next dollar

[Chorus]
Now ask that to a blind person

[Verse 2]
People try and get in touch with a nigga but
But don't have... in my Disney cup
I'm pourin henny up, drinking more Remy up
Pass out, dreaming about pullin this Bentley up
Really, I'm silly but, giddy up, stupid ass
No mind, top down, when my... ass
And I pass A+ in my music class
Do the math, loser pass
We the future of hip hop, punk rock
Take a selfie with your groupie ass
Pose for the picture
Pose for the picture
Photo with a nigga
Take your photo with a nigga
Take a photo with a nigga

[Outro]
They say you never reach what you search
On your duration's visit
We die to make a living
And do things like pay attention
On your road your daily mission
Skys the limit, limbs extended
Care to see the land and the water
Where nature created friendship
From a picture to the beach chair
I'm at the beach, I'm coolin, I'm coolin
I'm at the beach, I'm coolin, I'm coolin</pre>
