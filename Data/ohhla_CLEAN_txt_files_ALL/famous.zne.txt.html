[Lil' Zane]
What will it take for you to notice me; it's like I'm not here
Do you see us can you see us down here
We have a bad habit of lookin over people
But this time I'm gon' die famous and everybody gon' know

[Verse 1]
I'm just a skinny nigga tryin to get bigger and grow stronger
and the lust to live plush and can't wait no longer
sick of seein moms workin comin home back hurtin
Cryin on my shoulder cuz the job's workin her over
On time everyday but the boss won't promote her
He's racist she say and assaultin in some way
Gon' see him on his off day, gon' let him know
You fucks wit moms no mo' when I drive the 44
When the headlines read, "Boy's Last Heart Was His Mind For Greed"
And he'll probably get the chair if good reason ain't there
tell the judge my excuses for the crimes I've committed 
I was high when I did it
Worked a pound of Jay's herb, in the heat of the night
my mind clicked up on some other shit, something ain't right
met in the parking lot
he was comin out his parking spot
Bet nobody see it out there, it stay dark a lot
Went for the handle but the door was locked
At the same time cockin the glock kickin the car door
maybe not hold up, wait a minute
this rap game just got in it
and plus game I'm sayin two times
the world'll be mine

[Chorus: Lil' Zane]
Gonna be famous, hard to be nameless
Niggas gotta die to be famous
If I die famous, hard to explain this 
I live a life to die famous

[Verse 2]
hustle money by Bloods, Crips, and drug dealers
It's all love wit us but disrespect, you catch slugs nigga
I hang wit cutthroat niggas that'll choke yo niggas
Tie you up and rope yo niggas for rap or for dope baby
when I was young couldn't picture bein broke baby
then fuckin wit them dope boys
had me low crazy
you know it's crucial when I'm sellin to my folk figure
dope fiends mixed genes
Papa was a rolling stone and I ain't grown
Left this lil nigga all alone, now a nigga grown
Genetic game that you passed on
Guess how many niggas I've passed gone, niggas in the system now
Ho's wantin me to hit it, but I'm dissin now
They got me wild, I know it's foul
but respect my lifestyle, it isn't fair
Before I'm legal I'll be a millionaire

chorus 2X's

[Verse 3]
Woke up this morning and saw the news flash, special report
the judge gave a nigga life cuz the boy shot up the court
witness we die for niggas
pullin triggas for a livin 
and we takin any and everything that we wasnt given
cuz hard times, keep a nigga keep writin hard rhymes
stash 9's run up in a nigga ain't scared to squeeze mines
freeze time, when I stop your heart
cuz the slugs that i'm spittin is the spot that could stop
I die famous, you be the nigga I shot
but still nameless, cuz they cant figure the plot
my crew stainless, and we aint hailin no pot 
and ain't nobody gettin bigger than the niggas we got
we worldwide, but we ride for a nation of thugs
we burnin heaters if you cheat us
dudes workin the slugs
And get the sex baby cuz I'm addicted to fame
You make me bust just by screamin my name
and when I die I die famous

[Chorus]

(Yes!)

[Chorus]

(Why do we have to die)

[Chorus]

(I know a lot of times.. we go unnoticed)
(They act like they don't love us)
(But I love you that's all that counts)

[Chorus]

(We love you thats all that counts)
(It's hard to explain why we die famous)
(But we do it baby)
(C'mon)

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

(Boy we gotta get noticed)
(We go to school but you don't see that)
(We live but you don't see that)
(This is how we know)
(This is you'll see)

Young world baby
We tired of goin unnamed 
We tired of goin unnoticed
We've lived in the ghetto for years now
We movin to the hills nigga
C'mon
Bringin wood to the hood
Y'all know what it is
Young world
I put my life on the line for y'all
I love y'all
It dont matter how hard it get
Know matter how hard you try, you keep tryin nigga
Nigga the world is yours</pre>
