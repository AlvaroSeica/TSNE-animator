[Intro] Hello Walls [x5]

[Krizz Kaliko]
Is anybody listening?
It's like I'm yellin but I'm whisperin
It's like it doesn't even matter
Talkin fast, but it's idle chatter
If you can feel me hear me out
I've got something to talk about
I promise I won't waste your time
Never mind I'm like...

[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]
Hello walls, hello ceiling
No one's home and I'm feelin
All alone lone lone lone lone lone
Hello bed, hello pillow
When I'm high I still feel low
No one knows me like my things but no one answers when I scream
HELLO WALLS

And I keep feelin invisible

[Tech N9ne]
Layin in this bed I fear
Me fillin my brain with some leads right near
I think if I do this my head I clear
Or maybe I should overdose on these meds right here
Every time I get ahead a wall hits me fall quickly
yall history when it came to my art history it was iffy
The laws just be raw this we call shifty
Tall chips to fix me balls stall that be all thrifty
I don't let nobody see my pain
Behind these walls bet this blade'll help me see my veins cause these walls are cavin in and this ceiling's gettin closer to me
Everybody is unhappy with me and takin away all my does a doosy
I feel so helpless and nervous that I will go ill so freakin real though and spill slow
Caribou coffee tryin to stop my boulou nill so my grill show daily
But now I leave tears upon my pillow
Right now I'm real low so

[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]
Hello walls, hello ceiling
No one's home and I'm feelin
All alone lone lone lone lone lone can you hear me
Hello bed, hello pillow
When I'm high I still feel low
No one knows me like my things but no one answers when I scream
HELLO WALLS

[Krizz Kaliko]
My life is looks like a party that never ends
I can't tell whats business and whats friends
I think they pretend to like me and then I'm slightly gettin thrown off my look
Now why they phone off the hook huh
Tryin harder to make it through the weekend
I try to push it farther to act like I ain't speakin
I walk through the door
There's no one else to walk to
I talk to the wall there's no one else to talk to

And I keep feelin Invisible

[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]
Hello walls, hello ceiling
No one's home and I'm feelin
All alone lone lone lone lone lone can you hear me
Hello bed, hello pillow
When I'm high I still feel low
No one knows me like my things but no one answers when I scream
HELLO WALLS
