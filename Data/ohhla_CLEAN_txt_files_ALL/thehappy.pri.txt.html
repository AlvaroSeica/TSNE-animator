Can you feel it, can you taste it
Can you see it, can you touch it
Could you love it, don't you covet
Can you drug it, or can you fuck it
Oh the happy, it's the happy
We're the happy, oh so happy
It's the happy, I'm so happy
The happy, has come here

I'm on fire, I'm on fire
I'm on fire

Don't you wonder, oh I wonder
What a wonder, wonder, wonder
If you know
Then let's go
Get real high
But not if you go low
I just found it
I wanna let you know
It's the place where
I'm gonna take you, go

It's the happy, oh the happy
We're the happy, oh so happy
It's the happy, get the happy
I'm so happy, someone smack me

Alright, here it comes
Alright

It's alright, it's ok
Here we are, another day
And if you are wondering why
You are here, well so am I
I got all the answers
That's why I've got dancers
If you want to follow me
Be good, be good to what you see

Let's get happy, I'm on fire
Let's get happy, I'm on fire
Let's get happy, I'm on fire
Let's get happy

Alright, here it comes
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
Let's get together, get it together
Everybody work, work it out, come on, come on
Let's get together, get your shit together
Everybody work, work it, work it, work it

Let's get happy, ohh
I'm so happy, ohh
Alright, ooh ooh
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
Let's get happy, ohh
I'm so happy, ohh
Alright, ooh ooh</pre>
