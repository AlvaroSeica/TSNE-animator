Song:   Sexapade
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
come jump in my escalade
I'm so drunk I forgot my name
all I wanna do is get laid
come join me in my sexapade
[repeat]

[Romes 1st verse]
Baby you beautiful you dress so provocative but why the hell you gotta be so damn talkative
Yo stories too long yo skirt is short
Yo homegirls makin me dizzy smoking dem new ports
Now I been drinkin me and marques at the bar
And I hope the henny aint makin you look like super star
Cuz I aint tryna wake up flippin and mad wit a broad who resembles Donovan McNad
My homey black told me you was a dime plus
You smelled so good that you cleared his sinus
Lips so full keep my helmet shined up
Girl lets go somewhere nobody can find us
Coo whats yo name again
Jeremy, Jerrod, Jerome
All I kno my last name is Jones
Girl believe me when I through witchu I guarantee you'll forget yo name too oo

[Chorus 2x]

[Romes 2nd verse]
yo bodys vicious, delicious momi blowin me kisses
fly misses and ?? jellyfishes(girl I'm drunk and I see you high)
and I aint tryna drive and catch a DUI uh uh
back seat of my jeep lets swing a episode
hold up let the cd change and load
I'm bout to let you have it to Lenny Cravits girl
lets pretend this escalade seat is a craftmatic
I'm like a jack rabbti I hope you aint asthmatic
baby just drop yo thong like a bad habbit
we gon have dis ally smoking like a cookout
the big homey Vern got us covered he da look out
got my truck rockin like monkeys fightin in it
and after the back shots its time to go back into V.I.P actin as nothing happened holla

[Chorus 2x]

[Smooth verse]
I kno you wanna hit, get up in it and kill it
So you can run back and tell yo homies how we did it
My booty firm and chunky I ride it like a donkey
Skeet skeet stop frontin boy you kno you want me
You wanna turn me out, turn me ova, turn me on, turn me into a freak and get me started like a
mota
You kno I cant stop let me get on top
My booty jiggle like jello on the real watch

[Chorus]</pre>
