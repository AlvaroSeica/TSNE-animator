[Chorus: Onyx]
We Don't Fuckin Care!!!
We Don't Fuckin Care!!!
We Don't Fuckin Care!!!
Who the fuck in here?!!!

[Verse One: Fredro Starr]
Yeah, I guess I'm the guest of honor, I'm guilty
I guess, your honor why niggas wanna test my honor
It's honor amongst thieves I run with petty crooks
Schemin on niggas like yo, that baby shook
But he looked, to the ground, when you look him up and down
Be by my Brooklyn side, you let the crooks inside
And pride could be a man's worst killer
I'd rather starve than be a purse stealer
The worst feel us, 'cause we comin from a dark place
I see the light, niggas runnin up on Park Place
Every night you got the narcs chasin (Narcs chasin)
The feds place every night will have your heart racin
Half my niggas facin time in the system
Never gave a fuck type of niggas don't listen, when you tell 'em
Fall back or you're gonna be a felon but they keep on rebellin

[Chorus: Onyx]
We Don't Fuckin Care!!!
Who the fuck in here?!!!

[Verse Two: A$AP Ferg]
Hello, I'm Fergie Fergie, diamond teeth lookin pearly
Rowdy here with the worst than lord baby have mercy
Boy I could get dirty you rappers never concern me
Talkin 'bout you the best your vision is gettin blurry
Nigga I'm the God from Trinidad spittin curry
Eatin you rappin niggas and spit the shit from the turd
'Cause you nigga is through I'll put you niggas in suits
Poppin your tops off like you niggas is coupes
Your bitch 'gon blow my team up my crew niggas is zeus
Willie Lynch with the flow I'll put you niggas in nooses
Get thrown off the roof like you Bishop in Juice
Forty below Tims I'm sportin my Bishop boots
What comes out of that is known as the deuce deuce
I (Pew Pew) you pew when I'm sprayin the perfumre
Devil is wearing Pada I'll put him in dirrt room
Devil you gonna holla you leavin this earth soon
It's like, right about now 'cause it's passin your curfew

[Chorus: Onyx]
We Don't Fuckin Care!!!
Who the fuck in here?!!!

[Verse Three: Sticky Fingaz]
Why should I fuckin care?! I never had shit!
Moms gave birth to me on a pissy mattress
Pops disappeared nigga taught me mad shit
My idea of fun growin up is doin bad shit
The first licks that I hit was fo' laughs
No friends, I come around and niggas haul ass
As far as I can 'member I been on the warpath
I would, rob Peter and take all Paul cash
So I'm, glad I was born with this eye like that
With all them shiesty niggas gotta see behind my back
My face the last thing you see besides my strap
Birth take nine months but with a nine mill' you die like that!
So I'm lookin out for number one the world made me selfish
Prayin is fuckin dumb we all goin to hell bitch!
But I'm a mortal live forever like a shellfish
Only the strong survive preyin off the helpless

[Chorus: Onyx]
We Don't Fuckin Care!!!
Who the fuck in here?!!!

[Verse Four: Sean Price]
P! Bars will diminish your show tunes
Best by far with Onyx and the Snowgoons
Been tragic, my raps, been magic
I pitch rocks with one arm, I'm Jim Abbott
You been slackin what happened? I've been rappin
Gem snatchin and laughin at your mens fashion
P! The best is go guess
My full crep on niggas you dress like Mos Def
Uh! Fuck all that dumb shit
I'll rip your arms off and use them shits for drumsticks
Your mama in jail your father is frail
Your sister a call girl duke 'gon bomb her and sell
Uh! Sean don't know better
A whole 'lot of cheddar Raekwon no low sweater
The end of the verse, send me your purse you bitch!

[Chorus: Onyx]
We Don't Fuckin Care!!!
We Don't Fuckin Care!!!
We Don't Fuckin Care!!!
Who the fuck in here?!!!</pre>
