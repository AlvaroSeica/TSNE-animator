We're sinners and we're seperated from God

[Intro - Hell Razah]
Take your time young man
Yeah, yeah, for all my shorties
KnowhatI'msayin? Livin' that ghetto life
Israel, Fortune 5000, hustlin', straight up
Big Hass Da Phantom, knowhatI'msayin? Razah Enterprise
Hell Razah, all my GG, Maccabees
KnowhatI'msayin? Throw it up
This is for my brothers, that I lost before I got to the game
KnowhatI'msayin? Don't be listenin'
Big Char', Big Glenn, Father Lord
You hear me, see ya destiny, for real
After me, buggin' son, niggas is speakin on
Niggas ain't listenin'

+True Kingz+ never die (no, no, no, no)
+True Kingz+ will survive (oh, oh, oh, oh)
+True Kingz+ never die (no, no, no, no)
+True Kingz+ will survive (oh, oh, oh, oh)

[Hell Razah]
When I was young, man, never thought it'll come to an end
In the projects, I lived there, Red Hook, Brooklyn
Before Kingz got shot at for beige sheepskins
Reminiscin' on the nights we didn't listen to Glenn
Wore the suits, smoke the weed, drinkin' the fifth of gin
We had the same Timberlands before the winter came in
Now I forgive to make a chain before my seed get ten
In the room of the beast we like a season sin
Through the children is the only way we breath again
We never know the shit, but still drug game is over wit
You either die or go to jail, for no funds, controllin' it
We never shift it, but always get caught by holdin' it
By the government, finance those who floatin' it
So whose the culprit, the one ownin' it or who be smokin' it
So those who lost souls in the game, to my condolences
Flash backs all the past blacks die for crack
And make grandma's fade out and have heart attacks
Fuck these democrats, 'welcome in' mats, we send 'em back
Til we take back the almanac, plan a format
Never saw a rap, or a adap., adap.

[Ermaine]
+True Kingz+ never die (no, no, no, no)
+True Kingz+ will survive (oh, oh, oh, oh)

[???]
True queens never die (no, no, no, no)
True queens will survive (oh, oh, oh, oh)
When I'm hustlin' in the streets
The game of life is +Playin IV Keeps+
The game is real ain't nothin' sweet
The earth will be inherited by the meak

[Ermaine] (???):
And life is so damn unpredictable
You never know when you're gonna go
So tell me why (tell me why)
Tell me why (tell me why, yeah)

[7th Ambassador]
For the love of paper, a young brother
A sell drugs to his own mother
Knowin' that she was stone lover
The only coke that kept her bones covered
She so, she can smoke another
Shiverin' as she lit it, fiendin' to hit it
Preoccupied wit gettin' high
Her mind didn't realize she was in frigid
Cold blooded world full of snakes and lizards
After the high, she died within a matter of minutes
And gone wit the wind was the spirit
The only witness to describe her was commited
Was it somebody continue to handle the business
A fast black youth who had a bad attitude about mad jewels
Only 16, schemin' the Beem down the avenue
Was atleast concerned about the bad news
Said he had too, receive the capital
Even though it was taboo, he couldn't come short on the cashews
Stuck between a rock and a heartless
Where cash rule, he explain it like it was natural
But so what, he sold drugs wit his old thugs
Who got coked up, who said show him mo' love
Then those who were supposed, my cosa nostra
He yelled those peaches and gold dove
Cock the Beemer neutral, like it was somethin' he was used to
Had his Beemer blastin' louder than a Broadway musical
But didn't notice anythin' unusual
His man laid back diggin' his peudicals
What other peoples gonna do, the girls playin' hoola hoop
By the time he put two and two together
One pull a Beretta, from under the sweater
You know the whole shit was a set-up
One shot rock to lift his head up

[Ermaine]
He hit 'em, he hit 'em
+True Kingz+ never die
True queens will survive

[???]
Oh, oh
True queens never die (never die)
True queens will survive (survive)
When I'm hustlin' in the streets
The game of life is +Playin IV Keeps+
The game is real ain't nothin' sweet
The earth will be inherited by the meak

[Ermaine] (???):
And life is so damn unpredictable
You never know when you're gonna go
So tell me why (tell me why)
Tell me why (tell me)
Ooh, oh, Lord
The +True Kingz+ never die
No, no, no, no, no, no, no (never die)
Ooh, Lord
The +True Kingz+, will really survive
We survive, we survive, we survive (will survive)
Ooh, Lord
The true queens will never die
Never die, never die, never die (never die)
Ooh, Lord
The true queens will survive
Will survive, will survive, will survive (will survive)
Ooh, Lord
The +True Kingz+ will always survive
We survive, we survive, we survive
Oh, oh, oh, we survive, we survive, we survive...</pre>
