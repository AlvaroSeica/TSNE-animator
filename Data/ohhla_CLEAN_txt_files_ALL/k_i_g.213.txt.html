Keepin' it gangsta
Niggaz and niggettes
Keepin' it gangsta
Niggaz and niggettes

[Warren G]
I was raised in the church but spent more days raised in the turf
And crime pays so I spent my days on the search
Parade with a smirk, fresh fade with a church
Nextel wave alert, renegades about the dirt
Hurt the fresh white t-shirt, that's when we skirt
These jerks ain't trying to flirt with the fellas
Besides, these rappers ain't doing no telling
Bailing with an attitude and that ain't nothing
and ain't no telling if dude gonna blast you
But got it confused, I break rules, take nothing from fools
I make it so that there's something gon' move
I move slow, bowguard the 'do low
Hit the Sillabard in a blue '64
Sitting kind of low in everywhere we go
We keeping it gangsta and that's for sho'
Come on!

[Nate Dogg]
It's that gangsta music that they adore
All the gangstas take the floor
When we step on stage, all the ladies scream for more

It's that gangsta music that they adore
All the gangstas take the floor
When we step on stage, all the ladies scream for more

[Nate Dogg]
My sister's cousin's told me
Her sister heard some stories
We were so gangsta growing up
We got the girls excited
Sluts up front just give their bodies
Take them straight to the after party
Two homeboys in the closet hiding
Ain't no fun if they can't ride it
I can't be faded
I'm a nigga from the motherfucking streets
Trump tight and you can't deny it
Fuck up everyone who's tried it
I remember when it started
Seems like yesterday morning
Blame it on us, yeah we did it
Took 'em probably got gangsta with it

[Chorus]

[Snoop Dogg]
Real flow, this is steel-toed biscuits
213 yeah we on that pimp shit
Mix in with some Crip shit, that's how it's scripted it
Bag it up, sack it up, give it to your dips
and bring me half back
I'm trying to get some spinners for that brand new Cadillac
Ride with me, roll with me, slipping down the runway doing about 450
I'm living the jet, clearing the deck, steering a 'Vette
You bitch niggaz ain't hearing me yet
So I pull out my hollow with heaters
Pop 'em and bleed 'em you niggaz better follow the leader
Skippity we boop we rock scooby doo
What would life be nigga without Big Snoop?
Don't trip cuz I'ma always G for y'all
Hate on the law and LBC on ya dog

[Chorus]

[Snoop Dogg]
Yeah
It's 213, 213
Yeah it's 213
Yeah it's 213
Yeah we all so G for real
This  213
EAst side and LBC
This 213 you know and we all so G

[Chorus]</pre>
