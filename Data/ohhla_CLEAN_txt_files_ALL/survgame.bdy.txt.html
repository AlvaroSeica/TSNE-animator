[Intro: Ice-T]
YEAH!! ~ YEAH!!
MURDER!! ~ DIE!!

[Ice-T]
As I search to analyze reality
The true meaning of life
Our simple existence means nothing
God has a gun, the truth; life is a slow noose
He's invincible, better watch his knife
There is no escape from the slow kill
When it's time to go, God serves the death blow
You have no choice, don't even try
The only choice is SUICIDE!!

[Chorus: Ice-T]
Surviving the game, surviving the game!
Surviving the game, surviving the game!
Surviving the game, surviving the game!
SURVIVING THE GAAAMMMEE!!!

[Break: Ice-T]
No escape, no escape, no escape
No one's ever escaped!
No escape, no escape, no escape
DIE!!

[Ice-T]
As I search to analyze reality
The true meaning of life
Our simple existence means nothing
God has a gun, the truth; life is a slow noose
He's unmerciful, better watch his knife
There is no escape from the slow kill
When it's time to go, God serves the death blow
You have no choice, don't even try
The only choice is SUICIDE!!

[Chorus: Ice-T]
Surviving the game, surviving the game!
Surviving the game, surviving the game!
Surviving the game, SURVIVING THE GAAAMMMEE!!!
Surviving the game!

[Outro: Ice-T]
You came right from death</pre>
