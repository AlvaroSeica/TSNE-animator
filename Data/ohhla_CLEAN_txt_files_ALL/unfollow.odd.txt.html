Typed by: @Oddisee

I wonder why I follow you
we ain't really friends just pretend
If these walls came down bet our
pants would follow suit
know you got a man but then again I only know because a message that
you wrote that I responded to
I'm digging you &amp; it's more than just physical 
can't describe it in written form
all I feel is I'm fond of you
&amp; if I had a chance I would take it
I know you're feelings
are adjacent so quit your faking you're on it too
lets rendezvous
meet you down in the city lets
grab some coffee you with it
than it's a date &amp; we on a two
damn it, I didn't plan it, you naked
this vantage point is the greatest
I'ma embrace lets form a group
living within the moment, dismissing patience
tensions building brake it, no delaying, we over due
I'm holding you, dear to me, near to me
is where you should be
I want you, you want it too
lets just do what we're gonna do
We've been dating now for a while
is this serious or we're pals
with agreements to come
around when the sun is down
another moon in my room guess it's safe to assume you're out
when the sun is back, you'll be back for another round
I work from home, I'm around 
I ain't doing shit except for you &amp; some music
girl you my muse, you another sound
like of it, love it
we ain't rushing the discussion on what we are is due, but we shut it down
we're only human, what we're doing
got an ending for now we're pretending that it don't so lets fuck around
let's hit the fan till we can't stand each other
one of us fall in love but the other don't want it now
we do it, in the moment fully knowing this ain't cool
but we're fools for each other so we something now
good while it lasted, we turned my bed to a casket
no longer under covers now we're underground</pre>
