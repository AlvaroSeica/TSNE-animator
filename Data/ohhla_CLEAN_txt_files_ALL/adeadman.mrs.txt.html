(Mr. Serv-On)
It's a quarter to ten
He was my friend
Hit the funeral, roses in my hand
Payin respects to a dead man
Hugged his mama, kissed his girl
Got his dope and his son, your fuckin life is now my fuckin world
Don't even hear the preacher talkin
Just thinkin about the money 
and the bedroom noise me and his wife been makin
He told me how she like to take it- so I'ma give it
I see you later, fuck your clothes bring my pussy and my son
And this gangsta shit is done
I shoulda spit in your face after the way she fucked me in the game
I hope you burn in vain
One day your son will call me daddy
It's your fault 'cuz you lost loyalty
We been fuckin around since diapers
But you let another nigga touch you
Now that bitch work for me
But not for long- I ordered that bitch here at a quarter to three
And if he got a bitch- I'ma pimp her
For every minute you had to suffer
And fuck her for every dollar you had to cover
That's how it goes, nigga you know the game
You shoulda stayed real
That's why I'm saying "Fuck a dead man!"
You know the deal, your cap's got peeled

Should I bang him?
Should I kill him, should I take him from his family?
(Fuck em, fuck em!)
