Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Uhh this is about real as its gone get
Gotta feed the streets they say they need some mo shit
Gangbanging Bibby yeah I'm back on my old shit
Million needs nigga just because the flows sick
Its levels to this shit, that 40 dig graves like a shovel on my hip
I get the work on my kinect all on my dick
Haters come around wonder how I make it flip
Shit as simple as this, Bibby got nicks and they look like dimes
Why the fuck you think the feins ain't hitting yo line
Waste no time its show time I'm gone grind
I'm doing fine these niggas hate I don't mind
Riding with the mac, curtains on ghost I'm just hiding in the back
New street sweeper whip yo guys off the map
We the hottest out yall blind to the fact
Real nigga shit I ain't lying in my rap
Bibby spit raw have yo mind full of crack
Niggas gonna hate never mind if of that
You can't be the one behind all of that
10k for my new watch, Riding around with my new Glock
White shawn on speed just press through and get you shot
100 grand for my new spot yall niggas got the strip hot
I'll fuck around and buy a new block
Call bro if you do rocks, I know some killas when they see me they say wassup
Niggas on that tuff stuff
That'll get you fucked up, actually get you touched up
Money call him right now, Shorty you own lucked up
Gotta get my bucks up

[Hook x2:]
You should to if you knew what this game would do to
you look at all the shit that I go through
Look at all the shit that I go through

See I been thinking about giving up niggas been swiching up
They hating they want beef but niggas ain't big enough
That's not what I rhyme for so I ain't got time for
Whenever I hit the stage all you hear is that encore
My money up, look at my chain, look at my car look at my wrist
Look at my squad you see them toys look at our hips
Niggas looking like they want us to spark some shit
Until them see them boys slumped up in the yard and shit
I used to hustle hard for kicks and shit
Youngin' running around hitting licks and shit
Now I sit down with the plug and talk bricks and shit
I'm from the slums man how did I get to this
Now its 10k for a show nigga and I'm straight from the go nigga
Ask around they know nigga, We come through get low nigga
I'm all about this dough nigga I don't fuck around with no broke niggas
I don't think they was listening but I swear to god I told niggas

[Hook x2:]
You should to if you knew what this game would do to
you look at all the shit that I go through
Look at all the shit that I go through</pre>
