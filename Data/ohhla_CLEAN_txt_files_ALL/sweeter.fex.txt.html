[PHONTE]
Listen
So hard to read between the lines
Just know you are mine
I am yours nothing more
Looking for the way to
Ask you to stay here with me
One more night one more day
So I lay here beside you

[CHORUS]
Nothing better to do
What could be sweeter than you
With nothing better to do
I'm asking what could be sweeter than you

[PHONTE]
So much that we can't understand
Take you by the hand
Love so bittersweet
We agreed you should leave
Trying to hold back the feeling 
But we both can see
That its calling me
Been here a thousand times before 
And everytime we swear its a mistake
Shouldnt be this way
This is the game we play to lose
Yet and still I choose
You


[CHORUS]

[PHONTE]
Sweeter than you</pre>
