[Yukon Black]
Pounds, O-Z, Quarter, Nickel, And dime
One time that was all you could find on my mind
Besides verse I've learned they wanted all of my time
Spinned to beats and rhymes couldn't find me dude
Then came the liquor, Just a bottle or two
Long Island nigga, How to draw on them oceans
Wide open off that and the smoke had me loken
I aint gonna say what I did for the sake of the kids
But I could of did a bid and they wouldn't be liven
Cause I was scratchin my itches, Wasn't handlin business
Blame that on my additions, I been countin on this record to fix it
My life on a slip mat, Can you cut it but please don't skip jack
I'm in the strip club given up dubs for rubs
The chicks that I usally wouldn't get no love
Then she sits down, Spits out her name, (Hi, I'm Eisha)
Peace, They call me Yukon Black, Nice to meet ya
What you doin in here, You don't give me stripper vibes Ma
(I got a son huh, Baby this is my night job)
We talked and talked, This how she got my heart
Said she loved hip hop, Even rhymed for the art
Not a word about Tupac, Put Pun up on the juke box
Then got you locked, This is where a dick should hit
I feed dollar after dollar till I spent my rent
Still had a chick to go home to
Now tell me what the fuck was I supposed to do, Man

[Hook: Yukon Black]
Cause I'm scratchin my itches, Trippin off a stripper
Thats' another addiction, Gettin evicted fixed it
My life on a slip mat, Can you cut it but please don't skip jack</pre>
