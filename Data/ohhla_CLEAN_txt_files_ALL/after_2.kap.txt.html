[Intro]
Ay! (Damn)
Ay man (I can't even feel my face)
I'm goin out man, I can't... I can't
You don't know what the fuck you
Nigga you don't know what the fuck you talkin 'bout!
To'n up, torn
(Fucked up man he don't even know what the fuck he talkin)
(Ay man, ay man, you aight man, you aight man)

[Chorus: Madd Kapp]
They won't serve me after 2
They won't serve me after 2
But when they kick me out this bitch
I'm goin home to a fifth or two

[repeat Chorus]

[Madd Kapp]
Damn~! I'd like to tell y'all a few things
I've been to all kinda bars you know
I've been to crazy bars, I've been to hillbilly bars
I've been to techno bars, man fuck it!
I've been to bars downtown
where motherfuckers do everything all under one roof
Hehehe, man though they all kick me out at the same time
It's crazy... but you know, shit happens
And shit stinks so don't start nuttin
My name is M-A-double-D K-A-double-P
And right now I'm representin me
I'm representin everything that I be
And I, I uhh - man~!
I love them horns right there, hold up
Don't that shit remind y'all of somethin?
Don't that remind you of a good time?
Whatever happened to havin a good time by the way?
What the fuck ever happened to havin a good time?
Everybody's always on some uhh
"I'ma shoot you in your face" type shit
But not on this album
Cause if you fuck with me, I will shoot you in your face!

[Chorus]

[Madd Kapp] How the fuck you gonna kick me out my own bar?</pre>
