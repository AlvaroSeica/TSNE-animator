[ VERSE 1: MC Duke ]
Another weekend, life's kinda borin
Looked at my diary, thought about scorin
Called my homeboys to see what's happenin
When's the next show so I can start rappin and
Get on a stage and release my tensions
Say the kind of things that I think should be mentioned
I been the many cities all over the world
Gave five to brothers and made love to girls
And found myself bein chased by women
You need a man, baby, I'll deliver
I'm not a honey-dripper, no drawer on daises
If you take a chance I'm gonna send you to crazy
I'm not braggin as some might figure
But I was born blessed, I'm a straight up blackman
I always speak wisdom, cause those are pearls
And I made this jam for all the girls

For the girls

[ VERSE 2: MC Duke ]
To a hardcore fan - don't think I'm slippin
This ain't a love song and I ain't singin
Just payin respects to the female sex
But if a bitch be ugly I'ma scream out 'Next'
Don't wanna be nasty but that's how it goes
Love good-looking ladies and I hate the hoes
And you can't tell me that all the while
( ? ) when your lady smiles
See my homeboys ( ? ) when we're on tour
Same girls beatin down my hotel door
Hit the fire escape, we don't try to rape
Girls screamin out my name like I'm flyin a cape
Ran down the street almost two blocks
Don't wanna go to prison for a cradle that rocks
I've seen many beauties all over the world
So I made this jam for all the girls

For the girls

[ VERSE 3: MC Duke ]
My girl wanna get me on a stable tip
But I got no time for relationships
Have to go on tour or get interviewed
Or get my photograph taken but I'm into you
No disrespect but I have to go
If I don't leave now I'll be late for the show
So I break right out and slam the door
While my girl freaks out cryin on the floor
That's how I live, no bad intent
Got a record to promote and gotta pay the rent
Me and Leader 1 and we're havin fun
Skeeze wanna get paid? haha she's gonna get some
It don't mean that Dukey gonna do it
I can go get a drink while my boys get to it
I've seen many beauties all over the world
So I made this jam for all the girls

For the girls

[ VERSE 4: MC Duke ]
In the front row, can you hear them screamin
Every single one got a different meaning
Some will say 'Baby, I want you please'
And some be wild like a hoe or a skeeze
It don't matter to Duke, I ain't affected
I check out my women and they're well selected
Gotta be a time, I got the place
Put down your bag and you can drop the mace
No gangbang, baby, cause I got feelings
Just one on one when we be dealin
No interference when I play
Cause everyday is my payday
But remember this, it's career first
For those same words I have been cursed
I always speak wisdom, cause those are pearls
And I made this jam for all the girls

For the girls</pre>
