Song:   She Knows
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Syd Tha Kid]
She's the perfect daughter
Had everything you ever wanted, in you
Planned with false hopes
Major insecurities showed
It wasn't but you say
Made no difference
And I'm hoping that some day
That with this change

[Chorus]
She knows
I really hope that she knows
What she could be
She knows
I really hope that she knows
Turn out to be

[Matt Martians]
She's like the perfect daughter
She's never had anything given
You weren't careful
And now you have a son to hold

[Syd Tha Kid]
It wasn't but you say
Made no difference
And I'm hoping that some day
That with this change

[Chorus]</pre>
