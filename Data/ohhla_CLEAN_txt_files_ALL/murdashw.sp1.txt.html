(MC Eiht)
I don't know homeboy youknowI'msayin?
But I'll tell you like this 
we gonna bust some ass for the ninety-three shot

(Spice-1)
Right, these motherfuckers don't understand
We ain't from around here

(MC Eiht)
That's all right youknowI'msayin?
Cause we ain't takin no shorts youknowI'msayin?
Compton meets the motherfuckin Bay Town nigga
So step the fuck off this youknowI'msayin?
My nigga Spice get with em

(Spice-1)
Ya see I'm nothin but a mac-10 shooter
Killer man looter on the creep with the glock
Got it cocked picidy pop
I cold shot when the cop drop m-a-money gone nigga 
Mind of a lunatic on a steel trigger
motherfuckin flash backs of nigga's bodies rip 
from the AK blast on that ass hollow point to the tip to the toe
Creep slow and watch the blood hit the fuckin flo'
It's the goddamn murda show 
Starring a nigga in black wearin a weed hat creepin low
And co-starring is a psycho motherfucker
He grew up in Compton bustin caps at the cluckers
His name is MC motherfuckin Eiht 
He got the Uzi weigh a ton eatin niggas like a steak on a plate
So nigga get your popcorn and peanuts cause we nuts and we know 
sit back and watch a nigga murda at the murda show

(Chorus: Spice-1 &amp; MC Eiht)
A to the motherfuckin K
187 proof ass nigga from the Bay (murda show)
Yeah, and it's the nigga from Compton that's stompin
Raise up off my jock with the fools that I glock 
A to the motherfuckin K
187 proof ass nigga from the Bay (murda show)
Yeah, and it's the nigga from Compton that's stompin
Raise up off my jock with the fools that I glock

(MC Eiht)
Nigga shut your fuckin trap, yeah your punk ass is sure
Sure that they sew when I peel your cap
The slide the slick, suck my dick
No mistaking I bring home greens, fuck the bacon 
The big black neck getting motherfuckers sprung
They'll be put in the trash by this Compton tongue
Eiht, Spice-1, kickin much ass for fun
Ain't nothin but some nigga sold the one
Fools need to stay the fuck down
They can't hang when we bang from Compton and the Bay Town
It's like the last dance or your last chance
When I reach in for the strap in my fuckin pants
I ?pump? dead then the scene is fair ain't nothin said 
Even your skinny ass dead, I can't sleep cause it's time to go
Fool or I'll be late for the murda show nigga

(Chorus: Spice-1 &amp; MC Eiht)
A to the motherfuckin K
187 proof ass nigga from the Bay (murda show)
Yeah, and it's the nigga from Compton that's stompin
Raise up off my jock with the niggas that I glock 
A to the motherfuckin K
187 proof ass nigga from the Bay (murda show)
Yeah, and it's the nigga from Compton that's stompin
Raise up off my jock with the fools that I glock

(Spice-1)
Step in to the torture chamber nigga let me torture
Hangers on your motherfuckin back bring ya scorcher
Psychopathic madmen dead body chucker 
Quick to pull the trigger on another motherfucker 
Slangin to the bass head bitches in the alley 
Killin for my motherfuckin money in recally
My nigga MC Eiht will make the getaway drive 
I got the gat hangin up out the motherfuckin ride  
Niggas be getting the duck sit fuckin with the player, sprayer layer 
Nigga out with the shout of the t-t-tech, Mic motherfuckin check one 
Stabbin niggas up in the lungs plus the caps with bloody guns 
My Uzi's got my back if player haters wanna jump 
The motherfuckin hollow head his chest thump, thump
And all the niggas leave his bloody body in the dust
One-nigga dead seventeen caps bust 
That's how the niggas do this shit where I'm from 
Red-Rum leave your body numb blast of the dumb, dumb 
I got the glock and I'm headin for the liquor store 
Me and Eiht are two-eleven at the motherfuckin murda show

(Chorus: Spice-1 &amp; MC Eiht)
A to the motherfuckin K
187 proof ass nigga from the Bay (murda show)
Yeah, and it's the nigga from Compton that's stompin
Raise up off my jock or you might get the glock 
A to the motherfuckin K
187 proof ass nigga from the Bay (murda show)
Yeah, and you ask me to stay the fuck down
Bangin from Compton and the Bay Town 

(MC Eiht)
