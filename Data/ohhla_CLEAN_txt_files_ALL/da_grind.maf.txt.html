Nine-eight (2X)

Ahhh
Hit licks, Florida Keys
Old players, old cheese
Smoke blunts, burn leaves
Take fronts, gold trees

Anytime, any grind
Any gun, I don't care
Won't snitch, when in doubt
Top ?, blood's red

Snap quick, trap quicker
Tony Montana, hot Atlanta
Fuck Santa, fuck jail
Fuck a cop, fuck a bail!

You're dead wrong, headstrong
Dick long, got weight
Crime rate, love/hate
They killed Nate, fuck Nate

Sto' Eddie, real steel
Real grill, real shitty
Georgia boys, Georgia girls
Strap up, a real city

See I ain't guilty, the game's filthy
Ask Nino, judge booked a
county time, 7th flo'
For that, shot em both

Trunk one, punk one
Just me, straight hard
Blackheart, lion-heart
Get smart and rip your ass apart

I'm in the, golden tank, no dank
No drank, no bank
Bad times, writtin rhymes
Doin crimes, we on da grind

..

Watch me, raise up
Feet down, triggerman
Spitterman, biggerman
Mama's man, never ran

Hit the fan, hard we
White bwoy, (him) country
Outdone, trigger happy
Hair nappy, my grandpappy

Hit the streets, on track
Tree onions, freeze up!
Re-up, my trap
My grip, hollow tips!

The projects, still kills
Hard times, bad crimes
Got mines, hoes ridin
I'm lyin, fiends buyin

I ain't sleepin, pockets leakin
Hoes freakin, I'm smokin
Grippin oak in, Shaboken
Sun soakin, gun pokin

Break cool, full gat
Bulletman, you all die
Gangstafied, gangsta ties
Crossed the T's, dottin I's

Foldin G's, one point five
Plushed out, hooped out
No doubt, big clout
Wrong route, knocked out

Foe who?  Memories
Street thang, big 'caine
Big game, big pain
Insane, we on da grind nigga

..

(Wicked!!!)

Hit licks, Florida Keys
Old players, old cheese
Smoke blunts, burn leaves
Take fronts, gold trees

Anytime, anywhere
Any gun, I don't care
Won't snitch, when in doubt
Top ?, blood's red

I snap quick, trapped quicker
Tony Montana, hot Atlanta
Fuck Santa, fuck jail
Fuck cops, fuck bail!

You're dead wrong, headstrong
Dick long, got weight
Crime rate, ? rate
Love/hate, they killed Nate

They sto' Eddie, real steel
Real grill, real shitty
Georgia boys, Georgia girls
Strap up, a real city

I'm not guilty, the game's filthy
Ask Wicked, judge booked a
county time, 7th flo'
Fuck that, shot em both

I jump one, punk one
Just me, straight hard
Blackheart, lion-heart
Get smart and rip your ass apart

Golden tank, no drink
No drank, no dank
Bad times, writtin rhymes
Doin times, we on da grind nigga</pre>
