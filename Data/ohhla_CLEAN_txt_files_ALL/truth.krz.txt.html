(*talking*)
What's up world, what is life
Is it really worth it, everything we do
Out here hustling, still won't give us a job
It ain't no excuse, what kinda jobs you give us
Fast food, grown man can't pay his bills

[Krazy]
Mama don't cry, even though this world is hard
They took my people from Africa, and gave us a God
They told us, Jesus was white, and he had blue eyes
Now you devils look concerned, when we find out you lied
Animosity from your race, when you look at me
Screaming what you niggaz want, y'all already free
Are we really free, that's what they want us to think
We be slaves again, just the minute we blink
I can't sank into your bullshit, I follow my heart
And my prophecy's to keep my race, from falling apart
Nothing's as hard as it seems, long as we move with precision
I hope you find it in your heart, just to make your decision
It ain't no secret, these motherfuckers filling the jails
Locking every drug dealer, that they catch in they hell
But we can't see the big picture, cause it's all a plot
Too busy trying to live the same, kinda life that they got

[Hook: Suga Bear]
You must, realize the truth
Only one that's gonna do it for you, is you
And the only one, who can save your life is you
Only one that save your life is you, come on listen to me

[Krazy]
Did you think it was an accident, to keep killing eachother
Fathers leaving us as kids, so we cling to our mothers
Heartless, raised by the streets that guide us
You think heroin is so bad, look at the drugs they shot us
They killed every leader we had, that told the truth
Every time we planted seeds, they pulled them out at the roots
A corrupted ass system, they try to shove down my throat
You know how many people lost they lives, just so we could vote
Half of the homies that I growed up with, is fucking drug addicts
Whether we as a people, feel like it's time to panic
How many niggaz do you know, that's either dead or in jail
Where the fuck do we turn, when the system fails
Only Jesus, cause he can give us the answer
You think these bitches don't have a cure, for aids and cancer
But these motherfuckers always thinking war in they sleep
How you think these military guns, got on the streets

[Hook]

(*talking*)
I know y'all hate me, just like y'all hated Chuck D
Just like y'all hated 2Pac, y'all hated all our leaders
Malcolm X, Martin Luther King, Medgar Evers
And they got a string of lot of other ones
You know what I'm saying, that did what they can do
To make us be free, and I love being free
You know what I'm saying, it's just a bad world a bad world
You could hate me all you want, you know what I don't give a fuck
My mission is to keep my people, from dying out chere
Whether it's drugs going to jail, whether getting killed 
By one another, that's my only mission I give a fuck
What you think, what you think about me
Cause I hate you back, my middle finger stay in the air
It's all love, unity amongst my people
