[Talib Kweli] + (Outasight)
Once upon a time in a land far far away
I tried to play but my heart in the way
This part a little harder to say
It's like the white girl trapped in a well
Help is comin but it's scary as hell
But very well here went the fairy tale
Now Cinderella want a fella who is not so ghetto
So she follow bread crumbs like Hansel &amp; Gretel
Hello - that'll make her drop her underwear
Dough longer than Rapunzel hair
Everyone one stare when she walk in she like (what you want?)
Yo I'm not gonna front, I'll be blunt
I'll make that ass bump, I know that's (what they want)
Me too with my hands up
She turned around like man up, I'm like (here I am)
But I know her from work, she pass by
like he ain't that fly you got (one more chance)
to fall down the rabbit hole
Let me take you Wonderland or I'm makin some other plans

[Chorus 2X: Outasight]
I don't wanna spend the night
Tryin to figure out how to spend my life
I don't wanna spend my time
waiting for you, waiting for you

[Interlude One: Outasight] + (Talib)
(Everybody say) oh, oh, oh oh oh
Oh, oh, oh oh oh
Oh, oh, oh ohhhh
Waiting for you, waiting for you
(Hey, everybody in the house)
(C'mon, you know it well, what I'm talkin about)
(Now say) oh, oh, oh oh oh
Oh, oh, oh oh oh
Oh, oh, oh ohhhh
Waiting for you, waiting for you

[Talib Kweli] + (Outasight)
I made you a star, your light was shinin and so bright
So right that it dwarfed the chicks like Snow White
So nice got down with the team and now you one of us
Got me singing like Prince, "You sexy motherfuh.."
You could be my +Princess Bride+ call you my +Buttercup+
I love when you lettin me be the man
Let me take you by the hand like Wendy in Peter Pan
If you fly by night, that's right, I'll let you make a wish
Eat you up like a favorite dish
Man I pray you not the Wicked Witch (made it through)
A situation where I broke my promise
But now I'm tryin to be honest love (so can you)
Sometimes people evolve
But that involves knowin exactly (what you want)
And right now I want a compromise
By givin your partner (what they want)
My life is an open boo
You had a chapter but will it end happily ever after?

[Chorus]

[Interlude Two: Outasight] + (Talib)
(Here we go yeah, ay, ay)
(Ay that's what I'm talkin about, I put it down like)
(Woo, get your hands up, yeah)
(Everybody in the house say it, say it) oh, oh, oh oh oh
Oh, oh, oh oh oh
Oh, oh, oh ohhhh
Waiting for you, waiting for you
(Yeah, everybody, ah everybody)
(Now everybody say, c'mon) oh, oh, oh oh oh
(Say it with me) oh, oh, oh oh oh
(Say it with me) oh, oh, oh ohhhh
Waiting for you, waiting for you
(Hey, everybody in the house)

[Talib Kweli] + (Outasight)
Life ain't a fairy tale
Now they say sister's bitter and the Brothers is Grimm
Time to let the story end and let another begin
I spun straw into gold like Rumpelstiltskin
Still a whole in my soul that love won't fill in
She Sleeping Beauty cause her eyes was closed
Tried to sleep on your boy like Brian Rose
Now she wild like the coke in your nose
And I'm lyin like Pinocchio
Gotta know when it's time to go
Gotta know when it's (here we are)
We had some good times
Had some Little Red Riding Hood times but (once again)
I'm the Big Bad Wolf
Don't hit me with the sad look love (here I am)
I'm still the same old me
But I don't know if we should give it (one more chance)
To add another chapter
Life ain't always happily ever after
