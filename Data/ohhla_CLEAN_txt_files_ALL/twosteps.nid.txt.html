[Syn] Yeah
[Dug] Yeah
[Syn] Uhh, uhh
[Dug] Yeah that's that shit right there
[Syn] We gon' have fun with this one, hehe
[Dug] That shit right there
[Syn] That's what I'm talkin about, c'mon, ahh, yeah, ahh
      Put your hands to-ge-ther, always be two steps behind, c'mon
      Ha ha!  Yeah, they always be two steps behind

[No I.D.]
I got some niggaz in my way that's tryin to fuck my shit up
Crabs in the bottle of the barrel tryin to get up
You can't hold me down, can't cock block the crown, get the
fuck out my way nigga, we cover ground that's infinite
I press the weight to get gainage
I'm flushin out your wack ass shit like drainage
A thousand mo' beats like this so get looted
I got niggaz under the gun and they shoot it

[Syndicate]
Uhh, uhh, say shoot it
Aiyyo, I make fresh rhymes, daily
You burn me? (You silly girl)
Hahaha, but really I'm nearly the best and the rest are just the average
Who knew that when I uttered a word, it would be tragic
Madness, inadequate ass-kicks
Tactics, my shit's everlasting
Leaving a body casting so you can hold composure
I told ya, I gets more exposure than Motorola
It's over, y'all niggaz on some out of mind shit
So I guess I'm on some out of time shit

[Dug Infinite]
But wait a minute, I gotta get some shit off my chest
Well my soul called in and it had a request
It said, 'Bullshit niggaz think they're, gettin away
But we tallyin your tab, bullshit gotta pay' (it gotta pay)
It's equality, nigga it ain't nuttin nice
Catch you on a cold day and give you nuttin but ice
Crushed ice, rush dis, what da fuck is dis?
You couldn't have a thousand hands and you couldn't touch this
It's that heat nigga, I come to burn up the shit
Let it burn to the ground, put it out with my spit
Ashes to ashes, yo dust to dust
Yo you standin in the way you gettin crushed (crushed nigga)

"Cause we write the records that be rockin every time
 The ones that chase us be like two steps behind" --&gt; KRS-One
(repeat 4X)

[Dug Infinite]
Yo you could take it personal, I take it any way I can
Cause I'm versatile, when I be crashin up your plan
You wanna battle?  Oh you an MC, then where your beats at?
A carpenter, always got tools, at least a chief's hat (hahaha)
Uhh, yeah yeah, I know you got got no cash nigga
Put me in, that position, I'll be the last nigga
Never starvin artist, I never work the hardest
I always work the smartest better hope you ain't my target (nigga)
When I aim, I blow shit up, ask Martino
Keep a killer on my team, like Casino
It's Dug Infinite with No I.D. and Syndicate...
Hot damn hoe, it's gon' be some shit

[Syndicate]
Cause I'm your idol, the highest title, numero uno
Niggaz wish to test me like the ?
Try, but you know that I'm that cocoa, butta brown sister
Kickin up mo' dust than the flusher weighed in Twister
Here to shake the rich I remember when I was younger
what I would be when I grew up is what I wondered
Now you're plundered under, this younger world wonder
Chills, to your soul in the summer

[Dug Infinite]
Now I be tryin to be cool, plus tryin to stay humble
But niggaz take humble like it mean I don't rumble
When I come for your shit, you gon' need more than aid
Cause I'ma invade, like a fuckin renegade (nigga)
You don't like me when I'm angry, cause I attack strangely
Hittin you from miles away, that's how my range be
I'm on solid ground, that you ain't gotta wonder
You on butter nigga when they heat up you sinkin under (whooh!)
See, you don't walk out on me, nigga you crazy
Your shit ain't real, it's a Fugazi

"Cause we write the records that be rockin everytime
 The ones that chase us be like two steps behind" --&gt; KRS-One
(repeat to end)

[Syndicate]
It's a Fugazi!  Hahaha, yo' shit's a Fugazi, hahaha
Yaknahmsayin?  Niggaz stay two steps behind
Yo' shit ain't real it's two steps behind nigga
Remember that, two steps behind, uhh, yeah, uhh
Syndicate, No I.D., Dug Infinite
on some next shit, yeah

[Dug Infinite]
Know they got to admit..
Straight up, straight up
Yeah
That's right
