[Intro]
Operator, here's my dime, connect me please
I know that she's at home...

[Chorus: Kno] 
It's four o'clock on a Sunday morning 
Who the hell is calling my phone? 
Waking me up, I'm stretching and yawning 
If you had any sense, you'd leave me alone 

[Natti]
Wee hours of the morning and, word is bond 
Iâm in jail I need bail again, the word is +Bond+
Not +James+ in a tux with olives draped on my cup 
With a dame all on me with healthy letters to cup 
So whattup?  Can you free me 'fore my prints get back? 
And they run 'em through the system and realize that I'm black 
All I remember was the stripper then I faded to rack 
Said her name was December then she sat on my lap - "Merry Crimmuh" 
Liquor and higher power my witness 
I thought fleeing The People was just a matter of fitness 
With all these nice drinks, compliments of Dennis 
Whoever the fuck that is -- "Dennis is this!" 
Two middle fingers up  -- "Dennis is this!" 
Dennis tab maxed out on titties and fifths 
Whoever the fuck Dennis is, Dennis is pissed! 
Cause I donât think that dude we was drinking with was Dennis at all, fam! 

[Grieves]
Ha~! Yup, I'm aware it's four in the morning 
But I just wanna tell you I'm drunk and I'm kinda horny 
I know it gets annoying, but I been losing my grip 
Every woman I talk to I treat like a fair piss and it's a BITCH!
Mainly cause I now consider you one 
I wanna let you go but every time I seem to screw up 
Now that's the problem with the space that you occupy 
It's going great and then the thought of you would cross my mind 
A box of wine and a carton of Coffin Nails end..
Convince me now would be a great time for hate mailin 
Like, "Hey bitch! How the hell have you been? 
Remember me? We were dating and you slept with my friends!" 
I just thought that I'd remind you in case you ever forget it 
You train yourself to believe that you're not a terrible wretch, ha 
You broke my heart into like a million pieces 
Well here's another dim-litted picture of my penis! 

[Murs]
{*phone text jingle*} WHOA! What the fuck is going on, Grieves?! 
You saved my number under the wrong name in your phone? 
Is that a picture of your...? (Aw shit~!) I'ma pretend I ain't see that 
All that rain got you suicidal up in Seatt-- {*phone text jingle*} 
--ohhhh... You had too much to drink again 
Whiskey and a cellphone ain't never gonna be your friend 
You booze you lose, homie you been warned 
You better off using your cell phone to watch porn 
Grab some lotion and a napkin, jack off then pass out 
All these drunk texts'll have you fucked off and ass out 
I hope you black out before you do anymore damage 
I checked your timeline - homie, why you Tweetin in Spanish? 
I understand if this is what you gotta go through 
But when you sober up, I got some screenshots to show you 
Grieves, bro trust me...
And you gon' be HELLA happy that all of them texts didn't go through

[Chorus]

[Grieves]
HUNH!..Dehg...AH! 
{*camera snaps*} That's the angle!
Hohoheh, she's gonna love that one!</pre>
