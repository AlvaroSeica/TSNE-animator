Chorus x2
I'm in it to deep to get out now
They always told me death was the only way out
I'm sittin' up all night 
I can't ever rest my head
How will my family take it if I ended up dead

(Lord Infamous)
There was a man who approached me every night
When I was reasting fast asleep
He tried to get into my mind
And he promised me power beyond my wildest dreams
He said he could take me away from the suffering, begging, and life of
	a teen
So I had to agree
Theres one catch you must worship throughout the centuries
But I really didn't know he'd be better off
I'm tired of the pain and the crew my brother
He game me things
He promised me
But I got no need I will suffer forever
I'm tired of wrong brotherless powers are much to strong
Oh so bad I want to move on
But if I do my soul is gone
Liars (??) hatas, all murderas, adulterers, and thieves
What you don't know
Is that you're walkin' in the same shoes with me

(Koopsta Knicca)
(??) for seekin' is all I see
He sit close to me
He said Victoria Secrets
Fills up the air
Perfume smells so fucked up
Auick right here with a stare
Buck doggystyle then the chair
Turned her on her stomach as she
Moanin' from the motion
If you ready for this to get (??)
Koop finna to come a little bit closer
Rolled her on her chest before the sound went pop
Then I reached for my heart
Oh my god Koopsta just been robbed
I hope you feel me
I'm playin' naked
Lookin' at the ceilin'
And bloddy me just hear more (?) from the Koopstas

Chorus x1

(Gangsta Boo)
I'm in it to deep
To escapre this kind of drama
Got crossers, playa hatas, and fakers, that equals problems
Today in this day and time
you can't read nobody's mind
These smiles turn to frowns
When they see a playa on the rise
On top of the world
Just a lookin' down and laughin' at'cha
I'll never be popular
Like that 2pac "I ain't mad at'cha"
So baby beware
This game of life is like do or die
It's hell on this Earth
The only thing that's missin' is the fire
Come on baby tell me is it something that your eyes can't see
Or are you just blind
To the fact that you in it too deep

(Juicy J)
Yeah, I know what'cha mean
I had to stand on my ground 
To get on the scene
Just me and brother down in the stuggle
Gettin' out seve on to the friends
And after dark
Deep in the park 
Them doped up fiends will start
To light the pipe all through the night
I used to wonder what God
Please help the poor come off of their feet
Cuz there was nothin' to eat
Didn't want to jack or rob
A brother had to maintain the streets
Off in the projects
Wasn't lathargic
Cause I was tryin' to get out
Who can you tust
I had to be tough
I never ran my mouth
My and my crew would constantly hit the brew
A natural high
how can you make it in this world
But to try of die

(DJ Paul)
1991 was the year 901
Was the area code
3-8 double 1-6 was the zip
Code of all the rows of road
Now let my story be told
A yong buck droppin' on in a school house
But not to learn off in the tenth grade
Tryin't o come up at last
Like a total outcast
Off all them songs I done made
Bumpin' my underground tapes
Up and down the hall
The DJ Paul wasn't no damn thang
But then my dogs
Tony and Shista asked me to join a gang
Theat ain't me man
but hangin' around them fools
I had to get down and join a click, see
Cause I made so many enemies
From the clicks off in my city
Now if I told you what gang it was
Then to you I will seem more than down
But if I told you what gang I'm in
I can only do a show off in my own town
But it's all goody good
Much love to the thugs in my hood
And in my city much respect
I'm wit'cha for life
And as you could bet
We lights one up today

Chorus...till fade
