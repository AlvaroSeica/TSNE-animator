Alright so this is a song about, anyone, it could be anyone
You're just doing your own thing and someone comes out the blue
They're like, "Alright, What ya saying, Yeah can I take your digits?"
And you're like, "No, not in a million years, you're nasty, please leave me alone."

Cut to the pub on our last night out
Man at the bar 'cause it was his shout
Clocks this bird and she looked okay
She caught him looking and she walks his way

[Woman] Alright darling, you gonna buy us a drink then?
[Man] Err no, but I was thinking about buying one for your friend

She's got no taste 
Hand on his waist
Tries to pull away but her lips on his face

[Woman] If you insist I'll have a white wine spritzer
[Man] Sorry love, but you ain't a pretty picture

Can't knock 'em out, can't walk away
Try desperately to think of the politest way to say (sorry, but no)
"Just get out my face, just leave me alone"
And no you can't have my number (Why?)
'Cause I lost my phone.

Oh yeah, actually yeah I'm pregnant
I'm yeah I'm having a baby in like 6 months so no, yeah, yeah...

I recognise this guy's way of thinking
As he comes over her face starts sinking
She's like "Oh here we go.."
It's a routine check that she already knows
She's thinking: "They're all the same."

[Man] Yeah you alright baby? You look alright still, yeah what's your name?

She looks in her bag
Takes out a fag
Tries to get away from the guy on a blag
Can't find a light

[Man] Here use mine
[Woman] You see the thing is I just don't have the time

Can't knock 'em out (You can't knock 'em out)
can't walk away (and you can't walk away)
Try desperately to think of the politest way to say
(Err I'm really sorry, but not this time)
"Just get out my face, just leave me alone"
And no you can't have my number
'Cause I lost my phone.

Go away now, let me go
Are you stupid or just a little slow?
Go away now I've made myself clear (I don't think so)
Nah it's not gonna happen
Not in a a million years

Can't knock 'em out (You can't knock 'em out)
can't walk away (and you can't walk away)
Try desperately to think of the politest way to say (eerrr)
"Just get out my face, just leave me alone" 
And no you can't have my number
'Cause I've lost my phone.

Can't knock 'em out, can't walk away
Try desperately to think of the politest way to say
(Err actually I'm getting married next year)
"Just get out my face, just leave me alone" (no no seriously)
And no you can't have my number
'Cause I've lost my phone.

Nah I've gotta go cos my house is on fire (laughs)
I've got herpes, err no I've got syphilis
AIDS, AIDS, I've got AIDS! (laughs)
Um I forgot my vagisil, yeah forgot that
Oh shit....</pre>
