Hook 1: Fingazz (Lil' Rob in background)
Go
Hit the floor, hit the floor
Hit the floor, floor
Go
Hit the floor, hit the floor
Hit the floor, floor (Everybody get up)

[Fingazz (Lil' Rob in background)]
"The bang, bang, boogie, the bang, the bang, boogie..."
"The bang, bang, boogie, the bang, the bang, boogie..."
"The bang, bang, boogie, the bang, the bang, boogie..."
"The bang, bang, boogie, the bang, the bang, boogie..." (Everybody get up)

[Lil' Rob]
(Verse 1)
And bang to my newest song
Ain't no way you can do it wrong
Check one, two, one, two, it's on
It don't stop til the thrill is gone (Til the thrill is gone)
Til the break of dawn
Hard like the streets that we're scrapin' on
Times flies, don't be waiting long
Like Rob made you wait for your favorite song
We could bang to the boogie
We could even boogie back to the bang
But fools that don't dance, and taking a chance
Everybody's doing the bang, and I can even explain

Hook 2: Lil' Rob
You can move how you want to (How you want to)
Do your thang, go and move how you want to (You can move how you want)
You can move how you want to (How you want to)
Do your thang, baby, move how you want to (Do it, uh hun)

Chorus: Fingazz (Lil' Rob in background)
"The bang, bang, boogie, the bang, the bang, boogie"
"The bang, bang, boogie, the bang, the bang, boogie" (Everybody get up)
"The bang, bang, boogie, the bang, the bang, boogie"
"The bang, bang, boogie, the bang, the bang, boogie" (Everybody get up)

(Verse 2)
And bang to the beat like so
He bangs to the beat like a pro
She
Bangs to the beat like whoa
And they
Bang to the beat like no
No
They gots to chill
How they supposed to chill when you can't sit still
And that's for real
Good times, homie, that's the deal
Don't be a fool and act too rude
Don't wanna be wasting your time
If you didn't want through the door to hit the dance floor
Then why you'd bother waiting in line, you must be out of your mind

Repeat Hook 2

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 3)
[Fingazz]  I'm a
[Lil' Rob] Bang, bang, to the boogie song
           Yeah, she knows the boogie song
           She says that's her favorite song
           You can bang, bang to it all night long (All night long)
           Yeah, that's how she's doing it
           She's got a bangin' body, and they love how she's movin' it
           She bangs so hard, all the homies are losing it
           I hope nobody trips and the party ruins it
           So get up off your seat
           Move your body, make sure you movin' your feet
           And
           Up jump the rhythm to the boogie that bang, bangs
           The rhythm of the boogie, the beat (Everybody get up)

Repeat Hook 2
