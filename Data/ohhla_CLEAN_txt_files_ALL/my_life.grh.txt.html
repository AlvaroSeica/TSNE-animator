you say it ain't my life
it don't really mean shit
but if you think for a minute
then it fits

you don't remember the fight
theres no high in sight tonight
but if your payin the price
your checkin it twice

you say it ain't my life
it don't really mean shit
but if you think for a minute
then it fits

you don't remember the fight
theres no high in sight tonight
but if your payin the price
your checkin it twice

huh
I wanna take it when I make it so I take it in
and when I speak it hope it reaches so you freak and then
you go and share it cause you care and they can see it in
the reaction satisfaction when we teach these men

it comes from deep within
I cannot keep it in
I do not celebrate sin
I do not harbor hate

ive got a larger fate then a mansion
in a farther place then the hamptons
and if you can all relate put ur hand in
your more than welcome
the guest list is for all
I bless this and call
all my homies to help me stand tall
cuz I can fall back with my eyes closed
and get caught and rise
and hope that all shit talkin dies
id rather have a healthy life then a wealthy wife to take from
and if nobody ever gave a shit then I would make one
and then another for my brother but only once
each one teach some no love for it dunce

you say it ain't my life
it don't really mean shit
but if you think for a minute
then it fits

you don't remember the fight
theres no high in sight tonight
but if your payin the price
your checkin it twice

you say it ain't my life
it don't really mean shit
but if you think for a minute
then it fits

you don't remember the fight
theres no high in sight tonight
but if your payin the price
your checkin it twice

can you feel it in the air or just a cold stare?
I try and row near my family but I hold dear
I got this whole fear lookin foolish when I soul share
you tryin too hard just to rule us with that bold flare
quit the laughin how I'm actin isnt so rare
if I was mackin full of passion id go no where
whoa there
I grab the horsey by the riens
and tell him take me to the kingdom
where no one is feelin pain
and everyones got a name
beautiful to match the face
where the world is not a race
till the finish were enjoying this place
evoiding this space
utilizes mind
till the fullest thats the coolest
now lets just to do this
tables seem stable people
who speak powerful
cowards you can leave and
get devowered by the greive
and feed off machines
collect that green collect that green
me, I wanna breathe in

you say it ain't my life
it don't really mean shit
but if you think for a minute
then it fits

you don't remember the fight
theres no high in sight tonight
but if your payin the price
your checkin it twice

I don't wanna be treated like a king
all I do is rap
cant even sing
and when I think of that it stings
collect my little scratch
and travel across the map
babble and toss em back
and fools is lovin me for that
like they lovin the shaq attack
and girls for bein stacked
lovin to smoke a sack
but I broke it down to the fact that
nobody loves a stranger
and everybody stays within a range
of themselves and what pertains to them
but if we change it then
we will see the strangest grins
maybe aim to kin
everywhere you go I feel the ones
who are in to know are already peepin
I watch and understand and grow
and I give thanks for that no sleepin
I watch and understand and grow
and I give thanks for that no sleepin

you say it ain't my life
it don't really mean shit
but if you think for a minute
then it fits

you don't remember the fight
theres no high in sight tonight
but if your payin the price
your checkin it twice

you say it ain't my life
it don't really mean shit
but if you think for a minute
then it fits

you don't remember the fight
theres no high in sight tonight
but if your payin the price
your checkin it twice
