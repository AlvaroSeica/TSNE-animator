[Chorus]
Multi... Multi... ("Multi!")
'Til the motherfuckin sun die, 'til the motherfuckin sun die
One time for Multi... Multi... ("Multi!")
'Til the motherfuckin sun die, 'til the motherfuckin sun die
One time for Multi

[Big K.R.I.T.]
I did it for the people that believe in me
Never shine on my family cause that could breed envy
Friends up and turned foes and I done seen plenty
Cause loyalty is all we had and I believed in it
I cain't deny that, most don't survive rap
Plus bein po' wasn't easy and we survived that
Too many times I left home and had to drive back 
Cause deals fell through, instead of beats 
they'd rather buy a sack... Multi since '86
A lot of motherfuckers out chea hated this
To see a king from the bottom  
A country bumpkin from nothing, Good Lord you know I got 'em, right?
So put your lighters in the air for me
If I'm down I pray you care for me
This for them fans everywhere for me
Thank God that they were there for me

[Chorus]

[Big K.R.I.T.]
Ain't no secret I'd ride for it
If need be, I'll die for it
My plane could crash and burn but I'll fly for it
Fight the power, raise my fist in the sky for it
I put my brothers on, divide the pie for it
Then get it poppin like the 4th of July for it
You cain't low ball, I want the high-high for it
My grandma died knowin that I tried for it
Many nights alone, yeah I cry for it
Seventeen, hit the road, made a drive for it
Pedal CDs' out the trunk, break my pride for it
Apply for a job, just to get denied for it
So many tries to sign but I decide for it
On the stage of life titans still collide for it
Last song, breath gone, stage dive for it
Say goodbye, close my eyes for it

[Chorus]

[Outro: Miya Bailey]
Be just and justify your actions
Breathe deep and walk up right
Lead and never follow
Love the people, be of the people
Humble yourself and pray
History remembers kings</pre>
