Typed by: Lil Hustle

[Intro]
But we are apposed around the world
By a monolithic, and ruthless conspiracy
That relies primarily on covet means
For expanding it's share of influence
An infiltration, instead of invasion
A submersion, instead of election
Intimidation, instead of free choice
And gorillas by night, bombing by day

[K-Rino]
What are the causes and disease, of depression
Who's ultimately effected, these are the questions
We all stand guilty, and in need of a blessing
So we weave through the scriptures, to read as a reference
Foundations were laid, years ago etched in
Neglecting rejection, sent you in that direction
Your heart was exposed, with no type of protection
The innocence you displayed, was met with aggression
Lethal injection, to my trust in the masses
In the vein of my good side, the needle was casted
Seeking to find peace, in the hour of madness
Trying to stop adding bricks, to my tower of sadness
Everyday the hurt builds, deeper and deeper it drills
Nobody is understanding, so I keep it concealed
All these artificial people, say they keeping it real
False happiness and alcohol, reefer and pills come on

[Chorus]
Trying to find my way, through all this darkness in my life
In the meantime until that day, I keep running towards that light
And even if I don't succeed, at least I know I did my best
All day long I keep on running, till I reach that happiness...happiness

[K-Rino]
They sit watching me closely, hesitant to approach me
Hoping that I let a professional, diagnose me
Instead of communicating, they wait to sedate me
Making me deflate, to unsafely medicate me
And turn me to a vegetable, with anti-depressants bro
A cocktail of Paxil, Zoloft and Lexapro
The Prozac and Zimbalta, make my moods alter
Not only mentally, but my physical started to falter
So hard oh Lord, no money no job
Won't starve, options sell dope go rob
Can't seem to get no, peace of mind it's so
Chaotic and frustrating, borderline schizo
Deal with it get help, must make a fast choice
Conversations in my head, good voice bad voice
Don't jump jump now, somebody come help me
I just wish the me in my own head, would accept me

[Chorus]

[K-Rino]
Mind state not good, hurting since childhood
Over time your heart, got harder than plywood
Trying to avert war, peace is what you search for
Things from your parents, constructed the first floor
From love they disarmed you, the drugs only harm you
The mental facilities they build, don't reform you
Every night you fight to, not use the rifle
Your offspring ass, is the generational cycle
If tears could come out of my eyes, I woulda been cried
They must be going backwards, and drowning me from the inside
Depression is testing me, a real problem I might have
Stress is an ocean, and I'm floating on a life raft
Prayers in my head, but I'm too shook to dial one
Everybody claim they got faith, until the trial come
Long as you live, you gon' have to face a lot of tests
You can take God all day, with no side effects

[Chorus]</pre>
