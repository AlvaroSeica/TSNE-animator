[Verse 1]
I was walking down the street, Adidas on my feet
This kid started sweating and it wasn't from the heat
Started getting real loud, attracting a crowd
His boys were all around so i guess it made him proud
He kept advancing, and his friends did the same
I told the kid that i didn't even know his name
But this kid, kept saying what I did
And he was real thick just finished his bid
He had about 15 of his sons on his side
I only had one friend and that was my pride
I figured if I hit this kid in the face for talking
They'd break both my legs and I wouldn't be walking
I'm contemplating this is the situation I'm hating
Pretty son my face and the ground  will be relating
Just then, I looked around them and saw 20 men 
Heading my direction surrounding
Hell yeah, my whole teams coming for me
And my team will blow their team out of the category
Since I saw all my friends approaching the place
I, spit on the bitch and punched him in the face
Then his whole crew, beat me black and blue
My face had contact with everybody's shoe
All my friends stood around watching it happen
Nobody even made a slight effort of attacking
I could not believe it, I thought I had friends
It turns out they were really cowards in the end

(Chorus)
I thought you had my back
When I'm under attack
Didn't happen like that
Where's my real friends at
They all turned out to be soft in the end
I guess i was betrayed
"I thought you were my friend"

[Verse 2]
I was fucking with this girl, and everybody knew it
My Dick she always blew it get it get it go to it
And that's what I did, and that's how it went down
Little did I know that on the other side of town
She was dating this guy, by the name of Big Tie
Rumor has it that the man stood 10 feet high
One day, she called and said come play
So I brought 10 friends and try to help them get laid
We went to her apartment and everything was all right
She started stripping for us not a problem in sight
But just then, Big Tie bust in
His girl was blushing, and I was flushed then
Tie had about 5 men with him
Since I had all 10 let the battle begin
Before a fight broke out, my friends broke out
They said "All right man, we'll catch you later kid no doubt"
They ignored my friends and jumped all on me
I was out for the count and really bloody
They were very hostile, I woke up in the hospital
I was told every bone in my body was broke a little
All my friends that ran, as fast as they could
Just like little bitches and it wasn't understood
They came in the room saying get well good luck
I told them get out of here, and shut the fuck up
I could not believe it, i thought i had friends
It turns out that they were really cowards in the end

(Chorus)

[Verse 3]
Once upon a time on a very nice day
I was playing ball on the court around the way
We got them and started everything was going great
I had 7 friends and this kid had 8
This one one kid kept on fouling my man
I said please don't do that shit, understand
Then he said all right and laid back low
Next thing you know my man caught an elbow
I said "Damn son should have listened to the prophet"
He said "I'm gonna do it again, you gonna stop it"
I looked at my team, then back on him
I figured now's about the time to let the beating begin
I waited for a second, nobody made a move
I'm thinking if a fight breaks out what will it prove?
Before I had time to let the beef cook
Out of no where I caught a left and a right hook
I was still standing, started throwing fist back
Lots of blood flying and lots of contact
I let go, only had 2 fists to throw
Suddenly 16 fists coming, "Oh no"
I looked at my friends as I started to fall
All I heard was, "Lets go grab the ball"
I woke up later stuck to the concrete
The blood was all dry, guess I met my defeat
I could not believe it, I thought I had friends
Turns out they all cowards in the end

(Chorus)</pre>
