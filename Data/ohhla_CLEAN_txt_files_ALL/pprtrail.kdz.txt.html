Song:   Paper Trail
Typed by: timm2014@hotmail.com

[Chorus] [Nawlage]
Paper trail stay fallin' from the sky
Get away in that cherry bubble I
Pop the cork, say just raise your glass high
Spark the doobie, we about to get high
Money on my mind, about to get rich
We young tycoons on a platinum trip
From Parii to uh, Tokyo to uh
New York to uh, Chicago and uh
Miami to the D town
Cause everywhere we go you know we puttin' it down

[Verse One] [Nawlage]
It's like 
Easy does it
This here be a doosie 
My verbal treat a Double O snare like a floosy
Slide inside, then on to the next one
Spit that futuristic shit, George Jetson
Ultimate Fighter, ultimate writer
Stadium flow is made for cigarette lighters
Behind mics my live punch light
I'm Kimbo Slice
Invoke nice
Second to none
Bump gums like the set of Nick Teen
Nick Green with a sweeter sixteen and
Little Aaron Reed on MTV
Caviar in the form of an MP3
Made in conjunction with the real
Hand delivered down from Heaven underneath
Mr. Jabari Evans and 

[Chorus]
Paper trail stay fallin' from the sky (pick it up)
Get away in that cherry bubble I
Pop the cork, say just raise your glass high
Spark the doobie, we about to get high
Money on my mind, about to get rich
We young tycoons on a platinum trip
From ATL to uh, VA and uh
Berlin to uh, Dub A and uh
Seattle to the H town
Cause everywhere we go you know we puttin' it down

[Verse Two] [Phonte]
It's Phon
Tiggalo the show stopper
You and your crew look so opera
I'm in Osaka
Lettin' 
The beats bang till I'm hard of hearing
Make the ear ring/earring just like some door knockers
I
Always got to do my job and stay on top of my
It wasn't written little nigga, it was prophesied
In '03 I dropped The Listening and 
It took me from Paris to New York to Michigan and
Niggas thought that we would get dropped
But I just made a pit stop
Retire/re-tire like the Michelin Man
Now I'm back on the track like Ricky Bobby and I
Piss excellence, to step to this you outta your mind
Me and Nawlage the team 
It's a movement but nah
We need class participation
Raise your hands to the sky
Let's go

[Chorus]
Paper trail stay fallin' from the sky (pick it up)
Get away in that cherry bubble I
Pop the cork, say just raise your glass high
Spark the doobie, we about to get high
Money on my mind, about to get rich
We young tycoons on a platinum trip
From Parii to uh, Tokyo to uh
New York to uh, Chicago and uh
Miami to the D town
Cause everywhere we go you know we puttin' it down

[Verse Three] [Nawlage]
A shot of brilliance
Chased with some excellence
Heavy on je ne sais quoi
Translation
I'm somethin' like a star
When it comes to the verbal spar
Ride tracks sorta like a Nascar
Limited time only
?
Take a rain check on the lame trip
Catch me on the ? sippin' Cabernet
Eatin'
Salmon fillet with peach jelly glaze
Strictly on some player shit
I'm not pardoning this
But I got no synonyms just to say the shit
I'm on my P's &amp; Q's
Cross T's, dot I's
See the hunger runnin' south side in my brown eyes
Not sayin' that I was poor
But I was sayin' I could always use more

[Chorus]
Paper trail stay fallin' from the sky (pick it up)
Get away in that cherry bubble I
Pop the cork, say just raise your glass high
Spark the doobie, we about to get high
Money on my mind, about to get rich
We young tycoons on a platinum trip
From Parii to uh, Tokyo to uh
New York to uh, Chicago and uh
Miami to the D town
Cause everywhere we go you know we puttin' it down

All over the world</pre>
