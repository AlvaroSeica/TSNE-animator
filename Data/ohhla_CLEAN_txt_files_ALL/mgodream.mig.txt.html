[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Slide in the pussy like a surfboard
Killing these niggas get a hearse for 'em
Fuck you niggas even sellin work for
You next to tell put your chirp on
Be the main reason pussy niggas gettin' murked for
Young nigga who you work for
Cause I came from the bosses I ain't for no losses you play in this dirt for 'em
And I came from the first floor
Gangbanging hoes like a turf war
Then hit the road for my first tour
My level went up to the third floor
And I swerved on these hating niggas
MIA, with some Haitian niggas
Bad bitches keep takin' pictures
I pulled up in that ransom nigga like whoa

[Hook: Quavo]
Let me talk Meek Mills
I bet you didn't know my niggas make millions
It's sad to say some of my niggas convicted to prison
When you at the top you don't want to look down, you don't want to look down
In a submarine under water, you don't know how I'm feeling right now

[Verse 2: Quavo]
All of my life I ain't wanted nothing but Franklin
Touchdown on a fuck nigga make him tuck in his shell like he Franklin
You and my niggas are not the same
I jumped out the Lamb like Bruce Wayne
The ten piece of chicken is on the way
I told 'em Carlito to andale
You see them new niggas in the back of the club
Just look at them plottin' in conversations
I know they don't know
Send the Migos to come back to the bando for translation
Camera rollin' Quavo's Spike Lee
Heroin black like Willie B
If you do the coke you gon' buy some skis
If you in the trap you gon' buy some ki's

[Hook: Quavo]
I bet you didn't know my niggas make millions
It's sad to say some of my niggas convicted to prison
When you at the top you don't want to look down, you don't want to look down
In a submarine under water, you don't know how I'm feeling right now

[Verse 3: Takeoff]
Young Takeoff I am a professional
Vegetarian I only eat vegetables
I got some kush you can roll up
And I got some kush you can eat that is edible
Stretching the work like I'm Mr. Incredible
You ain't never seen no work as flexible
When I turn on the stove &amp; I'm whippin' a brick better pray my niggas turn to predators

[Verse 4: Offset]
I bet you didn't know I was 22 when the judge ten times what a miracle
Me and my son identical
Seventeen years old I had him I didn't know what to do
I had to put food on the plate
Asking the Lord give a nigga some faith
Now when I wake up I look at my label
My foot on the pedal not touching the brake
No chess but nigga I got me a check!

[Hook: Quavo]
I bet you didn't know my niggas make millions
It's sad to say some of my niggas convicted to prison
When you at the top you don't want to look down, you don't want to look down
In a submarine water, you don't know how I'm feeling right now</pre>
