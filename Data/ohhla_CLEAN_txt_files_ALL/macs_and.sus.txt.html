[Prime Suspects]
Chorus
Pack the Lac's with mac's and choppers, it's goin down
Stand tall with your backs against the wall and lay em down
I ain't trippin if I die tonight, my mind ain't right
Down my round and now your family goin bleed tonight x2

[New 9]
Pack the Lac's with mac's and choppers, it's goin down
Stand tall with your backs against the wall and lay em down
Get the kids from around because we settin it off
Sawed offs, mac's and choppers, niggas downtown here let's get off
Niggas kill my round so retaliation is what we know
I ain't scared to go, smokin a cho, I'm a let some rounds go
Spittin that and hittin niggas at the same time
My mind kinda fucked up while I'm screamin (what nigga, what nigga)
Out of all the hustles, shit nigga, I picked coke
Nigga tried to rob my nigga, and kill him cause he ain't give him the dope
Now what you know, how you wanna nigga to cope with that
Get the gats, make em rat to the tat tat, cause it's choppers and mac's
Didn't know we was coming back like that quick
Hit you and your partners wig split
So they can't come back and get who did it
All this shit happens uptown cause they kill my round
Shit nigga, pack the Lac with mac's and choppers cause it's going down

Chorus

[Uzi]
Jumping in the hot Lac with a point to prove
Bumpin pass me them things when you see them they lose
Benefit, poppin out the ride I got butterflies
See them scary motherfuckers look em dead in the eye
Uzi man got to touch ya ain't no love for ya
I got the spirit of my nigga laying dead in the gutter
Got the bustin by moon in the broad daylight
Facing life, I'm a soldier willing to die for what's right
Flags spinnin at him, caught four did him wrong
Bust your dome, now I'm breakin, shakin, headin on home
Smokin on that California to relieve my stress
Know them coppers coming at me so I'm wearin my vest

Chorus

[Glock]
Can it be my life so trife with all the hustles and flights
Shit still ain't right, got me gattin tonight
I gots to take it to you with the head buster let's do this right
My mind set em down bad but the same time I'm hollerin fuckin why
See I moves in the night where shit be kinda tight
Splita splita wig, here I'm fixin to put a niggas life
You had it coming so don't be lookin funny
Nigga ??? rock, now lay it down my only want it
You shot the dice, now we jumpin back up on it
Realizing to yourself you can't fuck with niggas who hungry
Now I'm repped out
Got my name ringin, got your people spooked out
Heard it was niggas in all black steel toes trooped out
Now your in position to feel crushed by niggas too real
Straight warriors, gettin it how they live

Chorus x2</pre>
