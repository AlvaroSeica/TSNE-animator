Bridge One (Cris-Style):

Make it wobble, make it flex
Drop it like it's hot, drop, drop it like it's hot
Won't you bend it over and touch your toes
Drop it like it's hot, drop, drop it like it's hot

(2x)

Chorus (Cris-Style):

Make it wobble, make it flex
Love it when your body's shakin' in that dress
Won't you bend it over and touch your toes?
Baby won't you drop like it's hot like whoa

(2x)


First Verse (5th Ward Weebie):

I'm bout to give it to 'em raw hoe!
Love it she work it and shake it and grab the wall hoe!
Ooh baby now drop it and pop it and take it off hoe!
Shake ya leg with it
Drop a lil' lower now hit my head with it
I'ma make you show your thong hoe!
Make you hoes get naked on the stage when you hear this song hoe!
Fuck it up for me, give lil' Weebie what he want hoe!
Get my dick hard
Get'cha pussy moist and take it to the fifth Ward
I'ma make it work, ooh

Bring it to me if you don't want it watch me get on in it
Watch lil' Weebie work it from the back hoe!
Who be on the track hoe??!!

Chorus

Second Verse (Mista Menor):

Now bend it over for me, work it twerk it for me
It be that skinny red nigga out that P-N-C
Pop it drop it for me, titty bop it for me
I be that bald head nigga out that seventeen
And I love to seem them do they thang
Bend over and let it hang
I'ma call Del and we can hook up a sharin' thang
Bring all your girls, we gone rock all they Worlds
Don't forget the K-Y, we gone need all that oil
I'm tryin' to grease and please, you tryin' to pop with Tee
If you wit it we can split, baby girl we can leave
Shit, shake what'cha got, twerk, twerk what'cha got
We can bounce from the club all the way to the block

Chorus

Third Verse (Kangol Slim):

She touch her toes and watch her go
She shake it like a pro
When she pop with it, love it when she hit the floor
And make 'em bop with it
C'mon Baby girl drop it like it's hot with it
Now watch her go
She shake it like a pro
When she pop with it, love it when she hit the floor
And make 'em bop with it
C'mon Baby girl drop it like it's hot with it
She said she like Fifth Ward Weebie
And the group called P-N-C
Baby after this we can leave
Baby girl me and you can creep
I said this girl is off the chain
Go head Baby girl do your thang
We can flex and make it swang
Maybe after this me and you can hang
