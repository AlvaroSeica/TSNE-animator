Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
They don't even see you like I do
First thing when you wake up
Before you put on your make up
And they don't really know you like I do
Cause with me you ain't the same
You ain't gotta run no game
Girl cause what you do and what I do ain't different
We both on a mission
I love your ambition
And I know how it's to hit the track and hit the ground
And you know what it is to hit the stage and make it pop
Like damn I hope somebody spend some money today
And I pray nobody come and try to take it away
Cause I'm just out here doing what I gotta do
Cause all these fuckin bills are due
And I see all this money to make
So girl you know that

[Chorus]
I ain't judging you
Go and get your money, got and get your money, go and get your money
Baby I salute
Go and get your money, got and get your money, go and get your money
Make that money girl it's yours
Spend that money girl it's yours
You work hard for all of it, it's yours
Work that body baby it's yours
I ain't judging you
Go and get your money, got and get your money, go and get your money

[Verse 2]
Single mother and child, working hard for them dollars
Girl we got something in common
Making money with vowels
See you pussy poppin that onyx
Keep it clappin that magic
Got them niggas tricking that chalice
Come on making this happen
Girl I love seeing your back bend
They cashing out and you cash in
They going broke and you workin
Back broke when you twerkin
I know how hard this shit can be when income is uncertain
Hardly just to make a way
I know you're thinking
Damn I hope somebody spend some money today
And I pray nobody come and try to take it away
Cause I'm just out here doing what I gotta do
Cause all these fuckin bills are due
And I see all this money to make
So girl you know that

[Chorus]
I ain't judging you
Go and get your money, got and get your money, go and get your money
Baby I salute
Go and get your money, got and get your money, go and get your money
Make that money girl it's yours
Spend that money girl it's yours
You work hard for all of it, it's yours
Work that body baby it's yours
I ain't judging you
Go and get your money, got and get your money, go and get your money</pre>
