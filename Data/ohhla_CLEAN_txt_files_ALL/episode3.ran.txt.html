The Year, 20XX
When we last left Mega Ran, he was forced to make a very difficult decision
Didn't know who to trust
Sometimes the uncertainty of life can lead one in a strange direction

And now, Mega Ran and K-Murdock and present...
Forever Famicom

Is it a bird, is it a plane, is he insane, probably,
all the above all of the scrubs and gamers right beside he,
What do ya know? what did he do? Come back to the lane
where he gained his most fame, by rapping bout them games
He was ready to quit, the first was a one shot deal
But the big wigs got word of the style and the skill
Now everywhere he goes people ask him the same exact
Question "When you gonna do some more gamer rap?"

Now what we gonna do right here is go back,
or forward, I'm not even sure, I'm losing track
somewhere between tomorrow and yesterday
a new chapter begins, so wipe the rest away!

When we last left mega ran- he was in a quandary
brother tried to talk to him he said don't even bother me
He was caught between a hard place and a rock
and was starting to lose faith in the doc
Doubted his purpose lost faith in a lot
Walked off and never solved the case so it's locked
Still had mega dreams of escapin the block
But he had to prove no one was Takin his spot
Then he met a man, his name was k murdock
Played him a couple tracks and they were hot
With the vibe that strong
Inspired him to put the blue helmet back on make some new rap songs
But whadya know it wasn't a foe that he was used to chasing down
They attacked the industry for promoting and marketing
Music that was tepid and bland
Had to rep for the fans, got off stage and stepped in the stands
So I won't be back to robot city for a minute
cuz I got a new fight, and every intention to win it
Dig it? Splendid, now pick up the paddle
We got a war to win, so get equipped for the battle
yeah..

Now what we gonna do right here is go back
or forward, I'm not even sure, I'm losing track
somewhere between tomorrow and yesterday
a new chapter begins, so wipe the rest away!</pre>
