"Thats the shit.
Twiztid, Twiztid givin them wigsplits.
Wigslpits, wigsplits.
Twiztids givin wigsplits."

[Jamie Maddrox]
We cracked yo head in half.
Wasn't shit funny but we laughed.
Twiztid runnin this bitch for 9 dash.
A car crashin no equivlant.
We far from innocent.
Crossin the valley and we is ignorant.
Actin baligment on a daily.
When that somebody is somethin, but I guess Im dead wrong.
All by myself.
Fuck everyone else im in a hole.
And I cant breath my lungs swoll.
Bad dreams when Im sleepin.
Everybody constantly creepin.
Feelin so weak I cant see them.
My conscience keeps leavin me fallin in and out.
Wakin up in puddles of sweat and kottenmouth.
Them down south niggas dont know about this.
The niggas on the west side wait to piss.
Because these east side niggas keep talkin hardcore shit.
Enough to give the northside head, WE THE SHIT!
We legit like a motha fucka.
Chillin with million dollar peoples.
Diggin up graves actin evil.
You lookin for the sequel.
More like somethin close to equal.
?You rappers dont even seek em?.
You bitches in toledo what?.

[Chorus 4x]
Die!
Die!
Die Motha Fucka 
Die Motha Fucka 
Die!

[Monoxide Child]
Smoke to many cigerettes and get high to much.
Dont work enough, shit is to rough.
I could give a fuck less if the whole world blow up.
Or what gangsigns niggas throw up.
Im to fed up to keep my head up.
So I let it drag.
Cant afford a belt so my pants sag.
Everybody seems to be a fag or a lesbian.
But what the fuck happen.
Is what Im questionin.
The president is predjudice against you and me.
Takin half our money.
And he chillin tax free.
And if you ask me thats another smack in the face.
We need to burn the white house and piss in his face.
And every judge should do a twenty to life.
If they think they should take tell me that aint right.
And every cop should be beat like rodney king.
Nonstop from the summer till the turn of spring.
Shove a dounut in they mouth and a badge in they ass.
Because the pigs dont get no class.
They get they wigsplit.

[Chorus 4x]

[Monoxide Child]
Now like I was tellin bout peace.
Fuck you and I hope you die.
In a casket where I lie.
And burn my body so I wont attract flies.
In my eyes a look a terror cold as ice.
So what if I slit my wrist once or twice.

[Jamie Maddrox]
Now I could split your wig with my aluminum bat.
Nor I could blow your eardrums with my braindead rap.
You could call it this or that.
But I sway to the other.
Word the monoxide child my brother.
No other to represent this.
After blessin, knowledge full twiztid education I got the lesson.
Bloody textbook.
Kill the next motha fucka that look.
Always shakin never shook yet.
Get your wigsplit bitch and we out.
Get your wigsplit bitch and we out.
Get your wigsplit bitch and we out.
Tell these motha fuckas what we talkin bout!

[Chorus 4x]</pre>
