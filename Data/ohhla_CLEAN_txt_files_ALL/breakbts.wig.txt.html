[Shawn Wigs]
I break beats, Wigs, I'm the 45 King
Part gorilla, I ain't pushing nuthing but a g thing up
Six or better, dirty seude ya leather
Nine ruger milli or the all black beretta
I know better, watch me set it off, I suggest though
You run home and get your vest-o
Because I love Just' motto, half as long, twice as strong
Darts come at you like harpoons, leave you scar wounds
These rap goons, cutting like half moon
Ceasers, crucificy the rap Jesus
I hold mics like heavy hand bleeders
Thirsty like a bloodhound, four pound snuck in the club
Surround sound got you looking around, we spit slugs
Bong-buck, buck-ba-buck-bong!</pre>
