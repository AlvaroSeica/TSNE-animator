[Chorus: Big K.R.I.T.]
You thought you were the only one ballin
You thought you were the only one slabbed-out
You thought you were the only pimpin
In the V-I with the broads and they ass out
You thought you were the only one... NAAAAW, playa!
You thought you were the only one... NAAAAW, playa!

[Big K.R.I.T.]
Now I apply pressure, yessir, gold on my dresser
Effortlessly perfected this pimpin to the neck up
And with it, I can wrestle, any pro into a pretzel
Figure-fo', she figure mo' dick might destroy her vessel
Mo-mo-most not the lesser, it's high, just my worth
Cause the last time I tripped over pussy was probably at my birth
And the last time I didn't pop my trunk was probably at my church
But as soon as I left the parkin lot, I maxed it out 'til it burst, uh
Wood grain in my wheel, uh, princess cut in my grill, uh
Butter fly my steak, uh, shrimp and lobster on chill
Do it how I feel, cause doin what you love won't hurt ya
Plus an L7 could never understand the complexity of my circle
or the dynamics of a twerker, or the inner workings of a squirter
It's like chemistry with this codeine, two parts cup, one purple
Three mo' time that's charm, bad bitch on my arm
Come and go as I please, whole world in my palm, nigguh!

[Chorus]

[Wiz Khalifa]
Tehehehe, uh..
Chocolate chip cookies on my tray, true stoner 
I get high just as sure as the sun come up to light up the day!
A real boss up in the game donÂ’t have to pay to play
We burnin down come smoke a pound, I'm just a flight away
I earned the right to say I'm rich off what I write today
And stickin to my cheese like a microwave
Broke niggaz, they don't like us, they don't wanna fight
Shout out to Max cause you could never ride the +wave+ but me I got the title
O.G. kush in my joint, ooh, all my niggaz on point, ooh
Ride and reppin that gang, ooh, T.G.O.D. come join, ooh
You niggaz do a show there and don't get no love
I sell a hundred thousand tickets when I show up...
...They say the game done chaaaAAANGED
Well that mean you need to change too
And stop with all that fuckin hatin..
cause that's what motherfuckin lames do
Tahahaha, uh!

[Chorus]

[Smoke DZA]
Kushed God, bitch, ahhhhh! Riiiiiiiight..
You ain't the only nigga gettin money, got it down to a science
Big nigga, bank teller, think I play for the Giants
Dead fresh, walk by and get a moment of silence
Don't be mad because we livin dog, be mad at the Mayans
Ridin decidin, live maine or peeking
Who said hustlers can't be king?
Wrists got crowns on 'em, bad hoes is beastin mista
Slide the first day, instant upgrade
Thompson my jacket, Black Label my denims
Very rare my kicks, this petty cash that I'm spendin
With the rich folks 'bout to blend-in
Got a obsession for this game, Bob Lemon
Gangsta, hustla, shit I bleed it, keep these niggaz heated
I don't do reservations I walk in and get seated
Ahh, best believe it, this Harlem kid's the meanest
Shrimp and steak'n at the table, smell the smoke but they don't see it, nigga!
Riiiiiiiiight... DZA
