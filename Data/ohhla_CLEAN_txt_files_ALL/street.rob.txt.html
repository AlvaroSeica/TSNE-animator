[Lil Rob]
(Verse 1)
Up in the morning, I start with a joint
Unloaded my cuete with hollow points
These vatos says, "He's coming for me"
You fucking pussy, I'll believe when I see
Hey, why do ride (???) to the bone
When you know that you not, so just leave it alone

(Verse 2)
Ratas, run and tell
Drug dealers on corners, ready to sell
Hey, I'll take a sac
Not (???) cause the vato gots bomb ass weed
Never in classrooms, never in books
He was out in the calles, running from crooks

(Verse 3)
As soon as night time rolls around
I finally lay the bomba down
Runnin' to the pad, grab something to drink
In the troka, into the street
Up to the corner and round the bend
And tell my ruka to jump in

(Verse 4)
Put the 45" into the box
I got to hear something that's really hot
With the one I love, I'm making romance
It's guarunteed that I get in her pants
I know it sounds wrong
Talkin' 'bout on my street days

Break: Lil Rob
Remember when I used to kick back with the homies
Drink somethings right down the street
And tokin' (???) tokin' monsters
Smokin' 'bout a pound of weed
Talkin' about my street days and all my street ways
Keeping it hot like heatwaves, listen to the guitar the key plays
Watchin' out for 5-0's, on the corner drinking like winos
There's nothing I will change about my street days 

(Verse 5)
Put the 45" into the box
I got to hear something that's really hot
With the one I love, I'm making romance
It's guarunteed that I get in her pants
Kissin' her body from head to toe
Round, and round and round, we go

(Verse 6)
Lil Rob in control
Deliverin' from the days of ol'
Control almost
Deliverin' from the days of ol'
Lil Rob, rock and roll
The feeling is there, body and soul
