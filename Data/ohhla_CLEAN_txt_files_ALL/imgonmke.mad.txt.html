[Intro - Skillz - talking]
Yeah
Uh, uh, yeah
Yeah, let's go, uh
Woo!
Uh, yeah
Uh, listen, (show us what the deal), uh, come on

[Verse 1 - Skillz]
Big Dog cut my mic up (turn it up!)
Mike and J cut the lights up (come on)
I'm a raise the heights up
Spit somethin tonight that's gonna lessen my life up
Boy from the hood, your welcome to sit with 'em
I ain't run from the roaches, I made friends with 'em (uh)
My drama, my momma noddin in the kitchen nigga (uh)
And it ain't cause she tired
Got it make it through the fire or get carried out
Outside, it's a new set of shit to worry 'bout
Damn, life ain't playin (uh uh)
And I know it's a God, but I don't feel like I'm prayin
'Round here (woo!), it's like a job to live (come on)
My homey just went home and I ain't talkin about his crib (uh)
If this is what it is (uh), this what they call life (uh)
You might get your mind left (uh, come on), if you don't get your mind right (uh, uh, OH!)

[Chorus - Male singer]
Tryin hard, everyday, strugglin to survive
To stay alive (alive), somehow, someway
I'm gon' make that bread

I'm gon' make it
I done made my mind up
I'm gon' make it
I'm a keep my head up
I'm gon' make it
Say it again
I'm gon' make it
Say it again
I'm gon' make it

[Verse 2 - Skillz]
Yeah, uh, now I done ...
Been broke, been poor
No bread, no eggs, I done been next door (next door, uh)
Next meal I've done been unsure
we call 'em pallets back then, I done been on that floor
I done (uh), seen the good get killed
Y'all drove to the mall, we walked to Goodwill (hey!)
Tryin to get some hand me downs
Wash it twice and wear it, understand me now
And listen, just because I live like this
That don't mean that I want to raise my kids like this (like this, nope)
Roof leakin, water drippin on my sis
George Bush, he ain't never live like this (this)
Uncle Sam (fuck him!), he don't want to see us win
They call 'em projects, cause that's what they are to them
If you down and out, don't go that route
It's the hood, but you supposed to want to make it out

[Chorus]

[Break - Skillz] - 2X - w/ ad libs
See the summers get hot and the winters get cold
And the house need heat, momma open that stove
Every other day, got to wear the same clothes
I don't want to be here, but where else can I go?
