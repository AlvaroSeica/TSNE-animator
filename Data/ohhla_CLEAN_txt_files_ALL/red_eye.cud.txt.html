[Haim]
Love, hate, play this game of give and take
Won't stay, we all make mistakes
I'll say, what a wonderful escape
I erase
Hey, hey, hey

Things get crazy, feel like I'm losing my mind
I don't know what to do
I'm going insane and I really don't know why
There's only one thing to do
I'm floating through the night on a red eye [x2]
[x2]

I can't understand, I don't understand it
The visions in my head
I just can't make sense of it
[x2]

Cause

I can never run [x3]
There's no use for it baby
[x3]

I can never run [x3]
I'm so used to you baby

Things get crazy, feel like I'm losing my mind
I don't know what to do
I'm going insane and I really don't know why
There's only one thing to do
I'm floating through the night on a red eye [x2]
[x2]

Things get crazy, feel like I'm losing my mind
I don't know what to do
I'm going insane and I really don't know why
There's only one thing to do
I'm floating through the night on a red eye [x2]
