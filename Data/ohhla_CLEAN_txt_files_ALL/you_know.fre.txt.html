[Intro: Terra Tory (Timbo King)]
Listen, man, listen
Listen, this C.O.D., b., C.C.F. Division
Killa Beez, holla at your boy, knowhatimean?
We right here, man, just two niggas who that's gon' crush something, man
The building just gon' come the fuck down, man (Division, nigga)
And everything just gon' fall apart, g., knowhatimean?
Anything that's under it is dead, gone
And everything is just gon' be a 'to be continued', youknowhatimean? (Bo King, nigga)
Free Murda, Bo King (aiyo) crush something

[Timbo King]
Aiyo, block work, early morning, rise and shine
When my goons come around, son, hide your shine
Got street smarts, dumb at it, you do the math
Add one burner, automatic, and sum these
Ankle shots, yeah, hit both knees
If Bo gon' blast, then Bo gon' squeeze
Why should I floss when the price cost nothing
Phat whip with the crib, pa, that's nothing
Bitches in the truck, face down, mouth fucking
Nutted on her and climb, yo rest in peace Danny 6-9
Off of Broadway, coke rock the raw way
We in the hallway, all day (all day)
We in the hallway, all day (all day) we in the hallway

[Chorus: Free Murda]
Word to my momma, we murder (murder)
Bo King and Free Murda

[Free Murda]
Yo, got you while you was eating, dog, drop that chalupa
Hungry pig, now watch I shoot ya, that glock to ya
Put shots through ya, that you can't regret
Hollows travel through your body, that can't eject
Now you gotta walk around, looking bad like rejects
Got a thousand niggas gon' get you, that you ain't see yet
Kill all that noise about you was, looking for him
Looking for me, when you was just looking at him
Looking at me, still ain't do nothing
Through all the ice, like you was gon' do something
All you do is nothing, just wasting my time
That shit is terrible, how you just wasted your mind
They say a mind is a, terrible thing to waste
Now you end up with a terrible name to face
Free Murda, niggas acting dumb like they ill
Cuz we murder, when you catch the gun to your grill

[Chorus: Free Murda]
You know how it goes when you take what's mine (what's mine)
Snubnose, facing your spine (your spine)
Word to my momma, we murder (murder)
Bo King and Free Murda

[Timbo King]
Aiyo, amongst murderers, niggas who love to kill
Robbers and thieves, niggas that love to steal
Yeah, you fuck around you can lose your legs
I got cats that'll do you in, the grime Emmy
The nine semi', yeah you don't want it
Fort Knox got dips, we hold knots like jets
Big money bags, chains and whips, bitches like that shit
It's gangsta, Free, stomp with me

[Free Murda]
I'mma walk dogs with you dunny
I'mma show you all shit get ugly
Shoot out in broad daylight when the shit is sunny
Don't wanna die hungry, man, I'm gonna eat before I sleep
Fuck beef until you get paper, reach before you speak
Or make the papers, victim gunned down
By a loose cannon, savage cannon
You'se a snitch, I got more proof, than the average flicker

[Chorus]</pre>
