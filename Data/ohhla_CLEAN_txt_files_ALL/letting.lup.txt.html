[Intro/Chorus - Lupe Fiasco]
(Oh, oh)
Things are getting out of control
Feels like I'm running out of soul
Oh, oh, oh, oh - oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh - oh, oh, oh, oh
You're getting heavy to hold (oh, oh)
Think I'll be letting you go
Oh, oh, oh, oh - oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh - oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1 - Lupe Fiasco]
My self-portrait, shows a man that the wealth tortured
Self-absorbed with his own self, forfeit a shelf full of awards
Worshippin the war ships that set sail on my sea of life
Where I see my own self and wonder if we still see alike
We was tight, seein lights
Speakin right and breathin life
Now I see my demons and barely even sleep at night
I don't get high, life keep me at a decent height
As the old me, I predicted all my recent plights
Exhausted, tryin to fall asleep, lost inside my recent fights
Burdens on my shoulders now, burnin all my motives down
Inspiration dryin up, motivation slowin down

[Chorus - Lupe Fiasco] [Sarah Green]
(Oh, oh)
Things are getting out of control
Feels like I'm running out of soul
Oh, oh, oh, oh - oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh - oh, oh, oh, oh
You're getting heavy to hold (oh, oh)
Think I'll be letting you go
Oh, oh, oh, oh - oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh - oh, oh, oh, oh
[Think I'll be let you go]

[Verse 2 - Lupe Fiasco]
I'm beggin me don't let me go, we vowed/vowel like the letter "O"
To never go our separate ways and spin-off into separate shows
Tired of all the wardrobe changin, playin all these extra roles
Filled with all these different spirits, livin off these separate souls,
Point in life is gettin hollow, can't wait for the exit hole
Give me room, the entry wound, let me in and let me go
So I can roam around this wilderness
See it for what it really is, unprepared and filterless
Magnify the youth in me, alibi the shooting spree
Amplify the revolution, sanitize the lunacy
Strip away the justice, justify the scrutiny
I can see the lasers, shootin out of you and me

[Chorus] - w/ variations

[Break - Lupe Fiasco]
Sometimes I feel like the world
Sometimes I feel alone like, the world, is against me
And everything that I've done, before
I swear we used to be so pure
But we can't be in love no more
'Cause I don't wanna fight this, war
But when I put down my gun
I turn around and pick up one
This Uzi weighs a ton
But I think I'm, done

[Chorus] - w/ variations

[Outro - Sarah Green] - w/ "oh" repeated until the end
Things are getting, getting out of control
Oh, said it feels like
Like I'm running out of soul
You're getting heavy to hold
Think I'll be letting you go
Letting you go</pre>
