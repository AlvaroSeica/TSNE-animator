[Verse 1]
Single mother, Papa Rolling Stone
Rolled away when little man was ten years old
Left a noticeable hole, where her heart had once resided
Tried to hide it with a cold lump of coal
Slowly turned into a woman that she knew before
She was four years old when HER father walked up out the door
And her mother never loved the same again
Now granted, men were in and out her home
But she'd love 'em leave 'em, 'cause her heart of stone
Just would not allow no occupants, and since her love was non-existent
You can bet her daughter missed it
When she'd try to find it all she'd get is
Empty looks, no confirmation
Only complications
Watched her mom become the woman that she ("tried to avoid, she said")

[Chorus]
Do now as I say darling, not as I do
See the way I play kid, not do as I do
Do do dodo do do dodo do do not as I do
Or you'll feel blue

[Verse 2]
But despite her mom's advice
Everybody knows the cycle goes around and around
Little girl is grown now, but she never found
Anybody that could change her back into the woman that she was
Woman that she was, she attempted to instill some values into little man
Never wanted little man to grow up fatherless, but
Showing affection is something that she never bothered with
So little man grew up to be misogynistic
Got a twisted sense of how to love from the way his momma did it
Momma didn't ever set a good example, but she never wanted little man
To end up cold and lonely like she was, wasn't in her plan
Yet here I am...

[Bridge]
It's not possible to teach a kid by preaching
When you do the opposite

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
