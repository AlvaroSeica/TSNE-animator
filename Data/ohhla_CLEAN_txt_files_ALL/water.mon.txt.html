Typed by: AZ Lyrics

See I could take you to the water
But can't help you drink
See I could take you to the water
But can't help you drink

Put your head right
The same night
We're doing everything
To not break
Blood thicker then water
Blood thicker then water
Blood thicker then water
Blood thicker then water
Blood thicker then water
Blood thicker then water
Blood thicker then water

Rich up in that, I triple my net worth
Hopping out the jet, shorty's got that network
Started from a dollar baking soda wishes
When them hollas hitching niggaz turning so religious
Million dollar me is got your baby momma creeping
Money rule her assets, that evil so possessive
Flashing, you know these niggaz
Sloppy and they bogus niggaz
Pass me with them stories, you ain't half of what ya ho is

Get down
Break it down
Shorty love
And I break it down
Thicken the water
Blood thicker the water

See I could take you to the water
But can't help you drink
See I could take you to the water
But can't help you drink

Put your head right
The same night
We're doing everything
To not break
Blood thicker then water
Blood thicker then water
Blood thicker then water
Blood thicker then water
Blood thicker then water
Blood thicker then water
Blood thicker then water

Gotta do it on your own like fucker rings
30 chains on is the cold villas
Stacking money up, I need 4 ceilings
Drinking bottle after bottle, I need 4 chemists
Stacking hoes up, we need 4 sprinters
Versace shit, Silkk the shocker no limit
From the jump start we them cold killers
And you ain't never dumb, you got 4 figures
Pray to God never get deported
Baby go and bust it open, let me pay your mortgage
Jewish marble, I ain't need a carpet
Play the street, I don't need a office

See I could take you to the water
But can't help you drink
See I could take you to the water
But can't help you drink

Put your head right
The same night
We're doing everything
To not break
Blood thicker then water
Blood thicker then water
Blood thicker then water
Blood thicker then water
Blood thicker then water
Blood thicker then water
Blood thicker then water

Ayo I got that M and cheese all over her body
Mac &amp; Cheese 3!</pre>
