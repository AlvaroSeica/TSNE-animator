[Chorus 2X: Solomon Childs]
I love to get to tuggin' on ya hair
I love to get to humpin' on ya ---
And I'm dreamin', but the lord knows
What I would do, if I could get next to one of you

[Solomon Childs]
Let's start with Keyshia Cole, and her chinky eyes
Two tone hair style, maybe Kelly Rowland
Nowadays, Trina ass more swollen than ever
Or maybe butterscotch like Eve
Or petite like Tamia, Hershey chocolate milk
Like LaToya, I'll make strong love to the whole Danity Kane
Open sesame, abracadabra
Nothing seems to work for me
Raven Symone's getting grown, Mariah Carey's getting thick
I'll never sweat a man's chick
But Jay-Z, go 'head and play with it, Beyonce
Slip up and I'mma make her my fiancee
Wake up kissing my pillow, like I'm kissing Fantasia
This is far, from the average love, this is sudden graded
Shit at the carnival with Joan from Girlfriends
Eva Mendez'll be my best friend
Even dream big, like Monique
Gabrielle Union, shit, I'll probably never speak
To Kira, Tyra, atleast they can't say I dream cheap
I'll sing to the lord when you learned the atoms
Under the moonlight, Lil' Kim's attitude
Still get a dude hype, even Oprah's friend Dale
Got some lovely legs, I'll imagine myself married to Rosalina Sanchez
Man, I dream about them all, fuck it, whose delicious
And who --, sharing milkshakes with Kelly Clarkson
Or Carrie Underwood, bring Eva Longoria too and shit on the hood </pre>
