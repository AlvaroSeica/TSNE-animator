[Verse One: Freddie Gibbs]
Said I'm a, rich nigga, and this is for you bitch niggas
Bitch, say fuck the world and everything in it
Got foreigns in the driveway and ain't a thing rented
I drain the main vein in the mouth of main bitches
And lame niggas, stucj on pussy suspensions
I proceed to slip and fall in and out of them draws
Rendezvous with these groupie broads now I'm dodgin their calls
Bet you wish you could be a fly up on my project walls
Servin chucks in my mama driveway started off with a ball fa sho'
The dope boy done graduated to the dope man
Got rich and flipped a rap career off three and a half grams
And ain't no nigga ever gave me shit
I paid the cost so fuck your boss I work for F.G. bitch!
And it's the truth 'cause dick ridin's at an all time fuckin high
So I stay solo let this dolo blow my fuckin mind
The razor blade major paid quick to break a fiend
Takin all fades nigga none of this shit is make believe 
Bitch!

[Chorus: Statik Selektah Scratchin] (Freddie Gibbs) (*Ea$y Money)
N-None of this-N-N-N-"CL Smooth" (Bitch! I said none of this is shit was make believe)
(*Uh! Yeah!) N-N-N-N-N-N-N-None of this is make believe-"CL Smooth" 
(* That S.T. showoff shit!) (I said none of this shit was make believe)
(*Ea$y Money! Island G! Statik Selek!) (N-N-N-None of this was make believe-"CL Smooth)

[Verse Two: Ea$y Money]
None of this is make believe
I can show you it all the biggest doubter I can make believe
Listen to the jewels I'm spittin
The street shit is in my genes homie, it's my true religion
Y'all really bore me on tracks
Soundin really corny on wax 
Frontin like you really went to war or combat
You ignorin all facts, they done put me in a cell like you store your contacts
Rap niggas tell lies
Talk touch but when the beef come, between they legs where they tell lies
S.T. do bids
Hold us down in any prison you sit us in homie you a citizen
Sold drugs like the pharmaceutics
The realest overall like a farmer suited
We the most official, we tote them pistols
And we got flows that's sick too come fuck with us

[Chorus: Statik Selektah Scratchin] (Freddie Gibbs) (*Statik Selektah)
N-None of this-N-N-N-"CL Smooth" (Uh! Bitch! I said none of this is shit was make believe)
(*It's what I'm sayin though!) N-N-N-N-N-N (I said!) None of this is make believe-"CL Smooth" 
(*YOUR WHOLE LIFE'S MADE UP!) (I said none of this shit was make believe)
(*YOUR AN AUTHOR!!! FICTION!) N-None of this is make believe-"CL Smooth" 

[Verse Three: Termanology] (Sample from CL Smooth)
Uh! I take the trees break the trees shake the trees
Quarter pound eighth of trees and (None of this is make believe)
I chased a cat down the block with a .38 special
He was speed walkin lucky he ain't seen a coffin
I really put work in them studios
Where them groupie hoes try and get loose and go out control
If Iraq snuff you or march and they rush you
Or had to gun butt you that just make Term chuckle
I'm the muscle and the brain seein Russia on the plane is amazin
You should try to change your situation
Instagram scams and Twitter altercations
Facebook stalkers y'all mu'fuckers be hatin
Detecs spyin on me chicks get violent on me
Cliques stay wildin homie stiff lames palm they rollies
This rap life is real life all the time my friend
It's Ology I'm known for gettin it in 
Plus!

[Chorus: Statik Selektah Scratchin] (Freddie Gibbs)
N-None of this-N-N-N-"CL Smooth" (Uh! Bitch! I said none of this is shit was make believe)
N-N-N-N-N-N-N (I said!) None of this is make believe-"CL Smooth" 
N-N-N-N-N-N (I said none of this shit was make believe)
None of-N-N-N-None of-N-N-N-None of this is make believe-"CL Smooth") 

[Outro: Statik Selektah]
