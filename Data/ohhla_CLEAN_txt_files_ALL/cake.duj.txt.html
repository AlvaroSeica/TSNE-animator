Chorus:
Hear that stomach rumblin'
Hungry for a piece of that cake
Dope ain't the only form of that hustlin'
Damn, I need a piece of that cake
(repeat)

Verse 1: Rheturik
Take this personal and literal
Don't mean to dishevel you
I'm just taking the top quarter
Of your four-layer devil's food
So take the candles off
But leave the frosting on
Your celebration's belated
I knew this day would come
Rearrange your budgets for marketing and tour support
Big bills, you best believe I'm checking for watermarks
Better off uplinking angelo and wiring it
Or setting up something in the Cayman Islands
Ok, I'm whylin'
But the simple fact is
The other acts you got are out of practice
And hyperactive
Plus slightly faggot
The mic be magic in our hands
That's why we have it
The pressure messes up the tension in your racket
And now it's back to love-love, first game, second set
You spent your whole damn advance
Now it's advantage us
We do this for the love-love
Don't get it tossed or twist
You copped a tennis bracelet
But we cut off your wrist

Chorus

Verse 2: Mojo
Needing the cake
Reason why the rent is late
Pushing stakes
In the hearts of the vampires that's living fake
Spending twenty-one bucks to get a break
Every week now nine to five this ain't no give and take
I'd rather just make music
But it's too difficult
The record deal's elusive like a animal that's mythical
A typical week
Cop a twentysack
If it's good, it's gravy
Fifties or better I need a raise, see
It's crazy
To stay afloat
Cats with cake stay in harmony
I'm standing in line to pick a note
When it's
Filling your coats
And it's
That hope floats
And it's paying a note on a crib that ain't dope
Second-class citizen I just can't cope
Got me drowning in deep water on a hustle from broke

Chorus

Verse 3: Mas D
Two fat chicks hustle to the store to get chips
One crackhead sits on the corner for fix
Three duns beat him down for kicks
Take his two-for-five money
And they buy a nick of that shit
We call it schwag, they think it's chocolate
Everybody get high
Somebody's getting rich
Three good ol' boys eating steaks
Puffing Cubans
The niggas that rolled ÂŒem
Puffing Newp's, eating Cubans
Cops on the strip
Tell ho's to keep it moving
Taxpayer gets locked up for whore-cruising
The cake's still baking
And it ain't too amusing
For those with no slice
Ego get a good bruising
Crime rate high and it's not too confusing
The rich whip cream and the rest just losing
