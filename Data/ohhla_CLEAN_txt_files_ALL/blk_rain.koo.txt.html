(Sample x2)
Hearses, drivin 'round yo house
Voodoo hex
Hearses, drivin 'round yo house
Voodoo hex
Hearses, drivin 'round yo house
Voodoo hex
Y'all don't wanna come play
In the black rain

(Verse 1, Koopsta Knicca)
See prophecies, I can't believe
A journey to the Seven Seas, just you and me
It's nothin but a novelty, that's all I see
That special giiirrrl (That special giiirrrl)
Oh, you worry bout that other man
Please don't do that
I'm breakin Swishers, give me a chance
Please understand
We now step onto foreign land
No breaking that
Just hold my haaannnd (Just hold my haaannnd)
Oh, I deja-vu her once before
It's now fucked over
My country was that Land of Free
But now no mo' (BUT NOW NO MO'!)
We sent so many precious stones
Of gems and gold
It was so cold (Now wheres my gooold)

(Hook)
So won't you come along
And take me to the Promised Land (Hooo-ray)
Take me to other land (Daaarr-lin)
These prophecies just made a man
Through days and niiiights (Say, oh my Lord, why?)
So wont you come along and
(Sample x2)
Hearses, drivin 'round yo house
Voodoo hex
Hearse-Hearses, drivin 'round yo house
Voodoo hex
Hearses, drivin 'round yo house
Voodoo hex
Wouldn't wanna come play
In the black rain

(Verse 2, Koopsta Knicca)
They thunders from afar
Like some cowards know it's dark in this
Ben build, they stance fills they let em off the caucuses
Body counts, talkin about a thou'
But there was millions
Reality hits, better read this
A several paws of childrens
Can you feel me?
Say, who's that beating on the drums?
It's grave, red roses, heart
Now that the place comes
Run along..
For you can't hide, twenty-four hour frame
Jet planes crash, fights
That's what it sounds like
Alright..
Thought that I'd try to give you warning man (Okay)
Streets filled with bodies, haunting, that's so strange (So strange)
All the things we chillen, them homies stay the same
For those who never hear
Whatever, fear
But never seen (Black Rain)

(Hook)
Take me to the Promised Land (Hooo-ray)
Take me to other land (Daaarr-lin)
These prophecies just made a man
Through days and niiiights (Say, oh my Lord, why?)
So wont you come along and take me to the
(Sample x2)
Hearses, drivin 'round yo house
Voodoo hex (Take me to the)
Hearse-Hearses, drivin 'round yo house
Voodoo hex (Take me to the)
Hearses, drivin 'round yo house
Voodoo hex
Wouldn't wanna come play
In the black rain

(Verse 3, Koopsta Knicca)
And this time I'm buzzin and fuckin ready
You'll be blinded by the
Horror stories, torture motives
Tellin I'm on my best
I'm losin my mind, a ghetto is hauntin my head
Interest to the gun, Koop's the one's with the plans
Splittin heads, broken cred's, Wes' sparks by yo bed
You gon' be strong just like a man
And if not he can't be me
Gonna party to the Pheonix with this mines music shit, bitch

(Hook)
Take me to the Promised Land (Hooo-ray)
Take me to other land (Daaarr-lin)
These prophecies just made a man
Through days and niiiights (Say, oh my Lord, why?)
So wont you come along and take me to the

Hearse-Hearses, drivin 'round yo house

Hearses, drivin 'round yo house
Voodoo hex
Wouldn't wanna come play
In the black rain</pre>
