[Intro: Troy Ave]
Aiyyo New York City don't worry I got us!
Troy Ave and BSB is that brand you can believe in
East coast nigga! Anti-weirdo chuck shit
We representin the streets! (Powder!)

[Verse One: Troy Ave]
Rappers want features but there ain't no swap nigga (Nah!)
Pay me motherfucker I'm about my gwop nigga
I'm the talk of the city (Facts) New York savior
My lil brother can't buy no Jordan's with favors
Blowin up, Flex droppin bombs to this
We ain't the same nigga you live with your moms and shit
My bitches like bags and sometimes I buy the shit (Here you go baby!)
But I don't be mad, I stuff that thing high with bricks (Get that money all day)
This that only wight they carry on, I just get my Barry on
Heavy white bass (Whoa) dough runnin marathon (WOO!)
Leader of the race, keep up with my pace (GO!)
You lookin +Weezy+ I get +Cash Money+ in your face
It, niggas is basic I'm more complex
I can hear your rhymes, figure out what comes next 
I'm really livin mines, tryin to figure what comes next
That freshman cover, a major deal, jail or death

[Chorus: Troy Ave]
Brooklyn shit, this is not the norm
This that, safety off, with the engine on
This that, Brooklyn shit, this is not the norm
This that, safety off, with the engine on
This that, Brooklyn shit, this is not the norm
This that, safety off, with the engine on
Mercedes Benz gold watch sittin above the arm
How he got money when, he ain't have a job in so long

[Verse Two: Troy Ave]
Fuck it, Tears of joy in a bucket (Yeah!) 
On the road to success we doin over a hun'ed
Doin this shit you wanted, fuck waitin for turns
Turn my safety off my engine on wouldn't urn
Never lookin for handouts I came to stand out
Represent my city and show what bein a man's 'bout
Niggas dressin pretty they showin you what a scam 'bout
Denims can't be skinny your skirt is worn when a man's out
Miss me with the bullshit get, hit with a full clip
Hand on the bible I don't put niggas on the pulpit
Front roll another, I react you suffer
And that's a fuckin fact you Murda come get these suckers!

[Verse Three: Uncle Murda]
(GMG!) I run New York yeah I said it and I'm not no liar
They wanna see me run into Suge when shots get fired (BANG!)
Let me tell ya a lil' bit about how I growed up
Waitin for daddy to come home knowin he ain't 'gon show up (Where he at?!)
Mama said she got us don't worry we be ok
I believed it and two years later she passed away (Awww!)
Beefin with God in my head like we 'gon see what's up
I'm shootin at the sky thinkin I can hit Jesus up (BANG!)
God damn Uncle Murda shootin at Jesus now
He on that project roof squeezin off that pound
She like that white porsche I'm in with red interior nigga (VROOM!!!)
Your wifey out of pocket winkin at me curious nigga (Ah ha!)
I'm the Brooklyn Richie Porter if you ain't know
Kill a nigga that's close to me if he try to play Alpo
No trust hammers bust that's the end of that shit
Half a brick to a whole one now I got ten of them shit
Put the order in, whatever you need I can get it
I got the plug I wanna shoutout my dominican niggas (TATO!)
I remember when, a nigga got beat uptown
They showed me seed rock know I went through to rebound?
Too many robberies got niggas faced down to the ground
Too many lame New York rap niggas claimin the crown
They not no Biggie, not no Jay, not Nas (NAH!)
I'm the closest thing you got to them guys, open your eyes

[Chorus: Troy Ave]
This that, Brooklyn shit, this is not the norm
This that, safety off, with the engine on
This that, Brooklyn shit, this is not the norm
This that, safety off, with the engine on
This that, Brooklyn shit, this is not the norm
This that, safety off, with the engine on
Mercedes Benz gold watch sittin above the arm
How he got money when, he ain't have a job in so long

[Outro: Uncle Murda]
