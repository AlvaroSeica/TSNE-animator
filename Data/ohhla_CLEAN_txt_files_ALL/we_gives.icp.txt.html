I think it's the heart's desire for every person in America and Canada
to succeed (worldwide) Success is one thing that's the motivating force
behind many men (Amen) And tonight, I want to speak in a way that you'll
realize That God ordained every one of his creations to be successful.

Look at this millionare, suave, definitely paid
Lemonade, stock market played, marinate in shade, top grade
Bitches blowin' up phones, I walk by, never lie, I'm the type of guy
with sparkles in my eye
Roll in my BMW, never take the truck with your kid
Who? what? where? Over there ruby, diamond sinclare, looky there
Everywhere I stay flossin' them things
I'm like bang bling bling blang chingy bling bang
What the fuck bitch? Hurry up and suck
move along, c'mon, until it's gone
Get the fuck out the room, I'm rollin' chrome
700 spoke, whicky whicky what
Keep your hungry mouth shut, cause I'm livin' it up!

Hey, we gives no fuck!
Million dollar house, we gives no fuck!
Lavish cars, we gives no fuck!
Bling bling blang blang bang, we gives no fuck!
Hey, we gives no fuck!
7 figure bank, we gives no fuck!
Phat paid, we gives no fuck!
Whooooo, we gives no fuck!

7 figure bank, what you thank?
Bitch you tickle me pank, you lookin' rank
Coulda stank, still I spank spank whore is dank
Cause I'm livin' like a video, fuckin' every shitty hoe you know
Call me jigga-liggy-lo, fuck a juggalo that's scrub
Billion dollar drop, non-stop, from my pop, never need to cop a mop
What you got? Get the fuck off my block
I call the cop, with your fuckin' hippy hop, whooee whooee chop chop,
Tryn'a marry me, rich until they bury me, stop it cause you're scarin'
me with all that jive
Clap clap, take you back to where your wack crack neighborhood at
Cause looky jack, where we at we havin' none of that!

Hey, we gives no fuck!
Million dollar house, we gives no fuck!
Lavish cars, we gives no fuck!
Bling bling blang blang bang, we gives no fuck!
Hey want you to love me, want you to need me, want you to use me
Hey, we gives no fuck!
7 figure bank, we gives no fuck!
Phat paid, we gives no fuck!
Whooooo, we gives no fuck!

Pow, let me show you how
Took away your milly now, cash cow, cheddar wow
Dig it y'all, wicky wild wild, wait a minute y'all
I might've over-did it y'all
Forget it, I'll admit it, can't get it, cuz I'm greedy greedy greedy
Fuck the needy, fuck the treaty, line'em up and pow pow
