[Joe Mafia]
I came in the door, I said it before
Mi cheri amore, never thought her as a whore
Calling late nights, while I'm out on the tour
I was home sick, thinking you was the cure
When we dropped Thug War, and my man got locked up
Mya' on the run, and my shorty got knocked up
Turning down invites to getting my cock sucked
Dro, Henny, more LA chicks in a hot tub
I was caught up, it was lust and not love
In spite of that, I just thought it was bout us
Knowing that you can't change a hoe to a housewife
Had to rock your jaw nice, more than I rock mics
Said to say that I played her like that
She was a good girl, then I made her like that
Can't get her mind right, ain't never going back
Cuz, we was never bigger than that

[Chorus: Joe Mafia (female)]
It go lust (hey)
Or have your loss, and caught up (hey)
Girl I wanna, not fuss (hey, hey)
So stop trying to front baby, cuz it was never bout us (hey, hey)
It go lust.... (oh, daddy) lust... (oh, daddy)
Lust... (oh, daddy) lust... (oh, daddy)

[Joe Mafia]
Took a long time to get you out of my mind
I used to meditate with headaches and get mine
Make my blood boil on how much you lied
How much was going on right in front of my eyes
See you on the scene, with your pretty brown round
Tricking while I'm out of town, fronting with a smile
When I come home, you know how it's going down, then
Soon as I bounce, you laying up with a clown
Time's lifted, was it from a kiss? I will go off
But I will let it go to quit on, the big show off
Sexy little thing, couldn't wait to take your clothes off
All I was goin through thist lust, was so strong
And after I tear out your back, it's resolved than
That's the only time we ever get along, but
We was cool with that though
Cuz we was never bigger than that

[Chorus]

[Joe Mafia]
It ain't like that, I ain't the right cat
Me and you will never be up on the right track
If I gave my hand to you, I want it right back
Tear drops drowning your pillow, we bitter, you was my shorty like that
And I was dedicated, stupid, lying bout a shocked gas on cupid
Many moves, you been chasing hooligans
I was trying to keep it fam strictly, breaking my home
While I was pulling OT, on microphones
I never ever had a jones like this, about another chick
Stay missing in action, flipping on other tricks
This is a lesson learned, hard to earn
I got burned being truly concerned, foolish

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
