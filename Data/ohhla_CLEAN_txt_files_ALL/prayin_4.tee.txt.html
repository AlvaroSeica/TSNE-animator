[T.I. praying over distinct chatter]
Our father, who art in heaven
Hallowed be thy name
Thy kingdom come
Thy will be done
On earth, as it is in heaven
Give us this day, our daily bread
And forgive us for our trespasses
As we forgive those who trespassed aganist us
And lead us not into temptation
But deliver us from evil
For thine is the kingdom
And the power, and the glory
For ever and ever, hmm, amen

[Verse 1]
Man, I'm prayin' for help
While I'm lookin' at the life I left, it's kinda hard not to hate myself
But quiet as kept, right or wrong it's just the way I felt
I might be better off prayin' for death, on my knees I nealt
Still tryin' to find a way to accept, it ain't a way that I can
Help nobody, 'til I save myself, techinically I'm still a slave myself
I gotta climb out the grave myself, man I played myself
But when I look at all the fans I touched
I ask how can a man that's done so much, be treated so unjust
Cause I'm tryin' to inspire the folks, you wanna be them
Cause they sell dope, well man show 'em the ropes
Be a father or a football coach, a role model or a symbol of hope
Take another approach, instead of testifyin' aganist them in court
Handcuffin' 'em and closin' the door, so they can be worse than before
Can't you see they only do what they know
Than you wonder why they don't care no mo', life ain't fair I know
But why I'm hated everywhere I go, next time you wanna
Compare my flow, just know that I'm prayin' for help

[Chorus]
Askin' somebody else to give me a hand
I'm tryin' hard, but I'm only a man
Man, I'm prayin' for help
Hopin' somebody could see what I see
It's like the hood only matter to me
They got me prayin' for help
Hopin' somebody else can carry the torch
I'm all alone, with no kinda support
While I was prayin' for help
Realized that I don't need nobody else
If God wit' me I can do it myself
I'm tired of just prayin' for help

[Verse 2]
I know it's only one king, one thing, one being
Only somethin' I believe without seeing, and with all my faith
I pray some how, some way, regardless of what anyone say
I believe one day, that I'ma change my life, get right
Start livin' like Christ, 'til the end of my fight
I'ma be defending my strife
'Til somebody come and shut off my lights, I ain't never gon' quit
No matter how difficult it's gon' get, and you can bet whatever on this
I'm forever gon' spit, harder than niggaz hatin' on Tip
You can take away place it on Tip, If I double my load
Carry it as the trouble unfolds, holds yours
And I betta don't ?, put that on my soul
If it takes until I'ma hundred years old, bet I'm reachin' everyone of my goals

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Ay it's so many times, I done wish I could change my mind
Change my life and leave the game behind
And it's been so many days, I done prayed I could find a way
Find a heart and the time to say, only so many are blessed
With so many chances, and so many checks, so many fans
With so many arrest, and it's been so many deaths
So many prisons with niggaz in there
And the system keep playin' them to the left, man it's so many tests
So many haters love seeing you stess, but tribulations come with being the best
Still it's so many reflects, singin' by text, when they bringin' the????
Sellin' dreams never seem to jex, that's why I'm seeing some threats
So many stripes off the streets I'ma vet, so many rappers get so little respect
Now niggaz faith on the shelf, 'cause of the cards that a nigga was dealt
Or the heart that a nigga then dealt, so many niggaz done left outta the hood
Made a way for themself, instead of givin' back, they stay for they self
So many playin' they self, instead of readin', educating they self
The ones who won't even pray for they self, they got me prayin' for help

[Chorus]</pre>
