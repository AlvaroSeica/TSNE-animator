[Keri Hilson]
I just wanna live tonight
I just wanna live tonight away
I just wanna live tonight
I just wanna live my li-i-ife, ay...
I, I, I, I, I-I-I-I

[Chorus: Keri Hilson]
I just wanna live tonight
I just wanna live tonight away
I just wanna live tonight
I just wanna live my li-i-ife, ay
(New York! L.A.! Chicago! V-A! St. Louis!)
I just wanna live my life, ay
(Hey Vegas! Miami! Hey London! Toronto! Hey Paris!)
I just wanna live my li-i-ife, ay

[Nelly]
I said, I said, I said...
Top down as I roll down the back street
Shotgun with a twin in the back seat
No one, them two and it's just me
Pull up to the club like a pimp see
Shouts out to the players in the V.I.P.
Hey DJ, yeah you remember me
It's the nigga with the same crew from last week
And we be, and we be
Poppin bottles, makin noise
On the tables, on the bar
Shootin game at every broad
Tell them girls to freak them boys
I feel the Patrn ring shots
I'm throwin hundred dollar raindrops
I live it up yo, and they not
And they not - cause todayyyy

[Chorus]

[Nelly]
I'm with whatever shorty
What you thinkin?
I'm treatin all night
so what you drinkin?
Don't be afraid lil' mama, let loose
Get shorty there another Grey Goose
Tell your friends come here, let's see what they do
What they do, hey
Go shorty, it's your birthday
Want a Maybach for my birthday
Want the place to see my birthday
Want it black-on-black to the light gray
And you can roll with me
Yeah you can roll with me
All y'all can roll with me
Cause todayyyy...
Wanna live it!

[Chorus]

[Nelly + Keri Hilson]
I just wanna live to-night awayyyyy
I just wanna live to-night away-yay-yay-yay-yeah

[Nelly - repeat 2X]
If you like how this sound then shorty let's get down
You wanna go crazy y'all then let's go now
Tonight we gon' party 'til they shut the club down
I'm goin hard until they kick my ass out, out

[Chorus]

[Keri Hilson - over Chorus]
Just wanna live tonight
Just wanna live tonight away
Just wanna live my life, HEY!
I just wanna live my life, yeah
Live my life, hey

[Nelly + Keri Hilson]
Live to-night awayyyyy
(I just wanna live my life, ay)
Said I just wanna live to-night away-yay-yay-yay-yeah, yeah
(I just wanna life my li-i-ife, ay)</pre>
