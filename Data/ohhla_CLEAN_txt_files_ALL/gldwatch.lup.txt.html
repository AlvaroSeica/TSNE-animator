[Female]
Oh give the drummer some yea, yea x4

[Lupe]
Lets peruse the essentials of Cool
a brief study of/on the things so instrumental to Lu
That make me feel flyer than lobby's of W's
a disclaimer just a rhymer no credentials from a school  x2

[Verse 1]
In my Fall of Rome jeans, my Head Porter wallet
my Neighborhood shirt and my Eddie Cheng clock
Shit might not go to college but my street smart polished
like the black fingernails of that punk rock logic
Do the knowledge, man you can't be punk from projects
firm disbeliever in your punch clock promise
Was trading off my comics I was taking them to school
one of Jay-z boys now I'm skating in your pool
not to be rude I'm just hating on your rules
Like a young 50 I'm on my world tour
Good morning Singapore I'm bringing the sun wit me
from the Robert Taylor homes to Africa's slum cities
I am American mentally with Japanese tendencies
Parisian sensibility so stay out the vicinity of
yea, yea them niggas over there its just
yea, yea now look at what I wear

[CHORUS 1]
Got my, gold watch and my, gold chain
with my fancy car and my diamond ring
with my fancy broad and she foreign
so its no words and its no slang
and I'm no trick and I'm no lame
 its just so slick that she's so game, and its
yea, yea she love it over here
Its just yea, yea she love it over here x3

[Verse 2]
I like City candles and, Maharishi sandals and
Dita sunglasses, Purple Murder surface samples
I like False T-shirts Dover street is off the handle
such a good designer Junya Watanabe got damn you
 I like Yohji Yamamoto and a Mackro Solo
leather Gucci belts and Guilty Brotherhood polo's
I like Montblanch pens and Moleskine paper
I like Goyard bags and green Now-or-laters
Monocle magazine and Japanese manga
Futura, noz furatus and HTM trainers
 I love street fighter 2 I just really hate Zangeif
Only Ken and Ryu I find it hard to beat Blanka
Keep a Wii ninja hanging and an Unkle album banging
if you negative in energy then stay out the vicinity of
yea, yea them niggas over there its just
yea, yea now look at what I wear

[CHORUS 2]
Got my, gold watch and my, gold chain
with my fancy car and my diamond ring
with my, ghetto broad and she
so plain got couple scars and one of those long names
she a fight a nigga and cusses with no shame
and her Ex-man had her bagging up Cocaine but she
yea, yea she love it over here
Its just yea, yea she love it over here x3

[Verse 3]
But my most coveted thing is a high self-esteem
and a low tolerance for them telling me how to lean
See the most important parts are the ones that are unseen
the wings don't make you fly and the crown don't make you king
Now God don't like ugly aint to happy bout prettier
and ignorance is enemy so stay out the vicinity of
yea, yea them niggas over there its just
yea, yea now look at what I wear

[CHORUS 2]</pre>
