Yo, yo..

[Phonte]
There's a warring and love's on the line
Falling apart at the seams
And it's only the strong who survive
Between the joy and the screams
But right there, right here love
Such a familiar scene
Do we live, do we learn, or just die
under the weight of our dreams?

[Chorus]
I'm so lost when I'm away
Tried so long to find a place
So I say, let's just call it home
Cause that's wherever you are
Clouds in the sky, sunny days are rare
But I'd follow you almost anywhere
Right here, you can call it home

[Phonte]
There's a war but I'm still on your side
We're not on separate teams
Build a wall, tear it down, and decide
If you can say what you mean
But right there (right there), right here love
Such a familiar scene
Do we live, do we learn, or just die
under the weight of our dreams?

[Chorus 2]
I'm so lost when I'm away
Tried so long to find a place
So I say, let's just call it home
Cause that's wherever you are
Clouds in the sky, sunny days are rare
But I'd follow you almost anywhere
And right here, you can call it home
We're on our way to the stars

[Chorus 1]</pre>
