[Verse One]
I have to tell the truth
I have a weakness for women
In every state
Wherever I go
Oh boy
I know it isn't right
I feel I'm barely swimming
And the waves keep on crashing down
After every show
Oh boy
And what am I to do now
Where the hell is my crew now
Supposed to be watching my back
But they're jibbing too
And here she stands before me
And I'm trying to ignore thee
Possible chance of doing wrong
And now I sing my song

[Chorus]
What is love
And am I in it?
See I really like this girl
And I, and I think I should
But what i feel
Is there something in it?
Cause if not I'm wasting her time
And that's just not good

[Verse Two]
I'm in the mall in Altadena (okay)
Looking through a new magazine-a (okay)
Takin' a little love test to see
If I'm even there
And now it's looking like I'm failing
And now I'm slowly inhaling
Is this issue of sassy for real
If so the next step's ill
And dude I'm way past confused now
What do I have to do now?
Break up with the girl of my dreams
In the past made mistakes and
Regret every step so I say

[Chorus]
What is love
And am I in it?
See I really like this girl
And I, and I think I should
But what i feel
Is there something in it?
Cause if not I'm wasting her time
And that's just not good

[Bridge]
And if I don't know what to say
And I'm just standing there in a daze
Please don't walk away so soon
My lady, this, it might just bloom
And if i don't know what to say
And I'm still standing there in a daze
Please don't walk away from me
Cause I am trapped now set me free

[Verse Three]
I have to tell the truth
Right now I have a girlfriend (uh oh)
And she'll probably break up with me (oh oh)
After hearing this song (it's like that)
But what am I to do (I don't know)
I gotta share what I'm feeling (share it boy)
Cause if I can't tell the truth (tell the truth)
Then there's something wrong
So I still ask

[Chorus]
What is love
And am I in it?
See I really like this girl
And I, and I think I should
But what i feel
Is there something in it?
Cause if not I'm wasting her time
And that's just not good

So I have to ask
So I have to ask
So I have to ask
C'mon on y'all
All my people
All my people c'mon
Da da dada
Da da dadaadaa 
Da da dada

Da da dadaadaa 
I like you, I hate you
I want you, I love you
I like you, I hate you
I want you, I love you</pre>
