[Chorus: Isaiah Rashad + SZA]
Now can we fall in love while "Southernplayalistic" 
bangin' through the night  (fall in love, through the night)
And I ain't ever felt no type of way 
about this livin' do or die (type of way, do or die)
And when they see our age they say we're young
I'll let you push me to the side (push me, to the side)
At least, we fell in love with somethin' greater 
than debatin' suicide (at least, we fell in love)

[Isaiah Rashad]
How you feelin' babyyyyyyy?
How you feelin' babyyyyyyy?

[Isaiah Rashad + SZA]
I travel... for you
I battle... for you
Cause I love, to call, your name
I travel... for you

Now can we fall in love while "Southernplayalistic" bangin' through the night
And I ain't ever felt no type of way about this living do or die
And when they see our age they say we're young, I'll let you push me to the side
At least, we fell in love with something greater than debating suicide
