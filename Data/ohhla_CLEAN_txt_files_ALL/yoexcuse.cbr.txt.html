[Chris Brown]
Whoa
Doo doo doo doo doo
Yeah
Yeah

Yo
Tell me fellas have you seen her? (seen her)
It was about five minutes ago
When I seen the hottest chick that a young'n never seen before
I say yo

Tell the girls I wanna meet her (meet her)
On second thought that ain't the way to go
I gotta give a game proper
Spit it so she get it there she is I gotta stop her
Or should I talk about her smile? (it's been said before)
Or what about her style? (too obvious)
I'm outta time she's out the door
I gotta go for mine
I think I'll say yo

1-    I don't know your name but excuse me miss
I saw you from across the room
And I got to admit that you got my attention
You're making me wanna to say yo

I know you're trying to leave but excuse me miss
I saved the last dance for you
How I'd love to keep you here with me, oh baby

[Busta Rhymes]
Busta-Bus baby
Ehyo Chris Brown, let me +Big Bang+ on them
Check it

While I'm sittin' and analyzin' how to get witcha
Peepin' your actions and seein' how your body is so official
So immaculate complexion has got me open
You walk by and smell the mango on your body butter lotion
I lay you up in the cut while I survey your face to your butt
Appreciatin' your swag and runway strut
You make a fella wanna chill with you all day
Til it's night and embellish in the four-play
And makin' me wanna say

Repeat 1

Repeat 1

[Chris Brown]
I want to be where you are
Ain't nothing wrong with dancing
Baby you're so romantic
Baby, I can be in your heart
So many things I want to tell you
I think that I should start by saying yo

Repeat 1

Now everbody just clap your hands like this (like this)
Just clap your hands like this (whoa like this)
And if your shorty's in the house tonight
Just grab her by the hand, homie make her understand
Y'all was made to dance like this (like this)
Y'all was made to bounce like this (whoa like this)
Just let her know she was made for you
And you want to do everything she want to, man

Ha!
Whoo!</pre>
