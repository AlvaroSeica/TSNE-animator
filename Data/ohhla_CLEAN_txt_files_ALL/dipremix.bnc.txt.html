[DO OR DIE]
Smooth baby
Steady dippin'
And for all the B-K's in 93
But you don't hear me though
Straight everyday bangin'
Slangin' you know what I mean?
Uh, the evil-ass C-Side
Steady dippin'

[DO OR DIE]
Back into my neighborhood, stop at daytime
Get a bag of chips and a dollar whine
Roll down Greenleaf, make a left on Caress
Fire up the endo, can't be smokin' on the stress
Hangin' out with Crip figures (fire up the bud Cuz!)
Ready to smoke them Snoops so my finger's on the trigger
Always ready for some set trippin'
That's why I'm dippin' and dappin', crippin' and dippin' never catch me slippin'
All the women ??? (what's up?)
Raise up the phone
And floss with the switch
Front back
And pause on threes
Rag Top Four
Sittin' on them D's
Checkin' ass for the big booty one (damn, she got ??)
Mackin to the skunk and let her ride shotgun
Roll by the park where I case up for hoes
For them straight-up Crips and ??? G roll (what's up Cuz?!)
To stop them gangstas from hangin' like nuts
Even when One-Time pulls up
One-Time'll get checked like a trick
White boys in his gangstas' click
Move on before you can't pass
And ?Awol 3rd? will come back to hurt your ass
You ain't gon' change this gangsta Crip thang
The plan is simple cause thangs don't change
When you're gone (Shit ain't changed Cuz!)
We still be crippin'
And makin' cash money
Steady dippin'

[C-NOTE]
Even Boyz N Tha Hood went do or die
Them Crips is rollin' deep and I'm slidin'
Bustin' to just drivin' them ??
That's why I got to beat a Snoop, I gots to have my 9
My ?? in my Rag Top Coupe
In my Caddy hittin' corners, hit the switches
Droppin' quick move fakers on my tip
Like some tricks
6-0 Rollin deep smokin' them Slob 20's Crenshaw Mafia
I kill them good and plenty
C-Note is one down G-Crip
I got my grip tap down in my cleavage
And if a Snoop wanna jack I got my steel deep yet
Strapped down where the tiger ?? at
Gimme another ?? cause I gots him in the prove
Take him to a motel and pull my Long Beach jack move
Me become a Slob? Aw, never!
C-Note: a Rollin' 20 Crip forever

[SIN]
Much Crip love
On a blue day like this
Packin' a .44
Roll in a Crip 6'
They call me Sin Loc
Yes the G that ain't no joke
The mystery of mess
With a killa Snoop rat flow
See a Slob's brain dread while I'm dippin'
And I'ma hit the fool up
With two C's cause I'm steady crippin'
Sin Loc a mastermind of respect
So you don't get it twisted
Cause if you do Stretch you get stretched
Sayin' to keeps no bustas outta gangbang fool
Much Crip love and we can't stand die-'Rus
Now if it's twisted then I twisted for your kid say
See cause I'm roll about mine that means I don't fake
So put your dead rag back into your pocket fool
Only thang you swingin' on us nuts when I drop you
Ain't noboby leaving like no dead rag busta
And when I'm steady dippin'
Respect is from the shoulders
Cause Sin Loc'll peel any Snoop
At his own will
But I stop for black folks to try to take a chill pill
And ?quick? gonna gets to grain on each other
Cause worst than dead I can't stand to see a dead brother
So I ain't trippin' on no bustas if I catch him slippin'
I just don't give mines up and just keep steady dippin'

[BLUE RAG]
I'm dippin' on the East Side of the Compton Hub
For the neighborhood Crip gang Cuz I got much love
I'm givin' it up
To the rest of the Crip gangs
Steady crippin' and puttin' in work on them Slobs main
KELLY PARK, ATLANTIC DRIVE and SOUTH SIDE
SPOOK TOWNS always down to hoo-ride
FARM DOG, NUTTY BLOCC and TRAGNIEW
It's killin' up them Snoops like Vietnam goose
LANTANA BLOCC, the SWAMPS and ORIGINAL FRONT
Be hoo-ridin' on Slobs all through the month
DUCKY HOOD, PALMER BLOCC and ORIGINAL POCKET
Be pluggin' on off brands like a plug socket
PARK VILLAGE, SANTANA and MONA PARK
The ?come-up? is up to way
Puttin' a slug in a Snoop's heart
And by the way: Crippin' don't stop!
Cause them FRONT STREET CRIPS in WATTS gots much props
JORDAN DOWNS, FUSHED TOWN and P.J's
Two 1-11 N-HOOD is steady crippin' on them Avenues
MAIN STREET, EAST COASTS and ROLLIN 60 N-HOOD
Is always crippin' and nuthin' on damn good
Two C's up to L-B-C
SCHOOL YARD SHOTGUN and A-G-C
Shot outs to them 9-7 KITCHENS
And Original Crip sets

Much Crip love, Blue Rag's outta here and I'm steady dippin'</pre>
