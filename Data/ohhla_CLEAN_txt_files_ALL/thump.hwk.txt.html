[G.L.O]
Nah fuck that, I don't believe it if man made it
Get smacked hard, Backyard brawl and fan favorite
Stand straight if you aren't the one to get singled out
Sting your mouth from the ??? faggots that sing and shout
Bring about dark shadow and travel round the battle ground
Giving sentences like a Judge throwing the gavel down
Chop blocks and scientist, Dominant Dr. Iron Fist
Drop the livest shit and die for this hip hop environment
From seven thirty I'm dirty, I'm Jersey born and breed
I've been warning heads from the door that youÂ’re getting torn to shreds
I'ma Earth you, Hurtful, Beat rappers purple
Words being spread with seven Heavenly virtues

[Hook: Tommy Whispers]
Thump-Thump-Thump, That Thump-Thump-Thump-Thump
That Thump-Thump-Thump-Thump, That Thump-Thump-Thump-Thump

[Tommy Whispers]
Cock back and shoot don't give a fuck who it hit
Polluted with the Staten Isle-Dirty Jerz shit
Perfect murder, I would say he deserved this
Loose links sink ships so he's getting murked quick
Get popped in your head here's twenty percent
American Gangster for these dead Presidents
My Army of one will run through your regiment
Night gloves in my hand leave no finger prints
Blood on the concrete, Blood on the floor
Blood in the staircase, Blood in the halls
Get Clorox out water and wipe it all off
No evidence, Perfume to through the dogs off
Sawed off, Pump-Pump, Tare your head off
That Thump-Thump, Unspoke tell em off
Loud Mouf, T.M.F., It's headed into stores
Get the clout, Re-event it and better then before

[Hook]

[Kryme Life]
Uhh, I'm on my shit man hate it or love of
No time to mess with bullshit I'm banging and thumping
Most these niggas is followers swearing they tugging
Easy does it, You realize you wasn't when them slugs hit
Stapleton at the strip you wanna polly on
Fuck around and get touched like Omarion
I'll send them at you, What are your chances
Of living, Man you spun around and Little Joe dancing
I'll come around where you be out standing and chilling
All of a sudden niggas peel out cannons, Spill em
Throwing bullets like Eli Manning, Hitting
My receivers best believe they landing
You don't give a fuck I don't give a fuck either
I'm eager, To bust a hole in you like a speaker
Catch a nigga on parole blow him out his sneakers
Crazy criminals coming from a whole legion
