Hip hopperz and chart topperz, that be us
No more laughin' at us, no more back of the bus
Gettin' hed in the wip, high on crack and the dust

Yo dat brooklyn bullshit, we on it again
Come on

Pop number ones, and pop from my guns
Stacks for my daughters, and nots for my sons

Stay wit b-boy, i fly wit birds that are brainless
And one hit record, son i'm about to be famous
