[Intro]
We Just Tryna Be
Like The Niggaz That Came Before Us You Know
Hear Us Out

Mr. Underdog
They Don't Hear My Bark
Want The Title But I'm Always Fighting Under Card
Mr. Underrated, Tryna Make It, Yeah I'm Tryna Tell 'Em
I Ain't Tryna Be No

[Verse 1]
And I Be Feeling Like Hova When Y'all Was Sleeping On Him
So Called Music Enthusiasts Ain't Even Know It
I Ain't Being Facetious Saying I Speak For The Culture
I Just See Through To My Roots Like I'm Greasing With Sulfur
Without No Reasonable Doubt Y'all Was All On The Sofa
By 2004, Jerseys Was Out Your Wardrobe
When I Read What I Wrote Feel Like I Reached Out A Holster
I'm Just Aiming What I'm Saying Hope You Bleed Out Emotion
I Ain't Saying I Don't Fuck With All These Other Niggaz
I'm Just Saying I'm Above All These Other Niggaz
Fake Hugs From All These Fuck Niggaz
No Love For All These Sucka Niggaz
Feeling Like Sean Carter Before The Diamond
You Know That Sort Of Rhyming Was Sort Of Head Of It's Timing
I Got That Same Hunger, Rock Ya For The Chain Hunger
That Going Through Some Things
Cause They Don't Hear The Shit I'm Saying Hunger

[Chorus]
Mr.Underdog
They Don't Hear The Bark
I Want That Title But They Got Me Fighting Under Card
Nigga Just Underrated, Hustling Just Tryna Make It
Fuck What Them Niggaz Saying I Inspire For Greatness
Mr. Underdog And This Is Not A Bark
Under Ya Nose A Rose Grew With No Sun At All
I Ain't Stunting Y'all
Tell Them Niggaz They Sleeping
Tell Them Niggaz They Slipping
Tell Them Niggaz That We Up

[Verse 2]
Felling Like Rozay Before Jay
The Marathon Of This Game Always Changes In Pace
Now They Mention My Nigga With All The Greats
And Guess Who My Nigga Tell 'Em Is On The Way
You In Debt To The Game Success Is Expected
Fucking With Ricky Got Me Working Relentless In Sessions
Work Ethic Respected By By Several Record Executives
Well Dressed I'm Not The Type That Gets Reckless With Necklace
Underrated Overdressed Well Paid No Vistech
I'm A Top 10 Her Nigga Looking For Respect
There Was A Time When They Hated All The Southern Rappers
Now All Them Rappers Looking For Southern To Rap On
I Be Liking This Mula, It's Gone Talk If You Have It
By The Looks Of Your Balance You Acting Like Charlie Chaplan
Passion In Rapping A Blessing To Even See This
Some Of My Equals Didn't See Past Their Rookie Season

[Chorus]
Mr.Underdog
They Don't Hear The Bark
I Want That Title But They Got Me Fighting Under Card
Nigga Just Underrated, Hustling Just Tryna Make It
Fuck What Them Niggaz Saying I Inspire For Greatness
Mr. Underdog And This Is Not A Bark
Under Ya Nose A Rose Grew With No Sun At All
I Ain't Stunting Y'all
Tell Them Niggaz They Sleeping
Tell Them Niggaz They Slipping
Tell Them Niggaz That We Up, We Up

I Ain't Saying I Don't Fuck With All These Other Niggaz
I'm Just Saying I'm Above All These Other Niggaz
Fake Hugs From All Them Fuck Niggaz
No Love For Them Sucka Niggaz

I Ain't Saying I'm Above All These Other Niggaz
I'm Just Saying I Don't Fuck With All These Other Niggaz
Fake Hugs From All Them Fuck Niggaz
No Love For All Them Sucka Niggaz

Mr.Underdog
They Don't Hear The Bark
I Want That Title But They Got Me Fighting Under Card
Nigga Just Underrated, Hustling Just Tryna Make It
Fuck What Them Niggaz Saying I Inspire For Greatness
Mr. Underdog And This Is Not A Bark
Under Ya Nose A Rose Grew With No Sun At All
I Ain't Stunting Y'all
Tell Them Niggaz They Sleeping
Tell Them Niggaz They Slipping
Tell Them Niggaz That We Up, We Up</pre>
