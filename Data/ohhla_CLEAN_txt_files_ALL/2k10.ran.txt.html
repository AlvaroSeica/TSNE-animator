Uhh, 2k10
The future is now, a new day begins
What looked so bright is now dim and grim
This is my story, and my name is Ken
You might remember me from my past life
King of the Street Fight, but it all changed last night
I'd been retired for a couple of years
And then I switched gears, tried another career
I was a lab tech, this employment brought enjoyment
I wanted to improve live instead of destroy it
My partner Troy went ahead with our plan
to create better life for man
And with our invention, any climate man could withstand
Even increase strength in the legs and the hands
With a small dose you'd see huge results
And with a big dose you could lose your pulse
The plan was there, but we never got to try it
See our formula got jacked by space pirates
I walked in the door a quarter after four
to see the formula gone, and Troy on the floor
My first thoughts was to head for the exit
Cause the solution hadn't been fully tested
Troy said "Hey yo! You gotta catch 'em"
So began the hunt for the Cyboplasm...

("Round two - FIGHT!")

They stole from me, and they killed my homey
It's stuff like that that'll turn me back to the old me
I had to fight fire with fire
Had to regain the trainin I had 'fore I retired
But I upgraded for 2010
Bionic arm and upgrades into my skin
Traveled the galaxy for what seemed like years
Traversin every planet, and every frontier
I got a new clue in every place
Luckily the Cyboplasm is easy to trace
Every where the crook went - he left a clue
I wasn't sure if that was what he intended to do
But I was hot on his heels, until I heard a strange voice
Tellin me to leave, and that I made a bad choice
The same time I felt, indescribable pain
in the same spots the bionics in my frame
But I ain't gon' stop, cause y'all know my background
Ken's never been the type to back down
Feel I'm gettin closer, the voices gettin louder
Although I'm in pain I feel increases in my power
And everywhere I went I learned a new trait
New talent, new skills that would seal their fate
So I kept movin, hopin the culprit might slip
Then on planet 29 I received a hot tip
I was close, I knew it, only thing left
was to grab the formula and avenge my man's death
I got to his planet, my energy charged up
Busted in his door he was there with his guard up
Sent some of his flunkies to keep me entertained
But one of my punches'll leave 'em burstin into flames
Faced with a web of lies and I'm tryin to cut through it
The pirate said Troy put these cats up to it
I can't believe that, but he said it's true
He said Troy's alive, and he infected you~!
I ain't wanna hear it so I kicked him in the face
And just then, Troy walked in the place
And said "I'm alive my trusted friend
The formula is mine - this is the end!"</pre>
