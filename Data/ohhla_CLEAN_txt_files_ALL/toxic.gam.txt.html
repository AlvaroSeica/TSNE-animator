[Danny Brown]
Flow so pneumonia, yo' bitch want my boner
I take her 'round the corner then I gave that hoe a bonus
Bitches wanna bone us, we ain't cubic zirconia
But I will never own 'em so to me them bitches loaners/loners
On the deck, and the tongue flip like the "my" in "My Sharona"
Got her drip drip, drippin like that lemon and Corona
Bankroll thick, like that neck on Sabonis
But I will never trick, you just get dick and bologna
Take that tenderoni, and now she ride my pony
And cheese came with it like a snatch of pepperonis
I'm an O.G., I'm with C.G.
You a he-she, nigga run you back like a repeat
I'm a pill-poppin E.T., Givenchy on a ten-speed
Hot like Britney in '03, ya know me
Smokin on that +Toxic+, sippin on the Olde E
Dippin in that Molly got me higher than some Flow C

{*repeated "Flow C" is cut-n-scratched*}

[Childish Gambino]
Fandango my Mandingo, we should do a movie
Groupies lookin like the Yakuza in my jacuzzi
Excuse me I'm on that ooh-wee, my pockets are "Life With Louie"
Euros is different colors, my wallet look like a Coogi
He who speakin the least is Chief Keef-in the peace
Leavin seeds in yo' niece, prayin that she ain't late
Sprayin like that AK, now that shit my namesake
'Bino you so nasty, ass like an ashtray
Smokin Flying Lotus, used to be Jehovah's
I'm in your girl and now she feelin Polish like pierogis
They hopin that they smoke us, naw man, never that
Trippin off that earwax, Danny Brown and D-Stacks
Ill pandemic, man that shit be everywhere
Midas is your highness and you +Haribo+ like Gummi Bears
Why I'm fly like a cockpit, you don't fly like a ostrich
Stupid shit like a moshpit, can't believe this is "Toxic"

[sampled from "Toxic" by Britney Spears]
"It's in the air and it's all around
 Too high, can't come down" {*repeat 4X*}
