[Chorus]
WATCH OUT! We run the floor
Vents One in this motherfucker
Like WATCH OUT! We back for more
Sound boy better chill and let the speaker suffer
WATCH OUT! We run the floor
Trigger Trials in this motherfucker
Like WATCH OUT! WATCH OUT!
WATCH OUT! ...

[Vents]
It's like Vents on the creep, something to rock you to sleep
You seek and you shall find the mind run deep
I speak vicious, reminisce about warriors
in the Murray Rivers, God forgive us
They know not what they do
Rendezvous to make sure that the horns shake you
Take two then pass, putting out dope that last
beyond smoke that travel in the glass
Unravelling the past on a path of despair
Barking, starving to bear ... teeth
Swallowing grief, lost in the bottomless deep
Praying that tomorrow I'll breathe
Roll deep cover, each brother
connect my fam, one hand watch the other
Direct assault on your senses
This the relentless, closing mics before breakfast

[Chorus]

[Vents]
Sickened by the stench of the ringtone, the cancer in your bone
Feeling alone, we keep fearing the unknown
Fully grown, stone cold, do what the fuck you're told
Keep the city in a chokehold
Cold as ice, days of our lives
like Camp Crystal Lake after Jason arrives
Turn people into fearful creatures
Locking them refugees up and that's mere procedures
Follow leaders to darkness, roaches, apartments
Deal with piece-of-shit fathers
Single mothers, God don't love us
Government ensure the rich stay above us
Wear them rubbers, no populating
till every last senator sent back to Satan
Vents breaking 'em down
Shells from the mind of the maniac, crab emcees better ...

[Chorus]

[Vents]
The kick drum toe tagger, no fatter
Competition like Cold War, sneak with a cloak and a dagger
Energy, matter, move at a slow vibration
Lost in the forest time wasting
Throw a temper tantrum
Smacking police in the face with their own fucking handgun
Fuck you, you better WATCH OUT!
I take chumps apart and transform brains to art
Now one less gun is a plan
But I prefer one more gun in the hands of the right man
I smell a Taipan snake
Emcees is acting kind of weird like cops on the take
Making 'em shake, drum and the bass
2006 is nothing but another summer to waste
Another day another dead, another born
Another military turning the country the colour red

Now WATCH OUT!
Like WATCH OUT!
WATCH OUT!
Like WATCH OUT! Like WATCH OUT! Like WATCH OUT!
