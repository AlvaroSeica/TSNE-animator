"Come on y'all get live get down
Coming to you from the underground
So listen up to what we say
All ya sucka MC's won't you please come out today
Come on y'all get live get down
Coming froming the underground
Cool, cool cause I don't get upset
Check it out
Tanget to my comprehension is just too complex"

[Denizen Kane]
See at night I can't sleep, I toss and turn
Yearn, to fall into oblivion but pieces all to earn
Turning mental circles thats revolving and redundant
Place upon my phantom features thats rewarding and abundant
We're coming into self indulgence cleaned of the present
And losing in the struggle in a 40 ounce of guessing
Pretending that the morning won't come tearing through the curtain
Burying my mother's efigy, cursing and burning

[Qwazaar]
Yo! back in the days when I was a teenager
before the spiked bats and razor blades laced with hatred
You could locate Q-W-A rockin status with Satan
My brother used to say that I was raised in a demon's matrix
With hellish thoughts, with faceless with relevant reverant talk
Evade haters, sedated with a veteran spits for loving his rocks
Typical suicidal schizofrenic cults
I don't know who to cut
And my guns are like to needles to you cause we both shoot em up

[Qwel]
The Q-W-E who the fuck want strife
Beat you half to death twice and smack your back to life
Underground stalagtite, quick with the dick spitting a rhyme
You criminals flip lines and forget to committ crimes
Synonomous with nothing, bragging how you snag me beers
Undescribable like "dog you had to be there"
Come on and hit me quick
Spit sissy fits and shitty rhymes
Practice "I will never fuck with Qwel" lines fifty times

[Denizen Kane]
Let us begin, what? where? why? or when?
It will all be explained by the spraying of a pen
Henpecked mugs become thugs and proceed to make me vex man
Throw hissy fits on stage on call that weak shit battling
I can't ignore hardcore, cold stares and shudders
If these head cases are hard rocks I'm a be flipping boulders
Stained by the static and the clubs are on the elvevator
Fuck being smart, Denizen is aggrevated

[Qwazaar]
Well I heard you had the fever for the flavor of the other
Qwel, Qwazaar, Denizen Kane or is it like another
My blade cuts ya, ya face erupting before I touch ya
The Q-W-A-Z-double A-R motherfucker!
Enter the next world intense flame tames
Dreadlocks to s-curls
Thoughts bury your skull between your pectorals
While I'm fucking Adina sources leaves your body buried
beneath the coffins deep in the forest devoid of breathing

[Qwel]

All you wannabes, wanna be, ask yo, cats know
There goes none of my team the battle type of assholes
Is that so?
I'm glad you brought your dad
Now take an autograph back to the backpack and finish the thought you had
Catch a hi-fi to your eye might as much to mush me
Calling battle cats bitches and all your dogs pussies
Look me in the third eye, heard I killed your planet
Rhyming is the key this 12 inch is nine bills around it

[Denizen Kane] + (Qwazaar)
(You on point Den?) All the time Qwa
+Sucka Niggaz+ got me telling +A Million Stories+ help me +Find My Way+
+Marauding+ through the +Midnight+ +Phony Rappers+ need to +Get a Hold+
Because at that my mind is checking rhymes what did I get for when I stutter roll
Schools feel the pressure of suburban and together
I am walking the war towards an electric bee like scourge is never
Bugging out because I took out planters my only distraction
And everything is garbage through mind power and packaged

*You lack the minerals and vitamins, verbally sodomize lies
Spit lines to antichrist hybrids screaming That's It!
Paragraphs are grabbing every neck and slash the match win
Against a syllable master while you waste your hazardous tactics get back bitch
See, Q-W-A don't really give a fuck what you say
And I'll attack you with the skill and level of a geen beret
Then I'll appear before you as an Eloheem
Here to scorch you
The razor sharp blade I'll force you to cough up a tonsel

[Qwel]
I'm first to live in infamy inspire sympathy when you rip notes
For those who doubt it
Typical Cats is bout it like Cliff's Notes
Quotes won't need hope to see flow potency
I'm not Qwel, this is some cat not even half as dope as me
You know we show love motherfuckers cause Venus sent me
Pussies calling us assholes for penis envy
I split crews in twos to cruise the road with a fork in it
Taking whack rappers out faster than black actors in horror flicks
You're too weak like fortnights
Toward fights with battle tracks, Typical Cats
By the time you catch us we'll be whack so laugh

"Ha Ha Ha ha ha ha ha
Be the party people ha ha see you later"

[All]

Read my lips kid, the Typical Cat is sickest
