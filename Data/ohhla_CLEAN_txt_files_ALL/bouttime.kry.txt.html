[Intro: Kryme Life]
Yeah, niggas know what time it is, man
We out here, going hard, man
Believe it, yo

[Chorus: Kryme Life]
It's about time, I came up
Too long, man, I've been down
But I'm strong, I'm still around
So I'mma keep on doing my thing

[Kryme Life]
Yo, I spit it for my real niggas, let's build niggas
Do whatever it take, to get this mill, niggas
Ain't nothing stopping us now, it's how we feel
Niggas can't touch the skill, we do this at will
From Stapleton Projects, never lost a step
Came through fronting, and you would of lost your breath
Talking that nonsense'll cause you death
Understand you lose love, when you lost respect
And we get that, when I'm out of town, dunn, of course I rep
Spit that, make a nigga get back
I don't give a fuck, in the streets, in the club
Let me see them hands, get 'em up, if you hold ten or a hundred grand
Get 'em up, and the Kryme Life, we live it up
I represent them real hungry kids
Jakes want us in the can doing ugly bids
But we Bogart the streets like Humphrey did, live

[Chorus: Kryme Life]
It's about time, I came up
Too long, man, I've been down
But I'm strong, I'm still around
So I'mma keep on doing me
It's about time, we came up
Too long, man, we've been down
But we strong, we still around
So we gon' keep on doing our thing

[Tommy Whispers]
Word to my skin and bones, we rock Timbs
Big Champion hoods, but ya'll look thin
You get ya nose boxed broke, slap a toast to ya chin
And no approaching my men, cut the small talk, dump you off a boardwalk
Into an ocean full of sharks, watch for NARC's
You wearing snorkels just like the thugs
And they love to bust slugs, smoke mad dust and act bug
Rush clubs, that's how we do it in the winter
Fragile niggas all warm blooded and shiver
Cold as ice, we rolling dice, in the center
The middle of the projects, where ya'll don't enter
Yo, we in, let the eagle fly, niggas is schemin'
We get a little sleep, but we always big dreaming
December snow flakes drop, the block's freezing, it's bleeding
We still hug the building with them demons
Two twelve Broad Street, merge through 120 precent

[Chorus: Kryme Life]
It's about time, we came up
Too long, man, we've been down
But we strong, we still around
So we gon' keep on doing our thing
It's about time, I came up
Too long, man, I've been down
But I'm strong, I'm still around
So I'mma keep on doing me

[Kryme Life]
Whatever come, out in my mind, it's inside of my rhyme
Don't ever get it confused with the ridicule, I hit at you
Whichever nigga you choose, we sending the rules in
Whoever wanna break 'em, they going on vacation
Local street, straight to the bottom of cage basement
Catch ya'll niggas, gonna have to find 'em a replacement
You ain't that godfather, but he bout to get buried alive
Peace to Shyne, locked up in Clinton
Homey still bidding serving a sentence, listen
We too real for these fake ass niggas to keep winning
Jesus Walk had much of a meaning for a nigga to keep
Sinning, but as long as we keep 'em leaning
Fiends keep spinning, on a rise, gotta come up quick
Get every dollar, boy, stack them chips
Get on your holla, believe the rest'll follow
Take a look inside of my face, look at a rider

[Chorus]

[Outro: Kryme Life]
Continent to continent, nigga, we conquering
That's right, Kryme Life in effect, nigga
The big businessman</pre>
