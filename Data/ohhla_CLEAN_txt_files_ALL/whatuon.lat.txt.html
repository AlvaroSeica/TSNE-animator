(chorus) 2X
If it ain't nothing wrong
Come tell me what you on
Do I gotta sweat to show that I'm the one that'll make you moan
If you all alone
Why you ain't call me on the phone
If you like what you see then take me home so we can get it on
(you really shouldn't be that open as long as you provokin strokin)

(LaTanya)
I saw you peep me
Sitting in V.I.P.
Gave me a look that was freaky
That's when I knew you wanted to get wit me
Come on over and meet me
Don't front you know you like what you see
Here's my number so beep me
You can hit me up tomorrow around bout three
(You really shouldn't be that open as long as you provokin strokin)

(chorus)

(LaTanya)
You got me waiting
You haven't even called me yet
Either you faking
Or you just wanna make me sweat
You see what you're forgetting
That this other brother's on the set
And if you don't know what you're missing
I'm the rawest woman you've ever met
(You really shouldn't be that open as long as you provokin strokin)

(chorus)

(Twista)
Girl you better quit playing
You know your body got me lusting
What, you never seen a playa blushing
Hushing
Waiting for you to kick up a discussion
You know bumping and grinding is to be a custom
Flushing
A fresh fit
Dress slick
Sexy, that's it
I wanna holler but I'm too high
Spit the rhythm of a true lie
Do fly, I wanna see what's up but am I too shy
Why lie
But you climbing the stairs with your sexy butt
Acting like you wanna sex me up
Or got paid getting some niggas who wanna set me up
You got some nips that I love to suck
Me bein the one they call Twista
I got control see
Cause you see how these silly hoes be
I'm just trying to stay on my toes
And happy you chose me

(chorus)

( LaTanya (Twista) )
Mmm (You really shouldn't be that open as long as you provokin strokin)
Hey hey (You really shouldn't be that open as long as you provokin strokin)
Mmm (You really shouldn't be that open as long as you provokin strokin)
Uh yea yea (You really shouldn't be that open as long as you provokin strokin)
Yea yea yea (You really shouldn't be that open as long as you provokin strokin)
