(*talking*) 
7-13 the truth, ok that's right 
We stuck out here in the streets nigga 
Still searching for a piece of mind 
The hustle is all we got, I'ma grind to the end nigga 
I take this shit to the limit, everything from my heart nigga 

[Lil' Keke] 
They say I'm still, one the best there is 
Been on the hustle getting paid, for some months over years 
Ask God every night, to remove my fears 
I done lost a whole lot, but had to lose them tears to switch gears 
A lot of niggaz, follow my lead 
My team strong fuck failing cause we must succeed, a rare breed 
Crazy, when I smoke that weed 
I guess these constant bad habits put my mind at ease, I gotta breathe 
The streets, get a lot of my time 
Got me praying real hard, for a piece of my mind 
Yeah I'm still pressing forward, fuck lagging behind 
Bout my bidness everyday, while these niggaz is crying and I ain't lying 
Mash cause I must get mine 
When your days get dark, you know it's tougher to shine 
Slow it down get your head right, then unwind 
Never gave up I stayed on the grind my nigga, it's my time 

[Chorus] 
I'm still one of the best of my kind 
Out here working, and I'm searching for a piece of my mind 
Lord knows, I'm out here hustling for the rest of my time 
Crawling back, and still looking for the front of the line I'm on the grind 
Hey this shit a grind (grind), this shit a grind (grind) 
This shit a grind, I can't stand wasting time 
So I'm getting mine (mine), I'm getting mine (mine) 
I'm getting mine, putting it all on the line 

[Propain] 
Yeah, was bred to get it in the hardest times 
Two options where I'm from, you either starve or grind 
Southside nigga, we was taught to shine 
Mind of a G bitch, hustling this heart of mine 
I'm dying, what you gon' do when that court decline 
And your gal bitching in your ear, because your daughter crying 
Grind, mayn a helping hand is hard to find 
You gotta hit these streets become a beast, morphing time 
Diamonds round my neck, same thang around my wrist 
Just a year ago, these niggaz claimed I wouldn't amount to shit 
Now me and my niggaz hopping off of planes, counting chips 
I went from getting hate, to treated like a king around this bitch 
I got my foot on they neck, and I won't let go 
And still pimping pens, till I'm platinum in the ghetto 
Yeah, I ain't stunting I ain't capping 
I'm just motivating these real niggaz, showing em it can happen I'm grinding 

[Chorus] 

[Mug] 
I swear I'm on a grind, on that all night shit 
Anything gotta be better, than them all white bricks 
Feds lurking through the neighborhood, gotta watch how I talk on the phone 
So much going through my mind, can't express it on one song 
I'm in the field as we speak, on my gorilla shit 
Seen myself on TV, I couldn't picture this 
Do it for the smell of success, that's fresh air 
You thinking bout tomorrow, I'm stacking for next year 
Kids need food, daddy stay on a mission 
So fuck getting a plate, I'm building my own kitchen 
Hungry all about my scratch, palms itching 
Haters sick thinking I won't explode, this bomb's ticking 

[Chorus]</pre>
