[Cise Star]
Sometimes I let the stress get the best of me
Empty liquor bottles litter the floor, before was my enemy
Familiar with the taste in my mouth
Mickey? eyes from last night, God damn what the fuck is about
But don't play me, cause I need a way out
Only human in my skin, well shit I can't lie to myself again, feel me
No monkey on my back grin wit his mouth
Heaven opened up it's doors and I feel through a cloud
A fallen angel, crip to L.A.E. to make an angle
My mind ain't right, because my mind ain't stable, get it?
I stand and I fall, and get up cause I'm ready to run
Like Icarus because I'm close to the sun

We goin down to the river, downhill we all float
Pennywise in the gutter I'm stealin the boat
Let it go to the rhythm my vision is so ghost
Vision is so ghost, my vision is so ghost
(Repeat)

[Akin]
Though I see peace scars with abundant danger
Thugs got guns in the air there's anger
Derek caught one in the chest he shot back
Now his friend is yellin for Ja to bring him back
Lost hopes, boy floats wonderin why
Why he couldn't feel real beneath the surface of lies
The night is young but we get old
So full with them deep see tide rise
Boy cries, he in flock with illusion at night
He saw the sky the land, words boom &amp; life's boring
Where crack vials move the black child cause life's torment
Where vanity be so real that life's dormant
The cats quick to make beef like a George Forman
Man fuck that, he searchin for faith
From afros to cornrows the style of the day
But now as of late, you can tell anyway
Man, he don't stress the hair let it curl and shape
And then grow parallel to a spiritual mate
He found Ja, sprung by the bendy drunks sound got him high
Read wit again that slang to get by
Dread-locked in the guy chef servin up pies
Eat, if you dare fiends walk with a stare
Magnetic, to the rock, that's why Larry is here
Place unknown though stray bullets call home
Where truce is far from truth is war zones
Like put ya guns in the air and shoot'em up
21 gun salute lose ya last and bust
Larry is the victim crossfire life of bruh man
I need to go seekin salvation is what I thought
But then I saw peace scars with abundant danger
Thugs had guns in the air there's anger
This nigga caught one in the chest he shot back
Now some dread is yellin for Ja to bring him back

[Chorus - Cise Star]
We goin down to the river, downhill we all float
Pennywise in the gutter I'm stealin the boat
Let it go to the rhythm my vision is so ghost
Vision is so ghost, my vision is so ghost
