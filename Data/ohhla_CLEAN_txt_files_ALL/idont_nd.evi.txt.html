[Intro: Evidence]
D-O-N-T, N-E-E-D, L-O-V-E (E-V!)
It's EV, yeah, back on my shit
c'mon..

{sample from Boogie Down Productions's "Love's Gonna Getcha}
 "You know, that's why, man..
 I be tellin you all the time, man y'know..
 LOVE, that word 'love' is a very serious thing
 And if you DON'T watch out...I'll tell you that.."

[Evidence]
Michael Connelly reminded me with Echo Park
of days of hoppin on the metro, when they let those spark
Back when I collected retro art, and since then 
many are dearly departed, God bless they heart
God bless they hearts, harder living in pain
Where the sun and the rain became one in the same
I took it as a lesson I was still learnin
I'm still with the will of the '84 torch burnin
I been through heartbreaks to break-ups to make-ups to broke again
Not +Back Again+, my soul on the rope again
Took the jacket off and saw blood on my sleeves
When you wear your heart there, this the puddle it leaves (I don't need love!)
It's the rebuttal of thieves
and chicks or crooks like you, so what'll it be?
She steal your heart, now she runnin the streets
Don't need the pain, man, troublin' me

[Chorus]
I don't need love ("I'll tell you that...")
I don't- .. ("I'll tell you that...")
I don't need love ("I'll tell you that...")
...need love ("I'll tell you that...")
...need love ("I'll tell you that...")
I don't need love ("I'll tell you that...")
I don't need love ("I'll tell you that...")
I don't need love ("I'll tell you that...")
...need love 

[Evidence]
While Kanye was chasin +Spaceships+ all over the nation
I was at the gravesite, face on the pavement
Left "College Dropout", first flight racin
from Scranton, Pennsylvania on a prop plane prayin
Heart 'bout to pop out my chest in Pittsburgh
Paranoid in first class, heard a voice *whisper* (Real talk)
Just touched back in LAX
and my phone starts buzzin to a thousand texts
Out the gate and runnin like I'm motorless
+I Still Love You+ explained if you don't know the rest
("...I wouldn't be able to spend as much time with my son"
