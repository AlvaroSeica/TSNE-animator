Yeah the weight is over y'all, finally
Yo I'm glad you bought this disc right here
It's my debut LP my name is Akrobatik and the album of course is called Balance
I'm glad you decided to join me on
Yo, I just wanna bring a little balance to the game cause you know
Too much of one thing is not good
Especially when it's some...but we ain't gonna get into that
Right now I just wanna take a minute to shout out
All the cats that lended their creative talents and soundscape to this album
Cause I think they deserve being off right now
Big up to my man T. the Beat Specialist, this is him right here check him out
Yeah big up to Fakts One, big up my men Edan, Illmind, DJ Sense, Mr. Lif
Big up to a true legend Diamond D, waddup big bro?
To my men The Accomplice Ray Fernandes, DJ Therapy
My man holdin' it down on the west coast DJ Revolution
Big up to the BK representing the Beatminerz
And last but not least my man D-Tension
Oh oh and I made one of them beats too joining Lif, y'know what I'm sayin'
Check it out! But enough talking let's get down to business, let's go

(Verse 1: Akrobatik)
Yo! Prepare for the ride
Cause you just found yourself a product that got somethin' real inside
Take the Time to Remind Your Soul about when brothers used to rhyme right
When it wasn't all about the Limelight
These clowns make me wonder where the Cooler Headz are runnin' to
We gotta be The Hand That Rocks The Crandle for the Woman II
Livin' in the city oh you can't be a Hypocrite
You can't Front with your Steps not even a little bit
Always Bet On Ak to Crush the Feedback
Makin' moves with my peoples as we Wreck Dem tracks
I did it all for you when I was up for the challenge
So Here And Now I present to you BALANCE!</pre>
