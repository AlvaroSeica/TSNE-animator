[Intro: Kryme Life]
Wooo, Yeah nigga that's what I'm talkin bout
Who the fuck got somethin to say, Nigga what
Staten Island in this motherfuckin house man
T.M.F., H.K. the three kings nigga
Staple City stand up, Hawk, Tell em

[Chorus 2X: Tommy Whispers, (Kryme Life)]
This is what it is, This is what it is
Don't tangle with them kids from across the bridge
Staten that is, (You musta lost your wigs)
(You came through reppin New York and still is)
(Officially we reppin New York and still is)

[Tommy Whispers]
Right in front of Pop I see those who make it hot
Let the heat go, Slingin them rocks watchin for cops
In the building lookin through the peep hole, The doors locked
Laughin at these blown white dudes, Wavin my glock
Stapleton the illest projects up on the rock
Try to be safe take the back blocks and get popped
There's not a corner in my hood where you won't get robbed
One bitch'll get you shot while she's slobbin your knob
We on our job, Twenty four-seven call us the mob
Extorted more dudes then Gotti and his goons
Pump shotty'll clear the room, Caught em shoppin at Oz
Blew a hole in his face and chipped the paint off the car
Nigga, We go hard, Killin all squads
Tommy aint playin with these Hollywood stars
The hood got me caught up like I'm locked in these bars
Nigga, I go hard

[Chorus with Kryme Life and Tommy Whispers trading verses]

[Kryme Life]
Who a threat, I turn now believers to believers
T.M.F. vets don't make me pull my sleeves up
And throw the heat up on your head like a fever
Burn that, Like a thermostat I could read ya boy
Check your temperature, No flow similar
Let it go, Thirty four fly out the cylinder
Now how you gone compare giants to a miniature
Yo I do a dirty pussy like vinegar
Squash squash and wash your interior
T.M.F. live in the flesh we superior
Niggas just not a success they inferior
You would think I was Mr. C, The finisher
Pumped off adrenaline these Gods for sendin em
It really don't matter if your male or your feminine
Come see Kryme it's a thirty bar minimum
Get Kryme killin off nouns and synonyms
Take em to court, Parker Report, Lay down laws
I'm out here pluckin em out, They on pause
My niggas still swimin in droughts so get yours

[Chorus]

[Kryme Life]
