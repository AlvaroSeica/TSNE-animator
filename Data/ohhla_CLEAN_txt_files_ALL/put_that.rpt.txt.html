(Intro)

(Verse 1: Kurupt)
When the acid rain falls
Your frame falls
I'll make your chains spark the lead, the chainsaws
I'm not captivated
And I'm not captive
Free as a bird to fly out on Perv
Ain't here for no frontin'
Just to say a little somethin'
Rack up the gauge, spray a lil' something'
My momma always told me
Right before she'd hold me:
"Look, don't tell me... Don't say it... Just show me"
Over and over again
It sunk in slowly
I'm a... bomb shell
Bomb-o-rama, high times is proper
I'm eqipped with 4 clips
And all the accessories
For all them Sesame Street G's
That pestin' me
Not servin' neccessaties
In the battle, I'm raw
Galactica, mother
Light 'em up like battle star
Galactica, mother

(Chorus)
I'ma show you how I do it over here (over here)
If you show me how you do it over there (over there)
I'm 'bout to get a meal ticket
Put that on something
I'm about to get payed
Put that on something
I put that on my momma
Put that on something
That's on e'rythang
Nigga, put that on something
I'm about to get a meal ticket
Put that on something
I'm about to get payed
Put that on something
I put that on my momma
Put that on something
That's on e'rythang
Nigga, put that on something
Put that on something...
Put that on something...
Nigga, put that on something...

(Verse 2: Kurupt)
I put that on my shoes and sox
My moms and my pops
My bomb drops, my 5 glocks, and my knots
How you gonna tell me what I'm gonna do?
When I'm not
When I'm hot
Is when you can consider it got
In one false move
Is when the vaults move
Cracked in the middle like eggs
Spread on the table
Your pulse halts
Boy, get your game together
This ain't to die together
?This ain't the ain't together?
Now ain't this somethin'?
A youngster just swerved up
The homie just swerved up
Hold up!
I'ma be goin' tonight
I ran into the homies
It's on tonight
I gotta throw on my stars and my khakis tonight


(Chorus)
I'ma show you how I do it over here (over here)
If you show me how you do it over there (what?!)
I'm 'bout to get a meal ticket
Put that on something
I'm about to get payed
Put that on something
I put that on my momma
Put that on something (Really?)
That's on e'rythang
Put that on something (For real)
I'm about to get a meal ticket
Put that on something
I'm about to get payed
Put that on something
I put that on my momma
Put that on something
That's on e'rythang
Put that on something
Yeah...
That's on the Pound, nigga
Put that on something
Fool, put that on something...


(Verse 3: Kurupt)
I know a few of y'all could ??? the time to spit off
After bustin' lead off
Knockin' a nigga head off
Fa sho
Hard core, fa sho
Predator
Mentor
Antra entrepenuer
