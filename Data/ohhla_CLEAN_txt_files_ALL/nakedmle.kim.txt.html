Ahh-ahh-hem, AH-AH-AHEM!!
{*singing*} Nah nah na nah, nah nah na-na-na-nah
Nah nah na-na nah, hit it!

[Ron Stoppable]
Yo listen up, have a holla from Ron
Naked Mole Rap is the name of the song (Word!)
Here's the story, in all its glory, ain't hidin nothin
You'll know what the truth is, how Ron met Rufus
Never heard a cat bark, never heard a puppy purr
My dad's allergic, to every kind of fur
So I searched for hairless pets on the internet
Saw a jpeg of a pink thing - GONNA NEED SUNSCREEN!

[Chorus: Ron Stoppable] + (girlie singers)
What is that? That freaky thing?
(Yes that's right, it's a naked mole rat)
Come on y'all.. let the girlies sing!
(Listen to the naked mole rap!)
Uh huh! What is that? That freaky thing?
(Yes that's right, it's a naked mole rat)
Hey wait, I can't hear the girls sing!
(Listen to the naked mole rap!)

[Rufus]
Yo kick it, uhh
Nah nah na nah, nah nah na-na-na-nah
Nah nah na-na nahhhhhhhh

[Ron Stoppable]
I heard Smartie Mart was havin a sale
On a hairless pink rodent with a long skinny tail (that's me!)
It seemed to be this good be a solution
The perfect pet for my dad's sensitive constitution!
So the manager came to open the cage
He said, "You know this pet's hairless?" I said I couldn't care less!
Handed him to me said, "Be careful don't drop it
And do you want this cage?" No, I'll keep him in my pocket! (Yay-hey!)

[Chorus: Ron Stoppable] + (girlie singers)
What is that? That freaky thing?
(Yes that's right, it's a naked mole rat)
Come on y'all.. let the girlies sing!
(Listen to the naked mole rap!) (Yay-hey!)
...
Uh what is that? That freaky thing?
(Yes that's right, it's a naked mole rat)
Ahh gonna buy me, some bling bling
(Listen to the naked mole rap!) {Oh yeahh}

[Ron Stoppable] + (Rufus)
Can I get a boo-ya? (BOO-YA!)
Can I get a boo-ya? (BOO-YA! WHEE)
Look at the camera, say "Cheese!" (Cheese!)
Smile for the camera say CHEEEEESE!!
We go to Bueno Nacho, chimerito and a naco
Always grande size it, why not? I'm buyin
Rufus in my pocket, you can't stop it
You can't top it, don't drop it, you might just pop it
Rufus and Ron Stoppable
With our best friend, Kim Possible
We're not afraid of any attack
I say "Yo K.P. we've got your back!" (Hi-yah!)

[Chorus: Ron Stoppable] + (girlie singers)
What is that? That freaky thing?
(Yes that's right, it's a naked mole rat)
Come on y'all.. let the girlies sing!
(Listen to the naked mole rap!)
Uhh, uhh, what is that, super freaky taing?
(Yes that's right, it's a naked mole rat)
Come on y'all.. let the girlies sing!
(Listen to the naked mole rap!)
(Listen to the naked mole rap!)
