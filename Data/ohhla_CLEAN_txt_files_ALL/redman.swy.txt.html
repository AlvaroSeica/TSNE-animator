[Redman]
Yo yo yo
I got the, forty acres, without the effin mule
Doc Ike Turner, givin mics audio abuse
I smack a big mouth trick, and her babysitter
and her lesbian friend, and that brother with her
I don't give a eff, I smack blood out a midget
My tactics make Evil Dee say, "Come on kick it!"
A black 5 with rims which you can spot me in
When I die, I snatch you like Doc Kervorkian
So turn the beat up, while NARC's got me on sweep up
I'm lucky, I usually tote more Gunz than Peter
I eff you up to where your forehead and cut meet up
You wanna box I +Square+ up more than Madison Arena</pre>
