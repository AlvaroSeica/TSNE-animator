[Intro: Wayne Marshall]
I'm a go I'm a go I'm a go I'm a go

[Chorus: Wayne Marshall] (Ace Hood)
From yuh seh hard mi go harder, this a di next episode inna di saga
Three hundred foot yacht pon di harbor
Private jet is a year plus three eighty we order
From yuh seh hard mi go harder, this a di next episode inna di saga
All mi son pampers dem a Prada (ACE HOOD!!!)  I'm a go harder
Mi seh I'm a go harder

[Verse One: Ace Hood]
I say now I'm a go hard, twenty model broads
Need a passport all these foreigns in my garage
I be shittin on these niggas, stuntin on these hoes
Rollie full of diamonds and neck is covered in gold
Say who want it with that boy, pussy rappers would avoid
Bitch I'm married to the game, ain't no way I get divorced
See I'm swimmin in the money talkin Michael Phelps nigga
Goin hard e'ryday, lookin at a go getter
I'm the realest in this shit, all my bitches super thick
Got 'em flashin in the club, ain't nobody take a pic
I'm goin hard....and gettin higher than a bitch
Talkin twenty bottles in me and pizza in the ville
GONE!

[Interlude: Wayne Marshall]
I'm a, I'm a, I'm a I'm a go hard, I'm a go hard, I'm a go hard (So watch a now)
I'm a, I'm a, I'm a I'm a go hard, I'm a I'm a I'm a I'm a I'm a go (So watch a now)

[Chorus: Wayne Marshall] (Cham)
From yuh seh hard mi go harder, this a di next episode inna di saga
Three hundred foot yacht pon di harbor

From yuh seh hard mi go harder, this a di next episode inna di saga
All mi son pampers dem a Prada I'm a go harder
Mi seh I'm a go harder (WOW WOW!!!)

[Verse Two: Cham]
Yah mon we lawless and we MEAN travel inna TEAM
Married to di hustle 'cause I love my money GREEN
Yuh know seh neva stop we always are on a scheme
I made my first milli from di age of seventeen
So all my homies haffi CLEAN dat a mi DREAM
Product of the ghetto under brand new REGIME
Drivin on bikinis and I fly gulf stream
Risin to di top we a nuh crop we a di creme
And ny daddy was abroad, him cut and leff di yard
But mama haffi eat so I was forced to hustle hard
Now we flashin credit card, have pitbull fi wi yard
Have police in my pocket how yuh mean my money broad!

[Interlude: Wayne Marshall]
I'm a, I'm a, I'm a I'm a go hard, I'm a go hard, I'm a go hard

[Chorus: Wayne Marshall] 
From yuh seh hard mi go harder, this a di next episode inna di saga
Three hundred foot yacht pon di harbor
Private jet is a year plus three eighty we order 
From yuh seh hard mi go harder, this a di next episode inna di saga
All mi son pampers dem a Prada I'm a go harder
Mi seh I'm a go hard...TRUE TRUE!!!

[Verse Three: Waka Flocka]
Girl back it up! Back it up! Back it up! Back it up! (HEY!)
