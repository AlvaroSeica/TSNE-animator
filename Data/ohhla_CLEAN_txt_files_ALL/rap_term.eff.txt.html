("Terminator, Terminator, Terminator, Terminator")

[MC Esoteric]
People here I am and here I am people
When I'm on this mic, I say what has to be said
I'm lethal, rap terminator, terminal
You don't even piss at a urinal
You don't even piss standin vertical
Talkin that man up, clam up
You could point a 9 at the crowd 
and never get the fans hands up
So whatchu talkin 'bout? Packin a +Cannon+?
C'mon man, you must carry bags for Nick or Dyan
And as sick as I am, I wouldn't wish this verse
on my most pirating fan, I get biz like
Milk Dee and Giz, put in work like John {?} wiz
Hide your motherfuckin kids
You're NERF soft, I know you sit at home and jerk off
to Rick Ross with his shirt off - that's disgusting!
First off, Abdullah tits, you don't wanna fool with this
You got a Steve Perry +Heart+ with that +Foolish+ shit

[Chorus: Milk Dee samples]
"Your rhymes are old, they're dusty" ("You wanna-")
"Point blank homeboy, you're rusty" ("You wanna rap-")
"Your rhymes are old, they're dusty" ("You wanna-")
"Point blank homeboy, you're rusty" ("You wanna rap-")
"Your rhymes are old, they're dusty" ("You wanna-")
"Point blank homeboy, you're rusty" ("You wanna rap-")
( "You wanna rap with me, I'm a rap aider
   You wanna rap against me, I'm a rap terminator!"
