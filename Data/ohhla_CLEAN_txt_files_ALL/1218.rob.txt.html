[Lil Rob]
1-2-1-8 (Lookin' hella mean in my 1218's)
Look-lookin' hella mean in my 1218's
(Lookin' hella mean in my 1218's)
Tighter than some 1218's two sizes small (1-2-1-8)
1218 1218 Look-lookin' hella mean in my 1218's
(Lookin' hella mean in my 1218's)
Tighter than some 1218's two sizes small (1-2-1-8)

[Lil Rob]
There ain't no stoppin' I'm droppin' the bomb shit
The way that you need, the way that you want shit
You must be on shit if you thought that I lost it
LR the great, 1-2-1-8
Hey check this out homeboy I'm back up on the front line
It took some time but shit didn't have to cut lines
Hey fuck your rhymes if you ever said fuck mine
I'm just playin', we should work on somethin' some time
I don't think so, you burned your bridges here
Rob don't show no love, love ain't fuckin' livin' here
1-2-1-8 1218, what's that mean?
Hit the scene, crisp and clean
clear it all up like antihistamines
I spit so sick it's fuckin' sickening
I spit so sick I think I might need Listerine
Fuck it up whether you like it not
Chances are you're gonna like it a lot, how could you not?
I kid you not, I hit the spot, like I hit the weed
Like a fiend hits the crystal rock
I keep it old school like lockin' and poppin'
till the day I'm dropped in a coffin

[Chorus]
There ain't no stoppin' I'm droppin' the bomb shit
The way that you need, the way that you want shit
You must be on shit if you thought that I lost it
Or think that I'ma quit after all that it costed
There ain't no stoppin' I'm droppin' the bomb shit
The way that you need, the way that you want shit
You must be on shit if you thought that I lost it
LR the great, 1-2-1-8

[Lil Rob]
Ese Lil Rob's back so you best back the fuck up
Quit your bluffin', poutin', huffin' and puffin'
I come in and keep it all the way live
I'm the vato with the CD that looks like a 45
People mistake me for a criminal
I'm into music though homeboy, and I keep it so original
There is no equal, you can't find it
You can add it, divide it, subtract it or multiply it
I'm like a drug you get addicted when you try it
Can't fight the feeling, don't even try to fight it
If you don't like me, it's best to keep it quiet
I can't wait until we wake up the sleeping giant (Shhhh)
I stay silent and I don't really like to get violent
So you can tell the real from the fake
I'm real LR the great, 1-2-1-8

[Chorus]

[Lil Rob]
(Lookin' hella mean in my 1218's)
Look-lookin' hella mean in my 1218's
(Lookin' hella mean in my 1218's)
Tighter than some 1218's two sizes small
(Lookin' hella mean in my 1218's)
Look-lookin' hella mean in my 1218's
(Lookin' hella mean in my 1218's)
Tighter than some 1218's two sizes small

[Chorus] - 2X</pre>
