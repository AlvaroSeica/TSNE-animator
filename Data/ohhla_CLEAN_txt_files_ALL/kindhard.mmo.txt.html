[Intro: Triggnomm (Itchy-Fingas)]
Eh-yo yo son, come on come on
We gotta hit this flight 304 today
(Yo why these airline police keep watchin' me?)
Fuck them, man, come on (Toy cops)

[Naisha]
I'm flyin on the Kennedy airline fog, the demon in me
Street life of Benny, blunt go to Hiroshimi
Custom mine, all broads be fresh in Versace
Dwellin' on the daily, not me, sippin' on Nani
In the splills, Jumanji, skies red like Blood Money
Scramble my life fully, rockin' G.S. gulleys
Under the moon light, sippin' fruit wine
Float like fruit flies, dominate the skies, realize
Keep your Nino's up high and notify this crime size
Naisha in camouflage pistol-whippin' wise guys
Supreme large, I pop you to the Heavens of all Gods
To generate, C.S.G. all-stars, fuck it, let's take it back to mirage
Street war stars, hate to bust my gun from afar
The Messiah Allah, tote me shit from here to Hong Kong
Naisha to bomb, sincerely the Don, blow holes all in your cranium
Camaro S.S., rollin' up cess, a gun in your vest
It's business, so the topic's at rest
It's like Capone and Nes', 'nough powder to bless
Lace it, divide the cut in, this fresh linen I soaked in it
Soon arrive the endin', over the scrimmage
Reptilian, King pinnin', y'all niggaz caught feelin's

[Break: Triggnomm (Itchy-Fingas) {Naisha}]
Yo yo (Yo yo yo, you feel that?)
{Come on what's the deal?}

[Chorus 2X: Naisha (Triggnomm)]
It's kinda hard growin' up in these streets, you feel me?
(Son it's hard rockin' killas to sleep) I feel you
The twelve on the clock always symbolize you
So be ready when them hands should just swing by you

[Triggnomm]
Back in the days, Daddy-O, he told me numbers don't lie
What you gon' try, if I tell you bring me back seven-five?
No shake on the raw, no chips off the rock
Round the clock dough operate, low aggravate
Cream Team's to set things straight
Speakin' loud and clear, one point five a year, now we can go there
Make it official, bring in the missles then bring the pistols
Ain't satisfied 'til I hit you when I get you
Crystal, when the beef was hot, should've bit you
The ordeal, kill my taste buds and tranquil'
Murderholic, I can't call it, I might spoil it
Have your whole team in the court house, clean the toilets
Got convicted, the judge says I'm crime addicted
Rhyme explicit, supporters show signs and pickets
Makin' me a statistic? Hated it and got away with it
Livin' in this game of life, know how to play with it
So you could die young, or live to see your grandson
The greatest man alive was sacrificed for ransom

[Chorus 2X]

[Itchy-Fingas]
Peep the mirage that I've spit when rhymes kick for the nine-ish
We bomb then we stomp like the chinks in Saigon
My two's sippin' on like Fairytalez with raw deal but it's all real
We rock from Steel Wheel to Park Hill to Oak Hill
Guard your grill, knuckle or what.. {*censored*}
Put four in ya man gut, he tryin' to shine like King Tut
Infiltratin' the operation'll cause devestation to the nation
I'm prepared for what I'm facin' before y'all's the Tang and
Shake game when I'm snatch that, wanna scrap? Where ya raps at?
Wanna bang? Where ya gats at? Hiatus, why hate us?
Heavyweighters, ghetto classics, iced out, fitted backwards
Grey caskets, since they all stress, one day you'll rest
Tomorrow never dies, we gon' start this off fresh.. this

[Chorus 2X]

[All - repeat to fade]
It's kinda hard, money, it's kinda hard
It's kinda hard, money, it's kinda hard

[Outro: Triggnomm (Naisha)]
It's kinda hard (gettin' money)
it's kinda hard, it's kinda hard
It's kinda hard growin up
Naisha, Triggnomm.. (it's kinda hard puttin' killas to sleep)
It's kinda hard.. that's how it is
(M.M.O, Deadly Venoms, K.G.B.) Triggnomm (A.T.L.)
It's kinda hard gettin' food to eat
The foundation (what?) M.M.O. (M.M.O.)</pre>
