[Akrobatik]
If you brought your attitude in the spot, then GET IT OUT
Ladies got your hair permed, you 'bout to SWEAT IT OUT
Let's make it worth your dough, befo' you HEAD IT OUT
Get live, LET IT OUT; c'mon and LET IT OUT

Yo, keep the peace while I'm freein the beast
The album set for its US and European release
I make you bounce just like a street hustler seein police
When Akrobatik's in the place the wack emceein decrease!
(PERCEPTIONISTS) Regulator with some shit you'll never hear on no elevator
Creators and devastators, you know we'll never hesitate
to leave you surprised with, that hip-hop hybrid
Now open your eyelids, to fly shit!

[Mr. Lif]
My pilot like a pirate on the seven seas
Ignite the mic with an eleven steez
Body of Christ nice, I slice shiest, that's German for certain
Under shit you oughta be learnin
Jesus, eases, for rockin the sleeveless
Wife beater, I'm the motherfucker light breeder
Send your chest when I whisper fresh
Brother think they def then you sink to death, take a breath

[Akrobatik]
Make a left at the door if you ain't ready for the raw
Carnivore, power source that bust through armor doors
Like a batterin ram I'm shatterin jams
I'm leapin in the crowd like I'm Baccarat Lambo
You slackers in Sambos, a strike you can't handle
My rap's Rambo and Commando's, strictly because you can't flow
Maniac material that murder the dance flo'
Enhance shows I guarantee another advance yo

[Chorus: Akrobatik]
If you brought your attitude in the spot, then GET IT OUT
Ladies got yo' hair permed, you 'bout to SWEAT IT OUT
Let's make it worth your dough, befo' you HEAD IT OUT
Get live, LET IT OUT; c'mon and LET IT OUT
Yo, it's the Boston brothers that y'all done READ ABOUT
Sucka rappers heard we was comin they JETTED OUT
AND whether if you faded or peezy or DREADED OUT
Get live, LET IT OUT; c'mon and LET IT OUT

[Mr. Lif]
I'm a cool little nigga when I flip at night
Like stripe, my mechanical, might jab her right
Rollin in a tank with center bites
Step in the center bombs, before I jump in the tron
Soup bowl and beat bro, when you're in a trance I'm in a stance
B-boy, yeah the actual McCoy, just dance
I rep with the sidestep 'til the sky's wet
I'm the one anomaly that hasn't been sniped yet

[Akrobatik]
Yo, brothers got an album deal all for the solo hype
Now we 21st century rap prototypes
Rappers mad at us because they don't do they promo right
And all they worry 'bout is who they look in they photo like
But me and Lif is like Luke Skywalker, Hans Solo like
Pimpin any rap like Magic Juan and Dolomite
Takin over shit like Bush took over your voter rights
That's why we all about that fuckin check the promoter writes

[Mr. Lif]
I let bass go, the shit'll rip off your face though
We're the ones with all the clout the brothers will say so
So we say go away, you stay
Tell the rest of them rappers to go pray, they're prey
Use left arm drop bomb
Operation crush planet Earth right palm
Brother there's no tomorrow, we make time hollow
Sorrow, better take notes and just follow

[Chorus]

[Outro: Akrobatik]
Yo, Akrobatik, Mr. Lif
Fakts One, hot shit uhh
Yeah...</pre>
