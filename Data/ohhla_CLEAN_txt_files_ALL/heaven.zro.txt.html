(Talking)
Microphone check-one,two
Z-Ro the crooked in the buildin'-ya'll know me
but I'd like to introduce to you a friend of mine
we go way,way,way back-Rother Vandross
so uhhh if you will,if you please

(Z-Ro)
Sittin in the courtroom waitin'on the outcome
prosecuters don't want me to go back to my house-huh
right here,right now-he wanna lock me up
he probably wish another negro brother would've shot me up
and he don't even know me,he just know what he read
but as long as Jesus didn't write it then he might be mislead
even if he know I'm a good person - he would still be trippin
innocense or guilt,don't matter-he tryna get a conviction
day before yesterday,I saw a child get forty-years
Time gets passed out like candy,and single mothers shed tears
Me,myself-I'm facin 2-2 and it's messed up huh
goin to trial for somethin'I got a prescription for
No attempted murder,no aggrivated assaults
never ran away from the police,didn't have to be caught
and before I beat on a woman,I'll make my exit
the quickest way to get a five year sentence down in Texas
I walk a straight and narrow,though at times I fall off
but I ain't down nothin'to nobody so call the dogs off
my auntie somethin like a doctor
she prescribed Isaiah 54:17 "No weapon formed against me shall prosper"
and I believe it too cause I been in some tight spots
no matter what I was facin'Jesus was always in the right spot
now I can put my hands on ya,but I can't touch ya
and when you touch me back-you say thanks,don't worry bout nothin'-cause you with meeeeeeeee
and me,leavin you alone-could never beeeeeeee
even if I'm facin'a army
ain't no way they can harm me-I'm a stone
I gotta go thru it alittle while but not for long
'cause pretty soon I'll be home
then I won't have to look for Heaven in a woman no mo'
baby mama drama,and fake ass friends
and jealousy and envy,it all came to an end
cause finally I'm....In Heaven
"how you doin mama-I haven't seen you in such a long time"
Grandma Betsie too
and Dj Screw
H.A.W.K and Big Moe and P-A-T
and the whole S.U.C.

(Chorus)
When I'm sleep or out on my grind-I dream of Heaven-Heaven
When I'm facin'the worse of times-I can still feel Heaven-Heaven-Heaven</pre>
