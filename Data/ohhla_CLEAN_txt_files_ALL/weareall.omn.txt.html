[Chorus]
hey brazil put your candle in the air come on
we are all we have
??? put your candle in the air come on
we are all we have
vancouver put your candle in the air come on
we are all we have
africa put your candle in the air come on
we are all we have

[Omni]
red, black, and green patches on my jacket seam
martin luther had a dream
malcolm was on the scene
praisin' ali to lead my heart and made em believe
gone deeper unto the roots and found truth from the east
I aware whats out there urban warfare disease
people riot on the street for peace
dead presidents can testify but they cant put out our
so we exercise and legalize
own more boats from over seas filled with refugees
can gods power fall back and left legacies
nothing left but old remedies and vague memories
takes love to change a era big up to che guevera
only we can change the world or teach a old man how to behave
who's stuck in his ways
if there's a will there's a way
at the end of the day
we say

[Chorus]
we are all we have
melbourne put your candle in the air come on
we are all we have
eh chicano put your candle in the air come on
we are all we have
london put your candle in the air come on
we are all we have
dublin put your candle in the air come on
we are all we have

[other rapper]
the way my country men are acting I'm so concerned
I never hated anyone for what they were
just what there weren't
for the cross they burned
almost can't blame them this is what they learned
they divide themselves
and the sun of islam would be a martyr soon
and the lessons they learn will be the hardest ones
were taking steps back from how far weve come where the heart has come.
on before __
family on the streets ploys tested with the youth
march em fill of truth ask em for the proof before we go to war
not after we reduce our country to a mine field
for I ??? rhyme skill
???
my time will
I'm still hopeful that all the faithless
will take this mess of hate
and start to make sense

[Chorus]
bridgetown put your candle in the air come on
we are all we have
new york put your candle in the air come on
we are all we have
tokyo put your candle in the air come on
we r all we have
bangkok put your candle in the air come on
we are all we have

[other rapper 2]
when the streets run ???
and police run ???
????? leash untied
??? is typically in the city like a grinding symphony
my heart beats desire with the fires of industry
seriously take these ???? to heart
we takin' ?????
and we bust in the streets
through the duskets a ????
it won't cease
till they each find justice and peace
??? the gritty concrete's the same color in every sister city
so we can to uplift the shitty mind state
to try and break all this worldwide hate
from adalay to la
everywhere ??? mate
???? bombing of innocence
women, men and children
these horrors are limitless
and you don't really know a person ????
'cause knowing people and knowing humanity are two separate things

[Chorus]
adalay put your candle in the air come on
we are all we have
lebanon put your candle in the air come on
we are all we have
sidney put your candle in the air come on
we are all we have
la put your candle in the air come on
we are all we have</pre>
