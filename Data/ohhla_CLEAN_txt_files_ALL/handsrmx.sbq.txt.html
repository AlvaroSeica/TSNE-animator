[Intro: Lissie]
Crush a bit, little bit, roll it up, take a hit {*3X*}
Feeling lit, feeling light, 2 a.m., summer night
Hands on the wheel, uhh-uh, fuck that {*3X*}
Hands on the wheeeeeeeeel~!

[ScHoolboy Q]
Life for me is just weed and brews
See the hoes flock to you when your name is Q
Am I overfaded? Hell yeah it's true
Turn a beat on ain't no limit on what I can do
See this top dog in heat, but I'ma fuck the world
I'ma be on tunes 'til God refurls
You sat me down, I'm still tryin to get higher
You looked at me stupid when I twisted the fire
Meanwhile my nigga drunk as fuck
A nigga fucked up, we all fucked up
You done fucked up, I brought mo' blunts
Smoke back to up, you niggaz know what's up
Too damn high, can't stand myself
I love drunk drivin, man I'm something else
Heat on my side, you're more than welcome to melt
I'm 'bout to finish a pound, you're more welcome to help
Hey~!

[Chorus: ScHoolboy Q]
Weed and brews, weed and brews, life for me is just weed and brews {*2X*}
I fucked her once then I could fuck her twice
Yeah you heard me right I might fuck tonight
I fucked her once then I could fuck her twice
Yeah you heard me right I might fuck tonight
  Hands on the wheel, uhh-uh, fuck that {*3X*}
  Hands on the wheeeeeeeeel~!

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
Wait hold up, back in this motherfuckin bitch once again
It's the pretty motherfucker with a 40 ounce of brew
My nigga Q and we drunker than a bitch
We gettin Millers motherfucker yeah, uh
Nigga weed and brews, unbelieveable
Got a freak or two, in my vehicle
Got the purple drink, got the yellow drink
Then we mix it up, call it Pikachu
A little bit of crack, little bit of dope
Little bit of smoke, little coke, little weed when they on them pills
Little bit of E, little bit of shrooms
Little bit of deuce, what it do, hand on the wheels
And I keep the illest, trillest bitches while I'm swaggin it
Crush a bit, little bit, that's my pursuit of happiness

[Chorus]

[Ke'Ondris]
Yo, yo yo yo - I'm so high up in the motherfucker
Can you go and get a white girl with a fat ass and all black like damn!
Better yet go and get a black girl
with big tit to act white like all her friends
Bones crack-alackin-lackin-lackin-lackin-lack-a-ling
My snake is rat-tat-tat tat-tattling
She blowin me up like an atomic bomb
inside of a toxic factory
Why you so mad at me? Wanna go underneath?
She undercover, never goin any further
Wanna go and take a hit of the weed
and sip on this gasoline
I can't believe what I'm seein
Yo' ass too phat in them jeans
So~! Let me demonstrate, mother and them hating
Between her cheek, what she make? Lemonade
With my tangerines, head tighter than a braid
Comin back from the supermarket with some grade A eggs!
Yeah, ha ha ha ha ha! 2012
Yeah uhh, new beginnings
You'll see a lot more of me - Ke'Ondris</pre>
