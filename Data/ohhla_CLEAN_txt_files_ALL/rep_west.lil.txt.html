Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I rep the west bitch and I throw hammers
Shout out to New York I'm a go bananas
I fuck that bitch in the new Bentley
This new year's off in to [?] send me
This new year bitch I got a lot to be
I keep my eyes open in these fucking streets
I'm a pretty bitch and I fucking kill you
It's like Chicago cause I fucking drill you
It's 2 time I fin to go to work
On the west side, we smoke a lot of purp
On the west side, we toll ratchets
I'm like an airport, cause I stay packing
Where's that girl in the red heels
I might buy the bitch cause I'm too real
Every hoe got a price on the fucking hit
Nigga know I came straight from the fucking grave
Man I feel like I'm down here west open
Man I'm fin to fuck the whole and east open
Nigga I stay pretty bout my fucking cheese
Got 50 grand me, the bitches they leave
Niggas ask me what the fuck is my problem
I'm a ball for my niggas cause they shot him
I'm a ball for my niggas in the fucking grave
I'm a tell you like this I'm a bust his head

[Chorus: x2]
Niggas asking bout me, I'm a rep the west
Niggas asking bout me, I'm a rep the west
Niggas asking bout me, I'm a rep the west
Niggas asking bout me, I'm a rep the west

Shout out to mack maine, woody, birdman, lil wayne, that's the homie
I might buy some pussy cause I'm lonely
I'm a fuck the bitch cause she owe me
I'm a be my bitch like today Christmas
I'm a whoop the hoe cause the bitch tripping
Man you know about the niggas out in the west
I took that charge and I'm a still rep
Bitch tryina talk shit cause he think I'm square
Bitch I'm bout square as your fucking head
Bitch I'm bout square as that money here
And I throw some cash in the fucking air
Pretty ass bitch pussy ass still local
I'm bout worldwide like the locomotive
Bitch pop a little pussy for Russell Simmons

[Chorus: x2]
Niggas asking bout me, I'm a rep the west
Niggas asking bout me, I'm a rep the west
Niggas asking bout me, I'm a rep the west
Niggas asking bout me, I'm a rep the west</pre>
