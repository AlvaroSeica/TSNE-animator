I can't understand it V the beat bandit 
who bring heat from the mic unhanded 
who ever go after burn their hands and lips 
a lot of rappers ran and abandon they whips

It's just another day in the Dunia
don't leave your girl around V he might swoon her
up and under the window serenade her like a crooner
stay ahead of the game and cut her off sooner rather later

Use her to gather data
scoop her in the butter soft moon roof Navigator
or the Land or the Lex or the Benz
a hundred and sixteenth buy the hours from the africans

But they won't let you push 'em
one tried to get fly, almost had to mush him
If I wanted to rob him, I would've worn a mask
hit him with the fo', took the dough and tore ass

Want not, waste not, front not
they didn't see him dippin to the fiftycent blunt spot
V walk the town with space boots space suits
fucked up cut but she still say his face cute

Told the streets, what you staring at?
the sewer cap opened up and said: WHY YOU WEARING THAT?
He said "Oh you wanna snap, pissface, 
the way you in everybody's business is a disgrace"

At the park gate "Hark who goes there?"
It's V the MC who's nasty as nosehair
you may go he said you should've been say so
tipped him in cash and Argentinian pesos

There you go, my good man
buy something nice for the seed
and please keep it moving twice the speed
consider that your fair warning
or else I'll bring it to you express like airborne

Vaughn, drop a turd on the beat
and shoutout that little bird for the word on the street
he write VIK in a sick demented handstyle
and go bombin with a chick who whip a rented van while 
all he say is you nuts
he really had enough of poo puts and crewcuts

Soup's on and I got a coupon
chinese restaurant asking for the Grey Poupon
he said "No, duck sauce soy sauce
And this ain't no Burger King so you no get no toy boss"

Uh oh it's beer o'clock, I think I'm sober
how about we think this over, over a can of king cobra
you ain't nicer than a lunatic schiester
aka the vicster, or the vic miceter
he wondered should he get a baldie
or keep his edge up, v-shaped like by my waldy

But that is the question, he wonders why he always
wearing hats in the sessions
listen up, new drink
named it after Chong's daughter
triple shot of 'gac, with the chaser of bong water
V a strong supporter
a triple shot of 'gac, with the chaser of bong water
come on bring the slaughter</pre>
