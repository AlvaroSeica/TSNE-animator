(*talking*)
Yo (whomp), yo (fuck that nigga)
(whomp-whomp),  I don't if it's a out of town place or what
Know I'm saying, but like ya know but where we from
We ain't into all that motherfucking talking, or that yapping
That motherfucking running your lip, bumping your gums
Letting your fucking teeth get to know eachother
Or whatever you wanna call that there ya heard me, (yo)
Yo, (what ya gon' do cuzin) it's F.E.
 
[Fiend]
I'll lay a nigga down right now, if he fuck with me
Don't what he drinking thinking, in front of these bitches trying to get tough with me
He must be crazy, puffing that hazy
All I know, is that bitch better leave all that stunting to Baby
Cause I don't know you enough, to wrestle and box
Got me a 4-4 for your bluff, that henchman coch
And I don't think, you seen hate like this
Crucified with tray of nails in his wrists, meet the monster nigga
Trife on me, keep that pack and that knife on me
No psych ain't phony, simply I ain't right homie
Coming where I'm from, talkers don't use tongues
Usually it's the news and the dum-dum, you want some
 
[Hook - 2x]
You get your mouth wired up, trying to get fired up
You get your mouth wired up, trying to get fired up
You get your mouth wired up, trying to get fired up
Uh I said it, and I mean it (whomp)
 
[Fiend]
I make examples out of niggaz, pistol handle in palm
I get that trample out of niggaz, hit your block with a bomb
I dismantle all you bitches, my pleasure to do you harm
I'm a animal with sickness, already you done been warned
And I cock back on a fully automatic, have you in that long black Caddy
It's on so bring the nigga kids, and say so long to they daddy
Talking got them without a pappy, yapping got you up in some shit
Gun clapping on a nigga understand, and I hope you brung your shit
Cause I'ma bang bang, throw up my gang gang
Let that rain rain, to me it ain't no thang thang
I got my Nikes laced tight, fuck them thangs and that knife
You about to get the beating of your life, (whomp-whomp)
