Verse 1

Yo stop breathin fog on my window
I reconfigured ya pixel the icon set and ok buttons
modems frontin on connection rates
switchin compo datd transfer levels at twenty four hundred baud
livin large like 2000 terrorists up to 30 90
just been promoted to device manager check my stats on Britannica
encyclopedia read only media
hidden directories will pass from protection
you know my steez it's necessary to know
my flow has been existing and programmed to be equipped with
the ill shit that most can't get with
my linguistics bring the noise 
making connections fail overload your box so you know that 
{You've Got Mail}
minimize operations control panel hiatus
I dropped the DOS van and lost studies of Office nations
It's obsolete nineteen ninety five was dead
now it's nineteen ninety eight were takin over this place
fuck Bill Gates I macro hard takin offices for hostage
all the way from 686 to 808 pc imposters
many tower boxes stuffed with too many peripheral
devices concise with mechanisms
caught a crisis in them I'm IBM compatible
with any Macintosh contender cath me loungin at the task bar
with alcohol the caps lock pickin up the tab
take my controller off to next delete ya mother fucker out the lad

{dj scratching with windows sounds}

Verse 2

Fully activated forever in a workshop
the universal sys ops is not my protocol
we hack through great codes step through busted windows
where silicon chips grow crushin plastic landscape
from Pentium to N e x adjust our broken keyboards
restoring all mainframes and slice the phone line
on the internet I roam across eternal syndrome
chrome plated logitechs directs me towards the next intersection
encrypting information I damage workstations
deface the databases like a race for technology
when deep inside the sectors of a one gig harddrive
I'm liver with no tpye of power management
prevent all viruses searching for connects
now uploading my thoughts make your hardware go soft
I melt through ya modem cuz I'm powered off radium
waitin for selection of a hidden icon
a pointin device that can slice through menus
continuing to wreck disecting all websites
consuming the contents of a chat room thats wack
I react making service collapse now hows that
drop it with the carrier or three hundred baud
navigatin through directories and instant memory
deep embedded in your system on excursion you can find me
tryin to download the ninety nine beta version

Not enough memory for ya Windows
POW! all systems are down
Not enough memory for ya Windows
POW! all systmes are down

Not enough memory for ya Windows
ya Windows ya Windows
Windows 98
