[Verse One]
Oh here we go again, mics pissed off
Rhyme for a year think he's all Hip Hop
Well excuse me please Mr. 10 year veteran
It looks like the fame might be going to your head again
Look I've had it up to hear, always talking me down
Bossing me around, scared I'm taking your crown
Not even in the slightest
Ya we'll see
Man you wouldn't write shit if it wasn't for me
You Ain't have no cd's no free beats, no trips you
Ain't Grateful for none of that shit
wait run it back kid, you Ain't paid me a buck
why you think I never had money for that stuff
Cause you cant keep a job
Man neither can you
I left home in 98' mom and pops still ya crew
Fuck it I'll get personal, put it in perspective
You grew up with a silver spoon and  never learned a lesson
Everything was handed to you
That wasn't my choice, mom and dad only had enough
money for only one boy
And that's me more skill more sick more ill
more spit more flow, let's go, no joke
No bro let me tell them how it really is
I'm more ill more balanced more real and more talented

We constantly have these rivalries {*5X*}
Okay enough with the singer man I thought you were a mc
Ya I spit raw, and sing a smooth melody
I'm multi talented, you stick to the basics
You find what you good at and never ever change it
Ya I found what I'm good at, I say I got a formula
Still keep it fresh not the same old boring stuff
Everyday you call tho
Bro you're the sickest just give me a beat man come on
I'm fuckin rippin'
Some things never change
Ya I'm still getttin hand outs, jsut got my first pair of Hammer pants now
You a second rate rapper
What? Gettin better cause I rhymed for a year and your boys think I'm better
Ohhhh, I'll give you credit you can rhyme
But you only just started and already in your prime
Your only going down while I'm slowly going up
Gettin higher in this game while your only smokin up
Fuck you!!!
Fuck you!!!!!
Bitch I've had it with your attitude
Ya but I'm your brother so really what can ya do?
Your still gonna give me beats for free
Your right, I hope you blow yo your signed to half life
And that's me more smart more skill more sick more ill
more spit, more flow, let's go, no joke
No bro let me tell them how it really is
I'm more ill more balanced more real and more talented</pre>
