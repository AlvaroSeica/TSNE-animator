[ VERSE 1: MC Eiht ]
Yo, I got a word for a skee tryin to bust me
All they gotta do is just give up that pussy
Girls, save the drama, cause I know you're in heat
Spread your legs and get ready for the Compton meat
I'm a hound, cause the twat makes the Eiht go wild
Throw your legs on my shoulder, or doggy style
Got to play the role like a punk-ass skee
Next thing that you know is, you give it to me
Girls in Compton say they ain't with it
Save the drag, stupid bitch, in other words, quit it
Cause I deliver quick fast like Roto-Rooter
Say the dick ain't potent, crazy duck, I shoot her
First you tell me 'no', then you tell me 'yes'
In a week you're sayin 'maybe', then you say 'I guess'
??? Compton ain't the Eiht, so what
All I know is that I'm a pussy hound, and you got to give it up

[ CHORUS ]
	(Give it up, you give it up
	You know what's on my mind
	Give it up, you give it up now
	You been wasting too much time)

[ VERSE 2: Tha Chill ]
I know you're frontin like a virgin queen
But Tha Chill is on attack smooth, more like a hype sex fiend
Give it up, don't play dumb, sayin what?
I got a little love, because my hand's on your butt
Girls walk, girls talk, girls talk smack
Don't play him, cause Chill ain't goin out like that
Shake your tight butt while you rock to the beat
Then you hound like a female dog in heat
Girls, I see the games that you're playin
Moment I arrive in the pussy, bitch, start prayin
Kotex, I fill it, girls too serious
Down some satin to the head, then I fuck you on your period
My dick's on hard while I'm rhymin
I want the real pussy, to hell with the grindin
I don't show no mercy
So go ahead and curse me
Chill gives a fuck
So yo, give it up

	(Give it up, you give it up)
	(Make love to me)
	(Make love to me)
	(Give it up, you give it up)
	(You know I will make love to you)
	(I wanna fuck you)	
	(Give it up, you give it up)
	(I want a blowjob, and I'm not kiddin)
	(Give it up, you give it up)
	(Wing-ding-ding-a-ling down your throat)

[ VERSE 3: MC Eiht ]
Not a drag, so why you play me like a kitten?
Straighforward to the point, girl, no bullshittin
We can get loaded, and as you get hot
Think a plot you can drop, yo, it pops on the twat
Juice me like a fruit, but you know it ain't cute
Stinky slut, Eiht'll give your punk ass the boot
Cause I'm the type of brother who don't waste time
With the fancy-ass dress and red roses and wine
I'm a Compton nigga, Compton got it goin
Peace to the Compton girls, because they hoein
So if another brother try to call you a skee
Fuck the shit that he's talkin, you can skid to E

[ VERSE 4: Tha Chill ]
Here's the final word to the girls that skip
Should they give it up, E? (Hell geah)
Chill is ready for the ultimate takin
Got no time for no bitch that's fakin
Let me be the first to break you in
Another skee comes along, and yo, I'm in like Flynn
You say it's too soon, I don't give a fuck
But if the E want some (Bitch, we got to toss you up)
It's simple, don't try to front like you don't know
But if you skee with Tha Chill, then you got to be a hoe
No draggin, no laggin, and please stop naggin
Chill is ready for the fuck
So yo, give it up

[ CHORUS ]

	(Give it up, you give it up)
	(We wanna fuck you)
	(Give it up, you give it up)
	(Compton's Most Wanted)
	(Give it up, you give it up)
	(Biiitch)
	(I wanna fuck you too)
	(Give it up, you give it up)
	(Whose pussy is this?
	Who's it?)
	(Give it up, you give it up)
	(It's yours) (yours) (yours)
	(Yeah, I'm tryin to dog the best I can
	??? as I enjoy it)</pre>
