Uh-huh...
And we do it like..
Yeah yeah, I've heard it before
It's just a bunch more words that I'm sure to ignore
This time I'll need evidence, you know exhibit A
And if it's secret, leak it, give it away
You'll drop hints, but never a fact
And it's a trap, gonna have to do better than that
I don't wanna be a fool, I'm feeling naive
So please write it all down, leave it easy to read
In clear, concise, nice plain English
I get tripped up trying to distinguish
The pimp from the pastor, meek from the moocher
So tell me then, are you a friend or a user?
Who sets a trap like a web to a fly
So come right and exact, look me dead in the eye
And don't sell me, promise me, tell me
Honestly, why

[Chorus: Andy Cooper]
Can you give me some kind of sign?
A meaning defined so I can believe
Can you give me a way to be sure?
I can trust in your word
Cause that's what I need
Can you give me a reason for change?
You'll need to explain so I can believe
Can you give me a moment of truth?
And indisputable proof cause that's what I need
Because I wanna believe... I wanna believe
Because I wanna believe... I wanna believe

[Andy Cooper]
Okay, I made my point, I'll need to see it to believe it
And anyway, faith is so inconvenient
Dealing with the guilt, feeling hypocritical
I just end up being sick and miserable
Life's fast, I need to try to maximize (Yup!)
Self gratify, till I collapse and die
And What then? I don't wanna think about it
It's too deep, I gotta keep my head clouded
So give me entertainment and happy pills
And we'll pretend it's all sunshine and daffodils
It's what I've done since I was two years old
And if it's true you can lose your soul
Well, I just laugh at your statement of facts
Don't say absolute, you'll get taken to task
I don't really wanna change and my life is in vain
Then I ask

[Chorus: Andy Cooper]
Can you give me some kind of sign?
A meaning defined so I can believe
Can you give me a way to be sure?
I can trust in your word
Cause that's what I need
Can you give me a reason for change?
You'll need to explain so I can believe
Can you give me a moment of truth?
And indisputable proof cause that's what I need
Because I wanna believe... but I don't wanna believe
Because I wanna believe... but I don't wanna believe
I wanna believe... 
...but I don't wanna believe

No way, man!
