[Intro: Prodigal Sunn]
Yeah baby
Just landed on fresh grounds
Yo what up baby?
Yo what up son? I'm at the airport baby
Everyday..
B.K., L.A., son, yeah
Yeah, uh-huh, yeah, yeah
Sunzini the Great, baby
Two On Da Road, S.O.M., baby
Uh-huh, J. Wellz, baby
We represent, yeah
Uh-huh, yeah

[Chorus: Prodigal Sunn]
Sunzini gon' blow for sho, live on ya disco
Bangin' on your radio
Guaranteed to blow it up at every show
Get dough, ladies know, baby bro'

[Prodigal Sunn]
Banksta boogie, I lay back, relax, the nookie
Sunzini tons of greeny ones, machinery
Straight from Rock City, hot glocks for 450
Block gritty, y'all snakes wanna see me in death, well come get me
Y'all forget me not, forever stay hot
Never turn pop, burn crop, stain my name in hip-hop
Rise to the tip of the top
Perpendicular base lean supreme in the S.U. vehicular
Y'all can't see my fall, I never fold boy
I struck gold in truck loads, y'all cats suck poles
International, classical
See my face all over the globe
You know..

[Chorus]

[Hook: Prodigal Sunn (J. Wells)]
Yo there's somethin' 'bout the West Coast that I love
(And there's somethin' 'bout the East Coast that I love)
Cushion, cushion, whips on dubs
(I hit the subway like, "Nigga, what up?")

[Prodigal Sunn]
Champion of war, first seed to feed the poor
I'm from the hood baby, nickel 380 clap at the Navy
Perhaps I may be crazy in the platinum Mercedes
Chop the flavor, 8 Timberlands the cover of gravy
Y'all scared to face me, rip grip mics like Horse Gracey
America's Most Wanted on tracks, y'all straight wack
Compensate plaques, dominate battle with steel gats
I make you feel that, curiosity killed the cat
Now where the real at?
All them pill pop and smoke chocka-brocka
A few words to you MC's, "you'll never stop us"
Stay true to The Grain, you know my name
Blew in the game, see us in the Hall of Fame
You know..

[Chorus, followed by Hook]

[Prodigal Sunn]
I play the scene like B.B. King, treat the mic like Lucile
Do what I feel up in the field with two steels
Move with the shield of Sham
From East, West, North, South, the Sunn is on time
Ones on my mind, I'm all about my family
S-U-N-Z, W-U T-A-N-G C-L-A-N
Say it again, we made men
From the cradle or the alley
Rock Balley Louie Gucci sock
I'm from a block where shells pop, we tell not
Inhale crop, fuck cops, they wanna see us drop
The only thing droppin' be my L.P.
Introducin' the great Sunzini..</pre>
