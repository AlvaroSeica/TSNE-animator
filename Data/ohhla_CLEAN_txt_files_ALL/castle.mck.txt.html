Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Unicorns and wizard sleeves
Hammer pants and make believe
Pirate ships sailing off to sea
Well, you can party with me in my castle
in my castle, in my castle, in my castle

This is for the freaks and for my magicians
Booty clap and lap dancing technicians
Dance parties in the name of Great Britain
And American girls who love the Detroit Piston
Like Dennis Rodman, I got a rod, man (awww yeah!)
Long wong-dong in a soft hand
And a ping-pong pink schlong, let's all dance!

From England to Stockholm
I'm wearing a cape just like a poncho
I got a cutey and I'm making a beat on her booty
Like I was up on the roof beating up on a bongo

I got a bottle of Martinelli's
and dumping it all over anybody that's kicking it in the Grotto
And the neighbours keep tripping, I'm like in a castle
Fuck your condo!

Unicorns and wizard sleeves
Hammer pants and make believe
Pirate ships sailing off to sea

Unicorns and wizard sleeves
Hammer pants and make believe
Pirate ships sailing off to sea
Well, you can party with me in my castle
in my castle, in my castle, in my castle, in my castle

You like to party, I am a party-er
You like to wander, I am a wanderer
Your thighs are the closet to Narnia
Is it cool if I go and get lost in that?

I'm the lion, the witch in the wardrobe
Massaging my lap, I have a sore bone
Of course cold on the dance floor
Like an Eskimo's toes in the North Pole
With those toes poking out of two holes
In the Eskimo socks, I'm hot
Like a cauldron from a warlock
Wearing sweatpants in a sauna
Who's your father? I'm not

I'm motherfuckin' Raven Bowie and here's my cock
Rooster, Cock-a-doodle-doo sir
Take a hit of the hooka, now make it drop

Girl's booty was bigger than the stomach of Rick Ross'
Holy mother mountain of tender tendin' you get lost in
Bounce, bounce, that castle booty, that bottom
Make it wobble, wobbly-wobble 'til my third leg has to hobble

You don't want to look back on this night
And think I should have been freaking on a booty
Freak-freaking on a booty

Unicorns and wizard sleeves
Hammer pants and make believe
Pirate ships sailing off to sea
Well, you can party with me in my castle
in my castle, in my castle, in my castle

This might be the best night that we have ever had
That-that we have ever had
That-that we have ever had
That-that we have ever had together
Eh, motherfucking, eh

Have you ever killed a coyote in the middle of a party
In the night, in the middle of a party
Have you ever killed a coyote in the middle of the night
In the middle of a party
Brought it home and threw it on the carpet
Sit and kill a coyote, I'm starving
Who wants to eat a coyote?
Who wants to eat a coyote?
Who wants to eat a coyote?

Bring my bagpipe, I grab my flute
Cause drunk King John is still the loo
Get onto the pole in a birthday suit, our suit
Where MJ is King, and Prince's pants
And Raven has whatever says

Unicorns and wizard sleeves
Hammer pants and make believe
Pirate ships sailing off to sea
Well, you can party with me in my castle
in my castle, in my castle, in my castle, in my castle</pre>
