[BlackSmif]
The BlackSmif is here I got the Ill-logic
comparin the known paths of micro-scopic
Columbus fell out followin the third object
I'm sick of all this real hot air, I popped it
Exact is, perhaps he's starvin for perfection
That's scientifically known as anaeroxic
Backwards say I'll are those dyslexic
Yo my feet are worn (?) that means I stand corrected
It's there but you don't see it, the +Unforeseen Shadow+
I battle, you'll soon see, how it unravels
So be ready, if you're wack it may be vital
It be across the map because good music travels
The music that I heard started at the sugar shack
on some killer MC raps it was never lookin back
I figured that, he's a writer, and not a back biter
Original sound profound a hyper soul cypher
Cypher to soul, takin lyrics out of control
So searchin was emboldened of reason but we don't fold
Or must I explain, because it's gettin kinda old
I'm gonna stop, and let Illogic gain control</pre>
