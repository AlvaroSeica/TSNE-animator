[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
("I was raised in the hood, the hood, the hood...")
Eastside, Long Beach to be exact
("I was raised in the hood, the hood, the hood...")
Where the grass is greener, and the Crips are much meaner
("We got, we got, we got ya back...") Yeah
("I was raised in the hood, the hood, the hood...")
I'll never turn my back on the hood, yeah
("I was raised in the hood, the hood, the hood...")
You can take me out the hood, but you can't take the hood up outta me
("We got, we got, we got ya back...")

[Snoop Dogg]
Raised by the gangsters, the generals
The thieves, the 20's, yeah them stealin niggaz please
What'chu know about that? I do it everytime
Told 'em 1800, had 'em mixin it with lime
Oohweee! My life is like a movie
I was thuggin in the Beach when I lit my first doobie
In the same city where I got my first piece of coochie
Where I sold my first dime, and I held my first uuuuzi
Bitch choose me, cause I'm goin to the top, rap or the rock
Them hoes say I'm on bitch whenever will it stop?
I was poppin like it's on, slamming Chevy's up the block
East up! What it do though, now I ride two do'
The Porsche lookin mean, I throw up the two-ohhhhh
Hella far from broke, the 40 won't choke
Plus a niggaz still elope, homey cause I was

[Chorus: repeat scratches 2X]
("I was raised in the hood, the hood, the hood...")
("I was raised in the hood, the hood, the hood...")
("We got, we got, we got ya back...")

[Snoop Dogg]
Raised by the monsters, the criminals, the G's
It was plenty of them niggaz on the East
What'chu know 'bout that? Snoopy in his prime, I'm a boss
I catch a nigga slippin like moss
Ride with the realest, I've been on it since a young'un
It's two hundred bitches in the function
Lookin cool, you know it bitch yeah I'm rollin
And I ain't worried about them niggaz we patrollin
The hood and the city, blowin on that dilly
Two mill-y, two Bugattis, call 'em Rozay and Diddy
Heart of the set, homey I'm a vet
Lil' nigga, keep ya clothes, ask around, I'm a rep
East up! What it do though, hoes spillin Nuvo
Doggy on his tip, I threw up the two-ohhhhh
Hella far from broke, the 40 won't choke
Plus a niggaz still elope, homey cause I was

[Chorus]

[Snoop Dogg]
Raised by them hustlers, them dealers on the block
It was plenty of them niggaz on the spot
What'chu know 'bout that? Turned up fully
The hood raised me, gangbangin made me a bully
Ya dig? ... Burnt out
And any party we at, you know it's turned out
The people talkin the rumors now what you heard about?
How I spend a hundred thou' gettin purped out
Blowin~! I'm strapped up
I keep a pistol for these suckers tryin to act up
They know I'm famous like I won't get in the streets cuz
Like I don't come from the W I'm a beast bruh
What it do though? Dickies for the dulo
Homie you know, skinny niggaz sumo
Hella far from broke, the 40 won't choke
Plus a niggaz still elope, homey cause I was

[Chorus]

[Snoop Dogg]
Baby Dubb, Baby Dubb, good lookin cuz!
Yeah, everybody neighborhood
Put your neighborhood in the air
Throw it up one time, yeah</pre>
