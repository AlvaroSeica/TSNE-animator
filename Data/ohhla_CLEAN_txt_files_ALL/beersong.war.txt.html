Typed by: Cno Evil

"Oh yeah, oh-oh yeah" - sample repeated through out the song

[Intro: Warcloud]
The same, yeah, same ol' song
Same song, call it the beer song
Fuckas, the beer song
Same ol' song, same song, call it the beer song
Same ol' song, same song, call it the beer song
Same ol' song, same song, call it the beer song, fuckas
Bud Light, beer, worldwide, for more, beer
This how we rock it, yo

[Chorus 2X: Warcloud]
We all cheer for big bottles of beer
We all cheer for big bottles of beer
Tall cans, short cans, small bottles, clear
We all cheer for big bottles of beer

[Warcloud]
Stone becomes red, yo, champ, we cheer beers
For nine hundred years, robust you, so stand clear
Warcloud, call him the sleepwalker wit phantoms
For old Sam Adams, Budweiser, Miller and Tantrum
Grumpy drunk, lazy and crazy, I'm drunk tomorrow
Drinkin' big grades, I swagger and swipe the cargo
Six packs, twenty four packs and gun powder
I brought two gauge and my gun'll turn you to chowder
Same ol' song, same song, call it the beer song
Got me up in North Long Beach, smokin' a tree in bong
Keep a heavy pistol, hip hop was kinda joggy
Kid, back up off me, I murder you kind of sloppy
I drink crazy beer, big beers in bad bars
From the tap, I squeeze eight mugs and date slugs
Play hugs, as I stumble out late, wit a great bottle
Rev a Harley, squabble, catch coffin straight from Chicago
Model broads love flashy little ones, sip a fiddle one
Pop you wit the gat, snap a brew and watch the dribble run

[Chorus 2X]

[Warcloud]
Same ol' song, same song, call it the beer song
Rice ball it, wheat, and hot, to make the year long
Cigarette fell to the bottom, of the beer can
I use sportsmen steel, faster than ears can
Now they fear man, and Warcloud was great
I smoke a big Dutch, statue at the bottom of Beer Lake
I lick off shots from a crop duster and bet
We'll go beer, sunrise to sunset
Same ol' song, same song, call it the beer song
Rice ball it, wheat, and hot, to make the year long
Cigarette fell to the bottom, of the beer can
I use sportsmen steel, faster than ears can
Now they fear man, and Warcloud was great
I smoke a big Dutch, statue at the bottom of Beer Lake
I lick off shots from a crop duster and bet
We'll go beer, sunrise to sunset
Same ol' song, same song, call it the beer song
Same ol' song, same song, call it the beer song

[Chorus 2X]

[Warcloud]
The dirty bat flies anyway, we love beers
Sip a frosty mug in a row boat, at winter times
Snowy forest days at Christmas and through the year
We all cheer for big bottles of beer
Skarekrow music, your beats the Stevie Wonder
I drag a rapper under, drink Larvae age the whole summer
Thunder mermaid hair in a bottle, at the bar
The attic toy pistol and cotton for a beard
The cheerleaders cheered, blood on the mirrors smeared
My flow is architect tonic and atmosphere
Cold beers, cold cans, cold bottles and kegs
I bust crazy shots at the legs if you square pegs
Whacko wit a stool on your chest, the place bubble
I hustle up a couple of Coors cans and chuggle
I'm laughin' wit the cat, you found my book of witches
I'm at the regal eagle wit the Three's Company bitches
Drink wit the pirates, cruisin' and never steer wrong
Same ol' song, same song, call it the beer song

[Chorus 2X]

[Outro: Warcloud]
Same ol' song, same song, call it the beer song
Same ol' song, same song, call it the beer song
Same ol' song, same song, call it the beer song
Yeah, yeah, yo we drink beers forever
Same ol' song, same song, call it the beer song
Same ol' song, same song, call it the beer song
Same ol' song, same song, call it the beer</pre>
