Song:   Outro About Nothing
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Yea, so yea, how come uh..
Yea, I came in to do the album
Right
I thought we're doing the album today
How come? What happened?
When are we doing that?
Are we still doing that?
Do you wanna do it?
Album about nothing, when are we doing that?
I thought we were doing that
I just wanted to see if I can get you here
I'm here
I came here to do it
I don't really have much for you right now
I don't know what to do
Well when are you gonna have it?
When am I doing it?
I'm ready to do it right now
I wanna do it
I'm not too sure Jerry
Well who is sure? Who is in charge of this
This is Gifted, this is The Gifted session
This isn't album about nothing, this is The Gifted session
Oh this is The Gifted session
Yea, for the album that I got now
Okay
Alright then I guess I'll come back
Please</pre>
