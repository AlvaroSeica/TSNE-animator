[Intro: Shabazz the Disciple]
It's the block, nigga...
It's that Godz Wrath shit
Straight up, no smiling, nigga, no laugh, shit
Word... the saga continues...

[Shabazz the Disciple]
This chick was known for doing smuggles
And tying niggas up in the spot and spraying shots at ya crime huddle
With the nine double, caught a stretch and a nine double
Shifty, give a bitch a buck 50 with the lime bubble
Pimpstress, shorty hustle like a nigga do
Relentless, and she would bust you for the figures too
Come up short, she guaranteed to bring trouble to you
And she did a bid that put her kids in BCW
Her man was doing a long stretch up in the mountains
He put her on to the game and how to stay paper counting
He ran a spot from a phone, behind the wall
The shits was tapped, it won't be long til we fall
The DEA hired an inmate, to set the whole crime ring up
By connecting them to bigger weight
They had 'em copping from these dreads from that nigga crew
A sneaky ass start fucking on them niggas to
She was the wife of a don, the black tatt' a Christ ice on the arm
Shorty stay with a knife and dice in the palm
She put the scum team on, some adolescents
But them little niggas keep burning down blocks and how to stress her
She sent them niggas out of town, one day, yo
To lay low, they fucking up work, the yae yo
She back and forth on flights and transporting
Sending commissary and kites to her man up north and
No more V.I.'s, cuz that's no longer where her heart went
Dread moved to N.Y. and gave her keys to the apartment

[Chorus 2X: Shabazz the Disciple]
You tell me if that game change, or if that life is the same
That young gangstas live their lives in the gang
Young gun sprayers, ending up dead, chasing the life of the bling
And some players get hit with life in the bing

[Shabazz the Disciple]
On the run for years, and finally, they caught the nigga
That muthafucka from the backseat who pulled the trigger
That snake bitch been cut him off, cuz she ain't trust 'em
She sent ATF to that nigga crib to rush him
They chopped an X on his face in population
That nigga ain't know the world he was about to be facing
Soon as he stepped in the yard, my peoples knew him
That one of him got life in the hole, they pushed it through him
It's where the saga get thicker, cuz shorty people found out
It was her, who got him killed in that fucking stick-up
She caught fifty from the grands in the truck
Left my man in a slump, in the black van with her hands on the pump
Her world was spinning fast, her fucking days were numbered
How adviseries were coming to get her ass and who she run with
Four of her mans and a crew, were being followed
By some thugs wearing DEA suits banging hollows
They sprayed thirsty at they ass and then reloaded
Spit again, and hit the gas tank, the car exploded
Left they asses in ashes, three in the morning
Snake bitch better know that she next, that was the warning
The bigger the order, the more the gamble be
Cuz one of them little niggas she sent out of state, was shorty family

[Chorus 2X]

[Shabazz the Disciple]
Dread haunted by the pressure niggas put on her
Sent this gunman to get her that night, sprayed up the corner
But they ain't hit nothing, nope, them niggas scattered
She had that nigga up all night, ready to go at it
Next morning, she heard one of them was in the barber shop
Right around the corner, two lights, from his father block
He ran up in there, that nigga was in the chair
He bust a shot in the air, and put his brains on the fucking mirror
Hopped in the getaway car, with his sons
And fled the scene, and went to melt down the gun
Scoop the chick, and caugh the next flight leaving
Cuz flying to the Islands, is the only way she stay breathing
Soon as he pass through customs with the hottie
Them immigration fuckers rushed him for the body
He got deported and highly go exedited
But she didn't get indicted, had big lawyers to fight it
She took a stand on him, and she betrayed him
Her testimony gave him the max, yo, she played him
Went to his crib in New York, and cleaned his safe
Now she caked, about to take her shit out of state
Her little niggas picked her up, from the airport
She went to the telly, and laid down and cleared her thoughts
But she ain't know her little nigga was out to get her
And he had a plan with shorty fan to pull a trigger
He was patient, waiting for that moment alone
She fell asleep, while he was bagging up work and on the phone
Now if she trust him and need him, he was the one man
That night, he put the pillow over her head but the gun jammed

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
