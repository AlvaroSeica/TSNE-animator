(Intro)
What she looks like (x5)
(stutter-What)she looks like

(Chorus x2)
Well she looks like a moviestar (uh huh!)
Like a chocolate cany bar (mmm good!)
She looks like a moviestar (thats right!)
Like a choclate candy bar (ye yo!)

(Verse 1)
Ay yo! Full blown genetics, body athletic
Your body look good so I gotta give credit
Enough men sweat it cause they all wanna hit it
Cause you got that look like 'y'all come get it'
Short skirt wearinin', diamond earrings'
And no draws on, love to live life darrin'
And don't stop starrin', any party we're in
They got more girlfriends who don't mind sharrin'
Sippin on liquor, watchin my zipper
Wanna tear off my clothes, expose the big dipper (oh oh!)
Here we go, I know this game
Where you don't know my name, don't know why you came
Cause usually you don't ever go to clubs
To give oochie to cats and fake it for love
And its the first time
Yeah my first time too!
Never did this before, please be gentil

(Chorus x2)

(Verse 2)
Yo a, big body girl, diamonds and pearls
Lucious lips, curves, hips, honey dips dangerous
Huggin' on a man, do the wink and kiss
Thats why I can't understand how we so pussy
Whipped and ready to flip and beeped down over that
Cause he can't control his girl, step in the wrong cat
Who don't play that?
And we don't play stucky
Yo, one time we hit, two times she was lucky
A heart felt, she couldn't handle it
She just want to get close and peep my manuscripts
Yo dem pretty chicks watchin', they scandolous
But I can't even knock I'm not a fan of this

(Chorus x2)

(Verse 3)
Yo a, real fine damsel, froma ny angle
Half Cha'day, half Naomi Campbell
Sandles struttin' like she hard to handle
And make a nigga wanna gamble and get a sample of that
Never chocolate, caramel chocolate
Vanilla, and yella and milk choclate
Yo these fellas take like to the darkest
Melt in my hands cause we don't eat chocolate
Dats what they all say but they just talkin'
They rather foreplay, we just hit the target
My only forte is how to make a profit
And bounce wit the gurls dat turn the cold to the tropic

(Chorus x2)

Well she looks like a moviestar....</pre>
