(Hook)
I look at all the lonely people
I look at all the lonely people
Father forgive me...
For I have sinned in a world that is broken and scorned
I should have been warned, nobody tells us
That you will live your whole life just do die, then move on
So why settle for...
All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

(Verse 1)
My God...
Everybody wanna look at me deep in my eyes and see the soul, so I keep 'em closed
I'm the one the Lord himself done chose
To be a stand out and stand alone
Me, myself, and I...
Is what I got in the end
You can put me in the casket or pen.
Probably be a better state than I'm in
But then again, I be watchin from the outside, lookin in
Lookin in from the outside as I remenisce
Wanna give witness to the remembrance
For those who ain't here who'd love to hear this, love to see this, love to feel this
Maybe you wouldn't of felt just how lonely life gets
Maybe you never see just how dark the night gets
Why is the question, the reason....

(Hook)
I look at all the lonely people
I look at all the lonely people
Father forgive me...
But do you know what they scream when they dyin in pain?
They scream your name
The Lord is our Savior
That's what the pastor says every week Sunday in pray
But you're never there
All the lonely people
Where do they all come from
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong

(Verse 2)
Oh Lord...
Will they ever understand us loners?
Us natural hustlers that hug the corners
And plus it feels like the world is closin in on us
Or is it just me? That really know 'em bleed
R-U R-U, L-E L-E
Ain't nothin anybody really can tell me
Done been through what they seen at all lately
I'ma get through it, just bear ya soul with me
Cause it's all crazy, but it's all made me...
Realize the gift that the Lord gave me
Wish I could sometime talk to him and save me
What would I say? I don't know, maybe I'm crazy
Maybe I'm lonely, only because (I)
Was born alone, and die alone (My)
Life is lived to die, to mourn
And for the date, could die tomorrow
That's why...

(Hook)
I look at all the lonely people
I look at all the lonely people
Father forgive me...
But there's a life I must claim, and his life isn't mine
Please send me a sign (Death)
Was the scene of the crime as he lied but his eyes wide and died
And nobody cried...
All the lonely people (I look at all the lonely people)
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people (I look at all the lonely people)
Where do they all belong?</pre>
