All that bullshit's for the birds
You ain't nuttin but a vulture
Ah-ah-ah, always hopin for the worst
Waitin for me to fuck up
You'll regret the day when I find another girl, yeah
That know just what I need, she know just what I mean
When I tell her keep it drama-free
Whoa-ohhh-ohhh-ohhh-ohhh-ohhh-ohhh-ohhh
(Chuck-chuckin up them) Deuces~!
Whoa-ohhh-ohhh-ohhh-ohhh-ohhh-ohhh
Yeahhh - told you that I'm leavin, deuces~!
Whoa-ohhh-ohhh-ohhh-ohhh-ohhh-ohhh-ohhh
Whoa-ohhh..
I know you mad but so what? I wish you best of luck
But now I'm fin' to throw them deuces uuuuup

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I'm on some new shit
I'm chuckin my deuces up to her (deuces!)
I'm movin onto somethin better, better, better
No more tryin to make it work (deuces!)
Make me wanna say, bye-bye, say, bye-bye
Say, bye-bye, to her (deuces!)
Make me wanna say, bye-bye, say, bye-bye
Say, bye-bye, to her

[Tyga]
Uhh, used to be Valentine's, together all the time
Thought it was true love, but you know women lie
It's like I sent my love with a text two times
Called cause I care but I ain't gettin no reply
Tryin to see eye-to-eye but it's like we both blind
Fuck it let's hit the club; I rarely sip but po' me some
Cause when it's all said and done
I ain't gon' be the one that she can always run to
I hate liars, fuck love, I'm tired of tryin
My heart big but it beat quiet..
I don't ever feel like we vibin
Cause every time we alone it's a awkward silence..
So leave your keys on the kitchen counter
And give me back that ruby ring with the big diamond
Shit is over, what you trippin fo'?
I don't wanna have to let you go
But baby, I think it's better if I let you know

[Chorus] w/ ad libs

[Kevin McCall]
Look, my shawty always on some +Bull+ shit like Chicago
So I flip that middle finger and the index finger follow
Deuces, we ain't got no future in tomorrow
I'm a dick, so it shouldn't be that hard to swallow
The other chick I'm with never complainin
She +Make Me Wanna+ leave the one I'm with, Usher Raymond
Probably didn't register, don't trip, later on, it will
Shawty full of +Drama+ like Gangsta, Grizzills
I finally noticed it, it finally hit me
Like Tina did Ike in the limo it finally hit me
I got a new chick, and she ain't you
She Paula Patton thick, she give me +Déjà Vu+
And all that attitude, I don't care about it
But all that shit I do for her, you gon' hear about it
Breezy rep two up, two down
But I'm just puttin two up, chuckin up the deuce now (OHH~!)
