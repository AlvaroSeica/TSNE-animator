Typed by: AZ Lyrics

There's a lot of thick bitches, I like skinny bitches
I like big fat girls
What do you mean?
Don't discrimate on anybody, I like all women
Boy what you talkin bout?
Man I like girls that weight 250 pounds
Plus 400 pounds, even in the middle
I like a skinny ass, you feel me?
70 pounds, 103, fuck it

[Chorus]
Twerk it like that, twerk it like that, twerk it like that
Twerk it like that, twerk it like that, twerk it like that
Twerk it like that, twerk it like that, twerk it like that
Twerk it like that, twerk it like that, twerk it like that
Twerk it like that, twerk it like that, twerk it like that
Twerk it like that, twerk it like that, twerk it like that

Bitch can you shake your ass, like that ass
Fuck it from the back, broke you with the mac
Make your ass drop on the ground like that
Girl what's your name? I'm a tell you like that
Riding round town all day with strap
Girl I like you, bitch what it do
Make it drop if you really want to
Need every girl to twerk your ass like this
Every hoe know, she dance like a hoe
She a good girl but she dance like a hoe
Throwin all this money, bitch I'm a go broke
Make it clang, clang like a real live
Make it based God I never thanked you before
My main bitch, ski mask on
Shaking all that ass bitch I'm fin to go broke
Twerk it for the based God, bitch now you know

[Chorus]
Twerk it like that, twerk it like that, twerk it like that
Twerk it like that, twerk it like that, twerk it like that
Twerk it like that, twerk it like that, twerk it like that
Twerk it like that, twerk it like that, twerk it like that
Twerk it like that, twerk it like that, twerk it like that
Twerk it like that, twerk it like that, twerk it like that

Left hand on your leg, this is cool
Right hand on your leg, hey lady sip on something
Now arch your back, forgive me, forgive me
Now like that, I'm a fuck the bitch

Where the girls, way more girls

Everybody know about batman and robin
Still blow purp, fuck what you heard
Every bitch shake your ass, right to the beat

[Chorus]
