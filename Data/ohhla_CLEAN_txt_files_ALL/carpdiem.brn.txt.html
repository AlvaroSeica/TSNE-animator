Look at me now at 5'9 lil chubby round the waistline, still fine
Neva woulda pictured I'd be spittin scriptured glimpses of images in my mind
Or givin you visual observations of my time
Like livin through pivitol situations and still shining
In line with the one so I could never be two
the way I move its never optional to lose so I pick and choose
the pathways knowing that the past days cant be changed
Take it wit a salt grain
maintain beyond the garbage never harbor ill will when its time to build
Seek the real and represent yaself accordingly cause ordinarily nigga will hate
when your take on life is slightly different they might be wishin to be you.
Gotta be able to see thru the wicked neva taint ya vision
Keep ya mission true thru the nonsense
cause God bless the child that's got his own know ya role and play it

(hook) Life is what you make it nigga
I'ma make it no matter what it takes my nigga I'm gone take it
(Repeat)

the smiles and the daggers I'm among em
neva slumberin on enemies vicious wit envy playin like family
Friends wait for you to win till they begin to show they
true colors doin onto others like they mothers never taught em bout integrity- baffles me still
To this day we cant escape the mentality to battle the mirror than comprehend the bigger picture
We automatically figure
everybody out to get us
If we could just focus on the finer things the minor things cease to exist
I'm no expert but shit
when I'm groveling at the bottom all my problems seem major
But when I change up the mental
everything align simple
Divine signals of the God in me the rhymes the beat
my release to situations when they seem greater than the solution you keep it movin.
Cause sun don't shine forever
let them rainclouds come around

(hook)
aint tryna preach to you
just wanna hit you with the rules and regulations of defying limitations
Patients is virtuous
when the dust clears the tears wash the surface greet the new with a purpose
The worst is behind you
refined so you shine like the summer sky
and hindsight is 20/20 so you got plenty reasons to evolve like the season
Freedom is a mindstate waiting to be believed in
