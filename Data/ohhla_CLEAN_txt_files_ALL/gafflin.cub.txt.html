[J. Dee]
Police eat the dick straight up, you know why?
I got Jacked just the other night
This motherfucker gonna tell me, what I'm doing walk in the streets
Man, what the fuck you mean what I'm doing walk in the streets?
You gonna buy me a motherfuckering car?
Everytime I try to steal one, you take me to jail
So what the fuck you talk about.. a nigga like me struggling to stride?
Nigga walking in the streets at night is like committing suicide
So what the fuck is next?
I'm tired of this motherfucking shit
Niggaz popping off the Mob, talking about I'm the Nigga You Love to Hate
Bitch!! back up off my tip
For the simple fact; you're only like a gnat on a dog's dick...</pre>
