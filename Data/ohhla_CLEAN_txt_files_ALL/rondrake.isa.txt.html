"I mean... I mean I've been thinkin'... heh, nah"
"Ay Rob, this the one, blast me, turn me up"
"You sure?"

[Isaiah Rashad]
So don't call me a nigga, unless you call me "my nigga"
I'm a king, O.E., be slippin', fallin' from my chalice, uh ("alright")
Don't mind the bumpers that be missing from my carriage, uh
It's poorly tinted, but my women not embarrassed ("that's alright")
I came to bury you average, uh, you feel slighted, ay
It's like she know that I got it, it feel like it, ay
I real life it, ay, I spill vices, ay
You will like it, I promise it's trill vibin', I'm honest ("yeah")
Nigga ain't no gettin' money on that conscious shit
I'mma just load my gat on some survival shit
And when I hear they got a drought on it
I take a month out of rap and I hustle 'til I'm out of it ("ohh")
I got that coke flow, that heat rock
I got that old school, huddle 'til the beat box ("ohh")
Baby, I'm just diggin' in your gushy for the sweet spot
I'mma beat that, 'til that mothafuckin' beat drop

[Chorus: SZA + Isaiah Rashad]
I got love for my niggas, my killers, my dealers, my trickers, my - bros
I got love for my sisters, my women, my bitches, my strippers, my - hoes
I got love for my niggas, my killers, my dealers, my trickers, my - bros
I got love for my sisters, my women, my bitches, my strippers, my - hoes
I got love for my niggas

[Isaiah Rashad]
Hope they don't kill you cause you black today
They only feel you when you pass away
The eulogy be so movin', we live the scenes of those movies
Conflicts in school or dope movin', it's so youthful
But if you die today, I hope you find some relief
In what a great escape, we still dodgin' from polices
when we make a plate, they be lyin', searchin' in my bucket
with the straightest face, it could be eighty eight
Sometimes I wonder why we killers, why they killin' us
I think we only wear a grill because they grillin' us
Or how they feelin' us, gotta look real and tough
Gotta keep your hands in the cart, know you stealin' stuff
Came a long way from a boat and an auction
Now we got names and a vote, then a coffin
Ain't shit change but the coast we adopted
Little black children you can call me that nigga, nigga
(-nigga, -nigga, -nigga, -nigga, -nigga, -nigga, -nigga, -NIGGA...)

[Chorus]</pre>
