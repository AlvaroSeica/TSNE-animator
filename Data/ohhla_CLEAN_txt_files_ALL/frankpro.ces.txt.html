[Ceschi with a faux British accent]
You should have married her, when you had the chance
On that Saturday, proposed with that pink plastic ring that came
inside of a box of Safeway Corn Flakes
Deep down in West O
But you, Frank False, could be alone
You won't find friends like that again
Time tends to swell, leaving you dry
In short, you should have married her, when you had the chance
Should have married her, when you had the chance
Should have married her, when you had the chance friend

"Why are there people like Frank? Why is there so much trouble in this world?"</pre>
