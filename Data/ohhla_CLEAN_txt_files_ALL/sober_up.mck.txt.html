Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse]
New to this drinking thing
Mindset on a new plane
Call it jet-ways
I'm wishing you would fly my way

[Chorus 3x]
Wishing you would fly my way

[Verse]
I'm fighting these feelings caged
'cuz they lock me down
As liquor courses my veins
[?] I think I need another drink
I think I need another drink

It's the key to the lock, love
Tell this woman that I fought love
As tears drop, jack shots to heart, love
The burn mends the broken parts, love
Put my pride to the side
Ego my amigo, but this henny's like a prize
Well, it was
I mean, it got me feeling buzzed
But lost touch got me wanting more than it was
So I call back
Bad luck like a black cat
Cadillac, lilac, and some boombap
[?] a nigga off track
You never hit back
And now I'm staring at this phone, screaming "fight back"
And I knew you never would, we ain't on the same drug
Funny that this thing's called love
Its time to sober up
I gotta sober up

[Chorus 4x]
Wishing you would fly my way

[Chorus 4x]
Wishing you would fly my way</pre>
