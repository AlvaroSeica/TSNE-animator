Rob the jewelry store and tell 'em make me a grill
Add the whole top diamond and the bottom row's gold

[J.D.]
Yo we bout to start a epidemic wit this one
Y'all know what this is... So So Def

[Nelly]
Got 30 down at the bottom, 30 mo at the top
All invisible set wit little ice cube blocks
If I could call it a drink, call it a smile on the rocks
If I could call out a price, lets say I call out a lot
I got like platinum and white gold, traditional gold
I'm changin girllz errday, like Jay change clothes
I might be grilled out nicely (oh) In my white tee (oh)
Or on South Beach (oh) in my wife B
V V and studded you can tell when they cut it
ya see my grandmama hate it, but my lil mama love it
cause when I..

[Woman]
Open up ya mouth, ya grill gleamin (say what)

[Nelly]

I wouldn't leave it for nothin only a crazy man would

[Chorus]
Smile fo me daddy

Smile fo me daddy

I want to see your grill
(You wanna see my what)
Ya, ya grill ya, ya, ya grill
(Had a whole top diamonds and the bottom rows gold)

[Paul Wall]
What it do baby
Its the ice man Paul Wall
I got my mouth lookin somethin like a disco ball
I got the diamonds and the ice all hand set
I might cause a cold front if I take a deep breath
My teeth gleaming like I'm chewin on aluminum foil
Smilein showin off my diamonds sippin on some potin oil
I put my money where my mouth is and bought a grill
20 karats 30 stacks let 'em know I'm so fo real
My motivation is from 30 pointers V VS to furniture my mouth
piece simply symbolize obsessed
I got the wrist wear and neck wear dats captivatin
But its what smiles dat got these arms lookin spectatin
My mouth piece simply certified a total package
Open up my mouth and you see more carrots than a salad
My teeth are mind blowin givin everybody chillz
Call me George Foreman cause I'm sellin everybody grillz

[Chorus]
Smile fo me daddy
(What you lookin at)
Let me see ya grill
(Let me see my what)
Ya, ya grill ya, ya, ya grill
(Rob the jewelry store and tell 'em make me a grill)
Smile fo me daddy
(What you lookin at)
I want to see your grill
(You wanna see my what)
Ya, ya grill ya, ya, ya grill
(Had a whole top diamonds and the bottom rows gold)

[Gipp]

Lights gon head and make you woozie in ya head
You can catch me in my 2 short drop
Mob got colors like a fruit loop box

[Ali]
Dis what it do when the lou
Ice grill country grammer
Where the hustlas move bricks
and the gangsta's bang hamma's
Where I got 'em you can spot them
On the top in the bottom
Gotta bill in my mouth like I'm Hillary Rodham

[Gipp]
I ain't dissin no body but lets bring it to the lite
Yeah was the first wit my mouth bright white
Yeah deez hos can't focus cause they eyesight blurry
Tippin on some 4's you can see my mouth jewelry

[Ali]
I got fo different sets its a fabolous thang
1 white, 1 yellow, like fabolous chain
and the otha set is same got my name in the mold
(Had a whole top diamonds and the bottom row's gold)

[Chorus]

[Woman]
Boy how you get grill that way and
How much did you pay
Every time I see you
