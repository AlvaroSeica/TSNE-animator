Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro]
God Forgives I don't, Gold
MMG Tour, Leave the money on the scale
How real is dat?

[Verse 1]
It's Been a minute since I been to church
Psalm 27 can I spit a verse
Preyin on the weak, I should send some flowers
I'm layin in the sheets, I'm well endowed
Time to get the money steve forbes got
I'm slowly climbing up, delete your spot
Net worth nigga hoes love to google me
Heavy Jewlery, swimmin trunks on Laguna beach
Condo on Park Ave, The mansion in Boca
20 bedrooms, My shit beiiger den oprahs
Dreams and Nightmares Yeah I'm still havin those
Side effects for niggas livin like animals
Tequila Cup, Cake for a Kingpin
Black Bar Mitzfah niggas ain't seen shit
Obama Fundraiser, All Dope boys
Blow ya candle out so on and so forth
Boyz in da Hood, nigga game ain't change
I done made love wearin eight chains
Step to my enemies, tattoo all of my memories
Use the Project ground for my assemblies
I respect the tenant, don't step on my tennis
Follow chain and command, Gunplay my lieutenant

[Chorus]
They ask me what I do and who I do it for
And how I come up with the shit up in the studio
All I want for my birthday is a big booty ho
All I want for my birthday is a big booty ho
When I die bury me inside the Gucci store
When I die bury me inside the Louis store
All I want for my birthday is a big booty ho
All I want for my birthday is a big booty ho

[Verse 2]
She got a big booty so I call him big booty
West movie, couldn't get into it
I'm in the kitchen, yea I'm's everywhere
Jamaya juice, I got bands everywhere
You the realest nigga breathin if I hold my breath
Referee with a whistle, hold his tat
Extendo clip (Extendo clip)
Extendo roll (Extendo roll)
When your girl lead mission at your house alone
Hell we killin, goin on a chopathon
See I don't have my balls in Pakistan
Dope bomb, Joe Bomb and I peel bomb
See nigga I've been balling you in real Kong
When I die bury me inside the jewelry store
When I die bury me inside the jewelry store
True to my religion, to everything I'm too different
So when I die bury me next to 2 bitches

[Chorus]
They ask me what I do and who I do it for
And how I come up with the shit up in the studio
All I want for my birthday is a big booty ho
All I want for my birthday is a big booty ho
When I die bury me inside the Gucci store
When I die bury me inside the Louis store
All I want for my birthday is a big booty ho
All I want for my birthday is a big booty ho

[Verse 3]
Ahhh easy easy how you do it hah
It's my birthday, I deserve to be greedy hah
She holding out, she ain't give it to the needy hah
You go down stairs and fall asleep with your TV on
Drop in the other 10 years, you deserve a menage
Specially if you put that BMW in er garage
Specially if you made a couple beemers on her mama crib
Went to her niece's graduation, man I hate those kids
Last birthday she got you a new sweater
Put it on, give her a kiss and tell er do better
She said how bout I get you jewelry from the west in?
How bout she hit he west in and get a best friend?
I'm jokin, I'm just serious, I asked er
Don't be actin like no actress
If we preach it then we practice
Don't be reachin, don't be touchin shit
We in Kanye West Benz cause our wheel turn you back, you a pedestrian

[Chorus]
They ask me what I do and who I do it for
And how I come up with the shit up in the studio
All I want for my birthday is a big booty ho
All I want for my birthday is a big booty ho
When I die bury me inside the Gucci store
When I die bury me inside the Louis store
All I want for my birthday is a big booty ho
All I want for my birthday is a big booty ho

It's your birthday, it's your birthday
Bad bitch contest, you win first place
You win first place, you win first place
Bad bitch contest, you win first place

I show up with a check to your work place
Then hand he valet the keys to the Merces
Tell the DJ play your song, this should come up uh
When I'm seein from the back I can't front er on
They ask me what I do and who I do it for
When I die bury me inside the booty club
Get it good, get it good, get it get it good
I might switch it up and get your girl

[Chorus]
They ask me what I do and who I do it for
And how I come up with the shit up in the studio
All I want for my birthday is a big booty ho
All I want for my birthday is a big booty ho
When I die bury me inside the Gucci store
When I die bury me inside the Louis store
All I want for my birthday is a big booty ho
All I want for my birthday is a big booty ho

Deucy yay
We like Snoop and Dre
And this your birthday baby
You deserve a coup that drag

You win first place, you win first place
Bad bitch contest, you win first place</pre>
