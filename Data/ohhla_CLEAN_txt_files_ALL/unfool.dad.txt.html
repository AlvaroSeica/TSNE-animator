[Chorus: Ashanti and (Notorious B.I.G.) ]
See, my days are cold without you (Here's another one)
But I'm hurtin' while I'm with you (And another one)
And though my heart can't take no more
I can't keep runnin' back to you

See, my days are cold without you (Here's another one)
But I'm hurtin' while I'm with you (And another one)
And though my heart can't take no more (Uh)
I can't keep runnin' back to you (Uh, uh, uh)
(Here's another one, what)

[Ashanti]
I think about my strength to finally get up and leave
No more broken heart for me
No more tellin' your lies to me (And another one)
I'm lookin' like I got my head on right, so now I see
No more givin' you everything
There's no more takin' my love from me

[Chorus]

[Ashanti]
I'm glad to wake up every day without you on my brain (Uh)
No more where you're laid up at night
No more havin' to fuss and fight
I'm proud to say (And another one)
That I will never make (And another one) the same mistake
No more thinkin' bout what you do
There's no more me runnin' back to you

[Chorus]

[Notorious B.I.G.]
Some say the X, make the sex
Spec-tacular, make me lick you from ya neck
To yo back, then ya, shiverin', tongue deliverin'
Chills up that spine, that ass is mine
Skip the wine and the candlelight, no Cristal tonight
If it's alright with you, we fuckin' (That's cool)
Deja vu, the blunts sparked, finger fuckin' in the park
Pissy off Bacardi Dark
Remember when I used to play between yo legs
You begged for me to stop because you know where it would head
Straight to yo mother's bed
At the Mariott, we be lucky if we find a spot
Next to yo sister, damn I really missed the
Way she used to rub my back, when I hit that
Way she used to giggle when yo ass would wiggle
Now I know you used to suites at the Parker Meridian
Trips to the Carribean, but tonight, no ends

[Ashanti]
You must be used to me cryin', cryin'
While you're out bumpin' and grindin' (And another one)
But I'm leavin' you tonight

See, my days are cold without you
But I'm hurtin' while I'm with you
And though my heart can't take no more
I can't keep running back to you

You must be used to me cryin', cryin' (Uh, and another one)
While you're out bumpin' and grindin'
But I'm leavin' you tonight (Uh, and another one)</pre>
