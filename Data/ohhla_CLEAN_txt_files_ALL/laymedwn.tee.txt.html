[Intro: Rico Love]
She love me up and lay me down {*3X*}
She get me up, I love it when she lay me down
"Do it baby, stick it baby" - down {*2X*}
"Do it baby, stick it, I stick it baby girl" - down
"Do it baby, stick it baby" - down {*2X*}
"Do it baby, stick it, I stick it baby girl" - down

[T.I.]
I said, get right, girl you know what I got
Got 'em fixin up they make-up when I walk up in the spot
Got they, eye shadow and they lips on shine
With a smile on her face when her lips on mine
See I'm, a big freak, feed her big pita (pita)
Beat that pussy up so good she don't want me to eat her
First I meet her then I feed her (feed her) whatever she need
A few of these, turn a nigga wifey to a cheater
Keep her, head down and her ass up here
Got her hair fucked up, and her lipstick smeared
Take a city bitch here or a bitch from the boonies
With her man at the crib but he don't know what he doin
Hold up - truthfully she knew she'd do me but she knew me
Introduce me and she blew me then she didn't say nothin to me
You don't like it then sue me, she my biggest fan now
When I spend a day in town and she hurry up and lay me DOWN, down

[Chorus: Rico Love] + (T.I.)
She love me up and lay me down (ay what she do?)
She love me up and lay me down (ay what she do?)
She love me up and lay me down (yeah, yeah, yeah)
She get me up, I love it when she lay me down
"Do it baby, stick it baby" - down {*2X*}
"Do it baby, stick it, I stick it baby girl" - down
"Do it baby, stick it baby" - down {*2X*}
"Do it baby, stick it, I stick it baby girl" - down (ay, ay, ay shorty)

[T.I.]
On the hush hush, keep it low key
Attitude in check cause you wit a O.G.
Got that thang on lock, wanna see the do' key?
Got dope dick, give it to her 'til she O-D
I'ma, put it in her life, give her what she missin
She yo' wife well she off limits, well that is unless you slippin
And I catch her on a mission in my hotel lobby
Tryin to run into somebody, end up at the afterparty
With a, stripper body, itty bitty waist
Big ol' booty beggin me to decorate her pretty face
Hey (okay) what can I say? She request and I deliver
Broad lookin for that rod, shorty I'm that nigga
Ain't playin wit'cha, full of RÃ©my, high or sober
You catch me in yo' city, look me up I'll bend you over
Know the, women want me and niggaz think it's the money
But she should be payin me though, it's the dick she gettin from me
From me, all in yo' tummy when she

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Pop that thing girl
Pop, pop, pop that thing girl
I stick it baby girl (go 'head and)
Pop that thing girl
Pop, pop, pop that thing girl (hold up)
Turn the lights on...</pre>
