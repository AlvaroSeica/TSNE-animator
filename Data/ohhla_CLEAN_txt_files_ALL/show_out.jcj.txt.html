[Chorus: Young Jeezy]
Everytime I go out, you know I gotta show out
Everytime I go out (go out), you know I bring the dough out (yeeeeah)
Everytime they go out, you know they bring they ho out (AY)
Everytime I go out (go out), you know I bring that flow out (that's right~!)
Everytime I go out, you know I gotta show out (what)
Everytime I go out, you know I gotta show out (CHEA)
Everytime I go out, you know I gotta show out (what)
Everytime I go out, you know I gotta show out (let's go)

[Juicy J]
Hm-mmm, hm-mmm, yeah.. we gettin' it
Trippy niggas and a few hoes (mm): one night, two shows (mm)
That's two mansions and a team expansion (mm), thumbin' through a check, got me sweatin and pantin' (mm)
When you getting money chicks come around (mm), niggas start hatin' who's holdin' you down (mm)
All this ice I'm just livin the life; bad bitches want me, give me head like lice (ho!)
Hit club LIV in a rush (yeah), pockets so swole I think they finna bust (yup)
Ace in my hand and a .45 tuck (yup), money coming down codeine pourin up (uh-huh)
Smokin on some dope (uh), always on a float (yeah), 20 years in niggas callin me the G.O.A.T (what)
Money adding up you haters going broke (broke), still in the game while you niggas ridin' oak (the bench)
See me showin out; they muggin I don't give a fuck
How I start my morning off a zip and a DOUBLE CUP..
Hatin' ass niggas, y'all behind me, ball so hard they want to find me
Juicy J, Taylor Gang: I been rich since the 90's

[Chorus]

[Big Sean]
Whoa.. boi, boi, boi, boi, boi
Yup, yup, freaky.. freaky freaky
God.. Juicy whattup doe? B-I-G, G.O.O.D

All these ratchet hoes say I ain't shit
Well, at least I ain't broke ho
Stackin paper like old folks
You-you-and you still stayin with your old folks
She a fan, that's fantastic, poppin' xanies, that's xantastic (yup)
Gettin rich, band-tastic (boi), white girls like Anne Hatha (boi)
way going, way out, they wait for my bandwagon (yup)
She let me bang and I ain't got a bandana
Ooh (freaky), that's just how I move
Fast girls, fast money, no more, fast food
Came up, first class, my passport gettin tattooed (boi)
Young ass playa doing everything that I have to
So everytime I go out, you know I...

[Chorus]

[Young Jeezy]
I-I-I-I-I got some bad bitches with me
Say they like Rihanna love Whitney
She say how many bottles do you want, I told her 50
She say anything, yeah bitch a kidney (haha)
Everytime I go out, you know I bring that dough out
Finesse is on a milli, it lookin like a blowout (daaamn)
100 bitches with me, look like I left the ho house (whoo)
100 racks with me, look like I left the blow house (yeeeeah)
N-N-Now we poppin bottles, they came with the sparkles (AY)
Got my niggas with me, they came with them yopper (that's right)
Got a few ratchets (ratchets), even a couple models (models)
20 car caravan, I bet they gon follow, hah
