[Pitbull]
J-Lo!
Ya tu sabe, oy ma ma
(It's a new generation)
Mr. Worldwide (of party people)
Get on the floor, dale!
Get on the floor - RedOne!

[Jennifer Lopez]
Let me introduce you, to my party people, in the club..

[Pitbull]
I'm loose
And everybody knows I get off the train
Baby, it's the truth
I'm like Inception, I play with your brain
So don't sleep or snooze
I don't play no games so d-d-d-don't get it confused, no
'Cause you will lose, yeah
Now p-p-p-pump it up
And back it up like a Tonka truck, dale

[Jennifer Lopez]
If you go hard you gotta get on the floor
If you're a party freak then step on the floor
If you're an animal then tear up the floor
Break a sweat on the floor yeah we work on the floor
Don't stop, keep it movin, put your drinks up
Pick your body up and drop it on the floor
Let the rhythm change your world on the floor
You know we're runnin shit tonight on the floor
Brazil, Morocco, London to Ibiza
Straight to L.A., New York, Vegas to Africa

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
Dance the night away, live your life and stay young on the floor
Dance the night away, grab somebody, drink a little more
La la la la, la la la la la la la la la
Tonight we gon' be it on the floor
La la la la, la la la la la la la la la
Tonight we gon' be it on the floor

[Jennifer Lopez]
I know you got it clap your hands on the floor
And keep on rockin, rock it up on the floor
If you're a criminal, kill it on the floor
Steal it quick on the floor - on the floor
Don't stop, keep it moving, put your drinks up
It's getting ill, it's getting sick on the floor
We never quit, we never rest on the floor
If I ain't wrong we'll probably die on the floor
Brazil, Morocco, London to Ibiza
Straight to L.A., New York, Vegas to Africa

[Chorus]

[Pitbull]
That ba-donka-donk is like a trunk full of bass
on an old school Chevy, seven-trey donka truck
All I need is some vodka and some chunky crunk
and watch a nigga get Donkey Kong
Baby if you're ready for thangs to get heavy
I get on the floor and act a fool if you let me (dale)
Don't believe me just bet me
My name ain't +Keith+ but I see why you +Sweat+ me
L.A., Miami, New York - say no more, get on the floor

[Outro: repeat 3X]
La la la la, la la la la la la la la la
Tonight we gon' be it on the floor</pre>
