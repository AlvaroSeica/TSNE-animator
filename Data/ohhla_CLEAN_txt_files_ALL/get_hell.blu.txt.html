[Intro: Blue Raspberry]
Get the fuck out, get to muthafuckin' steppin'

[Blue Raspberry]
What made you think that I, got the time to be
Waiting on you, that's not cool
Me trippin' over you, from even though, into you
Things that's changed, don't feel the same
And you know the things to do
To make me give into you
But not this time, I'mma get you off my mind
This is how it's going down

[Chorus: Blue Raspberry]
Why, go on, go on, go on
Get the hell on...
Why you trying make me catch a thing
If you don't stay the hell up out my thing
Why, go on, go on, go on
Get the hell on...
I'm tired of you singing that same song
When you keep holding, cuz I will be gone

[Blue Raspberry]
You leave home without a word, not even a goodbye
And staying out all night, coming back with lies
How many excuses can you make, how much shit can this woman take
You're playing around with my feelings, and boy that was a big mistake
I can see straight through your lies
The truth it shall be told, through the windows of your soul
I'm tired, cuz this shit is getting old

[Chorus]</pre>
