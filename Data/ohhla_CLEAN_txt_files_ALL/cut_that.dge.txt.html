Song:   Cut That Zero
Typed by: jhsantos @sol.com.br

Come on baby why you cryin'?He hit you?
Who done it?Your boyfriend?
That chicken McNugget?
That Box Head kd that don't know how to act?
Instead os that Chicken McNugget,you know what you need?
You know what you need baby?
You need a value pack.....

So won't you cut that zero
Get with this hero
Just say yes I don't want to hear no no's
'Cause that's not the way it goes
And I'll take you to every Get Fresh show

I'll greet you like are supposed to be greeted
Treat you like you supposed to be treated
Hold you tight when I know that you need it
And I would never act conceited
Even if I drove a brand new car
And ate high priced food like caviar
I would stay the same and never change my name
Or put you through those  love sick games
Because a woman like you is hard to find
Not just in the body also in the mind
We fit together like pants and a pocket
When we make love its like a plug in a socket
Pushing more power than a thousand volts
And if you fall in love it ain't my falt so baby....

(chorus)(x2)
Cut that zero
And get with this hero
Just say yes I don't want to hear no no's
'Cause that's not the way it goes
And I'll take you to every Get Fresh show
Ho,ho,ho baby,baby

Well I like me a girl that makes me laugh
And wash my back when I'm taking a bath
And massage my shoulders when thay hurt
And at night go to sleep in my tee shirt
And have our pictures hangun' on the walls
And a room full of "I love you" dolls
And be there when I get that feelin for some
"Sexual healin"


(chorus)(x2)


Now when I'm with a girl I'm very direct
And she knows of hand that I need respect
And I could tell by her eyes when she needs love
That's when I put up E.Fresh and just be Doug
And treat you gentle,physical and mental
No love we share will be experimental
Your lips on me
My arms around you
Ain't nothing in the world that we can't do
Now a movie is groovie,a date is great
But a real good time only lasts past eight
And it's fun when I'm chillin' with you
And I could never throw away what we've been through
And what I think I'm really tryin' to say is
What I think I'm really tryin' to say is
What I think I'm really tryin' to say is
I'm with you all the way
