Who that comin' gunnin' flizi comin' gunnin' (start runnin')
Who that comin' gunnin' flizi comin' gunnin' (start runnin')
Who that comin' gunnin' flizi comin' gunnin' (start runnin')
Who that comin' gunnin' flizi comin' gunnin' (ohhhh you better start runnin')

Who that comin' gunnin' flizi comin' gunnin' feel the vibe
Deep off in my chest where buddah rest the vocal uzi lies
Loaded and im holding it and aiming every single shot
Blasting much to fast for you to run so its just pop then drop
Flopping on the concrete in the strizeet in a bloody puddle
With no one to cuddle with ya but the dudy devil sucka
Everything fly say is smooth, even when fly wild and rude
Dont you lose your cool and busters bet not catch an attitude
Stop the balling scalling our ya squealing like a wounded pig
Causing mess goin cause your rest and you must lay before fly quit
After Frank Fly chicken sticka handling ebbin buisness man
Who been stumbling boulders right on over with my cunnin' game
Neglegence of ignorence, mista be afraid of this
What you do not know can certainly cost you fore its over with
Pay me some attention close, as you flex and flodge and boast
Who that comin' gunnin' flizi comin' and I told you so

Who that comin' gunnin' flizi comin' gunnin' (start runnin')
Who that comin' gunnin' flizi comin' gunnin' (you better start runnin')
Who that comin' gunnin' flizi comin' gunnin' (start runnin')
Who that comin' gunnin' flizi comin' gunnin' (you better start runnin')

I bump on hipocrits
I bump on trizicks
I come to get this
I run this shop non stop to the top and droppin' all this bullshit
I twizist to certain music so versitizal
My style from wild to mild to funk all laying if fly pizow
Not counterfeit nor falsefied but often fly been critizied
By bustas who know not nothing bout Mr.flizi
Your gossip, you need to stop it, fly think you sanctified
Young trizick, this aint your pulpit, I cant be crucified
Just bumpin', and keep them comin', from ebbin's dungeon
And something, is better than nothing, so dont be lunching
The senery, is full of greenery, and fly got access
In Minne May and opportunity to test this process
So bless me, and dont you test me, or you'll be restin'
Fly rizight, you comin' wrizong, so fly correct it
Respect me, or get ejected, from playa's gizame
Young mizan, fly comin' gunnin', and take your chump change

Who that comin' gunnin' flizi comin' gunnin' (start runnin')
Who that comin' gunnin' flizi comin' gunnin' (you better start runnin')
Who that comin' gunnin' flizi comin' gunnin' (start runnin')
Who that comin' gunnin' flizi comin' gunnin' (you better start runnin')

Fly speak this gladly
Fly speak this fastly
Fly speak this lastly
Im dope and, and speakin' potent, lyrics so nasty
Yes rocking, and tear up assholes and scar up elbows
Of all those, who do not rizow this way fly gizo
So let me, move naunchalauntly, and cheef my blizunt
And then some, fly in yo chizest and hear you grizunt
An icon, of number wizone, and here I cizome
Right at ya, and come to get ya, aint no illusion
Confusion, you sir can keep it, cause its not needed
Won't stop me, I'm locked on target, so you defeated
Remorsement, and fly will shortly, close up your playground
Preschool you, then over rule you, round after rizound
Its over with its finished fly start it fly ended it
Fly take the cake and ate it and had ice cream with it
And I'm not the biggest nor baddest but realist
BIZUMPIN' CIZOMIN' GIZUNNIN' SO FEEL THIS

Who that comin' gunnin' flizi comin' gunnin' (start runnin')
Who that comin' gunnin' flizi comin' gunnin' (you better start runnin')
Who that comin' gunnin' flizi comin' gunnin' (start runnin')
Who that comin' gunnin' flizi comin' gunnin' (whooa you better start runnin')
Who that comin' gunnin' flizi comin' gunnin'
