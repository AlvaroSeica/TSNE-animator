[Intro]
Yeah, oooh, yeah

[Chorus]
Pr-pr-pretty green bud, all in my, blunt
Ohhhhh I need it
We can take off, now
Ohhhhh marijuana... yeah
Pr-pr-pretty green bud, all in my, blunt
Ohhhhh I need it
We can take off, now
Ohhhhh marijuana... smoke

[Kid Cudi]
I-I, I be on it all day like my nigga Big Boi said
That's the only thing that keep me level up in my crazy head
Stoned on the run run, no fun if not it's Scotty from the hatemail read
Man I swear to keep it one hundred, if I ain't have it then I'd be dead
My soul's been fed tonight, everything that I choose
Still can't forget Grey Goose
Converse covered with mixer juice
And all my niggaz rollin up in the booth
Who got me on another one
Someone please roll me another one
They tell me all good things must end
But those motherfuckers ain't have this friend, my

[Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Kid Cudi]
Always had my back, hey {*3X*}
Always had my back, yeah
Always had my back, yeah
Always had my back, hey! {*2X*}
Marijuana had my back, my back

Oooh! Ohh-oh-oh-oh-whoa
Never left me lonely
It's gonna be okay
Trust me, it's gonna be okay
Ohh, oh-oh-oh
