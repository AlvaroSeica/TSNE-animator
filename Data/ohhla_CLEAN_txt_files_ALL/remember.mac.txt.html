(Yea, yea, yea)

[Verse 1]
I hope you're proud of me
Dude I grew to be
Ingenuity influenced by your eulogy
Going through memories
Like they were movies scenes
I know I've been the shit
All these people full of me
Are you made of
I guess I'm fooling myself too
There's just a bunch of shit
I wish I could tell you, but
This life move fast, I never knew that
Yours wouldn't have lasted
The dirt hitting your casket, like raindrops
I swear I'll let you know when the pain stops
For now I need to run to to any place that the train stops
And everybody wanna talk to me about some business shit
Never really listening, couldn't get real interested
My days get darker, so the haze get sparked up
All this hate, sound the same when my name get brought up
You had a girl, I kinda wish you knocked her up
So I could meet your son and talk you up (Talk you up)

[Chorus]
I remember when we were just kids
We knew nothing at all,
We'd talk about the life we lived
In West Virginia,
Lost somewhere out in
West Virginia

[Verse 2]
It's a dark science, when your friends start dying
Like how could he go, he was part lion
Life goes on, tears all dried in
Couple years are goin' by, by then
Can you please help me find my friend
I'll give you anything you need multiplied by ten
I heard he moved to a place where the time don't answer
You don't need money, all you got is time to spend
Life is short, don't ever question the length
It's cool to cry, don't ever question your strength
I recommend no limits, intricate thought, go 'head just give it a shot
You'll remember shit you've forgot

[Bridge]
Cause way back then I didn't know shit
And I don't know shit now
And when the world's looking hopeless
I'ma still hold shit down

[Chorus]
I remember when we were just kids
We knew nothing at all,
We'd talk about the life we lived
In West Virginia,
Lost somewhere out in
West Virginia</pre>
