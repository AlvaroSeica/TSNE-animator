Intro: P.R. Terrorist

I do, I know, I know what time it is
Terrorist, The Bastard Swordsman
Holocaust, yo, yo

[P.R. Terrorist]
Rap diligently, return of the arm
the star trilogy, scars and injuries inflicted on my enemies
Attack you mentally, draw up and stand just like a centipede
Then strike fast, leave ya weak ass up in a sling
in the infirmary, telling war stories like you was king up
in my rainforest, yet the God rain the hardest
Flame and fury, torch off ya skin tissue and cartilage
Throw darts the sharpest, aimed at ya head, ya man parted
Looking retarded, telling him you never should've started 
what you couldn't end, handled my friend since age 10
But he's not my brother, though he helped me out up in da deep cover
when shit got hot, all palms sweating on the rubber

[Holocaust]
Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang yo

Chorus: P.R. Terrorist (Holocaust)

Bastard Swordsman, swing yo shit
(I'm duckin all of em
Swingin back, double edged axe we cuttin all of em)
*repeat 2x*

[Holocaust]
Inflicted with a rare disease, MC's flee
Fought wars for centuries my wounds bled killer bees
Roam the battlesight word, shatter mics I've had a tragic life
blood splatter nice ghetto life live on a sattelite
Blind, injected with venom from water moccasins
the child who floated in the air lock without oxygen
For seventeen years all I learned was profanity
Graduated from the academy of insanity
Holocaust, loud mouth who roams wise
I'm hideous glancing gouge out ya own eyes
West Coast that grotesque group flow's wet
Bury you and some in Norweiga wit a broke neck
Wu-Tang, seven death blows 
explore the globe,
Stand in shallow water and slaughter those who oppose
The passionate destroyer who stings like antiseptic
Barbaric, esoteric, half-sorcerer, half-skeptic
Anorexic, war machine, 
depressed, drunken mess
Learn from the best, snatchin ya fossil from ya flesh
Bloodshot, Doctor Killgrave, subterranian
Skeleton's reinforced with stone and titanium
Gyros, hun blood and oil flow as one
Mental powers override iron fist and blade tongue
The Bronx Don, with bomb songs, hit Hong Kong
Holocaust is scientific experiment gone wrong

[9th Prince]
Yo, Ally Commanders come dress to kill
at the Armageddon Wedding
We're the old temple platoon ya die soon
Our battlegrounds in the womb of the moon
Most of yall niggas is cloons
gettin hit by typhoons, machine guillotines
Rip out the spleens, tonight while ya screams
I'll blast ya in ya dreams, listen to my bombs
Like you used to read the Psalms
I got firearm like Megatron, asthma attack rap
snaps, windpipes crack,
Bury ya ass beneath the graveyard shack
Third eyes like binoculars, visions of the lyrical opera
Sponsor the conquer, I blow spots like the Unabomber
The stage is made of steel cage, battlegrounds of
Starrcade '98, I meditate at a rate that'll cause an earthquake
I drop antrax bombs on your plantation,
then murder you twice, to make sure there's no reincarnation

Chorus: Killa Sin (Shogun Assasson) 2x

Bastard Swordsman, swing yo shit
(I'm duckin all of em,
Coming back, double edged sword 
and cuttin all of em)

[Shogun Assasson]
My mind is bad, because it's great to see that full
My old dad, and charter his story
And made him believe in a my-story
That's how you know times is bad
When Gods is being killed by crabs
that invest these streets, it ain't safe no more
So before you leave your front door the war is cold
So grab your heats, your God-U now
and your teflon cause the war's on like 
Red Dawn, I'm a threat to America like Saddam
I be the verbal terrorist doing the strength of his language
Now I'm mad like Max, when I attack tracks
To the death of Wu wax, I drop facts like
bombs on Saigon, it be the music that makes me sick
And act like a paranoid schizophrenic,
I leave your mind in a state of panic,
like a claustrophobic trapped on the Titanic

(Chorus: 3x)

Outro: Shogun Assasson

Mother fuckas
Comin straight for ya jugular vein
With my double edged blade</pre>
