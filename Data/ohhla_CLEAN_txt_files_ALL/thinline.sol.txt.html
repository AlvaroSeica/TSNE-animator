[Chorus: Solomon Childs]
This be a story about a man and his wife
Things don't always go the way you plan in life
Thought he was living trife, she kept sharp as a knife
Things don't always go the way you plan in life

[Solomon Childs]
Knowledge knowledge, story of the decade
Deeper than po-nine rushing on a raid, do a federal barricade
Anyway, calmanize story bout Barkim and Jade
Top grade, four aces, Barkim into illegal horse races
Faces trials in down south drug cases
The improper knowledge and briefcases
Short and light skinned with braces
You calm him ice mug, pretty thug running with a rug on the Island
Shines and lines profiling, rare like a terror back in the murder maude nine era
Jade two kids, the quiet type, never hype, like to stare at the stars at night
And write, fairytale books, Barkim would study with the next juk
And from the looks, he had a team of qualified crooks
Abused Jade cuz he couldn't cope really, cocaine mix the weed that
laced his Philly
Less funds for his kids but loved to place big willie
This kid a real snake, and that's what Jade would hate
Haunted a mind with the options, a A.C.F., for early adoptions
He put her through hard circumstances, black blue rugers and puma
apparrels at the dances
Jade's beautiful and all, some dudes would come strong
And Barkim, knew the abuse wouldn't last for long
The newspapers ain't give much detail
How Barkim hugged her tight, as they died in front of a trainrail
True story, this is far from fairytale
And it's bad as it sounds, I guess life is life
And things don't always go the way you plan in life...
Speak on it, God...

[Chorus 2X]

[Solomon Childs]
Story moral's poverty, immortal like a sierra queen
And king, mistake the real off of diamond ring
Better loving then creating beautiful things
My mother earth lose focus, is the weaker pretend
They masters, impostors playing the roll of pastors
In tradition, girls raised better with moms, just
With thoughts of black girls being lost
Who knew we open our eyes and see for what it's worth
Queens the earth, rhinestones, diamonds flooded with your purse
Ancestors grew up with gold, so it's the African curse, and to my young sisters
Walk the other way, if you feel the reaper
Cuz it don't gotta be about twenty inch rims and cheeba
You ain't gotta be a jezebel, you can reign like Caesar
Run a kingdom like bad cheeba, whatever it takes
Whatever it matters, you maintain and collect your cheddar...
Baby girl... collect your cheddar..
Straight pimping ma....</pre>
