Verse

Ferrogamo serenade *your mama*
Cyrano, here we go Â– *pharoah with the ammo yo*
Black mamba marinating in drama
Praying mantis with weapons steady *blazing the lamas*
Amadeus with *Amsterdams flavas*
More cheddar to get/ grands *for the taken*
*Who the fuck you think you trying to be*
You ain't fly, you a fly to me/ *don't lie to me*
*Drinking with*/  whiskey in my *bladder*
Come to the table/  *360 deals on the platter*
I feel like a *batter*
Slugging all the *bullshit you pitching*
Loading full clips in the *kitchen*
Make ya ass do a *full flip like a gymnast*
*Call a bitch a bitch if it fits the description*
I'm a blizzard during climate change
The country's screwed *what the fuck can Obama change*
See the kid is dying still rocking diamond chains
Thugging on an anonymous *niggas get a name*
Black money my *conglomerate's name*
Devise strategies where *Osama was staying*
Only talk to shorty if the dime got a frame mind that's really tight *and
her waistline the same*
Fuck naw, I don't waste lines in vain
*Napoleon's like cocaine lines to the brain*
Like a vet/ opening the shorty's mind to the game
head above water/ don't want to drown in my pain
Middle of the crosshairs/ *down in the range*
Rather live like a boss here/ *lounge in the range*
Only wear it if the crown fits the frame
*These motherfuckas doing clown shit for fame*
Don't mean to ruffle yall but shit looking *ruff for yall*
Once the label hustle yall, *they reshuffle yall*
You just a tiny little *piece of the puzzle*
Manufacture this crack this is *keys in the duffle*
Peter pan bus/ *breathing this hustle*
For the green spinach, *peas and the Brussels*
Rugged and raw, if you got a problem *eat a dick/  suck it off kid*
You got it *from the fucking source*
*But of course*
*Black Money*

Chorus x8

Its getting hotter this year/ what you wanna hear/ yea!
(its Napoleon Da Legend)
The world is ours my G, yo/ what you wanna see
(dime bitties and phat stacks of money!)
