(*talking*)
Yo yo (F-E nigga the Addiction), for real man
Niggaz ain't hear from a nigga, like when I go to jail
They don't even need the paper and shit though, ya know I'm saying
Which is a good fucking thing, (where we at right now)
Welcome to the water New Orleans, nigga they call me Fiend
Ya know all wards connect down here, ya heard me
Uptown-Downtown ya know, 3rd Ward 17th
We got 7th Ward in this bitch, ya heard me
Yeah we going to Texas too nigga, whomp-whomp
 
[Fiend]
I got fifty five pounds, got five whole bricks
The L-B's train wrecked blocks, no step no whip
The city where I reside, mostly incomes fixed
Where the lights staying on, is first on our christmas list
Use to work at Subway, and my last years are calm
The money was real slow, I was doing it all wrong
I found me some good weed, I call it that say-won
My uncle died from muddy water, you know it as her-on
I'm a menace to society, feeling people watching me
So I pose like the club picture, yeah it's just my watch and me
You hate money (what), you gotta be knocking me
Don't like it, try to come putting a stop to me
 
[Hook - 4x]
I'm thugging, I'm drugging
You probably see me in your city, nigga hustling
On the grind, but we call it the swamps in my ride
I got 99 years, in the trunk
 
[Verse 2]
Bandana round my hammer, fingerprints off the cannon
Mind your mo'fucking manners, or I'll leave ya where you standing
Bodybag em (bodybag em), New Orleans Louisiana
Niggaz cause a lot of damage, won't talk if I couldn't trap or can em
Man, nigga fuck what ya'll saying
Ain't another click, fucking with the san' gang (bang bang)
Same gang slang cain, to the nameless
Blamed for a lot of thangs, still remain shameless
Same fifth same clips, still stainless
Still will leave you brainless, even if I get famous
Yeah, a heavy accent in my language
Can't even explain it, what just happened to that plaintiff
 
[Hook - 2x]
 
[Verse 3]
I can't stop hustling, I'm needed by the fiends
Can't tell I made the junkies scratch, like the magazines
Empty magazines, leave hoods full of murder scenes
Same block I hug, yellow tape it was always seen
Lil' one on the dragon's words, blame it on the coedine
Syrup and that herb, have a nigga on a crazy lean
Whip dripping wet, like a storm just passed
And the pain change colors, ery'time you walk passed it
No I ain't asked style, mo'fucker I am style
So cool, and that haze is super loud
Swag extra great, it's residue I scrape
Off the jaw, yeah I need all that cake
Money come my way, so honies come my way
Like young and dumb, no money get thrown your way
The hear the cock on the K, should see the shock on they face
Like that's around the corner, and he two steps away
