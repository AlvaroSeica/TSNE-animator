[Travie McCoy]
I know it's not your fault, but I'm a locked door
And inside I'm a mess by someone before
And I wish that I, I could find a key
to unlock all the things you want us to be
Help me open up, and start again
but there's a safe around my heart
I don't know how, to let you in
That's what keeps us apart

[Chorus]
And that's whyyyyyyyyy
I need tiiiiiiime
I said I-ahhhhhh need you
I need you to understand
Youuu-hoooo {*3X*}
I need you to understand

[Interlude]
Youuu-hoooo {*2X*}

[Travie McCoy]
Call up the locksmith, tell him we need him quick
We've got a million keys, none of 'em seem to fit
While you're on the phone, call up the clocksmith
Cause I could use some time, even the slightest bit!
Let me open up, and start again
and break this safe around my heart
I don't know how, to let you in
and that's what keeps us apart

[Chorus]

[Travie McCoy]
I'm thinkin now's the time, maybe it's time to go
If I gave you my heart, be gentle
I'm tired of laying low, let's give the world a show
And when you know, you know...
And when you know, you know, you know...
And when you know, you know, you know, you know

[Chorus]

[Outro]
I need you to understand {*3X*}
I need you {*3X*}
Youuu-hoooo {*2X*}</pre>
