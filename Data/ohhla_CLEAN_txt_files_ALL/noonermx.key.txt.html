[Verse One: Kanye West]
People keep talking
They can say what they like
I don't worry cause
Everything's gonna be alright
No one but I'm nombre uno
Hey hombre I'm "Ye" so you two though
Money sumos so haters just gonna sue mo'
What you think gonna happen when they see me in that two do'?
She gonna be with you she gonna see me she 'ret to go
Cause you half way fresh and I'm fresh head to toe
So let's go let's get let's get it hey
I know you need something different trying to get away
I use that as a segway
Sit a spot where they only speak Reggae
Like no one can do it this long
She said "aye Kan, who you tryin' to be, Akon? "
Sorry the drink have me wild in a little bit
For my link have me stylin' a little bit
I think I'm gonna head to island in a bit
But what I said had you smiling didn't it
She laughed at this
But after this
You know I gotta take that off
Young Hally told me "make me feel good"
So I gave her the Monster Balls

[Alicia Keys]
I just want you close
Where you can stay forever
You can be sure
That it will only get better
You and me together
Through the days and nights
I don't worry cause
Everything's gonna be alright
People keep talking
They can say what they like
But all I know is everything's gonna be alright

No one no one no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feeling
No one no one no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you
You you
Can get in the way of what I feel for you

When the rain is pouring down
And my heart is hurting
You will always be around
This I know for certain

You and me together
Through the days and nights
I don't worry cause
Everything's gonna be alright
People keep talking
They can say what they like
But all I know is everything's gonna be alright

No one no one no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feeling
No one no one no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you
You you
Can get in the way of what I feel for you

I know some people search the world
To find something like what we have
I know people will try
Try to divide
Something so real
So till the end of time
I'm telling you that

No one no one no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feeling
No one no one no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you
Oh oh oh...</pre>
