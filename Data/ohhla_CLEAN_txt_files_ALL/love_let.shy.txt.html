[Shyheim talking]
Dear sweetheart, I pray by the time you receive this letter
it finds you in the best of health mentally, physically, and spiritually
As for myself I'm maintaining holding my head in the belly of the beast
Listen, be careful in these streets if somethin' happens to you
I'll lose what's left of my mind you heard
Thirty six more months we on the countdown
I love you baby...

[Mya]
A good heart broken man only twenty -seven,
The go hard type, he was always lookin out for fam
Got sold out by one of his own, facin' three years upstate and his girl is late
And I know a lil secret (secret).. she ain't tryna keep it..
Been tryna tell her she got a good thing and not to leave it
The calls, the letters, honestly I'm jealous of the whole situation
But she ain't the most intelligent
If I was her... I'd wake up real quick and
If I was her... I'd stop playin with his head and
If I was her.. every week I'd pay a visit
Hold it down no matter what cause I'm a down chick
'Cause she's wildin' out havin her fun, makin me wanna say sumthin 
Feelin sorry for her man who never gets to see the sun, 
I know how much he loves her I hear it in his letters,
But I guess she still don't know a good thing even when it's gone

[Chorus 2X: Mya]
I got a friend, she a got a man, he got shackles on his hands and feet
The way that he loves her so, I wish somebody felt for me
Love letters be so sweet, love letters be so deep
Love letters be so neat every time she reads to me..
I got a friend, she got a man, he got shackles on his hands and feet
The way that he loves her so, I wish somebody felt for me
Love letters be so sweet, love letters be so deep
It breaks my heart every time, every time she reads to me..

[Shyheim]
They say all the good men is in prison or dead
That leaves a lonely pretty girl layin' in her bed
Writin' in her diary, everyday issues, questionin' herself
"Why is she still with you"?
Until that night, she meet mr right
First he listens to her ( uh-huh)...
Then gives his advice ( yup)
She's the missin link to his big gold chain
He actin' stupid when he dance like they on soul train
And She feel like a kid again, in teenage love
He really wanna kiss her, but hes happy with a hug
Told her he ain't goin nowhere so they don't have to rush
It's just the beginnin' of a lifetime crush
Now here comes the cops with their glocks and their cuffs
Lockin' him up cause he sold drugs
An untold amount of dope to a snake
She said that she'll wait...
I hope she wait

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

[Shyheim]
I miss you so much, wish this time go quicker
Buggin' in my cell, huggin' your pictures
Pretendin' these fee fee bags is you
Whew! things a towel and hot lotion can do..

[Mya]
Sick with his pen
Damn if she wasn't my friend, I'd probably would've been jumped on
And puttin' scratches on his back and shit
I wonder when he comes home, what's gonna happen if he finds out his ?

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

[Mya]
'Cause I ain't never had a man that's half the man he is y'all
I feel so guilty, because she's playing games

[Chorus] - repeat until fade</pre>
