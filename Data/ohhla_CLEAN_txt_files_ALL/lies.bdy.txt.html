[Verse One: Ice-T]
I don't want you anymore and you don't love me
I can see in your eyes when you talk to me
You don't fool me
We had our time but it's over girl, now it's deceit
I know your sleeping around on me, I know you creep
Your knives are stuck in my back so deep
The pain is killing me

[Chorus: Ice-T]
Lies, lies, lies, lies!!
A goddamn disgrace!
Lies, lies, lies!!
Straight to my fucking face!

[Verse Two: Ice-T]
I hate you with all of my heart right now
The simple sight of you makes me sick
What kind of fucking fool do you take me for?
I'm done with your shit
I gotta follow my soul right now
I gotta move to my evil side
No longer can I handle your torture
Tonight may be your last night

[Chorus: Ice-T]
Lies, lies, lies, lies!!
A goddamn disgrace!
Lies, lies, lies!!
Straight to my fucking face!

[Interlude: Ice-T]
You know, the sex never bothered me
The fact that you may have had uhh.. been with other men
It was your ability to lie to me
Look me dead in the eye and tell the lie
I should, kill you for that, I've killed many men for less

[Hook: Ice-T]
Lies, lies, lies
I don't want you anymore and.. you don't want me
I can see in your eyes when you talk to me
You don't fool me

[Chorus: Ice-T]
Lies, lies, lies, lies!!
A goddamn disgrace!
Lies, lies, lies!!
Straight to my fucking face!</pre>
