         I'm tired
         I'm tired
I'm tired of struggalin dog
I'm tired of struggalin dog
 
The System ain't Gun Change
Unless we Make it Change
 
The White House is the rock house
Uncle Sam is the motha fuckin' pusha man
What I gotta do to make sure ya understand?
Spit it on a Beat By Timbaland?
     What I gotta do? 
     Kid-nap Aaliyah?
     Take her melody?
     Make it relevant? 
Hold her harmony hostage
To these People Army verses
Slash they arms in the churches
Bombs in the purses
Jus' when you think it's calm on the surface
We bomb on the first
Uncle Tom gets nervous
     And reverses
Revolutionary curse words
"FIRST COME, FIRST SERVE"
it aint no lost love
Freedom cost blood
N that's word to the Mossberg, Nigguh
 
We need a revolution
We need a revolution
 
The System ain't Gun Change
Unless we Make it Change
                         
           X2
Black Powaaaa
R.B.G.'s x3 
Nigguh This That R.B.G.'s
           X2
 
Gotta Cure for AIDS and Cancer
Wanna Kno come follow me Now
Diabetes and Sickle cell even Mad cow
Wanna kno how?
 
I can stop these cops from killin'
I can feed these hungry children
I can stop RACISM, a product of CAP_IT_A_LISM
I can UnPack the Prison 
And turn Religion back 
To we livin
I can stop the bloods from peelin'
                     Caps
And the Crypts from peelin'
              Back,---And get 
ur cuzin off crack
I can stop the war Th-Tha
That's in the black hood
Get the money right back to the Po' fo' sho an'
If you wit me nigga , let me know
Let's go, if ya really wanna know
           (I wanna know.)
    (We need a REAL Solution)
Mutha Fuck the Constitution
 
R.B.G.'s off in this thing
They hip to the game
Gettin' off the chains 
 
The system ain't gonna change
Unless we make it change
