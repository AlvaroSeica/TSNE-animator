Typed by: Lil Hustle

(*talking*)
Nigga birds keys, whatever you wanna call it

[Chorus]
I'm trying to keep my hood, at a bird a day
If them ATF and DEA, will stay away
Cause the only way, to dodge them feds
Is to break yourself, stay on the low and count your big heads
I'm trying to keep my hood, at a bird a day
If them ATF and DEA, will stay away
Cause the only way, to dodge them feds
Is to prey on the low, and count your big heads

[Mike D]
If them funk ass feds, would leave me alone
Maybe I could stack a million, and then get gone
I'm tired of pushing these rocks, I'm sick of moving these zones
I'm thinking big Benzes, mobile phones and homes
In a comfortable position, when I spark endo
Taking trips in private jets, for the places I gotta go
Now picture that, I'm just a G from the hood
And came up from dust, to living like it's all good
Now baby mama's bringing drama, 5-0's to calm her
You know the rest when we blessed, problem after problem
All that unwanted stress, if it ain't this if it ain't that
Keeping all that plex, making me wonder what's next
Don't watch me, better watch TV
Cause all I'm doing, is getting it while it's good G
With this rap hustle, or moving these keys
Don't matter to me, just keep it low from the F-E-D's

[Chorus]
I'm trying to keep my hood, at a bird a day
If them ATF and DEA, will stay away
Cause the only way, to dodge them feds
Is to stay on the low, and count your big heads
I'm trying to keep my hood, at a bird a day
And if them ATF and DEA, will stay away
Cause the only way, to dodge them feds
Is to break yourself, stay on the low and count your big heads

[Clay-Doe]
They told me go hard stay low and get out, so I crunk it up
Down the street, next to my homie dope house
Big Flow use to tell us, that he would kill us
But we kept pumping, cause we knew he was bumping cause we was his little niggaz
Eventually they'd have to feel us, a young G
Trying to grind waited my time in line, now it's my time to shine
I took a look back, at my first thirty pack
I use to want a weed sack and Lac, but said fuck that
Since I'm in it out to get it, plus I knew it was a gimmick
Cause when you get ceased now, you want a ticket
The hustle is illest, Corleone is my witness
Fuck them hang around's if you putting it down, bidness is bidness
Hard for a G, thinking bout Kay-Kay and Dez
God please, can't feed my baby in the feds
Hard on a G, got a motherfucker scared
God please, spare a player from the feds

[Chorus - 2x]
I'm trying to keep my hood, at a bird a day
And if them ATF and DEA, will stay away
Cause the only way, to dodge them feds
Is to break yourself, stay on the low and stack your big heads

[Mr. 3-2]
Lord, have mercy on me and my G's
Please keep us safe, from F-E-D's and enemies
Cause man, it's so hard to survive in the game
From bricks of cocaine, to a million record sales stangs
Counting change, nothing but big heads
Staying on the low, breaking myself from them dirty ass feds
Watching a nigga wanna bop a nigga, but I'm clean
Got my paper stashed real good nigga, they'll never find the green
Laff-Tex, a multimillion dollar cabinet
Baby we gon' shut it down, we really ain't having it
Rap game street game, Mr. 3-2 gon' tell it
Coming at us with that plex, and you gon' need a bulletproof helmet
We major players, coming up in a major way
Even though we gon' keep it hood, with a bird a day
Hit the highway, got my people's in motion
While I'm in the studio, sipping promethazine potion

[Chorus]
I'm trying to keep my hood, at a bird a day
And if them ATF and DEA, will stay away
Cause the only way, to dodge them feds
Is to break yourself, stay on the low and count your big heads
I'm trying to keep my hood, at a bird a day
And if them ATF and DEA, will stay away
Cause the only way, to dodge them feds
Is to break yourself, stay on the low and stack big heads</pre>
