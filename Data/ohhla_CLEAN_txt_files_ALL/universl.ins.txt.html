[Mr. Lif]
just as you order tight, amplified ribs
served on a platter, make your mind chatter
my data is that of a chef
and yesterday's special is fresh emcee chest
take a closer look, you'll notice he's heartless
a shallow man with too many words to manifest
marinated and dressed, ready to ingest
I bet he wishes he ran, he didn't understand

[Insight]
he flecked off set when exposed to flow physics
critically corrodes complex techs to tidbits
granulated strips stripped down the sound basics
from fabricated mix twenty bits ? specifics
tasteless tips of clowns fit to few digits
categoric strip hits you everyday dimwits
with solitigated sound soaked in sencful solvents
slappin your syndicates lost lyric ligaments
opposition punks for a profound predicament
to end the flooded figment of hostility
hop in the cockpit quick, as I navigate
to targets optics locked in what I narrate

[Mr. Lif]
calculated time of arrival undefined
destination is knowledge, it's a trip through the mind
we've been assigned to give vision to the blind
who cant find their way out of the terrible bind
of course our arrival has been properly timed
the moon is in place, the stars are aligned
Mr.. Lif (and insight) have been combined
to take assault to a higher level of rhyme

[Insight]
aggressive flav, accurate punch impressive
snatchin' heads after which techniques are implemented
advance, dynamics, universal theoretic
enhance kinesics and kinetics
over-shadow shallow text exclaim by be pathetic
paramedic boom bap next naps relax muscles
incomparable vocalist
astronomical psychologic
he vecked off set catastrophic

[Mr. Lif]
yo, I'll pull your way out of your regular state
increase metabolism to a post-cellular rate
and as you break your self down internally
I write in my journal see thoughts that'll remain eternally
paragraphs that'll last through the mega blast
chemical warfare and even the aftermath
endure radiation as well as the fallout
and out of the darkness, my voice shall call out
reviving souls from both north to south poles
it's time to resurrect and redirect our goals
thoughts will make heat so you wont be cold
the samples are your physical, your heart is the drum roll
cherishin' lifetime, respect is the guideline
I'm chillin ?? as you progress to the sideline
and as I'm coachin' I'll refill the oceans
and nature be vast, cause my mind is open

[Insight]
by the time we closin' one notch should have soaked in
in a conscious clothing thoughts cut I and fold in
than perfectly pressed words would be in mold like clay
usin' focus flows hold as I'm creative with the logic
toxic, acidic base pumps the blood
as spirit of our ancient ancestors sharpen my vision
incisions made, negative decisions are slaughtered
bringin' back order, wax and water
my thoughts a thirst-quenching source
short of ?
while the seven seas bleeds
we've circled the earth's breeze
freezin' evil at our discresal
insight and Mr.. Lif words ? to live eternal
