[Intro: Ice-T as a Court Judge]
Will the defendant please rise!
You have been found guilty, and will be confined in a maximum state penitentiary
For return no ?? in five consecutive life sentence
There will be NO possibility of prolong
Due to special circumstances your dead ?? will be constricted

[Ice-T]
I don't remember my mama, dad sold crack all night
My life was fucked from the jumpstreet, now this kite I write
Never had half a fucking chance, my whole trial I was broke
Circumstantial that's bullshit, my defense was a joke!

[Monologue #1: Ice-T]
You go in a motherfucking courtroom, with a fucking public defender 
The public defender works with the fucking D.A.!
Motherfuckers ain't got no chance, you ain't got no money you're fucked, you're fucked!

[Ice-T]
Now this cell is my residence, my address is The Row
24 hour lock down, when they'll kill me who knows?

[Chorus:]
[Ernie] Guilty - we're the unfree!
[Ice-T] Dead man walking
[Ernie] Guilty - we're the unfree!
[Ice-T] Dead man walking

[Ice-T]
I'm a genius from books now, never read on the street
Never lifted a fucking weight, now my body is concrete
Filed a hundred appeals or more, no response from the state
Get no phone calls or visits, my mentality's hate!

[Monologue #2: Ice-T]
When I was on the street I had motherfucking boys
Where's my bitch? ~ she won't even accept my fucking phone calls! 
Yo, they better not let me up out this motherfucker
Yo, this shit's on, fuck that word!

[Ice-T]
I get visits from doctors, analyzing the ill
Families pray for my death now, vengeance lays for the kill

[Chorus:]
[Ernie] We're Guilty - we're the unfree!
[Ice-T] Dead man walking
[Ernie] Guilty - we're the unfree!
[Ice-T] Dead man walking

[Interlude #1: Court Session]
[Judge] Does the defendant have any final words, he would like to say to the court?
[Ice-T] Yeah, I got something I'd like to say ~ Yo, you judge, you're a racist motherfucker
I feel like busting your motherfucking... don't let me go!
I'm gonna kill everyone one of you jurors, If I ever get out of here
I'm coming one by one, and blow your motherfucking brains out
You motherfuckers! No, keep your motherfucking hands off! Fuck that!

[Ice-T]
So I think about my past now, my future holds only pain
Involuntarily drugged by the state for years, now I know I'm insane
When I'm moved shackled hands and feet, my skin's covered in ink
I read the bible about twenty-five times, now fuck god's how I think!

[Monologue #3: Ice-T]
You can save all that religious bullshit, stay the fuck out of my cell
If that priest comes in my cell, I'ma bust him in the..
I'll break your fucking neck with my bare hands, fuck that!

[Ice-T]
So live your life to the fullest, but remember don't trip
One mistake you're my neighbor, and there's no one here rich!

[Interlude #2: Skit from a cell block]
[-] Bring him in, yah, bring him in, yah, send him now
[+] Come here, just come here, you fucking cunt..
[-] Sit him, son of a bitch (*Sampler of Electric Shock*)

[Chorus:]
[Ernie] Guilty - we're the unfree!
[Ice-T] We're dead men walking
[Ernie] Guilty - we're the unfree!
[Ice-T] We're dead men walking</pre>
