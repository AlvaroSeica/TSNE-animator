[2D]
I'm walking to the surface
Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah, collapse
I'm drinking too much blah blah
Blah blah blah blah blah blah, fall out
I'm feeling really blah blah, I want to blah blah blah, collapse
And in the end it means I blah blah blah blah blah blah blah, depend
I brought myself together
Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah, watch out
I didn't need the beating by the blah blah blah blah blah
Don't you get too close or I'll Blah blah blah blah blah, break up
Stick it up your nose blah blah blah blah blah blah blah, eat that

[Chorus - with "Rock It" in background]
I didn't mean to do it, it lovely in my head
I tried to be a charmer, I got a bit hopeless instead
The world is very sexy, it's part of my collapse

[2D]
I'm walking to the surface
Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah, collapse
I'm drinking too much blah blah
Blah blah blah blah blah blah, fall out
I'm feeling really blah blah, I want to blah blah blah, collapse
And in the end it means I blah blah blah blah blah blah blah, event

[Chorus - with "Rock It" in background]
I didn't mean to do it, it lovely in my head
I tried to be a charmer, I got a bit hopeless instead
The world is very sexy, it's part of my collapse

[2D]
I'm walking to the surface
Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah, collapse
I'm drinking too much blah blah
Blah blah blah blah blah blah, fall out
I'm feeling really blah blah, I want to blah blah blah, collapse
And in the end it means I blah blah blah blah blah blah blah, depend

[Chorus - with just "Rock It" in background]</pre>
