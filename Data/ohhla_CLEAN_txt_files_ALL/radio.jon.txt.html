Artist: Jon LaJoie
Album:  I Kill People
Song:   Radio Friendly Song
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

It starts soft like a thousand
other songs that you've heard before
Except in this one they do a little
du-du-du-du-DU-dum-du-du

So you try to change the station
but it's playing on every one
A bunch shitty-ass chords and lyrics
recorded by a fucking moron

And you assume the the general public
is not that stupid
You're positive that nobody will want
to listen to this
But you are wrong

They wanna know the stupid
motherfucking lame cock-sucking
cookie cutter radio friendly song
And everyone sings along in their cars
and at the mall
And at the office they all love the new
radio friendly song

Un-o-ri-gi-nal me-lo-dy

Why did John Lennon have to be the one
to get shot, something's wrong
While these douche bags are all still alive
singing these ass-licking songs

All these fucking unoriginal pussies
that don't have anything to say
I'm not homophobic, but this song is
so fucking gay

You can barely retain the vomit
that's raising in your throat
And you assume that everyone will think
that this song is terrible
But you are wrong

They wanna know the stupid
motherfucking lame cock-sucking
cookie cutter radio friendly song
And everyone sings along in their cars
and at the mall
And at the office they all love the new
radio friendly ...

Piece of shit
oh what a sucky-ass piece of shit
I'd rather shoot myself in the face
than listen to this
corporate bitch singing this
stupid motherfucking lame cock-sucking
cookie cutter radio friendly piece of shit

God I hate this shit!</pre>
