[Chorus: mc chris]
mc chris owns
I wanna go to an mc chris show
But he doesn't tour, so in the meantime
I'm gonna memorize all of his rhymes

[mc chris]
I spell word with a three, name's MC
Other rappers flow weak, like window unit AC's
Latins on my penis, Japanese on they knees
I love all the ladies, as long as they eighteen
I got bling up the ying, a plethora of Porsches
I'll say anything, cause my mouth is remorseless
Even The Source says my hip-hop's a vortex
Leave horseheads on doorsteps, my mic checks cost Corvettes
The strobe light explodes white as I step on the floor
The barkeep knows the code so he throws me a Stroh's
Weak MC's decompose, cause they know I can flow
Like wessel comma zam through corruscant corridors
Humidors filled with stoges filled with 'dro
Like 9-0-2-1-0 is filled with the word bro
Fuck the lexicon of octagons I'm all about go
These amateurs got catheters I'm all about pro's

[Chorus]

[mc chris]
I'm lit like a Branch-Davidian or what's left of the lithium
In Cobain's cranium I fill Wembly Stadium
Once bitten, twice shy, call it "Pyromania"
When I roll up in Kashyyk, I roll three Jedi's
The fleet of peeps that I creep all got vest's underneath
There's no need to believe in the heat that I keep
Or the swears that I *bleep* of the heiresses I freak
It's embarrasing to me, I'm like kerosene it seems
Or D-R-E-W B with incendiary schemes blowin' up, makin' cream
I am just like Howard Dean when I scream
I get red, I get mean
Can't believe you be buying what I be shucking and jiving
Fuck it if I am the next big thing with promotional tie-ins
I am just a cartoon making rapper, you think I'm lying
Everybody bust a move like it is that rave in Zion
My self aggradizing and deprecation keeps 'em guessing
Call my Venus Flytrap, cause my DJ's Howard Hessman
Word 'em up, yo, word 'em up, yo
I just let the rap game out of a choke hold

[Chorus]</pre>
