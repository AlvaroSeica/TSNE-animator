(*talking*) 
That's right ok, Don Ke in the building 
The money don't sleep nigga 
Not where I'm from, check it out 

[Chorus] 
They say the money don't sleep, a hustler ain't tired 
Wake up getting paid, cause the paper outside 
How bout a hunnid bands, a hunnid bands 
Lately they ain't sliding, I done ran through a hundred grand 

[Lil' Keke] 
A quick six figgas, I guess we hood rich 
I'm bout my hustle bout my cash, yeah I'm good bitch 
Highly motivated, and super dedicated 
I see the faking and the hate, but I appreciate it 
The money never sleep, the cash never rests 
Real nigga first of all, don't ever second guess 
You suckers shaking hands, I'm out here making plans 
Fifty racks and doubled up, and made a hunnid bands 
This shit for ery'body, this shit for all ya'll 
I told the bitch that I was finished, but she still call 
On the grind give it time, I'ma kill ya'll 
24's on the curb, what I still crawl 

[Chorus] 
They say the money don't sleep, a hustler ain't tired 
Wake up getting paid, cause the paper outside 
How bout a hunnid bands, a hunnid bands 
Lately they ain't sliding, I done ran through a hundred grand 
This here for ery'body, this here for all ya'll 
This here for ery'body, this here for all ya'll 
This here for ery'body, that's why I still ball 
I love the grind, give it time I'ma kill ya'll 

[Lil' Keke] 
This ain't for weak niggaz, this here for grown men 
It's 4 AM, I'm still up and still going in 
You know them soldiers on the highway, making sacrifices 
I swear these books is out the roof, I'm talking drought prices 
I'm counting every grand, until you understand 
That them few bricks and couple pounds, gon' be a hunnid bands 
Now what's the destination, we got the transportation 
It's C.O.D. when you see me, so have that cash waiting 
I got that money pride, plus money never tired 
You know them FED's out here looking, keep your money quiet 
We love to hustle, and were shine like the street lights 
Give me a hunnid bands, dip and make it double twice 

[Chorus] 

[Lil' Keke] 
Hey get your paper up, put your cash down 
Get you a hunnid bands, nigga this is swag time 
Get you a couple of mo', then make em double up 
You know they doubting a real nigga, I don't give a fuck 
Oh yeah I'm hustler made, you busters underpaid 
And it's gon' cost your ass some racks, if Don on the stage 
I'm still a hardhead, Herschelwood vet 
VS-1's hunnid bands, get the whole set 
The Maserati was a dolla, and some extra change 
Boulevard flossing hard, I need a extra lane 
This shit for ery'body, not just the hood cats 
It's 7-13, we came to bring the hood back 

[Chorus]</pre>
