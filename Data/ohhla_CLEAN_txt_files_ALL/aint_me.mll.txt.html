[Intro: DJ Drama]
Alright let's be clear - they might've of done a thing or two
But their track record in the streets is "Ain't Like Me"
They ain't me {"Gangsta Grillz, you bastards!"}
Don't let 'me fool you!

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Yeah, ain't me (ain't me) ain't me (ain't me) these pussy ass niggas ain't me (ain't me)
Got a couple main hoes that I'm fuckin' round with but this one bad bitch you can't see (can't see)
And all my niggas get straight to the money, these stones all clear HD (HD)
And my DC chain shine bright, shine bright with my gold AP (AP)
Ain't me (ain't me) ain't me (ain't me) these pussy ass niggas ain't me (ain't me)
Got a couple real niggas that I'm fuckin' round with; can't come round a nigga ain't see (ain't see)
And them bricks still sell them for the high, my nigga and the drop top birds ain't cheap (ain't cheap)
And these niggas still sell the work (work) tell 'em work ain't that easy (easy)

[Meek Mill]
Ain't me (ain't me) ain't me (ain't me) these pussy ass niggas ain't me (ain't me)
These pussy ass niggas can't come to my hood cause you pussy ass niggas ain't me (ain't me)
I got all these shooters that's down for the cause and they all get money like me (like me)
And, and I still ride around my hood (my hood) quarter milli on a nigga white tee (white tee)
And y'all niggas still hatin' on it (still hatin' on it) still hatin' on it (still hatin' on it)
Talkin' what they gonna do to me but I'm strapped up and I'm waitin' on it (we waitin'!)
These niggas ain't built like that (like that) these niggas get killed like that (like that)
Runnin' 'round my name in their mouth, banana clips get peeled like that (like BLRRRT~!)
And they wonder why I feel like that cause every other month I make a mill like that
Took my whole family up out that hood, set 'em all nice in the hills like that, shit real like that
You ain't gotta like my shit (no!) pay for the flow, I don't write my shit (no!)
Better pray to God I don't like your bitch (no!) cause if she catch eye then she might get hit!
WOAH!

[Chorus] + "ain't me"

[Yo Gotti]
Fo'real, I am.. hey
Ay Meek, I feel you on this shit
Yo, hah...

I'm a real ass nigga and I've been like that, day one and I ain't gone change
In the hood nigga act a little different when I come through cause a nigga got a little change
Little pussy ass nigga don't test no nigga cause if he do then its gon' be flames
That .40 gon' go bang-bang, them niggas might say my name
My young niggas got rollies on, bitches got them Birkins on
My trigger finger been itchin'; my patients short, but my money long
It's +Levels+ to this shit for real
Boy I'm +Dreamchasin'+ tryna see a hundred M's
Got the plug on deck if I wanna go back, put work in the trap what you know about that
Pillow talkin' to ya ho hatin' on a nigga, fuck around lose ya ho like that
Ain't me (ain't me) ain't me (ain't me) these rappin' ass niggas ain't me (nah)
Only fuck with real niggas like Meek (What up meek?) you ain't CMG or DC (hey!)

[Chorus] + "ain't me"

[Omelly]
Ain't me (ain't me) these pussy ass niggas ain't me (ain't me)
Gettin' money, my day ones you know we reppin' DC (DC)
Cousin dropped that bag on you, I kill you niggas for free (BLRRRT~!)
I got all this money on me, I got all these hundreds on me ho (turn up)
Backin' up in this Panamera with some rich ass hoes (SKRRT SKRRT!)
Started off with a quarter ounce, had to get that dough (get that dough)
Flip them, move circles on them like Tic-Tac-Toe (flip flip)
Hoes ready they fucking sucking on the get-set-go

[Chorus] + "ain't me"

[Outro: DJ Drama]
I guess we can't tell you enough
What you do won't make you me
Truthfully some of you niggas need to get some more sleep
Your dreams aren't manifestin' correctly
Knock 'em out, baby</pre>
