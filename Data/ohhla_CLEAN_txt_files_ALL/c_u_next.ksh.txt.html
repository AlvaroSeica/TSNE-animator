[Ke$ha]
I was lookin lost, it was cold outside
The whiskey rocks how you caught my eye
My red lips painted, just got them black
I needed somethin to bring me back
You knew the play and we danced all night
But somethin wasn't right

[Chorus]
So I'll see you next Tuesday
If I ever get desperate orr I'm so beyond faded
Just said I'll see you next Tuesday
Kinda nice how this morning I would sit around waiting
And I'm not just being cold, I'm just watching you pretend
Like your heart is on your sleeve, when I know you have a girlfriend
I'll see you next Tuesday - ohh ohh, ohh ohh, oh

Ohh ohh, ohh ohh {*autotuned*}

[Ke$ha]
You won't call, and you won't admit (won't admit)
The lies you spin for your power trip
And I just can't take you seriously
When all you send is a text to me
So I'll be gone when the morning comes
Let's not pretend it's love

[Chorus]

[Ke$ha]
I don't want anything from this; I got your number
Don't call me I'll call you if I need a hit (ohhh)
I don't need no drama from this; I know you got your girl
and I don't need a dude on my {shit}
So I'll see you next Tuesday (I'll see you next Tuesday)

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Ohhh! Ohhh! .. Ah-ohh, ah-oh-oh {*autotuned*}
So I'll see you next Tuesday (I'll see you next Tuesday)
So I'll see you next Tuesday
I'll see you next Tuesday
Ah-ohh, ah-oh-oh {*autotuned*}
So I'll see you next {*fades out*}</pre>
