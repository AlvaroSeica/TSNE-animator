[Juelz Santana]

baby girl I drag my nuts for free
comfortably
and ya know I got my pimpin together
got my game, got my cain, got my limpin'
together, shit bitch you better get your
switchin' together cuz this back-hand
will get you together, hope you know that
and sometime I cant belive my niggaz
still in all, I'll give it all just to feed my
niggaz, eat, dont stop homie breathe my niggaz
I need y'all more than y'all ever need me my niggaz

[Hook]

[J.R. Writer]
Hey ma, its J.R. and L's
it ain't hard to tell
we da niggaz in we da niggaz in Maury and car alarm da fell wit that hard to sell
that ain't hard to sell
and a gun that'll hit you from far as hell
u quick to flash , we'll whip yo' ass
couple shots hit your glass
Dip-shit ya whip will crash
I got the sickest past
stay skippin' class, pitchin' Hash
all day, stood there
flippin' halves
when I heard ,Squalie!
I dished and dashed
ditched the hash
park, neutral, first gear
hit the gas, now we rich with cash
and when I hear Squalie!
I sit and laugh, dawg you kiss his ass
cooked more caine, push off dames
while you dumb niggaz stand there
and look all lame
I done popped and took off chains
now Ivory dump ice on me like my team
won a football game!</pre>
