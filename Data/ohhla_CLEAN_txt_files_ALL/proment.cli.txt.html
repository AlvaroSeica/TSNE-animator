[Verse One: George Clinton]
The world is a toll-free toilet
Our mouths neurological assholes
And psychologically speaking
Is we're in a state of mental diarrhea
Talking shit a mile a minute
Or in a state of constipated notions
Can't think of nothing but shit
And this is world of stinky futures
Between shitty memories, and constipated 19 now-nows
Emerges from the hiney of your head
The doo doo chasers
The Promentalshitbackwashpsychosisenemasquad
The prune juice of the mind
The doo doo chasers, friends of roto-rooter
Bringing you music to get your shit together by;
The band in the tidy bowl of your brain

[Hook: Linda Brown]
What was that long word again-Promental?
The Promentalshitbackwashpsychosis Enema Squad

[Interlude: George Clinton]
A musical bowel movement
Designed to rid you of moral diarrhea
Social bullshit, crazy do-loops, and mental poots
They call us the unflushables, one swipe a clean wipe

[Hook: Linda Brown]
Go flush it, fellows!

[Verse Two: George Clinton]
And what causes all of this shit?
What is the source of food for thought?
Ego-munchies, images doggie bags
My burger with hot sauce on it
Me burger with hot sauce on it
A myself sandwich, a personal burger, hamburger
And a glass of constricted Cola
Out to lunch with lunch meat
The fear of being eaten by a sandwich
The Promentalshitbackwashpsychosis Enema Squad
The doo doo chasers, friends of roto-rooter
Music to clean your shit by; an Enema Squad

[Hook: Linda Brown]
Also wanted to hear.. 

[Verse Three: George Clinton]
Low calorie logic, muscle brains, skinny brains
Count the calories of your thoughts
Funk, Confucius says, like Chinese laxatives
Sweet and sour bowel movements
And in this world of stinking memories
Stinking memories, and shitty futures
19 now nows-constipated-like, versions the doo doo chasers
The prune juice of the mind
The band in the tidy bowl of your brain
Bringing you music to clean your shit by

[Hook: Linda Brown]
Hummmm.. Hummm.. Humm...

[Verse Four: George Clinton]
Funk; the P-Preparation, the prune juice of the mind
The mental musical bowel movement
Groovalax, one swipe a clean wipe
And with no extra charge
A psychological trend mover, a neurological enema
Holy Shit (let me try one-crap)
Corpolite, prehistoric doo doo
Helping you get your shit together
Backstage at a Funkadelic rehearsal
We bring you the doo doo chasers (Which one is George Clinton?)
Out to lunch with lunch meat, once again
The fear of being eaten by a sandwich
Lunchville, where lunch is a nice time of day at least twice a week

[Outro: George Clinton]
The Fried Ice Cream is a reality, fried Ice Cream is a reality!
The Fried Ice Cream is a reality, fried Ice Cream is a reality!
The Fried Ice Cream is a reality, fried Ice Cream is a reality!
(Which one is George Clinton?)
Guess who's coming to lunch
I'm not gonna pay for this lunch, man!
The Fried Ice Cream is a reality, fried Ice Cream is a reality!
The Fried Ice Cream is a reality, fried Ice Cream is a reality!
The Fried Ice Cream is a reality, fried Ice Cream is a reality!</pre>
