(SLAUGHTERHOUSE!) "Presents, the way it began."

[Intro]
"Let's see now.
 First thing I can remember is an evening years back.
 The four of us was together even then.
 And from that time on, nothing was ever gonna be quite the same again.
 Yeah, especially us."

[Royce Da 5'9"] + (Selena Jordan)
G-G-God given, I'm killin this bomb bid'ness
I'm callin rap that because I put my time in it
I-I don't mind bein, ready to die as long as it's at an arena 
and we did it and my momma seen it
This is my arm swingin, and my alarm ringin
Fightin against time but writin is on singin
In light of my wallet just look how the mighty have fallen
You fell forward, say bye to them, say hi to Ryan maturin
I can't (lose) cause God won't let me (lose)
Bet against me and you gon' (lose) anybody'll tell you (nah)
Nah, I knew the cats knew I was down so I fell back
Hit the ground landed on my feet vertical, fell back through
So you can (lose) I will never lay down and (lose)
I-I-I was definitely about to (lose) then Eminem came like (nah)
Nah, this shit is entertainin
Listen to the shit they sayin, venom is sprayin
Which is why, all I know
is I'm at an all-time ultimate high inspired by an all-time low

[Chorus 2X: sample from "Ali In the Jungle" by The Hours]
"Oh-ohhh-oh, oh-ohhh-oh, oh-ohhh-oh"
"How quick are you gonna get up? How quick are you gonna get up?"

[Crooked I] + (Selena Jordan)
In these days life is short, shots'll try to end you
And this game is like a sport, comp'll try to pin you
I leave the stage on life support when I rock a venue
If you ain't got a knife and fork you probably on the menu
If I ain't make history before I left
It'll be like usin my last important breath before my death for snortin meth!
More or less I'm, Jordan-esque, I ignore the refs
I sell ya like you morphed into an orphan, yes!
(Lose) Nah, I never (lose)
Yeah, you said I would (lose) my destiny said (nah)
Homie you went against me, foolish as Judas, nigga you're lost
Now I'm feelin like Black Jesus, wrong nigga to cross
Won't (lose) if I refuse to (lose)
The fact that I used to (lose) is makin me say (nah)
This is how we attackin it, four rappers who passionate
took the idea of a group and re-imagined it 
without plannin it, now the whole planet has to admit that's the shit!

[Chorus]

[Joell Ortiz] + (Selena Jordan)
Uhh, e'rybody y'all invited to a crazy party
Have some fun blockin the sun with the Shady army
These women is feelin like skin baby they be on me
My flow water for sure, I'm a great tsunami
I'm with my awesome clique, on another tourin trip
From front of the stage all the way back to the door it's thick
Like secretly filmin a mob we recordin hits
What a fuckin lifestyle, maybe that's why I'm on my dick
(Lose) Man I ain't about to (lose)
I don't know how to (lose) you beatin the Yaowa? (nah)
Mr. Ortiz, I got you, can't find a reason not to
My ink take 'em to church, guess you could call it Pentecostal
Man Eminem told me +(Lose) Yourself+ so how can I (lose) focus?
You roaches (lose) in combat, so war? (nah)
But if y'all need me to make it clear, for those slightly impaired
Like a flat in a snowstorm with no gas we ain't goin nowhere
We the 60-minute group cause this year finna be hour/our year!

[Chorus]

[Joe Budden] + (Selena Jordan)
A mixture of showman and skill, imposin my will, a visionary
Want me with my back to the ground, I ain't with the missionary
Walk in my shoes and reap all that I gained
Along with every invisible wall that accompanies fame
Louis Vuitton frames cover the scars that go with stardom
Got enemies that I birthed, these bars are for postpartum
So I tuck me the steel plate
They threatenin me from behind a condom but you can't scream fuck me and feel safe
You'll just (lose) some people are prayin I (lose)
I thought I was set up to (lose) then Slaughterhouse came like (nah)
Nah, so I live by a real simple philosophy
If you stay grounded watch God keep givin you reasons not to be
Can't (lose) it's not in my plan to (lose)
If I so happen to (lose) is that even possible? (nah)
Keep that outta my reach, still I'm prayin the sheep get manifested
Let the flow stage dive and hope that the fans'll catch it
If you ever persevered you should understand the message

[Chorus]

[Outro]
"The rest, what they say, is history."
