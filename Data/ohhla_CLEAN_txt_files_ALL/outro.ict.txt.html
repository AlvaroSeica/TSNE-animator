* only on the original cassette version of Rhyme Pays

[Ice-T Freestyling]
This album is dedicated to Rhyme Syndicate
They hear my records before they're made
When they just on paper; when the demo is laid
At Six PM when the cops run they raid
And we don't worry about suckers cause they will get sprayed
PEACE!! PEACE!! PEACE!! PEACE!! 	   		   </pre>
