[Intro: Talib]
As we continue on
From the top, yea
Off top, uh
Blacksmith, P.O.C., yea
Pussycats, kittens, Black Panthers
Cougars and tiger moms
From the top, uh
Yea, yea, hold it now!

[Talib Kweli]
I got a buzz like I'm Georgia Tech
They still cheerin like I'm all that's left
The air is toxic when you draw your breath
Resurrect the music, I'm snatchin it from the claws of death
The vital signs are improvin, I make 'em lay down
An idle mind is usually described as the devil's playground
My rep established, I'm rappin just for the sport of it
Been nice for a career, you just barely graspin the thought of it
(Hold it now!) Indebted to the hood like a RushCard
Supported by push-up bras and lumbar
Except I'm never sittin, I'm ever-livin like Mumm-Ra, I'm the sun God
Smart as a whip but forever rippin it dumb hard
I see you frontin with your dollar store shades on
Faker than abs that's sprayed on, artificial as rayon
My rhymin satisfyin your +Quest for Fire+ like Rae Dawn
Chong, when I'm formin like Voltron, I'm young Raekwon
Mix in a bit of KRS-One and Q-Tip
Rakim, some of that Ice Cube, now who's this?
No one as gifted as this, so magnificent
Classically consistent, I'm nasty as black licorice
The coldest but I get the room hotter than Bikram Yoga
Seen the show you know I make the people move like an eviction notice
I'm focused, I'm like Moses when the mic is on
That's why these rappers scatter like roaches when the light is on

Hold it now! I, I, I hold it down
I'm stayin where I'm at, you better go around
You know the voice and you know the sound
I rip the microphone and then I throw it down
Hold it now; I, I, I hold it down
I'm stayin where I'm at, you better go around
You know the voice and you know the sound
I RIP the microphone and then I THROW it down! {*echoes*}
