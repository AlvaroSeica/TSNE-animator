what's wrong with the world, mama?
people livin like they ain't got no mamas
I think the whole world's addicted to the drama
only attracted to the things that'll bring the drama
overseas ya we tryin to stop terrorism
but we still got terrorists here livin
in the U.S.A, the big C.I.A
the bloods &amp; the crips, and the KKK
but if you only got love for your own ways
then you only leave space to discriminate
and to discriminate only generates hate
and when you hate, then you're bound to get irate
madness is what you demonstrate
and that's exactly how anger works and operates
man ya gotta have love, this'll set us straight
take control of your mind and meditate
let your soul gravitate, to the love ya'll

people killin
people dyin
children hurt and
women cryin
will you practice what you preach
and would you turn the other cheek
father father father, help us
need some guidance from above
these people got me got me questionin
where is the love?
(love) where is the love?
(the love) where is the love?
(the love) where is the love?
(where is the love the love my love)

it just ain't the same
old ways have changed
new days are strange, is world insane?
if love and peace is so strong
why are there pieces of love that don't belong
nations droppin bombs
chemical gasses fillin lungs of little ones
with ongoin sufferin, as the youth die young
so ask yourself, is the lovin really gone
so I can ask myself, really what is going wrong
with this world that we livin in, people keep on givin in
makin wrong decisions, only visions of them dividends
not respectin eachother, deny thy brother
a war is goin on but the reason's under cover
the truth is kept secret, and swept under the rug
if you never know truth, then you never know love
where's the love ya'll? (i don't know)
where's the truth ya'll? (i don't know)
and where's the love ya'll?

people killin
people dyin
children hurt and
women cryin
will you practice what you preach
and would you turn the other cheek
father father father, help us
need some guidance from above
these people got me got me questionin
where is the love?
(love) where is the love?
(the love) where is the love?
(the love) where is the love?
where is the love?
(love) where is the love?
(the love) where is the love?
(the love) where is the love?
(where is the love the love my love)

I feel the weight of the world on my shoulder
as I'm getting older, ya'll people gets colder
most of us only care about money makin
selfishness got us followin the wrong direction
wrong information always shown by the media
negative images is the main criteria
infecting the young minds faster than bacteria
kids wanna act like what they see in the cinema
..
whatever happened to the values of humanity?
whatever happened to the fairness and equality
instead of spreading love we spreadin animosity
lack of understandin leading us away from unity
that's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin under
that's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin down
It's no wonder why sometimes I'm feelin under
gotta keep my faith alive till love is found
now ask yourself

where is the love?
where is the love?
where is the love?
where is the love?
father father father, help us
need some guidance from above
these people got me got me questionin
where is the love?
now sing with me ya'll (one love one love)
we only got (one love one love)
that's all we got (one love one love)
and something's wrong with it
something's wrong with it
something's wrong with the w-w-world
we only got (one love one love)
that's all we got (one love one love)</pre>
