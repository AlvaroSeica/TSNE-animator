[Intro: Fabolous]
I just like wakin up, right next to that thang (La di da, da da!)
Thought I could roll over and, go another round

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige] (*Chris Brown)
I won't be holdin back my love I won't be holdin back
I won't be holdin back my love no I won't be holdin back
'Cause in the end you know I'm a want another round
(Another Round) another round (Another Round) 
Boy you know I want another round, another round (A round, a round with you)
(*I used to want you and her and her and her and you with her with her)
And now you got me and only me and I, I'm a give you my all I want is you

[Verse One: Fabolous] (*Mary J. Blige)
Hair in a bun 'cause sometimes that hair just hides your beauty
Swear on my son ain't too many things could hide your booty (Nice!)
Call me what you like but bet I slide with cutie ('Bout that)
Kenny name wasn't Bud but he still ride with Rudy (Nice!)
And that's why we comfortable like a Huxtable
You been around since the lunchables, girl I fucks with you
In the back of the truck with you, same fingers I chuck with two
I'm just playin with you, thinkin 'bout stayin with you
Not forever but at least until the A.M. with you (*Gimme your love)
Still playin with it, but I like it raw (*Gimme your love)
Might need a mornin after, what we did the night before (*Gimme your love)
Might go another round if your tryin to fight me more (*Gimme your love)

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige] (*Chris Brown)
I won't be holdin back my love I won't be holdin back
I won't be holdin back my love no I won't be holdin back
'Cause in the end you know I'm a want another round
(Another Round) another round (Another Round) 
Boy you know I want another round, another round (A round, a round with you)
(*I used to want you and her and her and her and you with her with her)
And now you got me and only me and I, I'm a give you my all I want is you

[Verse Two: Fat Joe]
Cake cake cake cake cake you know you love it
Icing like Nuvo with a touch of Red Velvet
Look at you, you a star, I'm a G, Joe the don
Super thief, I go hard, in these sheets, I'm a God
Lord, Emilio Pucci leggings for good behavior 
I wanna tear them shirts off you like Hulkamania
Then dive up in the pussy Superfly Snuka
Have you coming back to back, more sex to cook up
But ask the girl will I hit advance
She post it out picture perfect, Instagram
I hit home runs and drain last shots
She tore her ACL, from all the backshots

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige] (*Chris Brown)
I won't be holdin back my love I won't be holdin back
I won't be holdin back my love no I won't be holdin back
'Cause in the end you know I'm a want another round
(Another Round) another round (Another Round) 
Boy you know I want another round, another round (A round, a round with you)
(*I used to want you and her and her and her and you with her with her)
And now you got me and only me and I, I'm a give you my all I want is you

[Verse Three: Kirko Bangz]
Since, she done came down
Double cup with ice man I think she got some drank from me
Ever since I came 'round
She say she feel wrong 'cause her boyfriend listen to me
I don't give a damn 'bout it
That nigga if he trip I got a whole clique of killers with me
See I'm the man now
Rollin 24's through the hood women checkin for me
Girl I ain't playin 'round
Pull up to the crib hope you wearin somethin special for me
And I'm a lay it down
Round one, two, and three will you keep up with me

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige] (*Chris Brown)
I won't be holdin back my love I won't be holdin back
I won't be holdin back my love no I won't be holdin back
'Cause in the end you know I'm a want another round
(Another Round) another round (Another Round) 
Boy you know I want another round, another round (A round, a round with you)
(*I used to want you and her and her and her and you with her with her)
And now you got me and only me and I, I'm a give you my all I want is you
