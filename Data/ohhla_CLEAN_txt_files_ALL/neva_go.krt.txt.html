[Chorus]
I wish I was a kid again
running with my friends and them, up and down the street
Waiting on the better ring, riding on the school bus, drawing on the seats
On the phone all night with a girl I like cause she claims she's a freak
It's straight I could neva go back
I would neva go back, but it would be cool to see

Rise and shine, get up off my ass and mash for cash
No time to procrastinate
Yeah, I'd rather drink a 40 but that have to wait
I ride a bucket kinda of rusty but I blast the bass
On the road again for the pro's within
The block used to be sunny but they snowed it in
Now the junky straight changed for the dollar menu
That's what he said, but the rock is what he really into
Gave him a dollar anyway, cause who knows
Maybe the dope boy's baby needs some new clothe
Could we all going and through it, no matter how you view it
Slice it, cut it, bring it back or screw it
Hot as ever been but I'm cooling ah
A/C never work so my windows, down
Not worry, kids scurry Saturday's, reminiscing good Lord
how I use to run and play
Sometimes

[Chorus]

Grandma annie on the go, cooking in the kitchen something good for my soul
G.I. Joe's all on her living room floor
It seems like yesterday, but she passed so long ago, good heavens
I wanna go to church but ain't no good reverends
She probably frowning on me now because I know better
But I push on, searching for some cush'on
To pay the the bills and responsibilities that I diss on
Not a pot to piss in a tree to piss on, the devil come around too much
I'm hollering get gone
But it's hard to get off when you can't get on
I put my life on this waxÂ… nobody "lists-ons"
So I cruise, me and just my blues
Looking at the world through my broken rear view
Not worried, cause I pray for better days, reminiscing good Lord
how I used to run and play
Sometimes

[Chorus]

Miss lady outside in her garden,
My brother his son and his daughter
the rap game before I was spittin
back when Pac and Biggie were living
