Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

I'm here to let the world know I'm hard to the TRU
You can't conquer my soul
Bossalinie, a living legend
With physical evidence, the world, full of corruption

	It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
	how I keep from goin under (how I keep from goin under)
	It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
	how I keep from goin under (how I keep from goin under)

Random hits on the block, young homies packin glocks
Picture me a TRU villain, visualizin fools dyin quicker
Murder Murder's in the heart of every killer
Take a look into his eyes, it's evidence, of a homicide
Life gettin tooken faster than the egg leave the womb
Consider me endangered cause I know I'm dyin soon
Twenty-five years incarceration if I pull it
Bring the yellow tape, haters cain't overcome my bullets
Went to jail, tryin to get paid, still on a rampage
Jumped behind some bushes, dodgin cops, another close shave
I'm bumpin heads with the reaper
On a daily basis, can't sleep, with nightmares of dead faces
And watch the man in the mirror, I don't trust him
Check his weapon, it's a shame he got his boy blood on the muzzle
That's why I turn my head and leave him lonely, he phony
He got the whole hood waitin on the ceremony

	It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
	how I keep from goin under (how I keep from goin under)
	It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
	how I keep from goin under (how I keep from goin under)

I take a deep breath as I blaze this green mixed with hash
and trippin how the Outlawz smoked Tupac ashes
My homie Bad A$$ laid it down, he told me,
"C, real figures, gon' always be around
Livin in the minds and the hearts of the lost souls"
And much love to them Thugged Out Outlawz
Backstage, choppin game with Sean Dogg and Snoop Dogg
and to my thugs in the grave, we miss y'all
I give a toast to you soldiers, you ain't die for nuttin
I read the Bible say, every death mean somethin
And TRU soldiers make the world go 'round
Picked up the black history book and can't seem, to put it down
Black leaders gettin struck down at they peak
Open your eyes that an unliberated life is weak
And throw em up if you a soldier, I told ya
we'll burn this place down, cause them holocaust days is over

	It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
	how I keep from goin under (how I keep from goin under)
	It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
	how I keep from goin under (how I keep from goin under)

	It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
	how I keep from goin under (how I keep from goin under)
	It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
	how I keep from goin under (how I keep from goin under)

Hmm, it's like a jungle out here baby (like a jungle out here)
From the streets to the top of the world (the world)
It's changin, and you got the eye on you, you don't even know
The eyes that's watchin yo' life, youknahmsayin, but uhh
we gotta maintain youknahmsayin evade all the problems
and danger brought on by accounts of struggle (struggle)
in society, a.k.a. the streets, a.k.a. our enemies (out enemies)
Black leaders (black leaders) keep doin what you doin (ya heard?)
P (P) keep doin what you doin (keep doin what you doin)
Know me -- I'ma keep bein the mouthpiece, for the hood
for the streets - cause I told ya, it's like a jungle baby
(straight up jungle) so keep it real (keep it real)
guard your grill (guard your grill) stay safe (stay safe, ya heard?)
(peace, it's like a jungle baby, it's like a jungle)</pre>
