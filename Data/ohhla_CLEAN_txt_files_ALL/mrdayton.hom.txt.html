Verse 1:
My name is Dayton, the triple gold killa,
I be the reason for murder to a po black young nigga.
Flow deep on your shit lookin' hella clean.
See, I'm the reason, that niggas look at you mean.
I bring jealousy and hate when I roll through.
Havin' niggas jockin' on your car that you never new.
I make the game worth winnin', gold spokes spinnin',
But don't let me catch your ass slippin'.
I have your whole crew checked at the intersection,
So you best invest in more protection.
The evil that I bring ain't no good.
I'm smokin' Vogues, through every niggas neighborhood.
And where I'm from, I get more props than the president,
Cuz when a nigga gets killed, I'm the evidence.
So it's 1-8-7 all day.
Niggas don't understand, I'm a G.

(chorus1)
They call me Mr. Dayton, the triple gold killa,
I be the reason for murder to a po strapped young nigga.
Just call me Mr. Dayton, just call me Mr. Dayton.
My name is Dayton, the tripple gold killa,
I be the reason for murder to a po strapped young nigga.
Just call me Mr. Dayton.

Verse 2:
They call me Dayton, I'm pushin' more keys than a locksmith,
So what the law never saw, can't stop shit.
Triple golds on that ass, with a hun'ed spokes.
I'll let the one-time know that you sell dope.
How can a nigga wit no job on probation
Have enough scratch to relax on some gold daytons?
And even if I'm stolen,
It don't matter, cuz I'm sittin' on the next nigga's shit rollin'.
So catch me if you can Mr. D-A,
I'm in the hood, smokin' dank, gettin' three ways.
Cocaine, triple beam, and amphetamines.
That's somethin' you don't see up in the magazines.
So it's 1-8-7 all day.
Some don't understand, I'm a G.

(chorus2)
My name is Mr. Dayton, the triple gold killa,
I be the reason for murder to a po black young nigga.
Just call me Mr. Dayton, just call me Mr. Dayton.
My name is Dayton, the triple gold killa,
I be the reason for murder to a po black young nigga.
Just call me Mr. Dayton.

Verse 3:
1 nigga, 2 killas, 3 daytons, 4.
It's murder after dark, when them G's ride low.
Reflections of death, triple gold punk bit the block on them thangs,
Now every bitch know my name.
Ain't no hope, when I step out the station,
Every nigga sprung on them guns and the gold daytons.
All day, every day, it's the same shit,
Every nigga tryin' to find his way up out the game, quick.
Cuz Mr. Cop and Mr. Fed want a nigga dead.
But the park's in my heart, so them fools bled.
I'm hittin' corners, pushin' levels with that deep shit.
These undercovers tryin' to catch me on the weak tip.
I'm from the 4-block, but the OG's, they rock forever
Don't slip on these dark streets cuz the one-time way too clever.
Home invasion, I'll have a nigga soaked in blood.
Niggas can't deal with that Oak Park Terrel love.
West Coast murder, home of the feds.
Bloodshed every where, motherfuckers dead.
It's that nigga, 7-8-1 all day.
Some don't understand, I'm a G.

(chorus3)
They call me Mr. Dayton, the triple gold killa,
I be the reason for murder to a po black young nigga.
Just call me Mr. Dayton, My name is Mr. Dayton...</pre>
