[mc chris]
Ahhh-hahhhh~!
Beer I love it, I guzzle it down
And dope I smoke it pound for pound
And girls I love them but they can't be found
Cause they're throwin curve balls from the pitcher's mound
Cheesesteaks - I eat them when my hungers fierce
I love my girl who's tongue is pierced
Every Thursday at eight my family would watch Cheers
Imagine people drinkin beers watchin people drinkin beers
Alcohol is evil, foot and mouth introducer
Like a thread in a needle it's a sexual seducer
Name is mc chris, mc bucks is my producer
Keep your bum away from Mr. Motor cause he might goose her
Wild Turkey to the rooster, mimosa in the mornin
Doin shots like Goose when marijuana's what you wantin
Cause your stomach needs some pumpin, liver needs some lovin
And your girl she needs a johnson that's worthy of shovin

[Chorus]
Whiskey River, don't leave me hangin
I need a cold one to keep the cool kids bangin
Whiskey River, I don't wanna drive
I'm gonna have to face the rest of my life

[mc chris]
Gin and tonic, rather than the chronic
Watch the bubbles fizzle, it's kinda hypnotic
If beer was water, you know I'd be an aquatic
Beer makes you transform cause beer is robotic
Enough about it, or have I said too little
Take my beer away from me and play monkey in the middle
I kid you not; you'll be eatin snot
if you fool with my brews or partake in my pot
without askin, don't be +Robbin+
me like +Baskin+ or else you'll be sobbin
Throwin punches while I'm hobknobbin
A one way ticket on me to John Hopkins
I'm stockin my cellar with liquor propellers
So me and the fellas drink two and burp like hella
A melon that's throbin come mornin time
I'm in another fat pickle from drinkin and rhymin

[Chorus]

[Interlude]
Know what I mean? Ah break it down baby

[Chorus]

[repeat 5X]
Whiskey River, don't leave me hangin
I need a cold one to keep the cool kids bangin

[Outro]
Whiskey River, don't leave me hangin
I need a cold one to keep the cool kids
Keep the cool kids bangin</pre>
