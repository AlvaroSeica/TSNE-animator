[Chorus]
I used to date a girl named, "World."
Sis was real glamorous arrayed up in diamonds and pearls
But now I've got a new best friend
Because the world will leave you dry and watch you die in the end

I used to date a girl named, "World."
Sis was real glamorous arrayed up in diamonds and pearls
She was the baddest, the phattest, she was established
And with her universal status - she had me livin' lavish
She knew about my sinful habits. She used to feed them
She offered me the fruits of lust (and yep) I used to eat them
She took my freedom. Warnings came, I wouldn't heed them
And when I mentioned God she said, "Chill you don't need Him."
I second-guessed this but then she pulled out those dresses, tight
fittin' ones made by Mercedes and Lexus
Her neck just exploded with the fragrance of passion
The aroma of fame, fortune, and fashion
Snatching' my heart she romanced me, my plans be
Lover for life make her, make her my wife, I can't see..
 breaking' up like I can't see me in a S girl
This is dedicated to my ex-girl

[Chorus]

The lust of the flesh
you bring your best to the city so Now sex is
pushed through the radio and video
All was chill we'd build and share thrills together
She gave cheddar, we stayed close knit like a sweater
I gave her letters, secular rap format to better
Inform her, "Miss I'm on ya, I'm down forever."
I remarked, "Dear sweetheart let me spark the fire"
"I admire the way you supply a brother's desire"
The lust of the flesh, you bring your best to the city so
Now sex is pushed through the radio and video
Then the lust of the eyes
You make sure guys look good to the girls
and girls show more and more thighs
You're wise, you know the pride of life makes us brag
We're gassed on who we are, what we do and what we have
But tragically thoughts of loneliness be attackin' me
You know how that can be so you offer me crack and weed
Distractin' me from reality with pleasure
Giving me treasure lettin' me indulge without measure
Your hands out you want my soul in it plus the mastery
Then you'll be mine with no limit just like Master P
You captured me, I thought you were all I needed
Until I found a Bible and decided to read it
I never could think that you could have any competition 'til
sweated the Bible's Author and it's Editor
You fretted to hear of the One that I met at the
Appointed time, he kept coming' after me like a creditor
A date, we set it up, and the He showed me His nail prints
Then the eternal scale and your riches started palin'
Now I know why my girl dissed Him
Because the World pissed Him
off and now he hates the whole world system

[Chorus]

In your heart I would hope you'd vote Messiah for President
Cause life's too up and down like a dieters measurement
It's evident the side of God is unattractive
Because the world diamonds and the pearl have got you captured
If their love is greater you can have them
But who died so new lives can come to the son's of Adam
So don't miss the crucial nature of the crucifixion
With diction I'll stress this one
If Jesus Christ wasn't nailed to The Cross Movement
If there was no blood lost we'd have to pay our own cost
Who can pay for their own sins
Next to God grown men become little girls with no ends
Daily my mind gets revamped
And on the Lord there's more concentration than a camp
God stamps His divine approval
On the One who puts God the Son in the forefront on the usual
Fools will bow down to a dead president
And turn around and say there's no God despite the evidence
I recommend we prepare for the reckoning
He didn't have to go out on a limb
