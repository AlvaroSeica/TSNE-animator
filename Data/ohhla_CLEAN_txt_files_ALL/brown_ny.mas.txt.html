[Master Fuol (???)]
(Brownsville) For real, bout to act a fool
Girls all over the world screamin 'It's Master Fuol!'
I have to do what I have to do, clap one, now clap the tool
Give you a standing ovation and, clap the crew
Hit shots out the park like Barry Bonds
Run around Jane when she married Juan
So I tap that ass till after dawn
Smoke some shit that a cat pissed on
Bump heads in the bed like ?capricorn?
Got two guns, I'll strap em on
Eat it up, beat it up till the crack of dawn
Pool at your crib like Cappadon
Fully armed, things I don't blaze on, put the cape on, niggas, they gone
I keep a game broad, and I stay charmed
Fully armed, things I don't blaze on, put the cape on, niggas, they gone
Get caught like Nate Dogg before a rape charge

[Chorus: Master Fuol (??)]
(Brownsville New York)
I keep the clubs poppin, I keep them shows rockin, I keep that dough poppin
(When I'm with my breezies)
I keep them hoes flockin, I keep them strippers topless, I keep them panties droppin
(When I'm out in Cali)
I keep the fame poppin, I keep the spot hot, I keep the cops watchin
(Any other place I be)
I keep the stairs crunk, I keep my fans crunk, I keep they hands up

[Interlude: Master Fuol (Roscoe)]
(Now put your squads up, now put your hands up)
Act up a ??? before I clap up your boyfriend

[Master Fuol (???)]
(Brownsville New York) Where you stop to party
Came in, got shot and dropped, we sorry
In (Brownsville New York), home of ABGs
Where anybody can get it, shit, even me
I'm from (Brownsville New York) dead bodies in allies
We wildin at rallies, the real niggas riot like Cali
We live in (Brownsville New York) where we hop the train
Cock Diesel niggas screamin out pop my chain
We screamin (Brownsville)

[Roscoe (???)]
Don't get your chain snatched
Where you from fool? You better bang that
When you come to (Brownsville), yeah, we don't care
Put your squad in the air, Master Fuol, finna act a fool

[Chorus]

[Interlude: Roscoe (Master Fuol)]
Yeah, YA, we doin it big, now put your hands up
Now put your squads up, now put your hands up
Now put your squds up, now put your hands up
Now put your hands up (Brownsville)

[Master Fuol (???)]
(Brownsville) Still duckin the deez
Got chicks screamin 'Why you got a gun in your jeans?'
I'm gonna be what I'm gonna be, and cops is on to me
Hot like the suana be, like corner be on Florence and Normandy
Cuz I was born to be a superstar
Kick a little game and scoop the broad
Kiss on the neck, lose the bra
Sippin on Saki in a sushi bar
Fully armed, things I don't blaze on, put the cape on, niggas, they gone
(Brownsville) I hit that bom bom, stuffed with crondon
Fully armed, things I don't blaze on, put the cape on, niggas, they gone
(Brownsville) I put my spurs on, and it's on
Ain't no stoppn us, and ain't no knockin us
And ain't no blockin us, we keep it, keep it, keep it poppin up in

[Chorus]</pre>
