[Intro: Young Brooklyn]
I just stepped in (It's Gutter Muzik)
I just exit, it's Gutter Muzik, nigga
My nigga Gutter, my nigga P
56 baby, check it

[Young Brooklyn]
Yo, I'ma roll that shit, I'ma light that shit
I'ma smoke that shit, and I ain't never gon' pass it
Yo, I'm gon' roll that shit, I'm gon' light that shit
I'ma smoke that shit, and I ain't never gon' pass it
We smoke berries like we in Hawaii, I done told you
Now it's 'bout time, that I show you
How we blaze haze in the big truck, the CLKs
Why these dudes playin' games in these last days?
Fuck that, boy, just pass that haze
'Fore I pass 'round ya way, and blast my K's
And you won't survive, another motherfuckin' day
All ya brother and ya mother will pray
Yo, check the clock, it's a quarter to eight
I'm sittin' in a corner to eight
You food if you'se a goner on my plate
Brooklyn, out of town, out of state
Bullets'll swarm, the informer, soon as he hits the gate (Gate bubble)
Fuck that shit, yeah (Bo King, B.V.I.)
We gon' roll that shit, and ain't gon' never pass that shit (Live
niggaz, real live)
Aiyo, I slap niggaz many ways, throw my hoodie on
Blaze an L of purple haze, you out of time in these last days
My eyes stay open like the dollar bill
Five cents to five mil, you tell me how real is real?
Fuck kingdom is fuckin' fucked up, who cares?
We all hungry, don't share, so watch yo' step in here
And you best beware, that that vest get teared
So rock a helmet too, niggaz, I'm tellin' you
It's the operation, attack and rush like Maximus
Gettin' smacked to dust when my cannons bust
Want more cheese than cameras, takin' pictures
Slap the face of bitches, one head and two faces
My crew laces, 56, never do aces
Uh, yeah, B.V.I., Bo King on the track, nigga (B.V.I., look live)
Y.B.K., boy, yeah, that's how we doin' it

[Timbo King]
Yeah, the family, Bo, Brook, Gutter, Self City, Fuzz, yeah
Angel of light, Jesus, rebel of rage
I was born inside Sin City, valley of strays
Hand-hustlin', we get paid, a thousand ways
Major League fitted, black greys, blood on my pays
So the fam cursed, why deceivers wanna stunt my growth?
Hopes and dreams is flooded by coke, from John Pope
Let us feast, I pray to God, my goal to keep
If I, get high before you snake, I'm lettin' off the .38
The pearl handle, Pearly Gates, for goodness sake
Ain't no hood is safe, ain't no hood is safe
Death on the corner, little shorty left on the corner
D's harass, OG's squeeze and blast
Dearly beloved, you love it, we thug it
B.V.I., live rap, yeah
Bo, Brook, Self, Gutter, City, 56, F.T. Knox.. (ya hear that?)</pre>
