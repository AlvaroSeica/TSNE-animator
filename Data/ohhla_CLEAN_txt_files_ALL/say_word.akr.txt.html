Yo, yo..

[Chorus: Akrobatik]
Now if you lovin hip-hop say yes {"Yes, yes!"}
And if you feelin hip-hop say word {"Say word"}
Say word if you love it when a nigga grab the mic
and kick some shit that you was glad you heard
{"Worrrrrrd up!"}
Now if you lovin hip-hop say word {"Say word"}
And if you feelin hip-hop say yes {"Yes!"}
Say yes if you love it when a nigga grab the mic
and everytime he do the shit sound fresh
{"Yes!"}
 
[Akrobatik]
Yo, I must initiate, lyrical inertia
The type that'll coerce ya, to elevate your shit
I devestate your situation, build and destroy
When it comes to Satan, I kill and enjoy
I chill and employ the tactics,
of stretchin MC's minds like prophylactics
Turn methods of meaning intergalactic
Right now, they think too locally
So when they grab the steel they tend to bullshit vocally
Old school like rotary phones and roto-rooter
but still I got the vision for the future (aight?)
Yo, I shoot to fill heads dreads or otherwise
Check it as this brother rise over these other guys
who smother lies all in your face - FUCK DAT!
I'm bringin skills back to where the previous sucked at
No time for slackin durin the verbal slaughter
The sharks swim the other way when I'm in the water

[Chorus: Akrobatik]
So if you lovin hip-hop say word {"Word!"}
And if you feelin hip-hop say yes {"Yes!"}
Say yes if you love it when a nigga grab the mic
and everytime he do the shit sound fresh
{"Yes!"}
Now if you lovin hip-hop say yes {"Yes!"}
And if you feelin hip-hop say word {"Say word"}
Say word if you love it when a nigga grab the mic
and kick some shit that you was glad you heard
{"Word!"}

No shit, now check it out..
{"Come on an', come on an' just.."}
{"Come on an', come on an' just.."}

[Akrobatik]
Yo, the outcome's already determined
This joint is burnin whoever it's concernin so start learnin
For this type of shit, hip-hop fans is yearnin
As the world keeps turnin respect I keep earnin
Sendin sonic waves to the globe's four corners
Reachin happy carefree kids to war mourners
Supporter of the cause to uplift the craft
so the average MC can't fuck with the half
The illest scientist can't fuck with the math
of the rugged block avenger on a mission like Shaft
Yo, you can check the graphs statistics and percentages
They all say that Akrobatik's style is what vintage is
Breakin down intergers to fractions
Brothers hear the facts then ask when Akrobatik's comin back in
No time for slackin durin the verbal slaughter
The current swims the other way when I'm in the water

[Chorus: Akrobatik]
Now if you lovin hip-hop say yes {"Yes!"}
And if you feelin hip-hop say word {"Say word"}
Say word if you love it when a nigga grab the mic
and kick some shit that you was glad you heard
{"Worrrrrrd up!"}
Now if you lovin hip-hop say word {"Say word"}
And if you feelin hip-hop say yes {"Yes, yes!"}
Say yes if you love it when a nigga grab the mic
and everytime he do the shit sound fresh
{"Yes!"}

{"Yes!"} {"Word!"} {"Worrrrrrd up!"}
{"Yes!"} {"Word!"} {"Worrrrrrd up!"}

[Akrobatik]
Yo yo, say yes, say word
Say yes, say word
Yo, the shit is absurd
Yo, yo yo..</pre>
