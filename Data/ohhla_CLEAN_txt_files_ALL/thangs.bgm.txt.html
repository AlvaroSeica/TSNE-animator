[ CHORUS: Pimp C ]
Fly hoes and chains and swangin thangs
Just another young nigga havin thangs, mayn

[ VERSE 1 ]
Time brings change and change comes with time
Throughout these years I learned to get down for mine
Had to do some crime with the attitude of not givin a fuck
Born with no luck, refuse to stay stuck
I made the bucks, did what I had to, I did what I could
My rise to the top was no surprise cause I knew that I would
Make it, oh, the chance, I had to take it
Fake it never because that nigga was too clever
If there ever was a muthafucka down for his crown
It had to be me, the B-i-g M-i-k-e, straight gee
Come sun down, come sun up, gun up
For them niggas who wanna run up
Whatchamacallit came up short, that nigga done what?
Fool, this big black nigga don't go for no losses
I had to get rid of my runner, so I recruited more horses
Down with neighborhood bosses, I made a connection and rose
Later for Eldo's and Vogue's, I just kick back and stack rolls and hoes

[ CHORUS: Pimp C ]

[ VERSE 2 ]
Times are changin, I'm livin my life in and out the do', black
Loungin here and there, somethin screamin in my ear, "Michael go back
Home," but I ain't really sho', black
I gots to get my shit togethter the right way, nigga, I know that
Comin up short swangin by the tail and
Thinkin of a masterplan, this nigga's bailin
Down the road, and I promised not to look back
At what I once had, what I have now, what I left and what I once took, black
Shook that, now I'm in my own realm
Controllin shit, kickin it, never knew life could be so damn
Well, I got mine, everything fell in line
Time brought change and change came with time

[ CHORUS: Pimp C ]

[ VERSE 3 ]
Lock another nigga up, throw away the fuckin key
That's the way they punish me, muthafuck society
I could spend a century in the penitentiary
It won't make a difference, gee, cause ain't nobody missin me
Round and round and round we go, a different day, a different face
Damn, I wish I could run away, I hate this muthafuckin place
Too many goddamn rules, that's why I quit school
Givin me a crooked test, I ain't no damn fool
Can't walk out my house because they always in my face
And if I step outta place they wanna give me a case
Ain't no difference between society and the jailhouse
Everybody's locked up and wanna get the hell out
Just cause you ain't locked down you think you got it good
But you better think again
Cause the police are checkin niggas in the neighborhood
Beatin our ass down
Cause society is just like the pen, so get ready for the lockdown
Clock now while you can, man
Huh, cause it's all about havin thangs 
And I'ma get mine, fool
Time brought change and change came with time
