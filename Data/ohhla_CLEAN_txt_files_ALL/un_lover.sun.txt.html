Yeah baby, you lookin lovely, very lovely
You know your man should appreciate you the way that I do
and my girl, she should appreciate me the way that you do, baby
But they have yet to understand one thing:

[ VERSE 1: King Sun ]
You are truly my undercover lover
Sharing a secret life so undiscovered
I sneak to meet such a girl so sweet
As we make love between satin sheets
The time we spend as nothing more than friends
You see me with my girl, I wink and you grin
We can't be together or showing a sign
Because you're with your man but I'm on your mind
Some say it's wrong to be so discrete
The way we meet and go some place to eat
I wine you and dine you and hold your hand
Baby, your wish is indeed my command
A wonderful time we have sitting and talking
Or even down by the pier just walking
Then we depart our little rendez-vous
It's nice to have an undercover like you

[ CHORUS ]
Undercover lover
come into my life and brighten up my day
(Undercover, my lover, I love you)
Undercover lover
come into my life and chase my fears away
(Undercover, my lover, I love you)

[ VERSE 2: King Sun ]
When you need someone close you can talk to
Then you call me, you just ought to
Know I like listening to you and your speaking
Half original, lovely Puerto-Rican
Just the type of girl I like keeping
I wonder if I say your name while I'm sleeping
That could cause a great bit of fight
So I stay awake and think about you at night
Sometimes I think my girl suspects something
She tries to diss you by calling you a dumb thing
I speak on your behalf, play it off and laugh
Go out to the phone booth and call you from the ave.
Arrange it to see you, hold you and love you
A dozen of roses shows I'm thinking of you
Don't get me wrong, I love her too
But it's nice to have an undercover like you

[ CHORUS ]

( *phone conversation* )
(Hello?)
Yeah, what's happenin, sweetness
(Hello)
I'ma try to get you a little later, right?
(Okay)
Alright
I love you
(I love you too, Sun)

[ VERSE 3: King Sun ]
The day goes by when I need to rely
On a dissollute relationship that you and I
Started as friends, extended and then 
A kiss led to more, we decided to pretend
Nothing is wrong cause there's nothing between us
People started rumors from the time they've seen us
Holding hands, smiling at each other
Even though we pass for sister and brother
A certain part of you belongs to me
The part that is soft, tender and sweet
That starts from the beautiful hair on your head
On down to the pretty little toes on your feet
Love me tender, female agenda
To your secret love I surrender
If there's one thing she's yet to discover
It's you, my beauttiful undercover lover

Hey love
it might be wrong, what we doing and everything
but what they don't know won't hurt em at all

[ CHORUS ]

( *phone conversation* )
Yeah baby
Uhm, I can't you see you no more, the heat is on
(But Sun, I left him for you
You left him for me?
You buggin out
(It is your baby I'm carrying)
My baby?
Ah come on now, I ain't even tryina to hear that
(Well, you better try to hear this:
if I can't have you, nobody can)

...damn!</pre>
