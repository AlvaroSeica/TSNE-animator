NASA: "Three minutes forty five seconds and counting
We're full go at this time"

[Frank Ocean]
Listenin to, Star Trak's star tracks
On the track to stars and back
Only after we get to the end
Passin planets feelin small
On the mattress floatin off
How you breathin up here with nothin on
Nothin on, baby girl, but

[Chorus]
You look good in your/that spacesuit
I can't keep my hands off you
Plus it's easy to love you
Oh, up here, up here
I'm a take it slow, slow
While the rockets burn, they burnin
We'll be makin love, baby
Rocket love, rocket love ooh

{"Two minutes ten seconds and counting"}

[Frank Ocean]
The candle's burnin in the sun
We don't need them but you like them
They glow they glow, oh yeah
We were, at the bar for quite a while
Took some time but we collided
Big bang, big bang, look at what we made beautiful

[Chorus]

[Frank Ocean]
We can make believe that we're up there
But we're only in the backseat, of this Eclipse ohh
If the lights go by, that means the cops flew by
But they won't bother us, no no no no

[Chorus] - second half, 2X

[NASA Outro]
Twenty seconds and counting
Fifteen seconds and counting
Twelve, eleven, ten, nine, ignition sequence starts
Six, five, four, three, two, one, zero
All engines running
Liftoff! We have a liftoff! </pre>
