[Travie McCoy]
Baby girl, we ain't got to move too fast
First and foremost I'm a gentlemen with class
Not the least bit concerned with what happened in your past
And I'm sure your heart's hurtin but the pain won't last
I can be your aspirin, an aspirin I be
We start you with a daily dose of vitamin me
Yeah I got jokes, you laughin at them though
Now go on and grab your coat and tell your girls that you leavin 'em
Show me baby (show me baby)
What you got (what you got)
Show me baby (show me baby)
Your favorite spot (your favorite spot)
And I can take, you out of here
Can put your love, in the atmosphere
Show me what you want and I got that
Tell me what you need and you got that
(I wanna make her press that ass on me)
Before we get to that

[Chorus: The-Dream]
It starts with kissin ears
Making babies, buy you a Mercedes girl
It starts with kissin ears
Getting married, bein willin to share it girl
It starts with kissin ears
Get to know me, pickin up groceries girl
It starts with kissin ears
Payin the bills, givin ya thrills
It starts with kissin ears {*3X*}
Now let me kiss you on your hot spot

[Travie McCoy]
Far be it from me to kiss you on the first date
But our lips are like Legos and it's gettin kind of late
You don't gotta eat the bait, all I want is a chance
The fish are gettin nervous cause the pond is dryin fast
You lyin if you say I'm the type of guy you're used to
Hilltop suite in St. Lucia
Expose your ears so I could kiss you, or maybe just whisper
somethin real mannish - you ain't know I knew Spanish didja?
Show me what you want and I got that
Tell me what you need and you got that
Say the word it's over, security like a soldier
Before we get to that

[Chorus]

[The-Dream] + (Travie)
All night long? (All night long)
Can you sing my song? (Can you sing my song)
We can start right here
Sex, starts with kissin ears
(Show me what you want and I got that)
Kissin ears (ha ha ha ha, you know I got that)
Kissin ears (yeah, you know I got that)
(Them other dudes; please, you know I'm not that)

[Chorus]

[Travie McCoy]
Show me what you want and I got that
Tell me what you need and you got that
Say the word it's over, security like a soldier
Before we get to that it starts with kissin ears
Show me what you want and I got that
Ha ha ha ha, you know I got that
Yeah, you know I got that
Them other dudes; please, you know I'm not that</pre>
