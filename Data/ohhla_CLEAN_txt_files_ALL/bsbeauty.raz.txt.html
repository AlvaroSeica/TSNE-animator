[Intro: Hell Razah]
YouknowI'msayin?
We send this one
This be like.. this a letter right here
YouknowI'msayin?
To the black sleeping beauty

[Chorus 3.5X: Hell Razah]
Black sleeping beauty, need love truly
Gotta teach our women, and our seed that's our duty

[Hell Razah]
Black family love
Black sleeping beauty, bagged after movies
Before I gave her a call for a booty
I just dropped jewellry, cutie seemed moody
Ruled by emotions, like love slow motion
Fine sand by the ocean, get niggas open
Then leave the ass flat broken
For a million dollar token, she left his ass heart broken
She was fuckin with that other nigga too
She need a little love from a god-body hub'
Most kings and queens now fiend out on drug, uh-huh
My brown Cleopatra, look through your bible chapters
She's left with the pasta, now you got an Acura
After spectacular, pretty Ms. Dracula
Life is unruley, sincerely, yours truly
Ya under anastesia, my black sleeping beauty

[Chorus 1.5X]

[Hell Razah]
She need a little love from a god-body hub
Black sleeping beauty, need love truly

[Killah Priest]
I saw her sleep-walking, headed for abortion
Place to put a offspring, home of the coffin
Claims she keeps it real, swallowed sleeping pills
Watching Jenny Jones about the pity that she owns
Gave her plenty stones, mostly in the dome
Saw her roll her eyes, goin out with older guys
Saw 'em holdin lies, cuz she wants to cry
They got her under arms, sayin, "Here, watch the charm"
Tryin to wake up, but she stops her alarms
Head is in inflatin, we got our education
Went to bed with Satan, and never awaken
It's heartbreakin, so you in the park shaking
What spell is this? Went from delicate, in to deralict
Inhale, you sick, you wanna live lavish, house up in Paris
Head like a cabbage, nothing in your cabinet

[Chorus 1.5X]

[Hell Razah]
She need a little love from a god-body hub
You was poutin when you was diamond rockless
We had the his and her Guess watches
Before Versaci's, you had a profit
Plus an apartment in the projects
I gave you money for your pockets
Switch the topic, the modern days
We still got pictures, in your langeries
We cut school just for matinees
Now you old to drink Tax's J and other champagnes
You go to clubs and campaign, and lie about your man's name
Just to get some damn fame, playin game
Those who weak, and never use their game
A net, where's your network?
Guess skirts, or Polo sweatshirts, the truth hurts
It leaves your heart broken, I had you open
When you was fine token, walk in the streets
Now you play passenger seats, in Lex jeeps
Actin like your ass can't speak
You black sleep-ing beauty
You black sleep-ing beauty

[Chorus 1.5X]

[Outro: Hell Razah]
YouknowI'msayin?
For the black queen
YouknowI'msayin?
You make an army, or you could break an army?</pre>
