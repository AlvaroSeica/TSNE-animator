Yo, a summer day bright, forecast, the sunshine's right
Not one cloud in sight, to damper our night
I exit BC, to meet at the DE
Here comes BD, in the Camaro Z
Twenty eight days left until school starts
Run down the street, for treats at the mart
Damn, kid, can't imagine you're going to FL
I'll miss you, hope all goes well
Yessir, what's the next event to occur?
Cruise night down the Hutchinson, I concur
Yeah, kid, we know how the night be
Girls coming from over the bridge, put on fresh Nike
We could bleach, sunrays at the beach
Or go to E Town, listening to the tires screech
It's just one day in my summer
Eighty dollars at the pump to fill up that Hummer, what a bummer
It's crazy, kid with the SRT be mad lazy
M.I.A., comes out when the skies are gray
G-Ray, spaz out, make the whole crowd giggle
Others, be calmer than a funeral vigil
D &amp; C Boogie, straight out a romance movie
It's all good, who needs new booty?
Forget the roads, I'm going off, you feel me?
Yeah, that's for you, man, my man, Feelie
No homo, though, you'll keep my life moving
Ya'll at my back, there's no chance of losing
Grey ghost, the rumble of the, cargo
Plus hit his tranny, cuz, the car is slow
Hard work, but it maintains the fun
One love to you, and your fam, Tom Dunn
White Plains, New York, grew up and raised
If you see one day in my summer, you'll be amazed
Milkshakes from Carvel, make it swell
The car wax on the paint make a nice smell
Animes every night to relax my nerves
Check out the summer girls, the body curves
Put aside the tragedies, all over the globe
Relax, sit back and have Kool-Aid, in your robe
Then it's back on weekday at Citgo
It's a cycle, you know, how that shit go
Mouse here forever, that's how the hit go

[Interlude: Li-Mouse (Cno Evil)]
That's real (that's how it go, homey)
That's right, man, that's all it
(I like how you tell that little story, right there)
Yeah, yo (Makes me reminisce on the summer)
Yo, reminisce that, man (makes me reflect)
Reflect, word (yeah)

[Cno Evil]
Reflect on this, like a mirror image, until it's finished
Bulk up my rhymes, like Popeye does with the spinach
I pop lines that spark rhymes and jump start beats
Blast it in your four-doors, convertibles and your Jeeps
Ride out, insert my disc, as the other one slides out
Roll down your window, line it up and let it fly out
Then reverse your automobile, and back up
Repeat til necessary, until it cracks up, crack-crack
I crack myself up with the disaster, no laughter
Leave the world shocked like The Day After
Tomorrow, the sorrow and the sun will never come out
Tomorrow, I borrow that mic from you, you dumb mouth
Saying stupid shit, you need to quit and retire
You think I'm the liar, who's the one swimming in the fire
I plug the paper with ink, leave your parental advised
Way too vivid for your eyes
Your G rated rhymes, stay in the matinee
Mines NC-17, and well worth your pay
Your admission? My transmition, is a transition
Can't stand the heat? Well get the fuck out the kitchen
Like walkie-talkie, my tongue flips back like hockey
Back and forth, two-ways, while the third rail shocks me
Electrifying, death defying, Cno EVil Knieval
Yeah, you heard it, I'm unbelievable
I strike down with my mic, like an arm and hammer
No baking soda, premium pure like Tropicana
Get split like the banana ice cream cones
You want more of the sugar sweeted coated Love Jones?
I cop me a pack of Big Red, a bottle of Pepsi Twist
Abraham Linc', my change is three dollars and four cents
Here's a penny, so, give me back a nickel
The bitch told me to shave off my beard, cuz it tickles her
Fuck this, I'm about to just, drop my pen
I look at my paper, there's it, writing again
I just can't stop, it's like a monster within
Other MC's be MIA like a Dolphin
You be vegetarian, you don't want no beef
So don't order what you can't eat, it'll break your teeth
Won't even chew no more, bitch, hit the door
What you waiting for? Domestic Violence Part 3 and Part 4?
Double the trouble, hocus pocus, abracadabra
Psycho shit, after the tears comes the laughter
Producers beats snap, crackle, and pop, call 'em Rice Krispies
They don't come back like frisbees
When I go on tour, please don't miss me
Pussies be sniffing catnip, be getting frisky
I got this girl, I call her Ketchup, sometimes
Cuz I put her upside down and tap her hard on her behind

[Outro: Cno Evil (Li-Mouse)]
Yeah (word, man) Rodentz (Rodentz, comin' atcha, man, it's all I'm talking about)
(It's that summer) Summer 2005
(It's that one summer day of my life, man, damn, wish it would happen all the time)
The heat outside (word, mad hot, outside) Break a sweat (break a sweat, all the time)
(Yo, you know that man, this shit is just hot outside, humid and sticky)

We only make it hotter (We only make) Rodentz (The Rodentz) Order Rodentia
