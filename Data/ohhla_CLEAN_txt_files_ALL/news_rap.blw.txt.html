[Kurtis Blow]
This is Kurtis Blow, with the latest trend
You got to know what's out, and what's in
Talkin 'bout the taste, the one that's right
(Now more than ever it's) SPRITE!
Lemon taste, and lime taste
Great Lymon taste is TOUGH!
Without Lymon, it's not happening (so sorry, 7Up!)
N-N-Now that's the trend, so tell it to a friend
We're chillin out with the taste that's in
Now, more than EVEEEEER~!
(Now more than ever) IT'S SPRITE!!
