"City of angels..."
"Spread your wiiiiings, for me"

[Random]
Another day, in the city (in the city) of angels...
It's 5 A.M., my city is just wakin
Eyes barely parted by the smell of cooked bacon
Opened up my eyes, and opened up the blinds
Ready for a new day and the challenges I'm facin
What can I say about the city I live in?
It's full of any-town, cause it's full of heroes and villains
Good seeds, bad seeds, most of 'em is in between
But the similarities in 'em, that's the difference
Pray for the wisdom to make the right decisions
It's like a broken hand on the clock of life
Cause you never know, you might get shot tonight
So I teach and rock the mic
It sound like day and night 'til shorty unlock the light
Gotta stand up in front of a child that's been jaded
by the lies he been told, that there's no need to make it
in a society that don't want to see him succeed
While everybody around's doin devilish deeds
If it don't bury me, it makes me strong
enough to take this on, let me take you on
through the city of angels, the city of angels
We all in the web and some don't wanna get untangled
Hotter than the barbecue, it takes away the part of you
Non-believers come through and it'll put the fear of God in you
Don't let 'em get'cha, chef whippin up an art mixture
Flood of cigarettes and hard liquor
and bar-bi-tu-ates as long as God's wit'cha
You at the apex, and it's a safe bet
that if you doin right the Devil WILL try to tar'get'cha
We a a nation at war; yeah we take resources and take 'em abroad
Every day I record
more, tryin not to stay away from the throne
The black sheep stray from the flock and labelled they own
Thinkin they makin it home, but gravely mistaken
The way I see the people change it's amazin
Everybody on their way to get paid
Chasin an escape but really chasin the grave
Prayin for the day that the son confesses
that you all God's, just like His son suggested
City of angels, we love those things
But nobody here was taught, how to work they wings
Dr. Drew on the 1-2, rehabilitatin minds
In these last day and times, I ain't just sayin rhymes
Literally take 'em to school
With a promise, but not the 40 acres and mule
Somethin that's honest - I seen a lot of cats fall from grace
Roll snake eyes, prayin for the larger stakes
But in the pen, three strikes you in
Livin a life full of sin right to the end
Got stuck for weeks now I'm writin again
Sharpen it up and take a pen to you snakes
who permeate my city, with all the envy and hate
I know I can't save 'em all, but while I'm here
I bring the truth to whoever's in earshot
Every brother lettin a tear drop cause he got no career plot
Everybody's stuck in drive but the gears locked
It's the city, the city, the city, of angels

"Spread your wiiiiings, for me"
"City of angels..."
"Spread your wiiiiings, for me"
