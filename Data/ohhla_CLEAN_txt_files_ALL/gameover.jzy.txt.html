Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
I said the game the game yea it's over it's over
and don't forget to tell 'em that I told ya
I said the game the game yea it's over it's over
and don't forget to tell 'em that I told ya

[Verse 1]
said I'm going in shawty I got this little niggaz
I'm lighting mama babys daddy I'm doubt these little niggaz
still acting like they in or out these little niggaz
I survived many magic in my house these little niggaz
see I ain't tryin to brag I ain't tryin to boast
and since we talking that guess who sold the most
yea damn right not even close
I'm the type of nigga to re-up could buy a boat
and when I say boat just so I meant a yacht
we talking about those cars just know that I got alot
yea no nigga just know I got a alot
I'm a trampolines nigga just know I flip before I flop

[Chorus]
I said the game the game yea it's over it's over
and don't forget to tell 'em that I told ya
I said the game the game yea it's over it's over
and don't forget to tell 'em that I told ya

[Verse 2]
they ask me why do I never stress cause I'm the best
hello world you're rocking with young so fuck the rest
my aunty mother let me borrow a kiss and I never miss ?
she always used to clean up behind me love her to death
I used too busy off on the block with the crackheads
I rather do that then sleep in a packed bed
talking about so much pee stains wish I was dead
wish I could sleep aside this bitch wish I was ten
you don't know that my nigga I'm bumpin that slick daddy
thinking how could get my son the rich daddy
I could sell me some dope I'm writing some dope thrines
and that's how you kill some birds with one dime

[Chorus]
I said the game the game yea it's over it's over
and don't forget to tell 'em that I told ya
I said the game the game yea it's over it's over
and don't forget to tell 'em that I told ya

[Verse 3]
I'm in the a-town fitted that's blue with the red benz
I'm a holla tips with me just and him just us in the black ?
I got them martin lawerence stones in my ear them bring 'em streets
last time I looked down I was buyig for two weeks
I was once the mvp in the triple beam team
and push the lamborghini that's listerine green
what the fresh that bitch was clean
mustve sucked from a little pms that bitch was mean

[Chorus]
I said the game the game yea it's over it's over
and don't forget to tell 'em that I told ya
I said the game the game yea it's over it's over
and don't forget to tell 'em that I told ya

let's go!</pre>
