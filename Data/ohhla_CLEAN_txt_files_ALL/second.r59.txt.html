Nickel... tell 'em what it is

[Royce Da 5'9"]
This (this) is (is) a world (a world) {"P-P-P-P-P-Premier Premier"}
A world {"Premier, Premier, Premier, P-P-P-P-Premier Premier"}

Look, I'm in the zone for realer
In a freezer with Medusa I'm fuckin a stone cold killer
Your bitch vibin, I'm inside her, now tell your kids this
Daddy's been doin more +Dick+ ridin than Kari Wigton
I'm very venomous, you very innocent
And I will send a MONSTER to your house, call him Harry Henderson
Oh, my, God; I was just in jail
Then the devil caught pneumonia, and it made me sick as hell
You niggaz countin me out, can get the riches still
You're all in the +The Matrix+, shoulda picked a different pill
You about to see how far that Paul Rosenberg'll go
The height of my game is like a DeMar 'Rozan vertical
No one understands me
Only one sicker than me is Em, I'm the new +D MC+, it +Runs+ in the family

[Interlude]
"Man why that nigga gotta bring Em name up all the time?
Man that nigga wouldn't even be rich without that nigga."
{*smack*} Shut up faggot

[Chorus: Royce]
I come to embarrass y'all rappers, I should run a marathon backwards
So I can see what second place look like, look
{"T-too many sick niggaz, Nickel bring the remedy"}
{*scratched*: "Make it real clear!"}
I come to embarrass y'all rappers, I should run a marathon backwards
So I can see what second place look like, look
{*scratched*: "You not ready for the raw deal, it's all real"}
{"Kiss the ring, begone!"}

[Royce Da 5'9"]
I'm the magnificent with the sensational style
My wedding with the streets got the cake with no vows
I'm arrogant as fuck, who cares? You suck
Rappers talkin 'bout "We the best" done been to Paris too much
Who hot? Who sick? Shit, I'm like a Theraflu slush
Y'all ain't fly, y'all fallin slow with the parachute up, up
I'm a face-slapper; niggaz sleepin on an outfit
Call us Taylor Gang 'cept we Wake-n-Bake rappers
Slaughter Yelawolf responsible for haters' actions
Y'all on Gilligan's Island, find a greater Captain
Hahaha, haha, victory laugh
Even my photographer's happy, picture me mad
I feel will, your bitch suck my dick
I nutted on the floor and left her standin there cryin over spilled milk..
{*imitates sobbing then laughs*}

[Chorus]

[Royce Da 5'9"]
My swing's like chains on a playground
I bust fly plus I'm about to put some wings on a Greyhound
Uh, my theory of, you is you lie and you drink beer
And I ain't hearin ya so you must be from Liberia
I wave bye like Hitler, 100-round thumper
Bulletproof WHAT? You gon' need an underground bunker
I ain't where you should go
I put my whole life on the 'net, even my weapons, I am Bazooka Joe
Uhh, we the shit, nigga eat a dick
We'll make him eat his words, we the stones, he the sticks
I'm going yellin "Shady" everywhere
Smackin niggaz bitches with they lipstick and they baby with they teddy bear
To you and your man, ain't gon' be no Talladega Night
I come to question y'all and y'all don't know what to do with your hands
Nickel Preme, killer team
Add a different dealer every day like a fickle fiend

[Chorus]</pre>
