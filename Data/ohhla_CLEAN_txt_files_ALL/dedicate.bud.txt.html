[Intro: Buddha Monk]
I was only nine years old, when daddy left me
Poppa was always up to no good
This one here is dedicated to a very special lady in my life
She's my M-O-M-M-Y, she's a very special woman
and dear mom, I dedicate this song to you

[Chorus x2: Unknown sampled singer]
This goes out to a special lady
The one that brought me life
The one that taught me right
She always held me tight

[Buddha Monk]
Hey moms, I dedicate this song to you
You're my M-O-M-M-Y, my special brew
I'ma bless you with diamonds and pearls, and rubies too
Well this is just something for the things you do
Momma soon, I'll take you on a real long cruise
Sit back with some class, champagne just for two
You're overdue, so here's some things meant for you
Benzes and minks, friends that you never knew
Private jets, year round trips to Tibet
Ah, you and Janet sand, singin that bangin-ass duet
Finished yet? Malik will pour you Moet
with hand to hand service as the sun sets
You never guessed, the life could ever be this best
Sit back, just relax, you ain't seen nothin yet
You're my girl, my mom and my first love too
That's why I dedicate this song right here to you
C'mon

[Chorus x2]

[Buddha Monk]
Hey moms, they should've made a statue for you
Best moms in the World, yea, baby that's you
You tried to prove, the good times went down the line
Didn't believe, now I'm infested with drug crime
In these hard times and I'm still out to get mines
A motivated soldier on the hands of time
Cops draw the line, now I'm facin seven to nine
And you're still tellin me it's gonna be alright
That's why I love you, no matter all the things I did
Yo, you still turn around and call me one of your kids
When poppa slide, how was you to deal with all of us kids?
Yea, a family of four with the governor's laws
No more, now it's time to take a World tour
Breath the fresh air, we smell the sea shore
I adore, and I want to give you applause
Dedicating this song to you once more
Cuz...

[Chorus x2]

[Outro: Buddha Monk]
Aiyyo, moms
Let me tell you one thing
I can't express the way that I feel
All the things that you've done for me
I was one of those bad-ass kids gettin up
every mornin, doin all the thug things
You know, I didn't get many whoopins
when I did get a whoopin, it hurt
but I still had to do what I had to do momma
cuz times was hard
and there was no father there for us
but I knoiw you loved me
and I know you'd forgive me for all things I did
but if you didn't, I hope this song finds you at your best 'partment
You're with me in my heart, I love you and you're my favorite girl
I get one, I only get one, I only get one
(You're my momma, yea) My momma
I love you, mother (yea, sweet old momma, yea)
Feel the road to the riches
and riches to the road
cuz I'm gonna leave and go somewhere you've never been before
You're my woman, and I'll always see you
(Don't you want me in this World?)
I always love you to death, momma
We out, baby, c'mon
(I'll always love my momma)
She's my only one!
(She's my favorite)
(And you only get one, you only get one)
Yea (one good girl)
I love you, hahaha
That's right momma (Ohhh.. ohhh.. ohhh)</pre>
