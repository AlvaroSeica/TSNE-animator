[Ark]       Everybody stand up!
            Fingazz
            T-Weaponz
            Let's
            Come on
            Yeah
            Whoo!
[Psalmz]    They can't fuck with us
[Ark]       Oh!
[Fingazz]   "Fingazz on the track"

[Verse 1: Psalmz]
Not in a million years, make this crystal clear, Mr. Pistelier
Never kissed a rear in his career to get a foot in here
You prayed that the boys dropped dead and the noise stop
Cause Dem Boyz stack bread like toy blocks
The hood's got to listen, poppa's missin', poppin' locks
With pocket pick, in our condition, clock was tickin', cops would knock
The pot, the pistol not the vision, stop ya wishin', drop and stomp
The competition, I don't give a cotton-pickin' fuck
(???) the hottest kitchens, cause the glock I'm livin's like a rock you livin'
Off the block you pitchin', I threw out the side you sittin' in
To prob on ditches, bitches, oh, we stop off pitches, bitches
As I stuck the richest bitches, now I got the bitches intrested

Break 1:
[T-Weaponz] There's not a gun that we don't pop
[Fingazz]   "Psalmz"
            "T-Weaponz" --&gt; Psalmz
[T-Weaponz] There ain't a show that we can't rock
[Fingazz]   "Turn it up, I can't hear you now" --&gt; Diamonique
[T-Weaponz] Til the top, man, we won't drop
[Fingazz]   "Brooklyn"
            "Brooklyn" --&gt; Psalmz
[T-Weaponz] It's T-Weaponz, homie, we won't stop
[Fingazz]   "East coast"
            "West coast" --&gt; Psalmz

[Verse 2: IzReal]
They still tryin' to figure me out
Stay on their mind so much
It's like we moved in and live in they house
They don't claim to have an ear on the street
But they so full of themselves
They don't realize what they hearin' is me
And the ones that know about us are so obnoxious
For my gift of gab got them askin' all about us
They know the flow is toxic
I'm not one to talk shit
Cause my hood only spoke in glock clips
T-Weaponz
The New York Rican east coast thugs
Where we still get Chicano, Latino love
Ya tu sabes
Without you, there be no us
No name in lights, Las Vegas, casino buzz
And we rep for the black and Latino slums
Cause no matter where I'm at
You gon' see those guns
And no matter who's next when we leave those clubs
The streets tell us
"He's aight, but he's no us"

Break 2:
[T-Weaponz] There's not a gun that we don't pop
[Fingazz]   "IzReal"
            "Cause everything I say is real" --&gt; IzReal
[T-Weaponz] There ain't a show that we can't rock
[Fingazz]   "T-Weaponz" --&gt; IzReal
[T-Weaponz] Til the top, man, we won't drop
[Fingazz]   "Brooklyn"
            "Brooklyn" --&gt; IzReal
[T-Weaponz] It's T-Weaponz, homie, we won't stop
[Fingazz]   "Turn it up"
            "Turn it up" --&gt; Diamonique

[Verse 3: Ark]
There's no fear in here, soldier
Y'all nothin' to scare over
So stand over there or get ran over
Hand over, my respects, producers
Damn over, the first time I ever rapped over
Is it too much to ask for a landrover
Plus a land of strip for choppers to land over
Word on the street, niggas eavesdroppin'
So what we speak when the beat knockin'
Fuck it, tell 'em keep watching
Since y'all are so concerned in learnin'
On burnin' determination, there be more than just the words in
The zap or the smokin', outspoke about
Every open mouth, you would see somethin' pokin' out there
That's my (???), got to bang Ayana
The (???) once my anger pop like I dropped the anchor
I'm that nigga who'll party til the crack of dawn
And still be back up on his feet at the crack of dawn

Break 3:
[T-Weaponz] There's not a gun that we don't pop
[Fingazz]   "It's Ark, cold man ch-ching" --&gt; Ark
[T-Weaponz] There ain't a show that we can't rock
[Fingazz]   "Brooklyn boys, Boriqua" --&gt; Ark
[T-Weaponz] Til the top, man, we won't drop
[Fingazz]   "T, T-Weaponz" --&gt; Ark
[T-Weaponz] It's T-Weaponz, homie, we won't stop
[Fingazz]   "East coast"
            "West coast" --&gt; Ark

[Psalmz]
Yeah!
Put your motherfuckin' hands up!
Stand up!
