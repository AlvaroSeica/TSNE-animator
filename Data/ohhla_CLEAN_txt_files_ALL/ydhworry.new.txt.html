Y'know...I just wanna make you dance...like uh....

[Missy Elliott]
I'll stay closer to your side, like a beeper
You Don't Have To Worry 'bout me, so you won't +Miss+ me like +Monifah+ (Heh, heh)
P-U-F-F, D-A-double D...Y
He be makin' hits like the old factory
And I...I "Hit You With Da Hee"
A Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-how
"Hit You Wit Da Hee"
This is how we get down, alright?
With Ronnie, Bobby, Johnny, Ricky, and Mike
(Well forget about Ralph!)
Owwww..

[Bobby Brown]
Lady, I know I've been acting strange
It seems to me you're tired of playing games
I've been around, had girls here and there
I did you wrong, but I'll give my life to make it right

[Chorus]
I know that things ain't right
Seems like all we do is fight (OWWW!!! Owwww!! owwww!)
And it's been on my mind
You Don't Have To Worry
I'm gonna make it right
I'll be on your side
No more lonely nights
You Don't Have To Worry

What must I do to make it up to you?
What can I say, to make you see things my way?
I know it's hard for you to understand
I did you wrong but I'll give my life to make it right

[Chorus]
I know that things ain't right
Seems like all we do is fight
And it's been on my mind
You Don't Have To Worry
I'm gonna make it right
I'll be on your side
No more lonely nights
You Don't Have To Worry

Don't be afraid
I'll be there whenever you need me
I'll be there trust in me
Just call on me
I won't let you down...ohhhh..

[Michael Bivins]
NE expertise please
Here to put the squeeze on the industry fleas
Getting cheese, peep these, butter slurs, his &amp; hers
Chinchilla furs, check the Goodfella words
You don't ever have to worry
Cause I get in ya like Murray
And boo, it's only a tight flurry
You're frontin' cattin', you wanna rumble in the satin
In a bad ass suite somewhere in lower Manhattan

[Ron DeVoe]
I'm from the street too but I gotta eat to
Won't hesitate to eat you, other than that "glad to meet you"
I spend nights in the Ramada, my honey's stay laced in Escada
Chickens is mad that I got her
Casino style gambino types smile
Kiss you before I twist you, all the wax is official
Players' on the set gettin' wet
Sippin' Perrier Jouet, so you don't even have to worry, yet

[Chorus]
I know that things ain't right
Seems like all we do is fight (OWWW!!! Owwww!! owwww!)
And it's been on my mind
You Don't Have To Worry
I'm gonna make it right
I'll be on your side
No more lonely nights
You Don't Have To Worry</pre>
