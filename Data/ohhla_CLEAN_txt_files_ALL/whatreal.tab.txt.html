[Chorus: Talib Kweli]
What's real? Do you know?
What's real? Let me show y'all
What's real? Do you know?
What's real? Let me show y'all
What's real? (What's real?) Do you know? (Do you know?)
What's real? (What's real?) Let me show y'all (show y'all)
What's real? (What's real?) Do you know? (Do you know?)
What's real? (What's real?) Let me show y'all

[Talib Kweli]
Hey, hey, hey
I'ma start this story, my influence so enormous
Got that shit you love to sing along with, like every line is the chorus
I'm born in Brooklyn like Biggie, I'm born in Brooklyn like Jordan
I'm born in Brooklyn like Tyson, you don't live this, you just a tourist
We ride or die for them corners, fuck yo' private life, they spy on us
When they catch us man it's like practice for the new tactics that they try on us
Them cops are linin them coffins, why we get shot we lyin in coffins
They want my demise cause when I arrive they stop for lines so often
Nigga just stop, you might as well forfeit, we like Shia LaBeouf and so +Lawless+
Steel recognize steel, real recognize real, like the car I'm drivin you foreign
My diamond cut is so flawless, no not jewels I'm talkin 'bout soft bitch
So if they after me like I'm Lauryn, I just tell the feds that I'm Moorish
... We walkin, all the girls is talkin
Generally they butt-fuckin naked just like "The Book of Mormon"
We see the trees for them forests, my name ring them bells like a doorman
Y'all niggaz game is so corny, that's why you grill them hoes just like Forman, boring

[Chorus] w/ Res ad libs

[Talib Kweli]
Paper chasin we on that grind, reputation, on the line
Crazy, borderline; pay me, on time
Crazy, borderline; pay me, on time
Crazy, borderline; pay me, on time
Explore and discover what most fear, I will never wait 'til the brush clear
Swear I will never get stuck here, America, fuck yeah
Measure my career in dog years, my past four got them dog ears
I set sail, travellin the world like Jesus was doin in his lost years
I might give you the pill like Morpheus, I'm like the P.E. logo in the crosshairs
Standin out cause there's nothin but whores here, pimps rock crocodile like false tears
Bring it on through your force field, I'll be givin you nothin but the raw deal
What I say on display is the purest skill, I'll be givin y'all niggaz what's more real
What's more real, what's more real? I got chicks fightin like floor sales
You gossipy bloggers all fail, like at the yardstick I'm measurin your tall tales
And you all fall short, you small scale, all in between the legs like a dog's tail
You are what you eat, you don't want no beef, you completely vegan like all kale

[Chorus] - performed by Res w/ ad libs

[Outro: Res]
What's real? (What's real?) Do you know? (Do you know?)
What's real? (What's real?) Let me show y'all (let me show y'all)
What's real? (What's real?) Do you know? (Do you know?)
What's real? (What's real?) Let me show y'all (let me show y'all)
