Ohh it can't be
G.O.O.D. music, my Grammy family
Used to bump the demo up out of the Camry
Now I'm hoppin out the limo or either the Lam-B
But you niggaz gon' get in 'til you get to Miami
GLC gon' be Stone'd as Angie
I be Don C., Johnny Patron and me
It's a celebration bitches, more bottles of cham-p-aign
In love with the same stripper that +Sprung+ T-Pain
And all this Loius Vuitton shit ain't cheap, mayne
Dawg I can't keep, sayin
G.O.O.D. music, the greatest latest
Stuntin out the middle of nowhere like Vegas
From the Chi, the city of hella haters
Where we keep risin to the top like elevators
Hi haters, I'm back off hiatus
I feel just like you, I mean even I hate us
Turn the radio down, I mean every song
Yeezy got a vision that's clearer than Evian
Used to hit the radio, them faggots ain't let me on
Until Khaled turned up the volume
Hit the club wit it, c'mon homie they whylin
Nas done told you, c'mon homie "We Major"
Really Doe done told you hoes where we stayin
G.O.O.D. music up in this bitch now quit playin
(Ohh ohh ohhhhh) Dawg it can't be
G.O.O.D. music, the Grammy family
A little bit of somethin flickin dawg it ain't deep
I'm only tryin to spend what they claim you can't keep
Before you die so I make sure I (ohh ohh ohhhhh)
stay on the Southside like Lakeshore Drive (la-la la la la-lahhh)
The Grammy family (la-la la la la-lahhh)
 
[Consequence] + (John Legend)
Uh, uh, uh (la-la la la la-la)
Geah, uh, uh (la-la la la la-la la lahhh)
It's the Cons fool, word (ohh ohh ohhhhh)
 
Oh no it can't be
G.O.O.D. music, my Grammy family
Used to bump the demo up outta the Camry
Now we hoppin out the limos or either the Lam-B
And after music meetings with Eva or Angie
They gon' probably add a joint that got John Legend and me
And we, be in Miami
So when they spot me and Bentley it's gon' be a stampede
Cause we be racin Bentleys no different than Grand Prix's
Fam please, don't make my man squeeze
Or we can take it to the clubs and I'll show you the hand speed
I started independent with owners from Landspeed
But now they recognize the way they did for Sam Sneed
And since I got my shot like I was callin man B
I hope they lose they spot and guarantee a Plan B
We'll be waitin in the telly like Jamie and Fancy
Probably paintin they nails in nothin but they panties
And we'll be Uptown like Jimmy and Cam B
Headed to the game to watch Kenyon and Camby
They can't breathe or hardly catch they next breath
And I know my nigga 'Ye told you we was the best dressed
I know I got a buzz so plan up the next step
So what y'all wanna do when it comes to that next check?
And bet 'Quence and Khaled know what the business is
So open up them envelopes, you know who the winners is
 
[John Legend] + (Kanye)
Ohh ohh ohhhhh (the Grammy family)
La-la la la la-lahhh, la-la la la la-lahhh
La-la la la la-lahhh, la-la la la la-la la lahhh
So on Grammy night
Call it G.O.O.D. family night
Celebrate tonight, ohh it's all right
It's all riiiiiight, yeah</pre>
