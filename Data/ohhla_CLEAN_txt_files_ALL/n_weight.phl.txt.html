[Hook]
Net weight gotta make papes
Multiple ways to get paid these days
Net weight various ways to make figures
And when it comes to money yo Grant's my nigga (x2)

[Verse 1]
A-yo take a moment and recognize I'm not average everyday
Act to display or disguise my enterprise in a wrong way
I got the rightaway, position myself for a brighter day
It's goin' okay
Like chron mixed with Alize on Friday a highday
I got two dice a Paradise (pair of dice) like Sade
Whenever I innovate precise words demonstrate
You're hooked like bait and bent all out of shape
To see me carry my net weight and gain adrenaline
I rock a rhyme like a timberland pole with soul
Emblem, Barber Shop is hemmin' 'em up
Subliminal stuff diamond in the rough
Mentally hand cuffed

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Net weight your midstate I anticipate this year alone
To microphones and money I'm prone it's on
To do what I gotta, rent a room at the Ramada
In any state I make the rhyme rate harder to deal with
Ill shit take a whole lot energy and Henessy your remedy
Remember me, on a long term ready to skip a quick fix
And guess who's in the mix on deck with the Knicks
Sickly I approach, genuine like leather bags from coats
To raps what I wrote sit back and take notes
Get up and perform I make the mic warm
A-yo this ain't the norm
MC with procedures at my leisure
Get the doe from the promo before he catches amnesia

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Net weight gotta make papes in an orderly fashion
Blastin' give me the loot I ain't askin' a damn thing
I be pullin' women like a hamstring
You be puttin' down payments on a romance ring
Fancy things while I stare with the glare that's rare
Beware this sonny don't share his goods he shares his bads
He shares his ? and height drags while he smoke his bags
Toes get tagged, travelin' on a straight line
People get they're ear to the grapevine
Twine twine and take mine
But they can't get near the brand new tear for this year
And grew the trick weed plus gear
I got the antidote for sounding dope
And I hope for nothing
Learn everything to earn net weight for something
