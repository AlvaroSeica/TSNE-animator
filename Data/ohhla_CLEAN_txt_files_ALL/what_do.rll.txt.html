Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
Some say I got my eyes, where my hands can't reach
It's 'cause I'm dreaming bigger, better!
But what do they know?
Got a million ways that I can eat
Because I do it, bigger, better!
So what do they know?

[Verse 1]
Some people think that I'm mad, and I might be
'Cause I think I can have what I want
But that ain't gonna stop me trying
'Cause I know why. I can go all the way to the top
Some say that I'm dumb, and think that I'm wrong
For thinking outside of the box
But there's so many things, that I can achieve
I won't let them put me off!
I can't hear the doubters, from where I am
I is but one inside I am
So let the haters, hate
Because that's okay, don't stop me right in my plans
I knew where I was gonna go before I got here
And they're just mad 'cause they're not here
So let they say, what they gonna keep saying
I don't give a shit, I don't careâ¦

[Chorus]
Some say I got my eyes, where my hands can't reach
It's 'cause I'm dreaming bigger, better!
But what do they know?
Got a million ways that I can eat
Because I do it, bigger, better!
So what do they know?

[Verse 2]
On another level, we aim higher
Everybody's fly, but my team's flyer
We set the pace, live it for the fans
Won't let anybody gain that bans
Live on the mic
Go a little harder, every time I touch Britain
That's another saga
And had two Number 1â²s this year, so far
So if I hit chicken boom, say you're farmer!

They same my eye weighs bigger than my belly
'Cause I, want the pig, but they offered me the pie
Pie, now we're sitting in the sky
Reach for the stars and I brought a little light
Down. Yes I came home with the prize
Didn't think much I just opened my eyes
(Why?) See it's just a sign at the time
Me, and it got to, and it got to my eyes

[Chorus]
Some say I got my eyes, where my hands can't reach
It's 'cause I'm dreaming bigger, better!
But what do they know?
Got a million ways that I can eat
Because I do it, bigger, better!
So what do they know?

[Bridge]
I don't really care what they got to say
I'll be doing the right thing by your way
Don't you wanna be on the way with me?
Well come play my way, my way, this bloke
I don't really care, really I don't mind
They stay, keeping up the more I shine
Wishing that they could do it
Like they see me do it!

[Chorus]
Some say I got my eyes, where my hands can't reach
It's 'cause I'm dreaming bigger, better!
But what do they know?
Got a million ways that I can eat
Because I do it, bigger, better!
So what do they know?
Some say I got my eyes, where my hands can't reach
It's 'cause I'm dreaming bigger, better!
But what do they know?
Got a million ways that I can eat
Because I do it, bigger, better!
So what do they know?</pre>
