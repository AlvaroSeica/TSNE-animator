[Intro: Xzibit]
Yeah...
X to the Z
Wiz Khalifa

[Xzibit]
Every day, lead to late nights
Bitches on my neck like a vampire appetite
Homie pass me a light, I got that master kush
Gave birth to you bastards, told yo' momma to push
Now here you are, I see you feelin strong
My prediction come here trippin you won't be livin long
Wait, I said that wrong, no let's negotiate
I'll wave my banner of peace, I hope you take the bait
Pussy nigga you fake, can't wait for the face-to-face
Hit you with the gauge, back in place, rip another page of the book of life
But for tonight we gon' celebrate, and smoke 'til we elevate
My motive for motivatin my niggaz, come on

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa] + (Xzibit)
Take a look in my eyes, and tell me what do you see?
(I'm gon' forever be me, therefore I'm forever a G)
All this liquor I drink, and then I smoke all this weed
(Smokin this weed, smokin this good, I got what you need)
A lot of niggaz would change if they could do what I be
(Now would you change or would you stay the same? Or so you think)
But I'll always be the same, I'm always gon' keep it G
(I'm gon' forever be me, therefore I'm forever a G)

[Xzibit]
It's gettin hard to survive, the streets'll eat you alive
Dumpin yo' body, yo' cadaver is covered with flies
Too much ratchets and trappin inside your rappin
Real niggaz actually laughin at your lights camera action
Do you, do you, do you, do you
(And whatever the fuck you think you gotta do)
Cause when I bring it through we hold court, puttin up playoff stats
While you hangin with the roaches and rats, we way above that
Now how you lovin that? Beat the breaks off the back of that bitch
You can't breathe, I'm diggin yo' ditch, can't believe I'm that deep in yo' shit
But for tonight we gon' celebrate, and smoke 'til we elevate
My motive for motivatin my niggaz, come on

[Chorus]

[Xzibit]
The greatest trick the devil ever put together
was that self-destruction is better than strivin for perfection
A seed of doubt can grow and quickly spread like an infection
Initiative to live, use your common sense as a weapon
If you (if you) only knew (only knew) half of this shit that I been through
Should've been a screenplay when I get through (when I get through)
Blow niggaz away, I.E.D., point blank range in the middle of the street
The fuck y'all niggaz gon' say to me? We don't play no games, just play for keeps and now
Back to the forefront, back to the backwoods, back on the tour bus
Get around the world for a few months, dump dead weight niggaz like a dump trunk
But for tonight we gon' celebrate, and smoke 'til we elevate
My motive for motivatin my niggaz, come on

[Chorus]
