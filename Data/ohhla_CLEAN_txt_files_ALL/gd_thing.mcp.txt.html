(Aw shucks... hey, let me tell you somethin)

Good thing
You had a good thing
But you blew it

A good thing
You had a good thing
But you blew it

(And for what?)

For some sweet talkin, sexy walkin young girl that's half your age
Never thought a man as fine as you would ever reach that stage
Of thinkin God put you on this Earth to please every girl in sight
Well, I don't think so, so see ya (Yeah, you think about that tonight!)

You had a good thing
A good thing
But you blew it

(For what?)

For some mini-skirt flirt, sellin dreams to hang around (Whaaat?)
You was lonely and needed companionship and that's exactly what you found (Mhmhmmm)
Just a one night stand, you understand as being just a fling
And now I'm gone (Read him!) Tell me, how does it feel to lose? (Sing!)

A good thing
You had a good thing
But you blew it

A good thing
You had a good thing
But you blew it

You know what?
I'm glad it's over
Maybe now I can keep some money in my pockets 
instead of bein Peaches First National, know what I'm sayin?
Now what you can do with yourself
Sit around the house and roll pennnies?
Come to think about it, I have to give you the pennies and roll
You had a good thing

(Aw shucks... hey, let me tell you somethin)

Now fool me once, that's shame on you and twice it's shame on me
Well, once was enough, sweetheart, and twice I just can't see
That was the final straw, it's over and I'm givin back your ring
(No Peaches, keep the ring) You really think I should? (Of course) Okay (Sing!)

Good thing
You had a good thing
But you blew it

Good thing
You had a good thing
But you blew it</pre>
