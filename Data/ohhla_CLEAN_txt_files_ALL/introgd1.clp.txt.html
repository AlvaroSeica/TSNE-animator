[Intro: excerpt from "Scarface"]
Don't fucking go crazy on me, okay?
Just remember last year at this time
we were in a fucking cage, okay?
(You remember
 I'd like to forget that)
I say be happy with what you've got
(You be happy
 Me, I want what's coming to me)
Oh, well what's coming to you?
(The world chico
 and everything in it)</pre>
