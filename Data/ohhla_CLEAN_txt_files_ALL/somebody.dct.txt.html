Suggestions, questions, People want to know
Is there life after talk, Cause there's talk on the road
Twistin' words that I've never even said
To the ones that I trust on my ??? Or my "Boo" in our bed
Will he make it, man I bet he won't As they're runnin' through the minutes
On their cell phones So the pictures painted
You got the point
And that junk's creepin' into my solo joint

Sometimes I feel God in the middle of the night
In the cool of the shade in the bright sunlight

I always feel like somebody's watching me
Watch baby, watch baby, He got my back
See I'm down with the King
So I got it like that

It's no joke, I've been roped in, Chokin' on a bone
From a fish in the school of your twilight zone
You shook me, took me to me to another place
Where the air I'm breathin's like mace in my face
If this controversy is your way
You need to know I'll never doubt my destiny
'Cause I'm stickin' to my guns like a Son of the Light
Feelin' Dad, I'm feelin' Daddy in the air tonight

Sometimes I feel Grace in the middle of the night
In the cool of the shade in the bright sunlight
Sometimes I feel God in the midst of a show
As the palm trees sway in an afterglow

I always feel like somebody's watching me
Watch baby, watch baby He got my back
See I'm down with the king so I got it like that
I always feel like somebody's watching me
Watch baby, watch baby He got my back
See I'm down with the king so I got it like that</pre>
