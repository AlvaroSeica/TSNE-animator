[Mr. Walt]
Yo, everybody lookin at me like I'm 'bout to drop
some real fucked up, dissin black people shit
Just gone give it here, check it out

[Man]
Man, it's some cooold-hearted shit you doin dawg
I geuss tha-that's the way it is
Yea, folks don't write about this shit
Why you got to focus on negativity?!
You forgot that didn't cha
Yea but I see it gooood now

[Last Emperor]
Yo I remember when the summer was hot, I'm huggin my block
The soldier, tryin to get over with this hustle I got
Lookin out for the cops, on my way to the top
Ain't no reason to even question if I'm rugged or not
I saw the neighborhood stars drivin our favorite cars
See they out gettin theirs, so now we tryin to get ours
Through a neighborhood tours, goin through neighborhood wars
Gettin bigger doors, mixin this neighborhood sport
We had a powerful team, doin powerful things
The A-merican dream, I'm about gettin cream
It ain't just for me, it's for my whole family
This is for all of y'all, I call it the Hustler's Theme, knah'mean?

[Chorus]
Someone, somewhere
Someway, somehow
Get mines, get yours
Get up, get down
Sometime, someday
Someplace, sometown
It's starts, with us
Right here, right now

[Last Emperor]
Amidst the dangerous days, and the dangerous nights
The lost wages and the salary heights
I stayed out of harms way, helped my family to fight
When I slipped into darkness, they brought me back to the light
Pray to the Lord above for added insight
A man confronted with THESE challenges in his life
To the ladies I might, be the compassionate type
Come see if it's real and feel what my action is like
Right, the man of your dreams, I'm handlin fiends
Fabolous things, more than mansions and rings
A palace built for a king, is how rich'll be
You tryin to win, get a peice of this victory
And don't ask about my past, that's history
Don't be afraid of the hustle girl, just get with me
You gotta love supreme, but as good as it seems
I'm in love with the cream, this is the Hustler's Theme, knah'mean?

[Chorus]

[Last Emperor]
Can you stay alive in this strugglin thing?
Stay alive in this hustlin thing?
The hustle's only as good, as what the customers bring
Some are no longer with us, others locked up in the bing
See I found a knew trade that I hustle with
It's called hip-hop and I got a love for it
Far from easy believe me y'all, I must admit
Cuz y'all customers'll never get enough of this
And now you can depend on your local suppliers
The Last Emp again, down with Da Beatminerz
Rockin wit'chu, we ain't forget 'chu, as we continue
Catch us at the venue, the Hustler's Theme

[Chorus]
