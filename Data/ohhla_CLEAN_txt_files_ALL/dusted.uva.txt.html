(Intro: Roots Manuva)
How many y'all guys say want freestyle?
There will be no blows not freestyle
This style is not free, the style is expensive alright!!
Hold tight youth

(Roots Manuva)
Love it's self I possess who lied to death
Yigga y'all, listen it's the up front fresh
My level is seldom seen, if you invite
between them fools they couldn't announce my king
Lean to the mean for a Brad-picky-head
Slapped in the face, trapped down I guess 
Sunset to sunset, but don't sweat yet
Cool with down Fred by the doves that hold me
I'm picky with position, I've made my decision now
Death itself can't hold us down
Cause the seeds are progressed and done get sow
My tough back, broke the cane in four
face flat to the floor but I found the strength
to commence with a brand new sense of self
Hero's zoo-loo, comin' true
Tokyo train style, hip it to the crew

(Chorus: Leftfield &amp; Roots Manuva)
(Down like crumb and we dusted), good job
(Down like crumb and we dusted), good job

(Roots Manuva)
???Lovin' my clicks, yeah my baby like Flex???
But I won't waste my breath, I'll let actions speak
Though the speak stand taller than the peak of Ever Best
I visualize, embrace the progress 
Chin-high, puff, just step right to it
The choice is, there is no choice but to pursue it
Soul on the mind, mind on the soul
My struggle remains, but my inside grows

(Chorus: Leftfield &amp; Roots Manuva)
(Down like crumb and we dusted), good job
(Down like crumb and we dusted), good job
(Down like crumb and we dusted), good job
(Down like crumb and we dusted)

(Roots Manuva)
Against the grain we shall remain, huh
Yeah, steamin' on
Gain enough earth gain enough ground
Movement tight, bet it white flight
In the sight set to step to the hype
Left-to-the-field now, lookin' good
Wait till this way would bounce
Proud to announce I'm still filed Â– stuck in my way
I heed not no he'll say: I put my trust in my own perceptions 
I knowledge a-self

(Chorus: Leftfield &amp; Roots Manuva)
(Down like crumb and we dusted), good job
(Down like crumb and we dusted), good job
(Down like crumb and we dusted), good job
(Down like crumb and we dusted), get yourself into hard life - good job

(Outro: Roots Manuva)
The power of the inner eye huh
mets the strength of weed
Groove, world, birth to the next realm
Motions splendid, it bring quality
Now my force side see with nuff clarity 
Motions splendid, it bring quality
Now my force side see with nuff clarity</pre>
