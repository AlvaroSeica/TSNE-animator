Dilla...Slum Villa...
Focus... boy Nitty..
It's real special right now...
Feel good, don't it?
Feel like I just wanna...
Talk to my homeboy...
He ain't here right now, but he here right now (...feel me?)

Aiyyo waddup, my nigga? It's ya boy Furda
I'm workin hard, I'm givin 'em bloody murda
Keepin the dream alive, y'know just how we talked about it
We smoke hella blunts, know the vision never clouded
Seems like I'm out with Illa every other week
Swear to God, you'd be there when he rappin over beats
Niggas, we tryna get it, the legacy won't fall
That's why I started up the label and put out The Concert Hall
Done by me and RJ, Uncle Craig is nasty
on the keys and I got the B'z in ashtray
And y'know we still smoke that la to the lah
And I still know you watchin, so a nigga blowin high
And me and Dank fly, away and we play the..
songs that we made up, you keep ya niggas paid up
It's Scrap's phone ringin, I heard they lookin for me
'Cause I continue to give the people what Dilla taught me
And that's real spit, and I'ma end it there (yeah, yeah...)
Frank Nitt, signin off and I'm outta here 
Outta here

[Illa J]
Look James, you already know
We is incredible, got that {?} blown
You know we be butta, 'cause we on the roll
And I'm protectin the alien code don't nobody know
But did you know, your boy Com datin Serena
In movies with Angelina; Beyonce basically is the new Tina
O-O-OBAMA - in the Black House
Slammin on people like the rookie Jerry Stackhouse
While Kanye playin with 808s', I'm just keepin you updated
Jus playin James! Y'know we miles ahead
I be tellin these amateurs to put they styles to bed
So go to sleep, ocean deep
Get killed by a Focus... beat
'til they can't walk like they got frozen feet
And you know alot of our shit leak
But it's cool, we got TONS of heat
Uh

[Baatin] (T3)
When you make a track touch the soul, you givin it
Immaculate to the Concept, you live in it
Turn it up top notch, get the feelin
You about to set it off while your head nod
Now you feelin it, now witness the whole scene
We keep it live, turn it up, that's perfection
In the dream and keep it super hot
Bear witness to gift the unwrap and if it don't stop
'til the break of day, we keep it on
Turn it up to the top notch for Dilla to the break of dawn
Keep it LIIIIIIIVE~! {*echoes*}
(Keep-keep-keep it live, keep-keep-keep it live)
Keep-keep-keep it live
Keep it LIIIIIIIIVE~!  {*echoes*}

[T3]
LIVE - Dilla Dawg man I miss you 
and I can't express the feelings
Comes to a crack on your track, you know we killed it
Everytime we do a show, you'll always be remembered
When the pen hits the pad, you always in my lyrics
And our friendship is a givena nd your legacy is living
In your path, that you laid, I hope it trickles to your children
This is somethin, gotta mention hope your parents get the right attention
So when the money comes, they the only ones that's benefitin
Yeah, you started this SV shit, so when we spilt
Still wit us, he breed this, Detroit players
Yea, dog, that's that myth, some, tried
But naw dag, it ain't like these, negro please
This is Dillanation, straight 313 with the cups celebratin</pre>
