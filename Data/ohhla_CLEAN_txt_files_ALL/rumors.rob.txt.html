Hi this is Steve Austin reporting live from San Diego, California
I'm here with two controversial rappers from the city
Lil' Rob and Mr. Shadow aka the Mayhem Click
And we're talking about rumors
Now Lil' Rob we understand you have an album out called The Crazy Life
Can you tell us some of the rumors that have emerged since the release
Of that album, and some of the things you've been through

[Lil' Rob]
Well let me put it like this all these fools talking shit all the time
I was 16 with the bullet, representing the 619
But these fools couldn't take it, they didn't want me to make it
And so they'd rather hate it because they just can't fade it
Gang related, situated, now I'm back
These putos talking smack, but I kind of like that in a way
And one day I might say they're the ones who helped me do this
Had it in me all the time and I knew this, I'm still foolish
Fools are clueless to what I can do with my ability
Thought of myself as a cholo not a real MC
So I did what I did and I'm so glad that I did it
Because it put some chips in my pocket when I'm finished
Using words like simon and leva
People try to put me down but end up floating down the river
See I told you twice before, but I'll say it one more time
You do your thing holmes, but I'ma do mine

[Lil' Rob]
And basically that's what I think
All these fucking fools can talk all the fucking shit about me
Cuz I could give a fuck, you know what I mean
This proves I'm above their level, you know

Look at all these rumors, started by jealous people
Look at all these rumors, started by jealous people

[Steve Austin]
So Shadow, I understand you're having similar problems to those of Lil' Rob
Is there anything you'd like to say to them player-haters?
And if so, what would it be?

[Mr. Shadow]
Man I gotta give it up to those punk who try and diss me
Talking mad shit, but they miss me, remenice me
Because they used to talk head about my rhymes
And when they heard me on the radio they request it till I die
And I bust at it and I love you yapping lips
Cuz it makes me rap my rolas and my music, stack my chips
This is Shadow the crazy vato them fools want to battle
Then they end up on the gravel when they act like hoes and tattle
Now why would you want part of this truthfulness
Don't get caught up in the mix
Cuz I hate them phony putos dippin all up in my business
Ese gotta hit the street for all them fools that player-hate
Cuz ain't no bunch of chavalas stopping me from making bank
I need to take it to make it, like laws I break it unfaded
I'll be remaining like Satan, I'm serving hate to those who perpertrating

[Mr. Shadow]
That's pretty much how I feel
So I tell them haters you can only witness what you see
Not the things you hear
Remember that

Look at all these rumors, started by jealous people
Look at all these rumors, started by jealous people

[Steve Austin]
Since we're talking about rumors
I heard Lil' Rob and Shadow weren't always the best of friends
So Shadow can you clear that up for us and tell us what's really going on?

[Mr. Shadow]
Simon we had some problems but like adults we had to squash it
We formed the Mayhem Click (Why?) cuz everybody wants it
The badest motherfuckers together no one's ever gonna intimidate us
Just imitate us, player-hate us
Don't bother anylising anything we do
Cuz the shit we kick is tight and you know that this is true
Mr. Shadow and Lil' Rob making heads bob and it don't stop
Cuz we're bound to keep on flowing till you see our caskets drop

[Lil' Rob]
It's that one little cholo back before I go
Just thought I'd let you know that you can never stop my flow
So I suggest you put that shit to rest, quit talking all that mess
You're just talking about the best and you're just wasting your breath
As I sit here, thinking never thought it would be you
The city that I represent talking all that shit
See cuz all we do is kick it and mind my our business
Lil' Rob and Mr. Shadow (scratching fools off the bitch list)

[Mr. Shadow]
So now you know where we're coming from
And with that, it concludes our story for today
I hope you motherfuckers learned your leason
And learned how to keep your fucking trap shut
And quit spreading rumors that aren't true
Cuz that shit be getting motherfuckers in trouble
And believe me you don't want part of that
You don't want none of this Mayhem Click
And we're out
