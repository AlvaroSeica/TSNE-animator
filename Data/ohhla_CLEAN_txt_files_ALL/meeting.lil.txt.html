Awe shit this dream is crazy

How many suckas dying tonight before we say its not right
How many suckas dying tonight before we say its not right
How many people dying tonight before we say its not right
How many people dying tonight before we say its not right

I need a pastor, I need a deacon
...I think I found Jesus
My mind's on the thesis
I'm staying based I need it
But these niggas out-ree-gis
I was playing on defense
Switch courts, I switched sides
Nah, we not even
I said we not even
I said we not even
I think I need the deacon
I think I need the deacon
I'm dreaded like a rasta
I need the sh- like the opera
I hit you bitches with the choppa
Then ride up on you with my rastas

Fuck with me man, the townspeople we rocking to this gutta shit live

How many suckas dying tonight before we say its not right
How many suckas dying tonight before we say its not right
How many these bitches dying tonight before we say its not right
How many these bitches dying tonight before we say its not right</pre>
