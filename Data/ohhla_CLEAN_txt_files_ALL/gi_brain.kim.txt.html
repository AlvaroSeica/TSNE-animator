[Intro]
Yeah (touchin all five boroughs with this shit)
Step into my rainforest
(Shout to Amadou out there) Step into my rainforest
Yeah only for the sexy people
(It wouldn't be right if I didn't touch it)
Step into my rainforest
Yeah, yeah
Step into my rainforest, uh-huh
You see, I'm wet

[Lil' Kim]
Step into my rainforest
I'm tryin to see who gon'
make it make it rain on this, tornado pussy
Can you make it monsoon, honeymoon
Now we fuckin like a bride and groom
You want a taste of honey? I need to see the money
You wanna see the spread? You gotta spend some bread
Them racks in your pants, that'll make me dance
Now fill the bag with cash, come on hop up on this ass

[Chorus]
Make it rain trick
Make it, make it rain trick
Make it rain trick
Make it, make it rain trick
Gimme brain trick
Gimme, gimme brain trick
Gimme brain, make it rain
Gimme brain trick
(I'ma need some brains bitch) {*2X*}
(Need some brains bitch)
(I'ma need some brains bitch)
(I'ma make it rain bitch) {*2X*}
(Make it rain bitch)
(I'ma make it rain bitch)

[Lil' Kim]
This kitty ain't for rowboats, even Titanics get washed away
He put his head between my legs and he washed his face
Come and scuba dive, inside my deep blue sea
Wanna ride this tidal wave? You gotta pay a fee
Lick on the clit, I'll lick on the dick
Ride or die bitch, I sit on the shit
Can't get it wet, I spit on shit
Spit on spit on spit on the shit
Suck it up sit back on the dick
Doggystyle back it up on the dick
Get a grip on them hips, bite on my lips
Take it out, cum right on my tits
You want a taste of honey? I need to see the money
You wanna see the spread? You gotta spend some bread
Them racks in your pants, that'll make me dance
Now fill the bag with cash, come on hop up on this ass

[Chorus]</pre>
