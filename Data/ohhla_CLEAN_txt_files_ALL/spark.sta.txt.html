[Intro: Action Bronson] (Statik Selektah Sample)
Bam Bam! (Statik Selektah!) Back again it's me!
Ah it's me!

[Verse One: Action Bronson]
You ain't seen me for a minute but i've been here
Money gettin longer like my chin hairy, I sport the latest style the swimwear
I wish I would've known the night would be this way (Why?!)
Then again if I knew would I do it the same?
Beamer olive but it's blue in the rain
Copped my man a matchin six and now we two of the same
It's only right right?! right! everybody eatin man
But me first I'm a hunter and I'm selfish (Uh!)
Dunk on Tim Duncan, 360 on your bitches face
Jump in the rental with the Maryland tags
Don't make me go inside the travelin bag
Then put my spoon inside then put it in the ram again
Leave you in past tense, all my bitches got accents
Some big fat asses and a black benz
Don't even call'cause I'm in Rome (Nope!)
Peace to all my fuckin people locked up that should've been home

[Chorus: Mike Posner] (Joey Bada$$)
My whole life was runnin away, and now I run with the wind
Dont know what else they gonna say, look he done it again
Glory, glory all I want, now I'm out of the dark
(Yo word is fuckin bond!) Oooh Oooh! It all started with a little spark

[Verse Two: Joey Bada$$]
As I open up my mind and I open up my choppers
Perceivin in the light, as I focus through my optics
Third eye watchin stay open when I'm sleepin 
Less sleep more work but I always stay dreamin
Life stay seemin like I'm driftin
Stay schemin niggas wanna slaughter my existence
But I stay shiftin and if in reality 
Then ask the higher God change your channel imbalance of me
Like let me know let me know let me know what it is
Let me tell 'em let me tell 'em what's, wrong with the kids
Like the Pro Era crew way, Joey Bad who?!
Oh the Joey that blew like Indigo Hugh
He's an indigo too, sent to lead the generation
Consciousness, awareness and world domination
Face it the government been out to replace 'em
For every route, business taken

[Chorus: Mike Posner] 
My whole life was runnin away, and now I run with the wind
Dont know what else they gonna say, look he done it again
Glory, glory all I want, now I'm out of the dark
Oooh Oooh! It all started with a little spark


[Outro: Statik Selektah Scratchin] (Mike Posner)
I-I-I-I-I-I put it down!-"Lil' Fame" (It all started with a little spark)
I-I-I-I-I put it down!-"Lil' Fame" (It all started with a little spark)
I-I-I-I put it d-d-dow-d-d-d-d-dow-d-d-d-do-down!-"Lil' Fame"
I-I-I-I put it down!-"Lil' Fame"
(No autotune or mental doubt was used in the making of this recording thank you for listening)</pre>
