[Verse 1- Nicki Minaj]
Maybe you tired 'cause everybody askin where you at
I tried to channel you in hopes that I could steer you back
But this like every intersection we just missed each other
You got your fans waitin, tell me you ain't six feet under
And tell me that you comin back and you just took a break
Maybe I blamed you for everythin that was my mistake
In hindsight, I loved your hornets and I loved your edge
'Cause it was you who talked me down from jumpin off the ledge
Your earrings bamboo, your long nails too
Your BMW everytime you came through
You was the Braveheart, you stole Wayne heart
You never switched it up, you played the same part
But I need to grow and I needed to know
Were there some things inside of me that I needed to show
So I just deaded you, left you in all black
But dear Old Nicki (please call back)

[Chorus- Nicki Minaj]
You told me, you'd come when I needed you
And you said it so sweetly, I believed you
But I'm standin here callin, I can't see you
But I'm holdin you, holdin you, holdin you to that

[Verse 2]
Did I chase the gleams and glimmer, money, fame and power
'Cause if so that will forever go down my lamest hour
I shoulda kept you with me, gettin at them nameless cowards
They was no match for you, couldn't defeat your powers
I had to make them changes, I hope you understood
You see for every bad I did a ton of good
But you was underground and I was main stream
I live the life now that we would day-dream
My only wish is you come enjoy it with me
Get on them conference calls go meet the lawyers with me
The money came yeah, I tripled it, quadrupled it
But I still miss us when we was just on some stupid shit
And its still fuck the media
They ridiculed you, never believed in ya
They just deaded you, left you in all black 
But dear Old Nicki (please call back)

[Chorus]

[Bridge: Nicki Minaj]
Yes I'm holdin you, holdin you, holdin you 
And yes I'm holdin you, holdin you, holdin you 
And yes I'm holdin you, holdin you, holdin you to that
And yes I'm holdin you, holdin you, holdin you 
And yes I'm holdin you, holdin you, holdin you 
And yes I'm holdin you, holdin you, holdin you to that</pre>
