this isn't real, traveling while sitting still
I sit and ponder like monks, running water and smoke
open space, so quiet it hurts to listen
time folds, eyes close, I'm free in prison
c'mon, silent, silent
c'mon, silent c'mon, silent

no way I'm safe, now I'm being followed by rain clouds
I gotta change routes with the utensils to break out
I gotta get a grip of what it is that got a hold of me
its over me, too hard for me to reach and its controlling me
a crazy puppet master pulling strings behind controls
down below,getting jerked around, putting on a show
its like circus clowns, freaks, each with odd jobs
products of their environment, driven by cattle prods
I move about my course of life just like a bitch up on a chess board
carried by the wind, deteriorating to vanishing point
I could get token out but cant imagine it happening
I'm managing to keep good looking out when challenges, challenging
everything is everything, my motto is what ever happens, happens
that way of thinking justifies my actions
psychosis, any antonym is bogus, prognosis
your perception is out of focus, diagnosed with the hopless
check the symptoms, c'mon silent

its me against the world, I'm out here on my own
and with all these chasing waterfalls
I'm far away from home,
its me against the world
I'm up against the ropes and if I could beat the odds
its got me going through the most (x2)

I use to know the answers until I changed the questions
I useto have a clue or two until I changed directions
corrected, I contemplated purpose of existence
its senseless to subsist, sheltered and shit
I live my life rillin' dice, keep demeaner tight
holding the mic, I rap to fight wrong with the right
you know, I wouldn't release it if the song wasn't tight
I be in deep thought with pen and pad, no one in sight
your damn right I live my life for the moment
rollin the dice
your damn right I live my life for the moment
rollin the dice
what was crashed under the overpass with cans and graffiti
__ with stems and beadies, drags __
by the lamppost , blue skies darker then deep grey,
mad hoes, ___ for the brain
follow the streets face, train tracks, freeways, pass the bus, bridge gaps
time moves fast, travelin'
transits, transfers, sunsets from a rooftop building downtown
the club scenes electric
saturday night night
