[Project Pat]
I been slangin on this green praying that I don't get cut
by these police making raids, jumping out and checking nuts
Cuttin balls down to none, babbage weed is in my lungs
Niggas stiff me for a bag, I'ma shoot em in his ass
I'ma show 'em who the boss, when you niggaz gonna learn
When you cross in this game then yo ass will get burned
When my turn? or my time? rock a what, for a dime
Takin' fair chance after chance, but I got to dance
Take the rules of this shit, that's why I keep a revolver
How the hell you mobbers gonna rob the robber
Boy I'm gonna scar ya, with pistol slap cross mouth
Reachin in yo pockets, and take yo money out
When you know what's goin', you got cheese, I got dope
For da 900th stone, I got peas, I got coke
ain't no credit give mang you could get from round here
Niggas robbing, niggas banging niggas slangin' down here

[chorus]

I got cheeeese, hoez, and a bunch of fucking dope
I got peeeeeas, coke, and some killaz at da doo'
Hyyydro weed smokin a quarter ounce of blow
What yoooouuuu need brah, is to fuck wit yo boy


[Project Pat]
Quarter bird what's the word?  For you dawg it's the low
Selling me babbage weed but you want the purest snow
I'ma go, I'ma pull me a rabbit out a hat
Ounce of cane mixed with sugar, and some killaz strapped with gats
Always trying to be slick, you done stepped in some shit
You done broke ghetto laws, you done tore yo fuckin drawers
Nigga boy, he ain't know, cus da street never lies
Walk right up on yo ass, shoot you, right between the eyes, 
you be stinkin' wit the flies
Walking around on chrome, wit yo bitch, smokin' dro
Fucking all in yo home, while ya kissing on her lips
She be sucking on ma dick, grip the glock - sixteen booms as I dip
Through the streets of da hood, north memphis hollywood
Represent it to the max, I'm just out here statin' facts
Trying to stack me some pape's, got my foot on you snakes
I'ma squeeze off some lead for you niggas that are fake

[chorus 2x]

[Project Pat]
You could duck from the tech out the Escalade
Once I get my cheese, or my flow, then I must be paid
If you want to come against me dawg, bring your whole brigade
But you shall get sliced like a throat with a swisher blade
Sippin' on some pauly vision, like some sweet kool-aid
Strapped with me, an automatic gun, don't you violate
Niggaz sent a snitch on me dawg, I didn't hesitate
Caught him, at the projects one day, sent him, to his grave
Playaz wanna come through the hood, but they got the fear
Knowing it ain't all to the good, you could get it here
Wrong place, at the wrong time, calling "sip" let's go
Dope fiends keep me up with them, and my pockets swoll
Eyes red as hell cuz I ain't had a lick of sleep
Snorted a quarter ball, so that I can stay on my feet
Treat any bitch just the same as a nigga too
If you trusting hoes in this game, you'se a dammn fool..
