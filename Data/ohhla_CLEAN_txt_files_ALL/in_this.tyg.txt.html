Typed by: AZ Lyrics

T-Many
Drive young bitches crazy
You know the motto
Fuck you, boy pay me
Ball Mainin
Belt cost 1280
Kick a bitch'
Out if she acting full dazy
Had a bitch, went to polly
Call her my beach baby
I fuck her every night
She be, she be calling it dating
You kiss her face you basic
She always faking
I give her real orgasms
Ovulations

Uhh
This the type of shit
They calling amazing
Baseline, drop, guncock back Troy Aikman
Ay, nigga don't be stealing my swag
It's to late ain't it
I'm a dog, shhh
Lady &amp; the tramp baby
All Gucci though
Knock em down like a domino
Bringin it to your front door
Domeshot, PorchFloor
Too many bitches

Bitch I'm In This
Thang [4X]
But bitch I'm in This
Thang [4X]
I'm in this thang, but bitches going down, down [2X]

Fingers in the air
Niggaz gonna start banging
Throwing money to the birds
Put em in their cages
Niggaz wild
Can't tame me with a gas chamber
Deep dish rims
Lips like Tapanga
On my two busy for you shit call me later
If I was a bum I'd give you nun
Like the church ladies
It's aggravating
Niggaz, fucking up my aviaton
Flyer than most
Trying not to boast
But niggaz debating
Uh, and the broads gonna follow
My nigga Wale told me pop my collar
Chain so gotti
They though we was gotti brothers
Two twin bitches
My nigga fucked the other

Shh, Chillin Tropic
