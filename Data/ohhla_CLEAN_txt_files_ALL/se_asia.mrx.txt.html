Verse 1:

I'm higher in degree, and speak accordingly
To the society I see, left in fire and debris
Variety is key, need knowledge to be free
Like the priory of scion, supply it with a fee
They inspire me to be, wise as a chief
Undermining the plea and fill their lines with deceit
Attire of the street, wear wires underneath
Most of the records you buying they lying through their teeth
Denying the grief
Where they from and become empty
Unfriendly, some weak some deadly
Increase salary, become wealthy
But its hard to achieve when your mentality is unhealthy
The slum felt me,purists know marx will rock
Every recording dropped from your squadron flopped
Talk about them in the parking lot
To the barbershop regardless if they frauds or not
Access denied perils had the border locked
Cook it up serve it straight from a scorching pot
They say marxman you ought to stop
Your styles too underground kid unorthodox
Stalk the blocks like we warring with the armored cops
Who had the corners blocked, with their revolvers cocked
Forces plot to let your carcass rot
Beneath foreign crops
So I'm sending out warning shots

Verse 2:

I came to build a nation with the skill of a mason
Executing an industry infiltration
Face humiliation,with a losing strategy
Some claim affiliation, but I only move with family
Dudes produce trash to me
Kept their eyes on loot, lust and fantasy
Step inside the booth and I'm just glad to be
Write the truth annually
What you would do for salary
This music is therapeutic to june and his agony
And it soothes my insanity
I use it to diffuse anything that saddens me
And apparently, they got hidden motives
Venom spittin cobras, in the scripts I focus
Give eviction notice, to traitors and thats that
Labeled backpack if your language abstract
I aim past rap, notice if the bars simple
still a jewel just decode it like the lost symbol

Hook:

It's like I speak another language
And they cease to understand it
I speak what they seek in the tablet
And they cease to understand it
It's like a whole nother dialect
I embrace the truth while their hiding it
My environment, read it like data
They will come and go like seasons in nature
Born on the equator, southeast asia
Some praise his efforts,some doubt hes greater
Calling him a savior, label him an anti christ
Maybe hes the product of some alcohol and bad advice
Still his craft is nice, willing to sacrifice
Blast and slice for a small glimpse of paradise
I wrote body of god to walk the path of christ
And still go to war with any of your acolytes
