Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro]
Testify on my nigga, I'm a blow up your house
For the last few years, I had control of the south
When you head up north, either one with the coke
French Montana, straight off the boat

[Chorus]
(I get it) straight off the boat
(I need it) straight off the boat
(I get it) straight off the boat
(I need it) straight off the boat
(I get it) straight off the boat
(I need it) straight off the boat
(I get it) straight off the boat
(I need it) straight off the boat

(I get it!) 8 grand a piece
(I get it!) 8 grand a piece
(I need it!) 5 grand a piece
(I need it!) 5 grand for me
(We got it) New York niggaz
(We got it) down south niggaz
(Don't doubt it) all real niggaz
(Don't doubt it) all real niggaz
We 'bout it

[Verse 1: French Montana]
This that heroin flow, just signed to Atlantic
I get it fresh off the boat, I get it 'cross the Atlantic
I just fired my banker, now I just rubberband it
Should I cop me some acres?, should I cop me some candy?
I hear voices all in my head, bricks all in my spirit
Fuck you do with that bread, bitches all in my ear
I done counted a dollar, then I counted a million
Then I looked up to God like what the fuck is this feeling
I got a rush for that life, I had a bitch out the projects
She used to package the white and bring me back my deposit
I'm talking 8 grand a piece, I'm on the floor with the Lakers
I'm talking 8 grand a seat, Louie sneaks with no laces

[Chorus]
(I get it) straight off the boat
(I need it) straight off the boat
(I get it) straight off the boat
(I need it) straight off the boat
(I get it) straight off the boat
(I need it) straight off the boat
(I get it) straight off the boat
(I need it) straight off the boat

(I get it!) 8 grand a piece
(I get it!) 8 grand a piece
(I need it!) 5 grand a piece
(I need it!) 5 grand for me
(We got it) New York niggaz
(We got it) down south niggaz
(Don't doubt it) all real niggaz
(Don't doubt it) all real niggaz
We 'bout it

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Maybach on Monday, Testarossa on Tuesday
My wide body on Wednesday but my boat is my beauty
All my Friday's Ferrari, like to pull out my jewelry
If you work with the judge, better pray to the jury
I got put in a rental, and I'm strapped like I'm Boobie
Had more guns in the car than the whole state of Missouri
Get it straight off the boat, yea my life is a movie
Got a 3 story mansion, big saltwater jacuzzi
Get it straight off the boat, she get it straight off the plate
Appetite disapperead, but it ate off her face
Now they tapping my phones, wanna give me the Rico
Speaking Spanish to Papi, tryna get them for cinco

[Chorus]
(I get it) straight off the boat
(I need it) straight off the boat
(I get it) straight off the boat
(I need it) straight off the boat
(I get it) straight off the boat
(I need it) straight off the boat
(I get it) straight off the boat
(I need it) straight off the boat

(I get it!) 8 grand a piece
(I get it!) 8 grand a piece
(I need it!) 5 grand a piece
(I need it!) 5 grand for me
(We got it) New York niggaz
(We got it) down south niggaz
(Don't doubt it) all real niggaz
(Don't doubt it) all real niggaz
We 'bout it</pre>
