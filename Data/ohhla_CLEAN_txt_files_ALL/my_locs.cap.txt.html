[Mr. Capone-E *slowed down*]
It's Mr. Capone-E

Chorus: Mr. Capone-E
I got my locs on high
And they pointed to the sky
I bring 'em down to my eyes
Cause I-I-I stay fly
I got my locs on high
And they pointed to the sky
I bring 'em down to my eyes
Cause I-I-I stay fly

[Verse 1: Mr. Capone-E {Mr. Capone-E *slowed down*}]
Get your locs on, get your pose on
It don't really matter cause I'm badder than bad, mon
It's the fresh song, it's the new song
Move to the beat, then jam to it, mon
Okay (Okay)
Now here's the dance
It don't really matter if you got tight pants
Black, white, brown, or tan
You could be old, fat, skinny or bad
Grab your loc, bro, bounce like six-four
Chill with kinfolks, like the hundred spokes
Moves are simple, instrumental
{Mental, mental, mental}

Repeat Chorus

Hook: Tiffany Z (Mr. Capone-E)
I like it with your locs on (Okay)
I like it with your locs on (Yay, yay)
I like it with your locs on (Okay)
I like it with your locs on (Yay, yay)
I like it with your locs on (Okay)
I like it with your locs on (Yay, yay)
I like it with your locs on (Okay)
I like it with your locs on (Yay, yay)

[Tiffany Z]
Uno, dos, tres
Otra vez, otra vez
Holla

[Verse 2: Mr. Capone-E {Mr. Capone-E *slowed down*}]
Keep bouncin' with them locs on
Beats got you groovin', cruisin', movin' to the song
Okay (Okay)
Now you back, feeling good
(???) that we were posing, it's all hood
T.Z. keeps spinnin', we with it, oh yeah
Everybody's partyin'
Hell yeah
Locs on, it don't mean nada
Just havin' fun, no more valas
All my ladies, that shake them nalgas
{Nalgas, nalgas}

Repeat Chorus

Repeat Hook

Break: Mr. Capone-E
If you ain't got your locs
Take your broke ass home
If you ain't got your locs
Take your broke ass home
And if you got a pair
Go ahead and throw 'em on
And if you got a pair
Go ahead and throw 'em on

[Mr. Capone-E {Mr. Capone-E *slowed down*}]
Night and day, in the shade
Move to it, it's okay
Night and day, in the shade
Move to it, it's okay
Night and day, in the shade
Move to it, it's okay
Night and day, in the shade
Move to it {It's okay}

Repeat Chorus
