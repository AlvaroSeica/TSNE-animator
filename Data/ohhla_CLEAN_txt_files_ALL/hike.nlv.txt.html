All the gangsters out that third stop
That mutherfuckin' bullshit don't you
Know you dissin' a U. N. L. V.  theme bitch
Cash Money productions comin' at you
Comin' later on the Eddie Bow part 2
First I got two bags of weed it's not
That easy to lie again here I go again
With another dance I call the Hike
Pucker up with your thumbs
In with your back 
Turn your rzights to left 
If you get dizzy don't look back

Chorus:

Well one of my fuckin' boys
Packed and scope a nigga named Mike
I'm a long way from home and don't see nothin' in sight
I got to hike(hzike) hike(hzike) hike(hzike) hike(hzike)
Hike(hzike) hike(hzike) hike(hzike)
(2x)

First Verse
{Yella Boy)

Yes I still got my fuckin' bike and I'm on a hot ten
I lost my fuckin' self because I was drinkin' that juice and gin
I got my bike build back up I'm doin' a Billie five 
If it wasn't for my helmet yeah I wouldn't be alive
I had a powder hot girlie the bitches kicked in
I lost control of my fuckin' bike then I thought this was the end
I flipped over the front on the ground I'm on my soccer bike
I have to control myself I thank the Lord I'm still alive
Well

Chorus:

Well one of my fuckin' boys
Packed and scope a nigga named Mike
I'm a long way from home and don't see nothin' in sight
I got to hike(hzike) hike(hzike) hike(hzike) hike(hzike)
Hike(hzike) hike(hzike) hike(hzike)
(2x)

Second Verse:
{Yella Boy}

Just proven a point to myself believe no lessons
Will be learned because I got my bike fixed
Still smokin' major joints I call one of my hoes
Because I'm ready to serve somethin' 
Let her rent it for the night go to wasteland that's nothin'
So I'm headed cross the river decided to catch this fuckin' ferry
There's this freaky bitch plus she gay but she not scary
This bitch I'm talkin' about she had the gift she wouldn't stop
I had to make it back to her house to make her scream and shout
I'm comin' real hard but I'm a man and still in charge (where you at)
On Manhattan Vapor I'm full of that fuckin' weed thinkin' about her
On her knees not only for my keys but for her keys
I took a shout from on over because I ran a red light
Once again I'm in that world with that weed on my bike
Well

Chorus:

Well one of my fuckin' boys
Packed and scope a nigga named Mike
I'm a long way from home and don't see nothin' in sight
I got to hike(hzike) hike(hzike) hike(hzike) hike(hzike)
Hike(hzike) hike(hzike) hike(hzike)
(2x)

Third Verse:
{Yella Boy}

Now the year is 94 I got a chance to ride a polo
I'm bout to get that bitch fixed up and make in gangster on you hoes
I took a ride to the Eagle scope another bitch how ever  
Four in the mornin' I got breakfast at eleven
I'm chillin' real solo gettin' full of that grits and cheese
I hope this hoe don't burn me because I'm not bout no damn desiese
I jetted down Chef try to get to Donald Five she rode behind the wheel
I hit the gear and broke my tire's pump up in my hand
Look for me if you dare i pop my fuckin' trunk
Somebody stole my damn spare 
The law didn't catch him he was smooth like a cat
The nine would have popped him a left him lyin' on his back
Pussy come Pussy go I got to learn to leave it 
That's what I get for always try'na be greedy
Well

Chorus:

Well one of my fuckin' boys
Packed and scope a nigga named Mike
I'm a long way from home and don't see nothin' in sight
I got to hike(hzike) hike(hzike) hike(hzike) hike(hzike)
Hike(hzike) hike(hzike) hike(hzike)
