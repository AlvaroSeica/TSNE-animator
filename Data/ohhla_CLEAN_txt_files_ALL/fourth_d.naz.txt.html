[Movie Intro]
yo my man what you think I am starvation army? you don't pay you don't play!
(Comne on man) Hey you heard what the man said, you don't have any cash so
take a walk
Meanwhile we got some business to discuss
I got some special chips for you, yeah just like I promised
Your gonna love them. (Thanks) Hey remember there's only enough for you!

[Salute Da Kidd]
Salute! Got the hoody on on this oneyesiirrrr, come on..

When the goons come out, it's an open invitation
The calm delete'll mute any situation
Shit so amazing comin from all ways in
Open the door or we gon chop it down blazin (blaaah)
Whoever inside getting smacked with the axe
Real hard to crack a case without a witness intact
I know my niggas got my back so I act how I act
Unjust in the world where it's hard to relax
A lot of niggas full of raps, me I'm filled with the facts
I don't mean mickey D's when I talk big macs
For the sauce damn right I'll put a split in your nugget
Fuck private, street niggas always go public
Pair of dice where it's at? All I know is the gutter
How to get it in, ski mask wait for the butter
Tend to day dream, sailing off far on the coast
but the hood's where I'm at cause they need me the most
Spark the roach just to smoke like I'm low on the weed
Do it big but the little things matter to me
Keep cash but never known to boast or brag
Street credit real good altered beast in the lab
Sixteens I could spit from the lips or the hip
So my advice pipe down with that touch man shit
From the zoo black bars we surrounded by brick
Specialize in hitting licks and that hustlin shit
See ya freak on her feet for taking one in the head
Real niggas don't die, that's why my nigga aint dead
We survive through all the trials, play through the hard fouls
Where I'm from even little niggas loose like bowels  muthafuck uh
yeah uh yuo yop yup yup Salute nigga yup yup

[Bronze Nazareth]
Yeah yo it get no better than fourth down to me
Don't matter to me ahh ahh yo yo
It gets no better than 4th down, king with a 4 pound
Plus an addition of it, pistol whip him til he plummet
Simmer hell hole, smell of gold when I rummage
Chop the charts holy, prayers leaking all from it
Nadir to the summit, play numbers for the luggage
Under Robocop femurs, guns inside the speaker
Titatium plans, pick diamonds outta ether
Smoke until I hear severe sirens from the reefer
Pious league leader, with my eye on the heater
Through the scope got my eye on the sparrow,
Survive narrow, thru crashing hallways of ammo
When the plot thickens, more rot between victims
Plots form under the radar when blocks blisterin
Still ya'll, friendly game of baseball we pitchin
you still fall travel with ill thought
George bush when the music calls
Finger on the button I'ma use it this fall
Atomic abusive napalm, spray ya graveyard

[Kevlaar 7]
Lone wolf speech camouflaging sheep
Easy way out where the silencers reach
Dig a grave out everytime the violence'll peak
EQ leviatate, skull bone metal plate
Superhere since fetal all time great
Al Kaline the canine crossbreeding your fate
False preaching and hate, left the table I'm hungry
Your dinner is ate, I'm a thirsty fish
Kris my philosophy, no one's stopping me
Unless the devil got metal bars surrounding me
Perform a spinal tap on the cell block floor
Laser incision scription burnt around the door
Warp time to drum lines it's time for war
Fools get your bugles, this one's civil
You dummies just watch and try and solve this riddle
Stars with all the shine always die in the middle

[Phillie]
Home is where we roll
Who really knows what lies ahead
My city groans when semis blow and niggas lie dead
Aint no coming back, yeah I got more trust in my gat
My heart's stuck in winter mode like where is summer at?
In the hood crops don't sprout, flowers don't bud
It rains pain for days instead of showers of love
No glory, no wonder why there's no hope in the slums
No hope for a bum who's somebody's son
Homeless no doubt, no route to follow a lead
America's disease rats with top model esteem
This the slums, how you gonna follow a dream
Grammed and bagged it, simply on my mathematics
Understanding the tears underhanded my past peers
So they fall for the same fears I endured for years
Be wise my child, seek all there is to gain
Remain steadfast refrain far from foolish games
This leopard's grown his spots he can't change
A product of the same mainframe that made slaves</pre>
