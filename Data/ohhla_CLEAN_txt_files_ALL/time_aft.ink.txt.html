[Intro]
Yeah... yeah
Yeahhhhhhh~! Tell 'em

[Chorus: K-Young]
When you call, I will answer
In the miiid-night hour
I will, I will yeah
If you fall I will catch you I'll be waiting
Time after time
The love that we makin is so amazing
Time after time
I save all my kisses for you (yup, yup, yup)
I said I save all my kisses for you
I will be waiting - time after time

[Kid Ink]
Yo - you're the woman that I write to
Know a lot done changed since high school
Still haven't met nobody like you
Finally seein "Black &amp; White" like Michael
Uhh, maybe the time wasn't right then
But times has change and we can try again
This feelin that I'm feelin so timeless
Girl no matter what time it is

[Chorus]

[Kid Ink]
Call me, whenever girl
I've been tryin to get it like a metaphor
Get it? I think you ready for
Get your feet wet, I can make it rainstorm
Yup~! I know we been around the block
like a ice cream truck, damn - it's been so long
Where did all the time go?
I think we need a timer

[Chorus]

[Kid Ink]
You remember the first time?
I made it feel like the first time
Heh; and now we back at it
"Scream" - I'ma take a stab at it
Kill it 'til the mornin
I said hit it til the moanin - get it?
Whenever you're lonely
You know where the phone is

[Chorus]</pre>
