[Wafeek]
Bein the motherfucker in everything I ever dreamed of baby
And maybe even a little more than that, just a little bit mo'
Yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah
Give it to me now

[Chorus]
Now ever since I can remember I been boppin yo' momma
Boppin, boppin yo' momma; boppin yo' momma
Ever since I can remember had the keys to yo' house
Let myself in, Wafeek up in there now!

[Wafeek]
Yeah, now
Now my story is legit, ma and this is not a cover
or another sitcom, this is "How I Met Your Mother"
Workin on the strip, mind in my bid'ness, when this women
told me God as my witness that she wanted someone younger
And yo' momma is a MILF, I was on her in a hot sec
Nuttin better than a grown woman wantin hot sex
Back to my project, so that I could put it on her
First she was my sweetheart, now she like my sugar momma
Once she got the concept, damn she was wildin
While yo' folks is goin broke, I was spendin yo' allowance
We be chillin on the island, me and her, on a nice resort
After her divorce you know I'm spendin up the child support
Not to mention alimony and they settled out of court
Feeky be the foulest homey don't, act like y'all ain't know
If I want the 3-way I'm gettin wit'cha sister
While your momma take the pictures I'll be givin her the snifter

[Chorus]

"She had sex with my momma!"
"Big name rap artists are under arrest in seperate incidents"
"Find out what they're accused of doing"
"This was a day to stop thinking about making records"
"and start worrying about making bail"</pre>
