[Chorus - spoken in Tagalog]
Lapit mga kaibigan at makinig kayo! (Listen up y'all)
Ako'y may dala-dalang
Balita galing sa bayan ko. (Listen closely y'all)
Nais kong ipamahagi ang mga kuento
Ang mga pangyayaring nagaganap
Sa lupang pinangako

[Translation:
Come together my friends and listen up
I've brought news from my native land
I would like to share stories
About how we live and what goes on
From my beloved homeland]

[Verse One: Apl.De.Ap]
Every place got a ghetto this is my version of it
Check it out..
Listen closely yo, I got a story to tell
A version of my ghetto where life felt for real
Some would call it hell but to me it was heaven
God gave me the grace, amazin' ways of living
How would you feel if you had to catch your meal
Build a hut to live and to eat and chill in?
Having to pump the water outta the ground
The way we put it down utilizing what is around
Like land for farming, river for fishing
Everyone helpin' each other whenever they can
We makin' it happen, from nothin' to somethin'
That's how we be survivin' back in my homeland

[Chorus]

[Verse Two: Apl.De.Ap]
Yo, its been a while but..
I been back home to my homeland, (check it out) to see what's going on
Man it feels good to be back at home
And it's been a decade, on the journey all alone
I was fourteen when I first left Philippines
I've been away half my life, but it felt like a day
To be next to my mom with her home cooked meal
Meant I felt complete, my emotions I feel!
Now life has changed for me in the U.S
But back at home man, life was a mess..
I guess sometimes life's stresses gets you down
On your knees, oh brother I wish I could have helped you out..

[Chorus]

Help me, help me, help me, help me, help me, help me... {*fades out*}</pre>
