[Intro: Truck (Apocalipps)]
Aiyo, tell us what the fuck happ', aiyo, tell us what happen
Aiyo, God, what the fuck happen to them, these niggas is wild, son
These niggas is fucking crazy, son
(Yo, let me tell ya'll what happen, yo) Tell 'em yo

[Apocalipps] (Truck)
Aiyo, I load up the glock, called up top, we in the drop top
Cruising the street (and what you do?)
Yo, I saw this dude, with a diamond Jesus, he look sweet to me
(Did you get that nigga, Lipps?)
I pulled up, and blast the heater on him (what else)
Get up, I wish they'd warn him (hahaha)
I got plans to put my steel in places
I've never seen, Truck, you know what I mean?

[Truck]
Man, give me your watch, nigga, give me that chain
Matter fact, give me them trees, shit, I'm taking that range
And if your bitch look good, shit we fucking that dame

[Hook: Apocalipps]
I just wanna see you take it off

[Bless]
Blast that, put it in his mouth til it click back
Tie him to the boat to Manhattan, til we get back
He's our first contestant, to rock a shit hat

[Hook]

[Apocalipps]
I'm like Deniro in this shit, cuz I don't want no trouble
But if you, test my gun, I will, pop your bubble
And I run through niggas hood, like Cornelius Bennett
And I snatch a nigga ear off with the booger still in it

[Truck]
You either gonna be a thug or just stay in the books
Cuz when them guns come out, you gon' respect the juks
I got a dead arm, nigga, respect this hook

[Hook]

[Truck]
You know what this is, fuck that, lay face down
I'm not a DP, but I do a shakedown
Attempted murder, hit a nigga from his waist down
Lipps show us, with ya brother how you do clowns

[Apocalipps]
I might know the streets, know the rules, know that I'm packing
And know, when to move, cuz I rob you for practice
And don't pump-fake, why not? You'll have the pump in your face
Police'll find your body slumped in the lake
And yall you dudes rocking fake shit, I ain't gon' lie
I'd even yapp you for that bullshit if it catch my eye
Long John Wayne pistol, steady bumping my thigh
And if you, call my bluff once, you gon' die

[Bless]
Aiyo, fuck the law, I put the forty to your jaw
Take all your money, buy a forty from the store
Get yapped if you move wrong, get clapped if you move wrong
Whoever coming with me, get the fuck in the Yukon
I'm about to lay a nigga down like a newborn
Now put your shoes on, now nigga, move on
Braow, nigga, move on, bow, nigga, move on</pre>
