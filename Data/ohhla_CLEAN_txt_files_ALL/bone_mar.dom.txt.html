Terrorist shit nigga!

(Hook)
Yo, somebody please tell these fuckers I'm back
Somebody please tell these fuckers I'm back, I'm back
Somebody please tell these fuckers I'm back
Somebody please tell these fuckers I'm back, I'm back
Somebody please tell these fuckers I'm back
Somebody please tell these fuckers I'm back, I'm back
Somebody please tell these fuckers I'm back

[Dom Pachino]
Ayo, somebody please tell these fuckers I'm back on my guerilla shit
The militant mastermind, back crack your spine
If you really love hip-hop than get on the line
Pay the price; get ya tickets, and ta-dah
And see ya boy shine
You get chills when you entered the building
Niggas was ice grilling
Tonight it might be your killing, I'm feeling
Lil ivy off the bottle I just snuck past security
Walking, first nigga I've seen I robbed recently
Yeah, that's the type of night it was
Might end in the precinct
Tonight, niggas is indecent, the scene is facetious
But, you know I gotta stomach for it
And a big hammer for the War Report
Hold court, hold fort
Anywhere is a sport; I'm the judge and the jury
The pain and the fury
The Rome, wanna fuck with y'all niggas, ya better hear me
Thanks, and best wishes with love sincerely
With love sincerely

[Break]

[Dom Pachino]
Ayo I'm back and better than ever
I bring the terror like bad weather
Y'all niggas lightweight like a feather
I'm Larenz Tate with the war paint
And the black leather
Tryna get these dead prez, no matter what ever
Get splatter for cheddar, there's rats on my sweater
That get brushed off and poison with these raps that'll get 'em
That's if the lead and my straps didn't hit 'em
Fo' smack niggas be spitting and have blood on my mittens
I rap for a living, these raps that you're giving is like prime rib
That's if you're cooking beef in the kitchen
And niggas is snitching, got you killing</pre>
