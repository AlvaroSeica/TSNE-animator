Yeah, yeah... Right...
Hot, damn! ..It sounds so rugged
No glitz, no glam, just that low budget
It sounds so bugged, my own fam don't want it
"Print, there's no drums, man I can't flow on it!"
No worries, my man, I'm bout to go for it
Soon as you said, "No thanks!", I had a song for it
I see my fans sleepin, I see emcees snorin
So nine out of ten, I'm takin weird over boring
Records ain't sellin, all the stores closin
Can't make a living 'less you on that road tourin
Fans are singin that the underground ain't worth exploring!
Cats that used to bring the heat now they all dormant
We don't drop enough, they want it more often
It's too watered down, they want it more potent
It ain't strong enough, they want more dosage
They want it uncut, I'll leave 'em overdosin!!

Uh-hah...
I don't want it all, just a small portion
Somethin cool with a view and a small office
It ain't like I'ma really be there all that often
Prol'ly in Colorado chasin broads snowboardin
Or out in Salt Lake ballin like John Stockton
Record shoppin, breakin bread with some cool Mormons
I wanna look back and laugh at my old struggles
Things I used to trip about don't even seem important
So 'til he get his, it's gon' be hard to stop him
Even though he know it's "more money, more prol'lems"
But for him, it's really "more money, more options"
Cause at least he can escape 'em all by goin shopping
But we don't drop enough, they want it more often
It's too watered down, they want it more potent
It ain't strong enough, they want more dosage
They want it uncut, I'LL LEAVE 'EM OVERDOSIN~!!!</pre>
