Most Wanted presents Kane and Abel
My nigga from the basement on the beat
Get your mind right BITCH!

(Chorus)  (2x)

Get your mind right ya dig ya heard me bruh
Get your mind right ya dig ya heard me bitch
Get your mind right ya dig ya heard me bruh
Get your mind right ya dig ya heard me

(verse 1)

It's your boys Kane &amp; Abel we need no introduction
Known world wide to get them niggas buck jumpin'
Keep the club bumpin' til it's hype hype
Get that mind right
We rollin' with some killers that'll put it in your life
Alright we down south hustlin'
Niggas steady bustin'
Got the trunk shakin' like you broke somethin' when we cussin'
My hood to your hood get the tape let it blast
When you up to no good with the black ski mask
That ass might be next if you niggas don't respect us
Get your head bust if you ever try to check us
Ridin' with them thangs so pigs wanna arrest us
Ya dig Ya heard
That's how we talk in the third
And give a fuck when we com get out the way you'll get mixed on
We sick sick keep a extra clip if it's on
Let it be buckin' at the enemies
Strictly bout that combat if you ain't strapped then you better be

(Chorus) (2x)

(Verse 2)

Uh oh it's me again on the fukin' beat again
Pull out my heat all you creeps gon' retreat again
You got no balls talkin' shit with glass jaws
You gon' stop pause and shit in your drawers
I take it to the streets 'fore they take it to me
And make my way hustlin' on the block with D
Comin' from the gumbo where the choppers blow
Niggas senior citizens at the age of 24
Nigga what you know? only what i've seen
And when the mack 10 screams
There goes your dreams
Go on 'bout your business if your quick with your lips
Cause when I hit you with this you gon' toss your grits
Comin' out the dirty south where playes pick they caskets
The one with the mouth run the fastest
When I blast this
We got our own thangs
So respect the game
Or take ten steps turn around and bang ya heard me

(chorus)  (4x)</pre>
