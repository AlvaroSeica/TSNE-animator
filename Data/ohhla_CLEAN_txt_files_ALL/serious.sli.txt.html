Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Cause life ain't no jokin business
This life ain't no jokin business

Cause I'm I'm a serious man
No don't be gossip with them heathens
Me I'm a serious man
Seem like the trouble it go for them
Me I'm a serious man
No don't be sitting with them heathen
Me I'm a serious man that's what I am

And I won't laugh and take life for a joke noo-ho-ho
Then watch poor people life go up in smoke
And I don't feel that we gonna take this (on) I said no
We need to have praise in god
For our life is joy

So I'm I'm a serious man
No don't be gossip with no heathens
Me I'm a serious man
Seem like more trouble agian for them
Me I'm a serious man
No don't be sitting with them heathen
Me I'm a serious man that's what I am

And I won't live oh for political ideology no ho ho
No value in dollars and the faith in economy
And I don't laugh and take this thing for fun I said no
We need to have praise in god
For our life is joy

So I'm I'm a serious man
No don't be sitting with them heathens
Me I'm a serious man
Seem like the trouble agian for them
Me I'm a serious man
No don't be gossip with no heathens
Me I'm a serious man that's what I am

Cause life ain't no jokin business

Nooooo no life ain't no jokin business

Cause I'm I'm a serious man
No don't be gossip with them heathens
Me I'm a serious man
Seem like the trouble agian for them
Me I'm a serious man
No don't be gossip with the heathens
Me I'm a serious man that's what I am</pre>
