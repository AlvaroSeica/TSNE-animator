"Breaking new story, just bringing you up to date"
"Across the U.S., as the country's economy continues to plunge"
"Now some are so outraged, they're doing something about it"
"And Congress is proposing new taxes"
"Symbols remind you of the toll the ongoing wars have taken on our country"

[B Real w/ Sen Dog in background]
Shut 'em down, shut 'em down
Shut 'em down, yeah we shut 'em down
We shut 'em down, shut 'em down
Shut 'em down, yeah we shut 'em down

[Sen Dog]
Shut the shit down from the motherfuckin' get go
Hand around ya neck and I'm refusing to let go
I'm like a down south crooked ass police
Gettin' some of everything down to ya show biz
See they got me, straight goin' off gee
Goin' buck wild swingin' on the paparazzi
We not done, this shit ain't over
Guess what we're back with a nation of soldiers
And we ain't havin' it, we takin' over kid
Comin' through with the cannabis odor shit
I think you all know, we rock the good show
Hand on the mic like Billy Bonney and a pistol

[B Real]
Bail out, shut 'em down
Wall Street, shut 'em down
Laid off, we shut 'em down, yeah we shut 'em down
All wars, we shut 'em down
Politicians, shut 'em down
Wiretaps, shut 'em down, yeah we shut 'em down

[B Real]
Lookin' down the crossroads, feelin' kinda lost
No way to make a mistake and take me for a lost soul
I don't want your sympathy, I don't need your handout
Never had it planned out, the system cut your man out
Wars on the newscast, caught another news flash
Heard about a new tax, what if I refuse that
I don't want your promises, I don't need your bullshit
I don't need you tellin' me the answers at the pulpit
Set up on the meltdown, hunted by the hellhounds
Liars got you spellbound, get up if you fell down
I don't hear your slick talk, I don't see your point of view
I'm the fuckin' thorn in your side keeps annoying you

[B Real]
Crooked cops, shut 'em down
Drug laws, shut 'em down
Higher taxes, shut 'em down, yeah we shut 'em down
False media, shut 'em down
The common enemy, shut 'em down
Hypocrites, shut 'em down, yeah we shut 'em down

(Percussion and guitar)
(Guitar Solo)

[B Real]
Guantanamo, shut 'em down
War criminals, shut 'em down
These individuals, shut 'em down, yeah we shut 'em down
One agenda, shut 'em down
No surrender, shut 'em down
By any means, shut 'em down, yeah we shut 'em down

[B Real and Sen Dog]
Shut 'em down, shut 'em down
Shut 'em down, yeah we shut 'em down
Shut 'em down, shut 'em down
Shut 'em down, yeah we shut 'em down</pre>
