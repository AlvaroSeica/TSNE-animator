[Intro: T.I.]
Uh-huh, ay count that money for me partner
Ay Ross make sure that nigga got that shit right, ya hear me?
Ay, when that muh'fucker go ding ("J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League")
{*ding*} That's 150 thou', yeah
That shit should add up to 'bout 5.4 man
I'll be right back, I'm finna go get dressed
Uh-huh, tell nigga gas up the jet

[Chorus: T.I.]
I stay on my grind cause that come first
If he get outta line his feelings finna get hurt
All that's on my mind is get that dough
You try me I'ma take you places you don't wanna go
50, 60 stacks or mo' and I'm in yo' town
Just to shake a booty hole, butt finna go down
Hear that click-clack roll, better get back fast
At attention when you see me, pledge allegiance to the swag
Pledge allegiance to the swag - ay pledge allegiance to the swag
Pledge allegiance to the swag - yeah pledge allegiance to the swag
I pledge allegiance to the swag - I pledge allegiance to the swag
I pledge allegiance to the swag, pledge allegiance to the swag
Pledge allegiance to the swag

[T.I.]
Ay, I do my thang, you don't know?
Off the muh'fuckin chain, play the game how it go
I ain't in a gang, still I'm a problem on the low
Whip them thangs well, just know I know who got it for the low
Triple O.G. so, sucka free, I, swear
You don't know me homie, you can get the fuck from round here
I don't care, who you is, who you with or who you know
Let's be clear, I'm a muh'fuckin G and you a hoe
Keep that Remy XO, poured up, bankroll swole up
Smell money in the air soon as I roll up
Heyyyyy, I'm the coolest in the city bitch
While you lames trippin on that goofy stupid silly shit
Ha ha ha, who you ever seen it really did?
Super fly filthy rich, illy with a killer shit
Came in this bitch with my ego and got cash
I demand you to raise yo' hand and pledge allegiance to the swag nigga

[Chorus]

[Rick Ross]
Rozay! Rozay! Rozay!
T.I., I got you nigga!
These other motherfuckers gotta bow down

Brown bag of money, call me David Copperfield
A bitch'll disappear, Lord a bitch'll disappear
We control the corners, that's usual politics
Push a button from the mansion, hit you with a hollow tip
We two different niggaz, I'm servin, he sniffin his
And I love that new Bugatti how that bitch be shiftin gears
Movin how I move I fuck with a selected few
Aviators and Audemars, the bezel fluorescent blue
Down South nigga had to climb up out the barrel
Outfox these niggaz, now we rock out on apparel
Pledge allegiance to the swag cause this shit is top notch
Jumpin in and out of bitches like I'm playin hopscotch
Jumpin in and out of sixes like I got a car lot
And I got the type of digits that your bitch'll dial by, die by
Young niggaz bow down to the kings
In the presence of a don, pay respect, kiss my ring

[Chorus] w/ ad libs

[T.I.]
Ay, ay the Enzo off set, neck, wrist frostbit
Deal ain't a hundred mil', ya ain't talkin 'bout shit
Nigga wanna beef he get the whole cow quick
If you talkin 'bout some paper step into my office - baow!
On some penthouse shit, rentin out chicks
Fuck 'em from behind they be spittin out dick - blaow!
Excuse me now but if I may make an announcement
Don't smoke no mo' but when I did I was blowin ounces
of gas, ask the feds what I had when they found me
We down with whatever, just don't interrupt my countin
Ballin on a daily basis, call my accountant
Only time you make it rain's throwin change in a fountain
Flow sick, crazy, deranged, need counsellin
He say I ain't all that, she say I'm astoundin
Them lames out, G's in, square's out of season
When you see my swag nigga pledge yo' allegiance!

[Chorus]

[Outro: T.I.]
Ay my nigga I'm talkin stars and stripes, youknow'msayin?
