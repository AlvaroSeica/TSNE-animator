[Intro]
Yeah, greetings to you all
We came millions of miles to be here with you tonight
And we're going to bring a man up to the microphone
Right now that goes by the name of, uhhh
Well he doesn't know.

[Verse]
Shape-shifting, uplifting
Lyrical being, here to terminate the bling bling
Six millions ways to live - choose none
The devil's both left and right, confusion
A new son, a new earth has begun
Metabolical rates are changing, rearranging
This rhyme is entertaining
And visually stimulating, like an impressionist painting
Oooh, yo come follow me
What's the definition of a real MC?
Is it looking hard on MTV?
Or freestyling in a backstreet alley?
Mohammed, it's the return of the comet
I bomb it, these rappers are dropping a Hip Hop Megatron
From King Street to Eglington - we don't run
Cause when they've got a mic there's no need for a gun.

[Hook #1 x2]
And it don't stop, and it don't quit
It sold four to five, so jump on it
And to my people if you love your life, forget the strife
And rock from night until mornin'

[Hook #2 x4]
Get your back up off the wall
Can't afford to miss the boat when they call

[Verse]
If you think about a thought
Then you'll see that you're timeless
I'll still rhyme this, they're asleep like Linus
I find this very stimulating to the mind
But drives me crazy at the same time
Am I this, or that? Human or black?
Extraterrestrial or right side of the tracks?
In fact, the truth itself can be confusive
Here's a little story from my time that's allusive
I knew a girl by the name of Roxanne
Met her in '86 at the local bandstand (What's up?)
New tracksuit, fat laces, white sneakers
Movin' to the sound comin' out of the speaker
Last week around Queen, and John
I saw her at the corner with a business suit on
I said, "What's up girl? You still check the vibe?
Remember De La Soul, Diamond D, and the Tribe?"
She said, "No, no! I just don't listen!
That stuff on the radio's not the transmission
Same beat, same lyrics, same song
I listen to my old school tapes to get it on"
I said, "Word up girl, I know what you mean
It seems were all trapped in the glitz and the gleam
But truth's just hidden for now - so don't sweat it
So here's a cassette," and then I jetted

[Hook #1 x4]
And it don't stop, and it don't quit
It sold four to five, so jump on it
And to my people if you love your life, forget the strife
And rock from night until mornin'

[Hook #2 x4]
Get your back up off the wall
Can't afford to miss the boat when they call

[Outro x2]
Come inside - there's no use hiding
Come inside, the sun is high</pre>
