If you think you can get to me
My minds a door open
Walk right through
Under raise thats how it has to be
I never said I was anything like you

You bring me down, let me out
You bring me down, let me out
 
Sit down beside my ignorance
Nobody loves me like you do
Sick and tired of all the hypocrites
Hate me cuz I'm not like you
 
You bring me down, let me out
You bring me down, let me out
 
Make you judge it just a satisfy
I got you different right here
You can see all the pain in my eyes
Overflowing with tears
 
You bring me down, let me out
You bring me down, let me out
 
My mind is twiztid with these thoughts of you
I just can't be alone
A constant blister when I talk to you
Wish you would leave me alone
 
You bring me down, let me out
You bring me down, let me out
 
Smokin' cigarettes passin' the time
Somehow I'm lonely again
No one knows I'm feelin' deep inside
Maybe if I had a friend
 
You bring me down, let me out
You bring me down, let me out</pre>
