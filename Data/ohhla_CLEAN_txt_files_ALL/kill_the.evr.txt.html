Song:   Kill the Emperor
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Chorus]
I think I would, if I could, kill the emperor
Let's stop the war, and feed the poor, let's kill the emperor
Let's stop the lies, the dead can't rise, silence every mother's cries
I think I would, if I could, kill the emperor

[Everlast]
Yo, it's like Resident Evil, the emperor's people
don't give a mad fuck about yo' life
They'll fuck your wife and your kids, they've got people doin bids
For being slaves to the dope that they supplyin
Still they keep lyin, and tell you that it's some cartel
While they waitin on the heaven they're creatin the hell
And they rape the constitution while you wait in your cell
And for the victors go the spoils and that's oil wells
Call Orson Wells, cause the world's at war
And the frontline's, just outside your front door
Fuck the New York Times, and fuck CNN
And politicians that pretend to be the working man's friend

[Chorus]

[Everlast]
Yo the emperor's a liar, the fields are on fire
Oil prices get higher, time's about to expire
Hurricane Katrina, and Asian tsunamis
Adolescent mommies and high school snipers
Final days are coming, get ready for trial
Americans they live in fifty states of denial
Have a coke and a smile, or some crack in a vial
You can even buy a pill to keep you hard for a while
For these Girls Gone Wild in this world at war
it's the same old whores, it's the new crusade
Yo the plan been made, they lied to invade
I'm on the palace lawn, with my live grenade cause

[Chorus]

[Outro: repeat to fade]
I want peace, but that's illegal
Arrest the President, he's the criminal</pre>
