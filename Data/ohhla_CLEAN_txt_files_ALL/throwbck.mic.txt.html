[Chorus 2X: Iron Mic]
Who the fuck ya'll want? (Iron Mic)
And who the fuck ya'll need? (Iron Mic)
And who the fuck gon' bleed, all ya'll faggots
Cuz none of ya'll niggas can fuck with the Bastardz

[Iron Mic]
For all my real niggas, let me talk to you
Show you how the Staten Island, New Yorkers do
Show 'em how it feel when that burner scorching you
Come through to the wrong hood, man, they torture you
Don't give a fuck this is what, we was taught to do
Get that tux' and that black box brought to you
We don't slapbox, we clap shots off the roof
Hollow tips, turn ya hard top into a coupe
Fake niggas follow, bitches can't swallow the truth
I got my mind on my riches so don't bother me, duke
Take some advice, don't try to take me out my zone
You won't be the first, or the last nigga to feel this chrome
It's similar to the new rims, yo, why's that?
Cuz I after I stop spittin', nigga you still gon' spin
And until I stop living's the only way you'll win
I grab this pen and spit gems, I got 10 years in
With this rap shit, these fake rappers all they do is pretend
Pose like they the real, we much realer than them
Yo, he a Ruthless fan, man, I hear it in him
It's like, superiors what we appearing to them
I said Ruthless, bet you gon' hear it again
He got touched already, he front, he gon' wear it again
We treat 'em like the police, we caging 'em in
And occasionally blazing that, chewing the men
I just fuck with flows, like I fuck with hoes
And give headshots, bullets won't touch ya clothes
Ya'll niggas better bow down, and touch ya toes
We got this shit locked, speak up, if you don't think so, nigga</pre>
