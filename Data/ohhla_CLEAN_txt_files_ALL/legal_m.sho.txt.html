(CHORUS)
Legal murder, legal murder
Doin thangs, doin thangs people never hearda
Legal murder, legal murder
Doin thangs, doin thangs people sometimes hear-a

Murder, the end of another life
By a drunk in a car, or a gun fight
Now thats wrong but the bullshits right
And day by day, we losin more babies lives
Or take another son and send him to a war
To operate a tank, held a chainese and drive a car
And when he get knocked in the rocks
A metal, no money and a God damn box
Or his name on a local station
What good is that when you're on vacation
For good, you'll be missed in your hood
Cause in Iraq, ya break ya back
And still hafta pay for the gas when ya bring yo ass back
Or come back disabled
Your family looks at you to put food on your table
Open the door, there's no food in the fridge
So now you go crazy and jump yo ass off a bridge
And the suburbs is heard of
Its an example of a...legal murder

(CHORUS)

A white cop on a witness stand
He panicked, shot a brother so they called him a dope man
And the public has to take it
Because the only thing we know is whats wrote in the paper
Yo, but let it be the other way around
Let it be the 'wood with his ass on the ground
And then they wanna take action show affection
Lay a brother on a table and inject him
Or maybe spend the rest of his life in jail
With the world the way it is, is there really a hell?
But the pig hadda badge so society makes him right
To take a brother to jail and beat his ass all night
Or pull him over on the freeway
And blow him away for the things he had to say
And when they ask him why he shot a man without a weapon
He'll just say he felt his life was threatened
And the ghetto's is heard of
Its an example of a...legal murder

(CHORUS)

Ya go to the doctor he prescribes ya morphine
You used to be a patient but now you a dope fiend
The women turnin tricks for rocks
And the brotherman will take everything ya got
Now I know I'm gettin deep
But the message I kick is for the people from the street
Now the doctor's a dopeman but he does it classy
Insteada sellin on the corner he slangs from a practice
But he's a family man, a doctor, an M.D.
So he's overlooked by society
He'll just set another fiend on the loose
Some pack a nine, some pack a duece duece
And won't think about pullin that trigger quick
Then bust a cap in yo grill to get the next hit
Or break into a house and beat a lady down
And won't remember when the high comes down
While ya doctor's eatin shrimp and steak
Ya gotta old lady dead and a brand new cell mate
And the ghetto's is heard of
Its an example of a..."example of a what?" legal murder

(CHORUS)

Legal murder legal murder...abortion
Legal murder legal murder...suicide
Legal murder, legal murder...the electric chair
Legal murder, legal murder...child abuse
Legal murder, legal murder...police brutality
Legal murder, legal murder...D.W.I.
Legal murder, legal murder...pawn shops
Legal murder, legal murder...pork chops

(CHORUS)

Legal murder, legal murder...world war
Legal murder, legal murder...oh my Lord

(CHORUS)

Legal murder, legal murder Legal murder, legal murder
Legal murder, legal murder Legal murder, legal murder

Doin thangs, doin thangs, people always hear of</pre>
