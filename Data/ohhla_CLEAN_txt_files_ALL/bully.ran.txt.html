One thing I can't stand is a damn bully
Always picking fights with the weak goodie goodies
Takin lunch money from the kids how could he
Scaring kids worse than the boogie- man, only plan
Was his next victim, his name was woody
Soft as a 3 year old wet pair of footies
Skinny as a rail, with his hair all wooly
Never came to school without his lamb of God hoodie

The bully walks to woody, wit his hand extended fully
Askin what woody got on his lunch goodies
I don't think woody understood the bully fully
Cuz Took too long to respond to his query
Pushed him down in the rain now he all sooty
Reached in his bag and stole is Homemade cookies
Woody looked at the bully like how could he then he
Noticed a rip on his favorite hoody

You never
You never
You never know know know

Pulled himself out the mud, picked up his goodies
Plots his revenge wondrin shouldn't he or should he
Get the bully back and if so How could he
Figure out a way that no one could overlook me
One thing nobody knew about woody
Was his dad just was a cop, though he was still a rookie
Had 2 guns that he hid in the crib,
Left one in the jar that was usually for cookies

all woody wanted was to refill his cookies
That were so callously stolen by the bully
Hand in the cookie jar now lookie lookie
Woody got an answer to his problems with the bully
A shiny new pistol, 44 fully
Automatic weapon is now inside woodys
Backpack wouldn't take the bet as a bookie
I'm guessing this one might not be pretty

Woodys on the school bus Lookin for the bully
Hopin that he maybe played hooky
Or possibly with his friends so they can see the looky
on his face when I take his leverage like a pulley
Woody spots the bully grabs 44 fully
Automatic pistol, says you didn't really have to push me
Or rip my hoodie or take my cookies
One Shot to the chest down went he bully</pre>
