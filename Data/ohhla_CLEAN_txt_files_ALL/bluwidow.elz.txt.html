[Intro: The Moments sample]
What is your name?
I wanna talk to you
If I can, I can, I can, I can...

[Elzhi]
I blow a blunt of blue widow, listenin to instrumentals
in a five-star suite with pay fo' incidentals
Hoppin out of cars that, yours convinces rentals
I'm what's happenin for a reason, there's no coincidentals
I'm honestly the best, anyone in your dynasty can test
and get chewed like how piranhas eat the flesh
Pretend that, I ain't in fact, comin off like a thin hat
where strong wind at, soon as I, lay the pen flat
It's certi-fied murder, I decide
Further your fate with nickel-plate side burners
Bang bang~! to all my foes, leave 'em froze off of dros
My flows keep niggaz on they toes like orang-tans
and roadrunners, I erase 'em like old numbers in the celly
I push Perrellis on gold Hummers
Get bread and dip from the scene, like it was cold hummers
The devil tryna take our souls that we hold from us
It's a gamble, but still I chose to roll the dice
Cause my cold world fits like hell, frozen over twice
I came from the bottom just to spit it from the top
of the fitted, sicker than a clinic with the pox
and the mumps and the measles, throw pumps at the
chumps and the weasels, blowin tree stumps of the diesel

[Chorus: The Moments sample]
What is your name?
I wanna talk to you
If I can, I can, I can, I can..

[Elzhi]
Set the track into flame, back in the game, packin the same
two guns that I stuck to with accurate aim
And since I only got, one shot to blow, I'm not missin
Next rhyme I jot'll be on the yacht, while cot fishin
Niggaz is twat and they should squat pissin
Cause who I spot dissin often switch up the story 
like where the plot's twisten
They know about, how I light 'em up and blow 'em out
Like a blizzy in the Benzy, gettin Lewinski
and +Lohan+, like Lindsay, I cause a frenzy
As long as the world spins me, around
You know I stay, gunnin for the throne
Lickin rounds at the crown
You dumbfound, all of these bums is thumbs-down

[Chorus]</pre>
