Song:   What My Future Holds
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
I want my momma living good
And when I make it
I'm a get my niggaz out the hood
Days go by and I'm growing old
Man I don't know what my future holds

[Verse 1]
Funny how I grew up
Lot of things changed over the years
Since I blew up
I just want a girl that
Ain't no rapper mess with
I ain't tripping I am just chilling
Counting all these blessings
I done seen rappers lose it all
Then they hit rock bodem
Then we never find these niggaz like osama binladen
And the rate that I'm going and the way that I am living
I don't see me having anything in my life I ain't vision
Now I'm cruisin on a mission
Searchin for some peace of life
Cause this rap shit will have your ass thinking twice
I don't wanna be the only one ridin bentley coup's
I wanna make sure that all my partners stuntin to

[Chorus]
I want my momma living good
And when I make it
I'm a get my niggaz out the hood
Days go by and I'm growing old
Man I don't know what my future holds

I want my momma living good
And when I make it
I'm a get my niggaz out the hood
Days go by and I'm growing old
Man I don't know what my future holds

[Verse 2]
I'm sayin they got me thinking is her eyes open
Living in this cold world tryin to remain focus
I just wanna know will I be a better man than my father was
And I'm just droppin for change just like obama does
Tryin to get all of my priorities together
Can't be in the club throwing ones at hoes forever
I just hope that I exceed and succeed to my highest hights
Fucked up they ain't got my people living right
Goverment still playing tricks on us
Why feel like they put a hoax on us
Leavin us to starve don't provide jobs then we gon rob (that's true)

[Chorus]
I want my momma living good
And when I make it
I'm a get my niggaz out the hood
Days go by and I'm growing old
Man I don't know what my future holds

I want my momma living good
And when I make it
I'm a get my niggaz out the hood
Days go by and I'm growing old
Man I don't know what my future holds

This is for my niggaz fresh out I know it's hard
If you don't provide jobs then a nigga gon rob
Have a family to feed can't let em starve
We cryin out for help but gettin no response

[Chorus]
I want my momma living good
And when I make it
I'm a get my niggaz out the hood
Days go by and I'm growing old
Man I don't know what my future holds

I want my momma living good
And when I make it
I'm a get my niggaz out the hood
Days go by and I'm growing old
Man I don't know what my future holds</pre>
