[Intro]
(tunes...) (4x)
yo, you know
life's about stories, one man told me...
we all got one
drop...

(tunes...) (4x)
uh
you know what it is
it's the tones baby
(we get it)
(tunes...) (4x)
check this out...

[Verse 1]
yo, you gotta guy going down the street, cuz he gotta go
but who knows if he'll make going 90 down the road
he's swirving...
to the left...
and to the right...
passing up these people like, a thief rook in the night
just happened to look at him, when he passed me on by
his look said lost, but that search was in his eye
he looked a little older, maybe pushing 40
i didn't see no malt liquor, but i seen a story
the ending, no one knows
and always to the second
but what i seen just had to be enough to give a blessing
if you don't make a move, you only waste your time
forever is a long time, don't take long to find
in his case he was old, know he's gotta goal
his younger years have disappeared, bunch was on a roll
but slangin' rocks and licking knots was tiring to his soul
the benz that he just copped, wasn't enough to make him whole

[chorus]
searching, searching for you...
(tunes...) (4x) 
searching, searching for you... (3x)
(tunes...) (4x)
searching, searching for you...
(i don't have nothing for you)

[Verse 2]
yeah
there once was a man, plushed in his hand
was his gun, he was lost like dust in the sand
though he sold death, to his customers hand
he could hold his breath, god touch him again
once in a plan, blueberry moon
twice in a lifetime, three times to soon
four more years more fears more tears
five lives left no peers all despair
so hopeless, he survive mo' death
he sleep so long, but he got no rest
could he take six steps back into time
he could figure out what he lacked in his life
but he took too long, his son turned seven
running in his fathers' flames, hard to see heaven
now he's back where he's still, with his best to this metal
realizing for much less, he would settle...
searching...

[chorus]
searching, searching for you...
(tunes...) (4x) 
searching, searching for you... (3x)
(tunes...) (4x)
searching, searching for you...
(i don't have nothing for you)

(tunes...) (4x)
