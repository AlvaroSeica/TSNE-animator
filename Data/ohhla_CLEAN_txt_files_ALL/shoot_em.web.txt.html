[Intro]
Put your controllers in the air
Ha-ha, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Call of Duty, online, baby, let's get it poppin'
They try to step to me with the head shot got 'em
I'm something like the best at a team death-match
Rusher of the Middle East, take it to the next map
Dope attacks to blow your back with
A natural born Soap MacTavish
Scope and blast it
It won't be an open casket, don't care
There ain't no love this is Modern Warfare

[Chorus]
'Cos I shoot 'em up, shoot 'em up, WHAT!
None of you motherfuckers want war with me
'Cos I shoot 'em up, shoot 'em up, WHAT!
Xbox to the PS3
'Cos I shoot 'em up, shoot 'em up, WHAT!
Head-shot from the sniper rifle, MG
'Cos I shoot 'em up, shoot 'em up, WHAT!
Murder all you bitches in that COD

[Verse 2]
You couldn't see me with a UAV
Or a heartbeat sensor on your SMG
It's COD, and see you could never stop me
Dropping competition like a fucking Nazi Zombie
I'm cocky, ain't nobody's messing when he's on
I'm the reason you're whole team is getting respawned
Your a pawn, get powned when I come attacked with
My bluetooth and ear, always talking mad shit
Flashbang, grenades and knife 'em all day
PS3 to Xbox, can't stay away
BANG, then I put another in your brain
Burn these motherfuckers with the napalm flame
And then I

[Chorus]
Shoot 'em up, shoot 'em up, WHAT!
None of you motherfuckers want war with me
'Cos I shoot 'em up, shoot 'em up, WHAT!
Xbox to the PS3
'Cos I shoot 'em up, shoot 'em up, WHAT!
Head-shot from the sniper rifle, MG
'Cos I shoot 'em up, shoot 'em up, WHAT!
Murder all you bitches in that COD

[Outro]
Shoot 'em up, shoot 'em up [x2]</pre>
