[J. Cole]
Okay I lied, uh-huh

Motherfucker try and say I can't come to the hood, true lie
See I would but I'm out in Dubai
When I get back I'ma roll through that
Snatch yo' bitch, give yo' niggaz dap
The hood gon' ballistic
"Cole was here and you missed it
That nigga walk like Obama man
Shake yo' momma hand and then kissed it"
This pimp shit, this pimp shit
Cole hard, you limp dick
My flow hard, no wimp shit
Put in that work, no temp shit
Yo' bitch wearin that lipstick
Gave this dick a french kiss
That nigga's so wack when the bitch came back
He kissed her hopin that it get him sick
Ha, ain't that some shit?
Well paid from this rappin shit
Ville made it to the map and shit
Niggaz move 'caine like Kappa shit
Can't map this shit
From no bedsprings in my mattresses
To fuckin these bad little actresses
I'm bad as shit, ha

[Chorus: J. Cole]
I got that work, say what?
My flow, say what?
My bitches, say what?
You cold, say what?
I said say what, ain't that some shit?
Well paid from this rappin shit
Say what, ain't that some shit?
Well paid from this rappin shit
Say what, ain't that some shit?
Well paid from this rappin shit
Say what, ain't that some shit?
Bitch~! Bounce, bounce, bounce
Bounce (bounce) bounce (bounce)
Bounce (bounce) bounce

[J. Cole]
Flow, flow, flow, flow
Flow tight, put a nigga in a headlock
Fuck hoes out of wedlock, make her bed rock
Red hot, so they got red dots
Pullin that trigger nigga better be a head shot
Money long like dreadlocks, shit
If you send shots then you bet' not miss
For a couple G's, send a couple G's
Fuck coppin pleas, Matlock shit
(Testify) I gotta testify
Came through humble so it's best if I
explain the newer shit, rockin jewels shit
Got the full clip, cock and pull shit
Stop the bullshit, watch the flow
How you gon' stop the unstoppable?
Keep niggaz on they toes, no Dr. Scholl's
It's the Roc bitch, rock and roll

[Chorus]

[Outro: J. Cole]
My nigga Syience killed this motherfuckin beat man
Huh, bounce</pre>
