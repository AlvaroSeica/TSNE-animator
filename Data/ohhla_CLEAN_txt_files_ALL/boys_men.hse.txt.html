[Intro] [Blueprint]
One two. One two. Yeah, yeah. Right
 
[Chorus] [Illogic &amp; Blueprint]
They out here playin' with pen
They out here frontin' for they friends
But Greenhouse bring it to an end with this gem
We separate the boys from the men
 
[Verse One] [Illogic]
Truthfully, I don't know what dudes be on
What delusions of grandeur they feedin' themselves
Thinkin' that they really do this but never dropped a record ever
On-line mixtapes can't be seen on shelves
They don't give peace where peace is due
Wouldn't know stats if stats smacked 'em across the grill
See the difference between me and you
I earn respect, there's a reason that people call me Ill
I came up in Groove Shack, Bernies and Thieves World
The Expo, the Rhino, carvin' my name out
Shuttin' crews down with the Weightless sound
To the point where cats were scared to show they face out
I work too hard for you to dismiss my stat sheet
Toured the country sellin' records, you ain't left the state
I don't open for people unless they out sellin' me
So until you doin' that just get out my face
 
[Chorus] [Blueprint &amp; Illogic]
They out here playin' with pen
They out here frontin' for they friends
But Greenhouse bring it to an end with this gem
We separate the boys from the men
 
[Verse Two] [Blueprint]
I'm far from regular
Crush all competitors
Who, wanna set it off, pull back and let it off
Hard rocks is very soft to touch like terrycloth
Can not scare me at all, stop tryin' to be a boss
Your shit suck by the very definition of it
Another small mind blessed with the biggest budget
They wonder how he does it
Why the people love it
Cause the same philosophy that can move one can move a hundred
It only take one strong thought to move a mountain
A little hope can move people out of project housin'
One wish from a penny put into a fountain
Fuck around and see five fish feedin' five thousand
Been on this path so long that even I can doubt it
Television tellin' me America's Got Talent
But when I look around it, I wonder where they found it
Even the heavyweights didn't have an ounce of it
Sometimes I do think, "What did God do with me?"
So what if they wanna rhyme about cars and jewelry
It ain't about me and them it about you and me
So with or without them I gotta make you believe
Make you see, the beat bang stupidly
Arrange the strings to sync so beautifully 
Escape the lame cliche's by doin' me
Cause any point I wanna make I gotta make musically
 
[Chorus] [Blueprint &amp; Illogic]
They out here playin' with pen
They out here frontin' for they friends
But Greenhouse bring it to an end with this gem
We separate the boys from the men</pre>
