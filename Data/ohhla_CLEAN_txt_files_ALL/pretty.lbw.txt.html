Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
Now we we be chillin we be vibing out
Because I'm famous me and shortie gotta hide out
Kinda new to her but she gonna get used to it
She know no nigga do it like I do it
Lil mama short on the rent well I take care of that
That's just some chump change you ain't gotta pay me back
I've seen alot of women in my life but you the coldest
Test me and pop when I ain't with you cause I want you closer

[Chorus]
Shortie what you need?
Cause baby you can have it all
You wont be needing those baby
Shortie just take it off
My hands on you
Your hands on me
Trying to hold my composure
Of what its gonna be
Hey pretty lady
(da-da-damn girl you're fine)
Hey pretty lady
(I know you hear that all the time)

[Verse 2]
Man shortie so fine
She can have wutever she wants
Tell them other fellas like heinz
They can catch up/ketchup
I'm balling hard contently there ain't nothing like me at all
Those shopping malls we shopping outta designer catalogue
The big pimpin over there baby this is where you wanna be
I do this all year baby ignore the rumors you ain't got nothing to fear baby
Cant listen to your ladies cause they cant keep their man cant they

[Chorus]
Shortie what you need?
Cause baby you can have it all
You wont be needing those baby
Shortie just take it off
My hands on you
Your hands on me
Trying to hold my composure
Of what its gonna be
Hey pretty lady
(da-da-damn girl you're fine)
Hey pretty lady
(I know you hear that all the time)

[Verse 3]
Quit that whenever we chillin
I told my self id never let a woman get my feelings
My homies making fun of me fuck it I know she got me
Plus she said I hit that pussy like nobody
Hot body the illest nigga she ever met
Never miss a flight got my own jet
Which means we can retreat wherever
Snowy or sunny weather
You rolling with the dawg it gets no better

[Chorus]
Shortie what you need?
Cause baby you can have it all
You wont be needing those baby
Shortie just take it off
My hands on you
Your hands on me
Trying to hold my composure
Of what its gonna be
Hey pretty lady
(da-da-damn girl you're fine)
Hey pretty lady
(I know you hear that all the time)</pre>
