see I bee your true choice...Mind mine, as overtime, I got 
the bite when I write - I ignitge....it's like a fight on the mic..i'm 
outasight - take flight - or I'ma catch you off your best turn...then 
proceed to catch wreck just like a tech in a western...Been rockin 
rhymes since the days of Dimples Dee...and we been gettin 
money since the Treacherous Three..not just me...my whole crew
moving 
just like a silver shadow...throwin hammers like Thor 
when we battle...heads rattle...rock and roll...all that jazz, pop and 
soul...what we bring to hip hop be in the form ten fold...When 
rockin the microphone, I play the roll like Karl Malone...on stock 
dun...got dope rhymes for your dome...Visions of Shirley 
Murdock - with my crew, as we lay....I got the 45th cocked - we
got the 
tre's and A.K.'s layed away...as we playin it in luxuries 
lap...Navy Seals is on our ass...I hear we due to get jacked...but
the 
fact, you can't escape..you see we're New York City 
niggas...far from lame - spittin game - even nicer pullin triggas - and 
dig this...they're leaving no witnesses to the bout...so 
me,Joe, L, Rho - we goin all out...As a few play post..another few
get 
roast...Martell for mariwinos - my blood stream the 
host...goin over in my mind - counterattack - I'm on the scheme - 
they've been infiltrated, one of they niggas really on our 
team...Layed it down nights ago..said they was based in V.A.
....They 
supposed to rob before they raid because the way that we 
play, every day, it don't cease...from the streets of no peace...to 
bringin heat to the fleet of crazy crooked police HOOK As 
money's foldin..keep it quiet like you know silence is golden..talkin 
while my teams reloadin...find your mic and mind exploding or 
corrodin...say I show them what it means to flip script..and sink
your 
battleship..slip and cock the clip inside the whip...aimin for 
the right ties...sippin Mai Tai with spiz,trying to school these kids 
that think they learned it all from wise guys...what they 
do..going through a lifetime without a clue...with the need to turn 
around like the cap on my brew...Be askin you when they be 
tellin you your life ain't worth jack...jones for jewels...long to leave 
their name in your back...No riff...the 45th to tounge kiss, for 
what it's worth to fold your ass like a map and leave you huggin the 
earth....knee high - we piled style that you couldn't 
deny...$200. dollar Guess, on the floor, velour Fila...till today..we 
don't play..Never been one to run astray..using my mind like the 
nine as the rhyme leads the way......Born buck..in search of luck..I 
love the feel of sunshine..but sometime when it be raining, still 
you'd see me unwind..one time when I was young and far away
from 
Cancun...Hip Hop was mine to consume...to pass around in 
Stan's room HOOK It's time to load and explode..I'm hittin niggas
like 
they owed..behold...I grab the mic with two hand choke 
holds...I'm out to fold till I'm old..with bank accounts of 
untold..stash cash..plus jars full of slivers of gold...a rhyme 
rocker..I gets 
up in your mouth just like Binaca..with the proper that be bangin
like a 
sock over a locker....Once again Dres..lays it down with 
the slang that bicycle kicks like that nigga Liu Kang...I brang..many
a 
thang in event of battle we..be the baddest ...be turning 
babbles into babalities...on a road to explode..catch me on the
seldom 
walked...from the sands of Sahara to the streets of New 
York..to talk the time of we..even a blind man could see...that he's 
living in the very last of days that be... NYCN pge 2 

Still got the heart of Simba..and the skills of Gepetto...my style is 
quasi moto..ill forms, that rock the ghetto..Whas the deal 
bro...me yo, I been chillin like Sub Zero...not that I'm your
hero...but 
yo, it's hot and full of Nero's ...so me, me and mine in line to 
shine with true clout...Electric...with company...don't make us turn 
your lights out HOOK
