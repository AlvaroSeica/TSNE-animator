Back to X
You nahmsayin' nigga need to pop a pill or suttin'
You nahmsayin' Basedworld Paradise
You know just tryna get back to that place that I know and it feels the best
You nahmsayin, come to Basedworld Paradise you feel me
And just pop this one time, pop this in your headphones
Feel the drug

Back to ecstacy turn you back to ecstacy
Bitch I'm swerving
Shoutout to texas nigga I'm off that lean
You nahmsayin' what it do?
Ah, back to ecstacy turn you back to ecstacy
Yeah, I'm swerving
Shoutout to Port Arthur you nahmsayin
Port Arthur what it do man

AC, Green its hot
Can't see me bitch stop
Boy stop quit playing
Bitch not.. fucking loff
First dude I switch lanes crossover switch fans
I don't play, its money over here
Niggas get popping, niggas gotta win
Wired cars that they hold don't show they face
I was holding that.. it was like 'what's that?'
I'm coming back, You niggas know I'm solid
Get jacked in the streets but I keep it solid
I'm tryna get my shit, tryna come up off a brother with his shit together
Gotta get my mind right overview the world
Cause I don't give a fuck no more
Hittin' niggas with the Glock, leave em stuck in the cut
I was hurt before, I ain't gon let that happen
Again, these niggas get back
Fuck this rapping, Imma show these motherfuckers bout rapping
Show these motherfuckers who get laid up in the casket for rapping
You better learn to rap

Ecstacy I said take me back to ecstacy
I'm swerving
Yeah, I'm swerving its Lil B
Uh, ecstacy take me back to ecstacy
I'm swerving
Its Lil B, Basedworld Paradise mixtape
Collect this, yesss</pre>
