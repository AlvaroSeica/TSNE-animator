[Shug]
Nowadays, a hoe think she so fly
That she can straight whip the pussy on a guy
Shit, get 'em sprung, hung off the hoe's tongue
Throw the whip appeal, cause that shit's fun (aw yeah)
Like to see a nigga cry when they leave
Wanna see you beggin, just pull on her sleeve
Wanna try to break you down, make you feel you need her
In order to get the bitch back you gotta eat her
Make a bitch a promise, offer her a ring
Tell the girl that you would treat her like a queen
But if you're real to the heart and got it clout
Do yourself a favor, and throw the bitch out
And tell her

[Chorus]
We got fuck a bitch fever
Weee, got fuck a bitch fe-ver
We've got fuck a bitch fever
All day long (bitch~!)

[Shug]
Tell a bitch, to straight go to hail
Cause she ate a dick last night and her press-on nail
See girls always wanna pop that shit
But they wanna yell quick when you take a lick
Poppin that jealous role, bitch who you foolin
Nuts still around your mouth, look like you droolin
Yeah I heard about your other man and it hurts me
But your IQ ain't no higher than your skirt be
Hoe had my baby, what was I thankin 'bout
Shoulda known his bitch wasn't no good when I ran him out
That's what I get, for tryin to look for the best
Shit, damn lemme go take this baby to get a blood test

[Chorus] - 2X with ad libs

[Shug]
Now I'm out on the prowl again
Lookin for me just a one night friend
Somethin I can fuck, and not fall in love with
Don't hold hands, and not all that hug shit
Long story short I found the bitch
Now it's time to introduce her to Mr. Dick
Playin that role of bein a nice guy and all that
Knowin damn well I'ma dog her when I get the cat
Since I was good, she said she loved me
Hoe we just met, girl you better jet~!
Just that thought made my stomach real sick
Either you a trick bitch or just a crazy bitch
But fuck it got the pussy free
I ain't a nice guy, all dudes are like me - and

[Chorus] - with ad libs

[Shug]
Damn, you probably think I hate'cha
But I'm a dog, I mean a dude, that's in my nature
Not to give a fat fuck about a bitch
When she dogs me and treats me like shit
See hoes always wanna pop that shit
That a nigga can't hit 'em, fuck that get wit 'em!
Cause I was taught if I get hit, hit back
No matter who the person is Jack
Don't offer that tear in the eye shit
Baby I love you - HOE JUST QUIT~!
The bitch got another nigga on her mind
Cause I hear him on the phone, talkin 'bout he's fine
If he's so damn fine then find that nigga
Hope he make your asshole bigger
But in a month or two hoe you will see
All dudes out there is like me

[Chorus] - 2X with ad libs

[Outro]
Well nowadays you got your pimp hoes
You got your gangster hoes
You got your stank hoes
Unfortunately I had me a stank hoe
And that's why I got me fuck a bitch fever
Right now, today</pre>
