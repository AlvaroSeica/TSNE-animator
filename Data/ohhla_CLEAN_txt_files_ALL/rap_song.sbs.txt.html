[Coach Z - The Cheat voice]
Can I borrow some detergent from you, please?
Say, wait! Look, it's the rapping man, come to do his landry!
I was supposed to ask, can you RECK-erd on my new ablum?
I can understand well that's the yes! Hit it one-two go rap song!

[Coach Z]
Coach Z, R-A-P
Accidentally featuring Peacey P

[Peacey P]
You biscuithead, you ain't featurin' me!

[Coach Z]
I said accidentally featuring Peacey P!
I'm the lyricbolical Coach-Z
I like my ointments topical most-ly
And if you got the itchy toes, then come see me
I got a rap song, featuring Peacey P!

[Peacey P]
My name is P, comma, Peace-ay
I likes to eat my bacon all grease-ay
I'm the best guest rapper in the music biz
I ain't even know whose song this is!

[Coach Z]
It's mine!
I thought I made that abundantly clear!
Here comes the hook!

[Chorus: Coach Z &amp; Peacey P]
R-A-P-S
O-N-G, yes
Yes, y'all, and we don't STAP
Coach Z and Peacey P cold rappity-rap!

[Peacey P]
Much money, mo' money, cash money, drop!

[Coach Z]
I'm the rhyme janitor wringin' out my mop!

[Peacey P]
Stop, fool, you're crampin' my style!

[Coach Z]
I'll sprinkle wack MCs with my sawdust pile!

[Peacey P]
Listen up straight, y'all biscuitheads
I'd like a piece o' dry toast wit' two scrambled eggs!
Order o' hash browns, make 'em extra crisps
A glass o' orange juice an' a bowl o' cheese grits!

[Coach Z]
Oh, dag!
That man has just ordered breakfast in the middle of my rap song!

[Coach Z &amp; Peacey P]
R-A-P-S
O-N-G, yes
Yes, y'all, and we don't flake

[Coach Z]
Here comes Tenerence Love with an R&amp;B break!

[Tenerence Love]
My name is Tenerence Love
Plus my name is Tenerence Love
Divided by my name is Tenerence Love
Equals my name is Tenaaay-erence Love!
Remainder three!

[Chorus]

[Tenerence Love]
Tenerance Love is on a rap song...
... and I'll soon have a rap song

[Coach Z &amp; Peacey P]
R-A-P-S
O-N-G, yes
Yes, y'all, and we don't stap
Coach Z, Peacey P

[Coach Z]
The Chort, that was amazing!
It's gonna rocket straight to the bottom of the BET charts!
Oh, your payment
How's about a nice slice of chin strap pizza?</pre>
