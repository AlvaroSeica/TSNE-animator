{Vampiro}
The lotus pod, the lotus pod fucka
Vampiro, child of the rancid, wrechet, darkness
Vampiro, I truly am a juggalotus
Maniac killa
Super unknown, hero
A true hatchet ryda
Long rain the lotus killas
Then again, its my priviledge
To power bomb your fuckin' ass
On a bed of butcher knife's muthafucka
The result of 6 serial, murderin' maniac killas
Killin', murderin', stabbin' (chopping, hacking, cutting)
All hail the lotus pod from heince we came

{Shaggy 2 Dope}
Hello, Hi I'm Shaggs
I don't know, maybe you heard of me
The Southwest Strangla
That one guy from icp
No?
Well, it's cool then you don't know what to expect
Allow me to extend my hand
In friendship to shake your fuckin' neck
Cause if you don't know, well you don't gotta clue
2dope, maniac killa from dark lotus crew
Oh shit damn, lemme quit chokin' ya Sike, UUhh..uhh...ahhhhahaha

{Monoxide Child}
I need a cigarette before I go bolistic
Statistic of my mind frame
Explains when I'm insane
I'm twiztid branded
With the mark or the axe
A mind relax and all I wanna do is split backs
I'm a maniac
But, you gotta understand that a
I can't control my hands and a
I'll never can choke you if I can and a
Never once
Nowhere in my mind as I was sayin' in a
Ever since I remember, kill is just a game


(x2) I'm a maniac killa, blood gets spilled
See me on the streets bitch, don't get killed
My mind is on my axe and my axe is on my side
Who wanna die?
Who wanna die?

{Violent J}
Uhh..
Watch me, I tippy toe
Richie, your death is slow
Don't run, nowhere to hide
One more, one homicide
Who cares, when I was hungry
Passed out, dead with no money
Mama, she cleaned your toilets
Mama, she bought my bullets
Bullets, can be so pretty
Watch out, ugly and bloody
Fear not, I am no sicko
Your life, not worth the nickle
Don't go, I will not eat you
Your kind, I will defeat you
Mama, never expected
Mama, Her pain corrupted

(x2)
I'm a maniac killa, blood gets spilled
See me on the streets bitch, don't get killed
My mind is on my axe and my axe is on my side
Who wanna die?
Who wanna die?


I'm a maniac killa, blood gets spilled
A maniac killa, don't get killed
I'm a maniac killa, blood gets spilled
A maniac killa, don't get killed

{Jamie Madrox}
I be the maniac K I double L A
I slit their fuckin' throats in half
Sex with all the bodies, I'm a retard
People call me special though
I keep my victims silence
In a melow of a sentalopes
I split you like a cantalope
To see whats on your mind
Smokin' trees, keep me find
But at least smoke to the dime
Till i'm on your front lawn
Waitin' in the cold, the lights on
But don't look like nobody home

{Blaze Ya Dead Homie}
At last I come creepin' to the darkness
Missin' this dark and take out any charges
Dumpin' out my victims
A couple suckas playin' dub with they gases
Nobody else ghetto path
Huh? muthafucka, give up your break
This is blaze ya dead homie sinkin' the head
I've been dead
I thought you knew, I'm a maniac killa
Psycho, thug, feelin' up bags on a daily whut?


(x4)
I'm a maniac killa, blood gets spilled
See me on the streets bitch, don't get killed
My mind is on my axe and my axe is on my side
Who wanna die?
Who wanna die?</pre>
