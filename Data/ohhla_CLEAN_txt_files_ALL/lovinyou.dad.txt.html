Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Dirty Money]
So hard to breathe this air that we call love
Ain't nothin worse than the hurt we receive from love
When you get hurt by the one you livin for
Pain can make you wanna love no more

[Chorus]
Lovin you no more
I just, I can't, I just can't be lovin you no more
I love you more than I love myself; lovin you no more
I just, I can't, I just can't be lovin you no more
I love you more than I love myself

[Diddy]
Hurt with the heart that's bleedin slowly
So many lonely sleepless nights
I'm goin through hell but convinced she loves me
But never her approval no matter how I try
The way you talk to me but still I say I love you
I'm ashamed, you can see it in my eyes
Momma always told me to respect the woman
But what am I to do when her parents do not try?

[Kalenna Harper]
So many tears I've cried
But all for nothin I'm afraid to say
Ohhhh-whoaaaa

[Chorus]

[Diddy]
I've been so dependent on your love for so long
Punishment for me is tryin to let go
Give it from your heart is what you taught me
Addiction to pain is what it got me
My life, now it's changed
My life ain't the same as it was
Heartbroke to the point sometimes wanna end it
if I can't have what mean most to meeeee

[Kalenna Harper]
So many tears I've cried
But all for nothin I'm afraid to say
Ohhhh-whoaaaa

[Chorus]

[Drake]
Diddy! Drizzy baby
Uhh, tryin not to overthink
Only cause I've drove and I done had a lot to drink
When I wanted it blue you said we got to paint it pink
And there's pieces of your hair still sittin in my sink
And you still got underwear that's sittin in the dryer
How come every time that you're suspicious I'm a liar?
You stand out, I can hear you whistle in a choir
And that's the only reason you the missus I admire
Damn~! Tell me what I'm gon' do
Since everything that I'm tryin to forget is all true
Me and all your main girls get along too
I would take my last dollar out and bet it on you
But uhhhh, you see the same one I'm missin
is basically the reason I became somethin different
It's just that I remember me before
And if you could do the same baby then we'd be for sure

[Kalenna Harper]
So selfishly
You can only show feelings
when you feel yours in jeapordy
Oh time, how time has changed
And I'm no longer willin
Cause you see how my heart is bleedin

[Chorus] - 2X</pre>
