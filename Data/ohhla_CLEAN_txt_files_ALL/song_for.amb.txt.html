Typed by: byg_balla@hotmail.com

[Chorus]
People I want you to
Stop toting guns don't shoot
Stop smoking blunts oooh
I've got a song for you

[Verse One]
Sike! didn't think it was a slow jam- did ya?
Didn't think it was an old man- did ya?
I hit ya with scripture listen to every word I say
The rapper Ambassador's back like a vertebrae
Focused vertically, hoping for the day
When biblical sense is more common than courtesy
I envision this hittin' you in the barbershop
Lyrics rushing like wind like when the Spirit of God was dropped
I can see them sisters in the salon
Puttin' The Thesis on with some grease in her palm
Dope tunes boom and they stick in your brain
So when I make a dope tune- BOOM I slip you the name
Jesus Christ- He wants to get in your frame
He owns it but you're like homeless- you need Him to slip you some change
And when he does, Guess what? Life can't stay the same
And when it does, Guess what? Christ can't be the blame

[Chorus]
People I want you to
Stop trading God for loot
Don't leave this life a fool
I've got a song for you

[Verse Two]
Lord, I don't sing but nothing brings more pleasure
Than to offer you to awful dudes who worship that thing called "cheddar"
They've never read of your prophets, gospels, or letters
So, they don't know you're hotter than rockin' four sweaters
But- that's the job of the Ambassador
Hit mics 'cause it's life after the casket door
You know the hood ain't used to them theological truths
Philosophers snooze; they think belief in God is for fools
And I'll admit the existence of God is harder to prove
But please believe that Jesus is God and you're cool
We can work on unpackin' the intricate plan
God understands- like women say about a sensitive man
Much sin's in a man, Through Adam it got into the fam'
Makin' us all prisoners- like when you get sent to the can
And that's trouble- like when Blacks bump into the Klan
But then a infinite hand went and sent us a Lamb

[Bridge]
1, 2 and we you don't stop
And we won't quit
If not for you Lord, we won't spit
We do this for all the hip-hop heads
Spit Christ cause He's life for all the hip-hop dead

[Chorus]
Yea, you see we want to talk to the culture
I mean, why all the killin' and the fightin'
And the fussin' and the drugs
When I've got a song for you?

[Verse Three]
Sike- ahh, the rawness is back
Tell your boys the Lord uses the rawest of raps
The "hard-corest" of tracks cause "hard-coreness" attracts
Some hymns are not a good hook like a chorus that's wack
But He's sovereign he can take from the "boringest" camp
Save a thug with the accordion and a Gregorian chant
That's why even though Hip-Hop is full of ungodliness
God can twist Hip-Hop around- really it's obvious
Got to be gospel, can't say, "Really it's positive"
The rugged cross is the object that we've got to lob to kids
Whether they catch it or not
The method is not the main thing long as the right message is dropped
Why not?  You're actin' like this surprises y'all
The gospel's flex fit; yes it's one size fits all
From the murderer to old lady who prays
To the man that's fit as a fettle or the baby with aids

[Bridge]
1, 2 and we you don't stop
And we won't quit
If not for you Lord, we won't spit
We do this for all the hip-hop heads
Spit Christ cause He's life for all the hip-hop dead

[Chorus]
People I want you to
Hunger and want the truth
If there's no want in you
I've got a song for you

People I want you to
Hunger and want the truth
Don't leave this life a fool
I've got a song for you</pre>
