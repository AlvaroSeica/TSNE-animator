[Intro: Layzie]
Yeah, little Layzie Bone, WC (Dub, Dub-C!)
Puttin it down from Northside Connects to the Westside (yeah)
[WC] What's crackin ni'a?
Runnin shit for the 2000 (let's do this, yeah)
 
[Chorus 2X: Layzie Bone] {+ ad libs}
We creep creep creep and we crawl crawl crawl
Ballin on all of y'all
Niggaz heavy in the gaaaame
And we connectin the plots, and we connectin the plots
 
[WC]
Move back homie - as I pump my Chevy up, mash and hit the gas
Fly my bandana up outta the window and left her ass on the smash
Maniac mission, dippin, screw-job intermission
You're bangin for mine from the West to the East to the 9-9
Bow down bustas ain't no bannin me
Now I'm back, and I'ma walk on with Layzie and the Mo Thug Family
Dub-C, C-Dub rippin, trippin, click-click
I loaded the clip in with my eighty gauge twistin
Got you bitch niggaz ticked and move and walk up outta the kitchen
Connect Gang and Mo Thugs, some real nigga collision
Rollin 'til the wheels fall off, pullin my penis
Throwin up the dub so much that I got atheritis in my fingers (Westside!)
Ride and rhyme, and get her high with illegal thai so
Peep this bread, y'all niggaz don't want no parts of the "Ghetto Heisman"
With them thangs in the dash, nigga we bang for the cash
Steadily aimin for that ass, burnin them thangs when I blast nigga!
 
[Chorus]
 
[Layzie Bone]
Give me some room Dub
I'm fin' to swang on these niggaz!
 
You see the connection when I be flexin
nigga better move in the other direction
Choose your weapon and make a selection
cause nigga we runnin you outta your section
Ain't no question, who it be, little Layzie Bone and Dub-C
Nigga we ride with the gangsta gangsta niggaz, Cube and Eazy-E, E
Better pump your fist and throw them dubs 'til they reach the sky
Puttin it down 'til the day I die, you know I take a eye for a eye
Smokin a lot to keep my mind steady, you niggaz ain't ready
for what I be bringin and ain't none of my crimes petty
So nigga don't test me
On the Westside I rides, in a lo-lo dippin them corners
From the double-glock to Watts, this shit don't stop in Killafornia
Nigga I'm a - world wide baller call me the international Thug
Makin it happen so nigga now what? Nigga you know this nothin but love
But this - game that we play in it's money, murder and mayhem
We got rules and we gotta obey them, got dues and we gots to pay them
Say them - niggaz up the block, disrespectin your spot
Hit 'em up with a tec and glock cause nigga we connectin the plots
 
[Chorus]
 
[WC]
Callin on them bangers, I'm gonna creep through all you haters
No matter what you're thinkin, me and Layzie runnin the game
and off the chain and swangin, I come ready to blast
Clickin my pumps, smackin New Jack's ass
Clippin doin leanest, my lo-lo's the cleanest
There's no Cristal, just to toss canibal be legit to brain and
I's jaded, the most hated, I can't be faded
Dub-C and Layzie Bone the greatest, ni'a!
 
[Layzie Bone]
Burna and Dub you see ain't none of you fake niggaz gon' trouble me
You catch me in this century, gettin blew back off that bubbly
We them, street motherfuckers who got some, big motherfuckers
Playin for keeps motherfuckers, bringin the heat to you motherfuckers
Breakin y'all, team motherfuckers every time we speak to y'all cowards
Wettin you niggaz down like showers, competition get devoured
Sendin flowers to your momma, bringin the drama be the shit
Bringin that Thuggsta Thuggsta Thuggsta Thuggsta gangsta shit
 
[Chorus]
 
[Layzie Bone] + (WC)
Tell 'em how it is big bruh
We ain't holdin shit back ("Thug By Nature", L-Burn)
That's right (Dub-C the Ghetto Heisman)
I'm rollin with the Ghetto Heisman, y'all niggaz ain't ready for this
 
[Chorus]
 
[Outro: Layzie] + (WC)
(L-Burn y'all) Shut these niggaz down every time
Y'all can't FUCK with my big brother Dub-C bitch!
(L-Burn y'all, L-Burn y'all, "Thug By Nature")
Uh-huh (y'all know what time it is)
Yeah, nigga, ha</pre>
