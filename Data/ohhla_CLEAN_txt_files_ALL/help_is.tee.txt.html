[Intro: T.I.]
Help on the way, help on the way
You say the game in trouble help on the way (fret not I tell you)
Ay, ay, help on the way
Ay, ay, help on the way (I got this shit)
Ay, ay, help on the way
You say the game in trouble help on the way (what you worried for?)
Ay, ay, help on the way, hey (have I ever let you down befo'?)
Ay, ay, ay, ay (ha ha ha)
I got the game on lock, standin on top
Say hello to the man who can save hip-hop (hey)
Hey, hey, hey, hey (say hello to the guy)
Say hello to the man who can save hip-hop
Hey, hey, hey, hey (who single-handedly gon' save hip-hop, ha ha)
Say hello to the man who can save hip-hop {Just Blaze!}
 
[T.I.]
They say the game fucked up and the records ain't sellin
It was bad in '06, gettin worse in '07
Market over-saturated with all the bootleggin
When it seems better shawty ain't no tellin
Well call Lyor, give him this message
Then hit Kys', tell him tell Kevin
Craig, Julie Greenwald, all of them present
That 50 mil' you gave me was a sound investment
This time around we gon' sell five, no less than
four on a slow day, call Vegas and bet this
By the way, if you a winner I'm the one you should bet with
J, tell them we the wrong niggaz to bet 'ganist
Grand Hustle homie I'ma make you respect this
They say the market share's down so I ain't affected
Tell the label relax and ain't no need to stress shit
Just cut the check and I'll handle the rest, shit
 
[Chorus: T.I.]
You say the game in trouble help on the way
Don't worry 'bout nuttin, help on the way
You say the game in trouble help on the way
I got this shit, help on the way
You say the game in trouble help on the way
Don't worry 'bout nuttin, help on the way
You say the game in trouble help on the way
I got this shit, help on the way
I got the game on lock, standin on top
Say hello to the man who can save hip-hop
I got the game on lock, it ain't gon' stop
Say hello to the man who can save hip-hop
I got the game on lock, standin on top
Say hello to the man who can save hip-hop
I got the game on lock, it ain't gon' stop
Say hello to the man who can save hip-hop
 
[T.I.]
You hear my name so hot, I got the game on lock
You niggaz keep floppin, I remain on top
Still the same ol' me with the same ol' glock
From the first CD with my Kangol top
I would holla "Dope Boy" when I first came out
It seems like e'rybody in the dope game now
Man I told these niggaz that it ain't gon' stop
All the hatin gon' stop or this thang go BAP
Most of these niggaz ain't slang no blocks
Got a lil' somethin but it ain't so hot
Try to sell a record when my shit drop
Get the cover of a magazine when my shit out
No I think not, just think why
would they pick you over I when you ain't this fly
Better watch yo' mouth, boy you ain't that high
The King of the South, no you ain't that guy
 
[Chorus] w/ ad libs
 
[T.I.]
To the fans and the critics think hip-hop missin
This a lil' proof that hip-hop livin
You can hear a hip-hop top now just listen
Now see hip-hop walk out with six bitches
In the ATL see hip-hop chillin
in a multi-million dollar crib hip-hop buildin
You know how many different cars hip-hop's driven?
Nigga I'm e'rything hip-hop's missin
Nigga you is e'rything hip-hop isn't
My heart and my soul where hip-hop livin
To anyone whoever said hip-hop finished
It can't be dead while I'm still in it
I'm livin it
 
And well might I add at that
Ay homie, the real is
This shit is very much alive baby
 
[Chorus] w/ ad libs
 
[Outro: T.I.]
Yeah man, record sales
Huh, forget about it, I do this shit in my sleep man
They say bootlegging's up, sho' nuff?
I don't notice, ha ha ha ha
Every album I drop I get better and better man, y'knowmsayin?
Check my résumé, this is no motherfuckin exception
If history serves us correctly
Fuck the climate nigga, I turn the heat up when I want to
Legend tells it... yeahhhhhh
Okay, okay, ay Just
Gather round I'll run it down people (we did it again baby!)
This how it's gon' play out, down to the wire baby
It's gon' be a photo finish (I don't know what you expected there)
Just little ol' me man, ha ha ha
If you don't like it man you better get your pistol ready man
Time to kill yourself right about now</pre>
