See, this what we gonna do y'all
We cappin 2 double 0 2 y'all
R Kelly got caught whylin
He sold more sex videos then he did albums
A lot of y'all went down, fam
Yall did some dumb stuff for SoundScan
The industry did Micheal Jackson greasy
Brandy wasnt sellin so she put her pregnancy on TV
Cash Money refused to flock
Baby said F it, I'm takin Juvenile spot
Christina Ag, she turned into a slut-piece
For her record to sell, she let out all of her buttcheeks
Rap girls, take a lesson from that
Cuz no one remembers the girl that made "My Neck, My Back"
And Hip-Hop was at it again
Suge came home, and Slick Rick went back in
Man y'all took it to the streets again
But this year, a lot of y'all caught beef again
JD and Dre starting off dissin
Then they stopped when they figured out nobody was listenin
Then the IRS hauled Jd's cash off
Dre probaly in Cali now laughin his ass off
By now don't nothing amaze me
In the middle of the summer, man Nas went crazy
He was like, "I got power. Hot ain't gotta play me"
"All y'all wack, and yes I was gonna lynch Jay-Z"
I guess he figured y'all ain't gonna punk me
Admitted to payolla and put Flex on Front Street
And Flex almost got banned
When he saw Steph Lova, he tried to speak with his hand
And Steph thugged it, like I ain't bout to get played
She drove straight to the precinct like I'm bout to get paid
P. Diddy kept cruisin
You wouldnt think half the year he didnt even have distrubution
Yall can front like I don't care
But this year, got damn man, Diddy was everywhere
And designer's made doe
But we got Bur-Burberry, we can't wear that no mo'
And jersey's is next on the list
Yall was wearing throwbacks of players that don't even exist
Shout out to the Clipse, they kept it on time
The hardest record of the year, that would have to be Grindin
Em became the Elvis of rappin
Justin tried to do it with black music, EHH! Didnt happen!
Man this year was a trip
J-Lo and Ben will be over by the time y'all hear this
War time, Bush wanting actions
But we was too busy worried about what Missy was saying backwards
Snoop stopped smokin Indo
Mike Jackson put his baby out the window
Hot with the Escalade, I know y'all want one
To get back at the industry, the award goes to Cam'Ron
"Oh Boy" was huge, G
Dame gave him the VP, and forgot to tell Jay-Z
You know whats more wild
I watched 3LW grow up and turn into Destiny's Child
And that wasnt expected
Them broads lost one member, and couldnt sell one record
Scarface made a classic
Mike Tyson got his ass kicked
A lot of rappers kept faking
Beyonce did a lot of dating
Kelly rushed a album of a joint with Nelly
And got the same results Hype got when he made Belly
She still look hot half the time
Funniest video of the year, that would have to be mine
Production, my mans and dem got down
That would be the Neptunes, they got that hands down
By the rules you gotta play
And I swear that BET got stock in B2K
But thats another conversation
And Tweet know damn well that "Oops" was about masturbation
"Best Of Both Worlds" was sloppy
But damn it still sold a million copies
If I was home, I would of told R its ok to cut
But do you know how much tour money that you just messed up
And this year was still gutter
And 50, 50 came back like a muthafucker
Still beefin with Ja and Gotti
They could of chose Johnny, Ricky, or Ralph; man why they choose Bobby
Whats left to say
RIP to Left Eye Lopez, and Jam Master Jay
And thats it from me
Skillz; I'll see y'all in 2 double 0 3</pre>
