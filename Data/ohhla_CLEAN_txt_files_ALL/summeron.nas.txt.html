[Intro: Miguel]
Bad bitches, champagne wishes
Freaks only baby let me take pictures

[Nas] (Miguel):
Life is good! Life is good! 
(Life is good! Life is good!) Life is good!
(Life is good! Li-Life is good!) Swizzy!

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz] (*Miguel)
Ciroc on splash (Splash) Summer on smash (Smash)
Top all gone got the summer on smash
Tank top on (On) Summer on smash
My neck got a whole lotta glass
Got the summer on smash, summer on smash
Y'all know who got the summer on smash (We do!)
Look at baby girl, showin that ass
Should let the world know that summer on smash
Got the summer on smash, summer on smash (*Life is good! Life is good!)
Everybody get the summer on smash (*Life is good! Li-Life is good!)
We got the summer on smash (Smash) Summer on smash (Smash)
Y'all know who got the summer on smash (*Life is good!) (We do!)

[Verse One: Nas]
We got the summer on smash, eighteen cats
Lil' overweight hit the gym let's go get the abs
And, Louis belt hangs on the waist it ain't fasten
I'm tryin to get every number from every woman passin me by
She's fly, black asian boriqua
Italian mixed chicks middle eastern, arichian
Ethiopian how ya openin
Just roll forward I'm 'bout to smoke again
Rose gold rollie ridin the top down
Hottest pools and bathin suits on the yachts now 
Send a massive email to the females
Tell 'em where to meet us give 'em the details

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz] (*Miguel)
Ciroc on splash (Splash) Summer on smash (Smash)
Top all gone got the summer on smash
Tank top on (On) Summer on smash
My neck got a whole lotta glass
Got the summer on smash, summer on smash
Y'all know who got the summer on smash (We do!)
Look at baby girl, showin that ass
Should let the world know that summer on smash
Got the summer on smash, summer on smash (*Life is good! Life is good!)
Everybody get the summer on smash (*Life is good! Li-Life is good!)
We got the summer on smash (Smash) Summer on smash (Smash)
Y'all know who got the summer on smash (*Life is good!) (We do!)

[Verse Two: Nas]
The jam here check it, this is summertime
Women damn near naked, it's single season they chosin who to mess with
I just smashed another belt for the record, respect it
Nas get you out your seats, play this in your jeeps
My people in the streets I make you feel like It's the beat
My goons close by darin one of y'all to reach
I'm protected like the President ain't gotta give a speech 
Got a compus on the wrist, Illmatic on the seats
And they ain't even out yet she like Ciroc peach
Chain smoke cigars count a whole 'lot of cash
And y'all already know who got the summer on smash

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz] (*Miguel)
Ciroc on splash (Splash) Summer on smash (Smash)
Top all gone got the summer on smash
Tank top on (On) Summer on smash
My neck got a whole lotta glass
Got the summer on smash, summer on smash
Y'all know who got the summer on smash (We do!)
Look at baby girl, showin that ass
Should let the world know that summer on smash
Got the summer on smash, summer on smash (*Life is good! Life is good!)
Everybody get the summer on smash (*Life is good! Li-Life is good!)
We got the summer on smash (Smash) Summer on smash (Smash)
Y'all know who got the summer on smash (*I gotta do somethin kinda unepected huh?) (We do!)

[Bridge: Miguel]
Bad bitches, champagne wishes
Freaks only baby let me take pictures
Skin....sin, wait do you know who's pool your in (What!)
Beaches in Brazil (What!) Steaks on the grill (What!)
Your body is a weapon that you can't conceal 
Real big money when the freaks come 
Summer on mars it's totally +Total Recall+
Like oooh la vita she wanna flyyyy!!! Caliente!!
Mami vente vente call me we gone!!!! Why yooooooooooooooo!!!!

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz] (*Miguel)
Ciroc on splash (Splash) Summer on smash (Smash)
Top all gone got the summer on smash
Tank top on (On) Summer on smash
My neck got a whole lotta glass
Got the summer on smash, summer on smash
Y'all know who got the summer on smash (We do!)
Look at baby girl, showin that ass
Should let the world know that summer on smash
Got the summer on smash, summer on smash (*Life is good! Life is good!)
Everybody get the summer on smash (*Life is good! Li-Life is good!)
We got the summer on smash (Smash) Summer on smash (Smash)
Y'all know who got the summer on smash (*Life is good!) (We do!)

[Outro: Miguel]
