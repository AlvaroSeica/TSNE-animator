[Hook]
I know your man, ain't loving you right
You lonely and depressed, you need a thug in your life
He do you real bad, and he be hulling you right
So come with me, and you could get some good loving tonight baby

[Kyleon]
Hey boo, I got a one night plan
How bout me and you, go and do a one night stand
It's two o'clock in the morning, and the club closing
Let's hit the valet, so we can get the dubs rolling
We can get up on a room, or we can head to my spot
I don't want much, I just want some head and some cot
And we can roll up some weed, and we can both get high
And turn this night, into the 4th of July
Let's get wild baby, me and you switching positions
From the flo' bathtub, bedroom to the kitchen
Or in the car baby, you giving me top in the drop
So what you waiting on boo, just hop in the drop
Give me a few minutes, to spit this macking
I can have this girl in no time, so let's get this cracking
I know your man, ain't loving you right
You lonely and depressed, you need a thug in your life that's what ya need baby

[Hook]

[Kyleon]
I'm not Cee-Lo Green, but you the one girl
You got me fired up, now look what you done done girl
Let's go somewhere where we can chill, and have some fun girl
(but I got a man) I got a gal, so you can be my fun girl
I know your man, can't do it like me
And his heart don't pump, them fluids like me
Fuck with me baby, and I'll make sure you done right
And I don't need a lifetime, all I need is one night
And we could do this, on a regular basis
But somewhere special, not just them regular places
Hey boo I appreciate ya, I'm not finna treat ya like a hoe
This just our little secret, and we can keep this on the low
Cause our business, is not your bidness
You tell somebody, baby girl that's your bidness
I know your man, ain't loving you right
You lonely and depressed, you need a thug in your life that's what ya need baby

[Hook - 2x]
