Song:   I'd Like a Man
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I can do it like no one can
I'd like a man
Mary had a little lamb but
I'd like a man
Really, I just don't understand
I'd like a man
Not a ho but I'll hold your hand
I'd like a man

It's been quite a long time I've been on top of course
And yes, quite a few has been on top of these verse
My mom suggest herself how tax max, her new friends who know best
Under duress, even though obvious
We'll be from France, we'll be from Bermuda
Doesn't smoke gudda, he is like Bermuda
But necessarily, with the giant belly
He sings my melody, goes to therapy if necessary
I'm looking everywhere for this dude
This is not turning out so cool
Fuck chemistry, is it you? Is it you?
Wait, I just stepped in dog poo

I don't need much to fall in love with you
Don't need a man with a BMW
I just want a champion curler
Mile deeper but so much percular

We could go to Panama out adventuring
And just your arms around me while we watch a documentary
He's my time stand of the century, has empathy
While my dress is part of me cuz it fits and it's curly
Be politely opens doors, and my mind is literally
Four steps ahead of me like I'm a centipede, center please
Wanna call the queen, now this you little can
If you know what that means thenâ¦ you know me
I'm kinda freaky care to eatin or drinkin
Time of it kickin, I'm super deep thinkin
Big eyes, big heart, just like Jesus
Makes me feel down below like what the bass does in my sneakers

I don't need much to fall in love with you
Don't need a man with a BMW
I just want a champion curler
Mile deeper but so much percular

I don't need much to fall in love with you
Don't need a man with a BMW
I just want a champion curler
Mile deeper but so much percular

I'd like aâ¦ I'd like aâ¦
I'd like a man
Hey hey hey
I'd like aâ¦ I'd like aâ¦
I'd like a man
Hey hey hey
I'd like aâ¦ I'd like aâ¦
I'd like a man
Hey hey hey
I'd like aâ¦ I'd like aâ¦
I'd like a man

While I ask my teacher to see what was up
He said ego's in the way of what the true self wants
If you don't gotta show, may gotta clean up your soul
Yea, I mean I'm doing that, that's how I roll
I don't need a man, I gotta focus on me
Be the best me, then I'll find me, that's cute
To get the relationship of my parents
Shout to mom and dad, still make out after 30 years of marriage

I don't need much to fall in love with you
Don't need a man with a BMW
I just want a champion curler
Mile deeper but so much percular

I don't need much to fall in love with you
Don't need a man with a BMW
I just want a champion curler
Mile deeper but so much percular

I'd like a man
Hey hey hey
I'd like a man
Hey hey hey
I'm in heaven
Hey hey hey
With my boy
I'd like a man
Where is your boy girl?
Where is that confounded man?</pre>
