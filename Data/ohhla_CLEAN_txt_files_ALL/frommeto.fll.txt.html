[Masta Killa sample]
This is a gathering of the masses
That come and pay respect to the Wu-Tang Clan

[Dr. Ama]
Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang
Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Suuuuuuu
Return of the Dragon, Shaolin killer style
Fatigue pants sagging, Breaking backs like Chinese Hercules
Enemies fearing these vocal slugs that's slow from impact loaded with
Mercury
The killer, Slang spiller like blood on the murder scene
Had to gain knowledge of self so every word'll gleam
Verbal team consist of the Wu-Tang swordsmen
The Lords in this mental chess game the rest estain pain
Vision blurry, To peace you with my fists of fury
Surely, Perverted Monk purely to Judge and Jury
We roll, Let's have a duel of the iron fist
I pitty the fool, As Wu combine hits with flying kicks
The Iron Maiden got the vital signs fading fast
The Street Fighter, Technique is trash, You can't last
S.I. be the deadly Avengers
Dipped in black, To attack in the night like a ninja
We enter, Severally bruised, Manchuz surrender
With no clues of how Wu's techniques dismember
Your last breath cause this game of death is breath-taking
Chinese connection got your whole opposing section shaking
First you was bragging, Now the Clan got ya jagging
Your like the price you pay when you Enter the Dragon

[Various Wu-Tang samples]
My clan is thick like plaster, Bust ya, Slash ya
Never teach the Wu-Tang
I bomb atomically, Socrates' philosophies and hypothesis
Can't define how I be dropping these
Are you a warrior, Killer, Slicing shit like a Samurai
Yo, Yo fuck that, Look at all these crab niggas laid back
The Meth will come out, Tomorrow
Styles get busy, Bizarre, Bizarro
Ohh, What, Grab my nut get screwed
Oww, Here comes my Shaolin style
Champion gear that I rock and get your boots knocked
Then attack you like a pit then lock shit down
There's no place to hide once I step inside the room
Dr. Doom, Prepare for the boom
Vocabulary Donna talking, Tell your story walking
Wu-Tang Clan aint nothing to fuck with...</pre>
