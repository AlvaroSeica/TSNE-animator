Song:   Raised in the Slumz
Typed by: no1wammy@hotmail.com

Hook: Psalmz
We left the hood, but the hood's still in us
We left some niggas, but the real stood with us
Through the lows, through the highs, through the rigors
Real recognize real
Ay yo, this is for my niggas

(Verse 1)
[Psalmz]
I'm losin' my grip
My life slippin' away
Does the Lord hear wicked men pray, especially me
Am I no more than just an inch from the grave, restin' in peace
You know how low I sink to get paid, ask the police
My life's flawed, let me think of the ways
Livin' in sin, I beginnin' to think
This isn't a phase
And I'm gettin' afraid
Life's passin' me by
For I'm livin'
I find myself askin' to die

[IzReal]
The corners were classrooms, school was the slums
Knew fools by the choice of words, used by they tongue
Slugs run like greyhounds, howl barrels and guns
Cause death is a trademark, and you go as you come
Tears of blood in the same size, souls paint skies
Niggas fall like flies way before the mural dries
Survivin' is easy when expectin' to die
That's life in a rear mirror
Passin' us by

Chorus: Ark
We were raised in the slums
Raised as I strays by the blaze of the gun
But the brave never run
And the way we become
But don't blame us
Blame the ways where we from

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 2)
[Ark]
In the east, you see the worst happen, from purse snatchin'
Everyday, a new person in the hearse passin'
I seen it all first caption, live and unedited
No truce, tooth for tooth is how we settled it
The kettle is hot, it's blisterin', blocks we livin' in
Listenin'
Night and day to shots whistlin'
You find out, you in too deep to climb out
I'm takin' the world with me when it's time to sign out

[Psalmz]
In the Amazon
We got a gladiator fabrics on
And on the ave, it's on
Beware of sabotage
Anacondas, snakes, jakes drivin' by an Avalon
Mom's are on Medica, Section 8, cause dad's are gone
BK, NY
Won't leave til I die
So I seen men die, cry, fiend to get high
Even a lie around here's a reason to die
We reach for the sky, but settle for a piece of the pie

Repeat Chorus

Repeat Hook Twice

(Verse 3)
[IzReal]
This is half the story, imagine a full dose
Of slippin' through the arms of death
Steadily
Dodgin' bullet shots, skin are too close
Wipe footprints
So death can't trace my steps
My brother's a memory, and they chippin' away, under the stairs
I pray, but they goin' in pairs
Only see the one
I look the kids in my face, I hang by my faith
I know my Lord's knee deep in my prayers, please forgive me

[Ark]
I'm from the slum where the guns at it
Mad a day, we love static
Some'll panic and run franic
Cause some have it and some don't, so act fast
Any breath can be your last gasp
When you least know it, I keep forward
Leading the blind
Seek and you find, I'm a street poet, freein' my mind
Speak in the untold, cold like the grudge of the gun holds
Waitin' to unload when adversity unfolds

Repeat Chorus Twice
