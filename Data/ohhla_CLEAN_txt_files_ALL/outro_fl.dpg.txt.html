[Chorus: Daz Dillinger]
It feels good to be a motherfuckin' gangsta
It feels good to be a Dogg Pound Gangsta
It feels good to be a motherfuckin' gangsta
(the D-O double-G, the P-O-U-N-D)
It feels good to be a Dogg Pound Gangsta
It feels good to be a motherfuckin' gangsta
It feels good to be a Dogg Pound Gangsta
(the D-O double-G, the P-O-U-N-D)

[Kurupt]
Hit me nigga, cut throat nigga
We ride and quote niggaz, soak niggaz
Royaly wrote, indica smoke niggaz
Get lifted high like glass and coke nigga
I'm Gotti, I don't fuck with no hooks
I make pelicans fly, I make the AR-fif' cook
This "The Shining" nigga, honey I'm home
I came with two friends, nine and chrome
Nigga it's just like this, I'll break your wrist
Push shit through your hip that'll twist and dent
Shift and split and then go back where I went
Wanna know where I went, nigga follow the fifth
The only two buddies I need, the hollow and fifth
I'll have you swallow the hollow and live
Fall quickly after the chip
And all that's left is tremblin' and ligament restricted
Nigga ride

[Chorus: Daz Dillinger]
It feels good to be a motherfuckin' gangsta
It feels good to be a Dogg Pound Gangsta
It feels good to be a motherfuckin' gangsta
(the D-O double-G, the P-O-U-N-D)
It feels good to be a Dogg Pound Gangsta
It feels good to be a motherfuckin' gangsta
It feels good to be a Dogg Pound Gangsta
(the D-O double-G, the P-O-U-N-D)

[Daz Dillinger]
I come back with that AK fully automatic
Lettin' niggaz have it, so who the fuck want static?
It's spazmatic, catchin' they breath, they could get paniced
Surrounded by choppers and G niggaz with big cannons
Peel them niggaz like bananas in an all blue bandana
(Dumpin' with K's, goin' bananas with bananas and the hammers, then we - )
Swoopin' down the block, rims spinnin' but my beat still knock
Nigga Daz don't stop, my heat stay cocked and ready
My vendetta's a nine baretta, puttin' blood holes in your sweater
In due time I can only get better, see I won't fall off
I bounce back like hard or soft
Your whole crew get tossed, you lost a few, left critically injured
Next time y'all fake niggaz will remember
Uh, Dat Nigga Daz is a G 'bout this
We fuck shit up and now we out this bitch

[Chorus: Daz Dillinger]
It feels good to be a motherfuckin' gangsta
It feels good to be a Dogg Pound Gangsta
It feels good to be a motherfuckin' gangsta
(the D-O double-G, the P-O-U-N-D)
It feels good to be a Dogg Pound Gangsta
It feels good to be a motherfuckin' gangsta
It feels good to be a Dogg Pound Gangsta
(the D-O double-G, the P-O-U-N-D)
