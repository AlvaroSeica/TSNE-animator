[R. Kelly]
Everyday and night I pray
Love will swing you back this way
Life without you here with me
Ain't the same without you G 

Baby, hear me, I never meant to hurt you
Baby come and talk to me
Let me know what's on your mind
Everytime I see you
You're running from me all the time 

Baby, hear me, I never meant to hurt you
I only wanted you..

[Chorus]
You to be, be happy
You to have the best of things
You to be, down with me, baby
'Cause your lovin' is so good 

Giving me the run-around
Thought our love was going down
Baby don't you know that I'm down until the day I die

Baby, hear me, never meant to hurt you
Girl, you know I'd never do anyhthing to hurt you
'Cause baby I love you
Every night and day I pray your love returns
Oh I'd give my life if it would only make you happy 

[B.I.G.]
Sitting, reminiscing on when you started dissing
Spitting in faces in public places
Rolex with wood faces had you chipper for months
Made some dough, did some shows, now you're starting to front
Smoking blunts on the verandah with Amanda
She's filling your head with, "he said, she said"
Poppa doing this, Poppa doing that
But don't tell him I said it, 'cause my Jeep might get wetted
Forget it, go on take her work like the Koran
Ya'll stay friends, I stay in smoke filled Benzes
I regret putting you on to biggouts
Honeysuckle six, Biggie secret pajama sets
You was a Reebok vandal, now you wear Chanel sandals
I made you, why would I play you?
Think about it while in the streets you roam
It's Dom P's and Cristies in the fridge when you get home 

[Chorus]

[R. Kelly]
Everyday and night I pray
Love will swing you back this way
Life without you here with me
Ain't the same without you G
