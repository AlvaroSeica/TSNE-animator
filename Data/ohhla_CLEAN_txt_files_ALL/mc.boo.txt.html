[ Vex ]
One time for the minds out there
Cypher verbal combat's got striker contact
To the head of the listener - I'm back
Elemental states of metamorphosis thought process drop
Mental blessed without recess, no stress
Come into my realm, snow desert and you wonder how sun is ice
Cool enough to bring the heat, I'm nice
Oblique as ice when I splice sound
I was born in the Northland, Alaska eatin rice
Whoa, lyrical dexterity like Bruce Lee
I create my own technique of speak, interceptin verbs sound superb
Phenomenal, touching every point and star in the sky
Astronimical, see in me the comical ( ? ) like gas in a bottle
Full throttle with a flame at the top
Everlasting light is the bomb when we drop
So give a ( ? ) the props
Mechanize divine inspiration through physical manifestation

Mental Calisthenics

[ Vex ]
I'm the walking black hole - sun
Generatin gravitational pull - from
Suspended animation I'm full, some
You're posin in the midst of the chosen - one
Golden child as I compile - sum
Of holy mathematics in my attic - none
Can contest the champion sound - done
Finished and final, I'm alive on arrival 
Let the gates of Heavens change us
Strangers to the world's danger
Flash out your lighter, only turn on flamers
Fire - represent Christ, Almighty Sire
Take em higher, in my presence evil demons expire
Away to the dephts of hell
Workers of inequity as I sport Goretex and Timberland
Vortex, I'm vexed like God's wrath upon this evil nation
Feel the God Sound vibration

War

Mental Calisthenics

We doin Mental Calisthenics

Cause to me M.C. means Mental Calisthenics
Tri-State
Heads ain't ready
It's Armagheddon
You best to exercise your mind</pre>
