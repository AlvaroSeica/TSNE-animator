[Intro]
My goodies, my goodies, my goodies, not my goodies

[Petey Pablo]
I got a sick reputation for handlin' broads
All I need is me a few seconds or more (Few seconds or more!)
And it's a rap
Tell the lady to bring my 'llac
And I ain't comin' back so you can put a car right there
I'm the truth, and I ain't got nothin' to prove
You can ask anybody cause they seen me do it
Barricades? I run right through 'em
Use to em, throw all the dirt you want (it don't amuse me)
Still gon' have a pin-up in a fabulous room
Bone her back, pickin' out a basket of fruit
I love you boo! Yeah, freaky petey love you too
Haha, you know how I do

[Ciara]
You may look at me and think that I'm, just a young girl
But I'm not, just a young girl baby this is what I'm lookin' for
Sexy, independent, down to spend for types you get in the store
I'm not bein to dramatic, that's the way I gotta have it

[Chorus]
I bet you want the goodies
Bet you thought about it
Got you all hot and bothered
Because I talk about it

If you're lookin' for the goodies
Keep on lookin' cause they stay in the jar
Oh, Oh, Oh, Uh-oh

[Ciara]
Just because you drive a benz
I'm not goin' home with you
You wont get no nookie, or the cookies I'm no rookie
If you ain't sexy, independent, I ain't wit it
So you already know, I'm not being to dramatic
That's the way I gotta have it
No need to slick, try to hit, but im not
I'm not bein to dramatic, it's just how I gotta have it

[Chorus]
I bet you want the goodies
Bet you thought about it
Got you all hot and bothered
It's making ya talk about it
If you're lookin' for my goodies
Keep on lookin' cause they stay in the jar
Oh, Oh, Oh, Uh-oh

[Petey Pablo]
So damn hot but so young (so young!)
You still got milk on ya tounge
Slow down little one
You ain't got it all
Hey shawty, your ol' pretty body
You think you bad? But you ain't bad
I'll show you what bad is (I'm bad)
Bad is when you're capable of beatin' the baddest (I'm bad)
I've been workin' at it ever since I came to this planet
I ain't quite did yet, but I'm gettin' better at it
Matter of fact, let me tell it to you one mo-ghen
All I got to do is tell the girl who I am
Ain't nah-chick in here that I can't have
Badaboom, badabam, babam

[Ciara]
Your insinuating that I'm hot
But these goodies boy are not
Just for any other mini-man who's tryin' to get on top
No you can't call me later
And I don't want your number
I'm not changing stories
Just respect the player callin'

[Chorus] x2
I bet you want the goodies
Bet you thought about it
Got you all hot and bothered
It's making ya talk about it
If you're lookin' for my goodies
Keep on lookin' cause they stay in the jar
Oh, Oh, Oh, Uh-oh</pre>
