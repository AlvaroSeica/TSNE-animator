Hey yo Sean, you Mr. Kingston

[Chorus 1 - Sean Kingston]
Dutty dutty dutty love
I'm feeling like you're letting go
Dutty dutty dutty love
I'm feeling like you're letting go
Dutty dutty dutty love
I'm feeling like you're letting go
Dutty dutty dutty love

[Sean Kingston]
Don't be scared girl, call on me
'Cuz me ah want you for my eyes I'm a lover, you see
And the way you ah whine and the way you ah gwan
Say de man dem ah try fi rush ya, like dem prey non-stop
But baby girl will you be mine
Let go, show your skin because you're one of a kind
Me nah go lie, girl I must be in love
'Cuz the way you ah whine you have me caught up

[Chorus 2 - Sean Kingston]
Dutty dutty dutty love
I'm feeling like you're letting go
Dutty dutty dutty love
I'm feeling like you're letting go
Dutty dutty dutty love
I'm feeling like you're letting go
Dutty dutty dutty love

What if you would just come right out of these clothes
You can finally feel the wind when it blows
Don't be scared to be free to let go, show it off
Feel like letting go
Oh oh oh oh

[Sean Kingston]
I'm hearing your man not right
'Cuz you need Sean King inna your life, gyal
King ah mi name and mi name can't change
And if I come over there I'll let go with them lips
Yo, I feel like letting go
If you never know, baby now you know
'Cuz you're one of a kind, and you dress so fine
Like my diamond on my chain, you shine so bright now.

[Chorus 2]

[Nicki Minaj]
Hey yo Sean, you Mr. Kingston
You say you have it, Louis it, and then some
Look how you gwan in ah your ice
You pretty and you nice
You done know say Nicki ah your wife
But true say I be up where you stay
I aint like them other bitches that be actin' loosely
Know you gettin' hype, I know you wanna get up in it
But I just want to think about it for another minute
I think I like your style ya'll
Why ya'll
Why don't we let go
Hey yo
And I ain't try to tell 'em
And I ain't try to sell 'em
It's YSL teddy
I ain't gotta spell it
And yes, I killa kill 'em
I guess I am the villain
I park on the curb, I'm the owner of the building
Ya deaf?
Boy me soon lef'
Come get this Playboy bunny like Hugh Hef
Sigh
Rastafari
Dutty dutty d-d-d-dutty

[Sean Kingston]
What if you would just come right out of these clothes
You can finally feel the wind when it blows
Don't be scared to be free to let go, show it off
Feel like letting go
Oh oh oh oh

Feel like letting go
Oh oh oh oh
Feel like letting go
Oh oh oh oh</pre>
