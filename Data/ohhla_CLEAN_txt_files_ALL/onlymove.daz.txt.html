[Intro: Daz]
Cruisin', doing our thang, you know what i mean...
Dat nigga Daz, Makaveli, check it out...

[2Pac]
Three words to make a motherfuckers heart burst
I rip the verse worse nigga when I start to curse
Picture a black hearse, adversaries buried in they sunday best
He blinked, died in the dark, my guns swing his chest
But will I die nigga, we all die, so until I die
Why must I ride on my enemies until they fry
Father forgive me because they not knowin
My glock cocked, niggas drop when my shots flowing
My definition of a thug niggaa
A multi-millionare, started as a drug dealer
I love niggas
open fire when I blast at ya
Everybody dies, bad boy massacre, I laugh at ya
Holla my name, I reappaer, like a G
No man alive can see me
Mutha Fukas making problems, but they get what they deserve
Get destroyed, with these three words, muthafucking...

(Chorus: Bad Azz)
Outlast, if we blast, Outlaw outcast
Only moving for the money so we coming up (so we comin' up)
We outlast if we blast, Outlaw outcast
Dont slip, nigga we ride

[Daz]
Its about more money, more dollars
More crack for the fiends, and more weed for the ballers
The spots hot, from all this ***ing bullshit
And recommended drug dealers
Getting richa for all my niggas
Then ball up, in memory
The state of my mind, it come right before me
So all you all ? scatter
run for heat, plus the power
trying to get rid of half these mutha fuckin bastards
They a hazard to the block, from the git
with all that bullshit
rhyming and talking, never put shit
back in the hood
So these mutha fukas think its all good.
If I die or go to jail, I cant quit
From illegal to legitamate
Incarcearated with the bloods and crips
They lock me down in the gang you know the spot G
They down to ride and down to shake with me

(Chorus: Bad Azz)
Outlast, if we blast, Outlaw outcast
Only moving for the money so we coming up (so we coming up)
We outlast if we blast, Outlaw outcast
Dont slip, nigga we ride

[2Pac]
fuck the world, feel the fury of the chosen man
thug nigga, 10mm close in hand
Put em in my range, aim nigga take fire
Watch em die, should've never fuck around when its time to ride
Riding low, down a one way, watch for gun play
Hoping we find true peace one day
Nobody cry when my dog died
Set em straight
AK automatically, retaliate

[Daz]
Dat nigga daz and makaveli on a mission
Saw the warrior like the style of the story ?
We worship the glory
Coming through on my entourage
Gettin loose
Prepare for the war, muthafuckin bring ya juice
Pray to God that your soul is right
Before you die tonight
In the group when we be ? and ridin all night
See the game ain't the same no more
All these motherfuckin niggas ain't the same no more
So we yellin
(Chorus: Bad Azz &amp; Daz)

Only moving for the money so we coming up
We outlast if we blast, Outlaw outcast
Dont slip, nigga we ride
(yeah)
Ride
(ride all night on they bitches)
We outlast if we blast, Outlaw outcast
(Niggas ain't afraid, we run up on your ass to blast)
Dont slip, nigga we ride
(Ride all night)....</pre>
