[Verse 1 - J. Cole]
I put my heart and soul in this game, I'm feelin drained
Unappreciated, unalleviated
Tired of comin up short, fuck abbreviated
Want my whole name spelled out, my own pain spilt out
No pain, no gain, I blow brains, Cobain
Throw flames, Liu Kang, the coach ain't help out
So, I call my own shots, I'm David Blaine
I'm breakin out of my own box, you stay the same
But homie if ya change, may ya change for the better
Back when Martin King had a thing for Coretta
Wonder if she seen all the +Dreams+ he was dreamin
Did she have a clue of all the schemes he was schemin?
Still loved him just enough to put up with the cheatin
Months go by and only see him for a weekend (uh)
I say a prayer and hope my girl ain't leavin
We all got angels, we all got demons
As you fall through the club
Bad bitches down to do all the above
Money comes fast, so bein hungry don't last
'Til you look in the mirror and you saw who you was (huh)
Cole World, it couldn't be more clearer
The time is now, it couldn't be more here-a
My reign gonna last like three-four eras
Say hello to the real, I can be your hero (huh)

[Chorus - J. Cole] - w/ ad libs
Hey, I'm a put us all on the map
I'm gone and I ain't lookin back
I know they gon' feel it/fill it like they tank on E
I promise baby, you can bet the bank on me
'Cause can't nobody tell me what I ain't gonna be no more
Ya thinkin I'm a fall, don't be so sure
I wish somebody made guidelines
On how to get up off the sidelines

[Verse 2 - J. Cole]
Up in first class, laugh even though it's not funny
See a white man wonder how the fuck I got money
While he sit in coach, hate to see me walk past 'em
Young, black, pants sag, headphones blastin
Know what he askin - "how did he manage?"
With all the cards against him, he used 'em to his advantage
Slang we be speakin probably soundin like Spanish
Then I fuck they heads up, when a nigga show manners
Some New York niggaz thought it was funny callin us "bamma"
Laughin at the grammar, 'cause they didn't understand us
Must've thought we slow, but, little do they know
I came up in here to take advantage of that shit y'all take for granted (huh)
Opportunity (uh), that I would kill for
Lookin at rappers like "what the fuck you got a deal for?"
When I was ass out with my funds low
It's nice to know I had the whole world at my front door

[Chorus] - w/ ad libs

[Verse 3 - J. Cole]
I made it to the Roc, even though they tried to box me out
I got the key to the game, they tried to lock me out
But what they don't understand is this is all planned
It's a bigger picture and you can't Photoshop me out
Some nigga ask me "why Jay never shout me out?"
Like I'm supposed to give a fuck, don't you know that I be out
in France, where the fans throw they hands like Pacquiao
Not 'cause my looks, 'cause my hooks could knock Rocky out
And my lines is designed from the heart
+Young Simba+ been a lion from the start
Dumb niggaz, y'all been lyin from the start
My life's like a movie, truly, and these niggaz is dyin for the part
But, you'll never play me like LeBron versus Jordan
Twenty years, wonder who they gon' say was more important
Both changed the game, came through and made a lane
Who's to say that who's greater? All we know, they ain't the same

[Chorus] - w/ ad libs</pre>
