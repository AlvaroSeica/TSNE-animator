[Intro:]
yo uh-huh
yessir
turn everything up some more
the drums you know, the music and shit
(holla back) I'm goin for it now
(holla back) yessir
(holla back) hey yo

[Verse 1:]
in the heart of a re-up, its sumthin like a g-up
M-C-A fingering that b-up or that c-up
fiends creep up with their flesh lookin beat up
and my tennis ball is stuffed with enough work to fill a tea cup
he opened up his jacket, I opened up my packet
he pulled out his money, I'm pullin out that honey
he stuff it in his stem* soon as he took it from me
yellow teeth chaffed lips and his nose is runny
he lit that shit, he hit that quick
as if I was high I asked him where them bricks at, shit
he smiled as if he was payin homege
he said in the back of the apartment where they be selling ganja
but beware of the AK held by HM Thomas
son gotta keep him high in them bottoms or some old pyjamas
I said shiiit ma nigga take another hiiit
we ran up in that crib with them Uzis and them Sigs
give up the work or we tyin up the kids
did I get that work? what you think, yes I did
I didn't, actually that wasnt true and if you aspire to hustle thats a
how-to to you

[stem-thin glass tube used for smoking crack]

[Chorus:]
this that shit make you wanna hustle
carry square guns shootin metal wit muffles
trunk full of cash wit a couple of duffles
so we can sip wine and eat a bundle of truffles

We gonna show you how to hustle (holla back)
so you can style all these sneakers (holla back)
so you can style all these sneakers (ya follow that)
so you can style all these sneakers (well follow dis)

[Verse 2:]
its incredible how I etch my plans out
to be physically subtle and financially stand out
you should see me stick that big S on my anso*
and literally call destructure so no one can touch ya
teenage girls'll love ya and models wanna fuck ya
ice cream ya way on to somebodys magazine cover
so much money that the lid threatens eruption and the bank says you dont
have to call like you're Usher
and I ain't kill or sell drugs to nobody
but I know niggas that kill and stretch work like pilates
nigga the crack house was literally right beside me
when them fiends hit that shit they kicked jus like karate
we named one bruce lie
one slim kelly who issued too much quicker than luis rank and m belly
yeah I escaped but theres nothing you can tell me
cause thought I paperchase my memories won't fail me

[anso-type of gun belt]

[Chorus:]
this that shit make you wanna hustle
carry square guns shootin metal wit muffles
trunk full of cash wit a couple of duffles
so we can sip wine and eat a bundle of truffles

We gonna show you how to hustle (holla back)
so you can style all these sneakers (holla back)
so you can style all these sneakers (ya follow that)
so you can style all these sneakers (well follow dis)

[Verse 3:]
in the hood wake up to the hammer noise
sound like the work of my jerks the swagger boys
pull up and them eyes wide open
stack of toys
if your girl want to leave with us thats her choice
the feelin throbbin I got it and poppin phenomanal
nigga signed a million dollar cheque wit his pyjamas on
film it like a porno no need to re-word it
nigga the enzo jus came and I aint have to jerk it
yeah niggas you heard it the perversion of stars
I guess if I go in my garage it'd be a menage
niggas cant hate on this like summer in '84
when we high off potato chips
new cript and florida were the soul core corridors
yes them babies mine, fuck I need to go on my reefa
rewire my brain, aspire to attain
tell jacob light on the platinum keep the fire in the chain
yikes I mean ice on the motherfucker gleam
I guess if my ice is fire it leave you niggas stinged
see theres you theres me and theres between
if you remove the between you see I achievin you dreams

[Chorus:]
this that shit make you wanna hustle
carry square guns shootin metal wit muffles
trunk full of cash wit a couple of duffles
so we can sip wine and eat a bundle of truffles

We gonna show you how to hustle (holla back)
so you can style all these sneakers (holla back)
so you can style all these sneakers (ya follow that)
so you can style all these sneakers (well follow dis)</pre>
