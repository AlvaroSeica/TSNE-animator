[Intro]
Ey yo, these demons are battlin'
Talkin' to God, askin' him
Help me to do good
I can't go back to being bad again
Straddlin' the lanes of right or wrong and what's happenin'
I do it for a minute
Hit the gas and fuckin' crash again

[Verse 1]
I'm travelin' recklessly
Swearin' that there's a hex on me
Constantly caught between both sadness and ecstasy
Lacking the exact recipe
Trapped and you can't rescue me
Steadily, I'm trying to break out and build a legacy
Ill without a remedy
Buildin' up all this energy
Until the thrill of victory is killed by another penalty
Mentally I stay two steps ahead of my enemy
Incredibly, blessed and skilled with all of my weaponry
Restlessly awaitin' the day they started addressin' me
Was more than just an average man
Pourin' his heart relentlessly
Born without identity
Torn and it keeps compressin' me
Storms are formin' next to me
No overdose!
Serenity!
I'm sinnin'
Beginnin' to feel that this evil's winnin'
I'm slippin'
Forgettin' that I'm even a Christian
A villain
Wanting everything that's forbidden
Livin' in contradictions
To all of my convictions
I listen
To men and women making predictions
That elevate, beyond all the stated restrictions
I'm placed in prison
Underneath these strict conditions
Tryin' to escape so I can release these sacred visions

[Hook x2]
Ey yo, I'm tryin' to reach the masses
But I remain lost here in this cold engrossin' sea of blackness
Drownin' in the sadness
I'm just prayin' that God can help me find some peace amongst the madness

[Verse 2]
Just when I feel the cold comin'
Numbin' till I feel nothing'
No counterpain, no lovin'
Stumblin'
My hope plummetin'
I see a rose buddin'
From where the cement was crumblin'
Rose to my feet with no trouble, all of a sudden..
I knew just how to break free
They tried to encase me
They tried to misplace me
Deny my masonry
But the work of these hands
Was not guided by man
I supply the demands
And comply with God's commands
I tried to withstand all of the laughter and slams
Slander and scams
All of the bands who've been damned
I couldn't take it no more
Gettin' ignored
While all these others before
Always got phrased to the door
I waited to score
I would'a traded places with y'all
But now I understand what all of this was trainin' for
See, I'm the comin' attraction
Catchin' you cats nappin'
Wrapped in a padded ?? new Jacks
Couldn't fathom
Eager to start attacking
Leavin' the baddest flattened
Question my heart in this
And I'll smack you rats for askin'
Extractin' all of my passion into these rhymes
Until that which was blackened, finally shines
This is my callin'
There ain't no more stallin' for time
Hearts don't lie, so you know I'm followin' mine
