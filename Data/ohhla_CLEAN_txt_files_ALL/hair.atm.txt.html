"And she still wonders why I'm so insecure, she
giggles cuz I sleep with a..." (sample from "Body Pillow")

Girl: Could I throw, like, pennies on stage? So I
couldn't be a fuckin groupie and just fuck you cuz
you're on stage and others of us want to fuck you?
Slug: See bands like us don't get groupies
Girl: No
Slug: Yea
Girls: You're so full of bullshit
Slug: No, its not full of shit, I mean, have you ever
heard our songs? I mean, basically... exactly, that's what I'm saying

Smile, smile with me, smile with me, smile with me,
please won't you smile, smile with me, smile with me,
smile with me, please won't you...
Oh look at her she's lookin as good as dinner
and she's lookin back at me as if maybe I'm a winner
I'm in my late twenties little girl don't flirt with me
I've got the capabilities to program your circuitry
You don't have to believe, do yourself a little justice
don't let Slug undercook your muffins
Oh wait, did I say that? I did? Must be losing it
cuz it almost felt that it might just have some truth in it
Now back to the platter at hand
she said she's 21 and quit school to go work for the man
A switch up in the plan, now she's happy as a chorus
cuz now she makes rent and now she drives a Taurus
Unwindin and hangin out at the bar
I wonder if she knows that I'm not really a star
She seems to be impressed with my lack of an ego and
my self-aware style, I like the way that she smiles
She wanna know how I find the words I use
I don't really know but I can lie if you want me to
Angels sing to me in my sleep
I sold my damaged soul for the magic of speak
Now she's laughin, she likes the sarcasm
Naturally, I'm askin if she's got a captain
A captain? You mean a man at home? The answer is no
I came to this bar alone
Well heaven's to Betty, enough about boyfriends already
just tryin to keep the conversation petty
As much as I would love to run and play in the forest
ain't no way this girl is gonna break into my fortress

I've never made a practice, of introducing the mattress
to women that I meet at my own gig
I don't know, can't imagine anything as small as
alcohol and hormones turning out to be anything big
Baby's hella beautiful, even kinda bright
I've got the fire of a vampire inside me tonight
It might be alright, everything seems tight
I've got a good buzz and she's giving me the green light
So tell me girl, what you doin after?
She says hopefully hangin out with my new favorite rapper
Now wait a minute, thats not fair, you're throwin boulders
I can tell by the way your hair touches your shoulders
Be straight with me and I'll be mean with you
I can think of some of us that we should do
So if you think I'm coming home with you tonight
you're probably right(probably right)
A few more beers, a couple more laughs,
undressing my past with the questions she asked
Yes, I love cats and I would love to take a bath
If I would spend the night, would you massage my back?

She's closin in for the embrace
and slightly tucks her head under my face
her hair smells so good, I gotta have a taste
where's your Ford, let's ditch this place
In the parking lot, she sparked it off
she must be starving for someone to hit the heart
I've never been kissed with such passionate bliss
pornstar damn near tore my lips apart
honey slow it up, hold it up, start the car and
leave this garage, lets go to your apartment
Lendale Avenue, on the way to her rest
her drunk ass turns to look at me and she says,
"You're so beautiful from the hair to the soul
I can't believe that I've never met you before
it feels like I've been waiting for you my whole life."
She missed the red light, hit a pickup truck and we both died
