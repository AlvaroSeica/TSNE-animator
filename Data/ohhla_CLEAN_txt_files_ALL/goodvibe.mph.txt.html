* Good Vibes (Remix) has the same lyrics

[Muph]
And I can smell clearly
Well I can smell clearly now
Well I can smell clearly now the shit is gone
And I can lift my weight nearly now that I'm feeling strong
I'm touching the ceiling now that my arms are long
Feels like nothing I want belongs out of my reach
I'm on the beach avoiding the syringes
I'm at the pub talking to the bingers
And I can feel my fingers becoming a little bit numb
After the last one said just to pull out my thumb
Someone became a lump sum, this one son's life
But I was wearing the disguise, tryna improvise
Then I realised and put away the actor
Buried the fake chump with a tractor
Grabbed the protractor and matched up the fine lines
Wrote down the guidelines to make the most of my timeline
On the sideline my mind slips
But it's all cool cause I can longer smell the shit
No matter how hard I whiff
I'll take guard and hold a firm grip
I'll twist through the turns, I'll flip when I'm concerned
And when I'm down I'll yearn for the heart to burn
So I know it's still there

[Nick Sweepah]
Yeah, let the beat relax you like an open fire
And chill with friends and fam you respect and admire
Quit tryna find the perfect anything
Contradiction yeah, but from the past I've learnt many things
Everything's cool, plus this FG beat
Would make any tool get out of their seat and act a fool
Actual events from the past are brought to back to mind
All that was fine from that time comes in the form of rhyme
Like one night at Revolver I dissolved a potential situation of nervousness
By perving with Murs at chicks outside Obese
So the performance later on was a natural release
Talking shit with a hero of yours, that's a good vibe
As good as the first time you saw Hilltop Hoods live
We should thrive on these moments but the human condition is hopeless
Focus on just what's in front of you
Drink with my mate Gram, wait man I'll grab another brew
And chill with the crew, just got to call my bro Shwiss
It'll be the kind of night that we won't wanna miss
A good vibe, one you don't wanna miss!

[Mu] It's love, lust, sex and beer
[NS] Never mind what you thought, you should be doing here
[Mu] It's years and perhaps beers to keep your conscious clear
[NS] It's your mates rocking round to shout the good gear
[Mu] It's passion, action and those joyful tears
[NS] Getting pissed and saying "You're the best man, cheers"
[Mu] It's bouncing tits, undone zips and juicy wrists
[NS] Hearing this song when your home channel's to your ear
[Mu] It's broken fears holding it dear so near
[NS] Diving deep when the water is just clean and clear
[Mu] It's staying up late to collaborate with your peers
[NS] It's Sweepah and Muphin up on stage, hell yeah!</pre>
