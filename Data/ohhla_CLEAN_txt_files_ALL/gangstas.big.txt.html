Now ain't this a bitch
Them niggas got my name
In some police shit
I don't sell no crack
But I can sell you some raps
I've did that shit for 12 years
And all I got was 12 years worth of fuckin tears
I lost my cars, I lost my cribs
I got shot a bunch of times
Friends told on friends
My baby momma say that she loves me
Then I got them hoes up in the street that want to fuck me
And ride around in my shit intel they free to suck my dick
Lickin on my balls, cause I took them all to the mall
Baby, I'm a millionaire call me a boss player
I had fun on the run

So this is for the

I'm tired stayin up late, I done lost to much weight
And peepin out the window every 15 mother fuckin minutes
I'm tired of Babys askin me were I'm goin to
Am I comin home, ( I HOPE I DO)
When I see your next Birthday
Baby I can't say, I play out these hills
Just to see another year, every gangster likes hoes, and clothes and cars
I can't be your daddy and a fuckin rap star
Black folks keep strugglin to make it
And everything we get, the police try to take it
They want to find out how I am livin down south
And send me to the feds, and a auction on my house
Put my name in the newspapers, call me a mince
And send me to the pin, with a mandatory 10
I ain't proud of won't I did, I ain't mad cause I done it
The cookies make the cakes, and cakes make the money

So you think want to be like Mr. Mother fuckin Biggs, huh
You want your head full of gray hair
You want to shot niggas and get shot up
Then take your stupid ass right there and do it then

I might get a chance to see the streets before I'm old
Keep a clean record they might give me parole
50/50 chance that I make it, I don't know, I know I am ready to leave
But they ain't ready to let me go
I am on my bed, thinking about some shit a bitch done said
I'm sittin down on my walk, with a number on my forehead
Dogg, this shit has got me in some danger, my mother fuckin gangstas niggas
