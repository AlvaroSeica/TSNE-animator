[Phonte]
She's the light of my world
And I try to keep it cool but she knows it
Yeah, she knows it baby, yeah
And if I ever had the chance to be yours
I'd give my all to you and be the keeper of your flame
It's your day, hey 

[Chorus]
If someone loves you back
Don't get in the way, don't hold it back
Don't wait
Ooh, don't wait
Ooh, don't wait  

[Darien Brockington]
Oh, I love her
Make my heart beat like a drum
Feel the rhythm getting stronger
(What we're feeling is love
 And I hope it's enough
 Tell me your deepest thoughts) 
You don't have to be afraid
Girl, I keep your secrets safe (I promise)
Girl, we are the lucky ones
That's why I wanna spend my lifetime with you 

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
(Uh, let's break it down)
Your love puts me on a cloud
Hope I never come down
Cause I'm in love with you
Your love puts me on a cloud
Hope I never come down
(Uh yo, to the floor)

[Chorus]</pre>
