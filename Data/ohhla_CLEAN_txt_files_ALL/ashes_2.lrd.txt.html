[Stack Bundles]
The walls have ears, little nigga, I hear when you talk
And speak of me when you mention New York
Probably heard about the jewels and cars, fam, I run around
With some wild ass niggas from the jungle, I'm Tarzan
Harlem with my G-Unit niggas, got my Dip Set niggas
Out in Q.U., better know who's who
Try and pull a damn stunt, my young bulls
Be chasing you around the hood like niggas was playing manhunt
Still trade goods like the pilgrims and the Indians
Couple E pills'll bring the fifty and the skinnies in
Circling that two-tone, listening to Many Men
I'm on my phone, but my lap got the semi in
I hear the gossip, niggas is fronting
They ain't poking nothing, they ain't pop nothing, but still stunting
Come the toys, I done had bout four
All parked in the P's, while I went out on tour
Ya'll were starving in the drought, all out on war
Only borrow for a quarter, I was out all four
You know, what goes up, must come down
So when the coke prices go up, we run out of town

[Chorus: Stack Bundles]
They say ashes to ashes and dust to dust
Live for today, tomorrow ain't promised to us
You know life's too short to sit around and complain
Live it up, so when I'm gone, you gon' remember my name

[Lord Superb]
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
From Hamels to Hasick, who's fucking with us?
International dons, niggas live and shit
I was born with a chaffeur, I ain't never drive shit
Skii'd up, coke all in my mink sleeve
Fuck the green, tell 'em roll up a pink weed
Perb's back in the building, ya'll can put ya'll mics down
Only niggas getting money is niggas that's nice now
No auto-tune, dances or nothing
And I ain't got to leave the mansion for nothing
For ya'll niggas, that think we, just drive Porsches
I have seventy niggas outside your P.O. office
Ya'll fools living the rock life
I'm living the give me this and that, this, I don't want that, like
That's right, I'm running the hood, fam
Perb's like AllState, so the shit's in good hands

[Chorus]</pre>
