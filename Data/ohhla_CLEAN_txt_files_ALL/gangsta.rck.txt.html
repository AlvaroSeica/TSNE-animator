Verse 1:
Declare war at thirty-three and a third
You never saw all you heard was the word
That they had me on the block handcuffed in a search
With they knees on my neck and my head on the curb
Yea right
Never in your wildest dreams
Could you deal with this gangsta lean straight from Queens
Young fly don, I hit ya, split ya scene
Pushin limousines through murder scenes and fiends**
Cops rope off this block
No hold game  **
Fresh down to the socks
Gold rope chain
Flow is propane
Own it's own flame
Between the profound and profane I throw game
I came in this game and learned to play hard
Same hard as Eric B and the god and James Todd
Rap Morpheus, pull y'all out the graveyard
While y'all choose the blue pill tryna stay hard

(Hook)
Bounce come on
Bounce come on
Gangsta
One shot in the chamber
Load when I'm ready to go
Set to explode when its danger
Ready to blow so here we go now
I know money makes the world go round (go round)
I won't stop 'til I'm world-renowned
And you know we gonna party 'til the world go down
Non-stop 'til we burn it down
To the T.O.P.

Verse 2:
Gear switchin'
Hittin' switches
Spokes in the distance
Smoke and emission
Smooth when I cruise
Boulevards, avenues
Go hard win or lose
Go head make a move
Five star general sargeant, department
Stores what I swarm for designer uniforms
One stop shop when I cop and put it on
Garment renaissance like whatever Wu was on
Eye shaded when it's warm
Ice heavy on the arm
Eye candy on the arm
I get it then I'm gone now
One by one hit 'em up like a pump shot
151 lay 'em out like a mugshot
Have another round
When I come around
Even unannounced
Got 'em handin over pounds
I'm holding it down
Supplyin the sounds
For homeboys ridin' around
Enjoyin the sound I'm on

(Hook)
Bounce come on
Bounce come on
Gangsta
One shot in the chamber
Load when I'm ready to go
Set to explode when its danger
Ready to blow so here we go now
I know money makes the world go round (go round)
I won't stop 'til I'm world-renowned
And you know we gonna party 'til the world go down
Non-stop 'til we burn it down
To the T.O.P.

Verse 3:
I make the speakers shake
Make your sneakers ache
D.O.D. horizontal figure eight
Means I don't die
On this track I regulate
Crates with every break
Breaks with heavy bass
I chill your ice grill
Steal your nice girl
Turn out the lights while you payin the light bill
Burn out your pipe while I'm burnin this mic still
Heard I was nice
How'd he learn how to write?
Dope in the flow, I leave em leanin, feenin
King on this board, I move it even, team
You a rook, you a pawn I'mma take your queen
And take her back to the spot in Jamaica Queens
It go

(Hook)
Bounce come on
Bounce come on
Gangsta
One shot in the chamber
Load when I'm ready to go
Set to explode when its danger
Ready to blow so here we go now
I know money makes the world go round (go round)
I won't stop 'til I'm world-renowned
And you know we gonna party 'til the world go down
Non-stop 'til we burn it down
To the T.O.P.
