Yo

[Verse 1]
I kills the hoe how I builds the dough
Ed chills the doe and won't go below
I live my life and I get the type of
Vibe that get the vapors to write
Snakes in the grass make it hard to pass
If they add to my stash then fuck 'em in the ass
Suspicions of a bitch even if she aint conspicuous
Entertainment fame changed it up that's ridiculous
I just reminisce on the chick that was sucking my dick
If a bitch wanna get on some other shit
I just call the other chick like *bing, bing, bing*
You know the type that droppin off quick

[Chorus]
I'm killing her on the one, I'm killing you on the two
I stack the loot like a Jew, I kills a G on the three
I kill a whore on the four, open like a door
I'm killing her on the one, I'm killing you on the two
As usual, I kill a G on the three, I killed a whore on the four

[Verse 2]
Check the technique and the style that I'm freaking
High on a weekday, drunk on the weekend
You'll never know that I fucked your hoe
But if you find out that's alright though
I'm off to the next state, I got more chicks to meet
But Scott Lark is feeling this way
It's time to scoop up your hoe and take her to the 'mo
Then hit the studio then drive around ??my rope??
I caught a full fledged hitting skins missing your
with no permiss-ion, and when I'm gone niggas be all
One and a two, tres, and a four
It's almost five o'clock and I aint busting no more...
So bring the noise and what the fucking thing you were sleeping over for
And just to stop on the tour
Back to your relationship
I know you're gonna miss my dick
Although I did explode quick
I'm the hip-hopper, fly boot knocker
to the tick-tocker, you just don't stop uh
Man...

[Chorus]
I'm killing her on the one, I'm killing you on the two
I stack the loot like a Jew, I kill a G on the three
I killed a whore on the four, open like a door
I'm kills her on the one, I'm killed you on the two
As usual, I killed a G on the three
I kills the whore on the four for all of y'all

[Verse 3]
Well I went up to my girl's crib, guess what I saw
This cock diesel nigga taking off her drawls
So now you know the flavor when it's time to flex
That nigga fucked mine and yours might be next
It kind of hurts man, what you didn't hit yet
Even get vexed when you find that I get wrecked
Scott Lark got your hoe wide open
On the down-low and she be out scopin'
Man, I tell you like this
Bitch, bitch, bitch
I just, give some old shit, get you open

[Chorus]
I'm killing her on the one, I'm killing you on the two
(Bring it back, bring it back)
I stack the loot like a Jew, I kill a G on the three
I kills the whore on the four
Open like a door, door, door

I kill a hoe like this
I kill a bitch like that
I kill a hoe like this, yeah, yeah

Word is bond, all the bitches and the hoes
On the down low, see me on the down low, see me on the down low
Yeah to all my niggas, yeah, to my motherfuckin' niggas
To my niggas, to my niggas
Word is bond, like that</pre>
