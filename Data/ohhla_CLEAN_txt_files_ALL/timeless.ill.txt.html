[Illa J]
Yeah (this sound like a groove an' shit)

[singing]
I spend so much time, just thinkin 'bout nothin
Now it's time to turn, that nothin into somethin
And see if that somethin wants to be with me
And we could be together, live happily
I spend so much time, just on nothin
I think it's time for me to start, doin somethin
Find me a fine activity
Enjoy this life of liberty

[Chorus]
Timeless, everything is
Time just, keep on movin
I just, keep on movin
Life just, keep on movin..
Keep on movin
Life just, keep on movin
Keep on movin
Timeless...

{*piano plays solo for a while*}

[singing]
I spend so much time, just livin in a bubble
I just wanna lay back and stay out of trouble
I think it's time for me to break out the shell
And I can't be afraid to failllll
I spend so much time outside my mind
That I can't tell if I'm in or outside my mind
It's time for me to come to reality
And use my creativity

[Chorus]

[Illa J]
Yeah, timeless
Timeless</pre>
