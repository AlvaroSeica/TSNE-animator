Album:  The Fantastic Reality
Song:   This is the Happiest Song That I Ever Did Wrote
Typed by: timespkicker@aol.com

this is the happiest song that I ever did wrote
its filled with fantastic lies, cigarettes and jokes
it involves coffee, yellow teeth and dirt stained hands
it involves paragraphs and sentences like
everything is planned
no one is damned
theres just a few too many logs of ignorance in the way
so what can I say
so our mind gets dammed
its about shoveling snow in all hours of the night
it shines like an angel, and bites like a cat
you feel like you made it to heaven
then the street lights take you back
but this place is far from hell
cause hell is in your insecures and fears
but it'd be sad not to have any problems so the guilt steers
you into depression so you don't stick out
so your smiles are like the
big bad wolf blowing the big brick house
but this is just a ghost story
told in the reality where I'm from
cause this is the happiest song I ever did wrote for someone
its for you

this is the happiest song that I ever did wrote
happiest song that I ever did wrote 
this is the happiest song that I ever did wrote
happiest song that I ever did wrote 

theres no negatives in this song
theres no right cause cuz no one is wrong
when rome burned did it keep the outskirts warm?
if it wasn't iron would the curtain be torn?
ah the fire trucks sound like lullabies
and the laughter sounds like a little babies cry
but there's nothing like a violin waking you up
whether it hits you're ears or the top of your head
love your addictions cuz by the time you stop you'll be dead
I like to write cuz writing helps
I take all my problems and put em on the record shelf
this song is happy, cuz all it contains is apathy
I forgave the guilt, murdered the ego and killed the tragedy
now theres nothing to do but smile
all I do is grin, cuz none of this real
not even your religion or sin
god is happy, he helped me write this song
you're fear is the future, anger makes you strong
but muscles have nothing to do with love
and neither does sex, and that's because
there's a thing called lust and it stomps on trust
when desire's a plus, self control's a must
my ego had 9 lives now its 54 feet deep
I woke up enlightened now there's no need for sleep
this world's an illusion created by me
and when I look in her eyes it's god that I see
we're all the same soul, just a projection of guilt
and if you're unhappy only forgiveness'll  help
aliens, ants and angels are just as fake as us
so burn your money if god you trust
but this is just science fiction
told in the reality where I'm from
cause this is the happiest song I ever did wrote for someone
its for you

this is the happiest song that I ever did wrote
happiest song that I ever did wrote 
this is the happiest song that I ever did wrote
