[Intro]
Ay yessir

[Saigon]
I could be parallel to bad as hell, equivalent to ignorant
Depends on the matter, well if it's that insignificant
I just have to tell a nigga to kick rocks with flip-flops
Rappers rather tell than sit in a cell, this is snitch-hop
I ain't payin the disc jock', he ain't gettin the wristwatch
I'm the realest to make it, he takin dick in the shit box
I kinda get why I'm legit, mostly to the folks who think dominant
I see why dishonest shit is so prominent
See the kids that's rhymin it that ain't lived not a line of it
You ain't hood money, not good money, you're counterfeit
The kind of a john I get on some low-low for line of shit
Interstate 9-5'in it, with that coke and them llamas bitch
Hol' up; what time is it? The clock strike ten
I guarantee none of y'all be on the block like him
Cock the fifth back you get baffled, click-clack you skedaddle
Lot of niggaz bust they guns but not like them (but not like them)
The record labels are scared of me, internet gotta bag me
First they said I was gangsta, then they said not exactly
I rap about politicians, rap about protect
The loser maneuvers and Edgar Hoover re-enacted
Bein I'm on my black shit, they be tryin to silence me
But to do that shit, they'll have to do it violently
Clack-clack that Mac back, brrrat-tat-tat, clap that
Lot of niggaz bust they guns but not like them (but not like them!)

[Styles P]
A lot of niggaz bust they guns but not like them
Y'all niggaz is lukewarm, y'all ain't hot like them
Them motherfuckers my brothers, they are not my friends
We the band with the bond, from grams on the - (again)
A lot of niggaz bust they guns but not like them
Y'all niggaz is lukewarm, y'all ain't hot like them
Them motherfuckers my brothers, they are not my friends
We the band with the bond, from grams on the arm
to uncut dope, ya had to land on a farm
Rappin in arenas, rubberbands to the mobs
Gettin high to Sinatra, in the sands of the palms
Reminiscin my rappin with Big, the man was a don
Niggaz did it big but, not like them
Drink champagne in the ocean just to drown my sins
Should've prayed when valet, pull around my Benz
Cause niggaz know my beginnin but, not my end
Yeah, it's me and Saigon and the paisans
Never behind us like we Verizon
Go 'head and chill out, get your vibe on
Cause this could be the day that you died on

[Outro: Saigon]
But not like them, but not like them
Carenard, I don't think people really understand that Saigon guy
That guy's a different breed
Yeah yeah, see, savin Private Brian
Savin Private Briiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiian</pre>
