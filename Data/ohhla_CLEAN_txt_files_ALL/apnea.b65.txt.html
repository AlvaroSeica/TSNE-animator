[spoken]:
In my darkness
I speak now upon this object of nature
And now upon that
And find it impossible to soothe my restless head
However much I wish it
This perpetual action of mine deprives me almost wholly of sleep 
 
(Buck 65):
I haven't slept, sleep being the cousin of death
And as I lay there awake at night there wasn't a breath
That exited my body that didn't coincide
With the recycled evaluation of feelings that I know inside
Boy Scouts have had their way with my stomach
And a marionette hangs limply from my most important muscle
I simply can't imagine living on the moon
Hope that I can climb my way back to dreamland pretty soon

(Buck 65):
Prosthetic throwing arm, isn't it fantastic?
I won a one way ticket to hell in a handbasket
It seems like I got it made, and then I begin to feel
Like I'd give up all my winnings for another chance to spin the wheel
I don't know if I have a prayer or a hope in heaven
All I know is that I'm afraid to read my horoscope
It makes me wanna holler or at least let out a yell
I'd give up my next life if I thought that it would help
I don't wanna play no more, I just wanna get to sleep
Cuz most likely sleep will let me forget about the other people 
That haven't been able to make me stop feeling
Like demons are hiding the walls and in the ceiling
My catcher always told me you can't hit what you can't see
Your absence actually aggravates my fancy
And my own stubble tickles me and irritates my sensitive skin
I'm surprised at how uninventive I've been 
I'm frozen, but my mind's made up and I've chosen
To lock the door behind the next person that goes in
Raindrops keep falling on my cheeks
And on my trusty little halo over my head, and so it's getting rusty
I've been poked by so many fingers
That getting poked by fingers don't bother me no mo'
I feel like a jellyfish, uncephalized, uncivilized
Unspecified, unspecialized
Currents carry me, my own endurance buries me
Deterrents make me weary, so I wear this ring for reassurance
Currents carry me, my own endurance buries me
Deterrents make me weary, so I wear this ring for reassurance</pre>
