[Intro: sample of Mike Epps' stand-up from "Under Rated &amp; Never Faded"]
Married men act totally different when they're by themselves, don't they?
You see 'em with their wife, "What's up Tony?"
"Hey man, how's everything going brother?"
 Aw just taking it easy, hanging out with the old lady.
 Alright, God bless you, take it easy now, alright."
Be like that nigga ain't like that!
You see him by himself, "What's up Tony?"
"HEY, where's the bitches at nigga?! Where's the bitches?!"

[J. Cole]
Yeah, give me my space, Lord ain't enough time to chase
all these dreams, knahmean, I got no time to wait
Love my girl but I told her straight up, "Don't wait up"
Stumble home late, I'm drunk, we fucked then made up
Used to livin free as a bird but now I'm laid up
Feelin like a nigga got handcuffs on
How the fuck did my life become a damn love song?
She ride for a nigga and she stand up for him
But a nigga wan' be a nigga, be a nigga
Ride through the streets with freaks and real niggaz
She'll never understand what it's like to be a man
knowin when you look inside yourself, you see a nigga
And you don't wanna let her down
But you too young for the settle down
And maybe you can thug it out, learn what is love about
When you can't live with her and you can't live without
Aw shit, God damn, I think the devil got his hands on me
Strippers sayin, "Baby won't you throw them bands on me?"
And I came to spend
She pop a molly let the motherfuckin games begin
I'm runnin

[Chorus: J. Cole]
Runaway, runaway, runaway, runaway
I'm holdin on desperately
Runaway, runaway, runaway, runaway
I'm holdin on

[J. Cole]
When it's all said and done everybody dies
In this life ain't no happy endings, only pure beginnings
followed by years of sinnin and fake repentance
The preachers say that we were made in image of Lord
To which I replied, "Are you sure?
Even the murderer? Even the whore?
Even the nigga runnin through bitches on tour?"
With a good girl at home foldin clothes and shit
She losin faith in him and he knows it, shit
Like what the fuck is a break? Don't know how much I can take no more
I give you all I got 'til it ain't no more
No more tears, it's been ten long years damn near
I don't know if I can wait no more
And, who could blame her? You complain a-bout
every time you out, you come back, she pout
Sleepin back to back, this is wack, we 'bout
to go platinum and I'm in the crib actin out
my childhood fantasies of, wife and home
But it's a whole lot of actresses I'd like to bone
And despite the rumors you hold out, on account of your guilt
That she has got to spend her nights alone
And she +Ryde or Die+, like Eve and 'em
Make home-cooked meals every evening
And even in your lowest days
When you're no longer Superman at least you know you got Lois Lane
But you

[Chorus]

[J. Cole]
Yeah, unbelievable, seen evil/Evel that not even Knievel know
At age 3 I knew this world was three below
Listen, even though my ego low achieve the unachievable
Imaginin my confidence was halfway decent yo
This +Just-in+, fuck more bitches than Bieber though
Still I keep it low, got my niggaz on a need-to-know
basis, my manager back in the days was racist
I was a young boy, passin skates and tuckin laces
Old perverted white man who told me, "Jermaine
It's all pink on the inside, fuck what color they face is"
Wise words from an indecent man
Made me reflect on them times when we was three-fifths of them
In chains and powerless, brave souls reduced to cowardice
Slavin in the bakin sun for hours just
to see the master creep into the shack where your lady at
Nine months later got a baby, that's
not quite what you, expected but you
refuse to neglect it, cause you
know your wifey love you, thus you refuse to accept it
That's that type shit that turn my granny light-skinned
Rich white man rule the nation still
Only difference is we all slaves now, the chain's concealed
in our thoughts, if I follow my heart to save myself
Could I run away from 50 mil' like Dave Chappelle?
You know

[Chorus]</pre>
