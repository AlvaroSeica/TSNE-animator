[mc chris]
Maybe I need some rehab
Or maybe just need some sleep
I've got a sick obsession
I'm seein it in my dreams
I'm lookin down every alley
I'm makin those desperate calls
I'm staying up all night hopin
hittin my head against the wall

[Chorus]
The drugs you've got boy, are hard to find
I think about them, all the time
My brain's on drugs these, eggs are fried
I just can't get drugs, off my mind
Because I love I love I love - doin drugs
I love, I love, I love
Because I love I love I love - doin drugs
I love, I love, I love

[mc chris]
Won't listen to any advice
Moms tellin me I should think twice
But left to my own devices
I'm addicted, it's a crisis
My friends think I've gone crazy
My judgment's gettin kinda hazy
My steez is gonna be affected
If I keep it up like a real life crackhead

[Chorus]

[mc chris]
I don't care what people say
The rush is worth the price I pay
I get so high when I smoke weed
But crash and crave when the bag's empty
HEY~!!!
So I've got a question?
Do you want to do some bong hits in my basement?
Does it make your heart beat when you see a really big nugg?
Do you want to do, some drugs?
Some drugs? Some drugs? Some drugs?
Do you want to do, some drugs?
For real

[repeat 8X]
Because I love I love I love - doin drugs
I love, I love, I love

[mc chris]
Hey, heeey
Sooo... mhmmhmm
I love, I love, I love, I love
{*whispered*} doin drugs
I hate my beard</pre>
