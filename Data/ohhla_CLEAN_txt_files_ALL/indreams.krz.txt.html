Christopher?
Christopher, it's time to wake up

[Verse 1: Krizz Kaliko]
I keep having dreams of you and
Me eating ice cream together
I wake up and scream cause you're not
Lying next to me forever
You gone
So my thoughts are puttin' you away, it's ok
I know that you with him, so I guess I'm pulling OJ
Various, but I be curious is he touching you the same way
Than I used to attacking, sack it like it was game day
I usually got good intentions
But I'm kinda re-lightin' your house up
Like it's incense
Nobody can put in their two cents
She's clueless, but still can get it
Anybody can kill or live it
I need them pills or a medic
If you was me, would you still have did it? (No)
We reconcile with a child, in a domicile
They differ awhile but I keep thinking
Life is sometimes darker than it seems
But luckily it's only in my dreams
Mama saying

[Chorus: Barbara Ward]
Only in my dreams
See, the world ain't it seems to be
In my dreams
Only in my dreams
What ain't real to you is real to me
In my dreams
Only in my dreams
Only in my

[Verse 2: Brotha Lynch Hung]
I used to love her so much
More than I love these cigarettes
More than I love these internet (girls)
But it still ain't even went in her yet
Still ain't even a minute yet
Deal my dinner like any sex
Might've been off her like 20 sacks
Paranoid, nervous
Waiting in the bushes
Waiting for her to push them curtains
Take em, making me dirt quick
Perfect, I'm a murk it
I'm a soak it, need to seep it
Leak it, I'm a be eating it up like Peking
These things bout to surface
Her husband don't like me
I think he's cursed us
First just, I'm a stab him
And put him up in them hearses
Worsens
He just thinks my daughter is a splittin image
Wait to spit her, and didn't finish
Hate this rigorous, get this finished
Lick my lips right after I'm finished
I might just turn it on me and use it
I feel like I'm pretty useless
So I'm sippin on these two fifths
Scraping off my tooth's
See, death is not a theme
So I'm a lean out the bushes
What am I thinking?
Wait, mama's saying

[Chorus: Barbara Ward]
Only in my dreams
See, the world ain't it seems to be
In my dreams
Only in my dreams
What ain't real to you is real to me
In my dreams
Only in my dreams
Only in my

[Verse 3: Big Scoob]
This must be a dream
I'm seeing things I've never seen in my life
No more fiends
I'm with the team that got me scheming for flight
In this dream, it's all wicked
Man, the dark is the light
The black is the white
It's different they don't follow my plight
Gutter gems and Gutter hems
I don't toy with the light
I'm not grim so to them I don't belong in this life
Spit it different, how I lived it
When I be rocking the mic
Know rap, it's spitting
Just my vision how I journey through life
So suck it up and keep it pushing
I'm a stomp on your haters
Enjoy my days, rock the stage
And keep my faith in the sake
Don't get complacent, can't forsake
In this world of replacement
I can taste it, time to take it
All my life has been wasted
Some hate it, some love it
But I'm building a team
A rock star, Gutter music
Watch my life on the screen
A epic thriller, like Godzilla
I get stripped from your screams
Please don't wake me from this dream
Man I love when she sings
Mama sing

[Chorus: Barbara Ward]
Only in my dreams
See, the world ain't it seems to be
In my dreams
Only in my dreams
What ain't real to you is real to me
In my dreams
Only in my dreams
Only in my</pre>
