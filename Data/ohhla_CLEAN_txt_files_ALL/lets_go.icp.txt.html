aint nobody jealous
everybody has they own
nobody locked up
everybody
everybody is free to roam
look at that scrubby (jus chillin)
wit a hottie on his side
look at them rich kids, poor kids
everybody
together on the same side
and they down to ride

lets go all the way
(lets go all the way)
lets go all the way
lets go high high high
lets go all the way

aint nobody left out
everybody gets to go
it could never be too crowded
come on 
we still pickin up some mo'
dont nobody hate you, playa hate you
there aint no hate at all
gotta hold out thier hands and catch you
they'll catch you
and they never will let you fall
you aint gotta worry all day long

lets go all the way
(lets go all the way)
lets go all the way
lets go high high high
lets go all the way

never no syphillis
no syphillis
nobody has to die
nobody has to die
everythings answered 
right then and there
never have to wonder why
(you never have to wonder why no oh)
wont nobody rush you
no program
be as long as you wanna be
can you guess what this place is?
your future
make it a reality
all you have to do is follow me

lets go all the way
(lets go all the way)
lets go all the way
lets go high high high
lets go all the way
lets go all the way
(lets go all the way)
lets go all the way
lets go high high high
lets go all the way</pre>
