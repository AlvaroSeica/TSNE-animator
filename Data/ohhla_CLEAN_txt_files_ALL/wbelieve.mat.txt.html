Typed by: Davida.b., Cno Evil

[Intro: Allah Real]
I wanna believe, you gotta believe (6X)

[Bad Luck]
How could I love a woman I can't trust, I knew from the start
That this here was more than lust
It was like yesterday when we was on that bus
You said I sold your heart the first time I made you blush
Now it's like your girlfriends is the voice of your conscience
And that's the main reason why I'm thinking it's nonsense
But for now, situation's under the carpet
Let's keep it real, ma, I'mma love you regardless, let's go

[Allah Real]
The other day,  when I went outside I realized
You drive me crazy, got me thinking, another guy?
I've never been focused, but these feelings I have inside
The way I feel, I just wanna run and hide

[Chorus 2X: Allah Real]
I wanna believe, knowing what's right from wrong
I wanna believe, baby, what is going on?

[Allah Real]
This thing will past, cuz the love that burns inside
Now I understand, girl, I'm just an average guy
True love to be, that is worth me fighting for
I'm telling you, girl, I'm so in love with you

[Chorus 2X]

[Hook 2X: Allah Real]
You, don't, know, what, I've, been through
All, my, thoughts spent --- on you

[Allah Real]
True love to be, that is worth me fighting for
I'm telling you, girl, I'm so in love with you

[Chorus + Hook to end]</pre>
