[Intro: The Reverend William Burk]
Yes, yes
Harmonious, melodious tracks to drop knowledge on
"Perfection is a road, not a destination" by Burk Hudson
Pay attention

Yeah, comin through, comin through
It's B-U-R-K, all day, every day, ah, check it
About to drop some science, the science of life
Comin through, one time, yo
One time, check it out, yo

[The Reverend William Burk]
It's the stormy weather storyteller, so light some candles
And gather round the microphone, I tell you 'bout my battles
In all the places that my soul has traveled in existence
Before it landed in this life form during this instance
I seen the Christians battle the Jews during the inquisition
I seen Moses stand by the bush and have his vision
I seen Hitler go on his mission to rule the world
I seen a cracker blow up a church and kill four little girls
I seen the cowboys down to kill off all the Indians
I seen brothers that's innocent serving life sentences
I seen the European commit genocide with weaponry
Then try to justify it with "Manifest Destiny"
I seen slave masters rape African women
And hang 'em from a tree the next day in front of their children
That's only the beginning, the things I seen livin on this earth
In my different forms of life and my different times of birth
I've seen a slave warn his master about a revolt
Then the master made the traitor (?) throat
Thinkin that he get his freedom, but he won't
Cause then the master hung him from a rope and took his last bit of hope
I seen a brother dying from AIDS from stickin needles in his veins
So many I can't even remember names
I seen a Somalian girl starvin, her father was robbin
Stealin fruits outta gardens in order to survive
You would be surprised by the things people do to stay alive
In this cold world it's "Do or die!", look me in the eye
And you can see my soul, it's old, it's been around the globe
And see things unfold, as the stories are told

[Chorus: The Reverend William Burk]
Perfection is a road, not a destination
My soul is old, everytime I live I gettin education
Every different situation forces me to grow
And every different manifestation lets me know that
Perfection is a road, not a destination
My soul is old, everytime I live I gettin education
Every different situation forces me to grow
And every different manifestation lets me know

[The Reverend William Burk]
See, this is temporary, it's a scary thought, but it's very true
And even though they bury you, it doesn't mean your life is through
There's billions of situations that we haven't gotten to
Cause everything's a lesson, livin in harmony
With the universe is heaven, I'm a God
And my home is where my heart is, I find my way regardless
I'm travelin the farthest that I can, I'm not a man with a soul
I'm a soul in a man, I might be here again
Or maybe my reality will be within another galaxy
To raise another family and have a different energy
And live a different destiny, and be the best that I can be
My soul transcends the limits of life in this century
It's kinda deep, but we gotta get beyond
Because I'm talkin about living life in different eons
We won't even be human beings, we'll be manifestations
Of life we never imagine within our wildest dreams
I've seen black Queens turn in to crack fiends
I've seen black Kings working harder than machines
Everyday of their lifes, specifically to survive
Within the system, we gotta make decisions about the way
That we livin and envision something better
We're fallin like a feather instead of stickin together
Durin' the stormy weather, with a long way to go
Because the soul lives forever, the soul lives forever, the soul lives forever
