Verse One: June Marx

I speak carnage, analyze like a physicist
The weak hearted, paralyzed in the wilderness
We seek target, a band of spies in the villages
Overcome whatever brothers living with
Over-standing yet underprivileged
Some are stricken with
Lust and bitterness thus numbing their inner gift
Above the ignorance, the duels on
The cure born and manifesting in pure form
A cruel storm of napalm, subdue pawn
Diffuse the bomb stay calm we bruise and harm
Intrude alarm, the truth will surely unfold
I give you knowledge bypass the security code
They gave them cash now their purity sold,
Change their past and its purely for gold
To make history, but unskilled to be I remain a mystery
Portray vividly, language artillery

Verse Two: Lone Ninja

The largest titan, in armored fighting vehicle
The marxman striking and martyrs die in lethal feud 
Assailing and battering all hail or you'll wail 
In the garrison you frail and you pale in comparison 	
Impaled with the javelin, you wither and die
Bring hell in the dragon's den I'm sinister, sly		
No witness survives, I'm livid I'm swift with 
The knives, can live with your vicious demise		
Equipped with the sai, you fear what's next
I'm quick to decide to pierce your neck		
Words is like cannon balls bursting 
The palace walls the insurgents are standing tall 
Lasers scorch the tanks, rockets pound
Traitors walk the plank, watch em drown			
The best armor is to be out of range
The stealth bomber enters the house of pain</pre>
