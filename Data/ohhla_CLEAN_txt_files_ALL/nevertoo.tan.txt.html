[Donwill]
Whole lotta nothin
Braggin bout it ain't no kinda stuntin
But without much still had you
And that's everything I need to get through
Yo, uhh, YO - no placebo
And when the bad days repo my ego
It's like comin home sippin somethin strong
with my weed rolled (yo) and I don't even smoke
So not havin much never really mattered much
We from the same cloth, matchin is the pattern uhh
Probably get it not even know how to handle it
I'm at the bottom and just want my hands on it
Crabs in a barrel drizzle 'em with drawn butter
Brand new apparel killin 'em in all colors
A van to a pair of shows tourin all summer
A Grammy to shelf, right next to my diploma
Uhh; it ain't shit to me
Because some wins are empty victories
And even though I could use all of those
It's a whole lot of nuttin if I lose my soul so

[Chorus: Nitty Scott, MC] + {Donwill}
Uh oh ohhh! (Heyyy) I give you somethin to see {I see}
Is you fuckin with me? Whatever it be
It never mattered too much to me
{Uh, a bank account with the insane amount}
It never really mattered too much to me
{I take you out to the best steakhouse}
Ha! It never really mattered too much to me
{Travel plans and passport stamps}
Uh - but it never really mattered too much to me
Huh, if it was up to me
We'd be ticka ticka ticka ticka ticka ticka

[Von Pea]
Sense; this here sound like Quik at the Jazzfest
With a zip for your man's vest
I'm around vegan alcoholics - can't call it
We arrive with the lit torches
Kings and queens with the recipes, sang over better beats
Half West Indian, your mans don't pepper see
Never mind who's heckling or doing the Dougie
I'd rather do the Doug Heffernan
Big house, hot wife
I'm the author in the basement; nice~!
I don't be caught up in the makeshift hype
I don't need it all, low dough and the mic
Ain't nuttin in my Sprite but Sprite
Ain't nuttin in my Jamey but Jamey
Maybe one day in a navy Mercedes
But let's talk today, pleeeeease?

[Chorus: Nitty Scott, MC] + {Von Pea}
Uh oh ohhh! (Heyyy) I give you somethin to see {I see!}
Is you fuckin with me? Whatever it be
It never mattered too much to me
{Uh, HD on the big screen}
It never really mattered too much to me
{Floor seats with the Knicks team}
It never really mattered too much to me
{Ha! And the Rolex with no ticking}
It never really mattered too much to me
{Yea yea!} If it was up to me
We'd be ticka ticka ticka ticka ticka ticka

[Nitty Scott, MC]
Uh, yo, yo
I kiss the girl in the mirror soon as I wake up
No make up; time to get out, and get my cake up
It's train fares over Vanity Fair
I ain't got no ride, just the pairs I wear - but
I remember, I remember when
I remember when I met him tryin to hustle up a 10
Ridin on the F train, then he tried to explain
why I gotta be his next main... he said
"Excuse me little cutie, I know you it ain't your duty
But I couldn't help but notice that your breath is kinda fruity
(Word?) We probably buy the same kind of gum, damn that was dumb
But fuck it shorty, tell me where you from!
Cause I ain't even rockin with a wallet full of profit
I never gossip and I promise to be honest
We can be free, pretty lil' emcee"
Took his hand and I said "It's alright with me" you see...

[Chorus: Nitty Scott, MC]
Uh oh ohhh! (Heyyy) I give you somethin to see - I see!
Is you fuckin with me? Whatever it be
It never mattered too much to me
Red bottoms and designer bags
It never really mattered too much to me
V.I.P. in the club on smash
It never really mattered too much to me
Big rocks with the icey swag
Uh - it never really mattered too much to me
If it was up to me
We'd be ticka ticka ticka ticka ticka ticka ehhh

[Outro]
You know what I'm sayin?
Rubber Souls bitches!
Ain't no nation like a DO-nation
Cop the motherfuckin album
Pinky ring not included
Make sure, that you leave the baby seat in the back seat
when I pick it up from the dealership</pre>
