This Supreme tee is kinda dingy
Pass the fuckin puffer nigga stingy with the Usher "Let It Burn"
Skate session with my niggaz
On a cloud, where's my inhaler, I can't even breathe
I don't smoke weed
But I'm on a cloud high enough to give me a nose bleed
Say farewell to the brain cells, neutrons can smell us
My niggaz keep enough green to get a bush jealous
Roll tighty, the joint righty, go buy a label
and busters don't get the zipper in Chris lighty, alrighty
Or maybe a Swisher, I begin to kiss her...
Keepin all the arms and limbs in a large bin
My niggaz keep mary +Jane+ like they're fuckin Tarzan
In the fuckin toilet where my bars been
They been the shit since Riley figured out she really likes fark men
Domo hittin bowls, nuggets size of coals
Rollin a whole 'nother blunt the size of a troll
Davon on parole, so if the highway patrol
sees us trollin to 7-11 to get a Arizona, and some donuts
He'll be in a hole, but we not gonna let it happen
Im not talkin music when I say we're the best at wrappin
The kush, coke, Ritalin, and mushroom caps in my system
Um

[Hodgy Beats]
I break No. 2 pencils cause I write so strong
Tyler rollin up a stick so when it lights, so long
Brass monkey, clarinet, ten drop in the gong
Gas mask, vaporizer, tranquilize you with the bong
I-magine gas and laxing, puff passin past tense
Future kush, cool tour, poke your arms blue or
dream, smoke white like vanilla bean ice cream
Besides O.F., Mary Jane and me make a nice team
Pause, aw, you gettin too fat bitch
Much is gainin is weight is, fuckin automatically
Can't fit into the plus size of that Saks 5th
She get high, get down on hot dogs and pick up the cat bitch
The powder is packed in the straw, Sammy claim he like chowder
Nostrils are allowed, to scream white power
Overdose in a quince then detox, she rocks
Got 'em sweatin like the inhalier on she-cops
And we the drug, and we the drug, and we the drug
Bitch I'm high as fuck
Just let it sing to you

[Domo Genesis]
I stay in the sky so there's no way you can get fly as me
Niggaz wish that some point in their life they will get high as me
Never though, got 'em goin through the roof with hella smoke
with towels under the door hopin no one outside smell the 'dro
Fuck it, I'm blazin up, bad bitch cravin dust
So I passed it to her with last in juicy before wakin up
Strong dank leave your main bitches with throat aches
One of 'em half bakin, half dressed cause her clothes stink
Rollin paper skills, it's the time I showcase
So bust down, bitches want a star beat like old vapers
Where Divon at? Cause he can Zaire too
Big Cam blowin, you can even call Lionel
Tyler dog, hit it once for the game
Give it to Hodgy Beats then dish it off to the Brain
My eyes heavy - someone give me a orange juice
Louis V shades so my thoughts don't support you
Thoughts decreases, Hungry bowls on my torso
Paper plate or paper plane, can I please aboard you
You, you
Aiyyo Von, light that one

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Kush
Coke
X
Mushroom
I'm high as fuck

[Tyler, the Creator]
I'm atheist, so I let the blunt bless her
Higher than a fat nigger bitch blood pressure
On the dresser is the kush compressor
That's four scents of bags with fluorescent flower petals
Take a hit of this shit, invitin some
Bitches over to the crib, take a sniff, feelin numb
Baby girl, this is love, mixed with coke
And the eighty proof is in the pudding (so is a pint of cum)
This is fun, don't you even try to run
Get you high, get you drunk, oh wait, you're not even real
This is fake, snow white is in my nasal
I don't even think I'm able, the shimmy passed the table
without trippin on cables, me and Travis cryin
Earl is probably dyin, Cedric lickin walls
And all of us trippin balls, heart beating in a trance
I'm in a submissive stance, I'm not fuckin playing
when I say call the ambulance... shit

[Outro]
Call the fuckin ambulance
I can't feel me, call the.. I can't fuckin breathe
I'm not fucking.. this isn't..
What the fuck is this he..
Yo call the ambulance, my heart is beatin too fast
I'm bout to.. open a fuckin window {*fades out*} </pre>
