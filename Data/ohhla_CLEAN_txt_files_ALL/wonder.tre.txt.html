SONGZ

[Trey Songz]
Ya face is amazing blazing hot like cajun
All I need is a minute
Please no gimmicks
You tellin me to chill on the real or take a trip to satin
Send me to hell with it then I yell what it do
To hell with ya crew
Say ya got a man well to hell with him to
The seats is sea shell the whip is sea blue and you can swim through
Aint a lot of women that I can't swim through
And you can't say that I don't temp you
If you said that yous a liar
grip them legs back call me pliars
2 4 chrome up under the tires
And you so grown
And my desires to make you cum
so finish that
aye who said Trey Songz ain't fire

[Hook]
The way you talkin' girl you seem so invincible

[Trey Songz]
It's a shame the way you do ya thang
You can't blame me starin' at ya frame
