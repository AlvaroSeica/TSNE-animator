(*talking*)
Introduction is definitely not needed right now, ha-ha
You know who you rocking with, g'eah g'eah
Let ya know, it's going down

[Hook]
You don't want no problems, with me
Bitch I told ya, I'm a Southside G
And it's kinda hard, when you living like a soldier
Don't ask me shit about that bitch from the Clover, it's over

[E.S.G.]
You don't want no problems, with me
I was taught to shoot, 'fore a nigga shoot me
Steady repping S.U.C. and SES, we making mail
My homie switched teams, he now riding with Pharrell what the hell
You don't want no problems, with me
Hit you with that AK, or 2-23 feel me G
I'm like a soldier in Felusha, with one bullet left
Her's what P-A say you fuck with us, it's bad for your health
Serve hollow tips like a chef, you ever felt one befo'
Now there's a legend in your presence, you ever smelt one befo'
Don't make me smash your ass I don't give a fuck, stab ya ass like my name Young Buck
This ain't the matrix this real life, fuck wtih us and you won't get up
Notorious like B.I., king of the South like T.I.
Keep ice in the mouth cause we fly, y'all sweet as my Auntie peach pie
Say dog, you know what really make a nigga sick
When a nigga can't get his own, he riding another nigga dick
Cause it's my click and we super thick, spit these chips get super rich
Chick named Chelsea Ray want me to play, Lord she suck a super dick
You's a trick then you's a trick, mentally I'll use a bitch
See pimping in my veins ain't nothing changed, still swang and bang to this gangsta shit

[Hook]

[E.S.G.]
Heard a little talk, in the streets
Niggaz thinking they can fuck with E.S.G., not me
See yup Southside of town I represent, hold it down like a president
Looking down I'm heaven sent, you talking down that's irrelevent
Can't hate on my click we making mail, signing new contracts like Dave Chappelle
Independent still raising hell, bitch ass niggaz y'all pay for sales
SES we spraying K's, ghetto marines and green barrets
Navy Seals with ice on the grill, mind on a mill homie everyday
Y'all quick to forget where y'all came from, once that fucking fame come
Wait till the fucking pain come, you gon wish you could go change huh
Stay strapped up we G's in action, knock out orders like Stephen Jackson
David Stern can't take what I earned, I'm the Boss yup the team co-captain
Me and Big Sin we gon get them ends, me and Big Jet we gon do it again
Tell that DJ screw it again, tell that bitch she could chew it again
Nigga be friends then nigga be foes, switch on you just like hoes
That's alright we gon get this do', c.d.'s DVD's mixtapes and shows

[Hook]

You don't want no problems, with me
