Yeah, yeah

[Chorus One: Khujo Goodie, Big Boi]
[K.G.] She said her name was Tangerine, damn the American dream
She all about her fuckin cream, so shake it like a tambourine
Shake it like a tambourine - she shake it like a tambourine?
Shake it like a tambourine - she shake it like a tambourine
[B.B.] She said her was Billie Jean, said she wanna show me things
I pulled out a stack of green, shake it like a tambourine
Shake it like a tambourine - shake it like a tambourine
Shake it like a tambourine - shake it like a tambourine

[Big Boi]
Now, let's set it straight, B-I-G don't cuff or cake
I, put her on a plate until she's no longer awake
They just lay, fast asleep, when I hit 'em with the snake
Put that venom up in 'em until I leave 'em with the shakes
On display, she's a model but she only model shoes
Not fake like a prosthetic leg or prostitute
How she choose? She just whispers in my ear ("I'm with you")
I'm the type of dude that sends your baby mama out for food
And I also like her throat action, with a passion
Love in her mou-outh, for dental satisfaction
That means I hit the head like Greg Louganis then I'm splashin
Ughhh, bust one back of the 'llac, stabbin (hootie hoo!)
She know what's happenin, there's no reason to doubt it
If you ask her how I got it she say ("How he had went about it was")
And then you wake up from a bad dream, a nightmare
Settle down cause she right there

[Chorus One]

[T.I.]
Okay, midnight, fit like, four or five chicks
in the drop '66 bumpin "Southernplayalistic"
as we ridin through the city lights, Monday Magic City night
Pass these around, momentarily they feelin like
gettin right, good girls, got 'em gettin busy like
big dykes, eatin so much pussy they forget pipe
All got boyfriends, tell me they don't hit it right
They come see me so they can come be freaks
in the back seat, everything's fast like a track meet
All I can see is titties, pussy lips and ass cheeks
Actually, no exaggeration, no imaginin
Real talk, my reality is yo' fantasy
Keisha, Kim, Tamika, Shay, Alicia and Gloria
Chasin this broad tryin to find euphoria
Name notorious, dick game glorious
Find me shawty when ya boyfriend borin ya

[Chorus Two: Big Boi, Khujo Goodie]
[B.B.] Shake it like some Texas Pete droppin on your collard greens
Make it hotter when she want a dollar, do you follow me?
Shake it like a tambourine - shake it like a tambourine
Shake it like a tambourine - shake it like a tambourine
[K.G.] Smellin like some tangerines, rollin like she on some beans
Garter belt full of greens, booty bustin out the seams
Shake it like a tambourine - she shake it like a tambourine
Shake it like a tambourine - watch her shake it like a tambourine

[Big Boi]
Once upon a rhyme I knew this girl and she was fine
as everything outdo's, the kind of girl I describe her like-like-like
Michael Jordan when he's froze in a pose of a Jumpman
Top flight security on these hoes man
She drop it low only for me to pick her up
When she's liquored up I'm leavin my fingerprints on her butt
A ten-hut, at attention as we stand for this woman
General Patton, boy stop, we think she cummin
Lovin the way that I'm dickin her down, Boi you bluffin
Nothin but a nigga like me be straight up royal flushin
But this ain't 'bout playin no cards dummy
Her give me open mouth sugar and she go hard for me
Even take a charge for me, if the coppers caught us ridin
to get a tray of fruit, and a pack of 1-point-5's and
I'm all the way on them papers, she all the way on my team
We burn it down like California trees in the breeze
Fire!

[Chorus One]

[Outro]
Shake shake it, shake shake it, shake shake it, shake shake it
Shake shake it, shake shake that ass
Shake shake it, shake shake it, shake shake it, shake shake it
Shake shake it, shake shake that, shake that
Work, work, work, work, work, work, work, work (and all my ladies go to)
Work, work, work, work, work, work, work, work (shake shake it, shake that ass)</pre>
