[The Jet Age of Tomorrow]
This is my duty, to all mankind
And I know, I won't regret this
So I go - I know your parents, aren't home now
and you don't know, I'm outside waiting
{*laughing*} I creep into your window
You still don't hear a thing though
I wonder if you even hear
But I know you're prepared to meet your biggest fear, he he

[Chorus]
I know where you are
This is the night, that you die
For what I've been through
You will pay, for the lies

[The Jet Age of Tomorrow]
I heard, you were here
So I walk, upstairs
Then I hear your voice
Then I see you, styling your hair
I begin to creep in
You don't even, hear a noise
I get in position
and my plans, begin to deploy, hah hah ha~!

[Chorus]

[The Jet Age of Tomorrow]
As I start, to move forward
You then, see me
So startled you begin to run
To get away from me
As you try to escape
I catch you at the door
I been took action
Now your lies, are no more

[Chorus] - 2X

[The Jet Age of Tomorrow]
It's just all a joke {*3X*}
Or is it?
It's just all a joke {*3X*}
Trust me - or is it?
I'm just playing {*3X*}
Or am I?
I'm just playing {*2X*}
... Or am I?</pre>
