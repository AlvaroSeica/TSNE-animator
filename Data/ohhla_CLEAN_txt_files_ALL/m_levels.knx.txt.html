[Intro: Bumpy Knuckles]
You always gonna have people who don't believe, that you really good at what you do
You know, and that's probably more so because they haven't figured out 
How to good at what they know, or don't even know how to do it you know
So, you know that;s what it is, you know
Every level you reach you gonna come against obstacles 
And you have to combat those obstacles in order to move forward
It's almost like your playin a video game you know what I mean 
And...the prize is, your sanity......................word!

[Bumpy Knuckles] (DJ Premier Scratchin)
Ha!!! (C-C-Come on wit it-"Masta Ace")
SHHHH!!! (C-C-C-C-C-C-C-Come on-C-C-Come on with it-"Masta Ace")

(Me and you, gettin it on, don't even go there-"Panchi")
(Come on-o-o-o-o-Come on with it-"Masta Ace")
(Once I bring it to you, you won't be safe nowhere-"Panchi")

[Verse One: Bumpy Knuckles]
More levels, more devils, diesel
Airin out the stage like a Nievel, Brother
Leave you, die on your face
For no good reason at all we in a bad place
Ha! Hip Hop is separated, by the nice and the nice not
Underground and I'm ice hot
What rap nigga my age still keep the mic hot, ha ha!
Couple hip hop Butterbeans
Big sluggers move with me it's a gutter team
I love women who love hardcore who know the boom from the bap
O.G.'s could still fill a room when he rap 
Mic blessin in a recession is food givin back
To occupy labels that moved it in wax
Now, here come Bumpy on a Premo track
To represent Hip Hop from where we go back
Ha Ha! Crack!

[Chorus: DJ Premier Scratchin]:
C-C-C-C-Come on with it-"Masta Ace"
M-M-M-Me and you, gettin it on, don't even go there-"Panchi"
C-C-C-C-C-C-Come on with it-"Masta Ace"
Cause you know what we got to do-"Jeru Da Damaja"
Come on-o-o-on-Come on with it-"Masta Ace"
M-M-M-Me and you, gettin it on, don't even go there-"Panchi"
C-C-C-C-C-C-Come on with it-"Masta Ace"
O-O-O-Once I bring it to you, you won't be safe nowhere-"Panchi"

[Verse Two: Bumpy Knuckles]
I let the beat keep breathin, while I spit life to you heathens
You in the wrong place, to be real
Reasons, I usually don't corny styles lile that 'cause I'm too seasoned
How you ballin, sendin links tryin to get on you stink
MC's don't give a fuck what you think
Fuck rappin if it's beef I hit up brinks
And put that kind of paper on your head to make alot of killers link 
Now think....wouldn't you rather keep it music 
Then to lose it all 'cause of music
I'm sure that's now how Bambaataa wanted us to use it
Now move it before I lose it
And I'm in it for the long haul, bars
Like lifers in alarm halls, bond
My life rockin mics I raise the bar
Phased 'em, dazed 'em and blazed 'em all
SCORNED!!!

[Chorus: DJ Premier Scratchin]:
C-C-C-C-Come on with it-"Masta Ace"
M-M-M-Me and you, gettin it on, don't even go there-"Panchi"
C-C-C-C-C-C-Come on with it-"Masta Ace"
C-C-Cause you know what we got to do-"Jeru Da Damaja"
C-C-C-C-Come on with it-"Masta Ace"
M-M-M-Me and you, gettin it on, don't even go there-"Panchi"
C-C-C-C-C-C-Come on with it-"Masta Ace"
O-O-O-Once I bring it to you, you won't be safe nowhere-"Panchi"

[Verse Three: Bumpy Knuckles]
Real nigga cinema, the future's a top feature
Who's favorite MC, is The Bronx teacher
Flow's long around hooks so the words reach ya
Joe Jackson on you Michael ass niggas beat ya
Now "Beat It" before I pull this Tito, and shoot you in your ego
It's front page news read it
My style is to Barker over beats
Like Travis I'll bark 'em, GRRRR spark 'em
Overwritten flows and shit
Like overflowin toilet bowls and shit, the game is a mess
Beef ain't really over with
The only way for me to get over it, is to aim at your chest
I rock with a DJ, who sets the tone
Plugs in two twelves, and a microphone
And I don't stop rockin the beats and keep rockin
As long as the streets are heat then keep coppin
POPPIN!!!

[Chorus: DJ Premier Scratchin]
C-C-Come on with it-"Masta Ace"
M-M-M-Me and you, gettin it on, don't even go there-"Panchi"
C-C-C-C-C-C-Come on with it-"Masta Ace"
C-C-Cause you know what we got to do-"Jeru Da Damaja"
C-Come-C-C-Come on with it-"Masta Ace"
M-M-M-Me and you, gettin it on, don't even go there-"Panchi"
Come on-o-o-o-Come on with it-"Masta Ace"
Once-Once-O-Once I bring it to you, you won't be safe nowhere-"Panchi"
