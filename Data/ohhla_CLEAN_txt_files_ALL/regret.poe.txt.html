[Intro: "Goodfellas" - Henry Hill]
For most of the guys, killings got to be accepted
Murder was the only way that everybody stayed in line
You got out of line, you got whacked, everybody knew the rules
But sometimes even if people didn't get out of line they got whacked
I mean hits just became a habit for some of the guys
Guys would get into arguments over nothing
and before you knew it one of them was dead
And they were shooting each other all the time
Shooting people was a normal thing, no big deal

[Poetic Death]
Yo, yo
Black chucks illuminated through the darkness
The scarecrow is hanging off the tree branch; he wonders where his heart went
Cause just the other day he was reflecting off the memory
And just the other day, he was tripping off the imagery
So never get it twisted, artists live a life of sorrow
It motivates the poetry, it makes the pain harder
And time is just a burden that I've learned to live without so
if happiness is waiting tell her love is just a hassle
I used to water rose petals just to watch the day go
Until the sun died and now I've learned to live without those
cause beauty in the afterlife is something that I wonder
And when my mother passes will I ever get to hug her?
I wonder

[Interlude: "Goodfellas" - Henry Hill]
As far back as I can remember I always wanted to be a gangster

[Poetic Death]
Yo, yo
Let me give you a fair warning because the time I have is limited
And if I die tomorrow use my music as my sedative
And yo, at night time I daze into the skyline
and conversations in the moonlight for those who hate light
What happened to the scarecrow is a mystery to many
It's a shame he had to end his life or felt that it was necessary
And I spoke to The Raven out of worry
I was more or less concerned about the burden that he carried
And I wondered if Malcolm, would be relatively similar
His life would be a trip without support from those who need ya
I was told to overcome, I had to build my own foundation
That could outstand even the toughest of situations
It would overstand religion and defy the laws of happiness
I traded in my soul, for a second chance at life
But now I wonder if my memory, is something that despises me
I've never heard an angel say that God would trade his life for me
Regret

[Outro: "Goodfellas" - Henry Hill]
For most of the guys, killings got to be accepted
Murder was the only way that everybody stayed in line
You got out of line, you got whacked, everybody knew the rules
But sometimes even if people didn't get out of line they got whacked
I mean hits just became a habit for some of the guys
Guys would get into arguments over nothing
and before you knew it one of them was dead
And they were shooting each other all the time
Shooting people was a normal thing, no big deal</pre>
