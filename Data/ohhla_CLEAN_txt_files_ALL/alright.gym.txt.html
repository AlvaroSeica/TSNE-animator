[Intro/Chorus One]
We are young, we run free
Stay up late, we don't sleep
Got our friends, got the night
We'll be alright

(Let's go~!)

[Travie McCoy]
Tonight you won't be by yourself-self
Just leave your problems on the shelf-shelf
You won't wanna be nowhere else-else
So let's go, so let's go
We got the club like (whoooooo)
And all the girls sayin (whoooooo)
The hole world sayin (whoooooo)
Yeah, yeah, c'mon let's get drunk, toast it up
We don't give a fuck

[Chorus One]

[Chorus Two]
Throw our hands, in the air
Pretty girls, everywhere
Got our friends, got the night
We'll be alright

[Interlude]
(Whoooooo) Alright alright alright
(Whoooooo) Ah ah ah ah
(Whoooooo) Alright alright alright
(Whoooooo) Ah ah ah ah

[Travie McCoy]
We walk the streets like we don't care-care
Our middle fingers in the air-air
So come and join us we'll be there-there
Yeah let's go, yeah let's go
We got the club like (whoooooo)
And all the girls sayin (whoooooo)
The hole world sayin (whoooooo)
Yeah, yeah, c'mon let's get drunk, toast it up
We don't give a fuck

[Chorus One] + [Chorus Two]

[Travie McCoy: repeat 2X]
It feels like aaaaaaahhh
(It feels good don't it?)
Aaaaaah (Just just just, just do it)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah (yeah!) Uh-huh

[Chorus One] + [Chorus Two]</pre>
