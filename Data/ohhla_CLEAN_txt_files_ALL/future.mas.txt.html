Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Borderline cases
Reinforced glass
Absent friends
Passport photos
An elastic past
Empty pocket
They think it is all...
They think it's soul
All wrapped up on a swollen lip
He draws the warm pipe.

Chemicals
Chemicals captured in winter's grip
Turn us on

Seperate the leper
Hungry ghosts
Hungry ghosts
Another imprint
In borrowed clothes
We can be numb
We can be numb
Passing through

Blow blow blow blow

Borderline case
Future proof
Real thin air
Real thin air
Real thin air</pre>
