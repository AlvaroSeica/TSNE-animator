[Frank Ocean]
I got a question, I wanna ask my momma
but she's been gone for some years now
I need the answers, I want to ask my friends
but they're to cool to be honest
And she's gon' take it the wrong way if I question her
It just might break her heart man
I can't ask my girl

[Chorus]
So I'm gonna ask Lennon
And I'ma ask Donnie
And I'ma ask Stevie
And I'ma ask Prince if I'm in love, if I'm in love
My headphones won't lie if I'm in love
Tell me tell me, if I'm in love
My headphones won't lie if I'm in love
Tell me tell me, am I in love?

[Frank Ocean]
Who the hell, knows who +Purple Rain+ is?
and am I standing in it?
I sing along, to every single word though
and I feel like I need them
Cause for all I know
"Rocket Love" flew past me yesterday
But I gotta know for sure

[Chorus]
