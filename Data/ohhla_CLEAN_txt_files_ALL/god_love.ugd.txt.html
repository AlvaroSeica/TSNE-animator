[Intro: Cappadonna]
Stay ya'll, atonement, this one is for you, yessir, aiyo

[Cappadonna]
Aiyo, I grab flows and throw 'em wit a twist of the wrist
I throw one inside your house like a Christmas gift
I'm the reason why these MC's be changing they flow
Cuz everytime I spit mine, they can't get no dough
Now ya'll rappers pay attention, ya'll don't know what it is
You just tearing the blocks down and shooting at kids
You not a thug to me now, and yeah, I know your type
You just wild to ya self, you not wild in the club
You wit your boys all the time, like a homo thug
You ain't never wit the honeys, you don't get no love
You make music for these assholes that be on the block
I make music for the world, just to bring up my stock
Come on ya'll, ya'll don't really know what it do
I drop jewels in your head like it's Purell shampoo
Martin Luther King &amp; Malcolm X, Don' and Baby U
Spit the gospel in our rap, take brothers to church
Ya'll taught 'em to sell crack, but we show 'em they worth
Wu-Tang music, this is how it suppose to sound
Ya'll keep picking up the hood, while you putting us down
God is is love, come on, ya'll

[Chorus: Cappadonna]
Come on, God is love, everybody say God is love
Come on, ya'll say God is love
God is love, love, God is love, love

[U-God]
Gotta change my ways, my mother warned me
Calmly'll speak, time to air my dirty laundry
Angels that guard my body, lord, I'm sorry
Lord, I'm sorry for the things I did
It's strange out here, we bang out here
Killas, drug dealers, they hang out there
Cold stares, we don't care, we braid our hair
Lord, they hate out there, and there's jakes out where
Got plan to escape, they fake out here
Yea, they snakes out here, full of lies and deceit
Yea, they take out here, son died on his feet
Son cried in his sleep, can't forget his past
He lost a glass ring, just to flip some cash
He cried on the visit, his daughter kissed the glass
I need your blessings, but I missed the mass
I changed my ways, gotta shift the math
I picked my path, my wrongs is right
I used to hustle to the morning light
Then I found out, son, that there's more to life
They focused, indeed, my songs is tight
And survival of the fittest, with all my might
Got my legs and my brain, and all my sight
No more grief, and my teeth is white
And I never give up, and I keep the light

[Chorus 2X]

[Killah Priest]
Hurses past us, demos, cast in stained glass windows
Pubes, pools of baptism, views of black victims
I snooze, catch visions of a beautiful world
No funerals, God musical, unusual pearls
Then, after it's judgement, then after the blood rips
Off of body and soul, we like Marcus Garvey in the godliest robes
And I awake from the sound of organs
The sound of families mourning, fallen grabbing his coffin
Will he fall or carried by the Lord wings
Absorbed in all the evil, that we do as the youth
So we, teach 'em the truth, you, teach 'em to shoot
Eve, ate out my fruit, then she, ate at my loot
Now we, pitch on the stoupe, til we rich in the coupe
Then someone snitch, you're found stiff in your boots
You need lessons, brothers, while I predicted the booth
Proverbs is truth, so who you listening to?

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
