Song:   I'm Shittin' On 'Em
Typed by: ftomi@denho.pmmf.hu

I can do the somber
Like in November
Then rock a crowd while I'm in my pajamas
Like Tito Puente
I am muy caliente
Fuck Kunta Kinte
Cuz Son is the sensei
I funk with the black belt
You better step back, hell
I can Get Smart
Just like Agent Maxwell
I don't give a fuck, G
Hey hey, we're the Monkees
I'll rock a rhyme to the end of the month, see
I go on and on
Like a marathon
I sing like Sarah Vaughn
But like the underground
I flip through some kung-fu
You know that I've come to
Freak the ill shit
You just can't undo

Chorus:
Son, get it funky  (I'm shittin' on 'em, shittin' on 'em) (4x)
Son, get it funky  (yo, I'm shittin' on 'em)
I can get symphonic
Like Harry Connick
Or the Philharmonic
I'll drop atomic
Vocals, solo
Like Sonny Bono
I got you babe... but who's got the pornos?
I'm iller than a wino
I'm not an albino
I charge like a rhino
You put me in a ???
When I rob shit, bomb shit
Some say I'm obnoxious
I don't give a fuck
I'll make you feel nauseous
Row, row your boat
Gently down the street
I'll take you all out 
With my funk doobie team
I got the skills, kid 
Like Rumplestilskin
I put out gold, get smooth like Jackie Wilson
Singin' soprano
Move to the piano
Hey, where's the ???
Our shit will be in ???

Chorus (4x

I shoobee-do-pop
Hip hop like Sinatra
I spray my Binaca
Then shake my maracas
Hey, it's the swinga
Fuck a humdinger with a finger
Yo, it's the ultimate singer
Kumbaya, yo kumbaya
Like Belafonte
But what's Del Monte?
I kicks the flava
The ill funk behavior
Sick like polio
Wild like a rodeo
Out there in Kansas
Punk, check the classic
Get your ass kicked
So hop in the casket
I'm rockin calipso
Who's got the Nabisco
I cook like Crisco
I pump the ill disco

Chorus (8x)</pre>
