Typed by: DaSun Akbar

(Intro) Daddy Rose
Yeah, got you on the mail
King Solomon 88 ki's
Black Rose Kartel dawg

*Daddy Rose is talking throughout the whole song

(Chorus) Elohim X2
When it reigns and it pours
Clowns get showered in blood
In the storm of the Rose will get divined by thugs
Rose World Order lames get showered in slugs
When push comes to shove, get touched with rugs

[Elohim]
Peep the god in the drop cheddar
Dice game stopping cheddar
Fuck storms son my gun gave the weather
Full pound blazed for 44 days and nights
Know the name, Lethal 44 days and nights
Shoot the .4/5, .38 or the MAC-10s
Scrams bend me right for a paper and a pen
Looking at his watch glistening in an all black Benz
I just creep up on the drop and throw the gat to his limbs
Look I'm ABG, for the triple 0's in the year 2G
Feeling like Christ the way they hating the King
Hating our aim, it's just blasphemy
Spit like a hurricane, when I crash the P
Think I'll fall like Samson 'cause I go to war like Samson
Ride my gun up with the planets
Spit Mercury the A-P and the hot ones melt
Then throw the .9 Ruger bitch on the Ashtray Belt
'Cause I bang with Ds and killers, my niggas' intangible
Hundred hour break, its Brownsville made animals
ATF examining me, wonder who I be, it's 88 ki's bitch
To die heat or fire heat

(Chorus) Elohim

[Goldie Mack]
Yeah, I'm on some new shit like James Bond on some clue shit
Like Nikki Bonds y'all better cool it
Or get fooled fools, y'all niggas is clueless
Trying to study my G-funk, it's drunken monkey
I b-boy stance, y'all need the knowledge with me
Understand, even though y'all can't understand
My wisdom and knowledge, I single hand, single handily
Its bravery, not crazy, I only hang, bang, with Bs
No Cs in my beehive, I'd rather sign with three guys
Desert, AK, my A-K-A is G-2-K, the Headless Horsemen
Four-Horsemen running wild extorting like I'm BO from Courtland
My leaning lesson, leaning rights called me
GU-G1 'cause I pawned the God-U
And I never lost son, skillet, I'm the boss
So whatchu talking about Willis?
You better stay in your place
'Fore you get sprayed in your face
You're talking with your Face/Off like the movie
I make a movie, it's awesome, we're groovy
Somewhere with a Jacuzzi, so I could Bob Cousy
So I could shirt my abuli, muli
I got the tuli lami for Guiliani
Yapping at crueliani, Illuminati

(Chorus) Elohim

[King Solomon Rose]
Yo, King Solomon global chrome Allah head is
Bonafide spit is, play my throne in the black reign
It ain't a game dolcha, where your motor, black scarfs follow
Cut your top off like 'Sleepy Hollow'
Straight gangsta, raspberry snubs listen here cuz
You play thug, we play catch a slug
I throw up ABG to the FEDS snapping pictures
'Fifth Element' we're flying the sixes
Swarming us, BR bitches, FDB
Y'all don't understand a principle of ABG
We get our back on, fuck you think with all black on
'Til I'm five feet deep, I'm repping the Rose
Wetting the foes, repping in shows, weapons of gold
Millennium clones, dresses in codes, always maintain
Gleaming like I'm dipped in platinum reign
Throw hate on the Rose, hate on your hoes
We don't sing, we just bling
Trying to blow your gun at the King
I slaughter dunn, you're spitting with a water gun
Get my K-tone's from Rome, what you know about SNG in the stone?
2G it's on, how you moving when you're wrapped in thorns

(Chorus) Elohim X2

(Outro) Daddy Rose
Black Rose Kartel, ABG forever, you heard?
Black P forever, doing this need mothafucka
All those who don't make it, gotta deal with it
Choose not to deal with it? Uh y'all could suck our dick
Personally, yours truly, Daddy Rose, the widow son
Alright dawgs we outta this mothafucka, fuck 'em all</pre>
