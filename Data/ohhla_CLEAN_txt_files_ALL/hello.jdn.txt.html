Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Huh Hello (hello)
Eh hello (hello)
How you doing there? Hello (hello)
Like hello (hello)

Like hello
My name is Jaden and I am a young fellow
I like to keep it mellow, I like to make friends and make trends a tender
Young school Dances, young romances girl
This is your chances, it's a long shot
Should be tryin' to hit you both but it's a long shot
Because I'm tryin to rock the mic and no won't bone stop
I'm a keep rappin' 'bout this love until this song stop
Cause we're just young and dumb and numb and lung capacity flung from me in the last city
Hun, you one of the last pretty girls that ain't cash greedy, models that's mad skinny
You was that bad picky
Girl, it's a vegetarian
Who hated the movies and loved to go to aquariums
And she was just stare and bearly feeling embarrassed
She put the mannequin careless who ran with lot of Paris like

Hello
Huh Man, Hello
Um, Hello
Hi, hello
Hello

Greetings this evening
Hi, my name is Jaden
These girls are just so deceiving
They see me, they don't believe em
Minor, well
I don't have any gold and all the records are sold
They thinkin' I'm really old but...
No, I'm a teen, I'm still keeping it clean
I'm having meetings with deans, you see me up on the screen like
Hello, I'm doing this scene
A mean fighting machine
And still keeping it lean like woa
What does this mean? I'm seeing all these faces
My sister just got her braces
My misfits is breaking bases
It's crazy
My cushions top of he notches
Fans always tryna wave so moises is getting noxious
We at the shows, tryna make a mosh pit
Living life so exotic, I'm not tryna be obnoxious
And we tryna paint so now we go into josh's
Now we tryna go skate, we strappin' on all the costumes like

Hello
Huh Man, Hello
Um, Hello
Uh man, hello
Hello

They say it's eatin your vocals, it's so cool
Shuttin juckas down as soon as he click Rolls through
Man, we bringing back the old school
If I could, I'd do this without pro tools
Huh, but this is just a intro
Listen up homie if you want some info
I got some details
Sellin jockers out like they was some retails
Couple taxes and emails
Talkin' all about females
Hope that doesn't concern you
When they come up in battle
Well homie, I'm a just burn you
But you gon learn to respect it
You want a real emcee then check this done misfuss...</pre>
