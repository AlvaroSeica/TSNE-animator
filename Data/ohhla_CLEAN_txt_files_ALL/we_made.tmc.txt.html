Verse 1:  (Down) 
See we done made it 
No need to hate it, congratulate it 
Blowin' up with 263 cause' T-Mac he can't be faded 
Praise it, then elevated, don't underestimated 
Like your thirst obey it, in the game but never playa-hate it 
I had strugglin' times the mils stayed on my mind 
On the low stay on the grind 
Cause' I gots to get mine 
We concentrated on having this industry dominated 
We goin' to Nashville in that custom made Navigator 
It's gettin' hectic let's sell these tapes, C.d.'s and records 
We gotta' be first, can't imagine comin' in second 
You aggravated, cause' the dope still over-weighted 
You contemplated on your own life so take it 
Fuck with milk, got cheese 
It's 98 get cha' lazy ass up cause' these niggas holdin' g's 
We motivated hating hearing tolerated 
Who's the richest No Limit or 263? 
Don't even debated, we demonstrated 
Lets roll another one and blaze it 
Keep us figures calculated and leave dem bustas in amazement 
We made it 
Ah-ha  know what I'm sayin' 

(Chorus)  (Suave) 
(Damn it feels good to be rich and in this industry 
All my life I been hustlin', all my life I been strugglin' 
Damn it feels good to be rich and in this industry 
All my life I been slangin', All my life I been bangin') 

Verse 2:       (Mega-Bucks) 
Man dem' haters can't stand to see me livin' this life 
Marble floor, major hoes, a nigga covered in ice 
Jumpin' out that Navigator with that Alpine bangin' 
Nigga came a long way from all that hangin' and slangin' 
Now we million dollar playas regulatin' that cheese 
A hundred-thousand for that hummer, man I cop it with ease 
Ain't no thang ha, thats when a nigga sittin' on banks 
Swiss accounts stashed away, in case dem' feds wanna strike 
Man livin' this life done seen many niggas do 
Dem' made niggas, paid niggas that I'm callin' my crew 
T-Mac saw a nigga sittin' out on his luck 
Hit me with a couple' ki's, now I'm sittin' on bucks 
Then we took this dope-game to a whole notha' level 
Rap-hustle with the muscle keep dem' diamonds embezzled 
You haters keep hatin', I'mma put on my shine 
Brothers always makin' dollars thats the bottom line 

Chorus 

Verse 3:   (T-Mac) 
Nigga, picture me slangin' down-south Charlyo, nigga thug-bangin' 
But like windin' that Rolex 
Thats why I got dem' broads in the ghetto, 
relieve some of this ghetto stress 
And nigga I done made it to the top 
And never stop carryin' my Glock, thats why i keep my shit cock 
And now I got ends 
I always had the Rolex, houses by the lake and the Benz 
And all these niggas hatin' on me 
Callin' my name tryin' to link me to conspiracy 
But money can't change me 
I always had money in the beginnin' so it ain't strange to me 
So niggas keep your head up 
And watch out for dem' niggas tryin' to put y'all in that black truck 
(Yeah, y'all niggas betta watch out for dem' niggas tryin' to put chall' in that black truck, this shit is for real)
