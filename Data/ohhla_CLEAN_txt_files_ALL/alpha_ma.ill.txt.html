[Verse 1]
Honey, I'm home! Where's my dinner? And this place is a mess
And less than adequate, marked with laziness and soap-opera watching
Clean it top to bottom now or face the consequences
Stop that sentence, I don't really want to hear your feedback
Smack the taste out of your loud mouth now
Sweetheart, the game is on and you just fouled out
How about a little affection thrown in my direction honey?
Yeah, I'm sorry for the way I yelled about the money that I lost
Gambling last night, but you must be on the crack pipe
If you think I'ma let a woman take that tone with me
And I know they cut the phone, see? But I wasn't trying to hear it
I didn't mean to break your face, I just wanted to break your spirit
And your arm the night before, I thought we agreed that was an accident
Now the neighbors called the cops on some old assault and battering
And I'm a man of my word and all my words got 4-Letters
The door is that way, but you'll never do any better than me
This is my house, I'm the man, I rule with the hand of fear
You don't like it? Get out! Now go get me another beer
Did I make myself clear? Don't make me say it twice
I worked a double shift last night and don't got time to play it nice
As for the lipstick on my collar, well that's my business
You're my wife and all that, but let's face it. You got your limits
You're dependent on this bread winner 'cause you're barefoot and pregnant
I'm a part of your life til I decide to make my exit...

[Hook 1]
He's the alpha, the top of the pile, the leader of the pack
You'll listen when he talks because he's got it like that
Matter fact he rules with iron fist, gripping misfortune
He learned to be a man from his father before him
Yeah, he's the alpha, the first person in every universe
Version 5.0 pack animal with blood thirst and stamina
The root of family trees where so many have fallen
He'll provide for your needs, but please proceed with caution
The Alpha...

[Verse 2]
Now I was called long ago to grow to be a man
And show the ones before and after me so maybe they could understand
And know the facts that with power, responsibility's attached
And the appropriate response isn't always to react
And attack the weakness of beautiful creatures 'cause we can't
It's our duty to implant wisdom and patience in our stance
And it's true that woman was made from man's rib, so oddly
When you sin against your wife, you sin against your own body
And an open fisted beatdown is never an option for mine
For she was made in God's image, so I'm inclined to put her desires
And needs before me daily and see my lady as a queen
Her submission is a calling that isn't enforced by me
Cause I'm free from a GQ, Maxim, Playboy establishment
Christ is the man I strive to be like and that's no accident
My dad implanted the fuel and the means that I found vital
If your father was a deadbeat or absent, you can break the cycle
Take the Bible and tradition and follow the map accordingly
Spread the answers I've found around the world
I'll firmly lead my household and display emotions openly
And show my people what a real man's supposed to be...

[Hook 2]
Cause I'm the Alpha, called and destined, the leader of the pack
I'll listen when you talk because I've got it like that
Matter fact, I'll protect you with my life because I love you
And carry you on my back through everything we have to trudge through
The Alpha, first person in every universe
Version 6.0, sacrifice my body to the dirt
I challenge Alpha Males to change so you can see
A man standing there where a boy used to be
The Alpha...</pre>
