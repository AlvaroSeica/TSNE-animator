[Eclipse]
Yo, yo
Within a certain mile radius
The unknown violence contagous
Can't be contained and trapped like many pigs inside cages
See the, world like I see it is devided like the sea is
The faces of folls(?) and scrolls
Temperature screams and thongs shatters your perero(?)
Even hoes bigger than the square mile
The prices explodes like missiles, hitting the brissel
Breach the cold case when I whistle
The evidence is face to face, in case you fucking with disservable greats
Race wars unravel, undercover pineapples
Shadow rolling in throttle with the pedal to the metal, fly away
Like 13 Apollos when I refer to space shuttle
Incoming savages putting in damages on niggas like a scavenger hunt
Bllod, like shedding marriages, thight fit
Like cheese managers, I know the gun talk but speak silencers
Plus charges and never minuses
To let you know, just spreading knowledge
Loyal like carriages, added to violent style
Is like the postal work travellers striking on services
Gun in they hand, turn murderous
Get the picture, or image on the Kodak frame
 ** CHORUS overlaps last line, can't make it out **

CHORUS 
	"I still rock it and rock well"  (scratched by DJ A-Trak)

	"Rock well, well, well"
