[Greg Nice]
Ahhh, yeah, an international jam
First of all, I wanna let all the Queens of the whole world know
that umm... we care about you baby, we got love for you
Straight up and down
And umm... to all the players out there
Keep on playin, there ain't no time for no player hatin
There's only time for congratulatin, are you with me?
Aight, now we 'bout to get into this thing, HA HA
We 'bout to get into this thing, AOWWW

[Chorus: uncredited singer]
I'll be good, to you baby, you will see
I'll be good, to you lady, be good to me
I'll be good, to you baby, you will see
I'll be good, to you lady, be good to me, yeahh

[Greg Nice]
Peace Queen, you walk around for 9 months
with a seed inside, heard your man wanna slide
When it was time to hit the skins he stood by your side
Tellin you don't hide the vibe
Now the baby's here, as much as it's yours it's his
No perpetratin, handle your biz
Too many kids growin up today not knowin what time it is
Do you feel me?
I remember Mom Dukes took me shoppin
Same chickenheads, still car-hoppin
Like McFadden and Whitehead, it ain't no stoppin
Ever since then, I've been hip-hoppin
I send love and hugs to the single honies
Takin care of they kids with a little money
I remember Mom Dukes takin care of me
Without Pop Dukes, that's the way it had to be
I wanna thank you Queen, for raisin me
You taught Greg nothin but positivity
And reality out of curiosity
To the right of me MC Smooth B

[Chorus]

[Smooth B]
Lean on my shoulder, baby don't cry
Did he tell you that he love you for life, did he lie?
These things happen sometimes
when one doesn't know that the other one's blind
Misconceived, didn't know your wealth
Funny, cause he didn't know the God in himself
So how could he do you right?
If his mind is dim, how could he shed light?
Remember when I met you wit'cha eyes so bright?
Your teeth so white?  I knew you was right
Girl you so fine you could cause a fight
We could hang all day, stargaze at night
And you no longer have to be uptight
Keep close to my heart, we'll be alright
I need a woman like you, and your fashion
You need a man like me, with love passion

[Chorus]
