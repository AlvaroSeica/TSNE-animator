[Schleprock]
I took +Cutie for a ride in my Death Cab+
She tipped me with a kiss, I dropped her off at the Meth Lab
Before she left me, she made a +Dashboard Confessional+
And spilled the guts in +Cursive+, but whats worse
Is I could still see her +Bright Eyes+ like +Sunny Day Real Estate+
Oh my, ain't a funny way to seal, It tastes
So high but no chance
+My little Chemical Romance+, left a bad taste in my mouth
But I approached her like, +Hey Mercedes+, why the long face?
Why you cryin, no need, just put on this +Coheed+, and +Fallout
Boy+ meets Girl, +Jimmy Eat World+
But Schlep eats pills till hes all out
Not once, not twice, she was +Thrice+ times a lady
Actin all +Brand New+, but I had to
Bounce to the +Postal Services+ to
Pick up these pills that take care of my nervousness
And, on the way, I saw +Planes and Mistook 'em for Stars+
She played games, but she took 'em too far
+At the Drive-in+, watchin soft porn and you could tell
By the +Trail of the Dead+ that there was something in the Popcorn
Hop in my cab destination +Midtown+
Just to get up with some kids that like to get down
I made my rounds and that was that
In between the frowns and scraps and heartattacks
And I remember
I seen her ass +Early November+
On a +Thursday+, +Taking back Sunday+ for a refund
She shot a wink, like No Hard Feelings
Then she +Jetted to Brazil+, and the pills had me spun

Yeah, this +The Story of the Year+ right here
This is +Hot Water Music+
Cook your +Ramens+ to it
Whattup Eliot I ain't seen you in a minute
How you doin?</pre>
