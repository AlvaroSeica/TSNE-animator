[Don Cisco] It's Don Cisco, baby
        I'm up in here with this forty ounce bounce gangstas
        Gettin' more money and gettin' more subs, what you wanna do
        Yeah (Forty ounce)
        I'm fucking with Down
        The homeboy Two
        Complements of Fingazz
        Rest in peace, Roger Troutman, my uncle, we love you
        It's gangsta shit
[Fingazz]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Don Cisco]
I got chronic sack dreams
Forty ounce swishas
Bumpin'
Al Green
Dippin' and hittin' switches
High sidin' on the 405 with four or five bitches
.45 in my lap
For them gangsta hatin' snitches
Pranksters like that
Can't ride with us
I roll with Daz &amp; Kurupt, as bitches ride the nuts
Slide in the cut
Puffin' lye, high as the fuck
Fuckin' with Down and Two
Pouring, ridin' the trucks
Our rap expedition
Mexicali thuggin'
Rats
In position for the Henny nut guzzlin'
They got them by the cases
Sittin' all nice
Big bodies, big faces, boy, I'm livin' the life
For those that don't know
I'm spittin' it twice
They call me Sancho
Man, I'm hittin' your wife
A.K.A.
The Don C-I-S-C-O
Blaze up the bomb with the biotch, CEO

Chorus 1: Fingazz
My, forty ounce
Forty ounce
My, forty ounce
"Blaze up the bomb with the biotch, CEO" --&gt; Don Cisco (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Repeat Chorus 1

[Verse 2: Down]
The phone rang
And I woke up
My little homie said, "Let's get out five cups"
So I jumped in my (???), already dressed up
Grabbed my sack and my gun and got up
Picked up two about ten o'clock
He jumped in my car with this fucking glock
We left his block faster than a fucking dog
Headed for the liquor stop, bumpin' some Zapp
Stop at the liquor store, for some forties
And some regular white zags
So we could roll dank
And put forties in brown bags and drive drunk
And break the Cadillac (You know)
Driving like a maniac
On my way to get the homies are at
Fuckin', talkin' (???) Down, (???) in a cap
With this crazy ass
Me and Ducky was drinking forties
Jumpin' over the wall, doin' Down, pimpin'
Out of the car
With the forty in my hand
Ready to gangbang
Drinking forties up to Vegas
Do the same thang (Same thang)
In Oxnard drift off to summer land
Eastside gang, bang (Bang)

Chorus 2: Fingazz
My, forty ounce
Forty ounce
My, forty ounce
"With the forty in my hand..." (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
"Ready to gangbang" --&gt; Down

Repeat Chorus 1

[Verse 3: Two]
Around me
The chronic smoke lingers
And you know that I'm a forty ounce drinker
Bounce to Down's house, so we got the forty ounce now
We're all around town, with the top down
Switches
Hit it
Forties
Tilt it
Juries, wear booties, putting on and exhibit
His gangstas started at the after party (Eastside)
Puffing on chronic to my forty ounce ballot

Break: Fingazz
Get it up
Drink it up
Get that, chronic
Light it up, then pass it around
Round

(Verse 4)
[Down]    Walking on the calle with my forty ounce
      I had the joint in my mouth, when I left the house
      Heavy as fuck cause I just got out
      All blue'd up, gangbang the fuck out
      With the gangsta talk and my gangsta walk
      First day out, getting all fucked up
      With the homies in the hood, gettin' out to rub
      Homie, what up, let's fire it up
      This is for my alcoholics and all my thugs
      Let's burn it up
[Fingazz] Sho', bud, baby

Repeat Chorus 2 &amp; Chorus 1

[Fingazz]
Baby
Baby, baby
My forty ounce
My forty ounce
Yeah, baby
Get, get, get, get, get, get out your
Forty, baby
Sip on it, baby
Yeah
Baby
Sip
Your forty ounce
Your forty ounce
Forty ounce
More forty ounce
Baby, forty ounce
My forty ounce
Baby, baby
My forty ounce
Oooh
My forty ounce</pre>
