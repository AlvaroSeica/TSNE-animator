[Intro: Truck (Trinity)]
Beauty and the beast, this is my hood story
My ghetto love story, you know
Yo Beauty! (Yeah, give me a minute hold on) Beauty
(What do you want? Hold on a minute) Do me a favor, ma
Do that last batch of chicken on the stove
Come up in here in the living room, I gotta talk to you for a second
I'm getting ready to bounce love, you gotta understand, ma
I'm jetting to Miami real quick (Word?)
They got some muthafuckin' coke, ma, that's ridiculous (that's what's up)
When I come back I'mma lock this block down, baby (I know you are)
Come if you want to, I ain't gonna do you like that, but you know
I'm down there for business, don't forget now, ma
(You know I'm rolling with you either way) Ight, one

[Truck]
Ma, I'll tell my friends, you can tell your friends
We in a villa, in Miami for the whole weekend
With an in ground pool, jacuzzi to creep in
Say no more, pack ya bags, boo, take a shower
The next flight's outta the ghetto's about an hour
From the projects, sitting on Plymouth Rock
To sandy beaches, jet ski's, a hundred foot yachts
Bring a lizzy bag along, plenty places to slot
Gucci's, Chanel, Von Dutch and Viesel
Drink, smoke, weed, fuck, and watch the seagulls
Sex real good, making love by the ocean
After that, rub ya body down with suntan lotion
The Truck is here, to fulfill you fantasy
But I'm down here for business, cop weight from papi
The plans looking good, we can't move all sloppy
Remember, we dealing with Colombian dealers
The Scarface, type mob assassin killers
So I stash the burners, inside the for realers
Beauty and the beast, you can't stop the gorilla
I'm hungry, my love, I was raised that way
Whoever cross my path, then they dying today
If you riding with me, bitch, there's not much to say
My sweet confodante, my hood soulmate
Last kiss on ya lips, drive me off to the gate
Go back to the beach, stay there and wait
Daddy, I'll met you up about an hour or two
But for now, I'm right here, til this coke come through
Everything looking right, the transaction was smooth
Til a car pulled me over, tried to fuck up my groove
But I peep 'em first, so you know I can't lose
It was like a movie, on this Miami strip
Threw the four wheel in gear, I peeled off and dipped
Until I had a palm tree, and I start to flip
Jumped up, pulled out the gun, got on some shit
They throwing shots at me, and I'm throwing shots back
I refuse to give this coke up, just like that
Plus my God told beauty, I'll be right back
I caught one in the shoulder, took two in the leg
As I'm going down fading, I caught duke in his head

[Chorus 2X: Truck (Trinity)]
Hey girl, that's why I fucks with you (I know)
You hold me down, boo, whatever I'm going through (that's right)

[Outro: Trinity]
My Truck, you running them streets
I hope you thinking about me, cuz
I'm always thinking about you, you know
I got your back, whatever you gon' through
Just the way it's gotta be, you know
Beauty and the Beast, Beast and the Beauty, holla</pre>
