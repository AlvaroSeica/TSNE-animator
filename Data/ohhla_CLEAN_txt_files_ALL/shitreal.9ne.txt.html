(Verse 1: Tech N9ne)
It's friday night and I
Got my check man I
Damn I really need a (PARTY!)
So when the weekend come
I'm tryin to get deep in some (ALL NIGHT ALL DAY!)
Tryin' to break the monotony
Get away from my property
Ain't no way that you stoppin' me
At a party I got to be
But the check was a shock to me
That won't let my velocity slow
Wanna party with me let me know

(Bridge 1: Tech N9ne)
We party cause we in pain
We party to celebrate
To keep from goin insane
We party just to escape 
No matter how much the cost
Regardless of what it takes
You call my phone and it's off
I'm tryin' to numb the mistakes
But if you fell like you chill put yo cups up
But if you ill about yo bills and it's just touch
Take a drink but don't spill
This ain't no time to be still
Fuck the world what you know and realize shit is real

(Hook: Tech N9ne &amp; Krizz Kaliko)
Shit is real (20X)

(Verse 2: Tech N9ne)
Saturday night and I 
Still got some check man I
Damn I really need a (PARTY!)
Now that the weekends here
It's time for the cheefin' and beer (ALL NIGHT ALL DAY!)
Whether you puff or you're drinkin'
When life is tough we go seekin'
Somethin' to thrust or go deep in
Work is rough with no frekin'
So we lustfully speakin'
Girl you whats up for the weekend?
Plan a trip to Las Vegas
A room at the venetian
Lets go

(Bridge 2: Tech N9ne)
We party cause we in pain
We party to celebrate
To keep from goin' insane
We party just to escape
No matter how much the cost
Regardless of what it takes
If you're found or you're lost
Hey baby these are the breaks
But if you good it's understood that you prosperous
We from the hood and drinkin' good means alot to us
Put away yo knife and yo steel
Have some fun and you'll feel
Like a shield has been lifted
Yet and still shit is real

(Hook) (20X)

(Verse 3: Tech N9ne)
Sunday night and I 
Blew my check man I
Damn I really wanna (PARTY!)
Now that the weekends done 
I'm tryin' to sleep in some (ALL DAY ALL NIGHT!)
Hey yo this songs for the strong
Not for the backboneless
Workers who don't make enough for they own
But give to the homeless atonment
For the wrong that has grown
Strong for the long
Spent time for dime
You better take advantage of this moment yo

(Bridge 3: Tech N9ne)
We party cause we in pain
We party to celebrate
To keep from goin' insane
We party just to escape
No matter how much the cost
Regardless of what it takes
Never put your trust in the state
They not controllin' yo fate
But if you made it then i'll say you did yo thang today
But if you lost it then i'll say party yo pain away
Do your job for your skrill
Don't lose control of the will
It's sunday night but on monday realize shit is real</pre>
