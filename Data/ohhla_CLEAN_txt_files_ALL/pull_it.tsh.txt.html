[Intro] + (Tash)
Too much bass {*2X*}
Too much bass for this motherfuckin place {*4X*}
(Pull your money out, pull your money out)
Too much bass for this motherfuckin place {*2X*}
(Pull your money out)
We got too much bass for this motherfuckin place (Pull your money out)
Too, too much bass for this motherfuckin place (Pull your money out)
We got too much bass for this motherfuckin place (Pull your money out)
Too much bass for this motherfuckin place

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Hold up, wait
Pull it out'cha pocket {*2X*}
Ladies, hey
I know y'all love that eight-oh-eight

[Tash]
You tried life with me now try life without me
You don't wanna talk then fuck it, PayPal me (bitch~!)
So rowdy, so cocky on the mic
CaTashTrophe, nigga I'm the star that you like
Let's get it on, until the break of the dawn
Twenty-fo' inch chrome, thousand miles from home
On a tour bus, y'all probably cain't even afford us
I'm the motherfucker kicked the shit out Chuck Norris
(I know y'all feelin that eight-oh-eight)
(I know y'all punk-ass bitches can't wait)
We skate state to state, disappear without a trace
It's too much bass in yo' motherfuckin face

[Interlude]
Too much bass for this motherfuckin place (Pull your money out)
T-t-too much bass for this motherfuckin place (Pull your money out)
Too much, too much bass for this motherfuckin place (Pull your money out)
Too much bass for this motherfuckin place
We got too much bass for this motherfuckin place (Pull your money out)
Too, too much bass for this motherfuckin place (Pull your money out)
We got too much bass for this motherfuckin place (Pull your money out)
Too much bass for this motherfuckin place

[Chorus]

[Tash]
We got too much BOOM for this motherfuckin ROOM
We up all night, nigga sleep 'til noon
We bangin man, this shit is louder than a car show
Look at them, they had to call the fire marshal
... Fire Marshal Bill
He all up in this motherfucker, cain't stay still
Look at them girls they poppin them pills
... they spinnin like ferris wheels
Here go the deals, a million dollar pop
Everybody know big dawg don't stop
Pop in the drop then pull it out'cha pocket
I know one thing (this motherfuckin beat is knockin!)

[Interlude] - "pull your money out"
