[Talking]
This some quick shit, check
You're a herb and uh, it's like this
("Ya better ask somebody")

[Verse 1]
You're a herb, if you say you dig all the time
but can't find a sample from beats to the rhyme
A herb, if you claim your raps is official
But everything you sample is a fuckin' re-issue
You're a herb, sayin' that you rhyme of the mind
But ya hype man's backin' up every line
If you're in a fight but don't really wanna scrap
But act like you want it when the bouncer hold you back
You're a herb, if you tip strippers with a dollar
Those who grab the coke and then call yaself a baller
A herb, if you just now sayin' holla
If you meet a girl but are too shook to call her
If you act cool but keep ya girl on a leash
If you're still talkin' bout the Jay Nas beef
You're a herb, if you saw episode one
But never saw the trilogy, I just begun
You're a herb

Hook:
* humming to the beat with lines being mixed in*
"Ya better ask somebody"
"Yo herb"

[Verse 2]
You're a herb, if you got a flag on ya truck
But before last September you never gave a fuck
A herb, if you put ya faith in the churches
I you call yourself Bin Laden in ya verses
A herb, actually, better yet a joke
If you glorify suicide and doin' lines of coke
I you traded in your comic books and stamps
For an Avirex and some SouthPole pants
You're a herb, if you live next to Forest Gump
But go to school tying your bandana in the front
"Yo herb", if you got skills but dress like a nerd
Just cause you can rap don't mean you ain't a herb
Herb, you're a herb if you claim fame
But hide yaself online with a fake screen name
Act violent and claim to hold things
Rappin' like a thug and walk around in toe rings
You're a herb

Hook

[Verse 3]
You're a herb, if your man buy's you a bex
And you're to stingy to buy him the next
But you'll buy a drink for the opposite sex
The type of guy that snatch whole albums of the neck
You're a herb, if you fallin' for the Puma fads
Cause they got a pair of turntables in their ads
A herb, if you never pay for a date
A big herb if you never reciprocate
If you gotta leave the room or change up ya tone
When you talkin' to your girl on your cell phone
A herb, if you steal out the tip cup
If you wear your hat with the visor flipped up
You're a herb, if you like this but don't own this
If you think it's funny when you fuckin' with the homeless
If you tuck your sweatshirt in ya jeans
If you dis the goon group because you left a bean
You're a herb, motherfucker

Hook (until fade)

Yeh, take offence, 7L on the track
Esoteric with the rap, herb rappers fall back</pre>
