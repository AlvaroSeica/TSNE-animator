[Joi]
Cool, moving cool, moving cool

[Andre 3000]
Cool, moving cool

[Andre 300 and Joi]
Movin cool, moving cool, yeah

[Andre 3000]
Hey, hey

[Joi]
Hey, hey

[Andre 3000 and Joi]
I can make a stone cold blind man see a better way
But when I'm around, you dont have to much to say
La, la, la, la, la, whoo, whoo

[Andre 3000]
You see there will always be someone, taller, darker
Maybe wit a little of cheese than I got
But really, shawty you dont need nobody else

[Hook: Andre 3000]
Cause baby I am (I am) the opening act (the opening act)
The headliner (the headliner) and the after party
after party, after party, after party, after party

[Joi]
I am all that you'll ever need
I trip on how everybody see's what I am but you
I thought you'd be brave enoguh to taste my bitch's brew
Well I thought I was dealing with a man, but you're a boy
You're a boy, you're a boy
I can give you everything you want, but I cant be your toy
Oh no, oh no!

[Hook: Andre 3000] - 2X

[Big Boi]
Hey shawty, look here for a minute, shawt, shawt
Oh, my bad, my bad execuse me
You corporate America, you corporate America
I meant to say lil' lady, you look so lovely lying in wait
Like a lemon licorice, lollypop
Waiting to be licked, we dont play
But you think the shit
Was that too harsh for you lobes
Too heavy for your mentrality I suppose
Got nerves like kryptonite
Superman couldnt bend those
Kindness kills callous
Like a D-Boy movin fifty p's of that work
From A-Town to Dallas movin cool

[Hook]

Cause baby I am (I am) the opening act (the opening act)
