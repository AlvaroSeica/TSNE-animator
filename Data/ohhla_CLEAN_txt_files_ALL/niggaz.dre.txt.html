	(I'ma say this and I'ma end mine
	If you ain't down, for the Africans here
	in the United States, period point blank..
	If you ain't down for the ones that suffered in South Africa 
	from apartheid and shit
	Devil you need to step your punk ass to the side
	and let us brothers, and us Africans, step in
	and start puttin some FOOT, in that ass!!)

"Break 'em off somethin" (repeat 8X)

Chorus: Snoop Doggy Dogg (repeat 2X)

I got my finger on the trigger so niggaz wonder why
But livin in the city it's do-or-die

[Daz]
Dem wonder why me violent and no really understand
For de reason why me take me law, in me own, hand
Me not out for peace and me not Rodney King
De gun goes - click, me gun goes - bang
Dem riot in Compton and dem riot in Long Beach
Dem riot in L.A. cause dem no really wanna see
niggaz start to loot and police start to shoot
Lock us down at seven o'clock, barricades us like Beirut
Me don't show no love cause it's us against dem
Dem never ever love me cause it's sport to break dem
and kill, at my own risk, if I may
to lay, to spray, with my AK, and put it to rest

Interlude: (*female reporter*)

	(Yes we have
	There have been riots, ahh uh, rioting
	Well I don't wanna say rioting 
	but there's been looting downtown
	But right now Bree, what I want to show you is
	they have started fires down at the end of the street)

[All]	How many niggaz are ready to loot?
[Snoop] Yeah, so what you wanna do?
[Dre] 	What you wanna do?
[All] 	I said how many niggaz are ready to loot?

	"Got myself a Uzi and my brother a 9" --&gt; KRS-One

	(That's what they told us today
	In other words, you still a slave
	No matter how much money you got, you still ain't shit)

[Dr. Dre]
Sittin in my living room, calm and collected 
Feelin that gotta-get-mine perspective
cause what I just heard, broke me in half
and half the niggaz I know, plus the niggaz on the Row is bailin
Laugh now but cry much later
Ya see when niggaz get together 
they get mad cause they can't fade us
Like my niggaz from South Central, Los Angeles
They found that they couldn't handle us
Bloods, Crips on the same squad
with the Ese's help and nigga it's time to rob and mob
(And break the white man off somthin lovely, biddy-bye-bye
I don't love dem so dem can't love me)
Yo, straight puttin it down gettin my scoot on
It's jump in off in Compton so I gots to get my loot on
and come up on me some furniture or somethin
Got a VCR, in the back of my car
that I ganked from the Slausson Swap Meet
And motherfuckers better not try to stop me
Cause they will see that I can't be stopped
cause I'ma cock my Glock and pop til they all drop

Interlude: (*female reporter, then male reporter*)

	(Yes on the videotape we seem to have the
	ahh, people in the crowd throwing things at the officers)

	(And swinging at them as well, as a result
	A young woman there, you see took a swing
	at at an officer with some object in her hand)

[All]	How many niggaz are ready to move?
[Snoop] Yeah, so what you wanna do?
[Dre] 	What you wanna do?
[All] 	I said how many niggaz are ready to move?

	"Got myself a Uzi and my brother a 9" --&gt; KRS-One

Chorus

[RBX]
One-Time trigger happy, no nigga love
One-eighty-seven time, time to grab the glove
Can't get prints on a nine I throw away
or get prints on my Uzi when it spray
POP POP, POP, another motherfucker drop
And I get relief like, "plop plop fizz"
Smash, I crashed his head like a window
I ain't Nintendo, I'm high off the indo
Creepin, with the quickness, to the cut
Bust, one to his head, while he munches on a donut
and crack-up, so now he best to back up
I guess I gots to pack up, filling, the clip up
I zip up-town, but motherfuckin cops are all around
Helicopters flyin, these motherfuckers tryin
to catch me and stretch me on Death Row
But hell no, suppose black refuse to go??

Interlude: (*male reporter*)

	(This is now coverin a very, very wide area of Los Angeles
	where these fires have been, aah, ignited
	I mean, from here to the, aah
	to the South end of South Central is a long way

"Break 'em off somethin" (repeat 8X)

[Daz]
The outcome of this is destruction, so them all fall
Niggaz don't give a fuck, so them bust and them fall
The, description of three blacks
shows no justice, so, pick up it's your right
If you riot again, me, turn the other cheek
We, be too many, me got, me nine to my side
So me bust, flick, cause he don't give a fuck
and me don't give a fuck
And all my problems end with that BUCK BUCK

[Snoop Doogy Dogg]
Blak blam, blam til dem fall
Listen to the shots from my nigga Doggy Dogg, biddy-bye
Dr. Dre, him bust gun shots
Diggity Daz and RBX, dem bust gun shots
Come again!</pre>
