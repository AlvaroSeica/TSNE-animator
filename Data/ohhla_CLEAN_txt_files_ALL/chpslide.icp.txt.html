Get, get, get, get loose
Get, get, get, get loose
Gon' and break it down

And here's what you're gonna do, Juggalos
You're gonna take those guns right
Put 'em in the air and bus', bus', bus', bus'

Spinnin around

Round and round and round we go
And round and around we go
(Round and round)
Round and round and round we go
And round and around we go
