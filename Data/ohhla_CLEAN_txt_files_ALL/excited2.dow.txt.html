What's up what's up

[Mr. Lil One]

Mr. Lil One]
I'm so excited got ya bitch on my dick
and she still wants to ride it

[Mr. Shadow]
I'm so excited got ya bitch on my dick
and she still wants to ride it

[Mr. Shadow]
I'm sitting here thinking damn isn't that a shame
You're kissing on your lady while she's mumbling my name
You think that you're a playa, look who's numbers on my pager
I told you she'd be callin me sayin she's all in love with me
We took it to the beach then she gave a little speech
How she loves the way we grind when we lay between the sheets
It's getting kind of shady second thoughts about your lady
But you were still telling people that you two were getting married
Now go ahead and get your marry on, while I carry one
Drinking perron, with your lady through my song
I knew it all along, she be coming back for more
When she was on her knees you were working at the store
Sweating 9 to 5 while she suits me in your ride
Getting hickies on my neck putting baby girl in check
Went once went twice it's the stalker of your life
Got you wonderin can you trust her as your wife

[chorus]
repeat 2

[Mr. Lil One]
Now I know your state of mind can't compare to mine
I fin to brake it down like an ese doin time
You grief through the highs, stroll through the lows
You watch how you act cause your character shows
How you really are, never mind a rap star
You pretty face girl but your ass behind bars
Now your in a tank with slippers and rules
some of them g's and some of them fools
Sitting there stressin, sad reminissen
Never really flew straigh so she's a peasent
Yes indeed, I'n knowin what you need
Learn how to write and learn how to read
All between the lines all between the lies
Sit there and learn while she's giving me the eyes
Take her to the pad, take her to the crib
Give it to her raw like you never did

[chorus]
repeat 2

[Mr. Shadow]
I'm flossing on your rims while you rap about your brims
You need to reculaged while your girl comfess her sins
Making scary hits while you be licking harry tits
Ask your lady where shes been while you punchin in at 6
You better be ready to her some ruff and nasty sex
Like how she pages me from work with that 14to 3 that 69er
I know shes been a tough one rough enough to bust one
Never have I loved one so how the hell could I love one
Lust one, never have I wined her or dined her
I leave that up to you cause all I do is get behind her
I find it kind of funny every week you give her money
With that she buys the lotion she be rubbin all over my tummy
Huggin me and kissing me looking me in the eyes
Tellin me how she loves me and wants me in her life
But I aint payin no minds cause all Im doing is making pine
I told your future wife that nickels aint my type

[chorus]
