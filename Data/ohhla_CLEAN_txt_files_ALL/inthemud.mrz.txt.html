Yo I wanna hit it if it's taboo, I do, outside on the avenue
And let the whole world get a view of me slammin' you
In the middle of fifth avenue, we look like kung fu
When we do what we love to do
Unzip me and ride, can you feel me inside
I feel a rush when we touch, yeah, you're doing it right
Bounce to the rhythm, ohh yeah, you my bad girl
Red leather skirt, nipple rings, dragon tattoos
Down for whatever, in a swimming pool, at a barbeque
In full view, we be going boom, boom, boom, boom, dirty, dirty
Tell me how you want it girl, but give it to me, hurry

Like that, yeah, we livin' it, what
We be suckin' on toes, raw dog, uh ha
See I'm lovin' it kinky, bitin' all on your butt
So what's up, now you know, can I get some or what

I need a bitch I can fuck in the mud
Swang that thang cause it's never enough
Do you know what it's like riding a thug
Dirty, nasty, it ain't nothing but love
I need a bitch I can fuck in the mud
Swang that thang cause it's never enough
Do you know what it's like riding a thug
Dirty, nasty, it ain't nothing but love

Dirty dirty, dirty, dirty
Dirty dirty, ain't nothin' but love, dirty
Dirty dirty, dirty, dirty
Dirty dirty, ain't nothin' but love

I love fuckin' all types of bitches
they all delicious, I even asked the lord to help me out
God gave me one Dominican, one Puerto Rican
and one ordinary everyday type of slut with a big round butt
That I could fuck, so legs up, throw 'em up in the air
There ain't no other man like fuckin' the man right here
You can call me T-bone cause I love to bone
My honey's in them little shorts with them cheeks all showin'

All the bad girls shakin' ass and titty, what up
Just throw your legs up in the air like you don't give a fuck
We livin' kinky, straight up, bitin' on your butt
So what's up, now you know, can I get some or what

I need a bitch I can fuck in the mud
Swang that thang cause it's never enough
Do you know what it's like riding a thug
Dirty, nasty, it ain't nothing but love
I need a bitch I can fuck in the mud
Swang that thang cause it's never enough
Do you know what it's like riding a thug
Dirty, nasty, it ain't nothing but love

Dirty dirty, dirty, dirty
Dirty dirty, ain't nothin' but love
Dirty dirty, dirty, dirty
Dirty dirty, ain't nothin' but love

I'm lookin' for that sweet thang swangin' on my jang-a-lang
I love your tongue ring, make a motherfucker sang
On the sly, you and I sweatin', gettin' wet and
Ice cream on your nipples, should be on the big screen
Sex rated, triple X rated, joy ride, I glide
Deep inside, outside, in the country side
In a waterfall, on a mountain side, raw hide, worldwide
All skin and ginseng, belly ring nibblin'
You ain't innocent suckin' on your finger
Nasty little thang, we can sex so where the ladies at
I got a six pack and some candle wax in the back
Of my cadillac, she said my green backs was an aphrodisiac
I said sit back and relax, don't over react
But when we done, you gon' need ice packs for your ass crack
So I fucked her, dropped her off on the train tracks
Money hungry bitch, push on, don't ever come back

I need a bitch I can fuck in the mud
Swang that thang cause it's never enough
Do you know what it's like riding a thug
Dirty, nasty, it ain't nothing but love
I need a bitch I can fuck in the mud
Swang that thang cause it's never enough
Do you know what it's like riding a thug
Dirty, nasty, it ain't nothing but love

I need a bitch I can fuck in the mud
Swang that thang cause it's never enough
Do you know what it's like riding a thug
Dirty, nasty, it ain't nothing but love
I need a bitch I can fuck in the mud
Swang that thang cause it's never enough
Do you know what it's like riding a thug
Dirty, nasty, it ain't nothing but love</pre>
