Song:   The Plan
Typed by: Cno Evil

[Chorus: Crunch Lo]
Yo, what's the plan? The plan is to snatch all you can
From six to hundreds, to thousands of plans
For my F.A.M., goal is to snatch all the gold
The root of all evil, got us out of control

[Molly-Q]
We all amongst friends, goodfellas and godfathers
Knowledge find it and tried it, his dime pieces, ya'll go feces
Indy in the ghetto, style meadow, incognito
Infultrate the papi boot, then sneak through with no equal
Knowledge my dog, evil love all ways
Leather suits, night troops, rather wearing Timb boots
Hawaiian stay charged, said lieutant sarge
Captain Crunch C. Major, Othorized on the boards
From Ferry two times, lose tactics, stay bandit
Represented ill trips, with his diamond punch netted
I sweat like Big Val from Staten to Manhattan
Hurry tapping more creams, than organized into rapping
The goal, the goal is to snatch all gold
The root of all evil, got us out of control

[Lounge Lo]
Now stand by, check on how I got the fly
From overseas to out of state now back to S.I.
Guess why, like why ask why, like blood cry
Ooh, I die, puff la, but me not gon' cry
Bout the situation cuz these niggas had me waiting
Hallucinating, off that shit that they was baking
Now they gon' find a real nigga from the grain
I bring the pain, I got a stain for ya name
Fuck the fame, I'm in it for the C.R.E.A.M. like my team
Wu-Tang Clan, 36 styles are mean
Faces, check the traces, back up to spaces
V.A. tried to get down, but look who got it locked now
Killah Hill Projects, along G.P. Wu
Wild West, Jungle Nilz and the grain who be through
Yo, we flew, '92 with slang too
Live and direct from the 1-6-Oooh
I thought you knew, interlude and now I'm here
Making plans with my F.A.M., Othorized they got my man
I give a sware, love to my niggas who ain't here
'97, 19, I'm holding down my square

[Chorus]

[Shawn Wigs]
Plans, plot it out like blueprints (ladies and gents)
See I've been waiting a long time to rinse
My face and hands in hip hop, waters and lands
Getting paid by the grands, take it to the fucking plan
And going off track for a damn thing
Got this rap shit wide like Colombians with drug rings
That's my steez, premeditates success, Dutch Masters and hineys
While we preview the progress
Power rules made, rock the show, get rid of all the white people
Othorized F.A.M. lethal
Like bags of murder shit, burn bag the soul
First we got together with the shit that old gold
Now we got pounds of Heineken, meeting ends
Rocking whips with eighteen karot grins
And chrome rims, mad things have changed
It's more cream in the pocket, instead of spare change
All we here is fame, with smell, I'm the same
And I'm never gonna change, the gritty C nigga
Few cut short, and short change

[Crunch Lo]
Where's my pimps, fresh from up state down the street
Do what is real deep
Stay on your feet and tred water
Verbal slaughter was the order from the captain
Big up them niggas steady stacking the cream flow
Status is low, no need to know about my history
Building this mystery trying to get with me, walking dictionary
With killa instincts, for cemetaries, is where these fags end up
In a hurry, flurry's a style, brought in a box, son
Infered on, so I think I should spot ya
I got ya asshole, and you next to talking
Shit, watch the rhyme razor split
Precision on the flip mission, wishing I never started spitting
All these words, go to work on gods and herbs
Fuck with my nerves, stop blinding like Slick Rick
I hang with slick dick, cornbraids four fifths
It's all real, fuck goalies, just snorting the fiends, over and over
And showing no fear, when we boosting on the corner

[Chorus]

[Crunch Lo]
Scarred my soul, but the knowledge we ain't right
Stay tight, all my peeps hold it down, when we shine
Like lights on figurines, we might consume the real
You know how we feel, repeat a nice meal
And fat Dutchies then appear with fat slat of dat</pre>
