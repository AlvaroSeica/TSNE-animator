[Coach Z]
Coach Z, Coach Z, one-two one-two
Coach Z, one-two one-two
Coach Z, Coach Z, one-two one-two
Coach Z, one-two one-two

These peoples, these peoples, these peoples try to fade
These peoples, these peoples, these peoples try to fade
These peoples, these peoples, these peoples try to fade
... fade me

[Chorus: Coach Z]
These peoples try to fade me! I can't handle it
Ca-Ca-Ca-Call me on my cell phone - I gets busy!
These peoples try to fade me! I can't handle it
Ca-Ca-Ca-Call me on my cell phone - I gets busy!

[Coach Z]
Coach Z's got money {*ka-ching*} but not much
Coach Z's got money {*ka-ching*} but not much
Coach Z's got money {*ka-ching*} but not much
I could use a dollar, I could use a couple bucks
I'm so old school (one-two one-two)
They tore da school down (one-two one-two)
Where my lasers at? ... Where my lasers at, y'all?
Where my lasers at? (Where my lasers at?) Where my lasers at, y'all?
Wherrre, my, lasers at
All the peoples tried to tell me where my lasers at
And your mother tried to show me all the laser crabs
Then I got a bunch of types, a bunch of laser dabs
{*Coach Z does sound effects*} Peww bowww, beewww
Pew pew pew, pew, que!

[Chorus]

[Coach Z]
I got to see the sweet doctor (I'm Dr. Sweet!)
I got to see the sweet doctor (I'm Dr. Sweet!)
I got the grown-up beats (I'm Dr. Sweet!)
I got the grown-up beats (I'm Dr., Dr., Dr. Beats)

These peoples, these peoples, these peoples try to fade
These peoples, these peoples, these peoples try to fade
These peoples, these peoples, these peoples drop a baaaaerrrmb

I can flow (one-two one-two)
I can freak (one-two one-two)
Uhh.. I can freak and flow at the same time</pre>
