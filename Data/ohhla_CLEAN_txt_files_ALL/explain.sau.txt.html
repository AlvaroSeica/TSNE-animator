Song:   Explain My Heart
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Saul Williams - speaking]
The war I feel in mem natural catastrophe
A tremor in the heart, where feelings have their start
The blood flows to the brain, each feeling gets a name
And gets its turn to speak, when feelings reach their peak
The voices of unnamed, the sane labelled insane
The truth is changing lanes, as I'm crossing the street
My heartbreak skips a beat, the noises of the street
Like lava through my veins, the love I can't explain

[Saul Williams - singing]
I take my heart and I divvy it
Separate pawns in the city blocks
I walk around on the city blocks
Until my sirens enter my thoughts
Explain to me the price of a free soul
It seems to me each highway has it's toll

I take my heart and I divvy it
Separate pawns in the city blocks
I walk around on the city blocks
Until my sirens enter my thoughts
It seems to me each highway has it's name
But there's something I can't explain
Explain my heart {*4X*}

I take my heart and I divvy it
Separate pawns in the city blocks
I walk around on the city blocks
Until my sirens enter my thoughts
It sees in every heart that beats
Employ the streets for weeks into the soldiers of my mind
If I can enjoy the pain
My heart's the same as them this time
Explain my heart {*4X*}

[Saul Williams - speaking]
Divided heart, divided testament
Mummified by dogmas, the present has no history
There's no time like the present, no better place to be
Than where you are, within my heart
Like within you, is me

Explain my heart {*4X*}</pre>
