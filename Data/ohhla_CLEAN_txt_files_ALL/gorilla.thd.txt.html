[Six Two]
Big baller, on fly diggy, black four fifty
Quickly run into your city like a gypsy
I kept a half an ounce of buddah to get the cash and bounce
51 mansion, I ain't stopped to see who doin' the askin'
All these player haters doin' this blastin'
So while these fools' words be heated like passion
I'm gon' catch end, what? - I'm workin' with the full grip
Ain't no future in that bullshit
So I pull shit, off like a presidential
Sniff, stay illegal like the governmental
Fake is back at it, all the time
Got my shit lookin' bright like the shoes shine
Rub you off like the massage when I'm on the grind
Cause in my mind, you better get yours, cause I'ma get mine fool
 
[Chorus: Dr. Dre]
Stackin' them bricks got you trippin'
Them cookies and them cakes got you slippin'
A flock of birds got you in the yard simpin'
While me be gettin' cheers and ?? all day, Gorilla Pimpin'
Stackin' them bricks got you trippin'
Them cookies and them cakes got you slippin'
A flock of birds got you in the yard simpin'
While me be gettin' paid, all day Gorilla Pympin'
 
[Six Two]
Now I'ma drop a jewel right quick, G shit
You finna get the convict, subliminal bomb shit
Criminal, monoply, philosophy
Million dollar properties, cheers overseas, status
Peep my mackies have apparatus
Known for them, I give the Grammer from Atlanta to Atlantis
I handle this, pound for pound, Braud Jouhn on scandalous
Break it down, I'm gonna give you what you need
Full balls, big dick and straight weed
Or get wet up, fool, you better get up
And get yours from the T.O.P. - fuckin' with me
Smooth Jacks and Braud Backs and Kool Max 
Some criminal contacts, be lovin' my platinum plaques
But that ain't who I'ma goes at
On the real, dollar bills mothafucker
Can you flow with that?
 
[Chorus: Dr. Dre]
 
[Break: Dr. Dre]
It's goin' on and on, nigga
It's goin' on and on and on
It's goin' on and on, my nigga
It's goin' on and on and on
It's goin' on and on, nigga
It's goin' on and on and on
It's goin' on and on, my nigga
G's up, goin' on and on and on
 
[Six Two]
Knick Knack Patty Whack, give the dog a bone
No give him a chicken 'til my nigga is on
It don't stop, until your life get popped
And you can sell them 5 million when you drop hot jam
Better then the rest of them
I'm, therefore, I pack the floor when I'm on my tour
If we can't make it, though, nigga's actin' hardcore
It ain't the cost though, nigga it's the cash flow
All the ass-holes, for sheezy, best believe me
Ain't no tellin' where my G's be
Nationality, reality, nigga's salary or locality
Ugh, the Grand Finale, on my way back from Cali'
Fuckin' twin bitches and their friends for their ends
And it's on nigga
Rock, slang it to you like the dirty cop
Cluck 'til the world stop, make them all drop
My nigga Doc' empty out the whole box
I set it off, come on, come out get yours
Talkin' about your old black clothes
Caddillac does, money from fat whores
You know that's how Gorilla Pimpin' goes
Realize that you gotta get yours
All dimes, all the time, better get yours
Cause I'ma get mine, fool
 
[Chorus: Dr. Dre]
 
[Outro: The D.O.C. Talking]
Real froze on your back
Got game, they do not know how to act</pre>
