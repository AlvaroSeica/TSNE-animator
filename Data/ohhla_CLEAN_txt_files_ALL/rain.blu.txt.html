[Blue Raspberry]
There's no need to be in love
I'm not the one you're thinking of
Do you feel me, or where I'm coming from, hun
I'm not the one to take part in your silly games
Cuz boy, you're not the same
It's too late to make a change, oh no

[Chorus: Blue Raspberry]
Why did you, do what you, did to me, for you to
Go out there, to someone, else and cheat, cheat on me
And then come, on my guess, everything, is so sweet
I can't take, the heartache, and the pain, in my life
Why did you, do what you, did to me, for you to
Go out there, to someone, else and cheat, cheat on me
And then come, on my guess, everything, is so sweet
All I see is rain...

[Blue Raspberry]
I had no reason to stick around
If you within yourself, don't have your feet
Planted on solid ground, solid ground
Might as well go on with the rest of your life alone
Without a love, there is no hope
I opened up my heart to you, I let my guard down
Instead of you doing the same, you chose to fool around
I'll try to give you all of time
But I don't think you're in the right mind
It's over, it's over...

[Chorus]

[Blue Raspberry]
You tell me, why you're always making me stressed
You must love to see me always being upset
There's none of that no love, playing with my life
You gonna think of how it was, with me right by your side

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
