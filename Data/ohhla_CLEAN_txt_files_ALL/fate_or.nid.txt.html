[Dug Infinite]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yo can't you tell that this hip-hop shit, be on the spiral
Make me set up shop, I keep it hot like a pyro-
-maniac, the reason is mainly that, a lot of cats
they lack, format and structure when they rap
It's like a mission, who wants to get rich without a stencil?
Who told you a million was fly as your closest pencil?
Chasin cash, I'm chasin tools, think about it
Chasin ass, I'm breakin rules, a visionary
Legendary in my own right, give off my own light
I use my own sight, my vocals vibrate then take flight
through the air blaze your eardrum what you hear sums up
the light reflected off of the moon, makes me the sun
Plus you the sun - soon as my record is spun
I rotate at thirty-three and a third like six tons
Just followed by twenty-one ciphers, centrifugal force
got me trapped on earth, like a lifer
'Til death do us part, what else could this be?
Nothin else could this be but fate, or destiny - yeah

[Chorus]
Yeah, is it fate or destiny?
I walk a tightrope tryin to find insanity
How can it be, that the sun don't shine on darker days?
It penetrates my soul, in better ways
Well, is it fate or destiny?
I walk a tightrope tryin to find insanity
How can it be, that the sun don't shine on darker days?
It penetrates my soul, in better ways

[No I.D.]
Yo yo, it's purely educational, I'm big wheelin like Infinite
on the skate you know the way that we do it we cue it and set it off
Drop the buried treasure, dig in every measure
It's for the people's pleasure..
B-boy virtuoso, never comin so-so, I'm oh so
ready and steady, got the beats to keep you sweaty
It's ghetto - precise never falsetto
Keep your next move in the tempo's alegretto
Yo bounce to it, yo as I keep every ounce fluid
Touchin on your brain with extra points of pain
It's Infinitely, D-U-G, No I.D.
Yo and incidently, I do my thing you can't prevent me
Cause innocently, I ruggedly and gently
master skill and art just like a sensei
Handle competition that's against me, my content be
intense that's how I make my fate, or destiny

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Yo, is it fate or destiny?
I walk a tightrope tryin to find insanity
How can it be, that the sun don't shine on darker days?
It penetrates my soul, in better ways
Well, is it fate or destiny?
I walk a tightrope tryin to find insanity
How can it be, that the sun don't shine on darker days?
It penetrates my soul, in better ways

[Outro]
Hip-hop ain't goin nowhere, b-boys will never die
Uhh.. Chi-Town, town-t-town-town town town
Yo, you know the name, you know the game, check it out now
Two thousand, rock on, like this yo
Like this yo, uhh, uhh, yeah..
Watch out! Watch out</pre>
