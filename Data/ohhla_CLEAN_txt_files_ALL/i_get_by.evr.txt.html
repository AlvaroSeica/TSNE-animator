[Everlast]
The government man keep callin my house
Talkin 'bout I owe, harassin my spouse
Gotta park my truck, on another block
Cause the subprime loan got my ass in hock
Got a couple good friends, with helpin hands
I need a brand new job with the health care plan
They closed the plant, and stole my job
and told me crime don't pay unless you ask the mob
So I smoke a little grass, drink a little wine
Watch a little tube, try to kill a little time
And every single day I fall a little more behind
But I'm payin it no mind, it'll all be fine

[Chorus]
I get by {*scratched: "Got it good"*}
I barely get by {*"Got it good"*}
I barely get by - by - stay a little high
I ain't gonna lie; I barely get by
I barely get - by, stay a little high
I ain't gonna lie {*"Got it good"*}

[Everlast]
Party people in the place to be
Put your hands in the sky if you barely gettin by
It's on and on to the break of dawn
Got to keep the rent paid and the power on
Yes yes y'all~! And it, never stops
I don't trust the government I 	don't trust no cops
We dip and we dive and we socialize
We struggle and we strive just to stay alive

[Chorus] - first third only

[Everlast]
And when I finally get home, I can't relax
cause I've been overworked and I've been overtaxed
My bank account's empty all my cards are maxed
And I ain't lookin for no pity I'm just statin the facts
I voted for some change, and it's kind of strange
how it's all I've got in my pocket
I bought a few LED's, now I'm growin some trees
and it's a sweet fuckin hustle, don't knock it
I told y'all befo' I would break the law
to put food in my baby girl's belly
Cause a Senator man, took a bribe in hand
and went and shipped my job to New Delhi

[Chorus]

[Everlast]
Party people in the place to be
Put your hands in the sky if you barely gettin by
It's on and on to the break of dawn
Got to keep the rent paid and the power on
Yes yes y'all~! And it, never stops
I don't trust the government I 	don't trust no cops
I dip and I dive and I socialize
I struggle and I strive just to stay alive

[Chorus]</pre>
