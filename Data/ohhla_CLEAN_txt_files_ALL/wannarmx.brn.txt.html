[ Brandy ]
Oh yeah
Oooooh yeeeeaaah
I would like to get to know if I could be
The kind of girl that you could be down for
Cause when I look at you I feel something tell me
That you're the kind of guy that I should make a move on

[ MC Lyte ]
Yeah
I get exotic with the melodic tune
I get hypnotic with Da Moon, but you gotta put me down soon
I flip a sideshow if you come my way
Up, down and around, even sideways
I'm about as ready as the Lyte can get
We can go all out, I ain't afraid of the sweat
But yet I bet you got the techniques to freak a girl inside out
What's that all about?
Can I have some of that? You gotta put me on
Word around town is you're nine men strong
I wanna be put on in the worst way
Since the first day, I think it was a Thursday
You be that brother that I wanna sink my teeth in
Make me wanna ask, "Where the hell you been?!"
I like the way you be with all that personality
But I got flavor till.. you needs to get with me

[ Brandy ]
I wanna be down
With what you're goin through
I wanna be down
I wanna be down with you
No matter time of day or night, it's true
I wanna be down

[ YoYo ]
He was born 20 years ago just to pimp those
Every day new clothes, look at the Cut Coupe holds
On 3, got the heat, so bluff it
Slangin [edited] cause it's more than 20 ducats
Struck it, kinda rich, now his pockets lookin straight
Slammed the D's on the Benzo, pancake by the gate
Moms lookin straight, with her half she got great
Loungin in her new home that's up out the States
I be your Carmel, won't tell, you can get it when you want it
Even though you got chicks all up on it
Don't matter, cause brother, you're fly, I can't lie
I been mackin daddy from the corner of my eye
Now baby, bring it on, don't be frontin on your baby boo
All I wanna know is what's up with you?
How can I get with you?
Seems like you got a hold on me
It must be voodoo, cause baby, I want you

[ Brandy ]
I wanna be down
With what you're goin through
I wanna be down
I wanna be down with you
No matter time of day or night, it's true
I wanna be down

[ Queen Latifah ]
Here it come now
And it don't stop
About ye short, about ye tall
About so big, about so small
About this length, about this width
About this flow, about this gift
Instinct leadin me right up your alley way
Skit the Moët, let's chill with some Alizé
Nuff stress in our day
Let me massage your mind as my mental starts to play
A ghetto star's who you are
And I be your sexual chocolate bar
And I gotta keep you strong for the cause
And you gotta keep me strong for the tours
Brotherman and me, and the family
What else could we be what no one understands of but we
You were the first to tame me
Ah - Big Tee - hah, I'm out

[ Brandy ]
I wanna be down
With what you're goin through
I wanna be down
I wanna be down with you
No matter time of day or night, it's true
I wanna be down

[ Queen Latifah ]
Hey
Here we go, here we go, here we go now
And it's on, yeah
And you don't stop
Brandy is in the house and ya don't stop
Until the body rock
Keep it on
And you don't stop
You rock on to the sure, shot shot
Brandy rock, rock on</pre>
