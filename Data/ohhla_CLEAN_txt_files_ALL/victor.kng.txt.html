[Intro: Self Rachet (Sharecka)]
Holla... (Fuck that!

Uh-huh (Cyborg Nation)
What what? (Fuck where I rest at, nigga
I rest at where you rest at, nigga!

Let's take it, nigga! Test that, nigga!
You motherfucker! See me when you see me!
Your mother!) City

You know where the best at where we rest at, nigga!
Test that when you test that, nigga!)
B.V.I.

[Chorus: V-Gully]
We nah look like we are shotta right now but
We could a dust shotta boy now
We nah look like we are rapper right now but
We could a dust rapper boy now
We nah look like we are pop star now yo
We could a dust pop star now
You must nah think we can't make it clap yo
We coulda just clap it up now...

[Timbo King]
In '92 when Ill Shy passed Shawn and Richie
Original rude boys and they all from the '50s
Tall man kept a gun in his hand before a shotta
Kings died way in front of the ice cream parlor
Where the black at? Pat had dimes for sale
The same time Shamel and Justice went to jail
Linked with Spark but the streets wasn't feelin' the tracks
Always knew I was nice but the price of fame, reminded me of a dice game
Yeah, Pac came to Tilden, did "Above the Rim"
Had Church Ave wonderin' what up with Timb
Nigga thorough and his man Jarrett bust his hammer
'Til the judge put him in the slammer, one to three
I'm like, "Dark, it's just you and me"
That's when I met Reckalect, yea
We was both in the spot
We was trippin' off our eyes cuz one of them cocked
Make a long story short now, we the Fam
Squads turn to Brickface, never ran never will
One mil for the Capitol deal, shit was real
Now we back to square one, I fear none
I walk through the valley of hate with big guns
I walk through the valley of hate with big guns

[Chorus: V-Gully]
We nah look like we are shotta right now but
We could a dust shotta boy now
And we nah look like we are rapper right now but
We could a dust rapper boy now
And we nah look like we are pop star now yo
We could a dust pop star now yo
Ya better know I be a shotta right now
Ya better know say that a Gutter right now

[Gutterman]
Ya boy rap now, four pound invadin' ya set
Who them niggaz with? Everybody lookin' around
Bogard status, a Devo in ya set
My shit gutter nigga, so never mind who the next
Wherever our killa niggaz, 56 showin' respect
Call tracks up, I.R.S. come and collect
See this street game, top notch, knowin' ya vets
Mind's stressed out, every minute signin' a cheque
Comin' correct... missed stray, wish I could fly
Take a break from the shit, go and chill in the sky
I wonder why, y'all the ones causin' my pain
Look at 'em whisperin' sweet nothings, candy rain
Pay ya no mind, years later, still on the grind
Game stepped up, mixtapes, spittin' my lines
Pressin' rewind, who the fuck you talkin' about?
Ask me, best a nigga leakin' blood from his mouth
Games is done, who the fuck claimin' his son?
Size his crew up, find a nigga, lay him in the Sun
Scoop Malik up, B.V.I. shirt on his back
Age nine and he fine, no need to worry about that
Gutter on the track, now that's some shit to worry about
My new shit niggaz, yo I'm leavin' you out
Ain't a rapper, just had to get some shit off my chest
Bump this when I pull up on the block with Self
Self Rachet!

[Chorus: V-Gully]
We nah look like we are shotta right now but
We could a dust shotta boy now
And we nah look like we are rapper right now but
We could a dust rapper boy now
And we nah look like we are pop star now but
We could a dust pop star now yo
You must nah think we can't make it clap yo
We coulda just clap it up now...

[Self Rachet]
I'm tired of seein' you fuckers
When niggaz give the word I be the first to fuckin' touch ya
No need to fly niggaz down for these cocksuckers
Aiyo they all suck dick
Yo they talk amongst eachother but they don't say shit
No bricks, no bitch, no chips, no whips
No sticks, no flips, no love for you son
Now gwan for ya gun pussy, I make you famous
Bust shots like sky rockets at the niggaz you came with
And nothin' changed, prick, B.V.I. we made a brick
I see two bees in my eye, nigga, I'm on some shit
I split two peas in a pod with my whole damn click
I spit two tray pounds, who the fuck need a clip?
Five guns, six sit, five run, six snitch
Fifty-six, fifty-six, five-six, five-six
We bully you breeds, you want the truth? You niggaz is fleas
I've been gone for a minute, now I'm back 'til I've finished
I will survive, beat a battle with tears in my eyes
Self Rachet, I don't need no gun to take yo' package
Total package just hit big, yeah it's way over classic
I build a tent for my militant and move with the masses
You seeds are in, you stage-playin' you just actin'
We the type to get it poppin' nigga while you get it pappin'
Sayin' there's help, I'm the elf, nigga good with rappin'
Brook-lawn, Jack Jr., nigga thief for that jackin'
Crook-lawn, Crook Sr., nigga good with that clappin'

[Sharecka]
Brooklyn, Brooklyn
Hoodtrepeneurs, Cyborg Nation at it's finest
At it's finest, hahahah
Everybody in the crowd, what up what up?
Yeah put yo' guns in the air, what up what up?
All my Brooklyn niggaz yeah, what up what up?
Yeah put yo' guns in the air... hah hah!
Aiyo I spits the five
If it wasn't for the deal, yo, I'd stick or rob
Run up in Jake's spot, take Rock or Todd
Hey he can keep his jewels cuz I like his tie
If a brother hangin' low on funds
When I see Nelly, he gon' have to give up yo his Air Force Ones
I have Mystikal sayin', "Hah, yeah that boy there be crazy"
Missy's so slim now she could have my baby
Trina I ain't Juvenile but if you "Back That Ass Up"
You could fall on the floor cuz I want bucks
Seems to me nowadays these artists ain't robbin'
Eminem got 80% soundin' garbage
Artists goin' platinum in a weak, yeah blame it on The Neptunes beats
When you see him in the streets and he's spitting weak
Lot of cats yellin' hard, nigga who you be?
Nigga who you be?
Come on! Brooklyn up in this motherfucker yeah
Cyborg Nation in this motherfucker yeah
B.V.I., Hoodtrepeneurs, what?

[Outro: Sharecka]
Yeah... that's cuz they sayin' nothin', man
Hoodtrepeneurs, Cyborg Nation, B.V.I.
Bo King, nigga... your father!
Scam new and improved, get it?
Understand you with... your mother!
Nigga!
Stand up, get the fuck outta here!
Our nieces and nephews, sisters and cousins too
Royal Fam... your grandmother!
Yeah... that's word to the bunion on my left toe, nigga
Yep... come on, let's go... your mother!
Fuck that!
I said it, nigga!</pre>
