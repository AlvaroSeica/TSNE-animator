[Intro: vocal samples - repeat 2X]
Like the fire that needs the air
I won't burn unless your there
 
[50 Cent - over samples]
Yea, I need you, I need you to hate 
So I can use you for your energy
You know, its real shit, feel this
 
[Verse 1]
America got a thing for this gangster shit, they love me
Black Chuckas, black skully, leather Pelle Pelle
I take Spit over Ramo's shit, I'm a vandal
Got that silver duct tape. on my trey-eight handle 
The women in my life bring confusion and shit
So like Nino in "New Jack," I holla "Cancel that bitch!"
Look at me, this is the life I chose
Niggaz around me so cold, man my heart done froze
I built an empire on the low, the narc's don't know
I'm the weatherman, I take that cocoa leaf and make that snow
Sit back, watch it turn to dope, watch it go out the do'
O after O, you know? Homey
I'm just triple beam, dreamin, niggaz be, schemin
I fiend to live the good life, the fiends are just fiendin
Conceal my weapon nice and neat so you can't see
The penitentiary is definitely out the question for me

[Chorus]
I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle (hustle)
Nigga you get in my way while I'm tryin to get mine
And I'll buck you (buck you)
I don't care who you run with, or where you from
Nigga fuck you (fuck you)
I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle (hustle)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I don't know shit about gymnastics I somersault bricks
And black talons start flyin, when a nigga flip
I cook crack in the microwave, niggaz can't fuck with me
Man my co-D's, call me Chef Boy-R-50
Check my logic, smokers don't like seeds in they weed shit 
Send me them seeds, I'll grow 'em what they need
Them ain't Chia pet plants in the crib - that's chronic
And I'm sellin 'em for 500 a pop god damn it
I sell anything I'm a hustler, I know how to grind
Step on grapes put it in water and tell you it' wine
If you analyze me, what you will find
is the DNA of a crook and what goes on in my mind
is contagious, hypnotic, it sounds melodic
If rap was the block or a spot, I'd be that potent product 
Now get a load of me, flashy, far from low key
And you can locate me where ever that dope be
Gettin money man

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
It's the Hustler's Ambition, close your eyes listen see my vision
Mossberg pumpin, shotgun dumpin
The drama means nothin, it's part of the game
Catch me in the coupe switchin lanes or in the jeweler switchin chains
I upgrade from dirty "BS" to clean VS
Rocks that I copped from proceeds from the spot 
I got the energy to win, I'm full of adrenaline
Play the curb and get nauseous, watchin the spinner spin
I made plans to make it, a prisoner of the state
Now I can invite yo' ass out to my estate
Them hollow tips bent me up, but I'm back in shape
Pour Cristal in the blender make a protein shake
I'm like the East coast number one playboy B
Hugh Hefner'll tell you he ain[t got shit on me
The feds watch me, icey they can't stop me
Racist, pointin at me, "Look at Niggaraci" - hello!

[Chorus]</pre>
