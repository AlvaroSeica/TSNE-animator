{*static and sustained tones are heard*}

[female robotic voice]
Our emotions have a vibratory frequency to them
There are only two emotions that humankind experience: fear and love 
While other emotions branch either directly or indirectly from these two emotions
Fear has a long and slow frequency vibration to it {*tone dies down*} 
While love has a very rapid and high frequency
{*tone rises again as it becomes a whirling noise while flying by*}

[Erykah Badu]
