Song:   Another Leaf
Typed by: Young Tob

another day carves a line into my face 
the writing's on the wall, it's a losing race 
and I can't say goodbyes 
whispers 
fall upon my ear like the rain on a summer's day 
there's nowhere left to play 
listen 
to the sound of the time ticking away 
and I can't make it stay 

it's not as if the world revolves around me 
I'm just another leaf that falls from the tree 
hoping that I might get caught in the wind 
before that autumn begins 
not as if the world revolves around me 
just another leaf that falls from the tree 
hoping that I might get caught in the wind 
before that autumn begins 

watching the sunset come quick over 
the sky wishing for one minute more 
the moments are gone by the morning 
what's in it for me? 
beauty starts running before we 
ever can touch it, gone in a hurry 
confronting the worry 
happy endings are unfinished stories 
trying to perfect the past 
can't forget regrets I have 
clinging to what's left of passions 
fading away cause stress attached 
gets there faster 
when peaks are high and depths are vast 
what success I have 
could ever match it? 
it's funny how the time goes by 
like I'm covered with a blindfold I 
discovered through those child eyes 
that some of us might decide to 
give up our love ones to a 9 to 5 
in the struggle to provide 
and love is the survival for confronting all the irony 
of life...just trying to keep my head above the water 
forgetting my tomorrows looking to next week 
for a path that's a better one to follow 
my words are my sunrise 
looking in my future son's eyes 
trying to let him see my portrait 
to remedy everything before it 

floating in the wind 
floating in the wind 
floating in the wind 
floating in the wind</pre>
