Mira, mira, mira, mira, mira
Mira, mira, mira, mira, mira
Mira, mira, mira, mira, mira
Mira, mira, yo quiero

Cuban girls, Cuban girls, I like em
Puerto Rican girls, Puerto Rican girls, yo quiero
Mexican girls, Mexican girls, yo quiero
Spanish girls, the Spanish girls, I like them
Girls, girls, Latin girls, Latin girls, Latin girls, Latin girls
What's happenin' girls, what's happenin' girls, what's happenin'

I like Latin, them Latin women (I do)
And they love me cos I'm that man
With coconuts and chocolate skin
I'm that mocha masculine
Feminine's that are Latin, call your friends
And call your cousins cos I know you got dozens of them
Maria's, Elizabeth's, Sonia's and Blanca's
When I see you, you can get boned if you want ta
Yo quiero en I'm sincero
If you never had an ichi let me be your primero
We can hit the channel we can dance the bolero
Have a shopping spree and you can spend my dinero
But, I wish you was more like J-Lo
Cos love don't cost a thing (my love don't cost)
So why don't you let this king love the queen of Argentine
Girl you know I know you know what I mean
Cos I like them

Cuban girls, Cuban girls, I like em
Puerto Rican girls, Puerto Rican girls, yo quiero
Mexican girls, Mexican girls, yo quiero
Spanish girls, the spanish girls, I like em
Girls, girls, Latin girls, Latin girls, Latin girls
You're making me hot girl, what's happenin' girls
What's happenin', whoa

Que honda, que quieres con mi
Mira muchacha esto es para ti
Latina, chicana por mi
Mas finas me gusta me a si
Mira ah, mira ah, mira ah, mami
Esperate, esperate, esperate aqui
We could connect and act humanly
Indulge in animal instincts so we
We can have conversation or, sexual relation
Or, we could explore, find out more
Bout things that we've done before
Whether it be kinky thoughts
I'm a make your chonies drop
Watch Mr. Shorty rock, I'll make your sticky spot
Hombre Lumbre gonna make you hot
I'll make you drip drop, they call me come-a-lot, I like em

Cuban girls, Cuban girls, I like em
Puerto Rican girls, Puerto Rican girls, yo quiero
Mexican girls, Mexican girls, yo quiero
Spanish girls, the spanish girls, I like em
Girls, girls, Latin girls, Latin girls, Latin girls, Latin girls
What's happenin' girls, what's happenin' girls, what's happenin'

*Spanish Singing* 
(Ven a mi, paraiso sera para tira ti, sera para ti
Sentiras el fuego dentro de mi sed)
 
Yo, Latin girls, Latin girls, Latin girls, Latin girls
Que pasa señorita, you a brown skin mama
Me llamo Manzana, wanna take you to Havana
We could get down everyday of the semana
Dance to the musica and follow the guitarra
Clap, clap, clap, come on

Dame un momento y luego con un beso
Take you to Phillipines and you don't have to spend a peso

We got connection like a novel to a reader
I can related cos Latin girls look Phillipina
Check your history, there's no mystery between us
Destiny made it possible to be us
I know about your culture cuase it's mixed with mine
We got together well, just like beats and rhymes
And Tequilas and limes, and Celeste with pine
And I'll say it one more time, I like them

Cuban girls, Cuban girls, I like em
Puerto Rican girls, Puerto Rican girls, yo quiero
Mexican girls, Mexican girls, yo quiero
Spanish girls, the spanish girls, I like em
Girls, girls, Latin girls, Latin girls, Latin girls, Latin girls
What's happenin' girls, what's happenin' girls, what's happenin'

Yeah, I like 'em, yo quiero, yo quiero, I like 'em

{*Spanish singing*}
(Dame un poquito mas lo que tienes por ahi
Porque contigo yo quiero bailar
... Contigo yo quiero, bailar un bolero, señor caballero
Dame dame dame... dame amor 
Contigo yo quiero. Papito.)
