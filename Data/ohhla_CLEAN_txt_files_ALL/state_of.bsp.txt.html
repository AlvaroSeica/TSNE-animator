I'm in a state of yo
So if I go to the spliff that I passed
Mix it back with the slack from my man
With a tan sitting by the fan
In a heavy, heavy band
The beat, huh, feels warm, and cool
Won't fall
Just groove, soothe it, shmooth it
Ahhh, shit and I won't quit
Keep on, and on and on
Filling up the gap from eve to dawn
Gotta be the Sheep
Under your nose, above your head
Honey said '69', I thought of boots
And gave her pro-Keds
D for action, just like Jackson
Cause the jacksons are not imagined
I don't really wanna give a foot, you know
I'm in a state of yo, so what if I go..

Yo, days go by, we just get flyer
Swinging harder cause we got desire
Extra effort because we're tryers
Got more heat than a dollar in the dryer
Got more flavour than Fruity Pebbles
Check the format and clock the levels
Yo Â­ do what you gotta do..
Cause I got more style than store that's dapper
Got more sweet than a candy wrapper
Got more, balls than a pimp who slaps
And got heart like a thug that maps
Make more sense than childhood freaks
Got more support than high-top kicks
So what's happens in the mix
I'm weak yet pure like a heroin fix
So, yo, don't you know that the flow
That I just move on, just like so
It's got me in a, state of ..

Yo, no aggre-ssion
Let your mind make connec-tion
Ain't no need for correc-tion
Yo, huh? Oh, on with the session
Heavies got some weight, you can't debate
Elate the fate, cause the style is great
For life is hectic and all that there
People, you care but, yo, beware
For one knows not what gets one shot
I think I used to know but I forgot
Cause it ain't nothing, nothing at all
I'm telling you it's a small..
Without the faith for things that work
To spite my life is to spite your birth
We share the earth, yo, but who was first, yo?
So, who's here now, yo? Well, where's my hearse, yo
But I gotta go, I gotta go
To where I don't, I don't, I don't know
I guess I'll just hang out in a state of yo</pre>
