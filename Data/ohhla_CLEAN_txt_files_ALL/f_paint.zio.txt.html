[Verse 1 - Zion]
Feel my finger paint
Color to stimulate ya
Rise relate ya
Pass in love and nature
Rhymes to break ya, take ya
Up to the maker
Away from the pain
We feelin safer
The liberate to rectify the soul
Written in red, green, black
Trim it with gold
We been in war
Hey man we seen it all before
Got you feeling the fundamentals of flow toe-to-toe
How we battle
You can light the shadow
Walking with
You bring a barrage of marshmallow
Yellow
Words and word curse
Lip style mellow
Zion the lion-hearted fellow
Bellow
Finger paint you can hold the weight
When the mind is great, then the soul create
I reperate like I'm water when I change my state
Mindscape to the next levitate

[Chorus]
Breakin all the shit that I don't want to hold
Makin all the slumbers inside me flow
So in all the seasons can make me grow
And I'm breathing
I'm breathing slow

[Pre-Verse - Zion]
Breathe In...Out

[Verse 2 - DUST]
Feel my finger paint as the world spins
Let my finger paint cleanse your sins
My finger's paintin' all colors on your skin
See my reflection in my brother, my twin
I'm sparkin' a light to your soul deep within
You can hear the echo when I drop my pen
The children hold hands under the rainbow
Everywhere we go we bring the same flow
Feel my finger-paint on my parabola
Supernovas, nebulas, satellites
My finger's paintin' all over the mic
My finger's paintin' lightning when it strikes
Bring down the rain, release the pain
Master the craft, die ya rocks ya game
My fingers paint across all terrain
My finger paint penetrates your brain

[Chorus til end]
Breakin all the shit that I don't want to hold
Makin all the slumbers inside me flow
So in all the seasons can make me grow
And I'm breathin
I'm breathing slow</pre>
