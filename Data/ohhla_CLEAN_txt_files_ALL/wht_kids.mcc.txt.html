[Brak in background]
White kids love hip hop...
White kids love hip hop...

[Verse 1]
White kids love hip hop and disc jocks
Go-carts and fist fights
Gettin' drunk on Bud then gettin' high like a pitch pipe
Are you an MC Chris type?
A hip hop lovin' half pint?
Then just turn on your heartlight
A bunsen burner barfly
This is our time, blast it from the boombox
Liberate the goondocks, saw your cousin in a....a tube top
Bust a nugget in a....a tube sock
It's 2pac, it's Big Pop, it's hip hop, it don't stop
I love that song, I love that groove, motherfucker
Well I can't help but move, so if you don't mind
If it's alright with you
I'm gonna get in the electric slide line just to prove that

[Hook]
White kids love hip hop
White kids love hip hop
White kids love hip hooooooop
Oooooohhhhhh

[Verse 2]
White kids love hip hop and axel, tractors and Rambo
Playin' Unreal Tournament with infinite ammo
Taggers and vandals in black socks and sandals
Doin' as many drugs as they can motherfuckin' handle
Skippin' school, breakin' rules and flippin' the bird
Fast food cartoons after 'ittin' some 'erb
Freakin' them flirts, makin' 'em purr till it hurts
Just a couple of nerds clockin' the curbs
A couple a words about my 'nilla wiggas
Packin' peters that are measured in millimeters
We don't talk in the theaters like we're Siskel and Ebert
We drink box wine and we listen to Weezer

[Hook]
White kids love hip hop
White kids love hip hop
White kids love hip hooooooop
Oooooohhhhhh

[Outro - Brak]
Man there's nothin' to do in this stupid town
Rope swing's busted, stinkin' cops always kickin' me outta the park
Manager of the 7-11 always says
"Get off my curb you good for nothin'"
All the girls already know I'm a bad kisser
So they won't come anywhere near me
I don't know how many times I been TGIF
A kid can eat an onion bloom only so many times
Bowling's boring, the skating rink's been taken over by 12 year olds
There ain't no good movies out
Blockbuster never has any good games in
I don't wanna play Bombad Racing
I mean, what the heck is that?
I'm sick of all my records
And every time I walk into a record store I forget what I wanna get
And there ain't nothin' on TV, not a stupid thing
There ain't nothin' to do except take naps
And wait paitently for death!

White kids love hip hop
White kids love hip hop
White kids love hip hoooooopppp
White....ohhhh bullshit</pre>
