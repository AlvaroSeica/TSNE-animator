[Chamillionaire]
See there's a big difference between them and me
They're loud, and obnoxious, you know
The type to do a lot of yellin in the crowded parkin lot
The guys that never really do much of nothin
Me? I'm the one in the background
The quiet one, the deadly one, the one you gotta worry about
You can just call me, your connect
As long as nobody gets outta line everything'll be just fine
So listen - I got a proposition
See, it's time to cut out the middleman
Matter of fact, send my condolences to the little man
I gave you plenty for free
Now I'm givin you a skeet taste of additional product
You sit with it, you come back, I'll give you a higher grade
You put it out on the streets for me
Untapped, untouched, uncut raw
Anybody can give it away for free
but there's value in gettin them to buy
That's how you know you're worth it 
and that's the difference between them and me
You're my new distributor, and I'm your connect
If you don't accept this offer you have 20 seconds to press eject
My trap house, Chamillionaire.com
This is where you come and get your "Ammunition"
You get it directly, from me
Remember the rules
Only speak on the dead phone and only call me on the red phone
And by the way, when you see the middleman {*gun cocks*}
Give him a gift {*silencer gunshot and a body drops*}
From your connect
