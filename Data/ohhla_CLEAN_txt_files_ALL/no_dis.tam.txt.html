[Missy]
Ay yo, see I'm your next girl
Not your ex-girl boo, uh
Don't get it twisted
Don't never disrespect me

[Tamar](Missy)
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh yeah (Uh, uh, uh)
Don't, don't you ever compare me
To none of those hoes you used to mess with
(Say what?)
Cause those are some low down dirty tricks
And now you be working with some new shit
I'll be the mother of your baby
If you bring me down I can handle it (Uh-huh)
Cause I'm not like those other ladies (Uh)
None of them hoes you be fucking with

1  [Tamar]
    I'm not your hoe
    I'm not your freak
    I'm not your trick
    But I'm naturally beautiful
    High quality
    I'm tired of you disrespecting me

Repeat 1

[Tamar](Missy)
(One-two)
Don't, don't you ever dare treat me
Like them chickens you be playing with (Uh-huh)
Cause I am more than a lady
And those the type of chicks who be dirty shit
They look at you lying and persuading
You play innocent believe it (Uh-huh)
Cause I'm not like those other ladies (Say, say what?)
None of the chicks you be fucking with (Uh)

Repeat 1 (2x)

[Missy]
There will be no disrespecting me, me
There will be no disrespecting me, me

Repeat 1 (4x)

2  [Missy]
    I'm not your hoe

Repeat 2
