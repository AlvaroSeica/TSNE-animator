[Shawn Wigs]
Top of the line, watch me just polish my nine
36, on my 45, wrist to grind
You wanna bet, but you just can't cover the small prime
Rain or shine, life still filled with crimes
Smoke blunts, roll like four or five dimes
Good times, watch me get girls of all kind
Watch 'em, crown me the 45 King of rhymes
I shit rhymes, flow like the air I breath, I'm so
Stuck on these streets, that they wish I leave
Non-believe, got so many tricks up my sleeve
I got to chuck my wallies, before I leave to the bees
None to achieve, boy, you start hating on the kid
Run around, tellin' everyone, the shit I did
I broke my bank, took it, and I washed it clean
I got my bank g's looking they ain't even green
They counterfeit, feds rushed me on account of it
Thinking I'm printing up cash, how they sound and shit?

"Let's see how they like my energy ray!"</pre>
