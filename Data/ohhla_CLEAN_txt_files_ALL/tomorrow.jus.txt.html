[Verse 1]
I'm almost out of love, I have very little to spare
Last nigga that I killed was in the middle of prayer
I'm god, so you think that I would probably care
Truth is I fucking hate y'all I solemnly swear
I could give a fuck if you die, no I'm not saving your lives
I never find it hard saying good-byes, there's water under the bridge
Never under my eyes, the only thing that gets wiped is the blood off knifes
There's nothing, you niggazlack purpose, yoi fucking worthless
I decided the earth, no longer needs your services
You never heard a god more fucking virtuous
What other job you egt paid for being merciless
What's the odds of you ever reaching perfectness?
Before allah, puts you on the "missing-persons" list
Permenantly so the body never surfaces
My policy: no accept return purchases

[Chorus]
tomorrow never comes
3X
from the burbs to the slums
tomorrow never comes
2X
whether you got a 9 to 5 or you hustling gums
tomorrow never comes
3X
when you out for the ones
tomorrow never comes
2X
I'ma stay up with the rest of the suns suns

[Verse 2]
I hope you niggaz aint scared, you can bet ya fucking life we're not
you never never talk shit with allah in earshot
not a fuckin word you niggaz remain tightlipped
like whips so get your motherfuckin life stripped
one tenth, your body drops and your soul lifts
poles shift, life and death have their roles switched
how's it feel on the opposite side of the coin
hell has offered you the option of finally joining
might as well, noone here' will stop you from going
'cept your own fucking fear obviously showing
not even in your fuckin dreams could you touch the supremes
my level of mean add another fuckin extreme
I'll destroy your esteem like nothing you've seen
you get your fuckin clock cleaned, take one for the team
Bet your motherfuckin ears have nothing beween
You sold your green for a couple of beans

[Chorus]
tomorrow never comes
3X
from the burbs to the slums
tomorrow never comes
2X
whether you got a 9 to 5 or you hustling gums
tomorrow never comes
3X
when you out for the ones
tomorrow never comes
2X
I'ma stay up with the rest of the suns suns

[Verse 3]
Versus allah? yall corny motherfuckers sound repetetive
Its safe to say, Im the smartest man thats ever lived
I am negative, I will kill a relative
Real competitive, raised with the devil's kids
Look in the barrel of a pistol where the metal is
Let me show you were my sickel and my shovel is
I created death, I know you pray in jest
To live after your no longer in your fuckin flesh

[Chorus]</pre>
