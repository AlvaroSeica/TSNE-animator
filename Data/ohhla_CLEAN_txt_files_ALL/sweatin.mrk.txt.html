Typed by: timm2014@hotmail.com

[Chorus] [x8]
Stop sweatin' me
"Tic toc ya don't stop"

[Verse One]
Sweating me
Leaving me
Drenched
Caught up in the stench of the high
I'm not the type to front like I'm the overnight fo' sho' shot
Ra got more knots, many never know not
What?
Lick the sweat off me butt
Rasta's in galoshes 
Sprayin' Dior antiperspirant 
It'll be no worse when
?
Simply blinded by the glare of a star from afar
A c'mon y'all
I'm cool as a fan
Sweat me like a gland
I can tell you're workin' but would you really understand

[Chorus] [x8]
Stop sweatin' me
"Tic toc ya don't stop"

[Verse Two]
Now undercover friends that seemed to sneak back into my life
Yeah, after my days of livin' trife
Mistafiss ain't the one though
So I had to play 'em like a game of Nintendo
First they tried to diss the
Now they pissed the
Mistafissta
They irritating like a blister
Oh why?
I don't know
You get's none from this man
I thought I'd let you know

[Bridge] [x2]
We gonna come into your town
You're gonna look and stare us down
You wanna sweat the Q&amp;A
Hey, hey it's okay

[Chorus] [x8]
Stop sweatin' me
"Tic toc ya don't stop"

[Verse Three]
Now me, I, see my friends that want to be my
Friend (Raise your hand if you're Sure)
Now I don't really wanna seem I'm all that
(Mystical to magical, really they so happy to
Run across this thing that we call the biz)
Now why would you sweat the Rasta like a sauna?

[Chorus] [x8]
Stop sweatin' me
"Tic toc ya don't stop"

Sometimes I wonder [x12]

[Bridge] [x2]
We gonna come into your town
You're gonna look and stare us down
You wanna sweat the Q&amp;A
Hey, hey it's okay

"Tic toc ya don't stop"</pre>
