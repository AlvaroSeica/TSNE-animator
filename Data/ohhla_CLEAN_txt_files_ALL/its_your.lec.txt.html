[Verse One]
I know I'm not fit or deserving to do this
But I'm foolish
If I don't spit to give you Godly influence
Like a student
Practise and prudence will you walk with me through this
As I give my feeble attempt at glorifying Yeshua
Cause he
Is the beginning everything came into being
By his being the being who created all other beings
We're MCing
Due to his benevolent freeing, decreeing
he's the almighty creator of everything that we're seeing
There is none like him, if you don't like him
then he'll use the liking of liking himself to acquire just to delight him
That's why I write hymns
My right hand use to write sin battle 'gainst him like I was Shaolin
And now despite sin
I give praise the God who made sunny days
To white lightening
It's quite frightening
To sing "Who's world is this" without proper enlightenment

[Verse Two]
He use intellegent design
Like eloquence confined
Life elements assigned by
Elohim my God
he left his fingerprints
You thinking that our origins are coincidence
Our cemetary alone makes evolution look ridiculous
And since our complexity is more than irreducible
The fact our design had a designer is irrefutable
I use science too to make a statement like this
The existence of an atheist proves God exists
he's the owner
holding the throne
Potent and strong
he smote any foe approaching him on bolens alone
But since he up-rose he told us to go on this road
Shown my a knowledge foretold
Spoken by prophets of old
The total opposite role
Chosen by populace goes
Down to the hottest abode
Total apocalypse bro
That's why we're rocking it yo
hand these sounds to the proudest man
God has brought you in this world and he can sure take you out of it

[Verse Three]
You should already know who's running it
Brotha you don't want it
he made it in six but he'll only take one to crumble it
The earth rumbles at the sound of his mumbling
he flooded it once but with Noah he made a covenant
So the next time he's gonna be coming with flames
his antagonists don't know what they're up against
Return of the last Adam who's rapping will smash men now holds together every last atom
And that ain't even the sum of it
Matter of fact you could handle the half I'm only giving you some of it
But it's still enough of it for you to come to grips
With the fact that it's his planet you own none of it
So please consider how dumb it is
To take comfort in the momentary status you have and the stuff you get
he'll blaze it up in the end you can trust it kid
But we ain't bugging cause there's another one coming you dig

[Verse Four]
The earth was so impressed with his defeat of the grave
The ground did the harlem shake the ocean did the wave
No longer enslaved now that I see the Lord
And God is so deep he causes hurricanes when he brainstorms
I switched teams me and Crae got traded on the same night
Same conference same sermon by James White
The light of Christ is a blazing one
I'm evidence that his Grace is amazing son
Man continues to overvalue his worth
Spends most of his time trying to conquer the earth
That kind of action only leaves you empty or hurt
Then you see your true value when you return to the dirt
Five thousand dollar casket, five hundred dollar clothes
Six months for the grieving, one year to decompose
I've yet to find a human who can outlive the curse
While God sits in the heaven, place his feet on the Earth </pre>
