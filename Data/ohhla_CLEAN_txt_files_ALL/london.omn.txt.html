I don't think I wanna go to work today
if anybody calls say I'm m.i.a
call me when you got something goodto say
I aint taking no orders from you today
not today, I'm not your slave
mrs. boss lady better up my pay
she don't wanna see me when I'm up in her face
cause imma throw a fit till I get my way

just when we thought the world was over
don't nobody wanna hear that sound
get the lord on the phone, come get me
I said some bullshit is going down

when we gonna heal our nation
and put an end to starvation
they flying planes into buildings
suicide bombers killing innocent civilians

london lives, long live london
new york city to the london bridge (x2)

when we break them chains what it sound like
freedom, freedom, freedom, freedom (x2)

I know it aint easy, single parent and them babies need feeding
holidays coming and them ends aint meetin'.
phones ringing off the hook, them bills aint leaving
the father aint there, don't care, don't need um
all he ever does is get drunk and beat um
you gave us all something to believe in
and made us all feel like we had a reason
forever young, living off the beat of the drum
we celebrate the someone that comes
I breathe deep and exhale the smoke from my lungs
its intense, theres nothing I can stand against
my defense, I grew accustom to muslim reasons
the streets are bleeding, souls need feeding
all around the world it's the same old story
the hunger, the struggle, the battle, the glory

just when we thought the world was over
don't nobody wanna hear that sound
get the lord on the phone, come get me
I said some bullshit is going down

when we break them chains what it sound like
freedom, freedom, freedom, freedom (x2)

london lives, long live london
NEW YORK CITY TO THE LONDON BRIDGE (X8)</pre>
