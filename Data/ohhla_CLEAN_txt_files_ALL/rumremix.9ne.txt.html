Must be the chronic, nah FUCK THAT
New track, new rap, that's how I'm comin at you black
One for the incredible, original
Lyrical, spiritual, buddha blessed it, manifested
with Development, but not Arrested
Highly intellectual, with the inner flesh shit
I'm hittin like the raindrops, fallin from skies
when God cries, as the chosen man on stolen land dies
Eyeees red, from inhalin herbs from cannabis plants
The need for many grands got me scramblin like ants
I'm like, Underdog, in a world of cats
Too many to chase, so I own many gats
I'm the Nine with the tongue like a dragon
Braids on my head on the regular, pants saggin
toes I be taggin, I'm raggin, rappers, suckers
I rock more jams Smuckers, stompin like chuckers
Motherfuckers know my style, my steelo
I flip like a kilo
I'm sicker than a ham and cheese hero
No shame in my game up my sleeves no types of tricks
This is Redrum the Remix!

There's still 99 bottles of beer on the wall, and
still it takes two niggaz to drink them all
Yes y'all I crawl and creep, jump out of a Jeep
Pull you off your feet, leave you in the street, incomplete
like dat, I'm ill for the dollar bill I will kill
on the hill in Brownsville, and blow your ass to Peteskil
Chill, until we show love for real
I only trust my steel, I ain't the one to peel with the raw deal
Sometimes a psycho, never let the mic go
I flow like the blood in Nile when Moses went buckwild
So don't mess sonny, you dummy
Your rap style is crummy, my voice is dirty and bummy
Your honey, is checkin me now, I'm on the prowl
So money, let me hold her for a little while
I'll send her back, cause I ain't keepin no hoe who wants my dough
Met her at my show I bust her drawers on the down low

Lord have mercy, I heard you wan' jerk me
But you cyan't do dat, son I thought you knew that
My style is wicked, feelin the potential
Switchin up my flow and fuckin with your mental
Me non-stop, until me rule hip-hop, BLAOW BLOAW
Me non-stop until me rule hip-hop
Me non-stop, until me rule hip-hop, BLAOW BLOAW
Me non-stop until me rule hip-hop
Cease and seckle with the blood clot cryin
Let me take a verse from the one Mad Lion
"Too many suckers, and not eonugh time
 to buck em all down with one clip from me nine"
Me comin a one, me comin a two, me comin a three, me comin a four
Me comin to rip, me comin to kick, me comin to stick down your door
REMEMBER.. to let me in when I come in
or else get a taste of Redrum
