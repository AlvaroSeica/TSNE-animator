[Intro: Dom Pachino]
Niggas talking this, niggas talking that
Man, get the fucking story right, man, shut the fuck up
You don't know what you talking bout
Yanahmean, and I'm Dom P., by the way if you ain't know my name, nigga

[Chorus: Dom Pachino]
Lotta speculations on the niggas I stuck, and bitches I fucked
Is that nigga really real, is the jewelry really truck
Niggas that slept on, didn't knowledge my weap-on
Thought I was another, nigga that they could step on
Niggas I stuck, and bitches I fucked
Is that nigga really real, is the jewelry really truck
Niggas that slept on, didn't knowledge my weap-on
Thought I was another, nigga that they could step on

[Dom Pachino]
Hear me out, if I didn't have this gun in your mouth
Would you really hear me out?
Think not, but when I came in the spot
With the things out, niggas was getting popped, BONG
One by one, shine til the son's job is done
And that'll be never, so count my funds
While I, just drink my drink
I'm in the house, bitches, just look at my link
Ching, cuz the shine so bright
And when I leave, she's with me at the end of the night
Why, cuz my chips stacked up
I got her lips on my dick, in the back of my truck
Mmmm, I'm the one that they love to hate
I got one question, why they still speculate

[Chorus]

[Dom Pachino]
Is it a conspiary theory, or niggas just fear me
Cuz everytime I come around, they don't wanna be near me
And more than one bitch'll want me, so I just let them share me
They want to feature me with M.C.'s, but they never compare me
I got rhyme stacks, longer than the lake of Erie
I got bars that get felt like 2Pac's 'Hail Mary', you hear me?
That's not half of my stash
Don't make have to spit some shit that I wrote in my past
I'm kind of bugged, considered a thug
Stuck niggas, leave 'em curdled up and they pockets dug

[Chorus]

[Dom Pachino]
I'm the Don, call me Magic Juon
The way the ladies huddled up, curdled under my arm
Yeah, I'm a freak, before the Delta Force goochie sneaks
Bitch, couldn't fuck with the kid, the kid was at his peak, please
Don't even blink and shit
I might snatch ya muthafuckin' link and shit
Talking bout being iced out, and shit like that
Muthafucka, go through my hood and be like that
In inherit ya lifestyle, wouldn't be like that
What... it just be like that...

[Chorus]

[Outro: Dom Pachino]
Yeah, yeah, game extortion
Staten Island, what up?
It's Dom P., nigga
Repping to the fullest...
No more speculations...</pre>
