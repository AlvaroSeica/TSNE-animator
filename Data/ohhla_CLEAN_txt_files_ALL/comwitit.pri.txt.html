First Verse (Ms. Tee):

I want me a hot nigga,
That's not afraid to pull the trigger,
I want one with big nuts,
That's not afraid to give it up,
A Hot Boy that got game,
A Hot Boy that got a name,
I want one that love to bang,
Someone I can fuck and change,
I want me a soldier,
That's why I'm lookin' in that Nolia,
Off top, you thought I forgot?
I want a Gert-Town nigga in a drop top,
So you know, I wanna get blowed,
And fuck with them niggas outta Holly Grove,
Calliope niggas be creepin',
Better watch them hot niggas when they sneakin'

Chorus (Ms. Tee):

They some, Hot Boys, rollin' in the city,
Ridin' round town and you know they comin' wit it
They some, Hot Boys, rollin' in the city,
Ridin' round town and you know they comin' wit it
They some, Hot Boys, rollin' in the city,
Ridin' round town and you know they comin' wit it
They some, Hot Boys, rollin' in the city,
Ridin' round town and you know they comin' wit it

Second Verse (Prime Time):

Should've heard them clowns sang "Put your solja rag up",
Should have heard them hounds sang "Put them mole rag up",
But I mean what the fuck I say,
And I mean what the fuck I mean,
Always do the job clean with the uzi machine,
But I'm tough in the clutch,
I'm a Bad Boy like Poppa and Puff,
On a job like Starsky and Hutch,
Steady playin' hatin' us, better get your shit tight,
Better learn how to write and stop out'chea tryin' to bite,
Steady dealin' with the hype,
But not tonight I'm bustin' loops,
But I choose I use, cuz I can't get bruised,
But ask somebody that know they say Prime is a fool,
I choose to be a fool to take you bitches to school,
Since you a Hot Boy, off top I know you not,
You thinkin' V.L.'s the shit?
You must be on donuts and dicks,
My clique we be hella thick,
And let that K spit bitch,
Gettin' rowdy?  I doubt it,
Prime Time and I'm out it
