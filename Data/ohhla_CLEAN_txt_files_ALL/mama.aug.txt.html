Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
Mama said stay out of trouble
Mama said don't be a fool
Mama said stay in somebody's church
Mama said boy stay in school
Mama told me I better get home, before the street lights come on
Mama always use to cry when I left her
Maybe cause daddy was gone
I still remember the lessons my mama taught me
But now it's my turn to show you how far they brought me

[Chorus]
Mama I made it, ahhhh yeaaah
Mama I made it
I could of been locked up,
I could of been gunned down but I found my own way
I ain't gonna stop now cause mama I made it
And I hope I made you proud

[Verse 2]
Mama said stay humble
Mama said stay true
Mama said boy keep that drama far away from you
Mama told me keep working
Busting on to the future
Mama told me she lost one and she ain't tryna lose two
But I had to find my way, and I had to get my own
Mama ain't always right, but she never let me round
I don't know if Ima make it big, mama but I made it out
I know I didn't make it easy, I know you had your doubts
I still remember the lessons my mama taught me
But now it's my turn to show you how far they brought me

[Chorus x2]
Mama I made it, ahhhh yeaaah
Mama I made it
I could of been locked up,
I could of been gunned down but I found my own way
I ain't gonna stop now cause mama I made it
And I hope I made you proud</pre>
