Album:  Rise Up
Song:   Come One Come All
Typed by: noof

Question: when's the last time you touched essence?
Reflect it, 3 minutes and some seconds
Who these rap cats you repping?
With stars in they flag?
When's the last time you checked it?
Me? I go switch your poetic perspective
Rim to pimp brims with electric chair Texas
Nigger touched up like perms for perfection
Permanent damage don't dance on my records
Have sex and more babies
Beau young and restless
Protest mine cos I rolled a death sentence
Resurrect epics with stars suns and crescents
7's with circles broke into 4 sections, yeah
That's ahead of most heads who don't listen
Mafia children alive with tradition
Fingers have visions
Every song scriptured, it's simply a seance
But not ghost written! Ah ...
Azeem is ill man, listen
Kick it with strippers and thieves like the first christians
The prince - ya'll amateurs, you can't do this
Throw a box of records at the block, they'd still miss
I shift focus, quote my ribs
Still hungry, no jokes where the cheekbones is
The speed changes sequence my beats got fists
Raised on tough titties naw we don't snitch!
My mind's a neighbourhood and rhymes paint pictures
Of castles and riches and statues of sisters
Tall story buildings: it's a nice place to visit
Don't record it to my cut-throat district, come on.

Refrain

This is a space opera, Chakra shocker
Black anthrax, a style monster
A proud sponsor, strapped back with armour
Peace -   I harvest words, I'm a farmer
10 more steps ahead we move forward
Dog I'm organised like Black August
Songs are fortified, we all lawless
I'll see 45 before charges
If this is just my time, I can't call it
Go out with half the squad and plus the sergeant
Living like a million years of promise
Calmly cause a riot - keep performing
Warning - this is noise and plus poison
Avoiding the rapture, relax and enjoy it
Annoying the toy in you, that's what the point is
Life's a bitch tough tits but enjoy it, come on!

Refrain

I'm a Saint - why?
Cos I paint lines
Make pages cry when the ink dries
Straight before your eyes I create lines
Fame beyond the name of the grapevine
Plain and simple pain so we kill time
With stranger took cocaine but I will lie
This is not a game it's a real crime
A freak of nature thing that I still shine
Specific - compare me to who? That's a sickness
They wrists too thin for this
They won't risk it
I throw fits and vocal mission district
Rich in non-fiction, god's most gifted
Pull out your microchip you're shit's glitching
Music (drug-induced) causes visions
Beats that Zeph produced, you're just tripping
Turn up the music fool and quit bitching!</pre>
