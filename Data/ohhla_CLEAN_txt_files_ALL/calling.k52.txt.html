Song:   Calling You
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Each and every time I call
Each and every time I fall
You will get me through it all
Even if I'm against the wall

Now I was like LOL
You hit me w/ a call but it wasn't on a cell
I went and got ya voice mail
Right at the times when all the choice failed
I was heading right towards hell
Laughing like ROFL
I couldn't even find self
But you hit me on back like TTYL
And yet I still keep stressing this
You still keep sending ya text messages
And then I read all ya sentences
66 books broke down in 2 testaments
And then I started to make sense of this
Understood now what the lesson is
You got me standing on the precipice
Will I call you w/ the hopes that ya getting this saying

So you still calling me
But I hit you on back like BRB
You said believe on me
And I couldn't miss that like some neon green
It was all beyond me
Yet I'm still playing games like it's 3 on 3
You said lean on me
Just call out my name like OMG
Now before I see death
Ya better write back soon like WBS
I couldn't see what's next
So stressed you was like did you read the text
When it comes down to sin
We just get owned like PWN
But since I got a new best friend
Its BFF all the way to the end so I say..</pre>
