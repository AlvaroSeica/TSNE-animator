[Kid Ink]
I see ya, ahhh ahh I see ya
Uhh, yeaa, I said you fukkin wit the man girl
Uhhhhhh wat you sayin girl
Tell em

[Chorus]
[Kid Ink]
Yu lookin the type
Know jus how to move it
Don't be so up tight
Ain't no need for choosin
Gon' take it down fo' a nigga like me
and Ima turn you out baby girl
Before we leave here
Drop it to the floor
Let me see you lose it
Gettin to the music
Why you sittin clueless
Gon' take it down fo' a nigga like me
and Ima turn you out baby girl
Before we leave here, yea

[Kid Ink]
Look around and I can spot you through the crowd
Its gotta be yu
Catch the way you throw it out
and take it down
Like you copy written
Them other pussies copycatting and ain't nobody care
Wit you babe, all the games you play
Stop that and come and give me sugar like kool-aid
Up all night
Its never too late
Jus wanna lock that pussy down like boozay
Uhh they say who's he
Young nigga wit a money tree
Bouquet
Trying throw it all over your bootayy
That body on fire
Souffl√©
and them lips is lookin so made

[Chorus]
[Kid Ink]
Yu lookin the type
Know jus how to move it
Dont be so up tight
Aint no need for choosin
Gon' take it down fo' a nigga like me
and Ima turn you out baby girl
Before we leave here
Drop it to the floor
Let me see you lose it
Gettin to the music
Why you sittin clueless
Gon' take it down fo' a nigga like me
and Ima turn you out baby girl
Before we leave here

[Kirko Bangz]
Uhh sippin on that pimp juice
Money in my pocket
Tell me wats new
Had dreams of that bentley coupe
Till I copped it now my hood know I'm that nigga who
Gotta lotta money
Gotta lotta things
Grip alotta grain
I know, they talkin now
But I'm walkin 'round
Wit a double cup and I'm poured
Say why you so up tight
Girl you jus my type
and I might be that nigga
But only for tonight
Now shawty break it down for me
Shawty take it down
Lay it down fo' a g
and I might give her anything
That she want from me
As long as she get down
Take it real low for me

[Chorus]
[Kid Ink]
Yu lookin the type
Know jus how to move it
Don't be so up tight
Ain't no need for choosin
Gon' take it down fo' a nigga like me
and Ima turn you out baby girl
Before we leave here
Drop it to the floor
Let me see you lose it
Gettin to the music
Why you sittin clueless
Gon' take it down fo' a nigga like me
and Ima turn you out baby girl
Before we leave here, yea

Down, down
Take it down
Baby girl before we leave here
Down down
Come right over I got everything you need, yea</pre>
