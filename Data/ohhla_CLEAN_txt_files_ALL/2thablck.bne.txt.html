[Intro: Bizzy]
Rewind that shit (yeah)
The top, to to, the top (yeah yeah, one time, Mob Life)
We goin to, the top, to to, the top (uhh, one time for they mind)
We goin to, the block, to to, the block (on top of the world)
We goin to, the block, to to, the block (c'mon baby)

[Chorus: Bizzy Bone]
Baby let me tell ya just exactly where we goin wit it
To, the top, to to, the top
We goin to, the top, to to, the top
We goin to, the top, to to, the tooooop
Baby let me tell ya just exactly where we goin wit it
To, the block, to to, the block
We goin to, the block, to to, the block
We goin to, the block, to to, the block

[Bizzy Bone]
Hey Mrs. in my business, wannabe publicist, huh? (we goin)
Callin my people, tryin to get info from her
I don't even know ya, can't even speak to ya heart
You are just a demon, can't even peep anyone
Hey Ms. computer hacker, you got no husband to love
Talkin it ain't your man and (shhhh) shit you just need you a hug
You 57, tryin to hang with the young
Hey little pagan woman, you just a girl in my world, no
Quit callin family, I'm on my damny, y'know
You bother my brother, yeah, brother Aeileon
Aeileon Capone, so sick of hearin your voice
That he puts you on mute, and continue to grind with boys
Hey Ms. computer hacker, hey Mrs. slacker in school-a
You're needin your teacher, I'm slappin you with my ruler
You could never fool us, and never do us so dumb
that we believe in you, you know where we come from, come from
I hear you callin, we don't owe you no damn money
And all the whole crew I fired was done, cause they was phony
As we rise again, you can't surmise on this wise
It ain't no waltzin in, no matter complainin or cryin (c'mon!) 

[Chorus] w/ minor variations

[Bizzy Bone]
Yeah that's what I'm talkin 'bout baby

Let me tell ya super-size my fries, my sandwich is boca
Got a problem with my brother, don't you fuck with Que Loco
Smoke ya, out of yo' panties, and out of yo' 'hose
And choke ya, out of yo' nooks and your crannies and even the foes
Give 'em the swift blow, blow, Bizzy Bone's my name
Allah my master I'm your slave, please keep me safe in this game
So as they run and tryin to sabotage our goal and our aim
They tryin to defame, and frame, but the real family remains
You can call me insane, a whole 'nother planet on y'all
As-salaam alaikum, keep them Muslims on call
You could never fool us, and never do us so dumb
that we believe in you, you know where we come from, come from 

[Chorus]

[Bizzy Bone]
I can't even belch, now give me milk and not Welch
You don't understand my words, cause you need help
Hey Ms. computer hacker, here go a song for you
So my friends on the internet know that I'm still true
Bitch I am so cool, why would you test me as such?
And if I was yo' friend, I'd make you love me so much
But since I don't want nothin to do with you, you turn to a plot
And if you're makin money, it's funny you're tryin to stop what I got
Punk bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch (yeah)
Punk bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch (yeah)</pre>
