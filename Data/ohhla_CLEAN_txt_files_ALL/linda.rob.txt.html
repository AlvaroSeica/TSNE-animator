[Verse 1]
Every time I see you
I just wanna meet you
Say hello how you doing?
What are you doing tonight?
We should hook up tongiht
Have some fun tonight
Is that alright
I love your smile
You smile so bright
I'll compliment you all night
Thats no problem
If you got flaws I cant spot 'em
You ain't got 'em
From top to bottom baby you got it
And I want it
Classy ???
One of the finest girls I've ever seen
You and me would be a good thing
You can depend on me
Ven aqui take a chance on me
I guaratee I'll do whatever it takes
To make you feel happy
Just treat me right
And I'll be Right
The only Thing you'll need tonight
And every night I'll tuck you in
To make sure youre sleeping tight
Blow out the candle lights
and kiss you goodnight

[Chorus]
Linda Mujer tu sabes
Bien que te quiero baby
You drive me crazy
Such a classy lady
Such a lovely lady
I think I love you Baby

Linda Mujer
Tu sabes bien
Que Te quiero
Y por tu Amor
Yo si que muero

[Verse 2]
I saw you kicking back down the block
You stole my breathe I couldn't talk couldn't walk
Couldn't breathe please don't leave
You might be the one I need
Hopefully we'll talk eventually
Do you mention me?
When you talk to your friends
Oh how I hope you do
I wanna get close to you
Do notice me? I notice you
I love everything you do
I dont even know you
But I want to
Do you want me? cause I want you
And I'll do what I got to
Everytime I dream it's about you
There's something about you
There's something else
Couldn't see myself with noone else
Just the little things you do that really gots me digging you

[Chorus]
Linda mujer tu sabes
Bien que te quiero baby
You drive me crazy
Such a classy lady
Such a lovely lady
I think I love you Baby

Linda Mujer
Tu sabes bien
Que Te quiero
Y por tu Amor
Yo si que muero

[Verse 3]
You're so sophisticated
And I hate it
Gots me intimidated
I've got things to say
And I can't say 'em
Rather make this slow jam and play it
Dedicate it to you by the man who made it
Let me be your favorite thing
Head of your delivil things
You can tell me how you feel
Baby I'm for real believe me
I know what you mean
My love is king
Let me crown you with my heart
I think were wasting time and I think we should start
Well it's getting dark
Better let you go where do you live
And can I get you home
Do you have a phone I can reach you at?
A favorite place where I can meet you at?
Get together and have a drink or two
And let you know just how much I think of you

[Chorus]
Linda mujer tu sabes
Bien que te quiero baby
You drive me crazy
Such a classy lady
Such a lovely lady
I know I love you Baby

Linda Mujer
Tu sabes bien
Que Te quiero
Y por tu Amor
Yo si que muero</pre>
