Chorus: Noelle (T-Weaponz in background)
Quien (Quien, quien, quien)

Quien quiere que con migo (Quien quiere que, que)
Con migo (Con migo)

[Verse 1: Psalmz]
Some picked
We were good for one hit
Now that's some [{*shit*}]
One trip, and that's it
We done with
Dijeron I would hit a wall en mi camino
They said, "It couldn't be done," look
Y lo icimos
I did it my way, mi manera
Young
Quick to raise guns like bandera, from
A slum that was from a novela
Some
How, I had to get up escaleda, so
You can get to know mi nombre
It won't be
Long, til you know el hombre, so donde
Estan las bellacas, carambas
Shake it like maracas
Cuidado que no tumba la casa

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 2: IzReal]
Mami, ven
Aqui, dame un canto, I'm a keep it real
Not a santo, baby take it easy, no pas tanto
I'm just giving you a sample of everything
Your man can't show by example
Don't take this as a falto (No)
Of respect, but, what did you
Expect, mami, ponme la ahi, yo te falto
Hold up, this is an asalto
Legs in the air, ma, I'm coming for that banco
Heavyweight, que paso
Gotta carry (???) por sea caso
Somebody wanna act que un payaso, chacho
All you gonna hear is un balaso, listen
This is grown man business, you ain't dealin' with muchacos

[Noelle (T-Weaponz)]
Quien (Quien, quien, quien)
Quien quiere que (Quien quiere que, que, que)
Quien quiere que con migo (Who want what, what, what)
Quien quiere que con migo (Quien quiere que, que)
Con migo (Con migo)

[T-Weaponz]
Venimos, tomando
Nos damo, guayando
Estamos, fumando
Gosando, guayando

[Verse 3: Ark]
They told us we couldn't
Do it again, well, we did it
Now women callin'
To, all they friends, and they with it
Keep thinking that
My crew is a trend or a gimmick
When we finish
Be a few, of the best that ever did it, won't admit it
But these dudes are impressed by the lyrics, when we spit it
Mamis loosin' they breath, like we hit it, like we in it
Got loose in their dress, for a minute
We wicked
In the booth, and I bet it's T-Weaponz
We sippin' on a
Booze, in the V.I.P. section, so listen, mami
Move, I'm a show you, keep drinking
She wishin' that I
Knew or could tell what she thinkin', so I whispered that
I do, at the bar, around two, we can kick it

Repeat Chorus</pre>
