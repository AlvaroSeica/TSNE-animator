Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I do take it so I'm the shit
Just like a presidential I roll around
The time is ours, it's really ours
Take off the H, it's really ours
Get money

You know the crib on the water now
The Maybach stay watered down
Project niggas giving orders now
The gold presidential just to sport around
I'm from the era of fitted caps and rental cars
Dope pushers with ambition and pretty broads
Walking on Jewish marble, hand painted the ceiling
Happy Hanukkah nigga, it's a wonderful feeling
Got my seats on the wood, playas giving me gap
Lyor like how I move, want her right in my lap
I made a few mils, ain't mentioning Meek
Went and bought a new crib the weekend Wale released
Bitches, they keep coming
Bilie Jean thumping
I need to hear the trumpets, meaning machine gunning
I ain't missing nothing, got her sipping something
I could ship her something, you know that December coming

I do take it so I'm the shit
Just like a presidential I roll around
The time is ours, it's really ours
Take off the H, it's really ours

Put your Rollie in the sky and wave em high
Put your Rollie in the sky and wave em high
Put your Rollie in the sky and wave em high

I'm a young fly nigga, slap it for my era
I be touching hella bread like I'm working that pinera
Got a bad bitch with, good green with me
Travelling round the world but I'm coming from the city
Where Kanye did it, Lupe did it
Now Rockie Fresh is the next to get it
Fresh pair of Jordans in my right side, spit it
New gold Rollie, that was Rick Ross gifted
Playin in my mind, they dreamin about a time
when I get to try with Pharell like that will be dope as hell
I styled man verses, I'm making these rappers nervous
I love God but I can never work out the churches
I'm just blind, shake these purses
Running with the best set
Sweaty letter ground swimming in the wet wet
I keep er flying, in my bed is where she just sat
Smoking with my bitch, it's where I'm thinking about my next check

I do take it so I'm the shit
Just like a presidential I roll around
The time is ours, it's really ours
Take off the H, it's really ours

Put your Rollie in the sky and wave em high
Put your Rollie in the sky and wave em high
Put your Rollie in the sky and wave em high

They see me leaning in some new shit
Now it's gold presidentials for the cruise ship
Threesomes, weed crumbs on the cruise ship
I'm a boss have you ass on a news clip
She a dime but she gotta be a cool bitch
Pony tail, red nails, still in school bitch
Needed some cash so she asked me could she move shit
Not a chance, whips got her talking foolish
I was skipping them classes, but I got me a master
I was gifted at math, always counted the fastest
Fishscale made me major profit margins
I'm a profit stuffing my pockets, you niggas starving
Lord forgive me for my sins, I'm with this pretty bitch
80 grand, rubber band for some silly shit
She on that Alexandra Wang
Gold presidential Venus when I change the game

I do take it so I'm the shit
Just like a presidential I roll around
The time is ours, it's really ours
Take off the H, it's really ours

Put your Rollie in the sky and wave em high
Put your Rollie in the sky and wave em high
Put your Rollie in the sky and wave em high

She wanna roll with a winner now
So I let her roll with the windows down
My nigga's up the road come and get it now
60-40 know we split it up the middle now
Shawty's said the word, I was talking that talk
Maybe link up in New York, that's awesome as fuck
I never been in love until I heard a beat
She never met a G until she heard of me
3rd floor projects, feel my point of view
Everything is number 2, that's when it come to you
Isabel Mirant sneakers 'til the summer through
Fuck you on a yacht is what I wanna do
Baby girl got that wet wet
I repeat: wet wet
I'm the boss and I'm on that
White T, gold Rolex

I do take it so I'm the shit
Just like a presidential I roll around
The time is ours, it's really ours
Take off the H, it's really ours

I do take it so I'm the shit
Just like a presidential I roll around
The time is ours, it's really ours
Take off the H, it's really ours

Put your Rollie in the sky and wave em high
Put your Rollie in the sky and wave em high
Put your Rollie in the sky and wave em high

Her shoe game remarkable
I feel solely responsible
I feel solely responsible</pre>
