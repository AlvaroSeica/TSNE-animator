[Iron Sheik on Howard Stern]
LISTEN, VHAT THE FUCK?
NO GOOD SUNNUVABICH~!!

[Born Sun]
Bastard style with no father tryin to claim the kid
I called it X cause I ain't even tryin to name the shit
Sun Dllah, see me on the stage with Rip
Nitrogen lungs, yo my tongue mix propane with spit
And I'm nice as the voice of Christ resurrected through mics
Son of God, Son of Man, helping some of y'all will overstand
Crash the Vatican as soon as I land
I'm 'bout to set it on man in the Gulf of Adan
I stand, in the Garden of Eden, unbeaten undefeated
I tweeted pictures of Eve tonguin Jesus
Scientology guides put my rhymes on photography slides
to quantify the higher knowledge applied
But I'm an uncaged animal, channelin Hannibal
A cannibal, bite your head off and hand it to you
SpitBoss, centrifugal force different from yours
Sun is Born, this is "Lyrical Law" yo

[Iron Sheik on Howard Stern]
Fuck you! Who are you?
Either {?}, or Kennedy McMahon
(Fuck that guy! Fuck him!) EXACTLY~!
(Put him up on the satellite right now)
(Let's hear what he has to say for himself)

[K-Rino]
I've never been a friendly author
Don't need a gangster beat to make me off ya
I'll slaughter ya while playin Cyndi Lauper
Better than y'all, give me one competitive brawl
I throw a hundred miles an hour with a medicine ball
I'll melt your fortress down to caramel softness
Drive a charger through ya torso, parallel parkin
That cosmic ray beam effect, I Hiroshima wreck
Rap disaster so tragic they gave his ass a FEMA check
Cadence is radiant, I pre-dated Arcadians
I stayed with the brigade of alien ecto sapiens
Hit your through the atrium of heavenly light
Once I smite you like a left arm, you'll never be right
I've used every word possible to let you know what I can do
So I made something new, I'll collipherously clobber you
You ain't legitimate, you posin like a model
Dude I'll throttle you, liquidate and sixteen ounce bottle you

[Iron Sheik on Howard Stern]
IF YOU ARE THE MAN, COME AND SHOW ME
Because I'm ready, you cheap sunnuvabich
I just said it! I'm ready, any time you are!
I'll wrestle in, anything you want
What's the {?}cock up{?}, I'll beat you
Now, you wanna come challenge with the Iron Sheik?

[Canibus]
I'm tryin to figure out, who this nigga barkin at
Before his heart gets snatched, run up on him in a stocking cap
Keep barkin like you hard, get stalked and clapped
Come in the cage you get stomped on the mat
Carve your name in the axe, then chop you in the back
Hack off your femur bones, beat you with them like bats
Put your remains in saran wrap, dump them in a alcohol vat
You can rap, but you ain't all that
Step inside, close the door, fuck you yawnin for?
Kick your head off, now it's rollin on the floor like a bowling ball
Open the door, clean this fuckin mess off my wall
And don't ever mention his name no more
You dig, you follow me nigga, I follow you quicker
You got a weak ticker, told you not to fuck with the Ripper
Have you showin your true colors, drinkin blood from your liver
You a dickrider, and you an Indian giver
Wagin war with some guerillas, I'll bludgeon you by the river
The park ranger is pissin, he gon' find you while they fishin
Fist to the face, herpes simplex outbreak
Alienated aliens get ate by alien apes
You food nigga~! Throw yourself over the gate
How does alien taste? Like mammalian waste
You ain't swift, youse a dumb fuck; I'll have you breathin
like your lungs got struck by two-hundred pound nunchucks
Straight motherfuckers get slayed for hip-hop if you love it
like Kill Bill between a hundred gay lovers
I'm the illest nigga say somethin; yeah I thought so
Shut the fuck up things'll go back to normal
I ain't happy though, now I'm in battle mode
The President of hip-hop, with mad motherfuckers on the grassy knoll
I take it back to my curriculum days
What you say? I body you in meticulous ways
Cause you thought I was a donut, you tried to glaze
Let me tell you somethin, don't pop shit, fistula face
Battle league nigga, talking shit's for amateurs nigga
God dammit~! Y'all livin off fantasies nigga
You wanna battle that bad, aight go get your camera
When it's my turn, I got a four and a half pound answer
When I was young, I took down hard targets
You a sausage nigga, for coming at me like a novice
You never heard "Fraternity of the Impoverished?"
Motherfucker, can't you see that I'm an artist?
I don't want them childish problems
Lyrical manslaughter charges interfere with my "Lyrical Law" process
Out rap me, that's preposterous
Metaphor marksman mudswampin, we hunt down hip-hop monsters
Skin 'em alive tie their carcass to the bottom of my Polaris
then drive them all the way to Wisconsin, partner
Fuck around, throw yo' ass under the bus face down
Lay down, we gonna wait for this Greyhound
The fuck you gon' say now?
Do me a favour, stop weighin me down
Fuckin clown, "Lyrical Law" is too muscle bound
Houdini style nigga, just struggle and drown
Get it over with, you can never fuck with my style
You got raped nigga, you bleedin, don't touch my towel
You can spit them whack juice punchline lines all you want
But don't front, bottom line, I'm a champ, you a chump
You can spit your stupid punchlines all you want
But after this the whole world gon' see who won
That's what you wanted right, get the fuck off my mic
