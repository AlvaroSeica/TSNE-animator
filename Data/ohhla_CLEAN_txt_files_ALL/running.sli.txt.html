Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Hey man you feel it
The blood is rushin' through my veins
And I wanna see you
Coming again
Believe it
You feel it
You know you wanna see it too
So when the fuck are you gonna realize
Hey man its time to say
I'm coming to get you
And I wanna see you
Running away from me
I'm coming to get you
I'm coming to you
And I wanna see you
Running away from me
Running away
Hey man you see it
A needle's jammed inside my veins
And every little thing is gonna be the fucking same
Believe it
You feel it
You know you wanna see it too
So when the fuck are you gonna realize
Hey man it's time to say
I'm coming to get you
And I wanna see you
Running away from me
I'm coming to get you
I'm coming to you
And I wanna see you
Running away from me
Hey man you feel it
The blood is rushin' through my veins
And I wanna see you
Coming again
Believe it
You feel it
You know you wanna see it too
So when the fuck are you gonna realize
Hey man it's time to say
I'm coming to get you
And I wanna see you
Running away from me
I'm coming to get you
I'm coming to you
And I wanna see you
Running away from me
Running away
