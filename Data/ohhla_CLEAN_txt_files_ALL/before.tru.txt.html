Typed by: Ibabyboyboo@aol.com 

You know, the worst part about living
is knowin' one day that you gon' have to die
In the meantime, you have to come to terms with yourself, before you die

[Jhaz]
Before I die, laid and put to rest
Before I climb the wall, before I take my last breath
May I come to know the real of it all
Face-to-face with death, discover why the toughest fall
Dog, at home alone at night
My dreams be scary, got a sista fiendin' to the daylight
And if by circumstance, somehow I end up stiff
I promise that I ain't the only one that's gon' end up in a ditch
To all of this, I wish I find a reason why we end up dead
So I be prayin', dog, before I die

[Brina]
Before I flatline, carried away in a casket
I ask this question, Lord: will You be openin' the gates to the green pastures
Or will a sista fall prey to the gates of Hell?
So Brina pass times through these ghetto blues
Had to do what I had to do, really
Survival is the key, everyday tryin' dodge them toe-tags
Gotta good heart, tryin' hard to raise mine
You made room for a sista's jumpstart
Playa haters, they hate me
Will the devil put one of those fools to work
Or will I die of natural cause?
Either way it goes, I feel the hurt, so I ask of You
Lord: keep my family strong on top of this weak game that'll catch 'em, too
I'm on streets of Hell anyday
Amen</pre>
