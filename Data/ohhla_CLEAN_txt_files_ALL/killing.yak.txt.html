(2Pac Talking)

Hey who ya'll wanna fuck?
K say he wanna fuck da brat
Yak said he wanna fuck somebody in the ?
That nigga malc said he wanna fuck a leo, fuck it
Mutah said he wanna fuck Toni Braxton like a muthafucker hahahaha
Thats right nigga, get paid

Who's that?
Big Malcolm
Living like a G
Hollywood
up top with a 5th of Hennessey
Mutah
said you love beating bitches live
K-Dog
On the real gettin high
Label us the young thugs
Niggas leave with much mail
Fuck hoes, fuck the law, and fuck jail
Young niggas never had a prayer to prevail
These killing fields can be hell

(EDI [Big Malcolm])

You see its uh complicated
We grew up crime related
From watchin them old folks smoke dope
Yo it left us faded
But on the kiling fields
As real as some niggas chill
Realize and recognizin
You survive if you got bigger steel
Then it was only a minute till our time was coming
Yo it was at the point
Don't have no run ins with those fucking youngins
See all the grown ups was dead or smoked up
Left with no game to soak up
We said fuck it and loc'd up
Back to the street to escape it
And to make beats
But then there would be those who'd be rich if we didnt did it
Murder but aint nobody feel us
Still now its too late
We aint nothing but bait for them killin fields

[Chorus]
Gotta keep my eyes on the steal
Cant be the victim but killing fields
But if I must, then I guess I just will
So ima bust, and kick dust when it is

Gotta keep my eyes on the steal
Cant be the victim but killing fields
But if I must, then I guess I just will
So ima bust, and kick dust when it is

(Kastro [K-Dogg])

I came through lookin up to who
The high rollers with the gold chains
But now as I look back and think about my wishes
Seeing them same killin niggas turn to snitches
So I stay high and suspicious
Oh these fields can get real fuckin vicious
I know you feel me
If you nigga how you can't
I'm gettin hot and lick a shot when im amped
And I aint got nothing on my mind but my riches
Bury me a G aint got time for no bitches (biatch)
Thinkin they fuckin with a nigga on heels
Baby I must keep it real
For my niggas on these killin fields


[Chorus]

(Yaki Kadafi [Young Hollywood])
Now I can get through this
Aint nothing to this
Matter of fact many if not plenty more
Muthafuckas be alive
If they knew this
I keeps my shit wicked
Throw your hands in the muthafuckin air as I kick it
Tryin to see a meal ticket before im gone
Papa never got the chance to tell me it was on
So now I?m torn
Trapped between the devils curse and a hearse
Left with nothing but childhood pictures in my grandmamas purse
Now I strap up for the showdown
Grab my four pound and some more rounds
Bet these thugs would love to slug
So get low down
Words can't express how I feel for my steel
On these muthafuckin killin fields

[Chorus]</pre>
