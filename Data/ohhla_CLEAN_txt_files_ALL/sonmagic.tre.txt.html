[Trey Songz]
So what if you flipped a couple birds, I could triple that in words
Open my head you see, and the feds
That means it's heavy on my mind, think about it all the time
Then I write another rhyme, get richer before they get a
Na nigga I consider a friend of mine
Considerin I drink a lot of liquor my livers fine
Figurin there ain't a lot a niggaz could really rhyme
So when I'm spittin I be chillin and killin time
But on that other shit thuggin it, fellas can't fuck with it
I'm on another level, R&amp;B rebel
Killin these fools, so tell me where is the shovel?
Feelin these dudes? Then you're ears must stuggle
What I'm really meanin is my peers in trouble
They can work hard but I'm putting in double
I ain't tryin to dis, really I am though
Cause if I'm in timbos, them niggaz is?
But you can still catch me at a beach
Gettin a little piece of a freak
Gettin a little brain from a dame
Facts still remain the same
It's Treymane one of the best in the game

[Chorus]
And I'm getting it I'm getting it
I ain't talking about it, I'm living it
I'm getting it, straight getting it
Get get get get get get get it boy
(Don't waste your time, fighting the law)
(State your voice, and you'll understand)

[Trey Songz]
Now sick state of mind that I be in
In my prime for that time I'm Jay-Z'in
If it wasn't for the burg where I come up
Then never would these ever so clever words ever come up
Uh, no pain no profit
They say the game got a key well I'm the locksmith
They say you 'Mayne got they keys, but he hot shit
You can shop with him but you might get knocked quick
Fresh J's, 360 ways
Lookin at the dope boys, while they chop on blades
Pocket full of hope like I gotta get paid
Nickel bags too fat they gotta get Trey
Heavy in the game but I never get played
Call me Kanye when my chedda gets?
They can try to get me; I will never stand down
ou can call me 50 when I take a man down

[Chorus]</pre>
