[Intro]
Hit makers, crack music
Yeah! Frederico!

[Verse 1]
You don't know who I am, but you're selling it
Godson, you won't see the gun, I'm concealing it
You heard the son murder one on em beats, I'm killing it
Free style, they pay the NBA though I'm billing it!
Carry the one, you own me like a rack five
I'm listening to Michigan, new niggas fast five
Awesome is generous, me I'm old Chris Weather!
Still on the streets, summer time is even great weather (that's right)
I'm about to buy a firm, bottle of Ginobily
Dunkin from the dot, I'm hopping out that flyin spur
Ginobily, notice I said Duncan
I listen to em rap, I noticed they say nothing
I'm from a different breed, your flow too regular
I'm 500 to O, oh this is different weed
A cancer patient last days, I'm too sick to see
Nigga get with me, it's Frederico!

[Chorus: x2]
I call my thugs Eli they in the shotgun
I call my thugs T-bone they in the shotgun
I call my thugs Sanchez they in the shotgun
BX, we've got one, it's Fred The Godson!

[Verse 2]
Diabetic, I've been winning
These bricks is sweet, but so I stash em in ceilings
Good so the half could be half a key, get it sealed in
Snitches treat the cops like cavities get em filled in!
I'm in front of the building, building with OGs
Grandson been waiting on his appeal since '03
OT, you know me! My stamp look the same way
Push X&amp;Os, like play-station game play (get it?)
The Ranger gray, the Bentley black
You can see right through it, we might just hit the back
Tramp house in Maine, man I just print the back
My sister need me, Western Union, so I send the stack!
That life, I'm about it!
I'm here getting right, you just right about it
You niggas never been shit
This TBM shit, it's TBM shit!

[Chorus: x2]
I call my thugs Eli they in the shotgun
I call my thugs T-bone they in the shotgun
I call my thugs Sanchez they in the shotgun
BX, we've got one, it's Fred The Godson!</pre>
