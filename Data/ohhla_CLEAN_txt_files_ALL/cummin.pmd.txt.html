Verse 1:
Grab ya head nigga, start bobbin it, the underground's
bein shook down PMDs robbin it, so crack all gold yeah,
and spark the phillie blunts, im chumpin niggaz down 
takin minds on a manhunt (po-po kid), dont get caught 
up in the gunsmoke, its rap artin season, and im blastin
niggaz who show-off, with that pretty-boy R&amp;B rap, back 
with a hiphop track, say that, cause thats whack, and 
niggaz aint trying to hear that, cant get sidetracked
so whats the impact, to get the bozack, and mind yo 
beeswax, still in the game with somethin Jane.

Chorus--
Went solo on that ass when i feel the fame
(I saw it cummin, thats why i went solo)

Verse 2:
Whats this? another funky hit from the squad kid? no time
for comebacks black, time to run shit, so pass that 
microphone, plug it into the soundboard,scratch cuts the 
wax, chop it like a chainsaw, so who's callin my name?
been doin this since 87' cause this is my thing, can't
forget Jane, haircut, like Anita Baker, never seen no
one faker, to make the mistake-a, tryin to push up
on a brother, who brainstorms, you know i'm physco crazy
like that man nor--man bates, wait, excuse me for the
(???) that makes me hesitate, no time to translate,gotta
go kid, time to motivate, back to the blackzone, cuz
theres no thing.

Chorus
X5

Verse 3:
There's somethin with all these corny niggaz, makin 
faces, on my TV screen, cant shoot this dude, cause if
I do it makes 19, no time for the crime scene, grab my
Bozack, and my mic, time to beam, back to the underground
hold more beat-downs, drop some ill shit like this, for
the niggaz to leave round town HARDCORE, hittin switches
in the '6-4, 3 foot motion, or the benz with the 4-door
troopin past the local spot, niggaz wanna act up, and
niggaz catch the speedknot, trying to promote viloence,
but thats the way it is, the code of the ghetto aint got
nothin to do with showbiz, remember that, yea, still
bustin brains, YEA

chorus
X4
