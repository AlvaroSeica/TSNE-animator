[Intro]
(Aw shit!) Another day another dollar my homey
(It's that Hustle Hard right here man!)
You already smell, you know how it go
(It's cold outside) Same old shit, just a different day
But feel the +Aftermath+, even +Dre+

[Chorus: Lil' Kim]
The same old shit, just a different toilet
It is what it is, sometimes I cain't call it
I need another house - another coop
I'm tryin to buy a alley, so guess what I'ma do?
Hustle, hustle, hustle hustle hard {*3X*}
Closed mouths don't get fed on this boulevard

[Lil' Kim]
Million dollar deposit
Half a mill' in my closet
Phantom milky white chocolate
If the roof is on then I chop it
S1 on my finger
But it's still real in that Beemer
I just bought the new M6
while they customizin my Gina
Can we pull up at your party
Maybachs, Ferraris
Ducatis 'n Hollys
Pink seats in Bugatis
Don't nothin move 'til I say so
We all about them pesos
IRS, nigga we the mob
We hustle hard, cocaine dough
Gatless 'stead of topless
Ain't them bitches solid?
My mens bought me that white rose
and I ain't talkin flowers
Occupied you workers
What'chu worry about what I'm earnin?
Money I keep burnin
As the world keep turnin

[Chorus]</pre>
