[VERSE 1: Qu'ran]
There was a time, I used to wish I was older
So I can look over my own shoulder
When it came time for partyin
I always had to check with a guardian
You know, mom and dad
Sometimes I think about the fun I could've had
Swingin with my crew
I used to boo-hoo about my early curfew
If I didn't show up, I'd be on punishment
Guess where the rest of my week will be spent
Yeah, in the house, lookin like a jerk
My boys are havin fun while I'm doin housework
I remember one time in the game
I could hear my mom callin my name
I had two strikes, workin on the third
Somebody yelled out, "Yo, Qu'ran's a early bird!"
But I ain't pay it no mind
Cause back then a hard head made a soft behind
My mother always said, "Don't worry 'bout a cup
It's all a part of growin up"
But nevertheless
Like they say - mom knows best

[Chorus]
This is a little somethin for the youngsta's
(Listen up youngster)
A little somethin for the youngsta's

[VERSE 2: Taji]
If we wasn't in the store playin video games
We was chillin on the block, callin each other names
Nah, nothin too offensive
But you had to wear gear that was expensive
Like 100 dollar sneaks
Even though they'd be dogged in two weeks
I didn't care, all my boys had a pair
Except for me, I didn't think it was fair
I told my moms the price, she frowned ( ? )
Said, "Son, they cost more than a phone bill
Be thankful for what you got on your feet
Some people don't have nothin out on the street
Learn to be yourself, learn to be original
And don't worry about the next individual"
I feel as though this needs to be expressed
Nevertheless, mom knows best

[Chorus]

[VERSE 3: Tarik]
24 hours, 7 days a week
We played Ding Dong Dixie and hide-n-go-seek
We chased down girls, actin like a fool
It was even days that we hookied from school
But never again
Once mom started yellin it was no tellin when
She was gonna whip out a belt
I could've put ice on her, it probably would've melt
I know momma's call, once I heard her shout
"I ( ? ) and you can bet I take you out
All I hear is "Clear your room and wash the dishes"
Sometimes I wanna click my heels and make three wishes
1 to be older, 2 to be a rap star
3 to be drivin in a nice, fat car
As long as I live at this address
Nevertheless, mom knows best

[Chorus] </pre>
