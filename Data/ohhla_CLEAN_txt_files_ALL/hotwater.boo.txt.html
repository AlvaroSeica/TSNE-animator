[ Vex ]
Hot water in the wilderness
Hot water in the wilderness
Let me say it again
Hot water in the wilderness
Hot water in the wilderness
I'ma tell you again
[ Vex &amp; Mondo ]
Hot water in the wilderness
Hot water in the wilderness
[ Vex ]
Let me say it again
[ Vex &amp; Mondo ]
Hot water in the wilderness
Hot water in the wilderness
[ Vex ]
Yes?

[ Tysha ]
When the slaves left Egypt, they never would have guessed
That they would be blessed in the wilderness
And now away from the ghettos our people must flee
Crack, crime and poverty are the shackles I see
How long will we live in this state of emergency?
In a place where hot water's the only thing that's free
Take me to the hot spring that lives by the meadow
Give me something else besides death in the ghetto
See, when the slaves left Egypt, they never would have guessed
That they'd find mannah and hot water in the wilderness
Nowadays our children have no place to play
Cause everyday someone is killed by a stray
And still we live on without anything to say
As the closing of time shows us we can't stay
The population of our growing black nation
Hasn't changed since our ancestors were brought to plantations
So - recognize these thresholds of negative stress
You can get YOUR hot water in the wilderness ( *echo* )

[ *gradually fading out* ]
[ Vex ]
Hot water in the wilderness
Hot water in the wilderness
Let me say it again
Hot water in the wilderness
Hot water in the wilderness
I'ma tell you again
[ Vex &amp; Mondo ]
Hot water in the wilderness
Hot water in the wilderness
[ Vex ]
Let me say it again
[ Vex &amp; Mondo ]
Hot water in the wilderness
Hot water in the wilderness
[ Vex ]
Yes?</pre>
