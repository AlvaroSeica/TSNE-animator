(Sample from a country song)
So he starts to roam the streets at night
And he learns how to steal
And he learns how to fight...
In the ghetto
In the ghetto
In the ghetto
In the ghetto
In the ghetto

(Verse 1, DJ Paul)
Survival is a everyday task
Watchin ya back for the man wearin a mask (In the ghetto)
I say ya might get stuck
If you in the hood lookin like ya came up (In the ghetto)
We ride old school whips
High off the ground, right beside a playa hip (In the ghetto)
It ain't as bad as it seems
We still "Stay Fly" lookin so so clean (In the ghetto)

(Verse 2, Juicy J)
First I'm broke
So I hang out with a rat and roach
And still broke
Cause I'm sleepin on apartment floors (In the ghetto)
The junkies get a, ki-ki-kick
When he smoke a brick
I never seen a drug dealer ever call it quits (In the ghetto)
The hood struggle is to make it
Gotta get the change
See everyday is like a dark cloud full of rain (In the ghetto)
The Feds tappin
Fool it's dangerous when you hood-trappin
So don't get lost in the sauce, slangin cold cracklin (In the ghetto)

In the ghetto
In the ghetto
In the ghetto
In the ghetto
In the ghetto

(Speech)
So help your brother along the way
No matter where he starts (In the ghetto)
The same God that made you
Made him too (In the ghetto)</pre>
