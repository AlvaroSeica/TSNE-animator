(Hook, Project Pat)
We chiefin like a injun (Hey-ya-ya-yaaa)
Smokin like a injun (Hey-ya-ya-yaaa)
Chiefin like a injun (Hey-ya-ya-yaaa)
Smokin like a injun (Hey-ya-ya-yaaa)
We chiefin like a injun (Hey-ya-ya-yaaa)
Smokin like a injun (Hey-ya-ya-yaaa)
Chiefin like a injun (Hey-ya-ya-yaaa)
Smokin like a injun (Hey-ya-ya-yaaa)

(Verse 1, Project Pat)
I'm so high I'm facin fears; That's high as fuck
This weed so good gotta close yo ears; That's loud as fuck
Rollin up that West Coast, papers, cigars
Bongs, weed pipes, really smoke it all
You know I fuck with them vapors
Smoke real under the table
Smoke a pound back to back, this drank got me faded
I can't see a damn thang out these Gucci aviators
Got my lean on ice, lookin for some kush later
Break that shit on down, roll up another blunt
Bitch I burn up til I turn up, then I do my own stunts
Got my white girl bringing me a new strand
Lean in my cup lets go H.A.M.
Moving slower than a old man

(Hook, Project Pat)
We chiefin like a injun (Hey-ya-ya-yaaa)
Smokin like a injun (Hey-ya-ya-yaaa)
Chiefin like a injun (Hey-ya-ya-yaaa)
Smokin like a injun (Hey-ya-ya-yaaa)
We chiefin like a injun (Hey-ya-ya-yaaa)
Smokin like a injun (Hey-ya-ya-yaaa)
Chiefin like a injun (Hey-ya-ya-yaaa)
Smokin like a injun (Hey-ya-ya-yaaa)

(verse 2, Wiz Khalifa)
Young Khalifa man and I'm a playa-ya-ya
Rollin up that reefer everyday-ya-ya-ya
Try me you gon see that I don't play-ya-ya-ya
No shirt on, he loadin up that K-ya-ya-ya
Talkin shit, where find out where he stay-ya-ya-ya
Hit him up with something make him say-ya-ya-ya
Chopper bullets hit him in is face-ay-ya-ya
Taliban; the way my niggas spray- pow-pow-pow
Run up on you, what'chu niggas sayin nigga? Right now
Heard you got that Kush, but it ain't right, it's that light brown
You niggas in the way-ya-ya-ya
Roll with me, my bitch do what I say-ya-ya-ya

(Hook, Project Pat)
We chiefin like a injun (Hey-ya-ya-yaaa)

Chiefin like a injun (Hey-ya-ya-yaaa)

(Verse 3, Project Pat)
Hey-ya-ya-ya
Smokin on that fiya-ya-ya
Turnt up on that white liquor; Vodka
Smokin on this green like a Rasta
I got the wax candles lit; Like a crucifix
It's a true blessing to be inhaling some Cali shit
Red hairs mixed with purple hairs; That Kool-Aid Kush
A fo' poured up, mixed with some orange crush
We on some extra notch shit, bout to lift off
My partner put in on this, he at work, he pissed off
Them bitches on they way dog, my dick like crow bar
I hope they got they shoes on, I'ma knock they socks off

(Hook, Project Pat)
We chiefin like a injun (Hey-ya-ya-yaaa)
Smokin like a injun (Hey-ya-ya-yaaa)
Chiefin like a injun (Hey-ya-ya-yaaa)
Smokin like a injun (Hey-ya-ya-yaaa)
We chiefin like a injun (Hey-ya-ya-yaaa)
Smokin like a injun (Hey-ya-ya-yaaa)
Chiefin like a injun (Hey-ya-ya-yaaa)
Smokin like a injun (Hey-ya-ya-yaaa)</pre>
