[Chorus - T.I.] - w/ ad libs
Hey shorty, tip that ass up for me, while you back up to me
Make it stand up for me, let's go, yeah
Shorty lift that ass up, drop it, got it standin rock solid
Want this money in my pocket? Here you go
I make 'em put that ass up for me, while they back up to me
Make it stand up for me, let's go, yeah
Shorty why don't you lift that ass up, drop it, got it standin rock solid
Want this money in my pocket? Here you go
Everything on me, if I can put it on you
Everything on me, if I can put it on you
Everything on me, if I can put it on you
Everything on me, let me put it on you, on you

[Verse 1 - T.I.]
I'm in the club late night, get my freak on
RÃ©my XO, leave that Hennessy alone
And two or three shown, turnin me on
Ain't got nothin but some high heels and they weave on
If you ain't freakin over here, you don't belong
Do it if it feel good, no matter if it seem wrong
She say I got a ding dong like King Kong
We can go and kick it, wait a minute, that's my theme some
Hold on, I want yo' body
Wanna pull it out and put it all on your body
You and me, we can leave, have a late night party
You do it for me like I like, I just might buy a Maserati

[Chorus] - w/ ad libs

[Verse 2 - T.I.]
You got your Dominican, Asian, Brazilian
Big booty white girls, who like girls, want me to hit again
Black and Puerto Rican, you freakin for the weekend
Say "yes, right now, we leavin", you say "no, well why we freakin?"
Now with all do respect, I don't front, I don't plex
Take your girlfriend with ya, I just wanna have sex
You so fine, I'm impressed, ghetto booty, perky breasts
Grindin on me in my lap, I'm about as hard as I can get
Now she smilin, lookin back, yeah I know you feel that
In that p-pus' so fast and wet, just let me put it to the test
Song's over, tried to play her, she say "I ain't finished yet"
I said "well you gon' need a towel, 'cause you fittin to make a mess"
Hey that my song, hold on, I want yo' body
Wanna pull it out and put it all on your body
You and me, we can leave, have a late night party
You do it for me like I like, I just might buy a Maserati

[Chorus] - w/ ad libs

[Verse 3 - T.I.]
Hey, if you freakin for the weekend, let me know
Hit me when the club close, bust it open, we can go
Here we go, if you down to get it poppin, get at me
If you wanna be with her, then you both can be with me, it's a G
If you 'bout, I'm a put it on you
You ain't gotta be a groupie to be part of the group
Is it true? If you 'bout it, I'm a put it on you
You ain't gotta be a groupie to be part of the group
