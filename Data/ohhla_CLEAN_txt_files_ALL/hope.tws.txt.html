Man I know we had a lot of tragedies lately
I just wanna say rest in peace to Aaliyah
Rest in peace to Left-Eye, rest in peace to Jam Master Jay
And everybody lost in the Twin Towers, and everybody lost period
All we got is hope..

[Verse 1: Twista]
I wish the way I was livin' could stop
Servin' rocks, knowin' the cops is hot when I'm on the block
And I - wish my brother would've made bail
So I won't have to travel six hours to see him in jail
And I - wish that my grandmother wasn't sick
Or that we would just come up on some stacks and hit a lick (I wish)
And I - wish my homies wouldn't have to suffer
When the streets get the upper hand understand we lose a brother
And I - wish I could go deep in the zone
And lift the spirits of the world with words within this song (I wish)
And I - wish I could teach us all to fly
Take away the pain out your hands and help you hold 'em high
And I - wish God had never gave the men power
To be able to hurt the people inside the Twin Towers (I wish)
And I - wish God would've turned they hearts righteous
When they started to take innocent lives and become snipers
But uh - we will never break though they devastate
We shall motivate, and we gotta pray, all we got is faith
Instead of thinkin' about who gon' die today
The Lord is gon' help you feel better so you ain't gotta cry today
Sit at the light so long
And then we gotta move straight forward cause we bite so strong
So when right go wrong
Just say a lil' prayer, get your money man, life goes on... (Let's go)

[Chorus: Cee-Lo]
Cause I'm hopeful, yes I am, hopeful for today
Take this music and use it, let it take you away
And be hopeful, hopeful, and He'll make a way
I know it ain't easy but - that's okay
Just be hopeful

[Verse 2: Twista]
I wish that you would show some love
Instead of hatin' so much when you see some other people comin' up (I wish)
I wish I could teach the world to sing
Write some music and have them trippin' off the joy I bring
Shit - I wish that we can hold hands
Listenin' instead of dissin', lessons from a grown man (I wish)
And I - wish the families that lack but got love
Get some stacks, brand new shack, and a 'Llac that's on dubs
And I - wish we could keep achieving wonders
See the vision of the world through the eyes of Stevie Wonder (I wish)
You feel me - and I hope all the kids eat
And don't nobody in my family see six feet - ya dig?
I hope the mothers stand strong
You can make it whether you with him or your man's gone (I wish)
And I - wish I could give every celly some commissary
And no popo bring the heat on our peace like they did R. Kelly
And I - wish that D.O.C. could scream again
And bullets could reverse and Pac and Biggie breathe again
Shit - and one day they can speak again
I wish that we only saw good news every time we look at CNN
I wish that enemies could talk
And that Super-homie Christopher Reeve could still walk (I wish)
I wish that we could walk the path stay doin' the right thing
Hustle hard so them kids maintain up in the game (Let's go)

[Chorus: Cee-Lo]
Cause I'm hopeful, yes I am, hopeful for today
Take this music and use it, let it take you away
And be hopeful, hopeful, and He'll make a way
I know it ain't easy but - that's okay
Just be hopeful

[Verse 3: Twista]
Wish the earth wasn't so apocaliptic
I try to spread my message to the world the best way that I can give it
We can make it, always so optimistic
If you don't listen, gotta live my life the best way that I can live it
I pray for justice when we go to court
Wish it was all good so the country wouldn't have to go to war
Why can't we kick it and just 'em on
And in the famous words of Mister King, 'why can't we all just get along?'
Hope we can find a better way to shop in peace
And I - hope we find a better way to cop for keys
And I - wish everybody would just stop and freeze
And ask - why are fulfilling these downfalls and these prophecies
You can be wrong if it's you doubtin'
With the faith of a mustard seed, you can move mountains
And only the heavenly father can ease the hurt
Just let it go and keep prayin' on your knees in church (Let's go)

[Chorus: Cee-Lo]
Cause I'm hopeful, yes I am, hopeful for today
Take this music and use it, let it take you away
And be hopeful, hopeful, and He'll make a way
I know it ain't easy but - that's okay
Just be hopeful
(Repeat)

Na na na na na na na na na
Just be hopeful
(Repeat)

Na na na na na na na na na
