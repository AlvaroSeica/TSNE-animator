[Kokane]
In these times, of hate and pain
We need a remedy, to help us through the rain 
Can't you see, I'm straight O-Gin

[Snoop Dogg] Old Chief

[Kokane]
Fuck you niggas, think you can't fuck with me

[Suga Free](Snoop Dogg)
Oh c'mon
Now that pimp is gonna jump back
Bitch, and fuck that 
Shit, I'm qualify to knock a hoe no matter where ever I've go
Excuse me partner, this is pimpin' little pimpin let you know 
Break the bitch you say "I will"
Separate the bitch but you saying "I will"
Damn nigga, shit; since you put it like that
I'm about to lay some right now nigga
And take them straight to the track (track)
I've never let a bitch pimp me
Trying to tell me what to do but I'mma stay O.G.
Fresh out the pen only 32 days (32 days)
And every bitch ? in a multiply ways
Now it's a sick world,
Why did the little girl walk around with a gold fish in her pocket 
So she could smell like the big girl
And check the one with the fast mouth
Just get your money if you have to knock her motherfucking ass out

[Kokane]
I don't care whatcha do 
Long you don't fuck with mine (C'mon sing ya'll)
You think you can't be touched
Niggas disappear all the time

[Snoop Dogg]
Old "Blue Eyes," Dogg Sinatra
Make a nigga disappear like Jimmy Hoffa (Where is he?)
The glock cocker, ho hopper, show stopper
Watch your mouth, watch your mouth
I'll put you in a brick in a building
And separate you from your children (Daddy)
I stay G'd up
All the G's from my set ain't never P-C-up (hahaha)
If you hit the main line 
You gonna get stop 
Paying motherfuckers off cause sucka duck
Me and my niggas go heart and pain
Puttin paint where it ain't, makin bitch niggas faint
It's a clear blue sky there on the Eastside (Eastside)
Throw your set up and wave it from (Rolling) side to c-side
I'm talking big shit, holdin my dick
Banging on you cuz, nigga this crip

[Kokane](Suga Free)
I got so many tricks up my sleeve (Oh y'all ain't knowin')
For you hoes to disbelieve (Hoes in amazement)
You wanna bang let's bring it on (Oh Oh)
We about thousand niggas strong 
I don't care whatcha you do (I don't care what the fuck whatcha do)
Long you don't fuck with me (As long you don't fuck with mine)
You think you can't be touched (Uhhhhh)
Niggas disappear all the time

[Suga Free]
No, I don't love you bitch, ou a hoe, I never will (Never will) 
Can't tell you my feelings cause the pimpin don't feel
Bitch, matter fact be gone
Fuck around and have your Momma saying "Baby, he wrong!"
Talking about he a real pimp
Bitch, is jumbo laced with the proper crop of jumbo shrimp
Since I'm prepare with my hoe, got it crackin with my hoe
Study mackin with my hoe, now I'm stackin with my hoe

[Snoop Dogg]
I pop a bottle of Mo
About to model a hoe
I'm working them, serving 'em and breaking a ? (You know)
Did the weed, man get in 
Take it too long 
But when he get it dogg
I'm taking us off (Give it up nigga)
Niggas know how D-O-double G "does it"
Known for making that crip hop music, don't abuse it
Just ride to the rhythm of a pimp ass, upper class, cold motherfucker

[Kokane]
(Humming)

[Kokane] 
Long you don't fuck with mine 
You think you can't be touched
Niggas disappear all the time
