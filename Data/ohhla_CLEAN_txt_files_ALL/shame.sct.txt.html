[Verse Three: Eve]
Uh! Aiyyo! I'm the magnificent with the sensational style
Yes! Check her head to toe don't forget the smile
Blessed! If you were smart you would try to snatch it up
Movin like a snail when you 'gon catch up?!
Be on it 'cause I'm bored laughin 'cause you just a clown now
Ain't worthy of the Queen papi bow down
Really bow out, how does that sound?
Had a chance in the past fall back now!
I mean way back, like disappear
I see through all of you and it's so clear
And I'm so good, how you so wack?
How you let this get away you 'gon regret that
Shorty so live, from the 2-1-5
And you was too late now I'm sayin bye bye

And it's a shaaaaaaammmmmmmeeee!!!! (SHAME! SHAME! SHAME!)
Your missin out, on me (WOOO!!!)
And it's a shaaaaaaammmmmmmeeee!!!! (SHAME! SHAME! SHAME!)
