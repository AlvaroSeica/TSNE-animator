[Intro]
Call em up call em up call em up
Call em up call em up call em up
Call em up call em up call em up
Call em up

[Chorus]
Welcome to my world of materialistic mafuckers
That's how its is when I'm hanging and banging
Welcome to my world
Where I B straight stripping mafuckers
Cuz they b suckers slanging goods in my hood

Call em up call em up call em up
Call em up call em up call em up
Call em up call em up
U better call somebody (eh yoooo)
Cuz iamma fuck around at night and catch me a body

[Verse 1]
Materialistic mean cherry bread mystic seat
You heard him floss, but he can't do shit wit me
You heard of the Outlawz
But mafuckker this is the G
And won't change for a mafuckker this is me
Down 2 the ground and charish peeps That past B4 me
I'm still here for the real homiez that's askin 4 me
No love, but for those that will blast 4 me
Don't ask mamma 4 shit, but please have a casket 4 me
Hustler without a record deal
You boy still kill them
Gun off safety
Gangster 31 like Roy Williams
In the hood cuz I wanna B
And when I feel like it's on
I give them the look
To put ur pussy niggas under me
It's a war goin on outside
No man is safe from
When u gotta pay back the same shit u take from

[Chorus]
Call em up call em up call em up
Call em up call em up call em up
Call em up

Welcome to my world of materialistic mafuckers
That's how its is when I'm hanging and banging
Welcome to my world
Where I B straight stripping mafuckers
Cuz they b suckers, slanging goods in my hood

Call em up call em up call em up
Call em up call em up call em up
Call em up call em up
U better call somebody (eh yoooo)
Cuz iamma fuck around at night and catch me a body

[Verse 2]
I floss like a boss supposed to
And it musta been something he did that make him
Ever cross the????
I'm hood without this rap shit
Homie I'm hood
I ain't bragging bout my thug life
Fuck it I'm good
The killers feel me
And they don't kill me, mang I hustle
1 man hit team, Ali Bang for muscle
What do we have hear now
Nope, not 2pac another thug nigga
Braze similar style
Hard life entertainment and life
To a white mans world
When u get played wit your life
Won't front I'm a rap nigga
But the dangerous type
And how I'm livin
I ain't sayin its right
But I'm the real hood
I bang and floss on these niggas cuz it feels good
And if the jealous ain't kill them
The pills would
These niggas know they know
What I'm know for
But they won't think it's real
Till I'm standing in their grill
Wit a chrome 4

[Chorus]
Welcome to my world of materialistic mafuckers
That's how its is when I'm hanging and banging
Welcome to my world
Where I B straight stripping mafuckers
Cuz they b suckers, slanging goods in my hood

Call em up call em up call em up
Call em up call em up call em up
Call em up call em up
U better call somebody (eh yoooo)
Cuz iamma fuck around at night and catch me a body</pre>
