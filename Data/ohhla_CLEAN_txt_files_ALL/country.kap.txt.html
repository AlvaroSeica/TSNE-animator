This for my Grandmother Tiger, and my Grandmother Blanch
Yeah, one time

[Madd Kapp - singing]
I get a funny feelin when I cross over Abner Mountain
Cause when I make it to the fork in the road it's all my relatives' houses
(or should I say trailers)
All the Mullens and the Halls and the Tacketts and all the Johnsons
My grandfather Orwell is a man of the cloth, he says the Lord is watchin
I get a blast from the past when I walk up Caleb Fork
I take a walk to the coal mine to say a little prayer to the Lord
The first time I ever climbed the mountain was with my uncle Jack
Draggin a cooler full of beer with old shoes and no shirt on my back
I wanna go back, I wanna go back
To - 

[Chorus]
God's Country, where the grass is green
and the mountains go as far as the eye can see
In God's Country, where it stays the same
Time moves right along but my heart remains
In God's Country, where the grass is green
and the mountains go as far as the eye can see
In God's Country, where it stays the same
Time moves right along but my heart remains
in God's country

[Madd Kapp - singing]
And God rest the soul of my Papa Lloyd
He never got to see me Candy Ray Mullens youngest boy
The red-headed white boy from the outskirts of Detroit
I love the city as a man but the hallow's in the heart of the boy
I ain't forgot my roots, I need them to stay on track
I love the skyscrapers man but the mountains are callin me back
I wanna go back, I wanna go back
Back to a little place called Weaksbury
So I can sing Country Rose on the porch with my Uncle Ricky
In - 

[Chorus]

[Madd Kapp - singing]
I got a one-way Greyhound bus ticket, hate to fly
The next stop, Ashland Kentucky, cause that's as far as they ride
I got a duffel bag of clothes and a old broken down 4-track
Stoppin at the store on the top of the mountain and man it's good to be back
Can't wait to see my cousins, my Aunt Toe and my Uncle Bud
In the mornin eatin biscuits and gravy and all that Southern grub
I wish my mam-ma was here so I could hear her voice
But I know she's watchin over all the granddaughters and grandboys
(We still here) In - 

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Yeee-HAH~!
That there was a helluva shit
From Kenny Mullens
They call the boy Madd Kapp
But this is just a piece of his story
Stay tuned, stay tuned, next to, one of those, radios, near you
Live from dig it Detroit, Michigan
Hahahaha
Outlaw motherfucker, whattup dere
Whattup Ink, whattup Hank Man
Ah-HAH~!</pre>
