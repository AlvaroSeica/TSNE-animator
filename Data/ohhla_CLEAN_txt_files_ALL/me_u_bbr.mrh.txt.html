[Verse 1 - Diddy]
Been a minute, back up in it
'Bout to lean on it, the thuggin' they love it
When I do my thing on it, the ring leader
The head, heart's, whatchu' want
These dude's couldn't save half of what I flaunt
I'm a terror, N-Y forever, been around the world
I'm New York where ever, I shut it down
Like the gate's was closed, he's the who's-who's
Of what he on, now he know, 'Iller to Illinois
The Bad Boys, keep a couple of toys
And I'm back to Phil'A-Roy, so much swag
He's a style aroma's, the game of pick-up
Whatever I'm done with
Step ahead and I'm sittin' on paper
I'm old dude, with street cred' of a gangsta
So how you want it, you could get it, cause I got it
I ride around, with your life in my pocket

(Cassie, talk to em!)

[Verse 2 - Cassie]
You've been waiting so long
I'm here to answer your call, (This is the remix)
I know that I shouldn't have
Had you waiting at all, (This is the remix, her name is Cassie)
I've been so bu-sy, but I've been thinking 'bout- what I wanna do -

(Ey, yo yo, take it back to the top, take it back from the top right now
ey-yo, Cassie start all over!)

*DJ Scratching*

You've been waiting so long
I'm here to answer your call
I know that I shouldn't have had you waiting at all
I've been so bu-sy, but I've been thinking 'bout- what I wanna do wit you

I know them other guys, they've been talking 'bout the way I do what I do
They heard I was good, they wanna see if it's true
They know your the one I wanna give it to
I can see you want me too
Now it's Me &amp; U

[Chorus - Cassie]
It's Me &amp; U now, (Uh) I've been waiting, (Waitin)
Think I'm gonna make that move now
Baby Tell me if you like it, (Tell me if you like it)
It's Me &amp; U now
I've been waitin
Think I'm gonna make that move now
Baby tell me if how like it

[Verse 3 - Cassie]
I was waitin for you to tell me you were ready
I know what to do if only you would let me
As long as your cool with it I'll treat ya right
Here is where you wanna be

I know them other guys, they've been talkin 'bout the way I do what I do
They heard I was good they wanna see if it's true
They know you are the one I wanna give it to
I can see you want me too
And now it's Me &amp; U

[Chorus - Cassie]
It's Me &amp; U now, (Uh) I've been waiting, (Waitin)
Think I'm gonna make that move now
Baby Tell me if you like it, (Tell me if you like it) (This is the remix)
It's Me &amp; U now, (Bad Boy baby!)
I've been waitin, (Ey-yo Joc!)
Think I'm gonna make that move now
Baby tell me if how like it

[Verse 4 - Yung Joc]
Cassie let me talk to you for a second

Lil mama, when you do it, you do it so well
If you kiss, promise I won't tell
When you make daddy, wanna' rock your bell
Turn off the lights, let my ship set sail
Yell my name, we can take it to the floor
Like to explore, baby go and let it go
The best you ever had, yeah I already know
So tell them other suckers, 'Baby go and hit the door'
And you know I'm for game, baby I been there done that
Young J-O-C, yeah he's that one cat
Let's go and grind, and he make that money stack
Play by play baby just like it runnin' back
Take three call baby come go, with me
We can vacate somewhere, overseas
Just 'Me &amp; U', yeah it's how it's supposed to be
Kick ya' shoes off, baby keep close to me

[Bridge - Cassie]
Baby I'll love you all the way down (Uh)
Get you right where you like it (This is the remix)
I promise you'll like it (I swear) (Yeah_
Just relax and let me make that move (It's our secret babe)
We'll keep it between Me &amp; U (As we proceed)

[Chorus - Cassie]
It's Me &amp; U now, (Uh) I've been waiting, (Waitin)
Think I'm gonna make that move now
Baby Tell me if you like it, (Tell me if you like it)
It's Me &amp; U now
I've been waitin
Think I'm gonna make that move now
Baby tell me if how like it
