Chorus (Kangol Slim):

Come take a walk with the Villains,
And you'll see that I'm down for the killin',
And you'll know that I straight represent,
P-N-C and Black Menace, please don't get it bent,
No mercy, mercy, mercy,
Everybody cannot pump the, pump the party,
We show no mercy, mercy, mercy,
Everybody just follow me, follow me, follow me

(Misdemeanor)
Nigga I will wet'cha, as if I was rain up on a rainy day,
'Cept I don't rain with water, I rains with my rainy K,
Bullets, it don't take nothin' but a sec to pull it,
And release these slugs to your dome piece, now be deceased,
Fuckin' with me is like walkin' over boilin' lava,
Bein' choked by a piece of barbed wire,
Nigga retire, I'm on fire,
Burnin' emcees as if they were standin' ten feet away from the sun,
Nigga ya done,
Buckin' and killin' and robbin' niggas I never did it,
But if a nigga's too close or disrespects he gotta get it,
And they'll be askin' who did it and got away with it,
It's that seventeenth survivor just forget it,
Admit it, B-M and P-N-C love makin' M-O-N-E,
Y, forever gettin' high, do or die

Chorus

(Kangol Slim)
Come take a walk with me, styles I per-fect,
Lyrically I'm gifted, burn ya like an antiseptic,
Gimme the microphone, mic check and I'll wreck it,
The best thing to do is respect it or check it

(Misdemeanor)
Your games are over, I'm shuttin' you down like A-T-F,
I'm bringin' the noise, puttin' it in the octave bass cleft,
Better watch your step, the wrong move'll get you stuck,
Out of luck, and have your life straight fucked,
It's that skinny one, the red one, the big zag,
Fake niggas can't see me, cuz they blind to the facts,
Wise like an owl, got the power to devour,
Destroy cowards, every minute in an hour,
It's my mental, plus my pencil, and my paper,
That make'em catch the vapors, and wanna do a caper,
If you comin', I got the welcome without the thank you,
Here's some Scarface mafia shit, that's gone stank you,
The Partners and the Menace gone be tight to the finish,
We want everything, from potatoes to the spinach,
Green?  We want it all,
Ninety-seven we gone ball,
Whoever don't like it, fuck all y'all

Chorus

(Threat)
Come take a walk with a villain nigga, ain't nothin' to a cap-peelin
Where I'm from, it's either kill or have your nap spillin',
Adapted killin' as a youngsta,
Jack mode niggas and then I tell you 
best to empty your pockets like a dumpster,
Who wants some? Fuckin' with the gun or it's on,
Here's a six feet tomb for you bustas headed home,
Body, dreaded dome, soldier twisted up from the South,
Claimin' Boot Camp til' I die, fuck what you bout,
Playa challenge your will, challenge your steel, bullets start racin
It's the threat, turnin' niggas into a heart patient,
The narcs, chasin' panic and Luciano,
Real niggas with power, others turnin' sour, look,
Hangin' from the tower, it's P-N-C and the menace,
Still bringin' drama, this squad is in it to win it,
Pierce your wig, you finished, niggas become the away,
Fuckin' with the Crescent City killas, this N.O.L.A., nigga!
