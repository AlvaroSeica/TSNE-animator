[Chorus]
I see the joy, I see the pain 
but today we gonna say 
I am on my way 
we look for meaning, don't agree 
but today we're gonna scream 
I am on my way 
too certain, too doubtful 
but for now, we gotta shout 
I am on my way 
same struggle, told separate 
but for now we sing together 
I am on my way 

[Toby]
got to the bus stop so I jumped off 
just got home from a day at work 
as I rushed I just had one thought 
must not be getting paid my worth 
made my journey on the pavement 
that sustained me early remaining sturdy 
underneath my feet every since my day of birth 
stay observant of what pass today for urgent 
seeing the cars speeding across 
the street, the faces worried 
looking in the windows, when the wind blows 
then it takes a turn 
in the beginning they chasing money 
but they end up chasing purpose 
asking the wrong questions just to ask some 
moving fast in any direction just to have one 
problems that you can't face 
putting band aids on at random 
doing anything they can 
not to attend to what they ran from 
the cost of a son in a hospital strung up 
loss of a loved on, lost in a humdrum 
life, a wife that caught her husband 
running off with younger woman 
the problems you wanna run from 
but easy answers leave you stranded 
when the progress is undone 

[Chorus]
I see the joy, I see the pain 
but today we gonna say 
I am on my way 
we look for meaning, don't agree 
but today we're gonna scream 
I am on my way 
too certain, too doubtful 
but for now, we gotta shout 
I am on my way 
same struggle, told separate 
but for now we sing together 
I am on my way 

[Toby]
we all gotta look for meaning 
when we're living through a hell 
but the only meaning that you see 
you give to it yourself 
jewish, muslim, christian, hindu 
send you on that trail 
towards a system you can stick to 
when everything else has failed 
I guess good fortune seems to only go so far 
cause of course we start 
to think we're more important than we are 
painting our own portraits 
from the point of view that's all distorted 
with the thought the world needs us 
in order to revolve 
like we're born with a path you have to follow 
sacrificing half your life 
finding that exact tomorrow 
it never happens like that 
as a matter of fact we all go 
through the habit of adapting goals 
when things go bad and fall through 
it's like playing with dice 
waiting till right numbers come up 
hundred to one odds 
but then we make up lies to cover it up 
purpose is somewhat of a drug 
but other stuff comes with the buzz 
the journey is the purpose 
nothing other than us 

[Chorus]
I see the joy, I see the pain 
but today we gonna say 
I am on my way 
we look for meaning, don't agree 
but today we're gonna scream 
I am on my way 
too certain, too doubtful 
but for now, we gotta shout 
I am on my way 
same struggle, told separate 
but for now we sing together 
I am on my way

hey, hey, hey
