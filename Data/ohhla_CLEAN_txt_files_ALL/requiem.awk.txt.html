[AWKWORD]
I start off with a bang, boom, better than life
Like your pharmacist finally got your medicine right
Until you start to overdose, on the pleasure and pain
And your spine starts tingling, you're feeling a little strange
Now you brush it off your shoulders, take a deep breath
It's better than being sober, puffing up your chest
But your heart beats through it, you're starting to act foolish
Your head is now spinning, you're about to really lose it
Elusive this lucidness, you float like a butterfly
And every track mark's another note of your lullaby
But you take chances, cause that's what being a man is
Plus it's romantic, when you ask God for answers
Please, he'll never say hello to you
I'm the truth and the question, I flow through you
I'm your friends and your family, who don't know you
I'm that picture of sanity, I won't show you

[Chorus Â– AWKWORD, Ess Vee, Jay Daniels &amp; Mark Deez]
I'm your frat party, blow it up your nose, my son
In your Ed Hardy, pour it, tilt, get drunk
Let's get it started, light it, smoke, get dumb
I'm The Requiem, shoot it up ya vein, get numb

I'm your frat party, blow it up your nose, my son
In your Ed Hardy, pour it, tilt, get drunk
Let's get it started, light it, smoke, get dumb
I'm The Requiem, shoot it up ya vein, get numb

[SoulStice]
I'm the answer, I provide a sense a security
I got all y'all convinced of my purity
Give me what you got, all of it preferably
I might give it back when I'm done as a courtesy
I'll numb the pain, no ques', that's a certainty
I'm the man, Monday, you've never heard of me
Tuesday, you will search for me, tryna purchase me
Can't find me, turn the place burgundy
And I was blowing your phone last night
In fact I am why you ain't come home last night
I'm why you lost the J-O, why you gotta lay low
Getting out is over your head, like a halo
Stained white shirt, holes in jeans
First one's free, or so it seems
You can pay me in hopes and dreams
Now gon' drop em in, like a coke machine

[Chorus]

[Ess Vee]
Just call me a pill, I dissolve in your system, right
I'm keepin it real, you need me I'm your rhythm, like
A needle in a vein owned by a fiend he feels the pain
Whether I'm going in or going out you need me to stay sane
Look, I'm your dealer's dream but your neighbor's nightmare
I could make you lean, while you're standing right there
Now, could you just imagine
That I could change your face up, like you running for a pageant
Don't try to understand it, the self-inflicted damage
You mad cause you can't ban it, you can't shake me like a habit
See I'm whiter than a rabbit, or greener than your local park
Now roll me up pass me around make sure your lighters spark
You go from light to dark, they say the freaks come out at night
You need me just to start and now to take it down, right
I got your back, see, I told you not to frown
I'm here to lift you up I can also take you down

[Chorus]

[CuzOH! Black]
I need you, I need you, I need you in the morning
How the hell else would I get my day started?
Really feeling the neglect that you showing me
But it's money power respect that you owing, see
That's all I ask for, problems seem to down pour
Every time I elevate I'm closer to my downfall
My love for you escalating yet still I need to have more
Don't step on me like sidewalk, promise I'll bring back more
I'm at best raw, I can cause war
I'm The Requiem, like I'm AWKWORD
This is absurd, how could you quit me?
I keep you away from pain, away from shame
The rush in your veins, sure cost a little change, damn
Ain't I worth it? why the attitude change, damn?
I was certain, me and you was perfect
Couldn't I take you higher while hitting you until it hurt
