[ VERSE 1: MC Peaches ]
You asked for my number, I looked and walked away
You say, "Gimme the digits," but that's okay
You started tellin everyone you wanted to get with me
Got my number out the phone book, you tricked me
You keep callin, why, what's the reason?
You're not gettin the play cause you're skeezin
You know my man but that's not stoppin you
If he finds out you know he's droppin you
On my strap and barely know my name
Sayin ever since you met me your world has changed
Everyone kept sayin, "Peaches, don't do it"
But I set up a trap and you fell into it
Gased his head till it was ready to burst
He thought that I was God's gift to the universe
So when I left him I left him crushed
Another one bites the dust

(Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone, another one gone
Another one bites the dust
Hey, I wanna get you too
Another one bites the dust)

[ VERSE 2: MC Peaches ]
Drivin a car with a dope sound system
Seen a fly guy, hm, another victim
Parked the car, watched him for a while
And when he spoke to me I just smiled
He complimented me like I knew he would
The fact we were single was well understood
Told him my name, the conversation started
We exchanged numbers beore we departed
Talked on the phone, the friendship grew
He said, "Peaches, I think that I'm in love with you"
I said it's time to step, I don't need to be claimed
Besides, my heart don't have time for the pain
Left him sayin, "Peaches, please don't leave me"
I guess that's why pimpin ain't easy
Stayin ahead of you guys is a must
Oh well, another one bites the dust

(Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone, another one gone
Another one bites the dust
Hey, I wanna get you too
Another one bites the dust)

[ VERSE 3: MC Peaches ]
I walk with a switch but I can do what I want
I talk a good game, don't take it as a front
I be your tenderoni if you rub me the right way
But most mess up cause the games that they play
Quick to diss a man who just don't deserve me
Say go to hell makin sure that he heard me
I'm like a magnet, guys are attracted
They got to calm down cause I'm Peaches and I can't have this
A ugly guy, or he may even be cute
I just soup him up, I don't let him knock my boots
Kiss him and diss him cause it is a must
And by the time I'm through, his ego's crushed
Love's a game and I don't play fair
If you don't like the rules then be outta here
Givin me 100% is a must
And if not, another one bites the dust

(Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone, another one gone
Another one bites the dust
Hey, I wanna get you too
Another one bites the dust)

Yo, guys be buggin
but I'ma let them know
Peaches isn't goin out like that
You step to me wrong and you know it's a must
You'll be another one bitin the dust

(And another one gone, another one gone
Another one bites the dust
Hey, I wanna get you too
Another one bites the dust)</pre>
