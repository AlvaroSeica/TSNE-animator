[Saul Williams]
What's a song if you can't fuck to it?
I want to move deep in the gut of it
And what's the right kind of behavior...  to qualify as someone's savior?
What kind of question is that anyway?
I know I don't deserve your time of day
But since you're giving me some time tonight
Then hold me close, girl, and just squeeze me tight
Raw...
I want to touch you on the other side...  where all your anger, fear, and hurt reside
I want to get to know the part of you that I can crawl inside, the heart of you
Raw...</pre>
