broke, man, if it cost three cents to shit you'd have to throw up. You know 
who own the record.  Man, why don't you sit your ignorant ass down, man, and 
listen.

[Playa Hamm] (DJ Quik)
So is it my turn again? (Yeah nigga it's yours)
Oh I done kick a funky verse for the P-funk? (Of course)
Well count down nigga to end for these fakers
Bet we hit this time and we fade no takers
Who thought the funk was despondent out the Westside
Not be along for the ride (But it's only for the trees)
That's right, so peep the shot
And if I get it hot, baby I'ma rock the twat
Cus aint no party like a party in the Penthouse suite
And you know how we do it, baby, yo Tree
So if the mack of the smack brings fear
Them perpetrators right when they was cowards right from the very start
Pretendin theys the ones that true
But pimp who is they foolin? (Not me or you)
Fools confused, thinking we's on a decline
Cus we kicks the P's and tell 'em about the funk this time

*scratches* Nothing has changed, 
nothing has *scratches* gots to have the funk
*scratches* Nothing has changed, 
nothing has *scratches* gots to have the funk
*scratches* Nothing has changed, 
nothing has *scratches* gots to have the funk
*scratches* Nothing has changed, 
nothing has *scratches* gots to have the funk

[2-Tone]
Comin at that ass again it don't stop
Bust a lean in yo 64 shift, take a hop to the top
Where the hustlas hang out
Endo remains to sprout; ?? knows what I'm talking about
And gets host from my block to your neighborhood
Tell 'em Quik when you know it's back to no good
I wish you would, cus I'm true to this gangsta shit
Now take a Tic Tac, and bust 'em like a hoe in the hood, bitch
Took my endz ho
They say it's never enough you know?
I gots to have mo'
But I'ma shake the spot infact
I just jacked his trick and his fo' so I can crack-a-lack
And straight P-funk anytime
It's only right you peeped the rhyme, I got to take mine
Check yo ass with the shit that stank
Cus 2-Tone came to the game, aint a damn thang changed

*scratches* Nothing has changed, 
nothing has *scratches* gots to have the funk
*scratches* Nothing has changed, 
nothing has *scratches* gots to have the funk
*scratches* Nothing has changed, 
nothing has *scratches* gots to have the funk
*scratches* Nothing has changed, 
nothing has *scratches* gots to have the funk

[Kam]
It's the 1 to the 9 with the 9 to the 4
When I thought you knew the drill, but you still don't hear me though
Kam and Watts up, from the grass roots
No daisy duke shit, knockin crazy ass boots
Nigga please, we kick it like G'z
Puttin down work when I lurk don't even sneeze (Fuck the Goldies)
That's just the Eastside way of getting chips
When your raise up chillin with the dogs and the rips
New cars get tagged, ridas get wrecked
Niggas caps get peeled back, and chins get checked
Don't expect no love, boy, no apology
Kids aint fallin for yo child psychology
In 9 and 4 mindin yo business is the best bitch
Screamin 'Watts riot' we aint even made a mess yet
Ya shouldn't speak with a weak heart
You gots to finish everything you start
And aint a damn thang changed

*scratches* Nothing has changed, 
nothing has *scratches* gots to have the funk
*scratches* Nothing has changed, 
nothing has *scratches* gots to have the funk
*scratches* Nothing has changed, 
nothing has *scratches* gots to have the funk
*scratches* Nothing has changed, 
nothing has *scratches* gots to have the funk

[Hi-C]
Now niggas transform like deceptive cons
We'll slice your ass up like Jeffrey Don
Quik drop bombs on the P-funk tip
Even though a nigga rap you'll still get that ass whipped
Please don't slip, aint a damn than changed
Numb yo ass up like some nova cane
Have you all fucked up like you smoked some loot
Hi-C still sippin pussy like soup
We got Kam, Hamm, New D, and Quik
And me myself, mista big dick
No I might not know which bitch that I want
But I know on thing I *scratch* <got funk="" have="" the="" to="">
From ya speaker and not from ya ass
Cus some of y'all bitches just wont take baths
Hand picked niggas just can't me tang
Cus we true to the game
And aint a damn thang changed

*scratches* Nothing has changed, 
nothing has *scratches* gots to have the funk
*scratches* Nothing has changed, 
nothing has *scratches* gots to have the funk
*scratches* Nothing has changed, 
nothing has *scratches* gots to have the funk
*scratches* Nothing has changed, 
nothing has *scratches* gots to have the funk
