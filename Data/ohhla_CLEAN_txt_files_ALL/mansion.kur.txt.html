[Sadat X]
Yeah, check this out, y'all, Sadat X, Mike G, Kurious Jorge
and the whole squad up in here, what? Listen, listen

I'm a do this right here for my main man Jorge
Said bring some old school, so I brought some leather Docs
Sadat X here, from the 120 blocks
In Harlem, uptown breeds stardom

[Mike G]
Mike G, JB's, puff the L, get ??? up the honey gets tuned up
Because the Jimmy had the dream to write the rhyme
Rip the beat up, that uptown shit will make you ampede up, yo yo

[Kurious]
Yo yo, get with this shit, it's the hit to make you fumble
Just a Nubian Constipated Monkey in the Jungle
Humble rap, peep the thermostat, shit be hot
Kurious the magician got a mansion and a yacht

	[Chorus]
	We came to rock it, don't stop it
	Because the party has begun
	So come on females get on the dance floor
	And the fellas have some fun

[Kurious]
Ah check it out, my dimetion's esquisite, I invite you to visit
Is it the shit that I be doing, brewing in your crew with my rhyme blizzard
Hit you in the head can't stop it
Dropping jewels like a thief with a hole in his pocket

[Mike G]
No doubt remedies antidotes cutthroats choke
&gt;From her be hands hitting your throat, don't front check your coat
We came to have a ball, Sadat X on point
Mick make your call

[Sadat X]
It's like water clear flows, the group that I take
Can't be taken by a softball heads and low cuts
&gt;From the prime stock ??? around the block
Rarely weed smoking, never catch the pocket dred
Mine be line with the thing for the head, it's like that, yo

	[Chorus]
	We don't wanna be left behind
	All we wanna do is just blow your mind
	We don't wanna be left behind
	All we wanna do is just blow your mind
	Just one more time

[Sadat X]
Here we go like this, check it
It's getting late and I'm a burst
I gotta get uptown to my own compound
Give a call to my lady, heat up the dinner
Hey Jorge you know how we do, I'm a see you in a few
Mike G, my man, it was great
Peace to New York State, and hard working New Yorkers
Step on the trash talkers slid on a pair of British Walkers
Sadat X I got the fright of pride
My shit is hot, kid think not?
&gt;From Melrose to Patterson, Lexington to Madison
Mecca on 8, the 45th on the corner
All getting props, the kid with black Nike high tops
The veteran of the 4 train strain
I like to rhyme but the ??? in the rain

[Mike G]
Come on, taste it don't waste it
It's gonna catch it, just face it
New York connect make you do a head check
But now go and get pet
Because the crowd is select K. Jorge
Made out the touch tone, mad sessions was done, bones
Hypertone, blown headphones it feels good
The flow's endless, torturous, feel full bless
I hold my firece, K. Jorge rip the mic
Til the beat is dismissed like that y'all

[Kurious]
Well I was walking through the jungle with a stick in my hand
And if bland is how it stands right according to plan
We be getting iller, Manilla, now we provide the thriller
Watch a Constipated Monkey pound his chest like a gorilla
Nowadays people praise be bugging
Think I got mad loot, it's sad, I'm glad, fuck what you think
I'm cute, whatever, but if you was clever
You'd know I'm broker than the brokest and I'm uglier than ever
Precise like ice, I slid in cool
Big Cotta, Lord Sear, Prince from Powerule
Highly pleasurable, like having sex
I'm cracking Becks with Mike G, playing Madam with X

"Don't stop rocking to the rhythm cause I get down" (Repeat til fade)
