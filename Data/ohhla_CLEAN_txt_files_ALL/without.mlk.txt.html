[Chorus]
It's great without ya
fucked without ya
right without ya
(you know I'm great mama)
great without ya
date without ya
night without
(you know I'm straight)
It's great without ya
I don't have to fight without ya
(yea)
It's great but nothing god ever see your face again

[Verse 1: Black Milk]
She was A-1, when I met her on day one
day 2 and 3 dates, movies, eat
day 4 she looking hot as the Earth's core
plus when we met up
she would get wetter than surfboards
now anytime we met or chilled
clothes came off stayed off
except for stilleto heels
but now we cant finish endless
told her get a grip trick
attitude flip like a gymnast
spending time always on my grind
got her mad at the same time
she wanna lot of cash wit Prada bags
now we're different tried to put you in front
I guess I misunderstood this one
used to have you pinned up
til you drove me to pick up
where I left off when I picked up pimp cup
wit a pimp strut yea I'm outta
had something new but who knew
that I could do without her
yea

[Chorus]
It's great without ya
fucked without ya
right without ya
(you know I'm great mama)
great without ya
date without ya
night without
(you know I'm straight)
It's great without ya
I don't have to fight without ya
(yea)
It's great but nothing god ever see your face again

[Verse 2]
and I'm good without the stress from you
but still got haters and naysayers
trying to stress me too
but play like they ain't feel the dude
talk a lot but I'm not hearing them
like my ears were mute
even close friends talk and leave
won't be around when it all falls down
like when Lauryn sings
got more to bring
got more friends now
that wasnt around when I couldnt afford the bling
but its just part the game
now I'm more smarter these days
laugh at em when the haters, hate
cause I'm straight without em
Im making more cake without em
I'm overseas back to the states without em
chicks wanna date without em
I get on stage fans go ape without em
see, so whoever was doubting my fight
It feels great cause you not in my life
aight, good night

[Outro]
when the haters gettin mad at us
all we do is laugh at em
I'm saying...

and if you starting acting crazy baby
on the daily
yo you know
I'm saying

Black Milk, Colin Monroe
LET'S GO</pre>
