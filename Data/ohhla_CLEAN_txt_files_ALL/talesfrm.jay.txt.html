Tales from the dope side

[ VERSE 1: Kool Rock Jay ]
Jay is dope, I mean as dope as dope gets
Cold flyin heads and makin hits
You wouldn't move or budge till I started
But from the mic suckers departed
That's not the tip that's hip, the tip is this
To make you move to the 12-inch disc
And you can't stop the Rock while I'm rollin
You need another hobby, so start bowlin
Breakin it down like a mathematician
Beein exact with fact, and yo, no fiction
Holdin it tight, treatin it right
Puttin up a shine, don't touch the mic
Cause I got a rhyme of mine you can't handle
Burn you at both ends, friends, like a candle
Kool Rock Jay's in the place to be
And you can't f-u-c-k with me

[ VERSE 2: Kool Rock Jay ]
Let's go deep in depth as the concept is kept
The place with the bass where the Rock will wreck
You can't stop this, you can't mock this
Jay is here to show you just what hip-hop is
I don't stop till I rock and I roll you
Sooner or later you understand I control you
With this hip-hop jam that's in my mind
Devastatin all suckers with a dope rhyme
Comin to a party ( ? )
Make it sound sweet for all you ( ? )
When you listen, boy, I'm from the dope side, tell it
Tell the sucker MC's are rebellin
While the record's sellin, smart at school
Bein cool and I know the ruels
Terrorizin suckers from block to block
And Jay won't stop till I reach the top

[ VERSE 3: Kool Rock Jay ]
Yo, you know, check out the flow
Of a super dope MC about to go
To a realm, a land, another dimension
So sit back, relax and pay attention
Slice do the scratchin, Jay do the rappin
Hittin you close so you don't know what's happenin
Back to back party's packed, just like that
Step off, jack
I come clear to make sure you understand the point
Kool Rock Jay's the joint
I'm def by law and dope by music
Rhymin on the mic because I choose it
To terrorize punks just like this
Breakin it down on a 12-inch disc
The Kool Rock, the place, the party - MC's wanna roll?
I don't think so

[ VERSE 4: Kool Rock Jay ]
Talent on the mic, that's right, I'm displayin it
See what I'm sayin when I'm sayin cause I'm sayin it
Day by day, yo, and week by week
I'm tearin suckers away for the way I speak
Terrorizer, make you realize'a
No one's higher when you say sire
To the MC rockin the mic
Like that that's right because I'm never polite
To a sucker, I mean a sucker explainin you
Cause you're a sucker and now you're through
I'm Kool Rock Jay and I don't play
Born the 21st of May in '68
Ready to rhyme on time off my mind
Ask your boy how he's doin, yo, I'm feelin fine
Tearin suckers apart
So no slippin after dark

(Damn that shit was dope) --&gt; Dr. Dre</pre>
