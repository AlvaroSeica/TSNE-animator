Where is he??
How the hell would I know...

[Remedy]
A gang of mob pirates, busted by the feds
Just like that, one rat told on ten heads
Before that, they had a pact to get bread
Now it's all done and said
They hit 'em with the RICO Act, investigation
Racketeering Influenced Corrupt Organization
Ah, fuck, the crew's boss is out of luck
Stuck, no more racking in the bucks, sucks, plus
Regardless, got 'em on a whole sleuth of charges
Doing dirt, moving work, taking out the garbage
Name the price, rob a bank, do a heist
Feed the fam, cut a slice, take a shot, roll the dice
GPS tracking device, family associates
Wire taps, rats and the mice
Possessing in extortion, drug operations
Racketeering, robbery, assault and home invasions
Plan to murder a man who direspected
Six figure loan, shark and debts, when I'm collected
Tens of thousands, twenties and hundreds
Soldiers and runners, guns with no serial numbers
Ambitious, criminals scheme by all means
The obsession, possession of a weapon
Watch out, canary rats start singing
And rolled up, turned coat, stool pigeon

[Hook: Remedy]
Imagine that, one of your brothers
Decides to rat, on all the others
Imagine that, one of your brothers
Decides to rat, on all the others

[Chorus 2X: Remedy]
Real men are born and bred from the Staten
Where they go wrong, man, how did it happen
Damn for so long, we never thought he was acting
He was singing songs, all along he was ratting

[Hook]
