(*talking*)
OK, if you'll all gather around, ane be real good
I'll tell you the story about, the alien child
And how he came to be, on this planet here with us
Listen...
 
[K-Rino]
Way off in the galaxy, far away
There was a planet in dissaray, and total dismay
A sinister circumstance, and a retched display
The population terrorized, by a killer named K
The wisdom of the whole world, was kept in a book
For only the king to read, no others could look
K snook in through the castle, took a leak on the lawn
Before anyone could respond, he and the book was gone
Took it to a cave, at an unreachable height
Memorized three thousand pages, in only one night
The light came on, rays shot from his face
He had aquired the ability, to conquer the place
He wasted no time, ravaging life with his hand
Overthrew the world rulers, and took over the land 
With every second that he studied it, his power increased
And all he kept saying, was this book is a beast

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-oooooh, ooh-ooh-ooooh
It's the alien baby, baby
 
[K-Rino]
His reign had lasted, two centuries and then
A secret congregation, developed among men
One guy said, think as hard as you can
So we can come up with a plan, to get rid of this man
A lady walked in, before the plotting could start
Y'all have seemed to forgotten, the most monotonous part
She said he's bound to put an end, to the gossiping men
Don't you know he's got the book, you can't possibly win
The meeting ajourned, everybody sadly moved on
The lady left and transformed, it was K all along
But a old man walked up, with plans for the task
He said, there's one thing K doesn't know that this book has
A pamphlet, consisting of only one page
With the power to disengage, evil at any stage
They said if that book is real, he already killed it
The man opened up his coat, and light beamed and he revealed it
 
[Hook - 2x]
 
[K-Rino]
Heaven's a mergatroid, what the hell low and behold
When he opened the book, winds started blowing in cold
He started chanting (ay-ay-ay-ay-ay), a language unknown
Then his voice lowered deeper, to a dangerous tone
He was summoning, the book's destruction for an hour
A guy stood skeptical, and doubted his power
As the doubter thought, all of this is faking as mine
The man looked right at him, told him no it's not and kept trying
He collapsed, he woke and said the planet is saved
If you looking to find K, he's out cold in a cave
Soldiers rushed up to capture him, bombarded the entrance
Starving for vengeance, but all they saw was an infant
They said he got away, the planet's in trouble
No he didn't, he's the baby in the oblong shuttle
Sentence to start over, be no kindred of you
And there's a planet called Earth, that we're sending him to
The little shuttle was prepelled, through the darkness of space
Past lightspeed, sped at a remarkable pace
Like a meteor it hit the ground, and shook up the land
In South Park, they found a baby with a book in his hand
