[Intro: Kryme Life]
Aiyo, give me some muthafucking elbow room, man
Give me some elbow room, watch out, watch out, nigga
I got something to say, check it out, right
All my real niggas out there, what's up, nigga
From coast to coast, hood to hood
They gon' feel this shit

[Kryme Life]
Yo, seem like we came up, so quick, so fast
On the road to the riches, nigga, fuck rags
Fresh threads for them bitches, straight out the bags
Popping tags, ripping wood, mashing on the gas
It's all real in the field, four-four mags
Stashed right under the wheel, niggas know the drill
Big city life, blow hard for that skrill
Legs keep running til my hands touch a mill
Those flows keep coming, thoughs are more ill
Offers more deals, they still can't off us
Cross us, more kills, beats knocking 'em dead
Pound for pound, the hood put a tag on my head
We get down, get down, thoroughbreds, repping New York City
For Staten Island, I'mma keep the borough fed
This for my Verrazano villains and them Ferry kids
And all my niggas rolling heavy, screaming let me live

[Chorus: Kryme Life]
Y'all niggas may be stars, but I earned my stripes
From going hard, nah, I didn't blow overnight
I don't hate niggas just erase niggas for the cause
I paid the cost to be the boss, I earned the right
Then burned ya likes, all my life
I've been struggling, searching for the light, yeah, I'mma brawl
Even with my back against the wall
Yo, I paid the cost to be the boss, I earned my stripes

[Kryme Life]
Kryme down for whatever, think clever, move swift
All black leathers, seventeen in the desert
When you feel these hot ones, it wont be pleasant
After you get popped, dunn, you won't be present
Even, everybody start ducking or bleeding
Fuck it, acting like they ain't budging or leaving
See how quick niggas go from, thugging to pleading
At the services, your love ones, hugging and grieving
You was on the block screwing, now you up in the precint
Yeah, I know what you doing, info releasing
What part of the game you playing, we leave all rats to hang
A shell for every letter in the name
Niggas ain't respecting the game, alot of you don't get respect
Cuz you lame, playing, and it's a shame
Yeah, I'm sharp enough to screw all you dummies, it's Kryme Life
Call me Blue Dollars cuz I stay cool getting money

[Chorus]

[Kryme Life]
I'm in the club, it's big toast in the house
Muthafuckas better watch they mouth, in a second you can get seven
Street don status, wish you had it
Make niggas kiss the ring now get embarassed
Still repping, niggas tried to jerk me on my cream
2000, six years later, still selling dreams
You cowards see how I'm moving, nigga, I got the team
We produce hit records, my niggas got the gleam
You fun boys wanna step in the game like you established
Turn around, now they on they asses
I'm just laughing, shit happens
Niggas said they want the belt, then come grab it
Guaranteed I bust ya cabbage for the rabbits
Cut my food up like carrots, ain't nothing new
Nothing else to do but bag it, then we make it all disappear like magic
We do it first

[Chorus]</pre>
