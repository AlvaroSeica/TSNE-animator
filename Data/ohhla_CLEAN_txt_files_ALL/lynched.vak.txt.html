(Anybody know who Willie Lynch was?
Anybody?
Raise your hand?
No one?
He was a vicious slave owner in the West Indies
The slave masters in the colony of Virginia were having trouble controlling their slaves
so they sent for Mr. Lynch to teach them his methods
The word lynching came from his last name)  --&gt; Denzel Washington as Melvin B. Tolson in 'The Great Debaters'

[ VERSE 1 ]
The year is 1712, the Lord sent me a vision
Carvin in niggas' brains a gently incision
A prominent psychological dominance, most ominous
But effective enough to force you niggas to honor us
My invention's better than a tree and a rope
Seein I wrote this to shatter they freedom and hope
My first point of control starts
Moldin the younger slaves' cold hearts against the elderly cohorts
Divide 'em all up by plantation status
Till they fully forget the slave master race matters
Expose difference in intelligence, size and sex
Skin shape, pigmentation utilizin necks
It seems this has the most wide effect
Cause the light of the skin to a nigga now provides a threat
And I've got to be proven wrong
I can show you better than I could tell you, let's move along

[ CHORUS ]
I am self-hate, I am the source of wars
Now I'm money, fame and Source Awards
I'm the unseen hand that forces yours
I am Lynch, I am Lynch
(Talk to 'em)
I am self-hate, I am the source of wars
Now I'm money, fame and Source Awards
I'm the unseen hand that forces yours
I am Lynch, I am Lynch

[ VERSE 2 ]
The year is 19... fuck it, the 1960s
Black power movement ( ? )
Panther Party's the answer, probably
Did it slow a 400-year calculated cancer? Hardly
Infiltrated by Central Intelligence
Divide-and-conquer doctrine got more instrumental and relevant
Went from hood to self monetary gain
But after the dope the fall of the monastery came
Which broke the Panthers into subdivisions
Color coded like Crip and Blood envisioned, fragmented to street gangs
Some dumb religion with government backing
And the have-nots ( ? )
So what was once a plantation now a block radius
Gang color wars escalated when the '80s hit
If I'm lyin then prove me wrong
I can show you better than I could tell you, let's move along

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 3 ]
Welcome to the wonderful world of the 1990s
Niggas is bling-blingin and life seem shiny
My influence more prevalent now, it never wore down
Created coastal wars for irrelevant crowns
Erase two of the biggest kings off the chess board
I'm the scientist of this so-called East-West war
Division regional with no exits
Or co-exist or willing to make decisions reasonable
For I have seen the mountain top
And it involves more senseless carnage now that the South is hot
I'm prayin Nas go at Jeezy
I want 50 to murk Weezy
I patronize doin dirt easy
Wonder how bloody a East vs. South gets
After Big and Pac niggas ain't figured me out yet
And I have yet to be proven wrong
I can show you better than I could tell you, let's move along

[ CHORUS ]

(His methods were very simple, but they were diabolical
Keep the slave physically strong but psychologically weak and dependent on the slave master
Keep the body, take the mind)  --&gt; Denzel Washington as Melvin B. Tolson in 'The Great Debaters'</pre>
