Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Got my bitch she shot gun
A pizza and a cola
While she play her position in the mirror watching them rollers
And I'm smoking the potent
Driving roasted like it's stolen
On the road to the riches if you wonder where I'm goin
I make a fortune from flowing
It's gonna happen I know it
Fool I told you so
Don't be surprised cause I'm rollin
Few styles been stolen
Don't think that I haven't noticed
But a couple of nuggets ain't much to this fucking grower
I can get you some morer
This audio dope
I got what chu need plus way morer
Underneath the floorboards
I represent no love
Suckas get no love
Homie only no others he don't really know us
Momma have that rolled up before I roll over
Jet life best life
Good mornings wild nights
It's flashing lights
Racing stripes
If her head right
I got no problem booking her flight</pre>
