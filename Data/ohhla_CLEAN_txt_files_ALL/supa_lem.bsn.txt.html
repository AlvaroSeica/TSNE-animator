D-Town westside, Yea I said it westside
But they yellin Big so much, You would thought it's bedstie
You are now fuckin with the newest nigga best out
Gon' and roll that weed nigga (Why) Cuhz I'm stressed out
L.B checked out, Bad bitch chest out (them titties)
No wonder why misses right just keeps on gettin left out
Oh well that's everything I'm not concernin (fuck it)
I'm on the top floor gettin brains, Higher learnin
Gettin higher earnins and my desires yearnin
Runnin through that paper (What) like my Attourney
100 blunts rolled, You can smell the fire burnin
I'm in the fast lane, You can smell my tires burnin
Exercise, Flex on guys, Model chick
Sex on thighs, bubble eyed lexus drive, I might let Alexis drive
Jesus chain, testify, I over Accessorize
Test her out na she gon need a stretcher when I stretch her out
When it's time to speak man all of ya'll listen, When you up in the party
Man why is all the broads missin, And I just drop lines
Like a nigga goin fishin, Man and I be on them posters like a nigga gon missin
And I spit (Scratch) that retarded shit, Just call it autism
And I'm so hollywood that I might make yo bitch audition
For me, Cut-Cut, (yuh) movie time cut, Look I'm a dick her dooowwwnnn, You gon
Pick her up
Yup
And I'm unusual as shit, I am superbad yo girl prolly
Doodlin my dick, And it's a couple screws up in my head that
Could use a fuckin wrench, and I'm jus lookin at the game like they can use
A fuckin bench, (bitch) and my name all up in the rafters, She gon
Make me cum, but I bet that money come faster, Kanye first
Then I'm comin after, and louieVaton shoes hoe
Dawns and the jaspers, Who, her, I ran through her walls
Made her scream and disapear, But hell naw my name is not casper
Boy, What the fuck these rappers sound like, Ha just a whole bunch of my sound bites
First whip Garbo, Second whip Largo, Don't
Worry bout my niggas they're good, Marshall
Bank account got me feelin well, Fargo
Ballin 'till I get a millicicc, Darco
I just give em line afta line, afta line Afta line, afta line, Bar codes
They lookin for my work, Narco, Cuhz I just blackout in the booth
Charcoal, Me, Don, C, Tone and 54 bitches, The seeds finna blow
I bet they finna blow nigga, 2 pounds of weed don't act like you don't nigga
I put that green up like missle toe nigga
Yeah
I do it
