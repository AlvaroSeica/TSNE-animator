[introduction by Andre]
Hello, well good evening ladies and gentlemen
What we like to do right here, well first let me let you know who I am
Well I go by the name of Andre3000 alright?
And we come from a little place called like Stankonia, Georgia right?
You know right now everybody wants to be from space
And folks like to be from the country and everything like that
You know, like really like the South is like cool to be
from the South right about now, girls listen up

[Andre]
Torn between Saturday night and early Sunday mornin'
I don't know, I'm somewhere stuck in between-tween
I'm out here knowin' hip-hop is dead
The average nigga on my corner yellin' what the fuck you mean-mean
See we ain't even seen the mountain top
Counter-clock wise goes the neighborhood
Hand me downs and canned goods, won't cut the Grey Poupon
We got to make you run, back to the drawing board can't afford to lose
Y'all make me yawn, one, slash one slash ninety-one
My teacher sees potential in me said sit down son
And let me tell you like I heard it when I felt deserted
It wadn't no other way to word it got my feelings murdered
By the, bullet of bad, the singer of sad
Songs to make you long for your mom and your dad
Plaid clash with polka dots, I hope you ain't mad
Back up little mama I'm about to react

[Chorus]
Yup, we ain't just funkin' around, ah-ah
No, you don't want to see me clown, ah-ah
No, tomorrow sounds like right now, ah-ah

[Bridge]
People have ya party, but please dont be late
Its to bounce rock roller-skate, bounce rock roller-skate
Hey sexy mama, there's no time to waste
Its to bounce rock roller-skate, bounce rock roller-skate
Grab yo partner, roll around, and feel the sound, ah baby
People have ya party, dont be late
Its to bounce rock roller-skate, bounce rock roller-skate

[Big Boi]
While Scotty is beamin', lil' Pookie'nem schemin'
What's the use of living my nigga, while you snoozing I'm dreamin'
I'm Tylenol PM, you amount to the same thing everyday like per diem
Never tryin' to be nothing but a damn what you're being
One nation under the cool should be the rule
Wether young man or young lady begins or starts grade school
Silence before violence, nine times out of ten times the quietest is the livest
Fumblin' through your privates, Daddy Fat Sacks can they have your back
Naw! Ooh! You're such a playa, Ohh! your Southern ball
Got me sprawled out, in ya black book my name was crossed out
Went from starting the second string now in the dog house *WROOF*
Remenicing, the party was missing
Instead of arguements you think about the hugs and kisses
If this is something hard for you to take
you better bounce, rock, roller skate

[Chorus]

[Repeat first line of Chorus]
