[ VERSE 1: Breeze ]
Well yo, some like to sing this, I rather hum this
Kick the beat with the help from the drum sticks
Add a snare a clap to enhance the rap
I never forfeit, get off it, step back
Attack a track like a linebacker, I got rhymes that'll
Cut the small talk, chit-chatter, it doesn't matter
If you're queen or prince or even a king
It's hard to figure a way to believe in these things
Goin through tracks and flowin through raps poorly
Tellin you it's time for you to kneel before me
I'm not dissin, just eliminatin waste
You didn't get the hint, I meant talkin shit
Excuse the beat but I refuse to sleep upon
Labels sellin a dream yeah right, come on
You couldn't break the kid, now took a look
And while you're sittin there kickin yourself, son, watch the hook

Watch the
(Hook)
(Hook)
(Hook)

[ VERSE 2: Breeze ]
Watch the hook, it's designed to catch ya and get ya
Don't try to stray away cause your body won't let ya
And I bet ya by the end of the lecture
You get the picture and soon forget ya
Favorite, you stay with it long, and just
When you thought I fell off I came strong and bust
A def LP, please Lord help thee
To just stay healthy and live life healthy
Stay in a state where I can't wait to make
Something for ya to feel my aura
Hopin I'm dope'n then I start provokin
Cause I get ill when the music soaks in
Then automatically I rhyme at random
The track and my rap - what a tandem
It didn't take long for me to cook
Now your heart's been took
Now just stop and look
To watch the hook

Watch the
(Hook)

[ VERSE 3: Breeze ]
The hook is like a knock-out blow
Somethin I throw to let you know
I don't play games, so keep your distance
Cause I'm persistent, on you, for instance
I take aim and if you're fiendin I'll be your dope
You wanna hang? Here's your rope
But don't choke ( ? ) or fess or come up, prepare for
An everlasting tongue-lashin smashin the floor
The hook is like ( ? ) and you're co-starring
You got tricked and dicked so stick to sparring
Follow your shadow cause I never had no
Intentions on dissin, it's the point that you're missin
Must I remind you I'm designed to flow
React to the rappin, adapt to the tempo
So before I loc'ed up I'm glad you woke up
You woulda got broke up
Watch the hook</pre>
