Uh huh
C I aint afraid to let the whole world know
Know what I'm sayin
You could call me bow wow
But tonight.. I'm Lamborghini Moss
Real special occasion you know?
And Pain
Lets go get em again hommie

[Bow Wow]
Lil mama bad man she fine she a dime she a problem
Bedroom time boy I make her yell like the khaled
So hood check her swag I'm like anything you can have
Rent american express get what you want got every bag
Niggas mad say I'm symmin her gurls think she trippin
We don't even feed into that bull like jordan and pimpin
Don't be trippin when she or he be at the club with other woman
when I be out on tour she be the only thing I'm missin
Late night she hit my sidekick like bow come over
Treat her like the 4th quarter and put that D on her
She put up with all my bullshit and all of my drama
And I kno that she one because I let her meet my mama

[T-Pain]
She's my
And when I'm gone girl I miss ya
can't nobody do me like you shawty
She's my only love
She's my (only love)
She's my
She hold me down everybody know she model around town
She's my only love
C that's my girl I aint afraid to let the whole world know

[Bow Wow]
Niggas try to holla but she know they lame
Can't no other nigga do it like this mane
I done been with a lot of gurls in my lifetime
but this right here this a real thang
I spoil her adore her give her cash to go the malla
My ride or die my down ass like destiny I'm her soldier
When she be feelin down I give her love and I mean all of it
And she my lil bust it baby like neyo and plies and them
Look good when she walk around my crib in them boys shorts, wife beat
And when I lick that spot c she get real moist
catered food on the jets me and her be taking trips
Passports full of stamps been there every continent
she all my and she so fine and girls like this so hard to find
that's why I knew first day I saw her shit I had to make her mine

[T-Pain x2]
She's my
And when I'm gone girl I miss ya
can't nobody do me like you shawty
She's my only love
She's my (only love)
She's my
She hold me down everybody know she model around town
She's my only love
C that's my girl I aint afraid to let the whole world know uh un</pre>
