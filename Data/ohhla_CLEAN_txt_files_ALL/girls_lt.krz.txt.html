[Intro]
Everything looks good when you're wavy
The way she movin  like she wanna make a baby
Nigga get a little closer if you can't see
What they like? Well you fuck up on the KC

[Bridge]
Hey! I think she want me
She put her booty all on me
Knew it fore she looked this way
And I was like hey

[Verse 1]
Jiggling and like it's way been hold up
Girl I sleep on that thing, it's like a pillow
So much heat, she could roast a marshmallow
She getting cheese from the fellows with the jellow
She could juggle that, make a poor man pat his pockets
When he struggling, with 2 hands she smuggling
You couldn't palm with that biggest hand
That way she dance, I make her stressin like in her pants
And her back in, back in
Actin like you smack it
It's attracting that shit without even a Ruskin
Okay! Feel like a pervert
Try to make eye contact
I trip down on her skirt
Damn!

[Chorus]
I like a girl with a big booty
She like to back it up and give it to me
She stand still and it keep movin
Like that? Like that? What you doing?
I like girls like that (like that)
I like girls like that (like that)
I like girls like that (like that)
Turn around and do the no hand clap like

[Verse 2]
Biiitch, stop playin, real niggas on deck
So bounce both ass cheeks like a bad check
Go to church, pay your ties, praise the Lord cause she blessed
The way she on the floor, she bounce like she having sex woah
Holy moley, do er like you know me
Make that ass go dumb, word to my nigga 40
You say you're bout it bout it
You know we in to show me
I ain't never been a trick, but yo body worth a Rolly
My new chick from Texas, butt big like precious
I floss her in public, that stunt on my X's
She bring her BFF, we eat raw for breakfast
I like girls who like girls  see that's just my preference
Put yo number in my iPhone if you a freak
Play yo cards right, I party but you're booting me

[Chorus]
I like a girl with a big booty
She like to back it up and give it to me
She stand still and it keep movin
Like that? Like that? What you doing?
I like girls like that (like that)
I like girls like that (like that)
I like girls like that (like that)
Turn around and do the no hand clap like

[Verse 3]
Okay... no hands, she ain't using no hands
She gotta turn to the owner
Strip club, I'm wishin I'm the owner
Coming every night with a fistful of cheese
Come in by yo self, it's Kali you leavin with
Know you got band, know you got kids
If you need tips, know you got Krizz
Cause you got a cute baby face and a grown woman body
Gotta taste holy good, God Almighty
Got a good team, need a new coach
Oh what I mean, I'm all for that choch
What I seen with the stream but her ass so fat
Nothing but a tease but I like that

[Chorus]
I like a girl with a big booty
She like to back it up and give it to me
She stand still and it keep movin
Like that? Like that? What you doing?
I like girls like that (like that)
I like girls like that (like that)
I like girls like that (like that)
Turn around and do the no hand clap like

[Outro]
Everything looks good when you're wavy
The way she movin  like she wanna make a baby
Nigga get a little closer if you can't see
What they like? Well you fuck up on the KC</pre>
