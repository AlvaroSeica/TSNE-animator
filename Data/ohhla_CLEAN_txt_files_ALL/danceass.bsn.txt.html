[Chorus] w/ (ad-libs)
Ass, ass, ass, ass, ass, ass, ass, ass, ass, ass, ass
Ass, ass, ass, ass, ass, ass, ass, ass, ass, ass, ass
Stop... now make that motherfucker hammer time like
Go stupid, go stupid, go stupid... 

[Verse 1]
Wobble-dy wobble-dy, wa-wobble, wobble
I'm st-stacking my paper my wallet look like a bible
I got girlies half naked, that shit look like the grotto
How your waist anorexic and then your ass is colossal
Like WHOOP! Drop that ass, make it boomerang
Take my belt off, bitch I'm Pootie Tang
Tippy taow, tippy tay, you gon' get a tip today
Fuck that, you gon' get some dick today
I walk in with my crew and I'm breaking they necks
I'm looking all good, I'm making her wet
They pay me respect they pay me in checks
And if she look good she pay me in sex (Do it)
Bounce that ass (ass), it's the roundest (roundest)
You the best (best), you deserve a crown bitch
Right on that...

[Chorus] w/ (ad-libs)

[Verse 2]
Stop! drop it, drop it
You got everybody in here "Oh my gosh-ing"
Bad bitces I'm your da-da, white girls go gaga
When it sticks out they bust it open, like yaya is a pinata
Bitch look down, tell me what's up
Girl you talk to much, shut up
I got that mad dick you know it always nut up
And it got a attitude no wonder why it's stuck up
Pop it then back up, yo gymnastics got me ecstatic
Your whole crew look like a pageant I'm dropping cash tip and some taxes
WHOOP! (Do it) Girl you got me about to pass out
I'm wondering if cupid gave you ass shots
'Cause I'm in love with that...

[Chorus] w/ (ad-libs)

[Bridge] w/ (ad-libs)
White girls, Black girls
Tall girls, fat girls
Shake that ass, (shake that ass), shake that ass, (shake that ass)
Shake that ass, (shake that), shake that ass
Short girls, small girls 
Skinny girls, all girls
Shake that ass, (shake that ass), shake that ass, (shake that ass)
Shake that ass, (shake that), shake that ass
And I want all of that...

[Chorus] w/ (ad-libs)

Go STUPID! {*echoes until fade*}</pre>
