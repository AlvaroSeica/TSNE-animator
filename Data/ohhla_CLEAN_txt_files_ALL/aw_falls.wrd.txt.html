[Werd]
What do you do when it all falls down
And you aint got nothing but some raw hot tunes
Thought that you make it real real soon
Then you get to the point where it all falls down
And you got nothing to say
only reason that you rap got nothing to dae
To make things worse you got nothing to play
All the shit that you liked it was back in the day
When the years pasted on you werent up to date
And the younger generation starting taking your place
You noticing now that it aint that great
And all rap is man is hip hop thats fake
So how much can you take
Before you pick up a mic and start telling them straight
This is not just music this is not a rhyme
These are dark days but I'm ready to shine

I used to love all the rapping
And now its like it just aint gone happen
People laughing loosing my passion
So I think how long am I lasting
Should I follow the fashion 
Change all my accent just start acting
Scottish voice too hard to imagine
You should know it will never bring cash in

In the spot and I pop like a pimple
Hardest thing to do in rap is sound simple
Its too easy to make it sound sinful
I think you dropped the ball like it was pinball
And I cant cant play no more
And I'm no no getting the high score
But I still get high for a score
Twenty quid on a bag and I lie on the floor
Puff lie get high and get high some more
Its all I really do mate dont you see I'm a bore
Lifes a shore a beach I wont more
Trying to sell CDs when I used to chore
Its ironic but I still fucking do it
Dont like rap these days but still play it
Its just what I think mate I just say it
Rap turned its back on us now just face it
Thats when I get that feeling
That I should start stealing
Cause the shit that a got aint the shit that want
So what is the point like

I used to love all the rapping
And now its like it just aint gone happen
People laughing loosing my passion
So I think how long am I lasting
Should I follow the fashion 
Change all my accent just start acting
Scottish voice too hard to imagine
You should know it will never bring cash in
I used to love all the rapping
And now its like it just aint gone happen
People laughing loosing my passion
So I think how long am I lasting

Should I follow the fashion
And just start acting
Its too hard too imagine
And I will never bring cash in
So why am I rapping
why
I cant answer that last bit 
Sorry

I used to love all the rapping
And now its like it just aint gone happen
People laughing loosing my passion
So I think how long am I lasting

But I'm not giving up
Iv came to far to just give up my work
And all thats iv done and all that iv wrote
Is far to much to now call it a joke cunt

But I still love rapping
And theres a chance that it might just happen
If your laughing at my passion
Then I think that we are going to start scrapping
So I wish like Aladdin
I wish I wish and I'm asking
Not how long I am lasting 
But how long till I bring that cash in</pre>
