[Verse 1]
Hello! This is my tattered fedora flow
What's the matter? You mad at your horoscope?
Nigga switch your sign and quit your whinin'
Matter fact, switch your whole flagrant persona
Fubu is for boobs, switch to Dolce &amp; Gabbana
Three cheers for perseverance
Plan B for my career? Have a Verse-Of-The-year clearance
Tight shit, write shit well and get tracks bought
Strike rich, type hits, sell 'em to Black Thought
And make a killin', a million or more
Stealing your ceilings and floors
Chillin' with Amil and Sommore, uh
They like to roleplay and dress as nude cops
Gotta go, Coolio, mean it's gettin' +Too Hot+
If Fay' had twins, she'd probably have two 'Pac's
I gay-bash men who like to grab dude's cocks
Nah, I'm only kidding, just me ol' me
An Equal Opportunity Bigot: E.O.B.

[Verse 2]
Peace to Section 8, keep the riff-raff pissed
Peace to Megan Bates with them big ass tits
That keep me warm at night, you're more than tight
You're the amplifier jack in my cordless mic, I'm crass
Splish splash, I was taking a bath
Made it a habit to snap emcees and break 'em in half
Don't know what happened to the patience I had
You just a faker and a snake in the grass
Real talk homie
If I'm a liar than Pinocchio isn't
You mad this album's full of fire and colloquialisms
Rented out the chapel for my bachelor party
And sent the choir to a Tokyo prison
I'm so cruel</pre>
