[Chorus: Soulja Slim]
Slow motion for me, slow motion for me, move it slow motion for me
Slow motion for me, slow motion for me, move it slow motion for me
Uh I like it like that she working that back I don't know how to act
Slow motion for me, slow motion for me, slow motion for me
Move it slow motion for me
Uh I like it like that she working that back I don't know how to act
Slow motion for me, slow motion for me, slow motion for me
Move it slow motion for me

[Verse 1: Soulja Slim]
I'm a dick thrower
Her neck and her back hurting
Cut throater I'll have you like a brand new virgin
I'ts like when you get used of it then you start serving
Hop up on top and start jicky-jicky-jicky jerking
Slow down for me you moving too fast
My fingers keep slipping I'm trying to grip that ass
Keep being hard headed and Ima make you get of me
Got human enough disguise  but my face is a doggy
If you loving my bark let me bury my bone
I got 4 or 5 bad married bitches at home
One of my bitches feel in love with that outside dick
that outside dick keep them hoes sick

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Juvenile]
I'ts like I got the world in my palms
Your girl up under my arms
She fucked up from the charm
She love the way the dick stay hard from 12 till early in the morn
Fine bitches if you listening you heard me I'm strong
If you going through your cycle I ain't with It I'm gone
You must have heard about them hoes that I beat up in my home
They wasn't telling the truth baby you know they was wrong
Na make it official wheres some of that don
I don't mind buying to, your riding to
Don't be asking nigga questions about where I'm driving you
Lil mama my shit together I ain't driving you
I don't think that nigga could do you better then I could do ya know
And juvenile from cross the street by the derby
Same nigga that used to be running with rusty and kirby
Can a playa from the 'nolia get a chance with it
But I can't bounce with you without using my hands with it

[Chorus: Soulja Slim]
Uh I like it like that she working that back I don't know how to act
Slow motion for me, slow motion for me, slow motion for me
move it slow motion for me
Uh I like it like that she working that back I don't know how to act
Slow motion for me, slow motion for me, slow motion for me
move it slow motion for me

[Verse 3: Soulja Slim]
Slow motion, she open, I'm hoping that she don't leave my dick broken
With brush burns and swollen
I'm toting she wanted me to make her out a believer
I gurantee ya ima see ya when I see ya
And just don't holla out my name like we was all that
Your pussy throw back and you know that
So stop stunting slow motion for a real nigga
I'm going off that incredible potion and imma deal with ya

[Juvenile]
I like how that victoria secret sit in that ass
Let me pour some more hip and hennsey in your glass
Would I be violating if I grab me a handfull
I know what's happening all I want is a sample
Who you wit I'm in the rental today
It's going down and happening and I remember the way
Less money we spend on bullshit the more for the we
What's it gonna take for you to come slow motion with me

[Chorus 3X: Soulja Slim]
Uh I like it like that she working that back I don't know how to act
Slow motion for me, slow motion for me, slow motion for me
move it slow motion for me
Uh I like it like that she working that back I don't know how to act
Slow motion for me, slow motion for me, slow motion for me
move it slow motion for me</pre>
