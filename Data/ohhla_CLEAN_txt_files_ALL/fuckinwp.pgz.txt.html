[Verse 1]
Dudes on the net like vicious animals
Suck more bones than fifty cannibals
Wash your mouth out with flammable fuel
I kick jewels like solar power, no mechanical bulls
This is it, you fools must have amnesia
My delivery's sicker than scripts on Fat Pizza
Who's the man? Reaching the un-obedient
Undefeated, flow is free as a drunk comedian
My styles like pleading for the judge's lenience
Wearing a shirt that says I love graffiti
Nothing to hide, I got a filthy mind
Bitches call me Jackhammer Milky Eye
Ladies call me the gentleman, girls call me the veteran
Underground kings on the mic call me pre-eminent
Keep repping generic and cheap brethren
You'll never be a skilled and stunning unique specimen

[Hook]
"Bring fire"
You ain't fuckin' wid Pegz
"Bring the pain"
Fuckin' wid Pegz
"Harm the ignorant"
Fuckin' wid Pegz...
"Fuck with me, fuck with me, fuck with me, please"
"You wanna diss like you got a trick up your sleeve?"
"Fuck with me, fuck with me, fuck with me, please"

[Verse 2]
Call me Pegz, I get higher than Sam Human
And love vagina like Rasputin
Sorry I didn't mean that, the devil made me do it
Got a slight case of Tourette's, like Lleyton Hewitt
Cause I came from the sewer now I'm making manoeuvres
We got T-bone steaks and case of ?Calluer?
Don't be mistaken by my great sense of humour
I'll break into your house and take the computer
I'll black mail your crew to sail to Bermuda
I'm a grown killer while you're a stale tin of tuna
North to West, nobody's fuckin' wid Pegz
I got respect for the scene and love for the heads
Cause I pressed my first record using the rent
And opened doors for nearly every crew that I met
So any dudes on the net wanna battle Pegz?
"You might as well run into the wall and bang ya head"
