[Chorus]
Now I'm popped up twice, drink on ice
High beams on, forever top flight
Mile high flow, cabin pressure low
Watching out for traffic control
I'm clear for landing, landing, landing
I'm clear for landing, landing, landing
I'm clear for landing, landing, landing
Shit, I'm too fly to be touched, too hard to be crushed

[Big K.R.I.T.]
Jamming, when I pull out on the scene
Hoes, hop up out they jeans
Jaws, drop up on the scene
when that plane be super clean like something out of a dream, or a movie
Groovy broads jesting that they choosing
I feel 'em all the same
Down to do whatever before I ask 'em they name
They just wanna know, Krizzle, can you sing?
I say, yes I can (yes I can)
Even with highs and lows (highs and lows)
Pull up in that old ride (old school)
Do it like a player 'posed (player, player, player play on)
Back to what I was talking bout
Don't miss out on this pimping cause ain't no stalling out
I get ya where ya wanna, that's if ya calling out
to me from the stands
I'll holler at ya when we land

[Chorus]

[Big K.R.I.T.]
This that "Skew It on the Bar-B", where's the party?
Summer time and, feeling fine and, drinking forties
with my kinfolk, playing spades and, still debating
bout going to the club after, shit's overrated
I'm kinda faded, my shawty jaded
cause I don't pick up when she call, it's complicated
Holler later, roller-skating, super bassing
Turn it up to the max like, goodness gracious
It's back breaking, my neighbors hate me, keep it shaking
808 earthquaking, life changing
The way it knock on the pavement, hear me in Asia
They way it thump in the trunk, you'll think I'm in danger
Becoming one with the sun like a space invader
Another shot just before it, I don't need a chaser
Reggie Miller ain't allowed, we don't like the Pacers
when you in my plane hanger

[Chorus]

[Big K.R.I.T.]
If you drinking and you po' something, po' something, po' something
One time, one time for y'all
If ya smoking and you roll something, roll something, roll something
One time, one time for y'all
To all my family, let me hold something, hold something, hold something
One time, one time for y'all
An all them broads that down to show something, show something, show something
One time, one time for y'all

[Chorus]</pre>
