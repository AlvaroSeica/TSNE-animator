My third leg is what I think with
A blunt is what I drink with
On the solo tip loungin in my polo fit
Hold that ???? line two
That's cool I'll get it
It's just another honey I'm sure I will hit it
I picked up the phone she said "bam what's up?"
But all I was hearin was "bam lets oooaaahhhmmm"
Put my ear to the phone and she's moanin and groanin
6121 the address to my home and
Honey's commin over, She came from long range in a rover
I poured two glasses no longer are we sober
October, my birthday when's yours?
She said it was in May and by the way I'm a Taurus
Pour us two more glass of Aleza, and pass the blunt my way honey
Yeah, pass the blunt my way honey
Pass the blunt my way
Pass the blunt my way honey
Cause its much more chill when we hit the hay honey hay

We was on the phone and everything was poppin
Now I keep going and you keep stoppin
"If we was playing bones that's they only way you're knocking my name"
Hey I can make the ass drop

Don't Stimulate if I can't penetrate baby don't stimulate
I can make that ass drop
Don't Stimulate if I can't penetrate baby don't stimulate
I can make that ass drop

Don't make me beg, cause I'm not a beggar
She called me half-pint so I pulled the one leg out
Hold it, felt it
Her skirt kitty cat looked fat I'm about to go to work
But I felt like a jerk, when I saw the tampax
Cause on the tube it'd be crude like anthrax
So I pulled out my stash, Buddha's kinda stinky
She was still feelin kinky, suckin on my pinky
Oh Jinky, leaned back she put her head on my lap
I hope she grabs the microphone and busts a rap
Cause there's no job, like a blowjob
She replied I'm not your average ho john

Honey, don't stimulate if I can't penetrate
Get me all aroused and then make me wait
Three in the morning nothing's open but lips
So if I can't have them hips, then give me them tricks

Don't stimulate if I can't penetrate
Get me all aroused and then make me wait
Cause that makes me mad real quick
But I'm the mellow, so I'm off some old shit
You call me on the phone
Talking to me nasty tell me how you need a bone
Well just call me the big bone giver
Special deliverer, did you hear me tell ya

We're hearin ya straight and never steerin ya wrong
I love to hit the skins after hits from the bong
Ding Dong, the doorbell rings
Her monkeys lookin fat in her big star jeans
I told her come in my friend on a scale of one to ten
She's ten to the third and word she smoked herb
We was Thai'd, but not like how I wanted too
Rubbin on the booty couldn't hit it, "Yo honey fronted you"
Bumpin and grindin, I tried to get behind and
Almost got it in, then honey started whinin
And dissin, at first we was grindin and kissin
I'm straight its getting kinda late
I can make that ass drop

Honey don't stimulate if I can't penetrate
Honey don't stimulate ("I can make that ass drop")
Honey don't stimulate if I can't penetrate
Honey don't stimulate ("I can make that ass drop")</pre>
