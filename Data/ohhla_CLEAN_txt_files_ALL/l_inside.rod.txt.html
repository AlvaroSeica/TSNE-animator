Album:  Rodentity
Song:   Laugh Inside
Typed by: Cno Evil

[Chorus: Valerie]
All the tears you cry
You wonder how come you can't dry your eyes
And then you realize, that it's raindrops
You'll just laugh inside

[Cno Evil]
I used to do it for a hobby, now I do it for a living
I'll leave your socks bloody like your name was Curt Schilling
I'm going for the homer, I'm not talking bout the Simpson
You going for the quarters, while I'm going for the millions
Who winning? Johnny, got Li-Mouse behind me
Finally, right? You might say that I'm grimy
Two I's in my last name, two eyes on my face
Rhyming in the fast lane, the lyrical race
Aiyo, check it, I don't carry no baggage
Call me Wilson, I stay producing 'rackets'
Those who love you, they probably hate me
And this might bug you, but it don't phase me
Remember the fun, the times, and those phat rhymes?
But I was the one, who picked up on the signs
Angels smiling, the devils be lying
The tempers be flying, cuz I be conniving
The Rode is blocked, now, kid, take another path
Mark my words, this ain't being mad or being sad
This is being glad of having what I never had
The real life version of the yin and the yang
Battling, like the chess pieces on the board
Oh lord, what the fuck you know about a sword?
Don't do it to yourself, put that back on the shelf
Don't fuck with the sharpness, cuz it's bad for your health
I got the knowledge like Knickolist, watch how I'm living this
Pancake rhymes, so watch how I'm flipping this
Lyricist, lyrical worker, the supporter
Destroy shit like John Rambo up in Burma
The daunting, fountain of youth, the mountain of truth
That I must climb, so I rhyme in the booth
Like I'm running out of time, I'm running out of lines
I think Cno Evil, cuz I've become blind

[Li-Mouse]
Like injured athletes, I ain't playing, not sugar coated
Li-Mouse, in case you forgot, keep that noted
Born with supremacy, you can ask Damon
Your flow is poor, just look when I'm raining
If I can't get shit, I'm Magnum P.I. Robin 1
You got caliber, son, but no chance of dodging them
I'm serious, kid, you can ask Slim Shady
If not, you get choked out like some breached baby
Watch like you was Casio or Movado
I become wanted like the winning numbers of the lotto
Bitch ass cats, your brain remains hollow
Zombie cat, like a trailer, you always follow
Leading is no option, I've been here first
Fuck, shit, bitch, hell, yeah, you've been cursed
Out, like a baseball player in the MLB
You ain't bust a nut when you fucking with me
You know Li, got that shit, that's crazy
Catch me on Mam Ave., chilling in Lazy
If I see your punk ass, I might say 'peace'
Otherwise, you get knocked the fuck out, I don't cease
Yeah, that's word, straight up
Wack MC's stay spitting shit that's made up
Lines of rhymes, they stay fabricated
I ain't Hillary, I don't need to be debated
Whether or not my style is weak or just plain great
Growing up, everyone used to tell me...

[Outro: Li-Mouse (Cno Evil)]
Oh, shit, I forgot about that part
I made up that whole fucking part ---
I made the whole shit up, I don't say any of that (What?)
Yo, look, hold on, let me listen again (what's wrong with you?)
I made it up, dog</pre>
