I'm thirty-one this ain't no case of babies raising babies
But malaise's haze has claimed me, this be lazy raising babies, ehh
And if I let my duties slip I'll raise a lame ass baby, wait
They say that it's my job to raise it, maybe if they paid meÂ…
And who the fuck is they, they say to much they cake holes flailing, gaping
Flapping when it ain't gone help, it just irritate me greatly, man
to educate 'em's draining, cable TV's able maybe
Aids me though depravity on TV's fatal/baneful to their raising
Check eighteen years later and you've made a crazy Casey
Casey A that's Anthony, the dame's insane and making babies
An enabled baby-suffocating raver, not a lady, say
Or maybe it's a male and it's a latent rapist baby, dang
You aimed to raise a baby that'd make gains attaining great things
While they're breaking down and failing, wifey's gazing at me angry
hates me says I'm tasteless, pain you gave me's inhumane see
how you've wasted plain potential drained it flame is suffocated
lame, you made insane, I'm saying obtained-a-case-of-rabies crazed
depraved enraged thing laziness has failed em can't nobody save em</pre>
