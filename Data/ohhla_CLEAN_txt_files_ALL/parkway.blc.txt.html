and they runnin, hit the deck, get the check, from gangsta blac
B-B-N we got your back, yellin please don't act like that, WATCH OUT
As i walk to the valley of the shadows of Parkway
them point, no play, i can say them  keep them hangin
smoke nor fiend,  then tell them bust or go play play

Now in Memphis, Tenn. where them boys should be killed
Riding twenty inches and they wavin' them thang thangs
S-O-U-T-H Parkway, them no play play

Get your shit straight test us and we test you shit

Get your shit straight test us and we test you shit

them same ones who blockin all so i wouldn't make it by
and i ain't mad, but i would rather see them sufferin boy
them gamez they play, one day they shall chill with the lord
but on the realla, gangsta blac gone keep it all in the fam
cuz they got love,  in the first and plus they know who i am
reloadin combat, take aim then you  bust out

cuz buddha got me bumped out, on this i'm claimin all plow
so shoot it out yo damn mouth, i must respect the down south
