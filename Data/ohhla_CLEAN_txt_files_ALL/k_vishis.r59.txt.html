[Kid Vishis]
It's Fry Boys Radio
You're now fryin up in the skillet
where anybody can motherfuckin get it
If you cain't take the heat
get yo' bitch ass out the kitchen
I'm so sick of this ol' dog butt shit
and that means bitch-ass for you niggaz that don't get it
We the ones
with all the guns
AR's, rocket launchers
Shit we done did it all nigga
Don't fuck with nuts {*4X*}
{*laughing*}
It don't help that this nigga Royce right here laughin
{*vocal scratch*} And you ain't never got to guard me
Nah now you gotta do it~!
Ricky baby! You ain't never got to guard me Ricky baby!
Mmmmmmmm-mmm-mmmmmm
Mmmmm-hmmmmmmm
Humm on my nuts
Hmmmmm
When Jes-uhhh-us, blew up the room
Blew up a room
That's right I'ma bring it from the soul nigga
Blew up a room
Blew up a room
At yo' funeral I'ma just bust right up in the motherfucker
like blew up a room
I'ma bust right in the motherfucker
like blew up a room
C'mon man I'm out of here dog
Y'all fucked people
