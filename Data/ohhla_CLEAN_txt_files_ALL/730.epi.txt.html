[Hex-One]
Yeah...
Aiiyo I walk the streets with no fear
My speech prohibit these emcees to flow here
I reach inside and ride train of thought that leads to nowhere
My rain check, spitting dousing flames to get your brain wet
Insane vet, my vocals hit you harder than a train wreck
I rock the alphabet from omega to alpha-beta
Attacking haters and snapping on cats like alligators
We holding it down while you attract invaders
I transfer raps and paper to tracks and wax faster than fax and data
The Hex'll hold it down for ransom with the frag grenaders
I get to bombing like Iraqi nature, I'm major
Eradicate you cats and splash you fags with acid vapor
My soul control of the the mic is tighter than wrapping paper
You never heard me, I'll wreck your set and exit early
Blur you like a shaken Etch-A-Sketch making perception murky
And wet your clergy, I prefer to keep my weapons dirty
Come and test this vet if you expect your mental methods worthy
I spit with arrogance, wicked passages
Making fire burn inside you till your ribs get callouses
In fact my data shatters balance with descriptive narratives
The pictures I paint are ancient like Egyptian phalluses
Yo I quote the illest till a million twisting philly rollers hear us
All my O.E. forty spillers know the dealings
From the coldest willies to them silly phony baking soda dealers
I'mma flow the realest till killers in South Dakota feel us
Why you liars like to say that you tight
Knowing that being weeded be the only way that you write
See I can burn you cats to any shade of grey you like
And if you think my shit is crazy you right

[Hook]
Cause yo my shit is seven-thirty
You never heard me cause your head ain't worthy
Front on my set and get to Heaven early
Yo we keep rocking on, yeah we keep rocking on, what
Yeah we keep rocking on, word we keep rocking on

Hey yo my shit is seven-thirty
You never heard me cause your head ain't worthy
Front on my set and get to Heaven early
Yo we keep rocking on, yeah we keep rocking on, what
Yeah we keep rocking on, word we keep rocking on

[Teknition]
Every verse I'm speaking can reach the masses
Wreaking havoc over these beats with lashes
Slashing fleets and gashes leaving captains retreating backwards
Read the captions I'm seven-thirty with no re-enactment
I'm breezing past them like Testaverde completing passes
My fahrenheit defeating your characteristics
I'm cannabalistic, you dare to bite, I'm leaving your teeth in fractures
My shit's disgusting I'm squeezing tactics that filled with substance
That brings disasters with wicked functions that be eating rappers
So kill the subject, you don't need it faggot
Before I proceed with action machines and gatlings leaving you leaking gallons
Of blood, I gallop with thugs and elite assassins that can snipe a spot
From 90 blocks without the needs of practice, I storm with thoughts once the chorus stops
I stand as tall as forest tops cause I'm enormous with performing arts
So fill me on your slot, on your drop, warned you not to take it there
Now I'mma blaze your ears with these foreign shots
On or off the block my racket is full, every verse I pack'll fracture your skull
Satisfied, you had to drive but at the time you lacking the fuel
That's when you catch the impact from the bull
Antagonizing these whack niggas, my minions'll send them to Heaven for me (fucker)
Thinking they pose a threat, not for a second I'll ever worry
I'll wreck your set and exit early, then I'll turn myself in, go to court and tell the jury
