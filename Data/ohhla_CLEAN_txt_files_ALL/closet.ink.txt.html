Song:   Closet Freak
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Yeah, girl we can chill
Get you to the crib
Show you how I live
Put on your favourite song
Lay you on the bed
Do a couple things
I know that you ain't doing with your man

Got her doing things she ain't doing with her man [x4]
She a closet freak
Closet freak
Closet freak
And imma bring her out
She a closet freak
Closet freak
Closet freak
And imma bring her out tonight

Said imma bring her out, bail bonds
Beat it up, like some alpines
Just take another shot, foul line
Energy like I'm runnin on some alkalines
Posin shins like pilates
Tase her too, she can feel it in her body
It's gettin hot in here, just catch a tan
Cos girl I got a plan
I know that you ain't doing with your man

Got her doing things she ain't doing with her man [x4]
She a closet freak
Closet freak
Closet freak
And imma bring her out
She a closet freak
Closet freak
Closet freak
And imma bring her out tonight

Cos baby he can't do it like I do
I know how to bring out a IQ
Good brain in the fast lane
So we don't play games like
We from the ceilin to the floor
Got three things that you never did before
Eyes roll back
Put her in a trance
See girl I got a plan
I know that you ain't doing with your man

Got her doing things she ain't doing with her man [x4]
She a closet freak
Closet freak
Closet freak
And imma bring her out
She a closet freak
Closet freak
Closet freak
And imma bring her out tonight

Good girl gone bad know you heard of her
We wake the neighbours up, disturbia
Got the lights off, no sheets
Headboard kno-knocking like the police
Cartwheels and handstands
Shit you never did with your last man
Don't got to say it again
But girl I got a plan
I know that you ain't doing with your man

Got her doing things she ain't doing with her man [x4]
She a closet freak
Closet freak
Closet freak
And imma bring her out
She a closet freak
Closet freak
Closet freak
And imma bring her out tonight</pre>
