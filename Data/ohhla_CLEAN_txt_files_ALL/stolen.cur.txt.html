Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus x2]
Bought it this morning, drive it like I stole it
Park it left it running like I really don't want it
We've been bending corners
Been like, bent like elbows, been being anywhere that cash go

[Verse]
Checking my mirror for them suckers
Coast clear, turn up that music, light another
This that mink coat flow, I wrote this in the summer
Poolside, high-school, you motherfucker
To the rules we abide by on this side
Members only like the jacket, I grew up amongst some criminals
Check their jackets, known for etching with them ratchets
While I was just cooling, writing raps, eating snacks and shit
300 racks I spent just to sit in back and get higher than a mother
Looking down to them scrubs
How could you hate yo brother when I'm just like you?
Except I did what I said and I would, do erase the hate
And let the sunshine through
Apply yourself fool, you can live out yo dreams too
Imagination can create the truth
Every brick that built my mansion will provide the proof
Recognize he riding Bentley's when he coming fool
Like a set of Forgiatos on the living room
Luxury shit, fuck with me bitch
Capital G, the weather nice out, I'm hitting the switch
I'm in the streets, 13 inch, triple gold D's
Strike a pose, a picture worth 1000 words I suppose
Picture me rolling with yo golden and chosen who you thought would hold it
Down for ya but she clowned ya
You're under pressure, so unprofessional
High beyond measure, sharing her treasure with my fellows
Oh she down for the jets bro, no tricking no financial
Strictly finesse bruh, onto to the next bruh
Find her where I left her

[Chorus x2]
Bought it this morning, drive it like I stole it
Park it, left it running like I really don't want it
We've been bending corners
Been like, bent like elbows, been being anywhere that cash go

[The Godfather 1]
[Sollozzo] I need a man who has powerful friends
I need a million dollars in cash
I need, Don Corleone, all of those politicians
that you carry around in your pocket, like so many nickels and dimes
[Don Corleone] I said that I would see you because I had heard
that you were a serious man, to be treated with respect
But I must say no to you and let me give you my reasons</pre>
