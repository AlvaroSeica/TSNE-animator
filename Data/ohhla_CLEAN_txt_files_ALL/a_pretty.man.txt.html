Song:   A Pretty Marvelous Story
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Intro]
This record you are going to hear
is a pretty marvelous story, a sort of miracle
And there couldn't be anybody better to tell you
{*scratched: "MANTRA"*}
That's right! Follow the old maestro
{*scratched: "power to spoken"*}
That's the miracle I was telling you about
{*scratched: "equals with a template, dealing with the next phase"*}
This is all a part
(That is important, and a wonderful story)

[Mantra]
There must be a method to his madness
to have such a power effect upon the masses

[Outro]
Well years ago they thought it could make you insane
Medical science has shown this isn't true at all
{*"What is it in the composition, that make us wanna listen?"*}
It's a chemical substance
The bloodstream carries it through the body and that changes you
Well that's nothing to worry about either
But you'll begin to feel differently about quite a lot of things
(Well that's the start)
(But you haven't told the most wonderful part)
(We do this because we love you)</pre>
