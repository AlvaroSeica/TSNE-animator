Song:   Does it Really Matter? (iTunes Bonus Track)
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

yea uhhh....its k'naan....
yeaa uuhh about to take over with this here we go I check it...

They don't expect me on this beat the thunder on the street
but I never turn the cheek surrender or retreat
you can bet that I am strong
trying to right what is wrong they say it wont be long
keep on singing your song but hey yo you need a single
single to make a mingle
something that's kinda simple I would hate to call it jingle
a single is a missile takes you right to the middle
of 106 and park and maybe Jimmy Kimmel
you will need somebody famous co-singin it for your anus
who you got on your album I don't see where the name is
but I do it my own way I do it my own way I do...
if you do what you do your own way you could be famous too

[Chorus]
if the beat is hot does it matter where or who its from
if the flow is hot does it really matter where I am from
if the song is hot does it matter cuz the dj drum
if the girl is hot does it really matter where she is from
if the beat is hot does it matter where or who its from
if the flow is hot does it really matter where am from
if the club is hot does it really matter how we drum
if the girl is hot does it really matter where she is from

I could've been from the west side or the Chi-Town like Twista
with a flow so sick it blow you to bits
it will show you the glitz and gold in the wrist
and the boat in the fish and I blow them a kiss
let's blow give them em a sweet talking in a piss
while taking a piss are you talking to the fish
or the girls in the boat exposing their tits
I could've been from NY like Rakim with the my pen
I can get "Paid in Full" with praise and tools
erased and rules my case of jewels
am cold like glazier glew with blades and fools am raging bulls
I could've been from L.A. like Dre and Snoop
rolling in my six four with fresh case jewels
and am ridding on em niggaz unless they cool
and I got border troubles like them eses fool
I could've been I could've been from the dirty like A Town
and M.I.A I could ride an invisible motor cycle and go HEY [echo]
hey hey...storm like the Hurricane
and I don't mean "Ay Bay Bay"
am from african where they say K'Naan umayey

[Repeat Chorus]

if you wana make it hot then you better do a drop
(echoes drop drop drop drop drop drop...)
if you wana get a hit you better add to the street
(echoes street ooh yea...)
and he is tougher than you suckers
none of you could ever bark at him look at him
make you tough guys look like you are from suckatem
I do it my own my own my I do it my own way I do...
if you do what you do your own way you could be famous too

[Repeat Chorus x2]</pre>
