(I'm the abyss, ready to determine your lifeline)

Sometime I can't remember, sometime I can't forget
My mind is always changing, who cares, who gives a shit

I had a dream, one drunk, one fiend
Just two left on the hip-hop scene
Treach was my slave in my deep dark cave
Lyte was blind, just a sign of her grave
Callin, I've fallen on my knees, mama please
God saved the world, we are free from disease
Shaq got to get it, I was with it, I'm a star
Kane lost the fame, what a shame, he went far
Ahead, brain dead, Brand Nubian schooled me and
Busta Rhymes bought time and put me in videos
Shows, massive photos
No more AIDS, no freaks, no skank hoes
But hum-diddy-dum, yikka-yo-boom-bip
The Queen sold out on a hoochie tip
Got hard, Lord Jamar turned bald
And called pale men true god

I don't wanna walk around
Can't stand the noisy sound
Music's way too loud
And my, my, my, my
My feet are my only carriage
My feet are my only carriage

But I can't sing no more, soars get sore
I'm the cool kid on the Sade tour
Onyx just got hoarse, Boss got lost
Lost in the course of Rage
Rage on the super mack shit
Snoop on the super wack shit
It must be a dream cause it seems so fake
People so real, can't fall for the okey-doke
In the way of my thoughts
Rap scene picked by the pseudo sports

I don't wanna walk around
Rhymin's way too wild
Music's way too loud
My, my, my, my
My feet are my only carriage
My feet are my only carriage

But sometime I can't remember, sometime I can't forget
My mind is always changing, who cares, who gives a shit
Sometime I can't remember, sometime I can't forget
My mind is always changing, who cares, who gives a shit

(I'm the abyss, ready to determine your lifeline)

BDP got a new marchin band
And Wu-Tang wrote a book about me
But I can't read nor touch
Damn, what I'm gon' do, Redman?
PRT done tricked the land
I got Sadat on the beats that bump
EPMD, what a way to thump
And come back
Jeru's Bobby Womack
Too $hort's Cube, I mean that

But sometime I can't remember, sometime I can't forget
My mind is always changing, who cares, who gives a shit
Sometime I can't remember, sometime I can't forget
My mind is always changing, who cares, who gives a shit

Who gives a shit
Who gives a shit
Who gives a shit
