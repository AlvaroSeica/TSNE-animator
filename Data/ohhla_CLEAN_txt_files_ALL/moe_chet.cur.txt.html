[Verse 1]
Yeah, rub my back while I rap bitch
Jet Life, joints look like bats
You know what that is, homicide, kamikaze high, not giving a shit
Never die, this'll go on for years
Multiply, legacy of the fly
Pedigree champion blood line, the big dog got the big yard
Behind a big crib, big garage, a fleet of ten cars
Shake the devil off, angel on the hood
In that, looking good in that
Roger would've had if you was just good and rapped
Look at that, after all she did he done took her back
That's real love, exactly how I feel about them stacks
Addicted to that money, it took me under like crack
I chase it like it's running from me all over the map
I'll go to it's at, if you my bro we can split it in half

[Chorus]
Moe' betta', moe' chettah'
I smoke betta', then those fella's
Ho you should know betta'
Don't test us, we professional
No audio dope sellers
Don't tell 'em, they'll get so jealous
Moe betta', moe' chettah'

[Verse 2]
Sitting in the Porsche parked outside of the port
Overseeing the airport process, let my bitches sort it out at the fort
Back at the set, they get wet from the sound of my engine
My design in women
Two in the kitchen, the other two in the pool nude
But far too fine for me to say they skinny dipping
I never been in a position where I didn't come out winning
Even if I was losing in the beginning
Stuck with it, now I'm up shifting
That three twenty-eight, game crooked but the paper straight
Got them bitches looking, yup

[Chorus]</pre>
