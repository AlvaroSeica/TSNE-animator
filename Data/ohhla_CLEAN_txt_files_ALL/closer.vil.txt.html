[Dwele]
There's somethin' I wanted to know
Can we get closer
Yeah baby
Seems like I've waited so long
Can we get closer

[Elzhi]
Girl you should come up for the week
I'll make you cum from the tub to the sink
Rubbin' your feet in the luxury suite
Make sure you come with nothin' on just a long shearling
And I'll make your toes curl up like they all (?)
I whisper in your ear, tell you somethin'
Stick my tongue in your belly button
Reach down below you know I'm well sprung
Hit you from the back
Get your calves trembling
And pull your hair till it's straight, you look half Indian
Laugh and giggling when champagne bubbles tickle your nose
Before you, I wouldn't throw my old nickels at hoes
I'm just glad we can get close
For breakfast in the morning
we can fly out to Paris, France for the French toast
You made me wait so long and that's a good thing
Now let me make the candy rain dampen your thong
I'll hit it off like a champion strong, for real
You still bumpin' and grindin' even after the song but all along II

[Refrain]

[T3]
Let me talk to ya, feel me for a sec
I love your sassy ways, I must confess
You lookin' good, girl I hope you in to sex
Sorta like a model type with a splash of innocence
Your fast charms, ass like your moms
I love that Tiffany charm that's hangin' from your arm
And if we get it on, I'ma take her back to the fort
Show her how I run game like an athlete in sport
Sweetie, I can see that money ain't a thing
Been doin' this for a while, no need to explain it
You're doin' swell girl, you never doin' poorly
You know I'm hoppin' in whips just look at the jewelry
Plus you need a man in your life
Yo someone who can hit it right and plus got the right dough
Plus I'll treat you like a queen, girl
Your place or mine I was thinkin' we should get close

[Chorus]

[Dwele]
A lot of cats done tried it
I like to touch the na na, I
Know you act real shy but, (know you get down)
You're not that type we go
Just keep it low and let it go
No need to act up cause I, (know you get down)
Can we get closer tonight
I'll make it right
Touch you inside baby, I (make you get down)
Hold you very close, with or without clothes
Public or closed doors
We will get closer</pre>
