Song:   White Kids Aren't Hyphy
Typed by: @mc_lars (Horris Records)

Chorus:
I wish I was a little bit hyphy, I wish E-40 liked me
I wish I didn't crash going ghost riding nightly
Wish I didn't have to face the fact that I'm whack on the track
White kids aren't hyphy!

Got kicked out of Slim's like a week ago
For crumping in the front row at the Anticon show
And everyone I know says I'm taking my chances
Cruising through Oakland bumping Sage Francis
San Jose rappers say they don't want to hear
Angry emo raps by Eyedea and Atmosphere
The hippies out in Berkeley tell me I should stop
Ghost riding my Volvo wearing Birkenstocks
So I took my Dad's Lexus into town for a spin
Surprised him back at home with some 18-inch rims
Up at Live 105 jumping on Aaron's desk
"Stop playing Mickey Avalon! His concepts are a mess!"
Traxamillion did this beat, now he's calling on the phone
Drank too much Hyphy Juice, then I got a kidney stone
The Bay has come back with a brand new sound
But it's so hard to be retarded, guess I'll never be down

Chorus:
I wish I was a little bit hyphy, I wish E-40 liked me
I wish I didn't crash going ghost riding nightly
Wish I didn't have to face the fact that I'm whack on the track
White kids aren't hyphy!

I wish I was a little bit hyphy, not white like Kiera Knightly
I wish I had a whip for the girls rocking Nike
Wish I didn't have to face the fact when I'm back with the raps
White kids aren't hyphy!

Showed up at the side-show but they laughed at me
Tried to ghost ride my whip but I hit a tree
And I can't yoke my Volvo on five bucks a gallon
Didn't have any thizz so I popped a Valium, because
That's how we roll when we're in the Bay Area
The rippers ride the Yellow Bus we bring the mass hysteria
I'm up in the club in my brand new stunnas
Had a seizure form the strobes so my moves got dumber
Keak da Sneak looked at me and said, "Yo this kid can dance!"
I was keeping it so treal that I split my baggy pants
Then I got up on the mic all def/deaf dumb and hyphy
From Richmond to Vallejo rappers want to be just like me
E-40?s in his scraper with his brand new slumper
I'm chillin' with Bubb Rubb in the tricked out Hummer
The kids yell "Yee!" the whistles go "Whoo!"
Don't know what I just said on this verse, do you?

Chorus:
I wish I was a little bit hyphy, I wish these rappers liked me
Wish they weren't on Myspace always typing "Bite me!"
Wish I didn't have to face the fact that I lack the attack
White kids aren't hyphy!

I wish I was a little bit hyphy, not your average white g
Catch me in the Source with five mics? That's unlikely
Wish I didn't have to face the fact that I'm whack like Iraq
White kids aren't hyphy!

Check out this dance move, it's the new hyphy style
You just throw your arms and legs around like you just got electrocuted
It's the new hyphy style. Let's get it twisted!

Easy man! You just kicked my girlfriend in the face! She's bleeding everywhere!

Come on man

Dude, you come on!

I'm just keeping it treal!

Chorus:
I wish I was a little bit hyphy, I wish E-40 liked me
I wish I didn't crash going ghost riding nightly
Wish I didn't have to face the fact that I'm wack on the track
White kids aren't hyphy!

I wish I was a little bit hyphy, not white like Kiera Knightly
I wish I had a whip for the girls rocking Nike
Wish I didn't have to face the fact when I'm back with the raps
White kids aren't hyphy!

Shout outs to the whole Bay Area!
What we used to call Marine World
Dr. Comics and Mr. Games
Stanford University  charging too much for a liberal arts education
Silicon Valley, thanks for inventing the Internet
The Oakland A's  please don't move to Fremont
I'll be rocking that hat with even less allegiance
