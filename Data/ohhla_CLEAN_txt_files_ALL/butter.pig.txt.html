[Chorus: Pigeon John and April Hendrix]
Brand new truck, butter-soft seats
Brand new truck, butter-soft seats
Brand new truck, butter-soft seats
(Now my brother and my nephew got enough to eat)
(It's goin down) Brand new truck, butter-soft seats
(It's goin down) Brand new truck, butter-soft seats
(It's goin down) Brand new truck, butter-soft seats
(With my sister and my moms in a penthouse suite, it's goin down)

[Pigeon John]
God is good when you're at the (O!!)
Just drop the O-D then you're good to go
(What's on your wrist?) Only a Casio
with a calculated account that counts extra slow
(How you're doin, Pige'?) I'm doin okay
I'm smilin with no shirt, drinkin OJ
Used to be a drought, now I'm +Singing in the Rain+
I could see my pain blossom in the bouquet
See they were just seeds planted in the dark times of life
The plant roots so it won't get plucked in the light
Now it's on, I want my momma in a Navigator
She used to give me quarters for a pack of Now &amp; Laters
It was awesome, grew up not knowin we was broke
Buyin cigarettes for my mom with the note
on the ice cream truck, I remember those days
Dressin bummy with the busted fades
But now we got a

[Chorus: Pigeon John and April Hendrix]
Brand new truck, butter-soft seats (You bet we got a)
Brand new truck, butter-soft seats (That's right we got a)
Brand new truck, butter-soft seats
(Now my brother and my nephew got enough to eat) (My uncle's got a)
(It's goin down) Brand new truck, butter-soft seats
(It's goin down) Brand new truck, butter-soft seats
(It's goin down) Brand new truck, butter-soft seats
(With my sister and my moms in a penthouse suite, it's goin down)

[Pigeon John]
I'm not tryna ball in a Lambo
I'm tryna keep my little nephew in some clean clothes
Some brand new Jordans, crisp white tees
Floatin down the court like a feather in a breeze
With no boundaries, with no care in sight
Spillin champagne on the first class flight
Cause it's free, so you know it's goin down like an enemy
Jukin fools like Vince Young out in Tennessee
Read it by the rules, number one: I can do anything
Maybe have a daughter or a son, push 'em on a swing
Who, really knows, what can happen? 
Suppose, this song becomes a hit and takes over, the globe?
A Tahoe for my brother, condo for my sister
Navigator for my mother, diamonds for my wife and much, mo'
What you gonna do when you get home from the road?
I'ma kiss my girl right, when I get thru the do'
It's goin down

[Chorus: Pigeon John and April Hendrix]
Brand new truck, butter-soft seats (You bet we got a)
Brand new truck, butter-soft seats (That's right we got a)
Brand new truck, butter-soft seats
(Now my brother and my nephew got enough to eat) (My uncle's got a)
(It's goin down) Brand new truck, butter-soft seats
(It's goin down) Brand new truck, butter-soft seats
(It's goin down) Brand new truck, butter-soft seats
(With my sister and my moms in a penthouse suite, it's goin down)</pre>
