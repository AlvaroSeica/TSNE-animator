my pride and joy..
<devastatin ear...="" to="" your="">

okay listen up gentlemen
veterans vitamins specimen Letterman
tell a friend pedalin'
amphetamine medicine Medalin
hematology skeleton trojan velatin
reverend see no evil since Solomon
origin motherland
must I begin babbling?
amphibian oblivion
I'm livin' the life of ten men following a mannequin that leads you
straight into a brick wall you shall fall like Berlin
you believe in oppression lesson learnin' Zen
gatherin fondlin' oxygen
wonder if this never could truly never be comprehended
I bled so sick when down to a mic and a pen
listen

it's the greatest show on earth
nah, it's the greatest show ever heard
wanna surf my internet highway, complete with beats and words

on any occasion
my language invasion will toy with you at will
my spills flood country crops and small town villages
my image is seen through, moonstruck shadow, big screen, space station eight
`faceless voice placed in timeless verbal arenas
while you tiptoe ballerinas step past your past I pass
my everlasting, spell casting, mass occultation(?)
you need more livation(?)
so drink from my hands, while you sink down into the sand
one allows you to take stand and then
you collapse and you land lifeless
just mere flesh and bones
and some ideas that went unknown
no more fears, we can go home now
sincerely, Aceyalone
I know some brothers full of hate
some full of faith and some full of...
as I drift this animated digital state
my mental gets more sick
I have journeyed from the sperm to the germ
when no stone's unturned
from a haunting past
only wanting what will last is my concern

it's the greatest show on earth
nah, it's the greatest show on the planet
can it be that you just can't see what I see
granted

now maybe I should warn you
before I storm on you some more
disarm you, reform you
don't wanna harm you or alarm you
but nobody's leavin' here till they stop breathin' and choke
ever since I was a child teethin'
and able to speak I spoke heathen
under this tent's the greatest show ever seen ever heard
from the evergreen to the neverland ranch you never dreamed
but you slept and I witnessed it
it's over your head it's way outta your grasp now
you're outta weed outta cash outta gas and you're outta style
outta place and you're outta time and you're outta touch and you're outta line
and you're outta turn outta tune and you're outta wind
and you're one outta ten who must be outta their goddamn minds
I'm outta reach I'm outta you're element out of the ordinary outta sight
I'm a outsider
it's outta my hands I'm outta this world on the mic

and this is the greatest show on earth
it's the greatest show in the world
gotta pocket full of dirt and rocks
but I'm tryin' to give you this pearl

it's a concrete forest of course it is of course it is
the lamp posts are the oak trees the street tops are the streams
the natives stay inside their huts until that bright sun beams
then slowly they crept out to get some air
some argued some screamed some beamed some slept
some re-tatched some wept some hobbled some betrayed
some planted some begged some parted others laughed
some panicked some breathed some movement by the trees (gotcha)
somebody some magical logical something in the loom
some whom shall I say that
someone is watching every step you take
some doom is waiting for you in my shed
some thought some book some author's point of view
some bled some bland some music by the band
some danced some stood some drunk some plotted
some plant some growth some joint some exotic
some got it in the end and they bought the farm
some dared some apple some charm some scared
some hands around your neck
some place some trouble some scalpel
some fallin' from beginnin' to end
but never could understand
that greatest show on earth

it's the greatest show on earth
it's the greatest show in the world
gotta pocket full of dirt and rocks
but I'm tryin' to give you this pearl

it's the greatest show on earth
it's the greatest show on the planet
can it be that I just can see what you can't
granted

it's the greatest show on earth
it's the greatest show ever heard
wanna surf my internet highway
complete with beats and words

it's the greatest show on earth
it's way beyond belivin'
everybody end up coming
but nobody end up leavin'</devastatin></pre>
