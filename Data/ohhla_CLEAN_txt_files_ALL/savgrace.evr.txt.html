[Everlast]
One time around the block, two times around the clock
Three times, don't cross the little lady (lady)
So pretty and oh so bold, got a heart full of gold on a lonely road
She said, "I don't even think that God can save me" (save me)
(Am I) gainin ground (am I) losin face
(Have I) lost and found my saving grace
Thankful for the gift my angels gave me

[Everlast]
We're born alone we die alone, and I'm just sittin here by the phone
Waitin for the Lord to send my callin
Street wise from the boulevard, Jesus only knows that she tries too hard
She's only tryin to keep the sky from fallin
Any man who says it's heaven and Hell, probably got somethin useless to sell
You ask me if I'm saved, well what's it to ya?
Blow a quarter, cop another eight
You're runnin out of high, you're losin your faith
Throw your hands up and scream, "Hallelujah"
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah - amen

[Everlast]
One time around the sun, another year older and my work ain't done
It's time for me to write the final chapter (chapter)
Deal the cards and roll the dice, sex drugs &amp; rock'n'roll are my only vice
Tryin' to figure out just what's here after (here after)
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah - amen</pre>
