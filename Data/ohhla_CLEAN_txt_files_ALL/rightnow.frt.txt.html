[Mike Shinoda]
Someone right now is leaving their apartment
Looking down at the street, and wondering where their car went
Someone in the car sitting at a signal
In front of a restaurant, staring through the window
It's someone right now who's fingering their teeth
Who could use a little floss, right across the street
There's somebody on the curb who really needs a jacket
Spent half the rent, on a bar getting plastered
Now he's gotta walk, 14 blocks
Just to work at a shop where he's about to get fired
Someone right now is looking pretty tired
Staring at a labtop trying to get inspired
It's somebody, livin right across the street
Just wrote the best thing that she's written all week
But her best friend is coughin up blood in the sink
He can't even think what happened, feeling so confused
That he knows it looks bad, but there's nothing he can do
I wonder what's it like being right there in his shoes
But..

[Chorus] 1x (Mike Shinoda)
Yo, I'm just taking it in
Out the window of a hotel, better again
Tomorrow I will be gone
I don't know when I will be back
But in this world everything can change just like that
Like that, like that, like that that, like that, just like that

[Tak of Styles Of Beyond]
Somebody right now is droppin his vote
Inside a box, and trying not to get shot in his throath
For the act of freedom
Right now somebody stuck in Iraq, hoping that he gets shipped back breathing
In a war, but he's not really sure of the reason
So we show our support when the press mislead him
Though we mourn, remain proud to salute the troops
Get some, I know you boys got some work to do

[Ryu of Styles Of Beyond]
Meanwhile, right now someone's 25 to life
Or standing on the corner with their thumb up hitch hike
And scratching of a lotto ticket, hoping for the real winners
Sneaking through the border just to work and eat a real dinner
Right now, someone wishes they were you and I
Steady second guessing fatal thoughts of quiet suicide
But right now, staring at the window at a fiend
With holes in their arms, and holes in his jeans
He pulled out a cigarette, and sparked the lighting
Right around the corner, just out of my sight, but..

[Chorus] 2x (Mike Shinoda)
Yo, I'm just taking it in
From a second story hotel window again
TV's on, and my bags are packed
But in this world everything can change just like that
Like that, like that, like that that, like that, just like that

[Black Thought]
Right now, somebody is sitting in the darkness
Trying to figure out how to put some heat in their apartment
But they got a little mattress, a little carpet
And they appreciate it 'cause some people on a park bench
You see some rushing naked to the office
Wife fly by when she coming from the market
Right now somebody's coming out of pocket
Trying to dump that rock, they run around on the block with
Same time the cops is raising their glocks
With ink, to fill your legs and your back with som hot shit
Right now somebody is struggling to stop this mess
He's kickin and punching and cussing at the doctors
Down the hall, a child is takin it's first breath
The docters ain't even passed him to the nurse yet
Yeah, yo, I wonder if he understand what he's worth yet
Life, time spent, while we're on the earth yet
The answer to the question we all see
Can be found, it depends on how free ya'll we think
Right now, it's somebody who ain't eat all week
That would kill for the shit you throw away in the street
I guess one man's trash is the next man's treasure
One man's pain is the next man's pleasure
One say infinty, the next say forever
Right now everybody gotta get it together, man

[Chorus] (Mike Shinoda)
Uh, I'm just taking it in
In an another strange hotel lobby again
With my luggage and my bag, I don't know where I'm at
I'm in the world where it all changes just like that
Like that, like that, like that that, like that, just like that

Yeah, I'm just taking it in
Out the window of a hotel, better again
Tomorrow I will be gone
I don't know when I will be back
But in this world everything can change just like that
Like that, like that, like that that, like that, just like that</pre>
