[Werd]
What are you like you say that its shite
Like whenever I write they say aye right
But its my life and here is a mic
So to be honest mate I will do what I like
I used to invest in some bars of weed
But these days these bars are like all I need
Some pubs and the clubs give my heart for the diamonds
Until I get the spade and I'm buried in the silence
Underground but I aim for the clouds
I got my feet on the ground well at least for now
I need bread got the yeast the now
Im trying to heat it up a little or I'm trickling out
But every track every track is a stepping stone
I move past like fuck who I'm stepping on
I love the scene its all peace dont get me wrong
But sometimes I feel its all just a stepping stone
Maybe not maybe I was just getting stoned
Thinking about my life too much as I was getting on
Maybe I should call quits and just switch my tone
Maybe so but no cause this is home
And its my life and this is my mic
So hear me out mate this is what I'm like
Its just a thought or maybe not
Thinking my CD was something to cop
See I thought people would start buying
Thought they would come to the shows stop lying
Thought they would show respect for me trying
Maybe next day see a new son rising
Things dont happen like that
Couple years later I'm still sat at the back
Still have to live while having the fact
I always been a fucking loser I just happen to rap
But every track every track is a stepping stone
I move past like fuck who I'm stepping on
As I jump to the next I get better known
But still aint really shit thats why I moan
Like these guys dont even say nothing
Drugs and the guns then its back to the fronting
I swear mate I should of see it coming
Fakes the new real if I quote Joe Budden
I roll my weed and put another bud in
Knock at my door and I go and let my bud in
Another day mate and all we do is nothing
Im bored of this beef turn my back to the fronting
See raps full of zombies and I aint dead yet
Killing UK cunts thinking its Dead Set
Yes cause I dead sets ok now get set
Run tracks fuck rap this is the next step
Record on a PC its still poor quality
But every time I do it its still pure quality
Never take holiday one of my policies
Dont like the law so fuck what the police says
Putting up notices asking you to notice me
Just get my voice and my name so you know its me
You want to slag great take a note of you
See you at a show with a blade and I'm poking you
Just joking mate I know it aint fair though
Im not in your circle so you ask me for square goes
If I had a gun shoot at clowns like some fair shows
Scotland stand up but I take a chair though
Cause people here first still act like its their turf
Dont want the new kids like adoption at birth
Its like I'm adopting and plotting the worst
Thing to come out of Scotland since they heroin fucks
But every track every track is a stepping stone
I move past like fuck who I'm stepping on
If your offended by something I say
Then Say it to my face or get the fuck out the way
I went the fuck out the way just to make a CD
Done production and cutting you know it was me
All the pressing the stressing the artwork you see
Used to think ad just rap how blind could I be
I should of had CDs they got held back
That was ? mate I cant help that
Who to deal with I wasnt telt that
I learn from mistakes I just hope that they shelf that
And this rap thing is killing me
Looking at the real like it really aint real to me
Got to get a deal the day and thats what dealing with
But your so touchy you really aint feeling me
So I write a verse start putting it down
Only for a bunch of cunts to start putting me down
Its like they was stupid to doubt
Its me and Deek mate we aint needing you now
Cause every track every track is a stepping stone
I move past like fuck who I'm stepping on</pre>
