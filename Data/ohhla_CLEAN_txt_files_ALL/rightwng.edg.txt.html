[Ed O.G.]
Aiyyo Florida, why ain't you more into the crime
instead of sweatin rappers for the way they say a rhyme?
I thought your state was straight, lots of girls and very sunny
You're bein Bug-A-Boo's cause they black and makin money
Protestin and arrestin a rap group real quick
If there was a white rock band you wouldn't say shit
Oh shit, I said a swear, I'm appalled I shouldn't say this
You musta started swears cause this ain't even our language
The other man and sellouts, are constantly riffin
Porno flicks are legal talkin about it won't make a difference
2 Live is sellin gold, so somebody's lovin the
But you can't dig a nigga makin more than your governor
Hi-five to 2 Live, aiyyo T, pass the brew
Step to this, catch a fist, now tell me what to do

"Do, what you want to.." (2X)

[Ed O.G.]
The problem's not race, it's anything that's steamy
They arrested white people, for wearin bikinis
They said they're showin too much, I don't see, how y'all can take it
But when I go to Florida, I'm goin naked
And swearin, and rappin, and talkin bout sex
Full of Olde E, from my feet to my neck
I'll be the main attraction on the news at eight
Since drugs and murder, don't affect that state
The fear down there, I hope the cops don't see me
Rockin a rhyme, or wearin a bikini
Ed O.G. and the Bulldogs is a race not a crew
And no one can, tell us what to do

"Do, what you want to.." (2X)

[Ed O.G.]
Let me be me, and you be you
And don't criticize or worry about the things that I do
Because I like the way I am, and you cram to understand me
Talk all you want, but I don't give a damn see
Cause I'm me, my mother's only son
Don't try to be like me, cause God made only one
individual, who's original, just myself
It wouldn't be right, for me to be like, anyone else
I'm down with Luke duke, aiyyo I'm in so count me
Fuck the sheriff don't dare riff, when I step in Broward County
I ain't hearin it, cause in the 'Bury we don't fear that shit
This ain't a western, rap's a profession
So stop guessin, sit down and learn a lesson
Stand up for what's right, fight a fight, cause it could be you
And don't let no one, tell you what to do, aiyyo

"Do, what you want to.." (2X)</pre>
