[Chorus: Louieville Sluggah]
Niggas wanna be like Henny, niggas is mad cuz I'm Henny
Niggas even hate me cuz I'm Henny, still good and plenty, scream Henny
Up late, clonin pennies, sippin on Henny

[Louieville Sluggah]
I'm double parked on the Av., I see my staff
They watchin shorty wop jump out and into a Jag
She got harassed, she's mad, closed off fast
I'm yellin out to her, "Please, love don't crash"
But here they roll up the opposition
I had to form and make the D's, take a detour
Comin on these blocks, you gonna need more
Before we blow the door up off the hedges
Somethin for rememberin, all they knew was Timberlands
Had to switch up, cuz they swore it was our emblem
Bullshittin, traffic gave me tickets, snatched it then I ripped it
Jumped in, Rock flippin, now I'm out whippin

[Chorus: Doc Holiday]
Niggas want respect like Doc, bash ya phat check like Doc
Catch wreck on the block like Doc, hot sex on the spot like Doc
Ya niggas can't fuck wit me, that nigga D-O-C

[Doc Holiday]
Grease them wills, you lack the skills it takes to beat me
Try to greet me from behind, heard your hills was squeaky
Peep me, L S squared, double O blowin
Hot as my next flight, where you, where the fuck we goin?
Big tits, big ass, big lips, I bet it's D.D.
and that ho can't wait to see me
Charge everybody and for us it's a freebie
Word to my fam, and Breevoid, Omar and G.B.
And my brother's Kay, knockin down a quarter century
In the penitentiary, mad niggas mention me
If it's hell for you, nigga save a cell for me
While I loose these fools, tryin to pick and choose my destiny
Next to me, be my M.F.C. runnin shit
Walk that fine line between rhyme and crime syndicate
Been through it, from a corner to a sale
You'se a corner if you tell, Doc Holi' makin you yell

[Chorus: Starang Wondah]
Niggas wanna be like Starang, in the day blowin g like Starang
Word up push a fly v like Starang, aiyo ya bitch
niggas can't see Starang
Who? Roll a double d like Starang

[Starang Wondah]
Word up, word up, time after time, word up
After smoke dime after dime
and then commence to writin rhyme after rhyme
Word up, I outta let my nigga Doc knock ya head clear off
Actin like you don't know cuz my crew took a year off
And you can't recognize Henny because he cut his hair off
And then ya get into the streets, ya bitch ass wanna have a stare off
Niggas that I thought that I knew was live
Fucked up in the game, like niggas sellin two for five
They crew is jive, night after night losin sleep
Them niggas weak, ain't got no heat, and on they block can't eat
I'm strictly street, these wack niggas sware they be spittin
But I stay kickin better shit, on Christopher N. Pickens
Smokin and bullshittin, but it's different nowadays
A nigga stay in the studio, makin power plays
Word up, I turn on my television, you ain't even knowin that
Aiyo, this nigga flowin now, aiyo that's how it's goin down
Magnum Force ready for any showdown, word up
Still reppin from ninety now pass two thou'
When it's on, and it's on, word up, word up, word up</pre>
