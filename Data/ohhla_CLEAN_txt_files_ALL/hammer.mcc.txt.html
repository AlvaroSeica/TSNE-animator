[mc chris]
Economics! I love economics, hmmmm
(HEY over there! Where do you think you're going?)
I'm gonna go home!
(Thought you were gonna get out of school without talkin to me first?)
School's over I wanna go
(I got some recollections I'd like to share with you)
Ohh! Recollections on what?
(Let me think back on how many of your family members)
(CUNTS I've licked today!) Oh, how offensive!
(Let's see, your SISTER) Oh! (Your MOTHER) Not my mother!
(Your GRANDMOTHER!) My grandmother?
(I dug up your GREAT GRANDMOTHER) Oh, you wouldn't!
(Her cunt tasted like SKELETONS!) Oh, that's gross!
(HAHAHAHAHA~! AHAHAHA~!) HEY! How do you feel about THIS!?
(Oh my God! OHH!) I bought this gun at lunch!!
(Oh my God!) And now I am pointing it right at your face!!
I'm tired of the way you've been treating me!
And I'm not gonna take it anymore!!!
(Please! Please! I...I...looking at your gun)
(I'm, I'm rethinking all of my bullyism)
(And I...uh...I just think if I were to get a second chance)
You can't get a second chance
You are way too mean, and therefore, you deserve to get capped!!
I am pulling back the... thing that you pull back before you fire the gun!!
(The hammer?) NOW I AM PULLING THE TRIGGER!!
(OH MY GOD! YOU PULLED THE TRIGGER ON THE GUN)
(AND THE BULLET'S FLYING OUT OF THE GUN AT LIGHTNING SPEED!)
(AAH! OW! IT HIT ME IN THE HEAD!)
HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT, BULLY!? HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT!?
(AAH! OW! I'm dying, dying)
Wait a minute, what have I done? {*cries*}
I'm sorry... who will I talk to now?
What have I done... what have I done?</pre>
