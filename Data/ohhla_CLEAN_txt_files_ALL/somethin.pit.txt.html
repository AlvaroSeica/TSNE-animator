[Intro: Pitbull]
It's Pit, yeah
Up in this thang, yeah
With David Guetta, yeah
And Afrojack, yeah
Now all my ladies, yeah!
Go 'head get sexy, yeah! And
If you're sexy and you know it say oh yeah {*2X*}
If you're sexy and you know it and you really wanna show it
If you're sexy and you know it say oh yeah

[Chorus One]
If you're sexy and you know it clap your hands {*2X*}
If you're sexy and you know it and you really wanna show it
If you're sexy and you know it clap your hands (go DJ)

[repeat 3X]
Cut, scratch, go DJ
Don't, stop! Go DJ

[Pitbull]
Cut, scratch, go DJ
Tick, tick, tick, boom~!
How much wood could a woodchuck chuck
if a woodchuck could chuck wood?
You can catch Pit in the back with a mami, honest there's
no question, you know I'm all good
Now if you blink for a minute, think for a minute
I'ma drink for a minute, touch a girl in the middle like
Hold up, wait one minute!
Throw that three-oh-five up in it like

[Chorus Two]
Down, down, down, down-down
Down, down, down - turn that booty up
Round, round, round, round-round
Round, round, round - she likes to get
Down, down, down, down-down
Down, down, down - turn that booty up
Round, round, round, round-round
Round, round, round

[Chorus One]

[repeat 4X]
Cut, scratch, go DJ
Don't, stop! Go DJ

[Pitbull]
Tick, tick, tick, boom~!
How much wood could a woodchuck chuck
if a woodchuck could chuck wood?
You can catch me in the city, in the state, in the country
in the hood and you know I'm all good
Cause I've been raised by them wolves but I ain't play by the rules
As you can see I made my own moves
Mami is like, "Damn achiever that's cool"
Thank you mami now move - dale

[Chorus Two] + [Chorus One]

[repeat 4X]
Cut, scratch, go DJ
Don't, stop! Go DJ

[Pitbull]
Tick, tick, tick, boom~!</pre>
