{"Zombie on the track!"}

[Chorus: Drake]
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now my whole team fuckin here
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now the whole team here nigga
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now my whole team here nigga
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now the whole team fuckin here

[Drake]
I done kept it real from the jump
Livin at my momma house, we'd argue every month
Nigga I was tryin to get it on my own
Workin all night, traffic on the way home
And my uncle callin me like, "Where ya at?
I gave you the keys, told ya bring it right back"
Nigga I just think it's funny how it goes
Now I'm on the road, half a million for a show

[Chorus: Drake]
And we started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now my whole team fuckin here
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now the whole team here nigga
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now the whole team fuckin here
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now the whole team here nigga

[Drake]
Boys tell stories 'bout the man
Say I never struggled, wasn't hungry, yeah I doubt it nigga
I could turn your boy into the man
There ain't really much I hear that's poppin off without us nigga
We just want the credit where it's due
I'ma worry about me, give a fuck about you
Nigga just as a reminder to myself
I wear every single chain even when I'm in the house

[Chorus: Drake]
Cause we started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now my whole team fuckin here
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now the whole team here nigga

[Drake]
No new niggaz, nigga we don't feel that
Fuck a fake friend, where your real friends at?
We don't like to do too much explainin
Stories stay the same, I never changed it
No new niggaz, nigga we don't feel that
Fuck a fake friend, where your real friends at?
We don't like to do too much explainin
Stories stay the same through the money and the fame

[Wiz Khalifa]
Cause we {*inhales*}
Came in the game, went online and it changes
These fuck niggaz'll say it in ten different ways
then see you then smile in your face (smile in your face)
You wanna meet up, name a time or a place
I'm smokin that fire, my nigga you know that it's fire
You smell it as soon as I blaze it
Burnin a pound (pound) burnin a pound, burnin a pound
Yeah it's goin down (down) it's goin down, it's goin down
Uhh, started from the bottom now we here
Had a dream 'bout a car, I went and got it in a year
All black trucks when we pull up to the Lear
All black Coupe, I look like Bruce when I'm steerin
Hope the homie Drake don't get pissed
But niggaz never ever put your man on songs like this
And I probably said no to it before (it before)
But I made 20 million so we should probably go on tour
And I just seen Waka the other day (other day)
He wasn't trippin, we just talked about the money we been makin
Cause we

[Chorus: Drake] + (Wiz)
Started from the bottom now we're here (tahahahaha)
Started from the bottom now my whole team fuckin here (uhh)
Started from the bottom now we're here (a bunch of young niggaz man)
Started from the bottom now the whole team here nigga (we out doin this shit)
Started from the bottom now we're here (and we all up now)
Started from the bottom now my whole team here nigga
Started from the bottom now we're here (real shit)
Started from the bottom now the whole team</pre>
