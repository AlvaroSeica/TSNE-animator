[Random]
See in everybody's life there's a time where
You just gotta step up, no matter how unprepared you might be
Got to do it

I don't much about the blanks, but I remember that day
that they invaded, and took all of my innocence away
I wish it was a dream, man you wouldn't believe what I seen
An invasion by some alien breed
I cain't scream, gotta man up, not even a team - but
Trying times call for desperate means
So let me, set the scene, we peaceful people
Ambushed by the seeds of evil
The person I look up to the most, that's my dad
Yeah he can cast, he's got skills I could only dream to have
But times are bad, man my land is destroyed
And I'm bound to make my old man proud of his boy
They overran the town, they don't plan on leavin
So they called me down to the Middon region
I utilized the skills that I learned in life
Hopin one day I earn the right, to be known as

A caster, savin my land from disaster
A caster, blast ya, only cause I have ta
Caster, work harder, get stronger, move faster
A caster, dreamin of bein a master

A caster - as I go on now I'm gainin experience
Workin crazy hard and now it's drivin me delirious
Now there's a company that's called Engain
Who claims that they can help us fight back cause it's insane
Cause we at odds with a foe unlike any other
The more I destroy, the more we uncover
I hope and pray we ain't gotta do this much longer
But with every defeat, I'm feelin stronger
I'm jumpin higher now, and runnin faster
With my speed I'm dodgin they blasts with ease
Indeed defy gravity, refuse to be a casualty
My family right in back of me, dazzled by my mastery
Makin it look effortless, anyone who step to this
is gettin taken out, I cast with extreme prejudice
But there's more to be done before the war's one
But the fight of my life has begun, I'm
