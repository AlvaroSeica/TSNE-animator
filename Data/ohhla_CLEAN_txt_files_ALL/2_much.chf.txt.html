Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
I say these hoes ain't shit
I'm not trippin on no thot
I don't like conversations
You gone let me fuck or not
While these niggas sneak dissin
I'll be tourin gettin gwap
I be Flexin on these suckas
Pullin' up in foreign drop
These hoes say I'm too much
I think I'm to much
A nigga try Almighty Sosa he get touched
These hoes be tryin' too much
Doin too much
Bitch I couldn't call your phone I was doin too much

[Verse]
They say I smoke too much
Lean too much
T- Roy my shooter and he will shoot ya
I put Tadoe in the cut Fredo was in it too much
If you ain't on that opp shit than we salute ya
I get money too much
Spend it too much
And if you try to take it then my niggas shoot ya
When I throw it in the air these hoes be doin' too much
When we leave a bitch with too many hoes we bought a tour bus
I just got Kay Kay a check we finna hit Toys R Us
Spent 20 thousand dollars think I bought her too much
I just got Kay Kay a check we finna hit Toys R Us
Spent 20 thousand dollars think I bought her too much

[Chorus]</pre>
