Yup, mm-hmm, yeah
There's a rainbow everywhere depending on where you stand
Whether the dashboard or yay, or the walls a hundred grand each
Double R interior tan, outside is peach
Oh you tryin to make a deal out in Golden Beach
Or the Florida Keys, duckin the Florida D's
But you only end up with bricks of sand
I know niggaz that run from they shadows like Peter Pan
Runnin like it's a Nike commercial but he's the man
What he don't like on sight he murk like he's the Klan
8-balls the size of baseballs like Jeter's hand
It's fecal fam, yeah it's the shit
Zip your face up when Skateboard is on the strip
Catch me in the Gap V with some BBC trunks
Flip-flops, sippin on cream, like it's punch
I push the spaceship with the chrome lady in the front
Bendin over like she just puffed Busta's blunt
I told y'all muh'fuckers once
I think I'm hungry, finna eat y'all niggaz lunch; y'all niggaz cunts
I'm from the, commonwealth, my wealth ain't common
when niggaz roll around with chrome solvers lookin for problems
Mouth full of gold, flame when they roll
Arthritic fingers, niggaz bang when they stroll
Traded in the hats for the cane and the gold
The golds for the chain and the cane was on swole
Aiyyo Tip, get these peon niggaz told

[T.I.]
Still stand tall when it all falls down
Whether Hollywood Hills or a one-horse town
You should know better
There's no better than these fo' letters
More than ever niggaz want me dead
Cause they starvin and I'm gettin fed
But fuck 'em anyway, I'd rather be me on my worst day
Then to be a sucka nigga on his birthday
All cake no candles, just a livin example
Ten toes down, all out, no sandals
+Godfather+, young Marlon Brando
Let me make sure they understand yo
Hear ye, hear ye - you wise you fear me
Real niggaz on they shine, much obliged, merci
Everybody wanna criticize him
by how bad he ended up, look how bad he coulda been
I coulda caught a body, sold a brick to somebody
who volunteered my information to the federales
I made it outta all of that like I ain't gon' be proud of that
So petty shit you stickin to me give me all you got of that
Doin this for all my niggaz
who'd rather go to prison than to let a nigga kill him
So he leavin his P.O. snub nose in his denim
Trap or death is waitin 'round the corners that he been in
On bended knee, God forgive us, we've been sinnin
In our defense look at the options we was given
Layin in the prison cell starin at the ceiling
Back in this bitch again, guess they wasn't bullshittin, huh?
Still wonder where it all went wrong
Since Phil got killed I ain't never moved on
Like I'm still in the club where the blows got thrown
When my crown fell down and I got dethroned
Bunch of niggaz around, but I feel all alone
Like a piece of me is missin, guess it never came home
Probably died in the van when it all hit the fan
Save the life of a friend, we don't all get the chance
Now here I stand, with blood in my hands
Tryin hard to explain so his mom understand
I mean fought for the loss of the soul of a man
Only soldiers know how that'll take a toll on a man
Burdens on the world on my shoulders, heavy
Visibly composed my emotions, buried
Scary, so if I pop a pill
Smoke a blunt or take a shot, y'all let a nigga live
Still baffled how my life unravelled
In the meantime time just travelled
Can't see behind the walls of my castle
Opinionated peons son, but who asked you?
I'll tell you what you do, take your two cents
Kick rocks to a fountain, pitchin and make a wish
Shit, if wishes had wings
they'd all make it to heaven and we'd all be kings
Hahaha, if wishes had wings
they'd all make it to heaven and we'd all be kings
