816 Boyz!
Ain't we sick boy?

[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]
All gas
No brakes
All ass
Gon shake

We gon do it, do it
We gon do it, do it
We gon do it, do it, do it

[Verse 1: Krizz Kaliko]
I'm tryna get tall (so tall)
I don't remember
Same as day n cold (so cold)
Calling December
Wanna get at ya so I'm acting like I'm shy
Then I'm grabbing your (armways[?]), you try to walk by
(How you doing?)
Bought a couple of shots of Patrone
Hands all over me, won't leave me alone
(Green light!)
Now I think I might take her home
One more shot in the bottle
Got my liquor weed gone (Hey!)
Now we in whip on the way
Told her I got a blind boat and you can know where I'll stay
I was until, she the same way
She said "I'm ready for you to kill it"
I'm like okay! (Okay!)
Got it right there in car
Club around the corner
We don't have to go far
Gave it up easy, cause she know I'm a star
All gas no brakes, I ain't talking bout my car

[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]
All gas
No brakes
All ass
Gon shake

We gon do it, do it
We gon do it, do it
We gon do it, do it, do it

[Verse 2: Kutt Calhoun]
I gotta rough Carabou Lou
You can guess what's next
If you didn't know that I'm the bunk rock king
Let's bet, that homie I'm bout to get it, get it
Straight to the mall and hit it, split it
Stroll that dough [?] and wants to find now
She split it, with it
I was all gas, no brakes
Kutty Cal gave her something
She prolly didn't want to taste
So I told her, mama give it just a second
Then it prolly won't be so
Until I hit her with the flex again
Then I'm screaming "Oh!"

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Give it her cricket if you're with it
And pure wicked, you gonna get just [?] a sure ticket
[?] stick it
N9ne has got your bodily, fine is what you gotta be
Vaginas were comradery, cause I'm a hot commodity
I am such an animal, I am not a human being
I just want my antidote, wrapping her whore like it's screw between
I don't give a damn if it is black or european
Pumping the gas, her ass, she for shoulda cream

[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]
All gas
No brakes
All ass
Gon shake

We gon do it, do it
We gon do it, do it
We gon do it, do it, do it

[Verse 4: Krizz Kaliko]
Yep baby got a nice face
Big booty and a tight waist
And if I tip her, she might shake
That booty up in my face
