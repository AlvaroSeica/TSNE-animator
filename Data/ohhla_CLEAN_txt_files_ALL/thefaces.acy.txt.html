Right there...cool

Come here
Let me holler at you face to face
See ace been place to place
I seen a million of em
They look at me for a split second
Then they grin, never to be seen again
But it's locked in, so I can read every line
Its written all over your upside down mind
With an upside down smile
Whoops upside your head, well hey now
I never forget a face, especially your's
Because the mirror is the only dimension without flaws
I look out till again
And then begin to look out for the faces of men
Cause I done been face to face with a serpent
Demon is the same think it is when it aint
White like snow or black like coal
Yellow like the moon and red(read) like a book
To live or die is the plot but the face is the hook
So meet the face from left field
3 eyes two ears one nose and a grill, but still remain faceless

oh ya

(chorus)
Let me holler at you face to face
See ace been place to place
I seen plenty of em
But don't let the face fool ya
There's so many of em, but still remain faceless
Let me holler at you face to face
See ace been place to place
I seen plenty of em
But don't let the face fool ya
There's so many of em, but still remain faceless


So can I take a poloroid? -say cheese-
Of the face that got you employed -please-
Same face your momma enjoyed as a boy
Will be the same face that will get you destroyed
Now you got to face the facts, face the music
You cannot about face it and turn back when you abuse it
So wisdoms use it wise, bat thoses eyes, show them teeth
Lick them lips even powder them cheeks
So while your passin', im askin' myself
I wonder if she knows what I'm looking at
Well look at that, a face that got me looking back
I can see the history in your bone structer
I can see the misery in your frown
So smile now and cry later
Or just walk around with the face of a clown and still remain faceless

I said smile now and cry later
Or just walk around with the face of a clown and still remain faceless


Let me holler at you face to face
See ace been place to place
I seen plenty of em
But don't let the face fool ya
There's so many of em, but still remain faceless
Let me holler at you face to face
See ace been place to place
I seen plenty of em
But don't let the face fool ya
There's so many of em, but still remain faceless


Do you know how far a face can take you?
It can make you or break you, or inflate you
They're either going to love you or hate you
Or never notice you if you're a face they don't relate to
You fear my face, don't wanna get near my face
You get judged by your mug, they didn't hear your case
Now face the wall -face the wall!-
Your face is against the law
You look at me I look at y'all
I recelect everything I saw in the face of the prowl
But im just another face in the crowd -just another face in the crowd-
To figure that at face value is not allowed
Tell it to my face, and tell it to me now
Tryin' to mad dog, but you got the face of a puppy dog
Like a puppet, just like a baby doll
Ain't that right baby face? cutie pie?
Good lookin'? twinkle in your daddies eye?
And then scarface replied I was born with a face I can't hide
-a face I can't hide- a face full of pride
A face that's been denide on sight
I reconize the face but the name slips by
But still your not faceless
Yo
