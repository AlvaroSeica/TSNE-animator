Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
You can't deny me, baby, why would you want to, you need me
You can't deny me, baby you want to, you need me
Can't deny me, baby you want you, believe me
Can't deny me, baby you want you, you need me

I'm rap... back to attack the store kill my mom's bedroom
And deliver the baggy a crack 'cause I rap... since for you the match box
... superstitious like level fifty in black...
is that dirtyness, got to see it stores like
... kill them with the wordly shit,.. with the mother fucker..
... spent in... baby everything I said..
Papa next pill moving on the next kill
First agree murder beats with the best skill
Running shit like mister Hankie on the treadmill
They don't even understand what I've been raping
Tarring down Mike... see in Manhatan
I just try to hate but can't compete..
... kid... scratching

[Chorus]
You can't deny me, why would you want to, you need me
You can't deny me, baby you want to, believe me
Can't deny me, why would you want you, you need me
Can't deny me, baby you want to, you need me

Speak in tight every day I'm being Mike wanna be the Asia... arrest the Condoleezza Rice
Plus it's right... with Jesus Christ
'Cause there's a lot of cheese all I want to freak in slice
Any chick... double Jesus all I need,.
And if she cooks I reconsider if I need a wife
They see my skin coloured so they don't believe I'm nice
But they don't mad if I'm black, blue, green or white
'Cause I've been killed around since my adolescence
I kill a bee mother fucker better grab a medic
I'm working a girlfriend white like... and... sexual wishes just like a... and sadic
From the past to present I get attacked revenges to... like a... crack dependence
Try to get my money and... and spend it
And take my competition... just like a..

[Chorus]
You can't deny me, why would you want to, you need me
You can't deny me, baby you want to, believe me
Can't deny me, why would you want you, you need me
Can't deny me, baby you want you, believe me
Can't deny me, why would you want to?

Can't deny me, baby you want to, believe me</pre>
