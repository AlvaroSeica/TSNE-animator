[Intro: Bruno Mars]
I wanna be a billionaire, so fuckin bad
Buy all of the things I never had
I wanna be on the cover of, Forbes magazine
Smiling next to Oprah and the Queen
Oh every time I close my eyes
I see my name in shining lights, yeah
A different city every night, oh I, I swear
The world better prepare, for when I'm a billionaire

[Travie McCoy]
Yeah I would have a show like Oprah, I would be the host of
Everyday Christmas, give Travie a wish list
I'd probably pull an Angelina and Brad Pitt
and adopt a bunch of babies that ain't never had shit
Give away a few Mercedes like "Here lady, have this"
And last,but not least, grant somebody their last wish
It's been a couple months that I've been single, so
You can call me Travie Claus, minus the hoe hoe
Get it? I'd probably visit where Katrina hit
and damn sure do a lot more than FEMA did
Yeah, can't forget about me stupid
Everywhere I go I'ma have my own theme music

[Bruno Mars] + (Travie)
Oh every time I close my eyes (What you see? What you see, bro?)
I see my name in shining lights (Uh-huh, uh-huh, and what else?)
A different city every night, oh I, I swear (Uhh - yeah, yeah, yeah)
The world better prepare (for what?) For when I'm a billionaire
Ohh-ohhh, oh-ohh - for when I'm a billionaire
Ohh-ohhh, oh-ohh

[Travie McCoy]
Let's go!
I'll be playin basketball with the President, dunkin on his delegates
then I'll compliment him on his political etiquette
Toss a couple milli in the air just for the heck of it
but keep the fives, twentys, tens and Bens completely separate
And yeah, I'll be in a whole new tax bracket
We in recession, but let me take a crack at it
I'll probably take whatever's left and just split it up
So everybody that I love can have a couple bucks
And not a single tummy around me
would know what hungry was - eatin good, sleepin soundly
I know we all have a similar dream
Go in your pocket pull out your wallet, put it in the air and sing

[Bruno Mars] + (Travie McCoy)
I wanna be a billionaire, so fuckin bad (so bad)
Buy all of the things I never had (buy everything! haha)
I wanna be on the cover of, Forbes magazine
Smiling next to Oprah and the Queen (Whattup Oprah? Ah-hah~!)
Oh every time I close my eyes (What you see? What you see, bro?)
I see my name in shining lights (Uh-huh, uh-huh, and what else?)
A different city every night, oh I, I swear (Uhh - yeah, yeah, yeah)
The world better prepare (for what?) For when I'm a billionaire (YEAH!)
Ohh-ohhh, oh-ohh (sing it) for when I'm a billionaire
Ohh-ohhh, oh-ohh (ohh!)

I wanna be a billionaire
So fuckin bad... (eh-hehe)</pre>
