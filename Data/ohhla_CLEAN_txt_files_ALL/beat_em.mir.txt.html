Hook

Beat 'em down to da' flo' (x8)

Okay, Okay
I want war over poverty and pain over peace
Sometimes I sit and fuckin' wonder "Am I more about the peace?"
My pistol clicked and released
And bust a nut when I squeeze
And have a orgasm every time a punk pussy bleed
Feel me, a nigga better kill me
Make sure that I'm dead and then my nigga bury me
I mourn, then I put a lock on my coffin so I can never escape
Look at my enemies smile when they come to my wake
Killin' me was a mistake, that's how I know that you're fake
Now I'm the master of your soul, the captain of your fate
Down here, hell out the way, in the hung I-E-A
Trap a snitch, trick, nigga were a dumb bitch stay 
I put it all on the plate, cheese, eggs, Welch's grape
Kaopate, cause I'm the shit nigga, all damn day
And what I say?
Ain't no play, down here where I stay
I'm from that motherfuckin' G to the A
Home of the french-braid, A-K, Cadillac Escalade
.45 Glock with dots, sawed off for this murder mission
With the gold, my heart is turnin' cold
I got plenty fuckin' pot, but I ain't seen no gold
I got to let y'all niggas know, we gonna drop these fuckin' 'bows
Stand toe to fuckin' toe, beat your ass down to da flo'

Hook

My dick is fuckin' dirty, so I'm tainted with blood
I'm a motherfuckin' thug, don't know the meaning of love
After thinkin' 'bout the blood my nigga must spill
Sometimes I sit up at night thinkin' "How he got killed?"
I'm feelin' guilt that them niggas who did it is still breathing
I'll run up on them fuckers in Hunting Season
Physco at it, lunatic, I ain't 'bout to fuck shit
Kill a snitch, take a shit, mercy; never heard of it
I was sent to rock this bitch
Take this fucker to the ground
Yea', I'm bound, burn it down, ain't none nigga finna' stop me now
Do you hear me?
Can you feel me?
Bitch you'd better fuckin' kill me
Eighteen to the chest, hope you're wearing a fuckin' vest
I'm about to make a mess, survival is my only test
All the shit you done did, hell naw, I can't forget
I ain't lyin', I ain't cryin', I ain't no fuckin' Ginuine
Sang to nann hoe, fuck nigga, die slow
I'm uh make this coward moan "Aug Thug" 
Red bone, fuck what you heard nigga
I'm the king, I'm the don
Last shown, every song, bad to the fuckin' bone
Wish all these haters would leave me the fuck alone
Mission with the gold, my heart is turnin' cold
I got plenty fuckin' pot but I ain't seen no gold
I got to let y'all niggas know, we gonna drop these fuckin' 'bows
Stand toe to damn toe, beat your ass down to the flo'

Hook

Stop there, uppercut
Nigga it's time to ball</pre>
