Song:   Don't Stop
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

When everytime I close my eyes and I see your face
And I know ain't a thing in this world that will ever take your place
When I'm gone just know that them things won't change
And I know ain't a thing in the world that will ever take your place

Like a rhythm you play or a drum that you feel
My love for you well you know that it's real
All that she's sayin' and all that she'll do
My love for her well I know that it's true

I don't stop, stop the way I feel, because I love you
Lord I won't stop, stop the way I feel because I love you

You gotta smile that lights up my life and I won't let go
I see the moon and the stars in your eyes and I'm wantin' you to know
It's been some time you've been in my life since the day we've met
I think of you and the times that we've had I never will forget

Like a rhythm you play or a drum that you feel my love for you
Well you know that it's real
All that she's sayin' and all that she'll do
My love for her well you know that it's true
I don't stop</pre>
