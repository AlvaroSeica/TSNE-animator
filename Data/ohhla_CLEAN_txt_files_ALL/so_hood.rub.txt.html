Typed by: Cno Evil

[Rubbabandz]
Hold on to your four leaf clover, here come a soldier
Take rolling right by me, ya'll niggas chocha
Look like a capy type, slacks and penny loafers
I'm running the town fatigued down with the toaster
Machine gun, ya'll playing with Super Soakers
M-16 homeboy, I rob Oprah
Obese weight, Donald Trump cake
I even run up on Bill Gates, muthafucka
I be that kid in the heavy Chevy leaning
Look at my wrist how it's gleaming
Try to rob me, nigga, you dreaming
Always talking that New York slang
I go the four fifth infered beaming
Come on, dude, stop schemeing
I got my hand on the 'istol, when I'm fiending
Then pop a shell in you, wake up, I caught you sleeping

[Chorus: Rubbabandz]
And my status so hood
I can go to any ghetto in the world, they ain't messing with me
Cuz I'm a general, and my soldiers busting for me
I got that love in the hood if you know what I mean
My status so hood
I can go to any ghetto in the world, they ain't messing with me
Cuz I'm a general, and my soldiers busting for me
So fresh, so clean, if you know what I mean

[Rubbabandz]
I like them birds 'cross the water from the B.K.
Know how to suck a dick three ways
I'm always getting brains on the freeway
A real city slicker, New York nigga with game
She got the Timbs on, mini skirt and micro braids
I got a room at the Holiday
Room service all night, I got that purple haze
And we can smoke and chill until the next day

[Chorus]

[Rubbabandz]
I'm the general going to war with the kid
It could get critical, you don't no problem, boy
I will get rid of you, rat poison your food
You think I'm breaking bread wit you, hot hollow heads
My boy, they will get in to you
I know it burns, but ya'll niggas got to learn
I'mma spread like germs, I'm at my pinacle
You know who I be, F.S.G.
I got the whole New York with me, come on</pre>
