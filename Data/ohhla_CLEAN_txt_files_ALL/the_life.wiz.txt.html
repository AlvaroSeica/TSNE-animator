Yeah! It's young Khalifa man, Curren$y the hot spitta
Look in the mirror man ask yourself one thing hahahaha
How Fly yeahhh

[Wiz Khalifa]
Foot on the gas, I'm fast living picture me I ain't have no pot to piss in
Now I'm checking bags chief and hash with politicians helicopter pads some hoes
To get to know and hella zags, no tagss
I ain't one to brag but if you ain't trying to hear
About the money drugs and women then I ain't one to asskkk
Smoke so much that I'm going brain dead
Hoes mad at me cause my phone off until my plane land
I tell her Whoa!... slow down baby
The spitta with me it's enough to go round lady
You drive by I give her wings Red Bull
and Jim buckets of a couple paper planes
broadcasting my name over internet airwaves
bitches hear me on twitter put my music on there MySpace pages
yeah! if you smoke then roll up and play this
me and hot spitta come where the planes is

[Curren$y]
She said she wants to sip clicquot on my living room flo'
smoke weed hang with other famous people I know
gain access to exclusive places I go lavish and dangerous
Is the life I chose, but I wouldn't change it for nothin
Sex, money and drugs wrong way
Sports cars and luggage better to be somebody for one day
then to be a nobody for your whole life so fuck it!
Yeah get the cork out the bottle put the purp in the easy wider
Spitta in the house, hide your lighters I take em
a case I mistake them indented in my bed for
I couldn't swore I brought this one in with me
in the cinnamon interior 9 10 to early 80's
buy chevy with a great engine
high jacking your women you left her unattended
Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Fly when I'm on that liquor
the way of the samurai I got my chi centered sharp as blades
These bars I lay forever the player and never played
I slay them bitches I never save
bomb ass trees they get blazed
Palm trees we use them for the shade
What else can I say I got it made
Like I had it built taylor gang or get killed
Yeah!</pre>
