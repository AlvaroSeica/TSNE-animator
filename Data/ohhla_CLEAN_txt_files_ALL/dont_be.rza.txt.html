[Intro: RZA]
This mic is scared of me, son
It's like I'm gonna rape it
Ason in my heart... I date rape mics, my mic's a dike
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo

[Chorus 2X: The Emotions "I Like It" sample]
Don't be afraid to call my name
Don't be afraid to call my name
Don't be afraid to call my name
Don't be afraid to call my name

[RZA]
I've been blessed by the sin of cathedrals, I'm Regal royal
Spoiled, I sleep with paralegals
And tongue kiss lawyers and cops, buy a pound of chocolate
Off the block, then I puff with the NARC's
My Clan's wild cannibal, Wu, and my man'll shoot
Blaow, leave your cold grip as rare like the sandal shoe
From banana head chunks, propaganda pumps
Leave 'em buried on the Staten Island dump
Tap the mic on the floor, chains to the Mighty Thor
Two blades on my arm, look like the God of War
Ason in my heart, yeah, I like it raw
Words in the apple, I'mma bite it to the core
Digitech, used to call me Prince Dynamite
Cuz when I blew up the set, you couldn't find a mic
Leave your ass in the dark, you can't find the light
You been wrong so long, you can't find the right
Way to speak, I spend a day on the beats
Then a day on the paper, then a date on the beach
Then a night in the sheets with fine wizzes, dime wizzes
Who don't waste time to get straight down to business
Zig Zag, make your girl catch a whip lash
Tried to look when she seen the God zip past
Money stack high up like a skyscraper
Fly shorties getting stuck to my fly paper
Now we march to the monument
You see the seven in the star on the amulet?
Don't allow negative in my circumference
You can't understand, son, you incompetent
The P is free, would you fuck for a million bucks?
Keep the steel concealed, in the wheeler trucks
Shakwan put the rhinestone on the rims
Timbo King put the rhinestones on his Timbs
We live this life each and every day
We all trying to make it a better way
If you miss the words that I say
Hit pause, record, and hit play
I'm backed by a beautiful strong wiz
Bless all to the Earths and all the kids
Long live the god Divine and Big Free
Young seeds and great kings

[Chorus 4X]</pre>
