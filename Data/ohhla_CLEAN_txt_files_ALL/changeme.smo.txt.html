Song:   Change Around Me
Typed by: ST

Ya, ya, ya, we all stuck in it
stuck in a perpetual cycle of poverty
shit, I don't see nothing change around me

[Verse 1]
Head shaven, I'm losing my hair
garms stained
walking with a thousand yard stare
see man like you
there's a thousand out there
thought they were untouchable
till I laid em out bare
I hang around places
where hos buy crack selling pussy
and mouth favours, them bitches got wild faces
in Highfields, hos walk around in high heels
making snide deals
keeping they eyes peeled for nice wheels
Disgraced in this place where base is blatantly baking
ticks follow tremors til ya whole hand is shaking
you too could be taken
with no self respect or inspiration
that's the destination that your facing
You could be the mouth that escaped
from the council estate, and turn it round
in a way, that made the crowd look amazed
Cos mate, if you fiend for a piece of crack
there's no peace in that, dealing with police and that
I'm your homunculus, hopping around in your hippocampus
in shitty pampers, riding hippos all over campus
listen Dorothy, we are no longer in Kansas
check out what is written on the canvas, it goes
Yo Smokee, light that inspiration</pre>
