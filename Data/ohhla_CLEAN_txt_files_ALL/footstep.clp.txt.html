[Pusha T]
Follow the leader, exhaust pipes and breathers
The flash from the barrel turns bullies to believers
The time of a life make the bitches wanna keep ya
This is my reality, want it? Well, let me teach ya
Follow my Footsteps through tragedy and triumph
Through flows I give you Mein Kampf
Kilos consigned 'em, do as I +Say+ like +Simon+
And you too will diamond blind, hun
I'm on my Dylan, Dillinger, flow just killin' ya
Ya wonder why the real ain't feelin ya, ya fraudin'
I Maison ya'll Martin Margiela hos together 
since Hov' was name droppin' Charles Jordan (Yuk!)
I kept 'em noddin, snortin', slobbin', barfin', then bought cars off 'em
The realest rapper that unwrapped and docked 'em, 
If you can fit these shoes then walk 'em, I parked 'em

[Chorus]
Coulda been a goner, but I had to save my soul (save my soul)
I'm out here chasin' my dreams, lookin' for a place to go (place to go)
Tryin' to get up out the ghetto? Come follow in my Footsteps
Put down the heavy metal and, Follow in my footsteps
'Cause if ya don't it might be danger

[Malice]
It's not for you to do as I do, rather do as I say
These Footsteps could lead you astray,
Lead you to the cell or lead you to a grave
Either way you may never see the light of day
Don't let my wrongs give ya the right of way
To emulate my past, escapin' the law's grasp
Told you the truth yet who was I to brag?
Especially seeing how Kimani finds it hard to laugh
I miss my homie but she's missing her dad
It weighs on my conscience and I hate conscious rap (Footsteps)
Apart from that I wish to see you succeed
So I speak to my people in the spirit of Chuck D
You behind the glass, trust me it cut deep
Then the words to every verse haunted me in my sleep
So now what you see is Malice and contradiction
He who has ears hope you listenin'
C'mon

[Chorus]

[Malice]
Follow me like Twitter, nigga, you can check my timeline
I'm the quiet one but my intellect is Einstein
I'm so unnerved by the shit that I've observed
Just lookin' at you coons got a nigga lost for words
Verge of insanity I'm at my crossroads
Shame on the birds that led 'em like lost souls
We got it wholesale, we move it like Costco
Mercy on the court left us standin' here heartbroke

[Pusha T]
I taught you how to cut it, cook it on hot stoves
I taught you how to share 'em, when fuckin' with hot hos
Taught you how to rock right shit up on your toes
I taught you how to smile for the camera when heartbroke
I been the inspiiration for all you industry dick-tasters
To you local dream chasers I am king push
I set the stage for all these triple beam hooks!
I weigh mountains, while them niggas just sing hooks!

(Ooh Ooh Ooh) Your momma said
(Ooh Ooh Ooh) Oh your grand-momma said
(Ooh Ooh Ooh) Oh your baby sister said
(Ooh Ooh Ooh) Your nigga said (yeah)
(Ooh Ooh Ooh) Now your whole block was sayin'
(Ooh Ooh Ooh) Oh your old teacher said
(Ooh Ooh Ooh) Your Misses said
(Ooh Ooh Ooh) Your preacher said (yeah)
