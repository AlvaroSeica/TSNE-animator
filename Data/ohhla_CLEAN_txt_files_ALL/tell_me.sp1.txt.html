(Intro):
Yeah, what's up fool
9-4, Spice 1
Kickin' that G shit
Tell me what that mail like nigga
Wanna make money
This one or get smoked

(Verse 1):
Push it in push it out
And I be the nigga with the muthafuckin' Glock
Yeah, shoulda knew it was a baller muthafuckin' G
Hoppin' out a goddamn 94 Cherokee
Dumpin' shit like a muthafuckin' cooper scoop a 
Nigga off his feet with the millami the Ruger
So tell me what that mail like
I keep processin' of the yea for cells [?] tell like
Throw away Gats bubble gum pimps 
And 2 dollar bitches on my nut sack
And it was all a part of being young
My little nuts hung
Fascinated by the Tommy gun
Niggas throwin' up sets this is murder tonight
But fuck that shit nigga
Tell me what that mail like

[ talkin ]
Tell me what that mail like

(Verse 2):
Po-Po's wanna quiet me
Cause I was tearin' up shit like the muthafuckin' liar G
Wax and Tat's from my nigga Andrew Jackson
Movin' ki's in large fractions
And this is the American dream
To a young muthafucka age 13 to 19
He used to be my best friend
But the system got us bustin' at each other over Franklin
And that little white bitch got the whole world smoked up
And then it be causin' them niggas to loc up
Smokin' muthafuckas cause they asked me :
Ay, nigga, do your momma smoke D
That's the shit I gotta deal with
Real last niggas can you feel it
Tell me what that mail like

[ talkin ]
Tell me what that mail like

(Verse 3):
Gotta live up to my rap as a G
Still countin' mail age 23
See me and Franklin they can't stop us
And now I got no friends I done smoked all my patnas
I never thought that the money will definitely kill ya'll
4 lil' young muthafuckas robbin' liquor stores
It's all good patna get your cash 
Till one of them got panicky and started to blast
I took 2 to the chest and 1 to the gut
Lyin' on the ground confused as fucked
I guess it had to take the bullet 
To prove that the way I grew up was bullshit
Lucky for me I had my vest on
Cause I wouldn't look too gritty with my chest gone
Fool, and I'm back I'll be slangin' them D
Got a nut in my pocket way unleased a G
See I'm a soldier in the shit you can tell right, nigga
So tell me what that mail like

[ talkin ]
Tell me what that mail like</pre>
