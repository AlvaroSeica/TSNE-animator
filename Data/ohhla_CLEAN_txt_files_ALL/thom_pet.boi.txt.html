[Chorus]
Thom Pettie that ho
Thom Pettie that ho
Thom Pettie that ho
Free fallin', Thom Pettie
Thom Pettie that ho
Thom Pettie that ho
Thom Pettie that ho
Freefallin', we up all night

[Big Boi]
I brought one chain for medallion
With a whole lot of motherfucking diamonds
It's astoundin' like when I be rhymin'
Always shinin' like the sun and moon
Like a hot air balloon requires fire
No methamphetamine, but nigga, we get higher!
Big Boi, dopamine, I mean, I'm dope
Ain't near when you niggas can't even come close
Simple fat sacks
Been a serial killer, oh, nice to meet you, best believe that
Like Ripley's boy, don't tempt me
I fuck around and leave your Kool-aid glass half empty
Your time is running, I'm just like the sand in it
Been jamin' in half and half of you niggas know you can't get it
That's right, it as in IT
We like the Apple on your iPhone, niggas always bitin'

[Chorus]
Thom Pettie that ho
Thom Pettie that ho
Thom Pettie that ho
Free fallin', Thom Pettie
Thom Pettie that ho
Thom Pettie that ho
Thom Pettie that ho
Freefallin', we up all night

[Yukimi Nagano]
Oooohhh!!
We shinin' like the sun and moon
All of your wishes fallin' through
They chasin' after you
And climbin' up the moon
Oooohhh!!
We shinin' like the sun and moon
All of your wishes falling through
They chasin' after you
And climbin' up the moon

[*Guitar Solo*]

[Killer Mike]
(Motel, hotel)
Motel, hotel
Intercontinental, all cause a nigga push a pencil
That's an S550, not a rental
Bitch, I don't even ride Lincoln Continentals
In the rear seat is a fat black nigga with a smile like Denzel
Pretty model bitch with me moving 'bout as graceful as a gazelle
Skinny as a pencil, foreign like a pretzel
Hit her with the XL
Just in case this funky ass bitch was doing Intel
I'mma give her news she can go tell
Snitchin' ass bitches get evicted, no bus fair
Grown ass women ride a Bentley that's so clear
I'm so player, SpottieOttieDopaliscious
Mama phony, but I swear to God the pussy dope and she delicious
One time for my wife and my mistress, gone

[Chorus]
Thom Pettie that ho
Thom Pettie that ho
Thom Pettie that ho
Free fallin', Thom Pettie
Thom Pettie that ho
Thom Pettie that ho
Thom Pettie that ho
Freefallin', we up all night

[Yukimi Nagano]
Oooohhh!!
We shinin' like the sun and moon
All of your wishes falling through
They chasin' after you
And climbin' up the moon</pre>
