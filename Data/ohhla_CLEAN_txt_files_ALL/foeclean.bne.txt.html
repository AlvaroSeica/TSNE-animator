Hook:
[Satasha] For the love of money
[Bizzy]   Gotta make that money, man
[Krayzie] That money, mayne, it's still the same now
[Bizzy]   Gotta make that money, man
[Krayzie] That money, mayne, it's still the same now

(Verse 1)
[Flesh-N-Bone]
Gotta get on the grind
Givin' it up to the nine-nine, don't be stupid cause y'all get falled
In the night time, gotta get mine
Ain't takin' no shorts or no losses
Hop on the phone, call up my homie, Tay at home, polishin' his Mack 10 chrome
Got a lick, we can hit, so call the clique, cause once again, it's on
To the dome, with a fifth of Bourb'
More wig to the curb, so I swerve and rolled out
To pick up the rest of my thugs, then sprayed on the mission for callin' up more, now
Choke, when I hit the bong, fill the ride like everyday
With four Mo Thugs I'm a roll with and stroll with
Til we get up on the grave and lay
Pulling in me driveway
Wish spotted the place and quickly rolled up
Gotta make that money, mayne, hopped out of the ride, then Flesh done showed up
Buck, buck, and a kaboom, so drop it all down when I'm into the room
Then doom
I'm a shakin' the dice and hittin' me naturals on them fools
And I'm looking lovely
You better not think it's funny
I'm comin' up quick in the nine-quads, cause Flesh be lovin' this money

[Layzie Bone]
I'm givin' up love
To the hustlers, all them St. Clair dusters
Makin' that money stayin' on your feet
And you better believe, gotta have that cheese for the green leaves, never catch me sleep
Steady on the grind, get mine, stand down for my crime, and I hit up the nine-nine
Gotta keep that bankroll, makin' me sale, twenties, nickles and dimes
Hit up and stick up a lick up, that 211
Gotta get what's mine, then bailin'
Me kickin' up dust, I'm a trailin', feelin' 187
That's how it is, and I gots to have it in the nine quad
Mission to check a mil and still be real, thuggin' on the glock, glock
Creeping on a come up
Won't sleep til I'm done up
Gotta blaze me blunt up
Hunt up another plot and scheme, gotta make some green, cause soldiers nut up
What up
Gotta get that buisness on, even though the buddah run me
Stunned, me feelin' lovely, but I'm just in it for the love of the money

Repeat Hook

[Verse 2: Eazy-E]
Standin' on the corner, straight slangin' rocks
Aw, man, here comes the crooked ass cops
So I dash, I ducks
And I hides behind a tree
Makin' sure the popos don't see me
Now my fat sack of rocks, hell yeah, I stuffed 'em 
Police on my drawers, I had to pause
And yeah
I still don't trust 'em
Now my game is tight
Tight as hell is my game
Eazy-E, CPT, or Eric Wright, it's all the same 
Now those might trip, on how I stacks my grip
I got to have it, yeah

Repeat Hook Twice

(Verse 3)
[Bizzy Bone]
Been down in the thugster, thuggish ways
Down for my crime, everytime, follow me down
The nine-nine, and you will find, all of me kind
Check out the Ripsta
Now, drop down, run 'em up outta me hood
Rip's, straight when I makin' me grip
With a me clique
Rollin' with Ruthless, the thug I be
Me, put 'em in mud, buck 'em, me pump up, for the love of money
With nothin' to lose, rollin' with trues, rollin' with Thug
It's goin' down
Steady pump and peel rounds, runnin' a with a me gang
Bang, gotta make that money, mayne, it's still the same, steady runnin' thangs wild
Then follow me now
While I take you up into the dark side of me run
See
For the dub, you're done, for the bud, I run, for the love of my money

[Krayzie Bone]
Gotta be down for my thang
Up in this thug game, so peep as me creep and me crawlin' off
On a mission to back in the days, Krayzie was bailin' with thugs that wanna get payed
Runnin' to me side, little thugster Ripsta, both on the mission for money
You give up the cash, now drop it, don't fast, cause me and my partner was hungry
And if you was stallin', you might get to go to the temple in dumb
Bone raw doggin'
Just make this lick as simple and run
To hell, we send ya
Me fill 'em with bang, then dump 'em in rivers
Remember, me peel ya now
From under, me dig ya
So deep in the ditch and get richer, cause trick you was steppin', I'll get ya
And rip up, so bucked up now
Steady robbin' and stealin', makin' a killin', get a thug deal and needed a million
Makin' me money where the thugs be chillin'
For the money these fools be set in Cleveland
Where you find me thuggin' off in the braids and skullies
And when I stick 'em, lick 'em, remember I get 'em for the love of money

[Satasha Williams]
