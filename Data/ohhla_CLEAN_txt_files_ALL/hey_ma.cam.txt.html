Hey ma (whassup?) Let's slide (all right)
All right - and we gon' get it on tonight
You smoke? (I smoke) I drink (me too)
Well good - cause we gon' get high tonight
Got drops (got coups) got trucks (got jeeps)
All right - cause we gon' take a ride tonight
So ma (whassup?) Let's slide (all right)
All right - and we gon' get it on tonight

[Juelz Santana]
Yo, now I was downtown clubbin, ladies night
Seen shorty she was crazy right
And I approach baby like, "Ma, what's your age and type?"
She looked at me and said, "Youse a baby right?"
I told her, "I'm 18 and live a crazy life
Plus I'll tell you what the 80's like
And I know what ladies like
Need a man that's polite, listens and takes advice
I could be all three, plus I can lay the pipe
Come with me, come stay the night"
She looked at me laughin; like boy your game is tight
I'm laughin back like sho' you right - get in the car
And don't touch nuttin, sit in the car
Let's discuss somethin - either we lovin or I'll see you tommorow
Now we speedin up the Westside
Hand creepin up her left side, I'm ready to do it
Ready to bone, ready for dome
55th exit, damn, damn, already we home
Now let's get it on

[Chorus]

[Cam'Ron]
Now that I got a girl, my ex wanna holla and spit
Told me to acknowledge her quick
She like Cam stop frontin, on that Dave Hollister Tip
Come over let's swallow and sip, I'm like momma is sick
I promise you dick, usually have a problem with chicks
(Why?) They all say I'm rotten and rich
But not her, booby's real, high heel dooby feel
Plus got them Gucci nails, uh
You a cutie still (still)
And this my down girl too, ain't no groupie deal
We left the movies with uzis, Suzuki wheels
To the jacuzzi, I tell you my booby's real
I mean she do be winnin, looey spinnin
Go to the crib she got the Gucci linen
I see booby grinnin
She looked and said, "Cam, I know that you be sinnin"
Naw, I'm a changed man, look at the range ma'am
(Look) I got a whole new game plan
Looked and said, "That's nuttin but game Cam"
She was right; she was up in the Range man (she know me)
Dropped her off at the L, now I'm flippin the cell
That's right, I had to call up L

[Cam] + (Juelz)
Yo L (whattup?) I hit (what else)
Plus dome (say word) and we got it on tonight
