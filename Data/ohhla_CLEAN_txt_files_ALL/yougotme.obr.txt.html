[Marty James]
You got me (Got me...)
No need to wonder why (Why...)
Don't have to question (Question...)
So clear your worry mind (Mind...)

[Verse 1: Marty James]
Now I don't wanna
Lose you
But I'm tryin' to do what I gotta
Do too
I know the style of my life might
Confuse you
And I don't blame you one bit (Bit)
I don't even say nothin' when you trip (Trip)
But I thought
I told you
You can put it on my shoulders
I can hold you
And I don't care who all believes me
I'm a show you
Mama, it's been a long time (Time)
I 'lieve baby boy's about to shine
I been on my grind
Gotta get this money while the door's just a little crack (Crack...)
I'm a kick it in and make some noise, baby, I'll be back (Back...)
Gotta keep it movin', ma
That's how we do it, ma
We chasin' dreams and makin' wishes, I'm a shooting star (Star...)

Hook: Marty James
Now I don't really wanna leave you right now
And I don't even really wanna go (Go...)
And I don't even wanna see you cry now
Baby, you should already know
So

Chorus: Marty James (MDA)
You got me... (You know that you got me)
No need to wonder why... (No reason to wonder why)
Don't have to question... (You ain't gotta question)
So clear your worry mind (I'm gonna make it all right)
You got me... (You know that you got me)
No need to wonder why... (No reason to wonder why)
Don't have to question... (You ain't gotta question)
So clear your worry mind

[Marty James]
I'm gonna make it all right

[Verse 2: Z-Man]
No need for second guess, yes
I know I'm runnin' late, but I be right there in a sec
No stress, no disrespect, I put my neck up there for us
See, you could see you and me got that unity and trust, plus
I know you see opportunity knockin'
Lately, it's been poppin' for me
We gon' solve these problems
Ain't
We been through
Heavier
Wearier weather, clearly, whatever get
Between us
We always seem to put it back together
Like that
No need to snap, my love, your boy is comin' back
We're scratchin' and scratch for your back
Now, girl, relax
And put it on the table, get it all off your chest
Believe me when I tell you, I'm a give you my best

Repeat Chorus

Bridge: Marty James
We can fly away
And start another life somehow
I love you everyday
I never ever let you down
Yeah
I know that it hasn't been easy
But I need you more than ever to believe me (Me...)
I'm a make it good (Good...)
I'm a set it straight (Straight...)
We gon' get it right (Right...)
So trust when I say

Repeat Chorus

[Marty James] I'm gonna make it alright

[Marty James] I told you (I told you...)
              So clear your worry mind (I'm gonna make it alright)
[MDA]         You know that you got me (Got me...)
[Marty James] I told you (I told you...)
