[x2]
Just an inner-city-native-son
Never learned to wait, taught to take it and run
Some of us raised by the way of the gun
All the drama we see makes us numb

[Verse 1]
You can tell he's seen alot for only 13
His wide eyes victimized, bite is a sting
Never told his ancestors used to be kings
Left to build himself outta what he can see
That means stick-ball, basketball, hide and seek
Fistfights, shoot-outs, and crack fiends
The single mother had to work 60 hours a week
Cleanin' offices, just so she can make ends meet
And put clothes on his back and buy food to eat
She spent time with him right before she went to sleep
But over time he learned to lust for material things
His only babysitter was the TV screen
He was force fed pop culture, watchin' in silence
Talk shows, curse words, sex and violence
Used to coming home to an empty house
Fallin' asleep waiting up for his mother on the couch

[x2]
Just an inner-city-native-son
Never learned to wait, taught to take it and run
Some of us raised by the way of the gun
All the drama we see makes us numb

He used to kick it with some other kids from down the block
All of them was broke, one of them had a plot
Said he was sick of being broke, sittin around and chillin'
And that he had a surefire way of makin' a killin'
Said that he steals old computers out of old buildins
He already had a pawn shop to deal wit 'em
Plus a man working security would open the door
For 25 percent of all the money they saw
If he was down to make some money they could roll with him
He promised he would have him back at home by 10
The kid looks at his pocket then he looks at his kicks
Looked up at his man and said "That plan sound sick"
They all agreed to meet at 8PM the next day
His boy that was 16 would drive getaway
9 o'clock sharp, they pulled up at the place
Wearing all black with a stocking cap on his face

[x2]
Just an inner-city-native-son
Never learned to wait, taught to take it and run
Some of us raised by the way of the gun
All the drama we see makes us numb

While they were snatching all the valuables right off of the desk
Loading 'em down into the van without breaking a sweat
A couple guys started feelin' overconfident
Vandalizing other offices and making a mess
They wasn't scared cause they knew they still had 10 minutes
While security changed shit and finished
But before time was up, it seemed something went wrong
They smelled smoke and heard the sound of the fire alarm
They got scared, and since they didn't want to get discovered
The guys ran for the stairs as the smoke covered
But in the stairwell they ran into a bunch of others
Who was working in the building also running for cover
They saw maintenance, house-cleaners and night-shift workers
And in the chaos he got seperated from the others
Pushing through he bumped into a old lady, knocked her over
When he looked into her eyes..
It was his mother</pre>
