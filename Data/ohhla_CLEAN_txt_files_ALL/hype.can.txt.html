Chorus: Jenny Fujita

The hype.. nitis.. is in.. your eyes
That look.. that smile.. in disguise {echoes}

[Canibus]
Aiyyo, can you feel it?
I know that everybody's heard of that (The Vapors!)
But this is the ninety-eight version of that
BizMark, one of the founders of this art
Discovered evidence, of the disease, and documented it
Now the name of the virus is called "Hype-nitis"
A terminal condition that effects all biters and liars
Hype-no-holics can't require my respect
Cause they snakes and I can smell the venom on they breath
Hype-nitis

Chorus

[Canibus]
Alright now, I'm about to break the hype-nitis down
It's characterized by a certain type of lifestyle
People that treated you foul just wanna be nice now
Smile and raise they eyebrows when you come around
I remember when I first started to work
and tried to get this job as a label intern
Them niggaz was, killin me, cause wasn't nobody feelin me
A&amp;R's wouldn't even risk demo-dealin me

{speaking over chorus}
Can you believe that shit?  That's how it was back then

Chorus

[Canibus]
Aiyyo, I know 
most the niggaz I exchange pounds with or lounge with 
wouldn't be around if my career was spiralin downward
They'd crowd around me til I'm surrounded
Ask me who I'm down with, til I replied, "The Navy Seals outfit"
They told me my album was coconuts so they rewound it
I knew they was hype-no-holics by how they voices sounded
I pull a silver can out of my trousers
Made a public announcement, about the Hype juice 
and then I bounced kid {echoes}

Chorus

[Canibus]
To me hype-nitis is like the measles, cause it's a disease too
Studies show it affects one in every five people
It's so lethal, the cure can't be achieved through
hypodermic needles or the ingestion of medicine in teaspoons
If you feel the need to, here's a toll-free number
They'll send you an eight page pamphlet to read through
(800)-7932 , there'll be available hype-no-holics 
standin by for you to speak to {echoes}

Chorus

[Jenny Fujita]
The hype..</pre>
