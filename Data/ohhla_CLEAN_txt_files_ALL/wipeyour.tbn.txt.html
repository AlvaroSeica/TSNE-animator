[T-Bone]
I know the world got you down
bound by the problems and troubles of life
Full of strife pain and misery 
lookin for true peace love and happiness 
that you can't find in a drugs 
sex or hennessey but come along wit me 
if ya wanna hear bout the one that healed the sick 
and made the blind see 
the one that turned water into wine 
and multiplied the loaves and the fishes 
healed the lady wit the issue of blood and cured leprosy 
cuz even when your friends aint there 
and you feelin like nobody cares
God's still there ready to cast all your burdens away 
let Him in your heart this very day and I pray 
that every lyric I spit will penetrate the very depths of your soul 
and I'm gonna let the whole world know 
He can make your sins white as snow 
now let me bust en espanol, para mexicano, o cubano 
panameno, colombiano, argentino, chilleno 
nico, ya puerto ricano, lo que to te enseno 
es algo que me ensenaron de pequeno
wit this instrumental I'm gonna make you get sentimental 
cause I be knowin that your feelin what I'm talkin bout 
make ya wanna shout shout, let it all out out 
like tears for fears, I'm tryin to reach my peers 
and the thugs playas in the clubs and my patnas slangin drugs
duckin em slugs lookin for love 
in a messed up world thats cold like a freezer
thats why until the day I die I'm gonna preach 
the Word of God like the man of God they call Peter 
mira ahorita you might be goin through 
a thing or two but know that Jesus still loves you 
so its all good playa wipe your eyes 
Cuz Jesus said that everything is gonna be alright 
now come on down
 
[Chorus]
Problems, troubles trials and storms will come your way 
Jesus offers love and wants to wipe yours tears away
Cuz even when it seems like nobody really cares, Jesus is there
and he hears your prayers and he hears your prayers
 
[Bridge]
don't cry the Lord replies 
I wanna wipe the tears from your lonely eyes 
its gonna be alright
tonight you might be goin throught some things 
but joy comes in the mornin time 
and I pray that through this rhyme 
I'm touchin your mind 
body and soul let Him take control 
and I know that if you trust in God, 
leave your problems in his hands 
then everythings gonna be alright
 
[T-Bone]
Your cryin in the night cause you're lonely
Prayin to the Lord above please hold me
Somebody told me 
that when I'm feelin broken hearted, sad and lost in the valley 
you're the one to console me
slowly ease the pain that I be feelin deep 
within free me from the life of sin cuz I'm tired of all the bangin 
drug slangin and playin wit the girls smokin weed and sippin on the gin 
I need a real friend who wont leave me nor forsake me 
even if the whole world hates me who makes me 
feel like I'm somebody special for once in my life 
when all my foes wanna lie and playa hate me, 
I seen so much drama throughout my life 
so many of my peers died and I wonder why 
I never got to say goodbye look to the sky 
and pray that the Lord hear my cry 
they say that You can set me free take away this pain 
and misery and deliver me from the hands of the enemy 
all because of the blood that You shed at calvary 
You gave me the gift of eternal life and now I finally see 
that You're the answer to all my needs so I'm down on my knees 
beggin Lord please forgive me 
from this day forward I promise 
to follow where ever you lead 
wipe my tears Lord
 
[Chorus]</pre>
