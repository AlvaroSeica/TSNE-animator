[Intro: Armel]
B.K. to U.K. (U.K.) U.K. to B.K.

"I bust this..." -&gt; 60 Second Assassin

[Chorus: Spanky Splash]
Every time we hit the track we hit it like (ahhh!!!)
Every time we flow we flow like (ahhh!!!)
Every time we smoke we smoke like (ahhh!!!)
Every time the (ahhh!!!) Every time the (ahhh!!!)

"I bust this..." -&gt; 60 Second Assassin

[Armel]
Yo, you can press me like the government
60 Sec., get my sex on before the next song
I like you, going hype for you, we invite you
Adrift from Earth, now a landed Mooncycle
Here's space boost, use a solar Coins for loot
There's a city on the Moon that still play rap tunes
Sell poon on the internet, no more WIC check
The re-up outside the drug store, the entrepenuers
Everything is legal now except the hip hop sound
Twenty g's a ticket, it's my supplies, missed it?
Came with dead-ass swords to the galaxian wars
Space shuttle, one accord, back to Earth before I'm bored
Before I go, you move, black thought leave you curious
People in the future took the math dead serious

[Makeba Mooncycle]
You may rain like an eagle, I come down like a dove
Snatch ya soul like a raven then bring it back to love
Never called that bitch cuz I remain righteous
Let off steam through my windpipe to seize 'em plus I still write
Like with the Coins in the lunar eclipse
Took a ride on the starship, then we flip
Saw MC's in the Milky Way taking a bath
Jump aboard the Sunship, still doing the math
Keep Coins by my side, cuz United my Kingdom
Revolution is over and acknowledge my freedom
The new holy renegade, my lyrics cut like old blades
Riding on shooting stars, politicking with the Gods
The holy land to the stars, vacations on Mars
The battle has been won, from the Moon to the Sun

[Chorus]

[Holy Smokes]
Watching ya ways and actions, ya terror and error
Suffering in failure, cease in being clever
Other sessions got drama, bringing their weapons
I know this condition, run up for his manhood, a deadman tradition
Got ears and don't listen, too much exagerrating
Deep thoughts like a convict, escaping
Things on my tongue erasing, watch who ya facing
Hold ya grudge I won't budge ("I bust this..." -&gt; 60 Sec.)
Actually I feel for you cousin, I mean that, one love
I take my place of scheme, I'm talking to all these thugs
Salute, come to shoot, oops, my narrow arrow shoots
Bullseye, bye bye to the dirty heater
The Holy Smokes'll seize that and leave it depleted

[Chorus]

"I bust this..." -&gt; 60 Second Assassin

[Chorus 2X]

[Outro: Armel (female singer) {Makeba Mooncycle} w/ 60 sample repeating also]
On the hook, Spanky Splash (Every time we flow, oh, oh)
Armel, the Ill Fanatic (I said, every time we flow, oh, oh)
Holy Smokes, yeah, Snuggle-Up, Coins, Mooncycle (Every time we flow, oh, oh)
{To the Sun, Father Lord, D. Kruger} (I said, every time we flow, oh, oh)
{And to my Family that's Royal, here's a Rose} (Every time we flow, oh, oh)
{See you at noon, B.K., peace} (I said, Every time we flow, oh, oh)
Yo, yo, yo, yo (Every time we flow, oh, oh, I said, every time we flow, oh, oh)

[Hook: Makeba Mooncycle (Holy Smokes)]
Every time we flow (the cycle rotates)
Every time we flow (the cycle rotates)

[Outro II: Holy Smokes (Spanky Splash)]
C.O.I.N.S. (a full crescent moon) Another manhunt for the cycle
Flipsta, black thought, You'll Move</pre>
