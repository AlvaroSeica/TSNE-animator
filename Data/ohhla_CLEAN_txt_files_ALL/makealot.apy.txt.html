Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Intro/Chorus: samples of Joni Mitchell]
I'm gonna make a lotta money, then I'm gonna quit this cra-crazy scene
I'm gonna make a lotta money, then I'm gonna quit this cra-crazy scene

[Apathy]
I'ma make a lot of friends and I'ma make a lot of foes
I'ma make a lot of songs and I'ma make a lot of dough
I'ma make a lot of kids angry when I let 'em know
that I'ma quit rappin if they don't support it anymo'
They ain't buyin records but they comin to my shows
Cause they can't download a performance or buy clothes
You sucker motherfucker, I hope you decompose
Hope somebody make you work for free then see how it goes
I'ma make a lot of paper then quit this crazy scene
Used to read articles in The Source magazine
No matter what, nothin ever fucked with my dream
'til I had to grow up and then it fucked with my cream
All that glitters not gold it would seem
I got props from Rakim, got props from Preem
But props don't pay my bills or fill stomachs
So either I'ma make some money or say fuck it

[Chorus]

[Apathy]
Shout out to them deejays who used to carry mad heavy crates
Rocked parties, paid dues and became heavyweights
Then along came these vultures not half as nice
But they got Serato and charged clubs half the price
Fuckin up the dude who spent half his life
studyin the techniques and made the sacrifice
Then celebrities get paid to play their iPod
Soundin like a trainwreck (oh my God~!)
I'm a student like a mutant at Xavier schools
Did my homework, paid dues, obeyed the rules
So I'ma make a lot of money cause it's never guaranteed
It's not about greed, it's just tryin to succeed
I live, eat, sleep, breathe and bleed
tap shit, that's it, it's really all I need
I just wanna pay bills, maybe have a couple seeds
Get money, green, cheddar, cream, paper, dough, cheese

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

[Outro]
I'm gonna make a lot of money
then I'm gonna quit this crazy scene
I wish I had (MONEY!!!)</pre>
