[Timbo King]
You don't want that toast come out
Niggas dead, when the muthafucking post come out
Ratchets blow, Bo King, Bo Keys
I got bitches on both knees, braining me off, feel me?
Corporate thugs, gun in the block, we gun shit
Yeah, a gangsta, don't let me shank ya
Spit shells right here, smoke L's right here
Get glocked my nigga, that bell right here
Now we clubbing, thugging ya'll laming nights
I walk through any hood with the stainless pipes
You know the getchas, album cover, mugshot pictures
Pissy off the Hypnotiq, you know that blue water
Bo King be that new order
So fuck ya'll, million dollar bucks ya'll
Walk through the hood and won't get stuck ya'll
Bottle of bub, drinking, Kojak, still slinging
Cracker jacks, red tops, my bed rock
All night long, I'm fucking bitches offa All Night Long
Mary Blige song, a bottle half gone, I'm the don, real talk

[Chorus: Timbo King]
Where them G's at? Where them trees at?
Where them niggas with them big body v's at?
Best believe that, a bitch need that
Matter fact, we gon' run this place

[Timbo King]
Go 'head and flip it, and get ya whole team evaporated
Bitches on my dick, hoes be infactuated
The Don King, I promote the violence
Yeah, from Fort Green, PJ's to Vanderveer
My whole Fam's in here, drinkin' on Belvedere
With ice on, that's bright as the chandeleer
Yea I'm used to, hangin' with boosters
Them cluck chickenhead bitches who fuck with roosters
We bang bang, who cares what set you claim?
Brooklyn be the borough, I rep the name
So forget the fame, yeah I spit the flames
We want the money and the guns, the rest is lames
For the skrilla my killas will lay you down
We don't play around when we spray around
That Mac-1-1, get back son-son
This ain't Kim and Em', this is Timb and 'em
And I ain't talkin' 'bout motherfuckin' Timbaland
And I ain't talkin' 'bout motherfuckin' Timbaland

[Outro: Timbo King]
It's Timbo King, Bo King
