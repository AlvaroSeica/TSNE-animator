Ball
I done two wayed you two or three times
now you need to call me back now
you know it's your sons birthday tomorrow
you need to call me
I'm getting pissed off.

(Chorus:)
Daddy, why you gone so long?
Daddy, when will you come back home?
Daddy, don't get your ??? alone
Daddy, when will you come back home?

(Eightball:)
Running though the airport
my lil shorty birthday and I ain't there for it
another show I gotta get it how it come to me
even though I wanna see my baby run to me smiling
reaching up, so I can pick him up
it's not enough that I can send money and buy his stuff
I wanna see him blow the candles out on the cake
be there to correct you when you make mistakes.
It's only so much ya momma can do for you
even though she do so much for you
only a man can teach you how to be a man
teach you not to be a fool in this foolish land.
Listen to ya momma
go to school don't trip
learn everything
being smart, that's hip.
Little man be strong hold the house down
and I'm goin be there to see you when I touch down, yeah.

(Chorus:)
Daddy, why you gone so long?
Daddy, when will you come back home?
Daddy, don't get your ??? alone
Daddy, when will you come back home?

(MJG: )
Baby I think about you all the time
throughout every show and every line
hope you and ya momma doing fine
I luv ya'll.
They had a fight at the club last night
don't worry
I'm straight
you can still hug dad tight
When I get home from off the road
you take this load off me
sweetheart tell ya momma to make me some coffee
Daddy's princess
Daddy's little gyrl
learning things daily in yo own little world.
I'm goin continue doing what I doing
to provide for ya
close ya eye's now, daddy's gotta surprise for ya
I'll ride for ya till I'm old grey and tired for ya
so when I'm gone,  you'll understand I tried for ya.
It's important for a gyrl to know her father
so I can be the man you run to, when times get harder
I'm coming home
cause home is where the heart is
I'm worn out but still, I'll be there regardless.

(Chorus:)
Daddy, why you gone so long?
Daddy, when will you come back home?
Daddy, don't get your ??? alone
Daddy, when will you come back home?

(Eightball:)
This is for the
cats who hustle all day and night
in the streets doing what's wrong or what's right
you see ya babies when you can
don't ya know ya lil babies need to see you man
if you don't teach them
then they gonna learn the wrong way
so sit down and listen what they got to say.
And you boys in the club every weekend
straight ballin' but you can't take care of ya kids.
When they grow it's to late to try to make it up
you never know when god plan on taking us.
So much evil in the world and it's all new
to a child who ain't been through what you been through
a kid can't play in the streets without dodging bullets
and nine times outta ten
a kid probably pulled it
cause they momma
and daddy weren't there for em
so it's important that we let em know we care for em, yeah.

(Chorus:)
Daddy, why you gone so long?
Daddy, when will you come back home?
Daddy, don't get yo ??? alone
Daddy, when will you come back home?

(Bridge:)
Daddy, Daddy
I really miss my daddy
Daddy, Daddy
I really miss my daddy
Daddy, Daddy
I really miss my daddy
Daddy, Daddy
I really miss my daddy.
