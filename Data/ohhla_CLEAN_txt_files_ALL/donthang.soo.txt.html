Intro:
*Scratchin*
Yes yes y'all (x8)

[Verse 1]
Ruff rugged tha incredible one,Soopafly come wit tha bomb
A pound to brake a muthafucka down
Surrounded,by subliminal thoughts to keep me criminal minded
You'll find its hard fuckin wit a dog that'll scar 
Your whole mind body soul approach 
Devastated,elevated your shit never made it
However can one dare to compare a style rare from ground,to air above
Showin no love,now it's tha pimpin flow
Interests show,that you aint hittin no mo
Your shit's gettin old,forget tha past
Dont let tha past pave a way to tha world
occupied by MCs that I slay
Affect tha first when I select a verse
To hit you with tha worse intention
Blast in three dimension,sharp like a ginzu
Then you will understand that I split niggas to fragments of a man
Differental from pots to pans,opposition at a glance
I rate,and takin chances quick to brake like branches
Im like a banchy on a midnight get right or get even
You're Wondering like Steven running from day light to evening
Time,cos I bust shots to injure 
I stay black and smooth like a ninja
It's Soopafly quick to throw them thangs 
I get tha money and rings,muthafuckaz cant hang cos

[Hook]
I dont hang with no bustas
I dont hang with no fags
I dont hang with no connivin ass niggas who aint out
there makin cash
Sho nuff dont hang with no snitches
Sho nuff dont fuck with no bitches
I'm only out for my riches
So muthafuckaz stay tha fuck out my buisness

*Scratchin*
"Feel tha beat"
"I gots to have it"(x3)

[Verse 2]
I'm unexplanatory like Rogaine
What's your name was mine?
Soopafly game do or die
Death becomes those who oppose and run up
Muthafuckaz get done up,on a one two come up (come up)
Evidently you've been bitin for years
All skills to adapt to (nigga I'll pimp slap you)
My rhyme trap you,attractin bitches and hoes
Then developin tha 51 flows
I suppose,I got you runnin like your nose
Like threat,shot,to my niggas that cant get wet
Betcha,I spoke a lecture
I let cha think everythin's fine
Then react inna blinks time
Over-done,Im rated number one contender
Tha war zone engage or surrender
Now if tha kicks fit nigga wear that shit
Give me a stage and microphone Im bound to tear that shit
Tha fuck up,now what cha gon do?
Take a seat,or step to my mystic well then pack tha concrete
Now how you gonna act? I'll lay your ass flat
It's Soopafly comin with tha shit like that (like that like that)

"I gots to have it,cos I want it,and I need it" (x2)

[Verse 3]
Now only I control thee unfold thee 
Uncut and uncensored floatin ?vinta?,it's ah 
Sort of like a mixture,can you picture
One calm and cool one that burn like the sun
The one two two to three
Soopafly rolls freely (freely)
High to the sky,muthafuckas cant see me (see me) 
Im skulls like a beanie (beanie)
I'm disappearin like a genie (genie)
Intoxicated off tha Remy (Remy)
Martin Im startin to box up fools by tha carton
It's tha one,incredible fly
I fly by day,droppin bombs on thee E.P. 
With Dat Nigga Daz still representin' D.P.

[Hook]
Now I dont hang with no bustas
And I dont hang with no fags
And I dont hang with no connivin ass niggas who aint
out there makin cash
Sho nuff dont hang with no snitches
Sho nuff dont fuck with no bitches
I'm only out for my riches
So muthafuckaz stay tha fuck out my buisness

Waitin baitin for my ass to flip flop but I dont flop
(flop flop) (x4)
No I don't</pre>
