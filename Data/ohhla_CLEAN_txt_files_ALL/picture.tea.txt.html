[Intro: Islord]
Who the, who the, yo, who the, yo, who the, yo

[Chorus 2X: Islord]
Who the fuck said we fell off, picture that
Everytime we come, kid, we come correct
And still on the run up, on your set, swift techs
Cuz niggas is some real fucking vets

[Islord]
Let me ask ya'll niggas a question
What the fuck was ya'll niggas thinking
Going up against me, kid?
Don't you know, kid, I put end to careers, do, kid
So who gassed ya'll, who put batteries in ya'll backs
For ya'll to step up to get viciously attacked
By this animal, who tears the heart, challenge challengers everyday
Everywhere I go, everywhere I be, I tear the hearts out of challengers, kid
And you definetly, ain't no different, who the fuck is you?
I put one, two, three, four, five, six, clips, them slugs in ya muthafucking crew
Bitch ass nigga, get slapped nigga
Going against my muthafucking style, nigga
Cuz I'm straight from Staten Island
Where niggas be wilding, Killah Hill 10304
Where shit is crazy raw, like the meat market
I hang niggas up like targets
Then put four-five slugs in they hearts, kid

[Dom Pachino]
Fuck it, dump the whole clip, then sink they whole ship
Don't even feel the pain, when they fucking with this
Misfits, pull out some grenades and start launching and shit
These weapons ain't silent, they noisy and shit
These little faggot ass bitch niggas
Say the name Killarm', and see a ditch, niggas
Ya'll in trouble, you are fucking with a rich nigga
I'm waiting for the paper, work to go through
The whole'll Team be mobile
If we see you round the hood, we gon' show you
Don't let that mouth, sign checks, that the ass can't cash
Keep the heat in the stash, if he drive, don't keep the heat in the dash
Kid, keep it on you, little faggots dissin' Dom P., the street done warned you
You are fucking with some bredren man, nobody knows you
You reap what you sow, nigga, and you will be seen

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
