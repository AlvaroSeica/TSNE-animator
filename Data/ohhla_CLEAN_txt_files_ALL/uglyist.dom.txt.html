[Intro: Dom Pachino]
Excuse me? Yeah, this is mine right here, thanks

[Dom Pachino]
Ever seen a pretty nigga wit the uglyist flow
Sellin ki's by the quarter, same color as snow
Wreckless on the beach, wreckless on the streets, wreckless wit the heat
But so cool, refrigerated off big jewels
I'm Power Rule, devour crews wit my canines
Digest 'em for tryin to play mine, like it's playtime
Did I say, I'm militant from the Timb to the top of my brim
Short and trim, but the kid got a chin
Who match the most, who the all time best?
I don't know, but I put my shit to the test
If you act up, I put this shit through ya chest
Get smacked up, your bitches say I was the best
Metal in big pocket business, his crib so big
That you can fit a prison in it
Shit ain't new, when you thought this shit was invented?
Shit is truth, faster than your mind can comprehend it
Living proof, I'm that nigga in a booth
Got a bag full of goodies for ya sweet ass tooth
Doorag and hoodie? Was a mean ass youth
Ski mask and toolie, can it be that's you?
Just keep it on the hush, can you be that smooth?
Don't get caught up in the rush, and be that dude
That identified me, machine gun tattoos
On my forearm, war is on, need that to

[Chorus: Dom Pachino]
You know the team, we bust them things
And when we come through wit them tanks, we blow off steam
The team's supreme, we shine and gleam
So victorious, and we always do our thing

[Dom Pachino]
Yo, you know the team without the A, dash, powerful
Knock niggas out, way out my weight class, honorable
Personal arsenal, strapped to the abdominal, I move calm &amp; cool
Niggas is comical, I bomb atomical
Under dirt like the casket, these black mask cats is back at it
New year, new cabbag, new gadgets to reign havoc
New vision wit new graphics, precision, that's fantastic
My flow's classic, cut glass like black diamonds
Voice sharp as fuck when I'm rhyming
Good look wit good timing, more dough means more dining
More flows I'm on fire, more shows, I'm getting higher
Than I ever been, on a plateau of a veteran, now that's irrelevant
Beats hard like cement when it settle in
And you in my business meddling, you see the metal, then

[Chorus]

[Interlude; Dom Pachino]
We do our thing regardless, of the consequence
Youknowhatimean, as long as we keep it militant
And strap our boots up tight, man, it's gon' be alright
Knowhatimsaying, I asked ya'll a question before
You feel my energy? Yo, you feel my energy
I asked you before, I said, yo

[Dom Pachino]
Who max the most, who the all time best?
I don't know, but I put my shit through the test
If you act up, I put this shit through your chest
Bitch smacked up, your bitches say I was the best
Metal in big pocket business, his crib so big
That you could fit a prison in it
Shit ain't new, when you thought this shit was invented
Shit is truth, faster than your mind can comprehend it
Living proof, I'm that nigga in a booth
Got a bag full of goodies for ya sweet ass tooth
Doorag and hoodie? Was a mean ass youth
Ski mask and toolie, can it be that's you?
Just keep it on the hush, can you be that smooth?
Don't get caught up in the rush, and be that dude
That identified me, machine gun tattoos
On my forearm, war is on, need that to

[Outro: Dom Pachino]
Hahaha, spit in ya fucking face
This my album right here, Power Rulez, nigga
P.R. Terrorist invention</pre>
