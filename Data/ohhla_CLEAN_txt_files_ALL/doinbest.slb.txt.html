[Chorus - Shyna]
The hard thing is we maintainin
but yeah we face it - we doin this the best we can
The hard thing is we maintainin
but yeah we face it - we doin this the best we can

[Verse 1 - Trae]
Just realize my pain don't under estimate the life that I live
cause everything ain't what it seem dogg I promise it's real
too many troubles in the world be steadily ridin my back
my attitude be off track and plus I like it like that
cause I wouldn't have to be bothered with all these fake ass, roach ass, bitch ass
who only know me for cash - it's like these niggas only see the finer things that I have
but they don't see the rainy days and hard nights that I grab
or better yet about the fact that my child was born sick
momma stressin and everyday bills be gettin thick
I'm real in the game and been representin for over ten
now it's 2004 and I still ain't able to win
I ain't whinin I'm a take it how it go
and mash the gas to the bullets for me and my nigga Ro
Slow Loud when I Bang forever to let 'em know
that the life I live is hard even if it don't show...Fuh Real

[Chorus - Shyna]
The hard thing is we maintainin
but yeah we face it - we doin this the best we can
The hard thing is we maintainin
but yeah we face it - we doin this the best we can

[Verse 2 - Lil'B]
I really love how my team hit the scene lookin clean
spinnin and drivin crazy that's a young man's dream
just let 'em know that these ain't always what it seems
we come home to plenty bills know what I mean
if it ain't the car note - it's the house
if it ain't a phone call - the mail man on the route
it it ain't ya right hand man with his hand out
it's the baby momma with the drama stressin niggas out
and they wonder why the dro blow slow still hit it
cold fo' po yo homies wanna sip it, don't go no no homies wanna kick it
and ya'll wonder why a young nigga be trippen
it's a shame but I maintain and keep my head right
it ain't easy believe me I'm puttin up a fight
still prayin that the Lord don't take me in the night
it ain't always what it seems when you in the lime light...Fuh Real

[Chorus - Shyna]
The hard thing is we maintainin
but yeah we face it - we doin this the best we can
The hard thing is we maintainin
but yeah we face it - we doin this the best we can

[Singing - Shyna]
The best we can...we're gonna do this the best we can
the best we can, the best we can
we're gonna do this the best we can</pre>
