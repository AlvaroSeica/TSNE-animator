[Pusha T]
I'm only in the company of kings
I made a power move and it's everything it seems
Before 'Ye signed me, I was +getting out my dreams+
Standing on the shoulders of twenty-thousand fiends
Every time a nigga wanna try and turn a profit
folks rush in, three letters try and stop it
F-B-I-R-S-D-E-A
One letter short, but still motherfuck the D.A.
We play by the rules as they try to crack the code
Combination locks to the kilos that I hold
Leopard print Louboutins prowling the concrete
Rollerballs come alive just like Jumanji
You know where to find me, Greenhouse, a circle of top whores
Mandarin, Gansevoort, any of them top floors
Thirty-five large, took it right out the top draw
Still got a throwaway phone in my sock draw

[Chorus: Pharrell]
It's like raid, spraying on you roaches
The AK is an animal, it is ferocious
A nigga wanna sing, hope he is the dopest
Watch that nigga disappear, hocus pocus
Ring, ring, the nigga wanna sing
Ring, ring, I keep that bitch clean
Ring, ring, the nigga wanna sing
'Less he is an insomniac and dying to dream, huh?

[50 Cent]
Yeah, you can tell I went to school on a small yellow bus
Never bothered me, strong arm robbery
I went from powdered jelly donuts, to taking the most
From my high school sweetheart, to fucking with hoes
Look I'm all grown up, and I done blown up
Nigga ain't much changed, in fact, things are the same
I'm the definition of shooter, gun of choice the Ruger
You'll take my word for it or make me do it to ya
I'm a magnet to murder when I'm in the mood
Get convicted through the forensics when you walk in my shoes
I'm bad news, you niggas know the verdict
I'm filthy, drop' Phantom is milky, white on white
Twenty-four inch blades, I'm skating, red eye
Smoking that bomb shit, I'm Satan, nigga, surprise
50 back on fire
50 back running round this bitch strapped, hitman for hire

[Chorus]

[Pusha T]
I sit with the liars, duct tape and tires
Been lost their soul, they just waiting on the fire
Innocent faces with a shitload of priors
Something out of nothing, a team full of MacGyvers 
Deep-sea dive for the fishscale
Tryna find a better price, man that ship sailed
Take a breath and head back if that shit fail
Drop weight like an anchor then you set sail
Hell freeze over like the watch I put the sleeve over
Engine double scream when I turn the key over
Pirellis on the street rolling like a steam roller
Bitches double team when I have my sleepovers
Eghck, Re-Up Gang with the G-Unit
This is tailor-made drug dealer, fiend music
Test it on ya tongue or either watch a fiend do it
I got you hooked and I laugh as you lean to it

[Chorus]</pre>
