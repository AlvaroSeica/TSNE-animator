[Intro/Chorus]
Bumm boom boom boom, bum bum bum
Bumm boom boom boom, bum bum bum bum
You do, don't you though, you do you do though, don't you?
Yeah, you do
You do, don't you though, you do you do though, don't you?
Yeah, you do

[Verse One: George Clinton]
So you wanna be me, don't you know, don't you know
You're never gonna be me
You better watch where you when you walk in my footsteps
Step into what you're gonna
Never an unkept step
You wanna keep up with can't be kept up with
You wanna be up on me, clone me
Not a chance
Clone me, don't play that
Don't even say that
Must be some other way that
You can be you
And I don't have to dis or down another
A brother ain't heavy like a light is a beer
Or a match which you ain't for me
Although you wanna be, you never ever gonna be me

[Chorus]
You do, you do, don't, don't you, yeah you do, you do 
You do, don't you do, you do, you do, don't, don't you
Yeah you do say you do 
You do, don't you do, you do, you do, don't, don't you
Yeah, you do, what?

[Verse Two: George Clinton]
So you wanna be me, don't you know, don't you know
You never gonna be me
Better watch where you when you walk in my footsteps
Step into what you gonna
Never an unkept step
You wanna keep up with what can't be kept up with
You wanna be up on me, clone me
Not a chance
Clone me, don't play that
Don't even say that
Must be some other way that
You can be you
And I don't have to dis or down another
A brother ain't heavy like a light is a beer
Or a match which you ain't for me
Although you wanna be, me

[Chorus]
You do, don't you know, you do, you do though 
Don't you do, yeah you do, you know you do
What you wanna be me?

[Hook]
I be about the ribbon trophy banner or the cup
Silver, bronze, gold medals got to give them up
I'm a winner and you wanna be me

[Chorus]
Yeah you do, don't you know, you do, you do though 
Don't you, yeah you do
Yeah you do, don't you know, you do, you do though 
Don't you, yeah you do
Yeah you do, don't you know, you do, you do though 
Don't you, yeah you do
You do, don't you know, you do, you do though 
Don't you, yeah you do, you know you do

[Hook: X2]
And the flag was still there, waving on while we dance
And the flag was still there, waving on as we dance
And the flag was still there, waving on while we dance
And the flag was still there..
Bumm boom boom boom, bum bum bum
Bumm boom boom boom, bum bum bum bum

[Male - Overvoice]
I'm on hit
You're all over me like a shepard's sheep
It's deep, they only wanna talk about one thing me
I'm the Conversation about what it be
You give up each and every single possession to keep me
This be the reason me plus the things that I say
Yeah, I got it going on, women every night and day
Yes, yes, yes, is what they wish I'd say
But you know how it goes, they just stay stuck on me
I traded my limo' and a mansion for a yacht and a condo sure
I took little Susie to the movie
And she knew just what she had in store
I trade in men's women like credit cards
Any they just want to give me more
They trade a zero like you for hero like me
Yeah, totally and for sure

[Female - Overvoice]
Yeah, cause I'm on hit
You're all over me like a shepard's sheep
It's deep, they only wanna talk about one thing me
I'm the Conversation about what it be
You give up each and every single possession to keep me
This be the reason me plus the things that I say
Yeah, I got it going on
Fellows every night and day
Yes, yes, yes, is what they wish I'd say
But you know how it goes, they just stay stuck on me

[Outro]
Oooohhhh, the flag, oooohhh the flag
Oooohhhh, the flag, oooohhh the flag
And the flag was still there, waving on while we dance
The flag is still here..
And the flag was still there, waving on while we dance
The flag is still here..</pre>
