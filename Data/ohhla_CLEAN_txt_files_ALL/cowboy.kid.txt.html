[Kid Rock]
Well I'm a' packin up my game and I'm a head out west
Where real women come equipped wit' scripts and fake breasts
find a nest in the hills chill like flynt
buy an old drop-top find a spot to pimp
Then I'm a' Kid Rock it up and down ya' block
with a bottle of scotch and watch lots a crotch
buy a yacht with a flag that say's "Chillin' the most"
then rock that bitch up and down the coast
give a toast to the sun
drink with the stars
get thrown in the mix
and get tossed outta bars
Sift to Tiajuana
I wanna rome
find motown telephones and come back home
start an escort service for all the right reasons
and set up shop at the top of four seasons
Kid Rock and I'm the Real Mccoy
and i'm headed out west sucker cuz I wanna be a

Chorus: Kid Rock

Cowboy!!Baby!
With the top let down and the sunshine shinin'
West Coast Chillin' while the boone's whinen
I wanna be a Cowboy!Baby!
Ride At night cause I sleep all day!
Cowboy!Baby/I can smell a pig from a mile away

[Kid Rock]
I bet you'll hear my whistle blowin when my train rolls in
It goes"hooy-hooy-hooy" Like dust in the wind
Stoned pimp, stoned brew, stoned out of my mind
I once was lost but now I'm just blind
Palm trees and weed
Scabbed knees and rice
get a map to the stars
find heidi flice
and if the price is right
then i'm gonna make my bid
and let Californi-A
Know why they call me

Chorus

[Kid Rock]
Yeahhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!
Kid Rock You can call me Tex
Rollin' sunset women with a bootle of becks
See a slimy in a vette Roll down my glass
And said "Yeah this dick fits right in yo ass"
No kiddin', gun slingin', spurs hittin' the floor
call me hoss,I'm the boss,with the sauce,and the horse
no remorse for the sheriff and his eye aint right
I'm a paint his town red Then I'm a' paint his wife white
Cause chaos Rock like Amedeus
Got west coast pussy for my Detroit playas
mack like mayors ball like lakers
they told us to leave but bet they couldn't make us
why they wanna pick on me
lock me up and throw away my key
I ain't no cheat I'm just a regular failure
I'm not straight out a' compton I'm straight out the trailer
cuss like a sailor Drink like a mick
my only words of wisdom are just suck my dick
I'm takin' my pick
up and down that and keep on truckin'
till' I fall in the ocean

Chorus</pre>
