This is what it sounds like...

You can drown in prescriptions
You can count your blessings or inflictions..
Choose one..I was 15 watching the sunrise
Puffing angel Dust the same day I watched my youth die
I saw my Guardian Angel cry
He said someone had clipped his wings and now he was afraid to fly
I told him "Man up and take a hit of this."
He since recanted faith and only practices indifference
The moral of that ditty is..
Ignorance in some instances is better than admitting to what your living with
And things will never be the same and that's perfect
Because the way things were, were not worth it
Everyone loves a good surface
But un-earth it
then you find out what you're working with
I'm just another sword juggler
and this is my circus
Watch an angel fall from grace..
It's certainly worth the price of purchase.
His heart remains locked in a drum kit
And the pain becomes comedy..
At least when It's told in 2nd person
Otherwise....
he's rather sick of writing lullabies
High again.. wonder why lie beneath the summer sky
Good bye

This is what it sounds like...
When there's nothing to lose
Nothing to gain
Just got the news that your muse had been slain
This is what it sounds like..

Some do it for the love others do it for the wallet
I do it because everyone loves a work in progress
Hey I'm a working artists.
Working on the starving part

This is for the folk that cut their flesh on paper
Cuz their too bitch made to do it real life
This is a real heart, part of a real life
Broadcasted to you out in real time
They used to say little Mark
Is real Sharp but i'd wish he talk
It's hard to get a read on  what he's really like
But you'd be shy too
If it at age 5 you thought patterns formed in Haikus
I tried to explain... I really tried too

This isn't for the faint of heart
This isn't for the kids who skipped out on language arts
This is for the sculptors
Who make works of art from them discarded mangled parts
Approaching every angle sharp
Tangled in dangling fate
that is revealed
Signed, sealed and
Redfeining means of escape
Rearranging scenes of the stage
It's sad tomorrows indeed
Like IV veins
and Plastic nozzle's to breathe
You can practice Gospel and creed
to disguise a deprived inside a lack of belief
In yourself
This is what we keep to ourself
And wonder why some of us keep to ourselves

Because we know what it sounds like
When there's nowhere to turn
When you forgotten what you learned
Given keys to save the world but you rather watch it burn
This is what it sounds like.
When  you kept that 

Finding out your friend is on the needle
Just trying to put an end all the evil
And he won't return the calls
Wonder why he wants to burn it down
Because all he ever hears is the 
Because he listens to the  sound...
And this is what it sounds like
when hope drowns</pre>
