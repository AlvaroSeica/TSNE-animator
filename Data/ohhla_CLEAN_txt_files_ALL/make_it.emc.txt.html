[Verse One] [Stricklin]
Ladies and gents, gather around, lets take an intermission
The industry is strung out it needs an intervention
Cam dissin' Jay they cleared Irv Gotti
Nas signed to Def Jam and Fiddy signin' everybody
And B.E.T is on some other shit
They can +Laffy Taffy+ all day but can't play Little Brother shit?
And if you buyin' it they sellin' it
No 106 for De La cause they said they not relevant
And that ain't right 
You either too soft or too thug
Bottom line?
I think the game need a group hug
Need a new Busta tattoo, a new Snoop drug
A new attitude, called Let-The-Artist-Recoup-Love
And that won't happen 
And I prolly won't sell
Cause I don't know Nate Dogg 
And I can't afford Pharrell
And Paul Wall ain't answer my call or my e-mail
I'm tryin' to make it better but I fail
Oh well

[Chorus]
We can make it better, we can make it better if we put our heads together 
We can make it better, we can make it better
We can make it better, we can make it better if we try to come together
We can make it better, we can make it better

[Verse Two] [Punchline]
I be the voice for the hood, straight aggravation
Need less welfare and more job placements
Dope chasin'
The thug life fascinatin'
Little shorties running wild like imaginations
Conversation young kids catching cases
Wrist watches should be the only time that you facin'
Hood nation 
They sell crack just for some food
Grew up with rats, I ain't talkin' about Sammy The Bull
If you got some good lawyer and some bail money
Then when you see the cop cars use your bail money
It's not funny
Swallow pride just to survive
What we strive
More baby mamas then wives
Please get at me
If you down to break the cycle
We need to reach out, touch the kids like Michael
Men rise up, young ladies wise up
Gotta get together and fight before times up

[Chorus]
We can make it better, we can make it better if we put our heads together 
We can make it better, we can make it better
We can make it better, we can make it better if we try to come together
We can make it better, we can make it better

[Verse Three] [Wordsworth]
Bombs, grenades
Raided by armed brigades
Dirt placed on Marine and Army graves
Thought it would calmly fade 
But in the midst
Earthquakes victims, hurricanes and tsunami waves
First they relieve funds 
Country's out of deficit
The richest nation is poor 
My future ain't definite
The old with seniority should have doe that's insuring me
So how the hell we running out of social security?

[Masta Ace]
Cars blowin' up, troops showin' up, flight plans slowin' up
Price at the gas pump goin up
Another suicide mission is what he sent us on
Cause he lied about the plane hitting the Pentagon
Another soldier in Iraq and he panics
He's dead on the ground with other blacks and Hispanics
Dyin' for a country in a world where there's no peace
Back home his brother got shot by the police</pre>
