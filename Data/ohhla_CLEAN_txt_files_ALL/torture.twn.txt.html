[Lone Ninja]
Teleport to the middle ages, severed corpses disfigured 
Faces, precious fortress obliterated					
Bitter hatred hellish Sorceress vicious, heinous
Never walk in the pit it's dangerous		
Hold the martyr in the lower parts of the castle
Lone's a monster and you're blown apart and dismantled		
Foes will rot in their shackles, flesh decay
Zone is dark isn't tranquil, it's death's parade				
You met the plaque, I'm asking the questions
Attack with aggression, extract a confession				
Rock in the Judas cradle, shocking 
Cruel and painful, not in the mood to save you 			
Brutal, fatal like in medieval times
Rude and hateful I commit evil crimes				
Captives are numb from the torture
You can't live you're hung drawn and quartered			

[June Marx]
Nightstalker, I am a Fire walker
Divine Aura, design mind torture
Time for the, live slaughter
Write horror , clive barker
Grind harder,more than arson, torch your squadron
Order coffin, warn the warden, we water boarding
Onto morning, arms foreign, Marx Sovereign
Forward Marching....Honor the Fallen
Walk with caution, the warning acknowledge
Hostile guardsmen, starving the hostage
Shards in your eyelids, wire scraping
Violating, in line for the iron maiden
Annihilation, bow low when the ruler here
Truth is clear, froze in the judas chair
Who to fear? none cold as the brutal pair
Leave the scene with your soul for my souvenir</pre>
