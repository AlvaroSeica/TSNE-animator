Fall back big boy, cause you're steppin to the best
Kenny West - test! Test! Test! 
Yo, is this thing on? Krochobok hitchcok! 
Yeah, I just dissed you in Klingon

[Cleveland Jr.]
Luccka parracka! Yeah, I speak Klingon, too!
So kiss my chocolate gunta and also hoch you 
Your flow is faded and dated deflated and constipated!
If I had to rate it - hate it! Translated, you ate it
Hey cheese ball, you've been grated
Chewed up, swallowed, and defacated
Ha, to restate it {*flips Kenny the bird*}
On the DVD this won't be pixelated! 

[Rallo]
Damn! He got him! That's my brother! 

[Kenny West]
Alright, alright, I know you think you're so hot
Question is - can you sing like a robot? 

[Cleveland Jr.]
Yes, I can sing like a robot]

[Both] And burn this mother down! {*applause*}</pre>
