[Poizunus]     
My next album gone be rock
I'm bored with Hip-Hop
 
[Chorus 1X - Poizunus]       
The Rap World is filled with Irony &amp; Cliches
All I do is smoke Kush
The Rap World is filled with Irony &amp; Cliches 
I'm so hood
The Rap World is filled with Irony &amp; Cliches
Niggaz is bitches
The Rap World is filled with Irony &amp; Cliches
You know you heard it first stupid
 
[Arlo Maverick]                    
Reel to real, Audio to stereo
Channeled through visuals of the latest rap videos
Sneakers lace the feet, fables glaze the sheet 
Textiles that bare the title technique
Weed aroma saturates, notice where cash delegates
Kani pant size, how high you elevate
Tired of cliches, tired of sound-a-likes
Ballings become contagious like pubic lice
I done heard the sob story, not to mention
Iced out concluding every sentence
Well John Blaze say "hello" to my little friend
Microphones, them some shits y'all ain't touched since â87
Note books turn rap pages, rap pages turn rap sheets
Screenplays of criminal activities
Can't forget, nominees that boycott
But the moment that they win, that award is copped, uh-ohhh
 
[Chorus 1X - Poizunus]       
The Rap World is filled with Irony &amp; Cliches
First pop models, then pop bottles
The Rap World is filled with Irony &amp; Cliches
I got weight in my Louis bag
The Rap World is filled with Irony &amp; Cliches
Yo this rap shit is a hobby
The Rap World is filled with Irony &amp; Cliches
This rap shit is a hobby
 
[Bigga Nolte]            
The rap worlds filled with cliches and ironies
I'm tryna figure out which one best defining me
I'm so thug, I'm so hood, I'm so real
Or do I do what they do just to get a record deal
Well me, I'm a be different I'm a change the game
But I couldn't be an MC without a gold chain
Or do you think that's lame for the brain
Then tell me, which MC don't got gold on they frame
Or should I be like Ice-T, cream of the crop
He went from, Cop Killer, to playing a cop
Or should I do it like the Big Boss
Cause everyday he hustling, as Officer Ross
But don't believe in the source, cause in the game you'll get lost
First, you on top, and next you'll get tossed
But that's irony, and I shouldn't even speak
Cause me, I want a video hoe that won't cheat
 
[Chorus 1X - Poizunus]       
The Rap World is filled with Irony &amp; Cliches
Life's a bitch and then you die
The Rap World is filled with Irony &amp; Cliches
Now throw your hands in the air
The Rap World is filled with Irony &amp; Cliches
And wave'm like you just don't care
The Rap World is filled with Irony &amp; Cliches
This is real hip-hop
 
[KazMega]    
So the cliches, they split us into raw and the mainstream
Played their game,] the same way, but never the same team
Control the content on both sides, but they made it seem
The mainstreams, main scheme, was sex drugs and gang themes
Irony, now the same G's that they made blow
Marketed themselves enough to make movies make clothes
Make more off of ringtones than records that they sold
So why let the labels get paid off of they flow
They ain't gon make doe, but still sign the contract
Record one hot track, the rest of the songs wack
By now all the raw cats don't see the raw facts
Live what they hear on radio think it's all fact
The ironies the raw cats are living the cliches
The fake cats create, thanks to the DJs
Who receive pay from the label reps we hate
But don't buy, just download, prior to release dates, uh
 
[Chorus 1X - Poizunus]       
The Rap World is filled with Irony &amp; Cliches
I sold drugs cause I had to
The Rap World is filled with Irony &amp; Cliches
YÃ¡ll rock a party like we do
The Rap World is filled with Irony &amp; Cliches
What's my motherfucking name
The Rap World is filled with Irony &amp; Cliches
Fuck money I rap for respect
