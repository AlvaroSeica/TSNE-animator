[TNT]
Motherfuckers spittin gas up all over town
Everytime I come around niggaz wanna be down
If I'm dissin one nigga then I'm dissin the next
Give me the pussy, the money, and the mic and then check
I'm down with Natas, down with Natas, yeah I'm down with the crew
And if you're diggin with the devil then you're down with it too
So many on that fakin funk, but I ain't fakin no funk
And while I'm makin some old wicked shit its shakin your trunk
And if its dope well tell me dope and then how dope can it be
And if it dope it ain't a motherfucker funky like T
I'm tellin niggaz, tellin niggaz better back the fuck up
You better raise up off my nuts cause I ain't givin it up

(CHORUS)(4x)
I ain't givin up no love
Ain't no love

I ain't givin up no love so tell me how can it be
I'm down with N-A-T-A-S so raise up off my blaz4me
Ain't no G-O-D drop a wicked rhyme on delivery
Makin ya shivery that evil nigga TNT
Burnin up Bibles ain't no prayin in my plan
Its time to take a stand fuck the ku klux klan
And my niggaz, my niggaz, yeah my niggaz, oh my niggaz
My niggaz are those niggaz with they fingas on the triggas
And I kick it to em stick it wicked to em stayin true
My niggaz in Kalamazoo yeah I thought you knew
But to you suckas, you suckas better back the fuck up
And raise the fuck up off my nuts cause I ain't givin it up

(CHORUS)

I'm droppin shit like one more time just to let yo ass know
I ain't givin up no love and you can't fuck with my flow
Its TNT motherfucker with my dick in my hand
Screamin fuck the police cause I know I can
I gives a fuck, I gives a fuck about the boys in blue
And if I worked at the donut shop I'll poison you
Little crazy young nigga bout to self destruct
Hangin round Esham got my head fucked up
People lovin to be livin thats a lie and a half
Niggaz cryin while they dyin and its makin me laugh
So give it to me, give it to me watch me fuck it on up
And raise the fuck up off my nuts cause I ain't givin it up

(CHORUS)</pre>
