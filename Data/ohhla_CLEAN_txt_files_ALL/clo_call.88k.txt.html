"It hurt to think of just how close we came"

[Verse One] [Phonte]
Yo, been watchin' you for awhile
Don't know if it was your lips or it was your smile
Don't know if it was your hips or it was your style
Until you put that thang on me, that's when shit got wild
We started off good, goin' to UnPlanned Parenthood
Leavin' the condom by the bed and the drawer
Until one night you let the nigga put the head in
And we ain't never use them motherfuckers no more
Started goin' in and out with the raw sex
Pulled it out, skeeted on your chest
Like bring your ass here
Playin' Justin Slayer to your Jasmine Cashmere
Till one night you said, "Baby leave it right there."
I figured I had met my match
Tongue on my neck, fingernails in my back
I figured we was cool, she said she was on the patch
So I stroked and I stroked and finally left off a batch
Like Ohhh!

[Chorus]
I try, you try
I try, you try
Just how close we came
Just how close we came
I try, you try
I try, you try
Just how close we came
Before you cum inside of me

[Verse Two]
A few months went by and I'm really startin' to dig her
Lunch in the park, picnics by the river
Sexin' all day and all night, shit is ill
So she switch from the patch and started takin' the pill
Until one night she put my hand on her stomach
And said, "Baby, we gon' be a family once I pop this kid."
I said, "Bullshit.
So let me back it.
And just explain to you, exactly what your options is.
Option one: Take this nigga to the Hoover
Or option two: Fuck on, I never knew ya."
I know it sounds crazy and it seems prideful
But I
Couldn't shake the feelin' that I was lied to
She ran out the room with mad tears in her eyes
Left her pills on the dresser right next to my copy of Get Back
I put 'em in my hand
Then put one in my mouth
Sure enough, all this time she been poppin' Tic Tac's

[Phonte singing]
First time I did it I said I wouldn't do it again
In and out, long stroke, no glove on
But it feels so good when she let me in
Get a hold of yourself boy
You're gonna me caught up
I think she got me caught up
Oh, she's gonna get me caught up
I think she got me caught up

[Chorus]
I try, you try
I try, you try
Just how close we came
Just how close we came
I try, you try
I try, you try
Just how close we came
Before you cum inside of me

[Outro] [Phonte talking]
You know what I'm sayin' like...when you told me you was on the patch
I didn't know you was talkin' about the Nicotine patch motherfucker!
Now you got me up here, I'm gonna be here in this court up here
on these trumped up charges. Got me here on these decesius allegations
under these false pretenses. What kind of shit is that? You triflin' heifer</pre>
