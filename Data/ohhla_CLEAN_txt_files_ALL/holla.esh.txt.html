[Esham talking]
The wicketshit continues
After I told these niggaz to stay off my dick
They still on my dick trying to bite the wicketshit
Niggaz still wanna know what Esham mean
Esham stands for East Side Hoes And Money
That's what I'm all about
But for all y'all niggaz bitin the wicketshit
And tryin to bite the style
I want you to think about one thing
[Samples Rakim]
Remember me? The one you gotcha idea from

Back in this bitch... yo for the 9-4
I gotta let these niggaz know once again
That I'm comin like this
They said the wicketshit was dead (dead)
Some ol' wicketshit ain't never dead
I gotta let y'all hoes know I'm comin back on yo ass

I stopped believing in god about a year ago
In god I can't trust but uh you don't hear me though
Cause my life in the sunshine ain't sunny
A suicidalist
My memory's on the bliss
But can you really dig what I dug if I drug
The life of a thug caught a .45 slug
I wish I was dead
But I'm fucked up in the head
Cause I'm kinda hesitant to kill myself
But I hate life
Life ain't nothin but money
And it ain't funny when your honey gets runny
I wish I was down but my mind spins round and around
And how many times can dead bodies be found
But you don't understand the tales of a madman
Unholy comin at your ass once again
Amen, and I don't give a fuck though
Sometimes I feel like giving up yo
It makes me wanna holla

chorus    2x

[I feel like givin up]
(Make make me wanna make make me wanna holla)
[When ever my sunshine turns to rain]
(Make me wanna holla cause my dollas come in ozones)

[Esham]
It makes me wanna holla
Life comes in dollas
Doin dirt like ring around the collar
I'll a
Can't get paid if I ain't got a trade
I dropped outta school, now who got played
A fool, I'm just tryna get mine
I'm sick a seein my moms in the welfare line
A nigga, I grew up in the ghetto
I live in the ghetto
I'm never gonna get out the ghetto
The place where black folks die
And slangin them cracks is a way to get by
There's nothin else a nigga can do
And fuck the police because they only protect you
You wouldn't understand unless you was a black man
God damn
It makes me wanna holla

chorus

[Esham]
I'm still feelin funny ways
On them sunny days when my honey plays
The money stays
Days go by and things seem to get no better
Now the bitch wanna leave, I let her
I don't sweat her
Cause it ain't in my nature
Bringing out the worst in me, I think I hate ya
I can't deal with it hoe
I gotta stay real with it though
Swo yo
My minds spinnin cause I'm drinkin that gin and juice
Tryna forget about you, bitch
You can call me crazy
When every other nigga in the hood is a crack baby
Maybe one day I'll be dead
Bleedin in the sunshine hole in my head
That's all a nigga need
Fuck a bitch stankin ass pussy always wanna bleed
I don't need that hoe
Not in my life
Not now
Yo no
It makes me wanna holla

chorus

[Esham]
It makes me wanna holla
Cause life ain't nothin but a joke
Down in the ghetto
Smellin the gunsmoke
When every other bitch is on this dick
I'm trying not to be a statistic
It's hard, I can't get a job
Mo niggaz robbin
I'm steady mobbin
They tell a nigga to look on the bright side
It ain't the black side, must be the white side
I gotta watch my back in case cops wanna act up
Get ya punk ass smacked up
Cause I know you wanna kill me
Cause I know yo ass feel me
It makes me wanna holla
