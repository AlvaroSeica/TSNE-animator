Song:   Ghetto Tale
Typed by: Cno Evil

[Chorus: King Just]
A ghetto tale, sometimes it might seem real
And if you from the ghetto, then you and I know the deal
And if it's real, then it's real
And bust a shot in the air, whip your hand like a steel
In the ghetto... nobody smiling
Nobody, nobody, nobody smiling
In the ghetto... nobody smiling
Nobody, nobody, nobody smiling

[King Just]
I don't know where to start my man, dig with dollar van Pam
Is he nasty, do it in the cab if she can
And she got a man, Beggar Bob Billy, but he broke
So he started bubbling for money, making Mike, who move coke
How I know, Jabber Jaw Jenny told me
Plus she got the low key, for telling tat to Tony
Wino Willie Walker, that New Yorker, slang talker
I will reminisce when his money was like orchard
Money let the one fifty one put him on his face
Two busy trynna taste, staircase grace
Nosey making Nancy, don't wear no panties
And I don't give a fuck if Ron and Candy can't stand me
Henny Handsome, old MC's for ransom
And I drop shit, that have your grandson dancing
I ain't branching and tripping, I ain't snitching like Nixon
Yo Just you gotta do it like -- I ain't ask for your opinion
My dominion is my domain, to ever live out the name
For those that were burnt in the flames
Old Eddie Kane, I ride the night train, with some hype frames
Talk about he might change
In an 8 point sip range, why you still fucking Silly Sandra
Shit stain, ain't shit changed
I remain in this game, the eternal flame
The everlast, to live out the name

[Chorus]

[King Just]
Old Mother Hubbard, who stash bricks in the cuppard
Kept it on the low from Little Missy Muffet
Who kept on puffing, on God day
Along came a spider, that turned her ass gay
See drunk Jack and Jill, still live in Park Hill
And Jill's knocked up, cuz she ain't take the pill
Little Bo Peep, got all the beef locked last week
Cuz she charged two g's in groceries
Jimmy Crack Corn'er, like he don't care
Like the Three Blind Mice don't stare
Ya'll niggas better beware, cows jumping over moons
Bumpy Barnaby, I came with the prunes
Tom Tom Thumb, don't run these slums
Mother Goose loose, she still repping W-Drums
Little Riding Hood back in the hood, looking good
But trust me, dog, she ain't up to no good
Boy Blue blew trial, hear the whole shit was foul
He want to see his little child, so he kidnap the child
Running wild was them Four Pigs, clown and ghost here
Carrot Top and Elvis, that's how it is when you live in the ghetto
Either you hold the fuck on, or you let go, let go

[Chorus] </pre>
