[30 second skit opens the song]

[The Game] + (Dr. Dre)
What happened in here pop, that got 'Pac and Big shot
The thick plots, now every rapper claim he let his clip pop
But even myself tote a gun and know to run
To get shot I been there before, now I'm fuckin with Doc
(Gotta do them Calvin Broadus numbers)
If not I'll pitch rocks, anticipatin, my incarceration
Media think I'm fakin like Mason
But when it come to mace fuck R. Kelly I don't take it in the face
I find out who sprayed and I'm puttin you under the pavement
No buddhist priest, catholic, or baptist pastor can save him
I'm far from religious, but I got beliefs
So I put canary yellow diamonds in my Jesus piece
I came back from the dead without a part of my chest
Laid in the hospital bed on cardiac arrest
I waited for three years while everybody else dropped
Now I understand why Nas did a song with his pops

[Chorus 2X: The Game]
I'm "Ready to Die" without a "Reasonable Doubt"
Smoke "Chronic" and hit it "Doggystyle" before I go out
Until they sign my "Death Certificate" "All Eyez on Me"
I'm still at it, "Illmatic" and that's "The Documentary"

[The Game] + (Dr. Dre)
(Documentary) If I die my niggaz, fuck it
I did a song with Mary Blige my niggaz
Got a hook from Faith, no verse from Jay
I guess on "Westside Story" he thought I spit in his face
Told Ed Lover and Monie Love I was talkin to Ja
With that Maybach line, it was payback time
Keep fuckin with me nigga, I'll put you under me
Take your car and trade it in for 8 300C's
If you cross my T, I'll dot your eyes
You'll do life in a cemetary, I'll do mine with Shyne
Come home, sit in the throne with my legs crossed
And my Air Force, middle finger up, fuck the world
Cause I'm feelin like Puff when "Life After Death" hit
"Mo' Money Mo' Problems" and I lost my best friend
I'm the second dopest nigga from Compton you'll ever hear
The first nigga only put out albums every 7 years, haha

[Ed Lover]
Haha, you know what, speakin of Jay, that just makes me roll down
Now your song, "Westside Story," you got a line that says
"Don't wear throwbacks, or drive ride in Maybachs" - was that a shot at Jay?

[The Game]
Nah I was talkin about Ja Rule
Yeah so, I mean, I got a lot of respect for Jay, y'knahmsayin
I never take shots at legends, I just, that's just somethin I don't do..

Let me tell you why I do this shit
I'ma son of a gun, cause moms was a Hoover Crip
First day I got signed I had to prove I spit
Freestyled with Busta Rhymes

[Busta] Son, duke is SICK!

The protege of Doc Dre, I can finally put the shoes on
Now that the rumors of Rakim and Cube gone
They say Truth Hurts sunk like quicksand
Don't stop me in traffic and ask about Hittman
I gotta restore the feeling, and crawl from under the rock
After the Dogg Pound crushed the buildings
I got a family to feed, I'm the middle of 9 children
We can talk about a loan after I sell 5 million
If I tell you I ain't Game and I don't know Dre
You gon' do me like Xzibit and cut half my face?
I take all the credit for puttin the West back on the map
You ain't feelin that, guess I'm Guerilla Black

[Chorus]
