Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
I see a opp I take his life for him
We rob and kill that's that shit that I'm on
Can't trust a soul that's why I keep that pipe on [x2]
I'm on that's that shit that shit that I'm on, can't trust a soul that's why I keep that pipe on
I'm on that's that shit that I'm on
I see an opp Ima take his life for him

[Verse 1]
Rob a nigga quick that's what I'm on
Pounds of that lawn know is ice on
Make-a-face time him like an iPhone
My nigga took 15 wait till law wrong, roll the belt backwards throw the L's up
Avoid the drama, I neva tell none
I be on the block, where they'll drill sum
My Lil niggas ready to kill sum
Don't let this rap shit come up and fool ya
I got my tools up and I'm a hitta [x2]
You run up on me and your are finished (L's)

[Chorus]
I see a opp I take his life for him
We rob and kill that's that shit that I'm on
Can't trust a soul that's why I keep that pipe on [x2]
I'm on that's that shit that shit that I'm on, can't trust a soul that's why I keep that pipe on
I'm on that's that shit that I'm on
I see an opp Ima take his life for him

[Verse 2]
Niggas get confused with this rap bath
Bitch I'm in the streets I'm in traffic
Nigga run up on me then it's tragic
That drama leaves his ass in a casket
Gucci belt and Gucci bandana,
That hamma got a banana
That choppa chop him down French Montana
My Robbas posted like bandanas
O.T.F that's what I'm on
300 shit that's what I'm on
Niggas claimin numbas bitch you been on, niggas tryna make it bitch we been on

[Chorus]</pre>
