Typed by: no1wammy@hotmail.com

Hook: Frost
Tell me if you wanna
Let her know, let me know
Tell me if you wanna
Let her know, let me know
Tell me if you wanna
Let me know, let me know
Tell me if you wanna
Let me know, girl

Chorus: Fingazz
Mamacita, you're so fine
I wanna take the time
The time to get to know you
Tell me, tell me, what's on your mind
Mamacita, you're so fine
I wanna take the time
The time to get to know you
Cause I wanna make you mine, girl

[Mr. Sancho]
(Verse 1)
What you find, baby
I'm just a player on the grind, lady
I'll hit you with some moves you feel up in your spine, lady
The name's Sancho, well, I'm really glad to meet ya
Baby, wanna take the time to get to know about your features
I'm a hustler, baby, but I know you with my time
Hop into my whip, baby, let's go and have a good time
I'm a player, baby, but don't you get too attached
Tell me what is on your mind, baby, I'm a kick back
Lean back
Make your toes relax
Baby girl, I'm feeling your vibe, I mean that
I see that
You want a man, I'll be that
Take you to a place
Where nobody'll be at

[Chorus]

(Verse 2)
What's on your mind, girl, come on, keep it true
Tell me what you thinking, and I'll tell you what I think of you
You look good, girl, you got it goin' on
And the way that you dressin', got him staring all along
What's up
You down to chill with a player, tonight?
It's all good
Baby girl, come on
Let's take a ride
When I want
Me and you
Come on
You're looking fly
You're trippin' cause I got you hooked
My game be tight
Pretty girl, pretty eyes, picture me in your life
Whatever
You goin' through, everything'll be fine
Tonight
Belongs to you, baby, you gon' shine
Come on
Give me a call, baby, you gon' be mine

Bridge: Fingazz
Tell me if you wanna
Spend time
Tell me if you wanna
Be mine
Tell me all the ways that you like it
I will give it to you
Tell me if you like it
This way
Tell me if you like it
That way
Tell me all your little secrets, I'll be your
Dream come true

[Frost]
What's up, pretty mama, won't you roll with Frost
Hit the highway, and we can both get lost
I can take you to a place, where you wanna go
We can move real fast, or we could take it slow

Repeat Hook

[Chorus]

[Mr. Sancho]
Let me know, let me know
Let me know, let me know
Let me know, let me know
Let me know, girl
Let me know, let me know
Let me know, let me know
Let me know, let me know
Let me know, girl</pre>
