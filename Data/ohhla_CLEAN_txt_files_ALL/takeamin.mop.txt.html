Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

It's on now
Look at what we have here
You understand what we goin through today?
You understand who you fuckin with?

[Billy Danze]
Oh what you thought we wasn't comin back?  The last time we rapped
A lot of niggaz that yapped, hit put in they place
For fragile-ly flossing, makin me wanna stick
this llama and this lauson, up in they face
(IT'S THE WORLD'S FAMOUS) You ain't gotta tell 'em
We still at it, we still batted, they still doubt it (OH!)
We do it like we do it (OH!) with nothing to hide
Hollerin Brownsville (DON'T FUCK WITH THE PRIDE)
From a world down inside (WHERE) killers and vandals
train in rugged terrain to maintain handles
(FIZZ!) Nobody touchin him (WILL!) Still double clutchin 'em
Please believe I'm out of your league (DON'T FUCK WITH HIM!)
Extrordinary rap kid, don't get yo' young ass
bumped off and dumped off the Brooklyn Bridge
I got a chip on my shoulder (AH!) and an extra clip
to fit the heavy shit on my hip and my holster

[Chorus: sped up "Take a Minute" samples]

[Lil' Fame]
It's for the listeners - for those that have an ear for this
Straight from Jamar-rrrrrrrrocko in the mix
Keep the mic crystal clear when he spit
He do it for thugs huggin the block and he's straight from the bricks
Go get your mac homes, it's Fizzy Womack homes, he back homes
He crack bones and crack domes you get your back BLOWN
We don't write battle raps for yo' ass; we catch him in the streets
Put golf clubs and bats to yo' ass
Now salute (SALUTE) to those (TO THOSE) that held it down for years
Keepin our shit on blast... (M.O.P.)
They wonder why they don't get enough M.O.P. (why that?)
Simple and plain (what?) we don't kiss ass
FUCK IT!  Let it bang, we still do our thang
Ten years in the game and ain't shit changed
Fuck the whole rap game!  Bill and Fame still killin the beats
Still bangin and we still in the streets, mother-fucker!

[Chorus]</pre>
