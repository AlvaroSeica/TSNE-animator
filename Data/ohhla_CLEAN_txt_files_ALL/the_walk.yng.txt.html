[D-Roc talking]
Ey, this D-Roc from the Ying Yang Twins (yup)
And I got Da Muzicians, Big Countrie
And B. Gizzle to help me show y'all how to walk
This is a new dance, right
It's the ghetto electric slide
So y'all got to walk with me
I said wa walk with it, wa walk with it, wa walk with it, wa walk with it

[Chorus]
Walk with me now
Step with me now
Step right with me now
To the left with me now
From the front to the back
From the front to the back
From the side to the side
From the side to the side
Walk with me, step with me, take a right with me, make a left with me
wa walk with it, wa walk with it, wa walk with it, wa walk with it

[Verse 1: D-Roc]
Get energetic
And hyperactive
Then start it dancin
Then gon do the walk
Get energetic
And hyperactive
Then start it dancing
Then gon do the walk
To the right, to the right
To the left, to the left
To the back, to the back
To the front, to the front
now take some baby steps, now take some baby steps
now take some baby steps, now take some baby steps
now take some baby steps, now take some baby steps
now take some baby steps
To the right, to the left
To the right, to the left
To the back, to the front
To the back, to the front

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Countrie Biggs]
up in my pimp mode
movin through the club in slow mo
slow the slump down, wit my arm hangin real low
knowin somthing new, cause they never see me move before
I might be a big nigga, but still clor rug
So come on shawty let go
To the fuckin dance flo
let me see you shake it, pop that thang
oh you a nasty ho
make that thang walk slow
come on take it to the flo
Walk wit me one time, yeah shawty make it low

[Verse 3: Homebwoi]
bizzle got the pistol
put one in ya make ya whizza
relocate your body part
hey ya walkin like a crippa
when nigga be actin quicka
pick her up, they start to tripa
cant blast either nigga
ass down to the whizza
betcha got a isha
blame your trick
my four people call their people
when ya say somethin bitch
see a ho, get a ho, fuck it blame one bitch
atcha with your dick in my hand
my hand burnin

[Chorus]

[Verse 4: B.G.]
you know I walk wit a tip and my jeans always sag
I don't have to wear a belt, my pistol hold up my pants
I'm a a original gangsta, cool as they come
Step in a club, look around-would choose anyone
I bruise any nigga wanna go there wit me
better know I go everywhere wit that 4-4 wit me
I go in a strip club withcho ho wit me
Walk out wit to mo, ready to get busy
I'm whatever if it come to it
like my idea just do it
more then half of you niggaz
sold a product and ran through em
man I'm a fool with it
I'm a beast with it
beat the slave, grope em, run in man I'm keep kickin it
And I'm knee deep in it and I hold it down
born and raised in New Orleans, Lousiana-Uptown
I hit it how I live, it ain't just talk
you can tell I'm the shit by the way I walk

[Chorus]</pre>
