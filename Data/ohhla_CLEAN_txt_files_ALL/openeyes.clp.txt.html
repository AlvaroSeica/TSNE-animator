Typed by: newos_crib_is@hotmail.com

[Chorus 3X: Queen "Bohemian Rhapsody" sample]
Open your eyes
Look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy

[Pusha T]
Seeing is believing, believe when you see it
They saying I'm the best, shit I'm just tryna be it
They tied me to a mountain of it, I just tried to sky it
Long distance wireless, +Kinect+ like I Wii it
W, double I, spell so you can see it
cause it's way over their heads when I Ray Allen 3 it
I'm Rondo on the bongos when giving you my convo
We ain't been home since we was snatched out the Congo
Toast to progress as I'm staring out my condo
Made it this far and I ain't never been a Tonto
Yeah, as you compare me to a fucking rookie
You can't respect the new school when you played hookie
Cooked white, turned to tan so the world Snooki
School of Hard Knocks, look at where the game took me
To the limit like Montana with better grammar
Bigger homes with bigger guns and better cameras

[Chorus 2X]

[Pusha T - over chorus]
You are now listening to the future
Open your eyes nigga, see what I see
Don't mind me, I'm just here to restore the feeling
Yeah, I'm just here to restore the feeling
You feel the pressure, yeah

[Pusha T]
I never pitched a penny in a wishing well (never)
I laid it all on a fishing scale (yes)
And an apron that hung from a kitchen nail
Straight from my memoirs as I kiss and tell
Big faces like Rushmore, touch more
Fashion trailblazers, trendsetters look to us for
the next mission when the tides rise up
With no inner vision, yet they eyes wide shut
Fifteen years of ducking spies like us
Confidential informants disguised like us
Jail doesn't resonate with guys like us
Told Wesley at the Oscars to slide like us
Didn't listen, so prison is what they did to him
Accountant unscathed, millions is what they hid through him
Same principles you must adhere
Lohans get the breaks, the T.I.'s, we just stare through 'em

[Chorus 2X]

[Pusha T - over chorus]
The odds is against us, no excuses though
We just play harder, hustle smarter
Yeah, they done freed Weezy
Congratulations my nigga
Now let's just go~! Yeah~!</pre>
