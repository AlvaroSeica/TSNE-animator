[Kracker] I guess this is where I get off
[Kid Rock] Yep, remember everything I told you
[Kracker] Yep
[Kid Rock] Got Your Song Book
[Kracker] Yep
[Kid Rock] Got them beats I gave you
[Kracker] Yep
[Kid Rock] Money
[Kracker] Yep
[Kid Rock] Cell Phone
[Kracker] Mmm Hmm

[Kid Rock] What's wrong
[Kracker] What if I don't make it
[Kid Rock] That's impossible
[Kracker] But what if
[Kid Rock] Fuck what and tell if to suck my dick
[Kracker] Ha
[Kid Rock] I taught you to well for that
[Kid Rock] Besides the money's already made and the foundation has already been laid
[Kid Rock] Now, remember the most important thing I taught ya
[Kid Rock] When it gets crazy out there with the money and the girls and the fame
[Kracker] What's that
[Kid Rock] Make sure you pinch it at the top before you roll it down
[Kracker] Got it
[Kid Rock] Now get out of here</pre>
