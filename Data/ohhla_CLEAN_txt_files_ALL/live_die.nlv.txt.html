*NOTE: Big Mann pronounces Ghetto "Ghetho"*

{Hook: Big Mann [singing]}
Will I live or die? Will I survive
In the Ghetto, in the ghetto, in the ghetto?
Will I live or die? Will I survive
In the Ghetto, in the ghetto, in the ghetto?

{Verse 1: Tec-9}
Shot gun blastin the Grim Reaper done claimed nuttin but 15
Blood to a blood, wha?
Just seen lil homie last week
In a drop top with a cell phone
Twenty inches of chrome suffered 2 to the dome
But it aint no thing time to bury another one
Get a T-shirt with a face on it
Say bye-bye for a little while then run on it
Best not ride the man of revenge is thinkin about that one
Walk up the block with a head bouncin for another example
Look out! Timmy got his hands on a Semi-automatic
And is bout that static in mourning to the brothers in Natic
Timmy's mother is a crack head
Which means Timmy was crack fed
Thats unfair but point me out somebody who care
Yet we feed out when that poison exploded, brothers gon suffer
Its a wonder why we got so many dykes, all the woman got is each other
A poor mans reality is a mad mans mentality
No alteritives no resources
Fuck college... Street courses
Niggaz fuckin with dope with out no fear for the pain
Dead and gone before he gone done bust a hole through the vain
Who's gonna make the babies ladies with pornographic ideas?
Automatically being labeled as a murder fanatic
Slow body process from the greedy to needy
Got they nuts off in the sand
Get a faith check, gave it all up to the dope man
Niggaz robbin they own connects to become the Big Tymer
Bitches gon drop a dime on you send em off where they can find yah
Will I live?

{Hook: Big Mann [singing]}
Will I live or die? Will I survive
In the Ghetto, in the ghetto, in the ghetto?
Will I live or die? Will I survive
In the Ghetto, in the ghetto, in the ghetto?
Will I live or die? Will I survive
In the ghetto baby
In the ghettoooo

{Verse 2: Lil Ya}
Yo, yo I'm only 5 foot 6 but I got big ballz
I did it all from walk by's to drive by's in a U-Haul
Not givin a fuck has always been my motto
I'ma nigga chaser, after paper, bullets hollow
Dont let me hit yo block in all black nigga
Bust 50 shots if you dont die I'm comin back nigga
I been a fool with the tool since my youngin
Fuck strugglin I'm bout hustlin and bustin
Some say you gotta crawl before you walk, livin the street life
The same say dont bring a knife to a gun fight
A couple of people say 2 wrongs dont make a right
My niggaz say never leave home with out ya plastic pipe
But on the rizeal they betta chizzle I'm ready to kizzle
And spizzle the blood from my strizzle, ya fizill?
You done fucked up and met the boss
Test my nuts if any nigga wanna play the part
Will I live or die?

{Hook: Big Mann [Singin]}
Will I live or die? Will I survive
In the Ghetto, in the ghetto, in the ghetto?
Will I live or die? Will I survive
In the Ghetto, in the ghetto, in the ghetto?
Will I live or die? Will I survive
In the ghetto baby
In the ghettoooo
Will I live or die? Will I survive
In the ghetto baby
In the ghettoooo
Will I live...</pre>
