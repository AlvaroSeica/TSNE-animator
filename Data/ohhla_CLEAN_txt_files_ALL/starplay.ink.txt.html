[Chorus]
I swear if bad girls had a team
You'd be the mascot and the star player
You got skills baby that I never seen
You tryna ball, you could be my star player
Star... you can be a star
Everything will change if you'll be my star player
Star... you can be a star
I can put you in the game, come and be a star player

[Verse 1]
I said if bad girls had a team
You'd be the MVP of the league
And everything ain't always what it seem
In the dark, it ain't hard, I can tell you a freak
Just come with me and you can be a star
Go on, keep it rollin, now I tell you when the scene is off
Fly motherfucker, wnt like you got Adidas on
Sippin this Patrone, bet I get you in the better zone
That's what you better know, tell me yes, never know
Let me be the coach and I'm a get you wins like Michael Jordan
All them other bitches ain't important, I ignore them baby
When you hit the floor you be the only that's going

[Chorus]
I swear if bad girls had a team
You'd be the mascot and the star player
You got skills baby that I never seen
You tryna ball, you could be my star player
Star... you can be a star
Everything will change if you'll be my star player
Star... you can be a star
I can put you in the game, come and be a star player

[Verse 2]
I said if bad girls had a team
On me, I'll be sittin every game floor seats baby
Swear it can be the shoes on yo feet
Every time that you score I be lookin for the rebound
Just come with me and you could be yourself
I can lend a hand if you need the help
So take another shot, let it roll
Game hitter, show em what you've been trainin for
And we can win it girl, tell me that you in it
I've been scoutin for a minute and you the one that I'm feelin up
Every time you walk in the building then you steal the show
I just got a feeling I can bring a side out that you didn't know

[Chorus]
I swear if bad girls had a team
You'd be the mascot and the star player
You got skills baby that I never seen
You tryna ball, you could be my star player
Star... you can be a star
Everything will change if you'll be my star player
Star... you can be a star
I can put you in the game, come and be a star player

Star...
I can put you in the game
Everything will change
Just come with me and you can be a star
Ridin with the team, you ain't never lost
Take another shot, let it roll
Show em what you've been trainin for
Star player
