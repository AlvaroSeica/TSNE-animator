[ScHoolboy Q]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh, the ground rising, the sun falling
My day is cool, my night's yawning {*yawns*}
Uh, ain't nothing else to do but
move at the speed of light, ayyy, I'm taking flight
Uh, yeah, NASA left behind
I'm so beyond, somewhere with Megatron
I'm super gone, you can't relate to him
and ummm, let me free my mind
Ooooh, I see it all
The galaxy, she want my all
Uh, feel like it's child's play
Dive through a Milky Way, fulfill my destiny
As I cooperate, I record plays
My record spins, nigga whirlwind
Yeah, I see it all
Become a star, tryna shine through the fall, aw

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
See you in the morning, take off nigga, I'm time-zoning
Tell 'em I'm sky-high
Going-going-going up there nigga, I'm time-zoning
Tell 'em I'm sky high
I'm sky high, nigga I'm sky high
See you in the morning, going-going-going

[ScHoolboy Q]
The ground rising, the moon falling
My night's cool, my day's yawning {*yawns*}
Uh, ain't nothing else to do but
move at the speed of light, ayyy
We travel like a comet, supersonic, just watch out when I accelerate
Moving at the speed of light, ain't no thoughts of me using brakes
Uh, inhaling gravity, excelling Hubble
Check my levels, check my levels, turn me up, turn me up
What the fuck? Got your bitch, she on my nuts, on my nuts
all because a nigga cool, man I swear she act a fool
Man you know I keep it real, man for reals
Man you know I'm super-ills, went to Pluto, gave it chills
Man I swear there no appeals, rising from my heels
with no ceiling over ground, probably never coming down
Yeah, I see it all
Become a star, tryna shine through the fall, aw

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
My turbo boosting, my jet pack cruising
Get jet lag when I come back to these fucking humans
I can put planet Earth in a canister
then continue my crater search with Captain Kirk
Look at my verse, you seeing signs
You hearing signals deciphered from District 9
No fucking rapper cipher when meteors flying
The meters are flying, but I'm way faster
Run away, bet I catch up, fire like striking matches
I'm higher with martians laughing in spaceships, it's starships crashing
Hover above the masses, a massive attack when mixing
Kendrick Lamar with magic, pull rabbits from hats
Niggas, wanna hope on tracks, bitches, wanna hop on dick, damn~!
Is that a fucking blimp? No O-M-G that's him
A shooting star hanging over a new eclipse, hanging over a big dick
When my music flip, nigga I'm sky high, shit

[Chorus]</pre>
