[Minnesota Slimz]
Emerge from the depths dwelling, the subterranean
The deep I be like hawk, you know, the inside of you cranium
Descend to the pit of the abyss, got to wrestle with the demon
To bring the funk, screaming through my thought vessel
Ignite shells, to burn like hells, you the dark and idle
Escape on the funky transmitted through my satellite
Thoughts transforming, to vapor
To which escape through my mind state on the paper
The funk is sweet, I gets deep and speak tragedy
Danger, where the fucking chain, bolt you skull cavity
I dwell in the bowels of hell, penetrating matter
Giving birth, to the funk to make the earth shatter
I walk along the edge of insanity
Stalk the underworld with the dreads of humanity
Lurk in the shadows of madness, enter the chamber
I paint pictures of anger on canvas
My verse be cursed with horror, I'm demented
I be the brain child of my wicked father
Admit pen, when I transmit, commit
Murderous thoughts, only corpse enter my orbit
Once again it's the menace of the metropolis
Mark Danger, so enter the chamber of the apocalypse

[Chorus: Minnesota Slimz (Rakim sample)]
It's the demons that be taking control of my mind
(Can't hold it back, I'm looking for the line)
It's the demons that be taking control of my mind
(Can't hold it back, I'm looking for the line)
It's the demons that be taking control of my mind
(Can't hold it back, I'm looking for the line)
It's the demons that be taking control of my mind
(I never let the mic magnetize me no more)

[Minnesota Slimz]
Check it, inside my skull I hear the voice of the devil
My hands tremble, imprisoned in the core of the inner level
My bed spills blood spirits of evil
Animate on the page, emanating from my cerebral
Trapped in the world of hell, escorted by a hoard of demonic forces
To commence mergers with the dark lord
Insane with madness, tint in the midst
My mental's full of agony, my soul's a total eclipse
I spit the slits from my lips of contamination
Compose demonic symphonies of abomination
Demons creep through the crevices
Of my paper, pen and pad to inflict your nemesis
Walk the stages of metamorphosis
I stalk this metropolis to test my visions of the apocalypse
Membranes transmit the ill data
Blood splatter as funk maggots eat through your brain matter
I draw my dag' up, to try to slay the demons
Slit the wrist of my cadaver, dwelling forever in the lower region
Cast a spell, incarcerated in hell
The lines of my paper become the bars of my prison cell

[Chorus]</pre>
