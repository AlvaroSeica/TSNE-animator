Them niggaz knew that shit before it happened
Word 'em up

[Chorus] x4
So while you stepin thru...Steppin' thru hardcore  --&gt; PMD
Kickin that styles for 96 niggaz back to the... --&gt; Das EFX

[PMD]
I can see clearly now, the rain is gone, word is bond
I brainstorm, trippin of flashbacks like Vietman
I stay armed
Code red mayday, Hit Squad nigga
PMD is back oh shit, yeah its pay day
Oh yeah Hosey I make rhymes sway and I don't play
Or I'm so so
Niggaz down with ?
Touche hey, ya betta keep ya eye on a birdie
Word G thats opsurd see
It's far from "baby come back"
Like the Be Gees so you can run run
But you can't hide or slide
Locked in, ain't fire, bullseye
You see me close thats more props
You fly guy, big super star takes nose dive
With no life jacket, pump like swaket

Check it out now
I kick the habit
Bring it to me now
It's 94 no backstabin

[Chorus] x4

So while you stepin thru...Steppin' thru hardcore  --&gt; PMD
Kickin that styles for 96 niggaz back to the... --&gt; Das EFX

[PMD]
So what you sayin, you hear my records playin
Funk smellin bad, like a tooth decayin'
Bring it to me now
Cool
Pack tools, truck jewels, niggaz stuck in the pit stop
With flex and no view
So if you down with the Hit Squad
Say Hit Squad and my dick 's hard, I'm charged
Tryna walk down the rap yard
So bring it on flex, no check, ?might wreck to deep the half step?
Tryna step, get souplexed word to Das EFX
Of course I'm back to get payed
Stickin hard like D-backs and the rappers in the gator raid
Yeah punk, settin the tone for the rap game
Niggaz claimin fame now that is a damn shame
Out the open like the US without tennis
I pump rhymes like niggz pump iron and Guiness
You get flood
I keep my shit raw
So while you steppin thru, steppin thru hardcore

[Chorus] x4

So while you stepin thru...Steppin' thru hardcore  --&gt; PMD
Kickin that styles for 96 niggaz back to the... --&gt; Das EFX

[PMD]
It's the 'ol ill phill, double flow spill Jill
OK to mill, to give a read on the rap field
Kids must see, yeah so daddy will kill
Any pool party'n motherfuckin'
Yeah sleep, get your head crushed
Hit Squad mad tight kid
94, no bumrushin'
Strictly hear to cool out and turn the party's out
Hardcore underground
Thats what is all about
Not with the does, hoes and limos
Thats not my ammo
My ammo 's a pro
Check the demo

Kickin that styles for 96 niggaz back to the... --&gt; Das EFX

[Chorus] x4

So while you stepin thru...Steppin' thru hardcore  --&gt; PMD
Kickin that styles for 96 niggaz back to the... --&gt; Das EFX

Kickin that styles for 96 niggaz back to the... --&gt; Das EFX</pre>
