Woke up early Sunday mornin' 
And before I could get outta bed
I got blood stains all on my t-shirt 
Last night my homie caught a slug in his head
It was a Saturday night and everything was all right
Until some fool tried to disrespect
My homie whipped out the heater, the 9 millimeter
And col' put his ass in check, well
Them suckas rolled off and we thought it was over
But little did we know we was wrong
Them came racin' 'round the corner, barrel's stickin' out the window
The bullets flyin' cold blew out his dome
My homie got shot

(CHORUS)(2x)
My homie got shot, he's a goner black
He's a goner
My homie got shot, he's a goner black
My homie got shot

My homie fell to the ground and I knew he was dead
By the painful look in his face
Bloodstains on my shirt, God damn my nigga hurt
'Cause his brains was all over the place
Well, I'm thinkin' 'bout gettin' back, time for the payback
I know where these niggaz be
When they shot my fuckin' homie, they left me by my lonely
And col' took a peace a me
Well, I got ta creep up on 'em, 'bout to put one in 'em
But before I could do all that
A nigga caught my ass slippin' at point blank range
.45 put 'em in my back
My homie got shot

(CHORUS)</pre>
