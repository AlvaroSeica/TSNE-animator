Dear Dad, the class began, hands were held and arms were open
Moments stolen from the globe and life's blood was always spoken
One was chosen for another. Broke my will against your wisdom
Pushed my face towards the light so I could cultivate the vision
Made decisions for the unit. Hard times, you moved us through it
By each word and every movement, you're the one who showed me what truth is
Thanks for the blueprint passed down. I'll grip it by the cover
Plus you showed me how to love my wife by the way you treat my mother
And Mom, you sacrificed your body, scarred beneath the weight
To usher my soul into the universe, human contact, you were first
Through the worst I had to offer, caught his mercy in your stare
You were there. Patched my wounds an protected me with your prayers
Gave me food when I was hungry. Gave me love when I was empty
Gave me a look of knowing solitude when I said where God would send me
Thanks for the days and the nights, the laughter and the fights
Teaching me wrong from right, Mom, the first woman in my life
To my brother, thanks for the beatdowns and the harassment
In you I learned to express my views with heated passion
Followed your footsteps good or bad, so please get the facts straight
My big brother introduced me to this and gave me my first rap tape
I watched you grow up, thrive, prosper and self destruct
Find the jewel in circumstances that sucked but still you stuck
A husband and a father, a brother and a son
Kevin, I'm so proud of the man that you've become
Pam, Jeff, Billy, Cliff, Paine, David, Terry, Chris, Ricky
The names stick with me, the names stick with me
Jason Lee, Ben Heaton, Josh Cleveland, Eric Sartain
Trent Gibson saw the best and the worst I've ever given
Sintax, I'd bend back the sky and shift the balance
I thank you for your strong mind, your friendship and your talent
Your example to all that witness 'cause there's no "I" in crew
You inspire me brother 'cause I can see Christ in you
Dust, where to start? The art's answer to my question
Blessed from lessons together that's always led to progression
This profession needs your genius to show cats what it's about
You keep making the music and I'll keep running my mouth
Playdough, Harry Krum, enough heart for every alias
Thanks for helping me carry the torch as we take these kids
Listener, Illtripp, Fred B, Recon
Rabbi, Manuel, Sev Statik and Sivion
It's on until we change the face and finish what we started
I'm thankful that you're all a part of this
Yeah it's on until we change expression, finish what we started
Deepspace5, it's never stopping
Mary, I don't have the words to get across my feelings
I breathe a purer form of oxygen when I'm staring at your face
I can rise above my limits and break through this vaulted ceiling
I'm a better man today because you occupy my space
I hit the road, you hold it down and shun the glory
I'll be the mouthpiece for your heart and I'll tell the world our story
Thanks for bearing our children. Thanks for sharing your life
Thanks for saying, "Yes," May. Thanks for being my wife
To my daughters and all unborn and future seeds
I look at the world through your eyes and you always help me see
Inspiration in your innocence and the future in your face
I write these songs so I can make your world a better place
And that's all to say that all that I am is a collection of souls
That God has used to touch me. Changed a reflection
Made a man from a simple stick-figure
And if I've ever met you, then you helped him paint the picture..
