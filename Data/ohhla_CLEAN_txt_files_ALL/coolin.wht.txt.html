Sittin in my Lazy Boy watchin MTV
Just my lady, my partner, his lady and me
Sippin Dom Perrignon, don't answer the phone
I got servants to do it, cause I'm king of the throne
Rap titles I take, MC's I shake
Never play when I'm ryhmin, there's too much at stake
You think I would give all of this stuff up
You're a crazy, lazy, daisy duck (?as I pluck?)
So don't ever mess with us or you might not live
Especially when we're coolin in the crib

We're coolin
Coolin in the crib
Just coolin
Coolin in the crib

( *scratching of* )
(Coolin in the crib)

Lots of people go to clubs, chill around the way
But the crib is the place that I like to stay
I got a microwave oven, big screen TV
Steam room, sauna bath, water b-e-d
A wall full of medals from the battles I've won
And a golden microphone shinin bright as the sun
Cordless telephone, answering machine
With the pre-recorded rhyme that sounds real mean
Says "I'm sorry, but the White Boys aren't in
Leave a message at the tone or call again
And if you really wanna see us come where we live
You'll find us coolin in the crib"

We're coolin
Coolin in the crib
(Mr. Ed)
Just coolin
Coolin in the crib

( *scratching of* )
(Coolin in the crib)

Now in my crib I got my own studio
I keep it cool like me around 10 below
Because we work out there with a beat and a mic
Precise and Exact, kickin lines all night
When a friend comes to the crib to cool out
I look at my partner, he begins to shout
Put on your Swatch watch and your Converse shoes
And show the homeboys what you can do

Well, I can (1)
I can (2)
I can (3)
I can (4)
I can bust a def rhyme time after time
If rap was a mountain, you wouldn't need to climb
You see me and Precise got a rhyme that can't miss
And if you don't believe that, ahaha, bust this
M.J. Precise rockin twice as nice
Always pay the price when he rolls the dice
All the time gettin paid, savin money that we made
Seven days a week always get laid
( ? ) friends, ( ? ) fools, fly fresh females
I'm super, sly, sexy, sharp as a nail
So if you see somebody don't tell what we did
Just tell em to come and cool in the crib

We're coolin
Coolin in the crib
(White Boys)
Just coolin
Coolin in the crib

( *scratching of* )
(Coolin in the crib)

We're coolin
Coolin in the crib
(Yeah)
Just coolin
Coolin in the crib
(What we doin now)
We're coolin
(Oh yeah)
Coolin in the crib
(Everybody now)
We're coolin
Coolin in the crib</pre>
