[Intro: Truck]
I feel you, God, I'm feeling your pain, man
I'm going through the same shit myself
And you know what's funny, Eamon?
Same shit just happened to me last night, man
And that's why I came all the way from the other side of the Island
To help you with this remix

[Eamon]
See I don't, know why, I liked you so much
I gave you all, of my trust
I told you, I loved you
Now that's all down the drain, you put me through pain
I wanna let you know I feel

[Chorus 2X: Eamon]
Fuck what I said it don't mean shit now
Fuck the presents, might as well throw them out
Fuck all those kisses, they didn't mean jack
Fuck you, you ho I don't want you back

[Eamon]
You thought, you could, keep this shit from me
You burnt bitch, I heard the story
You played me, you even gave him head
Now you're asking for me back, you're just another hack
Look elsewhere, cuz you're done with me

[Chorus 2X]

[Truck]
Bitch, you busted, yeah, caught dead in the act
Cell phone, camcorder, nigga blowing ya back
There's a thin line, between love and hate
I should of knew it from the start, that your ass was fake
I paid your bills, bought your clothes, and put food on your plate
And this is how you pay me back, thinking things was great
It's kinda strange how I found out, your friend riding my dick
Gave the info, hoping I blow her back out
You know Truck, I'm like fuck it, man, two tears in a bucket
You did enough to this relationship, that I can't fuck with
Girl, you was the one, that I argued with my niggas over
I know you don't wanna hear it, giving me the cold shoulder
For a second, I can't front, you kinda hurted the God
Especially when I heard, you gave his ass a fucking blowjob
Why, you ho, I hope your batch is packed
And leave my kids on the table, I don't want you back, you bitch

[Eamon]
You questioned, did I care
You can ask anyone, I even said your were my great one
Now it's, all over
But I do admit I'm sad, it hurts me real bad
I can't sweat that, cuz I love the ho

[Chorus]</pre>
