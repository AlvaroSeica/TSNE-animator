Album:  Ancient Tapes 2
Song:   Legend of a Fighter
Typed by: Quest Rah

Awoke like a voltage
Dosage ferocious
Mind focused
Soul more ancient than locusts
I wrote this hope to the hopeless Im potent
Throw a rope around a rodent
He wrote dope scrolls emperor unfolded
Buss wit more colors than mural spray solvents
The code of a shogun
A lost art form inspire
Renaissance thinkin'
City dwellers hittin' rocks
now their ships sinkin'
turn off the top 20 B cost hats all hell
I dig deeper than oil wells my life written in '84 like orwell
Inhale
Rain or hail its all well
I'm a mistaken male
So my hands pleadin' for divine bail
while you tryina chase a gold trail
an get devoured like a fox frail
cut like a fishscale
it's real lyrics no tricks so bag this
No games wit this rap thing Global wit my faction Vintage wit the rappin
Like turntable crackling
Provoke react like Gadaffi clash Asterix axe chop thru the nafs of self
Light an incense  Daily grind intense Interest swellin' evil interests
revoltin like incest
Instead
I kick back rhymes on the menu
Respect for the positive power move makers in the venue
Yeah grow from the roots way
Come wit the good vibes like roots reggae tracks On a summer sunny day
Its more than the music Artists get dissolved  like sugar in the fluid
Ain't stupid to get shot wit arrows like cupid
Its movements we do this don't lose kid
Salaam to my fam walaikum salaam
Bringing peace to the circle like the yin in the yang

we vibe Ridiculous
Sun rays be the stimulus
we mean business
like bad food killin' us
I gotta give it up
I gotta give up
Peace to my fam
I gotta give it up...</pre>
