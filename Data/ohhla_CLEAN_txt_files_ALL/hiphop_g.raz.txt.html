[Hell Razah]
Hell Razah I reps the Nu Kemet
We be no gimmick, I give niggas the business
You be too tentitive to fuck with each sentence
I'm next presented of the Maccabee lineage
Flows be authentic, eight bars I'm in it
About to take this game in a New York minute
I ain't one of them niggas who ain't living
The crown on tilted to the side 'cause you don't fit it
Me, I've been king of the hood since Champion hoody
Before back was the place to Philly
It ain't pretty when your face gotta taste the semi
It was friendly when we all had to scrape for pennies
Gimme twenty emcees that was never signed
And then I take twenty more before I drop a line
As now more niggas with deals who can't rhyme
Now that's forty-nine niggas ate at the same time
Brrt, Renaissance</pre>
