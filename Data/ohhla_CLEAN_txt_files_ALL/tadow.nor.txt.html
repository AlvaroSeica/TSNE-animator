If you ain't talkin dollars, I ain't tryin to holla

Fuckin with them ese's fillin up them chargers
Gas ain't in them gas tanks, them shits filled with powder
Caskets for you cowards, bang out let it rang out
Call my chopper Method Man the way it bring that pain out
RRAH! You heard that, ain't no way to swerve that
Bullets flip you on yo' ass that chopper push that curve back
YEAH! Fuck around with the wrong one

Dark skin nigga with a long gun, right there, that's nightmare
Like Elm Street, this hell week I'm Candyman with that white chair

[Chorus: French Montana]
