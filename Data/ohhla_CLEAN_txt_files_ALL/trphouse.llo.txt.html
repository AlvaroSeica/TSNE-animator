[Intro: Lounge Lo]
Stoneys... yoooooooo...
Crunch Lo, what up, man?
Yo, come downstairs
Stone Desert, I see you, boy
Whatever...

[Lounge Lo]
Aiyo, Stoney, what it be's like, I'm back in the background
And while you was grinding, niggaz put that cash down
Unless they wanted me dead, but they don't clap rounds
And so they passed the bread, told my man to act out
So he backed out with a Mac out, and black out
Hit the nigga top with a shot, and then he dashed out
Got a connect, O.T., in the crackhouse
They go on par then and show what the Stat 'bout
Slash four hundred and something, aiyo, peace Brim
Yo, I'm in, yes, who? Crackhead pumpkin
Wop City, yes, the era, the Stones forever
Guerilla Hill all day, but the hallway's better
Know niggaz that'll sneak in ya house, run through ya cheddar
And fuck ya wife's mouth while you watch and let her
And it's the O.K. Corral, man, no matter the weather
I throw two up in ya coat and watch you scatter with feathers

[Desert Eagle]
You don't really want it with the wideback bully
You can't see my face in this pointy black hoody
Ratchet on my waist, clip filled 'til I pull 'im
If I catch him out of pocket, you know I'm gon' do 'im
You speaking through the wire, ya boy Young Chris'll snoop 'im
I'm the Marlon of the movement, commando of the troopers
Send them corners boy at you, plant one in ya medula
I've grown to love rap, but the passion is the Ruger
Nigga, I'm here to teach ya, ya boy came back to school ya
Get one question wrong, get slapped with a ruler
I, am the prophecy, the lion of Judah
Nigga, stop it, I'm the topic when they come to the shooters

[Crunch Lo]
Aiyo, I'm Black Hawk Down in the bushes with the choppers
Soon as you appear, break you off, something proper
Swiss cheese a nigga for big figures
There ain't enough room, so a third of y'all is getting consumed
I'm a beast, I smell the blood, squeeze the nectar out of a thug
Live wire niggaz get turned to unplugged
We the ice grill, scarred up mugs, from out Stat
If you floss too much, we gon' run in ya trap
Take it all like a divorce, the workers and the boss
Get pressured, come for test us, you're taking a loss
This is course 101, thuggery, keep a gun on me
A near hit from the rear, it's Crunch Lo, nigga, in here

[Chorus: Desert Eagle]
Do it like the O.K. Corral and black out
Stoneys get wild on the Isle, what the chat 'bout?
Run in y'all mouth, to a weapon get backed out
Finger-fucking ya stash, all up in the trap house
We could get down, nigga what? Let's black out
Stoneys get wild on the Isle, what the chat 'bout?
Run in y'all mouth, to a weapon get backed out
Finger-fucking ya stash, all up in the trap house

[Outro: Lounge Lo]
Aiyo, Desert, man, what's good with you, my yessa?
Crunch Lo, there ain't nothing changed, my yessa
Huh? The Stone Gang, man...
Y'all know what it is, man...
I see y'all... Hillside Stones...
The Stone Scrambler Gang... Hah!
I.N.F.-Black, I see you...
Fase, Hah! Yeah, man...
Staten Island, One-five-tray...
Reez, Fox and them boys, Samolian gang, I see y'all over there
Hah! J.J.P., you know what it be, man...
Word up, Sun God, I see you, nigga, I see you, boy
Get that shit rough, T.M.F., Trife, Wigs, Whispers...
Hola at ya yessa, man, y'all know what we do...
Staten Island... Guerilla Hill all day
Stone Gang Beneeni, man
Stoney... yoooooooooo....</pre>
