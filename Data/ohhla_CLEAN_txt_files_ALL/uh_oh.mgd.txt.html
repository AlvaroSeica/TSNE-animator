[Chorus]
Uh Oh {*repeat 8X*}

Give me the trap and i'ma set it up with fine bait
Give me the ice, and i'll show y'all bustas how to skate
Give me the time i'ma consume and straight cultivate
Give me the money to stage and the mic and i'm straight
I can tell you ain't hard, y'all bustas soft
They find a neutral spot, they let go loot so i'ma go off
I don't imitate styles, I got flows
Now watch the special delivery to you motherfucking hoes
Check one two with the mic, check the game
Check the handling when I step to change a lane
Check the straight knot on them hoes I be checkin
Now check ya playa status from the chicks i'm collecting

[Chorus] - 2x

Now put a cap on that bullshit y'all talkin bout mister rapper
I'm fed up to here with that ??? so i'ma slap you
Saying gangsta rhymes and doing whole things that don't mix
Uh huh, you about to get caught up in the mix
I'm from St. Louis, the clean town was the hood
Disrespect, watch me make it understood
Ya better have somebody to call twelve
I'm pissed off and I'm about to raise hell
And I won't bite my tongue for none of y'all
I'm just gone crush you quick, like the impact of a wrecking ball
I just drunk some gin and it made me worse
If I don't get some green, your next ride gone be in a hearse

[Chorus] - 2x

I got the ice cold water to put your fire ass out
And the hoes hooked up to the hydrant in case you spread, no doubt
You bustas through, we coming through
Fatball and mad society run through
We bout to drown, we murder bound
Get it together cause tonight it's going down
I can't stop, I can't quit
So one of y'all end up getting a wig split
It ain't nothing you can do to take us under
Cause we warriors, playas, soulja killas, and hater hunters
Y'all just unchained the wrong clique
For the next ten years, we gone be running this shit

[Chorus] - repeat till fade</pre>
