[Intro: 50 Cent]
I'll give you somethin to talk about (RRRRRRRRR!!!!!)
Come around me frontin I'll air you out, I go off

[Verse One: Beanie Sigel] (50 Cent)
I don't shoot shit off nigga I gun it down (Yeah)
Walk up on niggas and run 'em down (Uh Huh)
Pull a stock out that K throw a hundred rounds
Won't stop 'til your box lowered underground
Put you in the urn, your bones will burn
The rap guerilla the wack rap ringtone killer
I'm here, to find a nigga equally realer it's rare
You can meet me in the square if you dare to come near
I have no morals, just a whole lot of piss and a dick for you
Bullets and a clip for you, this the ignorance 
at least it looks that way when you witness it kill at witnesses
Bury the hatchet, matter of fact bury the casket
Kill niggas bury the ratchet (AHHHHHHHHH!!!)
Pick it back up if I have to, I used to bump niggas
And pump niggas out for the practice (WOOOOOOOO HOOOOOO!!!!)
The shit starter, the shit finisher
I don't know what's harder, when they release ya or when they sentence ya
The realness, back like I promised
Ready to dig a nigga shit like a colonic (OWWWWWWWWWWW!!!!!)
I go off!!

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I know it's them again from last time remember them 
They can't believe we back up in the club (We back baby!)
Because you sippin on that Henny and my bitch will get the Semi 
And you fuck with me I'm 'gon let it off (RRRRRRRR!!!!!)
I go off! Off in this bitch like it's legal a nigga move around with the eagle
I go off! We say you get it if we don't believe you
This is 50 Cent and Beanie Sigel! I go off!

[Verse Two: Beanie Sigel] (50 Cent)
Big Pop, of the Prop on deck
Versace or LV's on the specks
My Gucc Los light up the ground when I step
Look Beat It! The kid ain't mine I contest (OWWWWWWWWW!!!!)
I suggest, you aim above neck
The vest cover the chest the pine cover the Heck-ler and Koch, I don't rock for the cops 
Horse with the stick in the hands of the jock
Everyday gear that I wear on the block
Can you picture me rollin? (*Can you see clear like Pac?)
Who shot ya!? Who want beef with Big Poppa
Feel a thousand deaths when I drop ya
I feel for you like Chaka Khan I'm the don
Make niggas talk through the wire like Kan
A trip to the morgue turn a duck to a dime
You can catch me on my shit, stuck to a grind
On a mission, tryin to turn a buck outta dime
Or in the kitchen, tryin to turn a fuck outta nine
Nigga listen!!! I earned every buck that was mine
I ain't never cry over a fuckin dime don't make me go off!!!

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I know it's them again from last time remember them 
They can't believe we back up in the club (We back!)
Because you sippin on that Henny and my bitch will get the Semi 
And you fuck with me I'm 'gon let it off (Uh huh, yeah)
I go off! Off in this bitch like it's legal a nigga move around with the eagle
I go off! We say you get it if we don't believe you
This is 50 Cent and Beanie Sigel! I go off!

[Verse Three: Beanie Sigel] (50 Cent)
First gear pop the clutch, second gear throw it up
Third gear I'm on stuck
Fourth gear I'm at Twelve O'Clock
I know I probably get it in, twelve a block
But it's price to low some I'm scared to cop
Guns a blow, and I ain't scared to pop
I know niggas upstate doin life in the box
I know niggas upstate doin life with they pops
It's the bully whether you like it or not
The chain cool but you don't look right in a watch
So give it up smooth, yeah or the rifle'll pop
We'll get you some shoes, probably look nice in the box
Flow smooth, light on my feet like Heav D
Money Earnin all day but I ain't from Mount V (YEAHHHHH!!!!)
Just threw a bell on the scale of the tree
I don't know make 'em two hundred every pea
Without rap I could double on a D
Shittttt!!!! Make it snow in a blizzard like Jeez (AHHHHHHHH!!!!!)
You don't know a naan 'nother like Sige
You don't really wanna see me in the streets don't make me go off!!!!

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I know it's them again from last time remember them 
They can't believe we back up in the club 
Because you sippin on that Henny and my bitch will get the Semi 
And you fuck with me I'm 'gon let it off 
I go off! Off in this bitch like it's legal a nigga move around with the eagle
I go off! We say you get it if we don't believe you
This is 50 Cent and Beanie Sigel! I go off!

[Outro: 50 Cent]
I'll give you somethin to talk about (I Go Off!!!)
Come around me frontin I'll air you out, I go off
YEAH!!!! YOU CHANGED MAN!!!!!
YOU LET THE MONEY CHANGE YOU JAY!!!
YOU USED TO BE, FROM MARCY NIGGA!!!!
NOW YOU A PASS THE GREY POUPON ASS NIGGA!!!
YOU DON'T WAN'T THE SHOOTERS!!!! (I Go Off!!!)
I'LL TAKE 'EM!!! 
NIGGA YOU FEED THE WOLVES AND THE WOLVES FEED OFF YOU!!!
EAT YOU ASS ALIVE! I LIVE BY CONRAD'S CREED, STRATEGY!
