Ay, ay who dis is
My girlfriend
Ay, ay who we talkin' bout
My girlfriend
Ay, ay who dis is
My girlfriend
Who dat is
My girlfriend
Ay, ay who it is
My girlfriend
Ay ay, check this out

[Chorus]
I said I weren't gon never hurt you
You said you ain't gon never hurt me
We lied

Little melt
how could I do this to myself
I lied to her
and plus I lied to myself
Nothing's left
The relationship done lost its breath
It stopped breathing
it died last season
I think about you leaving
cuz you a sexy little creature
Thought I was lying
when I said I ain't fuck Alicia
And I don't wanna hear what Mika said
and fuck Keisha
I betcha they'll fuck me
all you gotta do is leave us
Make you out a believer
we some grown ass people
Dem bitches get on my nerves
that's why I be smokin' reefer
First we start arguing
then I open up my ether
When I open up my ether
the shit gets deeper
At first you start throwin shit
then you start bowin shit
Running round hollerin'
tryin' guess bout who I'm hoein' wit
You know who I'm goin' wit
I be there when you doin it
I done hit the do' no latter than one in the morning

[Hook]
Man
it's been a long spin loving this woman
At first we was in love in the beginning
it was strong then
Now you talkin' bout you don't want me
well gone then
If we don't get along
why we talkin' on the phone then
First I walked out
now you want me to come home then
You said we would stay together
why the fuck am I alone then?

[Chorus]
I said I weren't gon never hurt you
You said you ain't gon never hurt me
We lied

Look man this shit killing me
I'm reacting like Willie B.
Beatin on my chest
Y'all niggaz ain't feeling me
Cards you dealing me
I'm like
What the fuck is you givin' me
We both got injuries
now we play religiously
Same hoes hatin' on us
numbers they be slipping me
You rippin me
you temptin me
you thought that you was clippin' me?
I knew you got them stacks when you took em
I knowed instantly
Left the shit for you to go shopping
to get some Bemanes
You acting like a enemy
Why the fuck is you hittin' me?
Hoes tellin' lies to you
Why aren't you defending me?
Now I'm finna cheat
now I'm finna creep
Now I'm finna have different women in my V
Why
She lied on me
Why
Fly homie
Fuck working it out
I'm finna go and ride homie
Now I'm sleeping here
creeping here
bout to spend a week here
Guess who I'm fuckin' round with
that bitch Keisha, yeah

[Hook]
Man
it's been a long spin loving this woman
At first we was in love in the beginning
it was strong then
Now you talkin' bout you don't want me
well gone then
If we don't get along
why we talkin' on the phone then
First I walked out
now you want me to come home then
You said we would stay together
why the fuck am I alone then?

[Chorus]
I said I weren't gon never hurt you
You said you ain't gon never hurt me
We lied

I'm fuckin' round wit Keisha
ain't no passion though our mansion gold
Rock, Rap, Classical
Benz color pistachio
They love me I'm more into V
Game international
Me and Nick go 26
great grand national
I love her
I ain't said shit
I don't know who to share it with
I'm talkin' bout my girl
this who I be breakin' bread with
Dread shit
selling dro
she never let the feds know
This house I'm in used to be full of love
but where it go
Man I wanna let it go
I love you cuz I said so
I cheated and regret it though
I let my cousin Tres know
Told me get a thousand roses
plus seven more
We would never hurt one other
that's what we said though
We lied gone and say it, folk
We miss each other extra though
But guess what I can't get out my head
guess what we said, folk

[Chorus]
I said I weren't gon never hurt you
You said you ain't gon never hurt me
Ay, we lied

[Hook]
Man
it's been a long spin loving this woman
At first we was in love in the beginning
it was strong then
Now you talkin' bout you don't want me
well gone then
If we don't get along

First I walked out
now you want me to come home then
You said we would stay together
why the fuck am I alone then?

{Chorus}
I said I weren't gon never hurt you
You said you ain't gon never hurt me
