[Madd Kapp]
DJ, what's up, I'm Madd Kapp
The baldheaded honkey who's runnin the beer tab
Every bar down river they hate me
But they made me, the reason that I'm so damn crazy
I keep it movin like section 8 housing
Pissin people off even worse than price gougin
"White boy, you know me baby~!"
I suffer the brain pain, I done lost it lately
Rappers talkin out the side of they neck
So fuck 'em all, I don't need none of your respect
I'm a star dawg, like it or not
Cause people pay attention to me when I'm up in they spot
Pop pills, wash it down with whiskey
Cause that old No. 7 always gets me tipsy
To all the ladies in the bar, I'm ready
Gather 'round me, let's all get dirty and sweaty

[Chorus]
May.. I.. have.. this.. dance.. bay.. bee..
Let's just dance with the devil in the pale moonlight tonight
Sing this song with me

[Madd Kapp]
Hennessy and some Gran Marnier
They call it, gasoline and the buzz is great
I'm too, pisted, twisted, and dis shit
got me goin cross-eyed but I'm feelin terrific and
people lookin at me whisperin shit
Excuse me, I ain't tryin to bother you bitch
I just wanna have some fun and drink some
151 rum earl and get dumb
Pop my collar while I'm cuttin a rug
But wait a minute, I'm white, I can't dance, that's fucked up
That's not fair man, poppin and lockin
Yo fuck it, gimme all your wallets and watches
And while you at it all the chains and charms
Tell the cops I'm in Vegas at the top of the Palms
And tell 'em bring some duct tape and rope
Cause there's a party in my pants and the hoes on dope
AH-HA~!

[Chorus]

[Madd Kapp]
Clear the floor for Captain Disco
Let go of my cape, it's - I said let go
I repeat bitch, I said let go
Don't force me to lash you and call on Metro
I'm with Treba and we're low on petrol
And the red bomb citizen keepin it retro
So keep it clean B, cool and collective
I don't wanna have to pull early, respected
And keep the bouncer out my face tonight
I got a club in my pocket and some gas in a pipe
So stop blowin my buzz you killjoy
And tell that motherfucker up in the booth we still boys
Hand him this, tell him play this disc
This Madd Kapp shit dedicated to the chicks
Report to the dancefloor, shake your asses
No glow sthicks, just fake tits flappin

[Chorus]
