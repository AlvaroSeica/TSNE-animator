Typed by: @Cale_Sampson

[Chorus]
It feels good to be where I'm at
I've worked so hard and everyone knows it
Now that I'm here, there's no turning back
Even against odds, I'll always go for it

[Verse One]
Ever since I first said testing one-two
Mic-microphone check, as a keen young dude
It sparked something inside, so I begun to
Write lyrics each night, âtil my dream comes true
If you've been listening, you would see some do
Especially when you consider what I been done through
They said how could record labels ever sleep on you
You stand out in the crowd, just like a neon suit
I think the government has a refund due
From always taking our money, when they need some loot
Like bailing out crooked companies will lead one through
This economic hardship, I'd like to see some proof
I've had so many visions I've seen come true
When it comes to my music, nothing you see's untrue
I'm undefeated like New England when the season's through
And every goal that I set, I know can become true
( Cuz' )

[Chorus x 2]
It feels good to be where I'm at
I've worked so hard and everyone knows it
Now that I'm here, there's no turning back
Even against odds, I'll always go for it

[Verse Two]
If you want to get the album go to Itunes
And download, then go to the mall and buy two
Nowadays I kind of feel like a tycoon
Who can be successful at anything I try doing
Had some amazing times with my crew
Try to imagine being flied to
The other side of the world and getting to rhyme to
Thousands of fans who stand behind you
It's an unreal feeling that strikes you
Could easily cry from happiness inside you
Exactly what I imagined since Nine dude
Practicing rapping in front the mirror in my room
You understand why I'd be content if I died soon
Against all odds I've overcame and I rised through
There's nothing anyone can say, I paid my dues
I'm basking in my glory now, eating Thai food
Always been humble, kind of guy who
You can walk up on the street say what's up and hi to
But mind you, if I ever decide to
Do another album, it'll be sicker than swine flu

[Chorus x 2]
It feels good to be where I'm at
I've worked so hard and everyone knows it
Now that I'm here, there's no turning back
Even against odds, I'll always go for it

[Verse Three]
The difference is Cale's always rapped with a purpose
Most of these other cats get trapped in the circus
I'm extracting curses, spitting facts in my verses
Getting political, if the subject matter is urgent
News on television's attacking our nervous
System, turning us to some passive observers
A war's going on, with Iraqi insurgents
And North America's losing all manufacturing workers
Sometimes when I'm rhyming, you'll feel this magic occurrence
Of me describing a moment that's actually happening perfect
Somehow every time, exactly the words fit
Cuz' I see the big picture and were just scratching the surface
Leader of the new school, back at your service
Transforming large groups of people back to converters
Rapping since the third grade with everlasting endurance
And I can honestly say every last bit has been worth it
( Cuz' )

[Chorus x2]
It feels good to be where I'm at
I've worked so hard and everyone knows it
Now that I'm here, there's no turning back
Even against odds, I'll always go for it</pre>
