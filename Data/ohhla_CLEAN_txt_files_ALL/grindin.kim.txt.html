[Intro]
This my nine to five
Still livin how that I like
Grindin makin money {*4X*}

[talking over Intro]
Shit was all good just a couple years ago
Ha ha, Birdman, featuring Lil' Kim, Nicki Minaj
It's called "Grind and Get Money," let's go

[Lil' Kim]
I grind all day gettin money
Damn it take all day to count the money
I'm in the freezer, neck full of icicles
I'm a dime, you other chicas need a nickel
Who dat in that Phantom - Kimmy!
Or maybe in that Maserati or that S-150
Or in that Bugati, you can't fuck with me
I do this for my niggaz on the grind
There'll never be another me, what you out your mind?
I get it poppin when it's money on the line
Damn near dropped a house on my wrist for the shine
Louboutin, Fendi, Dior all the time
I snitched in the Louis store, yeah I dropped the dime
Got Baby and Big Daddy Slim on the line
The way that we ball, some sayin is a crime
But we don't really care, I continue gettin mine
Cause this my nine to five

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
All day, this my nine to five
Still livin how that I like
Grindin makin money {*4X*}

[Birdman]
Yeah, just like that brotha
Shinin in the do', CM.. B
Back on my stunna shit, flyer with a extra clip
Flyer in the new whip, ball hard the matchin whip
Keep my shorty with me shit, make sure she flip that shit
Ride around deliver shit, get some of this money shit
Hustle all the time and she shine when we hit the bitch
Ball in the club every night like we do this shit
Uptown soldier, known high roller
Brought her tour overseas, now she all over
Hurricane hit that bitch, now we had to do that shit
Bounce right back in my hood with some new shit
Everyday sunshine, keep my tool all the time
Blowin out the pound, everyday the money on the grind

[Chorus]

[Nicki Minaj]
Yo, aiyyo, eenie meenie miney moe, I'm pi-pi-pickin hoes
to pucker up and kiss my ass under the mistletoe
Yes I am about my cake, just call me Entermann's
I keep a gentleman, first nine Benjamin
Don't mess with Washington, don't mess with Abraham
Patty cake, patty cake, better get the bakers man
Frosted Flakes is on my fingers Fruity Loops is on my wrist
Fruity Pebble, Barbie pendant, don't forget to ice my kiss!
Now where my girls at? That stack money
That Young Money, that Ca$h Money
I work the red carpet, you CLEAN the red carpet
Go get your vacuum, don't you get me started~!

[Chorus]</pre>
