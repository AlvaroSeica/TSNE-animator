[Chorus]
It's on right now
Kingdom people bring it on right now
We should get together
cause it's on right now
Let all the people know it's on right now
People get ready
*Bring it strong right now
 
[Enock]
Let's see, let me address you like a package
There's a disease you might not know you've contracted
The fact is you can track this with no track list
Check the way you get better at sin with no practice
Though we laugh it's not funny when we ask if,
You're going to heaven and you say, "Yea, I'm Baptist"
Perhaps this rap is a way to get at this
An up-to-date, God honoring way to combat this
An even you can eat this meat, it's lean cut
I'll make it plain like M&amp;M's without the peanuts
Study Scripture, and you can see there's a muddy mixture
Saint's with aint's and both paint an ugly picture
Of the Savior---you know you paint with your behavior
Salt's your flavor, you're supposed to shake what your Father gave ya
In the streets so men can peep your godliness
We're cities on a hill so if you're saved it should be obvious
 
[Chorus]
 
[Enock]
When a believer sins you better believe it's in contradiction
To his divine commission and his God given position
It's hard pickin' the Christians their living like the planet is 
Real scandalous like Jerry Springer panelist
Time to switch the channel it's 
the God who can handle this
He'll unscramble this, He knows the game like an analyst
It's sad that we say we love God yet the bad acts
The world does we do too, and God gets a bad rap
Has that caused you any pain, if not I ask, "Why?"
"The world's better!"  You mean you believe that lie?
When you're not living right you're giving Christ a "black eye"
When you love the world you're having an affair like a black tie
Times are dark like a black sky
But the Son's light can still shine bright at night like a cat's eye
That's why as sure as bats fly every rap I
Do will have Jesus as Lord, Savior and Rabbi
He coming fast black, He came once, we've passed that 
Keep that on your mind like a flashback
You should have your bags packed
get out the maze like a lab rat 
Keep your eyes on Him and take them off of the NASDAQ
 
[Chorus]
 
[Enock]
To the true Christian would you listen
You need renewed vision, we've got to rise like a school's tuition
It's a Good News
mission, but guess who's missing
You and me claiming to be in the pool fishin'
What's this? Afraid to go where rough is?
Bust this---we've got the same Spirit that gave Peter his toughness
Plus this is what our Lord did when He touched us
Took a human frame and the He came where the dust was
I know you heard He got mad bloody and dirty
Laid His life down 3 years after He turned thirty
Then got up.  Three days later the Savior shot up
Now you and I can get the Savior's product
I said He got up 3 days later the Savior shot up  
Now you and I can get the Savior's product
Life and a pardon from sin
Chillin' with God with no end
Like life in the Garden again
Enough!  Stop talkin', start provin' your with it
Don't bluff - Start walkin' like moving your pivot
 
[Chorus]
 
[Bridge]
We've got to hold our ground 
Even though the world is getting colder now
The Spirit gives the power to get bolder now
Remember God's chosen you're a soldier now  </pre>
