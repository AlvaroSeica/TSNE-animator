"Where did you go..." --&gt; The Sapphires

[Verse 1: Lil Rob {Moox}]
Hey homeboy, where you been
Where's that loc-ed out Mexican
Mexican-American
So sick, he need medicine
Hey homeboy, where'd you go, are
You still D-I-E-G-O, or
Hidin' out in Mexico
Need to come back with the flow, like you did before
Let these vatos know
What you bouncin' now, a sixty-four
You still roll a Cadillac
Never mind that, holmes, we need you back
Hey, where'd you find yourself a girl
That really turns your world upside down
Well, if that's true, that's cool, me too {"So tell me" --&gt; The Sapphires}

Hook: Moox {Lil Rob}
"Where did you go, I wanna know (I wanna know)" {I wanna know}
"Where did you go, I wanna know (I wanna know)" {Where did you go}
"Where did you go, I wanna know (I wanna know)" {I wanna know}
"Where did you go, I wanna know (I wanna know)" --&gt; The Sapphires

Chorus:
[Moox] "Where did you go" --&gt; The Sapphires
[Rob]  That's what they wanna know
[Moox] "Where did you go"
[Rob]  Where did Lil Rob go
[Moox] "Where did you go"
[Rob]  That's what they wanna know
[Moox] "Where did you go"
[Rob]  He's lost, just like his flow

(Verse 2)
Hey homeboy, you ain't right
You're no longer spittin' tight
You should just put down the mic, what
Happened to your Crazy Life, hun?
Why you lay it low
Make it everything for radio
Like if that's the way to go
Don't forget about the barrio, holmes
See, you still spit it like
Like you had an appetite, don't
Do it like you used to do, need to
Do it like you used to, fool
Why you holdin' back
Need to come back with some oldie tracks
Bring my old school homey back
Where'd you go, hit Rob, what's up with that

Repeat Hook

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 3)
I just been kickin' back (Kickin' back)
With some of this, and a little that (Little that)
Tryin' to get my life back on track (Yeah)
Cause my life is way more than just to rap (It's a rap)
I'm working to get it right
Won't put down the mic, but will change my life
So that's where I went, and that's where I been
But I'm back again

Repeat Hook
