It's no surprise, I overslept
Put my boots on, and climbed out my tent
I didn't see you, assumed you were sleeping
Immediately start a fire, 'cause it's freezing
I can't believe you went camping in the cold
I'm in the wilderness standing in some snow
A late start, but we can still catch up
You need to wake up, we should eat and then pack up
It's when I noticed your footprints
The snow's fresh and those has been put since
What? You already up making the rounds?
So where you at now, you laid back down?
The breeze came and ?stalled? out the frame
While I went to your tent and called out your name
You didn't answer, so I opened up the flap
It was just an empty sleeping bag and your backpack
I'm looking at your tracks and you took a couple of laps
Round the camp ground and hoofed down the path
I think that you'll return, no concern
I'ma hold put and try to make this cold wood burn
The wind is blowin' strong and it's rollin' on
What's going on? At least a half an hour you've been gone
It ain't right, start the paranoia
I left the camp site to go search for ya
I read the trail your feet made
Each step was deliberately placed
It looks like you know where it leads
But I see nothin' but leafless, frozen trees
About a quarter mile into the course
And another set of tracks appeared next to yours
From the north, it came out of the thick woods
And those footprints belonged to a big wolf
Tried to find service on my cell phone
I felt alright with my knife on my belt tho'
I hope the wolf is intimidated by you
I wondered if you even knew it was behind you
Stalking ya, maybe watching ya
Waitin' for the opportunity to hop on top of ya
Salivatin' want to take ya to the stomach
In the cartoons you would have turned into a drum stick
And it gets about as bad as it goes
'Cause I notice there's a new set of tracks in the snow
I understood, it doesn't look good
Your fan-club doubled and now you got another wolf
And the odds are in favour of the home team
Why did you walk off all alone, where're you going?
It ain't the right time to complain, but
It feels like I'm trying to find your remains
Your footprints grew further apart
I knew what that meant and it was hurting my heart
And then you started to run, so I did the same
Now my breath's looking like a steam engine train
And suddenly your tracks skip off of the path
And so did theirs, so my knife I grabbed
Into the forest, expect the worst
Adrenaline burst disturb the nerves
50 yards in to the woods and ?brush?
It got so thick that it looked like dusk
The air stood sereen, sober
Seemed like a good fifteen degrees colder
And I'll admit, hell yeah I felt fear
The sound of my heartbeat was all I could hear
Lookin' at the snow, it was plain and clear
There was a third set of wolf prints where yours disappeared
I can't process, I don't follow
It'd be easier to believe that you was swallowed
But no sign of death, no sign of struggle
No signs of blood, no signs of trouble
And the wolves never stopped, the tracks kept going
And I took off
So I don't know how your story ends
But I know I'll never go into those woods again

It's not that tragic, it's not a shame
You're not the hunted, you're not the aim
You're just another dog with hunger pains
I was so afraid that you'd become the game

I forgot to worry about what you became
You're not the hunted, you're not the aim
You're just another dog with hunger pains
I was so afraid that you'd become the game

It's not that tragic, it's not a shame
You're not the hunted, you're not the aim
You're just another dog with hunger pains
I was so afraid that you'd become the game

I forgot to worry about what you became</pre>
