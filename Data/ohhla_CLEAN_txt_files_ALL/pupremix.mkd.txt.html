Typed by: Lil Hustle

Oh..

[Hook: Ronnie Spencer]
Come on baby, power up with me
Cause y'all already know, the melody
I'm feeling so high, off this extasy
Mike D, D-Reck and D-Gotti
(One two, ready or not everybody's bout to drop
Bout to drop, bout to drop, bout to drop)

[D-Gotti]
Come on up power up pack, feeling like the Mack
Cocoa slim on my back, niggaz show a bust attack
With a sack of hydro ponic, him satin on silk
My conversation is crucial, hoes relying on a pimp
Throw the door man a dub, must of been accident
I usually pay the door, fuck the club
Snub on my waist, body rocking to the bass
Sipping OJ and rolling, jaws locked like a safe
Some got a shank, some playas in the place
I need a shop that ain't scared, to put dick up in her face
I'm like man hold up, this budda off done got a nigga fiending
For weed something, somebody roll something
And uh, I feel like I can float
At Matches on Sunday, trying to give a lonely hoe some hope
And it's dope, she'll never get a feeling like it better
She like Gotti you exit, I'm like bitch that's irrelevant

[Mike D]
I still enter the do', lit the fuck up
Blinding like light shows, moving in slow mo
Gon off Henny, mixed up with Hypno
I call it Crip Cruttical, down it it feel incredible
Oh my, I feel my pelling kicking in
I'm, so damn high
I'm seeing twins now, look here lil' mama
Work it in the britches, bout to break something with your switching
Got me rock hard, sticking out a few inches
Gotta pinch me, I feel like I'm dreaming
Jenny and her twin, talking bout tag teaming
Yeah yeah, I'm just so damn thoed
When I'm on that X-O, yeah yeah come on uh

[Hook]
Come on baby, power up with me
Cause y'all already know, the melody
I'm feeling so good, off this extasy
Mike D, D-Reck and D-Gotti
(One two, ready or not all my playas pull out your drop
Pull out your drop, crank up the knock
Uh-huh, 3-4-5-6
Pop you a tab, and jump in the mix
Jump in the mix, jump in the mix)
Ain't nothing but a power party
(Uh-huh-huh, 7-8-9-10
If it's kicking in, gon down that Henn
Down that Henn, down that Henn)

(Ronnie Spencer)
Ain't nothing but a power party
Come on baby, power up with me
Come on baby, power up with me
Rocking and a shocking, to this melody
Come on baby, power up with me
Rocking and a shocking, to this melody

[D-Reck]
It's on, what's happening my nig

[Mike D]
I'm back home, trying to get my hustle on
Now D-Reezie, how you feeling my nig

[D-Reck]
Still explicit, trying to make my paper flip

[Mike D]
Just don't stop, and stack it on up
And watch lil' mama, out there back it up

[D-Reck]
I'ma hit it from the back

[Mike D]
I'ma hit it from the front
On three large tabs, and I'm bout to get crunk
I'm pulling through the lot, and I'ma pop my trunk
Pull out my nine, and I'ma buck-buck-buck

[D-Reck]
Yeah buck-buck-buck, that's how a nigga act
Once I fall up in the club, I'm headed straight to the back
Where you can find me, and my nigga Mike D
In the VIP, powered up on three
Three lovelies, and them hoes going hard
But I ain't talking bout the pills, I'm talking bout three broads
You know the fun ones, that carry the condoms in they purse
Freaky make it easy, for a nigga to get the skirts
For a nigga to get the skirt

[Hook]
One two, ready or not all my playas pull out your drop
Pull out your drop, crank up the knock
Uh-huh, 3-4-5-6
Pop you a tab, and jump in the mix
Jump in the mix, jump in the mix
Uh-huh-huh, 7-8-9-10
If it's kicking in, gon down that Henn
Down that Henn, down that Henn come on baby, uh-huh</pre>
