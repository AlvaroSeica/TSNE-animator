Money B speaking:
It's time i'm lettin all you busters know you better ride to this here
ya, this is one of them ones that had to get done
if anybody get offended by what I'm sayin,
I'm probably talkin bout you anyways
but it ain't about that. it's about my dawg
They can't kill you dawg, I won't let you die
and I remember what you told me. you said:

Chorus:
The aim is to be major paid
with game sharper than a mutherfuckin razorblade
So keep your eyes on the mealticket (mealticket)
so get your money nigga, let's get richer real quicker
The aim is to be major paid
with game sharper than a mutherfuckin razorblade
So keep your eyes on the mealticket
get your money hustler, let's get richer real quicker

1st verse:
Got fools askin when I'm gonna do a song for my homey
like my feelings ain't strong for my homey
It didn't take long for my homie to start sewin it up
throwing up the westside here, blowin it up
A real rider, thugged out to the corner
A lot of fools hated him cuz he was doin it hot
You think I'm talkin bout you?
you better check that tattoo
On your chick thigh,fool
Ride or die,fool
Now all these fools
wanna make a career of the next man's hits
Ridin his tip, makin songs bout pac
Sayin it's outta respect
but if it's outta respect,
Then give his momma the check
cuz she made him
and he sure made you
you like humble (??), im watchin everything you do
Come on dog, face it you know you cheatin
If he was still here, you know you wouldnt be eatin
but everybody thugged out, thug this, thug that
Superthugs to the fullest, imagine that
You one dimensional,
claimin you the 2nd comin and its unintentional
My homey, i wish you was here so you could see these lamers
How these fake djs tryin to be in this game
You know, your real loved ones miss you dawg
When you fell, you took the west with you dawg
for real

Chorus

You ain't knowin whats wrong
now put your shirt back on
Before Tha Outlawz see ya
and you get your back blown
Ridin to makaveli 3, 4, 5 and 6
with tattoos on they belly
Ridin like they getting shot
All these bad asses suckas he was talkin wit
now that he passed, they kissin his ass
Now, if this shit was the other way around
You think my man Pac wouldn't still be tryin to clown
Now tell me are you sincere for real
Or maybe tryin to pick up West Coast record sales?
Cuz uh, touchin them millions, my dawg was nice
Even B.I. got turned out by thug life (babee)
Now where the hell u think that stuff came from?
Ya, act up if you want
Makaveli tha Don, he was the greatest
i know u hate it, but someone had to say it</pre>
