Yo
I'm only rhyming where the drums is at
Y'all niggaz think y'all slick wit that bullshit bump that
Y'all pay V for flowing to the beat
Not for what he know that got hoe's hoeing in the streets
That's for him to know
And for they to never find out
About the kidnap, blind fold, and the blind mouse
The coroner report say he simply signed out oh
And I know
Y'all wanna see a wino bring the wine out
Cat wit a dead mouse is how he catch the phrase and pause plays wit it
Kill it
And eat off it for days kid it
Who ever ain't get it ain't supposed to
For standing still close to
Bandits will ghost you
No shoot Sherlock
I don't know how they do on your block
Out here we rock on to the sure shot
Shit still ain't stop keep it on till your peeps is gone
We be on the creep no matter what you keep it on
CD whop

Peep
Catch the beat to ridiculously
People think he study levitations true mystery
How to power an envious scallon till he got him for his sweet 16
He said Ed be wilding
Rumor has it things got violent
He clobbered him and broke the fuck out
But he ain't try to rob him
I told her don't tell your man that's the trouble with these chicks
Next experiment
Twelve strands from double helix
No
I haven't seen Kess Felix
Oh yeah
You stay away from her with those lyrics
Please
Aint nobody fucking after her
I'm out of here as soon as I fix the flux capacitor
N O N and speak to V in a proper manner
before he stabs ya and put out all type of proper gander
Stop the slander
Chop the hand of a thief
And cut the mouth off of who ever comes out they teeth

V sell time to an inmate
And then tell him a rhyme for the hell of it to demonstrate
They know who's the renown beat critic
Do a street lyric like that's a neat trick
Off on a tangent
He ain't got a cent
Supposed to go to management and spent it getting bent
Sparky
I had enough of your malarkey
For one don't mark me and who you calling darky
Agitate in the dark</pre>
