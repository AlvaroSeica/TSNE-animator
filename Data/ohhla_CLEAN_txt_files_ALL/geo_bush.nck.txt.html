[George Bush]
My fellow Americans, good evening
tonight I would like to finally talk about an urgent issue
that's been near and dear to my heart strings
some time ago, Kanye West, said that I hate black people
nothing could be farthest from the truth
but Kanye, if ya want beef, ya got beef! bring it in!

[speak, beat comes on]
I heard yous was talkin shit boy!
I hear everything!
I could make ya disappear!
hahahahaha!
your beatin 'round the wrong bush
read my lips, ill kill you

[Nick]
you don't want it from the president, hell naw Kanye
you don't want it from the president, watch me spit my flows
Its george dub [yea], and I'm runnin shit
Kanye west don't know who he fuckin with. (me!)
run up on your block havin your crew get to duckin quick
shit about to blow up keep my finger on the button bitch!
you gotta problem, do somethin then
no bloodz no cripz, its the fuckin republicans!

[George]
katrina wasn't my fault
I didn't even know there were black folks in new orleans
west wing!

[Nick]
you don't want it from the president, hell naw Kanye
you don't want it from the president, hell naw Kanye
you don't want it from the president, mothafucka stay away!
Kanye we don't play, Kanye we don't play, Kanye we don't play
little west you don't really want beef
your a whack rapper, I'm commander in chief!
say I don't like blacks but no one believes ya
cause everybody knows I'm squeezin condoleezza
I hit it from the back and I rocked her world
now I'm leavin her ass for a white girl

[George]
yeah! I ain't no lame duck, hahahaha! you don't say? bring the hook in!

[Nick]
you don't want it from the president, hell naw Kanye
you don't want it from the president, hell naw Kanye
you don't want it from the president, hell naw Kanye
you don't want it from the president, mothafucka stay away

[speak, "Kanye We Don't Play" in background]
I'm gon smoke you out!
and I ain't sharin my bitches
I'm from crawford bitch! straight out!
don't be a hater player
don't make me call in dick cheney!

I'll tap your phone son!
geroge w. bush, dirty south!
watch your back Kanye!
terror alert is elevated!
Ahh!</pre>
