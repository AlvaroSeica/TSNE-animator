[Big Punisher]
Tired and relieved cuz he alone?

We ain't got Artist of the Year, Rhyme of the Year
Grammy nominations cuz we're fat or blind or nuttin' baby
(Yup, yup)
Aight? All night  (All night)
Playin' this out my way
All night long, all night
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo (Come on)

You priceless, you like diamonds, I'll ice your wrist
He got chedda, Im twice as rich
Make you bite your lips
Jenny, dju know that dju likin' this
I used to think you ever leave me, Id slice my wrist
Treat you like a bitch, never that (What?)
You got beef, where my niggaz at (Yeah, yeah)
And the street's where I'm living at

[Fat Joe]
Clitter clack, that's the sound of the Mini Mack
Where we at, uptown where it's really at
Gimme that, I want the mansion and yacht
Advance on the spot, we can dance 'till we drop
Am I handsome or not?

[Jennifer]
Joe, you the Don

[Fat Joe]
Jenny, you the bomb
Any man disrespect, good as gone

[Jennifer]
When I opened up my eyes today
Felt the sun shining on my face
It became so clear to me
That everything is going my way
I feel like there's no limit to what I can see
Got rid of fears that were holding me
My endless possibility
Has the whole world opened for me
That's why 

1 -	I'm feeling so good
	I knew that I would
	Been taking care of myself like I should
	Cause I don't think anyone can bring me down
	Nothing in this world's gonna turn me around

Now the day is turning into night
And everything is still going right
There's no way you can stop me this time
Or break this spirit of mine, oh no
Like the stars above, I'm gonna shine
Anything I want will be mine
Tonight I'm gonna have a good time
Call a few friends of mine
Cause I'm loving life
And tonight's for feeling

Repeat 1(2x)

[Big Punisher]
Boricua, that's you mamacita
Puerto Rican diva from La Isla Bonita
Let me freak out on the dance floor
Be your mentor
He determined to get your pants off

[Fat Joe]
That's the last straw
Pun I ain't got a glass jaw
Better run when you see me coming through the back door
Cracks wrong, I give it all for my brother
There's two things I don't share
That's my money and my lover

[Big Punisher]
I know money's just for caring, that's for real
Take's cash to live
You love her? Better scrap, for real

[Fat Joe]
Shut up your grill
You know we never fight
It's your world girl, set it off right

Repeat 1(2x)

I'm feelin' so
Party on tonight
Everything is feelin' right
DJ 
(Let's dance, come on)
(Let's dance, come on)

Party on tonight
Everything is feelin' right
DJ 
(Let's dance, come on)
(Let's dance, come on)

World's gonna turn me good

Repeat 1 until fade</pre>
