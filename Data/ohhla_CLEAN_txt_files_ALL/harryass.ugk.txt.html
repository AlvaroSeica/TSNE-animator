[Chorus: Pimp C]
Got a young brown stallion and she 20 years old
When she pop it from the back you see the hairy asshole
Got a young red stallion and she 20 years old
When she pop it from the back you see the hairy asshole
Got a young yellow stallion and she 20 years old
When she pop it from the back you see the hairy asshole
Got a young white stallion and she 20 years old
When she pop it from the back you see the hairy asshole

[Pimp C]
Uhhh; you can shave off your pussy, you can wax your shit smooth
But if you do bitch then my dick'll never move
You hoes in the game but you bitches is lame
because you don't know the score - you a stupid ass hoe
I'ma show you what's the deal, you need a fo' inch cone
So you can get your money right, get your fuckin paper on
Cause the tricks in the street, they wanna bury they piece
in a whole bunch of hands, eat a bitch derriere
+Pimps Up, Hoes Down+ like the fuckin movie says
All these other motherfuckers talkin down them bitches dead
I'ma show you what time it really is in the South
Young girls gettin paid puttin dicks in they mouth
You can suck on my nut but you ain't never gon' break me
Cause these other motherfuckers don't know they can't shake me
I'm the real, you a motherfuckin faker
I got these bitches on the tracks sellin tricks they money-maker

[Chorus]

[Bun B]
Well it's Big Bun Beada A.K.A. ya big daddy
Comin down in the big body Benz or the Caddy
I'm smokin on the fatty, filled up with the good
Grippin on the grain drippin stains in the hood
The leather and the wood, pretty lady made of chrome
Comin down on the poles, gettin my shine on
So when you see me leanin on the buck with the stitch
Hide yo' hoe, cause I'm probably finna fuck wit'cha bitch
So when I bend the corner with my playa ass persona
Put my pimpin game up on her, guarantee ya she's a goner
Easy for you to get her but it's harder to keep
When that real pimpin hits yo' boulevard on the creep
Now nigga you can beat 'em or put dope in they nose
But see it won't even matter, I'm finna scatter wit'cha hoes
Don't hate the playa, hate the game, you know how it goes
Now go on and keep it pimpin and send me the bitch clothes

[Chorus]

[Webbie]
Ay let me get on this one, this my kind of music
You heard me?

Well excuse me, let me introduce me
This champeezy got me leanin in here like a G
Every time I come to P.A., I hook up with B
And we smash up the H-Town for some bad B's
Purple trees so believe I'ma get my chief on
20 thousand dollar mink, they thought I was Sweet Jones
Red-bone, pretty thong, she done got me feelin on
A milli' strong, clear as stones, man a nigga really on!

[Lil Boosie]
I got a bad yellow bitch, when she bust it back it's pink
Her pussy hair softer then the feathers on my mink
Fresh out of school, ball up in this, young and super fine
Taught her how to rub my nuts when I fuck her from behind
I ain't lyin, she a dime and she be 'round all them bad hoes
She like it when I rub my hands cross her asshole
Pretty brown, pretty face, pretty toes
She a stallion and she stay on all fo's
lookin back at me

[Chorus] + "asshole" echoes to the end</pre>
