[Lucky Luciano]
(Verse 1)
Come one, come all, it's playa made, we do this here like everyday
Hypnotic bottles and tanguaray, fillet mignon stake on my plate
It's paradise for a young playa, my Johnny watch stay on glare
Got a swimming pool built upstairs, no baller blockin', it's lovely
I smell like money and talk shit, don't like my style, get off dick
And press stop, turn it off quick, cause 'round here, we ballin', bitch
And they grade me, strictly told me that I would nevermind me nothin' (Fat bitch)
Now who's taking Benji' callings on TV screens, God damnit, Lucky
Jet skis
Palm trees
DVD's, six CD's
Spendin' G's on diamond teeth, then hotel suites in Miami beach
Ha
Take a look at me, now
Bling, blaow, girl, you wild
Take off your clothes and get naked now, I pimp up pimpin' and say it proud
Open wide, give me brain, don't forget to give me my change
Pimp my shrimp, rub my feet
When you done, holla my name
Now get upstairs and take a bath, and shave ya legs and the coochie too
I'll be waitin', jammin' Screw, smokin' weed in my swimmin' pool

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 2)
I'm ballin' boy and lovin' it, all 'round my neck, got somethin' sick
It ain't my fault I fucked ya bitch, she cooked me food and served my dick
Left ya kids at her mama's house, then came, jumped on a baller log
No problem, mayne, can these ballers bop, come on, mayne, I'm off the lot
Chrome shine, grill blingin', candy paint and wood grain
TV screens and leather chairs like a living room, I fuckin' swear
Tryna steer, she saddled up and rolled the dome 'round the six-10 loop
Skeet, skeet, through the rubber, hot, I dropped her off, boy, I'm a fool
Zipped up my 'Sache jeans, then proceeded to hit the club
Hit the lot and turned heads, then got 'em all like what it does
Next, snap, when I walked in
Playa Made Mexican ballin'
Braided up with a diamond grin'
Crystal, Don P and a bottle of Hen'
In the V.I.P.
Gettin' gone
Look at these hoes all on my bone
Fuck puttin' nothin' but in my phone, just get in your car and follow me home
Two o'clock and the club's closed, but this party just began (Biotch!)
3 A.M. we at the crib, come off your clothes, went enterin'

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 3)
And I'm iced up
Lookin' clean, Lucky got the sun on his team
Big Franco on my bezle chain, get a close up of that pinky ring
You never seen no Mexican with blue diamonds on his teeth
And you never seen no Mexican talk a stripper out some jeans
Better up that ladder, try again, it's hard to reach my status
Ain't no chance at this cat ballin' off, I rather keep on laughin'
I be stackin' like no other, buster call me Master Yoda
I'm space age and I'm playa made, young famous Saviola
Creased jeans and new jays, somebody stole my Screw tape
You want this spot, but too late, I got this here and oooh, man
It feel good, I'm forever throwed, my Benzo two days old
Ten G's and I rock a show, wake up, then put on my Versachi robe
Ordering off of menus with a bunch of bubba price food on them
Floss in a brand new breezy and she sure look like she model
Ain't no dollars I can't call, you ain't got it, go on and walk
I'm two times to the left, three times to the right, then open up my ball

Repeat Chorus Three Times</pre>
