[Chorus] x2
You never was a killa; you never bust a gun
You never held the spot down; was never on the run
You never lived my life; you deadin' it wrong
Cuz you never did none of the shit that you said in your song

[Verse 2]
With the strength of a hundred baboons
I'll beat your eyes black as a fuckin' raccoon
Leave you covered with stab wounds
Dead in a public bathroom
You like to tighten your face and cuss when you spit
Know what I noticed? That tough shit is just when you spit
I couldn't picture you bustin' a clip
I could see you suckin' a dick or prolly getting' fucked with a stick
Drama with me, son, your baby momma will be
Found in the woods, hangin' by her thong from a tree
You spit my life and want an award
But you can't get my stripes cuz you the type to run in a war
Slung jums in front of the store; done it before
Held guns, I'm talkin' at least a hundred or more
Should put a gun to your jaw, to one of your whores
Fuck under the covers; we all lovers under the floor

[Chorus]</pre>
