[Intro]
So I woke up, I went downstairs to the kitchen
Pulled out the thing of milk, some of that lactose-free shit, heh
Pulled out one of them big-ass bowls from the cabinet
Got me one of them big-ass spoons, and uh..

[Rapper Big Pooh]
This is kettle-pot rock, we eat it with a big spoon
Tupperware bowl, stick a fork in your tune
Let it marinate, don't give it to 'em too soon
Wash my entr√©es down with a Blue Moon
This ain't a high-school-after-class flow
Even if I make it look easy, that's me though
Yeah I need dough, think I can't bake
You ain't never seen how a nigga make cake
This is food for thought, get a plate
When you seated at my table never say you ain't ate
or at least been served, I don't do hors d'oeuvres
Buffet style, I don't take orders
So get enough, get full, take it to the crib
Share some witcha peoples or lil' kid
When it's gone, just remember how Rapper did
Gotta eat like this to live, c'mon

[Chorus]
Deep-fried download, sweet production pie
Peas in the iPod, side of RJ Rice
Mash Madlib, smoke some of that killa
Good food, good grooves, that's how a nigga feelin

[Rapper Big Pooh]
This is crock-pot gumbo, in it for the fun yo
I got love for it even when my funds low
Drive slow, approach a verse with caution
Bars lined up and they ready for marchin
King of the hill, liquor no pills
En Vogue at the moment, this is +Something They Can Feel+
Somethin they could steal, slippin on a peel
White Ts', black Chucks, that's me on the real
Ready set action, plenty traction
Never see me sweat young'n, no satisfaction
I hear 'em axin what's ya next move
Anything I choose, Vol. 1, Vol. 2
Fat Boy Fresh nigga, live from the Shopp
+Chopp+ two peas, make it harder to stop
Only got one goal: make it harder to drop
That's a message to the old heads and the new crops

[Chorus]</pre>
