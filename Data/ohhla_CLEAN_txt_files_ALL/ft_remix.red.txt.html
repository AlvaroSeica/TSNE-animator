When I shine, you shine, we shine forever
(This is the remix baby girl!) (*SHAKEDOWN!!!)

[Verse Two: Red Cafe]

Doorbell ringin I'm a heat it at the buzzer
She wanna tear the mall down threw her stacks quick
Ask her address she holla Sak's Fifth
You a lady boss (Yeah!) Now you fly free (Yeah!)
Put you in Jimmy Choo and you ain't even Chinese (What else!)
Mixed cocktails shaken not stirred
With her head in my lap how can I not swerve?! (Believe that)
Shorty thick got Cleveland Cavs (AHHHHH!!!!)
So much class double d's and ass (What else!)
Super fly, opposite of basic
Of course you got haters mama you on the A list

[Chorus: Trey Songz] (*Red Cafe) (**Wale)

[Verse Three: Wale]
First class seats, bottles on me
We gettin chicken but these skinny models won't eat
No days off and I ain't gettin sleep
'Cause when I get my money right, I'm 'bout to O.D.!
I shine, you shine, so we shine
I'ma show you why that ring finger need a peace sign
Yeah, since I was a knee high
Bein fly was something that's in my Levi's
My genes/jeans y'all, my DNA's what I mean y'all
'Cause I be all, three or more for them PRs'
So peace shawty, but Ci-roc had that peach in it
And err'ything at ease, you in double M-G presence 

[Verse Four: J. Cole]
Hey, you ain't heard, a nigga like me
Been around the world twice, sippin iced tea
Come with me, to Madrid, that's where we all play
Quit the job baby, come and fuck me all day
You see my, lifestyle's been nothin but life styles
Late nights and early flights, rushin right now
But she - gotta, have that, grab that, what's that long
Auto-matic, cut that, flush that, gone~!
And I don't wanna be a playa no more
Huh, okay I'm lyin but I'm tryin
They say that money talks, and bullshit walks
Have amazing conversation while we flyin, I ain't lyin

[Chorus: Trey Songz] (*Red Cafe)
When I fly, you fly, we fly together (We fly! Fly!) (*BELIEVE THAT!!!!)
When I shine, you shine, we shine forever, baby (We Shine!) (*WHAT ELSE!) 
When I fly, you fly, we fly together (*HUH!!!!) (We fly! Fly!)
When I shine, you shine, we shine forever, baby (We Shine!)

[Outro: Red Cafe]
Hey baby! Welcome to the wonderful world of that Shakedown!
You gonna call up your friends, I'm a call up my friends, we could all be friends!
Shit we could do this every weekend! J. Cole! Wale! Trigga Trey!
And none other than that Red Cafe!
You know all I do is count money and touch honeys!
Regular shit! Somethin like! It's that Shakedown life why not!
HUH! </pre>
