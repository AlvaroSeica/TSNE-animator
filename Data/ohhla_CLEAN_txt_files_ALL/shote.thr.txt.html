[Threat]
Shote, shote, broke, shote
I used to have the fat sack of dope
Bugged, off that herb, straight to the curb
Damn I took a loss how much that shote dawg costs
Remember the hoe from Hawaii?  Got me in a twist
Coconut swallowin trick, she need her ass..
.. hoe want half, like I don't know math
Yeah trick, watch yo' ass, and I'm convinced
you got the dawgs, all on my balls, on my drawers
Tax man's comin out my ass like Jaws
Nickel to my name, pistol to your brain
Super skanless, Rolex bandit
For the ones that helped me take my loss - give it up
Now they gotta break mines off
And just make it payable to Mr. Unfadeable
Ol' {?} don't know how to break a hoe, BITCH
Cough up them food stamps you tramp
Big daddy need him some new Fosgate amp, but you don't hear me doe
Such a macaroni, she don't even know me
Took some naked flicks of the bitch, sent them to my homies
Cause I'ma bust one for him him and him
Bust one for you, and me, too
Show you how to clown these hookers
Come out the pocket with that knot and what else you got
I want the diamonds, the pearls, no fat girls
Want some skinny legs don't go see Jenny Craig
Come see me, donate a small fee
No home robbed for free
Kick in, open up your mouth and put this dick in
Lookin through the purse, too too bad it ain't the first
Nothin but a sack full of change and a fake-ass gold chain
Bitch get yo' broke ass out my house {*door slams*}</pre>
