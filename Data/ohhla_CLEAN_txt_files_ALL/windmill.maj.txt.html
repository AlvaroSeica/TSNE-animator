[Madam Majestic]
On a circle in a spiral, Like a will within a will
Never ending or begining, On a ever spinning wheel
Like a snowball down a mountain, Or a carnival balloon
Like a carousel that's turning, Running rings around the moon
Like a clock whose hands is slipping, Past the minutes of it's face
And the world is like an apple, Floating silently in space
Like the circles that you find, In the windmills of your mind

*instrumental*

[Madam Majestic]
Like a tunnel that you follow, To a tunnel of it's own
Down a hallow to a cabin, Where the sun is never shown
Like the door that keeps you open, You can dream the way you dream
Like the ripples from the pebbles, Someone tosses in the stream
Like a clock whose hands is slipping, Past the minutes of it's face
And the world is like an apple, Floating silently in space
Like the circles that you find, In the windmills of your mind</pre>
