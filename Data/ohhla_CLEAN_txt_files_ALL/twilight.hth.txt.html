[Pressure]
The door breaks, my world wakes, light ascends my windowpane
An hour goes, I'm showered though I'm struck by hunger pain
I break my fast fault, makes the glass translucent through the rain
From my dining room, Tom and Sue got me late again
I snatch my papes, lash for tapes, the sand hills, the plains
Cars biting lines, arrive in time to hear my name
Roll call feeling like my old school again
There's tags on the desk, the day drags on the brain
Time's up! I head for home, the sunrays and then rain
As twilight hits my eyesight I jump the train
The town is for my sound, that's why I came
I step to the jam, a figured silhouette, it blocks the doorframe
I announce my toiling(?) to a bouncer acting lame
Said, "I came to entertain", yeah he's asking for my name
Man act like you know it's all the same
With attitude he's grabbing dudes who step through to hear beats playing
I'm in this past, I'm in the grass with some drunk and he's saying
He likes the way I flow and what's the way to go in this game?
I told him "There's many paths, just use your heart and your brains
Another day's another hangover mate ain't nothing changed"
Then Next is on the decks, time to catch reck, the crowd's swaying
Masses part, a flashing spark sends light from a chain
Flickering a sticker in, a guy's kicking them game

[Suffa]
In my B-Boy stance, cause my B-Boy's saying, "What's up Dan?"

[Pressure]
Hand shakes from my mates from Hilltop
Ain't seen em' in a while but I knew they still rock
The freestyler's in a cipher rhyming to a Beatbox
Because we came here just to blow up the spot
Now feeling parched, looking for a laugh, I stray from the flock
I hear a loud and familiar sound of twisting the top
I see my mans at the bar drinking scotch on the rocks
Take a look at my watch, *Man it's almost 12 o'clock*
It's time to rock, the venue's getting full, it's getting hot
It's time to blow up the spot, regardless of props or not
Make my way to the stage, Debris stops me on the spot

[DJ Debris]
Dickhead's is starting beef, Dan they fully lost the plot
Do not if you care or not but some fella got clocked
I knew his face but not his name, he was pissing blood and snot
Matt's out back, practising raps getting hot
But fuck it, let's do this show

[Pressure]
Sit Baz, they bother me not

[Suffa]
They bother me not, they bother me not, what?
They bother me not, they bother me not, what?
They bother me not, they bother me not, what?
They bother me not, they bother me not, I say...

[Bridge - Pressure]
Because I touch everything in my life
Like the sunrays touch everything in the light
until the night descends upon the mind's of men
lose sight in the twilight of life, looking for the limelight
I touch everything in my life
Like the sunrays touch everything in the light
until the night descends upon the mind's of men
lose sight in the twilight - is looking for the limelight</pre>
