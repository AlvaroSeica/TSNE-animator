[Intro]
Yeah, Tony Touch
BK, Here we come boy

[Verse]
I'm still fed the fuck up, Signed now, So What
Crazy Cat, Bad Boy Still get you fucked up
Still rock the chains all night, Hopin' I look up
Or catch me a spic, or a chick, wit a hook up
I got fake credit cards galore
And I'm real sick and tired of being followed in the store
Can't wait to have bitches chasin' me
Can't wait to have a party like Tracey Lee
I make you take your ice off, cuz nigga
I'm pissed off
I'm still drinkin' beer when ya'll are poppin' crys off
Came home, ??Common?? turned a nigga lights off
I gotta buy cheap shit and take the price off
Wipe off that smirk nigga, You ain't hard
You just like me, Besides I met your ??God??
&gt;From the streets of B-K, I don't give a  fuck
Mad Rapper, Crazy cat, and Tony Touch

[Outro]
Word Up, 50 Emcees Boy
This How We Do
B-K Style, Form flatbush to Bushwick Nigga
We get down boy, Tony Touch One Love Baby
Yeah</pre>
