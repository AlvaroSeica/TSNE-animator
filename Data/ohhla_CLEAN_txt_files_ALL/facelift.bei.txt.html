Upside down..
Upside down..
Maej..

Sometimes it seems like the matrix
Takes us, all through the races
And everybody running
But we going different places
And everybody crying
They just fall on different faces
And life is a struggle, everybody won't make it
See I was on the plane with a bunch of white people watching world cup soccer
Man, them niggas going crazy
But if there had been some black people watching basketball
Then we'd be ghetto the motherfuckers racist
It seems the prettiest girls the ones that get the facelifts
They damn doctors bills take they whole life savings
I wonder why do we always wanna trade places
With someone who would trade with us because they couldn't take it
And women post pictures on they page ass naked
And we admire that, niggas treat 'em like they famous
And let another woman come along and try to save 'em
They twist they faces up and they acknowledge that as hating
And times the hardest thing to get back once you waste it
And face it, this life is really only what you make it
They saying "Bei, slow down younging, you gotta pace it"
But you can't concern yourself with standards when your chasing greatness

I know..
Facelifts and Waterfalls... yeah..
Facelifts and Waterfalls... Uh... Yeah..
Pray that

Maejor..
I think it's time to let the water fall
Make it rain everyday 'cause I order ball
New play call it "auto ball"
It's too much banging get off each other's balls
Sipping champagne, way up in first class
Where niggas make their whole year I did the first half
A January and it was cold outside
Niggas doubted me but can you heard me told 'em right?
I don't walk I just fly, I went from once a blue moon to once a blue sky
And old school women love me like that new guy
Got my hat to the side and my eyes on the prize
And you can not hold me down it's like tryna hold water
My generation going dumb I'm tryna grow smarter
Mad that my girl tell her broke friends what I bought her
But her skin so soft man I think she Carol's daughter
Garden of Eden beauty when she's naked
And this life here is only what you make it
So I'm a make sure tonight we do it all
Close your eyes facelifts and waterfalls

... Upside down..
Upside down... Yeah..
Upside down..
Bei Maej..
