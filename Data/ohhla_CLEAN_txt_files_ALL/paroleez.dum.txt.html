[Intro: Dungeon Masta]
Struggles of one mind...

[Dungeon Masta]
I should go on a run right now (I should go on a run right now)
I do not really want to wait (I do not really want to wait)
There's too much pain my heart (there's too much pain in my heart)
That's why I feel so much hate (that's why I feel so much hate)
I do not know what's my fate (I do not know what's my fate)
I do not want to go back to jail (I do not want to go back to jail)
I'd rather die gettin' high (I'd rather die gettin' high)
And get away from this hell (and get away from this hell)
Lord, help me... (lord, help me)
Can you show me a sign? (can you show me a sign?)
Will I ever be okay? (will I ever be okay?)
Or is I'm losing my mind? (or is I'm losing my mind?)
Parole got me by the balls (parole got me by the balls)
They won't even let me live (they won't even let me live)
I should go on a run right now (I should go on a run right now)
I do not really want to wait (I do not really want to wait)
There's too much pain my heart (there's too much pain in my heart)
That's why I feel so much hate (that's why I feel so much hate)
I do not know what's my fate (I do not know what's my fate)
I do not want to go back to jail (I do not want to go back to jail)
I'd rather die gettin' high (I'd rather die gettin' high)
And get away from this hell (and get away from this hell) </pre>
