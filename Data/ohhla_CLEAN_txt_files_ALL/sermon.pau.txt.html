Leaving you on the note that
Knowledge is to know the ledge
Before you fall over the edge
Into the devils so called civilization
Or into despair of ignorance
The difference between that ledge and that edge
Is that that ledge is the tip of the edge
And that edge is the border between life and death
That's all we have left
Shoot skills out your brains before you have breaths
Dom Dom competitor
Be the reverend and also the editor
Etcetera, come better to heat your black ass up like a sweater
To shoot you to the mystical magical man in motion Â– God!
Blends into my skin like lotion
Do this thing all day on the daily swing styles like Barnum and Bailey
Dom Dom drops the bomb bomb keeping it calm calm
