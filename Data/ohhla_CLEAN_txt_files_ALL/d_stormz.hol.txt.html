[Intro: Boot Face]
Yo, Boot Face, the man with twelve faces
Pro the Leader, what up, homey?
Check out the hype shit, yeah, yo, yo

[Boot Face]
I show you how the west was won, no exageration
Fucking ugly bitches, I got lower expectations
I'm un-fuck-witable, basically the greatest
Me and Pro the Leader mix better than crossfaders
Muthafuck you haters, better stay up out of my's lane
We bring the pain, that leaves your head migrained
I'm mic-nificent, I spit the shit that's untamed
Two masked bandits holdling up the money train
My connection runs deep like a fat girl's veins
Impregnate the game with the Boot Face in your slang
Buckshots at your man, miss, then I hit your dame
We literally insane, I'mma say the same thing
I'm pushing and shoving just like my dog main
Fuck the fame, I'mma stay underground and hard headed
Only murder worthy beats, you MC's stay on pathetic
I'mma disconnect you homey, like you wearing a prosthetic

[Pro the Leader]
You're in for the ride of your life, take in consideration
Face you at elimination, is he and the Europe administration
Rightful heir to the throne like Great Gatsby and
Ask me when I started rapping I'll give you an honest surprise
Surprised? I don't know why, they false to follow lives, hip hop didn't die
The rivalry revived, the armory arrived, artillery inside
I need a shipment of beats with equipment
Then destroy your speak, you finished
You don't know the half, work gon' have to underground your family rapper too
Act a fool, Weapon X and Boot Face, thanks for coming through

[Weapon X]
All thank to write these pages, we came straight through the changes
Different stages, survive the paces, I'm dangerous to the traders
You embarass yourself with arrogance, stay violence to see talent
My intentions are not violent, one rhyme leaves you damaged
The forever Weapon X will see an increase in ignorance
Until the day of death I will fight with sworn justice
Plus fame will disappear when Pro the Leader engineers
For the listeners to hear and benefiters sincere
And adjusting my surroundings, most wolves are hounding
The fact that's often doubt, every edge is being counted
We make underground music, to let you hear the exclusive
I'm mass part won't make 'em lose it, you learn science for the movement
Won't keep us concealed, cuz we speak what we fear
Now displaying the skills, and continue without a deal
No hydro, this is legendary, my force of artillery
Not a victim of the industry, evil taste the guillotine

[Nova Kane]
Yeah, can't forget the Kane, hotter than some summer rain
The winter can't contain all the flames I've obtained
The airwaves and hallways rising like bears uncaged
Grimy ass grizzlies, my chain be scaring beats, hey
Signed or unsigned, still bring it to your face
Expel rhymes around corners, spill 'em up like your face
Don't ask how it taste, just eat it up quick
You posing with your click, while we posing for a flick
You need to watch your chick, in a top friend list
Mic reps are like crunches, if you trying to get fit
Jive styles, steel blade, kicking like Guile
Lifestyle of a crocodile, always see me smile
Not to be wild, but I had to flip the style
Still rock the argyle, best believe it, child
Keep lusting for the gems, I found a jewel in the Nile
We keep it in the fam, gonna be here for a while

[Holocaust]
Your mind move swiftly through the self destructing planet
Untying a long coat in Los Angeles
Try as they will, try as they might
Who else scratch the mic, won't live through the night
With a taseled axe, I damage, define lining of such a sea shells
Feathers, beads and jewels are kind Spanish
Just in, an explosion tipped over your ship in the Atlantic
Riots rip through the nation, you panic
He once was a king of golden swarm
Locus, the sergeant tan this
In England, the city of London is home to over 7 million people
It would be better if you just leave, man, survival on the mountain
The last hero standing, the last hero standing
The last standing hero, check your local listings when demanding
The badlands kissed you, you have your own New Testament
You won't know what hit you, you're like a humpback whale in the desert
I clean my pistol, Treasure Planet was going to explode my razor rings whip you
A sacred thing, forgive you</pre>
