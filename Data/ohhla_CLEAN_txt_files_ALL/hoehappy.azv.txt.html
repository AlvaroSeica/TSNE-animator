Guy- "What's up AZ?"
AZ - "Maintainin' G"
Guy- "I'm sayin' tough titties somebody gotta suck it, I'm casin the
joint what's up?"
AZ - "I'm sayin' there mad dime bitches up in here though."
Guy- "Let me tell you though, it ain't time to subtract &amp; add on."
Jackie- "How you doin' AZ?"
AZ - "Oooh you definitely thick no question."
Jackie- "Yeah, but it cost."
Guy- "Yo man give me change for a penny, I pay for that, I know who
you is Hoe Happy Jackie."

AZ:
Whoever thought that, that sweet thing born model material
That hated hot cereal, could grow to be a high silly hoe
Really though it's a shame for this damn thing
Cuz everything's brand name
when will she get enough of these damn games?
Struttin' wit her unbuttoned blouse like it ain't nuttin'
Draggin' her wagon, knowin' fellas be flaggin' &amp; frontin'
Hopin, by keepin' her gear, wear, &amp; hair dope &amp;
Some really Big Willie nigga'll dig her and get open
And give her what only a tenderoni would deserve
She got some nerve thinkin' every nigga's a herb
That goes around trickin' on every chicken that he's stickin'
Male of female, whoever cats that need and ass kickin'
Cuz if it's more than one fella tryin' to get wit her
To hell wit the fly, she only sliddin' wit the highest bidder
But if you aks me
She's nothin' but a nasty, money hungry, unclass, Hoe Happy Jackie

Guy- "Yo, son word to mother, let's keep it real, that bitch ain't 
nuthin' but poison man, every nigga that bitch fuck wit
somethin' happen to, she see a pinky ring shine
she up in the nigga mug piece like he handlin'."

AZ:
Check it, this one Jamaican wasn't fakin' wit the bacon
Cuz ever since him, she was on if I'm not mistaken
But then again, this money gettin' Dominican
Caught her when she was fallin' off, &amp; made her win again
Now nothin' can stop it, once she in a nigga pocket
She be seein' more profit, than those livest weed spots get
Makin' her income &amp; then some
Cuz even a weddin' band on her hand, won't stop a man who wanna spend 
some
Diamonds, &amp; furs is all she want, that damned Glamour girl
Lovin' it, out there clubbin' it, dancin' like one of Hammer girls
Happy Jackie the jigga hoe
Her job is to jack niggas doe, I call Jackie the jack a nigga pro
And it's true, count all the fellas she flew through
She even juiced Jack the Jew
Jackie I'm scarred of you
&amp; I remember that '87 September
When she was slima, she was a hoe hoppin' beginna
But now from acne, nappy hair, and gear that was tacky
She's on (She's on, she's on, she's on)

Jackie- "Yo I got that sucka ass nigga."
Girl  - "Ooh yes you do (I'm sayin' though what's his name?)
         That's AZ from the Eastside.  Girl you better work dat ass."
Jackie- "Is he trickin' boo?"
Girl  - "He trickin' (Good), but he got a baby moms."
Jackie- "Yo fuck that I gotta eat his doe thang
	95 I'm gettin' it all 
Girl  - "Yeah go ahead girl."

AZ:
So all the sugar dick, dirty devil dog, slick daddies
Don't get out foxed, and slicked, and turn into a trick daddy
Trickin' ya whore, hustlin' end for some skins
Cuz next you be trickin' on all you family members &amp; friends
She got a way to make ya feel like ya gotta stay in
It's not a way she'll pay, it's bills that she gotta pay
So married or single, watch out for Jackie when you jingle
She might sting you, and ain't no tellin' what that stinga bring you
You could fall off point &amp; get careless
Lose all awareness, go hairless, why she wouldn't care if
You go bankrupt
Her lifestyle's corrupt
So knowledge before your wisdom of understandin' is fucked
Cuz if you ask me she's nothin' but a nasty
money hungry, unclassy, Hoe Happy Jackie

Jackie- "Yo what up AZ?  We out?"
AZ    - "I'm sayin' whatever baby.  Dinner gonna lead to breakfast, 
if it's on you it's all good."
Jackie- "Yo I got you all the way."
AZ    - "Better stop talkin' 'bout it &amp; be about it, word."
Jackie- "Yo my man whip outside, we can leave right now."
AZ    - "You buggin' the fuck out?  What's wrong wit you?  Word up,  
what the fuck you talkin' about?  Bitch, you tryin' to get a          
nigga killed or somethin'?"
Jackie- "I'm sayin'....."
AZ    - "Get the fuck outta here, word up."
Jackie- "I suck ya dick."
AZ    - "Yo, you stupid get the f.... You Hoe Happy Jackie ass bitch.
Yo get the f.... Ayo son, come and get her the fuck outta here, 
ayo get the Mo son we walkin' out the fuckin' club wit that 
shit right now, word up.  Ayo kick that bitch to the back."</pre>
