I'm a dank burner 'cause I'm earnin' some bank
No one to spend it on because I ain't got a mate
so I put it in my system where I procrastinate
playin' games of video, I'm sure that you can relate
I like Hack-n-Slash, FPS, my favorite's third person
Shotgun blast to some brains is my perversion
Mixin' up the herbs, weapon upgrades
use the silencer if that shit's on fade
Reside in a hazy hobbit hole, I never vamanos
My best friend's Papa John and The Noid from Domino's
Sometimes I skip a shower, I smell like a stinky toad
Every console you can think of on the brink of Jericho
I would never buy a gun, I would never take a life
but I'll snipe you in the eye if I see that you're online
I'm a kinda quiet guy 'cause I'm always in my mind
I would say give me a try if I ever went outside

Home alone on my thrown, everywhere I go I own
I'm a troll, packin' bowls, yo, it's in my chromosomes
It brings out the best in me in very scary ways
I've been down with bootin' up since Sierra Games
Home alone on my thrown, everywhere I go I own
I'm a troll, packin' bowls, yo, it's in my chromosomes
It brings out the best in me in very scary ways
I've been down with bootin' up since Sierra Games

Dinin' on some Deep Dish, listin' to Cheap Trick
live this life of chronic, Life Aquatic made me seasick
On my Wii or my 3 or my 3-6
Cross-legged, playin' bongos like a beatnik
I'm gettin' baked with Solid Snake and Ratchet and Clank
Pot with Ocelot 'cause he's got the mad dank
We're drinkin' Sunny D 'cause the purple stuff's rank
We never step outside, sun exposure's unsafe
I'm not a party guy unless it's Mario Party time
I'd rather kill some Zombie Army Guys while playin' R.E. 5
or the second God of War or the first Half-Life 2
Now roll up the blunt with my degree from NYU
I got the game thumb, the basement's the place to be
President's daughter has been kidnapped and it's up to me
In my pixelated palace, there's a policy:
if the world hangs in the balance, you best call mc!

Home alone on my thrown, everywhere I go I own
I'm a troll, packin' bowls, yo, it's in my chromosomes
It brings out the best in me in very scary ways
I've been down with bootin' up since Sierra Games
Home alone on my thrown, everywhere I go I own
I'm a troll, packin' bowls, yo, it's in my chromosomes
It brings out the best in me in very scary ways
I've been down with bootin' up since Sierra Games

"...Do you want to kill a baby?"

Home alone on my thrown, everywhere I go I own
I'm a troll, packin' bowls, yo, it's in my chromosomes
It brings out the best in me in very scary ways
I've been down with bootin' up since Sierra Games
Home alone on my thrown, everywhere I go I own
I'm a troll, packin' bowls, yo, it's in my chromosomes
It brings out the best in me in very scary ways
I've been down with bootin' up since Sierra Games.</pre>
