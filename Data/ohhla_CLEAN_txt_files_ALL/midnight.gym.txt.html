[Intro/Chorus: Travie McCoy]
Ay, ay
After midnight we're out of control
We outta control {*3X*} let's go!
Cause after midnight we let out the dogs
We outta control {*3X*} let's go!
Yeahh, this ain't the +Rocky Horror+ or some sorta, freak show
We're on the border of complete disorder, just lettin go
So when the clock strikes midnight everyone lose control
and let the freaks come out tonight

[Travie McCoy]
This shitty nine to five (man I hate this job)
It's gonna be the end of me (it's gonna be the end of me)
And since when did time (and since when did time)
Become my biggest enemy? (Become my biggest enemy)
I don't think it's smart standing so close to me
(So close, so close - you too close)
Because at 11:59, I can feel it in my spine takin over me
(I-I-I feel it, I feel it takin over)

[Chorus]

[Travie McCoy]
It's midnight, it feels right, everybody's actin other
If you're a freak be proud of it, you got it from your mother
And I have rather good manners I just choose not to employ them
It's about that time for you to embrace your flaws and enjoy them
Everybody in the back, bring your ass up to the front
And nevermind the fuss because we do what we want
You feeling how I'm feelin put your hands up to the ceiling
And say "We don't need no Glocks, let them motherfuckers go!"

[Chorus]

[Interlude: repeat 2X]
I don't think it's smart standing so close to me
(So close, so close)
Because at 11:59, I can feel it in my spine takin over me
(I feel it, I feel it takin over)

[Chorus]

[Travie McCoy]
And let the freaks come out tonight {*2X*}

[Chorus] - to fade</pre>
