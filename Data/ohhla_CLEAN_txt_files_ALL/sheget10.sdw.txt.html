[Intro: Fantom of the Beat]
Grammy nominated, Fantom of the Beat
That's what's up, Specman, y'all, here we go
Sha Gov, come on

[Specman]
First you heard "Magic Stick", now Fantom back with this
J. Specs and a miraculous pitch, Sha macking chicks
Stack them chips, promotion drive to the 1-3-5, you know the click
His head in his dick, slang what y'all flip
Bing style, toothpicks on a poster, now watch it stick
I got you chicks, above average Miss, the one's I can't resist
Looking love in the club, you the shit, you the reason I came to spit
Not a bitch a trick, don't walk around conceited and shit
Be in the mix, main flow, wilding to these hits
While these tricks is in V.I.P. feeding up on dicks

[Chorus: Specman]
You're the girl, that's you
You got it, so go 'head and flaunt it
I want it, I need it, I mean it
I dreamed it, I seen it, I barely believe it
I'm flanking, I'm fiending

[Hook: Specman]
She gets a ten, I give her ten
She gets a ten, I give her ten
She gets a ten, I give her ten
She gets a ten (what you gon' give her?) I give her ten
She gets a...

[Specman]
Girl, you're a cutie, natural beauty
Not too skinny with a nice round booty
Only catching attitude, once a month moody
Speak truly, chill in the lab with a blunt and a movie
Suit me, for real, never beef when I go on tours, she know the deal
And don't hold mine, she gots her own steel
Understand the way I think, move and feel
Deal with the bullshit, bailed me from jail
Hail Sha Gov, see them cheques in the mail
Come to house tours, she sharper than a nail
Make due, or to Allah praying that I never fail

[Chorus]

[Hook]

[Specman]
White like, whatever, blacker, the better
Specs habla espanol, true letter
Asian, amazings, eyeing it, forget ya
Malaysian, Haitian, waiting to sex ya
Specman respects ya, I ain't need a friendship lecture
I just met ya, ease off the pressure
Guess ya, played too many games and it messed ya
Brain, you were feeling the pain, drained and stressed ya
Take ya to Mateo's, let you order Amaretto
Check now, no stress now, I got cheddar
M.T.M. logo, ya could see it on the sweater
Wave them ten cards in the air by my sector

[Chorus]

[Hook]

[Outro: Specman]
Fantom of the Beat, yeah, my engineer Sapon
Can't be beat, straight up and down
I give all a ten...</pre>
