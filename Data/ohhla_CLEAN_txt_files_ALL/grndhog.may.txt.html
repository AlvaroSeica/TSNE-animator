[Chorus: repeat 2X]
It' just the same shit different day
we pretend to work while they pretend to pay
daydreamin' all day after day
every minute, every hour, that I'm spending awake

[Verse 1]
Big city bright lights
Every night roll the dice
Alley cat, walk the strip, lookin for some dynamite
Dirty streets, heroin chic, knuckleheaded types
See the beast tryin to get fed on gangster look-alikes
Moons full wonderful
The way the city glows
Walkin past wannabees frontin like they ain't really broke
Out of towners spending their cash trying to forget their homes
Imitating some lifestyle seen on a video
Living the dream's getting harder as I sleep
So I stay awake blunted pounding the concrete
1-2, you with me?
Cuz  radio don't get me yo my demographics are graphic and labeled risky
Week nights, I notice carry certain kind of vibes
Locals and connections get connected wined and dined
Weekends, the scene continues but the crowd will change
9-5ers blowin they're checks, washing the week away
make it crunk, make it bump, cause im in a rut
get me drunk, Monday come hopefully I'm numb
getting funds never as fun as when your spending em'
hopefully I'm broke as hell when the grim reaper come.

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
It' just the same shit different day
we pretend to work while they pretend to pay
daydreamin' all day after day
every minute, every hour, that I'm spending awake

Let's get buck, raise em' up before the night is up
Speakers blast, people dance, time to have some fun
Get some ass, have a laugh, watch the sun come up
Make it last cause tommorow's back to offices
HuhÂ…That's right, that's right, that's right
All I wanna do is take a load off tonight get high(repeat)

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
It' just the same shit different day
we pretend to work while they pretend to pay
daydreamin' all day after day
every minute, every hour, that I'm spending awake

I used to wake up in the morning and hop on the express
Yellow line Q, headed towards a job with a desk
Workin for checks, walkin asleep, dreaming concepts
Zombie rushin to get a seat before the train jets
Pack em in'
Nice and tight headed downtown to fight
Any and everyone that step in front of my 9-5
Get it right, clock em' in homie yo that's what happenin
Maybe I'm just a robot functioning off of oxygen
My daddy told me it's routine
Feelin a little stuck when you ain't livin your dreams
Right now it seems there's no escape
Feelin so outta place
Got caught in the system on some matrix database

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
It' just the same shit different day
we pretend to work while they pretend to pay
daydreamin' all day after day
every minute, every hour, that I'm spending awake</pre>
