[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Shorty said she really feelin me like YEAH!!! (YEAH!!!) OH YEAH!!!  (YEAH!!!)

She don't know that we goin (BACK TO THE CRIB CAUSE SHE KNOW THAT I'M ON HER!!!)
She don't know that we goin (BACK TO THE CRIB!!!! BACK TO THE CRIB!!!! YEAH!!!!)

[Verse One: Juelz Santana]
She wanna roll with me she wanna go with me
But she don't know I'm tryin to take her back home with me
I told her have a seat in my ride
She said I look like I taste good and she wanna eat me alive
She lookin good in them new tall heels
I'm lookin at her like a full course meal
Chill!!! I got all the girls checkin me
They know I'm a dog but they love mt pedigree
Yeah! Just call me Mr. Orgasm
And if you come with me I guaranteed you gonna have one
The hottest in the hood, the freshest on the block
Why stop all this Gucci and the Louis that I rock?
If not, I stay Polo down to the socks
Rings, chains, and watch worth more than Fort Knocks
Temporary plates on the Audi R8
Diamonds match what I'm wearin she can't stop starin

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Shorty said she really feelin me like YEAH!!! (YEAH!!!) OH YEAH!!!  (YEAH!!!)
Shorty said she wanna roll with me I said YEAH!!!  (YEAH!!!) OH YEAH!!!  (YEAH!!!)
She don't know that we goin (BACK TO THE CRIB CAUSE SHE KNOW THAT I'M ON HER!!!)
She don't know that we goin (BACK TO THE CRIB!!!! BACK TO THE CRIB!!!! YEAH!!!!)

[Verse One: Juelz Santana]
OWWW!!! Runway walk, beauty queen face
Video body see the curves and the shape
And everything her mama gave her she know how to shake
Thicker than a milkshake and I'm tryin to get a taste
Hair did, manicure, pedicure
Attitude like Vivica, when she played in Set It Off
She feelin my swag, she feelin my G
Not only is she dancin she feelin on me
And I'm feelin you too, so I put my hands on her
Just to let her know the feelings mutual
No mama we could birthday text
Yes I said text but I know you know what I really meant
Tell me what you will do, tell me what you won't do
Tell me what you don't know how to do so I could show you
I'll give it to you give it to you like I owe you
And after I'm done I'm a tell you I told you, so

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Shorty said she really feelin me like YEAH!!! (YEAH!!!) OH YEAH!!!  (YEAH!!!)
Shorty said she wanna roll with me I said YEAH!!!  (YEAH!!!) OH YEAH!!!  (YEAH!!!)
She don't know that we goin (BACK TO THE CRIB CAUSE SHE KNOW THAT I'M ON HER!!!)
She don't know that we goin (BACK TO THE CRIB!!!! BACK TO THE CRIB!!!! YEAH!!!!)
Shorty said she really feelin me like YEAH!!! (YEAH!!!) OH YEAH!!!  (YEAH!!!)
Shorty said she wanna roll with me I said YEAH!!!  (YEAH!!!) OH YEAH!!!  (YEAH!!!)
She don't know that we goin (BACK TO THE CRIB CAUSE SHE KNOW THAT I'M ON HER!!!)
She don't know that we goin (BACK TO THE CRIB!!!! BACK TO THE CRIB!!!! YEAH!!!!)
