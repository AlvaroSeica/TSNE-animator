[Intro: Snoop Lion &amp; Chris Brown] (Chris Brown)
When it's over now, nothin left but the enemy
When the show goes down, and you silence the melody 
(Is when you say! I be that) Soundboy, inna L.A., rudeboy inna Kingston
Badboy, inna England, New York, the whole kingdom

[Chorus: Snoop Lion &amp; Chris Brown] (Chris Brown)
I ain't got the remedy, don't wonder that from me you see I'm ready see 
I'm livin in a sin that's how it's gonna be
I heard a boy sing say that they would die for me die for me die for me

[Verse One: Busta Rhymes]
Wa da da ding! Wa da da dong ding ay!!!
When mi come inna di dance oonu know mi haffi mash it up again! Ay!
Wa da da ding! Wa da da dong ding!!!
And you know we would never never never stop beat them 'til the end
Siddung on top a di riddim and kill dem and give dem anodda one afta
Seet deh! Right away anyway nobody else do it propa
When mi and mi bredda Snoop Lion meet it's blessin, love and honor
Two a we a par and di two a we a eat now yuh know seh di whole a we a prospa
Newsflash, lit a little ash, every website and blogga
Snoop and Bus in the studio bangin out hits eat a little bit of snappa
Don't ever get it twisted see we gifted when together
Reincarnated Snoop Lion Selassie I forever!!!! 

[Chorus: Snoop Lion &amp; Chris Brown] (Chris Brown)
I ain't got the remedy, don't wonder that from me you see I'm ready see 
I'm livin in a sin that's how it's gonna be
I heard a boy sing say that they would die for me die for me die for me
Somebody help me wake up, and make it rain on my head
Let it rain, let it rain, let it rain on my head
Set me free, so complete, everything must come to an end let it breathe

[Verse Two: Snoop Lion]
(Top selector number one Snoop D-o double g aka Snoop Lion!)
When the background clears, and your the one left standin there
Your runnin out of time, you prayin that you make a hiss
Whatever they do, whatever they do to y-y-y-y-you!
Whatever they say, whatever they say to you you better 
Sound off, inna Paris, role call, inna Lebanon
Bandeleros, inna Mexico, can yuh hear mi, di whole kingdom?!

[Chorus: Snoop Lion &amp; Chris Brown] (Chris Brown)
I ain't got the remedy, don't wonder that from me you see I'm ready see 
I'm livin in a sin that's how it's gonna be
I heard a boy sing say that they would die for me die for me die for me
Somebody help me wake up, and make it rain on my head
Let it rain, let it rain, let it rain on my head
Set me free, so complete, everything must come to an end let it breathe</pre>
