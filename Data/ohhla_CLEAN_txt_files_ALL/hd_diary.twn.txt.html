[Intro]
Yeah man.. Twin Gambino man..
This gutter, part four, hard shit man
We here to let y'all know, this shit is real
Yeah.. whut?!

[Verse 1]
Time to take it, but we are gettin ready for the end
Always stay with my heat, never trust a friend
Then stab you in your back and smile up in ya face
I'm like Bin Laden, nigga that's hard to trace
Plus a race, what do you know I'm all up in ya face
Grim Team droppin bombs, vest in the place
What up, when you see Big Twin you better get up
and salute, cause I'm the top dog in my crew
Plus I'm gifted, young as fuck with two biscuits
I need like, thirty blunts to keep me lifted
We live by the minute, the flashy cars we get it
But what's kinda worse, I'm fuckin a fat chidick
Ya best to believe, she playin with major figures
Gambino, Grimey One, know I'm that nigga
Hard like DMX and smooth like Jigga
Thug from QB, you know I'm that nigga

[Hook]
"Twin Gambino" --&gt; Nas
"is holdin it down" ... "Queensbridge"
"If you want the problems, we can hurry up and come bury ya"

[Verse 2]
You think shit sweet, talkin like you got heat
Until I bust you in ya face with this Old E (BLAOW!)
This O.G., tryna tell me to slow down
Before I go down, shit I can't see that
I'm goin all out, trigger til I fall out
Blue steel on my hip, that's how I roll out
I never worry 'bout, me gettin aired out
Twin don't care about, what you done did kid
I'm in Queensbridge, rollin with them gangstas kid
You tryna front, and watch you get splashed kid
You never heard about shit like that
Pumped crack all my life, and I might go back
Only one thing savin me, this shit called rap
I can't go back to jail, it ain't for me
And I'll prolly get shot down, by the police
Then I'm tryna take 'em out, with the big heat

[Hook]
"Twin Gambino" --&gt; Nas
"Is holdin it down" ... "Queensbridge"
"If you want the problems, we can hurry up and come bury ya"
"Forever standin my ground" ... "Queensbridge"
"If you want the problems, we can hurry up and come bury ya"

[Verse 3]
It ain't a game on this side, I seen people die
Babies havin babies, and that's no lie
My third eye, keep me to stay on my toes
And my pops always tell me keep my enemies close
Four one seventy-seven, day I was born
And my moms couldn't believe, it was two little boys
It was Jamaica Hospital, first place I seen
But I never thought I'd be writin rhymes up in the bing
For servin a fiend, just tryna make a little cream
So I can get the new Jordans, like my whole team
My dreams, were shattered cause my brother is gone
Had to wake up, realize: life goes on
