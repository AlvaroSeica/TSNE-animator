[Big Daddy Kane]
A rap pro, do a show, good to go, also
Cameo Afro, Virgo, domino, I go Rambo
Gigolo, Romeo, Friday night spend money on a ho-
Bound to grasp, Samurai, on what they call each other
Erasing all errors, get worked to pall bearers
I'm talking caskets, coffins, I'm the bastard swordsman
That cause the loss of massing organs
Fear factor, here after, disaster
Climb like the stairmaster, coming through, clear a path of
The raw aggression, that'll take your best on
You start talking tephlon, then you switch to Revlon
Nigga, choose ya weapon, hope you got your vest on
Talking Superman shit, when you ain't got ya S on?
Heh, get ahead of who never, your skills too technical
Leave nothing left for you, but residue, the state of vegetable
The mad swagger, do flaunt it, my dick and you want it
Only question now, is "nigga, who want it?"
Cause once trouble said (like that) trouble dead
Boy, don't make me have to pull out this double edge
A rap pro, do a show, good to go, also
Cameo Afro, Virgo, domino, I go Rambo
Gigolo, Romeo, Friday night spend money on a ho-
Tel, to get a good night's sleep, I'm keeping in step
Do I come off? Yup

[GZA]
My sword crash through your breastplate, splash the blood on your scared face
Drops leave your trail in the snow, showing the clear trace
Behind a punctured steel, they bodies rot
Arm and leg missing, head laying near the chopping block
An experience, that shattered ya spine, break spirits
Same shit that fucks with ya mind, you hate to hear it, nigga
Def man world is silent, he hears nothing
But we punish those who play dumb, years bluffing
Floods and bloodbaths, up on elevator shafts
Many rivers choke and body will float it like raft
Spark wires from auto-fire, verbal and slang with gats
Screws filled with casualties, wherever the tanks was at
Conflict iminent, prelimenary attack
Everyone's a target, so cemitaries are packed
A solid nigga, drink liquids and gas you up
Hit you with a stupid flying drug, then pass ya cup

[Chorus 2X: Suga Bang Bang]
Why, you trying to test me swordplay, when I'm sharp in every way
This life I live, I'll do it, all by myself</pre>
