[Intro]
Talk that talk to me yeah {*2X*}

[Jay-Z]
I be trying to chill, bitches wanna fuck me
Every little city I go, fuck me
Shorty musta heard, got the word, I move that D
Had it by a bladder, she like "Oh I gotta pee!"
Hahaha~! Ran into a rocker in my restroom
Singer slash actress in my bedroom
Gotta have the ticket for a walk-through
Everything I do is big (yeah we talkin)
I talk big money, I talk big homes
I sell out arenas, I call that gettin dome
Million dollar voice, came through the phone
We headin to the top if you comin, come on
I'm flyin out to Pisa, just to get some pizza
Fly down to Jamaica, just to roll some reefer
Sex on the beach, left love speechless
They say that money talk tell these other niggaz speak up
Whassup?

[Chorus: Rihanna]
