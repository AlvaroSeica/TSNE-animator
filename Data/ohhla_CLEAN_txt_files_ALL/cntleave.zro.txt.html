[Hook]
I can't leave drank alone
It got me fiending, (leaning feeling good
Feeling like a boss, while I'm flipping through the hood)
I can't leave drank alone
It got a nigga fiending, (I ain't even gon lie
This drank, got me feeling like I'm walking on the sky)
 
[Z-Ro]
Ya'll would think after three felony cases, I would leave drank alone
But I'm still out on bond, and I'ma keep dranking until all the drank is gone
Damn right I'm high as the sky be, over G4's and G5's that's where I be
But then it's back to reality, cause I can hear the sirens damn HPD right behind me
I got a lil' weed and a pint and a half, but thanks to Don I got a stash spot
Since my doctor wrote me this perscription, ain't nobody gotta bond my ass out
I'm still rolling in a three double O, with my name in the grille on top of fo's
And I'm in love with Mary Jane and coedine, I don't love these hoes
I can remember my first cup, ooh I was so in love
So when I wake up in the morning, before I brush my teeth I'm po'ing up
Lil' mama you a dime piece, but I'll fuck you up if you touch my cup
Cause it ain't cheap as it use to be, and this one cost three hundred and fifty bucks
Me and DJ Screw po'd up a pint, on my 22nd birthday
And that day was a monday, but a nigga didn't wake up until thursday
I handle my bidness, so I think I deserve to get throwed
So I'm a bar baby now, just like my nigga Big Moe

[Lil' O]
Sipping on a skeet taste, headed to the weed place
These boys think they ball big, they should see what we waste
On pints of the drank, zips of the dro
Cup so muddy, told you bitch to hit it slow
Top down on 59, you know I'm tipping slow
I can hear H.A.W.K. saying, (man you tripping O
Slow your ass down baby), but me I'm like fuck it
I got money in my pocket, and tonight it's going down
Cause you know, I like sipping on that purple stuff
Purple kush in my 'gar, taking purple puffs
Any bad bitch in the city, wan' flirt with us
Got killers on the team, to put in work for us
We some down South bosses, and we stay po'ing up
Ask about O, man I stay showing up
If I see a two liter, man I gotta fo' it up
If you wanna ride with winners, then you better roll with us
Cause we be, sipping on big drank daily
Yelling to the haters fuck you pay me, Lil' O and Ro we don't play G for real

I can't leave drank alone
It got me fiending
I can't leave drank alone
It got a nigga fiending</pre>
