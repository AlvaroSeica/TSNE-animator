[Wiz Khalifa]
And they say they ballin' but I do it how the pros do
Where we goin next? we gon let my hoes choose
No socks and my boat shoes
Guess a nigga eatin good like whole foods
Not a couple cameras now they bring the whole crew
Bad bitch ride wit me so she 'pose too
See me and my guys like a plane flown through
Hella high roll up weed up like I'm supposed too
And now I'm into big things
On the building you need to know the tenant rate
Gettin paid still ridin no shirt
Let a bitch give me brain call it home work
Niggas try hatin' on 'em but it dont work

[Chorus]
Alota shit done change
New clothes new car, new things
Sayin boy they used to be at the bottom
Came up thats what they say
Used to not be allowed in the building
But now we on the roof top
Used to not be allowed in the building
But now we on the roof top

[Wiz Khalifa]
Slow money just better than gettin' no money
Learn to get good show money, that's yo money
Get comfortable with it, really know money
Rich nigga shit, that really goes for me
Self made nigga, well played
I'm on the plane drinkin' champagne and lemonade
You tryna copy whats done, I'm tryna innovate
And club owners getting tired of tryna ventilate
BIG MISTAKE
I'm too busy finding places and trips to take
The more I smoke the more money my business make
Remember they used to be like who is this?
Now, I'm up in this bitch, they light up like independance day
When you around the real, you keep it real everyday
My niggas keep it real, so I hear what they say
Either you getting paid, or you paying to play
Either you on your grind or you stay out the way

[Chorus]

[Curren$y]
Uhh, just made a million, got another million on my schedule
The pick up on my Ferrari, you jets or you jetless
You niggas aint help us, on second thoughts you did
They hatin was the fuel for this shit 
So you wrote your own check off a hoe ass
Sweatin bullets at home, wonderin if she coming back
? and she she can smell it on ya
Thats why you only see her when you buyin stuff for her
We was sneakin in then it was general admission
Now we own the arena decidin who allowed in it
My windows aint tinted, pimpin, I aint trippin'
Had showered that shit, I'm just ballin' and chillin
We plooted this out, one night in the city
Now we Los Angeles, medicine cabinet twistin
Our habits are expensive, we gotta have it
Twit-pic'ing when we get it and they mad at us
Fuck them niggas

[Chorus]

[Wiz Khalifa]
Alotta money, lotta luggage, lotta hoes
When you puttin in work, thats how it goes
Alotta money, lotta luggage, lotta hoes
When you puttin in work, thats how it goes
Alotta money, lotta luggage, lotta hoes
When you puttin in work, thats how it goes
Alotta money, lotta luggage, lotta hoes
When you puttin in work, thats how it goes

And if the kids tryna be like me, they probably smoking bout an O
Oh, aint my fault though!</pre>
