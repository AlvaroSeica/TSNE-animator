[Chorus 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I know a lot of people that smile in my face
But talk behind my back every time I'm gone
So when they call my number I don't ever pick up
I don't owe you shit bitch, leave me alone
I'm going big, suck my dick
I'm going big, suck my dick
I'm going big, suck my dick
I'm going big, suck my dick
Too many niggas, not enough hoes
and some of you niggas acting like hoes
Stay to myself like loners do
Get high by myself, I'm not in the mood
to politic or be fake with you
We apologize if you ever knew
Too many niggas, and not enough hoes
and most of you niggas acting like hoes

[Kendrick Lamar]
Everything I do is turelem now
I'ma take my time, I'ma master it
You should be mindful of a mastermind
Put a land mine right where your momma live
Now blow up, blow up
Hold up, I've seen your kind before
You see me as a dollar sign
till I resign on your report
that I done you wrong
And I'm in the know, my homie never
Nigga right now, it's now or never
Nigga right now I'm high as ever, but however

[Chorus 1: Kendrick Lamar]

[Kendrick Lamar]
Everybody heard that I fuck with Dre
and they wanna tell me I made it
Nigga, I ain't made shit
If he gave me a handout I'ma take his wrist and break it
Nigga, I'm faded off of that Nuvo
Chilling with two hoes in here
and they tie my laces
Living the Matrix as them pills disappear
Me and my niggas just acting bad
HiiiPoWeR conglomerate
Living that life and counting this cash
Old friends I no longer have

[Chorus 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I know a lot of people that smile in my face
But talk behind my back every time I'm gone
So when they call my number I don't ever pick up
I don't owe you shit bitch, leave me alone
I'm going big, suck my dick
I'm going big, suck my dick
I'm going big, suck my dick
I'm going big, suck my dick
Too many niggas, not enough hoes
and some of you niggas acting like hoes

[Schoolboy Q] + (Kendrick Lamar)
Yeah, I remember when I came out and shit
Man it's been so long since they seen my dick
Probably been five months since I've seen my seed
Goddamn it K. Dot, when it come to this?
When I was sleeping on couches
Nigga couldn't get a call, just a Glock for my belt yeah
Nigga I was motherfucking out yeah
with the flashing lights, had me stuck like Reindeer
When I should've been bank yeah
I was somewhere stuck with a flame yeah
Motherfucker, see how far that I came here
Went broke and I came up in the same year
Can I get a hell yeah?
Uh, drop my chair, hold my joy, show my pride
(Music saved my fucking life
 I'm doing right and you left behind
 Feel my pain, now I'm styling
 Hear this shit, I spent a thousand
 Different homes, different islands)
Dropped my mixtape and it sold like an album
Reason why I'm

[Chorus 3: Kendrick Lamar]
I be going big, bitch suck my dick
Yeah I'm going big, bitch suck my dick
Tell 'em I'm going big, bitch suck my dick
Yeah I'm going big, bitch suck my dick
Too many niggas, not enough hoes
and some of you niggas acting like hoes
Stay to myself like loners do
Get high by myself, I'm not in the mood
to politic or be fake with you
We apologize if you ever knew
Too many niggas, and not enough hoes
and most of you niggas acting like hoes
