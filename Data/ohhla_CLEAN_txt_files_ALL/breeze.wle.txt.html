Typed by: AZ Lyrics

George: *coughs* I got the will power
Elaine: Oh, I don't like this one bit!
George: *coughs* I can't stop now! I'm addicted!

Cool as a summer breeze
Pimping is nothing to me
Roll up the purple and breathe
Sit back and roll up the weed
Them niggas be talking but them niggas is nothing to me
Who here is fucking with me?
It's not a discussion I be
In my own class bitch I them cold raps
I fuck the world and fuck yo girl and give em both an orgasm
Leave yo show canceled
Leave em with no answer
The master of my domain
Yes I am no Costanza
First I had potential
Now I got them answers
I'm smoking on that voodoo
And that's word to Papa Shango
Cooler than a fan circulatin
When they dancing in my face if I get one chance, I'ma take it
So, Lord forgive me for my indirect sinning
Am I cheating on these women if I'm getting naked pictures from another, a lover
I want her but lemme be 100
See, monogamy's redundant
Sometimes you find the one
Sometimes you give it up
Sometimes you buy the ring with no problems
You in love
Sometimes it aint whassup
Sometimes it you play the fool
But right now I'm doing me and it's fine
Nigga its cool

[Chorus:]
I hear em talking
All saying they doing they thing but they not like me
I'm getting all this loving all this money
That's how it is and how its gone be
When you balling, when you ballin
Watch the niggas on the sideline hatin
But I'm too high to hear what they saying, sayin

Definition of cold
Ice 30 below
Champaign foreign names in my pool
Take you home let you sleep in my clothes
Roll some weed the homies aint gotta know
Get you high
Keep it on the low
All this paper I fold
Meetin n'fucking hoes on the road
Is taking its toll
Now how you think don't even speak unless you talking Franklins
Ran outta weed but bought a joint to bake
(Nigga its cool)
So cool my bitch got no shoes
My whip is new but I'm playing old school
Always keep it up to date, that's why the hoes choose
Yesterday's paper, that's why you old news
Haterin on my team until they see we wont loose
I used to be a player
Now I coach fools
On how to get they money, live it and just spend it just like you posed to
Call some bitches to roll through and it cool

What is hittin' for
My niggas is winning though
Everywhere i'm at I make you feel like it is 10 below
It aint nothing yo
Let me change the temperature
and do i need to mention when

a-a-and then

What is hittin' for
My niggas is winning though
Everywhere i'm at
I make you feel like it is 10 below
It aint nothing yo
Let me change the temperature
and do i need to mention when

a-a-and then

I hear them talking and they all saying they doing they thing
but they not like me
I'm getting all this lovin'
all this money
that's how it is and how it's gon be

a-a-and then

when you're ballin
when you're ballin
you can see 'em major fans watch em niggas on the sideline hatin' (sideline hatin')
but i'm too high up i cant hear what they sayin'

a-a-and then

Back in my zone
Fresh out the B.E.T izzy
Shoutout Bieber and Nicki
Tell Mr. Hill we aint trippin
We cool
I'm blowing sticky
I'm blowing out of that lex
I'm living with no regrets
While I'm getting over my ex
Access Granted take a step up in my world, cuz
My niggas is thorough cut
Sipping hella Earl cuz
Oca, hol' up
I got bitches sewed up
What yall niggas know about it?
My kick game is world cup
World cup I know that they don't get me
I keep them bitches clean
Though my sneaker game is messy
Due to my underselling
No I did not get that Bentley
But this AMG wont do for nothing
And you niggas wont catch me
Vicious transmission for my vicious ambition
Said I just wanna rep my hood so I'm good if I don't get rich
I'm good if yall don't listen
Just catch me out the District
And I'm probably in some limited shit they aint never shipping
Sometimes you do get dough
Sometime you get the cheese
Sometimes you go stores and buy everything that you see
Sometimes you do get broke
Sometimes you be on E
But for now, just roll it up and just become one with the Breeze

[Chorus]</pre>
