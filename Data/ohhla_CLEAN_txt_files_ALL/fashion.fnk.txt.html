I'm a do a little song with Mr. Bu Bu
Girlies lose their minds, they go ooh ooh
We won't be too shy, like catch a coo-coo
We're going to stand like Desmond Tutu
I came in too tight in a voodoo
When we rock the mic you wish you could too
We blow the roof off to Timbuktu
Some bitches call us dogs, we go boo

I'm a do a little song with Mr. Bu Bu
Girlies lose their minds, they go ooh ooh
We won't be too shy, like catch a coo-coo
We're going to stand like Desmond Tutu
I came in too tight in a voodoo
When we rock the mic you wish you could too
We blow the roof off to Timbuktu
Some bitches call us dogs, we go boo

I'm a do a little song with Mr. Bu Bu
Girlies lose their minds, they go ooh ooh
We won't be too shy, like catch a coo-coo (ey)
We're going to stand like Desmond Tutu
I came in too tight in a voodoo
When we rock the mic you wish you could too
We blow the roof off to Timbuktu
Some bitches call us dogs, we go I
