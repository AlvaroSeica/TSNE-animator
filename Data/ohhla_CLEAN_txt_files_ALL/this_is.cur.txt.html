Song:   This Is the Life
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Still rolling in my Elco on them thiz-angs
Niggas fukking up. They ain't fukking with the pliz-anes
Hits from the bong, Cali strong, got me feeling like I..
Could kill a man, but I would rather kill a baseline
These coke laced lines, too dope for most they turn their noses up
Real niggas turn the music up more
Lookin out the cracked windows, sound and the smoke
Got you high off both. Drugs, audio
Yall ain't got the heart for it. Get ur cardio, in order bro
Running for the money, pockets double-stuffed... Oreos
Party over here. Bitches feeling like shit in the morning tho
It's the shit! Life with the Jets, with fair warning
Hoe call who you gotta call before we be off I live far
And ur phone mite not have bars
Babydoll break that weed up for me
I break you off something, have you running ur mouth, leading ur friends to me

[Chorus]
Ahhh
This is the life
Break down, then roll up
This is the life
Ahhh (lames catch feelings)
This is the life
Poolside, on rooftops (Jets count millions)
This is the life

Motor under glass like a pheasant
Jet plans under wraps like presents
Stayed in my lane, gained leverage
Executives checked my credit was merited
We hustling together better than
Going in blindly. Expectations not met
Fools get ejected. Dropped like a Pharcyde record
Gone into hiding like the canvas top of what I driving now
Riding up the block they think I'm moving in the autobot
Hop out, photo op. Scan for the cops. If they not about..
Light something for the cool niggas
Roll another one for the ride
Keep that bag that's all you nigga. I'm out
On another mission, steady paper twistin
Even when I was a broke nigga, bitches paid attention
On another mission, steady paper twistin
Even when I was a broke nigga, bitches paid attention

[Chorus x2]
Ahhh
This is the life
Break down, then roll up.(lames catch feelings)
This is the life
Ahhh
This is the life
Poolside, on rooftops (Jets count millions)
This is the life</pre>
