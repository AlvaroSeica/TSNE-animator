[Intro: Christian Rich and Utters]
"Good God Almighty. Like back in the old days.
 You know, years ago they had the A&amp;R men to tell you what to play,
 how to play it and you know whether it's disco and rock
 but we just went in the studio and we did it. We had champagne in the studio,
 of course, you know, compliments of the company, and we just laid back and did it.
 So we hope you enjoy listening to this album
 half as much as we enjoyed playing it for you. Because we had a ball.
 Only real music is gonna last, all the other bullshit is here today and gone tomorrow...."

[Verse One: Styles P]
All I ever knew was kingpins and gangstas
Life start to change when you sittin 'round bankers
Investors, back when the benz made the compressor
I compress my weed and never lost the texture
Went to get fifty, they threw me fifty extra
Highly appreciate the real strong gesture
School of hard knocks I never failed a semester
Fully loaded nine with the big winchester
Louch sold coke, Kiss sold coke
I sold coke we all sold dope
Right around the time I couldn't look at my old folks
On my block shit, pop shit, get ya nose broke (Get it broke)
Fuck around let a shot fly (Shot fly)
Ain't a minute a day that I'm not high
Real nigga I ain't switch up yet
We load heavy hope Chevy make the pick up 'vette
Whether blood or crip yeah I stick up sets
So I used too, now I'm gettin money off of juice too
I'm international not rational
You do what I say or do what I ask you to
Lookin at the work like I get shit off (Get it off)
Lookin at the hammer like I set shit off (Good lookin)
Take head shots so you can take that vest shit off
LOX nigga, know we keep the best shit dog

[Verse Two: Jadakiss]
Hip Hop depreciates the value of luxury (Uh!)
Personally, I won't allow you to fuck with me (Uh huh)
Fifteen a sack, bundles is one fifty (Yeah!)
You just had to be there the money would come quickly
Very obedient with the cake (Cake!)
'Cause I'm the ingredients with the cake (Cake)
One place you never see me is by the jahe (Jake)
Big cigars, martini's by the lake (Boss)
My connect still speak no ingles (Ha)
Says alot about you if you hatin me
Turn a little bit of dough into a bakery (Uh!)
Bunch of copycats, alot of fakery (Yeah!)
Becomin a monster, that's cause you makin me
I just wanna know who else is this strong
Generatin this amount of money for this long (L.O.X.)
Shots pass your crew
Yellow gold kilo, Yacht Master too (Uh!)
Get your Wallys dipped so the top moatch the blue 
Couple more shots I might blast ya boo 
Can't judge so they raped this shit
I stand behind mine got faith in it
I just sell it, I don't make this shit
I got work to do, I got cake to get

[Verse Three: Sheek Louch]
Cake, cake cake cake cake cake
It's hard to see the snakes snakes snakes snakes
They ain't thugs they jakes jakes jakes jakes
Find their bodies in the bottom of the great lakes
Ha! Do I think he the king?
Never that but hold up give that nigga a dap
Now these lame ass artist gotta think when they rap
It's almost back to the boom bap
It's no lyrical apps to download when I walk the ground fold
I'm heavy out the chevy I dump for reload (DONNIE!!!)
Ha! Was something out a magazine
Pretty bitch whip somethin out a magazine
Gun on me, clip? Nah that's a magazine (What)
I make money flip easy, no trampoline (NAH)
I done made a milli, P and Kiss made a milli
Hood could've if he wasn't actin silly
But no hard feelings
I ain't even in the hood now, no more chillin
Chasin money, jumpin off the tour bus posin for IG flicks
All around these chicks 
I ain't O.G. It's Rakim and Kane and them
I came right before Baby and Wayne and them
All these new niggas spit more pain than them
L.O.X. It'll never be the same as them</pre>
