Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
let me get this off my chest l-l-let's be honest I'm a be real girl
and even though I think about you
to be honest you ain't got nothing on my new girl
to busy worrying bout my exes not enough... worry bout your damn self
this is how I feel let's see how far you gonna get without Chantelle

[Verse 1]
chea sometimes I felt like giving up
that's when my loving kicked in started to strengthen up
thought we were made for each other
and the things I did with you id never share with another
hey was this too much to ask for
Itd be nice if you spent time with your man more
was it your jealous ways that caused us to go our seperate ways
I know I did some wrongs too I admit to my mistakes
and I was comfortable with you we never used a rubber
we'd put it deep in your gut and fill you up like supper
through a and uptown told you id be here with ya
gonna hurt to see another dude instead of me with ya
and I'm telling you the truth girl you still cross my mind even though I got a new girl
hey you always telling me to be real so don't be mad I'm just saying how I feel
bow wizzle hey uh

[Chorus]
now let me get this off my chest l-l-let's be honest I'm a be real girl
and even though I think about you
to be honest you ain't got nothing on my new girl
to busy worrying bout my exes not enough... worry bout your damn self
this is how I feel let's see how far you gonna get without Chantelle

[Verse 2]
hey you all around the world you saw things you would never see
heard me talking to o girl that's why you mad at me
you slept with a ton of dudes you know I know them too
but you could'ntkeep it real and tell me the fucking truth
but I saw it coming I knew it wouldn't last long
I wrote this all about ya girl this your theme song
I fell in love too fast thinking you was special
so you can keep dry girl I ain't gonna sweat you
I'm all on your timeline reading all those facts
we had about each other won't be the same between me and you
now you wanna work it out
what is there to talk about
talking about what you gonna do
girl you better shut your mouth
so goodluck with your next dude
I bet he don't treat you like bow do

hey you always telling me to be real so don't be mad I'm just saying how I feel
bow wizzle hey uh

[Chorus]
now let me get this off my chest l-l-let's be honest I'm a be real girl
and even though I think about you
to be honest you ain't got nothing on my new girl
to busy worrying bout my exes not enough... worry bout your damn self
this is how I feel let's see how far you gonna get without Chantelle</pre>
