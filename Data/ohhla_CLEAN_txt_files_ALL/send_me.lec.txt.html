[Intro/Chorus]
Send me, I'll go {*3X*}
Let me go {*2X*}
Send me, I'll go {*3X*}
Let me go {*4X*}

[Lecrae]
I seen it with my own two, there's no way I can show you
A perfectly poverty stricken people with no view
And I bet you can't believe this, they never heard of Jesus
Heard of Young Buck, Lil Wayne, and Young Jeezy
No one signing up to go on missions this summer
Rather sit at home and watch Xzibit pimpin a hummer
While a nine-year-old is shot down
No one screamin, "Stop now!"
No bridge illustrates for criminals who on Lockdown
People deep in Africa, lookin for an answer bra
In China men are dyin men until they know who died for sin
So - look what grace did, not for us to stay in
Inside our comfort zones at home in momma's basement
Get out on the grind y'all, ain't no better time dog
I know you read the Great Commission let me just remind y'all
Make Disciples of the Nation teach them to obey the Lord
Hate to never lead someone to Christ before I see the Lord

[Chorus]

[Lecrae]
Hey, after one thousand years in the West and the church is
gettin bigger daily without understandin worship
Some regenerated but alot ain't saved
You walk outside and be surprised cause the block ain't changed
And the numbers they be gettin them
Somethin still ain't hittin them
American's ain't Christian they just practicin the ritual
Thats why we should be missional hey what you think I'm spittin for
United States is dyin and the east is lookin pitiful
Some places if they catch you they'll arrest you and they'll serve you
But they still need the word too the gospel should be heard too
We claim we ain't ashamed but yet we still ain't hit the block up
We in our Christian bubble while our brothers gettin locked up
Lord I wanna stop up, take a bag and walk up
In a country where sharin my faith may get me shot up
Anyway ya go whether my city, Lord or Far abroad
I just wanna show 'em Jesus Christ the risen holy God

[Chorus]

[Lecrae]
I know they dyin in the streets, over in the Middle East
Some kids seekin peace, others holdin up a piece
If the violence doesn't cease then at least the deceased
might know Jesus as their savior as their body hit the streets
And I know this is a graphic view, I pray that its attackin you
'ttractin you, to act and do what you see in the back of Luke
Matthew 24 and 14 we should read it twice
Before we think that life is just about us bein free in Christ
Look dog, life is more than church, work, and football
What if you were dead in sin and Christians overlooked y'all
This is why we leave the couch and leave the comforts of our house
To show a dyin world a God they'd probably never read about
Yeah... the great commission says make disciples of all nations
Have we even made 'em in our own nation? Come on Christians
Missions exist because worship doesn't
People don't worship the God that made them
We ambassadors - let's go!
