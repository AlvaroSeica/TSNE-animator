[dialogue from the movie "The Network"]
You get up, and howl, about America and democracy
There is no America. There is no democracy.
We no longer live in a world of nations and ideologies!
The world is a college of corporations;
inexorably determined by the immutable by-laws of business.
The world... is a business.
And I have chosen, you, to preach this evangel.

[Immortal Technique]
For all my free market, health care-robbin
stock-stealin, retirement fund fuckin with niggaz
Fuck your little credit card-scammin, jewelry-stealin
crack-sellin, liquor store-robbin motherfuckers
Hahahahaha~! Shout to the homies, Carnegie, O.G. Willy Randolph Hearst
Farouk, Rockefeller - the real Rockefeller
My main bitch Leona, pour out a little Louis the 13th
Scott Rothstein, Jack Abramoff, hold your head
My Rothschild niggaz - LET'S GET THIS MONEY!

I spent my day pimpin American overseas
Pension for the workers? Nigga please
Embezzlement, etiquette, private settlement
I'm better with Confederate rhetoric
From my mansion in Connecticut
Foreclose, evict hoes at a tenement
I twist words like a speech impediment
I hope you got good credit bitch!!
If not, better get a new job with benefits
While I play golf with niggaz I get cheddar with
New money buys brand new karats
My old money bought your great-grandparents
You got grillz in your mouth, I ain't mad at ya
I own every gold mine in South Africa
Thanks baby, you made me a billion
Plus I own a building, for each one of my children's children
That's the shit~!
Snort coke in the whip, Miss USA suckin my dick
Yeah, what?! Fuck the law cause real jail is for sucker
I go to country club prison, you dumb motherfuckers
(I am the 1%, you fuckin bitch!)

[Chorus]
You know my CEO corporate steeze, please
Overthrow governments overseas in a breeze
Politicians in my pockets for a few hundred G's
So if I'm ever in court, my assets'll never freeze
(NEVER!)

[Immortal Technique]
I got a job and a house and a bank account when I'm out
I doubt that's somethin you can say
And if not better fake death like Kenneth Lay
Make money every day the world burns on its axis
while y'all struggling to pay taxes
I'm gettin my money the fastest
Memos and faxes, shredded up documents
Slush funds through the corrupt continents
But they don't want me indicted
Cause they don't want my dirty laundry aired when I fight it
Don't get my lawyers excited
Cause what good is a law if you can't rewrite it?
I got CIA traitors
Dictators, so fuck y'all whistleblowers and haters
(Heh, SHEEEIIIIITTT!)
All of this money from Al'Qaeda
In the bank 9/11 widows go to later
Capitalism's who I pray to
Fuck the state of the world
Money talks so what the fuck I need to say to a girl?
(I don't pay 'em to fuck! I pay 'em to leave!!)

[Chorus]
You know my CEO corporate steeze, greed
I treat countries like the IMF, down on your knees
Real gangsters run the world, fuck what you believe
I'll cut down a forest while y'all niggaz burnin some trees
I'll get yo' family murdered for a couple of G's
Cause yo' workin class money ain't fuckin with me
You think rappers are rich cause of songs you heard?
My labels make the money, and haven't rapped a fuckin word

[Immortal Technique]
Yacht in the ocean, coastin with the sails out
Hey America, thanks for the bailouts
I made off with the Banco Ambrosiano
Got away scot-free like Il Vaticano
Activists act a bitch, get mad at me
cause of my tax-free charity
Eighty percent to the staff and company
and twenty percent to the homeless and hungry
The country gotta pay the Fed Reserve
Kick back to the banksters, haven't you learned?
You protest cops who patrols on the street
But I bought City Hall so I own the police
E-mail, Facebook, and the shit you tweet
All the phone companies, so I heard you speakin
My suggestion is, your correction
No elections, sex with no affection
No invention of benefit to world of man
will exist 'til I got the money in my hand
World Bank interest rate, damn rape on the spot
But I'm a gangster, you gon' take my money like it or not, nigga
(I got your country in my pocket, motherfucker!)

[Chorus]
You know my CEO masonic steeze, cheese
Only little people pay all these taxes and fees
Since you were born we control what you watch and you read
And pretty soon we're gonna own the fuckin air that you breathe
I take what I want, fucker! I don't have to say please
I convince you that it's good for you, take it and leave
You think Presidents are the face of a nation
I put 'em all where they are, end of the conversation!!
Hahahaha</pre>
