Deep down in the Dungeon
I dropped a Freestyle and Re-Upped it
While falling three miles in a Bottom-less Pit
Madness Mouth Eye see out of like I'm swallowed, Ahab
Cactus round my Circumference...has circum to..a Karmaloop...Karma Sutra
Fuck my Lifestyle and everything that I'm used ta
Sometimes I Shutdown to Reboot my Computer
And, its a good High (Hi), never knew ya
These guys will make YOU say Goodbye to the Future
And, Here WE Go. YOU Play?
I still Control YOU by Remote. Touche
Go head and Use me User
I'm just a Vessel of the True GOD
Living, in the Belly of manure
Sinnin', sippin' Henny with a new Blunt
Damnit
I said I'll never Fall Back
But I been Ahead of Time, plus Life ain't all that
If this ain't Hell, Who are YOU God?
Forbid I sale my Self to Confusion

CHORUS:
"See First WE are Born, then WE become Scorned
WE fall in Love with the Pain that WE consider the norm
They throw dirt on YOUR name and give YOU a Crown of Thorns
Should I stop or keep goin'? I guess I'm torn."

Up High in the Stratus
I see that sometimes it's the saddest that see the Sun shinin' the fastest
Had to let It go to see if It would come back
Ayo-yo please come back
Visions of the Throne where He once Sat
Sits. Nazareth Peace, Love
Happiness de-bug
I can kinda see why people need drugs
I can kinda see why evil needs US
I can find the reason demons creep up
Like some eagle wings just before the leap and WE jump
Never with a care in the world spinnin'
Devil with a Dare is the worst endin'
Gamblin' with ya Life
Like a cannon shootin' dice, instead of bullets
Being brandished in the mind
It's insanity defined ain't no other way to put it

CHORUS:
"See First WE are Born, then WE become Scorned
WE fall in Love with the Pain that WE consider the norm
They throw dirt on YOUR name and give YOU a Crown of Thorns
Should I stop or keep goin'? I guess I'm torn."

Smack dab in the middle, like Limbo. Correct and Wrong
Devil playing Tug of War for my Spiritual
Hammerheads on the shore trynna swim with boats
Watching camera lens, Death Row from the Insterscope
Snakes in the grass like Eve in the meeting, watch Adam bow
Deceiving a Leader, till WE Pledge Allegiance, to them showing they ass like Chairman Mao
And, WE know the Real Deal
WE Battle with OURselves while the Ill Kill
My Satellite to Hell show the spiel
End up in Holyfields cause YOUR Arms too short to Box or Hold the Will (Wheel)

I tell 'em Behold the Will (Wheel)
Some can't handle livin' so they reload to kill
Skeletons in the closet or buried below the buildin'
But WE see through YOU like a peephole was built in
Replacin' True Self with the ego YOU filled in
WE ALL struggle with it
So who am I to judge with a rebuttal sentence

CHORUS:
See First WE are Born, then WE become Scorned
WE fall in Love with the Pain that WE consider the norm
They throw dirt on YOUR name and give YOU a Crown of Thorns
Should I stop or keep goin'? I guess I'm torn</pre>
