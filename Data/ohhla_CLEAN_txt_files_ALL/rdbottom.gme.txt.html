[Intro: Rick Ross]
Niggaz talkin like hoes, they mad they not in my shoes

[Chorus: Rick Ross]
It's the red bottom boss, came to buy the bar
Every five weeks shit I'm bound to buy a car
Murder-cedes Benz or that bubble Double R
Headlights flickin, lookin like a falling star (uhh)

[The Game]
Uh~! I'm 'bout to tear this fuckin track out
Pretend that it's Keri Hilson and blow her fuckin back out
Twenty-second mixtape, half of 'em diss tapes
But fuck who I was dissin cause I never made a mis-take
Bleek got what he deserved, Jay I mighta been trippin
I was fallin, I was slippin; he was Jordan, I thought I was Pippen
He was winnin, I was losin; he threw a jab, I start bruisin
So I, threw in the towel just to separate all confusion
Ivy Blue is beautiful, me sayin that's unusual
That's just the father in me, don't think I'm tryin to be cool wit'chu
Thug Life, Rihanna knuckles, Gucci shirt, designer buckles
Louis Vuitton billboard, for niggaz that's just tryin to hustle
Posterboy for the drug dealers; I just want y'all to love me
But I ain't The Phantom, I ain't really tryin to bug niggaz
Y'all the Verizon man, I'm just gon' stand behind y'all
But every now and then, I gotta remind y'all

[Chorus]

[The Game]
It's that red bottom boss nigga
Burgundy Bentley truck, who give fuck what it cost nigga?
That V12 start up like Ross nigga (uhh)
That's why them hoes call me the boss nigga
Catch me in that Maybach, where the seats recline way back
Remember I had a +Rocky+ for ya; I ain't talkin +A$AP+
Know I got that K strap, chopper with a basehead
If you see +Tip Drill+ and +King of Diamonds+ tell I got like eight stacks
Ace of Spades by the crates beitch
Never lose like Alexander the Great, beitch
I only win like Baylor, I run the city like mayors
Don't make me go dig up them old Chuck Taylors
Back when me and Snoop was the only ones throwin up gang signs
(Ahhh) and niggaz wasn't Bloodin 'til I came and co-signed y'all
But y'all the Verizon man, I'm just gon' stand behind y'all
And sometimes I gotta remind y'all

[Chorus]

[The Game]
+Taylor Gang+ nigga, I ain't +Wiz+ though
but I got that +yellow brick road+ inside my earlobes
Playin ice hockey, feelin like +Gretzky+
Los Angeles King, and I'm who the whole city gon' cheer fo'
Niggaz throwin subliminals, act like I don't hear those
I could give you six hundred bars but y'all know that y'all fear those
And plus I'm too attached to my lifestyle
Fuck them Air 1's, I'm too attached to these spikes now
Louis Vuittons, hard as croutons
They comfortable like futons, they suede, Grey Poupon
They yellow like Luke on the Lakers, he was traded
But they should have moved that nigga Marion, Gloria goof on
Damn, was that too strong? These niggaz gettin pooped on
While I get my Duke on, and crossover like Duhon
You lukewarm, I'm too hot; you too cold, I'm 2Pac
You're too old for hip-hop; stop, recognize

[Chorus]
