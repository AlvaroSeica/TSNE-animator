[Micah]
It all began on 2-10, 1975
Keeping it live, only a strong mind survive
A controller of the rhyme since the age of 9
Now I'm two of a kind, soon the best of all time
I design each line with prime intuition
A crime to decline this rhyme expidition
K-O definitely the definition
Moving you out of position, out of comission

[Damien]
I was born 6-18-74
Bringing light to this mic like never before
Specializing in the rhyme and the beats that blend
Been friends with them pen since the age of ten
Many say when I write that I freak the line
Every rhyme that I recite gotta speak my mind
Who sell every time with the beats that hit?
K-O on the flow be the ultimate

	From the underground we're the world renown
	D and the Mic with the verbs and nouns
	ARE makes the beat come down
	K to the O universal sound

	You rock ice all night (We don't do that shit)
	Play the big Will type (We can't do that shit)
	Sound wack on the mic (Never do that shit)
	Can't do that shit, won't do that shit

[Damien]
K-O taking the flow to new dimentions
Lyrically inclined to find intervention
The next revolution in musical evolution
Lyrcially exact with graphical resolution
The finest of the underground's unlisted
Lyrically intercontinentally ballistic
Universal sound bridging gaps over distance
You tout to even attempt resistance

[Micah]
For instance, the saga has just begun
Keep MC's on the run so beware of the tongue
Where I'm from there's no one that's quite as nice
When we grab the mic MC's go on strike
Closed by psyche dynamite and such
My vocabulary got the Midas touch
The Dream Team step on the scene, the threat triple
K-O cripple your soul, keeping it simple

	From the underground we're world renown
	D and the Mic with the verbs and nouns
	ARE makes the beat come down
	K to the O universal sound

	You rock ice all night (Well you can do that shit)
	Beg the crowd to get hype (We don't do that shit)
	Sounding wack on the mic (Can't do that shit)
	Never do that shit, we don't do that shit

[Micah]
Let it be known, we run more clones than Jim Rhome
Suckers get overthrown like Battledome
Known to unknown your whole zone is blown
Prone to break bones when the microphone is on
God blessed me with the verbal abilities and the rhythm
Six million ways to die, chose lyracism
Reflect like a prism over compact discs
Won't miss any MC who combat this

[Damien]
It's like this, it won't stop until I'm gone
I play the stage with the mic and my game face on
The mic is my chosen weapon, I stay armed
K-O rock every show that we perform
Prepare for the calm before the brainstorm
The shift of my jaws is cause for an alarm
Consider every song a similar to disarm
You all go respond with the call and respond

	From the underground we're world renown
	D and the Mic with the verbs and nouns
	ARE brings the beat around
	K to the O universal sound

	You rock ice all night (We don't do that shit)
	Play the big Wil type (We never do that shit)
	Beg the crowd to get hype (We can't do that shit)
	Won't do that shit, don't do that shit

	Don't do that shit, don't do that shit
	Can't do that shit, won't do that shit, don't do that shit
