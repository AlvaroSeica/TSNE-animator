Verse 1 *(Black C)*

It's strictly this game that I'm stickin to
and stayin true
tryin not to do what those fakers do
while I'm payin dues
I'm makin moves in this rap game
see everybody want the fame, I want the fourtune
niggaz be scorchin hot
got a place that I moved in up north
got my face on the front page of the Source
and dispite the ways, you niggaz playa hate
that RBL is breakin wails in every state 
don't perpitrate though I heard you wanna make moves like me
but you don't have the right skills for this industry
so never mind, I can always, catch you on the grind
you can't fade this game, see cuz this game takes time
but see you still havin million dollar dreams and it seems your plots 
and schemes to earn that knot ain't workin
but keep hopin, while I keep flowin
for strictly this game, stayin true
y'all ain't knowin.

Chorus *(Iyesha Johnson)* x4

Strictly this game, I'm sticking to.(Strictly this game)

Verse 2 *(Black C)*

This rap game is what I'm talkin bout
I'm makin clout
and got G's in my bank accout
so what you thinkin bout?
probably a robbery or to murder me
that jelousy an envy is what's hurtin us G's
you wanna take my possessions on the strength
I be wreckin this mic
gettin sponsered by Nike
all this hype be surroundin me
and I heard that on the block that you was clowin me, sayin
you ain't my homie to be a cold day in hell before I make enough mail
to help my niggaz to excel
I have a feelin I won't.... fall
I'm grabbin a hold to my chesse and sayin "Fuck all of y'all"
cuz we got bigger balls
so why don't you catch us in that V.I.P. section
seated to perfection
sippin hurricane, tryin to flirt them thangs
doin, what us playas do 
an ah, smokin truth
for this game stayin true uh.

*(Chorus)*

Verse 3 *(Black C)*

We been 360 degrees 
niggaz please
I cruised the world a thousand times
gettin mine
at the shows, proper hoes, spittin flows wit the homies
niggaz can't come backstage it's members only
an a bitch can't get no backstage pass
unless it's backstage ass
and that's word to my nigga C-Note, and he know
the way we used to work this
mo money, mo money green he felt that was our purpose
an when you hurt we got a spot
you was trippin gettin hot
wanna shoot me wit yo glock
wanna hope my album flop
but never that, my shit is phat
my shit be hittin hard like Barry Bonds that fuckin bat
that's real.

*(Chorus)* until it fades out.
