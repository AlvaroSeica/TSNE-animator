Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro:]
We untouchable, uncrushable
[2x]

[Chorus:]
You can be my piece
Click, clack
Click, clack
Tell them all get back
Cause we shootin
Shootin them down
[2x]

[Verse 1:]
Baby you are my piece of mind
Other chicks want a piece of me
Get the piece sign
You get the piece of love
Reserved in my heart
For you and you only
They peep and persist, why?
Keep reachin
Need to seize and desist
That's why I keep you equipped
Yeah, for the skeemers
Thinkin they gone come between us

[Chorus:]
You can be my piece
Click, clack
Click, clack
Tell them all get back
Cause we shootin
Shootin them down
[2x]

[Verse 2:]
I, I, I, I got a firearm fetish
Fascination
Infatuation
Yeah, for my haters
Raise a temp. give them fever
How I wish I could hold I could squeeze her
We make them reach for the sky
Laugh, make them cry
Believe till I die
So they can test our trust
But they'll never get the best of us
Bet, that

[Chorus:]
You can be my piece
Click, clack
Click, clack
Tell them all get back
Cause we shootin
Shootin them down
[2x]

[Bridge:]
I let them fly
I lay them down
Careful when you come around
This is my eye
This is my eye

Yeah I let them fly
Then lay them down
Careful when you come around
This is my eye
This is my eye
Music your mine!

[Chorus:]
You can be my piece
Click, clack
Click, clack
Tell them all get back
Cause we shootin
Shootin them down
[2x]</pre>
