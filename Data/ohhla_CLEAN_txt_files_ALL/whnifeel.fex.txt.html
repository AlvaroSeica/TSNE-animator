[Jeanne Jolly]
The evening sky seems half as high
And all the stars are twice as bright
Two hearts that beat in perfect time

As autumn days give in to nights
And summer's sun no longer shines
I need your body next to mine

You are the root, you are my guide
A place of truth that's free from lies
And only you I'll satisfy

[Chorus: Jeanne Jolly]
When I feel love...
Two hearts that beat in perfect time
When I feel love...
I need your body next to mine

[Phonte]
I never thought that I would find
My sunny day, my paradise
You are a dream that's realized

[Chorus: Phonte + Jeanne Jolly]
When I feel love...
Two hearts that beat in perfect time
When I feel love...
Two hearts that beat in perfect time

[Phonte + Jeanne Jolly]
(I need your body next to mine - two hearts that beat in perfect time)
(I need your body next to mine - I need your body next to mine)
I need your body next to mine, I need your body next to mine
Two hearts that beat in perfect time

[Outro: Jeanne Jolly]
Two hearts that beat in perfect time...
Two hearts that beat in perfect time...
I need your body next to mine...
I need your body next to mine...</pre>
