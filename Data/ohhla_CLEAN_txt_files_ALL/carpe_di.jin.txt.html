Typed by: AZ Lyrics

The Emcee yeah Carpe Diem
ya gotta seize the day
let's go

Ya see something you want then go for it (go for it)
don't think twice go for it (go for it)
don't think twice go for it (go for it)
don't leave this earth with nothing to show for it (nah)
I see something I want I go for it (go for it)
can't think twice I go for it (go for it)
can't think twice I go for it (go for it)
can't leave this earth with nothing to show for it

I'm part emcee part shaman
ressurect dead poets through the art of rhymin
a professor with extra hard assignments
inspired by the stars alignments
I cause defiance with bars of science
devour my prey like the jaws of lions
in laymans terms you lames can burn
my course only for those that came to learn
the proper mechanics how to use the linguistics
like the X-Men a school for the gifted
but before you can rock the crowd
I make you walk on hot coal no socks allowed
a simple test that'll set fire to the best
I represent the IQ's higher than the rest
heard the wind whisper sent the breeze my way
Carpe Diem yo I gotta seize the day trust me

Ya see something you want then go for it (go for it)
don't think twice go for it (go for it)
don't think twice go for it (go for it)
don't leave this earth with nothing to show for it (nah)
I see something I want I go for it (go for it)
can't think twice I go for it (go for it)
can't think twice I go for it (go for it)
can't leave this earth with nothing to show for it

if opportunity was at your front door and it saw it's locked
It might walk away so open before it knocks
I know I ain't the first to tell ya
when you don't take action you planting a seed for failure
you can bend the rules and break the guidelines
or follow the play and sit on the sidelines
which are you huh the first or the ladder
knowledge of self is a personal matter
well let's see double check the facts
if money grew on trees would you go and get an axe
prepare for the blossom achieve what's yours
or sit back and wait for the leaves to fall
see only in dreams will men be free
that's the way it's been and how it always will be
[pooofff]
I send the breeze your way
Carpe Diem yo you gotta seize the day trust me

Ya see something you want then go for it (go for it)
don't think twice go for it (go for it)
don't think twice go for it (go for it)
don't leave this earth with nothing to show for it (nah)
I see something I want I go for it (go for it)
can't think twice I go for it (go for it)
can't think twice I go for it (go for it)
can't leave this earth with nothing to show for it

I can show you the ropes I can even loan you the quotes
but if it ain't in you why even continue
to pose like your whole style is authentic
I smell a fraud the aroma is deep scented
I re-invented myself with the help of nobody else
yeah I did it solely for my health
not the rollie on the shelf or the 6 digits
the fame and fortune is highly ficticious
only exist to those with sick wishes
to achieve it they often act a bit vicious
and maliciously mislead the youth
I steer 'em on course cause my pen bleeds the truth
YOFAM the alternative to the street route
I use both hands whenever I reach out
that way you ain't gotta look hard to see em
and live by these two words (what) Carpe Diem

Ya see something you want then go for it (go for it)
don't think twice go for it (go for it)
don't think twice go for it (go for it)
don't leave this earth with nothing to show for it (nah)
I see something I want I go for it (go for it)
can't think twice I go for it (go for it)
can't think twice I go for it (go for it)
can't leave this earth with nothing to show for it</pre>
