[mc chris]
Name is mc and I'm here to say
I rock the mic with asbestos all up in your face
Old school like the one used by Ichabod Crane
Now watch me think up a phrase then put my spit on display
I ain't even begun to begin
I get up on the microphone and make fun of your friends
I'm like Black Thought cause I got your twenties and tens
I'm like your bittie won't go down on me in the back of your Benz
Snap off her bra while she kicks off her Keds
And put her butt on the bazooka tube and suck on her neck
And when I'm done yo your momma is next
Stackin' ho's like government checks, you gotta go like you Sever and Ecks
So whack mc's like +Butterfly Effect+ - yo they came and they went
All they money be spent like the rent
All me money's in the pockets of kids
That's why I rockin this shit Lickety-split

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
I read Variety
You're box office receipts
Are motherfuckin weak
You got nothin to say, you shouldn't fuckin speak

[mc chris]
I got my mind on my money and the rest in escrow
Missles on my wrist like my name was Destro
I'm whiter than your iPod headphones
Name is mc chris so let's go... (let's go~!)
I got more rhymes than than Ol' Dirty got cradles
I got more bitches than Madonna's got dreidels
And when it comes to kickin ass on cable I am more than able
But I kick it up a notch on karaoke turntables
Never mind the lyrics, know that you can hear it
Got the Mononoke spirit when you quote it back so fearless
Fuckin shit won't come near, it an mc fan endearment
+Save+ it like it's +Ferris+ in a trademark disappearance
You can't beat it like coat hangers once used by +Mommy Dearest+
But you run home and you blast it till you know you're hard of hearing
Wanna, be in the know gotta, crack the code
Ghettoblasted by bad kids across the globe cause I can flow
I got, beats galore got rhymes for days
I got nothin but a hundred hurricanes in my way
a/k/a people sayin quiet down and behave
Fuckin lame like the motherfuckin trucker hat craze

[Chorus]</pre>
