Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Wow, look at me, I have cookies and I have bitches
(What?)
You need some milk with those cookies cause you have five bitches
(What?)
I don't got to say 'No homo', cause you know, I got fifty bitches
(Fuck my bitch, please, fuck my bitch)

Five bitches, I got ten bitches
You stole my swag today, five bitches tomorrow
In the castle town, with the local people
Love and marriage, love and marriage
Got bitches, nobody gets mad
Ten bitches fuck me cause I'm cool
I got the swag, I got the juice, I got the pool bitch
Love and marriage, love and marriage
Love and marriage
I got the bitch, I got the ho, I got the pool
Buying pussy, buying bitches, buying tools
Buying mansions, buying ho, buying schools
Love and marriage, love and marriage
Fucking bitches, eating dinner cause I'm cool
I'm so cool, I fucked the bitch, she said I'm rude
I'm so rude, I bought the ho a plate of food
Love and marriage, love and marriage
Okay bitch, I'm living la vida loca too
La vida loca, and I'm still selling coca
Rob a bitch, rob a ho, or rob a dude, you feel me?
Love and marriage, love and marriage
Love and marriage, love and marriage
Love and marriage, love and marriage
Love and marriage</pre>
