[Chorus 2X: Buddy]
Staircases take me high
Escalators take me high
Ladders take me high
Elevators take me high

[Buddy]
Uh, yeah, yo, started at the surface and my goal is up
cause once you stay down, then you gon' get stuck
And I'm just tryna climb and grind at the same time
Dangling off rooftops is what I call hang time
Walking through the hall, counting my flaws
My ego got caught in an elevator wall
Got it out, raised it to the rooftop, damn
Got to take the ladder cause the escalator jammed
Made it to the top, but I ain't even stopping
I said a prayer and a wish, and turned my skateboard to a rocket
I'm gone to the skies, I'm nothing more than another rebel
But I'm still tryna take it to another level
Get up out the ghetto, maybe hop up on a shuttle
Eating jello with a piece of metal, my foot on the pedal
If people say the world could fit into a little pebble
Then give me one good reason why you think we should settle
Let's get it off

[Chorus 2X]

[Kendrick Lamar]
Look inside my eyes, you can see the universe fly
Deep inside my pupils, the alien's camouflaged
Another way to shoot you, my mind is of mass destruction
I drop a gallon of Henny in the Big Dipper, then dive
Bitches skinny dipping in my orbit
Ever seen a Martian gorgeous, or some UFO Porsches?
I live inside the air, plus I wear Air Jordans
So the mic/Mike is always near me whether swagging or recording
Journey on my voyage, you know that sky is the limit
But it's ironic, that method never applied to Kendrick
I catapult over your telescope, and when I'm finished
I grab the fire that's burning from Mars to light an incense
This rapping's just a metaphor, and I deserve a medal for
writing another metaphor, about ambition
I envision me taking off, astronauting myself
Fuck the world, I'll beat that bitch with the Orion's belt
That's high

[Chorus 2X]

[Buddy]
As I'm floating all alone, I look up and I start thinking
In a moment I'll be gone, getting high so I'm not sinking
As I'm floating all alone, I look up and I start thinking
In a moment I'll be gone, getting high so I'm not sinking
Yeah, yeah,yeah
Getting high so I'm not sinking, yeah

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
