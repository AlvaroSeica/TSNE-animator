[Chorus: repeat 4X]
He's a Bad Ass, Bad Ass Lil' Boy
Throwed Young Playa slangin Candy Red Toy

Throwed Young Playa slangin Candy Red Toy
He's A Bad Ass, Bad Ass Lil' Boy
Throwed Young Playa slangin Candy Red Toy
He's A Bad Ass, Bad Ass Lil' Boy
Throwed Young Playa slangin Candy Red Toy

[Lil' Flex]
ha ha aint nobody bad as me man
I'ma Bad Ass Lil' Boy ha ha

[Verse One: Lil' Flex]
Post it up on the corner wit mo'cheese then Ritz
Eatin scrambled eggs and grits watchin hoes do splits
Fly bitch wit tits try to fit in my mix
Shit you think I'm bad now you shoulda seen me at 6
At the age 11 I was breakin into houses
Stealin games,  pocket change, stickin dick in yo spouses
Sellin crack,  smokin sacks on a day ta day basis
About failed Junior High and got kicked out of Hastings
Serve places on the cool I'ma god damn fool
Inquiring minds why you treat me so cruel
Cause I'm bad to the bone I act young but I'm grown
18 wit my own home I'm the king on the throne
Me and Phee blowin tree in the back of the lobby
3 strikes, 2 assaults, and a 3rd degree robbery
You heard what they said I'ma Bad Ass boy
South West Houston, Texas you gotta feel that boy

[Chorus: repeat 4X]

[Verse Two: Lil' Flex]
I walk the halls like malls I role cigars like stars
When the bell ring for lunch I return to my car *beep beep*
Go my pager 911 must be major
Check my wallet for a condom that's my bitch maybe later
Should I go and smash her stuff or shoot some hoops at the GYM
(Go report to the principals office) that wasnt me that was him
All lunches I'm there shiny pieces that glare
Ny shoes be Nike Air (I gotta get me a pair)
Positioned boppers by lockers
Just cant keep comin wit dem choppers I rip my dockers
Lhey look gay huh but I'm young Betty Crocker
Who's bad?  Wit 2 pistols gotta mouth fulla crystal
Runnin from the security guards while they're blowin their whistle
Skipped a week of detention and got 3 days suspension
Referral read (Failure to comply Flex would not pay attention)
A lotta people say I'm good but I look very sneaky
Come here lil' girl you seem like da type that'd be freaky

[Chorus: repeat 4X]

[Verse Three: Cookie]
Oh girl look at him he's a bad ass boy
Watch him slang in the lane wit his candy red toy
I bet you've never seen a Throwed Young Playa like him
When we together we like Biggie and that girl Lil' Kim
For every bad ass boy there's a bad ass girl
Hop in and let me take you on a trip to my world
My name is Cookie I've never been a rookie
Remember back in school me and Flex shootin hookie

[Verse Four:Lil' James]
UGH OH, think fast here come Lil' James bad ass (ah shit)
smashin da gas, smokin grass, playin on da Dreamcast
playin music to confuse but dont choose to blow my fuse
unless you want some bad news cause I refuse to loose
When,  I make my own rules I'm grabbin my tools
Wreckin crews with no clues I'ma fool on the cool
They stay on the mash quick to tip right past
Leave a splash, break em off showin nuttin but ass

I'm a Bad Ass nigga thats why they call me Big Tetta
That's why I'm shakin up every puck cause my Benz is better
Man!  I'm slidin past as I go
Sippin on 40's, women tarin off my clothes
Man!  Lil'  Flex, why they wanna plex?
Standin on the corner and holdin two tits
Badass, Bad Ass Lil' Boy
Badass, Bad Ass Lil' Boy
Badass, Bad Ass Lil' Boy
Who's bad?</pre>
