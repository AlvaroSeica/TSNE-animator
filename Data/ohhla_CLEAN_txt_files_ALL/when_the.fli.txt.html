Verse one - Patience

You got a monkey on your back, not on some Michael Jackson
You saw yourself as rather bad since you were cytoplasm
You saw a bike when you were five and thought, I'd like to have it.
So you just snatched it, didn't you? That's your rite of passage
But that was wrong and you knew it so you felt like a bad-ass
Then the guilt just ate you up, already quite the catholic
It's twice as tragic, 'cause you're good and you don't like the havoc
But you can't help it and relish it, call it type sporatic
There's tragedy in your trajectory, you've dodged some bullets
They'd pull the wool and you'd push it and often call their bullshit
You gave history a hysterectomy and crawled into it
Had something but misdirected it with all the movement
And now, you're autopilot, blind and fossil-fueled or carbon-neutral
Vomit tossed and spewin' as you carve a blueprint
Onto two-inch tape with razor, you're a sovereign unit
I just roll my eyes and laugh because I always knew it

Chorus  Bender

When the satellites fall
Who'll be standin' up above when the whole world grinds to a halt?
When it breaks apart, when the satellites fall
Who'll be laughin' up above when this black hole swallows us all?

Verse two  Bender

You got a sharkbite on your abdomen, that's self-inflicted
All your idols live in hell, you're rubbin' elbows with 'em
You've got a hellenistic vision of the hell you live in
Is this real or television? You can't tell the difference
Wishin' on the middle finger of that monkey paw
You want some diamond rings to shimmer on that rusted claw
That's not a monarch that's inside you, that's a fucking moth
That moth is wearing death's head, he'll eat your stomach raw
You see some kind of revolution that you've masterminded
With plans to televise and sell off time for advertisements
You treat delusions like your children in the way they're nutured
If you had children, you would set them loose to rape and murder
Playin' chicken with the angel of your self-destruction
You felt this comin' since they snipped you off the bellybutton
I guess the joke's on you, it's looking like you've raised a phoenix
I guess the joke's on me too, there ain't no space between us

Repeat chorus

Verse three  Escrol

You got a needle in your genius like you're Charlie Parker
You think you need it but it treats you like a sparring partner
Who eat their children whole and call themself a starving artist?
It's hedonistic how you feeding off that heart of darkness
You treading gently but you front like you was waterboarded
They call it torture, but you longing to be drawn and quartered
They got you cornered so you warn 'em you in different classes
You lit a match but then you passed it off as splittin' atoms
A minute passed and now you waitin' on that final hour
It's been established that you're captain of this ivory tower
You sit in static while you wonder why you're uninspired
While you're pickin' shrapnel out your papercuts with rusted pliers
You got a chauvinistic vision of the solar system
Is this real or motion pictures, like you know the difference?
That broken english can't describe it when the sky is fallin'
All that you could hope for's to die with honour, so sayonara

Repeat chorus

Outro  Bender

Whatever you do, don't look up...</pre>
