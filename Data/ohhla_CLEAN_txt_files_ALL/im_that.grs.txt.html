[Chorus]
IM THAT NIGGA!!
B'itches cant stand in, niggas wanna jam in, and they wanna ban him
I'M THAT NIGGA!!
That come through clammin, nine in my hand an', and its not jammin
I'M THAT NIGGA!!
Hold on down the lot an', do it for them block an' and u cant stop him
I'M THAT NIGGA!!
No more talkin, the guns are sparkin, catch em in the coffin

[Meeno]
Your mama wanted you to be
Money, Clothes, O's nuttin new to me
Im that nigga that the bitches always talking about
Same bitch in the morning, pop dead in the mouth
Im the same cat that pop up in well hotel career-a
Birth from Australi-a, Mansion in ammer-a(?)
Meeno bust in my face and make my skit clearer
Meeno whats up with Mase? act like i cant hear ya
Stop asking questions call chinese sarah
One with all the tatoos like fucking rap dudes
Then call Nickie Dean, one who like a dick clean
Telling me to drop a hot 16
With the condoms, the hydro with spanish irene
At the double tree-sweats room 6-19
Its me, Grease, E-Snapps &amp; Full Figga
Rippin rock-house cause

[Chorus]
I'M THAT NIGGA!!
Bitches cant stand in, niggas wanna jam in, and they wanna ban him
I'M THAT NIGGA!!
That come through clammin, nine in my hand an', and its not jammin
I'M THAT NIGGA!!
Hold on down the lot an', do it for them block an' and u cant stop him
I'M THAT NIGGA!!
No more talkin, the guns are sparkin, catch em in the coffin

[Meeno]
Come through with the fuse on the block
New S-Class drop with the coochie top
That nigga with bricks on parole that due to dot
That nigga got a album that yo dudes due to cop
Nigga that the block love, the cops hate
Im the nigga that cop birds, get eights
Whos the last nigga u heard spit this great
No other than myself and uhh late great notorious
With the thugs niggas get no love
Act up, First slapped up and wrapped up
Im a nigga that blacked up, caddilaced up
The black semi-automatic, the mac niggas up
Im living it up, bitches giving it up
Main reason why niggas not giving a fuck
Im the nigga of the niggas that sitting next to the nigga
What the fuck u figga?

[Chorus]

[Meeno]
The 4-day str8, the same gear
Fifth day, fifty k on ? wrist-wear
Sixth day, fuck it im marchin the globe
World was made in 7 days yo niggas movin too slow
Thats why im speed-ballin, haters say its callin
They pray &amp; pray for my downfalling
I'm that nigga, grease stopped to be
I'm just trying to see if that nigga grease still to be
I'M THAT NIGGA!!!</pre>
