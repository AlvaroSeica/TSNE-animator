[Verse 1]
Who'd have ever known it'd come to this trying to
predict your future sitch is simple as peace is a flick of a switch
hitter. No prizes for not guessing that there'll be some days
where I get most of my protein from this paper that I write on
This same little Timmy was a sporty kid, and yeah the sun
worked its fryer on my pail skin funny thing frailty
I kept attending practice when my dad was having episodes
That left behind a family in tatters
And the subsequent descent under the poverty line
Still we had a roof above our heads and friends to grow and build with
And who'd have known of who I'd be if I had different early cards
But whose to ask what might've been I exercise my right to turn a
Blind eye to the rear vision, at which point the third eye'll hopefully
kick in and then make a mark or something maybe
we can all look forward to some added time to sleep in
and do some home improvements on the weekend out in Eden
Or, if it's okay, don't ask me any questions
Just let the pen make a natural progression
If it's okay don't ask me any questions
Just let the pen make a natural progression

[Verse 2]
I'd have never even tried to guess from three to thirteen
To eighteen what's now got me on full court press yes
In retrospect the hints were there, timid as a billboard
A batsman, keeper, graffiti writing creature
Sort of wrote a bit, it's now embarrassing but there's love
For those nursery rhyme raps in primary school Nug
They were bugged out but as if we weren't I copped
A tonne of verbal abuse but I'd say thankyou sir
I never came to cause trouble, we even wrote a rap
As peace offerings to Mr Beaumont when he had a baby
That was at 11, at 15 you could've seen them early morning
petty crime schemes I've got a pin inside my foot to prove it
you'd be stupid to assume that there were no regrets
But it's not over yet, I wind my window down a bit
Shifting gears from fourth to fifth
Left the career back at the tollway
Generation cynic Y2K without the rollplay

[Chorus] {x3}
Stranger things have happened, and it's not shock horror
And if you were to buy the bio then I wouldn't bother
It's just the way it is, call it my live review
Yeah I remember all these things while I'm hyping you

[Verse 3]
I had a fella tell me once of all his ideologies
You know the kind of scholarly filled chemical philosophies
Significance of numbers and your stars and your bloodlines
Scars from the sunshine tragedies and punchlines
Premature deaths occur before the person's ready
Said the fella before gently falling down and passing out
Well there you go the emporer proudly put out all he had on show
And here's a million bucks for guessing what tomorrow holds
Bank vaults and catapaults a liberal dose of smelling salts
To snap you back to Urth and yeah I've got present tense on lock
Known to deviate a little I guess, solving the how'd I get here
riddle and yes, there's still a bit on my chest
Was it the year I was completely depressed I swore I'd
Never take for granted when the skin disease left. And still don't
Still evokes potently as turning points tend to do
And sometimes I reflect on this while I'm hyping you

[Chorus] {x3]
Stranger things have happened, and it's not shock horror
And if you were to buy the bio then I wouldn't bother
It's just the way it is, call it my live review
Yeah I remember all these things while I'm hyping you</pre>
