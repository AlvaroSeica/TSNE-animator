Shit
Man, this shit is crazy
All I'm tryin' to do is live
I try to help out where I can, I always try to give
But everytime I step out the house it's like a war zone
People runnin' and screamin' and bustin' on my dome
Throwin' bricks, talkin' shit, and hockin' spit
All because of how I look and how I walk and live
One kid even walked up and straight up just slapped me (what the fuck?)
I cut his throat and returned to bein' happy
Cause I'm still alive

[Chorus - 2X]
I'm still alive, walkin' in the sunshine
And if I die, I'm dyin' with a smile on my face
And everybody out there better realize
That you can kill me, but I'm dyin' with a smile on my face (cause I am still alive!)

[Bonez Dubb]
It's fucked up, I got this place right on Knox and 38th
I got a nice view of the street, but it ain't safe (nobody's fuckin' safe!)
You see, you pass me by all day
On the way to work (to work)
You find me with a sign, I need a dollar cause I'm hurt (hurt!)
And I lost my job, man
And my pocket's on low
I keep on movin' so I get my box and go, but
This life is fuckin' tight
I'm fuckin' breathin', right?
And if I'm dead I'm dyin' high
Cause I'm still alive!

[Chorus - 2X]
I'm still alive, walkin' in the sunshine
And if I die, I'm dyin' with a smile on my face
And everybody out there better realize
That you can kill me, but I'm dyin' with a smile on my face (cause I am still alive!)

[Otis]
It ain't shit, man
See, what y'all don't realize is shit really ain't that bad
ya know what I'm sayin'?
Lemme tell you a little story of somethin' that happened to me
It went a little bit like this, it's like, uh

I got shot in my face like twice
The shitty part about it is who did it
Yeah, it was my wife
I didn't slap her or attack her
I just stood there and laughed
And grabbed my face up off the ground and started puttin' it back
She's a lifeless bitch, with no high hopes of Faith
Talkin' so much shit she needs a diaper duct taped to her face
I guess the moral of the story is don't worry about the hatred and lies
You got a family here and yes, we're still alive

Fade in: I'm still alive {4X}

[Chorus - 2X]
I'm still alive, walkin' in the sunshine
And if I die, I'm dyin' with a smile on my face
And everybody out there better realize
That you can kill me, but I'm dyin' with a smile on my face (cause I am still alive!)</pre>
