Typed by: Cno Evil

[Chorus: Kenny Wray]
In my hood, them boys ain't playing witcha
In my hood, them boys don't mess around
In my hood, watch how you talking
Or we gonna have to lay it down
In my hood, them boys ain't skating off
In my hood, them boys is on the block
In my hood, them boys get it popping
Now give us everything you got

[Napoleon]
Welcome to Virginia, the home of Bubba Chuck and Mike Vick
Gangstas don't work 9 to 5's, they rather slice bricks
A place where you can't trust a man, because he might snitch
A drug dealer's worst nightmare, is them indictments
Sheist clicks, standing proud, looking for nice licks
Fiends steal steaks from the store, to keep they pipes lit
Some dudes hustle for, rent-a-cars and nice kicks
Some got they dentals like stars, up in the white six
Some dudes locked in the feds, so now they wife tricked
No longer drinking St. Ide's, cuz now we light Crys'
Cops got to come through my hood with more than night sticks
Session eight, used to no dreams, then pull a heist quick
Come through and whips the same color as Christ piss
Everytime we get some good work, homey, the price switch
I do this, for soldiers with life, sleeping with ice picks
If you rep VA to the death, help me recite this

[Chorus]

[Napoleon]
I'm from a place where the gangstas get grimey, it's in the summertime
Kids ain't even teenagers yet, still they run with nines
Drug dealers out on the block, before the sun can shine
Late nite, they baking the cakes, but not the Duncan-Hines
Bodies get found in the trunk, mostly, tunks with shine
Judges giving football numbers, just for pumping dimes
Crack fiends lose weight, like Professor Klumpentine
Work so good it break glass like Dr. Dunkenstein
Keep thinking we country, you end up in a pumpkin vine
Done in VA where I'm from, they get crunk with lies
Sniffing like, Tony Montana, it's dumb, become a crime
You smoke, Reggie Miller, they rather build they lungs with live
Sip bottles of champagne, while bums get drunk with wine
My man D the hood rich, ghetto Donald Trump refine
If anybody, say we ain't stunting, you got punked, we grind
All day in projects, with 20 Captain Crunch to sign

[Chorus]

[Napoleon]
I'm from a place where you get kidnapped and held for ransom
They ain't see a star like this, since Ralph Samson
I'm handsome, summer nights, catch me in a Phantom
Driving through a ghetto that's foul, and get a ham one
Damn, son, I never leave home without my hand-gun
For a hundred grand, understand, they get your man done
And be crowned, the king of VA, yeah that's the plan, son
Ever since I seen Pharrell mansion, I demand one
Move like Roberta Duran, scram when the vans come
Hop 'cross gates like Jackie Chan, just to stay free
The seven cities motto, is fuck you, pay me
Out of towners, love it down here, just ask Jay-Z
When it first come, we stay busy like Christ on Day 3
Iced out, my swagger too cool, they use the AC
The industry done seen Chris Brown, but they ain't face me
The Kingpin wit the Inkpen, I'm something great, G

[Chorus] </pre>
