[Chorus]
Bitch I'm doing me, you should be yourself
I gotta get this money man, there's nothing else
Never snitch up on your niggaz
That's bad for your health
Never snitch up on your niggaz
That's bad for your health
Bitch I'm doing me, you should be yourself
I gotta get this money man, there's nothing else
Never snitch up on your niggaz
That's bad for your health
Never snitch up on your niggaz
That's bad for your health
Bitch I'm doing me, you should be yourself
I gotta get this money man, there's nothing else
Never snitch up on your niggaz
That's bad for your health
Never snitch up on your niggaz
That's bad for your health

[Verse 1]
I never snitch up on my niggaz
I don't do that there
Never bitch up on my niggaz
I don't do that there
Catch me everywhere that money at and I bet I'm there
And bitch I'm doing me
I just be myself
We don't fuck with new niggaz, so don't bring them here
Only the family where I'm at, and bitch that's OTF
And I blow loud for health
I can't help myself
I'm going in for the killing
I don't need no help
I love money, fuck a bitch I won't stress myself
And bitch I keep my mouth closed cus' I can't trust myself
I'm fucking other niggaz wives
I guess I need some help
I'm going in for the killing
I don't need no help

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I gotta get this money, man there's nothing else
Gucci for my waist, that's a designer belt
And I've never been a pussy, we could take it there
My hood would never let me, we could take it there
And we keep them tools around so please don't get mad
Ok, hold my [?], I guess I'll take one step
Ok they playing like they real, but they ain't really real
They about the streets but bitch I'm in the field
My youngest rob and kill, so tell me what's real
I don't fuck with fuck niggaz cus' they quick to tell
My youngest rob and kill, so tell me what's the deal
Ok my youngest rob and kill, so tell me what's the deal

[Chorus]</pre>
