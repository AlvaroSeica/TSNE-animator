Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1: King Lil G]
People say they love
The way I do my hustle
They love the way I treat my people
How I'm stayin' humble
This is to my fans
I never told you this
I never got a chance to tell you
But I owe you this
I hope I get a chance to meet you
We could smoke to this
And we could talk about life
And where to go from this
You going through some drama
We got things in common
My success is the reflection
Of negative comments
And negative people
Who say I don't deserve it
I guess I gotta break it down
On how the fuck I earned it
I never paid to get on songs
With a famous person
Recorded songs in my garage
Even on my birthday
Late nights
I had no help
No record label
I told you I it did by myself
Recognition
On a independent scale
I wish freedom
To my homies in jail

[Chorus: Carolyn Rodriguez]
Smoke the finest of trees
I'm flyin' so free
And feeling the breeze
And finally I'm..
Living my dream
This is what I prayed for
Living my dream
I'm so grateful

[Verse 2: ISuppose]
Yo, I was 19 strugglin
Thinkin' bout givin' up
Thinkin' life as a shorty
Shouldn't be so rough
Mama said get a job
Daddy said he needed funds for the rent
Move forward
Haven't looked back since
I remember back then
Everybody said I was dope
Then time pass &amp; I was broke
And everybody lost hope
Now its back to the block
Dealin' coke
Chillin' with the hustlas
Lost faith in my dreams
I knew that I was fucking up
Pockets had a hundred bucks
My heart had a lot of pain
Told the world my story
And it hasn't been the same
Now I'm travelin' the world
Breakin' bread with my team
Woke up from a nightmare
Now I'm livin' my dream
So here's a middle finger
For the ones who said I couldn't do it
And a toast for my fans worldwide
That bump my music
Without you I'm useless
Always know what's you're worth
I don't sign record deals
Cause I rather sign a shirt

[Chorus: Carolyn Rodriguez]

[Verse 3: Self Provoked]
Yo, myspace, myspace
When my face was first seen
And heard music player
Playing my verse
I learned many things in the game
And dick riding wasn't one
Seen the fan base grow
My haters learned to love
But not all
I write on the flaws that I have done
Commit to staying true
Never glorify the gun
If sidetracked
My fans remind me to drop something
Reminiscent bout the shows
And the other fun things
A crowd full of people could make
A different city feel like home
Especially, when I hear them chant
On a high note
Can't be an idol but an example
Of all the obstacles
We got yet to trample
I'm planting all my seeds
Along this game never wrote
The outcome is all these ears
That allow me to grow
And as the number keep growing
I swear to you
That I won't ever fall victim
Of losing sight of my conscious mind

[Chorus: Carolyn Rodriguez]</pre>
