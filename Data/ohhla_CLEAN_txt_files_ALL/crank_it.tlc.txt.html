[Intro: Lisa Lopes]
All My Ladies, in the house, at work, at play, wherever your at be
No, I dont know if you heard meawwwww

[Chorus: Reigndrop Lopes &amp; Lisa Lopes]
We in this party wilin we came to crank it up
Crank it, Crank it, Crank it
Crank it, Crank it, Crank it
Ladies in the club put your drinks up
Let me see your hands in the air shake your derrière
Crank it, Crank it, Crank it
Crank it, Crank it, Crank it

[Verse 1: Lisa Lopes]
All my ladies, go crazy
Tell your man tonight, keep the baby
Its his turn, he got to stress
Go to the club in your tightest dress
No parking dont waste your time and
Park his car in front of a hydrant
When the cop writes a ticket and heres your chance
Dont blow it, go ahead dare him to tow
In the venue, do what men do
Anybody who asks, tell him your single
Get them numbers, get your drink on
Get your flirt on, put your ring on
Transform like digitally
Lose your bra and hosiery
Shout verbal larceny
Stomp your feet shaking that ass to the beat

[Chorus: Reigndrop Lopes &amp; Lisa Lopes]
Crank it, Crank it, Crank it
Crank it, Crank it, Crank it
Crank it, Crank it, Crank it
Crank it, Crank it, Crank it

We in this party wilin we came to crank it up
Crank it, Crank it, Crank it
Crank it, Crank it, Crank it
Ladies in the club put your drinks up
Let me see your hands in the air shake your derrière
Crank it, Crank it, Crank it
Crank it, Crank it, Crank it

Crank it, Crank it, Crank it
Crank it, Crank it, Crank it
Crank it, Crank it, Crank it
Crank it, Crank it, Crank it

[Verse 2: Reigndrop Lopes]
Reigndrop, aight on the count of ten
I want eerybody wilin out
One, two, three, four, get your booty on the dance floor
This is not the time to be shy
Let your hair down, grab a guy
Move your hips till they separate
From your torso, the lower you go
So low you touch the floor
Come back up and crank it some more
Five, six, seven, eight, doesnt matter if youre gay or straight
The music doesnt discriminate
Feel the beat and the tempo say-it
Nine ten, now do it again
But this time, I want you to wile out

[Chorus: Reigndrop Lopes &amp; Lisa Lopes]
Crank it, Crank it, Crank it
Crank it, Crank it, Crank it
Crank it, Crank it, Crank it
Crank it, Crank it, Crank it

We in this party wilin we came to crank it up
Crank it, Crank it, Crank it
Crank it, Crank it, Crank it
Ladies in the club put your drinks up
Let me see your hands in the air shake your derrière
Crank it, Crank it, Crank it
Crank it, Crank it, Crank it

Crank it, Crank it, Crank it
Crank it, Crank it, Crank it
Crank it, Crank it, Crank it
Crank it, Crank it, Crank it

All my ladies, All my ladies, All my ladies
Just let go

Crank it, Crank it, Crank it
Crank it, Crank it, Crank it
Crank it, Crank it, Crank it
Crank it, Crank it, Crank it

We in this party wilin we came to crank it up
Crank it, Crank it, Crank it
Crank it, Crank it, Crank it
Ladies in the club put your drinks up
Let me see your hands in the air shake your derrière
Crank it, Crank it, Crank it
Crank it, Crank it, Crank it

Crank it, Crank it, Crank it
Crank it, Crank it, Crank it
Crank it, Crank it, Crank it
Crank it, Crank it, Crank it</pre>
