Song:   Count on Me
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Unh huh, unh huh, Unh huh
Count on me
When you need that shoulder to lean on
I'm here
Count on me
When you're all alone
Woah, yeah
I'll be there
When you need somebody to talk to
I'm here
You can count on me
You know I'm always there
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm here

See I know it may sound crazy
But I swear it's all true
Every word of every love song reminds me of you
And I know, I know, I know, I know
You feel the same way to
'Cause you stick around and put up with the stupid things I do
But I'm sorry
You know that you can always always count on me
Do you feel me?
(Unh huh, unh huh, unh huh)
Because I love ya
Girl I can't see myself wit' nobody but ya
Aww nah
Always know that you can

Count on me
When you need that shoulder to lean on
I'm here
Count on me
When you're all alone
Woah, yeah
I'll be there
When you need somebody to talk to
I'm here
You can count on me
You know I'm always there
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm here

Switchin' lanes and hittin' corners in my 7 45
Tryna make my way to you
No where else I wanna drive
Feel so lucky
I'm so lucky that I found that special one
The first time I seen you smile
Was the day my life begun
'Cause I love ya
I love you so much I would scream it out in public
Can you hear me?
(Unh huh, unh huh, unh huh)
'Cause I need ya
Some people doubt our love
But I'll make'um believe us
Aww yeah
And always you can

Count on me
When you need that shoulder to lean on
I'm here
Count on me
When you're all alone
Woah, yeah
I'll be there
When you need somebody to talk to
I'm here
You can count on me
You know I'm always there
Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Sing it with me

Ohh, ooh, ooh, ooh

I'm here

Ohh, ooh, ooh, ohh

I'm here

Ohh, ooh, ooh, ooh

I'm here

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Count on me
When you need that shoulder to lean on
I'm here
Count on me
When you're all alone
Yeah
I'll be there
When you need somebody to talk to
I'm here
You can count on me
You know I'm always there
I'm here

I'm here
I'm here</pre>
