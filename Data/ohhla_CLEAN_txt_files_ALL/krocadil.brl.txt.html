(Grrr, Rrrr, You Go In, Worms go out, Err ??? 
Comes out Comes out)

[Verse 1]
Chop 'em up, Chop 'em up, Chop 'em up, Chop 'em up
Cut 'em up, Cut 'em up, Cut 'em up, Cut 'em up
I don't be givin a muthafuck 
red dead body in the truck
tying nigga up in the truck [Grrr]
This is my last time
Sicker than a ass fires
It's been a bad nightus
It's f'na pass by us
I heard you was a cannibal?
I heard you take the [bleep] skulls and eat 'em up like a cantaloupe?
I heard you eat the human meat like humans eat the animal?
See I didn't talk about me I'm about these antidotes
Pain killers, Prozac, Muscle relaxers
Trust me my back hurts
Insane in the membrane, nigga
my brain might be on backwards
I'ma get back to work, 
kill 'em put 'em in the cardboard box
Brains in the basket!
Rumor has it I lock like a mastiff
And I got enough zip lock plastic
Giving nigga that hip-hop gasket
Who could put him in the ziplock fastest?
Me, that's who!
Shit get thick like a molasses

[Chorus pt1]
I'ma get 'em and put 'em up in something sinister
Finish the muthafucker maybe cause I'm about to finish 'em
When does this cannibal mannibal animal finish up?
I don't know

[Chorus pt2][2x]
I just hate the way things are
I fucking hate the music now
Rappers need to get smacked
Showing aint useful now
They one hitter quitters
Skinny jean niggas, R&amp;B singers
Im a Krocadil meat eater

[Verse 2]
Rip 'em up, Rip 'em up, Rip 'em up, Rip 'em up
Cut 'em up, Cut 'em up, Cut 'em up, Cut 'em up
I be giving the liver disease, killing 'em!
Turning the insides to rawhide, grilling 'em!
This is what happened
I wrapped him up in some plastic
And took him home for the acid battÂ… 
It's so funny I have to laugh [Hahaha]
These niggas ain't eating meat
I beat and delete
Taking 'em out for cheap, I'ma put that body up
Blood stain in the motel lobby
I'ma probably cut
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
I'm an all day nut, Friday, Saturday, Foolsday
I'ma put the 9 milli to your toupee
Clock 'em out on Friday it's a new day
Cut a mile spread the body over Tuesday
Two Labels, nigga two chains
Put your knife in the black backpack
In the black Cadillac make em take a catnap
I get raw like Eddie Murph, nigga
Have your family hurt, nigga
I put family first, nigga
Fuck around and make it worst, nigga
[Aight push him out the door]
Put 'em in the hurst, nigga

[Chorus pt1]
I'ma get 'em and put 'em up in something sinister
Finish the muthafucker maybe cause I'm about to finish 'em
When does this cannibal mannibal animal finish up?
I don't know

[Chorus pt2][2x]
I just hate the way things are
I fucking hate the music now
Rappers need to get smacked
Showing aint useful now
They one hitter quitters
Skinny jean niggas, R&amp;B singers
Im a Krocadil meat eater

Now Ima eat

Eat 'em, Eat 'em, Eat the guts up.[12x]
 
Eat 'em Eat 'em Eat 'em [x15]

[Chorus 3x]
I just hate the way things are
I fucking hate the music now
Rappers need to get smacked
Showing aint useful now
They one hitter quitters
Skinny jean niggas, R&amp;B singers
I'm a Krocadil meat eater

I... need to call... Chris... RIGHT NOW!
