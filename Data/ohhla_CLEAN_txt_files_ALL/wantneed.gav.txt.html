[1st Verse]
Let me start with a brief introduction
The name's gaVen, gaV for short
Never met you before
Mi amor, don't compare me to them
Or compare me to men that broke your heart
That you bury within
Got a shovel, and I'm ready to dig
If you ready to take, I'm ready to give
And I'm ready to live
More candid, yet cautious
I ain't gaming, so don't forfeit
I'm all in, dedicated to you
If you used to the lies, dedicate you the truth
I'll cater to you, while you cater to me
Plus I heard you got a vacancy
So I'm patiently just waiting to trade contacts
No need to worry, I'll hit you whenever I'm back
To a spot that we could chill and just vibe
Open your mind
Put your fears to the side
And let the temperature rise

[Chorus]
I'm reaching out my hand, hope you reach back
You're the one I wanted and I need that
You're the one I dream for, I'm the one you scream for
And I know I make you react
You gotta let your guard down
Searching for your heart now
It ain't nothing that could tear us apart now
We together
And that's forever
I know what you want
I know what you need
I know what you want
I know what you need
I know what you want
I know what you need

[2nd Verse]
I ain't really have a type but you changed that
And I ain't ashamed to honestly say that
I'm maturing for the better
I warned you
Now we together and forever I adorn you
Yup, it's for you but it's for us at the same time
We share evenly âcuz life ain't what it seems to be
We gotta lose all the distractions
And the friends that didn't want us to happen
It sounds like I'm rapping but I'm not though
And if it wasn't for trust it wouldn't be possible
I spotted a rose from the concrete
The places we could go are only in mind's reach
You dream as I speak
Let me peek into your mind for a minute
If you seek then you should find that we getting
To a spot that we could chill and just vibe
You gotta open your mind
And put your fears to the side
And let the temperature rise

[Chorus]
I'm reaching out my hand, hope you reach back
You're the one I wanted and I need that
You're the one I dream for, I'm the one you scream for
And I know I make you react
You gotta let your guard down
Searching for your heart now
It ain't nothing that could tear us apart now
We together
And that's forever
I know what you want
I know what you need
I know what you want
I know what you need
I know what you want
I know what you need</pre>
