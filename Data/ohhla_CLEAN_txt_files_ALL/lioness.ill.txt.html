[Lioness]
Ill, but not an omen
Although posessin the essentials necessary to indulge in
the activity involvin, beats that ignire and
words to aim the sparkin
The light in his eyes, I can see it, illuminates the path
to the soul now I'm walkin, forward to the gates
Fully decorated, open and unfold a
vision well awaited I don't treat with all the gold
Silver and the gems, end up on my pens
Rich from within, treasures do we send
Abbreviatin the property accumulated from this friend
I accept the ownership of inspiration that extends
Front back and side to side, would he bend?
Yes I replied, and swear on my talent
It is tragic to deny, the power in his person
Generated through his verses, makin me oblige
Just to experience, a deliverance
with respect to his gift, handed from birth
Born without an option
Instinct is his drive toward rockin in summation of his worth
And thought behind the mass of his works
while he brings about a boil inside the earth
