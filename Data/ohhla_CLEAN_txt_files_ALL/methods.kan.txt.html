Typed by: mikeykash@hotmail.com

(Chorus)
We all infested maggot brain infected
Accepted no other ways just methods
To live life hours to minutes upon seconds
Upon crime upon jail upon time

(Verse 1)
It used to be all gravy now its all grave
Baby G's on the block dont know how to behave
They just a slave to the guns and hums from shoulder straps
Migratin' in the parlors all across the map
The phones tapped with the source sayin so da feds way
With strong evidence but still the cops take
The crime scenes littered with drugs and submachines
Thugs with open spleens got shot up for cream
The American Dream is full blown
My half grown niggas in they 1 point 5 aya (area) homes
The end o' the loan
No its no need for a loan
The streets and the bank colateral has smoked weed to crank
Who do ya' thank?
The government corners and fiends but tippin' the beams
Niggas gettin' paper and rings
Money machines is jammed cuz' the count is extreme
My D.E.A. moves in swift with S.W.A.T. teams
Will rush into the sound of flushing
Guns busting, fingerprint dusting, handcuffing
But will be out soon

(Chorus)
We all infested maggot brain infected
Aceepted no other ways just methods
To live life hours to minutes up on seconds
Upon crime upon jail upon time
Cuz young minds with black 9's
On bus lines
Rob you for yours
Rob me for mines

(Verse 2)
He's looking out his window checkin' the streets
For my villa town cars and F.B.I sweeps
Involved and caught up in a world so deep
That he barracades doors just to sleep
And even if he does
He still has dreams of what was
Occupatious smugglin' dope through weigh stations
With coke in the bumpers
Reefer in the dash
H-K 45 semi-cocked up in the stash
Like a stupid motherfucker smokin' some hash
He reached for the lighter than crashed
The State Trooper passed
And asked if he needed some help
And saw another gun in his belt
Now I dont have to say what went down
With 'caine on the ground
It was on the handcuffs clicked and he was gone
A pawn in the game
Give us a name
Or 9 years
And dude started blastin' they ears
With top reps and cartel routes to in-and-out
Sutta piers of who does what and where it is
But fool Schooly stuck in the dirt like a dually
Or pull out forgettin' what it's all about
And post bail and try to haul tail to the next town
And try to go underground till they come around
Askin' questions and lookin' for his whereabouts
Torturin' niggas until the truth comes out
Movin' in silence and provin' that violence speaks loud
Pullin' niggas out the crowd
To break limbs
So when they ask them once again
Then tell a nigga every place you been
The shit is getting thin
In the thickness
So with the quickness
Grabbed his car keys and guns, bullets and g's and uh
Hit the door saw the mind puttin gloves on the hands (Physical Game!)

(Chorus)
We all infested maggot brain infected
Accepted no other ways just methods
To live life hours to minutes upon seconds
Upon crime upon jail upon time
Cuz young minds with black 9's
On bus lines
Rob you for yours
Rob me for mines
Rob you for yours
Rob me for mines
Rob you for yours
Rob me for mines

(Verse 3)
This next one is none from young and the old
Body tempa-ture cold a bomb ready to explode
A short stem fuse from ghetto child overload
Too many problems on the block fuckin' area code
Since pre-school he kept big tools for big fools
And alley ways jackin niggas breakin' the rules
But soon joined
And coined the phrase
Peeling caps
Before these new school gangster boogie
Bustin' with gats
At age 12 head o' the gang doing his thang
Checkin' cats by the liquor store nigga you bang
If you wasn't you was li'ble to catch a ass whoopin'
If you was then would be ya' last time livin'
He's crippin till the casket drops
Trippin' on the cops
Knockin' out ya pops
Smashing niggas at the bus stops
And snatching weed up out the bud spot
Makin' a hood hot
Will it ever seize? Of course not

(Chorus)
We all infested maggot brain infected
Accepted no other ways just methods
To live life hours to minutes upon seconds
Upon crime upon jail upon time
Cuz young minds with black 9's
On bus lines
Rob you for yours
Rob me for mines
Rob you for yours
Rob me for mines
Rob you for yours
Rob me for mines

We all infested maggot brain infected
Accepted no other ways JUST METHODS!!</pre>
