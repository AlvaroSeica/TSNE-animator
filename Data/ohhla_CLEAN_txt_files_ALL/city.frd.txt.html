Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
I'm 2Pac in two spots the block is secured
Stacked up to a fiend me, I'm the one you should call
But shawty on tour, Juicy Couture over law
In the drough when it's fire bet I can talk em to fall
Rhymes spreaded, I said it with a style
Commercial dealer, I gave em coke and a smile
From poverty, no cold, it was foul
Now they admire me, I've been broke in a while
Wild, can't be talking to me
After my show, I have to be forced in the V
King of New York, Christopher Walken to me
Figgy and pumble, Christopher's walking to me
Slick talking tatty, bare arms, from iIran, hope you ready
Grave yam yankee fitty cap, Fred The God and I came to bring the city back

[Chorus]
You know I bees in the city
You drive V's through the city
You push keys through the city
Mayor Miles gon give me the keys to the city
Now rep your city, this is for the streets
Now rep your city, this is for the streets
Now rep your city, this is for the streets
Now turn up

[Verse 2]
New York life is lawless
I got the city turnt up like the stocks dumped on Mike and Harris
Works the purest, same color is all the choke
Girl here from school, she studyin the art of chow
Forget the vest I wear liff up
TBM the best, they will clip em
Heard you got sour around, well we'll stick em
For that 7 pounds with the Wesson I will Smith em
7 pounds Will Smith, big Bronx uptown and we still spit
We back flowin and y'all know I got lines around the block
Like the tunnel back open
Speaking of tunnel, you know the sun is span
Call me Harriet Tubman cause I got tunnel vision
Blue Yankee fitty cap, Fred The God and I came to bring the city back

[Chorus]
You know I bees in the city
You drive V's through the city
You push keys through the city
Mayor Miles gon give me the keys to the city
Now rep your city, this is for the streets
Now rep your city, this is for the streets
Now rep your city, this is for the streets
Now turn up</pre>
