Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro]
Pray
Praises
Give thanks
To the Fada
Holy Water
Jesus piece
But don't nobody wanna know Jesus' peace, no

[Verse 1]
Niggaz use me to shine
I been helpin you stunt
Look why these rapping dudes ain't hit me in months
I don't ask for too much
Covered in VVS's
Women gon play ya closer
And them hungry jokers gon try test ya
Now they bumping your record
Ya confidence through the roof
Still ya show no respect kid
The good book said pray
But you so stuck in your ways
You got my image appraised
Why you sinning out waiting
Fornicating with women I sat right there on your table
Don't bow your head for grace
Though I'm keeping you graceful
Brothers was born to cheat
Though I question who faithful
Fast for me nope
Blasphemy though
Rap to it so racks up
To match up with me froze
How can a diamond supersede my wisdom
I seen a reverend with five of me as he read his scripture
This is bible readings to people with malice intentions
You silly get wits seen ahki with crucifix pendent
With a Cuban attached
On a secular scene
I died for you all
Now niggaz die over me

[Chorus]
Jesus piece Jesus piece Jesus piece
But don't nobody want know Jesus peace
Jesus piece Jesus piece Jesus piece
But don't nobody want know Jesus peace

[Verse 2]
Sierra Leone diamonds
LA to New York got em'?
If nobody stores have me
Some probably would know about me
All over paparazzi
Shout out to Murakami
See they commercialize me
I'm sure there will be more robberies
Work
New chain swag get you crew laid fast
Or laid down or not a ticket next to dad
And the bible told you wait on my arrival
But patience was your problem
So get Jacob to come find me
And religion is a style if not
Then why this shit a quarter mil
No fugazi see Jacob tell you that ish real
Hallelujah the things you do to be the manure
You never thank me at shows but you keep me on tour
Sunday services pastor is the wealthy ones working it
Preaching Armageddon while collection plates been circling the room
Fears but a tool
And Gospel gone commercial pray the purpose isn't cruel
And the workers in the pulpit want they blessings to improve
And they stone me on the cross and niggaz stone me for the ooh's
And the ahh's foolish
What am I who are ya
I'm coming down from the sky cause niggaz keep praying to shine
Look
Amen

[Outro]
For the price of fame
What would you do to have em' say your name
See I promise I would never cop another chain but the arms spent on these VS
Got me in that complex page
For the price of fame
When that Bugatti drop my accountant stop me for a second and said not today not today
For the price of fame

For the price of fame
What would you do to have em' say your name
It is such a shame</pre>
