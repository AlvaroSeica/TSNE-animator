yeah yeah, DTP, how we do, call you, you can call me
Whatever you want to do baby, come on

[Chorus]
J/Weav:
Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me
I'm only one call away
Chingy:
You could, roll with, me, if you was my baby
J/Weav:
Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me
I'm only one call away
Chingy:
You could, roll with, me, if you was my lady x2

It was weird how we met, hugh? She was with her mom at Bank of America
With my son cashin a check so I asked out of respect, uh
Would she like to explore the world of I we can fly in my jet
Her reply was yes (Can I ask you something?)
I seen it in her eye Moma looking like all I wanted was sex
Then moved to the next (That aint true)
But it was something about his girls style that make me feel no regrets
We started off casual walks threw the park
Candle light dinners by dark, I'm thinking smart
Afraid she might think I'm in a rush to touch, clutch and be up
But baby I aint on that stuff Dropped her off and told her call me up (ring noise)
We could talk, conversate about ??? whatevers starts
So I zoomed off (car noise)
Looking bottom off my phone rang
It was her in the shower (what did she say?)
She said I couldn't do without you Then I say

[Chorus]
J/Weav:
Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me
I'm only one call away
Chingy:
You could, roll with, me, if you was my baby
J/Weav:
Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me
I'm only one call away
Chingy:
You could, roll with, me, if you was my lady x2

Yo yo
The next day I'm with the fellas at the case playin ball
Here she come with her friends they posted up on the wall
Now I'm showin off, tryin to dunk, tryin to dribble
Break fast threw the middle just to see her smile and giggle
Game over I approached her with a kiss on the cheek
The homeboys looking at me saying Lil Howard you weak
But you know how that go, what I got they want
What I got I flaunt, never mess with it please don't
Told her I'm goin home she asked can she go too
I'm like yeah boo, I can't see me without you
Got thurr I took a shower, jumped out she in the bed
With a see-threw thong on looked at her and I said

[Chorus]
J/Weav:
Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me
I'm only one call away
Chingy:
You could, roll with, me, if you was my baby
J/Weav:
Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me
I'm only one call away
Chingy:
You could, roll with, me, if you was my lady x2

Girl recognize game before game recognize you
You dealin with a playa, true, now what you wanna do
We can kick it and go puff on a blunt
Oh you don't smoke? Grab a pint of henn and we can get drunk
Its up to you, I'm the man but baby just let me know
Cause if you got a attitude then I could treat you just like a ho
If ya rollin with me baby hop in its enough room
We can gaze at the stars and shine like the moon
Give me a chance to show ya and a chance to know ya
Just be true and theres nothing I wont do for ya
Some women like to play it foul
but them the kind I put in a place like a child don't worry be happy and smile

[Chorus]
J/Weav:
Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me
I'm only one call away
Chingy:
You could, roll with, me, if you was my baby
J/Weav:
Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me
I'm only one call away
Chingy:
You could, roll with, me, if you was my lady x4
