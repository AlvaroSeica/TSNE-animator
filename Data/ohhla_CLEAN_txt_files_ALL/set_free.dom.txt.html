[Dom Pachino]
Love could be beautiful, ain't it the shit
But when you fall out of love, ain't it a bitch?
We used to be so deep in love, how did it switch?
You used to do my laundry (you used to get my hair done)
You used to light up my skies, sorta like a flare gun
You used to be the bottom line, I couldn't compare none
You know how I like my steak (medium rare, hon')
You was loving the fact I cheffed it up in the kitchen
My pink salmon, taste like Emeril did
But the baby Dom P. did it, and don't you forget it
I love your negligee, it was fishnetted
Damn... you can so get it

[Chorus: Nina]
He's all I needed, (He's all I needed)
He's all I needed, (He's all I need)
He's all I needed, (All I need)
He sets me free (he, sets me free)

[Crunch Lo]
Aiyo, hey pretty girl, my name is Crunch Lo
I'm the dude from Staten Island with magnificent flow
Pardon self if I'm rude, I just like what I see
I hope you everything good that you appear to be
You go to work, got kids, do you handle your biz?
She responded "no doubt", from the whip to the crib
Plus I don't strip for dollars, she corporate white collar
I know I hit the jackpot as I soon as I hollered
She was bad, chinky eyes, fat ass and nice thighs
A mix black and boricua, fly mamacita
Her past, I explored that out
On the way to the telly where I wore that out
A stallion from the Remy, she love the thug in me
It's just a little respect, quote on quote to be polically correct
I'm so sex, and my Bonnie, my mami, my Hillary Rod
We wont fall out, like we Whitney and Bob, it's like

[Chorus]

[Nina]
I can't imagine, we've been at this
This ain't the only time, we've made up with a kiss
Me being without you, is something I can't risk
I need for him to see, that he's the only one for me

[Dom Pachino]
Yo, baby let me talk to you, before I tear ya back out
I'm try'nna kiss and make up, this ain't no time to act out
We both messed up, especially in the beginning
We can both act a fool, today you're losing, I'm winning
But, if I really walk out, you know what you'd be doing
Soaking that pillow up, blowing my phone up
For you being alone's rough, plus the rush that you get when I
Get ya open and wet, I did shit to ya that you never forget
Straighten you out, like ya hair being washed and set, take your virginity
While listening to Keith Sweat, you say there's other fish in the sea
But you're still caught in my net</pre>
