[Down]
Ah yeah
Everybody be calling us eses
What is an ese?
Do you know what an ese is?
Well, lay back
I'm about to let you know
I'm a take you on a lil' ride
Yo, check this out
This is the definition of a real ese

Chorus: Diamonique
Started in the west, somos Mexicanos
Everywhere you go, you gon' see Chicanos
Ball-headed, sleep, then ride in the lo-lo's
Ballin' so slow, gettin' down like the volos
An ese
Yeah-y-yeah-yeah
If you didn't know, now you know
The definition of an ese
Hey
What is it, what is it
What is it, what is it

(Verse 1)
The definition of an ese
Straight up cholo
Mexican hoods
Ballin' in the low-low
The definition of an ese
Creased-up Khakis
Nike Cortez's and white-tees
A ese
Tu sabes, a ball-headed loco
Hard as steel, growing up in the barrio
Got chrome D's in my
My sies-quarto
Now they're lowriding everywhere like a vato
The boulevard full of bad mamacitas
Probably got a oldie jam, playing out the speakers
He's a gangsta
An Aztec warrior
Brown and proud, always hold it down for his culture
Raza, homey
Aztlan represento
Hablando Spanglish
Escucha mi lingo
It all started en la costa oeste
And that's the definition of a real ese

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 2)
Got the O.G. Pachuco with the gangsta twist
Got the Ben Davis suit with the creases crisp
An ese
Don Juan with the ladies
Lay 'em in the cama til dawn, making babies
He gotta hustle for the cash, gotta feed familia
Mess around where the stash, she'll be quick to deal ya
An ese
Mexican-American
Puro Chicano
With stripes like a veteran
Sleeve down, tattoos tell his life story
Tag a set on the wall, that's his only glory
Cause mama prays to the Virgin Mary
She's worried
Because he's down to do anything necessary
Got enemies all around him
Plus the jura
Hasta la vista
A trip to la pinta
Known around the world as the hardest of gente
And now you know the definition of an ese

Repeat Chorus

[Down]
Yeah
And there you have it
Coming to you from the brown superhero
Write that one down in the dictionary, homie
Cause that right there
Was the definition of a ese
Straight up
Down, homie
A.K.A. Kilo
Straight up, straight down, brown, proud
Yeah
