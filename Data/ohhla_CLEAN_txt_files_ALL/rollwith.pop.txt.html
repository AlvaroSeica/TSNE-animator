(*talking*)
Uh nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga
Nigga, we some soldiers huh

[Hook - 2x]
You fucking with some soldiers, inflated face folders
Roll with us niggaz, or get rolled over
Bitch we'll fold ya, steady weaving and bobbing
With twin glocks, that'll leave a nigga forehead slobbing

[Buddah Man]
Who it be that's me nigga, from 12000 block
Bust shots and don't stop, till twelve thousand drop
Subject to catch me, in a 2002 drop
Palamene inside, penut butter top
I'm 18 young, I ain't 18 dumb
I got steam with infra' beams, and seventeen come
Hollow tips coming out, of a thirty round drum
When I drop a two hundred, and thirty pound some
A back street thug nigga, my fo'-fo' plug niggaz
Affiliated with killers, and punk foe mud sippers
Dice ice fine niggaz, creep up from behind niggaz
Don't need ice my heat, bling-bling blind niggaz
A pitbull full breed, mash on full speed
A hustler head buster, my heart pump block bleed
You slip fucked up, you might not luck up
My tool give head wounds, blowing niggaz the fuck up

[Hook - 2x]

[Big Bub]
When I'm dealing with cheddar, I'm on toes like slippers
Pyrex fo's, for 28 gram whippers
Avoiding these snitches, and two 22 tippers
Affiliated with killers, we choppers and ruger rippers
Snapping like alligators, and plugging niggaz like clippers
Heavyweight contenders, hard hitters and tooth chippers
Battleship sinkers, and potent pint sippers
20 inch rim feelers, and candy paint drippers
Nigga we Interstate skaters, dope game gladiators
Third time offenders, plus we brick penetrators
For seven figgas or greater, we annihilate blocks
Bigger niggaz with bigger glocks, and hollow tip shots
In the mix ready to bubble, like water in hot pots
Aggravated intoxicated, and pulling out stash spots
Automatic extended clips, with infrared dots
We grave diggers with twelve gauge slugs, and buck shots

[Hook - 2x]

[T-Pop]
I roll with real niggaz, I roll with ill niggaz
Bad to the bone, lunatics and trill niggaz
Cap peelers and drug dealers, that's my squad
I'm not Bin Laden, but I'll drop a bomb
Juve, that's not my name
The Juggler, and I'm bringing the pain
Switching lane to lane, catch you slipping it's over
Bitch I done told ya, I'm a Laf-Tex soldier
Whoa, slow that down lil' daddy
You moving kinda fast, but that's kinda loftly daddy
Living lavish in the game, I'm a outlaw
Plus Poppy, is a southpaw
That play the game raw, that's how the game goes
Putting the rap game up, in a figure fo'
I ain't no hoe boy, you better watch how you speak
Killers up on the creep, plus my pitbulls don't sleep it's on nigga</pre>
