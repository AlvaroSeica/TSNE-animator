[2D w/ choir building up]
I...

I neeeed a gun to keep myself from harm
The poor peo-ple are burning in the sun
But they ain't got a chance, they ain't got a chance
I need a gun, 'cause all I do is dance
'Cause all I do is...dance

[Children's Choir San Fernandez Youth Chorus]
I neeeed a gun to keep myself from harm
The poor peo-ple are burning in the sun
No they ain't got a chance, they ain't got a chance
I need a gun, 'cause all I do is dance
'Cause all I do is...dance

[Bootie Brown]
In my backpack, I got my act right
In case you act quite difficult
And your result weaken, with anger and discontent
Some are seekin in search of like Nimoy
I'm a peace-loving decoy, ready for retaliation
I change your whole location to a pine box six-under
Impulsive don't ask why or wonder
Orders given to me is strike
and I'm thunder with lightning fast reflexes
On constant alert from the constant hurt
that seems limitless with no drop in pressure
Seems like everybody's out to test ya 'til they see you break
You can't conceal the hate that consumes you
I'm the reason why you fill up your Isuzu
Chill with your old lady at the tilt
I got a 90 days extension
And I'm filled with guilt from things that I've seen
Your water's from a bottle, mine's from a canteen
At night I hear the shots ring so I'm a light sleeper
The cost of life seems to get cheaper
Out in the desert with a street sweeper
"The war is over," so said the speaker
with the flight suit on, maybe to him I'm just a pawn..
So he can advance
I remember when I used to dance
Man, all I want to do is dance

[Children's Choir San Fernandez Youth Chorus with 2D as-libs]
DAAAANCE!!
DAAAANCE!!
DAAAANCE!!
I need a gun to keep myself from harm
