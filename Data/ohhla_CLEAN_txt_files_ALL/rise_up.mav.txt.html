[Chorus: Akon]
Can you hear them now?!!! In the streets they riot they riot!
But we won't stay down! We rise up! We rise up!
Ain't no hidin out! When the walls on fire on fire!
We 'gon stand our ground! We rise up! We rise up!
(Ohhhhhhhh!!!!!) Hear them, comin in the dark, night!
And feel them, come from where we are!
Can you hear them now?!!! In the streets they riot they riot!
But we won't stay down! We rise up! We rise up!

[Verse One: Mavado]
Oh I hope and pray for a better day, and a better day will come!
How so many people dyin?! In the risin of the sun!
Oh and when they think it's over, this battle just begun!
Yes and we should keep on fightin, they could never shoot us down
I'm so solid as a rock now, and we only fight to win
Well then even if I buss this, God forgive me for my sin
In time, we shall seek we shall find, days amounted to climb
We shall leave no one behiiiiinnnnndddddddd!!!!!

[Chorus: Akon]
Can you hear them now?!!! In the streets they riot they riot!
But we won't stay down! We rise up! We rise up!
Ain't no hidin out! When the walls on fire on fire!
We 'gon stand our ground! We rise up! We rise up!
(Ohhhhhhhh!!!!!) Hear them, comin in the dark, night!
And feel them, come from where we are!
Can you hear them now?!!! In the streets they riot they riot!
But we won't stay down! We rise up! We rise up!

[Verse Two: Rick Ross] (Mavado) (*Rick Ross)
WOOOOOOO!!!! I know they wanna see me fall (Anywayyyyyyy!!!!!)
HUH! I know they wanna see me fail (Ayyyyyyyyy!!!!!!)
HUH! That's why I go so hard (GANGSTA!!!!)
Only the real will prevail
I will look up to the sky
Won't let no man give me hell (GULLY GOD!!!)
As I reach for my sword
Prophet gold in the pail (*WOOOOOOO!!!!)
I love ridin with the roof gone (YEAH!)
HUH! Count the money with my jewels on (YEAH!)
HUH! Might fuck her with my shoes on (YEAH!)
HUH! Dope boy need two phones

[Chorus: Akon]
Can you hear them now?!!! In the streets they riot they riot!
But we won't stay down! We rise up! We rise up!
Ain't no hidin out! When the walls on fire on fire!
We 'gon stand our ground! We rise up! We rise up!
(Ohhhhhhhh!!!!!) Hear them, comin in the dark, night!
And feel them, come from where we are!
Can you hear them now?!!! In the streets they riot they riot!
But we won't stay down! We rise up! We rise up!

[Verse Three: Mavado]
This one's for the people, send this for the have not!
Life is like a journey, life is all we got!
Oh but only if we rise up and fight together we could never stop!
If we back down for a minute, it will never stop!
They may try so hard to fight us, they will try so hard to win
Survive the desert like the cactus, fightin for the king

[Chorus: Akon]
Can you hear them now?!!! In the streets they riot they riot!
But we won't stay down! We rise up! We rise up!
Ain't no hidin out! When the walls on fire on fire!
We 'gon stand our ground! We rise up! We rise up!
(Ohhhhhhhh!!!!!) Hear them, comin in the dark, night!
And feel them, come from where we are!
Can you hear them now?!!! In the streets they riot they riot!
But we won't stay down! We rise up! We rise up!
