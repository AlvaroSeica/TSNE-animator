[Chorus]
I'm feelin it fill the glass to the top with Moet
Feelin it feel the Lex pushin up on the set
I'm feelin it through the high that you get from the lye
Feelin it if you feel it raise your l in the sky

[Verse 1]
I keep it realer than most I know your feelin it
Cristal's on ice I like to toast I keep on spillin it
Bonecrushers I keep real close, I got the skill for this
On my back the flyest clothes, lookin ill and shit
Transactions illegitimate cause life is still a bitch; and then you die
But for now life close your eyes and feel this dick
Since diapers had nothin to live for like them lifers but 
Makin sure every nigga stay rich within my cipher
We paid the price the circle of success they turned my mic up
I'm bout to hit these niggas with some shit that'll light your life up
If every nigga in your clique is rich yo' clique is rugged
Nobody will fall cause everyone will be each other's crutches
I hope you fools choose to listen I drop jewels bust it
These are the rules I follow in my life you gotta love it
Jiggy Jigga lookin gully in the joint 
If y'all niggas ain't talkin 'bout large money what's the point?

(Chorus)

[Verse 2]
Even if it ain't sunny hey I ain't complainin 
I'm in the rain doing a buck 40 hydroplanin what shorty
(Where you disappear son?)
Maintainin puttin myself in a position most of these rappers ain't in
I'm livin the ill streets blues got you hunger painin
Nothin to gain and a whole lot to lose you still singin fool
I'm thorough in every boro my name be ringin
Warmin it up for the perfect time to hit your brain and 
Ya Feelin it? to all the girls I bought the girdle to conceal my bricks
No doubt  they can vouch my life is real as shit 
95 south and poppy on the hill and shit
And all the towns like Cambridge that I killed wit shit
And all the thorough ass niggas that I hustle wit 
Throw your joints in the air one time and bust your shit
These fake rappers cant really know I'm lovin it ya feelin it

(Chorus) - repeat 2X

[Verse 3]
What y'all ain't heard that nigga Jay hot?
The Cristals they keep me wet like Baywatch
I keep it tight for all the nights my momma prayed I'd stop 
Said she had dreams a sniper hit me with a fatal shot
It was nightmares ma
Them dreams you say you got, give me the chills
But these mills, well they make me hot - y'all don't feel me?
Enough to stop the illin right
But at the same time these dimes keep me feelin tight 
I'm so confused; okay I'm gettin weeded now
I know I contradicted myself, look I don't need that now 
It's just once in a blue and it's nothin to do and
the tension gets too thick for my sober mind to cut through
I get to zonin - me and the chick on the L and then we're bonin
I freed my mind, sometimes I here myself moanin
Take one more toke then I leave that weed alone man
It got me goin shit

(Chorus) - repeat 3X</pre>
