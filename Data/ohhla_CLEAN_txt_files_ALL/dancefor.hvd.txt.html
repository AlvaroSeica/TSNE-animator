[Intro: Heavy D]
Talk with me, w-walk with me..
It's... uh-huh
Whoo! Whoo!
 
[Chorus: Toni J]
I would do a dance for you
Paint a portrait of a brand new you
You deserve an ocean view
I would swim it all for you
I love you so much better, baby
Yeah, I love you so much better
I love you so much better, baby
Yeah, I love you so much better
 
[Heavy D]
Huh, if I had to paint a picture
Brushstrokes that perfectly descript ya
Body like a sculpture, scripture
Had to pray on ya, before I got up on ya
Shoe store, your store, whatever fit ya
Yo' time, my dime, whoever with ya
Never divide the time to quit or split ya
{Shit} ya the best thing the ever happen to me
Now talk to me, walk with me...
 
[Chorus]
 
[Heavy D]
Yes, you've been the best, so fresh right to left
You eliminate the rest, and yes
Peel it apart, your own heart, tear it apart 
'til ain't nothin left, and yes
Bein without you instead of with you is equivalent to death
Civil unrest, heavy on the chest...
Now talk to me, walk with me...
 
[Chorus]</pre>
