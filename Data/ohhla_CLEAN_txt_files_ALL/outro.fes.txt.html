[Fes Taylor]
It's hip hop or the beat, like either you
Bop to the beat, or poppin' your heat, I box in your teeth
I get wop in the jeep, mom slobbing the meat
Wolves on top of your freak, it be unstoppable thief
Is it possible he, what they watching to see
Play it like monopoly, create our own democracy
Say I'm like a prophecy, fleeing from the cops, I'm free
When I'm dead, fossil me, so no living I can see
Gun smoke try to breathe, one poke dying breed
Plus wrote rhymes like these, to blow an MC
My flow feed families, fans need Gods like a coke head nose need candy
Til we reach brandy
Staten Island, never speak to Sandy
I'm trying to polly with Young Gotti and reach Miami
Listen, son, I'm trying to teach, that's what the plan be
And we never switch to Plan B, cuz Plan A'll get us each Grammy's</pre>
