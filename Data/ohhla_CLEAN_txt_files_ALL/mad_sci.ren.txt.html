[Intro: MC Ren]
uhh, uhh, yeah, yeah
 
[MC Ren]
Darkside, is where I'm comin' from all alone
Stranglin' niggaz that's fakin' on the microphones
Cause I been around and I'ma be around again
Who is it? -"MC Ren" - the black nigga that they call Ren
Won't be braggin' on the nine double M 
My steel toe kicks, turn tricks, I use sticks and stones
And say what's up, to my niggaz on the sidewalk
Put on my black to jack, so I can night-stalk
Cause to carry a big stick 
For niggaz that never shot a B.B. gun
Always talkin' about the trigger 
Just to get paid, they make it all routine
And if our record popped, they runnin' from the scene
There's too many records out, that ain't sayin' nothin'
And fake-ass radio stations ain't playin' nothin'
The shit gotta get back, it's time to MC
Aha, too many new niggaz ain't sure like I be
I wanna be L, and only care from the cream
Applause like a bitch, to get put in the magazine "what's up?"
You ain't Fresh, you ain't Ride On, you ain't The Source
Nigga wanted to get with me, but shit was hoarse
Lookin' at my cristal board for competition
Hypocrite niggaz hang around to get a listen
Tried to peep it in my note book, but lost a leg 
Got paralyzed neck up from what you read, a Mad Scientist
 
[Chorus: DJ Train Scratching and cutting quotes below]
Ren is in control, here we go again scarin' people to die --&gt; MC Ren
A fuckin' Mad Scientist
Ren is in control, here we go again scarin' people to die --&gt; MC Ren
 
[MC Ren]
Weak-ass niggaz keep eyein' this
But who can come and fade The Mad Scientist?
I been away from the public, cause I'm an enemy
With the black Beanie, disappear like Whodini
God of the universe, I control your soul
Shakin' niggaz up from the bottom of the North Pole
And my double S, four fifty four 
With my size ten, steel toe, shuffle through the floor
It's simple, don't wanna make it complicated 
Cause your simple minded niggaz might get frustrated
With your bang-bang boogie, cause Ren heard enough
Cause niggaz nowadays don't come with the funky stuff 
That I used to hear in '83 and '84
When shit had to be hardcore 
"Criminal Minded, you've been blinded" --&gt; KRS-One
I'm lookin' for some shit like that, but can't find it
"6'N The Mornin, police at my door" --&gt; Ice-T
Niggaz don't make that kind of shit no more 
Sippin-Ass-Niggaz make way, cause Ren don't play that shit
I'm screamin' Mayday, a fuckin' Mad Scientist
 
[Chorus: DJ Train Scratching and cutting quotes below]
Ren is in control, here we go again scarin' people to die --&gt; MC Ren
A Mad Scientist
Ren is in control, here we go again scarin' people to die --&gt; MC Ren
Ren is in control, here we go again scarin' people to die --&gt; MC Ren
Ren is in control, here we go again scarin' people to die --&gt; MC Ren
 
[MC Ren]
Sneaky sneaky, is how I creep up on you (*Cough*)
I clear my throat and then I drop bombs on you 
Now be honest, did you think the Villain will let
New niggaz come out and tear out the work? 
That I put in, I'll pick up the pen then I write 
Til the hand feels authorizers
Shit down and dirty, you would swear this appetites
I be creatin' what your body longs for 
And fake-ass niggaz, this is who the song's for
A Mad Scientist, but I won't make a Frankenstein 
I just write a rhyme that'll blow your fuckin' mind
You can't follow this, I didn't leave a scent
You can't fool the 5 percent, that me and Train repesent
I'm walkin' up right, and livin' civilized
The Messager Elijah, yo, done opened up my eyes 
Then the B-boys stance, on my throne in black
Niggaz scared as hell because the Villain is back 
From the center of the earth, I'm makin' way like the gopher
Nigga, by myself I'm takin' over
Ugh, a Mad Scientist
 
[Chorus: DJ Train Scratching and cutting quotes below]
Ren is in control, here we go again scarin' people to die --&gt; MC Ren
A motherfuckin' Mad Scientist
Ren is in control, here we go again scarin' people to die --&gt; MC Ren
A motherfuckin' Mad Scientist
Ren is in control, here we go again scarin' people to die --&gt; MC Ren  
    
[Outro: MC Ren Talking Overlapping the Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, I wanna say what's up to tribe of Shabazz
Yo, 1994, '95, A Mad Scientist</pre>
