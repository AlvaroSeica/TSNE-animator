My ears hear everything...
It's like fucking sonar!

Check it out

[Diabolic]
I seen a satanic mixture amongst the Catholic scriptures
So I'm flashing pictures of the Pope selling gas to Hitler
Force feed the proof, 33 mislead the youth
I'm the culprit who slit his wrists and plead the truth
Bleed the deepest roots with twelve to oversee
Went to hell opposing three while satan sells his soul to me
The devil's advocate rose from the dead a rebel passionate
A level pass this shit with a score to settle after it
Bush and Laden plotting to end contact
Intense combat means defense contracts
Beyond that a New World's captive effect
Where Police scam the beast brand on the back of ya neck
With cobras biting attack and infect your soul with spite
Till I rose the life of a poltergeist shedding Jehovah's Light
It's a true story I explore the honest approach
+Dance With The Devil+ and slit his choreographer's throat

It's where we at  you, you, you and me
It's a crew of three serving the truth for you to see
It's usually right there in front of your eyeballs
[Walk with me] wake the fuck up before the sky falls!

It's where we at  you, you, you and me
It's a crew of three bringing the truth for you to see
It's usually right there in front of your eyeballs
[Walk with me] wake the fuck up before the sky falls!

[Coal]
Look at the wither of my soul you'll see the pain in my eyes
But you will really feel my pain when fire rain from the sky
So embraced love before you get a taste of these fake thugs
Drowning in the Great Flood of snakes blood [Learn to swim]
The truth is vicious most of y'all turn superstitious
Been bothered by the sensitive Father and the youth it visits
Useless gimmicks trying to mimic the legends useless airplay 
[    transliteration     ] on heaven's stairway
To teach man about they deep plan 
Fabens on C-SPAN receive the beast brand in each hand
The concept of freedom is a complete scam
United we stand on our own while they clone our gene strand
I march allegiant to the darkness of Egypt
Snake rattling the golden apples in the Garden of Eden
What I feared sight when I grab the spear of pierce Christ
War chips on Joe Camel watch demons run for dear life
 
It's where we at  you, you, you and me
It's a crew of three serving the truth for you to see
It's usually right there in front of your eyeballs
[Walk with me] wake the fuck up before the sky falls!

It's where we at  you, you, you and me

[Taboo]
Imitation for you to stand in the grand Book of Life
Through the sun sacrifice cleanse myself in the blood of Christ
Till my garments turning white my diving right in mind's plight
Don't need your words or hindsight 
This Finite type of equation gazing at a New World invasion
Society and Jesus got my heart racing
Facing worldly extermination through my sperm germination
Trilateral connections, elections run my masons [All day]
Revelations, Counsel of Foreign Relations 
Where devils take vacations on camps at David's location
Trauma/patience but I'm a firm believer 
That the leaders in Geneva, prophesize like I was Peter
Strong as stone AIDS was made in the Club of Rome
The silent plague that was made to invade ya home
They're making clones, cell phones carry the +New Jack+ 
And George Bush, sr. was the first person who sold crack
Hold that, I'm just here to spark the beef
Tell you right now Star of David  mark of the beast
With 6 triangle X 3, start to believe
It has not the Jews just pharaohcy and High Priests

It's where we at  you, you, you and me
It's a crew of three serving the truth for you to see
It's usually right there in front of your eyeballs
[Walk with me] wake the fuck up before the sky falls!
