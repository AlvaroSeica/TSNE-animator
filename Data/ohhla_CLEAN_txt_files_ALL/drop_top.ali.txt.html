(Chorus x2 - Kandi)
Rollin' in a drop top, ol school on
20 inch, 100 spokes, all day long
I like, all the fly guys wit the rims and the beats
Million, candy paints, screens, wood, and leather seats (Leather seats)

(Verse 1 - Ali)
Yo, I'ma sucka for head wraps, no perms, just naps
Long shirt, fat ass, wit a brain to match
No poke, no soda, no talkin' back, grabbin' 'em out of college
I'm wisdom lookin' for knowledge, who got it
I got it, I love it when you get that Zippendale in ya body
And shakin' ya la-de-da-de, in the party
Gon' shawty, now throw it on me naughty
And if both of y'all together, I'm in the center like Jahadi
And I like that (Woo), plus the both of y'all so fine
Why should I bite back (Woo), I'm just waistin' my lines
And havin' time after time, I'm just speakin' my mind
It don't matter if I'm in the Range, or the Benz I'ma shine
Now ask, who that is, walkin' and talkin' that bull stuff
Somebody probably jealous 'cause they truck pulled up
Am I gon' sweat that, hell naw, I'm gon' go
Out the do', to the ride, and just roll (Let's roll)

(Chorus x2 - Kandi)
Rollin' in a drop top, ol school on
20 inch, 100 spokes, all day long
I like, all the fly guys wit the rims and the beats
Million, candy paints, screens, wood, and leather seats (Leather seats)

(Verse 2 - Ali)
Check, check, well I got no love for losin'
Never been full of hate, no love for uzi's
Wahchin' me again and again, like favorite movies
MC's wit brains, obsessed wit oochie coochie
(I got more flavor than them, motherfucker)
You other facts of life acts too (Too)
No but, no drink, I gets very moody
I guess that why, I'm in love wit Bud just like brew
Truly yours, see my concert be too packed, just like Shakur
What's in store, I'ma let jet like Acu-ra
Gas pedal hit the floor, zoom like the Camadors
See I'm your, Lunatic for hire
A ??? will call them MC's out like a bad umpire (You're outta here)
I snap neck, like a T roll before we retire
Oh Jim Carrey ass nigga, quit being a liar, liar
Am I gon' sweat that, hell naw, I'm gon' go
Out the do', to the ride, and just roll

(Chorus x2 - Kandi)
Rollin' in a drop top, ol school on
20 inch, 100 spokes, all day long
I like, all the fly guys wit the rims and the beats
Million, candy paints, screens, wood, and leather seats (Leather seats)

(Verse 3 - Ali)
Now for real, I be to break 'em off
Hoe hopper, trick knocker, nobody does like we do each proper
Think he like papa, when I drop her
Lyin' on that ass now we fuckin' 'til the beat don't stop her
Could it be I move too smooth, groove
That'll make the whole party move
Spots I keep 'em hot, so honey be hot to try
Pull up on the lot, black gloves and a glock
My crew stand up, y'all crew catch rounds
Desert Eg, 4 pound, it's got to, go down
Should I sweat that, hell naw I'm gon' go
Out the do', to the ride, and just roll

(Kandi w/ Ali talking in background)
Uh, Ali, Ali, keep rollin'
St. Lunatics, keep rollin'

(Chorus x2 - Kandi)
Rollin' in a drop top, ol school on
20 inch, 100 spokes, all day long
I like all the fly guys wit the rims and the beats
Million, candy paints, screens, wood, and leather seats (Leather seats)

Oh, Ali</pre>
