(Legs Diamond)
Legs Diamond in the house
And we sendin clown love out to Above the Law

(Violent J)
When I sit there and right the shit for the mic I hold
I make sure my beats are loud, and bold, and cold
Violent J is the name that I go by
Wakin up with blood on my hands and I don't know why
You motherfuckers tryin to get in my path
Don't be surprised when you get a shotgun up your ass
Instigators, I got one for that ass too
I'm gonna hang you from a street light, mangled and blue (eww)
You on my shit like a fiend coke
But if you say the wrong thing i'll put a slit in your throat
So, it's not the answer, no, i'm not a dancer, no
I'm not a hero, a zero , but I call myself a juggalo
And this is not a demo
ICP, Above The Law, we let it GO

(Chorus) 2x
Fantasizing, dramatizing, re-enacting MURDER MURDER

(Shaggy 2 Dope)
I feel actions, speak loud like words, and verbs and adjectives
They give the scrubs a chance to live
Not who's first, second or third
It ain't he said, and she said, fuck what you heard
When you live like that your life is mangled
In other words your neck is all tangled up
I ain't a hoe, I always go for mine
I was taught it's hard from the start, but you can always CLIMB

(Chorus) 2x

(Violent J)
Violent J, I break backs, back break with my crew
If i'm jumping in the pit then i'm gettin loose
Cause i'm takin out people, causing bodily harm
Making moves to improve the Dark Carnival brainstorm

(Shaggy 2 Dope) {Violent J}
I'm not inferior, not takin no shit
Last kid that tried to check me got his fuckin neck slit
{Powers my name, the clown be insane}
And if we get to panicking WE ALL GONNA REARRANGE

(The Ring Leader)
Ladies and gentlemen, introducing the Triple Threat!
The Wraith, The Great Milenko, and the Ringmaster!!

(Chorus) 2x</pre>
