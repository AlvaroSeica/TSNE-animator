Ya know, I'm really glad I got a chance to talk to you today
But every since you had that man at home ya know
things just ain't been the same, but um foreal
This ain't no other st. louis ish, this that pretty (laugh)

[Chorus]
Lay your body down and let me touch yo body (body, body)
And you know its goin down, and ain't nobody hurr to stop me (stop me, stop me)
And I know you heard about my freaky reputation (tation, tation)
but don't listen to the crowd because you know how they be hating on me

[Verse 1]
I know its been a minute since I spent some time with chu
but what I wanna do is make you screem out ooeeeooo
No need to rush it moma make everything suitable
Gotta let you know this propositions not refusable
We gonna play this song here
So you betta get cha body in heat
Get comfortable and have no fear
Cause you know it goin down in here so

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I know you heard about tamika and teresa too
Stephanie, candy, talisha, jasmine and Lesley too
Why don't you tell me mama what that gotta do with chu
You seem uncertain ma so why don't I give you a clue
I kiss it where the sun don't shine
After let my meat in You do mind
Turn over let me see it from behind
You'll ball a ? After this crime so

[Chorus]</pre>
