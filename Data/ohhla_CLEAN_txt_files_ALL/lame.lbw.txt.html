Typed by: AZ Lyrics

We the niggaz in the club, making it rain?
And y'all the niggaz in the club looking so lame?
Stop looking at my bitch dance bitch ass nigga?
Stop looking at my bitch dance what is he girls?
?He's a big L, big, big L ,?He's a big L, big, big L
?Hey, you's a big L, big, big L
?And we say, oh no, get him out of here

And I ain't never been a lame, and I'm far from a sucker?
You can call me mister always stunting on a motherfucker
?In the club, tin chains on?
Niggaz get the flexing?
Type of niggaz in the club with no girls in they section
?I be in miami south beach, wife beat, wildin out?
No job, 36, and still live in your mama house
you had to trick to hit it and for free she let me get it
If I get your girl one night with me
?I bet she won't forget it?
It's' the bow don't forget to wow?
Anybody know you been a lame for a while, ?
You's a big L, you the perfect definition in the club
?Fronting like you're smoking calli's, but he's [?]
?The boy around town, your reputation getting bigga?
You in to the club with no money, you can't even tip the stripper?
And if you see a lame go and put him in is place
make a L with your hand then put it in they face and tell them like

We the niggaz in the club, making it rain?
And y'all the niggaz in the club looking so lame?
Stop looking at my bitch dance bitch ass nigga?
Stop looking at my bitch dance what is he girls?
?He's a big L, big, big L ,?He's a big L, big, big L
?Hey, you's a big L, big, big L
?And we say, oh no, get him out of here

See I be looking at these guys like damn they lame?
Trying to stunt but we all know you rentin that chain?
Rocking knock off loui boy them ain't real clothes?
Now tell the truth, them cars on cribs ain't yours?
And it's a shame, how a person can be so lame
?In the dictionary, vision ain't next to lame?
It's sad when you hit them on the window shop
?A big L is the type that rat his boy to the cops?
With no girl getting ass weak ass niggaz?
stop fronting to the people keep it G my nigga
?I ain't never been the type, in my whole life
?Lied to the people just so I can earn stripes
?Whip game stupid, something I like to do it?
[?]
see a lame gonna put hem in it's place
make a L with your hand then put it in they face and tell them like

We the niggaz in the club, making it rain?
And y'all the niggaz in the club looking so lame?
Stop looking at my bitch dance bitch ass nigga?
Stop looking at my bitch dance what is he girls?
?He's a big L, big, big L ,?He's a big L, big, big L
?Hey, you's a big L, big, big L
?And we say, oh no, get him out of here.</pre>
