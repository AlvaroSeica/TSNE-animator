[Intro: Sticky Fingaz]
You can run, but you can't hide when you know it's comin!
It's comin! It's comin! It's comin!
You can run, but you can't hide when you know it's comin!
It's comin! It's comin! It's comin!
You can run, but you can't hide when you know it's comin!
It's comin! It's comin! It's comin!

[Verse One: Fredro Starr]
Look at what we started, this ain't for the weak hearted
Time to restart it, bring it bakc and recharge it
And recall us, we're gonna kill these weak artist
We are the street artist, here to peak this week's chart list
Charged with riot anxiety 'cause Onyx starts riots
And inggas know the good time to find it
Onyx get the crowd excited
And hype niggas up, and only loud niggas abiding
You got indicted for two counts of acting reckless
Snatch your necklace, you know I got the toast to pack a breakfast
The night says ghetto, where every nigga in they waste got a metal when you can't escape the ghetto
Where your trapped in where your into action
Ready for any interaction
We've got the gats when we enter the premises
Two shots make a family reminisce

[Chorus: Onyx &amp; Reks]
When they jump off (TAKE ONE FOR THE TEAM!!!)
One for the team! (TAKE ONE FOR THE TEAM!!!)
When they dump off (TAKE ONE FOR THE TEAM!!!)
One for the team! (TAKE ONE FOR THE TEAM!!!)
When they jump off (TAKE ONE FOR THE TEAM!!!)
One for the team! (TAKE ONE FOR THE TEAM!!!)
When they dump off (TAKE ONE FOR THE TEAM!!!)
One for the team! (TAKE ONE FOR THE TEAM!!!)

[Verse Two: Reks]
Reks! When they jump off and dump off, take one for the team
For the bloodline, the A-alike, the DNA the genes
Pledge allegiance any means a hostile Malik El-Shabazz
Proud to hold my beliefs and my peeps from the streets
Alot of Queens for regime stand solid
Our dream is just to dream without progress
Profit with my profits, buildin with disciples in the process
And Snowgoons souls turn blacker than the Onyx
Master the ebonics and the violence intervention
Death talks similiar to climate
Climate to the summit, to drama climax
They see the jewels tell you run it
Know deep know your mind you don't want it
Yappin your mouth is cheap momentum you get confronted
Your not a thug, 'cause you come from it
You gotta hold down, you great now
Where you gonna be when it go down?

[Verse Three: Sticky Fingaz]
I thought it was a wrap but hip hop kept callin me
I'm Pookie, smoke everything on a song with me
So I started thinking something wrong with me
But no! I got a feel in the show
Kill a man your a murderer kill them all your a God
I was raised behind bars, born in the yard
And they take me that long to be all of the yard
Now who you know that it's hard for me?!
Divine intervention nobody fathered me!
I'm a psychic, you don't want to start with me!
I could tell your future it's gonna end horribly!
I'm always in the crowd 'cause I dive on my fans
Niggas don't wanna battle 'cause I rhyme with my hands
Hit you with the punchline, all open hand
Love me or hate me I don't give a damn
 
[Chorus: Onyx &amp; Reks]
When they jump off (TAKE ONE FOR THE TEAM!!!)
One for the team! (TAKE ONE FOR THE TEAM!!!)
When they dump off (TAKE ONE FOR THE TEAM!!!)
One for the team! (TAKE ONE FOR THE TEAM!!!)
When they jump off (TAKE ONE FOR THE TEAM!!!)
One for the team! (TAKE ONE FOR THE TEAM!!!)
When they dump off (TAKE ONE FOR THE TEAM!!!)
One for the team! (TAKE ONE!!!)</pre>
