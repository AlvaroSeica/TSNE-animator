[Intro: 2Pac]
Picture me rollin' (rollin', rollin', rollin)

Yeah, clear enough for ya (Is that right)
(Hahahahaha) Yeah
(Hehehehe) Why niggaz look mad (Is that right)
Y'all supposed to be happy I'm free!
Y'all niggaz look like y'all wanted me to stay in jail, hahah!
Hoe bustaz

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Picture me rollin in my 500 Benz
I got no love for these niggaz, there's no need to be friends
They got me under surveillance, that's what somebody be tellin
Know there's dope bein sold, but I ain't the one sellin!
Don't want to be another number
I got a fuckin gang of weed to keep from goin under
The federales wanna see me dead - niggaz put prices on my head
Now I got two Rottwilers by my bed, I feed em lead
Now I'm released, how will I live Will God forgive me
for all the dirt a nigga did, to feed kids
One life to live, it's so hard to be positive
when niggaz shootin at your crib
Mama, I'm still thuggin, the world is a war zone
My homies is inmates, and most of them dead wrong
Full grown, finally a man, just scheamin on ways
to put some green inside the palms of my empty hands
Just picture me rollin
Flossin a Benz on rims that isn't stolen
My dreams is censored, my hopes are gone
I'm like a fiend that finally sees when all the dope is gone
My nerves is wrecked, heart beatin and my hands is swollen
thinkin of the G's I'll be holdin, picture me rollin

[Chorus: Butch Cassidy]
When I pull in you will know it's me
Trust me, I'm cruising down the block in my fleet
Moored with two bros
Down for the dose
This is how us gangstaz roll
Picture me rolling (Picture me rollin')

When I pull in they be hating on me
Hiding in the cut contemplating on me
Wanting my ride
Wanting my dough
Testing my class for sure
Forever I'm rolling

[Verse 2: Kurupt]
It's a tidal on the gain
People coming in packs
Looking for a reason to try to jack
I got my hand on the squeezer
Young Ebenezer
I got rash at this krill
Leukemia Emphysema
Out the barrel of the 44
I'm on fire like a fever
I'm a gangster
A woman is a given
A brand new S-Class on the low we getting past
Niggaz mad at me
Yeah they hating class
But all I want you to do is just watch me
As I'm rolling by dipping getting high
Me a super fly
But do we fly getting super high
Ready for a ride, won't you get inside
Brand new twisters on the feet
With the beat just bumping down the street
With nothing but weed
It's just a bomb ass day
But niggaz still upset
I don't know why
Mama just forgive me if I have to cruise
Thing out and mission semis up the steps
I don't want to leave you alone
But see it's me or him
All I want to say is its either me or him
But I'm trying to do what I do without seeing the pen
Just rollin'(rollin', rollin')

[Chorus: Butch Cassidy]
When I pull in you will know it's me
Trust me, I'm cruising down the block in my fleet
Moored with two bros
Down for the dose
This is how us gangstaz roll
Picture me rolling (Picture me rollin')

When I pull in they be hating on me
Hiding in the cut contemplating on me
Wanting my ride
Wanting my dough
Testing my class for sure
Forever I'm rolling

When I pull in you will know it's me
Trust me, I'm cruising down the block in my fleet
Moored with two bros
Down for the dose
This is how us gangstaz roll
Picture me rolling (Picture me rollin')

When I pull in they be hating on me
Hiding in the cut contemplating on me
Wanting my ride
Wanting my dough
Testing my class for sure
Forever I'm rolling</pre>
