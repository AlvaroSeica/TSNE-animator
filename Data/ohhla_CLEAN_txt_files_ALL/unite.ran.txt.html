Time out bro y'all need to cut it out
I've been searching for awhile to tell you what I've figured out
earlier I came across some unknown robot masters
must be from your world sonic..wiley that bastard
see,these guys were strong and dangerous
don't you see it in his eyes that he's one of us?
kinda blue like you,and you a bro to me
make me feel like we all on the same team
so sonic, whose these friends your looking for?
must be the ones I came across
I knew there was something off
I've never seen these ones before..oh..yea
they mentioned some robotnik
guess him and wiley teamed up and they made your friends robotic
got them stealing gem stones,damn we need to end this
if not... I feel this world we're in will be ending
don't know how but they made our worlds collide
if y'all keep fighting they'll make sure this world do divide
into pieces
this battle needs to cease, so peace it
cause only if you two team up will these two be defeated.

No more fighting, it's time to unite
No more fighting, it's time to unite
the icons need to save the world
before the evil Docs take over the world

Bummer majores, not in a rad way
This some bad news, it's a sad day
I'm this close to being traumatized
The S-o-n-I-c team got robotisized
I really wish that this was all a dream
I am sick and tired of dr eggmans schemes
And this wily guy..sounds no good
Goin by the name alone you can tell he's no good
Gettin all 7 emeralds equals trouble
We need stop this before earth turns into rubble
Aye proto man thanks a lot you're a life saver
We prolly would've done something we regret later
It's about that time for both worlds to unite
Thats The only f'n way that we can win this fight
..We really have no time to play so
mega man lets peace it up, what do ya say bro..

No more fighting, it's time to unite
No more fighting, it's time to unite
the icons need to save the world
before the evil Docs take over the world

[Ran]
Guess we got to to unite
Time to show and prove right
It's goin down tonight
These doctors just do right
We slip inside real smooth like
All they see is blue lights
We too nice
Wily's off and egg man ain't wrapped too tight
We..
Come together like magnets cause
We ain't havin it
Doc got us fighting like savages
While they plot and plan
I just stand
Hand on my buster waiting
I'm saying it's so frustrating
Proto thank you for interrupting brother
We gone need saving
I'll gladly put down my weapon
If you slow down a second
If we team up I reckon
We'd be the best, no question
Join forces and torch this establishment
Chaos emeralds,Robot masters
It's, an embarrassment
Dismantle em before our time is up
Got a mega team up, tear the scene up, make em believe us
Mega man and sonic got a nice ring to it
Get into it
This track would make some nice theme music

[CHORUS]
No more fighting, it's time to unite
No more fighting, it's time to unite
the icons need to save the world
before the evil Docs take over the world</pre>
