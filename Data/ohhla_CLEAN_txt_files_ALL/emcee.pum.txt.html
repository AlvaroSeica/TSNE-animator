[Pumpkinhead]
Picture a crown flooded with rubies and diamonds
On top of the dome of this man that's rhymin
That signifies I'm in a bracket, beyond your mediocre back-packing emcees
Sorry for crackin your teeth
I got a back smackin disease
And it flairs up when I hear a rapper spit wacker than me
And don't fit the category, that is corny
When a-nother emcee try to test me
But y'all, don't impress me, heavens to Betsy
Y'all better jet-ski, pull a disappearin act like Wesley
Before a nigga gets back his swagger and steps up the ladder
Grandma, get the camera!
And take a flick of your baby boy doin his thing
Lookin like my dad, I swear we one in the same
And my son is the same
When we shine the sun dries up the rain and it'll brighten your day
Yo I do this for my bro's locked up in chains
And I do it for emcees that grew up on Kane
I do this for my brothers that sniff dust and 'caine
And fucked up they brain, let's make a change
My needles only test the wax that'll touch my veins
DP gives a scratch {*DP One scratches* - "Yeah"}
Give it up to a brother that avoided the vultures
And'll rep, every step of this hip-hop culture

[Chorus 2X: Pumpkinhead]
I'm a E-M-C-E-E
A smooth operator operatin correctly
And I rep the four elements so nigga respect me
It'll take more than your intelligence to test me

[Pumpkinhead]
I'm an emcee, but started out as a B-boy
Windmillin, back spinnin on linolium towel boy
Adidas Shelltops, fat laces crossed over
Designer checker-box, my boombox would knock
It woke up like half of my block
I put my best foot forward, but my hip wasn't hop
Shit was on lock, most of my boys, kept pistols on cock
At local hookey jams - when kids did the wop
And we stopped and we watched and we wopped and we rocked
And quickly went from Shelltops to Reeboks, S-curls to hightops
Black leather medallions with the African in it
I laughed cause I lived it and you didn't
I made it a long way, and I can't stop man
I "Refuse to Lose" like Chuck D - I'm a strong black man!
First and foremost, I'm still a hip-hop fan
This year Puffy went from "Making Da Band" to he's in a band
Some say that he fakes, some say that he's great
But I'll be damned if I walk to Brooklyn to get your rich ass some cheesecake
That's not hip-hop
That's the type of shit that make me wanna not hip-hop
It make the government in protest and stop hip-hop
You don't gotta agree with me Mr. P. Diddy
Toe-to-toe lyrically your artists can't compete with me
I'm faster, I'm the master, y'all rappers and I'm a

[Chorus]

[Chorus] - whispered

{"E-M-C-E-E"}
{"A smooth operator operatin correctly"}</pre>
