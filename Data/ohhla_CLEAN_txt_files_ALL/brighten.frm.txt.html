[Verse One: Need Not Worry]
He came home from school and he heard the bad news
sad but true, he really not known to
deal with the situation, boy can't cry
when he did for a little bit but then it passed by
life has changed living on his own planet
kickin and he slammin, yo he's straight van damme'in
he couldnt grieve, fuck he couldnt even breath
cus all he did was fill (havoc from mob....(madd empty bags of weed))
A high school sweet teen turning to a street fiend fast
skipping every high school class
last but not least, a 12 yard dash
to feed the fiends and make the quick fast cash
smoking in the bathroom sipping on a 40
more naughty than the song "me so horny"
spiral...out of control... a young soul
who couldnt warmen when his world got cold

hook: 8 bars accompanied by crew
........Now he's gonna brighten up the sun
(every other bar)...therefore repeated 4 times.but the hook spans 8 bars

[Verse Two: Need Not Worry]
We go round a bout, we got a fresh pot brewed
it was sad but true, he's just a drug deal dude
and tall paul's gone within the eye of the storm
he rock, rock on, he want to righten up the wrong
It's gonna take a long time, he's abrasive
just smoking a little bit of weed in his basement
a little analyitcal of how his mental state been
staying off the corner and evading all his main men
his main man got knocked, 5 to 10
so it took him out a little bit from what he done did
like the automobile grand theft to armed robberies
know he better off with lifestyle of mediocraty
bare essential, back to school and residential
paul up out the picture makes it easy for the let go
..a trife life making moves and such
he getting back into the swing of things and moving on up/ (because)

hook:  8 bars accompanied by crew
........Now he's gonna brighten up the sun
(every other bar)...therefore repeated 4 times.but the hook spans 8 bars

[Verse Three: Need Not Worry]
Now he back in school to straighten up a little bit
won't quit, one year left to be on some legit shit
months after...the robbery that captured....
his man, he on the brink of honor roll stature
a plan mastered, college is attracting
spun full circle, now he not a thief bastard
slowly...but surely,  smoothin out the edginess
stay a little jagged for he sleeping with the skeletons
he working thru it, he do a little dirt...
to keep level..not to the extent of being rebel
cool,calm,collected...he not getting arrested
making better selections, living thru a lesson
stay in classrooms no smoking in the bathroom
back pack fool, now focused with an attitude
he writes letters to paul and stays honest
and after 12th grade he went straight to college.(accompanied by pete rock from d/w/the kings)

hook to fade.....as many bars as we like son!!</pre>
