Typed by: vincientoarmaniwindbreaker@yahoo.com

[Chorus 4X: Branden M. Collins]
I will never change, I will stay the same
No matter what they want me to sing
I'ma do my thing

[Verse 1: Danny!]
They say the kid ain't nice
'Cause he don't ever rap about the black man's plight
Or, Zataran's Rice
Or, any other underground rap cliche
I catch flack for the tracks I make, I'm sad to say, but

[Chorus]

[Danny!]
Check it
If you rap you're either militant with fascist views
Or a ringtone rapper making tracks for food, and umm
I never followed what the masses do
That's why the kid get lifted when a few cats get it, but
Critics still sayin' that I lack substance
This track's just, my proverbial butt to kiss
I will never change

[Chorus]

[Danny!]
How you mad 'cause D. Swain ain't the same as y'all?
This whole album doesn't sound remotely close
To these self-righteous rappers with their okie-dokes
That wanna clown 'cause they album sound extra extra underground
Boom bibbity bap, and that's that
I think their straps need to be loosened 'cause backpacks
Is not what defines me, yeah I miss the nineties
But I ain't tryin' to be another MC whining
Instead I move forward, call it progressive-hop
The only reason that I profess I'm hot?
Really it's two things: I wanna be felt from here to Europe
And I could give a fuck about these cryin'-ass purists
Talkin' 'bout they on a mission to recapture the essence
Nigga? I'm tryin' to send these young children a message
So you can keep your little niche market, shit's retarded
Why settle for a paper plane when you can whip a starship, nigga?

[Chorus]

[Bridge: Danny!]
You got me goin' out my mind...

[Verse 2: Kid Syc]
They said, "Syc, take it down a notch
Make it easier for me to figure out what you're talkin' about
I'm so used to crankin' it and walkin' it out that
All this thinkin' is making me nauseous"
Thank you, it ought to
You thought that I was playin'
When I said I was the sickest when I'm crankin' out these hits?
Hit you with a little somethin' different, it's a shock to your system
Y'all adjust in just a couple minutes
Allow me to justify position that I sit in
I figure with no father figure
Shit's a little harder if I noticed
But pretend I never noticed
I'm a heartless nigga
That is not at all a description I wanna fit in
Never one to fit into the crowd
The clever one that knows
Until I'm underground my job is never done
So devoted, just know that if I wrote it
Then I hold it sorta close to my aorta for the moment
You're arrested by the flows, need a EKG
Feel that beat in the middle of your chest
It's the lesson, it's the message
It's best that you get it in your head
They said "it's all the same"
My sentiments exactly, and I will never change

[Chorus]

[Outro: Branden M. Collins]
I will never ever change
No, no
I will never ever ever change
Oh, fuck y'all niggas</pre>
