[Intro]
The meaning of a modern day mercenary
like thuggin' in the club, they love to be scary
(Yeah. It's coming back to me, we gon' ride this, only one
(Bizzy, Bizzy)

Mercy Mary, there she, very weary, really wish you would tell me
Drama prepared me, momma she loves me
Mercy Mary, Mercy Mary, Mercy Mary, Mercy Mary (Ha ha. Off the top!)

[Chorus]
Mercy Mary, there she, very weary, really wish you would tell me
Drama prepared me, momma she loves me (No mercy)
Mercy Mary, there she, very weary, really wish you would tell me
Drama prepared me, momma she loves me (C'mon, man) Have no mercy.)

Carry my baby where ever my baby need to go, go, go, go, go, go
Carry my baby where ever my baby need to go, go, go, go, go, go (Ha ha ha.)

[Bizzy Bone]
The meaning of a modern day mercenary, like thuggin' in the club, they love to be scary
Baby if you ever settle to the level with the rebel, please fuck it up, very weary
Call it conceeded, but baby, I'm just weeded
Needed to pass over dose, P.O.D'ed
Hypno' and Moet jewel, for the few gon get from Cleveland
All we are is Mo' Thug, kickin' off 7 Sign Regime
It's the mercenary of the whole team, and I puff the green, until we all with kings in the seas
Problems, all I need's a revovler, bullet to solve-ah
Lil' petty-ass motherfuckers, all in the wrong, y'all don't better bust, no drama
To the pack of Dom of Perignon or Murielle, it's all here
Ain't no Hollywood, my baby, this' Holly'hood
And the souls got hustlin'
Can you feel that Mista Ripsta? Heh... ya'll, just can't breathe, heh...
I'll be ready to d-lo these, please, rest in peace
In a death the souls will increase 'till they each get ready for the son of Mary
Hurry in the case of each of my mercenaries
Mercenary, Mercy Mary
Mercy Mary, mercenary

[Chorus]
Mercy Mary, there she, very weary, really wish you would tell me
Drama prepared me, momma she loves me
Mercy Mary, there she, very weary, really wish you would tell me
Drama prepared me, momma she loves me

Carry my baby where ever my baby need to go, go, go, go, go, go
Carry my baby where ever my baby need to go, go, go, go, go, go (Ha ha ha.)

[Bizzy Bone]
Yo' whether they like or not, they gotta leave us alone, Hey
Let's tell 'em ''Get up off of our ass'' And what if don't say?
What do they know about love? What do they know about home, home?
Beautiful doves and plenty of love, I'll say it again if you want now come on
I'm loyally walkin' and prayin' and talkin' about my day upon my heartache
Kinda had saw, my feet is my car, we specially dark (Shh, ah)
But people they saw me again and they get on the road, you already know
The quicker, the better, I'm feelin' about, but I live in the drop the bomb
(Ring the alarm) Nobody is better we keepin' it movin'
its hard as ever, forgive what I've done and repent in our dues
and know what I do's, and keepin' it cool
Now what do we loose? We keepin' it movin' and rappin'
So, Lord forgive what I done
We singin' our dues and living our dues
Tell me, what do we choose? Mercenary, Mercy Mary
Mercy Mary, mercenary
Carry my baby where ever my baby need to go (Carry my baby.) Go, go, go, go, go

[Chorus]
Mercy Mary, there she, very weary, really wish you would tell me
Drama prepared me, momma she loves me (No mercy)
Mercy Mary, there she, very weary, really wish you would tell me
Drama prepared me, momma she loves me (C'mon, man)

Carry my baby where ever my baby need to go, go, go, go, go, go
Carry my baby where ever my baby need to go, go, go, go, go, go (Ha ha ha.)

[Bizzy Bone]
They keep on tellin' me I don't know nothing, I like that, but I write that
Jesus insight that, and baby Bryon, you can go and resite that
Yeah, to the pipeline, tell 'em how much you love me
Gotta string on chain gang
Pauly, I know you'll hug me
All cynical, so political; Let me tickle your mind
I'm kissin' the ground, I love you daddy, The Lord is so profound
Stay out of that flesh for me, no problem, gonna let 'em pass 'em
My oppression is fitted with fine brass (Whoo) at last

[Chorus]
Mercy Mary, there she, very weary, really wish you would tell me
Drama prepared me, momma she loves me (No mercy)
Mercy Mary, there she, very weary, really wish you would tell me
Drama prepared me, momma she loves me (C'mon, man)

Carry my baby where ever my baby need to go, go, go, go, go, go
Carry my baby where ever my baby need to go, go, go, go, go, go (Ha ha ha.)

[Outro]
Ha ha. There's plenty awards man, trying to tell you right know
I like this shit man, I like this shit man, One love
