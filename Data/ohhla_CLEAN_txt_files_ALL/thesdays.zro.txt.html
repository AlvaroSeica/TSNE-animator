[Chorus]
And these days-seem like where ever I go
the fake takin'over like real ain't cool no mo'
And these days-don't nobody show love
instead of lendin'a helpin'hand they wanna see blood
And these days-I know that God be so mad
'Cause daughters disrespect they mothers,like sons do they Dad's
And these days-I just don't know what to do
I'm strugglin'just to make it homie,what about yoooou
 
(Verse)
These days seem like the definition of real done changed
like today it's cool to drop salt on ya potna's name
it's cool to shake ya homie hand,but then go sex his dame
she pregnant and yo'homie think it's his-that's a damn shame
seem like today it's cool to be gay
'cause these women be havin mo'women then Joseph Mcvey
and it seems like none of my homies ain't potna's no mo'-they all enemies
actin'like they down with me,I know they just pretend to be
Mama get beat by Dad,and you look just like you're father-so mama treat you bad
you feel like you're somethin'you're parents-wish they never had
that's the reason you out all night,and never at the pad-ready to whoop somebody's ass
but that ain't the solution
then you'll be like me and end up in an institution
No I don't know you I'm just tryna make a contribution
hopin'you don't end up on death row-lookin at execution-lethal injection or electruction
or even worse,somebody you disrespected comes and puts you in the dirt
I know if you can't get rid of ya tension-livin hurts
just try to vent you're frustration-doin somethin'that won't prepare you to ride in a hearse
it's easier said then done,soon as you solve a problem-you're facin another one
deal with one playa hater and here another one comes
deservin a whole cake,but end up with nothin but crumbs-I know you feel like ya done
but the Devil is a lie-tryna make you think he's down with you-and God wants you to die
but tell me why he sent his son here to be crucified
on a cross with a crown of thorns on his head,and a spear in his side-he hung,bled,and died
but it ain't gon'never change
those of us who are hard headed gon'end up in the flame
worshippin'idol god's like power and money mayne
I did it myself but realized that I had to change
knowin my people won't do the same
 
[Chorus]
And these days-seem like where ever I go
the fake takin'over like real ain't cool no mo'
And these days-don't nobody show love
instead of lendin'a helpin'hand they wanna see blood
And these days-I know that God be so mad
'Cause daughters disrespect they mothers,like sons do they Dad's
And these days-I just don't know what to do
I'm strugglin'just to make it homie,what about yoooou
I did it myself but realized that I had to change-knowin my people won't do the same
 
[Chorus]
And these days-seem like where ever I go
the fake takin'over like real ain't cool no mo'
And these days-don't nobody show love
instead of lendin'a helpin'hand they wanna see blood
And these days-I know that God be so mad
'Cause daughters disrespect they mothers,like sons do they Dad's
And these days-I just don't know what to do
I'm strugglin'just to make it homie,what about yoooou</pre>
