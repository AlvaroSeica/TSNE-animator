When you leave my colors fade to gray 
Numa numa ay, numa numa numa ay 
Every word of love I used to say 
Now I paint it everyday

Ma-ia-he, Ma-ia-hu, Ma-ia-ho, Ma-ia-haha

Hello, salute, it's me your babe
And I made something that's real to show you how I feel
Hello, hello, it's me Alina, I will paint my words of love
With your name on every wall

When you leave my colors fade to gray 
Numa numa ay, numa numa numa ay 
Every word of love I used to say 
Now I paint it everyday
When you leave my colors fade to gray 
Hey my lover stay or all my colors fade away 
Every word of love I used to say 
Now I paint it everyday

Ma-ia-he, Ma-ia-hu, Ma-ia-ho, Ma-ia-haha
Ma-ia-he, Ma-ia-hu, Ma-ia-ho, Ma-ia-haha

I sold my strings, my songs and dreams 
And I bought something to match the colors of my love
Hello, hello, it's me Alina, I will paint my words of love 
With your name on every wall
