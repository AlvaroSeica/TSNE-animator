Song:   Even On a Rainy Day
Typed by: OHHLA

I do try to relax but I get up and move instead
Yeah it helps to forget what's going on upstairs
Cause my life is spent around achieving those highs
I never let her play on my mind
Play on my mind, you should come here and say hi
Cause even on a rainy day, when the shades are grey
I will dance away, I will dance away
I won't take away when I'm making shapes
I will dance away
I'll be dance like, and we jiggle like
and we bop like, and we skank like
and we jive like and we swing like, and we dance like

Yeah, I'm quick and clever like the British weather
Innit yeah I'll get you in to kicks but you ain't cinderella
Better pick'n'mix a blender make the chicks look better
Thinking about the theory, makes me wish that I was pissed forever
There's a girl I liked in class we used to sit together
I made stuff up so she would think I would a mystic fella
Only recently we spoke her name was rose and yeah
she got the seal of approval when she kissed it better
What, what, yeah, I kill it
Turnin words into pictures like I was flippin hieroglyphics
Ever since I was kiddish now I'm rhyming sickest
Your girl text me with like nine kisses I'm with it!

My life is spent around achieving those highs
I never let her play on my mind
Play on my mind, you should come here and say hi
Cause even on a rainy day, when the shades are grey
I will dance away, I will dance away
I won't take away when I'm making shapes
I will dance away
I'll be dance like, and we jiggle like
and we bop like, and we skank like
and we jive like and we swing like, and we dance like

I'm bringing the golden age, I know that England's cold but hey
I'm here to try and scold your face
With punches that can roll a paste
On the oldest day nothing much was golden
but the rings that the boys were holding would leave a inprint in your forehead yeah
The ones I tried to mimic but I would like to visit
The golden age the market vibe though catch it init
Your there for times of thinking and maybe lifes the shittest
but then I see the brighter side and try to smile its wicked!

My life is spent around achieving those highs
I never let her play on my mind
Play on my mind, you should come here and say hi
Cause even on a rainy day, when the shades a Gray
I will dance away, I will dance away
I won't take away when I'm making shapes
I will dance away
I'll be dance like, and we jiggle like
and we bop like, and we skank like
and we jive like and we swing like, and we dance like</pre>
