[Chief] Grandma!
[G'maC] Nigga~! Bring yo' butt home
[Chief] Yo Grandma I'll call you back {*click*}
[Chief] I gotta call Earl first

{*scratching*}

[Chief Chinchilla]
I swear to God I ain't never gon' drink
Just as long as I live
Fuck fuckin 40's, fuck all that shit
{*puking*}

Whew, ahh, damn, what time the liquor sto' close?
Go get me another 40 or somethin, shit!

[singing]
Drunk last night
And drunk the night before
I'm gonna get drunk tonight
Like I never got drunk before! {*echoes*}</pre>
