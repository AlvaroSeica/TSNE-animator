[Intro: Pitbull]
Mr. Worldwide... Akon

[Akon]
Hello! My name is not Mr. Right
But you can be my Mrs. Tonight
I know! We're only foolin around
I'm never gonna be your Mr. Right but I'ma be your
Mr. Right Now {*echoes until Pit raps*}

[Pitbull]
I've broken rules, I've broken laws
I've broken hearts, I've broke it all
And if you put me on baby I'll break you off
This is Mr. Todo Mundo, take it off
Ha ha~! You know the game plan
I'm a quarterback with options
I wanna go deep, hail mary, amen!
But tell your friend don't block us
I promise she can watch us
You know what time it is with no watches
I'm not Mr. Righteous
I'm Mr. Right Now, baby, gracias

[Chorus: Akon]
My name is not Mr. Right
But you can be Mrs. Tonight
I know! You're lookin for a good guy
But I can guarantee a good time
Hello! My name is not Mr. Right
But you can be my Mrs. Tonight
I know! We're only foolin around
I'm never gonna be your Mr. Right but I'ma be your
Mr. Right Now {*echoes until Pit raps*}

[Pitbull]
Mami you can't be seriously
lookin for somethin serious me
I'm a lot of fun
Best thang, no headaches, I hit and run
Ha ha ha! You can thank me later
Give me a second let me thank these haters
Thank you! I can push, pull, nibble, lick
bite, OH, and spank you
You can call all your girls over, dale
Let me buy them a drink too
I'm not Mr. Right
I'm Mr. Right Now, baby, thank you

[Chorus]

[Outro 4X: Pitbull]
Un besito mami (hello!)
No se a mala

[Akon]
I'm never gonna be your Mr. Right but I'ma be your
Mr. Right Now</pre>
