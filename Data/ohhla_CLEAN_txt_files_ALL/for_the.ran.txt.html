Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh
From sittin on the floor gamin
To droppin some of the highest scores the world had ever seen
To droppin some of the craziest verses rap had ever heard
From Woodstock, a good block since '82; they know me well
though they don't do what they say they do
My only hell is not bein called the crazy dude - oh naw
For all the cats that work a 9 to 5, but still
be standin in line at midnight - oh that's real
Want to be the first to master it, GameFAQS'n it
Haters call you addicts but, I just know you passionate
So I made a song for y'all cats, haters can fall back
Gamin since the 80's wish that I could bring 'em all back

[Chorus]
It's for the gamers - though gettinh up for work is a struggle
Playin all night 'til you come down with carpal tunnel
This for the gamers - who forsake meals and sleep
to beat a game they only had a week, so peep
This for the gamers - play a game and beat it
But won't stop 'til they unlock all the achievements, believe it
This for the gamers - Warcraft to Madden, well a-let me at 'em
All I gotta do is find a pattern

[int80 of dualcore]
This the for gamers, experts, n00bs and the griefers
Protection defeaters, all us, hackers and cheaters
I've got bad habits, lots of tools in my backpack
Distributing AIM bots and seeding out a map pack
Up for a fair game, if you got the skills
But I like to give the playing field a little bit of tilt
Cause winning's an addiction; I like to feel the thrill
So step up if you want, though I'll crush you when you will
You on point, Ran? (All the time, Int) Okay
Well I got your back, supplies are packed, consider me your sidekick
Victory is flawless, no one's gonna stop us
Strong through the gauntlet, no need for being cautious
Arcade to console to PC I'll join
It's offense and D, both sides of the coin
Another round or not, I should really save my voice
Press start or call it quits, time to make a choice

[Schagger the Darklord]
I got them nervous tics and twitchin with them bloodshot eyes, not
much of a surprise, got to bed at five and I'm shot
By nine I'm in trouble, strugglin just to adjust
I'm seein stuff I don't trust, but soldier through it I must~!
X's and circles and squares float in the air and they glow so intense
And I'm so intent on getting through this QuickTime event
Ammo and health items are everywhere, and I swear
That I can climb that wall right over there like I am Altair
PMC's are sweepin but I find my way by 'em
Trying to grapple gargoyles like I'm in Arkham Asylum
Spying Black Mesa gunships hover in the sky and
I am shoppin every merchant asks "What are you buyin?"
I use the orbs I am paid, and I upgrade to a new gun
Shoot and jump through an orange +Portal+ step out through a blue one
Now maybe I am dreaming, maybe I have gone insane
Or maybe, just maybe I've been playing too many games

[Chorus]

[samples: repeat 3X]
"Super Nintendo, Super Nintendo..." - Biggie
"Forever, forever, forever..." - Andre 3000

[samples]
"Super Nintendo, Super Nintendo"
"Forever, forever ever, FOREVER EVER?"

[Chorus]

[Random] This for the..
"T-minus 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4"
[Random] Yeah we goin to the moon
"3, 2, 1, ignition, liftoff"

[Random]
Super Mario trilogy, Billy Lee, Jimmy Lee
Castlevania, Contra, Jackal and Super C
Lode Runner, Kid Niki, Mega Man 1, 2, 3
4, you get the picture even Shadow of the Ninja
Section Z, Rygar, Gradius, Die Hard
Crystalis, Amagon, Superspike, Metal Gear
Metroid, Pro Am, Captain Skyhawk too
Maniac Mansion but I had to use the walkthrough
Bayou Billy, Spy Hunter, Shadowgate, Rush'n Attack
Skate or Die 2, Blaster Master kept me in the house
Battletoads, Duck Tales, Chip 'n Dale, Mickey Mouse
Bases Loaded, Pro Wrestling, Track &amp; Field I hit the hurdles
Legendary Wings but I gave up on Ninja Turtles
Nemo, Metal Storm, Lolo, Adventure Isle
Bionic Commando, Wizards and Warriors
Monsters in my Pocket, Kirby, Fester's Quest
Of course Final Fantasy, Balloon Fight, Earthbound
Tecmo Bowl; Okoye truckin cats for first downs
Double Dribble, River City Ransom, Kid Icarus
Still know the code to Mike Tyson it's ridiculous
Donkey Kong, Golgo 13, and Goonies 2
Guardian Legend, Friday the 13th, who coulda knew?
Some call it obsession but they can't understand
Creativity it gave me made me just what I am
With the Bible under my hand I swear
If I wasn't a gamer, I probably wouldn't have a career, yeah
And some of y'all ain't gon' get with this
But there's a million people that might feel different
The gamers {*echoes*}</pre>
