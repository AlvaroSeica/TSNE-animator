Song:   Follow Me
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

Just when you thought it was safe
I came back with the double D clan
waitin for da man Buckshot, 
Da BDI...general, if I was you I wouldnt try
so many tried so I seen the petty pass by
listen as I take you on a mission with precision
like a brown cent went on a hunt
worldwide searchin for the true ingredients 
to make the pi ?? 6
shorty wanna hound me for a flick
but I got my chips, you gettin visions of my lips
dicks swang, it dont mean a thang 
cuz when I was down, you was on the other side of town
getting done by Starang, when he was in range
now its gettin cold, so you actin kinda strange
puttin my time to you broke bitches
dont do shit but stress me out, now Im back in my riches
to get my blue print down to my very last dot
every move every motivation that I need
aint no hesitation when it comes to rockin when we speak
just follow my lead on this jou-rney

You never heard another MC like me
follow my lead on the jour-ney
you never heard another MC like me

Follow my lead on the journey
you never heard another Mc like me
so poetically on point its ridiculous
hittin every key bassline when Im rippin this
dont act like this aint the shit right now
you know my hits make you wanna dance
but you still sittin down
dumb fucks have a seat and keep your tongue in your throat
and dont bother to quote one note
or in the mirror you kickin the verse to mine
cuz in the freestyle, you'll be the last to rhyme
this aint the battle between the two best no more
survival of the fittest...this shit is war
if you got your eyes open, you can see the light
if you need a guide, follow wit pride...right

Chorus

So many people took my lyrics and hooks
if I wrote a book about you crook niggas gettin shook
in a hot second, Im a get the hot-steppin
on first, when Im on my verse, niggas need a nurse
witout the kill patient, aint no hesitation 
bring your weapon like your military mind 
and steppin on E, times over for you Mc's
all hail to G-O-D's, G-O-D's....

Chorus
