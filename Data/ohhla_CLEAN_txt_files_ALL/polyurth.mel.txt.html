[Intro]
Let's boogie, ha!
Hip-Hop whassup? So...

[Hodgy Beats]
Me and my crew decide to hit up a party
When we got to the joint it had already started
I had some food with me from Boston Market
Save for after mary jane because I already sparked it
Then we parked the car as I opened the door
Some honies in the driveway, passed out on the floor
It's a mixed race crowd, everybody's segregatin
We can't dance cause all these people steady hatin
I'ma groove cause I'm smooth, I be doing my thing
but I hate being around when, niggaz wanna bang
Then the fight break out, and it's one of them gangs
Acting like they manufactured, identical, the same
Niggaz can't fight and revert to the flame
Blew his brains out from not usin his brain
It's so insane how we put ourselves to shame
If the government could, they'd have all us niggaz detained

[Chorus: Left Brain]
Life is but a dream and I'm high
These haters on a lower level nigga I'm high
These hoes be tryin to roll but baby I'm high
These niggas tryin to smoke it but I'm already high

[Bridge: MellowHype]
Is you high? (Now roll it up)
Cause I'm high (I light it up)
And he high (I take a puff)
And she shy (let's snort a sniff)
And we high (I shoot it up)
And we high (let's take a sip)
And we high (cause we high)
And we high {wait, what happened next?}

[Hodgy Beats]
He got a ninety-six Volvo it's the year of ninety-six
Slangin out his trunk, he had about ninety kicks
Bought a MPC which had about ninety kicks
Flipped the drug money for studio, composed ninety hits
He wanted it all, he's an almighty kid
Got a girl, chasin girls, such a greedy grimey kid
Stole from his family, rockin all the hand-me's
Always got his hand out, can't somebody hand me
my childhood back cause I'm runnin on the line
And the line's runnin flat, but my rhyme's sounding fat
So I'll survive off that, born and raised in the trap
It's a wrap when I rap so it's a wrap
Piggie in the blanket, house arrest flow
like the brace around my anklet, fundraiser spirit
Welcome to my fuckin banquet, it costs to be a boss
So don't think I don't pay shit, if it's Odd it don't make sense
I'm in the +Middle+ of the money like +Malcolm+
Because I work hard, workin hard is how come
I don't be focused on the outcome
cause I'm the bullets cocked and your child outgunned

[Chorus]
Go to high school going to college I'm high
Getting my education expectations so high
Head's in the clouds with Mellowhype rollin by
Burger in my bag with a large extra fry

[Outro]
Cause I'm high (roll it up)
And he high (we lit it up)
And we high (oh, we smoked it up)
And she shy (bitch, let's take a sniff)
But she bi (we took a stiff)
I'm a guy (wait, what the fuck?)
She like girls (oh shit)
So do I {there go the cops}</pre>
