Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I be so humble my regular state
All loving its never no hate
A whole another level of yates
How there isn't when the brain of a rebel create
A fellow with a peddle to break
I'm settled but this devil is awake
When its applied
Something from deep inside
No longer sneaks and hides
It awakens the beast and prized
Through ligaments bones and through eyes
No reminets known as true shyness
Real men thrown in to die
Given it moments to rise
Then a metamorphosis happens like a lit torch
When its rapping hyped and its warped
And its fashions to bring forth war
And its passion
Laughin' wickedly baby whats happenin'
Where smashing ass yes that humble guy is a has been
And no they can't
Come make me stay saint
When I get that on I black out it feels like I may faint
Then I feel invincible never come to kid or play prank
I say what the fuck I want and do what I want to do behind my

(Face Paint)
I can be who I want to be
And I know its still me
But I'm totally free with my
(Face Paint)
I put it on for you to see
What is hiding deep inside behind my
(Face Paint)
I can be who I want to be
And I know its still me
But I'm totally free with my
(Face Paint)
I put it on for you to see
What is hiding deep inside behind my
(Face Paint)

Brian Dennis painted my face back in
The day like 94 look now ain't it my taste
I know a lot of mother fuckers think he tainted my faith
But I keep that cross on me I pray and it just ain't at my grace
But I ain't perfect
Give me paint and the mic and Ima merc it
Kent Clark's within me, when I'm up he has no purpose
Techa Nina the king that will bring the circus to the surface
Shaken the planet earth is a curse if you never heard this
Technicians started me juggalos they spotted me
Allotted me there land to expand this cultural odyssey
I'm there wicked prodigy being strange is the policy
Anybody talking nill of my family can swallow me
Scenario the more paint the marry-o a burial for Kent
He's square his ho keep him very low
My appearance to week motherfuckers is scary tho
They cant even think of touching what I put through the stereo

Here's my analysis:
Since the beginning I have been saying that I'm a angel
But since I accepted the ways of the world;
Money, women, I became a worldly angel
But my mother always wanted me to do it for Christ
So I think the angel inside of me is ashamed
So in order to bring you all this rawness I have learned from earth
I hide behind

(Face Paint)
I can be who I want to be
And I know its still me
But I'm totally free with my
(Face Paint)
I put it on for you to see
What is hiding deep inside behind my
(Face Paint)
I can be who I want to be
And I know its still me
But I'm totally free with my
(Face Paint)
I put it on for you to see
What is hiding deep inside behind my
(Face Paint)

(Reversed)
Think again think again nigga
Huh, The angels been long gone
You full blooded Animal (ha,ha,ha)
That's whats inside of you
You just don't want to admit it
But you know you've become... Totally Animal
And the Face Paint brings it forth ha, ha, ha</pre>
