Let me get you high for the moment
fuck fire what I'm smoking imma need a dub on it
know that swisher's all we blowin
leave the paper for the toilet gotta tip and a molly and a bitch that keep it rollin uh!
know you smell me when I rollin uh!
me and miss mary jane yea we so in love
Its friday just call me smokey in this motha fuck-a over seas snuck a OZ over customs
watch you got on it? show me the dough nigga
were I'm from you dont drop you dont smoke wit us uh!
need too on the double, if you trynna match up like a puzzle holla at me

[Chorus]
No sticks no seeds we ain't stressin over here
No sticks no seeds we ain't stressin over here
No sticks no seeds we ain't stressin over here
And if it ain't OG I ain't even trynna hit wuh!
No Sticks no seeds we ain't stressin over here

Okay I'm smoking on that good, we dont tell no regie
Bout to roll another one up, fat as miss piggy
said if you ain't got that OG then you ain't fuckin wit me

(cant really feel my face)
but I'm feeling myself, outta line outta space
burning like a fireplace, I got da fire in this place
you think I'm lying come and try me, leave you crying like mace!
I said I'm higher then a kite no strings attached
you ain't gotta put it out baby gon bring it back
smoke it down to the ground
you ain't gotta miss this all my niggas round me got trees like its christmas oh!
just tryna keep it settle
call me rocket ship shawty come and hop up on my shuttle uh!
I break it down in a rumble if you tryna match up like a puzzle holla at me baby

[Chorus]
No sticks no seeds we ain't stressin over here
No sticks no seeds we ain't stressin over here
No sticks no seeds we ain't stressin over here
And if it ain't OG I ain't even trynna hit wuh!
No Sticks no seeds we ain't stressin over here</pre>
