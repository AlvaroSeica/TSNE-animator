Oohh... 
Ohh Oooohh... 

[Verse One]
What a world that I'm livin' in
Will the rainstorms ever end
Still I fell my path narrow
I run again
Seems happiness is gone again
And then you see 'em
Grey clouds up above mane
Metaphoric to my life mane
Still I fell my 
Heart stronger then it's ever been
Strong will 'til my journey ends
Until then I roll
More then I've ever rolled 
Not pills but the mary though
Still I fell my 
Eyes heavy when the day goes
Nothing helping with my head dose
But I ain't sleep
Awake in another state
Livin' in a new space
Still I feel my 
Mind runnin' at a steady pace
God help me so I'll win the race

[Chorus]
Until then I go... 
The sky might fall
The sky might fall
But I'm not worried at all
C'mon C'mon
The sky might fall
The sky might fall
But I'm not worried at all
Hey Hey

[Bridge]
I let them know some
Let them know some, 
Let them know some
Nigga listen up, Listen up, listen up, listen up
Hey I let them know some
Let them know some
Let them know some
Nigga listen up, listen up, listen up, listen up

[Verse Two]
Grey clouds took together fam
Lightning piercing through another land
Over the desert where the lost play
Soul searching each and every way
An then you see the
Awesome sounds so profound
When it - It'll grip you
You can see it
If you hear you can feel it too
Somethin' special I am learnin' to
Until then I go
Away very far away
To another universe where all the people say
It's that new new place for the special to embrace
Like a martian who seemingly wandered out of place
Take what you need from the valley of the hopeful
Where even if you drown you'll be floatin' high 'em
You can say Bye Bye Bye
Sky might be fallin' but remember you can fly high

[Chorus]
The sky might fall
The sky might fall
But I'm not worried at all
C'mon C'mon
The sky might fall
The sky might fall
But I'm not worried at all
