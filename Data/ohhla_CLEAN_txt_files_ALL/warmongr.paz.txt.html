[Intro]
YEAH~! Hahahahahaha...
Yo Fame whattup muh'fucker?
Fizzy Womack on the beat, M.O.P.
+Firing Squad+ Official Pistol Gat
Yeah (yeah)

[Vinnie Paz]
My fist enters in your temple like an obelisk
It's blackness, darkness, abyss of joblessness
Everything you do is small, my shit is monstrous
I murder devils and any of they accomplices
My brain function on other levels of consciousness
My brain function on other levels of pompousness
You're listenin to the bass and treble of Godlessness
My thirty-eight'll spit hate and level the populous
My esophogus breed the evil that just demolishes
Whether or not you're a believer in the Apocalypse
Y'all shit is sweeter than two faggots that's lockin lips
It ain't a rapper competin with my obnoxiousness
It ain't nobody that's equal to my accomplishments
The Desert Eagle is legal and it astonishes
The AR-15 diesel and blow your mom to bits
It's hard to catch me I'm Thurman Munson and Carlton Fisk

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Music is motivation for me to just go insane
When - I see it on paper, I know that I should be caged
Then - I'm trapped but I escaped it (ESCAPED IT~!)
By trappin in that trap for that paper

[Vinnie Paz]
Y'all know the flow is precise, you don't owe me your life
But that could change, one roll of the dice
And then money try to go for his knife
I'ma levitate his body to the sky until he homies with Christ
Don't even fuck around, son is a goon
Son is bi-polar, alcoholic, son is consumed
I breathe life into the sun and the moon
I breathe life into the most barren bloodiest womb
Y'all don't know y'all gettin stalked in the shower
Populism is rebellion over corporate power
Politics is just the talk of the hour
It's a matter of time before they hit another office or Tower
I don't care, I'll put the gun to your ribs
And the Desert E big, it'll separate mothers from kids
I walked around from Philly slums to the Vridge
Been around the world eighty times, nobody can fuck with the kid
YEAH {*echoes*} {*laughter*}

[Chorus]

[Outro]
BRRAP~! {*laughter*}
BRRAP BRRAP BRRAP!
Official Pistol Gat
Faggot rapper, I'm not you rapper
I'm a G (I'm a G)
Hahahahahaha... {*echoes*}
FIRING SQUAD!!!</pre>
