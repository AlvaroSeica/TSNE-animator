Typed by: Chaz Kangas

Tis the season for certain types
of inner-city dwellers and suburbanites
to observe the nights of the birth of Christ
work the lights and buy merchandise
and when the Bourbon strikes and the fire is blazin'
those of us of the Christmas persuasion
eat gingerbread like Hansel and Gretel
and settle as we revel in some Christmas specials
Ladies tolerate me - I'm wearing O'Shea
I'm looking taller lately, I'm Keyser SÃ¶ze
Christmas is the time of year that we watch Christmas shows
so as soon as your family leaves take off your Christmas clothes and

Have Christmas with me now
Have Christmas with me now
Have Christmas with me now
I'm watchin' TV
Have Christmas with me now
Have Christmas with me now
Have Christmas with me now
cool as a stocking stuffer

Pee-Wee's having a party at the Playhouse
but what will Topanga lay out?
Hit the dog track, bet on Santa's Little Helper
"Ebenezer Screw" - Beavis working at the shelter
Uncle Jesse locked in the toy store attic
Sing-a-long Mr. Hankey's Christmas classics
Bing Crosby and David Bowie
Holy Holy, act like you now

Commercial break

Santa's life I'm livin' it
show me a tree I'm trimmin'
bought a gift and I'm givin' it
but first I gotta ribbon it
paper I gotta glitter it
little more than a little bit
pretty so when they rippin' it
they most likel won't litter it
tag who will deliver it
To/From in a limerick
quick so when I'm spittin' it
little kids are illiterate
cold, so when I'm still in it
they M&amp;M and Skittles
quivering just a little bit
like "Damn, Chaz, you killin' it"
I'm drillin' in a Christmas special, yall could never hate it
Stop-motion animation, Gonzo narrate it
putting up a tree, now we gotta decorate it
this song is an ornament, you can commemorate it
I'm Mr. Chaz Kangas, I'm Mr. Rap
get a get-right pass at midnight mass
so that holly-jolly ass gets tapped and...

Have Christmas with me now
Have Christmas with me now
Have Christmas with me now
I'm watchin' TV
Have Christmas with me now
Have Christmas with me now
Have Christmas with me now
cool as a stocking stuffer

We're. Here. To
Bring the people all the music and deliver all the presents now
They. See. Through
Repetitive etiquette when it isn't holly-jolly now
This. Is a necessary change, from the old simple and plain
here to exercise that brain and break the chain and break your candy canes</pre>
