[Verse 1 - Missy]
You see me goin in a circle, I say wine ya body
I say me ruff neck boys look ruff and ready
I got pressure from my peers so I gotta have a beer
And I set you on fire, like my nigga Richard Pryor
Splifs are for higher, Mama Dory sourer
I sport my Sista power, give me an hour to be down with Jodice
Meet me on the 125th, get a left on my hydraulic drop top
I got my 47 Chevy, I is heavy like Heavy D
And your Mr. Big Suff, yeah I like a ruff thump thump
Me and the back stroke, then its time go
Then its time to meet my Sistas Clan on 125th street
Dang, dang

Sista's rollin up on the 125th
dida-di-dang-dang -dida-di-dang-dang- dida-di-dang-dang, uh
Sista's rollin up on the 125th
dida-di-dang-dang -dida-di-dang-dang- dida-di-dang-dang, uh
Sista's rollin up on the 125th
dida-di-dang-dang -dida-di-dang-dang- dida-di-dang-dang, uh
Sista's rollin up on the 125th street</pre>
