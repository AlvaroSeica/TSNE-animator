Album:  Till the Wheels Fall Off
Song:   In the Back of My Low Low
Typed by: Wammy Giveaway

Chorus: Fingazz
Just wait
Til I get you in the back of my low low
We can bounce
We can smoke
We can switch it to slow mo
Move it front, to back
And side to side
Up and down, all around the world
Are you ready, girl

[Verse 1: Frost]
Park the Impala, hit the strip
Walk in the club with a gangsta limb
Hit V.I.P., you know how we do it
Fine little mami, I'm about to pursue it
High off the kush and twisted on fluid
Can we talk, girl, I see how you do it
Have you ever did it in the back of the car
With a Chicano rap star
Do you like it, fast or slow
I could pull on your hair, girl, let me know
And I hit so deep
So deep (So deep)
Put that ass to sleep

Repeat Chorus

Hook: Frost
Let's bounce like a six-four
Come on, bounce like a six-four
Hop on the down like a six-four
Girl, bounce like a six-four

[Verse 2: Big Capone]
I see you on the corner there, standin' so thick
With them pretty brown eyes, can't wait to grit
What you think
I'm a buy you a quick drink
But I don't even know if you gonna go down low
I'm a hit it in the back, on my blue six-four
Parked in the alley and keepin' it Low Pro
Heard what you said, now enough with the talk
Got a hundred percent on the smoke
So let's park
You know I'm a have to have it my way, right
Legs spread, keep it tight, while you moan all night
So just let it go, let it go when the low-low
Low, feel it grow, feel it grow, nah, I'm gettin' in

Repeat Chorus

Repeat Hook

[Verse 3: Frost]
Now let me see what you workin' with
Bend all over, let me touch that {*imitates sizzle*}
Oooh, you a nasty girl
Twerk that thang, go around the world
Uh
You a nasty freak
I can hear it in the voice and the way you speak
You want me to come over and get real deep
I'll put your kitty cat to sleep
Then I'll jump in the low low and hit the street
With another little mama in the passage seat

Repeat Chorus

Repeat Hook</pre>
