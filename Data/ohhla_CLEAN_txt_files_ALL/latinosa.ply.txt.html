[Skillz]
Play-N-Skillz (Play-N-Skillz...)
Latino (Latino...)
Put your L's (Put your L's...)
Up in the sky (Up in the sky...)

[Play-N-Skillz &amp; Big Gemini]
LATINOS STAND UP!
It's going down tonight
So if you down to ride
Let's get it crackin', if you Latin, put ya L' up high
You in the club (Yeah)
And you ain't scared (Yeah)
Well, let me see ya put ya L's in the air

[Verse 1: Skillz {Skillz *slowed down*}]
You wanna talk what I talk, cause I walk the walk
I don't have to rap, I let the beat talk
This is my people, mayne, I gotta represent it, mayne
Latinos stand up
Got a Freak
That's what they call me
Back Then, they was all on me
{Now I'm hot, they still on me}
From the BX, to the TX
They don't wanna plex
We pullin' up techs
You can pour it up
You can smoke it up
If you Latino, then throw it up
Now put them L's up in the sky
If you really down to ride
East side, west side
North side, south side
From the H-Town, to the D-Town
Alberquerque and San Anton'
Southern Cali
Northern Cali
NYC, you know it's on
L.A.
To the M.I.A.
East coast, west coast, down south
MTV
BET
Now this is what we talkin' 'bout

Chorus: Play-N-Skillz &amp; Big Gemini
Your hood (PUT THEM UP, PUT THEM UP!)
Your sex (PUT THEM UP, PUT THEM UP!)
Your clique (PUT THEM UP, PUT THEM UP!)
Your drink (PUT THEM UP, PUT THEM UP!)
You in the club (Yeah)
And you ain't scared (Yeah)
Well, let me see ya put ya L's in the air
It's going down tonight
So if you down to ride
Let's get it crackin', if you Latin, put ya L' up high
You see us in the hood
Let's get it understood
Our people with us, wanna try us, man I wish you would (LATINOS STAND UP!)

Hook: Play-N-Skillz &amp; Big Gemini
Boricua, Mexicano
LATINOS STAND UP!
Colombiano, Cubano
LATINOS STAND UP!
Dominicanos, Latin people
YEAH, STAND UP!
Well, let me see ya put ya L's in the air

[Verse 2: Play]
L, A, T, I
N-O-S, y'all better recognize
Got no choice, but to keep it real fly
It's about time we was on the rise
Fuck to rap, y'all can have it back
Cause the beat's to bump in the Cadillac
And it really don't matter if you white or black
This ain't about the race, just statin' facts
Peep on the streets, we don't ever panic
So people don't like when we talk in Spanish
Talk me mad, cause you can't understand it
Gotta say nothin' but to make you vanish
Wanna hate
I want a hater say it
But we been runnin' down, so they had to play it
You should be glad, not mad, we made it
Might be sad, but we can't be faded

Repeat Chorus &amp; Hook

(Verse 3)
[Skillz]
It seems like the world wanna know what's up
LATINOS STAND UP!
I'm down with Crips and Bloods
I'm down with black thugs
But I'm Latino when them doctors go to pump some blood
This ain't no Ricky Martin, here, watch
What ya say
Cause we sell the records, gettin' paid with no (Video play)
It's them boys, Skillz and Play
Make a hundred beats a day
I'm Latino, brown and proud
If you with me, say it loud
Five minutes for this beat
Had to do it, for the streets

[Play]
All I need's
Four bars, to let you know, my people been ready to blow
It was destined for Latins to go
Platinum in rappin', you know
It can be done, the one
To do it was Pun and won
Latinos been always the one
To prove 'em wrong, and now, it's on

Repeat Chorus &amp; Hook</pre>
