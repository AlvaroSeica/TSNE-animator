Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Grand hustle in the buildin
We goin to the club tonite
Like we do every nite
It's always somewhere to go in atlanta shawty

[Chorus]
I don't kno
Wat I wanna do

Go to the mall
Freshen up
Gator up
I'm a go to the club
Go to the club
I'm a go to the club
I'm a go to the club

[Verse 1: Young Dro]
Dead fresh

Shawty I don't give a dam
Sunny outside but
My jewelery got me cool
Feel real good
So I'm trippin like a fool
Diamonds on my neck
So you kno a nigga frozed up
I'm fresh
I'm clean
Up in this club

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Young Dro]
I'm bout to be the shit
Chevy pain same color margarita mix
J.b on the track
So it gotta be a hit
Polo to the racks
So it gotta be a fit
20 in the mall
Man it gotta be a brick
Hollygram homes
Man I gotta be rich
Ice so cold
Man I gotta be sick
Pockets on hammers
Man I gotta be legit
I'm laughin
Ridin around in my aston
My chich look like toni braxton
I flow beyond day
Like dro puerto rico
I like beyonce
Range rover quante
I fuks with ya'll
See me in the club
Say wats up big dog
My truck sit tall
Lambo sit low
Tha sun outside
I'm polo to the flow
Young dro

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Young Dro]
I'm coolin
I'm stupid fruity
High feets on juicey coupins
High leanin back
On dusey fuseys
Dro bankhead is scoopin pusey
Sat my car on stupid ruseys
30's so tall
I'm hoola hoopin
She kno young dro car duki duki
30 grand in the mall
I went bookie bookie
A-town potna
Pockets on gwalla
Black boy white boy
Rock game potna
I'm finna have fun
I'm lookin at the sun
To fresh shawty
Man you lookin at a don
I see you lookin at a nigga
Wats up
I see you lookin at a nigga
Wats up
I see you lookin at a nigga
Wats up
I see you lookin at a nigga
Wats up
Up in the club

[Chorus]</pre>
