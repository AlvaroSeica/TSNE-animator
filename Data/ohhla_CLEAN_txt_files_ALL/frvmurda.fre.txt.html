[Intro: ShaCronz (Free Murda)]
Man, fuck is going? (What?)
Shit is crazy, yo Free (Yo, what's up son?)
Ain't shit, what's good, man (ain't shit chilling)
Yo, this muthafucka on the other side running around
Spazzing on the workers and shit, son (word?)
Telling niggas they can't bubble on this side
Trying to get on some real Deebo shit, yoknowhatimean (what's that coming from?)
Ain't going down like that, knowhatimsayin
My nigga gave me his math, though (word?)
He talking about he wanna holla, he a wild nigga man, yo holla at this nigga, son
(I'mma holla at him, I'mm holla at that nigga...)

[Free Murda]
Yo, who the fuck is it? (You know who this is?)
Yo, who the fuck is this? (Not one of your chicks, I want to get one thing clear)
Hold on, you think it's some lames here? (Simply and plain? Yeah)
What? (Nigga I ain't talking bout your hands and them
Plus you all hype for nothing) I take you off the planet, son!
(We'll see when them cannons come) I don't wanna hear nothing
(Aight, I'll have you stiff like a mannequin)
Free, don't make me break your skinny ass up
Ooh, on my mother.. (You trying give me bad luck?
And I thought you didn't know who this was) What I thought
(Nah you ain't think nothing, running your lips, brah
But anyway, we can get it on, nigga, anyday)
Now you know you gone, word is bond, I let the semi spray
(Yeah, that's just hearsay, you getting alotta airplay)
What, on his jack? (Nah, this went there, man)

[Interlude: Free Murda (ShaCronz)]
Yo, (yo, son) Son you hear this nigga Murda?
(Yeah man, this nigga wilding the fuck out) Fucking bugging and shit
This nigga ain't tryin', he ain't trying work, shit, son
(Ain't trying to get nothing, nigga, word
Spaz, word, we can spaz too out, give him a hundred percent
Yup, word up...)

[Free Murda]
Yo partner, let me make this brief
Stop telling my soldiers in your street to stop selling for me
(You don't see them cops on the Beac', they making my share hot
About to get to banging) My shit copped
But let's keep this on the busines low (Nigga, I ain't getting down)
You don't wanna do business, yo? (I ain't tryin' to get with you clowns)
That's what you think we are? (Not in that way
Ya'll rocking platinum and cars) Not around your way
I got the clientele, I just want some of that real estate
(Now you bugging, we ain't eating off the same dinner plate)
Aight, it'll be a wait, and I'm gon' beat the case
(Aight, nigga, lead the way) I think you gon' need your cake

[Interlude: ShaCronz (Free Murda)]
Fuck this nigga is bugging out, son (yo)
(This nigga fucking bugging, I think I got his ass though, son)
Yeah, you get him right? Shook (I'm gon' give that nigga a ring up
And see if he shook up, if he ain't shook up in about a minute, I'm going over there, son)
Aight, I got some ki's over there, son (I want some of that, son)

[Free Murda]
Yeah, tell me something (I think we can work something out)
What's that shit you talking, don't make me murk nothing out
(I think we should do this 50/50) Nah, you must be off that sticky-icky
You see what happened to Pretty Ricky (Yeah that shit was fucked up)
I was thinking 70/30 (damn, that shit fucked up)
I need some time to weigh my options) I ain't try'nna stay here and gossip
So talk and don't try to change the topic (yo, ya'll niggas bleed just like us)
Well I'm a fix it where you don't breathe just like us
So you better talk quick, cuz you fucking my minutes up
And all my niggas known, for shooting lieutenants up
(Whatever Free, we been through the same shit) What you saying?
(I ain't tryin' to say shit) I see you round the way, bitch...</pre>
