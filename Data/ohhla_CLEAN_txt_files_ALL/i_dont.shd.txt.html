I put the smack down like its rehab
Make sure that there's no relapse with these cats
Cowards couldn't rap this dope with a zig zag
I let my lips drag, spitting with that big swag
Its sad all these wannabes
Wanted to be Jay then K. West
Wanna be star of the Roc(Rock)
Kid you're not Sean Connery
But like The Rock I'm surrounded by watery flows
Still it really don't bother me
Fake ballers, weak game, less polished than Bell Wallace's
While I breed quality music getting quality spins
They stay 2nd rate Chingy's at the Quality Inn
Now that's a joke to a real rapper
I could decrease the skill factor and still make you feel whacker
Ah gee, now you got me - cocky
Cats say 'you the illest' I'm like 'nah b nah b nah b...'
Well ok probably but that's just only cuz I rap like its my hobby
Not a jobby-job all sloppy and off-key
Y'all Mad as March trying to knock off the top-seed
I'm in the mix/Da Mix  like Roxy
So hot he even get props from neo-Nazis
Now I don't really like to...

v-2
I Tunes, eye-patch
I'm in the same boat where the pirates be
Tell'em I'm down with that pirate stee
They don't buy it, I say don't buy it - pirate me
If its ill, it'll spread virally
From my received folders to 
Appearin in the love that the crowds show
(shhh) if it sound dope - keep it on the downlo(ad)
Keep it real, player/Real Player
With the volume cranked
And I'll be ballin like Tim Duncan - callin bank
Cash - banked it
But the bank said
That my cheque's been bouncing like the bankhead
So I'm bad like credit while they bear styles
More plain/plane than the air miles
Borrowed metaphors from mega-stores to get rewards
We get'em open automatic like the exit doors
And take a step higher - y'all just gotta press the floor
And step out - in faith - its ok to confess doubt
Knowin how it feels to be stressed out
Tribe called map quest-style poems I sketch out
To find the best route home
Don't live in your dome for too long
You end up like that Tiffany song - thinking we're alone
We all get older, we don't all get grown
Cuz some of Y'ALL don't really like to...</pre>
