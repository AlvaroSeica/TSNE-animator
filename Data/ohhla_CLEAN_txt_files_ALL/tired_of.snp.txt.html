[Intro: Akon]
KONVICT!

[Verse One: Snoop Lion] (Akon)
I'm sittin on my porch watchin the law
As they ride past in they patrol cars
So tell me why I feel like the enemy
They suppose to be here protectin me
I might have went too far
Helpin to contribute it makin their job hard
Servin fiends like these people ain't no kin to me
I can't believe I'm out here killin my community
If you know how far I came (Far I came)
Where I am and where I use to be (Where I use to be)
I don't want it you can tell by the look at me (Tell by the look at me)
This gangsta ain't no longer in me

[Chorus: Snoop Lion &amp; Akon] (Akon)
Yeah I'm tired of the runnin, tired of the runnin, tired of the runnin
Runnin from the law (Runnin from the law)
Baby you gotta believe it
Said I'm tired of the runnin, tired of the runnin, tired of the runnin
Runnin from the law (Runnin from the law)
Baby you gotta believe it

[Verse Two: Snoop Lion] (Akon)
I know there's things I could've change girl
I know there's things I could've done alot better
Instead I'm in the streets tryin to make that cheddar
Thinkin in my mind that you 'gon be there forever
I know I could've let it all go (Let it all go)
But I was thinkin it would make life better (Make life better)
Instead I'm sittin in the cell writin this letter (Writin this letter)
Thought I wasn't gettin caught 'cause I was way too clever
Although there's no one to catch you when your fallin
And there be no one to hear you when your callin
Do you know what it's like to wake up in the mornin? (In the mornin)
Whule your starvin your hearin bugs crawlin (Bugs crawlin)
Reminiscin on the day you was walkin
With pretty women on your arm while your flossin
Thanks for that I didn't end up in the coffin
Somethin we see too often

[Chorus: Snoop Lion &amp; Akon] (Akon)
Yeah I'm tired of the runnin, tired of the runnin, tired of the runnin
Runnin from the law (Runnin from the law)
Baby you gotta believe it
Said I'm tired of the runnin, tired of the runnin, tired of the runnin
Runnin from the law (Runnin from the law)
Baby you gotta believe it

[Bridge: Akon]
Said I'm tired

[Snoop Lion]:
Said I'm tired, said I'm tired, so tired
Yeah!!!!

[Chorus: Snoop Lion &amp; Akon] (Akon)
Yeah I'm tired of the runnin, tired of the runnin, tired of the runnin
Runnin from the law (Runnin from the law)
Baby you gotta believe it
Said I'm tired of the runnin, tired of the runnin, tired of the runnin
Runnin from the law (Runnin from the law)
Baby you gotta believe it

[Outro: Akon]
Said I'm tired</pre>
