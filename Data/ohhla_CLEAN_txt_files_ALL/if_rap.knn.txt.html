Song:   If Rap Gets Jealous
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Yeaaa, uh, let me introduce me
I don't gotta pack due to the fact I'm Africa's Rap Bruce Lee
Plus they've been trying to shoot me since I was two feet
So I am never scared, you can Youtube me
Where I'm from they will pull your card Mister, you ain't hard mister
I was initiated into manhood at thirteen and it wasn't a barmitzvah
I break a bottle on ya like a bad bartender
Let my star venture out, I got war in me, so let me vent it out

I don't expect you to feel my pain, but with respects to the rules of the game
They don't apply because I made it this far, stage dive like a ghetto rockstar

[Chorus]
And if rap gets jealous cause I rock heavy, it don't worry me if mothafuckers don't get it
So if rap gets jealous, cause of where i'm headed, I used to be a public enemy, don't forget it
And if rap gets jealous cause I rock heavy, it don't worry me if mothafuckers don't get it
So if rap gets jealous, baby I'm a menace, you know, I came to bring the pain

I'll admit it I could spit it like a fitted knitted cap
That means tight and won't stop like a city cab
That means I'm not white but I figured do it big because the slum needs me
So instead of getting a beat from Kanye(eezy) who would probably take half my budget
I could save the back end and send it back to Mogadishu
where my family and friends getting patched up again you can ask Hova
The hood is harder than you thought like a fifty chain getting snatched in Angola

I don't expect you to feel my pain
but with respects to the rules of the game
They don't apply because I made it this far
stage dive like a ghetto rockstar

[Chorus]
And if rap gets jealous cause I rock heavy, it don't worry me if mothafuckers don't get it
So if rap gets jealous, cause of where i'm headed, I used to be a public enemy, don't forget it
And if rap gets jealous cause I rock heavy, it don't worry me if motherfuckers don't get it
So if rap gets jealous, baby I'm a menace you know I came to bring the pain

(You know) [x4]
[guitar solo]

So don't tell me I gotta be the same
I'm tryin to get you to know my name
And with respects to the rules of the game
they don't apply because I came this far, stage dive like a rockstar

And if rap gets jealous cause I rock heavy, it don't worry me if motherfuckers don't get it
So if rap gets jealous, cause of where I'm headed, I used to be a public enemy, don't forget it
And if rap gets jealous cause I rock heavy, it don't worry me if motherfuckers don't get it
So if rap gets jealous, baby I'm a menace, you know

Here we go
And if rap gets jealous
So if rap gets jealous baby I'm a menace, you know
I came to bring the pain</pre>
