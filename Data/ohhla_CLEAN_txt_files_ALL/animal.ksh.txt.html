[Ke$ha]
I am in love
with what we are
Not what we should, be, and I am
I am starstruck
with every part
of this whole story
So if it's just tonight
The animal inside
Let it live and die!!
Like it's the end of time
Like everything inside
Let it live and die!! And

[Chorus]
This is our last, chance; give me your, hands
Cause our world is spinning at the speed of light
The night is fa-ding, heart is ra-cing
Now just, come and love me like we're gonna die

[Ke$ha]
I'm not asleep
I'm up for the fight
Into the magic
And I don't, want the concrete
I am alive
Comes with the tragic
So if it's just tonight
The animal inside
Let it live and die!!

[Chorus]

[Ke$ha] And
