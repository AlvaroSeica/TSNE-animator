[Intro: Crisis]
Black Knights, through the jungles, we swarming
From every angle, stay swarming

[Crisis]
Yo, raised in environments where gats stay firing, pure violence
Ride for a salary, or sell drugs, thugs mentality
Poverty's reality, for and me, that's why we live the life of crime
Stuck in these medieval times, struggling
We murder for the love of hustling, my life
We keep the spot bubbling, til the narc's come rushing in
No other way, ball or fall, everything or nothing at all
Manifest thoughts, I speak and that's law
It's a thin line, between good and evil, light and darkest
Good hearted and heartless, I pull through regardless
To whom or what, refuse to lose, give your troops the blues
On this cell, shortstopping, Crisis known to keep the north popping
Cars driving, when the beats real, that's why we keep still
Tuck low, quick to let guns blow, so duck low
When you hear something you die, you come through here fronting
Black Knights, deliver act rights, we fear nothing

[Chorus: Crisis]
It's do or die in these streets, so what you choose
Show and prove if you know it's beef, nothing to lose
But your life, step into the Knights, so get it right
Don't grab a mic, if your shit ain't tight, get it right

[Holocaust]
Elephant men, guns and dirty mops
Purist hip hop, shots heard on your block
Run down the staircase, stepping on greedy roaches
Never can approach this, lyrics that be the dopest
Drinking screwdrivers, laughing with the Skarekrow
Nails in a bucket of paint, the dirty saint
Ladies feel faint, I'm rusty as a monkey wrench
Thrown in the pipe works, swinging a Black Knight shirt
Late in the evening, nightmare, the poet
The sky rains hammers, who-who-who-who-who
Guns in your face, watch me act the silliest
On points bulletin, Killa Bee Gang affiliates
Club fight where you should mambo, cigars
Clean classy cars, evening at the opera house
This one ends with me, returning to the swamp
Kiss L.A. on the cheek, lost feed on you
I'd rather leap with umbrellas, fellas in congress
Are jealous, and lies is what they sell us
Fiddle happily, harmonica never triffle
Pistol on my lap, and in my coat was his riffle
Chitty bang bang, la-fi, Holocaust

[Chorus 2X]

[Crisis]
It's official, bloody paragraphs, contaminate your system
Perscribe the antidote, snipe that ass from a distance
Baptize my throat, with the Henny and coke
Firewater mixed with widow, hold it in til I choke
Get the full effect, eyes bloodshot, get drunk and pull a tech
Disconnect the neck of diamondbacks who disrespect
Leave you posing for obituaries, posted in cemetaries
Trapped in a box, for trying to slapbox with glocks
Hit your spot, released in multiple shots, strays ricochet
The walls in hallways, gunplay, all day
Got the block, locked like raw way
Fuck individuals, we make 'em all pay, all pay

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
