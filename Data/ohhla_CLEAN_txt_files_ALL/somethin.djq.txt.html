[DJ Quik]
This one goes out to my niggas
Cus we be havin to deal with these punk ass bitches
Check this out

Hey bitch you remember me
It's mista DJ Quik from the Westside of the Tree
And you met me at 2000 where I'm brownin
That's where me and the PPC were just clownin
Doin what we had to do to get by
No money in my pocket but I was still fly
Curled to my neck but I got respect
And now I stack fat sacks and ride around in a Lex
And oh my bitch how you changed
I see you rubbin all on my dick and it's feelin kinda strange
Cus then you wouldn't even walk me around the block
But now your tryin to throw me that toe up cock
I wouldn't touch you with a ten-foot pole
I gots to keep the P in it baby, muthafuck you hoes
But open up wide if you given up head
Because, close mouths don't get fed
I'm talking to punk ass, trick ass, nuttin ass bitches
What's the name of your perfume Vicious?
Hoes aint shit, aint gon' be, aint never will be
And I'ma make you feel bad that you fucked me
So fast-forward tricks this is strictly for my dogs
Ballin like a muthafucka ragtop hogs
And El Cos keep rollin to this gangsta shit
And when I'm feelin like being bothered with you bitches
I'm givin ya.. 

[Chorus]
Somethin 4 tha mood
Somethin to get you in the groove
So sip that cognac at get back
Cus that's just what I'm doin
What about my bitch on my lap?
(I'm givin ya.. )
Somethin 4 tha mood
Somethin to get you in the groove
So sip that cognac at get back
Cus that's just what I'm doin (ya know)
What about my bitch on my lap?

[DJ Quik]
Ah.. 
Now it's 5:15 and I'm thinking about niggas Playa Hamm
Mr. Shabby Bleu and Big Jam
Hamm's at Gina's so I hit him on my mobile
87 Sprint him so you know I gots to flow
Yo what's up nigga

[Playa Hamm]
Yo same ol' playa
Got some tendas, meet me over at Gina's a little later
Hook it up mobbin through with D and a couple of half G's
So is you down for the skeaze?

[DJ Quik]
I'm on my way
Now the bitches at Gina's they all wanna see me
Put my telephone down for the LAPD
They passed me, I pass them, and they didn't even trip
Now I'm doin 55 over the Arlington Dip
In my Lex-o rollin got me feelin superior
With the funky white pearl and black leather interior
My niggas in my truck, we aint givin a fuck
We carried a very face pace to 42nd place
Snoop Dogg blew it and headed back to the strip
In the left hand turnin lane niggas steppin on trick
Bust a right on Normande, the bitches blow for me
But I don't pay em no mind cus they come second to my homies
Hit the spot and bail but I don't step in the mud
Walk up in the living room where it's smellin like bud
In the kitchen where it aint no drinks but a gang a food
Ahh, let me pop the trunk cus I bought a little.. 

[Chorus]
Somethin 4 tha mood (Yeah)
Somethin to get you in the groove
So sip that cognac at get back
Cus that's just what I'm doin
What about my bitch on my lap?
(I'm givin ya.. )
Somethin 4 tha mood (Ya know)
Somethin to get you in the groove
So sip that cognac at get back
Cus that's just what I'm doin
What about my bitch on my lap?

[DJ Quik]
Now I dips to the studio to listen to the hits
2nd II None workin on some brand new shit
And it's tighter that a muthafucka got that swang
While Big J try to take a nigga straight to Beighjing
But I pass on the bud, I mash on the brew
Genuine Draft for my muthafuckin crew
Tashe's chillin, China just trippin
Chris engineering and Bacon and George sippin
So listenin to this track makes you understand
Why niggas still can't fuck with the one-man band
Got my dark lokes clean with the P on my crown
And my black leather trench to the muthafuckin grown
And I'm faded, knowin I don't wanna drive drunk
In case I get jacked got my shit in the trunk
Now I might have been swerving but I made it to the tent
Just another day in the life of Quik
I'm givin ya.. 

[Chorus]
Somethin 4 tha mood
Somethin to get you in the groove
So sip that cognac at get back
Cus that's just what I'm doin
What about my bitch on my lap?
(I'm givin ya.. )
Somethin 4 tha mood
Somethin to get you in the groove
So sip that cognac at get back
Cus that's just what I'm doin
What about my bitch on my lap?
(And you know I got)
Somethin 4 tha mood
Somethin to get you in the groove
So sip that cognac at get back
Cus that's just what I'm doin
What about my bitch on my lap?
(I'm givin ya.. )
Somethin 4 tha mood (Ya know baby)
Somethin to get you in the groove
So sip that cognac at get back
Cus that's just what I'm doin
What about my bitch on my lap? (And we up out)
