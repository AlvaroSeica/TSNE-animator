No! No! No!
No! No! No!

[Andy Cooper]
Wake up, I've got a real situation
So we need to move, time's wasting
I could lose everything that I have
And I'm not sure what I should do, it looks bad
Can anybody shed some light? (Please!)
How do I transform death to life?
Is there a way that I pay the cost?
or do I just fold and take the loss?

[Dizzy Dustin]
Listen to yourself you sound so dramatic
Bro, I think you're coming at it all wrong
Start fresh, you don't have to feel stressed
The trouble's all gone, it's a brand new dawn

[Chorus: Andy Cooper]
Wake up, that's yesterday
Turn the page, this story's ended
Move on, it's over now
Throw the towel in just forget it
No more, that's enough
Give it up, you look pathetic
Go now, dig the grave
Walk away but
I won't let it die, I won't let it die
I won't let it die (No! No! No!) 
I won't let it die (No! No! No!)
At least I have to try, try, try
At least I have to try, try, try
At least I have to try

[Andy Cooper]
How could I miss the signs
or did I find out and it slipped my mind?
Truth is, I really didn't wanna know
Cause if I knew, I'd have to be responsible
Served my just desserts
And justice hurts the judge the worst
I guess I've got to come down from the pedestal
and try to find something incredible

[Dizzy Dustin]
Please stop dreaming, looking for a reason
Believing like that is hazardous
It's spilled milk (What?), you don't have to feel guilt
You're not gonna bring back Lazarus

[Chorus: Andy Cooper]
So wake up, that's yesterday
Turn the page, this story's ended
Move on, it's over now
Throw the towel in just forget it
No more, that's enough
Give it up, you look pathetic
Go now, dig the grave
Walk away but
I won't let it die, I won't let it die
I won't let it die (No! No! No!) 
I won't let it die (No! No! No!)
At least I have to try, try, try
At least I have to try, try, try
At least I have to try

[Andy Cooper]
(Let's go)
Your faith is slipping through your fingers
Hopes and shorts apply
Fear and pain are closing in to take away your pride
You can't relax and rest in peace at least we have to try
I'm here to fight, despite the odds
So God help me cause I won't let it die
Whoo! I won't let it die
I won't let it die (No! No! No!) 
I won't let it die (No! No! No!)
At least I have to try, try, try
At least I have to try, try, try
At least I have to try, try, try
Won't let it go
Can't do it (Try, try, try
Can't do it, nope (Try, try, try)
Can't let it go, nope! (Try, try, try...)</pre>
