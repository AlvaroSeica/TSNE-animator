Werd S.O.S. the remix lets go
I think its time we hit them with the new flow

Hey babe you want to go some place
Right were the sun stays we should go one day
Maybe Sunday and go for sundae
And back to the flat we'r up to the Monday
I see you Tuesday but dont choose days
I see you when you want girl its choosdie
We get by and get high on the kush with
All our mates as we bake on the poofie
Yeah next days like Wednesday
But am not going to go through everyday
Nah I take her out so lovely
Out on the Friday and drink if she thirsty
On the Saturday we just sat that day
And thought about what we'd like to dae
Like get the mic like right away
Or get the pen and just write away

(She's my) She's my little thing
My little bit of everything
My raps on tracks and sling
This rapping thing not wrapping ching
Yeah but no tills go ching ching
No fame with the chain gone bling bling
Werd is not my name like the Ting-Tings
Not in the game like I've been sin binned

She's a hottie naughty she been bad
Talk about all the drugs that she did have
But with me she aint never been that
It wouldnt work see I would just bin that
Games foul we got to go hard
I protect you I be your shin guard
We can sail those seas like Sinbad
Get in a flight in the night if we win that
Just chin that catch the hook
I ken you like me I catched you look
So just come on dont fanny about
Lets tear up the stage like a raffle book
Yeah its nae hassle dude
Do you want to blow like the London tube
Healthy you would if you could
But I over stand get it understood

Rap Its what I'm on about mate


(Shes my) She's my little thing
My little bit of everything
My raps on tracks and sling
This rapping thing not wrapping ching
Yeah but no tills go ching ching
No fame with the chain gone bling bling
Werd is not my name like the Ting-Tings
Not in the game like I've been sin binned

Fae the dugout mate still fae the dugout
Standing on the white line
Aw what Wardies just sniffed it</pre>
