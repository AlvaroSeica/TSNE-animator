Typed by: Cno Evil

[Intro: Cno Evil (Li-Mouse)]
Yeah, fucking hot in here..
Oh, man, yo, you seen this movie?
Shit is hot, yo, there's a new movie
(Yo yo, keep this shit on, keep it on, keep it on)
Oh shit, ahh, shit, kill 'em, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo

[kung-fu sample]
Brother, why do they want to kill you?
I recognize them! Killers from court!
They broke their word
Get after them! Right!

[Chorus 2X: Cno Evil]
You made a mistake, cuz you fucked with, Cno and Mouse
And I think it's too late, for your fate
So shut your God damn mouth

[Cno Evil]
You think you're the hip hop Lord? That might change
You think you spit fire with words? That's light flames
You think you strike fast with the sword? That's a slight pain
You ask which part of the world, it's White Plains
So I might rearrange and adjust your frames
Cuz your brain can't contain all pain that I gave
I might stick the tag to your chest, you got your name
I make it rain... fuck Lil' Wayne
Drop seeds on your head, grow back like Rogaine
The flames is white, make you blow crack and cocaine
And like fame, nah, I stick to the locals
Spit sixteen bars in bars, I thought I told you
'Black Bears' pouncing on them 'Thirty Turtles'
While you 'Lounge' in a 'Lazy Boy' chair during commercials
Don't make me hurt you, my palms is mystical
I think 'I see you' and you look really critical

[Chorus 2X]

[Interlude: Li-Mouse (Cno Evil)]
Oh shit, son, this is the good part
Yo, yo, yo, yo, look it, look it
Yo, look at this part, son
It's crazy, you hear that sword swinging?
Yo, he's about to slice it, he's gonna
Oh wait, wait, oh shit, oh shit
(He cracked him with a boomerang!)
Hold on, hold on, hold on, oh shit
Oh shit

[kung-fu sample]
Brother, why do they want to kill you?
I recognize them! Killers from court!
They broke their word
Give it to 'em! Right!

[Chorus 2X: Li-Mouse]

[Li-Mouse]
Wind speed slashing, I'm dashing with the slow flow
And I spit local, from here to SoHo, you know?
Blow for blow, like we Vegas boxers
Lyrics got you stiff look like the trophy from the Oscars
Razor sharp blades, yeah, that's what I'm bringing
Ya'll just don't know, when my blades start swinging
You made a mistake, ain't you hear the fucking singing?
It's over like Culkin when the bees start stinging
I learned this deadly technique from the Witty Unpredictable
Only them, yes, them cats who bring the miracles
Forces of attack that crack powerful metals
While having soft flows like the wind and flower petals
Picture bloodbaths in elevator shafts, have you gasp
For air, I need oxygen, solution was to grasp
The microphone and to continue the strategy
And destroy MC's with such marvelous agony</pre>
