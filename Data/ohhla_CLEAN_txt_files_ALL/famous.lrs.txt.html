MC LARS &amp; K.FLAY:
I burned all your pictures and I tore all your clothes
Girl you still have my laptop and you still owe me dough
I paid three fourths of the rent, you gave me nothing but grief
You need to get out my life, yeah I need some some relief

Don't like the way you look at me, I've had enough
Don't like the shit you're texting me, calling me up
Don't like the things you said to me, all of your lies
You'll never get me back, no matter how hard you try

CHORUS:
Because I'm single and I'm famous
All these people know what my name is
While I'm touring the world you're eating at Mickey D's
You chill with freshman year roommates I roll with celebrities

K.FLAY:
I trashed your love letters took you out of my phone
Boy when you call my cell all I see is unknown
I waited six whole months while you went to Japan
Now you're turning on the radio and hearing this jam

MC LARS &amp; K.FLAY
Don't like the tone you take with me, I've had enough
Don't like your friends and family, calling me up
Don't like your fake excuses, all of your lies
You'll never get me back, no matter how hard you try

CHORUS:
Because I'm single and I'm famous
All these people know what my name is
While I'm touring the world you're eating at Mickey D's
You chill with freshman year roommates I roll with celebrities

MC LARS:
I never liked your little dog and the way that your Mom
Made me feel that day in Pacifica
I never liked the way you always talked about your ex-boyfriends
And all the dirty things that they did to ya
How you dissed my friends and you dissed my parents
Every time we went out, well you made it quite apparent
That you weren't happy and it wasn't enough
Even when we went to Europe and I bought you stuff

K.FLAY:
Now I'm ripping every track, I never want you to come back
Send you off like Moses floating down the Nile
Well the crap you can cut it, after that kiss my buttocks
Cause the crowd all loving my style
Unattached boys all up on my ass, yeah you can do the math, I'm good to go
I'm the best you ever had, just thought I'd let you know

CHORUS:
Because I'm single and I'm famous
All these people know what my name is
While I'm touring the world you're eating at Mickey D's
You chill with freshman year roommates I roll with celebrities</pre>
