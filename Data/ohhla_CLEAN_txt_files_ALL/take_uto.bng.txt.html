[Intro]

And this track is dedicated to all the ladies out there

Especially you girl

[Hook]
Let me take you to the movies, shorty
I'm sure later on you will be my baby
Let's sit down and just be by my side
I got the popcorn I know what else you like

[Bangs]
Hey shorty, you really looking nice
Let me take you the movie cause I know you like
You got nothing to worry about
Hold the popcorn and the drink
Let me pay the money so we can get in
Now hold my hand
and take a step to the door
Be Careful Don't fall
Lets sit on those two chairs alone
Watching a movie
So we can see whats going on
If you don't like to watch you can lean on my chest
Take a rest do your best
Baby Girl
(Yehaw!)

[Hook]

[Bangs]
I hope you enjoyed the movie Cause I did too
Anytime you wanna go again, Just holla at me
Baby girl we can make It to be better than before
Anything you want me to do, I can do it for sure
You can be my Cinderella
When it rains, you can stand under my umbrella
I know it make us feel better
Im not like other boyz

coming from the sky
Whatever I say I never lie
Just let me know if you wanna go somewhere

[Hook]

[Bangs]
Hey shorty where you at where you going can I see you later
Cause I can see you busy right now,
