[Chorus 2X: samples from Wiz Khalifa's "Glass House"]
Candy coated, bendin corners, dip, dip, wheelin
Candy-candy coated, bendin corners, dip, dip, wheelin
Candy-candy coated, bendin corners, dip, dip, wheelin
Made a killin bumper-bumper grill and chandeleir ceiling

[Chamillionaire]
Now let me roll my sleeve up, while you go get your G's up
I'm a boss I'll cut you off if I think you a schemer
Had to get my team up, and had to get my cream up
Plus that +Wu+ had told ya that the +Cash Rule Everything+ huh
After dem Katrina now we don't wait for FEMA
We get back up on our feet and slab a candy Beemer
I can't be no dreamer, and plus my girl a diva
Keep her happy and that nappy wet as Aquafina
I'm starchin from the cleaners and plus I'm grippin real wood
We repped that before Pimp died and I feel like we still should
Show 'em how the grill look, them swangers on the wheel shook
Get the chips then purchase whips because it make me feel good
I be like

[Chorus]

[Chamillionaire 2X over Chorus]
Talkin 'bout.. talkin 'bout
I'm bendin corners on them mayne

[Chamillionaire]
I got some good advice, fo' ya if they get a mic, fo' ya
Make it for these boys who drop the syrup in the Sprite sodas
Screwed up Southern type, flowers say that he a dice, roller
Just be careful this ain't somethin you should bet your life, over
Hope the lizard Gei-co ya cause you better be insured
You gon' come to Texas with that then you better be for sure
You should hear that kitty purr, no this jacket's not for her
You can't even see the piece that's right my chest look like a blur
Left you critics chopped in, got my weapon cocked in
It's not even in the spot I'm 'sposed to have it locked in
Caddy that I'm droppin, make you erase your top ten
That's if you talkin cars or broads - whatever - I got options
I'm in my

[Chorus] + [same Cham talking over as before]

[Interlude]
Wanna be a baller; shot caller
Twenty inch blades, on the Impala
That's how we ride
Southside we roll on choppers
Talkin 'bout top notch hoes, get the most not the lesser
Twenty-five lighters on my dresser, dresser
Shockin rockin do the Southside, Southside, mayne
Talkin 'bout diamonds all in your face~!

[Chamillionaire]
Now what the hell you meanin trick? Texas too legit
Plus I got my hammer in case a jacker wanna trip
Leanin on the switch, seated on the stitch
Hit that Waffle House and get completed with the grits
Yellow think she slick, gotta be that Mag-a-num
Horses under the hood and maybe on the ranch like Jazz and them
Swicthes just be tattlin, mad because we slabbin 'em
When you supercoat 'em it ain't nothin you can add to them
I be rollin

[Chorus] + [same Cham talking over as before]
