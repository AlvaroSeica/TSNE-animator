[Intro]
Yeh
They say I'm caught up in the hype 
I need to slow it down (aha)
I need to slow it down
I need to slow it down
down, down 
They say I'm caught up in the hype
They saying shit that I don't like
they need to tone it down
They say I'm sick up on the mic
and if I'm gonna show it
I'm gonna show it now

[Chorus]
They say I'm caught up in the hype
I need to slow it down
They saying shit that I don't like
they need to tone it down
They say I'm sick up on the mic
I need to throw it down
cos if I'm gonna show it
I'm gonna show it now
I need to throw it down
I need to throw it down
people say I'm sick up on the mic
I need to throw it down
I need to show em now
how we throw it down
cos if gonna show em
I'm gonna show em now

[Verse 1]
18 carat rhymes I find holding the pen
the way I spit makes me rich
like there's gold in my flem
your old rhymes, deserve to be
tossed in a bin, don't get me crossed
mines explode with the loss of a limb
Scribes with the midus touch
fuck the finest sluts,
I tokes blunts when my eyes is shut
and my account ain't in the minus much
so spineless cunts 
are trying to touch
us mindless thugs
that rhyme on drugs
and yeh feds wanna ban me rap
but getting snapped happy-slapped
we come strapped to get your family clapped
we kick our habit at 
this habitat and carry that
your so wack in fact
you'll be lucky to come out handicapped
Seen in court sitting, its the rapper / mortician
while I envision, the mechanism of the system
My lethal incision leave you in a fetal position
arrested on suspicion
of flipping rhythm with the composition

[Chorus]
They say I'm caught up in the hype
I need to slow it down
They saying shit that I don't like
they need to tone it down
They say I'm sick up on the mic
I need to throw it down
cos if I'm gonna show it
I'm gonna show it now
I need to throw it down
I need to throw it down
people say I'm sick up on the mic
I need to throw it down
I need to show em now
how we throw it down
cos if gonna show em
I'm gonna show em now</pre>
