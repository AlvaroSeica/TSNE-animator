Damn, damn, uh

{Verse 1 - J. Cole}
Damn, "Cole World"
I never thought I'd see the day that you my old girl
Now I'm stuck here hollerin at old girl
Got one, got two, three, four girls
Shotgun in the drop, made a right
Hut one, hut two, told them hoes take a hike
Then it's on to the next, on, on, to the next one
Hard to move on when you always regret one (one ...)

[Verse 2 - Miguel]
I wonder sometimes
I wondered if I, was wrong
Tryin to do right by you got me here
Now all I am is alone

[Break - Miguel]
'Cause her eyes, those hips and that ass
Don't compare, at all, no
And at best, all they do is distract me but now
Deep down, when I face it

[Chorus - Miguel]
All I want is you
All I want is you, now
All I want is you now
Now that you're gone, gone, gone

[Verse 3 - Miguel]
'Cause being your friend, is killin me softly
Hear voices, wonder where I went wrong
It was my fault and the wrong time, I wonder so often
Regret it's exhaustin

[Break]

[Chorus - Miguel]
All I want is you, hmm
All I want is you, now
All I want is you now
Sugar, now that you're gone, gone, gone

[Chorus - Miguel]
All I want is you, oooh
All I want is you, now
All I want is you now
Baby, now that you're gone, gone, gone, gone, gone

[Verse 4 - Miguel]
'Cause they don't smile, or smell like you
'Cause they don't make me laugh, or even cook like you
'Cause they don't photograph, nah they don't sex like you
Let's face it, I can't replace it, that's why all I want is you now

[Verse 5 - J. Cole]
Yeah, yeah
I hit the club when you left me thinkin that can heal shit
Tryin to celebrate my "Independence Day," Will Smith
Baby girl who I'm kiddin, still sick, real shit
All my new hoes seem to get old, real quick
And could it be, you everything that these plain bitches couldn't be
Is it a sign from the Lord that I shouldn't be?
Lost in the player way, so they get old to me
Got me on layaway, girl you got a hold on me
I say I'm wrong, you say come again
Damn, said I was wrong, look don't rub it in
I got a lot on my mind, got a flock full of dimes
Like a line full of hoes, how they comin in
Just sayin, don't wanna have me then somebody will
I'm playin, weight on my chest like I body build
I'm prayin, you ain't content with tryin to do your thing
And come back baby, boomerang ('rang ...)

[Chorus - Miguel] - w/ ad libs
That's why all I want is you now
All I want is you, now
All I want is you now
Sugar, now that you're gone, gone, gone, gone, gone

You know that you're gone, gone, gone
I want you back</pre>
