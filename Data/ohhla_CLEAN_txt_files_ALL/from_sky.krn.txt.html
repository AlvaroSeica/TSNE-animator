(*talking*)
Ya'll wanna know how God really works
Ain't no hocus pocus, it's bout hard work and focus
Don't be looking on your do' step

[K-Rino]
Think it dream it, plan it pray on it
Will it build it, focus stay on it
See it chase it, believe it channel it
Picture yourself with it, before you physically handle it
And grab it watch it, feed it nurse it
Guard it, from anyone who might attempt to curse it
Frequently treat it, while never showing a weakness
Hold it and never leak it, keep your vision a secret
Work for it, no time for crying and debating
Understand patience, doesn't mean lying round and waiting
It's a long road, but you'll accomplish it if it's meant
If you running a marathon, why would you practice for a sprint
Gotta build up your strength, through the pain and the suffering
If you trained to fight fifty rounds, twelve ain't nothing
No gaining if you complaining, no advancement if you napping
Anything you trying to do, it's up to you to make it happen

[Chorus - 2x]
We gotta learn that, blessings don't fall from the sky
If you want something, be willing to do all that applies
Gotta get your hands dirty, preservering through the tests
Say a prayer get to work, and let God do the rest

[K-Rino]
Blessings waiting, but your impatience is running them away
Nothing happens overnight, except the coming of a day
I heard a lot of people say, they gotta see it to believe it
But believing in the unseen, is the best way to achieve it
Gotta move on your vision, disregard what doubters said
God wants to raise you up, but he can't help you if you scared
So I weave through the detracting, slandering and laughing
While wearing spiritual vests, to protect me from dream assassins
Now what's a dream assassin, I appreciate you asking
That's somebody you tell your goals, and then they start blasting
Shooting at your dreams, trying to knock em off the radar
Trying to discourage you, and make you miserable like they are
But a weak thinker, could never conquer a strong mind
Keep pushing, even if it might take you a long time
If you run into a couple of set backs, and then quit
That means, you never had belief to begin with

[Chorus - 2x]

[K-Rino]
The world is yours, you walking it passively with fear
You expect your problems solutions, to magically appear
Don't be bathing in depression, you destined to be a great one
You need some money, stop begging for a job and make one
Never envy one's talent, go to the real source
Don't be jealous of em, just ask God to reveal yours
Gain from your losses, whatever happened was meant to
Don't let no felony no drug habit, or hate revenge you
Focus on your life, several hours a night
You can't fight the power, till you gain the power to fight
(I ain't finish school) so what, (I had a child) so what
God makes a way out of nothing, punks fold up
Degrees and diplomas, don't guarantee dollars
I done seen drop out millionaires, and homeless scholars
Like I said many times, my objective is to help you
Cause I'm everything I'm saying, I'm telling it to myself too

[Chorus - 2x]</pre>
