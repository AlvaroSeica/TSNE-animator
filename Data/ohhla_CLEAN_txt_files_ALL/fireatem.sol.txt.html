[Intro: Solomon Childs]
Yeah, we don't want that fat bitch, nigga...
Yo... you can keep your fat ho, nigga, we don't want her.. haha...
Uh, uh, yeah, nigga... told you muthafucka, I'm running this shit, nigga
Niggas talking behind my fucking back, going to my mans
Telling them niggas shit about me
Stop fucking talking about me, nigga
Fuck is wrong with you, man?
Out with the old, in with the new, muthafucka

[Chorus: Solomon Childs]
Don't let 'em get too close to you
If they do, open up and fire at 'em
Open up and fire 'at am, open up and fire at 'em
Keep ya friends close, as well as the enemies
Close to you, so if they front, you can 
Open up and fire at 'em, open up and fire at 'em

[Solomon Childs]
Spit a genocide passion, verbal assassin
Burgundy blood colored turbans, criminalized sermons
Shots of burbon, suck dick and eat semen
I have 'em sweat like the AIDS fever
Vengeance like the emons, nine millimeter
Ransom notes, your baby moms in the trunk, let the mack kiss 'me in the gut
Laugh now, cry never, renaissance monopoly
Black Italy, death if you smell sympathy
This the point of no return, irritate 'em like a blister burn
Scorch 'em like Jack Mack oil, wrap ya kids in aluminum foil, get 'em

[Chorus]

[Solomon Childs]
Knowledge is superb, nigga, murder formula
Collected felonies from greed, travel at a miraculous speed
Thug shit on channel 187
Coming to you live on satellite
Live that New York clap-you-in-your-stomach life
Pipe game ya wife, spit out raps like prison blades
I want all the money, I push dubs as well as the trades
In the fashion of mafia order, blood thicker than water
The hood on my side, believe me
Speed at Mack 10, new Deini, new Guru
Rap bulletproof red pujo, inherited mahogany waters, instutionalized
Like Ma Ro Hutchinson on lock
You a bitch, confined to keep lock, shit, I'm the new ad in Roc
Slaughter your kings, blow your lock
This the art of war, tell me, is you ready to die?

[Chorus]

[Outro: Solomon Childs]
You already know, man, I'm telling you
B-Town, slaughterhouses, Staten Island
New York City, it's been a long time since Staten Island got they time to shine
It's been a long time... it's been a long time...</pre>
