"Matthew 16:26"
For what is a man profited
if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul?
Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?

[K-Rino]
Yeah, we used to wake up fiending
To right words in between
The paper's lines that had meaning
Seeking hood recognition fighting for precision
Being strengthened by the competition
But once the game started growing
Struggles came without us knowing
And the pain started showing
We took pride in intellect and skill
Now you gotta have some sex appeal to get a record deal
And if you did come correct they soon made ya change ya tune
Once they called you in that special room
They pimping you but you too weak to fight
Without your manhood I don't see how you can sleep at night
We the ones they tried to ruin
When we started spewing facts on what the government was doing
Somebody needs to break the street
Cuz Master got these fake gangstas sitting down to take a leak

[K-Rino]
Ha-ha
You got a nice new pretty car
A chain and a female that you purchased at the titty bar
Five million in your bank account
But a buncha friends and family that you never think about
Just analyze how you looking dude
Don't even wanna feed the same folks who helped you cook the food
You chose money over pride, denied everybody
Locked in the internal courtship with the Illuminati
Then you blowed up over night
Did what you was told to do and wrote what you was told to write
But K-Rino is broke form the mold of dolomite
With no letting go of my creative control in sight
Shoutout to Savage Mike and Paragon
I won't stop until the the whole world done heard Farrakhan
I keep my soul like Sarah Vaughan
We got long wind, you're like a fool with one lung in a marathon

[K-Rino]
Ha-ha
You started climbing up the public ladder
Weeks after the Devil made you switch and change your subject matter
And if you buck they go the exta mile to swallow you
And start piling tons of propaganda just to silence you
Most people would say, "HELL NO!!"
When you ask them "Have they ever heard of COINTELPRO?"
They out to murder any black who's formidable
You know why King was really killed? He started getting political
See, they don't mind you being famous
Until you start speaking God's language, then you're dangerous
And now he MUST be eliminated
After threats, 99% become intimidated
You turned your back on those who bled with ya
They out the picture now that Satan's in the bed with ya
We should catch you and cut your thumbs off
For selling out the hood when they threaten to cut your funds off</pre>
