[Hook 4.25X: Long Axe]
Early to rise, it's time to get paid
Early to bed, it's time to get laid

[Chorus: Long Axe]
It ain't hard to live my life this way
Wake up in the morning, a brand new day
Do what's right and then say it to ya face
Y'all gotta do me right, right, love life, live

[Long Axe]
Aiyo it's hard to get people out your head
And it's also hard to get my ass out of bed
I start with one leg tryna clear up my head
Got a brand new thing tryna make this bread
Step on the train everybody so tense
Looking at me close face filled with suspense
So chilled and it don't make sense as I'm a Pisces
Women on the tryna get my heart spicy
Veins remain icy 'cause y'all like me
Give them two months and they'll be ready to fight me
Homeless, asking for more than a five
Saying since George Bush the price of begging gonna rise
It's gonna rise 'til the skies turn red
Can't stop the Most High though my eyes ain't red
It's a problem getting out of the bed
Yo, it's a problem getting out of the bed

[Chorus]

[Long Axe]
I'm pushing through the crowd cat face with a rat race
Chasing this cheese ain't me, so I back space
You might like having titles and names
That arsehole position got an opening for main
In the same lane, used to own the whole earth
Now you gotta watch it take a toll on your Old Earth
You think drinking is a social affair
When you drunk you throwing up your emotions with beer
And stress got your hairline flying like an airline
Mind like a picket sign, please stop where I'm
going to, it's a place called home
Tomorrow they can leave me alone

[Chorus]</pre>
