[Talking]
Ha Ha. You know what it is. GymClassHeroes
The Dream. Its hard to look innocent
when I got cookie crumbs all over my face and shit
Ha ha. You get it

[Chorus]
I like girls, they like me
They look so good in they satin jeans
Said you could be the one, and my only
I wanna be faithful but I can't keep my hands out the cookie jar

My hands, my hands, my hu uh, my hands can't keep 
My hands, my hands, my uh my, can't keep
My hands, my hands, my uh my, can't keep
My hands, my hands, my hands out the cookie jar

[Verse 1]
You see I got this problem I need help trying to solve it
Cause meeting after meeting and I'm still a cookie holic
You could hide em I'm a find em on the counter in the closet
And I'll say I ain't do it with my face covered in chocolate
My girl be setting booby traps to catch me eating scooby snacks
I left crumbs in the bed once, but I told her I was through with that
She still don't be believing me and I guess that I'm cool with that
But I gotta sweet tooth that a never come loose and the truth of the matter is

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I got a thing for millano, bascoti, italianos
And I never turn down some oreos if you got those
Butter pecan, Puertorican, or them oatmeal raising Asians
Hazelnut Brazilians, macadamia caucasians
Double stuffed or thin mint it don't matter you getting it
Cause I gotta sweet tooth that a never come loose and the fact of the matter is

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I'm a monster for these cookies I'm a beast for they treats
A animal for they crackers head to feet they so damn sweet
Can't keep my hands, my hands, my hu uh, my, can't keep
My hands, my hands, my hands out the cookie jar

[Talking]
And there you have it. Ha ha. I tried my best
I went to cookie anonymous. Guess I'm a failure
I can't seem to keep my damn hands out the cookie jar
but it is what it is</pre>
