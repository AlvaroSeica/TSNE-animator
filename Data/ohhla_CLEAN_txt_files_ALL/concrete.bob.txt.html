Bob Marley: Even the spiritual environment,
igher divinity, Rastaman 
dilution which is like earth create, 
because the earth come back from what it wants,
 Someone is trying to be as powerful as god.

*Scratches*
Here's a little story that must be told. (2x) 
Come On (2X)
Concrete Jungle
Here's a little story that must be told. (2x)
Come On (2X)

Verse 1:
No solution in my day today, 
The high yellum won't come out to play, 
I said darkness has covered my life, (oooh)
And has changed order, (oooh)
Where is this love to be found (Where's this love to be found)
I would say that life must be somewhere to be found (Sweet life)
Instead of Concrete Jungle, (Jungle, oh, oh oh,)
Concrete Jungle, (Jungle)
Man you have to do your thing yeah. (Jungle)
Oh yeah.

Scratches:
Come On

No chains around my feet but I'm not free, here now
I know I am bound here in captivity
Ooohhhh.
Never know 
Never known happiness
Never known
Never known what real
Well I'm always laughing like a clown (oh)
I said I've, I've got to be passing from off the ground yeah (oh, instead of)
Concrete Jungle (Jungle)
Illusions, Illusions (Concrete Jungle)
Concrete Jungle (Concrete Jungle)
Oh, no no  no
Concrete Jungle

Rakim:
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah (come on)
In the lions den, 
You hear the cry of the dying men, 
The lions in, 
Every puddle about it then
You try and win go against the blind to win
It'll put the eye of the tiger in iron men
The heart beats like animals in dark street, 
Starve to eat, 
In the jungle it's concrete, 
Instead of wood we use the metal to draw heat, 
The habitats the hood, 
They single the god beats
The tribals in a deadly game of survival,  
Genicidial,
Read you Koran and your Bible,  
When the merciful get merciless
We need to read Psalms 82 verse 6
Its real so make you sure you do real thing, 
Females never forget your still queens,
Feel it till you feel free with wings, 
And the male we ain't got to kill to be kings

Concrete Jungle (Jungle) (Come on now)
