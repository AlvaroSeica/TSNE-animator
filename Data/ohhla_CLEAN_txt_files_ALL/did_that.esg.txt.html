[Chorus] 
I done came down, I done came through 
I done swung red, I done swung blue 
I done rolled fo's, slammed candy do's 
Everything you boys said, done did that befo' 
Heard you getting do' bro, did that befo' 
Stole him for the low, yeah we did that befo' 
Po'd up a fo', yeah we did that befo' 
Made her drop it low, yeah we did that befo' 

[E.S.G.] 
Heard you got flow, and you shut down the show 
That ain't nothing bro, we done did that befo' 
Hit the highway, with a trunk full of snow 
Short to 34, yeah we did that befo' 
Had a chocolate dunky, and a snow bunny pro 
Gave a rapper the mic, yeah we did that befo' 
Shut down the town, with them pounds of the dro 
O.G. of the bubble, yeah we did that befo' 
Escalade and Benzo, presidential flo' 
Obama limos, yeah we did that befo' 
Took my shit to Screw, chop it up and ride slow 
In my Pimp C voice, bitch I did that befo' 

[Chorus] 
I done came down, I done came through 
I done swung red, I done swung blue 
I done rolled fo's, slammed candy do's 
Everything you boys said, done did that befo' 
Get money on your block, we did that befo' 
Patron Goose on rocks, we done did that befo' 
Big stuff your own school, yeah we did that befo' 
Dropping grands on your jewels, yeah we did that befo' 

[E.S.G.] 
Heard you kicking in do's, make em lay down on the flo' 
Took the work and the do', yeah we did that befo' 
Hey Cadillacs we did that, TV screens with leather black 
Ever trick or ever snitch, hell naw never that 
Doing it big we did that, splitting wigs we did that 
Flipped seven birds to fitty, I guess I Michael Vick'd that 
Jose by the six pack, homie where your pits at 
My bloodline a beast, cause she done made me sixty racks 
White and yellow we did that, now my diamonds pitch black 
Made the strap go click-clack, bet you never did that 
Homie where your kitchen at, that's where I work my wrists at 
I'm married to the game, Baby where my kiss at 

[Chorus] 
I done came down, I done came through 
I done swung red, I done swung blue 
I done rolled fo's, slammed candy do's 
Everything you boys said, done did that befo' 
Finally getting your ends, we did that befo' 
Green Gucci lens, did that befo' 
Thousand grams in the bag, did that befo' 
You and baby popping tags, we did that befo' 

[E.S.G.] 
Louie belt buckle, with the Gucci's on your toes 
Check my resume, we did that befo' 
20-22's, 23's-24's 
26-28's, yeah we did that befo' 
Send a hundred thousand pills, half a mill on the flo' 
I'm quarter milling twenty's, yeah we did that befo' 
No penitentiary do's, now we slamming Bentley do's 
Superbowl and All-Star game, we front row 
Pop trunk we thoed, get ran out of do' 
You sold the fiends soap, yeah we did that befo' 
Big boy swag first class, I'm getting mail 
Gorilla super fly, Levi's YSL 

[Chorus] 
I done came down, I done came through 
I done swung red, I done swung blue 
I done rolled fo's, slammed candy do's 
Everything you boys said, done did that befo' 
Heard you getting do' bro, did that befo' 
Stole him for the low, yeah we did that befo' 
Po'd up a fo', yeah we did that befo' 
Made her drop it low, yeah we did that befo'</pre>
