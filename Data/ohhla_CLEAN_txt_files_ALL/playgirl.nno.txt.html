(Verse 1)
Now we gon' take a little trip down memory lane
Playgirl, you the one, can I get your name
Holla back, cop a sack, then I pick your brain
And your boyfriend, well, he a straight up lame
I wanna
I wanna be your lover
I wanna be your friend
My pocket's swoll up
Homies' paper thin, yep
I play the game to win
We skinny dip and swim
Blow that dro, ma, sip the juice and gin, nope
Patron con limon, Nino flirt with you
Smoke a cigs, girl I digs, be close to you
Ven aqui, feelin' me, when I'm holdin' you
Ecstacy, you and me, girl, I swear to you
Nino spit game like a champion
Them other cats be trickin' a capitan

Refrain: Nino Brown
Girl, I ain't the one, but we gon' have some fun
Ain't no strangs attached, mama, I got your back

Chorus: Melvin Riley {Nino Brown}
And I just wanna say
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You complete me {You complete me, baby}
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Everything
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah {All day, everyday}
Heaven, you say
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You complete me {Playgirl}

(Verse 2)
I slide through, round two, we gon' rendez-vous
Snuggled up, next to me, in my Chevy coup
Tell your mans, "Don't worry," you'll be home at two
Disconnect your phone case he come lookin' for you
See, I'm a superbad dude, when I'm grindin' for chips
But there's somethin' about you, when you lickin' 'em lips
Nino Beezy tatoo'ed inbetween them hips
Girl, you so damn thick
It's so damn sick
We keeps it
We keeps it undercover
So never tell your friends
Yeah, I'm a gangsta love
Plus I'm a gentleman
We stroll in sandy beaches
You love to hold my hand
It's like computer lovin'
With ya (I Wanna Be Your Man)
With ya painted on, sexy cut C.K. jeans
Body lookin' like you was on a relay team

Repeat Refrain

Repeat Chorus

Hook: Nino Brown
You lookin' like
Candy (So sexy, mama)
We sippin' on
Brandy (It feel good, mama)
Candlelights come in
Handy
Playgirl
Understand it, I'm a P-I-M-P (Oooh, wee)

[Verse 3: Nino Brown (Melvin Riley in background)]
This ain't no
This ain't no groupie love (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
We sip the finest bub's
Jacuzzi marble tub, baby lookin' fabulous (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I ain't the one, but we gon' have some fun (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
G strings collapse (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I got your back
Break it down, pimp

Bridge: Melvin Riley
Now I know
What's it like
To be with someone real
No more silly lies or games
I'm for real
I've had enough for me to see
That's not the way
I'll let it be

Repeat Chorus {with variations}

[Melvin Riley]
I just
Wanna
Say
That you
Complete me (I just wanna say)
I just
Wanna
Say (I just wanna say)
That you
Complete me
I just
Wanna
Say (Every part of me)
That you
Complete me (My heart, my soul, my mind)
I just
Wanna (Oh oh)
Say (I just wanna say)
That you
Complete me
Oh oh</pre>
