Ya out there? 
Ya out there? 
Where ya at? 
This is for the real
 
Verse 1
We on a search mission
For a breed that's long been missin
Spark your izm and embark on this expedition
To the lost world, cities where zombies live in
Take a wrong turn enter the walls of prisons
Lost religions, blocks of abandoned buildings
Cops and children
Battle on blocks like pilgrims vs the injuns
Venture inside this kingdom
Thirst for vengeance led to their own instinction
Best description reads like a wanted poster
Life on the fast lane speeds like a rollercoaster
Life and times recorded in rhyme
Which we dug in these archeological finds
Endangered species who didn't get the memo
And now that they deceased we ID 'em by they demos
Platinum time capsules
Mass grave for burial sites
Excavate they tombstones for bones and iron mics
 
Hook:
War torn, city streets with the hardest blocks
When I speak ain't no warning shots
Send a message for my people from all the spots
Whether east coast, west coast, north, south
Where you at?
For those who can weather the storm
From the ones who wanted beef
To my brothers in arms
Know before you put this on
Better back up and read the seal
This is for the real
 
Verse 2
They use to mention the skills
Before they would mention the bills
Or would mention the steel
Or would bend for a deal
Told the truth without fear
Rhymed without care
Rhymed without when the sound went out... you out there?
No response I can't tell if dead or in jail
Dumbed down 'til they brain dead, still couldn't sell
Disappeared in a spell
Couldn't find 'em, believe I went looking an failed
From the top of the mainstream down to the underground
Man its weird the real ain't nowhere to be found
Just some clowns who try to replicate the sounds
Plus some old folks who forgot how to get down
That's when I realized I'm the last of the boxers
When artists are boxed in or dead in a box
So now, I am legend
Last man living
Crown me king
Bow down or fetch your weapon
 
Hook:
War torn, city streets with the hardest blocks
When I speak ain't no warning shots
Send a message for my people from all the spots
Whether east coast, west coast, north, south
Where you at?
For those who can weather the storm
From the ones who wanted beef
To my brothers in arms
Know before you put this on
Better back up and read the seal
This is for the real
 
Outro:
I can't hear you...these guys are crazier than you man come on!... 
where are you? come on!Â…
hey hey hey hey come on!...hey hey hey
