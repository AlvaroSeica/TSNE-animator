"The league crew"

[Keyshia Cole]
Time is gonna think that I do, do
The thing about you treat me like you do, do
Keep me held down, when no one else was found
You showed me love

[Verse One] [Rhymefest]
S-s-s-s so you say
Used to diss me everyday
Now she happy, Little Scrappy
See me, she like, "Okay K"
Naw bitch naw
Down with your drawers
You gon' need some Tylenol
For my head
Tag Team said, "Take it to the house"
Naw, we gon' take her to the bed
And kick you out
Put you out
For the times you wasn't puttin' out
Take off your shoe
You fienda put your foot in your mouth
I got my new
Hoe
So what the fuck I'ma need you fo'?
Matter of fact I'ma need you to go
Hop back in your broke Yugo
And that go double for these bitch ass niggas
These snitch ass niggas
You just can't get rich ass niggas
Rhymehold's my crew
Sunday through Monday I'm out on the block
With of bundle of money like Russell who touchin' you
Wasn't you, nothin', who bustin' you lames?
So Pusha Man fienda go out and get money

[Chorus] [Kanye West]
Game gettin' unusual maine
Go to war like Bush for change
You don't know, then you'se a lame
Maine, not a pusha man
Maine, not a pusha man
Maine, not a pusha man
You don't know, then you'se a lame
Maine, not a pusha man

[Verse Two] [Bump J]
Get the O's and bag 'em up
Get the shit off fast as fuck
I give you a pack, you don't wanna get clapped
You better have my dust
Ask the hoes 'bout my pimp game
Spit game insane
Get brain while a nigga switch lane
Momma short when the rent came
So her youngest boy had no choice but to go out and flip caine
Now I'm caught up in the mix maine
I let a clip bang
Runnin' round lookin' for that big stain
100 niggas gonna follow and the models
If it don't make dollars then it don't make sense, lame
Since the birth been hustlin'
I don't hurt for nothin'
Get rid of bricks like I work construction
If I ever kick off, front line with the iron, I'm the first one bustin'
If you ever run up I'ma hurt you cousin'
Swisher Sweet full of that purple stuff then
Bump is on and it hurts you doesn't it?
Chump
I got my...

[Chorus] [Kanye West]
Game gettin' unusual maine
Go to war like Bush for change
You don't know, then you'se a lame
Maine, not a pusha man
Maine, not a pusha man
Maine, not a pusha man
You don't know, then you'se a lame
Maine, not a pusha man

[Verse Three] [Kanye West]
How can you say Kan is, so pompous?
You ain't been to his concerts?
You just talking that nonsense
He in the same league Nas is
Or Jay is
My favorite
A lot of people say that's where 'Ye is
Though a freshman still the West man
One of the Best Man like Taye Diggs
And I was oh so patient
Why niggas straight disrespectin' 'em?
So I did what they ain't expect from 'em
Dropped the Drop Out and blazed 'em
And ain't nobody feel my pain
Until the hits that I came with
I'm Kanye not Kane 
But to you
I'm Rick James bitch

[Chorus] [Kanye West]
Game gettin' unusual maine
Go to war like Bush for change
You don't know, then you'se a lame
Maine, not a pusha man
Maine, not a pusha man
Maine, not a pusha man
You don't know, then you'se a lame
Maine, not a pusha man

[Verse Four] [Bump J]
And they said I couldn't take it, said I wouldn't make it
Hate it that I'm this far
Hate to see Bump in that big car
But I flix hard when I spit bars
You got's to listen I come from the gutter
Do you know what it took to get these rocks to glisten?
On the block with biscuits I copped and pitched it
Back then I didn't have a pot to piss in
And to all my women that's caught up in the struggle
That gotta strip just to pay tuition
Baby daddy trippin', I feel your pain
If you don't know then you'se a lame
I give you food for brain
And I'ma do my thang just like I'm supposed to
I had to quit the game, I used to flip the caine
Now I'm spittin' flames on these Pro Tools
Young bloods from my niggas in the old school
I know exactly what y'all gotta go through
Keep pushin' it's gonna go through
I'm yo proof

[Chorus] [Kanye West]
Game gettin' unusual maine
Go to war like Bush for change
You don't know, then you'se a lame
Maine, not a pusha man
Maine, not a pusha man
Maine, not a pusha man
You don't know, then you'se a lame
Maine, not a pusha man</pre>
