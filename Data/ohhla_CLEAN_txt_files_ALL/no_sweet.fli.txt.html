[Intro - Patience]
Wake up, and break down
Wake up, and break down

[Verse 1 - Patience]
I look back to when the only issues I had were those of Rap Pages
4080 or The Source but lately I'm in the laststages
My windpipe is exit-only tonight
I feel like my own mother wouldn't know me tonight
At the sight of werewolf eyes that's lonely but bright
Brown vacant, no sweet tooth, I owe you my life
Boire de l'eau but I reject it, ring-collar of chalk
All we do is talk, no actions for the answers we got
And last summer I went crazy
It was a change within the arteries that raised me into safety
Baby these days lately conversation don't engage me
Drain my batteries and you're gonna have to replace me
One after the other I lose my functions first my hearing goes
Sight, taste, feeling: extremes in ears and toes
Sense of smell gone, close my eyes and I'm weak
It happens every night, jimmy-leg, go to sleep

[Hook - Patience]
I wake up every morning to the same thing
And break down every evening at the same place
I wake up every morning to the same thing
And break down every evening at the same place

So wake up, and break down
So wake up, and break down

[Verse 2 - Bender]
I feel like I've been spending my days inside an insane asylum
Been trying to escape from vaporizing in a basin of Volcano Island
I'm counting sheep by leaps and bounds a thousand deep
But falling sound asleep is outta reach beyond the clouds and mountain peaks
Hell, I'm jealous of your nightmares, I climb stairs to lie there
While I stare a dark sky bearing down on me
Whole town's asleep but crying out loud like mouths to feed
Forgot how to dream, ground my teeth to powder while the hours creep by
Mixing a drink to keep that shit that I think from getting to me
Not getting a wink for weeks and now the minute I blink
I'm sittin' singing: "Oh, Lord, could this be my time?
Lay these bones to rest, bang my head off the table"
And finally I roll my eyeballs back
I put the night Nytol tab in my highball glass
Sleep finally appears, I hold out my arm to reach 'em
Just to hear my alarm clock going off - carpe diem
