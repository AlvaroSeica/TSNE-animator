Robbery
Robbery
Robbery (Run)
Robbery (Give it up)

Your destination is a casket, when I put on my mask kid
My task is seeing green, killing you without being seen
That's the plan, you get swollen up when I stick G
Your shits getting stolen, I'm rolling up on you quickly
I'm taking your Tommy Hilfiger coat close line from behind
with the razor to this niggers throat
Stand still  don't make my hand kill
Fuck around, end up in a land filth all over a Grand Ville
Money's something you should have gave up
Now your family has to dig a grave up  If your one of them bitch
Nigger rich, nigger with fancy clothes
You'll get attacked by a mental case and strangers covered with pantyhose
I'm blasting anyone that has a found, get messed up with a pound
By a man dressed up as a clown
You'll be tripping me gentle lightly with no justice you'll die G
Plus you can't identify me

  Robbery (Kid running)
  Robbery (Give it up bitch)
  Robbery (Hand it over Fuck)
  Robbery
  Robbery (Give it up)

I'm attacking you dressed up like a villain from Cobra, I'm sober
Wearing the mask like it was the end of October
Your life is over. In your pants you're peeing when I pull out my fucking
three pounds and represent like I'm skiing
I'm dropping shit in you, you wanna see I'll rehearse it on you
Try to fucking rob me I'll flip it kid and reverse it on you
Even if you're only seven you'll become a victim quicker than Sonja Preven
You'll get sent to the lonely heaven
Don't go around on places I lurk, whore
Cuz I go berserk, whore, everything you fucking work for
Don't think I won't cut your wench throat
I got a shotgun under the trench coat
Plus when I get greedier, the media eats it up in you
Fucking reporters get boneless when Necro slaughters throws roamers on video
recorders
When I'm wicking there's always a face on my spadge
And if I'm seen from taking the green then I'm shaving off my moustache

Robbery (Run in her)
Robbery (Put it in the bag punk)
Robbery (Give it to me bitch)
Robbery (Empty your pockets and die son)
Robbery

(mimicking old woman)
"Oh! They stole my wallet! They took my pocket book.
 Police? He took my money. That white man over there"
