[Intro]
Gonna kill them, gonna kill them
Gonna kill them, gonna kill them
Gonna kill them, gonna kill them
Gonna kill them...

[Chorus]
Ha-ha-haaaa-haaard - hard as they come
Ha-ha-haaaa-haaard - hard as they come
Ha-ha-haaaa-haaard - hard as they come
Ha-ha-haaaa-haaard - hard as they come

[Natti]
I'm a monster that don't reside up under your bed 
I'ma march to the beat that I put into your head 
Send shots to your liver, I deliver you death 
You can barter your tomorrow, but a martyr you're left 
Get you hot under the collar when my name's on your breath 
Click the starter on your Impala, I'll be there when you wreck 
Fuckin with me, you better keep your feelings in check 
Be the life of the party or a lifeless body 
Get with me thinkin you hard, you'll be hardly standin 
I'm the hardest of them all, you're the hardest landin 
face first in the asphalt, yo' ass talked, too wreckless 
Now you helpless from the rounds you caught 
I'll teach your ass a lesson, outlined in chalk 
Have you hostage in the hospice, high and tryin to walk 
I am bravery in a bottle, I am courage in a glass 
I got the government's approval, prohibition couldn't last 
I go HARD~!

[Chorus]

[Freddie Gibbs]
Fa'sho, yeah...
C'mon, let's ride out 
The whole family over for Christmas dinner 
Let's go through the purses and sell the gifts from your mom house 
They know you out here doin dirt for cash 
Plus you the one unemployed, a couple a-dollars ain't gon' hurt they ass 
I'm the only friend you got, you tried to sell me 
but you took a hit and eventually you just couldn't stop 
A couple of sniffs'll get you lit but couldn't get you to the top 
Oh what an event when you got hip to cookin me into them rocks 
I had you LOCKED, you know it costs to come and see me 
So fuck yo' groceries, fuck yo' bills, mayne g'on and pawn that TV 
And fuck yo' life, just catch this beam and take it straight to the dome 
And fuck yo' kids, the state'll seperate 'em and place 'em in homes 
It's gon' be cool, I know I got you crazy subdued 
Ever since the '80s played ya whole community for a fool 
And the ones that sold me smoke each other over new tennis shoes 
They field niggaz, I'm the definition of death, the real killa  [Chorus] [Interlude]
Gonna kill them, gonna kill them
Gonna kill them, gonna kill them
Gonna kill them, gonna kill them
Gonna kill them...

[Kno]
Yo...
I'm with the fiends on the block playin shoot 'em up 
When I erupt makes it hard to know who to trust 
People scared to test me since the '80s 
Anybody can get it -- man, woman, or baby 
Shots do not discriminate, impossible to eliminate 
I disseminate, you disintegrate
I can come off as a prick, you might get stuck with me 
I'll prol'ly steal your girl if you try and fuck with me 
cause next to me, you're looking quite frail 
and if you snitch, you'll be counting your days in white cells 
Needlessly in CB4, ask the, CDC, no CD4s' 
Cause the truth is I'm on America's dick 
Uncle Sam fucks the poor and it's makin 'em sick 
Now their life's in a tube, a downward spiral 
Give a new meaning to going viral, I'm hard as they come

[Chorus]

("Now that's hard, while we rantin and ravin 'bout gats
  Nigga they made them gats, they got some shit that'll blow out our backs
  From where they sta-..."
