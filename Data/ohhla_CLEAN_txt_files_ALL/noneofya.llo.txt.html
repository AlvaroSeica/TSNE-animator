Whoa... 
  
[Hook] 
It ain't none of yo business, how I ball in these streets 
What bad bitch, laying in my sheets 
And it ain't none of yo business, how I'm getting my do' 
Just know, that I get it on the low 
And it ain't none of ya business, so don't even ask 
How I get my money, how I'm stacking my cash 
  
[Lil' O] 
Boys always wanna ask O 
Ay what you pay for that, say what that cost bro 
They see me with a bitch, with a ass like whoa 
The first thing they gon' ask, is you fucking that hoe 
Well first things first, it ain't none of yo bis' 
Don't worry bout me, nigga worry bout your kids 
You tell em where you stay, man they run up in your crib 
You tell em what you scoring, you end up doing bids 
Man these boys is so nosy 
Look at all them hating, cause I'm sipping on some Rosay 
See me dap my essay, they say how you know Jose 
Oh that's where you get your work from, a stripper told me 
Well she don't know shit, and you niggaz so boldgy 
Peeping, with your looking ass 
Cause I'm burning bread, like I'm cooking cash 
Tell these boys your bis', get tooken fast 
Wanna know how to come up, stop with the trash 
  
[Hook] 
It ain't none of yo business, how I ball in these streets 
What bad bitch, laying in my sheets 
And it ain't none of yo business, how I'm getting my do' 
Just know, that I get it on the low 
And it ain't none of ya business, how I'm stacking my bread 
If it ain't these damn jackers, it's the FED's 
And it ain't none of yo business, so don't worry bout me 
All you gotta know, is nigga I'm a G 
  
[Wonderus] 
(it ain't none of yo business) 
Why you so nosy 
(it ain't none of yo business) 
Worry bout yourself 
  
[Slim Thug] 
Niggaz the new bitches, gossip like hoes 
Acting like they on they periods, when they see a hoe 
Quick talk with they opinion, when it ain't worth shit 
Before you give me some advice, get where I'm at bitch 
Trying to save my sluts, asking why they fuck with me 
Tell her now I'm a dog, I done fucked the whole city 
I'm like mayn, what part of the game is that 
And after all your hate, she still came right back 
Tal'n bout what I'm worth, and how a nigga don't spend 
Sound like a bunch of hoes, y'all niggaz ain't men 
Asking questions bout what I drive, and where I live 
Might be snitching trying to send them FED's, to my crib 
Keep my name out your mouth, 'fore I break it 
And next chance I get to bust ya head, I'ma take it 
Don't worry bout my money, if I'm the one that make it 
They see a playa shining, and they hoe ass hate it
