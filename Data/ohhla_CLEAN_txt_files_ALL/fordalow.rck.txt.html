[Verse 1]
Candi all in da paint, rims deep in da dirt
Gotta car full of work, nigga pocket's full of herb
Choppa on da front seat, sucka if you want beef
I'm in Dade County, I'm Da Mayor you can come see
Lookie here - I'm well known, what you say? (I'm well known)
Kush by da ell-bow, I love when it smell strong
Othaside of da bridge, niggas die just to live
You want a beach, don't sleep .45 to ya wig
Represent Carol City, Dirty South ride with me
M-I-Yayo on da map, now it's my city
Pullin' out da 7 trey, err otha day
Got bout 40 in it, hit ya ho' fo' 40 minutes

[Chorus]
Pull up on 'em 24's, while I'm leanin' on da doors
And I'm lettin' suckas know, dat I get it fo' da low
I get it fo' da low (Ross), I get it fo' da low
I get it for da low (Ross), I get it fo' da low
Pull up in dat white on white, know you wonda what it's like
Know you wonda what's da price, ain't nothang to a boss

[Chorus]
Pull up on 'em 24's, while I'm leanin' on da doors
And I'm lettin' suckas know, dat I get it fo' da low

[Verse 3]
Go on let ya top down, fuck it blow a couple grand
Treat her like an animal, make her do a hand Stand
Club Rolex (Lex), you can stunt yo
I stood on a rolex smokin' on a blunt ho' (Ross)
I'm heavy mayn', off in this chevy game
Dip it in da pretty paint, chromed out everythang
Take it back to da (Block), Triple C across the (Top)
In an oldschool motor brand new (Out da box)
Got bout a hundred (Killas), runnin' with a hundred (Niggas)
Tell it there to ya face, don't nobody want it (With us!!)
Niggas dead broke (Broke), they betta shake it off
Skycap ass niggas, mad dat we takin' off (Ross)

[Chorus - 2x]
Pull up on 'em 24's, while I'm leanin' on da doors
And I'm lettin' suckas know, dat I get it fo' da low
I get it fo' da low (Ross), I get it fo' da low
I get it for da low (Ross), I get it fo' da low
Pull up in dat white on white, know you wonda what it's like
Know you wonda what's da price, ain't nothang to a boss
I get it fo' da low (Ross), I get it fo' da low
I get it for da low (Ross), I get it fo' da low</pre>
