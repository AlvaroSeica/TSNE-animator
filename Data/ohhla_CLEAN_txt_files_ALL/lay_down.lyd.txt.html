Lay your head, on my pillow {*2X*}

Oh lay it down
Lay your head, on my pillow - yeah!

I ain't Casanova; me and Romeo ain't never been friends
But tonight girl I'ma show you how much I love you let the party begin
I'ma do somethin I never did to you girl
I'ma turn you out, I'll show you a new you girl
Tell your friends you ain't comin out tonight
Wrap your hair girl, tie it up tonight

[Chorus] w/ ad libs

[Lloyd]
You're lookin at me girl and I ain't talkin 'bout the look in your eyes
Me my potnah and them is giving a standin ovation girl tonight
So go on and stretch it out cause I'm gon' work it good girl
And don't be bougie cause tonight I need a hood girl
And I'ma tell my friends I ain't comin out tonight

All my fellas say layyy, layyy, layyy

Layyyyy, oh hayyyy
Oh lay, oh lay, oh lay, oh lay, oh lay your head down
