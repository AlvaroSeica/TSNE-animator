Heads bump negatives short circuit
controls can't work it
Glamorized picture perfect
See beyond the surface
Birds eye view like space rockets
Ain't dove reppin peace drop it
til hearts gain conscious
We spit over beats that melodic
Hypnotic
Enough to charge ya sockets
Wit heat like the tropics
Non stop ish
See clear like fibre optics
Chicken heads roam frantic
Golden egg tryna locate
Like Alexander the great
wanna rob my jewels but you wont see em shinin
I keep em in mind so can display or can hide em
Behind the learners wheel tryna drive cars
Rollin wit stars omar mukhtar style drive em out fast
Flee the desert space
Yo its quest rah and planets
make way
Rotating like the solar system
we don't play...</pre>
