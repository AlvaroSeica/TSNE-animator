Hahahahaha
You know what I mean
Just listen to that shit, just listen
Listen to bassline
Mh-mh-mh
How y'all niggas like this old enriched Oakland funk?

[ Opio ]
MC's they diss but wanna be subtle
'What can I say to disgruntle
Hieroglyphics? But then the rebuttal
That's trouble
Don't wanna get caught stuck on the mic
I know what it's like
I seen some niggas be victims last night
A pitiful sight
All four of 'em, they tight'
(Disguise it between the lines, man, it'll be aight)
Write rhymes in the limelight, can't afford excitement
Gotta be careful, down low when I recite it

[ Phesto ]
Cause you niggas are weak, immune to freakin shit surpressed 'em
Quarantined to malpractice with mics, you need to be arrested
Bridled for your recitals that suck
Dick infestin with your misconception
You can duck the mic with digress and babblin
Just establishin the fact your wack ass backwards-destined
Unimpressive, luster-lackin, you divulge in
Exposin your posin
Comin from no new angles
The same flows that keep us dozin

[ Pep Love ]
Okay okay players
Get your minds together and shit
Before you even think about tryin to rhyme

[ Opio ]
Got 'em terrified, let's clarify this shit, who bit?
Prepare to die for that spite, you cross me, you gets clips
Sendin 'em shockwaves
Beatin his rhyme until it's concave
Leavin his nerves wrecked, his eyes glazed
Raisin 'em out the misconception
That you stepped in the right direction
Souls of Mischief is perfection-ist
You need to miss this
Cause we get down to bidness
MC's if you resent us
When you rock don't offend us

[ Phesto ]
So I've assessed that we the best at what we do
And y'all are just decoration for the recreation
Fakin MC's with blatant disregard for makin the bump
My patience is up
Resign, Hieroglyphics divine, refined
You niggas redefine an assinine that's uninclined
To rhyme confined
To mindless diss behind in this decline
( ? ) swift about a second, if in time
Tryina diss, just bow and scrape
Cause Souls of Mischief whippin niggas in shape

[ Pep Love ]
Huh
Now how's about that?
It's Hieroglpyhics
Just to be frank it don't really get no better
Y'all can just listen
Examine
But I know you barely gon' do what it takes to stay afloat
It's Pep Love
To you niggas, to you bitches, to everybody that's listenin
This how we keep it together on this track, right?
Come take a trip with us
To where this nigga taketh y'all
No man's land

[ Tajai ]
I guess I'm good at the game of natural selectiveness
In the Wild Wild West
Where the beats got wah-wahs
And niggas stay down the streets from they grandmamas
Hoppin with the 3450 poppin in they palm cause
That's how it goes, that's how it's gon' stay
Rather toasty, there's nothin like my day, you don't say
I remember me, Snupe, the nucca Tour√©
Off them 40's ready for the drunken foray
With anyone who'd test, but let me tell ya somethin though, mane
All that funkin got us nothin but lumps and no pay
Now my only lumps is sums and the funk, it just hums
Out your hi-phonic ( ? ) system is stupid dumb
A hint of wisdom come, each second you grow
Some worth rememberin, some shit you wish you didn't know
Like this: don't trust your bitch
Cause she's here with me, just a skip
To the ( ? ) and busters skip

[ Pep Love ]
Oh okay
I like that but uhm
Hey, what was you talkin, what you talkin 'bout?

[ A-Plus ]
Hold up, I wanna explain - you wack and shit
You lack the gift, I wanna smack you, kid
Because the fact you did
An unforgivable crime wantin to rhyme
Against the smooth master
I move faster (my crew will blast ya)
And I bet you die you gets no ICU
Don't even entertain the thought that I'd be through slicin you
See a nigga like me construct lines to buck minds
(You can't corrupt mines)
I'm givin these niggas tough times
I'm above crimes
With "I don't give a fuck" rhymes
Niggas love mine
MC's see me as unkind
With they dumb rhymes
I confine and trap wack, leave 'em standin frozen
People say: A-Plus, that man is chosen
I'm the man with hoes and
Cash fast, to catch you dozin
There's no gimmicks, no ego trippin
No backwards flows and
There's no fuckin whistle
Souls of Mischief is destruction
Easily rupture facial tissue
Hieroglyphics, never late to diss you

[ Pep Love ]
Yeah
That just about sums it up
We comin from the West Coast, right?
But right about now it's a Oakland thing
And niggas just basically resurrect the bump
Bring it from wherever it ever came from
You know what I'm sayin?
It's that Hieroglyphics shit
How we do

Yeah yeah
And you know
We got hoes
Big bill folds
That's how it goes
Everybody knows
Goddamnit</pre>
