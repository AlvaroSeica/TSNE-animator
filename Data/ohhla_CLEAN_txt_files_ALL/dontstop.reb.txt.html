[Pharrell]
Uh, what?
Explain yourself, how you sound like me?
The motherfucking Skateboard P
Knowing that you're me low, playing games like you're Cee-Lo
in a tight situation like speedos
You can have it your way like Carlito
My nigga will be happy to give you torpedos
and have you car twisted like a blunt
For you faggot-ass niggas that like to front
I'm on some BBC Bape shit, I'm on some cake shit
In the kitchen with the heat making beats in my apron
You hating and you want to erase it
Close your eyes when you know you can't take it
My flow interrupts your homeostasis
I Rolls Royce it on a regular basis
You talk street shit, it sound like sweet shit
Straight liquorice, you niggas sound ticklish
Eighty K large for the Hermes dream
Purple Croton all your magazines
Hunger strike yourself, look like Celine
Dion, me and my niggas like Freon
Your bitch is on my pecan, she got an ass you can eat on
Try to play tough like the leather on a Vuitton
I hit it till I could seat on
Try to get her freak on
Ask me to R. Kelly ya and get peed on
I said it ain't me mom
That eight behind me still got the burner
Yes the Enzo is still black like Sojourner
Truth, I might have just loosened a tooth
Spitting what I live in the booth
I'm out, poof~!

[Lupe Fiasco]
Carrera, raised in the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle era
Wanna bear and tell the truth? I dare ya
You'll lie, so eat this whole powder with these jalapeno peppers
The terror made in America, 2 Live
Fuck the property or give me my props properly
High off life, this high-tecmology, DeVry
Now, rep Muhammad Ali, more like rapology
My policy's not to be dishonestly deprived
So gimme that, gimme that, keep God, where my city at?
I'm like steak and fries, but never died
They wanna Ghostface Wallabee me
but they will posthaste follow me into the after life
That means you going right after I've
But I'm the hero, sorta like Jack Sparrow
So someway, somehow, I have survived
Ha, ha, surprise
Who is he that we see coming over the tides
in a speed boat, boatload of pride?
Fall of rum, dress-shirted and the mastermind tie
He what happens when rapping and avant-garde fashion collide
So OMG it's the C from the C-R-S
L-O-L-ing at you haters, tell your BFFs like

[Kanye West]
Yes, Mr. West, turn that new child rebel
Loud as a badass child level
Who need a chorus? We do it Tyrannosaurus
Tyrone, it's been a year with no phone
Could you explain how high is your zone?
We'll take a plane, rub his nose in cocaine
His hoes in magazines, you lames stay in your lane
And for the hate in advance, pull down your pants
Make 'em kiss both cheeks like we living in France
Diamonds bluish, business manager's Jewish
And if I get sued, my lawyers Jews
Some girls do grab the cojones
Say you got enough diamonds to at least Sierra +loan+ us
Brand new ferraris, I gotta make the donuts
C-R-S is like a Hip Hop Christmas bonus
Niggas is hating on the internet, I couldn't tell
I was too busy rapping, good as hell
I was too busy flying, parasail
Get Talib to get the new shit that Paris sell
Tarantino, Da Vinci, getting Benjies
Get half off at Fendi, half of that's to Cindy's
Hopped out the spaceship, put my Mork in Mindy
Popped too many corks to let you dorks offend me
Props to New York, but Chi-town's the city
Get my groupie hoochies Gucci, Monica Belluccis
Are those the real millionnaires or the bendies?
I'm so ultra, I'm even over Oprah
Well, let me check your account, ha, ha, no sir</pre>
