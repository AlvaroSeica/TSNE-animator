[J Dilla]
(C'mon, c'mon feel the noise!)
Ruff Draft (girls grab the boys)
Uhh (get wild, wild wild)
Get wild (get wild, wild wild) get wild

Turn it up, another world premier y'all
Let's wild out in here front to rear y'all
Yeah, pimp juice 'bout to tear off
in these niggaz asses indeed it's a classic
We 'bout to get wild homeskillet
Long as hoes feel it, fuck the clones stealin
Where the fifthy, what's a fo'-wheel?
Don't just be talkin show deal
We wildin like "Girls Gone Wild" here
Stand up like D kings wild here
Stay stylin, pilin paper
Take over town like ice and Jacob, uhh
Treat haters like dice and shake 'em up
AJ Production, takin up
Back to what we came to do now
Get wild in here blaze the roof down

[Chorus]
C'mon (feel the noise!)
(Girls grab the boys)
(Get wild, wild wild) get wild
(Get wild, wild wild) get wild

[J Dilla]
Get wild on the Rampage, "Wild for the Night"
Get it lifted like Winona Ryder
Same energy that made Ike wanna fight her
Hos-tile, end up in hos-pi-tal
Fuck with this not an option yo
Might be too wild here in De-toire
Here to shut shit down, keep your day jobs
Yeah, the S. Vil, the MC
Free, Guilty, Reem and Rasheed
It's not a game my peeps got cheese
Freaks see us, get knock-kneed
tryin to hook off with us, everywhere we look up
Keep a nigga shook up, now you know this
All real playboy straight to Morpheus
Back to what we came to do now
Get it wild in here blaze the roof down
C'mon, feel the noise
Girls, grab the boys
And get wild (wild wild)
(Get wild, wild wild)

[Outro]
Wild out y'all, yeah
Uhh, hut one, hut two
Hut, hut, hut, hut (yeah)
Hut, hut, hut, hut (Ruff Draft)
Hut, hut, hoeeeee
Hut, hut, hut

(Okay that's the end of my slave song)</pre>
