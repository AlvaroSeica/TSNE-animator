[Intro: Mike Jones]
I lost my house, lost my car
But it's one thing I know I ain't lost baby
And that's you, I know that

[Intro: Trey Songz]
I know - I know, ohh
I know - (Mike Jones) baby girl
I know - if I wasn't a superstar
Rollin in fancy cars, you'd still be wit'cha boy
I know - you'd still be with Songz baby
I know - and that boy Mike Jones - baby girl
I know - if I wasn't a superstar
Rollin in fancy cars, you'd still be wit'cha boy

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
I know - wit'chu I'll never be alone
I know - that you would never do me wrong
I know - if I wasn't a superstar
Rollin in fancy cars, you'd still be wit'cha boy
I know - wit'chu I'll never be alone
I know - that you would never do me wrong
I know - if I wasn't a superstar
Rollin in fancy cars, you'd still be wit'cha boy

[Mike Jones] + (Trey Songz)
You ain't gotta tell me twice (I already know)
You was here when fame came and gon' be here (when fame go)
And I know you know that I'll take you around the world
And I know that you ain't trippin on them other girls
(I know) befo' my deal and my grill baby
(I know) you kept it real, kept it trill baby
(I know) if I lose everythang
Money cars and fame, my baby girl won't change, I said
(I know) through the thick and the thin baby
(I know) more than a lover she my friend baby
(I know) if I lose my house
She gon' be right there with me sleepin out on the couch, I said
(I know) if I lose my house
She gon' be right there with me sleepin out on the couch, I said
(I know - if I lose my house)
(You gon' be right there with me sleepin out on the couch girl I know)

[Chorus]

[Mike Jones] + (Trey Songz)
She ain't trippin 'bout money, she ain't trippin 'bout cars
Cause if I lose everythang she here wit'cha boy
A down-ass chick, don't care about the shine
She'll pass it all up just to spend some time
Love to wine and dine, she all over me
Everytime she know I'll leave she get close to me
My girl don't care about no money or no foreign whips
She'd rather stay at home forget takin them long trips
I'm with her every night, I hug her squeeze her tight
I was blind at one time but now I see the light
I'm with her every night, I hug her squeeze her tight
I was blind at one time but now I see the light
Call her my baby girl, som'n like my tenderoni
Befo' the fame came, my girl was all on me
Call her my baby girl, som'n like my tenderoni
Cause she was here when I was lonely

[Chorus]

[Trey Songz]
Ya boy-oiii
Ya boy-oiii
Ya boy-oiii
You'd still be wit'cha boy
SONGZ~!
You'd still be with me baby, YAH!</pre>
