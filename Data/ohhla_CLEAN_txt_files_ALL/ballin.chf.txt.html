Typed by: AZ Lyrics

GBE baby Sosa baby
Ballin', ballin', ballin', ballin'

[Chorus]
Bad bitches keep callin'
I swear this money keep fallin'
I bet it's this bitch callin'
I don't even wanna start in
Cause I'm ballin'
Bitch I'm ballin'

[Verse 1: Chief Keef]
Rollin' up this dope
Pop a nigga something like crisco
All I do is spend dough
I don't even know this bitch no mo'
Cause I'm ballin'
So please bitch stop callin'
Bitch I'm Chief Keef
Every bitch know me
If the bitch don't know me
Let me tell you hoes bout me
Bitch I'm ballin'
And we shoot no talkin'
Rockin' in my pink dolphin
Finna pop me a blue dolphin
Broke ass niggas who talkin'
If you ain't talkin' money than you thru talkin'
Bitch I'm ballin'
On these broke niggas, I'm ballin'
Ballin', ballin'

[Chorus]
Bad bitches keep callin'
I swear this money keep fallin'
My best friends have been stallin'
I don't even wanna start in
Cause I'm ballin'
Bitch I'm ballin'
Sippin' on that lean
I go hard for my team
Pockets filled with that green
I just blow it all on my team
Cause I'm ballin'
Nigga I'm ballin'

[Verse 2: Chief Keef]
Ride around with my 3 hunnas
All my niggas, we stuntin'
Spendin commas, bitch it's nothin'
And I'm eatin, got me a big stomach
Cause I'm ballin'
I'm ballin', I'm ballin'
I be countin' them stacks
Crackin' cards, get back
I gets me a big check
And everything designer but it's mismatch
Cause I'm ballin'
I'm ballin' like spaldin'
Trus off my ass
Pockets filled with that cash
Niggas see me, they mad
Bitches see me, they pants I'm in fallin'
Now I'm thru talkin'
Cause I'm ballin', I'm ballin'

[Chorus]
Bad bitches keep callin'
I swear this money keep fallin'
My best friends have been stallin'
I don't even wanna start in
Cause I'm ballin'
Bitch I'm ballin'
Sippin on that lean
I go hard for my team
Pockets filled with that green
I just blow it all on my team
Cause I'm ballin'
Nigga I'm ballin'</pre>
