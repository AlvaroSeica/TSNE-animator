[Chorus: Popa Chief]
Always expects the unexpected
Be prepared when shit gets hectic
You don't know how long you got on this planet
So don't take your one life for granted
Always expects the unexpected
Be prepared when shit gets hectic
Popa Chief, just what the doctor ordered
You niggas fit to steal, and percent they get murdered
Message!!!!

[Popa Chief]
It all starts from toy guns that got bang and squirts
And the violence on the Cartoon Network
Yosemite Sam and Elmer Fudd, role models
Busting shots in bars, swiggin' on triple X bottles
Wile E. Coyote, always getting fucked up
Tell me, is it rabbit season or is it 'duck'?
I thought rap was a trade, to sit back and get paid
In the shade, lamping, sippin' on lemonade
Oh, I'm afraid, that it's worse than the spread of AIDS
Niggas lounge today, pack AK's and hand grenades
Chasing rusty blades, but I'm afraid
That my seed might be the next one, when the bullets stray
If I hear one more mafioso rap, I'mma lose it
If I hear one more high body count rap, I'mma lose it
If I hear one more gang bang east/west coast rap, I'mma lose it
Stop it, no, put an end... I got to fix it, message

[Chorus]

[Popa Chief]
Born the son of a Mayan worker, pistol packing poolander
My song it dances to tear jerks
Prince taught me how to weak an a-plus cusser
Experimenting with cannibus and firewater
Moms did the best she could, knock on wood
Had her growing up in the hood, so poor, feel so good
Babysitter had me licking twat as a kid
Clap the maniac, no remorse for the shit I did
Pops was a rolling stone, I was born grown
Nine-ten, and I still live at home
Cuz ain't nobody giving me shit, ain't nothing free
On the verge of prosperity, living in poverty
Young dumb and widen, seven days on Riker's Island
Three seeds, two baby mommas, nobody smiling
I found out, what I did not know
Frozen, H20, don't flow...
Oh now I know, message

[Chorus]</pre>
