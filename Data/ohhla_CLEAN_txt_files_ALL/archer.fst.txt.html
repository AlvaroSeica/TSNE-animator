[sample]
A snake charmer? Your best work yet
However this next job will not be so easy
Zen Yi has become a thorn in the lion's paw
This is what happens when you send a bitch to do a man's job

[Intro: Killa Sin]
One-two, one-two, yes sir, turn me all the way the fuck up
Let's go, yeah, Killa Sin just came home
Shout outs to The RZA, my physical Power Cypher, love you boy

[Killa Sin]
Yo, they call me the drama starter, heart stopper, llama popper, I gotcha
Gangsta impostors, calling the coppers, and ducking the rockets
Optic, digging my pocket, cock it, empty your block, bitch, you hear me?
The semi toxic, like, Remy that's rock less
Have you swiveled up and shot, said, no screaming, I'm shot, shit
Like Pusha T and Malice, muthafucka, I got clips
And shells that'll lock lips for kicking that Pac shit
Then slam through your body like they stuck in the mosh pit
A born again, rebel in the flesh, do it to the death
Bleed heat, meaning I won't rest, til I'm fluid less
Niggas be like 'yo, you the best', nah, I'm just one of them
These faggot ass rappers be running, like I pulled the gun at them
Call me daddy, I'm sunning them, bad, burnt badly
Sign suckers up for Gangsta Academy, so they mad at me
A g checker, reject quick, demand my respect
Like D-Set, made bird niggas dip, I clear your p-jects
Yeah, your boy sweet techs, not steps, head shot
See neck, knees, chest, long as them bullets meet flesh
You subpoena to meet death, Killa did it and beat death
I dance with the devil, right now I'm letting my feet rest
Talk a tough, go bonkers or bust in a monstrous conquerors crush
Comp to dust, fuck a niggas sponsors up
Diamond cut rhyming in my prime, blind a miner
Steady digging in my styles for one liners, none finer
Ensign a compromise, word bond and brothers honor mine
Sorta like spans, like Father Time, hard to find
Another artist that go hard as I, and I got a heart divine
Read niggas like march of dime rappers, don't get shot for trying
Everybody wanna shine, my fire one of a kind
Inspire brothers to rhyme, soon as I utter a line
Gun ho, Mighty Joe Young blow, gorilla bars
Killa far from a corner, dying amongst the realest stars
Known for giving niggas scars, goon work, my wombs search in twos
Inserted in your private parts, you can die tomorrow
Better yet today, you better pray for better ways to get away
When my Beretta spray, I'm known for giving lead away
Young fuckers the head of gray, here's man, I swear
I can send you to a better place, where nobody can set a trace
And tears for you cheers, throw your hands til your shots fired
And rot in peace til ya'll police lovers rocking wires</pre>
