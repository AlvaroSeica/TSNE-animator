[Intro: Solomon Childs w/ Suga Bang Bang ad-lbs]
It's over, yeah, I told ya
I'm running, adolescent life
They say we out here living
We really out here dying though
So I'mma talk to 'em

[Chorus 2X: Suga Bang Bang]
I grew up in these streets with some lions and gorillas
Grew up with some pimps and some pushers
So I'm gonna bang, the way I bang
Somebody should of told you that the game is over

[Solomon Childs]
From Brooklyn to Bronx to Staten
Infered with the ultra vision, street life murder
Able to play any position, so what his body cold
Don't stop filling his ass with lead
Til his nerves start kicking, stomp one of these niggas out
Who claim they got position, music for the rookie
Think the drill sergeant got a big mouth
And if it wasn't for the love of the team, they wouldn't put him on his ass
Put his kid in a headlock, toast in his mouth
My fault, I'm just a hood nigga
A almost'll do anything for the money nigga
Able to hit the slant or the way I feel
Bygones, whenever be bygones
Feel good to laugh now, but had the same spirit later
When  you cry later, bye hater, die hater
I'm much greater, new paper

[Chorus 2X]

[Solomon Childs]
It's over, I told ya, I'm running, yeah
Coming to live, satellite, pay attention
It ain't just every day you see a shooting star
Still know 2 to 3 killas out of Grasmere
In tinted cars, I'm from the borough of Dryer
Galo and Dupri, chasing niggas through the p's
Cuz of the rapping shotty, or the way niggas will chase them knotts
Better than plastic glocks
Nowadays, I'm running lights, riding dirty, playing that Maino
Surviving cuz the hoods are like Halo
I love hip hop but this getting dealt for them pesos
Still breathing in this rain forest
Full pocket, never designed in them range rover
Color, two-toned, surrounded by divas
Praying that I take 'em home
It's like your wifey's on my iPhone
Kayslay, I know you hear me through your headphone
Watch the world have it's ringtone

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
