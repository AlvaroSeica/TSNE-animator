[Hodgy Beats]
Pour my lyrics in your cup, it's glass warmin
Roll up six dutches, yo I got a half on me
I'm like a dinosaur, spikes in my back bony
When I get out the streets, I ain't goin back
Homie real mo', know it's real in the battlefield
Money first, beef last, I could make the cattle yield
It's been so hard for me, I can't conclude how to feel
Bring the snakes in the grass to the cage if they rattle, kill
I'm competitive, beatin you competitors
No time to settle in, my focus is irregular
Approach the game steppin up, stand my ground set it up
I'm an Odd character, someone you've never met before
See me through your eyes, you see me through the skies
Even Left Brain and Ace Creator splittin beef pie
We high, almost like we fly cause we fly
We run L.A., watch me speed by

[Chorus]
I rock-rock roll over, rock-rock roll over
Rock-rock like a rolling stone
Uhh, rock-rock roll over, rock-rock roll over
Rock-rock like a rolling stone, yeah
Rock roll rock roll rock rock (yeah)
Rock roll rock roll rock rock (uh-huh)
I rock-rock roll over, rock-rock roll over
Rock-rock like a rolling stone

[Hodgy Beats]
Knock knock, the block's hot, the cops out
Rolling, Rock-rock, my cock's out
And can you take it, guess where I lunge out
when you step into the ring and get their lines punched out
I must be fed, can't eat with a closed mouth
Can't make it home if you sleepin in the hoe's house
Eating all the hoe food, slouchin on the hoe couch
She 'bout the trickin, you know what them hoes about
When she see you in the Benz, she gon' go and tell her friends
Now her friends fuckin with you cause they want to get it in
If she come up on yo' cash, they gon' split it in thirds
They dig so deep in your pockets you can't put it in words
I don't receive pleasure off of heffers goin after my cheddar
Attitude is whatever for ever twenty more pleather
I got a "fuck 'em all" tee, with a fuck 'em all gesture
And I don't give - NEVER

[Chorus]
