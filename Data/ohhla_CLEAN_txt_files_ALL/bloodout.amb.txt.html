Watching you with red eyes (Walk through the wire)
Follow you through lifetimes (Never expire)
Without fear we face them (We stand together)
Blood out, blood out.(We stand forever)

Once you're inside
There's no outside

Watching you with red eyes (Walk through the wire)
Follow you through lifetimes (Never expire)
Without fear we face them (We stand together)
Blood out, blood out.(We stand forever) {*5X*}
