[Shawn Wigs]
Uh-huh, I get around, ask 2Pac, I get down
For the grit, got your girl grinding and shit
While I'm pulling up the back of my pants, ya'll plain
Unlike me, I keep the gucci checks on the Nikes
In a raisin bread six, champagne burgundy
Pressure, I force MC's just like Mercury
A natural born, I ain't making New York ugly
Or dirty, I'm fresh like a Jordan jersey
The rap wizard, bang on the door, they like damn, son
Who is it? It's Wigs from the W.B.
What you want? To put a fucking crush on the industry
I'm satisfying, ask your wiz, she call me Snickers
In my whip, your shit, got a rear full of bumper stickers
"Honk if you're horny" or "ride til you die"
You a cornflake nigga, I'mma ride right by
With the hydro burning, grandma yae
Twenty inch rims on the C.L.K.
I'm a bad mutha flower-flower, to the third power
Went legit, took my money in the shower
I washed it, put it on the grill and I flipped it
First day, my album hit stores, ya'll go ballistic</pre>
