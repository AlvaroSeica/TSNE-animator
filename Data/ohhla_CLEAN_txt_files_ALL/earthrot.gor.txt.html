[Verse 1]
Young mutants, student survivors, embedded the earth
The after birth of radiation came and deaded the church
UFO roamin' the turf for text experiments
Medical breakthrough, stomp my day with a shake of sedatives
C.I.A., brain implants, connected intelligence
Underground cities committed, infested with pestilence
Tri-lateral's actual facts protected with medicine
Closed sectors, we manifest food for the wounded veterans
Constitution suspended, diseases growin' on leaves
Panic attacks, the ozone close so we don't breath
Fuck this faggots, they feeble and I ain't givin' them props
Fuck the nazi, Illuminati and Mel Gibson's pops
Rockin' BZ, chemical agents Kill Switch Engage
The newest nerve gas since aerosol injected and sprayed
The hottest craze, my hatred, I'm the Shaman of pain
The greatest meltdown, pass the cloud, scowl and rain

[Hook]
The revolution won't be televised, we watch the plague
The All in the sky, it turns red and burst into flames
Death is certain, life's not, unstoppable pain
It's earth rot, the beginning of the end, the last frame

[Verse 2]
It's game over, justice got stuck with the wind blown
The fuckin' president, will never dig us out of this shit-hole
200 billions dollars, Osama still eats and breathes
Suicide mind for six in the cuff, flashin' on undergreens
The duffel bag smashes all block to fuckin' smithereens
Another blackout, they cracked the blueprint from the Philippines
I knew in '93 that they'll be back for second
I never slept right, instead I ??? off for track records
Loopin' footage, I assume the hitted the same
I presume they will make a move, but they were slick with the place
A new face been raised and trained down in the Florida's sun
Tons of human flesh carressin' each other before they took the plunge
They put fear in my heart, but we was out to lunch
Reckon women, fathers, sisters, mother and sons
Teen martyrs, Allah told 'em to get us in 0-10
Under the sun, nuclear holocaust, it's the final end
