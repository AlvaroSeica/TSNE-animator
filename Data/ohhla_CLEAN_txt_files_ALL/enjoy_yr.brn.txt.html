[Grand Puba]
Uhh, uhh, uhh, uhh
Uhh, yeah, it's like this, it's like that huh?
A yeah yeah, a what what? A here we go now
A c'mon c'mon, keep it finger poppin now
Because it's time for you to
("Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself with me")
("Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself, ENJOY yourself with me")
("C'mon ENJOY yourself - enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself")
A here we go now, a here we go now
("ENJOY yourself - enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself")
Uh-huh, now here we go now, a here we go now

[Sadat X]
I'ma enjoy myself cause I'm here
Cause my classmate tally gets smaller every year
How many cats I've known that got smashed
How many chicks I've known that live like trash
I might be Son but I'm never out son, the gun
No woman should be shunned if she can upkeep and maintain
and crane keep her body tight, and that ass tight
And her mind right, this ain't minister's life
but I'm polite, I'm not the greatest dancer
But I can rub up on that frame and throw that name brand shit on the floor
Polo, designer names with them funny accents
Throw the dick to the body in the red Corvette like sprint{?}
Enjoy yo'self and enjoy your health
is what I tell them burly bouncer niggaz
that be actin off the strength that they big (yo back up big boy)
I represent the skinny man with the snub outside of the club

[Chorus]
("Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself with me")
("Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself, ENJOY yourself with me")
("C'mon ENJOY yourself - enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself")
A here we go now, a here we go now
("ENJOY yourself - enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself")
Yeah, a here we go now, a here we go now, uhh

[Lord Jamar]
Now what'chu come for?
If you ain't gettin on the floor, sweat until it pour
I thought you come to have a good time
Hear some cats that really could rhyme
Stood on the line, and paid
Now I think it's time that you played
Why you wanna throw shade
in the direction of your own complexion
Causin static like a real bad phone connection
You can take that shit home, I'ma make that shit known
If you wanna push it further, I'ma break that kid's bones
Uhh, we tryin to get our party on
And can't nobody fuck it up, bartender line 'em up
Any future stars we gonna sign 'em up
Lord Jamar, the producer of your finer cuts
We make 'em loose and make the honies wanna wind they butts
And reproduce just like a gang truce
Everybody dancin in the same boots
We all come from the same roots, what?

[Chorus]

[Grand Puba]
("Let's have some fun") uh-huh
("Let's have a good time, you and me") yeah yeah YEAH~!
Move out the way it's Brand Nu's turn to shine
Hurt emcees, grab the pine, and get paid no never mind
One time as we sew it up like Dr. Frankenstein
Chickens ride the +Pony+ cause the rhyme flow +Ginuwine+
As we do it like that, do it like this
Shorty watch yo' step or you might get +Rocked+ like +Chris+
Are you feelin this? You dig the way it's goin down
Now we back in town, watch all the chickens crowd around
Niggaz try to duplicate our flow but it's difficult
Like a game of Yahtzee, chickens stress me out like paparazzi
Sometimes I flip a flow you desire
How we blaze those trees and the {?} focus fire
My rhymes carry like the weight on Barry
Stack cheddar like +Holmes+ and buy homes like +Larry+
Be smoother than towel, plus +Sharp+ like +Al+
When you ballin everybody wanna be yo' pal, uhh
No dilly-dally, baggin up the shorter Halle
Bouncin in German cars, still playin Shark Bar
Brand Nubian cats, here to make you have a ball
If you don't rock to this, you don't rock at all!

[Chorus] w/ ad libs</pre>
