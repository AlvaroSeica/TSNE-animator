"Hate the price of fame 'coz it cost too much" (yeah boy)
"And you lame niggaz talk too much" (yeah)
"I'm ready for whatever, somebody better tell 'em" (yeah boy)
"I said I'm ready for whatever, hey hey"
 
[Verse 1]
Even though my head in the clouds, my planet on the pavement
How I'm walkin around, people stand and amaze me
And I play a lot of game on where I be and I ain't playin with it
They so judgmental, everyday they don't understand
If your life was in jeopardy, e'ryday is you tellin me
You wouldn't need weaponry just because of your felony
Consider this at least, I got e'rybody sweatin me
On the streets is people who won't rest unless I rest in peace
Killed my folk a year ago, still in my sleep they threaten me
Paranoia stressin me, ain't nobody protectin me
I'm dealin with the pressure from my partner dyin next to me
No one's arrested, they comin for me eventually
This was all the things I was goin through mentally
This could be the reason I ignored the penitentiary
Now mention them New Orlean niggaz comin in the city
Killin all summer long, ain't nobody payin attention
 
[Interlude]
Now is it that hard to understand if you listen
Either die or go to jail, that's a hell of a decision
But how wrong can I do if my excuses ain't important
I'm just tryna let you know that I ain't think I had a choice
 
[Chorus]
I had straps in my ride, gotta go to prison
You ain't no need to die, you gon' be waitin for 'em (you ready boy)
Ready for whatever, somebody better tell 'em
I be here when the smoke clears and everythin settles, for real
Can't afford the price of fame 'coz it cost too much
Plus these sucka niggaz lame and they talk too much
Ready for whatever, somebody better tell 'em
I be here when the smoke clears and everythin settles, for real
 
[repeat + ad-libs]
For real
 
[Verse 2]
I'm a man, I ain't perfect, gotta admit it I'm guilty
But understand, feel me how I ride filthy
'Coz niggaz out there plot to rob me and kill me
500 thousand every year spent on security
And my future walk bright, but now it's gettin blurry
'Coz niggaz in the air ready to find me and bury me
But surely, God will deliver me up out it
I'm a fighter to the heart and I forever be about it
I'm a father to my sons, and sit to my community
Look at all that I done, my good weigh the negativity
Mentally, I was focused on not lettin history
repeat itself, that's why he kept that for insanity
"Yes officially I broke the law but not maliciously"
Through all of the publicity, was anybody considerin
My position and the logic came from my decision
"But they caught me with it, now I'm off to prison, period"
 
[Interlude]
But is it that hard to understand if you listen
Either die or go to jail, that's a hell of a decision
But how wrong can I do if my excuses ain't important
I'm just tryna let you know that I ain't think I had a choice
 
[Chorus]
 
[repeat + ad-libs]
For real
