(chorus)
Why niggaz be on why niggaz be on why niggaz be on our jock (6x)

(Black C)
Oh shit should this be another fuckin hit
(Why niggaz be on why niggaz be on why niggaz be on your dick)
I don't know I think it's just the flow
Or maybe it's the way I use my game to peel a ho
See I'm a nigga with some game ain't nothin changed
Shootin this shit like a shootin range
I think my name should be Mike
Cuz I'm every fuckin playa-hatin nigga wanna be like
But that icky-green sticky it get me
Higher than a mothafucka so they can't get with me
See I stay posted gettin toasted
Game ferocious down to a bitch gettin roasted
It's kinda simple and it's easy
Watchin these jealous mothafuckas get mad cuz their bitch skees me
And I know they talkin shit
But I got nuts for a nigga, and dick for a bitch

chorus (8x)

(Mr. Cee)
This is goin out to the people in my business
You ain't toilet paper so stay out the shitness
And watch me come on like a shirt
If you'z a man with sensitivity you'z about to get your feelings hurt
I'm not tryin to say I'm all that
But just call me dope cuz niggaz constantly got a grip on my sac
And when I'm in their face yes I'm they nigga
But really I'm that nigga they wanna get rid of
And if a bitch around watch them perp
Niggaz start claimin my name just like a turf
But this is the hard rugid and dangerous
And peace to my niggaz that claim this shit
But let me open my pants cuz I feel somethin rubbin
So many people on my dick that now they jock my belly-button
So if your head turn when I hit the block
Just consider yourself one of them niggaz on my jock
