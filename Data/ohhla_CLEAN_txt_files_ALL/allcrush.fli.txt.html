Intro (Bender)

All night I daydream of sleep but never get it
Forgot my house key drinkin' on the stoop with Charles Bukowski
Right it down to spread my message like an epidemic
In my best attempt to convince the world it's lost without me

Verse one (Bender)

Yo, the pavement boils I'm sweatin' rock salt in gridlock
While cops just watch and regulate the dealers like a pitboss
And nowadays I watch through Hitchcock's lense
Right down the drain and move on tourists rockin' giftshop threads
Vacation's over, say hello to the, alright look
I never claimed that I was more than just a small time crook
For pocket change but I ain't really trying to play with these boys
They talk a good one in the booth but got no pain in their voice, for real
And anyone that don't feel it can suck my titty
Government city all-star, son 'em so none forget me
Sullen and sluggish, 'nuff of us suffered a troubled history
But muster some love to crumble up, brother, come 'bun it with me now
Them snipers never catch the whites of my eyes
Stayin' bloodshot from the bends holdin' a nitrogen high
A knife in my side, spend my Februarys in a slump
Respected as a writer, legendary as a drunk
Chorus (Bender [&amp; Patience])
All night I daydream of sleep [but never get it]
Forgot my house key drinkin' on the stoop with Charles Bukowski
[Right it down to spread my message like an epidemic]
In my best attempt to convince the world it's lost without me
Repeat

Verse two (Patience)

His debut out The Royal was the same as the gates were crossed initially
Carry me no longer, wrong or right I'll change the history
It's a mystery, the gist is enough
And admittedly I was different then but I give it as much still
Smack the SM-58 from his clutch
Broaden my involvement the talk I paint with this brush
And publish this poetry or prose I wrote with the hopes
That it comes back as plastic I consider as dope
I've got a sneer and Roman nose, thoughts are doublin'
Never gullible, she scream when she comin' in multiples
That's your trouble, duke
With concertina wire, muscle tongue speak
Dippin' in &amp; out of morose to mania - that's the steez
So if you see me at your jam buggin', consider it luck
'cause I'm arbitratily nasty from the pit of my gut
Was livin' it up when I was younger now I structure it more
Give me a dap or say 'What up' if I'm drunk on your floor and pick me up...

Repeat chorus
