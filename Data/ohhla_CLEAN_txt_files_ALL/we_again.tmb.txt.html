[Lil' Man] (Timbaland)
Bounce!
Get crunk, get crunk, get crunk (Ladies)
Bounce wit' me, bounce wit' me (Fellas, uh, uh)
Get crunk, get crunk, get crunk (Now ladies)
Bounce wit' me, bounce wit' me (Freaky fellas, ah)
Get crunk, get crunk, get crunk (Now ladies)
Bounce wit' me, bounce wit' me (Freaky fellas)
Get crunk, get crunk, get crunk (Freaky, freaky now ladies)
Freaky, freaky, freaky

[Timbaland]
Timbaland never walk in a place
He can't walk out of
Gettin' rude in the place
With a gun in my waist
I just might pop out slugs
With a straight arm
Bullets stomp through your Phat Farm till the animals jump out of
No justifications
While my song question like that Jigga What?
I'm the cause that the thugs gon' fight
In the club so tight, y'all KY'd up
Sometimes I fall, on cars I just hop right up
With the drop top and the top dropped
And your mouth drops like
"WHAT THE {FUCK?}"
Only deal with conjunction chicks
When I'm looking to hit
They give me butt
Now who da man, say Timbaland!

[Static](Lil' Man)
Now off the top, off the top
(We at it again)
From the candy store to the coffee shop
(We at it again)
To your girl next door, to your boy next door
(We at it again)
To the one's at the club
To the people on the floor
(We at it again)
Hit in one mo' gin
Now say off the top, off the top
(We at it again)
From the candy store to the coffee shop
(We at it again)
To your girl next door, to your boy next door
(We at it again)
To the people at the club
To the one's on the floor
(We at it again, at it again)

[Magoo]
Yeah gettin' a couple of you hoes
Gotta {dick} by the size of the elbow
Don't scream with it hurt
I'm a {fucking} machine
Fiend for cash, fiend for hash
Ginseng make it last
Push on her in the butt
Not giving a nigga love
Press your luck, ready to buck
I'm a bad {motherfucker} when it comes to the show
{Fuck} y'all don't hate Mag hate the flows
Two in the clip ready to pimp
I'm a bad {motherfucker} and I'm ready to trip
Y'all scared {motherfucker} y'all ready to dip
But you niggas keep wanting to slip
Then a fool like me come out with a thang on the hip
Get back in our ride, legs are up in your driver side
Those seats lookin' like you better be ready to hide
One in your leg, two in your side

[Static(?)](Lil' Man)
Now off the top, off the top
(We at it again)
From the candy store to the coffee shop
(We at it again)
To your girl next door, to your boy next door
(We at it again)
To the one's at the club
To the people on the floor
(We at it again)
Hit in one mo' gin
Now say off the top, off the top
(We at it again)
From the candy store to the coffee shop
(We at it again)
To your girl next door, to your boy next door
(We at it again)
To the people at the club
To the one's on the floor
(We at it again, at it again)

[Sebastian]
Uh, Sebastian never play niggas
I fuckin' just trade me some niggas
Fuck up my brain when she steady giving me brain in the whip
Never hit just ball legit
Give her diamonds so big she can't ball up her fist
With designers so big shirts crop at the wrist
Look at some of the shit that my dough can get
Whoo! Boy that's that shit!
That I be dippin' and poppin' the top and
These bitches ? and blockin'
These niggas lovin' the dough
My youngins lovin' the flow
South people back on the roll
Ladies get back on the floor
Fellas keep throwin' the bowls
This how a party should go

[Static](Lil' Man)
Now off the top, off the top
(We at it again)
From the candy store to the coffee shop
(We at it again)
To your girl next door, to your boy next door
(We at it again)
To the one's at the club
To the people on the floor
(We at it again)
Hit in one mo' gin
Now say off the top, off the top
(We at it again)
From the candy store to the coffee shop
(We at it again)
To your girl next door, to your boy next door
(We at it again)
To the people at the club
To the one's on the floor
(We at it again, at it again)</pre>
