Life a funny thing, we all wanna shine like diamond rings
Live like kings, and achieve childhood dreams
Lord be my witness when I say we all need you
Cause where I'm livin' ain't nothing but hustlin' gon' feed you
Many say the negativity shouldn't be glorified
Eyes wide when they realize a nigga live and die
The shit I speak, but don't nobody give a damn
Nigga hung up, on what I got and who I am
Save me, from this evilness that made me
Ain't nothin' shakin' if you ain't talkin' 'bout payin' me
The route to all evil don't seem bad
When dreams of havin' it is all I ever had

Nobody wants you when your down and out
Can't find, no one

He blessed me, oh yeah, you could say that
A Southern cat, puttin' Tennesee on the map
With rap, hip-hop until they pop me and my heart stop
Thinkin' 'bout the things I did to get me where I got
Are where I came from, ain't nothing easy about it
I got 'bout it, and got the fuck up out it
Crab ass niggaz wanna see me broke
Because I'm flippin' like a kingpin sellin' legal dope
Quote what I wrote, gettin' smoked with your guys
Hopin' I demise, I can see it in your eyes
The same nigga tryin' to smoke a sack with me
Be the same bitch talkin' 'bout jackin' me
That's when Ricardo called the killers and they always ready
Nightmares for your fam 'bout them bullets in your belly
Image is everything, and skill is twice that
And don't nobody want you when your ass is broke flat

Nobody wants you when your down and out
Can't find, no one
No one to turn to when your luck is up (where you gonna turn to?)
Can't find, no one (there's no one to turn to)

These streets, can be so mean to men
Crack and guns take dreams from men
In the blink of an eye, go from dusted to the rich
And watch how many people start ridin' your dick
Oh, you the man when your flippin' through the town on chrome
But who gon' really be your nigga when that bullshits gone?
Uh
You think it's funny, but ain't nobody laughin' but you
When I done seen what a broke ass nigga will do
Jack, sell crack to get they life on track
Some say I glorify, but all I do is tell the facts
I done seen garbage sacks full of hundred stacks
Rich cats lose it all fuckin' with P packs
People say make the money change things around you
And not you, but that's some hard shit to do
Remember this when your hustlin' and have doubts
Nobody want you, when a nigga ass out, uh

Nobody wants you when your down and out
Can't find, no one
No one to turn to when your luck is up (where you gonna turn to?)
Can't find, no one (there's no one to turn to)
Nobody wants you when your down and out
Can't find, no one
No one to turn to when your luck is up (where you gonna turn to?)
Can't find, no one (there's no one to turn to)
