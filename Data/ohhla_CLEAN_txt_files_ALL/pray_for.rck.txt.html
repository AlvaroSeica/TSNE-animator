[Intro]
What is this? {Maybach Music}
I like this Maybach Music
Let's wait {*laughter*}

[prayer]
Come on let's pray
Dear Lord, please forgive us for all the sins bein brought upon us
And look down upon us with forgiveness for all the sins we will have in the future
I know you understand that niggaz ain't perfect
But we try, Lord
We try to keep our heads up in bad times
This is a bad time
Show us the way
And if you can't show us the way
Then forgive us for bein lost
