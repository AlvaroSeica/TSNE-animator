Ain't that about a hoot
What you so mad about?
Them gawldamn city folks comin around these here hills
Lookin for a piece of that tender young ass, yaww
Let me tell you my Thelma Lou knows better than to
Give her puddin to anybody else but Pa 
Rappin to this bitch with a red neck
A red neck, them fuckin red neck
Rappin to this bitch with a red neck
Violent J gonna step to that red ass neck
Bitch you're a red neck 
But I gives a fuck I'm bout to step
I never met a southern belle cowpolk
And I know till now you've only fucked your kinfolk
Bitch I can't believe that 
Everytime you smile you look like Cactus Jack
Just cut the lights out 
Cause I still wanna bang that bearded biscuit out
Bitch I knows you's a freak
Lemme bitch slap that butt cheek
And try to keep your toothless mouth shut
And don't say shit you funky ass fat bitch
I don't square dance 
I drink monkey blood and kick voodoo chants
But you quick to act like you didn't know
Like you didn't know that I'm a juggalo gigalo
Biatch wait hold up (What?)
I can't have Pa starin at my butt
Tell him to leave and keep the barn doors closed 
All I need is him tryin to grope my nizzogs

(Chorus)
Bitch you's a hoe (Uh huh)
And hoe you's a bitch (That's right)
Everybody knows that you's a funky funky bitch (Come again y'all)
Bitch you's a hoe (Uh huh)
And hoe you's a bitch (That's right)
Everybody knows that you's a (What?) funky bitch 

(Chorus)
Rappin to this bitch with a red neck
A red neck, a chicken ass red neck
A bitch with a beard and a red neck
Hey yo Shaggy step to that red ass neck
Bitch it's Shaggs
Before I teabag your face take off them rags
You been chillin in the barn all night and day
Shovelin horse shit and fuckin with hay
Bitch it's your neden I'm finna tag
I don't give a fuck play your Ricky Skaggs
Yeah that's right fuck Conway Twitty
With your red ass nipple on your red neck titty
Bitch I'm rollin down south
With a swisher sweet hangin out my mouth
And sport a Hank Allen cowboy hat
But after I tap it, man fuck that
Bitch I'm from the big city
And I'm finna bust a nut on that one big titty
Aww shit it's Wilbur's daughter
Fondlin pig nuts and I caught her
Bitch drop them hog balls
She dropped the sack then dropped her drawers
She looked like a crow that's all I know
But I still fucked that red neck hoe

(Chorus)
Bitch you's a hoe (Uh huh)
And hoe you's a bitch (That's right)
Everybody knows that you's a funky funky bitch (Come again y'all)
Bitch you's a hoe (Uh huh)
And hoe you's a bitch (That's right)
Everybody knows that you's a (What?) funky bitch

(Chorus)
I know a red neck bitch named Wylita, straight stack
Biscuit in her pocket, nipples look like flap jacks
Chicken face bitch two or three good teeth
But if I ask for sugar she's a big fuzzy peach
Now I remember when she milked the cows
Sticks of hay in the mouth, ass hangin all out
Got me itchin on my balls, and I'm rubbin my wang
That damn there girl pretty did she need a twang 
Hey there Missy I'm from the East
And I wouldn't mind layin in the hay for a piece
You can rub my butt like you do your Pa's
Or I can hide my meat in between your jaws
And even hum a little sumthin sweet by Clint Black
While you stroke and caress my tender nut sac
You like it rough bitch don't you I'ma bring the pain
She said ain't that damn movie by John Wayne
Rappin to this bitch with a red neck
A red neck, a chicken ass red neck
A fat bubbly bitch with a red neck, turkey funky chicken neck
Bitch it's Twiztid with a Z
You red neck hoe is you fuckin with me?
Neden scabbed up like a horses ass
But I'ma tap it anyway and use your head for my nut rag
Bitch what the fuck?
Smells like a pile of dead fish in your butt
Your shirts all covered with pins and fishing tackle
And I saw more teeth on an apple
Bitch you better ask Uncle Gus
Or you and the rest of the Clampett's will get fucked up
Oh me? I talk to the spirits
Witches, demons, and they all keep screamin

(Chorus)
Bitch you's a hoe (Uh huh)
And hoe you's a bitch (That's right)
Everybody knows that you's a funky funky bitch (Come again y'all)
Bitch you's a hoe (Uh huh)
And hoe you's a bitch (That's right)
Everybody knows that you's a (What?) funky bitch 
Bitch you's a hoe (Uh huh)
And hoe you's a bitch (That's right)
Everybody knows that you's a funky funky bitch (Come again y'all)
Bitch you's a hoe (Uh huh)
And hoe you's a bitch (That's right)
Everybody knows that you's a funky funky bitch (Come again y'all)
Bitch you's a hoe (Uh huh)
And hoe you's a bitch (That's right)
Everybody knows that you's a (What?) funky bitch 

(Chorus x2)
Round up you boys
And you head down south
Find a red neck hoe and put your dick in her mouth</pre>
