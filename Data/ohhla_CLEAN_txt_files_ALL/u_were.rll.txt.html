Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Wiley]
I can tell you don't wanna come around cause
{You were always}
Trying to make yourself so busy and
{You were always}
Playing up, is this really gonna work cause
{You were always}
Trying to make him fancy you
{You were always}
Going on like you love me up and
{You were always}
Making him think you loved him up and
{You were always}
Making me think twice about you cause
{You were always}
Trying to make my head spin
{You were always}
Saying to me you're sure about this and
{You were always}
Sulking when you don't get your way and
{You were always}
Trying to catch me out so much and
{You were always}
Talking about your feelings were strong and
{You were always}
Making me think you're gonna do wrong
{You were always}
Trying to switch me off and on
{You were always}
Trying to know what I am on
{You were always}
Forgetting that what we are doing is wrong
{You were always}
Now we're...
{Smiling}
You see, now I'm...
{Smiling}
{Smiling}
But now we're...
{Smiling} [x2]

[Tinchy Stryder]
Trying to bring me down and
{You were always}
Telling me to do this telling me to do that
{You were always}
Trying to pretend you're busy for me
{You were always}
Telling me you love me, telling me you want me
{You were always}
Change your faults and blaming me
{You were always}
Spying cause you had no trust
{You were always}
That's when girl's say tinche's a must
{You were always}
Trying to present your move on...
{You were always}
Trying to keep your eye on me
{You were always}
Telling your friends you didn't care
{You were always}
Phoning telling me you care
{You were always}
Seeming to forget that I moved on
{You were always}
Trying to tell me I need you
{You were always}
Moaning, groaning, still not knowing
{You were always}
Bredding me and begging me
{You were always}
Pretending that it weren't over
{You were always}

[Dizzee Rascal]
We was tingzing time ago
{You were always}
Sweet at first but swiftly changed
{You were always}
Acting odd and acting strange
{You were always}
Trying to keep me in control
{You were always}
Flirting like some cheap hoe
{You were always}
Playing some annoying mental game
{You were always}
Wrong and you try and pass the blame
{You were always}
Acting like I wouldn't go
{You were always}
(But hear the new diffence though)
{Smiling}
But now I've moved along I'm more than strong
{Smiling}
And on my way to major pay
{Smiling}
Cause I'm near the sky I'm rising high
{Smil... smiling}
Cause it feels so good
{Smiling}
Cause I'm moving quick, believe me chick
{Smiling}
Now you're out of the way I fight the day
{Smiling}
You're a slag and you're swag
{Smiling}
You wouldn't test me if you could

[Wiley]
But now we're
{Smiling}
You see, now I'm...
{Smiling}
But now we're
{Smiling}
You see now I'm...
{Smiling} {smiling}</pre>
