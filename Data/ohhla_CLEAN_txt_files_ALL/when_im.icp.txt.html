(When I'm Clownin)

[Violent J]
I get silly
Like something lace my philly
Been known to pop a pilly
And cop a check with billy
(When I'm Clownin)
My heart beat poundin
I sweat so much I'm drownin
Because my shows astoundin
And faygo grape I'm downin
(When I'm Clownin)
Aabrakadabra alakazam what have ya,
Quick slight of hand I stab ya
Demons crawl out and grab ya
(When I'm Clownin)
There's plenty laughing
Blood on the walls what happened?
A massive murder stabbin
Cuz wicked shit I'm blabbin
(When I'm Clownin)
Shit come alive
And don't no one survive
Off the light rig I dive
And this shit ain't no jive
(When I'm Clownin)

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
I'm Psycoilly
Snatch out your icy grilly
I owes the mob a milly
Bout to knock off a chillys
(When I'm Clownin)
Mad hoes I'm springin
They want my dingalingin (ooh let's fuck)
They singin I keep my hatchet swingin'
(When I'm Clownin)
I I I'm super sick
Bones o bobber shoot you quick
Why you cuz youz a dick

(VJ - is he dead?)

Poke him use a stick
(When I'm Clownin)
I'm heavy high powered
Mad energy devoured
The whole milky way sour
Let my acid rain shower
(When I'm Clownin)
Everything's a joke
That angels wings are broke
So hot to speak a spoke
I freak this till I croak

[Clown noises]

Clowinin'

Wicked wicked clowns!
