[Chorus]
I have tried in vain, never had success
So it seems my life is nothing but a mess
I have lost, my only friends
Now it seems I have to start again
Merry go round~!

[Royce Da 5'9"]
My life's been goin around and round since '95
Went from goin somewhere to about to die
Went from callin my chick a chicken cause she look like she got poultry around her thighs
to callin your piece a chicken cause she got no teeth, and she got crow feet around her eyes
How hard are y'all? I got a heart the size of Arkansas, count to five
These birds gon' hit the ground and they ain't from out the sky
Went from havin a outta-this-world flow to doin a video doin the coon dance
to watchin my good friend Eminem winnin a Moonman
I remember cause I was in New York with all of my boys to start shit
Lettin them stay with me, long story short they tore up my corporate apartment
Went from bein a kid addicted to basketball
to bein a ignorant nigga addicted to alcohol (addicted to alcohol)
Round and round we GO is how this movie would end
The self proclaimed king of my city, not really, just truly the king of losin a friend
Who woulda thought this dude from the Park that's true to his art would lose?
Or win just by givin his thoughts and views (thoughts and views)

[Chorus]

[Royce Da 5'9"]
You would hear that Ryan's skilled, might even hear Ryan kills
You would never hear Ryan steals, here to put the "I" in "ill"
My mind is still like a merry-go-round spill
Like leavin only guns to my kids when I'm killed, I got an iron will
Intellect of Zion, I done went from high on pills
to triumph, to hidin from bills to buyin buildings
Then I went from writin for Dre to wonderin if my head was on straight
On the sideline feelin forgot about, listenin to "Forgot About Dre"
From there I went to about a bottle a day, tellin who WE know "Get outta my face!"
Okay, I know what Kino said about Dre
I look at Kino to this day like that was a stupid mistake
But if it wasn't for him doin THAT, what would I be doin today?
If it wasn't for Ca$his sayin that he gon' beat my ass then 
me and Em probably wouldn't even be laughin about us gettin past it
If it wasn't for me bein outcasted
I woulda never been on the underground rappin with (SLAUGHTERHOUSE~!)
