What about now
I don't even feel that I can cope with
The situation that a nigga in
Nigga gotta go for broke but I
Be thinkin' about the consequences of my actions
Cause if anything go wrong I'ma have to go out blastin'
I can't see myself washed-up with 25 with a L
Nigga like me I'd rather be dead than down in hell
But I gotta do something
Cause bein' broke this just ain't me
So I guess that I'ma find out which one force could control my destiny
I'm willing if God can give me out that shit
Cause if he can't and if I die I hope that I am on his list
To make it to heaven cause this 211 might turn into a 187
But - I might be the victim
Only thing good - no more stressin
Smith &amp; Wesson in my hand so here I go
So - between the devil and God I'ma see who love me the most

Between heaven and hell where'll I go
I don't know and right about know a nigga just can't cope
Smith &amp; Wesson in my hand so here I go
So - between the devil and God I'ma see who love me the most

I wish that I had another way up out this shit - but it
Seems that wishes don't come true when it comes to shit like this
Funny thing to happen to a nigga like me
Cause I remember I had a B-grade, ???? C
But - runnin' around with the homies resulted
In a lot of conflicts
By the middle of the ninth grade I became a convict
Got convicted of attempted murder to the C.Y.A. --&gt; (California Youth Authority)
Now look at the muthafuckin' price I gotta pay
Out on parole
Can't get a job
Cause I got a felony and being black
Is another strike against me
What can I do?
And where can I turn? 
Which way can I go?
I don't know but I just can't get with this shit no more
Loc even though I'm knowin' that this shit is wrong G
But I - can't go on for long livin' with this poverty
They got me stressin' cause I'm black and they don't like me
For that simple fact and since I bang they wanna strike me
How do them
Muthafuckas criticize this shit I do
With all this shit in this
Living hell they send me through
So with this Smith &amp; Wesson in my hand here I go
So between the devil and God I'ma see who love me the most
(Who love me the most)

Between heaven and hell where'll I go
I don't know but right about know a nigga just can't cope
Smith &amp; Wesson in my hand so here I go
So - between the devil and God I'ma see who love me the most

Now I'm crippin' up
Out of the muthafuckin' cut yeah
Nigga it's that nut that nigga let you know that he didn't give a fuck
Bangin on wax, better yet
Bangin on facts nigga this ain't no studio banger here
Nigga representin' that muthafuckin' Rip Killas
Niggas Nationwide know it's the A-D Drive
Hated by many
Loved by few respected on every side
Nigga South Side capital C-o-m-p-t-o-n
Puttin' on endo, drinkin' on a fifth of gin
Ready to sin ain't
Goin' to heaven cause I'm bailin' with the devil on my side
Ready to homicide, 1-8-7 slip and die
Down to die and today that's why I don't be givin a fuck 
Nigga A's up to all my enemies cause I wish you bad luck
Nigga what's up?!
B-A-B-Y G's
Y'all know what time it is
A nigga be waitin' now it's time for a nigga to get them ends
Whether to spend a C-note or end up to blowin' my real Locs
Much love to my niggas offerin bud and shit for you I ?roam?
So you know
That a nigga still representin' (muthafuckaaaas!)
It ain't no muthafuckin' bullshittin

Between heaven and hell where'll I go
I don't know but right about know a nigga just can't cope
Smith &amp; Wesson in my hand so here I go
So - between the devil and God I'ma see who love me the most...</pre>
