This some grown man shit right here
Listen

[Rapper Big Pooh]
I'm trying to man up see whats really good with you
Gentleman's approach, not bring it hood to you
Same things that you hear everyday like
"Hey ma, hey boo, baby whats your name"
Please pull up a seat, I'm so glad you came
My mother call me Thomas you can do the same
Damn its so refreshing when you calling out my name
Been Pooh for so long it doesn't sound the same
My occupation rap and I make a little change
I see you not impressed with what this life brings
Finished school, got a job, girl do your thing
It's a lot of independent women wanna be claimed
Marry into money or marry into fame, or at least give birth to a check
WIth all due respect lets two-step in the name of like
Who says we gotta do the waltz all day and all night, it's like

[Hook]
If love is not enough
We don't have to rush
Come around, I'll slow it down just you
Lady you should be
Right here next to me
Come around, I'll slow it down just for you

[Rapper Big Pooh]
We can go to the movies
I'll take you to the park and promise to have you home before the lights go out
Steady asking you questions what your life about
Oh and me, mine's everything I scribe about
No doubt this my life and
Dedicated to this witting sacrificing everything for it
Wasted time I can't afford
So if it ain't you/then you know I'm cooped up to the record..

[Phonte]
I'll scoop you up in me Porshe, sike
You know I got a Nissan
That I'm still paying for, still got a lease on
But it don't matter 'cause that ain't my aim to get you
I got fame, but you know that just ain't the issue
Because you're looking like a woman of virtue
So well-rounded, no wonder your're in my circle
And normally you probably wouldn't give me the time of day
'Cause Tay got rhymes, but no he ain't got time to waste

[Hook]

[Phonte]
Sometimes I think I'm from another world (preach)
When I'm trynna tell a woman just exactly where I stand that (aight)
I want a girl, when I want a girl
And when I don't want a girl, I want a girl who understands that
And that's some hard shit to explain
To a woman that's in love with you, it's a pitiful thing
Until I had to figure
That I don't wanna play around, but I don't wanna settle down
And that's a man's dilemma, 'cause every man remembers
How his daddy and his uncles did it
'Cause more than likely that's the way they're gonna do it
I know it sound fucked up and most wont admit it
But yo, I gotta face it 'cause I know I'm living through it
'Cause when the party stops and niggaz get old
And the chain and the cars and the houses get sold, and that
Other side of the bed gets cold, you don't wanna be alone
So girl I'm trynna hold you..

[Hook]

[Vamp Out]
Ohhh baby (Take it slow, take it slow, take it slow, take it slow)
What you need to do is
Take it slow with me
Slow it down a little bit (Take it slow, take it slow, take it slow, take it slow)
We don't have to rush into anything serious
(Take it slow, take it slow, take it slow, take it slow)
No we don't, take it from me (Take it slow, take it slow, take it slow, take it slow)
My name is Percy and I make miracles if you take it slow with me baby
(Take it slow, take it slow, take it slow, take it slow)</pre>
