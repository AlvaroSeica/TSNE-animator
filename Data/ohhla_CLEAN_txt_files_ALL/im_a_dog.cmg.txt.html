Everybody, want a drink for free
Meet C.M.G., in the VIP - 2X

[Lil' Keke]
All black seat back, on a Saturday night
0-5 so live, and the vibe is right
Don Ke on the scene, nigga cuff your hoe
Valet here's a hundred, park mine at the do'
The big dog's out, leave the pups on the porch
C.M.G. lighting up, like a brand new torch
I'm one deep, in a brand new Porsche
I'm loving the top down, and I'm chrome of course
I'm Lil' Ke, rated X who's next
It is just what it is, and your man got plex
Hoes on tip toes, and they trying to audition
It takes more than ass, to impress the Commission
DJ play the song, now they start to ball
Southside kingpin, it's the new black mob
I'm a dog, and I chase the cat
I'm a pit ball playa, and I'm up to bat

[Hook - 2X]
Mack if I want to, play if I want to
Simp with a bitch, is the thang that I don't do
Pimp game, it demand respect
I'm a dog, with a chain on is neck

[Lil' Keke]
So grind if I want to, shine if I want to
New wrist watches, and chains for my whole crew
At the playground, bitches wanna stay down
Rocks in both ears, that's the way that I play now
I'm a mack, in a jet black Lac
Franks and Benjamins, is all a nigga stack
Off the block, so I threw away the crack
Nothing like making money, when you good with the rap
O.G.'s real niggaz, on the hood give me dap
And a dime in the building, sitting up on my lap
Bitch niggaz running up, and getting slapped
Don be on the grind, while they sleeping taking naps
Parking lot pimping, but I go inside
If these freaks ain't fucking, then they will not ride
And I don't give a damn, man I do high side
Add two shots of Hen, and I'm ready to slide

[Hook - 2X]

[Lil' Keke]
I close up shops, on bops tonight
C.M.G. in the wind, like a delta flight
Shooting whales from the 4's, call me Spiderman
Keep a black 4-5, I'm a rider man
I don't simp with these hoes fa sho, it's no never
Got volley ball teams, that's down to do whatever
Trick niggaz spend, wanna bust your pocket
Ain't trying to do' knock it, cause it's all for profit
When they check out a playa, they can see my mack
Cause it's one thang fa sho, bitch the Don is back
It be nothing but cash, so don't write that check
I'm a dog, with a chain on his neck

[Hook - 2X]

(*talking*)
With a chain, on his neck
I'm a dog yeah-yeah, holla</pre>
