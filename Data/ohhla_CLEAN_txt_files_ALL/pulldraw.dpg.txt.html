[Snoop Dogg]
D.P.G.C. ha ha
D-A-Z, and the Bigg D-O double-G
Little somethin' for the ladies
Let me sing it to 'em one time nephew
Yeah, check this out

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
When I put this thang on you
There ain't nothin' you can do 'cept pull ya draws down
(They got to) Pull ya draws down (Ya got to)
When I put this thang on you
There ain't nothin' you can do 'cept pull ya draws down
(Ya got to) Pull ya draws down (Ya got to)

[Snoop Dogg]
I just left the weight room, your boy tryin' to get bigger
It's Friday night, it's just me and my nigga
We on the hunt, on the scout, tryin' to turn a bitch out
And when we get 'em, dig how we did 'em
We treat 'em like stars...
VIP, free drinks at the bar
Just tell 'em you're with the entourage
The Bigg Bo$$ Doggy Dogg in charge
Everything's exquisite... 
Big thangs we get it, now let me get it
Matter of fact let me hit it
You know Wednesdays is Friends Days, you cool with it?
And Thursdays is her day
And Friday is my day, to fly away
And ain't no fly away
So tip-tip with a nigga like right away

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
When I put this thang on you
There ain't nothin' you can do 'cept pull ya draws down
(They got to) Pull ya draws down (Ya got to)
When I put this thang on you
There ain't nothin' you can do 'cept pull ya draws down
(Ya got to) Pull ya draws down (Ya got to)

[Daz Dillinger]
When I whip this thang, out on you
You pull 'em up, I'll pull 'em down, now it's all on you
Baby boo with no clue now she throwin' a hint
We gettin' bent, gettin' blown, now I'm yellin' (oh shit!)
It's like hide and go get it and I'm lookin' to get it
She wearin' skin tight panties and it's properly fitted
I wanna do somethin' sneaky with you
A mnage  trois, I'm gettin' freaky with you
Smack it once, smack it twice, boy you're nothin' nice
Her heady hit the beddy now I turn off the lights
I Pendergrass her and ask her "How did ya like it?"
She said "Diggy Daz you the one that I'm likin"
And drop it like it's H-O-T 'cause it's nothin' to do it
And this is how you do it
(So won't you blaze up the weed with me and my cousin
With a little Moet we finna have the club buzzin')

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
When I put this thang on you
There ain't nothin' you can do 'cept pull ya draws down
(They got to) Pull ya draws down (Ya got to)
When I put this thang on you
There ain't nothin' you can do 'cept pull ya draws down
(Ya got to) Pull ya draws down (Ya got to)

[Kurupt]
Just went to the store, switches and some more Coronas
I gotta keep it cool by the pool
Cause the ladies got on nothin' but bikinis
Tryin' to get a nigga to come over and just
(Show 'em what I'm workin' with)
I'll take three, you three and me
We gon' smoke, we gon' drank
Have ya ever seen dank this green? This red?
Take it to the head, give me some head
This orange, this purple
This the type of shit that might hurt you
Baby just slide, get on the top
Twerk it like a fo', up and down hop
Show me what you got, show your friend too
Better show your other friend exactly what to do
But I already knew, you already knew
This ain't shit new, show Snoop and Daz too

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
When I put this thang on you
There ain't nothin' you can do 'cept pull ya draws down
(They got to) Pull ya draws down (Ya got to)
When I put this thang on you
There ain't nothin' you can do 'cept pull ya draws down
(Ya got to) Pull ya draws down (Ya got to)</pre>
