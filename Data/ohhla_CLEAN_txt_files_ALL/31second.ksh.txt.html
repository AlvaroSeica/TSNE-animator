Typed by: AZ Lyrics

(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8)
(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8)
(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8)
(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8)

Caught up
I'm drowing in this crowded sound
I've fallen underneath
So loud it's pounding
All around me
There's no time for you and me

We could be having the night of our lives

Pull the fire alarm
I would scream 'there's a bomb in the building'
For 31 Seconds Alone

Break the hands on the clocks
I would change all the locks in a minute
For 31 Seconds Alone

Baby I'm tired of running wild
With all this time
Out on my own

Pull the fire alarm
I would scream 'there's a bomb in the building'
For 31 Seconds Alone

(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8)
(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8)
(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8)
(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8)
(31 Seconds Alone)

I need more than a pinch of sand
This hourglass is running out now
Much more than your promises
Need some consiousness
To turn this around

We could be having the night of our lives

Pull the fire alarm
I would scream 'there's a bomb in the building'
For 31 Seconds Alone

Break the hands on the clocks
I would change all the locks in a minute
For 31 Seconds Alone

Baby I'm tired of running wild
With all this time
Out on my own

Pull the fire alarm
I would scream 'there's a bomb in the building'
For 31 Seconds Alone

(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8)
(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8)
(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8)
(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8)
(31 Seconds Alone)

(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8)
(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8)
(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8)
(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8)
(31 Seconds Alone)
(alone alone alone)

We could be having the night of our lives
If only we had some time
(time time time time time)

Pull the fire alarm
I would scream 'there's a bomb in the building'
For 31 Seconds Alone

Break the hands on the clocks
I would change all the locks in a minute
For 31 Seconds Alone

Baby I'm tired of running wild
With all this time
Out on my own

Pull the fire alarm
I would scream 'there's a bomb in the building'
For 31 Seconds Alone

(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8)
(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8)
(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8)
(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8)
(31 Seconds alone)
(we could be having the night of our lives)

(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8)
(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8)
(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8)
(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8)
(we could be having the night of our lives)
(31 Seconds alone)

(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8)
(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8)
(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8)
(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8)
(we could be having the night of our lives)
(31 Seconds alone)

(We could be having the night of our lives)
(31 Seconds alone)
(We could be having the night of our lives)</pre>
