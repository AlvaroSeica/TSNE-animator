[Intro: Rick Ross]
Yeah
We came in Anguilla
More money than you ever heard of
Gotta master the art of living young nigga
Ain't never think id get this much nigga
Let man explain it to them
Oh Lord please don't stop baby

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
I seen a home boy die in cold blood
Eyes rolled in his head weren't no love
His mamma sold pussy that it was a fiend
He from a place where niggas don't believe in dreams
[Repeat]

Niggas snorting potty get your head right
Get your dick sucked sitting at the red light
Now you catching cases, talking home invasions
How you get upon how the fuck you playing
Can't be playing games on the home field
Open up like a God on that dome peel
We ain't had shit when we went to school
Now it's flat screens up in every room
Nigga do the math, got you full of crap
Tub full of money, candy on the slat
Teflove underneath my fresh tag
Bellhobble walking out with 40 bags
I can fuck a model for an autograph
8 cars, still make her call a cab

Shout out to Def Jam
Shout out to Waner Brothers
Shout out to Dope boy, we all need each other
I'm in Anguilla, I'm smoking killa
We run the game, pussy boy go cry a river

[Chorus: Chief Keef]
A fuck nigga, that's that shit I don't like
A snitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like
A bitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like
Sneak disser, that's that shit I don't like

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
(This Chicago, nigga!)
They smile in my face is what I don't like
They steal your whole sound, that's a soundbite
The media crucify me like they did Christ
They want to find me not breathing like they found Mike
A girl'll run her mouth only out of spite
But I never hit a woman never in my life
I was in too deep like Mekhi Phifer
In that pussy so deep I could have drowned twice
Rose gold Jesus piece with the brown ice
Eating good, vegetarian with the brown rice
Girls kissing girls, cause it's hot, right?
But unless they use a strap-on then they not dykes
They ain't about that life, they ain't about that life
We hanging out that window it's about to be a Suge night
Free Bump J, real nigga for life
Shoutout to Derrick Rose, man that nigga nice
Shout out to L-E-P, Jay Boogie right?
Chief Keef, King Louie, this is Chi, right? right?!

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Chief Keef]
(Young Chop on the beat)
Fake Gucci, that's that shit I don't like
Smoking on this dope, higher than a kite
This bitch gon' love me now, she gon' let me pipe
Screaming Sosa, that's that nigga that I like
I don't want relations, I just want one night
Cause a thirsty bitch, that's the shit that I don't like
I got tats up on my arm, cause this shit is life
And I stunt so much in clothes, cause I'm living life
I come up on the scene, and I'm stealing light
Bitch I'm high off life, got me feeling right
Bitch I'm Chief Keef, fuck who don't like
And bitch we GBE, we just go on sight

[Chorus]

[Verse 4: Jadakiss]
I done sold purple, I done sold white
Running outta work, that's that shit I don't like
She never let me hit it, she gave me dome twice
She blowing up my phone, that's that bitch I don't like
Nah, jean jacket with the sleeves cut
Put the pressure on 'em just when they think that I eased up
Thirty for the Cuban, 'nother 30 for the Jesus
Believe in ourselves when nobody else believed us, suckas

[Chorus]</pre>
