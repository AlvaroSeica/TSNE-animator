Knowimsaying? Straight up and down

[Islord] (Beretta 9)
Aiyo, 44 automatics (automatics) mack 10's (mack 10's)
Mack 11's (mack 11's) all dipped down in black
It be the G-O-D's reppin' that seven (seven)
Cuz we keep it ill with the weapons
44 automatics (automatics) mack 10's (mack 10's)
Mack 11's (mack 11's) all dipped down in black
It be the G-O-D's reppin' that seven (seven)</pre>
