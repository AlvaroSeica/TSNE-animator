[Co$$]
They call me gladiator, daddy made a hard hitter
Walk with a limb like a pimp do
A skitzo and a mental
When I'm hitting on that indo
They say I'm too complex
I gotsta simplify the info for the dummies and the bimbo's
I be running laps, running, burning wax with my murder raps
Any beat you put me on is homicide, I murder tracks
Feel the heat, still the illest villain on a killing spree
That steal a female from a nigga, if she feeling me
Who the shit, who the fuck you think Co$$ you the shit
The coolest kid, the ruler is back, bout to do it big
Daddy's back, sitting on chrome in my Cadillac
She don't call me Co$$, she calls me Daddy Mack, I likes that
Live and fo' to five
Flow and rise and take the knife back
My super duper lines scalt your eyes and leave your sight black
I got the coldest sound, speed it up and slow it down
It really don't matter, either way it's going down

Yeah, nigga, we still out smoking that weed
Dranking that drank
Been up and stay up working hard mothafucka
That's right, shit</pre>
