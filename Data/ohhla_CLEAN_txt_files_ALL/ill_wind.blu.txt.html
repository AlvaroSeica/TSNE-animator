[Blue Raspberry]
When I first stepped on the scene, ya'll just got petrified
Fled back to your lab, like you was being chased by homicide
My vocal skills strong as Tical, and it will never stear you wrong
And all these bullshit ears in the industry, your careers wont be lasting long, now
Hold up, wait a minute, time for Blue to get up in this
Niggas is acting wild, tricks are biting my style
I ain't gonna let it ride, no way, no how
Damn, right, a change gon' come
You forgot the Blue, I came from
Cuz when I copped the, power you bless
I got a lot to get off my chest

[Chorus: Blue Raspberry]
No, Ill Wind, blow away, let me rest today
You blowing me no good
No, Ill Wind, blow away, back up out my space
You blowing me no good

[Blue Raspberry]
Yadada, ha, yes, I'm feeling good
A long time, I know I should of been
Shining, like a diamond, but that's ok, I had a chance to grow
So here I am, I dare to beg legit
And all you fellas know exactly who I am
It's Blue, raise a fool, and yet, it's Wu-Tang
Blue Raspberry is my name

[Chorus to fade]</pre>
