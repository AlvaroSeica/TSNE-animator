[Wiz Khalifa]
Clear the run way baby
I get money from sunday to sunday lady
Oh behave I'm young, rich, famous
Tryin to keep my pockets on schwarzenegger
O.G in my swisher so my blunt taste flavor
Don't it
Ya'll niggas can get it if you want it
Tryna catch a flight I'm in the back seat playing Xbox
Car service just chillen
Burners in the wall
Money all through the ceiling
Hit Spitta on the phone
Tell my dawg that we killin, these fuckin blogs
They love a star and I'm flashin'
Life just like a movie, no casting
Asked if the game kinda slow
But I'm a treat it like a ashton
Pedal to the medal I'm mashin
All we know is big money, medical weed, and fashion
So try your best to imagine,
Bro

[Chorus]
I'm rollin' up another one
Starring out this
Window, window, window, windoww
They tellin' me to change how I'm livin'
But it's all I knoww
Seen it in every city on my
Way out to another one, nother one, nother one, nother onee
You find me anywhere that paper go (go)
Ohhh (ohhhh) ohh

[Curren$y]
Bone ribs, double s's, with the flow shifts
Windows 20/20 clear, beat these 20's on the rear
Order da car service
If I feel as though I don't want to steer [?]
Bitches freeze in the xenon head lights, like a deer
But not out of fear, she lookin'
Cause there's money over here
Shine from above these land lovers, I'm a chandelier
My girl gotta pocket bubbler in her purse
She keep it G and pack the bowl
With weed and let me hit it first
Ain't tryna be a hogg dawgy
All I want is what I'm worth
80 days, 80 stages baby all around the earth
Amazing race for the paper you suckers eatin' dirt
Chew some orbit gum, brush your teeth,
And scrape your tongue
Fresh as they come, second to none
Pretty woman flirt battin eyelashes they need guidance
Lace them up like my new balance
And keep flyin'
The closest that you lames ever came
To the planes was a palm pilot

[Chorus]
I'm rollin' up another one
Starring out this
Window, window, window, windoww
They tellin' me to change how I'm livin'
But it's all I knoww
Seen it in every city on my
Way out to another one, nother one, nother one, nother onee
You find me anywhere that paper go (go)
Ohhh (ohhhh) ohh</pre>
