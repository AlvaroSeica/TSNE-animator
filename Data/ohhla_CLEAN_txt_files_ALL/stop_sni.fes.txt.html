[Intro: Fes Taylor]
Fuck all snitches (all y'all snitch ass niggaz)
My nigga Specs right here, baby (Uh-huh)
Specs, what up? (We gon' end this shit now)
I know you talking, I see you...

[Fes Taylor]
Since Specs been gone, I heard niggaz running they mouth
Like Taylor won't put a gun in your mouth
I run in your houses, ya Pop's a detective
So my niggaz harder than erections
Try to send us to department of corrections
Extortion, make you pay for your protection
Your life like a cartoon, mines favor a western
You a squirrel in the misfit world
Matter of fact, son, I should've fucked Jim Lick's girl
And to think I went to Miami, savored the loads
It broke my heart, niggaz said that you told
All I need is one shot, stain on your shirt like cum spots
I'm from blocks where niggaz keep they gun cocked (Killah Hill, nigga)
Batman is waiting for Perm like smokey and crack
I'm Jordan, you more like Charles Oakley instead
Jay the Bird, y'all niggaz never play the curb
What are you the next white rapper? King of the Burbs
I laugh at ya, send my staff at ya
Even my A&amp;R's hold heat, Real and Saf blast ya
I've seen a paper work, with niggaz signatures
John Handocks is John Doe's, I finish ya
Like Mr. Cee, you know me, Mr. T
Six chainsaw, hopping out of different vec's
I had ya whole neighborhood shook
Watch ya plate when you ate with a crook
You able to look (no) meet in the face and repeat what you said
I'm 'bout to write Specs a kite, send him a piece of ya head, nigga

[Chorus: Fes Taylor]
Niggaz is telling, right, and I ain't never lied
None of you niggaz in the first place, first place
I keep it thorough like my birth place, birth place
Specs told me to murder y'all in the worst way
Niggaz is telling, right, and I ain't never lied
None of you niggaz in the first place, first place
I keep it thorough like my birth place, birth place
Specs told me to murder y'all in the worst way, worst way</pre>
