[Chorus - repeated 8X in background]

[Foxx - over chorus]
AYY, Mr. Wipe Down ya heard me?
Foxx-a-milli-on
This one's be the, REEEEEEMIIIIIIX!!!
Bad Azz! Savage Life! Foxx-a-milli-on
Man you already KNOW what it is, ya heard me?
We still on, we still ridin on chrome, we still pullin up, manye up

[Foxx - Verse One]
(Yeah!) I pull up at the club V-I-P
Gas tank on "E" but all dranks on me (wipe me down!)
Fresh kicks, fresh white, tall tee
Fresh NFL hat, fresh bauds wit the crease (wipe me down!)
Pussy niggaz wanna hit me wit da heat
Real recognize real, real niggaz don't speak (wipe me down!)
Jiggalatin I been rollin bout a week
You can tell I got cake by the diamonds in my teeth (wipe me down!)
Black shades so you know a nigga rollin
They ain't check me at the door, so ain't no tellin what I'm holdin (wipe me down!)
Bad bitches they gon bust it wide open
Niggaz flashin they lil bread, but I'm the nigga they approachin (wipe me down!)
Small nigga, tall figures, y'all niggaz
crowd niggaz, we gon get Mac 11 and maul niggaz (wipe me down!)
Y'all niggaz call niggaz but my nigga
All killaz get ya issue and whoever fall wit ya

[Chorus 8X with Foxx repeating "shoulders, chest, pants, shoes" the last 4 times]

[Lil' Boosie - Verse Two]
B-O-O-S-I-E
B-A-D-A-Z-Z - that's me (wipe me down!)
Red bones caramel all o'em stop and stare
ALL o'em tryna steal my underwear (hahaha) (wipe me down!)
I like to floss like Rick Ross, got a hit called "Set It Off"
When I sang it E'RYBODY +set it off+ (wipe me down!)
Black mink damn I don't play wit me
I bust ya dome, eight whips on chrome, you can gon (wipe me down!)
Fresh fade, fresh J's on the corner
Playin spades; I'm a ordinary person, but I'm paid (wipe me down!)
Foxx flippin, Webbie smokin, and we chokin
on a WHOLE pound of purple, famous like a Ninja Turtle (wipe me down!)
Just left New York City, hooked up wit P. Diddy
Finna blow past 50, you gon have ta (wipe me down!)
We the best, I'm a FOOL, I'm the Hemi man
Red light, green light, yellow light, did it, man

[Chorus 8X with Foxx repeating "shoulders, chest, pants, shoes" the last 4 times]

[Webbie - Verse Three]
Hot drop, drop top, top drop
Hoes drop it like it's hot, yea nigga I'm the shit! (wipe me down!)
You see this ice on my wrist, how it glist
soon as the light hit, you can't lie the ice sick (wipe me down!)
Purple got me smellin funky red monkey
Five hunnid dollars on em you ain't seen these yet (wipe me down!)
BEATIN' you can hear me way around the corner
Paint wet wit the 24's on em that's a bet [Boom! Boom!] (wipe me down!)
Ol' lady's, baby momma's, do fianc√©s
niggaz wife, Savage Life, who I'm gonna fuck NEXT? (wipe me down!)
And I use a Lifestyle or the Magnum
or the Trojan or go head and use the barrel of the tech (wipe me down!)
Manye this chain hit me for a couple grand
Oh no I AIN'T complainin, just watch how you wipe my chest (wipe me down!)
A bad bitch wanted me to stay lil longer
I put that dick up on her but I had a flight to catch (wipe me down!)

[Foxx - Repeat 8X]
Shoulders, chest, pants, shoes
