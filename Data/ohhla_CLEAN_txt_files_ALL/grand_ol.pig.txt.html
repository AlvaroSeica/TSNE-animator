[Verse 1]
As I walk down the street, I see Mercy
desguised as broken men, their hands out
it's good for a dime or a dollar, for bread perhaps some gin
when I say don't have none
their eyes run right pass me and dance upon the sun
that's when I saw this sixty year old man Otis, his life
did go and come

[Chorus]
And as we dance this final romance, we sing hallelujah
and as she cries, cause her father lied, we sing hallelujah
I used to dance, dance, dance, dance, dance
they used to dance, dance, dance, dance, dance

[Verse 2]
When I first saw her, she pretended not to see me
and that is okay, cause I know I hurt her and probably deserve
every distant and fearfull gaze. I don't know where it came
from, I just pushed her, she fell so gracely ;then I looked in
the mirror and saw every man that mom dated, they trickled into me

[Chorus]
And as we dance this final romance, we sing hallelujah
and as we remind that he watched his friend die, we sing hallelujah
I used to dance, dance, dance, dance, dance
they used to dance, dance, dance, dance, dance
And as we dance this final romance, we sing hallelujah
and who knew that he would see his born-again seed, we sing hallelujah

I used to dance, dance, dance, dance, dance
I don't know what's going on, and I can't pretend to
I used to dance, dance, dance, dance
all I can do is rest her into my arms, but I still twitch and turn to
I used to dance,dance, dance, dance

[Verse 3]
I lit my house to, a god I don't understand
and fear too, we're placed here to decide
to live or to die, but we have no choice to choose
and as we spin around and around in circles
I just want to get home, you say, you'll get there later
but what about now, can't you swirl the hollow points?

[Chorus]
And as we dance this final romance, we sing hallelujah
and as pray for his mom that passed away, we sing hallelujah
I used to dance, dance, dance, dance, dance
they used to dance, dance, dance, dance, dance
And as we dance this final romance, we sing hallelujah
and as she cries, cause her father lied we sing hallelujah

(2X)
I used to dance, dance, dance, dance, dance
I don't know what's going on, and I can't pretend to
I used to dance, dance, dance, dance
all I can do is rest in her arms, but I still twitch and turn to</pre>
