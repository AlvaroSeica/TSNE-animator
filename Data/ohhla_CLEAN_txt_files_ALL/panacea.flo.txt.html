Song:   Panacea For the Poison
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

In my mind I hold the passion, panacea for the poison
My bruised and battered body washes up upon the shore
Send fleas from leaking wounds like rats from sinking ships
As I float off to forever with these words upon my lips
No I never asked for nothing and that's just what I got
As my pride does before I do as I follow muscle code
I wasted many days chasing brightly gleaming streams
As I fold into your presence, do I now know what it means

We could get old
And talk at the same time when we tell stories
If we let go
Impossible names rhyme in elegant poetry
What I sample in everything
It inundates my small town
I refuse the offers extended waiting for God
Now I never asked for nothing audible
So when the walls fall down and spin like water wheels
I'll pray for something logical
So when we all drown
I can cover bald spots with yamakas
Drawn from extra dimensional sources
Like in comic books
Choose your own adventure
I'm obsessing like a drug fiend
Fantasies of actors clandestinely having sex in love scenes
But why not amateurs openly sharing joy in sex scenes
Stand clear while I soak in this treasure trove of a wet dream
I can't tell what my problem is
Or even if there is one
Sail the celibacies much sooner than commit one
Escaping minor shake-ups but keep bracing for the big one
To make the choices obvious and save us from decisions

In my mind I hold the passion, panacea for the poison
My bruised and battered body washes up upon the shore
Send fleas from leaking wounds like rats from sinking ships
As I float off to forever with these words upon my lips
No I never asked for nothing and that's just what I got
As my pride does before I do as I follow muscle code
I wasted many days chasing brightly gleaming streams
As I fold into your presence, do I now know what it means

I dreamt of whimsy
In a fire fight with the in-the-line-of-fire flies
Watch the dusk go indigo and blush into a silent night
Birth immaculate conscious from a pregnant pause
In the August of my righteousness just waiting for the fall
The greater and the small, all for one and one for all
For all the S.O.S and we will rise to the call
I've bitten the hand that feeds and found myself bleeding here by
I'll only need what I need
But need will get me out of my groove
So I move to different tunes
Sunning in the warm weather
By the light of distant moons
There's tape men in the nation bring the monsoon
Season with the spectacle of people finding tools
Aphrodite, grown fools, and buyers sown booze
Let's throw out the cravings and things with no use
People dropping jewels, gems can't shine like odd light
To air is human, so the sky is our birth right

In my mind I hold the passion, panacea for the poison
My bruised and battered body washes up upon the shore
Send fleas from leaking wounds like rats from sinking ships
As I float off to forever with these words upon my lips
No I never asked for nothing and that's just what I got
As my pride does before I do as I follow muscle code
I wasted many days chasing brightly gleaming streams
As I fold into your presence, do I now know what it means

In my mind I hold the passion, panacea for the poison
My bruised and battered body washes up upon the shore
Send fleas from leaking wounds like rats from sinking ships
As I float off to forever with these words upon my lips</pre>
