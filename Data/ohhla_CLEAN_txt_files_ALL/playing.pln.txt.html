(Fire)

[ Plan B ]
One day you'll learn when you get burned
By then it will be too late you ya
Be too late for ya
When the fire spreads and burns
Don't you know?

[ VERSE 1: Plan B ]
He's just a kid off the estate
They call him little Jake
Today he tried to buy weed with his little mate
Up in the bits, but he's just a kid
So he was open to manipulation
He had to undergo initiation
And when some older boys saw the situation
They took the piss, now look at this
Little youth beatin up his only friend
The only one that weren't pretend
And even gave him the money for the pen
From mice to men and then to rats
But only a snake behaves like that
But the gang don't care for fools shootin caps
They're just happy that you fall for the trap

[ Labrinth ]
Playin with fire
It doesn't burn
The first time your hand
Walked through the flame
Playin with fire
Bitter and sweet
Oh no
Scorchin skin now
Hell on its way
Playin with fire

(Fire)
You're playin with fire

[ Plan B ]
One day you'll learn when you get burned
By then it will be too late for ya
Be too late for ya
When the fire spreads and burns, don't you know
Playin with fire

[ VERSE 2: Plan B ]
He's just a kid, but he feels like a man today
He joined a gang today
Been at a house party around the way
Doin illegal shit, but he's just a kid
Still he's in luck today, he got a fuck today
Yeah he bust his very first nut today
In some stupid bitch, today's movin quick
So quick, if you wear the wrong shoes you'll slip
Better keep up with the tempo, with a clique
Cause what they on is messed up, bruv
And now that he's rollin with these vexed up thugs
So what's next up, bruv?
Cause he's gonna make it his only mission
To better his position
In this little gang it's a competition
To the little man with a disposition
Holier than thou, he was born a Christian
All he worships now is an idealism
Wise men will tell you with age comes wisdom
And you can't be saved by religion
Unless you have faith, so it makes no difference
To the youths that are raised in the system
You don't have age on the side
Or any positive role models in their lives that provide insight
So they ain't gonna listen
As for Jake, he's already made his decision
And now he's just another poster boy for David Cameron's Broken Britain

[ Labrinth ]
Playin with fire
It doesn't burn
The first time your hand
Walked through the flame
Playin with fire
Bitter and sweet
Oh no
Scorchin skin now
Hell on its way
Playin with fire

[ Plan B ]
One day you'll learn when you get burned
By then it will be too late for ya
Be too late for ya
When the fire spreads and burns, don't you know
