[Intro]
Don't sniff cocaine, it's bad for you!
Don't smoke weed, it's bad for you!
Don't drink liquor, it's bad for you!
Don't eat food, it's bad for you - heh
Don't like money, its bad for you - HAHAHA~!
Yeah!
HB, comin from
Odd Future

[Hodgy Beats]
I swallow my pride, blueberry flavor
The kid spits next door sort of like a neighbor
Spaceship, crashed on America like a creator
Died and came back like, I'm a holy savior
Holy moly racer, Daytons on a scrapper
I clog muh'fuckers, nigga who scrappe her
Raped her (I don't know) R. Kelly taped her?
Niggaz want fades, I'ma give yo' ass a taper
I put that on Rodney, and my barber shawty
Carrying a shotty, cuttin up Bobby
I'm cutting up probably, cuttin up bodies
Chopped and screwed, e-ve-ry-bo-dy
Bitch I'm Hitler with e-ve-ry Nazi
Aiming at your face like we're paparazzi
Down comes confetti, intestines, spaghetti
On your mark, set, but you niggaz ain't ready

[Chorus]
Ready, set, go - RACE CAR!! {*4X*}
Ready, RACE CAR {*6X*}
Ready, set, go
RACE CAR!

[Hodgy Beats]
Speedin I'm a heathen in the hour of the evening
Odd Future tight nigga, can't be even
What's crackin, what's creasin? Crisco greasin
Chuck E Cheesin, why your girl got a frown on
Paint her face clown on
I pump up the volume, make sure the sound's on
To investigate I'm like a hound dog - dog hound
There's a dog found, put him in the dog pound
Throw him in the cage, watch the nigga bark now
Chompin on an oversized bone
Meet my impostor, oversized clone
Thoughts race in my mind, oversized dome
But I'm focused, drivin a Ford, Focus
Hustlin, harder, 'til I'm racin in the Lotus
Know this, one time he blew a nigga head off
Jumped in his race car (and what happened?)
He sped off~!

[Chorus]</pre>
