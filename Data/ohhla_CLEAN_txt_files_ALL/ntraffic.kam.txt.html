[Verse 1: KAM]
Rise and shine, it's a brandnew day
They say: Awww it's pour rainin, no lay
And cloud in sky so I can't play
I gotta get dressed and escape
Though traffic is callin' yes y'all in weep skirts
To the Swap Meat for some white T-Shirts
Plus, I just been paid
So let's roll up to R.P, for a skin fade
And go under the Triple-X as we exit
I gotta have that tie around the neck shit
I'm about to check this naggin' guards
So we all mad doggin' and saggin' hard
Lay back, pull this whore card, I ain't finna stop
For no wannabe raw gorilla cop
Time to hop, so let's get loose
If the street lookin' need full tank
Let's loose in traffic

[Chorus: KAM X3]
Watchin' the cars drove-by, nobody's catchin' Who-ride
Wanna test us I don't know why
I'm in traffic

[Verse 2: KAM]
Now, I'm fresh out the chair
So what y'all wanna do? - we gotta go somewhere
Cause I feel like givin' it up.. "FEEL LIKE GIVIN' UP"
Awww yeah, One Time just barkin' like Hounds
It's too hot, left the Parking Lot bumpin' the sounds
Damn, a nigga can't even kick it
Tried to defile it, and got a Hydrolic ticket
I'm takin' off of this clown and skated
Court sent me a bill and I still ain't paid it
Made it back to the tilt for a minute
Forgot the heat pack, now, I'm back up in it
Because I gotta go get gas 
And I'm already knowin' how long that shit last
Had to pump like ascend and duck
But at last cents pumpin' slow as fuck
No, I can't be stuck out like that
Cause fools out here no doubt might gap the toys
Lookin' fat in this detail, rounded up the boys
And then we bailed, in traffic

[Chorus: KAM]

[Verse 3: KAM]
So what's really goin' on?
I got the Ride that hoppin' like the bonny ass money gone
Thinkin' it's funny roam, cause I ain't want the jokes
So trip, cause I dipped on the 100 Spokes
To the city, I can't understand it
Sounded just like the motherchip landed
And didn't no quit, cause I got one more switch I'll get in
To get y'all tweakin
They're sayin' that's the fool that made Every Single Weekend
And other niggaz don't care 
When I be in the cut sayin: So Well, I see that nigga everywhere
Then go and switch on the tube 
And now, they're thinkin' I'm rich cause they see me with Ice Cube
But while they groove through them screens
I'm out rollin' the Chevy' with heavy starting on my Jeans
Dependin' on us, to hit y'all up while we're bendin' corners
Cause I'm known as a peace maker, on the L.A. streets
Wakin' black people up over gangster beats
I'm in traffic

[Chorus: KAM]</pre>
