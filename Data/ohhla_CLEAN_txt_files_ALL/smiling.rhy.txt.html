Talented Tenth
Me and Paulie Rhyme go back man
Van Hoek, {?} Heights, Cleveland

They never think about the well, 'til the water gone
While fast forward and trackin and replay the song
I'm so off that, scoffin at, birds that sweet rap
B-movie bystanders, bad lines, why act?
Little time for bullshit, grown man ways
I'm in the clip, verbal clip, seein righteousness pay
Trees, poppy seeds in my DNA
Born with a limp don't mean I walk that way

Sometimes I hate rap, bum fool ruined lil' gap
Put me on the TV, no need to emcee
Fight for your right, I fight for blind sight
Speak no, see no, hear goes to your flow
Like a rose for your show laugh at Nelly your ego
Your kin was kibbles and bits, we sharp for the trip
Simple learn to how spit, new champs for shanty town
What goes up, comes down, we your ringtones now~!

{Smiling faces, smiling faces}
{They're liiiiiies, and I've got proof}
{Oh lord, yes}

Everybody get low, I'm takin the highway
Layin a solid foundation 'fore I snatch up a Lisa Raye
Hip-Hop abortion for sin the way I move it
Obi Wan Don, victories to cool kid
Choosin my path that I walk on and so on
And I light every moment, excuse myself, I float on
So past the future like it stops at Michael Cooper
Ask the B's on my feet, the coolie right up underneath

I got a 3-2 for beef dude, rock the planet
like universal control the ultra verses your soul
Like lost letters on them buildings, roof for the children
Your girl catch feelings debate, you know the business
Loved ones we in this, fakes on that haterade
Move like them concave, point break tsunami waves
Up while you fade away, fitted while you laid out
You played we the new dawn, so let us, move on

{Smiling faces, smiling faces}
{They're liiiiiies, and I've got proof}
{Oh lord, yes}</pre>
