[Tino Cochino]
I got you, O.G. (That's right)
Radio X (Yeah)
T-No
Look

[Verse 1: Tino Cochino]
Here it is, once again, knock-knock, hello
Everybody make noise, T-I-N-O
Is in the room, who is gon' be my choice
I'll lick you up, but ya gotta be moist
BOOM, I got your girlfriend
Now I'm her man
Beep-beep, here the keys to the S.U.V.
We EEEEEAAAAARRRRRUUUUUMMMMM...
Go have your fun and cruise the whip
Because while you on me, I'm a eyes that chick
Gon' hit the beach, pick up a freak
And get loaf/love and a wild til the windows skeet-skeet

Chorus: Seven
"Love, you bet"
"Love, love-love, you better wake up..."
"Love you, bet"
"Love, love-love, you better wake up..."
"Love you" ("You lose")
"You lose me"
"Love you" ("You lose")
"You lose me" --&gt; Mary Wells

[Verse 2: Frost]
You two-time me, I two-time you
I'm the O.G., I thought you knew
You call your friends, I'm a call my crew
And we, can get together like a two-piece suit
I'm sippin' on my liquor
You gettin' a little thicker
Don't mean to sound bitter
Don't be stalkin' me on Twitter
I bounce, rock, skate
Like a D, I rotate
She a little wild thang
Sweet like a sugar cane

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 3: Baby Bash]
Shape up or ship it out
Put all this in your mouth
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout
Hell yeah, baby girl, I'm well endowed
Hooker to the right, hooker to the left
Make up, when I'm tryin' to catch your breath
She got my thang, in a guillotine choke
While I sit back and roll this dro {*coughing*}

Hook: Baby Bash
Humble county in my life
I need a track star, don't need no wife
Humble county in my life
I need a track star, don't need no wife

Repeat Chorus Twice</pre>
