[Intro: Ice-T]
1994, Body Count still in the house 
They did everything they could do to take us out
But like any good monster that just made us stronger
You see, they don't like us and they don't like you
The Body Count fans
Cause they know we stand for three things:
Truth, Justice and fuck the American Way
That word justice got me fucked up though
Twenty cops in the street, and two go to jail
Thousands of people died in wars overseas and it's justice?
You think they give a fuck about us?
You're a fool

[Verse One: Ice-T]
Born yellow, born brown, born red
Born black, BORN DEAD!!
DEAD!! DEAD!! DEAD!! BORN DEAD!!
BORN DEAD!! HA HA HA!! WE'RE BORN DEAD!!
Born Asian, born Jewish, born Latino
Born poor, BORN DEAD!!
DEAD!! DEAD!! DEAD!! BORN DEAD!!
BORN DEAD!! HA HA HA!! WE'RE BORN DEAD!!
But you don't hear me though

[Break: quotes from the American's Media]
..Any thing is going to confuse us..
..Any thing is going to confuse us.. DEAD!!
USA military officials said..
Iraqi official said..
USA military officials say..
Iraqi official said..

[Hook: Ice-T]
DEAD!! DEAD!! YOU'RE DEAD!!
New York (YOU'RE DEAD!!) Atlanta (YOU'RE DEAD!!) Chicago (YOU'RE DEAD!!) 
Oakland (YOU'RE DEAD!!) Miami (YOU'RE DEAD!!) Detroit (YOU'RE DEAD!!)

[Interlude: Ice-T]
Every day I gotta get up out my motherfucking bed
Put on my motherfucking gun down in my motherfucking pants
Cause motherfuckers out here is tripping
How the fuck is you gonna get up every morning;
Trying to worry about if you gonna make it to the next evening?
Do you understand?
Sometimes we take for granted
The little things like food, like freedom

[Outro: Ice-T]
Born in Somalia, born in South America
Born in South Africa, born in South Central
BORN DEAD!!
DEAD!! DEAD!! DEAD!! BORN DEAD!!
BORN DEAD!! HA HA HA!! WE'RE BORN DEAD!!</pre>
