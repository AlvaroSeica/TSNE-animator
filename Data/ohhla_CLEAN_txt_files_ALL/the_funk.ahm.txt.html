Song:   We Want the Funk
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

{If you didn't come to dance, then you don't want the funk} - *2X*

{If you didn't come to dance, then you don't want the funk}
	{We want the funk!} - *both 4X*

[Ahmad]
Dig it the mic is mine I'm the incredible man, with the gift of gab
And when I speak you'll be doin the freak
So if, you don't want the funk then you a punk
Everybody out of they chairs should go for theirs, and
if you can find anyone better or as bad as mine
that's thick as a dreadlock and rocks like Lenny Kravitz
then you done great, you done good
Wait I hope they told you, I'll explode to any track
I'm back on top, ready to drop bombs
I'm the only rapper that can rap like this, then do the twist
So HOLD UP WAIT A MINUTE let put the boom back in it
to show the Joneses can win it, and that's my crew
That's my clan, that's my posse
The niggaz with the funky tunes, turn up the volume
All you ballers, with your six-four Impalas
and bass comin out of your trunk, you better holla if you want the funk

{If you didn't come to dance, then you don't want the funk}
	{We want the funk!} - *both 4X*

[Ahmad]
Word now everybody get up, then sit back down and yell (HO!)
The niggarole's back with a verse and it gets worse
By worse I mean better than you and I can do
crews and never lose in fights because I write
and flip scripts I rip up punks and do a cheer
Think I'd ring the funk bell yell (party over here!)
Now peep what I wrought and maybe I even got
a million funk styles for ya bay-bay
In stacks so when I rap the claps come
through I'm new but been hearin cheers for years and
Fear is a mindstate, I rip up raps and do up dance stuff
The great Ahmad, if you agree then nod
your head like this or like that I can rap with anyone
and still won't fall, I do it all
So y'all kids with tapes on your shelves and
twelves boomin out of your trunk, you better yell if you want the funk

{If you didn't come to dance, then you don't want the funk}
	{We want the funk!} - *both 6X*

[Ahmad]
Well I'm still kickin the funk, don't believe it you don't have to
But, bet a buck, you gon' believe it when I leave it stuck
Imprinted, through a rhyme I invented
to indent your skull cause I got SOUL
Everybody get ready, then set go and when I let go
of the microphone, get your jam on
But one more thing before I sing cause I'm fat
And ask for you please get off your rump
and SCREAM if you want the funk

{If you didn't come to dance, then you don't want the funk}
	{We want the funk!} - *both 4X*

{If you didn't come to dance, then you don't want the funk}
	{Party over here, bust you over there} - *2X*
		*repeat all 8X*

{If you didn't come to dance, then you don't want the funk} - *2X*

{If you didn't come to dance..} {We want the funk!}

{Give me that funky baby, give me that funk} - {We want the funk!}
		*repeat this 8X*

{If you didn't come to dance, then you don't want the funk}
	{We want the funk!} - *repeat to fade*</pre>
