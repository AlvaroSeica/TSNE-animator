{*scratching*} Break, it

[Deda]
I want it all
Yo let me make a call on my cellular
I'm telling ya, taking care of business on a regular
I'm maxed with the 40oz of Old Gold Soul
At the store down the hill, cause this is how I chill
So let me break it down for the whole New York
Its go before you blow, right
I gotta keep my flow
I smoke herb for my peace and to release
Let go and lay back while cousin catch a contact
In this life time dealing with drugs and crime
And niggaz that's way out of line wasting they minds
With no time to play I just parlay
With my words, my hands, the music and the micstand
My pockets is flat, so you know I'm on the mission
My wears is warn, but they clean I'm on the scene
Not even depressed, only showing progress
Paved the way and I say, nothing more, nothing less

I rap for listeners, bluntheads, fly ladies and prisoners
{*scratching*} For real, nothing more, nothing less

[Deda]
I hear the sound of an average yapping
Saying some nonsense that's totally distracting
Reacting to put a chump back in his spot
Simply real, you try to flex and get stopped
Dropped like a habit, or even a bomb
Blowing up in your face, causing bodily harm
I see you in the news, kid I payed my dues
I walked the rocky road, and I scuffed my shoes
I sang the blues, and I broke a lot of rules
But trust me like Chupty I refuse to lose
I used to crawl, but now I can walked
I used to babble, but now I can talk
I wear my Timbs, and go out on limbs
But as the next man sleep, I keep all the wins
Not even depressed, only showing progress
Paved the way and I say, nothing more, nothing less

I rap for listeners, bluntheads, fly ladies and prisoners
{*scratching*} For real, nothing more, nothing less

[Deda]
Imagine just living the good life
In the crib wit my kids on some shit wit my wife
Cause it really doesn't matter how large you live
A rapping champion, a company executive
Association brings about negotiation
Facing in a positive direction is a blessing
Cause boom, you can be Donald Trump and shit
And I can be me, just chilling feeling lovely
But if I could change the whole world in a instant
By saying some more magic tactic in a sentence
My people in the belly of the best will be released
My family and friends would have laughs at a feast
No more, no less in the flesh
Overqualified for the knock in your ride
Nothing but the best as we slide to the rest
Paved the way and I say, nothing more, nothing less

I rap for listeners, bluntheads, fly ladies and prisoners
{*scratching*} For real, nothing more, nothing less
Nothing more, for real, nothing less, for real
I rap for listening, bluntheads, fly ladies and prsioners</pre>
