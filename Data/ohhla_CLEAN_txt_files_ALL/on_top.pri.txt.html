Song:   On Top Bubble
Typed by: timmy.bogenburt@gmail.com

Go, go, ha, come on, come on

Unstoppable, undroppable, uncoppable, on top bubble
I'm a mad rapper, ripper, Ivy League stripper
Nike kicker, born winner, heavy hitter, heavy hitter
Unstoppable, undroppable, uncoppable, on top bubble
I'm a mad rapper, ripper, Ivy League stripper
Nike kicker, born winner, heavy hitter, baller

Rock star in a stock car, start a cock war, shock n awe
What you gonna do with your dropped jaw
you ain't seen a chick like this before, huh
Bad girl, big libido, got a man for every brand of Dorito
My ego got a lot of clones &amp; while you gettin' stoned
I'm on the ball kick kick life like a field goal

Unstoppable, undroppable, uncoppable, on top bubble
I'm a mad rapper, ripper, Ivy League stripper
Nike kicker, born winner, heavy hitter, heavy hitter
Unstoppable, undroppable, uncoppable, on top bubble
I'm a mad rapper, ripper, Ivy League stripper
Nike kicker, born winner, heavy hitter, baller

Ha, it's cool, my plan fool proof
No use to try to stop the grip of my tooth
Say what you want, my mind's soundproof like a vocal booth
The only thing I hear is my own voice and the music
Watch how I move your mouth to say the words that I wrote
Make you go broke till you gotta pay for these clothes
Simmer and soak in everybody's brain till the world's ready
A winner gettin' in my Range like oh, steady
Tear through written words, letters' my confetti
Takin' the world when your heads turned, you let me
So deadly, gettin' burned from the fire in my belly
You got me, baby, who needs any other celebrity, uh
My armies sell out arenas, we always rock Adidas
And everybody wanna meet us, born leaders
off the meters sittin' in our jet's 50 seaters
Get a touch of Jesus in your speakers
builders buildin' wings in my name at Mt. Cedars
Lingerie with leaders, body out the shell of Venus
And lifetime achievements can suck Soundscan's penis

Unstoppable, undroppable, uncoppable, on top bubble
I'm a mad rapper, ripper, Ivy League stripper
Nike kicker, born winner, heavy hitter, heavy hitter
Unstoppable, undroppable, uncoppable, on top bubble
I'm a mad rapper, ripper, Ivy League stripper
Nike kicker, born winner, heavy hitter, hevy hitter

Put the mic on and get your Nike on
Make me an icon, like the right one
Bite like a python, you'll be like damn that's a nice song
And I'm like yeah, and it's life-long
Start a chain reaction
I'm all talk but when I rock it's all action
Chickes get the chips, we gonna cash 'em
So rock on and check out my f-f-f fashion
You can't get no, satisfaction
You probably pay attention to the wrong crap, man
You oughta pay attention to my track, man
Everyone I meet is kinda, slackin'
I'm gonna rule the world with what I wrote on my napkin
Understand, hold the world in the palm of my hand
Superstar's gonna be the only name brand

Unstoppable, undroppable, uncoppable, on top bubble
I'm a mad rapper, ripper, Ivy League stripper
Nike kicker, born winner, heavy hitter, heavy hitter
Unstoppable, undroppable, uncoppable, on top bubble
I'm a mad rapper, ripper, Ivy League stripper
Nike kicker, born winner, heavy hitter
Shit kicker, politicker, malt liquor, time ticker
Slit zipper, gore tipper, door tripper, Yom kippur
Big titter, crate digger, high bidder, real singer
Big tipper, day tripper, thigh thicker, much quicker
Born kicker, born winner, heavy hitter, no beginner
No beginner, no beginner, no beginner, ballers</pre>
