Intro/Chorus

It's just the things that you do (5x)
The way you do the things you do

Verse 1

8:05 the alarm clock sounds
I grab my shoes and turn the damn thing down
But now it's 9 o clock I still ain't up yet
Work on time, yeah I admire the concept
You got me yearnin' and I'm anticipating
Seeing you I can't wait it's hard to concentrate
My mind is blind from all the time thinking of you
And the way you do the things you do

Chorus

I walk in the park for a midnight rendezvous
A slow dance, romance, promoted for see through
I wanna be with you
And I ain't hidin' it
A wave of love and I'm gliding and riding it
Things like that when you hear me say
Sort of sounds like that same old clich√©
Climb the highest mountain swim the deepest sea
But I can't front, I want you to want me
Cause baby when you grab me tightly
You send chills that tend to incite me
When you caress and fondle me lightly
Ah girl watch out cause you might be
Setting yourself up the way that you tease me
Cause sooner or later you're gonna have to please me
It's just somethin' about you
The way you do the things you do

Chorus

Now why oh why would an incredibly fly guy like me
Be chasing one lady
It's just somethin' about you
The way you carry yourself when you're out to
Seem to have a captivating style, I've parked the feelin'
But your whip is appealing
And since this is a subject I bought up
I might as well just admit that I'm caught up
It ain't the clothes you're wearing
Your perfume or the style that your hair's in
It ain't your body or how slim your waist is
Your new jeans or how pretty your face is
But I feel funny when in close proximity
Making me wonder what's gettin' into me
There's just somethin' about you
The way you do the things you do

Chorus

Bridge

It's the things that you do (2x)
The way you do the things you do

Verse 4

The mystery's solved this girl I ponder
Just sitting back letting my mind wonder
What da, why da, who da, how da hell does this young lady
Drive me so crazy
Deeply in thought pose like a thinker
I blow you a kiss or a wink or a smile just to show
There's somethin' about you
The way you do the things you do

The way you do the things you do

Chorus
(Repeat till fade)</pre>
