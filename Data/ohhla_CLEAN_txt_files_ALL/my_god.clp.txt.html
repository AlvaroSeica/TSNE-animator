[Pusha T]
I can't be bothered with paying homage to forefathers
See the future like the car show floor models
Both feet in the snow so that my core follows
We don't mourn for the dead nigga, we pour bottles
Drown sorrows, ocean blue Murcielagos
Started with similac powder in a baby bottle
Yeah, the formula is warning ya
Crack kills, offerings to the coroner
Kill my eldest brother? Nigga, I'd be damned
Gator at my momma house, welcome to zombie land
A hustler's paradise, a lucky pair of dice
Down forty, but a streak will have you square by night
Didn't bat an eye at it, kept the pokerface
cause the batter I add, it had the coca base
When you get to Heaven's door, they won't hold a space
If you numb like the flesh on a smoker's face
There's no feeling like your bitch +Chin-chilling+ right
You in Italian leather and you four-wheeling right
You know you up when you can count a quarter million right
and if you down, you can slang it like a pillow fight
I'm a wizard at it, nigga here's the magic
Make a small town feel I threw a blizzard at it
Get the green from the scale like a lizard had it
Bare witness as I unveil this instant classic

[Chorus]
Yes, my God
My God, my God
Yes, my God
My God, yes

[Pusha T]
Yeah, the second coming's in the second verse
The first coming still here so I'll need a hearse
I got a voodoo doll every time I pen the verse
Not only do they say they feel it but they say it hurts
No pain, no gain nigga
They say I'm heating up, welcome to the flame nigga
No matter the success, still the same nigga
I only change when the new body came nigga
Aerodynamic, roof panoramic
My credit score let the dealer take full advantage
Paid over sticker price, cash under handed
The 0-12 a year early, I'm a time bandit
Gotta time manage when you heaving snow
Able to drop it all at thirty and be free to go
Only deal with divas on a need-to-know
and what you need to know is when you need to go
There'll be no waiting, I have no patience
This is the end for all my unrecognized greatness
I'm here now nigga, pardon my lateness
You can hear in every bar and every cadence
Yeah, it's the new God flow ain't it
The Last Supper for you niggas now repainted
Take position on the chessboard and rearrange it
Face to face with the truth, get reacquainted

[Chorus]</pre>
