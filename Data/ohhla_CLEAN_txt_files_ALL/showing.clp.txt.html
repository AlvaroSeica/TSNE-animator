[Pusha T]
Hoe I'm major
That shit nothing
young nigga old money
Benjamin Button
Seeing through your poker face
That nigga bluffin, ladies going gaga for nigga trying to fuck em'
Nickel plate tuck it, hesitate nothing
And I got the A-R, why I like to bust it?
Why I need counseling?
Why I won't discuss?
Why I spend Donkey Kong knots in the mall like fuck it?
Pull up at the stop light, lookin at this cop like
Yeah I drive big shit, naw my license aint right
Still let the top drop back when it's sunny
Because life ain't nothing but bitches and money
 
[Chorus]
I don't know what is, but something inside
I need that attention I just can't hide
Keep hearing these voices inside my mind
Sayin fuck the rest, it's time to shine
I know that's how, the good ones died
But I need that risk, I need that drive
I'm stealin your bitch, I'm stealin yo' grind
Bitches sing this, and that's why I'm
Showin out little momma, showin out little daddy {*4X*}
 
[Yo Gotti]
Old school Chevy wide body like a phantom
5 stars love but them haterz can stand em
UK money 150 thousand pounds
All white liam standing low to the ground
I just joined the game, the millionaire boys club
Gave me box of baking soda and skate board
I'm in the kitchen putting the work on steroids
Peeking out the blinds for the feds, I'm paranoid
Naw I ain't platinum, but how I'm a millionaire?
I know this a four door, so how ain't no ceilin there?
Showing off little momma, going hard little daddy
Yo Gotti homeboy I'm a walkin dope package
 
[Chorus]

[Malice] 
I'm from the era, of letter to the better
They tell me rap change, well I'm a have to let her
Common loved her, I wish I never met her
They slutted her out, there's nothing left to treasure
Seems all I hear em say niggas, where them dollars at?
Here they go right here till them niggaz holla back
Hit it then I quit, then I step like a welcome mat
That 2010 got me feelin like I'm all of that
Re-up game trinity Liva, me and Pusha T
Got my money right, them haters tight like virginity
They don't understand how I feed off that energy
My table is prepared in the presence of my enemies
