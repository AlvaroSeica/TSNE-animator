[Intro: Tech N9ne]
Let's get it
Fredwreck, Robby Krieger, Ray Manzarek, John Densmore, Tech N9ne, and Mister Jim Moreson

[Hook: Jim M. &amp; Tech N9ne]
Strange days have found us
(I been a nobody, but now I get it in)
Strange days have tracked us down
(Nowhere to run, what I did is keep it wicked [?] pretend)
They're going to destroy
(Everything in my path I'm a gas I'm a spit it to the end)
Our casual joys
(I'm a take away your everything, I'm a merk [?] where I began)
We shall go on playing
Or find a new town
Yeah!

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
In the beginning it was negative, wasn't nobody [?] heavenly sick brethren
Tech's veteran, better than clever man
You're gonna be off of your rocker when the chakra's on chopper
It's kinda funny having no money coming up
It's the number independent 1 rapper, people running up
[?]
Beast in the nation, cheese generatin'
Now everybody know where the flame spray, fame pays, maintains brain crazed
Leaving them all leaking in pain
Hey gain, wait
Get ready for Strange Days

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
I told them I was gonna ball for y'all
Did it all, they didn't wanna get involved at all, yeah
They said that I was gonna fall, but now I'm walking tall
They all saw wicked [?] start here
Everybody will applaud the odd lyrical God
The fraud better kneel before his own, yeah
Never ever will I dissolve my heart in the dark, so when they call I'm a all a call, yeah
Wanna hate me
Industry gotta face me
They be shaky, ladies say we may be the crazies
They hella hazy, John Wayne the case be
The industry face off too sweet like pastry
Look at all these mentions
Look at all this ubratitions
Remember everyone saying I wasn't gonna make it, but the Tecca Nina kept on inchin'
This ain't no dang phase
Never will my reign fade
On the come up and a one up
Man it feels good to finally see Strange praised

[Outro: Jim M. &amp; Tech N9ne]
Strange days have found us
(This is the trip)
And through their strange hours
We linger alone
(The best part I, really really like)
Bodies confused
(6, 7, Tech N9ne!)
Memories misused
(Fredwreck. Thank you brotha)
As we run from the day
To a strange night of stone</pre>
