[Intro: Dungeon Masta]
Yeah... exclusive, Dungeon, nahimean?
I'm feeling real good right now, holla

[Chorus: Dungeon Masta]
Games that people play is foul (games that people play is foul)
You're feminine, still take a mile (you're feminine, still take a mile)

[Dungeon Masta]
You said you loved me, ain't no need to pretend
Your canal, got a nigga open, doing backspins
I want to be with you, spend some time with you
Alone when I'm not with you, don't know what to do
You know that wifey stress me out, no doubt
Should be alright as long as I dig her back out
And break out, no body had to know about ya little adventure
Put yo ass down and be my thirst quencher
Lay down them walls and let ya main frame fall
I be there for you, as long as you call
However I heard you wanna slang Eddie Kane for me
Your house is not my home (so) give up them keys
Don't got no time for mental games, now, please
Bring you up from rags to riches, certified dirty knees
Do what you gotta do, and it will be okay
If not, shorty, you got to bounce, gigga-go away

[Chorus 2X]

[Dungeon Masta]
Go girl, you got a black male game in ya
I like the way you freak that little black tail on ya
The reason that you wanna roll with my crew
Cuz nobody understands you, baby, like we do
No time to get emotional, now, true
As long as you bring some mens, and your friends will do
Must I seek revenge upon who (who)
That nigga that spread blood, blast that fool
It's gonna be a, hot time, living in the city
Look out, nigga, it's known represent, peep it
Tenth Chamber, deep, dark secret
If you, find a million dollars in the street, will you keep it?
See kids bugging off speech, will you speak it?
Having nightmares in the heat, when the slugs hit the meat
And cover the corps with the sheets
And wash away the chalk off the streets, complete

[Chorus 2X]

[Dungeon Masta]
Up to me, get you stoned in the hood, kids act grown in the hood
Heads get blown in the hood, bodies are thrown in the hood
Gangstas being shown in the hood, things being sold in the hood
Coward niggas, bold in the hood, heart got cold in the hood
Lost souls roam in the hood, dry mouth foam in the hood
Eyes, open wide in the hood, some stay inside in the hood
Some get money, ride in the hood, snakes in the garden, often hide in the hood
Some folks lie, even died in the hood
Haze stays high in the hood, real niggas known in the hood
Shorties being boned in the hood, niggas are clones in the hood
Kings get dethroned in the hood

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
