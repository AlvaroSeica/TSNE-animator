[Shawn Wigs]
I feel in love with my book, just me and my pen
I used to tattoo the pages, again and again
All night writing my jewels, it's like copping a Benz
Fuck my cell phone, big chain and all my friends
Every night in the studio, we spent time together
Kept you, close to my heart, under my Theodore leather
Never let no one touch you, or get you open
Kept my thoughts to myself, even though you felt broken
I was writing in them other books, you wasn't close
I even paid for loose leafs just to write notes
I'm a pig, all I do is just use these books
Drop slang, get my nut off and throw down hooks</pre>
