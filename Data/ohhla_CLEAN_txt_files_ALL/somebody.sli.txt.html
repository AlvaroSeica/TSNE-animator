Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Wait and see because you know you need somebody

I said, the loving you lost is just one of the costs
When you're living in the streets and you're running from cops
And everyday that's just the price you pay
When you're living by the words and the things you say

And if your mother only knew
That all these things you say you know are true

C'mon and, a little woman, yes the one you wanted
The type of woman leave you broken hearted
Got the type of body that you can't ignore
Said, you got a lot of money but you can't afford
A little loving from the wrong side
Of the bed, you sleeping for the long night

Wait and see because you know you need somebody
oh yeah, somebody, oh yeah, somebody, oh yeah

You're saying that you're leaving baby
I don't think that you're coming back
And nothing's meant to last forever
Let me know what you think about that
Cause taking time to think about it
Only means that you'll work it out
Said, thinking that you need her
And what it's all about, c'mon and

If your mother only knew
That all these things you say you know are true
And if you're thinking that you need someone new
You'll have to wait and see because you know you need somebody
Oh yeah, somebody, oh yeah, somebody, oh yeah</pre>
