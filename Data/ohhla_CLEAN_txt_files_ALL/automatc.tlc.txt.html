[Vic-E]
Au-to-matic
Doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo

Repeat above

[T-Boz]
I remember when I fell for you
It wasn't when I wanted to
But you were acting so into me
(Au-to-matic)

Went real good for a month or two
Just like every relationship
We gotta honor, trust too
And can't get it, baby

	[Chilli]
1 - 	I knew when you started to change
	We could never be the same
	I could do it when you do it to me
	(Au-to-matic)

	I knew if it came to be
	We would get a chance to see
	A side of each other
	That we both didn't know

	[All]
2 - 	What do you do to make me feel
	So good for so long
	Then take it back
	And expect me to be alone
	I feel you're cruel
	But if you're gonna do me wrong
	I'll get you back
	Baby that's just, just automatic

[T-Boz]
I remember when I met
The man with all the confidence
Every day was promises to me
(Au-to-matic)
Then you stepped way out of line
Cheat on me too many times
I'm tryin' put you down
On what comes around goes back around, yeah

Repeat 1

Repeat 2

What do you do
To make it feel so good, baby
Then take it back
And I wanted to be your lady
I feel you're cruel
But if you're gonna act crazy
I'll get you back
Baby that's just, just automatic

[Vic-E]
That's..Just...Au-to-matic

[T-Boz]
(What do you do)
That's just, just automatic
That's just, just
(Then take it back)
That's just, just automatic
That's just, just oh
(I feel you're cruel)
That's just, just automatic
That's just, just
(I'll get you back)
That's just, just automatic
That's just, just baby

(What do you do)
Doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo
(Then take it back)
Au-to-matic

Repeat above

Baby that's just, just automatic
