Song:   Perfect Couple
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

They were the perfect couple, they'd always lock lips
He gave her his heart, he said don't drop this
She looked him in the eye, and said I promise you
I'll replace it with mine and it's not gonna move
He'd always ditch his friends, he put their love first
But as he found out, that's when love hurts
She wasn't faithful, always out creepin' round
And she was never really there whenever he'd be down
But he never caught on he was caught up
Cause growin' up, he was never really taught love
His old man always did his mum the wrong way
And whenever they'd fight, he'd let a song play
So he told himself "fuck it I'll be different"
But little did he know by doin' that, he'd be distant
Cause his girl was always goin' out and gettin' high
But he loved her to much that he let it slide
He didn't understand why she would always make it hard
But he never spoke up, so they could make it last
And over time you could see it start to take a toll
It's like she got a kick out of tryna break his soul
But still he soldiered on puttin' on that brave face
Until the night he saw her gettin' with his best mate
His stomach dropped, as his chest started cavin' in
She gave his mate the same looks that she gave to him
He didn't say a word he just turned around
Cause every bridge they'ed ever built, she just burnt em down
He sent a subtle text, not knowing what's coming next
All he thought about was tyin that rope round his neck
He sat in his room talkin to his walls like
"No-one will miss me I'm sure that they'll be alright
I mean look at me, I can't even find hope"
Just before he stepped off and tied the rope
An hour passes no-body knows that he's gone
He's tensed up all white with a note in his palm
His girlfriend walks in and drops to the floor
But the note in his hand can not be ignored
Tears runnin' down her face and her make up
The first three words she read were "I hate love"
I saw everything I saw the look in your eye
But in a way it's alright cause we're born to die
Tell mum and dad that I'm sorry that it came to this
But I can't go on because I hate this shit
I hate the way you can do everything you please
And deep down you know I gave you everything you need
All the memories we made start to fade to black
And I know just like you I can't take this back
I also wrote you a song it's in your tape deck
And when we fucked I just wished it was safe sex
Cause I saw the positive on the stick you hid
But for all I know the kid could be his
So don't try and say I'm the one that fucked up
And I know your hearts breaking and it sucks huh
This is it though I'm runnin' out of time to write
But I'm goin' cause I felt like the time was right
And you should know that my very last thought was you
And there's pictures on my bed that I was sortin' through
I just wish when it came to us you would try
But this is it baby, Goodbye</pre>
