Yeahhhh, better back up off me
Nigga never no softy, boy I'll stop your heartbeat
While you out in the street yellin out what you finna do to me
In the middle of your speech I'ma sweep you off your feet to sleep
Fuckin with these thugs
Keep thinkin y'all don't bleed blood and I'ma make you a believer - pop pop!
What you receiver, a motherfuckin bullet from my automatic pistol
Hit you, him too, and all the rest of them niggaz that you got wit'cha
I'm collected and quiet, but surprise nigga, I get live
Jumpin up out of that rugged
Dump it, finna show these niggaz a little somethin
Reppin shit for Bone Thugs, nigga don't test mine to the redline
But like my Mo Thug niggaz say ball, show 'em the gunline (gunline)
Caught in the line of fire boy if you want to (yeah if you want to)
And a nigga gon' be on yo' ass like skunk's funk, pyew!
I grab my dick, let my nuts swing from my thang (swing from my thang)
If you's a anybody killa nigga, let the bullets rain
We be puttin 'em up straight
cause if you ain't, you done got into some shit
With the thuggish (thuggish) ruggish (ruggish) bloody murder clique

[Chorus: Krayzie Bone]
Comin to slay, fuckin 'em up with me gun gun blast
Comin to slay, fuckin 'em up with me gun gun blast
Comin to slay, fuckin 'em up with me gun gun blast
Comin to slay, fuckin 'em up with me gun gun blast

[Layzie Bone]
Undercover man, how you want it man?
I'm a fool on the loose with a gun in hand 
I got a sho' shot aim for the runnin man
that'll stop you in the tracks when I'm dumpin man
They did somethin man, niggaz talk real loud
Real fly out they mouth when you ain't around
Talkin like a nigga stole they style
When a nigga show up these niggaz bow down
Pound for pound from the shoulders
Nigga I'm the coldest, little soldier
Big niggaz are ruthless, how quick are you niggaz?
Believe I got somethin for ya
In the holster, in the bushes cocked
Up on the porch I got a gauge and glock
Corner to corner this thang on lock, yeah it's hot on this block
Nigga got everything short of cannons +Wild N Out+, but I ain't Nick Cannon
Nigga got M-11's, SR-15's and I plan to let niggaz have it
Fuck this rappin; if it come down to it nigga disrespectin what's happenin
My family, my money, my thugs, myself; my nigga I'm flat out blastin
Countin out caskets on you bastards smashin
If I'm ever forced to bring the action
I'ma ride down I'm pistol packin, we can definetly get it crackin 
Old fashioned like the wild west, Ghetto Cowboys, nigga '06
Fake niggaz and real niggaz in the real world just don't mix 

[Chorus]

[Wish Bone]
I'm a hundred proof, want a taste?
Take it to the head or the face, wrong place
You can do it, never been a sucka
Nigga runnin with a Thugger, not in the game
Nigga runnin with a Thuggish Ruggish in my range
Better do my damn thing and lift ya mayne
Bet you won't leave the same way you came, we soldiers tight
Put up your stripes we'll rip them off, slash somebody
Back with a attitude that's right
I'm sick with the money spent on bulletproof nigga fight, fight
Handle that, nigga handle that
Give back to the music, fuck that (fuck that)
Reach back, throw back, everybody in the car gotta lean back
See now the game was soft so we back, hit 'em in the head with a relapse
Younger than most of you niggaz so what? You die (you die) you die
If I decide then we ride, if it's on you rock-a-bye bye
Thuggstas straight up warned you; you will, obey mine 
Oh we will ride, yes we ride in the nighttime
It really don't matter, gettin high, yup in the daylight 
Thuggstas no fools, we know the rules, don't get too close with a attitude
Dude, cause ooh, won't like how I give it to you

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

Gun blast {*echoes*}
