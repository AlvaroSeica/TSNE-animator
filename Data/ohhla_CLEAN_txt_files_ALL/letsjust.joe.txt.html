[Joe]
You And Me Girl Its Just Right
So Why Do You Deny (How You Feel, Yeah Listen Girl)
You Should Be Up In My Arms At Night
And By My Side (Its The Way It Should Be, Now Listen)

Chorus 1
We Can Talk About This Forever
Or We Can Just Do What We Know Is Right
So Lets Just Move On Cause We Got Love To Make Ah
Lets Do This Tonight
Dont Put Up A Fight

Gotta Make You Believe That
You And Me Together Would Feel So Good
Best Believe It

I Know You Can See That
You And Me Together Would Feel So Good
Best Believe It
So Lets Just Do It

Baby You And Me Fit Hand In Glove
Im In Love
You're In Love 
Aint It Good To Be Here
All My Life Girl
Ive Been Searching For The Perfect One To Be With Me
Could You Be Her

Chorus 1 [Joe]

[Joe]
Oh Why Deny How You Really Feel Inside Cause
Baby All I Really Want To Do Is Love You
And I Swear That Its Gonna Feel Baby
Feel So Good

[Fabolous]
Now If You Be My B-A-B-Y
I Can Be Your P-A-P-I
I Need A Girl To J Me
Sorta Like Beyonce Did To Jay-Z
Kinda Like Janet J Did To JD
And Maybe You Can Do Fab
Maybe Baby Trying To Say We
Dont Feel Right In The Back Of That Maybe
Yeah, And They Want To Convince Me
That We Dont Look Good On The Front Of The Bentley
So Lets Just Do It
Dress Fresh To It
SF To It With The Necklace Through It
Wake Up In The Morning Eatin Breakfast To It
Or Keep Trying To Get Up On The Guest List To It
J-O-E And They Know Me
Keep Figures
Keep Niggas On The J O B Bitch Yeah 

Chorus 2 [Joe]
Gotta Make You Believe That
You And Me Together Would Feel So Good
Best Believe It

I Know You Can See That
You And Me Together Would Feel So Good
Best Believe It

Gotta Make You Believe That
You And Me Together Would Feel So Good
Best Believe It

I Know You Can See That
You And Me Together Would Feel So Good
Best Believe It

Lets Just Do It
