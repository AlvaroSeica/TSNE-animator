I remember when people used to break on me
Sayin' anything I do would never make money
And everything I do would always be wack
And every word they spoke, a knife in my back
I remember watchin' Evil Dead
At 4 o'clock in the morning every night all summer
Sittin' in the dark tryin' to game on hoes
For a chance to dip my thang dank in some nanny hole
I remember my first piece of ass
She lived in Detroit, she was white trash
But I fell in love like a big ol' fool
I remember drivin' that dumb bitch to night school
I remember the first time me and Jeremy gave weed a try
Oh, what a surprise
Bloodshot eyes
It's all a bunch of lies
We said it didn't work and we wasn't even high
I remember shit, but don't remember a lot
But I remember the house behind the parking lot
And I remember the first day I met Madrox
From then it was on like Kirk and Spock
And I remember all the people and the things they say
And I remember when I see em', they gon' die that day
And I remember when my mama said watch my back
And I remember who to look out for now in fact
I remember the first day that I hit the green weed
I remember that it's us against the world in need
And I can remember the very first girl that I fucked
And I can really remember how bad it sucked
And I can remember the day that I took that vow
To bring the world the wicked shit the way that I know how
And I remember all the shows and all the love we got
And I remember buyin' three for 25 at the weed spot
I remember me and Jeremy used to fight and shit
And I remember all the bites and busted lips
I remember enough to get by
If you feelin' what I'm sayin', throw your hatchet in the sky
Seasons change and summer turns to fall
Every minute of my life, I remember it all
Happy and sad
Good and the bad
Every day we spent and all the times we had
Seasons change and summer turns to fall
Every minute of my life, I remember it all
Happy and sad
Good and the bad
Every day we spent and all the times we had
Seasons change and summer turns to fall
Every minute of my life, I remember it all
Happy and sad
Good and the bad
Every day we spent and all the times we had
Seasons change and summer turns to fall
Every minute of my life, I remember it all
Happy and sad
Good and the bad
Every day we spent and all the times we had
Seasons change and summer turns to fall
Every minute of my life, I remember it all
Happy and sad
Good and the bad
Every day we spent and all the times we had</pre>
