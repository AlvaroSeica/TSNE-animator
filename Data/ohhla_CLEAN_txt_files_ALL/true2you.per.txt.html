[Promise]
I got flavour like a taste test that I test that was hot
Like a pair of Nike Air, I'm fresh out the box
I'm out, fly a kite, I want that high life
Go get a Diet Sprite, 'cause I want that limelight
Tired of labels trying to label what I sound like
You sound nice, well what would you do for a Klondike?
I tell 'em, "I might speak over these beats with a passion"
They say "alright, can we get piece of the action?"
But I don't wanna sign your, your dotted line,
For the dollar sign, get it? Bottom line
I wanna be me, I do what I do
With my CD, I am the best with Haikus
I'm blessed like "achoo", excuse my flu
Ain't nobody but me spittin' sicker than I do
With minimal efforts, my records Jive like Clive do
Dude, I had a voice since Royce was 5'2"

[Naya Marie - Chorus]
Sometimes the dream chase is a maze
My feet on the ground, don't lose faith
Never let them cloud who I am to you baby
I'm true to you baby
Gotta hold it down, no matter what they say, no
Take me as I am, there ain't no other way, no
I know you know who I am to you baby
I'm true to you baby
 
[Dan-e-o]
Hey yo, isn't it a bit lame? Dan-e-o ain't hit fame
Such a big shame, he ripped the sickest lyrics lips made
He still spits? Wait, can you get him on my mixtape?
Daniel's an animal Bob Barker wanted to get spayed
It's late! What you call a hit, I call a disgrace
Got a sixth sense about it, look at this face
He must be joking, don't he want his talent on display?
He'll never make it at this rate, kids hey!
Let me tell y'all little suckers something 'bout a simple fact that I rap like a fashion show
When you ask "how so?", my answer throws analogies going from fast to slow
See I design styles that run way out of your minds kids
Get it? If not, rewind it, you'll find it
I'm BP with it, my slick flow cannot be stopped
Put it down for my team like you shot and I hockey blocked
Your talk is flop, no one is colder with music
I mindlessly attack rappers like Bush told me to do it!

[Naya Marie - Chorus]
Sometimes the dream chase is a maze
My feet on the ground, don't lose faith
Never let them cloud who I am to you baby
I'm true to you baby
Gotta hold it down, no matter what they say, no
Take me as I am, there ain't no other way, no
I know you know who I am to you baby
I'm true to you baby
 
Gotta hold it down, no matter what they say, no
Take me as I am, there ain't no other way, no
I know you know who I am to you baby
I'm true to you baby</pre>
