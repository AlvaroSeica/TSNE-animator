[answering machine]
(beep) Then you know what you can do
You can be a couple of pleasers
And take some tweazers
And bust every hair on my nutsack
Paste em to your back
Then jump on the E-Track
And suck my dick exactly where it's at....HO
(beep)

[old record plays]
Jay fuzz the clown 
Jay fuzz the clown
Jay fuzz the clown

[low voice repeats]
Juggles
Juggles
Juggles
Juggles (x2)

[low bass starts in background]

[Verse 1-Violent J] (crowd in parentheses)
Hey, Hey it's the wicked jokers
and we're coming to the valley and we'll smoke ya (choke ya)
Kick the clown in the forehead and I'm juggling juggling your head
(Jed) You big fat redneck mounty ass hick
I'm a city slicker and I'm come to the valley and I'm gonna hit ya
and ya know the carnival's gonna get wit' ya
Oh, I meant as well mention, that I come from another di-men-sion
You never seen nothing like this boy (Magic acts of pain and joy)
Please don't try to come and get me
Because I pack a French curler with me
And them punks are gonna have to take me out quick
Because I can do a  double-flip you fat piece of shit
Picture that (that) packing a magic wand and a top hat
Because some gotta stop or the wicked clowns are gonna chop, chop

[Chorus]
Swing, Swing, Swing, and Chop, Chop, Chop
Swing, Swing, Swing, and Chop, Chop, Chop
Swing, Swing, Swing, and Chop, Chop, Chop
Swing, Swing, Swing, and Chop, Chop [X2]

[Verse 2-Violent J] (Crowd in parentheses)
Detroit air is toxic, my eyeballs popped out they sockets
And fried in the streets like a sick em 
[sound of popping and a splatter]
(stick em, pick em)
Break em off something from the smokestack
I've been breathing all my life so I'm dying anyway
I'm nothing but a radiation freak show
My arm fell of and it bounced on the floor
Carnival land up the alley (alley, alley)
Then we landed in Sunny Valley
(Jumpin up and down on a richies head)
And now I'm gonna jump till he's finally dead
(Jump, Jump, Jump, Jump, Jump, Jump, Jump, Jump)
They got no love yet we got control
They'll never touch my funky soul
Street top all extra top
Now we can run or we can walk
Either way some gotta stop
Or the wicked clowns are gonna chop, chop

[Chorus]

[Verse 3-Esham and Violent J]

[Esham]        Wicked Clown, Wicked Clown
[Violent J]    What's up comes down
[Esham]        Before my nuts go soft juggle em around
[Violent J]    Bitch wanna join the carnival circus 
               grab my ding-a-ling and jerk and jerkus
[Esham]        I gotta catch these carnival thrills rudeboy (*mixed*)
               and these heads I drill
[Violent J]    Chills, thrills, bigots writing wills 
               an axe to the forehead usually kills
[Esham]        
If this ain't hell, I can't tell, hang my body on a cross with some 
rusty nails
If I juggle then call me a juggla, I'm a nap rubbla, voodoo smuggla
See I got the symptoms of insanity, I'm down with J from the ICP
I'm down with him and he's down with me
So if we gotta chop see H-O-PE

[Violent J]
Running down the block someone hit me wit' a rock 
And my brains all over the street
But I'm a wicked clown and I'm up and down all over this Esham beat

[Esham]
So, so, so if I gotta chop, then I guess I gotta chop
If I chop, then I gotta chop, chop

[Both]
But you could never stop sucker, you could never drop
Wicked clowns 'cause you know we love to CHOP, CHOP

[Chorus] (x2)

*in background*
Got to be funky
