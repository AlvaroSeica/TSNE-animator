[Intro]
WOLF GANG~!!

[Hodgy Beats]
Gold chain and some J's, like Nas in +Illmatic+
I'm so real, I'm somethin to feel, peel fabric
My folks kill, they hunt every meal, meat cabbage
Lyrically get out my way, protein, the beats radish
Roll the weed LB, the police smell me
High profile suite, bring them hoes to the telly - NOT!
Bitches fuck yo' shit up worse from DMX in +Belly+
Behind you back plannin your downfall, I thought that was yo' relly
Relative, skin her ribs and eat healthy
I belch a bitch and leave her tits on the shelfing
I felt a bitch, she let me in, welcoming
Fuck duct tape nigga, I like Velcro-ing
I ain't the one to be tampered with
I make you shit all in your pants and your Pamper, bitch
Niggaz quick to sing a hook and make a dance up quick
For you it's never or never, my camp's legit

[Interlude]
Wolf Gang! Fuck yo' crew, nigga!
This Wolf Gang, nigga!
Go the fuck home, nigga! Night night, motherfucker!
Smoke up, Left Brain

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Snow so white, moon so bright
They're on a, playground makin canines fight
Ain't no place for my kids to go

[Hodgy Beats]
The wolves are rowdy in the parking lot
I don't mean basketball when I say that they be ballin in the park a lot
It's like the big bad wolf duplicated
If they gettin shitted on by critics, it's cool they're super rated
Life on the huger playlist, daily's the fuckin basis
Accountin for all the hatred, get off the children's sacred
I'm international, actual, but in fact I go
from the US to the UK to Amsterdam in like 2 days

[Chorus]
