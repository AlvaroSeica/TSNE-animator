Song:   Victory Is In My Clutches
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I wanna thank ya
For bein so fly (so fly)
You didn't know (didn't know)
That it was my time
They shoulda told ya
I am for the people
And on my shoulders
Carrying the world
Say it sir victory is mine oh yeah

I tumble like the dice do
Stay on the humble like christ do
Piss stanzas and shite haikus
Since I was a young tyke-u
Tried to moonwalk like michael
I understood the universal cycles
Positive negative neutral
Impoverished kids on sedativesll live mutual
Where reverends, presidents movies stars cinema-togra-phers
And producers, so standardized eduacation in it's current state
Is useful, I'm mean useless
Pardon the slippage
The deadll probably target the jargon as gibberish
Meanwhile I'm off in the stars war'n with iblis
You see them atoms spinnin
You see them waves shimmering
You see them wisdoms grinning
The masculine energy make em feel feminine
I transformed and start assemblin
From moab to mendin
Sittin bull is twistin sittin ducks like dutches
Victory is in my clutches
Motherfuckers

You can't touch this like hamm and them
I'm on auto pilot
Sippin pen noir
Eatin sal-a-mon
Brother with foul in them
The son of marilyn
Chancellor of hope
Sharp like razor
Clean like soap
The simplest metaphors be the dope
They stumblin outta focus
I spit that hocus pocus
Man these niggas absolutely bogus
The cockroach flow is hopeless
I'm on they ass like locust

In and out the studio
The flows unruly so
My attack level is way higher than yugiohs
My defence level is in the trillions
So if you wanna duel
Ya rocket better be filled with fuel
Cause when you get here, I'll be on the stool crackin booze
And you'll be tired from the journey
So how you think that you could ever burn me
Man these wack niggas don't concern me
Bring out the gurneys and summon my attorneys</pre>
