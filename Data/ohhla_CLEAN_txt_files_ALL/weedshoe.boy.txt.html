Song:   Weed Shoes
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I just wanna smoke weed and buy shoes
And do it fly guys do
I just wanna smoke weed and buy shoes
And do it fly guys do
Stacks on there, there we straight, wake up everything
Get that cake
Stacks on there, there we straight, wake up everything
Get that cake

Back in don't need the cash to borrow but these days
Maserati and the murcielago, crash the benz ? couple another tomorrow
Or maybe get the ferrari 360 ? gallardo
You know I'm soulja, even bad?
Not too many ? that you can name ?
80 thousand... in the locker that was back then
I took off on them haters ain't a back since

I just wanna smoke weed and buy shoes
And do it fly guys do
I just wanna smoke weed and buy shoes
And do it fly guys do
Stacks on there, there we straight, wake up everything
Get that cake
Stacks on there, there we straight, wake up everything
Get that cake

Well check the mix tape ? I'm on fire man

Just caught the ? bottom from iron man
.. scoop the chick real quick she like the tires man
She be ? for the ? supplier man
New kicks new t, I dress proper man
Ask her if she got them, and she said that she forgot her man
He did what? tell them that I'm not a fan, soulja proper ?
And yeah I got a lot of fans, everythang goes from ? to the malibu
We can go east stay chilling on south ?
And if you wanna go you can be with me
Smoke weed play 360
Everywhere I go you could take... with me
Over seas man you can take that trip with me
Make a stop in flight club... kicks with me
Inhale till the bag's empty

I just wanna smoke weed and buy shoes
And do it fly guys do
I just wanna smoke weed and buy shoes
And do it fly guys do
Stacks on there, there we straight, wake up everything
Get that cake
Stacks on there, there we straight, wake up everything
Get that cake [x2]</pre>
