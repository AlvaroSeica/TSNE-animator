[Verse 1: Fred The Godson]
Free Mo, feds had to free Jason
Early 90's uncle free basin'
Mid 90's Pippin had to beat Mason
The bricks were fire, colors annihilating
And now applied the supply feeds tide wavin'
Anything aching up, had a lot of waking
Think to take the cut wonder what's the buyer making
Tank top, one bedroom, the pie is bakin'
Sitting here waiting, soda wet, cocaine cowboy, Aikman, Novacek
I'm on a strip while he cook a key
I load up half of clips, what up pusha T (warrup pusha)
Tell Malice I got that Khaled: the best
Send the fiend to the moon, alice
I'm moving that Ralph Cramden
Raise the price of the grams then

[Hook: Fred The Godson]
Shit, maybe I'm just like my pops
Maybe them birds will make it off the block
But, this is what it sounds when doves fly
This is what it sounds when doves fly
Maybe I'm just like my mother
Maybe I'm making whip and butter, I'm from the gutter
This is what it sounds when doves fly
This is what it sounds when doves fly

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
Tell them rock-a-by baby like a lullaby
Watching prince turn to king like when doves cry
Purple rain almost had me in the mug shot
Purple top I was selling out my drug spot
One stop shop had a special knock knock
We stepped on every square shit was hop scotch
We was young, we ain't care we make the block hot
The first Benz I ever bought was from a chop shop
Had a different V.I.N. shit was different then
BBS is on a bitch gave her a different spin
Turn 2 in a 5 with a different blend
My Panamanian connect had a different skin
Fast forward to the present day
Money tie ho down like the Chevrolet
Every block another notch upon my resume
Now I'm getting rap money with the better Ye

[Hook: Fred The Godson]
Maybe I'm just like my pops
Maybe them birds will make it off the block
But, this is what it sounds when doves fly
This is what it sounds when doves fly
Maybe I'm just like my mother
Maybe I'm making whip and butter, I'm from the gutter
This is what it sounds when doves fly
This is what it sounds when doves fly

[Verse 3: Fred The Godson]
They came for the candy
That's why I got work in the telly Like Jamie and Fancy
Beretta in the leather from the Manci
Connect the city crab fish she put together with some scampi
Some niggers selling halfs for ten, it can't be
Been on the block way too long, I'm Marcus Camby
Tints on the Camery, hand to the boondocks
Came a long way from 12-12's in the tubes socks
Heard a story about someone starting with 2 rocks
2 years later, he carrying 22 blocks
I had to stash near the boiler, night time playing the moon, a Houston Oiler
Or the? to ya, had this diesel fiend, tying up both of his arms, ultimate warrior
My connect's friend get it from the border
They reservoir dogs, I just get end up with the water

[Hook: Fred The Godson]
Maybe I'm just like my pops
Maybe them birds will make it off the block
But, this is what it sounds when doves fly
This is what it sounds when doves fly
Maybe I'm just like my mother
Maybe I'm making whip and butter, I'm from the gutter
This is what it sounds when doves fly
This is what it sounds when doves fly</pre>
