Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
The four-one done, another one rolled up
I don't sip lean, but baby girl pour it up
Baby doll, I met her in H-Town
Counting paper like mine, baby girl a gold mine, fo' sho'
We can take it all over in no time
Bake up cake and go lay up, that's no lie
She like damn homeboy, you really living out your rhymes
I'm like yeah, that other shit ain't rap, that's fairy tales
I'm showing my flow, show, sea shells
Drug dealer fortress, got this from legal retail
Sitting on the porch, cone lit, flipping the torch
Seconds later after that I'm sitting in the Porsche
With the racing exhaust, I take your bitch away from you
She take some days off, I put them jams on, she take her clothes off
She perform for a Jet, put on for our set, I roll up the next

[Chorus: Lloyd]
Purple haze, and codeine
And my baby girl, is all I need
Number nine, I'm on the fly
And I'm feeling so high, [?] don't pull me down

[Verse 2: Trinidad James]
She pick me up and took me on a trip that I've never been
And when she looking up, baby girl I'm going in
She say, no-oh-oh, but I know you ain't shit
Your whip is just a slave ship, and I'm not no bitch to play with
You better watch your [?] play
I laughed when I took her back [?] serious
Cause her heart is very cold, and the warmth up in her soul
You ain't getting you no money? I say damn you broke
You ain't getting you no money? I say damn you broke
You ain't getting you no money? I say damn you broke
These riches never change, only the souls
They will leave you in the rain, no raincoat
She said she met Spitta, I guess the plane caught
[?] sweater, and the weed I bought
Play my heart, lay my heart
Play my heart, I had to let you know

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Lloyd]
Oh, kush got me gone
Feeling so high, got me so blown
And the shit that I'm on, is cloud number nine, but six be my song
Twenty-one guns, kissing on my lips, blowing smoke in my lungs
Twenty-one drums, the heat's on my side in case a nigga want some
But I don't wanna fuss or fight, I just wanna chill tonight
On this Jet Life, Life, Life
Drop a little pink in my Sprite
Pop another pill and take flight
On this Jet Life, Life, Life

[Chorus]</pre>
