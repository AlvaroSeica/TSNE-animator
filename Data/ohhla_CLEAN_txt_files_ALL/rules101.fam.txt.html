[Timbo King]
Rule number one, never let a label see you stressing
Follow my directions, on these industry lessons
Two, keep a straight head for you meetings
Looks are deceiving, cuz crooks, they be beating
Three, copies of your tape is a no-no
Cuz niggas make promos, and sell your shit for dolo
Four, before you get jerked, learn the business
Surviving in this game of snakes, is very thin less
Five, negotiate a deal with the proper figures
Cut off the middle man, fuck with only real niggas
Six, let ya lawyer fix broken clauses
Your first option, date to get paid, pro rate it
Seven, I'm here to school all stupid fools
Individuals, niggas want residuals
Eight, concentrate, study legal terms
On the real, stay away from all evil firms
Nine, ask for all and musician funds
Blood suckers of the poor, this how this business runs
Ten, I'm giving you the information
One through twenty, Royal rules and regulations

[Hook x2: Timbo King]
You know the rules...

[Timbo King]
Yo, eleven, an album deal can be very tricky
Speaking with experience, two labels tried to stick me
Twelve, you gotta sell a whole lot of units
I'm business minded, here to teach all students
Thirteen, advance money is recoupable
Breach of contract, loopholes are very suitable
Fourteen, try to start a bidding war
No matter what, you'se a write-off, so what you signing for?
Fifteen, star status is so surprising
Make sure you get all rights on merchandising
Sixteen, avoid silly allegations
Kickback, side deals, kills your reputation
Seventeen, this advice is important
Bullshit politics down to extortion
Eighteen, don't let your dreams get deleted
Without the Royal rules, your career is uncompleted
Nineteen, incentives slash percentage
Money back, guaranteed, hell no, he spent his
Rule twenty, keep it focused on consistence
Take care of yours, when it comes to this business
