Take it back to the days when we raised us up
'Fore coward-ass rap made the game corrupt
P-Dog in the cut back to bring the pain
Puttin' wood on they ass can't stand the rain
And bring heat over beats, and scratch the itch
In a no spin-zone fuck a scanadalous bitch
It's the return of the Bush Killa back to bust
Just us for the justice, In God We Trust
I rush truth to the youth - and shine the light
Take the red pill, open up ya eyes to life
In this land of these crack fiends sheep and moles
See us overthrow the hold of this devil control
And roll deep - (keep it underground for the streets)
I'm the last cell - (hit em outta bounds, retreat)
We like ants in this war dance, if one falls
Ten more's in his place to advance the cause, it's all

Raw shit
HELL YEAH
It's the raw shit
HELL YEAH
Do you want the raw shit?
HELL YEAH
Everybody Sayin'
That's the Bomb -(what?) That's the Bomb
Gotta have the raw shit
HELL YEAH
Comin' with the raw shit
HELL YEAH
Do you need the raw shit?
HELL YEAH
Everybody Sayin'
That's the Bomb -(come on) That's the Bomb

I bust a shot and these pigs all dash like renta cops
These punk ass devils'll never stop
Fuck 'em all, I draw, they fall
Bitch, I was raw, ballin' back in the days of yes y'alls
Gotta make a fuss, nigga bust an' ride
See it in my eyes, speak truth or die
Amerikkka's the motherfuckin' beast and I'm
Still the same, nigga snatchin' sheets for mine
Back on the map, and we fade to black
Fuck rap, see us pickin' off pigs with straps
And bust on they compound, take control
Of the precinct, leave 'em all stank an' cold
It's no justice no motherfuckin' peace, say it
No justice no motherfuckin' peace, believe
Long as niggas gettin' beat by these pigs we shoot
Outta coupes - fuck peace and the boys in blue, we do the

Raw shit
HELL YEAH
It's the raw shit
HELL YEAH
Do you want the raw shit?
HELL YEAH
Everybody Sayin'
That's the Bomb -(what?) That's the Bomb
Gotta have the raw shit
HELL YEAH
Comin' with the raw shit
HELL YEAH
Do you need the raw shit?

That's the Bomb -(come on) That's the Bomb

To protect and to serve is a myth to us
They protect they shit and serve sticks to us
Fuck a waterhose nigga, those days is thru
All a pig's gotta do nowadays is shoot
But who police the police when they
Beat brothers to the ground like - everyday
What I'm sayin', what if niggas start shootin' 'em back?
Spit caps outta gats 'till the beast collapse?
With an eye for an eye, ain't no time to play
With an eye for an eye - it's the Amerikkkan way
Do it big see the jig split wigs of foes
Bust shots at these pigs - nigga dig the flow and
Hear us all say power to the people combined
Hold court in the streets 'till these pigs comply
Niggas got no choice but to ride or die
Put this beast on it's back - genocide's the plight, we bring the

Raw shit
HELL YEAH
It's the raw shit
HELL YEAH
Do you want the raw shit?
HELL YEAH
Everybody Sayin'
That's the Bomb -(what?) That's the Bomb
Gotta have the raw shit

Comin' with the raw shit
HELL YEAH
Do you need the raw shit?
HELL YEAH
Everybody Sayin'
That's the Bomb -(come on) That's the Bomb
