[Tech N9ne]
When you see me smilin'
I'm really frownin'
You think you really wilin'
I'm killa klownin'
Meaning I don't give a fuck about nothin'
You say that you do because stupid
Is how everybody soundin'

Niggah you think you know me
But only if you knew me homie
You leave me by my lonely
I'm thinkin' death and destruction
Imagez of blood n pus and
I ain't lookin' for nothin' but trouble
Thinkin' of murderin' you when I'm just loungin'

That's just the devil (just the devil)
Block it out and keep it movin'
I'm evil and this pussy that I'm pursuin'
Gimme the bible yes I need it
Cuz tecca nina'z in ruin
Mentally I'm fuckin' up when I really don't know what I'm doin'
My tolerance for physical pain is gained rapidly
I'm gobblin' more thizzlez than thangz but it came back at me
The holy father musta flipped and became mad at me
Because I'm ponderin' a wicked insane strategy

How to end it all?
Many men will fall
And he sent us all
Ninna been involved
You don't really want it wit me punk you don't have the gall
It takes the blood on my tongue to get me wanna brawl
No sentimental shit
Death is the penalty for any bitch who try to rekindle this that'll get ya temple hit
bout to bubble about to pop just like a pimple get
Sin is somethin so insane I'm so not for simple shit

So teeter tatter motha fucka if you wanna but just keep it to the left of me
Crazy till the death of me
Pussy money mo money blood and guts is the recipe
Havin hella drama for ninna is a neccessity
Good and bad is fightin within me and I'm the referee
Shit its lookin like evil is gettin the best of me
Bitches think I'm pleasant and really wantin the sex with me
I promise you I'm losin it you no really wanna mess wit me

[Chorus: Big Krizz Kaliko]
You don't wanna see me run up wit the thang (cock back)
Make the trigga bang bang (You don't wan it wit me)
If you don't really want it niggah (fall back)
Cuz to killas it ain't never been a thang (You don't want it wit me)
And I can give em to ya if you feel u really want it one of us ain't gonna make it out (You don't want it wit me)
I'm kinda sick and psycho crazy feelin like I'm michael push it You'll see what I'm talkin bout (You don't want it wit me)

[Mr. Reese]
Betta load up ya drums, load up ya guns, everybody better get to runnin you don't want it with me
I'm a lyrical cynical rippin ya pinnacle, damage anybody when I see they really want it with me
Techa-ninna told me nigga get money and never been dumby shit on a nigga when he comin funny with me
Follow the beat follow your feet gimme the weed keys g's and a quarter pound of bullets with a machete
Mister reese known for getting it poppin you niggas be droppin and when you do your albums be floppin
When ever I spit it and better yet when ever I drop it your wife is gone cop it she even tell you nigga go cop it
You don't want it with me
I'll fuck your life up like a disease
I'm hauntin your dreams with a fully auto choppa them beams
Mayne yadadamean
Ya life ain't shit but a dream so just remember when your breathin you don't want it with me

[Chorus: Big Krizz Kaliko]
You don't wanna see me run up with the thang, (cock back) make that chicka bang bang
You don't want it with me
If you don't really want it nigga (fall back) 'cause to killas it ain't never been a thang
You don't want it with me
And I can give it to ya if you feel you really want it one of us ain't gonna make it out
You don't want it with me
I'm kinda sick and psychopathic feelin like a michael push it you'll see what I'm talking bout
You don't want it with me

[Prozak]
And you don't want it from me
See I'm believing that people are really angels and demons instead of human beings
I'm havin feelings of wanting to be the cause of you bleeding causin your family to be grieving now your soul is leaving
Entered in my mind the raw holy words and religious battles keep 'em mutilated like cannibal over serpent rattles
I'm seeing shadows and bodies swingin from gallows as I'm sitting in a circle surrounded by seven candles
My eyes rolls back, I speak in tongues, I bleed from gums, it's time to hit the streets with guns
I'm bustin seventy shots laughin as the people run, I plead to be free from these evil deeds I've done
Until the pain coincides with my violence and agony, oh the humanity, why does he keep stabbing me
But it's me that I'm stabbing, it's self-inflicted wounds, the hitch-cock of hip-hop and it's comin soon.

[Chorus: Big Krizz Kaliko]
You don't wanna see me run up with the thang, (cock back) make that chicka bang bang
You don't want it with me
If you don't really want it nigga (fall back) 'cause to killas it ain't never been a thang
You don't want it with me
And I can give it to ya if you feel you really want it one of us ain't gonna make it out
You don't want it with me
I'm kinda sick and psychopathic feelin like a michael push it you'll see what I'm talking bout
You don't want it with me</pre>
