[Kreayshawn]
I got strawberry letter 27
I got gold bananas engraved
With my grandmothers title signature
What you got?
I got me a bunch of haters
Got me a bunch of faders
Be like sayonara see ya laterrr
Jordan's on with the 808 drum
And you bitches can't get none, I'm just so done
Don't say shit though, say you know? No one know you
I'm in your city like a mayor ho, I lead by example
Your ho lives by dismantel
Don't tell a soul what we did just keep it stable
I'm dope, you're on dope
Get it?
Run and get the phone and you can't call for better
I was on the phone tellin' bitches that I'm wetter
I killed it once, I killed it twice and no I don't regret it

[Chorus]
What u doin'? Do just what you do
You like it and then you love it Alright
Do just what you do
What u doin'? Do just what you do
You like it and then you love it Alright
What u doin'? Do just what you do
You like it and then you love it Alright
What u doin'? Do just what you do
You like it and then you love it Alright
Do just what you do Alright

[Kid Cudi]
Lookin to trip, not really just lookin' for clues
I'm so important that when I buy shoes it's news
Custom perches might make bitches take off their shoes
How could I not, if I didn't then I wouldn't be scott
Broken hearted it slowly rots, I hope she knows that hardees sucks
I'm goin back up, don't summon me again unless your ready for the pain
You better step up, when you see me in the box, believe ib ball mayne
Mags on mags on mags I don't have to push motherfucker whos bad
Don't give a fuck about much, I'm cool and calm just like my dad
Niggas wanna live like us, niggas wanna floss like us
Fuck a bitch good like us, cool the cartier like us
Cruise all night with me, niggas really in paris

[Chorus]

[Kreayshawn]
I be on that power
Maybe on that powder
All these bitches yeah thay my bastards
They my bastards
They my bastards
Tell Ron Hubbard 50, I'm like WTF!
Outside raining kitties, my doctor knows whatup!
I be provin' last dance, I'm the only one
In hte sky high shinin' demon like the fuckin' sun
Throw my shades now I'm off on a world tour
Get less but a mind wanna give more
Boom boom for my girls on the dance floor
Pour some for the people, they work hard
Closer than her body, she's throwin a big party
She's inviting Cudi, we beat it 'til it's bloody

[Chorus]</pre>
