[Greg Nice]
Yeah yeah, that's right, it's us
Yeah yeah, that's right, it's us
Yeah, fly girls get up, and shake yo' butt
Yeah, yeah
Get up, get up, uhh, and shake yo' butt
Hey, get up get up get up get up get up

[Breadkdown: uncredited singer - repeat 2X]
Hey ladies, Nice &amp; Smooth is in the house
And you know they turn the party out
Ladies, I can't wait

[Chorus: Greg Nice]
Hey yo same old brand new style
From "Junkies," "Jewel of the Nile"
Ah don't urk the nerves, make us reach in the files
We got joints by the piles
We got the same old brand new style
It's the "Junkies," "Jewel of the Nile"
Ah don't urk the nerves, make us reach in the files
We got joints by the piles

[Greg Nice]
Aiyyo Libby Libby Libby on the label label label
Records in the crate behind the turntable
Time for us to throw shit up on the table
Hear me on the radio, see me on the cable
Head banger booty banger, rap singer
Don't got no time to be the gunslinger
To negativity you give the middle finger
Got the black Lear jet inside my hanger
Smooth B, so sharp up like a singer
Catch me at the body shop, Auric Goldfinger
Check it out, check it out
This is how we turn it out

[Chorus] - second half

[Smooth B]
Smooth B, at the top of the mountain and still climbin
Never stop, for pressure makes diamonds
Call me late at night, perfect timin
Visionary, five years ahead when I'm rhymin
Thoughts, deeper than those that sparked Plato
Holdin me, is like tryin to hold a tornado
Say word - word, you'll get mashed, like potato
I'll beat you like Bruce, when he turned into Cato
Who be the winner?  The snake or the monkey
Hard to tell but this beat, this shit is funky
I smoke chunky, I'm no flunky
My lyrical flow will knock needles out of junkies

[Breakdown] - one half

[Greg Nice]
The bass be kickin, the high-hat hissin
The snare be smackin, dough keep stackin
Bought a Lo-Jack in case of car jackin
Check me out as I bring it from my 'phragm
Peace to Funkmaster, peace to Crazy Sam
Puff a whole Owl, never sniff a gram
Style sticky like indo, tight like a clam
Greg N-I-C-E, my name ring bells
Make MC jail it ain't hard to tell
Threw a hundred dollar bill in the wishin well
You owe me a Grammy like Patti LaBelle
You owe me a Grammy like Patti LaBelle

[Breakdown] - 3X to fade
