[Chorus - 2x] 
Memories (of my niggaz in the penitentiary) 
Memories, of living on these streets 

[Gotti] 
Memories of me and my nigga, in the penitentiary 
Writing letters, making plans for once we hit society 
And how living's suppose to be 
Now my nigga dead in the cemetery, Lord tell me 
How could this be, you took my only friend away from me 
Left me alone in these streets, and smoking weed 
To keep my mind off the pain, I never let your name die in vain 
I represent, so you can live through my veins 
Guide me through this game, cause it's hard to maintain 
Most of these niggaz act strange, who's to blame 
I never rested tell murdered the killers, who caused your death 
Got me watching my back, I never know what to expect 
Is it my last breath, that's the questions I ask 
This life done got me pressured and strapped 
Watching my mama, fall into a wreck 
Lord can you hear me, because I'm feeling like I'm next 
It's kinda hard, not celebrating our birthday together 
I guess heaven is better 
Wesley Penn and Kevin Miller, memories forever 

[Chorus - 2x] 

[P'heno] 
Memories got me drinking Hennessy, to drown my misery 
Missing my peers who doing years, in penitentiaries 
Made it from the dark side, but still it's do or die 
Now will I survive this gamble with my life, falling my stripes 
So many homies, lost they life in the flames 
Or they die, by the poison in they veins 
Heavenly father give me strength, because I'm losing my faith 
This is the right path to take, don't wanna make a mistake 
And be a victim like my nigga Lester, Lord bless the boy 
Cause he having it hard, locked down behind bars 
To all my niggaz, doing time in the pen 
I'ma see ya when I see ya, I'ma see ya when they shut me in 
But until, I be breeder till they bury me 
And keeping niggaz in my memory 

[Chorus - 2x] 

[Regginelli] 
I'm having memories of my uncle, laying dead on these streets 
Lord help me I can't believe, that my nigga deceased 
This world is getting kinda hectic, got us niggaz dressed in black on black 
Looking for the nigga, that put a slug in my uncle back 
Remember when I wanted to be down, you bitches wasn't around 
Now I'm handling bidness, trying to put my fucking thang down 
These hoes, use to act funny 
But now they see me counting G's by the fucking hundreds, I'm getting money 
Memories, of my niggaz out there balling for keeps 
Some in the cell with an L, never gon' see the streets 
But that's ok I'm reminiscing, for my niggaz that's gone 
But for you Wesley I'm gon' holla, when I make you get home 

[Chorus - 2x] 

[Melchior] 
Now I'm reminiscing, on my uncle's death 
A bitch nigga left him bleeding, from the front to the back 
I still remember, when my uncle got released from jail 
All he wanted was a wife, a house and some mail 
I can't believe my uncle gone, his memory gon' live on 
Every night I'm asking God, that my uncle make it home 
Every night I'm asking why, the hell do we die 
Lord knows I miss my uncle, you could see it in my eye 
Lord please before I die, just give me a chance 
So for once I could just hold, a mill' in my hand 
So much love for my uncle, may he rest in peace 
Wesley Penn and Kevin Miller, y'all in my memory 

[Chorus - 4x]</pre>
