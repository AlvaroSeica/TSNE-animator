[Intro]
This nigga crazy {*END OF MESSAGE*}
This nigga man {*TO DELETE THIS MESSAGE PRESS 7*}
{*TO SAVE IT IN THE ARCHIVE PRESS NINE*}
{*some girl is laughing at his dad*}
My dad bro listen to him, the faggot-ass nigga

("In the hospital, shot? What the fuck goin on?")
{*END OF MESSAGE, TO DELETE...*} {*girl laughs again*}
{*MESSAGE WILL BE SAVED FOR 7 DAYS*}

[Hodgy Beats]
I never think too hard, I always drink too hard
Pair of panties, two bottles nigga I floss they floor
Nigga pick up your jaw, nigga here come the law
Drop Wolves, pop fools, leave him hit like he broke
You either witness or not, we tieing niggaz like knots
Bloody nose full of snot, Odd Future gold and you rock
Over the stove and the pot, them bullet holes and you drop
Sixty-fo' lo-lo, full of hoes gettin cock
Uh, I'm off the chain consider a loose dog
Ha, I make it rain consider a new dog
Precipitation, condensation, conversations, obligations
Takin place when in the basement of hatred where Satan's waitin
for - me to pull up the whip, swagger got an upper lip
Lesbians gotta cuff they chick around me cause I fuck they bitch
I rippin throught these speakers like I trip it to these speakers
Mascots and cheerleaders, ballers whistlin they sneakers
George was worthy to ocean, Earl was shippin them coffins
Cause we sellin that frosting, that Stone Cold, that Steve Austin
You can't get this shit for free but you can get it for a fee
You can take her on a spree, finish up and bring her to me
Finish up bring her to me, we ain't goin on a spree
I don't have to pay a fee cause bitch I do this shit for free
Difference between me and you, opposite mag-a-nets
See me I'm living straight while you taking turns faggin it
Left brother wanna take a drag from it
Inhale, exhale like a dragon bitch
Got a monkey in the cupboard like Aladdin did
Get your swag from me, then rap the shit
You shop at K Mart, I shop at AK Mart
I'm aimin at they heart nigga better duck if they smart
Where them fuckin guns at?</pre>
