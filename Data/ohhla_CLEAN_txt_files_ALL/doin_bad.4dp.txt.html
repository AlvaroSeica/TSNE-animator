(If I'm making $500 a night
why should I go to McDonald's and work
and make 3.25 an hour?)

[ VERSE 1: Koo Rod ]
I ain'sta struggle all my life and don't have shit
I'd rather gamble with death and come up quick
Have fun and if I die young, oh well
Fuck it, I had a stroke of bad luck
But shit, there's money to be made, so I gotta make it
And I'll be damned if I let another nigga take it
I done made up my mind, I can't turn back
Illegal business is my trade, I manufacture crack
Cause a nigga gotta survive in yo society
So comin up, fool, is top priority
So if it don't make dollars, then it don't make sense
Pullin up lint don't pay the fuckin rent
I'm gettin paid, so motherfuck your welfare
Got my girl stressed, pullin out her motherfuckin hair
Cause she don't know if she's gonna eat today
Have a place for her and my kid to stay
So I had to step in to provide for her
Cause that son of a bitch Uncle Sam lied to her
Hard work paid off, so now it's peace time
So baby get your ass out the fuckin cheese line
From now on, hoe, you can have it yo way
And if you want every fuckin day is yo day
Bein broke ain't no motherfuckin joke
So if I gotta do it, huh, I'ma sell my dope
( ? ) was all a nigga had
I'm doin bad, so I'm goin bad

(I ain't goin out like a sucker)
(If I gotta do it, huh, I'ma sell my dope)

[ VERSE 2: Klas 1 ]
I was born dyin, so it don't help me to play
I wish I could escape and break the yellow tape
I'm only 16, I'm headed straight to prison
Kill or be killed - even though I'm a Christian
And my mama say I won't make 20
Straight to my grave is where she needs to send me
And plus I'm disobedient
I guess I'm just like pops - not worth shit
But now I got a plan, G
To run away from the crib cause my family don't understand me
So now I'm on the move smokin Indo
Gotta keep my eyes on the front and the back do'
And at school it's the same shit
So I dropped out the bitch and jumped in the dope click
I might as well since my homies did it
Yeah, I'm afraid but I'm gettin paid, so I won't admit it
And plus I got a chance to come up quick
Stick a Puerto-Rican and that's a big lick
I got him for his Jeep and a couple of G's
Now I'm kickin up dust like an OG
But I still got a choice to make
Stay my ass in the game or try to make a clean break
Yeah, I'm headed for a quick death
But I gots to come up for my goddamn self
I guess it's straight to a grave for a nigga like Chad
I'm doin bad, so I'm goin bad

(I ain't goin out like a sucker)
(If I gotta do it, huh, I'ma sell my dope)

[ VERSE 3: Koo Rod ]
What can I do, what can I do, I really don't know
All I know's I'm fuckin tired of bein broke, hoe
I tried to live my life the way my mama taught me to
"Stay in school, get a job and go to church, Koo"
Got my diploma and that bullshit degree
Straight to unemployment's where that motherfucker sent me
Since times are hard I try to pray every day, G
Went to the preacher man to see if he could save me
But he can't help me cause he's caught up in that spotlight
Just another politician preachin for the gay rights
Where could I turn, how could I do the fuckin right thing?
That's when I went out and got off in this dope game
Now ever since that day I'm hunted as a fugitive
If that's the price I gotta pay fuck it, I gotta live
I ain'sta be broke but now bitch
Got me all fucked up with that minimum wage bullshit
A 9 to 5, I'd rather serve 25 ( ? )
I'm doin bad, so I'm goin bad</pre>
