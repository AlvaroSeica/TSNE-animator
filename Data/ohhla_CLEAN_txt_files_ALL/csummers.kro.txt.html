Krohme - it's the BK to VA

[Krohme]
The world's been patient waiting for the savior of the game
Took aim and fired shots to stop imposters speaking lame
I've laid in waiting, making ammo, fueling fire's burning
Learning from the greats, creating classic rappers listen spurning
The righteous hate the wicked; wicked hate the righteous man
But still I speak the knowledge hoping truth will light this darkened land
I came rejecting riches; pit this vicious dog 'gainst bitches?
My mission's simple end you snitches spreading lies and wishes
I've carved my niche existed, stripped the title from deceivers
Reap the failures, hate the savior, saving rap from ill dream weavers
My Kingdom's growing, message flowing from the oceans on
A dawn approaches most of you await my movements like a pawn
When will he fail? Will he fall victim to the world's temptations?
Worship diamonds; kill for money, laying back, my movement's patient
They lend their ears to hear the teacher teach the final lesson
Blessing those who've waited for the wisdom ending mortal guessing

(Chorus) Razah
Money got you selling your soul
You could tell we're in hell when the summer is cold
Cock back, shoot an emcee, empty, reload
Tell the truth to the seeds 'til the world explode, whoa!

Money got you selling your soul
You could tell we're in hell when the summer is cold
Cock back, shoot an emcee, empty, reload
Tell the truth to the seeds 'til the world explode, whoa!

[Hell Razah]
It's like I fell from heaven using my mind for a physical weapon
Armageddon is the place that we're destined, hear my depression
It's more deeper than my facial expression
You know emotions only makes me stronger, makes me longer

[Krohme]
Armed to the teeth the streets they need a priest to preach
These gifts to lift and teach, to reach these babies
Maybe more than ice and cash and whips and ladies
Lately Satan tried to test my faith and patience like I'm Job
Stood strong and held my ground against these liars, thieves, these friends and foes
Refuse to speak; they leech off strong in mind and mental spirit
Fear this man who conquers land with scriptures speaking masses hear it
Clearing stages pages printed visions entered men and women
Listen closely approach the blessed one, the son unfold beginnings
I've lived a life that's humble, simple, walked a narrow line
I find the truth revealed, unsealed to those who've struggled in their time
My mind containing jewels, the schools beneath this plane of education
Practice what you preach and teach the weak to gain their own salvation

(Chorus) Razah
Money got you selling your soul
You could tell we're in hell when the summer is cold
Cock back, shoot an emcee, empty, reload
Tell the truth to the seeds 'til the world explode, whoa!

Money got you selling your soul
You could tell we're in hell when the summer is cold
Cock back, shoot an emcee, empty, reload
Tell the truth to the seeds 'til the world explode, whoa!

Money got you selling your soul
Money got you selling your soul
Money got you selling your soul
You could tell we're in hell when the summer is cold
Cock back, shoot an emcee, empty, reload
Tell the truth to the seeds 'til the world explode, whoa!
