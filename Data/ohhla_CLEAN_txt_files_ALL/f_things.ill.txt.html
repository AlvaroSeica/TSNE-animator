Song:   Favorite Things
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Blueprint]
My favorite things include hip-hop crowds that ain't biased
Seein heads participate in real rhyme cyphers
Open mics with nobody spittin a written
Original MC's that love being different

[Illogic]
My favorite things include, open minds to open mics
and when I get open from rhymes that strike
Creativity's a plus, plus an MC that can crush without a cuss
and it's nice when a DOPE chick bust

[Blueprint]
My favorite is b-girls that pop and lock
They're able to rock the spot, passers by that stop and jock
Cats that come to a hip-hop spot
without feelin the need to cop a glock and lick shots

[Illogic]
When a true MC spits raps composed of delicate prose on tracks
and when it's felt by the masses
Platinum respect lackin blunt ashes
Battle clashes from the top to drop any approachin amateur
When a challenger's up to caliber

[Blueprint]
MC's that shine without boastin
MC's that rhyme with the motion
Elevation without the high-postin
MC's that never lose touch and do they own street promotion

[Illogic]
When an MC's spirituality is the point focal
Minds bi-coastal, expandin beyond the local
And when I'm chillin with the pen and pad, fillin the lab with vocals
of melodic tunes that, reak of the underground perfume

[Blueprint]
When somebody I don't know gives me compliments
Seeing humbleness replace overconfidence
Hearin MC's that rap about the consequence
instead of glorifyin a lifestyle that lacks any type of common sense

[Illogic]
The lack of wack rhyme writin, and rhyme bitin
The ignitin of flames that fuel innovation
Tappin into the realm of concentration
to where the listener feels he's hopped dimension
Lyrics to make aliens stop and listen

[Blueprint]
The absence of yellin on my mixtapes
Any additional loops in my milk crates
Record shops where I cop all my beat breaks
Recordin every one of my verses on the very first take

[Illogic]
When the loop speed doesn't exceed 90
And to catch a line an MC must rewind me
To know my mom's behind me
That I make this my art, my culture, my release
My outlet by means through which I reveal the beast

[Blueprint]
When my EPS doesn't overheat
Rebootin and not lose an entire beat
When somebody wanna diss or underrate me
I know this sounds strange, but it motivates me

[Illogic]
Stereo-stereotypes crushed, the shatter of grey matter
Clutch the mic 'til it rust
When an +Unforeseen+ kid bust
In wild styles to thrust thoughts like rapids to rush

[**both**]
These are a few of our favorite things in hip-hop
And there's a lot more where those came from, don't play dumb
You know they're some of yours too
And if not, jot some, serve 'em, and do your best to preserve 'em
Our favorite things in hip-hop
And there's a lot more where those came from, don't play dumb
You know they're some of yours too
And if not, jot some, serve 'em, and do your best to preserve 'em
