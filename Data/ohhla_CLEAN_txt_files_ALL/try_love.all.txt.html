Song:   Try My Love
Typed by: Cno Evil

[Allah Real]
A picture perfect memory is what I see
When you're with me
But your playing games with my heart
Oh why did you, tease me, this way? Stop crying

[Chorus: Allah Real]
Baby don't try my love
Or we could be, so happy, girl
Baby don't try my love
Because I believe, in dreams come true

[Allah Real]
Now can't you see, my heart's on the run
I need your love, right by my side
Stop, your everything I need in my life
Please here and stay, with me, tonight

[Chorus]

[Allah Real]
Oh, I love you
Please, I want you
Now come to me and share all my love
I beg you girl, to this place in my heart
So stop playing, your everything I need in my lief
Please here and stay, with me, tonight

[Chorus to fade] </pre>
