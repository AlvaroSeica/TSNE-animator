[John Henrik Clarke]
Nearly all religion was brought to people
and imposed on people, by conquerors
And used as the framework to control their minds
My main point here is that, if you are, a child of God
and God is a part of you, then in your imagination
God's supposed to look like you
And when you accept a picture of the deity assigned to you
by another people you become the spiritual prisoners
of that other people
