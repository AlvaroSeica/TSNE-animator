Get ready for the Luminati tsunami

C4 ??? ???
Eat meat raw
Street dawgs
Rip these off
And put C's on
Had to ease off
From a show I just peed on
Bought a two-seater that I put 10G's on
Beat her
Cause she took my mother fuckin ring off
She took me to Supreme Court
And the judge got screamed on
They sent me up North
To a prison with a ???
All day long
Lift weights we ??? ???
Meet King-Kong, Big Don, and Little Shawn
Murda One got big arms
He real strong
Beat his own mom 'cause she stole from the weed farm
Word on the streets
Raw
Don't beef with Armstrong
Wrong season
Lou crush anything he breathes on
Pass me the paper and pen
And put beats on
Rip rap songs

[Canibus]
Yo!
You mess with my horse
You dead as a corpse
Forget it
Rhymes without ending
With infinite lyrics
Fools you do get abused like broads
In a battle for truth with rhymes and metaphors
When my horse appears
Count your prayers
Stab you in the ear
Then pull out the spear
Watch the crowd cheer
Leave the floor wet
With all the blood stains
So the audience knows
The Canibus runs things
I rip down stages
On many occasions
Dozen of broken down mics and melted tape decks
Everywhere I go niggas wanna rob me
Bootleggers be in the front row
Trying to get a clear copy
So take caution
Cause I'm a horseman
And I'll snatch that ass up quick like "turn it off man"
So just acknowledge
The way that I'm gifted
Cause if rap was a felony
I'd be in prison
Hogging up the phone
Cussing at the C.O's
25 to life
With no parole
When battling me
You must be feeling yourself
I rip the jacker so hard
He might kill himself
Like his name was Todd or James
Back in the dark days
It's like a pit bull getting bit by a Shar-Pei
I defend my horse, my men, my friends
My baby's momma
And my offspring
So bring it on then
So I can show you how I devour
Niggas like a rottweiler with acidic saliva
Step ya shit up
Nigga
The rippa's much iller
Cause when I write rhymes
I use the mind to pick the pen up
Most artists are garbage
No skills
They belong in a landfill
Nobody feels it when the grab the mic (let me hear something else)
And start bragging about their massive ice
I can't eat MC's 'cause I lost my appetite
I'm a beast
You a midget
With wack lyrics
Like doctor evil said (quiet, shut up, zip it)
I rain superior
My metaphors are scarier
Non-ill rappers
You better evacuate
Before I exfoliate your face
With abrasive phrases
To give your face a face-lift
Germane spits insane shit
So stop hating if you cant applaud me
And give rap music the glory
