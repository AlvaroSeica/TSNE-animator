[Wafeek]
I rock a conflict diamond in my earlobe, I hear more evil
Shit, I hear more evil
I rock a conflict diamond in my earlobe, I hear more evil
I hear more evil

I rock this conflict diamond in my earlobe I hear more evil
Revealed in a voice that'll kill most people
The prequel to death, ain't no sequel to that
You hear it when I rap it, my spirit is in the rapture
Trapped in that moment in time before I'm gonna die
I fill my soul inside and keep my hopes alive
But, slowly it's risin from my chest
If I don't believe in the life after my death
Will I drift in a sea of silence as I slept
Set, fire to the tree of knowledge tryin to keep from fallin
It's like I came from Hell
to find Heaven done gone up in flames as well
I cain't call it, the thought is heavy, my brain's brolic
Now it's just stains on the carpet
Wipe that, frown off the face of the planet
Lord don't forsake me for breakin commandments
An idle, thought I was God, Allah was the title
I used when I cruised with my music disciple
Suicidal recital, for the white folk
I was brainwashed by that menstraul cycle
Shed blood in the song, they paused when I'm gone
Take a shot, of that Molotov, pay a penny fo' my thoughts
A penny saved and a penny is pretty much - worthless
Anyway who answer Christ when he pray? Huh
For a rude awakening within the grave

I rock a conflict diamond in my earlobe, I hear more evil
I hear more evil

"When the chips are down, these uh, these civilized people"
"They'll eat each other, see I'm not a monster"
"I'm just ahead of the curve..."
