'Yo I remember Marvin Gaye used to sing to me
He had me feelin like black was the thing to be'
And suddenly the ghetto didn't seem so hard
We didn't need no job, we still beat those odds
I'm a dreamer, at least that's what mama be sayin
I mix work and play, she got no time to be playin
I was tryina be patient, let life come to me
And envisioned the day that we be livin comfortably
But it never did happen, not for me or the crew
So they took to the corner, made it do what it do
Started off with the nicks, then moved to the dimes
Put so many in they pocket in like two week's time
They ( ? ) in my grill, but I was still chill
They would say that I was gettin my clothes from Good Will
Well all I do is laugh it off
As we ( ? ) to the board or played basketball
They had the new tennis shoes, but to me it was the same
Cause to me those kicks didn't improve they game
'Freakin brothers every way' - Nah, that was Ice Cube
Had no problem with drugs till it took one of my dudes
It's like braggin on havin the best casket
You gotta be dead, so do it even matter?
Come back to the block and they can't be found
So I was glad I was content with my hand me downs
You know

[ CHORUS: Random ]
Socks to shoes, pops to moms
What's mine is yours, what's yours is mine
You're my brother, so even if you can't be found
It's all good, I take those hand me downs
From shirts to hats, even a couple dollars
Whatever you need holler, I got you, it ain't a bother
Cause I know if mines can't be found
You'll be there with a hand me down

Now that's what's up

[ VERSE 2: Random ]
I just lost my job over some bull
The boss said I'm expendable cause I ain't had no pull
Dude couldn't even tell me to my face
Sent me a little letter on my desk with a gold lace
What am I to tell my wife, what she gon' tell me?
I just bought a TV with DLB
60 flat screen, been attractin
Lots of attention, but if I ain't gettin that green
We can't keep none, but it's no refunds
Thought it was sweet, hon, now look what we done
But she ain't buyin that cause it was me
I was the one in the store sayin, "Baby trust me"
Cause I thought I had job security
( ? ) my authority
But at least I can tell my man
Spill my guts and he'll tell me, "I understand"

[ CHORUS: Random ]

[ VERSE 3: Random ]
I remember Marvin Gaye used to sing to me
He had me feelin like free was the thing to be
Cause that was a brother that was breakin the mold
A true artist that had taken control
Because he had the voice and conviction that could shake the soul
And even though the industry had taken its toll
Dude refused to be less than Marvin
Even if it meant the label kept him starvin
But it just wouldn't happen cause he was too gifted
It taught me that true talent shouldn't be shifted
And maybe if rappers was more like that
With less fallin in line and more fightin back
Then maybe we could recognize our true worth
Cause all diamonds get found underneath the earth
So in that case underground ain't so bad
And true blue music just ain't no fad
When I started I wanted to be a rapper
Not really an artist cause I was just a novice
Influenced by the greats with successful careers
Used to look at 'em as my heroes and now they my peers
So even though so many can't be found
I'm greatful to accept y'all hand me downs
I said even they can't be found
I'm greatful to accept y'all hand me downs
Ya heard
