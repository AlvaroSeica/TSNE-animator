Song:   Where Is My 40?
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Intro/Chorus]
Where, is my 40? I can't find my 40 sporty {*3X*}
Where, is my 40? I can't find my 40

[mc chris]
Where is my 40? Where are the people?
Eager to leave and commit acts of evil
Stuck at my job, I hear there's a rager
So cold it's gold, and there's C4 in my pager
Here there be ladies, wearing tight clothing
Hopefully somebody there will be holding
Late to the date that's great and I'm rolling
Can't wait to escape and be done with these doldrums
Can't wait to be wasted and plastered and plifted
Can't wait to debate which country hid nukies
Can't wait to have vomit and blood on my breath
Can't wait to digest if there's anything left
I must come out my door and take out the trash
Do all my chores, impossibly fast
Be lightning to dash, break open the Colt
as I drink ounces of glorious gold

[Chorus]

[mc chris]
The dude at the deli is smelly and smarmy
Sells me a 40, I'm horny for party
and five party licks, the kind that's generic
I also bought condoms and wasn't embarrassed
Alcoholism has millions of perks
Traditional troubles with bubbles and burps
My Irish ancestry has left me with lager
I guess I'm a jigger instead of a jagger
The caterwauls costs, the Bufferin's great
I'm ready for belching and barfing escape
Let's howl at the moon and croon while we drink
Let's wake up the wind and begin like I'm late
Anticipation, my heart is beating
This side is odd, this side is even
The numbers decrease, smokers are mingling
Every inch of my body is tingling

[Chorus]

[mc chris]
They introduce you to the world they call shots
Whiskey and bourbon what starts out with schnapps
Goldschlager's exciting, there's little gold flakes
Aftershock shots and I'll puke in your face
A buttery nipple, liquid cocaine
Who's the fuck keeps loading up trays
Tomahawk, triple sec, then kamikazes
I feel no pain, nothin can stop me
Where was my stuff? It was right here
My shitty mix and my bag of beer
Now where did I place it? Where has it gone?
If somebody drank it then fuckers it's on
Not in the fridge start looking at culprits
Gangrenous guzzling down my indulgence
Imagine the bottles are bottomless backwards
Say that it's somewhere I'm gettin my hacksaw

[Chorus]</pre>
