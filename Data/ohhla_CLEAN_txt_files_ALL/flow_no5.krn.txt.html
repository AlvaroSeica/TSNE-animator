Flow session number five, five see...

[K-Rino]
Your first mistake, was coming inside my flow zone
You got it wrong, like skinny dipping with clothes on
Anytime I get the chance to spit nonstop
I'm happy as a crackhead, alone inside a pawn shop
You got a whole lot of songs, and some silly bars
They like your children, you claim em but they ain't really yours
Before you even rehab, I make you relapse
And throat slap your adam's apple, down into your kneecaps
Wrecking the game, I'm that vain in your neck lancer
Disrespect, you getting checked like a correct answer
Closed my eyes, and grew three times the size of you
I'm so surprisingly wise, even my lies are true
Wanna be down, guess how many flows you gotta spit
Like toilet paper, I'ma put you through a lot of (quit)
K-Rino, getting merked, by your kinda flow
You never see it, like a Rolex at a dollar sto'
A lot of do' in my pocket, plus the urge to spit it
Hands behind my back, writing 87 words a minute
My wordplay inside your brain, it won't work I'm sorry
That's like a Xbox game, inside the first Atari
How many battles did I lose, I'll be the first to laugh
That's like asking how many sides, does a circle have
I go fed, cause I'm trying to make some real bread
With no meds, I get it popping like a pill head
To make a move, to knock K-Rino from the top
Is dumb, like trying to use a Kleenex to block a gunshot
My tongue's a knife, so watch out for your spleen
Cause I'ma make a cut, like I tried out for the team fool
You do the same routine, ain't no best parts
I hate looking at it, like your girlfriend's stretch marks
My raw essence impecable, way past average
That's why my battles end faster, than a bad marriage
I'm a miracle child, that's what they told my mother
I'm a year and a half older, than my older brother
Such a problem in the game, they kept me left out
A scared rapper, hired me to take myself out
Somebody said, I was a artificial emcee
They got they information R-O-N-G
My neighborhood, ain't a place you wanna visit often
You 35, buying jeans from the kids department
It'll be a cold day in hell, when I fail
I stand behind these bars, like I was in a cell
No mirrors in my house, I don't wanna face myself
I'm messing the game up, like a replacement ref
At the top of the list, is where my head ranks
I'm so great, I slapped the rapper and he said thanks
You wanna work with me cool, I won't be long with ya
Commit suicide, then I'll make a song with ya
I set a trap, cause you thought you were deceiving K
He took the bait, like Skip Bayless and Stephen A.
Needless to say, I don't play the way these dudes play
My shows be packed, like Popeye's on Tuesday
No conversation no fake threats, just simply boom
I get standing ovations, inside a empty room
How you got matched up with me, I don't know how at all
That ain't fair, like Oprah winning the Power Ball
You said I'd never be the greatest, with a pen G
Can't say the word never, without having envy
Lied and said you had a deal, want a congratulations
That ain't no contract, that's a Krogers application
You say you bought it like LeBron, now it's modern
Cause you got's no rings, like a phone on silent
Or even vibrate, with twenty five folks dialing
And I wouldn't touch your girl, if we was stranded on a island
Why am I great, cause I practice and study the game
Said he wanted his mind read, so I bloodied his brain
No time for these cowards
It's not enough hours in the day, so I squeezed days into a hour
My life's scripture, I'll reveal it then go backwards with ya
Old on my before shot, a baby on my after picture
I'm too intelligent, I'll mash you into gelatin
You'll never be tight, like spandex on a skeleton
I got em scared, when I show up they gon' run and beg
Rappers split faster, than skinny jeans on your mama's leg
I'm a cappella, killing after the track
Against me you have no wind, like a asthma attack
They complain, cause my flow murders are kept on tape
Every line I made em wine, like stepped on grapes
Most artists say that they great, but they don't want no part of K
No I'm not Tim, but I'm fiending to take your heart away
Let's go to war today, I'ma have you hell bound
I'm not alone, I got back up like I fell down
Not to be arrogant, but this ain't no comparison
Record labels don't wanna sign us, like Claritin
I'm so emphatically talented, it's embarrassing
And with these punch lines, I'm the man son like Marilyn
Stop my grind boy, you out of your mind
I'm getting my weight up, like I left somebody behind
I don't start it up, but I never run from any drama
Burn your arm with a hot iron, like Penny's mama
I'ma come through when it's crunch time, with clever flows
You like a 24 hour store, you never close
The deal, you don't write cause you a biting faker
You don't have no lines, you like typing paper
If you diss me, and start telling them strong lies
You better take it back, like it's the wrong size
Rappers hate, when they hear my album's finna drop
I'm bussing everyday, like my car was in the shop
Stop lying on the mic, about your perfect sound
Everything you say is made up, like a circus clown

(*talking*)
