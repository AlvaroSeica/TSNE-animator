Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Up and over again, it's just the same thing
Up and over again, it's just the same thing
Up and over again, it's just the same thing
Up and over again, it's just the same thing
Up and over again, it's just the same thing
Up and over again, it's just the same thing

Oh oh hey, I'm having a ball
Dance dance dance to the cosmic downfall
Oh oh hey, I'm having a ball
Dance dance dance to the cosmic downfall
Oh oh hey, I'm having a ball
Dance to the cosmic downfall

It's just the same old same old same old thing
The bee will sting, elephant in the room, stops to sting
Did you think, if you're done done that's not what you get
Good people best get is not what you would take
Cause you forget, the cosmic's in your plastics begging one bi-toxic
The narcotic oh American dreams yea
We got it!

Oh oh hey, I'm having a ball
Dance dance dance to the cosmic downfall
Oh oh hey, I'm having a ball
Dance dance dance to the cosmic downfall
Oh oh hey, I'm having a ball
Dance to the cosmic downfall

It's just the same old same old same old thing
I've seen it before, I need a detour
They tried to sell me yesterday a package of this tomorrow
But how much history can you borrow?
Until you find yourself knee deep in the sorrow
What happened to the love and the truth in your morals?
Baby, this ain't a dream

Oh oh hey, I'm having a ball
Dance dance dance to the cosmic downfall
Oh oh hey, I'm having a ball
Dance dance dance to the cosmic downfall
Oh oh hey, I'm having a ball
Dance to the cosmic downfall

I got a friend, gonna go to her
To the Caribbean, the end
Like the magazine that I think I'm in
Wanna talk this one to see in his fien
I never stop, never stop, never never never stop
Ridin down sisters, I like the end

Ah there's something I've been preachin but what you think you're teachin yea?
Agreed that I'm not hungry then why duck what you are mationed up?
Often deep and into leap and what more then I still see
I know the purpose of our being, think this is achieving guy
Can I take off the weekend? No, okay I'll take the slippin
I'll be from the beginning, secrets remind you sex is still seeking

Oh oh hey, I'm having a ball
Dance dance dance to the cosmic downfall
Oh oh hey, I'm having a ball
Dance dance dance to the cosmic downfall
Oh oh hey, I'm having a ball
Dance to the cosmic downfall
