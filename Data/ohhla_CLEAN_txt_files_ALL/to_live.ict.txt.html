[Intro/Chorus: Ice-T]
Ain't nobody is safe when the streets get dark
To Live And Die In L.A.
Ain't nobody is safe when the streets get dark
The habitat of the ill motherfuckers
Ain't nobody is safe when the streets get dark
To Live And Die In L.A.
Ain't nobody is safe when the streets get dark

[Verse One: Ice-T]
It happens late night, every night my niggaz get trife
We roam the streets out for cash flow, might take your life
Throw a gun in your face quick, make you run your whole grip
If you give us drama, yo, we'll empty the full clip
Bullet holes and blood runs down the drain pipe
Gunshot, buckshot, ain't going out without a fight
But it's too late, you stayed out too late
Now, you're doing deep swallowing when you got a car following you..
(DAMN!!)
Your crew left you at the club, now you're all alone
Wishing you had've brought your chrome
Punch your ride and made it home
But that night you got lucky to live
Many niggaz in the river with the bodies like Sive
She gets shot up, if you caught up, the out tripping
Needed to take your ass home cause mad niggaz keep tripping (YAH!)
But some niggaz won't listen and play
And won't live to see the next day

[Chorus: Ice-T]
Ain't nobody is safe when the streets get dark (Westside Nigga!)
To Live And Die In L.A.
Ain't nobody is safe when the streets get dark (Yo, What's up?!)
The habitat of the ill motherfuckers
Ain't nobody is safe when the streets get dark (Yo nigga, where you from?)
To Live And Die In L.A.
Ain't nobody is safe when the streets get dark (Yeah!)

[Verse Two: Ice-T]
Slip up and get your motherfucking back blown out
By the nigga in them fresh K-Swiss no doubt
Mad jewels around my neck, oh yes, I cluck respect
I'm hitting switches in my four-door cause I crack my bet
And now I'm.. cold looking for my nigga til yet took him off
Your fake and fronting; moves you too soft
To go head up with the real OG, I'll make you pee
You shiver like a little bitch, if you're standing next to me
I love rocking through this dark ass base
As my boys robbed the party then we're out the place
Incase somebody else slipping, tripping
Creep up on their ass then I cold slab slide the clip in
And pull the Hummer back, watch them react
Then they run tell their mama, yo, they just got jacked
This ain't the kind that seemed you wanna be him
So roll with your windows up on your B.M.
Cause if I crossed your path you'll get got
L.A.P.D wanna sponsor me for Ambulance cots
Cause I'm the mad wreck catcher, my brain is on twister
Fucking shrink hit the V.P. then he snatched his wrist

[Chorus: Ice-T]
Ain't nobody is safe when the streets get dark (Eastside, Nigga!)
To Live And Die In L.A.
Ain't nobody is safe when the streets get dark
The habitat of the ill motherfuckers
Ain't nobody is safe when the streets get dark (Yo, Fuck that nigga, what's
up?)
To Live And Die In L.A.
Ain't nobody is safe when the streets get dark

[Verse Three: Ice-T]
Look deep into your animus fears, and you'll find the yellow nigga in black
Dressed like the devil to sign me
True Power, I got my pop in straps
I gangbang and then the ?? be fuck with this and thats
But now it's drama and harmer, side with my enemy
Should loose, you lost, nigga you're dead, no head
I break bones and bruise, I only miss when I misuse
A punk like your bitch-ass self can get killed
Fuck-buck around, you'll get bagged up
Cause I'ma G from South Central and I'm blue ragged up
But I got mad love for the Bloods
If you said you're my relative, I'll say you're my Cous'
No beef; I'm down to smoke white sheets
And turn the gangster into the Army that protects the streets
But sucker niggaz wanna test my heart
If you stepped deeper into my cipher and you're blown apart
No remains just bones and veins
And if you did do a escape, I use the crunches and canes
I'm nocturnal, I stalk the streets
With my niggaz on the corner, checking loot of beats

[Chorus: Ice-T with minor variations]
Ain't nobody is safe when the streets get dark
The habitat of the ill motherfuckers
Ain't nobody is safe when the streets get dark (Syndicate Nigga!)
To Live And Die In L.A.
Ain't nobody is safe when the streets get dark
The habitat of the ill motherfuckers
Ain't nobody is safe when the streets get dark (You're getting jacked
motherfucker!)

[Outro: Ice-T]
You'll Live And Die In L.A.
You'll Live And Die In L.A.
