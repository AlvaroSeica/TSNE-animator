Alright girl, alright girl
Huh, check it

[Verse 1]
Such a spark I saw embark
Kind of hard to see the cold heart
I had a hold at the start
But the mould takes its path
Don't have to ask, you seem half as smart
Used to touch her arse
How you'd pass from such a sweet girl I can't imagine
Down to earth to extremely arrogant
I'm tryna fathom why you grab him
What really happened? You don't feel my rappin
You need a slappin with a raw fish
I saw this perfect little chick
Turn from the shit to this complete stranger
Never wanted to change her, a disclaimer
What's going on? You'll never hear these songs
Cause your patience won't last that long
Feeling weak, yet I'm strong, I carry along
With a large load of weight
That you slapped on my plate
You still wanna be mates
But that doesn't make me feel that great
Your model number is different
You're off into another shipment
I'm sorry about the bitchin
But you left me twitchin in my sleep
How'd you creep from my grasp?
The dark day when your true personality slipped away
It slipped away, it slipped away
It slipped away, just slipped away

[Chorus] {X4}
You changed, you're not the same girl
You changed, now it's not the same

[Verse 2]
You were kind, considerate and down to earth
Now you're with a guy that I crown a jerk
And for it's worth, I still think that happiness is what you deserve
So it's true the word
That you're with this bloke that's pretentious
And interventious, senseless behaviour
He affected you in a major way
Now you're the player of the day
Because of the way you wear those clothes
Suppose your relation ship grows
And in a year or two, you'll have a few foes
Headaches and woes over those clothes
A little bit becoming, and that style's way out of fashion
Now what's your reaction? Get FUCKED?
That's what you would have said to the Muph
And I respect it that I can't touch on what you wanna do
But in a year or two, you two become a tight little crew
And you grew doing the things he wanted you to do
At least felt "phew" when he was impressed
With the way that you dressed
But now you're feeling built up stress
Cause you were never blessed
With the ability to be just who you are girl
I don't know who you are
Once a superstar in my atmosphere
But you wiped that clear
Along with a few salty tears, now here-here
I don't much in such of you and your new partner
But what I've heard girl, there's a lot of gaga
I'm a farm-ah just tryna grow my crops
Letting you know you've changed just like Hip Hop
But not for what I consider to be the better
I'll miss the old Olivia and that's forever
I'll miss the old Olivia and that's forever
I'll miss the old Olivia and that's forever
But I must step forth and continue with my endeavours

I'll miss the old Olivia and that's forever {*X8*}</pre>
