[Chorus/Intro: Kokane]
Awwwww, awwwwww, awwww, aww
I don't know why One Time always trippin?
I don't know why One Time always trippin?
I don't know why One Time always trippin?
I bet this time that I'm only slippin'

[Verse 1: Cold 187Um]
They tell you shut up!!
Nigga or you'll get that ass smoked
You're about 2 seconds away, from gettin' your back broke
Searchin' my car for some guns and some dope
But I don't think they find.. but some Philies and the Endo roach
Motherfuckers straight took my hide down
And since they couldn't find, shit they really wanted to clown
Sayin: who caused this? - Who bought that?
Thinkin' I don't own shit, because I'm black
They're goin' shocked when it's all in my name
And send them punk motherfuckers at the deuce trace
Cause they always actin' like the motherfuckerin' bitch
Can't see a nigga rich, can't see a nigga havin' shit
You see, that's the way they tried to play
Tried to tear up your shit and say: I'm sorry, have a nice day
Now, back in the days, I wouldn't trip, but right now
So I'ma call up my lawyer, and blow their fuckin' house down

[Chorus: Kokane w/ minor variations]
Cause I don't know why One Time always trippin?
I don't know why One Time always trippin?
I don't know why? - I don't know why? ---&gt; KM.G
I don't know why One Time always trippin?
I don't know why? - I don't know why? ---&gt; KM.G
I bet this time that I'm only slippin'

[Verse 2: KM.G]
You see, I once had a homie named Frim
He got spurn on the body cause she gave it to him
She let him spent his money here and there
She did care, baby parlay, parlay
Shake your little dirty hair
He schemed to fiend, to hang with the winnin' team
General relief, but had cavior dreams
He used to run the clique that have the gauges and the nines
The Riders and real hard times
But baby had him thinkin' in the wrong direction
Thought somehow, he needed no protection
He gave up the 4-1-1, and who was on the ground!
Who was comin' up! - and who was goin' down!
She asked the nigga if he was down with the snow
Well, you know, Above the Law is kind of down with the powder
They sent me to Texas then I went Colorado
Came back on the weekend to set up oppose
And I still got my sunday after the <name> will close
Girl, I still got my sunday after the <name> will close
Stupid ass nigga, sewed your ass the raw
Cause the bitch in the ride ain't nothin' but the Law
Attached with the wire, Colombo for hire
So now the Law was on their way
Stupid ass nigga had the burp in his tray
He probably get a dope to the ail
So don't snitch on the Clinic our way to jail

[Chorus: Cold 187Um w/ minor variations]
Cause you don't know why One Time always trippin?
You won't know why One Time always trippin?
I don't know why? - I don't know why? ---&gt; KM.G
You don't know why One Time always trippin?
I don't know why? - I don't know why? ---&gt; KM.G
You won't know why One Time always trippin?
I don't know why? - I don't know why? ---&gt; KM.G
You don't know why One Time always trippin?
I don't know why? - I don't know why? ---&gt; KM.G
You'll never know why One Time always trippin?
I don't know why? - I don't know why? ---&gt; KM.G
You don't know why One Time always trippin?
I don't know why? - I don't know why? ---&gt; KM.G
I bet this time that I'm only slippin'
I don't know why? - I don't know why? ---&gt; KM.G

[Outro: Cold 187Um]
