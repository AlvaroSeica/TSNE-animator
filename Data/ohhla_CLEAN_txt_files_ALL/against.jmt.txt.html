[Planetary]
In my historical oracle
I blast metaphorical 
editorials educating
in my territorial get torn
heavenly arm with seventy bombs 
that'll blast devine like a heavenly song 
Your men'll be gone
if they explore my people start 
i beat hearts in 2 then ask demons for chalk 
I'm dreaming a stalk 
MCees in the dark I walk 
Blindfolded the mines golded 
Watch how you talk 
My styles is an art 
Recognize lycially purity 
All hell breaks loose like a mall with no security 
The dopest vocalist 
with my third eye I focus with 
I proceed, flow with the speed of the indian motorist 
There's more of this than wasted 
Shiny chains and braclets
I hit tracks my toungue weigh 
for the brains to blaze in 
Amazin angelic, tell it to your people 

[Chorus 2X]
Illedelph is like the sun cuz we shine with rhymes 
Underground is like the moon you only see us at times 
At times with light skies when the stars recline 
Jedi Mind, outer space, coincide to combine 

[Jus Allah]
Raw poems, buried your body in catacombs 
rip your soul from your limbs 
like brims from Jip Jones 
In the Twilight Zone we disperse cowards
Vampires that stalk earth on reverse hours 
Nite cause we talk a different song 
My latitude is God darts out my jaw
leave eternal scars
You left breathing out of tubes 
Straws by the marksman, harnessin
Science for the marvelous and the charlatan
Raps will make your parallax 
My domain has power to block synapses I daze 
War shots fight of by the army type warlock 
Devil's Plan is to have you drip in the Clorox
Beast deceiving us ways devious possessing
My peeps who walk streets with stolen heat like Prometheus
Elements rushin you back to hell again
Illadelphians crush your skeleton into fuckin gelatin

[Chorus]

[Ikon the Verbal Hologram]
Dont ever come to me with war 
I'm seven scores of orators
rap is formed longer on fours like minotaurs
with Jedi Mind and the planetary we bombin this
we stand one step above you like a pharmacists 
with all in this detonate the bomb
Heads dread hallucinogenics in Vietnam
I spit a song create bombs like an Iraqi 
Swear on the bible and the lines of Ecclesiastes 

[Planetary]
Assault and battery 

[Ikon the Verbal Halogen]
Battle me that on even split you 
Store enormous amounts of energy in a crystal 
we boa constrict you
The gods of militant 
You faggots couldn't go the length 
like you was impotent, you ignorant 
Your whole click is split in half
You step in allah's path, and face Allah's wrath, WHAT

[Chorus] - 2X</pre>
