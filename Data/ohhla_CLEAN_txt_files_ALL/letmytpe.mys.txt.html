[Verse One: Mysonne] (*"Sample courtesy of "Juicy" by The Notorious B.I.G)
Let my tape rock nigga 'til the tape pop nigga
This is hip hop nigga, it ain't pop nigga
It's Mysonne, it ain't Pac nigga
I'm tryin to get that love like Pac got nigga
But don't stop it just let that play
I rep for dudes tryin to get that pay, on the block all day
With that yay or with that dollar
With respect tryin to get that power
Tryin to get that dollar (CHING CHING)
Grindin for hours just to get that (BLING BLING)
Watchin for the cowards if they got that (THING THING)
Bullets bouncin off the giant coats like (PING PING, PING PING)
We ain't all ballin, some of us is grindin
We ain't all rich, some of 'em is lyin
I represent for dudes who live in that 'jects
Tell Mister Cee, Kay Slay and Flex!!!! (*Let my tape rock)

[Verse Two: Mysonne]
Let my tape rock, I say shit
I'm tired of the radio just playin this fake shit
Feel like I'm Neo, this is +The Matrix+
Niggas is waste and washed up, chicks is basic
I'm faced with a dilemma now (What?) I can tell 'em how (How?)
they favorite rapper's a clown or I can let 'em drown (Word)
I represent the streets, I can't let 'em down
Five-star general - YES! Forget a crown
I sit around with bosses
That's married to the streets, never gettin divorces
You say you want fame, well that fame, the cost is
pain and losses, it ain't all chains and Porsches (Nope!)
I'm a artist who paintin portraits
The life I live it could make you nauseous (f'real)
Streets endorse, I speak what's true
All you DJs' know what to do (*Let my tape rock)

[Chorus: "Sample courtesy of "Juicy" by The Notorious B.I.G]

Let-Let-Let my tape rock Let my Let my tape rock
Let-Let-Let my tape rock Let my Let my tape rock
Let-Let-Let my tape rock Let my Let my tape rock
Let-Let-Let my tape rock Let my Let my tape rock
Let-Let-Let my tape rock Let my Let my tape rock 
Let my tape rock Let my Let my tape rock
