I don't read the XXL
Tote a .45, the church think I'm destined for hell, oh well
Blood tears off the face of my Jesus piece
It's bloodshed, feel the cracks in my city streets
I'm from the crack of them city streets
Used to sell crack in them city streets - born in Blood nigga
In a coma five days, life of a thug nigga
Momma ain't show, grandma almost pulled the plug nigga
Used to pull the gun out, just because of cuz niggaz
Five shots to the head cause I'm a Blood nigga
Nuttin brewin but Soo-Woo'in where the fuck I'm from
You lucky if you make it out of Compton, ask Andre Young
Smell the scent of dead bodies ridin down Green Leaf
No peace so don't get caught up with no piece
Fuck Fatburger, we cookin that real beef
Momma's mournin they sons, I'm talkin real grief
Real funerals of them lost juveniles
Tryin to be generals, be missin your dinner now, huh?
Say it's a blessin when you die in ya sleep
Cause the coroner don't need no sheets, capishe?
I'm sayin, stop playin, wrap him up in what he lay in
Fold a nigga arms, now a casket what he pray in
Compton streets raised me
Can't tell my grandma nothin 'bout her baby, you crazy

[Chorus: Tank]
Said she see no evil
She know there's nothin at all
You wanna see tomorrow
You promise not to talk
Say we on our way now
I'ma see you again
And when they ask you questions
You just answer, what happened then?
What happened then?

[Kendrick Lamar]
I live this life at a pace that anyone can go
Know your place and dedicate your role to the faith that you'll die alone
Trace your steps when I do step in the fire of broken bones
And I require my heart's desire and when I reap what I sew
I bought my momma a Benz, my boobie a Jag
A cut for my dogs, with a roof full of glass
But still I be feelin like none of my light never casts
Out of that black cloud that's been watered down since my first chopper blast
But fuck that, I'm not worried mm, even when discouraged mm
Skirt off makin them hurt off, should've hurt them in a hurry mm
Dirt off all of my fingers, dirt him, all of 'em gone is buried mm
Shirt off when precedure, resuscitation came early
I need you to keep quiet as a mouse
Which is ironic cause rats is what I'm talkin 'bout
I'm hearin the sonics of gunfire, the whispers, the silent cries
Even though we know it's eye for an eye

[Chorus]

[Tank]
I was born a soldier
Ride or die for mine
Tied two tears and a lawyer
Tried to give me love
Heaven can you heal me?
I know that Hell can
So Heaven can you heal me?
I'm only just a man, ohhhhh

[Game]
You wanna go to Compton? Nigga I'll take you there!
Hub City bodies get burnt butt-naked here
Respect the code, a nigga's callin from the pen
Colombian neck-ties on the outside from within
And then, your momma never see you again
Casket to never wake up, plastered in MAC make-up, huh?
Niggaz can't hear you talkin from the sky
And only 5 year olds see your ghost when you die, no lie
Karma catches up to all you head honchos
Two dome shots in that head, Griselda Blanco
Shit get real though inside the Fox Hills though
Nigga livin that fast life and get killed slow
Ask Wack and Draws if a nigga run the streets
My grandmother's prayers saved you niggaz, I never wanted peace
Los Angeles, I'm the motherfuckin king here
No First 48 cause muh'fuckers don't sing here
Huh?

[Chorus]</pre>
