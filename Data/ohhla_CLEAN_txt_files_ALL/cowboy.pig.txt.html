[Intro] [Pigeon John Talking]
Yeah, this is...Ferrari love. C'mon, Ferrari love
Hi ho Silver. Oh yeah, Ferrari love. Everybody. Hi ho Silver. C'mon

[Chorus]
Giddy up [x30]

[Verse One]
Y'all niggy's be trippin'
At the same time
Pigeon's still rippin'
Yo, you're lookin' like a chicken
Head cut off and you're bouncin' and slippin'
But me I'm like, "What?"
Five dollars in the pocket, still good luck
With that I take out my girl
Show her how not to eat...and the world
Let's take a trip out to Watts
Throw up in HP and get shot
Hangin' out the window and a cop
Pulls up and rudely asks what drugs we got
I said, "Hey, I don't smoke weed
I don't drink Vodka and I don't need speed."
It feels good to be me
O to the G from Hawthorne city
Oh shoot

[Chorus]
Giddy up [x30]
I don't know where to go
I don't know 
[x4]

[Verse Two]
Oh shoot I'm cute
I've got to believe that cause no one is really goin' to
I hang out with my friends
(Makin' big lucci and would have it no other way)
Yo
Who the heck was that?
I'm Pigeon John baby and this is my rap
Yo, you need some permission
(Giddy up giddy up giddy up)
Hold up on the chorus
Just listen
See
Everything around is so O to the G (ha ha)
It feels good to be free (la la la la)
Chillin' with my girl and sippin' coffee
This is for the hardcore
And you know that it's real
And you know I'm packin' steel
You need to read a book
Listen to Phil Collins and learn to write a hook

[Chorus]
Giddy up [x30]
I don't know where to go
I don't know 
[x4]

[Verse Three]
(Oh now?)
One time
Niggy's don't even know how to begin and shine
That don't even know their whole style's genuine
Created by the only true God Divine
See
He created you
Your whole little style and your weird nose too
Yo, let's get a tattoo
Tribal
Get a clue
Stop smokin' glue
I mean sniffin'
Yo, hold up wait, I'm trippin'
This is for my peeps
The skateboarders
And the dudes who drive in Jeeps
You're all a bunch of geeks
I'm just playin' dude (whoa!)
Switch up your attitude
Or get smacked in the cheek
Come on hold my hand and just rock to the beat

[Chorus]
Giddy up [x30]
I don't know where to go
I don't know
