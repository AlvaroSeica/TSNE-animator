Song:   Slow it Down
Typed by: Young Tob

(hook) 
When they speed up, I slow down 
Turn the beat up, till the speakers get so loud 
let go, don't go too fast tonight 
before your life just passes by 
we've gotta gotta take the time 
to slow it down, slow it down 

(bridge) 
hey hey hey hey hey hey that's life 
no way to escape it alive 
we all in a hurry going nowhere 
gotta slow it down, down, down 
hey hey hey hey hey they that's life 
no way to escape it alive 
we all in a hurry going nowhere 
gotta slow it down, down, down 

switching gears, fix the mirror 
caught an image of the city that was crystal clear 
tried to paint the picture as it drifted near 
saw it flicker for an instant then it disappeared 
gotta slow down to listen, hear 
the sound my vision mixed up and interfered 
every street's got a secret hid for years 
till the wind lifts the whispers and it hits my ears 
and the sound of the broken city 
speaks riddles composed of both hope and envy 
the echoes bounce back and forth and then meet 
like minor symphonies of secret hearts 
that are all played a beat apart 
and they're picking up speed trying to lead the charge 
racing through the dark trying to conquer time 
like we're all shooting stars in a concrete sky 

(hook) 
When they speed up, I slow down 
Turn the beat up, till the speakers get so loud 
let go, don't go too fast tonight 
before your life just passes by 
we've gotta gotta take the time 
to slow it down, slow it down 

(bridge) 
hey hey hey hey hey hey that's life 
no way to escape it alive 
we all in a hurry going nowhere 
gotta slow it down, down, down 
hey hey hey hey hey they that's life 
no way to escape it alive 
we all in a hurry going nowhere 
gotta slow it down, down, down 

we walk by each other so close that we start 
mimicking motions and hearts without even noticing 
like the road is just ours and we're honing in 
on the moment alone like we're oceans apart 
islands of steel drifting in unison 
wishing for human contact but get so immune to it 
as soon as we miss it, we resist it 
cause the distance makes us different till we can't attune to it 
and the cars ride bumper to bumper 
kept apart by a margin of nothing at all 
so I dart eyes up at a dark sky 
because the stars shine upward 
a far cry from the hard times suffered 
by those who start line stuck them behind 
roll up the window as a I come to a light 
retreat to the comfort inside...and slow down 

(hook) 
When they speed up, I slow down 
Turn the beat up, till the speakers get so loud 
let go, don't go too fast tonight 
before your life just passes by 
we've gotta gotta take the time 
to slow it down, slow it down 

hey hey hey hey hey hey that's life</pre>
