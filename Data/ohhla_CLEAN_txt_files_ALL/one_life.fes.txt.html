[Chorus: Fes Taylor]
I'm just living to die, dying to live
I need a better way, provide for my kid
So I hustle hard, I still put my trust in your Gods
Stay on the right path, trust me, it's hard
Jesus Christ, is here in my life
I can conquer any goal, I ain't scared of the fights
But the Devil keep holding me back, it's like you want me to fuck up
And go crazy, hoping I snap

[Fes Taylor]
I just wrote this in seed, came from standing on the corners with weed
Sold cracks to the fiends, gun in back of my jeans
Police wanna capture my team, bullets fly after the beam
In the VC, back when I lean
I get money like Starbucks coffee, asking for cream
When I reach for the big forty, I blast at you, scream
Listen, you bastards have seen, pass the degrees
Over 350 Fahrenheit, we laugh at the d's
Snitch, my actions'll be, attacking your seed
You can't ratchet with me, fuck asking me please
If I do one day in jail, off with your neck
And I'm snatching bail money, right off of your neck
I wipe fingerprints right off of the neck
Fight cops during arrest, better talk with respect
Get my lines like a book, son, I alter your best
And my life in the hood, son, I walk through with death
Aiyo, we all gon' make it to the top
I made a promise to my hood, Shaolin, I'mma make it pop
So, here we go, now, I'm totin' the four-pound
Shots spin niggas around, like Merry Go-Rounds
Cinder blocks been in ya town, locking the shit down
You popping the shit now, I'm poppin' the piss style
What's populars, get wild, I hope in the Benz, wild
You jockin' the kids style, like the pocket of Big's sound
Grab mics, squeeze the beat til it's lifeless
After me, nobody dare write to this, Rowdy Roddy Piper this
Submission move, put pressure on so many different crews
I can make it difficult, to function in the physical
Shoot through your car windows, dumping in your living room
Your partners in crime, we dump 'em in the river, to</pre>
