[ Curren$y ]
Wack niggas sleep-rappin and woke up in trouble
Wack niggas with that sleep-rappin and woke up in trouble
You was cool ten years ago, you fuckin Lex Bubble
Yeah

[ VERSE 1: Curren$y ]
Brand new tires, rollin down the same ol' strip
New party, same ol' chicks
I'm so sorry if I don't look happy to be here
And your label offers but they said I can't smoke weed here
Man fuck it, I'm out
Black-owned and I'm 'bout it, fool, I got a studio in my house
Along with some of the perks that come with my work
Pretty 20-somethin sleepin in my diamond-supplied shirt
There is not a adjective to describe how I work
Hard is not enough, brother, I'm tougher
Wack niggas with that sleep-rappin and woke up in trouble
You was cool ten years ago, you fuckin' Lex Bubbles
You gotta know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em
Learn how to roll with the punches
Take 'em to school, give these niggas brown bag lunches
If it ain't the Jets, then it ain't nothin

[ Mos Def ]
Yo 
The king closed his cloak
The set was overfull
Such a excellent moment, so emotional
They rushed out on the field, so devoted for
Final victory clutched, they went postal cold
Glory overload, hold up, hold my coat
Please, remember this day
This changes everything, we can do anything
Shorty sure anyway

[ VERSE 2: Jay Electronica ]
My mama told me, "Son, always call a spade a spade
Be like Chuck D, never be like Flavor Flav"
But that clock around his neck is so fly
And the way he complimentin Chuckie with that bow-tie flow
Make me feel high, so
I'm gon' spit it my way
Excuse me as I do me, cruisin rudely down the highway
I'm young, black, intelligent, elegant, blahse
Back to the thesis
Back to shootin craps and talkin smack to the polices
Back to black and gold Bally's, Dickeys with the creases
Pullin young'ins by the coattail, schoolin 'em who the beast is
I pray this flow is dumb enough
I pray my heart is DMC and Reverend Run enough
Cause I'ma trhow my number up
I'ma throw some chicken bones and feathers on a hundred bucks
And summon up the thunder - What?
The voodoo man is comin, brah
You can't see the forrest for the trees?
It's okay, I got my jigsaw and my lumber truck
Tell them boys they run is up

[ Mos Def ]
Yo 
The king rose and spoke
The set was overfull
Such a beautiful moment, so emotional
They cried out in the field, so devoted for
Home team champion, they went postal cold
Power overload, hold up, hold my coat
Please, remember this day
This changes everything, until you show anyway
We ready for anything</pre>
