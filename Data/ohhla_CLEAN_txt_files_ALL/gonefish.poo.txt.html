[Chorus]
Listen girl I wanna take you home
Listen girl I wanna take you home, what's your phone number?
Yo, I wanna take you home
Matter of fact, I wanna bring you home, what's your phone number?
Eh, I wanna bring you home
Listen girl I wanna bring you home, I need your phone number
Yo, can I bring you home?
I, I wanna bring you home, what's your phone number?

[Rapper Big Pooh]
It's written all over your faaace... 
..and you don't have to say a wooooord
But of course you can
I know we just e-met, I'm tryna be your man
I'm sayin, cause girl I dig your look
And against better judgment, fuck the rest of the book
What a cover, I wanna *be yo' lover, baaabe*
You say you like Prince, right?
Long walks under moonlight
You want a man to fuck you all night - RIIIGHT??
Strawberries, wine, and whipped cream
Blackberry, come and be a part of my team
Matter fact, check it out, what's ya phone number?
What's ya Skype name? You ain't got a camera?
It's all good, lemme hear what you talkin 'bout
Girl 6-type voice, I'ma rub one out
So I checked on a plane ticket
The way my account set up - well, you don't wanna hear it!
Yo, it's either train or bus
Somebody gotta travel, if it's gonna be an us
Oh.. you're busy next month?
Oh.. the next THREE months?? ..Fuck~!

[Chorus]
Yo I'm tryin to get you home
Baby girl I'm tryin to get you home, tryin to get you..
Yo, I'm tryin to get you home
And I'm tired of talking over the phone, I'm tryin to get you home
Yo, I'm tryin to get you home
Nigga tired of talking over the phone, I need to get you home

{Rapper Big Pooh singing}
If you think you're lonely noooooow..
(Oooh-yeah!) Then wait until tonight, girl

Yanahmsayin? Just talkin that bullshit, nahmean?
Like, just talkin that bullshit, yanahmsayin (HELLO?)

[Rapper Big Pooh]
I'm tired of playin this game
What the fuck you waitin on?! We need to finally set a date
Only so much time I can patiently wait
If I ain't what you lookin for then right now then I ain't
Cause I ain't... gon' keep draggin this along
And I can't... play another sad song
And I won't... keep chasin you online
And I won't... so what we finna do, huh?

[Outro]
What we finna do, yo? Like what we gon' do?
