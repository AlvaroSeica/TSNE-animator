{*"Today's agenda" - Notorious B.I.G.*}

[Royce Da 5'9"]
Ridin with them sodomy sisters
Pistol on hip, hip to your pistol
The day I bow down to a bitch'll
be the day I throw a bottle at Rihanna inside of a strip club
(Fresh off that weight scale, fresh off that, fresh off that, fresh off that)

{"Today's agenda"} Ridin with them sodomy sisters
Pistol on hip, hip to your pistol
The day I bow down to a bitch'll
be the day I throw a bottle at Rihanna inside of a strip club
Leave the booth just to leave a tooth floatin around inside of your pimp cup
What goes around comes around in the form of karma
Nah, that's probably just me ridin around your town in a Fisker
Pennin a rhyme equivalent to a winnin lottery ticket
Uh, fresh of that weight scale
Livin a crooked heaven on Earth, givin them straight hell
Kick in the door of them awards, wonderin where are we sittin
Niggaz with tight jeans lookin like where are they fittin
Beware of they writtens, it's parallel to an Arab sittin 
in the terrorist cockpit headed for hell's kitchen
I talk greasier than Harold's Chicken
Don't cross me I leave scales tippin
I'm comin (fresh off that weight scale, fresh off that weight scale)
(Fresh off that, fresh off that, fresh off that weight sc...)
My bitch curvy as a Persian virgin's features
She here to serve me, she here to disturb the reaper
I keep bank, speak Franklin's, word to Aretha
I'm fly as a bird and high as the Burj Khalifa
I ride with kings, y'all ride with fiends
You fraudulent niggaz remind me of a Ponzi scheme
One of y'all niggaz probably was cool in school
The rest of y'all niggaz was clowns, we should call you the Fonzi team
I'm hate-prone
Niggaz listen like "Ain't this about a bitch?" like it's a Drake song cause my cake long
So stay strong cause your bitch, givin me cheekbone
like Grace Jones usin my dick like a payphone
But she ain't gettin the call back, she gettin the ball sack
Hittin the jaw just where we parked at
Quick as a car jack, I ain't tryna be funny
I'm tryna be missionary lyin on top of my money
I'm comin - fresh off that weight scale (scale)

[Crooked I]
{"Today's agenda"} What the fuck would I stop for?
Knowin I need more guap stored in my sock drawer
They want an encore when the flow is at mach four
King of the jungle, no lyin/lion, I let the Glock roar
And this bullet-proof vest is irrelevant
I'm tellin them look at your melon, I'm nailin a shell in it
And the shell is movin right through your melanin to your skeleton
Then the felon is bellin the same pitch the fella was yellin and
Police sirens respond to heat firin
I'ma keep firin, I'ma flee, I'ma be quiet
I'm a G, I'm a beat tyrant
From Long Beach and I'm Eastside
I oughta, bury you artists like an artifact
Serious as a heart attack, Dodger hat, Slaughter tats
Roger that, Art of Rap, that's me
Can't believe Ice never thought of that, who the fuck brought it back?
(Fresh off that weight scale, fresh off that weight scale)
(Fresh off that, fresh off that, fresh off that weight sc...)
Fresh off that weight scale
I guess I'm Canibus and Kool Moe Dee, cause it's hard for me, to take L's
I'm tryna make more cake than a bake sale
Tell the jakes I'ma make bail then escape cause I hate jail
All these rappers sayin they spittin hard raps
Before I buy that shit, show me the Barfax
I got a tongue like a sharp ax
I got a ton of rhymes flyer than anything launchin off tarmacs
This is how real it is
When I ghostwrite for niggaz I'm speakin through them, I'm really just a ventriloquist
A iller lyricst, a hint of ignorance
A pinch of militant, a perfect description of what this nigga is
Pull out a scale and weigh CD's
Then distribute it to the fans, 'til they need me
I'm a drug dealer so put out an APB
The same shit that gave these '80s babies A.D.D.!
Comin (fresh off that weight scale)

[Joell Oritz]
{"Today's agenda"} Pyrex sit in the kitchen feelin your eye sweat
Grippin your wrist and watchin that pie stretch
Pitchin to different niggaz for figures, never slippin
5-0 trippin, I dip on them through the projects
Dope boy mindset, gotta get this money
Apply the same grind to this rhyme shit, dummy
Pick a pad, pick a pen, pick a track, pick a flow
I pick it apart like a locksmith diggin in his nose
Sit in the park with the Dre's on, waist on, heavy to eight long
Put brains on pre-K, the shell is a crayon
Man I'm just tryna write, please leave me alone
Cause I ain't tryna fight, I'm a different Iron Mike
Bite your ear with a syllable, lay a hook that'll finish you
Throwin jabs at you little dudes, my opponents get rid of you
Hit my corner and listen to Eminem, Crook and Nickel
While Joey fuckin the ring girl, man this fight is unfixable
Uhh, you rockin with a BQE boy
That BB, QZQ's and BB Kings with D-boys
Today's agenda, flame contenders
And have they dame givin brain to they favorite member
Yaowa (fresh off that weight scale)

[Joe Budden]
{"Today's agenda"} Diary of a madman
Machete choke Joe in half and here I am
Ain't gotta lie, what you see is what you get, ain't nothin modified
Me, I give 'em the same song, go check with Spotify
Don't get the context wrong, I'm the same G
Spendin old money, y'all swear it was the same G
Yeah these model hoes cute and entertain me
And though I let 'em go to the head, they never change me
Far from innocent
Your favorite rapper got a head-nod before he approached to check my temperament
I wake Sleepy Hollow, should've done a CAT scan
Go to Colorado right now and watch "Batman"
So my dad think I'm stylin, how when
I'm everything he'd be if these new drugs was out then
Owe it to holmes, rollin stone
But how I wouldn't let a stone roll, wonder why I'm stone cold?
Problem child to aggravated adult
Got bad cards but I ain't blamin my hand, it's logic
I hate jewelry and authority the same
So how the fuck you think I feel about a chain of command? I'm sayin
I tell you how you different from I
Y'all was huggin the block, I kiss it goodbye
Sober, my last drinkin game 
started with Truth or Dare and ended with me thinkin a name
So y'all call it out of control, I'm confused when
To think that you in somethin to me is the illusion
There's your answer, verbal slash cancer
Now the strip club is a basement, I just came in with some dancers
House Gang, the clan made it
Used to be scared of {?}, thought the Klan made it
... Joey the fan favorite
Love then hate it both cause I can't fake it
And if I did I would never tell
I said that all wrong, y'all would never tell
I keep the mindfuck tucked for the jezebels
Even if they help make it, shit would never fail
BIATCH!!</pre>
