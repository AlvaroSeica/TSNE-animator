I was fighting the mold in the bowl with my pee
when a thought popped into my brain (what was it?)
If all of us hated high school so much
why was nothing ever changed? (F'real)
So I called Brian up, with my plan that's red hot
It was a private institution in the name of punk rock
We got some government funding and our own private road
And a 666 for our radio snow code

[Chorus One]
I had a dream when I was in high school
That I attended, the punk rock academy
I had a dream when I was in high school
That I attended the punk, rock, acade-my!! (F'real)

[mc chris]
Chris Jensen's teaching science and he's still running mountain
We fired the guy from bad religion cause he sold punk rock out
and we'll give the dirty punks a dip &amp; get rid of all their fleas
And we'll never ever buy anything with a UPC

[Chorus Two]
I had a dream when I was in high school
That I attended, the punk rock academy
I had a dream when I was in high school
That I attended the punk I attended the punk rock academy and
no one made fun of me!

[Interlude]
Yeah~!! This is the solo, uh-oh uh-oh
Shake what'cha momma gave ya (what? what?)
Shake what'cha momma gave ya (I will not!)
The punk rock academy
Where all the students, they're diagnosed with ADD
Take me home tonight
I don't wanna let you go 'til the feeling's right
Take me home tonight
I don't wanna let you gooooo

[mc chris]
We'll import a token jock and then we'll kick his token ass
And there will never ever be a physical education class
Think about it you'll agree, it's the bizzity bizzity bomb
And maybe we can get Esock to play the senior prom!

[Chorus Two]</pre>
