Be aware
Understand clear
I aint talking bout a bear trap when I say I'm caught up in the snare
With care
I'm properly positioning the track
As if its an overview and the mission is the rap
I give
Such an accurate depiction
When I black
You can literally
Peel back
The friction off the dat
The music takes a life of its own
See the words are the people
For each one the mic is the home
The studio's the universe
The computer is the earth
Your producer is the god who designs all the work
See now everytime you bite you tongue you cause damage
Cause rappin is the action
That repopulates the planet
On some other shit
Its possible to reach a soul
Just by having people present
When you go unleash a scroll
Use your verbal firestarter partner
Heat the cold
Heres the worlds first tool where the young teach the old
The drums symbolize
The strength
That's unbreakable
Like stevie wonders ribbon in the sky
If you attempt to catch the truth
Which lives between the lies
You'll level up from 9 and leave the prison of the mind
The bass is the heart
The heartbeats the bassline
So I'm glad my producer takes time when he makes mine
The sample represents the blood pumped
The total package presented is what can make the thugs jump
I bare all to help you see you
And lead by example
You see how we do</pre>
