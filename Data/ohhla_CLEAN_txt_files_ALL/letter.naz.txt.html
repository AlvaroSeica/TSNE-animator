[Sample with (Bronze Talk)]
Even though we're apart
(yeah. whutup baby!)
Your right here in my heart
(Right here in my heart my nigga)
When it comes to losing you, I've lost a many a friend
That's why, we've got to win
Meanwhile (My dogg!), keep on writing
I'll keep writing theses letters
(RIP to Kirk Jackson, Westside Detroit Soldier
Yeah a REAL soldier,
I can do nothin but write you my nigga)
Keep on writing, I'll keep writing these letters

[Hook]
Oh ooooohhhh Baby!
I saw your life flash like the sky
I knew that it was time to say goodbye
I saw your life shine like the moon
I never thought we'd lose you so soon, AYE AYE!!!

[Bronze Nazareth]
We haven't spoke in awhile so please bear with me
You on my mind my nigga I'm hopin you'll forgive me
I shoulda saw the signs, it still lives with me
6-9-09 I climb a vine, put one in the air to lift him
Now listen!
Physicians 'scribe the new heroin
Soma comas overthrowing new age Pharoah Kings
I was the WORST friend
Couldn't see poison through veins
Losing you in vain
from making tracks I shoulda stopped the train
(DAMN!) We shared sunny days
Now memories outage your physical
Remember even if outlived, we saved kids in the ghetto!!
Life is too slow for some to wait, too fast for those who left
I once heard when a man's work is done  it's natural to rest!
It crippled my nigga
Sippin the liquor wondering where you had been
I'm stuck in the kitchen cooking elixers
Your soul mixing with wind!!
Desert storm couldn't get you but Detroit did you in!
From the sand to the concrete a soldier wore thin! Huh
I'm at your funeral, tears thrust from my wig
And when they carried you out, I told you my nigga JUST LIVE!!!
And we can build about the stars and the sun
Cause like Donny sung I guess tomorrow's only made for some!

[Bronze Talk]:
(I'm mad at you right now man!)
and I don't understand why,
the good die mostly over bullshit! (I don't understand)
and it remains this way (miss you my nigga!) to this day

[Bronze Nazareth]
Kirk, if you let me continue, I'll make it worthy!
Allah saw you needed to rest a little early
You never said goodbye, it still stings surely
I fight my mind to write these lines hoping to God you heard me!
My own admission, never imagined you were hurtin'
didn't listen to your pleas
I shut the curtain, knockin you back down on your knees
a change gon' come
but I was certain it wasn't this one
DAMN! I'm selfish 
shoulda developed the film different
I shoulda saw the light beams, it spilled brilliant
6-9-09 I take my time, spill my wine and kill it
May God forgive him
Powders of prison, meant to stop the pain
Instead, they tear a house apart ending the reign of a king
Still I feel I failed my friend in his illest days
You in withdrawals at the Lex, I thought you a flu strain
Damn I'm blind! I Blame myself how could I not see!?
And here I go again  makin it all about me! huh!
Thought I had more time to reach you, to talk and intervene
But Allah spoke, so follow me now, I'm walking for three
It shattered your dreams
Puffin G's while my wounded pen bleeds
You stuck in addiction
Fuckin affliction brought you down to your knees
The persian gulf couldn't drown you like these cement seas
The will of steel bent and crushed by a pill, who could believe?
Big Kirk (Fuzzy!) one of the illest mouthpieces
I swear that you could talk the meaning of life straight outta Jesus!
At your funeral I sunk in the pew, searching for reasons
For every long harsh winter it's a change of the seasons
So keep breating! I missed you even before they put you under
Like Stevie Wonder, I never dreamed you'd leave in summer!
My nigga..Rest baby!

[Hook]

(Refrain X2)
Deceased plans lotto tickets and beer cans
Smoke signals, pills, spoons, and powder grams
He was guided by the streets, and it taught him how to die
And I never swam the ocean 'cept the ones that I could cry
Hope you find the peace in death, that eluded you in life
Detroit Zoo to Gun Rule, Stars reflect the moonlight (huh)(Kirk!)</pre>
