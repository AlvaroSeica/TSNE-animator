[Intro: Yukon Black]
I guess this means I'm back
It's good though, Knowhatimsayin

[Yukon Black]
I've been told a lot of things in my little bitty life
I've been sold a lot of dreams by some shitty niggas shisty
Cause the inner city hype could be the hustler fight
Pick up a ball or a mic, Don't even think about being a lawyer
You aint the type, You aint white, You aint right
So I'm sellin somethin different tellin niggas you can get it
Sisters you aint got to stick to strippin and trickin
You aint raw. (Get it, Get it)

[Chorus 1: Yukon Black]
It's time, (Get it) Get on your grind, (Get it)
It's yours, (Get it) We aint poor, (Get it)
Get on your grind, (Get it) It's time, (Get it)
You aint poor, (Get it) It's yours. (Get it)

[Yukon Black]
Momma told me fake it to make it
I grew up became a Begga told myself you better take it
This world aint gonna give it nigga you better go get it
For as long as I've been livin I've been seein people wishin
That's why we still sittin on the bottom
Let me tell you, This nigga here's a problem
Stop talkin, No walkin, Start stompin if you want it
Get some gamma in your manners and go out and get it. (Got it)

[Chorus 2: Yukon Black]
It's yours, (Get it) You aint poor, (Get it)
It's time, (Get it) Get on your grind, (Get it)
It's yours, (Get it) We aint poor, (Get it)
Get on your grind, (Get it) It's time, (Get it)
You aint poor, (Get it) It's yours. (Get it)

[Sample]
We have shifted from having a seizure about what the man got
To seizing what we need
We have shifted from bed bugs and dog ticks
To community control and politics
Now stand together, Raise your fists, Together
And engage...

What time is it? Nation time!
When we stand together, what time is it? Nation time!
When we say no more yesterballs what time is it? Nation time!
What time is it? Nation time! What time is it? Nation time!</pre>
