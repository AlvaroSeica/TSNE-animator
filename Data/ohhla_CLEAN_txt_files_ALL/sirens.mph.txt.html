"Cause you can never go home anymore, listen"

[Verse 1]
She whistles when she speaks
Got the high pitch shrieks
Sends sex signals to the rhythm of the beat
In an instant the symphony of a bittersweet
Intricately placed vocal tone that overthrows resistance
Intimately seduced by the red juice of Bruce upon her thick lips
Drawn towards the pool of this enriched list
To think quick - it's just not an option
Fingertips reach out for the satin sheet soft skin
Locked in, mesmerized by her leather thighs
And her gentle eyes, topspin pebbles peddle across the lost sea
She sits perched amongst the rocks, part of her prophecy
And I'm a comedy act, entrapped within her odyssey
Her oddities begin to bear through
I'm like the scared youth prepared to mute the commuters
Confused, consuming the coopers
A part of a music's movement
Pays attention to grooming, tuning the pitchfork
Vibrating through your pride to lift doors
And flip your focus, drink your dosage
They keep asking how the heartstrings survive
After constant strumming and dumbing down our lives
Wondering about the fun it brings when we fly

"Cause you can never go home anymore"
As the notes in her vocals drift she's got me
"Never can go home anymore"
As the notes in her vocals drift she's got me

"Cause you can"

[Verse 2]
She smells like the fuel in my car and her
Touch is kind of cold and sharp, she
Feels like the top of the moon
Tastes like poison, distorts the view
She'll serenade all of you and walk through
The fort around your portaloo, there's more to
What meets the eye of this messed up corkscrew
Twisting along the tracks that stand before you
It's the peer pressure I spread on thick
And it ain't clear weather when the fingers click
Can't help but pay attention to the infectious itch
She's a sexy bitch, wondering will she let me live
Many get caught in the mix
Looking forward to a fix, an assortment of tricks
Which - slip underneath the sleeve
She's got something we never had but now we need

"Cause you can never go home anymore"

[Bridge - Repeat X5] (4th and 5th time become softer)
She's guns, money, sex and cocaine
Blue fuel, cigarettes and propane
Green, yellow, red light campaign
Quick moving, never choosing the slow lane

[Over the top of the final repeat of the bridge]
"Cause you can never go home anymore, listen"</pre>
