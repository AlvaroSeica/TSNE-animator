Chorus:

They protect they ki's,
They protect they herb,
But it's me that they tryin' to serve?
They protect they ki's,
They protect they herb,
But it's me that they tryin' to serve?
They protect they ki's,
They protect they herb,
But it's me that they tryin' to serve?
They protect they ki's,
They protect they herb,
But it's me that they tryin' to serve?
(What's the meaning of Protect and Serve?)

First Verse:

What's up Crooked Cop or Mr. Officer, whatever,
I don't know how to address you cuz you change like the weather,
Knowin' I sell dope, CD's, and dope tapes,
Tryin' to knock a nigga, now you know that shit fake,
I ain't tryin' to violate, but you tryin' to playa hate,
All in a nigga face, cuz I'm tryin' to paper chase,
I think them luxuries, make you fuck with me, but damn,
You hear my music, you be, pumpin' a nigga jams,
I think this whole system is a big money scam,
Here we go again, you want my name, and my social,
This shit is so commercial,
It's like, a rehearsal,
Time and time again,
They come off, cop robbin' friend,
Jackin' everything, I thought stealin' was a sin?
But I don't know, that's how it go up in our city,
Ain't it a pity that them laws be actin' shitty?

Chorus

Second Verse:

What's happenin'?
Crooked coppers, tryin' to drop us,
You can't stop us,
Put drugs in the neighborhood then turn around and try to pop us,
You bitches got warehouses full of that shit,
Y'all niggas runnin' that shit,
The only ones you protect, is the niggas pushin' your shit,
N.O.P.D handin' me a ki,
Told me bring 'em back twelve, first ki wholesale,
I said "Naw nigga, I ain't with that there bullshit",
Dope tapes and CD's, and that's bout it,
He didn't like that, everytime he sees me he pulls me over,
Said I was drivin' over the speed limit,
Didn't have a seat belt on and my windows tinted,
Now how can he see in it?
This shit they do, you want a headshot too?
Crooked, backward, sideways, whatever, the shit ain't sharp,
Old lady pissed him off, he bring his problems to his job,
Wanna scuff me up, wanna rough me up,
N.O.P.D. get caught with fifteen ki's,
What's the meaning of Protect and Serve?
