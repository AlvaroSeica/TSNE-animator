[Birdman]
Yeah nigga Fast Money, Cash Money
how we roll it out-is how we roll it in
know what I'm sayin nigga feel me nigga
we just hit a lick nigga
gotta bout 50 more years nigga
and I wanted to go fuck with a nigga
who broke bread with us first nigga so we flew to Houston ya holla!

[Bun B]
I jumped in the game with a 50 dollar sack
a heart full of hustle and my mind on stacks
I held my nuts in the game called crack
now I'm deep up in the streets and I ain't never lookin back
I gotta reputation I ain't gotta keep dealin it
a south nigga....give a fuck if you ain't feelin it
UGK for life bitch an underground boss
disrespect and that's a line you don't really wanna cross (Fa Real)
quick on the trigger, pull a pistol out quick on a nigga
one click blow the shit out a nigga (BLOAH)
been bout a figure ain't stoppin till I see it
don't hate me hoe cause that's the way I gotta G it
P.A.T baby that's me baby...Free Pimp C and that's real OG baby
this dedicated to my niggaz on lock
KS, Young Ryno, and the homie Lil'Block it don't stop

[Chorus 2X: Bun B]
Take a walk through my ghetto life (ghetto life)
let me show you that my ghetto's shiest (ghetto's shiest)
drug deals, and young niggaz gettin'killed
I ain't gotta tell you that my ghetto real

[6 Shot]
Uhhh look at here, uptown cut throat nigga
any year crisp and clear ya hear me now
nothin nice break you off with a style Fuh real
coke, dope, pills-it's no joke here
everybody strapped look at where I'm at (BLAT, BLAT)
nigga shits so real it's no doubt about it
all cowards get killed
fa sheezy while I'm sneakin through them people
forty four bags and them people
in that M-A-G-N-O dish it out or get from round L-I-A uptown

all cowards get killed ya know

[Chorus]

[Birdman]
Look you know them guns go to poppin
when them niggaz go to drop e'm
make e'm all run go to scatter nigga
cause when you fuckin with the man
he'll spend a few grands cause you know we puttin change on ya
yeah cause we thugged out, wigged out
came through the neighborhood with the guns out
nigga don't make me drop the top
don't give a fuck about the weather cause we still gon'shine nigga
yeah and that was changeable evidence homie
that's why they let Rufus go
and we was playin with paper nigga-and dropped 50 on the flo'nigga
so I spread my wings out came through the nieghborhood with the L's out
nigga and I'm tryin to get out
the dope game but I still let them birds out

[Chorus]
