[Madam Majestic]
Wanna dance, wanna dance?
Wanna move, wanna groove?
Wanna dance, wanna dance?
Wanna move, wanna groove?

[Xavier Naidoo]
Don't worry, I'll be back..
And before the night is over...
I will be with you again...
And we'll be dancing together...
Be it sunshine, be it rain...
Ooh, I don't need nothing...
If I can be with you...
Cuz your good loving...
It really sets me through
Yes, it does...

[Chorus 2X: Madam Majestic]
I think we can make it...
For the first time in my life
I think we can...
Nobody but us can take it...
This is what I feel tonight
I wanna dance all night...

[Xavier Naidoo]
Baby, baby...
You gotta be positive about this...
Yes, I know it's crazy, crazy...
And there's a lot more on top of this...
Just one more time, and then we'll leave
In and out, just like this...
One more time, then we're up
That's what this is all about...

[Chorus w/ Xavier Naidoo]

[Madam Majestic]
You are exactly what I need
Very special, V.S.O.P.
And I'm so happy that I got
A chance to rock with you, non-stop...

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
