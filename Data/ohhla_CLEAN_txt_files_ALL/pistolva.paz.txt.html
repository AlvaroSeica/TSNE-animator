[Intro: Jakk Frost]
Uh-huh, Frost
Uh-huh, Jedi Mind Tricks
Vinnie, solo shit, Free!
Yeah, yeah, the beards in the building!
Uh-huh, uh-huh, Philly in the building
Frost man got 'em chilly in the building
Uh-huh, yeah, shit, you know how I do it
Listen, uhh

[Jakk Frost]
I can show you how the nine spit
It's Frost, Freeway, and Vinnie from Jedi Mind Tricks
I'm on my grind trick
Niggaz flows is hot but Frost greater
Y'all niggaz don't exist like Luke without Vader
Got a young buck that remind me of Lando Calrissian
Smooth as Billy Dee when he sneak his pistols in
A Colt 45 it works every time
Vinnie out there drinkin on that (that's right)
I know they out there thinkin on that
Niggaz think about creepin on Jakk
Probably mad cause his main bitch creepin with Jakk
Every third weekend with Jakk, she sleepin with Jakk, how sleazy is that?
Y'all niggaz talk drugs but you ain't seen a brick yet
I've been touchin money since the kid who played kickstep
But a house party to me is a crib full of fiends
Ready to cop that zip-lock, ready rock

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Hip-Hop, started out in the park (that's right)
We used to do it when the weed would spark (uh-huh)
When the drinks start flowin and the green starts glowin
(If you from the hood I know you feel me, keep goin!)

[Vinnie Paz]
Louis Dog, yeah
Who the best muh'fucker in the street that you never heard
The 45 separate your head and it severs nerves
Call me Koko B. Ware, I carry several birds
I'll demolish enemy scholars with every deadly word
These muh'fuckers don't know the pain that the stainless doin
I'ma let em take it back to the block and explain it to 'em
Cut a muh'fucker head like Hussein would do him
Take his muh'fuckin bread now it's painless to him
And feed the pitbulls that man's bones
Cause I'm here to fuck the game up like Pac-Man Jones
I'm Kobe with rock, if not I'll fuckin zone in the spot
But if you disrespect my mother or my home then you shot
I'm lonely a lot, and that's the type of person who's deadly
And the 50 cal. make your face look like spaghetti
Look at this fetti, look at all this beautiful shit
A south Philly scumbag wearin Gucci and shit - it's over~!

[Chorus]

[Freeway]
This is Jakk Frost, it's your boy Vinnie, Philly +Freezer+
We do it proper cause hip-hoppers they really need us
I tote the semi if you warrin you will really see it
how loud a tough guy scream when he's shot
I ran terror from the same era as Biggie and 'Pac
This is rocker, we will block you, leave you paraplegic
You never there, I'm everywhere, I say I'm there then believe it
When you see me Louis Vuitton, gearin to drop, yeah!
Philly +Freezer+ get paper all year
New Year's I'm on the ball, I'll be there when it drops
These snitch niggaz, sayin I'm near when I'm not
Bet you when the bodies droppin they start callin the law
Roc-A-Fella heat spitters, Desert Eagle heat holders
Philly +Freezer+ keep soldiers that'll ride for the cause
The AK will heat niggaz, it'll flip your Jeep over
If these niggaz try me probably catch a body tomorrow
Yeahhhh! {*laughter*}

[Outro]
That's right! (Uh-huh)
BBRRAP, Philly! (Vinnie)
BRRAP, Freezer, early!
We got it locked niggaz
(Frost where you at cuz-o?) Yeah
Send this package on the way, that's right
Frost, Free, Vinnie
Beards in the building!
