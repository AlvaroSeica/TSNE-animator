Hey Chris, John Bowie, long time no talk man, what's up?
Uh, just driving around thinking of you
Heard you're doing a hip-hop record, uhh
for Tim, that's awesome man
wondering if I could, uh, get in on some of that action
Uh, lay down some fat rhymes as it were
Uh, the uh.. hey dude, watch where you're going!
Fuck~! Sorry man, I'm driving
Uh, listen, yeah, so I want to, uh, come in and uh
and, uh, join in with some of the, the dope beats
Uh, call me on my cell, I gotta play Harry Potter
at a children's birthday party
but that's not gonna be for a couple of hours
Maybe we can, uh, catch up later on, okay man?
So give me a call later on, we'll - we'll hook up
Nine one seven five three...
Hey! watch where you're goin - AHHHHH!! {*CRASH*}</pre>
