[Intro: Trey Songz]
Hey ladies! {*echoes*} Uh
I know you gotta feel me on this
You see there's somethin that's been worryin me
I need to get it off my chest
See when you got you a good man at home, don't you do him wrong
Cause I'ma tell you what he thinkin
Uh-huh huh... ooh-woo!

[Trey Songz]
It's 8:30, I know my baby kinda worried
I said I'd be there, said I'd make it in a hurry
But I ain't even on the way (I ain't even on the way) oh no
She thinkin home is so perfect (perfect)
But I guess it's cause her vision kinda blurry (ohh)
Cause she don't realize she do me so dirty (ohh)
And she don't recognize the things that she say

[Chorus One]
(Things you say) Ohh, can drive a man so crazy
Make him wanna leave your ass
Got one foot outside the door
I can't take it no more
Sometimes I wanna (walk away)
(And find another lady?) I do
Cause all the things I been doin for you

[Chorus Two]
I'm gettin tired of the - things you do
To make me wanna cheat on you (all I go throgh)
All I gone through
Make me wanna cheat on you (when you act a fool)
When you act a fool
You make me wanna cheat on you (and I know it ain't cool)
And I know it ain't cool
But I'm gonna cheat on you (youuu)

[Trey Songz]
It ain't worth it (no) you see my love you don't deserve it
You can take it, you can dish it, you can serve it
But when the tables turn on you (tables turn on you)
(I know) when every man deserves happines
(I know) when you're the reason that it happened all along
And I tried to look past it
Oh but it's the, it's the it's the

[Chorus Two]

[Trey Songz]
Hey ladies! (Hey ladies)
I know you gotta feel me on this (on this)
Things you say, can drive a man so crazy
Make him wanna leave your ass (Ohhhh)

[Chorus One] - first two lines

[Chorus Two] - 2X w/ ad libs

[Outro]
