[Shawn Wigs]
So we was bunk bed bro's, on prophecy
My physical and my life by three, a summertime baby
Seventy nine, hit the owl, Me, Chad, moms and old dad
Splurge on the lab, summer's was banging
Backyard, no courtyard, thank god, son, I made new friends
Til them Malboro projects, seen grams on the weekends
Times spun, from '85 to '91
Me and shorty had fun, son, we did what we done
Nights of '51, jipped be light on this cash
Fuck his fat ass, he smoked all the grass
Pool hopping, barbeques, a similar place in time
Where a dime was like six bones, quarter waters and snow cones
Catching late calls on payphones, yo, moms, I'll be home
In a minute, come home, and sneak back out
To Mike Chaos Jungle Juice parties in cold lakes
In the winters, kept my beard cold in snowflakes
And my diamond back moguls, little C-Wigs
On the loose, rocking my brother's old goose
And my Jordans, jeans, and earth worked at the factory
They laughed at me, but that's the way things had to be
The little dirty kid who cried in the tub
Talked back, slapping the mug, slept on the rug

[Chorus: Lenore]
Yesterday, all my trouble seem so far away
Now it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh I believe in yesterday...

[Shawn Wigs]
Son, I quote from the bricks, life's four years old
Thirty six months younger than my brother, I was bold
Ready for the likes of whatever came at me
I was happy, I learned big things from my daddy
Walked with a gangsta limp, from walking movies
Disrespect women for being around groupies
Soul in the Hole, with moms, played paddle ball
Left me in the park all day and broke a paddle ball
Little black boys, we chuck rocks and we threw 'em
Played rap music, grew up to be a true-in
1.4.0. stay beating beats on the table
We hip hop, three finger rings and a cable
Lounge brought the slang in my life, partying nights
Keeping it tight, we brothers for life
Til death do us, or them slugs run through us
We ready for the life and trials of Ray Lewis
My life showed me things I've never seen before
Hold the family, cuz I'm bout to run on tour
She my best friend lover, mother of my baby
Divine understanding the life, it's all gravy
Smile when you see me in the 6 hundr' Mercedes
Ten room mansion, she screamed 'I want babies'

[Chorus: Lenore]
Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh I believe in yesterday...
Why things had to change, I don't know, they not the same
Time has, come and gone, now I long, for yesterday
Yesterday...</pre>
