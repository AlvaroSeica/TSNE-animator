(*2Pac*)
I won't deny it, I'm a straight rider
You don't wanna fuck with me

(*talking*)
Uh yeah what, PJ uh what
Boss Hogg Outlawz what, here I go uh

[PJ]
PJ bitch, better ask somebody
Busting heads is my job, man this rapping's just a hobby
No this ain't no lodi-dodi, cause we are live shit
Never change for a bitch, what ya see is what ya get
Boss Hogg is my click, playa haters suck a dick
If I hear ya talking down, I'm putting a price on ya bitch
It ain't hard to get rich, you niggaz gotta want it
When my voice hit the mic, yo I murder my opponents
The truth hurts don't it bitch, take it like a man
I'm a winner, so pretenders can't roll like I can
The truth hurts don't it bitch, take it like a man
I'm a winner, so pretender can't roll like I can
The truth hurts don't it bitch, take it like a man
I'm a winner, so pretenders can't roll like I can
Like Nas said bitch, all I need is one mic
Turn a priest into a player, turn a nun to a dyke
On a first class flight, bout to meet with Tyra Banks
If she sucking I'ma stay, round trip if she ain't
Candy blue paint, what the Hogg niggaz roll
Leaving hoes pussy swoll, Northside still hold
See I'm in control, seeing big bank folds
While you scrubs on the bench, man I'm balling in the pro'
Like Slim I'm a thug, like Kyleon I'm a killer
I stack mail daily, I'm a Boss Hogg nigga
Name getting bigger, but the fame ain't shit
Time to fill up the vault, put my family on rich
PJ bitch, trill nigga rap hustling
Take it how you wanna, that's the end of discussion

[Hook - 2x]
(All I need is one mic), naw-naw I'ma need two
So I can show these bitch niggaz, what a gangsta can do
(All I need is two mics), naw-naw I'ma need three
So I can show these bitch niggaz, this gangsta in me

[Kyleon]
Pick out the spot, time and place to meet ya
So I can greet ya, and fuck up ya facial features
Replacing ya preachers, with two glocks you finna get grounded
We coming to your crib like cops, and we finna surround it
Keep fucking with me, and your ass finna get clowned quick
Cause ya ass out of line dog, you way out of bounds bitch
I know how this sound bitch, but I'm use to plex
Niggaz constantly shooting slugs, yeah I'm use to that
This ain't about the North or South, what type of excuse is that
Rayface we have a problem, and I got the solution to that
I hear these undercover brothers, with they speaking in they songs
Trying to do it on the cool, but really beefing in they songs
I thought we was grown men, say it directly to a nigga
Cause you sounding like women, especially to a nigga
I tell ya what Rayface, they better start respecting a nigga
I'm trying to be nice, I don't wanna have to check me a nigga
I tell ya what Rayface, they better start respecting a nigga
I'm trying to-(you don't wanna fuck with me), a-a-a nigga
I tell ya what Rayface, they better start respecting a nigga
I'm trying to be nice, I don't wanna have to check me a nigga
Hit they ass with the rifle, and have to stretch me a nigga
Or pull that thang let it rain, have to wet me a nigga
Niggaz quick to jump out, and hide they hands behind they back
And talk bullshit, and try hide flows behind the track bitch

[Hook - 2x]

[Lil' Mel]
Like a band major, I keep a instrument that'll make noise
Remind you on Blow, cock it and pop it and break jaws
I'm back, I told 'em Northside wasn't far
Boss Hogg Outlawz, we the law fuck the law
Daily told em, how we act a fool when we cruise
22 plus 2's, dripping trucks coated blue
Y'all done looked fucked you up nigga, they trailing gangsta like me
But G, so nigga don't be like me get like me
I'm the same nigga, that run game nigga
To the bitch you love, kiss her and go down and lick her
Hundred percent, real and with what I represent
There's no his tell but ends, if I hailed for ten
Hundred percent, real and with what I represent
There's no his tell but ends, if I hailed for ten
Hundred percent, real and with what I represent
There's no his tell but ends, if I hailed for ten
The Mel strangling beats, to the green and get money
The key he has to be, better never lasts
At least, niggaz stunting like they waterproof
Fuck with us get wet up, I'm in order shoot
