Typed by: OHHLA.com

electromagnetic beam, I get charged
rhymes I run right thru em like a big box of Trojan large
Mc's tried to hang but its a Brooklyn thang
poison slang, poison fang
poison pen let me begin, 
tryin to rhyme up in my cipher is gambilin
freestylin me g, I be buckwilin
you cant even challenge a nigga in my position
technician, renditions more freaky than Rick James
fly like airplanes thru all it remain the same
my cuts like Freddy Krueger
dont need a German Luger
but shoot more shit than Stern-ruger
dirty rottens comin thru punks cling to their guns
dont start none, there wont be none
cuz ahh...fuck around and it'll be tragic

Chorus
and I could rock a rhyme with just statik

devastating, I gotcha heart pulsating
ool-age, you need aid, ejaculating
rhymes like semen, Mc's is scheming
tryin to bag me baby black you must be beemin...
feenin, I dont know who gased ya head up
Im straight up, for less niggas have got wet up
Im on a mission, scrambling my enemies transmission
when he least expect it, run up in his h-q
hi I.Q., every verse is e-q ued
sliver like a snake, still you cant elued
the neba, but not caneza
its the toucha, no gun or God can protect ya
neither the scripture, choke like a boa constrictor
this is my house and I'll evict ya
big respect is automatic...black

Chorus

I'll snatch up your girlfriend, her friend and their friends
I got the game &amp; fame shake out the condoms
she's a victim, you shouldnt have that mouth dirty rotten
and for the longest we knew you were plotten
on the down fall, who stands tall, lick the balls
Im not like that, so I smash out pussy walls
on the low, oh no, on the high
I get high, praise to the most high
tried to battle me, step up &amp; die
like the arc of the covenant I electrify
petrify, intelligence I glorify
so devils are horrified
sprayin like pecticide, con commit suicide
step into my realm and be fried
by the statik.........
