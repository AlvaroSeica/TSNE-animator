[Intro - speaks about 17 seconds in]
This is international
Big mega radio smasher

[Chorus: will.i.am] + {Fergie}
I've, had, the time of my life
And I never felt this way before
And I swear, this is true
And I owe it all to you
{Ohh I've, had, the time of my life}
{And I never felt this way before}
{And I swear, this is true}
{And I owe it all to you-you}
{You-you-you-you-you-you-you-you}
{Youyouyouyouyouyouyouyou}
{Y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y}
"Dirty bit!" {*2X*}

[will.i.am]
I-I came up in here to rock
Light a fire, make it hot
I don't wanna take no pictures
I just wanna take some shots
So come on, let's goooo
Let's lose control
Let's do it all night
'til we can't do it no mo'
People rockin to the sound
Turn it up and watch it pound
We gon' rock it to the top
until the roof come burnin' down
Yeah, it's hot in hurrrr
The temperaturrrr
has got these ladies
gettin freaky-urrrr

[Fergie]
I got freaky freaky baby
I was chillin with my ladies
I didn't come to get bougie
I came here to get crazy
I was born to get wiiild
That's my styyyle
If you didn't know that
Well baby now you know nowwww

[Interlude]
Cause I'm.. havin..
A good, time, with you
I'm tellin you~!

[Chorus]

[Taboo]
All-all these girls, they like my swagger
They callin me Mick Jagger
I be Rolling like a Stone
Jetsetter, jetlagger
We ain't messin with no maggots
Messin with the baddest
chicks in the club
Honey, what's up?

[Apl.de.ap]
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who's the baddest of them all?
Yeah it's gotta be the Apl
I'm the mack daddy y'all
Haters better step back
Ladies {download your Ap'}
I'm the party application
Rockin' just like that

[Interlude]

[Chorus] w/ overdubs, sans "you" repeats

[Chorus] w/ more overdubs &amp; no "you" repeats

(DIRTY BIT!)

[Outro]
Welcome~! This is the beginning
For every ending, is mega starter
When they bring the dark
We bring the life, let's go</pre>
