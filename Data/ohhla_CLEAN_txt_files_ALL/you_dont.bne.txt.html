Typed by: Ibabyboyboo@aol.com

[Krayzie]
Yeah, what's up, baby?
Before we even get into this
I want ya to know one thing
I don't own you, and you don't own me (Gotcha)
Keep it like that

(Chorus: Potion)
You don't own me, and I don't own you
Let's keep it like that

[Krayzie]
Cool
We can keep it like that
I like it like that

[Potion]
I heard you tell your boys
"She's under control," but you got me faded
You must think I am crazy
You walk around tryin' to play
These games like you got it goin' on
And you're keepin' things strong
I don't understand why you say the things you do
'Cause if you were takin' care of your business
I wouldn't be thinkin' of someone new
Yeah, I know you gave me all the money
And new car, but things won't control me
Good love will hold me

(Chorus)

[Potion]
This can never be an everlastin' love
If I'm you're object, 'cause I'm a new woman
What ya see is what you'll get
So, get yourself together
If you wanna be with me forever
I'm lettin' my love run free
I'm tellin' you - you don't own me

[Krayzie]
Hey, baby, you don't own me
Krayzie never was for sale
Bet you thought you had a package
But I ain't that type of male
I'm a grown man
Little girl, you better go on playin'
No chains or no ropes
Or no ties is what the song sayin'
If you listened, paid attention
You would've heard it when I mentioned
You're killin' me with your jealous comments
Now, are you suspicious?
It'd be best if you just go on about your way
Have a nice day
Yes, we should break
'Cause you can't get with a thug in my way

(Chorus)

[Potion]
You don't own me
You don't own me, baby
You don't own me, and I don't own you
Let's keep it like that
Let's keep it like that</pre>
