[Intro]
{*barking*} Awww yes
Who the fuck are you?

[Verse One]
Erotic features
Girl without the vibe it's like The Mack
The top of the bleachers, #85 the quarterback
I'm waitin to meet ya, pull me out the class
DJ this detention will reach ya with ponytails
Put coolie in the back, I need to tell ya somethin
Right now girl I'm as nervous as Peyton Manning
with the whole world waitin to tell me can't win the big one
Institute your glamour and show me that I'm the one
for your daughter and son to give it to
And provided the brew with the only I can ignore ya
He's sinister, when it comes to the furniture, he's a damager
Sex on every bannister - why? Cause she concludes
that I'm the ultimate dude, last night ruled

[Chorus]
Remembering, these things, I know (last night ruled)
The best of times, we had, fo' sho' (last night ruled)

[Verse Two]
Not perfect planning, spontaneous, my shit do it phenomenal
Even that we must chronicle, no video just memory
Leaving nothing admissable, Vegas trip never happened
Ain't gon' matter what's on your physical, find that, find the head
With spiritual preperation as holy as we can get
(Don't matter with that) you can see the early intervention
of parasol and backpack, spinning stunning stunting
We'll keep on waiting as long as tragedies are permitting
Remember beginning, never recognizing that their ending
I'm having a blast (so bang and so cool on yo' ass)
(Last night ruled)

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
The evenings they flow like moving never Spongebob's pet
Gary to go, and acclimation confirmation they remember the show
We all enjoyed exuberation
Where women involved, no histrionic masturbation
Fight Club abrasions like you stayed alive was real amazing
Euthanasia, brain cells in order agin
Complex equations, sober felt it John Blazin
Situation creating, last night ruled
(Common effect, everybody see it on my face)
(Looking around) last night ruled
(Everybody see it on my face looking around)
Last night ruled

[Chorus]

[Outro]
These things I know
We had fo' show
Motion, you are not the father!
{*barking*}
Everybody see it on my face looking around {*2X*}
Common effect, everybody see it on my face looking around
Everybody know I smoke weed just to get high</pre>
