Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

* lighter flicked *		* herbals inhaled *
* some coughing *		* speaking through weed *
Ahh man, this shit is ill
Ahh this shit is butter right here kid
This that old flav kid

[Nine]
I enter the room with the bang and the boom
and the tune where heat fumes, hot like June
I represent the Bronx to the fullest, New York is the essence
I've been writin rhymes since my adolescence
Hip-Hop gives me love and I give it right back
If your shit is wack I must attack
Send lead to your head oh what a bloody mess it's gon' be
That's the flav, when a rapper tries to step to an MC
My skills are grown like a dreadlock
I got mad intelligence, so it just won't STOP!
You could never in your life slice a brick with a butterknife
You're livin trife, that's aight, my crew loves to fight
Bring the noise, and watch me turn down the volume
like chicka-pow, buck buck buck, chicka-BOOM!
Not the one to step to, not the one to test
It'll be a bloody mess

Chorus: Nine {sing-song, with his crew}

Yo that's that AHHH-ahhh-AHHH-ahh shit, shit!
C'mon, c'mon! [AHHH-ahhh-AHHH-ahh SHIT, SHIT!]
Yo that's that AHHH-ahhh-AHHH-ahh shit, shit!
C'mon, c'mon! [AHHH-ahhh-AHHH-ahh SHIT, SHIT!]

[Nine]
I get mad when niggaz try to play me like I'm stupid
I start shootin like a revolution, or Cupid
I don't miss, infrared type thing goin on
I drop a bomb like Hiroshima with my nina
then move my razor blade like a crossfade on your jawline
Understand, Nine is Optimus Prime
Follow the leader with the speed of, a cheetar
You want a fair one nigga?  Put up your dick beater
Your hands are flesh and bone, my hands are flesh bone
Everybody bleeds, but some fear vocal tones
The devil didn't make me do it, YOU made me do it
You're spreadin rumors like a bitch
so I cut off your switch
Left you bleedin, and needin
medical attention with a hole in your head, I forgot to mention
I react like a rattlesnake when under stress
It'll be a FUCKIN mess

Chorus

[Nine]
Who's the soul survivor, who gets liver than the
numba won contender, Nine that's me, real MC from the Boogie Down B
Underrated suckers hated the fact that I woke up like King Tut
Recognize that you're BUTT!
Cut the crap, my rap as old as dirt, you get hurt
I fill in blanks like piranhas in goldfish tanks
Niggaz is walkin the plank off the Empire State Building
I broadcast, quick fast, to fuck that ass!
Leave you brainless when I pull out the stainless steel
Word life son, ahh, shit is real..

[AHHH-ahhh-AHHH-ahh SHIT, SHIT!]
[AHHH-ahhh-AHHH-ahh SHIT, SHIT!]
[AHHH-ahhh-AHHH-ahh SHIT, SHIT!]
[AHHH-ahhh-AHHH-ahh SHIT, SHIT!]
[AHHH-ahhh-AHHH-ahh SHIT, SHIT!] *music starts to fade*
[AHHH-ahhh-AHHH-ahh SHIT, SHIT!]
[AHHH-ahhh-AHHH-ahh SHIT, SHIT!]
[AHHH-ahhh-AHHH-ahh SHIT, SHIT!]</pre>
