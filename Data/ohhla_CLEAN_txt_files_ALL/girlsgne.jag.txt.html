Ah hey ay ay 
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, ay ay (J.E.)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, ay ay (J)

Now I met this little girl in Daytona
Spring breakin' with my dawgs I was on her
(Didn't give a chance) 
To let another dude get on her
Ya'll know I came with my mack game
Hood like a crap game

I caught her early, I was sober 
That mean my thoughts going alright 
And my words flowin' nice and
When she movin', got me on the fly
Get ready for take off 
Them clothes got to break off

1 - 	Got her gigglin' and laughin' 
	And I know she knows what's happening
	She can tell by the way I'm rapping 
	Gotta rap this up baby, that's what's up, girl

2 - 	Little mama, she like a girl gone wild
	Can't miss the girl, she stand out in a crowd and
	Young and sexy with that freaky, freaky style
	Walked through the party, make the club buck wild and

 	Little mama, she like a girl gone wild
	Her and all her girls stand out in the crowd
	Young and sexy with that freaky, freaky style
	Walked through the party, make the club buck wild and

 	Say hey ay ay
	Ah hey ay ay 
	Yeah yeah yeah yeah, ay ay
	Yeah yeah yeah yeah, ay ay

Now when I met her she was sippin' a Corona
And I was really really feelin' her persona
(Didn't have a chance)
I knew I hadda put it on her
Cuz I gets down like a stickup
Everybody put your hands up

I ain't really tryna hurt nobody (Nope)
But I was taken by her bangin' body (Yup)
Lovin' her could really be my hobby
I already got her laughin', I'm about to cash in

Repeat 1
Repeat 2

It's those girls gone wild
(Something 'bout a little mama goin' wild on me)
Little bit freaky, but it's just my style
Stylin', she be killing me with her smile
Truthfully speaking, yeah she is buck wild so

It's those girls gone wild
Little bit freaky, but it's just my style
Stylin', she be killing me with her smile
Truthfully speaking, yeah she is buck wild
And that's it so
