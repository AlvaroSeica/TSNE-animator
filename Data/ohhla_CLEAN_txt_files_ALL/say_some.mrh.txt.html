[Snoop] (Mariah)
Yeah, say somethin' (ooh)
Say somethin', say somethin', yeah, damn (ohh)
Say somethin', say somethin', damn (oooh, ohh, yeah)

[Mariah] (Snoop)
I'm over here looking at you
You are over there watching me too
Both painting pictures of, of how we'll kiss and hug
So what we gon' do (so whatcha gon' do, so whatcha gon' do)
Tell me why we're standing here
The moment's passions all so clear
You've got my mind blown and baby I'm ready to go

[Mariah]
But uh
If it's worth your while say somethin', say somethin'
If it's worth your while say somethin' good to me
Hey hey hey, hey, hey
If it's worth your while do somethin' good to me

[Mariah] (Snoop)
Hot as you can stand it, something like volcanic
You and me seems organic just like the stars and planets
Yeah, we are, so what you gon' do
(So whatcha gon' do, whatcha gon' do)
Tell me why we're still in here
There's nothing for us to fear
I could tell with my eyes closed, now baby I'm ready to go

[Mariah]
But uh
If it's worth your while say somethin', say somethin'
If it's worth your while say somethin' good to me
Hey hey hey, hey, hey
If it's worth your while do somethin' good to me
If it's worth your while say somethin', say somethin'
If it's worth your while say somethin' good to me
Hey hey hey, hey, hey
If it's worth your while do somethin' good to me

[Snoop]
Everytime I follow, want me to speak on the word or two
It's the D-O, double-G, and I do it so lover-ly
Diggin' this track by the Neptunes
Baby girl follow me to the rest room
Now get buck wild, shh, don't make a sound
I'll take you, lay you down
Make your body go round and round
Do you want me to, don't say you won't, I know you do
Most girls play shy, it won't hurt until you give it a try
I know you like my smile
Dig my style, dig the bow wow

[Mariah]
But uh
If it's worth your while say somethin', say somethin'
If it's worth your while say somethin' good to me
Hey hey hey, hey, hey
If it's worth your while do somethin' good to me
If it's worth your while say somethin', say somethin'
If it's worth your while say somethin' good to me
Hey hey hey, hey, hey
If it's worth your while do somethin' good to me</pre>
