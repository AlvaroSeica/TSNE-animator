[Intro: P.R. Terrorist]
Holy water, heh, what?

[P.R. Terrorist]
Master my craft, flashback on lyricist crash
Hid behind the moon, waited into midnight to blast
The earth, a comet from out the holy skirts
Ain't an over night surprise, the Gods put in work
Paid the price, got jerked, seen Divine even smirk
Heard the pistol pop with a chirp, while my wit' murk
Transform into a jet, spiders throw in they nets
Try to intercept the war vet, who never submit
Terrorist shit, told you before, don't fuck with it
Every thought that's conceived, ain't easy to transmit
Highjack the ship, brought impact when I attack it
Complex minds, can only project, the extracted
The purest form, my verse can climax to the song
After The Swarm, then they felt the Killarm' bomb

[Chorus: Islord]
Holy water, we baptized, get your whole franchise
Dumped your head into the honey of my beehive
A hundred stings, had you paralyzed
A hundred stings, had you paralyzed

[P.R. Terrorist]
Yo, yo, them, I can't trust, walk dark streets and smoke dust
Achieved out, bust my gun until it rusts
From the black rain, holy water run through my vein
Snake &amp; Crane strike your vitals and pain, wick' in the brain
Try and act strong headed, these thoughts will leave you deaded
Took time to manifest what was war, the day I said it
Magnetic minds, attracted my kind, others are blind
Try'nna find, the truth and the lie, open your eyes
U N I Verse, Allah's Knowledge, Knowledge is first
Time to disperse, this Devilish curse, put it on the Earth
Bring all men together, the risk, followed by Tera Iz Forever
No title, I'm God, without no letter, just the aura
Mental explorer, lyrics are rawer than a rough cut
Bear back dick, fucking a slut
All words come from the pit of my gut
Just like my nut

[Chorus 2X]

[Outro: Islord]
Goin' against the wise men... the wise men
The wise men... the wise men..</pre>
