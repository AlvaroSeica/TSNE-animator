Typed by: Metro Lyrics

Swing my way
Let me take you somewhere that I'm headed, baby
You can play
Treat you like my hustle, you know I'll be on that all day

I'm on the block serving yay to make it straight
You my bae
You my bae
You my bae

Ambitious, I am vicious
If you watching arms in the party you can't miss us
Watch this galore, ladies watch us for sure
Top of the floor, vodka bottles to pour
Rock with your boy, we can sail out to Malibu
Her swag powerful, Channel flower, you
Goddamn, who be styling you?
Like I wish I was you, tell 'em to look our view
I love the flow, it's a Harlem thing
I blow trial, they watch the court, no college game
I done did keys, that's not a thing
I run these MCs like all these queens
When the air thinner, you found me
Can tell you don't travel, you need a trip out the county
If I'm that nigga then crown me
This ain't like I have a problem having women around me

Swing my way
Let me take you somewhere that I'm headed, baby
You can play
Treat you like my hustle, you know I'll be on that all day

I'm on the block serving yay to make it straight
You my bae
You my bae
You my bae

On the boardwalk, I'm feeling like...
Lot of women I ran through
If I want a click that's something I make his man do
Balls talk since day one
Used to play the block with a rock J...
Was too young hoping my day come
Now I'm pulling up with the baddest
So bad that she made the moment a classic
So sad that she killing them in them classic
We call them throwaways but baby

Swing my way
Let me take you somewhere that I'm headed, baby
You can play
Treat you like my hustle, you know I'll be on that all day

I'm on the block serving yay to make it straight
You my bae
You my bae
You my bae

Tuxedoes and bowties
Black tie affair, yeah, we so fly
No matter where we go by
What you wanna wear, we can go by
You want hustler? Put your hands up
Ladies, I'm loving you, won't you stand up?
We taking over like and what?
This the taking over, you man up

Swing my way
Let me take you somewhere that I'm headed, baby
You can play
Treat you like my hustle, you know I'll be on that all day

I'm on the block serving yay to make it straight
You my bae
You my bae
You my bae

Let me take you somewhere that I'm headed, baby
You can play
Treat you like my hustle, you know I'll be on that all day

I'm on the block serving yay to make it straight
You my bae
You my bae</pre>
