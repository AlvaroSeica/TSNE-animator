[Makeba Mooncycle]
Who is this I see, sneaking up on me?
Maybe it's the man, came here to change my plans?
Conspiracies are really theories, made up
By masterous plans of a recapture
Natural disasters, made to trap ya
Virgins fronting like they don't want it
Shit's so real, you know I'm on it
Who will be the first to quench their thirst?
Leaving MC's hurt in a blast, like dessert
I rock the mic, like I was freeing people
Snatched the devil, took the D and made 'em evil
If I see you, that's means I already saw
Like the all eye seeing, putting the R into raw
Smashing bells, cuz I kill that noise
Can't get around me, yes I'm hard to avoid
Talking good living, have you seen it yet?
I wait for paradise, looking forward to death
My heart can't rest, something other than stress
So I detest, get protection like a vest
The border-line suspects, crooked, walk vexed
Too many games, who's getting over on me next?
Ya life for another man's gain, the only one to blame
Getting caught up in the fame, will only leave you slame
I must maintain, that's true
Take cover, before the rain I'm through

[Chorus 2X: Makeba Mooncycle, J. Sands]
What you gonna do when Wu comes for you?
What you gonna do when U.K. sprays ya crew?
What you gonna do? Mad I hold shit down?
The Sun, Moon set, came to lock shit down

[Makeba Mooncycle]
This warrior endangered, see, I have no fear
I need some answers, let's make this clear
Will I be here tomorrow? I really don't care
I'll always take a challenge, no need to be scared
I'm giving this, a test of balance, prepare for the challenge
Come creep with me through the valley of the beast
Be careful what you speak, you might feel the heat
We're taking over like governments, this is a rhyme well spent
Share my mind like reality, dark side backs me
What you gonna do when I'm coming for you?
Ya yelling for ya crew, 'bout to tell the truth
But we can get it on like the song
Death like napalm, word is bond
If you look, you might get shook, dig into my books
There's no one to save ya, not minor but major
We're all there to raise ya, the streets is what made ya

[Chorus 2X]

[Makeba Mooncycle]
Armageddon's 'bout to come, what you gonna do, baby?
For me I'm being Swaze, fuck it, call me crazy
While you remain lazy, I'll be gun ho like Lacie
And Cagnee, young society's got my back, see?
All assed out, not knowing who to believe
Ya smiling in my face with tricks up ya sleeve
I protect new life, ya not corrupting these
Only truth I feed, no lies are taking me
I come real with these, you best take heed
Drop to ya knees, pray for the new breed
Raise ya young, plant a seed, no sadness, don't grieve
My lyrics are the source, it's time to break north
I'm here to change that, change Lef to 'Rack
Revolution means set it, we can all be deaded
In all reality I've got nothing to lose
Preparing for now, get ready for the two's
I'ma teach my seed, to protect his own
And if you trust past, shoot straight for ya dome
It's time to send 'em home, putting holes in my zone
Who's right? Who's wrong? Calm before the storm
As I enter ya scope without the false hope
The darkness to the light, my strength backs my mic
Never out of sight, are you ready to take flight?
Are you ready to take flight, or fight? What?

[Chorus 3X]

[Outro: Makeba Mooncycle (J. Sands)]
What you gonna do?
(Yeah, what you gonna do when we come for ya?) Uh-huh
(What you gonna do when we come for ya?) Uh-huh
(What you gonna do when we come for ya?) What?
(Ya, ya, ya...) It's the Lone Catalysts
The J. Sands to the Bones, never let us spawn
The Morgue Foundation, Dungeon Masta
A droit, allegiance on point
Prodigal Sizunn, G-Lock to the Coins
We be the joint, Brooklyn forever, baby
Behold, Wu family, too tight
We coming for you, you better grab ya babies
Grab ya books, we leaving everybody shaking...</pre>
