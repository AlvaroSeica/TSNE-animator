I can be the treble baby 
You can be the bass 
You can be the bass 
You can be the bass 
(x4) 

Hey 
You see me down on the floor 
I want you to take me higher 
Till I can't take it no more 

It's gettin bigger 
The bass is gettin bigger 

And now 
You see me up in the sky 
I was rockin' the bottom 
Now look at me I can fly 

It's gettin bigger 
The bass is gettin bigger 

I can be your treble baby 
You can be my bass 
You can be my bass 
You can be my bass 
(x2) 

It's gettin bigger 
The bass is gettin bigger 
(x4) 

The bass is getting low 
The bass is getting low 
The bass is getting low 

I-I-I-I-It's gettin bigger 
The bass is gettin bigger 

Hey 
You see me out in the night 
Wanna go out dancing 
So I can feel alright 

It's gettin bigger 
The bass is gettin bigger 

Yo 
Take me out in the lights 
I wanna have me a good time 
The bass is feelin nice 

It's gettin bigger 
The bass is gettin bigger 

I can be your treble baby 
You can be my bass 
You can be my bass 
You can be my bass 
(x4)

Yeah 
Yeah 
Yeah 
Y'all better get ready for the kick drum 
For the kick drum 
For the kick drum 
Y'all better get ready for the kick drum 
For the kick drum 
For the kick drum 

Yo it's the kick drum 
Come and get some 
The sound that's rockin' your system 
When it pounds it cause an addiction 
Y'all better have a prescription 
Me and Brit got the whole club trippin' 
They sit and wait and listen 
For the kick drum 
For the kick drum 
For the kick drum 
For the kick drum 
For the big big fat fat bass 
Rockin' all in your face 
Vibrate your cup 
Right now let's get crazy 
Here we go 
Here we go 
Here we go 
Everybody in the place get frantic 
This beat right here's gigantic 
Yo 

It's gettin bigger 
The bass is gettin bigger 
(x4) 

I can be your treble baby 
You can be my bass 
You can be my bass 
You can be my bass 
(x4)</pre>
