(Wise Intelligent)
I Self Lord and my crew
Coming through
Gotta' teach what we taught to each other
I swore upon my crown
That I'd down any clown
So this one's dedicated to the style thieving suckers
Here comes the wise man
Methods of dropping' mental
But no one open doors
For I self Lord and master
Have to be an independent source of life and matter
Why just for me to matter
Or just for you to listen
Some can't figure me 
They say I'm just too complicated
They ask me what my age
Then I have no recollection
They ask me "what religion?"
But religions not important 
Principle, culture, nation
Civil law and order
I'm checking
I self lord and the P-R-T P-ossee see it
Every style we drop some one come thief it!
But I don't understand why some of us can't be creative
We hail from New Jerusalem, but others see no nation
Smile as they ????? .Hmmm Sit back and meditate 
It's that simple

(Culture Freedom)
POWWW!!!

Some of we have waited
For someone such as myself
To go all mental
My methods of dropping' mental
Listen to the teacher
As the teacher
Proceeds to drop into the style
While I profile mine
I often find
Many people ask me teacher how did you know this?
And I respond hmmm
Knowledge, wisdom, understanding, culture, plus refinement
We're no savages
In pursuit of happiness
Culture Freedom always often use to tell me "Wise Intelligent they're lacking"
Well then it's time for them to blacken
Wake up to the fact I teacher that of God
The Supreme Being
Teacher, King 
Same thing
King sit upon the throne 
Rule wisely
Justly
Plus thee 
Crown of creation
Making music

(Culture Freedom)
For the fools

(Wise Intelligent)
Casting jewels
Simply taking them to school
Say the teacher
The crown of life bears knowledge
Polish up a sucka'
Inna' automatic second 
See it's  SIMPLE!

(Wise Intelligent)
Once again
Yes my friend
Here's Methods of dropping mental
Simple it may be
But some say opposite
This is what you get 
From Divineland
New Jerusalem dropping it
Some come swapping it
Snakes in the meadow
Grass cut low
When the snake's head show
The snake's head go
See I don't mess around with no snake
Cause I'm the snake's meat 
Greet me
Then he beats me
For something I created
Maker and the owner of the style
So I profile like I made it
It takes an A plus to grade it
Wise come flashing the style of fashion
And I sometimes think
About the purified words, ways, actions
????? Just to show and prove that I posses these first
The mental principles of the universe
Weight that of knowledge
Culture say "on with"
And I proceed
Now one's own need
Greed
Envy, lust, jealousy
Will kill a man 
It's that simple.
Well umm yes
I understand it takes a teacher to explain the very essentials
