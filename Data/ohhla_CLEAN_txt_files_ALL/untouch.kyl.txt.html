[Kyleon]
I see your click mugging, looking with a frowning face
You're like a birthday party, full of clowns and cakes
I see your click mugging, looking with a frowning face
You're like a birthday party, full of clowns and cakes
I see your click mugging, looking with a frowning face
You're like a birthday party, full of clowns and cakes
The type that won't fight, but keep a gun around your waist
Ain't finna do shit, but always running your mouth
Don't make me, run in your house and you ain't leaving
Till the coroner come, and when you ain't breathing
From H-Town to Cleveland, Killa's a menace
I'm all in these niggaz faces, like Killa's a dentist
You can find me in the spot, if it's some scrilla  up in it
With the work, and the cocked nine mili' up in it
I hang with a gorilla unit, like Buck and Banks
That'll put niggaz to sleep, like they fucked with Dre
Fuck what you think, Kyleon running the show
I'm a lyrical Jet Li, I'm the one with the flow
And if you looking for your chick, I'm the one with your hoe
And I ain't gotta ask for head, she done befo'
It's a hundred and fo' outside, I'm the reason
When I told you I was hot, niggaz didn't believe me
Now they tripping, cause they see that I'm the shit in they region
And I'ma keep making moves mayn, I ain't freezing
You wonder why I'm G'sing, look at my check
Can't you see I'm having thangs mayn, look at my neck
Niggaz can't see Killa, cause I ain't visible yet
So I guess, you can just call me invisible set nigga
