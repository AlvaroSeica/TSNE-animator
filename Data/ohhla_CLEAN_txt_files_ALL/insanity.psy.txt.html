[B-Real]
You better dig deep and find soul
'Cause you're lost, need guidance, which way to go
People are despicable, unpredictable spirits
Calling out so all you weak-minded hear it
To take control over your mind and body
Hip-hop is more than just a flow in a party
Strike down the unoriginal hypocrites
Let 'em burn at the stake like chicken strips
Fried cut up denied respect
Some have lost their lives and ided through their neglect
May they all rest in peace where they lay
Where we continue to struggle and live our lives day to day

[Chorus: B-Real]
What do you see when you're looking into the eyes of a madman
on the verge of insanity?
Looking out the window I see the animals in the darkness
the fearless, the scandalous, the heartless

[Sick Jacken]
The heartless roam bare chests, woman with bare breasts
Hollow, follow the sun God, Apollo, wake up tomorrow
with yellow eyes seeing visions of explicit visits
to the other side with precision
temporarily losing my head stedily
falling heavily on my shoulders
getting me on my achilles heel, I fell
like somebody pulled the plug from my brain
signals indicate I'm on my way, open the gates, be insane
psycho babble, constant battle with myself
pop the top on the pain killers on the top shelf
I need help to maintain my mental health
but overall, I'm doing what it takes to get my shoe in the door
from two charectors behaving like bad actors
not sticking to their roles causing more drama after
the show is over, I feel like a soldier
caught between two brigades
which one am I to aid

[Chorus: B-Real]
What do you see when you're looking into the eyes of a madman
on the verge of insanity?
Looking out the window I see the animals in the darkness
the fearless, the scandalous, the heartless

[Mr. Duke]
If there's ever road ahead, then cars will be crashing
high in front of their lives flashing by
no time to ask why
you know how it is in the city we roam
you're crazy, therefore you're making me go cyclone
all pursuits go in a stole Lo-lo
followed by the rival L.A. 5-O
narcs are led to the dark, then brought down
to the concrete around downtown
I personally take care of
all you wicked ass hollywood sheriffs
what if one night you just come
beating on a wicked drum?
I'm going through a quick view of what I thought
was my mind being torn apart?

[Chorus: B-Real]
What do you see when you're looking into the eyes of a madman
on the verge of insanity?
Looking out the window I see the animals in the darkness
the fearless, the scandalous, the heartless
