[Intro] 
Hello? Are we recording? (AAHH!)
Great, great. Can I tell you a little story? (Turn it up)
It's about this girl named Harmony
Yeah, (I can't hear anything) Yeah I know.
Put your hands up
Put your hands up (I'm sick of this!)
Yeah, I know
(Turn it up, bro)
Just sit back little boy
Let me teach you something
Let me teach you something

[Verse One]
Hop, skip, jump. she was a freak, right
The name's Pigeon John
I can treat her right
Went over to her, thought I could complete her, right
I know what I'm doing, don't need no advice
I said, "Hello, it's very nice to meet you.
I was searching, looking for a chance to greet you.
Maybe not so much, so maybe I could reach you
You don't know much about me, maybe I could teach you."
She said, "Cool", I said "Okay", beautiful
I was feeling Eddie Murphy-like beautiful
The blue sky, everything was very beautiful
Including her, she walked off pursuable 

[Chorus]
It's the chase (What am I to do but pursue?)
It's the chase (Everthing is so brand new)
It's the cha-a-a-ase (oh boy)
It's the cha-a-a-ase (oh boy)
It's the chase (I don't have a chick on my arm)
It's the chase (I was no match from the start)
It's the cha-a-a-ase (oh boy)
It's the cha-a-a-ase (oh boy)
It's the chase

[Verse Two]
We meet for lunch, her and my homeboys
Ordered a drink, now I'm in the zone, boy
She's smiling, grinning, now I'm on my own, boy
Talk her to her like on telephone, boy
Slow motion reaching for the ketchup, right
Second later, get a refill on the cup, right
Little mix of Mt. Dew and 7-Up, right
Everything was just smooth and not uptight
And now I introduce her to my friends, dude
I should'nt have introduced her to my friends, dude
Cause they all acting like they can get it too
And now I'm getting angry at my stupid crew

[Chorus]

It's the chase (What am I to do but pursue?)
It's the chase (Everthing is so brand new)
It's the cha-a-a-ase (oh boy)
It's the cha-a-a-ase (oh boy)
It's the chase (I don't have a chick on my arm)
It's the chase (I was no match from the start)
It's the cha-a-a-ase (oh boy)
It's the cha-a-a-ase (oh boy)
It's the chase

[Verse Three]
We walked away, a very lovely afternoon
I said "You're very nice and maybe we can hookup soon."
She didn't say nothing back, humm
I wish I could take back when I said like a vacuum
She said "That would be cool, I guess, yo. 
But what about your homeboy? Is he single?
Cookbook, that dude from Puerto Rico. 
You're a nice guy, but he's making me think, yo."
I like her
A-a-a-and she likes him
A-a-a-and what am I to do?
A-a-a-and gotta, gotta win (Hawthorne!)

[Chorus]
It's the chase 
It's the chase (Forget it!)
It's the cha-a-a-ase (This doesn't make no sense!)
It's the cha-a-a-ase (Ahh, Aagh.. Doesn't make no sense!)
It's the chase (I don't have a chick on my arm)
It's the chase (I was no match from the start)
It's the cha-a-a-ase (Ahh, Aggh!)
It's the cha-a-a-ase (oh boy)

It's the chase (go run along boy, go run along boy) [6x]
It's the...fill in the blank. Fill in the blank</pre>
