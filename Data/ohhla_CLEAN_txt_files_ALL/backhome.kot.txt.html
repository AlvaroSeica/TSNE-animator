Song:   Back Home
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

My world is rumbling
And tumbling
And crumbling down
They keep on running me
And running me
Right into the ground
Can someone tell me please
Tell me please
Is this the end?
Because I got to know
I got to know
I got to know now

Some say that life is a journey
So haters on the side lines don't concern me
They wanna burn me but they never will
I'm a loaded xpistol yes I shoot to kill
Places my boots and I get the steppin
Walk with respect to the roughin section
My secret weapon is love and compassion
Pack the peace pipe I just keep on laughing
I got places to go
I got people to see
Evil forces that are following me
I show no fear and I never look back
Cause home sweet home is where my heart is at

When the song comes to an end
Were going back to where it begin
I'm going back home
Yeah
Sittin down
Fire on a saturday night
Walkin up to the people driving by
Now that's back home

Now
I know whatcha thinkin
But you might be wrong
This ain't just another
Chance to make a P-Town song
They say your home is where
You hang your heart and that's true
But it's also havin friends and family next to you
It's not were you grew up shit it could be were you at now
I'm only saying
Think about it yours
Your hometown
I guess for me tho
Placentia is kinda easy cause
Both of my parents stilllive in placentia city

When the song comes to an end
Were going back to where it begin
I'm going back home
Yeah
Sittin down
Fire on a saturday night
Walkin up to the people driving by
Now that's back home

Maybe we'll fly
Beyond the blue horizon
Maybe in time
This will all go away
All go away
I'm going home
Yeah, yeah
I'm headin home to theplace that I rest
A feeling that I get when I arrive
It's always the best
Lots of family and friends
Alot of stuff and events
A feelin of achieve
For now it descend
To back woods were
I don't talk at all
Where ever green trees
Ten stories tall
And I know they will never ever
Try shot me back
And now I can close my eyes and relax
Into the deep woods
Where my whole life begin
Where the world forever
Ever ever talk my hand
And I know it won't never
Try to shoot me back
And now I can close my eyes and relax
Yeah

When the song comes to an end
Were going back to where it begin
I'm going back home
Yeah
Sittin down
Fire on a saturday night
Walkin up to the people driving by
Now that's back home

Take me
Take me
Back home
I packed all my stuff
And now it's time for me to go
I throw it in the trunk said goodbye
And hit the road
I meant alot of folks
But now it's time for me to leave
It's nothin like the northwest but kali is all I see
I just left donkeys
And I hit the 97
I gotta get some meds
I'm a stop at kevins
So doctor doctor
I think I need a fix
It's the magic box
Now it's time to hit heaven

When the song comes to an end
Were going back to where it begin
I'm going back home
Yeah
Sittin down
Fire on a saturday night
Walkin up to the people driving by
Now that's back home

My world is rumbling
And tumbling
And crumbling down
They keep on running me
And running me
Right into the ground
Can someone tell me please
Tell me please
Is this the end?
Because I got to know
I got to know
I got to know now

Maybe we'll fly
Beyond the blue horizon
Maybe in time
This will all go away
All go away
I'm going home</pre>
