We will
 
[Intro]
 
We in the new era, Sword &amp; Shield 
Sword &amp; Shield It's all to the real
It's all for the thrill It's all for the kill 
 
[Chorus]
Yo-
We will rise we will ride 
We don't die we don't cry 
Only spread our wings and just fly 
While you just try, just cry, just die 
 
We will rise we will ride 
We don't die we don't cry 
Only spread our wings and just fly 
While you just try, just cry, just die 
 
[Verse 1]
You can king-crown me, endow me Bloodhound me, surround me 
Get judged, bounties and county's, money makers and mounties 
You get bodied Lobbies with Tommy's Murder sloppy and copy 
Kat killa', cap peeler, blast niggas for scrilla 
I'm my own nigga, gorrilla Chest beater our leader
messiah wiser Elijah Muhammad, I garnish you DEAD!
Crucified, you can die, lose you lives, get euthanized 
Brutalize groups on sly, and recruit all size, DO OR DIE!
Survive it all, strivin', we'll crack your spinal cord Final four 
Murder and burn your face at the pearly gates, Berni's waiting' 
Manslaughter a camcorder, now span all of us 
Vanglorious, slam warriors, hang coroners 
Your head corner broads raised by my Aunt Attica 
Man tortured us, only pain stood strong with us 
What's wrong with us, love rage when it's calling' us 
the fire that's in all of us, nigga sing along with us 
 
[Chorus]
We will rise we will ride 
We don't die we don't cry 
Only spread our wings and just fly 
While you just try, just cry, just die 
 
We will rise we will ride 
We don't die we don't cry 
Only spread our wings and just fly 
While you just try, just cry, just die 
 
[Verse 2]
I'm the greatest, I'm gigantic Haters, they die frantic 
Makin' they life tattered, thigh shattered, spine cracked 
Dig graves on nine planets, fill it with nine rappers 
killing these one-status guys blackin', try laughing' 
I damage you fools, imagine I massacre avenues 
I'm cannibal spinal-tapping' your spectacular attitudes 
I'm slapping' you lateral Savages, animals let 'em loose 
Crashing' you backwards and rapidly catching' you Debt'n you 
Now stop playing' with me, slay 'em quickly, prey for strictly 
this drift to be bonecrushin', nigga say it with me
WE WILL [We will] WE WILL [We will] WE WILL [We will] WE WILL-WHAT?
Never die, terrorize, forever fly 
Spread your wings, the ghetto sings, we multiply 
Celebrate in every state, we watch 'em die 
Hollering' RISE! Hollering' RISE!
 
[Chorus]
We will rise we will ride 
We don't die we don't cry 
Only spread our wings and just fly 
While you just try, just cry, just die 
 
We will rise we will ride 
We don't die we don't cry 
Only spread our wings and just fly 
While you just try, just cry, just die 
 
[Bridge]
[X 2
Rock on, rock on, rock on, rock on 
Rock on, rock on, rock on, rock on 
Rock on Rock on 
Rock on, rock on, rock on, rock on]
 
To all my Sword &amp; Shield warriors around the world 
East coast, west coast, and dirty south it's on again 
We going' let these motherfuckers know that there will be no mercy 
Not today Not today Not today Not today HA!
 
[Chorus] x4
We will rise we will ride 
We don't die we don't cry 
Only spread our wings and just fly 
While you just try, just cry, just die </pre>
