Song:   Let it Rain
Typed by: Stus49@mail.ru

[Chorus]
Let it rain, let it rain, make the pain go away
In my brain, let it rain, let it rain
All this pain in my brain, oh, it drives me a insane
In God's name all this pain it's a shame

[Verse 1]
Wake up in the morning I got sleep in my eyes
I feel bad
Nobody gives a damn about a black brother
There's no other like my mother
We speak everyday not in sense of words but pray
Check it, ten years ago died of brain cancer
And went to heaven
1997 rollin' with the family Booya music
My peeps y'all representing
Runnin' everyday from the pain let it go away
It's drivin' me insane not to my dying day
High from the sky rain wash away my pain
And maintain
I can use my brain to play the game
It's a shame; try to figure out who I blame
When a child is born mom and daddy need a change
Like a window needs a frame and the sugar to the cane
Like a baby has a name

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
2:35 in the night, can't sleep, see me struggling
Sheets in my bed full of sweat, got to keep hustling
One and one is two and not three
The pain will release 'cause in God I believe
Yes, the only way in life to succeed is be blessed
Free your mind from head to toe and get dressed
Fresh express what you have in your chest unless
You want to put me to the test
Chicken breast, to be or not to be
Is the big quest', Federal Republic of Germany
Of course the West
Now you think that you know where we're coming from
Wipe away your tears little sister pray to God
One day rain will come by your way
Don't ever lose hope, nature gives and takes
No fuss, ashes to ashes and dust to dust

[Chorus] (2X)</pre>
