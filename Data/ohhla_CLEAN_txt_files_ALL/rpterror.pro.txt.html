"I got a lotta good shit to tell you all this evening"
"Come on give it up"

[Life]
It's the title of my life or should I say Life is my title
Me and the Disciples should be classified as idols
When we speak upon it's up
We don't jerk or play, it's vital
We get to the point, right to the end of the recital

"X discuss this"

[Patrick X]
Controversy, the path of many men
X to begin the level of introduction
Comin' live and direct from Asiatic descent
Take it seriously with my intent
Being a lyrical approach like a coach
Now you know the timin' while I do this rhymin'

"Jay" ---&gt; Run-D.M.C.

[JXL]
J-X-L, the third disciple
I'm on a rampage on stage, and I explode like nitro
Gettin' you all what you been hopin' and lookin' for
The Last Asiatic Disciple
Is like an outlaw

[B-Wyze]
B-Wyze into initial out the show to let you know
That I am Asiatic, the Last Disciples
You only slack the rightful
I talk it is the whole record market
Find yourself a seat
Take your butt down and park it

"Griff"

[Professor Griff]
I am the professor, professional rap
Specialist of terrorizing M.C.'s
As if I was a terrorist
"Yo, Griff" ---&gt; Flavor Flav
A-G-S, the Asiatic ghetto soldiers
Stand in command
Respect *shots fired* I told ya
Don't be alarmed as you breathe your last breath
As you flip the wax from side Life to Death
"Yo, Griff" ---&gt; Flavor Flav
"Get the green, black and red in" ---&gt; Chuck D
L-A-D, the Asiatic Disciples
Assigned to oppose on stage and get you frightened
Never let go the black chains we insist
A-G-S to L-A-D, rap terrorists</pre>
