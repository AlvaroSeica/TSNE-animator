Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Ooh la la la
Yeah we jumping on clouds
And we dance in the rain
Ooh la la la
When my world is on fire
I dance with the flames
Ooh la la la la la la la la la la la
Here's to everything
Here's to everything

Here we go like satellites
Chasing stars till we are blind
Still we go, we ignite
Put your hand inna the sky
Put your hand inna the air
Ooh la la la la la la la la la la la
Put your hand inna the air
Here's to everything
Here's to everything

Cloud 9, cloud 9
We shining like fireflies, fireflies
On a rise, on a rise
We moving at the speed of light
Speed of light
De de de de dum, de de de dum dum
If you wanna come, you better run, run
On a rise, on a rise
We moving at the speed of light
Speed of light

Here we go like satellites
Chasing stars till we are blind
Still we go, we ignite
Put your hand inna the sky
Put your hand inna the air
Ooh la la la la la la la la la la la
Put your hand inna the air
Here's to everything
Here's to everything

Ooh la la la
Yeah we jumpin' on clouds
And we dance in the rain
Ooh la la la
When my world is on fire
I dance with the flames
Ooh la la la, la, la, la, la la la la la
Here's to everything, here's to everything

Here we go like satellites
Chasing stars till we are blind
Still we go, we ignite
Put your hand inna the sky
Put your hand inna the air
Ooh la la la la la la la la la la la
Put your hand inna the air
Here's to everything
Here's to everything

Here we go like satellites
Chasing stars till we are blind
Still we go, we ignite
Put your hand inna the sky
Put your hand inna the air
Ooh la la la la la la la la la la la
Put your hand inna the air
Here's to everything
Here's to everything</pre>
