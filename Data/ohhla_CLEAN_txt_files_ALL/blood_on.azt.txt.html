The blood on your hands! The blood on your hands!
The blood on your hands stains the glory for which you

[Stand] 2x

Sit back and listen to this devious tale
I'm talkin about the country from which you all hail
Built on the bodies of Indians and slaves
A story of destiny and the land that it craves
It happen to be genocide in the 1st degree
But now it's called American pride the land of the free
So when you wave your flag and tell me love it or leave it
You think of the price tag, revolution will see it
Comin around the corner and it can't be stopped
It's the big bad Mexican with the glock cocked
They slaughtered woman and children and at wounded knee
No conscience about Hiroshima or Nagasaki
The blood on your hands! The blood on your hands!
The blood on your hands stains the glory for which you

[Stand!!!!] 2x

We live large in the United States
So you wonder why we want to smash the state
Well the answer is in the Zapatista wind
It lies in the facts that we're about to begin
We got hot running water and food on the plate
Which makes it difficult for you to feel irate
Ya live comfy, yeah that's how your livin!
Cuz survival to you, its just a given
While 3Z4's of the world are trying to stay alive
A country of color can barely survive
No hot running water or food on their plates
Marginal existence is their constant state
But its not because they can't, ya see they're not allowed
They get beat down by the US Mafia crowd
The CIA-FBI-IMF-crew
The world class multinational wrecking crew
So in the first world, you live like you do
Because the so-called third worlds are supporting you
Ya ask what is the motive? And what is the reason?
Well to the fat man powers always in season
Control means money and money means power
But to the real revolutionary we're waiting on the hour
To annihilate the rich, spread back to the poor
Terminate the pigs till it exists no more!!!!
Terminate the pigs till it exists no more!!!!
The blood on your hands! The blood on your hands!
The blood on your hands stains the glory for which you
