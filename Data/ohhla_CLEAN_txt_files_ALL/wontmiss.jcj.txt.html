(Intro)
Yooo
Still high
Still like FUCK you niggas, bitch (Pussy!)

(Verse 1, Juicy J)
I don't play with guns, but we call 'em toys
Totin' big straps that make a lotta noise
Talkin big money; Niggas better know it
Gun never on safety; I'm paranoid (Ho!)
I don't pull it out unless I'm bout to shoot (No sir)
I got military guns; I got goons too (We got it!)
Try to find me? (We got it!)
Wear yo black suit (Yo suit!)
You think you gon catch me slippin? You a damn fool (Let's go!)
My bitches strapped; They keep it in they purse (Them ho's!)
Try to ride up on me? Now you ridin in a hearse
That trippy shit; I'm on another planet (Mars, nigga)
Niggas hatin on me; I pull up wit' the Phantom
Ridin with the black car (Bitch)
Ridin with the black bag (Ho)
Black gloves, black hood, and ridin with the black mask (Ho)
I know niggas scared, so don't try to flex (Don't flex)
A couple of bullets hit his body, tore up his chest
*Loud gunshot*

(Hook, Juicy J)
A hundred rounds; I won't miss ya ass
Put ya ass on the shirt; Sayin they miss ya ass
Yo family miss ya
Yo girl miss ya
The niggas miss ya
Juicy J, I won't miss ya (Gunshots)
I won't miss ya (Gunshots)
I won't miss ya (Gunshots)
I won't miss ya 
Juicy J, I won't miss ya (Gunshots)
I won't miss ya (Gunshots)
I won't miss ya (Gunshots)
I won't miss ya
Juicy J, I won't miss ya (Gunshots)</pre>
