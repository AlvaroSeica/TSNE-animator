[Intro Skit]
Alarm clock! I hate alarm clocks, man. Hey babe, I gotta get up
I'm gonna wake him up and take him to school
I'ma have that talk with him, I'ma have that talk with him
A'ight, yeah. Hey!

Real shit, y'all!

[Verse 1]
I only got enough money for some hamburger meat
But I still ain't trippin', that's the shit I like to eat
But my son, he like, "Daddy, this is all we got to eat?"
I'm like, son, I'm 'bout to sign bigtime, I'm downloadin' beats
And I'm 'bout to start writin' to 'em, and if the fans don't buy 'em
I'ma kill them in they sleep, bring the extra cheese
We gon' eat somehow, like Vietnamese
Chinese, Japanese, gettin' dirty knees (Fuck!)
Make me go fuckin' smack a G with the AR, automatic Uzi machine 
All you gotta do is wash it off and then put it in the freeze
Then we good for another couple of weeks
When you get older like me, you'll be tuckin' the heat
And if not, you, you'll be stuck in the street
I wanna say your mom love you, but that's up to she
But we gon' do what we gotta do and that's get the meat
Strange Music got my back fade, hopefully
But if not, see, there really ain't no hope for me
That means you're goin' through the same situation
That means we gon' keep goin' through the same shit you hatin'

[Chorus]
(Meat!) We gotta find somethin' to eat
Even if we gotta go do it on the street
Even if we gotta go shootin' with the heat
Even if we lie to dude, we gon' get the meat

[Verse 2]
I only got enough money for Top Ramen noodles
My son lookin' at me like he don't wanna come too close
He saw me in the bathroom cryin', it was too late
I couldn't even keep a straight face, like a two-face
All them motherfuckers around me, they was too fake
I ain't got a album out, now they call me too late
Barbecue yesterday, where the fuck was I at? (Where?)
A football game? Where's my motherfuckin' high at?
I remember Lismore Drive, even after that
Starin' at my Strange chain, thinkin' I ain't goin' back
I got a new life, I'ma get a new wife
I'ma get a new nine, I think it was due time
No matter who's wrong or who's right, life is like
Shakin' 'em up and rollin' two dice, thin slice
And my old-school homie like, "Where you been, Ice?"
Just marinatin', stomach achin', shit ain't been right

[Chorus]

[Skit]
Hey Kev, wake up! (Fadin' off)
(Meat!) Hey Kev, wake up!

[Verse 3]
Little Kevin, wake up, it's school time, get your clothes on
Don't nobody love you like me, we in the ozone
Twilight zone, all we got to eat today is bullshit
Time for you to pray, but I don't pray, I carry full clips
You can't be like me 'cause I'm a fuck-up
And if we both fuckin' up, you gon' be just like me
It's gon' be a tight squeeze, we can get through this
You my little nigga, so nigga, we gon' do this
Shit, I can count it on one hand
Old as I am, I can still count it on one hand
We both Kevin Mann, we both gotta stretch it out
Like a rubber band, I got another plan
I got a million of 'em, I'ma still come with 'em
I'ma still run with 'em, we gotta keep it goin'
And then I'm done with it, that's it, I'ma wipe my hands
I'm hella broke, but I don't dance

[Chorus]

[Skit]
A'ight, son. What time you get out of school?
What, 2:30? A'ight, you meet me down the street, where we usually meet at
I'm-I'm gon' get some money
You just get your fuckin' ass in the fuckin' class, man
A'ight, I love you</pre>
