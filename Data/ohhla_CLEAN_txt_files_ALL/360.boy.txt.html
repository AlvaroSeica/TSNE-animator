Smook [x3] Soulja Boy Tell 'Em, SODMGdotcom
White lam' that's, swag
Pull up to the club, I pop tags
Lil' Dre or Lil Smook?
360 bands, panoramic roof
I'm the truth, the boy swag hard
Black car white tint, oh my Lord
V.I.P status, all night partying
When I hit the club, Ima shut this shit down man
This right here a rich nigga talkin
See my in the club. there's a rich nigga walkin
A badass yellow bone, and she on my side
And when I leave the club, she gon hop up in my ride
That right there, is fuckin SWAG
Hop up in that 2012 black jag
Lil Dre' or Lil Smook?
360 bands with the panoramic roof

360 bands, with the 360 bands
With the 360 bands, with the panoramic roof [x2]

See me in the club, that's a rich nigga talkin
See me in the streets, that's a rich nigga walkin
When I'm in my hood, that's a rich nigga trappin
When I'm on the mic, that's a rich nigga rappin
See me in the streets, all them trap niggas dappin me
See me with the club, yellow bones its catastrophe
Oh my God, Soulja Boy you goin ham
I pull up to the trap, that's some rich nigga goons
Rich nigga rims, yeah them bitches 24
Iced out brightlin got me stuntin on you hoes
That right there is poppin my tags
Step off in the club and I make it rain dollaz
Make it make it rain cause I came with the swag
Drop top benteley with the 360 tag
Poppin in the club, white team status
Ballin all night, Ima shut this shit down man
Young lil dre' or young lil smook?
360 bands with the panoramic roof [x3]

360 bands, with the 360 bands
With the 360 bands, with the panoramic roof [x2]

And I step inside the club
That right there is a rich nigga hug
And she wants me to bust off on her back
Took her to the crib and let the pussy drip
That right there is poppin my fuckin collar
Fall off in the mall and bought everything you had
Oh my Lord, Soulja be be goin ham
Pull up to the hood in a rich nigga door
Rich nigga rims, its them 24
Going so hard, see them rich nigga clothes
Black and white diamonds, oh my God I'm shining
That right there is how to be stomp
That right there is how you flex
Ice plus ice plus, neck
Lil Dre' do his thang
Twitter at SouljaBoy I'm the fuckin man
I said 360 bands

With the 360 bands [x2]
360 [x2] Panoramic roof
I got ya DJ Holiday..</pre>
