[Verse 1]
Uh, yo, yo
It was back in '07, did a couple of tapes
Did a couple of DVDs, made a couple of mistakes
Didn't know what I was doin but I put on the cap
Now its which world's whores should I go undertake
See you told me I'd lose but I won
I might cop a million Jimmy jewels just for fun
'Cause bitches couldn't take what was in me, Australia, Sydney
Might run up in Disney, out in L.A. with Lindsay
Got the eye of the tiger, the lion of Judah
Now it's me in my time, it's just me in my prime
Everythin I tried to teach 'em they gon' see it in time
Tell 'em bitches get a stick, I'm done leadin the blind
I got two shows tonight, that's Brooklyn and Dallas
Then the private party at the Buckingham Palace
Which means I gotta fly like a movie, no commercial
Its Young Money, Cash Money, yeah I'm Universal

[Chorus]
I hear they comin for me
Because the top is lonely
What the, they gon' say
What the, they gon' say
I'm the baddest bitch doin it, doin it
I'm the baddest bitch doin it, doin it
I'm the be-be-be-be
I'm the be-be-be-be
I'm the best

[Verse 2]
Uh-huh, yo, yo, yo, yo
I remember when I couldn't buy my mother a couch
Now am sittin at the close and bought my mother a house
You could never understand why I grind like I do
Makiah and  Jaloney, why I grind like I do
'Cause even when my daddy was on crack, I was crack
Now the whole album crack, you ain't gotta skip a track
I ain't gotta get a plaq', I ain't gotta get awards
I just walk up out the door, all the girls will applaud
All the girls will come in, as long as they understand
That am fightin for the girls that never thought they could win
But before they could begin, you told them it was the end
But I am here to reverse the curse that they live in
Got two bones to pick, I'ma only choose one
You might get a dress on the second album
Which means you can breathe 'til I motherfuckin say so
To all my bad bitches, I can see your halo

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Its okay, its okay
Long as you know, long as you know
Long as you motherfuckin know
I'm the be-be-be-be-be-be

[Chorus] + (Nicki Minaj ad-libs)</pre>
