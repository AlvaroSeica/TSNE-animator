Typed by: Lil Hustle

[Kai Hicks]
Gangsta, I'm on to you
What you gon' do, what you gon' do
Ooh gangsta ay, I'm on to you
What you gon' do baby, what you gon' do

[E.S.G.]
Three months on tour, now it's you that I'm missing
Reminiscing how you fitting, in your antique denim
Take off your true religion, now my tattoos she kissing
I'm fresh off the road, another million dollar mission
Nothing booshie bout my press, don't wanna ride on the yacht
That's my ghetto Cinderella, rather ride in my drop
Yeah underneath the stars, let her ride on top
Put the work in the rental car, make her ride with the blocks
Baby girl don't stop, till you reach the destination
Make the transaction, I'll be patiently waiting
Make sure the bread right, girl I hope the head right
Have my toes curling up, 'fore I hit the red light
Then I take the next flight, Feliz for the night
Swisha sweets ain't the only thang, you licking tonight
Now let's have a pillow fight, with bags of money
I'll slap you with the fifty's, and spank you with the hundreds huh

[Hook: Kai Hicks]
Gangsta, I'm on to you
The way you on your grind, I'm so glad you're mine
No other man can do me, quite the way you do
I'd like to take you home, so I can blow your mind

[E.S.G.]
I see your girls sit on my leather, they don't know what latitude
Bout my draws and Ed Harvey, just to show her gratitude
I ain't know she had a dude, the father of her baby
Now she blowing up my Nextel, text message crazy
Playing music from the 80's, O'Jays or Mays
Couple Queen's in the deck, but you my ace of spades
And play charades or role play, be the teacher of the list
I be the preacher or thief, taking more than your purse
We like Hov' and B, like Ashton and Demi
Now let's play Nascar, you can ride on my hemi
Now it's big G's and pimping, like I'm driving a semi
I keep pumping baby girl, till the gas tank's empty
Yeah she's independent, I still give a lil' change
Probably won't last, like Trina and Lil' Wayne
Ms. juicy ga-tor, Louis bag and stilettos
Once I hit it hard, she'll be screaming in falsetto uh

[Hook]

[E.S.G.]
Come here baby girl, let me talk to you
If Victoria's secret's true, then this song

[Kai Hicks]
I know you want me, I can feel your passion
Now come over here, and get some of this satisfaction

[E.S.G.]
I know you want me, I can feel the heat
Heard about my reputation in the street, it's so wrong

[Kai Hicks]
But tonight, it's just you and me
So put this record on repeat, I got what you need

[Hook - 2x]
