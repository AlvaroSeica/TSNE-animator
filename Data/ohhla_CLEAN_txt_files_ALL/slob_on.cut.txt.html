(Juicy J)
Slob on my knob
Like corn on the cob
Check in with me, and do your job
Lay on the bed, and give me head
Don't have to ask, don't have to beg
Juicy is my name, sex is my game
Let's call the boys, let's run a train
Squeeze on my nuts, lick on my butt
The natural curly hair, please don't touch
First find a mate, second find a place
Third find a bag, to hide the hoe face
Real name Rover, I said bend over
I started to knob, then came the odor
Smelled like mush, shouldn't had a woosh
Told her to stop, and take a douche
While she did that, I didn't want the cat
So I vamped out and never came back

Suck a nigga dick or something (4x)

My nigga D-Magic
Said they had to have it
I said just forget it, it's too craby
Know a little freak, in Hollywood
Sucks on dick, does it real good
She'll give you money, feel up your tummy
House full of kids, parents all schummy
Once had a down, backyard ground
Hit it from the back, enjoy the sound
Lay on the cover, always use the rubber
Till I got caught, fucking with her mother
She blamed it on me, we fought in the street
She pulled out a knife, so I had to flee
Called up the boys, went to her house
Trashed the whole place, threw the bitch out
Police busted in, where the niggas at?
We left just in time, and never came back
Roll through the hood, waving at the freaks
Who's sniffing all the rocks, and smoking all the geeks
Made another stop, police station
Saw a few cops, drove by and sprayed them
Licensee tag number, a nigga said he saw
Bogus all the time, never get caught</pre>
