[Wiz Khalifa]
Uh, it's the champagne pourin, big joint rollin
Bombay sippin, no blunt smokin
Bad bitch gettin, thick and she got some friends with her
I take 'em out, pourin shots of liquor
Drinkin out the bottle, smilin in all my pictures
The marijuana loud so them hoes +follow+ like Twitter
Nigga, you know everything Taylor
Don't rush to the bar fool, if you ain't got no paper
That's the rules, high as fuck, sloppy drunk when I'm passin thru
Rollin doobies up, ya hoe who we pass 'em to
Hit the club spend this money up, roll another one, drink, act a fool
That's what I have to do

[Chorus]
See after drinking champagne (champagne) all night
Never worry bout a damn thing (damn thing), when y'all might
Homie I'm on my level (yea), I'm on my level (yeah)
I'm on my level (yea), I'm on my level (yeaah)
So I'ma take one shot (one shot), to the brain
And I order three mo' shots (mo' shots), I'm goin in, ayy
I'm on my level (yea), I'm on my level (yeah)
I'm on my level (yea), I'm on my level (yeaah)

[Wiz Khalifa]
Spent a couple dollars on my engine, motor roarin 
when I back out the garage, gin got me drunk as fuck 
Stumblin out the bar, plus I'm strugglin tryna find the 
keys to my car, 'cause I be goin hard 
Roll the camera, life just like a movie, I'm the star
Wish you was in my position, you too broke to play the part
Of course~! I keep some bad women with me in the back
Sippin Rose with some hash twistin
All about a dollar, my team into cash gettin
Straight out the burb, where we drink and we smash niggaz
So when I say I'm ballin, that don't mean, that I'm playin mate
All my diamonds talkin, you can see, what they sayin mayne - Tahahahaha...

[Chorus]

[Too $hort]
In the middle of the night, early in the mornin
From the streets to the sheets with some freaks, I ain't yawnin
I'm wide awake, we ain't eatin and we ain't sleepin
These bitches so high man, we ain't even speakin
We just freakin, you rollin with, $hort Dog baby
She was high on that pill, so I fucked yo' lady
Come to my house I give 'em, EVERYthing they wantin
I might not do it, but I give to ya women
Cocaine, mushrooms, ecstasy, GHB, marijuana
She can suck it if she wanna
I got tequila, Ciroc and two freaky friends
and this a Wednesday night, this ain't the weekend~!!

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Mayne I'm high as fuck - mayne I swear I'm on my level
Mayne I'm sloppy drunk - mayne I swear I'm on my level
I'm finna pass out - mayne I swear I'm on my level
A nigga get smashed out - my nig', I swear I'm on my level
Umm, mayne I'm high as fuck - mayne I swear I'm on my level
Mayne I'm sloppy drunk - mayne I swear I'm on my level
Umm, I'm finna pass out - mayne I swear I'm on my level
A hater get smashed out - my nig', I swear I'm on my level
