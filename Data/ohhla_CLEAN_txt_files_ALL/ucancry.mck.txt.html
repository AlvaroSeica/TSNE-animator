Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Yeah, yup I heard it
Chef, man what up

Ay yo, money like flow and swaging like Ruff
Fuck with them big girls, get head
Get space I go on I knew
I had to move on this light red boned bitch
Grew on me I know you rich a few
Kids live in the cliffs
All I see is log in hour
That's what it is
Clean brand Lewis was then
At the crib I'm at arrest cooking
Came to negligee stop looking rap from the stove
Yo came over slam in this rock
She threw it then I'm out for looking out
Chill boy set my real boy real smooth
That's why I buy more shit and feel it in sense
This my nigga long time gangster
I got the real lone

You can cry to me
You're the only I let see inside of me
So give me a hug
This is my promise for ya
Ask where I'll be when I'm older
And I'll be your man
If you'll be my woman oh
You'll understand
Because we older, oh yeah

You can cry to me
When we're making love
You can cry to me girl if it's too much

You don't have to hide form me
I know it's frightening
It's Tuesday but it still feels like night to me
Just gimme a hug baby I've had it for ya
Ask what you see when it's over
You'll see a man
I see my woman
You'll understand
It could be your babe oh

You can cry to me
When we're making love
You can cry to me girl if it's too much
Oh oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
You can cry to me
When we're making love
You can cry to me girl if it's too much
Oh oh</pre>
