I live at home still
Not paying phone bills
Hydro or rent
And my mom makes most meals
So its so ill
I don't need no scrill
Only cash for gas
When I borrow my folks' wheels
(but you can't drive)
Whatever our van died
(get a good bike)
Who I look like, that lance guy?
I ain't pushin no banana seat
Lookin like some 8-year old kid on your grandma's street
You can go ahead and call me lazy
I just retired real young yall, call me jay-z
Or maybe I just hate these crappy jobs
Call my crazy, but I refuse to work em man
Its miserable
Cant do it 'less its due to circumstance
And I need the cash to feed my astronomical appetite
But for the time being yall, I'll sacrifice
And have a life minus a couple of luxuries
Just cutting by budget schemes
And getting some stuff for free
Like whys a brother need a dentist?
Its expensive and my gums'll bleed
They do everytime when he scrubs em clean
And every year they try to bump the fee
Plus he'll prolly recommend braces - there you go
That's another G!
Well thanks a lot doc but listen
I can brush my teeth all on my own
So you ain't gon hustle me!
so that takes care of the dental plan
now heres a potential scam
getting my toes crushed by a rental van
then if I
sued the driver and the rental guys
enterprise or whatever
I bet they would settled niiice
Court adjourned, now I just gotta pay
For the law forms
That's easy - spend 2 weeks eatin popcorn
Like students 'cept I'm grown and its not dorms
So it's a bit more pathetic - ok a lot more...
But what yall gotta mock for (mach 4)?
Whats wrong with my mach 3?
Yall gotta be macho and mach more
Well not me and I do not need to change blades
Its all my own hair I shave
Chin back face legs
And the rashes rarely last more than 8 days
Usually so its cool with me - I can save great
And hygene ain't no reason to buy things
Like soap or visine or getting clothes dry cleaned
I don't throw away dough on no facials
Yeah I make rolls of my pennies
I even pay folks
In clubs out this case full of pesos I lug
Get em exchanged? Nope, I'm waiting til the rate's low
Don't hate yo
Just cuz yall wasteful
Yall wanna make your bruh the scapegoat
Its bugged...
Its all nuance
Use your head - why get a bed and couch
when you can slouch on a futon instead
if you got a little bread like croutons
download them new songs and spread them coupons

...

If you happy when you save 2 dollars a week
You steal your neighbors empty bottles
And keep all your receipts and only treat your girl
Yearly to McDonalds to eat
Don't be ashamed, pop your collars mang - holler at me!
If yall are this cheap
This is for acknowledging peeps
That gotta track every dime usin columns and sheets
If you strip search the mall for the bargain to beat
Like everyday youre just a penny safe from starved in the street
Keep carvin a niche
I'm started in a jar for the wee
Little shaddies still to come for their college degree
Yo I figure starting early on the market is key
I plan on havin smart daughters all Harvard md
And regardless we gon never put a car on the streets
'less them gas prices lower and the parking is free
And no parka for me
Not even gloves scarves or a fleece
I may freeze but I'll keep savin marvellously... holla!</pre>
