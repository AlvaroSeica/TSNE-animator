Down down down
Down down down
Down down down
Down down down

Aye girl how you livin tonight?
Can I get forgiven tonight?
Cause the way that it's lookin like I'm sinnin' tonight
Cause I'm lookin' and I see a lot of women tonight
You probably tryna blow me off
So go stunning on my swag so you know I'm boss-
In
You know a jocker gotta ball
But say how'd you get it back cause I never lost it
You know why jockers stay afloat
They love the music they don't know to really play it though
Is it just cause I'm a manner?
And I'm tickin' like a timer and all my ladies stylin and you're with me
I'm a clothes designer and I'm hotter than an iron
And the irony's entired and I'm winnin
And I'm winnin
Maybach, yea I'm in it
Girl why you trippin? Take a minute oh jeeez
Girl I'm kidding
Take you to my spot, I can show you how I'm livin
Get up in my car but only if you're with it
We'd be kissin' in the back cause my windows stay tinted
I just did it to em
No girl, I'm not timid
You can hit them on the car, don't got a limit
Even if you did, lil jocker did hit it
Cause you keep on going higher ever since I started spittin
Girl you sad, I get it
Girl you mad, what is it?
Something bad? I fix it
But all you want is swag
Well, I'm glad that you are ready
Cause these jockers trippin

So this is my town
Teo in the spot when the joker ain't around
Pat me on the head, just be careful of the crown
And my dad said that you still lost til you found
And you keep em going down

Sometimes life is hard, don't let love get you down
Don't do it girl, don't do it
You're so beautiful but baby, who knew it?

Sometimes life is hard, don't let love get you down
I admit it, I get these from you trippin
We either break-up or make up so forget it

Girl you walked up in the night club
Well, you walked up in the right club
And some dudes tryna get something
Well, it's bout to be a fight club
Cause I be lookin for a hottie with a body
Girl you ready? Thinkin it
Girl I got you drinkin'
And the next day pickin, wickin, sneakin
My room for the weekend
Tell that chef that you a vegan
Baby you ain't never leaving
Guess you want a cheek when you sleepin
Beacon of light
Baby girl, good night
I know that you on my side
But that's only for the night
Why it always gotta feel wrong when it's right?
And it's about to go down and you know it
Girl I really like it so just throw it down
Girl on the mop you ain't a poet
You gon be at home tryna hold it down
When you get mad girl I know it
That's when you take your phone and you throw it down
I'm looking at you now and you going
And I looks up in my eyes and you know it
And I hold it but it's bout to go down
It's about to go down
It's about to go down
It's about to go down
It's about to go down
It's about to go down
It's about to go down
It's about to go down down down...

So this is my town
Teo in the spot when the joker ain't around
Pat me on the head, just be careful of the crown
And my dad said that you still lost til you found
It's about to go down

Sometimes life is hard, don't let love get you down
Don't do it girl, don't do it
You're so beautiful but baby, who knew it?

Sometimes life is hard, don't let love get you down
I admit it, I get these from you trippin
We either break-up or make up so forget it

Sometimes life is hard, don't let love get you down
Don't do it baby, don't do it
You're so beautiful but girl, who knew it?

Sometimes life is hard, don't let love get you down
I admit it, I get these from you trippin
We either break-up or make up so forget it</pre>
