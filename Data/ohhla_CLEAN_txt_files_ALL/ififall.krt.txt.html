[Big K.R.I.T.]
Yeah, will you uh, uh, uh-uh, catch me if I fall?
Will you uh, uh, uh-uh, catch me if I fall?
Will you uh, uh, uh-uh, catch me if I fall?
Yeah, I gave my all

Cheah, aye I'm a man so I stand on my own two
I give a damn bout a hater and his whole crew
No jump shot, so I'm selling crack
To tell you the truth, I've been through Hell and back
No food in the kitchen, so I'm scraping scraps
Tightest nigga in the world can't afford to rap
Now I'm on the hunt for a nigga to jack
Soon as I get rich, that's where I'm giving it back
It's cold out here, you gotta hold your own
I never knew what pain was until I was grown
I never missed my homeboy until he was gone
But life goes on, so if I call

[Chorus: Melanie Fiona]
If I fall, by the river bed
Would you save me, or leave for dead?
All the blood I shed
Think I'll just rest my head

[Big K.R.I.T.]
Cheah, ain't nothing easy bout the life I chose
Wasn't much of a choice, just the life I know
Smoking weed, drinking liquor just to kill time
When I'm fucked up, the only time I feel fine
Mama say I'm letting life go by
As if I ain't grinding, as if I don't try
But you can see in her eyes, she worry bout her baby
Late night, scared a nigga might play me
Police in the street, don't phase me
Get it how you live, let 'em chase me
Bills still due, yeah I can't stall
And that ain't all, so if I call

[Chorus]

[Big K.R.I.T.]
Cheah, I used to love her, I used to hold her
She made me promise I'd never let her go
She made me smile, could have had my child
I held her tight like I've never held before
But things change when you get older
She started drinking cause I ain't sober
That's when I told her, be careful bout the friends you keep
cause the ones you call friends ain't friends to me
Now we don't see eye to eye
The more I tell her the truth, the more she lies
The more we shoot each other down, the more we die
I think it's best that I say goodbye, so when I call

[Chorus]</pre>
