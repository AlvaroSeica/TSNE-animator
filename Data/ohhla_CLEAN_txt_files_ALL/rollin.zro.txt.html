[Z-Ro]
Coming up as a youngster, watching the O.G.'s in my hood flossing in they rides
Candy paint chrome wheels, and black magic on their tires
Me yeah I was loving it, but not old enough to drive
Parking lot pimping, from the passenger side
I use to walk everywhere, I had to show up
Shoe heels worn down like wheel rubber, man I was about to go nuts
Hopefully I would blow up, in this rap game mayn
My people rolled swangas, I wanna be rolling the same thang
Never had all of the work, but I was doing what I could
Moving nickels dimes twenties, and ounces all through my hood
Since I had that A-1 yola, fiends cash me up
Meanwhile thumbing for a ride, my homies pass me up
It's all gravy, when I'm able I'ma show em all something
From a hooptie to a foreign, I'm balling it's all or nothing
Treat my feet with designer keats, and sleep in the finest home
Only place you'll catch me walking is to my mailbox, in the streets I'll be on chrome

[Chorus]
I'll keep, rolling chrome
I'll keep, rolling chrome
Wood grain, is what I'm holding on
I'll keep, rolling chrome

[Z-Ro]
I started out with a canary yellow Cutlass Supreme, on bald tires
Yeah I know I was out of line, but that was all I could find
Or should I say that was all I could purchase, for what I had to spend
But at least I had something, to go from point A to B in
No more offering gas money, to get a lift
Besides when you driving, it's easier to get a chick
So ain't no mo' parking lot pimping at the club, I'm up in there
Seeking lil' mama with thick thighs, I hope she let me in there
Like swimwear, pull up to the motel and we'll go in there
Nothing left to do, but commit a sin there
And that was in my hooptie, but when I showed up big body with the gloss
All of the boppers was bopping, I just couldn't shake em off
16 switches 22 inches, trunk going to war
They don't wanna lay up with me, they wanna lay up with my car
I was loving it back then, and still love it today
Except I'm not yellow Cutlass no more, I'm 300 blue over grey on chrome

[Chorus]

[Z-Ro]
Finally I'm in the mix, riding 24's or 26
My neck and my wrist lit, without me selling a brick
TV's in the roof and the dashboard, and I'm watching a flick
Rolling with my pistol in my lap, and I'm cocking it if
I spot something suspicious in my rearview mirror, when I'm creeping
If you plan on jacking me, I'm planning on leaving you sleeping
I be in different vehicles, cause I'm having thangs
And King of Da Ghetto Entertainment, has got me having change
You can smell it on me
Even though I'm quiet, the way I live it be telling on me
Don't get it twisted, I'm still a felon homie
Thinking you gon' rob me, that's an N-O
And when I'm in the N.O., I roll with Gotto Cuzzo and Mr. Marcelo
And they be with me when they be in Texas, the Butt Naked is the spot
Fonix, Harlem Nights and Scores where they drop it like it's hot
So if you trying to call me, and I don't answer my phone
I can't hear it cause my music's too loud, I'm banging on chrome

[Chorus]

S.U.C., baby S.U.C.
Baby, S.U.C.</pre>
