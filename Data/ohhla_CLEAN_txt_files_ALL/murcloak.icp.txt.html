Going trick or treating in my murder cloak
Going trick or treating in my murder cloak
Halloween

[Shaggy 2 dope]
I woke up and don't remember falling asleep
I feel the same wicked hungers calling from deep
They tell me to hunt devils in they robes and slippers
Take some bolt clippers, a black cloak, and scissors
Now I'm standing in the backyard, final regret
Steady sweating, once I do this ain't no forgetting
Enter through the back door everybody's asleep
I see they tidy and neat, I'm bout to bloody the sheets
Its gonna be a blood splatter expert feel day
Because I'm killing today to take this feeling away
They told me you people are here to ruin our cause
And mine's screwing your jaws, you're gonna have to repaint the walls
And its a hunger and I'm hungry like I'm homeless and its Thanksgiving
Thank you for the sacrafice Your life is what you're giving
No forgiving me, you hate the homicidal insane
You hating nothing with these scissors in your brain
Now watch your eyes bleed

Its the sickness slide
Can't stop myself
I need some help
And when nobody left I'm killing myself
Its the sickness slide
Can't stop myself
I need some help
And when nobody left I'm killing myself

[Violent J]
Sometimes I wear my murder cloak and tune into the news
I like to watch they speculation cause they always assume
They got a shoeprint, big deal when I been burned the pair
When them fucking stupid piggies gonna learn out there?
I tied a bitch up, I had to duct tape the bitch face
I threw in the trunk, got home and found a suffercated waste
I had to cut the bitch up, just went to shut the bitch up
I never fucked that ho, they said I did, man, she was a slut
I'm sick and tired of they lies thus everybody dies
Break into some homes I take a spoon and bloody eyes
I'm nutty guys. But you can't see the darkness I do
Maybe I'm heartless, Its true, But every part is cause you
My daddy beat me with a seven iron and then brought home a hooker
My daddy beat her with a shovel threw her in the cooker
Next day, I hate to say it but you know what happened next
He served my plate and in the meat I found a Kotex
Oh my God.

Its the sickness slide
Can't stop myself
I need some help
And when nobody left I'm killing myself
Its the sickness slide
Can't stop myself
I need some help
And when nobody left I'm killing myself

Halloween
A time to don a murder cloak and murder folks
Join us as we freefall backwards into the depths

[Anybody Killa]
My murder cloak drags down way past the ground
And it makes me want to take the life of anyone around
So be aware of the killer dressed in all black on Halloween
Face of revenge coming back back for past things
Fires on the 30th, Murdering the 31st
Long heavy robe that I've had since birth
Looking like the next generation of Darth Vadar
Hatchet in my hand so I can swing at all the haters
Fuck it. Whoever's breathing, its time to take your last breath
Cause Hallowicked murdering massacre is all thats left
Try trick or treating on the streets in my neighborhood
We'll pack your whole family's stomach with goods
Putting fear in the eye of a blind man walking by
Cause he can see for the first time in his life
After thatHhalloween you better know
Murder Cloak, beware.

Life is so cold
Life is so mean
Just let me sleep until next Halloween
