- Say man, they been lookin for you for three months, man
- Man, I hear him
  Them hoes had me locked down in solitary, I couldn't holler at nobody
  Knowmsayin, it was fucked up
- Thanks to Bido, man, we ready to put our hands on you
  But check this out, the lawyer, the judge, the warden, everybody been taken care of, man
  So you be raisin out of this motherfucker immediately
  By the way, what the fuck's been goin on in here?

[ Big Mike ]
I went to court today, them motherfuckers re-set it
But I'm used to that shit now, so I ain't gon' sweat it
Damn court appointed lawyers, they don't do a damn thing
Railroadin a nigga, they got paid anyway
Take they funky-ass $200 and run
Leavin a nigga locked up in this bitch just for fun
(That's a damn shame) Hell yeah, they be fuckin up
Look how they certified that juvenile right there named Buck
Gave that motherfucker 50 years
His life won't be worth shit by time he get outta here
And look at that dopefiend goin nuts
Sweepin the flo' for fuckin cigarette butts
Speakin on cig' butts, it's time to play crook
I gotta steal mine cause I ain't got no money on my books
I had a pack, but traded 'em to the trustee
That's why I'm wearin this brand new Cadillac, G
Yeah, and sportin the bitch like a champ
I gotta get a hold of some envelopes and stamps
So I can write a couple of letters to my folks
To put some money on my books so I can get me some smokes
Cause ain't nobody sendin me a motherfuck
Hey yo, when you get through that cigarette, G, let me catch that butt

Yo man, I kick you down with that, but just remember
(Don't worry about a thing
Cause every little thing gonna be) --&gt; Bob Marley
(Alright, it's gonna be alright) --&gt; Zapp

[ Big Mike ]
You see that nigga right there, he's locked down for rape
And tonight his motherfuckin manhood they gon' take
He tried to tell us he was down here for robbery
We found out later that rapin was his hobby
Yeah, he raped a little baby girl, jack
I hope they fuck him in his ass until his tongue turn black
And I bet the bossman won't stop it
Just turn his head and walk away like he ain't see shit
Come to think of it, they need to fuck him too
I put a gun to his head without a care and just shoot
Goddamn man, why they takin so long with my shit?
I can't wait to get home, I'm ready to bail out this bitch
I called my girl, some motherfucker cursed me out
I told the bitch I'ma kill both of you hoes when I get out
Man, that shit made me so motherfuckin mad and uptight
I damn hear begged the bossman to let me out for one night
Cause I ain't the one to get played by a bitch
But hey, I caught a cause and now I can't do shit

Man, fuck that bitch, she wasn't shit anyway
Let a motherfuckin hoe be a hoe, and like I said befo'
(Don't worry about a thing
Cause every little thing gonna be) --&gt; Bob Marley
(Alright, it's gonna be alright) --&gt; Zapp

[ Big Mike ]
Hey yo man, you hear these fuckin lies they tell?
About how they used to raise so much damn hell?
You see that nigga right there, he's a motherfuckin trip
Always talkin that goddamn lip
Came up to me the other day, introduced himself this way
"Say my name is Billy Ray and boy, I got some shit to say
When I was bein in the world had so many fine-ass girls
Walkin around with big old asses draped in diamonds, golds and pearls
Nobody ever fucked with me cause I carried a nine, you see
They had to put me away cause I was killin niggas constantly
Back in the world I was a bad-ass brother"
I said, "Get out of my face, you lyin motherfucker"
Cause he be in the shower jackin off his dick
Shootin nut on his toes, the bastard must be sick
But I guess when you been locked up in this bitch for so long
It ain't no thing to introduce the palm of your hand to your bone
(Chow time!) I'm sick of eatin this goddamn slot
Taste like some shit that they just scraped from the bottom of the pot
I'll do anything for a homecooked meal
Visions of fried fish, this shit can't be real
(Mike, you're losin it, man) Well goddamn it, let me lose it
Imagination strong, so I know I gotta use it
I wanna go home, I wonder can I break out?
This Penitentiary Blues have got me down, no doubt

Man, don't let that shit get you down
Jay done took care of everybody and everything
So man, just
