Check, Check, Check
Check it out, hip hop iz, all about biz
They tell you, but know that its all for the kids
Or deep down, it's all for the folks you miss
So you thinkin about it next time you poppin' a thizz
Criticize me for the way that I live, give a fuck
Cuz you turned to burn the bridge
You gave birth to a prince ever since you left me
Alone in the game on my own to MC
I'm runnin em' down, its something like a hunted child
A hundred thou to flip, if you underground
It gets deeper, the reefer rolled, control mics
But hey, the speakers blown
I gotta go, no time to play me
Gimme the blunt I hit hard like safetys
Face defeat, to me man I'm in the place to be
Do it live while Nick Peace remake the beat, like

(Chorus) (scratched)
Hip hop
This is hip hop (hip hop)
This is hip hop (hip hop)
Hip hop is now in performance
Hip hop (this is hip hop)
Hip hop is now in performance

(Equipto)
Check, hip hop iz a gigantic market
Control your fan base and know who to target
Doin it worldwide but I ain't no star yet
I'm in the record store still tryin to bargain
Played the game starving, but pay my rhyme (pay my rhyme)
Buy the CD's I don't fuck with consignment
To all of you rap cats that's tryin to get major
Get ya paper pray, for a savior
Keep networkin, and contact your lawyer
Live your life like a warrior
Go back down man, you still got a question to answer
It's the industry and everythings gangsta
The gun smoking, they cutthroatin
They gone, choke bud and get no promotion
It's cold, catch emotion like hoes on periods
Experience the game and you take it serious
This is hip hop

(Chorus) (Scratched)

(Equipto)
Hip hop iz, multiple tricks
Pay a grip jus to get they ass all in the mix
Get frisked at the door, when we takin a risk
Shoot a swish, insist that I eat some Peruvian fish
Which is my favorite dish
And without no drama I blow the swish
Boy I ball up my fists and I feel the 'drenaline
I, never forget like a elephant
Still will drop the raw elements
Reppin' the west coast
Hit the club, fake love, fuck a dress code
Ignore the groupie hoes, cut the movie roles
That wasn't me I was probably in the studio
Somethin like a scientist, watch me strategize
My +midnight machine gun rhymes and alibis+
Treat it like nothing and continue to diss
But I be doin what I really feel hip hop iz
That's this

(Chorus) (Scratched)

Stanky ass rappers make me sick!</pre>
