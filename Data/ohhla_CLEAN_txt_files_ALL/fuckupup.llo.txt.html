Typed by: Cno Evil

[Chorus: Lounge Lo]
You steal my money, I'll fuck you up up
You smokin' my piff, I'll fuck you up up
You talk to the cops, I'll fuck you up up
Fuck you up up, fuck you up up
You not from my hood, I'll fuck you up up
You lookin' like you schemin', I'll fuck you up up
You think you the shit, I'll fuck you up up
Fuck you up up, fuck you up up

[Lounge Lo]
Pushing hard on the block, where them bloods be banging out
And niggas on the corner, smoking piff, they hanging out
Parole coming through, cuz they heard, you was staying out
With niggas who get money, and like to lay in the route
Niggas still talking, man, shut ya miggy mouth
The shit that I got'll go farther than diggy south
And I don't give a damn, ya'll know what B.B. bout
My name on the radio, scooping the city shouts
The fiends still love me, boy, I got cliggy clout
Plus keep a couple bricks, just for the driggy drought
You know my hood, man, niggas is bad cats
And bad cats is bugged out, when dressing in all black
The guns going off like pap-pap-pap-pap
And youngings in the hood, slinging crack-crack-crack-crack
And I don't give a fuck, where the fuck you at-at
It's Beez Mode, ease flow, the Island of Stat', Stat'

[Chorus]

[Lounge Lo]
Ain't nothing changed, from the block, where them niggas, they pop they guns
Work out and sling work, bented the block for ones
My shit pop rocks, and your shit, pop dumbs
Come on, little holmes, I know Stones that send them hot ones
You get it, you got, I've been in the project
If it's gwop in the crib, then I will pee in ya closet
Where them ratchets so big, you asking where did I cop it
Shut ya blood clot mouth, boy, and give me ya pockets
You know the kid like to move and rocket, on this joint
Right here, my nigga, my nigga, my nigga, the topic
But the kid seeing niggas is flopping, I'm that new dude
So don't ask when Drop City is dropping
Niggas crazy like an old lady out there hopping
Just like young boys with 3-80's, out there popping
The same shit, happened in hoods, that's not too good
You thought twice, and really wanna take it back if you could, you could

[Chorus]

[Outro: Lounge Lo]
I'll fuck you up up, Beez Mode with an ease flow, man
I see ya'll niggas out there, pushing ya hard
Pushing ya'll whips, but you know
I justa justa linger, man, ya'll know what I do, man
Ain't nothing changed, man...
I'mma get it from the ground up, let's go, my dudes
You still my money... Crimson Stone, Lingering Stone, and I've been home, bitch</pre>
