Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Pharrell]
Let's be rebellious baby
No turnin back now
I'm already sold on it
You came and convinced me
I wanna get this over with
Thank God the teenagers takin over the world
And all your old school niggaz, should just go fishin for pearls

[Chorus]
I came to sweat {*3X*}
Well get on up and jam y'all
I came to jam tonight
And I came to party
Well I come to jam tonight
Life makes me horny

[Pharrell]
They talk about yesterday
But I'm just thinkin 'bout tonight
Don't take it no kind of way
But I just wanna dance all night
Thank God the teenagers takin over the world
And all you yesterday people, should stay in your bed and curl

[Chorus]

[N*E*R*D]
Uhh, damn right
I am a ten-to-five
I am a happy dryer
Your uphill makes my mouth dry
C'mon let's wash saliva
Don't you wanna feel some love
Everybody is high on drugs
Got problems with some nookie
I am the nookie piper~!

[Pharrell]
Thank God the teenagers takin over the world
And when you open up your eyes, I hope you old fucks just hurl
Look here
I came to sweat {*3X*}
You ain't seen nothin yet

[Chorus]</pre>
