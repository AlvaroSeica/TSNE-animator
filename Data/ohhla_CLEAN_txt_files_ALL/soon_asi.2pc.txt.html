[2Pac]
As soon as I get home
Soon as as I get home

Dear baby, it's me again
Stuck inside this max pen
Tryin' to pay me debt, for all my sins
See, these penatentary times be so heavy on my mind
At times it's like I'm livin' just to die
I'm livin' in hell, stuck in my jail cell
Stranded in the county jail
Waitin' for my chance to post bail
I wanna be paid in large stacks, and mash in FAST JAGS
I blast and wonder how long will I last
My memories fade when I'm intoxicated, busters are shady
So I'm dumpin' on cowards crazy when ever faded
I know I said it all before, but now I mean it
Visions of me and you ballin', so crystal clear I seen it
Even tho you mad at me
You'll be glad to see the strategy of makin' these chicks cum so easily
I max out in the morning, baby life is good
Me and you against the whole hood
Soon as I come home...

[Chorus]
Grab my straps, locate my comrades
Let's get my enemies not knowin I'm comin back
Go get the money out the safe
It's time to turn the streets into a war zone
Soon as I get home

[2Pac]
Sittin' here lookin' at pictures of me and you livin
But now you out in the world, while I'm twistin in prison
Love letters come daily, words of affection, you send me money
And nude beggin' for some sexin
Stay wide open, keep yo eyes peeled
And my advice is keep it real or you can die squelin'
Plus I never had to worry 'bout a visit, cause your there daily
Guard tryin' to get ya number, you don't dare tell me
Tongue kissin', steady humpin'
Tryin to touch up something
Before the C-O in the corner jump in, frontin'
Late night reminiscencin' everybodys quiet
I think somethings in the air, prepare for the riot
It's padlocks in my socks, steel from the bed springs
I touch 'em with Thug Love
And then let they heads ring
Started a war, but now I'm gone
Release me to the streets in the morning, it's on
Soon as I get home

[Chorus]

[Kadafi]
So keep it goin'
My whole lifes been like a game of Cee-low
Thinkin' big like they keep to me no feelings, my dreams like Nino
Brown the whole town be shook up
And me and momma survived the pick up
How many rocks I made to cook up
Narcotics got traffic, seen those niggaz you blasted
Wantin' me in a casket, on a ground, kind of plastic
Yeah nigga I heard you, Lil' Moe gave the words
You get paroled on the 3rd, you sold love, we out here frontin'
Still here but all about nothing, but double O's is
What I'm wantin', and I'm tryin' to say something, that we ain't never had
Luxuery life, results livin' bad, tricks of the trade
Shit that should've been taught by dad
But learn, do the crew, lessons between me and you
And once we lock this shit down it ain't a thing they can do
Meanwhile I stay waitin' by the phone
Hopin' I'll get a call tellin' a nigga that you home

[Chorus] - 6x to the fade</pre>
