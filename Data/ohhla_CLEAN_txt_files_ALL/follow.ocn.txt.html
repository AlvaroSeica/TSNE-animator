[Frank Ocean]
I looked you in the eyes
I crossed my heart and hope to die, I will never let them cry
I held you in my arms
Said I wont let go until you feel you're ready ('til you feel you're ready)
Told me on the phone
Somethin that you love me, well baby say it to my face
I can have a place in your world
Kinda like your Army, your Air Force, your Peace Corps

[Chorus]
So baby follow follow follow
Tell me where you want to go
Just keep your body, close and don't let go
Follow follow follow
Baby let me be the guide, just listen for the signs
And when I tell you right left switch it up
I'ma take it slow, I'ma take it slow (ohh)
Oh baby stop there, right there
Don't lose control, don't lose control (ohh)
Now baby look up at the stars
If you wanna go, promise we can go (ohh)
You just gotta follow follow follow {*2X*}

[Frank Ocean]
Ohh baby if you like~!
We can go to paradise, be back by the next sunrise
And no, I won't stay in Rome
I never go faster the limit (not unless you with it)
And you told me on the phone
Said you wanna love me, well baby tell me how it feels
Gotta have place in your world
Something like no other, your lover, your best friend, ooh

[Chorus]

[Frank Ocean]
Left, right, switch it up
Oh we gotta pick it up now (slow it down down)
Hell yeah! Switch it up
No we just can't let it fall down (gotta keep it that, that, that, that)
Can't quite get enough
Gotta keep your back arched up
Follow the leader baby girl
It's goin down, down, down
(Down down down)

[Outro]
Now move it right left switch it up
I'ma take it slow, I'ma take it slow (ohh)
Oh baby stop there, right there
Don't lose control, don't lose control (ohh)
Now baby look up at the stars
If you wanna go, promise we can go (ohh)
You just gotta follow follow follow
You just gotta follow follow follow</pre>
