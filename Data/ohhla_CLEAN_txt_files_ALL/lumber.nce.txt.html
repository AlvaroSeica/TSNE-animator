"Ladies and gentlemen, here's the man! I mean the man!
The sensational, the incomprible, the dynamic *Daddy Rich*"

"You know, a judo, a chop chop chop"
"Swing swing swing, and chop chop chop" (Repeat 4x)

[Pete Nice]
Quick on the cut, to the cut I gotta go (go)
Lumberjack chopping up the beat just swinging low
Freaking all the funk cause my man's a funk freaker
Listen to the cuts jumping straight out your speaker
Skills on the hills so I guess he steals a crew
If you're on his dick, don't fret, I'm on his dick, too
Got a bag of tricks, but he ain't pulling rabbits
Rabbits is endowed with the sexual habits
Took a long time in his room spinning records
Shit's going on, pumps fatter than a heifer
Chop chop he go, chopping it up like Sam the Butcher
Next thing you know the record chop like a hooker
Hits on the table, yeah Rich with the quick hand
Now understand this, he ain't the ordinary rap man
Bring all the wizard in Brooklyn's chop shop
Listen to the Lumberjack record go chop

"You know, a judo, a chop chop chop"
"Swing swing swing, and chop chop chop" (Repeat 4x)

Tell me, toss another record on the platter
Have to see him swing it, swing it like a hook and ladder
Mister ??? if you went up with only liquor
Better keep your papes in your pocket or we vic ya
Busting off shots in the backyard of Brooklyn
Chopped by the hoes, only hoes that's good looking
He move crowds overseas, even immigrants
Seen him in his 300 Benz with the tints
Think you want to step to the Lumberjack?
That's what you think, but you must be blunting cracks
Could you place your ass in a DJ recepticle
But a Lumberjack will just chop off your testicles
You want to get with the master chopper?
Better get a kung-fu to the little grasshopper
Heard your cuts and your cuts is kinda sloppy
Better get your ticket, watch the Rich get choppy

"You know, a judo, a chop chop chop"
"Swing swing swing, and chop chop chop" (Repeat 4x)

Lumber, lumbar, Jack and I be nimble
Hurt you like a whiffle ball and bring it to a sequel
Shadows, shadows, know where Daddy Rich lurks
Verse got a gold tut like Mrs. Butterworth's
You said he couldn't, but he said "I got wood"
I think I can, I think I can, no I could
Yell timber, cause your wood is slimmer
Yet another victim serviced by the Goldfinger
Cuts stimulate, chop on the flavor hit the Ave.
On the wax and vibrate like a ninja
Mr. Daddy Rich to you, used to call him ???
Run and you're stumbling over stumps, so watch him fall
Yes y'all, he got the skills to spin it
So yo ho ho and a bottle full of Cisco
Can't find the grooves in a spasm while I'm rhyming
Up the track Lumberjack and on the darn timing

"You know, a judo, a chop chop chop"
"Swing swing swing, and chop chop chop" (Repeat 4x)
