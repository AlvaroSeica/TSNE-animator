[Justin Timberlake]
There's somethin 'bout your body
I'm not in a rush
But girl I'm ready to marry you
Yeah right here in this restaurant
And start on our honeymoon
while you still got your dress on...
Why you still got your dress on?
Ohh yeahhhhh

[Interlude: Justin Timberlake]
Now I ain't tryin to offend nobody
But girl don't they see you
It's cool if they don't
Cause hey I only see me and you
That's why I'm all over you
while you still got your dress on...
Why you still got your dress on?
Ooh yeah yeah yeah

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
I can't wait
Cause girl as soon as I look in your face
I see a world where a heart never breaks
And to me that means that the whole world could change
But not mine, I can't wait

[Justin Timberlake]
The way I know your body
I don't really need much
Girl I know where to touch
Just stay where you are
Drop all your worries
and you can leave all the rest on
We can do it, uh
While you still have your dress on
Ohh yeah hohh yeah, uhh

[Interlude]

[Chorus]

[Timbaland]
Let me take ya, so walk with me
through the beautiful sand as we take pictures
Huh, hips so wide look like it's got whiskers
Let me put a solid gold on that solid figure
Haha, go 'head, show your pretty dentures
Your pretty physique, your pretty toes, I'm pretty wit'cha
I do a good job for that pretty picture
You the prettiest but I'm the only thing that's missin

[Chorus] - last line without "I can't wait"

[Outro: Justin Timberlake]
Yeah...
While you still got your dress on
Still got your, still got
Still still still, still got your
While you still got your dress on
I can't wait
Cause girl as soon as I look in your face
I see a world where a heart never breaks
And to me that means the, whole world could change!
But not mine
