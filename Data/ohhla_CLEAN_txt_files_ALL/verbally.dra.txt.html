[Hook/Chorus: Drapht] {X2}
S to the B to the X
Certified to the Wise
We running your dreams, we running this scene
S to the B to the X
Certified to the Wise
It's Pressure and Drapht and we're after the lot

[Verse 1: Pressure]
Verbally flawless, Pressure and Drapht serving the rawness
I take a piss on your parade and skirmish your fortress
Certainly dauntless, you heard that we murder the thoughtless
Life's a gamble and Pressure's a certaintly for this
game of hearts, step - break in half
Don't make me laugh
if you're a conscript you still couldn't take the Draft/Drapht
I'm sick of these maggots claiming that they eat rappers
You are what you eat - and these rappers are weak faggots
Suckers think they're smoother than chilled silk
Huh, your shit's butter while I eat it up, quick iron over spilt milk
Giving the stress, when close talkers give it their best
Your flow ain't intoxicating - that's the gin on your breath
So keep your mouth closed for the best
from the South Coast to the West
The house flows to your chest
We ain't never gonna change, this is life long
The only change that I got's the sixth sense I survive on

[Hook/Chorus]
S to the B to the X
Certified to the Wise
We running your dreams, we running this scene
"Better get on the right team"
S to the B to the X
Certified to the Wise
It's Pressure and Drapht and we're after the lot
"Consider us the hitmen that's knocking you off"

[Verse 2: Drapht]
Verbally I'm unstable, unable to stop the voices
Psychotic turn to fatal the way that I spit the poison
No avoiding the noise, I loiter your fucking comfort zone
Know to never step into this Gladiators thunder dome
Unknown to most, home is where the heart lies
Home should be with Kylie Minouge and with Bec Cartwright
Now but I'm tied down, bound and gagged
Walked all over and dumped on the ground and dragged
around on jagged rocks, to the boondocks and back
If Derapht's in town, every boombox is jacked
No laxidaisical rap, just black resin
While the wack roll like ??? and screwed, you lack presence
or a gift to uplift and rip through the rafters
Rip through ring masters, a solid lion heart is the remedy
An apparatus on the enemy, sending me nuts
can't better the breed of this pedigree
Ready or not, we're ready
Let it be known it's Drapht and Pressure from the land of Ned Kelly's home
and no man can step to this flowman's ability
Feeling my force like the artillery of the military
I guillotine and shredded your Bill of Freedom
Now he's made you beleive that we actually need him
Misleading our name, driving us off a cliff
The only way he could show them who he is
