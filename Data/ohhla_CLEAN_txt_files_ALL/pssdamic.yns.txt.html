[ VERSE 1: Qur'an ]
I strike back with the mic --and track--
When it comes to drums it's like I hyper-react
My mind starts to generate words that penetrate
Then I eliminate suckers who imitate
Once again I reveal the skill
Money's growin' like grass with the mass appeal
It doesn't matter hardcore or commercial
I'm universal, -- rehearsal
The name's Qur'an, consider me a brighter man
I'm climbin charts like Spiderman
A legend in my own time with the microphone I'm
One of the world's most electrifyin --
I dust MC's like a A&amp;C
So sit back and let this young mans peak
Sorry suckers, take a hike
But for now I'ma pass the mic

[ VERSE 2: Tarik ]
Honeydips flip cause they know I'm well equipped
They drop they bottom lip, then they start to unzip
The XYZ but I ain't down with HIV
So I keep my j-i-double m-y
In my backpocket just in case I wanna knock it
When it comes to this I'm sure that I can rock it
Once the mic's passed to me each line has to be
Perfectly fitted cause wack ain't permitted
In my format, no, I ain't for that
Forget it, you can't get with it, hit the door, black
It's time to get props, so check it out, hops
I'm on the road to success and I ain't makin no stops
My style's vernacular, some call it spectacular
-- my mic I be smackin ya
Right about now I'm doin just what I like
My time's up, so I'ma pass the mic

[ VERSE 3: Taji ]
Yo, I'm stable, unable to get on a weak label
You still be home writin watchin me on cable
Steppin to me, yo, you're bound to take a fall
I put you in a pocket like an eightball
I'm gettin paid for my performance on stage
You still be -- makin minimum wage
You -- 
Breakin your neck for a petty little check
You can't complain to restrain my career
--- somethin --- and make things clear
You beat me, yo, your chances are very low
Now you should know that I'm a pro at this
Each time I write a rhyme consider it a hit
You little budget MC, your pockets stay on E
Right now I'm about to take flight
So I'm gonna pass the mic

[ VERSE 4: Mentally Gifted ]
Here's a quick flashback by me on the last track
Get a whiff of this, you won't want none of your cash back
Continuous flavor, I always seem to set you straight
You heard so many wack songs, I couldn't let you wait
Another minute, better yet another second
Cause once I give 'em 1-2 check you know the brother's wreckin
So put me in the books, one of the best who did it
I'm the top soloist, all the rest should quit it
Ain't nothin to it, I'ma do it like I'm hittin skins
And at the same time you can believe I'm gettin ends
I catch fits cause it gets irritative when
Suckers act like they got a creative pen
But they don't, so they need to just settle down
Because it's time to put my foot on the pedal now
Some suckers thought I really couldn't do it right
But for now I'm gonna pass the mic</pre>
