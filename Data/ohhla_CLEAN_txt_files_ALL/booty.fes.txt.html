[Chorus: L.I.S.]
Girl, you got a hot body and on top of all that you got a fatty
The way you look in them jeans, make me drop to my knees
Why don't you shake it for me, me, me...
Why don't you shake it for me?

[L.I.S.]
You got a fatty, mami, that thing look great
I wish I had you on the table right next to my steak
Throw some gravy in the thing just to see how it tastes
Have you feeling like a biscuit that I already ate
Send a shiver through your body, make you cancel our date
So many things on my mind and they came through late
Cuz we on the dancefloor and I'm admiring your shape
You're the baddest in the town, hands down with no debate
I got a lot on my hands but you could fit on my slate
You remind me of this song by L.G. the Great
You got jelly in your pants because jam don't shake
Push some bodies off the scale, you make the solar system shake
Wet dreams of me and you make me skiied up my steak
Don't let me tell you that the pasta's great
I wanna live out my dreams, lemme plead my case
I seen you five times in five different states
One in A.T.L. breaking it down on skates
The party don't start 'til you enter the place
Got me humming like a bird to the beat while you shake
You remind me of this song by L.G. the Great
You got jelly in your pants because jam don't shake

[Chorus]

[Pa Bazil]
Very fatale with plenty of style
I like the way you draw crowds, drop jaws on miles
Eyes gal, well endowed, built like a stallion
Had an amazing name, pure-breded from the islands
No, I'm not lying, if I wasn't playing I would stop flying
Use me, abuse me and turn me into scrap iron
A glorious, gorgeous creature with the features
If you find out she was cheating you probably wouldn't leave her
Keep her cellphone, two way and beepers, a way to reach her
You definitely gon' need her cuz she's off the meters
Had me strung like some laces on sneakers on a pair of Adidas
I'm telling you, man, the ultimate in divas
Call her true pulita, Latin descent, better known as mira
Drive me crazy when you call me papi, mamacita

[Chorus]

[Lon Dini]
I play low, go 'head, ma', shake it for ba' bro'
The stage so nice, I never paid the price for twat
Give me a chance, I might tip me a spot
Don't worry about my spouse
The mountain that I drop could buy a house
I monkey fuck 'em, thug 'em and drug 'em out
Dick might bug 'em out, the way a nigga thug it out

[Fes Taylor]
Baby girl, make your booty twirl
Wait 'til I hurl, bent, pull it on the curls
Bring on my boys or girls into girls
Get Fresh, we could have anything in this world
Models and actresses, they all love the backshots I give
That's your wiz?
Come on, playa, you hear the song, playa
After the show, probably go perform with her later

[Chorus] </pre>
