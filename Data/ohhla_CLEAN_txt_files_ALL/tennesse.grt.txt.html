Tennessee boys, GIRLS
dirty south boys, GIRLS
tennessee boys, GIRLS
dirty south boys

t e (tennessee)
double n e (tennessee)
double s
now double e
now spell that out, it's tennessee
no matter where I be
everybody say it loud for me
travel from state to state
It's gonna be my home place

bonafides my name
to change the games my aim
gone break the chain and steak my claim
while putting nashville all on the brain
with a twist of the mid south twang
and a little bita bounce to bang
gone feed the soul and crowd the floors
and take control and break the mold
kick the doors and spit the flows
we in the pros what you aint know
cause round here they caddy roll
with gold grills and twenty wheels
on jefferson at mary ribs
bounce to this from state to fisk
we keep it hot for every spot
been round the world done seen a lot
to all the boys out on the block
got love for yall for real dog
you the reason im here at all
and took the call to break the fall
and show the way from where I stay
In tennessee boy the dirty south boy

65 south ridin dirty window down open mouth
spirit stirred off the sermon I just heard that's my word
dipped and doused
awakened quickly mold me shape me but first strip,
hold me take me to extremes in my reside
though it seems i'm so beside
myself in this state i'm place in open the box my fate
encased in break the seal and let me out
In tennessee thats what i'm talkin bout
now i'm here not much can stop me you
a supporter if you got this copy now show dem
pearlies boys and girlies buff and burlies straight
and curlies no surprises, where we at got all shapes
and sizes put on the brakes remove all disguises
erupt like geysers, sound off one time (wooh)
whether sadistic legalistic outcast, or misfit
fortune teller mystic, ones who love god
revere him fear him these and more found in my district</pre>
