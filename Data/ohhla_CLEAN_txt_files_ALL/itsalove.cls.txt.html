[Intro]
Bring the bass in
Uhh, I love it
Yeah

[CL Smooth]
You're beautiful, the way you wear that, share that
Had many ladies, but nothin can compare to that
smile that style that drives men wild
That ring could have big daddy walk you down the aisle
Proper - you a show-stopper, girl a jaw-dropper
I could see me leavin soons as I bring it home to momma
What you're lookin at is pure-bred stallion
I'm slayin it, you really care to know who's J'n it
Uhh, how lucky are we? Catch you comin out the shower
and I'm right there to wipe down your body
Spread that scented lotion all around your curves
Anything you want, all she deserves
Baby calm your nerves, make this work
The only thing you fear in life is bein hurt
But I'm here to protect you - thought otherwise?
I'm here to correct you - you can trust me

[Chorus: CL Smooth speaking over singer]
It's bonafide, it's so deep
I got your back, we in this for life
We the truth, I'm by your side baby
It's a love thing baby

[CL Smooth]
You and I? Now that's a hot couple
Put us both in the same club, now you ask for nothin but trouble
Watch 'em jumpin out of red labels
Got my woman and her girlfriends dancin on the tables
Shut down the joint, me I'm just laid back in awe
Surrounded by the gangsters, puffin on a cigar
Baddest chick in the word keep niggaz trend
Yes the hottest chick on the planet keep a nigga rent up
The question is can you top that homey?
You can probably pull somethin close but stop that homey
Not even~! Couldn't have that even if I stopped breathin
Don't hope for that, my ghost'll be pokin her still
Read my will, my boys get it all, no gimmicks
But I'm here to let you know my jump-off is off limits
Life and love, you're made for a thug
Once I settled in, you made me a gentleman

[Chorus]

[CL Smooth]
Tote game is crazy, diamonds on stilettos
Travel through these ghettos, drop the top
Let 'em see what I'm workin with, came to win
How the don keeps a fawn to blow in the wind
Her aura's magnetic, that attracts loot
She look Wall Street, briefcase, pinstripe suit
Your hair up in a bun, spectacles on her nose
Any deal she makes, my business grows
Uhh, they say a woman's never satisfied
'til she have me to fill her to her heart's content
It's my blessing, God gave you to me
And words can't describe what you do for me
Your CL is love me or love me not
But no one can match this chemistry we got
Why they all call you CL's wife?
Cause all we got is each other, a bond for life, uhh

[Chorus]
