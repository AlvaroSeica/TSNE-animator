  (sample)
If we all reacted the same way we'd be predictable
  (sample)
Life perpetuates itself through diversity.
A copy is just an identical image
Copies do not give rise to variety and originality

(Helixx Of Anomolies)
I never walk with blind sight 
See through the darkness by a dim light
Imploy divine write, paint a picture off a foresight
Bear witness to the power unseen, like a fiend's dream
Stimulating means, transmitting through your bloodstream
But, before you detox, I make ya knees drop
Release the G-Shock, we believes ya breathing
Never conceiving or even understanding how I made you
Because I'm playin you 
I broke you down to nothing left you crumbling every angle
Never-ending story it's like a beginning
Given every mediocre trend is useful to it's sinning
Bending over all the cases, staying true means in the basement
While the others lay the sound
And create music from defacement
All the time, a certain state of mind defines secular
Music that exceeds a higher plain but becomes irregular
And everyone's reaction is that we're a minor fraction
Of a culture that is thriving just on worldly satisfaction
But it's okay
I seen the signs ignite, just layed forte
No more stray, I know the mallets that they portray
So, I stay, Helixx see armageddon
For the conservation of my presence, fuck the word acceptance
I get triple 7's every time I finish sparking sessions
Choose your own discression, I'm on a black to score attention
All in what I mention, they want a means for intervention
Learn another lesson only you can choose the right direction

(Jise-One Of Arsonists)
My story in heart, scarify your own opponent
No clemicy(?) for the opposed in my way of life for roaming
In a moment I will conquer edacious attitudes
Full of greed, bitterness and leave us, without an avenue
Therefore to brother needs suddenly got fillin back energy
Entering my presence which leads to fury essense
My testament to decimate your auto-torments
Tournaments is sharpen bargain it wanna sight my need for sense
Mentals travel the world blockless the prefer miscreant
You fall if youth depends on the pen you see's not your friend
Spend half my time settin Presidents' more events
While these guys eat my style, get signed for what I invent

(Chorus)
(both) 
That's why I DON'T WANNA BE AN EMCEE
THE DEFINITION'S ALL FUCKED UP
(Jise)
You gotta know the right artilery 
(both) 
AND I DON'T WANNA BE AN EMCEE
THE DEFINITION'S ALL FUCKED UP 
(Helixx)
Too many rumours stay around me 
(both)
That's why I DON'T WANNA BE AN EMCEE
THE DEFINITION'S ALL FUCKED UP 
(Jise)
This shit is sick and they're no remedy 
(both)
AND I DON'T WANNA BE AN EMCEE
THE DEFINITION'S ALL FUCKED UP
IT'S JUST US AGAINST THE INDUSTRY 

(Jise-One)
Upon my ministry you worship, I shed my blood uncoerced
Cherish every sound and rhyme for the wound is serviced
My Arsonists attire spit fire for sabotage
Camoflauge through a collage, disposable mirage
My heart purchased like the bars, too hard to rap with simpletons
Middle-men were placed in the front of men, to riddle em
Come on you kiddin me triz, only cause me chuckle tickles
I cripple temples and went through to mental this stress and missile
My instrumentals chaperone my wordplay it indents you
Walk through panels of horror now I'm a rebel bustin my neck
But above the level I'm Jise-One snatch your enterprise
Set course when I preform to you, new tot-ter-y eyes

(Helixx)
Too many rumours spread like tumors who's the cause for the reaction
Though the mouth's dry like crowd spittin words without you askin
Talkin shit but fortified lips in, contradictions
False facts, cause depictions plus descripted
By the deadly stalkers who feed off of gossip to get stronger
Or the person that believes the lies although they known you longer
Am I wrong to over-analyze the situation present
Should I stay in the back and, let these leeches use my essense
Only in your pendants can I see the one-eyed vision
My decision to say fuck off to those I see that's bitchin 
My decision to say fuck off to those I see that's bitchin
(scratch: "EMMMMCEEEEE")
