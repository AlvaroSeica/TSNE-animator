[Intro: Miley Cyrus]
Ah! Hey! Ummmmmm!!! Hey!

[Verse One: Snoop Lion]
Tonight there's gonna be a whole 'lot of smoke in the a-ir
Blow it all, for the ones who the ones who ain't h-ere
Seems like everyday we puttin one six feet undergr-ound
So blessed, what goes up, must come d-own

[Bridge: Miley Cyrus]
Now my buzz is gone and I need to re-up on reality 
And let them see me we can lead the buzz on it
Is there any possibility that everyone feels like meeeeeee?!!!! Yeahhhhh!!!!! 

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
Ashtrays, and heartbreaks, I lost some, let's toast one
So put 'em high, let's reminisce
Your dyin, but your never missed
Ashtrays, and heartbreaks, I lost some, let's toast one
So raise the glass, to the memories
Set 'em free and fill up all the ashtrays
Fill up all the ashtrays!!!!
Yeahhhhhhh!! Uh oh! Hey!
Yeahhhhh!!! uh oh! Hey! Hey!

[Verse Two: Snoop Lion]
Tomorrow when you wake up and realize life ain't fa-ir
Throw it back, and make the whole world disappe-ar
You never miss what you had until it's g-one
When it's right, something always will go wr-on
Yeah!

[Bridge: Miley Cyrus]
Now my buzz is gone and I need to re-up on reality 
And let them see me we can lead the buzz on it
Is there any possibility that everyone feels like meeeeeee?!!!! Yeahhhhh!!!!! 

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
Ashtrays, and heartbreaks, I lost some, let's toast one
So put 'em high, let's reminisce
Your dyin, but your never missed
Ashtrays, and heartbreaks, I lost some, let's toast one
So raise the glass, to the memories
Set 'em free and fill up all the ashtrays
Fill up all the ashtrays!!!!
Yeahhhhhhh!!  Hey!
Ah Ah! Hey!

[Bridge: Miley Cyrus]
Now my buzz is gone and I need to re-up on reality 
And let them see me we can lead the buzz on it
Is there any possibility that everyone feels like meeeeeee?!!!! Yeahhhhh!!!!! 

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
Ashtrays, and heartbreaks, I lost some, let's toast one
So put 'em high, let's reminisce
Your dyin, but your never missed
Ashtrays, and heartbreaks, I lost some, let's toast one
So raise the glass, to the memories
Set 'em free and fill up all the ashtrays
Fill up all the ashtrays!!!!
Yeahhhhhhh!!  Uh!

Oh! Yeahhhhh!!! Yeahhhh!!! Ohhhh!!!!!
Hey! Yeahhhhhhhhhh!!!!
