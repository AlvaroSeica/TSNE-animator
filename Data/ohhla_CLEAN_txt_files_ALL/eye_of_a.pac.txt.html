[ VERSE 1: Pacewon ]
Cold days, Long John, snorkel
Eyes scopin all new heads that walk through
Stick-up kids, narcs and them auto squad Newark dudes
Customers and new chicks to talk to
Money in my pocket, the hustler's love
You can't knock it, first the re-up, then the profit
Next is me shoppin for a cute new droptop to hop in
Candy apple, let's get it poppin
Or maybe it's midnight blue, let's get it crackin
Bathing Ape fashion, mall-to-mall dashin
Chick to chick skippin, trippin
Eight thousand dollars on champagne, sickenin
Eyes pop right out the sockets, locked on what I'm dipped in
Like I'm the Highlander and this is the quickenin
Sporty like the Thievz, I got Pigeons
Like Milk and Giz I'm Top-Billin
Won

[ CHORUS ]
It's been a long time comin, I seen a lotta evil
Felt a lotta pain and I lost a lotta people
Did a couple things that I really didn't need to
Hurt a couple people that I really didn't mean to
If I could turn time back I would treat 'em regal
Matter of fact, I'd treat everybody equal
Then my world might just be so peaceful
And I wouldn't view it through the eye of a needle

[ VERSE 2: Pacewon ]
Chancellor and Union like Crenshaw and Slauson
There's more Bloods here than Red Sox in Boston
One came through with a semi-auto flossin
My boys didn't hesitate to let one run across him
Now ( ? ) but look what it almost cost him
His moms, grandma and his friends almost lost him
We had him runnin more fast than Steve Austin
He didn't wanna do it, somebody prolly forced him
I hope he told that somebody that I'm awesome
The .380 stay in the whip as a precaution
A nine-m stay in my grip for any horsin
Around, in a showdown, clown, I'm takin yours, son
A little quote from Kane, Big Daddy
I walk up and down the block with six baggies
Lookin for the customers headed to me
I hope I won't have to leave a brother dead in the street
You know

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 3: Pacewon ]
My life is like a sitcom with Mac-10s and Uzis gettin gripped on
Little teenage bitches gettin they strip on
By the day, by night gettin they trick on
Little teenage niggas gettin they flip on
Long tee hidin which gat the hip on
Which hip the gat on, each beat I rap on
Just another platform for me to yap on
Peepee and crap on, ( ? ) and slap on
Freak-leak and mack on, sneak, peek and snack on
See me get back on beef, speak and snap on
Mr. Green made 'em just for me to crack on
To explain how I used to get my jack on
And how I've changed to where you hear it in my rap song
Extend my hand and get my dap on
Do like Martin Luther King and get my black on
