Yeah, Vinnie Paz baby
2 G baby
Army of the Pharoahs
All that good shit

[Ikon the Hologram]
Yo, yo
The Lawnmower Man smashes
Through your skull with battle axes
We whip asses with the jaws and daggers
That slashes
Crushing opposition like we was fascists
Stigmata and full gashes
We bashes, the faggots who can't attack it right
Take they sternum and then turnin 'em into my acolytes
That's the sight of blood that make a child stop
That's the rights of thugs that keep it wild hot
I hate you, say to pray to a heavenly father
It's fatal, like a NATO military armada
We hotter, warriors from Atlantis
Couldn't overstand how raw the Hologram is
The mantis who use the flame rod
'Cause y'all couldn't physically bruise the name God

[Diamondback]
Yo the technique, detrimental to your immune
Leave you in the dust, let y'all niggas choke on fumes
It's the type nice, aerodynamic, gigantic
Shadow I cast is dominant, royal highness
North Philly's own home-grown cham-pion
Purposely remainin' unknown until shone
Cold as stone, the stage, my home away from home
I prefer to leave these clone niggas alone
Buildin' a home for lost MC's gone wrong
Feel the pressure when my team come on strong, it's QD

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
{*scratches*}
[Black Thought: Never try to 
duplicate the skills executed son]
Listen up y'all suckas to what I say
Breakin out in unstoppable...

[Jus Allah]
Megatrauma's fuckin' monstrous
Hoppin' outta Lake Loch Ness
Every motherfucker and range is left topless
Roam the metropolis like shit's copless
Y'all cock-less, we stuff y'all in boxes
For stuffed pockets, yo my thugs is thick
Thug'll crisp 'em, when we gotta put a slug in your bitch
Spotted your dame, Pharoahs, we shatter your brain
'Til a nigga salary change to lateral gain
Like Calgary Flames, puttin' fire on ice
Put me in hell, for puttin' four nails in Christ

[Louis Logic]
I'm like Billy Goat Gruff under the bridge and Governor Ridge
Waitin' to knock heads off, I'm a mean son-of-a-bitch
With an itch to misbehave and wave a switchblade
In front of your face so close to leave your whiskers shaved
So disengage, or rip the pages from your notepad
And shove 'em up the hole between your lower back and gonads
The only way your rhymes would be the shit
You need to read a script on playin' gay 'cause you cats could eat a dick
Servin' sucka MC's a fifth of the drunken stylin'
Rippin' M-I-C's like a pub in Dublin, Ireland

[Chorus]

[B.A. Barakus]
Hey yo I got a fetish, to see flesh rip
When my tec spits, breakin' the bone where your chest is
I dare a nigga to try'n battle
I put the sweat in your palms when you swallowed your Adam's apple
Eat emcees like chupacabra was eatin' cattle
And feed disease with palabras, frequently rattle
I make the hardest man fall back and start to squeal
Hold a fifth to his face, taste the steel
The squad I got roll deep and stay ruthless
You're useless, fuck with us, ya' leave toothless
We often known as psycho drama dispensers
Paralyze niggas and put 'em in trauma centers

[Chorus repeat 2x]</pre>
