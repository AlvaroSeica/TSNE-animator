Song:   Long Ago
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Intro from "Phantom of the Paradise"]
"Gentlemen, I give you the future"

[Chorus 2X: lyrics from the same movie]
Owwwww! Our paths have crossed and parted
This love affair was started long, long ago

[D-Sisive]
I'm a, parade rainer, Rainn Wilson
Spit Graceland on 80 milligram painkillers
My veins are swimmin in HS virgos
'Til William Head's left with red circles
Closed casket, cocaine, a dope addict
with a full blown habit
Soarin over the rainbow, no Kansas, standin ovation
Tippy toe standin, a Busey full blown
Past your #1 rapper, I double lapped him
with no signs of slowin down
I'm goin after the gold; and after that the platinum
Then assassinate my fans with an ice cold
glass of lipsmackin delicious cyanide
Mixed with a full packet of red powder
My shrink begs me to stop
but the voices in my head beg to differ and beg louder
So, long

[Chorus]

[Muneshine]
Rap is a disease; consider Mune, Robert Smith
I grew up on Degrassi and John-o-Vision
I grew up on the Circle, Maestro, and Monolith
Common Sense, Fresh out from Philly silly, Rob was Prince
No Purple Rain, Bob James "Nautilus"
A vintage modernist, Rob was an optimist
My inner misogynist, positive, all for kicks
Leavin girls tuckin out and duckin out, God forbid
T&amp;A in my DNA, I was cold (yup!)
Weird scientists alliance formed long ago (yup!)
Thinkin MJ was right? "You Are Night Alone"
In a world of Yeezy, Weezy and Shawn Carter clones
This is easy, for me it's no dumb stunt
You fail in a year, we excel in one month
Blunt, I exhale yes we're
the best no comparison a breath of fresh air

[Chorus]</pre>
