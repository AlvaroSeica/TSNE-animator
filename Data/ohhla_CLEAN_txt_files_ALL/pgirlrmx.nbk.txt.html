Oooh
Magic (NB Ridaz)
Hookin' up with Dyablo
For that mamacita
What's going on, pretty girl (To all those pretty girls, pretty girls)
Hey (This one's for you)
I wanna talk to you, girl, come here (This one's for you)
Let me tell you somethin' (This one's for you)
Check this out

Chorus: MC Magic
Something about you, baby (Something about, you)
Drives, me, crazy
Something about this pretty girl
Blows, my, mind (Blows my mind)
Something about you, baby
Drives, me, crazy
Something about this pretty girl
Blows, my, mind

[Verse 1: MC Magic]
Si tu supieras lo que siento
Cada vez
Que me pongo a pensar en todos los momentos
All the good times we've had, me and you, you and I
Hot summer nights, making love in July
The only girl that didn't give it on the first night
Una mujer incomparable, I'm a love her life
Me captivaste with your ways and all the things you do
My pretty girl
I gotta make it work with you
Tell the world, tell your girls, and your family
Con esto a mio, te prometo, you're my everything
Cause nobody's ever made me feel the way you do
I just dropped you off
Already miss you
Chica bonita, sonrisa, sincera
I wanna be with you hasta que me muerda (That's right)
Let's make a pact
And always be together
With you by my side, girl, I'm down for whatever

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 2: Dyablo]
Solo una
Es en la vida, el amor, te toca el alma
Un sentimentio limpo, que hasta el dolor, te calma
Siempre estuvistes conmigo, en la buenas
Y las malas conmigo
Solo Dios y tu son mi testigo
Inorvidables momentos, que juntos pasamos
Y los problemas mas fuertes, juntos areglamos
Incomparable mujer
A ti yo pertenecer
Contigo, yo fallecer
Juntos como un solo ser
Una preciosa mujer, que siempre esta a mi lado
Que en el dolor y las tristesas, me has acompanado
Quieres mi vida, te le entrego, si es lo necesario
Pues, en mi mente y corazon, te tengo, yo del diario
Te has incrustado tu en mi corazon (Mi corazon)
Como un implante, eres mi salvacion (Mi salvacion)
Eres mi todo, mi razon de ser
De la creacion, la perfeccion, una bella mujer

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 3: Zig Zag]
You stood
Out from your crew
From across the room
I had to keep, my attention on you (Hello)
Somethin'
About that
Pretty face, that pretty smile
You couldn't help but to get lost in those pretty eyes
Yeah, this girl, she had it all (Yeah)
The type of woman that you
Take to mother
Saying "Look what I found"
Love and companionship
Someone to talk
Through these rough times (Yeah)
Who ain't afraid to handle it (Hello)
And understands that my life is different
And accepts it
This isn't
What I expected
Yeah, she beautiful
Inside and out
Somethin' hard to find in the world these days
Even in my worst day
Heh ha
She's got me happy
Like a kid, wakin' up on his birthday
Yeah
This love was different, it was based on friendship
I'm letting you down (Come on)
I'm ready to ride out with it

Repeat Chorus</pre>
