[Bronze Nazareth]
Yo it's the mixtape, acquit rape over the fall of your career
Call it autumn leaves, the scene's severe
Caught in a heap, dig in your skin like a sporting cleat
And pull out meat like a hungry tiger's teeth
Or shark jaw, I'm 'South Paw' we can get out, brawl
Or be peaceful, takes these jewels and teach too
I spring, roll and weave
Ugly dreams while my green schemes more automatic than submachines
Come in Queens on auto tricycling
You over thick homegirl try and cycle in the goer's gym
I'm so grim, I just want an evil __ like the sun hitting skin
Or glass Joe's jaw, reflect like Silvia Browne
Or how I'm spilling your crown if you in ___
The villain clown, murderous circus
Weave through lanes like your girl's horses
My voice is hoarse from choruses
Light up your grill like Christmas porches
Inhale the forest, high as Saturn's rings
My Grey matter stings, scatter ashes and stab kings
Mental East Michigan, only bling is the chrome pistols
Only bring home the gemstones and the mentals
Bent folds over the ambassador
The classic raw rap catalogue
Black talent claw verses from out of churches
My shit is gonna be classic, don't pass the purchase
