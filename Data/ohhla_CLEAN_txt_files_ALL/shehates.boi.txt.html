Sir Lucious L...
(La, la, la, la
La, la, la
La, la, la, la
Hmmm, hey!)

She said she love me when I'm gone, she miss me being home
I'm always at the studio, that makes her alone
Recently, she even seems to hate on all my songs
Deleted my pictures, took my face up out her phone
"Where did we go wrong?" I'm sitting here thinkin'
She said the weed too strong, it keeps my breath stinkin'
Dizzy high, I ride away in my Lincoln
Close my eyes and fly away, but no blinkin'
I'm just dreamin', she ain't really screamin'
It goes both ways and I was trying to get even
Lost my whole evening mostly for no reason and
just my broken weaslin', now I'm tryin' to ease it in
Came home late, I just put the key in
It would probably be straight if she was European
She's not, she's hot and mad as she can be
If you can hate on anybody, girl, I'm glad it was me

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
She hates me (I know it, I know)
She hates me (I know it for sure)
But I'mma make her love me
I'mma - I'mma make her love me
But I'mma make her love me, again
She hates me (La, la, la)
She hates me (I know it for sure)
But I'mma make her love me
I'mma - I'mma make her love me, again
But I'mma make her love me, again

[Big Boi]
I mean, it started with the rose petal, ended with the stem
By the car, while I was thinking "Damn, here we go again"
We used to hold hands and had such deep convo
Make a few plans like, you wanna go where I'mma go?
Well, let's leave pronto and that's what we did
Then we yelled out geronimo and jumped off that bridge
Had a couple kids, you can move where I live
I know old ass niggas that's scared to do what I did
The shoe still fits, but I'm wearing out the sole
Sometimes, I really feel as if I'm burnin' out my soul
I should have a lot, been preparin' for my show
but instead everybody keeps dick ridin' my flow
Now I know I ain't white bitch, but bitch, I ain't broke
If she actin' like a bitch, I guess we're around white folks
Forgive me if I raise my voice, I won't raise a hand
but one thing I will do, baby, is raise my little man

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
She hates me...
She hates me...
But I'mma make her love me
I'mma make her love me
I'mma make her love me, again
She hates me (La, la, la, la)
She hates me (La, la, la)
But I'mma make her love me
I'mma make her love me
I'mma make her love me, again

[Kid Cudi]
La, la, la, la
La, la, la
But I'mma make her love me
I'mmma - I'mma make her love me
But baby, let me fix this
But girl, let me fix it
La, la, la, la
La, la, la
But I'mma make her love me
I'mmma - I'mma make her love me
But babe, let me fix it
Baby, let me fix it...
But babe, let me fix it
Baby, let me fix it</pre>
