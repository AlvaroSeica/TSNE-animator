[Verse One: Uncle Murda]
Bitch I let my money work, in California
Bitch I'm with the mexicans, in Arizona
Bitch I'm talkin pure white, for every thousand grand
Bitch I'm talkin white girls, on the Peter Pan
Bitch I'm sittin at the light, in some big shit
Talkin big shit, listenin to B.I.G. shit (Biggie!!!)
Quarter mill for my big chains, tell papi I need a hundred things
(A hundred homey!!!) Nigga you heard me a hundred things!!!!
Bitch I let my money work, I'm blowin thousands
Bitch I got my whole crew out of public housin
Tell Hoover, tell Meech to tell Ross I got that!
The police, the f boys, the DEA can't stop that!
That nina, that 40, that AK I pop that!
That Louis, that Gucci, that fly shit I rock that!
That new deal with Epic and Sony I got that!
(I got that!) Nigga you heard me I got that!

[Chorus: Sample from Rick Ross]
Girl I let my money work, work let my money work
Girl I let my money work, work let my money work
Girl I let my money work, work let my money work
Girl I let my money work, work let my money work
Girl I let my money work, work let my money work
Girl I let my money work, work let my money work
Girl I let my money work, work let my money work
Girl I let my money work, work let my money work

[Verse Two: French Montana]
I'm puttin overtime bitch I let my money work
You know I overgrind bitch now I'm 20 worth (Milli)
Still ridin dirty hangin on the stake mayne
Talkin 40 Shawn Kemp for the break mayne
Me and Murda on the back block servin it
Higher than a motherfucker feel turbulence
I let my money twerk (Twerk) let my bitches smurk (Smurk)
Let the dogs go, let them drivers scurve
I know some actresses, I know some porn stars
I own some businesses, I got some sports cars
Hundred grand we spent that, little bars I'm in that
Hottest niggas we been that, fast cars we in that
Corrections try to slay me, won't see me on a wanted poster
Stand up with the work, countin money all in one motion
I'm talkin same damn time 
Knowin I'm a make ;em when I was way back grindin, Coke Boy!

[Chorus: Sample from Rick Ross]
Girl I let my money work, work let my money work
Girl I let my money work, work let my money work
Girl I let my money work, work let my money work
Girl I let my money work, work let my money work
Girl I let my money work, work let my money work
Girl I let my money work, work let my money work
Girl I let my money work, work let my money work
Girl I let my money work, work let my money work</pre>
