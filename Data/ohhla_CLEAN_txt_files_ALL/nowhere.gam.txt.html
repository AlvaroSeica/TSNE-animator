[Intro: Childish Gambino]
I'm so drunk tonight and I, I don't got nowhere to go
I'm so drunk tonight and I, I don't got nowhere to go
I'm so drunk tonight and I, I don't got nowhere to go
I'm so drunk tonight and I, I don't got nowhere to go

[Childish Gambino]
Childish Gambino; I'm trying to hold my liquor
A vomit stain on my t-shirt, a +Sick Boy+ but getting sicker
I don't really wanna take another marijuana
But I do it cause I'm stupid and it hits me I'm a goner
