Song:   What Will They Say
Typed by: @IAmKinetik

[Intro: Kinetik]
This song was written in the spirit of my grandparents
John Matthew Watt, who passed away on the 21st of July 1993
And Delzeta Watt, who passed away on the 3rd of January 2007
I miss them dearly

[Verse 1: Kinetik]
So easily we're getting caught up in the extra living
We keep our house and our car in the best condition
And for the next position
We get rich or die trying irrespective of the repetition
But the funniest thing in this world where money is king
We're the slaves to the ways that the currency brings
And cause of that very lust we keep our treasuries stuffed
So we can live heavy and plush but it can never be enough
It's that tragic
And it seems that we care less about our characters and even more about our tax brackets
And now our basic needs are like make believe cause we're fixated by the face of greed
But after the last breath when we're stiff as a board
When we're in the past tense and then we're shipped to the morgue
Know whatever we make here, we can't take it there
And we'll be empty handed when we go and visit the Lord

[Chorus: Kinetik]
So what will they say when you close your eyes
And what will they say when your life goes by
And what will they say when your time is through
And when it's over, what will they say about you
What will they say when you close your eyes
And what will they say when your life goes by
And what will they say when your time is through
And when it's over, what will they say about you

[Verse 2: Kinetik]
Way before the u-stream and the computer screens
I was renowned as a person in pursuit of dreams
My lofty aspirations became an afterthought
I stopped reaching for the sky as if my arms were short
And it's not as if I didn't try
Cause even though my feet were on the ground, my head was in the sky
Just merely drifting, bitter and pessimistic
And looking at the world as an enemy
Then one day I took a trip to the cemetery
I felt a mixture of peace with serenity
I read a tombstone that sticks in my memory
It said this person had left with a legacy
And I was frozen, truly overcome with emotion
Cause one day I know that I'll return to the essence
So as my minutes turn into seconds, I question
Will you laugh or cry when you remember me?

[Chorus]

[Outro: Ileen Mitchell]
The hour of departure has arrived and we go our separate ways
I to die and you to live. These are the words of Socrates
and it demonstrates that life and death is but a meeting place
It is a place of passing on the baton from one to another
Therefore, it is of vast importance that the lessons we learn
from living is safely transported into the hearts and minds
of those who yet remain

One will need to fight for what they need
but not by using man-made arsenals
but through the education of the mind
and the repositioning of our thought processes
by bringing it into line with that which was purposed
for us before our birth
We are here to fulfil our full potential
and not take it with us to the graveyard
In so doing, the graveyard will become richer for it
and lies poorer for us not delivering
that which we were sent here to do.

It is said by keen thinkers like Dr. Maya Angelou
that we are standing on the shoulders of those
who have gone this way before
So as we are now in a place of transition
supported by the past and reaching up to the future
continue to excel, continue to do right
continue to achieve, continue to invest
in those looking up to you, because one day
they too will be standing on your shoulders</pre>
