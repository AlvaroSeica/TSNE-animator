[Intro: J. Cole] + (Kendrick)
Me and my bitch, took a little trip
Down to the garden, took a little dip (oh no)
Apple juice fallin from her lips
Took a little sip (boom) little sip
Took a little sip, took a little sip
Took-took a little, took a little, took a little sip, uh
Uh-huh

[J. Cole]
Aiyyo I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
Where niggaz hold tec's like they mad at the ref
That's why I keep a cross on my chest, either that or a vest
Do you believe, that Eve had Adam in check?
And if so, you gotta expect
to sip juice from the forbidden fruit and get LOOSE
Huh, Cole is the king, most definite
My little black book thicker than the old testament
Niggaz pay for head but the pussy's sold separate
Same bitch givin brains to the minister
The same reason they call Mr. Cee "The Finisher"
Forbidden fruit, watch for the Adam's apple
Slick with words, don't hate me son
What you eat don't make me shit and who you fuck don't make me cum
Put a price on my head won't make me run
Try to kill me but it cain't be done
Cause my words gon' live forever
You put two and two together Cole here forever

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar] + (J. Cole)
Me and my bitch, took a little trip
Down to the garden, took a little dip - oh no
Apple juice fallin from her lips
Took a little sip - boom
Bitches, come and, go (you know that)
Money, come and, go (you know that)
Love, come and, go (don't shit last)
Bitches, come and, go (you know that)
Money, come and, go (you know that)
Love, come and, go (don't shit last)

[J. Cole]
Take a seat baby girl you've been all in my mind
I know I ain't called, gotta pardon my grind
Just copped a Maroon 5, no Adam Le-vine
Came a man by myself, only Father was Time
I know that she relate, baby daddy ain't shit
So she raised that nigga kids but she's swallowin mine
And that's why you all in my mind
All on my line like caller number nine
Cause a nigga poppin like Harlem in the nine-seven
Way before Ma$e was a reverend
I was a young nigga makin A's at 11
or 12, tryin to get a taste of the heaven
or hell; only time gon' tell
Fuck her while her momma home, "Baby don't yell"
How many records do a nigga gotta sell
just to get the cover of the double-X-L
or Fader; FUCK ya magazine hater
When I say that I'm the greatest I ain't talkin 'bout later
I'ma drop the album same day as Kanye
Just to show the +Boy's+ a +Man+ now like Wany√°
And I don't mean no disrespect
I praise legends but this what's next
The boy's sick, can't disinfect
Life's a bitch and the pussy's wet
My clip is loaded and this is the kiss of, death
Blaow~!

[Chorus]

[Outro: J. Cole]
Don't shit last, and you know that
Went to hell got hot didn't melt
Only man above me is God himself
All these other niggaz is below me
Word to Phife, Q-Tip, Ali and Jarobi
What up Queens? Cole is the King and you know that
Started with a +Dollar and a Dream+ and you know that
Never give a bird bitch a ring, you should know that
Bitch, biatch! That should be my new ad lib
Biatch! I got a new one
I finally got a cool ad lib
Like some cool shh like biatch!
Be at all the shows everybody be like, biatch!
Biatch! Biatch!
Or you can do the low cool shit, bitch~!</pre>
