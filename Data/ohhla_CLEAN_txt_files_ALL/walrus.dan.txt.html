[Verse 1]
Nothing left to prove
So I'ma hit you with something that's extra smooth
And I'm a give you a muffin with extra blue-
Berries necessary, but you can pick 'em off
That euphemism is lost
Never take what I say at face value
Marinate, what I say it may wow you
Levitate, don't let negative space surround you
Feeling good, feeling great, how are you?
Feeling good, feeling great, how are you?
Still in the hood, building 8, tower 2
Pilates with my gal pal
Spending royalty checks I got from Bow Wow
Ghost writer du jour, on a world tour with Zsa Zsa Gabor
I think I'll prank call Akon and Lady Gaga some more
...nah nah, you borin' 'em
Catch me in Manhattan at the Prada Emporium
My chick got a sick shoe game
But her hips too thick for the hoop chain, mayne
I put her on that Jenny Craig
Diet, hire a private eye from Winnipeg
I catch her slippin' then her food's mine
Instead of steak feed her lines like Gertrude Stein
And she'll be back to normal in no time</pre>
