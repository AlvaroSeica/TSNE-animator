Typed by: Cno Evil

[Kryme Life]
Yo, I've been standing outside in the cold too long
Can't feel it in my hands, but my toes is warm
Cuz I'm walking my dogs, kicking on doors
Fuck knocking, niggas better open up for us
You know we get to huffin and puffin, blowing the house down
The big bad wolf on a big bag of kush
In the studio, bout to blaze up a bush
Bout to throw the single out now, give that a push
Look out for hard to believe, King Beef, remember me
Hood to hood, watch for the documentary
Yes, city to city, every block representing me, yes
It's T.M.F in the flesh, the Kryme Life, I live it
Get that dough, the rap flow is exquisite
Bout to let 'em, if he didn't know, what, how I handle my business
I know how to make a hell of an entrance
Lace something that'll on 'em that'll be a pleasure to witness
We the most anticipated, most underrated
The Most Feared, that's why we the most hated
The Money First, had to take it back to the basics

[Chorus 2X: Kryme Life]
What you gonna do, when the big boys come knocking at your door
And it ain't safe for you anymore
Knock knock, you scared, can't hide, you live

[Blizzy Black]
You ain't gotta let me in, I knock the door off the hinge
And clear it out, before them boys rush in
Grip you from the front, air you out in the back yard
Might clip your man, cuz he sware you a trap star
Sell a few grams, now they think that they back on
Breaking up for bricks, switching just when the cracks gone
I'mma play the streets, I don't wanna be locked in
Understand the fact, that it's family and not friends
When it's all said and done, everybody get boxed in
Six feet deep, under the earth, and
Extended clips, under the shirt
Cuz I'm back in the mix with the crack and the piff
Break it down gradually, packaging shit
It's a full time job, that's my only means of income
Niggas still locked up, just means they didn't run
Open up the door, and now you facing bout two of them

[Chorus 2X]

[Kryme Life]
I switch up flows on it every sixteen bars, it's just me
Niggas love me in the street, cuz my shit be hard
Niggas know who we are, you see the squad
Tommy Tomahawk, Kryme Life, Trife Da God
This year, I'm hitting muthafuckas twice as hard
For schemin', then I swift, quiet snipe the morgue
Run check on these niggas like I'm Michael Jordan
Twist the cap off a hater, like spike and ball
Knock 'em off, the shit that I'm hearing is cotton soft
Got something for the radio, DJ pop it off
Try to tell 'em, 07, that the Wave is coming
And all these muthafuckas know they days is numbered
They don't wanna let me in, bed blue, tear the club up
With a bunch of ruffians, looking for a come up
Still, nothing move but the money, get your ones up
Cuz niggas tend to touch you, when you put your guns up

[Chorus]</pre>
