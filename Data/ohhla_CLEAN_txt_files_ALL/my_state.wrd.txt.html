[Werd]
I hate this
So this is my life, I guess

[Sample]

My motivation is depression and the urge to change
My written words contain, an outlet for pain
I held inside, confined, in this worthless maze
Now my pen bleeds ink to express on page
Hey, is like 'where did ma youth go?'
I wasted most of that, in a booth with a puke flow
I moved around loads through flats in a loophole
And never found myself (nah)
I'm surrounded with people yet I feel so lonely
If only, I held one person closely
Enough, to trust, to talk to solely
I wouldn't need drink and these drugs to hold me
(Up) that's why a feel so shite
Live in fear; shed a tear in the dead of the night
People always going to hate and judge on what I write
I guess a suicide note would be all that they'd like, its like

[Sample]

Why do I still do it, try and move it to loose it
And while am at loose my mind, though its mine to abuse it
Its no crime spitting fluid, but they stopping the flow, damn
But I ain't stopping for no man
I know man, that life's as cold as an old man
Who hates everything because he wasted his whole damn
Life with the tripe and the fight for his own calm
But life's not nice when youre following no plan
Or gave up, but look at things Ive gave up
My whole social life is a mic in mates clubs
My graves up, what more can be said
Lay a flower on it now because I'm already dead
Its like

[Sample]

How would you feel spending your time
Focused on rhymes as your love life's falling behind
Getting chucked out your house as a teen to find
Your own feet in this gritty cold city we reside
And is it fine, being addicted to wine
And weed smokes the only thing that can calm your mind
When petty crime takes the time like right off of school
So now your backpack contains stolen goods and a tool
(Cool) I'm the youth of today
Lead astray with the pencil lead leading the way
And this page is still my best opportunity
So now lets see what few awkward tunes can do
And it will be my release
You can see the real me as I explain on beats
Not the punch-line chat, nah, I go beneath
Because I'm going out my mind, peace
