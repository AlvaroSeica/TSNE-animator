You gotta know the, um exact way to get your point across
(If you say so, if you say so)
You gotta have some game, some gab
(Well if you say so, if you say so)
A way with words, some shit

Well as I stand back and peep you
I'm seein things that the weak do
Words you should never say 
Go on and save it for another day

Twenty-four years on the bullshit planet
Complained every day but boy cannot stand it
Harder than granite just to make ends meet
Harder than that to hold your tounge when you speak
One "fuck you" and you might get beat
One "What's your sign?" and your game turned weak
Names get ruined real quick when you slip
Wrong words lose jobs and fans from your dick
Oops I didnt mean that, they love it when I'm humble
Gotta make attempts to run it back after the fumble
Stumble on words and people think that you're stupid
If you do it too much then they may be correct
Well she gets respect 'cause of what she just said
And he gets head cause hes quick off the head
So much I've seen it, studied it, and mean it
Every time I speak, first I think

Well as I stand back and peep you
I'm seein things that the weak do
Words you should never say 
Go on and save it for another day

Well as I stand back and watch you
I'm seein things that I gotta do
Words that I must say 
Shit I wanna bust today

Bein somewhat cool it all comes from the mind
Knowin what to do is really how ya shine
When people act stupid then its just a cover-up
Nuthin else to think about, scared of fuckin up
Well know when to stop and how to analyze things
Learn about reactions different actions bring
Fuck bein with people who get me into trouble 
`Cause when strangers get heated, then words count double
I bubble off silence, movements, and presence
Sometimes I lose it and use the wrong sentence
Then comes repentance, can you talk your way out?
Walk your way out without defenses
Tenses and timing, alliteration, rhyming
Gestures to go with the speach keep me constantly finding
New ways to be me
In my own place to be and how to function
In this society

Well as I stand back and peep you (you can be smart)
I'm seein things that the weak do (have no game)
Words you should never say (or you can have game)
Go on and save it for another day (and be stupid)

Well as I stand back and watch you (both of those don't work)
I'm seein things that I gotta do (reshape your shit)
Words that I must say (get it together)
Shit I wanna bust today

Well speak up and speak out
Don't doubt your own mouth
Hone what you can get together be a man
Well all you really are is what you really have to say
Don't let a day pass away without livin your way
Givin it your all well that will get you started quick
Learn from what you saw that will make you raw as this
A jewel for flawlessness, and rarely ever miss
I barely ever piss off a person watch the wordin
Every time I'm servin straight sense not a burden
Learn till its curtains and the world stops turnin
Fuck what they earnin we yearnin for real answers
Tryin ta build cancers and still make advances
Too little time not to be about shit
So I'm always on the grind, relateable when I spit

Well as I stand back and peep you
I'm seein things that the weak do
Words you should never say 
Go on and save it for another day

Well as I stand back and watch you
I'm seein things that I gotta do
Words that I must say 
Shit I wanna bust today

Well as I stand back and peep you (watchin you fool)
I'm seein things that the weak do
(shit is so stupid what some of y'all are doin)
Words you should never say 
Go on and save it for another day (save that shit!)

Well as I stand back and watch you
I'm seein things that I gotta do
Words that I must say (gotta say some shit)
Shit I wanna bust today

(Grouch talking over beat)
Got hella shit to say
Tryin to say it right
Open right shit
Use the right words
Right body language and all that shit
It's The Grouch.. Living Legends..
Peace to E.Q.</pre>
