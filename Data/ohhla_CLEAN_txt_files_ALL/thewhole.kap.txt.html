[Madd Kapp]
The hood done got crazy, too many damn rappers
They crawlin out the woodwork, tryin to make it happen
Kids I used to see on the block on they bikes
This shit is evolution, now they pickin up mics
Gettin into fights, tryin to be the man
Tryin to cop the ice almost any way they can
But but they don't understand, somebody come and snatch it
When you get outnumbered run them jewels and your jackets
This shit is entertainment, even though it's real
They got rappers doin life, even rappers gettin killed
Keep your head on straight, if you ever get a deal
Buy equipment of your own when you get your first mill'
I done taught a lot of rappers how to structure they bars
And change voice pitch in the chorus of the song
Sometimes they pay attention, sometimes they just don't
But I'm still a father figure in this game I know and you know

[Chorus]
Things ain't the way that they used to be
The whole motherfuckin hood changed thanks to me
Turned raggedy-ass rappers to real MC's
The whole motherfuckin hood changed thanks to me
Got gangsters to put out albums now you see
The whole motherfuckin hood changed thanks to me
M-A-double-D to K-A-double-P's who I be
The whole motherfuckin hood changed thanks to me

[Madd Kapp]
Motherfuckers turned renegade and try to get at me
Hehehehehe, yeah you hear me laughin
Flattery'll get you nowhere, I know the street shit
I taught you a little but not all the secrets
My record's gettin spun is enough to get even
Your shit ain't even worthy of a website leakin
I take it very serious you weekend warriors
If you can't get the picture then refer to the chorus
The whole motherfuckin hood changed thanks to me
From down river to the nightclubs up in the D
I done done a lot of sufferin to earn my spot
Yeah I admit it~! Madd Kapp drinks a lot
But anywho, it doesn't change the fact that I remain in tact
I'm on my game, I'm back, and here to claim my spot
Cause I'll eventually be on top
Don't ask to freestyle, I get paid to rock - ha

[Chorus]

[Madd Kapp]
I done ghostwrote songs but I can't say names
Cause it's contractual, just another glitch in the game
Money comin in and goin out, it's all the same
Everything's cosmetic man, fuckin with fame
Fame comes in different levels like junior and senior
But the juniors in the hood grindin for the seniors
Forget about the food chain, I do my own thang
Hold my head high, I'ma let my nuts hang
I'm known to get rowdy, but that ain't my every day
Blockbuster on Fort Street's two miles away
I don't hang around motherfuckers act like asses
Speakin out they neck end up eatin they glasses
When you got an album the whole hood be hatin
I'm tryin to stay God Body and ignore the behavior
This is not an act or a cry for attention
This is just the truth that the chorus mentions

[Chorus]

The whole motherfuckin hood changed thanks to me {*4X*}
