Arrest the president

[Verse 1]
Who is the man with the master plan
To smash Iran and then snatch they land?
They stashed Sadaam in the back of a van
Bin Laden chillin up in Amsterdam
They shoulda got him back in Afghanistan
They didn't want him, Haliburtin had to handle
huge oil rigs to feed spoiled kids
Show Bush what unemployment is
Fire him right now. For lying, tie him down!
Put him in handcuffs and send him to Rykers Isle
For giving away his frequent flyer miles
To terrorist relatives on 9/12, flyin em out
The truth is out. No denying it now
Because of the president, next to die is your child
Because the man who attacked us has never been captured
And matter of fact, uh, he used to back the
President, Bush, both old and new
With so much money that they didn't know what to do
Except greed for more, make em bleed for oil
Give money to the rich and never feed the poor
USA's "under seige" like Steven Segal
By a man who can't even count from three to four
And if I get shot just for speakin to ya'll
Arrest George Bush - That'll even the score

[Hook] {X4}

[Verse 2]
Politics, polished tricks
Secret societies in colleges
Home security, more impurities
Little kids cry, "Mommy George is scarin me"
Home invasions in all these nations
What goes around comes around - Immigration
Each press statement's a fabrication
A political porno with penetration
This generation needs integration
Education, But yet we're facing
inflation, high priced medication
Revelations - Jesus save him
Get him outta bed, he don't need vacation
Hit him on the head, make him leave Camp David
Paybacks for ignoring threats from terrorists?
Yo... ARREST THE PRESIDENT!
