Rap hustling nigga what, PJ what
Classic shit, know I'm saying uh feel me
Gotta get it how I live man, straight up
It's the only way nigga, check it out uh what

[PJ]
What's the deal how ya feel, have a drank and chill
PJ displaying skills, gotta get it how I live
It's real time to shine, cause I got it on my mind
Leave these playa haters behind, stay focused on my grind
Niggaz want some'ing for free, but they won't get it from me
Fuck watching TV, better be all you can be
Look at me a G, out the Penitentiary
Did my time didn't wine, back hustling in the streets
Still roll with my heat, cause haters love to beef
Nigga might think I'm weak, gotta knock him off his feet
No surrender no retreat, working like a slave nigga
PJ a made nigga, certified grave digger
Gotta be a paid nigga, watch me draw a picture
When they hear you getting richer, yo they coming to get ya
Grab my bible read a scripture, get me some game
For some it's hard to maintain, cause they not using they brain
They lame me I'm striving, PJ surviving
Put my mama in a home, watch her start smiling
Mouth full of diamonds, I'm coming my nigga
Bank account large amount, yeah I'm coming my nigga
Trunk humming my nigga, stay stunning my nigga
Might see me in the mix, with your woman my nigga
I ain't running my nigga, I'm too bold for that
Too old for that, too cold for that
I ain't running my nigga, I'm too bold for that
Too old for that, too cold for that
I ain't running my nigga, I'm too bold for that
Too old for that, too cold for that
Too thoed for that, nigga yo bitch chose me
You didn't know how to got her, now she rolling with a G
When will niggaz see, that these hoes ain't shit
I got flows to spit, much do' to get
Yeah I'm balling in the mix, staying real with my click
What you see is what you get, this is serious shit
Got models to hit, flood the streets with bricks
Hit lick after lick, FED's won't find shit
