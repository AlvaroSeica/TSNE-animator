[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
I never thought that you and I, would ever meet again
I mourn the loss of you sometimes, and pray for peace within
The word "distraught" cannot describe, how my heart has been
But where do we begin now that, you're back from the dead?
Where do we begin now that, you're back from the dead?
Where do we begin now that, you're back from the dead?

[Skylar Grey]
I held a funeral the day you left
A black umbrella and a sad song in my head (head head head)
Buried your pictures that I loved the most
Cause if you survived me I just didn't wanna know (know know)
So you can't just, come back now, like a demon uninvited
No you can't just, expect me, to open my door to you because

[Chorus]

[Skylar Grey]
I'm so confused I don't know what to feel
Should I throw my arms around you or kill you for real? (real real real)
Cause I worked so hard to put the past to rest
Now it's tumbling down on me just like an avalanche
So you can't just, come back now, like a demon uninvited
No you can't just, expect me, to open my door to you because

[Big Sean]
Yeah, whoa
I know I know I can sit and talk but I can't make you listen
You wish that I paid attention, I thought if I paid admissions
to wherever, go however, it would paint the perfect picture
You said, "No matter how much you fuckin make it doesn't make a difference"
And I'm so so so sorry that we fell in love, Geronimo
It's like, one thing leads to another, swear we're fuckin with dominoes
But here we are, now I'm tryin to find her answer in this bottle girl
And I'm drownin slow (drownin slow) don't let the piranhas know
... But you gon' miss me when I'm gone
Why we gotta wait that long? Baby don-don-d-don-don't
Or should I walk out instead?
Is this +Live or Let Die+ or +Night of the Living Dead+? (dead, dead, dead)
