[Babyface Fensta]
Who I? Face Fensta, ill like syphillis
Sick like herpes simplex
Just imagine, you took a plunge like arena
Let off shots in your back, like that padlock on the train
Shit is real, Babylon shoot to kill a nigga
Like Tyesha from California, now we boxed it
Military killing, clothed up, invincibility
Shattered, dagger in your heart, it skips a beat
As this belief clouds your judgement
It's in your suspect, lightly checks the bounce
I got to have bounce on a winner
Yo, I'm Rolling Stone, so Kiss my Judas Priest
Like The Police, I'll be watching you
Justice for all, just ask Metallica
Used to love Battlestar Galactica, and Buck Rogers
In the 21st Century, yo the aliens is out to get me

[Chorus 2X: Babyface Fensta]
Judgement day, hell night, at the crossroads
Armageddon, apocalypse now, the omen, must defeat Damien

[Babyface Fensta]
Poison scorpion, roll with a
Lion from Zion, touch the dome then
Vinyl perfect platinum, my creation's perfection
Respect my manner, or like Dr. Banner, you wouldn't like me when I'm angry
Your credit be locust, from my less than bogus stature
My skills are sharpen daggers, you ain't worthy to battle me
You crabs, be a black man, learn the originality
Spittle your rebuttle, with a riddle me this, riddle me that
Or hit with a twist, escape the matrix
A scientist, just wait til I master all my elements
If I gotta be celibate to stay alive, then so be it

[Chorus 4X]</pre>
