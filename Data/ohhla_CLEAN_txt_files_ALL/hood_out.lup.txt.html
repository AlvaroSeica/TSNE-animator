[Lupe Fiasco]
This one's for the hood!

What do you do when it's so unequal?
Wear Michael Jordan's with your tuxedos, it's hood now, it's hood now
Yea, yea, it's "hood" now
Public school system only teaching parts
So the school of hard knocks is what make you street smart
You're hood now, hood now
Yeah, yeah, hood now
Open fire hydrant 'front the liquor store
Coolin perm ads all on the billboards
You in the hood now, you in the hood now
That's right
You in the hood now
Ramen noodle soups, you make the best
Water in the milk to make it stretch
That's the hood now, that's the hood now
That's the hood now, that's the hood now
Ivy League was running really well then
They slipped up and let Cornel in, it's hood now, it's hood now
Yes it is, it's hood now
In Miami Beach, it's rich white folks
But Memorial Day, "you know who" do the most, it's hood now, it's hood now, it's hood now
Yea, it's hood now
And house shoes is for the house fool
The homies wear 'em out, how cool, it's hood now, it's hood now
That's hood now
Oh yea, that's hood now
And that Mercedes Benz, on them giant rims
Open up the trunk and see 'bout twenty ten's
That's hood now, it's hood now
That's hood now
Oh yea, that's hood now
And diamond chains was for kings and queens
But since we got to 'em they'll never be the same
They hood now
They hood now
Bling, Bling, it's hood now
You pissed her off, you broke the rules
Her earrings out, she taking off her shoes, it's hood now, it's hood now
It's about to be...
Really hood now
Chop up Jazz, loop up the Rock
Sample the Blues, call it Hip-Hop, it's hood now, it's hood now
Yea mayne, it's hood now

[Chorus]
We took that hurt, made it into songs
God bless the child that's got his own
Sayin it's hood now
Sayin it's hood now

[Lupe Fiasco]
Pants saggin right off my ass
I sit it down, right in first class, it's hood now, it's hood now
Yes sir, it's hood now
Fancy restaurant, dress code
T-shirt, gym shorts, it's hood now, it's hood now
Hallelujah, it's hood now
Fashion shows, with fancy clothes
You see Mr. West right in the front row, it's hood now, it's hood now
That's what it means, it's hood now
At the Oscar's, P on the sticks
And the winner is ... Three-6, it's hood now, it's hood now
Uh oh... it's hood now

[Chorus]
We took that hurt, made it into songs
God bless the child that's got his own
Sayin it's hood now
Sayin it's hood now

[Verse 3]
You had Elvis Presley and he was crackin'
But guess what? Here comes Michael Jackson, it's hood now, it's hood now
That's right, it's hood now
Pro sports, them was yo' courts
But you let us in, so on and so forth, it's hood now, it's hood now
Uh huh, it's hood now
They gave us scraps, some of it old
We cooked it up and called it "soul"
It's good now
It's good now
You like that?, it's hood now
And you know me, I don't vote
But the White House, you already know, it's hood now, it's hood now
Yes sir, it's hood now

[Chorus]
We took that hurt, made it into songs
God bless the child that's got his own
Sayin it's hood now
Sayin it's hood now
Yea

[Outro]
You know I had to do it
Can't forget where you came from
One for the ghetto
Two for the hood
Three for the all
Four for the good
Yeah
And we out
This the great
I mean, God is Great
