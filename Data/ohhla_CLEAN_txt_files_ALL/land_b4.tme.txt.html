Dark, dismal and black
Over ran with the wack
No creativity or innovation
Radio worshipped like nativity 
Void of creation
No pens, not enough patience 
Nothing thought out, punch lines bitten
In school yards, lunch line freestyles actually written
Battles drowned in vulgarity and yo mama jokes 
Before time, no messages with clarity to entertain folks
Past descendants a parody of ill 
The future destiny soaks
Fanatics stalk idles with invisible cloaks 
Miserable scriptures 
Freedom attained from liberal mixtures
Framed these paintings, hip hop's realism
Abstract thoughts paint the picture 
Lands filled with thieves, bandits and ignorant emcees
Those who gave up on faith demanded god for a sign
Low patience and high hopes leads to an unbearable climb

Ive saw men living my dreams
Accomplishing goals and acting out visions Ive seen
Ive saw men living my dreams 
Ive saw my guardian angel scream
Ive saw suicide victims sing 
Ive saw peasants become queens
And idiots become kings 
Ive saw puppets walk with man 
And humans with strings 
Ive saw oceans of bodies 
Blue grass and skies green
Ive seen tears
And blood filled streams 
Ive saw hate 

Youll see a father walk on water before he talks to his daughter
Speak without speaking
And witness a genocide without slaughter
A holocaust of emotions
Hollow but lost 
Five gears, no breaks happily coasting 
Perfection is no limitations, eating and never feeling full
Flying high on other dimensions with Jonathan Livingston seagull
Just believe 
Why should I? If its something I cant see
I took a chance to be free
Leaped off the cliff and hit an invisible platform
Grinned at spaceships who left pastures of flat corn
Went back in time, pushed Lincoln out the way merely leaving his hat torn
I thought time was linear but hawking said it was an arrow 
Bulls-eye hit for the future leaving behind retro kid games
Whys there monkeys in barrels?
But what happens when the bows device strikes the sparrow 
Humans were too busy killing over colors and mocking the bird 
You could sprint in my shoes but walking a day is absurd 
Throw your skillets in the air
Let the non believers see a flying saucer 
Cant bury these tales 
Burn the plagued bodies dying with Chaucer 
Ghosts, walk towards the light
Crying in front of a lamp post 

Making music is just a bunch of stress
People want to use you to help themselves
Televisions Uncle Sams brainwash kit 
I hate everyone (I hate everyone)
I used to like to do shows 
But now I dont seem to fit 
I laugh when people tell me Im good Im used to patronizes and their bullshit

I cant sleep the laughter keeps me awake 
I drift off but started by a child's subtle shake 
No one there but myself in this foreign land to witness
And there's no pill for my home sickness 
You need eyes to sleep but you dont need legs to leap
Before you jump off that mountain
Count your blessings a flick a coin into that fountain 

Ive saw men living my dreams
Accomplishing goals and acting out visions Ive seen
Ive saw men living my dreams 
Ive saw my guardian angel scream
Ive saw suicide victims sing 
Ive peasants become queens
And idiots become kings 
Ive saw puppets walk with man 
And humans with strings 
Ive saw oceans of bodies 
Blue grass and skies green
Ive saw tears
And blood filled streams 
Ive saw hate 

In the land before time 
Theres no seconds, minutes or hours 
Just the present clerics cower
Hypnotic therapy clinics booked 
To cleanse the minds of the foresights of the apocalyptic meteor showers
Prophets forecast a poetical being with a vampire's reflection 
Time, conceived not from Immaculate Conception 
But from the absence of a condom's protection 
Men tell women to wash their clothes and make them food 
Then when the time comes 
You wonder why they have a headache and not in the mood 
I fly biplanes and land with no insects crushed on my windshield 
And by the way, the customer's not always right 
In fact they lie to steal 
Far from divine and far from sacred 
Time searches for pens strips them of their ink and leaves them naked 
I piss yellow and bleed red 
Never seen anywhere cause Im always walking in the mist 
Citizens notice four horses but didnt sense apocalypse
Too many emcees got the dough but not the chocolate chips 
I fathered all my words, while false poets used adoption 
Populace poisoned from the tap waters toxins 
I grabbed a microphone and received more strength then a dozen oxen
Destroyed demo ep's so terrible that on ebay 
Even your cousin couldnt auction 
The shepherd hit me 
I laughed and turned the other cheek 
Later that evening I returned and burned his flock of sheep 
Now he's staring in the mirror infested with insomnia 
Nothing to count in order to sleep 

Perhaps, again if my lungs collapse
I pray that hopefully
When I cant breathe you all choke for me x2</pre>
