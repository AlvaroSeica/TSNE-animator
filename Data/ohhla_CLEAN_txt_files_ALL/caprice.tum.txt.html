Song:   Caprice Musik
Typed by: Lil Hustle

[Hook - 2x]
Candy dripping, on a Cheve
Caprice classic, already
I do the fool, watch me clown
This is that Caprice music, it goes down

[Tum Tum]
So fly, not a rink
Hop up in the Cheve, work the wood like my sink
Dipping, and swerving
Me and Loc, you heard me
Spinning, through the Grove
Cocked up, on 24's
Heavy on the neck, you know me
So many chains, I'm bout to O.G.
350, what it is
I see your whip, a lil' advice get big
I be stunting, on that ass
Screens, pop up out the dash
Beep beep
Who got the keys, to the Caprice
450 engine, is a beast
Pull up pull bout twenty five freaks, I play for keeps

[Hook - 2x]

[Tum Tum]
Television wood wheel, sun roof pushed back
Take boys to school, on these slabs I'm a class act
One bopper two bopper, three bopper four
Walk up to the Cheve, when I let up the door
Sipping and smoking, gotta pass that
Take five puffs, then I pass it right back
Noise my protected, T-B-G's up
5-3 B-I-G, d-d-d-d-double up
The gang's all here, leather on the chair
Ain't nobody flossing like this, I swear
Presidential tint, bang in the trunk
Pistols everywhere, got me fucked up
Nip dropped the beat, I laced the track
I'm a fool with it fool with it, like Twisted Black
Whip game vicious, my car look delicious
So much candy on the car, it's re-god damn-diculous

[Hook - 2x]

One bopper two bopper, three bopper four
One bopper two bopper, three bopper four</pre>
