[Chester Bennington]
Together we made it
We made it even though we had our backs up against the wall

[Busta Rhymes]
See a nigga survived the worst, but my life is glorious (huh!)
Better know that I leaped every hurdle and I'm so victorious (huh!)
Take a look, I'm a symbol of greatness now call a nigga Morpheus (yeah)
As force securin the win, better believe I'm so notorious (yeah)
You know that I've been 'bout my bread even though we rappin now (and yes)
We used to live on the strip even though a nigga higher level trappin now (oh!)
Superceded every one of my little struggles and (huh!)
Failure has never ever been an option (trust)
A nigga paper long like rush hour traffic 
and I'm about to take the hood shoppin; get it!

[Chorus: Chester Bennington] + (Busta Rhymes)
Together we made it (you see we did it niggaz!)
We made it even though we had our backs up against the wall (c'mon)
Forever we waited {ha ha!}
And they told us we were never gonna get it
But we took it on the road (to the riches) on the road (to the ghetto)
On the rooooad (and the projects to this bangin instrumental)
On the road (ride with me) on the road (we come to get it)
On the rooooad (yeah, yeah, yeah!)

[Mike Shinoda]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yo
When it all got started we were steadily just gettin rejected
And it seemed like nothin we could do would ever get us respected
At best we were stressed, at the worst they probably said we're pathetic
Had all the pieces to that puzzle, just the way to connect it
I was fightin through every rhyme, tightenin up every line
Never restin the question if I was out of my mind
It finally came time to do it or let it die
So we put the chips on the table and told 'em to let it ride
Sing it, yeah!

[Chorus]

[Busta Rhymes]
Look, in case you misunderstand exactly what I'm buildin
Shit that I could leave for my children's (children's) children's (children)
Now on my wake up I smile, to see how far I've come (yeah)
Fightin for sales on a strip, to I gained the hustle from (yeah)
From nights in jail on a bench, usin my muscles son (yeah)
To countin money like Dre and Jimmy and Russell was (yeah nigga)
But now I live when I dream, you see we finally did it (ohh!)
Let's make a toast to the hustle regardless how you get it
Sing it!

[Chorus]</pre>
