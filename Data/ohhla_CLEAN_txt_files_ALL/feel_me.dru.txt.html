   Yeyah..
   Comin straight from that izno...
   A.K....
   No play...
   Matta fact...
   Listen to my... baby.
   
   Can you feel me?
   I said I'm doin' what I gotta do, stayin' true to tha crew.
   Can you feel me?
   I said I'm deep down and dirty, I grew up hella early.
   Can you feel me?
   I said I fantasize about tha dreams, havin' big fancy things.
   Can you feel me?
   I can still remember when I stole my first diamond ring.
   
   O.K., I'm deep down and dirty, you heard me before, but I'm a kick
   this shit like I be kickin' in some front doors. Now popo or five O.,
   straight on that real, always been real, fifteen blocks down tha
   street from that feel. But still see niggas have got it wrong, that
   popo is five O., and that is my hoe. Come and see me some time, bust a
   (rim?) and bust a rhyme, after that I fucked that (rimmy?), bust a
   rhyme and get a dime. And lets smoke, choke, until the break of dusk,
   fuck that bitch dawn, and put that penny in my palm. Understand this,
   I roles deep in tha five, I've been down with tha five, I gets dirty
   in tha five. And do a hoo ride. Why? That is tha question, devils be
   guessin', don't question, stressin'. Livin' in tha ghetto, hello, you
   betta hear me, and if ya don't you betta really try to feel me...

   Momma always told me it'd be days like this. So I took myself to
   traders and bought myself a fo (fip/hip/hit?). And some clips, shit
   was gettin' hectic, check this niggas try to wrecka, bets and etc...
   And I bet ya ya life has never been a taken like, I'm deep down and
   dirty early. But see pearly, at tha age of three, took my ass DMV
   cause my momma was deceased. I still ended up a with tha gangsta
   comin' from tha street, talkin' mentality, causin' casualties, don't
   be mad at me. I'm D.D., pimp playa O.G., born up in tha city of tha
   O.A.K.L.A.N.D., ghetto brown hustla, no sucka, serious about my
   bussiness. What is this?, now dig this, I overnite became rich. I'm
   me, not tha ordinary nigga from tha street, grew up, threw up, to what
   I wanted to be, and what I sing...

   It didn't matta my money was gettin' low, I'm on tha struggle,
   whatever a nigga go fo, he gots me on tha double. But solo, cause
   niggas be bitches and snitches at tha same time, but I'm a go and get
   my nine. And find these niggas who be talkin' a hell of a lot a to
   these bitches, these bitches who be talkin' a hell of a lot a to these
   niggas who be riggas, but I'm a go and hit and do a diggum smack, a to
   your ass back to tha future. Smoke super, I'm rollin' in tha six eight
   Couger, while Reugers I masta mind like Lex Luger. It ain't no thang,
   like a chicken wing, with tha (mob/wild?) fo from (ozco?), our mission
   is never impossible. Not fo me see, so fuck that O. series, you stuck
   on that screen I laugh, I'm over mescaline. Aha ha ha.... I see a
   dream as a triple beam, with hella dough from a mutha fucka, with no
   cut bro...
