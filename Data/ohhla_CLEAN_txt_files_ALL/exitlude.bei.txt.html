Song:   (Exitlude) The Jokes On U
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

You creep through the back door
Around 4 A.M. and straight to the shower, you go
What's up, washing your hair now of unfamiliar scents
And I bet you believe, I don't know
I tell you that you smell so sweet
And then you climb on top of me

You thinking to yourself that you did it all so well
Kinda feels like deja vu, no one deserves me more, than you
Then I turn to the window and laugh, cause the jokes on you
Cause the jokes on you (haha) the jokes on you
Cause while you were washing your hair, she was here
But the jokes on you (haha) the jokes on you
When it's all said and done your not the only one</pre>
