Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Wish I could turn my whole town into a strip club
I'd invite everybody
Wish I could turn my whole town into a strip club
And have all those women round me

Diamond peaches from Memphis
Jay blaze be an A stand
My girl Dior, she don't dance no more
But se cool as fuck cause she stay down
I should send the G5 to DC
Fill it up with them girls form the stadium
Cause D town like British
And I'm, sure it's some shit she can say to him
You got reds, got Alicia,
Caliente Trisha
And I don't think I know her stage name
But the bitch so bad you might kiss her
What about that A town
Mad city, OG
I spent so many hundreds

Wish I could turn my whole town into a strip club
I'd invite everybody
Wish I could turn my whole town into a strip club
And have all those women round me

Women rabi and KOD
She'd be climbing up that pole
Plus the ass so slow
Can't forget just Britney
I seen her naked spit 60
But he still ain't getting that number
Even he says, you gonna hit me
You don't buy bags, they don't buy furs
They just stack they money high
They all got houses in the Berg
Can't forget ya
Even though we'd be beefing
But Imma get bout 20 racks
Spending on this weekend

Wish I could turn my whole town into a strip club
I'd invite everybody
Wish I could turn my whole town into a strip club
And have all those women round me

Damn I miss that jazzy things
Damn I miss that naked
I was 17 at the blue flame
Up in the gentleman's club getting tipsy
Damn I miss white chocolate
Anybody seen Sugar?
If I was having money back then
Swear to God I'd have took her
Nah nah, I'm in a dream
I see them town bitch in the feam
I hit boy toy when I was 20
She told a young nigga
Whole lot of things
Made a nigga wanna get rich
And on night like this
I sit in my hotel room
And I reminisce

Wish I could turn my whole town into a strip club
I'd invite everybody
Wish I could turn my whole town into a strip club
And have all those women round me</pre>
