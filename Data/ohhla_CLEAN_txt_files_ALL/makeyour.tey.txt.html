Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Wale]
I'm just tryna keep you flyer than you've ever been
And you the illest bitch alive, I'm a represent
And I could do without your pride, cause it do alot with mine.
If I'm that much on your mind you should catch a jet
Look, pardon me do, have an um â never mind
Them other bums, couldn't see me with seven eyes
Forever my dress code is soverignized
If you not an angel then tell whoever in heaven lied

Blasphemy, You are the only thing running getting cash from me
And you worst than the money cause you glad for free
As she throw it back, I know you've been practicing
Haaaaa look, double M genius
Fortified up a couple bucks worth of sneakers
Trying to find a sister like a sister of Venus
She deserves bars on feeling misdemeanor
No need to fret girl you see that I'm the best
G.O.O.D double MG Connect
Leggings &amp; sneakers she say she don't need no
Heels for the evening
She turning her freak up, her freak out
Money talk shout out them up town things with that funny walk
More clown, bubble post, she forever dope
Go Harlem, it's time to start the show

[Teyana Taylor]
Ohhh Ah Ah
I can't sweat him
He's got the best of me
I gotta get him
Ohhh Ahhhh

Gotta forget him
He's got a hold on me
I gotta get him
Ohhhh

[Chorus]
Tonight, I just can't deny you tonight (tonight tonight)
I can't shake the feeling inside (inside inside)
Feel it when I look in your eyes (that I)

Gotta make that move
Aye
Now baby tell me that groove

Ohhh noooooo

Make that move
Uh
Now baby tell me that groove
Hey

Might just let him
Take control of me
I gotta get him
Ohhh yeaaaah

I might just sweat him
Make a hold on me
I gotta get him
Ohhhh Ooooo

[Chorus]
Tonight, I just can't deny you tonight (tonight tonight)
I can't shake the feeling inside (inside inside)
Feel it when I look in your eyes (your eyes your eyes)

Gotta make that move
Oh yeah
Baby tell me that groove
Ohhh nooooo
Move
Oooo oooo
Boy I'm looking at you

[Bridge]
Boy I will never let you know
(Never let you know that I can see)
The feeling that you give to me
(It makes me quiver)

Baby no you make me weak
(And I know that you just want my heart I swear to you)
So baby won't you come with me

Boy you like just what you see
(I will never let you know that I can see)
Come on and just make that move
Baby I would be with you
(But I think that you just want my heart I swear to you
I gotta stay on the prowl)

[Chorus]
Tonight, I just can't deny you tonight (tonight tonight)
I can't shake the feeling inside (inside inside)
Feel it when I look in you eyes (that I)

Gotta make that move</pre>
