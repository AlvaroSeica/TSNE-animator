[Intro: Flavor Flav]
The Lion of Juda, keeps twenty six lions
The main great lions are like the ?? thugs
The way they layin' around the palaces of Ethiopia

[Bob Marley]
The Black survivors
The Black survivors
Here we go ----------&gt; Chuck D
How can you be sittin' there
Tellin' me that you care?!
That you here?
When every time I look around
The people suffer in the sufferin'
In everyway, in everywhere
Aiyh, na-na-na-na-na

[Chorus: Bob Marley X4]
The Black survivors

I Gotta gets Mine ----------&gt; Chuck D

[Bob Marley]
I tell you what: 
Some people got everythin'
Some people got nothin'
Some people got hopes and dreams
Some people got ways and means
Na-na-na-na-na

Here we go ----------&gt; Chuck D

[Chorus: Bob Marley X4]
The Black survivors

I Gotta gets Mine ----------&gt; Chuck D

[Bob Marley]
So I adorn, I cistern
The preachin' and talkin' is done
We've gotta live up, woh now, woh now! 
Cause the Saga time has come.
Some people put the best outside
Some people keep the best inside
Some people can't stand up strong
Some people won't live for long
Na-na-na-na-na

Here we go ----------&gt; Chuck D

[Chorus: Bob Marley X4]
The Black survivors
I Gotta gets Mine ----------&gt; Chuck D

[Chuck D]
Strong with it, Strong up
Strong with it, Strong up
Strong with it, Strong up
Strong with it, Strong up
Where no more intelligents
Time to save the continents
Power words to the people
Buster stay in conflict
Cause the people sold they people that used to be equal
The same old story goes sequel
Shoot out, we're all must think as one
But the conflict lied, unless we're all get some
Gold, Silver and Diomands that we're all mindin'
Got to get mines, we got to get mines

[Chorus: Bob Marley til fade]
The Black survivors

I Gotta gets Mine ----------&gt; Chuck D</pre>
