[Chorus]
Bump bump, we run up in the club and rock this
Bump bump, we turnin dancefloors to moshpits
Bump bump, Hykoo man the cockpit
Bump bump, get ready for the blast off kid
Bump bump, we run up in the club and rock this
Bump bump, we turning dancefloors to moshpits
Bump bump, Hykoo man the cockpit
Bump bump, get ready for the blast off kid

[Bridge]
Bump, bump, bump, bump, bump
Bump, bump, bump, bump, bump

[Verse One]
I bounce in a bar with a thousand models
Bump through the door and break the bouncers bottle
Excuse me, I just wanna peep one song
If you let me in the lounge Imma get my bump on
Bumpin along to local club rappers
Dumb crackers need to learn to lift they bump factor
Nup, I aint really feelin his set
We bump beats, he look like he bump internet threads
We independent, we gets love from bitches
We put our name on trains not bumper stickers
Im twisted, I got trees to blaze
Then Imma Bump Bump Bump like B-2-K

[Chorus]
Bump bump, we run up in the club and rock this
Bump bump, we turnin dancefloors to moshpits
Bump bump, Hykoo man the cockpit
Bump bump, get ready for the blast off kid
Bump bump, we run up in the club and rock this
Bump bump, we turning dancefloors to moshpits
Bump bump, Hykoo man the cockpit
Bump bump, get ready for the blast off kid

[Verse Two]
I drink bub when Im in the club
My names Hykoo but you can call me Mr Bump
I boogie to the tune the DJ bumps
Than I bump into an ex I havent seen for months
Damn girl, whats new hun?
Your skin so smooth that it give me goose bumps
I buy the broad booze then we bump and grind
I touch her thighs, a twinkle in her luscious eyes
I take her to the toilet for some sweet love
In the industry macks call that a speed bump
Back to the bar for another pot
Fill me up, I'm not a player I just bump alot

[Chorus]
Bump bump, we run up in the club and rock this
Bump bump, we turnin dancefloors to moshpits
Bump bump, Hykoo man the cockpit
Bump bump, get ready for the blast off kid
Bump bump, we run up in the club and rock this
Bump bump, we turning dancefloors to moshpits
Bump bump, Hykoo man the cockpit
Bump bump, get ready for the blast off kid

[Verse Three]
Bump it up, I can never get drunk enough
Bumpin off the walls like a broken bumper car
Bumpin tough, looking for people to fight me
Bump into a thug and spill my drink on his Nikes
Watch yourself, like you got real brains
You bumpin heads with a drunk who dont feel pain
I steal chains when I bump into guys
Sell it back to them, catch me bump up the price
Now I'm slurring like a country bumpkin
Its like I'm in a sperm bank, I'm fuckin nothing
Bumping home having trouble with sight
I'm ghost, I'm the thing that goes bump in the night

[Outro]
Yes sire, we come correct yo
MC Mo Mo, longside Hykoo

Drop it down eva like, ev eva like, eva like
Yo, Getti getti eh eh aye aye
Whoa, right right</pre>
