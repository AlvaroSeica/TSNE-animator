Typed by: AZ Lyrics

From my fingertips to my unique double helix
From my fingertips
From my fingertips to my unique double helix
From my fingertips
From my fingertips to my unique double helix

[Eso]
Yeah, Check it out yo yo
Yo your one of a kind like the sun when it shines
Impossibles possible they cant fuck with my mind
I know it cuts like a knife when they throw down on your game
But keep that fire brewing till that house is in flames yeah
So I hope your open to the view that theres millions on this planet but noone can be you
Creative control, I write what I wanna say
And this must be a dream job my life is a holiday
Yo I'm happy rappin at this creek that I'm fishin in
Cause the mainstreams known to eat the fisherman
The big buck corrupts the sweet and innocent
So we drop it till it knocks em out the seat their sittin in
And we keep deliverin the talent that balances this
Equilibrium like we need deliverin
So these days everybody wants their wrist blingin
I lost faith until I heard the kids singin

[Bliss]
I just launched of the highest cliff free as can be
Gravitys gone baby this between me and my dream
And the limit ain't the sky so I'm higher than a pilot
See the vision and aspire to the fire in my iris
Damn right every kid is unique
We're all the missing puzzle piece that makes the picture complete
We all march to our hearts and its signature beat
Noone can walk in your shoes and leave the prints from your feet
From my celestial body, internal astrology
My atoms dance like stars in a circular odessy
This is my universe with iradaptile libro
Elevating my perspective as I'm peering out the window
With my eyes on this ride at the vividist carnival
So let your pride fly you the original article
Travel with that as you step over the earth and see
Your life is like a song that can echo an eternity
Lets write this

From my fingertips to my unique double helix
From my fingertips to my unique double helix
From my fingertips to my unique double helix</pre>
