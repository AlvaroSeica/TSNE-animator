[Intro]
Here we go again!
Uh uhh, uh uhh

[Random]
All is peaceful in the city, and things are back to normal
16 months have passed, the last situation 'til I
turned on the news for my daily information
Then they told me 'bout a new danger the city is facing to beat
He said there's some kind of robot flu
And I ain't talkin 'bout the kind that make you go ah-CHOO~!
This is a lot more lethal, cause every 'bot infected
is exhibiting behavior that's a lot more evil
Attackin the people, no reasonable reason
Guess it's time to get equipped cause I'll be leavin this evening
On a, mission more dangerous than any before it
I can't ignore it, can't forfeit, so I just go towards it
Towards a fate I can't run from, protecting our loved ones
Gotta figure out where it comes from
If I ain't no better, I would think it's Wily
And Rush barks in agreement while standin right beside me
And I was thinkin this is getting old
And then the flu bug infected my sister Roll
And now it's serious, cause once again it's hittin home
We gotta bounce, hop on the Rush Jet, let's hit the road
Here we go again

[Chorus]
Here we go again, I can not let the enemy win
I got to fight until the end, use all the strength I've got within
I hold my head up to the clouds, then I turn my music loud
Came too far without a doubt, I can NOT turn back now

[Outro]
Here we go again!</pre>
