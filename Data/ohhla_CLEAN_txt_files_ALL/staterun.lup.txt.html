[Intro - Matt Mahaffey]
You must be, a radio station
And who are we? We must be
A number one song, spinnin all day long
And over again, and over again, and over again, and over again, and over again
And we know when, when we call in
And nothing's free, sounds to me like
State run (radio), state run (radio), state run (radio), state run (radio)
State run (radio), state run (radio), state run (radio), state run radio

[Verse 1 - Lupe Fiasco]
We interrupt this broadcast
To bring you this special message about the forecast
The future's cloudy and it's rainin on the poor class
Road to peace is closed, heavy traffic on the war paths
Love is ballin on a budget, the military's says it's gon' need more cash
To keep fightin for your gas
Keep us in our hoods and hope we never explore past, stay inside of your half
Believe the lies you learned in your class
That there's no treasure in your trash
And the ceiling has the same feeling that the floor has
And that's where you should stay
This is what they play

[Chorus - Matt Mahaffey]
Over again, and over again, and over again, and over again, and over again
And we know when, when we call in
And nothing's free, sounds to me like
State run (radio), state run (radio), state run (radio), state run (radio)
State run (radio), state run (radio), state run (radio), state run radio

[Verse 2 - Lupe Fiasco]
You're now tuned into the weakest, frequency of fear
Keep you locked right here
And hope you never leave this, never be a leader
Think inside the box and follow all procedures
Never ever believe that, you will never need this
Hit up all your friends and tell 'em to repeat this
"Hi, you're on the air, now what you want to hear?
Well we ain't got the truth but how about a remix?"
Different is never good, good is only what we pick
You ain't got a hit, unless it sounds like these did
Not too smart, you will be a superstar
And if you dumb or something, maybe you could be number one

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - Lupe Fiasco]
So beware what's on the airwaves
And be more aware of what's not gettin airplay
Independent spirits, you can barely hear what they're sayin
Truth ain't gettin on like shampoo on an airplane
Propaganda's everywhere, constantly on replay
All the hits, all the time, back to back on relay
Where really where it lives, make 'em hear the records we play
Build your own station, become your own DJ

[Break - Matt Mahaffey]
You must be, a radio station
And who are we? We must be
A number one song, spinnin all day long
And you put me, in daily rotation
You're on the air, we know you're scared
But we don't care, we'll play this here

[Outro - Matt Mahaffey]
Over again, and over again, and over again, and over again, and over again
And we know when, when we call in
And nothing's free, sounds to me like
State run (radio), state run (radio), state run (radio), state run (radio)
State run (radio), state run (radio), state run (radio), state run radio
State run (radio), state run (radio), state run (radio), state run (radio)
State run (radio), state run (radio), state run (radio), state run radio</pre>
