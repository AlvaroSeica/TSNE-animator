[Chorus: Rubbabandz]
Aiyo ya'll shorties wanna bounce wit me, come on, and bounce wit me
Get ya lungs dirty, burn an ounce wit me
Run through the town wit me, we can run the city like Diddy
Ball through the mall, ain't life pretty?
Them diamonds look good around your neck
I bet it feel good cashing daddy check
I bet ya arms hurt holding all them bags
Ride or die wit me, this is how it's gonna be

[Rubbabandz]
Listen, my jewels glisten heavy, I whip a black Chevy
I said I'd be there at 8, and bitch better be ready
Cuz putting ya weave on, and cake on your face
Ain't really necessary
The general is very, impatient, in every
I need a chick hair done like Macy Gray
Wit a bone in her nose, and her nickname Kizzy
She jumped in the whip and said bump a little Biggie
She whipped out my dick and said don't be stingy
I'mma suck it til the zebras come home, my niggy
I said, I'mma turn you into a overnight celebrity
I'mma take you on a ten thousand dollar shopping spree
You can get a lot from me, if you play your cards right
But you ain't getting no dick tonight
But your brain is superb, that's my word, I'm riding
And swerving and almost banged the curb

[Chorus]

[Rubbabandz]
Yeah, listen, my whip shine heavy
22 inch grown men, she so ready
Somebody claw my paint like Freddy, haters
When I catch 'em, I'mma send them to the cemetary
I know it was that bitch ass bitch, I got caught up in the mix
She found the tape, home made flicks
And this is what I get tricking chicks?
This is what I get tricking out of town tricks?
Why she think she my girl, it might of been that cruise
That we took around the world, it might of been that booze
That we drunk til we url, then I said you my girl
I didn't think she'd take it to heart, and now
I got a tear world apart, take back everything
I gave her ass, and she ain't get nothing back
But smart remarks, I put her in the game
And that's living out of shopping cart

[Chorus]

[Rubbabandz]
Ride wit me, shorty shorty, I know you bout it bout it
I'm just chilling, I ain't trying to get rowdy
Where it's not overcrowded, bitch what you thought?
You in the big city, New York, New York
I got hoes of all sorts, different flavors of the week
They call my phones, I don't pick up, they don't speak
That's that childish shit, grow up, bitch, you weak
I need some time to my self, sometimes I need peace
And they never overstand where I'm coming from
Cancel that hoe, like Nino Brown said, 'bitch, I get another one'
I got about a truck load, a couple of tons
All types of area codes, and I ain't the one
Ya'll better recognize a don when ya'll see one
Black mack chasing one broad, my money too long
So I don't have to chase ya'll hoes, I can play
Freeze tag, all this ice I got on</pre>
