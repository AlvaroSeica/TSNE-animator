[Intro - Akrobatik - talking]
Ha (ha)
We gonna fuck y'all head up with this one (head up with this one)
Yeah (yeah)
Perceptionists crew (Perceptionists crew)
Beantown got my back (got my back)
So let's fuckin do it (let's fuckin do it)

Yeah c'mon, c'mon
Let's go, yo

[Verse 1 - Akrobatik]
Pump your fists like you won the World Series
For the brother that be causin your analysis in theories
Y'all to near me not to hear me
If it's a beat that's errie, then you know you in store for somethin ser-ious (word up)
I burn mics period, leave 'em in flames
One of the only names consistent in the game 
in the last decade, to remain prominent (yeah)
Sold out shows on multiple continents (woo)
From Boston to Australia, got sisters singing like Mahalia Jackson, live action
Fuck with Akrobatik and you endin up in traction (what?)
I don't start shit but brother fear my reaction (yeah)
Been around the world more than Crazy Legs' backspins
I got it done, while you at home high, relaxin
Workaholic, about to become a murkaholic
You easy to fool, fans think these jerks are brolic?

[Chorus - Akrobatik]
Y'all people need to (step it up, up, up)
Bum rappers y'all need to (step it up, up, up)
Lame promoters niggaz (step it up, up, up)
Don't ever try to test my rep kid, what (what?)

[Break - Akrobatik]
Make your moves and get your dough
And count your money and rip the show
And get some rest and rock some more
and make your calls and hit your flow

[Cuts by DJ Jayceeoh of "step it up!" repeated several times behind Break]

[Verse 2 - Akrobatik]
Yo, this ain't no "Sports Rap Up," it's brute force rap, what
They say a rapper's only as good as his last cut
So I make sure they all knock (all knock)
From my brain, to the lab, to the store that it's pumped on y'all block (y'all block)
These other niggaz couldn't be weaker
I make 'em obsolete soon as my voice hit the speaker
They need to step their rap game up
Cause they whack lame fucks, fuckin it's up, even they names suck (woo)
But Akrobatik sets new standards
I'm too candid (what?), programmed to do damage
Attitude is similar to Bruce Banner's
Usually laid back, but piss me off and I'm a loose cannon (uh)
I make Babylon fall with a "yes y'all"
If that don't work, niggaz could brawl and

[Chorus - Akrobatik]
If we do, you better (step it up, up, up)
Radio, they need to (step it up, up, up)
Bum rappers, y'all need to (step it up, up, up) 
Yeah, don't ever try to test my rep kid, what

[Break - Akrobatik]
Make your moves and get your dough
And count your money but rip the shows
And get some rest and rock some more
and make they calls and hit your flow (flow)

[Cuts by DJ Jayceeoh of "step it up!" repeated several times behind Break]

[Verse 3 - Akrobatik]
Fools wanna know if I'm known in my hood
Stupid, does a bear shit in the woods?
And wipe his ass with a furry white rabbit?
I'm the biggest thing to come out of Boston since "I Got To Have It"
Next to Akrobatik you sound average
It's like comparin sour diesel to old cabbage
So come on my tour, carry my baggage
Stand at the side of the stage and see the total package

[Chorus - Akrobatik]
And go home and (step it up, up, up)
Tell your whack friends to (step it up, up, up)
Bum rappers y'all need to (step it up, up, up)
Don't ever try to test my rep kid, what

Yeah, yeah, yeah</pre>
