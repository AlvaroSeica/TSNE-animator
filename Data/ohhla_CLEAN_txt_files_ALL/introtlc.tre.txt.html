[Trey Songz]
Ay what's crackin baby
It's your boy Trey Songz
Live and di-rect with my homeboy
You know who it is
The untouchable R&amp;B mixtape king DJ Finesse
What's happening? We was in the club last night
poppin bottles gettin drunk fuckin with a couple ladies
You know what it is baby but now I'm talkin to you
Look "Trey Day" drop June 12th and look
I'm gon' give you a lil preview on how I'm feelin music
You know the rappin thing
It might take time to get used to
but nicely so play with see what y'all think about it
Finesse let's drop somethin freaky </pre>
