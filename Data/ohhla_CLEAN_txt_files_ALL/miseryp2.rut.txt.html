If you ain't ready for what you're about to hear, cover ya fuckin' ears!
Kayslay and Megatron
This is what the streets been waitin' on!
Too Raw for Radio, featuring Ruthless Bastardz
(It's the Bastardz) Staten Island is back!

[Chorus: Apocalipps]
Aiyo, I've been through the misery, walked through the pain
And our hunger's unexplainable, we all the same
The table's turned, now every hood bounce to my hits
And you said I wouldn't amount to shit, I'm just a Bastard
I've been through the misery, walked through the pain
Our hunger's unexplainable, we all the same
The table's turned, now every hood bounce to my hits
And you said I wouldn't amount to shit, I'm just a Bastard

[Iron Mic]
Aiyo, lemme explain to you niggaz, what we all about
Yo, where my Ruthless soldiers? We out here? No doubt
Nigga, we straight from the slums, straight from the crack house
And we've got plenty of guns, nigga, don't act out
See, I'm a Bastard child, my daddy backed out
Look, he got killed out in my hood, so now my gat's out
It's like I'm on the block, seekin' revenge
People's tellin' me "Leave that shit alone", I wasn't even ten
But, it left me scarred for life
Now I walk around with a gun or a knife, you better guard ya ice
I know them clothes and them cars and them jewels look nice
But don't come 'round here at night, nigga, we uptight
And, we gotta sling that white to buy them things we like
Come on, and notify our sons and daughters to dress nice
Better watch out for the fiends, the D's in the blue and white
You gamblin' when you scramblin', nigga, fold them dice
Nothin' but head cracks and crackheads
Sellin ' VCR's and shit, anythin' to get that bread
Where I live we starvin' like you wouldn't believe
The wild life got me robbin' just to feed my seed
You know what I'm involved in, gimme the bread and the cheese
And you could have that meat, nigga, I'm just tryin' to eat

[Chorus]

[Apocalipps]
Now I'ma take you through our lifestyle, our wild decisions
If it's ya first time here, kid, well welcome to prison
My name's Apocalipps, but to my peers I'm like a mentor
Forget that, lemme tell y'all cats what I'm in for
Five hundred beans, that's right, five hundred beans
A five-to-ten for five hundred beans, as wild as it seems
I was the type of cat that go and rob you with the toaster
And that there brought me a first class trip to Alster (County)
Shackled up, sayin' everything's gon' be alright
But Officer, you gotta have these handcuffs so tight?
Damn, mama said there'll be days like this
Where I'll be payin' for my actions, that's the way life is
But I just suck it in, you know, swallow my pride
And you could learn from my mistakes, so just follow my stride
I could blame it on the judge or try to blame police
Matter of fact, it was my hood, so I'ma blame the streets
Don't try to blame nobody else, kid, blame yaself
You sold ya life to the state for petty fame and wealth
You used to run with a crew but now you by yaself
And ain't no bear hugs and pounds as ya cry for help
And watch yaself, cuz you could get stabbed and cut
Or booty bandits up in the cut plottin' to stab ya butt
And it's a dirty game, and things'll never be the same
A number's my name, my whole life's infected with pain
I'm miss my babies, I miss my girl, I miss my mother
And when you see my sister, please tell her that I love her
I'm tongue is like gasoline, you could burn from it
And spit my life for one reason, that's so you could learn from it

[Chorus]

[Truck]
Yeah, I remember the day like it was clear, the whole year
No heat or hot water, moms and pops never there
Got my ass sent up, up there with child welfare
Now I'm caught up in the system called foster care
Considered a loser, man, I lost my sanity
Always stayed a loner, the black sheep of the family
My third grade teacher, tried to harm my life (So what did you do?)
So I backed his ass down with an army knife
Now I'm kicked outta school, man, that ain't right
So I never went back, I guess I'm a fool, right?
It was no joke, livin' with all kind of folks
Kinda felt like Arnold when in Different Strokes
The Facts of Life, I never had no Good Times
I had to rob and steal to survive, thank God I could rhyme
I'm starvin', tryin' to reach my quota
My refridgerator empty, the only thing in that bitch is bakin' soda
So I used that there to get my cake in order
The grand and the China White, it'll take ya over

[Chorus]</pre>
