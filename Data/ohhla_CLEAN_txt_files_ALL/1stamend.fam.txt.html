[Intro: Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. sample]
There is a danger of silence today
Which unintentionally encourages evil to flourish
Was Albert Einstein was right when he said,
The world is in greater peril from those who tolerate evil
Than from those who actively commit it.
Did not President Kennedy warn that those who do nothing
Are inviting shame as well as violence?

[Shawn Wigs]
Son, it's my choice to talk, that super fly thang
Rudy Raymore, Dolemite type slang
1st Amendment, freedom to talk, independent
Spend ten boxes of ziti on the pendant
Chain and watch, talking that Scotch with the Arma'
Escalades out, Soprano style at the barber
Caesared up, tennis ball style, I move major
We can talk on the phone, face-to-face, two way pager
I'm a chatter box, slay my freedom of speech
Talk til I teach what I know, free at last

[Molly-Q]
An hour of speech, half Dr. King, half Kennedy
Free telerates, we congegrate
Rainbow, we mash in the threshold of rap
White and black attack on the map, the bare facts
React, color why, masked of mind, lost times
Do's and don'ts, thin lines, crooked crimes
Break up our rights, the fam, together we stand
Right off the storm of the Devil's weather man
Constitution, government pollution
Salute the O.T.F., battlist on some bullshit

[Interlude: Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. sample]
When all of God's children, black men and white men
Join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual,
"Free at last!  Free at last! Thank God Almighty, we are free at last!"

[Crunch Lo]
I'm the two-G Mega Evers, heavy with cheddar
Buttersoft leathers, bulletproof feathers
Too much chocolate deluxe, behead the Ku Klux
Free my mind, hoes down and get my G's up
We tough talk, walk the walk, like the Green Mile
Cruncha Beneen, muscle team from Staten Isle
With the interacial babies, linos and jimmies
White House, made, made to herbally pennies
Dutch scud missiles, Elian Gonzalez
All over America, B.I.G. like Chris Wallace
Mix races, now we taking over spaces
Rewrite the pictures, God's wonderful creations

[Lounge Lo]
Now it's a first time for every thing, my first pose
First lick, first punch in the nose
First shot going through my clothes, fiends coming first
Plaques sold, the first time that I snatched gold
Inside the building lobby, pardon me mommy
Shit is rough, you know that robbing was a main hobby
It was live from the 1-6-Ooh, I seen my first fight
The first time that I made potty, a little kid always cried for poppy
And I shouted, that I did it cocky
Freedom of speech, so the first I speak
Mayor Guiliani, fuck you, I got a whole team that wanna touch you
Ain't nothing changed about my nigga Kase
Corrupt cops need to get shot in they face
Dr. Martin always spoke on us, the first time
That the whites tried to hold the bust, first time
I was placed in cuffs, up in the Bronx for the God U Nuff
Ya'll cats ain't fucking us, first time for a street brawl
First time for a "lou-lou-lou", move with tough, sound it out in street core
First time that I seen action, it was way before the movie Jackson
It was way before the movie Jackson...

[Outro: Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. sample]
America must not become a nation of onlookers
America must not remain silent
Not merely black America,but all of America
It must speak up and act, from the President down to the humblest of us
And not for the sake of the Negro, for the sake of the image...</pre>
