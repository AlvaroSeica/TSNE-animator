{*25 seconds of a concert slowly fading to open*}

You rollin? YOU ROLLIN?!

[Intro]
Yeah here I is again, that's me
And there's you, and I dig all you cats out there
talkin up that fine juice, and pattin each other on the back
And tellin each other, who the greatest cat in the world is
Cause they gon' get it STRAIGHT~!
If they can't straighten it, they know a cat that knows a cat
that's gon' get it straight, well I'm gonna put a cat on you
Yeah

[J Dilla]
J Dilla, Madlib collab'
Take cats in the back in the lab
(Yeah, c'mon, niggaz, bankroll out)
(Uhh, pop somethin, smoke somethin, drink somethin, huh!)
J Dilla, Madlib collab'
Take cats in the back in the lab
And dangerous with pens and pads
I don't even really need to ad-lib the rap
Better fix your traps, or you'll get sah-lapped
By a nigga in a Piston cap
Detroit players, pimps and macks here
We live this, you whack, then it's a wrap
And niggaz ain't with that distant crap
So don't spit it, I spit back tit for tat
And please don't twist the facts, I'm back in this
To shut down the game, to switch it Jack
Then shake shit up, twist the cap
Now I'm all over the place, get the picture snap
Y'all better beware m'uhfuckers
And y'all better prepare for da rawkus

[Interlude]
Yeah, you know how a nigga brang it
Yo, it's veterans up in this muh'fucker
Yeah, so what, let's get loud
Drink somethin, feel it y'all
C'MON!!

[J Dilla]
J Dilla, Madlib collab'
Take cats in the back in the lab
Heavy like Chevys, and built to last
You ain't built to last, you will collapse
Shoulda did your math, get ready to feel the wrath
When Dill' and Lib attack
Better come real with that, nigga chill the yappin
What you rap ain't filled with facts
If it ain't real don't deal with that
Here to shut down the game and still I'm mad
With the rough-ass brillo pad shit
Live on it when I fire I will react
We out tryin to fill our fists with scratch
So after you get the dick, get the picture snap
Y'all better beware m'uhfuckers
And y'all better prepare for da rawkus

[Outro]
Where the party at, c'mon
Push 'em up, yeah
It's all on us, yeah
Y'all free tonight, how y'all feelin
Pull up in the club and show somethin
Show some love tonight yeah
Let me see that bankroll c'mon y'all
Spend some money yeah, y'all know what this is
Uh-huh! We mummied out, yeah</pre>
