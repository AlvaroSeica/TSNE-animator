[Valure]
Somebody put the juke joint on, listen to the words of the song
let me prove what I say is true, that I'm realy really feelin you

[verse #1]

[Eddie]
hey, hey, hey shorty why you here standing alone?
do you need a little company? can I help you find your way home

[Gabrielle]
do you wanna talk to me? I don't need no lines boy
what you got to say to me I'm sure I heard of many times before

[Joshua]
you got that sparkle in your eyes that a guy just can't miss
or your cinnamon tone, girl, I can't resist

[Gabrielle]
I hear you, baby, listen to this
you got to win all my affection, if you want to sample my kiss

[chorus]

[Joshua]
Somebody put the juke joint on, listen to the words of the song
let me prove what I say is true, that I'm realy really feelin you

[Gabrielle]
I'm sure you do, want to get to know me better

[Joshua]
i want to hold you all night long

[Gabrielle]
you can play whatever

[Ron]
somebody put the juke joint on (somebody put the juke joint on)
somebody put the juke joint on (somebody put the juke joint on)

[verse #2]

[Gabrielle]
suddenly I find myselfslowly falling
something about you makes me wanna give your love a try

[Eddie]
come and hang with me, girl

[Gabrielle]
maybe I could stay for a while

[Eddie]
closer baby dance with me, wanna feel you next to me I

[Ron]
put a quarter in the jukebox, the music not the issues
she really digging your style that offical
and I've been tryna tell you, man, she want your attention
but ain't tryna hear me now, now she playing hard to get
your ex-girl friend still be calling your phone
tell me what's it gonna take for her to realize this
this is love at first sight, kid, open eyes
remember one thing in life true love won't lie

[chorus]

[Gabrielle]
Somebody put the juke joint on
I wanna hear the words to my song

[Joshua]
let me prove what I say is true, that I'm realy really feelin you

[Gabrielle]
I'm sure you do wanna get to know you better

[Joshua]
I wanna hold you all night long

[Gabrielle]

[Ron]
somebody put the juke joint on (somebody put the juke joint on)
somebody put the juke joint on (somebody put the juke joint on)

[Marya]
cosa loca, con sabor. vamo arriba bilador. siente el aire esta caliente
es el juego del amor, de caricias y pasion; este fuego esta ardiente
sienta la musica!

[chorus]

[Joshua]
Somebody put the juke joint on, listen to the words of the song
let me prove what I say is true, that I'm realy really feelin you

[Gabrielle]
I'm sure you do wanna get to know you better

[Joshua]

[Gabrielle]
