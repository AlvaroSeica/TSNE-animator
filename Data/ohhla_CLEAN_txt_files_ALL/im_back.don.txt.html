I'm back Thug Life baby

[Chorus]
Guess who's back

Rick Ross talkin' facts like Tupac back
Ima gun till I die ain't no body can stop me you
Nigga gettin' to fly but y'all lyric is sloppy, so tell me

Guess who's back
Guess who's back
Rick Ross talkin' facts like Tupac back
Ima gun till I die ain't no body can stop me you
Nigga gettin' to fly but y'all lyric is sloppy

[Verse 1]
Y'all need to picture me rollin' look all the green
That I'm holdin' my enemies start chokin'
Because my pockets is swollen my momma told
Me to watch it because these coward be plottin'
Equipped with automatic weapons guess you bastards forgoteen
My killer teen with marble heart like killers in prison yard
Eat why you can because you punks is about to starve
Ain't no tellin' and fellas don't make without sellin
In cage I do wellin will all my rage is yellin
I'm so addictec to gettin' lifted
I'm twisted in swisser sweats perfected the game label me
MVP I be screamin' that thug life cause I knoww they don't like it
Preapeare my army for battle in watxh me trigger a riot but now

[Chorus]
Guess who's back
Guess who's back
Rick Ross talkin' facts like Tupac back
Ima gun till I die ain't no body can stop me you
Nigga gettin' to fly but y'all lyric is sloppy, so tell me

Guess who's back
Guess who's back
Rick Ross talkin' facts like Tupac back
Ima gun till I die ain't no body can stop me you
Nigga gettin' to fly but y'all lyric is sloppy

[Verse 2]
I went from rag to riches to world wide livin'
I hit the baddest bitches when I left prison
Educated by drug dealin' was playin' for keeps
Destroyin' you nigga cariers every time when I sleep
I ran with nigga with red lasses and red bandana
All my homies confare casses with grass and hen
Forgive father I'm trouble she respectin' my hustle
It wasn't easy believe me I went trough the struggle
My evesseries is bury my girlfriend's worry
I started another rage of gun fight lost in the furry
Initiated an oucast I ride when shots blast
Sippin' on some hennessey pourin' on big glass
Theese chickens be assed outh the reason I cashed out
They be wantin' relations so meet me up in the glasshouse
Goin' to fuck with the dead so ima eat like zombie
Guys took shots at my head but now you nigga can't find me but now

[Chorus]
Guess who's back
Guess who's back
Rick Ross talkin' facts like Tupac back
Ima gun till I die ain't no body can stop me you
Nigga gettin' to fly but y'all lyric is sloppy, so tell me

Guess who's back
Guess who's back
Rick Ross talkin' facts like Tupac back
Ima gun till I die ain't no body can stop me you
Nigga gettin' to fly but y'all lyric is sloppy</pre>
