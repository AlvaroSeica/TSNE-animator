Ha, Edinburgh city, Its Werd S.O.S.
Shout out to Riddlah the UVBeat maker

Jump start the track mate
(Drive it like its fucking stolen)

I want to hear this pumping in your motor, Auld Reekie
(Drive it like its fucking stolen)

Turn this one fucking up mate
(Drive it like its fucking stolen)
(Drive it like its fucking stolen)

Drive it like its fucking stolen
Pump they tunes with the windows open
Run round town with the system dropping
Drive it like its fucking stolen [x2]

Shift, put your foot to the floor
Now shift, OK rev some more
Now shift, put your foot to the floor
Now shift, mate we move up a gear [x2]

(Yeah) I want to see everyone, fucking bouncing
Drive it like its fucking stolen

Drive it like its fucking stolen
Pump they tunes with the windows open
Run round town with the system dropping
Drive it like its fucking stolen [x2]

So swift, yeah car I got it
And I drive just like I stole it
Splif, in my mouth I toke it
Pigs, bacon, fuck the police
Im strickly tipsy fuck the bizzys
We just smoke like chimneys
Drive around and hand out the window
Jump right out if your acting silly

Drive it like its fucking stolen [x2]

You hear the exhaust? sounds like a Porsh
Im cutting him off, oh shit man Im off

Drive it like its fucking stolen
Pump they tunes with the windows open
Run round town with the system dropping
Drive it like its fucking stolen [x2]

Shift, put your foot to the floor
Now shift, OK rev some more
Now shift, put your foot to the floor
Now shift, mate we move up a gear [x2]

Yes, fucking Auld Reekie, to Glasgow
Drive it like its fucking stolen
Fucking Scotland mate,
Drive that like its fucking stolen

Drive it like its fucking stolen [x2]</pre>
