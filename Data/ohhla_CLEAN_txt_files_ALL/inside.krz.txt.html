Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro]
Do exactly what I tell you to
Drop on the floor
Close the door
My hour

[Chorus]
I wanna love you from the inside, inside
And we can get closer and closer
Love me on the outside, outside
And we'll do it over and over

[Verse 1]
When you move
It's almost violent Â– her attitude
Ooh
And when you breathe
It's like you're breathing life into me
Me...

I can't lie
If I had to choose the way that I die
I die...
I'm inside
If I could stay here forever I'd try
But I

[Chorus]
I wanna love you from the inside, inside
And we can get closer and closer
Love me on the outside, outside
And we'll do it over and over

[Verse 2]
This can't get better
'Cause every move I make makes you...
Can I say that?
And I never
Let anyone this close but I let her

I can't lie
It feels so good right now I could die
It's true
It's in my mind
Because I never touched you
But I'd like to

[Chorus]
I wanna love you from the inside, inside
And we can get closer and closer
Love me on the outside, outside
And we'll do it over and over</pre>
