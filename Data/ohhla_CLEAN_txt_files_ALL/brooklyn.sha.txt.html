[Sha Stimuli - Intro]
(Ohhhhh-whoa, ohhhhh-whoa, ohhhhh-whoa) Brooklyn stand up!
(Ohhhhh-whoa, ohhhhh-whoa, ohhhhh-whoa) Brooklyn stand up!
(Ohhhhh-whoa-ohhhh... Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Sha Stimuli]
How that shit go? Manhattan keeps on makin it, Bronx keeps creatin it
Queens, I ain't hatin shit, but Brooklyn keeps on takin it
Niggaz can't take it, they askin us +Why?+ like Jadakiss
BK got all your favorites (uh-huh)
I'm from where we hate poverty, so we become state property
Kane, B.I.G., Jay, this is prophecy
Duke, I was born with the mentality, you cannot stop me
From the home of the Mash Out Posse
From Brownsville to Flatbush, Crown Heights, Bushwick, Fort Greene
We push, hard white, good shit, dope fiends
Weed spots, cops, dollar cabs, Kansas Fried
Dirt kickin on Church Ave. where my man just died
My dude in Vanderbilt postin, movin shit up on Newkirk and Nostrand
While I'm outside sippin the potion
Liquor stores on every corner, you can wake up any day and be a goner
Every kid wants to be a rapper or baller, it's so hard

[Chorus]
It's so real where I'm from
It's so hood where I'm from
BK, Brooklyn, stand up! Where I'm from
Niggaz bustin they guns
Cats are stackin they ones
Don't try to front, Brooklyn stand up!
Uh (Where you from...Where I'm from)
(Where Brooklyn at?)

[Sha Stimuli]
Nigga, I'm from where the glocks busts, shots touch you
Niggaz snatchin chains from you and not run
Cops come, ask you, "What your name?"
Try to knock us and lock us, ofr gettin in the game
I know you thinkin all boroughs are the same (uh-uh)
But understand the PJs' and BK will turn hard rocks
Send you cake like the Junior's dessert, I put in my work
See Decepts, Low Lives, Albee Square Mall
where the killers used to stalk like the REAL {?} Hawk
We got areas like the Stuy, it's live in the summer
The fifty states, you could be out in Kansas or Kuwait
And yell, "WHO'S in the house? Where Brooklyn at?!"
Right here where the crooks is at
Every block is a church and we only prayin up in funeral services
God watchin, as a kid I used to boost, I was nervous
For Fulton Street, the Kings Plaza, had to carry poker chips 
and hit the store for moms and get the grocery
This is where I'm from

[Chorus]

[Sha Stimuli]
You know I come from where the hammer is held, the drugs are sold
We trapped in hell, the summer is cold
The block is hot, it's outta control, and ever motherfucker could flow
for BK, where the heat sprays and replays, like DJs'
I flip flows in three ways on one verse for three days
You feel it in your system, niggaz call me The Present
I got now, I get over and I'm a gift, I'm a legend
I'm like Kane, B.I.G., Jay, Fox, Kim, nigga watch 
Stimuli be in the Top 10, somebody stop him</pre>
