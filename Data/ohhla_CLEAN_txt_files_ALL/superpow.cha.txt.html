[Tongue (+ Ozi)]
Yeah yeah, Chasbot turn that beat up man
Louder, louder, (yeah pump it up) louder
(Pump that shit up) (Chasm LP)
(You know what you've been waiting for... It's hereeeee)

[Hook] {X2}
"I got the hi-tech superpowers like the X-Men"
"Bombing on your sound system late nights" --&gt; Fame
"Spit the real"
"Make shit precise and drop bombs in a second"

[Verse 1: Ozi Batla]
Chasm sound the horns of war
These Sin City foot soldiers are bringing it raw
Like hoards of mutants, just to cause a nuisance
We spitting fire - you spit poor excuses
These cats just don't know what a truce is
Fire off your axillary boosters and it still losers
Cos we the prime movers, Chasbot exterminate and crash your computer

[Verse 2: Tongue]
Yeah that's what I'm used to
Free record deals in five years, Ohhh yeah - that's a producer
Chasm old school like Back to the Future
A teacher, a drum-kit munching creacher
The breaks arn't safe when we step in the place
Dusty vinal still vital to our survival
Beats and breaks help to keep us together
A united front from now til whenever

[Hook] {X2}

[Verse 3: Jewson]
When we make lines - it's getting you amped like cocaine
Not late night cabbies that suffer from road rage
Not fussing with gold chains, try topping this? No way
From stopping this bomb shit from dropping in 08
You topping the home-made, flames fresh out the basement
Demonstrating a statement that's generating amazement
It's blatant when gracing the beat from my man Chasm
My speech is a hand-cannon as deep as the Grand Canyon

[Verse 4: Dialectrix]
These people that plan action, collective and complete
Together from the outter-west of the centre of Sydney
Imbedded in histroy, impeccable prestige
And never will cease til we bury this six-feet
The wait is over like the apocolypse came
We rock hotter than flames like moulder rock in the glacier 
Like the Titanic but twice as gigantic
And beats as so deaf we rhyme in sign language
