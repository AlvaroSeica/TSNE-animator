Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Asher Roth]
Yeah
Aiyyo I plotted to rock, yeah Zach De La Roth
Nottz knockin the knock, the nod never gon' stop
Yeah they talkin a lot, but ain't none of its true
When the album is dropped, and then nobody move
Yeah now we're the cops, enforcin the laws
So we get behind bars, a new sheriff in charge
Get arrested for fraud, fake rappers get mauled
Gnawed on, eaten and clawed, beaten in brawl
Nottz riggedy raw, Roth kid is a boss
Gettin bigger than some tits that couldn't fit in the bra
Yeah I'm fittin to crawl, if my legs cut off
Still finish before sprinters by the end of the song
Y'all been gettin me wrong, think I'll never get on
Empathetic with a sentence cause I'm reppin the lawns
Front back, fuck that if you think that I'm soft
Take a skull clean off, sip your brain through a straw
Aww, naw, real dangerous dog
Let Nottz tell 'em all we ain't playin wit'chall

[Nottz]
Yeah; Mr. Roth hold up, heavy as the elephant
Dumbo flow, go oh so nuts
People think I'm heaven sent the way I walk on water
Bitch I spit like yo bitch, cock suck
Fuck you pussy, I'm far from celibate
We hot, you not, but that shit's irrelevant
Thought I'd just mention it, so you won't get the shit
twisted or backwards wit'cho dyslexic ass
You jackass, you jack for ass
I don't give a bitch jack for ass
I'm a hit with the hoes, ya momma know
Knock 'em down like dominoes
Dick game proper tall and slim like Fillmo'
Jam it in the gut 'til they feel mo' pain
Muh'fucker I only use a third of my brain
Therefore kiddo, I'm clinically insane
Every morning hook the jumper cables up and start the brain
Electrify, drink Red Bull and pesticides
and goat milk, tell me dog can you stomach this?
So sick like a kiddie on Christmas
didn't get shit for Christmas but broke shit
I'm far from broke bitch, catch a boat where I'm at
Asher and Nottz, raw fo'sho', real rap y'know?
