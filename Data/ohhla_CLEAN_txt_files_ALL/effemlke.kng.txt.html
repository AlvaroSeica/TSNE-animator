[Intro: King Lil G &amp; Robbs The One]
818 eight one eight - l.a
Robbs the one - king l-i-l g
You know I love you girl
Well not really
But you know I love fuckin you anyway

[Verse 1: Robbs The One]
Bad bitch, fat ass, right tits
Thick thighs, nice eyes, big lips
Good job, good credit, nice whip
Shit, I think I love this bitch
Hey, I think I love this bitch
Naw i'm lying homie
You know I don't love shit
I ain't tryna wife it
I'm just tryna pipe it
So come here girl
And show me how you ride dick
Ride it till the sun sets
Or even cruise the sun set
Yeah make that ass bounce like a bum check
1 step, 2 step, 3 step, 4
You on your period?
It's cool we'll fuck on the floor

[Chorus: Robbs The One]
Hey, I think I love this bitch
Hey, I think I love this bitch
Hey, I think I love this bitch
Naw I'm lying homie
You know I don't love shit
I don't love hoes
And I don't love tricks
I just fuck em like I love em
Make em love this dick
I don't love hoes
And I don't love tricks
I just fuck em like I love em
Make em love this dick

[Verse 2: King Lil G]
Now you know I'm on a mission
I say it all the time
Girl I wanna fuck your sister
I - I - I said this is dirty business
D-9 mob life
Let the crew hit it
I'm far from a medic
Tongue automatic
Nasty motherfucker
Like I'm beto the ratchet
Got your phone number
When your man wasn't looking
You tell him i'm your cousin
When you know we fuckin
I'm not your muthafucken man
Stop tagging me in pictures
Up on instagram
South side
This is what I bleed
I'm a muthafucken legend like tony g
I'm in the west coast
I'm in the west coast
All the bitches wanna kick it
So I tell em let's go
DJ turn it up
Got a party poppin'
So you gotta hit me up

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Robbs The One]
Hello? hello?
It's that freaky fellow
Riding through the ghetto
Looking for a whore to settle
Whip for the night
In my sight I see jello
Shakin' as it walks down the street
In stilettos
Pedal to the metal
Where the spit game mellow
She with it so we did it
She love wood like gepetto
Took her to the motel
Where I make them hoes yell
Now she's sayin' she in love
But I'm like oh well
Shit happens bitch I swear
I don't love you just my dick do
The shit's a player
I got hoes, hoes, hoes
Like ol saint nick
It might have tell you this was love
But no way bitch
Beside you can't believe nothin'
I be saying when we fuckin
I be fronting like a muthafucker
Tryna get a nut in
So much pussy in the world
Yet one dick
How could I ever ever love just one bitch?

[Chorus]

I don't love hoes
And I don't love tricks
I just fuck em like I love em
Make em love this dick
I don't love hoes
And I don't love tricks
I just fuck em like I love em
Make em love this dick
