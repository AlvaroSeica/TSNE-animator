[Chorus One: Game]
I'm tryin to go to CHURCH!
Get some chicken wings, after that hit the strip club
See some hoes TWERK!
See bad girls be at the strip club
Good girls they be in CHURCH!
Always wonder why my grandmother
try to get me to go to CHURCH!
Please Lord forgive me, I'm 'bout to take niggaz to CHURCH!

[Game]
Christian Louboutins, they're my best friends
I'm 'bout to put these bitches to the test then
What you callin spikes? What color that box?
Is it a white bag in it? Yeah? No? Hold up, stop
You ain't 'bout that life ('bout that life) you ain't 'bout that life
You don't bounce that ass like "Oh Lord!"
Then climb back up the pole to meet Christ (Christ)
Saturday night, she twerkin it for a real nigga
These niggaz hatin, I hate them niggaz, make me wanna bring back Tommy Hilfiger
+I'm in Luv Wit a Stripper+ (stripper) cuter than the nigga T-Pain (T-Pain)
Said +I Luv Dem Strippers+ (strippers) word to my nigga 2 Chainz (2 Chainz)
Got a leather Ferrari, Eddie Murphy pants
You strippin? Go on twerk it then, cause after this

[Chorus One]

[Chorus Two: Trey Songz] + (Game)
I know this ain't the first night, go on girl just do your thang
Don't be actin shy, take a sip and just do it babe
I'm sittin here all night, just do it for me
Don't waste no time girl, just do it for me
Girl I pray that, me and you lay down
Come on baby lay down, go on lay down
Sooner or later, sooner or later
The way you move that ass, so innovative
(CHURCH!) Thicker than a Bible
(CHURCH!) I need it for survival
(CHURCH!) Lord, save me!
(CHURCH!) Poppin bands for my baby

[Game]
I'ma crucify that pussy, I'ma nail it here, I'ma nail it there
I'ma mail it here, I'ma mail it there, doin all this sippin Belvedere
Got a sheriff here and the bailiff here, all we missin is a judge
One night with a random bitch and she'll burn your ass like a rug
Real niggaz gon' say that, real niggaz don't play that
Real nigga'll take a basic bitch then close the trunk of that Maybach
Open the trunk to that Maybach, roll the bitch in that water
Conscience start gettin the best of you, gotta pull the hoe out that water
Try to make some sense of it, tell a hoe she got baptized
Put a couple hundreds in her Trues, tell the hoe get her act right
Bands a make her dance, bands a make her dance
Red Bottoms will make her fuck, you broke niggaz don't stand a chance

[Chorus One] - first line starts as "CHURCH!"

[Chorus Two]

[King Chip]
Yeah, King Chip, eastside Cleveland ghetto mogul
You say "Damn, you livin like that?" I say "Bitch, I told you"
Sunday mornin extra clean, get these bitches off of him
I'ma roll through your hood, and collect my offerin
Seen her with a group of friends, damn she got the best butt
Then she turned around lookin like Morris Chestnut
Aww hell no, Goddamn what the fuck? Even though shit a nigga still might fuck
You can be my "Plan C" just in case my "A" and "B" can't cut
Guess what? A nigga so fresh to death I'm decomposin
I just copped a dope ass condo just to keep some hoes in
What I'm gon' do with all these racks? Damn what she gon' do with all that ass?
That baby oil is holy water, ever met a young nigga with too much cash?
Her baby daddy live by my words, damn she cold, she got them curves
Double parked outside of the club, niggaz like "Damn, they got some nerves"
Smokin these L's in the pulpit, with OG Chuck and the cool bitch
Got ten thousand all in ones cause damn that ass is stupid (hahaha!)

[Chorus Two]

(CHURCH!)</pre>
