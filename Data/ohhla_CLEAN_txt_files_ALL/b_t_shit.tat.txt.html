[Bandit]
Check it out homie, check it out
Tattoo Ink, right here in the canton
Check this shit homie, check this shit
Bring it homie, bring it
Soy Bandit

[Conejo]
Isolation, no more childs play
These vatos in the joint on the serio don't play
Got cemetary men in prison gear
Shooting kites about your murder from tier to tier
What you claim? I be the lord of illusions
Got a razor blade smile for the final conclusion
I'm the light, up in Amityville
Smoking yesca, Conejo kills for thrills
Nighty night, execution style
Right behind the ear, threw his ass off the pier
Demon nights, they came to bless my child
In the Harpys Projects where the Tinys go wild
Put it in, this is where life begins
And only real gangsters on the serio can win
Move in on my foe, I got jugo and cora
Ese front a vato off and you get blasted on

[Chorus: Conejo]
These vatos hating hard, you better quit that shit
Hoodrats talking drama, better quit that shit
Fake ballers on the scene, better quit that shit
Before I have to come around and unload a clip
To these killers pulling hits, you better bring that shit
To these bitches moving dope, you better bring that shit
MC's on the mic, you better bring that shit
Gotta bring that shit or just quit that shit

[Venom]
Tell me what you wanna hear de volada out the game
Maintain my cool even when I fucking bang
When I see the juras I play it off real smooth
Smile and wave, now who's looking like a fool?
Plus I have the tools to fix up your grave
There's nowhere to run, might as well give chase
I might let you live but a ranker is a bitch
La neta if you get busted you'll turn into a snitch
Lock it up, roll it up, you're worth twenty five cents
Straight to the cemeterio your soul got sent
Fuck it, your homies remember better that way
He was down for the varrio all the way
You got laid down by one and got carried out by six
Straight up like amalia, this is my deadly fix
Simon it's worth it, to me it is
To die for the Hache, and that's the way it is

[Chorus]

[Bugsy]
Come on now, it's on now
Going all out, homie no doubt
Keep it in order, get dome in a cherry Nova
Sip henny and cherry soda, what is it you carry soldier?
This pen comforts me, nineteen M16's
Stashed through all my residents, any spot can be a murder scene
Like zzz-zzz, hit another switch you see
When all blood is shed we're screaming victory
Show it, demonstrate it, fixed and faded
Confessions of these hitmen got your pussy wet baby
Dog there's no need to wonder why so little is said
Hunger brings out the hustler, we gotta stay fed
Goodfellas, bad habits, filling caskets and automatics
Me, Venom and Rabbit just about had it
Better bring it or quit that, fuck what you say
This T-A-double T-O-O I-N-K

[Chorus]

[Spanks] Hey, whats up girl, what are you gonna do after the club?
[Girl]   I wanna get with you
[Spanks] You wanna fuck, doggystyle?
         Me Love you long time baby
         Better bring that shit
[Girl]   Yeah you know I will
[Spanks] With your big ass
         You wanna fuck</pre>
