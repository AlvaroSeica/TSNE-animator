Yo, a sissy cop in the hood
Shakin a brother down, thinkin he ain't no good
What's your name what you standin here for
Thought I told ya not to come around no more
Man I wasn't doin nuttin why ya fuckin wit me?
Shut up punk don't question authority!
Up against the wall, hands in the air
Just wants the punk to fear
Right about then mo' suckaz came around
Put the young brother into the ground
Hollerin talkin that ignorant bullshit
Grabbin his arm, tryin to break his wrist
A god damn shame and he's only thirteen
Five to one is a pussy's dream
But yo man I ain't goin out like that
Young G to the house and get the gat
Then BOOM BOOM BOOM now shit is equalized
Will when you suckaz realize?
Black people simply ain't havin that
We just hit back</pre>
