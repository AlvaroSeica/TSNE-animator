[Intro: Wiz]
Hm-hm, high school nigga {*inhales*}
And they're tryin to get the smoke outta the booth
But they're not doin a good job
Ohhhh, ohh, ohhh, ohh, oh, ohh

[Wiz Khalifa - singing]
My grades gettin low
But I'm still gettin high
(I might fuck around on some crazy shit right there, keep goin)
It might seem slow
But time's still goin by-e-yyy
... Ay
Oh and I forgot to mention, my girlfriend's trippin
And my homies ain't actin the same, well
As long as there's papers and grinders
I'm takin my time and I'ma roll my weed
(Those are some cool verses)
And take one to the brain-yay-aaaain

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
I keep one rolled, yeah I'm always puffin
Yeah I stay baked cause nigga I love it
Had nothin but now I'm stuntin
Tell 'em roll somethin cause nigga it's nothin
Niggaz gettin mad cause my pocket's swollen
And everywhere I go, yeah, I'm loaded
Had nothin but now I'm stuntin
I tell 'em roll somethin cause nigga it's nothin

[Wiz Khalifa - singing]
Uh, you know my money been kinda funny
But I'm still gettin fly...
And, um, I, don't got the best wheels
But them hoes still jump insi-e-iiide
Yeah, yeah
Oh and I forgot to mention, my best friend's trippin
Me I'm doin all that I can, heyyyy
But long as I stay on my grind
it's gon' be haters, outsiders tryin to take my shine
And that ain't part of the plaaaaaaaaaaan, yeahhhhh

[Chorus]

[Snoop Doog]
I guess if you insist I will
I'm a twister feel, Mr. Feel Good to ya
I got it if you need it and you know I will
And this is after school, so we gon' go until
The janitor, handed her, a pack of that, righteously
She brought it all back to Mac so I'ma do her back to back
Got her fat, bag to pack, posted by the cafeteria
Eatin on a snack, boy I make it crack-a-lack
Days go into my nights, live a young wild life
King of the zoo; Devin what it do?
Knockin all trees down, Dev and Mac with the sack
Rollin up with knees down, baby girl ease down~!
It's a holiday, we smokin pot today
I got a lot to say, I keep it locked away
That's how it is dealin with the pressures of my school life
Livin on the edge, joints to the head - and so the man said

[Chorus]</pre>
