[Lil' Rob]
What's up, ese
Lil' Rob
Simon
Ha ha hun
It's that vato you fools tried to hold back
But it was once said
That you can't keep a good man down
And so I'm back
Ha ha
That's the outcome
Here we go

(Verse 1)
Every morning, I wake up and it's the
Same old way
Just another day, but I still like to play from Saturday
Til Saturday
Some things never change
Lil' Rob
Remains the same
Always
And forever
I've got my mind together
Now a lot better
Tougher than leather
Whether or not
You agree, I'm from S.D. and I won't flee
Gee, what a guy
That's what they say
C-H-I, C-A-N-O
De San Diego
Gotta give my q-vo's to all my primos
Out in Los
Oh so far, but yet
Oh so close
I got you fiendin'
I think you need a dose
Of that shit
That got some of my gente dreamin'
All in my flows
Nobody knows, where it all goes
But I takes it til the end
Final countdown
Ten
Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one
Boom-boom, blowin' up, blowin' up
Is the outcome

Chorus: Lil' Rob
I've got you fiendin' (Fiendin'...)
For the flavor of the
Natural high (Natural high)
Natural high
This, is the outcome
Of me, by my lonesome
I take the beats and lock 'em down like Folsom

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 2)
My life was like a
Puzzle
Searching for the
Pieces
Couldn't find the reasons, now I'm bumpin' for all seasons
Can't nobody stop me
Cause people want me
Hopin' that my wicked past doesn't come
Back and haunt me
No thanks, to the ones who doubt me
Don't know about me
Or
My destiny
But they keep
Testin' me
Thinking that they're stressin' me, but I
Pay them no mind
My time is too expensive to fight young and all defensive
I've learned my lessons
Over the years
Don't pay no attention
To jealous peers
Fear
Keeps them going and going, I've got them fightin'
And they
Know that I'm knowin', and so
I keep on writin' and writin'
But they keep fightin'
To be the very best
I just
Huff and puff, and put that smoke up in my chest
Not, even tryin'
To be number one
But I'm real to myself, so it's already done, and this is the outcome

Repeat Chorus Twice

(Verse 3)
All of a sudden, there was silence
Not a care in the world
No sign of violence
I'm flying high
Just like a pilot
You would be to
If you would try it
I go insane
When I can't find it
My homie sells
That's why I buy it
I roll it up
In a joint and then I light it
It's just the feeling that I have
And I can't fight it
I'm so excited
Delighted
To show these fools
That they ain't got the skills to do it, they're like a mechanic without tools
I got so much to lose, but so much to gain
To end it now
Smoke mary jane, to ease the pain
Who has the last laugh now
People wonderin' how
And so I tell them just like this
"When you're guaranteed to hit, you're guaranteed not to miss"
Not, even trying
To be number one
But what's, done is done
And this is the outcome

Repeat Chorus Twice

[Lil' Rob]
Yeah
And that's how it goes down
Try to hold a man back
He's bound to come back twice as hard
And that's exactly what I did
While you're steppin' on other peoples' toes
Trying to get to where you wanna get
I just sit back and
Huff and puff, and put that smoke up in my chest
Not even trying man
Yeah</pre>
