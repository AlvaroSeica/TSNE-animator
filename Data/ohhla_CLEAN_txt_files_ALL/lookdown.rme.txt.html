Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[repeat throughout] the Lord is watching over me

Fa real
Yo, I believe errybody was put here on this earth for their own reason
And I believe my reason is here
And I'm ready now
I remember when I was at rock bottom
I thought I couldn't get no lower to the ground
I was like damn if I fall anymore, I don't know where I'ma be
But you never know, you gotta try him
You gotta give your all in no matter what you do
And I promise you I don't been though the worst
I done lost my pops
He left.. .. he went to jail when I was young
He back now which is a good thing
But I lost my brother
Boy that was a big deal to me
25-life
2003.. matta fact..that's recent
My sister
She doing 5-10 but I love and respect her
She didn't snitch
She kept it real
And she said "for those that did wrong to her.. wrong come back to y'all"
That's Karma for y'all
I remember when Brandy Norwood hit me in my eye
I had a detached retina my lens came out I had to have 3 eye surgeries
And she thought we'll never be cool again
But I put that on my life
I love her to death
If she hear me talking, I know she can hear the honesty in my voice and my sincerity
But you gotta get up
I know everybody just talking and talking bout what's going on
They don't have a clue
But to get real with y'all
I love dem niggas B2K
But, if it was meant for us to part
So be it
The moral of the story is
When you see me with IMx
And you see me doing my thing
don't mean I don't know bout these streets
Cause I done been through it all
And it all done been through me
All I know
Is God is looking down on me</pre>
