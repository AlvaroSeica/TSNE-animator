[Greg Street]
Yo yo, it's Da Brat, the B-R-A-T
Life After Death, the mixtape
Greg Street in the building
So So Def, ay, let's go!

[Jermaine Dupri - echoing]
This is a, So So Def, world premier
A world, premier
So So Def, world premier

[Jermaine Dupri]
Maybe they don't want it, hoes out on it
And we still party 'round they bitches 6 in the morning
Got my nigga back with me, uhh, kill a track with me
It's that So So Def shizzy Brizzy-tat hit me

[Da Brat]
I got a nine in my pocket, I'm lyin
Got no more time for confinin behind cages ran by cocky caucausians
I'm cockin and aimin, shockin the game and, rockin Jermaine
Remain an unstoppable team, that shit ain't changin

[Jermaine Dupri]
I'm the man but she the pro; doug E. Fresh, she "The Show"
I'm So So, she def, e'rybody know
about the musical molestation that takin place
Fuckin with us ain't safe, we be killin niggaz

[Da Brat]
Murderous conclusions, I ain't never heard of us losin
You must be out yo' mind, delusion-al
to think we ain't gon' do our usu-al
So So, gets it, for years you witnessed it
And you can bet that never had to sweat that, bitches~!

[Miguel]
If you be the cash, I'll be the rubberband
You be the match, I will be your fuse - boom!
Painter baby you could be the muse
I'm the reporter baby you could be the news
Cause if you cigarette, then I'm the smoker
We raise the bet, cause you're the joker
Truth though - you are the chalk
And I could be the blackboard, you can be the talk
And I can be the walk, yeah

[Chorus: Miguel]
Even when the sky comes fallin
Even when the sun don't shine
I got faith in you and I
So put your pretty little hand in mine
Even when we're down to the wire babe
Even when it's do or die
We can do it baby simple and plain
Cause this love is a sure thang

[repeat 4X]
You can bet that, never gotta sweat that

[Miguel]
You could be the lover, I'll be the fighter babe
If I'm the blunt, you could be the lighter babe
Fire it up! Writer baby you could be the quote
If I'm the lyric baby you could be the note - record that!
Saint, I'm a sinner; prize, I'm a winner
And it's you, what can I do to deserve that
Paper baby, I'll be the pen
Say that I'm the one, cause you are a ten
Real and not pretend!

[Chorus]

[Jermaine Dupri]
Wicked and strong, we got it goin on
I'm like, I'm like damn baby
So wicked and strong, and got it goin on
I'm like damn baby

[Miguel] + (J.D.)
This here, between you and I, is simple as pie babe
(Yeah, simple as pie)
Such a sure thing (sure thing) such a sure thing (sure thing)
Such a sure thing (ha ha, la la, la-let's go!)

[Chorus] w/ Dupri talking over it</pre>
