[Intro]
Gangsta
This shit is gangsta
My hood is gangsta
Your shit ain't gangsta (niggaz ain't gangsta)
This shit is gangsta (the definition)
Love wood is gangsta
Your shit ain't gangsta
This shit is gangsta (c'mon motherfuckers ain't gangsta nigga)
Gangsta

[Tha Realest]
The definition of a gangsta nigga
See me in my physical form, when I squeeze my lucky draw
So many lives are in hole
My word is bond
And if you step you best believe my homies are swoll
To put you niggaz in the cemetery (boom)
So many niggaz are dyin' in a hurry but they need not worry
My bullets fly in the flurry shit
Two 40 Glock thrown-ass craze nigga
It's untouchable West/Side Mob niggaz
With the Relativez we got to get the best of them
Bend 'em over watch me fuck 'em like the rest of them
My Temptations got me bangin' for my Thug Nation
Tappin' my phone ?? they listen to my conversation
From Hub City to Brick City we bend out
Picture a nigga drunk drivin' in his glasshouse
With no doubt, I keep clack 'cause it's necessary
I be damn if I gets buried cause I'm a

[Chorus]
Gangsta (a motherfuckin' gangsta nigga)
This shit is gangsta (that's right)
My hood is gangsta (yeah, for sure)
Your shit ain't gangsta
This shit is gangsta (yeah, that's right)
Love wood is gangsta (that's right)
Your shit ain't gangsta
This shit is gangsta (yeah, yeah)
Gangsta

[Big Wy]
We in Darby Park wait room, dip, hittin' the weights
Burn out sex of teen bitches ?? the first place
From the home of gangsterism
Pimpin', bangin' and knock out
Holdin' ?? with red bars sherm the hop house
Mafia
Organize controllin' the scratch
Holdin' the gat
Purpose to put holes in your back
Live by the facts
Leavin' ?? face in the map
And the doctors can't bring you back (flatline)
I keep to driving beneath my feet as I hang in curb
Hang with niggaz with too stripes that bang and serve
Blowin' a herb
Till they conversation is slug
Cookin' the thangs ?? throws and throwin' the bird
Diggin' my stash before the bitches shakin' their ass
Let's them ?breathin'? pimpin' and callin' me daddy
What you have to give it up?
Hell no nigga!
Nigga put it on sum'
On Bloods nigga
Cause I'm a

[Chorus]
Gangsta (nigga)
This shit is gangsta (that's right)
My hood is gangsta (yeah, for sure)
Your shit ain't gangsta
This shit is gangsta (yeah, that's right)
Love wood is gangsta (that's right)
Your shit ain't gangsta
This shit is gangsta (yeah, yeah)
Gangsta

[Suga Buga]
Suga Buga has got trucks and jacks for TVs
White hoes, black bitches, young bitches chinese
Amigos, that turn tricks out of the casino
We know she tear that ass for Suga Buga
Too gangsta too pimpin'
Since the bitch real hookers are from
INGLEWOOD!
So stash the green Coupe
By the iceberg as sooner as you might gon' watch
Oh-Oh
Watch that head up you might get socked
You can't tell me nuthin' about living on the edge
Apartment and buildings where heats and baseheads
Takin' turn servin' smokers in the taxi's ?come?
Can tear up for the police so we swallow and run
I got dubs can sure I'ma sell them
The hood is at war, plus niggaz is tellin'
You better hush niggaz, cause we wild, we rush niggaz
Call out niggaz, go twisted on Expeditions

[Chorus]
Gangsta
This shit is gangsta (that's right)
My hood is gangsta (yeah, for sure)
Your shit ain't gangsta
This shit is gangsta (yeah, that's right)
Love wood is gangsta (that's right)
Your shit ain't gangsta
This shit is gangsta (yeah, yeah)
