[Lil Rob]
Don't stop (Don't stop)
Don't stop (Don't stop)
Don't stop (Don't stop)
Don't stop (Don't stop)
Don't stop (Yo llego, Ese Lil Rob)
Don't stop (Lil Rob)
Don't stop (Simon)
Let's go (Let's go)

(Verse 1)
I am the West, but not Kanye
I drop rhymes like you drop dimes all day
You might see me in the calles, just kickin' back
With my back up against the wall, makin' sure it doesn't fall
And a brown bandanda don't slip
The one that have to empty the banana clip, no shit
Oh shit, Twelve Eighteen just got mean
Walked up on the scene, with my Cortez's, lookin' nice and clean
Bright and white
They ain't right if they ain't laced up tight
Stuffed in my shoe, homeboy, that's just how I do, some
Think I'm hella cool, well, but I'm just a number fool
Who could spit flow
Quick or slow
From the get go, I got more bounce
Than a trapoline
See in the cover of Chicano Rap Magazine
I put it down and I put that on my town, ese
Don't try to clown if you ain't good enough to clown

Chorus 1:
(Lil Rob &amp; Fingazz)
[Lil Rob] Ese
           I'm in (The house tonight)
           Moving your body (From left to right)
           To all you freaks (Don't stop the rock)
           Somebody give it up for Ese Lil Rob
[Both]     Lil Rob's all up in the house tonight
[Lil Rob] Moving your body (From left to right)
           To all you freaks (Don't stop the rock)
[Fingazz]  Don't stop
           Don't really wanna stop (No!)

(Verse 2)
It's kind of
Funny to see how you think you got the best of me
Life goes on, but you vatos are dead to me
Funny all of the time, you invest in me
Don't worry about it, you're not even my enemy
The best will rise and the rest will see
Won't have to say nothing, whatever will be, will be
How many of my people agree with me
Got me laughing so hard, it's fuckin' killin' me
You need to
Open your eyes, holmes, and really see
What it means to be Chicano
How it is to be
I wouldn't helped you out, carnal, and you know that
But you had a big boca, could control that
La vida loca
Hmm
It's not hard to go back
Do what we do, powder blue like my throwback
And go blast
My cuetes spit some so fast
You won't last
I don't tell, so don't ask

Chorus 2:
(Lil Rob &amp; Fingazz)
[Both]     Lil Rob's all up in the house tonight
[Lil Rob] Moving your body (From left to right)
           To all you freaks (Don't stop the rock)
           Somebody give it up for Ese Lil Rob
[Both]     Lil Rob's all up in the house tonight
[Lil Rob] Moving your body (From left to right)
           To all you freaks (Don't stop the rock)
[Fingazz]  Don't stop
           Don't really wanna

[Lil Rob]
Fuck the bullshit

(Verse 3)
We're gonna party and we just don't stop
Bottoms up
On the glass, pop the top off the bottle of
Corona, Henne' cold one
I'm an alcoholic, homeboy
But it takes one to know one
I keep on
Drinkin' til I go numb, rollin' in a low one
Roll one, then I toke on, smokin' til the joint's gone
Spittin' just like poison
I'm a keep on spittin' until my death
Unless you hear my (Voice gone)
I'm the chosen
Flows that are frozen
They cruisin' around this bitch, it time I close in
Orale, what's happenin' (What's happenin')
Back in the place
To packin' the plates, with ass in the face, do a whip it
I'm back in the race and I'm wicked, I'm sick when I twist
Don't get it twisted, I figured you dig it, that mean that you with it
The minute you heard it, the many addicted
My rhymes are terrific, get bad to the bone with the chrome microphone
