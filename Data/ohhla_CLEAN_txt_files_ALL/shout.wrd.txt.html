[Werd]
Shout shout, dont leave a doubt
Smash up the place and throw things about
You wont change a thing by doing that
Rant rave pull out your hair
Turn on the tears I still wont care
You dont move me an inch when you do that

Yo I dont have a girl I know if I did
She couldn't put up with the way that I live
If I dont spit I smoke and I sip
Thats all that is, my music is my life
Its like, my mistress kids and wife
Never acting right we always fight
Were always in a mess
We stress, confess, we mask it with a smile
She could kick off anytime, were just fine, thats denial
In the long run, were just battling through
A few stages in some phases like mazes with moods
So go crazy rip stages, we just misunderstood
And been many places lately through this fighting we do
But if others choose you and I dont like their patter
I've no manners I will tell them right now it dont matter
When youre hyped on that shite and youre acting all hyper
I just sit back and write, I dont care for the drama

Shout shout, dont leave a doubt
Smash up the place and throw things about
You wont change a thing by doing that
Rant rave pull out your hair
Turn on the tears I still wont care
You dont move me an inch when you do that

By now you might call it quits
Is it worth it all the shit we did?
I cant relate to relationships 
See thats what gives when the music is,
My life, no nice, Im sitting in my flat
Watching mice just run about coming from the cracks
Looking for a little scrap, little reason to be feared
Too clever for the traps, guess I got that feeling here
So my idea, would be to stay in my place

Or change for their taste, or see, other
Cultures intertwine through the rhymes in numbers
When a global rap trend gets pushed out further

Shout shout, dont leave a doubt
Smash up the place and throw things about
You wont change a thing by doing that
Rant rave pull out your hair
Turn on the tears I still wont care
You dont move me an inch when you do that [x2]</pre>
