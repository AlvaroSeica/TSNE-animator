[Verse 1]
Daddy's got a new life now
A new daughter and a new male child
A new swagger wid some real style
New car new house brand new spouse
Little shitty dog named Pouts wid smile on his mouth
We'll be straight up we're forgotten cause we developed a plan
Once a month he takes some time to hang with his own fam
Half a day to let ya know he still cares and such
Ya won't grow apart too much from bein' outta touch
But he wasn't there for him on the daily ghetto, yeah the basis
In order to drop jewels I stay clear of the racists
Heavy promises became weightless, sincerity became fakeness
He's praying for his heart to ache less
Time is passin' by yet his scars remain ageless
He called him on the phone to say pop's
This'll take a minute of ya time
But his wishes were divined
By the disenchanted tone at the end of the line, hang up
He tried to look strong in front of mom back up
John stop lookin' forward to the day you gonna see him on
Dry ya eye to eye and you'll receive an embrace
From a lost heart that's pumpin' blood up to a guilty face
He's gonna try to find ways to make up for the last twenty nine days
Or was it thirty, I think he heard me
In situations like this ya speech becomes wordy
He's got a hundred million ways to tell me not to worry
But this time I wasn't hangin' on his every sentence
Ears crippled by the pain and negligence so wasn't game, just
He spoke I couldn't hear a word I zoned into black I observed
My only thoughts were missin' out on love that I deserved
Tryin' to convince myself I'm weak within the mental
The silence breaks because your father's guidance is essential
He's lookin' down with a smile sayin' in the future we'll be great pals
Yeah dad, but what about the now?
Johnny come and leave ya dad alone now
Yeh it's just you and momma now
Stop the cryin' now, just try to smile now
Try to think of other things now
Momma's got another date now
You can get through all the anger and the hate now
Calm down and wipe ya face now
I know it seems to be hard
but I promise you we'll make it through somehow

*scratching* "And now"

[Verse 2]
Little girl their firstborn their sunshine
Never gonna lead her wrong, get it right one time
Here's how it goes, she's off to school an' dancin' on her toes
At an hour long ballet class then on to the piano
Two hours of repetition, emulatin' class with music compositions
Do your homework with precision
By nine-o-clock she collapses in a heat of dizziness
But sleep so tomorrow you'll repeat ya busi-ness
She got straight A's, and spoke of her stress
Brought her maydays but drawn up out the melees
Her mom and dad tryna blame each other different ways she stop and gaze
Thinkin' how it drives her crazy when their voices raised
This dilemma ruins most of her days
From her perfection was expected
and it's hectic workin' hard without receivin' any raise
At night she cries when she lays
Then she wakes up, washes up smiles and goes along like it's okay
On to high school, there's more intensity within her cycle
She's makin' all the guys drool
Here comes the extra tight rules
No mate, not with college on the plate
Practice hard, study hard stay in focus keep ya head straight
Now she's a nervouse wreck, lookin' to collect
Anything that she can smoke swallow drink or inject
When she was mentally gone she went to the prom
Had dates and actually could sit down
discuss relationships with her mom
But tell me how much pressure can a person take
Before they break and maybe crush this on a large enough escape
So one night she turned in but stayed up late
At her desk with a single piece of paper and a papermate
Here's mom before the routine wake at daybreak
What she saw made her knees shake the death of dear Kate
The note said here's the future of your fuckin' perfect child
Please be proud I'm livin' for the now
Do your work, clean your room now
Take the makeup off your face now
Eat your dinner now, get off the phone now
Leave the boys alone now
Saturday night, you stayin' home now
Go to your room and sit alone now
Katie with the needle how
Look baby momma needs you now
Breathe now, God why did this have to be now

*scratching of line*  "And Now!"  (until fade)</pre>
