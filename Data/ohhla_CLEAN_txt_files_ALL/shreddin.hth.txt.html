[Suffa]
As we proceed (as we proceed)
to give you what you need (to give you what you need)
As we proceed (as we proceed)
to give you what you need (to give you what you need)

Check, ay, like we always do about this time, ink lines for the sick rhyme inclined
It's grimy shit, but naught that can't be fixed with a little bit of spit shine
Big time like Frankie in Vegas, inspiring like Ali and Frazier
Spit it out till we spilling onto the streets, start a party up with our neighbours
I'd rather be a part of your playlist than ever be part of the A-list
Harness the energy, heart of a pedigree with the scars of a sadist
I go so hard on the pavement, I go so far with my statements
that I don't know where they end and where I start, it's all part of the game
It's the farthest I've came since I started to play it, I spar with these artists, the heartless and brainless
We're harnessed by chains that are hard to escape, and you change, then they label us bastards or traitors
They're charlatans, they're haters, they start on us, but they're fake as
our parliament, but don't be disheartened by them, pardon their failures
If we don't forgive our enemies, we'll crawl the walls like centipedes
Burn our energy like fossil fuel and fuel our own damn effigy
And we'll all burn like Hennessy, so keep on then and step with me
John Lennon 'Let it Be', dead the beef like abattoirs before these scavengers tear at me

[Chorus 1]
I've been waiting to come back, like where the hell is the show?
Like a balloon on a thumbtack, getting ready to blow
I've been waiting to come back, like where the hell is the show?
Like a balloon on a thumbtack, getting ready to blow

[Suffa]
And it might blow up, but it won't go pop
And it might blow up, but it won't burst
She might grow old, but she won't grow up
Well she might, but only if I go first

She wears her heart on her sleeve like she's wearing a patch on her shoulder
It's not a matter of whether I can catch her, more a matter of whether I can hold her
She thinks out loud she's got me, she laughs with her whole body
I think about how she's got it all figured out, and wonder why she'd even want me
Each night I find it's the same old, when I come inside in the evening
I lie down next to an angel, fall asleep and fly with the demons
They say don't live in the past, and live each day like it was your last
But I'd rather live each moment like it was my first, take it slow and sip from the glass
Savour the moment, spit vicious bars, then pray for opponents, sounds so serious don't it?
But I'm not concerned with a thing, this is book three Tolkien, 'Return of the King'
The kings have arrived, we drink from the sky, we fall from all cause we think we can fly
But our wings have been tied, and the whingeing and lies have me wishing that I could bridge the divide
You living the life? In the blink of an eye the shine of the bling and the rims that you ride
can all disappear, so live for the rhyme, not material things your gift can provide

[Chorus 2]
I've been waiting to come back, like where the hell is the show?
Like a balloon on a thumbtack, getting ready to blow
And I've been waiting to come back, like where the hell is the show?
Like a balloon on a thumbtack, I'm getting ready right now, I'm getting ready

[Suffa]
Since 'State of the Art' we've stayed in the yard, just waiting to start this shit all over
Laying in bars for a day and a half, had to switch from gin to soda
Then by like mid October, record was six months overdue
And I'm like, dude what you expect? I'm only three months sober
Coming up, turning tree trunks over, running up, burning divas, posers
Run amok till the sun is up, or till one of us 'Live la Vida Loca'
I'm going to roll until I fold, like I got a hold of Propofol
So beautiful to know you all, but for now, peace I'm over... and out

Don't wanna go, go
But I gotta go, go, go
I don't wanna go, go
But I gotta go, go, go
I don't wanna go, go (as we proceed)
But I gotta go, go, go (to give you what you need)
I don't wanna go, go (as we proceed)
But I gotta go, go, go (to give you what you need)</pre>
