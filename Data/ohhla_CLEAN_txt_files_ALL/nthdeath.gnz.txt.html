[Young Chris]
Is they with me or against me?
How these pussies gonna convince me to start, and don't follow up
It touch my heart when kids follow us
My mom proud of us, plus I love the green with 'in God we trust'
My mind is stuck, so you don't care about them killin' her
And how could I beef, with them, him or her
You motherfuckers better recognize, everybody got burners
The first that draw, the opposite, the next to die
That's how it go, that ain't just our flow
I still live in the ghetto, as I know
And the hood every day, how y'all dudes good everyday
My momma workin', but the bills take our food, every day
Got to mention our daughter though
Since the ten step, pops, did ten since her water broke
That nigga got like a dub, then did a dime
Came home, left my moms and did another ten

[Chorus: Young Chris]
As I walk through the North of Death
They souls gone but they voices left
They talk to me every chance they get
I gotta make it for the chance they missed
Shit, we all don't get a chance like this, shit
It's hard living homey, more than music
C and Neef, dog, who you got us confused with?
True shit we bout to do it, Neefy don't lose it
Follow the flow homey, like you followed the blueprint

[Young Chris]
I wake up, and ask the lord to forgive us
Til die, put my balls over bitches
But I can't put my balls over business
Cause I hate to go fly when, as soon as I go to trial
need my boy as a witness
Shit I'm just another poor with the riches
Trying to keep my momma cool, give her more while I'm livin'
Rhyming cool, but it ain't what I expected
It's fuck you, if you ain't what they expectin'
They love you when you giving them records
Gotta respect it, just a gift I was blessed with
If y'all ain't impressed with, the shit I do, I'll give it a rest, shit
If I get what the rest get, how can niggaz neglect it
Niggaz respect it, the shit is a method
Lean, 19 giving niggaz broad day and night scenes
Puttin' niggaz on stretchers, my nigga Bean whole team got beams
So you niggaz be wetted, we got pistols forerve
Shit is just getting better, as I

[Chorus]

[Young Chris]
It's funny how bitches used to say he a loser
Now people say he's the future
Now I got to stay in my groove, cause I'd hate to buck around and
And fuck around, it be my face on the news
Momma been through enough of the pain
So I'ma move up, but I ain't moving till I got enough for the gang
Man, these dudes better up up they game
The hood loves us, and it ain't nothing to start from the muscle to gain
Uh, no disrespect, I love my niggaz to death
Cause in the Roc, it ain't about who spit it the best
And plus we way different from rest
You got a show I'm rollin' out
It ain't about who getting the check
I'ma roll it, til the wheels fall off
Keep rollin' or you will fall off
You ain't official, then we'll blist you
Teflon don, extended, both eagles
Back back blocking, pistol poppin', pistol poppin, as I

[Chorus]</pre>
