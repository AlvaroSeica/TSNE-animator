[Intro]
Shhhh, real G's stay low
Real G's stay low, shhhhhh

[Interlude: Crooked I]
Time to get paid, tell me are you down
500 pounds then we send it out of town
Get a big sack, flip that, 'til it's all gone
Watch what you're sayin, speak in codes on the phone

[Crooked I]
Ay, recognize game when you're talkin to a killa
45 a pound, I can hit you with the killa
Call my cousin Sauce when you ready with the scrilla
Got that new bomb shit, silverback gorilla
Wanna taste the product before you buy? I'll bring some
Got a snow bunny bitch, call her Mrs. Green Thumb
Cause all she do is grow weed baby
Bubble kush to that O.G. baby
Threw a couple dollars into a medicinal clinic
Slang illegal weed, we on a mission to get it
Just give it a minute, the Benz'll be kitted
The rims'll be spinnin while the thickest pretty bitches are in it
Hustlers are color-blind, we unite (we unite)
My Mexican connects, always do me right
Got some bad ass chicas you should bring with through the studio
+Half Baked+ in this bitch, you know how the movie go
My iPhone ringin cause business is beautiful
Opportunity knockin so let my nigga through the do'
Yo, snitches thinkin I'm a rookie
I'ma put you in a hole deeper than your momma's pussy

[Chorus: Crooked I]
Shhhh, real G's stay low
Make power moves but don't let nobody know
Send a hundred pounds out of town, watch it go
Keep your mouth shut, if you're snitchin you a ho (you a ho)
Shhhh, real G's stay low
Make power moves but don't let nobody know
Send a hundred pounds out of town, watch it go
Keep your mouth closed, if you snitch you a ho

[Crooked I]
Shhhh, if you snitch you a ho
Cops they be crooked, it's me if you didn't know
They ain't tryin to save the hood by gettin rid of blow
They just want your black ass wearin them prison clothes
They gotta kill me, hope my mother say a prayer
Got a message for the governor and mayor, I'm a hustler and a player
Ask a brother if he care
about the laws you install, middle finger in the air (bitch)
Yeah, fuck the D.A. and the judge
They ain't go up in the PJ with the thugs
Or the C-A where the slugs go (pow!)
Make the noise in the hood
Wanna see a dead body, we some +Boyz N the Hood+
At the BET Awards, naked sleeve retarded
Somebody need work, had to leave when it started
Back then the West was such a dead market
I had to bounce like, "Fuck a red carpet"
I'm a hustler

[Chorus]

[Interlude]

[Outro]
Speak in codes on the phone man, haha
"There will be no prison, which will hold down our movement"
Huey P. Newton
I'm Crooked I, C.O.B. is my religion
Hahaha, yeah, stop snitchin
Ya heard me? Stop snitchin
Lot of you rappers got snitches around you, haha
Lot of you rappers got snitches around you
Why you think rappers keep goin to jail?
Stop snitchin nigga
Shhhh, keep your mouth shut
Shhhh, keep your mouth shut
You know why? Real G's stay low</pre>
