[Intro: Chamillionaire singing]
My toy soldierrrrrr
Call me when it's time to, call me when it's time to playyy
And just tell me where to go, go, go, go

[Chamillionaire]
Said that they was sisters it was Keisha and Amanda
One's a Scorpio, the other said she was a Cancer
One's a bartender, other says she was a dancer
Well I'm the general, introduce me as the commander
What you gettin into? I said "Nothin too substantial"
We just askin you cause we thought you would give an answer
I'm like "Maybe baby but I think I need examples"
That's what we tryin to do but you won't give us both a chance ta
One to take the handle, one to get it damper
Got to be official first you know I got to stamp ya
Come sit on my lap and get a present like I'm Santa
She in all black and climbin on the wood just like a panther
Damn girl~!

[Chorus 2X: Chamillionaire]
My toy soldierrrrrr
Call up when it's time to, call up when it's time to playyy
Heyyy-ay-heyyyy
Just say, I'll, be on my way

[Chamillionaire]
Hold up mayne!
She just sit back and watch her friend do her job then she switches
Feel like Kama Sutra, she massage with deep kisses
My genie is a bottle she say I get three wishes
Well my first is get it wet then clean it up like deep dishes
Knowledge super wet; you can call that brainstormin
Always tell me I'm the best, I confess it's great scrotum
I ain't payin for no sex, y'all get played like Beethoven
Call her up then she collect, you call that pay phone and
I'm like what the hell you mean? She ain't trippin if I choose her
Got a lot of bread, that's why always keep a toaster
Look at these two stripper poles that I got for ya
You and your girl can dance on 'em we can call that bi-polar
Then she turned and asked me what'chu wipin off the desk for
Cause I'm your professor and tonight I'm 'bout to test ya
Ice in her mouth from the cup I left on the dresser
Brain freeze she turned me to +The Nutty Professor+
Tryin to keep composure, sped up like a motor
Her friend behind that line to make her pick just like a voter
Told her take it slower, knew that it was over
when she wrapped around it and she squeezed it like a cobra
Hold up toy soldier

[Chorus]

[Outro: Chamillionaire singing]
Toy soldier!
My, my, toy soldier
When it goes down, toy soldier
It goes do, do, do, do...</pre>
