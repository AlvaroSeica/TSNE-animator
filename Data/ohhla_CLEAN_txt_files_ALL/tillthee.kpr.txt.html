Song:   Til Thee Angels Come (For Us) *Bonus track
Typed by: DaSun Akbar

(Priest talking)
Bad person
In the under world
The bad person or the bad egg or bad news
A bastard a black sheep a black guard
(Get 'em get 'em he's over there)
All the vagabonds thieves

(Chorus)
Look at the things we done
Oh my my my
(The burns)
We live life dangerous...
(The black the cowards)
Just dry your eyes
(The villains the criminals)
Until thee angels come
Oh my my my
(The scoundrels the robbers the racketeers)
For us
And thee angels said
(The underworlds)

Priest:
Look at the killers, dealers, scramblers
Hustlers, pimps, low lives
Are running police coming gunning jumping
Over fences hide in trenches
Fight defenses ducking bullets this that hood shit
Show more footage
Speak from pulpits
(Fellow Americans you are now under a new era)
We all are sinners angels watching
(A new world order)
Ain't no stopping the sky has cracked
You lie back, watch your end, burning skin turning in
Hell bound hell hounds
With scales down to their tails growl wild
Chasing us barking it darkens dropping revolvers in apartments
Here comes the marksman up the staircase
I start busting backwards slipping, Where's the pastor?
Too many distractions
9/11, signs from heaven find a weapon AK SK HKs MK
Mayday mayday mayday
Rocket launchers my project's bonkers
We sold drugs till it's over its time to close up
Yep, lets go - closure
Judgement day thugs must pray
Devils is running 'cause they realize
Something worst than hell is coming
A black bird burning down to the earth
Turning into a fire breathing dragon

(Chorus) x 2

Priest:
It seems like a giant hologram of the president head
Above my projects
Or the night crawling down like a panther
From a tree where the fog sets
Where you hear a whisper out of the darkness like
(Yo yo, 2 for 5, Yo yo come here shorty shorty shorty
Come here come here I got something for you)
Priest beloved immortal travel through portals
Behold the pharaoh before you
I was once a radical poor dude that stood on the corner
Teaching blacks were the lost Jews
Why? 'Cause my people were deprived of Yale and law schools
(Damn) Now they walk around with a head full of lost screws
Never been into rabbit foots or horse shoes
Or superstitions trying to make me lose my vision look up
the nukes are in position

Obadiah aka Ambassador:
Rebuke the system my people are too conditioned too persistent
Many will come but few would listen Razah Priest and Obadiah
A new dimension choose your henchmen
It's crucial business salute attention to the roots and lineage

(Chorus) x 2

Hell Razah:
We surrounded by births, abortions, churches, organs
Don't bury me these Romans will only dig up my coffin
We was orphans who was born in the wars and slave auctions
KKK better pray for the day they burnt them crosses
We the spooks who threw them torches up inside the Bush's office
Wicked forces kiss their daughters and sons and take precaution
Now that Priest released this offering
Renaissance reborn again
My pen drip the ink for the saints
Blood of the sphinx
Kiss my owl on his head
While I feed him unleavened bread
Point the infrared on enemies who wish to see me dead
The Pope opened up and read Revelations then he bled
I met an angel and he said to drop the gun that's on my leg

Priest:
I rolled up out of my bed walked on synagogue floors
My house, cathedral ceilings with Egyptian walls
My dinning room last supper style
Twelve chairs with king Tut cups cave bathrooms and medieval tiles

(Chorus) x 2

Ha ha ha ha
Where you going
You ain't going nowhere
Bring your asses to me
You coming with tonight (hahahahahah)
You coming with me
You did too much to forgive

"And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit
and a great chain in his hand. And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent
which is called the Devil, and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years, And cast him into
the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive
the nations no more, till the end of a thousand years be fulfilled: (Rev. 20:1Â–3 KJV)."</pre>
