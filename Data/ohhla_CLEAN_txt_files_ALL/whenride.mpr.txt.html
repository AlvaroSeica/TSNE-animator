[2Pac Souljah talking]
Outlaw Immortalz
Bow down to somethin greater than yourself trick
Individuals capable of enormous amounts of chin checks and eye swolls
They know
You watchin but you ain't seein what lies before you, beatch
Picture if you will seven deadly human beings
blessed with the gift of speech, the power to reach
each nigga on every street
May the Heavenly Father look down and be proud
of what transpired since the day the seed was planted
The G grew but we knew he'd rise up quick
Smoked out, loc'ed out, all into shit
Just me and my dogs livin like hogs
Outlaw Immortalz
What follows is the story, what proceeded was the glue
What lies between is the fiction
Don't fuck around and make it true

[2Pac]
Hahahahahaha
My adversaries crumble when we rumble it's a catastrophe
I pull revenge on bitch niggaz that blasted me
Plus my alias is Makaveli
A loaded three-fifty-seven with hollow points to a nigga belly
Bust him to see if he bleed, he shoulda never fucked around
with a sick-ass nigga like me
They call my name out and niggaz run, best be prepared
for the Outlawz, here we come
[Yaki Kadafi]

My alias Kadafi, Trump tight so feds can't copy
Six-three and cocky quick to hit your bitch if she drop me
Severely addicted to livin like a fuckin felon
while beefin with rookie cops the cookie rocks a nigga sellin
Since a short I been livin life defiant, nickel plated chrome
Got this baby Capone lookin like a giant, and I ain't lyin
It's like it's me against myself with all these
backstabbin snakes grabbin at my fuckin wealth
(when we ride)
[Mopreme]
Mo Komeni goes terrorist, mad man killer
The bottom of the river where the body lays and shivers
I'm that nigga with the fifty cap pouch, with the murderous stacks
that increase, while these motherfuckers eat beef
It's been a long road, a lot of episodes
And as the glock loads, I gotta teach hoes
Reach hoes, make em feel a nigga when I'm mashin
Now I'm surpassin any assassin
[Chorus: 2Pac]

Thug nigga till we die, no mercy
on these playa hatin bitches, ask me why - when we ride!
Thug nigga till we die, no mercy
on these playa hatin bitches, ask me why - when we ride!
(When we ride)
