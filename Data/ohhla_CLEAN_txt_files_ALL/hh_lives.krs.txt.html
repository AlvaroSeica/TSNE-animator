I come back
Every year I get newer
I'm the dust on the moon
I'm the trash in the sewer
Let's go
I come back
Every year I get brighter
If you thinking Hip Hop is alive hold up your lighter

Let's go
I come back
Every year I'm expanding
Talking to developers
About this city we planning, c'mon!
I come back
Through any endeavor
This is Hip Hop
We gone last forever

Hip means to know
It's a form of intelligence
To be hip is to be up-date and relevant
Hop is a form of movement
You can't just observe a hop
You got to hop up and do it
Hip and Hop is more than music
Hip is the knowledge
Hop is the movement
Hip and Hop is intelligent movement
Or relevant movement
We selling the music
So write this down on your black books and journals
Hip Hop culture is eternal
Run and tell all your friends
An ancient civilization has bee born again
It's a fact

I come back
Every year I'm the Strongest
Krs-one, Marley Marl
Yup we last the longest
Let's go
I come back
Cause I'm not in the physical
I create myself man I live in the spiritual
I come back through the cycles of life
If you been here once you gone be here twice
So I tell you
I come back
Cause you must learn too
Hip Hop culture is eternal

Hip Hop (Shan!)

Her Infinite Power
Helping Oppressed People
We are unique and unequaled

Hip Hop

Holy Integrated People
Having Omnipresent Power
The watchman's in the tower of

Hip Hop

Hydrogen Iodine Phosphorous
Hydrogen Oxygen Phosphorous
That's called

Hip Hop

The response of cosmic consciousness
To our condition as

Hip Hop

We gotta think about the children we bringing up
When Hip and Hop means intelligence springing up
We singing what?

Sickness Hatred Ignorance and Poverty
Or Health Love Awareness and Wealth
Follow me

I come back
Every year I get newer
I'm the dust on the moon
I'm the trash in the sewer
That's right
I come back
Every year I get brighter
If you think Hip Hop is alive hold up your lighter

Let's go
I come back
Every year I'm expanding
Talking to developers
About this city we planning, uhuh!
I come back
Through any endeavor
This Hip Hop
We gone last forever

We will be here forever
We will still be here forever
Get what I'm saying
Forever
Marley!
Repeat
I come back
Every year I get newer
That's That
That's That</pre>
