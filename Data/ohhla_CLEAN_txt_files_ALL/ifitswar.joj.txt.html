[Intro: Lounge Lo]
It's a great world man, word, it's a great world
Great Killa Stapletiller, Staten Island, Pellegrino, is you with me baby

[Chorus 2X: JoJo Pellegrino (Prodigy sample)]
If it's war pull your sons up
Beef, put your guns up
Money, put your funds up
Cake, get your crumbs up
Beats, slow the drums up
Battle, put your ones up
(I rap like noone out there can fuck with me)

[JoJo Pellegrino]
Facing him? You safer using ATM out in Stapleton at Eight PM
I'm sharper than a grey BM
MCs, I pray for them, loose leaks get sprayed with pens
Every paragraph be laced with gems
Lyrical bullets blaze amends, Jo flow rediculous
Subtract these rap cats with complex arithmatics
Aim for the bulls eye, trying to throw darts
Written grenades will knock you out your shoes and both socks
If rhyme was crime, I'd be deep in the system
And I'ma blow like marked targets, put my keys ignitions
Leaving them twitching, enemies I seek and I twist them
Leave them bleeding and spitting in the fetal position
While I walk dogs, dodging cops and devious chickens
My competition listen like I got their fees for a living
Listen, I'm pulling sweet darts out your evilest visions
Biting my recipe, you burn from the heat in the kitchen
In this cold world, hot heads are freezing in prison
So I corse and send a piece to them sticking, cheeks that I'm kissing
Fake thugs play at night out from day slugs
On broad street in broad day, in front of broads that say stuff
I floss ghetto style, half and half, straight mud
You soft in the gut like state puff
I'm from South Shore, outlaw, moving piezones, stay buggin
You get scrapped up steppin without your boots laced up

[Chorus 2X]

[JoJo Pellegrino]
Come on kid, you know this shit's real, cus rhymes equall actual life
I'm naturally nice, taking this game of rap to new heights
You an actor, let's do this shit in front of cameras and lights
And I'ma show you how the boys up on my avenue fight
JoJo flow for MCs who battle with mics
And straight dogs up on the block search your animal rights
Golden skin tone, the parrell is tight
Armed with a tattoo of Christ, you fronting like your attitude's tight
Never mind them cats that shoot dice, I'd rather do heists
Choking your CEO like "Listen, I ain't asking you twice"
You crash dummies better buckle up and fasten up tight
Or catch you a flight, I'm sending Uncle Frank with them kites
I'm laid back, casual type, watch mcs rap about ice
And sell dick cause their album was hype
I'm spitting half of my life, throw darts you couldn't even imagine to write
And I ain't stopping till my capitol's right
Fuck the fame, I want cars, kids, a mansion and wife
I'm low key like the cops when they pass through at night
I made it this far by following my parent's advice
And polishing jewels, seeing big wigs, cherish life

[Interlude: Lounge Lo (Prodigy sample)]
Yeah yeah, whylla beneen, style underneath me
Pellegrino baby, Staten Island baby, South Shore, North Shore, we killing it baby
Do it again

[Chorus 3X]</pre>
