[George Clinton]
Yeah, this is a story of a famous dog
For the dog that chases its tail will be dizzy
These are clapping dogs, rhythmic dogs
Harmonic dogs, house dogs, street dogs
Dog of the world unite - dancin dogs
Yeah, countin dogs, funky dogs
Nasty dogs (Dog)
Atomic dog!!
Atomic dog!!

Life on all fours
when you're out there walking the streets
May compete
Nothin' but the dog in ya

Bow-wow-wow-yippie-yo-yippie-yeah
Bow-wow-yippie-yo-yippie-yeah
Bow-wow-wow-yippie-yo-yippie-yeah
Bow-wow-yippie-yo-yippie-yeah

Life on all fours
when you're out there walking the streets
May compete
Nothin' but the dog in ya

Why must I feel like that?
Oh, why must I!!! CHASE THE CAT

Life on all fours
when you're out there walking the streets
May compete
Nothin' but the dog in ya

Ruff
Ruff
Ruff

[repeat 4X]
Why must I feel like that
Why must I chase the cat
Nothin' but the dog in me

Do the dogcatcher, dogcatcher
Do the dogcatcher
Do the dogcatcher, dogcatcher
Do the dogcatcher

Do the dogcatcher, baby, do the dogcatcher
Ooh

[repeat 2X]
Why must I feel like that
Why must I chase the cat
Nothin' but the dog in me

Bow-wow-yippie-yo-yippie-yeah
Bow-wow-wow-yippie-yo-yippie-yeah
Bow-wow-yippie-yo-yippie-yeah
Just walkin' the dog!
Oh, atomic dog!!

Futuristic bow-wow, ruff
Leader of the pack
Wild dog

[repeat 2X]
Why must I feel like that
Why must I chase the cat
Just the dog in me
Nothin' but the dog in me

Why must I feel like that
Why must I chase the cat
The dog in me (Dog in me)
The dog is in me (Dog in me)

Do the dogcatcher, dogcatcher
Do the dogcatcher
Do you wanna do the dogcatcher
Well, baby, why don't you do it again for me

Dogcatcher, dogcatcher
Do the dogcatcher

House-trained dogs
Wild dogs
Say it again

Why must I feel like that
