Song:   Intro
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

There is an inner beauty about a woman who believes in herself
Who knows she's capable of anything she puts her mind to
And inner beauty in the strength and determination of a woman who follows her own path
And isn't thrown off by obstacles along the way
A woman who's confidence comes from experiences
And knows she can fall, pick herself back up and move on
She is strong when she is weak
But she is brave when she is scared
And she is humble when she is victorious
She is a female boss</pre>
