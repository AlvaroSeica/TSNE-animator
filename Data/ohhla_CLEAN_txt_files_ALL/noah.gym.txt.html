[Travie McCoy]
We like, fuck a hush (shh) on the bus to rush
Actin mad dumb, singin bum-stiggidy-bum(-stiggidy-bum)
Plus we was mad young, I remember actin a fool
We laughin at the monkeys fuckin at the Mat Park Zoo
Yo it was crazy cool, raisin hell at West Street School
Forget what the teacher said, yo we made our own rules
'Member back in the day carvin names in desks
Not even knowingsix years later I would see your death
We was just little kids doing childish shit
'til we got to middle school and got wild and shit
That's when we started chasin girls not even thinkin 'bout grades
We was in a new world, our visions started to fade
We was still homeboys, actin out and such
Even though we didn't hang out as much

[Chorus]
I told myself I'd never cry
I know, I know know why
I never even said goodbye
But now I'm askin myself why
Cause I know, I know know why
I never even said goodbye

[Travie McCoy]
And now we in the high school, smart fish in the lake
we study tryin to keep it real, stayin far from the fake
It's funny how the first month of school started to fly
Before I knew it your life was gone in the blink of an eye
And now I'm stuck in denial, this shit can't be
God tell me why you had to take Noah from me? ...
Why the fuck you had to go and take Noah from me?

[Chorus] - 2X

[Travie McCoy]
School was crazy there the next day, they didn't think I would last
Seein phony bitches try to get the fuck out of class
Now I tried to play hard until I lost my cool
That's when I ran to a stall to shed a tear or two
or three or four, I broke down and cried puddles
Now everytime I see your picture, my anger doubles ...
And everytime I see your picture, my anger doubles

[Chorus] - 2X

[Outro]
Ahh ahh I ahh ahh ahh I</pre>
