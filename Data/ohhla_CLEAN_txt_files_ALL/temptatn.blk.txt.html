Temptation
Emotion
Impulse
Every man's a slave to it

Eye Contact
Conversation
Body Language
Stimulation

She likes me, she likes me,
She keeps callin' me KING it's enticing

Yea YOU found your Queen, I'm the real thing
I'll be YOUR Goddess in the streets, freak in the sheets
Yea, uh huh
Yea, uh huh
Yea, uh huh
Yea, uh huh

If I drop it down, can YOU pick it up?
If I take it too far can YOU bring it back?
Can YOU make me High, when I'm gettin' low?
Can YOU speed it up, can YOU take it slow
Here WE go
Here WE go

It's the chase of it
See I don't want it no more once I get a taste of it, really
It's a game that we're both playin'
YOU want my name and I'm trynna get a Stab at it O.J.'in'
But I already found my Ride or Die, Cookie Johnson
I'm just a man, just lookin' for options
I found my Coretta Scott Mrs. but the plot thickens,
It's Risky Business if I link with YOU and Slide in it

WE Die to Live. WE Live to Die
Time tickin'. Hell or Heaven, She the bomb. (She the bomb)
Will God Damn US for haram harems?
The ticks or her bomb-heaven got the Pauls-barren (Pall[s]bearing)
Coughin' (Coffin) Nailin', even Mary want her (Marijuana)
So High her Highness
But, I can't Promise Landing like the blindest pilot
She so HOT, she be on them Honest Johns like a Bow-tie, YOU don't lay with condoms
YOU might catch a Will of Fortune from a Silent Virus,
That a Witch Doctor couldn't Spell his way up out of
Niggas will learn magic, before they learn from Magic
High off of Temptation, smoke the earth and pass it

Feel free to let YOURself go, Temptations are Everywhere
Reap what YOU sew from High to Low, they Blowing in the Wind
Feel free to let YOURself go, Temptations are Everywhere
Reap what YOU sew from High to Low, they Blowing in the Wind</pre>
