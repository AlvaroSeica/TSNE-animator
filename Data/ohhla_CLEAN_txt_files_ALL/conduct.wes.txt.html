[Maestro]
Move with the Maestro, you feelin hot so 
you set the blend, the crescendo is nice yo
So nice that you wanna sweat when I start to wreck 
Symphony in Effect was just a mic check
You fell for the bait and got decapitated
Dissed and deflated, evaporated
Gone like a dew drop
You try to crush me now here comes a true drop
of rhymes my cultivation
attractin more brothers then Kennedy Station
Resignin I'll refine my lines
and pour the metaphor while the blind decline
I'll swing while my sisters sing for the brother
who's conducting thangs

[Chorus]
conducting thangs 
oh eh ahh

[Maestro]
I wrote a jam called Private Symphony
Now girls are fly to be private nymphs for me 
Lingere neglege and all that
They wanna get on the Maestro love mat
Well I'm single and I won't surrender
So many roni's that want the tender
When it comes to money the Maes don't joke
So don't eff around with my federal notes
I'm live on stage, D's on the fader 
The set is def so my mic's like a lightsaber
Two tigers are always dis 
Even if i had a lisp I'd still sound crisp cause
I'm a brother who's real not fake
and I heard Robert Palmer wants to do a remake, huh
When it comes to rhymes don't steal or take
be original don't duplicate
Cause I'm 5 foot 10 but Big like Ben 
Johnson I'm the black Charles Bronson
Death Wish, Death Wish, Death Wish
I run a dead pool you're number one on my list
So step aside step back step off
I'm gonna tour on your girl now she thinks he's soft
Fresh Wes is sweet like molasses
when I hit the clubs I scoop so many ass...
..istance, no I go solo my brother 
Yeah, word to the mother
I'll swing while my sisters sing
for the brother who's conducting thangs

Chorus

[Maestro]
Because I'm from Canada 
don't think I'm an amateur
cause I'm so fly I'm dropping dope like Panama
Last year I wore a black tuxedo
The chicks paid to see me in my silk black speedos
in my whirlpool or in my jacuzzi
with a uzi on the side the Maes don't snooze
From Toronto with sex appeal
Dark skin with curly hair unlike Curly Neal
I don't play ball cause I can't throw it down
But my rhymes make it sweeter than Sweet Georgia Brown
No beginner but a winner, pass the champagne
Girls be on my jock, they can expect a 12 from my Hanes
I never change, I was made to lay low, you know lie low 
stay cool and drink Milo
and I still chill 
with my homies Ebony, and Bungalo Bill
To all the girls that I duped before on tour
I'm comin back for more
cause the new LP, huh, you're gonna have love it 
me and LT, huh, and easy does it
and do it easy Farley Flex and Floyd
We give a word to the unemployed
So party hardy while my sisters sing
for the brother who's conducting thangs
I'm couducting thangs

Chorus

[Maestro]
High packed concert halls and packed domes
You went crazy when you first heard Backbone
The club jam that made ya hype
Are you on the floor, cause I'm on the mic
The bass ya felt made your mouth felt frozen
Then you scream 'Roll Over Beethoven'
Since he was a youth Maestro drove hard
Now I'm the modern day ebony Mozart
The man of the hour to sweet to be sour
From Bichmont just north of Glendower
Those who appose I will devower
because I'm asiatic and I got the power
To say the kind of rhymes that make you say hot damn
isn't that the brother that went to lamb
the kisses I deliver are like champagne
??? or bambino put the ladies insane
When it comes to girls don't mess with Wes
by the time you clock digits I got the address
So many freaks on the Maestro tip
Is it me, my conductor's stick, or my money?
I'm no fool, that's why I'm just playin it cool
to all the girls who used to dis the Maes
say I could have been like Ice T's wife
on the cover of the albums, with gold medallions
but you blew it so take a valium
and just swing while my sisters sing
for the brother who's conducting thangs
