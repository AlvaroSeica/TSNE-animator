Damn man smoking a big ass Bob Marley spliff
Got my shit dry right now gotta get something to drink
That's my word
Pull over to this fucking curb right here
Damn shorty what the fuck you doing yo?
Yo get the fuck out my car close my door man 
before I smack the fuck out you thats my word

Bon voyage like tracy chapman ya' better slow down in fast cars
Chillin in my whip and listening to chico debarge
since arge, got a rap nigga like me listen to r&amp;b 
Yo pardon me, which one of ya'll hard niggas said 
that I listen to r&amp;b reggae and bust raps fuck that
I heard alot of shortys you be hounding ya'll
o.g.c 98 every one Accounted for still 
with my girl and I smoke big spliffs 
listen to LL and Watch will smith 
ahh shit everybody asking will the game change
if You remain the same then the game will never change, 
what it be like, me and my niggas ge ce alike
we the type of niggas you dont really wanna get hype
cause we might start acting up in your club
cause we don't give a fuck cause we real niggas so what?

[Louiville]
Yo come here, stop acting like that
Go ahead walk down here to the Bar
Yo son I'll met ya'll on the floor aiight

Aiiyo i was in the cut rolling up felling kinda twisted
Fuckin with this shorty while I asked her if she missed me, 
she boldly had told me that all I wanted her panties 
get her home and fill her up with henny, 
I didn't call she was alone that night 
and for some reason dj spins Brian McKnight
thats all i heard my word son she sang the song 
asking The ville was I on ya' mind at all? 
I try to to say na but hell yea came out I couldn't spit it out
Tell her what this shit was about
Maybe I'm movin too fast cause I want that ass 
before I jet from the scene let me count my Cash, 
they call him henny villie 
that is good and plenty you gotta just Love this shit, 
the more i look the more i look the more I wanna dick this Chick, 
but then my niggas call gotta get her out to the whip.

You shut the fuck, yo I gotta go yo

Yo doc, I just hung up with my ex, 
she tried to flex like funk master
I got my gun in my lap I can't get to my trunk faster
Smoke this weed first and then we get drunk after
Cause at home bitches suck on my dick like a pacifier
For real man will aint no liar
Word up word up I smoke and smoke and smoke 
until I can't get no higher
Yo hit him in his lip, now what ya teeth is on
My right hand let ya'll know that the beef is on
Cause this rap cat's got all these gay niggas wanna be em
Hell yea Easy lp gonna get it when i see him
Word up I learned that from my wild niggas out in c.i.
Aiiyo Charlene hold my jacket let me handle my b.i
Starang just ya' averege joe like g.i.
To my man lil and grant, when i see Em on his v.i.
But I stay on the move thats what i whip the black range Four,
