Song:   Killer Moth
Typed by: Cno Evil

[Holocaust]
The killer moth, vivid church, I harm locks
Spider-Man, standing on a ceiling with my fucking arms crossed
The killer moth, machete's taped, Crystal Lake...
Crystal share rabies with, Swish and machete's kits

[Chorus: Holocaust]
Lyrics to a cometh, it took a day, to reach the summit
A killer moth, a moth, that bites you, and you fucking die
The shipwreck patriot, I have no patience, the California statement
I'll knock your top ridge in blatent, we on a spaceship

[Holocaust]
Cocktail Pearl Harbor, you're all alone, dismal
Sinister, the brotherhood'll starve...
Cocktail Pearl Harbor, you're all alone, dismal
Sinister, the brotherhood'll starve...

[Chorus]

[Holocaust]
A Holocaust navy mate, jars black heart
The shadow star, allow a scar hit
A swarry starfish on a portal, a skinny goose, brave immortal
Con out the wood works like a Chinaman in a saucer hat
What? Flip on monk's money, yo, I was watching that
Snatch it back, ya hair off your head, like Moe and Larry

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
