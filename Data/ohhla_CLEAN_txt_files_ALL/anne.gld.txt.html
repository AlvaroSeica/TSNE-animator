[Santigold]
My name is Anne, I got a plan
I may lack virtue but I'm penitent
Ah-ooooh {*2X*}
To lose my mind it's never easy
A, shadow still there's weight to me
Ah-ooooh {*2X*}

[Chorus]
J-J-Jesus pieces, rescue me
The more I try, the more it gets too complicated
J-J-Jesus pieces, rescue me
The more I give up, the more it takes the more it takes

[Santigold]
My name is Anne, I'll take a stand
And I'll hold my head up dig on in
Ah-ooooh; you can bait me for the hell of it
But I'll take it for the hell of it
See it there, but it's too far ahead
Go numb from how bad I want it
See it there but it's too far ahead
And I hear you calling to me right from here

[Chorus] - 2X</pre>
