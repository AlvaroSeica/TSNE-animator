1 - [J. Weav]
    Your girlfriend's lyin' baby, it wasn't me
    Your girl said I hit it baby, it wasn't me
    Your girl wants to do it to me
    She wants to give it to me
    She will not stop until I let her come and do it to me

Repeat 1

[Sole']
I need to ask you a question
This thing that I heard, it got me stressin'
I'm guessin' baby, comin' to you for your confession
If you did it, then you besta tell me, straight up
Cuz what I heard completely overwhelmed me
Don't try to sell me, then compell me to be packin' and gone
Or better yet, I'll pack you up before the end of the song
But if I'm wrong, then my complete apology, you will see
This can not happen, now you know that I don't wanna believe
That you would be forever lettin' other women recieve
The love you give me everyday, I find it hard to concieve
But if it's true, then I'mma have to tell you this is the end
I'll ask you once, not again
Was you fuckin' my friend?
Tell me now

Repeat 1
Repeat 1

[Sole']
Now let me tell you what she told me
She said that you was fake and phony
Fuckin' my homie, actin' like you don't even know me
Sayin' time and time again that you was leavin' me lonely
Ridin' my pony, Angie and this chick named Romie
Tellin' me the way you hit it when I left for the Keys
Talkin' 'bout the carpet burnin', she recieved to the knees
The multiple orgasms, with the greatest of ease
And orally the way you had her screamin', beggin' you please
And she was trouble from the start when I met her one night
If I leave, "Dear John" will be the letter you find
If you want her, you can have her, it ain't wetter than mine
It be another man's gain, it ain't better than mine
Now tell me

Repeat 1
Repeat 1

[Sole']
I know she lies, but the details was all too clear
And I know better than to run with everything that I hear
Trust was never a problem for us, it was perfectly clear
It's been like happy ever after for the past 2 years
I know she wants you though, she said it on the night that we met
Now she takin' drastic measures, tryin' to see if she get
She fightin' in a battle that she know she never could win
Step it down to a 6 when you workin' with 10
Wanna walk in my heals?
Wanna walk with my deals?
Wanna know how it feel?
I'm just bein' for real
I take your word for it this time, I'm stayin' with you
Make sure it never happen, I ain't playin' with you
Now tell me

Repeat 1 to fade</pre>
