(at 10:29 am), Tuck A.P. I got these tracks nigga
I'm at the door, I think I bumped up on some'ing big nigga
I'm trying to get you to wake up, holla back nigga wake up
G'eah wake your ass up, Sgt. Tuck is in the building
I'ma introduce you to my side of town, Danger City
Welcome to Dallas

[Hook - 2x]
Welcome to Dallas, Northside Texas
Don't go on no hoe shit, nigga this Texas
You will get murd-ad, you neckless
Better respect this, or lay out breathless

[Big Tuck]
Wig split, Texas
Come with your mind right, or you'll heave headless
We so for real hurr, Presidents get killed hurr
Street life bananas, and gorillas live hurr
Watch how you move, or you'll be ape food
Our apes lift quakes, with tear drop tattoos
You will get murd-ad, don't tempt me
This is my city, we'll shoot till it's empty
Some deny us, but please don't try us
Fully automatic, we'll rip your house up
Some don't believe that, they seem to die though
My life is a movie, and I'm Al Pacino
Please check this, this where it get hectic
Undercovers come in traps, and they leave out neckless
You better respect this, won't settle for less bitch
Never been to Dallas, then you ain't never been to Texas

[Hook - 2x]

[Big Tuck]
Let me, remind you
Got bread I'll put it on your head if I got to
You will get flopped too, this what you should not do
Leave bullshit to animals, off in this zoo
You're now in Dallas, it ain't no faking
There will be no hating, you might meet Satan
Home of the G's, king of the ki's
We don't ride swangas, we bending on D's
Dallas the place, we thugging with grace
You better set your pace, or you will lose this race
I'ma cut to the chase, I'ma give you a taste
You get out of line, a nigga will snatch your face

[Hook - 2x]

[Big Tuck]
There'll be, no jacking
Cause we got drama, the kind you been lacking
The kid what's happ'ning, them dope boys trapping
The numbers too high, chill out with that taxing
This where I'm from, underground icon
Wait till you meet Fat and Lil' Ronnie, Double and Tum Tum
We are the truth, there'll be no stopping
We don't battle rap, we get them AR's cracking
