(Playa Fly)

Nigga's damin what I say, what a price you have to pay
pumping pimpin in your chest as I watch your heart decay
Put a whooping on the game. Now I need to meditate
mega migraines in my mind to much crime for thinking straight
Father told me Fly should pray, Lemon heads believe in luck
when a playa hits the crib, pick his plenty wisdom up
Many peeps be on to me when I'm in and out my home
blowing harder than Playa's Ball , Fly belong upon a throne
Blowing blunts and drinking Don, howling to the early mone
sipping , smoking Holy Dope, while you silly sucka's jone
In your mind remember Crone, cross the O, oh you never ever
 yeah your life is soon to shatter. Master plan I'm clam and clever
Take some cover find some shelter I got my God who can help all your 
faithful soldiers thinking all them other cowards left ya. 
Money making time you waist as you busta's downin me
speak Fly peace and make some paying. Busta's should be Crownin' Me

[Course]

Minnie Mae, momma name, Maxwell M.A.F.I.A
Playa Posse born and raised, Gang-Bang In South Parkway
Off the O and Lil Flo, Taylor Babies and some more
Family so down with me, never let you Busta's know
Playa Peep and take your faith, plan and plot the perfect crime
Fly gonna pick the place and time, as you local joker's die
Beaming, Scheming, thinking about it, hear me , see me, Loced and silent
Down for me and all my Foc's here Fly stand lonesome valiant
Crump from the Playa Chance, Tony B
and R-O-G, Playa C-H-U-C-K, Miss T-A-Y D-O-G
Whom smoking Blunt and hay, never ever in a day
Early Pervis, Play Dre, Fuck you white boy anyway
Tony B, ask him and he will tell you clear
Playa Phrase that pimpin mane as I put it in your ear
Blunts are burning perfectly , Indo smoke surrounding me
Pimpin blessed above the rest, someone should be Crownin ' Me.

[Course]

Busta's should be Crownin Bone, Crown Fly Nigga's home alone
Talio his royalty, Crownin SPV along 
Playa Fly your majesty, call me King of Phunkytown
Crown my dirty D-U-B for showing love and staying down
Service on Gangsta B for glorifying SPV
and make my baby playa Queen Kashawntay for ever loving me
Busta's should be Crownin Slick, Kingdoms all across this bitch
Crowns are going to Carlos P, Blizo blowing distantly
Place the Crown on Playa Lou, always knowing what to do
Crown the kingdom's SPL, Big Dean, Big Marcus blew the shoot
After Crownin Playa K, call him and he will conversate
subjects damming what he say, extra action he will take
Tag Kingdom Mitchell Heights, strap in tigh
Step in line, will pump inside with slugs that bite
Crownin Kingdoms Early Noid, blowing, snowing, and Gabay street
after Crownin all my dogs then you should be Crownin Me
