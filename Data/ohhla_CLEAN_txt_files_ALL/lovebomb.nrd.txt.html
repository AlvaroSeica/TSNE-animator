[Verse One]
Sitting here in this white padded room
Imagining I'm a meteor flying out through the distant space
How does tiny speckle Earth destroy tommorow?
So capable of so many things, why make life taking planes?
I believe, that when you lose your root
Choose the sunlight, it could be your guide
No more political dreams, not another excuse
Don't need another love song, we need a love bomb

[Chorus]
To just blow us away
To freakin blow the lights out!
Turning night to day
Hear it from miles away
Just to make it right now
Fuck what the government say
We gotta save some lives now
Is that okay?

[Verse Two]
Can't you see? This is "The Truman Show" baby
Cause when they fight, who dies, is you
Hoooold if you unscrew me, we've got the same gear and same tools
But how you gon' catch it wit'cha head hangin down?
What'cha see starin at the ground?
But I believe, even without a clue
You've got sunlight~! And it can be your guide
No more political dreams, not another excuse
Don't need another love song, we need a love bomb

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
I'm trying to revive a few
By removing propaganda but
They must of used a double superglue
I'm tryin to take the machine apart yeah
What I'm simply trying to do
Is have the reason to take a pause
I've been down every avenue
But everybody's good as gone

[Chorus]</pre>
