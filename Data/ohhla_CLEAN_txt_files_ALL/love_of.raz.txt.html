[Intro: Hell Razah]
Yeah, everybody out for the +CREAM+
Yeah, all y'all money lovers, where y'all at?
Shouldn't be lovin that, word up
(Know I'm sayin?)

[Break: Hell Razah]
Money is the root of all evil
Money is the root of all evil
Ill or illegal, it control most people
Some'll die for it, some'll steal, some'll beat you
Said some'll die for it, some'll steal, some'll beat you
Said money is the root of all evil
Ill or illegal, it control most people
Said some'll die for it, some'll beat you
Said some'll die for it, some'll beat you

[Hell Razah]
I said just when you made plans came Sunz of Man
Wrapped in turbens, black suburbans
Sharp as surgeons, gatherin virgins in the urbans
Money got you lovin it, cops got us thuggin it
Controlled by the government, we now claim or covenent
Black, broke and strugglin, you go nigga we double it
Blow like death wishes, cats that's suspicious
Targets me misses, you kill your own kind
From Brooklyn to Palestine, between peace and war's thin lines
Snakes out the righteous, drop the 4th Disciple
And plus your whole crew worship idols, we inherited the titles
Win wars, without a battle, gather lost cattle
You babble, Babylon, we run this marathon

[Prodigal Sunn]
We runnin this shit
In this materialistic world, what is that your girl?
Money, diamonds and pearls, sparkers and curls
Frontin in Troupers and Land Cruisers
Now listen loser, you could never play to scan the ruler
Keep a nine Luger for false intruders, set a maneuver
Smart computers, smart consumers, dark Kahlua's
Smoother than fantasies and luxuries, writin plush degrees
Forcive energy, crushin emcee's in my vicinity
For centuries, the enemy slept on my chemistry
Explanaty is misery, destruction in reality
Aborted to my technicalities, he died in tragedy
Swift strategies, burnt his body like some calories
I eat to live, speak and give, teach my rid in my crib
In how the righteous weigh and how the devil live
In '97 be on the look out for the bretheren
Your bretheren, stationed in grass, bad medicine

[Chorus: Hell Razah &amp; 60 Sec. *singing*]
For the love of money, they got to have it
Dollar bills, we paid the bills
For the love of money, they got to have it
Live by the steel that kill for mills
For the love of money, they got to have it
Sunz of Man will always reveal
For the love of money, they got to have it
He got to have it, she got to have it
We got to have it, they got to have it
You got to have it, have it, have it, have it

[60 Second Assassin]
People of the world today, watches the tide while it blows away
Ooh-ooh, and their money is gone day after day, wastin your time
You left your money in your own damn pocket
Strained out the socket, and do it got ya?
Finally now that your money's gone
And if I was your friend, I wanna sing along
With your dough you got dollars and your sacks of them dollars
Maybe it don't want to be all around you
Ohh-ohh-ohh, sittin on the top of the beach watchin your money roll away
Ohh, you was in that same old game, wastin your time
No more money to stall, that black drug money is stuck back home
Ohh, I said I got three mouths to feed and it's all about the money
Ohh, I said M-O-N-E-Y, third eye see the dollar sign
Ooh, just for them dollar signs, wastin time
(Nigga, fo', five, six)</pre>
