[Chorus 2X: Joe Cocker "Summer in the City" sample]
Hot town, summer in the city
Back of my neck, getting dirt and gritty
Been down, isn't it a pity
Doesn't seem to be a shadow in the city

[Lounge Lo]
I said, hot time, summer in the city
My people from the Stat, gets busy
It's BZ Mode, easy flow, if you ask who is he
Park Hill, Staten Island, it's the beat, for sheezy
In the Hill we call a rapper rizzy, and the glocks oblivy
I pop your top, if you stop and piss me
And the cops they wanna stop and frisk me, but I purp on foot
The work I put on my block is in me
Ya'll niggas is faggots, ya'll maggots ain't friendly
My nine, Heckle &amp; Koch, automatic and semi
My whole block got it in for 50, teared up
In the club, with the snub, when the Stones is with me
Sent the chip with a mean limp, beef and stain spliff
Politic with the Gods still work on a clean bench
My hood they love me, so nigga, the same bit
I still laid it hot, you know, what it seem, that beem strips

[Chorus 2X]

[Solomon Childs]
Read it, niggas is all killas
High rollers, we hold bank, though
Briefcases, the magnum it pause
Double agent features, we hustle them pizzerias
And chinese foods, as well as public parks
Staten Island, nothing new murdering NARCs
Pardon us, plot to murder partners
Teach the young to bury the enemy with the conscience
You know the same routine, holding a pit's mouth
When it's young, feared to be a monster
Gladiator, gorilla, with ghetto renevue
Whether goods or residue
Childs, the future, til you feel the blood of the roster
And I ain't scared of you and none of your troopers
Branded, with a barcode and the seeds of the future

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
