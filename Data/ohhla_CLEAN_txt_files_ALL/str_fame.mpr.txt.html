[Mopreme]
It was a dope spot front yard, one on one strappin
That's the way it was way before all the scrappin
Earned my fuckin props from the G's in the hood
Put in work, did some dirt, never snitched, never would
Rollin the fat Jaguars with my nigga P blowin up
Time comin back sippin Henessey
Seventeen years old and I felt like a God mad rich
And I had my pick of any fine bitch
And my family was known to be great, seen slightly more
Representin no matter who sets it on
Street power, why you niggaz flip and you thug shit
I be bout my motherfuckin grip, nothin else
gets between me and mine, just remember that
Damn it's a shame, but still I'm in the game
I'm tryin to get street fame

[Chorus]
"I'm a superstar..", "I'm a superstar.."
"I'm a superstar, made it by street fame"
"I'm a superstar..", "I'm a superstar.."
"I'm a superstar, made it by street fame"

".. made it by street fame"
