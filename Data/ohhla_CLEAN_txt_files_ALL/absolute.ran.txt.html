[Ilyas]
Watch me transform just like Vincent
I'm so fly; I'm like an airship cause my engine
keeps revvin to the heavens got my ultimate weapon
You better watch where you steppin, I know no limits mate
Watch me use this limit break
You need a higher level you can't imitate
Sit back, watch us attack, let me demonstrate
Try to react, the slow spell left you minutes late
Ta-ta, toodle-loo, bye bye, disintegrate
Been feelin great as of late (why's that?)
Is it the materia or is it the cake?
I'm sure my gamers relate, we want mo' hoes
But we dont call em chickenheads, we say cho-co-bos
It's I and I like Nintendo's new logo
I put whack rappers in a cage and tell em go-go
hah; wway, they got nothin to say
like text talkin in the RPG's back in the day

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Absolute, think you can stand the AVALANCHE?
Grab a sword, level up but family you don't have a chance
We got the superior materia, beware of the various terrors
we prepared for ya clear ya area it gets scarier

[Random]
Now-now-now-now-now
I been real, when I'm with Il, I spit skills
Get gil light like mythril, blow like a pinwheel
Live from the Lifestream, tighten ya flows
or get tossed in the cycle of souls
And only the foolish try, the rest know full well it's suicide
We monsters who traveled here, on the last lunar cry
Prototype of the auracyte, archetype
Parasite, get ya data right, or get shattered like
time, I'm a lyrical rhyme slave
Erase you from my digital mind wave, and start the crime wave
A project G, when the meteor falls
Saw the future without readin your palms
I red 13 chapters and no rappers come after
Ran and Il' blow like ma-ko reactors
Keep the Sister Ray equipped to spray
Command counter with the ultima, bring an end to ya day
HEY~!

[Chorus]

[Maja]
First of all, when I open up my mouth I shut it down
until the light is overhead and darkness all around
All encompassin, I'm functionin
I'm summonin dungeons of cunnin creatures until I got 'em runnin
They runnin, I'm huntin
The rappin AVALANCHE; I cast quickly
I pass cats like sands through hourglasses sickly
From ash I rise, a hack and slash surprise
Phoenix downin is the only option unless you stoppin
I'll give you round of applause
If you gather up all of your Gods
So I ain't gotta work that hard
I got gall; I'll run up and slaughter 'em all
It don't really matter who you gon' call, call 'em all
I'll run up and slaughter 'em all
And I bet it's gonna get crazy, AMAZIN, blazin, I'm Maja
When you see that Zelda emblem hang around my neck I end 'em
Suspend 'em, I blend 'em; My final fantasy is neverendin
My life's dream was just to overdose on Lifestream
I'm frightening, when I'm wieldin the mic it's like I'm Lightning
