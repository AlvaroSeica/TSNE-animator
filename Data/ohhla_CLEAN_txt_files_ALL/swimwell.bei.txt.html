Typed by: AZ Lyrics

There's a pretty big trunk on my Lincoln town car ain't it
Big enough to take these broken hearts and put them in it
I've been riding round on the boulevard, trunk bleeding
And everytime the cops pull me over you never see them, never see them

And I've got this black suit on
Rolling around like I'm ready for a funa-ral
Five more miles till the road runs out
I'm a about to drive in the ocean
I'm a try and swim from something bigger than me
Kick of my shoes... swim good, swim good
Take off this suit... swim good, swim good

There's some pretty good beats on this Maejor made CD and
Everytime you stuntin in the hood man everybody see him
They woulda put cuffs on my girlfriend, but what's the difference?
Cause Maejor got too much swag ever since he took my baby

I've had this black suit on
Rolling around like I'm ready for a funa-ral
Just a couple more miles till the road runs out
I'm a about to drive in the ocean
I'm a try and swim from something bigger than me
Kick of my shoes... swim good, swim good
Take off this suit... swim good, swim good</pre>
