(*talking*) 
Ok, open up your eyes, I'm shining 
Lights, she want the lights 
She loves niggaz that glow man 

[Tim Ned] 
He got her in the dark, no daylight for a while 
But since you brought it up, I could be your I could be your 

[Lil' Keke] 
Glow when the light shine, gleam like the bright sun 
Dream with the young Don, promise I'm the right one 
Picture perfect background, all the way from H-Town 
King with a new crown, never ever lay down 
Crazy, take her to the limit off top 
With a thirty karat bracelet, and the same for the watch 
7-13 baby, guess who the truth is 
Pull out the driveway, new Benz roofless 
Ke so ruthless, welcome to the life 
When your world turn dark, baby I'ma get you right 
Daytime night time, make her walk a straight line 
Niggaz wanna hate now, I'ma make em break down 
Call her Ms. Sunshine, physical fitness 
Swag is ridiculous, put it in her kidneys 
Showed up and showed out, baby I'm grinding 
Stevie Wonder Ray Charles, lights sho' blinding 

[Hook: Tim Ned &amp; Tre V] 
Lights (turn em off), l ights (all of em) 
Lights (shining), lights (see me) 
Lights (too bright), lights (turn em off) 
Lights, (haters wanna take it easy) 
She goes crazy, she goes crazy 
For the lights, for the lights 
For the lights, for the lights 
For the lights, for the lights 

[Slim Thug] 
All the-all the, all of the lights 
It's Slim Thugger mo'fucker, and I'm so bright 
You ain't never seen shine, with this much height 
Your chick lose her mind, when I'm in sight 
Right, don't trip let her choose a boss 
It's hard to not like the flyest dude out the North 
Cross a hundred karats, she thinking bout marriage 
Ain't trying to have crumbs, don't wanna be average 
She wanna rock the ring, from a king 
At least five, wait a year then go up a size 
Surprise, you fucking with a boss baby 
My earrings, cost more than your house baby huh 

[Chorus] 

[Lil' Keke] 
Pull up with the beams on, still got the screens on 
Pussy made theme song, got her whole mind gone 
Tougher than I can be, bitches can't stand me 
Riding like a mob nigga, this is my family 
Everything real large, real niggaz take charge 
Haters better come hard, looking for the right broad 
See em from a distance, peep me from afar 
From the battle to the war, from the stage to the car 
Up high like a star, like I'm riding on a cloud 
Got my ice so bright, got the music real loud 
Haters I crush them, still saying fuck them 
Rolling on the right rim, kill em when the lights dim 
Now these hoes crazy, losing they mind 
When the crowd in the front, I'ma pull up on time 
Showed up and showed out, baby I'm grinding 
Stevie Wonder Ray Charles, lights sho' blinding 

[Chorus] 

(*singing*) 
Oh-ooooh, she want, she want 
She want, yeeeah 
Tre V do it baby yeah, Tre V do it baby yeah 
Uh, she she she she she want 
Phenomenon, phenomenon</pre>
