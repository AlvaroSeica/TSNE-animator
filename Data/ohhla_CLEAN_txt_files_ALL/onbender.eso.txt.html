[Eso]
For all you baboon headed mother fuckers
[Bliss]
Wake the fuck up

[Verse 1: Bliss]
Don't you dare pack a bong yet, captain on deck, Bliss the
Vegabond vet, pack a strong bet, Mr
Crack a long neck, grab a song wreck, sip the
oracle of butter and just stagger on
Bliss like "wohhh"
My world treatment to the ear canal
It's soul so even when I speak you can hear the style
But no, you wanna hear pretentious shit?
[Hyjak: Ey yo yo, humour us with an impression Bliss]
"I got endz(?) and benz and gems, 50 pearls
and I'm with 10, 10-10-50 girls
And my pen sends them cheeky pearls
Then it cries "fuck me silly"
Rather suck the willy of the industry
You feel a slong? You a killer - Wrong.
I'm just hoping for a better song floating in a billabong
I spin bam boogie in a bottle of whiskey
Then I drink "damn look at me now I'm wobbling tipsy"
But either you a fast hustlin' pimp 
Will cash muscle out wit? (Bliss: I guess)
Skuzzle and whip
Or you was doin' nothin' and I'm paid shovelling shit
But fuck, it's like we're the last struggling clique
In this land it's a game and every second they score
We on the bench player, cos we ain't got a record in stores
But still they're begging for more
I'ma go silly and show Sydney
We're the freshest rappers out since MC Bomiddy

[Chorus: Bliss/Hyjak]
Where you at?
On a bender just having a ession
Who you with?
My Sin City crew cracking off at ya'll
Yo who's that singing?
Some drunk popstar contestant
I don't know how I got in this mess but this melody's fresh
So let's do this, rock this
Ruin this, knock this
world of its axis 
we back to get it poppin' 
Let's do this, rock this
Ruin this, knock this
world of its axis
Cos this the way we rock this

[Verse 2: Hyjak]
There was cameras when we came to damage the place
On stage acting like characters from Planet Of The Apes
Steal your lamenated plaques right off your neck
They rock a set eating hash cookies - chocolate chip
What would you expect from Dr. Es, you don't want no nonsense
Carrying fishing rods so you can catch a Loch Nest Monster
Still convict minded, this island got me blinded
gatecrashing the party like a kamikaze pilot
Don't try no funny business
We some tummy ticklers running fingers 'round your hunnies nickers
I'm the vicious, this is lyrics with a difference
Too persistent, it even reads "perverse" on my birth certificate
These misfits, a few sandwiches less than a picnic
You got ants in your pants, dance to this shit
My lyrics drawn in a second
That's right we come through turning Walkman's to weapons

[Bridge: Hyjak and Eso]
Where you at?
On a bender just having an ession
Who you with?
My Sin City crew cracking a fresh one
Who's that singing?
I guess some French porno star
But I'm a pro-baller and can't afford no car

[Verse 3: Eso]
I'm here, so go nuts and break some shit
and watch tears turn to coco nuts and naked chicks
A summer nutter "with fresh flows for the nation"
And god I love a "Es Es O in the basement"
But I stroll and roll with the bandits full of thinkers
and still live like we're dancing under sprinklers
This big bad mic here to give back love
Chronic cupid(?) with the zig zag stuff
So while this world turns into an American sitcom
I wait for change like staring at lit bombs
I wasn't hanging on board just like a gang of angry orphans
That's the reason why I couldn't give a fuck who sang your chorus
See Bliss and Esoterikism got that head splitin' inspiration
that everyone craves
And I got a look in my eyes, given from a hit over the head
that I copped at a very young age 

[Chorus: Hyjak and Bliss] 
Where you at?
On a bender just having a session
Who you with?
My Sin City crew cracking a fresh one
Who's that singing?
That's ah, Bonez on karaoke
He started a new crew and Izm called it the Smokey Dokey's
Let's do this, rock this
Ruin this, knock this
world of its axis 
we back to get it poppin' 
Let's do this, rock this
Ruin this, knock this
world of its axis
Cos this the way we rock it

[Scratches: DJ Izm]
"Bliss n Eso"
"Izm"

[Outro: Bliss]
Yo what's crackin
this is BL to the Steal
AKA time to speak up
We tell them we're DJ Izm right now
on the Bliss n' Eso mixtape we're just about outta here
But make sure you get Flowers In The Pavement</pre>
