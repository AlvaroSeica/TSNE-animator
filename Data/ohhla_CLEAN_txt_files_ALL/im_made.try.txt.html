[Pastor Troy]

Verse 1:

Introduction to a lunatic (come on)huh, y'all playing (come on)
Got AK's for tha stupid shit (come on)huh,
And that's all I'm saying (come on)
Yeah, laying low, bag of dro', smoking heavily (uh-huh)
Carl Mo drop the muthafuckin melody (well uh-huh)
Y'all don't wanna get this thing crunked up (uh-huh)
I got my pistol in my gut, nigga what! (uh-huh)
Younger paper, so these haters about maxed out (uh-huh)
I approach 'em they don't know what I'm talking bout (well uh-huh)
Say "Naw Troy, I don't understand,
I tried to warn all them niggas that you the man" (well uh-huh)
I'm making money, I'm country, and roll wit felons (uh-huh)
You talking bout shit real, Bitch who ya telling? (well uh-huh)
(???) (???) like a code red
And I ain't' grinning till you muthafuckin dead
Who said?

Hook:

If I go out in a blaze
Tell all them pussy muthafuckers I was gunning till I fell in my grave
And I don't sweat the disrespect
I expose the tech to let them know that I was never afraid
(Repeat)

Bitch I'm muthafuckin made-- 4x
Get paid

Verse 2:

Yeah, verse two I'm a make you feel real lame
Got a gram talking bout he in the dope game
Say he got a nigga coming from Amida
I'm a introduce ya nigga to my Ruga
You got 30 ki's nigga bring ya ki's out
Muthafucker you still sleeping at ya mama house
Selling dope for 5 years with no profit
Bitch if you can't come up you needs to stop it
Tha game I locked it, nobody else can enter
D-S-G-B representer
We in the winter riding drop tops
Pussy nigga you need to stop, give me my props
They call the cops but that ain't necessary
(A tell 'em why) - I'm made
Go get some knowledge from yo library
Pussy nigga learn to get paid

Hook:

If I go out in a blaze
Tell all them pussy muthafuckers I was gunning till I fell in my grave
And I don't sweat the disrespect
I expose the tech to let them know that I was never afraid
(Repeat)

Bitch I'm muthafuckin made-- 4x
Get paid</pre>
