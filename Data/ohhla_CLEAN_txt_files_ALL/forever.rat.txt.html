[Propaganda]
In the span of thumb to index holds all time and space
Same time your fully in this place and full of grace
I'm all but, left with no breath and awestruck
Sometimes it's too much, I should get silent
And hum among the trees melodies as their leaves dance in the summer breeze
Worshipping Elohim
I swear there's a few things that should be experienced and if you're hearin this
Then take a minute and enjoy it
Breathe in the gift of memories the beauty of the word worship in similes
Pretty soon I seen the moon raise his hands to salute ya
At high the sky at high tide wave goodbye
It's a new day and mercy is renewed
Raised my hands and praised and it rained down food
A few stolen moments to remind me of these things
Like grandmamma singing in memory of Dr. King

[Hook]
My heart and my soul (Are forever yours)
You're love and your grace (Are forever pure)
I ain't quitter I'm gon' finish the race for sure
Voy a lavar a Senor para Siempre
My heart and my soul (Are forever yours)
You're love and your grace (Are forever pure)
I ain't quitter I'm gon' finish the race for sure
I'm gonna give you glory adore you forerver

[Jamie]
I'm a God chaser, light-seeking pupil dilator
Penetrator of the truth, all things come later
Not a procrastinator just a dedicated waiter
Waitin on God to concede before I proceed
To sow, so many seeds, I know
Not every dream will grow, not every goal is whole
And so I step aside with my hands to the sky
If the heavens flash red then I quit, but if the green light
is lit then I go no matter how rough or narrow
The road may be, if He leads I follow
My time for God is today never tomorrow
Yes, I know it can be very hard to swallow
For those who suppose I was supposed to place them
Higher on my list, well, they are mistaken
Ain't no misplacements on the path I've taken
Christ family and hip hop from church to the basement
