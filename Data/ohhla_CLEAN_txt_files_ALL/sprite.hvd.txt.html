"I like the Sprite in you"

[Heavy D]
Ma-diddly I like the Sprite
I am Heavy D and I'm very particular
Others may try, but Sprite is pickier
Lymon has the twist of unexpectedness
The one you can't resist, number one on my list
There's a lot of wannabees, runnin around town
Some say they're up when they ain't even down
Remember I am Heavy D, &amp; the Boyz in my crew
And we like the Sprite in you

"I like the Sprite in you"
