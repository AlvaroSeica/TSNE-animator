Song:   Shouldn't Fall in Love
Typed by: Tha Masta

[Chorus x2: female singer]
You shouldn't fall in love, in love, in love
With no pussy, no pussy

[Intro: La the Darkman]
You know... it's like, yo you gotta check 'em
Before you could respect 'em
Cuz um, all type of shit happened already, my nigga

[La the Darkman]
I knew this bitch named Dawn, pussy was the bomb
Seen a nigga get her name tattooed on his arm
I don't know what for cuz the broad was a whore
Fucked her in her friend's house on the bathroom floor
Son, I know how to play 'em when they think they slick
Pick 'em up, but don't give 'em nothin' but hard dick
Leave 'em sick, can't pussy-whip me
I'm well-schooled, girl, I got my pimpin' degree
All I do is bend 'em over in the telly or the Rover
Bust a couple nuts and tell 'em it's all over
Well this shit is amazin' how niggaz be savin'
Like that nigga Tim, I called him a rest haven
He pay the bitch bills and he buy the bitch pills
He even bought the bitch new twenty inch wheels
What's wrong with the man? Don't he see she got a plan
to fuck any nigga with some money that she can?
Smarten up...

[Chorus x2]

[Interlude: La the Darkman]
You know, it's like
You gotta watch out for these niggaz now
I know sometimes the pussy be good, you know?
But it's like, should be feelin' real good, B
But you gotta control yaself

[La the Darkman]
See a hoe gon' be a hoe, somethin' you should know
And a pimp, gon' make her hit the track for sho'
But a simp, gon' take her in a shack, give her dough
Don't ask me why, maybe he a asshole
She told him he don't need to care about her past though
And she fucked a thousand niggaz to make her cash flow
But ya man can't see how stupid is he
He don't bought the bitch a whip, a Lexus IE
One night after the bar she fucked my man P
Said she had a man but she wished she was free
Said he told her "The way you fuckin' me
You better not be claimin' nobody as property"
She laughed, said she'd keep him for security
But he take a lot of trips to Washington, D.C.
And when he gone, she like to get freaky
Don't think that's ya girl cuz you sharin' her, G
Smarten up...

[Chorus x2]

[Outro: La the Darkman]
You nah I mean?
It's like... you know?
Sometimes you put ya heart into a broad, you know?
She really not the right type of girl, you know?
You know I'm sayin'? It's like...
Don't put ya heart in front of a bus, nigga
You'll be crushed, you know?
Cuz it's like that... you know?
Bitches'll drag you through the mud, B
You know I'm sayin'?
All you niggaz tellin' 'em "I loved you but why do me like that?
Why you doin' me like that?"
Know I'm sayin'?
Wake the fuck up, nigga!
You know I'm sayin'?
Recognize what the fucks goin' on</pre>
