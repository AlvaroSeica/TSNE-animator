[Verse One]
It's Carson in the booth every time I record
Compton, Watts, Inglewood, hood tour
Beach, Gardena, I can say a couple more
But if I do that niggas gon' get bored
Bossy ain't a big enough word for me
I'm C-E-O
No big beard but I ride like Tha Row
No punks here but let's make this clear, put a tag on your toe
No the body spray, but with the throw away
Pray your vital organs miss, you'll be okay
As new director, I'm changin' up the casting sheet
I edit you actors, delete you from the street
I keep it gangster bitch but I'm a backpacker
Not on some wrestlin shit but I'll back smack ya
Talk greezy enough and I'll send the body snatchers
I'll have them throw you in the trunk punk, just for practice

[Chorus]
Whoever wanted beef with me
Let's go
If I catch you in the streets we'll see
Let's go
We can squab or we can pop the heat
Let's go
Just don't turn bitch and tell the police
Let's go
We can make war or we can make peace
Let's go
Leavin' breathin' or you're leavin' deceased
Let's go
Better watch who you speak to and watch where you creep through
Cause when them bullets fly
Kiss your ass bye

[Verse Two]
I'm with the business nigga you know what that is
I'm in the streets my nigga, not into showbiz
I own the playgrounds now, it's time to show kids
Double Dare, take the physical challenge
Molly wop niggas, knock they shit off balance
Shake 'em like a bully then take they allowance
Hit the snack shop for soda pop and Sour Powers
Take 'em back to they childhood, fuck you cowards
(Why you so mad?)
Bitch I'm broke
Put your mouth to go use, stuff this dick down your throat
Fuck the government homie, why even vote?
George Bush, you stingy, front your niggas some dope
I'm not tryin' to be funny, it just sound like a joke
You can do a freeze with the lines I wrote
I'm almost at my peak, I'm a mountain of coke
Bishop's so church I'm endorsed by the pope

[Chorus]
Whoever wanted beef with me
Let's go
If I catch you in the streets we'll see
Let's go
We can squab or we can pop the heat
Let's go
Just don't turn bitch and tell the police
Let's go
We can make war or we can make peace
Let's go
Leavin' breathin' or you're leavin' deceased
Let's go
Better watch who you speak to and watch where you creep through
Cause when them bullets fly
Kiss your ass bye

[Verse Three]
Madden know this shit, I'm a real shit talker
But I walk the walk, call me the moon walker
I'm so smooth with the tool or the one two
Combo's with the hands, move like lightening do
I don't do battle rap, I'ma fight you
Rather sink my teeth in your neck, I'ma bite through
Make your blood squirt, spirt like a sprinkler system
Better get more body guards if me is who you plan on dissin'
I dream of rushin' niggas on stage
Give you a nice round house, Source got it, front page
I train to give you pain and a migraine
Act fly, shoot you down like a spy plane
This ain't tough talk, this just the facts
You gotta think shit up, I just think back
I'm breakin' niggas shit up, get placed on your back
I'm breakin' Suge's records, bunch rappers gettin' slapped

[Chorus]
Whoever wanted beef with me
Let's go
If I catch you in the streets we'll see
Let's go
We can squab or we can pop the heat
Let's go
Just don't turn bitch and tell the police
Let's go
We can make war or we can make peace
Let's go
Leavin' breathin' or you're leavin' deceased
Let's go
Better watch who you speak to and watch where you creep through
Cause when them bullets fly
Kiss your ass bye</pre>
