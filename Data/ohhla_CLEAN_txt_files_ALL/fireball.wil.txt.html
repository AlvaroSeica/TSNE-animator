Uhm, hello, can we get the party started...

Young Money...

[Chorus]
I'm the fireball, I'm the fireball, I'm the fire
I'm the fireball, I'm the fireball, I'm the fire
I'm the fireball, I'm the fireball, I'm the fire
Fire, fire, fire

[Willow]
Since I landed here, I go phone up Obama
Shook the world up, now I caused a little drama
Leader of the new school, and yes I'm gonna
light up the block to the stage when I wanna
Brighter than the stars now I'm ahead of the curb
Don't got' walk it out jigga walk with the splur
Levitating in my moment suit me with the fur
I'ma rock the world til they following her

[Chorus]
I'm the fireball of the party, I'm the fire
I'm the fireball of the party, I'm the fire
I'm the fireball of the party, I'm the fire
I'm the fire, I'm the fire
I'm the fireball of the party, I'm the fire
I'm the fireball of the party, I'm the fire
I'm the fireball of the party, I'm the fire
I'm the fire, I'm the fire

[Willow]
See I ain't never been the one to toot my own horn, beep, beep
Now watch me put it on
I set fire everywhere I play
make them all go insane, L.A to UK
Now Imma burn it up, when I step on the scene
My whole crew is Fresh and they rollin' with me
You can turn me up yeah to the extreme
Imma rock the world til they following me

[Chorus]

[Nicki Minaj - Rap Verse]
Hey yo Willow, didn't I just see you in China?
You're real major even though you're a minor
Your daddy keep ya in designer
You're gully, gully, gully, yeah you're gully, kinda
Okay, I'm the street fighter, call me Chun-Li
And it's going down like a bum knee
Built the guest house to put the coupe in
Cause I'm a fireball, hadouken!
Put you under my wing, I'm the top boss
Ain't from louisiana, but I'm hot sauce
Cut the mountain just to go and build a house off
So I ain't never gonna worry what the house cost
If they coming at you, tell them raise up
When it's time to whip your hair, put your braids up
Tell them escalator, elevator, you're the mean to step your weight up,
Ain't nobody greater, will and jada is my neighbour hater

[Chorus]
I'm the fireball of the party, I'm the fire
I'm the fireball of the party, I'm the fire
I'm the fireball of the party, I'm the fire
I'm the fire, I'm the fire, I'm the fire, I'm the fire

I'm the fireball of the party, I'm the fire
I'm the fireball of the party, I'm the fire
I'm the fireball of the party, I'm the fire
I'm the fire, I'm the fire, I'm the fire, I'm the fire

[Bridge]
Watch the fire burn...burn, burn
Watch me heat it up
Watch the fire burn...burn, burn
Watch me heat it up
Watch the fire burn...burn, burn
Watch me heat it up

[Chorus]</pre>
