[Hook]
Kane and Abel, who you ridin' with
Kane and Abel, and who we thuggin' with
Kane and Abel strikes back again
Kane and Abel, who is this
Kane and Abel, who you ridin' with
Kane and Abel strikes back again

[Kane &amp; Abel]
We are, Most Wanted
We are, Most Wanted
We are, Most Wanted
We are, Most Wanted

[Verse 1]
How many niggas you know can do this here
Come back with something new like this here
Everybody sayin' "Damn them boys blew this year"
25 mill my brother makin' 25 too this year
Let me tell ya how we gon' do this here
Number one song after number one song
Hoes stare at us long cause our paper so long
Niggas gon' do us wrong cause our click so strong
It's on now, we just tryin' to pay our dues
And park our Lamborghini's outside the House of Blues
Tell the police move, givin' these hoes and these haters the blues
Fix ya face dudes we ain't tryin' to take ya boo
We been rappin' for the longest fool
Since Tucker fucked Sweets on Lou at the Beau Shamboo
Now the East Coast respect us too
And them gangstas on the West Coast, they know we true
And them Midwest playas got much love too
But we represent the South and we do what we do
And the thugs and the dealers that we ride with too
And if you ain't bout cho' business then we gon' ride on you
We are

[Hook]
Kane and Abel, who you ridin' with
Kane and Abel, and who we thuggin' with
Kane and Abel strikes back again (Most Wanted)
Kane and Abel, who you ridin' with
Kane and Abel, and who we ballin' with
Kane and Abel strikes back again (Most Wanted)

[Kane &amp; Abel]
Money goes straight to you know who (Who we ballin' with)
Money goes straight to you know who (Who we ballin' with)

[Verse 2]
Feds tap my phone, follow me home
Baby goal was the year, lil' daddy it's on
We gon' live it up till the last penny gone
Like Shaq in the paint, gotta take it up strong
Caught a dope case but we bouncin' back
Now slangin' these tapes like an ounce of crack
My boy Killer Black doin' life in the pen
Told me "Watch them ho ass niggas call they self ya friend"
Po-po make a squeeze they gon' turn ya in
Don't wanna see the twins in a brand new Benz
Got game on them dog hoes that's for sho'
How far, only God knows how a nigga can go
Take the game how it go never take it slow
If I fuck one ho, I can fuck some mo'
Niggas know we ain't no snitches, they know we ain't no bitches
Dust two niggas from the ghetto, handle business
Yeah, for sho' Most Wanted
Yeah, who we is

[Hook]
Kane and Abel, who you ridin' with
Kane and Abel, and who we thuggin' with
Kane and Abel strikes back again (Most Wanted)
Kane and Abel, and who we ballin' with
Kane and Abel, who y'all want
Kane and Abel strikes back again (Most Wanted)

[Kane &amp; Abel]
Money goes straight to you know who (One time)
Money goes straight to you know who (World wide)

[Verse 3]
This is for my niggas that be on the block
Still hustlin' everyday tryin' to make shit pop
From the niggas with the sawed-off, K's and glocks
For them hoes that's so tight they can't be stopped
We don't really give a fuck if that's ya hair or not
Just do it baby, stick it baby, shake it and drop
Four tires, eighty inches of chrome hurtin' ya dome
In Vibe magazine with a silk shirt on
Come on, let me show ya how the South Coast rock
Wanna get what you want gotta use what cha' got
Shorty don't stop, I like it like that
Got big country legs plus that ass real fat
Down South, everybody wanna live large
Big money, nice hoes, nice clothes, big cars
Ghetto superstars, ya know who we are
Most Wanted won't stop till the world is ours
Yeah...Most Wanted
Who we is

[Hook]
Kane and Abel, who you ridin' with
Kane and Abel, and who we thuggin' with
Kane and Abel strikes back again (Most Wanted)
Kane and Abel, who y'all want
Kane and Abel, who you ridin' with
Kane and Abel strikes back again (Most Wanted)

[Kane &amp; Abel]
We are Most Wanted, Most Wanted
Yeah, yeah
Any ballers in the house tonight</pre>
