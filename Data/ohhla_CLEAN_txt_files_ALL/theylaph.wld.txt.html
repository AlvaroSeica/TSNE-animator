[Intro/Chorus]
You know ugly people love to make you laugh
You know ugly people love to make you laugh

[Verse One: Willie D]
Mister mister big man, used to be the dope-man
Now, you're on the corner with a bucket trying to pan-hand
Yeah, you dissed the niggaz in the hood when you was rolling
Tried to high-cap cause your pocket was swollen
Bitch, you used to ride by and turn your nose up
And me and every nigga in the hood done rose up
Now all of sudden, you was a karma
Niggaz giving twenties for a blow from your baby mama
You sold your gold, your car on Bricks
And when you walk by, niggaz start locking their shit
Cause your ass is in a slum, you used to be a trump
Now you're walking around begging for a fucking bum
And it's a trip, got the ones who had grip
See them now them niggaz is broker than guillotine chip
But I'm standing on top like a statue
Paid like a motherfucker, laughing at ya

[Chorus]

[Verse Two: Willie D]
Ms. Dang, she had a face like a super model
And body shaking like a fucking coke bottle
One look at niggaz fell to their knees
She could've had any motherfucker she pleases
And she did, but then she got married
To a nigga with a cash who took care of her ass
He bought her everything she ever wanted
I ain't joking, the bitch had that nigga nose wide open
Now, he was a business man see
He used to travel out of town frequently
But one day he caught an early flight
Came back home caught this niggaz fucking his wife
He grabbed the shotgun, and started shooting
The nigga jumped out the window, the bitch started hooting
But he caught her ass down the street
And dragged her face in the concrete
Put a slug in her motherfucking liver
Now don't no nigga, wanna fuck with her
And that will make some of y'all nervous
But not me, cause the bitch deserves this

[Chorus]

[Verse Three: Willie D]
They're laughing at you, for the crazy shit you do
Damn fool, I'm laughing at you too
Cause you never think for one minute
You're just see some shit and jump right in it
Showing off for them niggaz you run with
Doing dirt, but they ain't never done shit
But catch them in a laugh or two
You thought they was laughing with you but the jokes on you
But that's ?? supposed to be your road-dogs
The niggaz who put up to car-jack at the mall
But when you went to jail for auto theft
You serve time by your motherfucking self
And as them laws tucked you in, one of your homies said:
(See you, we wouldn't wanna be you)
And you wonder why they never came for visit
They were too fucking busy, laughing at you
