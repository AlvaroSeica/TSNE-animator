Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Hook]
I won't stop until ah, I get get get a (a billion, a billion, a billion, a billion.)
I won't stop until ah, I get get get a (a billion, a billion, a billion, a billion.)
I won't stop until ah, I get get get a (a billion, a billion, a billion, a billion.)
I won't stop until ah, I get get get a (a billion, a billion, a billion, a billion.)

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
I'm going to get it from the muscle
When they ask my motivation I say struggle
Cause when your dead broke them haters will start to love you
The women don't really hate you they never think nothing of you
But I'm a make 'em love me! Until the day that I die
Swag on a hundred I'm so fly I bought a place in the sky
Like the Jetsons
I'm destined
To do it like the best did
If shit stink
Then I really think I must have stepped in a pile of it
Bullshit, I done walked a mile of it
Took a broker home and made smile of it, really though
Benjamin's and Jackson's
Grant's down to old George
On my mind like everyday
So you know I'm a go for it
Homie say he use to get it
What he got to show for it
Little bit of money from the jury that he sold for
No navigation
I'm just driving on the road for
Billion dollar life style
'Til they turn my lights down

[Hook]
I won't stop until ah, I get get get a (a billion, a billion, a billion, a billion.)
I won't stop until ah, I get get get a (a billion, a billion, a billion, a billion.)
I won't stop until ah, I get get get a (a billion, a billion, a billion, a billion.)
I won't stop until ah, I get get get a (a billion, a billion, a billion, a billion.)

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Billion dollar dreams
And hundred dollar nightmares
Success is in my arm reach
I can see it right there
I just got to grab it
But I'm stuck in traffic
Still on probation but I'm clutchin' on that 'matic
Cops catch me with it, judge gon' give me somethin' tragic
But these haters, they gon' kill me if I don't have it, just pray for me
Money, dreams, comin' now, Homie screamin' wait for me
I'm telling him, hurry up they trying to close this gate on me
Get money or die
I never thought I'd see the day my dreams comin' alive
When I was locked inside a cell I had a run in with God
He told never look back, I never known him to lie. So I did it
I got with it, started grinding and shining
Had to take a sacrifice ain't have no time for the crying like let's get it
Now I got it and I'm livin' my life
They throwing shade cause I'm livin' the life. Yeah!

[Hook]
I won't stop until ah, I get get get a (a billion, a billion, a billion, a billion.)
I won't stop until ah, I get get get a (a billion, a billion, a billion, a billion.)
I won't stop until ah, I get get get a (a billion, a billion, a billion, a billion.)
I won't stop until ah, I get get get a (a billion, a billion, a billion, a billion.)
Get get get a...</pre>
