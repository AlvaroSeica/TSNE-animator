Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus: x2]
Niggas don't wanna hear that fake ass shit
They wanna hear fuck you and your bitch
Niggas like me, we don't even trip
Why do fake niggas even exist?

It's a real b question that's in my life
Why do niggas wanna hear about the pain in life?
Why do niggas wanna hear about the dope and price
When he still in high-school taking notes at night
Taking notes all night, give a little advice
It all starts from your friends, some wrongs and nice
Go the right way, some move at night
Some have to fall down to get back up twice
Everybody ain't family, some people don't got family
The world make you family, chips make you crazy
But be a stronger person, but niggas always wanna hate
When the next one working
Why a nigga wanna hear about breaking bitches to earth
Gonna give you forgiveness, I'm a little but I'm real nigga
Keep it positive, that what you wanna hear nigga?

[Chorus: x2]
Niggas don't wanna hear that fake ass shit
They wanna hear fuck you and your bitch
Niggas like me, we don't even trip
Why do fake niggas even exist?

Niggas ain't gangsta, what is a gansta?
It's all from the movies, being rose you anger
You wasn't born like, how you live in the game
But it's not the world you ain't living the same bra
People are deporting the united states bra
And I feel your pain and I'm seeing your anger
Can't really feel cause the cards is different
But I'm here close to home like the base was shifting
Put yourself in another's position
High prices, bay area living there
Tryina keep up, yeah, stay out of prison
Tryina stay out the game, that's the only mission
Keyword is the game no words is missing
Really wanna win, it's the change of position
Gotta see like you happy that you living
Stay positive and pay attention, lil b

[Chorus: x2]
Niggas don't wanna hear that fake ass shit
They wanna hear fuck you and your bitch
Niggas like me, we don't even trip
Why do fake niggas even exist?</pre>
