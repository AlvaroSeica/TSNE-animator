[Intro: Ice Cube]
You niggaz know my pyroclastic flow
You niggaz know my pyroclastic flow flow
You niggaz know my pyroclastic flow it's R-A-W, R-A-W

[Ice Cube]
You looking at the grand wizard, war lord vocal chord so vicious
And I don't have to show riches to pull up pull off with some bad bitches
And it ain't about chivalry
It's about dope lyrics and delivery
It's about my persona ain't nothing like a man that can do what he wanna
Ain't nothing like man on that you knew on the corner
See 'em come up and fuck up the owner
See 'em throw up Westside California
Nigga I'm hot as Phoenix Arizona
I'm utah I got multiple bitches
It's a new law keep a hold of yo riches
Dumb nigga don't spend it as soon as you get it
And recognize I'm a captain and you a lieutenant

[Chorus 1]
I can say what I want to say ain't nothin to it gangsta rap made me do it
If I call you a nigga ain't nothin to it gangsta rap made me do it
I can act like an animal ain't nothin to it gangsta rap made me do it
If I eat you like a cannibal ain't nothin to it gangsta rap made me do it

[Ice Cube]
I'm raw as a dirty needle
Choke an eagle
Just to feed all my people
Lyrically I'm so lethal
Plant thoughts in they mind just to defeat you
Ice Cube is a saga y'all spit saliva
And I spit lava
I got the fearless flow
Don't get near this ho
If you sacred to go
I keep it gangsta and why should change that
fuck you all you motherfuckers tryin to change rap
But arent you the same cat that sat back when they brought cocaine back
I'm tryin to get me a Maybach
how you motherfuckers gonna tell me don't say that
you the ones that we learned it from
I heard nigga back in 1971

[Chorus 2]
So if I act like a pimp ain't nothin to it gangsta rap made me do it
If I call you a nappy headed ho ain't nothin to it gangsta rap made me do it
If I shoot up your college ain't nothin to it gangsta rap made me do it
If I rob you of knowledge ain't nothin to it gangsta rap made me do it

[Ice Cube]
Thank God when I bless the mic
You finally get to hear the shit that you like
A nigga talkin bout real life so you can try to get this shit right
Use your brain not your back use your brain not a gat
It's a party not a jack (for real)
Don't be scared of them people
Walk up in there and show them that you equal (fuck them fuck them)
Don't be material a nigga grew up on milk and cereal
I never for got vaness and imperial
Look at my life Ice Cube is a miracle
It could be you if you was this lyrical
It could be her if she was this spiritual
Cuz me and Allah go back like cronies
I don't got to be fake cause he is my homie

[Chorus 3]
If I sell a liitle crack ain't nohin to it gangsta rap made me do it
If I die and I rap ain't nohin to it gangsta rap made me do it
If I take you for granted ain't nohin to it gangsta rap made me do it
If I fuck up the planet ain't nohin to it gangsta rap made me do it

[Intro]

[Ice Cube]
Oh yeah and another thing
For all ya niggaz that don't do gangsta rap
Don't get on TV talkin about gangsta rap
Cause 9 times at a 10 you don't know the fuck you talk about
Talk about that bullshit rap you do
Stay the fuck out of mine</pre>
