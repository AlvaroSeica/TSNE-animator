[Chorus: Petey Pablo]
I'm gonna be country 'til the day I die
Just because I got this and that and moved out from the projects 
Don't mean I forgot
I'm gonna be country 'til the day I die
Talkin to the deeps and depths of my soul
From the top of my head down to my Air Force Ones
'Til the day I die
Just because I got this and that and moved out from the projects 
Don't mean I forgot

[Petey Pablo]
Would I ever leave here?
Naw I, I can answer that without even thinkin about it
I am Carolina, you know? North and South, you know?
It give my folks a sense of it can happen for you
To look up and see me ridin around somewhere
Doin my thug thizzle, you know?
I can't leave here, ain't no way in the world
They need me, I need them

[Chorus] w/ ad libs

[unknown speaker]
What it feel like to be on the road with Petey Pablo?
Somethin I never experienced before
Yeah I remember when I first met you
You was just gettin out of the pen
Told me how hungry you was
Now you there, you made it
I appreciate everything you done for me
Takin me on the road with you
Showin me the finer things in life
Thank you

[Chorus] w/ ad libs

[Petey Pablo]
Hi I'm Kurt Loder for MTV News (that motherfucker crazy!)
Rapper Petey Pablo has gone crazy {*laughs*}
(That nigga done lost his mind!)
Naw I ain't dawg, I'm just trippin man
That's what I do man, I have fun
(That boy is crazy!) Knahmean?
Jive put me on their label cause they knew
Barry White seen the vision, you understand I'm sayin?
And he believed in me man, and I really appricate it...
