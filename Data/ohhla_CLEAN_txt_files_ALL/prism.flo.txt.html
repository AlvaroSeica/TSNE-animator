{*Lisa harmonizing*}

[Verse 1: Lisa]
Uchuu ni ukabu
Wakusei Planet Zero One de
Kyou wa funkturnnized, dryer lights no exhibition
Isoide ikou!
My time machine de
Toki wo tobikoete
Tei ke de yorimichi shitetara
Mado no soto ni woo
Nijiiro no chikyuu!?

Chorus 1: Lisa
Why don't we go, a colorful world
A beautiful world
Nee
Torippu shiyou yo
Pluto people mo, come on, let's go
Buttonderu kurai ga
Choudai ii yo
Why don't we go, a colorful world
A beautiful world
Yeah
Peace na kokoro de
Jinsei wo tanoshiku ikiyou
Kono shunkan wo
Gotta live it like never before

[Verse 2: Verbal]
Global Astro vehicle, on the way to Pluto 
See me in my cockpit, my afro is rainbow
Spandex swim cap for whiplash protection
When we swing past billboards
Written in dingbat
Meteorite bike fiends on
Harleys, going at light speed
Forget sight-seeing
Interplanetary pirates
Get feisty
When I insert the disc
I mean serious business
Solicit
Ecstatic responses from mister and misses
It's like I've been living for ages
Devastatin' stages after stages
Occupy floor spaces
With beings from all races
Even nutcases
Yo
I'm old school
Blast the stereo
With Stetasonic
Watching Jetsons with my Pan &amp; Sonic/Panasonic
Prototype T.V.
Monochrome, baby
Manifestin' the incandescent
Into the triple darkness
Boob tube filaments, shooting into the 7th galaxy

Chorus 2: Lisa
Why don't we go, a colorful world
A beautiful world
Nee
Souzou no basho e
Pluto people mo, come on, let's go
Hajiketeru kurai ga
Choudo ii yo
Why don't we go, a colorful world
A beautiful world
Yeah
Ai wo shinjite
Jinsei wo tanoshiku ikiyou
Kono shunkan wo
Gotta live it like never before

(Verse 3)
[Lisa]
Oh
Hit Prism dot com
Tobidasu
Neo butterflies
You can synchronize, crystallize
Retro vision
Scroll shitsutsu
Seek information

[Verbal]
This dub is freaky, freaky
Making party people steamy
Reboot the system
Start the extraspection
Celestial retro-resurrection
Infectious optical illusion
Patterned and dated selection, it's classic
Not suitable for the ignorant masses
I pass them
With this ride, it's fly
Octane, deranged, form and figure
Aeronautic features to beat ya
Ragtop with bleachers, so everybody can hop in
Planet to planet baby
Poly-urethane burning asteroids
Probing earth like Yuri Gagarin
Sonic shots
Bring mannequins, back to life like Lazarus
Forget diamonds (Bling!)
I bring you a 100 karat meteorite, extraordinare
Got a asterisk next to my name
On your black list
I'm feelin' right
Sippin' coffee through a nozzle
Custom made by NASA
Put mustard on my Kielbasa
Watching Farrah Fawcett on my electronic
Three hundred sixty planetarium screen

Bridge: Lisa
Ikutsu mono tobira wo
Hiraite yukeba
Soko ni
Itsuka wasurete ita
Oooh
Sekai ga aru

Chorus 3: Lisa
Torippu shiyou yo
Pluto people mo, come on, let's go
Buttonderu kurai ga
Choudai ii yo
Why don't we go, a colorful world
A beautiful world
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Jinsei wo tanoshiku ikiyou
Kono shunkan wo
Gotta live it like never before</pre>
