[Intro: Saigon]
Uh, uh-huh
Bread, and Circuses (uh)
I don't think they know the difference (ha ha)

[Saigon]
Them hundred ki's you said you flipped in the trap - that's rap
And Max B fightin for that appeal - that's real
That lil' bitch you lettin dance on your lap - that's rap
The fact she molested since she was lil' - that's real
Hundred thousand dollar link on your neck - that's rap
But when them niggaz put that gat in your grill - that's real
Comin through sittin clean in the 'llac - that's rap
When the bullets hittin your windshield - that's real
There's a very big difference 'tween rap and what's real
When those worlds collide that's when rappers get killed
Trappers they go to jail, die without leavin a will
There's a very big difference 'tween rap and what's real...
There's a very big difference 'tween rap and what's real
I'm real, is you real nigga? (Sai-giddy)

You're makin money while you're takin a crap - that's rap
Tru Life fightin for that appeal - that's real
You in the club and you always strapped - nigga that's rap
Ask Shyne how that ten years feel - that's real
You make it rain, you be throwin them stacks - that's rap
But when your daughter choose to work in that field - that's real
Niggaz gassin you to ride with your strap - that's rap
You should listen to who tellin you chill - that's real
There's a very big difference 'tween rap and what's real
When those worlds collide that's when rappers get real
Niggaz out here gotta steal for they next meal
There's a very big difference 'tween rap and what's real...
There's a very big difference 'tween rap and what's real
Right on, right on, right on, right on

Every night a different chick in the sack - that's rap
But when the doctor got you takin them pills - that's real
You ballin hard but don't be payin your tax - that's rap
Uncle Sam said you owe him some mil's - that's real
You tellin niggaz you grew up in a shack - nigga that's rap
When really you lived on the house in the hills - that's real
Said black music's settin us back - that's rap
But hip-hop is upliftin us still - that's real
There's a very big difference 'tween rap and what's real
When those worlds collide that's when rappers sit still
Lot of niggaz frontin, they really fittin the bill
There's a very big difference 'tween rap and what's real...
There's a very big difference 'tween rap and what's real

[Outro: Saigon]
Ha ha...
Now do it, uh-huh, uh
Now feel it, I gotta do more?</pre>
