Song:   Zu Keep Gettin' Me High
Typed by: Cno Evil

[Chorus 2X: Buddha Monk (Layza Life)]
Zu keep gettin' me high (spark a spliff) high (crack a fifth)
High (gotta keep on making it hot, gotta keep on making it hot)

[Lee-Major]
There's nothing like this, you hide in the mist
So I can flow, hold up, forty style throw up
Now you see the gun in the pants, fuck that
Whoa, got you all lost in the flow
Your hands in the air, like somebody screaming 'goal'
Let's go... let's go...

[Layza Life]
Drink treats and smoke bottles of gin
Don't you know that being sober in Medina be a sin?
Yo, fuck that, can't be that, like my high explode
Watch the god 'busta rhyme' and transform and 'flipmode'
Get my limp biscuit right, sniff an Asian cess
Bust a load and lay back, and puff Hawaiian meth
My nigga, who look-out flow, I mean did you send
Take your bird off your triple beam, and lift your scale
I'm high now, chinky eyed now, Bedstuy now
Shut down your spots when I come to your town
Got to stay high, til the day that I die
Better ante up quick, my nigga, I got five

[Lil' Vicious]
I got five to, and I'm high to
Getting weed from Brook-lan to Now Rule
What my Gods do, rock a spot out, this a drought
No more weed when I come out, time to dumb out
Shorty said she wanna get ecst' up
I ran the car, buck, getting sexed up
Yeah, dog, I stay with a fifth of Henny
Drunk off Remy or Tah, weed getting me high
Pass by, nothing but smoke, out the window
Niggas like damn, that's don, nigga with that indo

[Chorus 2X]

[Babyface Fensta]
Yo, I smoke so much, I'm in a drug program
I cop grams, sell it to fiends
Told my counseler, when I graduate and celebrate
I'mma blow an ounce of 'dro, yo
Roll that joint, lick that spliff, drink that Guinness
Replenish your stash, if it's low
I gets so high, I feel I can fly
Some of my niggas get fucked up off dust or angels
Chicks take ecstasy and fuck your whole family
Ride the train, she go, nope, you on the wrong route, whoadie
Yo, I drive drunk and don't crash
Mix my weed with hash, some of my niggas
Sniff coke and smoke boolies
Fuck me style, I'm a Moet drinker
Alize and Henny, Thug Passion
Get so high, I pass out, yo
I got a hangover, let's do it again

[Chorus 4X]</pre>
