Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Uh, it ain't nothing like a
Yea
It's a different kind of trust when I see you got that
Yea

[Chorus]
I know it's a different kind of love but ain't nothing like a
Tattoo of my name, tattoo of my name on you
It's a different kind of trust when I see you got that
Tattoo of my name, tattoo of my name on you
Forever ever, we're tied together
Forever, got a tattoo of my name on ya
Forever ever, we're tied together
Forever, got a tattoo of my name on ya

Yea, it makes everything official
It don't matter whether it's the first, last or initial on that ass
Legs, lower back of that wedding ring finger
I appreciate you just for representing me
Love and the pain, can't believe you was sittin through it
Friends tried to tell ya that you crazy, don't you listen to em
We got something special, baby bout it better up in it say
Picture tatted up, I swear I won't be mad at ya
Going hard, don't be soft, fuck a flower, put my name on yo chest
It ain't never going nowhere like it's paint on a white T
I can get you might be, the closest to wifey
Ain't nothing that hot, everybody say

[Chorus]

I would never tell you girl to go mess up yo frame
But it's nothing I could say about a tattoo of my name
Right there on that spot I see every time you change
Let me know it ain't no game, got me fuckin with you insane
They sayin it's my turn but I don't know if it's much room
Showin off to them other bitches, go and flex yo muscle
It's better than the rain, she said you high off of mushrooms
Skin drippin wet, it's feelin like you gon cum soon
You ain't gotta trip girl, I know where to aim at
Cock back, tryna hit it where my name at
It ain't nothing else you gotta say
I know the deal, it's pretty simple how you feel
Fuck that henna, keep it real

[Chorus]

Steppin out the scene
I would never tell you girl to go mess up yo frame
But it's nothing I could say about a tattoo of my name on ya</pre>
