Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Hey daddy (uh)
I'm onto your thing
(mm mm mm) You can't fool me
That's right
Got your thing straight on
I'm comin to get ya

Hang up the chick habit
Hey little daddy-o
You'll be alone in the clique
Hang up the chick habit
Hey little daddy-o
You'll never get another fix

I'm telling you it's not a trick, pay attention don't be thick
Throw your level to your lip
You're gonna see that there's a line then they're spittin in your eyes
They'll be spittin in your eye

You know, this ain't how it happened, it's all meant to break
But what's a curfew if you don't escape?
Copulate, lady chick, happens all very quick
Have you ever sucked a dick having tea nut shit
Bunny rabbit got it done, probly amazed
Gonna be hard to remember the names
Little bit of fame and move back to the game
Took a left back and say it was only a phase
Some days go fast and before you know
Gravity is low if you don't go slow
He's zoning out, we rolling hoes in phony clothes
God only knows!
Don't work now and it won't work when
Chu chu lord, just look at your pain
Extra burk, corrupt may it happen a jerk
Your friend don't love again

Hang up the chick habit
Hey little daddy-o
You'll be alone in the clique
Hang up the chick habit
Hey little daddy-o
You'll never get another fix
(you got a trick half of us chicks won't know)

I'm telling you it's not a trick, pay attention don't be thick
Throw your level to your lip
You're gonna see that there's a line then they're spittin in your eyes
They'll be spittin in your eye

OPP got ADD
Whooping girls up and down like the AKG
STD doctor A â I'm on
Not me, AKD â just set it free
How many just out of control
Dicks that gotta dig in the place of your soul
But the holes inside so the holes gonna blow
Stop throwin up poles outside that vobes
Come on baby, turn up the beeper
Look a little deeper, it's hard to be a cheater
You got the thiever , you's girls like reefer
You say you love me, I don't believe ya
Stay on plan or I won't play no mo
Time for you to go check with yo
Feel the pain, you feel the sore
But I promise me get down, you be helping em all

Hang up the chick habit
Hey little daddy-o
Girl's not a tonic or a pill
Hang up the chick habit
Hey little daddy-o
You'll just jump in front of a spill

Oh how your bubble's gonna break, screw with me another week
She'll be driving in a hearse
You're gonna need a deeper clue when they all catch up with you
And they catch you up until

Now you're answering and the birds will stop and sing
Give me everything that's turning gray
Now carry up your tildo, give me up the deal
You're no no not too fake

Hang up the chick habit
Hey little daddy-o
You'll be alone in the clique
(you got a trick half of us chicks won't know)
Hang up the chick habit
Hey little daddy-o
You'll never get another fix
(you got a trick half of us chicks won't know)

I'm telling you it's not a trick, pay attention don't be thick
Throw your level to your lip
You're gonna see that there's a line and it's spittin in your eyes
They'll be spittin in your eye

I'm telling you it's not a trick, pay attention don't be thick
Throw your level to your lip
You're gonna see that there's a line then they're spittin in your eyes
They'll be spittin in your eye

You're gonna see that there's a line then they're spittin in your eyes
They'll be spittin in your eye</pre>
