"Don't judge me"

[Kendrick Lamar]
I know this girl, she a real good girl, and she be low-key
Looking like a star with a real nice car, a Mercedes key
And she got a nigga, and she love this nigga, well at least I think
Every time we bark she pay us no mind, in the middle of the street
She be like

[Chorus 1] * {Each chorus is an interpretation of the chorus from "Down 4 My Niggas" by Snoop Dogg}
Fuck them other niggas cause I'm down for my nigga
Fuck them other niggas cause I'm down for my nigga
Fuck them other niggas, I'll ride for my nigga
I'll die for my nigga, fuck them other...

[Kendrick Lamar]
Until one day he wasn't acting right, in the middle of the night
she checked his phone, Erica, right? When he plead the fifth
Man, it was on, matter of fact she gone, matter of fact Tyrone
was on speed dial, so when she got home, it was going down
She go

[Chorus 2]
Fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga
Fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga
Fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga
Sick of lies from her nigga, fuck that other...

[Kendrick Lamar]
I know this girl, she a real hood girl, and she with the shit
Keep her hair tied up, big bamboos, Mike Jordan kicks
with that big butt, but when I try holla, she gon' resist
In her man she trust, so when I walk by her, she be screaming this
She be like

[Chorus 1]

[Kendrick Lamar]
Until one day he wasn't acting right, in the middle of the night
she checked his pockets, found condoms by Magnum, and the moment
they was acknowledged, she popped his eye, then ran outside
Then started driving on the passenger side, homeboy was smiling
She go

[Chorus 2]

[Kendrick Lamar]
And so these girls, these vulnerable girls, took they men up
Put 'em in they world, they vulnerable world, and just like that it was
only getting-got they feelings hurt, tell me how that sound?
They got fed up with the biggest question mark, they curious now
Cause when women get sick of men, they think of a big helping hand
to lend each other, uncover emotions when lights dim
So when she telling her to come over, it will be alright
The minute she hit the block and turn left, she be turning dyke
They go

[Chorus 3]
Fuck with other bitches when they tired of these niggas {*laughter*}
Fuck with other bitches when they tired of these niggas
Fuck with other bitches on the side cause these niggas
