[Intro: Cold 187Um Talking]
Yeah, What's up?
I wanna give a shout out to all my niggaz out there in the westcoast
On the westcoast, yeah, yeah, uhh
Yo, I got to give a shout out to Pomona
Got to give it out to South Central, Watts, Compton and Long Beach
But for now, Km.G won't you spit, spit, spit for them

[Km.G]
Mothafuckers don't get mad, cause Cali' is kind of fly
We beat the gangsters down, the niggaz that like to stay high
The land of big diamonds y'all, Palm trees, Lowriders and Movie Stars
Aiy, where fools be mobbin' with the real
Original where jackin' is an art, punk niggaz get their caps peeled
And the whores ain't scared to show the body
They wear the fly shit and freaks to set party
Give it up, and the whores wearin' baggy shit
They're showin' the world why niggaz got them pussy whip
They got niggaz goin' to Pens, got niggaz stealin' ends 
For friends, for foes, for shows and more whores
Cause it costs a grip to live on the westcoast
Ugh, cause we be flossin, We leave the world a comatose
It's all about the paper here, so hear my dear
Roll me up a little Chronic, cause L.A. got tip Bionic

[Chorus: All]
Cause you got to have Hard, to live in cali' 
Y'all, you got to have the fly shit, to live in Cali' 
Y'all, it's gonna cost you a grip, to live in Cali' 
Y'all, see the whores be legit, when you live in Cali'
Y'all

[Kokane]
They say it never rains in Southern California, that's what they tell me
G's with the big bank, Gold wire players
Livin' it up just to be a whore player
All Westcoast californ', we got them runnin' in flocks
Now, Freddie's dead but his partner superchicken got shit to the dope spot
Ugh, and like Km.G, they said: them whores be trippin'
Cause bitches be settin' my nigga up, when you are flossin'
Still tossin, yeah, I'm bound to make bread
Wake up in the mornin, found a mothafuckin' bullet in my head
But it's alright, if your game done hooked up tight
And in the summer time riders on corners
I wish you all be flee california
You save up all, went from slang dope to get a fly ride though
But still funkin' on them switches for the bitches
This is off the west ball
They call me Mr. flossy, Dollar Dollar bill y'all, ugh

[Chorus: All w/ minor Variations]
See, you got to have Hard, to live in cali' 
Y'all, you got to have the fly shit, to live in Cali' 
Y'all, the hit'll cost you a grip, to live in Cali' 
Y'all, see the whores be legit, when you live in Cali'
Y'all 

[Interlude:]
[Cold 187Um] Yeah, and that's the Westcoast Anthem, Cali' Style, boy
[Km.G]          Straight up, straight up
                  Yo, yo, home boy, they don't know, we be like flossin' man
[Cold 187Um] Yo man, let me set it off for them, let me set it off for them, ugh

[Cold 187Um]
It's the first of the mouth and I just came up
I'm headin' to the shop to put some rims on my truck
Yeah, and you know, I'm like cold on them whores
Cause I'm rollin' in a Black-On-Black 4-5-4
It's time for me to check my connects
So I could be on deck before them fiends get their county checks
I left about 11:15, I spotted this fly fly cutie in some Karl Kanis
Yeah, and you know, I'm on them gold ones
So here she come, here she come, here she mothafuckin' kitty come 
All shit, it's Sabrina from Cavina
I hope she don't remember that I tossed her cousin Tina
Ugh, she probably don't care anyway
Cause bitches up in Cali' got game for days
She needed I ride to the Mall
I said stall, I got shit to do
I ain't got no time to be fuckin' with you
Ugh, and plus, do I look like a cab?
Turn the alpine up, then I stab?
It was hot like a mothafucker, headed to the store
Saw a couple little homies kickin' it at the front door
They said: yo, hook us up, man
Bought them a Forty, for me I got that tall Can
I said peace, don't be trippin' little comrades
But that shit be propin' by my own gnash

[Km.G]
Yeah, cause we're on hit, to bring you the fly shit
To make you feel pressure, cause Cali' can test ya
Comrades still hangin, my niggaz still bangin
And there's a whole lot of niggaz still movin' yayin'

[Cold 187Um]
Because it's highly compatible to come up
You got to have heartache, you got to have a lot of luck
So if I hear you sayin' Cali' ain't shit
Yo, you're probably visited the valley, little bitch
