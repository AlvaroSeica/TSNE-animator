Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I met a lot of women on the road
My pimping is world wide
And everybody knows, uh
But something about her
Makes me wanna slow it
Spend a little more time
I like that she has a mind on her

I gotta get her
Won't, stop till I got her
She focus, she go to school
She works from ten to two, he-yo
Cus shawty, cus shawty, cus shawty's fly
I can use someone like you by my side
As long as your a rida, rida, I can lowa you down
Or provider, vider, baby are you down
So you should get to know me, Little Mama
So tell me, what its gonna be, Little Mama

Hoppin on ride, In the passenger side
I'll show you just how to roll
Come kick with me tonight eh-yo
Don't be afraid
Everything is alright
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-no

She wanna come with me
Little Mama wanna rock and see
What do we have here now
Now do you ride or die tonight?

She wanna come with me
Little mama, wanna run, quick see
What do we have here now
Now do you ride or die tonight?

The perfect situation for us both
Cus shawty you want your ground
And I'm let cha handle mines boo
Just tell me whatcha need, and its a go
I love the fact that chu fine, some movie girl can we can drive-thru
Foot off the pedal, like you and the stilletos
Wanna make you the one
Get freaky under the sun, eh-yo
That body, that body, that body right
We can get straight to business everynight

As long as you a rida, rida, I can lowa you down
Or provida, vida, baby are you down?
So you should get to know me, Little Mama
So tell me whats it gonna be, Little Mama

Hoppin on ride, In the passenger side
I'll show you just how to roll
Come kick with me tonight eh-yo
Dont be afraid
Everything is alright
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-no

She wanna come with me
Little mama wanna run quick see
What do we have here now
Now do you ride or die tonight?

She wanna come with me
Little mama, wanna run, quick see
What do we have here now
Now do you ride or die tonight?</pre>
