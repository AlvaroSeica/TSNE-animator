Verse 1
[Wise]
So many teachers, yet so little men are being seen
Everybody's ruling, yet nobody's being king.
[Culture Freedom]
Word iz life 'G'
[Wise]
But Culture Free how could this be?
Our people need some leaders and some positivity.
[Culture Freedom]
Like Farrakhan 'G'
[Wise]
Or like that brother Malcolm X
Who turn the hands of time when giving  knowledge of himself
[Culture Freedom &amp; Wise]
It's sort ta simple see
[Wise]
The Father Shah upon the techniques 
Weak... nobody in me possee
[Culture Freedom]
T'cha, T'cha! Please teach the untaught one
[Wise]
Strictly I be ghetto so you know it's from the heart
Strike for peace for peace which rightfully be mine
Disagree?  
Then let the teacher take ya back in time
Once upon a time  upon the earth
Many say we're cursed
But those who are black are that of first
Ever to exist upon the planet
Let me speak more candid
I'm here to give a greater understanding
Peace was the flow of the universe
So shut your bible stop tellin' lies that you were first
[Culture Freedom]
T'cha, T'cha! What about these students lackin' lessons
[Wise]
There's oh so many teachers, yet a lack of manifestin'
Teachers oughtta teach if they be teachers
Educate the weaker
Poor Righteous Teachers teachin' cuzz we feel
So many teachers grab the mic and just be talkin'
So many lackin' cuzz these teachers ought'ta build.

[Instrumental break]

Verse 2
[Wise]
I am a teacher
some what symbolic to a king
Some disagree when I state this
I where a crown 
Which represents the knowledge of the teacher
Weaker speak of the snake 
Which try to take this
Wisdom
Wise words being spoken
The purified ways in which I manifest
I'm never sested
Because the knowledge stimulates me 
And brain cells are to great for havin' this
[Culture Freedom]
Well come again 'G'
[Wise]
Within an automatic second
I manifest thoughts that I accumulate
[Culture Freedom]
To demonstrate 'G'
[Wise]
Mainfest weight. 
Weight of the insight
[Culture Freedom]
Light!
[Wise]
Right!... Some positivity
Why can't we 
The black communities
Come together to conquer thee opponent
Cuzz if we show just a small sense of unity 
Everything the eye see before me 
We'd own it.
Truth be the wise words spoken 
The I swings the sword
The Lord of all worlds being born
Word bond to the lost and the found
I down any clown
And on my crown that is sworn
Yes, the set consist of many teachers
Time for I to question what these teachers say they're teachin'
Who am I to question what another man is stating?
[Culture Freedom]
To who are you relating?
[Wise]
To you if you know not of what you're speaking.

[Instrumental break]

Verse 3
[Wise Intelligent]
So many teachers they taught me
I say they taught me well
They taught me to be self wise of one self.
I study what they teach me
No one could teach me how to
So you know I'm not takin' anything on face value.
[Culture Freedom]
Observation
[Wise Intelligent]
Mandatory... Whenever present
To study what is spoken by teacher manifested
[Culture Freedom]
Perception
[Wise Intelligent]
I say perceiving of a thought
Conceiving be delivering the weight of what one's taught.
It's sort'ta simple, some would say it's somewhat complicated
But LIFE IS OFTEN BALANCED BY THE WAY IN WHICH YA TAKE IT!
Me fake it?!
Never 'G', The truth reveals itself
My understanding's understood
And mine will come from no one else
Make knowledge born the duty of the civilized
'G' not satisfied
till the dark prince rise
[Culture Freedom]
Peace Wise, peace Wise
[Wise Intelligent]
But I'm not signing off yet
These teachers don't reveal so it's time to manifest
