Rock wanted me to write his song tonight but I would never be his mouthpiece
Cause Rock's like LeBron James, he took his talent straight down to South Beach
And for the past few weeks, Rock's been legitimately pissed
If you get stuck singing your song tonight Rock it's all in the wrist
Could we PLEASE have a week where you don't come out here and choke?
You may be G.I. Joe this summer, right now you're a G.I. Joke
Ever since I opened my mouth about you you been beggin me to back off
So if Rock and Dwayne are the same person, I think y'all both are jackoffs
And after April 1st, you won't be making no more movies
You gon' need surgery on your face just like you had it on your boobies
Those poppin pecs they had more work than a locker room full of Divas
I got a gift for Rock tonight, I'ma give him a Cleveland Steamer
Team Bring It? He's Team Lost It and the truth is gettin scary
Cause they weren't chantin "Rocky" last week, they were chantin "Tooth Fairy"
Keep making fun of this Fruity Pebble Rock, cause I ain't even close to sick of it
I'm Mr. Kung Pao Chicken, you just Miami fried chicken-shit
And no, no, I don't have balls but I got somethin in their place
I'ma beat yo' ass at WrestleMania and put my NUTS dead in yo' face~!</pre>
