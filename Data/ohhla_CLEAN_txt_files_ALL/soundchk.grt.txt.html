(Hook)
We want the levels pumpin'
The monitors tweakin'
Turn it up the first mic
So we can hear him speakin'
Everybody freaked out
And wiggin for the weekend
Nobody acting ignorant
This is what we diggin
Let the levels pump (pump!)
The monitors tweak (tweak!)
Turn up the mic (mic!)
We can hear him speak (speak!)
Everybody freaked out
and wiggin' for the weekend
Nobody acting ignorant
This is what we diggin'

(Coffee)
If you look closely
Analyze
Through my life
Mostly
Take a journey
Orbit morbid
Ghastly and ghostly
Theories motivated by
Being illustrated by
My comsumption
Of intake
And clean cut assumption
Of something
I do declare Mr. Bouregard
rotten to the core
Living life
And with no regard
To mental health
Feel me when I say that I was into self
Glory, wealth, mine for the taking, no mistaking
Underhanded
Sneaky
Far from being candid
Straightfoward wasn't the way for Cof- the light-skinned bandit
My way
Doing 90 down hell's highway
Screeching
Despite the lifetime of preaching
Lord
Forgive me
I know not what I do
The trials and Tribs of life
Make me come unglued
Crude to be subdued eaten alive like food
Booed
By angry onlookers who I've never seen before
I done found my thrill
Apart from Blueberry Hill
A vocal ville local with a crib in Acapulco
Speakin' faith focal
Time and time again
What I confess is hands raised to the ceiling
When you feeling Godly lesson (hype is as hype does!)
I'm cheerful expressing jump up
If it ain't loud enough, then signal Soundman for a pump up
Make sure He get your message loud and clear so ain't no mix-up
Everybody dancing wildly
Come on let's get those kicks up!

(Bonafide)
All inside your equilibrium
Thought provoking sentences intended for the sin in men
Prayer and fasted
Grounded in
The las to carry legacy
Survivors of the wilderness
Chosen generation to poses the land he promised us
Highly underrated
Widely hated
Scripture's lyricist
Imperialist
Seeking out the dynasty
Called to be the labors of the harvest
Special forces in his army
Laughing in the face of death and never fearing harm
Cause if God is for us
Who can stand and try opposing
The Supreme Being
And the Supreme Team
Double edged weaponry
Defeat has yet to see
Forever tating victory
Concentrated visionaries in your area
Making levels breaking barriers
Competitors
Giving any answer but salvation
Through repentance and deliverance
Warning of the recompense of God from disobedience
Consider us to be the voices in the wilderness
Delivering the message of the foretold prophecy (John the Baptists')
In order for direction to commence
We need the audible clear so people hear the hidden messages
Consider us to be the voices in the wilderness
Delivering the message of the foretold prophecy (John the Baptists')
In order for direction to commence
We need the audible clear so people hear the hidden messages
