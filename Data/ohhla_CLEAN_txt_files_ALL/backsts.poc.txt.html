Lucky Luciano

Chorus:
[Leon] Sippin' and puffin' all day
[MCOS] Blowing smoke through my city while we tryin' to get paid
[Leon] Dippin' and fucking all day
[MCOS] My dough she flow, when she really tryin' to get laid
[Leon] Ride with me
[MCOS] Where must we rhyme, when we rollin' through the backstreets
[Leon] Ride with me
[MCOS] Makin' a mess, when we roll it in the backseat

[Verse 1: MCOS]
M-E-X is what it is, just handle it, high heels
Gettin' very close to handin'
Any emcee reaching for my pimpin'
And yes, I'm loving this game
And ain't nothing gone change
Gettin' more pushy, when it comes to fuckin' 'em dames
I'm crushing ya frames (Yeah)
Loving the pain
Lust for the fame
Thinking like they know I'm a name
Yes
(???)
I'm feeling feverish
I'm rhyming over the hottest beats, can't get their knees off this

Hook: MCOS
I gets hip hop head
You can catch me in the back seat, making a mess
I gets hip hop head
Yeah, shorty really want me, wanna take me bed

Repeat Hook

Repeat Chorus

[Lucky Luciano]
I'm on vacation, call me Luck W. Bush, baby
And not only am I the hot butter with the toast
But I'm also a pace po' person for Steak-N-Shrimp Records
Ya feel me? 713

(Verse 2)
I been sippin' and puffin', gone, end of discussion
Playa Made Mexican in the door, gettin' his money
Lucky Luciano 'bout to open a school
I'm out the H-Town, baby, yeah, the home of the Screw
Slowed down, chopped up, wet paint, dripped out
Codeine and Xanax, know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Handle bar-popper
Lorenzos with choppers
If your money right, you can borrow my boppers
Gotta hit a lick
Mix up the sip
Better swish it up, the fire and sticks, I'm a dip
Tip down slow in a farm machine
Wood wheel underneath the bagets on my ring
Red Ben, on a black glock, right there on the stash spot
Run up my damn drop, you gone get your ass shot
Million dollar Mexican ain't having it, G
I done wrecked the microphone, so go on and pass me the weed

Repeat Chorus

[Ese Daz]
Check it out, you know what I hate the most?
When them bitches be lyin'
Bitch stop lyin'! (You need to be real)
Ha ha ha

Pre-Verse: Ese Daz
I love sex in the morning, sex in the evening
I'm a freak everyday of the week
I love sex in the morning, sex in the evening
I'm a alcoholic, sex freak-aholic

(Verse 3)
Ever since my birth, I was born to fuck
Arellano my last name, with the lust in my blood
I'm overdosing like I'm on drugs
Sex with no love
Got good hands, man, they call me The Glove
I love touching women from the beginning with foreplay
Like Frank Sinatra, I do it My Way
On the highway, gettin' some brains
Doin' 40 on the freeway, man, I'm swervin' them lanes
Everyday, holmes, we grind
Gotta make the feria, man
From nickles, quarters and dimes
Gotta hustle, get it, man
I'm on a Mexiclan plan, tryin' to get rich
Being a player money maker
It's just my human nature

Repeat Chorus</pre>
