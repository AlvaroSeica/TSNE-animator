I just want bang bang bang!

I don't want relationship
I just want bang bang bang
I don't want to know your name
I just want bang bang bang
I don't want to meet your mum
I just want bang bang bang
Fresh you drive me insane when you give me that bang bang bang

Okay Annie..
Listen, I don't want to make sex
Eat Chocolate
Look at animals
Take walk, no
You come home and you say "Hashmir, touch me down there, I like that."
I dont think so Annie. 
Don't have time, want to drink, cigarette, you know..
You know something Annie, I tell you what..

I just want bang bang bang
I don't want to talk to you
I just want bang bang bang
I don't want to know your name
I just want bang bang bang
I don't want relationship
I just want bang bang bang
Fresh you drive me insane when you give me that bang bang bang

"Oh Hashmir, Hashmir you look so good in that hat
Why dont you give me lots of kiss?" (wrong)
I don't think so Annie
You want me to do things to you like the sun and the moon
Idiot, I don't have time. I have too many deamon. 
All I have time for you know what is?
I just want bang bang bang!

I don't want to talk to you
I just want bang bang bang
I don't want to know your name
I just want bang bang bang
Fresh you drive me insane when you give me that bang bang bang

Fresh, Fresh, Fresh, Fresh, just give me that bang bang bang!
 
Bang bang bang
Shigidy bang bang bang
Shwat? Bang bang bang
I don't want relationship
I just want bang bang bang
