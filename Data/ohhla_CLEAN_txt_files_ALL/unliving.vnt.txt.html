[Vents]
Migraine pound in my brainstem, Vents drown in the mayhem
Life and love is found down in the basement
Down in the pavement, buried deep
Television and a plywood box help me sleep
Don't live, I consume, like sit in my room
I mean sit in the womb, from the pits and the doom
Watching channel one, everybody else having fun
And celebrity worship, my purpose is none
I'm the Babylonian one that burn in the sun
Stay clean, terrified of the germs and the scum
Rock a condom, girls terrified of the cum
Zombie man that metabolise minds of the young
They commodified life, guess I'm trying to die
Ain't the blast of the gun, it's the size of the lie
It's the eye in the sky that makes sure you do what you're here for
Feeding me the filth that I cheer for

[Chorus]
Now, everybody get the fuck on the couch
Nobody talk, not another word out your mouth
Let it laugh for ya, cry for ya, even live life for ya
Get away to Dubai for ya
Everybody to the back of the bus
No eye contact, stop chatting with us
Get to work, get to home, get to winding down
Get to sleep, then lie on the ground

[Vents]
Now come, run with the rats in the sewer
Dressed in the best shit, covered in manure
I'm suffering, they muttering sweet nothings
in my ear, get ahead brother, keep shoving
Don't show 'em that you're weak, blood, keep bluffing
Best years of your life in the mines, be something
Done all for the cash and all you could spend
and a fat body-bag in the end
The madness begins with my birth and it finish with my corpse
From the very first flirt to your bitter divorce
From your very first hit to the criminal thoughts
From your very first porn till you sit in the courts
for your kids, one weekend, leaving them half
of your pain and your hate, and the keys to the car
Take two, then breathe, then pass
Then fix them scars on your soul, in the dark and the cold

[Chorus]

[Vents]
Started off as a teen, my desire is a marketing scheme
Snort coke off of silicone, sample the dream
Self-esteem is a brand new car away
Short temper, call centre, chained half a day
You gotta jump when the master say
Wear a mask for the gaze of the Other in the masquerade
My best mate passed away, needle in the arm
Didn't cry, I believe that at least he found calm
Got charm and charisma, but no love or compassion
Starved for affection, I'm smashing
my glass in your smart-arse grin
Funny how a few drinks turn you to a hard-arse crim
Nice guys can't win, kindness is an affliction
that persist in the minds of the victim
Money for sex and money for love
Man is dead, truth is dead, nothing above

[Chorus]</pre>
