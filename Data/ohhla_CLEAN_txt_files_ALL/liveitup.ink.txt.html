Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
Yeah, I ain't got a care in the world tonight
We ain't really worry about nothing
Had a long day, all my life, I've been waiting for this moment
So I gotta live it up, live it up, live live it up
Live it up, live it up, live live it up
Live it up, live it up, live live it up
Live it up, live it up, live live it up

[Verse 1 - Kid Ink]
Ok, bitch what's happening,
Heard your boyfriend sheep like plastic
We ain't in the same demographic
You know I gotta do a Jurassic
Now, toast to the young and the reckless
No drama like the young and the restless
Thank God then I roll up breakfast
Fat boy roll a second
Hello, good night,
Might, tip her if she look right
Just keep on dancing, money talking
I keep on rambling
Elephant in the room I'm amit?
I'm a take my chances, go hard or go home
It could just be the Patron but

[Chorus]
I ain't got a care in the world tonight
We ain't really worry about nothing
Had a long day, all my life, I've been waiting for this moment
So I gotta live it up, live it up, live live it up
Live it up, live it up, live live it up
Live it up, live it up, live live it up
Live it up, live it up, live live it up

[Verse 2 - Mann]
Living it up, see me shaded up in the cut
Women with us with a little something in my cup
Not giving a fuck, you remember us
Yeah we looking different huh
Cause our dick is, super chi
Hella racks, what I'ma do with these?
Spend it all on fast cars, clothes and jewelry
I'm a do it like I do my trees blew
She foolish if she ask ? like 2 or 3
But everybody who knows what's up, they know what's up
They see that BBMCG and they know it's us
We toast it, for our success,
So pour a cup and put it up for the og's
Who did it before us
For all the all homies who passed that be getting this cake
And every inhale I take say I did it for Nate
Life is too short so every day, we celebrate like it's our last day

[Chorus]
I ain't got a care in the world tonight
We ain't really worry about nothing
Had a long day, all my life, I've been waiting for this moment
So I gotta live it up, live it up, live live it up
Live it up, live it up, live live it up
Live it up, live it up, live live it up
Live it up, live it up, live live it up

[Kid Ink]
Yeah, like it ain't no tomorrow
I'm just trying to forget my sorrow
Stand on the waist with my hand on the bottle
Tell 'em dream or die is the motto
Up all night no sleep till the morning
Really wish I could seize this moment
Hi to the haters, greet my opponents
If you ain't already know this

I ain't got a care in the world tonight
We ain't really worry about nothing
Had a long day, all my life, I've been waiting for this moment
So I gotta live it up, live it up, live live it up
Live it up, live it up, live live it up
Live it up, live it up, live live it up
Live it up, live it up, live live it up</pre>
