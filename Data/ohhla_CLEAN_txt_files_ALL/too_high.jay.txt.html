I know you don't wanna hear it, man
But you're livin too high

[ VERSE 1: Kool Rock Jay ]
You sell drugs and you're makin cash
You got it quick and you spend it fast
You got a life on your own and a brand new home
Drive a Benz, a 'Vette and a super dope Brougham
Life is high the way you're livin
You're always takin and never givin
It's the same story told everyday
All money's good money, so let's get pay
Suave and debonair, cool and clean
But willin to kill like it ain't no thing
Can't comprehend how the money's made
Suckers to the side cause they might get sprayed
Smokin drugs, man, you must be crazy
Although the smoker's age is from 10 to 80
Life is life, but life ain't long
To pass the test, man, you gotta be strong

Too high

[ VERSE 2: Kool Rock Jay ]
Ridin, sidin, up and down the block
Get harrassed by the cops cause you're sellin rocks
Keys after keys, pounds after pounds
Warrants are issued and you can't be found
The coolest the coolest could ever get
Somebody came up short, you had to make a hit
You can't slow down, man, you get faster
Cause you're in a game you gotta master
Sometimes you wanna stop 'fore you're stuck
Find yourself under with a couple of bucks
Punks wanna front, yeah, and pull a fast one
Try to get ill and bad, you gotta blast one
Watchin your back, jack, each and every day
You're in the game of games, so don't play
A job well done cause you're doin well
The money is cool - but it's a livin hell

Too high

[ VERSE 3: Kool Rock Jay ]
You're record's clean and they had to fix it
Brought your ass in on a traffic ticket
Took you downstairs for interrogation
Not a word to the cops, no cooperation
Still no words as time flew by
The only thing you said was, "Can I loosen my tie?"
Cops understood that you wasn't talkin
And the chief said, "Boy, I guess you're walkin"
He went to the desk and got all your things
Like your dope truck jewelry and diamond rings
Walked outside and jumped in the Porsche
While givin high-five to your buddy on the Ford
Doin the do is what you do best
No need to get dressed cause you're lookin fresh
You're comin up the street and the boys are outside
Watchin 'em waxin your other ride

Too high</pre>
