[Intro: P.R. Terrorist]
No more pain, Tiara

[P.R. Terrorist]
Aiyo, I look into my 6 year old's eyes and see the tear drop
If she could express how she feel, she make the shit stop
Me and her moms fightin' and fussin'
Can't even act like two adults and have a simple discussion
Is that complex, the only time we both get along is during sex
What a mess, my little girl's heart is being stressed
Started at a young age, my hormones on a rampage
Mami was naive, daddy was nasty
And couldn't let her fat ass slide past me
Cuttin' school, throwin' rocks at her window
Damn right, I spent the night, her grandma, she didn't know
Two teens experimentin' with sex, had no idea
That parenthood was coming next, with checks
Sellin' drugs in the projects to get her diapers
Even spent six months on Riker's, for assault
Tellin' jakes it ain't my fault
It's just a thug life, young life, what a life
The hell you go through, to come out right, it's real

[Chorus 4X: P.R. Terrorist]
Tear drops rollin' down my little girl's face
All the times I wasn't there, I wish I could replace

[P.R. Terrorist]
Wiped the tears out your eyes, sit you on my lap
I know it's real hard havin' a father that rap
But my music put food in your mouth and clothes on your back
Send you to school, free your mind from being trapped
In this jungle of hell, where more fail than succeed
Won't let it happen, cuz you're way too important to me
My little princess, my shining star, my understanding
Unconditional love, whose heart needs gentle handling
Won't let a soul hurt you, cuz God Allah birth you
And never in my life, will I ever desert you

[Chorus 4X]

[P.R. Terrorist]
Just strugglin', try'nna find a better way for us
So much stress, I feel like, my brain about to bust
Gotta worry 'bout the little boys bothering you
Gotta worry 'bout whippin' ass down at your school
Cuz you're beautiful, just like I knew you would be
Cuz complain to your moms, cuz you got it from me
Slick talkin' like your daddy, you could of fooled me
In delivery, I see little me was a she
Now you're all grown up and fool of questions
Sometimes the truth hurts, but I gotta give you answers
And explain how things work, in the big world
Some things you have to learn and find out, when you're a big girl
Remember, I won't always be here, so close your eyes
And put the song to your ears and wipe the tears
These words that I'm sayin' to you is sincere
Daddy loves you... Tiara, daddy loves you

[Outro: P.R. Terrorist (Tiara)]
