Aiyyo, aiyyo
Aiyyo, uh, aiyyo, uh

Aiyyo, uh, yeah

[J. Cole]
I hate rich niggaz, God damnit
Cause I ain't never had a lot damnit
Who you had to kill? Who you had to rob?
Who you had to fuck just to make it to the top damnit?
Or maybe that's daddy money
Escalator no ladder money, Escalade new Caddy money
Worst fear goin broke cause I'm bad with money
Crooked smile, nigga momma never had the money
Damn... I ain't trippin
Nigga Jordan, I ain't Pippen
Yeah, up the steps, I ain't slippin
Tears, blood, sweat, and I ain't Crip'n
Here's, a song you can sing along with
when you down on some let-you-know-you-ain't-alone shit
When your momma ain't at home cause she got a second job
deliverin pizzas, you think she out here gettin robbed
Please God watch her, I know how niggaz do
Half cracker but a nigga too
Talkin all that shit 'bout your step-pops
How he was a dog, now look at you
I ain't bad as that nigga
Plus dawg I'm a grown man now, I ain't mad at that nigga
But if a plane crashed, and it only killed his lame ass
I'll be glad it's that nigga, nigga
Did Kay dirty now it's back to broke
Refund checks, used that to float
Momma gets depressed, falls in love with the next
maniac on crack, use that to cope
Make a nigga smoke a whole sack of dope
Writin rhymes tryin bring back the hope
Try to ride the storm out and crash the boat
Coulda drowned but I grabbed the rope

[Chorus: J. Cole]
And there go you, and there go you
And there go you, sellin me dreams and tellin me things you knew
And there go you, and there go you
And there go you, sellin me dreams and tellin me things you knew
Sing - you got what I want, I got what you need
How much for your soul and uh, how much for your soul and uh
You got what I want, I got what you need
How much for your soul and uh, how much for your soul and uh

[J. Cole]
Yeah, I hate rich niggaz, God damnit
Cause I ain't never had a lot damnit
Niggaz can't front on the flows you got
But e'ry fuckin verse how much dough you got
Homie, don't quit now
Hear my shit and try and switch now
Know you felt the shit just now
Know you felt that shit just now
Ha - ain't there more to you?
Don't it ever get boring to you?
I realize deep down you a coward
gettin high off of power, fuck it more to you
Saw through you and it made me ashamed that I played the game
Not for +Mo' Money+ like Damon Wayans
Wanted the respect but it came with fame
I just wanted love but this ain't the same
I took a train down memory lane
And watched little Jermaine do his thang before he made a name
It's like Sony signed Basquiat, he gave it all he got
and now the nigga don't paint the same
Damn... I guess he can't complain
All the money that be rainin in
Spend a hundred thou' for the chain again
Think of old school niggaz like Dana Dane
Probably kill for another claim to fame, my brain the same
Yeah nigga, at least he ain't insane
At least he ain't insane
You ain't crazy muh'fucker, you just afraid to change
Damn... that's new
... maybe that's true
But listen here, I got a bigger fear
one day that I become you
and I become lost and I become heartless
And numb from all the m√©nages
Just one bitch don't feel the same no more
And Henny don't really kill the pain no more
Now I'm Cobain with a shotgun aimed at my brain
cause I can't maintain no more
Tad bit extreme, I know
Money can't save your soul

[Chorus] w/ minor variations</pre>
