[Nerd Ferguson]
Uhh, Nerd Ferg in the building
Got my nigga Blu Jones in the building
Got the team Sound Council in the building
You whack niggaz out'll never understand the feeling (nope)
Took a break but I'm right back at it though
You know you workin when six months a sabbatical
And niggaz hit you and they ask where your album at
And get mad when it ain't sooner - I like the sound of that
Uhh - I'm just doin what I love doin
which is not doin what all of you scrubs doin
Far from famous but I got a little love brewin
Hopefully next time I see Hov I say whassup to him (Whassup?)
I was star struck, but fuck it though, who wouldn't be?
Just saw my favorite rapper standin like a foot from me
Got a bright future, niggaz need to cook with me
or go and have a seat where the other onlookers be

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
This goes out to my BX crew
Put your hands up in the air if you feel me (feel me!)
Hustle all day, hustle all night (it's all good)
Cause everything'll be alright (ay~!)

[Octavion Xcellence]
Dream team Cardigan, make 'em sick they callin in
Haters all hurtin and they searchin for a job again
Take the check deposit it, shopping cart, and I got
ramen to the top, bitch yo' party is a sausage fest
High class niggaz we some downright dogs
Callin up the bitches that, might jump off
If I room, cause a nigga straightforward
and I'm gone, cause a nigga stay tourin
Boozy bitches frontin, lame niggaz make 'em important (okay)
Put my nut in her mouth, my kids are on offense
Penthouse suite, make sure you tip the doorman
Represent the district in this bitch just keep 'em pourin
Solo cups glass spilled on you bastards
It's still vodka, them shots target practice
Virginia is my home, I put it on the atlas
Virginia Squad design on the side of my casket

[Chorus: repeat 2X] {*last two lines ad libbed on repeat*}
This goes out to the VA crew
Drink a couple beers for your tears if you hear me!
Put on for the motherfuckin county
We put on, uh uh, I put on</pre>
