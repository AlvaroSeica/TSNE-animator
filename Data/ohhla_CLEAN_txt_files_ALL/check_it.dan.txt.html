[Verse 1]
Messin' me up, my whole head
Teasin' me just like Janet did Q-Tip
What the fuck, what is you stupid?
Schoolboy crush but I ain't in no rush
The whole world sees it, but what do you care?
My peoples sit and rave 'bout your class and your flair
My name is out your mouth but you sassin, I swear
Got me out of breath, steady gaspin' for air like
Speakin' of which
We at the beach and I itch like I'm allergic to sand
But I put up with it to show you how determined I am
(You hurtin' me man) Forget it, I ain't tryin' to set trip
Not dealin' with nobody now that's what you let slip
I said "hey yo it's cool, keep it on the friend tip"
'Cause yo, picture me screwing it up
Like ridin' dirty while I'm sippin' on a brew in the truck
Sheeeit...you finer than J. Lo
But how can I move forward if you never say go?
Kisses on the cheek is what confuses me though
'Cause out in public we don't even speak so what's the deal yo?

Now you caught my heart for the evening
Kissed my cheek, moved in, you confuse things
Should I just sit out or...
You know I can't sing!

[Chorus]
Now you caught my heart for the evening
Kissed my cheek, moved in, you confuse things
Should I just sit out or come harder?
Help me find my way

[Bridge # 1]
Now let's pause for the cause
One love, my man Dilla...

[Verse 2]
Now why you wanna go and do that love, huh?
Makin' things for me toward you harder
Killin' me, just when I think we tight
You say some stupid shit and mess up my whole night, like
Tellin' me about next dude
But next dude ain't the nigga with the clue
Who got your best interest in mind
Let's go to Cafe Sur-re-al and have an interesting time
And let it just happen make it, front-free
Just sweat me like honey sweat bees
Diggin' you, tryin' to get inside of your world
I can be your Prince, minus +Diamonds And Pearls+
Forever or however you want it, say word
But don't you ever don't you ever push me to the curb
D. Swain ain't tryin' to haggle you, I will not disturb
'Cause uh, it ain't in me and uh, I ain't no herb
But I'ma still try to chill with you
Maybe things'll change if you feelin' me too
If not then I guess it is cool
I ain't a clown like the rest of these fools
Seperate checks please

[Bridge # 2]
Tribe purist to the fullest
If'n you ain't feelin' this track, then you're full of it
Pull that li'l shit if you wanna, ya dig
But you ain't gonna do me like you did those Kidz, and clown me
Homage, comma, props
Call it what you want, but I'm not gonna stop
Record hit the store and I'm not gonna flop
And if I do, well then it's fodder for the message boards tomorrow, say what

[Chorus 4X]</pre>
