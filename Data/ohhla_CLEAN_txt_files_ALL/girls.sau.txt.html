[Saul Williams - singing]
Made me laugh, you made me cry
Made the trees and made the sky
Made the plant and made the food
Made the seed and made the root
Made the ocean, made the seas
Made the honey, made the bees
Girls, oh, girls have all the fun
Made the moon that tease the sun

Girls (girls!) Have fun (have fun!)
I said girls (girls!) Have fun (have fun, have fun)

Made the fire, made the heat
Made the booga banger beat
Made the gun and made that too
Boys oh boys get all the loot
Made the money, made the lies
Made their partner hypnotized
Now you say just like I do
"Boys oh boys get all the loot"
Made disaster, made disease
and will bring you to your knees
Made the whip and made the fool
Boys oh boys get all the loot
Made the gimmick, made the beat
Made you hurt and made you street
Just to be beneath your feet
Girls on Saturn make me weak

Girls (girls!) Have fun (have fun!)
I said girls (girls!) Have fun (have fun, have fun)
I said girls (girls!) Have fun (have fun, have fun)
I said girls (girls!) Have fun (have fun, have fun)

Made the family, made the school
Made me act like I was cool
Made me right and made me see
Made me shut up made me speak
Made me dress up made me dance
Made me dare to take a chance
Life has got me juggling hands
Girl you know you're one of them

Girls (girls!) Have fun (have fun!)
I said girls (girls!) Have fun (have fun)

Girls, have fun {*2X*}
(Girls, have fun!) {*4X*}
(GIRLS~!)</pre>
