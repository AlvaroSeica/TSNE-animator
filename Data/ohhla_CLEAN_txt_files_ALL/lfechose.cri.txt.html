Chorus:

Is this the life I chose?
to sell out shows?
to travel abroad?
become who we are?
I can't change who I am
baby I'm only one man
is this the life I chose?
is this the life I chose?

Verse 1 (Cristiles):

This shit blew up in my face fast
it all started with a dream just to chase cash
look at me now what I tell 'em
feelin' of success pumpin' through my cerebellum
but what the cost of it? fame came with hella stress
hella hatas hella bitches tryna sell me sex
and my girl insecure 'cause the ladies love me
thought she'd stick through it all but it's lookin' ugly
the same time I feel like can't nobody touch me
girls who would've turned me down now is tryna fuck me
that ain't what I'm here for it all
got tired of my mama needin' money when she call
so I'm tryna cop her a house, six car garage
emcee seein' me? then it's just a mirage
whole life changed too fast it felt
when I look at my reflection I ask myself

Chorus:

Is this the life I chose?
to sell out shows?
to travel abroad?
become who we are?
I can't change who I am
baby I'm only one man
is this the life I chose?
is this the life I chose?

Verse 2 (Symba):

I drove through Cali at 100 miles an hour
met a lot of bosses, met a lot of cowards
everythin' that looks so sweet get turned sour
labels give you money and fame to keep power
we used to be at Pam house sleepin' on the couch
now we at the Roxberg standin' on the couch
barely buy bottles at the club 'cause they cheaper by the crib
we get it in before we step out
I remember my OG had once told me
if you could feel somethin' then it's close to you
a nigga had a thought 'bout a 'maro
and now I'm thinkin' should I add the rims to it
I used to know your chick
now she only hear from me when she hear my shit
rap cops on my ass 'cause I'm killin' shit
plus I'm young, black, gifted and militant

Chorus:

Is this the life I chose?
to sell out shows?
to travel abroad?
become who we are?
I can't change who I am
baby I'm only one man
is this the life I chose?
is this the life I chose?

Verse 3 (Cristiles):

This life unleashed the beast in me
a big fuck you to those who ain't believed in me
they say they fuck with you tough
how the fuck can I trust somebody that's just tryna compete with me?
enough is enough, I'm callin' they bluff
couldn't even hold they own on a beat with me
give a fuck if you agree with me
I'm doin' me nothin' but bad bitches in the sheets with me
the shit is I'm tradin' the wifey type
for the bops tryna fuck me on the nightly hype
is it worth it? life isn't perfect
they mad that I made it, they hate I deserved it
all these hatas act friendly on the surface
most friends only fuck with you for a purpose
now money's the reason behind every fight
askin' God the same shit everynight

Chorus:

Is this the life I chose?
to sell out shows?
to travel abroad?
become who we are?
I can't change who I am
baby I'm only one man
is this the life I chose?
is this the life I chose?

Chorus:

Is this the life I chose?
to sell out shows?
to travel abroad?
become who we are?
I can't change who I am
baby I'm only one man
is this the life I chose?
is this the life I chose?</pre>
