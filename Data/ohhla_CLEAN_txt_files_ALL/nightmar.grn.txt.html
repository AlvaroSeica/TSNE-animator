[Kobe]
And I'm drunk, and I'm blowing, and I don't know what imma do
Can he cock, ready loaded and I'm looking for you
In your nightmare, I'll be right there

[Royce]
Yeah, uh. You ain't even in a round we spit
Nightmares mental. Freddie Krugar pencil on my Elm Street shit
Believe none of what you see, none of the shit you heard
I call rolling a blunt, herb turning over a new leaf
A mixture of Biggie &amp; Pac, going upside your head with a mic stand at your show, its me giving you props
My minds pure I think coke. A game to the banks broke in my flows Novocaine this Frank Ocean
It ain't the fame the hang-a-lang. Night tares by day, nightmares are the night like David Dane
There's six million ways to end your life, and I choose the tool over the bloody glove with the finger knifes
I'm who you can't stand, probably leaning. Your probably dreaming 'bout Mr. Sandman mixed up with Robert England
Me, I put it right there to see. How can I ever have a bad dream when a nightmares me. Nigger

[Kobe]
And I'm drunk, and I'm blowing, and I don't know what imma do
Can he cock, ready loaded and I'm looking for you
In your nightmare, I'll be right there

[Professor Green]
(Talking) Hahaha, everything in life comes at a price
It's time for you to pay. Hahaha
My pen is my paintbrush. I'm forever taking it farther and further
God forbid that I ever extend my art to murder
You don't wanna see me in these sheets
As in a pen imma big board of worries and new threats so does any [?]
I ain't thinking about pistols, fuck a stick. I'm more interested in doing some other shit
Planning shit out and really having some fun with it
Disintegrating your body instead of dumping it
I don't care how uncomfortable your cupboard is, I'll be up in it until I hear your front door opening your coming in
Till its time to get to work with the screws and all the other tools that I come here with
Yeah I'm fucking sick in the head. Should I operate in silence or pick a cassette?
Your drying out your screams as the blade tickles your flesh
I can here the heart in your chest beat as you bleed on me
Until I cut your tongue out when I'm sick of hearing you beg!
Shoulda quit while ahead you little fuck
You think a little blood is punishment enough for all the things that said?
Just is a blade to pick to finish you hits your neck
You wake up shivering in your bed, yeah I'm a nightmare. Hahaha

[Kobe]
And I'm drunk, and I'm blowing, and I don't know what imma do
Can he cock, ready loaded and I'm looking for you
In your nightmare, I'll be right there

(Don't fall sleep)
