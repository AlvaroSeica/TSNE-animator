Typed by: DaSun Akbar

(Chorus) Daddy Rose
You know who I be
Ain't one for playing games
Win cash, violate, shit they lay in flames
You know who I be
Quick to put the gun in your mouth
Black gloves, ski mask, shit run in your house
You know who I be
Ain't one for playing games
Win cash, violate, shit they lay in flames
You know who I be

[Daddy Rose]
Born a prophet; born to profit
Get cake and say fuck the Jakes
You know who I be
Born with a gift to heal the people
But they crucify me, now I tote a fifth
You know who I be
Born to live, born to die, cross my path
You become Jordan gon' to fly
You know who I be
Spread love to everyone, never shit
Hip-hop been doing this forever about to never quit
You know who I be
Mr. Nice Guy turned cold
Pop a mothafucka, watch 'em fold
You know who I be
Child the guards Satan house ready to kill
Thoro cross, I studied Deville
You know who I be
At this point I don't give a fuck about shit
Salty blood on your tongue when your mouth split

(Chorus) Daddy Rose
You know who I be
Ain't one for playing games
Win cash, violate, shit they lay in flames
You know who I be
Quick to put the gun in your mouth
Black gloves, ski mask, shit run in your house

[Daddy Rose]
Born wild, grew calm
Make the average niggas nervous
They say I'm too calm
You know who I be
Son of God, rebel on the Earth
My whole purpose is slay the devil on the Earth
You know who I be
Wrong cat to fuck with
The hammers speak fire grammar
You couldn't capture my motion if you buy a camera
You know who I be
Brownsville native, crack you with my hammer
With a pound, get real creative
You know who I be
Daddy Rose street minister, speak sinister
They nail me to the cross then gave me vinegar

(Chorus) Daddy Rose
You know who I be
Ain't one for playing games
Win cash, violate, shit they lay in flames
You know who I be
Quick to put the gun in your mouth
Black gloves, ski mask, shit run in your house
You know who I be
Ain't one for playing games
Win cash, violate, shit they lay in flames
You know who I be
Quick to put the gun in your mouth
Black gloves, ski mask, shit run in your house

[Daddy Rose]
Fuck a broad, get brain
Lay down my dick game
Yeah, that's my nickname
You know who I be
Spit flames call me Dr. Inferno
Rapture your physical structure watch you die internal
You know who I be
Cool nigga wrong to cross
Rose on day three now I often cross
You know who I be
Brooklyn Knight, born ball
Bitches and faggots made me this way I wasn't born cold
You know who I be
The hottest shit for 2Gs, potent like 2Gs
Leave you leaking plasma on them cool jeans
Mothafuckas, mothafuckas, mothafuckas, mothafuckas

(Chorus) Daddy Rose
You know who I be
Ain't one for playing games
Win cash, violate, shit they lay in flames
You know who I be
Quick to put the gun in your mouth
Black gloves, ski mask, shit run in your house
You know who I be
Ain't one for playing games
Win cash, violate, shit they lay in flames
You know who I be
Quick to put the gun in your mouth
Black gloves, ski mask, shit run in your house
You know who I be
Ain't one for playing games
Win cash, violate, shit they lay in flames
You know who I be
Quick to put the gun in your mouth
Black gloves, ski mask, shit run in your house</pre>
