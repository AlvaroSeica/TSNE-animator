Typed by: jostmatt@bluewin.ch

This go out to all you non-believin muthafuckas out there
Thought a nigga was gon' fall off
Peep it

A lotta muthafuckas say I fell off
Say Fesu lyrics went soft, say I'm jackin off
But you don't know me
I grew up in Acres Homes, then I moved to GP
Purchased some Mars, then my Nuts got big, real big
Then my dick got real hard
Dopefiends had to pay
Crumblin for papers, where there's a will there gots to be a way
Hey, payday, payday, hoes screamin mayday
This is my Sabbath, so I fuck through sunday
And never let my shit bend
Yeah, huh, I'm fallin off the deep end

See, wack muthafuckas say I slipped
Bust a lotta hoes in the mouth last year for talkin lip
Threw them white boy Nikes off my feet, put on Ewings
Cause in the 'Point, hoe, this is what I'm doing
Rockin off breakbeats
And cuttin up sheet rock for them geek freaks
Fesu had to lay low
For about 12 months I went incognito
But now I'm back, bro, yeah, I'm down with Death Row
But this a Greenspoint show
And this is how we kick it fuck you non-believers
You hoes just dick-teasers
Him ain't the brother you should get with
Be glad your brother wrote another hit
But what you start, you gotta end
Fool, I'm fallin off the deep end

I guess I gotta suck my own dick to prove I can make a hit
Aw shit, I'm 'bout to have a fuckin fit
Fuck yeah, I'm local
So deejay, spin my instrumental, them hoes don't play my vocal
A nigga had to jack a groove
Just to get his shit played cause my dreads ain't got a fade
Cause when my records were gettin played
I wasn't rich, hell naw, I didn't have it made
Fell in love with this bitch back in '86
The only feelings I got her suckin my nigga's dick
I don't trust a muthafucka
Or his sister or his brother or his crack-smokin uncle
I can't stand them white folks, I cannot stress it enough
By puttin your ass in some handcuffs
You wouldn't worry till I started makin money
But I can't be faded, muthafucka, I'm down with the 20

Yeah
And I'm fallin off the deep end
