[Lil' Rob {Bionik in background}]
(Verse 1)
She sees the grass is greener
More greenthumbs between her fingers
She loves to spend it crazy (Crazy...)
Have you seen baby lately? (Yeah)
She's livin' fast, holmes
She gots that cash flow
She likes to party
And she's never goin' back home {Hey}
She's on a good one
But she's livin' the life
The one she's always wanted, some say
She ain't livin' it right
Yet she could be
Somethin' better
Nothin' better than this
Expensive cars, all kinds of stars
There's just too many list (Check this) {Oh, oh, oh}
She gets it poppin' now {Oh girl}
There ain't no stoppin' now {Oh, oh, oh}
Addicted to the life
Gettin' faster every night {Livin' the life, girl}
She's doing way more things
Beyond her wildest dreams {Oh, nah, nah-nah}
She plans to make it last
Continue livin' fast

Chorus: Bionik {Lil' Rob}
She wants to live the fast life {The fast life}
The fast life {The fast life}
Girl, you tryin' to make a name
Got in trouble, a week again
You'll live the fast life {The fast life}
The fast life {The fast life}
Don't let the money do you in
Like a peddle in the wind
You like the fast life {The fast life}
The fast life {The fast life}
But you want it, yet, you got it
And there ain't no getting out
It's called the fast life {The fast life}
The fast life {The fast life}
The fast life (Fast life...)

(Verse 2)
Good times have crossed the line
More than just a couple times (Yeah)
She can do this everyday
Line one up, then blast away
She's movin' so fast {So fast}
She's makin' more cash {Oh, girl}
She's goin' full speed ahead
And hopin' that she don't crash {Oh}
Why slow it down when the
Life is fun
No time to sneak it, all you sleep
When your life is done {Livin' the life, girl}
That's what she thinks
She says that her life has just begun
To mind your own, cause she's full grown {Oh, oh, oh}
And knows he can't become

Bridge: Lil' Rob &amp; Bionik
She's been living in the fast lane
She got introduced to cocaine
Since then, nothin's been the same
She's still livin' in the fast lane

Repeat Chorus

[Bionik]
Slow down, girl</pre>
