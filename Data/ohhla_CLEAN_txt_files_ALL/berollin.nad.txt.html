and 4:11 in the P.M. on this Friday afternoon.
Up next we got the latest one from Nadanuf,
off thier debute album entitled ,Worldwide, you know how we do.
So if you have a dedication or request or a shoutout,
you just wanna say ' what's up ', then holla.

Skwert Diggety:

Let's get this party started tonight,
Skwert Diggety makin' it hot.

Phor-one-one:

We steppin' on in and let cha jeep,
'cause we flex the beat.
It's Nadanuf all up in your stuff,
you can't get enough,
'cause everything we touch is not enough,
girl just too much.
So, do you feel us?

Skwert Diggety:

Let us in your ride, 
your crew deep inside.
Nadanuf gets you high,
Now you open wide.

For the bump and grind,
we got the kind to hit cha spine.
Lay back, relax, 
so while we hit you in your jaw with news,
so you can focus to us,
so you can roll this to us.
Nadanuf rollin' wit cha crew.

Chorus:

'Till six in tha mornin' ( we goin' rollin' ),
'bout we get on.
'Cause it ain't nuthin' wrong, 
'cause we 'bout to get it on.
(say 4 x's)

Phor-one-one:

Throw yo' hands in the air,
all my true players (all my true players)
the party's over here.

Skwert Diggety:

Pull it over, right, Drova,
got the platinum gold to take you home.
Oh no, Here we go,
to the next episode.
See me flow,
keepin' rolls, slammin' doors, not enough.
you want some mo' flow,
but you don't here me though, huh?

Phor-one-one:

We got you low down,
as you roll to this sound.
While puffin' on this pound,
with my top down.

Skwert Diggety:

'Till six A.M. way in,
'till the party over anticipatin' ,
haters still hatin'.
Move over bacon,
now there's somethin' leaner.
Here we come ya'll,
takin' over the arena.

(repeat chorus  4 x's)

Rollin' wit cha top down,
not enough wit dat sound, now.
(say 3 x's)

Rollin' wit cha top down,
not enough wit dat real sound.

Rollin' wit cha top down,
not enough wit dat sound, now.
(say 3 x's)

Rollin' wit cha top down, chillin'.

(repeat chorus untill fade)

Skwert Diggety:
