(Intro - Patience)
2:60 to my name enough for the bus, the fuck you lookin' at?

(Verse 1 - Patience)
I walk home on hot coal to get to my bed of nails
Usually end my day when others would set their sails
Foolishly dedicate it to numbers in multitude
On the bus drunk as fuck, chastised by others under you
And this is something I experience often
Alpha dizzy restricted sittin' nearing exhaustion
Buddhist influenced abusive Confucius contemplator
Formaldehyde fatigue, leaking losing common nature
Believe me when I tell you this: It got so desperate
Careful cocaine membrane engaging, cost of testament
I lost my reference, alone in a crowd
Aerosol numbskull with no control of his mouth
Folded a house of cards in carbon cars of passers-by
Solvent disinvolved and all-in-all discard my appetite
Overstand I'm underwhelmed, and wasted half my life
They ask with sympathetic indifference if I would last the night

(Chorus- Patience)
Well, I'm eternally thirsty
Bury me with bottled water for my permanent dirt-sleep
Yeah, I'm eternally thirsty
Bury me with bottled water for my permanent dirt-sleep

(Verse 2 - Bender)
Stumble in bloodshot, cotton-tongue deconstructionist
Rum guzzlin' rumblefish, trouble little puddle feel the brunt of it
Stuck in a spiral slump, cold-snap finger cramp
Hold back the midas touch, long as the winter last
Twitchy brain sick, chicken scratch, tarred and feathered
I'm buying sleep from he who harvest deserts
It's a dark architecture, the carcinogen crab
With word-of-mouth marketing plans and bargain-bin wax
The carnal pleasure, hackin' from a harsh cough that plagues me
Pulse like Apache, my heart got a breakbeat
Sargeant Pepper-spray medicinal approach
Now with Pandora's voice-box positioned in my throat
Chokin' - Golden lowlife, picky bottomfeeder
Exposed to strobelights hit with quick staccato seizures
Let 'em burn me, see I'm eternally thirsty
Make that last drink shaken, not stirred, in my urn please

(Chorus - Patience, Bender)
Don't burn me, I'm eternally thirsty
Bury me with bottled water for my permanent dirt-sleep
Yeah, yeah I'm eternally thirsty
Make that last drink shaken, not stirred, in my urn please
Overstand I'm underwhelmed, eternally thirsty
Bury me with bottled water for my permanent dirt-sleep
That's right, I'm eternally thirsty
Make that last drink shaken, not stirred, in my urn please

(Scratches - DJ CalKuta)
