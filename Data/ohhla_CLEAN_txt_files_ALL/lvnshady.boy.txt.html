Typed by: no1wammy@hotmail.com

Chorus: Fingazz
I been livin' shady (Cheating on my lady)
Ever since she left me (I been going crazy)
Thinking about my baby
I know I did you wrong
Just listen to my song
I wanna make it up ("Make it up...")
I been livin' shady (To you, cheating on my lady)
Ever since she left me (I been going crazy)
Thinking about my baby
I know I did you wrong
Just listen to my song
I wanna make it up
To you ("To you...")

[Brown Boy]
(Verse 1)
Now I know that you leaving cause it feels like I'm not breathin'
Pain up in my chest
At night, I can't rest
Cause I
Toss and turn
This feeling inside
Oh, how it burns
To see you go away, and I
Guess it's true, what they say
When your heart goes to play
You lose the one you love
That's something that I
Never thought of now
You walkin' out my life
Without you in my life, I got
Nothing left
I should've never came home with hickeys on my neck
To hangups on the phone, ain't helping ya stress
Cause your tears keep falling like rain
I can't erase the pain, I can only try to change

Repeat Chorus

[Brown Boy]
I know I ain't livin' right
And I don't expect you to take me back
And I don't expect you to forgive me
But baby
Just listen to me

(Verse 2)
I been up and down and all around, searching for you, baby
Cause ever since you left me
I been goin' crazy
I'm losing my mind
Thinking of you, all the time
Wishin' I could press rewind and get you back, one more time
If I get another try, I will never make you cry
I promise, to give you the best, nothing less
Treat you like my princess and love you til the death
Til death do us part, you will stay in my heart
Siempre en mi corazon, siempre en mi vida
For life
Por vida
Tu eres, mi chica
Tan linda
And I plan to make things right
Cause next time around, I'm gonna make you my wife

Repeat Chorus

Bridge: Fingazz
Just tell me what I can do to
Make it better
I'll do anything
I'm sorry I made you cry
I cheated and I lie
If there was some way that I could
Take it all back
I'll do anything
Just tell me
Tell me what to do
Cause I wanna make it up, too

Repeat Chorus

[Brown Boy]
And you know I'm doin' this song to make it up to you, baby
I just wanna let you know I'm real
And I'm here for you
No matter what happens

[Fingazz]
"Make it up..."
"To you..."</pre>
