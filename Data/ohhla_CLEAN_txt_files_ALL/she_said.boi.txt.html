[Theophilus London]
We at the freaknik affair, throw your money in the air
Let it rain, rain, let it rain down
She wanna skip the winter just to shake it in the summer
If I didn't show up to your party, homie, that's a bummer
Strippers on the pole and they goin' up and down
I sip out my cup, cup, to make me calm down
I'm a fly Brooklyn, bitch
But when I'm in Atlanta, I be sticking ones in her thong, hit it with bandanas
I'mma play that cat like it was played by Santana
Bitch, I hit you up manana for a recap my hang--
My hang, I'm a freak, girl, watch me take a peak, girl
Touchin' on your nipples, mighty long, take a seat, girl
Wanna introduce you to my mighty long
and dance to songs, it could take you all night long
What you hidin' in that dress? Curiosity is killin' me
When we hit the stage, tell them mark niggas you feelin' me

[Chorus: Tre Luce]
Lemme see ya titties...
Lemme see ya titties...
She said okay...
Okay...
Now, lemme see ya pussy... (Let me!)
Lemme see ya pussy
She said okay...
Okay...

[Big Boi]
(Yeah) 
Monday night, Atlanta, Georgia, they say all the hoes at Magic
See, no, I'm no David Copperfield, but I'm sure I can pull a rabbit
See, I'm adamant when I see something I want, I reach out and grab it
Like this cannabis that I'm blowin', bust the package, boy, it's cherry kush
Uh, stank ya smelly much
but this is the only hairy bush I would like to put my lips on
I like that pussy Brazilian waxed with the lips showin'
Tip toe in the high heels or her bare feet and she down for some major dick blowin' (Yup!)
How many licks does it take to get to the bottom of Tootsie Roll (What?)
Pop goes the weasel when I explode in her mouth, boy, that's cold--
--er than Shaquille O'Neal from the free throw line
And I'm a peaceful person, so she wanted to give me piece of mind
Now it appears that I am brain dead
My legs feel like Joe from Family Guy because she got insane head
Call me crazy, but nowadays it seems like nothin' is sacred
Oh well, I already got me somebody to play with

[Chorus: Tre Luce]
Lemme see ya titties... (Let me!)
Lemme see ya titties...
She said okay...
Okay...
Now, lemme see ya pussy... (Let me!)
Lemme see ya pussy
She said okay...
Okay...

[Tre Luce]
I just wanna give you all my time (Give you all my time)
Baby, let me blow your mind, your mind
Oh, your mind
Girl, I want you to climb on top of me
Girl, on top of me, babe
Could you please let me see, let me see, let me see
Let me see, let me see

[Chorus: Tre Luce]
Lemme see ya titties... (Let me!)
Lemme see ya titties...
She said okay...
Okay...
Now, lemme see ya pussy... (Let me!)
Lemme see ya pussy
She said okay...
Okay...</pre>
