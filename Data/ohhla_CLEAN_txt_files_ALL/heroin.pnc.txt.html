(Kangol Slim)

Give me some heroin baby....
That heroin's got me crazy....

Chorus (Kangol Slim):

Give me some heroin baby,
That heroin's got me crazy,
Give me some heroin PLEASE,
Cuz powder makes me sneeze,
Give me some heroin DARLING,
That heroin's got me crawlin',
Give me some heroin PLEASE,
Cuz powder makes me sneeze

First Verse (Misdemeanor):

Like Holly Grove done said, the high gone got me stitchin',
But I need a heroin bag cuz bitch, I'm itchin',
Snorted in the mornin' when I'm chillin' with Bret,
Get high as a mutha when we're ready to jet,
Go chill on the set with lil' cubie and Mel,
The first car that we seen we got spooked as Hell,
Nigga roll on the set, who it is?  Five oh,
Pack the shit, close shop, and we'll be ready to go,
Five oh's on my back, cuz they think that I'm holdin',
But I'ma let them muthafuckas know,
That I done got too loaded, too loaded, too loaded, too loaded,
That I done got too loaded, too loaded, too loaded, too loaded,
They say that cocaine's bad, but that heroin's worse,
So Kangol Slim kick the next fuckin' verse

Chorus

Second Verse (Misdemeanor):

Aw shit, my mind done clipped, that heroin's got me trippin',
I done did too much wrong, I might get caught slippin',
My nose started bleedin' evidence is showin',
Heroin's got me gone and everybody's knowin',
My mind is in another World as spooked as I wanna be,
Constantly watch my back because I think these niggas after me,
Five oh is ridin' my dick mane,
Because they think that the Meanor, is sellin' cocaine,
But that's not it, I just love to get high,
So I snort a lil' heroin just to make time fly,
And check it, when I get high, I really get blowed,
Snortin' nothin' but the heroin up my muthafuckin' nose,
Cuz um, when I get high, I really get blowed,
Snortin' nothin' but the heroin up my muthafuckin' nose, so

Chorus

(Kangol Slim):

I get so God damned spooked out, I go and grab my gun,
Shoot a little bit of heroin, and that shit makes everything so fun
