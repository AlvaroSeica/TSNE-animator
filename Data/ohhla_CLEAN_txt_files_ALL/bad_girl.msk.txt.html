Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
I can be a bad girl too
Just let me know and
I'm through
Drowning in my tears
I cried enough for you
If I was a bad girl would you
Love me more if I did everything
Those girls did before

I always wanted to be what you
Wanted the most but I'm guessing
Personality don't matter no more
From what I knew you got caught
Up in this whole situation
Have to look firm have to give into temptation
It's what you want cause that's
All that you been getting
Can't pass through crowd of
Hynas with out you staring
I guess you never been with
A girl like me but
I want you so bad and
That ain't hard to see that
I'm trying to do things that
I've never done before and
What for so you could always
Keep asking for more
And not enough
The things I do you hardly even notice
Day dream about the day you say mija no llores

[Chorus]
I can be a bad girl too
Just let me know and
I'm through
Drowning in my tears
I cried enough for you
If I was a bad girl would you
Love me more if I did everything
Those girls did before

[Brown Boy]
What's up ma it's your boy
Brown boy and
Ah I know what your saying and
Everything but I been trying to
Change my ways too
So won't you listen to me one time

Your my angel in disguise my good girl
Baby that's been there to ride
Never understood why you stuck
By my side after all
The years that I made you cry
And told you lies
You gave me your heart
And I done broke it in two
Messed around with the bad girls
And played you for a fool
The tears keep falling and I know
It ain't cool and I'm down on my knees
Trying to make it up to you I'm sorry
I'm sorry for the things I've done
I was acting like a child
Just having my fun the truth about it
All is that your my number one
Te necesito en mi vida
Cause your still the one ay

[Chorus]
I can be a bad girl too
Just let me know and
I'm through
Drowning in my tears
I cried enough for you
If I was a bad girl would you
Love me more if I did everything
Those girls did before

Every time I see you surrounded by all of em
I try to check who you like guess
That's all of them and I
Can't blame you they all
Got you smiling and down
To put out when you want drinkin Heineken
You wanna be with
Somebody that I'm not
Somebody who won't care
If you never call her back
See I don't gotta change one thing homitas
Telling me but if I was a bad girl
Too you be down for me
Get all confused when I see
You around me
Wish I could do all the things that you ask of me
But in the back of my head
Something telling me
Don't ever change mija
Please you'll remember this
You think he wants another hoe
On his list you think he don't know
You'll be his mija
Of course he does and
That's why ladies fall off
Hit it and quit it
Now I know you
Don't want that

[Chorus]
I can be a bad girl too
Just let me know and
I'm through
Drowning in my tears
I cried enough for you
If I was a bad girl would you
Love me more if I did everything
Those girls did before</pre>
