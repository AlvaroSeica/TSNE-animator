Chorus: Chag G
Still, I wanna be
Right here in my hood
Still, I wanna be
In the streets, sippin' cognac
Still, I wanna be
In my (???), killin' (???)
Still, I wanna be
In the streets, yeah

[Mr. Lil' One]
(Verse 1)
I keep it moving while we groovin' in the sunshine
Give it to me, let me hear it just one time
To my mother and my brother up in heaven now
It took a little bit, it's better, cause I'm ready now
To the homies, doing time, and I mean everyone
Seperated from their ladies and their little ones
To our mothers in the ghetto, did the best they could
Kinda hard, without a daughter in the neighborhood
But we made it through the good and through the bad, too
Through the trouble and the struggles, see we had to
To the homies with the Khakis and the Pennotins
To their young'n's, to their G's, to the veterans
Through the drama, without mama and it never ends
To the letter for the homies that I'm 'bout to send
To the homies with the lolo's and the hydros
To the all, to the pen, to the barrios

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 2)
Tell the mamis and the daddies with their babies
I know it's hard and they may seem a little crazy
To my ladies with their babies by their lonesone
Your little baby will, one day, will be a grown son
And it's harder in the night, but then the light come
You made a choice, baby girl, and it's right one
And to my people with this struggle, tryna cope here...
We're living in the dark, but there's hope there
To the ghettos of the world, we gotta keep strong
Gotta fight to keep it right and try to shake wrong
Let me hear it for the people in the back, too
To my little baby girls, daddy thanks you

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 3)
And to the homies in the back with the cold one
All the homies with the sack, going broke one
See, we do it cause we love it, and it's like that
If you coming, then you barking, then we bite back
To the homies playing ball on a Sunday
To the homies where the L may be one day
To the young'n's in the hood with the hoodies on
Little mamis at the party, get their cuties on
Tell the ones that never made it, how we miss you
How we swig, how we trip and reminisce you
To the G's on the blocks, steady, fresh out
To my homie, Dan, I'm waiting til he gets out
I'm a leave ya to the men, and I'm a roll now
I been doing it for ten, time to blow now
So I leave you with my love and all the peace sign
From the west, to the south, to the east side
