[Dresta]
Easily I approach
The microphone because I ain't no joke
Nigga tell Kurupt, Nate and Daz i'mma buck 'em
Matter of fact tell that whole pound I say fuck 'em
It's a new year so put the bustas in their plizace
BG Knocc and gangsta Dresta bring it to your fizace
Riders on a mission
I catch you slippin, you getting struck clown
So fuck any busta thats down with the mutt pound

[BG Knocc Out]
It's the compton city G nigga
Bow to your knees nigga
Run up in your hood
Cock back my strap and pull the treez nigga
And if you slippin, you know i'm gonna wet cha
I'm the baby boss hogg, better known as the dogg catcher
Bow wow yipee yay, didn't you hear me say
I'm a dogg killa, cos all doggs have they day
Now who wanna fool me, if your not prepared to fight
Little Knocc Out can't be phased, baby gangsta for life

Chorus X2

Dat Nigga Daz (Killa)
Kurupt (Killa)
Dr Dre (Killa)
Mark ass niggas
Snoop Dogg (Killa)
Nate Dogg (Killa)
Tha Dogg Pound (Killa)
Fuck, fuck all y'all, niggas

[Dresta]
I bring the noise everytime a nigga wind me up
I pull my nine and blow a mind, everytime I bust
I trust no man and thats from now until infinity
Nigga you either my homie or just consider yourself my enemy
Niggas out here fake dog, like Nate Dogg
I swear you made it, but talkin that shit to Dre
Will get you and your DJ regulated
Bitches come a diamond sack, so lets get it straight
A fake is what I hate, so fuck Kurupt, Daz and Nate

[BG Knocc Out]
Motherfucking fake
Niggas be thinking that they can get with the real deal
What I would do, If I was you is take a chill pill
Yet and still tricks, I gave your click a bust
But when i see that busta Daz
I gotta fade his ass
Smash, down another puppy pound clown
With the round from my smith
And watch his body shift
Drift his soul in the wind as they carry you
And big K-O can dig your hole before they bury you

Bridge X2

Pranksters, studio gangstas, bustas
Softer than a bitch but betrayed the role of gangsta
Pranksters, studio gangstas, bustas
Stupid motherfucker, yeah thats what i'm saying

[BG Knocc Out]
So now you niggas know, who in the fuck you fucking with
B-G and D-R-E nigga, the baby gangsta click
As we drop some gangsta shit
From a real G's perspective
Niggas get all like pumped
While I stay calm and collective
I check those suckas
They callin self and causing ruckus
94 set claimin, Snoop, D-O bangin bustas

[Dresta]
Much love, to the BG, CPT
Much love, to the DRE, OBG
Much love, to the Eazy-E, CPT
And DPG don't wanna see us, see see
You fools ain't nothing but marks, so fuck your set
Now whats next
I doubt if you wanna flex, no respect
Run up and get wrecked
You tried to diss the BG, although we let that shit pass
Daz you fuck around and find your ugly ass
Smashed in a trash bag, fool
You wanna be caught up be laying down
If you keep fuckin around with the Comp-town
