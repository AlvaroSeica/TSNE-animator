[ VERSE 1: Oh No ]
This is a acid trip, rancid spit
Psychedelic capsules with some packs of shit
Vodka and ayahuasca to capture a glimpse of ecstacy
You won't need a tiny pill in this bitch
Now overdose over the doses prescribed for Doc Nova
The pot smoker, too high to be sober
I bleed smoke, my weed smoke is keef-soaked
Then re-broke, then re-rolled
Enough to make three choke
One pass out, two re-smoke
When all's gone we re-roachin it, re-toast
We boast about that kush we roast, best gross
Top dollar, top of the chart, that's the West Coast
If I ain't high then I musta just woke up
I stay high into the moon till the sun rose up
Then I made clouds appear, the gas is massive
I'll clash your gastric, smash your glasses
Back from the ashes spread like rashes flashes
That man to man this be a classic
With new cuts, fuck that
Gashes active, you are now inactive
Bastards bend your back, it's action
Double G

[ VERSE 2: The Alchemist ]
Mix the vodka with the ayahuasca
Indian shaman, the witchdoctor
Leave your whole body stoned like Jimmy Hoffa
No stoppa
Cause once I go under water I go lower than Davy Jones' locker
Double G's a showstopper
Headbanger, the dome rocker
Fix your noodle like pasta fagioli
The one and only Gang bacteria
So quarantine the immediate area
And it only gets scarier
Aerial attack, mosquito malaria
There's no sparin ya
Don't procrastinate, I'll assassinate your character
Palm a Derringer, 'Shoot to Kill' like Tom Berenger
Yeah if I ain't high I'm not woke
Still dreamin, still flyin through clouds of pot smoke
Blunt steamin, marihuana mixed with brocco
Places you can not go, waffle or birds like Roscoe's
What you expect, though? It's a psychedelic expo
What I'm poppin is not a Mentos
So tune in and drop out and let the best flow
Ballistic on the tempo
Madman Mike, Dr. Demento
Alan The Chemist fill up the jars, now it's replenished
Mix the dimethyltryptamine with the Guinness
Double G Society's Menace
OX tenants, hell up in Venice
Time for me to handle my biz
Hide women and kids
It's Double G
