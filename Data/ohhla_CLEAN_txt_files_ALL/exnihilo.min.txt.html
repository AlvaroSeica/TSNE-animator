Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Yea, who woulda thought I'd step inside this train station
then get hit with some inspiration? It's amazin
the most beautiful pieces of art come from the ugliest situations
So I praise Him, rejoicin in my sufferin cause I know
He's got a masterpiece in the makin
and I ain't scared of death nor Satan
cause I know who's hand that my name is engraved in
this right here is a proper statement
I am not the artist, I'm the canvas that He's paintin
like I remember last year bein homeless
sleepin on the air mattress, but on the phone with
three record labels, who to go with? I notice
you like to fix things with them tools that are broken
so when them dark nights hit his soul
I know enough to know to trust you with what I don't

Bad days, I suppose, too much for me to remember
let me back up, I'm too close, now I can see the whole picture
you make somethin out of nothin, nothin
you make somethin out of nothin, nothin

Sittin back meditatin on creation
thinkin how you made everything out of nathan
what a statement, you sustain it
let there be, and there is, my brain can't contain this
that's why the fame and the claim is so dangerous
it'll make a heart sing that my name is the greatest
so, Josh, Rich, Ray, Alex, De
call me to repentance if I ever go astray
if that money ever get in the way, then I'll burn it
the price for my soul is something I couldn't pay
sometimes I read them articles believin what they say
sweatin my own press, God is so unimpressed
nah, I'm a mess, made out of dust
to return to it upon death, my soul rests, and yet
they makin heroes out of the ones who been rescued
who cares if they remember my name if I forget you?

Bad days, I suppose, too much for me to remember
let me back up, I'm too close, now I can see the whole picture
you make somethin out of nothin, nothin
you make somethin out of nothin, nothin

[Christon Gray]
Your egos nothin
I'm nothin much, but He knows somethin, Exnihilo
He's next to zero
He leans on nothin and nothin I want more than hear those trumpets
no nothin I want more than to hear those trumpets
my earlobes jumpin I feel so love sick
lot of us got ideas but still no substance
and a lot of times I can see it but the mirror don't love Chris

Bad days, I suppose, too much for me to remember
let me back up, I'm too close, now I can see the whole picture
you make somethin out of nothin, nothin
you make somethin out of nothin, nothin</pre>
