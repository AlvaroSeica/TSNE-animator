Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
Baby open up your legs
Let me open 'em up
Baby open up your legs for me
Let me open 'em up
If it smells real good
I'm a show you where the loves at
Bend over
Put your pussy
Where my tongue's at
Put your pussy
Where my tongue's at
Put your pussy
Where my tongue's at

[Verse 1]
Baby it's gon' feel good
Let me touch your body
Have you ever been fucked
Inside a maserati?
It don't matter where they from
They loving my stilo
If I fucked 'em already
Pass her to my homie beto
It should be illegal
How I pass 'em around
Make her go downtown
Then make it rain in her mouth
(ew you made it rain in her mouth?)
White rain in her mouth
Yeah I'm laying it down
Got no train tracks
But had a train in my house
I hit just a lil
Got brain then I bounced
I got brain then I bounce
I hit it in the d house
Then to the p house

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
There you go fucking up
Puttin' shit on myspace
Tellin' all your fucken friends
We was on a hot date
It wasn't no hot date
Cause we did it my way
Turn around bend over
Now you do what I say
Goddamn it feels good
Oh shit it feels good
Booty bouncin' everywhere
Fuck yeah I had to look
Gettin' hyphy in this bitch
Baby got me going dumb
I love bitches with boyfriends
Cause bitches with boyfriends
Don't give me no drama
I'm out in the hood
Homie we hustlin' hard
Bitches wanna fuck
With a street rap star

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Your 2 sisters
I even fuck your ex-bitch
This is the reason
Why muthafuckas hate sick
I'm in a grey whip
This ain't the same bitch
My bitches look a like
Same body same lips
I made a song
You could call me to fuck
I didn't think that she would
But now she's calling me up
Bumping r. kelly
While I'm tearin' it up
Fucking rough with a passion
Until I busted a nut
2 days later
We was going back at it
She said do you eat pussy?
And I just laughed at it
Okay
Well let me put my fingers in it
If it smells real good
Then fuck it I'm a lick it

[Chorus]</pre>
