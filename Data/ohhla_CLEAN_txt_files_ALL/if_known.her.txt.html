[MC Magic]
Magic
Uh
NB Ridaz (Only if I'd know)
With the homie Marcos
Yeah (I know)
Come on (How much you love me and I loved you)

Chorus: Marcos Hernandez
If I only did then
What I'd now know, we would
Have kids
A home of our own
What I did
What I didn't sure couldn't
Get you
To stay
If I only did then
What I'd now know, I'd be
With you
Until we grow old, sayin'
Love you
Never let you go, but
Only, if, I'd, know

[Main Verse: Marcos Hernandez (MC Magic in background)]
It was late that night
It, wasn't right to
Do what I did to
For some fight, I
Need to say okay
I'm sorry for being mad at you, same way I (Sorry, baby)
Crossed the line with you, and (Oooh wee)
Pushed your buttons when I wasn't supposed to
So what can I do? (What can I do, baby?)
I don't wanna lose you (Come on)

Hook: Marcos Hernandez
Your pain
Your hurt, it's
My rage
My burn, it's
Insane
I've learn from
Mistakes
I made from love
So long
Since I have
Seen you
Need to be
With you
So I will
Do what you want me to

Repeat Chorus

[Rap Verse: MC Magic (Marcos Hernandez in background)]
I wish I would've known how you felt about things (Yeah, yeah)
I must have just forgotten what you really mean to me (Mean to me)
It's been so quiet
And lonely in this place
I need to hear that you miss me
And that you're coming home today

Bridge: Marcos Hernandez
I miss, your lips, your touch, like
The flowers miss the sun
It's cloudy on me
Oh, please
Take this cute's away from me

Repeat Hook &amp; Chorus Twice</pre>
