Typed by: Lil Hustle 

(*talking*) 
Ok, understand me not you but me 
This is another S.U.C. classic 
Dedicated to all the fallen soldiers 
And all the real slab riders of the south mayn, holla back 

[Chorus] 
Know I'm candy red, I'm on the scene 
But jump in, sipping codeine 
Boys know, I'm candy red I'm on the scene 
But jump in, sipping codeine 
Know I'm candy red, I'm on the scene 
But jump in, sipping codeine 
Know I'm candy red, know I'm candy red 
Sipping codeine, sipping codeine 

[Lil' Keke] 
Apple red brandy wine, California dream boat 
It's super nice I sprayed it twice, I swear I got a mean coat 
Pull up on the scene hot, can't forget my cream top 
I'm down in Houston Texas, where them gangstas live they dreams out 
S.U.C. another year, drinking like it's Screw in here 
We tipping broads and sipping oil, I'm trying to make myself clear 
Boys gotta see me, on the scene 
They say that Young Don, keep that motherfucker clean 
I'm out here like a king, candy on the car 
We on them double cups, and drinking green labeled bar 
That bloody blunt that sticky one, they taught me how to hold 
I tear the lane and do my thang, that young nigga cold Don Ke 

[Chorus] 

[Mike D] 
Boys don't know, they shouldn't of never let the hog loose 
Fo' do' panorama, stretched out the Porsche coupe 
Red turn heads, but I come through in that black thang 
Lincoln on Porillas, they thinking I'm Fat Pat mayn 
Body rock the K, and bounce and turn through the Tre 
Having it my way, I ball sunny or grey 
Live out the pen, still running them jiggas 
Eight dollars a coozer, still they drank nigga 
Three summers later, only question where the paper 
They talking bout a dropper, Javier owe me a favor 
Peel back the wig, on that old school monster 
Cardier aviators, balling since a youngster 
Tapping on that iPad, yapping on that iPhone 
Cup full of Big Moe, kush got my mind gone 
Yeah, I say that kush got my mind blown 
Hand the game over, cause the motherfucking hog home 

[Chorus] 

[Big Pokey] 
Candy red top cracked, 45 cocked back 
That lean giving niggaz the bidness, bitch I'm about that 
Hating y'all could stop that, I'm cleaner than a motherfucker 
Crawling up the strip, fifth leaning like a motherfucker 
Ay, hell yeah I brought my swag with me 
Bank roll bad bitch, in the Jag with me 
Head turner, when you see me in the street 
Pulling up in some'ing exotic, with sneakers on the seat 
Swell it up, sew the wall I hit em 
Smash the petal to the flo', watch this motherfucker get em 
I pull up on the scene, now the whip looking mean 
Skinny waxed it I'm in traffic, got the whip looking clean yeah 

[Chorus]</pre>
