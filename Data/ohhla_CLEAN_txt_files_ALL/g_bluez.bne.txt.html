[Chorus]
Ghetto blues has got me down for the the last time

[Verse 1]
Strapped down with ghetto ways
Beggin' me to the extent of my struggles statis
They called me on the low
Comin' up on the money
Hustle, the same old thang for a new game to be played for cheese
Gotta get what's promised to a sister, comin' up on bankin' G's
Hustlin's all the same
I can't deal with these playas' thoughts
Too much trust and risks make quick for a fool to get caught
Hold on, slippin', too late to be trippin'
Weak strategies gettin' the best of me
Underpriced, everyday down and out is life in societies
Still, I hold on, 'cause I'm headstrong
And focus with life of no time to pay the price of failure
Let me tell you, no lie
Livin' by the strugglers' rules
Gotta do what ya gotta do that's fit
We strugglin', who gives a damn man bout this down and out chick?
My head poundin', what am I gonna do?
Gotta get on the hustle
makin' the cheese comin' up out of the low-life of the ghetto
Gotta make this come up on the real, since tired of strugglin'
Ghetto life showin' me no love
But givin' me reason to make quick moves on somethin'
Gotta hold on my own, but it's hard as hell
Tryin' to stay afloat in "The Heart of it All"
So for myself, it's the way I go
I gotta do what gotta be done to make it in these hard times
Strugglin's a mother when you gotta wonder
"Can I provide for mine?"
Look at my predicament, who's gonna help this sister in need?
Can't put the trust in the system
So I gotta hustle these streets for my cheese
Gotta make that money comin' up on the means that's due
Cause one of these '96 days, I'm outta these ghetto blues

[Chorus]
Ghetto blues has got me down for the the last time

[Verse 2]
These ghetto blues done gotta sista faded
Prayed this was only a dream
Trapped in a slum surrounded by the crack fiends
Means of survival, I guess
Hustle in the hood, wear the bulletproof vest
Help me, Lord, I can't get no deeper than this
Wish I wasn't born in this world of bastards, misfits
Mom's got love for me, but she don't love what I do [ohh]
Gotta slang 9 to 5, don't bring in enough food
Steadily, look out for myself, my trues, and my family
See gotta go for self cause won't nobody take care of me
Strategy, keep fools out of my place gotta take care of my business
What is this?
II Tru, Playa hatas on the real, you betta get with this
Been down for too long
Come strong, fool, it's on
AJay's click comin' thick for the nine-six
Right down to the very bone, never laggin'
Eighty-six ghetto life, Eighty-six them ghetto blues
Trues comin' up for the nine-six
Playa hatas, you bound to lose
Break rules, ain't no laws here, playa
Understand ghetto blues, cause for moves testin' trues
But remember the man
Go home if you sensitive, gotta live, nothin' gives
Been in some strange situations
Comprehend since I had to do, so a sista did
Get rid of all excesses, always stay true to my trues
I can do this
Gotta shake these problems, get away from these ghetto blues

[Chorus]
Ghetto blues has got me down for the the last time

[Verse 3]
Right now
Time to get a nigga shit tight with the man in the mirror
See clear through the rest of my days on earth
Been piecin' puzzle since birth
And it only get worst until we layin' in the hearse
It's a ghetto curse
Every little kid in the hood done felt these tortures
Departure up out of this hell hole, nigga done fell low
Stressed, but I'm blessed as a soldier
I beg of you
Lord Jesus, help me deliver myself and my click from this evil
Fear the reeper surround in' my soul
Steadily sendin' these through my peoples
Heaven be takin' control of my destiny
I can't let these streets get the best of me
With all of my kids right next to me
You can expect for me to keep grindin' desperately
Calculatin' my every move
Gotta prove to these fools we confuse
Intention, do your thang and maintain the mission
Cause really, my trues can't settle for no prison sentence
So, I keep my distance from llello
Plottin, starin' out the window, looking for a rainbow
Lay Bone can't settle for the same 'ole
Claim Mo Thug with love to the depth that the game goes
Reviewing all possiblities, pesponsibilities is major now
Ain't no need on dwellin' where the danger bound
Shit'll change around if we make it, suit up
Two glocks for the war, check the score
II Tru can't lose, 'cause you know we got shit to prove
Gotta stick for you, livin' our lives
Singin' these ghetto blues [blues]

[Chorus]
Ghetto blues has got me down for the the last time</pre>
