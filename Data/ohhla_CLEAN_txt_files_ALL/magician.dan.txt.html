Typed by: AZ Lyrics

It's tragic; you tried to cut yourself in half
But this isn't magic; in fact it's something much more dark, or more dramatic
Self harm, that's what they call it
Cause it just affects you
It's your life, your body, so you can choose what you do
And if one day you can't rein it in
And of your last breath you are the only witness
Then so be it, cause it's your last breath
And it's nobody else's business
But, how about your little sister?
I mean, you think your life's been bad
And by no means am I belittling that
Cause I know the troubles you've had
But a teen finding out her big sister chose death over life
Finding out instead of turning to her with your problems, you turned to a knife
That's a whole lot of pain to deal with
And a whole lot of damage
And the only role model she has is little more than words engraved in granite
But as you said before, this just affects you
It's your life, your body, so you can choose what you do
And if one day you can't rein it in
And of your last breath you are the only witness
Then so be it, cause it's your last breath
And it's nobody else's business
But then, how about your parents?
God knows they've done all they can to support
Yeah, you didn't go up in a mansion
But they gave you the best life they could afford
And the second that last bit of life tickles out
and your lungs cease to breath
They've fail the most important task that they will ever receive
They failed to give their child a life that's worth living
And that's a failure as long as they live, of themselves, is unforgiving
But as you said before, this just affects you
It's your life, your body, so you can choose what you do
And if one day you can't rein it in
And of your last breath you are the only witness
Then so be it, 'cause it's your last breath
And it's nobody else's business
But, how about your friends?
How did they fail to see this coming?
I mean, you can only hold so much pain
And recently it seems like the tap's been left running
Families grow distant, but it's meant to be your friends you can rely on
They shouldn't be there for just fun and drinks
They should be the shoulder to cry on
They should be the ones you turn to
When you can't talk to your family
But they failed to because although you didn't ask for their support
It should have been mandatory
But as you said before, this just affects you
It's your life, your body, so you can choose what you do
And if one day you can't rein it in
And of your last breath you are the only witness
Then so be it, 'cause it's your last breath
And it's nobody else's business
But then, what about me?
What kind of boyfriend am I?
Instead of living a life I was a big part of
You would rather die
Instead of fighting though together
And turning things around
You decided the grass is greener
On the other side of the ground
Of our shared lives there was nothing worth living for as far as you could see
So if that's the case for you
Then what is there left in this life for me?
But as you said before, this just affects you
It's your life, your body, your sister, your parents, your friends, and your partner
So you can choose what you do
And if one day you can't rein it in
And of your last breath you are the only witness
Then fuck everybody else cause that ain't something youÄôve got to live with
The magician's assistant
Too many problems to list them
Not enough people to listen
The magician's assistant...
