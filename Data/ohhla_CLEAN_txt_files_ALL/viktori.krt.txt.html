[Intro: Big K.R.I.T.]
At the end of the day these niggas don't give a fuck shawty, you feel me?
I've been doing this shit man since '05 my nigga, I just touched down
Representing that Mississippi shit
Man I swear they don't give me a shot cause of that shit
Me, I'm countrier than a motherfucker, but my lyrical content is crazy
I'm making my own beats, what the fuck?!

[Big K.R.I.T.]
They like, Krizzle what you gonna be if balling all they wanna see?
The car, the clothes, the hoes, the Chevy do's that fall like angel wings
(All of that been done befo') but I'ma keep it simple
Put my voice up on a track until it come back monumental
Fuck a hater (I was greater) nominated since a youngun
out the womb, I was groomed to be the ruler over something
It was nothing to be better (yeah), always on they level
They was hating, they was scared cause they reign ain't forever
They've been hearing bout me lately, wondering what I'm doing
They've been napping, I've been vicking for the spot I've been pursuing
Ain't no losing where I'm coming from (ain't no going back)
Ain't no looking down (only looking round) where they at?
Where they going when I get here, I can't figure out
If you ain't a bank teller nigga, what you talking bout?
(Tell 'em K.R.I.T.) Telling it for years, they've been boring us, ignoring us
My climb to the top will be glorious, viktorious

[Interlude: Big K.R.I.T.]
Now I ain't got no animosity to these niggas coming out, y'knahmean?
At the end of the day I want to see a nigga get money
But you can't tell me Mississippi had a run
Not like Texas, not like Florida
Not like Memphis, not like Louisiana, not like Atlanta
Hey, Alabama did they thang, come on shawty
It all boils down to we got something to say, you feel me?

[Big K.R.I.T.]
They like, Krizzle what you gonna say when all the cameras in your face
about the 'Sip and David Banner, and what it means to take his place
(Take a stand) Do all that I can to get off the block
Misinterpret what I say (now they think I'm taking shots)
On the low it gave a nigga hope, that's just what it is
I don't need a nigga vouching for me, that's just how I feel
Never had (never ever been) and I never will
Mississippi never had a run (let's just keep it real)
Not like all these other states, Texas had 'em swanging down
Rich Boy "Threw Some D's" on it, Alabama certified
Florida been outta there (Louisiana keep it trill)
Lil Wayne do his thang (kush and bud crazy where I live)
Memphis Tenn', Yo Gotti, Three 6, Ball &amp; MJ'
Atlanta still the Mecca, artists blowing out chere every day
(Tell 'em K.R.I.T.) Tell 'em that for years they aborted us, ignoring us
My story will be glorious, viktorious</pre>
