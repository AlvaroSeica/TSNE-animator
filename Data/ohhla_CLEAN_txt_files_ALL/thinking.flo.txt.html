[Intro/Chorus: Flo Rida]
But it hurts to think
You're somewhere on a search for me
I'm right here with no words to speak
Daydreamin about what could never be, it will never be
But I wonder do you think of me? Do you think of me?
Cause I'm thinkin of

[Flo Rida]
All I wanted was to keep this love alive (yeah)
And all I wanted is to be there by your side (yeah, yeah)
I know better girl to keep on tellin lies
Should have swallowed my pride, but I think sometimes
Baby it was best it was best, it was best that we let it go
Baby it was best it was best, it was best that we let it go

[Chorus]

[repeat 2X]
Baby it was best it was best, it was best that we let it go

[Flo Rida]
I think it's best that we let it go
No stress than the mess we was headed fo'
Cause only trouble had vision in the telescope
A peace of mind better than Mission Impossible, ooh and unpossible
I take a bird in the hand if it's toucan
But who can't play the spot? Get a new van
Rockin wit'chu get it poppin wit'chu when them guys a hit'chu
I don't wanna say I shoulda coulda woulda bud
And he ain't right his mind, wanna keep a grudge
Let it fly, kid you ain't never seen a dub
Dancin over troubled waters, poppa's daughter
Rolling stone, she can't hide under Louis clutch
The bigger man when I look up at her pretty much
Another chance that I dance on it like a butt
Just hit the gas and I mash on it to the club
I think it's best it was best we split up

[repeat 2X]
Baby it was best it was best, it was best that we let it go

[Chorus]

[repeat 2X]
Baby it was best it was best, it was best that we let it go

[Flo Rida]
And~! All I ever wanted was a good girl
Good girls come and then I gotta tell her lil' girl
Shorty, lil' momma, is harnessin the drummer
I know I ain't a saint but I still believe in karma
I'm gon' try to keep my shit together
But yeah I know what is the reason what the hell I tell her?
Hello, good morning, I was out for my 34th birthday
But that excuse'll never have me comin home late
You straight? I'm straight, I don't wanna deal with it
If she told me that a couple times I'ma live with it
No yo, let me know I might 'ccomplish it
That's when you know you got the rope around your neck
Itchin, scratchin, chokin, whatever
Hangin from the tree the next time I'll know better
Face tattooed, homey shoulda got letters
Dead to her face if I could I'd tell her

[repeat 2X]
Baby it was best it was best, it was best that we let it go

[Chorus]

[repeat 2X]
Baby it was best it was best, it was best that we let it go</pre>
