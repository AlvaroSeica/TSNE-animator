[Intro]
(There ain't nobody else to talk about)
Hey love... you remember your first time? (New Joc City)
Get dat with a real nigga? Heh heh heh (Block Entertainment)
Well let's talk about it (Bad Boy South)

[Chorus: Marques Houston]
It ain't nothin like the first time
I'm tryin to tell you I can blow your mind
Baby if I touch you here, and kiss you there
Gonna fall in love shorty best beware
There ain't nothin like the first time
I'm tryin to tell you I can blow your mind
Baby if I touch you here, and kiss you there
Gonna fall in love shorty you best beware

[Verse One]
Ah hold on this ain't no love song, mo' like a cut song
You say your day was long, well tell daddy what's wrong
I'ma tell ya one time, just relax and unwind
Whisper sweet nothings now you're blushin chills down your spine
Oh yeah you hot and tempted, oh no not Pretty Rickie
But when you _Grind on Me_, I'ma leave you hot and trippin
Just slip in them satin sheets, now go on and roll over
Oh yeah it's up and down motions like a roller coaster
I see you up on top, you all on my "Joc"
I'ma do it non-stop (stop) until yo' cherry pop (cherry pop)
I'ma keep goin and goin, the Energizer Bunny
Mister Long John all in your tummy

[Chorus]

[Verse Two]
Won't ya let me introduce ya, to thug Kama Sutra
This ain't no lovey dovey (nah) but watch how I seduce ya
Girl I'm the man, I-I-I'm the man (I'm the man)
I push the right buttons and there's sex on demand
Oh yeah I like it slow (like it slow) baby be easy (be easy)
Ooh watch your teeth (watch your teeth) baby be easy
Tell me yo' Vicky Secrets, tell me all the dirt (dirty)
You smell like peaches, must be Bath &amp; Body Works
Love the way yo' body work (body work) I'ma make yo' body rock (body rock)
Once you climax (climax) you feel the aftershock (aftershock)

[Marques Houston]
I know I got'cha hooked on this lovin
Dont get it twisted, we just cuttin baby!

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
Yeah, I know I know, I still ain't went soft
But I gotta go let's hit the shower baby, it's time to rinse off
I'll wash yours, you wash mine, I'll adore it the first time
I blew yours, you blew mine, sometimes I'll drop you a line
But look, don't tell nobody (nobody) keep it on the low (low)
Not yo' best friend, not yo' cousin, nobody's gotta know
I know it sounds crazy (crazy) but that's just how it is (is)
Yung J-O-C, long live, long live

[Chorus]

[Outro: Joc] + (Houston)
(M.H. and Joc, shorty we gon' give it to ya)
Mm-hmm, yeah I know y'all wasn't expectin that
(M.H. and Joc, shorty we gon' give it to ya girrrl)
Welcome to "New Joc City"
(Heyyy, ohhhhh! Ohhh baby)
Goodnight</pre>
