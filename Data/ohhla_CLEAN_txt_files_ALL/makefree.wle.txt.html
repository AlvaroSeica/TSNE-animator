Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I'm ballin ay [x4]
We ballin ay [x7]

I'm a make it rain
Straight shots, don't toast champagne
AKOD a lil bit a change
And these broads all know my name
Hol up
I'm a make it rain
Straight shots, don't toast champagne
Magic city a lil bit a change
And these broads all know my name
Let's get it crack
One time DC where the city at
If she give it to me now
She goin give it back
I'm a needa know now, can a brotha crack?
Or a brotha gota roll like a brotha act
I'm foolish shawty
I just wana know can we do this shawty?
Flower bomb on you and shawty
And I can be ya hole inta ya lips shawty
I'm a make it rain trick
This a lil change trick
Henny got me spinning like a fuckin hurricane kick
DC PG where I be
L-O-U-D air I breathe
She like me from that no hands but
I'm a need her to use no teeth
I ont know you chick, you ont know me
Baby I'm a dawg, tell them hoes all flee
Hot whip something cold on my feet
This is not somethin that I wrote for the Queens
You just do ya thing chick
I'm a letchu hang chick
She said she a magic city
Then I'm David Blane bitch
