[Intro]
SAY~!!! {*2X*}

[Chorus: Santigold]
Louder than they {*3X*}
Allow, allow
Louder than they {*3X*}
Allow, allow
Say ahaaaaa, ahaaaaa {*2X*}

[Santigold]
At night, it's eatin up your head backed against the wall
Got you in, a tight place though you're not alone at all
Been fightin, tryin to place a name on what it's called
Made you feel like a losin streak cause you know but you're not involved

[Chorus]

[Santigold]
It's all right cause everything they say doesn't make no sense
It's that time, I'm pickin up my ass up from off the fence
Gonna blow, a hole in this charade it's self defense
I'm a army, got a whole brigade in my two sense

[Chorus]

[Santigold]
Send in your torpedoes for all they know
Make a show shake them up, before you blow
Cause they don't want no cure
No, you'd better find a way, cause their aim's not pure

[Chorus]

[Outro]
SAY~!!! {*2X*}</pre>
