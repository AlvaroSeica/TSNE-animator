(*talking*)
Yeah yeah we in here mayn, Rasaq boy
Northside forever, ay ay

[Rasaq]
They say I'm like a match box, nigga cause I got that heat
All I need's a solid beat, I promise you won't fall asleep
If you talking bout a G, partna all that talk is cheap
All I talk about is cheese, and everytime you talk it's sweet
I hear you talking, I don't need a peace offering
If you want the peace, the piece is all I'm offering
Y'all boys softer than, the q-tip of cotton
I got two chicks two whips, and two bottle popping
Came from the gutter, instead of saying I'm capping
Take it as a celebration, this was never meant to happen
While niggaz stay chilling, I promise I'm paper stacking
You haters just keep on yapping, I'm creeping up from the back end
Shoot the pistol first, no time for question asking
Most of y'all love me, some hating me with a passion
On my grind mashing, you softer than mashed potatoes
When I spit a sixteen on a track, I'm the greatest
Been on hiatus, these labels use to degrade us
Now the money's major nigga, so how you gon try to play us
I don't need no favors, my flow's sharper than razors
And I shock everybody, like them laws with them tazers
Waves in my taper, I'm a I-10 scraper
Money chaser for the paper, I be poof like a vapor
Playa get your weight up, you faking then you was made up
I was layed up on the leather, yeah I'm trying to get my pay up
I can't even lie homie, I got's to keep it trill
Only mess with real niggaz, 50/50 what's the deal
You know how I feel, if it ain't about a bill
Then it prolly won't appeal, partna stop and close your grill boy</pre>
