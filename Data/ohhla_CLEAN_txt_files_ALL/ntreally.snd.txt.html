People ask me if my life changed
Here's what I might say -
Not really
Not really

Just ran alongside a river in eastern Europe
Instead of 'round the lake at Flushing Park
Similar scenario
Same cardio
Top billing at long last
I be chilling in first class
I was chilling in economy
That didn't bother me
I meet a lot more women
Having about the same amount of sex
Still a major shortage of cool ones
Shit, probably even less
Hard to keep a low pro at Whole Foods
It was hard to keep a low pro in homeroom
That shit is old news
So

When people ask me if my life changed
Here's what I might say -
Not really
Not really

Far as money I was always out
Now it's always money coming in
I never worry about money now
I never worried about money then
I still don't let nothing go to waste
Leftovers any given day
I spend about the same
There's just a lot more left over to give away
It occurred to me one show
I'm on stage where I used to be in the front row 
That's like a ten foot distance
It's not a real big difference
Same guidelines as far as being the bigger man
Staying away from the yellow snow
I'm still Black Thought's biggest fan
Just now I can call and tell him so

So people ask me if my life changed
Here's what I might say -
Not really
Not really

Folks make a lotta fuss
I got a lotta buzz
I still could be a bust
Same as it ever was
ClearChannel FM
Can kiss my asscheek
I said that last year
I said that last week
Same world, peeps
Even the same words, peep
I've always kept it real
That's why I'm earning some real keep
Same pants, different crease
Same pan, different grease
Same Sand, different beach
Peace

So people ask me if my life changed
Here's what I might say -
Not really
