[Intro]
I'm a take my time, all I need is 30 seconds man 
30 seconds to you but it can change my life 
I'll tell you anything man I'm a Brooklyn nigga 
Aiyyo Kendrick! Good look on that Summerjam move 
But you ain't the king of shit!!! 
 
[Verse One]
Tell Kendrick and T.D.E. they need to lay off them PCP's 
Far from the king, this is the city of B.D.P. 
You'll never be a real west coast artist like Eazy E 
You a fuckin joke we laugh at you like hee hee hee 
Y'all probably stick dildos in each other like Stevie G 
I mean Stevie J on that sex tape with E.V.E. 
Little Sean Big Sean, let me see I.D. 
Before you rap why you always say B.I.G.?! 
You ain't Biggie you ain't D,I,E, 
Everytime I hear you your gettin cornea like your E.Y.E. 
Bck when we was slaves they used to cut off our balls 
Then stuffed 'em in our mouths kept us away from the girls 
Modern day slavery, now they put us in jail 
A bunch of men in cells away from the females 
This wasn't done just because the color of skin 
This was done 'cause they never wanted us to be men 
Kendrick, Kanye, Drake, they all act feminine 
Wear alot of clothes you usually see women in 
So the mainstream america finds it interestin 
Push 'em to the forefront they positionin 
You never made it 'cause you brinigin lyrics in 
Singin like a lady you get away with murder you George Zimmerman 
What I'm statin is facts, grams 
You only blew up 'cause you contributed to the feminization of the black man 
Wolves on you, time to get rid of these crab rappers 
Wolfpack on your back you really a backpacker 
Kendrick Lamar where's your last name rap bastard?! 
You got two first names your mama was ass backwards</pre>
