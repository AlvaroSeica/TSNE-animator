[Lew Hawk]
Yea, I'm thinkin about putting 20's on a cab
and pickin up more hoes than a WNBA draft
yea I'm thinking I'm 7:30
yea I'm fly as a muthafucka
Yea I'm thinking about buying my own Astrodome
the Lew Hawk Dome,
I'm thinking about putting my face on Hundred dollar bills
I'm thinking what the fuck do this boy got up in his suite
cause I'm zero tolerence on the premo glass
I'm not even trippin like that I'm thinkin O
I'm thinkin about taking this deep freeze off my neck
this ice tray out my mouth, I'm thinkin about keepin my pockets fatter
than mother loves big ass
I'm thinking about, yea know what I'm talkin bout

[Paul Wall]
Peek-A-Boo my mouth is a picture so
ice glow from the tip to the lip below
I'm thinkin 3 carrots on every tooth
TV's fallen so heavy
left a dent in my roof
to tell you the truth
Chamillionaires better than me
his flip-flop shines a little bit wetter than me
but it dont matter
we both on the same team
I'm thinkin thoed and I know we think the same thing
I chop the block like circumcision
looking at my chain to hard 'll hurt ya vision
steppin into my garage
should be worth admission
I got deep dishes
just like if I worked in the kitchen
I'm thinkin paint that change everytime ya blink
My rims are 23's so they old enough to drank
I dont like dinosuars or Jurassic Park
but the rims sure look Jurassic when I Park
where I live resembles an enourmouse mall
I got green like the lettuce that a farmer haul
Paint shine Like i waxed it with armor-all
I'm thinkin Golf Cart with the Alarm install
trunk turn and flips
people think I teach gymnastics
I'm throwed like a fast ball from Greg Maddox
I'm thinkin Louie Vatone or some Reebox Classics
cause my stretch kinda similar to elastic

[Chorus]
I'm thoed, thoed, thoed
thinkin thoed, thinkin bout how ima get this doe
so we roll, roll, roll
stack our fold even if we gotta step on toes
then it grows, grows, grows
when it grows money doubles then we go get mo
I dont know, know, know
I dont know but they havent been told

[Chamillionaire]
Uh, listen I'm thinkin
Knock, knock, who is it? Mr. here Lizard, Lizard
Got 23's like we watchin them Washington Wizards
I'm thinkin pullin so many cars out the garage
that the city will build a freeway that ends in my yard
I'm keeping big face people
in the safe or the wallet
so that man Uncle Sam cant jock my deposit
hold up Paul I'm impressed
I thought you was the best
but you just said I was the best
so its a tie I guess
NBA draft teams wanna recruit us
3-point diamonds man
the lakers couldnt out-shoot us
got them groupies sittin on the gouchie stitchin
and coups be flippin wonderin why the roofs is missin
buy ya ad on the back of a carton of milk
and ask have you seen the roof for the car with stilts
I'm thinkin, the rims get any bigger under the coupe
then ima have to jump out the coupe with a parachute
Spreewell rims on the lawnmower
but dont need to be fast,
cause if I slow up the
rims will keep trimmin the grass
I'm thinkin, car be hooverin
that boy be thuggin in
probally could get Suge Knight for all his publishin
*beep* Its Def Jams and we heard all your tapes
we want to sign you we cant wait
eeewww Message erase
I'm thinkin a label wanna give a deal to chamile and mista madd
they better have an unrecouperable meal

[Chorus]
I'm thoed, thoed, thoed
thinkin thoed, thinkin bout how ima get this doe
so we roll, roll, roll
stack our fold even if we gotta step on toes
then it grows, grows, grows
when it grows money doubles then we go get mo
I dont know, know, know
I dont know but they havent been told
but I'm thinkin thoed

I'm thoed, thoed, thoed
thinkin thoed, thinkin bout how ima get this doe
so we roll, roll, roll
stack our fold even if we gotta step on toes
then it grows, grows, grows
when it grows money doubles then we go get mo
I dont know, know, know
I dont know but they havent been told
but I'm thinkin thoed

[Chorus]
I'm thoed, thoed, thoed
thinkin thoed, thinkin bout how ima get this doe
so we roll, roll, roll
stack our fold even if we gotta step on toes
then it grows, grows, grows
when it grows money doubles then we go get mo</pre>
