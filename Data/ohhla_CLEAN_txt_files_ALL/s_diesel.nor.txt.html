[Intro - also repeat in background]
Now take your two step, now take your two step, now take your two step

[NORE]
Yeah
Hey yo Grease, it's your boy NORE

[Chorus]
We smoking sour, we smoking sour
We smoking sour, we smoking sour
We smoking sour diesel, like everydayyy
We smoking sour, we smoking sour
We smoking sour, we smoking sour
We smoking sour diesel, like everydayyy

[NORE - over Chorus]
Hahahaha
I love that shit!
My neighbors been complaining
The people downstairs from me been complaining
How about that sour, man

[NORE]
Yo, I wake up smoke a diesel, go to sleep smoke a diesel
Change my name to Sour and my last name Diesel
See I, get it in jars and I, sneak it in cars
And I, smoke it in bars, damn you a fiend
Haze came back cause I heard her man beatin on her
Kush ain't mad, when she heard that I was cheatin on her
... Chocolate Thai been cut off
Same category as Henny and Smirnoff
See Phillies is the best, best, diesel is the best, best
Put it all together it help you release stress, stress
Cause I'm a smoker, I'm a smoker, you a smoker, you a smoker
Put it all together, go all-in like poker
And no I don't smoke bongs, that's only for the weirdos
NORE's always good with a half ounce of beers yo
You run and tell the hood, please run and tell the people
That NORE's in the lab with Grease and sour diesel

[Chorus]

[Styles P - over Chorus]
What we doing?
I love sour diesel Grease, that's my shit
Light that up then
Okay!
That's my thing

[Styles P]
Smoke sour every half an hour, 15 minutes
Got a dutch then, put somethin it
And if it's sour buy more than an ounce
Bring it to the studio, or the house, get high on the couch
ESPN on, Animal Planet
Since I blew 20 blunts of diesel, shit I can't understand it
Ain't it evil how the sour diesel can leave you
missin all your shows, nigga thank god for Tivo
What, I keep 10 blunts pre-rolled
Park the car walk down the strip on the G stroll
So let me call my man Grease
I got Styles plus heat, why don't you load up the beat
I be there in a hour, fresher than the shower
Sure feel nice hope the mic got power
Something you can plant and it sure ain't flowers
Grease tell 'em what we doin

[Chorus]

[Interlude]
Now take your two step, now take your two step, now take your two step
Now take your two step, now take your two step, now take your two step

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

[repeat to fade]
Now take your two step, now take your two step, now take your two step</pre>
