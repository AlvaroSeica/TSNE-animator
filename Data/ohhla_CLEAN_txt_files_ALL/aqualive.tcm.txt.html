Let it flow for the old and young and
Goo goo, Gaa gaa, cause all can 
Take in the Agua
The living water
The beverage of the Most High
So let God be true and every man be a lie
But, first let us take a pause to give Honor 
Before we let the Spirit heat it up like a sauna
Oh Susanna, God is Great
Thank you Lord for coming incarnate
And, you are every-thing 
And every-thing Definitely is you, And Ahh-Ohhh!
Word to Shem And Ham And Jepheth
Descendents thereof watch your steppeth
Cause some want you to hateth, and bucketh, and killeth and
won't parley until a lot of blood spillith
But willith thoueth, illeth noweth
And be judged by the ref for the technical fouleth and
Woweth, I guess your really out there brethren
And refuse to remove that eyelid covering
And yo, you need to refocus Geeth
I'm covered in the blood and you still can't seeth
Meeth, and Weeth, and who Christ beeth
Man, Prophet, or the Almightieth
And Time will tell, but as for now you better ease on down
And, ease on down to The Well
Of all you do make this your goal 
quench that thirst deep down in your soul
with The Agua
 
[Chrous]
The Living, the water, the flowing, the flowing, the living the water
Live Agua
[Repeat]
It's Agua Live 
[Repeat]
 
[Tonic]
And, gotta keep coming
Gotta keep slamming
Who's serving God and who's serving mammon
Do you die of famine or do you die of thirst
Well in this context they both be cursed
Cause the water is the bread and the bread is the water
Get a 40 of Christ in your life style order
Giving you more energy than Gatorade
Cause there ain't a sports drink that's eternal made
Yeah, easy on your stomach and no blotation
And No belch, and no burp, and no carbonation
Check out your drink and check the other flavors and
I betcha ain't one that compares with the Savior's and
You drank down drugs and your still need more
Too much wine?, it's coming back up out on the floor, and
You drank down lust and you said yummy yummy
Now there's a live human being growing in your tummy
So will you be a mommy or will you be a mummy
Guzzling down death with the dead and the dummies
Or the fools, is what the Bible calls them
And brothers you can't hide behind the yes, yes, yalls
It's plain And, clear And quenching 
living, water, flowing, so act like you know And
Ask the Savior for a big ole cup 
and just, Drink, Drink, Drink, Drink, Drink it up
 
[Chorus] 
 
[Tonic]
Don't need no ice, no sugar, no blender
No Jordan, No Jackson, No Lou Alcinder
Cause the, Spirit of God will endorse it
The Everlasting Spring, the Forever and ever faucet
Won't slur your speech, won't blur your sight
Cause He's real filling and yet He's real light
So check it:  So Tonight, Tonight
Just let Him be better than Coke 
Cause He's the real thing
Learn about the real Always
Before you sing
If you looking to Christ saying, "Save me, Save me"
Then you got the right one, Baby!
So when the taste test is through, in the review
Some will say, "I like the Christ in you."
And you can sit back like a super duper Star
And just say, "AH!"
 
[Chorus]
 
[Outro]
We praise Him in Hip-Hop, Meringue, Salsa
If you doing some evil, nasty Lambada
You drinking devil juice, instead of Live Agua</pre>
