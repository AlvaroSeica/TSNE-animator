[sample]
Ooh, ahh, ooooh, yeahhhhh, free.... I said...
Ooh, ahh, ooooh, yeahhhhh, free....

[Cno Evil]
How would it feel to be in danger to take a pace?
Once false movement; explode all over the fucking place
Race don't mean shit in war, red blood on every face
And all the bodies there, get put in the same place
I taste victory, I can never swallow defeat
Militant, gang warfare, rags around our feet
I hold the blood, sweat and tears with my bandana
Til my flesh getting peeled off like a banana
How could it be we get sent out and take orders
Bush is like a child, playing with green plastic soldiers
Crossing enemy borders, tasting the dirty waters
Just so your fathers can be stamped on your quarters
Fuck that, my face should be on your dollar bill
I'm the muthafucka that got the enemies killed
So that currency, can be put in your treasury
Instead it gets stamped on your tombstone; 'In Memory'

[Chorus: Cno Evil (Li-Mouse)]
Relax, and sit back for a minute
Think and realize, all the things that you witnessed
Be grateful, for the state of life that you living
You don't want it no other way, so stop bitching
(Relax, and sit back for a minute
Think and realize, all the things that you witnessed
Be grateful, for the state of life that you living
You don't want it no other way, so stop bitching)

[Li-Mouse]
Torn bodies, my soul undamaged
Slay hundreds with injuries, present but I manage
Stand alone in the yard, the smoke never clears
Bodies lay at my feet, the loved one shed tears
Life valuable to most, but worthless to some
Those with no clue, don't deserve to have one
Fatigue in my legs, my arms exhausted
Severed their heads, so they wouldn't know they lost it
What's this noise, am I, going crazy?
Sounds if the Gods couldn't even save me
Creator of many fatherless babies, I walk lazy
Hands bloody but it don't even phase me
The blade cries in the wind, the strike is fatal
Each swing is a sin, so don't rock the cradle
Big boy games, not made by Bandai
I walk with honor, The Way of the Samurai

[Chorus]</pre>
