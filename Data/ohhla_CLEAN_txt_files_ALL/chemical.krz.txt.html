Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I'm only happy when I'm drinking
Cause sometimes life is just too hard
The chemical kills what I'm thinking
I end up right back where I start, oh
This is not my for-real life (life)

It's the chemical, it's the chemical
The chemical, it won't let me go (I like it)
The chemical (I love it), it won't let me go (I hate it)
Let me go, we're almost there
No we're not

Can only fly, if I'm high
The chemical it gets me by
If I don't scream that means I'm fine
I can't leave the chemical behind
Take me!

It's the chemical, it's the chemical
The chemical, it won't let me go (I like it)
The chemical (I love it), it won't let me go (I hate it)
Let me go, we're almost there
No we're not

You? Who me?
Must be crazy
Should not take this for my safety
Chemical kills, what little pills?
I can't seem to keep myself still

It's the chemical, it's the chemical
The chemical, it won't let me go (I like it)
The chemical (I love it), it won't let me go (I hate it)
Let me go, we're almost there
No we're not</pre>
