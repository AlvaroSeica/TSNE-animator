[2X]
Fuckin' posers
It's almost over now
It's almost over now
Yeah

[Verse]
You think the way you live is okay
You think posing will save your day
You think we don't see that you're running
Better call your boys cause I'm coming

[Chorus]
You can't be me, I'm a Rock Star
I'm rhyming on the top of a cop car
I'm a rebel and my .44 pops far
IT'S ALMOST OVER NOW IT'S ALMOST OVER NOW
Guess, you ain't heard that we swallow guys
It's too damn late ,to apologize
When you see the mantle or when you see the skies
IT'S ALMOST OVER NOW IT'S ALMOST OVER NOW

[Verse]
You think that you don't have to ever quit
You think that you can get away with it
You think the light won't be ever lit
It's almost over now, almost over now
Something's on your chest better get it off
There'll be no one left when we set it off
We ain't gonna take it no more
Since it's almost over now, almost over now

You have to plenty of time, there was no rush
But it was your dream to be like us
You're in dreamland so you don't care
And as you wake I'm standing there

[Chorus]

[Verse]
You don't succeed cause you hesitate
You think we're fly, but we levitate
Just be yourself, don't ask us why
Cause if you don't, we'll make you cry

[Chorus]</pre>
