[Intro: repeat 2X]
Release the convicts and drop the bombs it's
Sound the alarm, it's the final conflict

[Virtuoso]
I used to think all conflicts had one victor
But as the world gets sicker I realize
that the Final Conflict has no victor
The Sword of the Lictor paints the picture
This pen could change the scripture, this gat could maim and split ya
If the drum track is the pulse, the orchestra is playin your heart strings
The needle touch the record, a sharp sting
The total blackness like my stainless steel lung from smokin cactus
This ain't "Inside the Actors Studio" with James Lipton
These are deranged visions, brain twist addiction
from a man on an insane mission trying to change the game, listen
Splittin skulls like cliffdivers jumping drunk head first
Pull gats from the ground to get around on this dead earth
versus insurmountable odds
with trillions of dollars annually gone on account of the fraud
And the counter departments of the Lord, houses of God
When thousands are hard, and meals are gettin thrown in the garbage
And we spoiled rotten little children shot in broad daylight
And the cradle of civilization is choppin off clitorises, it ain't right
And our natural green sources crumble, watch as they fall
We harness the Sun's energy like Sergeant Kamal
in Bangladesh, like monumental structures like Louis Khan
On a search for my architect like his bastard son
Pass the gun, the V to the I onto the T-U-O-S-O
See you, wouldn't wanna be you
Cause we move flows like rocks in Rio Piedras
Called anjels, got nailed to a cross but V is no savior
My voice dance not my feet cause V isn't Savion
Glover but motherfuckers run from the big bang
The gang shake your hand then shoot at you all
Preach peace with a sadistic streak, the Buddhist Saddam
Unusual calm, in the face of total devastation
society's facin wrestlin implosion like the Greco-Romans
Check the omen, we take back what they've stolen
Even strapped in Iraq, while back home big bangs explodin
It's the Final Conflict

[repeat 3X]
Sound the alarm, it's the final conflict
Release the convicts and drop the bombs it's

[Virtuoso] + Wu-Tang samples
It's big bang, now who wants war?
"Born ready, my machete" Blue Sky Black Death
"Born ready, get torn by my machete"
"Soldier of fortune, lost in the madness"
"Born ready, get torn by my machete"
"Brandish a weapon or get dropped to the canvas"
"Born ready, get torn by my machete"
"Double trouble, triple sickness plus genocide"
"I'm born ready, get torn by my machete"
"Double trouble, triple sickness plus genocide"</pre>
