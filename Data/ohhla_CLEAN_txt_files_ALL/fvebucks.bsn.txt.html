[Big Sean]
I do it
D townn
Boyyy, hey
Ok, I'm smoking loudly I walk them all, I pick up that tree when it's not fall
I'm going off that tree when it's not tall
I'm in love with tree I'm a avatar
I pick up an O from my nigga ralphy, my bro and me but he is not alphy
going of that goo punch it makes me drouzy, roll up the window it makes it cloudy
Damnn, if you ain't know, I made these girl nice smoke paper and bowls
my ladies like blunts hit em twice if not once
I blow em off and just pass em to my bros
Now catch you getting brains if a nigga not learning
I spending money if a nigga not earning
Catch me in the backseat if I'm not stirring
and catch me rolling up if a nigga not burning

[Chorus]
I got five on it
Grab your 40
Let's get keyed
I got five on it
Messin' with that Indo weed
I got five on it
It's got me stuck and not go back
I got five on it
Partner let's go half on a sac

[Chip Tha Ripper]
You know a nigga like to stay at that cruising altitude up in the sky
try and fuck with paper planes but it's not the same high
Cleveland niggas ain't no bitches we prefer the cigarello smoke
If you say you take away the taste and get some better smoke
Cause this shit I blow can get smelt on the next block
Ain't no middle mans every thing you need is in stock
This gloc is all the security I need
I be solo, dolo, when you see me blowing on some weed
Watch me, no be, I be just taking it slow, I be so clean diesel over powers my cologne
now all the bad bitches who blazed on shit this way
you all just some white girls with leaves I am the sensai
now I bow to the bag never save the best for last
cause when I come around niggas know to hurry up and pass
Fuck a dime son, let's cop a quarter pound, what the fuck is you gonna put down
Nigga I got five.

[Chorus]

[Curren$y]
How wired, 6-4 hydraulics
Now stolen lost my keys that was high platinum
Fuck you want, this the raw paper now the blunt you must got me mixed up with chip
cause this spitter zig zag a whole zippa shit strung shoulda came with a big pick up
Bitches calling me, wanna smoke big and for me to pick up
she blow me while I'm blowing rings of that killa, then we just smoking brown
Fake weed to much make a clown
Get real smoking green strawberry fields
High standing up feeling like I'm laying down
couple bugee cuties came round acting stuck up now they just stuck from smoking with us
Had that hallways smelling as my windows opening up
I inhale walk and talk as the security coming up

[Chorus]</pre>
