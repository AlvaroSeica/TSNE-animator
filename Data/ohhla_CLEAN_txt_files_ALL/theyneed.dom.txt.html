[Intro: Dom Pachino]
Do me a favor, tell me

[Chorus: Dom Pachino]
Why do they sound that way? Where the flow at?
Where the worldplay? Where the lyrics?
Where the topics, if this is what they call hip hop
Then this is garbage
Why do they sound that way? Where the flow at?
Where the worldplay? Where the lyrics?
Where the topics, if this is what they call hip hop
Then they need to stop it

[Dom Pachino]
Man, they bout, more money, more interest
Is it the money, ya dunny, it's all in this
I find it funny, but money is all business
Whose ice got more flash, whose wife got more ass
Whose safe got more cash, whose gat got more blast
Is it shit talk or rap
Hip hop, done flip flopped, it's wack
Whose buying they shit, get ya money back
I keep my eye in it, but it's dying quick
I keep my ear to it, it disappoint my drums
I keep hearing it, echo throughout my slums
On some, Chicken Noodle Soup, Lean Wit It, Walk Wit It
What they need to do is put a cork in it
But I don't wanna hate, get paper, kill the culture
Cuz nobody gives a fuck til it's dead and it's over
Don't ever say you never heard it from the soldier

[Chorus]

[Dom Pachino]
Yo, let's take it back when, the shit was hot
Where you didn't have to pay radio to get a spot
On the top ten, as long as your lyrics was tight
And your beats was popping...
Now it's all demographics, it's all SoundScan and these bastards
CDs, but they ain't really bastards, they a part of me
And we about to push through so pardon we
It's a Napalm World, it ain't hard to see
I treat the game like plastic, I'm charging, see
Any doors in my way, I'm barging, B.
I play to win, when I play, so, aye
You don't really really want it with P, I
Put it in your face so ya'll niggas can see
That the game in dying need of a real M.C.
Yeah, uh, and that happen to be me
Keep it stepping while still repping the N.Y.C.
To the, F-U-Double L-E-S-T

[Chorus]</pre>
