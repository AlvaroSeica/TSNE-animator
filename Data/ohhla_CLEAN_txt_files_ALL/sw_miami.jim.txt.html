[Talking]
You see rap music is subliminal
but the music for us is like our own diary
something like a confession
they tell me life is a bitch
she something like the seasons just like mother nature
she comes and go as she please
thats why they get their period once a month
I say that to say this
if you dig that bitch
the summer is yours
she could be cheating on you
ya heard

[Verse 1]
got me feeling like opium
I'm tryin dance with the low of them
open a bottle and it goes around
I'm leaving drunk by 4 A.M.
And watch me jump in a Dolce Benz
top down with the pokey rims
and now I'm swerving so you know I'm bent
I lost count so who knows what I spent
I recall nine {?}
Bitches stepping on my nice sneakers
with one hand in the sky and the other hand was on her thigh
I was grinding to the beat with one hand on my side
now the g's only as we speed to the Rolex
and three or four g's is what we sneeze on the Rolex
playing some {?} {?} it's about 6 A.M.
You think the night is over but it just begin
they say clubs pacing like Bad Boys 2
you can see the snow bunnies doing what bad girls do
thats ecstasy weed that had girl to
scoop the bitch that had ki's selling fast off blue
now I'm speeding to the telly got the Porsche behind
trying to get in her belly the only thought on my mind
like damn; not trying to be pushy or nothing
but since the strip joint girl I should have been fucking

[Verse 2]
I can't keep it long anymore
I be with my girl when it starts to {?}{?}
And when you love three women it's hard to keep up with the lies
you see spring my first love I started creeping with July
use to say I had some shows
catch a plane to M-I
then I started tricking dough and bought a Range for July
but I said I'm love sick over this hot ass hoochie
and I seen her when I saw Nas I slapped her with scoofy(?)
We don't play disrespect but that was the day that me met
summer jam o-2 I hit the stage with my set
but the {?} was from Brooklyn she stil slipped me the number
she said he's on vacation she get with me this summer
then I been flirting with her over the past two years
now she hates seeing me in the winter ain't gonna last through the years
now I'm looking at winter like life's in the picture
and then when June comes I'll be gone til September
now would you hate me for that
I know your heart's cold could you wait til I'm back
I'm just a sucker for love
but a nigga hold me down if you wanna fuck with a thug</pre>
