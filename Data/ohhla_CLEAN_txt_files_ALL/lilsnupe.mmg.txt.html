[Intro: Lil Snupe]
HAH~! It's Lil Snupe nigga
Lil Snupe in this bitch
Got my mind in this bitch, hah!

[Chorus 2X: Lil Snupe]
I'm just a nigga happy that I made it out
I pray to God every night I see the safer route
Chasing this money, I promise I'll never stop
Started from the bottom but still made it to the top

[Lil Snupe]
I finally made it out the gutter
Made a way where my momma and granny don't gotta struggle
Just to know that I did it the feeling is like no other
I'm shittin' on all you suckas, nigga ketchup like mustard
Free my nigga C4 I'm tired of seeing him suffer
Free my nigga C-Roy, somebody a undercover
I hold it down for my niggas; even though they ain't with us 
they got me looking at pictures, breaking down all these swishers
my life is getting amazing, I be trippin' out daily
Where I come from it's crazy, I cry to know that I made it
Promise that I'm the hottest, I put that on my T lady
Finna kill the game, hope I hope these niggas can face it
Fuck anybody who hatin', swear that I'ma be the greatest 
and I put that shit on Coop; niggas better watch for Snupe
Refuse to rap the lies, I only can speak the truth
I'm the product of the boot, free that nigga Boosie-Bo
Real shit nigga...

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Snupe, I wish I was with you, I miss you, holdin' your pictures
Rollin' these swishas wishin' I was blowin' them with you my nigga
Your brother, your sister, your granpy, your granny, your uncle
Your aunties and all of my cousins...
