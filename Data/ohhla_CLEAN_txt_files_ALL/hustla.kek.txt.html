(*talking*) 
Gangstas and grinders, hoodlums and hustlers 
By any means necessary, to come from the bottom 
To turn nothing into something, to travel the storm 
And perservere through anything, I am a hustler 
My brother's keeper, Young Don nigga ok 
I am a hustler, yes, Don Ke 7-13 hey yeah 

[Lil' Keke] 
Heart of a hustler bout his paper, yeah he bread winning 
I am a fighter not a lover, keep they head spinning 
Yeah pretty cars, big stallion 
I got my shooter in the corner, call him Ray Allen 
They smoking Reggie Miller, you know that shit I serve 
We high as Blake Griffin, cooking up Larry Bird's 
They say the city mine, I see the lights flashing 
Wrecking niggaz checking niggaz, while the checks cashing 
I'm so tired of roaches, I can't stand leeches 
Catch me sipping pomegranates, I'm on Hawaiian beaches 
7-13, we rolling like the mob 
Get you some bidness go to work, and do your own job 
Them suckers still hating, I'm still doing me 
Houston Texas legendary, Mr. Don Ke 
Monster up and make it rough, I got a tougher grind 
Unlock the cage for the beast, they know it's suppertime 
All that capping and that talking, nigga pay your tab 
I spent fifty on the Lac, before I drove the slab 
The ice prices like the cocaine, and cream gravy 
Welcome to Texas, where them thangs over thirty lately 
Heart of a hustler bout his paper, yeah he bread winning 
I am a fighter not a lover, keep they head spinning 
Uh pretty cars, big stallion 
I got my shooter in the corner, call him Ray Allen 
Uh bob your head, say your prayers 
Come up missing, nobody cares 
Fuck a broke nigga, why even bother 
Hustle hard, like the Lord coming back tomorrow 
This for Boo-Boo, this for T-Man this for Cory Blount 
This for 13, the one with 7 in the front 
Niggaz talking niggaz bumping, but I still get it 
Don Ke about his paper, nigga deal with it 

(*talking*) 
That's what's up, if you a hustling nigga stand up 
If you a gangsta nigga stand up 
If you gon' get it by any means stand up 
Do it from your heart nigga, the introduction of my life 
Don Ke 7-13, heart of a hustler</pre>
