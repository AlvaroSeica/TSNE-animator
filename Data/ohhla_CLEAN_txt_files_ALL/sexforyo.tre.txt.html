[Trey Songz]
When you see me in the videos babe
Do I make your body go crazy?
Or when you catch me in a magazine baby
Do you rip me out and save my page?
If my voice comes through your speaker
and you legs suddenly get weaker
This is for you, yeah
I'm hopin it's gon get you thru
So I can get to you
Tell me what you see
when you think of me
I want this to be
just like your fantasy
Oh, girl
Girl I'm comin over
Got some things to show ya
Turn yo stereo up

[Chorus]
Got some sex for your stereo
Girl you wanna bump it
Turn it up don't turn me down
promise that you'll love it
Now put your hands on the radio
don't be scared to touch it
Imagine I was there
baby pulin on your hair
Got some sex for your stereo
Show me how you take it
My words move like hands
and I'm singin to you naked
Got some sex for your stereo
Girl you wanna bump it
Turn it up don't turn me down
promise that you'll love it

[Trey Songz]
Now can my ladies in the back make some noise?
I see you
It don't matter where you are
In ya crib, at ya job, or in the car
It's for you
This is for you
Wherever you can stick me in (stick me in)
just let the record spin
Baby it's on you
What you gonna do?
Choice is all yours:
you can put me in fast-forward, or
we can start the record over (over)
Can you feel my words creepin up your legs
takin off your clothes?

[Chorus]

[Trey Songz]
Now you need a little bass, so let me give you a taste
I want you to feel my subwolfer, baby when I give it to ya
Now you need some highs, so I'ma make you touch the sky
Ooh, girl now slide your body near
Girl take them headphones, come a little closer
So I can hear you when you moan
Now let me just adjust your knob, turn it 'til I get you hot
Get you hot, get you hot, I won't stop - oh!

[Chorus]</pre>
