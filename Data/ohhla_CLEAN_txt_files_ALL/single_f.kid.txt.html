Lately I've been spending lots of time with my kid
Telling him stories bout the things that we did
When we were a family, long time ago
I've answered his questions till I'm blue in the face
Wish all that hurt in him, I could erase
But I tell him the truth, cause he ain't too young to know

Single father, part-time mother
When I'm not one, then I'm the other
You used to be my full-time lover
Now I'm a single father, and a part-time mother

I spend every minute I can with my boy
There's no doubt about it, he's my pride and joy
Someday he'll grow up and I won't have him no more
Some things I just find too hard to explain
So we go to McDonald's or I buy him a train
And we put it together on the living room floor

Such is the life of a single father
He says 'daddy explain, if it's not too much bother'
Why it's just you and me, living here in this home
I don't understand it, and neither does he
Why there's just two, when there should be three
Of us sharing this moment, Lord I feel so lone

Single father, part-time mother
When I'm not one, then I'm the other
You used to be my full-time lover
Now I'm a single father, and a part-time mother

You used to be, my full-time lover
Now I'm a single father, and a part-time mother
Now I'm a single father, and a part-time mother</pre>
