[Denzel Washington from "Training Day"]
King Kong, ain't got shit, on me!

[Apathy]
Bring out the apes, the gorillas, the monkies and junkies
Half money, half bummy, half genius, half dummy
Dirty, slutty, bloody, muddy, filthy fuck buddy
If you stup-y you should study how I'm steady makin money
Like I'm Steady B, Freddy Kruger, bald as Lex Luthor
Spark buddha, pick a public park, become a sharpshooter
Chop an off duty cop up in the chop suey
channelin Tupac through me {*hach ptooey*} damn I'm such a Glock groupie
Vagrant, a bad man, as mad here, as Batman
My jammer hammer probably got your grandma yellin like she Janis Joplin
I'm joshin, please get off my Johnson
I see you bitches jockin this jargon that I'm jottin
I'm Jesus, a genius, a G I'm a genie
Grantin bitches wishes if they wish is for my pee-pee
I'm greasy and greedy and creepy and freaky and skeevy
Your breezy will fuck me for a CD

[samples]
They're very very dangerous, they're wild animals
Something's got to be done

[Chorus: Vinnie Paz]
Yo, look at all this wild shit y'all caught me on
with firearms, now it's on like Honkey Kong
Where my gorillas at? Where my apes at? {*2X*}
Look at all this wild shit y'all got me on
They play this song and it's on like Honkey Kong
Where my gorillas at? Where my apes at? {*2X*}

[Apathy]
Bring out the red ones, the devils, bring out the vandals
Bring the vicious ditch diggers and bitches with love handles
Bring the bummy scummy stretch mark tummy with no money
Strobelight honey who swear she like a Playboy bunny
Half this fatty, Daffy atittude, crabby to scrab me verbally
Abusive baby daddy callin liquor stores to packy
I'm picky in particular, consider sex an extra-curricular test
and you can call me Professor Testicular
Stick it in ya, dick dangle down to my fibula
Nah I'm fibbin, it just barely touch the top of my tibia
The city touchin, city crushin, pretty fuckin disgustin
kiddy abductin giddy off the gal' of luther dust
A chauvinist, a show-off, a slash in your show pants
Or Eric B. with dooky ropes so call me the dope man
You fucks don't even know if you don't come up with my dough
you'll hear more 9's than German people screamin no
I'm that Honkey Kong, orangutang, killer ape... {*slows down*}

[Chorus]

[Outro: Vinnie Paz]
Where my gorillas at? Where my apes at? {*4X*}</pre>
