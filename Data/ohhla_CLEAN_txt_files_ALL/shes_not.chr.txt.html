[Chorus 4X: Christbearer]
She's not, just another woman
She's not, whoa-whoa-whoa

[Christbearer]
And she's not just, anotherrrrrrrr
Cuz little, in the bed, can discover
Yeah... when she start on brother...
I don't believe, I had to run up on another...
So... so much pain... oh oh
I feel you... don't you, feel me singing
Never ever gonna make you (never) work overtime...
This thing, cuz when you with me, feel...
You there... ohhh... never say this thing, oh this thing...

[Chorus 4X]

[Christbearer]
Some people kill... some people steal...
Some make, some owe, somewhere...
Not here... get a piece of the pie...
Muhfuck', give me what you got, what you got
What you got, give me what you got
We know, what to do, for sure
When God know... who, it be, dirty
Everlast dance with you, and I
Forever do I die, that's the last thing, cuz

[Chorus 4X]

I love you... I love you...

Freak out... freak out... out....</pre>
