Mic check, never ever lose the respect
Of hip-hop, roaming the streets in the Mecca
I don't shuck and jive and I don't dilly dally
I keep the crowd hyped and packed like Don Valley
I rally, with the emcee on the corner
But I'm a warn you, I've got rhymes till the morning
Sun, I used to push a Land Rover
Now I push a pen to the pad, the dream is over
Stop biting cause it's inciting
Me to send blows of flows and beat riding
The most spectacular vernacular actor
That ya'll, bringing stature, combat your, ego
But even that is a battle
So hard to keep my motives pure and not metal
Rebels, without a cause, break laws
But I'd rather break food over the beat for the applause
Tours, I did them
Holes in the game, I knit them
I wonder whatever happened to Sally in the valley 
Hmm, it seems she's all grown up,
Time to head to Miskoky cause the game's sewn up.

[Chorus]
I've been trying to learn this new song
But I hear the same old music every day
Hey, hey, hey,
To the, to the, to the, to the,
Going to fly with her to the Yukon
Going to melt my soul on ice then get away
Hey, hey, hey,
Hey, hey, hey.

Yo, people here I am, here I am, what
Laid back in the cut, trying to construct
A stone house, with an invisible mirror
So I could take a look at myself a bit clearer
Seen, if you don't get it then don't cram
Observe that you do, then you can understand
I was walking down the street when I met this girl
Who said she was in love, with diamonds and pearls
Shiny new rides, plush leather seats
Baby don't you know you're just reacting to the streets
You acting like a freak cause your daddy left home
Now you want a rock and a man with his own
Things, girl, get off the bling-bling
Train, it's turning our people into insane
Fiends, for cellular phones and blue jeans
Why? Because they want a piece of the pie
My abilita (ability) familifa (familiarize), a quicker mind
But I need to proceed deep with a god speed
Indeed, whack emcees get the gong
K-dub looking above with new songs

[Chorus]

I don't want to know, how we came to be
All that I've been shown, is there's only you and me
Help me figure out, where this all went wrong
I think we need a new song, a new song</pre>
