[Trey Songz]
Reminiscin I remember me and you we used to play with the dogs
While you were sleep I'd stare, stare while you lay in my arms
And now I'm stuck on stupid rain forrest couldnt get wetter than you get
I used to beat it up you gave me your love I abused it now I'm facing the music

Oh how I yearn for your touch I'm so lonely now that you left me
If I could run away you know I would
And I'm hurtin cause girl I never loved you like I should
When your love is lost
Your whole worlds thrown off
When the one you need dont need you
What do you do when love is lost

I was trippin wouldnt listen now I'm sitting sipping shots at the bar
Now I'm riding to the 90's hits listening to aerosmith
I dont wanna close my eyes dont wanna fall asleep
Tell me how I can I be fly without the wind beneath my wings

Oh how I yearn for your touch I'm so lonely now that you left me
If I could run away you know I would
And I'm hurtin cause girl I never loved you like I should
When your love is lost
Your whole worlds thrown off
When the one you need dont need you
What do you do when love is lost

And now I see
The man you need
When I look into the mirror I see change
And I close my eyes and wish you could see the same
But its too late

When your love is lost
Your whole worlds thrown off
When the one you need dont need you
What do you do

When your love is lost
Your whole worlds thrown off
When the one you need dont need you
What do you do when love is lost

Lost gone out the window
When love is lost
Lost cant see your love no more
When the one you need dont need you
What do you do when love is lost</pre>
