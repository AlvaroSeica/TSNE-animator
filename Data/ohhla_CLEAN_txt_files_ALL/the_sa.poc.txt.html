[Bad Boy]
(Verse 1)
I'm uncommonly
The bass hits kind of wobbly
The scene hit like a robbery
The air pace like a muh'fucker
I bounced out
The only thing underground now's my mom's house (Ha ha)
The first heard
Last
I took niggas in class
Then pull a pistol on your ass
You know
I shouldn't have to say it
I don't need to
Eses way deep, shake two in the neck
Question, question, lowrider
Loco, that's owned by us
Walkin' in my own white chucks
And you can have all nine bucks
Back, if you stock my stuff
I'm too nice
I don't shine, but I'm too bright
I don't rest, but I do ride (Eastside)
I'll refrain, scrapin', hoppin' Daytons
My nigga head straight for the stations and tell 'em

Repeat Chorus Twice

(Verse 2)
Now listen, man, this Bad Boy gon' get it
With no rest, my flow's exhibit/Xzibit
You got it?
I got some jewels in my pocket
I got CDs in the market
I'm like some mix
When you drop it
I'm like some coke when you rock it
I'm like a gun when you cock it
I wanna roam where 2Pac did
All the way to where Big Pop' live
Then do it like the homie Frost did
I'm unstoppable
I'm as serious as hospitals
Cause I don't speak unless it's logical
And they said it was impossible (Bitch)
Now they callin' me the Rock Gamble (Gamble...)
So what's next?
I wanna write lots of checks (That's right)
I wanna have lots of sex
I'm on a straight rock my Lex
Cause my time is like a box of threats
So go ahead and call me, Mex-ican

Repeat Chorus Twice

(Verse 3)
It's on now
Have you checked the skills
I came to prove a point, I ain't expectin' deals
So put your hands up, nigga, I'm a grab my handcuffs
And tie you up to your man, brah
Ya ain't leavin'
This polo goin' cholo theivin'
So follow cause it's low-low season
I wanna have a low-low meetin'
And show 'em what the cholos bringin'
I wanna have the whole world singin' (Come on)

Repeat Chorus Twice

[Bad Boy]
Eses...
That's right...
Eses
Underdogs...
Comin' at ya...
For the year 2 Double-O 2...</pre>
