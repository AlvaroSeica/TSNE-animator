I Heard you say that no one seems to care 'bout you
It's in your eyes, you think that live's unfair to you
Just give it all you got, my friend
Just give it all you got, it's not the end

Cause you outta know
There's a reason for these changin' seasons
God only knows how much your heart can bear
So don't you let go
Everybody has their up and down times
Everybody needs to know how much they're loved
My friend
So hold on, it's not the end

As I remember everything you touch
Would turn to gold
You held a secrets
To make your grandest dreams unfold
You were the very best of us all
It's just a love song
Cause everybody needs a friend
I'll be right here for you
just a simple prayer
It's from the bottom of my heart
That He'll never let you go

Cause you outta know
There's a reason for these changing seasons
God only knows how much your heart can bear
So don't you let go
Everybody has their up and down times
Everybody needs to know how much their loved
My friend, so hold on, it's not the end</pre>
