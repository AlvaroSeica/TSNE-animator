[Intro: Shawn Wigs (Yosemite Sam sample)]
Aiyo, Sammy, you know, you'se a clown, man
Why don't you just, why don't you just shut your mouth?
(Ok, I'll shut up, I'm not one that has to keep talking
Some fellas just have to keep their mouths flapping, but no me
I was brought up right) Brought up right, what are you talking about?
You'se a character, man, you can't even add up, right, man
You'se a nothing (Two nothings is nothing, that's mathematics son
You can argue with me, but you can't argue with figures) Why not?
(Two half nothings is a whole nothing) That's right and ain't nothing goin
on right here

[Shawn Wigs]
Yo, son it's simple mathematics, how things come together
The moon changes the night, the sun changes the weather
Stars is on TV, the thugs, the talk greasy
Don't ever gamble your money, it's that easy
It's common sense, repent your sins, count your wins
Forget your losses, sometimes you pay dues to the bosses
Big fish eat little fish, and your wish don't come true from blowing on no
cake
You want it, you gotta take it, who out get it, to make it
The only thing you liable to get, is a little hatred
But God bless, people hate to see success
Hate to see you progress, while they life's all stressed
So proceed on your to the riches, don't let the ugly
Virus of life, give you program glitches
You made it, this far, believe in God or Allah
Whoever blesses your life and helps to heal scars

[Outro: Shawn Wigs]
In life, you got negativy and positive energy
It's simple mathematics, don't let nobody bring you down
On your way up, keep it positive...</pre>
