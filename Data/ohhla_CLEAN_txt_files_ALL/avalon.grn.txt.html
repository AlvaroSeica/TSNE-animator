Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Yeah.. yeah..
Yeah... yeah..

It's time to even it up
I guess a round table weren't equal enough
You can't contain me
With chains I'm free
and I run free
Any enemy is coming with me when I'm done

Whatever's asked to me I perform
I rip through the rain into the eye of the storm
Still carrying the flame, eye of the torch
Failure comes at a price I can't afford
Never been half hearted I put my all in
Forfited all just to answer my calling
Wearing the scars of the wars that I fought in
Should'a been heading for the stars but I'm falling

I have your sword and cape
If you need them I'll be swimming in the lake
Oh baby don't look down, just take the crown

[CHORUS]
We'll be kings forever, oh oh oh
Holding on together, oh oh oh
Feeling so much better oh oh oh
When everything was wrong and everything was gone
We ran to Avalon

I fought till I had no fight left
Risked my death
Walked with conviction in everyone of my steps
My strengths water enough
To wash away any of the stains on my rep
Yeah, I fought off vultures
Went against odds when I was short on soldiers
I asked not for my burden to be lightened
but if I may have broader shoulders
so as I may carry the weight all the doubt I had in me has been allayed
so from now til the day that I'm carried away I will never walk around what stands in my way
fuck if they ain't letting off cos neither will I
When I die from the ashes an eagle will rise
long as my blade and my faith keep me alive
Fear is something that you wont see in my eyes

[CHORUS]

I left competion out for the count no abacus
Fought for the crowd, fought down challengers
When my massacre was ordained I remained through pain forged my sword
I left competion out for the count no abacus
Fought for the crowd, fought down challengers
When my massacre was ordained I remained through pain forged my sword, my Excalibur

[CHORUS]</pre>
