Fuck Off
Unlike me you're gonna run away 
Unlike me you'll see another day
Run like me out on the highway
I will ride so far
I'll probably never make it there

I never went to college
I ain't got no skills
I got hair to my shoulders
And a bottle of pills
I got bills stacked up
Like a turkey club
I blew my last dime drinkin
At the local pub

I am not sunshine
I am dark and grey
For this life of sins 
I live, each day I pay
I am not jesus
But I died in vein
Only to relive each day I'll pay

Unlike me you're gonna run away
Unlike me you'll see another day
Run like me, out on the highway
I will ride so far
I'll probably never make it there

Rock rock y'all
To the beat y'all
Check it out y'all
You cant stop y'all
Rock rock y'all
To the beat y'all
Check it out y'all
You come alive y'all
Come on

I never felt at home
Although I grew up loved
I got a junkies mind
In a ramblin man's blood
Got a flood full of thoughts
That's caught in a dam
Somedays I'm gone
But that's where I am
I'm fit to slip
Another rippin rhyme
Im so ahead of the game
I feel left behind
Another dime to boost
I got boots of lead
Hope I live to see
This pirate's bread

I am not sunshine
I am dark and grey
For this life of sins I live
Each day I pay
I am not jesus
But I died in vein
Only to relive each day I pay

Unlike me you're gonna run away
Unlike me you'll see another day
Run like me out on the highway
I will ride so far
I'll probably never make it there</pre>
