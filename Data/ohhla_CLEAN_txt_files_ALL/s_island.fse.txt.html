[Leathafase]
Staten Island get the money
Niggas still scream'n, Paper take'n
A razor scraping your facial inside a vacant basement
There's no replacement, I'll give you The Joker's face lift
Or spray the fifth and make you an instant heart surgeon patient
I was once abducted by a spaceship
Then recreated by the exact same chick that fabricated The Matrix
A hustler on the grave shift that just turned atheist
Witness eighty-six Christians murder Jesus for his greatness
His rise was celebrated with new cloths and the latest kicks
They call it Easter, Bullet holes are engraved into the bricks
The greatest war summit, This isn't a war I wanted
God why did my son have to be incubated in a whore's stomach
Fucking every dud she grinds on in the club
She's blind, Using savage acts of sex to find love
Rise above the madness, Confront this, Face punishment
Or get raided worse then Georgia by a Russian gun ship
Shit I'm half man half amazing, Got women salivating
Saying that I'm they babies daddy and they gladly waiting
For me to break up with the women I'm recently dating
Peace for the Haitian and Puerto Rican penetration
And tenants placed in secret locations
Under investigation for using crack to pay for my child's education
From the corner to the radio station, Broadcasted
Rapid automatics raining lead when I forecast it
This alpha male savage weapon is die casted
Raw gun metal crafted manufactured by a blacksmith

Possibly I squash the at a high velocity
Animosity, Kill the cat son for curiosity
My city of Atlantis, Giant gigantic
Small Earth people panic, Kill an innocent bystanders
Threaten to bomb your planet like Marvin the Martian
Charging my squadron, The drill is off
Killing off your Sergeant, I beg your pardon
In a mist of Agent Orange soldiers swarm and die
Elect Vietnam, Bombing a foreign
More corrupt then Gates, More psycho then Bates
From the hotel I masturbate and jerk shots from a tre eight
So vacate the premises, Your helicopter is shot
Your propeller's popped, You dropped in a hot pot of cosmic slop
Why is it not, The best lyrical style you heard of
Cause crabs get murdered, And every two bars clips inserted
Insert it between the blue lines, Parallel, Burn in Hell
Rap style dirty where the germs dwell, Spray your disinfectants
Try and get rid of me, Consider me the epitome
You puny humans get broke like virginity
Electricity flows within me like Raiden, Then I slayed him
You crabs can all suck my dick with an invitation</pre>
