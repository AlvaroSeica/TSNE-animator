Typed by: AZ Lyrics

American man
American man
American man
So don't try and tell me that
I am a part of a
Government of conspiracy!
Pretty lies mean more papers
To terrorize escapers
For what
It's only to please
Asking all of those questions
And giving no section
And pleading fucked up insane
Grab your remote control
Or your biscuit and coat
Or kick back and watch your tv
Yeah yeah
Cause I am an american man
Livin' life how it ought to be
And I ain't got time for political aspects
Shut up I was born free!
American man
American man
American man
And it's so right to fight for your rights
Lets unite!
To save our own contry
Through our tragic relations
Disturbing frustrations
For what
It's only to please
Getting what is not coming
Disturbing
You're running
From what
I havent a clue
Grab your remote control
Or your biscuit or coat
Or kick back and watch your tv
Yeah yeah
Cause I am an american man
Livin' life how it ought to be
But I ain't got time for political aspects
Shut up I was born free!
And I am an american man
Livin' life how it ought to be
And I ain't got time for political aspects
Shut up! I was born free!
Shut up! I was born free!</pre>
