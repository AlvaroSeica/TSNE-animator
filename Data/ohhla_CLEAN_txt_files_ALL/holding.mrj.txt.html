Song:   Holding On

(Chorus)
I'm on your side
Dark days, cold nights
This is what we're going through
Keep holding on
I can hear your cry
I'm on your side
Dark days, cold nights
This is what we're going through
Keep holding on
It'll be alright

It's just for now you could focus on the roses at your feet
And all the poses that we keep
Hold on frozen in a mental feature
So when you sleep, the only messages that creep 
From the part of you that speaks 
Are the words that I am a gentle creature
And maybe then, with our fingers like pens
We could draw upon our skin holy images of matrimony
But how and when, seem to come now and again
From your brow to your chin, your confession is that we are lonely
If we could only escape to the memories
That take precious moments like these from a youthful heart
I would hold you, and thank you for everything that makes you a blessing
And see you for who you truly are

(Chorus)
I'm on your side
Dark days, cold nights
This is what we're going through
Keep holding on
I can hear your cry
I'm on your side
Dark days, cold nights
This is what we're going through
Keep holding on
It'll be alright

When what was, rings louder than what is
I doubt there ever will be space for a new star
And all of the cosmos, we focus on what costs most:
Memories of pain and a new scar
Well it's to those stars and underneath you
The distance these loving arms would reach
When you think I'm hard to find
In a world without options
You suddenly stopped by a stranger
And find later that those arms are mine
In a better time and place
A feather of divine grace fades 
Into white parades of free birds
Defined within their chase 
I find that I've been waiting my whole life
Just to say these words

(Chorus)
I'm on your side
Dark days, cold nights
This is what we're going through
Keep holding on
I can hear your cry
I'm on your side
Dark days, cold nights
This is what we're going through
Keep holding on
It'll be alright</pre>
