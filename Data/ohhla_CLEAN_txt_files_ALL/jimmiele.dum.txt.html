[Dungeon Masta]
If I had a son I might, name the nigga Darryl
If it's a daughter, name the black bitch Carol
Fuck it, Dungeon Masta be the pharaoh
Open your eyes, it's no, the suprise
Fuck that, coming soon one in the sky
The caper, gone be gone vapor
Smoke ya ass quick, don't I give a fuck about your lame

[kung fu sample]
Why did you kill your master Lord Jhing?
Elder, I swear I'm innocent
It is a regulation, no matter who you are
If you break the rules you must take punishment

*beat changes*

[Chorus: Dungeon Masta]
When things just don't go such as planned, let it go
You gots to be yourself, take the punishment like a man

[Dungeon Masta]
The baby, the child, the teen, the young
The dust, the crack, the smart, the dumb
The raw, the four, the rich, the broke
The Nestle trees that I love to smoke
The game, the name, the cash, the fame
Mean shit to me, ya'll niggas is lame
The real, the fake, the kill, the wake
The snitches, the snake, the bitches, the jake
The digits, the break, to steal, to take
The friends that I know that I love to hate
The pills, the great, the sex, the rape
The rip, the straight, the chalk, the tape
The lions, the tigers, the bears, oh my
The joy, the lame, the tears, oh why
The heat, the cold, the meek, the bold
I got to tell you what my grandmother told me

[Chorus]

[Dungeon Masta]
The truth, the lies, the legs, the thighs
The pussy, the tits, the ass, the eyes
The glock, the tech, the coke, the cheese
Got friends that becoming my enemies
The worker, the boss, the win, the loss
The vicks, the hoes, the price, the cost
The calm, the strong, the shape, the form
The weak, the warm, the blunts, the bong
You want to follow me, then come along
I will get you higher than Cheech &amp; Chong
The court, the case, the jail, the wait
The gem star, the face, the buck fifty ---
The fight, the brawl, the tale, the small
The niggas who came with no alcohol
The wife, the mistress, the girlfriend, too soon
The Goose, the Belvy, the Henny, the 40's

[Chorus]

[Dungeon Masta]
The living, the dead, the NARc, the Feds
The gyms, the shorts, the hat, the dreads
The rave, the spot, the story, the plot
The hole underground up in Salem's Lot
The lab, the dark, the pound, the spark
The hustle, the bark, the sleep, the mark
The bra, the skirts, the nails, the flirt
The dirt, to the grave, the pain, don't hurt
The face, the vest, the followers, the nest
To the hands that's been in the air, now hit the floor
The hawk, the style, the friends, the grab
The help, the him, the foul, the flow

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
