Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Yea, Lil B
I'm with that thug shit man
You from the hood, so spit that shit

Have drugs in yo mouth, we live that kind of shit
Have ten stolen cars, I beat that kind of shit
Almost lost my life, I feel that kind of pain
Went down to court and I ain't sayin no names

Have drugs in yo mouth, we live that kind of shit
Have ten stolen cars, I beat that kind of shit
Almost lost my life, I feel that kind of pain
Went down to court and I ain't sayin no names

Man, niggas don't know I've been out here living
One thing they do know â they got beds in prison
And they waitin for the niggas that's out there livin
Better slow down man, and find yo mission
Cause niggas get fucked in the worst position
They be happy with 30, do 10, they quittin
Do 5 hour house drug program living
Lindsay Lohan don't know about my program
Transfer you by a bus, shocker, you know you get me washed
Why you lookin through the window? Barely seeing through
Tryina wave at the car that's driving past you
Lookin at the city man, this shit ain't pretty
I'm just tryina dance like my nigga Diddy
10 years ago niggas wasn't programmed with me
Now every program got a program with me
You in the game and you doin rap social 1-50

Wearin suckas man, you gotta watch your shit
Sez niggas gon fake when the darkness hit
A lot of people die just to talk and shit
Spark the shit, you better spark the clip, you feel me?
Niggas act weird with that awful shit
Off this shit, takin off this shit
All this shit, I'll ride on any sucka
Tell them cocksuckers they can't touch us

Lil Boss!

Have drugs in yo mouth, we live that kind of shit
Have ten stolen cars, I beat that kind of shit
Almost lost my life, I feel that kind of pain
Went down to court and I ain't sayin no names

Have drugs in yo mouth, we live that kind of shit
Have ten stolen cars, I beat that kind of shit
Almost lost my life, I feel that kind of pain
Went down to court and I ain't sayin no names</pre>
