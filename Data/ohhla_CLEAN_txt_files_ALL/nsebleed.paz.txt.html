[R.A. the Rugged Man]
Yo, what should I say?
I don't really know what to say, heh

Ruin your idol, I'm glued to the Bible and my rifle
Losin your title, instead of shootin you're suin for libel
Everybody hate me cause I stay true to the facts
The Ku Klux Klan hate me more than Jews and Blacks
Yeah you over for certain, you could pray to whoever
Jehovah, Buddha, Allah, Jesus, Mother Mary the Virgin
Is it the violence that the TV taught us?
I grew up worshippin Charles Bronson, John Rambo and Chuck Norris
Pazienza the Pazmanian Damien rappin the pain he in
Crackin your cranium, I'm mackin mahogany at the Palladium
I'm Bruce Leroy, you Eddie Arkadian
I got the gat and the black and the Arabian
I'm waterboardin like Dick Cheney and aiyyo
Back at the first day of my birth
The moment I was born I was condemned by the Catholic church
Warsaw battlin the streets we inhabited
I'm +Sugar+ like Ray Robinson, you ain't even saccharine, leavin you staggerin
Makin an impact, New York we created this rap
This a blatant attack, East coast we takin it back
C'mon~!

[Chorus 2X: Amalie Bruun]
Life, is love, death, pain, hate
Nothing ain't left, ain't nothing to gain

[Vinnie Paz]
I'm lettin these motherfuckers live, it was truly compassion
I brutally bash 'em cause I'm steadily losin my passion
Tell Louie to stab 'em or to shoot 'em with two different Magnums
I'm usually packin, carry +Hawks+ like I'm Julian Jackson
I'll rob 'em for Gucci, I'm a thief, these are Lucifer's actions
I'm a provider, I'm a messiah, Jes√∫s's assassin
I don't think it's anybody livin that truly could match him
I slaughter Buddha through the computer, Medusa's companion
A lot of rappers wanna beef with the lion
Ain't too many people that's as fuckin lethal as I am
I'll feast 'em and fry 'em, Vinnie's so at peace with the violence
I exercise absolute power, peace to the tyrants
I'm old school like quarter waters and eatin in silence
You new school like faggot rappers competin for prizes
I'ma send you to the afterlife, speak to Osiris
And when he ask you why you there tell him the lethalest virus
Yeah, brrap~!

[Chorus]

[Outro: Vinnie Paz]
Yeah! Hahahahaha
Pazienza, the legendary R.A. the Rugged Man
What up cuzo? Raw rap, lyrical shit
Philly to New York, East coast bringin it back baby
All day, Official Pistol Gang
BRRAP! Hahahaha
