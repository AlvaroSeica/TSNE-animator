[Chorus]
So many times
I tried to feel this way
Every time I feel I have it;
It always seems to go away
And it all just really brought me down
Not really just knowing of how to react and the past
Is just haunting me wherever it's found

[Verse 1]
I'm feeling all alone until this day
So many nerves are running right thru my veins
And I can not even see straight can't consistrat
At first glance everything thing around you was a blur
Everything just stopped in my mind it was all on her
Fiending for love had me desperate in a sadful way
But today was the day I felt that way we start to date
Every single day I begin to pick her up
I didn't even know of the word enough
Try to do as much as I can to be a man
Everywhere we went were holding hands
So happy hoping it won't ever stop until I am gone
Didn't think anything on this earth can go wrong
Take her out to eat just about everyday
Just to make her happy she never had to pay
Whatever she wanted I tried my best to get
I was her Romeo but was she my Juliet?

[Chorus]
So many times
I tried to feel this way
Every time I feel I have it;
It always seems to go away
And it all just really brought me down
Not really just knowing of how to react and the past
Is just haunting me wherever it's found

[Verse 2]
She was my angel on this whole entire earth
She was my queen my light on this earth
Something that I always wanted was to feel this way
Obsessed with love soon drove my mind always
Slowly and slowly the phone began to never rang
I knew right then and there something wasn't same
But blinded by love
I couldn't think
My eyes started to burn every time I did blink
I was worried and I was stuck in one spot
Waiting outside with the phone in hand I was surely gonna pop
Am I gonna lose this girl who I really truly love?
It felt like I took a hit of a really bad drug
It was gone
Our aniversy came up and still received no word
1999 July the 9th was the day of final words
Feeling sick and thinking bout that day as hours fly bye
And I realized to myself, that's the day that I died

[Chorus]
So many times
I tried to feel this way
Every time I feel I have it;
It always seems to go away
And it all just really brought me down
Not really just knowing of how to react and the past
Is just haunting me wherever it's found</pre>
