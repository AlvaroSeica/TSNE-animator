[Intro: Big K.R.I.T.]
Back one mo' 'gin
Multi 'til the sun die, UGK 4 Life
Good Lord, Good Lord, it feels good to shine
(SHINE) Let's go

[Big K.R.I.T.]
By the time you prob'ly heard this
I was on another verse bitch 
Diamonds in the back with curtains 
Breakin hoes off, I never dose off at my post
Never disrespect your host, or bite the hand that feed ya
Cufflinks cold as Ebenezer, my momma prob'ly shoulda named me Caesar
Cleaner than a Baptist preacher, that used to pimp
Gator shoes don't make the man so, primp primp
So keep on with that, like I won't whip back
Around in that 'Lac 'Lac, that you done seen
Don't wurry about this, I'm surrious about this
If you know what I mean, shine on

[Chorus]
{"Shine on me..."}
(Don't get me wrong) Yeah, yeah, we shinin on
{"Shine on me..."}
(It's way too strong) Yeah, yeah, yeah, we shinin on
{"Shine on me..."}
(Don't get me wrong) Good Lord they know it, we shinin on
{"Shine on me..."}
(Ain't nobody trippin cause the money already made)

[Big K.R.I.T.]
So lately I've been observin (dat right)
A lot of these niggaz look nervous (dat right)
Come on in, don't be ashamed
Go an' steal some game from my sermon (Well..)
Cause elevation to celebration, I preach that dere
and that bullshit they've been servin y'all, I don't eat that dere
Keep that plate, I got my own
Don't test my patience, bitch I'm grown!
It ain't much you can tell me granny ain't already told me
...and she wasn't wrong, yeah we that strong
So fuck your umbrella, rainy weather, and all that shade
If God ain't want me to shine, he NEVER woulda let me chop on blades
So shine on

[Chorus]

[Bun B]
They say man make money, money don't make the man 
But it's a little bit of both
Cause it'll take some change, for you to make some change (yep) 
That ain't just some shit I wrote
Man that's natural fact and not evolution
My mind game still evolvin (hol' up)
And I'ma keep on rollin like 24s' and this world just keep revolvin
Good at problem solvin, cause I'm good at startin shit in first place
And it feels so good to be where I'm at man 
cause where I was was the worst place (uh)
But times change, so I keep hustlin
Boys tryna to make my time cease
But I'm laid back with my dime piece (what)
Shinin hard like my time piece and it's on

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Ain't no shinin, like we shinin 
(Shine baby, shine baby) 
Ain't no shinin, like we shinin 
(Shine baby, I need you come on one more time and shine baby)
Ain't no shinin, like we shinin 
(Shine baby, shine baby) 
Ain't no shinin, like we shinin 
(Won't you shine baby, I need you do it like you do it) 
Ain't no shinin, like we shinin 
(Shine baby, shine baby) 
Ain't no shinin, like we shinin 
(Shine baby, one mo' time for all my folk an' 'em)
Ain't no shinin, like we shinin 
(Shine baby, shine baby) 
Ain't no shinin, like we shinin, babe 
(They can't stop me from shinin on my own)

[Chorus]
