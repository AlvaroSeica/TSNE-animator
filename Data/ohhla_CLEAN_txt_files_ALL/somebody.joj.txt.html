[Intro: JoJo Pellegrino over phone recording]
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, uh, uh, yeah, yo

[JoJo Pellegrino]
If I pop you I pop you with a couple of shots
Would you stay off the blocks, retaliate, or run to the cops
You probably go to po po with it
Tell em 'Officer look, I ain't no rapper, but this shit hurts, JoJo did it'
I know your type, avoiding fist fights, always carry a knife
Feel like coughing til it's beef, then you get scared for your life
Got you kissing your wife at night after she gimme the brains
I'm on some DMX, You muthafuckas think it's a game
My gangstas speak the universal language, speaking for the prophets
Who walk around for months at a time with ??? in their pocket
This is war man, a vest ain't nothing to walk without
Shut up your face, the boss ain't nothing to talk about
?Baby Charlie's brother? strong cuz he gotta be focused
As I load the hallows and toasters, I'm like 'How did he know this?'
It's obvious, my mug shot's zero degrees celcius
My girl's right, the weed and the alcohol ain't helping shit, why

[Chorus: JoJo Pellegrino]
Cuz I just wanna murk somebody
I'm bout to hurt somebody
Pump supersoaker and squirt somebody
Dig a ditch for napping an desert somebody

[JoJo Pellegrino]
I fantasizing shit like I'm in a Scorsese flick
In the whip doing up a ???, plotting the perfect hit
Should I ski mask it, run up in the crib and just blast him
Kidnap his ass, have his faggot ass missing in ???
Maybe twist him on his lunch break from point blank range
How bout I knock him out, soak him with gas and set him aflame
Hit up the zoo and feed the scraps to the lions
My man got this machine in his butcher shop that'll have you back on your grind
Fuck, I stick you personally like take you for the shine
I ain't no homo, but I'm dying to bang you from behind
I know your boys hollering beef till the biscuits' poppin
Till I see em up in the mall with wifey, christmas shoppin
There's no remorse, I throw the heat to your bitch
Toss you into clear water so folks at home can watch you sleep with the fish
Fucking douchebag, stunting, now you caught up in beef
Wait till I catch you out without the stroller walking the street, faggot

[Chorus X2]

[JoJo Pellegrino]
(Punk you touch me your dead)
Shut your fucking mouth your prick, I'll put a slug to your head
You in no position to pop shit, anyways, I'm stressin
I had to much to drink today, so help me out when I'm not safe
What's with all these rumors I here about you lookin to get me?
Fears a bitch on my dick like the groupies that sweat me
Now look at you, pleading for your life (Oh you heard me beg)
Oh wise guy, blao blao blao blao (Ow, my fucking leg)
Keep yappin off at the lips, every word's a slug (fuck you)
Blao blao, dog I got twelve left in the clips
Now say your sorry (I'm sorry) ah ah, every word's a clip
Enough with the limbs, now your head's getting plugged
Me and you was cool, what happened to that?
Can't believe you got me diggin ditches, blowing gats and splatter your cap
Matter of fact blao, blao, blao, blao, blao, blao, blao, blao, blao, blao, blao, blao
It's time to take your third nap, goodnight</pre>
