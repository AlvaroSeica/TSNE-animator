[Chorus: Rich Homie Quan]
My, niggas, been, hustlin', tryin' to, make, him, somethin'
Ain't no telling what he'll do for the paper (ain't no tellin')
Souffl√©, I'm straight, I steak, my plate
Sade, I'm a +Smooth Operator+ (I drop the top of my whip baby!)
That car I'm driving make you feel some type of way (I know you do)
That custom Breitling make you feel some type of way (I'm shinin' hoe)
This bitch I'm with got me feeln' some type a way (okay, okay)
Is it because my homies rich you feel some type of way? (That Rollie too)
Some type of way, make you feel some type of way (some type of way)
Heard she wana fuck me, know you feel some type of way (some type of way)
Mr. CEO is what my title say (Rich Homie baby!)
Me and my homies did your ho, he feel some type of way

[Rich Homie Quan]
Okay now let's be real I know you feel some type of way (I know you do)
When I get to biting on her ear she make that Tyson face (don't look like that)
I drop down to my knees thankful for life today (thank you Lord)
No naps since long sleep; hibernate (leh'go, leh'go)
I can tell if he tell if he 12 (yeah), right away (don't fuck with them)
Go through hell cause I can, move you far away 
Drop you off late, know he feel some type of way (fuck that nigga)
I got hoes like golf trynna make what Tiger makes (that Wood baby)
I got a hide away (I do nigga), and I go there sometimes
to give my mind a break; I find a way (to do what?)
to still get through struggle, what I'm tryna say (okay, okay)
And I ain't lying today when i tell you that I love...

[Chorus]

[Rich Homie Quan]
She got a Georgia peach on her rear end like a licence plate (can't fuck wit'cho)
No rookie, girl scout cookie got me high today (I smoke good)
I probably make (okay), more money in six months
than what's in your papa's safe (I'm serious), look like I robbed a bank (okay, okay)
I +Set It Off+ like Queen Latifah, cause I'm +Living Single+ (that Stoney with me)
I'm feeling cautious, I ain't scream when they served a subpoena
I heard that he the leader, come follow my tribe today (come on)
I fucked her now he heated (hahaha), he feel some type of way (I don't give a fuck)
Don't know how to say, ain't I the hardest man working? (I know I am)
Attention we pay, there's always a man lurking (keep your eyes open)
No man perfect (nah), but God (yeah)
My head (okay), I nod (yes); Rich, Homie, ugh...

[Chorus]

[Outro]
I know you do...
Don't look like that...
Thank you, Lord...
Leh'go, leh'go...</pre>
