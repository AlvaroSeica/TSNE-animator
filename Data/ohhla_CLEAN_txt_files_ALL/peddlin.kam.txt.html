(Intro) Kamachi
Yeah, JuJu Mob, kno'm'sain
Kamach, kno'm'sain
African Kingpin, kno'm'sain
Hustling these melodies forever, kno'm'sain
Change the world with this music, nah'mean
My man Charon Don, yeah, JuJu Mob

[Chief Kamachi]
Yo, it's the velvet caine killer, I spark cooler
It's Young Dula - gold palace like a Baghdad ruler
Sipping blood and caluha, with some herb from Afrua
AK's ock, I got nuclear shit to do ya
Obliterated, no residue so the body count is fewer
I'm considerate; I give open caskets twice a year
Die before you; look at these hands, your life is there
My twin glocks, yo they're known as trifling pair
Hear shots in your dreams and you wake up and your wife's like...
"Honey calm down, that was just lightning there"
But the truth is that Kamach might be here
Straight killer, dressed in a God that the righteous wear
I'm a nigga that'll sell out heaven if the price is fair
Don't believe the hype cuz nigga your plight is near
Graffiti covered my crook in heavenly stairs
My rep is there, dirty chalice full of everclear
Raised in lock ass like a pittbull's pup
Never see me on the strip stuck
I don't kick fuck
I know the game like my mama know my name
I blow brains like fiends blow caine
I was born into the dope game
Sweat tubes and rope chains
Hustling nigga the world just know my show name
The block hot, but the boy hustle propane
Smokes at the corner bar, just like a Soul Train
Rocks glisten now they sweating my whole gang
Like the way I stroll North Philly soul theme
Sweating my jewels maybe these my old frames
Just royalty, killa puffs a flow caine

[Charon Don]
Alecrim, raised on day long Rakim
Judge me not cuz you ain't neva saw where I been
Hell without flames, way beyond Nextel's range
My necklace's frame below the microcell's in my veins
Oh my... show's wild what I bleed you read
So high... no guys could believe my steez
We the truth - selected to lead the youth
So what you do to the weed is what we do to the booth
This is head-trigger music, half nigga music
Something to blast for you sicker music
I rhyme with class, it's richer music
Don't confuse it, these punks is useless
I'm on the beat where the heat pumps thru speakers when boosting
Don't confuse it, these chumps is useless
I'm from the street where the heat speaks and few get excuses
Stupid! It's Chief Kamachi and Charon Don
It's impossible to stop me, that's like pause in God
I'm a pimp with knowledge so my mama sent me to college
Ever since everything I spit is been nauesas
Lyricism slash Prophet, ahead of my time
This for your grandchildren's kids as they sit and they vibe
So welcome to the game where the Ying meets the Yang
But seldom do the pains that we're in seize to change
Freak the beats, speak, keep 'em flame
With a sleek physique and keep a heat to aim
Repeat, repeat these waves
Eat defeat, the weak and lames
With a name that's so acclaimed you can't speak it in vain
Maintain, we try to drink, smoke, think and coke
Peddalin' music to survive while we eat these nuts
Listen...</pre>
