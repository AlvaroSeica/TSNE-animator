Typed by: Cno Evil

[Chorus: U-God]
Just' call me up, I'll be right there
Money folding up, I'll be right there
Wu throw it up, I'll be right there
If the world blow it up, I'll be right there
Nigga throw it up, I'll be right there
Just' call me up, I'll be right there
Wu throw it up, I'll be right there
I'll be right there, I'll be right there

[U-God]
Yeah, this is it, yo, the final chapter
Got your back, nigga, chiropractor
Fuck with my brother, gon' have to clap witcha
Mess with my brother, going back to Attica
He's the nucleus, I'm the reactor
War scar, Battlestar Gallactica
Solid gold, I'm a fold and package ya
Rap czar, I'm a rhythm trafficker
Up against the wall, I'mma sandwich ya
All star pro, you'se an amateur
Damage ya, bandage ya, examine ya, stamina
I love the fame, I love the props
I'm from the drug game, I hug the block
There's the stage, I'm ready to rock
Yo, RZA hit me up, when the mic gets hot

[Chorus]

[Hook 2X: U-God]
Set it up, I'll tear it down
Wet it up, I shake the town
Place your bet, I'mma lay it down
Ready, set, I'mma take the crown

[U-God]
I got the respect, when I hit the south
I'm the connect, yo, forget the drought
You cross me once, bitch, you out
Now ask yourself, what the grits about
I'mma chew you up, spit you out
You see this hard rock, nigga? Forget the doubt
Computer programmer, just click the mouse
I want 50k hits, nigga, watch the bounce
Now, to the ounce, I key the notes
Ya'll beating niggas, ya'll pumping soap
I'm eating niggas, I'm so cutthroat
Watch an one arm nigga just cut the dope

[Chorus]
