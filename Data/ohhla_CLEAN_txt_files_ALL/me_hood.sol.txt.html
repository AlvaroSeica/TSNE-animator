[Solomon Childs]
This dedicated to the boulevard hustlers
For them sales that jump over car hoods like Dan Glover
Housing lights reflect off of bobos
And Michael Jordan flourescent colors, times is hard
But it ain't bad that my sister's ain't boost
So my nieces can go to school on they first day cute
North Face furs on the ave., blowing piff on the ave.
It's funny, say nothing good coming out the streets nowadays
In the society's eyes, our park's ain't beautiful
We can't go ice skating, they say my corners are disintrigrating
But people who talk about the streets, 9 times out of 10
Are no longer holding down the streets
Yeah the fiends be cracked out, but you know what? It's still a hustle
And as long as I love it, I will not the struggle

[Chorus: Solomon Childs]
You see, you can take me out the hood
But you can't take the hood out of me
You see, the streets is all I got
But the streets'll have you build with power when you touch the top

[Solomon Childs]
From the pain of graffiti walls, globetrotter colored balls
Cleopatra twisses, Coretta King dreams and ambitions
Nefertitti bamboo's orientated
Skelli balls and names written in concrete that's unfaded
Timeless to those who made it, bottles on the awe from liquor stores
Stickers of every independent rap label on your bedroom doors
And I love the streets for the fish spots as well as the heat
So what you need to know, is bad karma brings beef
The streets don't draw beef, it's the knowledge that uphands
And develops a leader, brings class to a diva
All shades of caramel, the red bones
Ain't nothing like the hood when you in the zone
And I love my hood, and ain't never been afraid to walk home

[Chorus]

[Outro: Solomon Childs]
Ain't enough money in the world, man
Ain't enough money in the world, man
Ain't nothing gonna stop me, man
This is dedicated, to all my brothers coming up on the grind
Double up, getting they money, out in the cold weather
Getting that gwop up, man, trynna pay them bills
Hustle hard...</pre>
