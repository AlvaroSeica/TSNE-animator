one of the most highest potential of culture that relieves the spells of evil

Why? How?

[Peter Tosh]
Well it's so scientifical
I've been investigatin this word so long to find out what these words mean
And what they are for, cause in the beginnin was the word and the word was with Jah
And the word was Jah the same was in this time
cause so it was in the beginnin so it shall be in these days

[Reporter]
Okay

[Peter Tosh]
Well, I was born and raised and grown up
