Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
you say what you have to say and hurt me on the serio
then i'll I can think about to do is just to let you go
forget you I tell myself and quickly dry my eyes
ain't no reason to cry pick up my things and say goodbye
i can't do this any longer I been trying for a minute
but every time it's good, in a few we back up in it
arguing and throwing shit all over the house
saying if this is how it's gonna be that you'd rather bounce
i don't know what to say and so I close the door behind me
hoping that you have a change of heart to come and find me
then I fall asleep praying that I never have to see you
then I feel your arms around my waist and glad that I'm still with you baby

[Chorus]
stop it baby don't come too close
cause I'm already tempted to steal you baby
stop it baby don't come too close
cause I'm already tempted to steal you baby

[Verse 2]
sometimes you get me so upset that all I wanna do is leave you
never turn around so that my eyes don't have to see you
wish it be a lot easier for me to move along
but I get so weak around you couldn't bare to see you gone
it's like every time we fight, and you make me think it's over
you know how to calm me down and become the perfect lover
straight make me forget what were fighting about
you pull me right next to you just to clear any doubt
you lay me down and you make me realize how much I love you
even if just a second ago I didn't like you,
say I didn't mean it baby and I fall in love again it's a love and hate feeling that i'll never understand

[Chorus]
stop it baby don't come too close
cause I'm already tempted to steal you baby
stop it baby don't come too close
cause I'm already tempted to steal you baby

[Verse 3]
see I can never stay mad long enough to walk away
you know exactly what to do, you know exactly what to say
you know I can't keep myself from loving you down
can't keep my hands off of you when I have you around
so even when I say I hate you most of the time it's all good
crying as we making love got me thinking if I should
but I do it anyway cause you got me feeling right
and at the time all that I can think about is you so fine
so when it all comes down I let you come and make it up
it's the best thing knowing you ain't never giving up
yeah sometimes we might get into it and feel like we should part
but you know at the end of the day you got my heart carino

[Chorus]
stop it baby don't come too close
cause I'm already tempted to steal you baby
stop it baby don't come too close
cause I'm already tempted to steal you baby</pre>
