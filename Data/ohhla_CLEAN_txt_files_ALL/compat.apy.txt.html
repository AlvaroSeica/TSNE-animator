[Apathy]
No one can math the accuracy of Apathy
My brain thinks rapidly
Automatically adapted when competition is tapped into my
Mainframe, biting my styles like downloading files
But I react with raps that suckas hack
Y'all can get the scrotum
I manifest the cybernetic explosion
To overload your modem when I decode 'em
And bring the cryptic simplistic firewalls
I assault with fireballs
Through fiber optic lines in line with rhymes in cyberspace
My face print across the screen
Glow white-green digitizing a fight scene
In actual reality I'm sitting in my basement
In virtual reality I'm fighting +Matrix+ agents
On planet Earth I control your mind when I say shit
In cyberspace I control computers 'cause they're basic
Binary code talks with tons of zeroes and ones
?? the heroes begun to master their tongue
So I'm speaking to your Pentium
Beyond the new millenium
So ready your ??? ??? forms the data when I enter them
Digital, physical, spiritual and mathematical
You motherfuckers better be Apathy compatible
  
Digital, physical, spiritual and mathematical
You motherfuckers better be Apathy compatible
  
Digital, physical, spiritual and mathematical
You motherfuckers better be...
  
[Celph Titled]
Alias, max fabulous
My tongue attacks hazardous
Quantum leap continuously through time passages
I pull you right out the truck by your ear lobe
And throw you off the roof and still be considered you're hero
I'm hungry for the dinero
Don't make me see you
Vice grip your torso and squeeze you till you're see through
My fam is ??? while even my grandmoms'll snuff you
And ?? you up in a tussle and beat you with a belt buckle
I make Master P-ieces with enough Silkk to Shock shit
You can C-Murder, No Limitations when my glock spit
I get goosebumps after giving niggaz two lumps
Straight up fuck your shorty and leave that bitch with a loose cunt!
Celph Titled, the man with razor sharp talent
And accurate, authentic techniques to leave you off balance
With raw talent, my rhymes will shatter through your physical
Repeat my voice in digital, ???? ??? ????
The Rubix Cuban, sell out in every vinyl store
Don't make lift your skull and have to whip you with your spinal chord
My skills will keep your ears open, like a Vulcan
And put you out of work like Chevy Chase and Macaulay Culkin
Digital, physical, spiritual and mathematical
You motherfuckers have better be Celph compatible
  
Digital, physical, spiritual and mathematical
You motherfuckers have better be...
  
Just give me a chance to explain
I'm enhanced in the brain
Hip hop MC, b-boy stance ingrained
In my neural fabric
Fuck internet static
My status is static free
Now imagine me
Sweating what they say about the AP
I'll never let it faze me
'Cause y'all are soft as Teletubbies and Beanie Babies
For MC's I kill ? ?? ??
But you can still never see me like ??? ???
Got your shorty in a Ford Explorer
To explore her
Give her foreplay, make her beg for more and ignore her
I store a backup disk of every diss
Scroll down a long list
Click to inflict ?? ?? ??? ?? ??
Computating the data that could be badder that lets it out of my mouth
In every rhyme bout I'm victorious
'Cause I train with The Brain
Jumping jacks with raps laborious work
Like a wrestler
I'm ripping through your shirt
Body slam your mind in the dirt
Suckers get hurt, jerk
Digital, physical, spiritual and mathematical
You motherfuckers better be Demigod compatible
  
Digital, physical, spiritual and mathematical
You motherfuckers better be Demigod compatible
  
Digital, physical, spiritual and mathematical
You motherfuckers better be Demigod compatible</pre>
