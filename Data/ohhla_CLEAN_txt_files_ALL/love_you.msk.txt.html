Song:   Love You Till Death
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Don't you dare go away from me
I love you so damn much boy why can't you see
I rather see you dead than with somebody else
love is quick to break me down

[Ms Krazie]
I couldn't stand it I rather see you dead than with somebody else
can't you see how much I love you cause you need to
maybe then you wouldn't even consider leaving
not something that you wanna do believe me
I've been with you for too many years to change it
and the day you said forever I replay it every second
you can't take it back i'm sorry your stuck with me
whether you like it or not that's how its gonna be

[Chorus]
your love is killing me slowly
It's way beyond what's sacred and holy
If I can't have you
I'll make sure that no one will
I'ma love you till death
I'ma love you till death

[Kozme]
I can't believe the news today
wish I can close my eyes and make this go away
how long how long must we sing this song
how long how long

[Chorus]
your love is killing me slowly
It's way beyond what's sacred and holy
If I can't have you
I'll make sure that no one will
I'ma love you till death
I'ma love you till death

[Chorus - Ms Krazie]
don't you dare go away from me
I love you so damn much boy why can't you see
I rather see you dead than with somebody else
love is quick to break me down.

[Chorus]
your love is killing me slowly
It's way beyond what's sacred and holy
If I can't have you
I'll make sure that no one will
I'ma love you till death
I'ma love you till death</pre>
