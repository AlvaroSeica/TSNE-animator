[Chorus]
I'm not tryin to be, no big thing (I'm not tryin to be no big thing)
I'm not tryin to give you, no advice (I can't tell you how to live your life blud)
I'm not tryin to be, no big thing (no role models up in here, what?)
I'm not tryin to give you, no advice

[Verse 1]
blud I'm not sayin that I'm anything, who am I to give man advice?
It's not that I know best, when trust blud I don't
all I know is if your comin from this manor I'm from
You'll find nuff man'll test ya don't think they won't
everybody is on their own little hustle just to find a way to try get thru
when your raised in this fuckry
and if your makin some papes on these estates man'll try and get you
so you run and grab your bucky
You count your blessins everyday but still accept you'll have to take your loses
It's money that your makin
especially if your comin up in the ranks
against the big crime bosses that are all sittin hatin
the jealous ones'll always envy so you dare say it now who wants it
let them fuckers spite ya
they're out to get you so you get them first
And look now uve done it cause your arrived in a lifer
stop

I'm not tryin to be, no big thing (man ain't tryin to be nothing big blud)
I'm not tryin to give you, no advice (I can't really tell you how to live your life, get me)
I'm not tryin to be, no big thing (nuttin big star)
I'm not tryin to give you, no advice

[Verse 2]
I'm from a manor where the last 20yrs have been infested
by the crack-cocaine, that you'll find man endeavourin
to come down from the ? man are shovin needles in thier vein
with juice full up of heroin
we are all stuck in this struggle but its not as if we can't see
that nuff mans out there shottin work
they use it for an escape as if its really gonna set man free
when we are still diggin in the dirt
the schools are underacheivin in the grades so its minumum wage
by the time you go to look a job
but on the streets we are learnin every other aspect of the criminal trade
so instead we gonna look to rob
It's like a gamble for your life on this manor so you hope that you win
or else you'll just be runnin shook
and I can't tell you how to live any better I ain't no big ting
trust me listen to the hook
look

I'm not tryin to be, no big thing (I'm not tryin to be no big thing)
I'm not tryin to give you, no advice (I can't tell you how to live your life at all)
I'm not tryin to be, no big thing (I ain't tryin to be no biggie blud)
I'm not tryin to give you, no advice

[Verse 3]
so what's the method for the madness
for any of these kids who get left out on these streets
where you find evrybody's frettin
and walkin round with screw faces thinkin that
pure bad beefs is all their likely plan to getting
don't let anybody get in your way
from tryin to chase your dreams blud, whatever they might be
You've got to go for whatever you wanna be no matta
if that might seem however unlikely
if you don't go make a start for the betta then your shit won't change
and you'll just get left behind
and end up like so many brothers who still out here
goin insane feelin' like they've lost their mind
so get lost in the dust if your not goin to make your start
instead of just sittin and wishin
nobodys getting any younger so you know
you 'av to play your part
if you wanna betta your position
listen

I'm not tryin to be, no big thing
I'm not tryin to give you, no advice
I'm not tryin to be, no big thing, no no
I'm not tryin to give you, no advice</pre>
