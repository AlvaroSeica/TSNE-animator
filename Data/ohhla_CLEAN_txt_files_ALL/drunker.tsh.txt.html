I get drunk and I stumble to the mic
Stay drunk all week, I'm at my Peak like Pike
I'm never at my peak, I'm killin fifth after fifth
I drink mo' 40's than Tash and E-Swift (hell naw!!)
Uh-huh, I drink more than both of y'all (no you don't!)
I hold more liquor than a bank on Crenshaw
And Tash you can't drink brew, you know you the nigga who (WHAT?)
be all on yo' nads, after just a swig or two

[Tash]
Nigga you trippin, must be that Zima you was sippin
Yo' accountant couldn't count how many bottles I be grippin
and flip it in the trash cause I downed em with ease
while you on yo' knees -- about to pass somebody yo' keys
I even had to pay the taxi (what?) the last time you asked me (uh)
You start off on yo' feet but always wind up on yo' back G
Bro you should know you can't drink with Ri-co
While you down yo' shit slow, I'm on my ninth Cuervo

[E-Swift]
Aiyyo at every single show, you be layin on the flo'
Swearin up and down, you neva gonna drink no mo'
But I get to' up, from the flo' up, and never throw up
One little wine cooler and you wanna beat yo' hoe up
I never call it quits, I don't know my own limit
This Alkaholik shit is for real, it ain't a gimmick
You might fuck around and catch a liver disease
fuckin with these Likwit MC's, Hip-Hop Drunkies

	Don't you think it's bout time (time)
	to get yo' drink on, whatcha wanna do
	Don't you think it's bout time (time)
	to get yo' fade on.. with the Likwit crew

[J-Ro]
Yo, I pledge allegiance to the bottle, the cup and the can
In front of the bar, that's where I stand
And to the alcohol, for which I fall
and the cold porcelain in the bathroom stall
One drunk nation under God inebriated
with liberty and justice to anyone who's faded
Drink drink drunk until I can't hack it
Until the little man fall off the horse on my Polo jacket
("When I get drunk..")  *BURRRRRRRRP*  Once again
I spent all my yen on ten bottles of gin
Likwit til I'm stiff, damn I love this riff
The Ro gotta go, I pass the mic to E-Swift

[E-Swift]
I drink a lot of beers, my life's a black version of Cheers
Everyday sit at the bar and take shots with my peers
I've been doin this for years, ain't no amateurs here
I've been drinkin 40's longer than most niggaz careers
I've got the bitches grinnin while the whole world is spinnin
You suffer from double vision and I'm just beginnin
You always pass out, wake up, and don't remember me
You could write a book with all your hangover remedies
I thought you knew, I've been drinkin since high school
While I down this Olde English, you sippin your O'Douls
I'm makin beer runs at ten minutes to two
while you still sippin on your first motherfuckin brew

	Don't you think it's bout time (time)
	to get yo' drink on, whatcha wanna do
	Don't you think it's bout time (time)
	to get yo' fade on.. with the Likwit crew

[Tash]
Aight, uhh, uhh, uhh
A lot of niggaz can't drink, but hoes is even worse
They order three drinks but can't finish the first
I see em reachin in they purse about to roll that sack of weed
knowin that's the combination that they really don't need
Cause girls take a sip, get fucked up quick
Pass out, wake up, ("What's this??")  It's a DICK!!
Baby girl you lookin sick, you lookin plastered like a poster
You was talkin all that shit, now you need some Alka Seltzer
You wobblin, weeblin, fuckin up your eve-nin
That smoke that you breathin got that ass on spin
while yo' homegirls is like, ("Where the fuck you been?")
In the girl's bathroom, fucked up since ten
Yeah I seen her, she thought she was a graceful ballerina
Now that ass is too drunk to drive herself to the marina
So she comin home with me because, I don't give a fuck
Might fuck an ugly bitch, but "Only When I'm Drunk"

	Don't you think it's bout time (time)
	to get yo' drink on, whatcha wanna do
	Don't you think it's bout time (time)
	to get yo' fade on.. with the Likwit crew
	Don't you think it's bout time (time)
	to get yo' drink on, whatcha wanna do
	Don't you think it's bout time (time)
	to get yo' fade on.. with the Likwit crew

[Tash]	You're all fucked up now!
	Like this y'all

(*E-Swift cuts and scratches "when I get drunk"*}

[Tash]	We doin big thangs, knahmsayin?
	Ha ha, we fucked up now!
	You know what's goin down, Alkaholiks
	Got my niggaz up in this motherfucker
	My niggaz and you know it
	I ain't solo.. I ain't dolo..</pre>
