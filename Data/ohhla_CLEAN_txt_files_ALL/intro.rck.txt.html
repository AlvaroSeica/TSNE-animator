"Yeah, I've done a lotta things wrong
 I'm not gon' say I never done nothing wrong now
 Shit, nobody HERE can never say they never done nothin wrong
 You probably- Y'ALL couldn't never say you done nothin wrong, right?
 (Right...) Well then so, y'know hey... Before I got.. 
 Hey, I'ma about, I'm about like um the last... nomads that came in, y'know?
 And before that, y'know, I was just like a take-off artist, y'know
 I used to run around takin off people, throwin 'em thru windows
 and shit like that, y'know.. Beatin 'em up
 But me and Joe, see I knew Joe since me and Joe grew up together from school, y'know?
 And I moved around and I got down and I found Joe as the president of the nomads
 So I got down with Joe, y'know?"</pre>
