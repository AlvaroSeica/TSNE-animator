I, Common, IiI, common (*repeat 4X*)

I'm writing in my book
Wit a simple pleasure
Or is it necessary
Just to document this measure of time
Whether defined or not
I'm gonna find the top
Of my personal climbing rock
Take a verse of what I'm about
Break it down
I just rhyme about den
And da secrets I'm finding out
And dats alright ain't it
Look how bright I painted experience
Gain it, maintain it
Same heinous crimes Of Sam Hein
They won't wane
Eh pay the fine
And sometime I campaign
Champagne and Rap
You're bottling flat dude
Forget all that
It's concentrate on the great
We gonna do this
Tough like Buddhist
Who this fool sitting in big chairs
Spot light blew it up
Smooth as cup of Caffeine
Chapters got snatched up by Napster
Jimmy Caster
Use to get wasted away like Jimmy Buffet
And I'm dam sure
It wasn't cool
Now I ain't buzzin fool
Like That
Light that Rit
Bite that bottom lip
I gotta be a somebody
Even if you gotta trip

[Chorus]
We are floating in the sky
Here today and gone by Niiiii
We all try but don't know why
There's no answers it's all liiiiiiiiiiiiiiife. Liiiiiiiiiiiiife
It's the Magnitude
Liiiiiiiiiiiiiife, Liiiiiiiiiiiife (I common IiI common)
It's the Magnitude
Liiiiiiiiiife, Liiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiife (I common IiI common)

It's truly just me in this
No one seeing dis
Pitted against the grain
For the whole world domain
Don't tell me that I put too much music out
Look at them jazz fools
This is jazz too
This is black music
No crack, no gat, no lack of compassion
Fools get zooted too much
I can't do much to change there minds
I guess I can't influence
I'm just tryin to unwind
Find a line of attack, with tact
Cracked the coffee
They crack whatever like
Genetic Codes to make robots with controlled souls
That's not new news
You've seen the weirdness
Moka is a Scorpio
Climbing through the clearing
In the woods on the hill top
Breathing pine scented
Someone gotta take the next step
So I invented
You, turn around say I'm demented
Cause no one else is doing it
But I'm a free soul
And you resent it

[Chorus]

We are floating in the sky
Here today and gone by Niiiii(night)
We all try but don't know whhhhhhhhy
There's no answers it's all liiiiiiiiiiiiiiife
It's the Magnitude
Liiiiiiiiiiiiiife, Liiiiiiiiiiiife (Ya, I common IiI common)
It's the Magnitude
Liiiiiiiiiife, Liiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiife (Ya, I common IiI common)
It's the Magnitude
Liiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiife (Ya, I common IiI common)
It's the Magnitude
Liiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiife (Ya, I common IiI common)
It's the Magnitude
Liiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiife (Ya, I common IiI common)

Crack the can of worms
Free flow the ink
In a matter of minutes
So I don't lose my think
Burnt brain cells
From previous years of abuse
Keep my last few close
To avoid the news
Watching Bruce Willis on a Blockbuster night
That's me
To taxi to wax spots
Where ya ass be
Ask me
To rhyme witcha
I may, just be fresh for god's sake
That I'm slipping off to a lake
Do I make any of you
Feel Exhiliration?
If so that's my purpose
To thrill the nation
Not to big, just grand enough
With mad distribution
And women need to start the substitution
Get rid of that wack shit
We got the substance girl
DM, I'm above this world
One Man outfit, producer, MC, composer
Already traveled millions of miles
On this coaster

[Chorus]

We are floatin in the skkkkkkkkky
Here today and gone by niiiiiiiiiiii
We all try but don't know whhhhhhhhy
Deres no answers its all liiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiife
We are floatin in the skkkkkkkkky
Here today and gone by niiiiiiiiiiii
We all try but don't know whhhhhhhhy
There's no answers its all liiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiife
It's the magnitude
Liiiiiife
It's the magnitude
Liiiiiiiife - (* repeat "I common IiI common" throughout chorus*)
Ya, ya, ya
Liiiiiiiiife
Ya, ya, ya
Liiiiiiiiife
Ya, ya, ya
Liiiiiiiiife
Ya, ya, ya
Liiiiiiiiife
Ya, ya, ya
Liiiiiiiiife
A yigi, yigi, yigi
Liiiiiiiife</pre>
