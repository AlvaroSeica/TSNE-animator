[DAN-E-O]
Where does your conscience dwell since the world's gone to hell?
Can't imagine how the people who were held hostage felt
Time for those songs you tell to be left on the shelf
Play like a website bwoy: just calm yourself
The twin towers was crumblin', got me steady wonderin'
What more will it take for you to stop menial rumblin'?
How you gonna answer when the voice of God is thunderin'?
"What did you do with what I gave you to stop the sufferin'?"
I mean, what's gettin' high? You could be the next to die
What's ice when terrorism got the world petrified?
What's having the nicest ride when your nation's throwin' bombs?
And what's your song when it's part of what's goin' wrong?
You see what I'm saying is reality is stashed
In the back to allow for the breeding ground for trash
You claim you smokin' niggaz but you nuttin' but the ash
I hope you're counting includes blessings with your cash!

[CHORUS]
Give Jah praise, give Jah praises!
Give Jah praise cuz true love is amazing!

[BLESSED]
Love to see the pretty girl dem a jiggle yo
Especially when dem a wine and ah wiggle
Two a dem a mob Bless, me itch up in a di middle yo
Crack a joke and di two a dem a giggle
Dem nah go blow no man like flute nor fiddle yo
Mouth fresh and it nah stink like pickle
Dem a say me big and me nah likkle like a nickel yo
Ah say mi good me nah make dem run a trickle

[LINDO P]
Make di fire blaze, blaze
You know say rasta youth, say we no 'fraid, 'fraid
Go make this fire, make this fire blaze, blaze
You know say rasta youth, say we no 'fraid, 'fraid
Hey yo, everywhere mi go, mi hear man talk 'bout dem a shotta
Woman wear no clothes, cha, something nah proper
Tell me what's the matter, nastiness ah wha dem catch ya
Dem ah go feel di rapture put themself in ah disaster
Righteousness is what I'm after, check out the master blaster
Hair it never braid up and you know that I'm a rasta
Nah go nyam di pork, and mi bun out all imposter
We could move slow but righteous youth ah move faster

[CHORUS] - 2X

[SPIDAHMAN]
In the party, kid died in the club
Next week, everybody still throwin' they hands up
Soundbwoy pack the sound up move the dance to the morgue
Let's see which rudebwoy play the wall like he core
"Blood pon yuh shoulder!" sleeve lookin' wet
Y'all only say it's live when a nigga praising death
Youth man, tell your two friends, "cool bred'"
Simmer and keep a cool head, we came to party, not to see a fool dead
Who said it's easy? Make a nest egg out a goose egg
Even in the spotlight, niggaz act like new bread
Got a choose, step wise, dude take time, when you do get shine
You never gon' get bligh, messin' with them reptiles
Yes child, this be the lyrical negro spiritual
Off the chain like the slave that got away, here we go

[CHORUS] - 2X</pre>
