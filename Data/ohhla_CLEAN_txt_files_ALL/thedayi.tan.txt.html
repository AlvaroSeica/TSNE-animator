[Donwill]
Yo; yhe day I woke up was this one, so
I can't sit and play the victim, no
way will I waste another day in the place
where I just wanna run from
Uhh, another day another dollar
But the day that I squander is the day that I pawn the
memories remembering the day that I promised
myself, I'd el-evate, but cain't
The day

[Von Pea]
Secondhand blessings, shadowin and hope
Shallow in approach
Lookin to win without dimmin our inner glow
Within the city limits the mission appears a joke
Nobody chucklin I'm duckin any fear but yo
It's not a Sunday morning
It's more than money or people wantin the sons of Morgan
Sortin pros and cons, everything Sumner taught him
So when he up and solvin come applaud him

[Donwill]
Yo~! The day I played the my first record for my moms (go on)
was the day that I decided my effort
would multiply with work, so much for findin work
cause I decide my worth! This has gotta work
The day I put in my two weeks
I was scared as hell wonderin how I'ma eat, BUT
the way that I see it, the day that I achieved it
was the day I decided to be it, and see it's
The day

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Today, I feel I'm fallin but I'll make it out
I give my all to it, it just take a bounce
You drain, I'll change; however
My day's lookin better, my day's lookin better</pre>
