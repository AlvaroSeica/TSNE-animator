[Ghetto E]
On my block it don't stop

[Hook - 2x]
Fresh out the good-ship, my lollipops
After I cop, go cop me a drop top
After that, I'm headed straight for the Rollie shop
On my block it don't stop
Getcha money player!

[Ghetto E]
How much candy can I sell up on the block
My stores never close, they open around the clock
It's time to take a trip to the good-ship lollipop
Don't stop, getcha money player!
Flipping Alexander the Grapes, pay me Now or Later
Lemonheads chasin' my candy paint for the flavor
Go to cop, to set up shop on 5th Avenue
Crackerjack and his Nutty Buddy they be fallin' through
Puffin' Laffy Taffy, sittin' in Little Debbie's house
Her Baby Boop'll go to sleep, so now I'm bowlin' out
Hit the strip joint, lookin' for me some Kit-Kat
Raisinet gift and then I Hershey Kisses up in the back
I'll enjoy you when the Tootsie Roll on the pole
Mike &amp; Ike freak in the back and there go Oreo
Aiyyo, aiyyo!
Can't stay out long, I'm going home
It's time to hit the block
My man got them yum Dum-Dum drops, and they come

[Hook - 2x]
Fresh out the good-ship, my lollipops
After I cop, go cop me a drop top
After that, I'm headed straight for the Rollie shop
On my block it don't stop
Getcha money player!

[Ghetto E]
Hood-wide, open, hopin' to flip a 100-Grand
Rock candy won't melt up in your mouth or in your hand
Money wraped in rubberbands, we call 'em Rolos
Cause you know we gots to get the Pillsbury Dough
Page Mr. Goodbar, told me meet me at the Jolly Rancher
Doin' eighty on the Noogie, way that nigga got there
I pray to God he wasn't wired with no 'Ubble Bubble
We will brake his Sweet Tarts off if he got in trouble
Got him out of jail on the double, he back on the grind
"Now who's Bazooka Joe" I don't know, he ain't a friend of mine
"He called about some Blow Pops", stop that might be one time
Tryin to get a buy, but I refuse to let him cop mine
It's hard to stop the Candyman from walkin' in his cash-shoes
Because the Candyman he had to stand that the cash rules
Can't stay out long, I'm going home, it's time to hit the block
My man got them yum Dum-Dum drop, and they come

[Hook] 3x to fade
Fresh out the good-ship, my lollipops
After I cop, go cop me a drop top
After that, I'm headed straight for the Rollie shop
On my block it don't stop
Getcha money player!</pre>
