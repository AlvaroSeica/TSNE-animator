Typed by: AZ Lyrics

A giant eye zapped across the screen
With tentacle type feeler type thin roots
Reaching for someone maybe me
With large black block letters
Chiseled into the white around the pupils screaming
R e v o l u t i o n
Revolution
And as the eye giant and green
Sort of oozed with no obvious locomotion
Closer and closer until it was like this on my screen
It split and blood flowed down each side of the street
Washing away things that we didn't need to see
Just like beer cans peanut shells and copies of the daily news
And then laying there, bleeding like a stuck pig
Was a stuck pig
Get the point?</pre>
