Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Gimme pound gimme pound gimme euro gimme yen [x2]
I'm international baby [x2]
I'm international pay me

Gimme pound gimme pound gimme euro gimme yen [x2]
I'm international baby [x2]
I'm international pay me - pay me

I bet she likes it pretend (that your just a tease)
She said now and again (that your just a tease)
She saw you long long time (come on girl come with me please)
I said come on girl quite playing (you know your coming with me)

And when the music bash my heart beating fast
Until she turns up on my shirt so I follow
To a back room were she at
Oh, shes there in a stance and she held out her hand and said

Gimme pound gimme pound gimme euro gimme yen [x2] (huh)
I'm international baby [x3]
I'm international pay me

Gimme pound gimme pound gimme euro gimme yen [x2] (huh)
I'm international baby [x3]
I'm international pay me

Electric red leather boots, worked up to her thighs
Undid a zipper or two n she gave me a smile
I ain't a fein or a fool but I guess I'm caught in desire
Never did this before but I'm ready to go

And when the music bash my heart beating fast
Until she turns up on my shirt so I follow
To a back room were she at
Oh, shes there in a stance and she held out her hand and said

Gimme pound gimme pound gimme euro gimme yen [x2] (huh)
I'm international baby [x3]
I'm international pay me

Gimme pound gimme pound gimme euro gimme yen [x2] (huh)
I'm international baby [x3]
I'm international pay me

Gimme pound gimme pound gimme euro gimme yen [x3] (huh)
I'm international baby
I'm international pay me
Umm do you take cheque</pre>
