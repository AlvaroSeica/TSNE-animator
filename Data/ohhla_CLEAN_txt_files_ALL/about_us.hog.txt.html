[Paul Wall]
Boys talkin down
On the sidelines watchin wishin they was playin the game we playin
But it's all good though; Paul Wall
Brooke what up baby?

[Brooke Hogan] + (Paul)
What's it to you Paul Wall? Yeah (naw)
Now who's talkin? (naw)

[Paul Wall]
Okay, hey... what it do?
I hear the commentators on the side chatterboxin
Paul Wall and Brooke got all the paparazzi watchin
I hear 'em jaw-jappin, bumpin gums, chasin crumbs
We ain't concerned with the bums, we accumulatin funds
Flash the wrist, got the Johnny Dane watch froze
Five karat with the yellow stone in my earlobe
I'm squashin chatter when the light hit the pinky ring
Starched and clean, white cup full of lean
See me in that new Benz cause I'm also ballin
Or a old school slab with the fifth wheels fallin
We got 'em talkin, but really they ain't sayin too much
Just speculatin with they gossip
Truth is, they don't know about us

[Brooke Hogan] + (Paul)
I see your lips movin but I don't hear nothin (naw)
Everybody actin like they really know somethin 'bout us
(They don't know baby) But they don't know nothin 'bout us
(They don't know baby, they don't know about it)
I see your lips movin but I don't hear nothin (naw)
Everybody's actin like they really wanna know about us
(They don't know baby) But they don't know nothin 'bout us
(They don't know about you baby, talk to 'em Brooke)

[Brooke]
I'm just tryin to live, but you're all up in my grill
How's a girl to breathe with the media
starin down my mouth, with a fo' inch lens
I just wanna hit the mall with some of my friends

[Paul Wall]
They talkin 'bout us so I guess we doin somethin right
Ballin in the mix with the camera lights shinin bright
They know we caked up, but they don't know how much we worth
Paper stacked to the ceilin all because we put in work

[Brooke Hogan] + (Paul)
Picture yourself in my shoes (uh) top story in the news
Everyday it's something new, everybody's watching you (f'real)
But they ain't seen nothing (naw) they ain't heard nothing (naw)
Everybody's just fronting, it's what they do

[Brooke Hogan]
I see your lips movin but I don't hear nothin (no!)
Everybody actin like they really know somethin 'bout us
(They don't know about us) But they don't know nothin 'bout us
(They don't know about us, nooooo)

[Brooke Hogan] + (Paul)
I see your lips movin but I don't hear nothin (naw)
Everybody's actin like they really wanna know about us
(They don't know baby) But they don't know nothin 'bout us
(They don't know about you baby)

[Brooke Hogan]
Stop stop stop! I'm not listening, you can save your breath
I don't wanna, hear the rumors people are spreading
Why, why, why do people go, out of their way
To try to bring us down, they don't know nothin 'bout us

[Brooke Hogan] + (Paul)
I see your lips movin but I don't hear nothin (naw)
Everybody actin like they really know somethin 'bout us
(They don't know baby) But they don't know nothin 'bout us
(They don't know baby, they don't know about it)
I see your lips movin but I don't hear nothin (naw)
Everybody's actin like they really wanna know about us
(They don't know baby) But they don't know nothin 'bout us
(They don't know about you baby, naw)

[Paul Wall]
They don't know baby, naw {*to fade*}</pre>
