[* Gun being cocked *]

[Hook x3]
AK's and semi-automatic users
We some southern, country boys don't let that fool ya
Niggas that I run with will bring it to ya
Nigga take it to the streets and I'll do ya

[Verse 1]
Doctors say my mind gone from gettin' my grind on
Pullin' hoes still in the Nissan from when it was on
Y'all niggas don't know how wild it get
If ya think I'm talkin' shit bitch place ya bet
Niggas know not to ask me why I did it
A nickel bag gets sold in the park, I want in it
Roll slow in the Tahoe with the windows tinted
Hot rocks, heard the pop, don't stop get it, get it
Everybody hit it slow, blindfold hit the floor
Who wanna be the first to go, let me know
Don't you hate to see the gat up in your face like that
Boy I'd hate to see your brains all over the place like that

[Hook x2]

[* Pause *]

[Verse 2]
My niggas play you all, do some shit ya never saw
Slice em' open like a cigar, dude'll leave em' hangin' out his car
Burn him with gasoline, light up the scene
For the cops to watch, fill up the block
Let the nosey people count the shots
Thinkin' bout the plots that was unseen, that was in ya dreams
I bust twice then I heard ya scream
Now we fiends for paramedics, well forget it you'll never get it
Between you and me, life slips away if ya let it
Nigga fight, stay calm and pull that trigger
It happens so fast, don't freeze up, move that finger
If a 89 or AK or Ruger nigga
You the last man standin' then you the nigga

[Hook x2]
