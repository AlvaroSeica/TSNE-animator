[Intro: DJ Kay Slay] 
Yo Pap yo son what you doin out here this late son?

[Papoose]
Ain't nothin I came to the 24 hour store and all that out here fuckin playin dice with these niggas man

[DJ Kay Slay]
And you know my style man I was just makin in rain in The Golden Lady I'm 'bout take it in man

[Papoose]
Yeah me too man 

[DJ Kay Slay]
Yeah it's like four in the mornin man, take it in God 

[Papoose]
It's 4 o'clock yeah let me go get some rest

[Verse One: Papoose]
Aiyyo I left the corner four in the mornin, henny'd up
Hit the crib tumbled down the stairs, pick me up
Overheard my own people plannin to hit me up
And they ain't even know I was listenin, silly fucks
(Papoose be stuntin, yo son tear his kidneys up)
(And clap him on top of his head that's if he ducks)
I dug in my pocket so I could load the milli up
And all I fet was philly blunts I'm pissy drunk
Body me? How could it be? We blood brothers
We hid behind the same cars when slugs hovered
We talked about the future and risin above hunger
But now you got envisions of makin this thug suffer?
Thinkin what could have made him flip?
Is he a Blood and and he think I'm Crip? Is he in love and I hit his chick?
No time to think creep like a night burglar
'Cause for my life I'll incite murder vice versa
I bust through the door ready to let my iron boom
I'm a turn his livin room to the dyin room
Turn the bathroom to the blastroom
Bedroom to the dead room fled left him red dead doom

[Interlude: DJ Kay Slay] (Papoose)
{*Cell phone rings*}
Aiyyo Pap! 'Member that kid you had beef with back in '94? (What about him?)
Yeah well that coward nigga home now, he talkin reckless (Word?!)
Yo meet me uptown so I can kick it with you (No doubt!)
You know how it's gonna go down!

[Verse Two: Papoose]
Word in the ghetto this kid I had drama with before
Insane Tone just came home he wanna war
That black on black crime is swine truthfully
But if my brother try to do me I have to empty five in his Kufi
Who plottin to shoot me gotta be looney tryin to go against my block with the tooly
That's like an ox to a uzi
Found out where one of them lived, so we hopped in the hoopty 
Hit his crib, caught him in the bathroom watchin a movie
I asked him a few questions he tried to fool me
So I electrocuted him I kicked the TV inside of the jacuzzi
Some naked cutie ran in the room screamin don't shoot me
My bullets hit her dead in the cootie came out her booty
I grabbed this chick name Rudy, put it to her doobie
And made her tell me where the rest of the crew be
Soon as we left the other spot  (Yo park the car in the other block)
(Keep it runnin  'cause if they see us comin I'm dumbin out)
Shut the fuck up! I'm runnin the shots
In fact black you take the mac back or clack pass back, the other glock
Hopped out of the car gats cocked, ready to rock
Pulled right up through the side of us a off duty cop
I told him let's make a deal, split it partially
You don't disrespect my robbery I won't disconnect your arteries
He pulled off and didn't bother me, sort of heartened me
My niggas by the car with me screwin 'em with authority
Bum rushed our way in the door ragin for war
Wavin the four, y'all know what this is stay on the floor
I picked one of them up and put his face to the wall
Told him I want the gun, the drugs, jewels, papers and all
But he stalled, he tried to lie and say some chick had it
Soon as he said his word is bong I gave him a miscarriage
Put the money in the big bag and
I saw two other dreads on the floor chit chattin and slick actin
I told 'em I'll pitch if you flinch faggot!
When strong grabbed the big ratchet from Flip's jacket and shit shattered
We walked out of the buildin holdin cases of loot
When we made it off the stoop, niggas was blazin off the roof
My man tumbled down the basement steps
Grabbed him by his shoulder turned him over, looked in the face of death
He was shakin, stressed, tremblin, sighin and shit
I took the money out his pocket no sense of dyin with this
Cocked the hammer off my iron and spit
Heard everybody cryin I'm hit, my whole life relied on my clip
Ran out of bullets niggas pullin up behind me in whips
Bat me down looked around, all my crimies was hit
To all the thugs still breathin, take a deep breath
He who live the street life shall die a street death

[Outro: Papoose]
{*Gunshots*} THUGA!!!! {*Heavy Breathing*} TO BE CONTINUED!
