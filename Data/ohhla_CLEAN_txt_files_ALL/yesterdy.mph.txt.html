[Hook]
Was a war goin on in my head I wasn't ready for
Whole lot that went unsaid, not anymore
I kept it inside instead, no settled score
Wanted to break the bread, never stepped forward
War goin on in my head, wasn't ready for
Whole lot that went unsaid, not anymore
Kept it inside instead, no settled score
Wanted to break the bread, never stepped

[Verse 1]
Shoved in a dark place, floor made of rodents
Murmur in the heartbeat, I'm hardly outspoken
But I'm up on stage with ribcage ripped open
In depths like Johnny Depp, fear and loathing
And I wonder if I screamed, would they hear me chokin?
Short of oxygen, common man here smokin
Pitch black, but watching the walls start to close in
Shards of hourglass, at last sand dune corrosion
I sat and stared as the high horses rode in
I could never be prepared for the hope that broke in
I could smell the light as it slowly, slightly soaked in
Through a tiny opening beneath the door
Frightenin the rats from the floor
I was captivated by the fact that there was more
Than a basement to keep these secrets stored
And these faces were never meant to be ignored
And the hatred should've escalated when you made it yours
There's a shame in the self-blame and the fake applause
But this basement is spacious, a place to withdraw

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Distraught, pause, wonder when it all stops
Like lookin down the barrel of a sawn-off
Interrupted by the triple, simple, door knock
Tryna tap into my very own Fort Knox
Suddenly a crowbar clawed the locks off
Bright light blinding and it hit the sore spot
The hinges torn from the torso of where it all goes
Now it's all on for anyone to walk along
All exposed birthday suit at a fork in the road
A warning to those close, we all have our very own ghosts
From the smooth sail to the rough riding rodeo
A stone's throw to going home, slowly roam free
Confiding in the ones that seem to know me
At first hesitant to let 'em in, self exposing
See this weakness? Treat it like it's glowing
Knowin that they wouldn't and they didn't, it
Could've been paranoid, thinkin, sinkin through
Threw in a rope and that's hope for persistence
Small steps make the basement change positions

[Bridge] {X3}
And no matter how fast I ran, couldn't get away
No matter how hard I drank, still yesterday
Took me a helpin hand to get a better place</pre>
