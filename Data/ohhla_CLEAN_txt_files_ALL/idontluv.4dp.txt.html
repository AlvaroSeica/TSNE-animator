[ VERSE 1: Klas 1 ]
Looka here bitch, I got no time for your games
I just wanna hit ya, then I'ma quit ya
Cause Klas 1'll let ya know
That you either get the dick or gets beat to the flo'
I just wants to bone ya, no time to romance
Met ya at the club and now you wanna dance?
But I don't dance cause I step on your toes
Take ya to the room and slap nuts across your nose
So let a nigga cut that ass like a knife
You got a boyfriend? (I got a man) So bitch, I gots a wife
And all I wants is to get in them guts
Call you a slut and put you on the cut
And ehm, I got plans to put yo pussy in check
Bust a nut in your ear and leave your panties soaken wet
Ooh shit, my ass cutie
Wanna see some shit, let me stick my dick in your booty
I'm only out to run game and try to fuck ya
So 86 the other shit, cause bitch, I don't love ya

(Bitch)
(I don't love ya)
(No, no, no, no)

[ VERSE 2: Koo Rod ]
Motherfucker I don't love ya, why ya on my nuts?
Every time a nigga goes out, huhm, you think he's out to fuck
Where ya goin, what's his number?
Bitch chasin me around, now hoe, you makes me wonder
At first the shit was kinda cool
Then yo ass started trippin and actin a damn fool
And bet she crossed me to the square
Dukes, I bend on a hoe in my motherfuckin underwear
Hi, a nigga always deep 4
So you either fuck all or get your ass out the do', ho
It's all about a piece of ass quick
No, I won't eat the pussy but you can suck the dick
And don't think about gettin snaps
Cause all ya gonna get, huh, is these nuts slapped
Dead 'cross your mouth, I'ma bust ya
With this motherfuckin dick cause bitch, I don't love ya

(Bitch)
(I don't love ya)
(No, no, no, no)

[ VERSE 3: Big Boss ]
Bitch, what's up with that bullshit?
If I was eatin pussy you ( ? ) suckin dick
Talkin all that drag about how a nigga ate ya
When you know the truth is that a nigga simply played ya
Tellin all your friends that Boss broke your heart
Bitch, you was tryina run game from the fuckin start
How in the hell you gon' love me
I only met you a week ago, you gold-diggin hoe
I guess she wanted Fendi, Dooney and Gucci
All you had to do is lick the dookie out my booty
So ah, I played games with your mind, though
I told you this, I told you that, I even told you you was fine, hoe
Conversation rules the nation, now that's a fact
Five minutes later ( ? ) had you layin on your back
Ha, givin up the ass
Ooh, I just nutted - Oops, how fast time flies fast
I sho' hate you gotta go, hoe
So here's some change for the METRO
Because

(Bitch)
(I don't love ya)
(No, no, no, no)</pre>
