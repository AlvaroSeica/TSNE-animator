[Billy Cook]
Stop stop, spreading those rumors around
Stop stop, spreading those lies
Stop stop, spreading those rumors around
Stop stop, spreading those lies
(get your mind off, get your mind off me)

[Chorus - 2x]
I don't wanna talk about it, (rumors)
I don't give a damn about it, (life)
What y'all think about it
Making my money, I'm all about it

[Lil' Keke]
What ya doing where ya been, how ya living my man
You done asked me all that, ain't even shook my hand
They say I'm sick, broke don't even got a car
Riding around the city, fronting like I'm a star
Here we go again, tal'n bout guess what they said
Keke laying in the hospital, he damn near dead
Now picture this, me being less of a man
To play the cards I was dealt, then show you my hand
Everytime I turn around, I got a knife in my back
I got these folks in my face, because I'm young and black
I'm making moves, making sure I'm keeping it smooth
Get your own mind your own, everything'll be cool
You gotta catch up with yourself, and try to do something
Figure out the life you living, and quit bumping
Cause me give up on the game, I doubt it
The rumors in the air, but I ain't talking about it cause me

[Chorus - 2x]

[Lil' Keke]
Ain't that the Don, like he's suppose to be rich
But they say he caught a case, now he's a so called snitch
Ain't that funny, how shit change every week
I'm seeing certain people man, I won't even speak
It's getting deep, the fellas getting worse as the women
Friends from last year, are now sour as a lemon
He said she said, that's all you hear
That's why I'm quick to catch ghost, so vanish or disappear
City to city state to state, a different house and gate
A different license plate, the haters hate
Wait, to catch you coming up short
Sticking to the G code, so I hustle with heart
Every year about this time, it goes down
The gossip get thick, and start spreading around
You gotta focus on your paper baby, keep on trucking
And don't sweat the competition, they ain't tal'n bout nothing
But it's a trip, how the word gets out
You got my name in your mouth, you must be talking about
So for the last time, 'fore I leave it alone
You got some real important bidness, won't you mind your own cause me

[Chorus - 2x]

[Lil' Keke]
Another day another dollar, money gotta be made
Early birds get the worm, I'm jumping up getting paid
I'm just a young man, trying to live my life
I gotta make it through the day, so I can pray at night
And what about you playa, how you living these days
You still hating everybody, with your devilish ways
You need to slow down low down, don't get yourself to' down
The route you going, your whole ship bout to go down
For real, take you two steps back
'Fore you slip the wrong way, and catch a counter attack
Jealousy leads to hate, hate leads to death
I'm trying to take another step, you wanna ruin my rep
Cause me, I don't wanna talk about it
And these lies everywhere, don't give a damn about it
And these rumors, they gon' be here forever
But me fall short to that shit, no never me

[Chorus - 2x]

[Billy Cook]
Stop stop, spreading those rumors around
Stop stop, spreading those lies
Stop stop, spreading those rumors around
Stop stop, spreading those lies
Stop stop, spreading these lies</pre>
