(The greatest monuments to fallen men are not made of marble
They're deep in the sea, deep in the jungles, on foreign battlefields
The rifle driven into the ground, the helmet on top...)

To the fallen soldiers
Rest in peace

[ VERSE 1: Penhead ]
Half-dead crackheads slowly turn into zombies
With my third eye all I see is burning bodies
Wicked thoughts of a holocaust shows his face off
In the projects same concept as Adolf
Majority of the law enforcement's German Nazis
Properly furnished with the most advanced technology
Helicopters equipped with night vision, trackin system
Satellites regulate the outer limits
Religious beliefs, kissin a killer's cheek
Showin loyalty to your six deep
Where morals are seen as felonies, guilty by association
Convicted by a corporation of law makers
While the ghetto produce musicians and ball players
With a large percentage incarcerated
Or in the graveyard decayin, prisons overpopulated
So many lies documented in history books
Picture me shook to death, I look to set if off
The law sparks these rebellious thoughts
Cherish the art of war, offer no remorse in combat
This shit's beyond rap

[ CHORUS ]
It's the revolt's brainchild, flow Ching Chow
You perceive your country 12 years from now
And I ain't waitin around for no man
You niggas better get with the program

[ VERSE 2: Penhead ]
Crooked cops plot my exile
Penhead turn blocks to X Files
Starchild pulsates
With the solar systems far away
My brain's a distant planet
Remember when the British landed
On Plymouth Rock
The killin starts and never stops
Slave tribes
Blocks feelin more like a gravesite
The search for peace and harmony
The streets is callin me
Till the Almighty takes His breath from my body
Beware, Satan hold shares in the economy
Invest money wisely
For power and nice things
People might think it's worth your soul
Wealth can turn into a black hole
There's resposibilites with cash flow
If you a asshole broke then you a asshole with dough
Makin money should feel natural
Wish I never had to seel capsules of coke
Like you wish you didn't rat on your folks
Got niggas blastin at you close range
Cocaine destroys in four different ways
Overdoses, being convicted for drug dealin
Gettin killed for squealin
( ? ) raw deal, it's all real
The government calculates a destruction, inconceivable
Livin with these modern day evils
What's illegal, what's illegal?
