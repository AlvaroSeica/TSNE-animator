[Chorus]
Girl, after I fuck you
It's gone change your life boo
You better be careful
You might go psycho [x2]

[Verse 1]
Look at you, why you trippin' if you knew the deal
You know my type girl, you knew that I wouldn't keep it real
I don't be with that lovey dovey shit
Trying to tell you lies just so you could let me hit
I got no time to waste, let me take you away
I could take you to the wildest place
Tongue kiss you while I'm pulling your hair
And make you feel good that we have an affair
Love, you know I don't trip if your happy with him
Just come through and girl I don't care
Just make sure you do understand
This ain't love, I'm still a young man
It's better if you call me just on weekends
Cause now you say I'm so addictive
Here we go again, here we go again

[Chorus]
Girl, After I fuck you
It's gone change your life boo
You better be careful
You might go psycho [x2]

[Verse 2]
Let me tell you bout Monica
That's the only bitch that I'm calling up
Cause she knows how to keep it real G, no key, takes me to extasy
No love, no strings attached
It make me say girl when you coming back
The pussy so bomb and no I'm not sprung
I'm to young to know about love
The game is outragous, you want me, I want your fuck faces
Wake up in the morning with, nothing on
Fuck you once more then call me tomorrow
Don't go crazy if my phones off
Cause that just tells me that's your downfall, that's your downfall
Bitch please don't call, bitch please don't call

[Chorus]
Girl, After I fuck you
It's gone change your life boo
You better be careful
You might go psycho [x2]

[Verse 3]
I'm sorry but I don't miss you
Let me tell you bout a bitch named Krystal
She used to stay by the bay out in fresco
Ass all shaped up, caramel skin tone
You say you are what I need
I'm her ice and she is my cream
She's so loud, I love when she screams
Holds me back like jeezy don't leave
Fucking with me I turned that bitch out
She used to be quiet, you should see now
She can do magic tricks with that mouth
Now shes a pro she has it like wow
Blowin my mind she's a down please
The only one that knows how to find me
Girl don't get it twisted, shit you ain't my girl
Listen

[Chorus]
Girl, after I fuck you
It's gone change your life boo
You better be careful
You might go psycho [x2]

There's something I don't understand about you
I mean you knew the deal from the beginning right
You knew we were just gonna chill
And drink some penicillin
Get a lil buzzed and that's it right

[Chorus]
After I fuck you
It's gone change your life boo
You better be careful
You might go psycho [x2]</pre>
