[Zack de la Rocha]
A mass of hands press on the market window
Ghosts of progress dressed in slow death
Feeding on hunger and glaring through the promise
Upon the food that rots slowly in the aisle
A mass of nameless, at the oasis
That hides the graves beneath the master's hill
Are buried for drinking, the rivers water while
Shackled to the the line at the empty well

[Hook]
This is the new sound, just like the old sound
Just like the noose wound, over the new ground
This is the new sound, just like the old sound
Just like the noose wound, over new ground

Listen to the facist sing
"Take hope here, war is elsewhere
You were chosen, this is God's land
Soon we'll be free of blot and mixture
Seeds planted by our Forefathers' hand"

A mass of promises begin to rupture
Like the pockets Of the new world kings
Like swollen stomachs In Appalachia
Like the priest that fucked you as he whispered holy things
A mass of tears have, transform the stones now
Sharpened on suffering and woven into the slings
Hope lies in the rubble of this rich fortress
Taking today what tomorrow never brings

[Hook]
This is the new sound, just like the old sound
Just like the noose wound, over new ground
This is the new sound, just like the old sound
Just like the noose wound, over the new ground

[*whispers*]
This is the new sound...just like the old sound..
Just like the noose wound...over the new ground..
Ain't the new sound...just like the old sound..
Look at the noose now...over the, over the, over the burning ground!

AIN'T IT FUNNY HOW THE FACTORY DOORS CLOSE
'ROUND THE TIME THAT THE SCHOOL DOORS CLOSE
'ROUND THE TIME THAT THE DOORS OF THE JAIL CELLS
OPEN UP TO GREET YOU...JUST LIKE THE REAPER!!
AIN'T IT FUNNY HOW THE FACTORY DOORS CLOSE
'ROUND THE TIME THAT THE SCHOOL DOORS CLOSE
'ROUND THE TIME THAT A HUNDRED THOUSAND JAIL CELLS
OPEN UP TO GREET YOU... LIKE THE REAPER!!

[guitar riff]
Ah, Oh!
Ah, Oh!
OASIS..
THIS IS NO OASIS!!

[Hook]
This is the new sound, just like the old sound
Just like the noose wound, over the new ground
This is the new sound, just like the old sound
Just like the noose wound, over the new ground

[*whispers*]
Like ashes in the fall..
Like ashes in the fall..
Like ashes in the fall..
Like ashes in the fall..
Like ashes in the fall..
Like ashes in the fall..
Like ashes in the fall..
Like ashes in the fall..
Like ashes in the fall..
Like ashes in the fall..
Like ashes in the fall... (HA! HAA!!)
Like ashes in the fall... (HO! HOO!!)
Like ashes in the fall... (HA! HAA!!)
Like ashes in the fall... (HO! HOO!!)
Like ashes in the fall... (HA! HAA!!)
Like ashes in the fall... (HO! HOO!!)
Like ashes in the fall... (HA! HAA!!)
Like ashes in the fall... (HO! HOO!!)
Like ashes in the fall... (HA! HAA!!)
Like ashes in the fall... (HO! HOO!!)
Like ashes in the fall... (HA! HAA!!)
Like ashes in the fall... (HO! HOO!!)
Like ashes in the fall... (HA! HAA!!)
Like ashes in the fall... (HO! HOO!!)
Like ashes in the fall... (HA! HAA!!)
