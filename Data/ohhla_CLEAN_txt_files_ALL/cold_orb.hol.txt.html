Album:  Theatre of Pain
Song:   Cold Hearted Orb
Typed by: Cno Evil

[Intro: The Moody Blues 'The Day Begins' sample]
Cold hearted orb that rules the night
Removes the colors from our sight
Red is gray and yellow, white
But we decide which is right
And which is an illusion
Pinprick holes in a colorless sky
Let insipid figures of light pass by
The mighty light of ten thousand suns
Challenges infinity and is soon gone
Night time, to some a brief interlude
To others the fear of solitude

[Holocaust]
I fight demons summoned by the Egyptian sorcerer
After a prolong battle, the Nomad enforcer
Seal the demons within a mountain tomb
Losing his magic weapons there, your torture
My war paint you beware, an unnamed ancestor there
Decease, so despair, orchard
A feat tornado killed you and your crew when you all were unaware
Virtually nothing is known as the past, the man known only as the Holocaust
A huge turnout located, beneath Los Angeles
Is where a battle takes place
And all the fans watch, panty on, desert sword sky
Shaolin Monk stealth keeping
Or like John Hancock, a giant Incredible Hulk made of a stone
He's called Brock Bottom, the lights clock and bed rock
The enclypedia of serial killers, crime school, the black hand strikes
The underworld's criminal gang stop
Valentine's day, happy, the untouchables
Cosa Nostra, team money slang
Today's underworld, the deadly trade

[Chorus: Holocaust]
A thermo-optic invisible gun blaster, that's flirting with disaster
I never get captured
A thermo-optic invisible gun blaster, that's flirting with disaster
I never get captured

[Dopestyle]
Fiends fear a king, let me do my thing
MC's on the pill still pregnant from the mic check
From the cat shrek of death, west coast where I wreck
My Chef Boyardee, green with the pesto
Ruler Daquan, him is my friend
MC Green gummy, but, knees never bend
From no man, woman, child, off into the wild
Off into your hood, red riding hood
For what you did to my cousin, the big bad wolf
I come Captain Jack Sparrow or my Captain Hook
Destroy your Peter Pan myths, with my funky lips
Shit's get sticky like peanut butter Jiff
Gold in my furnace, how this, a serious poet
Took a terror time, licked this
Stupendous, vicious, man on a mission
Will Oklahoma bomb ya, but save the children
My man real kinda ill, give girls chill
MC's like you, I put you on my grill
Thrill of the heat, brushing up on your skin
Soft and cover extorior, what's the alterior
Motif for rap flowing, for your fiends and showboating
Fries from Mickey D's, I see you cooking
I still be with the drainer, kids kinda plainer
Forgot to add the salt, my verbal assault
Insult to your injuries, don't remember me?
Draw 31, the man, the myth

[Chorus]</pre>
