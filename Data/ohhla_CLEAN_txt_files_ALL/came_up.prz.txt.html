[Intro: Stic Man]
(Layzie Bone, Stic Man)
All we have is each other, everyday is a struggle
(Young Noble) Life is no guarantee
(Outlaws, Dead Prez, Bone Thug)

Everyday is a struggle, all we have is each other (Come on)

[Verse 1: Young Noble]
One time, one time, one cop with a K-9
Cock and I spray mine, drop and lay one
Down to the the ground, we callin' C-Town
Ask and harass, and its all of the time
Bein' a young thug, we always real dumb
The money would still come, but wait 'till the bills come
Back to square one, shottin' the fair one, taught to fair none
The right to bare arms
Look at my eyes; You better feel the pain, you better learn the game
I had my turn of fame
Fuck that, just give me money instead
And when the hungry is fed, and when it's all said and done
Nigga we' all for one, homie it's all or none
All I really need is a call or come
Remain a Outlaw 'till its said and done
remain a Outlaw 'til I'm dead and gone

[Chorus: Stic Man, Layzie Bone &amp; Young Noble]
It ain't nothin' if it ain't about green (We came up)
Hopes if it ain't about me (We came up)
It's to all my hopes and my dreams (We came up)
It's to all them niggas up in the bay (we come up)
All my niggas that's from the 'hood (We came up)
Soldiers on mind and made good (We came up)
Money on the wood make it really all good (We came up)
You will get it if you could, yep (We came up)

[Verse 2: Stic Man]
Like a brick through the window everybody on the block come quick
Gets some fo' your kinfolk
Discount sale goin' down for once, aw you can count with me nigga pop the trunk
We in sock, shoes, shit we could use
Laptops still in the box for the cruise
It's not a riot, fool, it's a rebellion
Malcom said it's righteous to rob for food
clothes and shelter
By enemies it's neccessary, smash and grab
Takin' everthang you can carry, nigga
Revolutionary, nigga
Can't be no scary, nigga
Runnin' down the alley with a handfull of jewerly
Feelin' like Huey, nigga
Nothin' they can do to me, nigga
Fuck poverty, nigga

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Layzie Bone]
Small thang to a giant when a nigga wanna talk about his toys with his boys well
The cost ain't shit to a boss
Wanna break a nigga off, set it off when a nigga wanna floss
Down here on the '99 it feel like a war zone
It's where you can find mine, when I bring the war on
Struggle the bubble when nigga hustle to double up
Fuck with my money and nigga you in trouble, what?
Everybody tryin' to get in where the fit in
Talkin' ain't nothin' if it ain't about dividends
Standin' a the corner tryin'a get me a Benz, four-five cocked
My only friend
And again I don't trust ya'll anyway, me?
Lil' Layzie I been gettin' plenty pay
Spray the semi 'till its empty, on any givin' day
Nigga, heard what I said, nigga any givin' day
Born to take charge; We criminals at large
Niggas smell pussy and I'm pullin' your whole cards
Brother on lock and he's runnin' the whole yard
St. Clair niggas came up with the bogart
Take it if I want it, let a nigga get up on it
Gotta give it to 'em quick; Hit 'em up, no warnin'
Ya'll niggas wanna get involved, search ya' just like ya' want it, want it

[Chorus]</pre>
