[ VERSE 1: Lord Finesse ]
I'm real like the Son Of Sam while other are soft like Richie Gun-In-Hand
Their styles is outdated like the _Running Man_
A tough vet, I'm the roughneck that drops logic
The hefty solid, prophet from the projects
The spiritual, the lyrical, individual
(No doubt, kid) Yeah, the Lord works miracles
I hustle for mine like those pumpin cracks
I got thumpin raps that'll have you niggas doin jumpin jacks
I come with the fat songs, put me on any platform
Watch me get my muthafuckin rap on
A top cat that rocks rap
&gt;From the part of Boogie Down Bronx where the cabs don't stop at
The Asiatic rap fanatic that don't have it
My style's tighter than a virgin locked in traffic
You get ripped like a cardboard
Because you watch gangsta flicks, you write rhymes, don't mean you're hardcore
I'm so devine when I flow and rhyme
I blow your mind when I go for mine
(Come on) Y'all niggas know the time
I kick hip-hop in its true form
Big up to Fat Joe, congratulations on the newborn

[ VERSE 2: Marquee ]
Like the Coyote I gets Wile E.
And freaks it with the stylee
My shit is type ???, so my life be like irie
I be the MC that's above and beyond
Them all, stand out like Leon, tackle comp like Deion
Be on some hip-hop shit, cause the music like hypnotic
I can't stop it, oh Lord, so I just drops it
Till the slayings leave abrasions, hot like cajun
Trails be blazin behind this chinky-eyed non-Asian
Female bringin it to ya like e-mail
With advanced techniques off these New York streets
So hardrocks licks a smooth exotic sister
Strong as a bull, while you be slackin like a 76er
Yeah, this is my world, the slang sign
And out no doubt, Marquee, I do my thing

[ VERSE 3: Diamond D ]
Now, you say Grenada, and I say Grenada
Big up to Greeny Greeen, I meet your black ass later
But wait a, minute, cause I'm in it to win it
With the freestyle flow I steal the show like John Benett
But then it, really wouldn't matter to a nigga
You figure you have to sneak up cause I'm bigger
Yo jigga, take down the beat just a little
Far from brittle, chew a nigga like a skittle
But it'll, be a cold day in the Caribean
At the Meridian, I swim through girls like an amphibian
I'm witty and, versed with the lyrical blessin
Never fessin, and keep the chickens second-guessin
Known for stressin engineers in my session
I flake in one take, and slide like Wesson
So learn a lesson, I make the episode brief
You seek relief as you pick up your teeth

[ VERSE 4: A.G. ]
Try to spark this, you'll get torn, cause you never win
I'm through, I'll take you, through hell again
It's the Goodfellas, first aid kit The Medicine
Stay legit cause we're veterans
Proceed what I don't achieve
Leave up to my seed, teach him that he gotta bleed
Don't fall victim to greed
That you give is what you're blessed with
Find it, put it to use, have faith and don't stress shit
Meanwhile I hit the ganja, now watch it kiss my lips
Bless it, then pass it, like Magic's top 10 assists
It's the cheeba-cheeba, another neighborhood news feature
Who can see the, Giant? Not a known creature
Or being alive that can see me on this rap vibe
High off of hip-hop, can't die, I got cat lives
Abuse this, get smuddered is how you'll be discovered
Give me 20 years in here with no dough, I still love it
It's in my heart, when I bled, it was red
Won't stop till I drop dead, or catch some led to my head
Some search for bread, loot, cheese, or whatever
But instead I stay true, smoke trees and get clever
Fall never, Show and A is who we be
See why D.I.T.C. will reign forever
