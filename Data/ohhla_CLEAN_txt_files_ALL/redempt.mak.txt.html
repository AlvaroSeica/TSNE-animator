[Intro: Makeba Mooncycle]
Until it's right..
Dear God, you gave me the word
I think it's too heavy, the truth is always too heavy
Can they handle it? Shall I proceed?
I will, I will

[Chorus 2X: Makeba Mooncycle w/ Lion Heart adlibs]
What you gonna do? Redemption soon
How you gonna handle it? How you gonna handle it?

[Makeba Mooncycle]
What you gonna do? How you gonna survive
When you gonna ride, when you gonna die
Continue to strive, just to stay alive
I'm ready for some freedom, and a little bit of justice
In a system that's built on greed, built on us
Take it from the poor, give it to the rich
Making a switch, exposing new tricks
Are you ready to make moves? Maintain and lose
There's no proceeding, when there's a stand still
And there's no progress without a person's will
Ya'll said it was gonna happen, some said it wasn't so
Read revelations, the rest you should know
Heed my directions, call him by his name
Praise the almighty, it's time for no games
I hope it stays in a bowl, and not down the drain
With a flick of my pen, my thoughts remain sane

[Chorus 2X w/ Lion Heart adlibs]

[Makeba Mooncycle]
Just a few more bars, a few more scars
A few more tears, a few more people that don't care
Raising funds, to pull along and condemn
Holy ones destroying Jerusalem to Bethlehem
Everyone's chosing, most of us dozing
Everyone gets caught in a world filled with pleasure
But how many of us, appreciate a treasure
I get tired of talking, hearing my sex speak
Nobody's listening, everyone's on the creep
Single I remain, because I don't seek
I'm too strong, some men are too weak
I wanna relax, in a garden off an island joint
I wanna walk with my fam without being on point
Nothing's entertainable if your unstoppable
Nothing's worth nothing, everything is possible
Jesus the son of God, your poor righteous teacher
So how in the hell could Satan ever defeat you?

[Chorus to fade w/ Lion Heart adlibs]</pre>
