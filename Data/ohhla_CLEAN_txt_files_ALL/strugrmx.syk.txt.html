[2Pac talking]
The struggle continues
The struggle continues
The struggle continues

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Now I was born as a rebel making trouble for the Devil
Take this gangbang shit, to a whole another level
Can you feel me now?
Armies in every city, definition of power
Players, are you with me?
See the war is the prophecy, survival is the strategy
Rest in peace
To my comrades that's deceased
Organize the streets in time
You'll have these devils petrified of a nigga in his right mind
They tell us that we hopeless and hell bound
It's for the brothers in penitentiaries jailed down
I got you in my heart until the day I die
Think of the damage we could do, if we wasn't high
Can you picture me loc?
It's a thug's wrath
Political contracts and blood baths
For Mutulu Shakur up in the Rikers
Though they got you
I'll never let them stop me the struggle continues

[Verse 2: Hussein Fatal]
I gotta get out of town see I done shot another dick
Nigga be rolling trip's to keep his mind off sticks
They check our parole they supervise my whole size
Money wires surprise drug dealer's on the rise
These car jack's is federal you soft and shred able
Dictionary rapper's you come at me all edible
I lit past your crew, like you know what I'm about (Ha ha ha)
Guinness style cause Fatal done hit up another house
These prop's and pretty niggas getting played like pumps
Fucking up these fag front's, fronting on blunts
Blast these bitch niggas bullshitting on a body
Kill nigga Brown it and me and you can ask Bobby
Slick, shoot her and loot her
Kill her smoke the Buddha
Man this dirty money can't get a little cuter
Money and hoes, money and hoes
Rest in peace Al. Storm murder case just closed

[Verse 3: FlipSide]
All I'm trying to do is make a penny
But crooked cop's beating down my door like I beat down Resno Dinny
They in position with they shot guns
But if they kick in my door like I know they catch the hot one
They kicked it in
So Flip got pissed
Now I'm on the run living life as a fugitive
The cop's was deep
They made a clean sweep
I tried to break but caught one in the ass cheek

[Verse 4r: Big Syke]
A drug smuggler from the underworld
Thugging Desperado
Visual loco motion from my Teflon hollow's
Transgression racketeer probation violator
Buster tester, no fear for a Ingle Watts slayer
My future's unknown hoochies on the phone calling me
Parking down the street from my house trying to follow me
Boundaries restricted for a thug unconstitutional
Balling out of control from L.A. to Puerto Rico

[Verse 5: FlipSide]
I'm bleeding bad
And damn I need a doctor
But I can't do shit until I shake this helicopter
A gang banger dope slanger full of anger
I killed a cop now they want me on a coat hanger

[Verse 6: Big Syke]
We smoke Dope and soak Weed and greed ain't uncommon though
Dog I'm in need indeed ain't no option though
Cookies and chip's I got a street education
My homies stressing out cause his babies mama's basing
What am I chasing a relationship with god or a female?
Secrets don't tell, I just posted bail
Fuck Jail and the C.O. from my niggas in the Pen'
Treated like a dog for his sin fuck a friend
Let my 64 Benz blockade as I fade back streets
L.A., Eastside Compton, Long Beach
Murderous killer's lunatic kamikazes
We drop bodies and throw parties the struggle continues</pre>
