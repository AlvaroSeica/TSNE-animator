[Ja Rule]
yea, yo - yo - yo - YO! - (yo) - Holla (Holla)
The Last Temptation, we comin' through now niggaz
s'the problem?, (the problem?) s'the problem?, (the problem?)
Always has been, hahaha, yo partna (yo partna)
Turn me up this bitch up in my mothafuckin' headphones and shit
C'mon, well let these niggaz know, (niggaz know)
Let it known...muh'afuckas y'all want war wit' the GOD
C'mon y'all know better, I put holes in ya leather
Reknit your sweater, and I bet the flows wetter
Then ocean front property - better come at me properly
Niggaz better off poppin' me - but I believe
Y'all scared to clap them hammers
In the fact I'm unpredictable, gives me the advantage
What the fuck, am I'm speaking spanish niggaz
What I got ta tell y'all in detail how we murder niggaz
Handle ya buisness, Tha Inc. is religious
Murder's the sacrifice, throwing M's niggaz
That means Murda fa' life, and I'll die for that red and black
That house wit' tha chedda stack, wit' smiles in my kids face
What could replace this, this lil' nigga here 
The coming to grips with death, to taste it
My airs thick and filled with hatred
Surprise of that look in my eyes, but don't be
I'm just following the foots of the Lord, then thank me
If I go crazily insane, I'ma blame it on the world
Look what I became, 'cause they ain't give me all the
fame and the money mayne, made me an I-con
So the world can catch a nigga with his lights on
That's the pros and con, ya never quite free
So just gimme a lil' room so I can breathe
And my pain goin' be the death of me
But to be loved is my destiny, my black people...
Yea (yea) - we out (we out) Holla (Holla - Holla - Holla)</pre>
