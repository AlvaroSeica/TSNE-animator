...East Hills line
First stop Green Square, Mascot, Domestic Terminal, International Airport
...Sydenham, Marickville, Hurlstone Park, Canterbury, Campsie
and then all stations to Bankstown
Then Yagoona, Birrong, then all stations to Lidcombe

[Verse 1: Bzerkatron]
You smile to yourself as you ride past the panel beaters
New pieces last night, early morning on the bike
Eight hours in the shop most days of the week
Maintaining food on your plate and your place in the street
Keep one eye on the clock and so you're ready to bail
Learnt long ago never to rely on CityRail
When you ride the Sydney system, you're up there with the best
They're all laughing out loud at that ridiculous nest
Past the park with the Tai Chi stretch and Yoga heads
And the people with the bottles and the benches for beds
Hell for leather down Crown, hold your breath at the lights
Keep monoxide from your lungs and keep it fresh for the mic
Band practice tonight to try and keep the set tight
But before then, spend time with the love of your life
Got priorities right, maintaining love with respect
There's a thousand roads to travel but you know your direction

[Chorus: All]
Same line, same day, all on the same track
We cross paths but barely interact
You got no time to chit chat, you've got a schedule to keep
Shooting straight across the city and you're dodging the sheep
It's the same line, same day, all on the same track
We cross paths but barely interact
One more 24 hour stretch from daylight to dusk and dusk down to desk

[Verse 2: Urthboy]
Waiting for the 4:28 
Ragged old suit briefcase looks much older than his age
Like to catch the bus home 
Not concerned by the traffic and the lights and the ticket price hikes
Kinda like the bus, no one talks that much 
Keep the conversation hush, the city's pretty at dusk
And most places are expressionless, pressing the bell 
While peak hour reeks perfume that you just can't sell 
From Central up to King Street, window washers hussle all the cars 
The bus driver just looks and laughs
I pass fools in parks and pass people by
He's content, never meeting with no reason why
You have a cold yet? Comfortable, welcome at home 
a little bachelor pad, a gold fish and a phone
Where he'll go back to sleep dream and wake up at eight
Get prepared, catch the bus back to work again... it's like

[Chorus + (Ozi)]
Same line, same day, all on the same track
We cross paths but barely interact
One more 24 hour stretch from daylight to dusk and dusk down to desk
Same line, same day, all on the same track
We cross paths but barely interact
(It's all I ask of this complex town 
Share a tale or two and watch the sun go down)

[Verse 3: Ozi Batla]
The sun set so fast I didn't see it happen
Like I look back on days just to see the patterns
See the way the last rays of the day are scattered 
in such a different way to when I first sat here
(Another beer?) You know the more some things change 
the more some things are bound to stay the same
It's a shame about those units across the street though
We used to get that much more light in the arvo
Still it's a good place to sit for a while
Even if these days I don't quite fit the style
It's the people I come here for though, not the decor
And they don't seem to think of me as too much of an old bore
I used to live just round the corner
But then the rent got too dear so I moved from here
Still it's not so far, and just to come for a beer
I'm not a local but I'm still a local here

[Chorus + (Ozi)]
Same line, same day, all on the same track
We cross paths but barely interact
You got no time to chit chat, you've got a schedule to keep
Shooting straight across the city and your're dodging the sheep
Same line, same day, all on the same track
We cross paths but barely interact
(It's all I ask of this complex town 
Share a tale or two and watch the sun go down)
