Why did you wake up in the life, in this world we livin
Love ain't worth a dime, so then you nothin to give him
The baby has no father, he ran out on the mother
So raise him as cannibal to be like Jeffrey Dahmer
You life is really worthless, you live and then you die
You go to die, and bodies rot and then your wonder why
And then you live in doubt, til you live or live without
The facts you know, you can't afford to feed another mouth
Your head is steady spinnin, the Devil's steady grinnin
While you was steady sinnin from the very first beginnin
Is it a boy or a girl, I think I should referral
You should terminate it, because it's a lousy world
You life on the line, you're out ya fuckin mind
You gotta to your tape, cuz you're runnin outta time
It's just another embryo, attached to an umbilical
You can let that baby grow, but I'd kill it though, kill the fetus

The bodies premature, the mother is a whore
Contemplatin suicide so what you waitin for
I think I heard a splinter, but that's a normal state
Gem a hang over ya asshole until your water brake
You better use some caution, yea they used up an abortion
Death the only way to solve a suicide solution
So here's my contribution, my suicide solution
You play the game of death, but then you can't win for losin
You want it and you got this, on shit you killed the fetus
Live is just a waste, so then you outta just delete this
Problem to society, society's a problem
My suicide solution is a 38 revolver
I'm your problem solver, your life is full of horror
Some are born to die and some are die tomorrow
Vagina tissue's dorm, your pussy's kinda worn
I flipped out on a warn, if you haven't none to born
Your inner one perspective, there is one conceseptent
Your M.P.D. is positive, so you can let that baby live
It's just another embryo, attached to an umbilical
You can let that baby grow, but I'd kill it though, kill the fetus

The planet's really fucked, so know ya kinda stuck
You should of thought about it, before you bust a nut
It is a lousy world, I live a lousy life
I think I outta stab ya, wit the sunkin, wit the knife
Or push you down a flight of steps, until you fall and break ya neck
Did a little damage, can you manage on this carriage
Life is not a choice, death is the alternative
Or shit you let it grow up in this fucked up world that we live in
These are the consequences, add one more to the State Census
Born to die in poverty, so tell me what's the census
It's just another embryo, attached to an umbilical
You can let that baby grow, but I'd kill it though, kill the fetus
