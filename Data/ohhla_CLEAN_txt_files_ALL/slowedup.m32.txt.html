[Mr. 3-2]
Looking real nice and candy, flossing the Ave.
83's boss hogging, and doing em bad
No clacking baby, I ain't even trying to hear it
Trunk bout to rattle off, better not go near it
Got baby posted up, in the passenger seat
All sweet and petite, in the fo' do' fleet
Concrete breaking up, while I'm rolling down
Boys giving me the finger, I'm holding now
Smoke coming out the roof, on MLK
Bout to hit the 6-10, on a beautiful day
Tre Deuce Fatt Domino, is the man
Counting up these stacks, wrapped in rubber bands
My hustle never go dead, or play out
I get it, that's what I be talking bout
Down South, we got our music chopped and screwed
R.I.P. Robert Davis, dedicated to you

[Hook - 2x]
Slowed up, steady mashing down the road
Po'd up, blueberry got me thoed
Stay down, represent the dirty coast
What it is, breaking bread with my folks

[Mr. 3-2]
Hold it down from the winter, all the way to the fall
Summertime, old schools gotta creep and crawl
Lil' mamas getting hot, and they showing they skin
Monkey in that g-string, and it won't stay in
On the seawall flossing, and it's Kappa time
Gotta snatch me something, hit it from behind
These ladies want a guy, that's gon' handle up
I'ma do it for the job, cause I love to cut
Blowing cold AC, with the windows tinted
I'm paid for baby, this here ain't rented
It costs to be the boss, where the paper at
I grind real hard, no looking back
Fat mack with the broads, all calling my name
Conversation is a fool, fill they head with game
Classic thangs pulling up, at the club valet
I'm a show case baby, and I ain't gon' pay

[Hook - 2x]

[Mr. 3-2]
Pull up, when I'm mashing on the pedal with speed
Lane to lane swanging, a down South G
Paper, power and politics
Run these streets, I wonder how much I can get
In my life, I'm living like it's my last day
Ain't no telling, when a player going away
Hiram-Clarke to the West, all the way to the Valley
Got sticky-icky buds, transported from Cali
Put it up with the crystals, dumped in that murder
It's so lovely, got me pacing in lil' circles
Stay G, keeping my eyes on the prize
Wide body ride, can't be denied
Breaking off, everything up in the lot
Jackers better not try, or I'm busting shots
Stay ready, you get what you asking fo'
Plastic screen lit up, fall down to the flo'

[Hook - 2x]</pre>
