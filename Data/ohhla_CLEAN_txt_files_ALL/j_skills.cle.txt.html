Cale the Lyricist

[Verse 1]
A prominent communicator, clever rhyme creator
Arranging more connections than phone operators
I represent myself, not here to be a savior
Cale's put in years of labor without asking any favors
Ain't no center of attention, spotlight competer
Who's ego always needs to be fed like parking meters
Looking for compliments, to find confidence
Than acting like a know it all, using faulty omniscience
I'll kick an acapella, become a fortune teller
So you start to listen closer with the more I got to tell ya
Rhyming at the max, where I play with people's fate
Prone to blow you all away like candles on a birthday cake
I always set it off like happy new year fireworks
Explosions are heard across the entire earth
And in a sec, when I'm done with this last metaphor
It'll be time to stop period like menopause

[Chorus]
(Just Skills) when I grip this microphone and spit
(It's Just Skills) when I make you throw yours hands up in a fit
(What) Nothing but skills ( Right here ) Just Skills
Nothing but skills, yo this is all Just Skills

 [Verse 2]
I'm gonna start to flow, release and let it go
With no direction or particular destinal
The highly credible, poetical, professional
About to let you know I always have a point like decimals
Skepticals get sent to medical correctional
Shocked with electric volts and treated unethical
My unforgettable, aesthetical, spectacles
They couldn't see with spectacles or even hear through decibals
Ingesting whole microphones, to me their edible
I'm a hungry MC that intends on getting full
The tip of my tongue divides into tentacles
Wrapping you up with a clutch that's unpreventable
My diet's not full of fatty high cholesterol ( No )
Hard digestables that sit in large intestinals
Mixing chemicals like scientific academical
Intellectuals working on a new inventible **

[Chorus]
(Just Skills) when I grip this microphone and spit
(It's Just Skills) when I make you throw yours hands up in a fit
(What) Nothing but skills ( Right here ) Just Skills
Nothing but skills, yo this is all Just Skills

[Verse 3]
I'm sicker, than any disease human beings
Are eligible to receive whenever we breathe
Guaranteed to make you freeze, with verbal expertise
That'll blow you away like mucus when you sneeze
Gonna have to think about what you just heard
A subliminal metaphor only a few could observe
Always a step ahead, moving continuous
Probably faster than your brain to body response stimulus
Feel the breeze from these lyrics as they pass ya
Be prepared to catch the next rhyme coming after
Natural disaster on a path right at' cha
About to spill my guts like oil tankers in Alaska
I'm an active volcano, burning islands to ash
Got villagers running fast, trying to escape in rafts
Watching their backs, attempting to paddle off
From a flow that gets so rough, it could drown David Hasselhoff
Massive tidal waves with lyrical sprays
Releasing funk like skunks afraid of becoming prey
My thought velocity, will make you stop and hold still
Like animals just before they're squashed into road kill

[Chorus]
(Just Skills) when I grip this microphone and spit
(It's Just Skills) when I make you throw yours hands up in a fit
(What) Nothing but skills ( Right here ) Just Skills
Nothing but skills, yo this is all Just Skills
