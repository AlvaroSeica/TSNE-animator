[The Grouch]
Some-sometimes I just try to relax
Kick back, put my feet up on the table
and be able to enjoy life
Often times I can't
be caught up in so much activity
don't got time to view the landscape
Fools is always hittin me up to do music
but I just wanna lay down
These females is either trippin or never around
and my sound is never quite the way I want it
But somehow, some way or another
I manage to find fun in this life I lead
So I travel on with my brothers sure of that
If you don't feel it, so be it -- I still exist
And in my world, I'm the King of this shit
Self-proclaimed
