It's on you girl, it's all on you, girl!
It's on you girl, it's all on you!

Look girl, you know that I wanna hit that
You only with it cause you know I kick a sick rap
Your man wanna combat, but I ain't on that
He just mad that AMB got the contract
Funny how so many bitches wanna come by
When back then it was, "Aww, he's just some guy"
Now that my paper's straight, they wanna act right
Flossin' them titties and steady workin' the backside
Whisper in my ear sayin' they can treat a thug right
Well, that ain't me, bitch. I live scrub life
Cause that's the only way I escape
Watchin' my old school Monday night Nitro tapes
With my homeboys - And they' tap that ass
Most times they do, it's just a part of the path
From the crowd to the stage, from the stage to the head
Through the back, to the crew, to the bus, to the bed
If you had it your way it wouldn't end with a thanks
It'd be bus to the bed then straight to the bank
Fuck that
All you want is some superstar sex
To try to get you some of them superstar checks
Keep callin' me superstar and this what you get
Mister Otis chokin' the shit outta that pretty little neck (just fuckin' die!)
And don't think for a second that you're wifey
You get a dick and that's it and then I'm like, "Peace!"

[Chorus]
It's like this; you ain't right you trife bitch, you sick
Always out for my chips and dip
You think them lips will get shit from me?
Nothin' but a nut and a fuck and that's free
You think them lips will get shit from me?
Nothin' but a nut and a fuck and that's free

[Hook]
It's on you girl, it's all on you, girl!
It's on you girl, it's all on you!

[Bonez Dubb]
Oh no, I seen her comin' from a long ways
She got a limp and her walkin' don't look okay
Steady shakin' and bakin' takin' them baby steps
More like a shuffle or hustle, but with a broke neck
Bitch, I ain't got no twenty for that ass
Cause you know crackheads don't pay nobody back
I can drop you off at my homie's crib
and they'd love to give that dirty little neden a dip, shit
I ain't hatin' I'm just sayin' that you playin
all that namin' on my game, that shit's gotta go
And I'm creepin' and you sleepin' on them meetin' to decide
When the fuck we gonna roll on this basehead hoe
One thing I gotta do before you say somethin' else
Is try to get this girl some professional help
I'm gonna get someone to take you out
To try to get some food instead of dick in your mouth
Cause it's like that
I ain't down and you ain't shit
Back up off the dip, you dumb bitch
I chop necks and sirens
By all means, stay off the street and start smokin' the green
I see you screamin' at the camera up on T.V
Steady makin' your rounds up on the news team
Cause they give up a hoe that's so dead and sick
But she'll never catch a drift of my chips and dip!

[Chorus]
It's like this; you ain't right you trife bitch, you sick
Always out for my chips and dip
You think them lips will get shit from me?
Nothin' but a nut and a fuck and that's free
You think them lips will get shit from me?
Nothin' but a nut and a fuck and that's free

[Hook]
It's on you girl, it's all on you, girl!
It's on you girl, it's all on you!

[Otis]
And that's right! Scrub life, bitch! Sweat from my biggity balls!</pre>
