[Intro]
Yeah! Talk to me man! 
Word up man! Park that thing over there man
Yeah all that inside is marble nigga
Take me over there get me three white owls nigga
Word up man! Yeah! Do this shit man!
Let's go nigga!

[Verse One]
Park the red baron beamer in the back of the cleaners
'Laxin with the army gun team I met at Yeena's
And my blow like Floyd hands
The chain I wear is skinny baby but the weight eighty grand
Jumpin out of solid shit rugby marathon 
Use to rob Paragon smoke with Agallah
Flow was designed for the Ghost but I don't want it
If it's not bitin the head off, come see me slap a don
Great take me and that connect with the grimeys
Back when me and Flex kidnapped the nineties
I was king call me Luther LeBron
Make a dream team appear, courtside seats and them karmas
Known for my get down and fly wear it's usually my eye wear
That make me buy up everything bong
I'm a old fila king with wings on street cog nike suit
Sharp paid gold face Milan

[Chorus]
We gettin bread in the buildin
Niggas gettin money quick to spread in the buildin gettin lead in the buildin
Bosses don't bite they write checks
I want the nigga head in the buildin get fed in the wilderness
We gettin bread in the buildin
Niggas gettin money quick to spread in the buildin gettin lead in the buildin
Bosses don't bite they write checks
I want the nigga head in the buildin get fed in the wilderness

[Verse Two]
Aiyyo four limb goose down to the tim's 
The gem's is coke boy money layin the seven hundred benz
Blowin cheba dumpin ashes
The class of last year, that'll throw ya head through the glass
Forty five all diamonds in it, grimeys get it
Chinese killers a jump out and give it
I will post in the New York Post, blueberry ghost
Use steady motion when I'm aimin my pitch 
We young niggas who die hard, fly ride hard
Soft top that means to push your head off
I be famous but my bodyguard's spanglish
It's all miscellaneous, ain't nobody tellin it ain't a issue
Thick gifts cakes with bombs in it
Coolin in the velbet room pullin mad pussy I'm gone with it
Yeah boo the texture is cashmere 
I beat ya man up, drop five hundred and blow and smash gears

[Chorus]
We gettin bread in the buildin
Niggas gettin money quick to spread in the buildin gettin lead in the buildin
Bosses don't bite they write checks
I want the nigga head in the buildin get fed in the wilderness
We gettin bread in the buildin
Niggas gettin money quick to spread in the buildin gettin lead in the buildin
Bosses don't bite they write checks
I want the nigga head in the buildin get fed in the wilderness
