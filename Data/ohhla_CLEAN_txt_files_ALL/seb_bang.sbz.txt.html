[Intro: Shabazz the Disciple]
Haha, yeah, Ringz &amp; Partnerz
It's the block, baby

[Shabazz the Disciple]
Yah, straight out the project with the blood on the hook
Ain't no love inside the court room, the judge throw the book
Coke blizzard, flood the heroin, drugs that'll cook
Ski mask, black gloves, all my thugs and my crooks
Hah, I wrote my thug muthafuckas a book
They ain't dream in '94 had the industry shook
You get your queen took, nigga, here come the rook
Ya'll niggas tuck ya chains, here come the hook

[Chorus 2X: Shabazz the Disciple]
Hah, we can get it on, bang, we can get it on
I'm from the get it on, bang, we can get it on
We can get it on, bang, we can ge it on
Sebili-bili-bong, bang, we can get it on

[Shabazz the Disciple]
Fool them a try tough, pon dem not working real life
Them false see them, pistol whip 'em
Then we strip 'em for them jewels then body them
Wicked man, ah, wicked man, in the party shotty them
Put the clip inside me, light and cock me
Back and body them, when I fling machine
You can't outrun, rubbergrip with beam
I make the crip walk when I split ya spleen
Them fool not done? Him get hit again
Don't underestimate the evil my men do
Giving all ya'll niggas head dots like the Hindu
Man, I friend you, to hell is where I send you
Run through with a hundred goons and burn down the venue
Me say fe fi fo fum, hear the sound as I pound on my shoulder drum
Send a spirit to the sky, and a solar numb
I spit the M-16's, put a hole in 'em
Me say fe fi fo fum, hear the sound as I pound on my shoulder drum
Send a spirit to the sky, and a solar numb
I spit the M-16's, put a hole in 'em

[Chorus 2X]

[Shabazz the Disciple]
For all my ladies put the hands in the air, like
Do your thing, cop the thing, if it feels like
To all my niggas get that money in the wheels like
Start a label, rush the game, get your gears right
A butter pecan, unscoopable, when she missing out
You learn the hard way what the Koopa do
Niggas is eating my food, counting my magic game
It's time for dynasty, get blown out, with my extension
Look at Tonto, twist the girlie body like fonto
Nigga saddle up, giddie up on the bronco
Pronto, baby, give it to me how you want to
Back to the front, ya'll know it hard slow

[Chorus 2X]

[Shabazz the Disciple]
Step up the plate, here's the pitch, it's a knuckleball
Smack it to the stands, on you haters, man, fuck you all
I rush the game with my thieves, yeah, we stuck you all
Number one with a bullet bout to fuck you all</pre>
