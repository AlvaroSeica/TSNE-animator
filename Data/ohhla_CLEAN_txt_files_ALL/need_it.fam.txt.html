[Intro: Kool Keith]
Say bye..
Why try?..
Playborne Family

[Kool Keith]
I show kids the top man
On top of the red fire truck with money green pro kits
Special arrangements, with New York City effects
My sprinkles cover the bucket seats, heads bop more
Women rotate they faces, females watch me
Guys know better - it's too hot
Freeze the freestyle in the streets
Your hype man got the registrations
Girls front drivin' your whips
Your Denali truck is on the lease
You don't want me to cancel your deal
Anybody you sign, I pee on your release
Nobody's out there, beats
Your style won't go far, I'll give you twenty weeks
Five years plus, the best sucka - nothin' will increase
Look what happened to Braxton
With all that corny ass guest star action
Tight fit, straight leg, tell the industry I'm maxin'
Ruben want the autograph, I gave it to Randy Jackson

[Chorus: Kool Keith]
I seen it like that
We leanin' like that
We need it like that
We feed it like that
You come to the table
We greet it like that
(So what chu' sayin'?, what chu' sayin?)

[Marc Live]
Yo, yo, you talkin' crazy, oh you can't bounce South
Stop speakin' yo you're not eatin'
Streets ain't checkin', chicks ain't dancin'
Clubs ain't tippin'
Your fam - kick 'em outta the kitchen (Oh!)
No breeze or chicken, stop, drop, my peoples is lickin'
Murkin' and hurtin', yo we workin' hard (workin' hard)
Block 50, long scar, gold heart, hustle long, get gone
Yo my block tells me - kid you're wrong
Nobody gets money, it's funny looks from millions of crooks
Captain Hook, don't try me
I've been underneath the pavement, I made men
Before Benzino and them
It's all good though... we gonna do it again
We tell two friends
We grip a chick, it's not a pay scale
You can hit the mall or sell tail

[Chorus: Kool Keith]
I seen it like that
We leanin' like that
We need it like that
We feed it like that
You come to the table
We greet it like that
(So what chu' sayin'?, what chu' sayin?)

[Jacky Jasper]
I'll keep it pimpin', get layed out trippin'
Jewels drippin', dude you're slippin'
Jacky Jasper, Clayborne pimpin'
Chicks out flippin', Keith hittin', spittin'
No rhymes written on spinners, dippin'
Ki's I'm shippin', profit and admittin'
Murray's kickin', leave the chicks pickin'
Her lips lickin', I'm stickin' not trickin'
In a Lincoln, snowman pushin'
One spittin', not me but the kitten
Sip it, not rip and start pimpin'
Nuttin' givin' on BET, "f" higher livin'
VH1 I'm Driven
I'll save the children, put you in a coffin'
Your broke, I scorn, pay trap a broad
You warn Sean Anthony Clayborne

[Chorus: Kool Keith] - 2X
I seen it like that
We leanin' like that
We need it like that
We feed it like that
You come to the table
We greet it like that
(So what chu' sayin'?, what chu' sayin?)</pre>
