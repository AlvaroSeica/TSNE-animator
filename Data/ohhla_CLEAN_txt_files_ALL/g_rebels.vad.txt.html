[Phi-Life]
I'm vexed and perplexed like Malcolm X
On stage with chains around their necks
From the thread of the governments evil flex
I'm taking steps against the kind of lies they try to bring me
As a ? soldier with ?
Daily papers they're just propaganda scriptures from the government
It's not the daily news, it's the daily satanical supplement
Cause they don't deal with holy testaments just war and pestilence
Can I get a witness I don't need one in fact there's too much evidence
Spying on the people lying evil little devils
They're recruiting demon soldiers while they execute our rebels
CCTV cameras set up on no man's borders
They're not for law and order, they're Lucifer's camcorders
Politicians they're not concord borders they're using flying saucers
Decide to take to the sky or travel underwater
Chameleon type reptilians moving they're tongues like geckos
And they're trying to turn our ghettos into oversized death rows
You want heroin there's tons of that, guns and crack
But who's got the funds and cash the same people who supply guns to Iraq
They're pimping the public like rent boys prostitutes and hookers
Bringing strain to the brain as you remain in this giant pressure cooker
Behind your back trying to took your promise the world and overlook us
Spreading the evil love of Beelzebub, these human race butchers
Mankind destroyers, life I'm chasing those freemasons
Chasing 'em back to the place of birth to reverse all of their creations
Scientists give us fabrication of mathematical equations
But the square root of my truth will cause the devil devastation

[Cypher]
Well listen I'm more than vexed
I live in a time where I can't afford to flex
The police are stopping and searching just like some illegal border checks
You better beware we're living inside of lucifers era
My cypher's been scientifically sent back in time to prepare ya
So start stoning the Babylonians to show you're controlling then
Cause this Babylon been fuelling my anger just like petroleum
I'm scolding them with the hard rhymes from a scarred mind
From living amongst the hard times
Where people just working through all of the serpentine
The devils disciple that stifle our plans for freedom
If wee keep conforming to all these laws set by the demons
They're thinking they're intellects
By plugging the whole world with the internet
If they thinking they got me they're information be incorrect
I'm using my third eye to guide I through the wilderness
Cause the system in Babylon's bad and there's enough people that's skilled in this
I'm vexed with the devils descendents with paganist pendants
For having the lack of faith and a disregard for repentance
My lyrical sentence is longer than people that's charged for child sex
Cause all the disordered leaders are into having a wild flex
I'm vexed with the government sects for giving this minimum wage
And working this nine 'til five bringing heat to my simmering rage
I spit this lyrical wisdom to charge down the Babylon systems
The rebellious Rastafarian that's flinging his fist to the system

[Phi-Life]
Listen Atti if the devil tries to take Selassie
Put some ? you lose more blood than the face of Arturo Gati
I'm a raw rhyming anti smoking idol keeping it tribal
While reading pages of the bible to gain vision as a disciple
Studying at rasta night school while using my tongue as a rifle
Sniping you worse than the bible cause life I'm all about survival
I spitting my violent recitals so bright that they melt your eyeballs
Turning the Anti-Christ suicidal wrestle the devil like Shawn Michaels
The clash of the titans will over crush the devil and take his title
Phi-Life will remain his messengers cause a rasta revival
No time to idle the rastas are rising black we come to wipe out crack
Paint the Whitehouse black and speak real fast to the children
Expose our government foes who know the truth will never be told
They teach the people the root of all evil while they're stashing all of the gold
Attacking their souls and spirits until your life is finished
Phi-Life I spit the righteous lyrics
Chained the minds of the cynics held the blind endemic
Cause when I talk my vocal is blessed with holy powers
Making the devils cower while shaking the foundations of the Babylon tower
I terminate them like T2 when I spit my scriptures in Hebrew
A politicians not an honest man like a hologram he be see-through
Trying to deceive you lead you up the path so that they can feed you
Phi-Life I'm a friend of races representing the rasta nation
So when we flex on a rhythm we draw on the powers of the law of exorcism
Inject the rhythm of the holy serum purify all the fat cats
Who experiment on innocent lives of people like they were monkeys or lab rats

[Cypher]
My  ? sound tear the transponders out of your pounds
And explode Babylon satellites that scanning down to the ground
With the type of coast to reveal we're living under a microscope
My cipher be strangling Babylonians with the tightest rope
I'm fringing the violence you can fuck with living with silence
Cause before long they be forcing us into buying a breathing licence
I'm dissing authority with my forces of purity
I piss in the parliament and I fart on the face of conformity
I never fill in the government census they cunningly sent us
It's asking me information like what I ate for my breakfast
Cause we the Messiah that's bringing more fire to the empire
With the type of tribal recitals that's setting Satan on fire
We're culling the paganist shaman the Phi-Life Cypher will slay them
Reveal the seventh seal to start the freemason complaining
With positive action infiltrates into paganist factions
I smashing your playstation and all these tools of distraction
With adequate satisfaction I smashing Babylon's walls
To stop all the gat cat bureaucrats from giving it all</pre>
