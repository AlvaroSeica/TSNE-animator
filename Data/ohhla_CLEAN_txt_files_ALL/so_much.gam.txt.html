# With the chorus, both people say it at the same time 

[Magic talking]
All this drama, and all this pain 
Sometimes I wonder if we all put here for a game 

chorus [2-4-1] {Gotti} 3X #
[So much drama, so much pain] 
{So much drama, so much pain, 
 all the casualties got us caught up in the game} 
[All the casualties, got us caught up in the game] 
{So much drama, so much pain,
 all the casualties got us caught up in the game} 

[Gotti]
Pitcure this drama, that we stuck in
Lookin' for wayz to keep from hustlin'
I wasn't born to be nothin'
And my muthafuckin' life is cursed 
And I plan to see these streets for everything it was worth 
And my momma lookin' at me like I was dead in a hurst 
Since the loss of my uncle, 
my pain it got worse And it hurts to see my
momm fallin' down in tears 
And to me, my life ain't clear 
Got me livin' in fear
Sheddin' tears
For my dead peers
Who's to blame 
For my muthafuckin' pain that I'm feelin' inside 

[Pheno] 
Well nigga don't cry keep your head up and roll wit' this pressure 
Control this pain that you feelin' cuz it's only to test ya 
Drama, I've been in since I left the wooms of my momma 
Still trynna cope wit situations left behind me 
Will I ever find another way 
Even though I pray 
Judgement day
Ain't far away 
&gt;From what my momma say 
But I'm trapped in this thug livin' and thug sinnin' Heavenly father
forgive me for all my drug dealin' 
Pressure and pain
All those that wanna make a change 
But all this drama got a nigga trapped in this game 

chorus 2X 

[Reginelli] 
I'm surrounded by so much drama, every day I visualize 
Walk the streets wondering I'ma die or stay alive 
I could recall bein' bad on the streets hustlin' for mine 
I use to hustle wit' dimes 
Now I'm hustlin' wit' rhymes 
The FEDz is watchin', 
the police is crooked Everywhere that a nigga go,
the law trynna book me 
I grew up in the ghetto I'm sheddin' tears 
And livin' in fear 
Late at night, trynna sleep, shots rang out my ears 
I'm present in this game, I feel the end is close 
The other day I could've sworn I see a fuckin' ghost 
It's hard to survive in the fuckin' N.O. 
You never know when it's YO time to go 

[Melichoir] 
They got me livin' in a world that's full of despize 
I can't cope wit' the authorities wit' this red in my eyes 
So I proceed across the battlefield bustin' for glory 
These demons preachin' for my soul, but I be damned if I'm buried 
I got shit to live for 
I got dreams to forfill 
If i die today or tomorrow, who gon' pick up the steel 
Don't let mind deceive ya, you either kill or get killed 
You muthafuckas ain't feelin' me, so it's best you get real 
These fuckin' laws got a nigga stressin' 
But I'm a thug 
Ain't no love on these streets for blacks wit' drawin' blood 
Crooked cops tryin' to throw all us blacks n the rump 
But lord protect us til' we make it home 
It's so much drama nigga 

chorus 1X 

[Magic]
It's my time
I can feel your pain
Nigga now allow me to spit some game 
Watch these stanky bitches beware a nigga that's lame 
You can die in the hands of a coward, so keep your eyes open 
I done seen alot of hard niggas die wit' their chest smokin' 
But have no worry Gambino Family cuz I'm on your side 
If any of them break your tradition, then I'll be down to ride 
Let no man question my dedication 
To whoeva it is, I'll whoop his ass in front the whole nation 
No interference from you outsidas 
I'm a rida 
You runnin' and runnin' while all the time I'm right behind ya 
Trust me like you trust your momma 
Popps ain't raise no punks, I'm know for bringin' drama
