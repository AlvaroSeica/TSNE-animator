[Intro]
Kush is my cologne, gone on that stupid strong
I know

[Chorus: repeat 2X - "I know" only first X]
Kush is my cologne, ku-kush is my cologne
Ku-kush is my cologne, gone on that stupid strong
Kush is my cologne, ku-kush is my cologne
Ku-kush is my cologne, gone on that stupid strong (I know)

[Bun B]
Got a Swisher filled up, with that one hitter quitter bro
Bubba for ya trouble on the double it'll get ya bro
Pass me the D's, light it up with ease
In a cirle full of G's, smokin on them trees
Pass me a cigar, and I'ma bust it down quick
Pass me the purple, make sure that hoe is round and thick
Break it down, fill it up, roll it up and light it
And you know it's the bomb, soon as it get ignited
Pimpin I cain't even fight it, it's callin me to smoke
So I fire up another square and take another toke
I be damn near goin broke, and my girl say I'm wrong
Shit but ("Kush is my cologne, gone on that stupid strong")
("I know")

[Chorus]

[Gucci Mane]
I'm inhalin it, exhalin it, it makes me more intelligent
I feel like I'm still mailin it or sellin it, they smellin it
Kush, purp', strong 'dro, what I need cologne fo'?
"They tried to send me to rehab but I said"
No, no, I won't go, damn it's really loud
Smellin like a whole pound, kush cologne, haze is her perfume
Bubba kush for breakfast, with my Captain Crunch
I smoke ten blunts befo' lunch, don't that sound like that's too much
(Gucci!) I'm so high, I'm so in the sky, everybody know
Marijuana is my fragrance probably smell it on my clothes
I smoke that bubonic sonic, hunger sippin gin and tonic
You lil' boys is hooked on phonics, Gucci hooked on chronic sonny!

[Chorus]

[E-40]
BEITCH! Lemme holla at 'em, UHH~!
I'm in this booch, hail the kiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiing
Hail the king, mayne I'm zapped
Man I've been smokin hella weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeed
Hella tweed, and I ain't talkin 'bout Twitter mayne
I'm talkin 'bout tweed - uh oh, look out!! Uhh
Liquored, twisted, bent down, probably won't know how I got home
Babu wanna jump my bones, she got her "fuck me" jeans on
"Fuck me" dress on, "fuck me" jeans on
"Fuck me" dress on, "fuck me" jeans on
BEITCH! Anythang, hollerin at a dame
Tryin to get brain but I don't know her name
Lookin at my chain, let me explain
Push cocaine but I don't make it rain
Gimme that gouda bitch, no extension
Pay me hoe, or pay me no attention
Send a botch, rock YouSendIt
MegaUpload, all up in it
Retirement plan, booch you my pension
Hater repellant my brand new invention
Everything that I say I meant it
Raised in the Bay where it's so pimpin
Raised in the Bay where it's so pimpin
Raised in the Bay where the bitched temptin
("Kush is my cologne, gone on that stupid strong")
("I know")

[Chorus]

[Devin the Dude]
Kush is my cologne, I got many fragrances
Shit gets so expensive but I hardly have to pay for shit
Every puff is like a squirt, smell it all off in my shirt
Co-workers give me compliments every time I go to work
What kinda cologne you on? 'Dro is like my aftershave
Have me feelin and smellin so good yo I don't have to bathe
But by all means, I must keep my balls clean
Make sho' my dick's legit then I go take care of the small things
And it all seems worth it
Fo' hundred and fifty's kinda steep but I deserve it
Weed smell so loud that you think you heard of that
Heard of that ("Kush is my cologne, gone on that stupid strong")
("I know")

[Chorus] {*fades out*}</pre>
