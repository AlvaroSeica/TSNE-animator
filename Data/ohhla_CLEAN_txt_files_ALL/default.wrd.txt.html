[Werd]
All I know
Gets penned with the ink and I'm thinking
I should go
Somewhere else because I felt I was sinking
Down so low
Getting high off the hash and the drinking
Though I know
Lifes fast it will pass if your blinking [x2]

You know who what where like Cludo
Werd rep the Burgh till I get them Euros
Sterling Dollars thats right pural
All cause I write get it right I'm new though
So you go damn stop you flow
Damn stop water cant stop my moves though
Move yo your moving too slow
We the only movement move like you dont
Put effort in looks effortless
At the top you can freeze like Everrest
So I never rest and you'd never guess
How I flip words well well Werd splits text
But Werds got stress cause Werds just left
Sitting alone with the smoke in my breath
Smoking to death and hopeing I'm next
I open a tin as I'm ropeing my neck

All I know
Gets penned with the ink and I'm thinking
I should go
Somewhere else because I felt I was sinking
Down so low
Getting high off the hash and the drinking
Though I know
Lifes fast it will pass if your blinking 

[Deeko]
Take your best emcees then stick them together
Then make it rain and we will put them pricks under the weather
You want to battle with the best wondering how we do it
Combining then form one creating the best music
I have said this from the begining you really should know by now
If you dont read up on the profile
This is Werd and Deeko such a deadly combination
Ones smoked out the other could drink you under the table
So forget about your deal mate its over
Because you'l never get picked up even if you had a chofer
My rhymes might go over your head like the wind blows
Trying to find my way to the top straight out of skid row
Right until the moment I strick and then I explode
Say that I'm Splifstarr you could put me on Flipmode
I pick foes who better stay on your tip toes
It just shows to cut check I slit throats
We go to shows the fans give us applause
Its why I'm still writing its not for the rewards
I want to make it big decided to take charge
Of my life and I did it with sixteen bars
I wont quit still working a full time job
You need to get paid to set your career off
I do it round the clock fuck taking a day off
Plus before I could walk was abke to make songs
Plus before I could walk was abke to make songs

[Werd]
All I know
Gets penned with the ink and I'm thinking

Somewhere else because I felt I was sinking
Down so low
Getting high off the hash and the drinking

Lifes fast it will pass if your blinking [x2]</pre>
