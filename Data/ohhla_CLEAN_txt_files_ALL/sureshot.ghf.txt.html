[Ghostface Killah]
Record spins, I'm going in
I don't shoot to kill, I play to win
Stay catching up with the cutthroats, cement shoeing niggas
Throw 'me off of tugboats, no floats
The body sinks to the bottom, or left on the side of the road, smell rotten
The murder sprees, random killings, Ghostface Killah is back attacking villains
Hanging from the ceilings
Godfather motives, gangsta mentality
Black superhero with the immortality
Forever, I be creeping in the blackness
Ill night vision with the militant tactics
I glide through the air like a swarm of Beez
Shake niggas off quick like a dog with fleas
Raw meat, leave bodies slumped in the street
Revenge is the spice of life, it's so sweet
Aiyo, pipe bombs, blowing they souls to Jesus
Don't need nothing but the perfect move for the pieces
Meat cleaver cut fingertips like ripped tits
Home invasions, cars gon' flip
DeLuca's lose, peers cement shoes
Tossed into the ocean, popped into there brain ooze, I won't lose
Blood all on my apron, hog tie 'em up while they try to escape
Peep the visual, tied them up individual
Took they clothes off, season the light sausage
Let the pits out to eat 'em, that's the remedy
Attack, kill, bite off the extremity
Blood baths, splash my name on the wall, call the pizza delivery
Leave a tip on the store, with a arm, leg, head, I'm coming for you all

*beat break*

[Ghostface Killah]
Uh-huh, it's the sure shot, yo
Yeah, heart of a lion, king of the jungle
I'm a humble Killa Bee, you as soft as a bumble
I don't crumble, I strike back hard with a vengeance
Attack through these killa words I spit in a sentence
I'm a menace, the black Clark Kent, caped crusader
The Face of a Ghost, I disappear into the vapors
You can murder my flesh and bones, souls invincible
Revenge my death, payback's the main principle
Protect Ya Neck when you move, I be lurkin' in the shadows
Starks the gangsta, nigga, I never lose battles
Ten bitches with a superhero logo on my chest
Big goosey link, GFK on the crest
Icey arm for the eagle, with the 8 karat ruby eyes
Piss on your muthafuckin' lawn while I'm stupid high
All blacked down, royalty purple and some ice chips
Two glock nines pointed at you in the hype flick

*beat break*

[Ghostface Killah]
Yo, yo, now I'mma alone in the room, and I just stare at the wall
Revenge my death, but I'm going through withdrawals
My large niggas I missed 'em, this new power and wisdom
Got me thinking I made a whole lotta bad decisions
Got Logan still to deal with, should I kill her?
Throw her fucking ass in the cage with a gorilla
Or let her live, then treat her like, scum of the Earth
I got goons to feed and, babies to birth
I'm the God now, west of a superish nigga
Do more help then harm, either way you figure
Should I protect and serve, or cock and end destruction
Let the Enterprise take over the force of production
Corruption, my mind state is unpredictable
I'm bulletproof now, back from the death, I'm invincible</pre>
