[Intro: 2Pac]
I hope it can work out tonight, what's up boy
I know we been seein' each other for a long time
And (hahaha) I'm hopin' tonight can be the night
Yeah, that's right

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Another shady mission, had enough of shady tricks
You so suspicious, like watchin' pictures and haze vision
Tonight is love makin', take you any place you wish
Today we satisfied, and tradin' slowly kisses
Blind insanity, perfect pictures of me and my family
Not understanding the destiny, had a plan for me
If I have kids, will I live to see 'em grow?
Tho' I don't know, I live the life of a Thug nigga until the day I go
Broken promises, a secret bound broken
I know I'll die alone, but yet and still I'm hopin'
Visions of prisons, maybe I'll be forgiven
I know it's better in heaven cause being here ain't livin'
Close my eyes and see nothing but pain, the worlds crazy
Still look for a queen to plant seeds and have babies
Maybe I'll be the one, or just maybe I'm lost
You'll never know, being cautious, and play yo cards right

[Chorus; Tyrone Wrice]
If you play your cardz right
Everythangs gonna be alright
If you play your cardz right
If you play your cardz right
Everythangs gonna be alright
If you play your cardz right
Tonight will be the night

[Verse 2: Big Syke]
I'm always in the mix
Life is full of tricks
I guess, tryin' my best
Nothin' less, before I lay to rest
My quest and future I'm mold like a new born baby
Intense and seldom to the world I'm so crazy
My daddy raised me to be a man, do the best I can
He said you won't succeed in life without a plan
It's hard to take my people trade me
With Indian hate, can't wait better change before it's too late

[Verse 3: Mopreme]
They got me at the bottom of a deck, searching for my Ace
I can't take too many jams, ain't much lovin' no place
Full of torman and soul, and it's written all in my face
Hollow inside, a crooked smile is the only trace
A mission slightly incomplete
Misconceptions of success and defeat
I rome these dark streets alone
Searchin' for yo homie, smokin' til I'm gone
when I need someone to kind of lay my praries on

[Chorus: Michel'le](2Pac talking over chorus)
If you play your cardz right
Everythangs gonna be alright (play your cards right)
If you play your cardz right (that's right)
(hahaha) (take your time nigga)
If you play your cardz right
Everythangs gonna be alright (play your cardz right)
If you play your cardz right (be patient)
Tonight will be the night

[Verse 4: EDI]
December 30 in nineteen-ninety fiend yeah
My reincarnation steps in born into a world
That don't love itself
But the love is wealth
My little nigga listen closely
If you don't remember nothing else
Just remember that life ain't nothing but a game
A gamble
And how you play your hand will sho' explain
For example
In times you gone journey into a crossroad
Get lost tho'
Keep on buryin' and let 'em see you walk up in
Floss mode

[Verse 5: Yaki Kadafi]
Mysteriously it seems
Through my deepest thoughts and dreams
It's all wrong, pop too long gone
And now 18, I'm stranded on my own
Abandoned here in the zone
Protect my throne
Pile like a king, Al Capone style
Lay no tracks on this rhyme
Coked up, with Craig I get mine
Livin' life as a Don, Guess Cortex, Louie Vuitton
With my pass behind me
And these triple connect set
Here to blind me, I know one day my future's
Going to find me and my crimey

[Chorus: Michel'le]
If you play your cardz right
Everythangs gonna be alright
If you play your cardz right
If you play your cardz right
Everythangs gonna be alright
If you play your cardz right
Tonight will be the night

[Outro: 2Pac]
If you play your cards right
Play your cards right
Take your time
Dont be in such a rush (haha)
Got to be patient man, be patient</pre>
