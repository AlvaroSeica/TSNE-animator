[Pete Nice]
Wisdom fatter than Buddha, ain't a heroin
Shooter or a storefront looter
Truer than a polygraph, walk with the big staff
But yo I got tricks up my sleeve you never thought I had
Do you like Muhammed Ali doing Liston
Take you to the cleaners like the pants that you pissed in
It's in poor taste why you're so busted
I got loot like a frank got mustard
Yeah, you run games but you ain't got equipment
All you got is kneepads for the sipping
I'm flipping you like Marv Albert on a slow-mo
The Prime Minister kicks the Willie Bobo

Kick the bo bo bo, I kick the bobo
I kick the bobo, I'm thinking of kicking the bobo (Repeat 4x)

Swift on the steel and prepare to rip mics
It's the Prime Minister, the Minister Pete Nice
I'm soul flexin', never had the specs in
20/20 vision, bust rhymes like erections
Wrecks in sleeper, never had a beeper
Ain't going out like a 40-deuce peeper
Thumbs get picked if you say you're plumb pickin'
No prejudice, black, white, or Puerto Rican
Moist moist plumbs, kinda swollen yup swollen
Kick the bobo then it's plumb's that you're holding
Domes get filled, 3 minus 1 equals 2
Daddy Rich knows what's true (Indeed)
What's that I hear? Are you broke, I'll make you broker
Lifespan dwindles like a candlestick smoker
Get a little taste of the Minister of Mojo
Quick on the solo, kicking all the bobo

Kick the bo bo bo, I kick the bobo
I kick the bobo, I'm thinking of kicking the bobo (Repeat 4x)

Back to the point, I bring you back to the point and
Hard to keep it true when the others are exploiting
Never got sidetracked, the others got punched black
Many fell victim, and fell into the booty shack
Make 'em disapper like the Brooklyn Dodger
Swinging on my thing, I swing 'em just like Roger
Don't sweat Madonna, Madonna got a bony ass
If you gotta pass gas, better leave the room fast
Bobo kicked like the bo that you be licking
What came first, yo, the pigeon or the chicken?
Do with the suspense, y'all, but I ain't hip
Cock going on tour a couple times around the block
Daddy Rich and Pete Nice never steer you wrong, B
Fatter than the fat kid in PM Dawn
Long time coming like skins to Quasimodo
So let's all kick the Willie Bobo

Kick the bo bo bo, I kick the bobo
I kick the bobo, I'm thinking of kicking the bobo (Repeat 4x)

*Pete Nice gives shoutout til the end*
