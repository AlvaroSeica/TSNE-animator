(*talking*)
The brick level (you know how we do it)
Be quiet nigga (naw I'm saying)
(real niggas, linked up) Callio', Nolia
(the brick level, ha feel that) murder

[Hook - 4x]
Murder us now, don't save us for later
If we come back, it's with them gats
And we gon search the equator, whodi

[Mr. Marcelo]
As danger approaches, fake niggas scatter like roaches
But I roll with them Tuff Guys, so we coming like vaulters
Packing them torches, connects from Cali to Moss
I get your ass knocked off, and it won't even cost me
All for the love, my thugs be busting them slugs
Ghetto nigga brick level, leave your face in the mud
Chunking what's up, we real niggas straight from the 'jects
Put some niggas on a jet, and have em wet up your set
Show em my tech, man I heard you had a vest on
All shot that hit your block, went through your teflon
If you're there you catch one, so guard your hat
If not and I miss, nigga I'll be back
Believe that, cause can't nothing stop us dog
This the Nolia and the Yo, and we above the law
When them two projects hook up, we like terrorists
So when you fuck with brick, you in some serious shit nigga

[Hook - 4x]

[Popeye]
I got the right to get my route, surround the violent projects
So give me my 'spect, holding position for you be twisted getting dissect
From my tech, or will tell me they got a hard head
Open leave you in broad dead, listen to what the Lord said
Thou shalt not kill, but only hear us niggas live on fire
And take what's yours of course, we never give on
Whoop on a fiend, maybe was short and trying to run game
But what the fuck, cause nigga they money is how the fun came
You son lame, to kidnap my hoe and trail her to you
Testing a nigga nuts, trying to see what cell I go through
But yo fuck that hoe the shit could be soft, by me and you
Big man calling the shots, I bet you be fleeing too
If you came through the cut though by seconds, to let you ride fast
Here go on through this eye class, lay down with your tied ass
A ripped up system, I only missed him but twice
Murder done took him over, left him shaken like dice nigga

[Hook - 4x]

(*talking*)
See, it's just like shots keep blasting
When my bullets come, them bitches keep mashing
Who is you asking, I'm the motherfucking main attraction
And I'm bout that action, my money is stacking
Fake ass niggas is talking, but lacking
Nigga you got the trigga finger itching
But I'ma have your fucking mama wishing, that you never crossed me
