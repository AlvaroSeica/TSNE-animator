[Nicki Minaj]
Ahh Huh, Ahh huh, Yo a yo
I was on the plane wit Dewayne
You can call me whitley I go to hill mane
Listen, I'm the baddest in the school, the baddest in the game
Excuse me honey but nobody's in my lane
When you was in New York, you was fuckin' the yankee
I was fuckin' wit base I was pitchin' to franky
These bitches so cranky, give em' a hanky
lil mommy I'm cold gimme my blanky

[Interlude]
Wooah Wooah Wooah Wooah Wooah Wooah Wooah,

When you was in New York, you was fuckin' the yankee
you was fuckin' wit base I was pitchin' to franky
These bitches so cranky, give them a hanky
My mommy I'm cold gimme my blanky
Flyer than a kite I get higher then Rapunzel
Keep the snow white I could buy it by the bundle
Step your cookies up for they crumble
Don't be actin' like the cardinals and gone fumble (fumble)
'Cause I'm a steeler fresh up out the dealer
All the dope boys gone feel her. Flow so sick I need a healer
fuck is my M.A.C concealer
I be out in queens on the back of four whee whee whee whee whee whe wheelers
I'm a big deal
That's why I get more head than a pigtail
Pussy Mansion I'm gettin' the munchies
I think Ill have a rap bitch for my entree'
'Cause they be thinkin' niggas spit, spit shine my shoes
You know I keep a bad bitch let me sign your boobs
I'm the only thing hoppin' like a kangaroo
I mean the only thing poppin' like a can of brew
Listen u should buy a sixteen 'cause I write it good
That 808 woof woof 'cause I write it good
And bitches can't find they man 'cause I ride it good
I'm the wolf where is little ride-uh riding hood
now if you see a itty bitty piggy in a market
Give that bitch a quarter and car tell her park it
I don't fuck wit pigs like osalamalekam, I put em in a field
I let Oscar Myer bake em.
And if you see a itty bitty piggy in a market
Give that bitch a quarter and car tell her park it
I don't fuck wit pigs like osalamalekam, I put em in a field and I let Oscar
Myer bake em.

[Outro]
It's like I'm just single handedley anilated,
You know every rap bitch in the building
Like like I'm Nicki Minaj, Nicki Lewinsky, Nicki the ninja, Nicki the boss,
Nicki the Harajuku Barbie
Like I mean I don't even know why you girls bother at this point
Like give up, its me, I win you lose
Hahahahahahaha o shit hahaha yo

Hahahahahaha
