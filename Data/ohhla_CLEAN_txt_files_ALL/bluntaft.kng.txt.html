Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1 - King Lil G]
I been blowin' heavy smoke
With the criminals
My future was never promised
But grindin' that was my principle
Would you believe it
If I told you people put me down
How the fuck when homie
You still livin' at your mothers house
You can't tell me shit
I made it happen solo
These cowards wanna start some beef
Cause they thirsty for promo
I never told you I'm a perfect person
I'm livin' day by day
Trying to feed my family
With a couple verses
Dead bodies in hearses
Your funeral service
I'm rollin' marijuana
Searchin' for a perfect surface
Tellin' stories of my past
But its irrelevant
The homies put in so much fucken work
And there's no evidence

[Chorus]
I'm rollin' blunt after blunt
Taking flights to different places
I'm faded as fuck
I'm rollin' blunt after blunt
Went from 40oz bottles
To ace of spades in my cup
Smoke a blunt with me
Fuck all the drama
And all the bullshit you goin' through
Roll up &amp; smoke a blunt with me
Soon as I land I get a txt from my people
Talk about roll up &amp; smoke a blunt with me

[Verse 2 - Reverie]
Come gimmie, come listen
Twistin' up that louie
Its vital in my position
My rivals ain't on my tip
And survival is hit or miss
This the final cut you ain't an og
Like vinyl's I'm the shit
Cause I'm equipped with knowledge
Mc techniques well polished
Kept my promise, paid my homage
So you know your girl going all in
I'm calling out haters
People asking for favors, anti-innovators
And any friend I'm a end up beefing with later
Eyes hella droopy
My life like a movie
Roll up hella doobies
Ojos red as rubies
Love ain't shit to me
Who be trying to bark
With your stuck up ass
Ain't no time for negativity
Homie puff puff pass

[Chorus]</pre>
