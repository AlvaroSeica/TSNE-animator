[Trey Songz]
Now I've done had lots of relationships
Aint none of them ever added up to shit
My folks they always told me what you wish
Be careful cause that one thing you could get
So I prayed to the Lord to send me love
Send me something like an angel from up above
But instead I got a chick who played on my heart
She had me feeling good then tore me apart

[Chorus]
Love ain't supposed to feel this way
Love ain't supposed to hurt or cause you pain
Love ain't supposed to make me cry
But now I'm trying to wipe my eyes
Love ain't supposed to feel this way
Love ain't supposed to hurt or cause you pain
Love ain't supposed to make me cry
But now I'm trying to wipe my eyes

[Trey Songz]
She was like the devil in disguise
Spending time with me and thinking of other guys
And even though I tried my best
I cant describe the way she made me feel
All over a girl, who never gave her all
Never gave me much, when it came to love
I dont know why I spent so much time
On a love that wasn't mine
And the pain is so unkind

[Chorus]

[Trey Songz]
Now it ain't even worth my time
Love ain't supposed to feel like I'm losin my mind
I once was blind but now I see
The girl was playin games she ain't the one for me
I'm tryin to told ya, if you find a love
Just don't close your eyes, you might go blind
Got to keep it smart, give it all your heart
If you fall to far in love you'll find the hard way

[Chorus]</pre>
