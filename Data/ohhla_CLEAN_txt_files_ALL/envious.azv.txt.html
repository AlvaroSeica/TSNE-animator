[Intro: Bounty Killer] (AZ)
Cross!!! Angry!!! (Yeah!)
Aiyyo you know it's Bounty Killer and AZ (Stand in attention)
No if's no buts no maybes (Single file)
Aiyyo yallo! Motherfuckin niggaz clear out (Carry your flags)
Warlord in the buildin (It's the art of war)
Aiyyo yallo! I got this fuckin forty five willin
(Fire they lost power) I caught dem stealin
(Bounty Killer) yo!!! (AZ) Lawd a mercy (Soldiers at war) huh!

[Verse 1: AZ]
If you Crip get your Crip on sip get your piff on
Never slip I'm in the mix with the fifth long
Never riff see me fixin on my lip balm
Chip charm chillin with them Gucci kicks on
But like the Kiss song niggaz get shit wrong
To a bliss fully flipped and they gettin pissed on
Life ain't a sitcom gotta keep your wisk on
Shit niggaz bitch other snitch like Nick Bonds
Pick chrones pick 'em up switch pawns
Pick 'em up get 'em tuck get gone see it's on
Some got warned got laid got torned
Got shot got saved got mourned

[Chorus: Bounty Killer]
War dem want with us, why they come start it up
We know they won't give up, when they gone bite the dust
They are envious, so our guns we buss
In the lord we trust, war they wantin

[Verse 2: Bounty Killer]
Yo! Who now piggy gone a yuh a mystery
Di last dem see yuh waan a receive a history
Brush mi wid knife and promise yuh a go fist we
Badman nah trace and crb like Mitzi
Bullet mi a go give dem bout sixty
Fried and dem crew dem haffi leave inna jiffy
Gunshot a mek di fassy speak inna gypsy
From Brooklyn to Poughkeepsie, cross

[Chorus: Bounty Killer]
War dem want with us, why they come start it up
We know they won't give up, when they gone bite the dust
They are envious, so our guns we buss
In the lord we trust, war they wantin

[Verse 3: AZ]
I'm cool with them Pirus cool with them die moves
Any death this way niggaz a die too
Cry who y'all won't do me like Ja Rule
Jewels all sky blue smooth since High School
Fuck with a why do with me it's why who
You sneeze you liable to leave we hostle
You apostle, son of pop duke
Cop cruise to move to top roof
Got loose and left them high stoops
The rest is my new respect to my troops
Give me boose some juice some grey Goose
And word to Jesus it's back to Beirut

[Chorus: Bounty Killer]
War dem want with us, why they come start it up
We know they won't give up, when they gone bite the dust
They are envious, so our guns we buss
In the lord we trust, war they wantin</pre>
