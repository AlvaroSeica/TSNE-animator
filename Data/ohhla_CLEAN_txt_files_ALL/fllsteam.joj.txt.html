[JoJo Pellegrino]
Through this night, they going to get you iced, goin' the Full Steam
Music's my life, craving to spit through mics, I literally fiend
I get caught with this coded key, I can forget my dreams
I want money, powder and respect, and everything in between
Fuck like a movie star, killer's snitch, givin' tips like a nutty bar
Staten Island and anybody can get it, no matter who you are
Heats spray, put hollows in guns, spring round at you goones
Each day I rise with the sun, lay down with the moon
Light herbs inspire poses, you whack with foolish raps
My word is like wolves, they move in packs, shooting rats
Ooh perhaps we should find out what happens in combat
When rappers slap your dick, you cap off and crack your hard hat
Stop that, hit chicks, kick classy flows and get money
Leave my mark like spaceship's throwin' grassy nodes into countries
Carpenter's saw carving your jaw, get rocked if you raw
And elbows on the arm, I'm a gun-trepreneur</pre>
