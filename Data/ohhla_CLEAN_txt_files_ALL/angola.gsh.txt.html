Song:   Angola, Louisiana
Typed by: [transcribed from jacket sleeve]

Well I'm feeling fine
I could've been doing time
Well, I'm doing fine, thank you
but I could've been pulling time

I know a brother man doing time
and he didn't commit no crime
So, thank you, I'm doing fine
cuz I could've been pulling time

I've been painting a picture of Angola, Louisiana
pictures of deals in back alleys where politicians often hide
But it's much more important to me than Angola, Louisiana
Got a lot to do with justice but more with Gary Tyler's life
I got a letter from his mother (that) said
"Please! Say somethin to my son."
Truth is: Angola, Louisiana, you're the one

I ain't never been nowhere near Angola, Louisiana
Down in St. Charles Parish where the sun won't go alone
But injustice is not confined to Angola, Louisiana
It can walk in your livin room
as long as it surrounds your home
I send love to brother Tyler, but after all is said and done
Truth is: Angola, Louisiana, you're the one

I can't tell a man not to defend himself
not at this late stage
I can't tell a man he got no rights, nowhere
not in this day and age
This song may not touch a whole lot of people
persuaded by the truth
but take a look at what's goin on, people
'cause this all could happen to you

I've been painting a picture of Angola, Louisiana
Down in St. Charles Parish, where the sun won't go alone
But injustice is not confined to Angola, Louisiana
Well, it can be in your living room
Brother Tyler, hold on, be strong, you're not alone!
I got a letter from his mother that said
"Please, say something to my son!"
Truth is: Angola, Louisiana, you're the one</pre>
