Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Wanna sit beside a sick and seductive sinner, see
Somethin so sinister, sick as succus, I'm like a centipede
Slitherin, she's searchin for synergy
Suckin my seed, chakra tease thick as sippin Hennessy, shittin
On the hissin I'll spit you outta commission
Position the bitch and dip in when a mitch is slippin, submission
All of this is the quick-in, the copulatin and kissin
My operation is rippin to the bottom, shakin and strippin
Odd when I bust, K.O.D. put em in Necropolis
Givin' this rod to the good broads, and they givin they bras to us
With the gift to break up a couple that's monogamous
Stop with the props and take off your effin draws, bitch and rock with us!
Been gitty cause them titties, are on my chin-chinny
Chin, did he pretend he was a gin kitty?
Suckin the crÃ¨me de la crÃ¨me and the skin pretty
Dim liddy, then hittin the drim in Sin City
Let it in, I'm the medicine, get her wetter than ever been
Never better than a veteran, leveled that in the bed again
Rockin red, I've been in my letterman, bright as Edison
Like I said a sin, head her when events end and I'm fetishin
Open up, you hoes, you know what's up
Told you when I bust, her clothes they wanna just
Go run off her butt, fo sho they wanna cut
Explode, drop a load, cause the flow, is

[Chorus: Tech N9ne]
So dope they wanna (fuck)
So dope they wanna (suck)
So dope they wanna (give it all up and really abrupt)
So dope they wanna (fuck)
So dope they wanna (suck)
So dope they wanna (give it all up and really abrupt)
So dope they wanna (fuck)
So heroin, so cocaine, so ketamine, promethazine, so X (so wet)
So thorazine, so morphine, so dope that they wanna have sex

[Verse 2: Wrekonize]
She said "I heard that you was packin' I'm a fan of your rapping
I'm feining action where you really from, Cape Town?"
I said "yeah bitch and I was born in London
So I'm thinkin' 'bout fuckin' you with the crumpets and some cake now!"
How did we get so, stereotypical?
Feelin' so seminal, now I'm flowin' to the pinnacle
I see you got some friends who just lookin' to get it from the medic so I'm a 'bout to pivot on 'em and I make rounds
Want a piece of the beast from the East?
Complete, in the sheets, release beats, got her man down
Your boy just never could compete with us, please, better believe
We skeet, now wipe yourself off with a Sham Wow!
Me and Nina run deeper than receivers, I beat up all on her beaver
Now she wanna feed the meter!
Speakers bumpin' tweeters from here up into Medina leave us pleasin'
Are your nieces screamin' "Take me to your Leader! "?
I'm train spottin' the vein rockin' the lane off and came droppin'
Serious game all on your brain, rottin'!
Pick a million pricks and I'm pretty sure that you missed the one
That hits you on the clit, quick drip! Probably ya main option
Blowin' the slut up just for good luck and I'm fuckin' the kitty up
But the angel just stole my nuts!
Trophy lovin' cup and my dopin' is such a mustered
It's troublesome they give up when the lust is so dope they wanna-!

[Chorus: Tech N9ne]

[Verse 3: Twisted Insane]
Loving to give it up in it in the back of the room
And make em screamin' go up in it deep as she was feindin' when she saw my weiner
She told me ready for anything, I'm talkin' anything
I'm stuck it up in her jaws, I'm breakin' walls, like I was Katrina
Don't even know me, but she know my flow is O.G.
She told me she like to play with the pussy when she get lonely
Homie if I was only right there instead of the saw me
She claimin' the pussy better but tell me better just show me
She ask if I'm comin' up with the mask in my entrance
Sinner in a second I spit it like Like every sentence
She was there for repentance first is top of the infant
I'm damagin the vagina, reminda I'm filled with vengeance
Hit em whenever they ever wanna run up and they doin it because I rap and shit
I really don't care, whatever it takes, to get em up on the matt-er-ess
I coulda been the one that's huntin run bust with the gun but this is way more fun to get
To get up in this motherfucker natressess
In bikinis and suckin on my zuchini
She told me she wanna be me while sippin that from Martinis
Fuck it if I'm a meanie she probably would never leave me
Shit I can play eenie meanie from frontin from my weenie
And now I see em on every record and stage
They posted up in the audience and all of em filled with hope
Knowin they only wanna be in my presence
Or Affiliated because truth is you are Dope

[Chorus: Tech N9ne]

[Verse 4: Snow Tha Product]
You know Tech, you know I've been the type
To not go all in, on hoes I've been around
They got no common sense
They position, is probably insignificant
And they been
Now they be hoggin
Cause they all gon bark like that
Give em the game, give em the game give em the game
So he can let, he wanna bang
Cause I got that sickinant style, that built me a crowd
And men and women feelin me now
Cause I'm just here to figure it out
And they tell me that they women is down, they gettin aroused
And they be tryna give me they child, with a genital smile
They say they wanna</pre>
