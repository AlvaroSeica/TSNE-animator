(INTRO-Jemini)
Introducin' my main man Danger Mouse, Super Producer
And they call me Jemini the Gifted One...The emcee

[CHORUS-Jemini]
I was Born-A-MC, I was born to rhyme
I was born to write and resight it and express myself
I was born a emcee
I was born to rhyme, I was born to spit to you get it and express myself

[Jemini the Gifted One]
Yo, yo
The bigger they come, the harder they fall
Danger Mouse and Jemini puttin' the writin' upon the wall (true)
For people to read, I'm doin' this cause I need people to see, and touchin' a feelin'
And enter the spirit that is runnin' through me, I was born emcee
So when I was young I said I wanna emcee, gonna emcee, using me
At 3:00 am in front of BoDangles, eatin' Potato Chips, n
Watchin' the day go by, with dreams of the day that I get paid to rhyme
And probally why I stay so high, blazen' alot
But now a days we call it "puffin' the trees", nigga's ain't high
But now a days we call everybody emcee's
I don't mean to preach, but emcee's a level that you gotta reach
Respectin' history, be open to learn, and what it will teach
I master each and every lyrical style that you'll ever need
So lyrically-musically spiritually, guess that womens all you'll ever need
Please believe!
Uh-huh, uh-huh

[CHORUS-Jemini]
I was Born-A-MC, I was born to rhyme
I was born to write and resight it and express myself
I was born a emcee
I was born to rhyme, I was born to spit to you get it and express myself</pre>
