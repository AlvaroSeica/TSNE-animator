[Santigold]
Now won't you run and tell your boyfriend
Tell him don't hold his breath for me
I got some money, I was savin, got some hearts that I'll be breakin
Know someday they'll make a martyr out of me
I know someday they'll make a martyr out of me
She's so fine

[Chorus]
And I like sometimes to wave it high, up where everyone can see
I'm a lady; got my mind made up, got my mind made up
I know I spin magic, reel it out, try to hold a light to me
I'm a lady; got my mind made up, got my mind made up

[Santigold]
I like to watch the way the wind blows
What does it know that I don't yet?
Oh oh, look so pretty now, you're just so sweet
But see how far you can get
See just how far you can get
She's so fine

[Chorus]

[Trouble Andrew]
And the dream's all, gone
And the dream's all gone
No one said no, no one said
Make something with, what's in your head
And the dream's all, gone
And the dream's all gone

[Chorus] - 2X

[Santigold]
Got my mind made up {*3X*}
Got my mind made up, got my mind made up
Got my mind made up {*3X*}
Got my mind made up, got my mind made up
And I like sometimes to wave it highm up where everyone can see
I'm a lady...</pre>
