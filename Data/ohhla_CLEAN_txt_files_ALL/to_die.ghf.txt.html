[RZA]
Unable to become immortalized in life
Ghostface became immortalized in death
Creating a mayhem so vast
That the tale of his rampage would be passed down for generations
Gangstas told there children to never double cross a man
Whose will is so strong
That he could cross the planes of existence, to get his revenge
And there you have it, the story, of the Ghostface Killah</pre>
