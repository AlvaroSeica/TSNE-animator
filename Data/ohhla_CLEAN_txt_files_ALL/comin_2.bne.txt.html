Intro:
Alright, now let's do this (Flesh) 
Knocc Out and Flesh, my glock to techs
We comin' 2 serve ya (BG Knocc Out)
Knocc Out and Flesh, with tha glock cock
And you know I'm screamin' murda mo' murda x2

[Flesh]
Rippin' up, it's yo' St. Clair
Takin' money that's straight, and gotta kick it, chill
Then makin' it real, to the pop on my slug for love
I'm gonna feed you with BG Knocc Out
Drop these bullets in a grill for the skill
Motha Fuckas with double, meat is when it's on
My fox cause to this, is a rock gets clock
And a grip now ready to rough house

[BG Knocc Out]
Betta with coppas and his guns. 
Sendin' bodiez off yet, for the redrum
Six feet in a ditch is where I'm leaving you bitch-ass niggas
So come, come. Mo' victim to tha crome, it's on
Leavin' bodiez strapped up, and I kill 'em all, mo' mo'
Bitch-ass niggaz from the other side, wanna try me, come rock
'Cause the nigga don't know

[Flesh]
I really help, can't contain us, bring 'em out
Fuck with the sinners and rap shit, kick names out yo' mouth
I'm crossin' my nigga and he got rapid
To be killas that flip, every blood drip I pray
Like a self diplp Souljah Boy from makin' niggas
Won't grab ?, take it from here to Towhee

[BG Knocc Out]
That's why I'm here, hit them down with than AK 
Leavin' bodiez straight down in the wrong day
All you niggaz if you wanted that shit
Can't wait 'till you bitch-ass niggas come my way
To the hallway, nigga all day
To the peace treat, nigga ain't no love
Ain't no way in hell, you'll buck with B.G. Knocc Out
Flesh, and ah Mo' Thug, straight up

Chorus x4

[BG Knocc Out]
I'm comin' 2 serve ya, serve ya
I'm screamin' mo' murda, mo' murda
Hopin' you'll die, don't ask me why 'cause you deserve to
Deserve to, got yo' cap hit back to the black. Which one?
That one with the automatic strap
Have the ones with the all black, black
So take a nigga straight off the map
That's how I feel about any nigga that's willin' to deal
Willin' to deal
Put a nigga like Knocc from my with the glock cock
'Cause I wanted to kill
Niggas talk like a disease
Drop to your knees and give me your g's
Nigga you can't get with these, nigga please

[Flesh]
See you betta be takin' your loss and then I don't know
Betta be gone, and I run up in him if I came
Be the master plans, leavin' ya minds off
Close to 44 magnums, hit the hold and ah so when I blast it
Creepin' yo' bloods be peepin', you run oh nigga in a river
Sin, sippin' gin, get out tha party get in if niggas we clown
Ready get scandlous. Where?
In the cities, run from the one they don't purchase a pound
Get to tha nigga, they drop ya
Grab my pump, pump, cock the glock, shot ya
By thaegang we let off go bullet ranges
For the same we comin' 2 serve ya

Chorus x4

[Flesh]
Niggas, make the cities both screams
Lil' Knocc Out hitter, help me solve this
We shinin', never had peace
Celebrate the victory, runnin' with it flawless
Gonna keep dodgin', playa hatas fall 
and never stood a chance, up against Flesh mo'
My niggas send them to the maka I'm lovin' it
And you really don't wanna test
Hate these niggas, wanna push they luck
Fuckin' with the 5th dog, show no love
Except for my gang, runnin' untamed
Hope you don't rename and remain Mo' Thug
Had my nigga, my slug
Haters police blood, that is when I'm gonna serve ya
Chasin' mothafuckas with the gun
Get them on the run, but ?

[BG Knocc Out]
Pullin' yo' trigga on niggaz, 'cause nigga
they know they can't hang with tha Mo' Thug gang
Sonn as ya run up off, I'm pullin mine
Gut 'em 'till ya done, but some gotta blow out yo' brain
Come to these, rock with the hot glock, bodies in the Glock
Pop, pop, pop, nigga never don't stop
Buck with the Knocc I'm ready to go spot with 
the Glock lettin' off shots, niggas gon' drop
To the pave, put it in tha grave 
Now they dwell in hell 'cause we double slay
The clip and the trigga, a sin
Now that's in the river nigga, try to lift me hey
Say, Knocc and Flesh glock, glock to takes it comin' 2 serve ya
Swerve to the curve
Better off that chronic and and burn
Nigga it's time to murda

Chorus x4

[Flesh] 
Hey niggas? 
Hey niggas?
Murda, mo' murda
