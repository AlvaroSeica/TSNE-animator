Committee style baby
Uh Huh, for all the freaks
Yeah that's right
Yeah

(Chorus)  (x2)
[Luc Duc]
You don't love me you love my doggy style
And I'm known to keep it wild like the Ok Carol
And what you 'lax with just ain't my style
50 feet ain't enough I need at least a mile

[Verse 1]
I only roll in the fattest whips, got mega chips
Hanging out with some of the baddest bitches, with mega hips
Sexy lips with the Hazel eyes, got to have plenty thighs
Rolling Acura's with Slip-N-Slide
All my niggas ride,
With the heaters on the front seat, only one deep
On the semi with a bad freak, always on the creep
Chickens ride mother plucking but that ain't nothing
And she down for the sucking fucking hit it on the button
And it's something like some more clucking from my bucking
The KFC when it comes to busting
We stay on crushing
But they got to holla for that dollar
So when I holla out the window of my friends Impala
You know I got her
When she go to looking at her friends
And turn around and started giving me that half a grin
It's foggy and my homie sipping on some yen
Run some came and my name then I know I'm in
Oh that's your cousin
Even better when I'm drinking yen
On the average player scale she about a 10
And her cousin too cause she got some beautiful skin
We picked em up, knock em up
Kicked em out and did it all again
Cause

(Chorus)  (x2)

[Verse 2]
I be having more game then a little bit
So little dick niggas acting like they big shit
Y'all need to quit, my style be flowing like it's liquid
Them ghetto girls be dropping them drawls 
Them girls y'all can't get wit
I hit it from the back and known to leave an imprint
My little sister even known for spitting that pimp shit
My little brother he the brain we call him gifted
Some women hate me so they put me on they shit list
Because I'm known for breaking them off with a stiff dick
And breaking out before they even know I had a trip
Goddamn baby you got some beautiful lips
Sometimes I'm wondering if a nigga picked a fit
I fuck them to the point that they screaming that they got to piss
A freaky nigga but you can keep a chain and whip
And every time I bust I'm 'bout to sink your battleship
I hit and run, sorry hun, but I got to dip
I told your sister that I'd hit her right around six
And if I'm late then you know that bitch gonna wanna trip
You in love with a thug baby get a grip
I bust a nut and if you lucky I might leave a tip
You know why

(Chorus)  (x2)
