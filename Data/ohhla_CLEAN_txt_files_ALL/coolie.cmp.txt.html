You need to come inside and check Lo
Relax yourself and let the sugar Lo flow
Coolie High got you wide
You need to come inside and check Lo
Relax yourself and let the sugar Lo flow
Coolie High keeps you wide
You need to come inside and check Lo
Relax yourself and let the sugar Lo flow
Coolie got you wide
You need to come inside and check Lo
Relax yourself and let the sugar Lo flow

Verse One:

Its rainin alizay
Im floatin through the Holland tunnel swervin
Im diggin on the Sheeba
Pullin Sheeba she be splergin
We lurkin with the coon
Cuz we be murkin from the boogie
And shittin on the crowds
Cuz they jive fakin woody

Yeah..
Tre shots of life for all night you dig it
Camp-ah hotta pinata
Too big quiver get hipper
Spillin coffee inside my automo' Aldo 
Crackin satin and leather
What's happenin bullet convincer
Cash straight outta comic.. 
Books catchin the flurry
Keep your eye on the Lo
Where Mr....

Cuz we comin wit hammers and drivers
With the buddahs and rugars
And shot cruisers and rovers
Diamond crooks.. takin it over
With razors and cutters
With the sugar and butters
Pimp the seasons in leathers
We live for Coolie High treasures
And..

Check the queen bee Lady Ree diggin Grace
Check the place 3 o clock shat no we aint
Fred and Cot bring it in the paint no such thing
Blasts of dynamite sing my superfly to the..
Cleopatra in the casino with gold sugar
Dig my harlequinn 
And drench you with my diner garments

From Beva to Bevro in the Montaro slidin to Dero 
With bottles of Asti Spumanti to tranquilize my heaven
Count seven we gettin explicit shootin sugar to the shorties
Luchini to spare let me see you
Its losin the air
Word life

Chorus:

You need to come inside and check Lo
Relax yourself and let the sugar Lo flow
Coolie High got you wide
(repeat 3X)

You need to come inside and check Lo
Relax yourself and let the sugar Lo flow

Verse Two:

Lo keeps the party live
The 80 proof is leakin got me screachin 
Jersey Drive
We screamin cuz we {?} caliber is bring it
Im layin in the purple rain until I see some action
We movin motionless.. continuos and thats happenin

We got the bubbly pourin through me and Cleopatra's casino
See back in Coolie High Jack and Jitterbugs and {?}
Dolemite's outta site Anti-hatahs cats in the city
On the money takin the tri-state under sore savant
Billy Holidayin' the Foxy Browns with my Harlequinns
Penny he repellin reflected crystals is Hollywood

Dont pull the stars 
Cuz we lickin Cuban cigars.. and sippin Moe
Playin the jigga cotton 
The figgas on the Lo and Lo
Blessin the dimes 
Keepin my Camp is on the higher flow
Livin the crimes hittin them slide 
For the c-note

Yo..
President city
Pourin right on the JJs and Sautee
Cab Callowayin the last of the finest Shot Sirus
Christ is comin lower
with Jiggas less to zero that
Sex the Lo
Dice the Lo
Ill tell you what
On the night vision decision underneath the silver moon
Boy from company C A day sugar love

Chief be for stonin
Robbin chero be for midnight
The safety's off the toaster
And my shadow's by the moonlight
Cuz Data's on the levels and the Lo is on the EQ
My stamina is sugar
And its love love forever yall

Chorus
