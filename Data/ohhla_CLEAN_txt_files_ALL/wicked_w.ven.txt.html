[Venom]  What's up perro
[Conejo] Damn carnal, I got set up by one of these wicked hynas
[Venom]  Que quieren guerra
[Conejo] Simon que si, so what's up Pelon, what's up Veneno
         You vatos gonna do me a paro
         I wanna handle mine

[Pelon]
The touch of the money made me do it again
With the reliable methods of running the game
Always on the top and will never fall down
Pero si van a cayer, ese bombas all around
Letting vatos know who really runs the show
Pelon, Venenoso y las Puertas del Infierno
Y al lado esta mi perro Bandido
(La guerra esta critica, matamos enemigos)
Derecho hasta rifa, making feria taking gold
And that's to let you know ese about this wicked world
The riches, the bitches, my ranfla is tough
Vatos quieren guerra, my endless loquera, la neta
I'm insane like cocaine
Mi vida es un deporte, Ese Pelon from the Gates
Chales, porque puta te sales
La area es dos trece y viente cinco es la calle

[Chorus x2: Conejo]
Deadly they can be, these wicked women
And all because of them I have turned into a demon

[Venom]
Me tengo que cuidar, me quieren imbujar
I seen the serpent through his deadly venom
And all these wicked women, ooh they just persist
I get along with all I can, can't take this shit
Inside my mentality I'm thinking brutality
All planned decisions, terrifying missions
Times are hard ese, these times are hard
All bitches rattle with no regard
Still in Hell, I'm a bird, look who just returned
It was only natural to break that heart
Now she wants to meet me where the streets are dark
These rucas want to set me so these vatos could get me
As I go through a path of extreme misery
Battlefields and overlapping cemeteries
Poison in the air for those well aware
No shame in my juego, el terrible Veneno

[Chorus x2]

[Conejo]
No wonder they're not trusted, they're all wicked women
Looking for the righteous, but the righteous even sin
For example, enemy territories
Conejo's gonna risk it even though there's consequences
She's by my side, I'm on top of the world
There's nothing that can stop me, I'm the Duke of Earl
She adapted to my style in no time at all
Though I trust no bitch, she'd catch me if I fall
Took a night on the town, there's unfamiliar faces
All the gun slingers have revolvers at their waistes
One foolish act by this immature vato
Grabbed my hyna's ass, I almost shot the vato
Baby interfered, 'mijo it's not worth it'
Back to the canton, and made the night worth it
De volada, cuz I'm just a little demon
Searching for the one that'll be my wicked women

[Chorus x3]

[Conejo]
Indeed, I have a story to tell
About these wicked women with their black magic spells

[Chorus x2]</pre>
