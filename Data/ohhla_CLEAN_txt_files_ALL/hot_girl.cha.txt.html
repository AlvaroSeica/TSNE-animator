[Chamillionaire talkin']
is you a hot girl if not girl
can't be touchin' my hot spot girl
I can't in that cot girl
i'm runnin' wit Michael Watts girl
this is our world what you can't you tell
just look at the ice on my benzale
I bet it's green but it ain't stale
TVs in a 6 hundred V12
while the beats swell and I'm slugged up
the camillion be teted and thugged up
my money be gettin' all jealous
you gotta move I can't be hugged up
they bugged up selective sounds that offence
some ballers blockin' watchin' they knock us
cuz we ridin' and can't even drop us
on choppin' they love that
I see that big ass and I love that
like juvenile back that ass up in my direction
and let me rub that
swishahouse don't need to dub that
go get you some swishahouse sock
go get you some new shoe
put swishahouse on top of your reeboks
boy if your tryin' to get rich
go and get some swishahouse stock
cuz if it ain't platinum or gold
then it didn't come from that Michael Watts</pre>
