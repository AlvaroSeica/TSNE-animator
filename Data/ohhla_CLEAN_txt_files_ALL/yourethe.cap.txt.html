(Just You and Me)

[Girl]
You're the one for me

[Mr. Capone-E]
That's right
This is Mr. Capone-E
Droppin dis song for all the lovers (baby when we cruise together)
That's Right
You're the one for me (you're the one for me)
A lil somethin somethin
On that slow jam tip

[Girl]
You're the one you're the one (and it goes a lil somethin like this)
So let's take a cruise somewhere
You and me

[Mr. Capone-E]
Come on, just cruise with me all night long
as I sing this slow song
baby lets get it on
because it times been wasted
sittin in the park hopin that you not taken
but still thinkin I can have you when I want you
remember that day when I first hugged and kissed you
met you at the barbecue wit tha thick ol' thighs
pretty long hair wit your almond brown suga eyes
got me hypnotized
startin somethin sweet
this relationship partnership is all we need
proceed through the streets as we straight up coastin wit tha sun roof down
baby stay close and never leave my presence and lets keep it true
you're the one fore me and I'm the one for you

[Chorus]
You're the one for me (That's Right baby)
I'm the one for you (You and me Baby)
You're the one for me (Come on Baby)
So lets take a cruise
You're the one for me (that's right baby)
I'm the one for you (You and me baby)
You're the one you're the one (come on baby)
So lets take a cruise
somewhere (that's Right)
you and me (feel me)

[Mr. Capone-E]
Back again, you and me
as I continue this journey
baby I'm for real still me heart in a hurry
early in the morning as I wake up to this tune
while I'm thinkin about you (while I'm thinkin bout you too)
baby girl lets take a cruise as I hit the beach
rub your body down, below the ocean as I start to reach
kiss you and then as I hold you in my arms (you know that I love you john)
I keep it strong Â but my feelings always ran deep
ever since jr. high it was just you and me (you and me)
swept you off your feet cause we got nothing to lose (you and me lets take a cruise)
(ooohhhhhhh, Baby baby baby baby)

[Chorus]

(just you and me)

[Mr. Capone-E]
That's right baby lets take a cruise
all night long
nothin can stop us
with you by my side on this long journey long ride
where the sun shines till eternity (an eternity)
baby I'm for real Mr. Capone-E (Mr. Capone-E)
Lets take a cruise, you feel me
(I feel you too) Cause I feel you (I feel you too)

(You and me) x4

(baby I know when we cruise together) x3

(just you and me... just you and me) </pre>
