My girl be acting like I'm cheating on her with the music
She claimed she caught me flirting so I challenged her to prove it
She say she notice subtle differences on how I'm moving when I'm with her
But nigga that sound to me like I ain't do shit
check the scene me in the lab after dinner with a toothpick
Biting off cigar tips contemplating Goose sips
Dinner was at Ruth's Chris
But it was too bitch and now I feel like being ruthless
She wanna watch a movie
I don't wanna watch it, sue me
My man done copped a oohwee and he coming thru to do beats
When the samples triggered she jealous of the way I'm dancing with it
She just envious of the zone that I entered but
Music sparks the party in the summer starts the calm in the fall
And the way she so aggressive in the winter
What brings me to the center, she who sings to me's the winner
Late nights asking God for a miracle, he sent her
My lady helped me see it
That music is needed to set the freeing of my being
She's dispensable I meet another like her
Who's equivalent to music?
Like the stripes on a tiger there is none
Dogg Pound told me it ain't no fun if the homies can't have none
And her, I can share
I watched my woman pack her bags and do her hair
I think she said she getting out of here
I couldn't hear with the music playing</pre>
