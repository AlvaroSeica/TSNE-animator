[Intro]
FNF

[Chorus]x2

Hello darkness, hello sunshine, hello not at all, hello all he time
Hello no where, hello oblivion, hello goodbye

Hello Darkness
You [x6]

[Verse 1]
All in together the weather is better than ever
I hope it never ends I hope it lasts forever
But when it does, we can all pretend that it's better than it's ever bin
Lie to ourselves like the sky to rebel
And its well and its fine and its fine if it fell
And you couldn't find the story line if you survive to retell
We are targets, Hello darkness

[Chorus]
Hello darkness, hello sunshine, hello not at all, hello all he time
Hello no where, hello oblivion, hello goodbye

[Lupe mumbling]
Said everything is going to be fine
Said everything is gunna be ok
Said just don't breathe the air

[Verse 2]
He just sits and waits for them to kick in the door
He once was a hero they don't love him no more	
There's a blast, every time a foot hits the floor
His gift for not fighting another man's war
And if they can get their hands on the mask that he wore
On his face, they can put somebody else in his place and restore
The state, the illusion that its safe
The state, that being a slave is great
As gas fills the room and rockets destroy everything around him
He stands to find himself surround
By thousands of soldiers that his once trained to never miss their targets
Heartless, Hello Darkness

[Chorus]
Hello darkness, hello sunshine, hello not at all, hello all he time
Hello no where, hello oblivion, hello goodbye

[Outro] Unkle
Hello Darkness

Please to make your acquaintance
Salutations, Kanechiwa
Hello end of the world, how are you, I do fine

[Chorus]x2
Hello darkness, hello sunshine, hello not at all, hello all he time
Hello no where, hello oblivion, hello goodbye

Hey there darkness, hey there sunshine, hello not at all, hello all he time
Hello no where, hello oblivion, hello goodbye

Hello darkness, Hello sunshine
Definite, uncool</pre>
