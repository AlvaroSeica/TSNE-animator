[Verse 1]
(Suffa)
I make tracks for the, certified
For the, b-boys
For the, disempowered
For the, unemployed
For the, worried mothers counting groceries
For my friends, my family, people who are close to me
And if your close to me, I'm loyal to the end
Cos I'm too bad with names to make new friends and
I'm too opinionated to keep my mouth shut
I'm a turn the world upside down and put the south up
On top of this we rockin' this cos I ain't got nothin' else
and it helps when I see the city sufferin'
I'm rupturing lyrics, haemorraghing tracks, bleedin'
out my personality all over the wax
So dj's get your fingers deep in my haemoglobin
Call me safe breaker from the way I always get ya open
Suffa MC get down with ya sufferin' self
I make tracks cos I ain't got nothin' else

[Chorus] {#1}
It's like this, it's like that
And a, (Crossbread)
Riding under one banner
It's like this, it's like that
And a, (my man Chaunders)
Riding under one banner
It's like this, it's like that
And a, (After Hours)
Riding under one banner
It's like this...

[Verse 2]
(Suffa)
Hip hop and cigarettes fill my day
Pour my worries in a cup and watch them spill away
I feel today is just yesterday waiting to happen
That's why I have no patience with my rappin'
Gotta get these tracks writ, rehearse em' til' their tight
Make beats all day, record the verses through the night
I make tracks for kids in bedrooms and hotels, apartments
In cars with their partners and motels
In campervans, caravans, combi-vans, cruise ships
Make tracks for my brothers who taught me to love music
Make tracks for kids in the sub-terrainean
I even make tracks for Yanks who love Australian's
Make tracks for girls in the Mediterranean
Who sit by the window singin' "here comes the rain again"
I make tracks for the love, for myself
I make tracks cos I ain't got nothin' else

[Chorus] {#2}
It's like this, it's like that
And a, (Funkoars)
Riding under one banner
It's like this, it's like that
And a, (my man Blockades)
Riding under one banner
It's like this, it's like that
And a, (Expressionist)
Riding under one banner
It's like this...

We do it like this
It's like that
And a, (Terrafirma)
Riding under one banner
It's like this, it's like that
And a, (my man Collapse)
Riding under one banner
It's like this, it's like that
And a, (Certified Rights)
Riding under one banner
It's like that...</pre>
