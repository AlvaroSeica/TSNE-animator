[Chorus: x2]
Bitches and cars, in there came the fuzz
Hopin out my Lac girl, mama pop some large
Throw it in the bag
And my money last, hunned in the cash
Some give the bomb draws, Throw it in the bag
Throw it in the bag
And my money last, hunned in the cash
Some give the bomb draws, Throw it in the bag
Throw it in the bag
Bitches and cars, in there came the fuzz
Love to do it, yea, come on let's pop some cash
Throw it in the bag

[Verse 1]
Whip, whip, whippin out the lead
Whip, whip, whippin out the wheel
Bitch I've been a problem
Bitch I've been the pilot
Talk of my girl, fight it
Medusa on my body
Garage like a dealer, '02 Reggie Miller
They climbin the squash but we come in the killer
She bust it wide open then she pop the pill
And make that root disappear, David Copperfield
Sippin on that lean, I be sippin on that 'Roc
I be stuntin on them ends
I came straight off that black
And I pull up in that muzine
All real like I'm new damn
All my jewelry bluey, fuck boy it's a new day

[Chorus]
Bitches and cars, in there came the fuzz
Hopin out my Lac girl, mama pop some large
Throw it in the bag
And my money last, hunned in the cash
Some give the bomb draws, Throw it in the bag
Throw it in the bag
And my money last, hunned in the cash
Some give the bomb draws, Throw it in the bag
Throw it in the bag
Bitches and cars, in there came the fuzz
Love to do it, yea, come on let's pop some cash
Throw it in the bag

[Verse 2]
That game, I rap don't play
Came up, I roll like Jada
Hunned deep how we came in
Doing sounds like we masons
Hold his head, ain't no haven
Coke boy, yes I'm they favorite
Snatch the ground from under your feet, I'm removing the pavement
Headshot, that Rari bring the same crib, Saddam Hussein
The blood diamonds all in my bracelet, fuck you and them hoes you came with
Snatch a fish out the water,
Came the cam of recorder
Yellow rope for my haters
Purple drink, we the Lakers
Know we keep it tweezy on the scale there
Smoke weed nigga like some bad shit, I could tell fair
Freshest one since Bel Air, look what I smell here
Pussy on these niggaz,
Enough with that snow, bitch she just left here
Throw it in the bag

[Chorus]
Bitches and cars, in there came the fuzz
Hopin out my Lac girl, mama pop some large
Throw it in the bag
And my money last, hunned in the cash
Some give the bomb draws, Throw it in the bag
Throw it in the bag
And my money last, hunned in the cash
Some give the bomb draws, Throw it in the bag
Throw it in the bag
Bitches and cars, in there came the fuzz
Love to do it, yea, come on let's pop some cash
Throw it in the bag

[Verse 3]
Gotta keep it 100
Cal D, spend 100
Really all them hoes, told er give me head with her hammy
Money all I hear, bitch all in my ear
Can't you see I'm high? California
10 on them hoes, kidnap yo bitch and put blacks in her dough
Black man marauder nigga
But you playin them hoes, pipe plane to that rover
Cocaine, Kurt Cobain, Shawty playin with her nose
That facts life I chose, fast cars we drove
Bad hoes that bad froze
Papers down and go
Tip toeing that money, I stack 6 floors of them hunneds
I got 6 stores of that money
Hah, coke boys  we run it
Montana!

[Chorus]
Bitches and cars, in there came the fuzz
Hopin out my Lac girl, mama pop some large
Throw it in the bag
And my money last, hunned in the cash
Some give the bomb draws, Throw it in the bag
Throw it in the bag
And my money last, hunned in the cash
Some give the bomb draws, Throw it in the bag
Throw it in the bag
Bitches and cars, in there came the fuzz
Love to do it, yea, come on let's pop some cash
Throw it in the bag

[Bridge]
Tell them hoes I holler, stack I got em
Fuck you, pay me  that's my motto
Tell them hoes I holler, stack I got em
Fuck you, pay me  that's my motto

[Chorus]
Bitches and cars, in there came the fuzz
Hopin out my Lac girl, mama pop some large
Throw it in the bag
And my money last, hunned in the cash
Some give the bomb draws, Throw it in the bag
Throw it in the bag
And my money last, hunned in the cash
Some give the bomb draws, Throw it in the bag
Throw it in the bag
Bitches and cars, in there came the fuzz
Love to do it, yea, come on let's pop some cash
Throw it in the bag</pre>
