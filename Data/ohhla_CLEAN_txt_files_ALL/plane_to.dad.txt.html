You need to drop on down to P.R.

I'm your idol, your highest title, numero uno
yes I'm puerto rican, but I'm speaking so that you know ma'y
Arroz con avichielas siempre you know ma'y
Los que se tiran la tela fina you know ma'y

Welcome to mi casa dame laza
Donde las mujeres son una amenaza
La comba del reggueton y la salsa
Chaba con mi musica haber lo que pasa
In your eyes I can see lo que les viene and it happens every daaay
Cus I'm young and I'm brand and I thought this way
they might think I'm Carlito's Way ....man give me a break

Dont try to push me cus I feel this way, (no te calles dile)
If you dont feel me yo se los dire (c'mon)

I'm gonna hope on a plane to P.R.

Up in the house

Shakin their ass

Take me down to P.R.
Where the senoritas are
I can speak a lil spanish tu como esta
Mami quieres bailar dime lo que quieres
I got a lil fetish to be dancing with mujeres
Will.i.am chop up the funk like the shredders
When I'm done rocking they be like hay me jefe
Black man raised in the hood with the ese
Mami tiene que pensar be like dame el ese
Dame, dame, dame, mami, mami, mami porfavor
Por que esta cancion es un reggueton
Daddy yankke, will.i.am collaboration on
From P.R. to east los rocking on and on
Aprende mi gente negros, cafe we fighting one another
And I'm asking porque'
Cus latins like blacks, and blacks like latins
Lets stop fighting, start off and whats happening.

I'm gonna hope on a plane to P.R.
I'm gonna hope on a plane to P.R.
They got hot lil mamacitas

You need to drop on down to P.R.
