Behold a pale horse
on a failed course to derail the source
Inhale the worst of the worlds pain exhale a fourth
Jail enforced on the mind of the the stale and short
Slash with swords Mandible claws
and hand me rewards
Damage with hordes adored and the ignored
Fantasy laws protect the haves
and abandon the core
Champion cause pay the applause savor the flaws
Sip the courvas-ier and play god behind bars
Of blood thirsty villages pillaging
Synonym to holy books and images killing em
Women and children in the the buildings
With locked doors
and fire spread from the floor
up to the ceiling
This is war
Zen against the now against the then
With the Dao and everything we won't allow
Revenge and the power of the pen and a vow
Avenge defend what they intend to defile
We ascend heavenly readily and smile
The energy is foul
The remedy is here
The penalty is why
The enemy is how
Take ten of these and howl at the moon
To the tune of the zhao
Decaying, greying
obeying the things they're saying
Staying the same
hating the images their portraying
Fading into the ocean of noise
devoted groping for poise
Employed by moments of joy
and memories that destroy
Boys taught to be caught
to be lost what's the cost
Pay the boss stay the course take a loss
Sip the sauce get divorced
feel remorse double crossed
Never shocked puff a rock
take a walk pray for the future to stop

Prejudice, crack shit
feeding the creature of habit
Turning tragic, graphic
when the teacher is systematic
they call it classic automatic
then bow to the Fascists
Capital rackets marketing phones
flasks and tablets
Basking in the fat of addicts
entertainment and magic
Pulling rabbits out of caskets
when the facts are plastic
Enthusiastic drink the poisonous packet
Mix bottled water and ashes
and laugh motherfuck the masses
That's what cash is: a distraction
Replace your passion
with a need for the fashion
adapting with no reaction
Slave to the contraption
made to close your caption
Crashing stock market
represented in the taxes
Make us confuse what the lies and the facts is
Fuck an asset, all you can do with that shit
Is buy obsession to forget everything that is
Mall shooting all consuming
innocence never proven
Acting clueless
searching for the newest most elusive
A broken rubix cube
and no concept of where the roof is
Know where the noose is
seduced by cupid and excuses
SUV covered in flags and a crucifix
Tags of liberal lucifer and all his collusion
Fuck debate and conclusion
embrace faith and illusions
Fate confusion political hate and exclusion
Pollution based on cake
and all the useless abuses
you need to fuse it in your movements
And keep yourself secluded
The wealth is foolish
just a game a muse for your amusement
Whatever fix you're choosing
It's only strange if you think of all the pain
that makes you need what's soothing
To take you from your losing
Taste the fluid and create the music
Relate to ruin till it's too late to keep it moving</pre>
