Scratches, "Hot Damn, Yo, Here we go again"(MC Lyte)

{Wise Intelligent}
The beneficent
Teacher, Wise Intelligent
Tell me teacher where you been?
Make a way for me to go for mine!
Like Barry White in the Secret Garden
Am I gonna rock em? Pardon?
Sho' you right!! (Wise &amp; C-Free)
Might go, stumble in a disco
No blunts! No stunts! And I'm anti-cisco!
Now feeling a Heineken
Wise about to shine again
This is total five per-cent business!
Say!  Can I get some time?
To rock a rhyme, hope so
Heal the deaf, the dumb, the blind, Yes! Yo
Strictly ghetto noise is what I'm talking about!
And PRT p-osse come to file it out!
I'll drop this, sissies try to top this
Why don't they stop this?
Madness!
Girls the girls
With attitude
Till they come to get lick down
By the sound of a soul!
Rolling, teacher soul controlling
Shaheed on the tunes and flares
Kicks and snares high hats
Culture and the Wise rap
Teachers dealt the format 
Cuzz, blacks got to have that
Watch close, PRT, we be the most
Can I say I raise a toast?
To our dopeness
Boy, follow we
They beg us do the knowledge g?
This be such a sight to see
It's PRT once more

{DJ Shaheed - scratching}
"Yeah y'all c'mon, Here we go again!" (Public Enemy) 4x
"Here we go, Here we go, Here we, Here we, Here we go! (Run DMC) 4x

{Wise Intelligent}
Here I go Shaheed
Now could  you slow this up?
Culture check one two 
While I blow shit up!
A one two, a one two (Culture Freedom)
Now watch me cuss
PRT be dangerous
And we always was
I am a danger
I gotcha head banger
Lyrically I'll hang ya'
Because I'm ten times tough
Yet I'm your teacher
So I choose to teach ya'
This a double feature
Me and the kids I crush
I just layback
Never let no pussy catch
Me with no poison
Cuzz I'm King!
See 
They wouldn't catch me wit there poison (Wise and Culture)
????????????????????
See me, I am the voice of the pro
C-Free, we PRT
Yo they know
And that's a fact aayy!!
We are leaders of the pack
And that's a fact say!!
This ghetto thing is all of that
After serving  justice you could learn from Wise
People of the world know we deserve the prize
Watch close, PRT, we be the most
Can I say I raise a toast?
To my dopeness
Boy, follow we
They beg us do the knowledge g?
This be such a sight to see
It's PRT once more

{Culture Freedom}
Mr. Culture Freedom with the crazy ill style
Making everybody want to get buckwild!
Hitting all the suckers like boom, bang, pow!
When you see me coming don't laugh or smile!
Switching up the flav
Cuzz I know I could do it
Write the funky raps
Then I run right through it
Some get ill
And might want to boo it
But no matter whatever 
The Culture Freedom sticks to it
Some don't know
So yo got to flow
Smash up sets
Then quick out the door
Getting mo' money, mo' money, mo',mo'
THAT'S HOW IT IS WHEN YOUR'E A HIPHOP HO!

{Wise Intelligent}
Ya'll in
Teacher watcha talking
Tell em where the Gods been
NEW JERSEY DRIVIN'!!! (All say)
Watch it PRT
Cuzz I'm in
A triple stage of blackness
That describes the mind state,
Triple soul, and black skin
Ex-slave runaway
Still we having fun today
Burning down the master's house
Have to describe the thing we say 
AAAYYY!
Father Shaheed rumpin' pumpin' 
My system
Wise and Culture Freedom come to have some fun
?????? Business booming
PRT blackness
Never cartooning
????? Sitcom
Pussy clots get bombed
Here the teacher command
Once Again (All say)
In time I
Feel that I'm a get mine
Cuzz I'm a youth size
Struggler, I and I kick this
Devil try to trick this
The ghetto's slickest
Hustlers! Yo!
Watch close, PRT, we be the most

To our dopeness
Boy, follow we
They beg us do the knowledge g?
This be such a sight to see
