[Intro: Chris Brown]
Turn my fuckin beat up!!!! Turn my fuckin beat up!!!!
Turn my fuckin beat up!!!! Sak Pase!!!

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Uh! Yeah! We can do anything
Walk into anywhere and buy anything
I be chillin I ain't worried 'bout anything
Why stop now I can have everything!!!!
Yeah!!! Yeah!!!  I can have everything!!!!
Yeah!!! Yeah!!! I can have everything!!!!
Yeah!!! Yeah!!! I can have everything!!!!
Why stop now I can have everything!!!!

[Verse One: Busta Rhymes]
(Now) Everytime single time I get up in the buildin and I touch it
And I get it poppin you could never stop it and I love it
Got 'em buggin and they wonderin how a nigga does it
When I blacken every hood in every street and I flood it
Makin every Dj wanna bring it back and then they run it
Make another nigga starve ain't no food up in they cabinet
See the way I got 'em scared now I got a nigga runnin
From the way that I be gettin on a beat and I be dumbin
(..Shit! I wanna see y'all do that on Youtube!)
Let me dibble and a dabble with the flow 
And let me show you niggas how I really mix it up (YEP!)
I'm a slow it down a little, nah think I better maybe switch it up (KILL 'EM!)
Switch it up and probably pitch it up
I wanna see your bottles in your hands nigga get it up 
(HO!) Throw the money all around until it hit the ground
make a shorty wiggle before she pick it up
(WOO!) You know the shit was kind of dead
'fore I had to step up all in the spot and really lift it up
(DAMN!) As soon as a bust a nigga head in
and then throw a little coke up in the streets until they sniff it up
{*Sniffles} And see they know that when I come I hit it up
I kill it 'til a nigga 'bout to get the steppin up
You need to better know that I could do anything that I want
niggas already be known when I'm a give it up!

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Yeah! We can do anything
Walk into anywhere and buy anything
I be chillin I ain't worried 'bout anything
Why stop now I can have everything!!!!
Yeah!!! Yeah!!! I can have everything!!!!
Yeah!!! Yeah!!! I can have everything!!!!
Yeah!!! Yeah!!! I can have everything!!!!
Why stop now I can have everything!!!!

[Interlude: Busta Rhymes]
Alright! I'm a let you niggas calm down for a minute and get y'all shit together
This what I need y'all to do.........
CLAP! CLAP! CLAP! CLAP! CLAP! LET'S GO!!!!

[Verse Two: Busta Rhymes]
Ok! Come around see me put it down just a little bit
Ball when I'm heavy y'all already know exactly what they do
somebody better get the crown when a nigga spit
(HURRY!) Make sure you polish a little 'fore you bring it to me
while I lock it down with another hit
(HERE ALREADY) And you ain't even gotta ask
and you already know another banger is what your gonna get
(YEAH!) Better bounce when when a nigga say so
it's like magic when a nigga spit presto (HA!)
And if your really with me and you ready let's go (HUH!)
Ride with a nigga like we on the Metro (OH!)
Y'all already know I'll kill anyone, anywhere, anything from the very intro
And I (BE THE MOST EVERYTHING!) And ya should have knew that from the very get go

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Yeah! We can do anything
Walk into anywhere and buy anything
I be chillin I ain't worried 'bout anything
Why stop now I can have everything!!!!
Yeah!!! Yeah!!! I can have everything!!!!
Yeah!!! Yeah!!! I can have everything!!!!
Yeah!!! Yeah!!! I can have everything!!!!
Why stop now I can have everything!!!!

[Verse Three: Busta Rhymes]
[GO!) Just watch 'em closely how they bug on how the God delivers
Now we blacken in this bitch until the police come and get us
(WATCH AND YOU CAN SEE IT'S THE CONGLOMERATE!) Who's fuckin with us!
I could shit and fart all on the beat and kill a couple niggas
(OH!) A he-he-he-he-he..Everybody know what the fuck it is (TRUE!)
And then I bang 'em and I beat 'em in the head
niggas know I do it 'til I split a couple wigs (BONG!)
And you know that when I got 'em and I hit it from the bottom
you don't want a nigga really though
And I be doin anything that I want it
don't matter where we at I'm a LET IT GO!!!!

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Yeah! We can do anything
Walk into anywhere and buy anything
I be chillin I ain't worried 'bout anything
Why stop now I can have everything!!!!
Yeah!!! Yeah!!! I can have everything!!!!
Yeah!!! Yeah!!! I can have everything!!!!
Yeah!!! Yeah!!! I can have everything!!!!
Why stop now I can have everything!!!!

[Outro: Busta Rhymes]
