[Intro]
Love song...
Love song...
Ha-haaah! 9th Wonder

[Chorus: Mac Miller] (Heather Victoria)
C'mon, it ain't cool to make a love song (Ohh)
They lookin at me like there's somethin wrong (Inside, it's love)
They sing a song about cars and drugs (with me)
Even gangsta muh'fuckers fall in love
C'mon, it ain't cool to make a love song (Ohh)
They lookin at me like there's somethin wrong (Inside, it's love)
They sing a song about cars and drugs
Even gangsta muh'fuckers fall in love

[Mac Miller]
I got a girl who always trippin on these bitches 
who keep tryin to come and holla
I don't bother with these groupies who just wanna chase the dollar
My everything, I got her, platinum and copper
We gon' stay together 'til one of us use a walker (ha-haah!)
She popular but I got her first
I tried, she denied, so I got to work
I gotta let her know the way her smile tend to glow
and the time we took that molly, that shit had us on a roll
I disconnect the cordless, feelin all distorted
Bored with this mortage, bored of all that whore shit
I bet she never thought I'd have her fall in love
Beauty or brain, maybe she all of the above

[Chorus]

[Mac Miller]
I know that everytime I do somethin wrong
I can'ts get away with it by makin a song
Gettin thru the fights though is takin too long
But if it's what you wanna do, then I'm playin along
Cause I know you love me though, so I love you back (back, back)
And some shit I do is fuckin wack (wack, wack)
But you don't care about the hundred stacks, shit
You just want ya fuckin bubby back
But I'm somewhere far, way out on a tour
Livin it large, it's everything and more
My dream come true, store the problem with you
You want me at home, but I'm all in the move
When I'm back at the crib, we gon' go on a cruise
My alarm goes off, I'ma reach for the snooze
Nothing to say, but so much to do
The second that we met, I was fallin for you, heh

[Chorus]

[Outro: Mac Miller] (Heather Victoria)
Like that, like that, hehe yeah
Uh, it's The Wonder Years (Inside, it's love)
Man, 9th, shout out 9th one time, man (with me)
Ni', 9th tellin me to treat a woman with respect
You knahmsayin, I'm tryna be a gentleman out here with these girls
Too many muh'fuckers, just think they 
can tell a bitch to pull her titties out
And I'm like, "HOLD UP, BITCH!! I'm a gentleman
I'ma buy ya food and, then you pull your tittles out"
HAHAHAHAHAHA~! Dem titties...
Yah! (Even gangsta muh'fuckers fall in love)
9th Wonder, that's my bro man
That's a big homie, YEE-aaah
Germ's recordin it, it's not Germ's beat
It's 9th's beat, but Germ's recording it
And he likes when I shout him out, cause he's a bitch
(Even gangsta muh'fuckers fall in love)
Uh-huh, "The Wonder Years", BE-YOTCH!</pre>
