[Redman]
You motherfuckers gotta get...
Live baby [16X]

[Khari Santiago]
Introduction, Khari makes you wet like 90 degrees
Summer night of passionate raw fuckin
Physical frame slim, you mention my name in
Your verse and you might be leaving the earth flamin
Shit changed when I came in, niggas stopped smilin
Started hatin and wishin my chest would get caved in
Oh why? Probably cuz I'm too much to clutch too fly
Cats dividin findin cuts to hide in
Scared like a bunch of little skirts, it gets worse
Or gettin their delicate feelings hurt
Or run around, chain danglin, grippin their nuts
Big balla nigga til you slip and get stuck
And I, trunk cake the break, break fools that take schools
Of emcees get sprayed through so bad it'll make news
Reported that you got slaughtered the only description
You got ripped by some tall kid that like an Egyptian

[Redman]2X
Yo, we want y'all to liven it up
Before I do
We want y'all to get fucked up
Before I do
We want y'all to get the money
Before I do
We want y'all to get high, high, high
Before I do

[Onasis]
Yeah live it up now before I do
Wit my new millenium gat, mines is blue
Glock and clip, cock it back, lost your chips
Smart bullet, and marked your name before I pull it
Hip hop the shit, it run through my blood
Fake thug, I aint dirt, you ran through mud
I'm what rap was, and what it be
The lyrical, mystical, live MC
Ay you rap subliminal
Rock hard shit you a mineral
Lab rapper made by chemicals
Me, I'm nice when it comes to material
Like Redman I should have my own cereal
E new sheriff in rap, Reggie hammered it
How the hell you get backstage wit no laminate
Area restricted from those MCs that's not gifted
Amateur night show you missed it

[Redman]2X
We want y'all to liven it up
Before I do
We want y'all to get fucked up
Before we do
We want y'all to get the money
Before I do
We want y'all to get high, high, high
Before we do</pre>
