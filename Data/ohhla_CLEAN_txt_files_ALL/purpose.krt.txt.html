[Big K.R.I.T.]
(I ain't no... simp)
I was born in '86, despite the wolves and rats
Survived the wild and returned with these bear furs on my back
To feed the family, drink the wine, give thanks to God, and watch for signs
The winter's cold but we was chose to rise above the darkened skies
And, fight against what lied beneath, my feet are firmly on the ground
Prepare my soul and grit my teeth, fight or flight, it's goin down
What man amongst me says, that I ain't fit to wear my ather's crown
A King of mine and mine alone, my blood line cain't be renounced
Stand up and be counted for, raise your fist as glory speaks
Heaven's what I'm dyin for, ,I swear the devil's at war with me
I deal with life accordingly one day at a time
And that kingdom we all searchin for, I pray one day we find
So many have long and gone, so many got left behind
But as time travels and Earth unravels, church bells still chime
Planets still align, as angels watch over
I break the chains they gave me and put these medals on my shoulders
Cause I ain't no simp

[Outro: Miya Bailey]
You'll be different
You'll find comfort in family
Your power lies in your faith and beliefs
What's a king without a crown?
Or a kingdom to call his own? This is purpose
