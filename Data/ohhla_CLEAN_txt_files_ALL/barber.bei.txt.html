And now (and now)...
We will get familiar
With the sounds of...
Bei Maejor!

Yo, yo, yo, yo, what's up man?
Y'all I got this crazy story for real
Y'all ain't gon' believe this
What's it about?
Uhh...
I don't know
(What happened?)
Uhh...
(What happened?)
Oh..
(What happened?)
I don't know
(What happened?)
I don't know
Look, this is real talk
I swear it's all true
I'ma to lose my mind
Don't know what to do

I got a little story
Excuse my accent
But listen up
You will not believe what happened
I woke up this mornin'
'Round 10:15
Kinda pissed off
I was havin' good dreams
Went to the kitchen and made some breakfast
Reached for my phone
And I had some texts
One from my sister
Her name's Alexis
One about a show I got-a do in Texas
'Nother one from a lady who knows my baby
I found it quite odd
It was very crazy
Can't tell you how they know each otha
Put it like this...
Look they know each otha
Add on the fact that she's clearly married
And her husband
He is very scary
I heard that one time last January
He shot a man dead tryna talk to Sherry
See Sherry is his wife
That's the one who text me
She send me smiley faces, say she can't forget me
And I could not resist when she tried to tempt me
So we went and had wine 'til her glass was empty
I left out swiftly
'Fore he came home
Next thing I know she blowin' up my phone
Sayin' that she wanna see ya boy later on
I know it ain't right but it don't feel wrong

Uhh... What...
Aye yo Bei Maejor
It seems like you got yourself in a bit of a pickle
But I'm still a bit confused
I still gotta question
What happened?
I don't know
What happened?
I don't know
What happened?
I don't know
What happened?
I don't know
What happened?
I don't know
This is real talk
I swear it's all true
I'ma lose my mind
Don't know what to do

Now the story goes on and on and on and on
She asked am I scared of him and I said naw
(Stop lyin') Straight lied
But I played it off cool
Played it off smooth
Man you know how I do
Remember this lady
She knows my baby
And that is kinda odd
Yup, very crazy
I can't tell you yet how they know each otha
But put it like this
Look they know each otha
Now my real girlfriend keeps callin' callin'
Cryin' on the phone
Straight bawlin' bawlin'
I'm thinkin that she knows what I been doin' all day
False alarm she said the dog ran away
Unh
And I could care less about an animal
Hit the other line it's my homie Shanamo
What's up? Yeah we still goin' hoopin'
Know I'm gon' ball 'cause I'm really good at shootin'
Click back over and said I miss her
Can't wait to see ya I'm dyin' to kiss ya
Some may say I am very trifling
But this new girl she was so exciting
And this next part is quite a shocker
The story gets shakin' up like maracas
So pay attention but excuse my accent
And listen up
You ain't gon' believe what happened

Nah man so...
Just...
Man the story gets so crazy right here
I, I don't think y'all ready
(What happened?)
I don't know
(What happened?)
I don't know
(What happened?)
I don't know
(What happened?)
I don't know
(What happened?)
I don't know
Just, this is real talk
I swear it's all true
Bout to lose my mind
Don't know what to do </pre>
