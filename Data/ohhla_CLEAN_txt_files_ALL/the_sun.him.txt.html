[Chorus]
A prince wince, at the sun
Proclaiming slums as his hustledom
Kingdoms come, kingdoms fall
A man's limit by his ambitions

Peace to the streets that's flooded red with blood
My folks who feel hate, yet invest in love
Peace to the seeds that's planting seeds of peace
Yet acknowledge grief that made our forefathers bleed

A prince wince, at the sun
Proclaiming slums as his hustledom
Kingdoms come, kingdoms fall
A man's limit by his ambitions

[Rainman]
We take stock in the spots we rock
The two smoking barrels, unheralded heros of rap
Here in a flash, when the beat drops, the speech pops and feeds off
The strength of the crowd
We locking it down like bondage flicks
Ray's the James Bond of this
Laughing in the face of ominous times
Maintaining my spine to carry the heavy weight on my mind and shoulders
We getting older and colder, the road to where I wanna goes looking more like a pipe dream
I take tokes and place hope in HP, the entity
Forever endless infinite MCs
We bring peace from entropy
And let the tension  cease and desist
While you reaching for chrys, I'm teaching my fist
To rise in protest, like Tommy Smith in '68
Til the taste of the States discrase dissipates
And we face the facts, or face the wrath  of the human race
Where it never pays to break from the pack, turn around and attack for gas
You can't be serious yeah
This president's got nefarious plans
It's like we put the planet in the hands of shaved apes who hate us
Like Dr. Zaius, I'm here to save us
Players, keep me in your prayers and I'll see you later

[Chorus]
A prince wince, at the sun
Proclaiming slums as his hustledom
Kingdoms come, kingdoms fall
A man's limit by his ambitions

Peace to the streets that's flooded red with blood
My folks who feel hate, yet invest in love
Peace to the seeds that's planting seeds of peace
Yet acknowledge grief that made our forefathers bleed

A prince wince, at the sun
Proclaiming slums as his hustledom
Kingdoms come, kingdoms fall
A man's limit by his ambitions

[Chee Malabar]
I write a rhyme in A-minor get to wailin' like Mahalia
Chee's the alias, Government name: resident alien
My pops said, Chee, lemme tell ya, life's a lesson in failure
Taught by mediocre men who think they are Machiavellian
Poppin' civilians, spittin' missiles at buildings
Killin' the innocent women and children, it's real when
You gotta wield steel in the streets to get yours
They lock you up and call you violent
Join the armed troops to help them get theirs-
You'se an American Patriot, a First Class Private-
Not for nuthin', this war's driven by profits(Prophets)
Our government's in it, for the sake of economics
The Arab world's fightin', to validate Muhammad
Regardless of faith, it's Oil good for certain
There's money to be made in death and destruction
Vice President Cheney ran Haliburton
And guess who was awarded the coveted contract
To fight oil field fires set off in Iraq
And fuck Jacques Chirac, he don't care if they die
He's upset, the French can't get a piece of the pie
The real billions lie in Iraq's reconstruction
After the war to fix the infrastructure
Freedom is an afterthought, fucker this is a business venture

[Chorus]
A prince wince, at the sun
Proclaiming slums as his hustledom
Kingdoms come, kingdoms fall
A man's limit by his ambitions

Peace to the streets that's flooded red with blood
My folks who feel hate, yet invest in love
Peace to the seeds that's planting seeds of peace
Yet acknowledge grief that made our forefathers bleed

A prince wince, at the sun
Proclaiming slums as his hustledom
Kingdoms come, kingdoms fall
A man's limit by his ambitions

People we seeking to find, the reason we grind
We arrived, to see if freedoms alive
And now we seizing our time to shine
You gotta reach to climb
Conquer the summit achieve peace of mind... (3x)</pre>
