[Chorus: unknown singer]
I've been goin through so much pain
Can't no motherfucker feel my pain
My life is real nigga, I'm gon' ride
For my homies on the block that died
It's dedicated to my niggaz that's locked
Who's OT on the run from the cops
We straight G's and we never gon' stop
For my street niggaz gotta keep your head up
Gotta keep your head uuuuuuuuuup

[Verse One]
Where the fuck is your love, y'all in the club poppin bub
Somebody told me that the block need a hug
Ain't nobody tell y'all that slap need a hug
That's the reason I'm out here huggin the block
Same reason I'm out here thuggin the block
But niggaz won't notice until a motherfucker get shot
And stretched out on the block, and the shit won't hit 'em
'til they like "God damn, I was just now with him"
Now you missin a man that you used to call your man
Cause you didn't notice your man was fucked up in a jam
And your plan that you had for your man, you shoulda brought it to him sooner
Now he fucked up with his back all chewed up
21 gun salute up, to all the G's feelin pain
like Fame; niggaz fucked up in the game
Niggaz try to maintain, even if nobody showed you
that they noticin what a nigga been goin through... nigga

[Chorus]

[Billy Danze]
Yeah, every day what we deal, we tend to blame it on the realness
Haters never cater to a 'Ville nigga feeling
Mixed up in the past and the present
A lot of shit, went down in the town am I destined, to win or not
That's the question, you can always count on Bill
to reveal the message, when givin a confession
In other words there's a blessing in the lesson
You ain't gotta stick to the script to catch it (catch it)
We had a whole platoon of goons to rep
Then it was like... BOOM, there's 7 of us left
Some got knocked and locked inside cages
A few got popped and stopped at young ages
Enables me to rock hip-hop with these rages
And boomerang pain through Fame when on stages
It's dark and it's bold
I keep a heater cause I'm smart and it's cold

[Chorus]

[Lil' Fame]
I'm holdin on to thin air! (Look around homey)
Nobody there! (Look around homey)
Nobody care! (I bet you know now homey)
But life is still beautiful, that's what you do it for
Couldn't feel my pain; God forbid you had
to feel my pain I wouldn't wish that on nobody
Never ask why me?  That's a stupid-ass question
Cause if not me, nigga then who?
We all deal with pain, and mine ain't no harder than yours
It's really all about how you deal with it
So a nigga can't judge me; I can't tell you how
to deal with yours, but don't kill me {*words fade*}

[Billy Danze]
(We're amongst these O.G.'s and rebels) the coppertops will (never)
If money war (we steppin in) please (understand it)
For always we (reppin it) and y'all ain't (touchin it)
The ghetto steel (blessin 'em) man
