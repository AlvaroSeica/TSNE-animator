[Verse 1: Peter Gunz]
I'm New York to the heart, but got love for all
Lie and die in the fire, where I learned to ball
Uptown is the place where I lay my dome
On the streets of the Bronx where my family roam
Oh damnit, we home
Peter got a dime
Playa haters can feel the flame from my [{*heater*}]
I never really liked to play a fool like that
But I love to succeed to see foes fall flat
Splat
Like Deja Vu
And I got another rhyme that'll daze y'all crew
I sip Cristal, Dom P, Mo' in the crystal
Just cause I'm tipsy don't mean you should misdoubt
Peep 'em in the fifties, and
Hundreds all arranged
Anything less than that
You keep the change
Not filthy rich, but trick, I'm barely broke
Blessed with flows that keep you hooked like [{*dope*}]
Friends call me Gunz
Some call me trife
Cause I'm quick to slide off and slide this game to your wife
And that's life
You should learn how to treat her
Guarantee Peter
Knows how to greet her and meet her
People in the Bronx call me Lex
Cause I push a Lex, and I rock a Rolex
And I lounge on Lex'
And I love sex
And you know I step on jacks that be tryin' to flex
Like Dex
Money, God, rest your soul
But when you playin' cards for Gunz, ain't time to fold, ho!

Chorus: Peter Gunz
New York, New, got crazy game
But out-of-town (???) all the same
Brooklyn, Brook, get crazy loot
That's because when it's beef, they ain't scared to [{*shoot*}]
Harlem, Harl', know how to play
Mack the 600, gettin' crazy pay
[{*Niggaz*}] outta Queens got [{*shit*}] on lock
[{*Strapped*}] with the [{*glock*}], runnin' up in your spot

[Tariq] But if it wasn't for the Bronx, this rap [{*shit*}] probably never
        Would be going on, so tell me where you from
[Peter] Uptown baby
        Uptown baby
        We gets down baby
        I'm for the crown baby
[Tariq] Now, if it wasn't for the Bronx, this rap [{*shit*}] probably never
        Would be going on, so tell me where you from
[Peter] Uptown baby
        Uptown baby
        We gets down baby
        I'm for the crown baby

[Verse 2: Lord Tariq]
The RM-80
Is parked in the lot
Right next to the Mercedes
I keep the thing ready
For these blocks that are shady
You crazy if you walk around
Thinkin' life's gravy, now, stop me (Maybe)
I'm livin' life lawless
Makin' big investments
On an H class flawless, and girls call us
I'm comfortable like Ricarro
Two quarters of my life
Walkin' roads tight, narrow
And the thoughts that I abide by
That stride my mind, got my mind's eye
Points sharper
Than an arrow, flyin' high, keep your eye on the sparrow
Riches like the pharoahe
Bought a new five
With the snitches for these [{*hoes*}]
Trunk full of [{*ammo*}]
I keep my dawgs closer than most players keep they own shadow
When I rap for my foes like I battle
I rock stones
While you bugs rock gravel
You talk trap
Whatever have you
I'm from Soundview
Bronx most wanted
Front, get confronted
Player, we rollin' deep in the one point five hundreds
It's like Big I, we ride, and if you want it
You step outside and get [{*blooded*}], I'll have your whole block flooded
With the Bronx, it's a warning, storm in, let it out
From
Dusk Til Dawn, and it's on, no doubt
Keep a eye on your chick when I'm roamin' about
And put a eye on your lip, player
Watch your mouth
I'm from the Bronx, wipe your feet when you step in my house
Cause you'se a small time figure, 'bout a half an ounce
Now

Repeat Chorus

[Tariq] But if it wasn't for the Bronx, this rap [{*shit*}] probably never
        Would be going on, so tell me where you from
[Peter] Uptown baby
        Uptown baby
        We gets down baby
        I'm for the crown baby</pre>
