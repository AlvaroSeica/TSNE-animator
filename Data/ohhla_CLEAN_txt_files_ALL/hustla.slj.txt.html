Typed by: kingjoflash@yahoo.com

Thats what I'm talking about
Show you niggas the fucking definition of a hustla
Street hustling, rap hustling, ya know
Fuck what you talking about, years later

(Chorus x2)
I'ma a motherfucking hustla, a motherfucking hustla
H-U-S-T-L-E-R
I'm hustling, I ain't gon hurt for nothing
I'ma keep on serving

(Soulja Slim)
I got what you want dog
I got some ounces of that raw
And I don't serve bunkin that's law
If I get a bad package of it
I'ma make the bags flooded
All the dope snorters gon love it
Put a five on the twenty eight
Just so my client could accumulate
Grab me handful pass out samples
Nigga shoot or O.D.
Hit him with a hot shot
That nigga owe me die slowly
Thats the shit they really want
I was a dope snorta at one time 
Use to jack a nigga try to sell me bunk
Take ya motherfucking lick I'm sick
I ain't get loaded in seven years I kick
But this ain't about my dope fiend days
It's about hustling getting paid
Never could see me working minimum wage
I'm from where niggas killing with k's no mercy
Its kill or be killed I'ma hurt you before you hurt me

(Chorus x2)

(soulja Slim)
See I can take twenty g's and make twenty mo twenty g's with that
Dope game or rap
I got a million dollar hustle scheme
If I ain't in the studio, I'm working the triple beam
Nigga you ain't know, I don't nothing else but hustling
Other niggas fall flat down on they face but motherfuck them
I got me, wild magnolia thats where my shop be
Close down willow st, move it on magnolia st
Cause sarg be all on a nigga dick like pussy juice
So the only thing I do is pick up when I come through
Whats up when I come thru, niggas hollerin awww
I show love like none niggas flaggin down my car
I'ma street nigga the streets love me and they made me
I'm the other hustla besides master p and baby
Down here ima spit that shit you wanna hear
Watch out cuthroat records clock some millions this year

(chorus x2)

(soulja Slim)
Ain't no motherfucking limit you must dig it
With you or without you I'ma get my meal ticket
Fuck a nigga holding me back I'm gon get it
Cutthroat a few niggas just to represent my city
They got ya'll thinking its sweet but its shitty
Nigga hustling trying to put they rides on twenties
You sip crystal right now I'm sipping henny
You won't see me do bad can't throw a hustla a penny
Its yours you made it spend it how you spend it
But yo bitch ass gon feel me when I finish
I want all my niggas to listen to me and feel this
Nigga talking that shit but soulja slim is the realest
I'm bout slanging that iron behind some fucked up business
If its mines then I want it 
I'll get it in blood
Behind benjamin franklin soulja will throw slugs

(Chorus x3)</pre>
