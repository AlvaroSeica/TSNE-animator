[Chorus 2X: Kiss sample]
Only you, are the answer
You turn the night into day, yeah

[Solomon Childs]
Welcome the city of bloods, Katrina floods, mafia hugs
Home Depot rugs, Isotoner rubber grip gloves
The stickiest dubs, gangsta music
Light the drugs, bullets the size of bulldozer Lugz
Penetentiary, predicate mittons
The heckle and cops spitting, the quicker bomb
In front of the boys, doing a hundred, blowing the blue
System thumping the heaviest noise
Welcome to the wildest city, you already know how it's locks and loads
Empty shells and crack slabs on concrete roads
Look at my eyes, you ain't ready for the overload
You ain't got beef with nobody, stop fronting
Like you want beef with somebody
Everything is revenge, diesel money stay in nothing less than a Benz
This shit is so make believe, young harded ass niggas
Yellow down your back, niggas, perpetrating like your team ride
You ass, come on the outside, look you inside...

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
