INTRO [Korry Deez]
E'rebody ah talk 'bout sound killing
When they dun know, we are original sound killer
Fassyhole you know we
Anytime we start dance-dance a fi lock
Girl follow back a we
We have e'rething pon cock
Can't chant to we
We start dance from 19-o-long
Pick a only firefighter a we collect
A dub plate we have
Anytime we drop Kardinal, IRS and Wio
A blood clot big tune dat

[Kardinal Offishall]
Yes
Oh me oh me oh my (what)
Them a try run Mr. Kardi-ni, flavours you can't deny (what)
'Cause them Circle cats rhyme so fly
Them tracks stay do or die and (what) as (what)
When them write a murder song before a cats can't turn around
I jump and beg for they live (what)
Lick off a style, me-a-fi put dem all back
Rap from T-dot to the Bronx and Bricks and come back
(Will you wake me up?)

[Wio-K]
If an emcee step outta line,I feel them  affi get cut up
But up, lick up, fist up, sound get brek up
Beat up and kick up until they boy start hiccup
(Girlfriend what's your name?)
How ya look, so sweet with your horse legs acting like you're strange
It's full time, now you come off on dat range
My name's Wio, bareback rhyming in the plains

[Allistair]
Blessin' this, effortless, mess with this, eff with this
If you think you got a chance to dance with your devilish messages
Stressing this can only lead to battery
You rattle me, request to battle me I take as flattery
I see ya, grip your bible,I'm the lyrically homicidal idol
Who's liable to take your title with a single recital, it's vital
You respect the steez, I get vexed with ease
Don't make me ask you to respect me please

CHORUS [Jully Black &amp; BlackKat?]
It's an old time, ol' time killing
We a deal with, run and get your money clip
For another day in another way
De man dem, nuh take the ray ray
We are a murderahs
 "The MC..."
