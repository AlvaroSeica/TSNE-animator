Hip-hop love coming at you with a blazing sun
Just like a Bran Van giving you some

[Bran Van 3000]
We'll be the smoothest afrodiziak
we'll be the collest afrodiziak
We'll be the strangest afrodiziak
So why don't you put the record on and wick wick whack
We'll be the smoothest afrodiziak
We'll be the coolest afrodiziak
We'll be the strangest afrodiziak
So why don't you put the record on and kick that track 
[Sara Johnston]
Hip-hop love coming at you with the blazing sun
Just like a Bran Van giving you some 
Hip-hop love coming at you with the blazing sun
Just like a Bran Van giving you some

(What you thinking?)
[James DiSalvio]
I'm thinking sometimes things are moving too fast
Cuz from the very room I'm rhyming 
It be looking like the past 
I know you didn't ask but fuck it
You're stuck with it you got to try, right? right
That's why your basic love for hip-hop got me suckin this mic
I'm like the next Uncle Fester
Another media molester with the flex 
Coming smooth coming strange like grade ten sex
We cling to the text corazon through the chest
You dis it, you like it, we don't give a fuck
Well just a little cuz we hip-hop
Deconstruct, we schmoozing like McLuhan
A slightly shy slightly void nappy, crappy, spinal tappy humainoid

[Sara Johnston]
Hip-hop love coming at you with the blazing sun
Just like a Bran Van giving you some
Cuz you're a cruel girl, what a strange girl in a wicked world
Cuz you're a cruel girl, what a strange girl in a wicked world

[Steve 'Liquid' Hawley]
Nothing left to lose and no time to waste
I'm feeling kinda funny, think my drink is laced
I got these opium queens moving 'round my space
I say it's waste not, want not
I think I'll take another
I'm holding all this pain that I'm trying to smoother w
With the neon glows that keep me thinkin 
About my brother and my mother in the city upon the BV sound 
Bran man got me moving with my ear to the ground
With thoughts of cognac kisses for the men in black
Like in the front line baby I'll be at the back
'Cause I'm chilling on these thoughts of you down with me 
Putting you before the I because it's easy to see 
EP got me smoothing for the BV3
So let it be baby let it be, for real baby
You're the one for me that makes lovin' so much fun
You see, I'm the smoothest afrodiziak
I'll be the coolest afrodiziak
I'm like the strangest afrodiziak
So nick nack paddywack bring it back

[Sara Johnston]
Hip-hop love coming at you with the blazing sun
Just like a Bran Van giving you some 
Cuz you're a cruel girl, what a strange girl in a wicked world

[Steve 'Liquid' Hawley]
Bran Van's in motion
Smooth liquid comin' with the notion and the motion
To recollect and check my memories with degree
Saying we's got necessitites
These recipes I'll be giving 
Cuz freedom's how I'm living
In my life without the strife, who's pushin?
We gots the cushion, so get on your knees and pray to G.O.D.
Set me free from this fuckin' ill society
For real, north to the south, to the east, to the west
Come and bless, Buddha zest got me true to confess
Saying yes yes yes yes
To the top is where I'm reaching 
The chronic got me tweaking
And I'll be reaching for the peaking
More than you ever fuckin' seen, when I soar 
Take flight to the skies on demise
This youth has grown wise no disguise necessary
It's quite contrary, so proud Mary 
Keep on rollin' cuz I'm strollin on the uptown sound
For real so hold tight to the steal 
Lyrical assassins saying caps out to peel

[Poetic/GrymReaper]
Yo, Sharp shooters production
Bran Van 3000, coming through your housing
Yo, yo, get up and do it, yo
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
Get up and do it, get up and do it, get up and do it
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
