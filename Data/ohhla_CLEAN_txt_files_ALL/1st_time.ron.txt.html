Now this is what I am talking about
Stuck in side, but I am letting it out
I am struggling just to keep my poise
And I don't stop screamin' till I lose my voice
Keep on doing what I feel the most
One last hit and then I am ghost
If it's not my fault that's how it has to be
That's how I am keeping my chastity
If I had it all I would give it away
No idea how I am living today
Line by line
Show by show
I got these ladies
Toe to toe
Couple of drinks and I am ready to go
Ask me again and I'll still say no

Chorus:
Don't be hatin' on me baby 
Give me that sweet stuff all night long
I feel like it's my first time 
I feel like it's my first time

I remember the first time I met you
Couldn't for get you
Everything was right
Knew I had to let you
Into my life
But the question was how
It all seems so clear looking back now
Back in '92 didn't have a clue
School bell ring sky clear blue
Get my ass home
Call you on the phone
You promise later on that night 
We be alone
Next five hours, don't think I sat
Took a trip to the store for a lubricated hat
Check my self in the mirror 
91 times
Rehearsed in my head
99 lines
Came to your door
You grabbed me by the hand
Heart beatin' quick
I am about to be a man
Girl, you satisfy my soul
Went to put the Trojan on, shit, it had a hole

Chorus

I am always wakin' up real early 
Some time around two o'clock
Girls can't wait for me to call 
So they can get this started
It's a daily operation
F train to my subway station
But I am still a virgin, babe
So lets stick, to masturbation

Remember shit, I am ready to go
Saw a girl I met at a show
Forgot her name
And she got mad
How could she miss what she never really had?
Got love from here to infinity
Loose control when she's in my vicinity
I want to take her home and show her I am a surgeon
Tell I love her
Then tell her I am a virgin

Chorus</pre>
