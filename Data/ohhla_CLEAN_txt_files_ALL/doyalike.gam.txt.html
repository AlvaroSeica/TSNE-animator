[Intro: Adele]
"Words that I made up, you say my name like..." {*2X*}

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Baby girl, you know what I want
Let me do it to ya, do it to ya
Let me do ya like uh, uh-uh-uh, uh-uh uh-uh uhhh
Uh-uh, uh-uh uh-uh uhhh

[Childish Gambino]
Childish Gambino got that swagger
All these pussy niggaz 'round here don't matter
All that I know is that I wanna dance with ya
Move in closer before I'm gon' kiss ya
Know that you know me, don't act stupid
You seem different, tired of these groupies
I'm on fire, won't find figga
Got big shots sayin, "That's that nigga"
Hovy with glasses, Weezy but geeky
Girls in the lobby, tryin to meet me
I ain't 'fraid to say it yeah I love these hoes
And their glasses and their jacket and their hipster clothes
Yes I'm always on tour, what you mad at that fo'?
Slammin that thang like a Cadillac do'
I love fast women, Jackie Joyner-Kersee
Have your cake and eat it, baby it's your birthday

[Chorus]

[Childish Gambino]
It ain't trickin if ya "you know", baby I "you know"
Momma you are with the right man - Juno
Tell me what you wanna do, I will make it happen
I just wanna get you home and uh-uh uh-uh uhhh
Yes I'm drinkingwhiskey, baby I am gone tonight
NBC is not the only thing I'm comin on tonight
Gross~! Why the fuck I say these things?
It isn't over, haven't heard the chubby lady sing
+Everybody Love+ me, call a nigga +Raymond+
These weak niggaz always in your face like Ray-Bans
Yes, I bring the heat, girl, fire, f-fireman
Baby, I'm your hero, Donald for Spiderman
I'm in love with you, but this is not tennis
And baby stay stacked, like she bad at Tetris
Rude bwoy, I Rihanna that vagina
Tell your boy good luck tryin to find ya

[Chorus] - 4X

[Outro: Adele]
"Words that I made up, you say my name like..." {*8X to fade*}</pre>
