(Verse 1)
(Drunken Tiger in background)
[Micki Eyes]    So we representin' it
             Charter legend shit
             You feelin' it, probably bet again, it's definite
[Tiger JK]      Impresive
             As rippin' the skeleton, that of an elephant
             We took your wives, gentlemen
             With Boogie Night measurements
[Micki Eyes]    The best at this
             Tiger JK, Micki Optical
             If you comin' out the hospital, we got another pocket full
[Tiger JK]      Of ass whippin'
             For any cat that's actin' Nash Bridges
[Both]          Crashin' ya kitchen, smashin' your glass dishes
[Tiger JK]      We stickin' models and actresses, while y'all be kissin' all of the
             Fat bitches and midgets
             My man jiggalicious
[Micki Eyes]    Sho' nuff
[Tiger JK]      Hey, can you dig it? I'm a flip it like Ivani Hannah
             Shifty
             Intoxicated wit, it's still uplifted from that
[Micki Eyes]    Marijuana shit, too, gonna hit you with the shit that be
             Bangin' up on the tracks
             Me and Tiger J go back like we was
             Tango and Cash, like we was Meth' and Redman, or like we was
             Axel and Slash (Dat-dat-dat-dat, dat-dat)
[Drunken Tiger] Dat, dat, dat

Chorus: Tiger JK
One for my haters and two for my peoples
Three times five, Drunken Tiger keeps it lethal
One for your mamas and two for my hoes
Three, four, five, Drunken Tiger keeps it lethal
One for the busters and two for the hustlers
Three times five, Drunken Tiger keeps it lethal
One for my haters and two for my peoples
Three, four, five, Drunken Tiger keeps it lethal

(Verse 2)
[Shine]
I be silent like stealth
Screwin' on the silencer
Anticipating for the kill, now
I'm a have to silence ya
Packin' more heat, than the sun, that's my word (Word)
Stepped in my path, then got instantly murdered
Now that your dead, I'm so glad, cause you deserved it
You was worthless
Had you taken out
Due to a
Nervous distinctive purpose (You'se a bad motherfucker)
True, indeed, my brother
I punish the punisher
He cometh, the summoner
I played around with death
As if it was a game like chess, not even bullet proof vest can protect your
Chest

[Tiger JK]
I bring the pain like Baby Tash' up on the mic and um
Brook-l-yn keeps on taking it, and me, too, came to get some
Me without the mic be like the Smif without the Wessum
I'm wettin' niggas with my rhymes, I'm lyrically handsome
The king, plus the ransom now
Follow the movement
From the Africa to Canton, stomp ya feet
It's Drunken, for the kingdom, Tiger for your soul (Drunken)
Throw your fist, now we the champion (Buck, buck, buck, buck)

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 3: Roscoe Umali]
How many emcees must I run through
Before they figure out, there ain't no fucking with my crew
One, two
I break it down and set it off for all my peoples
Cause when I grab the mic, there won't
Be no kind of sequels
Kuya Roscoe
Umali
The freshest Filipino
You better know your role like Rob Deniro in Casino
Ain't no equals
I keep it raw with styles you can dig
That's word to Drunken Tiger and my DJ James Jhig

[DJ James Jhig]
"Ask 'em"
"What is it"
