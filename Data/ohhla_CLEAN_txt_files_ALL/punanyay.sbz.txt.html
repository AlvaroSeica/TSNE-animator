[Shabazz the Disciple]
From the yard, I said, or in the ocean by the way
She I'm the ghetto rider, we gonna just buy it
We hitting the punanyay, she so greasy
The girl probably told you that she come from Miami
She like to walk with the gun and now she granted
Her man in Sing-Sing, in the bing for armed robbery
So now she stripping in the club to feed the family
They saw the night that she got off the Greyhound
And the police thought of me went to lay down
They brought they hounds and they sniff til they found
In her punanyay was a half of a pound

[Chorus: Shabazz the Disciple]
She-he-she-he, snatch the coke in her pussy
She-he-she-he, why is she transporting heat
She-he-she-he, snatch the coke in her pussy, sy, sy
She-he-she-he, why is she transporting heat
The girl been juggling coke, cross the water
The girl been smuggling boat, cross the water
The girl the mami, punanyay transporter
The girl, the kingpin's daughter

[Shabazz the Disciple]
She come home, pon the bail ten g's
She go to court, the judge offered her 1 to 3
She nah want to go penetentiary
She just beat a drug charge back in Miami
They want deport her back to her country
And threatening her home, they calling her babies
A little trauma, make the girl crazy
She start sniffing the coke, that's in her pussy
Whoa, the girl mocking pussy
The girl be mocking we coke in her punanyay
In California, New York to Miami
The girl done walk with coke in her pussy

[Chorus]

[Shabazz the Disciple]
The next month she had another court date
She told the judge, she usually beat the case
She getting skinny, now the girl losing weight
The judge sentenced her to rehabiliate
In 30 days, I said, nigga, hop the gate
She find the Amtrak, and she hid it out of state
Hold me, now walking dirty
Them walking with coke in her punanyay
In Virginia, Philly and D.C.
The girl walk with coke in her pussy

[Chorus]

[Shabazz the Disciple]
Round midtown, til the police not knock me down, oh
Round midtown, til the bad man want me down
Two days later, now she back in Miami
And the girl got back with an essence, just a leader
Said she up in the spot, helping him bag up a key
The girl ain't stashing the ride, now up in the pussy
Whoa, the girl been walking dirty
The walk ain't walking with coke in her punanyay
In Chi-Town, Manhattan and Jersey
The girlie walk with coke in her pussy
It gets past on her horse now she clean
Got her kids back home, now the officers whole team
The girl they grow up just to be like her mami
Girl now she stashing coke in her pussy</pre>
