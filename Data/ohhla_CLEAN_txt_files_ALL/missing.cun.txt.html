[Intro]
On my way to find myself again I have come a long long from home to see (x3)
Ha Braille, a little louder

[Braille]
My last breath echoes through your oxygen suppy
You not find, I've never been, who I claim
You can't tame the lion when it breaks out of it's cage
Once it breaks out, all over my face
Put your breaks on stop the motion
Robotic movements, rusted by the rain of my Father
Splashin' water out of gates
Flood to the surface of my lyrical percentage
Verbally aggressive, abusive attendance
Unexplained anger slaps my style senseless
How dare I mention mistakes and intentions
Another, star in my collection
The stars I've collected, fell from the sky
I keep fallin', who let my hopes rise?
No parrish ? to provide safety take me
Away from this shallow tide, from the shallow minds
The walls keep closin' in, I've opened every door
The hinges just always squeak (aaah)
I need to loosen up, put it all behind me
And if you're searchin' lost is where you'll find me

[Deacon the Villian]
October 27th 1995
The say I found out my sister was no longer alive
Now, I'm the oldest sibling
with her no longer living on this say day
Decided to give up my bad ways
And to be a model for my younger sister
Wasn't the dumbest ____
But my education was just car heists, burglury, urban liqour
The sort of fingers being curved on triggers
And I knew for certain if I continued
Living life all simple
Jail would be the only institution I'd be able to get into
So I laced by boots
Hit the books, flip from crook
Hopped over my obstacles like rocks skipped on brooks
Music became my medication
Motivation for meditation
Far better than any perscription my man was makin'
Sometimes my head be shakin'
Wondering how my life would be
If things never changed, then she could be beside me
But I disreguard the hypothetics
Won't let stress slice my lettuce
Theoreticaly, she just moved on ahead of me
So my life's patterned across the same finsh line
Live right any part of me that's insane is put to rhyme
Occassionally flames took to pine
Sometimes looked for wine
When I'm in bines I grab the Holy Book to find
A Revelation to raise me out of this metal mess
And remember my life being blessed
Isn't coincidentalness
A simple test we face daily can drive us crazy
Missing Children the confused adults lostin' hope
A noose from rope can dead it
But I won't let it take over me
Got somebody on my soul's shoulder lookin' over me</pre>
