Jason Derulo

[Jason Derulo]
Haha, get jazzy on 'em

I'm that flight that you get on, international
First class seat on my lap girl, ridin comfortable
Cause I know what da girl dem need, New York to Haiti
I got lipstick stamps on my passport, make it hard to leave

[Chorus: Jason Derulo]
Been around the world, don't speak the language
But your booty don't need explainin
All I really need to understand is
When, you, talk dirty to me...
Talk dirty to me...
Talk dirty to me...
Talk dirty to me...
Get jazzy on 'em

[Jason Derulo]
You know the words to my songs, no habla inglés
Our conversations ain't long, but you know what is
I know what da girl dem want, London to Taiwan
I got lipstick stamps on my passport, I think I need a new one

[Chorus] w/ ad libs; minus last line

[Interlude: Jason Derulo]
Uno, met ya friend in Rio
Dos, she was all on me-o
Tres, we could ménage-à-three-o
Cuatro - ohhhhh yeah

[2 Chainz] + (Jason Derulo)
2 Chainz~! Dos Cadenas, close to genius
Sold out arenas, you can suck my penis
Gilbert Arenas, guns on deck (deck)
Chest to chest, tongue on neck (neck)
International oral sex
Every picture I take, I pose a threat (yeahhh)
Photogenic, what do you expect?
Her pussy's so good I bought her a pet
Anyway, every day I'm tryin to get to it
Got her saved in my phone under "Big Booty"
Anyway, every day I'm tryin to get to it
Got her saved in my phone under "Big Booty"!

[Chorus] w/ ad libs

[Outro: woman]
What? I don't understand~!</pre>
