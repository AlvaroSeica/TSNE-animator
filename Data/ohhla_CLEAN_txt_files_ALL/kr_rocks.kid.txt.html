Uh, who are you, who are you
Well I'm the punk with the pump in the back of my pack
How you step Rock (I step in stride)
I step across stage with my nuts in my hand
Them punks wanna front cause I got my own band
God damn I'm the man with the helly buzz
And my shit don't stink like Eli's does
I'm a pleasure girls, man, from what I heard
Nah mah, I kicked that bitch to the curb
I don't really need to be tied down
I'm a ramblin' man, and I'm platinum bound
Me too, rolled my crew, I thought you knew
.16 is what I blew
I bet that set you straight, that illegal action
Fuck that, I still roll with a forty in my lap
Back in second grade I carried a lunch box
Turned twenty-one, stated smokin' crack pots
Snortin' that D by the dime
Wish I could slow down, I'm ahead of my time
I'm the Krack, I'm the Krack
I'm the Krack, Krack, Krack
I'm the Krack, bitch, my last dime's what I'm bettin'
I'm up in the casino with a flash like Stetson
Girls all stare, they gawk, they sneer
So I grab me a bitch and I slapped her in the rear
My living room is the place I'm hangin' out
Young tight pussies is the shit I'm bangin' out
I'm sick of livin' in these perplexed times
That's why I kick these motherfuckin' sex rhymes

I'm headin' down south, uh
I'm headin' down south, check it out
I'm headin' down, headin' down
Hip, hip, hip, hip, diggin' exactly where you go

I'm headin' down south on a dusty path
I got a cool ass buzz and an empty flask
Ass on the wagon and they think I'm all soft
But I don't give a fuck, I'm trippin' my balls off
Up in the crackhouse tunin' them rocks off
Ho's come around and we be knockin' the box top
Knocked out, knocked up, and all that shit
Hot wax, sweaty spot, lickin' spit from your clit
Everything that gets old, it gets over rated
Old to me just means out dated
I'm the Kid Rock, fuck all that sixties shit
Take Woodstock and shove it up your momma's clit
Oh shit, and there it is
I get a lot of pussy cause I'm in showbiz
Twas the night before Christmas and all through the house
I wished for a kiss and your mom popped out
Put her hands on her flop and started eyeing me
So I smacked the old bitch with my flying D
That's when I said man I gotta get a grip and
Looked at the TV, realised I was trippin'
And you don't stop, uh, uh, uh, uh

It ain't no party like a Detroit party
Cause a Detroit party don't stop
It ain't no party like a Detroit party
Cause a Detroit party don't stop
It ain't no party like a Detroit party
Cause a Detroit party don't stop
I said it ain't no party like a Detroit party
Cause a Detroit party don't stop, uh</pre>
