"If I had the time, the things I know I'd find
If I had the time, the things I have to do"
 
[Verse 1]
This is my first confession, my father it's
so hard spilling my heart like Gaza strip
So far I'm scarred like its part of my skin
It's carved in by anger my cardanal sin
My heart large as a lion
The stingers barb had to hit Steve, now I believe I'm dying 
I need your guidance
Need the light that's whiter than silas needing your vibrance
To silence the violent voices the poison
Avoid the poison the paranoid choices destroying
the gift of life that you gave me
Maybe a kiss goodnight from your lady the meaning of life
Then why would you make a world when you scream help they hide
I Know why cause life's a bitch, but you're still here gotta thank god for it

[Chorus]
But I'm falling what else can I say, I'm fading away 
I'm fading away, I'm fading away
I'm falling what else can I say, I'm fading away
I'm fading away, I'm fading away

[Verse 2]
It's been two years since the last time we spoke
I broke the codes of the cannon law you wrote
The stone carved commandments
Feels outlandish live by the laws or vanish
Banished to pandoras box
If I'm real sorry and branish a cross am I lost
for my life time, yeah you watch as a witness
Done some real dumb drunk shit, need your forgiveness
A sickness it's self inflicted, my world revolved around girls
An egyptian curse an addiction swimming in sex
Ma said show women the respect they deserve
Six six six isn't fiction, either listen or your existace will burn
Or the tables will turn on you
Those ladies are humans too, and you abused that
And I knew that, did it for amusement
Now it's on my back like a baboon grooming
Assuming you're losing your patience
If I regain your grace will I have a place in your kingdom 
Or am I facing extinction? The day where the human race starts sinking
is near, pardon my heart almighty
I'm just another part of society, I'm sorry

[Bridge]
Yeah I lied and I stole from thy neighbour
Fornicated way yeah I played up
I havent made a Sunday mass since twelve
Will I ever leave this world?
Yeah I lied and I stole from thy neighbour
My Fornicated ways, yeah I played up
My behaviour is blasphemy
Will it all come back to me? We'll just have to wait and see

[Chorus]</pre>
