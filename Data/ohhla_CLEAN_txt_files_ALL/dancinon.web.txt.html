[Verse Two: Jim Jones]
(JONES!) If  bein fine was a crime, you'd be servin a dime (10!)
Her brains was insane, she said I'm all on her mind (Damn!)
Watchin her every move and stalkin her body parts 
The way I might attack her, she might need her a bodyguard (errrRAUGH!!)
Heh, the Jones, had her like gosh 
Champagne to us is nothin but mouthwash (Got 'em)
You get it from ya mama, shake what she gave ya (And..)
Drop it like it's hot, I couldn't take this behavior (Take dat!)
Pull up to the club and that Lambo is lookin sweet (SWEET!)
Don't know 'bout you, but her hands was on me (Stop touchin..) 
Then she start to feel like the hammer was on me 
But she want to lick the w/rapper like the candy was on me (BLOAW!)
JONES!

[Chorus: DJ Webstar]
Dancin on me she dancin on me, dancin on me she dancin on me
Dancin on me she dancin on me
I don't know about you but she dancin on me
GO GIRL! GO GIRL! GO GIRL! GO GIRL!
GO GIRL! GO GIRL! GO GIRL! GO GIRL!

[Verse Three: Juelz Santana]
Grind on me (Go!), whine on me (Go!) 
Now turn around and put yo' behind on me (Go!) 
Now grind on me (Aye), now grind on me (Aye) 
Now lemme take you home, you can ride on me (Aye)
See ladies love me, girls they adore me 
The haters hate me, but they can't avoid me 
She wanna get kinky, she's all on me 
I wanna get freaky, me so horny (AYYYE!) 
So I whispered in her ear like, "What is we gon' do?" (Huh?)
She looked at her friend, I'm like, "She could come, too" (Let's go)
All three of us should get one room 
And do the things we like to do, ay! (BLOAW!) 

[Chorus: DJ Webstar]
Dancin on me she dancin on me, dancin on me she dancin on me
Dancin on me she dancin on me
I don't know about you but she dancin on me
GO GIRL! GO GIRL! GO GIRL! GO GIRL! 
GO GIRL! GO GIRL! GO GIRL! GO GIRL!
