[Crayon]
I should've listened to my momma
How to keep her when I find her
But I wasn't about commitment
All I wanted was to hit it
After all the other women
I promise after I'm finished I'd come
(Runnin back to you)
But I didn't
Now I'm trapped in a prison without walls
Sittin' in my room anticipating your calls
In spite of it all
If you love something learn to let it go
And if it comes
(Running back to you)
Then it's yours for life
Well maybe then I'll make you my wife
Experiencing lows and highs
Until our demise
Whether you smile or you sigh
I'm a be by your side
Surprised? I came
(Running back to you)
Didn't I?
They say the eyes are the mirrors to the soul
So if you look into mines you should already know
So forget all the hoes after the shows
I'm thinking about home
I'm (Running back to you)
You know?

[Hook]
If I run
When I come, will you still be here?
Don't you go because them others never got the best of me
Let me know
If I run
When I come, will you still be here?
Don't you go because them others never got the best of me
Why do you keep me away?

[Rock Shabazz]
Ayo she don't trust Shabazz
She says them Scorpios is freaks
They got magnetic powers plus they smooth when they cheat
Leave no clues when they speak, but all flowers need the sun
She's plucking out all her petals dreaming that she's the one
I'm her food, shelter clothing
In the mood I get her open
Type to lose it when I'm stroking
But them losers that she rode with in the past gave her baggage
They gassed her with charm and then they dashed like it's magic
Man it had to do damage
She got war between her lips
Peace between her thighs
I breathe the sweetest lies but she reads between the lines
Paranoid, she's torn, I can see it within cause I'm
In a constant tug of war with the exes in her mind
I'm boxing with ghosts, thinking of letting her go
Maybe she's leaving me, Nope!
Switching then gripping me close
She said "My love is a suicide drill
I run away but still I'm"
{Running back to you}
Yeah girl
But like a suicide drill you running further everytime
And coming back tired
I think I gotta draw the line
But often her persistence softens my resistence
Sobbin when she flips, she swore it's gon be different

[Bridge and Hook]
I keep...running..
I know it's been long but I'm coming
I hope I touch down before morning
Yeah Yeah

If I run
When I come, will you still be here?
Don't you go because them others never got the best of me
Let me know
If I run
When I come, will you still be here?
Don't you go because them others never got the best of me
Why do you keep me away?
You keep me away
Don't you go because them others never got the best of me
Why do you keep me away?
(You know we having some problems)
You keep me away
(And you know that we can't solve 'em)
You keep me away
(So baby you know I can't be)
You keep me away
Why do you keep me away?</pre>
