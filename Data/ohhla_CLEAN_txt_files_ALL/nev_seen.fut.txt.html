Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Eskimo
The coolest DJ in the world
Aye, aye, ye, ye, ye
Astronaut nick
I never seen them

[Chorus]
My Gucci got bumps on the tounge alligator wrapped around the sole
You can't find these in the store
You ain't never seen these high top Louis V checkerboard
Walkin like I'm walkin on the moon
I'ma Louis V tycoon
You ain't never seen these

[Verse 1]
Put the Louis on like um bout to go runnin'
runnin to the money why the money steady commin heeyyy
Checkerboard jacket add on the shoes
for racks without the taxes yeahhh I'ma Louis V tycoon
And I took off to the moon and my belt my pants say Louis
I shop so much in Louis you swear the kid was boostin'
The scarf the shades the wallets, chains
I swear I try to buy every thang I hopped on a plane
Flyer than a plane what's my designer name
Bitch I thank I'm Rick James
Fashion is my passion, I'm coordinated
Ain't it ordinary high package I see ya swagger slackin

[Chorus]
