[Verse One: Ice-T]
Saturday night in L.A. - time to play
My beeper is huming like a vibrator, gotta make crime pay
I'm packing two gats and I wish I could carry more
Might sound crazy; but I ran out of the slugs before
Yeah, I know the FEDs watch me
But my vet clashes hard with the VersaceÂ®
So I'm just rolling in my black five hun'
I used to Lowride and that was just for fun
I had five cars, but now I got one
Hard to keep it balling when you're on The Run
I got two keys in my trunk and a shovel
Stepped on them once, so now I got double
The shovel is for drama, need I say more?
I got a fat stash Spot under my passenger floor
That's for the other strap, the automatic type
I gotta keep it close, in case shit gets hype
Got a bitch in jail, she didn't snitch and did three
I'ma have to roll solo, til they set her free
Plus, I got some other crimeys down, true Gs
But they got all day, so now it's just me
And I'ma keep this slang on until the day I die
I can't go straight and won't even try
I'm stuck in the game, so don't ask me why!

[Chorus: Ice-T]
I'm a victim, gotta make crime pay
I gotta make crime pay
I'm a victim, Victim of the Criminal Zone!
I gotta make crime pay
Victim, Victim of the Criminal Zone!
I gotta make crime pay
I'm a victim, a Victim of the Criminal Zone!

[Verse Two: Ice-T]
Now niggaz like to credit and they like to get their loans on
So I hooked up with my boy who turns them phones on
He told me about this nigga who won't pay
He also said: He knew exactly where the motherfucker stay!
So I went and got some homies I hang with
Some crazy motherfuckers, who I used to bang with
We took a trip to his crib, I snatched his whore and his kids
And this is what we did: we tied their punk ass up
I cracked the safe with an axe and then the phones we cut
I didn't hurt his wife
But I promise next time that I would take her life
I shot the nigga in his neck for disrespect our corner body
I got a murder in Miami for a Shoot-out at a party
I got a blood in my trunk, from a punk who squealed
Had a partner tried to play me and his cap I peeled
Now I rest with my finger on my heater
Hand on my beeper, a light sleeper

[Chorus: Ice-T with minor variations]
Victim, gotta make crime pay
I gotta make crime pay
A victim, Victim of the Criminal Zone!
I gotta make crime pay
I'm a victim, a Victim of the Criminal Zone!
I gotta make crime pay
Victim, Victim of the Criminal Zone!

[Verse Three: Ice-T]
I used to slang enough water, you can float a boat
You can ski off the mountains of fucking coke
But now most niggaz serve Chronic
So I let them check a bank, and then I'm all up-on it
I served them with a cute whore
In a week; they tell my bitches about all their dough
Then I jack and I kill
The jack is for the money, the kill is for thrills
I got nine spots in Watts that still serve crack
I got a bitch who works the Plastic tune on the track
Got a G-T-A connection and a fence for jewels
Got some little kids that move fucking dope in schools
Got some warrants for arresting in about twenty states
Got the bigger Body Count in fucking Norman Bates
I'm a killer, jacker, dealer, pimp supreme
I'm living out a Hustler dream

[Chorus: Ice-T with minor variations]
I'm a victim, gotta make crime pay
I gotta make crime pay
Straight victim, Victim of the Criminal Zone!
I gotta make crime pay
I'm a victim, a victim of the Criminal Zone!
I gotta make crime pay
I'm a victim, a victim of the Criminal Zone!

[Verse Four: Ice-T]
Tonight I gotta meet this nigga from around the way
Some say: He is cool, I think he's DEA
He said: He want it bad and heard that I got it good
I bagged up ten keys of flour and met him in the hood
I met him in my spot cause I know it's cool
Pat him down on sight to remove his tool
Made him name ten niggaz he should know
But that still ain't shit in the game of Blow
He asked to see the dope, I asked to see the cash
He reached for that Briefcase too fast
A fucking pig, yo, he thought that he had the chump
I had my nigga in the closet with a Bore Pump (* Gun Shot*)
And now there's fucking Shot-up body all on the floor
But that's what the shovel is for.. victims!

[Chorus: Ice-T with minor variations]
Gotta make crime pay, I gotta make crime pay
Don't be a victim, a victim of this Criminal Zone!
I gotta make crime pay
Victims, victims of the Criminal Zone!
I gotta make crime pay
I'm a victim, a victim of the Criminal Zone!
Gotta make crime pay
