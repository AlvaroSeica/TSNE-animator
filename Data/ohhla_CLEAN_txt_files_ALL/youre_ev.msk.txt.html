[Chorus]
I wanna be your everything
your lover and your friend
I wanna be with you and never leave you until the end of time
I wanna be your everything your lover and your friend
I promise to love you and never play you
so let me make you mine

[Verse 1]
I wanna be your everything
your love and your friend
the one you go to where you don't got to pretend
The one you show your every side to
turn the candle lights to
make sweet love then you don't gotta say goodbye to
Always by your side even when money is low
the one one you truly care about and when you kiss you do it slow
Not like any other
girl you been messing with
The one you tell your secrets to and actually keeps all of them
that's who I wanna be the girl you tell your mom about
and wanna spend your life together cuz
you can't live without knowing in your heart
she would never walk away cuz darling baby
I'm here to stay

[Chorus]
I wanna be your everything
your lover and your friend
I wanna be with you and never leave you until the end of time
I wanna be your everything your lover and your friend
I promise to love you and never play you
so let me make you mine

[Verse 2]
Let me be the one you wanna be with every single day
the one that you would never cheat on if temptation came your way
The one that you would write to if you ever got locked up
deep down in your heart you know she would write you back
Cuz I know you been around more than a few who said
I loved you when you were down and out they quickly forgot about you
If you didn't have a thing to your name that wouldn't matter
together we could build to the top and even higher
Just let me have a little minute of your time so that I can show you things that would really blow your mind
See I'm tired of playing games and I know you must be too
So let me know can I kickit with you?

[Chorus]
I wanna be your everything
your lover and your friend
I wanna be with you and never leave you until the end of time
I wanna be your everything your lover and your friend
I promise to love you and never play you
so let me make you mine

[Verse 3]
So what you say can I keep you baby? Can I call you mine?
You got my number you can call any day at any time
I'll be right there waiting mijo posted by the phone
waiting for my everything to pick me up and take me home
Caress all of my body in the house or in the catty
and make you smile when you hearin me say damelo daddy
(soy tuya) and I'll always be yours
Remain true cuz your the only one that makes me feel the way that you do
So come and get chul tatting my lips up on your neck
Your a fine piece of (aha) and I'll more than represent
I can't wait to start making memories with you

[Chorus]
I wanna be your everything

I wanna be with you and never leave you until the end of time
I wanna be your everything your lover and your friend
I promise to love you and never play you
so let me make you mine</pre>
