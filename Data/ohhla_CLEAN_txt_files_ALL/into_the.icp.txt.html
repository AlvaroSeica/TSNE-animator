The Carney:  Hurry Up, Show's Startin'
The Patron: I ca't believe they're still having it
I better get my butt in there right now

The Ring Leader: Ladies and gentleman, welcome to the sensational
and amazing... "Carnival of Carnage"
They said it couldn't be done, they said it wouldn't last
but boys and girls and everyone we got a carnival for that ass!
Tens of thousands of freaks,sideshows, and fools
a carnival who together lives by their own rules

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
We looked into the stars,foretold everyone
Something dark and wicked this way comes
We told of oddities, crawling from the dark
And a carnival which we can all belong (all belong)
I dwell upon the streets, and I can tell you this
I see some circus, Juggalo shit going on
People drawn together by rare and scubby music
And we even gather once a year to put it down

[Chorus]
With Tilt a whirls and merry goes, and a carnival of faygo
We're just tryin to tell you about the light, right
Now all the jokers cards have fallen with spectacular array
So when the wraith is calling,walk into the light,right

[Violent J]
I hold a bloody axe, dress in hatchet red
We speak in languages people don't understand
I send faygos via punted clear across a staduim in fashion
Only fuckin juggalos could ever demand
I got ninjaz in my backyard wearing Anybody Killa paint
I'm thinkin What the fuck is going on?
Then I see the platinum on the wall, and I realize
The carnivals been right here all along, so lets bring it on

[Chorus]

[Shaggz And J]
The crows have overlooked, we gave you all they gave
The carousel will spin on through the night (through the night)
In oz, I'd be the wizard cause I'm overwhelmed
We just hoped the jokers cards would point you out to the light
So you'll be tight, right

[Chorus] - repeat until end</pre>
