[Jay-Z]
I'm focused man
Tell Stout to holla at me man
Uh, young Hova ya heard?
Trackmasters ya heard?
Yo, yes y'all and Jigga man be ballin'
Leave chicks pigeon-toed some of them be crawlin'
Get the best of you whenever I put my all in
Have mamis callin for the Lord darling
Jigga in call and ass drop
Coupes with half the top, dispose half my knot
Nigga mad when I brag about the cash I got
But I'm used to not having a lot
I'm from the gutta and uh
I ain't the type to ever chase your boss
I'm the type to interior decorate the watch
I'm the type to sling heavy weight on the block
In every state like Pac, word Jigga's the hurt holla

[Mya]
Lips are telling me yes
While you're kissing on my neck
Making me feel so wet
Should I stay, should I go?
I don't know
Your hot boy style drives me wild
But in the back of mind I know

1 - [Mya]
    Even though I wanna see
    How you put that thang on me
    I can't let you get the best of me
    Even though I wanna see
    How you put that thang on me
    I can't let you get the best of me

[Mya]
The best of me
The best of me

Conversation ain't what?
Big thighs got you stuck
Feelings starting to show
Should I stay, should I go?
I don't know
You're driving me crazy
I wanna be your lady
But I got a man at home

Repeat 1

[Mya]
The best of me
The best of me oh

[Jay-Z]
5,4,3,2,1
Carolina blue kicks
Hottest nigga on the block
Used to willie bicycle since I was six, uh
High school crossover wave to wave picks
Music is the same shit, gave away hits
So ma get it together or forget it forever
When I go at you hard I can get it through leather
You act like Jigga can't get at whoever
Talking you got a man, okay ma and
That's high school making me chase you around for months
Have an affair act like an adult for once
Plus my hand is up your skirt goddamn you flirt
What's a little me on top gon' hurt?
Maybe a little but
Pain is pleasure and pressure bust pipes
And you look like the 'I Like It Rough' type
We can crush tonight
Tell me what you like
I got a yellow bottle on a bucket of ice
Get right. Young Hova

Repeat 1

[Mya]
Make it hot, make it hot
