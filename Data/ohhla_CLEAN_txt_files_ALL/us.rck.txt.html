OVO MMG GBE
You already know

[Lil Reese]
At the top it's just us nigga
But I don't really trust niggas (I Don't)
OTF it's just us nigga
But I don't really trust niggas
GBE we don't fuck with niggas
At the top where you see us nigga
Since a youngun' bitch we been them niggas
Since a youngun' bitch we been them niggas

[Rick Ross]
Michael Jackson got them fiends just like Thriller
2 Door Maybach clean, smoking on killer
You a stranger talking and I don't feel it
If I don't know your momma I'm a make 'em feel it
Heavy armour on, you know I wanna shine
Bitch I need it all each and every dime
Photo's taken, fo'door Maybach I know you hatin'
Skatin' with women from Staten Island, my flow's so flagrant
We the realest, pistol conceal my percentage
Higher than yours, Cash Money I see no limits
Port of Miami, them I drop Trilla
Ex dope dealer worth 8 figures

[Chorus]

[Drake]
Just got back from Turks &amp; Caicos hoes all at the villa
Only nigga making albums with no fucking filla
New deal on the table look like 'bout like 10 milla
Shout my lawyer man he a contract killa
You know 305 Ricky that's my fucking nigga
Did this shit right here for [?], preme, styles and [?]
Did this shit right here for Reese, Sosa, Fredo, Durk
You let Drizzy get a verse you gon get this work
Yeah, at the top it's just us nigga
Yeah, that's why I don't really trust niggas
See my family and the money is a must nigga
All the fame and all the pussy is just a plus nigga
Yeahhh

[Chorus]

[Lil Reese]
Since a youngun bitch we been them niggas
A small circle with no new niggas
Cause I don't really trust niggas
GBE it's just us nigga
And she just wana fuck with us
So much kush keep me stuck nigga
In other-words high as fuck nigga
Life's a movie I'm a priceless picture
400 for the belt nigga
Right or wrong you get left nigga
For that back you get left nigga
For my niggas you get left nigga

[Chorus]

[Rick Ross]
I love this beat, oh man I'm finna go bad
I play for pussy, oh man, she gotta be bad
She fuck with me, that bitch know I'm 'bout buy them bags
Beef with me, fuck boy, I'm 'bout to go outback
I woke up counting money, make 'em [?]
Type of money, she fuck me, she gotta fuck us all
Them other boys well known for letting niggas stall
We eating good, not my fault, it Wing Stops
My new home look like it's Al Capone
My new bitch look like she getting involved
My new watch look like I had a stove
Barry Weiss told me I'm gold, God Forgives I don't
Me and Drizzy like the Beatles nigga
Same ones hatin', wouldn't wanna be them niggas
We let em step but we don't see them niggas
We don't see them niggas

[Chorus]</pre>
