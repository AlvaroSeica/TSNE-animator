[Intro]
"And another one, oh... Yes!"

[Verse 1]
The pimp in me sayin nigga just chill
spend that doe like the champagne spill
the thug in me say its time to get ill
time to get rowdy time to get real
the pimp in me sayin stay out the hood
stay in the cut your life too good
the thug in me sayin hit that block nigga
sell that rock nigga bust your glock
the pimp in me say these hoes really love me
and keep payin me there it nothin above me
the thug in me sayin fuck them hoes
they'll stake you if they get the chance focus on doe
the pimp in me said I gotta flash watches
diamonds rings and ain't no other options
the thug in me sayin watch what you coppin
fly low key nigga you know them feds watchin

[Chorus]
Gimme that love pimp or a thug
should I sell pussy or should I sell drugs
you asking for what cash up front
clash with a thug and im blastin you up
gimme that love pimp or a thug
should I sell pussy or should I sell drugs
or should I just bug squeaks or slugs
let ya see the life of a thug what

[Verse 2]
The pimp in me sayin stay on the scene
lounges bars even club marquee
the thug in me say pull up outside
smack the bouncer and keep the toast in the ride
the pimp in me say get out on the floor
bottles in the air dance with a couple whores
the thug in me sayin nigga play the wall
face screwed up keep an eye on all y'all
the pimp in me say take shorty out
put her in a whip take her back to my house
the thug in me say chase this ass out
catch him round the corner press the gat in his mouth
the pimp in me gon take her out all night
put her on the strip and get my money back right
the thug in gonna strip off all his jewels
gun-point his ass and pick off real smooth

(Chorus...)

[Verse 3]
Don't listen to the thug homie that nigga wilin
he gon have your ass doin time on the Island
whatever you say let the chips fall where they may
but imma keep it thug everyday all day
haven't you heard the soldier's song
an eye for an eye and a sword'll cut your tongue
what you know about sacrifice and the scars
you a pimp nigga you aint ready for the war
you don't know what I do every day to beat the odds
homie I go hard prayin to the pimp god
and I gives a lot to Allah and build with the gods
whether im on the street or I'm in a prison yard
then maybe we two of a kind
we brothers from another mother
coming out the same gutter (yeah)
out the same hustle out the same struggle
so holla at a thug if you ever need muscle

[Chorus]</pre>
