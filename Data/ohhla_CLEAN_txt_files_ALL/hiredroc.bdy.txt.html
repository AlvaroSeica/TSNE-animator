[Intro: Ice-T]
Kill, Kill, Kill, Kill! --------&gt; Tupac Shakur
Kill, Kill, Kill, Kill! --------&gt; Tupac Shakur
Murder, murder, murder, murder
Murder, murder, murder, murder
Murder, murder, murder, murder
Murder, murder, murder, murder
Kill, Kill, Kill, Kill! --------&gt; Tupac Shakur

[Verse One: Ice-T]
Jacker of life, the last thing you'll see is the flash
The last picture's my mask, the last breath is your gasp
The roar of a machine, the smell of burnt flesh
Hot brass ejects, slugs rip your weak vest
Feel your bones shatter as my bullets ricochet
This game is gun play, kill with skill
I get the contract, make your will
Cause I never miss, I'm the best at this!

[Chorus: Ice-T]
Murder for Hire!
Murder for Hire!

[Verse Two: Ice-T]
Don't give a fuck who you are, the cash moves me
M-O-B, C-I-A, F-B-I, gives me money for blood
Take you out in a club, your car explodes in the Lot
Bodyguard, wrong move, you shot
I'm a get you when you at least expect it right in the head
You can't get got, no way?
I'll hit you from a block away
It's my decision, I got you in my night vision
Snipe, I'm the type, that'll kill you with a butter knife

[Chorus: Ice-T]
Murder for Hire!
Murder for Hire, Baby!
Murder for Hire!
Murder for Hire, Baby!!
Murder for Hire!
Murder for Hire, Baby!!

[Outro: Ice-T]

Murder - Kill, Kill, Kill, Kill! --------&gt; Tupac Shakur
Murder - Kill, Kill, Kill, Kill! --------&gt; Tupac Shakur
Murder - Kill, Kill, Kill, Kill! --------&gt; Tupac Shakur
Murder - Kill, Kill, Kill, Kill! --------&gt; Tupac Shakur
Murder - Kill, Kill, Kill, Kill! --------&gt; Tupac Shakur
Murder for Hire, Baby!
