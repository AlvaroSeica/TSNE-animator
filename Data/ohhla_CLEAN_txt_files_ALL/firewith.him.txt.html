[Hook]
It's a long road
Staring at me
Can't breathe
Can't see
Lord won't you save me, Lord

[Chee Malabar]
This is the fire within like when the Harlem Choir sings
Amidst the leviathan, the science of this Nair prince
Since he died for my sins and I aint Christian
Been constantly considering the concept of heaven
Through rhythms reminiscent of distant drums that bring hums
Brought 'Wince at the Sun' while a sepia hued moon hid
This is solace music for the deeply wounded
Who live in a vaccum, my rhymes is a broomstick
To, match that pullm had to master cool
Transformed to a December like Alaskan mood
Through the summer, winter, fall, spring, spit sleet mang
So when you drop degrees to where my tears should freeze pain
I rock Bermuda shorts, only complaining 'bout a heat wave
Catch me on Ebay selling Rodney King's beat tape
Just to reincite folks you consistently shit on
This is food for thought for starving artists to binge on

[Hook]
It's a long road
Staring at me
Can't breathe
Can't see
Lord won't you save me, Lord

[Rainman]
Let the fires begin, the rappers and liars pretend
Inspired to bring, the styles that make the town crier begin to sing
The figure within the dream
I take wings, glue Â‘em and face the sun
If I lose, at least I can say that I embraced the drum
Set my rhythm and changed for none
We independent since the days of pause mixed tapes
And fifty dollar karaoke boxes (yeah!)
Pompous to some cause I compromise to none
Take it or leave it come on
Rainman the truth
Lock stock and two, smoking guns with the focus of one
Beautiful mind, cerebellum soaked in rum
So we could ignite the beat before motherfuckers could burn the track
Learn the facts, or get drunk off the worm you drank
You got a couple years left
And then they throwing Chee in an internment camp

[Hook]
It's a long road
Staring at me
Can't breathe
Can't see
Lord won't you save me, Lord</pre>
