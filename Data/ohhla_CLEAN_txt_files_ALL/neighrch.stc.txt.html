Quuuuwep

My nigga I get biz

My pockets fatter than a bitch

[Street Child]
I'm a haters worse nightmare
Ball hard no fear shit yeah
Large Money I throw it in the air
I rock hard grandma chair yeah
I'm the flyest you ever came across
Move snow santa clause
I'm a handyman I'm good with the tool
We tied up you still lose
Certified goon shoot at high noon
The money long like clown shoes
I'm in the wind here and there
Duffle bag I carry everywhere
Stop and stare my swag tuned up
Novacaine bracelet my wrist numb
Money comes and goes
Check the bank roll
Shooters on deck kill when I say so

[Chorus]

[Dout Gotcha]
Gotcha the king of the rocks there is none higher
Kiss my ring call me sire
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But words will never hurt me
Black mask black gloves black snub on me
Bout to do some nigga dirty you heard me
King kong gotcha still stepping on the city
More money more problems still stepping on it with me
These niggas hated on me cause I keep some paper on me
Anti social stay away from the phoney
All family over here fuck a stickman and homie
Pal and friend need piles of dividends
Stacks so high that they touching the ceiling fan
Stack on the mac chop a man in half luitenent dan
We getting money make a monkey hit a handstand
We gurillas original cap peelers gotcha

[Chorus]

[Street Child]
Fresh off the wagon
Flyer than a phantom
Chillin on the crate strapped with two ratchets
So big inspector gadget wont clap it
I'm in the hood I stay clean
I got green im in the field of dreams
I'm coming up nigga I got a head of steam
I keep your girl legs open like a balance beam
I get busy keep a loaded semi with me
Message to the haters I need them I'm still waiting
Follow if you can I chill in  vacation
I'm in the kitchen mixing with a designer apron
My whole block eating we got the pies baking
Money by the piles whips with no miles
Ride by show the watch and dont smile
Party hard stay strapped and dont slip
Street Child and Gotcha neighborhood rich

[Chorus]</pre>
