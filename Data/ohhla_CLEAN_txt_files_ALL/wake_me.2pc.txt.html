[Babatunde Olatunki]
Please.. wake me when I am free
I cannot bear activity
Where my couch, I am told, "Hold no significance"
I waited and died in ignorance
but my inner eye can see, erase
who reigned as king in another place
The green trees were reached from fall
and every man spoke of beautiful men and women together as people

War was gone because all was at peace
but now like a nightmare, I woke to see
that I live like a prisoner of poverty.. 

Please.. wake me when I am free
I cannot bear activity
Fall, I will have a ?, stricken blind
than to live without expression of mind
