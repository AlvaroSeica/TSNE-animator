Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Tearing me apart with words you wouldn't say
Suddenly tomorrow's a moment washed away
'Cause I don't have a reason, and you don't have the time
We both keep on waiting for something we won't find

Light on the horizon was brighter yesterday
Shadows floating over, scars began to fade
We said it was forever but then it slipped away
Standing at the end of the final masquerade

Final masquerade!

All I ever wanted, the secrets that you keep
All you've ever wanted, the truth I couldn't speak
'Cause I can't see forgiveness, and you can't see the crime
And we both keep on waiting for what we left behind

Light on the horizon was brighter yesterday
Shadows floating over, scars began to fade
We said it was forever but then it slipped away
Standing at the end of the final masquerade

Final masquerade!
Final masquerade!
Standing at the end of the final masquerade!

The light on the horizon was brighter yesterday
Shadows floating over, scars begin to fade
We said it was forever but then it slipped away
Standing at the end of the final masquerade

Standing at the end of the final masquerade!
Standing at the end of the final masquerade!
Final masquerade!</pre>
