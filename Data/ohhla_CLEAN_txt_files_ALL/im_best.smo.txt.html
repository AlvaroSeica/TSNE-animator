Typed by: ST

[Verse 1]
I leave my enemies piled
in the cemetry while
Jeremy Kyle, is telling me, I'm a heavenly child
and charges, they brought against me
would never be filed, cos I rap with a flavour that could never be mild

[Chorus]
I'm the best, there aint no question about it
Laid to rest, are those mutherfuckers that doubt it
I'm the best, I'l have you mutherfuckers surrounded
and if you mutherfuckers believe it then now shout it
I'm the best, there aint no question about it
Laid to rest, are those mutherfuckers that doubt it
I'm the best, I'l have you mutherfuckers surrounded
and if you mutherfuckers believe it then now shout it
I'm the best

[Verse 2]
You can tell when I rap
I've been to hell and I'm back
I got the mack
Plus I got the fucking L in a nap sack
like Aztec kings, destroying cities in flames
slice you with obsidian blades
grenades and ammunition had you missing
pissing, and spitting out ya dentals
the braves cats get religious when the gats at their temples
slit ya throat, pull the tongue through the hole
Columbian neckties, creap into ya home
I come to snatch you out ya bedside
I got friends galore that live a life against the law
put a knife against your wife and put your wife against the floor
Drag you in the drawing room, feeling quite a sense of awe
wrap you up in cellophane, kill you for a tens of draw
That's the cost of spitting, wack rhymes that you've got to bitten
I accost em with the rhythm
drown em, like a box of kittens
With Tokes, there's no need to worry ya ass
like a quarry I blast, I come
from the warrior class, yo

[Chorus]
I'm the best, there aint no question about it
Laid to rest, are those mutherfuckers that doubt it
I'm the best, I'l have you mutherfuckers surrounded
and if you mutherfuckers believe it then now shout it, I'm the best

[Verse 3]
For future reference, please stop sending me death threats
or I'm a get vexed
and bash you over the head with dem wrecked decks
For back stabbing, I drag drag him
into the back of a black wagon
where I back slap him (what)</pre>
