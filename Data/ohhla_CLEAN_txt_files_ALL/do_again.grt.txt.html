Announcement: "1,2 1,2; In the place to be! I am Bonafide (The Original MC)
and on the side of me, is my man; dat boy, Coffee!
And when it comes to RHYYYYYYYYMES (we gon' do it again)
uh uh hey hey (we gon do it again)"

[Chant]
ROCK THE HOUSE, ROCK ROCK, THE HOUSE (we gon')
ROCK THE HOUSE, ROCK ROCK, THE HOUSE
WE GON' DO IT AGAIN, WE GON' DO IT AGAIN
ROCK WIT YA, BABY, WE CAN CHANGE YOUR WORLD!

[Chorus]
And we gon' "DO IT AGAIN"
Dem boys rockin' your world (world)
A Pearl Diamond shinnin' like your favorite girl
It's like a dream (dream) A present wrapped in .
for the scene
2 Thrones (A King)
Open your mind to new things

[Verse 1]
Nah, it ain't a "Comeback", but "Doin' It Again"
Got a catalog that deserves a Pulitzer win
Time to sick back, franchise &amp; lock it all in
Get the stock up and lay back &amp; rock it wit dem
I'm not a free-styler, but I've freed a few
Open doors, let 'em in and they're people too
Told 'em "OPEN BAR" drank it til it's though
The "Reiterate" it, now "Quarantine" do.
Won't front, 'might need a lil' juice w/this
Top shelf might feel a lil spoof of this(let's go)
Got the antidote deeper than a beat will go
Got your beater on actin' like "ye ain't know"
(hahaha)
Before the rooster crows, before the final show
(yeah) I'll leave a vibe that will take about a year to go
This ain't a "Minute Clinic", More like the VA.
Old Skool; I Walked w/Christ way before 'Ye (Kanye West) Doing It!

[Chant]
ROCK THE HOUSE, ROCK ROCK, THE HOUSE (we gon')
ROCK THE HOUSE, ROCK ROCK, THE HOUSE
WE GON' DO IT AGAIN, WE GON' DO IT AGAIN
ROCK WIT YA, BABY, WE CAN CHANGE YOUR WORLD!

[HOOK]
And we gon' "DO IT AGAIN"
Dem boys rockin' your world (world)
A Pearl Diamond shinnin' like your favorite girl
It's like a dream (dream) A present wrapped in .
for the scene
2 Thrones (A King)
Open your mind to new things

[Verse 2]
The Brightness is seeming endless
It's slim pickings as the plot thickens
Sometimes it's scary feeling chicken skinless
Will let it up, it's coming down relentless
Instant thought of .
burnin' certain closing curtains on every word or sentence.
Travel by night, might think it "Finite" it should be "Infinite"
Life's a blur, mix it up and sitting in it, invisible
the windows tinted, the outside reaps if you leave music for weeks and get it complimented.
We hopped on high percentage, stakes elevate when liars play
Never treat it like a scrimmage is a phony image (echo)
What's given to the meek and timid
could be prosperous in the beginning, there's a pending limit
You're poor acting like it's more, you pretend to mimic
Amazing and no wonder how you squander
Many remnant represented "Chitter-Chatter" talk on iPhones, stolen device ..
And it Matters that this pattern has been pain mistakenly life long

[CHANT]
ROCK THE HOUSE, ROCK ROCK, THE HOUSE (we gon')
ROCK THE HOUSE, ROCK ROCK, THE HOUSE
WE GON' DO IT AGAIN, WE GON' DO IT AGAIN
ROCK WIT YA, BABY, WE CAN CHANGE YOUR WORLD!

[HOOK]
And we gon' "DO IT AGAIN"
Dem boys rockin' your world (world)
A Pearl Diamond shinnin' like your favorite girl
It's like a dream (dream) A present wrapped in .
for the scene
2 Thrones (A King)
Open your mind to new things

[VAMP]
WOAH WOAH 1,2 1,2! In the place to be!
Bonafide (The Original MC) 1-1-1,2 1,2
GRITS! ROCK THE HOUSE! DAT BOY, COFFEE
WE GON' DO IT AGAIN, WE GON' DO IT AGAIN
ROCK WIT YA, BABY, WE CAN CHANGE YOUR WORLD!

[HOOK]
And we gon' "DO IT AGAIN"
Dem boys rockin' your world (world)
A Pearl Diamond shinnin' like your favorite girl
It's like a dream (dream) A present wrapped in for the scene
2 Thrones (A King)
Open your mind to new things (hey hey hey..)</pre>
