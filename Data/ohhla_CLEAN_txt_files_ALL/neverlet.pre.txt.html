Baby girllll (Baby girl take ya time)
Baby girl take ya time (baby girl take ya time)
Please don't rush and go (don't rush and go)
I can never let you leave (I can never let you leave)
And I don't wanna have to see ya go

[Chorus]
No No I can't let ya go
No No I can't let you go
No No I can't let you go
No No I can't let you go

See I'm the life of the party
The flashy dude on the scene
I had the way with the ladies since the age of 13
Dis girl dat girl so many beautiful queens (yep yep)
Now I can't say that me fighting temptation ain't hard
but I never let another chick to come tear us apart girl
You know you got ya name tatooed on my heart
real talk thats how I feel you ben from the start

[Chorus]

Baby girl don't leave I need somebody right here to help me smooth think out
like coming home off the road from touring to a happy home
see that what I'm talkin bout
see I'm givin you the benefit of the doubt
you gettin all mad and got me sleepin on the couch
you trying to get chicken but right here you got steak
stop trying to break up somethin good ya gotta have faith
cuz its in god's hands plus I'm being a bigger man
And I'm a veteran come on girl give me one mo chance

[Chorus]

You was there before the deal
me and you was like jack and jill
all I wanted was a varsity jacket and a yearbook to remember the years
see you stopped believing in me when I needed you the most
but you want a weddin ring the most I propose is a toast
I was beggin you to stay pleading wit you not to leave
but you left me anyway and all that I can do is grieve
I thought I needed you thought I couldn't be anythin without you
now I'm the one you beggin to because I made it without you

ooooo you're in my heart, you're in my soul, you're on my mind, all the time
you're in my heart you're in me soul you're on my mind all the time

No No I can't let ya go no no I can't let you go no no
I can't let you go never gon let you go</pre>
