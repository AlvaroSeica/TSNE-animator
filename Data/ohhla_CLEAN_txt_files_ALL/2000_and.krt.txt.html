[Intro: sample from the film "Dead Presidents"]
"Right now we'd like to bring on a young man who believes in doing things his own way
 And based on the way he kinda get next to all of the folks who've seen him work
 his way has gotta be pretty hip, so let's lay some noise"

"They send our people to fight for this so-called democracy
 But when they get back down to the South et cetera, et cetera
 shit is worse than ever
 There is something very sick about that
 Power to the people!"

[Big K.R.I.T.]
2000 and beyond
2000 and beyond
2000 and beyond

Tricks and hoes, bitches and stripper poles
Shake it for dollar signs, let me see from behind
The ghetto's a fairy tale, pimps and jezebels
Dealers with chrome rims with product for you to sell
Chemistry in the kitchen, alleys with rubbers in it
Tires go round and round, windows heavy tinted
Kush is scented inside
Pull me over, now they talking bout a canine ("Code 6")
Black man face down, damn
Charge it to the game
Bums warm they weary souls over open flames
Junkie can't find God, watch him find his vein
Preacher walk right by like he ain't seen a thang
Pass the collection plate
Niggas thought shit was gon' change on election day
Healthcare, H1N1 nasal spray
Got me scared to hit the block
Wear my flag as a mask, tote a Glock

[Interlude: sample from the film "Dead Presidents"]
"To tell you the truth, I'm not sure I even want any of this dirty money"
"Well, I'll tell you what Reverend
 We'll find something to do with your share"
"No, no-no-no-no, I'll take the money
 I'm sure the Lord will find another way for me to do my penance"

[Big K.R.I.T.]
Poor folk scrape dollars, spend the last
of they income tax on Impalas with the SS
Church give awards, who the best dressed?
Pastor drive a Bentley, got me thinking I was less blessed
cause I let a middle man
He was capping what I'm asking, I don't understand
How you fit that many rings on a helping hand?
Tired of deception
But I pay his kid's tuition cause I'm tryna get to Heaven
Ain't it crazy? Scared to have a baby
How can I protect it from the same streets that made me?
Concrete gladiator, bloodshed overflow
Real life, some places Russell Crowe would never go
Pimp tight flossing, look at what it cost me
Peace of mind, no sleep, late night tossing and turning
Waiting on the end, pray to God, forgive me for my sins

[Interlude: sample from the film "Dead Presidents"]
"You know how I survive?
 Cause I don't think about the world, that shit don't exist to me
 I don't give a fuck about anything or anyone in it
 because the minute I do, I'm a dead man out here
 and you remember that shit"

[Big K.R.I.T.]
As a child I was cold with a chip on my shoulders
Grandma told me be careful cause there's sharks in the water
They will kill you, let the Good Lord steer you
Don't worry bout the government, cause baby they don't feel you
Martin Luther King had a dream, we was right there
I wonder what he saw when he up and had nightmares
Quite scared, all the work he had done
couldn't stop what we've become

In 2000 and beyond
In 2000 and beyond

[Outro: sample from the film "Dead Presidents"]
"Ain't nothing I say gon' get me out of this
 But things were getting bad for me, and
 I had to do what I had to do to s-, to survive"</pre>
