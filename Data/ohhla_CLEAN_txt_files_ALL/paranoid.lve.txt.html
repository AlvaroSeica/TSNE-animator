Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I see two of my bitches in the club
But they don't know about each other
But wouldn't I be a pimp if I set them up
To have a threesome with your boy
If they not too paranoid

Now one of my chicks she's straight from Vallejo
She be in the eight, though, and she got a boyfriend
She got a boyfriend but she only love him for his bankroll
She texts me like "I wish I was with you and not with him"
I hit her back like "Well, if you ditch that nigga we can get it popping, then"
Turn the lights on
And on her own she came over
Already had a pretty little thing over
She said, "Baby girl look good as fuck
Hope you let me beat it up"

I see two of my bitches in the club
But they don't know about each other
But wouldn't I be a pimp if I set them up
To have a threesome with your boy
If they not too paranoid

Now I be on the west side throwing up my shit high
D1, that's my only game
And all the bad bitches show a nigga love
The scared hoes running like they owe me change
I heard Mustard on the beat and I'm fucking with a freak
High rolling up the weed, bitches in the backseat
And when she bust it open, baby girl, you better eat
And if you don't get to stepping like you pledging Greek
You know it's real, same nigga with the lights on
Dark skinned nigga with the ice on
Out in Vegas try to fight on, pretty bitches blowing dice for him
Your baby momma might know him, you should be nice to him
Keep a poker face, pull it out and poke her face
Suck a nigga, you should know your place
I see your hoe, meet your hoe, feed the hoe and get the hoe replaced
Big bills, never lower case

I see two of my bitches in the club
But they don't know about each other
But wouldn't I be a pimp if I set them up
To have a threesome with your body
If they not too paranoid</pre>
