[Verse 1]
And say yeah, and say yeah, and say yeah 

One night in town (one night in town) 
My niggas 'round (my niggas 'round) 
Throwin' money (money) 
Them bitches hit the ground (whoo) 
Then bring it back up (yeah) 
She bring it back up (ay bring it back up) 
Put 'em in that black truck 
So many hoes, they lapped up (lapped up) 
My niggas leanin' (my niggas leanin') 
Diddy boppin' (diddy boppin') 
Lets get it poppin' (yeah) 
I said lets get it poppin' (yeah) 
Just look at how she drop it (drop it) 
Little mama a certified pro (pro) 
She need her own show (show) 
Slide on down that pole and grind slow (slow) 
Hell no, I ain't countin' my dough 
I came to blow it all (blow it all) 
And get some brains 
Tryin' to find, "Mrs. Know It All" ("Mrs. Know It All") 
And I got my cup filled 
You see how them bucks peel 
Young pimp, see I grab me up a chick and just chill 

[Hook]
In the back of the club 
With a stack full of dubs 
Drop it low 
Like a pro 
Bring it back 
That's what's up 
All my dogs 
Up in here 
Cuz there's hoes 
Everywhere 
Niggas stunt 
Like you don't care 
Throw that money 
In the air 
And say yeah (yeah) 

(Chorus)

[Verse 2]
I'm high and drunk, doin' my same dance (dance) 
They call her, "Pocahontas" 
Doin' that rain dance (yeah) 
Talkin', "Dough, I got it" 
So make it rain, man (man) 
Cuz the flow retarded 
Sorta like that rain man (ay) 
Borderline insane man (ay) 
Look at all these dames, damn (damn) 
With a nigga gettin' money (money) 
And I'm a changed man (man) 
You smell that haze scent (scent) 
Know my game plan (plan) 
Tryin' ta' get it smackin' (smackin') 
I ain't with that game plan (nah) 
Lil mama work for every dollar 
She drop it low (drop it low) 
Pop it slow (pop it slow) 
Stop and go (whoo) 
Lots of smoke 
We keep 'em rollin' up (rollin' up) 
Shawty mad, she came with you, she wanna roll with us 

[Hook]

(Chorus)

And say yeah 
I said listen here (here) 
I do it grande (grande) 
All day (all day) 
Smokin' on that bomb, hey (yeah) 
And I got my cup filled 
You see how them bucks peel 
Young pimp, see I grab me up a chick and just chill 

[Hook]

(Chorus) (x3) 
Roll that money in one hand and say yeah 
Throw that money in the air and say yeah 
Roll that money in one hand and say yeah 
Throw that money in the air and say yeah</pre>
