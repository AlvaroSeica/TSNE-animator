[Intro]
Ayo Drew, turn my mic up
Cause I want these motherfuckers to hear me
I see you rap bitches talking real slick in the magazines
I'm the same bitch your man want and your best friend's a Trina fan
Hahah y'all bitches funny to me
You know what?
I feel like playin
I'm in the air, I don't hear bitches corny raps
The baddest bitch is back (2X)

[Chorus]
What's beef?
Beef is when a bitch titties looking like they sleet
Beef is when her clothes looking like dirty sheets
Beef is when I help you sell the records just like I do, now that's beef
What's beef?
Beef is when these hoes say my name in the streets
Beef is when they fame only last a few weeks
Beef is when I help you sell the records just like I do, now that's beef

[Verse 1]
My blades been sharp, my spades been played with this one
But nuh uh, this ain't a game with this one
See, I'ma put some hoes to shame so listen
I done seen a lot of lame but it's a shame that this one
You see the problem is I used to like Khia til you started
Jumping on the dick with Trick and doing all of my leftover shit
Now yous a scam, What's up? You get the leftover hits
Bitch get on the bandwagon or get left over bitch
Can't believe the Baddest Bitch whipped this drunk ass bitch
Her slay titties havin, fake Lauryn Hill ass bitch
Move to Georgia cause in Florida, you wasn't hitting on shit
Now you's a mess hoe, that's why they cut you out your own video
You dissin for promo and dissing me is a no-no
I'm the queen of rings riches and dough hoe
But back to the promo, yo I'ma still try and help you out
Ay y'all I'm talking bout Khia, dirty bitch of the south

[Chorus]
Now what's beef?
Beef is when a bitches titties looking like they sleet
Beef is when her clothes looking like dirty sheets
Beef is when I help you sell the records just like I do, now that's beef
What's beef?
Beef is when these hoes say my name in the streets
Beef is when they fame only last a few weeks
Beef is when I help you sell the records just like I do, now that's beef

[Verse 2: Fake BG]
Your neck and your back bitch, you know you was wrong
And can't Wayne hoe? I ain't even like that song
Oh is all of this just over some dick?
I told you in my debut, Best Friends, I do five or six
Enough of that bitch, I got some other shit to address
About some pussy ass niggaz with my name in they tracks
Sayin' (Trina fucked Baby now she fuckin' Lil' Wayne)
You niggaz snitchin on your records, fuckin' up a bitch name
You wouldn't do that to a nigga so why you do it to me?
You sounding like a hoe nigga, why you slandering T?
Cause yous a Cash Money reject, a ninth ward soldier
Keep fucking with that boy and you gonna end up in a coma
And what about the waterboy, kid the silly
Last I heard you ain't even from Philly
So nigga keep the bitch women and let the players handle this shit
Cause you just dissin for a deal but I'm dissing with the real, Yup

[Chorus]
Now what's beef?
Beef is when the dope make a nigga fall asleep
Beef is when you sound like a motherfucking sheep (Ba Ba)
Beef is when I help you sell records just like I do, now that's beef
What's beef?
Beef is when a street nigga beefing with a chick
Beef is when you brag on another nigga's dick
Beef is when I help you sell records just like I do, now that's beef

[Outro]
Punk niggaz
You niggaz can't be serious
You niggaz is real fucking funny to me
Get the fuck out of here</pre>
