	"Terrorized New York with the random killings of six"

  "His neighbors called him a regular sort of guy.  He loved
   hamburgers and chocolate ice cream."

	"Hannibal Lechter's got nothing on these guys. Twisted
         minds hidden behind commonplace lives. Tonight find out
	 what drives their deadly obsession. And meet the men
	 whose only obsession is catching them."

[Kool Keith]
When I was a little kid, I got lost, my mother was out shopping
Mommy? Where are you?

Well I got on the D train, rode to the Bronx
Kinda walked up the steps to California
Then I walked through Sunset, Beverly Hills Mall
Came through a door in Santa Cruz
I looked around, bought ice cream, got on the elevator
Took it way up to San Fransisco
Back down I went in, pressed "One"
With my bag and my coat on 34th street
I turned the block, walked up to Minnesota
Got in a cab and went to Idaho
He charged me 5 dollars, I took a shortcut
I said "Let me out, yo why we in Florida?"
I seen this cutie fine honey out in Disneyworld
We took a picture with Mickey Mouse, stealing in Texas
Two blocks from home in Yankee Stadium
I went inside of McDonald's and got a cup of tea

	Mommy? Mommy? Mommy?! (I'll put your brain in slow motion)
	Mommy? Mommy? Mommy?! (I'll put your brain in slow motion)

Got off the bus in Arkansas
Made a left a right to magic city
I went inside the place and made a phone call
Across the street was packed in Shea Stadium
While the Mets was up, I bought a pretzel
Ate a steak in the Bronx, and went to Philly
I looked around the corner and saw Arizona
Took and escalator down to Kansas City
Walked and entered the train
At 59th Street North Carolina

Now I'm a finish right here because I forgot the other parts of the rhymes
This is something that's new, sombody has never done
People don't always do this, but this is a record that
I want to talk it out, I want to reason with you
I want to get the deal, I want to show girls that I love them
I want to hold them tight
Mommy? Where are you mommy? MOMMY?!? Mommy?
People, humans
