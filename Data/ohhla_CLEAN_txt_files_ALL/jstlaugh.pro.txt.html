Typed by: Davida.b.

[Intro 4X: KRS-One sample]
I just laugh, I just laugh, because no one can defeat me

[Pro the Leader]
I just laugh, no one can defeat me
Raffle supremecy, Pro's Laboratory
I'm too raw, you can't break down my integrety
People use my lyrics as a conversation piece
If I wasn't ill, you would have nothing to talk about
I see you tryin' to be hard, to be, somethin' you not
If it doesn't come natural, apparantly it wasn't meant to be
Look in my eyes, I can tell if you're the type that lies frequently
Will lies beneath my purpose
You nobody, I'm somebody, that everybody wants to be
Am I concernced with you, son? Yo, not at all
You try to hate on us because you're not involved
I'm too sufficient for your insignificant feeble mind to comprehend
Over your head, only time will tell what's gonna remain
Will refrain from using similes, ahead of the rest, you artist
Pinpoint the masses, drastic measures have now been taken

[Holocaust]
Framed Chrono Cross, throwin' hip hop tracks, the destroyer
Taste the Moongod, as you ain't friend of Tom Sawyer
Sick pick pocket, the lawyer
Bangin' like Meth, Ghost, Rae, RZA and all of them
I keep a beat cruisin' like Christy Turwinkle made by Swin
I drink a whiskey distilled from corn mash, friend
Bandanna, and a bony fish bonanza
We blood your bullies on severe boob tubes
Blood thirsty, never fagazi, Navy boys in blue bomber jackets
And heavy blue jeans, walkin' on beige rackets
That body bag the bombshell, drove bowling
Bon voyage you in the back cat, with the black jack
Bows and bunnies, alls you is block heads, is whoosers
Walk heads, bloopers, we blue plate the road China
Buddha the boxcar, yeah
Knife scar and act moisterous, act moisterous
Boardwalk mic word, your flag is hoisterous
Yeah, it burn like black of bag bats
Rhymes is Bazooka Joe, blow torch, blow gun
Or I par, jump your brother hood, with bats the size of blue whales
Blue whales, batting cage, rage nail
Conquerous rule, conquerous rule, blue apples
Orange apples, yeah and swing like a brontosaur
Monster war, conquerous rule, conquerous rule
Do the brawler, blue blood aristocrats eatin' blue cheese
In the harbor, ice parlor, black rackets and you sneeze
Alcatraz Beer Brewery, niggas is screwin' me
Gun blast turk, chicks suck bust
Stung flash jerks, gun blast turk
The Baltimore Black Sox, hawks galore, gas shot
Candy Miami, Larry Zark, sponsor this jewel</pre>
