Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Intro/Outro: repeat 4X]
We ain't givin up (nah) we ain't get enough (yeah)
Go on get 'em up - don't, look, down

[Random]
I'm the difference between, all the kids on the scene
I'm like Pippen on D, nobody gettin through me
People thinkin I'm rich, cause I'm livin the dream
But how quick they forget, there ain't no trick to it
Heh~! The truth is I'm resolute, I do what you never do
Better than you ever could do it; let 'em through
Heh~! I say I'm a changed man, I got a new game plan
The logo is new, yet, still it's the same clan

[Chorus: Ayana]
Things are lookin up, oh finally
I thought I'd never see the day when you'd smile at me
We always pull through, oh when we try
I'm always wrong but, you're never right - you're never right

[Random]
When I writin a rhyme, I take my life and my times
And put 'em right in the lines it seems obvious
But when I first started spittin, everything that was written
was undoubtedly fiction like a lot of kids
But eventually I decided to be true to me
That was the best decision that I ever made
Now every September 3rd is like July 4th
We up in magazines, we headline tours
Never coulda dreamt this back in nine-four
Got here in five years, just imagine five more
When I made "The Call" I ain't wanna rap further
Now they say I'm sick, Parkinsons, Aspbergers
The music is therapy, to whoever hearin me
The moment of clarity, is part of me still
Wanna wish a disease, on who didn't believe
Before you pick up and leave, keep a trick up your sleeve

[Chorus]

[Random]
Man I come from a block, where we struggled and fought
Slang a couple of rocks, brothers takin no shorts
And the name of the game here's survival
Outblast your rival, its cutthroat, +Gunsmoke+
But yo, amongst these inhabitants
You'll also find a couple law school graduates
We ain't all savages, it's easy to blame the kids
when they ain't the reason that thangs is the way it is
Naw it ain't perfect, but we make it work
Handshakes is cool but I need paperwork
To all the paperwork, that I didn't return
Tough choices, we all live and we learn
Yeah my man got a raise, but he still underpaid
He gotta work like a slave like he ain't good enough
But he went in today, put a smile on his face
and made an old lady's day, now that's lookin up

[Chorus]
