[Chorus 1: Big K.R.I.T. - singing]
I'm going live (forever and ever and ever)
Ahhhh (forever and ever and ever)
From the underground (from the underground)
From the underground (from the underground)
I'm going live (forever and ever and ever)
Ahhhh (forever and ever and ever)
From the underground (from the underground)
From the underground (from the underground)

[Big K.R.I.T. - singing] + {Ms. Linnie}
When I'm gone (when I'm gone)
Just be strong (just be strong)
You're not alone {you're not alone}
I'm going home {I'm going home}
Carry on {carry on}
Carry on {carry on}
Carry on {carry on}
Carry on {carry on}

[Chorus 1]

[Big K.R.I.T. - singing]
All I can say... *hums*
All I can say is... *hums*

Yeah I know it's hard
This world will let you down one day, down one day
Just let down your guard
I'll pick you up if you're round my way, if you're round my way
Call my name
Free your chains, a-ayyye
Call my name
Free your chains, a-ayyyyye...

I gotta get a move on (I gotta get, I gotta get a move on)
I gotta get a move on, yeah (I gotta get, I gotta get a move on)
I gotta get a move on (I gotta get, I gotta get a move on)
I gotta get a move on, yeah (I gotta get, I gotta get a move on)

They say the train still coming, it won't be long
Only good Lord knows my wrongs
Trouble is the damn Devil won't leave me alone
No time to waste, I gotta pay my dues
Lord, my problems seem to come in twos
All these miles I walked, I can't feel my shoes

[Chorus 2: Big K.R.I.T. - singing]
I'm going live, ahhhh
From the underground
From the underground
I'm going live, ahhhh
From the underground
From the underground
