[Intro: Solomon Childs]
Yeah, word...
Godfather shit... you know?
Take your mind off it (yeah, what?)

[Solomon Childs]
My projects, this the funeral homes and Laundromats
Hall of fame, for niggas who hit off gats
Late comer, ain't turned ghetto since fourteen
In the hood it's only money that the drop bring
Solomon King, and when the toast ring
You know I know, you yellow back niggas'll run
Talkin' shit, is like walkin' wet on the third rail
My fault for hurtin' ya'll sales
About to party like I'm Bobby Rail
Cop grams off a Dominican in the well
Fifth borough, marquise, livin' New York soap operas
I see more drug dealers than doctors
Neglect, hold a ratchet, but to Allah I'm still innocent
I keep correspondin', wit thugs who needs witnesses
Uncle Wise, 21st century

[Chorus 2X: Solomon Childs]
Ghetto celebrities, penitentiary bars
Jealousy, guns, jigga spot number runs
Criminals and deceased stars
Look around you, son, who wouldn't get high

[Remedy]
We make music, til the wee hours of morn'
These grays in my beard grow as time goes on
Nothin' like the feeling, when you're hearin' our song
The best things in life just don't last long
Can't believe it, even little Barbara's gone
Wifey cries everyday, but tries to be strong
We all do things we no is dead wrong
Can't get it where you fit in, if you don't belong
Wait for no man, make moves for delf
You can't understand, I write songs for self
Seen misery and company, along with wealth
The real jewel is happiness and good health
Know cats that had money and now they're dead broke
Straight up clean kids, who now smoke coke
Smokin' up cigarettes and died of a stroke
What used to be respected, now is a joke

[Chorus]

[Remedy]
21st century, my suggestion to you is to Remedy
If you don't know your enemy, then you're already dead
Rest in peace, God bless, the realest shit said (life)

[Solomon Childs]
Last intermission, Body Brighton thrill-ogy
Stressed out momma, Stephanie Mills
Project black house, sell crack to pay bills
New York crime scene, narcotic crime kings
Chicks with the Chinese doobies, gold diggers wit the tight cooties
Searchin' up the candy wit the big booties
Draw part headed, hard headed growin' up
And hard head will make a soft ass
Rock pool old sneakers to class
Introductions, the building of a plateau
Playin' dominoes wit the beer hoes
I thought Pink and B.D., be here forever
I thought Sandy Brock would play basketball forever
I thought Storm Fields would always give the weather
Momma said "never say never"

[Chorus 2X]

[Outro: Solomon Childs]
Life, and that's the way it is
Solemnly swear, to always tell the truth
Tell you what I see...
That's what I'm here fore, autobiography
Life... Solomon marked for life, Solomon, Solomon
Solomon marked for life, Solomon, Solomon
Solomon marked for life, Solomon, Solomon...</pre>
