we just gon get fuckin high
we ain't got nothing to do its friday
we ain't no job
All my niggaz get ya weed
Go get all ya Phillies
No White Owls go get them Dutchies
And shit like that
And lets get high on this one
And all niggaz get drunk too
Cause i get drunk too
I'm a drunk man
Thats right, know what I mean?
who got that liqour
Lets get fuckkkkkkkedddd up!!!

Chorus: Noreaga (repeat 2X)

Smoke weed nigga and let me see y'all smoke
And get high nigga and let me hear y'all choke
And drink some hennesay nigga
And you can mix it with coke
I hit the bar up with cream and wont leave till I'm broke

--=={1ST VERSE}==--
Aiyyo I'm half baked
Half of my brain done baked
Married to marijuana, yo she got a fat ass
But know I fuck with her sister 
Yo her name black hash
we have menaj in the car kid and still don't crash
Cousin Heineken had me flipping and dippin
I hate that bitch but you I'm still sippin
I'm in Corona now
I fuck with ayo I fuck with Hennea Seya and Theresa
Flew us out of town kid, charge it to the VISA
we all drunk up fucked up and smoked out too
Sometimes I get so high I think I do kung-fu
Straight sneeze on niggaz 
Like ha-choo, disrespect they food
Thought I told em I'm rude
Coke head niggaz try to sober up in the new
I went to Philly smoked weed with Red and Meth
It was Phillie after Phillie then still acting silly then 
Last Phillie wasnt even in Philly
 
Chorus

Bridge: Noreaga

Do the drunk man nigga
Do the drunk man
Do the drunk man nigga
Do the drunk man
Do the drunk man nigga
Do the drunk man
Do the drunk man nigga
Do the drunk man

--=={2ND VERSE}==--
I guess I explain
Smoke green straight to the brain
Marijuana ain't a drug it's just like your chick
You gotta understand it
Then fuck your bitch, fuck whatever else nigga, just fuck the bitch
I get real nice
while y'all niggaz fuck with detox
I smoke weed on my way to the weed spot
wassup y'all ain't nothing wrong with that
I rather you smoke on weed than smoke on gats
I ain't a role model nigga but i model my raps
If I could do it all over still live in Iraq
I probably come back and try to save my man Killa Black
I save my bloody money kid and bring it to laundromats
Get High
Chill High
Real High
I Make the Judge and jury just comply with I
Get right up in ya business nigga like I was a private eye
FBI
