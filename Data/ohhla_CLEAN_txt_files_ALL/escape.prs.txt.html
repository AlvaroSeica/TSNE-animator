"I'm saying to you, that you will in a few minutes,
 hear, from the man, who is taking the place,
 of real black leadership, who will answer the call,
 for true freedom, justice, and equality in America.
 Well now, do you understand?" {*applause*}

[Paris]
Brethern heed the call of enlightenment
Of truth, Asiatic discipline's frightenin
some who act dumb embraced by decadence
The weak in the wake of true black militants
Hear the call and all heed the savior
Praise Allah cause in his energy made ya
the cream, Asiatic earth-born manchild
Freedom's comfort for some but meanwhile
Young brothers just don't realize
Cocaine's the plan, the devil derived
Produced and let loose to youth for profit
Fake so-called negroes won't stop it
Witness lies fed straight to the brotherman
Hopes are lost to the malevolent gameplan
Annihilation of original citizens
of this great planet Earth - listen
P-Dog spits the dope words born
Batterram's rollin task force swarm
Pigeons squawk with the talk of a new high
Controlled by the man whose plan is genocide
Intense is a sense of ignorance
When the wack can't get with the pro-black
program that's designed to enduce thought
Rhymes ya bought keep Panthers taught
Punks stay put, skinheads are flatfoot
Keys are played as I stay on route
Down the path of the righteous chosen
Word is born as the wack stay frozen
Locked in time, mindset is Babylon
P's the martyr while MC's babble on
Letter sixteen is me and some see
I freeze and snuff MC's like pipe dreams
Makin a mark with the start of the movement
Tracks in fact weak wack can't do this
Tooth decay cause the fake been snozin
Lead the lost and the cost is you've been
freed from lies by the wise new messenger
P-A-R-I-S is a blessin ya
can't underestimate or recreate
The sounds of Scarface, let the man BREAK!

"There is no in-between - you are either free or you're a slave.
 There's no such thing as second-class citizenship." {*applause*}

"The only politics in this country that's relevant to black people
 today is the politics of revolution.  None other." {*applause*}

[Paris]
Which brings us to the next move - it's a simple case of
show and tell or rather show and prove
Of made up gank moves and foolish fairy tales
said by sissies, to snatch the record sales
So when you see me just say I told ya
My rhymes'll hold ya and mold ya to soldiers
And train your brains with the pride and the insight
to do what's right, yo black, it's yo' life!
Once upon a time called now we start this
A chosen one came forth from the darkness
To lead the lost for the cost of a beat tape
And make the blind see straight 'fore it's too late
I can't wait time's quickly runnin out
Call to arms, revolution's in the house
Unforgettable the words of wisdom
Brought to life by the ten point system

* ONE: Freedom and power to determine our destiny
* TWO: Full employment for the black community
* THREE: Fight the capitalist with a raised fist
P.U.I. black and stack awareness
* FOUR: Decent housing for the shelter of human beings
* FIVE: Education and truth for the black youth
* SIX: All black men exempt from military service
Hear my words and get nervous
* SEVEN: A quick end to police brutality
Death of blacks at the hands of the P.D.
* EIGHT: Release of all black men who are held in prison;
guilty 'fore proven innocent
* NINE: Black juries when our brothers are tried in court
And in addition to all his we want
* TEN: Land bread and housing and education
Clothing justice and peace for the black nation</pre>
