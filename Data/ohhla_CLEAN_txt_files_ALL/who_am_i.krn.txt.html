Typed by: Lil Hustle

(*talking*)
Yeah, nobody's perfect uh
Who am I

[K-Rino]
Ain't no commrottery, envy and jealousy dividing me
And rose the killer exposed, the afterworld side of me
Those I probably, confided and lied inside of me
For years, constantly evaluated me improperly
I teach game, like people taught it to me
My personality might not be, what you thought it could be
See it's easy to walk with me, when it's sunny and warm
But how many people gon stay down, through the cold and the storm
Am I perfect, I'll be the first to tell you I ain't
Just because I try to kick knowledge, don't make me a saint
Now who am I, I'm not the man you think you know
I'm trying to get up out the quicksand, 'fore I sink too low
I'm educated by the streets man, I done took my class
Trying to maintain, but the rap game done whooped my ass
The only part of me you know, is what I show you
But internally family and friends, can't even fathom what I go through

[Hook]
Now who am I, only a man just like you
I wrestle with myself, to figure out what I must do
Fuck knocking on a do', I'm trying to bust right through 
So don't put me on no pedestal, I'm just like you
Now who am I, only a man just like you
I'm still struggling, ain't no telling what I just might do
Fuck knocking on a do', I'm trying to bust right through
So don't put me on no pedestal, I'm just like you

[K-Rino]
They say it helps to open up, it makes the soul feel good
Soon as you do it, people spread your bidness all through the hood
Living without love made hatred, the main thang that I thought of
And I done did a lot of things in the past, that I ain't proud of
I don't give women the respect, they deserve
I never hit one with my hands, but I've abused em with words
Many days I would, write lyrics to raise my hood
But I'm certain that my bad side, outweighs my good
I'm getting so tired of thinking, till my mind won't run
I'm getting tired of people telling me, that my time gon come
Maybe I suffer, cause of temptation I never resisted
Maybe my time already came, and I ain't know it and missed it
It ain't wise to share your dreams, with everybody know why
Cause even close friends, will wish negative thoughts in the sky
And when I see a arrogant hoe, I squeeze his lid
I run with the thugs and the sinners, like Jesus did

[Hook]

[K-Rino]
God gives heaven to me, and other than he there never will be
One who can definitely say he knows who I am, better than me
Two things take place, when struggling starts
It either brings you closer together, or further apart
If I leave nothing behind, after the graveyard got me
Y'all gon mourn two or three weeks, then forget all about me
You out of sight you out of mind, once your heartbeat quit
And you can never be remembered, if you ain't did shit
Give you my last if I got it, ain't no greed in my bones
Last of my bloodline, I never had a seed of my own
I feel depression, cause it wasn't my intention to see
The next generation be born, with no extension of me
But hopefully, I can keep living on this earth through
The parts of my life that I write down, and give birth to
I ain't fraud but see, being right is hard to be
Excuse my evil side, just focus on the God in me

[Hook]
Now who am I, only a man just like you
I chase money, ain't no telling what I just might be
I get aggravated commit sins, and lust like you
So don't put me on no pedestal, I'm just like you
Now who am I, only a man just like you
I wrestle with myself, to figure out what I must do
Fuck knocking on a do', I'm trying to bust right through
So don't put me on no pedestal, I'm just like you

(*talking*)
Yeah homie, I'm working on myself
Just like you working on yourself man, you know
We gotta minister to eachother man, and try to pull eachother up
So uh when you see me, don't look at me as being no better than you are man
Cause it might be something that you can give me, that I don't have
So remember I'm just like you, yeah feel that</pre>
