[Rob Jackson]
Yo, yo yo
I hit rap like, fiends hit the crack pipe
Beef in these streets but the beats make me act right
I don't sleep on these "quick-to-pull-the-gat" types
Cuz right when you blink, they'll squeeze and hold the mac tight
I write like Richard but Light still kiss ya good night
Hand on the swivel when I'm pitchin my dice
I'm might come out on the block, with my vest but keep glancin
So God Bless, I could live to see my grandson
[Boom, boom, boom] Playa you feel that?
That's the speakers beatin in the trunk where the wheel at
Pitch kept me sittin on a hit, with a ill track
So I gotta give it to him, spit it to him, real rap
I feel ya nigga [boom, boom, boom]
I gotcha gut workin - bout to make a dub
and bump it for the next person [boom, boom, boom]
That's how we workin, it's okay in L.A.
Is on the three-way singin it (holla at me!)

[Chorus]
Boom, boom, boom
[Rob] We got it poppin, some hits droppin
[Rob] we bout to knock 'em in ya ear like [boom, boom, boom]
[May] In the clubs, drops and trucks
[May] divas and thugs, keep it goin like [boom, boom, boom]
[Rob] Lady May and Rob Jackson, Arista-Crattin'
[Rob] bout to blow like [boom, boom, boom]
[Rob] We bout to (what what) hit 'em with the (what what)..

[Lady May]
Hoppin out the new condition, Expedition
With the fo' systems, me and my vixens [boom, boom, boom]
Yeah, that's exactly how we enter the room
Ka-Boom! Lookin fine-tuned
Mmm-mmm delicious, sexy switchers
Big witches, tasty as bait to big fishes
Whole blastses of Cris's with froze wristses (uh-huh)
Blow kisses, when we get catty we throw hisses
So ridiculous, walk when you look at this
Know we better not miss, it coulda been you, we not pimpin nuttin
Bourgieous broad, a movie star
That remains so *tssss* you can't cool her off [boom, boom, boom]
Beats is knockin, hit songs droppin, keep on rockin
Arista-Cats, I'm feelin that
Lady May and Rob Jack' it's a rap

[Chorus]
Boom, boom, boom
[Rob] We got it poppin, some hits droppin
[Rob] we bout to knock 'em in ya ear like [boom, boom, boom]
[May] In the clubs, drops and trucks
[May] divas and thugs, keep it goin like [boom, boom, boom]
[Rob] Lady May and Rob Jackson, Arista-Crattin'
[Rob] bout to blow like [boom, boom, boom]
[Rob] We bout to (what what) hit 'em with the (what what)
[Rob] E'rybody say it!

[Rob Jackson]
Yo, I'm like the black rap Sandy Koufax cuz I'm a throwback cat
that crack collars and yack like "where the 'dro at?"
Deez niggaz know dat - Rob go hard with the Kojak
Up in the side, gettin some blowback
Hold that, that's slow rap - buddy you ain't robbin goody
I'm gold-grill smilin, whippin cutties on the silent scene
Do it up, who want it? Niggaz from Kentucky who be jeweled up
Jumpin out they junkies lookin country, holla
to what whenever, to fuckin clever
With this rap shit for you to ever touch my level
Mastered the flow, it's ventin me like Hennessey
But when you feelin me, you drink it fast like it's Mo'
Nasty, gas that new ass in the fo'
But feelings make me realer than the illest nigga though
They be thinkin that they killers, cuz they slit a nigga throat
I'm politickin with guerrilla niggaz, still a nigga folk like
G. Dub Bush, and cheet-ah pushin
Benzes in the caravan, grams in the cushion
American black weighed in, we on the pavement
Even though they callin us thugs, we gon' make it! (Holla at me!)

[Chorus] - 2X
Boom, boom, boom
[Rob] We got it poppin, some hits droppin
[Rob] we bout to knock 'em in ya ear like [boom, boom, boom]
[May] In the clubs, drops and trucks
[May] divas and thugs, keep it goin like [boom, boom, boom]
[Rob] Lady May and Rob Jackson, Arista-Crattin'
[Rob] bout to blow like [boom, boom, boom]
[Rob] We bout to (what what) hit 'em with the (what what)
[Rob] E'rybody say it! [boom, boom, boom]</pre>
