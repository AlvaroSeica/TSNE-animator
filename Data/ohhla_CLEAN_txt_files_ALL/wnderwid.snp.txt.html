[Intro: Uncle Chucc]
I wonder, wonder, wonder what it do
(I wonder, wonder, wonder what it do)
Wonder, wonder, wonder what it do
(I wonder, wonder, wonder what it do)

[Uncle Chucc]
They say it circulates, sixty-four on Vogues
In the game, pain still the same, they knockin at your do's
Ooohh you wonder what it's all about (what it's all about)
It's a sad sad thang, you dirty low down

[Chorus: Uncle Chucc]
(Oooooh-hoo) I wonder
(I wonder, wonder, wonder what it do) Sooo!
(Oooooh-hoo)
(I wonder, wonder, wonder what it do) Oooh!

[Interlude: Uncle Chucc]
La-la-la, la, la-la-la
La-la-la-lahhhhh - won't you tell me now!
La-la-la, la, la-la-la
La-la-la-lahhhhh - pleeeeease!
La-la-la, la, la-la-la
La-la-la-lahhhhh - won't you tell me now!
La-la-la, la, la-la-la
La-la-la-lahhhhh - Snoop Dogg!

[Snoop Dogg]
Independent, I'm in it, been gettin my cash right
Walkin through the daytime holdin my flashlight
Spliffted, high as I could ever be
I'm lifted, driftin on the memory
My style, my tone, my delivery
My +Maze+ is +Frankie Beverly+
Heavily influenced; I do it, like you cain't
I'm the weed to the zag, with the bag of the drank
Get live, that's five on the blackhand side
Now try to, stay fly with a piece of pie
I heard fish don't burn in the kitchen
The baby gangsters they in the hood and on a mission
Uhh, you bump 'em up, they fuck it up
Now what you need to do, is toughen up
Now thug it up, what it do dawg?
I thought you wanted to be like Big (Snoop Dogg)

[Chorus: Uncle Chucc]
(Oooooh-hoo) Ahhhh
(I wonder, wonder, wonder what it do)
Wonder, wonder, wonder what it do~!!
(Oooooh-hoo) Tell me!!
(I wonder, wonder, wonder what it do)

[Snoop Dogg]
When I get lost (when I get lost)
I feel like a boss (feel like a boss)
She will be myyy, salvation
And when I feel lost (I feel lost)
With nowhere to go (nowhere to go)
She'll be my inspiration
She never spends (she never spends)
Time with her friends (nu-uh, nu-uh)
Tells me she's blue, without me
And when things go wrong (yeah)
Her faith is strong
I know that she'll never doubt me

[Outro: Uncle Chucc] + (singers) + {Snoop}
HEY, SNOOP DOGG!
(Oooooh-hoo) {What it do, what it do?}
(I wonder, wonder, wonder what it do) {G'yeah}
Wonder, wonder, wonder what it do {I wonder what it do}
(Oooooh-hoo) {Ye-yeh ye-yeah! Yeah, I wonder what it do}
(I wonder, wonder, wonder what it do)
{Get your groove on, uhh, yeah}
La-la-la, la, la-la-la
La-la-la-lahhhhh
La-la-la, la, la-la-la
La-la-la-lahhhhh
La-la-la, la, la-la-la
La-la-la-lahhhhh
La-la-la, la, la-la-la
