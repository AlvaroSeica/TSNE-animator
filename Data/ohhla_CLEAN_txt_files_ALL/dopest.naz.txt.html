[Bronze Nazareth]
Yeah, Yeah, Word up
Bronzeman get your verses murdered, Then I sip the bourbon
Mic sit on blue fire, Blood sweat and live wire
Fly niggas from the bottom, Got up and shot one
Octane, Plot til your knot spun
Run around tracks like Jesse Owens with Human Growth Hormones
Burying bones in Marion Jones's ozones
Flat line, Outline mics in black chalk seven times
Sever Devil's spines, I keep ??? the treasure several times
Pocketed dimes, Rocket rap racketeering
Probably yapping, Do a act of disappearing
Bury you next door under the water floor
Where the crack smoke will carry you to Hell's fifth ward
Ziploc raw skunk you can smell from Texas to Florida
Not begging you for revenue, I'd rather pop up and pop two
Shells in your mineral spirit
Got ties to killers who played Monopoly series
Who the dopest, Call the canines
Fools is hopeless, Dreaming of grave signs
Come in the door and lick the brownie five times
Throw lines like Charles Bronson pull knives
Swing at dark jungles, Art rumbles through the mind
Part fades, Like Moses in the Red Sea
Specialist quick quoting, The rescue too deadly
Let em die, All bets aside
Body floating in the Detroit River high noon July
Black Day like the clouds is made of crack day
We the dopest, Raw black tar heroin tracks
Scare air when it hits, The Moon lunar eclipse
I'll low reimage your clips, I wrote Hemmingway scripts
Bodies float to Heaven leave the slow to witness
Rap Massacre Day and tight rope fitness
Meth heads get clean off one sniff
Of the dope shit I provoke, Stroke the heart wondress
One fifth in my lung sip gun metal from the Brunswick
Til it's done smoke Bronze blunts with the berry or the honey dip

[Hook 6X: unknown singer]
As a matter of fact the dopest niggas you ever wanted to fuck with</pre>
