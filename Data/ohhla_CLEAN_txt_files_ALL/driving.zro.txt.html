It's a Big E beat...
 
[Hook]
It's that pretty brown round, driving me wild
Ooh bitch, your pussy's bout to get a little greasier
And the KY make penetrating, so much easier (easier) - 2x
But I wish you wouldn't trust me so much
 
[Z-Ro]
That don't mean I'ma cheat on ya
I'ma bend that ass over and beat on ya, then I'ma skeet on ya
Damn right, I'm a boss and you know that
When I leave the pad, I can't wait until I go back
The bed too fed baby, smarter than a mo'fucker
Go on show me, what you got up in your head baby
Hell naw, I don't need no X
Just a rain coat baby, cause it's bout to get wet
Got you begging me to stop, but I ain't finished yet
Guaranteed this a fucking, you will never forget
Yeah so many bitches, I got to like one
So many cigarillos, I got to light one 
You ain't even gotta wonder, if you doing something wrong
Cause it's all on bitch, you got the right one
 
[Hook] 
 
[Z-Ro] 
Cause I'm in love, with all your friends
And I don't wanna do ya like that baby, but your homegirl giving me a call again
Whenever she spend the night
You let her walk around the house, in her panties and bra again
When y'all go to sleep, in the living room
She end up in the bedroom, sucking on my balls again
But I don't feel bad, cause you ain't my girl
Nothing but a sex thang, that's all it ever was 
I knew you was a freak, cause we fucked in the club
Pussy got wet, when you saw the swangas on dubs
I'm a thug from around the way, like Slim Thug
And I need pussy, like a dopefiend need drugs
Mike Moe got a pint, we gon' po' it on up
Looking for a few bitches, that'll skeet on us
 
[Hook] 
 
[Z-Ro]
Uh, cause you already know I'm a dog
And even though I'm house trained mayn
I just can't keep, my third leg in my draws
I try to do right, but everytime it get hard
I break my chain, and end up in my neighbor yard
I'm a pitbull baby, you a shitzu
I'm a freak you a freak, ain't no telling what we get into
I'm trying to win trying to not to sin, high off weed and lots of gin
Go on spread eagle for me, I'ma drop it in
Trying to knock the lining, out the cock again
I'ma bang the game up, so don't be playing with me
Hop up in my B-E-D
Slow down, I'm about to skeeeet yeeeah
 
[Hook] 
 
[Z-Ro] 
Baby, show me some I.D.
Fine as a motherfucker, but you might be sixteen 
And I ain't trying to end up, in the penitentiary
You gon' be screaming, daddy take some of that dick up out of me
When you in the strip club, you work that pole 
When you in the bedroom, you work that pole
I ain't choosy baby, you can work me fast or you can work me slow
When I be up in the stripclub, I be tipping 
Be rack after rack, big ham think I'm tripping
I'm hood rich, this ain't nothing but good living
Your bitch chose me, and I ain't even pimping
