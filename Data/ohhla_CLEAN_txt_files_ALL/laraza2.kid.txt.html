It's all goin down this year
My Lac's in gear and I wiped off my tattoo tears
A lot of things have changed since '90
I got a lot more homeboys and gente behind me
And this time you just can't stop it
No tellin' what might happen
When your kids get a copy of the '95 remix
We in the casa, we did it for La Raza
Because it's all brand new, it's updated
You see my Cherokee's a Lac
And my spokes are gold plated
I'm hitting side to side
There's a lump in my throat
But I just can't swallow my Brown Pride
I'm like an eagle with a snake in his mouth
And a brown fist represents Frost in the house
Coming back hard on the rap scene
It's all about the red, white, and green
Yeah

[Chorus: Rich Garcia (Frost)]
If you're chicano and you're brown and proud
It's your kind of music
(This is for the Raza)
And If you're down for your neighborhood
It's your kind of music
(Chicano, and I'm brown and I'm proud)

Here I go again, and I'm bound to win
Because I'm proud of the color of my skin
You see I'm kinda like De La Hoya
I'm filled with the spirit of an Aztec Warrior
And that means you better not mess with me
This is Frost, the capital E-S-E
I'm hitting switches like back in the video
I'm that same fool that you seen five years ago
I still cruise, I paid my dues
And the only thing new is some more tattoo
It's that Mexican sound, that makes it brown
I'm stomping in my Nikes and I'm all creased down
Out in El Paso, up through Chicago
Even in Manhattan they begging for a Latin
Cities like Miami is waiting for another jam
I rocked Mexico but called it the Motherland
Yeah

[Chorus]

Man, I think I came up with a solution
And the answer is Brown Revolution
So pump your fist to this
And wave your Mexican flag
And be proud that your khaki's sag
I'm here to set the record straight
And clean up the slate
All player haters headed upstate
They hate to see me bouncing through East Los
Or cooling in my house on the hill on the West Coast
Or hanging with the veterano OG's
And hearing all the stories of the '70's
Like how the boulevard used to be
And how they had values in '73
But now I'm living in a new era
And surviving in the '90's is sheer terror
Some of you don't know what's happening, Â¿Que pasa?
It's 1996 and this is still for La Raza

[Chorus x2]</pre>
