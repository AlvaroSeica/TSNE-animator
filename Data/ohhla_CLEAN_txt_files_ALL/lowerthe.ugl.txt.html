[Andy Cooper]
Make it boom!
Here we go!

[Andy Cooper and Dizzy Dustin]
Listen as the track makes your backbone snap
When it's bangin out your speaker so your hat's blown back
Einstein let the drums beat down to the bedrock
Red hot, Dizzy put the mic in a headlock

[Dizzy Dustin]
Light the dynamite, pull the pin from the grenade
Enter the stockade and break down the barricade
Bring in the brigade, let's start the crusade
Take no prisoners, we've got listeners to save
Launch the air raid, the troops are ready to invade
Attack the airwaves until our record is played
We've got "Bang for the Buck till "The End of Time"
So "Slow The Flow" or get "Left Behind"

[Chorus: Ugly Duckling]
Ears, mouth, eyes and nose
Overload your senses with the highs and lows
We are on a mission that'll cover the map
So, be advised that your under attack
Look out below, we're gonna lower the boom
Call crowd control, we're gonna lower the boom
Cause now you know, we're gonna lower the boom
She's about to blow, we're gonna lower the boom
Make it boom...
Make it boom...
Make it boom...
Make it boom...

[Andy Cooper and Dizzy Dustin]
Your heartbeat skips and your window shakes
From the drum breaks and the 808's
Note, the panic starts when we march through your area
Andy Cooper (what) break the sound barrier

[Andy Cooper]
Blasting off like an astronaut
Cause my rap can rock like an aftershock
As I sneak into the cave while you hibernate
And hit you with raw rhythm till so wide awake
Surprise, I'm on the rise like a bad moon
As the boom cuts deeper than a stab wound
I'm going fifteen rounds with the heavyweights
And I won't stop throwing blows till the levy breaks

[Chorus: Ugly Duckling]
Ears, mouth, eyes and nose
Overload your senses with the highs and lows
We are on a mission that'll cover the map
So, be advised that your under attack
Look out below, we're gonna lower the boom
Call crowd control, we're gonna lower the boom
Cause now you know, we're gonna lower the boom
She's about to blow, we're gonna lower the boom
Make it boom...
Make it boom...
Make it boom...
Make it boom...

[Andy Cooper and Dizzy Dustin]
Ears, mouth, eyes and nose
Overload your senses with the highs and lows
Ears, mouth, eyes and nose
Overload your senses with the highs and lows
Ears (ears), mouth (mouth), eyes and nose
Overload your senses with the highs and lows
Ears (ears), mouth (mouth), eyes and nose (Thats right)
Overload your senses with the highs and lows

[Andy Cooper]
Yeah, got the boom
UD, thats it

[People Under The Stairs]
Yo, man, what you think about these guys, man?
   Who's that, man?
Ugly Duckling, man
   Oh yeah, them dudes, they, they cool
   I don't know, "Fresh Mode" was dope
   You know, that was hot
I loved it when they was Meatshakin
   Yeah, I know you liked that
