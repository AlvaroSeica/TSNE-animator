[Intro - Classified - talking]
Hello?
Hello?
HELLO???

[Chorus - Sample from "No Reply At All" by Genesis] (Classified)
Is anybody listening? Ohhh
(Yeah, can you hear me?)
No reply at all
(Ha, come on)
Is anybody listening?
Ohhh
(One, two, one, two)
No reply at all
(Yeah)
Is anybody listening? Ohhh
(What do I got to do to make you pay attention?)
No reply at all
(Yeah, uh)

[Verse 1 - Classified]
Now, this is, more than a business
Much more than a kid tryin to get rich
Live this like it's an addiction
Spit this whether anybody listens
I don't know if you really hearin me
But these lyrics seem to be my therapy
Guaranteed, I hear the beat
My stress gets released, 'til I feel at peace
And I feel pretty fortunate
Even though I never made a fortune yet
A lot of these cats who try to make it in rap
They get nothin back
No feedback their whole life
Somethin to say with no mic
Incredible skill but no hype
I spit it for the ones never heard
Who spend everyday tryin to make this work, but

[Chorus - Sample from "No Reply At All" by Genesis] (Classified)
Is anybody listening?
(Is anybody listening?)
Ohhh
No reply at all
Is anybody listening?
Ohhh
(One, two, one, two)
No reply at all

[Verse 2 - Classified]
Yeah, uh, okay, here we go again
Roll the weed20and put your stereo to ten
You know what you got in your boombox bangin
Unorthodox like "Boondock Saints" is
Take notes on how I stay dope
Upgrade the flow and keep the fake out
Bend the example play the scapegoat
But I shoot to get high, your goal to aim LOW!
Now could I take attendance
And give props to those who pay attention?
Listen to the flow and the way that we blend it
When we creatin and then we did it all independent
But come on, it only take a minute
Same old Class with a Yankee fitted
Still Enfield, never change your digits
I'm good where I'm at, don't hate just listen, come on

[Chorus - Sample from "No Reply At All" by Genesis] (Classified)
Is anybody listening?
(Is anybody listening?)
Ohhh
(Huh?)
No reply at all
Is anybody listening?
Ohhh
No reply at all

[Break - DJ scratches for 15 seconds]

Yeah, one, two, one, two

[Verse 3 - Classified]
Look, this is more than beats and hooks
Thieves and crooks or reading books
More than gettin lifted, with your boy twisted
Friday night at the club double fistin
This shit's a way of life
I know it's clich√© but my DJ say I'm right
We eat and breathe this, without a recess
Always on the mind like priests with Jesus
Playin it out, get strategic
Write my life like a thesis
I break this down into pieces
Nope no fluke, work hard to achieve this
Beat bang but still I speak
And spit with substance that will=2
0fill my needs
Treat hip hop like it's my religion
So yeah I'm sincere, thank you for listening

[Chorus - Sample from "No Reply At All" by Genesis] (Classified)
Is anybody listening?
(Huh?)
Ohhh
No reply at all
Is anybody listening? Ohhh
(One, two, one, two)
No reply at all

Is anybody listening?  Ohhh
(Can you hear that?  Ha)
There's no reply at all
(I can't hear ya, nah I can't hear ya)
Is anybody listening?
Ohhh
No reply at all
(Uh, yeah, I can't hear ya, I, I can't hear ya)

[Outro - DJ scratches until fade] - w/ ad libs</pre>
