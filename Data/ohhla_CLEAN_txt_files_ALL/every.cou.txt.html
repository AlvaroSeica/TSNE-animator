chorus (2x):
everybody put/throw your lighters up

[Boots]
Every death is an abrupt one
Every cop is a corrupt one
without no cash up in the trust fund
Every cat wit a gat wanna bust one
Every guest want a plus-one
Every tenement's a penitent
Every tried man is innocent
Time served should be the cent spent
Everybody wanna hear the lick
Every one a y'all is getting pimped
Every time i spit i'm feelin ripped
Every cancer is a homicide
Every boss better run and hide
Every human is some kin to Black
Every Visa got a pin to crack
Every verse is from the cardiac
Every search is involuntary
Every inmate want commisary
Every bank note is promissory
Every broke motherfucker finna form a gang
and when we come we takin everything.

chorus (2x):

[Boots]
Every mack want a cadillac
Every mark want they scrilla back
Every narc want a hit of crack
In the park or a pontiac
Every little cent is to the rent
Every roach is a resident
Every truth ain't evident
Every slave story, present tense
Every [??up lies??] a consequence
Every time it be something sweet
Every banker is a fuckin thief
Everybody betta holla wit me
Every fiend need a dolla fifty
Every crime that i do is petty
Every criminal is rich already
Every lender got a complex
Every single is a bomb threat
Every sellout, may ya hate my verse
Everybody, they gon' get it first
Every broke motherfucker finna form a gang
and when we come we taking everything
