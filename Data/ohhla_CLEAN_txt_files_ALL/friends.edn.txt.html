Yo, don't throw the beat on yet... throw it on, NOW!

This is Edaaaaaaaaaaan
In the place to be, in the place to be
In the place to do it, where we gots to do it, where we gots to do it
Just do it, just do it, check it out

The beat's gonna pause right now but I'm comin back in
I just wanna make friends, with MC's
Buy em ice cream
Take em to the park
Then we'll hang out
Go see the butterflies, look at the girl
She wants to give us, a toy
MCs....  do you wanna hang out?
Let's chill
Let's be friends
Let's chill
Let's be best friends
So we'll go to the movies
And we'll eat some pop corn
With butter on it
Then we'll go and rhyme
Freestyle a little bit in the park
Let's go hang out, go by the river
And rock some rhymes
MC, let's chill, let's be friends
Let's not fight
Let's just hang out all damn night
Let's just do it til the morning light
Let's just chill
Let's go walk around and talk about each others' problems
Let's go over and play some video games
At the arcade, you know, we just hang out
Yea, and we work on our rhymes
My metaphors are ok, how are yours?
Let's chill
Let's just be some friends
Cuz damn, I ain't got so many friends
I just wanna hang out, with MCs
Yo, they're like me
They write rhymes too
Let's hang out, you know what I wanna do
Just go to your crib
Just eat some ??? food
And then go your house whenever we want
Just hang out, yo, let's not fight
MCs, let's hang out all night
Let's do it
Let's chill, let's work it out
Let's do what we talked about
Let's get together, and help somebody
Let's plant a tree
Let's save the bees
Let's save the cats
Let's buy some cats
Let's eat some food together
Not a hot dog cuz you know that ain't clever
You don't wanna eat some junk food man
Yo, try this apple
Or this piece of broccoli, carrot, beta keratene
Yo, I won't act embarrassing
We'll just hang out
We'll just chill
MCs...
I wanna hang out with you, and you, and you, and yes, you
Go to someone's house or the zoo
Talk to the zebras and giraffes
They're so funny, don't make me laugh
MCs... ha ha ha, I wanna hang out</pre>
