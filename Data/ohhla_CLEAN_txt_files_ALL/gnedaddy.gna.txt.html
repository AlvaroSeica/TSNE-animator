[Verse I/IV]
Beautiful girl, lovely dress
High school smiles, oh yes
Beautiful girl, lovely dress
Where she is now, I can only guess

[Chorus]
'Cause it's gone, daddy gone
The love is gone
Yeah, it's gone, daddy gone
The love is gone
It's gone, daddy gone
The love is gone
Yeah, it's gone, daddy gone
The love is gone away

[Verse II/IV]
When I see you
Eyes will turn blue
When I see you
A thousand eyes turning blue

[Chorus]
'Cause it's gone, daddy gone
The love is gone
Yeah, it's gone, daddy gone
The love is gone
It's gone, daddy gone
The love is gone
Yeah, it's gone, daddy gone
The love is gone away


[Verse III/IV]
And I can tell by the way that you switch and walk
And I can see by the way that you - baby talk
And I can know by the way that you treat your man
I can love you baby, till it's a crying

[Chorus]
'Cause it's gone, daddy gone
The love is gone
Yeah, it's gone, daddy gone
The love is gone
It's gone, daddy gone
The love is gone
Yeah, it's gone, daddy gone
The love is gone away

[Verse IV/IV]
Beautiful girl, lovely dress
15 smiles, oh yes
Beautiful girl, lovely dress
Where she is now, I can only guess

[Chorus]
'Cause it's gone, daddy gone
The love is gone
Yeah, it's gone, daddy gone
The love is gone
It's gone, daddy gone
The love is gone
Yeah, it's gone, daddy gone
The love is gone away

[Outro]
Going away
Going away
Gone away
Going away
Going away
Gone away
Going away</pre>
