[Intro: Champ Diva]
Yeah, yo check it out
We got the Rocks The World niggas on this shit right here
We about to blaze the whole fucking industry
Ya'll ain't ready for this shit, yeah
We got my east coast niggas, my west coast niggas
We worldwide nigga, wha

[40 Glocc]
Half man and half animal
Half Afghanistan and part Taliban cannibal
Conceieved out of Bethlaham with no sperm doner
See we contagious like a virus when we spit germs on you
Sick like Pitbulls when they turn on you
And I rdie like a cowboy with six shooters on him
I whistle for my nigga, and the whip ??? on him

[Ill Knob]
Ill Knob from Klik Ga Blow, all ya'll could retire now
East coast, west coast, we got the fire now
Think you're higher now, you better recognize the sire now
Ya'll niggas fakin now, ya'll need to take it down
This the Knob, we come and got the ox and the rocks
My niggas role deep, homie, move from the block
Nigga we blast for the cash, splash for the cash
We got shorties on the corner sellin ass for the cash

[Champ Diva]
Yo, this is the inner cypher, don't make me have to fight ya
Quick to get up in your ass cuz I don't even like ya
These bitches got me hyper, maybe a lil vicious
Deadly Venom for sure, leaving ya death wishes
Oh you didn't know, though we about to blow blow
Me and my niggas come through in the low lows
Stylin from east to west coast, we shinin
Fill it in, Rocks The World, now ho you fuckin with?

[Chorus: Naisha]
Cuz it's a shame how niggas walk these streets
It ain't a game, you know the heat must be reached
And the pain is discreet, obtain what you eat
And you reep what you sow, breathe deep, breathe deep
Take a deep breathe, you fucking with the best
Ill Knob, 40 Glocc, boy you gambling with death
Watch yo damn step, Naisha collabin with the west
Riggamortis, K-Tray came to break the fucking neck

[K-Tray]
I'm from the city of them car jackers
west killa Cacilaca, stalkin cappers and blue raggers
On the block, no less then twelve on his waist
Disrespect the set, quick eject twelve in his face
I got them slugs runnin intersects, turning the corners
Hedges go, burn ya moments
Leave you stuck like sherm was on it
Bitch shit, I don't condone it
Actin a fit, attack like a wild pack of killer ???

[Riggamortis]
Hop out the Benz wagon, pants saggin, Timbs draggin
Rappers hear I'm in town, hide like Bin Laden
Hot to death, ain't no secret, I've been braggin
Try me with your hands, I shatter your chin pattern
My whole style tobassco, hot, who wanna taste it?
Consequence for fuckin with Rig, who wanna face it?
Ya'll basic cats don't wanna see, I'm hot lava
Spittin the top dollar, kid with the popped collar
Rig in this shit, holla

[Born]
Who figured that the fifth don't pop, some niggaz only play in the dark
Nigga I'll split ya braod day in the park
The blue light spit at you like you ain't hype
Have niggas kicken, boy you ain't right
Don't get me wrong, cuz I do that twice
And brush it off, like why'd you kill my baby? I had nothing else to do that night
And if you raised him right, it juts might've saved his life
Either that, or been trained for the fight
Bank for the whites, the eyes is a reminder to keep it tight
And never take nothin light
