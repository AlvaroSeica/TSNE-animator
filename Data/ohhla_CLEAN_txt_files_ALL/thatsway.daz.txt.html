[Intro - DJ E-Z Dick]
Here's a little somethin somethin to smoke to..
It's the DJ that's bringing you ain't nothing but
guaranteed classic hits, on the station that's..
serving you something real nice..It's W-Balls
and I am the DJ that's doing it to you one more time
in yo earhole, DJ E-Z.. Dick

[Verse 1 - Daz Dillinger]
What up to all my G's and G'zets
This right here gon be the sheiz-et
Who got the west coast sound that your always wantin'
Dogg Pound Gangstas, we still G-Funkin'
Let me know a little somethin
Cook up the bass now your trunk be subbin
Ridin down your block through your ave
License plates say Daz, 2005 tags
In a Chevy Tahoes on them 23s
From me to you, this is how we G's
From Frisko, to Oakland, back to Sac and North Bridgemen
Back to the P's where my boys be gettin' it
Where them D's keep spinnin' where we smoke that bud
Swervin' on 'em nigga like yo.. (whaddup cuzz!!)
It's a hood thang, go and represent it
and Diggy won't stop 'til the gangsta finish
I'm a menace to the funkadelic..
Death rollin it up, then take a puff and inhail it..

[Hook - Shorty B]
Can you feel it it's the realest..
'cause that's the way we ride..
You best behave yo'self if you come around..
It's Dogg Pound..

West coast, Dogg Pound
Gangstas, on the rise..
So if you come to Cali
Prepare to ride..and die

[Verse 2 - Daz Dillinger]
Now what you hear is not a test..
We G-Funkin to the beat..
We got the west coast type of gangsta music..
That make ya, move your feet..
Now keep it G with the D-A-Z
and when I'm in your town would you smoke for free?
Learn D-P-G-C-ology
and come on and get it, come ride with me
and dip in the old school Chevy..
The price real heavy let me know when your ready
It's all about the money, the scrilla, the fetti
I'm in the Bay with Juli and in LA with Feli!
and after the club it's the deli, I been known to bail it
Wake up the next morning with biscuits and jelly
Buy a quarter pound and I smoke with my friend
'cause for life, we gangstas, we settin a trend
After I get fresh, I'm at it again
7 grams in the swish, I'm back in the wind..

[Hook - Shorty B]
Can you feel it it's the realest..
'cause that's the way we ride..
You best behave yo'self if you come around..
It's Dogg Pound..

West coast, Dogg Pound
Gangstas, on the rise..
So if you come to Cali
Prepare to ride..and die

[Verse 3 - Daz Dillinger]
I'ma give it up, to them dogg pound fans
without y'all, I wouldn't be who I am
For 13 years for the sweat and the tears
Now I'm back with a new album to set the gear
In a V12 rock the bells like LL
I dream the well in a six when I fishscale
I burn rubber with my bay area thugs
Smokin on the catpis, that's all we smoke
Ain't a joke, take ya stride and ride
The realest nigga alive since 2pac died
I prey on the weak and I stride on the strong
From the eastside of the beach, where the G is strong
I still got it going on, girls on my line
and I won't waste yours, you don't waste mine
I'm a hustler, gangsta, pimp and all that
And when I'm actin' rappin my pockets so fat!

[Hook - Shorty B]
Can you feel it it's the realest..
'cause that's the way we ride..
You best behave yo'self if you come around..
It's Dogg Pound..

West coast, Dogg Pound
Gangstas, on the rise..
So if you come to Cali
Prepare to ride..and die</pre>
