[Intro] [Bishop talking]
Ahhh. Ha ha ha ha. Jeah, live and direct, somewhere over your motherfuckin' heads
It's your boy Bishop Lamont, Taje, Indef
You know what time it is. J1 on the boards
I'm drinkin' again! You know what we about (The Bizness)

[Verse One]
Deja Vu brah
Before I met her, I already knew her
Slutty dame, sexy thang, a peruah
A gymnast, loved to be flipped
Somersault with a twist
Could have won the gold at the Olympics
Sprinkle manure, I'm on that pimp shit
Never see my sweat
My game like Clear Stick
Yeah, I'm buff motherfucker but I ain't Melle Mel
Love makin' songs for the bitches, I guess I'm LL
But no mic on the arm, just an 18 tatted on my python
News flash, guess who L.A. got they eye on?
Little niggas talk big shit after you hop off my dick, hop back into your Scion
What's the fuss about?
Haters shut your mouth
Deep down inside, admit it, you just wanna hang out
Touch Dre's muscles, ride Aftermath's dick
You faggots talk about me more than my ex-bitch

[Chorus] 
Why you niggas all on me?
Want me?
Jealous fellas gossipin' like a bitch
Maybe it's cause you're lonely
And you want me
No thank you, faggots stay off my dick
Why you niggas all on me?
You don't don't know me
Fuck you niggas, y'all ain't shit
Momma always told me
Don't be
A playa hatin' punk ass bitch

[Verse Two] [Taje]
They say Taje is vicious
Stay gone off blunt and swishers
All it takes is one listen
To make your misses my mistress
I read the mayo on bitches
Y'all know I handle business
Known to knock out any rapper/producer or DJ senseless
Now bottoms up girl
No not them bottles girl
I love your face but that ass could be a model girl
I'm greedy and grotesque 
Free Scorpio till death
Never needed them jewels, my skin bright enough to shine it's damn self
When they gonna catch up to me?
When they gonna catch up to P?
Been a millennium ahead before we ever hooked up with the D.R.E.
That's why the money pilin'
That's why we be on islands
Y'all niggas talk away, I'm Andre 5000
We don't even need no toilets
That's what them rappers fo'
We shit on them take they music, wipe and roll
Then Mop &amp; Glo
The flow is cold, Antarctica, North Pole
When I drop
Timber, I'll let you know

[Chorus] 
Why you niggas all on me?
Want me?
Jealous fellas gossipin' like a bitch
Maybe it's cause you're lonely
And you want me
No thank you, faggots stay off my dick
Why you niggas all on me?
You don't don't know me
Fuck you niggas, y'all ain't shit
Momma always told me
Don't be
A playa hatin' punk ass bitch

[Verse Three] [Indef]
You force yourself to rap 
And long to hold to the mic
You niggas look like you carry Kotex and baby wipes
So put my nuts down
I'm sure they gettin' heavy
A few songs and now I'm charged like an Eveready
Clich√©, DJ Swine
And said I'm no good
And overlook my view like the hills in Hollywood
And niggas wish they was hard, maybe part of The Order
Until your Rover gets filled with holes the size of quarters
I'm no killer just a
Lost nigga for my
Safety, I'll skin ya alive like a chinchilla
I've been cold, you ain't nothin'
I live through the winter
I am what you ain't, I'm such a fuckin' nigga
Serious, I'm beyond the mix
And quick to get pumped up and start some shit
Inch by inch I fill the room
There's no more room on my dick so leave me alone

[Chorus] 
Why you niggas all on me?
Want me?
Jealous fellas gossipin' like a bitch
Maybe it's cause you're lonely
And you want me
No thank you, faggots stay off my dick
Why you niggas all on me?
You don't don't know me
Fuck you niggas, y'all ain't shit
Momma always told me
Don't be
A playa hatin' punk ass bitch</pre>
