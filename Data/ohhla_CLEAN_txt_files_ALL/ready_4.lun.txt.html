[Luni Coleone]
I'm out to make a mil nigga, so I'm ready for war, let's go
Hop in the low, let's jump
What the fuck you runnin' yo' mouth for?
It's Coleone bitch, I'm ready so what you gon' do?
I'm higher than your bedroom, 'bout to stick you like this tattoo
Make a move nigga, you opened them death threats
Better run and hide with your bitch, that'll see your best bet
I'm a psycho, aim for the head when the lead blow
One less nigga, one less stanky hoe
Now who can fuck with me?
The type of nigga that'll grab the gun and say you stuck with me
Got these niggaz up on the run, my bitch bust quickly
So spread out, I'm coming through - wit a pump
Mistakin' my size you best prepare for the funk
Cause I'm a hostile nigga, got my shit cocked
A false move might get yo' punk ass popped
It's Coleone and I'm ready for war
Tryin' to make these hoe cakes not breathe no more

[Chorus] - X2
I'm ready for war
Nigga hop out the lo, let's go
I'm ready for war
Nigga hop out the lo, let's go
I'm ready for war
Nigga hop out the lo, let's go
Roll down the window
Nigga, let the gat blow!

[Luni Coleone]
Think you niggaz better back up, I ain't playin' no more
Murder, murder on my mind I'm 'bout to even the score
And it's mando - to catch a nigga slippin' with his pants down
Creep up from the back and peel his cap with about four rounds
I'm furious nigga, these curious niggaz get took
For the own right, greedy ass niggaz must die
I'm a sold-ier, poppin' the pist-al to get my mil
Bitch you want some huh? Oh, you crazy as hell
They call me Coleone, and I can ???? my ??????
But I'm ready for war, let's go
Out the window of a Lexo, wit a .4-4
These niggaz don't wanna see me
I'm thugged out, chasin' yo' ass wit a tec-eezie
We kill 'em up -
I flash about my cash, like Ted Capone
Young hogs creep to the ????
When the funk is on, you better watch yo' back
Doja soldiers quick to fold ya, and I'm on the attack

[Chorus]
I'm ready for war
Nigga hop out the lo, let's go
I'm ready for war
Nigga hop out the lo, let's go
I'm ready for war
Nigga hop out the lo, let's go
Roll down the window
Nigga, let the gat blow!</pre>
