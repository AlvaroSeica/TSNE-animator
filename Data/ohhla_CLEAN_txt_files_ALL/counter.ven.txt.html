[Finesse]
All you counterfeiters, drum ridders, clowning niggas
Money getters, squeeze ya finger round the trigger, niggas
Wig splitters, fuckin buckin on ya little critics
Pussy hitters, fucking sucking my on my kitty litter

[N-Tyce]
I can't belive, ya'll niggas tried to deceive, slash ya cats in threes
Head wrestle with DVs on TV
They ain't ran up on the DV's yet, cuz I can pretty much bet
That we gon' put this game on check

[J-Boo]
Lyrics I keep 'em dropping, non stopping
Had 'em locked in, while ya'll niggas stay clocking
Watching, waiting for my time to shine
Hating ones get down at the drop of a dime

[Champ Diva]
Uh, shit, don't be mad or nothing, my bitches
Travel with us, ya'll hilarious
Platinum plus, my niggas get down for us
Aim to bust, ashes to dust to dust

[Finesse]
Get nasty, dirty, little birdy
My flow curvy, bow down, you ain't worthy
Know your heard me, I ain't even got to tell you
How to serve it early, hit the ground with the severed

[N-Tyce]
And you wonder why we left at ya'll, acting like
The primadon', but you the passenger
You got me in the jab like the bunny, calling me honey
You cake like counterfeit money, and then we hit you with that bummy

[J-Boo]
Catch your fast stack, my crew be veterans
We don't want no beef, cuz we vegetarian
Lasting with my dogs, and you deaf like what
Lead you back to the lab, when you mold in the cut

[Champ Diva]
If you get burned, or worst, then the feelings are hurt
Or burnt down, Venoms like, no doubt
Can't wait to blow, now, blaow, ready to show
Ya'll, how we rock

[Chorus: Finesse]
All you fake ones, no shorts, we take them
Put life in front, living with your hand on the gun
You gotta make runs, double funds and income
And them some, for stealing, but ya job ain't done

[Finesse]
You kick the fine time, sippin' zippin', no wine
And going crime time, with a discharged thing
I ain't no, character chick, I crash your whip
When the plane get all up in your face and hawk spit

[N-Tyce]
Yo, b, they be acting like it's ok
But boys will be boys and they don't play, doing things they own way
Don't let a lady step in, keeping it real as deaf
Knowing the deal is deaf, making a deal with them

[J-Boo]
Yo, what the dealy, you counterfeiter niggas wanna feel me
Cuz when I bring the drama, we can all get illy
I sit back, while Chamel' roll the fat philly
You wanna stank me, don't be silly, not really

[Finesse]
Yeah, so don't front on me, cuz all the other honeys
Acting like you got some money, rolling with a crew of dummies
Styles funny, funny style all day
We don't get down that way, the certain games we don't play

[N-Tyce]
Yo, I'mma pull your card nigga, you steady try'nna be a hard nigga
But you ain't really got the heart nigga
Cuz when you bluff, I can see it from a mile away
Don't come around my way, cuz I ain't down to play

[J-Boo]
Yo, you fake cats, don't be exploding on tracks
Get murked on the scene, all my team intact
Now run it back, you know how we do, flippin' stacks
You counterfeiter, and ya'll niggas is more than rap

[Champ Diva]
From the D to the V, slowly killing me
Like the Refugees, now it's time to flee
Poisonous, venomous, I told ya'll
Once you cross my path, you'se a goner
But then again, we out to make a kill again
Shorty Viper, the Poison, the Scorpion, Chameleon
Out to get the million, son
Haha, niggas don't want none

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
