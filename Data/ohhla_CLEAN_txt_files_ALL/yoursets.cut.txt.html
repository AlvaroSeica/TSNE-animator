{Lord Infamous}
Lord Infamous hella rough, we tearin every city up

we layin cartridges, and droppin hostages, with no apologies 
we breakin laws my nig, this nigga big business bitch 
a war is in order, get a bullet and hit em hit em hit em

{Juicy J}

Memphis bitch killers from the Evergreen Garden 
we don't set trip, for my niggas doin time in two or one 
for their crimes, lets get in the gangsta line 
and throw the funky town sign 
I'm on that other level (level) 
go grab the shovel (shovel) 
cause many bodies drop and sever (sever) 
so meet the devil (devil) 
creep up with plastic hard as wood (wood) 
cause hater would (would) 
run thru our hood but our hood (hood)
is like no good (good) 
I wish you could (could)

{Never}
representing all y'all on a mission 
tryin to make a bill, what you want what? 
Never be buck, tear da club up better duck 
who that wanna take the opposition better throw it up 
its the Conflict and the Mafia Tre' 6 and us droppin ya 
from the Chi-  but you wont drop, I'm poppin ya 
I be the outcast till the last time and I'm 
puttin em up in the guillotine, you know what I mean 
swept you clean off your feet 
street sweep till the beat heat till you go seek and peak 
what I mean your gree-dy, ain't we tricky 
who that was in the cut gettin rough? 
who that be? that be the Flict from Chicago to Memphis 
want stress and your emphasis on 
bullshit but you didn't know we was on

{Kilo}

Kilo been ready in Tennessee, got you hoe, how you like Hennesey? 
can't help it to be bogus mayn, grew up pimpin and I done slanged 
gang banged with my foes, really didn't mind it hustlin's great 
desperado, and I chose my home 
when I'm out there like an ice cold catacomb 
now in the storm, got ya rollin up the window 
keep your arms in so heat up 
when it comes too crucial throw it up 
gettin scummy dirty money nigga throw your set up

{Wildstyle}
load the clip I'm known to rip up but you wanna get it on 
send up the Tech anybody wanna flex the Chi- 
I'm a bet you die, when the bangers ride 
its a one-on-one war battle 
showdown for anybody want some get yourself knocked out 
we bogus nigga, anty up trigger, Chi-Town killers 
all mighty go getters, now what's it be like? 
flaggin my set, we outlaws, we creep our way 
bring it on gone getcha thug on

{Cold Hard}
