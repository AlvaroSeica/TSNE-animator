Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro]
They say I'm trippin, I'm not a hater
They say I'm trippin, but I'm not a hater
Now it's on and it's on and it's on again
Now it's on
Fuck Lil G

[Verse 1: King Lil G]
Fuck Lil G
I don't wanna listen to none of that bullshit
Talkin' bout hoes and all that hood shit
He fucken swears he swears he has that good shit
Little G you ain't no star
Fuck your beats and your lame ass bars
You ain't really killin' em, you ain't that hard
Fuck your songs they so retarded
But you don't really hear me tho
Fuck your punk ass videos
Ima write you a comment
There's something that you really really need to know
Cause I hate it, hate it, hate it and I really can't stand it
I said I hate it, hate it, hate it and I hope they ban it
Ima write you a fucken diss song and tag you in it
I'm lookin' at my pen right now and I wish that I could stab you with it
And fuck the Sucios tryna talk to my girl on the internet
Bitch I told you to block em, what the fuck yo
I ain't really having it
Please bitch, I'm not hating on his punk ass
Weak ass raps, just reply fucken dumb ass

[Kyrptonite]
I'm at the door, four-four
Face the floor, making more
Money knew you haters up in [?] in the case of drugs on my bike by the liquor store
Hating on the homie from the gate wanna test my fate
I was on Myspace tryna get a little promotion
Tell me where a homie went wrong
And I bet you that he's floating in the ocean (yeah)
With those Facebook lames
And those hating ass tweeters
Go and talk your shit about me
Then go ask me for a feature
Talkin' bout damn Kryptonite sucks
How the fuck did he get those songs with Ne-Yo?
Never heard a song from him in my life
How the fuck is he cool with those thousands of people?
I don't know ho, know that your ho goes solo to my show
Girl wakes up in the mo-mo, tryna get a photo
Bangin' on my door like the motherfucken po-po (yeah)
Ima tellem that promo, shoot a little video
And just so you know tho
Kryptonite and Lil G bust our nuts on her face
And she said that her man was a homo (oh)
No comments homie
Better check yo self before you wreck yourself
Tryna band on the motherfucken internet
Knowing that you never get out of your house (ha ha)

Go take your pictures
Go write your comments
We're making money
You're making nonsense [x2]

[Outro: King Lil G]
They say I'm trippin, I'm not a hater
They say I'm trippin, but I'm not a hater
Now it's on and it's on and it's on again
Now it's on and it's on and it's on again [x2]</pre>
