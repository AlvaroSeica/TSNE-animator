[Verse 1]
Darkness falls upon the land, darts and sword
Will mar and maul, marauder slams, slaughter the clans
Forcing my hand, you're found dead, torture your fam
Aura is grand, so bow head, arouse dread
Awe and the horror, the clouds red
Call on the father, you're brought to altar
And tied, bound, I swarm with the chakras
And strike down, Poison spiked pit trap
The fall's fatal, poised as my wings flap
The war angel, bludgeon, bash
Hunt and capture, summon wrath
Dungeon master, Wondrous slasher
Assail there's blood, sullen mannered
Wear velvet glove, I'll strongly fight
There's harsh gory fright, on dark stormy night			

[Chorus]
soul is blessed, delivered from danger, I'm so possessed
I overstep the limits of nature
Divine chapters, sharp brown daggers
The time lapses, dark clouds gather

[Verse 2]
Breastplate, crossbow and helmet
Vexate, scorch foes in hell pit		
You pray as you wave the crucifix
Afraid of the raving lunatic			
The reigning pugilist, I conjure styles
The prey is numerous, I'm on the prowl			
Specially selected chosen one, crowned
Heavily defended, foes is gunned down			
You're undersiege in undersea fortress
You'll suffer, bleed, the hunter's remorseless		
Supernatural, use the magical orb
Duel is tactical, cruel attack on the horde		
Foes who imitate the vision can't compete kid
Solo infiltration mission has completed				
Cold hearted, sadistic avenger
Zones guarded, the mystic defender			

[Chorus]
soul is blessed, delivered from danger, I'm so possessed
I overstep the limits of nature
Divine chapters, sharp brown daggers
The time lapses, dark clouds gather
