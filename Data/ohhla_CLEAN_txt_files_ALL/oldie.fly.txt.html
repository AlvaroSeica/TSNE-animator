[OG Spanish Fly]
Speeding up the block, dodging all the cops
Ain't trying to see me end up at the spot
Just another case, just another number, just another motherfucker gotta wonder
How you got it like that, how you got these flows
How you always end up everyday with hoes
I just kick back and relax and smoke those, I just kick back and relax and smoke those
I know the Low Pros, 1520's in this house
Got a joint in my hand, blunt in my mouth, gun to the sky, bumping More Bounce
Party's on and cracking, bitches, hoes are stacking
In Dago Town we don't fuck around, down to blaze a pound, down to lay em down
With this gangster sound coming round through your speakers
We choking, no tweekers, we ass and tit seekers bumping loud through your speakers
It's that vato Maniac kicking back smoking on a sack
Drinking by the back, sipping Congac in the Lac
In the back, roll it up, pass it back

[Silencer]
Well it's me Silencer about to kick another verse to an oldie
All the hynas all around the world know the name of this homey
Bitches I'm slapping, I'm the baddest when you see me rapping
Babydoll I'm your peloncito and I'm your papacito
Everytime I'm gonna bust a flow everyone wants to come and see the show
Say you wanna know what I'm all about
Silencer is in the house to make you bounce
And the hynas all around wanted this, enemies are never ever gonna last
So I'm gonna blast, putting everything up in their past
The rules, I'm gonna break em and the hoes, I'm gonna take em
Now it's time for me to go and kick it
All the hynas wanna come and kick it
I'm rolling and smoking, for reals I'm not joking
I'm blasting and laughing, for reals I'm not joking

[OG Spanish Fly]
Swig and take a sip, never slip, always tripping and dipping
Always smoking and choking and loc'ing and poking your girl
Then twirl around and roll another joint and puff it up, so what the fuck we here for
What's the beer for, it's a 2-triple-0 year so Low Profile is here, on no
Watch when I come, duck when I buck
I don't give a fuck I'll keep you in a truck
Keep on rolling down the stream till your body's rotting and floating in a creek
Never will the cops see, who was he, just another victim of society
Fucking around with me will leave your ass six feet under the D-I-R-T</pre>
