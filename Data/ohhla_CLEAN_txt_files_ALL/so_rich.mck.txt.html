Song:   So Rich, So Pretty
Typed by: erikaldrich@hotmail.com

I like a girl with caked up makeup
In the sunshine smoking cigarettes to pass the time
Who wakes up to a bottle of wine on the nightstand
Bites and scratches the blinds
But I ain't found one quite right yet
So I step with pep to the park or supermarket
Her apartment best be messy
Alisa don't mind when I call her Leslie 
She's gotta dress with class
And Jean Paul Gaultier and a Hermes bag 
And four inch tips made of Ostrich
Sharp enough to slit your wrists her lips spread gossip
Won't say sorry when she offends
She comes over to my place in her old man's Benz
In gold and silver and jewels of all colors
And she doesn't take them off when we're tearing up the covers

[Chorus One]
Come on and get it before I change my mind
Come on kid, don't waste my time
So rich, so pretty
The best piece of ass in the whole damn city
So rich, so pretty...

I like a girl who eats and brings it up
A sassy little frassy with bulimia
Her best friend's a plastic surgeon
And when her Beamer's in the shop she rolls the Benz
Manis and pedis on Sundays and Wednesdays
Money from mommy lovely in Versace
Costly sprees, it's on at Barney's
And I love to watch her go through fifty G's calmly
She gets naughty with her pilates body
And thinks it's really funny when her nose goes bloody
Because the blow is so yummy and it keeps her tummy empty
And makes her act more friendly
Dance the night away
And she won't say nothing when she makes your man stray

[Chorus Two]
Come on and get it before I change my mind
Come on kid, don't waste my time
So rich, so pretty
Come on and get it before I change my mind
Come on kid, don't waste my time
So rich, so pretty
The best piece of ass in this whole damn city

I've had your kind before, Mickey
Go get my purse, Mickey
Lock the door, Mickey
You're just a midnight snack
Shhhh, don't talk back
You're just a boy Mickey
You're just a toy Mickey
You're just a boy Mickey

[Chorus Three]
Come on and get it before I change my mind
Come on kid, don't waste my time
So rich, so pretty
The best piece of ass in this whole damn city
So rich, so pretty
So rich, so pretty
So rich, so pretty
The best piece of ass in this whole damn city

so rich, so pretty
so rich, so rich
so pretty, so pretty
Mickey, Mickey
so pretty, so pretty
Mickey, Mickey
the best piece of ass in this whole damn city
Mickey, Mickey
the best piece of ass in this whole damn city
Mickey, Mickey
the best piece of ass in this whole damn city
Mickey, Mickey</pre>
