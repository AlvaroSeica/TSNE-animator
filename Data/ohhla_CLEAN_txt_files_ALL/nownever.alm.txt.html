Typed by: DaSun Akbar

(Chorus) Solomon Childs
Yeah, I refuse to go under
Somehow its gotta get better
It's now or never
And money on the wood
Make the deal go good
Somehow its gotta get better
It's now or never

[Son One]
Yeah, gray skies, another day without the sun again
Young stomach is rumbling, money is not coming in
Summers, we was budgeting, winters we was struggling
Bitter 'cause the only heat we had was from the oven
And the kitchen and the cupboard was bare, peanut butter plus
Bread one way, over another our hunger got fed
Moms made sure that her seed could eat
Please believe, we seen dope-fiends on Regal street
And that's not where we need to be
Two jobs is hard and moms didn't even sleep
All in effort just to move up like Jefferson's
People walked the street; I could see life stressing them
Looking for their blessing in the sky
And feeling they're deprived, just wishing they could fly
I see a ribbon in the sky
Feeling any minute they could die
Missing optimism, tear drop dripping from their eyes...
Single mothers hold your head, people pushing hard
Playing both roles, plus the father never took the job
Cut from the cloth of a survivors war
They say dying is easy, life is hard

[5-Star]
Now I seen both sides of the lines as designed by the Master
The final chapter brings the Rapture, full force
On course to break out the chains
Israelites vains got me seeking faster lanes
Hunger pains merge with migraines
And leaves stains across the ghetto
It's the birth of Romulo
Everybody gotta eat, so the streets holds wars
I'm clutching the sword and I swing like Reggie Jackson
With the passion for survival
It almost seems vital, how I'm breaking out the cycle
With the mind-state that illuminates through the terror-dome
Where bones of black males consumed caskets
In jail cells - we twist L's
And inhale the sweet smokes with the hopes of escape
My words make rebels salivate at the thought
I'm caught in the clutches of the dutches
Street's filled with murdering ruckus
My shells toughness similar to Teflon
War's for Exxon, seeing far when the blocks scars of fresh
Crocodile death will take your last breath

[M-80]
I make moves
'Cause I refuse to go under
So used to getting over
And I don't mean the shoulder
Its on the arm whenever
The God is in your neck of
The woods righteous teacher
Keep on speak on we need ya
And so I - control I
To know why - that no wise
Men lie and men die
When men try to men ties
My mental is fundamental
I grab the pad and the pencil
Begin to stencil
All the shit I'm into
And been through
Seen and touched
Breathed and Heard
Tasted success and put the formula first
That's why I, never forget
Why I, never will sweat
Making, skyscraper paper
And I'm on top of my shit
Get it...wake up!

(Chorus) Solomon Childs
Yeah, I refuse to go under
Somehow its gotta get better
It's now or never
And money on the wood
Make the deal go good
Somehow its gotta get better
It's now or never
It's now or never
It's now or never
Somehow its gotta get better
It's now or never
Money on the wood
Make the deal go good
Somehow its gotta get better
It's now or never
It's now or never
It's now or never</pre>
