[Verse 1]
I could run with you
I could roll with you
I could rock with you
Walk the dog for you
Stop to talk to you
Block the block for you
And I won't stop till that beat drops
You could see in me
Breathe so easily
Speak so peacefully
Please to meet ya we've greeted recently
Tweeted frequently
And I won't stop till that beat drops
Like some Reeboks
I'm so classic
I make ya knees knock
I'm so nasty
Classy, doin gymnastics for practice
I'm bombastic
Enthusiastic
Crem de la crem them fools you be passin
They made of plastic
I'm organic
They so frantic see how they flock
And I won't stop till that beats drops

[Hook]
I be up on it
That's how I like it
Grab the microphone and
That's how I ride it
That's how I write it
I write about the moment
I'm on it
Yeeeaaahhhh

[Verse 2]
I can make your day
Stay awake and play
Jake the snake was a fake, I'm A-OK
You can take away
Say no way jose
Cuz I won't stop till that beat drops
We could run away
Two is one today
Speakin in tongues only we understand
We could be in wonderland
But I won't stop till that beat drops
You know you need not worry
You're worthy
Like James, your game's filled with strength and flurries of furious action
Scurrying fast and
Most can't imagine the passion you have and we never be a fraction
We all of it
Yes we all love it
And they can tell we ain't askin we grabbin we have to have satisfaction
And we won't stop till that beat drops

[Hook]
I be up on it
That's how I like it
Grab the microphone and
That's how I ride it
That's how I write it
I write about the moment
I'm on it
Yeeeaaahhhh

[Verse 3]
At times people say that I'm a crazy guy
Cuz I don't have a pair of khakis or a navy tie
People look at me and think, oh, he may be high
Make no mistake, I can motivate a lazy eye
I stay inside
You could say that I'm a home addict
Chillin in my cold addict
I'm never nomadic
More bounce to the ounce, nope never no static
And I won't stop till that beat drops
So dramatic
Like a soldier I told ya
No traumatic's gonna slow the composure
Flow emphatically
Ecstatically
Got a text from my ex I was glad to see
It ain't a tragedy factually we flourished
Morris less like Zachary
Less is more I'm deep like a reservoir
I think it's time for the hook
Oh yes of course

[Hook]
I be up on it
That's how I like it
Grab the microphone and
That's how I ride it
That's how I write it
I write about the moment
I'm on it
Yeeeaaahhhh

[Verse 4]
I could run with you
I could roll with you
I could rock with you
Walk the dog for you
Stop to talk to you
Block the block for you
And I won't stop till that beat drops
You could see in me
Breathe so easily
Speak so peacefully
Please to meet ya we've greeted recently
