Welcome to G.S.P.N. I'm your host Gena G-String
And this is Sportscenter version Thug.1
Topping our broadcast is the stunning upset victory
By the underestimated rapper Max Minelli
Over player-haters and bitch-ass niggaz
In the rap game.For more highlights
Let's go to the man himself
Broadcasting live, from the game

[Verse One]
First and Ten, I be pimpin' my pen
I'm a Pro Bowl pick before the season begin
I been favored to win, nigga place ya gamble
Ten grand in the pocket, now watch me scramble
I'ma be the first die when it kick off
Police want the corner back, lookin' for the pickoff
Tryin'a pick a vic off, but I ain't never skurd
They call me Max Clemons, I'm pitchin' them bitches curves
I'm out'chere in the bottom of the third tryin' ta fastball
Colder than a hockey puck, skate clean past y'all
That's why 'ere still be a few niggaz that hatin'
Keep a .45 on me, call that a safety
Got two bad knees, but I'm used to playin' with pain
My nigga Loc touch down, that's the play of the game
When it's fourth and long with one tick on the clock
Bitch I'm the go-to man, nigga can't be stopped

[Chorus]
I came to play, I'm playin' to win
Now let the games begin, It's on now
Everything happen in my hood be a highlight
Hustlin' is a highlight, thuggin' is a highlight
Halftime
I'm deep in the game, I'm playin to win
My nigga fourth and ten, It's on now
Everything happen in my hood be a highlight
Beefin' is a highlight, keepin' niggaz' mind right
Full court

[Verse Two]
I can't be short stopped, I stay on top of my block
Fiends keep runnin' back hollin' pass me the rock
My lil' partner in the zone, slangin' D by the Fence
Niggaz comin' through for the sack, tryin' ta get blitzed
Last time he caught a charge man his life was a mess
Had him in the Full Court, TV cameras and Press
Heart pumpin' Powerade, I'm a straight up menace
Causin' racket, and them hos just love my tenni's
Brushin' dirt off of my soulja pads
Muggin' like a face mask
Bustin' 'em up, I'm undisputed every weight class
Put up a hundred
I damn near punted
When the dirty feds had my main man double covered
Fuck Sony
They phony 'till they, come with a budget
I'ma be with this Indy tryin' ta move 500
This game, I love it, I'm on, I'm goin' hard
Like I'm playin' in the dome wit a broke arm
Thugged out

[Chorus]
I came to play, I'm playin' to win
Now let the games begin, It's on now
Everything happen in my hood be a highlight
Hustlin' is a highlight, thuggin' is a highlight
Halftime
